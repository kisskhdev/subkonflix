WEBVTT

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:22.580
Kin.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.260
What are you doing here?

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.730
You're soaked. You'll get sick.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.440
I just finished basketball practice.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.880
I went back,
knowing you had no umbrella.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.320
I'm worried about you.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.080
Just wait for the rain to stop
or borrow from someone.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.780
I don't want to wait long.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:43.470
I missed you.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.880
Have you eaten anything yet?

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.850
Not yet. Go get something to eat?

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.060
Let's go.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:52.930
Okay.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.440
- Kin
- What?

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.520
If I ask you to be my boyfriend now,

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.820
is that too childish?

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.500
Why do you ask that?

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.360
I'm afraid you'll find someone else
before I grow up

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.490
Then grow up fast.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.160
All right, I'll grow up fast.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.400
Grow up to catch up to you.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.310
Grow up and pass you.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.110
I'll wait.

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.910
Promise you'll wait until I grow up.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.039
Than.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.540
If I squeeze the toothpaste
every day like this,

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.860
will you be my boyfriend?

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.140
Asking again? Why so often?

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.520
You never give me an answer.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.320
Then letting you move in,
what do you call that?

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.030
A high school junior
staying with a senior temporarily.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.870
Up to you if you want to
think it's only that.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.310
Then tell me what we are.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.770
I want to hear it from you now.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.410
Then listen carefully.

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:34.610
Boyfriends.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.260
See? You said it.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.900
So now I'm your boyfriend.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.490
You heard it. That's how it is.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.530
My boyfriend, my boyfriend.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.510
We're a couple now.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:57.810
Can we do it then?

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.560
Go get your ID first.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.590
Why?

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.320
How old are you this year?

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.910
Wait until 18.
I don't want to go to jail.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.440
I'm even willing to lose
my innocence to you.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.590
- Naughty.
- You don't want to?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.050
Go brush your teeth.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.680
Don't you have an exam tomorrow?

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.510
Sleep early or you'll be late.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.500
Brush your teeth.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.700
Pond, did you come alone?

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.650
It's probably my phone
and Mr. Don's are close

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.790
I'm tired of being hidden.
Please go back.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.330
The one right for you isn't me.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.030
Your room has no family photos?

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.430
Usually there are photos of
parents and kids on the wall

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.450
or on a desk or something.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.030
Do you like Uncle Than?

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.540
Good night, Marwin.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.450
Good night.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.740
Mr. Don had an accident.
I'm going to the scene.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.140
Where is it?

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.100
Is he badly hurt?

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.130
Not far from me. I'll hurry there.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.310
Is there a power outage in you room,
Kin? Marwin?

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.580
I'd like to leave Marwin
in your room for a bit.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.330
Mr. Don just had an accident nearby.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.490
People from my office
are heading there.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.320
Okay. Please keep me updated.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.010
Hope him all right.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.080
Thank you.

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.780
Stay in my room tonight, Marwin.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.260
You're very late.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.030
What happened to your face?

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:28.400
Pond, Mr. Don had an accident.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:30.910
Please come quickly.

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:21.640
We had to part
when I wasn’t ready to say goodbye

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:26.700
The pain was burning deep inside

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.030
Only now I start to see

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:36.190
What it really means,
living life without you next to me

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:46.910
I know the reason
you had to walk away

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:52.080
It broke your heart in every way

00:09:52.630 --> 00:10:01.730
What you went through
hurt you just the same

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:59.150
Even if we had to say goodbye

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:06.250
I still believe we truly tried

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:13.060
I never regretted
the love we gave away

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:19.060
Never a single regret,
not even one day

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:28.320
Every moment we had
still softly stays

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:33.840
Just missing our last goodbye
we never had to say

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:45.650
Though our time together
was so brief

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:51.360
It was enough to know
what love truly is, I believe

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:57.090
I came to understand,
all because of you

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:05.420
Even if we had to say goodbye

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:14.470
Love each other

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:16.740
but create no bonds of love.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:20.270
And let love be like a moving sea

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.890
between your two souls.

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:27.310
I'll leave the key card here.
You can come back anytime.

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:31.670
But please come back.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.850
The one right for you isn't me.

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:48.500
I wish I could have held you tight

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:54.090
Just one last time before goodbye

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:59.190
Before we’d never meet again/i>

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.310
Are you okay?

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:08.070
Life is shorter than we think, Than.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:10.970
That's true.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:17.160
I never knew
Pond and Mr. Don were together.

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:20.540
Kin.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:27.360
Don't let "if" or "but" or "wait"

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.290
block our way.

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:34.010
When I love someone,
I say I love them.

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:37.400
When I find the right one,

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.420
I hold his hand as tight as I can.

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:48.210
I don't know which day
I'll get to say it,

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:50.990
to act, or to love again.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.970
I don't need perfect love.

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.440
It doesn't have to be
right in every way.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:05.250
Let's make love simple,
like the first day we met.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.440
You think love doesn't have to be
right in every way?

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.580
What about the mistakes from the past?

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:18.990
What are they?

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:21.760
You never told me.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.440
You never gave me
a chance to explain or fix it.

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.880
Don't let the past lock us in
for our whole lives.

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:34.010
I don't want to waste time waiting
for the day we understand.

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:44.180
If the past makes you hesitate,
let's forget it.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.250
And let's try loving again

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.450
without looking back, can we?

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.150
Give our two hearts another chance.

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.220
That's all for the client's feedback.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:36.550
From now on, Mr. Thawat will take over
Mr. Don's projects.

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:39.950
I'd like to thank everyone very much.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:44.430
Thank you, Mind.

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:51.800
Has anyone talked to Pond
after the funeral?

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:55.590
I'll try calling him.

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:58.520
I texted him.
He read it but didn't reply.

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:25.130
Yes?

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.130
Please thank everyone for me.

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:33.810
I'll come in next week.

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:18.100
Cameraman, today I had to pay
the price you asked.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:19.860
Which is very expensive.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:23.110
Though I laughed at our small victory,

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:25.220
inside I was amazed.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:27.940
You didn't just set your price,

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:31.990
you told the world
you value yourself.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:33.980
And I should agree.

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:42.420
When I got home, I had to
throw away a bottle of perfume

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:44.320
because of that same cameraman.

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:49.540
It was a rude critique,
but the most honest one.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:54.200
Too honest for the society I live in.

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:56.610
It made me start to think

00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:01.010
my world should have you in it.

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:09.740
I once thought what we had
was only temporary.

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:13.440
But every time our bodies touched,

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.460
became part of each other,

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:19.600
it made me feel it was my true self.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:23.250
A soul I never knew before.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.840
Because I did it without knowing.

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:27.690
You became part of my life.

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:30.360
We seem completely mismatched,

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:35.330
but you are the one
who lets me be myself most

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.250
when we are together.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.130
I'm sorry

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:43.190
for fearing our relationship
would change how the world sees me.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:47.670
Sorry for making you
seem meaningless.

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:52.510
Sorry for loving you
but not daring to say it aloud.

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.510
My guilt for hiding you from the world

00:20:56.590 --> 00:21:00.990
makes you feel
you have no value in my world.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:05.700
You are sincerity
when I was still pretending.

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.650
You are courage
when I was still a coward.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:16.570
You are the home I never knew
I was searching for.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.330
If I still have a chance,

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:22.740
I won't make love a secret again.

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:26.220
Can you come back?

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:29.260
I don't ask for a perfect world,

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.710
only a world with you in it.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:36.140
Now I know how terrible this world is without you.

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:40.290
Please come back, my cameraman.

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:45.920
Every moment we had
still softly stays

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:51.820
Just missing our last goodbye
we never had to say

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:59.390
I wish I could have held you tight

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:04.740
Just one last time before goodbye

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:09.750
Before we’d never meet again

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:17.600
I never regretted
the love we gave away

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:23.930
Never a single regret,
not even one day

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:33.000
Every moment we had
still softly stays

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.980
Just missing our last goodbye
we never had to say

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:01.210
How about we row to
build some energy?

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:03.850
Indy, this is not the mood.

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.770
Yes, bro.

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:26.680
What is the paper for, AJ?

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:30.340
I have a task for you all.

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:33.230
If the last minute of
your life arrived,

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:35.810
who would you say "I love you" to?

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:37.850
Try writing it down.

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:41.750
And what would you do for them?

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:06.550
Then what next?

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:08.360
Try reading it.

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:14.820
What do you want to do
and say to the one you love

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.550
before they leave this world?

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:21.910
Why don't we do it
before the last minute comes?

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.160
I think saying "I love you"
isn't that hard.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.350
I love Too.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.190
I love Kin.

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:32.390
I love Indy.

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:34.360
And I love Fai too.

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:38.050
Thank you so much, AJ.

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:41.660
Don't let the last minute come

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:45.060
without a chance to tell
those we love.

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:03.250
(Visit my parents)
(Love Than again)

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:16.380
I'll keep our last minutes
together in this room.

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:21.550
I'm glad that once in my life

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:29.230
I met someone like you,
shared my life with you.

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:35.090
Though our time together was so short,

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:45.570
every minute will stay in my heart

00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:47.580
forever.

00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:51.300
No matter where you are now,

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:53.690
please know that

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:58.790
I will never forget that
once we loved.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:04.340
Even if we had to say goodbye

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:11.160
I still believe we truly tried

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:15.120
See you again.

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.590
My important client.

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:24.270
I never regretted
the love we gave away

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:30.520
Never a single regret,
not even one day

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:37.060
I'm not late, right?

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:38.240
Almost.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.340
What were you doing?
You're drenched in sweat.

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.150
That's right,
working out so early, AJ?

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.050
Gotta make it worth it.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.250
Worth what?

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:50.650
Nut said the gym will close soon.

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:53.560
Not many users, profits too low.

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:55.950
So they'll merge with
the Sukhumvit branch.

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:02.360
Then let's finish
Mr. Thawat's project summary first.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.740
As for Nut and Than,

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.360
we'll see how we can help them.

00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:07.900
Okay.

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.100
Then get ready to present.

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:18.210
Why don't you tell me?

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.940
Wow, who are you going to war with?

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:54.440
We're here to do something fun.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:55.440
Are you all ready?

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:56.450
Yes.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.900
You are joining too?

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:11.880
Of course.
A model my age can still do it.

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.190
I'm still fit too.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:15.780
Marwin will help too.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:17.790
Me too.

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:21.530
Don't forget,
I'm a professional model.

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:24.810
Than, if something's wrong,
why not tell us?

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:26.700
We're always ready to help.

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:38.080
Pond.

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:40.940
How could this job go
without the top photographer?

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:42.790
Thank you, bro.

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:45.800
Thank you, everyone.

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:49.290
It's nothing, Than.
This is our specialty.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.000
Don't forget we are...

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:54.320
Beyond Perfect House of Perfection.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.220
With today's big campaign,
New Start, New Strength.

00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:59.270
A new start, strong together.

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:01.280
- Ready?
- No.

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:02.900
What? Are you ready?

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:03.550
Yes.

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:04.320
Are you ready?

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:04.870
Yes.

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:06.250
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.280
If you're ready, let's go!

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:09.260
Let's go.

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:17.880
Smile, okay.

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:19.890
One, two, three.

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:21.690
You turn this way.

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:30.130
- Pretend to laugh.
- Yes.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.650
Punch out. To the camera.
Yes, hold it.

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.190
One, two, three.

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.020
Okay.

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:52.080
I'll tell you how to pose.

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:54.960
- I'll kick.
- That's good.

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:56.920
Kick, one, two, three.

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:59.290
Good, beautiful.

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:03.650
Hold the dumbbell
with your left hand, yes.

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:05.560
You can smile.

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:08.400
Put you hand here. Another here.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.130
Perfect, bro.

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:22.830
Bigger would be better.

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:27.990
That's very big.

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:35.560
Okay, one, two, three.

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:39.940
Okay, one, two, three.

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.690
Okay, good.

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.060
Than, stand next to Kin.

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:58.850
One, two, three. Three, two, one.

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:00.190
Okay.

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.980
- This one is cute.
- Stay still.

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:17.140
Be fresh. Pretend to talk to him.

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.740
One, two...

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:25.180
Last one, two poses. One, two, three.

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:26.800
Yes, that's perfect.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:30.970
I must thank Too, Akin,

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:33.710
and the entire Beyond Perfect team.

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:36.200
Thank you.

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:43.140
And thanks to all
our VIP models as well.

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.490
No problem, Nut.
We're all family here.

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:50.110
It's nothing.
I'm always your supporter.

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:52.590
Getting to do something fun
like this once in a while

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.570
gives us more energy too.

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.210
Everyone worked hard all day.

00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:00.990
May I treat everyone
to dinner as thanks?

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:03.480
Sure.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.240
Of course it has to be like that.

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:08.640
We all worked for free today,
not a single fee.

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:10.170
AJ.

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:13.470
Of course, Nut. We'd be happy.

00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:15.180
- AJ.
- Yes.

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:16.640
Book a table and order the food.

00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:19.330
Seafood nearby. Close and good.

00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:20.220
Okay.

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:24.190
I think I left my shoes
in the changing room.

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:25.360
I'll go get them first.

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:31.060
You go to the restaurant first.

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:32.970
I'll wait for Kin and follow you.

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:34.710
- Okay.
- Okay, let's go.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.240
- Let's go.
- Let's eat shrimp today.

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:40.950
- Nene, want crab fried rice?
- I want deep-fried seafood.

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:45.300
I'll chew it till it's smooth.

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:52.110
Did you find them?

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:53.490
I did.

00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:59.130
Thank you.
You always helped me before,

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:00.360
stayed by my side.

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:03.110
Thank you again, Kin.

00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:05.100
I'll help however I can.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:06.840
If I can do something, I will.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:10.450
Then can you help me
with one more thing?

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:12.440
What is it?

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:19.550
Let's start over again,
like we used to, Kin.

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:27.140
Before we start again,

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:32.360
are you ready to face
what you left in the past?

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:38.330
I don't know what you mean,

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:41.100
but I'm ready

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.990
if it lets us love each other again,

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:55.620
If you're ready,

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:57.610
tomorrow,

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:01.680
we'll face what made us
go separate ways,

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:05.160
what you once did,

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:09.300
the wound still in our hearts today.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:24.639
Okay.

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:27.590
No matter what we face,

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:32.370
please don't let go of
my hand again.

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:16.710
Mom.

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:27.370
How was it?
I heard you had a shoot yesterday.

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:29.300
Yes, it was very fun.

00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:31.210
Why do you have so many things?

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.630
Dad lets me stay for two nights.

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:37.210
So I brought toys and storybooks.

00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:40.090
Then let's put your things
in the room first.

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:43.400
Take a shower
and change your clothes too.

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:44.300
Okay.

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:47.340
- Kla, take him, please.
- Yes.

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:48.540
Okay.

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:51.150
Let's go, Marwin.

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:58.020
Akin, come sit first.
I have a new snack for you to try.

00:35:59.310 --> 00:35:59.900
Meya.

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:03.380
I'm sorry for breaking my promise.

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:08.080
But I want you to meet someone.

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:10.160
Who is it?

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:16.830
Hello.

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:19.180
Hello.

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:28.850
Meya is Marwin's mother.

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:31.120
I see.

00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:34.230
Nice to meet you.

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:40.430
You two should remember each other.

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:47.790
Where have we met before?

00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:58.440
I'm not sure either.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.530
Meya, you don't remember Than?

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:09.550
Who is he?

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:14.730
You...

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.430
You really don't remember each other?

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:30.270
I think I've never met
Marwin's mother.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:34.870
Me neither,
I don't think I've met him.

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:39.210
Then...

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:42.740
It was Meya.

00:37:43.210 --> 00:37:46.710
- Well...
- Calling to say I was pregnant.

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:48.230
Pregnant?

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:53.200
- We met at...
- This is not my phone.

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:55.610
He can't take the call now.

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.900
Please tell him to call me back
at this number.

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:00.220
I will.

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:07.680
But it wasn't him, Akin.

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:11.500
That day you called Than's phone.

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:20.220
I saved the number
from when he called...

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:26.600
Hello.

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:28.730
Do you remember me?

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:34.030
We met at Fashion Week.

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:37.660
Um, who is this?

00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:39.880
A secret person.

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:50.870
I don't even know your name yet.

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:53.240
I only call you the photographer.

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:56.700
Can I be your secret person?

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:08.440
Besides a secret person,

00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:11.160
you belong to someone, right?

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.260
I’m about to break up with her.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.470
I can clear it.

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:32.110
See? I’m single now.

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:33.790
See?

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:35.370
Did you miss me,
that’s why you called

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:36.820
my secret person?

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:41.620
I told you that I’d go back
and sort things out…

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:45.550
My girlfriend is pregnant.

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:49.220
What happened between us that night...

00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:51.780
I already knew you had a girlfriend.

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:55.480
What happened between us that night
was just for fun.

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:59.270
You said about clearing things up
and coming back…

00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:01.030
Do you really think I’d believe you?

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:06.620
But I’m serious. I really like you.

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:08.940
Take responsibility for what you did.

00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:11.960
With me,
it was just a one-night stand.

00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:14.060
Fun with no strings attached.

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:15.430
I…

00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:18.720
I have to go now.
I have another shoot.

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:20.730
We can talk later.

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:23.170
I probably won’t contact you again.

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:27.650
That’s fine. I understand.

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:31.320
Good luck, my secret person.

00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:02.750
When I found out I was pregnant,

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:06.130
I thought simply that
I’d end the problem.

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:09.960
I wanted to call him first
before deciding.

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:11.160
So I did.

00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:15.060
Then how did it become Than’s number?

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:19.570
I’ve never called you, Meya.

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:21.870
Wait a moment.

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:29.070
Is this your number, Than?

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:36.660
Yes. I’ve used this number all along.
I never changed it.

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:38.770
Ssecret person…

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:44.920
Where did you meet him, Meya?

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:50.080
We met at a photo shoot.

00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:51.980
He was the photographer’s assistant.

00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:08.010
Is it this person?

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:11.310
Yes.

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:13.710
Sun.

00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:15.680
Sun?

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:20.750
Dad, Mom, have you seen my phone?

00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:22.710
Where did you put it?

00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:24.310
Somewhere around here.

00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:25.980
Again?

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:27.930
Oh, isn’t that it?

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.680
That one, oh dear.

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:32.560
This is Sun's.

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:34.840
Then think carefully
where you left yours.

00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:36.510
Should I call it?

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:40.370
Bro.

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:44.650
Why did you take my phone?

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.280
Sorry, I thought it was mine.

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:50.100
Must be the hundredth time.

00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:51.440
I told you to change the case.

00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:53.460
And the lock screen is me and Kin.

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:56.560
Sorry. I was in a hurry.

00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:04.380
Dad, Mom, I have something to confess.

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:06.900
Confess? What is it?

00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:10.230
It’s Narin, my girlfriend…

00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:11.370
She’s pregnant.

00:44:24.130 --> 00:44:25.420
So that means…

00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:29.060
Mawin is Sun's son.

00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:33.140
My nephew.

00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:42.290
No, Mawin is my child.

00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:47.010
Excuse me.

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:48.820
Wait, Meya.

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:50.750
That’s enough, Akin.

00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:53.960
Stop using Mawin to
replace the one you love.

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:58.110
Now you know it’s not
what you thought.

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:00.760
Mawin is no use to you anymore.

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:06.040
I think it’s best he comes back
to having only his mother.

00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:10.680
He doesn’t need
a father or any relatives.

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:14.760
If he did, he should have
had them from birth.

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:18.760
Thank you for taking care of
my son for a while.

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:20.930
Thank you so much.

00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:24.380
Say goodbye to your uncles.

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:25.830
You’re leaving?

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:28.810
Goodbye, Uncle Kin.
Goodbye, Uncle Than.

00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:29.840
Wait, Meya.

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:32.180
Meya.

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:03.100
I’m sorry that I…

00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:04.290
It’s okay.

00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:06.940
Everything is clear now.

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:10.990
- If only I had…
- It’s fine.

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:15.260
It’s in the past.
We can’t change it now.

00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:19.230
It’s the future where we can
make things better.

00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:25.650
Meya said I used Mawin
as your replacement…

00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:27.890
that I didn’t want to help her...

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.100
- I just…
- That’s her own thought.

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.650
You know why you did what you did.

00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:39.380
Taking responsibility for
a child isn’t easy.

00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:41.990
I know it. You too.

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:46.370
I’ll find a chance to
talk to Meya myself.

00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:50.700
Mawin still has his father’s family.

00:46:51.070 --> 00:46:55.360
Grandpa, grandma, me,
and a sister like Nene.

00:46:57.090 --> 00:46:58.580
I hope Meya understands.

00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:02.710
But do you understand me now?

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:05.970
Is there anything else I must clear up?

00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:12.340
Why didn’t you ask me
directly back then?

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:14.400
Why didn’t you tell me?

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:18.700
What should I even scold you with?

00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:22.470
You’re a pure buffalo,
no cow mixed in at all.

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:26.690
So that means you two want me to…

00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:27.940
Break up.

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:32.480
Listen to me. Stop being stupid.
Stop being a buffalo.

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:34.540
Open your eyes.

00:47:35.070 --> 00:47:37.420
No matter how many chances you give,
he's always the same.

00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:38.920
You can’t change him.

00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:42.760
And believe me, you’ll never get
the truth from him.

00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:46.330
It’s a mess. A total mess.

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:49.950
I must look terrible
in your friends’ eyes.

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:52.600
It’s my fault for believing them.

00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:54.820
I let their words

00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:57.820
erase the good relationship
we had together.

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:01.140
It’s okay. I understand.

00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:04.760
They just wanted to protect you
in their own way.

00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:07.980
They care about you and love you.

00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:12.040
But the one who should have
protected you back then was me.

00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:14.240
I know you better than anyone.

00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:16.440
It’s okay.

00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:18.960
As long as now you’re with me

00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:20.830
and understand me, that’s enough.

00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:24.720
I’m sorry again, Than.

00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:30.090
I don’t know what will
happen from now on.

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:34.770
But right now,
I want a chance from you.

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:38.480
Let’s start again with the same hearts

00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:41.510
that once belonged to the two of us.

00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:46.790
Start again… how should we start?

00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:49.430
Start like this.

00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:35.060
You’re not going
anywhere again, right?

00:51:35.370 --> 00:51:36.730
I promise, Than,

00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:39.650
that I’ll never walk out of
your life again.

00:51:39.970 --> 00:51:42.280
Why are you angry at
Uncle Kin and Uncle Than?

00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:44.490
Do you still want to see your father?

00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:47.010
This isn’t the time to hide
any more truth, Than.

00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:49.470
What is the status between you two?

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:51.360
Someone wants to meet you.

00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:52.330
Who is that?

00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:55.350
We have to move out of here
by the end of this month.

00:51:55.450 --> 00:51:57.570
Try looking at the project
Mr. Don worked on.

00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:00.830
Then you’ll understand
why people in the industry regret

00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:02.230
that he’s gone.
