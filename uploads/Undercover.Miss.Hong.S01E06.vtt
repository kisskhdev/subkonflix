00:00:00.722 --> 00:00:34.059

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:38.059
{\an8}UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

00:00:49.654 --> 00:00:51.739
What an odd resemblance.

00:00:54.117 --> 00:00:54.951
Ms. Hong.

00:00:56.494 --> 00:00:57.704
Do you have an older sister?

00:00:59.831 --> 00:01:00.999
An older sister?

00:01:02.542 --> 00:01:03.710
Me?

00:01:06.963 --> 00:01:07.964
Ms. Song!

00:01:08.548 --> 00:01:10.550
Code red, level two
has been activated, ma'am.

00:01:15.305 --> 00:01:16.848
What's "code red, level two"?

00:01:16.931 --> 00:01:19.225
You work here.
How could you not know that?

00:01:22.562 --> 00:01:24.022
Would I ask if I did?

00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:28.651
Gosh, that was so close.

00:01:52.258 --> 00:01:54.719
{\an8}When will you stop neglecting my Nora?

00:01:56.763 --> 00:01:59.599
{\an8}Forcing her to be an entry-level minion
and live in the dorms

00:01:59.682 --> 00:02:01.809
{\an8}was all your doing, wasn't it?

00:02:01.893 --> 00:02:04.771
{\an8}I suggested it to the chairman
for Ms. Kang's sake.

00:02:05.647 --> 00:02:06.481
{\an8}You suggested for her sake?

00:02:08.024 --> 00:02:09.234
I expected as much.

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:13.029
You, a complete stranger,
worry about my Nora?

00:02:14.072 --> 00:02:18.201
Such an important matter should've been
discussed with me, her mother.

00:02:21.996 --> 00:02:23.831
After you divorced the chairman,

00:02:24.791 --> 00:02:27.085
you got remarried, divorced,
married a third time,

00:02:27.168 --> 00:02:28.544
before landing your third divorce.

00:02:29.128 --> 00:02:32.215
Meanwhile, the one who took care of
her school life and her peer relationships

00:02:32.298 --> 00:02:33.633
was me.

00:02:33.716 --> 00:02:34.801
Why you…

00:02:38.304 --> 00:02:39.764
If you really care about Ms. Kang,

00:02:40.974 --> 00:02:43.017
I suggest you refrain
from visiting the office.

00:02:46.312 --> 00:02:47.146
Ju-ran.

00:02:47.855 --> 00:02:51.067
Do I look like some pathetic woman
who needs to rely on a man to live?

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.151
I never said such--

00:02:52.235 --> 00:02:54.487
And what makes you so different?

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.239
You're worse if anything.

00:02:57.115 --> 00:03:00.034
You're just an elevator girl
who lucked out and scored the chairman.

00:03:00.118 --> 00:03:01.160
"Chief of Staff"? Please.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.329
But did you know?

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.375
The house you live in,
the car you drive, and even this office

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.837
can disappear into thin air
with a word from the chairman.

00:03:12.714 --> 00:03:14.799
At least, I got my divorce settlement.

00:03:14.882 --> 00:03:17.093
You'll be kicked out with nothing.

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:26.185
Remember that.

00:03:31.733 --> 00:03:32.650
"Outstanding Women"?

00:03:35.486 --> 00:03:36.529
What the hell is this?

00:03:37.238 --> 00:03:38.072
How tacky.

00:03:39.991 --> 00:03:43.119
You're wasting the company's money
on this sort of nonsense, aren't you?

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.580
Save it for a decent outfit.

00:03:56.215 --> 00:03:59.052
The Outstanding Women Employees' Club
was established in October 1993

00:03:59.135 --> 00:04:01.554
to benefit Hanmin's female staff.

00:04:01.637 --> 00:04:04.307
I'm only doing this as a favor to you.

00:04:05.058 --> 00:04:07.643
- This will be your responsibility.
- Yes, sir.

00:04:07.727 --> 00:04:08.770
Ms. Song Ju-ran

00:04:08.853 --> 00:04:11.606
decided the female staff
needed an employee association

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:15.234
and persuaded Chairman Kang
to support the cause.

00:04:16.694 --> 00:04:17.653
{\an8}OUTSTANDING WOMAN
KIM I-GYEONG

00:04:17.737 --> 00:04:18.738
{\an8}Congratulations.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.406
Please look over here.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.200
Each quarter,
a female employee is selected

00:04:22.283 --> 00:04:24.243
to be honored with a plaque
and a cash prize.

00:04:24.327 --> 00:04:27.538
It actively promotes inclusion and morale
among the female staff.

00:04:32.835 --> 00:04:33.795
This quarter,

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.797
you'd be a prime candidate.

00:04:36.381 --> 00:04:37.924
You prevented that order error too.

00:04:38.841 --> 00:04:40.259
No, I don't think so.

00:04:40.843 --> 00:04:41.761
Come on now.

00:04:42.345 --> 00:04:43.721
I hope it's you.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.307
Well, that would be nice.

{\an8}HONG CHUN-SEOP, FATHER
KIM SOON-JUNG, MOTHER

00:05:03.825 --> 00:05:05.785
Hong Jang-mi is an only child.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.039
I think that explains
why she has no manners.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:11.916
May I ask

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:16.796
why you have taken
such an interest in Hong Jang-mi?

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:19.966
The president also asked about her before.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.885
President Shin did? When?

00:05:24.178 --> 00:05:27.306
It was around the time she was involved
in the trading order incident.

00:05:28.891 --> 00:05:29.976
I see.

00:05:31.602 --> 00:05:34.480
I'm just checking some things
for the Outstanding Woman selection,

00:05:34.564 --> 00:05:35.982
that's all.

00:05:36.983 --> 00:05:38.568
- You may leave.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.337
The Outstanding Women Employees' Club
was founded in 1993,

00:05:58.421 --> 00:05:59.839
after real-name banking was introduced.

00:06:00.423 --> 00:06:04.260
I secretly reviewed Ms. Song's
out-of-town business trip expense reports.

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:08.097
I'll fax it over, so please verify it
with the local financial institution.

00:06:31.829 --> 00:06:33.581
Those are the transaction details.

00:06:33.664 --> 00:06:36.709
Twelve billion won was deposited
to Kim I-gyeong at Songwi Branch

00:06:36.792 --> 00:06:38.711
and another 12 billion
was deposited to Go Bok-hee.

00:06:38.794 --> 00:06:42.632
As expected, the funds were spread across
three financial institutions in Chungseo.

00:06:42.715 --> 00:06:46.093
They moved accounts every quarter
to launder that money.

00:06:46.594 --> 00:06:47.637
But there's also this.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.848
Take a look.

00:06:52.475 --> 00:06:55.728
It turns out the body discovered
at the reservoir belonged to Kim I-gyeong.

00:06:56.354 --> 00:06:58.022
This is serious business.

00:06:59.398 --> 00:07:01.609
These bastards have
no respect for human life.

00:07:01.692 --> 00:07:04.028
No wonder Yehppee went into hiding.

00:07:04.111 --> 00:07:06.781
Something felt off,
so I looked into Onemillion's CEO as well.

00:07:07.365 --> 00:07:09.200
He disappeared and has gone missing.

00:07:10.451 --> 00:07:12.745
He could've left the country
or he might be in hiding.

00:07:12.828 --> 00:07:15.498
If we dig deeper, I'm sure we'll find
something like we did with the club.

00:07:17.667 --> 00:07:20.753
Song Ju-ran recently asked me
if I had an older sister.

00:07:20.836 --> 00:07:22.088
Boy, it sent chills down my spine.

00:07:22.171 --> 00:07:23.965
What? Were you caught?

00:07:24.048 --> 00:07:25.216
Then how are you here?

00:07:25.299 --> 00:07:28.094
I was saved by a visit
from Kang Nora's mother.

00:07:28.678 --> 00:07:29.887
I'll just have to deny it.

00:07:31.514 --> 00:07:34.100
I am Hong Jang-mi,
no matter what anyone says.

00:07:35.518 --> 00:07:36.394
Hong Jang-mi.

00:07:37.478 --> 00:07:41.857

EPISODE 6: THE SILENCE OF THE MISSES

00:07:47.405 --> 00:07:49.407
{\an8}OUTSTANDING WOMAN AWARD NOMINATION

00:07:50.866 --> 00:07:53.202
{\an8}REQUIREMENT:
RECOMMENDATION FROM DIVISION HEAD

00:07:54.912 --> 00:07:55.913
WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRINT?
YES

00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:02.837
Mr. Oh.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.006
Will you write me
a recommendation for the OW Award?

00:08:05.089 --> 00:08:06.424
Now.

00:08:12.513 --> 00:08:13.472
You need to write a reason.

00:08:15.641 --> 00:08:16.892
What should I write?

00:08:16.976 --> 00:08:17.810
"Recommendable"?

00:08:19.228 --> 00:08:21.814
"Ms. Hong Jang-mi is diligent."

00:08:21.897 --> 00:08:25.276
"She performs her duties with passion
and sets an example for others…"

00:08:27.236 --> 00:08:30.156
"Particularly, in September 1997,

00:08:30.239 --> 00:08:32.408
she identified an order error
made by Hanmin

00:08:32.491 --> 00:08:34.243
and swiftly resolved the issue."

00:08:34.327 --> 00:08:35.453
- "Thus, I strongly recommend her
- "Thus, I strongly recommend her

00:08:35.536 --> 00:08:37.038
- for the OW award."
- for the OW award."

00:08:40.499 --> 00:08:42.084
One's full of self-praise,

00:08:42.752 --> 00:08:44.128
and the other one's writing her legend.

00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:45.421
Going all out, aren't we?

00:08:45.504 --> 00:08:48.049
Intranet planning and development,
order-entry error remediation,

00:08:48.132 --> 00:08:49.592
and the trading system enhancement.

00:08:49.675 --> 00:08:51.802
I, Hong Jang-mi,
proved myself in all three instances.

00:08:52.386 --> 00:08:54.764
You should write all that down
and number them.

00:08:55.931 --> 00:08:56.766
"One…"

00:08:57.683 --> 00:08:59.852
"Intranet planning and development."

00:09:17.703 --> 00:09:19.955
You want an Outstanding Woman nomination?

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:22.375
For free?

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:25.878
How much do you want?

00:09:26.754 --> 00:09:28.673
I'm not interested in chump change.

00:09:29.256 --> 00:09:30.341
Besides,

00:09:31.175 --> 00:09:32.843
don't talk about money
in front of the kid.

00:09:32.927 --> 00:09:33.969
Let's keep it educational.

00:09:35.221 --> 00:09:36.138
Fine.

00:09:37.264 --> 00:09:38.140
Thank you.

00:09:46.482 --> 00:09:47.733
Let's dig in!

00:09:53.531 --> 00:09:54.365
Bom.

00:09:55.074 --> 00:09:57.201
Why aren't you eating
and just staring at Auntie Jang-mi?

00:09:57.284 --> 00:09:58.953
The director said we should start eating

00:09:59.036 --> 00:10:02.623
after the oldest one
at the table starts eating.

00:10:05.543 --> 00:10:06.544
The oldest…

00:10:10.131 --> 00:10:11.090
Queen Bee.

00:10:11.173 --> 00:10:13.467
The eldest should take the first bite.

00:10:14.385 --> 00:10:16.178
All right, let's eat.

00:10:17.138 --> 00:10:18.723
Eat up, Bom.

00:10:19.223 --> 00:10:20.057
Okay.

00:10:38.784 --> 00:10:40.661
HANMIN'S OUTSTANDING WOMEN EMPLOYEES

00:10:40.745 --> 00:10:42.413
She must really want to be on the list.

00:10:42.496 --> 00:10:44.165
She's treating this like it's a talisman.

00:10:47.835 --> 00:10:51.380
Will Hong Jang-mi become the 17th?

00:10:54.467 --> 00:10:55.384
Kim I-gyeong?

{\an8}OUTSTANDING WOMEN EMPLOYEES
= SLUSH FUND CUSTODIAN

00:11:13.068 --> 00:11:14.779
I was the 16th!

00:11:14.862 --> 00:11:16.864
There must be money in my account as well.

00:11:19.033 --> 00:11:20.493
I should check as soon as possible.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:30.794
Did you win the lottery?

00:11:31.629 --> 00:11:32.546
You scared me.

00:11:34.965 --> 00:11:36.091
Something like that.

00:11:37.301 --> 00:11:39.053
Fine. I'll do it.

00:11:42.306 --> 00:11:44.141
I'll nominate you.

00:11:53.651 --> 00:11:54.944
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

00:11:55.027 --> 00:11:57.112
Sales performance
across all business divisions

00:11:57.196 --> 00:11:59.198
has fallen by 30% compared to last year.

00:11:59.281 --> 00:12:03.118
I assume the challenging
global economic conditions

00:12:03.911 --> 00:12:05.371
and heightened equity risk

00:12:05.454 --> 00:12:07.206
- have investors pulling back--
- Listen.

00:12:08.165 --> 00:12:09.333
Back when I worked

00:12:10.626 --> 00:12:13.087
as a currency exchanger in Namdaemun,

00:12:13.963 --> 00:12:16.257
the shop next door
was a raw-fish restaurant.

00:12:17.508 --> 00:12:21.428
Some days, the fish prepared
in anticipation of demand went unsold,

00:12:21.512 --> 00:12:22.638
and they'd have leftovers.

00:12:23.222 --> 00:12:25.975
If they kept it in the fridge,

00:12:26.058 --> 00:12:28.477
they couldn't sell it raw the next day.

00:12:29.103 --> 00:12:30.062
But still,

00:12:30.646 --> 00:12:33.816
do you think the restaurant owner
just threw away perfectly good fish?

00:12:33.899 --> 00:12:35.818
No. Of course not.

00:12:36.527 --> 00:12:39.154
They would use that less-fresh fish

00:12:39.238 --> 00:12:41.031
to make spicy fish stew.

00:12:41.824 --> 00:12:44.410
Or they would pile on the chili powder

00:12:44.493 --> 00:12:46.370
to make a braised dish to sell.

00:12:46.453 --> 00:12:50.874
I'm saying, they sold it
one way or another to turn a profit.

00:12:52.167 --> 00:12:54.086
If they won't sell as individual stocks,

00:12:54.169 --> 00:12:56.005
get creative and try cooking with them.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:59.258
Put them out there as an equity fund.

00:12:59.341 --> 00:13:02.386
But Hanmin Asset Management
is in charge of equity funds.

00:13:02.469 --> 00:13:03.971
Do you want us Securities to pursue them?

00:13:04.054 --> 00:13:05.014
Come on now,

00:13:05.097 --> 00:13:08.309
all lucrative ventures belong to
Hanmin Investment & Securities.

00:13:08.892 --> 00:13:09.810
Even if

00:13:10.686 --> 00:13:12.521
I fail miserably

00:13:12.605 --> 00:13:14.565
and I'm forced to sell off
all our subsidiaries,

00:13:15.691 --> 00:13:18.402
Hanmin Investment & Securities
will remain standing.

00:13:18.986 --> 00:13:19.820
Sir.

00:13:20.738 --> 00:13:22.781
Wouldn't Research be
well-equipped to handle this,

00:13:22.865 --> 00:13:26.619
considering they specialize
in domestic and global economic data?

00:13:27.536 --> 00:13:29.163
General Manager Cha,

00:13:29.246 --> 00:13:31.957
your division does have
most of the overseas-trained, sharp minds.

00:13:32.708 --> 00:13:33.959
That's right, sir.

00:13:34.043 --> 00:13:35.878
We'll make it happen, no matter what.

00:13:38.255 --> 00:13:39.131
Albert.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:40.841
You too, you punk.

00:13:42.676 --> 00:13:44.887
Me? Me too?

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:48.140
Research and Risk Management,

00:13:48.974 --> 00:13:53.103
combine forces
to come up with a real gem of a product.

00:14:01.111 --> 00:14:04.657
Bang, you should take a backseat
on this task force.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.116
What do you mean?

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.827
Albert will remain unaffected
by your performance.

00:14:08.911 --> 00:14:11.413
But we're different.

00:14:11.497 --> 00:14:14.583
We need to prove our worth this time
if we want to survive.

00:14:14.667 --> 00:14:16.377
We do need to prove ourselves somehow

00:14:17.419 --> 00:14:19.171
to make up for the last incident.

00:14:20.547 --> 00:14:23.676
We'll have you serve
as an advisor on this,

00:14:23.759 --> 00:14:24.593
so don't worry.

00:14:28.847 --> 00:14:31.308
Just let me have the spotlight this time.

00:14:31.392 --> 00:14:32.726
I'll be sure to produce a winner.

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:34.603
I'm not doing this just for my livelihood.

00:14:35.604 --> 00:14:37.189
We all need to survive, man.

00:14:39.024 --> 00:14:40.109
Got it.

00:14:40.859 --> 00:14:42.194
You know what the chairman likes.

00:14:42.277 --> 00:14:45.447
He wants maximized profits and efficiency,
something that makes a lot of money.

00:15:04.633 --> 00:15:05.592
Ms. Hong.

00:15:06.468 --> 00:15:07.469
Where do you think you're sitting?

00:15:08.012 --> 00:15:09.596
Do you even know what a task force is?

00:15:11.682 --> 00:15:13.267
We need Ms. Hong.

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:15.060
Mr. Lee, do you want out too? Leave.

00:15:15.144 --> 00:15:16.812
No, don't leave.

00:15:16.895 --> 00:15:18.647
Since you're good with computers,
you can type.

00:15:18.731 --> 00:15:20.065
Take the meeting minutes.

00:15:21.358 --> 00:15:22.234
Ms. Hong.

00:15:23.318 --> 00:15:24.194
You know what to do.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:25.738
Do your job.

00:15:35.706 --> 00:15:36.874
Why that little…

00:15:36.957 --> 00:15:38.042
Jeez.

00:15:41.086 --> 00:15:44.131
Every project has a lead
and a supporting role.

00:15:44.214 --> 00:15:46.967
For this new fund product
development task force,

00:15:47.051 --> 00:15:48.677
Research will be leading,

00:15:48.761 --> 00:15:50.429
and Risk Management will be supporting.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.848
I hope that works for you.

00:15:53.432 --> 00:15:54.433
- Why--
- Okay!

00:15:56.685 --> 00:15:57.770
Okay.

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:08.864
It seems Hong Jang-mi

00:16:08.947 --> 00:16:11.366
used to attend beauty school
and now assists a celebrity stylist.

00:16:16.455 --> 00:16:17.539
The other photo

00:16:17.623 --> 00:16:20.667
{\an8}is a group shot with Hong Keum-bo
that was taken when she joined the FSS.

00:16:20.751 --> 00:16:21.960
Should I dig deeper?

00:16:22.044 --> 00:16:23.629
No, that's enough.

00:16:23.712 --> 00:16:24.755
Thank you.

00:16:50.864 --> 00:16:53.492
I really like steak.

00:16:54.201 --> 00:16:55.077
It's so good.

00:16:55.786 --> 00:16:57.287
I'm glad.

00:16:58.914 --> 00:17:02.751
Your employment at Hanmin
remains a secret, correct?

00:17:06.255 --> 00:17:07.756
My mom, dad,

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.467
Mr. Oh, Albert, and Ms. Song.

00:17:11.051 --> 00:17:12.177
Only these people know about it,

00:17:13.887 --> 00:17:14.888
but you were just added.

00:17:15.889 --> 00:17:19.226
To tell you the truth, I live in a dorm,
and not at my dad's place.

00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:20.978
That's why I can't get caught.

00:17:21.603 --> 00:17:22.938
The dorms…

00:17:23.772 --> 00:17:25.315
Ms. Go lives there as well, right?

00:17:26.191 --> 00:17:27.818
Along with Ms. Hong Jang-mi.

00:17:27.901 --> 00:17:30.362
We live in the same apartment.
We're roommates.

00:17:31.113 --> 00:17:32.030
Right.

00:17:33.949 --> 00:17:36.702
Have you ever tried
chicken skewers in Seoul?

00:17:38.287 --> 00:17:39.204
No.

00:17:41.206 --> 00:17:42.040
Are they tasty?

00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:44.459
Let's get some next time.

00:17:44.543 --> 00:17:46.628
I know of a good street vendor in Yeouido.

00:17:48.172 --> 00:17:49.089
Okay.

00:18:07.941 --> 00:18:10.068
I knew you'd make a cute couple.

00:18:12.487 --> 00:18:15.115
How does Christmas Eve
for the engagement sound?

00:18:15.199 --> 00:18:16.533
It would be so romantic.

00:18:19.036 --> 00:18:20.287
For that to happen…

00:18:24.416 --> 00:18:25.250
Nora.

00:18:25.918 --> 00:18:27.211
- That's enough steak for now.
- Wait…

00:18:28.045 --> 00:18:29.254
Let's try some salad.

00:18:30.839 --> 00:18:32.507
You'll need to fit in your wedding dress.

00:18:33.258 --> 00:18:34.134
Shall we clink?

00:18:36.178 --> 00:18:37.137
Not you.

00:18:37.638 --> 00:18:38.513
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:18:41.266 --> 00:18:42.226
Man, that's sweet.

00:18:46.021 --> 00:18:49.274
It feels a bit empty
eating all this with just you

00:18:49.358 --> 00:18:52.611
when Mr. Lee and Ms. Hong
are still back at the office.

00:18:53.445 --> 00:18:55.405
You almost sound believable.

00:18:55.906 --> 00:18:57.032
They're just too much.

00:18:57.115 --> 00:18:59.284
Why go out of their way
to find work for themselves?

00:19:03.413 --> 00:19:04.373
By the way,

00:19:05.457 --> 00:19:07.584
how did you ever manage to escape

00:19:08.126 --> 00:19:08.961
that infiltrator hunt?

00:19:11.463 --> 00:19:12.881
Why don't you ask your dad?

00:19:12.965 --> 00:19:14.049
Come on.

00:19:14.132 --> 00:19:15.717
I already did,

00:19:15.801 --> 00:19:18.387
but he refused to answer
and just got angry at me.

00:19:19.096 --> 00:19:21.890
He told you to come to his office
by noon that day,

00:19:21.974 --> 00:19:22.975
but you didn't show up.

00:19:23.058 --> 00:19:26.561
That's because I took
my concrete evidence somewhere else.

00:19:30.399 --> 00:19:31.483
Where?

00:19:35.445 --> 00:19:36.363
Look.

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:39.491
You've grown on me,
so let me give you a piece of advice.

00:19:41.243 --> 00:19:43.537
As long as Ms. Song Ju-ran is around,

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:46.915
you and Executive Director Oh
don't stand a chance.

00:19:51.211 --> 00:19:52.129
So if I want to move up,

00:19:52.212 --> 00:19:54.756
I need to be on her good side
and not my dad's?

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:55.716
Yeah.

00:20:00.804 --> 00:20:03.307

I put a lot of effort
into writing you all those letters,

00:20:49.186 --> 00:20:51.938
but seeing them all sent back
is starting to bother me.

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:56.985
Then someone told me they spotted you
near the Hanmin building in Yeouido.

00:20:57.652 --> 00:20:59.863
I'll be released at the end of November.

00:21:00.364 --> 00:21:01.365
See you then.

00:21:02.115 --> 00:21:05.118
And make a fat deposit
into my inmate fund before then.

00:21:11.124 --> 00:21:13.293
I came looking for treasure

00:21:13.377 --> 00:21:15.379
And it came to me

00:21:15.462 --> 00:21:17.130
That's my money. I earned that money!

00:21:17.214 --> 00:21:19.633
- Let go of me.
- Who do you think you are?

00:21:19.716 --> 00:21:21.593
Me? Your older brother.

00:21:23.011 --> 00:21:24.513
I'm just borrowing it.

00:21:24.596 --> 00:21:27.140

are going to help you?

Enjoying the show?

00:21:45.826 --> 00:21:47.536
Well? Are you going to help her?

00:21:47.619 --> 00:21:49.079

This year, an average of 40 companies
have gone bankrupt each day.

00:23:52.327 --> 00:23:54.204
With total bankruptcy expected
to top 20 trillion by the year-end…

00:23:54.287 --> 00:23:57.999
After months of barely hanging on
under severe financial strain,

00:23:58.083 --> 00:23:59.709
Hantae Group
finally declared bankruptcy today.

00:24:01.002 --> 00:24:04.256
Following today's announcement,
the government has settled on

00:24:04.339 --> 00:24:06.383
court receivership
and a third-party acquisition

00:24:06.466 --> 00:24:09.177
as its solution
to the Giheon Motors crisis.

00:24:09.803 --> 00:24:11.054
The government will convert

00:24:11.137 --> 00:24:14.808
320 billion won in loans
extended to Giheon Motors

00:24:14.891 --> 00:24:16.518
by the Korea Development Bank into equity…

00:24:48.216 --> 00:24:51.136
Now, shall we move on to the next one?

00:24:52.929 --> 00:24:53.805
So…

00:24:54.931 --> 00:24:56.266
What? What is it?

00:24:56.850 --> 00:24:58.518
The third line from the bottom of page two

00:24:58.601 --> 00:25:00.603
has Sedu Trading
listed under top holdings.

00:25:00.687 --> 00:25:03.815
Their second consecutive audit disclaimer
makes delisting imminent.

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:06.484
Where?

00:25:07.152 --> 00:25:08.862
Sedu… Oh this?

00:25:08.945 --> 00:25:10.196
That's just a typo.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:13.533
You're good at finding those.
Right, let's move on to the next page.

00:25:13.616 --> 00:25:15.327
And Ogyu Construction listed below that.

00:25:16.828 --> 00:25:18.121
They went bankrupt last week.

00:25:20.665 --> 00:25:22.542
I was just about to say that.

00:25:22.625 --> 00:25:24.461
You just told everyone to flip the page.

00:25:24.544 --> 00:25:25.962
That's enough from you.

00:25:26.504 --> 00:25:27.589
Know your damn place!

00:25:31.593 --> 00:25:32.427
Mr. Cha Jung-il.

00:25:36.639 --> 00:25:37.932
You're too loud.

00:25:43.063 --> 00:25:44.773
Sir, I meant no disrespect.

00:25:46.608 --> 00:25:47.442
I'll be more mindful.

00:25:52.322 --> 00:25:53.490
Done.

00:25:54.741 --> 00:25:55.867
Big Al.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:57.202
Salute!

00:26:02.457 --> 00:26:04.042
- Amazing.
- Here you go, Mr. Oh.

00:26:04.125 --> 00:26:05.418
{\an8}RESERVED

00:26:05.502 --> 00:26:06.669
Let's drink.

00:26:09.506 --> 00:26:10.548
Man, that's bitter.

00:26:11.716 --> 00:26:14.094
That man is a ball
of disrespect and typos.

00:26:14.761 --> 00:26:16.054
You saw how he caved

00:26:16.137 --> 00:26:18.390
when Albert, his very much junior,
said something.

00:26:18.473 --> 00:26:19.307
It's delicious.

00:26:19.391 --> 00:26:21.101
He's a real piece of work.

00:26:21.184 --> 00:26:22.227
Exactly.

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:24.229
Still, I've never seen Big Al
do that before.

00:26:24.312 --> 00:26:25.688
I think he was really angry.

00:26:26.648 --> 00:26:29.275
But they're all buddy-buddy now,
having a blast.

00:26:32.654 --> 00:26:33.738
{\an8}Mr. Lee.

00:26:33.822 --> 00:26:36.699
Should restaurants sell
food that has gone bad, or not?

00:26:36.783 --> 00:26:37.742
They should not.

00:26:37.826 --> 00:26:39.202
Should a securities firm sell a fund

00:26:39.285 --> 00:26:43.415
made up only of struggling companies
that could go bankrupt any day, or not?

00:26:43.498 --> 00:26:44.874
They should not.

00:26:44.958 --> 00:26:46.334
That's my point.

00:26:46.418 --> 00:26:49.504
We should help fill people's pockets,
not bleed them dry.

00:26:53.675 --> 00:26:54.926
It's not like I can lead the charge.

00:26:56.553 --> 00:26:58.513
It'd be better
if we made it ourselves, right?

00:26:59.722 --> 00:27:00.765
The two of us?

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:04.394
If it's with you,
I'm willing to do anything,

00:27:04.477 --> 00:27:06.521
- whenever…
- What's with the reserved table here?

00:27:08.773 --> 00:27:09.607
I heard a VIP is coming.

00:27:10.817 --> 00:27:11.651
A VIP?

00:27:11.734 --> 00:27:12.569
Hello?

00:27:13.611 --> 00:27:15.405
Have you arrived? Yes, sir.

00:27:15.488 --> 00:27:16.573
Oh, he's here?

00:27:18.116 --> 00:27:18.992
{\an8}Yes.

00:27:19.075 --> 00:27:20.743
{\an8}Please come in, sir.

00:27:32.464 --> 00:27:34.674
- Thank you for all your hard work.
- Thank you, sir.

00:27:36.843 --> 00:27:38.178
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you.

00:27:38.887 --> 00:27:39.929
Thanks for your hard work.

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:55.612
Please take a seat.

00:27:55.695 --> 00:27:56.529
Yes, sir.

00:28:04.412 --> 00:28:06.414
Ms. Hong, that damn brat.

00:28:06.498 --> 00:28:07.582
At least she's consistent.

00:28:16.049 --> 00:28:19.177
Your tireless efforts
in the new product development

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:20.386
are very much appreciated.

00:28:21.513 --> 00:28:24.682
I must say I'm pleased
to be working again with such capable

00:28:24.766 --> 00:28:25.975
and irreplaceable talent.

00:28:26.476 --> 00:28:27.685
Let's cheers to that.

00:28:27.769 --> 00:28:29.646
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

00:28:41.658 --> 00:28:42.575
Ms. Hong.

00:28:44.202 --> 00:28:46.621
Grab us some cigarettes
and popsicles from the supermarket.

00:28:50.166 --> 00:28:51.000
Help yourself, sir.

00:28:51.084 --> 00:28:53.711
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

00:29:00.301 --> 00:29:02.220
- Sir?
- Sure. Thank you.

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.139
My goodness, thank you for joining us.

00:29:07.725 --> 00:29:08.810
Allow me.

00:29:08.893 --> 00:29:10.103
Really?

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:12.438
Thank you, sir.

00:29:21.489 --> 00:29:23.741
Is he doing that on purpose
to mess with me?

00:29:23.825 --> 00:29:25.034
Does he know it's me?

00:29:27.912 --> 00:29:28.788
I do.

00:29:35.211 --> 00:29:36.379
Time to be shameless.

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:39.799
Sir, would you like to choose one?

00:29:42.093 --> 00:29:45.054
Were you the one who sent in
that anonymous tip about Mr. So,

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.806
Ms. Hong Jang-mi?

00:29:48.766 --> 00:29:50.894
You secured a three-billion-won
cancellation agreement

00:29:50.977 --> 00:29:53.229
from Onemillion's CEO,
fresh off a stock-rigging windfall.

00:29:54.814 --> 00:29:57.150
Hong Jang-mi,
the 20-year-old entry-level employee,

00:29:57.817 --> 00:30:00.028
couldn't have easily pulled off
such feats on her own.

00:30:01.321 --> 00:30:02.864
But still, I got it done.

00:30:03.364 --> 00:30:04.616
You made me do it.

00:30:05.658 --> 00:30:07.827
Because I wanted you to leave quietly.

00:30:08.411 --> 00:30:10.121
But you managed to survive.

00:30:10.204 --> 00:30:13.833
Don't you realize
that only makes you more suspicious?

00:30:13.917 --> 00:30:14.834
Or are you

00:30:14.918 --> 00:30:16.628
just playing dumb?

00:30:16.711 --> 00:30:18.463
There you are, Ms. Hong.

00:30:20.757 --> 00:30:22.300
You haven't answered me yet.

00:30:23.301 --> 00:30:24.177
I don't know.

00:30:25.762 --> 00:30:27.639
It's almost curfew time at the dorms,

00:30:27.722 --> 00:30:28.723
so I'll be off now.

00:30:35.021 --> 00:30:36.314
Ms. Hong!

00:30:36.397 --> 00:30:38.858
Shin Jung-woo,
you grew up to become an evil man.

00:30:39.359 --> 00:30:41.653
Don't look back and don't lock eyes.

00:30:41.736 --> 00:30:43.404
Remember, you're Hong Jang-mi.

00:30:43.905 --> 00:30:46.240
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

00:30:47.533 --> 00:30:49.369
About the cash
from Kim I-gyeong's account…

00:30:50.495 --> 00:30:52.205
Deposit it into
Go Bok-hee's account for now,

00:30:52.705 --> 00:30:54.457
until the new account is ready.

00:30:55.625 --> 00:30:56.459
Thanks.

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:05.176
RISK MANAGEMENT DIVISION

00:31:06.469 --> 00:31:07.512
Is it the HR announcement board?

00:31:08.054 --> 00:31:09.180
Yes.

00:31:09.263 --> 00:31:10.348
An employee passed away.

00:31:10.431 --> 00:31:11.975
{\an8}OBITUARY
NAME: KIM I-GYEONG

00:31:12.058 --> 00:31:14.227
She must've been young
if she was at a branch.

00:31:14.852 --> 00:31:15.687
What a shame.

00:31:19.232 --> 00:31:21.025
OBITUARY
NAME: KIM I-GYEONG

00:31:30.952 --> 00:31:32.412
{\an8}OBITUARY
NAME: KIM I-GYEONG

00:31:32.495 --> 00:31:34.330
{\an8}WE REGRET TO ANNOUNCE THE PASSING
OF MS. KIM I-GYEONG AT SONGWI BRANCH

00:31:34.414 --> 00:31:35.707
{\an8}DATE OF PASSING: OCTOBER 22, 1997

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:36.916
Kim I-gyeong?

00:31:49.178 --> 00:31:51.764
DOMESTIC SLUSH FUND CUSTODIANS

00:31:51.848 --> 00:31:53.725
SONGWI BRANCH, KIM I-GYEONG

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.158
Jang-mi.

00:32:11.117 --> 00:32:11.951
Are you asleep?

00:32:13.786 --> 00:32:16.039
Don't use a sweet tone with me like that.

00:32:16.122 --> 00:32:17.373
It's scary.

00:32:21.002 --> 00:32:22.920
If, by any chance,

00:32:23.463 --> 00:32:26.090
you come across money
that falls out of the sky, leave it.

00:32:26.674 --> 00:32:27.633
Just walk away, okay?

00:32:30.261 --> 00:32:31.888
Worry about yourself.

00:32:32.472 --> 00:32:33.473
What did I do?

00:32:34.766 --> 00:32:37.268
I give you words of wisdom,
yet you'll refuse to listen.

00:32:41.856 --> 00:32:45.693
If only I'd grown up in a normal family
like the ones you see on TV…

00:32:47.612 --> 00:32:48.988
If only I'd gone to college…

00:32:50.114 --> 00:32:51.616
If only I worked for a company

00:32:51.699 --> 00:32:54.327
where people addressed me by my full name…

00:32:56.079 --> 00:32:57.538
I would've led an ordinary life.

00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:00.666
I wouldn't wish for much more.

00:33:06.047 --> 00:33:07.757
It's still not too late for you.

00:33:08.633 --> 00:33:10.051
Go to college while you can.

00:33:37.954 --> 00:33:40.706
Risk Management submitted
a separate proposal

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:42.083
for a new fund product.

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:43.876
Mr. Oh.

00:33:44.585 --> 00:33:45.628
What's the objective?

00:34:09.443 --> 00:34:12.572
We adjusted the portfolio
to prioritize investment risk management.

00:34:13.072 --> 00:34:15.199
Then the expected return would be too low.

00:34:15.283 --> 00:34:16.325
How low are we talking?

00:34:20.163 --> 00:34:22.331
It was set conservatively,

00:34:23.207 --> 00:34:24.750
given domestic
and global economic concerns.

00:34:24.834 --> 00:34:27.503
Was this proposal discussed with Research?

00:34:27.587 --> 00:34:28.796
Not at all.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.215
We've already taken those factors
into account, of course.

00:34:37.722 --> 00:34:38.681
Ms. Hong Jang-mi.

00:34:39.807 --> 00:34:41.934
Don't feed your words to another,

00:34:42.018 --> 00:34:43.644
and speak for yourself.

00:34:47.982 --> 00:34:51.152
All the points I wanted to make
are reflected in the improvement proposal.

00:34:52.445 --> 00:34:55.823
Bundling together junk stocks
with credit ratings of C or D

00:34:55.907 --> 00:34:57.200
is a form of client deception.

00:34:59.076 --> 00:35:00.786
Without risk, there's no return.

00:35:03.039 --> 00:35:05.291
The Research Division
will continue to take the lead.

00:35:05.374 --> 00:35:06.500
Yes, sir.

00:35:11.589 --> 00:35:14.091
Worry about your own risks.

00:35:22.391 --> 00:35:23.226
Good job.

00:35:25.394 --> 00:35:26.354
Well done.

00:35:36.656 --> 00:35:39.033
BREAK ROOM

00:35:42.578 --> 00:35:43.579
That report…

00:35:44.413 --> 00:35:45.498
Did you write it?

00:35:45.581 --> 00:35:46.874
No.

00:35:46.958 --> 00:35:47.833
Ms. Hong did.

00:35:50.711 --> 00:35:53.005
How does she manage to produce
assistant-manager-level…

00:35:53.547 --> 00:35:56.717
No, manager-level quality work
every damn time?

00:35:59.178 --> 00:36:00.054
She's smart.

00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:07.186
Too smart, in fact.

00:36:11.023 --> 00:36:11.941
Where's Bok-hee?

00:36:12.608 --> 00:36:13.442
Queen Bee?

00:36:13.526 --> 00:36:16.237
She said she's going to Chungseo tonight
for a business trip.

00:36:16.737 --> 00:36:18.406
She has some important business tomorrow.

00:36:19.448 --> 00:36:20.700
Chungseo?

00:36:22.785 --> 00:36:24.328
Is she accompanying the president?

00:36:25.037 --> 00:36:25.871
No.

00:36:25.955 --> 00:36:27.623
She said
she's taking the train by herself.

00:36:29.792 --> 00:36:30.626
Damn it.

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:32.253
Wait.

00:36:37.008 --> 00:36:38.551
Seriously, Go Bok-hee?

00:36:38.634 --> 00:36:40.553
That money is nothing but trouble.

00:36:57.111 --> 00:36:58.279
Sir, I'm in a rush.

00:36:58.362 --> 00:36:59.405
Go Bok-hee, the Queen Bee…

00:36:59.905 --> 00:37:01.991
I need to find your assistant
to ask her something.

00:37:02.074 --> 00:37:03.951
Ms. Go just left for the day.

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:05.661
Damn it.

00:37:06.537 --> 00:37:08.622
I need to hear the answer
I never got back then.

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:11.667
Why has Hong Keum-bo
lied to plant herself in Hanmin?

00:37:15.338 --> 00:37:17.673
Can you try to make a little more sense?

00:37:18.257 --> 00:37:20.551
Why do you keep asking me about my sister?

00:37:22.553 --> 00:37:23.387
EMERGENCY STOP

00:37:26.057 --> 00:37:27.683
I asked you first.

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.478
What are you doing here?

00:37:35.858 --> 00:37:37.485
It sounds like you already know.

00:37:42.114 --> 00:37:43.991
OUT OF SERVICE

00:37:44.075 --> 00:37:46.827
Big Al, maybe we should take
another elevator.

00:37:46.911 --> 00:37:48.287
I can't help but wonder.

00:37:48.371 --> 00:37:49.622
Who's trapped in there?

00:37:51.624 --> 00:37:52.833
If they're alone, it's horror.

00:37:54.251 --> 00:37:55.503
If there are two, it's romance.

00:37:56.003 --> 00:37:57.755
- If there are three…
- Oxygen deprivation.

00:37:58.214 --> 00:37:59.465
Where did Ms. Hong go?

00:38:00.174 --> 00:38:01.258
I saw her bag at her desk.

00:38:02.051 --> 00:38:03.886
She's slacking off already,

00:38:03.969 --> 00:38:06.055
leaving her desk during business hours.

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:08.766
Call her.

00:38:08.849 --> 00:38:09.725
All right.

00:38:35.251 --> 00:38:36.752
Why did you sneak into Hanmin?

00:38:37.378 --> 00:38:38.712
Didn't you think I'd kick you out?

00:38:40.005 --> 00:38:41.090
I did,

00:38:41.173 --> 00:38:44.176
but you already failed once.

00:38:49.974 --> 00:38:51.767
I'll let my sister know you said hello,

00:38:51.851 --> 00:38:53.310
though I doubt she'll be thrilled.

00:38:57.189 --> 00:38:58.274
The elevator is fine.

00:39:02.194 --> 00:39:03.362
Hello, sir.

00:39:17.793 --> 00:39:19.211
Bok-hee.

00:39:25.176 --> 00:39:26.343
It's been a while.

00:39:27.386 --> 00:39:28.220
How…

00:39:29.096 --> 00:39:30.264
How are you out so soon?

00:39:30.347 --> 00:39:33.684
Your brother got released early
for good behavior.

00:39:35.853 --> 00:39:37.771
You don't seem too thrilled about that.

00:39:40.524 --> 00:39:41.609
Did you not get my letters?

00:39:43.486 --> 00:39:44.737
I told you I'd find you.

00:39:49.116 --> 00:39:51.619
You must've forgotten about my temper,
haven't you?

00:39:54.413 --> 00:39:55.873
Damn it. I ought to just…

00:40:05.758 --> 00:40:07.551
How dare you try to hit a woman!

00:40:09.845 --> 00:40:10.888
Who the hell are you?

00:40:22.066 --> 00:40:22.900
What the hell?

00:40:24.902 --> 00:40:26.403
Come on, bro.

00:40:26.487 --> 00:40:29.365
Let's just do as I say.

00:40:29.448 --> 00:40:30.449
Bok-hee.

00:40:31.075 --> 00:40:32.159
I'll be back.

00:40:34.119 --> 00:40:35.788
- You lucked out today.
- Why you…

00:41:02.398 --> 00:41:03.607
Hi, Mommy!

00:41:03.691 --> 00:41:05.150
Hi, Mommy!

00:41:05.234 --> 00:41:06.694
- Hi, Mommy!
- Hi, Mommy!

00:41:06.777 --> 00:41:08.862
- Hi!
- Let's try this one.

00:41:20.082 --> 00:41:21.542
We're home now, so talk.

00:41:21.625 --> 00:41:23.335
Who was that crazy bastard earlier?

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:27.131
Your boyfriend?

00:41:27.214 --> 00:41:28.090
No!

00:41:29.341 --> 00:41:30.593
He's my brother.

00:41:30.676 --> 00:41:31.552
My older brother.

00:41:33.679 --> 00:41:36.307
How is he out already?
His release was set for late November.

00:41:37.725 --> 00:41:38.892
Release?

00:41:39.727 --> 00:41:40.644
Release?

00:41:40.728 --> 00:41:42.104
Prison!

00:41:44.982 --> 00:41:46.358
Oh my god.

00:41:46.442 --> 00:41:48.152
The letter you dropped in the locker room,

00:41:48.736 --> 00:41:49.612
from Ahnhyang Correctional Institution.

00:42:01.832 --> 00:42:03.250
SENDER: GO BOK-CHEOL
AHNHYANG CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION

00:42:05.502 --> 00:42:08.714
Why would I still be here at my age,
living in the dorms with you all

00:42:09.214 --> 00:42:11.550
if I had normal parents
or siblings with stable jobs?

00:42:12.926 --> 00:42:15.220
I'm sick and tired of this life too!

00:42:16.972 --> 00:42:19.892
I don't want to spend my life
being drained by a leech.

00:42:24.563 --> 00:42:27.900
Was she trying to make a quick score
and run before her brother's release?

00:42:29.443 --> 00:42:31.487
I need to withdraw it all
before they announce

00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:32.863
the Outstanding Woman next week.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:36.283
I have a train to catch.

00:42:36.367 --> 00:42:37.451
I need to go.

00:42:38.869 --> 00:42:40.120
Let go. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:43:21.328 --> 00:43:22.955
I asked you first.

00:43:24.331 --> 00:43:25.749
What are you doing here?

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:28.335
It sounds like you already know.

00:43:31.672 --> 00:43:33.132
I should've held back.

00:43:34.425 --> 00:43:36.135
I should've just ignored it.

00:43:37.261 --> 00:43:38.345
I never asked you for help.

00:43:51.984 --> 00:43:53.694
I wasn't talking about you.

00:43:53.777 --> 00:43:55.612
You regret helping me earlier.

00:43:55.696 --> 00:43:57.197
You're scared of his criminal record!

00:43:59.408 --> 00:44:01.994
I couldn't care less about that right now.

00:44:05.289 --> 00:44:08.125
That bastard will
eventually track down this dorm.

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:12.921
I've been all over the country
trying to get away from him.

00:44:22.014 --> 00:44:22.848
What are you…

00:44:39.865 --> 00:44:42.034
I'll write a recommendation
for my replacement.

00:44:42.826 --> 00:44:43.952
Who?

00:44:44.453 --> 00:44:45.537
You. Hong Jang-mi.

00:44:46.288 --> 00:44:48.373
No thanks. What's wrong with you?

00:44:50.584 --> 00:44:52.419
Why are you packing?
You're not going anywhere.

00:44:52.503 --> 00:44:54.213
- Take it all out.
- Stop it.

00:44:54.296 --> 00:44:55.380
Where would you even go?

00:45:01.261 --> 00:45:02.721
He was over 180 cm tall,

00:45:02.804 --> 00:45:04.932
and he had thick hair
with sharp-looking eyes.

00:45:05.015 --> 00:45:06.892
He was also wearing a trench coat.

00:45:06.975 --> 00:45:10.521
If we see a man matching that description
suspiciously lurking around the dorms,

00:45:10.604 --> 00:45:11.730
let's take him down immediately.

00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:23.700
Where are you going?

00:45:26.954 --> 00:45:28.080
To work.

00:45:28.163 --> 00:45:29.831
This isn't a midnight run, okay?

00:45:31.291 --> 00:45:32.459
Bok-hee, wait.

00:45:36.922 --> 00:45:39.383
This is pepper spray for self-defense,

00:45:39.466 --> 00:45:41.051
and this is your lunch.

00:45:41.552 --> 00:45:43.512
Eat your lunch in the office for now.

00:45:49.768 --> 00:45:50.602
Bok-hee,

00:45:50.686 --> 00:45:52.020
I'm always praying for you.

00:45:52.938 --> 00:45:55.691
My mommy prays every day.

00:46:02.072 --> 00:46:03.448
I don't need any prayers.

00:46:06.076 --> 00:46:06.910
Thanks anyway.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.710
I'm not feeling the cafeteria today.

00:46:14.793 --> 00:46:16.003
I want to eat out.

00:46:16.712 --> 00:46:17.546
Let's go.

00:46:17.629 --> 00:46:19.798
What about that place out front?

00:47:36.708 --> 00:47:39.169
{\an8}LETTER OF RESIGNATION

00:47:48.762 --> 00:47:51.139
You've reached Hanmin's Admin Office.

00:47:51.223 --> 00:47:53.100
Hey, you asked me last time

00:47:53.183 --> 00:47:55.060
about Hong Jang-mi
from Jemulpo Girls' Commercial High.

00:47:55.143 --> 00:47:56.144
Well, I looked into her.

00:47:57.187 --> 00:47:58.021
You did?

00:47:59.564 --> 00:48:01.191
{\an8}JEMULPO GIRLS' COMMERCIAL HIGH SCHOOL

00:48:09.658 --> 00:48:11.284
Apparently she was a total delinquent.

00:48:11.368 --> 00:48:12.953
She was a notorious brawler.

00:48:13.036 --> 00:48:13.954
Hey.

00:48:14.579 --> 00:48:16.123
Don't you know who I am?

00:48:16.206 --> 00:48:17.124
Shut the hell up.

00:48:23.422 --> 00:48:26.633
She became top dog
as soon as she enrolled,

00:48:26.717 --> 00:48:29.010
and she led the charge
whenever they fought other schools.

00:48:44.443 --> 00:48:46.737
How did such a delinquent
even submit employment paperwork?

00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:48.780
She has a sister
who's a lot older than her.

00:48:49.281 --> 00:48:51.867
I heard she tried to force her
into a junior college, but failed.

00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:53.160
She has a sister?

00:48:53.243 --> 00:48:56.121
And her parents run
a fried chicken place in Jemulpo.

00:48:56.204 --> 00:48:57.748
I think it was called Ullala Chicken.

00:48:58.248 --> 00:48:59.332
All right, thanks.

00:49:37.579 --> 00:49:38.413
What is it?

00:49:39.289 --> 00:49:40.415
It's weird.

00:49:42.417 --> 00:49:45.629
It's after hours,
so I can put my head down.

00:49:45.712 --> 00:49:47.005
All of you slack off all the time.

00:49:47.088 --> 00:49:47.923
Not that.

00:49:49.466 --> 00:49:51.384
The new fund product development
task force.

00:49:52.636 --> 00:49:53.970
I couldn't care less about it.

00:49:54.846 --> 00:49:57.390
The chairman forced it on me,

00:49:57.474 --> 00:50:00.977
and I was just going to go along
with whatever Research decided.

00:50:03.563 --> 00:50:06.817
But seeing you get scolded
and our proposal get shot down,

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:08.109
I feel…

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:11.279
upset.

00:50:15.325 --> 00:50:16.660
Because you're the leader,

00:50:16.743 --> 00:50:18.870
and we're on the same team.

00:50:18.954 --> 00:50:20.163
We're one team.

00:50:20.747 --> 00:50:21.706
Because you're the leader.

00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:26.002
We're one team.

00:50:31.258 --> 00:50:32.509
I heard The Contact,

00:50:32.592 --> 00:50:34.886
a romance movie with Han Suk-kyu
and Jeon Do-yeon, is a hit.

00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:35.804
Have you seen it?

00:50:37.222 --> 00:50:39.850
What does that movie
have to do with the fund?

00:50:39.933 --> 00:50:40.767
I'm…

00:50:42.602 --> 00:50:43.854
asking you out on a date.

00:50:46.857 --> 00:50:47.983
Do you want to see it with me?

00:50:49.442 --> 00:50:50.652
Tomorrow, Saturday night.

00:50:51.403 --> 00:50:52.529
At seven o'clock.

00:50:59.035 --> 00:51:01.705
There's quite an age gap between us.

00:51:03.164 --> 00:51:04.165
Is twenty

00:51:05.166 --> 00:51:07.127
and twenty-five too big a gap?

00:51:09.588 --> 00:51:10.672
It's inappropriate.

00:51:10.755 --> 00:51:13.425
I mean, it just feels wrong.

00:51:13.508 --> 00:51:16.428
While I was downing makgeolli
by the bowl in college,

00:51:16.511 --> 00:51:19.598
Albert was in elementary school,
learning kids' stuff,

00:51:20.223 --> 00:51:22.017
probably drawing in his journal and stuff.

00:51:23.018 --> 00:51:24.603
This is too much.

00:51:24.686 --> 00:51:25.896
Oh gosh.

00:51:26.479 --> 00:51:27.606
Jeez.

00:51:28.231 --> 00:51:29.983
You seem to be enjoying yourself.

00:51:31.234 --> 00:51:32.611
It's just absurd.

00:51:33.194 --> 00:51:35.530
He's ten years younger than me.
He's a kid.

00:51:36.114 --> 00:51:38.450
To Albert, you are Hong Jang-mi,

00:51:38.533 --> 00:51:41.244
and he probably thinks
he was rejected by a 20-year-old.

00:51:42.621 --> 00:51:45.040
The more I think about it,
the angrier I get.

00:51:45.123 --> 00:51:48.293
I mean, if he asked you out,
you should've just said yes.

00:51:48.376 --> 00:51:49.461
You could set a honey trap

00:51:49.544 --> 00:51:51.922
to dig up some first-rate intel
about the Kang family.

00:51:52.005 --> 00:51:53.882
How could you just toss away that chance?

00:51:53.965 --> 00:51:56.718
Do I look like Mata Hari?
Why would I weaponize my beauty?

00:51:56.801 --> 00:51:57.677
What?

00:51:57.761 --> 00:52:00.889
It's much better to be a pretty spy
than just a regular spy.

00:52:00.972 --> 00:52:02.807
Others would kill to be one.

00:52:03.308 --> 00:52:04.351
Don't forget.

00:52:04.434 --> 00:52:08.188
When you stand in front of
Shin Jung-woo or Albert Oh,

00:52:08.271 --> 00:52:09.397
you're Hong Jang-mi.

00:52:09.481 --> 00:52:11.900
The beautiful 20-year-old.

00:52:18.114 --> 00:52:20.909
Jeez, I was really hoping to avoid
setting a honey trap.

00:52:22.911 --> 00:52:24.829
That's the fate of a beautiful woman.

00:52:38.843 --> 00:52:40.929
Saturday morning duties are done.
It's time to go home.

00:52:43.306 --> 00:52:44.891
It was seven o'clock, right?

00:52:44.975 --> 00:52:46.768
At the Piccadilly Theater at Jongno 3-ga?

00:52:48.895 --> 00:52:50.355
Yes, seven is when it starts.

00:52:51.856 --> 00:52:54.567
Then I'll see you at the cafe
in front of the theater at 6:40.

00:53:25.015 --> 00:53:26.599
LONG PALE YELLOW DRESS, FLATS

00:53:42.115 --> 00:53:43.616
He was over 180 cm tall,

00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:45.827
and he had thick hair
with sharp-looking eyes.

00:53:46.411 --> 00:53:47.996
{\an8}He was wearing a trench coat.

00:53:48.079 --> 00:53:51.624
If you see a man matching that description
suspiciously lurking around the dorms,

00:53:51.708 --> 00:53:52.959
let's take him down immediately.

00:53:57.922 --> 00:54:00.800
So this is the dorm where
Hong Keum-bo is living as Hong Jang-mi.

00:54:03.762 --> 00:54:07.057
Why in the world
is she going to such great lengths?

00:54:25.075 --> 00:54:26.826
Jang-mi, do you have a date?

00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:29.204
I guess you really are seeing somebody.

00:54:34.542 --> 00:54:36.377
You look like a princess.

00:54:48.973 --> 00:54:49.974
Hey, you're back.

00:54:52.018 --> 00:54:54.479
Over 180 cm tall,
with thick hair and sharp-looking eyes.

00:54:54.562 --> 00:54:56.022
He matches the description perfectly.

00:54:56.606 --> 00:54:57.607
Should we call the police?

00:55:00.652 --> 00:55:02.695
Queen Bee, lock the door
and stay here with the kid.

00:55:02.779 --> 00:55:05.740
And you two,
get the RA and the security guard.

00:55:06.241 --> 00:55:07.242
Okay. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:14.791
Bom, stay here with Auntie Bok-hee, okay?

00:55:15.542 --> 00:55:16.584
Jang-mi!

00:55:40.692 --> 00:55:41.568
Mr. Go Bok-cheol?

00:55:44.404 --> 00:55:45.238
What the…

00:55:46.322 --> 00:55:47.240
You…

00:55:47.782 --> 00:55:48.825
have become quite savage.

00:55:48.908 --> 00:55:50.577
- What are you doing?
- Over there!

00:55:51.411 --> 00:55:52.370
How dare you!

00:55:52.453 --> 00:55:53.872
Stop right there!

00:55:53.955 --> 00:55:55.790
You bastard.

00:55:55.874 --> 00:55:57.000
How dare you!

00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:58.710
What the…

00:56:00.253 --> 00:56:01.296
Ms. Kim, stop.

00:56:01.379 --> 00:56:03.339
He's not the bad guy!

00:56:03.423 --> 00:56:04.799
Then who is he?

00:56:17.770 --> 00:56:18.771
Oh no. Are you okay?

00:56:18.855 --> 00:56:19.939
I mean, are you okay, sir?

00:56:25.445 --> 00:56:26.571
Water…

00:56:26.654 --> 00:56:27.864
Damn it.

00:56:36.414 --> 00:56:37.248
Ms. Hong.

00:56:38.208 --> 00:56:39.042
Ms. Hong.

00:57:08.363 --> 00:57:10.365
Ms. Hong Jang-mi, explain yourself.

00:57:11.282 --> 00:57:14.327
I heard a violent, abusive member
of Go Bok-hee's family was here.

00:57:14.911 --> 00:57:16.579
And now, he's not him?

00:57:16.663 --> 00:57:18.998
Who in the world
is this unidentified male?

00:57:20.541 --> 00:57:23.044
Well, you see, he is…

00:57:29.217 --> 00:57:31.970
No, please, let me explain.

00:57:42.522 --> 00:57:45.233
"Hanmin Investment & Securities,
President Shin Jung-woo."

00:57:45.316 --> 00:57:46.234
President?

00:57:46.317 --> 00:57:47.318
The president?

00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:57.036
President Shin?

00:58:04.419 --> 00:58:05.878
Did he come to see

00:58:05.962 --> 00:58:08.381
Kang Nora in secret,
only to get dragged into this mess?

00:58:08.881 --> 00:58:10.383
I'm so sorry, sir.

00:58:10.967 --> 00:58:13.636
I completely forgot to fax
that document you asked for.

00:58:14.137 --> 00:58:16.848
Please accept my sincerest apology.

00:58:17.765 --> 00:58:19.767
Yes, sure. Well…

00:58:23.896 --> 00:58:26.566
My apologies for the misunderstanding
and the collar grabbing.

00:58:27.066 --> 00:58:30.320
Please understand it was necessary
for the safety of my residents.

00:58:31.237 --> 00:58:32.071
It's all right.

00:58:32.155 --> 00:58:33.364
I should apologize.

00:58:33.448 --> 00:58:34.907
Let's go, sir.

00:58:35.408 --> 00:58:36.451
You three, disperse.

00:58:36.534 --> 00:58:37.994
Jang-mi, you go on your date.

00:58:47.462 --> 00:58:48.338
What are you looking at?

00:58:49.881 --> 00:58:50.757
I can take that.

00:58:51.633 --> 00:58:52.592
This way.

00:59:02.518 --> 00:59:04.062
Ms. Go, the truth is--

00:59:04.145 --> 00:59:04.979
Taxi!

00:59:07.023 --> 00:59:08.608
I'll make sure they stay quiet.

00:59:09.233 --> 00:59:10.610
- What…
- Here you go.

00:59:10.693 --> 00:59:11.611
Wait.

00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:15.198
Okay then.

00:59:33.966 --> 00:59:34.801
Queen Bee.

00:59:34.884 --> 00:59:36.469
That was a lie before, right?

00:59:36.552 --> 00:59:40.431
What kind of president comes to
his assistant's dorm to pick up a file?

00:59:41.224 --> 00:59:42.767
Could he have been here to see me?

00:59:43.267 --> 00:59:44.936
Maybe he likes me?

00:59:46.270 --> 00:59:48.356
I just left the worst impression
on the president.

00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:51.067
I'm never going to be full-time now, am I?

00:59:51.734 --> 00:59:52.652
Was someone here?

00:59:55.279 --> 00:59:56.531
Don't be curious,

00:59:57.323 --> 00:59:58.533
and don't be concerned.

00:59:58.616 --> 01:00:02.370
Why? Because tonight, no one was here.

01:00:03.204 --> 01:00:04.122
Let's go home.

01:00:12.422 --> 01:00:13.381
I'm late.

01:00:45.413 --> 01:00:47.165
I'm a 20-year-old Hong Jang-mi.

01:00:47.248 --> 01:00:48.332
A-E-I…

01:01:34.045 --> 01:01:36.756
I can't believe even the
midnight screening was sold out.

01:01:36.839 --> 01:01:37.924
Well, it's Saturday night.

01:01:39.342 --> 01:01:42.261
Do you slice your pork cutlet
before every bite?

01:01:42.345 --> 01:01:43.638
Or do you slice it all up first?

01:01:43.721 --> 01:01:45.431
I slice it up first.

01:01:45.515 --> 01:01:46.682
I'd rather get it done before.

01:01:47.266 --> 01:01:48.184
Okay.

01:01:54.232 --> 01:01:55.566
Go on and slice mine up too.

01:01:55.650 --> 01:01:56.609
Bite-sized, please.

01:02:00.071 --> 01:02:01.155
I'm kidding.

01:02:06.869 --> 01:02:09.580
By the way, I read on Yeouido Pirates

01:02:09.664 --> 01:02:11.582
that you all live at the chairman's place.

01:02:13.584 --> 01:02:16.212
You, Executive Director Oh,

01:02:16.796 --> 01:02:18.297
and even Ms. Song?

01:02:19.215 --> 01:02:21.926
Is it like round-the-clock assistance
or something?

01:02:24.136 --> 01:02:25.012
I'm actually…

01:02:27.014 --> 01:02:29.183
more curious about
what you discussed with President Shin

01:02:29.267 --> 01:02:30.351
that day in the elevator.

01:02:32.937 --> 01:02:33.938
Oh, that?

01:02:34.564 --> 01:02:36.399
What did I ask him again?

01:02:36.482 --> 01:02:37.733
Right.

01:02:37.817 --> 01:02:42.280
I asked him if he already signed off
on this quarter's Outstanding Woman.

01:02:53.124 --> 01:02:54.250
That's nice.

01:02:56.627 --> 01:02:57.587
Pass me my phone.

01:03:02.717 --> 01:03:03.634
Hello?

01:03:04.385 --> 01:03:05.303
Hey, Nora.

01:03:07.013 --> 01:03:09.307
The president came
all the way to the dorm.

01:03:11.350 --> 01:03:14.270
I mean, who else does he know here but me?

01:03:15.146 --> 01:03:15.980
What?

01:03:16.856 --> 01:03:20.484
He showed up at your place
in the middle of the night?

01:03:22.194 --> 01:03:23.779
This is 100% romance.

01:03:23.863 --> 01:03:26.657
That's really how he feels about me?

01:03:27.533 --> 01:03:28.784
He never said that to me though.

01:03:28.868 --> 01:03:30.745
You just don't know.

01:03:30.828 --> 01:03:33.956
When it comes to men,
what matters is how much time and money

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:35.583
they spend on a woman.

01:03:35.666 --> 01:03:36.751
That's all.

01:03:36.834 --> 01:03:40.171
He did say he wanted to take me
to a tasty restaurant next time.

01:03:40.254 --> 01:03:43.132
That's spending money and time,
you big dummy.

01:03:43.633 --> 01:03:44.467
That was

01:03:45.176 --> 01:03:46.218
a declaration of love.

01:03:51.015 --> 01:03:53.517
{\an8}PRESIDENT SHIN JUNG-WOO

01:03:58.898 --> 01:04:01.567
Ms. Go, can I get something to drink?

01:04:20.836 --> 01:04:21.712
Thank you.

01:04:29.136 --> 01:04:31.222
Gosh, what brings you by?

01:04:31.931 --> 01:04:33.599
Did I surprise you?

01:04:34.517 --> 01:04:36.686
Yes, a bit…

01:04:36.769 --> 01:04:38.312
Well, I was even more surprised.

01:04:38.896 --> 01:04:39.855
Don't come to the dorms!

01:04:41.023 --> 01:04:41.983
I must survive

01:04:42.692 --> 01:04:45.695
the three-month probationary period
and become a full-time employee.

01:04:47.613 --> 01:04:48.489
Why?

01:04:48.572 --> 01:04:49.490
If I do,

01:04:50.032 --> 01:04:52.702
my father will give me an additional 9%
of the company's shares.

01:04:52.785 --> 01:04:53.911
So my mom insisted that I do.

01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:56.914
Anyway,

01:04:56.998 --> 01:04:58.874
I understand how you feel,

01:04:58.958 --> 01:05:00.292
but I'm not there yet.

01:05:01.669 --> 01:05:03.004
Stop liking me so much already!

01:05:04.338 --> 01:05:05.339
I…

01:05:18.394 --> 01:05:20.688
{\an8}FULL-SERVICE SHOE REPAIR

01:05:20.771 --> 01:05:22.606
That's good.

01:05:22.690 --> 01:05:23.816
Thank you.

01:05:23.899 --> 01:05:26.777
- Excuse me for a moment.
- Sure. Go ahead.

01:05:33.576 --> 01:05:35.494
The police closed the Kim I-gyeong case

01:05:35.578 --> 01:05:37.163
as a suicide,

01:05:37.788 --> 01:05:39.623
but her family refuses to accept it.

01:05:39.707 --> 01:05:41.042
The funeral has been postponed.

01:05:42.585 --> 01:05:45.212
And it seems
someone else is also looking for

01:05:45.796 --> 01:05:47.381
the CEO of Onemillion.

01:05:53.971 --> 01:05:55.389
HORANG AUTO REPAIR SHOP
BONG DAL-SU

01:05:58.100 --> 01:05:59.393
Horang Auto Repair Shop.

01:06:00.603 --> 01:06:02.813
I hear he might be an investor
who got scammed.

01:06:03.314 --> 01:06:07.109
But his address
is on the outskirts of Seoul.

01:06:08.402 --> 01:06:09.528
I'll check him out.

01:06:22.041 --> 01:06:24.418
Can we take a rain check
on the movie tonight?

01:06:54.281 --> 01:06:57.118
Okay. I'm being dragged to
a family gathering tonight as well.

01:07:02.873 --> 01:07:04.166
Is he not here yet?

01:07:05.042 --> 01:07:07.253
No, but Albert is on his way.

01:07:07.336 --> 01:07:09.880
There must be a lot of traffic.

01:07:09.964 --> 01:07:12.675
Traffic in Seoul is nothing new.

01:07:12.758 --> 01:07:15.553
How could he have
all these adults waiting for him?

01:07:17.096 --> 01:07:18.597
He's been so busy.

01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:23.144
Oh, that must be him.

01:07:25.521 --> 01:07:27.314
Gosh, President Shin!

01:07:30.943 --> 01:07:32.987
Surprise, Chairman!

01:07:35.489 --> 01:07:37.408
I also invited President Shin.

01:07:37.992 --> 01:07:39.827
He's future family, after all.

01:07:40.619 --> 01:07:41.537
Welcome.

01:07:42.288 --> 01:07:43.455
I knew.

01:07:43.539 --> 01:07:45.541
He reached out to me.

01:07:45.624 --> 01:07:48.794
He didn't want to intrude
on a family gathering.

01:07:49.295 --> 01:07:51.797
It was about time everyone met like this,

01:07:52.381 --> 01:07:53.841
so I told him it was fine.

01:07:53.924 --> 01:07:55.843
How considerate.

01:07:56.427 --> 01:07:58.429
President Shin,
you can take that second chair.

01:07:58.512 --> 01:07:59.805
Go on, sit.

01:08:04.226 --> 01:08:05.352
Right.

01:08:05.436 --> 01:08:07.938
It always looks like
there's food for everyone

01:08:08.981 --> 01:08:11.108
but none for me.

01:08:12.610 --> 01:08:14.778
Let's eat now.

01:08:14.862 --> 01:08:15.821
Sure.

01:08:15.905 --> 01:08:17.907
Enjoy, everyone.

01:08:29.543 --> 01:08:31.921
HORANG AUTO REPAIR SHOP

01:08:40.638 --> 01:08:42.014
{\an8}HORANG AUTO REPAIR SHOP

01:09:13.379 --> 01:09:14.546
Albert?

01:09:16.465 --> 01:09:17.758
What's he doing here?

01:09:41.115 --> 01:09:42.574
This is why

01:09:42.658 --> 01:09:45.577
you should know your place and not act up.

01:10:11.478 --> 01:10:15.316
{\an8}SPECIAL THANKS TO SHIN YU-NA
FOR HER APPEARANCE

01:10:47.014 --> 01:10:48.849
{\an8}UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

01:10:49.391 --> 01:10:50.976
{\an8}I thought he was just another deadbeat.

01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:52.394
{\an8}Who is he really?

01:10:53.145 --> 01:10:56.648
{\an8}For all we know,
Albert could be managing the slush fund.

01:10:57.441 --> 01:10:58.942
{\an8}Congratulations!
This quarter's Outstanding Woman

01:10:59.026 --> 01:11:00.277
{\an8}is Hong Jang-mi!

01:11:00.361 --> 01:11:02.821
{\an8}That OW money must be in
Hong Jang-mi's account now.

01:11:02.905 --> 01:11:04.948
{\an8}There's some easy money at the company.

01:11:05.532 --> 01:11:06.658
{\an8}Where did you get that notebook from?

01:11:06.742 --> 01:11:10.412
{\an8}Maybe she knows about Yehppee
and the slush fund ledger as well?

01:11:10.496 --> 01:11:11.747
{\an8}Hello, Yehppee.

01:11:12.289 --> 01:11:13.248
{\an8}I'd like to meet you.

01:11:13.332 --> 01:11:15.334
{\an8}No woman should be there alone this late.

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:22.925
