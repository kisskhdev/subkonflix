WEBVTT

00:01:12.845 --> 00:01:14.847
Now I remember...

00:01:15.764 --> 00:01:16.849
this man.

00:01:37.036 --> 00:01:38.287
Are you okay?

00:01:40.372 --> 00:01:41.790
I'm okay.

00:01:41.874 --> 00:01:43.208
Let's find Se-jin first.

00:01:44.668 --> 00:01:47.087
She probably couldn't get off
since it's too crowded.

00:01:48.088 --> 00:01:49.506
Maybe she went to the front car.

00:01:52.384 --> 00:01:55.220
That's him. The guy who was with Se-jin.

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:58.557
Darn it.

00:01:59.558 --> 00:02:00.392
Darn it. (Support Admin Watch on

00:02:01.435 --> 00:02:02.394
Excuse me.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:05.981
Sorry, coming through.

00:02:09.276 --> 00:02:10.402
Mister.

00:02:19.203 --> 00:02:20.120
Sun Jae-gyu?

00:02:24.708 --> 00:02:25.626
Choi I-jun.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.171
So you're alive.

00:02:32.758 --> 00:02:35.260
Are you the guy who was with Se-jin?

00:02:36.762 --> 00:02:37.596
Hey.

00:02:39.098 --> 00:02:40.975
Why bring a high school girl here?

00:02:41.058 --> 00:02:45.396
I spent ten years trying to find you,
and that's all you have to say?

00:02:47.356 --> 00:02:50.275
Shouldn't you at least ask
how I've been first?

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.152
I don't care about that.

00:02:53.862 --> 00:02:54.738
You don't...

00:02:55.614 --> 00:02:56.490
care?

00:02:58.534 --> 00:02:59.660
Answer me.

00:03:00.661 --> 00:03:02.454
What's your relationship with Se-jin?

00:03:05.582 --> 00:03:07.793
I don't care about your relationship,

00:03:07.876 --> 00:03:09.461
and I don't want to know.

00:03:09.545 --> 00:03:12.840
Whether you talk things out
or fight it out, do it later.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.052
Let me ask you as Se-jin's teacher.

00:03:18.137 --> 00:03:20.222
Where is she right now?

00:03:29.481 --> 00:03:31.025
I should introduce myself.

00:03:32.443 --> 00:03:33.277
I'm...

00:03:34.945 --> 00:03:35.988
Se-jin's older brother.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.574
Her brother?

00:03:39.575 --> 00:03:42.244
I'm not sure why
her teacher has come all the way here,

00:03:42.327 --> 00:03:45.289
but if you thought Se-jin ran away,

00:03:45.372 --> 00:03:46.832
there's no reason to worry.

00:03:47.875 --> 00:03:48.917
This runaway

00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:51.587
was entirely under my watch
as her older brother...

00:03:52.296 --> 00:03:55.841
and our parents have already been updated
on where she is.

00:03:55.924 --> 00:03:56.842
What?

00:04:00.012 --> 00:04:00.888
Wait.

00:04:01.972 --> 00:04:05.809
So my big plan wasn't a disappearance...

00:04:06.602 --> 00:04:08.020
but just an outing?

00:04:13.067 --> 00:04:14.860
EPISODE 3

00:04:21.784 --> 00:04:23.118
I'm sorry.

00:04:23.202 --> 00:04:26.205
I heard Se-jin would be staying
at some guy's place,

00:04:26.288 --> 00:04:27.247
so I was scared.

00:04:28.082 --> 00:04:30.542
I ended up telling you
without checking first.

00:04:31.794 --> 00:04:34.797
It turned out to be a misunderstanding,
but you meant well.

00:04:35.881 --> 00:04:38.884
Our students are in the same class
for all three years,

00:04:38.967 --> 00:04:41.762
so you're more like family than friends.
It's natural to worry.

00:04:43.097 --> 00:04:46.767
Yes, coming all this way
was the right choice.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.185
You were brave, Han-gyul.

00:04:49.686 --> 00:04:53.148
Choi Se-jin must be really mad.

00:04:55.692 --> 00:04:57.361
Evil Han-gyul, that traitor.

00:04:58.278 --> 00:05:00.739
I can't believe he told on me.

00:05:00.823 --> 00:05:02.574
And to that hypocrite teacher.

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:07.996
Why on earth was Sun Jae-gyu
with Yoon Bom?

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.997
Wait.

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:11.625
You know my teacher's name?

00:05:12.543 --> 00:05:13.377
What?

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:17.840
I heard it earlier on the subway.

00:05:19.925 --> 00:05:20.759
By the way,

00:05:20.843 --> 00:05:23.512
what does Sun Jae-gyu do there?

00:05:24.221 --> 00:05:27.224
Has it been just him and Han-gyul?
No other family?

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:29.434
Jjun?

00:05:30.561 --> 00:05:34.898
Are we talking about Han-gyul's uncle
or about me?

00:05:34.982 --> 00:05:38.277
What's going on with you
and Han-gyul's uncle?

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.160
Here, what does "gangho" mean?

00:05:47.035 --> 00:05:48.954
"Gang" is river and "ho" is lake.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.168
This kind of comparison to nature
is called a metaphor.

00:05:59.131 --> 00:06:03.177
Gosh, here we go again.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.053
Hey, Sun Jae-gyu!

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.394
I'm sorry.
There's no one at home to watch him.

00:06:13.395 --> 00:06:15.856
Sorry about that, guys. I'm sorry.

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:20.194
If I-jun doesn't get into
Hanguk University because of your nephew,

00:06:20.277 --> 00:06:21.653
what are you going to do?

00:06:21.737 --> 00:06:23.864
He's not even your son.
Why did you have to

00:06:23.947 --> 00:06:26.491
bring your nephew all the way to school?

00:06:26.575 --> 00:06:29.536
Don't you have any family at home?

00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:33.290
My dad is out on the boat and my sister--

00:06:33.373 --> 00:06:34.708
Have you ever seen his sister?

00:06:35.334 --> 00:06:38.420
I've never seen her at home.

00:06:38.503 --> 00:06:39.379
Tell me about it.

00:06:45.594 --> 00:06:46.762
I-jun.

00:06:49.973 --> 00:06:51.934
No, I-jun. Hold on, calm down.

00:06:52.017 --> 00:06:53.060
Calm down.

00:06:55.437 --> 00:06:56.271
What?

00:06:57.064 --> 00:06:59.233
Hey, what are you doing?

00:07:09.534 --> 00:07:10.953
Hey, what's your deal?

00:07:11.828 --> 00:07:15.332
I thought you were just smart.
You're good with babies, too?

00:07:15.415 --> 00:07:16.959
My family happens to have...

00:07:18.085 --> 00:07:19.670
a tiny little one like him.

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:23.048
Now let me study.

00:07:25.634 --> 00:07:26.635
Come here.

00:07:29.179 --> 00:07:31.974
Oh, my goodness.

00:07:33.183 --> 00:07:35.269
Let's give it up for I-jun!

00:07:35.352 --> 00:07:36.937
There's no one like him.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.272
We started out as friends...

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.839
but ended up strangers.

00:08:08.343 --> 00:08:11.930
One's romantic, the other's into action.

00:08:12.973 --> 00:08:16.852
Based on your looks and style,
it makes sense you're strangers.

00:08:16.935 --> 00:08:18.270
We are strangers.

00:08:20.647 --> 00:08:23.233
He said that
he's been looking for you for ten years.

00:08:23.942 --> 00:08:26.611
If he were really a stranger,
would he search that long?

00:08:26.695 --> 00:08:29.948
It's obvious
why he tried so hard to find me.

00:08:30.741 --> 00:08:31.742
Why?

00:08:36.413 --> 00:08:37.456
Forget about him.

00:08:38.081 --> 00:08:41.293
He's got nothing to do with my life.

00:08:56.558 --> 00:08:59.853
Wait, we should be getting on the highway.
Why are we at a hotel?

00:09:01.438 --> 00:09:05.650
We've covered 400 km
in 5 hours and 20 minutes.

00:09:05.734 --> 00:09:07.110
We've traveled a lot.

00:09:07.778 --> 00:09:11.948
It's the same distance back home.
Imagine how exhausting that's going to be.

00:09:12.032 --> 00:09:14.368
I know you're tired from driving, but--

00:09:14.451 --> 00:09:16.286
I'm not tired at all.

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:18.663
I'm talking about him, not me.

00:09:20.165 --> 00:09:22.626
He's supposed to eat and sleep properly,

00:09:22.709 --> 00:09:25.170
but he's only had noodles
and stayed up all night.

00:09:25.253 --> 00:09:28.298
Shouldn't we let him wash up
and get some sleep?

00:09:29.841 --> 00:09:31.259
Even so...

00:09:32.094 --> 00:09:33.011
Hop out.

00:09:39.393 --> 00:09:40.602
Sorry about earlier.

00:09:42.646 --> 00:09:43.939
Text me when you see this.

00:09:46.525 --> 00:09:47.859
I'm sorry.

00:09:47.943 --> 00:09:50.904
It's the weekend, so all the rooms are...

00:09:50.987 --> 00:09:51.988
No rooms?

00:09:52.656 --> 00:09:55.200
Looks like there aren't any rooms.
We better go home.

00:09:55.283 --> 00:09:56.576
Yes, there is.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.663
It's a family room
with a double bed and a single bed.

00:09:59.746 --> 00:10:01.331
We'll take it.

00:10:01.415 --> 00:10:02.290
What?

00:10:02.916 --> 00:10:05.919
It's a family room for family.
What's the problem?

00:10:06.002 --> 00:10:07.963
You two are family, but we're not.

00:10:08.839 --> 00:10:10.841
You said
everyone at that school is family.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.802
Don't you get figures of speech?

00:10:13.885 --> 00:10:15.762
Why do you take everything literally?

00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:19.599
Do you want to do something in the room?

00:10:21.059 --> 00:10:22.352
As if.

00:10:22.436 --> 00:10:24.604
Then we have only one purpose.

00:10:24.688 --> 00:10:25.522
Sleep.

00:10:26.356 --> 00:10:28.984
A family room fits that purpose perfectly.

00:10:29.067 --> 00:10:31.278
It's cheaper than getting two rooms.

00:10:31.361 --> 00:10:32.529
Why can't we sleep there?

00:10:50.046 --> 00:10:50.881
Darn it.

00:10:50.964 --> 00:10:53.341
It's a family room.
This isn't family-oriented.

00:11:04.895 --> 00:11:06.563
You go wash up first.

00:11:06.646 --> 00:11:07.814
No, you first.

00:11:18.783 --> 00:11:21.286
Han-gyul, you look tired.
Go ahead and wash up first.

00:11:21.369 --> 00:11:23.705
Yeah, you go first.

00:11:24.372 --> 00:11:25.999
-Then I'll go first.
-Okay.

00:11:44.434 --> 00:11:47.187
Why are you doing push-ups
all of a sudden?

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:48.688
Exercise is a habit.

00:11:50.774 --> 00:11:51.650
Are you busy?

00:11:51.733 --> 00:11:53.485
Why would I be busy here?

00:11:53.568 --> 00:11:54.611
Want to get on my back?

00:11:54.694 --> 00:11:56.905
Why would I get on a parent's back?

00:11:56.988 --> 00:11:59.991
It doesn't even feel like a workout
with no weights.

00:12:05.413 --> 00:12:06.498
Hold my legs.

00:12:07.791 --> 00:12:08.917
I'm busy.

00:12:10.335 --> 00:12:12.963
You're a teacher.
Why do you keep switching up?

00:12:13.046 --> 00:12:14.339
You said you weren't busy.

00:12:19.427 --> 00:12:20.512
Some teacher you are.

00:12:26.309 --> 00:12:27.143
All right.

00:12:30.188 --> 00:12:31.439
I'll do 100 reps, okay?

00:12:55.505 --> 00:12:57.299
If you want to work out, go out.

00:12:57.382 --> 00:12:59.676
This hotel has a pool and a gym.

00:13:00.302 --> 00:13:01.886
Don't do it in the room, okay?

00:13:09.394 --> 00:13:11.771
Han-gyul.

00:13:13.857 --> 00:13:15.066
Come on out.

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:16.318
Is he sleeping or what?

00:13:54.981 --> 00:13:55.857
What the heck?

00:13:56.816 --> 00:13:57.776
Is the kid alone?

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:12.999
"That woman"?

00:14:13.917 --> 00:14:15.085
Who's "that woman"?

00:14:16.586 --> 00:14:18.380
A female friend? Someone he's seeing?

00:14:20.256 --> 00:14:21.925
Could it be his ex?

00:14:39.693 --> 00:14:41.027
Where on earth is he?

00:14:43.446 --> 00:14:45.907
Oh, my! Hey, kid!

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:47.867
Are you okay? Oh, no!

00:14:49.786 --> 00:14:52.330
Hey, kid! Gosh, what do I do?

00:15:06.928 --> 00:15:08.221
Mr. Sun?

00:15:11.224 --> 00:15:12.267
Wait right there!

00:15:14.144 --> 00:15:15.437
Don't move!

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:41.755
Stay right there!

00:15:46.426 --> 00:15:47.552
Stay calm!

00:15:49.721 --> 00:15:51.139
Geez.

00:15:51.848 --> 00:15:53.767
Are you okay, kiddo?

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:55.769
-You're fine. Stop crying.
-Is he okay?

00:15:55.852 --> 00:15:57.395
-Ji-u!
-Your mom's here.

00:16:00.273 --> 00:16:01.441
Are you all right?

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:04.027
He scared me.

00:16:04.819 --> 00:16:06.488
Why? What happened?

00:16:06.571 --> 00:16:09.616
Did he do something to you?

00:16:12.994 --> 00:16:13.828
Ma'am.

00:16:14.454 --> 00:16:16.790
I know I scared him,
but what happened is--

00:16:16.873 --> 00:16:17.874
How dare you!

00:16:27.634 --> 00:16:28.551
What the heck?

00:16:29.636 --> 00:16:31.721
What did you do with my husband?

00:16:32.847 --> 00:16:35.058
Ma'am, what do you mean--

00:16:35.141 --> 00:16:37.018
I've checked all the evidence!

00:16:38.978 --> 00:16:40.688
Your late-night calls...

00:16:42.565 --> 00:16:44.901
and you two meeting at your place!

00:16:48.822 --> 00:16:50.865
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:52.367
Your husband and I are not--

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:54.744
I heard you flirted with him first.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:56.204
Ma'am.

00:16:56.871 --> 00:16:58.790
You told him how caring he was.

00:17:00.333 --> 00:17:01.918
You came on to him first!

00:17:02.001 --> 00:17:04.838
No, ma'am, that's not... Wait.

00:17:04.921 --> 00:17:05.755
Right?

00:17:09.175 --> 00:17:10.510
What's wrong with you?

00:17:10.593 --> 00:17:12.428
What did you do to my kid?

00:17:13.096 --> 00:17:15.807
All right, please calm down.

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:17.767
He must've been startled.

00:17:17.851 --> 00:17:20.186
If there's a pharmacy nearby,
get him some medicine.

00:17:21.938 --> 00:17:23.690
Unbelievable. Let's go.

00:17:24.732 --> 00:17:25.817
Take care!

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.028
Why aren't you explaining yourself?

00:17:30.446 --> 00:17:33.825
She should be thanking you.
Why did you just take the blame?

00:17:34.784 --> 00:17:37.996
It's fine as long as the kid's okay.
Why bother explaining?

00:17:38.079 --> 00:17:39.038
No.

00:17:39.122 --> 00:17:41.332
What needs to be done needs to be done.

00:17:42.375 --> 00:17:45.962
Once something's buried,
it's tough to dig it up later.

00:17:47.714 --> 00:17:48.715
Excuse me!

00:17:50.383 --> 00:17:51.384
Wait up!

00:17:58.224 --> 00:18:03.021
So, Dong-pyo, are you saying
you've personally met that great person?

00:18:03.104 --> 00:18:04.105
I have.

00:18:04.731 --> 00:18:07.609
He'd have been thrilled
if he'd met you all.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:15.825
But... the so-called great person
hasn't shown up.

00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:17.869
How long
should we keep crawling like this?

00:18:17.952 --> 00:18:20.246
This is how everyone starts.
All right, get up.

00:18:20.872 --> 00:18:23.499
Now, let's try the position
while lying down.

00:18:24.834 --> 00:18:26.961
You two are a pair, and you two.

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:28.504
Master.

00:18:29.172 --> 00:18:31.341
You want me to pair up with a woman?

00:18:31.424 --> 00:18:32.634
Look.

00:18:32.717 --> 00:18:35.845
Jiu jitsu is about skill, not strength.

00:18:35.929 --> 00:18:38.681
Why are you treating
men and women differently even here?

00:18:38.765 --> 00:18:39.724
Forget it.

00:18:40.725 --> 00:18:41.684
Dong-pyo.

00:18:42.393 --> 00:18:44.187
-Guard recovery.
-Yes, sir.

00:18:44.896 --> 00:18:45.980
What?

00:18:46.064 --> 00:18:48.191
-Look carefully.
-Yes, sir.

00:18:48.274 --> 00:18:51.027
The person on the bottom uses their legs

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:53.488
to keep the person on top
from moving around.

00:18:53.571 --> 00:18:55.073
Want to try an attack?

00:18:55.156 --> 00:18:56.199
-Me?
-Yes.

00:18:56.282 --> 00:18:58.451
Just get on top. Come on, follow along.

00:19:02.747 --> 00:19:04.290
-Oh, like this?
-Attack.

00:19:04.374 --> 00:19:05.208
Come on.

00:19:05.291 --> 00:19:08.211
All right, like this.

00:19:09.128 --> 00:19:11.714
Like this.

00:19:13.174 --> 00:19:14.175
Like this.

00:19:14.258 --> 00:19:16.928
Like this.

00:19:17.011 --> 00:19:18.680
Like this, right?

00:19:18.763 --> 00:19:20.640
Wow, is this really your first time?

00:19:20.723 --> 00:19:23.685
You're like a pro in a training video.

00:19:23.768 --> 00:19:25.228
Is that so? Am I doing okay?

00:19:25.311 --> 00:19:26.938
You're incredible.

00:19:27.522 --> 00:19:29.023
Now, head up and try faster.

00:19:29.107 --> 00:19:30.483
Faster. Like this.

00:19:30.566 --> 00:19:32.402
Like this.

00:19:32.485 --> 00:19:33.611
Like this.

00:19:33.695 --> 00:19:36.447
Like this.

00:19:37.365 --> 00:19:38.491
Geez, seriously.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.271
Darn it. That woman...

00:20:08.938 --> 00:20:10.189
I knew this would happen.

00:20:10.273 --> 00:20:11.607
Did it burst?

00:20:11.691 --> 00:20:12.734
Did what burst?

00:20:14.193 --> 00:20:15.987
Stop with the nonsense and just go.

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:19.657
Looks like there's a bit of a problem.

00:20:19.741 --> 00:20:21.576
-Are you okay?
-What's wrong with you?

00:20:22.118 --> 00:20:24.495
Go, just go!

00:20:25.413 --> 00:20:29.292
Check if there's an injury
and let me know.

00:20:29.375 --> 00:20:32.003
Maybe you need to go to the hospital,
or maybe rest will do.

00:20:32.086 --> 00:20:33.504
I'll need to pay for it.

00:20:33.588 --> 00:20:35.715
And how are you going to pay for it, huh?

00:20:36.299 --> 00:20:38.676
What if I never marry and end up alone?

00:20:39.427 --> 00:20:41.220
How will you pay me back?

00:20:41.304 --> 00:20:43.431
-I guess you want to get married.
-Of course.

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:46.893
Even if I end up getting divorced
like someone I know,

00:20:46.976 --> 00:20:48.019
I'll at least try.

00:20:49.103 --> 00:20:51.272
What's with the jab at me?

00:20:51.355 --> 00:20:52.273
Look, ma'am.

00:20:53.024 --> 00:20:54.942
A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.696
Stop going around and causing trouble.

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:02.700
From now on,
just take care of your kids at home.

00:21:03.409 --> 00:21:04.285
Okay?

00:21:04.368 --> 00:21:06.996
SPORTS CENTER

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.581
Just look at yourself.

00:21:08.664 --> 00:21:13.044
With that hot temper of yours,
how could any girl like you?

00:21:13.127 --> 00:21:16.255
Go home and look in the mirror.
You think you're still handsome?

00:21:16.339 --> 00:21:18.299
Your face is all dark and wrinkly.

00:21:18.382 --> 00:21:22.136
And why's your head so tiny?
Can a brain even fit in there?

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:23.596
Goodness.

00:21:23.679 --> 00:21:26.265
With a face like that,
you ought to speak politely.

00:21:26.349 --> 00:21:28.142
Otherwise, forget about getting married.

00:21:29.352 --> 00:21:30.895
My goodness.

00:21:48.913 --> 00:21:51.374
I'm so sorry. My apologies.

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:55.128
You should apologize... to her.

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.756
She'd been up all night
and was about to rest,

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:02.009
but she couldn't catch her breath
before checking the security footage.

00:22:06.722 --> 00:22:09.183
I'm terribly sorry.

00:22:09.267 --> 00:22:10.184
My apologies.

00:22:21.696 --> 00:22:25.032
SE-JIN, SORRY ABOUT EARLIER
TEXT ME WHEN YOU SEE THIS

00:22:29.537 --> 00:22:31.038
Put the phone down. Lights out.

00:22:31.831 --> 00:22:32.748
Lights out now.

00:22:34.709 --> 00:22:35.751
Good night.

00:22:44.677 --> 00:22:45.761
SE-JIN

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:50.975
Uncle, I'll go take this call.

00:22:51.058 --> 00:22:52.059
Han-gyul, take it here.

00:23:27.386 --> 00:23:28.804
Beautiful.

00:23:34.894 --> 00:23:37.021
Shiny and bright.

00:23:37.104 --> 00:23:38.606
So beautiful, like a star.

00:23:42.276 --> 00:23:43.110
What?

00:23:47.823 --> 00:23:49.909
What did you just say?

00:23:51.744 --> 00:23:53.537
Seoul is different, huh?

00:23:54.163 --> 00:23:55.498
Look at the tower lights.

00:23:56.207 --> 00:23:57.333
Wow, awesome.

00:24:15.351 --> 00:24:16.477
Good night.

00:24:20.856 --> 00:24:21.732
Let's sleep.

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:38.833
Doesn't she remember me yet?

00:24:40.084 --> 00:24:41.877
How much does he remember?

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:48.009
She'll remember eventually.

00:24:49.552 --> 00:24:52.013
Maybe it's better to pretend
I don't remember.

00:25:41.062 --> 00:25:42.146
I found her.

00:25:43.147 --> 00:25:44.357
You found her?

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.401
You made a fuss that you couldn't,
but how?

00:25:48.027 --> 00:25:49.862
-Mom.
-You're here.

00:25:50.654 --> 00:25:52.656
-Mom, did you lose weight?
-Really?

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:53.866
You look gorgeous.

00:25:53.949 --> 00:25:54.992
-Really?
-Yes.

00:25:56.619 --> 00:25:58.579
-You went to the salon?
-Yes, I did.

00:25:58.662 --> 00:26:00.706
-Do I look pretty?
-Yes.

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:01.916
You too.

00:26:01.999 --> 00:26:03.042
Thanks.

00:26:03.125 --> 00:26:05.044
It's too light to be a coincidence...

00:26:09.632 --> 00:26:11.592
Let me ask you as Se-jin's teacher.

00:26:12.134 --> 00:26:14.178
Where is she right now?

00:26:15.221 --> 00:26:17.098
...and too heavy to be fate.

00:26:18.057 --> 00:26:19.975
I'd call it a meaningful connection.

00:26:20.976 --> 00:26:25.189
She lives in the same neighborhood
as the person I was looking for.

00:26:25.272 --> 00:26:27.274
Who? That jerk?

00:26:28.275 --> 00:26:31.320
That dumb brute
who ran off with your money?

00:26:32.571 --> 00:26:33.489
Where is she?

00:26:33.572 --> 00:26:36.325
Where the heck is she hiding?

00:26:36.409 --> 00:26:37.243
I can't tell you.

00:26:37.326 --> 00:26:41.372
If Miss Bom cut ties with her family
on purpose, there must be a reason.

00:26:42.039 --> 00:26:43.457
I can't get involved...

00:26:44.041 --> 00:26:46.043
-and hurt her even more.
-"Bom"?

00:26:47.628 --> 00:26:48.712
My homeroom teacher?

00:26:50.297 --> 00:26:53.551
Anyway, I'll be in touch
once I'm in Seoul.

00:26:57.012 --> 00:26:57.888
Jjun.

00:26:58.931 --> 00:27:01.225
Can't you be a lawyer here
instead of Seoul?

00:27:02.351 --> 00:27:07.773
I said you asked me to come,
and Mom and Dad didn't nag me at all.

00:27:08.899 --> 00:27:10.943
If you help me with my studies,

00:27:11.026 --> 00:27:13.529
I think I could beat Evil Han-gyul.
Please?

00:27:14.447 --> 00:27:15.281
First...

00:27:17.116 --> 00:27:18.033
give me his address.

00:27:18.117 --> 00:27:19.160
Whose?

00:27:20.953 --> 00:27:21.996
Han-gyul's uncle's?

00:27:26.959 --> 00:27:29.378
Who cares if I remember or not?

00:27:29.462 --> 00:27:30.838
He won't know if I stay quiet.

00:27:32.131 --> 00:27:36.343
Yeah, I'll just keep my mouth shut
and try not to get involved with him.

00:27:36.427 --> 00:27:38.053
Didn't you lose your other half?

00:27:38.137 --> 00:27:39.346
Sorry?

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:42.099
I'll find my other half on my own.

00:27:42.183 --> 00:27:43.184
Where?

00:27:43.893 --> 00:27:45.644
-It's right here.
-What?

00:27:45.728 --> 00:27:48.481
There's nothing like hip-hop
on the way to work.

00:27:48.564 --> 00:27:50.274
You have good taste in music.

00:27:50.357 --> 00:27:53.319
Why is my other earbud in your ear?

00:27:53.402 --> 00:27:55.321
Han-gyul probably thought it was mine.

00:27:56.405 --> 00:27:58.908
We were in Seoul during the weekend--

00:27:58.991 --> 00:28:01.827
Why are you whispering so loudly?

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:15.508
Darn it. I told him to bring an umbrella.

00:28:32.233 --> 00:28:34.109
Miss Bom, I heard everything earlier.

00:28:34.818 --> 00:28:36.946
Did you go to Seoul with Sun Jae-gyu?

00:28:40.991 --> 00:28:42.660
There was a reason behind it.

00:28:42.743 --> 00:28:44.203
Aren't you hurt?

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.665
Mr. Sun isn't that kind of person.

00:28:47.748 --> 00:28:49.500
What, are you defending him?

00:28:50.626 --> 00:28:53.337
I'm not defending him.
I want to clear up the misunderstanding.

00:28:54.088 --> 00:28:57.466
He went to Seoul
to help Han-gyul's friend.

00:28:57.550 --> 00:29:00.886
He's the type to endure humiliation
even after saving a kid from drowning.

00:29:02.137 --> 00:29:03.847
We should also check

00:29:03.931 --> 00:29:06.350
if Mr. Hong really hurt his hand
because of Mr. Sun.

00:29:06.934 --> 00:29:08.018
What's gotten into you?

00:29:09.061 --> 00:29:12.481
You spent just a few days together
and you've completely fallen for him.

00:29:14.191 --> 00:29:15.317
Miss Bom.

00:29:15.401 --> 00:29:16.944
Take my advice.

00:29:17.027 --> 00:29:20.531
It's best to stay away from Sun Jae-gyu
if possible.

00:29:20.614 --> 00:29:23.075
I've seen him downtown--

00:29:23.158 --> 00:29:24.368
What about Sun Jae-gyu?

00:29:24.451 --> 00:29:25.327
Why?

00:29:26.161 --> 00:29:27.288
Did something happen?

00:29:29.373 --> 00:29:30.499
I mean...

00:29:31.375 --> 00:29:34.211
just think about what he's like
all the time.

00:29:34.295 --> 00:29:36.130
When it comes to Han-gyul,

00:29:36.213 --> 00:29:39.049
he flips out and storms in here,
causing a scene.

00:29:39.133 --> 00:29:40.009
But with Han-gyul...

00:29:40.676 --> 00:29:43.095
he's so caring and sweet.

00:29:43.721 --> 00:29:46.473
Who would think he's his uncle?

00:29:46.974 --> 00:29:49.435
When he should have been out
meeting girls,

00:29:49.518 --> 00:29:52.229
he didn't date anyone
because he was taking care of Han-gyul.

00:29:52.855 --> 00:29:55.441
Gosh, no one could do that
even for their own kid.

00:29:57.735 --> 00:29:59.028
Then it must be his own kid.

00:30:00.362 --> 00:30:01.280
What?

00:30:02.615 --> 00:30:03.991
Gather around.

00:30:11.874 --> 00:30:13.500
It's fresh.

00:30:13.584 --> 00:30:15.127
The other day, I was downtown

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:17.713
and saw this guy with huge shoulders,
built like a tank,

00:30:17.796 --> 00:30:19.923
and a dragon tattoo running down his arm.

00:30:20.007 --> 00:30:23.594
A guy that looked just like Sun Jae-gyu
was with some woman.

00:30:24.136 --> 00:30:24.970
A woman?

00:30:27.389 --> 00:30:29.224
You've got some nerve
to ask about the kid.

00:30:29.767 --> 00:30:33.854
She was facing him
and going on about some kid.

00:30:33.937 --> 00:30:36.523
She was crying her eyes out.

00:30:37.107 --> 00:30:38.233
-Miss Seo.
-Yes.

00:30:39.902 --> 00:30:42.571
Is that true? Are you sure you saw it?

00:30:43.656 --> 00:30:48.035
Principal, who else in Shinsu
would walk around with a dragon tattoo

00:30:48.118 --> 00:30:49.620
besides Sun Jae-gyu?

00:30:50.913 --> 00:30:51.830
Am I right?

00:30:52.456 --> 00:30:55.125
Looks can say a lot about someone.

00:30:55.209 --> 00:30:59.338
His eyes are all sharp
and his whole body oozes desire,

00:30:59.421 --> 00:31:00.923
hitting on one girl after another.

00:31:01.006 --> 00:31:04.176
He's tall and lanky, swaggering around.

00:31:04.259 --> 00:31:06.470
Anyone could tell
he's up to something scandalous.

00:31:06.553 --> 00:31:08.389
Even so.

00:31:08.472 --> 00:31:11.058
You said Han-gyul's mother passed away.

00:31:11.141 --> 00:31:14.853
There's no way to know
unless you check the family registry.

00:31:14.937 --> 00:31:15.771
Don't you think so?

00:31:17.523 --> 00:31:18.941
Am I right?

00:31:19.024 --> 00:31:20.901
Yes, that makes sense.

00:31:30.119 --> 00:31:32.246
THAT WOMAN

00:31:41.213 --> 00:31:42.172
What?

00:31:43.173 --> 00:31:44.007
What the heck?

00:31:47.261 --> 00:31:48.721
Are you Kim Min-jae?

00:31:49.263 --> 00:31:51.640
Why do you always get in my way?

00:31:58.147 --> 00:31:58.981
"Sorry"?

00:32:01.066 --> 00:32:03.610
Do you have to say sorry
with a Nobel Prize-winning book?

00:32:03.694 --> 00:32:06.071
I'm really sorry for telling the adults.

00:32:06.155 --> 00:32:07.823
I wasn't trying to mess with you.

00:32:07.906 --> 00:32:12.619
I just panicked when I heard
you'd sleep at some guy's house.

00:32:12.703 --> 00:32:13.954
Yeah, sure.

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:16.582
You need me, that's why.

00:32:17.332 --> 00:32:18.167
I need you?

00:32:19.042 --> 00:32:20.878
Our class has 25 students.

00:32:20.961 --> 00:32:23.505
If even one's missing,
you won't get Grade 1.

00:32:24.465 --> 00:32:27.926
You need me beneath you
to keep your top grade safe.

00:32:32.181 --> 00:32:34.516
I know how you can get Grade 1.

00:32:40.272 --> 00:32:41.356
Are you...

00:32:44.109 --> 00:32:44.943
dying?

00:32:46.361 --> 00:32:47.696
If I die, there'll be 24.

00:32:48.906 --> 00:32:50.949
If you want to get Grade 1,
you need me, too.

00:32:51.033 --> 00:32:53.494
How am I supposed to do that?

00:32:53.577 --> 00:32:54.411
You just have to...

00:32:55.871 --> 00:32:56.705
beat me.

00:33:00.709 --> 00:33:03.420
Guess who won Usain Bolt's farewell race?

00:33:04.129 --> 00:33:06.924
Gatlin, the one
who was always second to him.

00:33:08.509 --> 00:33:11.595
Roger Deakins lost the Oscar
for cinematography 13 times

00:33:11.678 --> 00:33:12.930
before winning on the 14th.

00:33:13.514 --> 00:33:15.390
Nobody's second forever.

00:33:15.474 --> 00:33:17.100
You sure can beat me.

00:33:17.184 --> 00:33:19.436
But I just don't know how!

00:33:23.023 --> 00:33:27.027
Here's the stuff most likely on the final.
Start here.

00:33:28.362 --> 00:33:30.489
You're doing this
knowing I can't beat you.

00:33:30.572 --> 00:33:32.366
It's because I want you to beat me.

00:33:32.449 --> 00:33:33.283
Why?

00:33:35.327 --> 00:33:37.329
Why do you want me to beat you?

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:45.838
Go over it.
I'll add the other subjects too.

00:33:47.256 --> 00:33:48.257
Let's go.

00:33:50.884 --> 00:33:53.679
I knew Se-jin and I
were on the same level.

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:56.598
Hermann Hesse's...

00:33:57.099 --> 00:33:59.309
Mian. Wow, it's a masterpiece.

00:33:59.393 --> 00:34:03.522
It's about a wounded soul learning to live
by forgiving others, you know.

00:34:04.398 --> 00:34:06.775
I'm embarrassed we were in the same womb.

00:34:07.359 --> 00:34:08.569
What's this provocation?

00:34:08.652 --> 00:34:11.363
At least learn the title!

00:34:11.446 --> 00:34:14.116
This book is not "Mian," it's "Daemian."

00:34:14.992 --> 00:34:18.579
"Dae" means "super,"
so it means "super sorry."

00:34:23.709 --> 00:34:26.253
So, was the woman
who called him at the hotel

00:34:26.336 --> 00:34:27.880
the same one Miss Seo saw?

00:34:28.755 --> 00:34:32.384
But if Han-gyul is his son,
why would he pretend he's his nephew?

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:36.054
I spent too much time with him.

00:34:37.055 --> 00:34:40.100
It doesn't matter who he is to Han-gyul.
It's none of my business.

00:34:48.233 --> 00:34:50.485
What is he doing over there?

00:34:54.948 --> 00:34:56.116
Oh, my gosh.

00:35:19.389 --> 00:35:22.684
Did he load up on supplements
or take steroids or something?

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:25.646
Why does he get so fired up every night?

00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:34.821
Mr. Sun.

00:35:34.905 --> 00:35:38.951
I've been trying to look the other way
regardless of what you do,

00:35:39.034 --> 00:35:42.371
but as a resident of Shinsu,
I can't really turn a blind eye.

00:35:42.454 --> 00:35:46.083
The drains are city property,
so you shouldn't damage them.

00:35:49.711 --> 00:35:52.798
Goodness, it's big enough
for you to slip an arm in.

00:35:52.881 --> 00:35:54.508
-Is it?
-What?

00:35:54.591 --> 00:35:56.051
Is it big enough?

00:36:19.658 --> 00:36:21.952
Goodness, is it you again?

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:25.455
Now you recognize me.

00:36:25.539 --> 00:36:28.667
Oh, you know this puppy?

00:36:57.696 --> 00:37:00.699
Who left you here?
Were you caught in a landslide?

00:37:02.075 --> 00:37:03.160
I followed your sound.

00:37:03.744 --> 00:37:05.287
It's okay.

00:37:06.163 --> 00:37:09.041
I saved this little guy
during the landslide before.

00:37:17.215 --> 00:37:20.260
Are you lost?
Why are you alone? Come here.

00:37:21.053 --> 00:37:22.429
My goodness.

00:37:23.346 --> 00:37:24.514
Are you okay?

00:37:26.433 --> 00:37:27.267
Wait.

00:37:30.187 --> 00:37:31.855
Looks like it hurt its leg.

00:37:33.565 --> 00:37:36.193
What do we do? Is there a vet nearby?

00:37:54.586 --> 00:37:56.213
Do you have something to dry it off?

00:38:03.595 --> 00:38:05.097
-I do.
-Where?

00:38:07.265 --> 00:38:11.478
PAWS & MEOW ANIMAL CLINIC

00:38:19.945 --> 00:38:21.029
What?

00:38:22.072 --> 00:38:23.365
What's wrong?

00:39:27.637 --> 00:39:32.309
Working the night shift
is finally paying off tonight.

00:39:53.496 --> 00:39:56.082
Why would you take your shirt off
to get it dry?

00:39:56.166 --> 00:39:58.210
It's shaking so much,
who cares about a shirt?

00:39:58.293 --> 00:39:59.127
Still...

00:39:59.211 --> 00:40:01.838
This is a quick-dry shirt,
so it dries quickly.

00:40:02.505 --> 00:40:03.632
Can you treat it?

00:40:03.715 --> 00:40:05.091
Probably.

00:40:07.052 --> 00:40:09.888
Sure, just say the word.
We can do anything for you.

00:40:09.971 --> 00:40:12.641
I think this little one hurt its leg,
please take a look.

00:40:12.724 --> 00:40:14.476
And do a full check-up while we're here.

00:40:15.435 --> 00:40:18.104
The doctor's out birthing a calf.
You'll have to wait a bit.

00:40:19.564 --> 00:40:22.442
Can you fill this out?

00:40:23.318 --> 00:40:25.403
Sure. Go have a seat.

00:40:25.487 --> 00:40:26.488
It's okay.

00:40:58.853 --> 00:41:00.730
Why's it taking so long?

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:17.038
There's no need to hide it.

00:41:19.624 --> 00:41:21.835
Scars aren't always a bad thing.

00:41:22.919 --> 00:41:25.171
They're proof of what you've endured.

00:41:35.181 --> 00:41:36.308
Excuse me.

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:38.268
You're Han-gyul's dad, right?

00:41:39.644 --> 00:41:42.772
Oh, he's Han-gyul's uncle, not his dad.

00:41:42.856 --> 00:41:45.150
What? Yes, he is.

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.778
You are Han-gyul's dad.

00:41:52.824 --> 00:41:55.493
I've checked all the paperwork.

00:41:57.078 --> 00:41:59.289
Paperwork? What do you mean?

00:42:04.252 --> 00:42:06.254
Say something, Mr. Sun.

00:42:06.338 --> 00:42:11.134
She's saying you're Han-gyul's dad
and not his uncle.

00:42:14.637 --> 00:42:15.555
She's right.

00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:18.266
I am...

00:42:21.269 --> 00:42:22.354
Han-gyul's father.

00:42:25.523 --> 00:42:28.068
His uncle is... his dad?

00:42:50.507 --> 00:42:51.341
What?

00:42:52.008 --> 00:42:53.343
Take the umbrella.

00:42:56.846 --> 00:43:00.308
If you catch a cold from the rain,
you can't do well on the finals.

00:43:01.267 --> 00:43:02.185
Why?

00:43:03.144 --> 00:43:05.772
Worried your grade will drop
if your pacemaker gives up?

00:43:07.941 --> 00:43:10.485
If I take this, how will you get home?

00:43:10.568 --> 00:43:12.946
I'd still beat you
even if I get rained on.

00:43:20.203 --> 00:43:21.246
Share it with me.

00:43:25.291 --> 00:43:27.794
If I beat you like this,
what will everyone think?

00:43:27.877 --> 00:43:31.256
They'll think I only won
because Evil Han-gyul caught a cold.

00:43:33.216 --> 00:43:34.676
It's too small. You take it.

00:43:41.307 --> 00:43:43.810
You can't get
a single drop of rain on you.

00:43:43.893 --> 00:43:45.437
That's how we keep it fair.

00:43:46.646 --> 00:43:50.442
Stay healthy no matter what
until the exams.

00:43:51.151 --> 00:43:53.236
Understand? That's an order.

00:44:23.308 --> 00:44:24.893
AWARD CERTIFICATE

00:44:26.769 --> 00:44:27.812
FILIAL PIETY AWARD

00:44:31.274 --> 00:44:32.442
AWARD CERTIFICATE

00:44:32.525 --> 00:44:34.027
It must have been hard...

00:44:37.113 --> 00:44:38.156
for Se-jin.

00:44:39.991 --> 00:44:43.620
So, you came to give me a hard time?

00:44:49.667 --> 00:44:51.544
You're holding up better than I expected.

00:44:52.128 --> 00:44:57.342
I even filed a fake complaint
just to find where you are.

00:45:00.678 --> 00:45:01.513
Here.

00:45:04.098 --> 00:45:06.100
You went through all that trouble
to find me.

00:45:06.684 --> 00:45:07.560
This is why, right?

00:45:08.561 --> 00:45:10.104
It's three times as much as before.

00:45:11.731 --> 00:45:15.818
I figured I'd give it back someday,
so I put it in the same box.

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:19.155
It came in handy, thanks.

00:45:21.699 --> 00:45:22.700
So, you think...

00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:26.287
I spent ten years...

00:45:28.581 --> 00:45:29.624
looking for you...

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.670
because of money?

00:45:36.172 --> 00:45:38.258
What else do you want from me
other than money?

00:45:41.719 --> 00:45:42.720
An apology.

00:45:44.931 --> 00:45:45.848
An apology?

00:45:48.768 --> 00:45:49.686
There's no apology.

00:45:50.979 --> 00:45:52.689
Money is all you'll get from me.

00:45:53.481 --> 00:45:54.816
Tell me if you want more.

00:46:19.841 --> 00:46:23.428
Evil Han-gyul thinks I'm a joke.

00:46:23.511 --> 00:46:25.471
He gave me his notebook this morning,

00:46:25.555 --> 00:46:27.807
and now an umbrella
like I'm a charity case.

00:46:28.349 --> 00:46:32.395
He's looking down on me
because my grades suck, right?

00:46:32.937 --> 00:46:37.275
I wanted to forgive him,
but I want to take revenge now.

00:46:38.901 --> 00:46:39.736
Tell me about it.

00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:42.697
Are you throwing money away?

00:46:43.489 --> 00:46:45.450
I'll recycle it, then.

00:46:45.533 --> 00:46:46.492
No.

00:46:47.827 --> 00:46:49.454
Leave it. I'll take it back later.

00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:55.168
This is just a performance
to vent my rage.

00:46:59.297 --> 00:47:00.340
Se-jin...

00:47:01.382 --> 00:47:02.925
you wanted to beat Han-gyul, right?

00:47:03.009 --> 00:47:04.385
I want to crush him.

00:47:04.469 --> 00:47:07.889
There's someone from that family
I'd love to crush, too.

00:47:09.182 --> 00:47:10.058
Han-gyul's uncle?

00:47:12.268 --> 00:47:14.437
-Team up?
-Absolutely.

00:47:15.855 --> 00:47:16.773
By the way...

00:47:17.315 --> 00:47:20.860
if we're going to work together,
don't you need to come to Shinsu?

00:47:20.943 --> 00:47:23.237
I need your help to beat Evil Han-gyul.

00:47:25.823 --> 00:47:28.368
I'm doing this to steal first place.

00:47:29.619 --> 00:47:30.453
But what about you?

00:47:31.204 --> 00:47:33.247
What are you planning to take
from his uncle?

00:47:45.885 --> 00:47:47.136
So the rumor about you...

00:47:48.554 --> 00:47:51.265
being Han-gyul's dad was true?

00:47:54.185 --> 00:47:57.105
That rumor... got out?

00:47:58.439 --> 00:48:00.650
There's no way it could have.

00:48:02.402 --> 00:48:05.321
Otherwise, how would she know?
She said she checked the paperwork.

00:48:08.074 --> 00:48:08.950
Take a look.

00:48:15.123 --> 00:48:17.500
PET CHECK-IN FORM

00:48:17.583 --> 00:48:21.504
NAME: HAN-GYUL
DAD: SUN JAE-GYU, MOM: YOON BOM

00:48:23.256 --> 00:48:25.007
Confirm that and then come in.

00:48:25.091 --> 00:48:26.342
Sure.

00:48:30.763 --> 00:48:32.849
When did you fill this in?

00:48:33.808 --> 00:48:35.101
And why am I its mom?

00:48:35.184 --> 00:48:36.310
Then are you the dad?

00:48:37.937 --> 00:48:40.273
Even so, how could you write "Han-gyul"?

00:48:40.982 --> 00:48:44.068
Who in their right mind
names a random dog after their nephew?

00:48:44.569 --> 00:48:48.156
She suddenly asked me to write a name.
That's all I could think of.

00:48:49.490 --> 00:48:52.034
If you don't like it,
you can come up with something.

00:48:56.706 --> 00:48:59.792
See? I knew it.
You're drawing a blank, too, right?

00:49:00.418 --> 00:49:01.252
Geez.

00:49:04.297 --> 00:49:07.467
If you don't like Han-gyul,
let's go with Bom-sik.

00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:09.802
Bom-sik, Yoon Bom's son. Nice.

00:49:09.886 --> 00:49:11.053
What if it's a girl?

00:49:11.137 --> 00:49:12.680
-It's a boy.
-Goodness.

00:49:15.224 --> 00:49:17.560
Han-gyul's mom and dad, please come in.

00:49:17.643 --> 00:49:19.395
We just changed his name.

00:49:20.062 --> 00:49:22.398
It's Bom-sik. Let's go, Bom-sik.

00:49:29.697 --> 00:49:33.534
Other than the small bruise,
there are no fractures or major problems,

00:49:33.618 --> 00:49:37.580
but due to poor nutrition,
he's showing signs of low blood sugar.

00:49:37.663 --> 00:49:40.124
If he gets IV fluids and some rest,
he should be fine.

00:49:41.834 --> 00:49:43.628
So, what happens to him from here on?

00:49:45.338 --> 00:49:49.342
We also take in stray animals,
so you can leave him with us...

00:49:50.259 --> 00:49:51.719
but he doesn't have a chip,

00:49:51.803 --> 00:49:53.846
so we need to put up a notice
to find the owner.

00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:56.098
What if the owner doesn't turn up?

00:49:58.059 --> 00:49:59.852
If no one shows up in ten days...

00:50:01.062 --> 00:50:03.981
What, are you saying you'd put him down?

00:50:06.234 --> 00:50:07.109
No.

00:50:07.193 --> 00:50:11.739
If the owner doesn't turn up,
please let us know. Please.

00:50:13.658 --> 00:50:16.661
We will. Don't worry and go eat something.

00:50:21.207 --> 00:50:22.124
He's perfectly fine.

00:50:23.918 --> 00:50:24.877
Open your eyes.

00:50:27.672 --> 00:50:29.048
Come in, honey.

00:50:30.007 --> 00:50:31.217
What did you just call me?

00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:34.804
You're Bom-sik's mom and I'm his dad.

00:50:34.887 --> 00:50:37.932
That makes us a couple, doesn't it?

00:50:38.891 --> 00:50:39.725
Honey.

00:50:40.351 --> 00:50:41.561
Welcome.

00:50:42.562 --> 00:50:43.688
My goodness.

00:50:43.771 --> 00:50:46.899
Oh, my. You came with your wife today.

00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:50.152
I'm not his wife. I'm his kid's teacher.

00:50:50.236 --> 00:50:51.571
What would you like?

00:50:53.531 --> 00:50:55.992
Everything's made of flour here.

00:50:56.617 --> 00:50:58.953
Ma'am, don't you have something healthy?

00:50:59.036 --> 00:51:02.623
My goodness.
You take really good care of your wife.

00:51:02.707 --> 00:51:03.875
I'm jealous.

00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:08.462
Our kid hurt his leg,
so my wife hasn't had a single bite.

00:51:08.546 --> 00:51:09.672
She's been starving.

00:51:09.755 --> 00:51:10.590
Poor thing.

00:51:10.673 --> 00:51:13.801
How could a mom even eat
when her kid is sick?

00:51:13.885 --> 00:51:15.469
-How many kids?
-One.

00:51:15.553 --> 00:51:16.971
-A girl?
-A boy.

00:51:17.054 --> 00:51:19.473
Oh, dear. Then you better have a daughter.

00:51:20.016 --> 00:51:23.644
Sons are a pain to raise.
They just cause problems.

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:26.063
My point exactly.

00:51:26.147 --> 00:51:29.817
I've been pushing for one more kid.
She's been saying no.

00:51:29.901 --> 00:51:32.403
Excuse me,
aren't you going to take our order?

00:51:32.486 --> 00:51:33.487
Hold on.

00:51:33.571 --> 00:51:36.324
I made some beef bone broth
during the day.

00:51:36.407 --> 00:51:41.787
I'll whip up a hearty dumpling soup
especially for your wife.

00:51:41.871 --> 00:51:43.205
It'll give you some strength,

00:51:43.289 --> 00:51:45.583
so have a girl with your husband.

00:51:46.125 --> 00:51:47.001
Okay?

00:51:47.752 --> 00:51:49.420
Geez.

00:52:13.361 --> 00:52:14.820
Are you free tomorrow evening?

00:52:15.446 --> 00:52:17.490
Do you want to check out
my workplace again?

00:52:17.573 --> 00:52:19.158
As long as Han-gyul's free.

00:52:20.117 --> 00:52:21.369
Han-gyul's not coming.

00:52:24.538 --> 00:52:25.498
Let's meet, just us.

00:52:27.917 --> 00:52:29.043
Just the two of us?

00:52:31.212 --> 00:52:32.213
Let's have a drink.

00:52:41.472 --> 00:52:42.848
No way. Unbelievable.

00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:45.476
Are you serious?

00:52:46.102 --> 00:52:47.853
No, wait.

00:52:47.937 --> 00:52:50.523
So, the girl you're interested in

00:52:50.606 --> 00:52:54.193
asked you out for drinks tonight?
Alone, just the two of you?

00:52:55.069 --> 00:52:57.238
She's not someone I'm interested in.

00:52:57.321 --> 00:52:58.739
She's just someone I know.

00:52:58.823 --> 00:53:00.074
Either way,

00:53:00.157 --> 00:53:02.660
she must've asked you
because she's interested in you.

00:53:03.577 --> 00:53:05.454
I guess she's in the mood for a drink.

00:53:06.038 --> 00:53:07.456
You really have no clue, do you?

00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:10.626
You think "Want to stay for coffee?"
actually means coffee?

00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:13.546
You think "Want to rest a bit?"
means just rest?

00:53:14.672 --> 00:53:15.798
Wait a minute.

00:53:16.382 --> 00:53:19.260
You haven't been
taking everything she said

00:53:19.343 --> 00:53:21.679
literally like that, have you?

00:53:25.975 --> 00:53:28.352
"Why do you take everything literally?"

00:53:29.854 --> 00:53:31.063
She did say that to me.

00:53:31.147 --> 00:53:32.606
So you have been doing that.

00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:34.191
See? So, listen.

00:53:35.276 --> 00:53:38.487
You should've noticed
the tone of her voice

00:53:38.571 --> 00:53:39.989
and the nuances in her actions.

00:53:43.659 --> 00:53:44.577
Come here.

00:53:46.996 --> 00:53:48.039
That brat.

00:53:55.671 --> 00:53:56.505
Here.

00:53:57.631 --> 00:53:58.549
Boss.

00:54:10.936 --> 00:54:12.688
Wait, it's so good.

00:54:13.522 --> 00:54:14.356
Have some, boss.

00:54:24.742 --> 00:54:27.828
Nuances...
How am I supposed to figure those out?

00:54:30.414 --> 00:54:34.251
When you saw her, how was she dressed?

00:54:35.211 --> 00:54:39.256
It kind of looked like
she put in extra effort, right?

00:54:40.424 --> 00:54:44.470
Didn't she wear a light, fluttery dress
with her hair nicely done?

00:54:44.553 --> 00:54:46.597
She always looks ready for a funeral.

00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:50.935
Doesn't she smile constantly
and find you funny?

00:54:51.018 --> 00:54:53.270
She always clenches her jaw tightly.

00:54:53.354 --> 00:54:55.189
Doesn't she give compliments over nothing?

00:54:55.272 --> 00:54:56.941
She loves to nitpick and complain.

00:54:57.024 --> 00:55:00.569
No, I'm sure she must've given you clues,
but you didn't catch any.

00:55:00.653 --> 00:55:01.570
Then...

00:55:02.321 --> 00:55:04.115
look carefully from now on.

00:55:05.324 --> 00:55:07.076
"Let's have a drink."

00:55:07.159 --> 00:55:12.540
It's definitely an approval.

00:55:36.355 --> 00:55:37.356
That's nonsense.

00:55:38.107 --> 00:55:40.067
What approval?

00:55:45.281 --> 00:55:47.283
There's no need to hide it.

00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:53.080
Scars aren't always a bad thing.

00:55:54.081 --> 00:55:55.916
They're proof of what you've endured.

00:56:13.559 --> 00:56:16.103
Is it the coffee I had?
Why is my heart racing?

00:56:18.439 --> 00:56:19.523
Jae-gyu!

00:56:28.449 --> 00:56:33.579
She looked like she put in
extra effort to look nice, right?

00:57:08.113 --> 00:57:08.989
Open up.

00:57:12.743 --> 00:57:14.787
-Do you need handyman work?
-No.

00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:16.497
-Do you need to move heavy stuff?
-No.

00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:20.125
Is there someone to take care of, then?

00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:21.835
No, not at all.

00:57:21.919 --> 00:57:23.963
It's nothing like that, so stop glaring.

00:57:25.965 --> 00:57:26.840
Open up.

00:57:26.924 --> 00:57:30.761
Then why are you suddenly
making a wrap for me I wonder.

00:57:31.845 --> 00:57:33.222
-Forget it then.
-Here.

00:57:36.225 --> 00:57:37.101
Open up.

00:57:42.398 --> 00:57:44.316
How is it? Is it good?

00:57:47.528 --> 00:57:49.697
It tastes good, but...

00:57:50.739 --> 00:57:52.658
it feels like it might not sit well.

00:57:56.578 --> 00:57:57.413
Wait.

00:58:36.285 --> 00:58:37.161
That's better.

00:58:39.246 --> 00:58:40.706
Shall we have a drink?

00:58:42.499 --> 00:58:43.625
Cheers!

00:58:46.879 --> 00:58:47.713
Cheers.

00:59:08.025 --> 00:59:11.820
IF YOU DRINK THIS,
WE'LL BECOME A COUPLE

00:59:20.162 --> 00:59:21.330
Nuances.

00:59:22.623 --> 00:59:23.582
Nuances.

00:59:23.665 --> 00:59:24.541
Right.

00:59:25.209 --> 00:59:29.922
Green Narae has decided to visit
the company you work for,

00:59:30.005 --> 00:59:31.673
so make sure you're ready.

00:59:31.757 --> 00:59:32.591
Really?

00:59:33.550 --> 00:59:34.468
No preliminary visit?

00:59:35.260 --> 00:59:37.304
After spending some time with you...

00:59:37.930 --> 00:59:40.516
I can tell you're trustworthy
and righteous.

00:59:41.350 --> 00:59:43.435
There's no reason
not to visit your company.

00:59:44.603 --> 00:59:45.854
Well, wait.

00:59:47.815 --> 00:59:49.733
She gives compliments over nothing.

00:59:53.779 --> 00:59:55.197
You see...

00:59:58.242 --> 01:00:01.620
I think I know why you're like this.

01:00:04.248 --> 01:00:05.416
Did you know?

01:00:10.754 --> 01:00:12.631
Do you...

01:00:18.262 --> 01:00:19.138
Well...

01:00:20.389 --> 01:00:21.265
Do you...

01:00:23.350 --> 01:00:25.227
Miss Bom, do you...

01:00:39.741 --> 01:00:40.659
You're right.

01:01:54.858 --> 01:01:58.654
I thought about
why I kept letting you get to me.

01:01:59.321 --> 01:02:00.489
Hide.

01:02:00.572 --> 01:02:02.324
There's Camil Coffee on Rodeo Street.

01:02:02.407 --> 01:02:04.326
That's my favorite coffee shop.

01:02:04.409 --> 01:02:05.619
She has no clue how I feel.

01:02:05.702 --> 01:02:07.454
Who's he going to beat up today?

01:02:07.538 --> 01:02:11.667
Medals for everyone
on the winning team, yes or no?

01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:12.584
Yes!

01:02:12.668 --> 01:02:15.087
Bom-sik, I'll get the medal for you.

01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:17.714
Make sure everyone's ready, okay?

01:02:18.632 --> 01:02:19.841
The homeroom teacher!

01:02:26.723 --> 01:02:28.725
