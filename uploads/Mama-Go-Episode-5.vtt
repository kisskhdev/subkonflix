WEBVTT

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.719
You took a leave of absence.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.159
Kong Xiaocan.

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:38.719
You've really grown wings now.

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:42.000
Did you discuss such a big thing with me?

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:45.520
Your major is great for the civil service exams in the future.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.079
You were already later than other kids...

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.159
...when starting school.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.679
You don't cherish such a good opportunity.

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:50.520
What do you want to do?

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.759
Can you face yourself?

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:52.880
I'm afraid of letting you down.

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:55.880
You chose the school.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.759
You chose the major.

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.840
That lousy major.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.000
I don't like it at all.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Besides, what era is this?

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.960
It's not like I have to go to college, so what?

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.439
I have to do what I like.

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:04.799
It's a good chance for me to really think.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.239
About what I want to do in the future.

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:06.920
Find my future.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.239
As long as you go to school properly.

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:09.640
You can do whatever you want in the future.

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.200
Did I try to control you when you went to the snow mountain?

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.200
What else do you want to do?

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.359
Mom, you... calm down first.

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.680
Right now...

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.079
I'm taking a leave of absence.

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.480
It's not dropping out of school.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.799
I'm just a year late.

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.680
Being a year late gives me time to think.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.079
"I'll reflect a bit." "If you're a year late..."

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:24.439
If you're a year late, you'll fall far behind others.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.519
If I had these conditions back then...

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:27.480
You have them now!

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.439
You have them now!

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:30.719
Not going to school is your regret.

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:31.480
Not mine.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.560
Everyone has their own aspirations.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.680
You have this opportunity now.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.519
Go fulfill your dream properly.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.280
Go to college properly.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.680
I don't want to affect your mood.

00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:37.920
This is my own life now.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.840
Let me make my own decisions.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.159
Can't I think for myself?

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.319
Your own life?

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:43.840
I gave birth to you.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.400
What do you mean "your own life"?

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.840
But aren't I doing this for both of us?

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.799
I'm also doing this for your own good.

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:48.760
I'm your Mom.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.799
I'm also doing this for your own good.

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:51.239
I'm just doing this for your own good.

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:52.519
You have to listen to me.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.640
Are you guys fighting?

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.920
Wei Mingtian, I'm not going over the wrong answers today.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.439
You go back.

00:01:58.879 --> 00:01:59.599
You come in. Come in.

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:00.519
You two focus on correcting your mistakes.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.079
Don't mind us.

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.879
Kong Xiaocan, do you have to... in front of an outsider...

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.920
...argue about this matter?

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:04.760
In front of an outsider...

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.920
Can you stop being so agitated?

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.760
Fine.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.480
It's no big deal.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.680
The sky isn't falling, okay?

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.639
I can't control you anymore.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:11.919
Where's the card? Where is it?

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.840
Give it to me. What are you doing? What are you doing?

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.800
Is this the issue?

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:14.840
How is this not the issue?

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.759
Let me just tell you one thing.

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:17.560
You took a leave of absence just to make money, right?

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.719
Is it because I got sick...

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:20.120
...and spent all the family's money?

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.800
Speak up.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.960
If you want to go to school...

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.879
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.360
I didn't want this to affect your mood.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.439
I still want you to go to school.

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:26.280
I'm also doing this for your own good.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.400
I want you to become successful.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.159
I want you to be well.

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:28.759
Then I'm also doing this for your own good.

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:29.719
I want you to go to school.

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:31.360
I'm also doing this for both of us, right?

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:33.319
We don't have any financial problems.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.520
You calm down.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.639
How can I calm down? I'm doing this for your own good.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.360
Everyone calm down for a second.

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:38.599
Let's talk things over calmly.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.319
Hello? Brother Maizi.

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:45.120
Hello? Who is this?

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.840
Looking for a parent.

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:01.039
So here's the situation.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.879
If he wants to improve his grades,

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.639
he needs to make time to start from the basics.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.879
But with our current curriculum schedule,

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.639
he clearly doesn't have enough time.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.120
Yes, Teacher.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.080
You know, well...

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:17.680
Mingtian, this kid...

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.520
has special circumstances.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.319
For him right now,

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.400
it is indeed the most critical time.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.919
Right.

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:24.120
Time is money.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.439
Right.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.879
So,

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.840
don't you think this makes sense?

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:31.199
All roads lead to Rome.

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:33.319
Studying is just one of them.

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:35.199
The main thing is that this kid...

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.919
is already in Rome.

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:40.680
In... where?

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.439
The main purpose of my chat today...

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:44.120
is just this.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.919
Do you think you could...

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.439
approve another week of leave for the kid?

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.479
We need a "Roman Holiday" right now.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.759
Teacher.

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.439
He is in the final sprint phase.

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:57.159
Yes, yes, yes.

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:58.719
I'm talking to you about time,

00:03:58.719 --> 00:03:59.800
and you're asking for a holiday for him.

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:00.800
And a "Roman Holiday" at that.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.319
Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thanks for understanding.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.800
Excuse me.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.280
I need to take a call.

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:06.840
No... Hello? Hello? Mr. Wu.

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:14.479
You... you take... hold this tight.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.759
You have to be my witness.

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:16.959
I didn't... I didn't accept anything.

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:18.079
What... what kind of guardian is this?

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:20.879
He...

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.680
He is Brother Maizi.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.480
I told you to find a parent.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.160
You brought me a "brother" from the streets.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.759
Look at his attitude.

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.079
Sorry, Teacher. I'm late.

00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:35.000
And what is your attitude?

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:36.240
Scoring second to last.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.360
And you have the nerve to sit down?

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:41.040
No, guard... guardian.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.959
Guard... guardians can sit.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.160
Okay.

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:45.319
You... you are?

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:46.000
I'm her brother.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.920
Also a "brother" from the streets?

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.839
Cousin. A real relative.

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:53.319
Then I didn't... I didn't mishear just now?

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:55.839
I thought, second place? Is she that good?

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.639
Second to last.

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:00.879
I knew it.

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:03.920
So there are... there are people who did worse than her?

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.240
Keep it up.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.920
Th-this time, we're not here to discuss...

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.439
who is last or who is second to last.

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:13.720
I wanted to talk to you about...

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.639
the scores are out.

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.959
This time...

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.600
she scored 350 points.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.800
That's not bad.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.920
350 is pretty high.

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:22.199
Our province's vocational college admission line is 351.

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:28.040
The main thing is, she can't get into Duxing U with this.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.399
She's short by two... two or three hundred points.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.040
You want to get into Duxing U too?

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.279
I'm not taking the exam.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.160
No, you...

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.079
Why are you saying such angry things, child?

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.519
We brought the guardian here so the school...

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:38.000
isn't it just so we can...

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.439
find a solution?

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:40.079
Right?

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:42.399
And haven't our grades improved a bit?

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.920
Exactly.

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:44.079
Before, you were dead last.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.199
Through your own hard work...

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:45.879
now you're second to last.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.360
See?

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:47.360
If you work a little harder...

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.639
you'll be third to last, fourth to last.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:49.920
We take it step by step.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.160
Look how well the teacher put it.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.439
The main purpose of this visit...

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:54.000
is to have the guardian's side...

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.480
Understood.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.079
play a supervisory role.

00:05:56.079 --> 00:05:56.759
Definitely, definitely, Teacher.

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:58.120
We should work together.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.639
Right.

00:05:58.759 --> 00:05:59.720
What does the child want? Right now...

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:00.680
I'm not taking the exam.

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:01.759
I want to drop out of school.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.000
I want to work. I want to make money.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.959
I want to support the family myself.

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:07.720
This student makes a good point.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.279
Teacher, everyone has their own path.

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:12.519
If she doesn't want to study, don't force it.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.120
How about this? Our Xiaotian dropped out of school too.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.519
Sorry, let me take this call.

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:20.079
Hello? Hello, President Wu.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.399
Call your parents here.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.480
Treating your studies like a joke.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.000
Teacher, I won't drop out of school.

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:26.680
I want to take the college entrance exam. I can definitely pass.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.319
That's the right attitude.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.240
I want to drop out of school.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.439
If I can get in...

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:31.360
then pigs can fly.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.439
Call your dad here.

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:35.399
My grandpa passed away.

00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:37.040
I said her dad.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.920
You...

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:40.600
What kind of guardians are these?

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.000
Boss.

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:52.360
You're hiring here, right?

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:54.439
I don't hire part-timers here.

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:55.480
I need someone long-term.

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:56.439
I can work long-term.

00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:59.160
You're a student, right?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.079
This work isn't easy.

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:02.399
You'll definitely leave after a bit.

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:05.319
Besides, even if you came, I couldn't take you.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.480
You're a student. Studies come first.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.759
You still need to study.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.480
Boss, you're so right. You have vision.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:12.879
Miss! Miss!

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.639
We're hiring over here.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.279
Look, this fits your age perfectly.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.120
Our salary is 3,500 a month.

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:20.920
Most importantly, there's commission.

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:22.120
You've graduated, right?

00:07:22.519 --> 00:07:24.240
Then you must know how to make spreadsheets and slides.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.720
Here, a college student...

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:27.720
...will surely be a store manager in six months.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.360
How about it? Think it over.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.600
Think it over.

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:31.560
Get into college first.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:32.680
You don't even know spreadsheets.

00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:35.839
Do you see that?

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:37.480
College students are everywhere now.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.439
Don't even talk about college students.

00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:39.920
Everyone has to struggle to find a job now.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.160
Do you think you can make it without school?

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.079
Then what's the point of me studying?

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:43.839
My life is already set.

00:07:44.079 --> 00:07:44.839
But you're different.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.319
You haven't finished college yet.

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:47.319
How will you find a job later?

00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:47.720
So what?

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.920
So going to college is just to find a job?

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.680
Of course not.

00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:51.920
I hope you can have a good life.

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:53.959
What era is this? "A good life"?

00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:55.079
I know what a good life is.

00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:56.360
Everyone's path to success is different.

00:07:56.439 --> 00:07:57.199
It doesn't have to be college.

00:07:57.279 --> 00:07:58.160
But you're different.

00:07:58.439 --> 00:07:59.519
Your priority now is school.

00:07:59.519 --> 00:08:00.319
So you have to go to school.

00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:00.759
Bullshit.

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:12.600
Okay, okay. Come back.

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:13.920
Kong Guifang, listen to me.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.680
Let me break it down for you.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.439
Okay, you go now.

00:08:17.439 --> 00:08:18.399
No matter which shop you go to.

00:08:18.399 --> 00:08:18.959
You go work.

00:08:19.399 --> 00:08:20.240
Starting now, it'll be like this.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.480
For the next ten years, this will be your life.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:21.879
Raising me.

00:08:22.439 --> 00:08:22.839
And then?

00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:23.680
After I get married and have kids...

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.759
...you have to earn money and support me, right?

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.199
Do you know what happens when you're forty?

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.360
You'll get pancreatic cancer again.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.360
That's probably because you pissed me off.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.279
So don't get pissed off by me.

00:08:29.279 --> 00:08:30.399
Live for yourself for once, okay?

00:08:30.519 --> 00:08:32.000
That life of yours is already clear to see.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:32.559
You have another chance.

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:33.679
Why not choose again?

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.600
Then what about your future?

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:35.879
What will happen to your future?

00:08:37.399 --> 00:08:38.960
I didn't say I won't go to school.

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:40.080
But I just feel...

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.159
...now isn't the time for school.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:41.840
Now isn't the time.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.360
When is the time?

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:42.840
You tell me.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:43.879
What do you want to do now?

00:08:43.879 --> 00:08:44.559
You want to be the death of me?

00:08:44.559 --> 00:08:45.320
I want to earn money to support the family.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.000
It used to be Mom earning money for my school.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.559
Now I want to earn money for Mom's school.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.039
Guifang

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.240
If you keep watering it

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.759
it's going to drown

00:09:46.159 --> 00:09:46.679
Guifang

00:09:48.879 --> 00:09:49.840
are you really not taking the exam?

00:09:53.879 --> 00:09:54.519
Why?

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:57.720
Because

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:00.879
no money

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.399
Xiaocan took a leave of absence to support the family

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.759
entirely because of me

00:10:09.399 --> 00:10:10.399
I can't just for myself

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.960
sacrifice his future

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:12.519
Do you understand?

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.879
Forget it, you definitely don't understand

00:10:18.039 --> 00:10:18.919
You don't have kids

00:10:21.039 --> 00:10:22.519
I don't understand what you're saying

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.039
I just think

00:10:26.159 --> 00:10:27.120
it's a pity

00:10:28.799 --> 00:10:29.960
If it were me

00:10:30.759 --> 00:10:31.440
no matter what

00:10:33.639 --> 00:10:35.039
I would definitely continue school

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:39.919
Our Spotlight Entertainment Agency

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.240
in this industry

00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:43.320
has a great reputation

00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:44.799
And you

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.919
surely have your own connections

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.320
You can ask around

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.159
To be honest

00:10:51.039 --> 00:10:51.840
Connections? I...

00:10:52.399 --> 00:10:53.720
Who is that? I don't know him

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.799
Look, sir

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.559
let me just ask you

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.399
Go ahead

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.399
He just stands there

00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:02.039
and you give money?

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.559
For what?

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.200
In this world

00:11:05.679 --> 00:11:06.440
there is no lack of beauty

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.320
just a lack of eyes to discover it

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.039
Look at him

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.519
Regular features

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.039
tall and thin

00:11:14.679 --> 00:11:15.840
with innocent eyes

00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:17.639
God is feeding him

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.519
How would God know him?

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.279
It's his parents who feed him

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.240
Yes, yes, you're right, you're right

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.320
If you are willing

00:11:24.919 --> 00:11:25.720
to sign this contract

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.440
at the end of every year

00:11:28.879 --> 00:11:29.679
I'll give you this amount

00:11:33.279 --> 00:11:35.120
Five thousand? No way

00:11:36.919 --> 00:11:38.080
Five thousand

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.320
Uncle, you're making this hard for me

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:43.639
How about this

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:44.720
Ten thousand

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.600
Ten thousand, you...

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.120
Twenty thousand

00:11:47.879 --> 00:11:48.320
Deal

00:11:50.559 --> 00:11:51.639
Such a big thing

00:11:52.399 --> 00:11:53.879
and you don't discuss it with Mingtian's mom

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.240
just decided like that?

00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:57.080
Alright, alright

00:11:57.159 --> 00:11:58.759
It's like a pie falling from the sky

00:11:59.399 --> 00:12:01.279
I'm suddenly going to the city to be a star

00:12:01.399 --> 00:12:02.240
Do I press this or not?

00:12:02.519 --> 00:12:03.919
No need, no need to press. You keep it

00:12:04.039 --> 00:12:04.559
Here's the money

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.679
Xiaotian, come, your turn

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.000
Come, come press your fingerprint

00:12:09.879 --> 00:12:10.159
Come

00:12:11.679 --> 00:12:12.240
Press your fingerprint

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.320
Press it next to your dad's

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.519
That twenty thousand is for my dad

00:12:16.039 --> 00:12:16.799
I need a separate deal

00:12:18.159 --> 00:12:19.879
I can go to the big city and work for you

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:21.440
but I want to go to school

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:26.919
I want to go to college

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:38.639
Okay

00:12:39.919 --> 00:12:40.679
Bro will send you to college

00:12:42.519 --> 00:12:44.240
I don't care about being a star

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.600
There's only one thing I want to do

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.200
and that is to go to college

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.200
Actually, I know

00:12:52.519 --> 00:12:54.440
pies don't just fall from the sky for no reason

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.960
but that was a rare opportunity

00:12:59.559 --> 00:13:01.600
Seizing the chance to do what you want

00:13:02.279 --> 00:13:03.399
I think is the most important thing

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:06.519
Guifang

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.240
what do you think is the most important?

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:15.879
It's Xiaocan

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.039
That's right

00:13:19.919 --> 00:13:20.440
It's Xiaocan

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Don't say I didn't warn you

00:13:39.639 --> 00:13:40.639
If you don't fix this soon

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.600
you might regret it for the rest of your life

00:13:50.039 --> 00:13:51.720
What is truly the most important?

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.320
Was my choice wrong?

00:14:38.039 --> 00:14:38.919
He ran off.

00:14:39.759 --> 00:14:40.919
Wages haven't been paid yet.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.639
All that work for nothing.

00:15:10.279 --> 00:15:10.679
Coming.

00:15:13.639 --> 00:15:14.519
Brother Xiaocan.

00:15:18.679 --> 00:15:19.159
Come in.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:25.200
Studying?

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.000
I'm not disturbing you, am I?

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:27.720
It's fine.

00:15:28.279 --> 00:15:29.600
Read for two hours and still don't get it.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.320
Was just about to take a break when you came.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.159
You don't get it but still read for two hours?

00:15:33.159 --> 00:15:34.120
I wouldn't last two minutes.

00:15:35.399 --> 00:15:36.480
Someone as obedient as you...

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.799
...is definitely the type my mom likes.

00:15:38.559 --> 00:15:38.919
A son.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:39.639
That kind of son.

00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:41.559
My mom would probably like someone like you.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.600
Strong and energetic.

00:15:43.879 --> 00:15:44.639
Hardworking.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.840
Full of energy all day long.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:47.720
Unlike me.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.360
Whenever there's work...

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.240
...I make excuses to sneak off and study.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.000
My mom says I'm just...

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.279
...full of excuses.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.279
Right? See, all moms are the same.

00:16:09.399 --> 00:16:10.000
Xiaocan.

00:16:12.039 --> 00:16:13.080
Do you want me to

00:16:13.559 --> 00:16:14.600
help you talk some sense into Guifang?

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:16.320
You really

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.200
catch on fast.

00:16:19.879 --> 00:16:20.600
Let me put it this way.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:21.960
Take my cousin for example.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.039
She's going through a rebellious phase right now.

00:16:24.399 --> 00:16:25.279
As her cousin,

00:16:25.879 --> 00:16:26.600
and as her guardian,

00:16:26.879 --> 00:16:28.080
at her young age,

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.639
she's prone to being a bit rebellious.

00:16:29.879 --> 00:16:31.240
Sometimes she just contradicts whatever I say.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.879
I can't really hold it against a kid.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.600
But for people your age,

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:36.919
outsiders,

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:37.559
wouldn't she be

00:16:38.279 --> 00:16:39.200
easier to communicate with?

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.200
You could understand

00:16:41.519 --> 00:16:41.960
each other, right?

00:16:42.679 --> 00:16:43.559
As an elder,

00:16:43.799 --> 00:16:44.679
I just feel like I...

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:47.440
should ask you...

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.120
to help me.

00:16:50.759 --> 00:16:51.279
Xiaocan.

00:16:52.039 --> 00:16:53.000
Then let me ask you one thing.

00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:55.480
What do you think is the most important,

00:16:56.039 --> 00:16:58.440
the single most important thing to you right now?

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.080
The most important...

00:17:02.279 --> 00:17:03.600
The most important thing...

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.240
is my mom, of course.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.240
Come to think of it,

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:14.200
Mom seems to have always just looked like a mom.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.599
Wait a second, Mom is coming right away.

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:20.000
Be a good boy, Xiaocan.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:22.599
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:23.400
Don't cry.

00:17:23.799 --> 00:17:24.200
Don't cry.

00:17:24.799 --> 00:17:26.440
I'll blow on it and the pain will fly away. Don't cry.

00:17:28.799 --> 00:17:31.200
Mom, I want to eat ribs.

00:17:31.799 --> 00:17:33.200
Mom already cooked for you at home.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.000
We're not eating this.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:34.880
Come on, let's go home.

00:17:41.359 --> 00:17:42.599
She has always been busy,

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.119
domineering,

00:17:45.359 --> 00:17:46.440
the mom who makes the decisions.

00:17:46.839 --> 00:17:47.880
I tell you to balance work and rest, and you get physical!

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:48.599
You get physical! I tell you to balance work and rest!

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:49.880
You're so unreasonable!

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:50.799
You evil mom!

00:17:51.039 --> 00:17:52.000
Who is an evil mom?

00:17:52.599 --> 00:17:54.319
You play games every day! What's going to become of you?

00:17:56.359 --> 00:17:57.400
It seems there was only once...

00:17:58.599 --> 00:17:59.240
Just that once.

00:17:59.839 --> 00:18:01.480
Mom, can you stop pacing?

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.440
You're making me dizzy.

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:03.880
Look at you, child.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.279
Why aren't you anxious at all?

00:18:05.359 --> 00:18:07.000
Li Wai has already received his admission letter.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.440
You didn't fail to get in, did you?

00:18:08.799 --> 00:18:09.799
Good for him.

00:18:10.279 --> 00:18:11.920
So what if I don't? It's not Tsinghua or Peking U anyway.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.400
But Duxing U is the number one school around here!

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.559
You... you're the only one who cares.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:17.720
I don't care.

00:18:23.359 --> 00:18:23.920
Thanks.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:26.200
Mom!

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.519
It's here!

00:18:28.599 --> 00:18:29.359
Is it that big a deal?

00:18:32.759 --> 00:18:33.200
Is it?

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.160
Yes!

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:35.759
Don't tear it!

00:18:36.799 --> 00:18:37.960
Admission Letter.

00:18:38.839 --> 00:18:40.319
Student Kong Xiaocan,

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.359
you have been admitted to our university's

00:18:42.799 --> 00:18:44.240
School of Public Administration,

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.640
majoring in Library Science and Information Science,

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.160
as a four-year undergraduate student.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.920
Okay, okay, Mom, Mom, you don't have to read the whole thing.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.240
I knew you could get in.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.039
You got my brains. Smart.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:56.920
Happy now?

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:57.799
Feel better now?

00:18:59.279 --> 00:19:00.039
You're the only one who cares.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:01.440
I don't even care.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.000
So what?

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.119
This was my regret.

00:19:04.559 --> 00:19:05.640
Now that you've got into college,

00:19:06.359 --> 00:19:07.240
Mom is content.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.119
Just this once

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.319
I think I saw

00:19:19.279 --> 00:19:20.759
the real Kong Guifang

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.200
The most important thing

00:19:29.559 --> 00:19:30.559
is for her to get into college

00:19:30.759 --> 00:19:31.240
right?

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.200
Getting Guifang into college, right?

00:19:33.599 --> 00:19:34.680
You don't need to empathize so much

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.240
Your empathy skills are actually pretty good

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.200
Alright, that wasn't for nothing

00:19:38.279 --> 00:19:39.160
You... you keep watching

00:19:40.839 --> 00:19:41.480
Take care, Brother Xiaocan

00:19:48.799 --> 00:19:49.160
Guifang

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:50.680
You heard everything, right?

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.640
You're usually such an honest person

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.599
Why use schemes now?

00:19:55.039 --> 00:19:55.920
I'm home

00:19:56.759 --> 00:19:57.880
We eat in twenty minutes

00:19:58.319 --> 00:19:58.680
Okay

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.279
Anyway, I'm not going back to school

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:05.519
Guifang

00:20:06.279 --> 00:20:07.480
You're overthinking it

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.519
It's just a substitution problem

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.079
What do you mean?

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:14.759
You feel you owe Brother Xiaocan

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:15.839
He is the most important thing

00:20:16.119 --> 00:20:17.079
That's A equals B

00:20:17.559 --> 00:20:18.319
Brother Xiaocan thinks

00:20:18.319 --> 00:20:19.839
you getting into college is what matters most

00:20:20.079 --> 00:20:21.000
That's B equals C

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.960
Since A equals B, and B equals C

00:20:23.359 --> 00:20:24.319
then A equals C

00:20:27.039 --> 00:20:28.200
Which problem are you talking about?

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.039
I'm saying you are the most important

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.640
That's what Brother Xiaocan wants

00:21:40.359 --> 00:21:41.440
I'll take a batch down first

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.160
Just take the important stuff

00:21:43.559 --> 00:21:44.039
Hurry up

00:21:46.119 --> 00:21:46.559
Who are you?

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.079
Is this the...

00:21:48.279 --> 00:21:49.440
Jianshen Gym, right?

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:50.279
Yes

00:21:51.319 --> 00:21:52.319
I'm looking for your boss

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:53.839
Are you the boss here?

00:21:55.079 --> 00:21:55.680
I'm not

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.200
Do I look like it?

00:21:58.720 --> 00:21:59.920
Then what are you doing?

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:01.640
Renovating? Or running away?

00:22:04.559 --> 00:22:05.640
Probably running away

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.799
Look at the state of this place

00:22:07.319 --> 00:22:07.799
Boss

00:22:08.839 --> 00:22:09.359
Hurry it up

00:22:09.839 --> 00:22:10.640
Or else the members

00:22:10.799 --> 00:22:12.160
and Kong Xiaocan will come for their money

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:12.759
Quick

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.000
Who is it?

00:22:18.519 --> 00:22:19.119
The cleaner?

00:22:22.119 --> 00:22:24.119
I'm the one here to collect for Kong Xiaocan

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:52.880
Mom

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.519
Pay me back. You set me up.

00:22:54.799 --> 00:22:55.920
Mom, Mom, Mom!

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.759
Alright, alright, alright.

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.039
So I understand now.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.799
Let me get this straight.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.119
You and she are a couple.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:11.759
Not anymore.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.000
And you and he are also a couple.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.480
He's my pet.

00:23:22.559 --> 00:23:24.240
So you two are...

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:24.880
She's my client.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:25.759
Love rivals.

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:32.480
And who are you?

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:35.200
I'm mostly with him...

00:23:36.359 --> 00:23:38.119
That is, one of her employees.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:39.880
Ex-employee.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:40.799
Ex-boss.

00:23:43.039 --> 00:23:44.519
So you hit her.

00:23:44.519 --> 00:23:46.160
So you two are...

00:23:46.279 --> 00:23:47.680
What are you thinking? I don't know him.

00:23:48.079 --> 00:23:49.359
Those two scammed him out of money.

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:53.640
Then you two must be...

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.319
I'm his guardian.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.119
So I understand now.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.200
Let me get this straight.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.799
You and she are a couple.

00:24:07.759 --> 00:24:08.680
Not anymore.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.359
No, not a couple.

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:11.920
So you two...

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:12.440
Pet.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:13.960
Right, pet.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:14.559
I'm her employee.

00:24:14.559 --> 00:24:15.119
I... Right.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.200
Guardian. Ex-employee.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:17.000
Right.

00:24:18.759 --> 00:24:20.759
Mom just doesn't want you to sacrifice anything for me.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:22.359
Even if you think...

00:24:22.359 --> 00:24:23.599
something like taking a leave of absence for a year...

00:24:23.599 --> 00:24:25.400
to Mom, that's a huge deal.

00:24:26.359 --> 00:24:26.720
Wait a minute.

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.160
What you can do for me, I can't do for you?

00:24:30.279 --> 00:24:31.119
When you do it, it's duty.

00:24:31.119 --> 00:24:32.000
When I do it, it's a sacrifice.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:32.880
Why the double standard?

00:24:35.079 --> 00:24:35.400
Yes.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.200
I really do want to go to college.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.799
Especially, I want to go to college with you.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.000
I want to... with you...

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.240
walk through those campus gates.

00:24:42.279 --> 00:24:42.559
But...

00:24:42.559 --> 00:24:43.279
You're afraid you won't pass.

00:24:43.759 --> 00:24:44.680
And have to repeat the year next year.

00:24:45.119 --> 00:24:46.319
And I insisted on taking a leave of absence for a year.

00:24:46.319 --> 00:24:47.200
You feel like you've held me back.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.079
Another sacrifice, right?

00:24:48.559 --> 00:24:50.200
Mom, Mom, Mom. Oh my Mom.

00:24:50.279 --> 00:24:51.160
I'm going to test you when we get back.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.400
See what your MBTI personality is.

00:24:52.599 --> 00:24:53.440
You overthink so much.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.559
If you had this energy...

00:24:54.559 --> 00:24:55.440
you would have passed physics long ago.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.039
Bullshit.

00:24:56.319 --> 00:24:57.640
Don't you know how hard physics is?

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:58.680
Did you ever pass it yourself?

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.119
Everyone has their specialty.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:02.319
I was a liberal arts student.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.119
No, Mom.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.000
Look at these past few months.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.759
You've stuck with it.

00:25:08.319 --> 00:25:09.480
Although I'm unreliable...

00:25:09.839 --> 00:25:11.599
I really don't want to give up halfway on this.

00:25:12.279 --> 00:25:13.559
Plus, you've become young now.

00:25:13.559 --> 00:25:14.839
Your physical fitness is better than mine.

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.039
You've restarted your life.

00:25:16.039 --> 00:25:17.480
Shouldn't you do something you want to do?

00:25:25.119 --> 00:25:25.880
Then let's make a bet.

00:25:26.359 --> 00:25:27.079
Kong Xiaocan, do you dare?

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.400
Is there anything your son doesn't dare to do?

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:30.839
One month.

00:25:32.039 --> 00:25:33.039
Just one month's time.

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.440
I'll score 500 points this month.

00:25:35.559 --> 00:25:36.160
You go find a...

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.319
job that earns five thousand a month.

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.319
If we fail even one of these two conditions...

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.000
Then we both go back to our places.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:41.640
And do our own things.

00:25:41.799 --> 00:25:42.279
Is that a deal?

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.000
Okay.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.359
Is three thousand a month okay?

00:25:50.039 --> 00:25:51.640
Okay, okay, okay. Five thousand it is. Five thousand.

00:25:52.319 --> 00:25:52.680
Deal.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:17.920
Find a reliable job.

00:26:18.039 --> 00:26:19.039
Support my Mom through college.

00:26:19.039 --> 00:26:20.240
This is what's most important.

00:26:20.319 --> 00:26:22.279
Everything else needs to step aside.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.599
Kong Xiaocan, you don't have the energy to think about anything else right now.

00:26:55.839 --> 00:26:57.240
Partners Wanted

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.000
Five Social Insurances and One Housing Fund

00:26:59.799 --> 00:27:00.759
Salary negotiable

00:27:19.039 --> 00:27:19.920
Hello, excuse me.

00:27:20.839 --> 00:27:21.200
Hello.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.119
You've been looking at it for half an hour.

00:27:30.839 --> 00:27:32.079
Is there a character you don't recognize?

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.559
Or do you not recognize any of them?

00:27:34.519 --> 00:27:36.599
I know the characters well enough.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.480
It's just that some things don't make sense.

00:27:41.119 --> 00:27:41.599
How so?

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.920
Why is the base salary here...

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.480
...five hundred higher than normal?

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.640
And there are weekends off and comp time every week.

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:48.559
Plus you pay the Five Social Insurances and One Housing Fund.

00:27:49.839 --> 00:27:50.920
You can also choose not to have them.

00:27:52.359 --> 00:27:53.319
No, I want them, I want them.

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.160
It's just... this windfall is too overwhelming.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.160
But there is one thing.

00:27:59.759 --> 00:28:00.599
I'd like to discuss with you.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.640
Can the probation period...

00:28:03.039 --> 00:28:04.440
...be changed from two weeks to one?

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.359
Because I really need money urgently.

00:28:09.119 --> 00:28:09.720
Okay. If not...

00:28:11.039 --> 00:28:13.400
From this moment on, consider yourself hired.

00:28:14.599 --> 00:28:15.720
No back-and-forth negotiation? Come on.

00:28:16.599 --> 00:28:17.279
Drink this tea.

00:28:18.799 --> 00:28:19.400
I'll down one.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:21.920
Join me to admire the rain.

00:28:23.039 --> 00:28:24.839
It's not easy for you young people.

00:28:25.359 --> 00:28:27.519
Let me tell you about my business philosophy.

00:28:28.359 --> 00:28:28.880
One word.

00:28:29.279 --> 00:28:30.000
Happiness.

00:29:17.759 --> 00:29:18.319
Xuefan.

00:29:19.119 --> 00:29:19.559
Look.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.279
On this mock exam...

00:29:21.279 --> 00:29:22.720
...you scored over 660 points.

00:29:23.039 --> 00:29:24.039
You got a perfect score in math.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:25.079
Could you...

00:29:25.359 --> 00:29:26.480
...explain the questions to us?

00:29:27.279 --> 00:29:29.240
This is the only favor Auntie asks of you.

00:29:29.519 --> 00:29:31.079
Wait, who are you calling Auntie?

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.640
I... I've just been retaking the exam for two years.

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:34.599
And you call me Auntie?

00:29:34.599 --> 00:29:35.079
No, no.

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.039
Don't be like that.

00:29:36.039 --> 00:29:36.680
That's not what I meant.

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:37.960
My schedule is actually quite tight.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:39.359
Please help us.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.079
Please.

00:29:47.519 --> 00:29:49.200
I can still squeeze out some time.

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:50.599
Thank you, thank you.

00:29:50.599 --> 00:29:51.079
That's great.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:51.680
Thank you so much.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:52.279
Thank you, thank you.

00:29:53.119 --> 00:29:54.240
Your foundation is weak.

00:29:54.599 --> 00:29:56.880
Do this first to strengthen your basics.

00:29:57.039 --> 00:29:58.279
Give it to me after you finish.

00:29:58.279 --> 00:29:59.000
I'll explain it to you.

00:29:59.079 --> 00:29:59.400
Okay.

00:30:00.519 --> 00:30:01.400
You, come here.

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:04.119
I'll explain this paper to you one-on-one.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.240
Five hundred points.

00:30:05.559 --> 00:30:06.640
Kong Guifang, charge!

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.279
Mom.

00:30:16.039 --> 00:30:17.279
Congratulations on breaking 400 points.

00:30:17.359 --> 00:30:18.240
I'm adding a chicken leg to your meal today.

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:19.519
Quick, it's freshly stewed.

00:30:19.519 --> 00:30:20.319
Super, super fragrant. Tender. Take it.

00:30:20.319 --> 00:30:21.039
I haven't finished the questions yet.

00:30:21.039 --> 00:30:22.240
You... eat first, then write.

00:30:22.319 --> 00:30:23.519
Questions aren't done... Quick, it's chicken leg freedom.

00:30:23.519 --> 00:30:25.079
Be my Chicken Leg Girl today. It's a must.

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:25.880
Be good, eat.

00:30:26.799 --> 00:30:27.839
Okay, I got it. You leave, hurry up.

00:30:27.839 --> 00:30:28.359
You must eat it.

00:30:30.119 --> 00:30:31.160
Look, I'm just... Am I eating?

00:30:32.119 --> 00:30:32.519
Eat it.

00:30:32.799 --> 00:30:33.680
I know, I know.

00:30:36.079 --> 00:30:36.519
I just kn...

00:30:38.079 --> 00:30:38.519
What are you doing?

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.440
Eat. Eat first.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.240
Eat, eat, eat.

00:31:24.079 --> 00:31:26.000
Can you let me play for a couple of days?

00:31:26.319 --> 00:31:27.960
I'm about to go crazy from studying.

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:29.599
Oh, give it a rest.

00:31:30.759 --> 00:31:31.880
You're about to take the exam.

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:33.200
Don't you have a clue?

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:34.480
And you say you're studying like crazy.

00:31:34.599 --> 00:31:35.799
If you don't study now, when will you?

00:31:36.119 --> 00:31:37.039
Come on, right now.

00:31:37.039 --> 00:31:38.519
Just find me one person who went crazy from studying.

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.160
And I'll let you play for a week.

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:42.119
This child...

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:00.319
Guifang

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.079
We've finished memorizing all this.

00:32:02.599 --> 00:32:03.160
Let's go over there.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.000
We haven't memorized that part yet. Let's go.

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:04.599
Let's go.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:08.480
Mom, look, there are two study maniacs here.

00:32:08.799 --> 00:32:10.680
Does this mean we can play for two weeks?

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:15.480
Dong Xuefan

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:17.680
Ninety-six points

00:32:21.079 --> 00:32:21.960
Kong Guifang

00:32:22.799 --> 00:32:23.519
Seventy-three points

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:28.319
Wei Mingtian

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:30.000
Sixty-eight points

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:40.640
Xiaocan

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:42.599
Xiaocan

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:45.880
Where is he?

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.039
I'm back.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.559
What are you doing?

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.319
I was just about to... Why did you take the quilt out?

00:32:52.319 --> 00:32:52.880
I was just telling you.

00:32:53.359 --> 00:32:53.920
What is it?

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:55.720
Starting today...

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:56.920
Starting today...

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.519
Starting today, you're living here.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:32:59.640
I've got everything ready for you.

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.319
Aromatherapy, flowers, and stuff.

00:33:01.319 --> 00:33:02.559
It's quiet here, so you can focus on exam prep.

00:33:05.359 --> 00:33:06.079
You're so thoughtful.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.519
I'm your cousin now, after all.

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:08.599
Of course.

00:33:09.839 --> 00:33:10.160
By the way.

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.039
Here.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:12.680
Look at this.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:13.400
What is this?

00:33:13.519 --> 00:33:14.000
What is it?

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:15.000
This...

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:16.720
What's the total score?

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.440
Five hundred and eight.

00:33:21.319 --> 00:33:21.759
For real?

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:25.799
You're amazing, Mom.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.200
Are you serious? 508 is enough for Duxing U.

00:33:29.799 --> 00:33:30.720
Don't rush, let me tell you.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:31.720
I performed better than usual.

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:35.000
Let me tell you.

00:33:36.279 --> 00:33:38.200
Now we're both in the "five" club.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.240
Look, my salary came in. See for yourself.

00:33:44.319 --> 00:33:44.839
Not bad, right?

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.079
I'm telling you, today is a double celebration.

00:33:50.079 --> 00:33:51.599
We have to go have a big feast.

00:33:51.599 --> 00:33:52.799
Let's eat whatever we want. Let's go.

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:53.400
Don't.

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:54.680
Don't get carried away.

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:55.640
This five thousand yuan...

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.680
...was hard-earned.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:57.599
You have to save the money.

00:33:57.599 --> 00:33:58.000
You know?

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:58.839
You can't spend it all at once.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.119
You won't miss this little bit.

00:34:00.119 --> 00:34:01.039
Today is such a great day.

00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:01.559
I got 508.

00:34:01.559 --> 00:34:02.160
It is a good day.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:02.799
No.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.680
Since it's a good day, I'll cook a meal to celebrate.

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:05.759
Don't. We eat that every day, I'm sick of it.

00:34:05.759 --> 00:34:06.799
I've already ordered takeout.

00:34:06.799 --> 00:34:07.480
Why did you order takeout?

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:08.880
Cancel it for me, I'll cook.

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.480
The rider has already picked up the order.

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.480
That's... that's not nice to them.

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:12.360
It's irresponsible to the rider.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.480
I'm about to wash the rice.

00:34:13.519 --> 00:34:14.679
If you wash rice, I'll unplug the power.

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.599
Actually, the teachers called your parents here...

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:24.320
...not to have them come over...

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.760
...to vent their emotions...

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:28.400
...or to let your parents blame you.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:30.079
Yes, yes, yes.

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:33.000
Kids these days really have it tough.

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:36.480
We...

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:38.360
...want to work with your parents...

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.119
...to find your problems together...

00:34:40.119 --> 00:34:41.280
...and help you solve them.

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:42.000
Right.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000
Kids these days...

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:45.000
...suffer a lot.

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:49.679
Kids these days really don't have it easy.

00:34:52.559 --> 00:34:53.039
Tell me...

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.000
Parents were all once children themselves.

00:34:56.519 --> 00:34:58.519
They should understand children's thoughts best.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.880
But instead, they keep...

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.960
...criticizing the kids for this and that.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.360
Saying that once you become parents later...

00:35:05.559 --> 00:35:07.519
...you will understand our way of thinking.

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.920
Well, the kid really hasn't been a parent.

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.199
But you have been a child.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:15.320
Right?

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:17.199
Right.

00:35:18.039 --> 00:35:18.320
Right.

00:35:19.679 --> 00:35:20.840
I hope you can understand that too.
