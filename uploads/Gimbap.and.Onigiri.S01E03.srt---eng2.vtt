00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.449
{\an8}MAMAMON

00:00:54.784 --> 00:00:56.119
Mom?

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.539
Finally, you picked up!

00:01:01.457 --> 00:01:04.169
{\an8}I don't hear from you at all lately!

00:01:04.252 --> 00:01:07.130
{\an8}How is your move going?

00:01:09.924 --> 00:01:12.260
I'm working on it…

00:01:12.343 --> 00:01:16.264
Also, you don't need to come and help me
this time.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.268
You don't need me to go?

00:01:21.811 --> 00:01:24.898
Yeah. It's so sudden, anyway.

00:01:25.773 --> 00:01:27.650
I have school too, so…

00:01:27.734 --> 00:01:31.029
How can you move all by yourself!

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.364
I'm really okay.

00:01:33.448 --> 00:01:35.283
I'll try to do what I can on my own.

00:01:44.042 --> 00:01:46.502
Your application was accepted.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.550
Thank you.

00:01:52.634 --> 00:01:55.386
I will get all the contracts ready
as fast as I can.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.304
Okay.

00:02:00.975 --> 00:02:02.268
{\an8}I GOT THE APARTMENT

00:02:02.352 --> 00:02:04.062
{\an8}YAY

00:02:05.688 --> 00:02:08.316
KAEDE REAL ESTATE

00:02:12.153 --> 00:02:13.238
I HOPE I CAN SIGN THE CONTRACT ON MY OWN.

00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:14.155
I'M NERVOUS. I SIGNED IT!

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.574
Is he not on lunch break yet?

00:02:20.662 --> 00:02:22.163
RIN (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.634
Taiga.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.428
You should take a break when you can too.

00:02:37.512 --> 00:02:38.471
Okay.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:41.933
Shige.

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:44.727
How were this week's appetizers?

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.146
They were good.

00:02:49.774 --> 00:02:51.818
I'll leave the appetizers
to you from now on.

00:02:53.111 --> 00:02:55.113
{\an8}- Okay! I'll do my best.
- Good.

00:02:55.196 --> 00:02:56.030
{\an8}TANOMI

00:03:00.743 --> 00:03:02.245
All right…

00:03:05.123 --> 00:03:05.957
RIN

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:08.918
{\an8}‪RIN

00:03:09.002 --> 00:03:10.211
{\an8}I'M NERVOUS.

00:03:10.294 --> 00:03:11.379
{\an8}I SIGNED IT!

00:04:19.072 --> 00:04:21.824
Communication issues, huh?

00:04:25.703 --> 00:04:28.664
You'd better solve that
as soon as you can.

00:04:31.209 --> 00:04:34.128
This isn't the first time, right?

00:04:34.212 --> 00:04:37.006
Why are you ignoring the problem?

00:04:38.925 --> 00:04:41.260
If we take the time
to get to know each other,

00:04:42.095 --> 00:04:43.888
won't these issues solve themselves?

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:45.473
Park Rin.

00:04:45.556 --> 00:04:49.519
Are you going to eat the onigiri
one grain of rice at a time?

00:04:49.602 --> 00:04:50.978
At this rate,

00:04:51.062 --> 00:04:54.899
you'll never find out
what the stuffing is.

00:04:55.483 --> 00:04:59.320
But we just started dating.

00:04:59.404 --> 00:05:01.531
If you're dating,

00:05:01.614 --> 00:05:04.409
then stop stressing about it
all on your own,

00:05:04.492 --> 00:05:07.120
and sink your teeth into Onigiri Man!

00:05:09.956 --> 00:05:10.957
Okay?

00:05:23.886 --> 00:05:24.887
{\an8}TANOMI

00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:27.932
{\an8}And ketchup for the pork chops.

00:05:28.015 --> 00:05:30.476
- Okay.
- Here is the shopping list.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.602
- Okay.
- Thanks.

00:05:32.603 --> 00:05:33.688
Good evening.

00:05:36.023 --> 00:05:38.276
Hey, Rin. Good to see you.

00:05:38.359 --> 00:05:39.360
Welcome.

00:05:40.486 --> 00:05:43.447
All right, then. Maybe I'll go home.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.284
- I'll leave the rest to you.
- Okay. Good bye.

00:05:46.367 --> 00:05:47.410
Bye.

00:05:49.704 --> 00:05:50.746
Annyeong.

00:05:58.004 --> 00:05:59.463
Sorry for showing up so suddenly.

00:06:01.465 --> 00:06:02.425
Just give me a second.

00:06:02.508 --> 00:06:04.510
I'll be done soon. Come in.

00:06:15.313 --> 00:06:17.523
I got my apartment.

00:06:18.858 --> 00:06:22.653
What? That's great! Which one?

00:06:23.863 --> 00:06:27.366
The last place we toured.

00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:36.292
This place, huh?
That's great. Congratulations.

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:39.128
Thanks.

00:06:40.922 --> 00:06:41.881
Wow…

00:06:44.217 --> 00:06:45.301
What?

00:06:45.885 --> 00:06:47.345
It's almost your birthday.

00:06:49.931 --> 00:06:51.265
Yeah, it is.

00:06:55.311 --> 00:06:58.397
I'll ask Shige if I can take that day off.

00:06:58.481 --> 00:07:00.274
What? Really?

00:07:01.484 --> 00:07:02.610
Let me celebrate it.

00:07:03.945 --> 00:07:05.238
I'd love that.

00:07:05.321 --> 00:07:08.908
But first, we have to celebrate
your new place.

00:07:09.408 --> 00:07:10.701
Here it is.

00:07:12.328 --> 00:07:13.287
How cute.

00:07:14.455 --> 00:07:15.998
{\an8}RAMEN - OPEN

00:07:16.082 --> 00:07:17.542
{\an8}What a cool place.

00:07:17.625 --> 00:07:19.335
You've never been to a ramen stand?

00:07:20.628 --> 00:07:22.505
But I've seen them in anime.

00:07:23.673 --> 00:07:24.799
Welcome.

00:07:24.882 --> 00:07:25.841
Let's sit down.

00:07:26.842 --> 00:07:29.011
{\an8}- For two, please.
- Two? Okay, have a seat.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.057
{\an8}- Two ramen and…
- Two ramen.

00:07:33.724 --> 00:07:34.725
What do you want to drink?

00:07:35.601 --> 00:07:37.144
I'll have a highball.

00:07:37.228 --> 00:07:38.479
Two highballs please.

00:07:38.563 --> 00:07:40.898
- Two highballs. Okay.
- Thank you.

00:07:48.864 --> 00:07:50.575
Thanks for waiting. Here's your highball.

00:07:51.659 --> 00:07:52.952
Thank you.

00:07:56.372 --> 00:07:57.832
Well then, cheers.

00:07:58.332 --> 00:08:00.001
Cheers.

00:08:06.841 --> 00:08:10.136
My photo of this stand is getting likes.

00:08:11.053 --> 00:08:14.348
Social media?
Do you upload a lot of photos?

00:08:15.766 --> 00:08:17.768
Things like food and doodles.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.856
Did you draw that?

00:08:23.774 --> 00:08:25.484
These are by an artist that I love.

00:08:26.277 --> 00:08:28.446
Every piece is so unique.

00:08:28.529 --> 00:08:29.864
I've been a long-time fan.

00:08:31.365 --> 00:08:32.742
I see.

00:08:39.665 --> 00:08:40.750
Anything else?

00:08:41.751 --> 00:08:43.044
Do you want to ask me anything?

00:08:44.629 --> 00:08:45.838
What?

00:08:48.007 --> 00:08:51.218
I want you to get to know me better.

00:08:51.886 --> 00:08:55.765
And I want to get to know you better too.

00:08:58.059 --> 00:09:00.061
Did something happen?

00:09:03.439 --> 00:09:07.151
Taiga, are you not that good
at keeping in touch?

00:09:13.532 --> 00:09:16.202
When you don't read my messages,

00:09:16.285 --> 00:09:18.204
or a day goes by without a word from you,

00:09:18.704 --> 00:09:21.207
I start to wonder
if you have no interest in me.

00:09:23.209 --> 00:09:24.126
I get worried.

00:09:32.551 --> 00:09:34.970
Thanks for waiting. Here is your ramen.

00:09:35.054 --> 00:09:36.639
NOODLE HOUSE MIYABI

00:09:36.722 --> 00:09:38.724
Enjoy. Thanks for waiting.

00:09:38.808 --> 00:09:40.643
- Here is your ramen.
- Thank you.

00:09:45.272 --> 00:09:46.273
I'm sorry.

00:09:47.066 --> 00:09:51.946
From now on,
I promise I'll contact you once a day.

00:09:55.449 --> 00:09:57.827
Just once a day?

00:10:00.246 --> 00:10:01.914
I didn't mean that literally.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:05.209
What I mean is, I'll work on it.

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:12.341
Thank you.

00:10:14.427 --> 00:10:15.970
Let's eat.

00:10:22.435 --> 00:10:23.811
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

00:10:29.483 --> 00:10:30.568
It's delicious.

00:10:36.657 --> 00:10:38.033
Yeah, that's it.

00:10:41.704 --> 00:10:42.955
Did you find it?

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:45.958
Thank goodness.

00:10:46.542 --> 00:10:48.753
Can you hold onto it until the night?

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:50.880
Okay.

00:10:50.963 --> 00:10:53.215
Bye. Oh, wait.

00:10:55.176 --> 00:10:58.137
Sorry, this might be really random, but…

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.264
What? What is it?

00:11:00.806 --> 00:11:02.266
What kind of gift

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:04.977
would make you happy?

00:11:05.561 --> 00:11:06.395
Huh?

00:11:06.479 --> 00:11:09.899
Well, it's almost Rin's birthday.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.818
I was thinking about what to get,

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.197
but nothing really stood out.

00:11:19.325 --> 00:11:21.118
Birthday, huh?

00:11:23.412 --> 00:11:26.457
There's no point
if someone tells you what to get.

00:11:27.166 --> 00:11:31.545
Wouldn't she be happy to get something
that comes from your heart?

00:11:32.046 --> 00:11:33.339
- You think so?
- Yeah.

00:11:35.049 --> 00:11:36.008
Well…

00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:38.511
The beginning stages of dating
are always fun.

00:11:39.011 --> 00:11:40.095
So take your time and think.

00:11:41.347 --> 00:11:44.391
I'll do that. Thanks. Bye.

00:11:50.189 --> 00:11:51.232
Mom.

00:11:52.316 --> 00:11:54.068
Mom, wake up.

00:11:54.151 --> 00:11:57.988
- Noa?
- Drink water.

00:11:59.281 --> 00:12:01.242
BIRTHDAY GIFTS FOR YOUR GIRLFRIEND

00:12:01.325 --> 00:12:03.327
TOP 20 GIFTS
THAT YOUR GIRLFRIEND WOULD LOVE

00:12:18.968 --> 00:12:20.970
LOOK

00:12:21.053 --> 00:12:23.597
RAMEN

00:12:54.169 --> 00:12:56.171
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

00:12:56.255 --> 00:12:57.965
Do you have this?

00:12:59.174 --> 00:13:02.386
We don't carry that. I'm sorry.

00:13:02.469 --> 00:13:03.429
I see.

00:13:04.013 --> 00:13:05.514
Excuse me.

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:08.642
I'm looking for this book.

00:13:09.351 --> 00:13:12.521
I guess it's out-of-print,
and I can't find it anywhere.

00:13:25.075 --> 00:13:26.493
All right.

00:13:36.879 --> 00:13:40.132
- It's eomma…
- You don't need to answer it?

00:13:40.716 --> 00:13:44.720
It's okay. It'll be a nightmare
if she finds out you're here.

00:13:44.803 --> 00:13:46.305
I'll call her back later.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:52.603
Taiga.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:56.190
Can I move your stuff over there?

00:13:56.899 --> 00:13:58.067
I'll do it!

00:14:10.746 --> 00:14:13.082
Helping her move, huh?

00:14:14.291 --> 00:14:17.252
Taiga is so the type
to pamper his girlfriend.

00:14:20.005 --> 00:14:22.633
Not like some boyfriends out there
who do slots on pay day.

00:14:22.716 --> 00:14:23.550
Here.

00:14:23.634 --> 00:14:25.052
- Have some oshinko.
- Thanks.

00:14:25.719 --> 00:14:26.845
Welcome.

00:14:30.599 --> 00:14:32.059
Go ahead and have a seat.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.817
Please sit.

00:14:47.366 --> 00:14:48.492
What is he saying?

00:14:48.575 --> 00:14:50.869
He's asking if there's an English menu.

00:14:50.953 --> 00:14:52.121
We don't have that.

00:14:52.204 --> 00:14:53.789
Of course we don't.

00:14:55.374 --> 00:14:56.959
He's saying something…

00:15:13.642 --> 00:15:14.643
Delicious.

00:15:18.772 --> 00:15:20.190
Good, good…

00:15:24.695 --> 00:15:26.113
Thanks.

00:15:28.198 --> 00:15:30.284
Should I make an English menu
or something?

00:15:31.201 --> 00:15:32.786
That's true…

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:36.540
We get a lot of foreign customers lately,
so that would be great.

00:15:40.127 --> 00:15:42.337
But don't expect too much.

00:15:42.421 --> 00:15:44.757
- Of course I have high expectations.
- Don't.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.425
In addition to English,

00:15:47.342 --> 00:15:48.385
we need French,

00:15:48.469 --> 00:15:51.346
- Italian, Spanish, Korean…
- No, no!

00:15:55.768 --> 00:15:57.311
It's done!

00:15:59.063 --> 00:16:01.148
Good work. Here.

00:16:01.231 --> 00:16:02.566
Thank you.

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:11.492
This is my first time moving on my own.

00:16:12.076 --> 00:16:14.661
So having you with me was very reassuring.

00:16:48.987 --> 00:16:50.823
Hello, who's there?

00:17:01.959 --> 00:17:03.377
Mom?!

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.754
Rin, it's your birthday tomorrow, right?

00:17:05.838 --> 00:17:08.799
So I came here to see you.
Hurry up and open the door!

00:17:09.967 --> 00:17:11.593
Give me a second.

00:17:12.845 --> 00:17:14.596
My mom is here! What should I do?

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:18.058
- What?
- What should I do…

00:17:18.142 --> 00:17:19.393
- Rin?
- Oh no…

00:17:21.645 --> 00:17:22.896
This way.

00:17:26.066 --> 00:17:28.318
I missed you, Rin!

00:17:29.361 --> 00:17:31.405
Good to see you, Mom.

00:17:31.488 --> 00:17:33.448
I missed you so much.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:42.166
You pretty much got everything organized.

00:17:42.249 --> 00:17:45.335
I booked a hotel,
because I thought it would be a mess.

00:17:46.044 --> 00:17:48.338
But at this rate,
I can stay here from tonight.

00:17:48.881 --> 00:17:52.676
Rin, where's your bedroom? That way?

00:17:52.759 --> 00:17:57.181
Mom! Mom!

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:02.811
What a nice room. It's so fluffy.

00:18:02.895 --> 00:18:05.564
Rin, where's your extra futon?

00:18:06.773 --> 00:18:07.774
Over here?

00:18:09.484 --> 00:18:12.154
- Mom!
- What?

00:18:19.536 --> 00:18:22.623
I'm so hungry…

00:18:22.706 --> 00:18:26.627
Oh, you were hungry? Let's eat then!

00:18:28.629 --> 00:18:29.671
But you know,

00:18:30.339 --> 00:18:31.924
I'm so glad.

00:18:32.007 --> 00:18:33.634
I was worried

00:18:33.717 --> 00:18:37.679
that you had found
a boyfriend or something.

00:18:37.763 --> 00:18:39.556
I'm so relieved.

00:18:45.229 --> 00:18:46.396
I'm sorry.

00:18:53.278 --> 00:18:55.781
I put in extra sesame oil,
just how you like it.

00:19:12.297 --> 00:19:13.632
It smells good.

00:19:17.261 --> 00:19:18.887
She's in the bathroom, so go now.

00:19:18.971 --> 00:19:19.888
Huh?

00:19:20.931 --> 00:19:23.934
H… Hey… wait…

00:19:24.017 --> 00:19:25.852
Should we be sneaking around like this?

00:19:25.936 --> 00:19:28.355
Shouldn't I introduce myself properly?

00:19:28.438 --> 00:19:30.274
Are you crazy?

00:19:30.983 --> 00:19:33.151
Please, leave.

00:19:33.652 --> 00:19:35.320
What about your birthday?

00:19:35.404 --> 00:19:38.740
That… I want to spend with you
no matter what.

00:19:38.824 --> 00:19:40.701
I'll contact you as soon as she leaves.

00:19:40.784 --> 00:19:41.785
I promise.

00:19:43.078 --> 00:19:44.454
She's coming out! Hurry!

00:19:44.538 --> 00:19:46.039
Shoes, shoes, shoes!

00:20:07.519 --> 00:20:09.521
You like this, right?

00:20:10.731 --> 00:20:13.317
Here, eat the omelet too.

00:20:15.068 --> 00:20:16.153
How is school?

00:20:18.947 --> 00:20:21.700
Are you enjoying school?

00:20:23.577 --> 00:20:27.581
Are you studying like you should be?

00:20:28.248 --> 00:20:30.542
There's someone in my class
who's really good.

00:20:31.168 --> 00:20:35.339
And that person is inspiring me.

00:20:38.216 --> 00:20:42.804
Sometimes I wonder if I have any talent,
and get a little discouraged, though.

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:46.725
But I just have to do my best!

00:20:50.145 --> 00:20:54.483
I guess the road to becoming
a creator is a tough one…

00:21:18.423 --> 00:21:20.509
Shige? Is something wrong?

00:21:20.592 --> 00:21:21.843
So, so, so sorry.

00:21:21.927 --> 00:21:25.097
I completely forgot that we had
a reservation for a big group.

00:21:26.181 --> 00:21:28.725
Can I ask you to come in,
just for two hours?

00:21:29.393 --> 00:21:31.311
What? Now?

00:21:31.395 --> 00:21:32.437
Excuse me. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:21:32.521 --> 00:21:33.855
Yes, one moment please.

00:21:36.733 --> 00:21:39.194
I think I can come in.

00:21:39.277 --> 00:21:42.197
Really? You're a lifesaver. Hurry, please.

00:21:44.241 --> 00:21:45.242
Okay.

00:22:11.101 --> 00:22:12.269
Noa.

00:22:14.479 --> 00:22:17.732
- I haven't gotten paid yet, so no.
- Are you serious?

00:22:24.906 --> 00:22:26.199
What is that? English?

00:22:26.283 --> 00:22:27.450
Are you traveling?

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:31.121
Not traveling, but…

00:22:31.204 --> 00:22:35.250
Vegas would be awesome.
The land of the free.

00:22:37.085 --> 00:22:40.964
But I'd be happy to go anywhere,
as long as I'm with you.

00:22:44.467 --> 00:22:48.471
But in order to do that,
we need to win first.

00:22:51.474 --> 00:22:52.851
Just one, okay?

00:22:52.934 --> 00:22:53.935
- Really?
- Yes.

00:23:00.358 --> 00:23:01.234
Paw.

00:23:02.777 --> 00:23:04.112
- Aren't you going to bark?
- Woof!

00:23:06.698 --> 00:23:08.825
You're the best girlfriend!

00:23:08.909 --> 00:23:10.285
All right, all right.

00:23:10.368 --> 00:23:12.037
- Can I go?
- Sure.

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.831
- I will win, I promise.
- Yeah, yeah…

00:23:14.915 --> 00:23:15.832
Bye!

00:23:24.716 --> 00:23:26.885
That was delicious.

00:23:30.889 --> 00:23:32.349
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:23:33.975 --> 00:23:36.478
I'm really happy that you're here,

00:23:36.561 --> 00:23:40.649
but I still haven't finished my assignment
that's due today…

00:23:40.732 --> 00:23:42.943
Really?

00:23:43.568 --> 00:23:47.697
My goodness,
you should've told me that earlier.

00:23:47.781 --> 00:23:52.494
After I clean this all up,
I'll go back to my hotel.

00:23:52.577 --> 00:23:54.663
You don't have to worry about me.

00:23:54.746 --> 00:23:58.833
You work hard on your assignment! Okay?

00:24:09.552 --> 00:24:11.012
I'm so sorry, Mom.

00:24:12.555 --> 00:24:14.307
Thank you for waiting.

00:24:14.391 --> 00:24:16.351
- Here's your karaage.
- Can you take our order?

00:24:16.434 --> 00:24:18.603
- Yes.
- The seasonal carpaccio please.

00:24:18.687 --> 00:24:20.438
- One carpaccio.
- That's all.

00:24:31.283 --> 00:24:32.325
Taiga!

00:24:33.118 --> 00:24:34.828
Can you make that order?

00:24:34.911 --> 00:24:36.288
Okay.

00:24:36.371 --> 00:24:38.248
Here's your omelet.

00:24:38.331 --> 00:24:40.208
RIN

00:24:55.015 --> 00:24:56.057
Taiga?

00:25:02.272 --> 00:25:03.481
Is he mad?

00:25:07.694 --> 00:25:10.113
{\an8}SORRY FOR MAKING YOU WAIT
YOU CAN COME OVER NOW

00:25:10.196 --> 00:25:12.449
{\an8}WHERE ARE YOU?

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.911
{\an8}You promised…

00:25:35.889 --> 00:25:37.307
- Excuse me!
- Yes!

00:25:55.325 --> 00:25:56.451
{\an8}LEE YUNGYEOL: HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
MIZUKI: RIN - HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

00:25:56.534 --> 00:25:57.577
{\an8}JUNHO: HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:58.578
{\an8}LEE HAEUN: HAPPY BIRTHDAY, RIN!
TODAY IS YOUR DAY!

00:25:58.661 --> 00:25:59.829
{\an8}MAMAMON: HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MY GIRL!
I'LL LOVE YOU FOREVER!

00:25:59.913 --> 00:26:01.206
{\an8}YUN CHAEWON: IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY! WOW!
WHEN WILL WE HAVE THE PARTY?

00:26:01.706 --> 00:26:02.832
TAIGA

00:26:02.916 --> 00:26:04.417
SORRY FOR MAKING YOU WAIT
YOU CAN COME OVER NOW

00:26:04.501 --> 00:26:05.794
WHERE ARE YOU?

00:26:07.045 --> 00:26:08.213
Why?

00:26:22.352 --> 00:26:24.145
Unbelievable!

00:26:24.896 --> 00:26:26.689
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

00:26:26.773 --> 00:26:28.191
Thank you.

00:26:31.403 --> 00:26:33.655
Finally, they're gone.

00:26:35.865 --> 00:26:37.033
Thanks so much for today.

00:26:37.117 --> 00:26:38.576
- You really saved me.
- No worries.

00:26:44.457 --> 00:26:45.917
{\an8}RIN

00:26:46.626 --> 00:26:48.253
Oh crap!

00:26:54.259 --> 00:26:55.468
TAIGA

00:26:58.805 --> 00:27:01.224
TOMORROW - I'LL GO
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING

00:27:38.428 --> 00:27:39.804
{\an8}Happy birthday!

00:27:50.982 --> 00:27:52.942
Why didn't you say anything?

00:27:53.818 --> 00:27:54.736
What?

00:27:56.362 --> 00:27:57.989
I was waiting for you the whole time.

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:01.993
I messaged you as soon as eomma left.
I was looking forward to it!

00:28:02.785 --> 00:28:03.870
Sorry.

00:28:05.663 --> 00:28:07.415
I noticed around midnight

00:28:08.458 --> 00:28:10.084
and called you right away…

00:28:11.336 --> 00:28:13.713
Why didn't you
check your phone until then?

00:28:15.215 --> 00:28:16.966
I was busy at work.

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:19.052
What? You said you had the day off.

00:28:19.135 --> 00:28:20.136
Well…

00:28:21.054 --> 00:28:22.931
I was asked to work that evening.

00:28:24.516 --> 00:28:27.685
Tell me those kinds of things.
Why didn't you say anything?

00:28:27.769 --> 00:28:29.103
That's because…

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.984
I thought you were having fun
with your mom.

00:28:39.072 --> 00:28:41.032
I'm sorry about eomma coming…

00:28:43.076 --> 00:28:47.747
But I wanted to be with you
when it became my birthday.

00:28:51.125 --> 00:28:53.753
When you like someone,
don't you naturally want to talk to them?

00:28:54.295 --> 00:28:56.673
Not just once a day,
or because you have to.

00:28:57.423 --> 00:29:00.260
- You can't even put in that effort for me.
- Wait.

00:29:01.678 --> 00:29:04.013
I'm sorry for not telling you.

00:29:05.056 --> 00:29:07.600
- But that has nothing to do with--
- It does!

00:29:08.268 --> 00:29:10.937
I like to hear from you.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:13.273
And when you put in the effort,
it makes me happy.

00:29:14.607 --> 00:29:15.608
Why don't you get that?

00:29:25.243 --> 00:29:29.330
All my friends from Korea
contacted me at midnight.

00:29:30.665 --> 00:29:34.210
That is how important
birthdays are to them.

00:29:38.214 --> 00:29:39.924
How was I supposed to know…

00:29:42.677 --> 00:29:45.013
Don't push your standards on me.

00:29:55.148 --> 00:29:57.650
Fine. Whatever.

00:30:54.123 --> 00:30:57.543
Here's your water.

00:30:58.503 --> 00:31:00.254
{\an8}TANOMI

00:31:00.338 --> 00:31:01.756
{\an8}Hello.

00:31:01.839 --> 00:31:03.174
Oh, what's wrong?

00:31:03.257 --> 00:31:06.511
Plans have changed, so can I work today?

00:31:06.594 --> 00:31:07.637
Changed?

00:31:08.763 --> 00:31:10.807
I see…

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:13.393
Sorry, that was my fault.

00:31:13.476 --> 00:31:15.979
No, it's not your fault, Shige.

00:31:18.481 --> 00:31:20.566
Maybe it is difficult for two people

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:23.319
from different backgrounds to be together?

00:31:26.197 --> 00:31:28.908
You two are separate human beings,
so running into problems

00:31:28.992 --> 00:31:30.535
is to be expected.

00:31:31.494 --> 00:31:34.080
It's not convincing,
coming from a single guy, huh?

00:31:38.167 --> 00:31:40.169
What do you think was the problem?

00:31:45.049 --> 00:31:48.136
I can't seem to keep up with her.

00:31:49.262 --> 00:31:51.014
She wants to communicate regularly,

00:31:51.097 --> 00:31:53.057
but I don't understand that concept.

00:31:53.808 --> 00:31:57.020
Of course, it can't be helped
that we're from different cultures.

00:31:57.103 --> 00:31:59.564
And I thought
that it wouldn't matter, but…

00:32:01.482 --> 00:32:04.152
Why did Rin say that she wants
to communicate regularly?

00:32:06.404 --> 00:32:07.697
She said…

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:11.784
she wants me to know more about her.

00:32:15.663 --> 00:32:19.333
Then I don't think it's the lack
of communication that she's mad about.

00:32:25.131 --> 00:32:28.134
It's okay to run into problems.

00:32:44.484 --> 00:32:45.443
Shige.

00:32:46.444 --> 00:32:48.654
Can I take today off, after all?

00:32:49.489 --> 00:32:51.616
Sure. Good luck.

00:34:01.686 --> 00:34:02.562
{\an8}Rin.

00:34:03.437 --> 00:34:04.480
{\an8}Taiga…

00:34:10.695 --> 00:34:11.988
{\an8}Hey, wait!

00:34:13.531 --> 00:34:14.574
{\an8}Rin!

00:34:48.733 --> 00:34:49.775
I'm sorry…

00:34:53.029 --> 00:34:57.074
I couldn't celebrate
your birthday with you.

00:34:59.994 --> 00:35:04.415
If I had communicated with you,
this wouldn't have happened.

00:35:30.733 --> 00:35:33.694
I'm sorry too.

00:35:34.904 --> 00:35:36.989
I was only thinking about myself.

00:35:38.157 --> 00:35:40.243
I wasn't thinking about your feelings.

00:35:49.502 --> 00:35:51.003
Your present…

00:35:51.087 --> 00:35:52.255
I loved it.

00:35:53.506 --> 00:35:55.424
I barely told you about it…

00:35:55.967 --> 00:35:57.593
But you remembered?

00:36:00.346 --> 00:36:04.183
When you said that you're a big fan,
your eyes were sparkling.

00:36:05.393 --> 00:36:07.228
I could tell you really liked it.

00:36:08.938 --> 00:36:11.983
You were trying
to get to know me, after all.

00:36:18.739 --> 00:36:19.991
Lately,

00:36:21.325 --> 00:36:22.702
when I'm cooking,

00:36:23.786 --> 00:36:25.663
I think of you.

00:36:29.208 --> 00:36:31.544
"Will she like this,
if I make this for her?"

00:36:33.004 --> 00:36:36.841
"What would she say
if I sent a photo of this to her?"

00:36:39.844 --> 00:36:41.178
I should have

00:36:43.514 --> 00:36:44.849
told you all these things.

00:36:47.518 --> 00:36:50.438
We can talk to each other any time.
We're dating, after all.

00:37:04.368 --> 00:37:05.328
From now on…

00:37:07.621 --> 00:37:09.665
I want to know more about

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.293
the things you value.

00:37:15.796 --> 00:37:16.964
Thank you.

00:37:19.508 --> 00:37:20.551
Me too. (Support Admin Watch on

00:38:33.707 --> 00:38:35.626
Welcome home, Taiga.

00:38:35.709 --> 00:38:38.045
Don't get the wrong idea.
Anyone can do that.

00:38:38.129 --> 00:38:41.298
{\an8}I wasn't able to live up to my
family's expectations.

00:38:41.382 --> 00:38:43.050
{\an8}I don't think so!

00:38:43.134 --> 00:38:44.009
