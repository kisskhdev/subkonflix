00:01:18.104 --> 00:01:19.384
When we questioned Wu Da,

00:01:20.184 --> 00:01:24.264
he admitted he was unwilling
to divorce Wang Xiaole

00:01:25.225 --> 00:01:27.904
and he was unhappy
with her dating a new boyfriend.

00:01:28.305 --> 00:01:28.984
By the way,

00:01:29.945 --> 00:01:34.104
after they got married, they bought
the place at Shancheng Community.

00:01:34.104 --> 00:01:36.264
After the divorce,
Wu Da gave it to Wang Xiaole.

00:01:36.904 --> 00:01:38.225
Therefore, we believe

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:42.744
there's potential motivation
from a financial perspective.

00:01:43.544 --> 00:01:45.104
But the crime scene investigation

00:01:45.744 --> 00:01:48.344
shows no definitive evidence
of Wu Da's involvement.

00:01:49.425 --> 00:01:51.464
At 10 PM on the night of the murder,

00:01:52.344 --> 00:01:54.624
after Wu Da left through the north gate,

00:01:54.824 --> 00:01:56.705
he never reappeared on surveillance.

00:01:59.184 --> 00:02:01.945
What size shoes does Wu Da wear?

00:02:02.264 --> 00:02:02.945
Size 42.

00:02:08.105 --> 00:02:10.385
Xiaole called me that night

00:02:10.385 --> 00:02:11.585
and asked me to come see her.

00:02:12.064 --> 00:02:15.585
I arrived around 9 PM.

00:02:17.865 --> 00:02:18.464
Xiaole?

00:02:22.025 --> 00:02:22.624
Xiaole?

00:02:26.705 --> 00:02:27.385
Xiaole?

00:02:28.504 --> 00:02:29.184
Xiao...

00:02:36.344 --> 00:02:38.425
(You and Wang Xiaole are divorced.)

00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:39.904
Why keep this relationship?

00:02:41.344 --> 00:02:43.344
Xiaole and I never intended to divorce.

00:02:43.344 --> 00:02:45.265
Our relationship was great.

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:48.705
But her parents threatened suicide
to force her to divorce me.

00:02:51.825 --> 00:02:53.865
It's my fault too,
a man with no money or future.

00:02:54.504 --> 00:02:55.744
(I didn't become a doctor.)

00:02:55.744 --> 00:02:57.944
Later, I became a pharmaceutical rep
at a bad time

00:02:57.944 --> 00:02:58.985
and lost a lot of money.

00:02:59.904 --> 00:03:02.145
I couldn't provide Xiaole
a better material life.

00:03:02.145 --> 00:03:05.145
That's why I voluntarily
gave her the place.

00:03:06.224 --> 00:03:07.464
Although divorced,

00:03:07.464 --> 00:03:08.464
we didn't cut ties.

00:03:08.464 --> 00:03:11.705
We'd meet two or three times a month,

00:03:12.305 --> 00:03:13.464
usually at hotels,

00:03:15.145 --> 00:03:16.025
occasionally at home.

00:03:16.224 --> 00:03:17.025
No overnight stay.

00:03:17.545 --> 00:03:18.705
Xiaole's parents have keys.

00:03:18.705 --> 00:03:19.585
If they caught us...

00:03:22.825 --> 00:03:25.545
We hadn't met in the last six months.

00:03:25.624 --> 00:03:26.904
All we had were texts

00:03:26.904 --> 00:03:27.744
and calls.

00:03:28.664 --> 00:03:31.904
I knew her parents had introduced her
to someone new.

00:03:32.744 --> 00:03:33.425
Huang Chong?

00:03:34.705 --> 00:03:37.464
Huang Chong outperforms me in every way.

00:03:38.504 --> 00:03:40.145
Xiaole told me they got along well.

00:03:40.145 --> 00:03:41.705
It was serious, leading to marriage.

00:03:43.265 --> 00:03:46.224
After you had sexual intercourse
with Wang Xiaole that night,

00:03:46.825 --> 00:03:47.784
what did you do next?

00:03:48.624 --> 00:03:50.184
She took a full shower.

00:03:50.545 --> 00:03:51.744
I just took a quick one.

00:03:58.664 --> 00:03:59.425
You're beautiful.

00:04:00.464 --> 00:04:01.784
Any food? I'm hungry.

00:04:07.224 --> 00:04:08.265
I'm getting married.

00:04:09.705 --> 00:04:10.825
To that Huang Chong guy?

00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:13.904
What does your family see in him?

00:04:15.425 --> 00:04:16.344
He's permanent staff.

00:04:16.825 --> 00:04:17.784
And he's reliable.

00:04:22.304 --> 00:04:23.784
We shouldn't see each other anymore.

00:04:26.945 --> 00:04:28.424
Wontons are in the kitchen.

00:04:28.864 --> 00:04:29.864
I'll heat them for you.

00:04:30.304 --> 00:04:30.945
No need.

00:04:36.505 --> 00:04:37.145
I'm leaving.

00:04:39.904 --> 00:04:40.825
(You left?)

00:04:41.705 --> 00:04:42.904
What was the exact time?

00:04:43.145 --> 00:04:43.864
10 PM.

00:04:46.224 --> 00:04:47.745
Where did you go after leaving?

00:04:48.825 --> 00:04:51.505
I didn't go home after leaving.

00:04:51.505 --> 00:04:53.585
I just drank by the roadside.

00:04:53.705 --> 00:04:54.585
Where'd you buy it?

00:04:55.745 --> 00:04:56.904
A small supermarket there.

00:04:58.464 --> 00:04:59.385
Then what?

00:05:00.344 --> 00:05:01.145
After that,

00:05:02.185 --> 00:05:04.904
I... I knew
Xiaole was marrying another man.

00:05:04.904 --> 00:05:05.945
I was mentally prepared,

00:05:05.945 --> 00:05:08.864
but I couldn't accept it emotionally.

00:05:09.344 --> 00:05:10.664
I hadn't even finished half of it

00:05:10.664 --> 00:05:11.505
before getting drunk.

00:05:12.104 --> 00:05:13.784
The cool breeze later sobered me up.

00:05:13.784 --> 00:05:14.625
So I went home.

00:05:15.104 --> 00:05:16.424
What time was that approximately?

00:05:17.745 --> 00:05:19.664
I really don't remember.

00:05:19.664 --> 00:05:20.784
I was already drunk then.

00:05:22.505 --> 00:05:24.265
Where exactly were you drinking?

00:05:24.265 --> 00:05:25.065
The specific spot?

00:05:26.505 --> 00:05:28.664
Left of the community's north gate,

00:05:28.664 --> 00:05:29.984
there's a large flower bed.

00:05:30.065 --> 00:05:30.904
From our place...

00:05:32.544 --> 00:05:34.464
From Xiaole's place, you could see it.

00:05:46.984 --> 00:05:47.745
Captain Leng.

00:06:05.825 --> 00:06:07.745
I heard Wu Da and Wang Xiaole

00:06:07.745 --> 00:06:09.464
stole their household registries
to marry

00:06:09.705 --> 00:06:11.585
due to family opposition.

00:06:13.664 --> 00:06:15.464
They clearly loved each other.

00:06:15.705 --> 00:06:17.505
Why couldn't they stay together?

00:06:18.745 --> 00:06:20.185
Life's pressures, I suppose.

00:06:44.825 --> 00:06:46.344
What would you two like to order?

00:06:46.825 --> 00:06:48.145
Sir, got a minute?

00:06:50.344 --> 00:06:52.825
Did you see this person
on the night of the 9th?

00:06:53.664 --> 00:06:54.625
This person? No.

00:06:54.625 --> 00:06:55.705
Are you sure?

00:06:57.025 --> 00:06:57.864
I'm sure.

00:06:58.424 --> 00:07:00.265
Why are you asking
about that drunkard again?

00:07:00.265 --> 00:07:01.625
Didn't you ask the other day?

00:07:02.265 --> 00:07:03.705
He comes often.

00:07:03.705 --> 00:07:05.705
Every time, he buys a bottle of liquor.

00:07:05.705 --> 00:07:07.224
The cheapest kind.

00:07:08.265 --> 00:07:09.185
After buying it,

00:07:09.185 --> 00:07:11.864
he drinks by that flower bed over there.

00:07:12.304 --> 00:07:13.185
That one right there.

00:07:14.625 --> 00:07:16.664
He can't hold his liquor,

00:07:16.945 --> 00:07:17.984
and he's a mean drunk.

00:07:19.505 --> 00:07:20.984
Whenever he drinks, he makes a scene.

00:07:21.505 --> 00:07:22.505
Sometimes he cries.

00:07:22.544 --> 00:07:23.864
Sometimes he howls over there.

00:07:24.664 --> 00:07:25.424
It's terrible.

00:07:31.625 --> 00:07:34.585
I heard the woman who died
in our neighborhood was his ex-wife.

00:07:34.825 --> 00:07:35.984
Did he do it?

00:07:37.544 --> 00:07:39.505
Will a death here
affect the housing prices?

00:07:41.825 --> 00:07:43.224
Did he come the night of the 9th?

00:07:43.224 --> 00:07:45.025
He did.
Bought a bottle of liquor and left.

00:07:45.185 --> 00:07:46.625
Do you remember what time he left?

00:07:46.625 --> 00:07:47.424
What time?

00:07:48.745 --> 00:07:49.904
Around after 10 PM, I think.

00:07:50.544 --> 00:07:52.424
There were still many customers then.

00:07:53.945 --> 00:07:55.145
Where did he go after leaving?

00:07:55.145 --> 00:07:56.025
Did you see?

00:07:56.025 --> 00:07:56.705
I saw him.

00:07:56.705 --> 00:07:59.585
He went out, turned left,
and headed straight for that flower bed.

00:07:59.585 --> 00:08:00.745
Definitely that flower bed.

00:08:10.664 --> 00:08:11.385
It's him.

00:08:12.705 --> 00:08:16.304
Every night when I walk my dog here,
I see him.

00:08:16.945 --> 00:08:18.224
Drunk out of his mind.

00:08:18.945 --> 00:08:20.664
Even my dog wants to avoid him.

00:08:21.864 --> 00:08:24.864
You mean the 9th?
He was there that day too.

00:08:25.224 --> 00:08:26.664
I remember it clearly.

00:08:28.464 --> 00:08:29.224
Sir,

00:08:29.825 --> 00:08:33.265
do you remember about what time

00:08:33.544 --> 00:08:34.745
you saw him?

00:08:34.745 --> 00:08:38.544
I walk my dog at fixed times every day.

00:08:38.544 --> 00:08:39.385
Come rain or shine.

00:08:39.704 --> 00:08:40.664
Twice a day.

00:08:40.664 --> 00:08:42.345
One walk is at this time of day.

00:08:42.904 --> 00:08:44.664
The other is at night.

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:47.225
I went out at 11:30 PM

00:08:47.505 --> 00:08:49.265
and returned at 1:50 AM.

00:08:49.704 --> 00:08:51.225
Both when I left and returned,

00:08:51.225 --> 00:08:53.784
I saw him. He slumped here.

00:08:55.904 --> 00:08:57.145
Are you sure it's him?

00:08:57.304 --> 00:08:59.704
The lighting around here
isn't great at night.

00:08:59.944 --> 00:09:01.184
Could it be that you...

00:09:01.184 --> 00:09:01.944
Young man,

00:09:02.745 --> 00:09:05.505
are you saying I'm old
and my eyes are failing?

00:09:05.865 --> 00:09:07.105
It was absolutely him.

00:09:08.025 --> 00:09:10.505
It's not like I've seen him
just once or twice.

00:09:10.824 --> 00:09:12.745
He's here every few days.

00:09:14.025 --> 00:09:16.824
A troubled young man, hooked on drink.

00:09:18.424 --> 00:09:19.904
It's disgraceful.

00:09:19.904 --> 00:09:20.424
Right.

00:09:20.424 --> 00:09:21.904
I even want to teach him a lesson.

00:09:22.745 --> 00:09:23.745
Let me tell you.

00:09:24.225 --> 00:09:25.904
These young people today...

00:09:26.865 --> 00:09:28.064
How should I put it?

00:09:28.584 --> 00:09:29.225
Yeah.

00:09:30.225 --> 00:09:31.625
Back in our day, right?

00:09:31.625 --> 00:09:33.625
We came home right after work.

00:09:41.857 --> 00:09:48.536
(North Gate)

00:10:10.505 --> 00:10:11.985
Based on our neighborhood canvass,

00:10:12.424 --> 00:10:16.544
Wu Da was drinking at the north gate
flower bed during the crime's timeframe.

00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:18.904
He couldn't have killed her.

00:10:18.904 --> 00:10:20.865
Time to eat!

00:10:20.865 --> 00:10:23.105
Focus on identifying this person
in the surveillance.

00:10:23.745 --> 00:10:24.904
Come on, eat first.

00:10:25.385 --> 00:10:26.465
Come on, let's eat.

00:10:26.465 --> 00:10:27.416
I'll get yours, Master.

00:10:32.664 --> 00:10:33.225
Thank you.

00:10:34.145 --> 00:10:35.105
Here, help yourselves.

00:10:40.865 --> 00:10:42.664
Thanks.

00:10:45.544 --> 00:10:46.345
Thank you.

00:10:46.345 --> 00:10:46.824
Here.

00:10:47.704 --> 00:10:48.424
Alright.

00:10:49.625 --> 00:10:50.745
Okay, the chopsticks.

00:10:54.225 --> 00:10:54.745
Ziwu.

00:10:54.944 --> 00:10:56.184
Perfect timing. Join us.

00:10:56.704 --> 00:10:57.304
Captain Leng,

00:10:58.345 --> 00:11:02.225
I found small debris on the doormat
at Wang Xiaole's place earlier.

00:11:02.225 --> 00:11:04.904
Tests revealed
it was fresh Masson pine bark.

00:11:06.304 --> 00:11:09.865
North of Shancheng Community
is a large pine forest.

00:11:11.424 --> 00:11:16.745
Neither Wu Da nor the victim's parents
have hiking habits.

00:11:16.824 --> 00:11:18.704
The chance of them
stepping on it is very low.

00:11:20.544 --> 00:11:25.784
And it's mostly Japanese red pine,
Chinese red pine, and Armand pine here.

00:11:26.105 --> 00:11:27.824
Masson pines are very rare.

00:11:27.824 --> 00:11:29.025
Especially in the urban area.

00:11:31.145 --> 00:11:32.625
Alright, hurry up and eat.

00:11:32.865 --> 00:11:35.544
After eating, we'll check the woods
near the victim's place.

00:11:57.625 --> 00:11:58.225
Captain Sun,

00:11:58.784 --> 00:12:01.025
we've been here for days now.

00:12:01.145 --> 00:12:03.544
Why has Captain Leng
been wearing sunglasses all the time?

00:12:04.505 --> 00:12:05.385
Look at you, Zhou.

00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:07.385
What's with all the questions?

00:12:08.304 --> 00:12:10.625
Captain Leng's eyes
were injured during a mission.

00:12:10.745 --> 00:12:11.584
He avoids light.

00:12:12.145 --> 00:12:14.465
That's why
he has to wear glasses day and night.

00:12:15.345 --> 00:12:16.465
But they're not sunglasses.

00:12:16.544 --> 00:12:17.584
They don't block his view.

00:12:18.465 --> 00:12:20.105
So, you...

00:12:24.544 --> 00:12:25.265
Captain Leng.

00:12:27.985 --> 00:12:28.865
We got something.

00:12:35.145 --> 00:12:37.824
The packaging colors
of these condoms are all different.

00:12:38.025 --> 00:12:39.625
They weren't tossed on the same day.

00:12:40.304 --> 00:12:41.025
Here too.

00:12:50.584 --> 00:12:51.505
Come look at this.

00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:30.304
There's a telescope here.

00:13:51.424 --> 00:13:53.385
It offers a clear view
into the victim's bedroom.

00:15:05.704 --> 00:15:11.385
No valuable fingerprints found
on the packaging of these four condoms.

00:15:11.824 --> 00:15:15.265
The user was likely wearing gloves
when handling them.

00:15:15.544 --> 00:15:19.145
I found latex and talcum powder traces
on the tree bark.

00:15:19.424 --> 00:15:20.745
Consistent with medical gloves.

00:15:21.145 --> 00:15:22.145
So I conclude

00:15:22.145 --> 00:15:24.704
that the suspect
climbed the tree wearing gloves.

00:15:24.704 --> 00:15:26.625
Specifically, medical latex gloves.

00:15:27.664 --> 00:15:29.865
That matches Ye's earlier theory.

00:15:30.345 --> 00:15:32.304
The suspect is meticulous, organized,

00:15:32.304 --> 00:15:33.544
and highly cautious.

00:15:33.944 --> 00:15:35.584
Given those traits, the medical gloves,

00:15:35.584 --> 00:15:37.345
and the skill with a scalpel,

00:15:37.584 --> 00:15:39.865
it's highly likely the suspect
has a medical background.

00:15:39.865 --> 00:15:42.025
He may also have hobbies
like hiking or rock climbing.

00:15:42.544 --> 00:15:46.424
But both Wang Xiaole and Wu Da
graduated from medical school.

00:15:46.424 --> 00:15:48.025
And they both worked in related fields.

00:15:48.704 --> 00:15:50.544
Within their social circles,

00:15:50.544 --> 00:15:53.184
many are doctors
or have medical backgrounds.

00:15:53.625 --> 00:15:55.225
I think that scope is still too broad.

00:16:55.304 --> 00:16:56.064
Alright.

00:16:56.625 --> 00:16:58.225
You've paid respects to my parents.

00:17:09.544 --> 00:17:11.544
I know you don't stand on ceremony,

00:17:15.624 --> 00:17:16.544
but this outfit

00:17:18.624 --> 00:17:19.665
is a bit much.

00:17:19.864 --> 00:17:23.824
(Beloved Father Chen Yiqing's Tomb
Beloved Mother Liu Rongdan's Tomb)

00:17:23.824 --> 00:17:24.945
They are always in my heart.

00:17:26.705 --> 00:17:28.584
The rest is just formality.

00:17:30.104 --> 00:17:31.344
It's for the living to see.

00:17:34.144 --> 00:17:34.905
Besides,

00:17:35.824 --> 00:17:37.344
I need to stand out.

00:17:38.425 --> 00:17:39.665
So they don't lose track of me.

00:17:41.824 --> 00:17:42.425
Let's go.

00:18:04.784 --> 00:18:07.505
No word from Bao Hei
these past few days.

00:18:08.784 --> 00:18:10.225
Probably busy digging graves.

00:18:11.624 --> 00:18:14.304
Once we get past this hurdle,
we'll meet Bao Hei, right?

00:18:14.745 --> 00:18:15.544
Hard to say.

00:18:16.465 --> 00:18:20.225
Bao Hei has a reputation
for his cold heart and cruel hands.

00:18:20.745 --> 00:18:23.344
Earning his real trust won't be easy.

00:18:24.185 --> 00:18:25.905
Trust from someone like him? Forget it.

00:18:26.905 --> 00:18:28.465
To get him to cooperate,

00:18:29.104 --> 00:18:30.465
we need to intimidate him.

00:18:31.384 --> 00:18:32.104
Plainly speaking,

00:18:32.624 --> 00:18:35.225
we're not the only source around
these days.

00:18:36.745 --> 00:18:40.225
But an ex-boyfriend
who's an active-duty cop

00:18:40.705 --> 00:18:43.304
is not something
just anyone can produce.

00:18:47.344 --> 00:18:48.225
Are you sure?

00:18:51.064 --> 00:18:53.985
Should you reconsider?

00:18:55.584 --> 00:18:58.505
Dragging this out with Bao Hei
benefits no one.

00:18:59.425 --> 00:19:01.824
Besides, he started this whole thing.

00:19:01.945 --> 00:19:02.745
We can't avoid it.

00:19:03.465 --> 00:19:05.544
If we avoid it,
he'll only get more suspicious.

00:19:07.104 --> 00:19:10.784
We might as well go with the flow

00:19:11.784 --> 00:19:14.265
and let Bao Hei see
what we're capable of.

00:19:20.864 --> 00:19:21.945
You hate him that much?

00:19:30.225 --> 00:19:31.505
Not running into him

00:19:32.624 --> 00:19:33.705
all these years was fine.

00:19:35.544 --> 00:19:36.864
But fate brought us together.

00:19:38.185 --> 00:19:39.064
Well,

00:19:41.544 --> 00:19:44.064
how could I possibly
let him get away easily

00:19:44.945 --> 00:19:45.945
and live so happily?

00:20:09.624 --> 00:20:13.070
(Sexual Wellness Products)

00:20:14.584 --> 00:20:15.384
Check up ahead.

00:20:15.384 --> 00:20:15.945
Okay.

00:20:23.025 --> 00:20:24.705
Do you have this product here?

00:20:26.064 --> 00:20:28.225
This one isn't currently sold here.

00:20:28.225 --> 00:20:30.584
It's one
of those free contraceptive supplies.

00:20:31.824 --> 00:20:33.864
No, we don't have this one here.

00:20:34.104 --> 00:20:36.025
From what I know,
it's not available nearby.

00:20:37.344 --> 00:20:37.985
Thank you.

00:20:51.624 --> 00:20:52.425
Master,

00:20:52.985 --> 00:20:53.824
the pharmacy staff

00:20:53.824 --> 00:20:55.304
said this condom isn't for sale.

00:20:55.705 --> 00:20:58.064
It's handed out freely across the city.

00:20:59.185 --> 00:21:02.265
Mainly at county or district
family planning departments,

00:21:02.544 --> 00:21:04.265
hospitals, and neighborhood committees.

00:21:05.025 --> 00:21:05.905
In that case,

00:21:05.985 --> 00:21:11.425
we can trace the source
and look into its distribution process.

No.

I'm on a case.

to become a police officer.

Yumo, I...

00:22:55.384 --> 00:22:57.185
After that incident, I changed my name.

00:22:58.225 --> 00:22:59.584

No, thanks.

00:23:33.064 --> 00:23:33.864
Are you sure?

00:23:37.624 --> 00:23:38.505
I'll head out then.

00:23:46.265 --> 00:23:47.265
Let's exchange WeChat.

00:23:47.465 --> 00:23:48.465

Okay.

Should arrive in a few days.

00:30:32.185 --> 00:30:33.064
They've arrived?

00:30:33.384 --> 00:30:34.505
Don't open them yet.

00:30:34.505 --> 00:30:35.985
The screws inside are sharp.

00:30:36.265 --> 00:30:38.265
I'll install them on the wall
when I'm home.

00:30:40.905 --> 00:30:42.384
That's Captain Leng calling.

00:30:42.384 --> 00:30:43.425
Must be work.

00:30:43.505 --> 00:30:44.505
I need to go.

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:49.185
(Forensic Imagery Room)

00:30:49.185 --> 00:30:49.945
Captain Leng,

00:30:50.864 --> 00:30:55.384
I found no valuable clues
at the south gate.

00:30:55.985 --> 00:30:56.584
Right.

00:30:57.344 --> 00:31:00.384
Same for the woods
outside the north gate.

00:31:01.185 --> 00:31:02.665
Too little useful evidence.

00:31:02.665 --> 00:31:03.985
I'm still looking.

00:31:06.708 --> 00:31:12.185
(Yunxi Medical University)

00:31:12.185 --> 00:31:12.945
Ye,

00:31:13.304 --> 00:31:14.985
sorry to keep you waiting.

00:31:15.104 --> 00:31:17.225
(File Bag)
Look, these old files

00:31:17.465 --> 00:31:19.824
are stored
in the old teaching building's archive.

00:31:20.185 --> 00:31:22.784
We haven't digitized them yet.

00:31:23.064 --> 00:31:24.425
Hence the delay.

00:31:24.905 --> 00:31:26.384
You're too kind, Mr. Liu.

00:31:26.705 --> 00:31:28.784
I should thank you
for assisting our investigation.

00:31:29.265 --> 00:31:30.384
(Graduate Registration Form)
My pleasure.

00:31:30.384 --> 00:31:31.425
You may not know.

00:31:31.784 --> 00:31:36.384
I was Wu Da and Xiaole's
homeroom teacher.

00:31:38.025 --> 00:31:41.025
When Wu Da applied
to transfer departments,

00:31:41.064 --> 00:31:43.304
(Wu Da's Profile)
I advised him not to act impulsively.

00:31:44.225 --> 00:31:46.344
Ours is a top university.

00:31:46.544 --> 00:31:48.705
Getting into our department isn't easy.

00:31:49.465 --> 00:31:52.304
I advised him
to cherish this opportunity.

00:31:52.304 --> 00:31:55.025
But he refused on the spot.

00:31:55.265 --> 00:31:59.584
He even said he wasn't cut out
for medicine at all,

00:31:59.985 --> 00:32:04.344
and Xiaole was the only reason
he chose clinical.

00:32:04.864 --> 00:32:05.705
- That kid...
- Sir,

00:32:06.104 --> 00:32:07.945
based on your understanding of Wu Da,

00:32:08.425 --> 00:32:11.225
could he achieve such precision
with the incision?

00:32:11.225 --> 00:32:11.824
Wu Da?

00:32:12.104 --> 00:32:15.265
He couldn't hold the scalpel properly
during training.

00:32:15.425 --> 00:32:16.505
This photo

00:32:16.624 --> 00:32:19.064
shows a clean, neat incision

00:32:19.225 --> 00:32:20.265
with perfectly even force.

00:32:20.465 --> 00:32:23.265
Without years of practice
and solid fundamentals,

00:32:23.465 --> 00:32:24.784
one simply couldn't have done it.

00:32:29.544 --> 00:32:30.144
Sir,

00:32:31.225 --> 00:32:34.824
Wu Da received a disciplinary demerit
while at school?

00:32:36.745 --> 00:32:39.624
It was for fighting
with another student.

00:32:39.824 --> 00:32:42.384
The kids acted impulsively,

00:32:42.864 --> 00:32:46.025
but actually,
they were very close friends.

00:32:46.104 --> 00:32:48.705
They were inseparable all day long.

00:32:55.304 --> 00:32:55.985
Ye,

00:32:56.624 --> 00:32:58.465
how are your parents doing overseas?

00:33:00.384 --> 00:33:01.185
They're doing fine.

00:33:02.265 --> 00:33:04.265
When you talk to them next time,

00:33:04.384 --> 00:33:07.104
tell them
we old friends still think of them.

00:33:07.584 --> 00:33:08.784
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

00:33:09.185 --> 00:33:09.784
By the way,

00:33:10.104 --> 00:33:12.384
could you please help me find out

00:33:12.384 --> 00:33:14.784
the specific details
of Wu Da's fight and demerit?

00:33:15.025 --> 00:33:18.185
No problem. I'll tell you
as soon as I find anything.

00:33:18.265 --> 00:33:18.864
Thank you.

00:33:19.144 --> 00:33:20.104
Take care. I'm off.

00:33:20.104 --> 00:33:21.624
Alright, take care.

00:33:37.505 --> 00:33:41.425
I went to a movie
with Little Zhao that day.

00:33:45.225 --> 00:33:46.745
But I used your name to invite her.

00:33:46.905 --> 00:33:48.265
You don't mind, do you?

00:33:51.025 --> 00:33:52.425
Can't you rely on yourself?

00:33:52.665 --> 00:33:54.144
I do want to rely on myself, bro.

00:33:54.144 --> 00:33:55.544
But I can't get her out like that.

00:33:55.544 --> 00:33:56.384
She won't come.

00:34:01.624 --> 00:34:02.784
Just tell me,

00:34:02.985 --> 00:34:06.784
is there even the slightest chance
between you two?

00:34:07.185 --> 00:34:08.064
There isn't.

00:34:08.064 --> 00:34:09.825
Okay then, that puts my mind at ease.

00:34:10.064 --> 00:34:13.104
Actually, the atmosphere
during the movie was pretty good.

00:34:14.144 --> 00:34:15.064
It looked promising.

00:34:15.224 --> 00:34:18.025
But unfortunately,
I had to leave halfway through.

00:34:28.345 --> 00:34:30.584
How about doing another favor for me?

00:34:31.744 --> 00:34:32.584
What now?

00:34:33.985 --> 00:34:35.945
I invited Little Zhao
for a late-night snack.

00:34:35.945 --> 00:34:36.785
I said you'll go too.

00:34:36.785 --> 00:34:38.785
And she just replied, saying yes.

00:34:43.192 --> 00:34:46.985
(No-Name Diner)

00:34:46.985 --> 00:34:47.785
Jing.

00:34:48.624 --> 00:34:50.624
You're here. Perfect, it's all ready.

00:34:50.624 --> 00:34:51.104
Great.

00:34:51.104 --> 00:34:51.744
Dig in.

00:34:51.744 --> 00:34:52.505
- Thanks.
- Jing.

00:34:52.985 --> 00:34:53.752
Here, Little Zhao.

00:34:53.905 --> 00:34:54.945
Is she your girlfriend?

00:34:54.945 --> 00:34:55.544
A friend.

00:34:55.544 --> 00:34:56.505
- No.
- Not my girlfriend.

00:34:57.064 --> 00:34:58.144
- Sit.
- Eat up.

00:34:58.144 --> 00:34:59.305
Holler if you need me.

00:34:59.305 --> 00:35:00.264
Got it.

00:35:01.264 --> 00:35:03.825
So this is the amazing restaurant
you keep mentioning?

00:35:04.184 --> 00:35:05.785
The place looks pretty ordinary.

00:35:06.305 --> 00:35:08.184
And the dishes
seem like regular home cooking.

00:35:09.505 --> 00:35:10.544
Let me try this.

00:35:11.465 --> 00:35:12.385
That's delicious.

00:35:13.544 --> 00:35:14.785
I think it's quite tasty.

00:35:14.785 --> 00:35:15.785
Better than my cooking.

00:35:16.584 --> 00:35:17.345
It's good.

00:35:17.664 --> 00:35:18.985
If you say it's good, then it is.

00:35:23.785 --> 00:35:24.465
Tasty.

00:35:36.144 --> 00:35:37.264
Captain Qin, you're here.

00:35:37.264 --> 00:35:37.905
Is it ready?

00:35:37.905 --> 00:35:38.664
All ready.

00:35:38.664 --> 00:35:39.624
Come on in and sit down.

00:35:39.624 --> 00:35:41.505
I'll serve the noodles right away.
Just sit.

00:35:41.624 --> 00:35:42.425
- Okay.
- Right away.

00:35:42.425 --> 00:35:43.144
- Jing.
- Come on.

00:35:44.144 --> 00:35:44.865
What's going on?

00:35:44.865 --> 00:35:46.104
Serve the noodles, Shan.

00:35:46.624 --> 00:35:47.264
Qian.

00:35:48.744 --> 00:35:49.224
Long.

00:35:49.224 --> 00:35:50.025
Serve the noodles.

00:35:50.025 --> 00:35:50.985
Long, you're here too.

00:35:51.104 --> 00:35:51.664
You're here.

00:35:51.664 --> 00:35:52.184
Enjoy.

00:35:52.184 --> 00:35:53.465
Qian and Long, you're here too.

00:35:54.584 --> 00:35:56.025
- You're here.
- You must be starving.

00:35:56.025 --> 00:35:56.704
Eat your food.

00:35:56.704 --> 00:35:57.305
Here.

00:35:57.945 --> 00:35:59.104
- Free noodles.
- Qian. Long.

00:35:59.104 --> 00:35:59.704
Come on.

00:36:00.184 --> 00:36:01.305
Everyone, eat up.

00:36:02.465 --> 00:36:03.385
- Noodles.
- Serve this table.

00:36:03.584 --> 00:36:04.144
Here.

00:36:04.144 --> 00:36:04.825
Coming right up.

00:36:09.144 --> 00:36:09.744
Here.

00:36:11.025 --> 00:36:12.184
Give this to them first.

00:36:15.064 --> 00:36:16.704
How about we find another place?

00:36:17.184 --> 00:36:17.985
What's wrong?

00:36:18.825 --> 00:36:23.025
I feel creeped out even though
I haven't done anything wrong.

00:36:23.025 --> 00:36:23.905
It's no big deal.

00:36:23.905 --> 00:36:25.144
They're the Public Order Unit.

00:36:25.624 --> 00:36:26.505
The power of justice.

00:36:26.825 --> 00:36:28.465
There must be another operation tonight.

00:36:29.704 --> 00:36:30.584
There's an operation?

00:36:44.345 --> 00:36:45.385
(Team One, Team One.)

00:36:45.385 --> 00:36:46.664
(Team Two, Team Two, move out.)

00:36:47.064 --> 00:36:47.905
Copy. Moving out.

00:36:48.025 --> 00:36:48.945
- Copy that.
- Copy that.

00:36:48.945 --> 00:36:49.465
- Copy that.
- Move.

00:36:49.465 --> 00:36:49.985
Let's go.

00:36:49.985 --> 00:36:50.744
Let's go.

00:36:51.025 --> 00:36:52.184
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:37:22.584 --> 00:37:23.865
What's happening tonight?

00:37:23.865 --> 00:37:24.865
Why the rush?

00:37:26.305 --> 00:37:27.345
Liu and Shan, come here.

00:37:28.184 --> 00:37:28.905
Clean those up.

00:37:28.905 --> 00:37:30.425
They probably won't be back soon.

00:37:31.624 --> 00:37:32.465
Grab that bucket.

00:37:32.945 --> 00:37:35.785
Pour everything into the bucket

00:37:36.224 --> 00:37:38.505
for the stray cats, dogs, and such.

00:37:39.425 --> 00:37:40.264
Look at them.

00:37:40.385 --> 00:37:41.624
Put it on the table for now.

00:37:48.345 --> 00:37:49.224
- Hello, Master.
- Hello, Lei.

00:37:53.345 --> 00:37:53.985
Coming.

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:58.232
(No-Name Diner)

00:38:03.144 --> 00:38:04.584
What's going on tonight?

00:38:07.505 --> 00:38:08.305
Just sit.

00:38:10.184 --> 00:38:11.465
You'll get used to it.

00:38:12.905 --> 00:38:15.664
That's the nature of their job.
They leave at a moment's notice.

00:38:17.945 --> 00:38:19.264
How about I join you?

00:38:19.465 --> 00:38:20.664
Or it'll all go to waste.

00:38:20.664 --> 00:38:21.345
Okay.

00:38:21.865 --> 00:38:22.664
Let's eat.

00:38:26.465 --> 00:38:27.264
Ms. Jing,

00:38:28.744 --> 00:38:30.905
does Ye Qian come here often?

00:38:32.544 --> 00:38:33.505
He comes often.

00:38:37.584 --> 00:38:42.264
Has he brought other girls here before?

00:38:45.025 --> 00:38:47.985
Anyway, you're the first girl
they've brought here.

00:38:54.945 --> 00:38:55.505
Ms. Jing,

00:38:56.144 --> 00:38:58.584
is your family in the same line of work?

00:39:00.544 --> 00:39:03.025
My husband, Jiao Lei,
is their colleague.

00:39:03.025 --> 00:39:03.985
He's also a cop.

00:39:05.865 --> 00:39:07.184
My son used to be a soldier.

00:39:07.425 --> 00:39:08.465
A border guard.

00:39:09.064 --> 00:39:09.865
That's cool.

00:39:10.825 --> 00:39:12.224
Quite a handsome young man.

00:39:13.224 --> 00:39:14.664
Lots of girls liked him.

00:39:18.985 --> 00:39:20.905
But he died on duty five years ago.

00:39:24.624 --> 00:39:26.704
I've worked in food service
since before my son.

00:39:28.224 --> 00:39:30.025
I wanted to open my own restaurant

00:39:30.785 --> 00:39:32.025
to honor my son

00:39:32.305 --> 00:39:34.064
and keep myself occupied.

00:39:35.425 --> 00:39:38.985
Jiao's unit was setting up a canteen
for field personnel back then,

00:39:39.465 --> 00:39:41.064
and the leaders sympathized with me,

00:39:41.345 --> 00:39:42.744
so they gave us priority

00:39:43.104 --> 00:39:44.345
and hence this restaurant.

00:39:45.465 --> 00:39:48.144
We sometimes provide meals
for sanitation workers.

00:39:48.264 --> 00:39:49.465
It's volunteer-based too.

00:39:54.465 --> 00:39:55.945
People need something to hold onto.

00:39:56.785 --> 00:39:58.785
It feels good to do something
for that purpose.

00:39:59.624 --> 00:40:02.704
Can I come help next time then?

00:40:04.144 --> 00:40:05.184
Of course.

00:40:06.144 --> 00:40:06.785
You're welcome.

00:40:06.985 --> 00:40:07.785
Alright.

00:40:08.744 --> 00:40:09.544
Eat more.

00:40:11.744 --> 00:40:12.544
You eat too.

00:40:14.825 --> 00:40:15.505
Slow down.

00:40:43.544 --> 00:40:45.785
Is this the old chemical factory's
discharge pool?

00:40:46.064 --> 00:40:47.305
Why the strong smell?

00:40:48.704 --> 00:40:52.744
This whole area
used to be a chemical factory.

00:40:53.184 --> 00:40:55.064
Later, the factory relocated.
The land was sold.

00:40:55.064 --> 00:40:56.544
It's been left abandoned ever since.

00:40:56.664 --> 00:40:59.025
Now it's entirely a garbage dump.

00:40:59.584 --> 00:41:01.385
If it hadn't become a dump,

00:41:01.584 --> 00:41:03.224
I wouldn't have found this place.

00:41:04.985 --> 00:41:06.144
See that surveillance camera?

00:41:07.664 --> 00:41:10.584
Coming through the woods,
there's only this one camera.

00:41:11.025 --> 00:41:12.425
The camera was installed

00:41:12.425 --> 00:41:16.905
by the city sanitation department
to catch trucks illegally dumping trash.

00:41:16.905 --> 00:41:18.505
Didn't expect it
to help us out big time.

00:41:21.064 --> 00:41:24.584
Is the person
who threw something into the pond

00:41:24.704 --> 00:41:28.785
the same one who appeared
at the south gate of the community?

00:41:29.385 --> 00:41:29.985
Looks like it.

00:41:30.945 --> 00:41:36.224
But the camera's resolution is lacking.

00:41:36.224 --> 00:41:37.865
We need to analyze it thoroughly.

00:42:03.985 --> 00:42:04.825
Found it.

00:42:07.584 --> 00:42:08.385
Found it.
