WEBVTT

00:00:00.365 --> 00:00:02.498
I lost you along with my memory.

00:00:03.152 --> 00:00:04.415
But I will find it.

00:00:04.618 --> 00:00:06.121
Then hurry up and find me.

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:11.715
Your lover is Thunphob.

00:00:13.228 --> 00:00:14.228
Not me.

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:17.721
What Thunphob did wrong was using my name

00:00:20.038 --> 00:00:21.118
when he’s in love with you.

00:00:22.275 --> 00:00:23.728
I’m not mad that you fooled me.

00:00:24.141 --> 00:00:25.441
But I’m angry right now

00:00:25.748 --> 00:00:27.028
because you made me love you.

00:00:35.362 --> 00:00:36.441
If anyone asks anything

00:00:36.588 --> 00:00:38.028
just say I’m unwell, okay?

00:00:39.602 --> 00:00:40.188
Look.

00:00:40.542 --> 00:00:43.021
Don’t you think Dad will find out?

00:00:44.128 --> 00:00:45.728
If you don’t say it, Dad won’t find out.

00:00:47.818 --> 00:00:49.545
Come on, Tan.

00:00:49.935 --> 00:00:51.621
No one’s going to bother a sickly boy.

00:00:52.515 --> 00:00:53.815
Or if I ever get caught,

00:00:54.408 --> 00:00:55.695
I’ll just say my name’s Tankhun.

00:00:57.642 --> 00:00:58.642
I’ll get going.

00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:00.281
Wait.

00:01:01.448 --> 00:01:02.448
Let me really ask you

00:01:04.355 --> 00:01:05.571
When you leave home every day,

00:01:06.148 --> 00:01:07.148
where do you go?

00:01:07.195 --> 00:01:09.221
To find my beautiful melody.

00:01:09.894 --> 00:01:10.894
I’ll get going.

00:01:17.522 --> 00:01:18.842
You have to come again next year.

00:01:20.008 --> 00:01:21.008
Come again every year.

00:01:22.568 --> 00:01:23.618
On Christmas day,

00:01:25.482 --> 00:01:26.495
we’ll meet here.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.148
But after that year,

00:01:41.008 --> 00:01:42.648
Thunphob couldn’t contact you ever again.

00:01:51.622 --> 00:01:53.421
It was probably
when I got into an accident

00:01:55.868 --> 00:01:57.308
and lost my memory.

00:01:59.728 --> 00:02:01.318
But he never stopped looking for you.

00:02:04.942 --> 00:02:06.708
He came back to Thailand 5 years ago.

00:02:08.602 --> 00:02:09.795
He wanted to look for you.

00:02:11.822 --> 00:02:12.822
To live with you.

00:02:16.662 --> 00:02:18.215
I thought he would be happy.

00:02:21.562 --> 00:02:22.568
But in the end…

00:02:31.415 --> 00:02:33.115
I found him dead.

00:02:48.108 --> 00:02:49.748
1 MONTH AGO.

00:02:50.168 --> 00:02:51.361
There’s a trace of contusion.

00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:53.851
There’s a contusion mark
on the occipital area.

00:02:53.875 --> 00:02:56.101
Seems like he’s been hit
by something solid.

00:02:56.808 --> 00:03:00.541
I can’t tell if it’s from getting attacked
or from a car accident.

00:03:01.568 --> 00:03:03.011
If it were a normal accident,

00:03:04.508 --> 00:03:06.208
the contusion would be in the front

00:03:06.915 --> 00:03:08.235
or on the top of the head

00:03:08.628 --> 00:03:09.955
when the car runs into the water.

00:03:10.588 --> 00:03:12.215
But there’s only one mark

00:03:12.608 --> 00:03:13.635
on the occipital area.

00:03:15.248 --> 00:03:16.528
I’m not sure if it’s a contusion

00:03:18.055 --> 00:03:21.615
caused by a natural trajectory
of an accident.

00:03:27.815 --> 00:03:30.508
The car doesn’t have any dents or marks.

00:03:31.428 --> 00:03:32.988
It doesn’t seem like a normal accident.

00:03:35.208 --> 00:03:36.328
I suspect that

00:03:37.701 --> 00:03:41.015
someone might have staged this.

00:03:50.408 --> 00:03:52.088
We found this with the remains of the car.

00:04:11.462 --> 00:04:12.921
Someone brought his death to him.

00:04:16.048 --> 00:04:17.048
And I

00:04:19.821 --> 00:04:20.975
will find that person.

00:05:03.268 --> 00:05:04.268
Thunphob.

00:05:06.282 --> 00:05:07.282
Thank you.

00:05:11.095 --> 00:05:12.095
Sorry.

00:05:20.722 --> 00:05:21.762
Best of luck.

00:05:25.522 --> 00:05:26.522
Goodbye.

00:07:26.675 --> 00:07:28.355
How long have you been close
with Muenmile?

00:07:36.408 --> 00:07:37.408
Why?

00:07:39.362 --> 00:07:40.415
Are you suspecting him?

00:07:42.162 --> 00:07:43.295
I’m not suspecting anyone.

00:07:44.648 --> 00:07:46.215
But from all the cases I’ve dealt with,

00:07:48.202 --> 00:07:49.721
the one who seems least suspicious

00:07:51.988 --> 00:07:53.161
tends to be hiding something.

00:07:57.715 --> 00:07:59.128
Do you not trust me either?

00:08:01.128 --> 00:08:02.161
The people close to you,

00:08:03.295 --> 00:08:04.295
the more you trust them,

00:08:05.702 --> 00:08:06.942
the more you have to watch out.

00:08:09.415 --> 00:08:10.468
Does “watching out”

00:08:13.268 --> 00:08:15.415
mean choosing to be the offender?

00:08:19.955 --> 00:08:21.145
I’m just curious.

00:08:23.428 --> 00:08:25.321
Just to investigate your brother’s death,

00:08:27.888 --> 00:08:29.988
did you have to take
our relationship this far?

00:08:34.842 --> 00:08:36.718
Thunphob wasn’t just your younger brother.

00:08:38.794 --> 00:08:40.394
He was my lover too.

00:08:43.162 --> 00:08:44.695
Do you really not feel anything?

00:08:46.415 --> 00:08:47.718
For doing that

00:08:48.575 --> 00:08:50.061
to your brother’s lover?

00:08:56.148 --> 00:08:57.148
I…

00:09:00.321 --> 00:09:01.321
I have feelings for you.

00:09:03.102 --> 00:09:04.102
That’s it.

00:09:05.595 --> 00:09:06.715
That’s even more disgusting.

00:09:25.435 --> 00:09:26.921
Can you answer me now?

00:09:27.515 --> 00:09:29.628
Why do you refuse to tell
anyone about Thunphob?

00:09:39.565 --> 00:09:41.708
What sort of lie did you tell
my friend this time?

00:09:44.563 --> 00:09:46.221
You can actually say it now.

00:09:46.568 --> 00:09:48.301
You also think Botpleng didn’t lie.

00:09:50.402 --> 00:09:51.402
I see.

00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:53.708
So you refuse to tell anyone

00:09:54.222 --> 00:09:56.062
because you’re on the same
boat as your brother

00:09:56.422 --> 00:09:57.808
to approach Pleng, right?

00:10:01.122 --> 00:10:02.122
To approach me?

00:10:04.135 --> 00:10:06.215
When you say someone brought
Thunphob’s death to him,

00:10:08.255 --> 00:10:09.255
you were suspecting me?

00:10:10.028 --> 00:10:11.028
In every case,

00:10:11.848 --> 00:10:15.221
the suspect tends to be
the closest person.

00:10:18.555 --> 00:10:19.808
So I looked for you.

00:10:20.747 --> 00:10:21.747
Approached you.

00:10:24.188 --> 00:10:25.245
And I’m confident

00:10:26.415 --> 00:10:28.221
that you didn’t fake your memory loss.

00:10:29.495 --> 00:10:30.815
In your memory,

00:10:32.261 --> 00:10:33.608
there’s no Thunphob in there.

00:10:40.962 --> 00:10:43.301
I will bring the memory
with Thunphob back.

00:10:46.635 --> 00:10:47.755
I’ll join the investigation.

00:10:48.268 --> 00:10:49.268
What?

00:10:51.988 --> 00:10:53.715
Whether as a suspect

00:10:54.615 --> 00:10:55.775
or as Thunphob’s lover.

00:10:57.948 --> 00:10:58.948
Isn’t it me

00:11:00.015 --> 00:11:01.735
who knows best about
the truth of this case?

00:12:07.308 --> 00:12:08.868
Are you allergic to nuts like Thunphob?

00:12:13.915 --> 00:12:15.601
I saw the cookie’s wrapper on the counter

00:12:17.135 --> 00:12:18.601
so I knew it contained nuts.

00:12:20.742 --> 00:12:21.742
So I…

00:12:27.134 --> 00:12:29.414
I shouldn’t have tried to find faults
in someone like you.

00:12:38.238 --> 00:12:39.521
You can still stay here.

00:12:46.787 --> 00:12:47.798
In what status?

00:12:53.218 --> 00:12:54.218
Thunphob’s boyfriend?

00:12:57.586 --> 00:12:58.586
Or Tankhun’s?

00:13:07.298 --> 00:13:08.883
But probably not Tankhun’s boyfriend.

00:13:10.326 --> 00:13:11.553
Because what you did to me

00:13:14.932 --> 00:13:17.452
was all because you wanted to find out
the truth about Thunphob.

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:21.310
Pleng.

00:13:24.356 --> 00:13:25.443
I already said it.

00:13:26.378 --> 00:13:27.824
They were just lies

00:13:29.715 --> 00:13:31.435
that you wanted them
to make me feel better.

00:13:32.935 --> 00:13:33.935
And you

00:13:36.535 --> 00:13:37.615
don’t feel any better,

00:13:40.288 --> 00:13:41.288
not even a bit?

00:13:45.682 --> 00:13:47.621
If what you did was pretending
to be Thunphob,

00:13:55.481 --> 00:13:56.481
I love Thunphob.

00:14:38.745 --> 00:14:42.017
JEN, I’M NOT GOING BACK TO THE UK ANYMORE.
I’LL BUILD A HOMESTAY HERE WITH BOTPLENG.

00:14:42.041 --> 00:14:44.048
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
DO YOU THINK THIS PLACE IS NICE?

00:14:50.272 --> 00:14:51.808
I don’t talk about Thunphob

00:14:52.895 --> 00:14:54.808
because we lost our parents

00:14:55.335 --> 00:14:57.115
and now there are only 3 of us left.

00:14:58.515 --> 00:15:01.648
Then my dearest brother died.

00:15:02.948 --> 00:15:05.328
Just when he gets to really live
his own life.

00:15:10.913 --> 00:15:12.315
The police couldn’t find anything.

00:15:13.408 --> 00:15:14.605
So we came back to Thailand

00:15:15.115 --> 00:15:16.835
to investigate Thunphob’s case
by ourselves.

00:15:21.888 --> 00:15:22.888
Use me.

00:15:25.535 --> 00:15:27.135
My memory might help you guys figure out

00:15:27.895 --> 00:15:31.015
what happened to Thunphob 5 years ago.

00:15:38.222 --> 00:15:40.441
(There’s a place I want you to go.)

00:15:41.848 --> 00:15:44.628
(Thunphob sent us a postcard saying)

00:15:45.228 --> 00:15:47.515
(he wanted to build a homestay there
with you.)

00:16:38.748 --> 00:16:39.748
Have you eaten?

00:16:42.098 --> 00:16:44.635
Stop exploiting my memory with Thunphob.

00:16:45.368 --> 00:16:46.368
I never said

00:16:47.888 --> 00:16:49.561
that this is Thunphob’s memory.

00:16:58.138 --> 00:16:59.781
It might look like a cassava

00:17:01.148 --> 00:17:02.661
but it’s actually a 5-minute cassava.

00:17:03.475 --> 00:17:04.921
It’s basically an edible cassava.

00:17:07.582 --> 00:17:09.101
It might look a bit burnt.

00:17:11.545 --> 00:17:12.545
I’m sorry.

00:17:14.418 --> 00:17:17.288
What if it’s burnt through and is bitter?

00:17:18.101 --> 00:17:19.101
What would you do?

00:17:19.382 --> 00:17:20.382
If it’s so

00:17:22.028 --> 00:17:24.015
then I’ll find a new way
to grill it next time.

00:17:26.168 --> 00:17:27.768
That is, if you give me a chance, Pleng.

00:17:31.861 --> 00:17:35.121
Are you sure that it’s safe this time?

00:18:05.995 --> 00:18:07.241
RAI YAI YAEM HOMESTAY.

00:18:09.515 --> 00:18:10.515
How is it?

00:18:11.215 --> 00:18:12.298
Can you remember anything?

00:18:23.208 --> 00:18:24.888
Oh, what brings you here?

00:18:26.082 --> 00:18:27.082
Hello.

00:18:27.782 --> 00:18:28.782
Hello, Grandma.

00:18:29.492 --> 00:18:30.492
We happen to

00:18:31.722 --> 00:18:33.215
have something to ask you.

00:18:33.661 --> 00:18:34.661
Alright.

00:18:40.122 --> 00:18:43.215
Do you know the person in the picture?

00:18:45.361 --> 00:18:47.421
Thunphob used to stay here
for a long while.

00:18:51.515 --> 00:18:53.135
And…

00:18:53.941 --> 00:18:54.941
You are…

00:18:56.642 --> 00:18:58.728
I’m Thun’s older brother.

00:19:01.195 --> 00:19:02.195
And this is…

00:19:02.495 --> 00:19:03.728
I’m Thunphob’s boyfriend.

00:19:04.428 --> 00:19:05.428
You…

00:19:07.095 --> 00:19:09.868
Oh, so it’s you.

00:19:10.002 --> 00:19:11.968
Thunphob mentioned a lot about you.

00:19:13.115 --> 00:19:14.755
Is Thunphob doing well?

00:19:26.562 --> 00:19:27.805
Unbelievable.

00:19:28.118 --> 00:19:31.928
I thought this place had found its owner.

00:19:32.628 --> 00:19:33.928
Grandma, what if I want to buy–

00:19:33.968 --> 00:19:35.101
Oh, there’s no need.

00:19:35.162 --> 00:19:36.202
I’m well off.

00:19:36.748 --> 00:19:39.208
I’m here because I’m independent.

00:19:39.408 --> 00:19:41.515
I like that there’s so much to do here.

00:19:41.854 --> 00:19:44.121
But a few years ago, when I met Thun,

00:19:44.268 --> 00:19:45.135
he said he liked this place

00:19:45.162 --> 00:19:47.802
so I was willing to give it to him
even if it is just for 1-2 Baht.

00:19:50.935 --> 00:19:54.161
No wonder Thunphob liked it.

00:19:54.828 --> 00:19:56.615
Thunphob liked to say that

00:19:57.067 --> 00:19:59.208
when the leaves brush against each other,

00:19:59.388 --> 00:20:00.508
it sounds like a melody.

00:20:00.762 --> 00:20:05.015
At least the person Thunphob wanted
to show this place to is already here.

00:20:10.315 --> 00:20:11.555
Grandma, I’m hungry!

00:20:11.675 --> 00:20:13.735
Alright, I’ll get the rice cooked.

00:20:15.315 --> 00:20:17.055
Let us help you.

00:20:17.601 --> 00:20:18.921
Sure, go ahead.

00:20:38.314 --> 00:20:39.314
I’ll do it.

00:21:33.988 --> 00:21:34.815
How is it going?

00:21:34.922 --> 00:21:35.922
Huh?

00:21:38.208 --> 00:21:39.908
Oh, almost done.

00:21:46.608 --> 00:21:47.608
Why are you smiling?

00:21:48.155 --> 00:21:49.155
Because you’re smiling.

00:21:50.901 --> 00:21:52.721
I wasn’t smiling.
I was laughing at your face.

00:21:54.355 --> 00:21:56.235
Move.
If you don’t know how to do it, then move.

00:22:15.268 --> 00:22:16.268
Wow.

00:22:17.295 --> 00:22:18.295
You’re so good.

00:22:19.682 --> 00:22:20.682
I know.

00:22:30.542 --> 00:22:31.542
What’s this?

00:22:31.685 --> 00:22:32.685
Testing out the water.

00:22:33.508 --> 00:22:35.895
See if I can fool around with you now.

00:22:37.602 --> 00:22:38.602
I’m not your playmate.

00:22:54.121 --> 00:22:55.121
What are you up to?

00:22:55.772 --> 00:22:58.308
Anything that can make you smile.

00:22:59.715 --> 00:23:00.715
What a hassle.

00:23:02.041 --> 00:23:03.041
Hey!

00:23:14.748 --> 00:23:15.748
I told you.

00:23:17.291 --> 00:23:18.291
It’s safe this time.

00:23:35.728 --> 00:23:36.978
His parents are all dead

00:23:37.075 --> 00:23:38.561
so I took him in.

00:23:41.555 --> 00:23:42.795
Didn’t you say you were hungry?

00:23:45.408 --> 00:23:48.611
A man should eat a lot
so he can grow up quickly.

00:23:49.298 --> 00:23:51.178
When you’re strong,
you can take care of others.

00:23:54.042 --> 00:23:55.048
Alright, big bro?

00:24:07.848 --> 00:24:08.848
Hey.

00:24:10.542 --> 00:24:12.595
Is that one of the skills
of a criminologist?

00:24:18.408 --> 00:24:19.535
It’s an orphan’s skill.

00:24:24.488 --> 00:24:25.608
I’m an orphan.

00:24:26.275 --> 00:24:30.028
Thunphob’s dad took me in

00:24:31.868 --> 00:24:33.478
so I can give my stem cell to Thunphob.

00:24:35.434 --> 00:24:36.441
Thunphob and I

00:24:38.328 --> 00:24:40.088
don’t share the same blood.

00:24:42.448 --> 00:24:43.448
But we

00:24:46.122 --> 00:24:47.615
gave each other a new life.

00:24:55.002 --> 00:24:56.075
It’s not about dad.

00:24:58.521 --> 00:24:59.558
Nothing to do with favor.

00:25:01.948 --> 00:25:02.948
I’m doing this

00:25:04.688 --> 00:25:05.688
because I want to.

00:25:08.208 --> 00:25:09.315
I want you to live.

00:25:15.015 --> 00:25:16.015
You will survive.

00:25:46.722 --> 00:25:47.722
I was lucky

00:25:48.615 --> 00:25:50.328
that my cell matches the rich.

00:25:52.028 --> 00:25:53.028
While you

00:25:54.382 --> 00:25:55.382
were unlucky

00:25:56.055 --> 00:25:57.055
to have met me.

00:26:04.162 --> 00:26:05.698
Thunphob was lucky to have you.

00:26:07.835 --> 00:26:09.515
Even though you’re not a very good guy.

00:26:10.075 --> 00:26:11.548
But you’re a good older brother.

00:26:14.202 --> 00:26:16.135
I want to be a good guy in your eyes too.

00:26:18.122 --> 00:26:20.082
Is there anything I can still do
to make it right?

00:26:21.465 --> 00:26:23.301
What does my body language tell you?

00:26:24.242 --> 00:26:25.362
I’m so scared.

00:26:27.482 --> 00:26:29.281
Scared that it’s just all in my head.

00:26:32.132 --> 00:26:33.332
What you’re thinking is right.

00:26:40.842 --> 00:26:41.842
You know what?

00:26:46.385 --> 00:26:48.915
Grandma said Thunphob
wanted to buy this for me

00:26:49.348 --> 00:26:50.748
because he thought I might like it,

00:26:55.428 --> 00:26:57.468
but even up until now,
nothing feels familiar to me.

00:27:15.022 --> 00:27:17.542
How should I listen to the leaves
for them to resemble a melody?

00:27:25.235 --> 00:27:26.915
Even the sound of
that waterfall is louder.

00:27:27.682 --> 00:27:28.682
The sound of a waterfall?

00:27:41.328 --> 00:27:42.328
You’re right.

00:27:43.342 --> 00:27:44.822
It’s really the sound of a waterfall.

00:27:57.607 --> 00:27:59.028
Now there’s only you

00:28:01.682 --> 00:28:02.741
that I’m familiar with.

00:28:20.968 --> 00:28:22.308
How is Thunphob’s case going?

00:28:23.055 --> 00:28:25.321
I’ve checked the information.
Still nothing new.

00:28:38.068 --> 00:28:39.068
(Mr. Botpleng?)

00:28:39.255 --> 00:28:40.318
(Why are you calling?)

00:28:41.248 --> 00:28:42.635
(Oh, it’s me, Inspector Dao.)

00:28:43.028 --> 00:28:46.041
Excuse me, I’m calling for Tankhun.

00:28:46.708 --> 00:28:49.671
(Tankhun got clipped by a bike in front
of the police station this morning.)

00:28:49.695 --> 00:28:51.281
(He’s at the hospital right now.)

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:53.350
Okay.

00:28:53.858 --> 00:28:54.858
Mile.

00:28:55.506 --> 00:28:56.168
What is it?

00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:57.204
I’m taking half a day off.

00:28:57.307 --> 00:28:58.226
Hey! Where are you going?

00:28:58.267 --> 00:28:59.267
I’ll be right back.

00:28:59.494 --> 00:29:00.494
Hey! Pleng!

00:29:15.723 --> 00:29:16.723
Tankhun!

00:29:19.737 --> 00:29:20.737
How are you doing?

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:23.180
Oh.

00:29:24.037 --> 00:29:25.037
I’m fine.

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:27.300
What happened?

00:29:27.853 --> 00:29:28.893
Nothing much.

00:29:29.232 --> 00:29:30.701
I meant to meet Inspector Dao

00:29:30.747 --> 00:29:32.715
to discuss the case
at the police station this morning.

00:29:32.739 --> 00:29:33.739
I didn’t watch out.

00:29:33.859 --> 00:29:35.954
I was careless and the bike just–

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.120
Hello?

00:29:46.805 --> 00:29:47.407
Yeah.

00:29:47.551 --> 00:29:48.551
I’m here.

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:52.140
The parking lot on the side is full
so I’m parking at the back instead.

00:29:54.788 --> 00:29:55.788
Ow!

00:29:56.517 --> 00:29:57.517
Ow!

00:30:03.995 --> 00:30:04.995
It wasn’t an accident.

00:30:08.109 --> 00:30:09.109
What did you say?

00:30:10.584 --> 00:30:12.825
Oh, nothing.

00:30:13.441 --> 00:30:14.441
I’m alright.

00:30:14.718 --> 00:30:16.118
The doctor said I can just go home.

00:30:20.629 --> 00:30:21.145
Ow!

00:30:21.197 --> 00:30:22.209
- Let me help you.
- Ow!

00:30:22.233 --> 00:30:23.233
Sorry!

00:30:25.215 --> 00:30:26.215
Does it hurt a lot?

00:30:45.251 --> 00:30:46.251
Sit here.

00:30:47.541 --> 00:30:48.541
Thank you.

00:31:07.861 --> 00:31:08.861
Give it.

00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:12.424
Put that down slowly.

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.708
From now on, for the things you can’t do,

00:31:18.011 --> 00:31:19.011
I’ll do it for you.

00:31:25.373 --> 00:31:26.373
Everything?

00:32:22.493 --> 00:32:23.493
Sorry.

00:32:24.127 --> 00:32:26.087
I reckon there’s only egg and water
in the fridge.

00:32:27.496 --> 00:32:29.496
Let me know what you want
to eat for the next meal.

00:32:29.859 --> 00:32:31.099
I’ll have it delivered for you.

00:32:31.451 --> 00:32:32.451
No.

00:32:33.939 --> 00:32:35.240
I want to eat the food you make.

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:42.750
I’ll feed you.

00:32:49.461 --> 00:32:50.566
I don’t know if it’s good.

00:32:59.861 --> 00:33:00.489
Hmm!

00:33:00.756 --> 00:33:01.756
It’s really good!

00:33:03.689 --> 00:33:04.772
Let’s see.

00:33:19.908 --> 00:33:20.908
Do you want some more?

00:33:41.037 --> 00:33:41.954
Hey! Tankhun!

00:33:42.037 --> 00:33:43.253
Ow!

00:33:43.335 --> 00:33:45.295
Why didn’t you tell me
you want to use the toilet?

00:33:47.434 --> 00:33:49.434
I don’t think you have to
take care of me for this.

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.117
The floor could be slippery.

00:33:52.718 --> 00:33:54.323
What if you slip and hit your head?

00:33:56.645 --> 00:33:57.645
Okay.

00:33:58.548 --> 00:33:59.548
Uh…

00:34:01.747 --> 00:34:03.613
And are you going to…

00:34:10.410 --> 00:34:11.410
I know that!

00:34:12.253 --> 00:34:13.253
I’ll wait outside.

00:35:02.696 --> 00:35:05.197
Stop exploiting my memory with Thunphob.

00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:06.940
I never said

00:35:07.378 --> 00:35:09.010
that this is Thunphob’s memory.

00:35:11.565 --> 00:35:12.565
What are you up to?

00:35:12.893 --> 00:35:13.893
Anything

00:35:14.347 --> 00:35:15.667
as long as it can make you smile.

00:35:28.815 --> 00:35:29.815
What is it, Mile?

00:35:33.897 --> 00:35:34.897
He lied to you.

00:35:35.364 --> 00:35:36.924
Why do you still get involved with him?

00:35:37.895 --> 00:35:39.327
Who exactly is lying to me, Mile?

00:35:42.104 --> 00:35:43.193
How did you know

00:35:43.963 --> 00:35:45.371
that this place is Tankhun’s house?

00:35:47.015 --> 00:35:48.043
And why are you here now?

00:35:54.274 --> 00:35:55.763
The one who seems least suspicious

00:35:56.626 --> 00:35:57.817
tends to be hiding something.

00:36:00.965 --> 00:36:02.272
So can you tell me now?

00:36:02.913 --> 00:36:04.824
How did you know
that this is Tankhun’s house?

00:36:07.094 --> 00:36:08.821
You don’t have to know
how I figured it out.

00:36:10.361 --> 00:36:11.641
Everything I did

00:36:12.759 --> 00:36:13.919
was because I care about you.

00:36:15.474 --> 00:36:17.022
You’d better tell the truth, Mile.

00:36:18.157 --> 00:36:20.138
You’re the only one who knows I’d be here.

00:36:20.646 --> 00:36:22.304
- You meant to–
- I just love you.

00:36:23.964 --> 00:36:24.964
I just love you.

00:36:25.518 --> 00:36:26.599
Is that wrong?

00:36:39.297 --> 00:36:40.844
Don’t you ever think that by saying that,

00:36:40.868 --> 00:36:42.314
I would stop suspecting you.

00:36:46.361 --> 00:36:47.841
Or is the reason you’re suspecting me

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:51.280
is just because you didn’t want to
believe in what I say?

00:36:51.761 --> 00:36:52.761
That I love you?

00:36:56.074 --> 00:36:57.313
All I did was because

00:36:58.475 --> 00:36:59.824
I’m worried about you, Pleng.

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:09.310
Listen to me.

00:37:11.337 --> 00:37:13.414
I’m okay with having you in my life.

00:37:17.073 --> 00:37:18.485
But as a friend.

00:37:24.001 --> 00:37:25.395
Do you really think that way?

00:37:33.968 --> 00:37:35.648
You’re my best friend.

00:37:37.224 --> 00:37:38.512
And that will never change.

00:37:42.728 --> 00:37:43.750
Thank you so much.

00:37:52.776 --> 00:37:53.776
You’re–

00:37:54.225 --> 00:37:55.225
So mean.

00:38:00.154 --> 00:38:01.154
I’m so–

00:38:01.868 --> 00:38:02.960
I shouldn’t have said that.

00:38:06.141 --> 00:38:07.141
Why?

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:08.760
Are you shy?

00:38:12.078 --> 00:38:13.078
Stop it.

00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:18.210
Fine.

00:38:18.638 --> 00:38:19.998
It’s good that you’re smiling now.

00:38:20.164 --> 00:38:21.198
But don’t forget.

00:38:21.713 --> 00:38:23.905
You’re still on my list of suspects.

00:38:26.192 --> 00:38:27.192
Fine.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.360
He didn’t lie.

00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:57.540
You saw?

00:38:59.398 --> 00:39:00.398
I heard the noise.

00:39:01.718 --> 00:39:02.718
So I went out to see.

00:39:10.454 --> 00:39:11.815
He seemed open.

00:39:13.995 --> 00:39:15.096
He says what he thinks.

00:39:15.857 --> 00:39:16.857
He wasn’t lying.

00:39:18.411 --> 00:39:19.456
If he were a liar,

00:39:21.062 --> 00:39:22.582
he would have been a really good liar.

00:39:26.481 --> 00:39:27.481
But…

00:39:28.418 --> 00:39:29.921
You told me to watch out.

00:39:33.235 --> 00:39:34.715
If it was because he liked you

00:39:36.875 --> 00:39:37.988
then that was reasonable.

00:39:42.919 --> 00:39:44.226
That’s even worse.

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:46.936
You didn’t like Muenmile?

00:39:49.864 --> 00:39:51.007
You have the guts to ask?

00:39:53.054 --> 00:39:54.412
How many times have we kissed?

00:39:55.248 --> 00:39:56.968
Aren’t you too attached
to your first love?

00:39:59.293 --> 00:40:00.414
Thunphob’s already dead.

00:40:00.564 --> 00:40:01.822
How do you want me to put this?

00:40:10.051 --> 00:40:11.051
What I did

00:40:14.152 --> 00:40:15.152
was disgusting.

00:40:40.237 --> 00:40:41.237
If it’s disgusting,

00:40:44.462 --> 00:40:45.952
then both of us are disgusting.

00:41:17.453 --> 00:41:19.293
What if I were the one
who killed your brother?

00:41:20.364 --> 00:41:21.422
What would you do?

00:41:22.133 --> 00:41:23.710
I would hold you like this.

00:41:24.802 --> 00:41:27.410
If it hurts so much
that you have to forget,

00:41:28.153 --> 00:41:29.153
Then I…

00:41:29.976 --> 00:41:31.231
don’t want you to remember.

00:41:32.167 --> 00:41:33.380
That’s what I fear.

00:41:34.606 --> 00:41:36.145
I fear that it’d be worse.

00:41:39.545 --> 00:41:40.545
Why are you following me?

00:41:42.386 --> 00:41:44.811
I won’t let Botpleng get in danger.

00:41:46.017 --> 00:41:47.017
It felt like

00:41:47.284 --> 00:41:48.770
it wasn’t the first time I saw him.

00:41:49.975 --> 00:41:51.216
You’ve met Tanu before?

00:41:51.772 --> 00:41:53.806
Madame, do you know Thunphob?

00:41:53.944 --> 00:41:57.011
It’s not my obligation
to answer this question.

00:41:57.642 --> 00:41:59.309
You really knew my lover, Grandma.

00:42:00.371 --> 00:42:01.371
Mom!

00:42:01.448 --> 00:42:04.968
It seems like Mr. Pleng’s memories
are about to return.

00:42:05.377 --> 00:42:06.377
Pleng!

00:42:06.926 --> 00:42:07.664
Who?

00:42:07.859 --> 00:42:09.861
If they want your memory to return,

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:12.290
why did they prevent you
from thinking about the past?

00:42:12.778 --> 00:42:14.417
What if it’s not to make him remember

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:16.980
but to make him forget
about a certain event?
