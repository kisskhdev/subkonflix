WEBVTT

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:36.280
Little Boss

00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:37.920
We're in your territory now.

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:40.359
Don't run off again.

00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:41.359
Do you hear me?

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.640
Go to your dad.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.560
Go back now.

00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:57.040
Assemble the troops. Prepare for battle.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.640
Yes, sir.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.640
What is it now?

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.439
This battle is unavoidable.

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.400
Wasn't everything settled?

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:05.480
If we don't have to fight, let's not fight.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.920
As a commander,

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.480
leading subordinates onto the battlefield,

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.840
how can one leave the outcome to chance?

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.920
You helped me save my son,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.120
and secured my territory.

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.560
But Division Commander Chen won't let this go.

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:16.639
Trust me.

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:17.520
Division Commander Chen

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:19.280
is also ready.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.439
Commander Liao's position is on low ground.

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:23.199
Fan's troops are likely here.

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:25.159
You circle around from across the river.

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:26.560
I'll flank from this side.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.120
We'll form a pincer movement.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.479
There shouldn't be a problem.

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:31.080
Don't worry.

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:32.560
The things I promised you,

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.919
you won't be shorted a single one.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.159
You can rest assured too.

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:38.560
My army will give its all.

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:43.680
You lot,

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:45.400
go prepare as well.

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:46.680
Yes, sir.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.879
Commander.

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.439
Then what do I need to do?

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.960
You don't need to be involved.

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.800
I'll listen to your arrangements, Commander.

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:03.400
Then I'll stay at base camp,

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.960
prepare good wine and meat,

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:06.560
and await your triumphant return.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.240
From now on,

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.719
you don't need to be involved in anything.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.120
Commander, Commander.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.599
Did I do something wrong?

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.520
Although today,

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.000
Silly Fan ruined my plans,

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:26.240
I still admire him.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.360
He has courage and strategy.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.840
He values loyalty and righteousness.

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:32.759
He is what a soldier should be.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.719
But you?

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.759
You've read so many books in vain.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.680
You're full of wicked schemes.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.400
Above, you do not respect heaven and earth.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.759
Below, you have no pity for the people.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.680
No fear in your heart, no restraint in your words or deeds.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.080
You don't deserve to wear this uniform.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.479
Men!

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:50.319
Here!

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.520
Drag him out.

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:53.159
Strip him of his uniform.

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:55.400
Commander! Commander! Commander!

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:56.719
I can change!

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.039
Whatever the problem is, I can change!

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.840
Change?

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:01.319
If I keep you around,

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:03.199
I'll be the laughingstock of others.

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:05.280
From now on,

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.800
you're on your own.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.599
Take him out.

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:09.080
Move!

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.000
Commander, I was wrong! Commander!

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.599
Move!

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:11.759
Commander, give me one more chance!

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.120
Commander! Commander! Commander!

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:31.720
Fine.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.959
Fine.

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:35.600
This isn't over.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.120
This isn't over.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.360
Commander Liao

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:51.920
Congratulations, congratulations

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.040
You tricked me, saying you'd find the Lucky General

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:57.720
You disappeared for so long

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.480
Where is the Lucky General?

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:59.879
This is him

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.720
Division Commander

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:07.319
I came specifically to ask for...

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:08.800
...that reward of one hundred silver dollars

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.920
How many times are you going to sell me?

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.160
Whose side are you on, you bastard?

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:15.680
I'm on your side

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.920
Commander, you and our Brigade Commander...

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.959
...are truly destined to meet by fate

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.279
Reward him

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.519
Thank you, Commander

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:25.399
Brigade Commander

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.120
I've brought the troops outside

00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:28.720
Just give the order...

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:30.759
...and we'll immediately submit to Commander Liao

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.279
Who said I was going to submit?

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.279
I'm leaving

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.120
Where are you going?

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:41.639
Where *can* you go?

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.079
Chen and Wei already view you as a rebel army

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:46.000
They won't let you off

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.480
With your current military strength...

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:48.879
...you definitely can't beat them

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.959
Why not stay and fight with me?

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:52.759
Thank you for thinking highly of me, Commander Liao

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.839
I don't want to fight anymore

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.120
The guts of you Division Commanders...

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.439
...are really twisted

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:00.800
Calculating back and forth all day long

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.480
I can't out-calculate you

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
My goal this time was just to save my little brother

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.600
Now that I've handed him over to you...

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:10.759
...my mission is complete

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:11.879
Are you really leaving?

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:13.279
Think it over carefully

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:18.279
I've thought it over

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:21.240
Good

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.800
Everyone has their own aspirations

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.680
Since you've already decided...

00:06:27.079 --> 00:06:27.959
...I won't force you

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.639
Thank you for your help this time

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:31.639
I believe...

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.680
...we will meet again very soon

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.439
Farewell

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:40.120
Stop

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.079
Where are you going?

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.560
I'm following Big Brother Fan

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.439
To save you this time...

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.439
...I almost sacrificed many lives

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.759
If you keep messing around like this...

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:52.519
...you'll get your Big Brother Fan killed too

00:06:52.519 --> 00:06:53.680
You didn't save me

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:55.240
Big Brother Fan saved me

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.319
This is the last time I'm saving you

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.959
There won't be a next time

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:01.079
Think about it

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:06.240
Little Boss

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:07.720
Go back

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.439
You must remember...

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.600
...I will always be your big brother

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:20.199
On this matter...

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.839
...you must listen to our Old man

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.399
Take care

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.319
Where are we heading?

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:43.279
First, let's leave this place of trouble

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:45.040
Brigade Commander, have you considered...

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.079
...that Commander Liao is actually...

00:07:47.079 --> 00:07:48.720
...someone worth following?

00:07:50.079 --> 00:07:52.319
I also feel we're birds of a feather

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.759
I've followed two Division Commanders already

00:07:56.199 --> 00:07:57.600
And I've learned quite a bit

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.040
We can strike out on our own...

00:07:59.439 --> 00:08:01.120
...and give it a try ourselves

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:03.199
I didn't expect you to have such ambition

00:08:03.839 --> 00:08:05.800
You all say I'm a Lucky General

00:08:06.439 --> 00:08:09.319
This time, I'll be a Lucky General for myself

00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:22.399
Damn it!

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:23.839
Call out to them!

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.439
Damn it!

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.399
Commander Wei

00:08:31.439 --> 00:08:33.560
We're not here to fight

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:38.120
We're going back home

00:08:58.799 --> 00:08:59.720
What's going on?

00:09:03.399 --> 00:09:04.159
Brigade Commander Fan

00:09:05.759 --> 00:09:06.639
What are you doing here?

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.759
Our Commander said...

00:09:07.759 --> 00:09:08.919
...we would meet again very soon

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.960
It happened too fast

00:09:12.039 --> 00:09:13.559
He wants me to thank you properly

00:09:14.279 --> 00:09:15.919
Then we have no choice but to fight

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.960
Fine, let's fight together

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.000
Alright

00:09:33.159 --> 00:09:33.879
Here.

00:09:34.919 --> 00:09:37.159
Have some figs from my hometown, Weiyuan.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.960
Here, share them among the brothers.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.159
Here, Number Two.

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:46.120
Number Four.

00:09:48.039 --> 00:09:49.159
This Division Commander Chen...

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.960
stays holed up in the city all day.

00:09:51.639 --> 00:09:53.240
Commander Wei fires two shots today,

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.159
and fires two shells tomorrow.

00:09:54.159 --> 00:09:55.080
It's been so long.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.000
Brother, when will this battle end?

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.639
I've been sick of fighting for a long time.

00:09:58.879 --> 00:10:00.200
Then what are we doing here?

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.639
Then let's inspect...

00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:06.720
how you guys have been fighting lately,

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.320
see if there's any improvement.

00:10:09.639 --> 00:10:10.399
In war,

00:10:11.399 --> 00:10:12.440
you can't be afraid of death.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.320
If a bullet is meant to hit you,

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.960
it'll hit you even if you burrow underground.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.840
If a bullet isn't meant to hit you,

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.240
even if you stand here like a telephone pole,

00:10:22.799 --> 00:10:23.879
it won't hit you.

00:10:24.639 --> 00:10:25.440
Do you understand?

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.240
And then there's the machine gun.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.440
What should you do?

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.480
Get down!

00:10:33.559 --> 00:10:34.360
Idiots.

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:38.039
That's a machine gun spraying aimlessly.

00:10:38.399 --> 00:10:39.559
You should run.

00:10:40.879 --> 00:10:42.039
But if the machine gun...

00:10:44.399 --> 00:10:45.240
what should you do?

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.159
We run!

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.039
Idiots.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.720
That's a machine gun firing aimed shots.

00:10:51.159 --> 00:10:52.559
You should get down.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.279
And another thing.

00:10:56.279 --> 00:10:58.240
Why are you in the trenches,

00:10:58.519 --> 00:11:00.360
while I stay in a shell crater?

00:11:00.879 --> 00:11:01.639
Why?

00:11:01.919 --> 00:11:02.559
Because...

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.799
Because... no second shell...

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.159
ever lands in the same crater.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.320
For example, this shell...

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:13.600
Run!

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.639
Run!

00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:20.919
Are you okay?

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.480
Is everyone okay?

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:24.919
Brother, are you okay?

00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:26.360
Brigade Commander Fan,

00:11:26.799 --> 00:11:28.159
didn't you say a second shell...

00:11:28.159 --> 00:11:30.279
wouldn't land in the same crater?

00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:33.200
This...

00:11:34.639 --> 00:11:37.000
is the second lesson I'm teaching you.

00:11:37.759 --> 00:11:39.679
Nothing in this world is absolute.

00:11:40.799 --> 00:11:44.120
Food's here! Food's here!

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.399
What are we eating?

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.799
Yuxiang shredded pork, stir-fried liver,

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:51.480
and steamed pork belly.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.600
And your favorite, twice-cooked pork.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:03.559
Brigade Commander Fan!

00:12:03.559 --> 00:12:05.799
The twice-cooked pork... is it still there?

00:12:06.159 --> 00:12:06.840
Twice-cooked pork...

00:12:14.799 --> 00:12:16.240
Screw the food.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.919
Beiping and Tianjin have been occupied.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.120
Songhu is also in a stalemate.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.519
Fighting has started in Taiyuan too.

00:13:00.039 --> 00:13:01.480
The main Nationalist forces have been deployed.

00:13:01.759 --> 00:13:02.759
It's a struggle.

00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:09.759
Constant bombing, the people are suffering.

00:13:11.799 --> 00:13:13.360
Times are hard.

00:13:15.559 --> 00:13:17.480
I also want to ignore what's happening outside.

00:13:17.879 --> 00:13:19.200
But speaking from my conscience,

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.639
I can't do it.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.399
I just don't know if General Liu can stay out of it.

00:13:24.679 --> 00:13:28.879
When the nest falls, no egg is safe.

00:13:31.679 --> 00:13:32.679
Let me ask you something.

00:13:33.639 --> 00:13:36.039
If the two of us rashly send troops,

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.720
would it be against the rules?

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.639
Doing as we please,

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.159
acting first and reporting later...

00:13:47.279 --> 00:13:49.679
haven't we done enough of that?

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.240
Exactly.

00:13:51.919 --> 00:13:53.360
I've lost my patience long ago.

00:13:53.559 --> 00:13:55.279
I was just waiting for you to say that.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:57.639
Let me tell you,

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.320
under our command,

00:13:59.519 --> 00:14:00.879
those few mischievous brats...

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.679
normally,

00:14:02.679 --> 00:14:05.039
we'd let their petty squabbles slide.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:05.559
Yes.

00:14:05.759 --> 00:14:07.600
But today is different from the past.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.679
We might still...

00:14:09.679 --> 00:14:11.360
need to go straighten them out.

00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:12.200
It's very necessary.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.840
What the hell are we fighting for?

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:18.960
Well said.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.519
Our compatriots

00:15:22.039 --> 00:15:24.240
are in deep suffering.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.559
Following the Northeast,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.080
now it is North China.

00:15:29.519 --> 00:15:31.279
The Japanese imperialist bandits

00:15:31.559 --> 00:15:33.120
intend to turn the Chinese people

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.960
into a nation of slaves.

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:37.600
Facing a formidable enemy,

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.159
we can no longer fight amongst ourselves.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.000
We must all unite

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.399
and face the external enemy together.

00:15:44.799 --> 00:15:46.120
Save our compatriots,

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.720
defend our homeland,

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.799
and drive the Japanese aggressors

00:15:49.799 --> 00:15:51.559
out of Chinese territory.

00:15:52.279 --> 00:15:53.799
I answer the call.

00:15:55.159 --> 00:15:56.399
Here we are,

00:15:56.799 --> 00:15:58.600
fighting back and forth,

00:15:59.399 --> 00:16:01.960
just to seize a town or occupy a village.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.879
The Japanese

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.759
want to destroy our nation.

00:16:07.679 --> 00:16:08.720
I answer the call.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.159
The Japanese aggressors are bastards.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.600
If one comes, I'll shoot one.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.399
If two come, I'll cut down a pair.

00:16:18.919 --> 00:16:19.759
Division Commander Chen,

00:16:20.679 --> 00:16:21.960
in the face of national righteousness,

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:24.120
we must put aside our grievances.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.240
Commander Liao,

00:16:26.679 --> 00:16:28.240
you just focus on winning battles.

00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:31.159
When you return from driving out the Japanese aggressors,

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.879
our score

00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:35.159
can be settled then.

00:16:35.919 --> 00:16:36.440
Good.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.159
Well said.

00:16:39.399 --> 00:16:40.759
From now on,

00:16:41.559 --> 00:16:43.159
we Sons of Sichuan

00:16:43.519 --> 00:16:46.440
united as one, forging the Sichuan Army together.

00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:48.279
United against the enemy,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.360
ready at any moment

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.679
to march out for the country.

00:16:53.279 --> 00:16:54.639
Kill!

00:16:54.919 --> 00:17:00.919
Kill! Kill! Kill!

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:01.879
Now,

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.320
the special envoy from headquarters will announce orders.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.039
By order of General Liu:

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:11.640
Fan's unit is united, righteous, brave, and decisive,

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:13.039
and highly praised.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:17.240
Fan's unit is hereby incorporated into the 36th Brigade,

00:17:17.759 --> 00:17:20.559
and the 36th Brigade is expanded into

00:17:20.799 --> 00:17:22.960
the 3rd Division of the 21st Army.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:27.200
Fan Pengju is appointed Major General, Division Commander.

00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:39.200
Attention!

00:17:43.039 --> 00:17:44.759
Come, let me toast everyone.

00:17:45.079 --> 00:17:47.440
Congratulations to Big Brother and Scar on becoming Regimental Commanders.

00:17:48.039 --> 00:17:49.960
Congratulations to Laoyao on becoming Battalion Commander.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.759
Congratulations to Lao Er, Lao San, and Lao Si

00:17:51.759 --> 00:17:52.920
On becoming Platoon Leaders.

00:17:53.039 --> 00:17:54.279
Come, come, come.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.160
Drink up! Cheers!

00:17:56.839 --> 00:17:58.160
I want to join your troops.

00:17:58.599 --> 00:17:59.839
And go with you.

00:18:01.279 --> 00:18:03.160
We are going to fight the Japanese bandits.

00:18:03.559 --> 00:18:06.240
Bullets don't have eyes on the battlefield.

00:18:07.079 --> 00:18:08.400
I am also a Son of Sichuan.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.200
You are all going to fight.

00:18:10.759 --> 00:18:12.359
I can't be a coward hiding in his shell.

00:18:12.599 --> 00:18:13.720
I am a Descendant of generals.

00:18:14.119 --> 00:18:15.400
I should set an example even more.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:18.920
I don't care.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.599
I'm going with you no matter what.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.160
You want to go?

00:18:22.599 --> 00:18:24.519
Then you should go with your Old man.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:25.759
He can't control me.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.839
I'm not important to him anyway.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.039
What do you mean not important?

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.839
Didn't he save you in the end?

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.759
One moment he saves me, the next he doesn't.

00:18:33.039 --> 00:18:34.440
He might as well not save me at all.

00:18:35.039 --> 00:18:37.200
It's made my feelings very complicated.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.359
As a Division Commander...

00:18:43.359 --> 00:18:46.880
He has so many soldiers who need to follow and respect him.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.759
Sometimes he has no choice.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.720
You have to understand.

00:18:54.359 --> 00:18:57.160
You'll understand once you're on the battlefield.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.640
So you agree to let me go with you?

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.680
The nation is in crisis.

00:19:02.319 --> 00:19:05.400
We men should have some guts.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.319
But I have three conditions for you.

00:19:08.839 --> 00:19:09.680
First.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.039
No unauthorized actions.

00:19:12.319 --> 00:19:13.079
Second.

00:19:13.279 --> 00:19:15.240
Do not leave my sight on the battlefield.

00:19:15.359 --> 00:19:16.200
Third.

00:19:17.359 --> 00:19:19.359
Go back and make up with your Old man.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.240
I agree to the first two right now.

00:19:23.759 --> 00:19:24.960
As for the last one...

00:19:25.759 --> 00:19:27.200
Let me think about it first.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:28.680
Alright.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.680
Before we set out...

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.240
Think it over.

00:19:33.599 --> 00:19:34.880
Yes sir, Division Commander!

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:39.559
Brothers!

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.279
Our ambition...

00:19:41.279 --> 00:19:44.079
Has always been to roam the world and uphold justice.

00:19:44.799 --> 00:19:45.759
From now on...

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.279
I'm going to show what I'm truly capable of.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.480
Brothers...

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.960
We don't ask to be born on the same day...

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.599
But we ask to die on the same day.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.200
Us lot...

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.759
If we end up dying on the battlefield...

00:20:00.039 --> 00:20:01.319
Then we are true brothers.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.880
Don't jinx it!

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:04.960
We haven't even left and you're talking about death.

00:20:05.119 --> 00:20:06.279
Why can't we...

00:20:06.279 --> 00:20:07.400
All come back alive?

00:20:09.599 --> 00:20:10.519
Exactly.

00:20:11.119 --> 00:20:12.559
I haven't even taken a wife yet.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.240
When I get back...

00:20:14.559 --> 00:20:16.319
I'm definitely going to sleep with a woman in my arms.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.240
I think...

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.640
As long as us brothers are together...

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:20.680
I'm not afraid.

00:20:20.799 --> 00:20:21.559
Worst case scenario...

00:20:21.559 --> 00:20:23.279
In the next life, I'll still be a hero.

00:20:24.799 --> 00:20:27.000
Anyway, following Division Commander Fan...

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.440
We're real men.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:29.920
Rise up!

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:30.839
Come, come.

00:20:30.839 --> 00:20:32.440
A toast to Big Brother.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:33.839
Cheers!

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.079
Cheers!

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.400
Pockmarked Tiger.

00:20:49.559 --> 00:20:51.079
I haven't come to see you in a long time.

00:20:52.079 --> 00:20:53.160
Did you miss me?

00:20:54.839 --> 00:20:55.880
I missed you.

00:21:03.039 --> 00:21:04.599
Those Japanese aggressors...

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.880
Are even worse than that guy named Wei.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.319
I'm going to go deal with them.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.039
Once I've dealt with them...

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.240
I'll come back to keep you company.

00:21:15.279 --> 00:21:16.839
I'll still be your loyal servant.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.279
If I don't come back...

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.359
One, two, one!

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:02.880
One, two, one!

00:22:03.079 --> 00:22:05.839
One, two, one, halt!

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.799
Turn left and right!

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.839
The Young Master is back! The Young Master is back!

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:13.640
Young Master, let me.

00:22:13.759 --> 00:22:14.640
I'll do it myself.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:15.960
Close the door.

00:22:36.599 --> 00:22:37.480
Old Master

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.480
The Young Master is back

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.720
Please open the door and take a look

00:22:43.599 --> 00:22:45.880
Old Master, come out and take a look

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:46.880
I won't shout anymore

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.079
I'm not back to stay

00:23:33.119 --> 00:23:35.880
I came back this time mainly to say goodbye to you...

00:23:36.039 --> 00:23:37.720
...and to the ancestors

00:23:38.799 --> 00:23:41.319
Once I leave, I don't know...

00:24:14.559 --> 00:24:16.440
You were right to make me study

00:24:18.039 --> 00:24:20.759
You were right to spank me too

00:24:21.759 --> 00:24:23.039
Even burying me alive...

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.680
...was all correct

00:24:27.079 --> 00:24:28.400
Only now do I realize...

00:24:29.119 --> 00:24:30.440
...you did it all for my own good

00:24:33.759 --> 00:24:36.160
The lampwick cakes you love...

00:24:37.599 --> 00:24:38.799
I promised...

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:40.920
...that as soon as I had money...

00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:42.920
...I'd buy you enough to eat your fill

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.240
The leaf tobacco you love to smoke...

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.519
...I've brought it back for you this time

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.039
Top-quality Shifang tobacco

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.039
Fan Pengju has been unfilial

00:25:05.079 --> 00:25:06.000
Just now...

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.400
...I asked the ancestors to bless Granduncle

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.440
To wait safe and sound for my return

00:25:14.319 --> 00:25:15.960
I also prayed for Yu Zhen

00:25:16.799 --> 00:25:18.359
I've been looking for her all this time

00:25:19.559 --> 00:25:22.319
There's no time to find her now

00:25:25.079 --> 00:25:26.279
Counting the time...

00:25:28.039 --> 00:25:29.359
...my child...

00:25:33.599 --> 00:25:34.960
...should be one year old

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.519
I haven't even given him a name yet

00:25:40.039 --> 00:25:41.559
I must trouble you, Granduncle...

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.079
...to help your great-grandson...

00:25:44.519 --> 00:25:47.160
...choose a resounding name

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.759
Raise him to become...

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.279
...the kind of person you hope for

00:26:00.119 --> 00:26:01.480
I'm leaving

00:26:36.119 --> 00:26:37.079
Your old man...

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.519
...is off to do great things

00:26:40.599 --> 00:26:42.039
Let him leave with some swagger

00:26:43.799 --> 00:26:45.240
Don't let him be weighed down by worry

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.640
I entrust my son to you

00:27:26.079 --> 00:27:27.039
Young Master

00:27:27.759 --> 00:27:28.640
Young Master

00:27:29.079 --> 00:27:29.920
What are you doing here?

00:27:30.039 --> 00:27:31.640
The Old Master told me to go with you...

00:27:31.759 --> 00:27:32.759
...to take care of you

00:27:33.359 --> 00:27:34.400
Get in line at the back

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:50.720
The vast rivers and mountains are now shattered

00:27:51.559 --> 00:27:55.400
The iron hooves of the Japanese bandits ring out

00:27:56.039 --> 00:27:59.240
Sacrificing oneself for loyalty is like filial piety

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:02.799
Fighting bravely on the battlefield makes a national hero

00:28:03.279 --> 00:28:07.759
In this national crisis, we leave Sichuan to fight

00:28:08.319 --> 00:28:12.599
If we win, we return in triumph

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:18.000
If we do not win, we return wrapped in shrouds

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:23.160
We fight for our fathers, brothers, wives, and children

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:29.480
No return to Sichuan without victory!

00:28:29.759 --> 00:28:39.599
No return to Sichuan without victory!

00:29:15.519 --> 00:29:19.799
Sichuan will not fail the nation!

00:29:20.039 --> 00:29:57.519
Sichuan will not fail the nation!

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:54.839
Men at their birth are naturally good

00:30:56.119 --> 00:31:03.240
Their natures are similar, their habits become different

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.440
Baby...

00:31:06.279 --> 00:31:08.839
Don't be as silly as your old man
