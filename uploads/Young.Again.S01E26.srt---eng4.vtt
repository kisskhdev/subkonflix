00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.459
Hello

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.319
Hello

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:09.599
What is it?

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.979
Hello

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:12.240
It's still early

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:14.080
I'm looking for someone

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:15.120
Looking for a door?

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.240
Me

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:17.919
Bye-bye

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.319
Bye-bye now

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.979
Take care, I won't see you out

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:22.439
Hello

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:23.219
Hello

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:26.080
Can't speak Chinese?

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.199
Speak Eng-a-lish?

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.819
No

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.280
I am German

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.060
Ger-man-ish?

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.900
Yes

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.180
You came here

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:34.740
To find someone, right?

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:35.460
Yes

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:36.080
Yes

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.680
You are a German

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.759
And you know a little bit of Chinese

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.039
You don't speak it very fluently, right?

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.500
Yes

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.300
In Germany

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.120
I studied Chinese in Germany

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.400
But I have to speak very slowly

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.939
Very slowly

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.060
Speak slowly

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:52.280
Understood

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.620
A German stutterer

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:56.139
What is your name?

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.060
Hans Himmelkraut

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:00.039
Good heavens, who can remember a name that long?

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:02.400
You can call me Hans

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.360
Parched

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.699
That's easy to remember

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.400
The parched die parched, the drowned die drowned

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.719
Just like young people dating

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:09.020
Young man, do you have a partner?

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.060
Grandma

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.080
I didn't come here to find a partner

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:14.860
I came here to find my uncle

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.159
Let me guess

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:18.400
Your uncle must be called

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:19.840
Rudy, right?

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.539
Rudy. Do you play poker in Germany too?

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.240
We do

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.620
Do you play Fight the Landlord?

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:25.599
No

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.780
Do you draw little turtles on faces?

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.860
No

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.520
Old K

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:31.139
Then why, as soon as you get to China

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.740
Do you play Fight the Landlord and draw little turtles?

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:34.539
I don't want to

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.639
I think this method is good

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:38.099
I am just...

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:41.379
When Rome in do

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:43.219
When in Rome, do as the Romans do

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:44.419
When in Rome, do as the Romans do

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.960
We call this an international retirement community

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.319
With just one foreign old man holding it up

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:52.419
If he isn't your uncle, who is?

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:53.659
Come, I'll take you to find him

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.139
Thank you.

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:57.780
Xiao Cai, morning.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.699
This is...

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:01.259
This is our German nephew.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:02.259
His name is...

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:03.020
Drowned.

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:05.120
Dried up.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.219
Withered.

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:08.740
My name is Hans.

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:09.759
Hello. Right.

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.719
Parched.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.319
The parched die parched, the drowned die drowned.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.540
What a disgrace.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.500
Moving in here at such a young age.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.259
You must not follow his example.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.240
Don't follow his example.

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:34.300
We won't.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.660
Okay, we won't.

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:36.620
Follow who?

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:37.420
I don't know.

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:40.600
Rudy.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.899
Rudy, you have a guest.

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:43.259
Look who it is.

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.600
Uncle Rudy.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.740
Hello Hans, I missed you so much.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.660
Starting with the hometown dialect.

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:52.339
Who is this?

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.279
Old Lu's real nephew.

00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:55.660
You can tell they're related at a glance.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.680
Otherwise, with that face full of turtles...

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.079
...he couldn't have recognized him instantly.

00:04:58.579 --> 00:05:00.360
What are you playing?

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.220
I like the... on your face.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.740
...tattoos.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.759
It reminds me of...

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:07.920
Romeo and Juliet.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.399
Romeo and Juliet should have tattoos too.

00:05:10.579 --> 00:05:12.620
Because they belong to different families.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.139
Pause.

00:05:14.519 --> 00:05:15.980
We can't understand what you two are saying.

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:17.500
Translate for us.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.240
Let's go through this.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.819
Okay.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.779
This is my nephew, Hans.

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:21.439
We know.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.459
He came to China from Germany.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.199
To observe some...

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:26.720
...theatre festival.

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:27.759
And he saw...

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.759
...on our faces...

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:29.879
...those tattoos...

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:30.920
...and he got an idea.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.100
To stage a...

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:33.519
...tattoo version of...

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.259
Romeo and Juliet.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.920
First time I've heard...

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.420
...someone call the little turtles drawn on our faces "tattoos."

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.579
I came to China to attend...

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.620
...the Aranya Theatre Festival.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:46.939
What theatre festival?

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:48.459
Aranya.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.300
We know "Near where?"

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.500
That's what we're asking you.

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:53.000
Aranya.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.139
Where exactly is it near?

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:54.939
Aranya.

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:56.019
This kid is driving me crazy.

00:05:56.019 --> 00:05:57.240
Near where?

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.819
Xiao Cai

00:05:57.819 --> 00:05:58.560
Stop interrupting

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.600
I understand now

00:05:59.899 --> 00:06:01.560
Our German nephew here

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.540
wants to go to Aranya

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:04.579
to attend the Theatre Festival

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.160
What I didn't quite catch is

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:09.899
are you just going to watch plays

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:12.160
or do you want to direct a play yourself

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.040
and take it to the festival to compete

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:15.139
Originally I

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:17.160
wanted to prepare a show

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.160
to participate in the Aranya Theatre Festival

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:20.959
But Aranya

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:22.620
it requires something completely

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.939
brand new

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.500
Something brand new

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:26.759
Well

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:27.959
since you're competing in China

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:30.100
there must be Chinese elements

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.699
to make it original

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.839
I think the Professor's suggestion

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:34.759
is actually quite good

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:36.000
For example

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.040
take the story of Romeo and Juliet

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.279
and place it in our Song Dynasty China

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:40.779
Let the two of them

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:42.220
live on the same street

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.879
break through the shackles of convention

00:06:45.019 --> 00:06:47.100
and love each other without taboos

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.519
finally dying together for love

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:50.079
You're talking about

00:06:50.079 --> 00:06:51.620
Ximen Qing and Pan Jinlian, right

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.240
Who are these lovers

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.240
A pair of adulterers

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.480
Adulterers

00:06:58.639 --> 00:06:59.939
My suggestion is

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.800
why not do an elderly version of

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.980
Romeo and Juliet

00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:04.800
Wouldn't you say that's new

00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:06.240
This Romeo and Juliet

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.620
aren't young lovers

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.300
but a twilight romance

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.860
Seniors breaking through shackles

00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:13.220
and growing old together straight away

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.699
If that works

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:17.319
then we don't need to bother anyone else

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.720
Our Changqing Residence

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.240
is absolutely teeming with talent

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.139
We'll perform it for you for free

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.879
This Romeo

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.160
should be

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:28.360
played by me

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:30.660
My... image

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:32.560
is the closest match

00:07:32.579 --> 00:07:34.120
Oh, give it a rest

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.420
Who can understand your lines

00:07:36.579 --> 00:07:37.600
If we're acting

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.220
surely I'm the most suitable one, right

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.360
So my suggestion just benefits you

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:43.639
What I mean is

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.000
this Romeo

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.480
is best played by me

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.779
The problem is the female lead

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.279
Who will play Juliet

00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:51.399
Don't look at me

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:52.379
I can't act

00:07:52.439 --> 00:07:53.980
At most I'll play Wang Po

00:07:55.839 --> 00:07:57.339
This female lead

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.720
we actually have a suitable candidate right here

00:08:00.899 --> 00:08:01.959
This...

00:08:01.959 --> 00:08:03.899
this isn't quite appropriate

00:08:04.519 --> 00:08:07.639
Although I am a veteran arts worker

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.720
previously I

00:08:09.939 --> 00:08:12.519
always worked in children's theater

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.639
usually performing for children

00:08:16.259 --> 00:08:18.019
Basically I

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.839
haven't acted in romance plays

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:20.839
Basically

00:08:21.279 --> 00:08:22.959
Well, I have acted in one

00:08:23.459 --> 00:08:24.920
Wasn't there that one year

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.040
our unit

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.740
brought in a play from a foreign summer troupe

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.680
and had me play a...

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.139
What did you play

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.120
They had me play a female mantis

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.600
Actually fell in love with a...

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.519
Huangqiao.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.879
What is a Huangqiao?

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.340
Huangqiao is the siskin.

00:08:58.659 --> 00:08:59.539
Siskin.

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:00.419
Siskin.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:01.620
Right.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.539
In the end, they got married.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.379
Walked down the aisle together.

00:09:05.799 --> 00:09:06.679
How wonderful.

00:09:07.539 --> 00:09:08.940
Then later, that female cockroach...

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:09.980
What female cockroach?

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:10.940
It's a mantis.

00:09:11.179 --> 00:09:11.559
Right.

00:09:11.559 --> 00:09:12.419
Mantis.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.100
So what happened in the end?

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.500
In the end, that cockroach...

00:09:15.879 --> 00:09:16.320
No.

00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:17.299
No.

00:09:17.299 --> 00:09:18.960
Not a mantis, it's a cockroach.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.820
Xiao Cai, I...

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:20.440
Mantis.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.559
Right.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.879
In the end, this female mantis...

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.299
No... Boss Li, stop interrupting.

00:09:29.059 --> 00:09:29.779
Finally,

00:09:30.399 --> 00:09:31.539
the mantis,

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.059
full of emotion,

00:09:34.279 --> 00:09:35.539
with tears in her eyes,

00:09:35.879 --> 00:09:37.039
was, by the siskin,

00:09:37.179 --> 00:09:38.940
eaten up bite by bite.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.600
Not a crumb was left.

00:09:42.039 --> 00:09:44.299
What a poignant love story.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.679
You call that beautiful?

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.039
Ms. Liu,

00:09:47.039 --> 00:09:48.960
stop acting like such a diva.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.360
Me?

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.539
Tell me, for this role,

00:09:50.539 --> 00:09:51.940
who else but you?

00:09:52.259 --> 00:09:52.799
No...

00:09:52.799 --> 00:09:54.279
Should we let Grandma Jin play it?

00:09:54.399 --> 00:09:56.179
If Grandma Jin plays Juliet,

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.100
only Gou'er Ye could play Romeo.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.480
Boss Li, you just reminded me.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.700
If I play Juliet, who plays Romeo?

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.080
Does it even need saying?

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.559
Isn't it obvious? It's right there.

00:10:08.679 --> 00:10:09.620
Gou'er Ye?

00:10:10.059 --> 00:10:12.159
Like lice on a bald head—isn't it obvious?

00:10:12.539 --> 00:10:14.000
No, who is playing it?

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.200
Me!

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.259
Why does he get to play Grand Official Ximen?

00:10:44.259 --> 00:10:45.899
Why can't I play him?

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.580
My image and temperament are perfect.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.419
Born to play Ximen.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:53.399
What are you talking about?

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.080
I'm playing Romeo, okay?

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.500
The character's surname can be changed to Ximen.

00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:00.639
Director Hans said,

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:01.639
since we...

00:11:02.279 --> 00:11:03.220
in this play...

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.639
we want to add Chinese elements.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.980
So for this character,

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.019
we can change it to a Chinese surname.

00:11:09.379 --> 00:11:10.320
Change the name.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.440
Call him Ximen-meo.

00:11:13.519 --> 00:11:14.379
Ximen-meo.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.039
Hans...

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.399
Then, darn it, for this role...

00:11:17.399 --> 00:11:18.840
what Chinese elements should be added?

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.039
What Chinese elements for her role?

00:11:21.039 --> 00:11:22.600
She plays Juliet's Nurse.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.820
Playing matchmaker for their love.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.440
The director said,

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.440
this Nurse to Juliet you're playing,

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.840
for the sake of their love,

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.639
threads the needle,

00:11:35.039 --> 00:11:37.220
and helps move things along.

00:11:37.759 --> 00:11:38.539
It's basically Wang Po.

00:11:46.059 --> 00:11:46.600
Yingzi!

00:11:47.059 --> 00:11:47.580
Yingzi!

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:48.460
Auntie Cai is looking for you.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.340
My hands are full right now.

00:11:51.059 --> 00:11:51.860
Go quickly.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.100
The old lady is asking everyone.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.059
Seems pretty urgent.

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.580
What's it about?

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.000
She's looked for me several times.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.580
It must be...

00:12:00.899 --> 00:12:01.340
Alright.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:02.480
I got it, I'm going.

00:12:05.139 --> 00:12:05.659
Wait.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.860
Do you know what it is?

00:12:09.399 --> 00:12:11.379
Isn't it just Auntie Cai trying to set me up

00:12:11.379 --> 00:12:12.659
with Rudy's nephew?

00:12:23.419 --> 00:12:24.419
The One I Like

00:12:24.419 --> 00:12:25.919
Director Hans hopes

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:26.820
we

00:12:27.019 --> 00:12:28.039
in this

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:29.879
production of *Romeo and Juliet*,

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.240
can incorporate more Chinese elements.

00:12:34.759 --> 00:12:37.200
We welcome your very valuable opinions.

00:12:37.259 --> 00:12:37.740
Or...

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.820
your not-so-valuable opinions.

00:12:39.899 --> 00:12:41.960
Then let me offer a not-so-valuable opinion first.

00:12:42.039 --> 00:12:45.120
You see, for my role as the Nurse,

00:12:45.159 --> 00:12:47.720
can we not follow the style of Wang Po?

00:12:47.919 --> 00:12:49.639
In our Chinese opera,

00:12:49.639 --> 00:12:50.879
there is a character called Hongniang.

00:12:50.879 --> 00:12:51.360
Right.

00:12:51.419 --> 00:12:52.100
A young maiden role.

00:12:52.159 --> 00:12:52.820
Exactly.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:54.700
As soon as she gets on stage, she goes...

00:12:55.059 --> 00:12:58.379
"Early in the morning, I drew a wild card."

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.940
That's not Peking Opera!

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.120
You're playing Mahjong!

00:13:03.919 --> 00:13:05.980
The director has said,

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.019
we can try anything.

00:13:08.019 --> 00:13:10.399
If we can open up our thinking that much,

00:13:10.399 --> 00:13:12.740
then for my role, Cui Yingying's father,

00:13:12.799 --> 00:13:14.840
I can play him like the Old Yuanwai.

00:13:15.139 --> 00:13:17.179
Who is Old Yuanwai?

00:13:17.659 --> 00:13:19.299
Is Old Yuanwai here today?

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.740
Old Yuanwai is Cui Yingying's father.

00:13:23.139 --> 00:13:24.480
In your play, that's the Old Count.

00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:27.179
*Romance of the West Chamber*. Never heard of it?

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:29.360
If that's the case,

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.179
I'll write and perform a piece myself.

00:13:31.179 --> 00:13:31.759
How about that?

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:32.600
Good.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.639
Let me know if it's good or not.

00:13:33.639 --> 00:13:34.139
Okay?

00:13:34.139 --> 00:13:35.360
Okay.

00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:40.620
He's about to start singing.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.740
In days past, my fine youth flowed away like water.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.419
Sighing at life... Which play is this?

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:47.659
I don't know.

00:13:48.399 --> 00:13:49.480
*Temple of Eight Gods*?

00:13:50.299 --> 00:13:51.539
I didn't say that.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:52.559
With *Capture Alive*?

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.980
Who are you capturing alive?

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:58.759
*The Real and Fake Li Kui*?

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.580
Stop shouting.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.259
*Black Cat Detective*.

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:03.139
Then...

00:14:03.139 --> 00:14:04.620
how does that go?

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:10.860
Peerless tenderness.

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:13.299
Bravo!

00:14:13.299 --> 00:14:14.299
Great!

00:14:15.419 --> 00:14:17.139
That was sung beautifully!

00:14:17.659 --> 00:14:19.639
I didn't understand a word.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.159
That wasn't *Black Cat Detective*!

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.000
Isn't this *Romance of the West Chamber*?

00:14:27.179 --> 00:14:28.539
An old play.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.940
He sang the part of Cui Yingying's father.

00:14:32.139 --> 00:14:34.120
Cui Yingying's father is dead!

00:14:34.139 --> 00:14:35.519
You're confused again.

00:14:36.059 --> 00:14:37.580
I am not confused.

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:40.299
It's from *Romance of the West Chamber*,

00:14:40.299 --> 00:14:42.539
the part the Old Yuanwai sings.

00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:45.840
That Old Yuanwai is Cui Yingying's father!

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.759
She went down the mountain with Liang Shanbo.

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:50.100
And returned to life.

00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:50.919
In the end,

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.360
that's the part he was singing.

00:14:52.399 --> 00:14:54.559
In the end, he sang Liang Shanbo to death.

00:15:23.379 --> 00:15:23.899
Yingzi

00:15:25.019 --> 00:15:25.879
Auntie Cai...

00:15:26.679 --> 00:15:28.519
introduced you to that Parched guy?

00:15:28.779 --> 00:15:29.799
Yeah, she did.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:33.220
So you've met?

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.720
If she introduced us, of course we've met.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:38.940
Do you...

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:40.279
think he's okay?

00:15:40.919 --> 00:15:43.000
I think he's pretty good.

00:15:43.159 --> 00:15:44.100
He's quite interesting.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.480
Then what does he think of you?

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:48.679
He thinks I'm pretty good too.

00:15:48.879 --> 00:15:50.740
Says I meet his requirements.

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:57.759
You're not eating?

00:15:58.899 --> 00:15:59.700
I can't eat anymore.

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:07.379
Here, let me take that.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.059
Thanks, Zhuzhu.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:14.980
Why...

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:16.639
why hasn't the show started yet?

00:16:16.639 --> 00:16:17.600
It's over.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.179
Take it easy.

00:16:23.759 --> 00:16:24.600
Yusheng.

00:16:24.879 --> 00:16:26.480
Don't be too upset.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:28.799
The two of them just have a good impression of each other.

00:16:28.919 --> 00:16:30.919
But they definitely won't end up together.

00:16:31.039 --> 00:16:32.879
Even if they do end up together,

00:16:33.039 --> 00:16:34.480
theirs is a transnational romance.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:35.700
It definitely won't last long.

00:16:35.899 --> 00:16:37.100
Even if it lasts long,

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.080
they definitely won't walk down the aisle.

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.960
Even if they walk down the aisle,

00:16:42.179 --> 00:16:43.899
they definitely won't grow old together.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.000
Even if... Stop.

00:16:45.679 --> 00:16:47.159
Are you trying to comfort me?

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.940
You've planned their lives out to 2070.

00:16:50.179 --> 00:16:50.860
No,

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:52.679
that's just what I mean.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:53.379
Look,

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.860
Romeo and Juliet.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.899
Were they in love?

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.000
Was their love deep?

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:00.440
Was it solid?

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:01.480
And what was the result?

00:17:01.539 --> 00:17:03.179
Didn't they die in the end?

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:05.740
You mean,

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:07.339
Yingzi is Juliet,

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.180
and Parched is Romeo?

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:10.460
Then what about me?

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.400
I'm the one waiting to collect the bodies after they die for love?

00:17:13.759 --> 00:17:15.460
You have a terrible way with words.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:15.759
What?

00:17:15.759 --> 00:17:17.519
Why collect bodies?

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:19.880
Nowadays it's called one-stop funeral services.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.640
Get lost.

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:21.880
No, I...

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.339
Grandma, sorry about that.

00:17:32.039 --> 00:17:33.900
What are you doing?

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.900
The big moon of Verona

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.640
Balcony sweet talk is truly great

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.960
Ximen-meo and Juliet

00:17:45.079 --> 00:17:46.720
Tonight there will be

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.640
a new

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.500
a new sit

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.640
a new situation

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.359
Stop a moment

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.440
Director Hans says he has a headache

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.599
Could it be a migraine?

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:58.539
I have some herbal patches

00:17:58.539 --> 00:17:59.700
One stick and it works like a charm

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.200
Just don't know if a German

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.400
believes in our Chinese medicine

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.259
No

00:18:03.299 --> 00:18:04.640
It's not a headache, it's...

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:06.940
His head is a bit messy

00:18:07.259 --> 00:18:08.279
Head messy?

00:18:08.279 --> 00:18:10.400
You mean his hair is messy, right?

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:10.720
No

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.480
He says his mind is a mess

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.420
Really? Yes

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:15.819
His mind is a mess because of these

00:18:15.819 --> 00:18:16.400
What?

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:17.759
*Romance of the West Chamber*

00:18:17.759 --> 00:18:19.059
Ximen Qing and whatnot

00:18:19.059 --> 00:18:20.380
And that "West Wind" stuff

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:21.680
It's just too "West"

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.579
He wanted Chinese elements!

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.859
Didn't you say "When in Rome, do as the Romans do"?

00:18:26.859 --> 00:18:28.000
Exactly

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:29.160
He did say that

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.759
But Director Hans now

00:18:30.759 --> 00:18:32.599
feels something is wrong again

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.319
Can't say exactly what

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.000
I know what's wrong

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.920
What's your brilliant idea?

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:40.299
These past few days

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.500
I've browsed through a few more books

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.319
gathered wisdom from many experts

00:18:45.319 --> 00:18:47.039
and did some deep meditation

00:18:47.259 --> 00:18:48.640
Regarding this play of ours

00:18:48.779 --> 00:18:51.680
I have some further thoughts

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:53.440
That comrade asks: what thoughts?

00:18:53.539 --> 00:18:54.400
Who asked?

00:18:54.559 --> 00:18:55.799
Which comrade asked?

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.299
Well, our ancestors

00:18:58.299 --> 00:18:59.779
didn't they have a saying?

00:19:00.099 --> 00:19:00.920
Old people falling in love

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:02.859
is like an old house on fire—beyond saving

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:04.460
Did our ancestors

00:19:04.819 --> 00:19:06.200
have that saying?

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.000
If the professor says so, let's assume they did

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:09.380
No

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.579
what's your point?

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.279
My point is

00:19:12.559 --> 00:19:13.240
since

00:19:13.619 --> 00:19:15.480
old Romeo and old Juliet

00:19:15.759 --> 00:19:18.380
are a flammable, explosive old house

00:19:18.819 --> 00:19:20.599
when handling their relationship

00:19:21.279 --> 00:19:22.599
we can't do it like before

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.079
like typical twilight romance works

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:25.980
What do you want to do?

00:19:26.559 --> 00:19:28.079
Specifically for this scene

00:19:28.339 --> 00:19:29.259
I'm thinking

00:19:29.519 --> 00:19:30.819
I rush forward

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:32.220
and with Juliet

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:33.940
do a princess carry

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.319
No, what are you doing?

00:19:35.359 --> 00:19:36.259
That's a bit much

00:19:36.259 --> 00:19:38.220
I reckon my arm strength isn't enough

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:39.559
Might not be able to lift her

00:19:40.119 --> 00:19:40.839
Reckon what?

00:19:40.839 --> 00:19:42.359
You definitely can't lift her!

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.920
With that frame of yours

00:19:44.059 --> 00:19:46.019
you definitely can't do a carry

00:19:46.119 --> 00:19:47.319
A piggyback is more like it

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:48.700
Is a piggyback appropriate?

00:19:48.859 --> 00:19:50.539
Wouldn't that be rude to the beauty?

00:19:52.339 --> 00:19:53.220
What's wrong with a piggyback?

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.619
In our traditional Chinese opera

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.880
isn't there a scene called "Pigsy Carries His Wife"?

00:19:57.599 --> 00:19:58.660
Chinese elements!

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.279
Now you're being even more ridiculous

00:20:00.319 --> 00:20:02.400
Then why call it *Romeo and Juliet*?

00:20:03.039 --> 00:20:03.819
Just call it

00:20:03.859 --> 00:20:05.119
*Romeo and Pigsy*

00:20:06.599 --> 00:20:07.779
That's a great name!

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:08.779
Director Hans

00:20:08.819 --> 00:20:09.680
our play

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:11.359
how about we change the name to that?

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:13.279
No

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.799
Oh God, I can't take it anymore!

00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:16.299
Oh God, I can't take it anymore!

00:20:18.539 --> 00:20:19.980
He seems a bit reluctant

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.400
That kid turned on us

00:20:21.559 --> 00:20:22.599
With whom?

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.220
He just left like that?

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:26.660
He just dropped it and quit?

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:27.259
Yes

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:30.519
What's going on here?

00:20:30.519 --> 00:20:31.359
Hello, elders

00:20:31.839 --> 00:20:33.119
Where is our Director Hans?

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:34.759
He left

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.660
He left our retirement community

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:38.599
Why?

00:20:39.119 --> 00:20:39.799
He said

00:20:40.319 --> 00:20:42.019
working with you all

00:20:42.079 --> 00:20:42.920
is too tiring

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:43.740
His head

00:20:44.099 --> 00:20:45.619
is a mess

00:20:45.759 --> 00:20:46.720
No, but he

00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:48.000
just abandoned us?

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:48.859
That's right

00:20:49.359 --> 00:20:51.660
He went to Xincheng Kindergarten

00:20:52.579 --> 00:20:54.099
My grandson goes there

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:55.680
He said

00:20:56.039 --> 00:20:58.539
he'd rather go help the kids

00:20:58.619 --> 00:21:00.099
rehearse Romeo and Juliet

00:21:00.579 --> 00:21:02.700
We're worse than a bunch of little kids?

00:21:04.059 --> 00:21:05.819
I need to take leave and go check it out

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.059
If I can pull some strings

00:21:07.059 --> 00:21:08.539
maybe get my Doudou picked

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.240
Xiao Cai, come back

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:09.740
Okay

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.720
We Chinese have backbone

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:12.819
We don't beg for help

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.140
No, but

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.599
what do we do now? What do we do?

00:21:16.599 --> 00:21:16.980
Come on

00:21:17.539 --> 00:21:18.380
We'll rehearse it ourselves

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.240
I'll be the director

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:20.279
Old Li

00:21:20.299 --> 00:21:21.400
You continue as Romeo

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:21.680
You direct it

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.559
Ms. Liu, Juliet

00:21:22.559 --> 00:21:23.220
Alright

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:24.140
Xiao Cai

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:24.660
Matchmaker

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:25.140
You

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:25.799
No, behind you

00:21:25.799 --> 00:21:26.619
I'm not in this scene

00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:26.980
You wait in the wings

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:27.339
I'm not in this scene

00:21:27.339 --> 00:21:27.779
Rehearse us first

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:28.500
Hello, Grandma

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:28.920
Hello

00:21:30.539 --> 00:21:31.299
Hello, Grandpas and Grandmas

00:21:31.299 --> 00:21:32.460
Hello

00:21:35.839 --> 00:21:37.420
You're late

00:21:37.779 --> 00:21:39.039
What do you mean late?

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.519
Aren't you here to say goodbye to Hans?

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:43.640
He's gone

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:45.559
Who's here to say goodbye to him?

00:21:45.799 --> 00:21:48.859
Auntie Cai introduced me to be Hans's assistant

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:50.700
Not to be his girlfriend

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:54.839
Not a girlfri...

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.619
I thought...

00:21:58.339 --> 00:21:59.200
What did you think?

00:21:59.559 --> 00:22:00.460
What did you think it was?

00:22:00.799 --> 00:22:01.740
What exactly did you think?

00:22:01.799 --> 00:22:02.359
Yingzi

00:22:03.619 --> 00:22:04.579
Actually

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:05.960
I've always had a

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.420
dream of putting on a play

00:22:07.759 --> 00:22:08.579
I think now

00:22:08.579 --> 00:22:10.299
Romeo and Juliet is quite suitable

00:22:11.359 --> 00:22:12.299
I'll play Romeo

00:22:12.539 --> 00:22:13.259
You play Juliet

00:22:13.279 --> 00:22:14.240
What do you think? Great!

00:22:14.279 --> 00:22:14.960
Great!

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.099
Awesome!

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:17.500
Let's rehearse a real

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:18.779
Romeo and Juliet

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.640
How about I be your director?
