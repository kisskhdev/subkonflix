00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.959
Why are you whistling?

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:08.120
It's disturbing me while I watch the news.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.800
Fine, I won't whistle.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:14.759
*The sun is setting in the west*

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:16.099
Why did you start singing now?

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.780
Whistling was better than that.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.240
Fine, then I'll whistle.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.939
Where is my hand cream?

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:30.379
*Applying my beloved hand cream*

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.639
Old Fan.

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.439
You're acting a bit strange today.

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:36.319
Why are you so excited?

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.240
Did you find a wallet or something?

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:40.520
If you found a wallet, you must give it to Mr. Policeman.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.039
Otherwise, our "Drop the Hanky" song...

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:44.039
...would have been sung for nothing.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.000
Why would I sing "Drop the Hanky" if I found a wallet?

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:49.319
Who found a wallet?

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.780
Then why are you so excited today?

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.240
Am I excited?

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:55.280
Today in the activity room...

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.800
...they're showing the old movie *Railway Guerrillas*.

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.599
You're putting on hand cream just to watch *Railway Guerrillas*?

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.159
If we were watching *Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy*...

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:05.520
...you'd probably be applying wax to prevent frostbite!

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:07.639
Ms. Liu asked me out for tonight.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.719
To watch the movie together.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.199
*The sun is setting in the west*

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:21.080
*The end of the devils is drawing near*

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.319
Why are you shaking your head at me when you mention "devils"?

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.000
Ms. Liu is here.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.039
Liu...

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.840
...Xiao Cai.

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:33.080
What kind of name is "Liu Xiao Cai"?

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.879
I'm looking for Boss Li.

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:34.800
Alright, you two chat.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.020
*Strumming my beloved pipa*

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.000
*Singing those moving ballads*

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:42.439
Boss Li.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.159
Keeping up with national affairs?

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.379
I'm just getting a grasp...

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.879
...on the progress of the Qiongzhou Strait Bridge.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.379
What do you want with me?

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:56.800
You probably don't know yet, right?

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.719
Our community is hosting an old movie retrospective.

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:01.280
Tonight they're showing that...

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.000
...that...

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:04.120
...what's it called again?

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.240
*Railway Guerrillas*.

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:08.080
My goodness, you've grasped that too?

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.879
Heh.

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.159
That's impressive.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.159
Guess what?

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:12.840
I've been watching this movie since I was a kid.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.360
But I never really understood it.

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:16.079
Today is a good chance.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.000
Ms. Liu...

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.759
...went to watch it with Old Fan.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.040
My goodness, you've grasped that situation too?

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.279
That's so impressive.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.519
So...

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.959
I was thinking...

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.240
...that you and I...

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.040
You and me?

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.120
What would people say if they saw that?

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.920
I'm not going.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.839
Hey...

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:36.439
Why is being with me "improper"?

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.100
Suit yourself.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.220
If you won't go, forget it!

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:40.199
Honestly.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.079
*The sun is setting in the west*

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.240
*The sun is setting in the west*

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.379
Order something expensive, everyone.

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:30.019
Don't try to save me money.

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:31.259
Then I won't hold back.

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:34.139
Let's have braised prawns.

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:34.860
Alright.

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:36.060
Old Fan.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.339
Don't be stingy.

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:38.699
I can pay for this myself.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.259
What kind of talk is that?

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:41.660
Why would I be stingy?

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:43.939
Since that's the case.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.620
Then let's have the one-pound braised prawns.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.740
One for each person.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.019
Do you have...

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:52.660
...one-pound prawns?

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.500
Why wouldn't there be?

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.300
This big.

00:05:56.019 --> 00:05:57.379
Red ones, I've seen them.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.899
Just the claws weigh half a pound.

00:05:58.899 --> 00:06:00.339
You're talking about lobster.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.459
You said it.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:03.459
Serve lobster.

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:04.399
Boss Li.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.300
We aren't a seafood restaurant.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.620
We don't have lobster.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:08.379
You don't?

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.259
Then he got off cheap.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.220
Wang Song.

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:12.980
As long as there's lobster here.

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:14.300
Keep them coming.

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:16.019
Don't try to save me money.

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:17.139
Do you have it?

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:18.139
No.

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:19.339
That, we can have.

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:20.379
That...

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.420
We really don't.

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:23.259
Old Fan.

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:26.100
Why so generous today?

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.420
Treating everyone to a meal?

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:32.139
I get it.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.860
The wallet you found last night...

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.379
...you didn't give to Mr. Policeman.

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:37.620
Who didn't give it to the police?

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:40.019
Who found a wallet?

00:06:40.019 --> 00:06:41.660
Then where did you get the money to treat us?

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:42.779
And ordering lobster too.

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:43.980
Who ordered lobster?

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.579
This place definitely doesn't have lobster, right?

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:49.379
Since you won't tell the truth.

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:50.980
We shouldn't ask too much.

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:53.120
But using money from unknown sources...

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.180
...to treat us to dinner...

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.660
...we won't eat this meal.

00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:56.899
Right, everyone?

00:06:56.899 --> 00:06:57.699
Let's go.

00:06:57.699 --> 00:06:58.420
Let's leave.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.600
Leave? Why?

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:00.579
Xiao Cai.

00:07:00.579 --> 00:07:01.100
You sit.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.819
Going where?

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:02.699
Nowhere, I'm not going anywhere.

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:03.720
Why are we leaving?

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.420
Sit down.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.180
Not leaving.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.899
Who said my money is from an unknown source?

00:07:06.899 --> 00:07:07.740
Then why are you hemming and hawing?

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:08.899
Why don't you dare say it straight?

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:10.220
Who doesn't dare?

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.259
This is money I made investing in stocks.

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:14.300
Fair and square.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.420
I have a student.

00:07:17.899 --> 00:07:20.060
From our Guanghua School of Management.

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:21.779
He often advises me.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.300
Saying money just sitting there is wasted.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.459
Better to take it out.

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:26.860
Invest in the stock market.

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:28.459
Firstly, to support national construction.

00:07:28.459 --> 00:07:29.980
Secondly, to make some money.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.019
Really?

00:07:31.019 --> 00:07:32.379
You make it sound so real.

00:07:32.379 --> 00:07:33.819
Who among us believes that?

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:35.180
Believe it or not.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.720
Can you stop speaking for everyone?

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.180
Wang Song, serve the dishes.

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:40.860
Wait, serve what dishes?

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.620
We haven't ordered a single hot dish yet.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:43.420
Right.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.060
Come on, let's order one to eat.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.180
Don't fall asleep.

00:07:46.259 --> 00:07:46.899
Time to eat.

00:07:49.819 --> 00:07:50.480
Here.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.540
Everyone, taste my tea.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:53.699
It's authentic.

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:54.660
Pre-Rain Maojian.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.180
Fresh tea just harvested this year.

00:07:57.339 --> 00:07:57.800
Uh,

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.620
Old Li doesn't like tea.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.620
No need to pour any for him.

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:00.660
Why shouldn't I?

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:02.660
Old Fan,

00:08:03.459 --> 00:08:04.339
treating everyone to tea,

00:08:04.339 --> 00:08:06.220
can't you use a bigger teapot?

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:08.220
How is this enough for everyone?

00:08:08.259 --> 00:08:09.579
What do you know?

00:08:09.579 --> 00:08:11.379
That's how Gongfu tea is supposed to be drunk.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.579
And to think you were a boss for so many years.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.939
What about being a boss?

00:08:15.379 --> 00:08:17.060
Who says it has to be drunk this way?

00:08:17.139 --> 00:08:18.699
Is there an official document for tea?

00:08:19.019 --> 00:08:20.699
Which department of the Tea Association stamped it?

00:08:21.899 --> 00:08:23.420
Grandpa Fan, Grandpa Li,

00:08:23.459 --> 00:08:25.459
why do you bicker about everything?

00:08:25.459 --> 00:08:26.379
Hurry up and taste it.

00:08:26.379 --> 00:08:27.420
It tastes really good.

00:08:27.699 --> 00:08:29.060
There's no hard rule,

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.300
but surely you've seen *Dream of the Red Chamber*?

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:32.620
The TV series, right?

00:08:33.019 --> 00:08:34.100
Which version? Which version?

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:34.899
I've seen them all.

00:08:34.899 --> 00:08:36.299
Miaoyu put it well:

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.379
One cup is for tasting,

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.500
two cups are for quenching thirst,

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:41.899
and someone like you,

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.500
holding an

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.779
extra-large thermos all day long,

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:46.299
is drinking like a mule.

00:08:46.779 --> 00:08:47.620
Don't get mad at me.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:48.899
That's what it says in *Dream of the Red Chamber*.

00:08:48.899 --> 00:08:50.379
Who else should I get mad at?

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.580
Which version of *Dream of the Red Chamber* mentions a thermos?

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:53.220
Find it for me.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:54.399
Find it.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.820
No, uh, Grandpa Fan,

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:57.299
um,

00:08:57.299 --> 00:08:59.460
this gentleman says he has an appointment with you.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:00.259
Xiao Qian!

00:09:00.259 --> 00:09:00.940
Hello, Professor Fan.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:01.779
Come, come over here.

00:09:01.779 --> 00:09:03.220
Taste my Pre-Rain Maojian.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:04.139
No thanks.

00:09:04.539 --> 00:09:05.340
Professor Fan,

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:06.460
let's...

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:07.779
speak in private.

00:09:10.419 --> 00:09:11.980
Making a little money from stocks,

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.860
what's there to hide?

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:16.419
There are no outsiders here.

00:09:16.419 --> 00:09:17.700
They are all my good friends.

00:09:18.179 --> 00:09:18.980
Everyone,

00:09:19.259 --> 00:09:20.460
this is my student,

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.139
a top graduate from the School of Management,

00:09:22.139 --> 00:09:23.379
Qian Buyi.

00:09:24.059 --> 00:09:25.299
That's a good name.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.299
Making money isn't easy for anyone.

00:09:27.779 --> 00:09:28.580
Alright then.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:30.740
This here,

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.379
is the 30,000 yuan earned from this trade.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:34.740
And the trade records,

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.139
and tax clearance certificates.

00:09:36.419 --> 00:09:37.500
Please count it.

00:09:38.059 --> 00:09:39.340
No need, Xiao Qian.

00:09:40.139 --> 00:09:40.940
I mean,

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.100
thank you for your hard work.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:42.820
Xiao Qian.

00:09:43.179 --> 00:09:44.500
Professor, you're too kind.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.740
Without your mentorship,

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:47.299
I wouldn't be where I am today.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.220
Professor, you guys chat.

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.100
I'll be going now.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.659
Won't you stay a bit longer?

00:09:51.659 --> 00:09:52.320
No.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.940
My car is at the gate, temporarily parked.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:56.659
You drove here?

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.899
Is it that new car you got last month?

00:09:59.179 --> 00:10:00.259
You bought another one?

00:10:00.899 --> 00:10:02.460
Okay, drive safely.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.220
Will do.

00:10:06.059 --> 00:10:07.120
Sit down.

00:10:08.019 --> 00:10:09.259
What's the big deal?

00:10:09.259 --> 00:10:10.379
This little bit of money.

00:10:10.779 --> 00:10:11.940
Back in my day,

00:10:12.539 --> 00:10:14.419
I'd handle millions or tens of millions a day.

00:10:14.419 --> 00:10:15.580
Passing through my hands.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.700
So how much did you skim off?

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:18.340
Me?

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:19.100
No.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.460
Money passed through my hands,

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:22.740
but the motherland stayed in my heart.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.419
Managing money and goods for thirty years,

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:25.899
with completely clean hands.

00:10:26.779 --> 00:10:28.019
Since you're retired now,

00:10:28.019 --> 00:10:29.340
you could dabble in stocks.

00:10:30.059 --> 00:10:31.059
Make a little money.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.220
Become the first to get rich...

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.379
...or the ones who get rich later.

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:34.740
Look at your mindset.

00:10:35.539 --> 00:10:38.179
Your goal in stocks is just to rake in cash.

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:39.179
Getting something for nothing.

00:10:40.059 --> 00:10:41.860
So I've become an unscrupulous merchant?

00:10:42.299 --> 00:10:43.500
I wouldn't say unscrupulous merchant.

00:10:44.179 --> 00:10:46.100
But different from the broad masses.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:47.899
Look at Master Gou.

00:10:48.179 --> 00:10:49.299
Relies on hard work in the fields.

00:10:49.659 --> 00:10:50.460
Ms. Liu,

00:10:50.659 --> 00:10:51.659
relies on performing for a living.

00:10:51.899 --> 00:10:53.539
Xiao Cai relies on matchmaking.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.539
Old Liang relies on his daughter's contributions.

00:10:55.539 --> 00:10:56.220
Wait.

00:10:56.539 --> 00:10:58.500
Why do you keep nagging about me?

00:10:59.539 --> 00:11:01.299
Fine, I can't out-talk you.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:02.580
I'm going back to my room.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.220
Going back won't help me avoid you.

00:11:05.379 --> 00:11:07.620
I'm going to Ms. Liu's room for tea.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:08.899
Sister Liu,

00:11:09.659 --> 00:11:11.220
you wouldn't mind, would you?

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:12.139
No.

00:11:12.139 --> 00:11:13.759
How could I? Welcome.

00:11:13.759 --> 00:11:14.340
Good.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:16.620
Professor Fan!

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.659
Why did you leave while we were chatting?

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.139
Professor Fan!

00:11:20.899 --> 00:11:21.840
Don't... Xiao Cai.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:22.860
Don't chase him.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:23.659
Let them go.

00:11:25.539 --> 00:11:27.139
I have to keep an eye on things for you.

00:11:27.139 --> 00:11:28.340
I'll report back to you later.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:28.980
This...

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.299
Do I need a lookout?

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.019
You'd better hurry up!

00:11:41.559 --> 00:11:42.720
Come on.

00:11:42.779 --> 00:11:43.500
Take the seat of honor.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:43.980
Saved it for you.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:44.620
Hurry, hurry.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:45.279
Hurry and sit here.

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:45.840
I'll order.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:46.539
I'm ordering.

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:49.179
Green pepper shredded potatoes.

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.340
Spicy shredded potato salad.

00:11:51.899 --> 00:11:53.460
Mustard greens and cucumber strips.

00:11:53.759 --> 00:11:55.240
Any meat dishes? Yes.

00:11:55.779 --> 00:11:57.299
Fish-flavored shredded pork.

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.299
Xiaoxin, cancel all these dishes.

00:12:00.299 --> 00:12:01.659
Just brew us a pot of jasmine tea.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:02.700
We have things to discuss.

00:12:02.899 --> 00:12:03.700
Okay.

00:12:05.179 --> 00:12:05.820
That works too.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:07.620
Xiao Cai.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.820
Don't beat around the bush or hide things from me.

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:10.779
Speak your mind.

00:12:10.899 --> 00:12:11.860
What do you want with me?

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:14.759
Here, give it to me.

00:12:14.759 --> 00:12:15.240
Give it to me.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:16.799
Um...

00:12:21.399 --> 00:12:23.080
Then I'll just be straight with you, okay?

00:12:24.159 --> 00:12:24.960
Look...

00:12:25.639 --> 00:12:26.440
Have a drink.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:27.799
Today...

00:12:27.799 --> 00:12:29.360
That student of yours came by.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.879
And gave you money.

00:12:31.519 --> 00:12:32.820
That money...

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.200
It's all real, right?

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.200
What are you saying?

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.480
My student...

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.980
Would give me fake bills? Spirit money?

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:40.600
No...

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.720
That's not what I meant.

00:12:42.399 --> 00:12:43.200
It's just...

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.919
That money is clean, right?

00:12:48.039 --> 00:12:49.120
That's even more outrageous.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:49.879
If it's not clean...

00:12:49.879 --> 00:12:51.000
Or was it stolen?

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.480
No, that's not what I meant.

00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:54.399
What I mean is...

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.399
That money really came from your stock trading, right?

00:12:58.399 --> 00:12:59.879
How could that be fake?

00:13:00.639 --> 00:13:01.440
This student of mine...

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.679
Studied finance.

00:13:02.679 --> 00:13:04.399
Specializes in stock research.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.639
Why?

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.159
Did Old Li send you to check my accounts?

00:13:09.399 --> 00:13:10.440
No way.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.200
No one is checking up on you.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.120
No.

00:13:13.559 --> 00:13:15.440
What I actually wanted to say is...

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.220
You see, I...

00:13:21.799 --> 00:13:23.639
am not exactly well-off.

00:13:23.919 --> 00:13:25.299
My husband passed away early,

00:13:26.279 --> 00:13:27.759
living expenses are high,

00:13:28.679 --> 00:13:30.399
my daughter-in-law is wicked,

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.000
and my son isn't filial.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.799
Only my little grandson is sweet,

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.399
but he's still too young.

00:13:36.879 --> 00:13:37.759
You tell me,

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.100
when this child grows up,

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.679
going to school, going to work,

00:13:40.679 --> 00:13:42.580
dating, getting married, buying a house,

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.559
doesn't everything cost money?

00:13:44.559 --> 00:13:45.059
Right?

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.120
So regarding this,

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.519
if you don't help me,

00:13:48.519 --> 00:13:50.600
no one else can.

00:13:51.879 --> 00:13:52.679
Well...

00:13:53.799 --> 00:13:54.879
I am a...

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.240
single man.

00:13:57.799 --> 00:13:59.799
It's not quite appropriate for me to help you, is it?

00:13:59.919 --> 00:14:01.639
No, what are you thinking?

00:14:01.759 --> 00:14:02.720
You really have an imagination.

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.519
No,

00:14:04.559 --> 00:14:06.039
I'll be straight with you.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:07.919
Can you...

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.840
take me along to make money in stocks?

00:14:11.679 --> 00:14:13.240
You want to trade stocks?

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.000
Yes!

00:14:14.519 --> 00:14:15.639
You trade stocks too?

00:14:15.639 --> 00:14:16.799
Don't shout!

00:14:16.799 --> 00:14:17.440
Shh!

00:14:17.799 --> 00:14:19.639
Don't let anyone hear.

00:14:19.919 --> 00:14:21.080
You trade stocks too?

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:22.960
Of course.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.480
Who doesn't want to make money?

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.120
Didn't you have a saying?

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.360
Money just sits there if you leave it,

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.039
but if you use it to earn,

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.919
one begets two, two begets three,

00:14:31.919 --> 00:14:33.240
and three begets a million.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.279
That's not certain.

00:14:35.399 --> 00:14:36.720
In stock trading,

00:14:36.879 --> 00:14:38.399
you win some, you lose some.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.320
What if you lose?

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.440
That's impossible.

00:14:40.759 --> 00:14:42.200
Really, who are you?

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.039
A great professor.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.600
And who is your student?

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.879
Someone in finance and stocks, right?

00:14:46.879 --> 00:14:48.639
With such high IQs between the two of you,

00:14:48.639 --> 00:14:49.200
if you lose money,

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.919
no one can make money. No one.

00:14:50.919 --> 00:14:52.120
That is true,

00:14:52.679 --> 00:14:54.279
I knew it.

00:14:55.799 --> 00:14:58.200
You're a brazier in June,

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.080
clearly a warm-hearted person.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.200
Do you have the heart to watch someone in need like me,

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.960
and not lend a hand?

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.519
If you weren't a good person,

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.120
would Ms. Liu praise you like that behind your back?

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:11.960
Really?

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.799
Then how did Ms. Liu praise me?

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.320
She praised... just praised...

00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:18.679
Oh, how she praised you!

00:15:18.679 --> 00:15:19.440
What?

00:15:19.799 --> 00:15:20.600
Praised...

00:15:20.799 --> 00:15:21.519
There were too many good words,

00:15:21.519 --> 00:15:22.480
I can't even repeat them all.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.360
Anyway, in a nutshell,

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.360
if you have trouble, find the Professor.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.440
You should call the police if you're in trouble.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.720
You handle what the police can't.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.360
Can the police handle stock trading?

00:15:38.919 --> 00:15:39.720
Fine.

00:15:39.919 --> 00:15:41.679
Since you put it that way...

00:15:41.679 --> 00:15:42.879
I'll reluctantly...

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.259
...help you trade a bit.

00:15:45.519 --> 00:15:46.519
But let me be clear.

00:15:46.519 --> 00:15:48.200
I'm not responsible for losses or gains.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.320
If you're not responsible, who is?

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.559
Come on.

00:15:53.679 --> 00:15:55.320
That's impossible, right?

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.360
As long as you're involved...

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.960
...there's no way we'll lose.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.440
It's settled then, no changes.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.179
Honestly.

00:16:00.679 --> 00:16:01.720
Let me tell you...

00:16:02.399 --> 00:16:04.039
...you have to keep this a secret for me.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.200
Don't tell anyone else.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.240
Okay, I will.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.299
You know why I won't tell anyone?

00:16:10.059 --> 00:16:12.299
I can't let my daughter-in-law know about this.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.460
The money I'm using for stocks...

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:16.620
...is my secret stash and nest egg.

00:16:17.659 --> 00:16:19.019
If that little vixen finds out...

00:16:19.019 --> 00:16:21.220
...who knows what stunt she'll pull.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.720
Okay, I'll keep it a secret.

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:24.980
So, how much do you plan...

00:16:25.019 --> 00:16:26.100
...to put in?

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.019
To buy stocks.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.299
If we're buying, let's go big.

00:16:31.299 --> 00:16:33.059
I'll put in 200 yuan.

00:16:35.539 --> 00:16:36.340
Two hundred?

00:16:37.299 --> 00:16:37.799
You should keep that...

00:16:37.799 --> 00:16:39.379
...to buy lollipops for your grandson.

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:41.580
Too little? I can add more.

00:16:41.779 --> 00:16:43.059
How about 230?

00:16:43.059 --> 00:16:43.779
Two hundred...

00:16:44.279 --> 00:16:45.379
Professor...

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:46.419
Two hundred and fifty.

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:47.740
Is 250 okay?

00:16:58.899 --> 00:16:59.700
Come in.

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:02.500
Professor Fan.

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:04.099
Boss Li isn't here, is he?

00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:05.900
He went to do Tai Chi.

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:08.140
Why are you being so sneaky?

00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:09.859
Good, he's not here.

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:13.740
Professor Fan.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.240
I just withdrew this from the bank.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:17.920
Ten thousand yuan.

00:17:18.539 --> 00:17:19.900
Count it.

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:22.539
It is ten thousand.

00:17:23.019 --> 00:17:24.059
This is just pocket change.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.019
I mean, this is what you call pocket change.

00:17:26.019 --> 00:17:26.859
Qian Buyi.

00:17:27.059 --> 00:17:29.140
Invest this money in the stock market ASAP.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:30.059
Buy stocks with it.

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:35.019
Professor Fan, this is my nest egg.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.859
Shouldn't we find a stock...

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.819
...that only makes a profit?

00:17:41.579 --> 00:17:43.059
Is there such a stock?

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.420
Didn't I tell you already?

00:17:45.819 --> 00:17:46.859
No one can guarantee...

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.019
...a profit without loss.

00:17:51.099 --> 00:17:52.259
If that's your requirement...

00:17:52.259 --> 00:17:53.059
Sister Cai...

00:17:53.099 --> 00:17:55.180
...I suggest you don't trade.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:56.140
No...

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:56.640
No...

00:17:57.059 --> 00:17:57.980
I was just joking with you.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:59.180
Don't take it seriously.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:00.599
No, it's just...

00:18:00.599 --> 00:18:02.299
If I happen to lose it...

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:06.099
I'll just treat it as a contribution to national construction.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:07.900
That's not it...

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.140
The country isn't short of my money, right?

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:10.859
You say...

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:11.579
Just rest assured.

00:18:11.579 --> 00:18:12.859
Leave it to me, okay?

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.299
You're such a big professor,

00:18:21.059 --> 00:18:22.500
folding your own bedding?

00:18:22.599 --> 00:18:23.859
Let me do it.

00:18:23.859 --> 00:18:24.660
This is my bedding.

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:25.960
Why should I trouble you to fold it?

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:26.380
Don't.

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:28.500
I should. You even helped me make money.

00:18:29.059 --> 00:18:31.539
I can't guarantee I'll make you money.

00:18:31.539 --> 00:18:32.900
Then I must help even more.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:33.579
I'll do it.

00:18:33.799 --> 00:18:34.740
Let me do it.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.299
You...

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:37.859
What's going on here?

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:40.339
Playing tug-of-war?

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:41.180
No.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:41.819
No.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.980
I was actually...

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:45.660
trying to tidy up this bed for you.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.740
Look, it's so neat.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:48.539
I took one look,

00:18:48.539 --> 00:18:50.019
and I just helped Professor Fan

00:18:50.019 --> 00:18:51.299
fold it a little.

00:18:52.099 --> 00:18:53.660
Is today International Bed-Folding Day?

00:18:53.859 --> 00:18:55.420
No.

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:57.180
Everyone has two hands.

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:58.460
Old Fan,

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.259
can't you fold your own quilt?

00:19:01.299 --> 00:19:02.819
Don't expect to be waited on hand and foot.

00:19:02.819 --> 00:19:03.420
That's not it.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:04.980
Maids make beds, laborers walk dogs.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:05.500
No...

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:05.920
It's...

00:19:06.019 --> 00:19:06.859
Lazy and stupid.

00:19:06.859 --> 00:19:07.660
Decadent and rotten.

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:08.380
No, I...

00:19:08.819 --> 00:19:09.619
Xiao Cai,

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.539
if Old Fan bullies you again in the future,

00:19:11.539 --> 00:19:12.240
just tell me.

00:19:12.859 --> 00:19:13.819
I'll deal with him.

00:19:15.059 --> 00:19:16.579
I'm so wronged.

00:19:22.019 --> 00:19:24.299
Lower. Right level carry.

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.940
Left level carry. Retract foot.

00:19:28.339 --> 00:19:30.220
Twist waist, swing sword.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.140
One-legged swing and chop.

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:37.400
Professor Fan, you scared me to death!

00:19:37.579 --> 00:19:38.180
Are you okay?

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:39.140
This one-legged swing and chop...

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.500
is really hard to balance.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.079
Right.

00:19:41.079 --> 00:19:41.920
Professor Fan,

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.000
you don't get enough exercise.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.319
Ms. Liu,

00:19:45.319 --> 00:19:46.759
look at you, going left and right,

00:19:46.759 --> 00:19:47.960
swinging wildly,

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:48.759
and chopping away.

00:19:48.759 --> 00:19:49.799
Look at Professor Fan,

00:19:49.799 --> 00:19:50.880
his forehead is covered in sweat.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.759
Why don't we let him rest a bit?

00:19:52.759 --> 00:19:53.819
No, I'm not tired.

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:54.500
I'm not tired.

00:19:54.779 --> 00:19:55.559
Xiao Cai,

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:56.680
why don't you find somewhere cool

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.799
and go rest there for a while?

00:19:57.799 --> 00:19:58.559
What are you saying?

00:19:58.559 --> 00:20:00.119
You've practiced so long and aren't tired?

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.759
I'm tired just watching from the side.

00:20:01.759 --> 00:20:02.880
That's ridiculous.

00:20:03.519 --> 00:20:05.759
Ms. Liu is tired.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.079
How about, Ms. Liu,

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.319
you find a cool place

00:20:08.319 --> 00:20:09.259
to cool off?

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.279
Well, how about we stop here for today?

00:20:11.279 --> 00:20:12.000
Alright.

00:20:12.359 --> 00:20:14.160
I'll head back first, Professor Fan.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:14.920
Don't.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:15.559
Ms. Liu,

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.640
I finally managed to stand

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.160
with a tiny bit of improvement.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.200
How can you, the master, leave now?

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.079
Let's keep practicing.

00:20:21.079 --> 00:20:22.700
I'm not tired at all, really.

00:20:23.039 --> 00:20:25.400
You're not tired, but I am!

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.039
You...

00:20:26.519 --> 00:20:28.299
Alright then, let's sit here and rest a bit.

00:20:28.299 --> 00:20:29.099
Then, rest here a bit.

00:20:29.099 --> 00:20:29.640
Okay.

00:20:29.859 --> 00:20:30.440
Okay.

00:20:30.759 --> 00:20:32.039
Alright, hold this.

00:20:32.039 --> 00:20:33.000
Thanks, Yingzi.

00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:36.240
By the way, Professor Fan,

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.359
I think besides paying attention to exercise,

00:20:39.359 --> 00:20:40.920
aside from that kind of activity,

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:41.920
it's very important

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.000
for us seniors

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.240
to watch our diet.

00:20:44.559 --> 00:20:45.880
We really must be careful. Right.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.799
Like things high in cholesterol,

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.240
greasy fried foods,

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.880
and things with too much sugar or salt.

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.279
We should try to eat less of those.

00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:53.799
You're right.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:54.799
Ms. Liu,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.480
why don't you help me make a meal plan?

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.240
Every day, I'll follow the plan you make

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.000
for my meals.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:00.759
Okay?

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:01.799
Listen to me.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.200
Yingzi here is speaking very professionally.

00:21:05.559 --> 00:21:06.200
All right then.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:06.740
Then I...

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:07.039
Here...

00:21:07.039 --> 00:21:08.519
I'll give you a little advice.

00:21:09.079 --> 00:21:09.759
For breakfast,

00:21:09.759 --> 00:21:10.519
for example,

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.279
drink milk and eat eggs.

00:21:13.519 --> 00:21:15.640
You should avoid fried dough sticks.

00:21:16.839 --> 00:21:18.200
Good thing you said that.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.440
I just love fried dough sticks.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.200
You kid, just eat as much as you like.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.200
What business is it of yours?

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:23.680
Professor Fan,

00:21:23.779 --> 00:21:24.200
we, uh...

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.160
I think what Ms. Liu said

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.400
really makes sense.

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:27.759
Starting tomorrow,

00:21:27.759 --> 00:21:28.480
fried dough sticks...

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:29.599
I'm quitting them.

00:21:29.819 --> 00:21:30.799
Quitting.

00:21:30.799 --> 00:21:31.559
Well, no...

00:21:31.559 --> 00:21:32.880
Listen to me, listen.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.039
It's not that absolute.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.119
Usually,

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.160
eating just a little bit is still okay.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.839
Right, eat less.

00:21:41.599 --> 00:21:42.400
Ms. Liu,

00:21:43.039 --> 00:21:44.539
Yusheng is looking for you.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.960
I forgot to tell you.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.940
Look, give me that first...

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:48.319
Okay.

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:49.279
You guys keep chatting.

00:21:49.279 --> 00:21:50.200
I'm going to find Yusheng.

00:21:51.079 --> 00:21:51.700
See you later.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.980
Ms. Liu, let me go with you.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.500
Why go with her?

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.920
I had a hard time sending Ms. Liu away.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.000
Sending her away?

00:21:59.599 --> 00:22:00.420
What do you mean?

00:22:00.799 --> 00:22:02.359
So Yusheng wasn't looking for her?

00:22:02.519 --> 00:22:03.720
He was looking for her,

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.359
but that was yesterday.

00:22:06.839 --> 00:22:08.640
Aren't you holding things up?

00:22:09.079 --> 00:22:10.279
You two are endless.

00:22:10.279 --> 00:22:11.759
You're holding up my business.

00:22:12.319 --> 00:22:13.599
What business is it?

00:22:13.599 --> 00:22:15.160
The stocks!

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.640
At eight o'clock this morning,

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.880
I gave you ten thousand yuan, right?

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:21.440
Right.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.000
It's been six hours.

00:22:24.359 --> 00:22:25.759
How is my money doing?

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.200
You have to give me some news.

00:22:28.519 --> 00:22:30.720
I'm really amazed by you, sister.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.440
That ten thousand of yours is all in stocks.

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:36.160
Good heavens!

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.240
My money is all in stocks now?

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.519
Which stock did you end up buying?

00:22:41.519 --> 00:22:42.339
Let me check.

00:22:42.339 --> 00:22:44.599
The one that's a sure win?

00:22:44.759 --> 00:22:45.920
That's not necessarily true.

00:22:46.319 --> 00:22:47.480
Didn't I tell you?

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.640
Stocks that are a sure win...

00:22:49.799 --> 00:22:50.599
Enough.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.359
Don't waste time lecturing me.

00:22:53.359 --> 00:22:55.359
I just want to know if I lost or made money.

00:22:55.359 --> 00:22:56.279
Or what happened.

00:22:56.279 --> 00:22:57.920
Hurry up and call to check.

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:58.759
Here, let me help you.

00:22:58.819 --> 00:22:59.519
Let me help you.

00:22:59.519 --> 00:23:00.200
Okay.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:00.619
What's the number?

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.319
What's the number? I'll help.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.079
You are such a hassle.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.039
Xiao Qian.

00:23:08.579 --> 00:23:09.839
Yes, it's Professor Fan.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.839
That 10,000 yuan I gave you this morning.

00:23:12.559 --> 00:23:13.279
Right.

00:23:14.339 --> 00:23:15.019
What?

00:23:15.299 --> 00:23:16.099
Really?

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:19.519
Let's leave it at that for now.

00:23:19.519 --> 00:23:20.599
Okay, I'm hanging up.
