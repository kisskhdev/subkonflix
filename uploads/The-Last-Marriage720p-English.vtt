00:15.120 --> 00:16.640
Janne, Janne!

00:18.440 --> 00:20.240
There's one outside the window.

00:22.840 --> 00:25.560
Ok. It probably snuck in where
the fence leans a little.

00:25.640 --> 00:26.720
I'll fix it tomorrow.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.560
No, do it now.
I can't sleep with it there.

00:28.640 --> 00:30.440
-Sure you can.
-No!

00:31.240 --> 00:33.040
It's moaning and it's your turn.

00:34.360 --> 00:35.880
Yeah, but it's more afraid of you
that you are of it.

00:35.960 --> 00:37.400
Go on now!

00:39.520 --> 00:41.200
Oh, for fuck's sake!

00:53.480 --> 00:56.080
So, are you happy now, dear?

00:56.480 --> 00:58.200
Very happy. Thanks, dear.

02:02.480 --> 02:09.160
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

02:41.960 --> 02:43.240
Happy birthday!

02:43.320 --> 02:44.720
Happy birthday, darling.

02:49.240 --> 02:50.720
Cut it out!

02:57.440 --> 02:59.720
-Yes!
-No!

03:01.440 --> 03:03.560
More Chateauneuf du pape?

03:03.640 --> 03:05.160
<i>Oui, monsieur.</i>

03:05.240 --> 03:07.960
And you just have to try
the Skoal the mailman had.

03:08.440 --> 03:09.480
How dry is it?

03:09.720 --> 03:11.600
Extremely,
but it's OK if you soak it a little.

03:12.040 --> 03:13.120
OK.

03:13.840 --> 03:15.560
Did it have anything else?

03:15.640 --> 03:17.600
Yeah, it had some newspapers too.

03:19.200 --> 03:21.240
-Shit!
-What the hell?

03:21.600 --> 03:22.880
Come on.

03:29.040 --> 03:32.400
Yeah, there's no problem,
the cord is just a little loose.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.880
Then why haven't you already fixed it?

03:34.960 --> 03:38.000
But I will fix it.
I have another cord in the tool shed.

03:43.880 --> 03:45.400
I guess I won't need
to remind you about it then?

03:45.480 --> 03:47.000
No, nope. No need.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.840
Ta da!

04:04.360 --> 04:07.320
-Can I ask you something?
-Of course. Fire away.

04:12.760 --> 04:15.120
Do you think we still have good sex?

04:17.360 --> 04:19.160
Yeah, I think so.

04:20.480 --> 04:22.400
Or what then? Don't you think so?

04:22.480 --> 04:25.040
Yeah, I guess so. You have to say so...

04:25.440 --> 04:26.800
Good.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.600
But it would be fun to have sex
in some unexpected place sometime.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.880
Of course. Absolutely!

04:35.280 --> 04:37.520
-Do you get what I'm saying?
-Yes, yes.

04:38.800 --> 04:42.280
Absolutely,
I think it's good that you mentioned it.

04:42.720 --> 04:43.960
Great idea.

05:08.520 --> 05:12.960
There aren't so many unexpected places
to have sex here.

05:13.880 --> 05:16.760
There's the cabin and the yard.

05:17.080 --> 05:19.320
You don't need to turn this
into a thing, Janne.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.760
No, no. It's absolutely not a thing.

05:22.560 --> 05:26.600
I just wonder
how it would work practically,

05:27.920 --> 05:29.000
given the space.

05:29.320 --> 05:33.720
It's just that I want you
to just want me here and now

05:33.800 --> 05:36.840
and kinda rip my clothes off.

05:37.560 --> 05:38.720
Yeah.

05:44.200 --> 05:45.680
On the other hand,

05:49.040 --> 05:53.720
it's kind of not so unexpected now
when we have just talked about it.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.280
Fine, forget it!

05:56.840 --> 06:00.240
Let's just have sex exactly the same way
until we die then.

06:32.680 --> 06:34.720
What the fuck Janne, not now!

07:03.040 --> 07:05.320
I said I would fix it.

07:05.840 --> 07:06.960
So why haven't you?

07:07.280 --> 07:08.720
Do you even know what you're doing?

07:08.800 --> 07:09.840
How hard can it be?

07:09.920 --> 07:12.880
Why can't you let me do things
at my own pace?

07:12.960 --> 07:17.160
Ok, Janne. Because this box
is kind of important for our survival.

07:17.240 --> 07:20.520
And you choose to lay around on the couch
and wank off instead.

07:21.440 --> 07:24.280
I think you've been a bit of a downer
the last few days.

07:24.360 --> 07:25.960
What do you mean, downer?

07:26.040 --> 07:27.080
Why are you so grumpy?

07:27.160 --> 07:29.120
It's not about being grumpy.

07:29.400 --> 07:30.600
What is it then?

07:31.640 --> 07:36.200
It's about how you are so happy-go-lucky
all the time in this shit.

07:36.520 --> 07:38.760
Gnawing on the same potatoes,

07:38.840 --> 07:42.520
drinking home-brew,
playing Street Fighter and going to bed.

07:42.920 --> 07:43.960
Shit, then?

07:44.280 --> 07:45.400
What?

07:45.480 --> 07:47.000
You said "this shit".

07:47.080 --> 07:48.440
That you think everything we have is shit.

07:49.360 --> 07:50.600
It can't be much of a surprise

07:50.680 --> 07:53.200
that this isn't exactly
the Four Seasons on the Maldives.

07:53.280 --> 07:55.520
Good, now I know how you feel.

07:56.280 --> 07:57.280
"Boohoo,

07:57.360 --> 08:01.000
my name is Janne and I'm going to
nail myself up on a cross now!"

08:02.440 --> 08:03.880
I'm not even going to respond to that.

08:03.960 --> 08:08.320
We promised each other
never to fight in front of Alice

08:09.360 --> 08:11.320
and I, at least, am going to respect that!

09:13.120 --> 09:14.520
I want a divorce.

09:16.040 --> 09:17.120
What?

09:17.200 --> 09:20.000
I think it would be best for us both.

09:20.840 --> 09:23.920
-Is this because of that goddamn cord?
-No.

09:24.600 --> 09:25.880
Because if it's about that fucking cord

09:25.960 --> 09:28.040
then I think
you're being fucking ridiculous, actually.

09:28.120 --> 09:29.240
Yeah, but it's not that.

09:29.320 --> 09:30.880
Are you serious?

09:31.240 --> 09:32.280
Yes.

09:32.640 --> 09:35.960
I might very well be the last man
in the whole world

09:36.040 --> 09:37.760
and you want to divorce me.
Did I get that right, then?

09:37.840 --> 09:40.480
But why do you have to take it that way?

09:40.840 --> 09:42.920
Yeah, how the hell should I take it?

09:43.480 --> 09:45.520
It's a pretty fat dumping,
wouldn't you say?

09:45.600 --> 09:47.440
Ok, we'll talk more about it later.

09:49.240 --> 09:50.720
For fuck's sake, Marie.

09:51.040 --> 09:52.400
For fuck's sake!

09:55.080 --> 09:56.400
That hurt.

10:00.240 --> 10:03.160
Darling, don't think this is your fault.

10:03.560 --> 10:06.440
Me and Daddy love you as much as ever

10:08.440 --> 10:09.680
It's just that...

10:11.840 --> 10:15.280
when a mommy has lived a very,
very long time with a daddy.

10:16.560 --> 10:20.280
And a daddy has
a somewhat special personality

10:20.360 --> 10:23.280
and a mommy has
a completely different personality.

10:24.200 --> 10:28.400
Then the mommy can become
a little tired of the daddy.

10:30.840 --> 10:32.080
Do you understand?

10:33.200 --> 10:36.280
And I think all three of us
will be happier from this.

10:54.800 --> 10:57.840
So how do you think
this divorce will work?

10:59.200 --> 11:02.000
You take the house, I take the car.

11:02.080 --> 11:04.960
OK, and where are you thinking
of driving the car then?

11:05.240 --> 11:06.400
Yeah, not that it's any of your business,

11:06.480 --> 11:08.840
but I thought of seeing
if there's someone else out there.

11:09.760 --> 11:13.920
Someone you can have sex with
in unexpected places maybe?

11:16.040 --> 11:16.920
Here, read.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.280
Dear Bertil,

11:21.600 --> 11:25.880
I hope you're well.
Here in Torekov there are no zombies.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.120
We cook out and go swimming
just like normal.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.960
Won't you drive here?

11:31.360 --> 11:33.480
We're so worried for you.

11:33.760 --> 11:34.640
And?

11:34.720 --> 11:37.720
This is exactly why you and I
can't be together.

11:37.800 --> 11:40.120
Aha, because I am a realist
and make sure we survive?

11:40.680 --> 11:43.320
Because you are so fucking short-sighted,
Janne!

11:43.400 --> 11:44.960
You wouldn't leave the yard

11:45.040 --> 11:48.520
if the ice-cream truck
stood right outside!

11:50.280 --> 11:52.880
Fuck! I told you you didn't know
how to fix it.

11:52.960 --> 11:54.280
But at least I did something.

12:02.280 --> 12:03.480
Let's go.

12:20.600 --> 12:23.240
Why should you take the car,
by the way? It's mine.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.240
You don't even like to drive.

12:25.320 --> 12:28.200
"Oh, no, I can't parallel park
if people are watching."

12:28.680 --> 12:30.720
Damn,
it'll be nice to be divorced from you.

12:31.040 --> 12:33.440
Oh, how I'm going to celebrate!

12:33.760 --> 12:36.160
Are you going to jerk off behind
the currant bushes like you usually do?

12:37.360 --> 12:38.240
Yep, maybe I will.

12:38.760 --> 12:40.280
And maybe I'll listen

12:40.360 --> 12:43.960
to the story of when you and Katherine
were in India for the thousandth time.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.800
No, that's right,
I don't have to anymore!

12:46.880 --> 12:48.840
I get the good china.

12:48.920 --> 12:51.240
Sure, it's so fucking ugly anyway!

12:52.240 --> 12:53.760
Better than
the fucking pretentious glasses

12:53.840 --> 12:55.560
we got from your mom in any case.

12:55.760 --> 12:59.560
Sorry that my mom wasn't born
with a silver spoon in her ass

12:59.640 --> 13:01.760
like your fucking Nazi parents.

13:01.840 --> 13:03.960
You understand that this is why
we're getting divorced, right?

13:04.040 --> 13:06.520
Because you are so fucking mean
all the time.

13:06.880 --> 13:09.120
Oh, and you, leaving your own daughter.

13:09.200 --> 13:10.360
She isn't our daughter anymore.

13:10.440 --> 13:13.320
She hasn't been for several years
and she won't ever be again!

13:26.680 --> 13:28.520
Damn it. I know everything here is shit.

13:29.760 --> 13:31.000
I do know it.

13:33.840 --> 13:37.040
Not only shit.
It's been nice sometimes too.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.400
It's a fucking nightmare, all of it.

13:42.240 --> 13:44.080
But we've managed okay.

13:45.640 --> 13:48.560
It's just as well
that we stop playing family now.

13:48.640 --> 13:50.200
Of course you should leave.

13:51.520 --> 13:53.600
You've always been too cool for me.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.680
No, that's not true.

13:55.880 --> 13:58.440
I would have died a long time ago
if not for you.

13:58.520 --> 13:59.880
Zombies or not.

14:03.920 --> 14:06.760
By the way, I have a...

14:06.840 --> 14:08.600
farewell present for you.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.480
It's a lungo!

14:14.000 --> 14:17.720
It's that Ethiopian blend
you liked so much,

14:17.800 --> 14:20.480
that tastes like cinnamon rolls.

14:20.960 --> 14:23.200
How did you get it?

14:23.280 --> 14:26.240
I found it between
the slats in the wardrobe.

14:26.320 --> 14:28.880
It was actually your birthday present,
but...

14:29.360 --> 14:32.200
-We'll split it.
-No, no!

14:33.280 --> 14:35.160
I want you to drink it.

14:35.880 --> 14:38.960
You should drink it
when you start your new life.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.120
Thanks.

14:56.360 --> 14:57.880
Why haven't you packed?

14:58.600 --> 15:00.200
Oh, there's no hurry.

15:00.280 --> 15:02.200
I thought I'd make
a little breakfast first.

15:04.080 --> 15:05.320
How nice.

15:06.480 --> 15:08.560
Should we go out
and say good morning to Alice?
