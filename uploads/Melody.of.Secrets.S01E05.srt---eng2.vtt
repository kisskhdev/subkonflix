WEBVTT

00:00:00.105 --> 00:00:00.729
You meant to–

00:00:00.753 --> 00:00:01.825
I just love you.

00:00:01.857 --> 00:00:03.553
You’re my best friend.

00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:04.873
And that will never change.

00:00:04.913 --> 00:00:07.073
What I did was disgusting.

00:00:07.295 --> 00:00:10.017
If it’s disgusting, then both of us are disgusting.

00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:44.145
Yes?

00:00:44.415 --> 00:00:46.497
I’ve checked the CCTV as you asked

00:00:47.085 --> 00:00:49.689
and got the bike that ran you over in it.

00:00:50.215 --> 00:00:51.385
(Already forwarded to you.)

00:00:51.415 --> 00:00:52.415
(You can check it out.)

00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:53.441
Okay.

00:01:09.845 --> 00:01:10.881
(You’ve seen it, right?)

00:01:11.675 --> 00:01:12.675
(Yeah.)

00:01:12.725 --> 00:01:14.481
You’re with Botpleng now, right?

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:16.175
(If yes, )

00:01:17.255 --> 00:01:18.473
(don’t say anything.)

00:01:19.285 --> 00:01:20.665
(Don’t let him know)

00:01:21.945 --> 00:01:23.945
(that you know that guy is Tanu)

00:01:24.375 --> 00:01:27.689
(who used to work for Khitakarn, his mom.)

00:02:23.841 --> 00:02:25.273
Thanks for the ride.

00:02:33.705 --> 00:02:34.889
Are you not going in with me?

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:40.085
Inspector Dao pretended not to know

00:02:40.565 --> 00:02:42.001
about me pretending to be Thunphob

00:02:42.965 --> 00:02:44.201
out of my request.

00:02:46.435 --> 00:02:48.097
The one who should feel most guilty

00:02:48.897 --> 00:02:50.895
should be me, who tricked you.

00:02:55.045 --> 00:02:56.489
That’s not what it is, Tankhun.

00:02:57.945 --> 00:03:00.465
It’s not that I don’t want to meet
Inspector Dao because of you.

00:03:03.135 --> 00:03:04.497
I’m just afraid.

00:03:09.225 --> 00:03:11.105
I’m afraid that the more the truth is unveiled,

00:03:11.325 --> 00:03:15.649
there would be more things
that make me regret what I’m doing now.

00:03:28.945 --> 00:03:30.065
You should get going.

00:03:30.777 --> 00:03:32.775
I should head to the office now.

00:03:43.625 --> 00:03:44.241
SUSPECT.
VICTIM.

00:03:44.273 --> 00:03:46.245
The first victim of the murder was found

00:03:46.595 --> 00:03:49.961
where Botpleng asked you to meet.

00:03:52.255 --> 00:03:53.593
As for the second case,

00:03:54.085 --> 00:03:56.121
there’s a relation in the means of murder

00:03:56.161 --> 00:03:57.681
and the weapon used.

00:03:58.925 --> 00:04:00.273
The latest one.

00:04:03.817 --> 00:04:05.345
Your assault case.

00:04:07.257 --> 00:04:08.841
I’ve looked into it and found that

00:04:08.865 --> 00:04:10.553
the attacker was Tanu

00:04:10.593 --> 00:04:12.801
who used to work for Khitakan,
Botpleng’s mom.

00:04:15.745 --> 00:04:19.065
You’re saying that the link between the cases

00:04:19.585 --> 00:04:21.025
is that they’re related to Botpleng?

00:04:21.925 --> 00:04:23.497
I wouldn’t think so

00:04:23.965 --> 00:04:26.441
if I hadn’t found additional information

00:04:26.473 --> 00:04:29.777
that the second victim was a clerk
when Botpleng’s dad was a sheriff.

00:04:39.273 --> 00:04:42.073
Not to mention Thunphob, Botpleng’s lover.

00:04:42.105 --> 00:04:42.993
That’s enough.

00:04:43.017 --> 00:04:45.505
SUSPECT.

00:04:45.545 --> 00:04:46.849
If you were to suspect.

00:04:48.865 --> 00:04:50.617
VICTIM.

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:52.615
You should be suspecting that
Botpleng’s a victim.

00:04:54.433 --> 00:04:56.435
I saw Tanu attacking Pleng.

00:04:58.765 --> 00:05:01.281
Are there any other reasons
for you to protect him?

00:05:02.365 --> 00:05:05.177
Botpleng is your brother’s lover

00:05:05.875 --> 00:05:07.273
not yours, isn’t that right?

00:05:12.875 --> 00:05:14.475
Where did you get your scholarship from?

00:05:16.465 --> 00:05:19.273
When we studied criminal behavior analysis
in the UK,

00:05:20.855 --> 00:05:21.993
where we met.

00:05:22.705 --> 00:05:25.025
The scholarship grantee would be so upset

00:05:25.057 --> 00:05:27.025
if you’ve forgotten something so basic.

00:05:29.445 --> 00:05:30.537
Tell me,

00:05:30.995 --> 00:05:33.673
why would Tanu,
who could kill so cold-bloodedly

00:05:33.713 --> 00:05:35.793
and so organized in his murder

00:05:35.833 --> 00:05:37.137
would do something so reckless

00:05:37.165 --> 00:05:40.009
like attacking Botpleng and me

00:05:40.033 --> 00:05:41.625
and got caught by the camera?

00:05:44.435 --> 00:05:45.435
Well.

00:05:45.685 --> 00:05:46.761
It’s DID.

00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:51.673
You still fail to pass the second test.

00:05:52.335 --> 00:05:53.681
Wanting to win so much

00:05:54.805 --> 00:05:57.961
that you leave the citizen in danger.

00:05:58.965 --> 00:06:00.801
Even if Tanu really had DID,

00:06:01.525 --> 00:06:03.265
it doesn’t provide the answer that.

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:05.601
Botpleng’s family is behind this

00:06:05.641 --> 00:06:08.329
and that Botpleng wouldn’t be in danger.

00:06:09.445 --> 00:06:11.713
You didn’t let me tell Botpleng about Tanu.

00:06:12.325 --> 00:06:13.993
Can you still remember what you said?

00:06:15.315 --> 00:06:17.913
If Botpleng is in danger,

00:06:18.365 --> 00:06:21.017
will you be able to handle the responsibility?

00:06:26.235 --> 00:06:29.817
But I won’t let Botpleng be in danger.

00:06:49.445 --> 00:06:51.265
If this is what you need to know.

00:06:51.297 --> 00:06:53.817
(If Botpleng is in danger, )

00:06:54.345 --> 00:06:56.497
(will you be able to handle the responsibility?)

00:06:56.785 --> 00:06:59.889
(But I won’t let Botpleng be in danger.)

00:07:00.995 --> 00:07:04.889
I have both you and Tankhun
who care about me.

00:07:05.965 --> 00:07:07.673
Are you really okay?

00:07:12.355 --> 00:07:13.355
I don’t know.

00:07:15.465 --> 00:07:17.793
I’ve been looking for my first love for so long

00:07:20.095 --> 00:07:21.505
just to find out that.

00:07:23.085 --> 00:07:24.961
I’ve fallen for this brother.

00:07:28.905 --> 00:07:30.769
While the first love I’ve been looking for

00:07:33.201 --> 00:07:35.205
died while he was looking for me.

00:07:39.655 --> 00:07:41.353
I just want to be happy.

00:07:44.405 --> 00:07:47.641
I want to be as happy
as my current memory allows.

00:07:50.215 --> 00:07:51.369
Because I don’t know

00:07:51.865 --> 00:07:53.865
what the memory that’s about to return

00:07:54.361 --> 00:07:55.865
will bring to me.

00:08:29.655 --> 00:08:30.655
Why are you following me?

00:10:20.785 --> 00:10:21.785
Are you okay?

00:10:29.473 --> 00:10:29.929
Hey!

00:10:29.953 --> 00:10:30.953
Pleng!

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:32.965
Are you okay?

00:10:34.365 --> 00:10:35.365
I’m okay.

00:10:48.015 --> 00:10:49.257
Are you okay?

00:10:50.115 --> 00:10:51.209
The cut didn’t hurt.

00:10:51.915 --> 00:10:53.473
The tetanus shot hurts more.

00:10:53.925 --> 00:10:55.625
Don’t wander around alone next time.

00:10:57.801 --> 00:10:58.801
It’s so…

00:11:00.255 --> 00:11:03.169
dangerous out there these days, isn’t it?

00:11:18.815 --> 00:11:20.257
You can send it to me.

00:11:23.175 --> 00:11:24.175
Okay.

00:11:24.345 --> 00:11:26.857
(If Botpleng is in danger, )

00:11:27.345 --> 00:11:29.745
(will you be able to handle the responsibility?)

00:11:29.769 --> 00:11:33.057
(But I won’t let Botpleng be in danger.)

00:11:39.185 --> 00:11:40.713
I can put charges on you.

00:11:42.275 --> 00:11:43.275
Go ahead.

00:11:46.595 --> 00:11:48.377
You knew I wouldn’t dare do it.

00:11:49.785 --> 00:11:51.217
That’s not it, Tankhun.

00:11:52.525 --> 00:11:55.257
I did it because of Muenmile.

00:11:57.205 --> 00:11:59.121
If I didn’t trust you,

00:12:00.215 --> 00:12:02.313
we wouldn’t have come this far.

00:12:04.241 --> 00:12:05.241
One more thing,

00:12:05.765 --> 00:12:07.937
you’re even the brother of my lover.

00:12:13.205 --> 00:12:16.449
But Muen is also someone important to me.

00:12:18.801 --> 00:12:20.785
Ever since my mother fell into a coma,

00:12:21.085 --> 00:12:23.329
there was only he who stayed beside me.

00:12:24.515 --> 00:12:25.961
Being my only friend.

00:12:27.565 --> 00:12:28.649
I just…

00:12:31.425 --> 00:12:33.209
I just have enough confidence in you

00:12:34.545 --> 00:12:36.545
to prove to my friend that.

00:12:38.105 --> 00:12:39.513
I’ve trusted the right person.

00:12:49.725 --> 00:12:51.329
You really knew I wouldn’t dare do it.

00:13:00.235 --> 00:13:02.033
When you met Tanu last time

00:13:02.065 --> 00:13:03.825
you had a panic attack, too, right?

00:13:05.825 --> 00:13:06.825
Yes.

00:13:07.585 --> 00:13:09.049
Any other symptoms?

00:13:13.225 --> 00:13:14.225
I was afraid.

00:13:16.905 --> 00:13:18.617
But it was controllable

00:13:18.925 --> 00:13:20.193
unlike the first time.

00:13:21.125 --> 00:13:22.125
Afraid?

00:13:26.345 --> 00:13:27.345
But…

00:13:27.865 --> 00:13:29.865
I wasn’t afraid that he would attack me.

00:13:31.695 --> 00:13:34.665
It was fear that came from my gut.

00:13:38.935 --> 00:13:40.025
It was like…

00:13:41.385 --> 00:13:43.225
It wasn’t the first time I’ve seen him.

00:13:47.097 --> 00:13:48.649
You’ve met Tanu before?

00:13:56.725 --> 00:13:57.793
I can’t remember.

00:14:02.745 --> 00:14:05.273
I don’t know or believe I’ve ever met

00:14:05.721 --> 00:14:07.725
both the person in the picture and you.

00:14:08.375 --> 00:14:11.289
The police said he used to work for Mom

00:14:11.721 --> 00:14:13.137
so I thought you could know him.

00:14:13.525 --> 00:14:15.241
That means you’re investigating something

00:14:15.289 --> 00:14:17.793
that involves my family?

00:14:18.095 --> 00:14:19.145
There’s nothing much.

00:14:19.765 --> 00:14:22.809
He’s just a suspect in a normal crime case.

00:14:22.833 --> 00:14:24.805
We just want some additional information.

00:14:26.715 --> 00:14:28.553
But you’re not a police officer, aren’t you?

00:14:31.315 --> 00:14:33.185
Though my husband passed away,

00:14:33.417 --> 00:14:37.841
our family still has disciples
and those who work closely with us.

00:14:37.885 --> 00:14:40.625
I don’t like people doing things
that are not their jobs

00:14:40.649 --> 00:14:43.073
and use the name of the police
just to ruin their reputation.

00:14:46.295 --> 00:14:47.505
My apologies.

00:14:48.485 --> 00:14:51.953
I just happened to be investigating
how Thunphob,

00:14:53.145 --> 00:14:56.697
Botpleng’s lover and my brother, had died.

00:14:57.925 --> 00:14:59.377
So I asked him to bring me to you.

00:15:00.849 --> 00:15:02.897
My real question is

00:15:04.305 --> 00:15:07.297
do you know Thunphob?

00:15:08.875 --> 00:15:10.441
I have no obligations

00:15:10.473 --> 00:15:12.081
to answer this question.

00:15:15.325 --> 00:15:17.545
Send your lover’s brother on his way.

00:15:18.125 --> 00:15:19.665
Don’t forget your doctor’s appointment.

00:15:19.689 --> 00:15:21.009
Don’t make me remind you.

00:15:25.755 --> 00:15:27.673
You really knew my lover.

00:15:30.325 --> 00:15:32.801
Why didn’t you or Mom mention him before?

00:15:32.833 --> 00:15:34.001
Even you can’t remember

00:15:34.041 --> 00:15:35.625
who would fancy helping you remember?

00:15:43.097 --> 00:15:45.095
Grandma was really hiding Thunphob from me.

00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:48.697
But your grandma wasn’t lying.

00:15:50.975 --> 00:15:52.377
Both about not knowing Tanu

00:15:53.335 --> 00:15:54.577
and about Thunphob.

00:15:54.885 --> 00:15:55.889
So that means

00:15:56.285 --> 00:15:58.105
my family is really not involved in this.

00:15:58.161 --> 00:16:02.489
Or your grandma was lying flawlessly.

00:16:05.975 --> 00:16:07.617
I thought you would take my side.

00:16:08.515 --> 00:16:10.355
The way you did when talking to Inspector Dao.

00:16:10.675 --> 00:16:13.361
A human’s heart is beyond fathom.

00:16:13.985 --> 00:16:16.665
Just one behavior can’t tell everything.

00:16:17.155 --> 00:16:19.041
I’m just trying to read into all the conflicts

00:16:19.073 --> 00:16:20.369
and all the possibilities.

00:16:22.615 --> 00:16:24.121
If you say so,

00:16:24.153 --> 00:16:25.793
then you must think my family’s involved.

00:16:26.255 --> 00:16:28.033
Aren’t you afraid I’d kill you in the woods?

00:16:28.545 --> 00:16:29.777
I’m saying this

00:16:30.265 --> 00:16:31.593
because I care about you.

00:16:32.405 --> 00:16:35.969
Your grandma looks so unkind to you
that it worries me.

00:16:36.625 --> 00:16:38.625
If you’re wondering
whether Grandma could hurt me,

00:16:40.485 --> 00:16:43.657
I would say she could, without Mom.

00:16:44.455 --> 00:16:45.793
Grandma loves Mom dearly

00:16:46.495 --> 00:16:47.793
that it extended to me.

00:16:50.257 --> 00:16:52.169
Though we never talk nicely,

00:16:52.895 --> 00:16:55.241
she always cares about my treatment.

00:16:57.725 --> 00:16:58.929
The doctor you mean is…

00:16:59.815 --> 00:17:00.849
A psychiatrist.

00:17:02.495 --> 00:17:04.585
Grandma wants me to get my memory back quickly.

00:17:15.705 --> 00:17:17.105
I need your help.

00:17:24.633 --> 00:17:25.817
Are you back already, Mom?

00:17:26.255 --> 00:17:27.255
Mom!

00:17:40.915 --> 00:17:42.481
If you’re feeling alright,

00:17:42.505 --> 00:17:45.641
slowly tell me what you saw in your dream.

00:17:47.865 --> 00:17:49.569
It seemed so real this time.

00:17:52.475 --> 00:17:53.475
It was…

00:17:55.161 --> 00:17:57.165
It was like it’s my memory.

00:17:59.065 --> 00:18:00.553
It didn’t seem like a dream.

00:18:04.849 --> 00:18:06.825
I was in a small, old house.

00:18:08.825 --> 00:18:11.497
I was lighting up a charcoal stove.

00:18:13.165 --> 00:18:14.165
And…

00:18:16.425 --> 00:18:17.425
Mom.

00:18:19.975 --> 00:18:22.665
Didn’t seem like her, but she was walking in.

00:18:23.325 --> 00:18:25.209
It could be a lucid dream.

00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:27.417
A dream when you’re conscious,

00:18:27.441 --> 00:18:29.057
but it feels so real.

00:18:29.565 --> 00:18:31.433
You had a memory loss

00:18:31.473 --> 00:18:33.193
so you might get confused.

00:18:34.321 --> 00:18:36.325
Theoretically speaking,

00:18:36.345 --> 00:18:40.225
this kind of dream will lower your sleeping quality

00:18:40.257 --> 00:18:43.113
and could be dangerous in the long run.

00:18:43.645 --> 00:18:46.689
Then, I’ll give you some prescriptions.

00:18:47.617 --> 00:18:48.617
Yes.

00:19:09.915 --> 00:19:13.569
It seems like Mr. Pleng’s memory
is coming back.

00:19:13.593 --> 00:19:14.593
Is that so?

00:19:15.775 --> 00:19:19.441
Botpleng’s memory should be returning after all.

00:19:57.445 --> 00:19:58.445
Boss!

00:19:58.635 --> 00:19:59.433
What is it?

00:19:59.481 --> 00:20:01.435
Someone asked to see you.

00:20:02.273 --> 00:20:03.273
Who is it?

00:20:05.513 --> 00:20:06.665
Hello.

00:20:06.865 --> 00:20:08.489
I’m here to interview you.

00:20:19.281 --> 00:20:21.041
I brought you some centella juice.

00:20:28.065 --> 00:20:29.337
It’s pretty hard to find.

00:20:30.255 --> 00:20:33.425
Is there any subtext in giving me this?

00:20:33.945 --> 00:20:35.393
Just testing out the water.

00:20:35.425 --> 00:20:37.395
See how you’re healing after a heartbreak.

00:20:39.257 --> 00:20:40.705
Just say what you have to say.

00:20:42.441 --> 00:20:44.345
Tan couldn’t contact Botpleng.

00:20:44.905 --> 00:20:46.441
He wanted to come himself

00:20:46.815 --> 00:20:48.241
but he sent me because he knew

00:20:48.697 --> 00:20:50.695
that you won’t do anything.

00:20:50.881 --> 00:20:52.885
I’m not the type to attack anyone.

00:20:53.835 --> 00:20:56.801
Also, Pleng and I are done.

00:20:57.285 --> 00:20:59.409
We - are - friends.

00:21:00.635 --> 00:21:03.681
Then you can tell us where Botpleng is.

00:21:05.217 --> 00:21:06.217
No.

00:21:08.055 --> 00:21:09.201
Nothing to it, though.

00:21:09.825 --> 00:21:11.425
The reason I look confused

00:21:11.905 --> 00:21:14.481
is because I thought Pleng
was with your brother.

00:21:14.885 --> 00:21:16.881
I couldn’t contact him for 2 days now.

00:21:24.095 --> 00:21:25.593
Are you really going to do this, Tan?

00:21:25.625 --> 00:21:26.625
Yeah.

00:21:27.165 --> 00:21:28.345
There’s no other way.

00:22:10.915 --> 00:22:11.915
Pleng.

00:22:12.365 --> 00:22:13.365
Pleng.

00:22:17.675 --> 00:22:18.675
Who?

00:22:30.145 --> 00:22:32.465
(Then you took him out of the house so easily?)

00:22:33.095 --> 00:22:34.441
(There was barely anyone there.)

00:22:34.975 --> 00:22:35.975
(Isn’t that strange?)

00:22:36.055 --> 00:22:38.873
(I only know that Pleng’s Grandma
doesn’t want anyone in her house.)

00:22:38.913 --> 00:22:40.649
(I didn’t know she would go this far.)

00:22:40.665 --> 00:22:42.233
(There’s no one on guard.)

00:22:42.775 --> 00:22:43.825
(The other day, when I was on a lookout, )

00:22:43.849 --> 00:22:45.385
(I saw some housekeepers)

00:22:45.425 --> 00:22:47.465
(and a nurse who came and left on the same day.)

00:22:47.505 --> 00:22:48.625
(I was surprised too.)

00:22:50.849 --> 00:22:51.849
Pleng.

00:22:53.713 --> 00:22:54.793
Are you awake now?

00:22:55.055 --> 00:22:56.055
How are you feeling?

00:22:58.681 --> 00:23:00.685
You keep making that dumbfounded face.

00:23:00.729 --> 00:23:01.977
Can you remember me?

00:23:03.545 --> 00:23:04.897
What the hell are you doing here?

00:23:09.925 --> 00:23:10.925
And…

00:23:12.645 --> 00:23:14.089
What happened to me last night?

00:23:17.655 --> 00:23:19.201
Why do I feel so confused?

00:23:20.675 --> 00:23:23.769
Um… let me do some initial testing.

00:23:37.375 --> 00:23:39.025
Everything’s normal now.

00:23:39.355 --> 00:23:41.281
Pleng said he’s just going to call his grandma

00:23:41.329 --> 00:23:42.945
just to prevent any trouble.

00:23:43.605 --> 00:23:44.605
Normal?

00:23:46.195 --> 00:23:47.195
Really?

00:23:47.555 --> 00:23:49.841
Why does he seem like he can’t remember
his conversation with me?

00:23:49.865 --> 00:23:52.881
The human brain has a complex structure.

00:23:52.929 --> 00:23:56.297
Pleng lost his memory in an accident
many years ago.

00:23:56.313 --> 00:23:59.905
That could leave a chronic illness

00:23:59.937 --> 00:24:03.073
or other factors that prevent the memory from returning.

00:24:03.445 --> 00:24:06.065
Normally, a human brain might work 100%

00:24:06.105 --> 00:24:08.865
but Pleng’s brain might only work at 80%.

00:24:08.905 --> 00:24:10.801
Then, when he lacks sleep

00:24:10.833 --> 00:24:12.713
or when other things are affecting him,

00:24:12.745 --> 00:24:16.049
it could cause a temporary symptom too.

00:24:16.895 --> 00:24:18.729
The forgetting things part might be normal

00:24:19.685 --> 00:24:22.873
but going unavailable doesn’t seem normal.

00:24:24.715 --> 00:24:26.473
Grandma wanted me to go live abroad

00:24:26.521 --> 00:24:28.689
but I refused, so we fought.

00:24:32.755 --> 00:24:33.755
Then…

00:24:35.355 --> 00:24:37.177
I took some pills to help me sleep

00:24:39.445 --> 00:24:41.209
then I was slipping in and out of sleep

00:24:43.985 --> 00:24:45.985
and dreamt about things when I was young.

00:24:47.405 --> 00:24:48.961
Slipping in and out of sleep?

00:24:49.953 --> 00:24:51.955
Can you remember when you were awake?

00:24:54.345 --> 00:24:55.497
I can’t.

00:24:56.195 --> 00:25:01.089
I knew I was awake, but it was always blurry.

00:25:02.445 --> 00:25:04.481
What kind of pill did you take?

00:25:06.075 --> 00:25:07.075
I don’t know.

00:25:07.745 --> 00:25:09.377
I only know it made me very sleepy.

00:25:09.995 --> 00:25:11.521
Did you see the doctor?

00:25:12.455 --> 00:25:13.489
I didn’t.

00:25:14.433 --> 00:25:16.435
Are you suspecting something, Jen?

00:25:17.725 --> 00:25:20.969
It seems like part of a hypnotizing process.

00:25:21.805 --> 00:25:25.873
Some use it to bring back memories.

00:25:26.065 --> 00:25:27.521
To help you bring back your memory.

00:25:28.615 --> 00:25:30.497
If she really wanted me to remember things,

00:25:32.195 --> 00:25:34.537
why did she not tell me anything
about the house in Korat?

00:25:37.985 --> 00:25:39.777
She never took me there

00:25:40.625 --> 00:25:42.001
and didn’t even let me go there.

00:25:45.665 --> 00:25:46.753
You’re right.

00:25:47.721 --> 00:25:49.725
It really seems conflicting.

00:25:50.945 --> 00:25:53.017
If she really wants you to remember things,

00:25:54.473 --> 00:25:56.833
why was she trying to stop you
from thinking about the past?

00:25:57.005 --> 00:25:59.737
So what were you seeing the doctor for?

00:26:06.273 --> 00:26:08.275
What if it wasn’t for you to remember things

00:26:08.745 --> 00:26:10.473
but for you to forget certain events?

00:26:14.475 --> 00:26:17.433
Jen, is this possible?

00:26:18.245 --> 00:26:19.289
It is.

00:26:21.405 --> 00:26:24.233
Even making you forget the triggering factor,

00:26:25.769 --> 00:26:27.765
that missing memory,

00:26:28.801 --> 00:26:30.805
how important could it have been?

00:26:57.495 --> 00:26:58.615
What are you thinking about?

00:27:06.353 --> 00:27:08.209
About the missing memories.

00:27:10.905 --> 00:27:12.073
I’m curious.

00:27:13.641 --> 00:27:15.393
What kind of memories was it?

00:27:17.809 --> 00:27:19.805
Why does no one want me to remember it?

00:27:23.685 --> 00:27:24.729
Can you believe it?

00:27:27.235 --> 00:27:29.393
Before Mom fell into a coma,

00:27:31.945 --> 00:27:33.649
I was so happy.

00:27:36.875 --> 00:27:38.473
Mom used to say

00:27:40.825 --> 00:27:42.825
it’s okay for me not to remember anything.

00:27:46.455 --> 00:27:47.897
I only realized it now

00:27:51.085 --> 00:27:52.889
that she never wanted me to remember.

00:27:55.985 --> 00:27:57.313
If Thunphob were here.

00:27:59.525 --> 00:28:01.281
I think he would want you to remember.

00:28:06.241 --> 00:28:07.281
What about you?

00:28:09.945 --> 00:28:11.529
Do you want me to remember?

00:28:12.535 --> 00:28:13.889
The me now

00:28:16.715 --> 00:28:18.081
is probably the same as your mom.

00:28:27.625 --> 00:28:30.993
If it hurts so much that you need to forget,

00:28:32.205 --> 00:28:33.205
then I

00:28:34.425 --> 00:28:36.073
don’t want you to remember it.

00:29:15.185 --> 00:29:16.225
Yes, Inspector?

00:29:17.465 --> 00:29:21.673
(I found the link between the serial murders
and Thunphob’s case.)

00:29:29.725 --> 00:29:32.697
I’m fine with you protecting your brother’s lover

00:29:33.005 --> 00:29:35.825
but bringing him along to listen to all this information,

00:29:35.857 --> 00:29:37.089
I think it’s too far.

00:29:37.395 --> 00:29:39.121
It’s wrong, Tankhun.

00:29:42.195 --> 00:29:45.425
I promise I won’t tell anyone.

00:29:46.245 --> 00:29:49.937
Also, I’m not here today as a journalist.

00:29:50.985 --> 00:29:53.145
I’m here today as someone who’s involved in this case.

00:29:54.685 --> 00:29:55.689
I know

00:29:56.801 --> 00:29:59.001
that all the cases involve me as the link between them.

00:30:01.375 --> 00:30:03.617
I want nothing but the truth.

00:30:03.657 --> 00:30:06.737
Even if it has to be squeezed out from
the truth everyone wanted me to forget,

00:30:07.025 --> 00:30:08.025
I will do it.

00:30:11.565 --> 00:30:13.833
Then if there’s anything wrong with this case,

00:30:14.985 --> 00:30:16.865
you can go and bear the shame

00:30:16.905 --> 00:30:19.441
along with your being the best of the class
all this time.

00:30:30.365 --> 00:30:33.961
The mechanic found this attached to the wheel hub when they detached it.

00:30:35.335 --> 00:30:36.937
After examining it,

00:30:36.969 --> 00:30:40.801
it’s the same as the weapon of murder in
the first and second cases.

00:30:43.075 --> 00:30:44.641
So can we now conclude

00:30:45.185 --> 00:30:46.897
that the murderer has DID

00:30:47.795 --> 00:30:49.809
and the prime suspect is Tanu?

00:30:51.095 --> 00:30:55.465
Or the behavior might not have been conflicting.

00:30:58.565 --> 00:30:59.705
Leave.

00:30:59.965 --> 00:31:01.297
Unless you want to die.

00:31:03.681 --> 00:31:04.681
Are you okay?

00:31:05.205 --> 00:31:06.833
Because Tanu never hurt me.

00:31:08.755 --> 00:31:11.593
Even when he got a chance, he didn’t do it.

00:31:14.155 --> 00:31:19.737
Tanu is the suspect in Thunphob’s case
and the other two cases.

00:31:20.385 --> 00:31:23.457
All of them are part of Botpleng’s family.

00:31:25.085 --> 00:31:28.417
Tanu doesn’t harm Botpleng

00:31:28.965 --> 00:31:30.561
but also doesn’t want him involved.

00:31:32.325 --> 00:31:34.625
This resonates with what Madame Ked is trying to do.

00:31:35.795 --> 00:31:38.409
Why do they all do that?

00:31:41.705 --> 00:31:43.593
Maybe it’s to protect

00:31:45.449 --> 00:31:47.445
something that’s in your memory.

00:31:48.361 --> 00:31:51.505
Maybe there’s something they didn’t want anyone to know.

00:31:54.845 --> 00:31:56.865
If we could access that secret

00:31:57.415 --> 00:32:01.985
maybe we don’t have to force Pleng to remember.

00:32:04.545 --> 00:32:07.281
Then you’re lucky, Tankhun.

00:32:08.795 --> 00:32:12.321
FILE
WIND POWER CONCESSION.

00:32:13.595 --> 00:32:15.225
15 years ago,

00:32:16.085 --> 00:32:18.553
Sheriff Petchkla, Botpleng’s dad

00:32:19.335 --> 00:32:22.001
was reported for fraud in a wind power concession.

00:32:24.005 --> 00:32:27.657
The two victims of the murder cases
were part of the fraud.

00:32:29.045 --> 00:32:31.257
I might be making too complicated a hypothesis here.

00:32:32.635 --> 00:32:34.025
But isn’t it possible?

00:32:34.465 --> 00:32:36.337
That Thunphob could have found that out

00:32:36.353 --> 00:32:37.777
so he was murdered to silence out.

00:32:43.185 --> 00:32:47.385
Surely, the memory of your own family

00:32:47.409 --> 00:32:48.697
killing your lover

00:32:49.705 --> 00:32:52.065
is probably not something
anyone would want you to remember.

00:33:21.845 --> 00:33:22.913
I’ve never thought that one day.

00:33:22.937 --> 00:33:24.905
I’d think I’m lucky to have lost my memory.

00:33:25.765 --> 00:33:27.169
It was just a hypothesis.

00:33:36.765 --> 00:33:38.161
That’s what I’m afraid of.

00:33:39.165 --> 00:33:40.705
I’m afraid it’d be even worse.

00:33:54.545 --> 00:33:55.545
Pleng.

00:33:57.055 --> 00:33:58.433
I agree with your Grandma.

00:33:59.865 --> 00:34:01.289
You should live abroad for a while.

00:34:09.735 --> 00:34:11.977
MADAME KEDSARA.

00:34:12.001 --> 00:34:14.193
Hello, Inspector Darakorn speaking.

00:34:14.515 --> 00:34:15.897
(I’m Kedsara.)

00:34:16.765 --> 00:34:18.105
Do anything to stop the police

00:34:18.145 --> 00:34:21.089
(from digging up the wind power concession case.)

00:34:22.195 --> 00:34:23.217
Yes, Madame.

00:34:43.305 --> 00:34:44.305
Wait up.

00:34:52.745 --> 00:34:54.297
Here. Help me out.

00:34:55.409 --> 00:34:57.405
Do you want me to file it away?

00:34:57.433 --> 00:34:58.809
FILE
WIND POWER CONCESSION.

00:34:58.833 --> 00:34:59.873
File what away?

00:35:00.505 --> 00:35:02.505
I’m going to dig up this case

00:35:03.005 --> 00:35:05.249
and you have to help me gather the information

00:35:05.281 --> 00:35:07.041
so that I can bring it to the superintendent

00:35:07.295 --> 00:35:08.977
then set up a special investigation team.

00:35:09.705 --> 00:35:10.705
Here.

00:35:13.165 --> 00:35:14.165
What’s wrong?

00:35:15.665 --> 00:35:17.665
You’re my idol.

00:35:20.675 --> 00:35:21.675
What?

00:35:22.649 --> 00:35:23.801
I’m right on it!

00:35:35.529 --> 00:35:36.809
Your hair is so soft.

00:35:39.105 --> 00:35:40.801
I always have my hair washed at the salon.

00:35:40.845 --> 00:35:42.177
Whatever they used there,

00:35:42.209 --> 00:35:43.209
That was probably it.

00:35:44.393 --> 00:35:46.395
Then you’d better have it washed at the salon.

00:35:47.915 --> 00:35:50.475
It’s not like your place makes it easy for me
to wash it for you.

00:35:52.085 --> 00:35:53.085
It does.

00:35:53.625 --> 00:35:55.265
Because I have you with me now.

00:35:59.785 --> 00:36:01.137
One more thing,

00:36:01.945 --> 00:36:03.697
I don’t want you to be alone.

00:36:09.185 --> 00:36:10.185
I know now

00:36:11.177 --> 00:36:13.175
why Thunphob wanted to be you so badly.

00:36:15.175 --> 00:36:18.817
Because your heart is so big and warm.

00:36:20.065 --> 00:36:21.977
Are you going to pretend to be me, too?

00:36:22.009 --> 00:36:23.145
I can’t have it anymore.

00:36:24.355 --> 00:36:25.513
No.

00:36:27.925 --> 00:36:29.209
I just want to be in it.

00:36:32.615 --> 00:36:33.735
You’ve always been in there.

00:36:56.405 --> 00:36:57.569
Hey, Tankhun.

00:36:57.593 --> 00:36:58.593
Let’s eat.

00:37:02.645 --> 00:37:04.001
You know how to cook?

00:37:04.725 --> 00:37:06.105
I never knew it either.

00:37:06.485 --> 00:37:07.849
But after I could light up the charcoal stove,

00:37:07.865 --> 00:37:08.945
I wanted to try.

00:37:09.545 --> 00:37:12.633
Turns out I knew how to do it all.

00:37:24.845 --> 00:37:28.273
Thun told me you don’t like vegetables,
just like him.

00:37:29.713 --> 00:37:31.715
He didn’t like it because he hated chewing it.

00:37:32.225 --> 00:37:35.313
While you don’t like it because it’s bitter.

00:37:35.775 --> 00:37:36.775
I don’t know about that.

00:37:38.465 --> 00:37:40.497
I now like both chewing it

00:37:41.885 --> 00:37:42.969
and the taste of it.

00:37:56.745 --> 00:37:57.745
Is there anything?

00:38:08.809 --> 00:38:10.805
I’m memorizing this Botpleng.

00:38:12.275 --> 00:38:13.633
The one who likes vegetables.

00:38:14.455 --> 00:38:15.665
Knows how to light a fire.

00:38:16.815 --> 00:38:18.289
Likes green tea.

00:38:21.305 --> 00:38:23.057
Who couldn’t understand how leaves

00:38:23.569 --> 00:38:24.729
can sound like a melody.

00:38:34.185 --> 00:38:35.393
I’m scared you will forget.

00:38:46.875 --> 00:38:48.065
It’s not bitter at all.

00:38:49.525 --> 00:38:50.633
I definitely won’t forget.

00:39:16.745 --> 00:39:18.945
Why are you writing on it
when it’s about to be removed?

00:39:22.193 --> 00:39:24.689
Because you’re removing it soon.

00:39:25.245 --> 00:39:26.905
If I wrote it from the start

00:39:26.937 --> 00:39:30.257
and the ink seeps into the cast and ruins it,

00:39:30.925 --> 00:39:32.289
your arm could be infected.

00:39:33.725 --> 00:39:34.977
Alright, I got it.

00:39:42.645 --> 00:39:44.353
Mr. Tankhun.

00:39:44.393 --> 00:39:45.481
Please come right this way.

00:39:46.525 --> 00:39:47.525
I’ll be right back.

00:39:52.515 --> 00:39:53.515
Good luck.

00:40:13.137 --> 00:40:14.625
Um, excuse me.

00:40:15.005 --> 00:40:16.765
Could you take a picture of the cast for me?

00:40:17.761 --> 00:40:18.729
Before you remove it,

00:40:18.753 --> 00:40:20.177
I want to see what he has written.

00:40:20.765 --> 00:40:21.765
Sure.

00:40:26.655 --> 00:40:27.655
Here you go.

00:40:27.735 --> 00:40:28.735
Thank you.

00:40:32.765 --> 00:40:34.369
(Good luck.)

00:40:34.393 --> 00:40:35.641
(Love you.)

00:40:36.215 --> 00:40:37.215
(Goodbye.)

00:41:01.165 --> 00:41:03.953
(I don’t want to be everyone’s Botpleng anymore.)

00:41:41.275 --> 00:41:42.275
Put that down.

00:41:53.135 --> 00:41:54.305
That’s twice now.

00:41:56.165 --> 00:41:57.665
That you snuck into my house.

00:42:08.255 --> 00:42:09.255
For you.

00:42:10.235 --> 00:42:11.313
Both times.

00:42:18.485 --> 00:42:20.337
I’ve decided to never see you again.

00:42:23.241 --> 00:42:24.633
Don’t bother me.

00:42:32.295 --> 00:42:33.295
Why?

00:42:54.401 --> 00:42:55.657
Because I’m not him.

00:43:03.985 --> 00:43:05.785
I’m not Botpleng, who likes vegetables.

00:43:09.485 --> 00:43:10.865
Who can light up a fire.

00:43:14.985 --> 00:43:16.153
Who can forget Thunphob

00:43:22.755 --> 00:43:23.993
and love you.

00:43:31.995 --> 00:43:33.995
It’s not just about how we can fall in love.

00:43:37.735 --> 00:43:39.369
But how can I live?

00:43:41.125 --> 00:43:43.705
If I have to hide my true self?

00:43:48.815 --> 00:43:51.473
I can’t even remember
what happened in the past.

00:44:15.305 --> 00:44:16.457
I told you.

00:44:20.925 --> 00:44:22.633
I will make you remember.

00:44:26.665 --> 00:44:29.225
No matter what your memory holds,

00:44:32.205 --> 00:44:33.265
I will be with you.

00:44:40.033 --> 00:44:42.035
What if it were me who killed Thunphob?

00:44:46.475 --> 00:44:48.505
What if it were me who killed your brother?

00:44:52.885 --> 00:44:54.353
What would you do?

00:45:41.225 --> 00:45:43.033
I will hold you like this.

00:45:46.245 --> 00:45:47.505
Whatever you ask.

00:45:49.255 --> 00:45:50.505
I will do it for you.

00:45:59.465 --> 00:46:00.705
If you want to remember,

00:46:03.495 --> 00:46:05.225
I will help you remember.

00:46:07.761 --> 00:46:09.209
Even if you can remember things

00:46:10.725 --> 00:46:12.105
and forget about me,

00:46:16.515 --> 00:46:17.889
I will remember you.

00:46:32.657 --> 00:46:34.033
No matter

00:46:36.005 --> 00:46:37.601
what your memory holds,

00:46:41.005 --> 00:46:42.065
I will love you.

00:46:45.935 --> 00:46:46.985
In the past.

00:46:48.185 --> 00:46:49.265
In the present.

00:46:52.085 --> 00:46:53.085
Or in the future.

00:48:14.915 --> 00:48:16.345
Who are you?

00:48:16.377 --> 00:48:17.945
Where are you?

00:48:18.345 --> 00:48:21.089
Which identity is my true self?

00:48:22.655 --> 00:48:23.655
Pleng!

00:48:23.835 --> 00:48:24.835
I know him.

00:48:24.995 --> 00:48:26.753
I think I love you enough

00:48:26.785 --> 00:48:28.945
for my other identity to realize.

00:48:29.417 --> 00:48:33.673
I will always be the second violin in your Canon in D.

00:48:33.885 --> 00:48:35.257
So I became Botpleng.
