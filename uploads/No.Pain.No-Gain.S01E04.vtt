that Divine General Pact

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.510

To develop such a game,

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.190
you must be a very meticulous person.

is making money your main goal

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:56.950
for developing games?

00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:59.140
Of course, not.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.380
My main goal

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:04.140
is for gamers to be happy.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.740
Mr. Pei, does your company have
the Last-place Elimination System?

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:10.950
Of course, not.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.740
All of them are my family members.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.740
Who would eliminate
their own family members?

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.140
Mr. Pei,

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.620
do the employees of your company
need to work overtime?

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.020
This is a huge problem for me.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.140
Since the beginning,

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.020
I've asked them not to work overtime

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.620
but I still couldn't stop them
from working overtime voluntarily.

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:27.950
Because of this,

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.260
I have no choice
but to give them overtime pay.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.020
I have one last question.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.950
Mr. Pei, do you develop games

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:38.380
to fulfill your own dream in gaming?

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.740
I did it to make money!

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.260
Mr. Pei, you must be joking.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.740
If you do it to make money,

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:53.620
you can totally

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.260
raise the price
of Divine General Pact tenfold.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.260
I get it now.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.110
I've benefited a lot

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:03.791
from being with you and your employees

00:10:03.835 --> 00:10:04.813

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.950
I was worried that card games
were already past their prime.

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:54.950
Now that I look at it,

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:56.950
isn't it just a timeless classic?

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:57.380
Indeed.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:58.620
Previously, I thought

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.110
Sky Fire was the industry standard,

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:01.380
but I think

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.230
Tengda is the greatest.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:04.620
You are right.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.500
Is that all

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.620
the famous Sky Fire got?

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.380
That company was my dream.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.620
I failed its recruitment

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.140
and was upset for so long.

00:11:12.191 --> 00:11:13.620
Its computers have bad specifications

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.235
and employees
are reprimanded for eating.

00:11:15.235 --> 00:11:17.020
They force employees to work overtime

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:17.950
without paying overtime.

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:20.835
How can they still call themselves
the best game developer in the country?

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:24.860
By comparison,

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.020
Mr. Pei treats us really well.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.380
I really want to get by at Tengda forever.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:33.950
No. I mean, I want
to work for Tengda until I retire.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.380
I just told Bao Xu about this.

00:11:36.447 --> 00:11:38.327
Mr. Liang,
we are getting more in sync now.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:39.950
Mr. Liang?

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:42.260
Why do you address him that way?

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:43.740
Out of respect.

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:45.524
Mr. Ma, you should call Mr. Pei.

00:11:45.546 --> 00:11:47.230
He must be present
at the celebratory feast.

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:47.620
Yes.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:48.950
I forgot about him.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.260
Mr. Pei, the dishes have been served.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:52.260
Come down and eat.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.620
All in all, Mr. Pei is
one of the best bosses in the world.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:57.990
He is the best there ever was.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:01.380
Everyone!

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.380

♪Now, I can't stop believing
you came down from heaven♪

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.620
How can I make money from that?

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.380
Do I really have
the talent for making money?

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:25.110
History has no pattern.
It is also full of coincidences.

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:27.470
You don't need to be so confident.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.950
You just got lucky.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:31.740
If you try to make money seriously,

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.020
you will fail miserably.

(Sky Fire Tower)

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.260
Mr. Zhou.

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:24.500
Lin Wan, come in.

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:27.590
It's late. What is it?

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:28.140
Sit.

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:32.470
Mr. Zhou, I've decided

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:33.710
to resign.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:37.140
Resign?

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:40.470
Are you leaving the game industry?

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.830
Do you not feel happy

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:48.740
working in Sky Fire?

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:50.590
Not at all.

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.110
I'm really grateful

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:54.260
for your care all this time, Mr. Zhou.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:55.260
However,

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.830
I think my ideologies
are different from the company

00:13:58.057 --> 00:13:59.500
so I want to work somewhere else.

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:02.020
Where are you going?

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:02.830
Tengda.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:08.350
Tengda?

00:14:09.457 --> 00:14:11.457
You only got in touch with them
for a few days,

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:12.830
and they've persuaded you?

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:15.350
That's right.

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:18.830
Tengda did make two viral games, indeed.

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:27.020
However, they are just a startup.

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.950
Everything is uncertain in the future.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.260
Lin Wan.

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.590
You are different from other people.

00:14:34.746 --> 00:14:36.124
You were born with

00:14:36.124 --> 00:14:38.140
what others have been pursuing
their whole lives.

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:40.380
What you need to do
is to use it to your advantage

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.740
to rise above others
by consolidating your resources.

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.350
There's no need for you to work so hard.

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:48.380
Mr. Zhou, thank you for your advice.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:49.380
However,

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:52.020
I won't trouble you

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:54.140
to help me do all that, Mr. Zhou.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:59.950
All right. I wish you all the best.

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:02.350
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

So much?

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:42.710
Did they make a mistake?

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:43.950
My salary isn't that high.

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:44.830
That's right.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.020
What's going on?

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:47.950
I don't know.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:52.710
Huang, how much did you get?

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:54.110
I dare not say it.

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:05.140
This is too much.

(Special Assistant Office)

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:12.230
The visit to Sky Fire's office

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.140
took away your off day.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.020
Mr. Pei figured
that all of you had worked hard.

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:18.140
Besides replacing your off day,

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.020
Mr. Pei has decided
to change the company's policy

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.590
and give all of you overtime pay.

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:24.500
Every employee who participated
in the teambuilding activity gets it.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:25.830
Moreover,

and Bao Xu.

00:16:28.857 --> 00:16:30.635
Both of you worked overtime in secret.

00:16:30.657 --> 00:16:31.710
Mr. Pei knew that.

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:34.350
So, both of you get
more overtime pay than others.

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:37.620
How did Mr. Pei find out?

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:38.620
I don't know.

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:41.350
Let me check my salary.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:45.950
Since my birth,

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:47.830
it's my first time
seeing so much overtime pay.

Ms. Xin,

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:05.950
why is there so much profit this time?

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:07.710
What is Mr. Sima

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:08.710
thinking about?

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:09.990
Did he notice

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:11.470
my talent for not losing money

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:13.740
so he sincerely invested in Tengda?

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:21.020
You are too confident, Mr. Pei.

00:17:21.146 --> 00:17:23.680
There's a line of entrepreneurs
that can go all the way to Paris

00:17:23.724 --> 00:17:25.300
trying to get an investment

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.020
from Mr. Sima.

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:29.020
That's right.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:31.780
Do you still remember the girl

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:33.300
who welcomed us

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.300
when we visited Sky Fire?

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:35.540
Lin Wan?

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:36.780
She came to Jinchuan.

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.720
She wants to work
in Tengda's planning department.

00:17:38.724 --> 00:17:40.020
She is firm about it.

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:41.540
She will even work for free.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.060
I thought
she was doing well at Sky Fire.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:46.710
Why did she come to Jinchuan?

00:17:48.257 --> 00:17:50.613
That girl looks like
she came from a rich family.

00:17:50.657 --> 00:17:52.124
She probably has some naive thoughts

00:17:52.168 --> 00:17:53.391
and did something unimaginable.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.300
If you think she's not the right person,

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.470
I'll reject her.

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.910
(A girl from a rich family
is a stubborn one.)

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.740
She might be an opportunity.

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:19.500
Let her stay.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.060
Pay her six times my salary.

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.780
She is a talent from Sky Fire after all.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:26.500
Just sign the contract with her
right away.

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:36.500
I pay salary, bonuses and overtime pay.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.780

travel for teambuilding activities.

everything

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:20.500
why did you suddenly
transfer to Tengda from Sky Fire?

We share different ideologies,
so I want to explore elsewhere.

for giving me this opportunity.

It's fine. You can drink the milkshake.

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.780
Tengda doesn't have a drinking culture.

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:36.780
Yes.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:40.740
No. I just feel like
drinking some sweet wine.

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:44.020
I saw it just now,
so I brought it with me.

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:46.990
You're good.

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:47.820
Not bad.

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:49.710
Mr. Pei,

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:51.020
here's a toast to you.

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:51.780
Don't worry.

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.580
I will work hard and do my best.

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:54.820
I'll never disappoint you.

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.300
There's no need to work too hard.

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.300
Just maintain your usual style.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.300
Be yourself.

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:04.780
Okay.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:09.230
Come on. Let's drink together.

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:10.390
From now on,

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:11.740
we will be colleagues.

Mr. Pei, why are you drinking shakes?

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.500
You drank a lot
during the teambuilding activity.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:18.740
Slow down. Not that one.

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:19.540
This is bad.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:20.300
Mr. Ma, not that.

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:21.260
Do another one.

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:21.780
Mr. Ma, no.

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:22.990
This won't work.

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:24.390
This won't work!

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.020
Mr. Ma!

00:20:30.791 --> 00:20:31.989
Mr. Ma, seriously.

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.657
Let's play again.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.740
These intellectual games don't suit you.

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.390
I didn't expect them
to get along so soon.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.300
These intellectual games don't suit you.

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.390
Let's play again.

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.300
Mr. Ma, you lost three times.

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.300
It's you every time. Seriously.

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:49.390
Shuffle.

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:52.260
Why does Mr. Pei look so troubled?

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.230
Did something happen?

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:56.020
No. Mr. Pei has always behaved this way.

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:58.540
He worries about his employees first

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.060
before feeling happy for them.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:05.580
Tengda's culture is special.

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.580

in the afternoon

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:08.780

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:12.230

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:15.813
under these special circumstances,

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:18.780
Mr. Pei must stay sober all the time.

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:23.020
Mr. Pei just doesn't want
to show his emotions.

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:27.020
He wants us to work relaxingly.

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:29.540
When we are having fun as a group,

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:30.390
he will be

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:32.300
thinking about Tengda's future alone.

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:35.020
He keeps thinking and thinking.

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:37.390
You don't know.

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:39.060
Let's continue.

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:42.230
Actually, Mr. Pei looks lonely.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:45.150
He is shouldering so much burden alone.

It's just the first one.

I'm not playing anymore.

Let's go to the karaoke.

Sure.

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:20.540
Mr. Pei, let's go to the karaoke.

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.580
Sure. Put it under the company's tab!

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:33.820
Wan,

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.100
I heard you resigned from Sky Fire.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.100
What happened?

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.430
Staying at Sky Fire is a waste of time.

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:42.630
I won't be able
to make the games I want.

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:44.910
So, I came to Jinchuan

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:47.870
and joined a company called Tengda.

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:49.340
Jinchuan?

00:22:49.502 --> 00:22:51.430
You just left
as soon as you made your decision?

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:53.500
Why didn't you discuss it with us?

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:54.580
Where are you staying?

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:57.820
Your father has a house over there.

00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:58.870
You can stay there.

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:00.390
I took the key before I left.

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:01.630
I'm already staying there.

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:03.780
Seriously?

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:06.470
What was the company called?

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:07.390
Tengda?

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:09.340
Is it legit?

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:10.870
I'll find someone to investigate it.

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:12.060
Don't be fooled.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.630
Mom, don't worry.

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:15.880
The company is very reliable.

00:23:15.946 --> 00:23:17.500
I also like this company a lot.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.340
The boss is someone I can work with.

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:21.020
Sure.

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:22.670
You must stay safe.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.430
I have a feeling

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:28.300
that Tengda is the company
I've always been looking for.

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:29.740
They are different.

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:31.500
Fine.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:32.580

It's so fat.

In the future,
we will make games with an algorithm.

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:32.670
Mr. Pei,

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:34.870
what did you say?

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:37.260
I'm saying
that our company will be making games

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:39.580
with the algorithm model in the future.

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:40.630
We will make any games

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:42.430
that are viral.

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:46.580
I want all of you

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:49.390
to research the most popular games
in the last two years.

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:51.020
There's no rush.

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:53.820
Adopt the strengths of others
to win against them.

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:54.580
But I...

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.035
Don't raise your objections first.

00:24:56.057 --> 00:24:56.820
In the future,

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:59.190
all of you
will understand why I do this.

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:01.580
Don't disappoint me.

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:15.300
Why does Mr. Pei

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.340
feel like a whole new person?

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.990
Did he get possessed
after visiting Sky Fire?

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:22.100
This is Zhou Muyan's style at Sky Fire.

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:24.340
Sky Fire does everything
that becomes popular.

00:25:24.368 --> 00:25:26.100
Since they have
a lot of funds and manpower,

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.050
they can copy games quickly
and make them popular.

00:25:28.057 --> 00:25:30.100
However, they don't care
about the future.

00:25:30.102 --> 00:25:31.391
Once the games become popular,

00:25:31.391 --> 00:25:33.340
they will let players
spend more money on the games.

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:35.120
Yes. Their games are dull.

00:25:35.124 --> 00:25:37.670
That is why every game of theirs
doesn't have a long shelf life.

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:38.820
That is the reason why

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:40.580
we think Sky Fire only looks good

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:42.340
on the outside.

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:44.340
In truth, it is just an empty shell.

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:46.100
Its future is actually uncertain.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:49.990
Why did Mr. Pei learn all the bad things

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:51.630
after visiting Sky Fire once?

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:54.870
But Mr. Pei said

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:57.430
we would understand
why he does this in the future.

00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:58.630
Think about it.

are both successful games.

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.580
They are both correct decisions
made by Mr. Pei.

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:08.150
When I was working on
Divine General Pact back then,

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:10.260
I didn't understand many things he did,

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:11.740
but I believe in him now.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:12.820
That's true.

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:14.340
His previous projects are all popular.

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.430
So, should we do as he says this time?

Mr. Zhou,

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:20.340
I rushed this out

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:22.150

Take a look.

This game is developed

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:33.340
by using successful games
from foreign countries.

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:35.580
So, no one will do this faster than us.

00:27:35.702 --> 00:27:38.020
This is the genre that
has become popular abroad recently.

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:40.340
Moreover, we redid the art.

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:41.430

Once Bullet Mark is launched,

00:27:49.702 --> 00:27:51.100
it will surely become popular.

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:56.870

Going by the algorithm is a good way.

without a care

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.300

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.020
and how gamers
are guided to pay for content.

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:23.990
Since we don't do that,

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.990
nothing will go wrong.

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:28.630
I was reminded of the fact
thanks to Lin Wan's transfer here.

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:31.100
This is how Fuhui spends money.

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:32.910
Sky Fire only inherits it.

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:34.340
We must also learn from them.

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:36.870
We'll spend the most money
to develop the lousiest game.

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:38.340
We'll spend every bit of money

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:39.820
earned from The Lonely Road

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:41.020
and Divine General Pact.

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:45.100
Come in.

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:46.990
Mr. Pei,

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:49.740
I'm here to make a report.

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:52.910
We spent a week

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:54.580
analyzing every ranking

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:55.340
and concluding

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:57.390
the most popular game genre.

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:02.940
(FPS games
with a deserted island setting)

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:04.940
(Design Draft)

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.124
First-person shooter games
with a special setting

00:29:08.146 --> 00:29:10.390
have indeed become popular
in recent years.

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:12.150
These are our initial thoughts

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:14.190
about this game.

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:15.580
Mr. Pei, take a look.

00:29:20.146 --> 00:29:22.190
They are all proposed
according to your requests.

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:23.260
Every segment

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:25.820
is made up of
the most popular elements in the market.

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:28.580
Moreover, as an important part of Tengda,

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:30.260
it is an important move

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:32.340
to improve the game coupling
of Tengda's games.

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.740
Do you want to develop this game?

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:36.430
Sure. Go ahead.

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:46.100
Sorry, Mr. Pei.

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:48.340
I've been working for huge companies
for a long time.

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:50.820
I said everything just now
out of my work habit.

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:52.430
I know Tengda is different.

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:53.580
Since you treat me so well,

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.100
I want to be honest with you.

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:58.390
This game is too mediocre.

00:29:58.500 --> 00:29:59.580
Mr. Pei, if you are...

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:00.340
Sibo, (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:04.260
do you still remember your promise?

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:07.100
You will never...

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:08.820
Disappoint you, Mr. Pei.

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:10.390
If you do as I say,

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:12.580
you will never disappoint me.

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:14.820
Mr. Pei,

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:16.990
do you have any ideas

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:18.150
for the title of this game?

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:22.740
Just call this game

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:24.430
Deserted.

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:25.580
Island.

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:26.540
Sharp.

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:27.740
Shooter.

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:29.820
It's so old-fashioned...

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:31.820
It's so sudden.

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:32.820
That suits it a lot.

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:34.260
It's mysterious and grand.

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:35.791
It sounds dangerous
without lacking depth.

00:30:35.813 --> 00:30:36.591
What a good name.

00:30:38.702 --> 00:30:39.740
That's right, Mr. Pei.

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:40.630
One more thing.

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:42.910
I heard Lin Wan say

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:45.060
that Sky Fire is also making

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:46.670
an FPS client-based game

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:48.020
with a similar setting

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:49.190
called Bullet Mark.

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:50.391
They invested a lot of money.

00:30:50.413 --> 00:30:51.430
If we compete with them

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:54.020
at the same time
with Deserted Island Sharpshooter...

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:55.820
Very good.

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:58.340
Sibo, don't be afraid of competition.

00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:59.580
If we can't avoid it,

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:01.580
we'll face the difficulty head-on.

00:31:04.791 --> 00:31:07.591
This time, we will do our best
to launch Deserted Island Sharpshooter

00:31:07.591 --> 00:31:09.340
on the same day as Bullet Mark.

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:10.820
We will spend money

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:12.080
and make a client-based game.

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:15.740
A client-based game
with a same-day launch?

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:17.630
Mr. Pei, we won't be able to make it.

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:20.190
I heard the employees
are working overtime every weekend

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:21.924
just to complete Bullet Mark.
Why don't we...

00:31:21.946 --> 00:31:24.740
Sibo, I'm going to criticize you
if you keep doing this.

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:26.057
When you encounter a problem at work,

00:31:26.057 --> 00:31:28.610
the first thing that comes to your mind
is actually working overtime?

00:31:28.613 --> 00:31:31.340
If you keep doing this long-term,
you will lose all your abilities.

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.910
You must think out of the box.

00:31:34.911 --> 00:31:36.580
The important thing is not perfection

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:38.150
but completion.

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:42.670
All right. I won't tell you more.

00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:44.990
You've worked hard recently.
Go home early and rest well.

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:46.190
That's right.

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:49.190
This proposal was done so quickly.

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:50.591
I hope no one did any overtime work.

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:51.580
Not at all.

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:55.500
It's not really working overtime.

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:57.740
When everyone was free at home,

00:31:57.740 --> 00:31:58.990
they thought about it.

00:31:59.924 --> 00:32:01.902
That's also a form
of sacrificing personal time

00:32:01.902 --> 00:32:03.260
for the company's benefits.

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.820
Go and get the overtime pay
after you get off work.

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:11.910
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

00:32:14.302 --> 00:32:16.020
I won't be disturbing you anymore, then.

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:30.260
Are you using that?

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:33.150
Stop. Don't make a mess.

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:42.100
What's wrong? You look gloomy.

00:32:42.168 --> 00:32:43.500
Did the proposal get rejected?

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:44.820
That's normal.

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:46.740
I figured changing just
the appearance of the game

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:47.990
won't be attractive enough.

00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:49.500
We just need to improve.

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:50.990
Don't be too sad.

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:52.910
The proposal

00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:54.190
has been approved?

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:55.500
What?

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:56.580
It has been approved?

00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:58.990
Bo, sit down and tell us about it.

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:05.340
Mr. Pei called this game

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:06.580
Deserted Island Sharpshooter.

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:09.910
What kind of name is that?

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:11.820
He also requested

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:14.430
that it go on sale on the same day
as Sky Fire's Bullet Mark.

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:15.719
He wants to develop standalone games

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.190
and doesn't allow us to work overtime.

00:33:17.435 --> 00:33:18.950
Bullet Mark has started for a long time,

00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:20.340
but we just started.

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:21.500
We won't be able to catch up.

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:23.190
Even if we make it, it'll be unrefined.

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:24.740
How can we compete with them?

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:27.190
Although not working overtime is good,

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:29.190
we won't be able to make it

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:30.580
in time.

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:32.340
He also said

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:34.340
we must think out of the box.

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:36.724
The most important thing
is not perfection but completion.

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:39.430
What does it mean?

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:41.780
Anyway, I don't get it this time.

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:45.020
Everyone,

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:47.430
although I'm not involved
in this project,

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:50.100
isn't it a good thing
for the proposal to be approved?

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:51.670
Just believe in Mr. Pei

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:53.190
and do it.

00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:58.150
What should we do?

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:01.100
Let's do it.

The feedback
for Bullet Mark's first play test

00:36:18.368 --> 00:36:19.220
is so bad.

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:21.020
Is there a problem with the genre?

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:23.390
There shouldn't be a problem.

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:26.100
A few FPS games
have been getting popular

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:27.580
in recent years.

00:36:27.635 --> 00:36:29.100
It's hard to create something special.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.660
Moreover, the deadline is tight.
This is all we can do.

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:34.020
Unless...

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:35.220
What?

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:37.580
Unless we change the whole foundation

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:39.100
and change the direction of the plan.

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:39.620
However,

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:41.140
that will take half a year to a year,

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:42.100
or even longer.

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:43.870
We have no time for big changes.

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:46.050
Tengda is developing
Deserted Island Sharpshooter.

00:36:46.057 --> 00:36:48.140
The name sounds low
and doesn't seem competitive,

00:36:48.146 --> 00:36:49.920
but our games
share the same genre after all.

00:36:49.924 --> 00:36:52.100
So, Bullet Mark
must be launched as soon as possible.

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:53.990
We have no choice but to improve

00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:55.500
on graphics and scenery details.

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:56.700
These are the costliest.

00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:58.910
Tengda has a low production cost.

00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:00.910
It's not difficult
for Bullet Mark to beat them.

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:05.750
Let's do that.

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:07.700
As long as we won't be shamed,

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.390
I can explain it
to Fuhui's headquarters.

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:14.580
This...

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:23.140
Bullet Mark's feedback is out.

00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:24.910
It's bad.

00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:28.700
The planning team
and art team bear the most fault.

00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:31.235
Come up with five
optimization proposals for me

00:37:31.257 --> 00:37:33.700
and submit them to me
by 8 AM in the morning tomorrow.

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:35.580
Don't slack.

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:36.580
It's urgent.

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:43.310
Does he think making upgrades

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:44.500
is a simple job?

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:45.870
If I keep working,

00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:47.540
I'm going to level up into a tombstone.

00:37:47.546 --> 00:37:50.500
The game itself is bad, and they are
only trying to improve the graphics.

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:52.020
That will just exhaust everyone.

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:53.060
Exactly.

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:57.910
Our work will never end.

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:02.820
(Shenhua International)

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:04.900
(Six Months Later)

00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:13.100
I can already do a play test, so soon?

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:13.750
Mr. Pei,

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:14.470
this time,

00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:16.100
we obeyed your rules strictly, this time

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:17.100
without working overtime.

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:27.870
Mr. Pei,

00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:29.910
we are already in the game!

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:32.060
This is the spawn point! The cockpit!

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:33.910
This is the game's battle mode.

00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:36.100
The good guys are the Justice Heroes.

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.060
The bad guys are the Berserk Warriors.

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:39.580
This time, I've set you up

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:40.591
on Team Justice Heroes.

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:43.700
What a normal setting.

00:38:46.413 --> 00:38:47.580
What is this set below us

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:50.270
that lacks any form of creativity?

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:52.100
Mr. Pei,

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:54.100
according to the algorithm's suggestion,

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:56.100
the game is set on

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:58.140
a mysterious and deserted island.

00:38:58.270 --> 00:38:59.660
The villainous organization

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:02.660
is carrying out
a scary virus experiment.

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:05.220
The Justice Heroes
are in charge of eliminating them

00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:06.270
to become the sharpshooter,

00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:07.220
escape from the island,

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:09.220
and save the Earth!

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:13.100
What a mediocre background story.

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:14.910
Mr. Pei, it's time to parachute down.

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:16.140
Parachute down!

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:34.870
Sibo!

00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:39.220
Mr. Pei.

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:40.700
Sibo, stop spacing out.

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:42.660
Save me. I can't get down.

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:43.750
This is just a game.

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:45.060
Just quit and restart the game.

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:49.540
Mr. Pei, you'll be fine this time!

00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:02.100
Mr. Pei. Mr. Pei!

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:04.180
Sorry.

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:05.540
I made a mistake.

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:09.580
Mr. Pei,
we'll definitely succeed this time!

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:23.270
Mr. Pei, this should be a bug.

00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:24.620
I will fix it.

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:26.220
Why don't we skip this part?

00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:44.100
Mr. Pei, look.
The Berserk Warriors are rushing here.

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:46.540
Take your weapon

00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:49.140
and prepare to fight.

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:53.430
Mr. Pei, you can't go there!

00:40:57.813 --> 00:40:58.857
The deadline is tight.

00:40:58.857 --> 00:41:00.620
We haven't completed
that part of the map yet.

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:02.060
It's an invisible barrier.

00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:14.140
Mr. Pei, you can't go there either!

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:15.140
There's a...

00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:22.660
Mine.

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:30.470
Mr. Pei.

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:33.540
Mr. Pei, let's go.

00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:39.470
Sibo.

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:41.470
Sibo, am I still alive?

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:45.060
Mr. Pei, this is just a visual effect.

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:46.413
It won't affect the gamer's health.

00:41:46.435 --> 00:41:48.790
According to the algorithm's
research and development analysis,

00:41:48.791 --> 00:41:50.900
dying too quickly
will affect the gamer's experience.

00:41:50.902 --> 00:41:51.470
Come on. (Support Admin Watch on

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:52.750
Experience it.

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:53.620
How do I use this?

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:54.635
Just squeeze the trigger.

00:41:56.924 --> 00:41:57.750
What do you think?

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:00.950
Which mode are we playing?

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:03.500
Fun mode.
It prioritizes player experience.

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:10.180
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:29.860
(Spectating)

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:33.180
(Spectating)

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:58.310
What a good yet mediocre game.

00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:00.990
What are you talking about, Mr. Pei?

00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:05.910
I'm saying that this is a good game.
