WEBVTT

00:00:04.642 --> 00:00:08.413
{\an8}Your son shoplifted from my store.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.080
{\an8}What?

00:00:09.647 --> 00:00:12.417
That is, if you show me your sincerity.

00:00:12.484 --> 00:00:14.819
We shouldn't let him manipulate us
any further.

00:00:15.386 --> 00:00:16.955
What is he demanding?

00:00:17.755 --> 00:00:18.723
Long time no see, Junichi.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:19.891
Junichi?

00:00:20.458 --> 00:00:23.361
You appeared before him as a detective.

00:00:23.428 --> 00:00:25.997
Sorry for making you worry.

00:00:26.564 --> 00:00:27.232
It's okay.

00:00:27.298 --> 00:00:30.168
The four people involved in the incident
23 years ago

00:00:30.235 --> 00:00:33.037
reunited because Sakuma was murdered.

00:00:33.104 --> 00:00:35.507
Let's open the time capsule.

00:00:36.074 --> 00:00:40.145
This will be a secret between
just the four of us.

00:00:45.316 --> 00:00:46.251
It's gone.

00:00:46.317 --> 00:00:50.421
One of us here opened the time capsule
and took out that gun.

00:00:50.488 --> 00:00:51.890
Give me time. I'll tell the truth.

00:00:51.956 --> 00:00:53.124
Why can't you tell me now?

00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:55.593
I can, but Makiko…

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.330
Ms. Makiko Iwamoto is clearly lying.

00:00:59.397 --> 00:01:01.900
I went because you suggested it.

00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:02.901
Why?

00:01:03.468 --> 00:01:04.736
I don't know why.

00:01:04.802 --> 00:01:09.073
I remember seeing someone walking around
the school grounds during my evening walk.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.042
It was a black SUV
with a Shinagawa license plate.

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:14.379
Is it because they used to be married?

00:01:15.346 --> 00:01:18.149
It's very interesting
how perfectly their alibis

00:01:19.717 --> 00:01:21.386
line up with each other.

00:01:26.324 --> 00:01:29.093
On January 18th, just after 9:00 a.m.,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.162
the body of Hideyuki Sakuma, the manager

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.431
of Smile Sakuma Mitsuba Minami branch,
was discovered.

00:01:33.498 --> 00:01:34.532
The murder weapon was a gun.

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:38.236
{\an8}The estimated time of death is just before
10:00 p.m. the previous day, Saturday.

00:01:39.037 --> 00:01:42.373
{\an8}There are only reports of hearing gunshots
and no eyewitness accounts.

00:01:42.941 --> 00:01:44.509
{\an8}There are no clues to the culprit,

00:01:44.576 --> 00:01:46.711
{\an8}and the murder weapon, the gun,
has not been found.

00:01:46.778 --> 00:01:47.612
{\an8}WEAPON - GUN
GUN THAT BELONGED TO OFFICER KIYOHARA

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:50.114
{\an8}The murder weapon is a gun
that belonged to Officer Kazuo Kiyohara,

00:01:50.181 --> 00:01:54.686
{\an8}who was shot and killed by the perpetrator
of the Yamato Trust Bank

00:01:55.253 --> 00:01:57.155
{\an8}armored car robbery 23 years ago.

00:01:57.222 --> 00:02:00.525
{\an8}It's the gun that has been missing
for the past 23 years.

00:02:00.592 --> 00:02:02.994
{\an8}We must find the culprit

00:02:03.061 --> 00:02:05.296
{\an8}and recover the gun as soon as possible.

00:02:06.497 --> 00:02:08.166
{\an8}As for the fact

00:02:08.233 --> 00:02:11.236
{\an8}that a police officer's gun was used
as the murder weapon,

00:02:11.302 --> 00:02:15.373
{\an8}the prefectural police's senior officials
are still carefully discussing the matter,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.942
including whether or not
to disclose it to the media.

00:02:18.443 --> 00:02:20.245
No conclusion has been reached yet.

00:02:20.812 --> 00:02:24.749
Please ensure that this information
is kept confidential.

00:02:24.816 --> 00:02:25.850
Yes, sir.

00:02:25.917 --> 00:02:32.590
MITSUBA POLICE STATION

00:02:47.071 --> 00:02:51.142
We have yet to determine the whereabouts
of the victim on the day of the incident.

00:02:51.976 --> 00:02:52.944
Sir.

00:02:53.878 --> 00:02:55.947
I talked to the employee
at the pachinko parlor

00:02:56.014 --> 00:02:58.349
but couldn't get any useful information.

00:02:58.983 --> 00:03:00.652
Anyone else find any leads?

00:03:00.718 --> 00:03:01.552
Yes, sir.

00:03:03.288 --> 00:03:05.657
Makiko Iwamoto visited Smile Sakuma
the day before the incident,

00:03:05.723 --> 00:03:08.993
so she was questioned as a witness,
but we have since found out that

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.595
she lied in her testimony.

00:03:10.662 --> 00:03:11.896
What?

00:03:11.963 --> 00:03:13.264
On that day, Ms. Iwamoto

00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:16.734
went to pick up her sixth-grade son
after he had been caught shoplifting.

00:03:16.801 --> 00:03:19.370
In exchange for keeping
the shoplifting incident a secret…

00:03:19.437 --> 00:03:21.172
You're saying that I have an accomplice?

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.307
That night, at 11:00 p.m.,

00:03:22.373 --> 00:03:25.009
Ms. Makiko Iwamoto and her ex-husband,
Mr. Keisuke Kiyohara,

00:03:25.076 --> 00:03:27.078
went to hand over the 300,000 yen.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.449
What were their alibis
on the day of the incident?

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.321
Yes, sir. The two were at a restaurant
in the city at 8:00 p.m.

00:03:36.387 --> 00:03:40.358
After 8:30 p.m., Ms. Makiko Iwamoto
went to Ma Saison hair salon,

00:03:40.425 --> 00:03:42.860
and Mr. Keisuke Kiyohara went to a hotel.

00:03:42.927 --> 00:03:45.196
They met again at the restaurant
at 10:30 p.m.

00:03:45.697 --> 00:03:48.599
It’s been confirmed that Mr. Kiyohara
did indeed go to the hotel.

00:03:48.666 --> 00:03:52.236
We have yet to confirm that Ms. Iwamoto
was indeed at the hair salon.

00:03:53.604 --> 00:03:54.706
Excuse me.

00:03:55.306 --> 00:03:56.507
Has the alibi

00:03:56.574 --> 00:03:59.977
of the victim's younger brother,
Mr. Naoto Sakuma, been verified?

00:04:00.645 --> 00:04:02.013
Well? Has it?

00:04:02.513 --> 00:04:03.514
Yes, sir.

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.086
Mr. Naoto Sakuma
returned from Korea on a flight

00:04:08.152 --> 00:04:12.056
arriving at Haneda Airport at 8:55 p.m.
He traveled home by car,

00:04:12.123 --> 00:04:14.592
and due to heavy traffic,
he arrived home shortly before 11:00 p.m.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.030
The 8:55 p.m. arrival time at Haneda
has been confirmed with the airline.

00:04:19.097 --> 00:04:22.700
His mother has corroborated
that he arrived home before 11:00 p.m.

00:04:24.902 --> 00:04:25.737
That's all.

00:04:27.105 --> 00:04:28.906
Verify the alibis of Iwamoto and Kiyohara

00:04:28.973 --> 00:04:32.210
and re-examine all witness accounts
from the surrounding area. Adjourned.

00:04:32.276 --> 00:04:33.311
Yes, sir.

00:04:37.515 --> 00:04:39.784
- You overslept?
- Sorry.

00:04:41.586 --> 00:04:46.190
Or are you
investigating something on your own?

00:04:46.257 --> 00:04:47.191
No.

00:04:47.692 --> 00:04:50.561
We're buddy detectives, right?

00:04:53.164 --> 00:04:54.599
I can't believe I said "buddy."

00:04:58.202 --> 00:04:59.036
I'm sorry.

00:04:59.971 --> 00:05:01.005
Yes, we're buddies.

00:05:01.072 --> 00:05:02.273
We're buddies.

00:05:20.358 --> 00:05:22.794
The entrance that will be built
around here

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.797
will be made with wood
from trees in Mitsuba City.

00:05:26.731 --> 00:05:28.332
We hope to create a shopping mall

00:05:29.033 --> 00:05:31.869
that exudes warmth,
and fosters a sense of community,

00:05:31.936 --> 00:05:35.640
so that everyone
will want to visit every day.

00:05:36.774 --> 00:05:39.477
Don't you think you should act
a little more like a company president?

00:05:39.544 --> 00:05:41.546
How does a president act?

00:05:41.612 --> 00:05:44.081
I guess they’re usually
confident and sharp.

00:05:44.582 --> 00:05:46.684
But I’m not even the president.

00:05:46.751 --> 00:05:49.854
You’re the managing director,
but you’re the next president.

00:05:49.921 --> 00:05:51.889
That’s true, but…

00:05:54.792 --> 00:05:58.095
Speaking of which, you used to get
a lot of arranged marriage proposals.

00:05:58.162 --> 00:06:01.899
To daughters of local company owners
or the granddaughters of chairmen.

00:06:03.034 --> 00:06:04.602
I haven't gotten any recently.

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:07.805
Maki told me to show her the photo
next time it happens.

00:06:08.473 --> 00:06:11.008
We want you to find
a good person to be with.

00:06:13.411 --> 00:06:16.047
{\an8}This is no time
for such carefree conversation.

00:06:16.681 --> 00:06:18.983
We’re doing it
because it’s not the right time.

00:06:20.084 --> 00:06:21.118
{\an8}You're right.

00:06:22.854 --> 00:06:23.754
Oh.

00:06:23.821 --> 00:06:24.655
What is it?

00:06:25.656 --> 00:06:27.592
Mom has been wanting
to invite everyone over

00:06:28.192 --> 00:06:31.395
for some hand-rolled sushi and madeleines,
just like the old days.

00:06:31.896 --> 00:06:33.364
Hand-rolled sushi?

00:06:33.431 --> 00:06:35.066
Junichi especially loved those.

00:06:35.132 --> 00:06:36.100
Yeah.

00:06:37.335 --> 00:06:38.169
Bye.

00:06:38.236 --> 00:06:39.237
{\an8}Bye.

00:06:44.108 --> 00:06:44.942
Hello?

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.646
Keisuke? Are you in Tokyo right now?

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.681
No, I’m in Mitsuba.

00:06:54.085 --> 00:06:55.253
Then how about we have a match?

00:06:56.654 --> 00:06:57.755
A match?

00:07:06.664 --> 00:07:09.667
How many years has it been?
Fifteen? Sixteen?

00:07:09.734 --> 00:07:10.668
You've got good footwork.

00:07:10.735 --> 00:07:12.436
I guess it’s muscle memory.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.708
You've still got it. You’ll be fine.

00:07:17.775 --> 00:07:19.210
Although I’ll be no match for you.

00:07:19.777 --> 00:07:21.379
It's okay. I’ll go easy on you.

00:07:21.445 --> 00:07:22.680
Yes, please.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.618
We haven’t had a match since that day.

00:07:28.619 --> 00:07:29.687
When we were in sixth grade.

00:07:30.788 --> 00:07:32.056
Red, Tobina.

00:07:32.123 --> 00:07:33.190
Ready.

00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.327
{\an8}- White, Kiyohara.
- Ready.

00:07:36.394 --> 00:07:37.795
{\an8}IROHADAI
KIYOHARA

00:07:38.563 --> 00:07:39.931
- Take position.
- Maki,

00:07:39.997 --> 00:07:41.198
- who are you cheering on?
- Bow.

00:07:44.035 --> 00:07:45.937
You’ll just have to cheer
for both of them, huh?

00:07:48.372 --> 00:07:50.074
I’m going to cheer on the match.

00:07:50.141 --> 00:07:51.943
Cheer on the match?

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:55.813
Let's cheer them on so that it will be
a memorable match

00:07:56.581 --> 00:07:57.615
for everyone.

00:07:57.682 --> 00:07:58.883
{\an8}Yeah.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.518
{\an8}Good idea, Maki.

00:08:10.227 --> 00:08:11.095
Begin.

00:08:39.123 --> 00:08:40.291
You can do it.

00:08:42.026 --> 00:08:43.127
Winner.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.067
Keisuke.

00:08:50.134 --> 00:08:51.902
Keisuke!

00:08:51.969 --> 00:08:54.171
- You were strong too.
- Good job.

00:08:54.238 --> 00:08:55.072
Good job.

00:09:19.664 --> 00:09:21.332
Keisuke, you're the one who opened

00:09:23.934 --> 00:09:25.002
the time capsule, right?

00:09:27.838 --> 00:09:28.673
What?

00:09:31.442 --> 00:09:33.344
On Friday night,
the day before the incident,

00:09:35.079 --> 00:09:37.615
your car was spotted
near the abandoned school.

00:09:38.315 --> 00:09:40.785
- Someone also saw a man walking through--
- Wait, hold on!

00:09:40.851 --> 00:09:42.720
- Did you take out the gun?
- No, it wasn’t me.

00:09:43.888 --> 00:09:45.623
Then why were you there?

00:09:58.135 --> 00:09:59.136
It’s true

00:10:00.938 --> 00:10:02.540
that I went there to open
the time capsule.

00:10:04.508 --> 00:10:06.277
But the gun was already gone.

00:10:07.678 --> 00:10:08.746
What?

00:10:08.813 --> 00:10:12.149
I opened the time capsule,
but there was no gun inside.

00:10:14.285 --> 00:10:15.853
- Are you serious?
- I’m not lying.

00:10:18.022 --> 00:10:19.924
Why did you dig up the time capsule?

00:10:21.358 --> 00:10:25.129
I was thinking of taking it with me for
self-defense when I went to see Sakuma.

00:10:27.865 --> 00:10:30.735
You might not believe it,
but the gun was already gone.

00:10:30.801 --> 00:10:33.637
I even have an alibi during the time
Sakuma was killed.

00:10:33.704 --> 00:10:35.940
I didn't use the gun,
or take it from the time capsule.

00:10:38.909 --> 00:10:41.278
What if the person who took the gun
and the person who used it

00:10:42.413 --> 00:10:43.981
were two different people?

00:10:45.249 --> 00:10:46.183
What?

00:10:50.387 --> 00:10:52.089
Makiko's alibi has not been proven.

00:10:54.558 --> 00:10:56.660
Are you trying to say that I took the gun,

00:10:56.727 --> 00:10:58.829
and then Makiko used it?

00:10:59.897 --> 00:11:01.732
There's no way I'd let Makiko do that.

00:11:01.799 --> 00:11:04.568
- I don’t think that you would either!
- Then what is it?

00:11:07.338 --> 00:11:09.173
Either way, the gun was gone.

00:11:10.741 --> 00:11:13.277
I haven't told anyone that I went
to dig it up. Not even Makiko.

00:11:16.647 --> 00:11:17.748
So?

00:11:18.749 --> 00:11:20.785
The time capsule was opened two times.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.030
That means someone took the gun
out of that time capsule years ago,

00:11:33.964 --> 00:11:35.366
and kept it hidden?

00:11:35.432 --> 00:11:36.934
That’s the only possible answer.

00:11:38.569 --> 00:11:40.271
If you’re telling the truth,

00:11:41.739 --> 00:11:43.541
then it would have to be either
Makiko or Naoto.

00:11:48.979 --> 00:11:50.014
What if

00:11:50.748 --> 00:11:51.849
it’s Naoto?

00:11:54.718 --> 00:11:57.454
If Naoto had dug up that gun
a few years ago…

00:11:59.824 --> 00:12:00.858
Let’s say

00:12:01.559 --> 00:12:04.261
that he knew he couldn't possibly
beat his brother in a physical fight.

00:12:04.328 --> 00:12:07.064
So he wanted to have a powerful weapon
and opened the time capsule.

00:12:07.131 --> 00:12:09.934
Even if he had taken the gun
and kept it hidden all this time,

00:12:10.801 --> 00:12:13.804
do you really think he would use it
because he hated his brother?

00:12:18.108 --> 00:12:19.743
Of all things, it was your pops' gun.

00:12:22.847 --> 00:12:24.181
He's not that kind of guy.

00:12:24.882 --> 00:12:26.417
He could never kill anyone.

00:12:26.483 --> 00:12:27.751
Makiko wouldn’t either.

00:12:27.818 --> 00:12:28.853
Yeah.

00:12:32.056 --> 00:12:33.924
I don’t think she’d dig up
the time capsule either.

00:12:41.732 --> 00:12:44.602
{\an8}KOTONO

00:12:45.102 --> 00:12:46.070
I have to take this.

00:13:00.317 --> 00:13:03.721
Don’t you have any friends
to play catch with?

00:13:04.455 --> 00:13:05.322
No.

00:13:06.624 --> 00:13:07.625
I see.

00:13:08.626 --> 00:13:09.960
Maybe I'll play with you.

00:13:11.462 --> 00:13:12.296
Oh, come on.

00:13:12.363 --> 00:13:15.566
You don't have to look so disgusted
by that idea.

00:13:19.503 --> 00:13:21.538
Let’s eat. Go wash your hands.

00:13:23.507 --> 00:13:24.508
Okay.

00:13:31.382 --> 00:13:32.483
Okay.

00:13:33.717 --> 00:13:35.152
Take it easy and rest.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:37.521
Bye.

00:13:47.097 --> 00:13:49.767
That was a call from my wife.

00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:53.637
I remarried.

00:13:56.674 --> 00:13:57.608
When?

00:13:58.142 --> 00:13:59.376
A year ago.

00:14:00.644 --> 00:14:02.046
She’s pregnant.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.315
Does Makiko know?

00:14:04.982 --> 00:14:06.083
No.

00:14:07.584 --> 00:14:10.955
She doesn’t know about the marriage
or the kid.

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:16.026
I was going to tell her after Masaki's
exams, but then the incident happened,

00:14:16.527 --> 00:14:17.695
so she doesn't know yet.

00:14:21.999 --> 00:14:23.500
Please don’t tell Makiko about it.

00:14:24.068 --> 00:14:26.203
Of course. It's not my place to say.

00:14:27.304 --> 00:14:28.305
Yeah, you're right.

00:14:31.675 --> 00:14:34.311
Married twice with two kids, huh?

00:14:36.246 --> 00:14:37.881
I guess I prefer to be married.

00:14:39.516 --> 00:14:40.584
But you got divorced.

00:14:41.852 --> 00:14:43.487
You make no sense.

00:14:43.554 --> 00:14:45.689
I wasn’t the right fit
as Makiko’s husband, that’s all.

00:14:49.259 --> 00:14:50.160
Hey,

00:14:51.729 --> 00:14:54.064
what do you think Makiko will say
when I tell her I remarried?

00:14:56.266 --> 00:14:58.135
Makiko isn’t the only one
who'd have an opinion.

00:14:58.902 --> 00:15:00.871
- You mean Naoto?
- Yeah.

00:15:02.106 --> 00:15:04.041
- He’ll probably get mad.
- For sure.

00:15:05.943 --> 00:15:07.878
I haven't told my wife about the incident.

00:15:08.445 --> 00:15:10.748
I'm hiding things
from both her and Makiko.

00:15:10.814 --> 00:15:12.216
It's so exhausting.

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:15.319
You’ve always been
tiptoeing around other people.

00:15:15.853 --> 00:15:17.755
I don’t want anyone to not like me.

00:15:24.795 --> 00:15:25.863
I know that.

00:15:25.929 --> 00:15:27.965
How annoying.

00:15:37.474 --> 00:15:38.542
Don’t you have to go?

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:41.178
Where are you headed now?

00:15:43.514 --> 00:15:44.748
I’m going back to the station.

00:15:47.017 --> 00:15:47.918
Then let’s go.

00:15:50.687 --> 00:15:51.522
Let’s go.

00:15:55.025 --> 00:15:55.893
Here.

00:15:55.959 --> 00:15:56.927
Thanks.

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:01.131
What a hassle.

00:16:03.634 --> 00:16:05.135
- So immature.
- Let's go.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:11.442
- Hope your wife is okay.
- Thanks.

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:14.845
Hey.

00:16:15.646 --> 00:16:16.547
Yeah?

00:16:17.514 --> 00:16:20.017
What did you think when you met Makiko
for the first time in 23 years?

00:16:22.753 --> 00:16:23.620
What?

00:16:27.724 --> 00:16:28.759
Never mind. Let's go.

00:16:41.505 --> 00:16:43.173
MAKIKO IWAMOTO

00:16:43.874 --> 00:16:45.075
Please give me a call.

00:16:51.782 --> 00:16:55.886
JUNICHI

00:16:58.055 --> 00:16:58.889
Junichi?

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:00.390
Yeah.

00:17:01.191 --> 00:17:02.092
What’s up?

00:17:04.962 --> 00:17:06.230
Listen,

00:17:07.898 --> 00:17:11.869
I don't know if I should be saying this
given our current situation, but…

00:17:14.471 --> 00:17:15.372
Then

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.174
maybe you shouldn’t.

00:17:18.809 --> 00:17:19.910
I guess so, huh?

00:17:20.978 --> 00:17:22.679
I figured as much.

00:17:24.481 --> 00:17:25.682
But you’ll say it anyways, right?

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:27.918
Yeah.

00:17:31.455 --> 00:17:32.422
What is it?

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:36.160
If you have time,

00:17:36.994 --> 00:17:39.329
I'd like you to play catch
with Masaki again.

00:17:42.299 --> 00:17:46.069
I totally understand if you say no.

00:17:46.136 --> 00:17:47.037
Sure.

00:17:47.738 --> 00:17:48.705
Sure, what?

00:17:49.473 --> 00:17:51.141
Sure, I can play catch.

00:17:52.176 --> 00:17:53.744
Really? It's not too much for you?

00:17:54.478 --> 00:17:55.412
No.

00:17:58.215 --> 00:17:59.850
Yay!

00:17:59.917 --> 00:18:01.685
Masaki will be so happy.

00:18:02.486 --> 00:18:04.221
Oh, if you have time, stay for dinner too.

00:18:08.792 --> 00:18:09.660
Okay.

00:18:11.795 --> 00:18:13.964
I’ll contact you again.

00:18:14.665 --> 00:18:16.500
Okay, bye.

00:18:17.034 --> 00:18:17.968
Bye.

00:18:24.141 --> 00:18:26.543
It seemed like you were enjoying
that call.

00:18:27.711 --> 00:18:28.879
You were still here, huh?

00:18:30.614 --> 00:18:34.151
I’m reviewing the case from 23 years ago
to make sure nothing was overlooked.

00:18:35.586 --> 00:18:36.587
By the way,

00:18:37.487 --> 00:18:39.590
what is your alibi, Detective Tobina?

00:18:40.157 --> 00:18:40.891
What?

00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:43.093
I’m just asking as a formality.

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:46.330
Of the people involved
with the incident 23 years ago,

00:18:46.396 --> 00:18:50.334
I've already asked Ms. Makiko Iwamoto,
Mr. Keisuke Kiyohara,

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.769
and Mr. Naoto Sakuma about their alibis.

00:18:55.706 --> 00:18:59.543
Detective Tobina,
where were you and what were you doing

00:19:00.277 --> 00:19:02.112
on the night of the incident?

00:19:03.447 --> 00:19:05.415
{\an8}Where were you and what were you doing

00:19:06.083 --> 00:19:07.884
{\an8}on the night of the incident?

00:19:14.391 --> 00:19:15.959
Playing mahjong at a mahjong parlor.

00:19:19.263 --> 00:19:20.530
I lost horribly.

00:19:22.032 --> 00:19:23.867
I see.

00:19:41.485 --> 00:19:42.319
Excuse me.

00:19:42.386 --> 00:19:44.721
I'm Tobina from the Mitsuba Police.

00:19:44.788 --> 00:19:47.291
Sorry to bother you,
but can I ask you some questions?

00:19:47.357 --> 00:19:49.860
MITSUBA POLICE

00:19:49.926 --> 00:19:52.763
Oh man, it's so cold.

00:19:52.829 --> 00:19:55.065
I'm back.

00:19:55.666 --> 00:19:56.633
Ms. Nara.

00:19:57.167 --> 00:19:59.236
Ms. Nara, I got the monaka from Kigetsu.

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:02.472
And here's your change.

00:20:02.539 --> 00:20:05.342
Sorry, there's lots of coins.

00:20:05.876 --> 00:20:07.744
Are there any developments regarding that?

00:20:08.412 --> 00:20:09.780
I'm still investigating.

00:20:10.914 --> 00:20:12.616
Just to confirm,

00:20:12.683 --> 00:20:15.052
you haven't mentioned that
to Detective Tobina, have you?

00:20:15.619 --> 00:20:16.520
No.

00:20:17.487 --> 00:20:19.790
But are you sure about this?

00:20:19.856 --> 00:20:20.724
He’s your buddy, right?

00:20:20.791 --> 00:20:23.360
Detective Tanaka,
please continue working hard.

00:20:26.496 --> 00:20:27.431
I'm Nagai.

00:20:27.497 --> 00:20:31.201
You bloomed so beautifully.

00:20:31.702 --> 00:20:33.070
Chief Kosugi!

00:20:34.071 --> 00:20:35.739
Do you like monaka?

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.241
You conducted research on me, huh?

00:20:38.308 --> 00:20:40.243
Guilty as charged.

00:20:40.744 --> 00:20:42.079
I love it.

00:20:42.145 --> 00:20:44.715
Can we enjoy these in your office?

00:20:44.781 --> 00:20:46.783
Of course. Let's go.

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:47.751
{\an8}KIGETSU

00:20:47.818 --> 00:20:49.286
{\an8}Chief Kosugi,

00:20:49.353 --> 00:20:53.423
since when have you worked
here at Mitsuba Police Station?

00:20:54.524 --> 00:20:57.761
I first worked here 25 years ago,

00:20:57.828 --> 00:20:59.629
then moved around to various places,

00:21:00.664 --> 00:21:03.467
and returned five years ago
as the police chief.

00:21:03.533 --> 00:21:08.305
The weapon used to murder Sakuma
was the gun of Officer Kazuo Kiyohara,

00:21:08.372 --> 00:21:11.074
who died in the line of duty 23 years ago.

00:21:11.141 --> 00:21:12.008
Yes.

00:21:12.509 --> 00:21:15.846
Keisuke Kiyohara,
the son of Officer Kiyohara,

00:21:15.912 --> 00:21:19.816
was one of the people questioned
as a witness in the Sakuma murder case.

00:21:21.351 --> 00:21:24.121
The other people I spoke to are

00:21:24.187 --> 00:21:26.223
Keisuke Kiyohara's ex-wife,
Makiko Iwamoto,

00:21:27.157 --> 00:21:30.093
the victim Hideyuki Sakuma's brother,
Naoto Sakuma,

00:21:30.694 --> 00:21:32.996
and Detective Junichi Tobina,

00:21:33.063 --> 00:21:34.664
who was assigned here two months ago.

00:21:35.432 --> 00:21:38.335
They were the first to discover
the body of Officer Kazuo Kiyohara

00:21:38.402 --> 00:21:42.172
when they were all in the sixth grade
of elementary school?

00:21:42.739 --> 00:21:43.607
Were you aware of that?

00:21:44.174 --> 00:21:45.108
Yes.

00:21:49.846 --> 00:21:51.681
How did you find out, Ms. Nara?

00:21:52.315 --> 00:21:56.119
I read all the investigation materials
from that time, cover to cover.

00:21:56.653 --> 00:21:57.788
I see.

00:21:57.854 --> 00:22:01.691
I would like to speak again
with people who were familiar

00:22:01.758 --> 00:22:03.560
with the situation at that time.

00:22:05.829 --> 00:22:09.366
When that incident happened, I was working
in the administration department,

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:13.837
but I was called into action because
a robber and murderer was on the loose.

00:22:15.071 --> 00:22:17.207
The four of them,
who were still kids at the time,

00:22:17.274 --> 00:22:20.444
were taken in since they were
the first to discover the bodies,

00:22:21.445 --> 00:22:23.480
and I was there to see all that unfold.

00:22:24.548 --> 00:22:28.618
When Detective Tobina was assigned here
two months ago,

00:22:28.685 --> 00:22:32.622
you knew that he was one of the boys
from back then?

00:22:33.323 --> 00:22:34.191
Yes.

00:22:34.758 --> 00:22:38.094
The incident from 23 years ago
and Sakuma's murder

00:22:38.728 --> 00:22:41.097
are connected by Officer Kiyohara's gun,

00:22:41.164 --> 00:22:44.034
and the four classmates.

00:22:45.001 --> 00:22:48.872
I don't know how being the first
to discover the police officer's body

00:22:49.773 --> 00:22:54.110
affected the children's lives afterward,

00:22:55.445 --> 00:22:57.080
but in Tobina's case,

00:22:57.147 --> 00:23:01.051
there's no doubt that he is currently
a very excellent police officer.

00:23:01.117 --> 00:23:07.290
Even if his classmate
is involved with Hideyuki Sakuma's murder,

00:23:08.024 --> 00:23:12.128
Tobina would never allow personal matters
to affect his investigation.

00:23:15.699 --> 00:23:19.002
I’m glad I got to hear your input.

00:23:23.773 --> 00:23:25.809
- I’ll be going now.
- What?

00:23:25.876 --> 00:23:27.811
You’re not going to eat the monaka?

00:23:29.145 --> 00:23:32.349
I'm in the mood for something spicy
rather than something sweet.

00:23:32.415 --> 00:23:33.383
I'll be going now.

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:35.452
Then I’ll enjoy these myself.

00:23:35.519 --> 00:23:37.220
Please do. Excuse me.

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.462
I’ll meet up with you later too.

00:23:45.529 --> 00:23:47.397
- What?
- Don't sound so disappointed.

00:23:48.164 --> 00:23:49.766
- Have fun.
- Bye.

00:23:49.833 --> 00:23:51.301
- You forgot your ball!
- What?

00:23:51.835 --> 00:23:54.804
You can't forget the ball.

00:23:54.871 --> 00:23:56.473
- Catch.
- You scared me!

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:57.407
- Here.
- Thanks.

00:23:57.474 --> 00:23:59.309
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:23:59.376 --> 00:24:00.877
- Be careful.
- Yeah.

00:24:12.956 --> 00:24:14.357
Let's use this.

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:23.567
Thank you. Goodbye.

00:24:29.506 --> 00:24:31.541
- Sore muscles?
- Yeah.

00:24:32.108 --> 00:24:35.078
Actually, I did kendo yesterday
as part of a work-related activity.

00:24:35.145 --> 00:24:37.814
- You can do kendo?
- I did it from elementary to high school.

00:24:37.881 --> 00:24:39.916
- Oh really?
- I was pretty strong.

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:42.852
My dad taught it in elementary school,

00:24:43.353 --> 00:24:45.755
and our team won
a competition in sixth grade.

00:24:49.859 --> 00:24:52.662
In the individual competition,
my teammate won first place,

00:24:53.163 --> 00:24:54.965
and I came in second.

00:24:57.334 --> 00:25:00.270
My dad was the teacher,
so I felt that I had to be the best.

00:25:04.641 --> 00:25:05.575
You know,

00:25:06.776 --> 00:25:10.280
when I was in elementary school, I was
good at sports, academics, everything.

00:25:11.214 --> 00:25:16.620
But he always defeated me, when it came to
things that I desperately wanted to win.

00:25:17.721 --> 00:25:21.191
Did that person
defeat you in anything aside from kendo?

00:25:23.226 --> 00:25:24.060
Yeah…

00:25:24.928 --> 00:25:26.096
Sounds good.

00:25:26.763 --> 00:25:27.631
Will you guys come too?

00:25:28.198 --> 00:25:29.432
Yeah.

00:25:34.704 --> 00:25:37.507
But I don’t remember.
Not sure what it was now.

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:41.745
I'll be off now.

00:25:42.445 --> 00:25:43.380
Bye.

00:25:48.985 --> 00:25:50.820
Masaki, hold it like this.

00:25:52.455 --> 00:25:53.523
Grip the ball like this.

00:25:54.724 --> 00:25:56.259
- Like this, got it?
- Okay.

00:25:56.326 --> 00:25:57.293
Try it.

00:25:59.262 --> 00:26:00.997
- Like this?
- Yeah.

00:26:01.064 --> 00:26:02.666
- Try throwing it like that.
- Okay.

00:26:05.235 --> 00:26:06.403
That was cool.

00:26:06.469 --> 00:26:07.437
One more time.

00:26:08.838 --> 00:26:09.973
- Okay.
- Good.

00:26:10.674 --> 00:26:11.541
Like this.

00:26:12.742 --> 00:26:14.144
- Like this?
- Good.

00:26:19.816 --> 00:26:21.051
It's a lot faster now.

00:26:21.117 --> 00:26:22.752
Thank you so much.

00:26:26.423 --> 00:26:27.957
- Good job.
- That was good.

00:26:29.759 --> 00:26:31.761
I'm back.

00:26:31.828 --> 00:26:33.063
Thanks.

00:26:33.129 --> 00:26:34.030
Masaki, break time.

00:26:34.097 --> 00:26:34.931
Okay.

00:26:38.768 --> 00:26:39.836
Masaki.

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:41.938
My mom's here.

00:26:43.273 --> 00:26:44.340
Hello.

00:26:48.812 --> 00:26:50.046
{\an8}This is Mr. Junichi's girlfriend.

00:26:51.047 --> 00:26:52.615
{\an8}Nice to meet you. I'm Hiromi.

00:26:53.583 --> 00:26:55.218
I'm Masaki's mother.

00:26:55.752 --> 00:26:57.721
Hiromi happened to have a day off today.

00:26:59.122 --> 00:27:02.459
Sorry to make you hang out with Masaki
on your day off.

00:27:02.525 --> 00:27:03.893
Not at all.

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.762
Junichi is having the most fun.

00:27:06.796 --> 00:27:07.831
That's true.

00:27:09.132 --> 00:27:11.134
Time to switch. I want to play too.

00:27:11.668 --> 00:27:12.736
You can do it?

00:27:12.802 --> 00:27:15.238
- I'll do it. I'm sure I can.
- Can you really?

00:27:15.305 --> 00:27:16.539
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:27:16.606 --> 00:27:17.507
Ready.

00:27:18.074 --> 00:27:19.042
Wow.

00:27:19.109 --> 00:27:20.310
- I caught it.
- Nice.

00:27:20.877 --> 00:27:21.811
I'll throw it now.

00:27:22.912 --> 00:27:23.747
Junichi…

00:27:23.813 --> 00:27:25.081
That's what she calls you, huh?

00:27:26.816 --> 00:27:27.717
Yeah. So?

00:27:28.585 --> 00:27:30.086
You guys are really far apart, huh?

00:27:30.153 --> 00:27:31.354
- In age?
- Yeah.

00:27:31.421 --> 00:27:32.322
Ten years.

00:27:32.822 --> 00:27:34.257
She's so young.

00:27:34.991 --> 00:27:36.359
But she's mature for her age.

00:27:37.327 --> 00:27:39.596
- Yeah, she's really calm.
- Yeah.

00:27:39.662 --> 00:27:41.297
- What does she do for work?
- She's a nurse.

00:27:46.035 --> 00:27:48.171
Oh, it makes sense now…

00:27:48.238 --> 00:27:49.672
What do you mean?

00:27:50.206 --> 00:27:51.441
You approached her at the hospital?

00:27:51.508 --> 00:27:53.476
No, she approached me.

00:27:53.543 --> 00:27:56.146
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I'm serious.

00:27:56.713 --> 00:27:58.748
- The cut is pretty deep.
- Yes.

00:27:59.382 --> 00:28:01.417
I was chasing a pick-pocket

00:28:01.484 --> 00:28:05.255
and I almost tripped,
so I grabbed on to the guardrail.

00:28:05.321 --> 00:28:06.456
Then this happened.

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:07.957
Let's stitch it up.

00:28:08.458 --> 00:28:09.626
- It needs stitching?
- Yes.

00:28:09.692 --> 00:28:11.060
- Clean the wound please.
- Yes.

00:28:13.363 --> 00:28:15.532
Please place your hand here.

00:28:16.099 --> 00:28:19.669
It might sting a little.

00:28:25.708 --> 00:28:26.709
Mr. Tobina.

00:28:27.243 --> 00:28:28.077
Yes?

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.381
Um…

00:28:32.782 --> 00:28:34.551
Can I ask you for advice about something?

00:28:52.268 --> 00:28:53.703
Stay away from Hiromi.

00:28:54.204 --> 00:28:56.306
- I've done nothing.
- You're following her every night.

00:28:56.372 --> 00:28:58.374
No I am not. Leave me alone.

00:28:58.441 --> 00:28:59.642
Not so fast.

00:28:59.709 --> 00:29:00.710
- Hey.
- Let me go.

00:29:00.777 --> 00:29:02.312
Hey, hold on.

00:29:02.378 --> 00:29:03.379
Don't get carried away.

00:29:04.547 --> 00:29:05.481
Hey.

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:08.184
- Don't get cocky with me.
- Sorry.

00:29:08.251 --> 00:29:09.586
- I'm sorry.
- What'd you say?

00:29:09.652 --> 00:29:10.987
I'm sorry. I'll stop.

00:29:11.054 --> 00:29:13.022
That's how it began.

00:29:15.191 --> 00:29:16.559
How long have you guys been going out?

00:29:17.994 --> 00:29:19.062
About three years.

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:21.264
I see.

00:29:21.798 --> 00:29:22.866
Yeah.

00:29:22.932 --> 00:29:24.801
Two months ago,

00:29:24.868 --> 00:29:27.937
I was assigned to Mitsuba Police Station,
and Hiromi tagged along.

00:29:29.873 --> 00:29:31.074
Tagged along?

00:29:32.175 --> 00:29:34.177
She came to my place
and made herself at home.

00:29:35.245 --> 00:29:37.046
You two are living together?

00:29:37.881 --> 00:29:38.915
Yeah.

00:29:44.153 --> 00:29:45.154
Are you going to marry her?

00:29:53.997 --> 00:29:54.931
Junichi.

00:29:56.266 --> 00:29:57.400
Yeah?

00:29:57.467 --> 00:29:58.401
Let's switch.

00:29:59.202 --> 00:30:00.103
That was fast.

00:30:00.603 --> 00:30:01.871
I played enough.

00:30:01.938 --> 00:30:02.939
Okay.

00:30:05.508 --> 00:30:08.044
- You had fun?
- I did my best. It was fun.

00:30:08.111 --> 00:30:09.078
You weren't bad.

00:30:09.145 --> 00:30:10.880
Really? Then praise me.

00:30:10.947 --> 00:30:11.981
- What?
- Praise me.

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:21.891
Nice.

00:30:22.458 --> 00:30:24.060
I'm so glad I got to meet you.

00:30:24.127 --> 00:30:25.595
Oh, you are?

00:30:26.796 --> 00:30:30.199
Since Junichi never talked about
his friends before.

00:30:32.568 --> 00:30:35.438
I haven't really seen him play catch
before either.

00:30:36.306 --> 00:30:38.274
He'll be a great dad.

00:30:40.576 --> 00:30:44.781
Oh sorry, don't take that to mean
that I'm rushing you guys into marriage.

00:30:44.847 --> 00:30:46.082
No worries.

00:30:48.384 --> 00:30:50.286
We never discuss marriage.

00:30:51.921 --> 00:30:55.291
Well, you're still only 25, right?

00:30:55.792 --> 00:30:57.360
Yeah…

00:30:57.427 --> 00:31:00.496
But I don't think that's the issue.

00:31:03.399 --> 00:31:04.467
Sorry, it's complicated.

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:08.771
I just don't think

00:31:09.706 --> 00:31:13.042
this relationship will lead to marriage,
that's all.

00:31:15.311 --> 00:31:16.713
I see.

00:31:18.781 --> 00:31:19.949
But

00:31:20.817 --> 00:31:22.919
it feels great to spend time outside.

00:31:24.721 --> 00:31:29.892
It's been a long time
since we went out together like this.

00:31:30.526 --> 00:31:31.995
I see.

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:36.265
After this,
we're stopping by the supermarket

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.736
to make hand-rolled sushi at home.

00:31:41.804 --> 00:31:43.072
Is that right?

00:31:43.573 --> 00:31:46.209
Junichi suddenly said that he wanted
to eat hand-rolled sushi.

00:31:48.244 --> 00:31:49.145
I see.

00:31:51.014 --> 00:31:53.082
I'm getting fired up now.

00:31:53.149 --> 00:31:54.350
- All right.
- Let's do this.

00:32:07.697 --> 00:32:09.365
Wash your hands.

00:32:24.914 --> 00:32:25.882
Hello?

00:32:25.948 --> 00:32:27.984
Hey.

00:32:28.051 --> 00:32:30.319
I know it's sudden,
but can I see Masaki today?

00:32:30.386 --> 00:32:31.320
What?

00:32:31.988 --> 00:32:33.289
I have some time today.

00:32:34.057 --> 00:32:36.959
Yeah, sure.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.695
Maybe the three of us can go eat out.

00:32:42.732 --> 00:32:43.933
Come eat at our place.

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:46.169
I already prepared dinner.

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:49.338
And it's more relaxing at home.

00:32:50.506 --> 00:32:52.275
Okay. Bye.

00:33:00.349 --> 00:33:01.417
{\an8}Hand-rolled sushi?

00:33:01.918 --> 00:33:03.519
Why are you laughing?

00:33:03.586 --> 00:33:07.156
It's just that Naoto and I
were just talking about hand-rolled sushi.

00:33:07.223 --> 00:33:08.424
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

00:33:08.491 --> 00:33:09.792
It was fun back then.

00:33:09.859 --> 00:33:12.428
Junichi was always eating
Alaskan pink shrimp.

00:33:12.929 --> 00:33:14.630
You have such a good memory.

00:33:16.299 --> 00:33:18.101
- Hey Masaki.
- Dad, you’re late.

00:33:18.167 --> 00:33:20.103
- Sorry.
- I'm so hungry.

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:22.171
What did you do today?

00:33:22.238 --> 00:33:23.239
I was playing catch.

00:33:23.306 --> 00:33:25.208
- With your friend?
- No, Mr. Junichi.

00:33:26.542 --> 00:33:27.677
What?

00:33:28.277 --> 00:33:31.247
Yeah. Junichi played catch with him.

00:33:32.615 --> 00:33:34.450
Since your dad bought you
a baseball glove,

00:33:34.517 --> 00:33:36.319
- but never comes to play with you, right?
- Yeah.

00:33:38.221 --> 00:33:39.222
I'm sorry.

00:33:40.123 --> 00:33:42.391
I played catch
with Mr. Junichi's girlfriend too.

00:33:42.959 --> 00:33:44.360
- Girlfriend?
- Yeah.

00:33:44.427 --> 00:33:46.462
Junichi brought his girlfriend.

00:33:47.463 --> 00:33:48.431
I see.

00:33:49.365 --> 00:33:51.767
She was really cute, wasn't she?

00:33:53.836 --> 00:33:54.971
I guess so.

00:33:55.037 --> 00:33:56.038
You guess so?

00:33:56.973 --> 00:33:58.975
Apparently, they're living together.

00:34:00.009 --> 00:34:01.010
I see.

00:34:04.247 --> 00:34:05.781
Okay, let's eat.

00:34:07.517 --> 00:34:09.218
Thank you for the food.

00:34:09.285 --> 00:34:10.353
Thank you.

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:22.331
Do you like it that much?

00:34:22.398 --> 00:34:23.299
Yeah.

00:34:23.966 --> 00:34:26.536
I love the taste, color, everything.

00:34:27.737 --> 00:34:28.771
I see.

00:34:31.174 --> 00:34:32.108
What about you?

00:34:32.775 --> 00:34:34.143
- Me?
- Yeah.

00:34:35.077 --> 00:34:37.046
I like dried seaweed.

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:38.481
Dried seaweed?

00:34:40.249 --> 00:34:41.184
That's your favorite?

00:34:42.852 --> 00:34:44.220
I like it the best.

00:34:47.557 --> 00:34:48.624
Dried seaweed, huh?

00:34:49.125 --> 00:34:50.660
I see.

00:34:52.662 --> 00:34:55.097
Why did you decide to take me along?

00:34:58.901 --> 00:34:59.769
I wonder why.

00:35:01.737 --> 00:35:02.672
Do I need a reason?

00:35:04.507 --> 00:35:06.809
I had fun. Thanks for taking me.

00:35:35.938 --> 00:35:37.506
Was Masaki sleeping?

00:35:37.573 --> 00:35:38.407
What?

00:35:38.908 --> 00:35:40.776
Yeah. He's fast asleep.

00:35:43.312 --> 00:35:44.847
You haven't opened this yet?

00:35:45.448 --> 00:35:46.482
Yeah.

00:35:47.049 --> 00:35:49.852
I don't drink wine by myself
when I'm at home.

00:35:49.919 --> 00:35:50.920
You drink beer?

00:35:51.687 --> 00:35:52.521
Yeah.

00:35:54.423 --> 00:35:56.492
Keisuke, do you drink wine by yourself?

00:35:57.627 --> 00:35:59.662
No, I don't drink it either.

00:36:19.915 --> 00:36:22.585
Whoa! Oh no!

00:37:42.665 --> 00:37:43.632
It's Naoto.

00:37:47.036 --> 00:37:48.304
Sorry to come by so late.

00:37:48.371 --> 00:37:49.572
What's wrong?

00:37:49.638 --> 00:37:51.607
- Hey Keisuke.
- Come inside.

00:37:52.308 --> 00:37:53.476
Is that all right?

00:37:53.542 --> 00:37:55.878
Of course. Come in.

00:37:58.881 --> 00:38:00.282
I'm not here for any particular reason.

00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:02.618
I was passing by and saw Keisuke's car.

00:38:03.452 --> 00:38:04.920
You feel anxious being alone, right?

00:38:06.021 --> 00:38:09.692
Not that gathering together
will change anything.

00:38:10.826 --> 00:38:12.628
Should we call Junichi too?

00:38:14.563 --> 00:38:18.000
Junichi has a girlfriend he's living with.

00:38:18.968 --> 00:38:20.636
- They're living together?
- Yeah.

00:38:22.171 --> 00:38:24.106
- Did you know about this?
- No. I just found out.

00:38:24.173 --> 00:38:25.808
I just found out today as well.

00:38:28.177 --> 00:38:30.346
This happened before, didn't it?

00:38:30.413 --> 00:38:32.715
You felt that you were left out
and started sulking.

00:38:33.516 --> 00:38:34.517
I remember that.

00:38:34.583 --> 00:38:37.086
- You guys didn't leave me out on purpose?
- Of course not!

00:38:37.153 --> 00:38:38.154
You know, Naoto,

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:42.391
you probably forgot what you heard,
and ended up thinking no one told you.

00:38:42.458 --> 00:38:44.260
You're so mean, Maki.

00:38:45.127 --> 00:38:47.396
I'll message Junichi just in case.

00:38:47.897 --> 00:38:49.432
- You don't have to.
- You don't have to.

00:38:55.337 --> 00:38:56.305
Here.

00:38:59.942 --> 00:39:01.010
I'm going out for a bit.

00:39:02.311 --> 00:39:03.512
Mahjong?

00:39:05.848 --> 00:39:07.283
- Have fun.
- Okay.

00:39:13.088 --> 00:39:16.926
NAOTO SAKUMA

00:39:16.992 --> 00:39:18.561
I'm at Maki's house right now.

00:39:19.061 --> 00:39:21.030
Keisuke is here too. Want to join us?

00:39:25.134 --> 00:39:26.769
- I'll be off.
- Bye.

00:39:28.037 --> 00:39:30.339
- Do you come this way often?
- Yes, I do.

00:39:30.406 --> 00:39:32.475
Were you here two weeks ago
on a Saturday night

00:39:32.975 --> 00:39:34.777
at around 10:00 p.m.?

00:39:35.744 --> 00:39:37.780
- I always pass by here.
- Is that right?

00:39:37.847 --> 00:39:41.350
Do you remember if the light was on
at this hair salon?

00:39:41.917 --> 00:39:44.119
I don't remember that.

00:39:44.186 --> 00:39:45.955
I don't think I was paying attention.

00:39:48.023 --> 00:39:49.625
The light was on.

00:39:50.826 --> 00:39:51.694
You're sure?

00:39:52.728 --> 00:39:54.463
Since I'm a hair stylist,

00:39:55.064 --> 00:39:58.701
when I see a salon with the lights on,
I tend to wonder if they're practicing.

00:39:59.535 --> 00:40:00.870
- So it catches my eye.
- I see.

00:40:00.936 --> 00:40:03.405
Did you happen to see who was inside?

00:40:04.173 --> 00:40:06.308
I did see a figure inside.

00:40:08.577 --> 00:40:10.613
It was a woman, right?

00:40:10.679 --> 00:40:14.483
Well, the manager of this place
is a woman, right?

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:16.085
Yes, that's right.

00:40:25.828 --> 00:40:26.962
This is Nara.

00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:28.831
This is Tobina.

00:40:29.398 --> 00:40:31.133
What is it, Detective Tobina?

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.002
You're off duty today, right?

00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:37.540
Regarding Ms. Makiko Iwamoto's alibi,

00:40:37.606 --> 00:40:41.911
I got two testimonies stating that
the lights were on in the hair salon

00:40:41.977 --> 00:40:45.915
and that there was a person inside
around 10:00 p.m. on Saturday night.

00:40:45.981 --> 00:40:47.983
That's wonderful.

00:40:48.517 --> 00:40:50.252
Then good day.

00:40:59.361 --> 00:41:00.362
Um…

00:41:00.863 --> 00:41:03.666
Isn't it best to tell your buddy Tobina
about this…?

00:41:09.905 --> 00:41:10.806
No way, no way.

00:41:10.873 --> 00:41:12.041
- No.
- You did it five times.

00:41:12.107 --> 00:41:12.942
{\an8}No, I didn't.

00:41:13.008 --> 00:41:14.577
{\an8}Naoto, you should drink too.

00:41:14.643 --> 00:41:16.178
{\an8}But I drove here.

00:41:16.245 --> 00:41:17.713
{\an8}I drove here too.

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:19.348
{\an8}He can stay the night, right?

00:41:19.415 --> 00:41:21.383
{\an8}Yeah. Just sleep over there.

00:41:23.986 --> 00:41:25.220
{\an8}I got a message from Junichi.

00:41:25.287 --> 00:41:26.355
{\an8}What did he say?

00:41:26.422 --> 00:41:27.289
{\an8}He said he's coming.

00:41:28.324 --> 00:41:29.224
{\an8}Really?

00:41:32.828 --> 00:41:33.729
{\an8}Is that him?

00:41:40.202 --> 00:41:41.203
{\an8}What?

00:41:42.204 --> 00:41:43.105
{\an8}Detectives.

00:41:43.606 --> 00:41:44.506
{\an8}Good evening.

00:41:45.307 --> 00:41:46.508
{\an8}What brings you here?

00:41:47.676 --> 00:41:48.744
{\an8}Naoto.

00:41:51.947 --> 00:41:53.649
{\an8}You're all here.

00:41:54.984 --> 00:41:57.486
We meet again, just as I promised.

00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:00.022
Sorry for coming this late.

00:42:00.089 --> 00:42:02.558
Yes, this is absurd.

00:42:02.625 --> 00:42:04.493
Ms. Iwamoto has a young child too.

00:42:05.427 --> 00:42:07.663
Would you mind accompanying me
to the police station…

00:42:12.901 --> 00:42:14.403
Mr. Naoto Sakuma.

00:42:15.604 --> 00:42:16.438
What?

00:42:17.106 --> 00:42:18.874
There is something I'd like to ask you.

00:42:19.541 --> 00:42:21.276
What's going on?

00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:25.648
It doesn't take an hour to get
to your house from Haneda, right?

00:42:27.249 --> 00:42:32.154
Is it true that you were caught
in a traffic jam that day?

00:42:32.721 --> 00:42:34.289
I didn't get home until

00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:37.693
a little before 11:00 p.m.

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.094
Our investigation

00:42:39.662 --> 00:42:42.431
had quickly revealed that there was
no traffic congestion on either

00:42:42.498 --> 00:42:43.966
the highway or the local roads.

00:42:44.633 --> 00:42:45.668
So

00:42:46.902 --> 00:42:50.339
I'd been searching for sightings
of your car that evening.

00:42:53.275 --> 00:42:54.543
Then lo and behold,

00:42:55.044 --> 00:42:57.179
{\an8}on Saturday, the day of the murder,

00:42:58.347 --> 00:43:00.949
you and your car were captured

00:43:01.684 --> 00:43:05.354
{\an8}on the security camera at a gas station.

00:43:06.722 --> 00:43:08.290
{\an8}It was 10:05 p.m.,

00:43:08.791 --> 00:43:11.326
{\an8}as evidenced by the gas station's records.

00:43:12.628 --> 00:43:16.699
{\an8}It is about a ten minute drive
from the crime scene, Smile Sakuma.

00:43:17.766 --> 00:43:18.667
In other words,

00:43:19.468 --> 00:43:24.073
it means you could have been present
at the scene of the murder.

00:43:26.642 --> 00:43:27.643
Naoto.

00:43:42.257 --> 00:43:43.392
Nagai.

00:43:43.459 --> 00:43:45.094
- What's going on?
- Mr. Tobina.

00:43:47.096 --> 00:43:48.764
What are you doing, Ms. Nara?

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:52.801
His alibi has fallen apart.

00:43:53.969 --> 00:43:56.705
Mr. Naoto Sakuma will
voluntarily accompany us to the station.

00:44:12.855 --> 00:44:13.655
{\an8}IS HIS FORMER CLASSMATE
REALLY THE CULPRIT?

00:44:13.722 --> 00:44:15.023
{\an8}I killed my older brother.

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:18.193
I think he always had feelings for Makiko.

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:20.062
Please come right now, Junichi.

00:44:20.129 --> 00:44:23.799
{\an8}If one of us is lying,
who will you believe?

00:44:23.866 --> 00:44:26.301
{\an8}I thought you would never come back.

00:44:26.368 --> 00:44:27.803
{\an8}I saw it.

00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:28.771
