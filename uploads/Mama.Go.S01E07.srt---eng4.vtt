WEBVTT

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.920
I'm really not a scumbag

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:31.320
I'm not like that guy

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.200
But for reasons I can't explain...

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.560
I really can't be with you

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:36.079
But I really didn't play you

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.039
Everyone trained very well just now

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.439
Here's the plan now

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.159
Take a break

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:48.520
Review your technical moves

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.079
We'll do two more sets in a bit, okay?

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.840
Come on, dismissed, dismissed

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:52.920
Do some stretching

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.079
Xu Rui

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.920
Xu Rui

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.119
I didn't explain clearly yesterday

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.920
Listen to my explanation

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.879
I'm really not a scumbag

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:05.640
I'm really not a scumbag

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.280
Hey, student

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.640
I don't care what you are

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:09.159
Please don't disturb...

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:10.519
...our Xu Rui's training here

00:01:10.519 --> 00:01:10.879
Okay?

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:11.480
Please get out

00:01:11.519 --> 00:01:11.799
Xu Rui

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:13.599
I really, really, really, really like you

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.920
But there are indeed some circumstances now...

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.159
...that make it impossible for me to be with you

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:17.280
I don't want you to misunderstand me

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:18.000
So could you...

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.799
Hey, student

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:19.599
Listen to yourself

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:21.319
I really want to shoot you, I'm telling you

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:22.599
But I sincerely want to apologize to you

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.879
I'm sorry

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.040
Hurry up and get out

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.480
Xu Rui

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:36.159
Xu Rui, it's fine. This is a small scene

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:37.840
Coach can handle it alone

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.239
You don't need to pay attention to him

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:41.400
He... You... He...

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.200
No, you guys stretch your legs

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.359
Kong Xiaocan

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.400
I don't understand

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.120
Why you wanted to break up for no reason...

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:54.599
...and now want to get back together for no reason

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:57.000
Li Wai told me you have your reasons

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:58.640
That something big happened in your family

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.079
That you have a cousin to support

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:01.359
But you said...

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.120
...your mom took you and left your dad when you were little

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.840
Her family is gone

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.000
And you don't talk to your dad's relatives

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.479
Where did this cousin pop out from?

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.960
About this...

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.879
I swear to you

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.560
My cousin is definitely my flesh and blood

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:18.919
But there are things I can't explain

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:19.400
Fine

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.919
It's a bit complicated

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:20.639
Anyway, it has nothing to do with me anymore

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:21.639
Xu Rui, really, listen to me

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:22.319
I really didn't mean to...

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.120
Maybe you saw me embarrassed yesterday...

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.360
...and felt you had a chance again

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.719
But let me tell you...

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:32.120
...I will definitely meet someone better than you

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:35.199
Don't be so full of yourself

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.159
Every word I said is the truth

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.080
You have to believe me

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.520
There really are some inexplicable reasons

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.439
I beg you

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:58.000
Please

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.120
I'm begging you

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.960
Xiaocan

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.400
Look

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.319
Does Mom look good in this?

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:06.560
I'll wear this to register for school tomorrow

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:07.919
Nice. It looks nice

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.039
What are you wearing?

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.800
Let's match

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.759
A matching mother-son outfit

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:11.400
I'm fine with anything

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.960
I'll follow your lead

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:12.879
Follow me

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.599
Shoes. I haven't changed my shoes yet

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.520
Look

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.240
Look at Mom's shoes

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.240
I'll pick them up to show you

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.080
Look at this

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.800
Mom has treasured these for years, couldn't bear to wear them

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.120
Finally got a chance to use them

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:27.120
Pretty good

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.280
These work too. They look nice

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.840
Nice, very nice

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:30.840
There's one more thing, the most important one

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:32.159
The finishing touch

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.840
Look

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.919
This

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.759
Look at this silk scarf

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.879
When the time comes

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:40.639
Mom will hold this scarf and take photos at the school gate

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.400
Like this

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:42.360
Okay

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:47.639
If I take my eyes off you for a second

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.280
You turn the place into a tourist spot, don't you?

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:50.520
You absolutely cannot bring this

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.280
Tomorrow, it's either the scarf or me. Me or the scarf

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.960
You decide for yourself

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:59.039
Xiaocan

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:00.360
Hurry, take a picture of me

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.960
One, two, three

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.400
Like this

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.240
Is this side okay?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.479
Like this

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:09.719
Why did you actually bring that thing along?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.800
Give it to me. I'll put it here for you

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.120
Just stand there and don't move

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:13.039
Look at me. Look at me

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.759
Just smile

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.599
Nothing else

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:15.479
Just like that is fine. Smile

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:16.040
Smile

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.959
Okay, got it

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.879
My scarf

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:19.360
Forget it. Don't get it

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.240
Look, nobody else takes photos with that

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:22.519
Remember your current persona

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:23.639
You're saying goodbye to scarves from now on

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:24.560
It's either the scarf or me

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:27.480
But scarves are so pretty

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:37.279
Let Mom help

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:40.199
Remember this

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.439
I'll go report in a bit

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:42.519
You go handle your re-enrollment

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:43.839
I know, I know. Give it to me

00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:44.959
Don't forget to re-enroll

00:04:44.959 --> 00:04:45.959
I know, I know

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:47.160
Re-enrollment

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:48.920
You're so slow. Mom, you really are...

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.439
Mom

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.000
No, just... just...

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.079
Can't you lend a hand?

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:56.920
I've got it, I've got it

00:04:57.959 --> 00:04:58.439
Give this to Mom

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.560
No, what are you doing?

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.040
Is this moving house or moving the capital?

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:02.319
We live right in the city

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:02.759
It's not that far

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:03.480
We have everything at home

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.240
Don't waste the money

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:05.600
People just use couriers

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.680
I'll go get a cart

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.279
Need a cart! Need a cart!

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.680
Junior, here to register?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.600
Which department?

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.560
College of Agriculture

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.519
I know that place

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.160
I'll take you there

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:18.079
Here, let me help you carry this

00:05:18.079 --> 00:05:18.800
Okay, okay

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.560
Here, give it to me

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.920
It's fine

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.600
Thanks, thanks

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:21.279
No problem

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.319
No need, really. No need

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:24.199
We've got it covered here

00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:25.199
No need, no need

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.279
No need, no need

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:27.120
Put it down, put it down

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.160
Just put it down

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.639
Okay, thanks

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:30.199
Thanks, thanks, thanks

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:30.519
Bro

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:31.800
One thing

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:33.959
I was here first

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.839
Do you know me?

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.959
Ask around about me

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.000
That's my cousin

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:40.439
Stay away from her. Go

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:43.319
Come back

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.879
Tell your friends

00:05:45.079 --> 00:05:46.079
Stay away from her

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:53.240
Who is this guy?

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:54.360
Thanks, kid

00:05:56.519 --> 00:05:57.079
Thanks

00:05:58.199 --> 00:05:59.199
No, what's going on?

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:00.759
He was kind enough to help me carry it

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:01.639
Isn't that perfect?

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:03.600
Perfect that he helps, then you go re-enroll

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.040
What? Afraid your mom will get taken advantage of?

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:07.120
They're just a bunch of kids

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.680
Fang'er

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:09.600
You have to remember at all times

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:11.560
You are a son's mother

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.160
You are a mom. You don't...

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.079
Who are you calling Fang'er?

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:15.199
Don't give me that "cradle snatcher" stuff

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:15.959
Who are you being disrespectful to?

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:17.160
What cradle? What snatcher?

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.879
Go handle your re-enrollment now. Hurry up

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:20.079
Don't let me down

00:07:29.959 --> 00:07:30.800
Look at this teaching building

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:32.720
It's huge

00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:33.959
So many people

00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:35.480
Did you finish your re-enrollment?

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:38.720
Done, done, done

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.000
Freshmen, this way

00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:52.360
Freshmen, move inside

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.480
Report to your respective departments

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.800
We must study hard

00:07:56.079 --> 00:07:57.480
Can't slack off in college

00:07:57.639 --> 00:07:59.199
In the future, we'll either take the postgraduate exams...

00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:00.600
...or study abroad

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:01.959
Freshmen, move inside

00:08:02.079 --> 00:08:03.240
You can go report over there

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:03.800
Hurry up

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.120
Welcome, new students

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.319
Find your respective departments

00:08:08.319 --> 00:08:09.399
Sign in to report

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.199
Duxing U is a platform that empowers you

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.639
I hope you enjoy...

00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:15.199
...your university life

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:25.120
Lift your product up a bit

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.519
Alright, let's go

00:08:29.319 --> 00:08:30.560
Freshmen, move inside

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:32.919
Wei Mingtian

00:08:33.759 --> 00:08:34.840
Wei Mingtian

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.399
Retouch it a bit, let's take a few more.

00:08:46.399 --> 00:08:47.320
Okay, okay, I'll retouch it.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.200
Where's the heel?

00:08:55.159 --> 00:08:56.360
Excuse me, student, coming through.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.200
Tomorrow you'll really be a star.

00:09:20.639 --> 00:09:21.200
Look at this.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.679
These floor tiles are so bright.

00:09:23.159 --> 00:09:24.399
Look at our corridor.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.679
It's so spacious.

00:09:26.159 --> 00:09:27.320
Thank you, Auntie.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.039
Hurry up and eat.

00:09:28.519 --> 00:09:29.600
It's freshly cut.

00:09:29.679 --> 00:09:31.320
It's much tastier than the imported ones.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.440
Don't listen to their nonsense. Just him...

00:09:32.879 --> 00:09:33.200
Oh my.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.519
You're from this dorm?

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:35.279
Yes.

00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:36.360
I... Auntie will put it away for you.

00:09:37.039 --> 00:09:38.039
Student, did you come alone?

00:09:38.519 --> 00:09:39.360
Your parents didn't drop you off?

00:09:39.559 --> 00:09:40.159
No.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.200
Look how independent and sensible she is.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.240
I didn't ask you to drop me off.

00:09:44.919 --> 00:09:46.519
Look at you. Eat this. Stuff your mouth.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:47.919
Student, have a box.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:48.879
It's a specialty from home.

00:09:48.919 --> 00:09:49.720
Hainan jackfruit.

00:09:49.919 --> 00:09:51.360
Just peeled. This thing was freshly cut.

00:09:51.679 --> 00:09:52.519
That's what makes it tasty.

00:09:52.639 --> 00:09:53.159
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:09:53.159 --> 00:09:54.519
Tell Auntie when you finish it.

00:09:54.519 --> 00:09:55.399
Auntie will make sure you have enough.

00:09:55.799 --> 00:09:57.519
Thank you so much. You're too kind.

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:01.159
What's wrong with this child?

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:02.080
Is it your legs?

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:03.720
No.

00:10:04.159 --> 00:10:06.159
The heel just broke.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.159
It gave Auntie a scare.

00:10:07.159 --> 00:10:08.120
Auntie didn't dare say anything.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.960
Come, come. Put these on.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.879
Auntie brought them. Here.

00:10:10.879 --> 00:10:11.960
I'm so embarrassed.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.759
It's okay. They're new. As long as you don't mind.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.240
If you had Auntie's number...

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.080
And told me you fell...

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.600
Auntie would have come to pick you up.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.720
Mom, why did you bring these?

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.399
They're so ugly. And you're giving them to her?

00:10:21.799 --> 00:10:23.000
Ugly? These are beautiful.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:23.720
You don't understand.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.960
I think they look nice too.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:25.960
Thank you, Big Sister.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.480
You look younger than me.

00:10:33.639 --> 00:10:34.840
Thank you, Big Sister.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:36.679
Thank you, Auntie.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:37.919
Don't mention it. It's nothing.

00:10:38.279 --> 00:10:39.120
She's just young.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.039
She's young for her age.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.600
So sometimes she's not sensible.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.799
Please bear with her.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:43.519
You're in the same dorm.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.080
She's much more sensible than little boys.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.519
Look at my cousin's child.

00:10:46.519 --> 00:10:47.240
Making a fuss every day.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.720
Your cousin has a child?

00:10:49.799 --> 00:10:52.960
No, it's my cousin who makes a fuss every day.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:53.879
Not sensible at all.

00:10:53.879 --> 00:10:55.399
That girl is quite a handful

00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:56.000
Look

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.399
She was talking back to me just now

00:10:57.639 --> 00:10:58.279
She's pretty well-behaved

00:10:58.279 --> 00:10:59.440
That kid wet the bed in sixth grade

00:10:59.639 --> 00:11:00.360
Mom, Mom

00:11:00.639 --> 00:11:02.000
Mom, didn't you buy a ticket?

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.039
You're gonna miss it

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:03.519
Hurry up and go

00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:04.759
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

00:11:04.759 --> 00:11:05.519
Go on, go on

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:07.039
You guys, don't always eat takeout

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.159
Eat at the cafeteria more, that stuff is healthy

00:11:09.279 --> 00:11:10.279
Darn it, your WeChats

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.240
Have her send them to me later

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.399
Contact Auntie if you need anything

00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:12.840
Okay, okay. Sure, sure

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.080
And tell Auntie whatever you want to eat

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.759
This... this is guaranteed to be enough

00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:17.200
The fruit and stuff. Hurry up, Mom

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:17.919
Hurry up and go

00:11:18.159 --> 00:11:18.480
Goodbye

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.159
Bye-bye. Bye-bye

00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:21.440
What is it? What is it, Mom?

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.440
Didn't take my bag. Didn't take my bag

00:11:23.879 --> 00:11:25.159
Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye

00:11:25.159 --> 00:11:26.480
Bye-bye. Bye-bye, Auntie

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:27.519
Wrong way

00:11:27.639 --> 00:11:28.200
Bye-bye

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:28.799
Be careful

00:11:28.799 --> 00:11:29.639
Go to sleep early tonight

00:11:29.639 --> 00:11:30.360
Goodbye

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.679
Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:32.879
Oh my god

00:11:35.919 --> 00:11:38.240
I'm on a diet. This is really too sweet

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.000
Sorry

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.440
Girls, I'm gonna catch up on some sleep

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.000
I still have to livestream tonight

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.039
I'm meeting a senior later

00:11:45.279 --> 00:11:46.080
So I might have to head out first

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:47.120
Okay

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.440
This jackfruit smells so bad

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.799
I have a sachet here. Here

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.039
Thanks

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.639
I sewed it myself. Here

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.039
You're Xiaoyin, right? Thanks

00:11:54.039 --> 00:11:54.799
Thanks

00:11:54.799 --> 00:11:55.679
I'm Chen Xiaoyin

00:11:56.279 --> 00:11:56.759
Qi Zhuyun

00:11:57.279 --> 00:11:58.080
Xu Qian

00:11:58.759 --> 00:11:59.919
I'm Kong Guifang

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:00.679
Guifang

00:12:01.039 --> 00:12:02.440
You don't need to be so honest with my mom

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.399
Telling her everything

00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:04.840
You have to master the art of perfunctory responses

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.039
The art of perfunctory responses

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.720
For example

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.159
That's a bit too... you know

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.080
And also

00:12:12.039 --> 00:12:12.759
Really nice

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.000
And that one

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.879
It's gotta be you

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:19.879
Got it

00:12:23.399 --> 00:12:24.039
Oh my god

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:35.759
This...

00:12:36.679 --> 00:12:37.919
Young people these days...

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
surely don't use these floral sheets anymore.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.000
Th-This is just for padding things.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.159
I'll throw it away later.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.360
No, no, no! Don't throw it away!

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:45.720
This...

00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:48.240
I haven't seen this kind of sheet in years.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.600
This is too precious.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.440
Quick, let me take a photo.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.080
This brings back memories of my grandma!

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.600
This fabric, this pattern...

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:55.600
It's so hard to find nowadays.

00:12:55.679 --> 00:12:56.240
You keep it.

00:12:56.519 --> 00:12:57.159
Maybe in a couple of days,

00:12:57.159 --> 00:12:58.600
the school drama club will want to borrow it.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.840
They're pulling my leg, right?

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.080
I don't quite get it.

00:13:04.399 --> 00:13:04.799
By the way,

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.440
I brought a whiteboard.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:07.799
On this whiteboard,

00:13:07.799 --> 00:13:09.360
we can write all our names.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.919
Then we'll hang it on the door.

00:13:11.279 --> 00:13:13.000
From now on, Dorm 315

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.080
will be like a family.

00:13:15.159 --> 00:13:17.320
I see young people in TV shows doing this.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.240
That's a bit too... you know.

00:13:23.639 --> 00:13:25.320
My... my senior must be waiting.

00:13:25.399 --> 00:13:26.600
I... I probably have to go.

00:13:29.759 --> 00:13:31.679
Guifang, this... this is really nice.

00:13:32.799 --> 00:13:33.720
I'm gonna unpack.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.399
You're something else.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:37.919
I'm gonna catch up on sleep.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.000
Young people are really hard to understand.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:43.360
Bye-bye.

00:13:43.559 --> 00:13:44.159
Bye-bye.

00:13:44.399 --> 00:13:45.159
I'm leaving now.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:45.919
Bye-bye.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.559
Mom, I've finished my re-enrollment.

00:13:52.559 --> 00:13:53.320
I was just watching.

00:13:53.639 --> 00:13:54.919
You were way too... you know.

00:13:55.639 --> 00:13:56.360
Really nice.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:57.759
You're something else.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.759
Little brat.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:02.399
Alright.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.279
Go report to the department.

00:14:07.879 --> 00:14:08.559
Although

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.200
you've missed a lot of classes

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.360
and have to start over from freshman year,

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.279
I believe in you.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:15.799
You will definitely catch up.

00:14:16.039 --> 00:14:18.039
There's a long future ahead.

00:14:18.159 --> 00:14:20.120
A beautiful youth awaits you.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.960
Go for it, young man.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:22.600
Go on.

00:14:57.279 --> 00:14:59.279
Your dog has been standing there for two hours.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.000
He's not mine.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.080
Fine, stray dog.

00:15:03.879 --> 00:15:04.759
He doesn't deserve to be a dog.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.159
I'm telling you,

00:15:07.679 --> 00:15:08.399
this kind of guy,

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.039
who comes looking for his ex after breaking up,

00:15:11.039 --> 00:15:12.519
has no class at all, I'm telling you.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.000
Xu Rui.

00:15:14.759 --> 00:15:16.080
I'm here to say goodbye.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.440
You said if I still remember you in the next life,

00:15:20.159 --> 00:15:22.039
we must be together even in death.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.240
Cheers, cheers

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:35.440
Cheers

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.799
Bottoms up. Cheers, cheers

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:42.840
Waiter

00:15:43.159 --> 00:15:43.840
The shrimp I ordered

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:44.840
What is this you served me?

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:47.159
Sorry, I'm sorry

00:15:47.559 --> 00:15:48.759
It's fine, it's fine. Here

00:15:49.039 --> 00:15:50.000
It's on the house, on the house

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.080
Thanks. I'll add a special dish for you later

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:52.840
Thanks

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:53.360
No problem, no problem

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:53.919
Thank you, thank you

00:15:54.279 --> 00:15:54.799
So nice

00:15:55.879 --> 00:15:56.279
Boss

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.200
What's going on here?

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.799
You don't look so good lately

00:16:01.559 --> 00:16:02.039
No

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:02.639
I'm heartbroken

00:16:04.879 --> 00:16:06.360
How... how could you tell?

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.799
Your empty eyes

00:16:07.799 --> 00:16:08.879
Your haggard face

00:16:08.879 --> 00:16:10.399
You're either heartbroken or have insomnia

00:16:10.679 --> 00:16:11.759
You're definitely the former

00:16:12.279 --> 00:16:12.759
Both

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.799
Alright. We're closed tomorrow

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:16.919
I'm taking a day off

00:16:16.919 --> 00:16:17.879
You take a day off too

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.879
I've transferred your wages

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.240
Thanks, Boss

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.000
Wait. Boss, Boss

00:16:26.759 --> 00:16:27.720
You sent too much

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:28.559
Not too much

00:16:28.799 --> 00:16:31.159
You have school and a girlfriend to deal with

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:32.759
Everything costs money

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.679
Mostly the girlfriend costs money

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.480
No, we broke up

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:39.559
Thanks, Boss

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.960
Really, thanks for your help this year

00:16:43.039 --> 00:16:44.480
Otherwise I don't know how I'd have made it

00:16:45.759 --> 00:16:46.720
You caused plenty of trouble too

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:49.840
I... I...

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:51.440
Thank you

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:54.639
Waiter

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:27.359
So university classrooms are this big

00:17:29.119 --> 00:17:30.759
And such a huge screen

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.599
It can seat so many students

00:17:36.279 --> 00:17:38.680
Is this the ladder of human progress?

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.640
Is this the ocean of knowledge?

00:17:43.039 --> 00:17:45.359
Finally, I can choose the first row myself

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:48.880
Kong Guifang

00:17:49.599 --> 00:17:52.319
Today, this little boat of learning sets sail

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.359
You must steer it well

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:01.640
Nice and straight

00:18:04.359 --> 00:18:05.359
I'll save seats for them too

00:18:12.119 --> 00:18:13.920
A beautiful first day of college

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:14.759
Is about to start

00:18:23.119 --> 00:18:23.920
Is class over?

00:18:25.359 --> 00:18:26.519
It hasn't even started yet

00:18:28.359 --> 00:18:29.640
Why are you here so early?

00:18:30.519 --> 00:18:31.400
I came to save seats

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.319
Quick, quick

00:18:33.039 --> 00:18:33.599
Come sit

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.319
You're way too early

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:39.640
Fang'er

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.599
Next time, grab the last row

00:18:42.759 --> 00:18:43.440
Why?

00:18:44.039 --> 00:18:44.960
The first row is great

00:18:45.319 --> 00:18:46.359
Look, the teacher is right there

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.559
So the last row is better for slacking off

00:19:08.519 --> 00:19:08.960
Morning.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.359
Oh my god.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.079
You're wearing that to class?

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.720
Gotta stun on the first day of school.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.799
It's really pretty.

00:19:18.319 --> 00:19:19.640
We're in Agriculture.

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.160
Not the Fashion Design Department.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.640
Isn't your outfit a bit too formal?

00:19:24.759 --> 00:19:26.079
Speaking of that makes me mad.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.279
If my mom hadn't forced me to pick Agriculture...

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.000
I should have been studying Fashion Design.

00:19:31.279 --> 00:19:32.480
You don't like Agriculture?

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.039
Who likes farming?

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.240
Me.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.759
If you want to study design...

00:19:41.039 --> 00:19:42.960
our school doesn't have a Fashion Design Department.

00:19:43.119 --> 00:19:44.039
It's hard to transfer, too.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.079
It's best to go abroad to study design.

00:19:47.519 --> 00:19:48.960
Then you'd better start preparing early.

00:19:49.799 --> 00:19:51.119
Especially the portfolio.

00:19:51.119 --> 00:19:51.839
It's very important.

00:19:54.079 --> 00:19:56.400
I think our academic advisor is Professor Wang Mei.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:57.720
I heard she's super strict.

00:19:58.039 --> 00:19:58.680
Yes.

00:19:59.119 --> 00:20:01.319
I heard it's really hard to get into her grad program.

00:20:01.519 --> 00:20:02.279
Her standards are really high.

00:20:03.559 --> 00:20:04.440
At our school...

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.160
the internal recommendation rate is only 18%.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.640
No professor's grad program is easy to get into.

00:20:08.759 --> 00:20:10.920
But considering grad school this early...

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.079
isn't it a bit too early?

00:20:12.079 --> 00:20:12.720
Not early.

00:20:13.319 --> 00:20:14.400
It's all for future jobs.

00:20:15.359 --> 00:20:15.799
True.

00:20:20.519 --> 00:20:22.200
You guys know so much.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.319
Isn't this just standard procedure?

00:20:25.519 --> 00:20:27.200
It's only the first day.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.240
Why are you guys already so competitive?

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.319
Morning, students.

00:20:39.519 --> 00:20:41.359
I am your academic advisor, Wang Mei.

00:20:42.039 --> 00:20:43.039
I assume everyone...

00:20:43.079 --> 00:20:44.440
already knows a bit about me.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.039
So I won't introduce myself further.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.599
Is the beauty filter on? You're just snapping away?

00:20:51.599 --> 00:20:52.559
I won't be taking roll call.

00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:54.279
For the first Tri-Field Class of the semester...

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.000
let's go see the land

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.839
we will face together for the next four years.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:58.920
Let's head out.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:16.640
Let's go.

00:21:51.839 --> 00:21:52.640
Once you're over here

00:21:52.799 --> 00:21:53.759
Pair up

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.039
Stand in two lines

00:21:55.119 --> 00:21:56.079
Fang'er

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:56.920
Pair up

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:57.519
Pair up

00:21:57.839 --> 00:21:59.079
Where do we stand?

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.039
What's the matter?

00:22:01.079 --> 00:22:03.319
You all look so miserable

00:22:03.599 --> 00:22:04.559
Like you're disgusted

00:22:04.559 --> 00:22:06.240
Do you not want to come to the next class?

00:22:07.279 --> 00:22:07.839
Yes

00:22:07.839 --> 00:22:08.319
Yes

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.279
No way

00:22:10.839 --> 00:22:12.039
You still have to come next time

00:22:14.279 --> 00:22:15.440
Actually, think about it this way

00:22:15.799 --> 00:22:17.119
Nowadays, for ordinary people

00:22:17.119 --> 00:22:19.279
the fruits and vegetables on the table

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:20.880
the rice, flour, grain, and oil

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:21.759
are all things that you

00:22:22.039 --> 00:22:23.880
using the cow dung in front of you

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:24.680
have cultivated

00:22:24.799 --> 00:22:26.079
Doesn't that make you feel better?

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:28.200
Right?

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Just kidding

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.079
Soil is just like that

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.920
It will dirty our shoes

00:22:36.359 --> 00:22:37.720
It will dirty our clothes

00:22:37.799 --> 00:22:39.200
It will dirty our hands

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.160
But

00:22:40.799 --> 00:22:41.920
it also gives birth to

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.000
the food we rely on for survival

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.160
You students come from all over the country

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.319
After studying agriculture

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.960
you can take the skills you learned back home

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.839
and cultivate crops better suited for our hometowns

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.559
This is a very great thing

00:22:55.799 --> 00:22:57.680
And it's the meaning of studying agriculture

00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:58.920
Isn't it?

00:23:00.319 --> 00:23:00.920
Where's the applause?

00:23:05.319 --> 00:23:08.319
Alright, I'll officially start the class now

00:23:09.519 --> 00:23:10.200
Tri-Field

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.319
means experimental field

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:13.680
research field

00:23:14.359 --> 00:23:14.960
and high-yield field

00:23:15.279 --> 00:23:17.359
Now that you've all paired up

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:18.519
from now on, every group

00:23:18.799 --> 00:23:20.559
must take charge of a responsibility field

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:21.880
to learn how to plant

00:23:22.119 --> 00:23:22.759
rice

00:23:23.039 --> 00:23:23.519
wheat

00:23:24.079 --> 00:23:24.720
and cotton

00:23:25.559 --> 00:23:26.400
But for today

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.440
let's learn something interesting first

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.599
Today we'll start by learning

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:32.880
composting

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.759
This handful of nutrient soil

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.160
is as silky as black truffle chocolate

00:23:37.359 --> 00:23:38.440
Lightly rubbed between the fingertips

00:23:38.599 --> 00:23:41.359
it exudes the mellow scent of forest humus

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:45.519
Cow dung is the land's most humble gift

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.559
It carries the roughness of straw

00:23:49.039 --> 00:23:50.400
the lingering scent of soybean meal

00:23:50.759 --> 00:23:51.400
and

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.599
the tenderness after ruminant digestion

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.279
Water

00:23:56.839 --> 00:23:59.680
is the master of ceremonies for this feast of decay

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.000
Not the sloppiness of tap water

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.359
but the living water from mountain streams

00:24:05.079 --> 00:24:08.119
carrying the sweetness of moss and minerals

00:24:10.359 --> 00:24:12.000
The honesty of cow dung

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.160
the spirituality of rotting leaves

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.279
eventually all turn into

00:24:17.359 --> 00:24:19.119
the wriggling sweet scent in the nutrient soil

00:24:20.559 --> 00:24:21.880
The best fertilizer

00:24:22.279 --> 00:24:23.720
never lies

00:24:26.039 --> 00:24:26.599
Got it?

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:27.880
Get to work

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.559
Oh my god, you used too much water

00:24:41.119 --> 00:24:41.799
Such a big piece

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:46.559
A worm

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:47.519
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:48.960
It won't bite you, it's fine

00:24:49.799 --> 00:24:50.319
It's okay, it's okay

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:51.839
Don't be afraid

00:24:52.039 --> 00:24:53.400
Xiaoyin, give me a scoop of water

00:24:53.759 --> 00:24:54.240
Add it in there

00:24:54.319 --> 00:24:54.880
Add it where?

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:55.319
Okay

00:24:56.119 --> 00:24:56.759
Right, add it here

00:25:33.519 --> 00:25:34.079
Fam,

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.880
no stream today.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.559
If I'd known, I wouldn't have accepted the reassignment

00:25:37.559 --> 00:25:39.000
and just repeated the year instead.

00:25:39.119 --> 00:25:40.559
This major is a total trap.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:41.799
And it was my own mom

00:25:41.799 --> 00:25:43.799
who dug this four-year pit for me with her own hands.

00:25:46.039 --> 00:25:47.960
Does Xiaocan feel the same way

00:25:48.359 --> 00:25:49.559
about studying a major he doesn't like?

00:25:51.079 --> 00:25:52.559
"Lost Goose Notice."

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:54.799
This goose even has a name.

00:25:55.039 --> 00:25:55.960
Skyward Song.

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.319
This is the goose raised by our senior, Qu Xiang.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.759
It says there's a big reward for finding it.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.960
I heard this is basically her graduation thesis.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.119
For graduation theses in our College of Agriculture,

00:26:04.119 --> 00:26:06.720
you often have to raise pigs or ducks,

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.000
or grow some flowers and plants.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
If something goes wrong with them,

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:11.880
you might not be able to graduate.

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.000
Then what will the senior do?

00:26:17.119 --> 00:26:18.160
Let's go. Forget it.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:19.559
I need a shower.

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:36.440
It's decided then.

00:26:39.279 --> 00:26:40.160
We'll tell her when she gets back.

00:26:40.279 --> 00:26:40.680
Okay.

00:26:44.519 --> 00:26:45.680
What's going on here?

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:50.759
What is it? Sit down.

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.240
After a vote by the dormmates,

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:57.440
we have unanimously agreed

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:58.880
to elect student Kong Guifang

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.519
as the head of this dorm.

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.200
Hello, Dorm Head.

00:27:05.839 --> 00:27:08.440
How did I become Dorm Head when I wasn't even here?

00:27:08.559 --> 00:27:10.359
We're entrusting this glorious mission to you.

00:27:10.519 --> 00:27:12.559
We believe you will lead our dorm

00:27:12.759 --> 00:27:13.759
to greatness.

00:27:14.279 --> 00:27:15.599
On your first day as Dorm Head,

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.240
you need to go to the dorm manager

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:17.920
for a meeting first.

00:27:18.839 --> 00:27:20.079
Also,

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.400
from all the dorm heads in the college,

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.599
one will be chosen to join the Student Union.

00:27:23.799 --> 00:27:24.799
I know the Student Union.

00:27:25.079 --> 00:27:27.359
It's that student self-governance group, right?

00:27:30.599 --> 00:27:31.519
Yes.

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.599
Guifang, from the sound of it,

00:27:35.079 --> 00:27:36.920
you actually want to join?

00:27:37.759 --> 00:27:39.079
The Student Union at our school

00:27:39.079 --> 00:27:40.799
is pretty thankless work.

00:27:41.079 --> 00:27:41.880
Basically,

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.440
it just wastes your personal time.

00:27:43.559 --> 00:27:44.440
How can that be?

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.039
The Student Union is great!

00:27:46.279 --> 00:27:48.519
It enriches students' spare time

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.200
and helps gain social experience.

00:27:53.559 --> 00:27:55.079
Well, okay then.

00:27:56.039 --> 00:27:56.759
The meeting is at 8:30.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:57.920
Don't forget, Dorm Head.

00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:58.880
Okay.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:16.680
Senior

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.799
Someone's finally here

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:25.480
Slow down, slow down

00:28:25.799 --> 00:28:27.200
My legs are numb, my legs are numb

00:28:29.279 --> 00:28:30.160
Give me a sec, give me a sec

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.200
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine

00:28:32.039 --> 00:28:32.640
You're the one

00:28:33.119 --> 00:28:34.839
Remember to come to the Student Union meeting tomorrow

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:37.759
Okay, okay, okay

00:28:37.839 --> 00:28:38.480
Help me up

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.079
Sure

00:28:40.799 --> 00:28:41.720
Wait a moment

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.079
Let me catch my breath

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.440
Okay, okay, okay. Take your time

00:28:55.359 --> 00:28:56.279
Hello everyone

00:28:59.160 --> 00:28:59.960
Quiet down, everyone

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.039
Everyone is so quiet

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.640
Welcome to the Student Union

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:14.279
I am Cao Gang, Vice President of the Student Union

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:18.799
The Student Union...

00:29:19.039 --> 00:29:20.920
...is currently busy with the East Lake Jump event

00:29:21.279 --> 00:29:22.720
So we are short-staffed

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.599
I won't waste words

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.359
Since everyone is so enthusiastic about working...

00:29:31.519 --> 00:29:33.440
...we'll get to know each other on the job

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.119
And get acquainted

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:35.559
In my hand...

00:29:35.559 --> 00:29:37.400
...is the plan for the East Lake Jump

00:29:37.559 --> 00:29:39.279
Which student knows how to use this photocopier?

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:40.920
Student, do you know how?

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:41.640
I don't

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:42.319
This student

00:29:42.759 --> 00:29:44.680
It looks like the Neighborhood Committee...

00:29:44.799 --> 00:29:46.799
...uses the same brand of photocopier

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:47.519
I know how

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:49.680
Very good

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.440
Student, what is your surname?

00:29:51.599 --> 00:29:52.160
Kong Guifang

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:53.359
Student Kong

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.039
Please make copies...

00:29:55.279 --> 00:29:57.319
...one for each student here

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.640
And also teach those...

00:29:58.640 --> 00:29:59.920
...students who don't know how to use it

00:30:00.759 --> 00:30:01.400
You three students

00:30:02.279 --> 00:30:02.799
Learn from her

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:04.960
The rest of you...

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:07.000
...can continue with your work

00:30:13.079 --> 00:30:13.880
Is everyone this busy?

00:30:15.759 --> 00:30:17.480
If you want to scan, do this first

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:24.519
Enlarge this line and this line

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:25.480
The rest should be...

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:26.480
It's Xu Rui. Everything else is fine

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.119
Just print it directly

00:30:27.119 --> 00:30:28.480
She's also in the Student Union

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.960
Someone's at the printer. Wait a bit

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:39.240
By the way

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:40.519
That Kong Xiaocan...

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:41.920
...hasn't harassed you again, has he?

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.119
Let me tell you

00:30:43.119 --> 00:30:44.839
Don't bother with a scumbag like him

00:30:45.119 --> 00:30:46.559
Don't give him a single chance

00:30:47.039 --> 00:30:47.880
I didn't give him any

00:30:48.359 --> 00:30:49.279
What's going on?

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:50.799
What did Xiaocan do now?

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.599
He just changes his mind every second

00:30:53.759 --> 00:30:54.960
I really don't get him

00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.200
You guys try it

00:30:58.559 --> 00:30:59.400
You haven't taught us yet

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.799
Click this first, then this

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.000
I just want to know...

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.559
...how you two ended up together

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.880
They were together?

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.960
That was back in high school

00:31:13.519 --> 00:31:15.519
There was a monthly exam

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.359
When the teacher was grading papers...

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.240
...they found two papers with my name on them

00:31:21.039 --> 00:31:22.039
They checked and found...

00:31:22.839 --> 00:31:24.720
...that Xiaocan wrote my name...

00:31:25.319 --> 00:31:26.759
...on his exam paper

00:31:27.519 --> 00:31:28.960
Later, I asked him directly

00:31:30.079 --> 00:31:30.960
Who knew...

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.440
...he would just confess to me

00:31:32.599 --> 00:31:33.400
Saying he liked me

00:31:35.359 --> 00:31:37.000
Men's mouths...

00:31:38.759 --> 00:31:40.240
...are full of lies

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.119
Back then...

00:31:43.319 --> 00:31:45.519
...I thought he was quite sincere

00:31:46.079 --> 00:31:48.759
Who knew he'd be full of lies now

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:50.680
I really don't understand

00:31:51.279 --> 00:31:51.799
Scumbag

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:53.079
Huge scumbag

00:31:54.519 --> 00:31:55.119
Don't pay attention to him

00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.680
Kong Xiaocan lied to Xu Rui

00:32:00.759 --> 00:32:01.839
He's a huge scumbag

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:21.640
Xiaocan.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.799
Mom wants to talk to you about something.

00:32:24.559 --> 00:32:25.519
Did you fight at school?

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:26.559
No.

00:32:27.279 --> 00:32:28.200
It's about relationships.

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.599
It's exactly what I was afraid of, isn't it?

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:37.920
No, Mom.

00:32:38.759 --> 00:32:39.440
About this...

00:32:39.759 --> 00:32:41.160
Have you considered my feelings?

00:32:41.599 --> 00:32:43.079
I *did* consider others' feelings.

00:32:43.079 --> 00:32:44.440
You consider *their* feelings?

00:32:44.559 --> 00:32:46.279
Is anyone's feelings more important than mine here?

00:32:46.279 --> 00:32:47.359
Are you still my mom?

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.200
If you treated someone like dirt...

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.359
Of course I have to consider their feelings.

00:32:49.359 --> 00:32:50.279
What do you mean I treated her like dirt? I...

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.079
Did you deceive Xu Rui?

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.200
Wait, are you having a twilight puppy love?

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.240
What twilight puppy love?

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.240
Were you with Xu Rui?

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:55.960
And then you dumped her?

00:32:58.039 --> 00:32:59.519
Is it spreading around now?

00:33:01.079 --> 00:33:02.039
How is it being spread?

00:33:02.039 --> 00:33:03.079
So it *is* true?

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.680
No, no, it's not true.

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.359
There are many things I... I can't tell you.

00:33:08.359 --> 00:33:09.000
And I don't want to.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:09.640
My conscience is clear.

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.480
I'm talking to you about serious matters.

00:33:11.559 --> 00:33:12.799
Let me tell you, you can be a bad student...

00:33:12.799 --> 00:33:13.680
But you cannot be a scumbag.

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:14.200
Give that back.

00:33:14.599 --> 00:33:15.119
What is this?

00:33:16.359 --> 00:33:16.759
You...

00:33:25.839 --> 00:33:26.240
Kong Xiaocan.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.720
Is this the kind of life you're living now?

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.920
Yeah. Ever seen a scumbag work this hard?

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.160
You don't even have enough time to rest.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:33.440
I'm going to find a job tomorrow.

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:34.839
Go back, go back. This isn't up for discussion.

00:33:35.359 --> 00:33:36.759
What did we agree on in our three rules?

00:33:36.839 --> 00:33:37.799
You just focus on school.

00:33:38.119 --> 00:33:39.079
I'm doing fine.

00:33:39.079 --> 00:33:40.400
I only work the night shift at the BBQ place now.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.400
During the free time in the day...

00:33:41.839 --> 00:33:42.839
Isn't it better to earn some money?

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.119
Why did you suddenly mention Xu Rui?

00:33:50.559 --> 00:33:51.799
I was at the Student Union...

00:33:51.799 --> 00:33:52.920
And I ran into Xu Rui.

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.240
You got into the Student Union?

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:56.920
How did you get in?

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:57.960
Don't ask.

00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.480
I don't even know how I got into the Student Union.

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:01.960
The first time they elected a dorm monitor...

00:34:02.039 --> 00:34:03.079
It was because I wasn't there.

00:34:03.599 --> 00:34:05.519
Later I got into the Student Union because I *was* there.

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:09.679
You young people...

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.360
You're all too competitive nowadays.

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:12.840
Everyone is just a freshman...

00:34:13.119 --> 00:34:15.199
But already thinking about grad school or civil service exams.

00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:15.719
Everyone's like that.

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:16.960
Except for our major classes.

00:34:17.039 --> 00:34:18.119
Our major classes are actually quite interesting.

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:18.880
That's good then.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.199
Our major teacher...

00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:21.599
Is named Teacher Wang Mei.

00:34:21.599 --> 00:34:23.519
She's a big professor, a real expert.

00:34:23.519 --> 00:34:23.800
Really?

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.199
When she was about my age...

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:26.920
She had already published so many papers.

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:30.480
For the school, society, and the country...

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:32.239
She made huge contributions.

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:32.920
My goodness.

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:34.320
And her lectures are so interesting.

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.280
That teacher is so cute.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.079
Always smiling.

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.519
Amazing, amazing, amazing.

00:34:41.079 --> 00:34:41.920
I was talking about Xu Rui.

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:43.960
Don't worry about Xu Rui's business.

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.159
Young people have young people's business.

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:46.280
Can you just stop interfering?

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.480
I'm talking about serious business.

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:48.800
You are a man.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:50.559
If you want to be with someone...

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:52.079
You have to take responsibility, you know?

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.599
Xu Rui is a good girl.

00:34:53.599 --> 00:34:54.760
If you're wrong, admit it.

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.119
If there's a misunderstanding, clear it up.

00:34:56.599 --> 00:34:57.400
Did you hear me?

00:35:00.239 --> 00:35:00.760
Where are you going?

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:03.119
I've fully digested what you said.

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:04.559
So now I'm going to take a dump.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:19.920
Classmate

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.119
Classmate Guifang

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:23.960
Vice President Cao Gang

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:25.519
From now on,

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:26.920
just call me Gangzi.

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:28.400
Junior,

00:35:28.679 --> 00:35:29.880
Do you know where our school's

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.000
copy center is?

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:31.920
I know.

00:35:32.119 --> 00:35:32.880
The one next to the campus store.

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:33.880
Right, right there.

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:35.159
It's like this.

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.360
The East Lake Jump posters are out.

00:35:37.679 --> 00:35:38.679
I sent them to be printed.

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.000
But I'm busy right now.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:40.760
Junior,

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:42.400
could you pick them up for me?

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.000
Sure, sure, sure.

00:35:46.519 --> 00:35:47.000
Junior,

00:35:48.199 --> 00:35:49.920
buy me a water or juice too.

00:35:50.119 --> 00:35:50.719
Non-carbonated.

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:51.880
Okay.

00:36:07.559 --> 00:36:08.840
Junior, you're back.

00:36:09.199 --> 00:36:10.000
Thanks for the trouble.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:11.880
Here.

00:36:13.679 --> 00:36:14.199
Thanks.

00:36:14.599 --> 00:36:16.280
Senior, this was 8.50.

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:17.519
Will you WeChat me?

00:36:21.079 --> 00:36:21.440
Junior,

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.239
sit first. Please sit.

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:25.599
I'll transfer it after the meeting.

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:27.199
Everyone is here.

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.679
So let's continue the meeting.

00:36:29.079 --> 00:36:30.039
We need to identify

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.119
the key issues for a smooth East Lake Jump.

00:36:33.639 --> 00:36:34.480
So what is the key to the issue?

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:35.679
This junior,

00:36:36.039 --> 00:36:37.840
why does she look familiar?

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:40.159
Those with pens, write this down.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:41.960
Those without, use your brains.

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:44.360
Ruirui.

00:36:45.119 --> 00:36:45.960
Ruirui.

00:36:46.559 --> 00:36:47.400
Do we know each other?

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.159
Here, take this.

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:50.039
I bought it for you.

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:50.840
Hot milk.

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:54.880
No thanks.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.159
I'm not thirsty.

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.440
Take it, take it. It's good for you.

00:37:06.039 --> 00:37:06.920
Who is she?

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.079
Have I seen her somewhere?

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.320
Why can't I remember?

00:37:13.199 --> 00:37:15.360
With Xiaocan being so passive,

00:37:15.639 --> 00:37:17.199
what if I don't give him a push?

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.639
Mom has to step in.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:21.920
I really am amazing.

00:38:16.199 --> 00:38:16.679
Classmate.

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:17.480
This is my goose.

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:18.440
Please help me find it.

00:38:19.159 --> 00:38:20.840
Classmate, be sure to call me if you find it.

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.199
So cute.

00:38:39.199 --> 00:38:40.559
It's so cute!

00:38:50.079 --> 00:38:51.239
Hello, fam.

00:38:51.239 --> 00:38:53.599
Today is our ID photo day.

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:54.800
Here, let me show you.

00:38:56.039 --> 00:38:58.000
Yeah, the school is taking them for free.

00:38:58.840 --> 00:38:59.960
My buddies here.

00:39:00.199 --> 00:39:00.960
Say hi.

00:39:04.119 --> 00:39:05.960
And for the fam asking about the senior's goose...

00:39:07.159 --> 00:39:07.880
Haven't found it.

00:39:08.119 --> 00:39:09.719
I'm signing off now. Bye-bye.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:11.400
Did you guys know?

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:14.400
The senior raised the reward to 5,000.

00:39:14.679 --> 00:39:15.159
That high?

00:39:15.159 --> 00:39:15.760
Five thousand.

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.519
If the senior doesn't find that goose,

00:39:17.519 --> 00:39:18.639
she really won't be able to graduate.

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.239
How many geese could 5,000 buy?

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:21.800
It's definitely not just any goose.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.039
Maybe I should buy her one,

00:39:23.039 --> 00:39:24.000
and make a profit.

00:39:24.559 --> 00:39:25.679
You wish.

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:26.800
This thing of yours is unique.

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:27.880
I haven't seen you wear it before.

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.199
Just made it. Not bad, right?

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.679
You made it yourself?

00:39:31.159 --> 00:39:31.559
My god.

00:39:31.559 --> 00:39:32.800
This photo stays with us for four years. You're so handy.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:34.440
Of course I have to dress up a bit.

00:39:34.639 --> 00:39:35.639
That's amazing.

00:39:36.239 --> 00:39:38.039
Fangfang, didn't you bring any accessories?

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.199
I did, I did.

00:39:40.559 --> 00:39:41.000
Oh, right.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.199
Young people nowadays don't wear silk scarves.

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:45.960
This probably doesn't count, right?

00:39:46.719 --> 00:39:47.119
Wait a sec.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.000
This actually matches your clothes quite well.

00:39:50.559 --> 00:39:51.079
Really?

00:39:51.719 --> 00:39:52.800
I think braiding it into your hair would look good.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:53.440
Let me do it for you.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.079
Okay, sure!

00:39:55.079 --> 00:39:55.440
Come here.

00:39:56.679 --> 00:39:57.039
Will this work?

00:39:57.039 --> 00:39:57.679
Crouch down, Fangfang.

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:02.280
Don't you guys think this is tacky?

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.239
Not at all.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.039
Let me tell you,

00:40:05.159 --> 00:40:06.400
fashion is a circle.

00:40:06.639 --> 00:40:07.960
Now, this is called retro.

00:40:08.159 --> 00:40:08.519
Right.

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:09.960
If Xiaoyin says it's not tacky, it's definitely not.

00:40:11.239 --> 00:40:12.079
You wear it like this.

00:40:12.199 --> 00:40:12.840
Don't move, don't move.

00:40:26.119 --> 00:40:26.639
Xiaorui.

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:36.639
Okay, look forward.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:37.719
Look here, look here.

00:40:42.199 --> 00:40:42.679
Goose.

00:40:43.199 --> 00:40:43.800
What goose?

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.119
The... the senior's goose.

00:40:53.599 --> 00:40:54.480
Five thousand bucks.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:02.840
Fang'er, Fang'er, Fang'er.

00:41:08.599 --> 00:41:09.519
Catch it!

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:10.719
My goose.

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:33.679
Xiaorui, you flank that side.

00:42:01.199 --> 00:42:02.119
Thank you.

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:03.039
Thank you.

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.400
My goose!

00:42:07.159 --> 00:42:10.639
I can finally graduate!

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:11.800
Congrats, Senior.

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.199
Let's all take a picture together.

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:14.719
Let's stand over here.

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:15.880
The background is good here. Come on.

00:42:16.159 --> 00:42:17.119
Come on, Xiao Rui.

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:17.760
Stand here.

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:18.920
Stand right here.

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:20.880
Xiao Rui.

00:42:21.079 --> 00:42:22.639
We'll split the prize money half-and-half later.

00:42:26.039 --> 00:42:27.800
I... I just remembered something.

00:42:28.559 --> 00:42:29.440
What are you doing? Go in.

00:42:30.039 --> 00:42:30.559
Don't block the door. Hurry up.

00:42:30.559 --> 00:42:31.519
Is she the girl who was with Kong Xiaocan...

00:42:31.519 --> 00:42:33.000
...shopping at the mall?

00:42:34.119 --> 00:42:35.800
Is she that mysterious cousin?

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:37.440
Three, two, one.

00:42:37.719 --> 00:42:39.480
Cheese!

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:51.400
Fam, today I'll show you...

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:53.159
...the real life of our Agronomy Department.

00:42:56.159 --> 00:42:56.760
Senior.

00:42:57.559 --> 00:42:58.320
I heard from your roommate...

00:42:58.320 --> 00:42:59.880
...that you haven't been back to the dorm for over ten days.

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:00.679
What are you doing?

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:02.440
Watching over my graduation thesis.

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:07.000
This whole patch is the sweet potato seedlings I just planted.

00:43:07.199 --> 00:43:07.840
They just sprouted.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.199
Look at them. So fresh and green.

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:09.840
Over there...

00:43:10.079 --> 00:43:11.360
Th-that side hasn't sprouted yet.

00:43:11.679 --> 00:43:12.639
These are all my graduation thesis.

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.519
And there, way inside there...

00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:15.679
...I planted those too.

00:43:15.679 --> 00:43:16.880
That's also my graduation thesis!

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:17.360
Let me tell you...

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:19.280
...all of this is under my protection.

00:43:19.519 --> 00:43:20.239
I have to keep an eye on them.

00:43:20.239 --> 00:43:21.360
With people stepping and cars driving over...

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:22.440
...if my seedlings get ruined...

00:43:22.639 --> 00:43:23.519
...I won't be able to graduate!

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:28.480
We welcome students to apply to our College of Agriculture.

00:43:29.239 --> 00:43:30.480
If there's nothing else, I'm going to rest.

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:31.159
I'm watching my seedlings.

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:32.039
Alright, Senior.
