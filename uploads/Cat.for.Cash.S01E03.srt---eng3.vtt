00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:01.069
(Previously)
Did you change the cat food?

00:00:01.093 --> 00:00:03.561
Yes. Not only that, I
changed the litter too.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.003
But you know, cats are...

00:00:05.187 --> 00:00:06.649
I'm doing all this for a creditor like you.

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:08.818
Why are they all hiding today?

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.317
I think they're protesting.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:11.870
Jiro!

00:00:13.874 --> 00:00:14.691
Don't be so hard on yourself.

00:00:14.747 --> 00:00:15.899
You already did really well.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.246
You got a bunch of them back.

00:00:17.319 --> 00:00:17.981
Lynx!

00:00:18.026 --> 00:00:19.026
Jiro's collar.

00:00:19.101 --> 00:00:20.101
Jiro!

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.377
From now on, I promise.

00:00:22.461 --> 00:00:23.913
I'll take the best care of you all.

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:25.907
…do everything the way Mom did.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.010
Can you all give me one more chance?

00:00:28.437 --> 00:00:31.094
I help you run this café,
and in return, I get to be the cats' dad.

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:54.305
Finally, our son's putting
his good looks to good use.

00:00:54.881 --> 00:00:57.580
With that style, he must have landed
an executive job.

00:00:58.111 --> 00:01:01.351
Good, he can now stop living off his dad.

00:01:01.713 --> 00:01:03.917
What kind of executive
dresses so stylishly?

00:01:04.546 --> 00:01:06.946
I think he's got his eye on someone.

00:01:07.444 --> 00:01:09.516
Looks like we'll have
a grandchild to raise soon.

00:01:09.991 --> 00:01:10.991
Trust me.

00:01:11.498 --> 00:01:13.212
- He got himself a job.
- A sweetheart.

00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:14.592
- A job!
- A sweetheart!

00:01:14.664 --> 00:01:16.110
- I said a job!
- A sweetheart!

00:01:16.237 --> 00:01:17.343
- A job!
- A sweetheart!

00:01:17.373 --> 00:01:18.373
- A job!
- A sweetheart!

00:01:18.413 --> 00:01:19.413
- A job!
- A sweetheart!

00:01:19.475 --> 00:01:20.853
- A job!
- A sweetheart. Trust me.

00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:22.326
Knock if off, Pa and Ma.

00:01:22.403 --> 00:01:23.403
No need to argue over it.

00:01:23.532 --> 00:01:25.086
I'm starting a new job

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:27.483
with my potential future sweetheart.

00:01:27.792 --> 00:01:30.186
Whoa. What job?

00:01:30.354 --> 00:01:31.565
With whom, son?

00:01:32.142 --> 00:01:34.694
Once it's official,
I'll introduce that person to you.

00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:37.818
Now, I've got to head to work.

00:01:38.104 --> 00:01:39.104
I don't want to be late.

00:01:39.244 --> 00:01:42.313
Okay. Work hard, son.

00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:44.434
Told you, he's got a job.

00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:45.313
A sweetheart.

00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:46.407
- A job.
- A sweetheart.

00:01:46.472 --> 00:01:47.582
- A job!
- A sweetheart!

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:49.432
- I said, a sweetheart.
- No, a job.

00:01:49.611 --> 00:01:50.611
- A sweetheart!
- A job!

00:01:50.678 --> 00:01:51.623
- A sweetheart.
- A job!

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:52.949
Trust me. He's got a sweetheart.

00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:05.324
Jumbo.

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:06.889
What's up?

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.120
You woke me up this early?

00:02:36.553 --> 00:02:40.369
Ugggh… Jumbo!

00:02:42.172 --> 00:02:43.471
Just a sec, Jumbo.
Jumbo.

00:02:43.593 --> 00:02:44.593
- Lynx.
- Jumbo.

00:02:44.655 --> 00:02:46.150
- Hey, Lynx!
- Oh!

00:02:47.784 --> 00:02:48.674
Catch him!

00:02:48.767 --> 00:02:49.567
Jumbo.

00:02:49.692 --> 00:02:50.692
Jumbo.

00:02:50.901 --> 00:02:51.901
Careful.

00:02:52.325 --> 00:02:53.708
Jumbo.
Why are you hiding in there?

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:55.313
Hold on.
Hold him on.

00:02:55.531 --> 00:02:56.531
Jumbo.

00:02:56.717 --> 00:02:57.929
Why are you hiding in there?

00:02:58.414 --> 00:02:59.414
Jumbo.

00:02:59.482 --> 00:03:00.282
Stay put.

00:03:00.454 --> 00:03:01.454
Jumbo.

00:03:01.778 --> 00:03:02.778
Oi.

00:03:03.272 --> 00:03:04.272
Jumbo!

00:03:13.093 --> 00:03:14.379
- Jumbo!
- Hey, Jumbo!

00:03:28.102 --> 00:03:29.616
Come on, no sulking.

00:03:30.397 --> 00:03:32.443
Don't catch things like that again.

00:03:33.336 --> 00:03:36.070
Do you know what this little one of yours
brought me this morning?

00:03:36.934 --> 00:03:38.206
That means he loves you.

00:03:39.314 --> 00:03:42.308
Thanks for loving me,
but please don't show it that way.

00:03:47.023 --> 00:03:48.023
Wait, Lynx.

00:03:55.766 --> 00:03:56.855
There's still one cat left.

00:03:57.051 --> 00:03:58.085
No, I'm good.

00:03:59.037 --> 00:04:00.037
Come on.

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:01.069
It's okay.

00:04:01.103 --> 00:04:01.903
Come on.

00:04:02.055 --> 00:04:03.213
I can do it myself.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.090
Jumbo.

00:04:37.642 --> 00:04:38.642
Jumbo, my boy.

00:04:39.365 --> 00:04:40.365
Jumbo.

00:04:41.476 --> 00:04:42.476
Jumbo~

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.200
"Cat for Cash"
(Episode 3)

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:54.660
Luang Phor!

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:56.779
May I give alms?

00:05:59.946 --> 00:06:01.020
Is there a temple around here too?

00:06:01.044 --> 00:06:03.677
Normally, he receives alms at the market,

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.901
but the road's closed
for construction right now.

00:06:06.058 --> 00:06:08.023
I see. Please wait here a moment.

00:06:20.012 --> 00:06:21.705
Does your friend want to give alms too?

00:06:26.933 --> 00:06:28.117
There's an old saying…

00:06:28.444 --> 00:06:30.921
Making merit and giving alms together

00:06:31.385 --> 00:06:32.592
means being partners forever.

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:37.421
I mean business partners.

00:06:39.142 --> 00:06:40.142
May you be blessed with

00:06:40.416 --> 00:06:44.827
long life, beauty, happiness, and strength.

00:06:45.585 --> 00:06:46.385
Come out.

00:06:46.428 --> 00:06:47.294
Come out here.

00:06:47.427 --> 00:06:48.427
Come on out.

00:06:48.562 --> 00:06:49.615
Come here.

00:06:49.775 --> 00:06:50.633
Come here.

00:06:50.751 --> 00:06:51.751
Come out.

00:07:06.093 --> 00:07:08.221
(Oppa, saranghaeyo.)

00:07:19.535 --> 00:07:20.535
I'm the new staff.

00:07:21.484 --> 00:07:24.584
Please guide me, Mr. Lynx.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.461
That's my perfume. You like it?

00:07:53.244 --> 00:07:55.184
There it is.

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.818
Now I know why John Wick came over here.

00:07:58.904 --> 00:08:00.504
Your kid peed again.

00:08:01.222 --> 00:08:02.618
Don't frame my kid.

00:08:03.075 --> 00:08:04.306
He's a good boy.

00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:06.524
Maybe someone spilled something there.

00:08:06.888 --> 00:08:08.403
Then go smell it.

00:08:16.861 --> 00:08:19.090
Yeah, it's cat pee.

00:08:19.469 --> 00:08:22.369
John Wick, why didn't
you use the litter box?

00:08:26.482 --> 00:08:28.984
Did you change the cat's stuff again?

00:08:29.638 --> 00:08:30.838
It seems like another protest.

00:08:31.798 --> 00:08:32.798
Change what?

00:08:33.086 --> 00:08:34.415
Stop blaming me already.

00:08:36.375 --> 00:08:37.938
Your kid is a good boy, right?

00:08:38.941 --> 00:08:40.726
You're his dad, so you clean it up.

00:08:50.285 --> 00:08:54.696
(It's strange. John
Wick is never like this.)

00:08:54.867 --> 00:08:57.631
(Maybe he's sick.)

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.419
My mom used to make me
come here a few times.

00:09:06.989 --> 00:09:08.115
Then I stopped coming.

00:09:08.267 --> 00:09:09.067
Why?

00:09:09.185 --> 00:09:10.521
Uncle Vet here is scary.

00:09:10.836 --> 00:09:13.016
Not just cats, even I'm scared.

00:09:17.149 --> 00:09:20.210
Anyone who dares scare my kids
will have to go through me first.

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:22.596
Here, if the cats behave,

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.840
the vet won't be harsh with them.

00:09:29.759 --> 00:09:31.069
Hey, Dr. Pom.

00:09:32.463 --> 00:09:34.050
Hey, Lynx.

00:09:35.128 --> 00:09:37.676
Hey… who is he?

00:09:55.968 --> 00:09:56.968
All done.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:00.029
By the way, sorry I couldn't make it
to your mom's funeral.

00:10:00.133 --> 00:10:02.318
I was still studying overseas then.

00:10:02.459 --> 00:10:04.204
It's totally fine, Dr. Pom.

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.201
I only just found out

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.406
you took over your dad's vet clinic.

00:10:08.843 --> 00:10:11.323
Part of it is I was always
at your mom's café when I was a kid.

00:10:11.949 --> 00:10:13.815
When I saw the cats sick
and not feeling well,

00:10:14.216 --> 00:10:16.661
I wanted to do something
to help them recover and live longer.

00:10:17.247 --> 00:10:18.247
In the end,

00:10:18.694 --> 00:10:21.536
we both ended up as the second generation
running our family businesses.

00:10:22.801 --> 00:10:23.801
That's true.

00:10:24.674 --> 00:10:25.674
Sorry.

00:10:26.554 --> 00:10:28.212
Let me interrupt the reunion a bit.

00:10:29.639 --> 00:10:31.608
So what's wrong?

00:10:33.431 --> 00:10:34.231
Who?

00:10:34.417 --> 00:10:35.610
John Wick, of course.

00:10:35.819 --> 00:10:36.903
I mean you.

00:10:37.182 --> 00:10:38.182
Who are you?

00:10:40.762 --> 00:10:43.918
Ah, this is… Tiger.

00:10:44.489 --> 00:10:45.907
- He's…
- Lynx's business partner.

00:10:46.087 --> 00:10:50.101
But you don't look like an animal person.

00:10:51.897 --> 00:10:52.897
I like cats.

00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:54.819
I don't like dogs,

00:10:55.986 --> 00:10:57.243
especially Pom…eranians.

00:10:58.969 --> 00:10:59.969
Can I have your number?

00:11:02.198 --> 00:11:03.916
So we can stay in touch 24/7 if needed.

00:11:05.605 --> 00:11:06.605
Sure.

00:11:09.582 --> 00:11:12.199
Here. That's my personal number.

00:11:12.755 --> 00:11:14.877
It should be easier to reach me
than the café number.

00:11:15.022 --> 00:11:16.022
I've sent you my contact.

00:11:16.128 --> 00:11:17.351
That's my personal number too.

00:11:17.535 --> 00:11:18.335
Okay.

00:11:18.516 --> 00:11:19.516
Doc!

00:11:22.529 --> 00:11:23.619
Can I have your number too?

00:11:24.507 --> 00:11:25.810
The clinic number is over there.

00:11:26.217 --> 00:11:28.817
Please call during business hours only.

00:11:31.244 --> 00:11:32.510
Thank you for today, Dr. Pom.

00:11:33.455 --> 00:11:34.615
Do your best with the café.

00:11:35.296 --> 00:11:36.401
You've got my support here.

00:11:48.892 --> 00:11:50.912
Soft food, give medicine, monitor.

00:11:51.183 --> 00:11:53.207
Soft food, give medicine, monitor.

00:11:53.826 --> 00:11:55.915
Soft food, give medicine, monitor.

00:11:56.201 --> 00:11:57.984
Soft food, give medicine, monitor.

00:11:58.344 --> 00:12:00.436
Soft food, give medicine, monitor.

00:12:00.521 --> 00:12:01.715
Hey, Lynx.

00:12:02.922 --> 00:12:04.557
Have you ever given cat medicine before?

00:12:06.715 --> 00:12:07.801
What? Come on.

00:12:08.101 --> 00:12:09.943
It's just making him
take his medicine, right?

00:12:10.685 --> 00:12:12.616
I can just mix it into food.

00:12:13.413 --> 00:12:14.830
If it were that easy,

00:12:15.921 --> 00:12:17.310
cats wouldn't be ruling the world.

00:12:19.797 --> 00:12:21.395
You have to pry his mouth open,

00:12:21.971 --> 00:12:23.099
and pop the pill in.

00:12:26.349 --> 00:12:27.367
Pry his mouth open?

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:32.930
Easy-peasy.

00:12:34.029 --> 00:12:36.209
Just get his mouth open.

00:12:37.521 --> 00:12:39.899
But I should trim his nails first,

00:12:40.615 --> 00:12:41.747
just to be safe.

00:12:55.286 --> 00:12:56.286
Come here.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:12:59.590
- (Don't you dare touch me!)
- Ouch!

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:00.650
Lynx!

00:13:01.342 --> 00:13:02.342
You okay?

00:13:13.074 --> 00:13:14.074
I'm okay.

00:13:16.315 --> 00:13:19.115
I should wait until he's in a better mood.

00:13:19.616 --> 00:13:20.856
I'll give medicine to him then.

00:13:23.756 --> 00:13:24.756
Are you sure

00:13:25.724 --> 00:13:26.724
you can handle it alone?

00:13:31.064 --> 00:13:34.604
Want me to stay and help tonight?

00:13:36.614 --> 00:13:38.294
You can't even touch him.

00:13:39.245 --> 00:13:40.245
Just go home.

00:13:40.399 --> 00:13:41.406
I've got this.

00:13:46.798 --> 00:13:47.926
Can I have your number?

00:13:49.268 --> 00:13:50.518
Just in case something happens.

00:13:51.882 --> 00:13:53.103
Didn't you already have it?

00:13:54.786 --> 00:13:55.904
That's the café number.

00:13:57.654 --> 00:13:58.724
I want your number.

00:14:00.969 --> 00:14:01.969
Or…

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:04.507
do I have to become a vet first

00:14:05.794 --> 00:14:07.043
for you to give me your number?

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.060
Hey!

00:14:25.567 --> 00:14:26.567
Here.

00:14:27.347 --> 00:14:28.347
That's my number.

00:14:29.423 --> 00:14:30.520
You can call me anytime,

00:14:31.615 --> 00:14:32.744
no business hours.

00:14:41.631 --> 00:14:42.631
I'm heading out now.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.671
CAT DAD

00:15:17.836 --> 00:15:19.312
So what exactly do you do?

00:15:19.673 --> 00:15:22.019
Maybe I can give you advice.

00:15:25.112 --> 00:15:26.112
I'm in the…

00:15:27.859 --> 00:15:32.496
food and drinks sales business, Pa.

00:15:32.979 --> 00:15:34.218
Did you open a restaurant?

00:15:34.533 --> 00:15:35.809
Not exactly.

00:15:36.564 --> 00:15:38.203
What makes it more special is

00:15:38.876 --> 00:15:40.698
having staff to entertain customers.

00:15:41.425 --> 00:15:43.566
So, you've got like hosts and hostesses

00:15:43.736 --> 00:15:45.181
and customers pay for their company?

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:46.340
Yes, Pa.

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:48.603
The more they pay,

00:15:49.173 --> 00:15:50.821
the more staff will tend to them.

00:15:51.374 --> 00:15:54.103
Ahhh, I get it now.

00:15:54.686 --> 00:15:55.745
This is the kind of place

00:15:55.818 --> 00:15:56.886
I go and pay a lot at too.

00:16:00.704 --> 00:16:02.753
Uh I mean…

00:16:03.032 --> 00:16:04.801
before I met your mom.

00:16:07.298 --> 00:16:09.637
Places like this aren't hard to run.

00:16:10.169 --> 00:16:11.169
If you have time,

00:16:11.466 --> 00:16:13.451
I can train you and
walk you through everything.

00:16:15.398 --> 00:16:16.518
Thank you, Pa.

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:19.943
I'll go shower now.

00:16:20.132 --> 00:16:21.132
OK.

00:16:25.173 --> 00:16:26.546
Let's get you medicine, John Wick.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.149
CAT DAD

00:16:41.423 --> 00:16:43.271
Couldn't you think of a better
name to save yourself as?

00:16:44.569 --> 00:16:45.569
Why?

00:16:45.729 --> 00:16:48.221
You let me be the dad
of all the cats at your café.

00:16:50.566 --> 00:16:52.700
If there's nothing else,
I'm hanging up.

00:16:53.561 --> 00:16:54.591
Hold on.

00:16:56.888 --> 00:16:58.014
I want to see the face.

00:17:01.299 --> 00:17:02.400
Can you turn the camera on?

00:17:04.722 --> 00:17:05.979
I'm not comfortable doing that.

00:17:07.233 --> 00:17:08.575
I didn't mean your face.

00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:11.441
I want to see John Wick.

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:23.836
"I'm fine. I don't feel like eating,"

00:17:24.113 --> 00:17:25.633
"but I feel better than this morning."

00:17:26.367 --> 00:17:28.134
Did Papa scold you, John Wick?

00:17:28.548 --> 00:17:29.684
No, I didn't. Come on.

00:17:29.819 --> 00:17:31.602
It's your kid who keeps
hissing at me. Look.

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:32.810
No, John Wick.

00:17:33.363 --> 00:17:34.363
I've got to go now.

00:17:34.486 --> 00:17:35.958
I'm giving him his medicine now.

00:17:36.073 --> 00:17:37.073
Wait, Lynx.

00:17:38.383 --> 00:17:39.511
Let me watch too.

00:17:40.693 --> 00:17:41.809
I'm rooting for you here.

00:17:44.038 --> 00:17:45.113
What do you want to watch?

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.807
This is not a crocodile show.

00:17:49.179 --> 00:17:50.420
Come on, John Wick.

00:17:52.754 --> 00:17:54.236
Here you are.

00:17:54.881 --> 00:17:56.481
Swallow it. Come on.
Swallow it.

00:17:56.975 --> 00:17:57.975
(Let go of me!)

00:17:58.074 --> 00:17:59.074
- John Wick!
- Ouch!

00:17:59.251 --> 00:18:00.051
Lynx.

00:18:00.224 --> 00:18:01.224
Lynx!

00:18:01.285 --> 00:18:02.285
Lynx!

00:18:07.857 --> 00:18:08.857
Hey!

00:18:13.868 --> 00:18:14.868
Are you okay?

00:18:14.932 --> 00:18:15.932
I'm fine.

00:18:16.434 --> 00:18:17.844
You should be worrying about John Wick.

00:18:17.868 --> 00:18:20.009
If he doesn't take his medicine,
he won't get better.

00:18:23.166 --> 00:18:25.824
I'll hold John Wick

00:18:26.784 --> 00:18:27.816
and you pop in the pill.

00:18:27.896 --> 00:18:29.204
What about your allergy?

00:18:29.497 --> 00:18:30.497
I'll do it myself.

00:18:31.238 --> 00:18:32.238
Don't worry about it.

00:18:34.483 --> 00:18:35.483
John Wick, my boy.

00:18:35.693 --> 00:18:36.693
John Wick.

00:18:38.322 --> 00:18:39.415
There, there.

00:18:39.881 --> 00:18:41.164
Your daddy is here.

00:18:42.907 --> 00:18:44.126
Don't be scared, John Wick.

00:18:44.296 --> 00:18:46.923
There, there. You'll be okay.

00:18:49.289 --> 00:18:50.597
Good boy, John Wick.

00:18:52.473 --> 00:18:53.513
There you go.

00:18:54.858 --> 00:18:55.858
Good boy.

00:18:56.429 --> 00:18:57.429
You can go.

00:19:02.584 --> 00:19:03.584
How's it going?

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:06.606
John Wick had his medicine.

00:19:07.122 --> 00:19:08.225
He should get better soon.

00:19:08.405 --> 00:19:09.521
I meant you.

00:19:09.985 --> 00:19:10.985
How are you holding up?

00:19:11.284 --> 00:19:12.284
Any reaction?

00:19:15.827 --> 00:19:17.106
Just a little itchy.

00:19:40.552 --> 00:19:41.552
I'm okay now.

00:19:42.245 --> 00:19:45.190
If it gets bad, my eyes will turn red,

00:19:45.251 --> 00:19:47.402
and won't stop tearing up.

00:20:03.838 --> 00:20:04.838
They don't look red yet.

00:20:10.798 --> 00:20:11.921
I'm really fine.

00:20:12.834 --> 00:20:13.834
What about you?

00:20:14.281 --> 00:20:15.321
Are you okay?

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:17.910
Your face is red.

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:20.985
No. I'm okay.

00:20:22.673 --> 00:20:23.815
I'm serious.

00:20:24.716 --> 00:20:25.716
Do you have a fever?

00:20:31.655 --> 00:20:34.164
I knew it. You're burning up.

00:20:35.161 --> 00:20:36.161
What did you do?

00:20:42.166 --> 00:20:43.189
Maybe…

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:47.575
from bathing Jumbo this morning.

00:21:03.351 --> 00:21:04.351
Just put it there.

00:21:04.986 --> 00:21:05.986
I'll eat it later.

00:21:08.196 --> 00:21:09.876
Get up. I'll help you.

00:22:02.417 --> 00:22:03.827
- Take your shirt off.
- Huh?

00:22:08.402 --> 00:22:11.093
You're not in shape to take a shower.

00:22:11.827 --> 00:22:12.930
I'll wipe you down.

00:22:16.161 --> 00:22:17.380
No need.

00:22:23.341 --> 00:22:25.739
Then don't complain
when the kids don't listen to you.

00:22:27.481 --> 00:22:29.560
Fine, I got it.

00:22:30.363 --> 00:22:31.363
I'll do it myself.

00:23:16.659 --> 00:23:17.659
I'm done.

00:23:24.293 --> 00:23:25.403
Get some rest.

00:23:25.621 --> 00:23:26.824
Don't worry about the cats.

00:23:27.768 --> 00:23:28.768
How can I?

00:23:28.973 --> 00:23:31.493
- What if John Wick gets w—
- I'll keep an eye on him all night.

00:23:34.333 --> 00:23:35.495
I'm staying here tonight.

00:23:58.941 --> 00:24:01.922
(Are you gonna be okay
sleeping here with us?)

00:24:02.056 --> 00:24:03.196
I'm gonna be fine, Jiro.

00:24:03.693 --> 00:24:05.185
I already took allergy medicine.

00:24:07.216 --> 00:24:10.027
But can you please
keep your distance, okay?

00:24:10.173 --> 00:24:12.019
(Okidoki. Got it.)

00:24:16.631 --> 00:24:17.991
Does anyone know…

00:24:19.173 --> 00:24:21.637
why John Wick doesn't like
people getting close to him?

00:24:21.699 --> 00:24:22.912
(Jumbo doesn't know.)

00:24:22.985 --> 00:24:25.488
(But Jumbo knows
he already got his balls removed.)

00:24:25.644 --> 00:24:27.367
(Jumbo wants to have my balls removed too.)

00:24:27.482 --> 00:24:28.752
(That would be so cool.)

00:24:28.838 --> 00:24:31.118
(John Wick doesn't
really talk about himself.)

00:24:31.324 --> 00:24:34.419
(I heard he used to be a spy cat.)

00:24:34.628 --> 00:24:38.081
(But he knew too much and got hunted down.)

00:24:38.405 --> 00:24:40.210
(So he fled and came to live with Je Meow.)

00:24:40.284 --> 00:24:41.304
(That's nonsense.)

00:24:41.565 --> 00:24:43.477
(John Wick was an assassin cat.)

00:24:43.799 --> 00:24:46.532
(He once took someone out with a pencil.)

00:24:48.652 --> 00:24:50.800
Why does that sound like
a movie I've seen before?

00:24:51.949 --> 00:24:54.281
- So which is it, exactly?
- (Ahem. Be quiet. I'm trying to sleep here.)

00:24:54.305 --> 00:24:55.690
(Um… I'm going to bed now.)

00:24:55.715 --> 00:24:57.684
(Make sure you keep all the pencils away.)

00:25:03.705 --> 00:25:04.796
I don't think I can sleep

00:25:05.647 --> 00:25:09.415
knowing I'm leaving someone allergic
to cats to watch over the cats alone.

00:25:37.072 --> 00:25:38.072
At first,

00:25:39.704 --> 00:25:43.606
I thought it'd be the cats
who couldn't sleep.

00:25:45.453 --> 00:25:47.493
My mom used to sleep in here
with them all the time.

00:25:48.537 --> 00:25:49.910
Especially when one was sick,

00:25:50.534 --> 00:25:51.743
she'd hold that cat all night.

00:25:53.754 --> 00:25:54.754
That's nice.

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:56.920
When I was a kid,

00:25:57.808 --> 00:26:02.082
if I got sick, my mom would just
drag me off to get shots.

00:26:02.543 --> 00:26:05.318
Only with the cats, though.
She never hugged me.

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:10.298
Even when I was at the top of my class,

00:26:11.129 --> 00:26:13.094
she'd just listen while scooping litter.

00:26:24.698 --> 00:26:26.317
Who would dare hug you?

00:26:27.535 --> 00:26:29.517
You don't even let people touch you.

00:26:32.916 --> 00:26:34.416
Even cats choose

00:26:36.333 --> 00:26:38.016
who they let touch them, right?

00:26:39.804 --> 00:26:40.844
Like Dr. Pom?

00:26:48.104 --> 00:26:49.104
I mean…

00:26:50.628 --> 00:26:53.317
John Wick let Dr. Pom touch him.

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.112
Do you know cats copy their owners?

00:27:00.301 --> 00:27:01.687
What does that have to do with me?

00:27:01.762 --> 00:27:03.523
You're friendly with Dr. Pom,

00:27:04.125 --> 00:27:05.484
so John Wick is too.

00:27:05.579 --> 00:27:06.703
So you're saying,

00:27:07.584 --> 00:27:09.303
if I want to give John Wick his medicine,

00:27:09.932 --> 00:27:11.446
I should let you pry my mouth open?

00:27:12.637 --> 00:27:15.611
Well, we don't need to go that far.

00:27:16.797 --> 00:27:20.403
Just try to ease into physical touch.

00:27:23.158 --> 00:27:24.220
Start with…

00:27:26.117 --> 00:27:27.317
scratching my back.

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:32.050
The allergy medicine's wearing off.

00:27:34.184 --> 00:27:35.810
You're totally using that as an excuse.

00:27:36.945 --> 00:27:38.414
You just want to use me to do that.

00:27:40.624 --> 00:27:41.993
Ow, so itchy.

00:27:50.833 --> 00:27:51.833
Here?

00:27:55.086 --> 00:27:56.086
Ouch!

00:27:58.724 --> 00:28:02.014
It isn't just the cats,
your nails are long too.

00:28:13.843 --> 00:28:14.843
Lynx.

00:28:15.143 --> 00:28:16.143
Lynx.

00:28:17.187 --> 00:28:18.187
I'm just kidding.

00:28:38.012 --> 00:28:39.106
Trim my nails for me.

00:28:47.593 --> 00:28:48.818
I want to see

00:28:49.741 --> 00:28:51.387
if cats really copy their owners.

00:29:01.482 --> 00:29:04.202
Well then. May I?

00:30:00.238 --> 00:30:01.238
Did that hurt?

00:30:02.747 --> 00:30:04.718
No. I'm just sleepy.

00:32:19.231 --> 00:32:20.231
I…

00:32:21.168 --> 00:32:22.718
I'll go feed the cats first.

00:32:42.083 --> 00:32:43.083
Look!

00:32:45.287 --> 00:32:46.604
John Wick's eating now.

00:32:47.254 --> 00:32:48.616
The medicine must be working.

00:32:49.232 --> 00:32:50.285
That's a relief.

00:32:50.963 --> 00:32:52.003
Alright then,

00:32:53.157 --> 00:32:54.623
I'm going home to shower.

00:32:57.904 --> 00:32:58.904
Hey.

00:32:59.279 --> 00:33:00.279
Hm?

00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:03.803
You can shower here if you don't mind.

00:33:10.055 --> 00:33:11.306
I'll lend you some clothes.

00:33:21.021 --> 00:33:22.180
You don't feel hot anymore.

00:33:24.079 --> 00:33:25.330
Why are you being nice to me?

00:33:27.901 --> 00:33:30.428
W…well, you're helping with the cats.

00:33:31.033 --> 00:33:33.321
Why? Do you prefer me
raising my voice at you?

00:33:34.381 --> 00:33:35.381
Happy now?

00:33:42.749 --> 00:33:45.311
The Cold Prince is here.

00:33:47.033 --> 00:33:48.676
Hey, Tiger.

00:33:49.054 --> 00:33:51.003
Why are you here so early?

00:33:52.136 --> 00:33:53.597
I'm not early, Krapor.

00:33:53.987 --> 00:33:55.197
I just haven't gone home yet.

00:33:55.379 --> 00:33:56.379
What?

00:33:56.845 --> 00:33:58.523
You stayed over?

00:34:00.152 --> 00:34:01.560
There's a sick cat.

00:34:02.771 --> 00:34:04.313
So I stayed here and
watched over the cat with him.

00:34:04.337 --> 00:34:05.337
What?

00:34:05.564 --> 00:34:06.916
You stayed here with him?

00:34:08.490 --> 00:34:09.806
Not in the same bed,

00:34:10.299 --> 00:34:12.113
we just squeezed together on the floor.

00:34:12.241 --> 00:34:13.241
WHAT?!!!

00:34:13.334 --> 00:34:14.450
On the floor?

00:34:14.910 --> 00:34:15.910
Enough!

00:34:16.201 --> 00:34:17.935
Krapor is getting the wrong idea.

00:34:23.773 --> 00:34:25.061
There's really nothing going on.

00:34:25.445 --> 00:34:26.622
Come on. I'll walk you out.

00:34:27.217 --> 00:34:28.413
I've got something to ask you

00:34:29.442 --> 00:34:30.584
about the cats.

00:34:30.768 --> 00:34:32.928
But I want to ask you about
what happened on the floor.

00:34:33.043 --> 00:34:34.272
- See you.
- See you.

00:34:34.356 --> 00:34:35.156
Thank you.

00:34:35.277 --> 00:34:36.277
Have a nice day.

00:34:46.587 --> 00:34:47.587
John Wick.

00:34:51.177 --> 00:34:52.177
John Wick.

00:34:56.597 --> 00:34:57.597
John Wick.

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:00.630
John Wick.

00:35:12.493 --> 00:35:13.493
Is everything alright?

00:35:13.553 --> 00:35:14.724
There's blood in the cat pee.

00:35:19.842 --> 00:35:20.842
John Wick's?

00:35:28.299 --> 00:35:29.299
John Wick.

00:35:29.499 --> 00:35:30.499
John Wick.

00:35:31.171 --> 00:35:32.171
John Wick.

00:35:34.667 --> 00:35:35.667
Have you found him?

00:35:35.928 --> 00:35:39.432
Nah. I looked everywhere, even outside.

00:35:41.119 --> 00:35:42.289
This place isn't that big.

00:35:42.495 --> 00:35:43.516
Where else could he hide?

00:35:46.989 --> 00:35:47.989
John Wick.

00:35:51.213 --> 00:35:54.517
Jiro, if you were John Wick,

00:35:55.385 --> 00:35:56.385
where would you hide?

00:35:56.484 --> 00:35:58.700
In this house,

00:35:59.064 --> 00:36:03.501
there's only one spot that's truly safe.

00:36:05.311 --> 00:36:06.311
Lynx.

00:36:07.259 --> 00:36:08.708
Have you checked your mom's room?

00:36:13.411 --> 00:36:14.797
This door knob doesn't work right.

00:36:15.092 --> 00:36:16.493
It opens if it gets bumped.

00:36:19.593 --> 00:36:22.623
I haven't been here since the funeral.

00:36:23.813 --> 00:36:24.907
It makes me think of her.

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:30.720
Tiger.

00:36:31.098 --> 00:36:32.098
Blood.

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:37.070
John Wick.

00:36:37.673 --> 00:36:38.673
John Wick.

00:36:39.871 --> 00:36:40.871
John Wick.

00:36:41.456 --> 00:36:42.456
John Wick.

00:36:42.506 --> 00:36:43.912
Tiger.
John Wick's under there.

00:36:44.629 --> 00:36:45.629
John Wick.

00:36:45.845 --> 00:36:46.845
John Wick.

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:50.190
John Wick.

00:36:53.315 --> 00:36:54.625
Krapor told me this.

00:36:56.081 --> 00:36:57.617
My mom once found a cat at the temple

00:36:58.777 --> 00:37:00.017
while it was being attacked.

00:37:03.775 --> 00:37:04.775
Was that you, John Wick?

00:37:05.749 --> 00:37:06.967
It went under there.

00:37:07.107 --> 00:37:07.907
Where?

00:37:07.958 --> 00:37:09.252
Come out.

00:37:09.333 --> 00:37:10.373
Come out now!

00:37:11.603 --> 00:37:12.603
I'll be right back.

00:37:18.707 --> 00:37:19.707
John Wick.

00:37:19.774 --> 00:37:20.774
John Wick.

00:37:27.535 --> 00:37:28.625
- Come out.
- Get out of there.

00:37:28.657 --> 00:37:29.657
Come out!

00:37:30.633 --> 00:37:32.033
Where is it going?

00:37:33.089 --> 00:37:33.889
There.

00:37:33.946 --> 00:37:35.247
- Follow it.
- Where are you?

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:36.520
Hey! What are you doing?

00:37:36.679 --> 00:37:38.531
Hey! Hurting a cat
brings bad karma, you know.

00:37:38.998 --> 00:37:40.021
You'll go to hell.

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:41.544
Don't make me come at you.

00:37:42.128 --> 00:37:45.065
Meow, meow, meow. Come on out.

00:37:45.238 --> 00:37:46.734
You might get hurt if you stay there.

00:37:46.829 --> 00:37:47.865
Come here. Come on.

00:37:50.968 --> 00:37:52.305
I've got you. Ouch!

00:37:52.934 --> 00:37:53.934
Ouch!

00:38:00.648 --> 00:38:01.648
Ouch.

00:38:03.361 --> 00:38:04.361
Ouch!

00:38:05.828 --> 00:38:06.828
Ouch.

00:38:16.707 --> 00:38:17.744
Come here.

00:38:19.572 --> 00:38:21.061
I've got you now.

00:38:22.559 --> 00:38:23.701
Who scared you?

00:38:23.751 --> 00:38:24.751
Who?

00:38:26.409 --> 00:38:27.802
You're something, huh?

00:38:28.768 --> 00:38:30.808
I chased them all away.
Do you want to stay with me?

00:38:34.867 --> 00:38:35.867
John Wick.

00:38:37.708 --> 00:38:38.708
John Wick.

00:38:39.425 --> 00:38:40.642
You saw the monk, didn't you?

00:38:41.527 --> 00:38:42.730
It reminded you of the past.

00:38:44.857 --> 00:38:45.857
It's okay now.

00:38:46.778 --> 00:38:47.778
You're safe now.

00:38:51.061 --> 00:38:52.061
You're okay now.

00:38:52.796 --> 00:38:53.965
You're safe here, John Wick.

00:38:54.550 --> 00:39:00.821
♪ It feels so good now
with you by my side ♪

00:39:01.162 --> 00:39:05.786
♪ I'll hold you close, won't
let go, won't let it fade ♪

00:39:06.043 --> 00:39:10.901
♪ This warm and steady space you made ♪

00:39:10.973 --> 00:39:17.605
♪ 'Cause it's you, I found my home ♪

00:39:17.876 --> 00:39:20.057
Now we know the stress trigger,
it's easy to treat him.

00:39:20.649 --> 00:39:23.598
I think you should let him
stay over here today.

00:39:24.116 --> 00:39:25.637
He should be fine to go home tomorrow.

00:39:26.723 --> 00:39:27.810
Thank you, Dr. Pom.

00:39:28.752 --> 00:39:30.727
Ning, can you help bring the cat to rest?

00:39:30.811 --> 00:39:33.224
Got it. Come with me, John Wick.

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:38.417
Come with me.

00:39:40.747 --> 00:39:43.157
I'm going home then.

00:39:46.417 --> 00:39:47.417
Wait.

00:39:54.136 --> 00:39:55.136
I'm not done yet.

00:39:57.051 --> 00:39:58.571
Come sit over here.

00:40:12.512 --> 00:40:13.512
It might sting a bit.

00:40:24.812 --> 00:40:26.514
Don't forget to get tetanus shots.

00:40:27.137 --> 00:40:29.780
You might get a slight fever
after the shots. Don't worry about it.

00:40:30.381 --> 00:40:31.381
Okay.

00:40:32.143 --> 00:40:35.426
I thought you once
said you didn't like cats.

00:40:36.194 --> 00:40:38.902
Now you've got cat scratches
all over your arms.

00:40:41.072 --> 00:40:43.804
I saw how scared John Wick was.

00:40:45.181 --> 00:40:46.594
So I thought if my mom were there,

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:49.037
she'd do the same.

00:40:50.815 --> 00:40:51.815
Well done.

00:40:52.285 --> 00:40:53.618
You're really Je Meow's son.

00:41:01.438 --> 00:41:02.798
- Thank you for this.
- No worries.

00:41:14.403 --> 00:41:15.403
Hey.

00:41:16.235 --> 00:41:17.235
Hey, Lynx.

00:41:18.114 --> 00:41:19.114
We're back at the café.

00:41:25.161 --> 00:41:26.161
Let me help.

00:41:26.951 --> 00:41:28.684
It's alright. I can do it.

00:41:33.873 --> 00:41:35.005
Go get rest.

00:41:35.547 --> 00:41:36.804
You just got vaccinated.

00:41:37.593 --> 00:41:39.107
I'll take care of the cats for you.

00:41:39.774 --> 00:41:40.902
I can handle it just fine.

00:41:45.308 --> 00:41:47.002
When will you stop
being stubborn with me?

00:41:50.219 --> 00:41:52.408
I care about you no less than
the vet guy does.

00:41:53.471 --> 00:41:54.624
- Come on.
- Why?

00:41:55.057 --> 00:41:56.354
Do I have to scold you

00:41:57.582 --> 00:41:58.730
before you'll listen to me?

00:42:42.212 --> 00:42:43.212
Sorry.

00:43:13.201 --> 00:43:14.201
I'm sorry.

00:43:17.066 --> 00:43:19.207
Dr. Pom is like a big brother to me.

00:43:23.368 --> 00:43:24.906
He used to come by a lot.

00:43:25.304 --> 00:43:27.312
I'd always go to him when I need advice.

00:43:29.252 --> 00:43:30.516
But with you, I…

00:43:32.088 --> 00:43:33.455
I feel bad bothering you, I guess.

00:43:34.394 --> 00:43:36.111
If you let me be your kids' dad,

00:43:37.362 --> 00:43:38.946
then stop thinking you're bothering me.

00:43:40.224 --> 00:43:41.224
Understand?

00:43:56.388 --> 00:43:57.621
After finishing this,

00:43:58.220 --> 00:43:59.232
go lie down and rest.

00:43:59.685 --> 00:44:00.783
I'll take care of the cats.

00:44:48.744 --> 00:44:49.744
Please excuse me.

00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:53.220
You did really well today.

00:46:25.408 --> 00:46:27.006
Even cats choose

00:46:28.898 --> 00:46:30.513
who they let touch them, right?

00:46:32.301 --> 00:46:33.485
- Ouch.
- Lynx!

00:46:34.667 --> 00:46:35.667
You okay?

00:46:38.347 --> 00:46:39.365
Do you have a fever?

00:46:45.653 --> 00:46:47.697
I care about you no less than
the vet guy does.

00:47:21.377 --> 00:47:23.208
(Next Episode)
- Lynx. - Hi, Dr. Pom.

00:47:23.326 --> 00:47:24.644
I was just out running
around here with Gong Yoo.

00:47:24.668 --> 00:47:25.673
(Saranghaeyo.)

00:47:25.753 --> 00:47:27.634
(Here comes some refreshment!)

00:47:28.849 --> 00:47:31.415
You're all wet. Come upstairs.
I'll lend you some clothes.

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.211
What about that one? I think I can wear it.

00:47:33.333 --> 00:47:34.373
It's Tiger's.

00:47:35.293 --> 00:47:37.920
He might have a crush on me.

00:47:38.344 --> 00:47:39.675
Maybe you try copying cats.

00:47:39.858 --> 00:47:43.215
Only the favorite cat near you
will know when your scent changes.

00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:45.005
Why did you change your perfume?

00:47:46.322 --> 00:47:47.523
I like the old one more.
