=Episode 8=
(This story is purely fictional.)

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.300
Mr. Li Jr., are you sure
you don't want me to follow you?

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.550
No need.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.110
I shall walk

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.300
this path by myself.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.140
Hello? Anyone here?

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.860
What kind of place is this?

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:47.550
Waiter?

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.950
Waiter?

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.110
Four twos. Bomb!

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.740
Hi.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.420
Excuse me.

00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:02.580
Is this a private
restaurant run by Tengda?

00:03:03.524 --> 00:03:04.230
I've got this.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.860
Keep playing.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.420
Waiter.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.180
Can I get a glass of water?

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.990
Getting here was really a hassle.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.420
It was impossibly hard.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.390
Sir,

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.670
do you have a reservation?

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.860
You need a reservation for this?

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.990
We do require reservations in advance.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.230
But there's no one here.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.990
What for?

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.420
Who came up with that rule?

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.420
Our President, Mr. Pei.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.460
See the vegetable patch outside?

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.270
You can reserve seeds in advance.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.860
We grow them for you.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.270
Once they're ready,

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.990
they're picked and cooked on the spot.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.990
The same goes
for the seafood in the pond.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.990
That can be reserved too,

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.390
but you'll need to go over there

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.830
and choose and catch it yourself.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:43.670
Okay, okay.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.270
I just want some water.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.620
Unbelievable.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:02.670
I have the two.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.510
Your turn. You play.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:08.900
Just a small move.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.500
Hello, sir.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.140
(Waitress: He Huizhen)

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.860
Zhen, right?

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.990
How long have you been open here?

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.180
Less than a month.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.420
I've got to say,
the interior design here

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.990
is seriously impressive.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.940
It's got this strong
South American vibe.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.710
Very trendy, right?

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.860
South America. You know it?

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.860
I've done site visits there before.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.470
Mind if I add you on WeChat?

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.910
That way, next time I come,

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.191
I can book ahead with you, okay?

00:04:52.213 --> 00:04:52.860
Sure.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.990
I'll scan yours.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.740
Enjoy.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.300
I don't want coffee. I want water.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.990
We only serve coffee.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.180
No water.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:09.990
What is this made of, then?

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:12.940
Please scan the code.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:13.820
One eighty.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.700
(Welcome. Quick Pay.)

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.860
Lin.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.820
Is the situation confirmed?

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.670
Absolutely.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:28.860
Reporting now.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:29.940
Zhen, come here.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.180
It's all true.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.159
Someone tried to bribe me

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.990
to sell out info
about the private restaurant.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.670
Same here.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:35.420
Same with me.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.591
Someone approached me too.

00:05:36.613 --> 00:05:37.860
- Me as well.
- Me too.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.740
They went after
that many people for intel?

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.110
It takes real courage

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.550
to come forth

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.110
and to resist that kind of temptation.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.860
Alright.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.740
Lin.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.910
Give everyone an extra two thousand.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.300
Two thousand?

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.110
What?

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:55.910
Seriously?

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:56.550
He is serious?

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:57.230
By the way,

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.670
how much did they offer?

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.300
Five hundred for basic info,

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.910
and three thousand for key intel.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.860
Why have I never run
into such a good deal?

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.740
I mean,
we're already struggling,

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.620
and they still want to dig for intel?

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.300
Mr. Ma.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.990
No, listen.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.620
That's not what I meant, Lin.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.180
The point is,
what are they even after?

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:18.860
Mr. Pei, please rest assured.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.860
We would never
betray the private restaurant.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.420
Mr. Pei has treated us incredibly well.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.060
We'll keep our mouths shut.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.670
- Yes.
- Yes!

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.420
We would never
sell out the private restaurant.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.420
No.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.740
You must sell it to him.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.380
And the higher the price, the better.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:35.740
Push him to keep raising it.

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.740
Ideally, until he's completely broke!

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.990
Zhen, lend me your phone for a moment.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.740
I'm calling a meeting today

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.860
to explain to everyone

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.740
why I chose to place
Tengda's high-end dining business

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.420
at Mingyun Villa.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.420
It is because our target audience

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.180
is high-end clientele.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.500
That means we need to fully leverage

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.620
the prestige
and positioning of a private restaurant.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.180
And Mingyun Villa

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.500
is bound to become
Jinchuan's next core commercial hub.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.740
Listen to what he's saying.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:09.860
He's trying to replace me.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.180
I should slap him.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.300
I'll give him a real slap!

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.420
Mr. Li Jr.,

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.030
you were right before.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:18.300
High-end dining

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.060
is definitely the future.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.590
But this time,

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:22.860
Pei Qian is overthinking it.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.350
That land at Mingyun Villa

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.230
isn't going to take off.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.820
You told me
to infiltrate the enemy camp?

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:31.670
He dug a pond there

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:32.740
to raise seafood.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:33.990
And that place of theirs

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:35.500
is backed by mountains as well.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:36.740
No walkways,

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.860
just vegetable gardens.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.180
I'm telling you, when I went over,

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.180
there wasn't even a place to stand.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.990
But judging from Pei Qian's past moves,

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:46.990
we can't afford to let our guard down.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.500
This isn't as simple as it looks.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.620
So what is he really trying to do?

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:55.300
He...

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.740
(Taste and Prestige)

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.500
The layout is decent.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:12.860
By the way, Lin,

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.500
what were you about to say earlier?

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.620
Nothing major.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.420
Just a routine update.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.590
This quarter's total revenue

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.350
was only one eighty.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.230
Even like this,
we still made one eighty?

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:28.860
Here's what happened.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.300
A customer came by a few days ago.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.420
No reservation.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:32.860
He ordered a coffee.

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:34.140
An iced Americano.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.430
I charged him one eighty.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.070
(Li Shi)
Did he look like this?

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:43.190
Yes. That's him.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.230
What's going on, Mr. Pei?

00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:48.430
Don't tell me
he's the one snooping around

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:49.635
for private restaurant intel?

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:51.070
Look,

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:52.470
next time he comes,

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.020
put it on the house.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.110
Oh, right.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:03.140
Ma Yang and the others
haven't been here lately, right?

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.470
Mr. Ma hasn't come by.

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:07.860
I invited him a few times,

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.110
but he never replied.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:10.350
Probably too busy.

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:14.860
So they didn't give you any advice

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.470
or suggestions either?

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:17.860
No, nothing like that.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:20.230
Maybe they felt

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:21.860
there wasn't much they could help with.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:23.110
That's good.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:24.990
Lin, listen to me.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:26.620
Protecting Mingyun Villa

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.470
is protecting my dream.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:30.500
Chef Lin,

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.740
I'm entrusting that dream to you.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.860
The world of rich people is
impossible to understand.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.470
They're losing money
and still this happy.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.820
(Shenhua International)

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:36.740
(He won't let us work overtime,)

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.230
(but he always works late into the night.)

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:41.110
Any other ways to lose money?

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:44.620
Too bad this private restaurant
can't open branches.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.620
At least we've got
some successful experience now.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.990

Mr. Pei.

This time,

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.900
including failed games
from the late last century

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.380
and the early years of this one,

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.500
I've screened

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.860
a total of 4,826 cases.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.500
Please take a look.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.990
You've really exceeded my expectations.

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:28.860
Lin Wan, aren't you tired?

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:29.990
Not at all.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.260
You were right, Mr. Pei.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.740
While analysing past cases,

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:36.500
I learned a lot.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.110
I think the past

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:39.860
can reveal possibilities for the future.

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:47.110
Um...

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.380
Mr. Pei, I know
the private restaurant situation

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.260
has been stressing you out lately.

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.860
There's not much I can help with,

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.380
so I can only focus on my own work.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.110
Lin Wan, you must never get involved

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:00.620
with the private restaurant.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.620
Then, I'll get straight to the report.

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:04.740
Please take a look.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.260
Just from this case,

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.110
you can already see a lot of issues.

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:11.500

Congratulations, Mr. Pei.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.230
By opening the private restaurant,

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:53.260
you've finally
completed your first loss target.

Thanks.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.380
Your first bonus.

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:14.350
I thought you'd be happier.

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:18.110
It's just a small amount.

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:19.110
Nothing worth mentioning.

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.990
I'll keep working harder from now on.

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:43.470
I finally made money!

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:59.590

to becoming the richest man.

we can raise them.

everything on to Designer Liang,

Hi.

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.990
Mr. Pei.

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:40.660
Based on your concept,

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:42.540
the cost would be around this figure.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:43.540
That's fine.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:44.660
Son,

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.430
we don't need
anything that expensive.

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:48.140
Practicality is what matters.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:48.780
That's right.

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:51.380
Actually,
I've already looked into all this.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.230
Mom, Dad, if you have any ideas,

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:54.540
just tell the designer.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:55.430
Yes.

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:56.140
Alright.

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.780
I don't really have any ideas.

00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:58.780
I just think

00:15:58.780 --> 00:15:59.500
you've worked

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.780
so hard to earn enough for a home.

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.140
Your dad and I are really proud of you.

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:04.660
Yeah.

As long as our family lives together,

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.020
that's enough.

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:08.540

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:21.540
Okay.

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:25.660
How much is this going to cost?

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:26.230
Exactly.

Just plumbing,
electrical work, and doors and windows?

Nothing else at all?

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:39.950
Here's the thing.

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:41.540
What we planned before

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.020
was for the long term.

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:44.780
We'll just do what's urgent for now.

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:46.710
Alright.

Mr. Pei,

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:49.780
may I ask something bluntly?

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.620
Is everything going smoothly at work?

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.350
Yes. Very smooth.

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.020
That's good.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:58.620
Mine isn't.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:16:59.470
Goodbye.

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:03.310
Mr. Liang, don't be upset.

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:04.568
We can get them installed soon!

00:17:04.591 --> 00:17:05.500
Soon...

00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:14.990
Now you have two choices.

00:17:14.991 --> 00:17:17.168
Go big with the renovation,
and default on payments.

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:18.990
Or don't default,

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:20.230
and live in an empty shell.

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.950
Looks like my attitude wasn't right.

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:27.724
I thought I could
lose once and walk away.

00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:29.020
Now it's clear

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.390
I need to keep losing money

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:32.500
and shrink Tengda down to nothing.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:40.540
Mr. Pei.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:43.100
Mr. Pei?

00:17:56.257 --> 00:17:59.020
Since the restaurant opened,
Mr. Pei has been rarely in the office.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:00.780
I don't even know who to show

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.020
my failed game case studies to.

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:03.780
I still need to brief him

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.740
on the web novel platform's progress.

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:07.430
You made progress?

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:08.580
I don't.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:09.870
It's why I need to talk to him.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.390
No progress still needs reporting.

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:12.820
Maybe the boss has ideas.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.613
It'd be too late to wait for him to ask.

I sent the internet cafe branch plan.

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:37.300
Did you look at it?

00:18:38.168 --> 00:18:40.391
I've been pretty busy lately.
Haven't had time yet.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.780
What are you up to?
You haven't even been going to work.

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:44.340
I'm working from home.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.100
Skipping work is skipping work.

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:47.100
Working from home?

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.710
I'm telling you, people out there are
already copying our model.

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:50.950
We need to open branches fast,

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:51.630
build a chain,

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:52.740
and grab the advantage.

00:18:52.746 --> 00:18:53.502
Perfect timing too.

00:18:53.546 --> 00:18:54.950
Didn't Chen Lei and those guys

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:56.340
form a group on that show?

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:57.470
Let's have them

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:58.740
do appearances at the branches,

00:18:58.740 --> 00:18:59.870
and rake in the cash.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.390
That won't work.

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:03.470
We can't do chains.

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:04.768
If branches were possible,

00:19:04.768 --> 00:19:06.870
my private restaurant
would've opened hundreds already.

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.346
Private restaurants don't make money,

00:19:08.368 --> 00:19:09.457
so you can't expand them.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.190
But if you open
a few more internet cafes,

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.910
I could

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:13.390
buy the place next door outright.

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:14.710
We could live next to each other.

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:20.870
You can already buy a place in full?

00:19:21.346 --> 00:19:23.540
I was thinking of buying homes
for my whole family.

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:24.990

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:20.540
Mr. Pei, hear me out.

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.060
We know you don't read digital files,

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:23.710
so...

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:26.060
You haven't been to the office lately,

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:26.902
and about that idea

00:20:26.902 --> 00:20:28.368
for entering the web fiction space,

00:20:28.368 --> 00:20:29.710
I refined it further.

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:32.580
That's very detailed.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:34.950
Watch the foot.

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:35.430
It's okay.

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:37.630
I also revisited the failed game cases.

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:38.950
I analysed them

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:40.150
and put them into writing.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:43.870
You even added an index.

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:45.190
Yes.

00:20:45.724 --> 00:20:47.368
What she put together was so heavy

00:20:47.391 --> 00:20:48.630
that she couldn't even carry it.

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:49.780
We brought it together.

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:51.780
While organising everything,

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.670
I discussed it with Bao and Lv.

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.150
We all got a lot out of it.

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:56.870
Let me walk you through it in detail.

00:20:58.470 --> 00:20:59.430
Today's not a good time.

00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:00.300
Maybe next time.

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:01.950
Sorry, Mr. Pei.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.390
We'll head off then.

00:21:04.613 --> 00:21:05.910
Thanks for your hard work.

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:10.710
I have my own place.

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:12.150
At least hear me out.

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:12.910
Delivery.

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:14.580
Your food delivery is here.

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:15.820
Coming.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.060
What's going on?

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.380
(Shenhua International)

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:30.780
What are you doing?

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:31.924
This is still someone else's

00:21:31.968 --> 00:21:33.540
hard-earned work.

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.390
That young lady

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:36.150
analyzed over 30 years of game data

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:37.580
to produce that report.

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:39.740
What, feeling soft now?

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:41.820
She's efficient, capable,

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:43.870
and she's got a dad
ready to throw money at her.

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:45.710
If you can't
bring yourself to be ruthless,

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:46.710
just wait.

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:48.910
There'll be plenty more surprises ahead.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:49.950
And this one too.

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:51.060
Huang Sibo

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:52.457
wrote tens of thousands of words,

00:21:52.502 --> 00:21:54.820
analyzing the future
of the web fiction market.

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.950
With that talent for making things up,

00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:58.780
he'd probably
do great at writing novels too.

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:00.870
Ma Yang too.

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:02.020
He's dead set on

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:03.470
opening M&Y Internet Cafe branches

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:05.190
to buy homes for a family of eight.

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:07.060
None of them is sitting still anymore.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:08.340
They need to be reined in.

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:11.190
Don't rush.

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:13.820
I've already mapped out a combo plan.

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:17.260
First, we run losses on multiple fronts.

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:18.020
Second,

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:20.020
we flip management logic on its head

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:22.470
and divide them up
to deal with them one by one.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.620
(Leadership means
putting the right people)

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:26.430
(in the right roles,)

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:28.580
(building proper incentive systems)

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:30.480
(MBA Personnel Strategy)
(and using them well.)

00:22:30.502 --> 00:22:31.591
(Wrong ones in the wrong roles.)

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:34.470
Let's congratulate Bao Xu

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:35.340
for winning

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:37.580
second place in Tengda's
Best Employee Award again.

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:38.580
No, Mr. Pei.

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:39.870
I just got back this month.

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:41.340
I haven't done anything yet.

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:43.870
This award was voted by everyone.

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:45.300
You can't really turn it down.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:47.060
But I've traveled all over the country.

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:48.340
Then go abroad.

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:49.390
Learn from overseas teams

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:50.990
how they make games.

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:53.391
Learn from their strengths
and beat them at their own game.

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:54.780
Go apply for a visa.

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:55.580
No, Mr. Pei.

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:56.580
I think this opportunity

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:57.950
should be given to others.

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:00.300
Mr. Pei! Mr. Pei!

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:03.340
(When selecting talent,
focus on strengths,)

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:04.300
(not weaknesses.)

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.190
(Make use
of each person's unique abilities)

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:08.020
(and assign
responsibilities accordingly.)

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:10.380
(Hire without rigid rules.
Mismatch roles and ability.)

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:12.260
Let's congratulate Mr. Ma

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:13.950
on receiving the Dream Fund.

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:16.820
I won this award.

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:18.080
First, I want to thank Mr. Pei.

00:23:18.102 --> 00:23:18.870
He has real vision.

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:19.580
Mr. Ma,

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:21.390
save the thanks for later.

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:23.670
What do you plan to do
with the Dream Fund?

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:26.150
Honestly, I still want
to open an M&Y Internet Cafe,

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:27.190
another branch.

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.710
Mr. Ma,

00:23:27.768 --> 00:23:29.630
M&Y Internet Cafe is
just your starting point,

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:30.670
not your endgame.

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:31.710
I'm giving you three days

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:33.950
to hand full control
of M&Y Internet Cafe to Zhang Yuan.

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:36.190
I think you should use the Dream Fund

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:37.710
to incubate more possibilities,

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:39.060
and back more founders.

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:41.190
Keep pushing. Create new highs.

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.670
Why?

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:43.150
Why?

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:47.390
(The minnow effect,
also known as the leader fish theory.)

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:49.430
(German zoologist Horst)

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:51.820
(observed an interesting phenomenon.)

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:53.910
(Minnows are small and weak,)

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:55.260
(so they tend to move in groups,)

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:58.340
(naturally following
the strongest as a leader.)

00:23:58.368 --> 00:23:59.724
(Follow strong leadership.)
(They follow it blindly.)

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:01.140
(Isolate strong leadership.)

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:04.260
Sibo,

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:05.910
I've made up my mind about building

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:07.150
the web fiction platform.

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:08.340
We can't just copy

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:09.870
the playbooks of successful sites.

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:10.820
What we need

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:13.150
is to break
the mould and go our own way.

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:15.230
That does mean real innovation.

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:17.390
Mr. Pei,
I'll give it everything I've got

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:18.230
to make

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:20.670
this not-yet-named platform a success.

00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:22.260
- Okay.
- You've got this.

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:24.670
(You never realize)

00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:26.768
(how powerful a leader can be
when they understand)

00:24:26.768 --> 00:24:27.630
(hiring principles.)

(If you want people to take initiative,)

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:32.340
(let them choose work they actually enjoy.)

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:34.740
(Make employees do what they hate.)

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:35.740
Congratulations.

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:36.670
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:37.740
Lin Wan,

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:40.430
what kind of games
do you dislike the most?

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:43.710
Mr. Pei, I don't want to travel.

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:45.390
It's fine. Go on.

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:47.910
If I really have to say,

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:49.390
Soulslike games.

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:50.820
Good.

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:53.340
Then, we'll make a Soulslike game.

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:55.990
Mr. Pei, Wan, you guys
take a photo together.

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:37.820
Qian,

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:39.470
you're really moving in?

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:41.910
You said you'd move, so you did.

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:44.470
The corridor isn't even finished yet.

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:45.870
Why the rush?

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:49.230
The bedroom

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.780
is not done either.

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:54.020
Oh my god.

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:55.780
The living room isn't done either.

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:58.150
Qian, there isn't
even a door in this place.

00:25:58.540 --> 00:25:59.710
Are you living in a doorway?

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:01.820
The visual makes the space feel bigger.

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:02.870
Do you even get it?

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:04.768
You get bigger space
by living in a bare unit?

00:26:04.813 --> 00:26:05.780
Seriously, Qian?

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:09.230
This is called a grey palette.

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:10.780
It looks premium.

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:12.190
Premium, get it?

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:13.470
It's very trendy right now.

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:14.870
I can see the color.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.260
It's dusty.

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:23.500
What's this?

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:25.300
A tent?

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:27.100
Sleeping in a tent in a bare flat?

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:28.540
Qian, this is performance art!

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:29.950
This is called

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:32.470
back to basics, letting go.

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:33.780
It's a state of mind.

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:36.150
I understand you're confused.

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:39.820
I give up.

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:41.710
I'll just buy a fully furnished place.

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:43.020
I'm not living next door to you.

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:44.390
Don't feel bad about it.

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:52.100
Qian,

00:26:52.368 --> 00:26:54.630
why did you let
Zhang Yuan handle the internet cafes?

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:55.780
Remember what I said about

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:57.540
opening branches for M&Y Internet Cafe?

00:26:57.780 --> 00:26:59.910
Reconsider the plan.
It'll definitely make money.

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.780
Ma Yang,

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:01.524
I've always felt

00:27:01.524 --> 00:27:02.968
that putting you in charge of that

00:27:03.013 --> 00:27:04.100
was a waste of your talent.

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:06.470
Someone as capable as you

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.035
shouldn't be boxed in

00:27:08.035 --> 00:27:09.150
by a small internet cafe.

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:11.230
You belong on a bigger stage.

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:12.780
A bigger stage?

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:14.340
What kind of stage?

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:15.780
I haven't figured it out yet.

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:17.190
Once I make it up, I'll tell you.

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:18.710
Make it up?

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:20.500
Qian,

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.740
are you coding
a whole new platform for me?

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:25.950
Yes, totally.

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.190
You've had a long day too.

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.190
Once you're done,
head home and get some rest.

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:31.340
I'll tell you when it's ready.

00:27:31.346 --> 00:27:32.013
I'm not tired.

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:33.910
I'll help you set up the tent.

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:56.460
(Two Weeks Later)
Qian.

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:57.230
Qian,

00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:59.580
what about that platform
you said you'd build?

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:01.630
Maybe I'll just
go back to running the cafe.

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:03.470
Qian.

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:05.870
Mr. Pei, you...

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:09.780
This place is renovated?

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:11.670
Ma Yang,

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:13.260
I think your goal

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.710
shouldn't be
a small internet cafe branch.

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:17.950
Your goal

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:21.710
should be to help millions
realize their dreams.

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:25.020
Do you remember Tengda's philosophy?

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:26.190
"Teng" means...

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:29.150
Staying true to our original intent.

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.910
"Da" means...

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:31.780
Benefiting the world at large.

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:38.780
It's time to give back to the world.

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.670
Do you know
what an investment firm does?

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:53.870
They look for companies with potential,

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:54.950
and put money into them.

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:55.780
We take a cut

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:56.910

DreamForge Capital

00:28:59.168 --> 00:29:00.540
is about making dreams come true,

not making money.

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:04.020
But I don't have any experience.

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:04.910

Other investors only care about numbers,

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:17.470
but you

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:19.230

Here.

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:36.470
Mr. Pei,

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:38.780
you mentioned
developing a Soulslike game.

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:40.190
I've thought through a few directions.

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:41.150
Please take a look.

(Souls-style narrative)

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:45.670
These examples are excellent.

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:46.910
I now know for sure

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:47.540
that I want you

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:49.430
and Lv to be in charge of this game.

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:52.390
Deserted Island Sharpshooter made money,

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:53.100
but I've realized

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.670
that following trends is wrong.

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:56.300
I've reflected on it deeply.

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.150
This time,

00:29:57.150 --> 00:29:59.710
we must create
a truly original core gameplay.

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:03.540
Something the market
has never seen before.

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:07.910
Write this down.

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:09.020
Okay.

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:11.470
We're going
to integrate classical poetry.

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:13.260
Combat will be driven by poetry.

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:15.740
(Soulslike games are already hard.)

00:30:15.835 --> 00:30:16.990
(Add poetry on top of that,)

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:18.213
(wouldn't it be even harder?)

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:21.540
Good.

No.

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:49.780
I just wanted to ask,

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:51.020
do you usually

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:52.740
read a lot of novels?

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.470
Not during work hours, usually.

00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:56.820
That's not what I meant.

00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:58.990
You can use work hours however you like.

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:00.230
I'm just curious.

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:02.150
What kind of novels are the easiest

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:03.300
to get hooked on?

00:31:05.035 --> 00:31:07.190
There are male-focused
and female-focused novels.

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:08.857
Male-focused stories
are full of comebacks.

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.257
People love a rock-bottom rebound.

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:11.430
Confronting villains,

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:13.060
crushing bullies with status and power,

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:14.340
big plot reversals,

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:16.260
cheat powers, and main character buffs.

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:17.630
Guys love progression.

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:18.849
Which weapon is stronger,

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:20.020
and which master ranks higher.

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:21.740
If there's someone powerful,

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:23.020
another has to be stronger.

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:24.991
Female-focused stories
lean more toward romance.

00:31:24.991 --> 00:31:26.809
Sweet love and melodrama
both have audiences.

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:28.530
BE romances,
tragic endings, are popular too.

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:29.870
So many domineering CEOs get written

00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:30.870
every single year!

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:31.910
And cheat powers too.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:33.740
Everyone complains about cheat powers,

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:35.150
but they still love reading them.

00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:36.190
It's all about the rush.

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:37.990
All readers love overpowered characters

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:39.540
throwing in heroic rescues and the like.

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:41.540
So this hero-saving-the-damsel thing,

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:43.340
does it work for both audiences?

00:31:43.591 --> 00:31:45.910
Probably the difference is
how many damsels get saved.

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:50.390

Yes.

slogan is this.

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.870
No matter whether
your starting point is English, French,

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:21.140
Qian,

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:23.540
I've found a lot of people with dreams.

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:24.660
They all want funding,

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:26.020
but the budget is limited.

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:27.180
It's our first time after all.

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:27.990

Please tell us your dream.

My dream is

00:36:33.835 --> 00:36:35.740

grilled cold noodles.

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:38.020
I believe my grilled cold noodles

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:40.100
are definitely going to become viral.

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:42.310
We'll use

users and platforms.

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:48.180
We'll be heating up cold noodles,

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:49.950

You're hitting yourself.

You're clearly

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:52.390
It doesn't hurt.

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:53.350
I get it now.

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:54.580
You want me to invest in

No.

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:00.830
is me.

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:04.140
My name is Shi Huo.

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:06.270
My dream is to truly make it big.

00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:08.790
I want everyone to know

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.470
that I am an actor.

00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:13.870
Shi Huo, male, 25 years old.

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:14.950
I'm 185 cm tall.

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:16.220
I weigh 72 kg.

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:18.470
Graduated from Jinchuan
Vocational and Technical College.

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:19.540
Five years since debut.

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:20.220
I've appeared in

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:22.310
48 outstanding film and TV productions.

00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:25.020
Here's a compilation of my roles.

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:26.835
(Blazing Glory)
(The Brilliance of Acting)

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:32.060
(Shi Huo 48)

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:34.870
Which one are you?

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:35.950
Please take a look.

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:38.310
This was the biggest test

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:40.790
I've faced since my debut.

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:44.830
A stable hand
holding the lead actor's horse.

00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:47.500
A working-class role.

00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:48.990
Five years.

00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:50.270
A full five years.

00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:52.830
And all I earned

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:54.990
was a single side profile.

00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:57.100
That was a milestone victory.

00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:58.390
I believe in myself.

00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:59.870
My future is bright.

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:01.870
You scared me for a second.

00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:03.368
I hope your company will invest in me.

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:09.350
Okay.

Thank you.

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:12.060

(Post-writing evaluation metrics)

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:19.470
Everyone,

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:20.790
Zhongdian Web Fiction

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:22.620
places no limits on genres.

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:24.830
But per Mr. Pei's instructions,

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:25.910
our iron rule

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:28.470
is to break formulas
and chase originality.

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:30.540
You all have the forms, right?

00:39:30.657 --> 00:39:32.080
Everything you write has

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:33.880
(Writing evaluation criteria)
to be reviewed.

00:39:33.924 --> 00:39:36.100
You need
at least 70 points across metrics

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:38.790
Excuse me.

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:40.060
What does

00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:42.470
the "junk cheat-power" score even mean?

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:44.060
Exactly what it sounds like.

00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:47.750
From now on, no cheat powers.

00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:49.660
Villains can bully the protagonist,

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:51.660
but the protagonist can't fight back.

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:53.060
We encourage

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:55.180
stories about ordinary people.

Isn't that just a daily log?

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:02.990
- Yeah.
- Yes.

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:03.910
What's there to write?

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:04.660
Can I ask,

00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:07.870
what does the
"no hero points" score mean?

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.660
It means

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:11.140
we ban the hero-saves-the-damsel trope.

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:12.180
The male lead

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:13.060
can no longer be

00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:15.500
the hero in multiple women's eyes.

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:16.620
Ideally,

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:17.270
the girls

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:19.540
don't like him at all.

00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:22.830
Then what about

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:24.700
the "break the plot armor" score?

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:25.950
What does that mean?

00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:27.910
It means

00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:30.910
the protagonist can't be a genius,

00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:31.791
or a hidden prodigy.

00:40:31.857 --> 00:40:33.220
They have to be painfully average.

00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:35.270
Bad at pretty much everything.

00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:36.620
Let me give an example.

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:38.580
For female-focused fiction,

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:39.870
no more domineering CEOs.

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:40.500
Remember this.

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:42.013
Once you join Zhongdian Web Fiction,

00:40:42.013 --> 00:40:43.020
no more domineering CEOs.

00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:44.270
(Zhongdian Web Fiction)
Never again.

00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:46.220
The male lead should be
as pathetic as possible.

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:47.280
In male-focused fiction,

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.390
the male lead must
stay miserable from start to finish.

00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:50.580
No comebacks, ever.

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:53.470
He has to be
mercilessly crushed by fate,

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:55.350
ground into dust.

00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:58.950
Ground into dust?

00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:05.220
I know this is hard to accept,

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:06.270
but Mr. Pei made it clear.

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:07.620
Creation must be innovative.

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:11.790
Everyone understands, right?

00:41:13.702 --> 00:41:14.870
That part isn't important.

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:16.470
Trust me.

Zhongdian Web Fiction's core belief

00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:18.660
is to

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:21.340
let great books end their journey here.
