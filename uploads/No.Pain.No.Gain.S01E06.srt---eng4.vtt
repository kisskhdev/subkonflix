(Adapted from the Qidian novel)

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.960
=Episode 6=
(This story is purely fictional.)

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.080
Have a pack.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.080
Thank you.

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:15.239
Everyone, please pause your work
for a moment.

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:16.600
There's good news.

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:19.679
As thanks for your contributions
to The Lonely Road,

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:22.280
Divine General Pact

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.160
and Deserted Island Sharpshooter,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.000
Mr. Pei has decided

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.919
to allocate 50 percent
of the games' net profits

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:29.280
as bonuses

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.840
to all Tengda employees.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.040
That much?

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.560
I haven't worked long.
I have no frame of reference.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.720
Is that a high percentage?

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.880
I've worked for years
and I still don't know.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.160
I've never even seen a bonus.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.880
Oh, right.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.679
So it feels real to everyone,

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:48.880
Mr. Pei has decided

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.600
the bonuses will be paid out
on the spot.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.919
Come to my office to collect them.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.280
(Disappointed. Culprit.)
Huang Sibo is completely out of control.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.057
First, he secretly worked overtime
to finish Divine General Pact.

00:03:16.057 --> 00:03:17.480
Then, he added a PvP mini-game

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.910
in the perfectly laggy
Deserted Island Sharpshooter.

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:20.840
He

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.160
is the main reason Tengda
made a killing.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.720
This is deeply disappointing.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.720
Exactly.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.679
He's the most active one.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.480
(Bonus: 88,888
Total salary: 128,888)

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:33.919
I only did the most basic things.

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:35.679
It was all part of my regular duties.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.600
Why did Mr. Pei give me so much?

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.600
(Toxic)
And this guy.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.560
Zone B, 517.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.440
I didn't expect him
to be a dark horse as well.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.000
Huang Sibo thought of adding mini-games

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.013
entirely because of him.

00:03:47.035 --> 00:03:48.320
He's basically a toxic presence

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.479
and a bad apple in the team.

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:53.440
Keeping him around will definitely
cause trouble later.

00:03:53.502 --> 00:03:54.835
(Bonus: 88,888
Total salary: 121,388)

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.720
Is my work really worth that much?

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.560
Deserted Island Sharpshooter's success

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.880
can also be attributed to Lin Wan.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.160
(Accomplice)
She brought in her own connections

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.600
and let them play for free.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.720
It had a devastating promotional effect.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.720
(Bonus: 88,888
Total salary: 121,388)

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:16.879
Ms. Xin.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.319
I haven't worked many jobs.

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:21.439
Are bonuses normally this high?

00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:22.999
This was Mr. Pei's decision.

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:25.040
After all, you've all
worked hard recently.

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:27.600
By the way, help me call
the janitor.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.191
Have her come collect her bonus as well.

00:04:29.191 --> 00:04:30.670
The janitor gets one too?

00:04:32.799 --> 00:04:34.919
Mr. Pei really takes care of everyone.

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:38.600
He's okay.

00:04:39.346 --> 00:04:40.702
This Lin Wan

00:04:40.768 --> 00:04:42.790
(Accomplice)
might be worth observing a bit longer.

00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:44.160
As long as it's explicitly forbidden

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.799
for her to use her personal connections,

00:04:45.799 --> 00:04:47.600
she won't be able to do much.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.600
But Huang Sibo and Bao Xu...

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:53.600
Those two must be dealt with.

00:04:53.613 --> 00:04:54.790
How should we deal with them?

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.040
Fire them or demote them?

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.880
Without evidence,
it would violate regulations.

00:05:00.359 --> 00:05:04.359
It's finally time to unleash my

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.119
ultimate move.

00:05:07.239 --> 00:05:08.160
Everyone,

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.239
Tengda's first

00:05:09.239 --> 00:05:11.879
Best Employee Award,
organized by Mr. Pei,

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:13.119
has concluded

00:05:13.119 --> 00:05:14.479
after anonymous voting.

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:16.160
The Best Employee

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.280
will receive

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.040
a one-million-yuan Dream Fund.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.160
Anything you wish,

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.119
any field, any industry,

00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:25.359
the company will pay for your dream.

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:27.160
We hereby announce

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.559
the first

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:30.999
(First Best Employee Award)
Best Employee...

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:33.070
(Candidates: Huang Sibo, Bao Xu,
Lin Wan, Hao Qiong, Li Yada)

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:34.799
Huang Sibo.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.000
(Best Employee: Huang Sibo)

00:05:39.239 --> 00:05:39.919
Everyone.

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:41.600
This is such a surprise.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.799
Let me say a few words.

00:05:42.799 --> 00:05:43.600
I...

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.790
(Acceptance Speech)
Deserted Island Sharpshooter's success

00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:46.739
is thanks to Mr. Pei.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:47.790
It was Mr. Pei who gave us

00:05:49.799 --> 00:05:50.799
this project

00:05:50.799 --> 00:05:51.999
- its moment to shine.
- Alright.

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:54.160
Let's give it up for Sibo.

00:05:55.239 --> 00:05:56.239
Next,

00:05:56.239 --> 00:05:59.160
is the second-place winner
of the Best Employee Award.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.502
(Candidates: Bao Xu, Lin Wan)
And that person is...

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.160
Bao Xu.

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:05.559
(Second Place: Bao Xu)
Even though you're second,

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:06.919
the company hasn't forgotten

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:07.879
your hard work.

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:09.720
The company has prepared for you

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.479
one month of paid leave.

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:12.479
Yes!

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.319
And a VIP tour package.

00:06:17.239 --> 00:06:18.119
Wait, Mr. Pei,

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:19.469
you know I don't go out.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:20.702
(Annual Best Employee Top 2)
I don't want time off.

00:06:20.702 --> 00:06:21.670
Don't make me travel, okay?

00:06:21.679 --> 00:06:22.600
No.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.999
Even though you're

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:25.919
Tengda's Chief Game Playtester,

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:27.789
you can't just shut yourself away.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:28.389
Right?

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.799
Traveling ten thousand miles
beats reading ten thousand books.

00:06:30.799 --> 00:06:32.400
Go see the beautiful mountains
and rivers

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.239
of our great country.

00:06:33.239 --> 00:06:34.559
No, my knees are bad.

00:06:38.119 --> 00:06:39.799
Congratulations, Bao Xu.

00:06:40.239 --> 00:06:41.600
I don't want to travel.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.040
Let's send Huang Sibo off
to start a business,

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.600
and Bao Xu off on his trip.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.600
But Tengda's gaming division

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.239
still needs a new project manager.

00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:53.119
And that person is...

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:55.559
It has to be Lin Wan.

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:03.080
Lin Wan! Lin Wan!

00:07:03.359 --> 00:07:04.520
Lin Wan! Lin Wan!

00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:07.600
Lv Mingliang!

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:08.879
Lv Mingliang?

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:09.640
What?

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.879
Congrats, Lv!

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.160
Congrats to Lv on the promotion
and raise!

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.559
And when you two leave,

00:07:15.559 --> 00:07:18.239
make sure you hand everything over
to Lv Mingliang properly.

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:19.160
Yes, Mr. Pei.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.999
Mr. Pei, I don't want to travel!

00:07:22.119 --> 00:07:23.040
Congratulations.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:23.919
Thanks, everyone.

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:27.919
Wait, I'm not done speaking.

00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:29.359
Besides Mr. Pei,

00:07:29.359 --> 00:07:32.799
I also want to thank Lin Wan,
Bao, and Lv.

00:07:32.799 --> 00:07:34.799
My success today

00:07:34.799 --> 00:07:38.239
is thanks to every single one of you.

00:07:38.239 --> 00:07:39.239
Thank you, everyone!

00:07:39.679 --> 00:07:40.479
Mr. Pei,

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:42.919
I will never let you down.

00:07:53.479 --> 00:07:55.879
The first elimination

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.559
was a complete success.

00:07:59.191 --> 00:07:59.809
(Tengda)

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:01.340
- Mr. Ma, welcome back.
- Mr. Ma, welcome back.

00:08:01.346 --> 00:08:03.110
Yes, I'm back. Perfect sync.

00:08:05.791 --> 00:08:06.550
Welcome back, Mr. Ma.

00:08:06.559 --> 00:08:06.919
Mr. Ma.

00:08:06.919 --> 00:08:07.879
I'm back.

00:08:13.879 --> 00:08:16.679
Annual Best Employee Top One?

00:08:17.479 --> 00:08:18.879
And Top Two?

00:08:19.013 --> 00:08:20.160
I'm only gone for two days,

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.835
and you've already put up
a hall of fame?

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:26.919
They're not even here,

00:08:26.919 --> 00:08:28.999
so why stick their photos up?

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.670
Next time, I'm winning that award.

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:33.599
Just watch.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:39.880
Let's go eat.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.120
Yun, lunch time.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.679
Lv, lunch time.

00:08:55.319 --> 00:08:56.559
What's wrong, Lv?

00:08:57.919 --> 00:08:59.480
I'm just an R&D programmer.

00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:00.919
Why did Mr. Pei make me

00:09:00.919 --> 00:09:02.679
a project manager?

00:09:03.324 --> 00:09:05.190
Do you think Mr. Pei
found out I secretly

00:09:05.199 --> 00:09:06.559
helped you guys fix bugs?

00:09:07.919 --> 00:09:09.520
No way. We never said anything.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.079
How would he even know?

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.324
The first time I agreed
to help Huang Sibo

00:09:16.324 --> 00:09:17.813
was because he was way too intense.

00:09:17.813 --> 00:09:19.830
I didn't want to deal with
that kind of project manager,

00:09:19.835 --> 00:09:20.550
so I helped him.

00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:22.559
Just to make him stop bugging me.

00:09:22.919 --> 00:09:23.919
And now look.

00:09:24.679 --> 00:09:27.439
I helped and helped
until I got myself dragged in.

00:09:27.559 --> 00:09:29.439
Now I'm the one in charge.

00:09:29.559 --> 00:09:31.559
Stop thinking about it. Let's go to eat.

00:09:31.559 --> 00:09:32.400
I'm starving.

00:09:32.799 --> 00:09:33.679
Let's go.

00:09:33.679 --> 00:09:34.439
Here it is.

00:09:34.439 --> 00:09:35.799
I'm not eating.

00:09:35.799 --> 00:09:37.040
What are you guys doing?

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.480
It's lunch break.

00:09:38.524 --> 00:09:40.040
Absolutely no overtime is allowed.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:40.919
Overtime?

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.439
No.

00:09:42.839 --> 00:09:44.799
Mr. Pei...

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:46.319
I swear I did not work overtime.

00:09:46.319 --> 00:09:47.919
I hate working overtime.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.919
How about you assign someone else
to lead the project?

00:09:50.919 --> 00:09:52.319
I'm just a code monkey.

00:09:52.319 --> 00:09:54.439
There's still so much I need to learn.

00:09:54.559 --> 00:09:56.160
Or maybe I could study

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.679
different game update strategies.

00:09:57.679 --> 00:09:59.439
We need to prepare for the future.

00:09:59.439 --> 00:10:00.799
Updates?

00:10:00.799 --> 00:10:02.679
Who said anything about updates?

00:10:02.959 --> 00:10:04.839
Let me tell you something. From now on,

00:10:04.839 --> 00:10:06.240
we will not update any of our games.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.439
- No updates at all?
- What?

00:10:07.439 --> 00:10:08.679
That's right.

00:10:10.799 --> 00:10:12.040
We can't just

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.040
rest on past achievements.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.799
We need to let go of the old games.

00:10:15.799 --> 00:10:16.919
Remember what I said.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.679
From now on, no game

00:10:18.679 --> 00:10:20.799
is allowed to receive any updates.

00:10:20.902 --> 00:10:22.790
But games stagnate if they don't evolve.

00:10:22.799 --> 00:10:24.319
If we don't release new games,

00:10:24.319 --> 00:10:25.919
we'll be eliminated very quickly.

00:10:25.919 --> 00:10:26.679
Exactly.

00:10:27.799 --> 00:10:30.160
That's why we need to make new games.

00:10:31.919 --> 00:10:33.160
Do you already have

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.439
new plans for the next game?

00:10:34.439 --> 00:10:35.679
What do we need to do?

00:10:38.679 --> 00:10:40.439
Let's not rush that for now.

00:10:40.799 --> 00:10:43.799
Let Lv get used to his new role first.

00:10:43.919 --> 00:10:45.559
Wait, Mr. Pei...

00:10:45.559 --> 00:10:47.040
Do I really have to get used to it?

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.040
Can we promote someone else instead?

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.439
I get it.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.319
Young people

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:55.799
are meant to grow.

00:10:55.799 --> 00:10:58.040
You can't let a promotion

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.919
put too much pressure on you.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.799
Physical and mental health come first.

00:11:01.919 --> 00:11:02.919
Look at you,

00:11:02.919 --> 00:11:03.439
you've...

00:11:07.439 --> 00:11:08.799
stopped growing taller.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.319
Eat properly.

00:11:11.319 --> 00:11:12.160
Mr. Pei...

00:11:12.919 --> 00:11:14.799
I don't want to grow.

00:11:21.799 --> 00:11:24.160
It's fine. Come on, let's eat.

00:11:26.799 --> 00:11:28.160
Let's go.

00:11:31.559 --> 00:11:38.280

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.319
Stop singing.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.319
Stop singing.

00:11:55.319 --> 00:11:57.400
You're going to make me leave.

00:11:57.799 --> 00:12:00.040
Mr. Ma, what's wrong?

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.559
There's no one here anyway.

00:12:01.559 --> 00:12:03.679
I figured I'd sing a bit,
and blow off some steam.

00:12:05.439 --> 00:12:07.799
I'll sing more quietly, then.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.040
♪Beyond the pavilion♪

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.040

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.613
We've got food, drinks,
and internet here.

00:12:15.613 --> 00:12:16.550

Yeah, that was me.

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.324
Do you realize you're disturbing
the neighbors?

00:12:26.324 --> 00:12:27.430
You sound like a dying cat.

00:12:27.439 --> 00:12:28.919
I've been circling outside for ages.

00:12:28.919 --> 00:12:31.799
I seriously can't take it anymore.

00:12:32.439 --> 00:12:33.679
Sorry about that.

00:12:33.679 --> 00:12:34.640
Sorry...

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.319
Are you the owner?

00:12:36.319 --> 00:12:37.799
Are you hiring singers here?

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:38.799
Let me sing instead.

00:12:38.799 --> 00:12:41.160
This is unbearable.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.679
This place was just rented out.

00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:45.160
So you'll need to move along.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.839
You won't be able to stay here anymore.

00:12:49.319 --> 00:12:51.559
Weren't you the guy earlier
burning incense outside?

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.599
I'm just a programmer.

00:13:00.599 --> 00:13:02.719
Why would Mr. Pei make me
project manager?

00:13:02.719 --> 00:13:03.959
I'm in charge of the project,

00:13:03.959 --> 00:13:05.599
but who's in charge of my life?

00:13:05.839 --> 00:13:08.319
All I wanted was a job where I
could slack off on the clock.

00:13:08.319 --> 00:13:10.360
Clock out on time and go have fun.

00:13:10.839 --> 00:13:12.360
But I never expected this.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.199
Why did it turn out like this?

00:13:14.959 --> 00:13:16.480
Don't put so much pressure on yourself.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.360
If anything comes up,

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.959
just come to me for help.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.439
You've already had
five glasses of juice.

00:13:22.439 --> 00:13:23.599
Why not have some alcohol?

00:13:23.599 --> 00:13:24.880
We don't work tomorrow.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.959
No way. I'm hiking
with someone tomorrow.

00:13:26.959 --> 00:13:28.199
I need to get up early.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:31.839
Here.

00:13:39.102 --> 00:13:40.670
Luckily, Mr. Pei hasn't assigned me

00:13:40.679 --> 00:13:42.480
any specific tasks yet.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:43.590
I can still catch my breath.

00:13:43.591 --> 00:13:45.168
Or if the intensity ramps up
all at once,

00:13:45.168 --> 00:13:46.480
I wouldn't be able to handle it.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.199
I think he just wants us

00:13:49.199 --> 00:13:50.959
to calm down and think about the future.

00:13:50.959 --> 00:13:53.719
The old games were
making money effortlessly,

00:13:53.719 --> 00:13:55.360
yet he banned updates.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:58.079
Instead, he's putting effort
into developing new projects.

00:13:58.319 --> 00:14:00.599
He's not the kind of mediocre boss

00:14:00.599 --> 00:14:02.199
who just sits on past achievements.

00:14:02.199 --> 00:14:04.360
That's why Tengda can become

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.839
truly unmatched in the industry.

00:14:07.679 --> 00:14:08.120
I think

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.480
you're actually more suited to be
the project manager.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.959
You're basically built for it.

00:14:11.959 --> 00:14:13.719
I originally thought the job
would go to you.

00:14:13.719 --> 00:14:14.839
I didn't expect it to go to me.

00:14:14.839 --> 00:14:17.360
I'll go talk to Mr. Pei.
You'd definitely do this job

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.599
better than I.

00:14:18.599 --> 00:14:20.079
Don't say that, Lv.

00:14:20.079 --> 00:14:21.480
Don't sell yourself short.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.599
Mr. Pei chose you,

00:14:22.599 --> 00:14:24.199
so he must have his reasons.

00:14:24.199 --> 00:14:25.959
I just need to get more involved
in the work

00:14:25.959 --> 00:14:27.480
and gain more experience.

00:14:35.799 --> 00:14:36.959
Hello, everyone.

00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:38.319
My name is Chen Lei.

00:14:38.559 --> 00:14:40.240
I'll be performing

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.319
an original song of my own.

This kid actually has some real talent.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.599
The song he wrote isn't bad at all.

00:14:56.319 --> 00:14:57.079
Just like me,

00:14:57.079 --> 00:14:58.439
we're both the creative type.

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.199
Guess people really do need to dress up.

00:15:03.199 --> 00:15:05.599
Who would've thought Chen Lei
used to be like that?

00:15:06.199 --> 00:15:08.360
If he's just singing on stage,

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.189
isn't giving him a 30 percent cut

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:11.510
of the drink sales a bit too much?

00:15:11.524 --> 00:15:12.710
Maybe make it ten percent?

00:15:12.719 --> 00:15:13.719
I'm kind of regretting it.

00:15:13.719 --> 00:15:15.599
It's not too much.
Thirty percent isn't too much.

00:15:15.599 --> 00:15:16.360
Isn't it?

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.839
Aren't we still losing money anyway?

00:15:17.839 --> 00:15:18.839
We're not even profitable.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.830
Where are you getting the commission
to give him?

00:15:21.079 --> 00:15:21.839
True.

00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:24.079
Compared to me,

00:15:24.199 --> 00:15:26.000
he's still lacking a bit
in explosive power.

00:15:37.559 --> 00:15:39.120

Thanks, Mr. Ma.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.559
Mr. Ma, why did you suddenly
change singers today?

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.240
The previous singer

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.480
was honestly a bit of a challenge
for customers.

00:15:52.799 --> 00:15:54.000
But this one today

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.959
might just turn things around.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.679
Turn things around?

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
We're still losing money,
barely scraping by.

00:16:00.559 --> 00:16:01.880
Come, let's have a toast.

before 3:42 PM,

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.159
we'll officially turn profitable.

00:19:15.159 --> 00:19:15.920

I got here in time?

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.280
Do you know how big a mess
you've made for me?

00:19:25.302 --> 00:19:26.870
You've thrown my entire plan off.

00:19:26.879 --> 00:19:29.319
You've done massive damage
to Tengda's image.

00:19:29.319 --> 00:19:30.359
Do you understand?

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.839
What's wrong with turning a profit?

00:19:37.319 --> 00:19:38.359
Ma Yang.

00:19:39.119 --> 00:19:41.319
Did I put you in charge
of M&Y Internet Cafe

00:19:41.319 --> 00:19:42.760
just to make a profit?

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:44.159
My goal was...

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.319
Right. Exactly.

00:19:46.319 --> 00:19:48.879
To serve as a window
for our corporate image,

00:19:48.879 --> 00:19:50.359
something to showcase to the public.

00:19:50.359 --> 00:19:51.839
But look at what it is now.

00:19:53.359 --> 00:19:54.040
Now it's...

00:19:54.359 --> 00:19:55.000
Inside it's a

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.079
live house.

00:19:56.359 --> 00:19:58.879
Outside is a seaside-style town.

00:20:01.319 --> 00:20:02.159
Ma Yang.

00:20:02.599 --> 00:20:04.589
Now you've even learned to talk back.

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:05.991
If you're going to be like this,

00:20:05.991 --> 00:20:07.920
then I can't have
a business conversation with you.

00:20:10.079 --> 00:20:12.520
It's a seaside-style food stall, okay?

00:20:15.839 --> 00:20:16.760
Ma Yang.

00:20:17.413 --> 00:20:19.746
I'm not saying
being down-to-earth is bad,

00:20:19.768 --> 00:20:20.630
but the problem is

00:20:20.639 --> 00:20:22.440
what company would turn
its flagship store

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.000
into a nightclub on one side,

00:20:24.119 --> 00:20:26.000
and food stalls outside?

00:20:26.119 --> 00:20:27.639
Do you know what this is called?

00:20:27.639 --> 00:20:30.520
This is penny-wise and pound-foolish.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.319
Then what do we do, Mr. Pei?

00:20:36.319 --> 00:20:38.079
Mr. Pei, just give the order.

00:20:38.079 --> 00:20:39.520
Whatever you say, we'll do.

00:20:42.079 --> 00:20:43.079
It's actually simple.

00:20:43.079 --> 00:20:44.599
Remove all this flashy,

00:20:44.599 --> 00:20:45.559
neon nonsense.

00:20:45.559 --> 00:20:46.309
And that

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:47.902
"dying-by-the-sea" style food stall?

00:20:47.902 --> 00:20:49.490
Restore everything
back to the way it was.

00:20:50.399 --> 00:20:51.319
Huh? What?

00:20:51.319 --> 00:20:52.879
Not "dying" style.

00:20:52.879 --> 00:20:54.839
It's "seaside" style.

00:20:56.599 --> 00:20:59.079
Then what about Chen Lei?

I heard you've never left Jinchuan

Do you want to go see the outside world?

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:53.440

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.839
you're so good-looking.

Don't you want to be an idol?

Your voice is heavenly.

00:22:01.599 --> 00:22:03.760
Don't you want more people to hear it?

Chen Lei,

00:22:07.839 --> 00:22:10.319
life is long, very long.

00:22:10.319 --> 00:22:12.159
It's about time you started thinking

00:22:12.159 --> 00:22:13.639
about your own dream.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:17.760
Mr. Pei, I've never really had
any dreams since I was little.

00:22:18.359 --> 00:22:20.000
I don't know what I should do,

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.520
and I don't know where I should go.

00:22:22.635 --> 00:22:23.390
Let me tell you

00:22:23.399 --> 00:22:24.639
where you should go.

00:22:27.079 --> 00:22:28.359
With your talent,

00:22:28.359 --> 00:22:29.839
you should leave Jinchuan,

00:22:29.839 --> 00:22:31.280
go nationwide and compete.

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.440
Let the whole country know you.

00:22:34.639 --> 00:22:36.599
But I'm just an ordinary person.

00:22:37.079 --> 00:22:38.680
M&Y Internet Cafe is pretty great.

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.520
I feel comfortable staying here.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.839
It's actually quite nice
to live in the moment.

00:22:43.839 --> 00:22:45.520
If I go chasing a dream
just to have one,

00:22:46.079 --> 00:22:47.599
won't I get even more lost?

00:22:48.359 --> 00:22:50.000
Being lost is the point.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:51.760
If you

00:22:52.079 --> 00:22:53.359
have no experience,

00:22:53.359 --> 00:22:55.399
how can you ever find yourself?

00:22:56.079 --> 00:22:58.119
A guy once told me,

00:22:58.319 --> 00:23:00.149
you can't see what "you" are.

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:01.924
Only when you go out
and experience things,

00:23:01.946 --> 00:23:03.590
hit something and bounce back,

00:23:03.599 --> 00:23:05.520
will you discover what you are.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:08.319
So,

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.359
I'm willing to sponsor you

00:23:10.839 --> 00:23:12.599
to go see the outside world,

00:23:12.879 --> 00:23:14.119
to go find yourself.

00:23:14.168 --> 00:23:15.568
And with Tengda backing you up,

00:23:15.591 --> 00:23:16.413
even if you fail,

00:23:16.413 --> 00:23:18.350
you can come back
to M&Y Internet Cafe anytime.

00:23:18.359 --> 00:23:19.079
What do you say?

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:23.680
Really?

Starting tomorrow,

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.839
I won't be singing here anymore.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.119
Why?

00:23:55.359 --> 00:23:56.680
What happened?

00:24:10.399 --> 00:24:12.040
No need to overthink it.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.599
I've never really found
a purpose in life,

00:24:18.359 --> 00:24:20.119
and I don't see much of a future

00:24:20.879 --> 00:24:23.879
until I met someone.

00:24:24.359 --> 00:24:25.879
He woke me up.

00:24:26.359 --> 00:24:27.720
He's willing to sponsor me

00:24:27.924 --> 00:24:29.630
to look for stronger possibilities.

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.119
I love you all.

00:24:32.359 --> 00:24:33.639
I love this place.

00:24:34.079 --> 00:24:35.639
And I'm grateful to everyone.

00:24:36.599 --> 00:24:37.399
But

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.920
this is a precious opportunity.

00:24:42.079 --> 00:24:43.359
I want to go out and take a shot.

00:24:43.724 --> 00:24:45.080
I want to try...

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:47.879
To see how far I can go,

00:24:49.079 --> 00:24:50.399
and to see if I can find

00:24:52.079 --> 00:24:53.359
my life's purpose.

00:24:58.639 --> 00:24:59.879
That's a good thing.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.240
We support you!

00:25:01.359 --> 00:25:03.040
If you get rich, don't forget us!

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.920
Ten glasses of White Moon on me.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.399
Wishing you a smooth journey!

00:25:06.399 --> 00:25:09.639

00:25:09.639 --> 00:25:11.399
- Me too! Me too!
- And me!

00:25:11.399 --> 00:25:13.879
Thank you, everyone.

00:25:17.599 --> 00:25:19.079
I'd like to dedicate

00:25:19.079 --> 00:25:20.879
this last song to all of you.

00:25:21.346 --> 00:25:23.000
It's almost the Chinese New Year.

00:25:23.599 --> 00:25:25.079
I hope everyone

00:25:25.599 --> 00:25:27.359
can reunite with your families

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.680
and have a warm, wonderful
Chinese New Year.

00:25:35.319 --> 00:25:38.520
Mr. Ma, don't be sad.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.079
Chen Lei is sentimental.

00:25:41.639 --> 00:25:42.879
You've been so good to him.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.119
He'll definitely come back to see you.

00:25:45.813 --> 00:25:47.920
Just when we were about to start
making money,

00:25:48.879 --> 00:25:50.440
the kid's making his debut.

00:25:51.399 --> 00:25:52.760
And we still have to sponsor him.

00:25:56.359 --> 00:25:57.599
So what do we do?

00:25:58.119 --> 00:25:59.639
Don't overthink it.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.839
We have to listen to Mr. Pei.

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.520
It's fine.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.480
If Chen Lei leaves,

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.359
we'll just hire a new resident singer.

00:26:09.839 --> 00:26:10.879
Besides,

00:26:11.079 --> 00:26:12.520
you've still got me.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:13.879
Worst case,

00:26:14.591 --> 00:26:16.310
I'll go up there and keep singing.

00:26:16.319 --> 00:26:18.200
This is my signature song.

00:26:29.879 --> 00:26:34.879
♪Green grass stretches to the sky♪

00:26:36.079 --> 00:26:42.520
♪A gentle breeze stirs the willows,

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:49.119
♪The sun sets beyond the distant hills♪

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.760
(One Month Later)

00:27:36.599 --> 00:27:38.280
So this is what you're all
talking about?

00:27:38.399 --> 00:27:40.040
No way. Absolutely not.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:40.680
Exactly.

00:27:41.079 --> 00:27:41.839
Mr. Ge,

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.639
the elevator installation

00:27:43.639 --> 00:27:45.440
was initiated
by the neighborhood committee.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.589
You agreed too,

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:48.480
and the neighbors all agreed
to compensate you.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.791
So why did you change your mind

00:27:49.791 --> 00:27:51.499
the moment
the construction team arrived?

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:52.070
- Yeah.
- Yes.

00:27:52.079 --> 00:27:53.399
Yeah. Mr. Ge.

00:27:53.399 --> 00:27:54.599
When we negotiated

00:27:54.599 --> 00:27:55.799
the elevator installation,

00:27:55.799 --> 00:27:57.440
didn't your whole family sign?

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:57.760
Yeah.

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.079
So why are you refusing now?

00:27:59.079 --> 00:28:00.639
Last year was last year.

00:28:00.639 --> 00:28:02.680
This year's a different situation.

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.159
Sure, the people who live upstairs

00:28:04.159 --> 00:28:05.720
don't have to climb stairs anymore.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.191
But what about us on the first floor?

00:28:07.213 --> 00:28:08.280
This is just unreasonable.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:09.839
There's barely any space,

00:28:09.839 --> 00:28:11.599
and your elevator takes it all up.

00:28:11.599 --> 00:28:12.799
That space out front

00:28:12.799 --> 00:28:14.440
is public space.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:15.559
Exactly.

00:28:15.559 --> 00:28:16.280
When your family

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:19.349
piled junk there,
and grew vegetables and flowers,

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:20.502
didn't we all let it slide?

00:28:20.546 --> 00:28:21.590
You piled junk there too.

00:28:21.599 --> 00:28:22.280
Yeah.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.839
Installing an elevator

00:28:23.839 --> 00:28:25.639
is for everyone's convenience.

00:28:25.639 --> 00:28:27.799
You agreed back then.

00:28:27.799 --> 00:28:29.599
If you didn't want it
in the first place,

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.040
why did you agree at all?

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:31.835
Yeah.

00:28:31.835 --> 00:28:33.280
If you didn't agree, just don't sign it.

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:34.830
Are you trying to jack up the price now?

00:28:35.102 --> 00:28:37.591
Hey! What's with you people?

00:28:37.613 --> 00:28:41.013
You think you're right just because
there are more of you and you're louder?

00:28:41.124 --> 00:28:44.350
Let me tell you, we are dead set against
installing an elevator.

00:28:44.391 --> 00:28:45.590
How can you be so unreasonable?

00:28:45.599 --> 00:28:47.309
It's just climbing stairs.

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:48.835
You've climbed them your whole lives.

00:28:48.902 --> 00:28:49.590
Keep climbing.

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:51.413
You won't be climbing them
much longer anyway.

00:28:54.359 --> 00:28:55.839
How can you talk like that?

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.920
Who says something that nasty?

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.920
That's too much.

00:29:04.359 --> 00:29:06.359
That was really cruel of you to say.

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.879
Mr. Pei.

00:29:08.639 --> 00:29:11.040
We're discussing an issue here.

00:29:11.319 --> 00:29:12.440
Why are you yelling?

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:13.319
Who's yelling?

00:29:13.319 --> 00:29:13.869
You are.

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:15.249
You're being unreasonable.

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:16.359
There you go yelling again.

00:29:16.359 --> 00:29:17.920
You agreed, so let them install it.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:18.839
Dad...

00:29:18.839 --> 00:29:19.834
Dad! Mom!

00:29:19.835 --> 00:29:20.702
Madam Zhang, Mr. Ge.

00:29:20.746 --> 00:29:22.630
Why are you arguing
during the Chinese New Year?

00:29:22.639 --> 00:29:24.680
If there's an issue, talk it out.

00:29:24.702 --> 00:29:25.768
Stay out of it.

00:29:25.768 --> 00:29:26.680
He's got a clear head.

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:27.599
You're no match for him.

00:29:27.599 --> 00:29:29.599
If you're willing to negotiate,

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.079
surely, we can work something out.

00:29:31.079 --> 00:29:32.839
Do you mean that?

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.319
Then name your terms.

00:29:35.879 --> 00:29:36.960
- Yeah.
- Go on.

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:37.599
How about this?

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.440
Compensate me for this amount.

00:29:39.639 --> 00:29:40.359
That much?

00:29:40.359 --> 00:29:41.440
No way.

00:29:43.119 --> 00:29:44.000
Mr. Ge...

00:29:44.057 --> 00:29:46.429
Mr. Ge, we've been neighbors
for so many years.

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:47.440
Just do everyone a favor.

00:29:47.457 --> 00:29:49.320
Look, there are lots of elderly people

00:29:49.324 --> 00:29:50.968
with bad knees and heart problems.

00:29:51.319 --> 00:29:52.399
Just help us out.

00:29:52.399 --> 00:29:54.319
Can you name a more realistic number?

00:29:54.319 --> 00:29:55.280
Realistic?

00:29:55.359 --> 00:29:57.559
I am being realistic.
Who's covering my losses?

00:29:57.559 --> 00:29:59.040
Exactly.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.079
Let's not guilt-trip people.

00:30:01.359 --> 00:30:03.079
This is bullying.

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.399
I heard you've been

00:30:04.399 --> 00:30:06.680
doing pretty well in Jinchuan, huh?

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.568
You even bought your parents
a big house.

00:30:08.635 --> 00:30:09.920
You can afford a big house now?

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:10.880
You bought a big house?

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.000
Is that true?

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.319
You're bragging, aren't you?

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.280
You don't even have to wait
until retirement.

00:30:17.302 --> 00:30:19.590
Just move over there right now.

00:30:20.119 --> 00:30:21.079
Who's bragging?

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.440
Who's bragging?

00:30:22.591 --> 00:30:24.070
My son bought a place in Jinchuan.

00:30:24.079 --> 00:30:25.149
We all went to see it.

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:27.302
Mingri Apartments, one of those
huge flat units.

00:30:30.079 --> 00:30:31.920
If your son is that successful

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:34.000
and can buy a huge flat in Jinchuan,

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.591
why are you stirring up trouble
in our run-down old building?

00:30:36.613 --> 00:30:38.280
Let me make this clear today.

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:39.520
I don't agree.

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:41.399
No one's installing an elevator here.

00:30:42.399 --> 00:30:43.839
You're being unreasonable!

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.079
Forget it.

00:30:46.159 --> 00:30:47.079
Forget it.

00:30:53.839 --> 00:30:54.839
Forget it.

00:30:55.079 --> 00:30:55.799
Forget it.

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.079
Pei Youjun.

00:31:10.399 --> 00:31:11.839
Have a drink.

00:31:16.319 --> 00:31:17.440
Pei Youjun.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:18.839
Have a drink?

00:31:18.839 --> 00:31:19.839
I'm not drinking.

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.319
I'm in a bad mood.

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:24.680
Son, come eat.

00:31:24.839 --> 00:31:26.599
It's all your dad's signature dishes.

00:31:26.599 --> 00:31:27.760
Your favorites.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:38.839
Son,

00:31:39.079 --> 00:31:41.079
why did you come back
so early this year?

00:31:41.191 --> 00:31:44.280
Dad, Mom, I forgot to tell you,
I switched to a new job.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:46.490
The boss was worried tickets home
would be hard to get

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:48.830
during the Chinese New Year,
so he gave us our leave early.

00:31:48.839 --> 00:31:49.599
Thanks.

00:31:50.079 --> 00:31:51.440
What job did you switch to?

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.359
Is it stable?

00:31:52.599 --> 00:31:54.399
Since you're back early,

00:31:54.399 --> 00:31:55.839
will you be leaving early too?

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:57.359
Dad, Mom,

00:31:57.359 --> 00:31:59.079
my new company is called Tengda.

00:31:59.079 --> 00:32:00.319
Even though it's a startup,

00:32:00.319 --> 00:32:01.349
it's very stable.

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:03.168
And the company policies
are really relaxed.

00:32:03.191 --> 00:32:05.790
This time, I'm not going back
until after the Lantern Festival.

00:32:06.399 --> 00:32:09.079
What kind of boss is that, so generous

00:32:09.079 --> 00:32:10.559
to give such a long holiday?

00:32:10.839 --> 00:32:11.589
Yeah.

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:14.480
You used to only come back
on Chinese New Year's Eve.

00:32:14.502 --> 00:32:17.029
Last year, your mom and I waited for you
for the reunion dinner,

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:19.150
but you came back on
the first day of the Chinese New Year.

00:32:19.159 --> 00:32:20.000
Exactly.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.040
Back at Fuhui,

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.079
holidays were basically just for show.

00:32:23.079 --> 00:32:26.079
My new boss is nice,
and we get plenty of leave.

00:32:26.079 --> 00:32:27.799
The company policies are relaxed too.

00:32:27.799 --> 00:32:29.680
This time, I'll leave
after the Lantern Festival,

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.080
so I can spend more time with you.

00:32:32.079 --> 00:32:33.799
Dad, here.

00:32:33.799 --> 00:32:35.599
I got tea for you.

00:32:35.599 --> 00:32:36.440
It's Pu'er tea.

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:37.639
Pu'er tea is great.

00:32:37.639 --> 00:32:39.760
It can be brewed many times.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.839
Mom, this is for...

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:50.680
It's fine.

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.209
The flowers will bloom again next year.

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:55.040
The tea crumbled, but as long as
the flavor doesn't change, it's fine.

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.360
It had to be broken open up
sooner or later.

00:32:56.368 --> 00:32:57.390
It's fine.

00:32:57.399 --> 00:32:59.159
Come on, drink some soup.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:00.480
Son,

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.680
today,

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.000
I was a bit impulsive.

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.480
Dad, Mom, listen,

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:09.879
this project I'm working on

00:33:09.879 --> 00:33:10.680
is about to wrap up.

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:12.720
Once it's wrapped,
and I get my commission,

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.680
I'll go pay the down payment right away.

00:33:14.879 --> 00:33:16.680
You can already pay a down payment?

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:17.440
Yeah.

00:33:17.839 --> 00:33:20.720
But Mingri Apartments is so expensive.

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.000
Your commission is that high?

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.399
It is.

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:24.159
Yeah.

00:33:24.159 --> 00:33:25.000
I was just

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000
saying that to Mr. Ge.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.599
I've known him for decades.

00:33:27.599 --> 00:33:28.720
I couldn't help myself

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:29.760
from bragging.

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:31.399
Don't put pressure on yourself, okay?

00:33:31.399 --> 00:33:33.480
There's no need to rush
to pay that down payment.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.359
Right.

00:33:34.359 --> 00:33:35.200
Dad, Mom,

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.829
put your minds at ease.

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:38.391
That was my plan from the start.

00:33:38.391 --> 00:33:40.613
Who knew today would just happen
to be such a coincidence?

00:33:40.613 --> 00:33:41.720
Once I pay the down payment,

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:42.960
I'll take you both to see it.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.359
Really?

00:33:47.879 --> 00:33:48.960
Good.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.040
Come on, eat.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:53.960
How about

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:55.520
a drink?

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:57.399
Sure.

00:33:57.839 --> 00:33:59.399
It's the Chinese New Year.

00:34:00.857 --> 00:34:02.240
Come on, I'll hold it down for you.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:06.440
Here.

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.360
You said you'd give yourself

00:34:31.759 --> 00:34:33.040
one year.

00:34:33.599 --> 00:34:35.040
It's been a year.

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:37.400
Isn't it time you came back
to work for the family?

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:40.719
Thank you for being willing
to give me that time.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.400
And I really did find

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:44.960
a place where I can pursue my ideals
and prove my worth.

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.119
I hope you can support me

00:34:47.119 --> 00:34:48.719
and let me stay at Tengda.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.239
Isn't it still just a game company?

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.960
Tengda isn't even as good as Sky Fire
in the industry.

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.960
Tengda is a startup,

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.960
so, of course,
it's smaller than Sky Fire,

00:34:59.159 --> 00:35:00.279
but it's different.

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.040
The boss is a man of vision.

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:03.960
Besides,

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.546
the gaming industry
is pretty interesting too.

00:35:07.257 --> 00:35:09.546
Could you please put aside your bias?

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:10.920
Wouldn't the family business

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.857
be a better place for you
to prove your worth?

00:35:13.146 --> 00:35:15.320
The way you're running yourself
ragged every day,

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:16.639
doing errands for other people

00:35:16.639 --> 00:35:17.960
for such a small salary,

00:35:18.079 --> 00:35:19.960
how does that prove your worth?

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:22.440
Stop talking.

00:35:25.759 --> 00:35:27.520
My year-end bonus this year

00:35:28.239 --> 00:35:29.320
is six figures.

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.440
So what? It's just...

00:35:36.759 --> 00:35:38.480
This is the red wine I bought you

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.599
with my year-end bonus,

00:35:40.599 --> 00:35:42.000
as a small token of respect.

00:35:47.639 --> 00:35:48.480
Actually,

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.920
when you came to this place,

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.520
your dad and I were really
worried about you.

00:35:52.759 --> 00:35:55.679
But I can see that at this company,

00:35:56.159 --> 00:35:57.920
you're in a really good state,

00:35:58.119 --> 00:35:59.480
and you seem happy.

00:35:59.639 --> 00:36:00.960
Tell me about it,

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.480
what's actually different

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.000
between this company and that one?

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:11.400
Oh, there's so much.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.719
Our boss, Pei Qian,

00:36:12.719 --> 00:36:14.639
works in a run-down office,

00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:16.069
but he gave us employees

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:18.880
F4-rated (Highest-level
eco-certification standard) working spaces.

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.639
And he's really innovative
with game-making too.

00:36:22.119 --> 00:36:24.079
Dad, give me your phone.

00:36:26.639 --> 00:36:28.040
Let me show you this game

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.639
called The Lonely Road.

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:32.119
It's the game he started out with.

00:36:32.559 --> 00:36:33.639
It's a small game,

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.840
but he incorporated
his own philosophy into it.

00:36:36.239 --> 00:36:38.400
And then there's Divine General Pact.

00:36:38.502 --> 00:36:40.035
(The Lonely Road)
Its gacha system

00:36:40.035 --> 00:36:42.346
is designed to be fair,
without pay-to-win.

00:36:43.279 --> 00:36:45.320
Everyone thought it wouldn't make it,

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:46.960
but it blew up.

00:36:47.119 --> 00:36:49.960
After that, we made
Deserted Island Sharpshooter.

00:36:50.279 --> 00:36:52.960
He went to Sky Fire for a visit,

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.279
got influenced,

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:55.759
made a wrong call,

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:58.159
and he took the loss himself.

00:36:58.159 --> 00:37:00.440
He even apologized to all of us,

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:02.960
saying the responsibility wasn't on us.

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.960
That really surprised me.

00:37:07.435 --> 00:37:08.502
Is he a rich kid?

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.440
How did he build his business?

00:37:11.599 --> 00:37:12.960
I don't think so.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.079
From how he spends,
it doesn't really seem like it.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:19.840
He probably put all his money
into the company.

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.040
He didn't even buy a car.

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.520
He rides a shared bike everywhere.

00:37:25.146 --> 00:37:27.435
Interesting. A self-made guy.

00:37:29.391 --> 00:37:31.457
Who knows if he's actually any good?

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:34.119
What if he's just setting you up
and conning you?

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.279
Dad,

00:37:35.279 --> 00:37:36.320
our boss, Mr. Pei,

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.159
isn't like you business people.

00:37:38.159 --> 00:37:39.800
Always looking miserable,

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.480
afraid of getting scammed or being used.

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:45.320
Besides, he treats everyone really well.

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:46.840
Every time he runs a project,

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.320
he's totally confident,
calm and relaxed.

00:37:49.559 --> 00:37:51.000
He's nothing like you guys.

00:37:52.279 --> 00:37:53.159
Is that so?

00:37:53.235 --> 00:37:55.480
Sounds like I'll have to go
meet this Mr. Pei myself.

00:37:57.759 --> 00:37:59.840
Hello, Ms. Mei, Happy Chinese New Year.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:00.599
Who is this?

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.040
I'm the one who previously

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.840
came to view the unit
at Mingri Apartments,

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:04.639
Pei Qian.

00:38:04.639 --> 00:38:05.559
Mr. Pei!

00:38:05.559 --> 00:38:06.960
I haven't heard from you in ages.

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.279
Are you still interested in

00:38:08.279 --> 00:38:09.480
a unit at Mingri Apartments?

00:38:09.679 --> 00:38:11.159
I thought you weren't buying.

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:13.119
Of course, I'm buying.

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:14.559
There aren't many units left.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:17.149
If you're serious,
I can hold one for you,

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:18.035
but you need to hurry.

00:38:18.057 --> 00:38:19.620
When I get back
after the Chinese New Year,

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:20.613
we can sign the contract.

00:38:20.613 --> 00:38:21.400
Deal.

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:22.880
Then I'll prepare the contract.

00:38:22.946 --> 00:38:25.391
I'll come back after the Chinese
New Year to sign it. Thanks.

00:39:04.213 --> 00:39:05.320
(Dear viewers...)

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:06.239
Has it started yet?

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:08.759
It's started.

00:39:08.759 --> 00:39:11.109
(Welcome to Dream Voice.)

00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:13.480
(Dream Voice, singing for you.)

00:39:13.502 --> 00:39:14.590
(Dream Voice)
(I'm your old friend...)

00:39:14.599 --> 00:39:16.639
I just love watching this talent show.

00:39:16.639 --> 00:39:17.880
They sing so well.

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:19.840
(Join the music starship)

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:22.639
(and cruise through
the galaxy of melody...)

00:39:22.639 --> 00:39:24.239
This is great.

00:39:24.239 --> 00:39:25.480
What are you watching, Mom?

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:27.400
That original singer from Jinchuan

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:28.320
is Chen Lei.

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:32.119
(Next, please welcome with applause)

00:39:32.119 --> 00:39:34.840
(the original singer from Jinchuan,)

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.840
(Chen Lei.)

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.119
It's him?

00:39:44.119 --> 00:39:46.239
Son, you know Chen Lei?

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:47.960
I...

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:49.119
Ever since Chen Lei showed up,

00:39:49.119 --> 00:39:50.840
your mom barely pays attention
to me anymore.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.440
What are you talking about?

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:54.119
He's just a resident singer,

00:39:54.119 --> 00:39:55.440
but he sings so well.

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.840
That's no small thing.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.279
Son, do you think he can win?

00:39:59.279 --> 00:40:00.119
He...

No way.

00:40:13.719 --> 00:40:15.320
Hey, why are you talking like that?

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.639
Just like your dad,

00:40:16.639 --> 00:40:17.880
jealous, bitter, and resentful.

00:40:18.279 --> 00:40:19.960
What would I be jealous of?

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.759
Son, you're not watching?

00:40:45.146 --> 00:40:46.630
Happy Chinese New Year, everyone!

00:40:46.639 --> 00:40:48.079
I'm sending out red envelopes!

00:40:49.013 --> 00:40:50.840
Wishing you prosperity
and great fortune!

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.000
(Ms. Xin)

00:41:01.639 --> 00:41:02.440
Hello?

00:41:02.835 --> 00:41:04.480
Hello, Ms. Xin. Happy Chinese New Year.

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.759
Hello? What did you say?

00:41:05.759 --> 00:41:06.639
I can't hear you.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.840
I know you've worked hard this year,

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:10.719
so I wanted to send you a red envelope.

00:41:10.719 --> 00:41:12.440
At least a thousand yuan, right?

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:13.440
But as the boss,

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.413
I can't play favorites.

00:41:14.413 --> 00:41:16.040
I have to send them
to other employees too,

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:16.840
don't you agree?

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:19.159
It's too noisy here. Let's talk later.

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:20.119
Hello?

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:21.960
(Ms. Xin)

00:41:26.599 --> 00:41:28.320
Happy Chinese New Year, everyone.

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:29.613
After the holiday, please come

00:41:29.635 --> 00:41:31.270
and support M&Y Internet Cafe more.

00:41:31.279 --> 00:41:32.559
I'm sending out red envelopes!

00:41:41.639 --> 00:41:44.759

After the holiday, please come

Wishing everyone a happy

00:42:46.746 --> 00:42:49.080
I'm a project manager now.

00:42:49.559 --> 00:42:50.840
Wouldn't that be inappropriate?

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:54.480
I'll send one.
