00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:51.072
One night,

00:00:51.573 --> 00:00:53.950
I searched for an answer

00:00:55.034 --> 00:00:56.703
as to why our souls had to be switched.

00:01:02.792 --> 00:01:04.711
Perhaps I knew it then.

00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:08.923
Ever since our souls were switched,
perhaps I knew that…

00:01:11.134 --> 00:01:12.719
fighting against your ordeals,

00:01:14.262 --> 00:01:15.972
protecting your people,

00:01:20.393 --> 00:01:23.188
and taking the world with you
was the fate laid out before me.

00:01:25.648 --> 00:01:27.317
Perhaps I also knew

00:01:28.318 --> 00:01:29.777
that one day,

00:01:30.612 --> 00:01:32.488
I would die for you as well.

00:01:35.617 --> 00:01:36.951
And if that's my fate,

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:42.540
I will gladly accept it.

00:01:44.292 --> 00:01:45.668
No!

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.070
It's gone.

00:02:43.601 --> 00:02:44.894
It can't be…

00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:28.438
What should we do
with the Grand Prince's body?

00:03:29.522 --> 00:03:30.648
Let the river bury it.

00:03:31.232 --> 00:03:33.526
The fish won't waste it.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.279
You made a promise to us.

00:03:36.362 --> 00:03:38.156
Please keep your word.

00:03:58.468 --> 00:03:59.802
Make the preparations!

00:04:01.596 --> 00:04:03.264
I'm heading to the palace.

00:04:13.441 --> 00:04:16.027
The current isn't strong enough
to carry him downstream.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.905
If he had fallen from the cliff,
he should be around here.

00:04:19.572 --> 00:04:21.074
Did he make it out of the water?

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.451
A path.

00:04:24.035 --> 00:04:27.205
He would've headed toward a path
to get help from people.

00:04:32.168 --> 00:04:33.836
Are you here?

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.923
If you hear me, please answer me!

00:04:59.278 --> 00:05:00.613
It's still beating.

00:05:04.117 --> 00:05:05.326
Hang in there.

00:05:06.536 --> 00:05:08.454
Please hang in there just a little longer.

00:05:14.585 --> 00:05:15.878
What happened?

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:20.383
He was losing so much blood,
I couldn't take him to the capital.

00:05:20.466 --> 00:05:21.759
Tell us what to do.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.762
Warm water and a cotton cloth.

00:05:24.846 --> 00:05:26.305
I'll go get them.

00:05:28.474 --> 00:05:30.935
I need you to get some medicinal herbs.

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:33.020
We need purslane and red sandalwood.

00:05:33.104 --> 00:05:34.480
Go find them now.

00:05:34.564 --> 00:05:36.232
- This way.
- Let's go.

00:05:41.821 --> 00:05:42.655
Oh, dear!

00:05:43.698 --> 00:05:46.284
Don't be alarmed. Physician Hong sent me.

00:05:46.784 --> 00:05:48.619
Did something happen to Eun-jo?

00:05:48.703 --> 00:05:49.829
Here.

00:05:49.912 --> 00:05:52.415
She wants you to find
the medicinal herbs written here.

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:54.292
Who's hurt?

00:06:06.137 --> 00:06:09.807
He will wake up, right? He's invincible.

00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:19.483
Yes.

00:06:21.152 --> 00:06:22.236
For sure, he will.

00:06:23.821 --> 00:06:24.947
Let's go.

00:06:26.532 --> 00:06:29.160
How is he?
Does it look like he'll wake up soon?

00:06:30.203 --> 00:06:32.288
I think we did everything we could.

00:06:33.623 --> 00:06:34.874
Let's wait.

00:06:34.957 --> 00:06:36.459
Let me ask Physician Hong.

00:06:37.752 --> 00:06:38.586
Leave her alone.

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:41.547
I'm sure she wants him to recover
more than anyone else.

00:06:47.386 --> 00:06:48.763
What took you so long?

00:06:48.846 --> 00:06:50.681
I was carrying out His Highness's orders.

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:53.643
Have you been waiting for me?

00:06:54.393 --> 00:06:57.230
We must go to Eun-jo now.

00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:13.496
Do you know what was going through my mind

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.791
when I was running to find you?

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:21.087
"Oh,

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:23.464
he must have run like this too,

00:07:24.757 --> 00:07:26.676
until his lung gave out."

00:07:29.595 --> 00:07:30.972
"He must have run to me,

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:36.477
praying with all his heart

00:07:38.104 --> 00:07:40.231
that I was alive."

00:07:43.067 --> 00:07:45.319
It only just occurred to me.

00:07:50.449 --> 00:07:51.701
Do you remember

00:07:52.285 --> 00:07:54.370
the day my entire family was upset

00:07:54.453 --> 00:07:56.581
when they found out about my wedding?

00:07:56.664 --> 00:07:59.208
Come and take a look at our ornaments.

00:07:59.792 --> 00:08:01.711
Come on. Just have a look.

00:08:03.296 --> 00:08:04.338
You said

00:08:05.006 --> 00:08:08.551
you were following me
so you could pat my shoulder if I cried.

00:08:10.595 --> 00:08:12.054
To tell you the truth,

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:14.807
I was watching you all along.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.231
I was actually

00:08:22.857 --> 00:08:25.318
holding back my laughter.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.043
And I think

00:08:43.252 --> 00:08:44.670
I was actually

00:08:45.338 --> 00:08:46.714
waiting for you.

00:09:02.271 --> 00:09:03.981
Then I realized it.

00:09:05.775 --> 00:09:07.193
"I'm actually

00:09:07.985 --> 00:09:09.862
holding up pretty well now."

00:09:12.073 --> 00:09:14.283
"Now I understand what they mean

00:09:15.493 --> 00:09:18.287
when they say
even a cold winter is bearable

00:09:18.996 --> 00:09:20.373
if you have someone by your side."

00:09:27.672 --> 00:09:29.882
Sorry, I rambled on.

00:09:29.965 --> 00:09:31.300
Long story short,

00:09:31.926 --> 00:09:33.594
please wake up soon.

00:09:44.605 --> 00:09:46.774
Don't sleep for too long.

00:09:49.026 --> 00:09:51.320
I forgot how to get through the winter

00:09:52.405 --> 00:09:53.906
on my own.

00:12:20.511 --> 00:12:22.221
I knew you would wake up.

00:12:24.139 --> 00:12:25.391
How's the pain?

00:12:28.644 --> 00:12:30.229
Are you feeling dizzy?

00:12:30.312 --> 00:12:33.440
Does your head feel foggy?

00:12:37.653 --> 00:12:40.406
Do you know where you are right now?

00:12:40.489 --> 00:12:41.991
Do you remember who you are?

00:12:47.913 --> 00:12:49.248
That's such a relief.

00:12:52.334 --> 00:12:53.544
That's all that matters.

00:12:54.753 --> 00:12:57.131
Lie down. I'll go get some more herbs.

00:13:00.301 --> 00:13:01.760
It's good to see you again,

00:13:03.304 --> 00:13:04.680
Hong Eun-jo.

00:13:12.021 --> 00:13:13.564
I should've protected you.

00:13:18.152 --> 00:13:19.361
You did.

00:13:20.112 --> 00:13:21.655
You saved my life.

00:13:28.579 --> 00:13:29.413
Thank you

00:13:29.997 --> 00:13:31.332
for coming back.

00:13:33.876 --> 00:13:35.419
See, this is exactly

00:13:36.045 --> 00:13:37.254
what makes me too brave.

00:13:39.506 --> 00:13:42.468
I should stop acting
like a prince from a folk tale.

00:13:45.471 --> 00:13:46.388
I'm a real prince.

00:13:56.523 --> 00:13:58.150
How can you joke right now?

00:14:02.321 --> 00:14:03.322
Of course, I can.

00:14:04.073 --> 00:14:04.907
It makes you smile.

00:14:17.544 --> 00:14:19.088
Your Highness!

00:14:20.839 --> 00:14:22.174
You woke up.

00:14:25.594 --> 00:14:29.682
It seems I should have come an hour later.

00:14:29.765 --> 00:14:31.600
No, not at all.

00:14:32.685 --> 00:14:34.395
You came at the right time.

00:14:35.688 --> 00:14:38.983
How did she end up at the cliff alone?
What were you doing?

00:14:39.066 --> 00:14:39.984
I apologize.

00:14:40.067 --> 00:14:41.694
I was looking for this courtesan, No-eul…

00:14:42.569 --> 00:14:43.946
Wait, you two…

00:14:44.697 --> 00:14:47.032
Officer Seo, could you slow down…

00:14:48.409 --> 00:14:49.243
Eun-jo!

00:14:51.912 --> 00:14:53.747
You woke up from the deep sleep.

00:14:54.665 --> 00:14:56.333
The royal physician will reach here soon.

00:14:56.917 --> 00:14:59.336
How did you end up
being attacked by an assassin?

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.380
Well, it's…

00:15:02.089 --> 00:15:04.091
Your Highness, what on earth happened?

00:15:05.134 --> 00:15:07.469
Well…

00:15:07.553 --> 00:15:08.804
Lady Hae-rim.

00:15:08.887 --> 00:15:10.305
I'm Eun-jo.

00:15:13.934 --> 00:15:15.519
It's been a while,

00:15:15.602 --> 00:15:16.895
at least in this body.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:18.814
Oh, dear.

00:15:20.315 --> 00:15:22.484
Are you two switched back now?

00:15:23.402 --> 00:15:24.695
Yes.

00:15:24.778 --> 00:15:25.946
As you can see.

00:15:26.447 --> 00:15:28.615
I apologize.

00:15:28.699 --> 00:15:30.409
I got used to mixing you two up.

00:15:33.037 --> 00:15:34.163
I understand.

00:15:35.456 --> 00:15:37.541
I'm so glad that you're safe.

00:15:39.043 --> 00:15:40.586
I'm so glad you're back.

00:15:41.962 --> 00:15:44.298
I'm sorry,
but the heartfelt reunion can wait.

00:15:45.049 --> 00:15:47.342
Right now, there's something
more important to talk about.

00:15:48.385 --> 00:15:51.430
Who is this fearless wretch
that dared strike at Your Highness?

00:15:55.225 --> 00:15:56.518
Dae-chu.

00:15:56.602 --> 00:15:59.563
Make sure the royal physician
who'll be here soon keeps quiet.

00:15:59.646 --> 00:16:01.774
And tell those at my quarters
I'll be out tonight.

00:16:03.859 --> 00:16:04.860
Wait.

00:16:05.402 --> 00:16:06.653
You must recover first.

00:16:14.787 --> 00:16:16.622
Could you two wait here for a bit?

00:16:19.458 --> 00:16:20.459
What are you doing?

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.422
I don't want to run away anymore.

00:16:28.133 --> 00:16:29.718
Because I happened to see Joseon

00:16:30.219 --> 00:16:33.180
through a woman's eyes.

00:16:34.098 --> 00:16:36.058
The long-exploited tenant farmers,

00:16:36.934 --> 00:16:38.519
the patients at the Hyeminseo,

00:16:39.103 --> 00:16:41.188
the dying children on the street,

00:16:42.064 --> 00:16:44.525
and the courtesans,
scorned and mocked even for their pain.

00:16:45.734 --> 00:16:47.820
These are the people of Joseon I saw

00:16:49.071 --> 00:16:50.239
through that woman's eyes.

00:16:55.119 --> 00:16:56.703
Now, I understand

00:16:56.787 --> 00:16:58.872
how that woman must have felt

00:16:59.748 --> 00:17:01.041
when she had to be a thief.

00:17:04.628 --> 00:17:05.629
Does that mean…

00:17:06.213 --> 00:17:07.714
I want to walk that path with you,

00:17:08.924 --> 00:17:11.009
wherever it leads.

00:17:20.519 --> 00:17:23.272
You want those at your quarters
to believe you're out tonight

00:17:23.355 --> 00:17:24.481
for a reason, right?

00:17:26.316 --> 00:17:27.985
I need the person who tried to kill me

00:17:28.068 --> 00:17:29.736
to believe that I'm dead.

00:17:31.363 --> 00:17:34.032
Did you see the assassin
when you returned to your body?

00:17:35.284 --> 00:17:36.451
Yes.

00:17:37.327 --> 00:17:39.246
Who is it? Do you remember the face?

00:17:39.329 --> 00:17:40.205
Calm down.

00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:43.500
I'm the one who was attacked.
If anyone should be angry, it's me.

00:17:43.876 --> 00:17:44.835
I was attacked too,

00:17:45.419 --> 00:17:46.712
when I was in your body.

00:17:47.588 --> 00:17:48.797
You're right.

00:17:49.423 --> 00:17:51.967
You are entitled to some of my anger.

00:17:53.969 --> 00:17:55.137
Is it

00:17:55.721 --> 00:17:57.639
the Chief Secretary's family?

00:17:59.474 --> 00:18:01.059
This is your son, Seung-jae.

00:18:08.942 --> 00:18:10.444
I will finish up myself.

00:18:10.527 --> 00:18:11.570
Yes, my lord.

00:18:19.828 --> 00:18:21.705
How are things
at the Grand Prince's residence?

00:18:21.788 --> 00:18:24.499
They think it's just
one of his usual nights away.

00:18:24.583 --> 00:18:27.169
And the Queen Dowager
is keeping it under wraps.

00:18:28.962 --> 00:18:31.965
No wonder. It has only been three days.

00:18:33.258 --> 00:18:35.219
Once the Queen Dowager
senses something is amiss,

00:18:35.302 --> 00:18:37.054
she will begin to look for him.

00:18:37.137 --> 00:18:39.264
Make sure there are no mistakes this time.

00:18:40.098 --> 00:18:41.558
I will, Father.

00:18:48.398 --> 00:18:50.150
Is your new court robe not ready yet?

00:18:50.234 --> 00:18:52.694
Since I am to succeed Father
as Chief Royal Secretary,

00:18:52.778 --> 00:18:56.114
I would like to begin
in Father's court robes.

00:18:58.116 --> 00:19:00.577
Would you place this on me?

00:19:08.335 --> 00:19:11.004
Is it because this hat
doesn't have the paper flowers

00:19:11.088 --> 00:19:13.465
like the one Jae-i got for ranking first?

00:19:37.322 --> 00:19:38.573
Father,

00:19:39.616 --> 00:19:40.534
do I look like you?

00:19:41.201 --> 00:19:42.369
It seems a little big on you.

00:19:47.791 --> 00:19:49.209
Right.

00:19:49.293 --> 00:19:51.837
Jae-i hasn't come home
for several days now.

00:19:52.879 --> 00:19:55.173
I sent him away on an errand.

00:19:55.799 --> 00:19:57.926
He will not be home for a while.

00:20:16.194 --> 00:20:18.030
Tell Seung-jae that

00:20:18.697 --> 00:20:20.240
I am

00:20:21.158 --> 00:20:22.326
coming back soon.

00:20:22.409 --> 00:20:24.578
After all this,
have you not learned anything?

00:20:30.334 --> 00:20:32.794
Kill the wench
so there will be no trouble later.

00:20:59.321 --> 00:21:00.906
I will not forget your mercy.

00:21:03.784 --> 00:21:06.161
I ordered you to kill her!

00:21:06.244 --> 00:21:08.747
The State Tribunal's soldiers
will be here soon. Please go.

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:10.040
Did you defy me?

00:21:10.123 --> 00:21:11.500
You must go now!

00:21:16.463 --> 00:21:18.215
What are you doing? Go.

00:21:21.968 --> 00:21:24.763
Lord Left State Councilor,
His Majesty has ordered your return.

00:21:25.305 --> 00:21:28.183
There's a courtesan
running down the mountain.

00:21:28.767 --> 00:21:29.935
Kill her.

00:21:32.687 --> 00:21:35.440
And this man defied my command.

00:21:35.524 --> 00:21:37.109
Confine him to the State Tribunal.

00:21:37.192 --> 00:21:39.361
Let him see no light of day

00:21:39.444 --> 00:21:41.947
until I command otherwise.

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:43.365
Arrest him.

00:21:54.584 --> 00:21:55.919
What's the matter?

00:21:56.002 --> 00:21:57.796
Tell Kim Seung-baek that I'm here.

00:21:59.464 --> 00:22:01.967
I've been ordered
to never tell anyone who's confined--

00:22:09.057 --> 00:22:10.559
No one will know

00:22:11.226 --> 00:22:13.061
as long as you keep your mouth shut.

00:22:21.987 --> 00:22:24.614
Im Sa-hyeong, that rat was poison,

00:22:25.282 --> 00:22:27.868
and you fed me that poison.

00:22:28.451 --> 00:22:29.995
Kill me.

00:22:30.078 --> 00:22:31.079
As you wish.

00:22:50.849 --> 00:22:52.309
Why don't you

00:22:52.392 --> 00:22:53.602
just kill me?

00:22:56.479 --> 00:22:58.356
I want you to live a long life.

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:01.860
You promised
we would grow old together, right?

00:23:06.114 --> 00:23:08.742
From now on,
you will live a life that makes you wish

00:23:08.825 --> 00:23:10.243
you were dead every day.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.466
When will the incense be replenished?

00:23:24.549 --> 00:23:25.842
I heard that

00:23:25.926 --> 00:23:28.428
an issue had arisen
while importing it from the Ming.

00:23:29.012 --> 00:23:32.224
I asked the Left State Councilor
to see to it at once.

00:23:49.824 --> 00:23:50.951
You see,

00:23:51.034 --> 00:23:53.912
I grew up sheltered, so I hate sweating.

00:23:54.746 --> 00:23:55.997
So stop resisting

00:23:56.748 --> 00:23:57.832
and let me arrest you.

00:23:59.251 --> 00:24:01.586
I grew up the hard way,
so I love fighting.

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:02.879
So stop running away

00:24:02.963 --> 00:24:04.422
and take my blade.

00:24:35.704 --> 00:24:36.997
I said I didn't want to run.

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.873
I told him not to run away.

00:24:48.842 --> 00:24:50.635
Welcome, Your Majesty.

00:24:50.719 --> 00:24:52.387
What brings you all the way to…

00:25:00.729 --> 00:25:02.272
It's good to see you again,

00:25:02.355 --> 00:25:03.440
Lady Sukeui.

00:25:05.108 --> 00:25:06.318
Your Highness.

00:25:06.985 --> 00:25:08.069
What brings you here?

00:25:09.279 --> 00:25:12.490
I hear the air here is fresh.

00:25:14.159 --> 00:25:16.202
I may need to take some time to rest soon,

00:25:16.286 --> 00:25:18.663
and I'm hoping you could help me.

00:25:20.623 --> 00:25:22.834
How may I help you?

00:25:23.793 --> 00:25:24.836
First,

00:25:24.919 --> 00:25:26.838
I would like to go on a hunt.

00:25:27.464 --> 00:25:28.757
A hunt?

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:34.304
Stay back.

00:25:34.387 --> 00:25:36.848
Don't try anything, or the kid dies.

00:25:36.931 --> 00:25:38.558
Calm down.

00:25:38.641 --> 00:25:41.269
Let me take one step back.

00:25:42.187 --> 00:25:43.396
I'll take two.

00:25:55.867 --> 00:25:58.036
What animal are you hunting?

00:25:59.204 --> 00:26:00.413
A young viper.

00:26:05.085 --> 00:26:07.337
Very well. Thank you, everyone.

00:26:08.171 --> 00:26:09.798
Congratulations on your return.

00:26:09.881 --> 00:26:11.424
Congratulations.

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:20.767
Lord Chief State Councilor,

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:23.603
as an apology for my past impertinence,

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:25.730
allow me to pour you a drink.

00:26:46.167 --> 00:26:47.252
Oh, dear.

00:26:47.877 --> 00:26:49.421
I must be drunk.

00:26:54.259 --> 00:26:56.553
I'm here to raise a toast.

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.267
A toast is meant to be bitter.

00:27:12.318 --> 00:27:14.154
I'm sure it is, to you.

00:27:15.196 --> 00:27:18.658
Grand Prince Dowol arrives!

00:28:05.747 --> 00:28:07.874
Your Highness.

00:28:09.209 --> 00:28:10.502
What's wrong?

00:28:14.881 --> 00:28:16.466
Dae-chu, watch closely.

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:18.927
That's the look of a man

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:20.553
who's just seen a dead man.

00:28:20.637 --> 00:28:23.181
And a man who won't live much longer.

00:28:23.932 --> 00:28:25.683
Black Sword!

00:28:33.566 --> 00:28:34.734
Someone's calling you.

00:28:37.195 --> 00:28:38.655
I apologize.

00:28:39.739 --> 00:28:40.782
Didn't I tell you?

00:28:40.865 --> 00:28:42.992
I'm here to raise a toast.

00:28:43.076 --> 00:28:45.745
This criminal attempted
to assassinate His Highness. Seize him!

00:28:45.829 --> 00:28:46.746
Yes, sir!

00:28:57.173 --> 00:28:59.843
Your Highness, I beg for your mercy.

00:28:59.926 --> 00:29:01.928
Beg your father.

00:29:02.846 --> 00:29:04.472
And beg him harder.

00:29:07.183 --> 00:29:08.476
Did you hear that?

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:11.896
Lord Im Sa-hyeong's eldest son

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:14.107
tried to kill the Grand Prince!

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:15.483
What?

00:29:15.567 --> 00:29:16.651
I know, right?

00:29:16.734 --> 00:29:17.819
You see,

00:29:17.902 --> 00:29:20.196
It's like one of us slaves

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.782
trying to kill the lord's brother!

00:29:22.866 --> 00:29:23.908
Exactly!

00:29:25.118 --> 00:29:27.036
If that's true,

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:30.957
his entire family will be beheaded,
all three generations.

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.251
It's an exemplary punishment,
as the scholars say.

00:29:33.334 --> 00:29:35.587
Wait, you…

00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:38.756
You're pretty and smart?

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:40.258
- This isn't the time.
- Right.

00:29:42.218 --> 00:29:44.762
Anyway, even ignorant folks
like us know that.

00:29:44.846 --> 00:29:47.348
Those nobles would certainly know.

00:29:47.432 --> 00:29:48.433
Absolutely!

00:29:56.608 --> 00:29:58.443
- Ma'am.
- Eun-jo.

00:29:58.526 --> 00:30:00.111
- Eun-jo.
- Eun-jo.

00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:02.739
Eun-jo, we did as you said.

00:30:02.822 --> 00:30:06.117
We went to every tavern in the capital
and spread the word.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.368
Thank you.

00:30:07.452 --> 00:30:09.829
But do you really think

00:30:10.413 --> 00:30:13.249
our gossip could get
Lord Im's eldest son into trouble?

00:30:13.333 --> 00:30:14.292
It'll pressure him.

00:30:14.375 --> 00:30:17.462
They won't be able to deny
something everyone knows.

00:30:18.671 --> 00:30:19.672
Oh, dear.

00:30:19.756 --> 00:30:22.175
My heart is still pounding.

00:30:22.258 --> 00:30:25.136
I had no idea the aide
who helped me was the Grand Prince.

00:30:25.219 --> 00:30:26.888
What are you talking about?

00:30:26.971 --> 00:30:30.016
Are you saying
your heart is pounding for another man?

00:30:30.099 --> 00:30:31.851
What? That's not what I meant.

00:30:31.935 --> 00:30:33.770
I told you.

00:30:34.562 --> 00:30:37.774
I told you he didn't look like
some nobody off the street.

00:30:37.857 --> 00:30:38.942
Nobody?

00:30:39.859 --> 00:30:41.444
You wretched bastard…

00:30:41.527 --> 00:30:42.737
- Wretched?
- Wretched.

00:30:45.156 --> 00:30:48.451
- Bastard?
- Bastard.

00:30:48.534 --> 00:30:49.953
Enough! Quiet!

00:30:50.828 --> 00:30:51.996
- Quiet.
- Quiet.

00:30:53.957 --> 00:30:54.791
So?

00:30:54.874 --> 00:30:57.085
- What's happening from now on?
- Right.

00:30:57.168 --> 00:30:59.629
Soon, they will come together like we did.

00:30:59.712 --> 00:31:01.339
The Royal Confucian Academy's students.

00:31:01.422 --> 00:31:05.635
Please, Your Majesty!

00:31:06.302 --> 00:31:08.054
Your Majesty!

00:31:08.137 --> 00:31:11.641
To threaten the Grand Prince's life
is a grave insult to the realm!

00:31:11.724 --> 00:31:13.601
Father would have done this.

00:31:14.602 --> 00:31:18.523
This must be punished severely!

00:31:18.606 --> 00:31:21.943
We beseech Your Majesty!

00:31:22.026 --> 00:31:25.738
We beseech Your Majesty!

00:31:26.489 --> 00:31:28.449
Your Majesty!

00:31:28.533 --> 00:31:33.287
Please investigate Im Seung-jae's family!

00:31:34.122 --> 00:31:37.417
Im Sa-hyeong is behind this crime!

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:41.671
We beseech Your Majesty!

00:31:41.754 --> 00:31:45.842
We beseech Your Majesty!

00:31:58.521 --> 00:32:00.064
Lord Im Sa-hyeong's eldest son,

00:32:00.148 --> 00:32:01.524
Im Seung-jae, is the criminal.

00:32:02.358 --> 00:32:06.112
Here are the Grand Prince's palace maid
and guard bought off by him.

00:32:10.616 --> 00:32:12.618
This man claimed that

00:32:12.702 --> 00:32:14.704
he killed them on Im Seung-jae's orders.

00:32:18.499 --> 00:32:19.542
Get to the point.

00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:25.673
There is no way Im Seung-jae could have
plotted something so vile by himself.

00:32:27.508 --> 00:32:30.511
We must investigate whether
the Left State Councilor was behind this.

00:32:34.182 --> 00:32:35.808
Is that true, Left State Councilor?

00:32:44.484 --> 00:32:48.279
Your Majesty,
this was done by the criminal alone.

00:32:56.079 --> 00:32:57.914
What do you think should be done?

00:32:59.749 --> 00:33:03.002
To threaten the royal family
is to shake the foundations of the realm.

00:33:03.086 --> 00:33:06.631
No precedent of mercy must be set.

00:33:09.133 --> 00:33:10.218
Father.

00:33:14.639 --> 00:33:17.100
I submit that
he deserves beheading, Your Majesty.

00:33:27.026 --> 00:33:28.569
Beheading, Father?

00:33:29.237 --> 00:33:30.780
I don't want to die!

00:33:31.489 --> 00:33:34.659
No criminal bears our family's name.

00:33:49.882 --> 00:33:51.843
As the Left State Councilor has advised,

00:33:52.385 --> 00:33:53.386
punish the criminal.

00:33:53.469 --> 00:33:54.595
Yes, Your Majesty!

00:33:56.055 --> 00:33:59.559
Father!

00:33:59.642 --> 00:34:00.768
Father!

00:34:03.312 --> 00:34:04.313
Father!

00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:17.702
There's an old saying

00:34:18.369 --> 00:34:20.288
that children are nothing but trouble.

00:34:31.465 --> 00:34:32.550
Father!

00:34:54.155 --> 00:34:55.198
Let His Highness know.

00:34:55.948 --> 00:34:59.118
Your Highness,
the Left State Councilor is here.

00:34:59.202 --> 00:35:00.536
Let him in.

00:35:13.925 --> 00:35:14.926
Your Highness.

00:35:16.844 --> 00:35:17.929
Have a seat.

00:35:27.021 --> 00:35:30.942
My child has committed
such a grave offense

00:35:31.651 --> 00:35:34.779
that I dare not even ask
after your health, Your Highness.

00:35:38.032 --> 00:35:39.992
I could not attend
the royal interrogation today.

00:35:40.618 --> 00:35:43.412
As you know, I cannot move freely
because of the injuries.

00:35:45.748 --> 00:35:47.750
My son will be sent into exile

00:35:47.833 --> 00:35:49.710
and then be beheaded.

00:35:52.546 --> 00:35:54.298
So that's how it ended.

00:35:54.382 --> 00:35:56.676
They say you may clean up your own act,

00:35:56.759 --> 00:35:58.970
but you can't clean up your children's.

00:36:00.346 --> 00:36:01.889
This is entirely

00:36:03.057 --> 00:36:04.433
my failing.

00:36:06.978 --> 00:36:10.106
"You may bear children,
but not their hearts."

00:36:10.189 --> 00:36:11.357
That's what they say as well.

00:36:13.484 --> 00:36:15.945
I will trust that the blade that harmed me

00:36:17.196 --> 00:36:18.656
did not carry

00:36:19.532 --> 00:36:20.825
your intent.

00:36:27.498 --> 00:36:29.583
Just as you and the Grand Prince expected.

00:36:29.667 --> 00:36:32.586
Lord Im is the kind of man
who would even sacrifice his own child

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:34.213
if he could save himself.

00:36:34.297 --> 00:36:38.342
Just like what he did to my lord
when he was the Chief Secretary.

00:36:38.426 --> 00:36:41.345
We caught the young viper.
The hunt was a success.

00:36:42.763 --> 00:36:45.725
All this was made possible
because you rallied the scholars.

00:36:47.601 --> 00:36:50.187
The Grand Prince learned about me
and came to me.

00:36:50.271 --> 00:36:52.898
He said,
once Im Sa-hyeong's family is rooted out,

00:36:53.482 --> 00:36:55.109
we would discuss the rest in due time.

00:36:56.277 --> 00:36:57.778
I'm aware of it.

00:36:58.362 --> 00:37:01.073
I accepted his offer, but I'm worried.

00:37:01.157 --> 00:37:03.909
If he makes a move before he recovers,
things could be worse.

00:37:03.993 --> 00:37:05.911
We might not even be able to begin then.

00:37:07.121 --> 00:37:09.081
I'm aware of that as well.

00:37:10.875 --> 00:37:12.209
Are the two of you

00:37:13.627 --> 00:37:14.962
deeply in love?

00:37:18.341 --> 00:37:19.550
I need to know

00:37:20.343 --> 00:37:22.219
if your love will help us

00:37:23.387 --> 00:37:24.555
or get in our way.

00:37:30.269 --> 00:37:32.188
Until we change the world,

00:37:32.271 --> 00:37:34.023
{\an8}I'm just Gil-dong.

00:37:34.899 --> 00:37:37.151
Please protect him by his side
as Gil-dong.

00:37:38.319 --> 00:37:39.987
Right now, you are the only one

00:37:40.988 --> 00:37:42.281
who can look after him.

00:37:45.743 --> 00:37:47.661
Yes, I'm already doing so.

00:37:56.253 --> 00:37:57.254
Officer Seo…

00:37:58.464 --> 00:37:59.507
It's me.

00:38:05.262 --> 00:38:06.639
So this is it.

00:38:06.722 --> 00:38:09.517
The herbs you made Dae-chu brew every day.

00:38:11.602 --> 00:38:12.770
Why are you out again?

00:38:12.853 --> 00:38:15.606
The royal physician allowed me to go out.

00:38:15.689 --> 00:38:19.276
The interrogation ended today.
You should at least stay in for today.

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:22.613
You barely got any rest.
I can't believe you crawled out already.

00:38:22.696 --> 00:38:24.115
I walked out.

00:38:28.744 --> 00:38:29.870
You look gaunt.

00:38:30.955 --> 00:38:32.957
I hear you haven't been eating
because you're busy.

00:38:35.251 --> 00:38:37.044
Dae-chu has been ratting on me?

00:38:37.878 --> 00:38:40.423
I should go back. Your nagging
is more bitter than my medicine.

00:38:40.506 --> 00:38:42.967
It's because you took it
on an empty stomach.

00:38:47.972 --> 00:38:49.598
Since you're already out, follow me.

00:38:50.975 --> 00:38:52.101
Where?

00:38:55.229 --> 00:38:58.315
This can't be better
than the broody hens your family raises.

00:38:58.399 --> 00:39:00.860
Stop trying to eat
all my family's chickens

00:39:00.943 --> 00:39:02.403
and eat up.

00:39:02.486 --> 00:39:04.738
You need to eat well
for the medicine to work.

00:39:05.865 --> 00:39:07.366
Are you that concerned about my body?

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:09.743
Well, I was in that body
until just a few days ago.

00:39:10.327 --> 00:39:11.787
It feels closer to me.

00:39:11.871 --> 00:39:13.038
In that case,

00:39:13.122 --> 00:39:14.957
since I've become closer to your chicken…

00:39:18.294 --> 00:39:20.254
Finish this, and have another one.

00:39:20.337 --> 00:39:22.798
I promised
I would take good care of your body.

00:39:23.883 --> 00:39:25.759
Who did you promise? Take it back.

00:39:25.843 --> 00:39:28.179
I can't. It's already decided.

00:39:30.806 --> 00:39:32.016
Come on. Eat up.

00:39:38.314 --> 00:39:39.523
Switched souls…

00:39:40.983 --> 00:39:43.235
It's something
that would only happen in folk tales.

00:39:47.406 --> 00:39:48.824
Wait…

00:39:48.908 --> 00:39:51.368
Who was I in love with then?

00:39:56.415 --> 00:39:57.625
His Highness?

00:39:58.542 --> 00:40:01.170
Lady Hae-rim of the Shin family?

00:40:05.257 --> 00:40:06.675
Eun-jo?

00:40:09.678 --> 00:40:11.263
I brought some warm water.

00:40:14.808 --> 00:40:15.643
Kkot-sim,

00:40:16.519 --> 00:40:18.646
is it possible to hold two people dear

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:20.648
at the same time?

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.484
There you go again, talking nonsense.

00:40:24.818 --> 00:40:26.153
I'll get some cold water.

00:40:33.744 --> 00:40:35.746
I finished the whole chicken, as you said,

00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:37.039
and you don't seem that happy.

00:40:38.666 --> 00:40:39.667
Because I didn't eat two?

00:40:40.876 --> 00:40:42.002
No.

00:40:44.129 --> 00:40:46.257
Let's go. I'll eat three chickens.

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:47.633
No.

00:40:47.716 --> 00:40:49.385
That's really not it.

00:40:52.054 --> 00:40:56.100
I'm just worried
we might switch bodies again.

00:40:57.601 --> 00:40:58.852
Even when I'm fine,

00:40:59.436 --> 00:41:01.063
that worry creeps in sometimes.

00:41:01.647 --> 00:41:02.898
Don't worry.

00:41:02.982 --> 00:41:04.817
We won't switch again.

00:41:06.944 --> 00:41:08.112
Because I will never let us

00:41:08.195 --> 00:41:10.906
be in mortal danger again.

00:41:12.408 --> 00:41:13.492
How do you know?

00:41:15.369 --> 00:41:16.328
I just feel like

00:41:16.912 --> 00:41:20.416
my soul really has settled
into my body this time.

00:41:20.499 --> 00:41:22.418
That's it?

00:41:22.501 --> 00:41:23.711
If you're so worried,

00:41:23.794 --> 00:41:25.462
I can tag along with you forever.

00:41:27.881 --> 00:41:31.260
You know being apart
only makes things hard for both of us.

00:41:32.303 --> 00:41:33.971
So I have no choice

00:41:34.054 --> 00:41:36.181
but to tag along with you everywhere.

00:41:39.518 --> 00:41:40.978
Just accept it.

00:41:41.061 --> 00:41:42.938
It's our harsh fate.

00:41:46.775 --> 00:41:47.776
Wait.

00:41:48.861 --> 00:41:49.987
Who's there?

00:41:58.537 --> 00:41:59.663
It's me.

00:41:59.747 --> 00:42:01.248
You scared me.

00:42:01.332 --> 00:42:02.750
Why are you hiding like some thief?

00:42:02.833 --> 00:42:04.209
You told me to follow you

00:42:04.293 --> 00:42:07.129
discreetly and swiftly, like a thief,
Your Highness.

00:42:08.005 --> 00:42:09.423
Stop saying "thief."

00:42:09.506 --> 00:42:11.425
You're embarrassing a real thief here.

00:42:11.508 --> 00:42:12.968
Right.

00:42:15.888 --> 00:42:18.891
Officer Seo, you came just in time.

00:42:18.974 --> 00:42:21.727
Have you noticed anything strange

00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:23.979
while observing the Im family?

00:42:24.063 --> 00:42:25.064
What do you mean?

00:42:25.147 --> 00:42:27.274
My young master said

00:42:27.358 --> 00:42:29.818
that he hadn't seen Jae-i lately.

00:42:29.902 --> 00:42:31.737
I asked Seok-sam to look into it,

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:34.365
and he said
everyone was keeping quiet about it.

00:42:34.448 --> 00:42:36.283
Something doesn't feel right.

00:42:36.367 --> 00:42:38.035
And why now?

00:42:41.121 --> 00:42:42.831
Actually, I've been looking for him too.

00:42:44.333 --> 00:42:46.919
I thought I should meet him

00:42:47.002 --> 00:42:48.879
before bringing down his family.

00:42:59.223 --> 00:43:00.974
What took you so long…

00:43:11.068 --> 00:43:12.361
What are you doing here?

00:43:13.862 --> 00:43:16.073
The Grand Prince has a message for you.

00:43:16.824 --> 00:43:18.033
He could've come himself.

00:43:19.243 --> 00:43:20.536
I wanted to come for him.

00:43:21.328 --> 00:43:22.162
I had to.

00:43:23.914 --> 00:43:25.874
So say it already and go.

00:43:25.958 --> 00:43:28.377
You don't want my father to find out.

00:43:29.753 --> 00:43:32.506
He doesn't know
what happened to his brother.

00:43:36.468 --> 00:43:37.761
The Grand Prince said

00:43:38.637 --> 00:43:42.474
he would accept any blame.

00:43:43.225 --> 00:43:44.226
He really meant it.

00:43:45.936 --> 00:43:46.770
"Blame?"

00:43:52.568 --> 00:43:54.153
Something happened outside, didn't it?

00:43:56.405 --> 00:43:57.322
You'll find out soon.

00:44:00.951 --> 00:44:02.870
I hope it won't hurt you too much.

00:44:02.953 --> 00:44:04.913
And I mean it.

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:18.051
Yes, Your Highness.

00:44:28.854 --> 00:44:31.482
First, an arrow. Now, a sword?

00:44:32.274 --> 00:44:34.067
What's next?

00:44:34.151 --> 00:44:36.195
Whatever it is,
I can't let this happen again.

00:44:36.278 --> 00:44:38.405
You already broke my heart too many times.

00:44:38.489 --> 00:44:40.783
Now that sounds personal.

00:44:44.369 --> 00:44:45.496
How is he?

00:44:47.289 --> 00:44:48.874
He's recovering fast.

00:44:48.957 --> 00:44:51.376
His Highness is truly blessed.

00:44:53.003 --> 00:44:53.837
You heard him.

00:44:53.921 --> 00:44:58.008
This is partly due
to the excellent initial treatment.

00:44:58.091 --> 00:45:00.469
Oh, that's part of my blessing.

00:45:01.053 --> 00:45:02.221
I met a great physician.

00:45:03.597 --> 00:45:04.890
You may all leave now.

00:45:16.902 --> 00:45:19.112
What on earth are you doing outside?

00:45:19.196 --> 00:45:20.948
Why is the Im family trying to harm you?

00:45:22.282 --> 00:45:23.617
Mother.

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:26.203
A mother senses her child's danger
before anyone else.

00:45:26.286 --> 00:45:27.204
Tell me what happened.

00:45:28.539 --> 00:45:29.665
One day,

00:45:30.624 --> 00:45:31.833
I will tell you everything.

00:45:34.545 --> 00:45:35.420
Can I trust you?

00:45:37.005 --> 00:45:38.298
Please don't worry.

00:45:40.425 --> 00:45:41.468
I know

00:45:42.177 --> 00:45:43.554
what I'm doing.

00:45:54.439 --> 00:45:56.233
I know that look on his face.

00:45:57.150 --> 00:45:58.777
It's like the Gyeongo Year.

00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:00.320
He had that same look then.

00:46:01.446 --> 00:46:03.240
What's the matter, Your Majesty?

00:46:03.323 --> 00:46:05.242
Send for Lady Sukeui
as soon as the sun rises.

00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:29.641
Father.

00:46:35.522 --> 00:46:37.274
On your way into exile tomorrow,

00:46:37.858 --> 00:46:40.152
you'll be attacked by bandits.

00:46:40.235 --> 00:46:43.447
Pretend you're captured by them
and follow them. You'll save your life.

00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:45.407
I'll come for you when the time is right.

00:46:46.325 --> 00:46:47.701
I thought

00:46:47.784 --> 00:46:49.328
you'd abandoned me, Father.

00:46:50.662 --> 00:46:52.289
I would never.

00:47:04.635 --> 00:47:06.345
You have a long way to go.

00:47:06.928 --> 00:47:09.389
Eat this before you leave tomorrow.

00:47:12.517 --> 00:47:13.727
Father.

00:47:16.271 --> 00:47:17.898
Im Sa-hyeong spoke with Im Seung-jae

00:47:17.981 --> 00:47:20.025
for about a quarter of an hour
at the jail.

00:47:20.108 --> 00:47:22.694
Do you think
he will really get Im Seung-jae out?

00:47:23.904 --> 00:47:24.738
Most likely.

00:47:25.322 --> 00:47:27.407
No father would betray his blood ties.

00:47:27.491 --> 00:47:28.659
If that happens,

00:47:28.742 --> 00:47:31.536
we can charge Im Sa-hyeong
with supporting a traitor.

00:47:33.205 --> 00:47:34.873
The young viper was bait for the old one.

00:47:35.749 --> 00:47:36.625
That was your plan.

00:47:37.209 --> 00:47:38.585
Are you always this slow?

00:47:39.086 --> 00:47:40.504
What about the thing I asked for?

00:47:40.587 --> 00:47:42.130
Right. I have it prepared.

00:47:44.883 --> 00:47:47.302
But who are the military uniforms for?

00:47:49.513 --> 00:47:50.722
A special squad.

00:47:55.686 --> 00:47:57.437
We need in soldiers in disguise.

00:47:57.521 --> 00:47:59.690
If Aide Kang openly assembles soldiers,

00:47:59.773 --> 00:48:02.693
Lord Im Sa-Hyeong will find out.

00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:07.239
If this must be handled discreetly,
you've come to the right person.

00:48:07.322 --> 00:48:10.033
I used to beat some sense into the nobles.

00:48:10.617 --> 00:48:11.952
You and your bluff again.

00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:14.788
I'm serious. I was famous for it.

00:48:15.372 --> 00:48:16.581
Are you coming too?

00:48:16.665 --> 00:48:20.043
Yes, I'll be on standby nearby,
just in case.

00:48:20.627 --> 00:48:22.963
This is the only path
leading to the place of exile.

00:48:23.046 --> 00:48:25.173
Im Seung-jae will show up
in a couple of hours.

00:48:25.257 --> 00:48:27.384
I know it's tough, but let's be patient.

00:48:40.522 --> 00:48:41.356
Did you send for me?

00:48:42.774 --> 00:48:44.067
Release Jae-i.

00:48:44.651 --> 00:48:46.862
He needs to see his brother.

00:48:46.945 --> 00:48:48.196
Your Highness!

00:48:52.701 --> 00:48:53.535
Did they get him?

00:48:53.618 --> 00:48:55.912
- It didn't go as planned.
- What?

00:48:55.996 --> 00:48:57.205
He ordered us to release you.

00:48:57.289 --> 00:48:59.458
Go straight home. Don't stray.

00:49:01.835 --> 00:49:02.919
Why?

00:49:03.754 --> 00:49:05.130
Your brother

00:49:06.298 --> 00:49:07.299
has passed.

00:49:08.675 --> 00:49:09.509
It wasn't suicide.

00:49:10.177 --> 00:49:11.595
So he was murdered?

00:49:11.678 --> 00:49:14.389
He had eaten poisoned food before he left.

00:49:31.823 --> 00:49:34.159
And the person
who brought him the meal the day before

00:49:34.242 --> 00:49:36.203
was Im Sa-hyeong.

00:49:58.183 --> 00:49:59.810
I can't believe he killed his own son.

00:50:00.936 --> 00:50:02.604
Even animals don't do that.

00:50:05.023 --> 00:50:08.819
His Highness and I
misjudged Lord Im Sa-hyeong.

00:50:14.866 --> 00:50:16.409
Did you say

00:50:17.786 --> 00:50:20.330
you do not wish to hold a funeral for him?

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:23.583
A criminal's death

00:50:24.709 --> 00:50:26.545
is not to be mourned.

00:50:27.879 --> 00:50:28.964
Make sure

00:50:29.965 --> 00:50:33.468
no one outside the house hears any crying.

00:50:44.062 --> 00:50:45.730
This is the robe

00:50:45.814 --> 00:50:48.859
your brother treasured.

00:50:50.193 --> 00:50:51.444
Burn it.

00:51:06.626 --> 00:51:10.005
The body was buried secretly,
facing the family burial grounds.

00:51:28.732 --> 00:51:32.193
If I had saved him
with bandits in disguise,

00:51:32.277 --> 00:51:35.739
they would have accused me
of the same crime.

00:51:37.782 --> 00:51:39.492
This family would've been wiped out.

00:51:45.457 --> 00:51:47.876
He was dressed only in fine clothes

00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:50.879
and fed only fine food.

00:51:56.509 --> 00:51:59.512
Even if he had gone with the bandits
and lived in hiding,

00:52:01.514 --> 00:52:03.183
he wouldn't have even lasted two weeks.

00:52:03.266 --> 00:52:05.685
He couldn't have tolerated
their filth and baseness.

00:52:05.769 --> 00:52:07.437
And that would've been

00:52:08.063 --> 00:52:09.981
a dog's death.

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:14.527
He knew it was a disgrace

00:52:14.611 --> 00:52:16.071
to be beheaded,

00:52:16.863 --> 00:52:19.950
yet he lacked the resolve
to take his own life.

00:52:20.742 --> 00:52:21.868
So

00:52:22.869 --> 00:52:26.373
I needed to find a way
to at least keep his body.

00:52:27.958 --> 00:52:29.250
Is that what you believe?

00:52:31.169 --> 00:52:32.295
You're wrong.

00:52:32.796 --> 00:52:35.423
You could not bear the thought of your son

00:52:36.007 --> 00:52:38.760
returning from the bandits
in just two weeks,

00:52:38.843 --> 00:52:40.345
begging for his life.

00:52:40.929 --> 00:52:43.556
You sacrificed him
because you don't need him anymore.

00:52:46.726 --> 00:52:49.229
You really are like me, inside and out,

00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:51.690
unlike Seung-jae.

00:52:53.191 --> 00:52:54.567
It must be devastating for you

00:52:55.193 --> 00:52:56.945
that I'm the only one left.

00:52:58.196 --> 00:53:00.407
If you defy me,

00:53:01.908 --> 00:53:03.868
you will have to renounce
the name I gave you.

00:53:11.126 --> 00:53:12.335
I will have everything.

00:53:12.419 --> 00:53:14.462
If I renounce the name now,

00:53:14.546 --> 00:53:16.798
everything I've struggled for
will be for nothing.

00:53:34.482 --> 00:53:36.359
This is my order.

00:53:36.901 --> 00:53:38.361
Be my blade

00:53:39.654 --> 00:53:41.948
and slay Grand Prince Dowol.

00:54:09.434 --> 00:54:10.643
How did you…

00:54:12.937 --> 00:54:14.064
I climbed over the wall

00:54:15.231 --> 00:54:16.066
and opened the door.

00:54:18.276 --> 00:54:19.652
Have you been

00:54:19.736 --> 00:54:20.570
drinking?

00:54:23.656 --> 00:54:24.699
A lot.

00:54:25.658 --> 00:54:27.285
To the point that

00:54:27.368 --> 00:54:29.537
I won't even remember this tomorrow.

00:54:35.752 --> 00:54:36.711
Wait here.

00:54:37.295 --> 00:54:38.338
I'll bring some water.

00:54:44.886 --> 00:54:47.263
If I become his blade
and strike the Grand Prince,

00:54:48.681 --> 00:54:49.974
it must hurt you.

00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:54.145
But I hope it won't hurt you too much.

00:54:55.063 --> 00:54:57.023
I hope it won't hurt you too much.

00:54:57.107 --> 00:54:59.359
And I mean it.

00:55:01.236 --> 00:55:02.362
I…

00:55:03.696 --> 00:55:05.198
mean it too.

00:55:14.541 --> 00:55:16.167
Is he gone?

00:55:26.177 --> 00:55:27.512
I'm sorry about

00:55:28.221 --> 00:55:29.556
what happened to your brother.

00:55:30.932 --> 00:55:33.017
If you're here to declare a war,
do it properly.

00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:35.478
So I don't have any regrets.

00:55:35.562 --> 00:55:38.439
Your Highness and I
are no longer protecting the same thing.

00:55:42.402 --> 00:55:45.155
If you have decided to fight
for your father and your family,

00:55:45.697 --> 00:55:46.739
give it your all.

00:55:47.323 --> 00:55:50.577
I'll do everything I can
to destroy your family as well,

00:55:51.411 --> 00:55:54.330
for what I have always protected.

00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:04.090
Once you leave this place,

00:56:04.674 --> 00:56:06.384
you and I will be enemies.

00:56:08.178 --> 00:56:09.304
Agreed?

00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:11.931
Agreed.

00:56:31.034 --> 00:56:33.161
Find the assassin!

00:56:49.969 --> 00:56:52.013
Summon the State Tribunal at once!

00:56:56.392 --> 00:56:57.560
It's a royal order!

00:56:57.644 --> 00:56:59.938
Find anything
that could serve as evidence!

00:57:00.021 --> 00:57:01.314
Yes, sir!

00:57:03.524 --> 00:57:05.526
As if there is anything.

00:57:06.486 --> 00:57:09.447
Tell me again,
what exactly happened that night?

00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:12.033
So, His Majesty
was chasing the courtesans.

00:57:12.116 --> 00:57:14.035
Then an arrow almost struck him.

00:57:14.118 --> 00:57:16.663
It was from the assassin
on the cliff over there.

00:57:16.746 --> 00:57:18.081
Some of the soldiers saw him,

00:57:18.164 --> 00:57:20.166
and said he seemed just under nine cheok.

00:57:20.250 --> 00:57:21.501
That's almost as tall as you.

00:57:28.049 --> 00:57:28.967
Why is this here?

00:57:29.551 --> 00:57:31.719
Why? Because that's the assassin's arrow.

00:57:38.184 --> 00:57:39.310
I found it.

00:57:39.852 --> 00:57:40.853
Found what?

00:57:42.939 --> 00:57:43.940
The name of the assassin.

00:57:46.234 --> 00:57:47.360
It's Gil-dong.

00:57:50.363 --> 00:57:53.408
This is the list of the merchants
Im Sa-hyeong dealt with as a historian.

00:57:53.491 --> 00:57:55.827
We might find something here
to have him dismissed.

00:57:59.330 --> 00:58:00.498
Your Highness,

00:58:00.582 --> 00:58:02.000
please look at this.

00:58:03.001 --> 00:58:04.252
What is it?

00:58:04.335 --> 00:58:05.712
The sketch of Gil-dong's face.

00:58:07.088 --> 00:58:09.340
Gil-dong is the assassin
who shot His Majesty?

00:58:09.424 --> 00:58:11.259
This is posted everywhere

00:58:11.342 --> 00:58:12.677
in and around the capital.

00:58:20.268 --> 00:58:21.686
"It's a royal order."

00:58:22.437 --> 00:58:24.480
"Anyone who sees Gil-dong

00:58:24.564 --> 00:58:26.858
is to kill him

00:58:26.941 --> 00:58:27.942
on the spot."

00:58:29.986 --> 00:58:31.988
"Gil-dong is a man skilled in archery,

00:58:32.572 --> 00:58:34.282
nine cheok tall…

00:58:36.492 --> 00:58:38.661
"Nine cheok tall"?

00:58:49.881 --> 00:58:50.882
It's the Grand Prince.

00:58:51.716 --> 00:58:53.509
This is aimed at the Grand Prince.

00:59:03.019 --> 00:59:04.771
Do you know what you have done?

00:59:06.648 --> 00:59:08.232
Gil-dong

00:59:08.316 --> 00:59:11.361
is the very name
I'm fighting with my life to protect.

00:59:15.281 --> 00:59:16.741
You're of royal blood.

00:59:18.076 --> 00:59:20.119
Turn yourself in.
The worst you'll face is exile.

00:59:29.253 --> 00:59:30.672
What are you doing here?

00:59:39.597 --> 00:59:40.848
Arrest me.

00:59:40.932 --> 00:59:42.225
I am

00:59:42.809 --> 00:59:44.102
Gil-dong.

01:00:34.152 --> 01:00:35.486
{\an8}I didn't trust you.

01:00:35.570 --> 01:00:36.946
{\an8}I trusted Im Jae-i.

01:00:37.029 --> 01:00:38.489
{\an8}Stop the investigation.

01:00:38.573 --> 01:00:40.700
{\an8}You already found the evidence.

01:00:40.783 --> 01:00:41.868
{\an8}Gil-dong.

01:00:41.951 --> 01:00:42.994
{\an8}I will go.

01:00:43.077 --> 01:00:44.495
{\an8}Are you leaving right away?

01:00:44.579 --> 01:00:47.498
{\an8}If anything happens while I'm away,
stay low.

01:00:47.582 --> 01:00:48.875
{\an8}Search every corner!

01:00:48.958 --> 01:00:51.711
{\an8}The king's madness
is worse than in the Gyeongo Year.

01:00:51.794 --> 01:00:53.629
{\an8}You wouldn't even cry.

01:00:53.713 --> 01:00:56.424
{\an8}Bring all the troops into the capital.

01:00:56.507 --> 01:00:58.926
{\an8}I shall hunt Gil-dong!

01:00:59.010 --> 01:01:00.636
{\an8}There you are.

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:02.847
{\an8}You're the real Gil-dong.

01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:04.932
