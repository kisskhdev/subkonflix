(This story is purely fictional)

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.110
What a good yet mediocre game.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.670
What are you talking about, Mr. Pei?

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.750
I'm saying that this is a good game.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.190
Mr. Pei,

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.470
should we find some gaming streamers

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.020
for our marketing?

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.180
This time, we have sufficient budget.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.740
We must expand our marketing channels

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.649
to various industries

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.124
and work with all kinds of streamers.

00:02:15.124 --> 00:02:17.020
Don't be fixated on
just the gaming industry.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.550
For the gaming industry,

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.070
we just need Mr. Qiao.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.140
That fatso, Mr. Qiao,

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.140
who thrashed us for The Lonely Road?

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.140
He did

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.390
post a video to thrash us
for The Lonely Road,

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.140
but it actually

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.070
brought us a lot of attention.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.110
Besides, he promoted

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.620
Divine General Pact in his video.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.830
He helped Tengda a lot.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.390
We should repay him.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:42.390
All right.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.670
I'll go and approach him.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.070
Hello, Mr. Qiao.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.620
I am from Tengda Games.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.420
I am Huang Sibo.

00:02:56.155 --> 00:02:57.155
You're from Tengda?

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.860
Then, this is...

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:00.670
Mr. Qiao,

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.140
all of us watched

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.140
the previous videos

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.860
you posted about The Lonely Road

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:05.950
and Divine General Pact.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.110
These two games

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.550
were developed by our company.

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.990
You watched them all?

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.860
Well, I'm just a thrashing streamer.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.140
Thrashing is

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.670
a kind of work to me.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.213
Moreover, I think

00:03:18.235 --> 00:03:19.950
The Lonely Road is quite interesting.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.350
Also, I've not thrashed

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.390
Divine General Pact even once.

00:03:24.502 --> 00:03:26.830
I even gained many followers
because of these two videos.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.420
I should be the one thanking you.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.110
I...

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.140
Mr. Qiao, calm down.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.350
We are

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.950
very grateful to you

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.110
for giving Tengda Games your attention.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.140
So, Mr. Pei

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.140
wants to invite you
for a collaboration this time.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.350
This is

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.350
a new game
that we will be launching soon.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.420
Deserted Island Sharpshooter.
This is the script.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.550
I hope you can

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.830
post another video
to promote our game, Mr. Qiao.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.830
I usually make videos

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.390
out of passion.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:59.830
Let me take a look.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.550
It's like this.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.550
If the videos I made previously

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.260
affected your company negatively,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.820
I apologize to you.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.940
But isn't this too humiliating?

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.380
What kind of script is this?

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:26.820
Mr. Qiao,

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.180
don't be agitated.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.500
Calm down.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.820
You've misunderstood.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:31.550
Mr. Pei

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.620
is sincerely

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.813
inviting you to collaborate.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:36.860
Mr. Pei also asked me

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.740
to show you our sincerity.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.500
This amount.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.980
(Deserted Island Sharpshooter Script)

00:04:53.524 --> 00:04:55.420
I can memorize this script
in ten minutes.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.500
When do we start?

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.990
Anytime.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:00.500
Hello, everyone.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.740
Welcome to "What Happens

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.300
in the Gaming Industry?"

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.300
This morning at eight,

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.300
Fuhui Group's

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.413
famous local developer, Sky Fire,

00:05:07.435 --> 00:05:09.500
has officially launched
its new game, Bullet Mark,

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.990
which attracted a lot of attention.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.420
Bullet Mark

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.820
is an FPS game

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.060
with a special setting.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.500
(Bullet Mark)
Our goal is

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.420
to be better than 99%

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.420
of the industry's games
of a similar genre.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.420
We have made every battle

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.300
a unique experience.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.860
(Widespread marketing)

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.500
(has attracted the attention of gamers.)

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.820
(It has become a game
that is talked about most today.)

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:33.899
(Also, another FPS game)

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:34.849
(with a special setting,)

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.360
(Tengda chose to launch their game
on the same day as Sky Fire.)

00:05:37.368 --> 00:05:39.740
(They are probably trying
to leech off Bullet Mark's hype.)

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.180
(However, from the number of downloads
and reviews right now,)

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.860
(Deserted Island Sharpshooter
is actually in a dire situation.)

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.820
I don't know
what Mr. Pei is thinking about.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.013
The gaming content creator
he asked me to work with

00:05:51.013 --> 00:05:51.860
was only Mr. Qiao.

00:05:51.924 --> 00:05:53.813
The rest were
beauty and food content creators.

00:05:53.857 --> 00:05:54.880
Moreover, he paid Mr. Qiao

00:05:54.902 --> 00:05:56.150
a hefty sum for promotion.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.420
Since the script written by Mr. Pei

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.990
was too humiliating,

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.660
Mr. Qiao was scolded by his fans
and ended up closing his account.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:03.500
Look.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.860
(Mr. Qiao)
(What a beautiful starting screen.)

00:06:08.968 --> 00:06:10.110
(I believe this scene alone)

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.500
(is worth 3,000 yuan, at least.)

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.990
(It's really cool.)

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.860
(Okay.)

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.300
(I'll treat it)

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.300
(as a normal FPS game.)

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.110
(Is Mr. Qiao doing performance art?)
(I won't overglorify it)

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:23.740
(The most awesome FPS in history)
(and give it too much praise)

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.110
("Deserted Island Sharpshooter" so cool)
(but I really can't do it)

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.300
(because it's really cool.)

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.990
Mr. Pei is extraordinary.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:33.620
He's mentally tough.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.180
How did he come up with this script?

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.860
What is he actually trying to achieve?

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.300
Many people online are saying

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.860
that the game lags when they fire.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.180
I noticed it, too.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.180
Come and take a look.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.990
Every time you shoot, it lags.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:50.860
That's impossible.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.180
We tested it previously.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.620
This shouldn't happen.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.500
(Game Over)

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.110
What's wrong with it?

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.550
People will scold us.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.740
Good morning.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.740
Why do you all look so dejected
in the morning?

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:09.620
Mr. Pei,

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.990
Bullet Mark is going strong.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:14.990
Our marketing
hasn't helped push our sales.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:16.420
Our numbers are still low.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:17.260
For some reason,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.550
there are still bugs in the game.

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:20.620
It lags every time the gamer fires.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.180
There's a lot of negative feedback.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.620
However, it wasn't like this
before the game was launched.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.620
I know about everything.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.300
Give me a moment.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.180
I'm going back to my office.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:56.500
Wait... What?

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:09.550
Oh, no.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.300
It doesn't sound right.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.300
Will something happen to Mr. Pei?

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.300
Is he crying?

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.300
This is bad.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:23.550
We should leave first.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:24.620
I'm leaving.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:25.550
Let's go.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:28.420
What's going on?

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.110
Sorry, Mr. Pei.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.310
I've disappointed you this time.

I'm fine.

I just sent Ms. Xin

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:09.500
a message

all of you have worked very hard.

I'm planning a lunch gathering

go mad because of me?

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:41.380
I can never predict anything he does.

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:49.110
I'm lagging.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:50.380
What lousy game is this?

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.500
I'm also lagging.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:52.620
This is so laggy.

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:53.140
Me too.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.780
Same here.
What kind of lousy game is this?

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:55.740
Looks like presentation slides.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:56.830
I'm also lagging.

00:09:56.835 --> 00:09:58.140
What kind of lousy game
did Tengda just develop?

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.350
It's definitely the game.
I've lagged eight times.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.990
We should play Bullet Mark instead.

00:10:03.168 --> 00:10:04.110
Let's play Bullet Mark.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:05.230
It's fun.

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:37.260
Mr. Pei,

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.260
the bug

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:40.590
has a huge impact.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:42.380
It's all my fault.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.740
I'm the lead
for Deserted Island Sharpshooter.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.110
I didn't realize the bug.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.500
I take full responsibility.

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:50.260
Actually,

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.990
a bug like this

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.740
is very normal.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:54.900
It's not normal!

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.110
I'm sure someone sabotaged us.

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:56.990
When I find that jerk,

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.380
I'll kill him!

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:01.110
It's me.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.350
I need you to add a bug

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:05.870
in the most crucial aspect of the game.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.860
The sooner, the better.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.900
It's like this.

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:19.500
I called everyone here

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.140
to say something to you.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.620
The failure
of Deserted Island Sharpshooter

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:27.020
isn't your fault.

00:11:28.168 --> 00:11:29.380
I should take responsibility.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:32.500
It was I

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.500
who made the wrong decision.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.500
It was I

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.500
who acted on my own.

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:40.860
It was I

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.990
who made unreasonable requests.

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:45.110
I made everyone launch such a huge title

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:46.500
within a short period of time.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:47.620
It was also me

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.260
who disappointed
all of your hopes and hard work.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:53.740
I've let all of you down.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:57.140
Allow me

00:11:58.500 --> 00:11:59.260
to apologize

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.590
to all of you right now.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:01.110
Mr. Pei.

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:02.500
Mr. Pei, no.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.740
- It's my fault.
- My fault.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:04.500
It's my fault.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:05.620
My fault.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:10.380
I've decided

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:13.740
to allocate the bonus

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.990
as usual!

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:17.740
I will never let

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.900
all of you who have worked hard

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.110
be treated unfairly.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:25.470
I hope all of you enjoy every day

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:27.350
at Tengda.

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:28.860
Be happy.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:50.900
Why is it lagging again?

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.990
Bao,

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:56.110
do you know what time it is?

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.435
Why do you still have the mood
to play matching games?

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:00.900
When you are stressed,

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:02.710
playing mini games relieves your stress.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.740
Liang, I beg you.

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:06.500
Help me again.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.924
I don't want to give up
on Deserted Island Sharpshooter.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:10.620
Didn't Mr. Pei say it?

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:11.990
This matter is in the past.

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:13.780
We must look forward.

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:16.710
It's a strong front.

00:13:16.746 --> 00:13:18.260
He must be putting up a strong front.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.590
He asked us
not to care about this failure

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.620
but he must be upset about this.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:24.900
Look at his back.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.110
He looks so lonely.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.260
This time, I'll surely lose money.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:37.620
I think

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:39.740
he is really crying.

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:41.380
What did I say?

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:41.900
No.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:43.710
I remember he ate a lot

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:45.020
during the gathering yesterday.

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:48.860
It's my first time seeing him

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:49.860
eat so much.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:51.260
He didn't

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:52.500
seem sad.

00:13:52.546 --> 00:13:55.213
A truly strong person won't
be arrogant when things go right

00:13:55.235 --> 00:13:56.930
and won't be dejected
when things go wrong.

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:58.380
He didn't blame any of us for

00:13:58.380 --> 00:13:59.900
Deserted Island Sharpshooter's failure.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.710
He shouldered all the responsibility.

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:03.230
Indeed.

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:05.020
He is the only boss I've seen

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.480
who will apologize to his employees.

00:14:06.568 --> 00:14:07.380
Right?

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:08.350
That is why

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:09.990
I want to do something for him.

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.380
It's so quiet today.

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:16.020
What are they all doing?

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:26.380
It seems like they have come out

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:27.260
of the last failure.

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:32.620
See?

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:34.110
See?

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:36.020
He is forcing a smile to encourage us.

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.110
We mustn't let Mr. Pei down.

00:14:41.502 --> 00:14:43.299
But it's really difficult this time.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:45.524
There's nothing good
about Deserted Island Sharpshooter.

00:14:45.546 --> 00:14:46.380
It even has a bug.

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.613
The internet is full of bad feedback.
Even if we fix it,

00:14:48.635 --> 00:14:50.350
we won't be able to get more downloads.

00:14:50.857 --> 00:14:52.110
Is there a possibility...

00:14:52.191 --> 00:14:53.620
I'm talking about a possibility here.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:54.990
Can we fix this bug

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:56.380
in a short time

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:58.110
and make the game fun?

00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:59.500
Can product managers like you

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.020
be more professional?

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:01.990
What do you think?

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:04.620
Do you think it's the cyber era
where you can get anything you want?

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:06.759
This is a client-based game.
It requires a lot of work.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.013
Do you think we are
making this mini game you're playing?

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:19.900
Come here. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:20.990
I have an idea. Come here.

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:23.070
Actually,

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:24.380
I think we can do this.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.860
Can we...

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:27.380
This might work.

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:29.950
Is there a possibility...

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:31.990
I think it works.

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.740
Sure.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:43.990
Let's get to work.

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.990
Let's do it.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.140
Are you Mr. Pei?

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:15.620
I'm Manager Mei from Mingri Apartments,

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.020
who contacted you previously.

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:18.140
Please follow me.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.380
Please come in.

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:27.260
Lin Wan.

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:29.500
Your house is huge.

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:30.991
My father bought it many years ago.

00:16:30.991 --> 00:16:32.830
Since Mr. Pei
doesn't let us work overtime,

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:34.620
I'll have to trouble all of you
to do it here.

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:35.620
Trouble?

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.380
This is so luxurious.

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:38.110
Exactly.

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:39.740
Is this still called working overtime?

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:40.860
Time is of the essence.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.860
Let's get to work quickly.

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:47.860
Among Jinchuan's improved housing,

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:49.213
Mingri Apartments are the best.

00:16:49.368 --> 00:16:51.160
It has the best greenery
in the neighborhood

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.740
and all the nearby facilities
are already there.

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.702
You don't have to wait
until the city develops.

00:16:54.702 --> 00:16:56.035
However, it's a popular property.

00:16:56.035 --> 00:16:57.500
You must purchase it quickly.

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:00.620
Can we sign the contract today

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.860
for the unit
you were interested in previously?

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:04.500
Just a little longer.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.500
I can sign it immediately.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:13.650
♪The siren sang
from the shallows of the river♪

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:17.330
♪With a bit of charm♪

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:18.500
Mr. Pei,

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:19.740
how soon

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:21.150
can you sign the contract?

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:22.580
We've been dragging for so long.

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:24.990
This time, it'll be really soon.

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:34.990
Do you plan to pay in full
or get a loan?

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:37.670
I should still get a small loan.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:38.740
Sure.

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:40.500
There's a promotion for the first loan

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.362
for your first house.

00:17:41.363 --> 00:17:43.953
If you're going to buy it soon,

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.430
should I prepare the contract for you?

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:47.500
No problem.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:48.260
Sure.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.780
I'll prepare the contract for you soon.

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:03.540
Mr. Pei, congratulations on becoming

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.150
(Property Purchase Contract)
the owner of Mingri Apartments.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:21.460
(One Month Later)

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:24.660
(Deserted Island Sharpshooter)

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:31.580
- Mr. Pei.
- Mr. Pei.

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:32.580
Good morning.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:40.990
Hello, Mr. Pei.

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:49.630
(I thought I found some ragtag bunch)

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:52.780
(and let them
go on holidays and gatherings)

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.820
(so they couldn't make a real game.)

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:56.580
Mr. Pei.

(However, this group of people)

00:18:58.613 --> 00:19:00.502
(actually treats their work seriously.)

00:19:03.057 --> 00:19:05.324
(I have no choice
but to let their efforts go to waste)

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:08.500
- (so the company loses money.)
- Do you want some?

00:19:09.524 --> 00:19:11.230
(I still need to take responsibility.)

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.060
(This is the unsolvable conflict)

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.910
(between Tengda and me.)

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.780
The failure of the game is set in stone.

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:40.500
Everyone,

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.910
you should stop focusing on this.

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:50.340
I've let all of you down.

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:53.710
If there's a chance,
I'll surely make it up to everyone.

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:54.390
All right?

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:03.880
Congratulations, Mr. Pei!

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.340
Deserted Island Sharpshooter
made a complete comeback in sales.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:07.480
Feedback has turned good.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:10.910
If this goes on,
we will soon surpass Bullet Mark!

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:14.300
What's going on?

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:15.910
This is impossible.

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:16.910
It's very possible.

and I.

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:21.902
The three of us
found an outsourcing service

00:20:21.924 --> 00:20:22.990
to add a mini-battle game

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:25.020
when the game lags.

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:32.470
What outsourcing?

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:34.470
What mini battle game?

00:20:34.502 --> 00:20:36.540
When gamers are lagging
when they fire a weapon,

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:38.910
they must complete
a mini-game battle with their enemy.

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:40.780
The games include
Tile-matching, Match-3,

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:42.910
Snake, and Gomoku.

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:45.580
Winning the mini game
equals defeating their enemy.

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.740
Congratulations, Mr. Pei!

Mr. Pei!

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.230
I'm so happy!

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:05.820
Mr. Pei is stunned.

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:10.190

You can actually play Match-3 in an FPS.

Why doesn't it lag?

00:22:58.500 --> 00:22:59.740
I want it to lag.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.950
Can someone tell me

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:07.430
why you can find

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:09.430
a Tile-matching game in an FPS game?

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:13.580
Isn't this idea great?

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.430
When Sibo first thought of this idea,

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:17.430
we never expected

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:18.950
the gamers to like it so much.

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:20.740
Even Mr. Qiao's reputation improved.

His commentary is in the top 3
of the most nonsensical category.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:24.580
Right now, everyone on the internet

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:27.080
calls Deserted Island Sharpshooter
the most special battle game.

00:23:27.102 --> 00:23:28.580
Bao Xu gave me inspiration.

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:30.060
Lin Wan helped me.

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:31.168
She found many gaming experts

00:23:31.168 --> 00:23:32.950
to test the game out
and provide suggestions.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.080
After all, Mr. Pei,

00:23:34.257 --> 00:23:36.340
it was you
who gave me the greatest inspiration.

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:37.150
I...

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.150
How did I inspire you?

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:51.300
You told me

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:53.500
to think out of the box.

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:55.670
The important thing
isn't perfection but completion.

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:57.190
So, I came up with this method

00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:58.950
to complete the game.

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:00.710
(First Blood.)

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:02.946
Why didn't you inform me beforehand?

00:24:03.013 --> 00:24:04.580
When there's a problem with the project,

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.300
employees must come up with a solution

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:07.260
and show results.

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:08.740
(Double Kill.)

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:11.340
Before you show me the result next time,

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:13.150
can you show me the process first?

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:14.430
No.

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.190
Because an excellent employee

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:17.470
only produces results.

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:18.430
Because I, Sibo,

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:19.670
will never let you down.

just look closely.

to quit this game anyway.

I don't care what your intention is.

What a pity.

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:11.190
I told Hailu

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:14.300
that you've been doing well until now.

00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:16.820
We can increase
the ratio of Tengda's loss

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:18.500
and your bonus

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.300

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:21.150
Right?

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:25.950
Actually, besides games,

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:28.430
there are still many industries.

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:30.540
You can't do games well,

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:32.820
but it doesn't mean
you can't excel in other things.

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:36.230

who is choosing the industry.

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:39.150

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:40.580

as the company's profit.

Mr. Pei,
if you want to extend your contract,

00:27:31.613 --> 00:27:33.435
you should think about
how you can lose money.

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:35.950
I made a few games
but I can't even lose a single cent!

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:37.100
I didn't make a single cent!

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:39.910
My mental health
is extremely unhealthy now!

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:46.710
Mr. Sima is right.

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:49.710
Tengda needs to change.

00:27:49.768 --> 00:27:51.680
I'm going to get involved
in other industries

00:27:51.746 --> 00:27:52.740

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:11.670
Right?

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:13.340
Mr. Li Jr.

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:15.230
How can I not be anxious?

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:16.230
Think about it.

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:17.060
Sky Fire

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:18.990
is a representative of Fuhui Games.

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:21.470
Mr. Zhou,

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:24.060
you must be magnanimous.

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:26.710
Don't get angry so easily, right?

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:28.540
Pei Qian's action

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:30.300
has embarrassed Sky Fire.

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:31.910
Embarrassing Sky Fire

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:33.580
is equal to embarrassing Fuhui, right?

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:35.580
That's absurd!

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:37.780
Embarrassing us?

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:39.950
Tengda?

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:42.190
All right. I understand.

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:43.710
That's all. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:48.540
Tengda?

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:52.260
I've never heard about it.

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:03.190
Seriously, what will they do

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:05.150
without me around?

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.820
Opening an internet cafe?

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:19.746
This is an important step

00:31:19.746 --> 00:31:22.580
for Tengda to become a corporation
and deepen its industrial footprint.

00:31:22.813 --> 00:31:24.820
I've decided
to let you take full control of this.

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:26.020
Are you ready?

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:27.990
I am ready.

00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:30.150
But Qian,

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:32.430
you said you don't want me
to get involved in gaming

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:34.613
because you wanted
to give me an important position.

00:31:34.613 --> 00:31:36.835
Is that important position
the owner of an internet cafe?

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:41.580
This is not an internet cafe.

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:43.580
It's a gaming cafe.

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:45.990
It is a huge cafe

00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:48.060
that combines
an internet cafe, gaming experience,

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:50.020
hardware sales,
and entertainment viewing.

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:51.990
That's just the owner
of a larger internet cafe.

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:53.500
Ma Yang.

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:56.500
You still don't understand
the importance of this.

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:58.580
Tengda is deeply rooted
in the gaming industry

00:31:58.580 --> 00:31:59.820
but what are we lacking?

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:00.580
What?

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:03.260
We lack an outlet
to communicate with gamers.

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.502
So, this is the first step

00:32:09.568 --> 00:32:12.740
for Tengda to expand
our footprint in the gaming industry.

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:13.260
Yes.

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.060
It is also the first step

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.780
for Tengda to become
the leader of the industry.

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:19.190
Very good.

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:21.910
Ma Yang, I can only rely on you now.

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:23.260
With Tengda's three games

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:24.500
as your moneymaker,

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:27.020
I'll support you no matter what you do.

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:28.540
I only have one request.

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:32.060
Tengda must establish a gaming cafe
with a certain standard.

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:34.740
Okay.

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:06.500
Mr. Pei, this way.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:09.740
Mr. Pei, this is it.

00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:10.670
Take a look.

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:11.470
This place

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:13.020
is spacious and comfy.

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:14.591
Its area is 2,000 square meters.

00:33:14.591 --> 00:33:17.060
It's rectangular and has
natural light from the north and south.

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:18.209
Although the price is higher,

00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:20.650
purchasing it is still better
in terms of cost-performance ratio.

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:21.857
This place is very adaptable.

00:33:21.857 --> 00:33:23.339
It can be turned into any kind of space

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:24.540
according to your requirements.

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:26.702
Excuse me. May I ask
what this place was in the past?

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:29.060
Honestly speaking, Mr. Pei,

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:31.299
we haven't been able
to rent this place out for some time.

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:32.800
Then, it has been used as a warehouse.

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:36.190
This is...

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:38.119
Mr. Pei, let me introduce you.
This is Zhang Yuan.

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.880
I hired him
as the internet cafe manager.

00:33:39.924 --> 00:33:42.060
Not only is he a manager,
but he also has many skills.

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:43.500
Hello, Mr. Pei.

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:44.470
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:46.230
What were you doing in the past?

00:33:46.655 --> 00:33:48.975
My experience is a little complicated.

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:50.260
I mainly assemble computers.

00:33:52.435 --> 00:33:53.500
Are you sure you can do it?

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:54.950
It has been five hours.

00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:56.430
I can.

00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:57.670
It'll be done soon.

00:33:57.670 --> 00:33:58.260
Soon.

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:05.870
I was also a singer for a while.

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:07.580
One, two, three, go!

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:10.220
Outside the pavilion,
beside the old path.

00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:11.990
The grass and the sky combine as one.

00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:14.699
Happy birthday!

00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:16.560
Are you mad? Who told you
to blow out my candles?

00:34:16.568 --> 00:34:18.540
Wait! I'm here to enlighten the mood.

00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:21.990
I also worked as a bartender
to make some extra money.

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:33.270
Mr. Zhang is a multi-talented person.

00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:35.020
Mr. Ma, I've decided.

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:37.302
We will make a small bar for Mr Zhang

00:34:37.302 --> 00:34:38.790
so he can make cocktails.

00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:40.100
We'll also buy him a guitar

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:41.790
and make him the singer of the bar.

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:44.350
Now, he will no longer be
just the manager,

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:46.430
but also the bartender and the singer.

00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:48.060
We'll pay him three salaries.

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:48.580
Sure.

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:49.540
Three...

00:34:51.435 --> 00:34:54.191
Mr. Pei, I'm too excited.
I don't know what to say.

00:34:54.235 --> 00:34:55.060
It's fine.

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:56.790
Don't worry. I'll surely work well.

00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:59.390
What do you think
about this gaming cafe's address?

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:00.270
It's very good.

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:02.700
It's near the university city
and has a lot of traffic.

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:03.750
It is also spacious.

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:05.260
You can renovate it however you want.

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:07.750
Mr. Pei, I want to voice my opinion.

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:08.790
Go ahead.

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:11.750
This place
might be spacious and adaptable

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:13.660
but its area is too big.

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:16.310
If you want to save on rent,
you have to purchase it.

00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:18.270
Although it is close
to the university city,

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:19.768
it's also located in a remote place.

00:35:19.791 --> 00:35:20.750
Not much foot traffic.

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:21.580
Is that so?

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:26.020
Mr. Zhang is right.

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:27.950
We'll take it.

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:29.870
You've made your decision?

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:31.750
Mr. Pei,

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:34.750
are you buying or renting?

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:38.950
(A property is a company's asset.)

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:40.750
(If I sell it, I still get money back.)

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:42.140
(I won't lose enough money.)

00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:43.750
I should rent it.

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:45.790
Great. Renting is good.

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:47.540
Let me prepare the contract.

00:35:47.546 --> 00:35:48.750
You've made your decision?

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:49.790
Not considering it anymore?

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:53.020
Where else can I find a place
that's more expensive than here?

00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:54.390
Don't worry.

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:55.830
I've already planned

00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:57.060
what to do with this place.

00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:59.060
The gaming cafe
is just a part of our business.

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:00.191
We will have 50 computers.

00:36:00.235 --> 00:36:01.750
If we have more than 50 customers,

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:02.750
just ask them to line up.

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:04.790
We'll set the price at 20 yuan per hour.

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:05.830
Well? Isn't it reasonable?

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:06.830
That's unreasonable.

00:36:06.857 --> 00:36:08.660
Then, we'll have
a coffee area over here.

00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:09.910
C in the morning, A at night.

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:11.750
What's that?

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:13.750
We'll sell coffee in the morning
and alcohol at night.

00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:14.870
Mr. Pei, don't worry.

00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:16.580
I can handle
all the operations of a bar.

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:18.140
I can make cocktails.

00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:19.140
Great.

00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:20.180
For the coffee area,

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:22.390
I've decided to give customers
a simple meal service.

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:23.390
I'll hire a chef

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:24.620
who must be good at cooking.

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:25.430
Our price

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:27.540
will be 30% more expensive
than in other places.

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:29.790
Over here, we'll have some
bookshelves and buy more books

00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:31.580
so customers
can cultivate their character.

00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:32.140
That's right.

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:34.724
After providing you
with the guitar in the bar area,

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.790
you can sing for the customers
when you feel like it.

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:39.270
Of course.

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:40.390
Wonderful.

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:41.910
Mr. Pei, the contract is ready.

00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:45.580
Who is this?

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:46.790
When did he sit here?

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:48.229
He's a mysterious person around here.

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:50.480
He always hangs around this place
when he has nothing to do.

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:51.390
I'll ask him to leave.

00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:52.390
Be careful of your method.

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:53.140
Sure.

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:55.750
Why is he burning incense?

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:56.540
Sir, excuse me.

00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:58.870
This place has just been rented.

00:36:58.870 --> 00:37:00.220
So, please move.

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:01.750
You can't stay here anymore.

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:02.924
Let me carry this for you.

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:04.750
Pour-over coffee is also served

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:06.390
at the place opposite here.

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:07.950
Do you think...

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:11.310
On the left.

00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:13.220
No. Behind you.

00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:18.310
No! Behind you.

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:28.060
What kind of lousy game
did Zhou Muyan develop?

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:29.580
You can't even win

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:30.660
without paying.

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:32.830
How boring.

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:35.100
No wonder his game was surpassed.

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:38.060
(Zhou Muyan)

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:42.140
(You are dead)

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:44.060
Muyan,

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:45.830
I'm playing with your game.

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:46.790
It is...

00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:49.750
What did you say?

00:37:51.839 --> 00:37:54.270
Pei Qian is opening a gaming cafe
at Jinchuan University City?

00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:55.910
What do you mean?

00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:58.350
Isn't he trying to steal my business?

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:00.470
Sure.

00:38:00.924 --> 00:38:02.620
I'll head over and check it out later.

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:15.830
Is this the place?

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:18.350
That's right. This is the address.

00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:22.750
This location

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.100
is bad.

00:38:24.902 --> 00:38:26.270
Will someone visit this place?

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:29.700
Mister,

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:31.870
is an internet cafe opening here?

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:34.270
What is its name?

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:35.750
It's written here.

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:36.350
Mo.

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:37.270
Yu.

00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:38.310
Moyu?

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:40.700
Move that...

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:41.270
Mister,

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:42.270
do you know

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:43.830
what the style of this internet cafe is?

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:45.310
I'm not sure.

00:38:46.013 --> 00:38:48.220
I think it's called
C in the morning and A at night.

00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:49.910
C in the morning and A at night?

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:00.270
What are they installing?

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:07.470
Qian,

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:09.580
isn't M&Y Internet Cafe opening soon?

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:11.750
What do you think of this promotion?

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:14.430
I plan to charge half price
for surfing the internet

00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:15.950
for the first few days.

00:39:15.991 --> 00:39:17.660
Next, beverages will also be half price.

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:18.750
What do you think?

00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:20.580
No. Absolutely not.

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:21.870
This is a high-end internet cafe.

00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:23.220
We will never allow

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:24.830
any discounts.

00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:30.280
Why don't I give out flyers
to promote our place?

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:32.629
We don't even have
any Chinese characters at the door.

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:33.910
I'm afraid people will come here...

00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:35.430
That's way worse.

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:38.350
We must let customers
discover this place

00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:39.700
on their own. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:41.430
That's more surprising.

00:39:41.435 --> 00:39:42.613
There's a saying,

00:39:42.635 --> 00:39:44.750
"When you're good,
you're not afraid of being hidden."

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:45.870
Such a good environment.

00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:47.635
Do you think
there's no money to be earned?

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:50.620
We are too hidden.

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:52.270
This place.

00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:02.340
(Grand Opening)

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:05.060
(Congratulations on Your Opening)

00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:10.310

- Welcome to M&Y Internet Cafe!

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:18.350
It's really awkward.

00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:19.540
There's no one here.

00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:21.270
Why did we choose this place?

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:23.910
Mr. Pei has his own reasons.

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:26.950
I'm tired from standing.

00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:29.830
Seriously.

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:31.950
Someone is here.

00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:35.390
Mister, do you want to use the Internet?

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:37.350
What is the charge per hour?

00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:38.430
Mister,

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:39.620
it's 20 yuan per hour.

00:40:39.830 --> 00:40:42.020
I'm asking about the normal zone,
not a single room.

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:44.020
It is the normal zone.
We don't have rooms here.

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:45.350
It's so expensive.

00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:46.790
I'm poor. Goodbye.

00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:49.540
Mister, I'll give you free drinks!

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:53.750
What is this?

00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:55.568
Turning a warehouse
into an internet cafe?

00:40:55.591 --> 00:40:57.100
Ridiculous.

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:03.580
It's fine.

00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:04.540
Let's do it again.

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:05.870
Come on. Three, two, one.

00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:08.910
