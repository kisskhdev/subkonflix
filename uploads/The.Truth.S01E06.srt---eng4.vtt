00:01:15.563 --> 00:01:19.576
(Bowang)

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.300
Excuse me.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.539
Where is the table reserved by Miss Han?

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.339
Sir.

00:01:27.339 --> 00:01:28.060
Second floor.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.739
Thank you.

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:29.500
No problem.

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:37.739
Little Zhao.

00:01:43.339 --> 00:01:44.339
Where should I sit?

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:45.979
- Next to her.
- Next to him.

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:49.179
I'll sit there.

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:50.780
Next to Little Zhao.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.379
Off duty now, let's have a drink.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.060
No alcohol. I might get called in.

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:01.020
Alright.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.899
You guys are killjoys.

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:04.660
Then I'll drink by myself.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.459
Yu.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.660
One pot of spirit and two colas.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.420
- Okay.
- Spirit?

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.540
You're really something.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.260
I'll open it for you.

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:21.459
I'm not drinking.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.380
I'll have water.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.659
I'll have it.

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:26.980
I'll have it.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.659
Did you tell Little Qian

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:37.659
that you're pursuing me?

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:39.619
No.

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:40.619
What for?

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:43.820
You know I like Little Qian.

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:47.179
I know you like Little Qian.

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:49.459
But Little Qian doesn't like you.

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.260
You're single, and I'm single.

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:52.659
So I can pursue you.

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:54.140
Don't need his permission, but yours.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.339
I haven't agreed.

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:56.260
I know you haven't.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.380
That's why I'm pursuing you.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.659
Fine.

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:00.659
You're paying today.

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:01.899
No problem.

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:03.860
This place isn't cheap.

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:06.860
Officer, can your salary cover this?

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.020
Don't worry. I've got Qian here.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.619
She owns this place.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.059
I opened this place for him.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.659
Try this.

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:35.540
This.

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:36.820
This is way too much.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:38.659
Not at all.

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.939
You need nutrients. Eat more.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.659
All are your favorites.

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:44.980
Just this once.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.260
Don't do this again.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.540
Too much to finish.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.059
You eat too.

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:51.540
Got it.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.580
Next time, let's eat at my place.

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:55.540
Your place?

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:59.179
I opened a restaurant nearby.

00:03:59.179 --> 00:04:00.420
You know the ropes.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.980
Come try the food sometime.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.260
Why open a restaurant suddenly?

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:09.059
You cops are busy,

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:10.219
but you still need to eat.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.939
If you eat at my restaurant,

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:12.939
I won't charge you.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.740
Actually, I wanted

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.859
you to come eat often,

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:24.979
then we'd see each other more.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.580
Han Zhao, I've told you.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.500
It won't work.

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:33.580
Why not?

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.580
We're both single and available.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.140
And I've got this.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.539
I support you

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.180
to open a restaurant.

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:45.659
But if you say it's for me,

00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:47.659
I won't accept it.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.979
Got it.

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:52.459
Enough talk, just eat.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.180
Quit rambling.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.700
Eat this. Your favorite.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.820
You eat too.

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:03.899
If you say so,

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:05.859
I won't come again.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.979
Well...

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.180
There are plenty of fish in the sea.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.979
Why only love Little Qian?

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.899
You're not his type.

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:18.060
Do you know his type?

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.979
Of course, I do.

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:20.380
He likes long-haired,

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.459
gentle,

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:23.620
simple,

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.859
and delicate girls.

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:27.260
You're not that type.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.140
You told him about Chen Yumo?

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.899
This way.

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:45.820
Mr. Pang, you're here.
The room your booked is upstairs.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:46.419
This way.

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:47.020
Thank you.

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:49.779
Please, this way.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.459
What would you like to eat?

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:53.779
Salt-baked mackerel pike.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:54.500
Thank you.

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:05.219
Pretty woman?

00:06:06.859 --> 00:06:07.659
Do you know her?

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.859
Colleagues.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.140
Same department with us.

00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:14.620
I really underestimated
you police officers.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.620
Your spending level is quite high.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:18.899
I think Ziwu

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:20.219
is here for another blind date.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.260
Blind date?

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:24.700
That guy comes here often.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.219
He brings a different woman each time.

00:06:33.299 --> 00:06:34.260
I often

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.299
come to this place,

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.339
so I booked here.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.979
The environment is nice.

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:41.820
Take a look at the menu.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.099
If you don't like it here,

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:45.539
we can change another place.

00:06:45.859 --> 00:06:46.620
No need.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.099
Anything will do.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:49.539
Alright.

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:50.979
Let's eat first.

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:51.859
By the way,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.140
I booked a KTV room.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.060
After dinner, we can go sing songs.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:58.580
Mr. Pang.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.740
I need to explain something to you.

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:03.539
Actually, I'm not interested

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:05.979
in this blind date today.

00:07:06.339 --> 00:07:07.099
The reason I came

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:09.339
is that I didn't want
to embarrass Mr. Zhao.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.260
After today's meal,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.140
I think

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.899
we won't meet again.

00:07:14.459 --> 00:07:16.539
So let's split

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:18.099
the meal cost.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:22.620
It's okay.

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:25.140
Take a look at the menu and order food.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.380
I need to use the restroom.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.580
Sir, what would you like to order?

00:07:34.859 --> 00:07:35.419
It's okay.

00:07:35.419 --> 00:07:36.380
I'll go to the restroom.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.060
I'll take a leak.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.260
I'll go too.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:47.940
Wait,

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.459
you two don't go to the same restroom.

00:07:49.459 --> 00:07:50.072
Well...

00:07:50.899 --> 00:07:51.539
Hello.

00:07:53.219 --> 00:07:54.140
Having a blind date.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.539
(Restroom)
A police, over thirty.

00:07:58.859 --> 00:08:00.979
I don't know why my mom knew her.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:02.299
Hello.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:03.659
Hello.

00:08:05.539 --> 00:08:06.779
But honestly,

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:07.940
I probably won't

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.539
get much benefit from this woman.

00:08:10.299 --> 00:08:12.219
I did some digging before I came.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.500
With her level and position,

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:15.219
she can earn

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.260
ten thousand yuan at most per month.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:19.620
What's the use?

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:23.940
To put it harshly,

00:08:24.419 --> 00:08:25.820
if she were frontline,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.099
died in service,

00:08:27.099 --> 00:08:29.140
I could get a compensation
of hundreds of thousands.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:30.099
Really.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.939
Just a woman without feminine charm,
no fun at all.

00:08:37.144 --> 00:08:38.936
(Restroom)

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:44.779
Who did it?

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.220
Who beat me?

00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:48.500
Where are you?

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:51.500
Don't dare to admit it?

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.376
What happened?

00:08:52.376 --> 00:08:52.980
Where were you?

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:53.819
Who's in charge?

00:08:53.899 --> 00:08:54.539
Took so long.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.779
No one leaves
until I get an explanation.

00:08:57.539 --> 00:08:58.500
Who's in charge?

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:00.299
Call him over,

00:09:00.299 --> 00:09:01.659
or I'll call the police. Hurry up.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.620
Where's the person in charge?

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.460
Call him over. Who hit me?

00:09:11.659 --> 00:09:13.340
Get me the surveillance footage now.

00:09:13.699 --> 00:09:14.380
Hurry up.

00:09:22.939 --> 00:09:24.179
Is this your car?

00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:27.179
My friend's.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:31.340
Sorry for causing trouble.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.100
Thank your friend for me.

00:09:33.539 --> 00:09:34.659
It's okay.

00:09:42.419 --> 00:09:44.620
I've seen the girl who had dinner

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.380
with you today.

00:09:47.819 --> 00:09:48.620
Where?

00:09:49.779 --> 00:09:51.419
When you first came to the department.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.539
Right at the entrance.

00:09:54.419 --> 00:09:55.860
I remember it quite clearly.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.299
I remember she had

00:09:57.299 --> 00:09:59.740
a Japanese lunchbox wrapped in cloth

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:00.860
in her hand.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.899
We grew up together.

00:10:06.179 --> 00:10:08.299
I can tell that girl really likes you.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:10.059
Ziwu.

00:10:10.699 --> 00:10:12.179
We're just friends.

00:10:27.579 --> 00:10:29.419
I wish she thought the same way.

00:10:34.179 --> 00:10:35.460
I forgot to warn that scum

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:36.760
to stay away from my restaurant.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.140
After what you did,

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.460
he'd never dare come.

00:10:41.179 --> 00:10:42.380
I bet he won't even come near

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:43.220
the area.

00:10:43.299 --> 00:10:44.260
But anyway,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.699
you shouldn't have beaten him.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.899
Didn't you hear what Little Qian said?

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.299
He's trying to exploit women.

00:10:51.299 --> 00:10:52.220
Not a chance.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.740
And I turned off the cameras

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:55.460
near the restroom.

00:10:55.939 --> 00:10:57.100
Smart move!

00:10:57.179 --> 00:10:58.779
He has no idea who beat him.

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.620
You didn't see the face of Little Qian.

00:11:01.939 --> 00:11:03.100
If I hadn't hit him first,

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.340
he would've done it instead.

00:11:04.939 --> 00:11:05.740
Right.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:08.220
Has he been like this?

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.059
So violent?

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.500
Of course not!

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.699
Little Qian has always been

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:17.340
good at learning

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:19.260
and gentle.

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:21.899
He can cook

00:11:23.179 --> 00:11:24.260
and paint well.

00:11:24.539 --> 00:11:25.819
He was a track and field star.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:28.579
Total heartthrob!

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:30.740
Really?

00:11:32.539 --> 00:11:33.819
Cross my heart.

00:11:34.939 --> 00:11:35.899
Let me tell you.

00:11:35.899 --> 00:11:38.340
Many people
had crushes on him back then.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.419
(There was a long line of admirers!)

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:41.819
Little Qian.

00:11:41.819 --> 00:11:43.699
(If we were taking numbers,)

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.059
(I'd be first in line.)

00:11:45.059 --> 00:11:46.899
Little Qian, fight for it!

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.380
(But he only had eyes for Chen Yumo.)

00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:59.419
Because of Chen Yumo,

00:11:59.419 --> 00:12:01.460
he fell out with his parents

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:04.299
and went to police academy,

00:12:04.579 --> 00:12:05.860
becoming a police.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:07.980
The most dangerous kind,
criminal police.

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:10.179
After all these years,

00:12:10.539 --> 00:12:13.020
he'd chase any lead

00:12:14.299 --> 00:12:15.779
about Chen Yumo

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.659
until he confirmed it was false.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:18.899
It's been ten years.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.939
You know he doesn't like you.

00:12:22.579 --> 00:12:24.179
Doesn't that hurt you?

00:12:28.579 --> 00:12:30.620
It hurts, of course.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:34.220
But I'm willing to wait.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.500
I'm still young, right?

00:12:37.899 --> 00:12:39.100
For someone I love,

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:41.899
I'll take the chance.

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.059
I'll grab more drinks.

00:12:57.304 --> 00:12:58.360
One.

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:00.260
Already back?

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:03.860
What are you doing?

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.659
Little Zhao

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.460
rides motorcycles and runs a restaurant.

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.419
Where else could I find
such an amazing girl?

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:26.899
I've decided.

00:13:27.699 --> 00:13:29.220
I need to earn more money.

00:13:29.899 --> 00:13:31.620
One meal cost me half a month's salary.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:32.299
That won't do.

00:13:32.299 --> 00:13:33.220
Can't keep this up.

00:13:34.419 --> 00:13:35.579
Where are you going?

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.380
Are you sneaking off to see Little Zhao?

00:13:41.299 --> 00:13:42.779
Go on!

00:13:45.539 --> 00:13:47.299
I'll focus on earning money.

00:13:47.779 --> 00:13:49.340
Work hard. Earn big.

00:14:01.547 --> 00:14:03.896
(At the department or at home?)

00:14:04.012 --> 00:14:09.944
(Zhang Ziwu:
At the department or at home?)

00:15:17.539 --> 00:15:19.260
Ziwu.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:20.980
Lei.

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.699
Little Qian's parents
are overseas, right?

00:15:26.659 --> 00:15:28.140
I've never heard him call them

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:29.419
once in the dorm.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:31.620
What a distant family.

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:33.740
But he and Captain Leng...

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.620
Honestly, they're kind of similar.

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.220
Men of few words, workaholics,

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:40.340
avoid relationships.

00:15:41.179 --> 00:15:41.939
Talking to them

00:15:41.939 --> 00:15:43.419
is like pulling teeth sometimes.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.620
Can't figure out
what Little Zhao sees in him.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.020
He's handsome!

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:52.380
Little Zhao?

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.340
The girl from that restaurant?

00:15:58.059 --> 00:15:59.059
How do you know?

00:16:01.059 --> 00:16:03.020
She's really into Ye Qian.

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.179
Don't get your hopes up.

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:06.620
Something's going on.

00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:08.020
Hurry. Tell me!

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.100
What is there to tell?

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:11.500
Not promising?

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:12.899
Unrequited love.

00:16:14.179 --> 00:16:15.020
How tough.

00:16:19.595 --> 00:16:22.443
(Shancheng Community, North Gate)

00:16:32.619 --> 00:16:40.152
(Eternal Love)

00:16:58.091 --> 00:17:04.024
(China Railway High-speed)

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.020
I've booked the room.

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.339
I'll pick him up tomorrow noon.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.220
Okay. I'll transfer you the room fee
via WeChat this afternoon.

00:18:15.619 --> 00:18:16.420
No need.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:18.539
He hasn't finished his homework.

00:18:18.539 --> 00:18:20.180
It's in the bag.
Tell him to do it, okay?

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:21.940
Xiaoyu, be good, okay?

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:23.260
I will pick you up tomorrow noon.

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:23.819
Alright.

00:18:24.099 --> 00:18:24.819
I'm leaving.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:29.460
Where do you want to go?

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:31.059
Let's go eat.

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:32.440
What do you want to eat?

00:18:33.339 --> 00:18:34.260
Anything.

00:18:56.539 --> 00:18:57.260
Where's Master?

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:58.660
He took leave.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:00.180
He took leave?

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:02.059
Where did he go?

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:03.980
He went to Shanghai.

00:19:08.099 --> 00:19:09.940
Well, could you give this to him for me?

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:19.619
Thanks.

00:19:32.664 --> 00:19:35.480
(Theater Entrance)

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:39.980
Are you a child?

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:40.980
No.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:41.740
Is this fun?

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:42.859
Yes.

00:19:43.339 --> 00:19:44.299
Why are you alone?

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:45.619
Where's Little Qian?

00:19:45.619 --> 00:19:47.220
Something holds him up,
so he won't come.

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.220
Why didn't you tell me?

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:50.980
If I'd tell you, you wouldn't have come.

00:19:51.099 --> 00:19:51.619
Take it.

00:19:51.819 --> 00:19:52.500
What for?

00:19:52.619 --> 00:19:53.379
I'm leaving.

00:19:54.619 --> 00:19:55.660
Wait. You're already here.

00:19:55.779 --> 00:19:57.660
We can just watch it together.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.099
About that motorcycle case,
I've wanted to thank you.

00:20:00.099 --> 00:20:01.099
You thank me?

00:20:01.579 --> 00:20:03.500
Little Qian should be
the one thanking me.

00:20:03.539 --> 00:20:05.819
With our relationship,
it doesn't really matter.

00:20:05.819 --> 00:20:07.700
It took you a whole month
to recall that?

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.579
I've been remembering it.

00:20:09.579 --> 00:20:11.020
But my actions got hindered.

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:11.700
Look at my hand.

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:13.579
I'm like a fortune cat.

00:20:13.579 --> 00:20:14.740
I can barely manage to eat.

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:16.900
You can barely manage to eat.

00:20:17.059 --> 00:20:18.700
But you send me selfies every day.

00:20:18.819 --> 00:20:20.180
You fortune cat!

00:20:25.819 --> 00:20:27.379
You thank me by inviting me to a movie,

00:20:27.379 --> 00:20:28.900
and I bought the tickets?

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:31.099
After the movie,
I'll treat you to dinner.

00:20:31.099 --> 00:20:31.980
Not a big deal.

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.619
Relax. I'm shopping with my mom.

00:20:43.619 --> 00:20:44.579
I'll tell her now.

00:20:45.779 --> 00:20:47.700
Since when did I become your mom?

00:20:47.819 --> 00:20:49.500
Last time, you sent
Little Qian dumplings.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:50.059
I lied to him

00:20:50.059 --> 00:20:51.500
that my mom made them.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:54.779
And you told me he accepted them

00:20:54.779 --> 00:20:55.859
and really enjoyed them?

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:57.619
He did accept them and eat them.

00:20:57.619 --> 00:20:58.819
And he enjoyed them.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.299
Si Yuanlong.

00:21:01.299 --> 00:21:02.660
Can you stop telling lies?

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.180
Can I trust you to handle things?

00:21:04.339 --> 00:21:05.819
Yes! Of course.

00:21:05.819 --> 00:21:06.539
Absolutely.

00:21:08.339 --> 00:21:10.500
Are you wearing Little Qian's jacket?

00:21:11.859 --> 00:21:12.779
He gave them to me.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:13.500
How is it?

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:15.660
Do I look better than him wearing it?

00:21:16.568 --> 00:21:17.299
W-Well...

00:21:17.299 --> 00:21:18.260
Talk about that later.

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:18.980
Let's go watch it.

00:22:01.644 --> 00:22:06.680
(Have you seen Xiaoyu?)

00:22:07.224 --> 00:22:07.896
(Zhang Ziwu: Have you seen Xiaoyu?)

00:22:29.356 --> 00:22:31.896
(Leng Qiming: Just had a meal with him.
He's doing homework now.)

00:22:32.396 --> 00:22:34.648
(Zhang Ziwu: Have you seen Xiaoyu?)

00:22:34.648 --> 00:22:42.840
(Leng Qiming: Just had a meal with him.
He's doing homework now.)

00:22:42.924 --> 00:22:48.472
(Zhang Ziwu: Talk to him more.
Don't just stare at him.)

00:22:55.779 --> 00:22:57.020
Got a lot of homework?

00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:58.500
It's manageable.

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:02.379
I've been swamped lately.

00:23:02.936 --> 00:23:03.619
Well...

00:23:03.779 --> 00:23:04.339
I know.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:07.220
Call me if anything's wrong.

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:08.299
Nothing's wrong.

Now you want to leave me here
all by myself?

within Beicheng County's jurisdiction,

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:10.460
a homicide occurred.

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:13.339
The victim, Wang Xiaole,
lived in Apartment 402,

Building 10 of Shancheng Community,

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:17.660
got murdered in her home.

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:21.420
Beicheng CID requested assistance
from city police department.

00:26:21.579 --> 00:26:24.339
And after deliberation
by city police department leadership,

00:26:24.339 --> 00:26:27.700
our department and the forensic unit

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:28.859

Good. I'll brief everyone.

The victim is Wang Xiaole,

33 years old,

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:47.579

Her parents reported the case.

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:52.420
According to her dad,

00:26:52.539 --> 00:26:55.660
around 9 PM on the night of the murder,

00:26:55.779 --> 00:26:57.660
he sent her a message.

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.099
But he waited until the next morning

00:27:00.099 --> 00:27:01.139
and still got no reply.

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:02.660
So he and his wife got anxious

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:04.700
and went straight to her home.

looks pretty sharp today.

Okay.

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.688

Why are you wearing my jacket?

00:27:39.379 --> 00:27:41.059
You gave it to me.

00:27:41.059 --> 00:27:42.539
Why can't I wear my own jacket?

00:27:43.579 --> 00:27:44.664
When did I give it to you?

00:27:45.339 --> 00:27:46.420
That day we had hotpot.

00:27:58.539 --> 00:28:00.260
You threw such a nice jacket away?

Quit the nonsense.

00:28:04.299 --> 00:28:05.379

00:28:05.579 --> 00:28:06.579
not gave it to you.

You did throw it away.

00:28:07.619 --> 00:28:08.420
But I asked you

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.339
to give it to me if you didn't want it.

00:28:10.339 --> 00:28:11.500
I asked you several times.

00:28:12.779 --> 00:28:14.339
I thought you were joking.

00:28:14.779 --> 00:28:15.819
Joking?

00:28:16.099 --> 00:28:18.059
Why would I joke about a nice jacket?

00:28:19.579 --> 00:28:21.020
It just had some frays.

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:24.339
I fixed them and it's all good.
Throwing it away is such a waste. Look.

00:28:26.379 --> 00:28:26.980
Alright.

00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:29.020
Then don't wear it when I do.

00:28:30.619 --> 00:28:32.740
Fine. Tell me in advance,
I'll wear a different one.

00:28:32.819 --> 00:28:34.360

Look, over there.

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:01.619
It borders a wooded area.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:03.619
It's pitch black at night.

00:29:04.339 --> 00:29:05.980

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:06.900
reviewed all accessible

a suspicious person was spotted.

00:29:13.379 --> 00:29:14.900
However, his identity

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.579
remains unknown.

have been re-collected.

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:44.740
The entryway mat was taken
by Beicheng CID.

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.299
A total of five bloody footprints
were found

00:29:47.379 --> 00:29:49.779
on the entryway mat
and in the living room.

00:29:50.059 --> 00:29:52.660

Zhou.

00:30:44.099 --> 00:30:45.579
Based on bloodstain distribution,

00:30:45.579 --> 00:30:47.980
it's concentrated near the nightstand.

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:50.660
The blood spatter
shows a high-velocity pattern.

00:30:55.539 --> 00:30:57.059
This indicates a powerful impact.

00:30:57.059 --> 00:30:59.192
I assumed the suspect
is a young or middle-aged male.

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:16.940
Based on the stroke width,

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:19.579
it was likely written
using a blood-soaked finger.

00:31:19.859 --> 00:31:21.180
But no fingerprints were left.

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:45.900
The writing flows smoothly.

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:47.220
The strokes are steady.

00:31:47.819 --> 00:31:49.260
And it's in standard script.

00:31:50.779 --> 00:31:52.619
What kind of person

00:31:52.779 --> 00:31:54.500
writes like this?

00:31:56.099 --> 00:31:56.819
Composed

00:31:58.740 --> 00:31:59.379
and calm.

00:32:02.539 --> 00:32:04.139
Probably well-educated.

00:32:05.379 --> 00:32:07.539
After committing such extreme violence,

00:32:08.139 --> 00:32:10.980
he still had composure
to write on the wall.

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:14.660
I think he is someone meticulous

00:32:15.339 --> 00:32:16.379
and unflappable.

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:19.460
It was likely premeditated.

the suspect

grabbed the victim's head

00:36:15.659 --> 00:36:16.380
Look.

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:19.619
These seventeen wounds
are straight, sharp,

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:21.820
(Victim's wound details)
and uniform in length.

00:36:22.579 --> 00:36:24.579
This requires the suspect

00:36:24.579 --> 00:36:26.579
to possess precise control.

00:36:27.099 --> 00:36:28.099
Moreover, I noticed

00:36:28.579 --> 00:36:30.659
during the cutting,

00:36:30.659 --> 00:36:32.300
a downward pressure was applied.

00:36:32.619 --> 00:36:35.020
This motion matches
a scalpel user's technique.

00:36:36.099 --> 00:36:37.739
No fingerprints were found on scene.

00:36:38.139 --> 00:36:40.536
The killer wore gloves

00:36:40.536 --> 00:36:42.380
both during the murder
and writing on the wall.

00:36:42.668 --> 00:36:43.500
(Blood writing on the crime scene wall)

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:45.579
I compared common types

00:36:45.579 --> 00:36:48.020
like cotton, synthetic fiber,
cloth, leather,

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:49.179
and latex gloves.

00:36:49.539 --> 00:36:52.420
Only non-absorbent types
can be dipped in blood for writing.

00:36:52.619 --> 00:36:53.380
After elimination,

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:55.860
only leather and latex
remain possibilities.

00:36:56.259 --> 00:36:58.020
Leather gloves

00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:00.619
are typically bulkier than fingers.

00:37:01.139 --> 00:37:02.460
When I tried writing in them,

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:03.900
caused by the finger squeezing,

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:05.980
the writing shows breaks or distortions.

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:08.659
Difficult to write words with
uniform strokes on the wall,

00:37:08.659 --> 00:37:11.096
let alone the fluidity of the writing
on the crime scene wall.

00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:12.280
Leather gloves out.

00:37:12.619 --> 00:37:13.780
As for the last possibility,

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:16.059
latex gloves are characterized
by high elasticity,

00:37:16.059 --> 00:37:17.219
smooth surface,

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:20.699
and fit closest
to the size of human fingers.

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:24.300
I bought commonly available
latex gloves on the market.

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:27.020
(Blood writing on the crime scene wall)
After testing with blood,

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:28.380
I preliminarily assumed the killer

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:29.940
wore medical latex gloves.

00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:32.059
These gloves have talcum powder on them,

00:37:32.619 --> 00:37:34.020
which has

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:36.460
a certain adhesive effect on the blood.

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:38.259
This can result in dripping blood trails

00:37:38.259 --> 00:37:39.860
(Wretch)
forming below the writing.

00:37:39.883 --> 00:37:41.380
(Suspect's shoe printings
left on the crime scene floor)

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:42.300
Around the hallway,

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:44.699
on the entryway mat
and inside the crime scene,

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:47.420
a total of five footprints
were collected.

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:49.500
All are of size 43,

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:51.099
mold-soled sneakers.

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:53.500
The tread pattern shows minimal wear,

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:55.500
indicating the shoes
might be relatively new.

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.619
However, because this type of product

00:37:57.619 --> 00:37:59.739
is extremely common on the market,

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:01.139
it has little reference value.

00:38:01.739 --> 00:38:04.059
Due to the small number
of footprints collected

00:38:04.059 --> 00:38:05.099
and their discontinuity,

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:07.780
we can currently only roughly
infer that the suspect is

00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:09.579
(Suspect's shoe printings)
a male of medium build.

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:11.739
We cannot infer

00:38:11.739 --> 00:38:13.659
more specific physical characteristics.

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:17.099
The Shancheng Community

00:38:17.099 --> 00:38:19.020
has cameras only at the main gates

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:21.139
on the north and south sides
for vehicle access.

00:38:21.659 --> 00:38:23.500
Those at the side gates
on the east and west,

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:26.139
and between buildings,
are just for show,

00:38:26.139 --> 00:38:26.900
not even powered.

00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:30.179
Colleagues from Beicheng

00:38:30.619 --> 00:38:34.020
had conducted
a preliminary review of the footage.

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:36.739
(Suspicious individual entering/exiting)
The time of this individual

00:38:37.259 --> 00:38:39.500
entering and exiting
through the south gate

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:40.940
matches the time of the crime.

00:38:42.099 --> 00:38:43.059
Thus, Beicheng CID

00:38:43.059 --> 00:38:44.980
identified this person
as the prime suspect.

00:38:45.035 --> 00:38:45.720
(Victim's ex-husband entering/exiting)

00:38:45.816 --> 00:38:46.460
Okay.

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:48.099
From this image, we can see

00:38:48.099 --> 00:38:50.380
he's wearing exactly a pair of

00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:52.300
mold-soled sneakers.

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:53.300
(Victim's ex-husband entering/exiting)

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:55.699
This person is the victim's
ex-husband, Wu Da.

00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:57.500
Captain Sun's team has confirmed

00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:00.099
that Wang Xiaole's boyfriend,
Huang Chong,

00:39:00.099 --> 00:39:01.940
was working overtime at the company
that night.

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:03.940
His colleagues can attest to this.

00:39:04.699 --> 00:39:06.460
Wang Xiaole's parents also stated

00:39:06.699 --> 00:39:08.420
that the two had a good relationship.

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:10.420
Moreover, both are
in their second marriage,

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:11.739
with no financial conflicts.

00:39:12.259 --> 00:39:15.820
However,
Wang Xiaole's ex-husband, Wu Da,

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:18.420
was seen entering and exiting
the Shancheng Community

00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:20.216
at 9 PM and 10 PM
on the night of the crime.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:22.579
Wu Da's semen was indeed
found inside the victim.

00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:25.579
But there's no evidence
of forced sexual activity at the scene.

00:39:26.259 --> 00:39:27.619
All evidence suggests

00:39:27.619 --> 00:39:29.659
the sexual encounter was consensual.

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:31.739
They were divorced,

00:39:31.739 --> 00:39:33.259
yet they maintained that relationship.

00:39:33.259 --> 00:39:34.739
We need to look into it.

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:09.940
Wu Da,

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:12.460
we're here today

00:40:13.259 --> 00:40:14.259
to learn more

00:40:14.259 --> 00:40:15.420
about Wang Xiaole.

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:23.259
Where did you injure your hand?

00:40:25.179 --> 00:40:26.099
I forgot.

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:28.780
Probably bumped into something.

00:40:35.115 --> 00:40:36.760
(Admission Letter)

00:40:37.099 --> 00:40:38.008
(Surgery, Surgical Nursing)

00:40:38.028 --> 00:40:39.000
(Vascular Surgery, Dermatologic Surgery)

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:39.896
(Clinical Oncology)

00:40:40.619 --> 00:40:42.179
How did he get so drunk?

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:45.659
He was also like this
during your previous questioning?

00:40:47.579 --> 00:40:48.259
Yes.

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:50.059
He was like this.

00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:52.659
(Surgery, Surgical Nursing)
It's said that ever since the divorce,

00:40:52.659 --> 00:40:53.900
(Vascular Surgery)
he's been drowning his sorrows in drink.

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:56.219
(Clinical Oncology)
He seems unable to accept this reality.

00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:57.500
Do you know Wang Xiaole?

00:41:01.099 --> 00:41:01.860
My wife...

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:03.860
Ex-wife.

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:08.059
What were you doing
from 12 AM on the 9th

00:41:08.619 --> 00:41:09.579
to 1 AM on the 10th?

00:41:10.619 --> 00:41:11.259
Drinking.

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:13.460
Where were you drinking?

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:14.739
Specific location.

00:41:18.579 --> 00:41:21.460
The flower bed at the north gate
of Shancheng Community.

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:22.980
Can anyone verify that?

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:25.539
Verify?

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:27.300
Verify what?

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:29.860
What exactly happened, Officer?

00:41:31.579 --> 00:41:33.940
You went to Wang Xiaole's place
last night, didn't you?

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:36.420
Why did you go there?

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:40.699
I just... We...

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:43.219
I went to get...

00:41:44.619 --> 00:41:46.539
Wait, officer.
I'm feeling really unwell.

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:48.539
Can you just tell me what's wrong?

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:56.619
Here.

00:42:07.739 --> 00:42:08.380
Xiaole?
