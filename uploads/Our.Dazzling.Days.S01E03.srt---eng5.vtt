[Our Dazzling Days]

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.660
[Episode 3]

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.560
What are you looking at?

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.840
Why are you sitting in my seat?

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.700
Ms. Tong asked us to switch seats.

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:53.430
Why?

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.930
She wants me to be your insulator.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.850
Be what?

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.390
Ms. Tong told me to be your insulator.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:09.410
Be quiet.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.280
Can you focus on your studies?

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.250
You're back?

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.360
Xia Lei, come out for dinner.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.570
Didn't you promise
you wouldn't tell the teacher?

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:32.190
You promised.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.910
Why did you go back on your word?

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.030
I didn't tell your teacher

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.400
about the relationship between you two.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.020
I just reminded her

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.700
not to let anything develop between you.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.300
Now my seat has been changed.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.960
Hurry up. We're waiting for you.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.710
Dinner's ready.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:48.570
I'm not eating!

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.310
Come out and eat now!

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.520
I'm on a hunger strike!

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.150
Hunger strike?
Like that's something to be proud of?

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.430
Let me tell you something, Xia Lei.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.430
If you start dating someone

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.400
and it affects your studies,

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.030
I'll jump off a building!

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.690
Then you and your father
can live by yourselves!

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.260
What's wrong, honey?

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:04.590
He just won't listen!

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.400
If you do that,

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.560
what will I do?

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.150
We can't punish adults

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.250
for a child's mistake.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.110
Hunger strike!

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.710
I'm innocent!

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.450
I'll take you both with me when I jump.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.450
Then I'd rather stay with the kid.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.880
Get out of here.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.120
Honey, where are you going?

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.140
Honey, how could you slam the door?

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.910
Honey!

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.710
Come out!

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.360
I'm kicking the door down, honey!

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.420
What are you doing?

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.520
Are you coming out or not?

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.800
It almost bumped into me!

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.710
Are you crazy?

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.400
Stop it!

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.880
Stop messing around!

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.360
You spoiled him!

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.290
Stop hitting me!

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:47.840
Lei! Lei! Come out quickly!

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.470
-Come out and save me!
-You spoiled him!

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.030
You spoiled him!

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.630
Come save your dad, Lei!

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.130
Why are they fighting?

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.170
Let me tell you.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.400
My mom's been
getting more and more ridiculous lately.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.000
She went to school and told Ms. Tong

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.240
that I'm dating Meng Ge.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.640
Now the whole class thinks we're together.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.520
Wait. When did you start dating?

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.050
What's that supposed to mean?

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.110
You're not dating?

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.870
I was actually
gonna ask you about it recently.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.520
I noticed you and Meng Ge
are always together,

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.680
acting all cozy…

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:13.940
Do you like her?

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.870
I'll push you off the second floor!

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.360
Stop! I'll fall!

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.560
How dare you grab me! Just wait!

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.560
Getting rough with me, huh?

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.390
-Get away!
-Are you getting rough with me?

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.600
Harder!

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.430
Getting physical, are you?

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.950
Is Xiaoman here?

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.120
Ma'am!

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.000
Come open the door for me.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.530
Come on.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:34.630
Ma'am.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.510
Freshly cut seaweed strips.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.630
Look at this kid.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.120
Coming through the window again.
Use the door.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.120
It's convenient.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.440
What's going on?

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.440
Using the door means I have to
take the stairs, ma'am.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.360
Xiaoman,

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.190
your knife skills are impressive!

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.720
It's a waste
that you don't sell mixed dishes.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.510
-Look at this knife skill.
-Right?

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.560
My knife skill has always been like this—

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.070
never declined at all.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.430
Don't chat with them.
Let's go out and have some fun.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.430
We're eating at home today.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.720
Come home for dinner later.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.580
Did you hear me?

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.730
Um, ma'am, we won't be eating at home.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.920
No way.

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:00.120
Dinner is already prepared.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.950
If you two don't eat,

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.550
you're not allowed to go out.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.800
Right.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.430
You can't go out without eating, Xia Lei.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.430
-You're not hungry?
-Hurry up.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.430
Not hungry at all?

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.920
-You two…
-Ma'am, he's not hungry.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:08.720
But he still needs to eat.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.750
You were so obedient when you were little.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:10.270
And now,

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.930
you all have minds of your own.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.360
No one leaves without eating!

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.160
Do you hear me?

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.020
Go, go, go.

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:20.020
Hurry up.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.950
They're gone.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:23.800
What's with these kids?

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.930
They've gone quiet.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.680
Come on, let's eat.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.560
Hurry!

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.750
It's raining!

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.480
Let's go play over there.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.310
It's actually raining.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.840
Let's go.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:38.600
Alright.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.830
Don't look so miserable.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.040
Look at you.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.040
You just changed seats.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.370
But those who don't know

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.159
might think Meng Ge went back to Beijing.

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:48.480
Will you ever stop?

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:50.560
I've already told my mom

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.430
not to go to school

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.360
and tell Ms. Tong about this.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.190
And now,

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.120
the whole class thinks I like Meng Ge.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.390
How can I not be angry about that?

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:57.120
So what?

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.430
You want to like her secretly?

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.630
Wh-What are you talking about?

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.230
What do you mean "secretly"?

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.050
I know what you mean.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.380
Your mom promised not to do this,

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.320
but she went back on her word.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:12.290
And then,

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.750
she went to school

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.960
and told the teacher about it,

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.780
causing the teacher and the whole class

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.890
to think you like Meng Ge.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.260
That's why you're upset.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.670
Right.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.790
But...

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:28.880
With your attitude toward your mom—

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.140
forget about your mom,

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.850
if you acted like this with me,

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.570
I'd think something was up too.

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.690
So I should have calmly told my mom,

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.600
"Mom, it's not what you think.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.000
I just borrowed
Meng Ge's poetry collection

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.750
and copied some of it.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:41.950
I think her poetry is good.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.190
That's why I copied it.

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.310
It's not what you imagine.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:45.720
I don't like Meng Ge,

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.000
and Meng Ge doesn't like me either."

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.320
I should have just
calmly explained it to her, right?

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.730
Exactly. See? You got worked up again.

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:51.590
Just talk things through calmly.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.480
Right?

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.159
Young love like this

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:56.760
often starts with sharing poetry,
doesn't it?

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:58.670
Besides, after all these years,

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.870
don't you know your mom's personality?

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.270
What kind of person is your mom?

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.720
Anything that might
affect her son's studies

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.600
gets completely eliminated.

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.350
Right? Not even a sprout can remain.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.490
Understand now?

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.820
I understand.

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:17.540
[Teaching Building]

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.680
I saw a poem at Meng Ge's place yesterday,

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.240
and I thought it was pretty good.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.390
What took you so long?

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:37.190
You're here pretty early.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:38.850
You're quite early, Xiaoman.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.240
Well, I copied it down.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.190
-Take a look. This one.
-Go ahead.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:42.190
"To the Oak Tree."

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.240
This one is great!

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.430
Why didn't I think of this?

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.920
Right?

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:48.120
But I'm worried
the teacher
might think it's not appropriate.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.430
Because it's all about romance.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.270
I don't think so.

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.510
Isn't this promoting women's independence?

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:55.890
Men and women on equal footing.

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:57.270
Neither is subordinate to the other.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.830
Right?

00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.030
That's good.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.360
Yesterday I divided it up.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.460
Look, I'll read this part,

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:04.900
and this part is yours.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:06.720
Mine, yours.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.020
And then together.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.270
How does that sound?

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:09.760
Not bad.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.800
Shall we give it a try?

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:15.220
If I love you,

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.630
I will never be a lovesick bird,

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.790
repeating
the same dull song for your shade.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.830
Nor will I be a spring,

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:27.530
offering cool comfort year after year.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:33.490
If I love you,

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.120
I will never be

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:38.809
a trumpet vine,

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.820
clinging to your lofty branches
to show myself off.

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:44.510
If I love you,

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:46.090
I will never be...

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:51.080
I will never be a lovesick bird,

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:55.580
repeating
the same dull song for your shade.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.660
Nor will I be a mountain,

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.400
heightening your stature

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:03.600
and dignity.

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:05.080
Not sunlight.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.000
Not spring rain.

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.030
No, these are not enough.

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:13.550
I must be a kapok tree,
standing beside you.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:15.790
As trees...

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.840
We stand together.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.730
Our roots tightly intertwined underground,

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.510
and our leaves touching in the clouds.

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:33.790
You're here.

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:34.080
How did it go?

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.210
Where have you been?

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.030
I went to help my grandma close her stall.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:39.460
Xia Lei said you memorized it all.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:41.610
Of course I can remember
those couple of lines.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:42.730
Come on. Let's go.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:43.600
I told you.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.600
He came prepared.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.150
If I love you,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.490
I will never be a lovesick bird,

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:54.070
repeating
the same dull song for your shade.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:45.790
What are you doing?

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:47.200
You're gasping for air.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.870
I'm fine.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.210
We all have to wait for him.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:55.160
Go ahead and eat.
It'll be wasted if you don't.

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:57.520
Xiaoman.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.790
-Why isn't Wang Dongdong here yet?
-Xiaoman?

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:00.500
Xiaoman!

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:01.610
Zhang Xiaoman!

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:02.600
Xiaoman!

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.390
Hurry up. Ms. Dai is looking for you.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:06.970
Ms. Dai is looking for you!

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:07.570
What for?

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.300
Come on. It's urgent.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:10.910
I just saved a seat.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:11.440
Hurry up!

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:12.640
Keep the seat for me.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:15.930
-What is it?
-Let's go.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:16.870
I don't know.

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:18.340
The show will start soon.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.390
She's inside.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:23.120
Ms. Dai.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:24.150
What's wrong?

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:25.550
"You have your copper branches
and iron trunk."

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:26.750
What's the next line?

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.680
"Like a knife, a sword, or a halberd."

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:31.680
Wh-What's wrong?

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.200
Ms. Dai, see?

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.870
I told you he memorized it.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.360
When we were practicing,

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:37.670
he was right there beside us.

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:38.960
What happened to your voice?

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.350
Xia Lei lost his voice.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:43.570
I gave him some licorice tablets,
but they didn't work.

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:44.690
Zhang Xiaoman,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.860
can you step up in this emergency?

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:48.080
Me?

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:50.960
I haven't even practiced this.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.110
Wait, I...

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:53.910
It's up to you now.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.210
It's starting soon.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.150
Where's Xia Lei?

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:02.690
Don't be nervous.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:03.880
Want some water?

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.150
Xia Lei...

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:08.790
I think I just saw him.

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:10.290
He should be here soon.

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:12.200
Isn't he usually reliable?

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:18.540
Here he comes.

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:45.870
Is there time to try again?

00:12:58.510 --> 00:12:59.040
Yes.

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:00.270
Yes?

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.030
If I love you,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.870
I will never be a trumpet vine,

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.460
clinging to your lofty branches
to show myself off.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.030
If I love you,

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:37.690
I will never be a lovesick bird,

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:41.290
repeating
the same dull song for your shade.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.360
Nor will I be a spring,

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.240
offering cool comfort year after year.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.840
Nor will I be a mountain,

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:52.730
heightening your stature

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.550
and dignity.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.550
Not sunlight.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.510
Not spring rain.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:01.460
No,

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.670
these are not enough.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:13.100
I must be a kapok tree,
standing beside you.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:17.630
As trees, we stand together.

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.510
Our roots tightly intertwined underground,

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.630
and our leaves touching in the clouds.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.650
With every passing breeze,

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:31.490
we greet each other.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:35.490
But no one understands our language.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.790
You have your copper branches
and iron trunk.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:45.360
Like a knife, a sword, or a halberd.

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.160
I have my crimson, full-blown flowers,

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:50.390
like heavy sighs,

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:53.080
and like brave torches.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:57.630
We share the cold waves, the wind,
the thunder, and the lightning.

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:02.930
We share the mist,
the drifting clouds, and the rainbow.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.630
As if forever apart,

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.120
yet bound together for life.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.360
This is true, great love.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:14.190
Faithfulness resides here.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.870
Love, not only for your towering form,

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.830
but also for the place you stand firm

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:24.360
and the ground you hold beneath you.

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:35.370
Bravo!

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.840
Dongfang Affiliated Middle School

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.080
Arts Performance...

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.080
That's not you.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:41.960
No, this isn't.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:42.890
This is the host.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.320
I haven't been on the stage yet.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.750
They're announcing me.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:48.040
I can only come on after they finish.

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.910
You'll show up soon?

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:49.910
Yes, soon.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.600
I'm behind the curtain now.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.720
By our talented student Zhang Xiaoman.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:55.800
Did you hear that?

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:56.310
I heard that.

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:57.150
Did you hear that?

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:58.010
Zhang Xiaoman.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.320
I heard that.

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:00.120
I heard that.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.120
-Then they went back.
-If I love you,

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:04.240
I will never be a trumpet vine,

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:07.410
clinging to your lofty branches
to show myself off.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.750
Isn't this the poem you always copy?

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.880
Why didn't you go up there and perform?

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.490
Why so many questions?

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:14.150
Just watch.

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:16.280
The show is pretty good, right?

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:19.960
Among all these performances,

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.550
my grandson's is the best.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:22.510
Of course.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:23.550
Absolutely.

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:24.550
It's just that...

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.210
I can't see clearly.

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.160
The people on TV are too small.

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:32.150
Well...

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:33.720
It's okay.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.480
This was my first time on stage.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.210
I'll be on stage more often later.

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:39.410
Next time you'll go sit in the first row.

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:40.150
Really?

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:41.150
That's great.

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:41.910
You'll watch from the first row.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:42.430
Good.

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:53.560
Cool!

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.080
Awesome!

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.570
Keep it down. I'm sleeping.

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:00.880
Aaron Kwok's hairstyle is so cool.

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:03.670
What?

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.130
That's the difference between us.

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:06.670
Lei.

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:09.480
Who's more handsome, me or Xiaoman?

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.829
Xiaoman, of course.

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:15.339
See? By conventional standards,
you're handsome.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.290
But this creates a problem.

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:19.030
If you don't change,

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:21.230
you can only be handsome,

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:23.550
but never cool for your entire life.

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:25.000
What does being handsome mean?

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.349
It means
you meet others' expectations of you.

00:17:27.349 --> 00:17:28.240
But being cool

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.530
means breaking
others' expectations of you.

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:34.320
Isn't that just being ugly?

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.710
How is that ugly?

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:37.790
Being ugly is when people see you once

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:39.520
and don't want to see you again.

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:42.030
Lei, since I got here,

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:43.900
you've looked at me 3 times.

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.780
That's called being cool.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:55.310
So... why can't we be cool?

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:56.740
Because you look

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.720
exactly the way people expect you to.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.830
All guys have buzz cuts, right?

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.030
After you get your haircut,
you look better than others.

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:03.960
That's enough.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.240
Our plant's next anniversary celebration
is about to start.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.440
All eyes will be on it.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.180
We need to become cool.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.200
You've got this?

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:21.590
1,500.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:22.440
How much?

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:23.720
1,500.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.000
I'm the first one in the whole school.
Even the principal doesn't have this.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.830
1,500 for this thing?

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.400
Does anyone even call you?

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:30.880
The price doesn't matter.

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.640
What matters is being No. 1.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.190
It shows "partly cloudy turning clear."

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:37.150
Where was I?

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.610
You were talking about being cool.

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:42.950
If you want to be cool,

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.620
get a haircut like Aaron Kwok.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:47.680
Xiaoman!

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.600
My brother wants to know if the
motorcycle magazine has arrived.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.810
It has. I'll bring it over.

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:52.360
Okay.

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:54.110
Xia Lei.

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:55.330
Watch the stall for a while.

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:56.440
I'm going to deliver a magazine.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.900
Okay. I'll wait for our grandma
to come back.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:18:59.590
50 cents.

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:01.000
What do you mean 50 cents?

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.160
Wait, wait. I'll go with you.

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.840
I've never been there before.

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:10.550
This is interesting.

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.750
What?

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:15.510
Isn't this converted from an old plant?

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:17.980
This equipment...

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:21.440
Do you know what this style is called?

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.070
What is it?

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.590
Post-apocalyptic style.

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:24.440
Post-apocalyptic style?

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:25.810
It's just an old rundown plant.

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:27.680
-Your taste needs improvement.
-Enjoy yourself.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.310
Zhigang.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.160
Having fun, huh?

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:30.790
Xiaoman.

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:31.750
Where's Da?

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.290
Da is inside tinkering with a bike.

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:36.890
I'll bring him the magazine.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.350
Da.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.920
-You're here?
-Are you fixing a bike again?

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:43.880
Here's this month's

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:44.640
motorcycle magazine.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.500
I got it for you.

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:46.880
Just leave it there.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.830
What are you working on this time?

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:51.070
Fixing the clutch.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.270
When it's done,

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.810
I'll take you for a ride.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:55.780
Sounds good. Hurry up.

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:56.920
It's been so long

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.320
and it still won't start.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:00.310
Need any help?

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:01.310
Just go play pool.

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:01.830
Okay.

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:06.960
This...

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:08.500
You two have started?

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:13.200
Xiaoman.

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:15.280
Your friend?

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:16.910
My classmate.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.310
Not bad!

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:21.900
You really got it done?

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:24.360
Cool.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.330
Put your hand down.

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:31.350
Who are you pointing at?
Do you even know who he is?

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:32.830
What's wrong?
Why are you picking on a kid?

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:34.110
He's a kid, you know.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:34.750
Wait...

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:35.680
You're new here?

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.480
Your hair.

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:38.230
What about my hair?

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:41.730
Aaron Kwok!

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:44.080
-That's the vibe, huh?
-Right?

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:44.920
You recognized it?

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.180
Aaron Kwok's haircut?

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:48.940
Is this right?

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.200
First guy in our plant
with Aaron Kwok's haircut, right?

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:51.550
Show-off.

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:52.420
You're pretty quick.

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.680
Didn't I tell you
not to mess with my hair?

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.140
First one in our plant.

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:57.850
Not bad.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:20:59.990
Come on!

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:01.200
What's wrong?

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:04.640
Art

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.130
isn't about first or second place.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.300
Give me the cue.

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:10.190
It's fine.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.810
We still have other ways

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.050
to become the coolest guy in our plant.

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:18.760
How is it?

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.080
This thing...

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.650
It's so hard. Can I really learn it?

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:24.450
Why can't you?

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:25.960
Let me tell you,

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.310
I've always had a good eye
for these things.

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:29.710
Your fingers are so long.

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.720
It'd be a waste not to learn guitar.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.570
I don't think I can do it.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.440
Are you doubting yourself or my judgment?

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:38.890
Did you hear?

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:41.750
The anniversary celebration is now open
to outsiders for registration.

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:43.680
Let's do a guitar performance together.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.400
We're going to wow everyone.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:48.480
Us?

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.320
Performing on the anniversary celebration?

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:50.970
That's right.

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:52.730
Give me a break, you liar.

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.170
What do you mean?

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:56.480
There are only this many people
in the plant.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.140
You're the only one, Xiaoman,

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.300
who can stand on stage with me.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.840
I don't deserve that.

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:04.240
I performed at a anniversary celebration
once when I was a kid.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.350
I played the trumpet.

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:06.480
There was a big crowd.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.910
That was a group performance.

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:09.910
Nobody remembers anyone from that.

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:12.050
It's different this time.

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:13.200
This time,

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:15.090
the whole plant belongs to us.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:16.590
Everyone's eyes

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:18.480
will be on us.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.060
You'll be the star.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.000
Are you serious?

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Of course I am.

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.110
If you can really teach me,

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.680
I'll go home and tell my grandma.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.550
-Go ahead.
-I'll bring her to watch.

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:36.280
Absolutely.

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:38.960
Bring our grandma to see

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.960
how her grandson becomes a big star.

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:42.750
Teach me.

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:43.550
How do we do this?

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:44.960
Look, you're a quick learner.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.420
You'll definitely get it right away.
Watch.

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:48.990
Mrs. Zhang, you're back?

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.220
Xiaoman is inside.

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.240
Finished grocery shopping?

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.920
I heard it as soon as I entered the yard.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:05.650
Sounds nice.

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:09.360
My grandma
knows how to praise me the best.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:10.540
In this way,

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:13.450
you're just like your father.

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:27.710
What son doesn't take after his father?

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.270
I don't.

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:30.970
I don't.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.360
Here.

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:40.050
Grandma.

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.830
Peel it yourself.

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:54.330
Xiaoman.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:58.880
Your father has been in the south
for many years now.

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:02.680
And you've grown into a big boy.

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:08.330
I've grown up, and I don't even
remember what he looks like.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.210
His photo is on the table.

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:11.640
How could you forget?

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:15.940
Don't you miss your father at all?

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:18.350
Why should I miss him?

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:20.160
The two of us are doing just fine at home.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.080
Isn't that right, Grandma?

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.510
You think it's good?

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.880
That's because everyone at the plant
looks after you.

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:28.130
They all treat you like their own child.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.330
Do you hate your father?

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:35.840
There's nothing to hate.

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:38.750
Just let him stay in the south

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:40.730
with that demon.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:44.790
Actually, when your father was young,

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.460
he was a key member
of the plant's arts group.

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.350
He played the harmonica.

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:53.770
He played that piece "Chasing the Moon
Among Colorful Clouds."

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.440
In just 3 days, he mastered it.

00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:58.610
As for your mother,

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:01.960
she was a star performer
in the troupe.

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:04.320
They met

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:06.950
during an anniversary celebration.

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:10.830
Anyway, both of them

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.830
are gone now.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.350
Actually, your father and mother

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:19.680
had a really good life
when they were young.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.350
When you were born,

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.740
so many people wanted
to arrange marriages for you.

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:27.070
Everyone said

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:30.070
you'd definitely grow up
to be a handsome young man.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.740
How come I don't remember any of this?

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:38.550
You silly child.

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:39.790
You were so little then.

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:40.990
Just a few months old.

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:44.310
All you did was drink milk, sleep,
and cry.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.540
How could you remember anything?

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:51.070
Your father... I never expected

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:53.480
he would be like that.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.790
I just thought of him as

00:25:57.790 --> 00:25:59.310
a troubled child.

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:02.640
He never tried to improve himself
at the plant.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.480
Drinking, gambling...

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:07.630
Your mother couldn't take it anymore
and left.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.790
Then he turned into such a mess.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:12.760
Grandma, don't worry.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.000
I won't be like them.

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:16.640
I'll stay at home. I won't go anywhere.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:17.640
I'll keep you company

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.480
and we'll have a good life together.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:20.270
Okay.

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.040
I have a good grandson.

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.910
Sometimes I think

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:29.610
your father

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:32.880
couldn't have really abandoned you.

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:36.590
He must have thought that since
I was here to take care of you,

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:38.110
he could go away.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:39.830
I thought

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:42.480
he would come back in a year or two.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.200
But as time went on,

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:47.210
I figured

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:50.240
he must not be doing well out there

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:52.410
and was too ashamed to come back.

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:54.440
What do you think?

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:58.080
Grandma, you don't need
to make excuses for him.

00:26:58.330 --> 00:26:59.410
I don't hate him.

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:02.240
He must be doing well,
that's why he doesn't come back.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:05.100
It's a good thing if he can
have a good life out there.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.070
My grandson is right.

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:10.540
My grandson has such ambition.

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:13.790
In my life,

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:16.030
I got a good grandson.

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:19.830
I guess

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:24.590
if he's really

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:26.310
doing well out there,

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.180
I could

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:33.350
die in peace.

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.940
What are you talking about, Grandma?

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:38.780
With your health,

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:40.810
living another 100 years
would be no problem.

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:41.750
I need to stay by your side.

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:43.750
I should take better care of myself.

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:46.260
Shut up.

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.160
Living another 100 years?

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.560
Isn't that frightening?

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:52.240
What do we have for lunch?

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:55.000
For lunch? Your favorite stewed beans

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:56.110
and potatoes.

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:57.550
Did you buy potatoes?

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:01.410
I'll go wash the potatoes.

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:04.000
I'll wash them, peel them,
and cut them up.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:04.390
Okay.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.790
Then wash
the vegetables thoroughly for me.

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:08.000
I'll get everything ready, and you can
stew them when you come back.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:08.440
Okay.

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.240
I'll go in a bit.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:09.770
Alright.

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:13.180
Great.

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.750
He finally came to terms with it.

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:19.510
I need to go cook.

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.070
Alright.

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.100

I'm proud of you!

Why did the performer change?

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:16.640
-I feel honored because of you!
-The young generation has taken over.

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.700
We are the backbone and marrow

-of the Republic.
-Do you think

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:22.510
our program will work?

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:24.990
Of course!
These are all the same old routine.

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:26.600
The glory!

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.450
Come on, Xu.

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:34.750
I've seen these performances
over 1,000 times.

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:37.510
What's going on?
Don't we have any fresh talent?

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:38.120
Yes, we do.

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:40.310
This year there's a guitar performance.

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:40.590
Right.

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:41.850
A guitar performance?

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.440
By young people?

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:44.330
Yes, by young people.

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:45.510
What song will they sing?

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:47.480
We Workers Have The Power.

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:49.680
That sounds interesting.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.060
-Let them come up then.
-Okay.

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.820

Here!

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.100
I'll make it grand for you.

00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:15.730
They also have a drum.

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:22.110
Plant leaders, hello.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.200
My name is Zhuang Sen.

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:30.550
His name is Zhang Xiaoman.

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.590
We're from the affiliated middle school.

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:37.590
We also share a common identity—

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:40.510
children of the East Chemical Plant.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.450
[Audition for the 30th Anniversary
Celebration of the East Chemical Plant]

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.430
We grew up listening
to our grandfathers' stories about

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:50.830
digging the first shovelful of black soil
to build the plant.

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:52.790
He talks too much.

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:54.310
-Quite a chatterbox.
-Our love for the East Chemical Plant

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:56.480
is deeply rooted in our hearts.

00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:58.880
In the future, we will certainly

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.510
take over the baton from our fathers

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:03.510
and become honorable workers.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.260
So the performance we prepared for today

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:11.400
is a guitar performance

00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:13.830
of We Workers Have The Power.

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:14.830

Bravo!

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.250
Grandma, I have good news for you.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.020
You found money on the ground?

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:05.110
No. I was selected
for our anniversary celebration.

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.640
The anniversary celebration.?

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:12.500
Anyone can participate.

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:15.030
Look at those old ladies in Building 3.

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:16.690
They never miss it every year.

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:20.040
It's different.
This year is completely different.

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:21.380
Everyone was selected by the union.

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:22.510
It's very official.

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:24.680
Zhuang Sen and I were selected together.

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:27.280
Let's go watch it
on the day of the performance.

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:29.150
I'm not going.

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:30.160
Why not?

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:32.720
Every year the seats they give

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:34.280
to the elderly and disabled

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.000
are all in the corners.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.270
I can't see anything even if I go.

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:38.880
Well...

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.640
It's okay, Grandma.
The program has been selected,

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.390
so I'll definitely get you a good seat.

00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:47.180
Go watch it. I'm leaving now.

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:48.470
Okay.

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:56.830
Come in.

00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:59.440
Director Liu.

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:01.130
Zhang Xiaoman?

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:03.550
Your program was quite good.

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:04.570
Quite innovative.

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:05.920
Thank you, Director Liu.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.580
Do you need something from me?

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:08.550
Have a seat.

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:13.850
I'm performing
in this year's celebration, right?

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:16.350
I want to get a ticket for my grandma.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.030
I thought it was something serious.

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:19.770
You're a performer.

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:21.510
Of course we'll arrange tickets
for your family and friends.

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:23.240
Not to mention just one ticket.

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:25.110
Even if you want 3 or 5 tickets,

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:26.970
that wouldn't be a problem at all.

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:28.480
Here, they're all here.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:29.810
-Help yourself.
-Okay.

00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:32.640
So many tickets left this year?

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.000
Director Liu.

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:41.650
My grandma is quite old.

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:44.400
Her eyes and ears aren't so good.

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:46.410
Are there any front-row tickets?

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:48.000
When you're old,

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:50.820
sitting in the back actually gives you
a better view.

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:51.540
Besides,

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:52.960
our plant's

00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:55.780
Workers' Cultural Center
has surround sound.

00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:57.510
Do you know what surround sound is?

00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:59.640
No matter where you sit,

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:01.030
it feels like the sound

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:02.720
is swirling

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:03.580
all around you.

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:04.920
Every seat is the same.

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:07.160
If every seat is the same,

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.699
then just give me a front-row ticket.

00:34:11.199 --> 00:34:13.320
Front-row seats are limited.

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:15.070
We have plant leaders and their families,

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:16.739
branch plant leaders and their families,

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:18.100
labor models,

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:19.630
March 8th Red Flag Bearers,

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:22.550
and those who made contributions
in the early days of the plant.

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:24.080
There aren't enough seats.

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:25.800
Contributions?

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:28.500
My grandpa was a contributor.

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:29.780
He was a war hero.

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:31.070
Your grandpa?

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:32.590
What was his name?

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:33.520
Zhang Hansheng.

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:35.030
My grandma told me

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:37.280
that my grandpa participated in

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.190
the Pingjin Campaign,

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.150
the Liaoshen Campaign,

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:41.230
and the Crossing of the Yangtze.

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:42.800
He was undoubtedly a contributor,
wasn't he?

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.110
Zhang Hansheng. I know him.

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:48.960
Well... your grandpa was indeed a veteran.

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.000
But...

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.550
it seems he never received any citations.

00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:56.480
Have you ever seen

00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:57.730
anything he left behind,

00:34:57.730 --> 00:34:59.600
like certificates or medals?

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.760
You're back?

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:13.650
Let me do it.

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:14.510
I'll handle it.

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:19.480
Where's the beginning part?

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.030
It's here.

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:20.550
Here.

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:22.740
Alright.

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.630
Done?

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.630
Grandma.

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:32.610
My grandpa fought in so many battles.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.630
Don't we have anything

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:36.590
like medals or certificates?

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:37.920
Medals?

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:40.920
I think I saw one before.

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.180
Where is it? Let me see.

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:43.590
I've long forgotten.

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:45.150
I don't know where I put it.

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:47.220
It's nothing special anyway.

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:48.480
Every soldier got one.

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:50.630
So was my grandpa...

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:52.840
a hero?

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:55.410
Of course your grandpa was a hero.

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:57.590
Even if he was just a common soldier,

00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:58.670
he risked his life

00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:00.400
fighting battle after battle.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:03.190
Besides, your grandpa didn't join the army

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:06.120
to earn some medal.

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:10.030
Here.

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:10.620
Yes.

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:13.160
My grandpa was a hero.

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:17.290
Grandma.

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.030
What do you think if I

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.220
join the army like my grandpa did?

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:22.960
Of course that would be great.

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:24.510
Look at your height.

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.140
In a military uniform,

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:30.210
you'd look just as handsome
as your grandpa.

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:32.670
Really?

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:35.150
People always say

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:38.360
that genes skip a generation.

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:39.550
It's quite weird.

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:43.460
Look at your profile and head shape.

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:46.450
They look just like your grandfather's.

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:50.370
The first time I saw your grandpa,

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:52.890
he was wearing a military uniform too.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.840
Among so many people,

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:56.520
he was the only one I saw.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.840
Grandma, you've never told me

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:02.150
the love story between you and Grandpa.

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:03.220
Tell me about it.

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:06.190
You young people...

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:08.150
Always talking about love.

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:13.060
Your grandfather and I just clicked.

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:40.000
Director Liu.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:43.450
Why is it you again?

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:46.520
If you're still asking
for front-row tickets,

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.290
I really can't help you.

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:50.470
Director Liu.

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:55.880
As Xiaoman's partner,

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.150
I think

00:37:57.610 --> 00:38:00.450
you could consider
giving him a front-row ticket

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:01.710
to satisfy his needs.

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.070
Front-row tickets are limited.

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:05.150
You can't expect me

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:06.880
to conjure up a front-row seat.

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:10.590
Well, if that's the case,

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:14.410
we're withdrawing from this year's
anniversary celebration.

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:17.880
As for this anniversary celebration,

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:18.960
because of your mistake,

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.760
you lost the biggest highlight.

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:22.850
I think you need to think about that.

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:39.610
I didn't expect Liu to be so tough.

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:43.020
He actually removed our performance
from the program.

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:49.440
Zhuang Cent.

00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:51.500
This time...

00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:53.490
I'm really sorry.

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:56.810
Just for getting me a ticket...

00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:58.490
It's fine.

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:00.280
I, Zhuang C—

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:01.880
Zhuang Sen,

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.040
never give up.

00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:07.210
Right.

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:08.840
Didn't you say

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.510
he still has quite a few tickets
that haven't been distributed?

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:13.110
There are plenty left.
They're all over there.

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:15.760
Then I know what to do.

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:16.890
What do you mean?

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:18.710
Just watch.

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:22.600
Director Liu!

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:24.510
Director Liu!

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:25.550
What are you doing?

00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:26.280
I'm sorry.

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:28.860
I got carried away just now.

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:31.130
Please be magnanimous

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:32.470
and forgive us this once.

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:33.360
Yes, Director Liu.

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:34.890
We promise to perform well.

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:38.710
-We'll definitely do our best
-We will do our best.

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:40.910
for the anniversary celebration. Yes.

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:43.550
Your attitude is quite good.

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:45.710
Young people,

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:48.710
don't keep challenging the plant

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.430
and the leadership, okay?

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:52.710
-Yes.
-Yes, sir.

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:55.400
About this anniversary celebration,

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:56.840
it won't make much difference
if you're in it

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:57.840
or if you're not.

00:39:57.860 --> 00:39:58.500
Yes.

00:39:58.520 --> 00:39:59.320
Absolutely right.

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:00.900
Don't think too highly of yourself.

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:01.650
Yes.

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:04.070
So you agreed to let us perform?

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:10.550
Considering your good attitude.

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:12.110
But don't let this happen again.

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:13.280
Thank you, Director Liu.

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:14.230
-Sure.
-Thank you, Director Liu.

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:14.830
Director.

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:17.710
About that front-row ticket...

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:19.590
Will you ever stop?

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:20.550
There are no tickets.

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:21.340
Perform or don't.

00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:22.150
Director Liu.

00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:25.630
I heard that many tickets
weren't given out.

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:28.230
Who said that? Who told you?

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:29.150
No one. I didn't hear it from anyone.

00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:30.590
I specifically reserved those

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:32.510
for the staff's

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:33.760
friends and family.

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:34.880
I understand.

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:36.880
If you need,

00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:39.930
I can help you
distribute all these tickets.

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:41.980
Really?

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:42.930
Would I lie?

00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:43.800
Absolutely!

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.530
He can do it. He can handle this.

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:48.300
I guarantee the anniversary celebration
will be packed

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:49.420
and lively.

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:53.480
So who do you plan
to give these tickets to?

00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:55.440
You don't trust me, Zuang Cent—

00:40:58.040 --> 00:40:59.370
He always calls me that.

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:00.840
Zhuang Sen's influence.

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:03.700
My classmates—

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:06.040
if they know Xiaoman and I will perform

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.920
on such a big stage at our plant,

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.620
they'll be jumping to come!

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:11.620
They'll all come.

00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:12.540
Right.

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:14.890
Alright.

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.110
Second row, center.

00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:23.840
I really don't have better tickets.

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:25.550
I knew you had extra tickets!

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:26.960
Extra my foot.

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.360
This is my wife's ticket.

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:30.630
That's not appropriate.

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:32.490
How will you explain this at home?

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:34.610
I can make this decision.

00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:36.920
We need to prioritize the bigger picture.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:37.550
Thank you so much.

00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:40.440
Besides, my wife
understands the bigger picture too.

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:43.300
Here are the tickets.
Come get more if you need them.

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:46.480
But you two must guarantee that...

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:47.340
I guarantee it.

00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:49.210
I, Zhuang Sen,
guarantee to complete the mission.

00:41:49.210 --> 00:41:51.340
If I fail, I'll quit the stage forever.

00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:52.920
I'll go to our plant gate

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:53.780
and read a self-criticism.

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:54.280
Right?

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.610
Stop talking nonsense.

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:56.840
Xiaoman,

00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:58.030
do your best.

00:41:58.030 --> 00:41:59.230
Perform well for your grandma.

00:41:59.230 --> 00:41:59.960
Don't worry.

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:01.030
Go on.

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:02.550
Thank you, Director Liu.

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:03.950
Thank you, Director Liu.

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:06.760
The middle seat ticket?

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:07.510
Got it, huh?

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.260
Stop calling me Sun Cent anymore.

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:11.230
Zhuang Sen,

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:13.800
you're really good at acting humble.

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:14.460
Seriously.

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.670
Shut up.

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:17.070
Grandma!

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:18.370
Grandma!

00:42:19.650 --> 00:42:20.790
I got the ticket. See?

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:21.550
I got the ticket.

00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:22.840
What are you being cocky about this time?

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:23.630
Come inside.

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:27.670
Grandma, I got it.

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:30.030
Second row, middle seat.

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:32.520
You can see everything from there.

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:33.670
Exactly.

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:36.340
My grandson is so capable.

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:38.800
Well, I always make sure
everything's perfect for my grandma.

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:39.770
Alright, I'm going now.

00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:41.070
Wait, don't go yet. Come here.

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:43.430
Let me take your measurements. Come on.

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:44.550
What's this? For my waist?

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:45.430
Yes.

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:46.550
It's too big.

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.540
It's too big this year,

00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:50.670
but it'll fit perfectly in a year or two.

00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:52.190
Fine. You keep knitting. I'm leaving.
