[Born to Be Alive]

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.210
[Episode 31]

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.150
It was so chaotic back then.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:46.970
Bullets

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.400
were flying everywhere.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.450
Who had time to observe details?

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.430
I only remember

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.200
some people
being very accurate with their shots.

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.280
Much better than us.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.270
Can you be more specific?

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.630
Details that seem

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.840
insignificant to you

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:19.430
might play a decisive role

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.680
in our work.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.620
We've also asked

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.070
Shao Yunfei and Sangba.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.810
They went into great detail.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:26.930
So we hope you two

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.990
can try to

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.300
remember a bit more.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.130
Eat up.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.950
Interviewing those two

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.579
is more tiring
than interrogating suspects.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:54.500
Why didn't you

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.560
say a word just now?

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.140
The Mazhi Hongyuan Freight Company

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.470
and the Qima'er Gold Minefrom back then,

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.330
and the current Xinhai Coal Mine—

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:07.620
we need to know

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.360
more about them.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.390
After all,

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.800
17 years have passed.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.850
The clues are scarce.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.090
The Hongyuan employee list

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.490
is missing another page.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.230
What are they whispering

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.960
about?

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.170
Us, I think.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.040
I can't hear anything.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:25.460
Yeah.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.740
Let's watch TV!

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.780
The police are catching a thief!

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.750
The same gun appeared

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.840
at the Qima'er Gold Mine

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.910
and at the scene

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.579
of the unnamed corpse.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.780
And the boss of both the Qima'er Gold Mine

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:48.900
and Hongyuan Freight Company

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.190
is Li Yongqiang.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.840
Xinhai's Vice President, Wu Jiang,

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.400
used to work

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.430
for Li Yongqiang.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.860
I hope that

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.970
while we are investigating other employees

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.630
at Hongyuan Freight Company,

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.800
we can also look into people
connected to Wu Jiang

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.020
at Xinhai Group.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.340
Investigating Hongyuan is reasonable.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.030
But investigating Xinhai...

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.630
Don't you suspect Wu Jiang too?

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.029
That's just a suspicion.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.390
Xinhai is a key corporation in the city.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.860
With these doubts,

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.329
they wouldn't approve

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.800
our request for surveillance.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.030
Let's try.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:29.220
Let's see

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.930
if there is

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:30.770
any other way.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.310
Any other way...

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:49.930
Is she looking at us?

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:52.620
No, no.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.620
Xinhai

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:56.360
is going to acquire

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.890
the coal mine on our pasture, right?

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:58.570
Yeah.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.090
Bai Chun,
whom you couldn't beat last time,

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.030
is now a mine manager there.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.570
What do you mean "couldn't beat"?

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.000
It was a tie, okay?

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.930
Keep bragging.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.690
Our mine

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.480
is currently performing very well.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.690
Sales are great too.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.060
There's just one problem.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.930
It's simply that the mine's

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.040
production capacity is insufficient.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.040
So I'm thinking

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.930
of expanding the capacity a bit.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.920
Two.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.810
Just two.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:40.890
Two million tons.

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:41.940
Mayor Lin, what do you think?

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:42.670
Is that okay?

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.430
Two million tons?

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.500
Not even one ton.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.950
Don't you know?

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.330
The city

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.560
is already consolidating
and limiting production.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.390
No mines are allowed

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:52.850
to expand capacity at all.

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.790
Mayor Lin,

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:54.860
I just want...

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.480
That's enough. Go back now.

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:57.720
This isn't a place

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.980
for me to discuss work.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.190
Let me take a walk in peace.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.830
Alright.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:11.140
Uncle Lin.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.960
Good morning.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.960
Morning.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.180
Even during your morning exercise,

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.830
people come to find you

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:16.830
to report on work?

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.830
These small mine owners

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.660
stick like glue wherever I go.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.000
While we're trying to consolidate,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.120
they're still thinking about
expanding capacity.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.320
How is that possible?

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:29.300
In the end,

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:31.810
it's still about balancing

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.190
environmental protection and development.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:34.920
If it weren't for you

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.250
insisting on focusing on development,

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.760
the city's economy

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.630
wouldn't be doing so well.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:38.240
Not to mention,

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.950
this sports field

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.680
wouldn't even have been built.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.720
By the way,

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.420
I read the report

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:45.430
you just published

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:46.370
on the desert-combat heroes.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.900
It was really well written.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.330
You could dig more

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.430
into these

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:50.980
environmental stories

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:51.770
in Tianduo.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:54.060
Yes.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.690
Desert-combat heroes,

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.260
the Bird Lama,

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.800
and the snow leopard expert.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.720
This week, I'm going to

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.920
interview that...

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.050
that Doctor Yak.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.480
From the way you talk,

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:08.690
it sounds like

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.740
you're not very willing
to write about these.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:11.690
Do you think these people

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:12.690
and these stories

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.480
aren't worth publicizing?

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.280
Of course not.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.220
They are all very important.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:19.500
But these

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:21.320
aren't the main reason

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.320
I came to Tianduo.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:23.750
As you know,

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.430
I still want to write about Xinhai.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:27.990
So, how is it going?

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.250
Is the interview progressing smoothly?

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.230
There's a lot of resistance.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:34.570
I've called the Coal Bureau and Xinhai

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:35.750
several times,

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.830
but got no reply.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.650
I couldn't get

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.210
any meaningful data at all.

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:42.790
That's normal.

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:45.230
Think about it—

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:46.850
the consolidation work

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:47.850
has just started.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.270
The Coal Bureau and the companies

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.409
are swamped.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.110
It's normal that they don't have time

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:54.180
to see you.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.360
Even if Xinhai

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:58.090
really has problems,

00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.920
it's not up to you

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.010
to fix it alone.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.220
You need to trust the regulatory power

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.420
of the industry and commerce departments

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.690
and environmental protection departments.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:06.290
Uncle Lin.

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:08.250
Since you call me "Uncle,"

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:10.740
there are some things

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.300
I have to tell you.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:14.510
Go ahead. I'm listening.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.570
As a reporter,

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:19.790
don't always look for the dark side.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.990
Coal mine consolidation is a good thing.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:24.300
Even if there are problems,

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.240
they're minor.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:29.070
You finally came back.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:30.930
The top priority

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.140
is to take care of your family.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:35.799
Uncle Lin.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:38.500
I want to say that...

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:40.270
You know my relationship

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.400
with the Bai family.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:42.770
Bai Ju hasn't had it easy

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:44.059
over the years.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:45.500
You know

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:46.320
her hang-ups.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.420
You should try to persuade her more

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:49.750
from your perspective.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.290
Things aren't like they were

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:52.450
a few years ago.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:54.470
Your child has grown up now.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:55.570
Even if you

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.330
don't think about yourselves,

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.400
you have to think about your kid.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:00.620
If she wants

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.550
to work in the provincial capital,

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:03.870
I can recommend her.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.620
Then she'll have time

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.110
to be with the child.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:10.380
Wouldn't that be great?

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:11.830
What do you think?

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:15.650
Shao,

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:16.760
are you okay?

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:18.750
Relax. Relax.

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:19.790
You...

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:20.900
Altitude sickness.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:21.570
It's altitude sickness.

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:22.310
Look at you.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:23.600
This young body

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:24.530
is useless.

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:26.000
Relax. Relax.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:26.480
Come on.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.360
Breathe slowly. Breathe slowly.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.580
You're really something.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.270
You actually let Uncle Lin

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:37.600
talk you into fainting.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.170
I haven't been back

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:40.240
for a long time.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.270
At this altitude,

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:42.030
of course I'm not used to

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:43.430
doing aerobic exercise.

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:45.440
Mr. Cheng.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:46.860
You're off work now?

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.820
The usual.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.390
Okay, take a seat. It'll be ready soon.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:51.240
Noodles with spicy minced meat
and chili oil!

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.500
Extra oil, extra meat!

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.840
Here you are.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.490
Here's a Coke. On the house.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.210
Thanks.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.570
You're welcome.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.770
This. See?

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:18.120
I see you

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:19.340
never get a break.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.100
Doesn't Xinhai Transport

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.620
pay you a little extra?

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:25.330
Extra?

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:27.070
I'd be lucky if they didn't dock my pay.

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:27.840
They do that?

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:32.770
I was thinking of having my brother

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:34.780
quit his job at the saltworks back home

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.740
and come to Xinhai to find some work.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.000
But the pay isn't good.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:40.050
Your brother?

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.000
Isn't he your brother?

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:44.150
No.

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.910
He... he's my brother-in-law.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.530
Ex... ex-brother-in-law.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:51.100
Ex-brother-in-law.
His sister and I got divorced.

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:51.870
But it looks like you two

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.130
get along pretty well.

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:54.170
Why don't you

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:55.670
ask Mr. Bai to help your brother

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:56.670
get a job?

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.340
Mr. Bai is stingy.

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:01.740
What are you talking about?

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.440
That store of mine in the city

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.030
isn't running as well as

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.960
this small shop.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:06.860
I'm counting on you guys

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:07.790
to look after me.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.630
With the rectification now,

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.090
work must be tough, right?

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.170
There's plenty of work at the mines.

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:19.680
Mostly three shifts.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.180
The harder I work, the more I earn.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.480
All the mines
are undergoing rectification now.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.340
How come it's still three shifts?

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:37.030
Mr. Cheng,

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.280
you're from Baolin too, right?

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.100
You and my brother-in-law

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.450
are from the same place.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.610
You're from Baolin?

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:48.440
That's rare in Tianduo.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.120
You're from there?

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:49.820
Yeah.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:50.900
You don't have an accent.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:51.360
Well...

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:52.650
Let me tell you,

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:53.620
here's the thing.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.340
My brother and I—

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:55.410
my real brother—

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:56.390
came here with our parents

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:57.190
when we were little.

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:58.650
So I don't have a hometown accent.

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:00.220
But my taste hasn't changed.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:00.860
I still like

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:01.890
food from back home.

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:02.670
Just now when I saw you

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:03.340
eating that chili oil,

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:03.940
I felt like

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:05.370
we must be from the same place.

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:05.770
Right.

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:06.290
Right?

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:07.740
Back home,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.070
they make it with dry chili.

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:09.550
Yes.

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:10.650
It tastes better than this.

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:11.630
Much better.

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:12.480
Later on,

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.150
I'll bring some over for you.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.000
Okay.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:18.560
How about this?

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.000
If it really doesn't work,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.710
just have your brother come over.

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:23.240
I'll take him under my wing.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:24.160
That's wonderful.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.490
I'll let him know later.

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:27.260
That's great.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:32.530
You just said

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:35.080
there's a lot of work here. Is it for

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.560
Xinhai's rectification?

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:38.720
Exactly.

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:41.630
Every day we're hauling stuff to Chenlong.

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:42.830
That's a good gig.

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.680
It's close.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.480
You don't need to leave the mine.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.180
Everyone's fighting for it.

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:52.050
Chenlong.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:53.870
Cheng,

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.410
time to get back to work.

00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:58.410
Coming.

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:00.470
It's 11.50, right?

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.330
Just give me 10.

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:04.200
Just give me 10.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:04.750
Let me...

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:05.950
Let me take this Coke.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:06.600
Okay.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:07.960
Be caeful.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:09.320
Yunfei,

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:10.100
you've got to

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:10.820
top up here.

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:12.000
Top up?

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:13.750
For what?

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:15.720
Support my business.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.150
Your business is fine.

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:18.480
Why should I support it?

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:20.280
So, I helped for nothing?

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:21.950
If you help,

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:23.550
you should help all the way.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:24.500
After all these meals,

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.200
Mr. Cheng and I

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.010
are only nodding acquaintances.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:26.600
Nodding acquaintances?

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.460
How is that not helping all the way?

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:28.550
We just started talking.

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:29.440
But your brother...

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.140
Just started.

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:30.840
He said...

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:31.570
Just a few words.

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:32.430
Let me tell you.

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:41.430
Okay.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:43.070
Coming right up.

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:43.510
Alright.

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:44.050
Where are you going?

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:44.570
Where are you going?

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:45.630
I have things to do.

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:47.370
Are you going to top up or not?

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:49.220
I'll top up 20 next time.

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:49.790
20?

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.280
Don't come back next time.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:54.510
Are you cold?

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.250
I'm not.

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:56.990
The weather changes so fast.

00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:59.120
Your mom didn't

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.030
even dress you warmly enough.

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:01.030
I'm not cold.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:02.110
Alright, alright.

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:08.280
Dad.

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:09.000
What?

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.690
Why are you so happy?

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:12.550
Is it obvious?

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:13.550
I may be young,

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:14.760
but I'm not stupid.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:15.750
Your teacher

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:16.480
called me to school today.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.410
I'm quite happy.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.290
It's not a good thing.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:21.480
But this is my first time

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:22.750
being called to school

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:24.010
as a parent.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:26.000
Besides,

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:27.510
I'm an expert at getting criticized.

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:29.060
I get scolded a lot at work.

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.780
Then why aren't you scolding me?

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:34.390
Why would I?

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.030
Because I got into a fight.

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:38.820
That's because that boy

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:39.500
started it.

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:40.890
He pulled your ponytail first.

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:41.410
Right.

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:42.460
And that wasn't

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:43.320
the first time.

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:44.480
I hit him last time too.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.620
But he never learns.

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:46.180
Alright.

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:48.230
Listen to me, Zhuling.

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:50.430
When someone bullies us,

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.030
we must protect ourselves.

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:53.270
This is called self-defense.

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:54.290
But self-defense

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:55.010
has limits...

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:55.910
If he messes with me again,

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:56.970
I'll hit him again.

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:58.780
I haven't used this move yet.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.290
Who taught you that?

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:04.240
Your mom?

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:04.790
Yeah.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.620
That sounds like your mom.

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:11.900
Let me tell you, these...

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.040
these moves

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:14.230
are only for bad guys.

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:15.540
You can't use them on your classmates.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:16.140
Got it?

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:18.150
I'm talking to you.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.980
Listen to me.

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:22.070
Self-defense is right.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:23.530
But

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:24.480
it must be within

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.700
reasonable limits.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:26.270
Otherwise,

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:27.530
you would hurt others.

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:28.080
Next time,

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.170
when he pulls your ponytail again,

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:30.390
you can tell the teacher

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:31.250
or us.

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:32.290
But at that moment,

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:33.270
do you know

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:35.340
what the most important thing to do is?

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:36.000
What is it?

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:38.570
What is it?

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:41.390
Run!

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.010
Pull your ponytail!

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:49.350
Here.

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.030
The soup is ready. Have some.

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:52.490
I'm full. I don't want any.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.770
I'm going to your study to do my homework.

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:55.300
Go ahead.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:04.020
What did the teacher say today?

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:07.550
Both of them got punished.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.960
Both sides were at fault.

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:09.980
I have, um...

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.370
severely

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.160
criticized her.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.100
You?

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:15.820
Criticize her?

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:22.470
I'll teach her a good lesson later.

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:23.070
Don't.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:24.640
She promised me

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:26.930
she would never hit anyone again.

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:30.330
Don't you believe it?

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.750
I'm good at reasoning with people.

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:42.750
Recently,

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:45.650
have you been in touch with Meng Yaohui?

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:50.860
I'm very tired today.

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:52.760
I don't have time to bicker with you.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.420
I just want to have a good meal.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.170
Shao Yunfei.

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:04.140
Look at this.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.270
I'm sitting right across from you.

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:06.180
Just say it directly, okay?

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:07.310
Just take a look.

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:11.660
These are all things I wrote

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:14.190
after I arrived
at the Tianduo press station.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.609
There's even one about Doctor Yak.

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:17.410
It'll be published in a few days.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.400
I didn't come here

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:23.460
just to write these things.

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:29.060
Then you can go back.

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:29.900
No one is forcing you

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:30.790
to stay here.

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:31.960
Don't you know

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:32.560
why exactly

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.620
I am staying here?

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.740
I...

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:40.310
I want you...

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:41.640
We agreed on this.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:42.990
Right now, I can't...

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:43.670
I want you to

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.030
help me get into Xinhai.

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:50.590
Well, for that,

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:52.080
you can go straight to Bai Chun.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.310
Why go through all this trouble?

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:54.730
He's never liked me.

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:55.900
You know that.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:59.890
Why are you so obsessed

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:00.740
with Xinhai?

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:03.350
Rectification.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:04.110
I found that now,

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:05.420
they're just using a new name

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:06.020
to make all the small coal mines

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:06.970
part of Xinhai.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:07.870
The problems that need fixing

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:09.400
probably weren't touched.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:10.630
Then you can report these things

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:12.390
to the Coal Bureau

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:14.030
or tell Uncle Lin.

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:15.880
What can I report?

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.610
I can't just make empty claims.

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.180
Not only do you need evidence

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:20.640
for your investigations,

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:22.760
but we also need it for our reports.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.240
I heard that several small mines,

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.370
after being merged,

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:26.380
stopped briefly

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:28.180
and then started operating again.

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:29.960
The transport drivers are all busy.

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:30.760
As a reporter,

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:31.240
if I see it,

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.640
I can't pretend I didn't.

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.720
This is an open-pit mine.

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:48.760
Really impressive.

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:50.210
Eye-opening, huh?

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:52.080
Yes, indeed.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:18:58.960
Chun,

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:00.790
why don't you go back to your work?

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:01.280
I guess

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:03.310
we'll still be shooting for a while.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.310
If I don't let him take enough photos,

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:06.840
he'll come bother me again,

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:08.950
and then I'll have to come bother you.

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:10.950
It's okay. I don't mind.

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:12.010
I'll stay with you.

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:14.420
Manager Bai! Manager Bai!

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:15.220
What's wrong?

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:17.110
The hydraulic shovel down here
is malfunctioning.

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:18.880
The hydraulic shovel is malfunctioning.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.010
Is it turned off now?

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:21.910
Is there any safety issue?

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.320
It's already turned off.

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.250
Please hurry down and take a look.

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:26.330
Chun,

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:27.820
go do your work.

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:29.720
Yes, go do your work.

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.020
There's only this one road, right?

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:32.420
We can walk by ourselves.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:38.210
You can only take photos here.

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:39.250
We're not trying to

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:40.070
cover anything up.

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:41.940
It's just that our industry
is quite sensitive.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:42.240
About that...

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:42.970
Don't worry.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.050
I still have

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:45.180
my professional ethics.

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:46.140
If he dares to take photos recklessly,

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.210
I'll break his hands.

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:47.940
Don't worry.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.570
Finish shooting quickly and leave.

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:51.940
Okay.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:52.890
I'm coming down.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.220
Be careful.

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:40.050
Han?

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:41.960
Why is Han standing there?

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:44.980
Didn't you see him?

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:45.550
Han opened

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:46.260
the roadblock for us.

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:47.190
Did you see that?

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:55.540
Are you

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:57.100
keeping something from me?

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:26.340
[Chenlong Coal Mine]

00:21:57.930 --> 00:21:58.900
Mr. Meng.

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:00.860
Why didn't you tell me

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:01.810
you were coming?

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.380
I would have picked you up.

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:05.520
I already told my brother.

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:08.010
I just want to come in and have a look.

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:09.270
What do you want to see?

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:10.900
Here at our mine,

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.760
there are no security incidents.

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:15.330
Hello, Mr. Meng.

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:17.460
I asked her to bring me here.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:18.590
Doesn't the city

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:19.110
want a report

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:20.160
on Xinhai's consolidation?

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.290
I'm a bit short on material

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:22.890
and want to take some photos.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:25.740
Sure.

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:26.710
No problem.

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:28.900
Actually,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.510
regarding dust suppression,

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:31.330
open-pit mines

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:33.290
aren't as complicated
as underground mines.

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:35.160
Mainly it's water spraying

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:36.850
and covering with dust nets.

00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:37.900
As for us,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.440
we apply a combination of water spraying

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.540
and chemical suppressants.

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:45.220
We also optimized blasting techniques.

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:46.720
But we can't

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:48.610
demonstrate that to you on-site.

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:50.170
Mr. Meng.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.240
Well...

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:54.870
Mine No. 2 we're looking at now

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:56.190
isn't much different

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:57.820
from Mine No. 1 we saw before.

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:02.210
Why can't you show us

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:03.530
Chenlong Mine?

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.110
Chenlong is undergoing
dust equipment maintenance

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:09.370
and slope management.

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:12.550
Didn't you want to see the rectification?

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:13.950
Mine No. 2 is the focus

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:16.030
of our rectification work right now.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.130
It seems that you have

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:22.320
plenty of material.

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:25.840
You brought that camera in
but didn't take many photos.

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.010
I... I did.

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:29.280
I just took a lot.

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:29.730
Look.

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:31.900
Look.

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:32.960
Here they are.

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:33.830
See?

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:36.890
It's out of focus.

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:39.710
What's wrong with you?

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:40.400
How is it...

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.290
How is it out of focus?

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:42.920
How did you...

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:43.660
Didn't I take photos

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.390
of that Bird Lama a few days ago?

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:46.330
I held the camera up for ages,

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:47.380
but the bird didn't come.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.380
My arm started hurting afterwards.

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:50.510
Let me retake a few.

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:52.910
Let me try.

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.800
Okay.

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:55.840
You... you do it.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:10.820
Take a look.

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:12.140
Not bad. Not bad.

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.300
The scenery up there is nice.

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:41.340
[Meng Yaohui, General Manager]

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:42.890
It's great to be young.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:44.050
Right?

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.800
It reminds me of my younger days,

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:48.740
studying at the sports academy.

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:50.920
Mr. Meng, you went from a sports student

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.520
to the coal mining industry.

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:54.170
That's quite a leap.

00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:57.400
I only remember

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.490
some people
being very accurate with their shots.

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:02.010
Much better than us.

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:08.680
Who authorized you to bring that reporter

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.270
into the mine to take photos?

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:10.940
Mr. Feng,

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.030
guiding public opinion

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:15.650
is about channeling, not blocking.

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:17.240
This is

00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:18.590
all beneficial for us.

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:21.740
That reporter, Shao,

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:23.690
has been keeping a close eye on us.

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:24.790
And last time,
the Environmental Protection Bureau

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:25.720
couldn't get in.

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:27.180
If this keeps up,

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:28.590
with a surprise inspection one day

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:29.510
and a complaint the next,

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:30.060
it'll unsettle everyone

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:31.140
at the mine.

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:33.550
I thought

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.200
it would be better
if we took the initiative,

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.290
so they wouldn't try

00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:37.330
any sneaky ways to get in,

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:39.190
which would be more troublesome.

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:41.420
They only saw

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:43.410
what I wanted them to see.

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:45.110
Everything was legal and compliant.

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:46.640
No one could find any fault.

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:01.070
Has that police officer
from the task force

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:02.470
made any moves recently?

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:04.820
She tracked down Hongyuan Freight Company.

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:06.220
There's no progress yet.

00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:08.270
I'll keep an eye on her.

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:12.110
I thought
you wouldn't contact me proactively

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:12.850
anymore.

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:14.890
This is to thank you

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.920
for taking us inside to take photos.

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:19.030
I don't like

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:20.760
making friends with a purpose.

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:23.560
But once we're friends,

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:26.430
isn't it normal
to help each other out a bit?

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:29.770
That day at the mine,

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:30.670
I saw you

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.160
speaking so confidently.

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:33.500
I didn't expect you

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:34.230
to be a leader

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:35.980
who really knows the business.

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:37.750
If I didn't,

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:38.840
how could I work at the mine?

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.500
Would the workers respect me?

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:43.860
My brother said something similar.

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:47.370
Yeah.

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:50.110
He went from the army to the saltworks,

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:51.230
and then to the coal mine.

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:52.490
He had more to adapt to.

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:55.450
It was harder for him.

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:58.180
At least you're a college graduate.

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:00.850
You mean a sports academy graduate.

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:01.680
I only got

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.140
an empty diploma from there.

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:04.380
I'm uncultured.

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:07.610
Last time I saw you holding the camera,

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:09.070
you held it very steadily.

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:09.980
Were you

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:11.670
a weightlifter before?

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:14.750
With my build? Weightlifting?

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:17.340
Back then,

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:18.300
we didn't have

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:19.480
a weightlifting major.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.940
I don't know if they do now.

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:23.660
I trained in air rifle.

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:24.420
Shooting.

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:26.960
But I haven't practiced in years.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:28.910
I can only hold a camera steady now.

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:31.700
You're quite honest.

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:34.380
There's nothing to hide.

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:35.640
Besides,

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.180
you're a police officer.

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:38.510
I can't fool you anyway.

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:43.070
After you graduated
from the sports academy,

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:44.800
have you ever fired a gun again?

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:46.040
Fired a gun?

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:47.400
Where can I even get one?

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:50.890
What about the Uninhabited Zone?

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.380
Have you been in there?

00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:58.830
You finally asked me

00:27:58.830 --> 00:27:59.510
about this.

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:00.780
I did

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.130
go into that place once.

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:04.080
As a fossicker.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.820
It was the first time
I wanted to touch a gun again

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:07.690
and the first time

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:09.750
I wanted to use a gun to shoot someone.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.820
I wanted to kill

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:12.900
all the ringleaders,

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:13.890
then escape

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.320
with the brothers there.

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:18.080
After all, in a place like that,

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.160
you don't even need to bury the bodies.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.160
No one would know.

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:24.010
Only the vultures in the sky would know.

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:29.400
It's not illegal to think about it, right?

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:33.250
Why did you

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:34.900
enter Bolamula back then?

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:37.660
Going there to make money,

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:39.270
you may die

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:40.710
before you can spend it.

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.480
I was young.

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:43.990
I just wanted fast money.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.840
I didn't have a family
to tie me down anyway.

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:47.810
But after I went in,

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:49.000
I got scared.

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:50.350
So I never wanted

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:51.510
to go back again.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.680
After that, I went to Guangdong to work.

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.110
In the 90s,

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.220
I heard it was developing fast there.

00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:59.160
After I went there, I realized

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.360
there were indeed many opportunities,

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:02.920
but none of them were for me.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:09.790
Excuse me.

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:10.850
I need to take this.

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:14.160
Hello?

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:16.540
When are you coming back?

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:19.580
I'm working overtime right now.

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:20.780
Mom, have some water.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.160
Shao is here.

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:26.460
I heard that.

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:28.830
He even bought you a birthday cake.

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:31.920
I'm...

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:32.480
Mom,

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:34.410
you should come back later.

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:36.500
Or you'll fight with Dad again.

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:37.050
Shush.

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:37.700
Don't eat too much cake.

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:38.330
Be quiet.

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:39.110
Mom,

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:40.510
keep an eye on her for me.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:41.790
I know.

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.190
Come back soon.

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.160
She'll be back. In a while.

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:48.070
It's fine.

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:49.020
No rush.

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:56.810
Officer Bai, you're really dedicated.

00:29:56.810 --> 00:29:59.070
You're working overtime to question me.

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:00.170
Then next time,

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.140
should I just invite you to my office?

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:03.470
Well...

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.340
then you'll need...

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:06.400
an arrest warrant.

00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:09.030
Alright.

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:10.930
I'll treat you to a meal sometime.

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:13.130
I'll send you home.

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:14.940
Okay.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:35.770
Where are you going?

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.220
Women are not easy to fool.

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:42.740
Female police officers
are more difficult to fool.

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:45.270
Meng Yaohui.

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.220
What are you doing?

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:49.470
I'm taking you to a place.

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:51.990
Work overtime a bit longer, okay?

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:11.110
Sometimes when work gets annoying,

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:12.060
I come here alone

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:13.020
to clear my head.

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:15.580
It's sort of an oasis.

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:19.650
Why are you being so poetic
all of a sudden?

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.630
Don't tell people

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:23.260
you're uncultured anymore.

00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:25.090
This is an oasis.

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:27.050
Really.

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:29.680
What do you mean?

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:32.110
This

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:33.150
used to be

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:34.510
a bare, barren hill.

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:37.220
Our group handled the greening.

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:39.500
That was the first project

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.030
I was in charge of at Xinhai.

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.930
Profit is the only motivation.

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:45.790
Don't tell me your boss

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:46.850
your boss actually has

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:48.250
environmental ideals.

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:49.460
Well,

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:50.950
he doesn't.

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:54.680
The company originally wanted to build

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:55.940
a city park.

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:58.590
The group wanted to develop tourism.

00:31:58.750 --> 00:31:59.550
But Tianduo

00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:00.340
really doesn't have much

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:01.470
tourism potential,

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:02.420
so we dropped it.

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:04.250
True.

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:05.990
Just dig more coal,

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.270
and the money for greening

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:08.400
will be earned back.

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.730
Judge by results, not intentions.

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:17.390
No matter the starting point,

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.120
this hill is green now.

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:21.250
Isn't that

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:22.350
a good thing?

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:25.010
Just like

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:26.740
when Duojie started

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:27.770
the Mazhi Economic Development Company,

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:28.490
it was not

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:29.980
for wildlife protection.

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:30.920
But in the end,

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:31.930
you really promoted

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:33.860
the establishment of the reserve.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.200
Sometimes

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:37.600
the starting point and the process

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.490
may deviate,

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:41.100
but the result is what matters,

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:41.660
right?

00:32:59.070 --> 00:32:59.940
Work?

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:09.220
You're actually hiding it from me.

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:14.340
It's from a woman.

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:15.910
Want to see?

00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:16.830
No need.

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:18.230
I'm not interested

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:19.490
in your romantic life.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.240
Unless it involves vice.

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:34.200
Happy Birthday.

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:38.980
Thanks.

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:51.160
How is it going?

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:53.380
Things are stable here for now.

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:54.250
Work?

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:56.980
It's from a woman.

00:33:57.270 --> 00:33:57.930
Want to see?

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:07.290
Mom.

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.070
Zhuling ate all the cake.

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:13.650
Yes.

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.199
Fine.

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:17.610
When Bai Ju comes back

00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:18.810
and demands answers,

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:20.310
I'll let her find you.

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:22.780
It was my fault.

00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:25.070
I'm soft-hearted.

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:29.070
Do you plan to just

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:30.469
keep visiting like this?

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:35.280
Well,

00:34:36.929 --> 00:34:38.360
it's not up to me.

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:39.460
It's up to Bai Ju.

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:41.580
I rented the place for a year.

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:43.010
Visiting for a year is fine,

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:44.870
but I can't keep visting forever.

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:48.320
All these years,

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.340
I've never said anything,

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:53.150
mostly because there hasn't been

00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:54.380
a right time.

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:57.240
You said things between us didn't change,

00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:59.240
and that you would still call me Mom.

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:00.840
No matter what you think,

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:02.820
in my heart—

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:05.350
let me put it this way—

00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:07.460
even if you two

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:09.640
start your own families in the future,

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.770
I still consider you

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:11.910
my own child.

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:17.570
Mom.

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:21.820
The separation

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:23.700
wasn't either of your fault.

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:26.690
Before,

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:30.280
you took
a three-year assignment for Bai Ju.

00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:32.380
After you went back,

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:34.290
you waited years for her.

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:36.440
You've been very patient.

00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:39.210
But some things

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.130
depend on fate.

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:44.050
You can't force them.

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:48.150
I wasn't

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:49.700
always mature either.

00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:53.860
I knew Bai Ju

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:56.110
wanted to stay in Mazhi,

00:35:58.510 --> 00:35:59.610
but I kept urging her

00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:01.410
to go to the provincial capital.

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:02.930
It made us

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:04.450
unhappy whenever we met.

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:06.880
So I came back this time

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:09.130
to help her find the truth,

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:12.550
and then we can move forward together.

00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:15.270
So I...

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:18.660
Look at her.

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:19.790
She's a mother now,

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:21.190
but still so forgetful.

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:22.160
Yes.

00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:28.510
It's late. I should go.

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:31.400
You left your key at the office?

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:35.300
Mom.

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:36.590
Why are you back?

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:37.820
You're still awake?

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:42.020
Shao, you're here too?

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.340
Shao.

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:45.360
What are you waiting for?

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.090
Come help me with these things.

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:49.690
What are you doing?

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:51.320
It's fine that you didn't tell us

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.110
the small things,

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:52.830
but something this big—

00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:54.300
you didn't tell the family either?

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:55.030
Exactly.

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.170
Have you thought this through?

00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:58.360
Let me tell you,

00:36:58.580 --> 00:36:59.580
I don't agree!

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:02.960
There's nothing you can do.

00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:04.870
We're already divorced.

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:06.400
Mom,

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:07.710
which room am I staying in?

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:08.910
There's no room for you here.

00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:10.040
Don't try to fool me.

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.110
Your new house has 3 bedrooms.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.110
One for you,

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:14.010
one for Bai Ju.

00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:14.500
Isn't

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:15.510
the remaining one mine?

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:16.400
I know it.

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:18.550
Why aren't you using

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:19.210
this air purifier

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:20.170
I bought for you?

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:21.290
It can run all day

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.340
automatically.

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:25.740
It's none of your business.

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:26.300
You...

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:27.360
Alright, alright.

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:28.530
Sit down first.

00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:30.100
Sit down and let's talk.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:31.600
One's single,

00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:32.880
one's divorced.

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:34.950
Now another one got divorced.

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:38.840
The one I worried about the most—

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:40.280
Bai Ji—

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:42.610
looks the most stable now.

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:45.030
Can't you learn from him?

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:46.400
Aren't you single too?

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:47.790
I'm a widow!

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:48.940
Is that the same?

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.040
Come on...

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:51.750
Be nice.

00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:59.150
Mom,

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:02.790
getting a divorce is my choice.

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:03.940
I didn't need

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:05.730
to ask for anyone's permission.

00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:07.830
Even if Ding Zhuoxi hadn't agreed,

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:09.150
I would still have divorced him.

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:10.590
You were the one who insisted

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:11.520
on marrying him.

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:12.880
And now you're the one

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:13.920
who had to get divorced.

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.180
That was the old me.

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:16.920
The current me is the current me.

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:17.580
And tell me,

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.120
what kind of relationship

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.310
lasts forever?

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:25.130
Of course,

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:27.340
family love is an exception.

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:29.500
I've always loved you.

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.470
The bond of blood is eternal,

00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:32.130
right?

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:33.380
Shao,

00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:35.880
Did Xi

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:36.800
cheat on you?

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:41.160
No.

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:41.860
Really?

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:46.570
Really, no.

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:50.550
These past few years,

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:51.920
we've just been

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.340
busy with our own things.

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:55.740
He's been running between here and abroad,

00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:58.210
and I've been busy with my clothing brand.

00:38:58.210 --> 00:38:59.360
Now that Dan

00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:00.660
is studying abroad,

00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:02.640
Ding wants to emigrate.

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:04.950
I don't want to go.

00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:07.770
For things like this,

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:09.670
no one should compromise.

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.570
So we just separated.

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:24.510
Wasn't that what you thought too?

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:26.510
Don't drag your sister into this.

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:28.170
Your situation is different.

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:32.650
When two people are together,

00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:34.510
you have to learn to give a little.

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:37.030
You need to compromise
when problems arise.

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:38.360
Mom.

00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:40.420
Times have changed.

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:41.610
Now it's about

00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:43.780
realizing personal value.

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:45.190
And in which area

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:46.850
have you realized your value?

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:47.860
My daughter

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:49.200
has grown up.

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:50.860
And I have a successful career.

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:52.860
Doesn't that count as having value?

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:53.280
Fine, fine.

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:53.960
You have value.

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:55.290
You have the most value.

00:39:58.380 --> 00:39:59.820
I'm doing pretty good.

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:01.940
Why is she angry?

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:05.710
Wait, Mom. What are you doing?

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:08.440
Mom.

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:10.000
If someone has to stay in a hotel,

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.330
let me go, okay?

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:15.150
What is this?

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.520
Are you planning to live under a bridge?

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:20.120
Don't cause trouble for me.

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:21.240
Don't make yourself

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:22.410
look so miserable.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:23.610
Okay?

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:25.340
Mom. Mom.

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:27.020
Aren't you going to help?

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:30.480
A scientific expedition team
is coming from Beijing.

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:31.300
Mrs. Zhang is joining the team

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:32.900
to provide medical support.

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:33.900
Hurry up and help

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:34.950
pack the suitcase.

00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:35.950
Again?

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:38.240
Are you the only one allowed

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.040
to realize your personal value?

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:46.140
Sister Bai Shao.

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:48.830
It's good that you're back.

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:50.480
No matter how good it is outside,

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:51.800
it's not as good as home.

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:52.300
Yes.

00:40:58.280 --> 00:40:59.210
Sister Bai Shao.

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:00.960
Have some butter tea.

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:02.450
You also call me Sister?

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:04.330
Do I look

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:05.090
very old now?

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:06.640
No, no. It's not that.

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:09.740
It just slipped out.

00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:12.270
Thank you.

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:18.740
Where did you buy this?

00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:20.440
I brought this back

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:22.360
from my self-driving tour in South Asia.

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.200
If you like it,

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:23.880
it's yours.

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:26.010
Look.

00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:28.010
It looks so much like you.

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:31.420
How?

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:33.760
The eyes.

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.290
They're twinkling.

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:35.990
Yes, yes.

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:37.320
Twinkling.

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:39.570
Shao,

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:41.380
go out and feed the horse, will you?

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:42.650
Go for a ride later.

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:43.410
Okay.

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:46.800
Does it look like me?

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:48.440
Yes.

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.150
Especially the nose.

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:52.800
You're asking for a beating.

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:54.240
You guys talk.

00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:20.320
I talked myself raw.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:21.990
I tried to get close to them

00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:23.120
and gave them gifts.

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:24.760
I almost emptied

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:25.760
Sangba's

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:26.680
brother-in-law's

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:27.340
warehouse.

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:29.210
I found out about 5 of them.

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:30.390
3 have moved

00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:31.660
to other provinces.

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:33.520
I've listed them all.

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:36.190
One's in Mazhi

00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:38.150
doing odd jobs. He does everything—

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:39.600
plastering, puttying,

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:41.250
even forging stamps.

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:42.310
When I found him,

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:44.000
he was cooking in the kitchen.

00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:45.450
The one

00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:47.460
with a box drawn around the name

00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:49.010
passed away two years ago.

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:50.710
What about the 6th one?

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:51.510
He's missing.

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:53.110
He's nowhere to be found.

00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:53.850
I asked a few people.

00:42:53.850 --> 00:42:54.310
[Disappeared? Wang Fumin]
[No news after 1998]

00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:55.360
They said

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.530
there's been no news of him

00:42:58.860 --> 00:42:59.850
since 1998.

00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:01.830
Then

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:03.390
pay special attention to this person.

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:04.140
Okay.
