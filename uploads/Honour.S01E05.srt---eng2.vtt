(From an old friend, Park Ju Hwan)

00:00:52.495 --> 00:00:53.495
It's been a while.

00:00:54.195 --> 00:00:55.565
I missed you, Ra Young.

00:01:07.915 --> 00:01:12.385
What's with that look? It's like you've seen a ghost.

00:01:18.225 --> 00:01:21.055
I heard the news. About your tenth anniversary.

00:01:21.125 --> 00:01:23.125
So I stopped by to congratulate you, even if I'm a little late.

00:01:24.625 --> 00:01:25.925
(From an old friend, Park Ju Hwan)

00:01:28.335 --> 00:01:31.135
Where are Shin Jae and Hyun Jin? Are they inside?

00:01:33.875 --> 00:01:35.305
They're not here right now.

00:01:36.905 --> 00:01:37.905
Really?

00:01:38.505 --> 00:01:41.145
That's a shame. I hoped to see them while I was here.

00:01:43.215 --> 00:01:45.545
Let's go out. We can grab a coffee.

(Hankuk University College of Law Newsletter)

00:01:52.025 --> 00:01:53.185
By any chance,

00:01:53.455 --> 00:01:55.724
what about the male student that went missing?

00:01:55.725 --> 00:01:57.195
Was his body ever found?

00:01:57.265 --> 00:01:58.325
You mean Ju Hwan?

00:01:59.165 --> 00:02:00.665
Ju Hwan didn't die.

00:02:01.065 --> 00:02:02.735
He was found in a hospital a few days later.

00:02:03.165 --> 00:02:05.705
A passerby found him and took him to the hospital,

00:02:06.265 --> 00:02:07.935
but I guess they couldn't identify him.

00:02:09.675 --> 00:02:13.075
If he's alive, why couldn't they find the culprit?

00:02:13.275 --> 00:02:15.275
Because Ju Hwan lost his memory.

00:02:15.575 --> 00:02:18.985
Due to a cerebral haemorrhage, he lost all memory of the accident.

00:02:19.515 --> 00:02:23.115
I hear the after-effects were severe. He took leave for rehab...

00:02:23.185 --> 00:02:27.395
and went abroad. I haven't heard from him since then.

00:02:28.795 --> 00:02:30.525
Park Ju Hwan.

Spyware?

00:02:34.765 --> 00:02:38.535
The Connect In app. They were hacking our phones.

00:02:38.735 --> 00:02:41.735
- They were watching our every move. - That's insane.

00:02:42.235 --> 00:02:44.105
Wait, how did they even know it was us?

00:02:46.175 --> 00:02:48.945
They could've just been collecting data from all users.

00:02:49.315 --> 00:02:50.315
(Trainer)

00:02:51.815 --> 00:02:54.355
Or we might have gotten flagged by one of their security filters.

(Voice detected does not match VIP 0911.)

00:02:56.755 --> 00:02:58.085
Or it could be both.

00:02:59.585 --> 00:03:02.155
Gosh, I can't believe the lengths these guys go to.

00:03:02.225 --> 00:03:05.225
You need AI technology to do this kind of real-time monitoring.

00:03:05.325 --> 00:03:07.865
But to run an AI with this level of deep learning...

00:03:08.265 --> 00:03:09.894
This is no normal trafficking ring.

00:03:09.895 --> 00:03:11.565
It's not amateurs who slapped an app...

00:03:11.635 --> 00:03:14.675
and a website together, running it as a gambling operation.

00:03:14.875 --> 00:03:16.575
These guys are total pros.

00:03:21.115 --> 00:03:22.645
Where's Attorney Yoon?

00:03:22.845 --> 00:03:27.115
She stepped out to meet a friend. The one who sent the flowers...

00:03:27.385 --> 00:03:29.715
A friend? Who?

00:03:32.325 --> 00:03:33.895
(From an old friend, Park Ju Hwan)

00:03:36.795 --> 00:03:38.525
Which way did Attorney Yoon go?

00:03:47.535 --> 00:03:48.675
So when did you get back...

00:03:50.205 --> 00:03:53.645
- to Korea? - That's ancient history.

00:03:54.115 --> 00:03:56.975
I was at a provincial office. I just moved to Seoul recently.

00:03:59.285 --> 00:04:00.555
I thought I'd say hello,

00:04:02.385 --> 00:04:03.685
so I just dropped by for a minute.

00:04:06.255 --> 00:04:07.755
(Park Je Yeol, Seoul Mujin Regional Prosecutors' Office)

00:04:07.995 --> 00:04:10.095
You changed your name?

00:04:10.155 --> 00:04:11.864
You know how it is.

00:04:11.865 --> 00:04:14.465
Victims often change their names after an accident.

00:04:14.795 --> 00:04:17.205
Because they want to put it behind them.

00:04:17.705 --> 00:04:19.465
I guess that's why I became a prosecutor.

00:04:19.905 --> 00:04:24.345
Because I know all too well that until the culprit is caught,

00:04:25.245 --> 00:04:27.615
the victim can never escape their own personal hell.

00:04:29.245 --> 00:04:31.745
A victim?

00:04:31.815 --> 00:04:35.055
My head was crushed in. I wasn't the perpetrator, was I?

00:04:43.225 --> 00:04:44.625
I'm sorry about what happened.

00:04:44.925 --> 00:04:49.035
That they never caught the culprit, and that you lost your memory.

00:05:00.745 --> 00:05:04.045
Considering you were so sorry, you had no problem dumping me.

00:05:04.715 --> 00:05:07.685
You never even visited me in the hospital once after that.

00:05:07.915 --> 00:05:11.555
And on top of all that, you broke up with me over a text.

00:05:11.725 --> 00:05:14.895
Can you imagine how hurt I was?

00:05:15.395 --> 00:05:17.465
But I get it.

00:05:19.865 --> 00:05:21.295
Complications from a cerebral haemorrhage...

00:05:22.265 --> 00:05:24.835
I'm still suffering from them.

00:05:25.305 --> 00:05:29.975
I guess you were just too pretty to stick by a sick boyfriend.

00:05:30.235 --> 00:05:31.245
But of course,

00:05:33.175 --> 00:05:34.575
you still are...

00:05:36.475 --> 00:05:37.645
just as beautiful.

00:05:41.855 --> 00:05:44.625
And look what we have here. Another welcome face.

00:05:53.565 --> 00:05:55.965
How could I ignore a friend I've missed so dearly?

00:05:56.265 --> 00:05:57.465
That wouldn't be right.

00:05:58.765 --> 00:06:00.065
It's hot.

00:06:04.605 --> 00:06:05.805
It's been a while.

00:06:06.075 --> 00:06:09.375
It has. What's it been, 20 years?

00:06:09.415 --> 00:06:12.115
I heard you moved abroad, so I didn't think I'd see you again.

00:06:12.445 --> 00:06:15.055
But I guess life is full of surprises.

00:06:17.115 --> 00:06:19.985
Why's that? Was there a reason...

00:06:20.325 --> 00:06:25.095
- you didn't want to see me again? - Because I've always hated you.

00:06:25.665 --> 00:06:29.465
I was against it from the start, when Ra Young started dating you.

00:06:37.305 --> 00:06:39.305
(Park Je Yeol, Seoul Mujin Regional Prosecutors' Office)

00:06:39.375 --> 00:06:41.115
Goodness, you became a prosecutor?

00:06:41.975 --> 00:06:43.615
And you changed your name.

00:06:44.345 --> 00:06:48.415
What, did you commit a crime? That's usually what ex-cons do.

00:06:48.655 --> 00:06:51.585
- Your name's still the same. - That's because...

00:06:52.325 --> 00:06:54.455
I have nothing to be ashamed of.

00:06:54.925 --> 00:06:58.495
That's a relief. I'd hate to see a friend as a suspect.

00:07:00.225 --> 00:07:01.735
Let's wrap up this little reunion.

00:07:02.135 --> 00:07:05.705
- We'll be seeing each other again. - We will?

00:07:06.605 --> 00:07:09.405
I'm planning to reinvestigate what happened back then.

00:07:10.105 --> 00:07:13.875
And since it happened so long ago, I might need all of your help.

00:07:15.745 --> 00:07:16.775
See you around.

00:07:29.955 --> 00:07:31.065
Ra Young.

00:07:31.895 --> 00:07:33.025
Ra Young.

00:07:38.465 --> 00:07:39.565
Ra Young.

00:07:41.175 --> 00:07:42.275
Ra Young.

00:07:47.005 --> 00:07:48.815
Yoon Ra Young!

00:07:49.715 --> 00:07:52.185
Look at me.

00:07:53.785 --> 00:07:54.815
It's okay.

00:07:55.715 --> 00:07:57.085
Okay, breathe.

00:07:57.585 --> 00:07:58.685
Again.

00:08:02.055 --> 00:08:03.125
Good.

00:08:04.195 --> 00:08:05.195
One more time.

00:08:07.795 --> 00:08:08.995
Good.

00:08:10.595 --> 00:08:14.075
That jerk. How dare he come here?

00:08:19.145 --> 00:08:20.775
(Found the Connect In app. Call me before you come.)

00:08:23.245 --> 00:08:26.445
Is the pain that bad? Should I ask for more painkillers?

00:08:29.285 --> 00:08:30.585
It's Brahms.

00:08:31.955 --> 00:08:33.955
Brahms and Dvorak.

00:08:34.255 --> 00:08:37.595
Mahler, Bruckner, Shostakovich.

00:08:38.365 --> 00:08:42.695
In painting, Baroque. Caravaggio, Rubens, and van Dyck.

00:08:43.065 --> 00:08:46.505
I've read everything by Stendhal and Flaubert.

00:08:46.705 --> 00:08:50.805
And I loved John Steinbeck, Emile Zola, and Victor Hugo.

00:08:51.345 --> 00:08:55.345
For wine, Burgundy. On special occasions, Domaine Leroy.

00:08:55.645 --> 00:08:58.145
For whiskey, a Speyside single malt.

00:08:59.085 --> 00:09:00.385
You have excellent taste.

00:09:01.185 --> 00:09:02.915
You taught me everything.

00:09:03.415 --> 00:09:05.355
Everything I love.

00:09:07.155 --> 00:09:10.555
If I take away everything I learned from you,

00:09:11.695 --> 00:09:13.465
what would even be left of me?

00:09:18.135 --> 00:09:20.205
I found the Connect In app.

00:09:20.735 --> 00:09:22.135
On your phone.

00:09:40.185 --> 00:09:42.225
Don't tell me you're going to deny it.

00:09:44.865 --> 00:09:46.195
I'm not sure.

00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:49.995
I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about.

00:09:51.405 --> 00:09:54.105
I also found proof. On your phone.

00:09:54.175 --> 00:09:57.605
And what exactly is this "proof" you're talking about?

00:09:57.975 --> 00:09:59.105
Why don't you check again?

00:10:01.315 --> 00:10:03.845
You seem to have caused this scene over it,

00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:05.345
but that's a shame.

00:10:05.915 --> 00:10:07.045
And another thing.

00:10:07.585 --> 00:10:10.115
Even if what you're claiming is true,

00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:12.685
what's the big deal?

00:10:13.555 --> 00:10:14.555
What did you just say?

00:10:14.855 --> 00:10:18.495
You need to grow up, Shin Jae. Before you leap without looking,

00:10:18.565 --> 00:10:20.425
you need to weigh the consequences.

00:10:22.295 --> 00:10:24.435
What you stand to gain from this...

00:10:25.305 --> 00:10:26.735
and what you stand to lose.

00:10:28.305 --> 00:10:32.175
I can't believe what I'm hearing. Was that a threat?

00:10:34.145 --> 00:10:36.745
Either way, you only have one choice.

00:10:37.485 --> 00:10:39.145
Join me, or...

00:10:39.585 --> 00:10:42.115
spend the rest of your life being pushed around by your mother.

00:10:43.385 --> 00:10:46.855
Think it over if you want to protect L and J.

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:49.425
There's no point in discussing this further.

00:10:50.295 --> 00:10:51.495
Leave.

00:11:04.375 --> 00:11:06.305
How could you do this?

00:11:07.675 --> 00:11:09.875
I should be asking you the same thing.

00:11:10.275 --> 00:11:12.045
Did I teach you to be like this?

00:11:12.445 --> 00:11:14.855
To invade someone's privacy like this?

00:11:41.045 --> 00:11:43.214
What's going on? Why is the app gone?

00:11:43.215 --> 00:11:46.745
We'll talk about that later. A bombshell just dropped.

00:11:48.215 --> 00:11:49.285
Park Ju Hwan.

00:11:49.685 --> 00:11:52.455
What are you talking about? Park Ju Hwan?

00:11:52.625 --> 00:11:56.995
He came to the office. And get this. That jerk is a prosecutor now.

00:11:57.695 --> 00:11:58.895
How's Ra Young?

00:12:09.535 --> 00:12:12.245
I'm fine. I'm not in my 20s anymore.

00:12:13.045 --> 00:12:15.775
I tell our clients that everything will be okay,

00:12:15.875 --> 00:12:17.615
so I can't afford to fall apart, can I?

00:12:21.315 --> 00:12:24.115
I'm going to eat something spicy. Something mind-numbingly spicy.

00:12:24.255 --> 00:12:25.785
That's what we need today.

00:12:40.865 --> 00:12:42.975
All right, let's hurry. I'm starving.

00:12:43.475 --> 00:12:45.175
So what do you need us to do?

00:12:55.455 --> 00:12:57.155
When did he get back to Korea?

00:12:57.555 --> 00:12:58.985
Seems like a while ago.

00:13:00.425 --> 00:13:02.555
We should've kept better tabs on him.

00:13:02.825 --> 00:13:04.625
Before he could just pop up like this.

00:13:04.965 --> 00:13:08.365
How were we to know he'd changed his name?

00:13:09.365 --> 00:13:10.765
So how did he seem?

00:13:11.105 --> 00:13:12.765
Did it look like he's really gotten his memory back?

00:13:13.535 --> 00:13:14.775
It's hard to say.

00:13:15.435 --> 00:13:19.004
I'm not sure he's testing the waters, saying he'll reinvestigate,

00:13:19.005 --> 00:13:20.075
or if he remembers something.

00:13:25.985 --> 00:13:29.855
I almost hope he hasn't gotten his memory back.

00:13:30.755 --> 00:13:34.395
If he's acting that brazen knowing what he did to me,

00:13:35.025 --> 00:13:36.025
it's just too...

00:13:37.425 --> 00:13:38.595
agonizing for me.

00:13:39.565 --> 00:13:40.925
I could never forgive him.

Attorney Yoon?

Min Seo.

00:14:05.255 --> 00:14:06.855
Something I ate isn't sitting right.

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:08.625
I'm okay.

00:14:09.655 --> 00:14:11.495

00:14:41.895 --> 00:14:44.055
- Seung Jin. - Yes?

00:14:44.995 --> 00:14:47.835
Do you recognise this person?

00:14:50.295 --> 00:14:53.935
Hey, he looks really familiar. What?

00:14:55.035 --> 00:14:56.735
Isn't this Prosecutor Park Je Yeol?

00:14:56.835 --> 00:14:59.205
Right? It's him, isn't it?

00:14:59.375 --> 00:15:01.375
Yes, I think you're right.

00:15:01.715 --> 00:15:03.615
Looks like he was a classmate of your wife.

00:15:04.115 --> 00:15:07.645
Then again, the cream of the crop all stick together.

00:15:11.155 --> 00:15:12.625
Why would he change his name?

00:15:13.555 --> 00:15:17.095
Hey, you'd better get to the Chief. He'll flip out if you're late.

00:15:17.395 --> 00:15:18.665
- All right. I'll be right back. - Okay.

00:15:19.765 --> 00:15:21.335

The Samyang-dong serial theft case...

You can handle one more file then, right?

00:15:31.745 --> 00:15:34.945
It's a 20-year-old case. I need you to handle it with care.

- Prosecutor Park Je Yeol? - Yes, he is.

Doesn't something seem off?

00:16:05.305 --> 00:16:08.315
So that jerk Park Ju Hwan was the prosecutor on Yoo Jeong's case?

00:16:08.375 --> 00:16:10.575
And on top of that, he had the case reassigned to him.

00:16:10.815 --> 00:16:14.185
- So he took her case on purpose? - Most likely.

00:16:14.685 --> 00:16:16.855
But you know what's even stranger?

00:16:17.755 --> 00:16:20.825
Park Ju Hwan had met Jo Yoo Jeong a year ago.

00:16:20.885 --> 00:16:22.255
She was a suspect in an aggravated theft case.

00:16:22.825 --> 00:16:24.125
You think this is a coincidence?

00:16:24.195 --> 00:16:27.295
There's one way to find out. I'll go meet Yoo Jeong's sister.

00:16:30.335 --> 00:16:32.905
Yoo Jeong wasn't actually trying to steal it.

00:16:33.505 --> 00:16:35.305
At the shop where she worked part-time,

00:16:35.705 --> 00:16:37.905
she accidentally spilled a drink on a customer's bag.

00:16:38.305 --> 00:16:40.045
She must have panicked.

00:16:40.305 --> 00:16:44.815
So she and a friend from work took the bag to try and clean it.

00:16:44.885 --> 00:16:46.515
But they ended up getting accused of theft.

00:16:47.345 --> 00:16:50.355
The customer refused to settle, so we were really worried,

00:16:50.515 --> 00:16:53.685
but luckily, the prosecutor decided to suspend the indictment.

00:16:53.955 --> 00:16:56.395
For aggravated theft, with no settlement,

00:16:56.695 --> 00:16:57.965
he just suspended the indictment?

00:17:01.265 --> 00:17:02.595
Min Seo, have you, by any chance,

00:17:02.935 --> 00:17:05.235
ever met a prosecutor named Park Je Yeol?

00:17:05.405 --> 00:17:07.435
No, I've never met him.

00:17:08.435 --> 00:17:12.605
Min Seo, how did you end up working for Connect?

00:17:12.945 --> 00:17:14.205
You know Lee Seon Hwa, right?

00:17:14.775 --> 00:17:17.445
- It was because of her. - Lee Seon Hwa?

00:17:17.945 --> 00:17:20.385
She took out a loan in my name,

00:17:20.445 --> 00:17:22.555
and she said part of it was transferred to them.

00:17:22.685 --> 00:17:25.685
I was told I had to work at Connect to pay it off.

00:17:49.445 --> 00:17:50.675
You have no idea where?

00:17:50.745 --> 00:17:53.615
Kidding? If I knew, I'd have gone after her. She ripped me off too.

00:17:53.785 --> 00:17:56.985
That witch would squeeze blood from a stone.

00:17:58.555 --> 00:18:01.595
This is her stuff. I was hoping I'd find something valuable,

00:18:01.655 --> 00:18:03.655
but it's all just junk. Gosh.

00:18:09.895 --> 00:18:11.435
It's a trial summons.

00:18:11.505 --> 00:18:15.604
That's probably why she ran. She got her indictment suspended last time,

00:18:15.605 --> 00:18:17.805
- but she must've been caught again. - A suspended indictment?

00:18:17.835 --> 00:18:21.075
Yes, that junkie. She'll actually do time for this, right?

00:18:21.145 --> 00:18:22.275
It's her fourth offence now.

00:18:22.615 --> 00:18:24.685
- Darn! My money. - Wait.

00:18:25.085 --> 00:18:26.715
She was a three-time offender,

00:18:26.785 --> 00:18:28.155
and she still got a suspended indictment?

00:18:28.415 --> 00:18:31.255
You said you'd kill them next time, so that's a threat.

00:18:31.985 --> 00:18:34.925
And since you were holding a stick with nails in it, it's "aggravated."

00:18:38.425 --> 00:18:40.725
While you're serving seven years for aggravated threats,

00:18:41.365 --> 00:18:43.595
have you decided which orphanage to send your little brother to?

00:18:44.935 --> 00:18:49.005
I did it because I was so angry they bullied my little brother.

00:18:50.535 --> 00:18:54.675
Sir, please let me off the hook just this once.

00:18:57.445 --> 00:18:59.185
Let you off the hook?

00:19:02.585 --> 00:19:03.715
Shall I?

00:19:05.125 --> 00:19:06.325
You really want me to do that?

00:19:06.955 --> 00:19:09.025
Yes, please.

00:19:12.865 --> 00:19:14.065
All right, then. Maybe I will.

00:19:14.795 --> 00:19:15.795

No.

00:19:32.685 --> 00:19:36.185
Through Prosecutor Park Je Yeol, they received suspended indictments,

00:19:36.315 --> 00:19:38.025
and were then exploited by Connect.

00:19:38.685 --> 00:19:40.725
In Lee Seon Hwa's case, Min Seo had to take her place.

00:19:41.425 --> 00:19:43.955
It's clear that some of the victims...

00:19:44.025 --> 00:19:46.095
were likely supplied to the app...

00:19:46.165 --> 00:19:47.165
through Park Je Yeol.

00:19:47.225 --> 00:19:48.295
By using his authority to indict people.

00:19:50.635 --> 00:19:52.965
So Park Je Yeol is part of Connect?

00:19:57.435 --> 00:19:59.445
Even a prosecutor is part of this whole scheme?

00:19:59.745 --> 00:20:02.475
If that's true, then all the pieces fall into place.

00:20:03.215 --> 00:20:05.815
Including who's been using our pasts to attack us all this time.

00:20:06.145 --> 00:20:08.185
But right now, the only evidence we have...

00:20:08.515 --> 00:20:09.955
is all circumstantial.

00:20:11.015 --> 00:20:13.585
If only that darn app hadn't been taken down...

00:20:15.855 --> 00:20:16.955
So, have you decided?

00:20:17.795 --> 00:20:19.725
What you're going to do about Attorney Kwon?

00:20:21.635 --> 00:20:23.435
What's there to decide?

00:20:24.165 --> 00:20:26.835

- It's been a while. - I heard you came looking for me,

00:21:45.645 --> 00:21:47.015
so I thought we should at least say hello.

00:21:48.955 --> 00:21:50.355
How did you find me here?

Around here, if I put my mind to it, there isn't much I can't find out.

You're looking good.

00:21:59.495 --> 00:22:00.495
I'm great.

00:22:01.025 --> 00:22:04.465
I endure the searing pain in my right arm several times a day,

00:22:04.835 --> 00:22:08.335
and I have to choke down a fistful of painkillers every day,

00:22:09.405 --> 00:22:10.505
but I'm doing just great.

00:22:11.335 --> 00:22:12.345
So,

00:22:12.645 --> 00:22:14.345
are you trying to get your revenge now?

00:22:15.015 --> 00:22:18.785
Why? You're only scared now?

00:22:21.345 --> 00:22:23.915
- So you've regained your memory. - Is that all?

00:22:24.585 --> 00:22:25.885
I also got my hands on the evidence.

00:22:37.565 --> 00:22:39.535
The DNA sample you guys tried to sneak out...

00:22:40.465 --> 00:22:44.735
It just so happens to match the suspect's DNA from the scene.

00:22:49.315 --> 00:22:50.945
Then I guess you also remember...

what you did to Ra Young that night.

00:22:58.255 --> 00:23:01.595

It's not like you can prove it, anyway.

They say you're shrill and exhausting.

If I just add a little fuel to that fire,

Please forgive me, ma'am. I was foolish.

00:25:36.345 --> 00:25:37.375
I was wrong.

00:25:39.415 --> 00:25:40.845
- Please forgive me. - Please forgive me.

00:25:53.625 --> 00:25:55.035
Back when we were young,

00:25:55.495 --> 00:25:58.195
you used to say you were sick of only attending law lectures,

00:25:58.765 --> 00:26:01.605
so we used to sneak into classes in other departments.

00:26:02.875 --> 00:26:03.975
Remember that?

00:26:04.535 --> 00:26:05.545
Yes.

00:26:06.975 --> 00:26:10.675
Wasn't it an Intro to Literature class we sat in on?

00:26:13.015 --> 00:26:17.485
I really disliked King Lear, Hamlet, and Macbeth.

00:26:20.325 --> 00:26:23.795
The kings all lose their thrones. So foolishly.

00:26:29.995 --> 00:26:31.065
Jung Hyeon.

00:26:31.635 --> 00:26:33.705
When a child is acting up, you're supposed to correct them.

00:26:34.005 --> 00:26:35.805
Not play along with them.

00:26:42.545 --> 00:26:43.745
I have no excuse.

00:26:45.515 --> 00:26:46.515
That's right.

00:26:47.985 --> 00:26:50.055
You shouldn't have one.

00:26:51.255 --> 00:26:52.485
I knew it.

00:26:53.355 --> 00:26:55.025
The reason Park Je Yeol showed up.

00:26:57.155 --> 00:27:00.525
He's using our past to stop us from pursuing Connect.

00:27:02.835 --> 00:27:04.395
But what if Park Je Yeol...

00:27:05.105 --> 00:27:06.305
really goes public with it?

00:27:07.965 --> 00:27:09.775
Hyun Jin would be in the most danger.

00:27:12.305 --> 00:27:14.975
But we can't just surrender.

00:27:15.715 --> 00:27:17.115
Especially not to that jerk.

00:27:17.515 --> 00:27:20.715
- Worst-case scenario, you could... - Get arrested?

00:27:22.755 --> 00:27:26.325
You think the lawyers here would just stand by and let that happen?

00:27:27.725 --> 00:27:30.195
And we would probably...

00:27:31.055 --> 00:27:32.595
lose everything.

00:27:34.365 --> 00:27:35.935
Everything we've worked so hard to build.

00:27:39.435 --> 00:27:41.665
But if we're prepared to fight this to the very end,

00:27:41.735 --> 00:27:44.235
your opinion is what matters most to Hyun Jin and me.

00:27:44.735 --> 00:27:47.405
Can you handle what's coming?

00:27:53.015 --> 00:27:56.055
About that DNA sample from before, the one Seon Kyu took.

00:27:56.355 --> 00:27:57.885
It ended up in Park Je Yeol's hands.

00:27:58.855 --> 00:28:02.095
- What are you talking about? - So, does that ring any bells?

00:28:03.455 --> 00:28:06.295
But do you even know who my husband is?

00:28:06.765 --> 00:28:08.065
He's a sitting prosecutor.

00:28:25.115 --> 00:28:26.115
Ju Hwan.

00:28:27.115 --> 00:28:28.115
Park Ju Hwan.

00:28:30.685 --> 00:28:32.525
Ju Hwan, I've been looking all over for you.

00:28:32.785 --> 00:28:35.025
I told you not to smile at other guys.

00:28:35.955 --> 00:28:39.095
I'm sorry. Let's go. Everyone's waiting.

00:28:40.225 --> 00:28:41.725
You don't love me at all.

00:28:42.965 --> 00:28:44.235
You just say you do.

00:28:45.265 --> 00:28:46.805
Then what do you want me to do?

00:28:47.065 --> 00:28:48.265
What do I have to do to make you believe me?

00:28:49.535 --> 00:28:50.605
Prove it.

00:28:51.435 --> 00:28:52.505
Are you crazy?

00:28:55.215 --> 00:28:56.815
Let go. Don't!

00:29:01.215 --> 00:29:02.215
No!

00:29:35.815 --> 00:29:38.855
Why give me the cold shoulder just because you got a few wrong?

00:29:39.425 --> 00:29:41.425
Because I changed my scantron answer and got it wrong!

00:29:41.995 --> 00:29:43.095
This is so frustrating.

00:29:43.795 --> 00:29:45.795
If you keep that up, you're going to regret it.

00:29:46.495 --> 00:29:47.495
Here.

00:29:48.965 --> 00:29:50.165
(Super concert!)

00:29:51.365 --> 00:29:54.035
No way! Dad, how did you get these?

00:29:54.405 --> 00:29:56.175
What do you mean? I bought them, of course.

00:29:56.475 --> 00:29:59.375
I'm practically an expert at nabbing tickets now.

00:30:00.075 --> 00:30:01.275
Thanks, Dad.

00:30:07.445 --> 00:30:10.885
- Dad, come on. Mom's waiting. - Right, let's go in.

00:30:41.785 --> 00:30:42.855
(Family Registry)

00:30:42.915 --> 00:30:44.415
(Hong Yeon Hui, Spouse: Park Je Yeol, Child: Park Sang A)

00:30:54.465 --> 00:30:57.095
- Having indigestion? - No, it's my lower abdomen.

00:30:59.535 --> 00:31:02.105
Are you sure it's not cramps? Want some painkillers?

00:31:12.515 --> 00:31:13.545
What's this?

00:31:16.815 --> 00:31:17.985
What do you think you're doing?

00:31:20.185 --> 00:31:21.425
Well...

00:31:22.755 --> 00:31:25.525
- Orders came from above... - What orders?

00:31:33.265 --> 00:31:34.835
(Managing Partner Kang Shin Jae)

00:31:36.935 --> 00:31:39.475
I'm Kwon Jung Hyeon, the new head of LnJ.

00:31:40.175 --> 00:31:41.245
I look forward to working with you all.

00:31:42.345 --> 00:31:43.375
(Managing Partner Kwon Jung Hyeon)

00:31:46.585 --> 00:31:48.115
What do you think you're doing?

00:31:48.485 --> 00:31:51.115
Consider this my response to your message.

00:31:51.815 --> 00:31:53.925
You shouldn't have one.

00:31:54.525 --> 00:31:58.225
- I trust you're ready to pay. - About Shin Jae...

00:32:00.725 --> 00:32:02.665
I will take responsibility and send her to Haeil.

00:32:04.595 --> 00:32:06.305
I'll resign from all my positions.

00:32:06.805 --> 00:32:08.265
Just send me to LnJ.

00:32:11.005 --> 00:32:12.905
You have to be able to weather a storm like this.

00:32:14.205 --> 00:32:15.915
Drop all your current cases.

00:32:16.415 --> 00:32:21.085
I'm changing the firm's direction. Women aren't the only vulnerable.

00:32:22.985 --> 00:32:24.885
You can't just do this out of the blue.

00:32:25.215 --> 00:32:26.355
We've been using our own free time to take...

00:32:26.425 --> 00:32:29.655
a ton of pro bono cases. If you make us drop them all...

00:32:29.725 --> 00:32:31.955
I also saw some cases that were getting bad press.

00:32:32.925 --> 00:32:36.495
Why should your volunteer work tarnish the firm's name?

00:32:38.435 --> 00:32:41.965
Who do you all think signs your paychecks?

00:32:42.505 --> 00:32:45.475
From now on, no cases or assignments without my approval.

00:32:46.045 --> 00:32:47.775
When the steering committee meets next year,

00:32:48.205 --> 00:32:50.515
I don't want to be torn apart for being an incompetent leader.

00:32:51.475 --> 00:32:52.845
Like you were, Shin Jae.

00:32:53.385 --> 00:32:55.345
This is all because of Connect, isn't it?

00:32:55.755 --> 00:32:57.685
You're trying to stop us from exposing what Connect did.

00:32:58.115 --> 00:33:00.325
- Am I wrong? - Well...

00:33:00.655 --> 00:33:03.995
I don't know what you mean, but what I do know is...

00:33:04.155 --> 00:33:07.925
that the Jo Yoo Jeong case is closed due to her suicide.

00:33:08.425 --> 00:33:12.735
This is no playground to waste time writing some ridiculous fantasy.

00:33:24.545 --> 00:33:26.345
The person you are calling is unavailable...

00:33:26.445 --> 00:33:28.315

(Lee Seon Hwa)

00:33:36.495 --> 00:33:38.195
I know everything you did to me.

00:33:38.725 --> 00:33:39.765
Call me.

00:35:05.045 --> 00:35:06.815
You've been giving me a lot to worry about lately.

00:35:08.645 --> 00:35:09.655
Mark my words.

00:35:10.085 --> 00:35:12.425
If you keep acting up, Yoon Ra Young is going to get hurt.

00:36:22.795 --> 00:36:23.795
Min Seo.

00:36:47.015 --> 00:36:48.315
I'm at the hotel.

00:36:49.085 --> 00:36:50.085
Where are you?

00:36:50.755 --> 00:36:54.125
In the government's national pilot smart city project,

00:36:54.325 --> 00:36:56.995
The Prime is being mentioned as the most promising candidate.

00:36:57.755 --> 00:37:00.424
That predictive defence system you mentioned...

00:37:00.425 --> 00:37:01.624
- would ultimately... - You're here.

00:37:01.625 --> 00:37:03.165
We need to talk.

00:37:03.235 --> 00:37:06.205
We need to talk about Attorney Kwon. How could you, without telling me?

00:37:06.235 --> 00:37:07.235
That would be unavoidable.

00:37:07.305 --> 00:37:09.105
You also went behind my back,

00:37:09.275 --> 00:37:10.935
scheming something interesting of your own.

00:37:11.005 --> 00:37:12.005
That concern was our starting point.

00:37:12.445 --> 00:37:16.215
Technology shouldn't surveil people. It should protect them.

00:37:16.445 --> 00:37:19.245
Our system doesn't track who is dangerous.

00:37:19.385 --> 00:37:22.385
It simply determines which situations are dangerous.

00:37:22.855 --> 00:37:26.785
All data from the smart city project will be encrypted using blockchain.

00:37:26.985 --> 00:37:29.855
No identifiable personal information will be stored,

00:37:30.325 --> 00:37:34.795
and it's designed so that no admin can access the source data.

00:37:35.625 --> 00:37:37.535
Why are the reporters taking our picture?

00:37:38.035 --> 00:37:40.264
- Didn't you see the news? - What news?

00:37:40.265 --> 00:37:42.835
Redesigning the relationship...

00:37:43.505 --> 00:37:46.545
Corruption by the powerful, a system free from human prejudice...

00:37:46.605 --> 00:37:48.105

For even the most vulnerable...

00:37:51.815 --> 00:37:53.285
Was this your doing?

00:37:53.385 --> 00:37:55.885
I've let you off the leash for too long.

00:37:56.255 --> 00:37:58.255
- So I've learned my lesson. - Our technology will be the tool...

00:37:58.315 --> 00:37:59.325
And him?

00:37:59.385 --> 00:38:01.385
Is he okay with articles like this?

00:38:01.585 --> 00:38:05.025
That is the one and only goal The Prime aims to achieve.

(The Prime: Technology, Setting a New Standard)

00:38:08.595 --> 00:38:11.035
Quiet. People are watching.

00:38:13.135 --> 00:38:16.475
Excuse me, sir, but a report about your engagement just came out.

00:38:16.775 --> 00:38:18.305
Is there any truth to the article?

00:38:19.645 --> 00:38:20.845
The engagement rumour...

00:38:21.975 --> 00:38:23.075
is not true.

00:38:25.475 --> 00:38:28.585
However, it is true that I have feelings for her.

(The Prime: Technology, Setting a New Standard)

00:38:45.065 --> 00:38:46.335
Pardon the intrusion.

This is the only place we can talk without being seen.

What do you think you're doing?

00:38:51.305 --> 00:38:52.375
What do you mean?

00:38:52.975 --> 00:38:57.175
Why are you siding with my mother? And making things up, no less.

00:38:57.245 --> 00:38:58.475
I wasn't lying.

00:38:59.885 --> 00:39:02.285
I corrected the engagement rumour,

00:39:03.055 --> 00:39:05.515
and as for my feelings for you, Attorney Kang...

00:39:06.525 --> 00:39:07.555
That part is true.

00:39:09.755 --> 00:39:13.065
Do you realise we've only met a handful of times?

00:39:13.195 --> 00:39:14.365
Even before we ever met.

00:39:14.825 --> 00:39:16.265
I've been interested from the very beginning.

00:39:17.695 --> 00:39:19.535
What deal did you make with my mother?

00:39:19.835 --> 00:39:21.535
Or what do you want from me?

00:39:23.375 --> 00:39:25.375
Is that always how you approach people?

00:39:25.675 --> 00:39:27.505
As a transaction, not a relationship.

00:39:27.675 --> 00:39:29.245
Profit over trust.

00:39:29.675 --> 00:39:30.845
And what's wrong with that?

00:39:31.515 --> 00:39:35.015
I happen to think we could be a great team.

00:39:35.315 --> 00:39:37.515
- And not as business partners. - What's that supposed to mean?

00:39:37.585 --> 00:39:39.084
Try a different perspective.

00:39:39.085 --> 00:39:40.685
I'm not an enemy siding with your mother.

00:39:41.025 --> 00:39:44.255
I could be an ally who empowers you, Attorney Kang.

00:39:44.625 --> 00:39:46.695
Why would you choose me over my mother?

00:39:48.565 --> 00:39:50.265
Because the one I find impressive...

00:39:51.365 --> 00:39:52.565
is you, Attorney Kang.

00:39:53.165 --> 00:39:54.335
Not CEO Seong.

00:39:57.735 --> 00:39:58.835
Oh, right.

00:39:59.875 --> 00:40:02.505
I won't bother issuing a retraction for that engagement story.

00:40:03.075 --> 00:40:04.215
You never know, it might just come true.

00:40:09.015 --> 00:40:10.015
See you around.

00:40:27.765 --> 00:40:28.765
Here. Drink this.

00:40:42.415 --> 00:40:46.025
I was so hungry, so I stole my neighbour's milk.

00:40:48.555 --> 00:40:49.555
When I was six.

00:40:50.595 --> 00:40:51.925
I hadn't eaten in three days.

00:40:54.625 --> 00:40:56.935
As punishment, I was locked out on the balcony for two days.

00:40:59.165 --> 00:41:00.235
In just my underwear.

00:41:03.675 --> 00:41:04.875
And it was January.

00:41:07.105 --> 00:41:08.375
When I was in elementary school,

00:41:09.315 --> 00:41:11.915
I ran an errand and messed up the change.

00:41:14.115 --> 00:41:17.055
And my entire body became black with bruises.

00:41:18.255 --> 00:41:19.985
My parents were always like that.

00:41:20.885 --> 00:41:22.995
They said if you do something bad, you get punished.

00:41:24.725 --> 00:41:26.495
Is it because I'm a bad person...

00:41:28.465 --> 00:41:30.265
that this is happening to me?

00:41:36.275 --> 00:41:37.275
Min Seo.

00:41:38.675 --> 00:41:42.075
Could you ever stab someone with a knife?

00:41:45.115 --> 00:41:46.115
You couldn't, could you?

00:41:47.085 --> 00:41:49.285
Then why would you do that to yourself?

00:41:53.355 --> 00:41:54.555
I used to do that to myself too.

00:41:55.455 --> 00:41:59.365
"Why did I go there? Why couldn't I see who he truly was?"

00:42:00.765 --> 00:42:05.035
"Something this awful happened to me because I was naive and stupid."

00:42:05.535 --> 00:42:08.305
The kind of cruel blame I would never put on anyone else,

00:42:09.035 --> 00:42:11.605
I'd turn it on myself hundreds, even thousands of times.

00:42:14.745 --> 00:42:16.045
And do you know why?

00:42:18.675 --> 00:42:20.945
Because I was my own easiest target.

00:42:23.115 --> 00:42:25.255
I should've been mad at my tormentor, at this unjust world.

00:42:26.255 --> 00:42:28.625
But I didn't have the courage to fight back,

00:42:29.225 --> 00:42:30.355
so I was just taking it out...

00:42:31.455 --> 00:42:32.695
on someone weak.

00:42:33.365 --> 00:42:34.925
Myself, the easiest person...

00:42:36.235 --> 00:42:37.235
for me to hurt.

00:42:39.565 --> 00:42:40.605
Blaming yourself...

00:42:41.835 --> 00:42:44.075
is the most convenient way...

00:42:45.005 --> 00:42:46.775
to be a coward. That's what I realised.

00:42:51.545 --> 00:42:52.545
I...

00:42:53.745 --> 00:42:57.455
want you to break up with yesterday, Min Seo.

00:42:58.155 --> 00:43:01.225
And I want you to start showing some respect...

00:43:01.785 --> 00:43:03.095
to yourself.

00:43:08.295 --> 00:43:09.995
Someone from Connect came to see me.

00:43:11.095 --> 00:43:15.205
They said if I keep helping LnJ, they're going to come after you.

00:43:16.075 --> 00:43:18.275
- From now on, you must never... - When things like this happen,

00:43:19.105 --> 00:43:20.445
it feels like confirmation...

00:43:20.975 --> 00:43:21.975
of who I really am.

00:43:23.115 --> 00:43:25.815
That I can never be normal like everyone else.

00:43:26.385 --> 00:43:29.385
And that I'll never be able to escape it.

00:43:32.415 --> 00:43:34.585
I don't want much. I just...

00:43:36.295 --> 00:43:38.255
want to get back the things I've lost.

00:43:40.495 --> 00:43:41.765
Can I get it all back?

00:43:42.935 --> 00:43:44.495
Even after I've ruined everything?

00:43:56.545 --> 00:43:57.545
You're up?

00:43:58.845 --> 00:44:01.045
I figured a proper meal would be better for breakfast.

00:44:01.385 --> 00:44:02.715
How are you feeling? Are you okay?

00:44:03.755 --> 00:44:04.785
Yes.

00:44:06.185 --> 00:44:07.785
Did you make all this just for me?

00:44:08.255 --> 00:44:09.655
You said you don't eat breakfast.

00:44:10.955 --> 00:44:11.955
Have a seat.

00:44:23.075 --> 00:44:25.305
A while back, when I was having a hard time,

00:44:26.605 --> 00:44:31.245
I couldn't eat anything for a while. I couldn't get a single bite down.

00:44:32.615 --> 00:44:36.555
While I wasn't eating, my friends refused to eat too.

00:44:37.285 --> 00:44:39.725
For them, I forced down one bite, then another.

00:44:40.425 --> 00:44:42.855
And slowly, I started to get up,

00:44:43.695 --> 00:44:45.625
to walk, and even go outside again.

00:44:48.265 --> 00:44:49.465
That's when I realised.

00:44:49.835 --> 00:44:51.265
Surviving isn't all that complicated.

00:44:51.765 --> 00:44:53.165
I felt like I was going to die,

00:44:53.435 --> 00:44:55.265
but once I ate, I found myself able to live again.

00:44:56.065 --> 00:44:58.975
To live, you have to eat. And to save someone,

00:44:59.405 --> 00:45:00.545
you have to feed them.

00:45:06.145 --> 00:45:07.515
I'm not going to lie to you.

00:45:08.645 --> 00:45:09.655
In the end,

00:45:10.285 --> 00:45:12.385
I never fully recovered.

00:45:13.755 --> 00:45:17.925
Some wounds heal without a trace, but others...

00:45:19.225 --> 00:45:20.995
leave scars that last forever.

00:45:23.165 --> 00:45:25.065
Mine was one of those.

00:45:26.865 --> 00:45:28.405
But maybe that's...

00:45:29.505 --> 00:45:33.745
because I never got an apology from the person who hurt me.

00:45:36.845 --> 00:45:38.975
"I'm sorry. I was wrong."

00:45:39.345 --> 00:45:40.415
If I get an apology like that,

00:45:41.485 --> 00:45:43.855
do you think I might be a little more okay then?

00:45:46.325 --> 00:45:49.325
To find that out, we first need to...

00:45:49.755 --> 00:45:50.995
eat and get our strength back.

00:45:59.535 --> 00:46:00.935
This is from my emergency stash.

00:46:01.705 --> 00:46:03.005
It's delicious. It has a nice nutty flavour.

00:46:03.335 --> 00:46:04.335
Try some.

00:46:18.355 --> 00:46:22.285
Also, Attorney Kwon Jung Hyeon will be joining LnJ.

00:46:23.195 --> 00:46:24.695
The VIP?

00:46:25.125 --> 00:46:26.125
Yes.

00:46:26.595 --> 00:46:29.895
It's best not to come to the office for a while, Min Seo.

00:46:29.995 --> 00:46:31.235
So you don't have to run into him.

00:46:39.235 --> 00:46:40.305
Have you been busy?

00:46:41.345 --> 00:46:42.675
I feel like I barely see you anymore.

00:46:45.715 --> 00:46:46.985
I just got a new case.

00:46:47.745 --> 00:46:48.745
What kind of case?

00:46:49.045 --> 00:46:50.514
Attempted murder of a Hankuk University Law student...

00:46:50.515 --> 00:46:51.555
from 20 years ago.

00:46:54.685 --> 00:46:55.685
What?

00:46:55.985 --> 00:46:57.125
The victim's a prosecutor now.

00:46:57.425 --> 00:46:59.725
You know him, right? You two were classmates.

00:46:59.965 --> 00:47:03.035
Park Ju Hwan. No, I mean, Prosecutor Park Je Yeol.

00:47:05.165 --> 00:47:08.305
You were ordered to reinvestigate? By who?

00:47:08.905 --> 00:47:10.635
By Prosecutor Park Je Yeol himself.

00:47:14.175 --> 00:47:17.945
Sorry, I have to head out first. Can you clean up after me?

00:47:42.735 --> 00:47:45.875
(Prosecutor Park Je Yeol)

00:47:50.175 --> 00:47:51.475
Yes, Park Je Yeol speaking.

00:47:52.215 --> 00:47:54.345
So this is how you're going to pressure us?

00:47:54.945 --> 00:47:56.385
How dare you drag my husband into this?

00:47:57.955 --> 00:47:59.455
"Drag him?"

00:47:59.825 --> 00:48:01.785
I'm just trying to help him score a win.

00:48:02.525 --> 00:48:03.955
Besides, I thought it would be interesting.

00:48:04.795 --> 00:48:07.165
To have your own husband be the one to arrest you.

00:48:07.425 --> 00:48:10.995
Are you trying to pick a dirty fight? Is that it?

00:48:11.195 --> 00:48:14.935
Detective Gu Seon Kyu seems like a dedicated, by-the-book guy.

00:48:15.735 --> 00:48:18.705
When he learns his wife is a suspect in an attempted murder case,

00:48:19.305 --> 00:48:22.175
I wonder how he'll react. Aren't you curious?

00:48:25.045 --> 00:48:26.415
You stay right where you are.

00:48:26.745 --> 00:48:27.785
Yes, come on in.

00:48:29.855 --> 00:48:31.415
I'm Detective Gu Seon Kyu from the Mujin Violent Crimes Unit.

00:48:32.855 --> 00:48:35.285
What to do? I seem to have a prior engagement.

00:48:36.255 --> 00:48:37.595
Just use your imagination.

00:48:37.925 --> 00:48:39.355
The conversation we're about to have.

00:48:42.495 --> 00:48:45.035
Please have a seat. I've been expecting you.

00:49:01.015 --> 00:49:02.515
Have you had a chance to look into the case?

00:49:03.585 --> 00:49:04.585
I have,

00:49:04.855 --> 00:49:06.584
but the first investigation was botched,

00:49:06.585 --> 00:49:08.325
so there are hardly any leads.

00:49:09.285 --> 00:49:10.625
Are you reopening the investigation...

00:49:11.225 --> 00:49:12.995
because you've regained your memory?

00:49:13.395 --> 00:49:15.695
Like you recalled a clue to the culprit or something.

00:49:16.995 --> 00:49:20.505
To be honest, I haven't fully recovered my memory.

00:49:21.205 --> 00:49:22.565
The fragments of memory I do have...

00:49:22.935 --> 00:49:25.435
I doubt they would even hold up in court.

00:49:27.745 --> 00:49:28.745
Then why?

00:49:29.205 --> 00:49:32.275
Let's just say I have a hunch.

00:49:32.875 --> 00:49:34.115
That you, Detective Gu,

00:49:34.415 --> 00:49:36.385
might be the one who can find the culprit.

00:49:40.485 --> 00:49:42.325
Is it because I'm Hyun Jin's husband?

00:49:46.395 --> 00:49:49.795
So you already knew about my past with Hyun Jin.

00:49:50.835 --> 00:49:52.535
You could say that.

00:49:53.605 --> 00:49:57.375
Because you, Detective Gu,

00:49:57.675 --> 00:50:00.045
are in a much better position to get statements...

00:50:00.405 --> 00:50:01.945
from Yoon Ra Young, Hwang Hyun Jin, and Kang Shin Jae.

00:50:02.475 --> 00:50:04.375
And their memories should still be perfectly clear.

00:50:05.215 --> 00:50:06.215
Really?

00:50:07.085 --> 00:50:08.085
Is that all there is to it?

00:50:09.985 --> 00:50:10.985
Why do you ask?

00:50:11.555 --> 00:50:14.325
Do you have some reason to suspect there's more to it?

00:50:16.425 --> 00:50:18.895
I don't know if this will help,

00:50:19.455 --> 00:50:21.725
but Yoon Ra Young and I were dating at the time.

00:50:22.395 --> 00:50:26.635
And on the day of the incident, all three were there with me.

00:50:27.365 --> 00:50:29.835
But the reason they were never considered suspects...

00:50:30.205 --> 00:50:32.975
was because they provided alibis for each other.

00:50:34.805 --> 00:50:36.745
Sometimes, I let my imagination run wild.

00:50:39.075 --> 00:50:41.785
Were their testimonies actually true?

00:50:43.985 --> 00:50:46.184
Then what happened with Ra Young after that?

00:50:46.185 --> 00:50:47.485
We broke up.

00:50:48.225 --> 00:50:50.695
More accurately, she's the one who broke up with me.

00:50:52.355 --> 00:50:53.665
Aren't you curious why?

00:50:55.365 --> 00:50:57.995
Every now and then, I find myself wondering.

00:51:57.655 --> 00:52:00.595
So you're really going to do what your mom says again?

00:52:01.165 --> 00:52:03.365
I'm thinking about what the best move is.

00:52:07.535 --> 00:52:08.535
I'm...

00:52:09.105 --> 00:52:10.335
done running away.

00:52:12.575 --> 00:52:14.405
Hiding it just makes it fester.

00:52:15.145 --> 00:52:18.315
Just when I think it's healed, it always splits open again.

00:52:19.545 --> 00:52:23.015
If telling the world is the price I pay to keep fighting,

00:52:24.155 --> 00:52:25.715
I'm willing to pay it, Shin Jae.

00:52:28.425 --> 00:52:29.655
Are you sure you'll be okay?

00:52:33.195 --> 00:52:34.395
For once,

00:52:35.225 --> 00:52:36.895
we should have fought for ourselves.

00:52:38.065 --> 00:52:39.065
Connect.

00:52:40.105 --> 00:52:41.335
I'm going to see this through to the end.

00:52:41.935 --> 00:52:42.935
I can't stop now.

00:52:56.385 --> 00:52:57.385
What's wrong?

00:53:21.745 --> 00:53:24.175
But the reason they were never considered suspects...

00:53:24.475 --> 00:53:27.445
was because they provided alibis for each other.

00:53:29.185 --> 00:53:31.215
Sometimes, I let my imagination run wild.

00:53:31.855 --> 00:53:34.255
Were their testimonies actually true?

00:53:36.425 --> 00:53:38.825
You know what this reminds me of?

00:53:39.525 --> 00:53:40.525
Accomplices.

00:53:41.325 --> 00:53:43.295
Their fates are tied together.

00:53:44.495 --> 00:53:45.695
If one of them goes down,

00:53:46.265 --> 00:53:48.665
the other is bound to go down with them.

00:54:02.245 --> 00:54:04.315
I took another one. It's the same.

00:54:05.155 --> 00:54:08.055
He doesn't know yet. I haven't told him.

00:54:09.155 --> 00:54:10.595
For now, you're the only ones who know.

00:54:11.625 --> 00:54:12.625
As for telling him...

00:54:12.995 --> 00:54:16.025
Shouldn't I wait until I'm more sure?

00:54:18.935 --> 00:54:21.005
- I'm home. - Hey.

00:54:25.505 --> 00:54:26.505
You're back?

00:54:29.045 --> 00:54:30.045
What now?

00:54:31.815 --> 00:54:32.815
What?

00:54:33.485 --> 00:54:35.045
Something else you're hiding from me.

00:54:35.545 --> 00:54:36.645
What on earth is it now?

00:54:38.455 --> 00:54:40.425
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

00:54:41.525 --> 00:54:42.685
What are you hiding behind your back?

00:54:43.355 --> 00:54:44.455
What am I hiding?

00:54:55.605 --> 00:54:58.005
No. We can't. Things have changed.

00:54:58.535 --> 00:55:00.405
You know how long Hyun Jin has wanted a baby.

00:55:00.875 --> 00:55:02.405
If what we did gets out,

00:55:02.775 --> 00:55:04.315
Hyun Jin will be in the most danger.

00:55:04.575 --> 00:55:06.615
Protecting Hyun Jin has to come first.

00:55:08.185 --> 00:55:11.415
You're right. It's too reckless to just charge ahead like this.

00:55:19.995 --> 00:55:21.325
Here's the information you asked for.

00:55:22.065 --> 00:55:23.065
Thank you.

00:55:25.095 --> 00:55:27.035
Is this for real?

00:55:31.405 --> 00:55:34.445
I was going to tell you once I was more certain.

00:55:35.845 --> 00:55:38.175
I was afraid you'd be disappointed if something went wrong...

00:55:39.375 --> 00:55:41.845
How can you say that?

00:55:45.215 --> 00:55:46.885
We're going to be parents?

00:55:48.585 --> 00:55:49.585
Really?

00:55:50.325 --> 00:55:53.595
- Why are you crying, silly? - I'm not crying.

00:55:54.165 --> 00:55:55.165
I'm just so happy.

00:56:00.605 --> 00:56:02.105
There might be a way.

00:56:04.605 --> 00:56:07.345
Park Je Yeol. We take him down first.

00:56:08.175 --> 00:56:09.845
So he can't breathe a word about us.

00:56:29.295 --> 00:56:30.765
Hong Yeon Hui, age 42.

00:56:31.165 --> 00:56:34.005
Spouse, a prosecutor, Mujin Prosecutors' Office, Division Three,

00:56:34.265 --> 00:56:35.265
Park Je Yeol.

00:56:39.605 --> 00:56:40.605
You.

00:56:41.745 --> 00:56:43.615
What's your real reason for approaching me?

00:56:53.955 --> 00:56:54.955
It was you, wasn't it?

00:56:55.325 --> 00:56:57.855
You're the one who tried to kill my husband 20 years ago.

00:57:01.595 --> 00:57:02.665
It was a mistake.

00:57:07.765 --> 00:57:09.635
I should have finished him off back then.

00:57:28.555 --> 00:57:32.455
(Honour)

00:58:23.875 --> 00:58:26.575
Attempted murder of a male student at Hankuk University College of Law.

00:58:26.815 --> 00:58:29.845
If this happens to Hyun Jin again, I swear I won't let it slide.

00:58:30.715 --> 00:58:32.585
You're telling me this is Jun Hyeok's laptop?

00:58:32.855 --> 00:58:34.485
I'll give you an exclusive, and I'll even do an interview.

00:58:34.885 --> 00:58:37.825
Attorney Kwon is involved. As a user.

00:58:38.225 --> 00:58:40.665
I said I would help you. That was our deal, wasn't it?

00:58:40.825 --> 00:58:43.565
I've laid all my cards on the table. So, what do you want?

00:58:44.435 --> 00:58:47.335
- Mission complete. - Jun Hyeok's laptop is gone.

00:58:47.765 --> 00:58:49.305
If there's someone who hasn't paid their due,

00:58:49.805 --> 00:58:50.805
It's you.
