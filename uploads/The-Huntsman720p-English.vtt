WEBVTT

00:31.721 --> 00:33.171
Where's the body?

00:56.918 --> 00:58.437
What the fuck?

01:36.130 --> 01:37.511
What's wrong, Daddy?

01:40.893 --> 01:42.067
Don't touch that.

01:59.498 --> 02:02.191
Law enforcement and media
outlets alike

02:02.329 --> 02:03.571
have begun calling the killer--

02:03.709 --> 02:04.710
The Huntsman.

02:04.848 --> 02:06.540
Huntsman.

02:06.678 --> 02:08.783
The Huntsman,
as in the queen's hired assassin

02:08.921 --> 02:09.922
in Snow White.

02:35.845 --> 02:37.778
The alleged killer,

02:37.916 --> 02:39.952
identified as 54-year-old
Lincoln Raider,

02:40.090 --> 02:42.162
stands accused of...

02:47.270 --> 02:48.168
Raider.

02:49.548 --> 02:50.515
How did you kill those girls?

02:53.587 --> 02:55.175
How did you
kill those girls?
- Lincoln!

02:55.313 --> 02:56.383
This is for my wife!

02:57.901 --> 02:59.179
You're a dead man.

02:59.903 --> 03:00.801
You took her from me.

03:00.939 --> 03:02.043
Help!

03:02.182 --> 03:03.183
I loved her!

03:06.186 --> 03:07.290
I loved her!

04:24.402 --> 04:25.886
On Halloween Eve,
just after dark,

04:26.024 --> 04:27.922
Ping Ping and Tao Tao
returned home,

04:28.060 --> 04:29.821
carried out a folding table,
set it in the drive--

04:31.132 --> 04:33.307
Damn! You startled me.

04:34.412 --> 04:35.758
Sorry.

04:36.448 --> 04:39.106
You must be Max.

04:40.210 --> 04:41.626
I'm Corina.

04:43.938 --> 04:45.043
Hi.

04:46.803 --> 04:48.495
So why'd you request
the rehab center?

04:49.634 --> 04:51.118
Uh, no reason, really.

04:52.602 --> 04:54.639
Well, I chose it, sweetie.

04:54.777 --> 04:57.193
I love this place.

04:57.331 --> 05:00.817
Less stress, work with patients
that don't fight back.

05:00.955 --> 05:04.407
Besides, I don't do too well
with confrontations anyway.

05:04.545 --> 05:05.650
You?

05:06.754 --> 05:07.721
I got you.

05:07.859 --> 05:08.825
Hold still! Hold still!

05:12.622 --> 05:13.761
It doesn't really bother me.

05:14.417 --> 05:16.937
It's kind you read to 'em.

05:17.075 --> 05:19.146
Oh, yeah, I read
to all the patients.

05:19.284 --> 05:21.631
I heard that some of them react
to outside stimuli.

05:23.909 --> 05:25.877
You do know who he is, right?

05:26.878 --> 05:29.570
They say he's the one that
killed those girls in Antrim.

05:30.744 --> 05:33.988
He gives me the heebie-jeebies
just bein' in here with him now.

05:36.784 --> 05:38.234
Do you need anything else
before I have to--

05:39.511 --> 05:41.133
- Max?
- No.

05:42.134 --> 05:43.481
Thank you.

05:43.619 --> 05:46.311
All right then.
You have a good night.

06:10.231 --> 06:12.095
Let's just give
the literature a break.

06:33.013 --> 06:34.635
We want answers!

06:34.773 --> 06:36.430
We want answers!

06:36.568 --> 06:38.259
We want answers!

06:38.398 --> 06:40.089
We want answers!

06:40.227 --> 06:41.953
We want answers!

06:42.091 --> 06:43.748
We want answers!

06:43.886 --> 06:45.612
We want answers!

06:45.750 --> 06:47.407
We want answers!

06:47.545 --> 06:48.960
We want answers!

06:56.588 --> 06:57.831
Hey, partner.

06:58.970 --> 07:00.385
Looks like we got another one.

07:02.249 --> 07:03.940
What do you mean? You sure?

07:04.078 --> 07:05.425
Yeah, take a look.

07:13.674 --> 07:15.158
Doesn't match.

07:15.296 --> 07:16.988
What do you mean
it doesn't match?

07:17.126 --> 07:20.267
Those are defensive wounds,
and I'd wager she still

07:20.405 --> 07:21.682
has her heart.

07:23.650 --> 07:25.134
What are you, the ME now?

07:27.067 --> 07:28.655
Look, this can't be
a coincidence.

07:30.139 --> 07:31.278
Guess who's on the lease?

07:33.936 --> 07:35.524
- Samuel Miller.
- Samuel Miller,

07:35.662 --> 07:38.354
the guy that we interviewed
when the first victim was found.

07:39.942 --> 07:42.358
And the last guy who saw
Tina Benning and Lincoln Raider

07:42.496 --> 07:44.015
the night she was murdered.

07:46.258 --> 07:47.294
They all worked together.

07:47.432 --> 07:49.572
His name's on the lease.
He's our guy.

07:50.815 --> 07:51.816
Still not right.

07:52.506 --> 07:54.335
We're about 10 minutes away
from the

07:54.474 --> 07:55.923
media reopening some old wounds.

07:56.165 --> 07:57.338
You remember what happened
last time?

07:57.477 --> 07:59.168
Grieving fathers aren't lynch
mobs, Reynolds.

07:59.306 --> 08:00.480
All right, vigilantes then.

08:04.587 --> 08:06.762
Yeah, sorry my gut's
not matching yours.

08:08.418 --> 08:11.732
You know, I always loved the way
you could shape a narrative.

08:13.285 --> 08:14.701
Actually, maybe it's
just your shape.

08:16.530 --> 08:17.738
Doesn't matter.

08:17.876 --> 08:19.602
Captain's got every K9 unit
and officer with a badge

08:19.740 --> 08:23.364
all looking for Sam Miller,
so we'll have our answers soon.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.676
I guess we will. Good.

08:24.814 --> 08:26.057
Great.

08:33.409 --> 08:34.755
Reynolds says you

08:34.893 --> 08:36.446
don't think Lincoln
Raider's our guy.

08:36.585 --> 08:37.965
Yes, sir.

08:38.103 --> 08:39.553
The problem isn't

08:39.691 --> 08:41.659
with your logic,
it's with your timin'.

08:41.866 --> 08:43.384
I'm puttin' together
a press conference

08:43.523 --> 08:45.283
to get ahead of all this before
it explodes

08:45.421 --> 08:47.078
in another negative direction.

08:47.216 --> 08:49.252
I need your support on this.

08:49.390 --> 08:50.806
What are you saying?

08:50.944 --> 08:53.394
I'm saying we're puttin' all
focus into our key suspect

08:53.533 --> 08:55.396
in the Huntsman case,
Sam Miller.

08:57.398 --> 08:58.779
- What?
- J--

08:58.917 --> 09:01.886
Jenn Littles' body was found
less than 24 hours ago.

09:02.024 --> 09:03.750
We don't have enough
answers yet for that.

09:03.888 --> 09:05.130
We don't even
have the tox report.

09:05.268 --> 09:06.649
Shouldn't we focus on the facts?

09:06.787 --> 09:07.823
Facts?

09:07.961 --> 09:09.169
Since Lincoln Raider's
been in a coma,

09:09.307 --> 09:11.274
no bodies have appeared
with the Huntsman's MO.

09:11.412 --> 09:12.586
Until yesterday.

09:12.724 --> 09:14.899
Cell phone towers have pinged
him in the radius

09:15.037 --> 09:16.279
of each of our victims
on the days

09:16.417 --> 09:17.798
that they were reported missing,

09:17.936 --> 09:20.456
and his search history has shown
everything but their name.

09:20.594 --> 09:23.010
Look, Sam Miller's
still a killer.

09:23.148 --> 09:24.564
Are we in agreement?

09:24.702 --> 09:25.599
Are we in agreement?!

09:25.737 --> 09:27.221
Yes, sir.

09:42.720 --> 09:45.688
After eight long months,
Antrim Police Department

09:45.826 --> 09:49.209
has named a new suspect
in the Huntsman murder case,

09:49.347 --> 09:50.797
Samuel Jacob Miller.

09:50.935 --> 09:54.007
White Male. 5'10, 190 lbs.

09:54.421 --> 09:56.975
and approximately 38 years old.

09:57.113 --> 10:00.323
The suspect is wanted on the
murder of one Jennifer Littles.

10:01.186 --> 10:03.879
If anyone has any information
to the whereabouts

10:04.017 --> 10:08.849
of Samuel Miller, please contact
the Antrim Police Department.

10:08.987 --> 10:10.057
Thank you.

10:10.264 --> 10:11.921
We want answers!

10:12.059 --> 10:13.682
We want answers!

10:13.820 --> 10:15.511
We want answers!

10:15.649 --> 10:17.340
We want answers!

10:17.478 --> 10:19.308
We want answers!

10:19.619 --> 10:21.448
We want answers!

10:46.300 --> 10:47.543
Come back to me.

10:51.478 --> 10:53.791
Hey, I love you.

11:04.733 --> 11:05.837
Jolene.

11:10.014 --> 11:11.222
Mrs. Raider.

11:13.569 --> 11:14.708
We're not friends.

11:15.467 --> 11:16.572
What are you doing here?

11:16.710 --> 11:17.953
Just checkin' in on him.

11:18.091 --> 11:19.126
Why?

11:19.264 --> 11:20.369
You don't care about Lincoln.

11:20.507 --> 11:21.715
You're the reason he's in here.

11:23.199 --> 11:25.719
Well, Mrs. Raider, there's a
price to pay for taking lives.

11:25.857 --> 11:27.100
Well, there should be a price
to be paid

11:27.238 --> 11:28.826
for ruining innocent ones.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.830
Are you a parent?

11:34.314 --> 11:35.349
No.

11:35.487 --> 11:38.145
No. Of course not.

11:39.008 --> 11:40.872
Well, Lincoln is.

11:42.115 --> 11:44.634
And he's got a lot of love
to come home to.

12:38.550 --> 12:40.138
Fuck! Fuck!

13:02.782 --> 13:04.128
Fuck!

13:09.236 --> 13:10.859
Fuck!

13:22.491 --> 13:24.217
Do you even remember
your first kill?

13:28.117 --> 13:30.671
That moment your blood
caught fire

13:30.810 --> 13:33.882
and you got that rush of power?

13:39.542 --> 13:41.821
When you saw more life
in them when they're dying

13:41.959 --> 13:43.305
than when they were ever alive?

13:46.446 --> 13:47.999
I do.

13:48.137 --> 13:49.311
Hmm.

13:50.933 --> 13:52.832
It's intense, pure.

13:55.627 --> 13:56.732
Hmm.

14:01.668 --> 14:03.566
Are you even listening to me?

14:07.777 --> 14:10.608
Or am I wasting my fucking time?

14:20.756 --> 14:22.516
It's time to wake up.

14:57.379 --> 14:58.621
I know you're there.

15:01.728 --> 15:02.902
I know it.

15:03.868 --> 15:05.145
I know you're there.

15:07.044 --> 15:09.701
So it's time to wake up.

15:11.117 --> 15:13.084
Wake up!

15:40.594 --> 15:41.733
Come on.

15:43.149 --> 15:44.667
Come on.

15:44.805 --> 15:45.945
Do it.

15:46.911 --> 15:48.154
Wake up.

15:49.293 --> 15:50.673
Wake up for me.

16:02.789 --> 16:03.859
Am I dead?

16:09.313 --> 16:10.314
No.

16:11.280 --> 16:12.281
Who are you?

16:16.803 --> 16:19.288
Um, I'm-- I'm a nurse.

16:20.496 --> 16:21.635
Get 'em outta here.

16:22.602 --> 16:24.017
Who?

16:24.155 --> 16:25.846
All these people.

16:29.264 --> 16:30.196
There's-- there's no one here.

16:30.334 --> 16:31.438
I'm-- I'm just gonna get
the doctor.

16:31.576 --> 16:32.853
No. No.

16:34.338 --> 16:35.615
Stay.

16:39.032 --> 16:40.206
Stay with me.

16:43.105 --> 16:44.382
Stay with me.

16:54.392 --> 16:55.393
Stay.

16:56.429 --> 16:59.087
Well, he's responsive,
but he's still pretty out of it

16:59.225 --> 17:02.435
and probably will be
for the next day or two.

17:02.573 --> 17:03.953
Okay, what time did he awake?

17:04.092 --> 17:07.750
An ICU nurse found him awake
this morning around 2:00 AM.

17:07.888 --> 17:09.062
Which one?

17:09.200 --> 17:10.236
Nurse Mason.

17:14.619 --> 17:15.517
Who is it?

17:15.655 --> 17:16.414
Who do you think it is?

17:18.761 --> 17:19.762
Can I come in?

17:20.660 --> 17:22.110
Yeah, you can come in.

17:26.769 --> 17:28.599
You alone?

17:28.737 --> 17:29.807
Ah, yeah.

17:41.198 --> 17:43.407
- What is that?
- What do you want?

17:43.545 --> 17:44.615
Hmm?

17:46.030 --> 17:47.411
I spoke to the hospital.

17:49.447 --> 17:52.554
They said that you're looking
after Lincoln Raider.

17:52.692 --> 17:54.521
- That's my new job.
- That's--

17:55.108 --> 17:56.489
What the fuck are you doing,
Max?

17:58.249 --> 17:59.975
What the fuck are you doing?

18:00.113 --> 18:01.356
- My job.
- Your job?

18:01.494 --> 18:04.255
- Yeah.
- Six dead women!

18:05.187 --> 18:06.257
You don't know
who the fuck did it.

18:06.395 --> 18:07.914
Great job. Way to go.

18:21.790 --> 18:23.240
You look like shit, Max.

18:26.484 --> 18:27.658
Are you eating?

18:27.796 --> 18:29.522
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

18:35.424 --> 18:37.288
You know I don't approve
of what you're doing.

18:37.426 --> 18:38.634
You don't approve
of what I'm doing?

18:38.772 --> 18:42.500
I don't give a fuck
what you think, so...

18:47.436 --> 18:48.817
When Mom was dying,

18:52.165 --> 18:53.580
do you remember
what I said to you?

18:55.168 --> 18:56.963
Hmm?

18:57.101 --> 18:59.172
I told you I will always be
there for you.

19:00.484 --> 19:01.623
I still am, Max.

19:09.493 --> 19:11.702
I don't really believe anything
you say anymore, Darby.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.502
Yeah.

19:31.031 --> 19:32.895
Hey, hey, hey, partner.

19:36.968 --> 19:38.211
Oh, I just thought you should
know that, uh,

19:38.349 --> 19:41.490
Jolene Raider is taking custody
of Lincoln.

19:42.491 --> 19:44.010
Discharging him
from the hospital.

19:44.148 --> 19:45.184
To where?

19:46.150 --> 19:47.220
His home.

19:49.843 --> 19:52.087
Mr. Raider, can you feel this?

19:52.225 --> 19:53.709
Blink if you do.

19:53.847 --> 19:55.642
Well done.

19:55.815 --> 19:56.919
Good.

19:57.851 --> 19:59.715
Um, Max, would you take
his hand?

20:01.717 --> 20:03.926
Squeeze Max's hand.

20:07.067 --> 20:09.000
Go ahead.
As hard as you can.

20:12.832 --> 20:13.833
Good.

20:14.661 --> 20:15.731
Hmm.

20:20.943 --> 20:22.876
I'll draft
his release paperwork.

20:23.083 --> 20:24.395
Thank you. Thank you so much.

20:26.742 --> 20:27.709
Thank you.

20:28.537 --> 20:31.333
Is it Max? Isn't it?
Hi, I'm-- I'm Jolene.

20:31.471 --> 20:34.405
I'm-- I'm Lincoln's wife.
I'm-- I'm so grateful.

20:34.543 --> 20:36.718
Thank you so much.

20:36.856 --> 20:37.926
Of course.

20:41.688 --> 20:43.207
Hey, sweetheart.

20:44.173 --> 20:45.416
I think I'm gonna join you.

20:45.554 --> 20:46.555
Yeah?

20:50.904 --> 20:51.595
Hi.

20:53.907 --> 20:55.115
Oh, babe.

20:56.151 --> 20:58.705
Things are only gonna get better
from here, okay?

20:58.843 --> 21:00.259
Hmm.

21:00.604 --> 21:01.605
Hey.

21:09.129 --> 21:10.476
Guess who this is?

21:12.305 --> 21:13.582
Who?

21:14.859 --> 21:18.104
This is Rose.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.660
She's your daughter.

21:23.385 --> 21:26.733
I call her Rosie
because her cheeks are so red.

21:29.805 --> 21:30.599
You're a father.

21:35.466 --> 21:37.296
It's okay. It's okay.

21:38.469 --> 21:39.988
It's okay.
You're comin' home.

21:44.268 --> 21:46.995
Protestors have been outside
since early this morning

21:47.133 --> 21:49.273
waiting for Lincoln
and his family

21:49.411 --> 21:52.690
to be released into
the custody of local PD.

22:05.565 --> 22:06.877
What the fuck?

22:33.282 --> 22:34.387
Hey, sweetheart.

22:35.043 --> 22:36.907
You ready to go home?

22:38.046 --> 22:39.288
Let's go home.

22:40.324 --> 22:41.360
Okay.

22:54.303 --> 22:56.720
I trust the police isn't gonna
fuck this up this time?

22:57.790 --> 22:58.929
That's correct.

23:58.091 --> 24:01.647
What do you want to say to the
families of the missing girls?

24:01.785 --> 24:03.442
What would you like to say to
them?

24:07.480 --> 24:08.101
Murderer!

24:09.931 --> 24:10.966
Justice!

24:11.104 --> 24:13.659
Hey, hey! Stay back! Stay back!

24:17.801 --> 24:19.112
Out of the way!

25:08.265 --> 25:09.542
Don't look at them.

25:23.832 --> 25:25.662
Hey. You're home.

25:46.786 --> 25:50.583
Okay, do not hesitate to call
for anything, okay?

25:50.721 --> 25:52.689
And don't field any questions
'til you run 'em through us.

25:52.827 --> 25:53.828
Okay.

25:53.966 --> 25:55.312
- Okay.
- Thank you.

25:55.450 --> 25:56.624
Welcome home, Mr. Raider.

26:00.938 --> 26:02.043
Hey.

26:05.391 --> 26:06.357
Let's get you cleaned up.

26:06.495 --> 26:08.152
Oh.

26:08.290 --> 26:09.775
There's someone
I want you to meet.

27:00.411 --> 27:02.621
- Police! Don't move!
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

27:02.759 --> 27:03.656
Darby, it's me!

27:03.794 --> 27:05.175
What are you doing here?

27:05.313 --> 27:06.694
Will you lower your gun?

27:06.832 --> 27:08.523
Start talking.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.458
All right, look,
the Bennings called.

27:12.976 --> 27:14.943
They said they've been receiving
cryptic packages,

27:15.081 --> 27:17.463
so I thought I'd come
check it out.

27:17.601 --> 27:18.982
Will you please lower your gun?

27:22.123 --> 27:23.193
What packages?

27:25.782 --> 27:27.128
Let's go find out together.

27:38.035 --> 27:41.176
Lincoln Raider isn't responsible
for the murder of my daughter.

27:41.314 --> 27:43.454
And you know this
to be true how?

27:44.732 --> 27:47.493
Myself and the families have
received packages

27:47.631 --> 27:48.977
from the real killer.

27:50.323 --> 27:51.531
Wait, what do you mean, you--

27:52.809 --> 27:54.742
You and the other
victims' families?

27:55.812 --> 27:56.882
Yes.

27:57.020 --> 27:58.193
Why are you just reporting
this now?

28:00.575 --> 28:02.646
Eight months,
you're empty-handed.

28:02.784 --> 28:04.027
I don't trust you.

28:07.651 --> 28:09.066
Okay, what's in these packages?

28:12.069 --> 28:13.968
I won't have it in my house.

28:16.073 --> 28:18.213
It's filthy and indecent.

28:33.884 --> 28:36.128
Charles, this could've been sent
by anyone,

28:37.094 --> 28:38.889
any fanatic following the media.

28:39.027 --> 28:41.064
No. It's him.

28:42.237 --> 28:43.687
Sam Miller.

28:43.825 --> 28:44.895
I know it.

28:46.034 --> 28:47.277
He's taunting me.

28:47.415 --> 28:49.175
We're lookin' for him,
Mr. Benning.

28:50.590 --> 28:51.626
We will get him.

28:52.834 --> 28:54.456
Look, we'll need to collect
this as evidence.

28:54.594 --> 28:57.011
Also, get your fingerprints,
too,

28:57.149 --> 28:59.599
just to differentiate in case
we find any others.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.878
I'll talk to captain,
coordinate gettin' the packages

29:02.016 --> 29:03.017
from the other families.

29:03.155 --> 29:04.259
Hmm.

29:05.398 --> 29:07.573
I'd like to take another look
at Tina's room.

29:50.823 --> 29:54.378
From high rooftops,
down to the sea,

29:55.448 --> 29:59.452
♪ no one's as dear
as baby to me. ♪

30:00.522 --> 30:02.524
♪ Wee little hands, ♪

30:06.839 --> 30:08.876
♪ now sound asleep, ♪

30:09.808 --> 30:12.155
♪ till morning light. ♪

30:32.313 --> 30:33.348
Please don't hurt me.

32:16.348 --> 32:17.936
Hello.

32:18.074 --> 32:19.316
Who is this?

32:26.116 --> 32:27.531
Why am I here?

32:27.669 --> 32:31.018
I wanted to say thank you
and offer you a job.

32:33.606 --> 32:34.642
Hmm.

32:36.092 --> 32:37.610
Doin' what?

32:37.748 --> 32:39.474
What you have been doing.

32:39.612 --> 32:40.855
Taking care of Lincoln.

32:42.339 --> 32:45.032
We need 24-hour assistance,
room and board.

32:45.170 --> 32:46.895
With competitive compensation.

32:47.034 --> 32:48.345
Very.

32:49.622 --> 32:50.623
What about home health?

32:51.624 --> 32:53.316
They have staff that can provide
that kinda support.

32:53.454 --> 32:55.180
No. No.

32:56.802 --> 32:59.184
I don't trust them, not after
what I've been through.

32:59.322 --> 33:00.323
I want you.

33:02.670 --> 33:03.982
Why do you trust me?

33:05.155 --> 33:06.501
Because you brought
him back to me.

33:10.195 --> 33:11.644
And he trusts you.

33:13.163 --> 33:14.164
Lincoln does?

33:16.304 --> 33:17.581
Who do you think asked for you?

33:26.659 --> 33:27.902
It's beautiful here.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.007
- It really is.
- Hmm.

33:29.145 --> 33:30.629
We love it.

33:30.767 --> 33:32.872
- How long
have you been here?
- 20 years.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.219
- Wow.
- I know.

33:35.737 --> 33:39.707
We met when we were kids,
so I don't know, we love it.

33:39.845 --> 33:41.605
We built it from the ground up.

33:41.743 --> 33:43.711
We both came from nothin',
so it's--

33:44.712 --> 33:46.541
It's everything to us right now.

33:47.646 --> 33:48.543
We want justice!

33:48.681 --> 33:50.338
We want justice!

33:51.995 --> 33:53.893
We want justice!
We want justice!

33:54.032 --> 33:56.172
Ignore them. They're a plague.

33:58.208 --> 33:59.692
We want justice!

33:59.830 --> 34:01.315
We want justice!

34:01.522 --> 34:02.074
We want--

34:03.593 --> 34:05.733
Who's that? Who's that?

34:07.907 --> 34:09.116
Hi.

34:09.254 --> 34:10.841
Hi.

34:10.979 --> 34:12.602
Oh, there's my Rosy, whoa.

34:12.740 --> 34:14.259
Hi.

34:15.363 --> 34:16.778
Come here, my little baby.

34:16.916 --> 34:18.470
Oh, who's a sweet girl?

34:18.608 --> 34:19.643
Oh, you sweet thing.

34:20.782 --> 34:23.233
Max, this is Rose.

34:27.789 --> 34:28.825
Hi.

34:30.240 --> 34:33.519
Oh no. Aw, she likes you.

34:35.176 --> 34:36.384
Welcome. I'm Ethel.

34:36.522 --> 34:38.145
- I'm Max. Hey.
- Hey.

34:38.283 --> 34:39.146
Where's Linc?

34:39.284 --> 34:41.286
They're inside.
Come on in.

34:41.424 --> 34:42.735
We're like family around here.

34:42.873 --> 34:43.909
Mm-hmm.

34:51.572 --> 34:54.644
Don, say hello to the company.

34:56.784 --> 34:58.165
- Hey, Jo.
- Hey.

34:58.303 --> 34:59.442
Is this your new sidekick?

34:59.580 --> 35:02.617
Yeah. This is the amazing Max.

35:02.755 --> 35:05.965
He was with Linc in the hospital
and he's gonna be helpin'

35:06.104 --> 35:07.450
us out for a while.

35:08.623 --> 35:09.762
How long you been a nurse?

35:10.625 --> 35:11.626
Since I left the Army.

35:11.764 --> 35:12.869
Oh.
Gulf War Marine.

35:13.007 --> 35:15.113
- Oh.
- Where'd you serve?

35:15.251 --> 35:16.459
Afghanistan.

35:16.597 --> 35:18.012
The graveyard of empires.

35:18.150 --> 35:20.877
Easy to march in,
hard to march out.

35:21.015 --> 35:22.292
Alexander the Great.

35:22.430 --> 35:23.707
You know your history.

35:23.845 --> 35:25.053
I know my literature.

35:25.192 --> 35:27.435
Was it as violent as the news
made it out to be?

35:28.850 --> 35:29.989
A lot of people died.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.345
Hey.

35:41.035 --> 35:42.140
She's sleeping.

35:43.071 --> 35:45.039
I-- I-- I don't want her.

35:46.005 --> 35:48.111
- Not now.
- Linc.

35:50.527 --> 35:51.459
Okay.

35:51.597 --> 35:52.771
It's time for her feeding.

35:52.909 --> 35:54.393
- Hmm.
- I'll warm up some milk.

35:54.531 --> 35:55.532
Okay.

35:57.672 --> 35:58.777
Great to meet you.

35:58.915 --> 36:00.399
- And you.
- Would you like a beer?

36:00.537 --> 36:02.505
Yeah.
Yeah, that'd be great. Thanks.

36:41.509 --> 36:43.201
Lincoln, you ready?

36:48.344 --> 36:49.345
Come on.

36:50.242 --> 36:51.381
All right.

36:51.519 --> 36:52.693
I got you.
One leg here.

36:52.831 --> 36:54.281
Yep.

37:44.883 --> 37:46.540
I miss you guys so much.

37:49.922 --> 37:52.408
I'll see you soon though.
I love you.

39:03.513 --> 39:04.652
What do you think?

39:43.450 --> 39:46.660
The house is too quiet, Max.
I hate it.

39:50.353 --> 39:52.390
Your daughter's not keeping you
up nights?

39:52.528 --> 39:54.046
Yeah. Of course.

39:56.877 --> 39:58.534
You know, I really thought
that Lincoln would be more

39:58.672 --> 39:59.914
taken with her,

40:01.399 --> 40:03.435
but he doesn't want
anything to do with her.

40:04.988 --> 40:06.956
He was so desperate
to be a father.

40:09.234 --> 40:10.718
Well, he's gone through a lot.

40:13.238 --> 40:14.412
I'm sure he'll come around.

40:16.690 --> 40:19.244
Can I ask you something?

40:19.417 --> 40:20.866
It's odd,

40:22.212 --> 40:23.455
but I'm curious.

40:24.594 --> 40:25.595
Sure. Yeah.

40:27.735 --> 40:31.359
When can he have sex with me?

40:35.294 --> 40:37.158
Uh, I suppose that's up to him.

40:37.296 --> 40:38.781
Well, I don't wanna hurt him.

40:41.162 --> 40:44.200
Okay.
Then I think probably when he

40:44.338 --> 40:46.892
can climb a flight of stairs.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.519
Yeah, I think that's probably
when he'll be ready.

41:00.043 --> 41:01.148
Okay.

41:01.286 --> 41:02.598
I don't wanna wake them up.

41:03.599 --> 41:05.739
Just staring at him
isn't gonna help.

41:05.877 --> 41:07.395
All right.

41:07.741 --> 41:09.570
I'm gonna be in the studio
if you need anything.

41:09.708 --> 41:11.296
Thanks for the talk, Max.

41:15.265 --> 41:16.715
I love you.

41:17.958 --> 41:18.821
...downstairs.

41:30.488 --> 41:31.696
Wait, wait.

41:31.834 --> 41:32.835
Hmm?

41:38.737 --> 41:40.014
Here, let me get this for you.

41:42.120 --> 41:43.017
You okay?

41:43.155 --> 41:44.260
Yeah.

41:47.574 --> 41:49.368
I got it. I got it.

41:52.337 --> 41:53.511
Thank you.

41:55.133 --> 41:57.515
If you're gonna do this,
you need physical therapy.

42:00.552 --> 42:02.485
Nobody's comin' to help me.

42:17.845 --> 42:19.191
Hear them birds?

42:59.266 --> 43:00.578
Max.

43:24.084 --> 43:25.119
Who you looking for?

43:25.257 --> 43:26.327
Fuck.

43:29.123 --> 43:30.262
I was looking for you.

43:31.022 --> 43:32.126
Oh.

43:33.645 --> 43:34.508
Can't sleep?

43:34.646 --> 43:36.752
No, I can't sleep.

43:36.890 --> 43:38.098
Me either.

43:39.444 --> 43:40.963
I don't much want to.

43:41.860 --> 43:43.275
I'm being watched.

43:46.934 --> 43:48.280
What do you think they want?

43:51.421 --> 43:53.320
I don't really know.

43:54.459 --> 43:56.806
Their lies have become truth.

43:59.567 --> 44:00.914
My little night owl.

44:01.984 --> 44:03.364
She's obsessed.

44:03.502 --> 44:05.194
That's what I admire about her.

44:06.678 --> 44:08.507
She loves you very much,
you know that?

44:10.061 --> 44:11.338
Well,

44:12.822 --> 44:15.480
love is many things.

44:17.551 --> 44:18.794
You know,

44:20.692 --> 44:23.730
all I ever wanted
was to give her a child.

44:27.388 --> 44:31.876
But I can't even remember her
bein' pregnant.

44:33.015 --> 44:34.016
It'll come back.

44:35.189 --> 44:37.260
Doc said it might not.

44:37.398 --> 44:39.331
No, in time. It'll come back.

44:40.574 --> 44:41.609
Time.

44:45.027 --> 44:47.029
Do you know
the last thing I remember

44:47.892 --> 44:49.065
before the coma?

44:50.411 --> 44:51.758
A gun pointed at me.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.346
Then it's just dark.

44:55.244 --> 44:56.279
Just dark.

44:57.211 --> 44:58.730
I don't know if I'm alive
or dead.

45:00.145 --> 45:05.150
Just one long nightmare.

45:07.566 --> 45:09.983
This is straight-up hell
for me.

45:11.570 --> 45:13.055
But you're at home
with your family.

45:15.402 --> 45:16.644
That can't be hell.

45:20.131 --> 45:21.580
You got a lot
to look forward to.

45:31.452 --> 45:32.868
You need to get some sleep.

45:35.491 --> 45:36.561
I'm afraid.

45:37.665 --> 45:38.736
I'm afraid to.

45:43.257 --> 45:44.431
Saved--

45:45.915 --> 45:47.296
saved by an angel.

45:58.445 --> 45:59.895
It's okay.

46:01.448 --> 46:02.760
Oh.

46:07.212 --> 46:08.593
Okay.

46:09.628 --> 46:12.010
Yeah, it's okay.

48:25.903 --> 48:27.490
I almost didn't come tonight...

48:32.254 --> 48:38.294
but when I start to consider
that I won't return...

48:40.055 --> 48:42.022
I just think
about Daniel Addiman...

48:43.851 --> 48:45.612
rottin' in some prison...

48:47.855 --> 48:49.443
for protecting his family...

48:51.480 --> 48:52.688
when the police couldn't.

48:56.450 --> 48:57.865
And now another girl's dead.

49:04.596 --> 49:08.324
I know now the reason
I keep comin' back.

49:10.326 --> 49:13.674
It's, uh, less about grief.

49:15.987 --> 49:17.575
It's more about surviving,

49:20.888 --> 49:22.131
for myself

49:28.482 --> 49:30.346
and what family I have left.

49:39.907 --> 49:41.426
Bless you, my son.

50:30.268 --> 50:31.338
Sally, right?

50:32.374 --> 50:33.444
- Hi.
- Hi.

50:33.582 --> 50:34.686
Do you know who I am?

50:35.342 --> 50:36.309
I remember.

50:36.447 --> 50:37.517
Great.

50:37.655 --> 50:39.588
Sally, I need your help
with something.

50:40.347 --> 50:41.900
I need to know
where to find Sam.

50:42.694 --> 50:44.041
How would I know where Sam is?

50:45.732 --> 50:48.700
You know, it took me a while
to piece it all together

50:48.838 --> 50:50.875
because you--
you take your dad's last name,

50:51.013 --> 50:53.705
but your step-dad
is Shane Miller.

50:55.811 --> 50:57.295
Sam's your stepbrother.

50:58.745 --> 51:00.091
Like, Jenn and Tina
were your friends,

51:00.229 --> 51:02.300
so I think this is an

51:02.438 --> 51:03.991
opportunity for you
to help them here.

51:06.235 --> 51:08.651
She was just a junkie.
She was trying to set him up.

51:10.584 --> 51:12.552
- He said it was an accident.
- Okay.

51:12.690 --> 51:15.002
If Jenn Littles' death was
self-defense, we can help him.

51:16.142 --> 51:17.971
Sam is our only witness
in the Huntsman case,

51:18.109 --> 51:20.422
but right now the world thinks
that it's him.

51:21.837 --> 51:24.564
He does not want that.

51:24.702 --> 51:26.255
That is a death sentence.

51:27.774 --> 51:30.259
He is the only person who can
prove us wrong.

51:30.397 --> 51:31.812
You need to help us.

51:33.262 --> 51:34.574
Help Sam.

51:52.385 --> 51:55.457
I've got eyes in front,
no clear view inside.

51:55.595 --> 51:56.630
Are you in position?

51:56.768 --> 51:57.976
Assault element is set.

51:58.115 --> 52:00.462
Okay, wait.
We move on my call.

52:00.600 --> 52:01.635
Copy.

52:09.091 --> 52:10.299
Samuel Miller?

52:11.645 --> 52:13.716
I'm Detective Darby Albright
from the Antrim Police

52:13.854 --> 52:15.477
Department.
I just wanna talk.

52:16.926 --> 52:18.514
You don't wanna fuckin'
talk to me!

52:19.515 --> 52:20.930
You got an arsenal out there!

52:21.966 --> 52:24.037
We're here in case anything
goes wrong.

52:24.693 --> 52:28.317
We just need to stay calm,
and talk to me, okay?

52:28.524 --> 52:30.561
If you wanna share your story,
I'm here to listen,

52:30.699 --> 52:32.839
understand what happened.

52:32.977 --> 52:34.427
You don't wanna fuckin'
hear my story.

52:34.565 --> 52:35.566
You wanna kill me!

52:36.463 --> 52:38.879
I don't wanna kill you,
I wanna help you.

52:39.017 --> 52:42.366
Hey, Darby,
this is a no-knock warrant.

52:42.504 --> 52:44.161
I repeat, no-knock.

52:45.955 --> 52:47.336
I don't-- I don't believe you.

52:48.544 --> 52:50.374
Fuckin' trust you motherfuckers!

52:54.964 --> 52:56.656
Please help me.

52:56.794 --> 52:58.451
Please help me.

52:59.555 --> 53:00.936
Please.

53:04.560 --> 53:06.735
I know.
I hear how hard this is for you.

53:06.873 --> 53:08.185
I didn't mean to kill her!

53:08.323 --> 53:10.014
Sam, what's goin' on in there?

53:10.704 --> 53:11.947
It was an accident.

53:12.085 --> 53:13.051
I know.

53:14.087 --> 53:15.916
All right, you know what?
Fuck it.

53:16.054 --> 53:17.090
Let's move out.

53:18.264 --> 53:19.748
I'm here to help you, okay?

53:19.886 --> 53:22.544
If you could just come outside,
we could figure this out.

53:31.794 --> 53:34.038
I need help. Please!
He's coming after me.

53:34.176 --> 53:35.902
He's a fuckin' madman.

53:36.040 --> 53:38.318
He fuckin' made me do it.

53:39.630 --> 53:41.114
It was an accident.

53:41.252 --> 53:42.391
I know.

53:42.529 --> 53:43.944
It was an accident.

53:44.082 --> 53:45.256
I know you didn't.

53:52.988 --> 53:54.092
I'm coming in.

53:57.095 --> 53:59.236
What the fuck?
What the fuck did you do?

53:59.374 --> 54:00.996
Accountability, remember?

54:01.134 --> 54:02.584
Clear.

54:03.585 --> 54:05.103
All right, let's get CSU
in here.

54:05.242 --> 54:06.795
Tear this place apart.

54:06.933 --> 54:08.003
What?

54:44.936 --> 54:47.456
No matter how you look at this,
today was a win.

54:47.594 --> 54:49.355
We gave the community answers.

54:50.287 --> 54:52.668
Sam Miller is the Huntsman
and you need to back this.

54:52.806 --> 54:53.980
Yeah, and when you're wrong?

54:55.292 --> 54:57.708
You know, you've been fightin'
this one a long time.

54:57.846 --> 54:59.710
Captain, I think she might
need the night off.

55:00.642 --> 55:02.954
You know, it's clear you two
have given up on this case.

55:04.059 --> 55:05.647
But don't fucking expect me to.

55:08.546 --> 55:10.514
This evening, Antrim Police
Detectives,

55:10.652 --> 55:12.826
in conjunction with Special
Victims Unit,

55:12.964 --> 55:15.346
conducted a raid on the home
of a known suspect,

55:15.484 --> 55:18.832
Samuel Miller, in relation
to the Antrim murders

55:18.970 --> 55:21.179
of six female victims
earlier this year.

55:22.284 --> 55:24.217
All indications
in the investigation

55:24.355 --> 55:27.116
point to Samuel Miller
as the main suspect.

55:28.014 --> 55:30.948
As a result of the incursion,
the suspect was killed.

55:31.880 --> 55:34.572
I know that many of you
may have questions, I'm sure,

55:34.710 --> 55:36.609
but we are still piecing
together elements

55:36.747 --> 55:39.232
of the investigation that we're
still working through.

55:39.370 --> 55:40.440
Thank you.

55:40.578 --> 55:42.373
Wait, what about Lincoln Raider?

55:42.511 --> 55:43.443
What evidence links Sam Miller
to the girls who were murdered?

55:43.581 --> 55:44.686
Does he have an alibi

55:44.824 --> 55:45.618
to provide him
whereabouts?

55:45.756 --> 55:46.343
Care to comment?

55:47.516 --> 55:48.103
Detective Reynolds

56:08.399 --> 56:09.918
Lincoln, what are you
doin' here?

56:11.609 --> 56:13.300
I told you I don't sleep.

56:14.888 --> 56:17.443
My wheels just keep spinnin'.

56:20.066 --> 56:21.274
That's okay.

56:23.069 --> 56:24.519
I spent so much time
in the darkness,

56:24.657 --> 56:26.072
I feel at home out here.

56:32.561 --> 56:34.287
They're never gonna stop comin',
are they?

56:36.772 --> 56:37.946
See?

56:42.640 --> 56:44.815
World ain't gonna just forget
what happened.

56:48.370 --> 56:49.992
I guess that's my legacy.

56:51.131 --> 56:52.961
That's my legacy for Rosy.

56:57.379 --> 56:59.968
Well, one day,

57:01.003 --> 57:02.073
one day,

57:07.251 --> 57:09.840
I'll explain it to her so she
can understand it.

57:11.428 --> 57:14.154
So she can know the truth.

57:18.607 --> 57:20.022
What about you, Max?

57:21.472 --> 57:22.956
You see the truth yet?

57:30.516 --> 57:32.656
You have a beautiful daughter,
Mr. Raider.

57:32.794 --> 57:34.451
She's really gonna break hearts
one day.

57:35.762 --> 57:36.798
How old is she?

57:37.661 --> 57:39.870
Oh, a month, I think.

57:41.665 --> 57:43.839
Well, be sure to keep up with
those exercises I showed you.

57:43.977 --> 57:45.392
- I'll make sure he does.
- Yes, ma'am.

57:45.531 --> 57:48.223
It was nice meeting you ladies.
Thank you for coming out.

57:51.537 --> 57:53.400
- You doin' okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Mm-hmm.

57:55.057 --> 57:56.542
That's really Lincoln's
daughter?

57:56.680 --> 57:58.371
- Yeah.
- Okay.

57:58.509 --> 57:59.683
What?

58:00.442 --> 58:03.307
I just think Jolene is a little
old to have a baby.

58:05.999 --> 58:08.208
- Let me know if you need
anything.
- Yeah.

58:16.976 --> 58:18.425
Let's do two more.

58:20.635 --> 58:21.567
Good.

58:21.705 --> 58:23.189
I'll take that.

58:25.122 --> 58:26.364
Gentle.

58:27.331 --> 58:28.539
Same time next week?

59:11.755 --> 59:12.859
Have a good night.

59:12.997 --> 59:14.136
Oh, wait.

59:16.932 --> 59:18.244
Someone left this for you.

59:25.389 --> 59:26.666
Did you see who left it?

59:26.804 --> 59:28.323
No. It was delivered.

59:29.669 --> 59:31.740
Okay. Have a good one.

59:31.878 --> 59:33.052
Bye.

01:02:40.618 --> 01:02:41.792
Hey, Lincoln?

01:02:51.215 --> 01:02:52.182
Jolene?

01:03:50.999 --> 01:03:52.483
What you doing, Max?

01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:59.042
Sorry, I-- I wasn't tryin'
to snoop.

01:04:00.837 --> 01:04:02.908
Was looking for Lincoln,
he's not in his bed.

01:04:03.046 --> 01:04:04.875
He's probably down
with the Martins.

01:04:05.393 --> 01:04:07.084
It's the middle of the night.

01:04:07.429 --> 01:04:08.603
No rest for the wicked.

01:04:08.741 --> 01:04:09.949
Hmm.

01:04:19.752 --> 01:04:21.961
Are sure that you
weren't curious about me?

01:04:23.204 --> 01:04:24.205
What do you mean?

01:04:25.413 --> 01:04:26.448
About my work.

01:04:27.415 --> 01:04:28.692
What'd you think I meant?

01:04:34.008 --> 01:04:37.632
Must be exciting

01:04:39.289 --> 01:04:40.911
to make this.

01:04:41.049 --> 01:04:43.500
Gotta lose-- use a lot
of passion and discipline.

01:04:45.502 --> 01:04:46.572
You're cute.

01:04:47.573 --> 01:04:49.264
Yeah, it's, um,

01:04:50.265 --> 01:04:51.611
deceptively simple.

01:04:52.612 --> 01:04:56.547
I sketch, sculpt, mold,
and fill.

01:04:58.584 --> 01:04:59.550
Still curious?

01:04:59.688 --> 01:05:00.724
I am.

01:05:00.862 --> 01:05:01.898
Okay.

01:05:02.933 --> 01:05:04.245
I do a rough sketch,

01:05:05.142 --> 01:05:08.456
and then--
and then I sculpt.

01:05:08.594 --> 01:05:13.081
And that's probably
the most labor-intensive part.

01:05:13.219 --> 01:05:16.913
It's also-- it's also
where I got lost.

01:05:17.948 --> 01:05:19.363
You know?

01:05:19.777 --> 01:05:20.813
I forget to eat.

01:05:22.884 --> 01:05:26.784
Lincoln, um, used to bring me
food and sleep on the couch.

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:30.616
I think so he could be near,
but still let me do my thing.

01:05:32.445 --> 01:05:35.414
And then, I make a rubber mold.

01:05:36.829 --> 01:05:39.142
Then Barty and I muscle
it in here.

01:05:40.591 --> 01:05:42.800
- In here?
- Yeah.

01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:44.457
What's in here?

01:05:44.595 --> 01:05:45.907
The goop.

01:05:46.045 --> 01:05:47.357
The goop?

01:05:47.495 --> 01:05:51.533
Cement, water, and glass fiber

01:05:51.671 --> 01:05:53.880
- reinforced polyester resin.
- Mm.

01:05:54.019 --> 01:05:55.606
Are you taking notes?
'Cause there's a test.

01:05:55.744 --> 01:05:56.918
Mm-hmm.

01:06:03.752 --> 01:06:04.650
So--

01:06:07.446 --> 01:06:08.516
Which one?

01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:10.552
Which one is your favorite?

01:06:10.690 --> 01:06:11.864
Oh.

01:06:13.038 --> 01:06:14.591
Do you wanna meet her?

01:06:14.729 --> 01:06:16.041
I do.

01:06:16.489 --> 01:06:17.835
Okay.

01:06:29.433 --> 01:06:30.538
Hmm.

01:06:32.885 --> 01:06:34.818
She's been my muse
for a while now.

01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:38.028
She's powerful, and feminine,

01:06:38.235 --> 01:06:41.652
and-- and probably a goddess.

01:06:44.828 --> 01:06:46.002
Do you wanna touch her?

01:06:47.175 --> 01:06:48.004
Sure.

01:06:48.142 --> 01:06:49.143
Okay.

01:06:54.148 --> 01:06:55.218
Max,

01:06:56.633 --> 01:06:58.462
art is meant to be touched.

01:07:00.878 --> 01:07:02.880
There's life in there.
Can you feel it?

01:07:04.261 --> 01:07:05.711
It's extraordinary.

01:07:07.264 --> 01:07:10.302
I sometimes feel like
they just come to life

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.028
right under my hands.

01:07:13.512 --> 01:07:15.169
- You know?
- Hmm.

01:07:18.344 --> 01:07:19.345
What do you think?

01:07:22.003 --> 01:07:24.074
She's amazing.

01:07:26.076 --> 01:07:28.906
Yeah, she is.

01:07:34.119 --> 01:07:37.191
You should go find Lincoln
before she turns your head.

01:08:00.559 --> 01:08:01.629
Hey, Lincoln.

01:08:02.733 --> 01:08:04.459
You sure you should be out
here on your own?

01:08:06.599 --> 01:08:07.945
Well, the night's my time.

01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:10.845
Where you been?

01:08:11.535 --> 01:08:13.019
Nowhere.

01:08:13.158 --> 01:08:14.780
I heard your truck pull up.

01:08:16.092 --> 01:08:17.403
I was huntin'.

01:08:17.541 --> 01:08:19.785
Look, got a couple of beauties.

01:08:19.923 --> 01:08:20.648
Huh.

01:08:20.786 --> 01:08:21.959
You hungry?

01:08:23.478 --> 01:08:24.824
I'll build a fire.

01:08:34.110 --> 01:08:35.456
Back in the day,

01:08:37.147 --> 01:08:40.461
the heart was reserved
for the man who made the kill,

01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:42.808
honor the dead.

01:08:42.946 --> 01:08:44.258
You wanna try it?

01:08:49.953 --> 01:08:51.299
It's not so bad.

01:08:53.094 --> 01:08:54.785
Oh.

01:08:55.614 --> 01:08:57.685
Mm. Okay.

01:08:59.204 --> 01:09:00.377
That's chewy.

01:09:03.622 --> 01:09:06.866
My father used to drag me along
on hunting trips

01:09:07.004 --> 01:09:08.661
all the time when I was a kid.

01:09:11.250 --> 01:09:12.355
You ever hunt before?

01:09:13.977 --> 01:09:15.427
Not since my time in the army.

01:09:20.328 --> 01:09:21.778
I was just

01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:25.644
tired of being cooped
up in the house, so I

01:09:28.025 --> 01:09:29.682
thought we'd rough it tonight.

01:09:33.997 --> 01:09:35.032
You still can't sleep?

01:09:37.483 --> 01:09:38.657
Hell no.

01:09:41.315 --> 01:09:43.179
Nightmares are way too real.

01:09:45.284 --> 01:09:50.186
My subconscious is still tryin'
to reconstruct the man I used

01:09:50.324 --> 01:09:51.394
to be.

01:10:01.093 --> 01:10:02.163
You know what keeps me up?

01:10:02.301 --> 01:10:03.958
I keep thinkin' about
that little girl.

01:10:05.856 --> 01:10:07.375
What kind of legacy am--

01:10:08.652 --> 01:10:10.206
am I supposed to leave for her?

01:10:19.042 --> 01:10:20.112
Come on, buddy.

01:11:48.994 --> 01:11:51.203
I know you're watching me!

01:11:51.341 --> 01:11:52.618
Let me out!

01:11:59.729 --> 01:12:01.144
I know you're watching me.

01:12:01.351 --> 01:12:03.042
I'm not drinking it!

01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:05.044
I'm not drinking it!

01:13:38.552 --> 01:13:39.863
Be right back.

01:13:57.743 --> 01:13:58.779
Hello?

01:14:26.772 --> 01:14:28.118
Hey, take off the fuckin' hood.

01:14:29.395 --> 01:14:30.466
Now!

01:14:35.056 --> 01:14:36.506
You have it?

01:14:36.644 --> 01:14:37.921
Relax.

01:14:45.170 --> 01:14:46.309
Get the fuck out of here.

01:14:56.388 --> 01:14:57.734
What the fuck?

01:14:59.322 --> 01:15:01.945
Yeah, this is
Detective Reynolds, Antrim PD.

01:15:02.843 --> 01:15:07.675
Uh, I need a background check on
a Maxwell Mason, goes by Max.

01:15:09.228 --> 01:15:12.197
Yeah, employment history,
property ownership info,

01:15:12.335 --> 01:15:13.370
everything.

01:15:14.751 --> 01:15:15.821
Mm-hmm.

01:15:17.029 --> 01:15:18.099
Okay.

01:15:18.237 --> 01:15:20.343
No, actually, just, uh,
email to me only.

01:15:22.138 --> 01:15:23.173
Thanks.

01:15:26.625 --> 01:15:27.902
Who are you?

01:16:06.354 --> 01:16:07.563
Hey.

01:16:07.701 --> 01:16:09.323
How'd you sleep?

01:16:09.461 --> 01:16:11.187
Fine.

01:16:11.325 --> 01:16:13.292
- You want some breakfast?
- Mm-mm.

01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:14.570
I'm famished.

01:16:16.261 --> 01:16:18.884
Forgot how much I enjoy
the simple pleasures in life,

01:16:20.092 --> 01:16:21.231
like an appetite.

01:16:25.615 --> 01:16:26.616
You all right?

01:16:27.444 --> 01:16:28.963
You don't seem so good.

01:16:30.033 --> 01:16:31.000
I'm fine.

01:16:36.108 --> 01:16:37.109
What do you want?

01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:44.876
I can't figure you out.

01:16:46.809 --> 01:16:47.982
Well, that makes two of us.

01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:50.053
You're working for the Raiders
now?

01:16:50.951 --> 01:16:52.642
Max, what the fuck
are you thinking?

01:16:54.851 --> 01:16:56.128
You start without me?

01:17:06.207 --> 01:17:07.346
Maxwell Mason.

01:17:08.313 --> 01:17:10.246
You know, I did my research
on you.

01:17:10.487 --> 01:17:13.283
Your wife was a mortgage
processor, ran planned urban

01:17:13.421 --> 01:17:14.768
development in Antrim.

01:17:14.906 --> 01:17:16.804
You both own the condo
that you previously lived at.

01:17:16.942 --> 01:17:19.358
And she went missing
eight months ago.

01:17:19.496 --> 01:17:21.706
- Is that a question?
- No, it's not a question.

01:17:22.534 --> 01:17:23.742
You know, I do have a question
though.

01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:25.848
How do you know Lincoln Raider?

01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:29.196
He was a coma patient
I was placed with.

01:17:29.334 --> 01:17:30.991
Bullshit.

01:17:31.129 --> 01:17:33.372
I have a contract
here between the PUD

01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:35.858
and Antrim landscaping experts.

01:17:35.996 --> 01:17:38.101
Lincoln worked the property
that you lived at.

01:17:38.826 --> 01:17:39.965
He knew your wife.

01:17:41.242 --> 01:17:42.243
So what?

01:17:43.486 --> 01:17:45.315
So she goes missing
and then eight months later,

01:17:45.453 --> 01:17:47.352
you request a transfer
to this city, specifically

01:17:47.490 --> 01:17:49.526
Lincoln's rehab facility
where you look after him.

01:17:49.665 --> 01:17:50.562
- Max, if you could just--
- Hey, shut up!

01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:52.184
You're not supposed
to even be here.

01:17:54.359 --> 01:17:55.360
Answer the question.

01:18:00.365 --> 01:18:02.091
Uh, I needed a job.

01:18:03.575 --> 01:18:05.059
You needed a job.

01:18:06.095 --> 01:18:09.926
Is that also why you took
the job to personally look

01:18:10.064 --> 01:18:11.065
after him at his home?

01:18:12.895 --> 01:18:14.690
You see what this looks like, right?

01:18:15.691 --> 01:18:18.417
Obsession?
Trust?

01:18:19.522 --> 01:18:20.696
Maybe you're framin' him.

01:18:22.525 --> 01:18:24.458
Lincoln also knew
all the other victims.

01:18:25.286 --> 01:18:27.116
We actually have multiple
witnesses that can corroborate

01:18:27.254 --> 01:18:29.256
that, but we can never
link Lincoln Raider

01:18:29.394 --> 01:18:31.637
to any of the murders
with any hard evidence.

01:18:32.777 --> 01:18:34.571
I think I'm actually starting
to see why now.

01:18:37.402 --> 01:18:38.921
I bet you're wondering
how I got this.

01:18:42.234 --> 01:18:45.686
Now, you put a lot of time
and energy into that, Max.

01:18:46.722 --> 01:18:48.862
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you looked up to Lincoln

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.173
like a mentor.

01:18:51.588 --> 01:18:53.832
Or maybe you're just
his pathetic little protégé.

01:18:56.559 --> 01:18:57.629
There he is.

01:18:58.906 --> 01:19:00.252
Suddenly I'm feelin' inspired.

01:19:05.016 --> 01:19:07.743
How do you go about choosing
your next victim whenever you

01:19:07.881 --> 01:19:09.330
get the itch?

01:19:09.468 --> 01:19:11.816
Was there a characteristic in
particular that caught your eye?

01:19:13.058 --> 01:19:14.853
A specific body type maybe?

01:19:15.647 --> 01:19:17.097
Did you research them?

01:19:19.064 --> 01:19:20.272
Chart their routine?

01:19:21.515 --> 01:19:22.654
And what'd you do
with their bodies

01:19:22.792 --> 01:19:23.862
when you are finished
with them?

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.415
I'll tell you how I do it.

01:19:26.865 --> 01:19:28.625
Would you like to hear that,
Lincoln?

01:19:32.146 --> 01:19:33.423
That was me fucking with him.

01:19:33.561 --> 01:19:34.839
- Mm.
- Do your research.

01:19:34.977 --> 01:19:36.461
Just casual conversation then?

01:19:36.599 --> 01:19:38.601
Coma patients, they can, um,

01:19:38.739 --> 01:19:39.982
draw on memories,
remember things.

01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:41.673
So, that's what that is.

01:19:41.811 --> 01:19:42.985
Yeah, just casual conversation?

01:19:43.123 --> 01:19:44.745
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so he wouldn't forget.

01:19:45.642 --> 01:19:47.161
Or so maybe you'd
have an audience.

01:19:49.646 --> 01:19:53.271
Were you also fucking with Ava
when you murdered her?

01:19:53.409 --> 01:19:55.135
Because we found her body
this morning.

01:20:19.055 --> 01:20:20.298
Ava's dead?

01:20:21.471 --> 01:20:23.059
Yeah, she was murdered, Max.

01:20:24.371 --> 01:20:26.028
Same MO as the Huntsman.

01:20:32.931 --> 01:20:36.521
Read me my rights
or let me fucking go.

01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:41.871
Read him his rights.

01:20:59.026 --> 01:21:00.131
Max.

01:21:00.269 --> 01:21:01.304
You probably shouldn't talk
to her right now.

01:21:01.442 --> 01:21:02.581
I know.

01:21:07.932 --> 01:21:10.037
Just so you know,
we're gettin' Ava's

01:21:10.175 --> 01:21:12.419
phone records,
GPS info, everything.

01:21:12.557 --> 01:21:14.524
Your brother is not
who you think he is.

01:21:59.017 --> 01:22:00.432
No.

01:22:00.570 --> 01:22:01.882
No.

01:22:45.132 --> 01:22:46.444
Fuck!

01:22:47.928 --> 01:22:49.274
Cheeks.

01:22:50.103 --> 01:22:51.276
Just sleeping.

01:22:54.452 --> 01:22:55.556
Where is he?

01:22:55.694 --> 01:22:56.937
What?

01:22:57.075 --> 01:22:58.352
Where is he?
Do you know what happened?

01:22:58.490 --> 01:23:00.458
- No.
- She's dead.

01:23:00.699 --> 01:23:02.874
- Who?
- Ava's fucking dead!

01:23:03.012 --> 01:23:04.117
And they think I did it!

01:23:04.255 --> 01:23:05.601
Why would they think you did it?

01:23:07.327 --> 01:23:09.260
Have a seat, son.
You don't look so good.

01:23:09.398 --> 01:23:10.399
He's just tired.

01:23:11.193 --> 01:23:12.780
Where is he?

01:23:12.918 --> 01:23:15.507
- Max.
- Where the fuck is Lincoln?

01:23:15.645 --> 01:23:17.923
Shh, shh, shh. Max.

01:23:20.650 --> 01:23:21.893
Down by the river.

01:23:25.138 --> 01:23:26.311
By the river.

01:23:30.039 --> 01:23:31.213
Max?

01:23:31.351 --> 01:23:33.422
It's okay. Let him go.

01:23:33.594 --> 01:23:35.907
What'd he mean
they think it's him?

01:23:46.849 --> 01:23:47.988
Lincoln!

01:23:51.681 --> 01:23:53.821
Where the fuck are you?

01:24:03.452 --> 01:24:04.591
Lincoln!

01:24:13.945 --> 01:24:15.395
Where the fuck--

01:25:12.417 --> 01:25:13.522
Where were you last night?

01:25:14.281 --> 01:25:15.696
Where?

01:25:15.834 --> 01:25:16.835
I was out here

01:25:16.973 --> 01:25:18.389
No, you're lying.

01:25:18.527 --> 01:25:19.493
Max.

01:25:19.631 --> 01:25:21.392
You're lying!
Don't fucking lie to me!

01:25:21.875 --> 01:25:24.153
Well, it looks like you got your
mind made up about somethin'.

01:25:24.291 --> 01:25:26.431
Why don't you just ask me
what you come here to ask?

01:25:27.674 --> 01:25:28.778
Did you kill Ava?

01:25:29.710 --> 01:25:30.573
- Huh?
- Max.

01:25:30.711 --> 01:25:33.369
Hey, did you kill those girls?

01:25:33.576 --> 01:25:34.646
Hmm?

01:25:36.165 --> 01:25:39.064
You know, the police,
those reporters,

01:25:40.514 --> 01:25:41.722
when they look at me

01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:44.139
all they see is a tree
that they wanna chop down.

01:25:45.036 --> 01:25:46.141
And they're using sledgehammers.

01:25:46.279 --> 01:25:48.695
It's ugly,
it's cruel, it's hurtful.

01:25:52.250 --> 01:25:53.872
Jolene said they took you in, too.

01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:56.461
They corrupt your mind?

01:25:57.945 --> 01:25:59.326
They poison you, too?

01:26:01.363 --> 01:26:02.640
Or did you do that to yourself?

01:27:11.433 --> 01:27:12.882
Hey.

01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:14.125
Try to wait for Nichols, yeah?

01:27:14.263 --> 01:27:15.782
I just keep telling the truth.

01:27:16.886 --> 01:27:18.923
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Okay, let's go.

01:27:36.458 --> 01:27:38.839
Max, those idiots
are releasing Lincoln.

01:27:38.977 --> 01:27:39.909
I'm gonna go pick him up.

01:27:40.047 --> 01:27:41.394
Are you takin' Rosy?

01:27:41.532 --> 01:27:42.671
No, I'm gonna take her
to the Martins.

01:27:42.809 --> 01:27:43.913
No, I'll-- I'll take her.

01:27:44.051 --> 01:27:45.846
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:27:46.088 --> 01:27:47.158
Yeah, I'll watch her.

01:27:48.297 --> 01:27:50.265
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

01:27:51.196 --> 01:27:52.543
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:27:53.371 --> 01:27:54.096
Here you go.

01:27:54.234 --> 01:27:55.442
Okay. Oh, I got her.

01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:56.995
All right.

01:27:57.133 --> 01:27:58.203
This has everything she'll need,

01:27:58.342 --> 01:28:00.240
but I should be back
really quickly.

01:28:00.378 --> 01:28:01.414
Keys.

01:28:03.968 --> 01:28:05.245
Thank you, Max.

01:28:05.383 --> 01:28:06.936
Okay.

01:28:16.636 --> 01:28:17.671
Come on.

01:28:17.809 --> 01:28:19.190
I got you.

01:28:41.937 --> 01:28:42.972
What do you want?

01:28:43.110 --> 01:28:44.353
What the fuck
was that recording about?

01:28:46.079 --> 01:28:47.701
I don't have to explain
myself to you.

01:28:47.839 --> 01:28:49.116
Well, congratulations.

01:28:49.254 --> 01:28:50.670
You just incriminated yourself
in this investigation.

01:28:50.808 --> 01:28:54.052
No, you incriminated me when you
handed over that MP3 file.

01:28:54.190 --> 01:28:55.122
What?

01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:57.815
The-- the device.

01:28:57.953 --> 01:28:59.126
The one you took
from Lincoln and gave

01:28:59.264 --> 01:29:00.576
to your fucking partner.

01:29:00.714 --> 01:29:01.784
What? No.

01:29:03.614 --> 01:29:05.823
Reynolds said Jolene Raider
gave it to him.

01:29:09.378 --> 01:29:10.310
I gotta go.

01:29:10.448 --> 01:29:11.656
Max, wait for me.
Wait--

01:33:40.476 --> 01:33:41.685
Why?

01:33:41.823 --> 01:33:42.927
You know why.

01:33:45.792 --> 01:33:48.208
Love. Back up.

01:33:52.178 --> 01:33:53.317
Back up!

01:33:59.875 --> 01:34:00.980
Well, here we are.

01:34:01.118 --> 01:34:03.292
Just the, uh, the three of us.

01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:04.742
Mm.

01:34:05.743 --> 01:34:06.951
I'm curious, Max,

01:34:07.952 --> 01:34:10.265
when you look into Rosy's eyes,

01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:12.923
who do you see?

01:34:16.961 --> 01:34:18.618
I'm gonna fuckin' end you.

01:34:19.999 --> 01:34:21.138
Yeah.

01:34:22.277 --> 01:34:24.175
You know, I made a mistake.

01:34:25.038 --> 01:34:26.384
I did.

01:34:26.522 --> 01:34:30.665
I thought that a baby would
bring Lincoln closer to me,

01:34:30.803 --> 01:34:34.220
but he doesn't care about
her,

01:34:34.358 --> 01:34:35.428
and I have Lincoln back.

01:34:35.566 --> 01:34:38.189
And honestly, I really think

01:34:38.327 --> 01:34:40.329
I wasn't actually
meant to be a mother.

01:34:41.365 --> 01:34:42.849
Take me to her.

01:34:42.987 --> 01:34:44.506
Mm, no. Not yet.

01:34:44.644 --> 01:34:45.921
Right fuckin' now!

01:34:46.059 --> 01:34:47.889
Right fuckin' now!

01:34:48.752 --> 01:34:50.132
Oh my God.

01:34:50.270 --> 01:34:53.239
Oh, Max, that was great.

01:34:53.377 --> 01:34:54.585
No.

01:34:57.036 --> 01:34:58.106
Tell me where she is.

01:34:58.244 --> 01:34:59.452
- No.
- Please.

01:34:59.590 --> 01:35:02.351
Please, please, please.
Take me to--

01:35:02.489 --> 01:35:03.698
Jolene.

01:35:04.077 --> 01:35:07.391
You have no power here.

01:35:10.049 --> 01:35:11.602
This is not a game.

01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:15.088
But, Max, that's all it is.

01:35:25.892 --> 01:35:27.342
Oh.

01:35:29.896 --> 01:35:31.104
Beautiful.

01:36:06.968 --> 01:36:08.141
Hey.

01:36:15.804 --> 01:36:16.805
I'm here.

01:36:16.943 --> 01:36:17.841
I got you.

01:36:17.979 --> 01:36:19.049
How is she?

01:36:19.187 --> 01:36:21.465
She's suffering from
hypothermia and hypoxia.

01:36:21.603 --> 01:36:22.984
We need to get her
to the hospital.

01:36:23.950 --> 01:36:25.400
Okay. Go be with Rae.

01:36:25.538 --> 01:36:26.642
Go be with your wife.

01:36:34.098 --> 01:36:35.582
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:36:36.618 --> 01:36:37.826
You're safe.

01:36:39.276 --> 01:36:40.346
I love you.

01:37:33.123 --> 01:37:34.814
What the fuck is that?

01:37:37.644 --> 01:37:39.508
Jesus,
I think it's Sara Addiman.

01:38:06.915 --> 01:38:08.054
Rae?

01:38:18.099 --> 01:38:19.514
I'm Lincoln.

01:38:25.830 --> 01:38:27.108
I'm Max's friend.

01:38:33.597 --> 01:38:34.874
He said it's your favorite.

01:38:35.771 --> 01:38:37.118
But, uh...
