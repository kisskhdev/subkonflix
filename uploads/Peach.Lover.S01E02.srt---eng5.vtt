00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:11.470
Hello , Everyone

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.910
The reason I came back today

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.910
to open applications for a new Peach

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.620
Are you sure?

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.630
about becoming my new Peach?

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.460
I'm sure

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.440
I’m curious

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.950
How did you become Peach Lover ?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.290
Peachlover

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.620
isn’t by chance

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.920
it’s the place I chose for myself

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.580
Do you still want to be my peach?

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.930
Have you ever

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.090
tried the taste of a peach?

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.730
The taste of a peach doesn’t just mean the fruit

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.980
But it’s also a symbol of happiness

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:06.200
Sweetness

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.340
and satisfaction

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.550
in both physica

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.760
and emotionally

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.250
They say

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.400
when a peach is perfectly ripe

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.380
its sweetness

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.310
will be stuck in my heart

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.230
so anyone who tastes it

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.120
will never forget

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.370
All of my life

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.370
I never imagined I’d experience something like this

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.600
From a simple artist

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.380
in my own space

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.150
in my own

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.470
I finally met Peach Lover

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.310
Sasom

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.800
Someone I thought I could never reach

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:17.590
Sasom

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.940
I'm not hurt

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.980
Both...

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.110
happy

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.280
surprised

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.530
and afraid

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.390
but the most obvious thing

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.430
I'm so damn happy

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.790
I don't know what tomorrow will be

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.550
He might hurt me

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.710
or make me happier

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.440
But I chose it

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.530
to walk this path with him

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.770
This is my first memory

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.340
and it won’t be the last

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.210
no matter what happens from here on

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.820
So let’s see

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.950
from now on

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.570
What will I have to face ?

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.230
I went over my limit last night

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.300
So soft

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.320
So intoxicating

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.130
Maybe because he’s new

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:21.050
still fresh

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.060
untouched

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.550
You’re mine now

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:09.350
Hello , In

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.270
Come pick me up

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.270
I’ll be late for the fitting

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.240
I’m waiting out front already

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.340
You really get me, man

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.330
What’s wrong with me?

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:58.210
Just put it wherever

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:01.440
ID - SM - 7831 Add me

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.020
A peach the sweetest, most fragrant of fruits

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.390
At the first bite

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:07.570
its juiciness fills the heart

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.000
And it becomes even sweeter

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.950
when you know it’s the first of the season

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.060
one no one has ever tasted before

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:17.960
A Peach

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.350
sweet because it’s fresh

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.920
and because it exists for only one season

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.360
You look so happy today

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:30.000
Yes

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.820
I’m so really happy, In.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:35.570
Is this about Po?

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.350
Do you know, In?

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:41.300
I asked Po

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:44.590
if he was going to tell anyone about me

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.360
Do you know what his answer was?

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.000
What was his answer?

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.690
What would I gain, other than ruining your life?

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.290
I really liked that.

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:04.830
Time to go

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.530
Today was brighter than I thought

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.480
I figured I’d end up hurting

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.790
or at least worn out and exhausted

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.980
But that wasn’t it

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:39.300
I wasn’t hurting

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:40.900
I wasn’t aching

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:43.910
It felt like

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:48.550
Sasom was always inside me

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:42.780
ID - SM - 7831 Add me

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:57.760
I smiled

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.570
I didn’t even notice when I started smiling

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:41.510
Right now, I can still feel… you inside me

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.920
Your name is Sasom

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:57.570
I really want to be your keepsake

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.490
Excuse me

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:32.870
Would you like a tote bag?

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:33.900
The design is really beautiful

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.900
It’s only 89 baht

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:37.710
No, thank you

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:38.840
Hmm…

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.080
You really don’t want one?

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.240
Here take a look first

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:53.840
Uh… how many designs are there?

00:13:53.840 --> 00:14:00.600
Hmm, there are four designs to collect

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.150
So..

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:23.780
I’ll take all of them

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.800
Hmm… you must be a Sasom fan too

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.800
right?

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:30.310
Alright

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.390
I’ll wrap them up for you

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:36.890
Thank you

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:38.760
Put some love into it, okay

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:17.110
Sure

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:18.700
Hello, Mr. Po

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.270
How’s the project I briefed you on coming along?

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:25.740
It’s nearly finished

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.370
Okay, Mr. Po

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:30.630
In that case, could you please help speed it up a bit?

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:32.270
Thank you

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.870
I’m almost at your house

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:00.030
Okay

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:01.430
“Could you open the door and wait for me?

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.410
I’m afraid someone might see me

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.040
That way, I can go straight in when I get there

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:10.090
Alright. I’ll leave the door open for you

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.850
Hmmm..

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:06.660
You haven’t had dinner yet?

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.230
Not yet

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.250
I was waiting for you

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.490
Hmm… then let’s eat together

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:15.589
Okay

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:28.000
Were you busy today?

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:30.630
I’ve been waiting ages for your reply

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:35.150
Are you upset with me?

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:38.230
I’m not upset. I’m just…

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.000
annoyed?

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:41.520
No.

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:48.780
So

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:51.960
what did you do today?

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.690
Hmm…today

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:56.770
I had a fitting in the morning

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:59.040
Then an interview later on

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.140
From noon until five

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:03.620
I had drama reshoots

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:05.040
The schedule was crazy

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:09.150
Wow… then make sure you eat a lot

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:21.150
Aren’t your parents home?

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:32.130
No

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:51.920
Actually, I used to live with just my mom

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:56.830
But she passed away a long time ago

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:00.450
My dad...

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:08.860
he lives in another house now

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:12.660
With his new wife

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:16.220
even before he threw my mom and me out

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.500
I’m sorry about that

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.470
It’s okay

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:30.000
I’m fine now

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.420
That was her decision

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.530
Her life

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
isn’t mine

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:46.990
You’re really talented

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:50.620
I saw it on your application

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:52.170
You draw as well, don’t you?

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:56.660
Yes

00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:01.380
amazing

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:04.440
Thank you

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:07.900
I wish I had a friend who’s an artis

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:13.470
So

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:17.370
would you like me to be your friend?

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:24.370
So… you’d have an artist as a friend

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.360
Being my friend isn’t easy, you know

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.630
Why?

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:39.020
My parents won’t let me hang out with anyone who isn’t famous

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:42.670
Even friends of mine who are actors

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:44.240
if they’re not popular

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:48.350
I’m not allowed to see them

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:51.120
Hey… but I am famous, you know

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.970
If you don’t believe me

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:57.250
go ask anyone in the book industry.

00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:59.230
No one there doesn’t know

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.820
Japo

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.540
I’m really serious

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:11.890
Please believe me

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:12.990
I believe you

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:16.490
But my parents don’t know you

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:21.130
Ouch… that hurts

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:27.520
So

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.770
would you model for me?

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:36.670
Maybe I’ll become a famous artist

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:42.130
Famous enough

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:48.330
for your parents to know me

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.200
Could you take your clothes off for me

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:20.980
No… keep it on

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.870
Take off your pants too

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:22.220
Let me draw you first

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:43.020
I actually like it

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.790
It just bothers me a little

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.870
Look

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:22.170
the real thing is larger

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:43.540
So

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:46.480
you’re not going anywhere

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.180
You’ve got to learn

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:56.050
from your mistakes first

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:51.310
See? The real thing

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:54.820
you didn’t even draw half of it

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:38.550
Hello

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:40.300
Today, agricultural scientists

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:44.500
shared an interesting study about peaches

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:47.290
a popular fruit known not only for its sweet, juicy flavor

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:50.390
but also for the hidden meaning behind its size

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:54.180
really?

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:57.330
The meaning of size?

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.770
Yes. It’s said that

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:03.980
big, plump peaches that fit perfectly in your hand

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.980
are considered ready

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:08.880
and ideal for tasting

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:11.920
Unlike smaller peaches

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.530
which may not be fully ripe

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.580
or simply not ready yet

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:19.630
Wow… listening to this it almost sounds like you’re talking about something

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:21.230
more than just fruit

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:25.540
That depends on how the listener interprets it

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:28.180
But one thing researchers are certain about

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:31.240
the taste of a fully grown, large peach

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:33.240
is something people never forget

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:37.290
no matter how long it’s been

00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:19.540
Hey, why are you smiling to yourself?

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.970
What’s up with you?

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.810
Nothing, man. I was just thinking about something

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.910
Hey you’re smiling again

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:42.400
What’s wrong with you?

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.740
What’s wrong with me?

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:48.380
So

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:49.740
what made you

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:51.190
come see me at the shop today?

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.800
I want to rent your place for an exhibition

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.640
Both floors

00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.040
When are you free?

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.870
Finally, huh?

00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:04.270
You kept me waiting

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:06.020
Things like this

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:08.530
Shouldn’t I wait for a bit of inspiration?

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:10.800
Inspiration?

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.640
‘inspiration’

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:13.950
So what is this?

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.060
A lot of things, man

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:23.400
can I ask you something?

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:25.200
Yeah?

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:28.300
Do you really like peaches?

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:31.410
Or are you just using them as a comparison for your partners?

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:34.240
Both, actually.

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:35.930
What about you?

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:37.930
Have you ever had a peach?

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.000
Not yet

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:42.460
Then you really should

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:44.590
They’re fragrant

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:45.420
Sweet

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:47.050
and super juicy.

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:51.140
It’s the flavor and the feeling that I really love

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:56.800
you’re making me want one right now.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:58.960
If you were me

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.710
you’d have tried it by now

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:04.090
Uh…

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:05.780
Huh?

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:06.880
You seriously didn’t know?

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:09.639
Know what?

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:12.690
When I eat a peach

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:14.920
and when I eat you

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:17.179
the taste is exactly the same

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:19.230
Sweet

00:34:19.489 --> 00:34:20.250
Fragrant

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:21.850
I can’t stop

00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:25.610
So…

00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:27.330
I’ll use that as my exhibition title

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:30.810
Which one?

00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:36.350
Peach Lover

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:38.780
Of course

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:40.000
why not?

00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:41.880
Just hearing the name

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:43.880
already makes me want to go

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:55.350
Hey

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:56.540
Hey!

00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:58.650
Hey!!?

00:34:58.650 --> 00:34:59.380
What?

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:01.020
Are you even listening to me?

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:02.120
You’re zoning out again

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:04.180
Just say it

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:06.330
What’s wrong with you?

00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:07.760
You’re not usually like this.

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:10.500
Nothing’s wrong

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:12.940
You can lie to anyone, Po

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:14.510
but not to me

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.180
I’ve known you for years

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:18.240
You don’t usually space out like this

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:20.000
You don’t sit there smiling to yourself

00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:21.050
What’s wrong with you?

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:27.370
What do you want me to do about it?

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:32.060
I think…

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.340
You are

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.170
in love

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:40.830
Oh

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:43.000
You’re talking crazy

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:43.870
Damn, why’d you hit me so hard

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:45.660
Just think, dude

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:47.240
How many things

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:48.710
can really inspire someone

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:50.660
this much?

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:52.660
You’re smiling to yourself

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:54.390
thinking about him

00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:59.050
Come here

00:35:59.050 --> 00:35:59.780
Show me his picture

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:00.600
That’s enough

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:01.550
I wanna see it

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:02.570
Stop talking nonsense

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:03.690
I wanna see

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:04.860
I don’t have one

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:07.810
Fine. Then you don’t

00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:09.240
But when you’ve got problems

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.130
don’t come running to me

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:17.680
Uh…

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:20.000
Can I ask you something?

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.150
Yeah

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:23.600
What if one day

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:25.510
a sex tape of mine got leake

00:36:26.770 --> 00:36:28.280
would you still be my friend?

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:30.000
A sex tape?

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:33.170
Who the hell did you sleep with?

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:35.430
I’m just asking

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:36.640
would you still be my friend?

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:37.400
Dude

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.460
who did you sleep with?

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.420
Meen , listen to me

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:43.080
Who did you sleep with?

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:48.920
Man, your place...

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:49.580
and...

00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:50.950
so many flies

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:52.680
You let him film you?

00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:56.200
So

00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:57.670
when’s the place free?

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:00.240
Don’t change the subject

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:02.530
You wanna be a porn star?

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:05.570
What the hell did you record?

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:09.190
Let me sum it up for you

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.770
You slept with someone

00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:14.050
You let him film you

00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:15.610
And now you wanna be a porn star

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:17.560
Po

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:21.120
Can I ask you something?

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:23.130
You can do whatever you want

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:25.490
but don’t do this just to spite your dad, okay?

00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:30.590
My dad

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:32.230
If he died

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:34.040
I wouldn’t even go to his funeral

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:39.350
Why the hell would I be doing this out of spite?

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:46.930
uh..

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:55.610
So

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:57.410
you’re treating me to everything, right

00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:59.380
Of course

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:00.930
My best friend’s here

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:04.100
You’re adorable, man

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:06.720
You take care of me like we’re married

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:38.960
Hello

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:40.850
You

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:45.260
I miss you so much

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:50.000
I miss you too

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:53.800
You

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:57.270
Do you want to stay over at my place tonight?

00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:00.210
I’ll be working late

00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:02.520
You can sleep first

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.790
Okay

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:07.050
Good luck

00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:08.870
Uh..

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:10.380
Okay

00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:45.930
Hello

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:47.250
What would you like?

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.470
I’ll have…

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:50.760
an espresso, please.

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:52.520
One espresso?

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:54.700
Sure

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.200
Please wait a moment

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:13.130
Here you go

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:14.400
One espresso

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:16.870
I made it strong

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:18.380
Take it slow

00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:19.680
It might be a bit bitter

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:29.740
The coffee here

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:30.660
smells really good

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:34.200
So…

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:36.350
the coffee

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:39.740
or me?

00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:58.440
I was just kidding

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:01.330
Next time, you should try a latte

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:03.850
You might like it more than an espresso

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:07.820
It’s less bitter

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:43.730
Sit

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:44.830
Give me your hand

00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:46.440
Hand

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:53.840
Sit

00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:06.200
Excuse me

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:22.660
Are you

00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:24.030
going to keep sitting in front of the shop for long?

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:27.300
Uh…

00:43:27.930 --> 00:43:29.090
I didn’t mean it

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:47.240
You’re kind of strict.

00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:48.880
Hey…

00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:50.480
I was just joking

00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:07.980
You’re

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:10.390
still here?

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:23.040
That’s cute

00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:10.540
hey you

00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:15.990
Didn’t you say you’d be working late today?

00:45:16.570 --> 00:45:17.490
I thought...

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:19.260
you weren’t coming

00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:21.140
It’s just that…

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:22.950
the director’s wife is about to give birth

00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:25.040
So they wrapped up the shoot early

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:28.310
Where are you off to?

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:31.620
Minimart?

00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:34.390
farther than that

00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:37.680
I was thinking of getting something to eat near the indie theater.

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:40.530
I never been there

00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:43.820
Is there anything good around there?

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:48.900
I’m not really sure

00:45:51.110 --> 00:45:51.890
But…

00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:54.890
around here

00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:00.980
I’m the highlight

00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:48.210
So

00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:50.000
I’m asking

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.120
what’s good around there?

00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:54.010
Uh…

00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:55.750
There are lots of things

00:46:57.010 --> 00:46:58.100
Mostly

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.490
cheap street food

00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:04.240
But…

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:12.050
you probably can’t go with me, right?

00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:19.140
Why not?

00:47:19.390 --> 00:47:20.010
Hmm?

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:23.800
Actors are just people

00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:29.250
Sometimes

00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:32.770
I just want good food

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:36.610
I mean…

00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:40.000
if we go together

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.120
and someone sees us

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:42.990
So

00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:46.500
I don’t think we’d be able to eat in peace

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:50.850
and also

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:53.490
if any photos got out

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:57.940
what would you tell your family?

00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:21.790
Follow me

00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:26.420
Where are we going?

00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:27.910
Hey

00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:29.050
Are we switching from dinner

00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:30.000
to something else now?

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:30.940
Hmm?

00:50:22.130 --> 00:50:23.550
What are you doing?

00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:28.230
That’s nice

00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:34.790
Hey

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:37.980
are you sleepy?

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:40.970
No.

00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:44.200
I’m just resting my eyes

00:50:45.310 --> 00:50:46.800
If you’re tired

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:49.580
you can rest first

00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:50.420
I’ll buy something and bring it back for you

00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:53.160
No

00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:57.640
I want to go with you

00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:00.290
Then

00:51:00.970 --> 00:51:02.440
change your clothes quickly

00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:03.440
So we can go

00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:04.990
Here

00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:09.620
You want me to disguise myself?

00:51:10.890 --> 00:51:12.290
And most importantly

00:51:14.290 --> 00:51:15.460
wear a mask

00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:30.870
Hey

00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:33.090
What are you doing?

00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:35.410
I’m getting changed

00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:37.600
So we can go soon

00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:39.060
Uh...

00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:03.070
Let me help you

00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:47.420
I’m really falling for you

00:52:51.570 --> 00:52:53.220
How about we do something first?

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:54.010
Hmm?

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.580
Let’s go eat first

00:54:49.690 --> 00:54:50.990
Please don’t leave, Ton

00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:52.410
Let me go

00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:53.830
I’ll handle this on my own

00:54:53.830 --> 00:54:54.620
No!

00:54:58.350 --> 00:54:59.610
I want you to remember this

00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:02.980
you’ve ruined my life

00:55:04.290 --> 00:55:05.250
Lek

00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:08.060
You’ve killed me inside

00:55:38.550 --> 00:55:40.320
Hello

00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:41.960
Tonight, on Inside the Human Heart

00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:44.200
I’d like to talk with you about something

00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:46.810
we don’t usually talk about very often

00:55:47.970 --> 00:55:48.910
Love

00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:51.120
and sexual orientation

00:55:51.970 --> 00:55:53.530
which vary from person to person

00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:57.000
And it’s not abnormal the way many people think

00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:00.410
From a psychological perspective

00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:02.550
attraction between men

00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:04.740
or between women,

00:56:05.530 --> 00:56:07.070
It’s not a matter of choice

00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:09.030
but it’s about chemistry

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.730
and the heart’s true nature

00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:14.140
Like a scent

00:56:15.090 --> 00:56:16.490
that makes your heart race

00:56:17.230 --> 00:56:19.310
without you knowing why

00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:23.890
Love between two men

00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:26.970
is no different from any other kind of love

00:56:27.810 --> 00:56:29.620
It has doub

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.190
fear

00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:32.840
sweetness

00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:35.830
and the same questions in the heart

00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:37.870
Sometimes,

00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:39.690
sexual orientation

00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:42.610
or what makes us feel safe

00:56:43.550 --> 00:56:45.110
doesn’t come from sexual desire

00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:48.100
it comes from experiences in childhood

00:56:48.890 --> 00:56:50.590
Some people crave warmth

00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:53.730
A need to be seen

00:56:54.570 --> 00:56:56.680
Some just want to feel valued

00:56:57.840 --> 00:56:59.370
by someone

00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:02.900
This isn’t wrong

00:57:03.590 --> 00:57:05.690
It’s how the human heart works

00:57:06.690 --> 00:57:08.020
wanting love

00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:10.410
in a way that makes us feel at ease

00:57:11.250 --> 00:57:13.660
being who we truly are

00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:17.650
When attraction begins

00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:20.390
the body releases different chemicals

00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:22.370
Dopamine

00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:24.020
Oxytocin

00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:25.850
Serotonin

00:57:26.790 --> 00:57:28.580
These chemicals make our hearts race

00:57:29.370 --> 00:57:30.490
our hands shake

00:57:31.590 --> 00:57:33.190
or make you smile without noticing

00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:35.570
It’s just natural chemistry

00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:37.410
It doesn’t matter what gender you are

00:57:37.930 --> 00:57:38.990
or who you’re in love with

00:57:41.350 --> 00:57:43.140
It is the language of the heart

00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:46.610
spoken before the mind has time to think

00:57:47.450 --> 00:57:48.620
And in the end

00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:51.220
love, in any form

00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:52.540
Whether it’s man and man

00:57:52.850 --> 00:57:53.810
man and woman

00:57:54.290 --> 00:57:55.470
or anyone with anyone

00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:57.470
they all hold equal value

00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:00.710
As long as the love creates a safe space

00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:03.200
and gives us the courage to be seen

00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:06.040
for who we truly are.

00:58:12.350 --> 00:58:13.790
You are listening to

00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:16.190
The Art of Meaning Scene

00:58:16.830 --> 00:58:18.710
the art of being seen

00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:19.580
by someone

00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:21.580
May your heart

00:58:22.210 --> 00:58:24.550
find gentle rest tonight

00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:39.000
Sasom

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.300
your father would like to see you.

00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:41.870
If you become the brand ambassador

00:58:42.190 --> 00:58:44.450
I’ll give you Tonnam's address

00:58:44.450 --> 00:58:45.670
If you don’t agree

00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:48.930
You’ll never see him till you die

00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:51.240
What the hell is this about, Lek?

00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:53.230
Do you get it now?

00:58:54.070 --> 00:58:56.690
why I need Peach Lover as a safe place?

00:58:57.320 --> 00:58:59.580
Can I help you with anything?

00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:02.010
Call me DADDY!
