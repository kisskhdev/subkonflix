[Ordinary people on the front line
of anti-poaching efforts in Bolamula]

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.060
Officer Bai.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.410
It's great to be young.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.500
Isn't it?

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.260
It reminds me of my younger days,

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.290
studying at the Sports Institute.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.000
Mr. Meng, you went from a sports student

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.600
to the coal mining industry.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.280
That's quite a leap.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.570
What are you laughing at?

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.329
I just thought

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.060
you didn't seem much like a cop.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.050
But then your cop side

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.910
came out again.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.260
What do you mean "like a cop"?

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:08.990
I am a cop.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.230
What made you think

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.490
I didn't seem like one?

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.800
It shows.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.430
Your thoughts are written
all over your face.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.590
Then do you know

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.190
what I'm thinking

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.150
right now?

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.710
You're thinking about

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.360
Duojie's pasture.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.340
You're exactly

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.020
like what Bai Chun described.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:33.990
Did he say I'd come find you

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.020
because of the pasture?

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.750
No.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:36.990
He said you're impatient

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.079
and straightforward.

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.980
Seems like he was right.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.520
You don't beat around the bush at all.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:05.970
I'm not going back.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.810
Go back yourself if you want.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.440
I'm not going anywhere.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.500
It's comfortable living here.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.130
It's just going back to the city

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.180
for a few days.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.339
I've arranged everything.

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.690
Sangba will pick you up tomorrow.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.930
The pasture hasn't been

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.180
peaceful lately.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.310
I'm worried someone might cause trouble.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.950
Did you get into a fight again?

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.280
That's the fifth time this month.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.130
You just have nothing to do at home.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.680
Do a job for me tomorrow.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.170
Herd ten sheep to the Mountain Patrol.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.980
You just want the sheep and I

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.409
to stay there, don't you?

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.700
How did you know?

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:52.300
I told your mom

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.409
not to tell you yet.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:55.780
Dad.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.320
I stopped fighting a long time ago.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.950
There's a dispute on this pasture.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.250
Someone wants us to move out.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.370
We might not be able to protect it.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.870
Then let me stay.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.190
We lost him.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.180
We can't lose

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.290
his pasture.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:41.270
Dad.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.140
I didn't expect you to ride so well,
Mr. Meng.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.160
I didn't expect

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.080
you wouldn't go easy on me at all.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.390
I did go easy on you.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:15.560
I admit defeat.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.240
Do you ride often?

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.060
I used to.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.010
But after moving to the city,

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.800
I rode less.

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:33.360
I've always wanted to bring my kid

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.200
to ride horses,

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.810
but they're not interested.

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:37.560
Boy or girl?

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.159
Girl.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.470
She's ten years old this year.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:42.830
When I was her age,

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.300
I was already a good rider.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:45.390
I'd go out with my classmates

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:46.450
to pick up yak dung.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.630
There was no heating back then.

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.090
Yak dung was our treasure.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.220
When I was young,

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.620
Grandma told me

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.659
that yak dung has over 60 names.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.120
I realized

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:58.450
their love for yak dung

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:59.060
is different

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.000
from ours.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.240
They cherish yak dung

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.420
not just because

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.670
it provides heat,

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.840
but out of

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.130
respect to the nature.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:10.500
Let alone yak dung,

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:12.130
even a stone

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.190
on the grassland

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.150
is precious

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.100
in their eyes.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.210
It can't be moved casually.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:19.070
Because

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.720
it doesn't belong to anyone.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.360
They are part

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:24.060
of nature.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.120
But Tibetans

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.000
also use stones

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.930
to build houses.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:39.830
I know

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.930
the story of County Mayor Duojie.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.100
and what your Mountain Patrol

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.500
did in Bolamula.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.080
That’s why

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:47.780
I think you guys are heroes.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:49.850
Because you are

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.940
going against nature.

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:57.880
We aren't going against it.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:07:59.870
We are protecting it.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.390
I don't mean nature,

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:04.480
but an

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:06.560
unchangeable trend.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.690
Development is the trend.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.250
We are all part of it.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:12.910
This isn't something

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:14.170
one person can decide.

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:17.430
I think

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.450
we still held onto

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:20.240
something.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.190
This is

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.920
the result of our persistence.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:25.480
If we hadn't

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.140
been so persistent back then,

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:28.750
Bolamula would have already

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:30.450
become a large mining base.

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:34.860
Officer Bai,

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.059
I know for you,

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.030
this place has a different meaning.

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:41.830
This is Duojie's pasture.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:42.720
That's why you tried so hard

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.100
to save this place.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:46.080
But,

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:49.030
have you misunderstood something?

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.310
Although I said you are heroes,

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:53.830
that's a separate matter.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.420
I am a business person.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:57.630
My first priority is

00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:58.850
Xinhai's interests.

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:06.110
You want to talk about interests?

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.240
Then let me ask you a question.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:09.530
Why didn't Chenlong

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:10.660
develop this place?

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:13.150
What do you think?

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.390
Chenlong's operators

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.510
aren't fools.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.270
The contract has a term limit.

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:19.410
Of course, they're looking for the pasture

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:20.860
with the highest development value

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.150
to start construction on.

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:22.940
But this pasture

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:23.580
has been put on hold for so long

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.980
without being put to use.

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:26.360
The reason is simply that

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.220
it's not cost-effective enough.

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:29.920
You should know this

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:31.750
better than I do.

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:36.170
I know

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.060
you were given a task by your boss.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.530
But even as a layman

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:41.330
in the coal mining industry,

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.060
I feel this deal isn't worth it.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:45.290
I wonder, President Meng,

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.460
what do you think?

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:56.030
Even if

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:57.780
you complete the acquisition,

00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:59.410
for you personally,

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.540
will taking back such a piece of pasture

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:03.480
really bring you

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.810
significant benefits?

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.000
All done.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.830
Highland barley pizza.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.320
I invented it myself.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:25.940
It's delicious.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:27.860
I added highland barley,

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.160
butter, and yak meat.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:32.670
Let me cut it for you.

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:40.150
Okay.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:41.330
Zhacuo,

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:42.620
could I trouble you

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.750
to toast this for me?

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.280
Go and toast it.

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:49.050
Okay.

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:50.080
Okay.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.010
President Meng,

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.270
I still hope

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:05.170
you can give up on acquiring

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:05.970
this pasture.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.380
Let's take a step back.

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:12.820
Even if you do acquire it,

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.050
at best,

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.700
you'll just use it to pile up coal slag.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.050
Xinhai's bid

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:18.150
isn't something

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:19.510
you can easily match, right?

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:20.370
What do you say?

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:24.440
Okay, it's toasted.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:25.550
Thank you.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.010
You toasted it so quickly.

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:28.830
Was it fast?

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.790
It's nothing.

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:43.000
No need.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:44.860
This time,

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.720
the favour you owe me

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.870
will also be hard to repay.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:57.910
It smells good.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:59.730
Aren't you eating?

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.620
It feels like after all these years,

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:10.670
this plain bun

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:11.960
still tastes the same.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:15.530
It's tasty.

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:19.170
Mr. Meng,

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.080
do you mean

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:24.820
you won't acquire it?

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.220
Officer Bai,

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.260
are we now

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:33.700
officially acquainted?

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:43.320
I told you last time.

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:45.260
Call me Bai Ju.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:49.440
Bai Ju.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:51.670
Mr. Meng.

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:33.980
I wore the prettiest dress

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.620
and walked down the corridor.

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:38.550
Dad took a photo of me to check in.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.120
I hope Mom, Dad, and I

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.690
can always be like little yellow ducks,

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:49.240
floating on the water,

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:50.490
and never sinking.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:53.960
A red double-decker bus.

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.150
Sitting in the front row
on the upper deck.

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:58.510
That way, we can tour

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:00.240
the whole provincial capital.

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:02.440
Maybe

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.170
we can see the road

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:05.380
Dad takes to work.

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:38.200
You...

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:39.630
Shao Zhuling, what are you doing?

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:40.600
Why aren't you sleeping?

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.410
You scared me.

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:43.800
You're the scary one, okay?

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:46.380
Crouched by the bedside
late at night.

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.360
I was afraid you'd catch a cold.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.620
So I was tucking you in.

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:51.410
What are you doing?

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:53.040
Acting in a TV drama?

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:55.240
You're my daughter.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.390
Can't I touch you?

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:57.350
Do you know

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.550
you have a heavy hand?

00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:59.670
You woke me up.

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:03.860
Liar.

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:06.270
You weren't asleep at all.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.170
Mom.

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:11.530
Your date today...

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:13.170
why did it take so long?

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.820
I've been waiting for you.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:16.960
Don't listen to your grandma.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.500
I didn't go on a date.

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:21.660
Why were you waiting for me?

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.140
Teach me how to fight.

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:26.750
I mean self-defense.

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:29.190
Why do you want to learn self-defense?

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:30.520
What else is it for?

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:31.550
To defend myself.

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:36.830
Okay.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.090
I'll show you a thing or two.

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:41.410
Self-defense.

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:43.370
First, poke the eyes.

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:44.490
-Poke the eyes.
-Kick the leg.

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:45.220
Kick the leg.

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:46.670
Right. Do it again for me.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.650
Poke the eyes, kick the leg.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:51.180
Poke the eyes, kick the leg.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.460
Poke the eyes, kick the leg.

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:53.500
Alright, alright.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:54.430
Stop kicking.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.710
Good job, sweetie.

00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:58.170
You kicked really high.

00:15:59.220 --> 00:15:59.750
Alright,

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:00.720
go to sleep now.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:03.480
Sleep.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.360
Scoot over.

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:06.780
You're pushing me off.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:15.220
Mom.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.440
Do you like that uncle?

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:32.390
Then do you like the big city?

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.840
Did your dad tell you?

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:46.820
A little bit.

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:54.500
So what do you think?

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.680
Dad says

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:00.430
the provincial capital is great.

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:05.569
But I still want to

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:06.680
stay with you.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:49.960
Assistant Bai.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:51.240
Are you busy?

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.630
You scared me.

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:55.300
What did you call me?

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:56.190
Come on,

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:57.900
stop pretending.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:00.740
Meng Yaohui is transferring you
to the Group

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:02.510
to be the General Manager's assistant.

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:04.420
Everyone knows about it.

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.380
What are you talking about?

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:07.910
Nothing is set in stone yet.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.140
Mr. Meng has been swamped lately.

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:11.140
He asked me to come learn the ropes,

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:12.940
and take some of the load off him.

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:14.610
If you ask me,

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:17.950
it's really meaningless.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.790
Being a manager at the mine,

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:23.720
at least makes you
an independent legal entity.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:24.980
Running your own show.

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:27.000
is much freer

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:28.770
than begging for scraps behind him.

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:30.300
It sounds impressive, too.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:31.570
At least it's a...

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:32.730
"Chief" title.

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:35.450
Being an assistant...

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:37.140
It's a step backward.

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.940
What is your purpose here?

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:42.620
I'm not looking for you.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.200
I'm looking for your boss.

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:45.730
Where is Meng Yaohui?

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:47.550
He went out on business.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:49.620
What for?

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.700
What a question.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:51.500
Does he have to report to me

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:52.760
about what he's doing?

00:18:58.770 --> 00:18:59.160
Wu.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.270
Wu, put that down.

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:00.700
Wu.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.240
I want to learn a thing or two too.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:04.790
I also want to be an assistant.

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:05.610
Put it down, Wu.

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:06.440
Manager Bai!

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:07.260
Manager Bai!

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:08.540
The blaster and the coal mining team

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:08.920
are fighting!

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:09.920
You'd better go take a look.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.740
What happened?

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:11.180
The mining team thinks

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:12.140
the blasting holes

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:13.250
are too close to their equipment.

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:13.760
But Yu

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:14.680
refuses to change position,

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.750
so the two sides started scuffling.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:16.550
Go take a look.

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:19.580
Aren't... aren't you leaving?

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:20.550
You go ahead.

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:21.830
I'll stay here

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:22.830
and wait for Meng.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:24.060
Let's go.

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.300
[Western Evening News]

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:35.660
Tianduo Mayor Wang's secretary

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.040
called me personally.

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.090
He spoke very highly

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:39.310
of your report.

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:40.240
No, no.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.120
You flatter me, sir.

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:43.790
People like me,

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:45.270
always choose topics

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:46.980
that interest us.

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:48.610
I always cause trouble for the paper,

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:49.140
and in the end,

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:50.670
I rely on you to cover for me.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.590
I know that.

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:52.830
Why are you

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:54.160
criticizing yourself?

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:55.880
What trouble have you caused now?

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:56.480
No, no, no.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.740
I'm just being honest.

00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:58.950
Just being honest.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.000
You kid.

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:02.550
Here's the thing.

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.620
I've discussed it with the President.

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:05.380
You've been in the Investigation Office

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:06.750
for quite a few years.

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:08.460
Li is retiring
in the second half of the year.

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:09.760
We want you to take over

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:12.320
as the Director
of the Investigation Office.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.380
No...

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:14.550
That... that's not right.

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:16.140
It's really not right, Chief.

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:17.530
There's nothing wrong with it.

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:18.960
In terms of seniority and ability,

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.420
this position should be yours.

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:20.980
No, it's just...

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.260
I can't handle it.

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:24.140
I really can't.

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:25.590
Ever since I started working,

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:26.970
I've been out in the field.

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:28.770
I take creative leave by months.

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:29.590
I've barely ever sat

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:31.160
in this office.

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:32.670
What's so hard about that?

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:34.550
From now on, you'll be stationed
at headquarters.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:36.250
Let your subordinates
handle the field missions.

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:36.980
Help the agency

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:38.380
train some new recruits.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:49.520
Did you get told off?

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:53.480
Look at that face.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.140
It's obviously nothing good.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:58.430
I'm getting a promotion

00:20:58.980 --> 00:20:59.740
and will be your boss.

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:00.870
Is that a good thing?

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:01.910
No.

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:04.870
When an eagle gets old,

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:06.090
it gets locked in a cage

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:07.510
to learn how to squawk like a parrot.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:09.040
Do you think that will work?

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:11.770
Why do you have such a sharp tongue?

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:12.570
The Editor-in-Chief

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:13.790
meant well.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:15.500
You think this is sharp?

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:15.940
You've handled

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:17.000
much worse from me.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:19.000
By the way,

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.400
your phone rang just now.

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:21.990
I think it's a good thing.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:33.860
Hello?

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.180
I didn't hear it ringing.

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:35.740
Go ahead.

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:37.960
Come over when you have time.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.740
Regarding Lingling's schooling,

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:40.950
we need to discuss it further.

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:41.560
Captain.

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:42.240
Let's go.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:43.180
Okay.

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:44.310
Sure, sure.

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:45.220
-Well…
-That’s it.

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.950
I'll buy the cake from last time

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:49.750
for Lingling again.

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:50.500
Buy another one for me.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.160
I'm going to ask the Editor-in-Chief
for leave.

00:21:58.550 --> 00:21:59.210
If Lingling

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.950
transfers to a school
in the provincial capital,

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:03.420
what are your plans?

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:05.940
Here's what I think.

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:06.550
Since she

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:08.290
has one year left of elementary school,

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:09.530
my suggestion is

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:10.740
that she transfers

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:11.960
after she graduates.

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:13.240
Otherwise,

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.390
once she gets to a new school

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:15.700
and adapts to the new environment,

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.520
she'll graduate
and start middle school right away.

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:18.890
She'll face another adjustment period.

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:19.820
For her,

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:21.440
that might not be a good thing.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:22.770
I really can't bear to leave

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:24.050
my good friends in my class.

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:24.770
Right?

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.150
In that case,

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:28.160
I'll also have time

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:28.870
to check out

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:29.850
the middle schools
in the provincial capital first.

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:30.770
We need to communicate in advance

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:31.620
which school

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:33.010
can accept her student file.

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:33.460
If she's going,

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:34.590
she should go to the best one,

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:35.220
right?

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:39.090
If I were to attend
a bottom-tier school there,

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:39.850
it would be better to stay here

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:40.560
and attend a key city school.

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.070
Better to be a big fish in a small pond.

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:42.530
I agree.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.420
We didn't collude on this.

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:49.600
There's no need.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:50.480
No.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.010
What about the child's
living arrangements?

00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:58.700
As for living arrangements,

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.230
that's even less of a worry.

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:01.640
Her grandparents

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.700
have been complaining to me every day

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:03.590
since they retired

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:04.810
that they don't get to see Lingling.

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:06.350
They're hoping she can move there.

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:07.650
They have endless energy

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:08.590
and are more than willing
to take care of her.

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:10.200
I wasn't asking about the elderly.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.060
I meant,

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:13.280
what are your personal plans?

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:21.220
If Lingling goes to
the provincial capital,

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.220
I won't be doing field work anymore.

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:26.550
That's great.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.510
Shao is getting promoted.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:29.570
-Mom.
-I…

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.380
Don't listen to his nonsense.

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:31.940
I could say

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:33.440
pretty words like that too.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.950
It's really not just pretty words.

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:36.830
The chief editor just talked to me.

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:39.160
He wants to promote me
to Director of the Investigation Office.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.420
I haven't said yes yet.

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:42.310
If Lingling comes
to the provincial capital,

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:43.970
then I won't need to hesitate.

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:45.390
Right, Mom?

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:03.190
Let's do that then.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.180
From now on,

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.990
we'll rent a place near the school

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:08.590
and I'll go keep her company.

00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:09.330
Mom,

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:11.080
you're coming with me too?

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:13.650
I'm telling you in advance,

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:15.170
if you want to go to those

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.180
sightseeing corridors

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:16.960
or viral spots in the capital,

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:17.820
go ask your dad.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.590
I'm not going with you, okay?

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:20.770
So, is there anything

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:21.600
I can do to help?

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:22.240
Like writing

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.640
a transfer application for you?

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.330
You think you're the only one
who can write?

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:26.090
Shao,

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:27.030
come here.

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:28.300
Help me bring out

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.320
that plate of fruit.

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.250
Sure thing, Mom.

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:31.420
Who's your mom?

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:32.410
I'll go.

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:35.610
Let's keep our accounts separate.

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:37.360
We mother and daughter
are a separate matter.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:37.850
Shao,

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:38.590
come have dinner

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:39.500
here tonight.

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:40.810
I'm making lamb dumplings.

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:42.180
I'm going to buy some meat.

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:42.700
No, don't.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:43.550
I... I'll go buy it.

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:44.050
Come, Lingling.

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:44.850
Come with Dad.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:45.960
There's also a cake

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:47.180
that I left in the car.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:48.030
-We’re going.
-Isn’t the cake

00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:49.310
really hard to order?

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:50.840
I reserved it.

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:52.100
How else could I get it?

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:53.430
Save a bite for me later.

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:07.060
Have you really thought this through?

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:09.040
I'll see how he behaves first.

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:12.710
If you two can

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.780
compromise for the child,

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.150
he stops doing field work,

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:18.480
and you transfer
to the provincial capital.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.480
So that during Lingling's childhood,

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:21.940
both parents are present.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.960
That would be good for the child.

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:26.000
But back then, you

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:28.060
raised the four of us all by yourself.

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:28.590
Aren't we

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:29.550
doing fine now?

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:33.260
That's just what you think.

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:35.640
But have you ever thought about

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:36.860
whether I was fine?

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:42.770
It's because

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:44.140
I know that feeling,

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:45.740
that I don't want you

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.020
to go through it again.

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:54.040
Do you think there's still a chance

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.500
for you and Shao?

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:57.610
Mom.

00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:58.500
This isn't like when

00:25:58.500 --> 00:25:59.830
you made me go on blind dates.

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:01.070
Whose side are you on?

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:01.820
Of course,

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:03.290
I'm on your side.

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:05.070
I just want you to be happy.

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:05.980
Here we go again.

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:07.500
I'll go help you with the dough.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:08.740
Talk to me properly.

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:10.880
Tell me,

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:12.610
can you and Shao

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:14.990
make the broken mirror whole again?

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:15.650
Mom.

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:17.550
There is no such thing

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:19.000
as making a broken mirror whole.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:19.860
A broken mirror

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:21.270
cannot be made whole.

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:23.050
Don't be so absolute.

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:23.970
How do you know

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000
it's impossible?

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.640
The so-called "broken mirror made whole"

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.140
is just an illusion.

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.750
It comes down to three scenarios:

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:30.550
either

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:31.680
it was never broken,

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:32.290
or

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.530
there was no mirror,

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:34.290
or

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:35.750
it was never made whole.

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:36.660
Which scenario do you think

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:37.990
Shao Yunfei and I are in?

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:45.640
And then?

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.180
What did you say then?

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.140
What could I say?

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:51.460
That tongue twister of hers

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.060
completely confused me

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:54.060
right on the spot.

00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:57.030
Bai Ju has been extraordinary

00:26:57.030 --> 00:26:58.500
since she was a child.

00:26:58.590 --> 00:26:59.440
She can shoot

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:00.980
and enter the Uninhabited Zone.

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:01.850
Now,

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.400
she has a good head on her shoulders.

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.310
In relationships,

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:05.550
she never gets the short end of the stick.

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:06.950
She's not easily fooled.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:07.760
She just

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:09.290
has a sharp tongue,

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:11.940
but her heart is softer than anyone's.

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:14.000
Sometimes,

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:15.480
ignorance is bliss.

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:17.070
Even if she's a bit muddled,

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:18.800
she manages to live a good life.

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.030
Children have their own destinies.

00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:22.880
Right now,

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.740
we can't help with anything anymore.

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:25.880
Even if we give advice,

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.160
they might not listen.

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:29.810
We just need to

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:30.970
stay healthy

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:32.530
and not be a burden to the kids.

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:33.390
That's enough.

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.190
That makes sense.

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:36.420
But

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:38.730
about things that don't matter,

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:40.260
I haven't worried any less.

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:43.740
Lin is back.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.710
No wonder the whole hallway

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.200
smells like moxibustion.

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:49.740
What are you chatting about?

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.170
Zhang said

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.900
Bai Ju is being transferred
to the provincial capital.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:55.030
That's a good thing.

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:56.460
Didn't Shi Long

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:57.440
want to promote her

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.380
a long time ago?

00:27:58.500 --> 00:27:59.530
She didn't agree.

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:00.270
Why

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:01.110
did she suddenly

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:01.940
come around?

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:03.000
It was her friends

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.070
from the Mountain Patrol,

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.440
whose words carry weight.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.570
They persuaded her.

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:09.140
Plus,

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:10.830
Duojie's pasture

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:12.070
was saved recently.

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:14.030
And that put her mind at ease.

00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:14.890
So she thought

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:16.350
she'd take a step forward.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.180
What happened

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.120
to Duojie's pasture?

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:22.510
You don't know?

00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:58.900
Zhacuo.

00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:00.030
County Mayor Lin,

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:03.110
Director Zhang,

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:04.750
Ms. Zhu.

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:06.140
Why are you here?

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:07.610
Zhacuo,

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:08.980
everyone misses

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.300
your beef noodles.

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:11.730
Do you welcome us?

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:12.850
Welcome.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:13.740
Of course.

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:15.530
Ms. Zhu,

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:17.920
you came all this way personally.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:20.270
Did my little rascal

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.030
cause trouble at school again?

00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:23.510
Zhacuo's Dad,

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:24.570
he's doing great.

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:26.170
He's first in every subject.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.810
If he goes a day without fighting,

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:30.590
I thank the heavens.

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:31.490
Here.

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:32.870
Cover up.

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.110
Thank you, Ms. Kang.

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:37.310
Riga,

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:39.110
you're looking well.

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:41.220
Hello, Riga.

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:46.280
Dad,

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:47.900
didn't you keep talking about

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:48.860
County Mayor Lin?

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:50.790
County Mayor Lin is here to see you.

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:54.030
Traitor.

00:29:58.330 --> 00:29:59.250
This old man.

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:01.360
He thinks everyone is County Mayor Lin.

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:02.210
Now that you're actually here,

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:03.550
he doesn't recognize you.

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:04.890
I won't sell

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.030
my Cordyceps to you.

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:07.640
Okay.

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:08.610
Okay.

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:09.680
It seems

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:11.170
I need to visit more often.

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:12.990
Please, come in.

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:33.440
Manager Bai,

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.560
you were looking for me?

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:35.250
I remember I had

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:36.180
a Chenlong contract here.

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:37.290
Did you give it to Mr. Meng?

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:37.960
No.

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:38.790
The pasture acquisition documents,

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:40.120
I haven't touched them.

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:47.110
Wu, put that down.

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.590
Wu.

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:49.520
I want to learn too.

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:51.880
I also want to be an assistant.

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.620
Go get Director Wu.

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:56.010
He went out

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:56.600
and took a few people

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:57.930
from the security team.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:58.820
Where did he go?

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:01.780
Dad still

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:03.410
remembers County Mayor Lin.

00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:04.700
He always talks about

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:06.160
the animal husbandry tax.

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.460
He says County Mayor Lin on horseback

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:10.260
is the benefactor who cut taxes.

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:11.530
That wasn't

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:12.790
my achievement alone.

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:15.980
People from Xinhai came to see you?

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:17.220
How was it resolved?

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:18.250
Very well.

00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:20.520
Mr. Meng from Xinhai

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:21.740
is very reasonable.

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.290
I treated him to some buns.

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.450
Bai Ju kept hovering around

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:27.440
and bragging.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.940
He got dizzy from the talk

00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:31.240
and the food,

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:34.010
so he agreed not to take back the pasture.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:35.740
I heard

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:38.020
you bought a house in the city

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.400
and settled down.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:40.090
But all these years,

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:41.830
you've been guarding this place still.

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:43.030
It must be hard on you.

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.120
The outside world has changed too much.

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.260
I don't know how to do anything

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:49.720
but herd cattle and sheep.

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:50.980
Here,

00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:54.600
I can still guard the home
for the Captain.

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:59.260
Watching over the pasture every day,

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:02.200
I already feel very happy.

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:06.670
From now on,

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:07.690
we will

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:08.980
visit often.

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:10.980
If you need any help,

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:12.420
just let us know.

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:14.110
Thank you, Ms. Kang.

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:15.110
Yeah,

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:16.420
we still want to taste

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.020
what kind of bun is so magical

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:19.170
that it makes people

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:21.220
willingly change their minds
after eating it.

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:23.200
Then there's nothing good left to eat.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.240
Since you're here,

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.570
I definitely have to treat you

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:26.970
with something fancier.

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:29.880
I'll make highland barley pizza.

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:32.640
Highland barley pizza?

00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:37.150
What's that sound?

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:39.650
Construction trucks are here.

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:42.810
I'll go take a look.

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.420
Where are you from?

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:55.210
Why are you running over my pasture?

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.400
We are from the Xinhai Group.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.460
Sign the contract,

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:01.200
and we'll wire you the money immediately.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:01.980
Sign what?

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:03.500
You trampled the pasture

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:04.090
and even threatened me.

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:05.690
I'm going to call the police.

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:07.090
Whatever.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:08.960
This pasture of yours

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.310
belongs to Xinhai.

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.680
I'm here to take it back.

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:13.810
Whoever comes

00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:15.740
has to acknowledge this contract.

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:17.530
Mr. Meng already promised me

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:18.660
he wouldn't take it.

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:19.240
How can you

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:20.440
go back on your word?

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:21.850
What did he tell you?

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:22.550
He told me...

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:24.180
Whatever he told you is void.

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:27.580
I'm the one in charge now.

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:28.650
Sign the contract.

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:30.720
I'm not talking to you.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:31.850
I want to talk to Mr. Meng.

00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:33.580
I'm giving you two choices now.

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:35.110
One.

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:37.040
Sign the contract,

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:40.470
and you'll get every penny
of the relocation fee.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:41.570
Two.

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:44.380
I'll tear down the house for you.

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:45.710
Bring your cows

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:47.030
and get lost today.

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:49.120
The pasture is not mine.

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:50.270
If you keep this up...

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:50.940
If it's not yours,

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:52.480
why are you arguing with me?

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:54.170
Make a call.

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:55.780
Get the person in charge over here.

00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:57.180
I am the person in charge.

00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:05.320
What do you want to talk to me about?

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:11.469
This pasture isn't yours, is it?

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:13.230
I think at most

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:14.350
you can only say

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:16.090
"Tashi Delek."

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:18.429
The pasture belongs to my friend.

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:19.690
You can talk to me.

00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:20.719
Old man,

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:23.610
I advise you to stay away.

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:25.510
This is none of your business.

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:26.530
Don't get hurt later

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:28.070
and try to scam me.

00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:38.230
You're from Xinhai?

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:40.630
Yes.

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:42.360
Who is your supervisor?

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:43.980
Who allowed you

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.400
to make such a scene here?

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:49.150
Grandpa,

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:50.000
I advise you

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.030
to step aside.

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:51.900
If your family

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:53.030
had any strong connections,

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.500
I wouldn't be

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:54.699
standing here today.

00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:56.340
Guys.

00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:58.550
Get to work. Push.

00:34:58.940 --> 00:34:59.800
Don't you dare.

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:00.380
Move aside!

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:01.110
Don't fight!

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:02.230
Move!

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:03.380
Zhacuo! Zhacuo!

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:03.990
Get back!

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:04.830
Let go! Let go!

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:05.780
Back off!

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.870
Let go!

00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:08.020
-Move!
-Stop! Stop!

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:11.470
Chairman.

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:12.430
Why are you here?

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:18.460
Don't worry, Chairman.

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.300
I've arranged everything here.

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:23.010
Mayor Lin.

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:24.750
I'm late.

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:33.330
You are a bit late.

00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:36.730
Is this how

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:40.940
Xinhai's integration operations work?

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:43.670
Is this what you call

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:45.070
social responsibility?

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:48.140
I am terribly sorry.

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:49.850
It is my management failure.

00:35:49.850 --> 00:35:51.310
I'll handle it right away.

00:35:57.730 --> 00:35:58.930
You called them here.

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:06.560
Drive them back.

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:07.850
Okay.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:14.700
Who asked you to meddle?

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.510
Who gave you permission to go?

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:17.170
If it weren't for

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:18.760
Meng Yaohui telling me today,

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:19.650
about this matter,

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:20.550
how would you end it?

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:22.070
I'm asking you, how would you fix it?

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:23.900
Do you have a brain?

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:26.230
Why didn't you check before acting

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:27.630
whose pasture that was?

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.000
That belongs to Duojie,

00:36:29.590 --> 00:36:31.320
Lin Peisheng's old colleague.

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:33.260
Lin Peisheng,

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.030
the Vice Mayor of Tianduo.

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:36.430
You don't recognize him,

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:38.330
and even called him "Old Man"?

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.140
I think you are the one
acting like a big shot.

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:49.200
No one told me who he was.

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:51.590
He is the Mayor.

00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:53.070
He's on the news every day.

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.050
You're uneducated and don't read papers.

00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:56.580
Can't you at least watch TV?

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:00.380
Regarding the pasture integration,

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:02.240
why I didn't let you get involved,

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:03.680
don't you have a clue?

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.130
I was afraid you'd be brainless

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:10.460
and screw this up for me.

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:11.670
But you just rushed in

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:13.000
to cause trouble for me.

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:19.340
Chairman.

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:21.900
I handled it wrong.

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:24.730
I was just anxious

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:25.930
to share your burden.

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:28.760
Then regarding that piece of land,

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.290
how do you plan to handle it?

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:32.460
Handle what?

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.340
What is there to handle?

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:35.430
I want to handle you.

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:36.690
Can we touch that land?

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:38.570
That land is off-limits.

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:40.380
Idiot.

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:45.570
You...

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:47.780
even though you are the Vice President,

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:48.830
if it's not your business,

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:49.890
just stay out of it.

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.630
Yes.

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:52.100
Go back and handle the mess

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:53.250
at Mine No. 2.

00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:54.010
Yes.

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:55.130
If something like this

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:56.050
happens again,

00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.780
you...

00:37:57.350 --> 00:37:58.690
why don't you be the Chairman?

00:37:58.690 --> 00:37:59.550
Please, don't.

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:02.090
We wouldn't dare.

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:12.450
Hello?

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:15.940
Yes.

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:18.840
I've already taught him a lesson.

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:20.480
Don't worry.

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:22.090
I'll have someone

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:23.840
finalize the contract immediately.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:24.780
The old contract

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:25.550
is void.

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:27.820
No one will

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:28.880
bother them again.

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:30.850
[Kunlun Restaurant]

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:31.930
Tashi said

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:34.900
the pasture issue is resolved.

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:36.090
To thank everyone,

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:37.600
this meal is on him.

00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:39.510
So you're not the one paying.

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:41.110
It's just a meal.

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:42.510
No need to be this happy.

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:43.310
Spit it out.

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.010
What else?

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:46.280
Tashi also said,

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:47.970
to thank me,

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:49.470
he waived my

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.360
pasture contract fees for a year.

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:53.280
What did you do

00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:54.730
to get your fees waived?

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:56.730
If not for my buns,

00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:58.630
President Meng wouldn't have changed his mind.

00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:59.210
Right?

00:38:59.300 --> 00:38:59.940
Right.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:00.660
Come on.

00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:00.990
Yeah.

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:01.470
Come on.

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:02.070
Come on.

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:03.510
Let's have a drink.

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:03.920
Old Han.

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:04.400
Come on.

00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:09.570
Let's eat.

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:15.290
What are you doing?

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:44.230
About what happened before.

00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:46.160
You don't have to agree with me.

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.460
But

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.370
I'll keep doing it.

00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:52.820
If you cause trouble again,

00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:54.680
I'll arrest you again.

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:01.920
Thanks.

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:03.110
For what?

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:04.820
As for the pasture,

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:06.280
you don't need to thank me.

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:11.890
That pasture belongs to everyone.

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:13.360
Right.

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:15.540
It belongs to everyone.

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:18.380
Come on.

00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:20.350
To the pasture.

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:21.960
Cheers.

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:22.640
Come on.

00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:23.600
Come on, cheers.

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:25.300
To the pasture.

00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:27.480
To the pasture.

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:28.420
To the pasture.

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:29.140
Cheers.

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:38.750
Help yourself.

00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:46.730
When I was doing time,

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:47.940
during yard time,

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.190
guess who I met.

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:53.980
Weren't you

00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:55.100
with me every day?

00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:56.960
After six months,

00:40:57.110 --> 00:40:57.880
you and Zhacuo

00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:00.080
were transferred to the Second Prison.

00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:02.020
So, who did you see?

00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:04.790
Ma Yizhong.

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:05.760
Ma Yizhong.

00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:07.410
Why is it you again?

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:13.520
He recognized me

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:14.680
right away.

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:17.480
He ran up to me

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:20.470
and said one thing.

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:26.900
"You're getting what you deserve."

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:36.320
Then he just stared at me,

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:39.790
without saying another word.

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:41.460
Since then,

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:43.780
whenever we met,

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.130
he'd look at me from a distance,

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:49.360
shake his head, and walk away.

00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:53.090
That felt

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:57.420
worse than a beating.

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:06.190
At that time, I thought,

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:08.990
after I got out,

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.240
I had to find the Captain

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:13.460
and ask him

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:17.450
if what we did was right.

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:23.820
It's been 17 years.

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:26.520
From the airport to the county town,

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:29.990
I know every step by heart.

00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:33.810
I've been looking for him day and night.

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.480
Why can't I find Captain?

00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:46.660
Are you done searching?

00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:52.490
I should be done this year.

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:55.620
Didn't you say last year

00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:56.680
that you'd be done?

00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:02.660
I'm afraid if I finish this year,

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:05.540
I won't know

00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:06.860
what to do with myself.
