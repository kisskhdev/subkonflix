00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.020
(Be proactive and responsible.
Strive to be the best.)

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:57.810
Reporting, Ms. Xu.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.500
I've decided to marry
Comrade Fang Muyang.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.140
I'd like you to issue us
a letter of introduction

00:02:04.226 --> 00:02:05.530
for the marriage registration.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.060
You and Fang Muyang?

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.090
Ms. Xu, please don't misunderstand.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.300
Up until yesterday,

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.840
Comrade Fang Muyang and I

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.040
were purely comrades.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.670
Comrade Ye Feng
made me realize I shouldn't

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.340
aim above my station.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.690
It was he

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.500
who helped me see my place.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.530
He helped me understand

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.460
that Comrade Fang Muyang is
the one best suited to me.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.850
Fei, that's not quite right.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.410
In this new society,

00:02:41.448 --> 00:02:43.515
we don't talk about matching
family backgrounds.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.940
And there's no such thing

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.190
as reaching above your station.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.200
You young people,

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.180
when it comes to love,

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.130
you lack experience.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.250
If you take a wrong turn,

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.740
as long as you correct it in time,

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:57.870
you're still good comrades.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.420
In any case,

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.920
I hope you and Ye Feng

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.740
remain good colleagues

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.030
and good comrades.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:05.850
I understand.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.060
Ms. Xu,
about that letter of introduction…

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.826
Have you thought this through?

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.020
I have.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.800
All right.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.460
I'll issue it for you.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.020
(Jiangcheng Worker-Peasant Hospital)

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.250
We agreed to meet here. Where did he go?

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:38.690
Zhou.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.130
Where's Fang Muyang?

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:41.850
He went out early this morning.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:42.810
He hasn't come back.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.182
(China Famous Tea, Biluochun)

00:03:49.182 --> 00:03:50.293
Come, have some tea.

00:03:50.537 --> 00:03:51.340
Thank you, Mrs. Fei.

00:03:51.537 --> 00:03:53.248
Fang, why are you being so polite?

00:03:53.271 --> 00:03:54.410
It's enough that you came.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.850
And you even brought such fine tea.

00:03:56.226 --> 00:03:57.030
Don't mention it.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.940
What, have you never
seen tea before?

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.500
Don't you think
this tea looks a bit familiar?

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.737
Is there anything
that doesn't look familiar to you?

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.060
Please don't mind us.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.500
You have a wonderful relationship.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:12.940
I noticed it last time.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.630
It's truly enviable.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.540
You really know how to talk.

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.960
Are you fully recovered now?

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.870
I'm fine.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.590
Such a good lad.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.690
Too bad you were injured.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.000
Poor thing.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.740
Fang,

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.100
you really don't need to bring
so many things next time.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.940
Well,

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.920
I know you're
very grateful to Fei Ni.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.690
But Fei Ni

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:40.740
is getting married.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.130
I know.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.330
Mr. Fei, Mrs. Fei.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.330
I came today to formally propose.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.100
I'm going to marry Fei Ni.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:49.620
What did you say?

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:53.660
Say that again.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.500
I'm going to marry Fei Ni.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.020
Dad. Mom.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.990
Fei Ni.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.900
You're back.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.890
Fang Muyang.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:19.730
Didn't I tell you

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.130
I wouldn't go to the hospital again?

00:05:21.226 --> 00:05:22.350
There's no point coming here.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.880
Get up. Let's go. Out.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.330
Alright, alright. Stop pretending.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.010
Fang Muyang already told us.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.890
Told you what?

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:31.210
Turn around.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.540
Fei Ni, what's going on?

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.690
Fang Muyang said
you're going to marry him.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.370
He even brought all these gifts.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.290
Didn't you say you wouldn't tell anyone?

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.690
- How could you tell them?
- You...

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.580
Come with me.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.970
You, step outside.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.130
Start talking.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:59.890
What's this about?

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.890
Are you really going to marry that fool?

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.010
Mom, Fang Muyang isn't a fool.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.660
Don't argue with me.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.100
Didn't you tell me yourself

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.130
that there was nothing
going on between you two?

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.737
That was...

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:11.860
Not before.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.430
There is now.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:14.100
You...

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.970
Ni, have you completely
lost your mind?

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.330
Weren't you seeing Ye Feng?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.130
We broke up.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:25.370
You broke up?

00:06:27.982 --> 00:06:29.100
Forget whose fault it was.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.380
You end things with Ye Feng

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.620
and the next minute
you're marrying Fang Muyang?

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.200
How...

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.860
How is that not two-timing?

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.330
If people find out,

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:39.940
the gossip alone will bury you.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.860
Let them talk.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.500
I love Fang Muyang.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.500
I'm marrying him.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.530
You want to marry her? Not a chance.

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.620
Fang Muyang,
what on earth are you thinking?

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:52.540
Look at you.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.330
You don't even have a proper job.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.130
And forget about
having a place of your own.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.710
You can barely feed yourself,

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:58.860
and you want to get married?

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:00.990
How are you going to support Ni?

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.100
Sir,

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.330
my sister left me one hundred yuan.

00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:06.340
I'm in a training course
at the Jiangcheng Daily.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.360
I'll be able to earn money
drawing comic strips.

00:07:09.248 --> 00:07:10.100
I can support Fei Ni.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.770
Alright, alright.

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:11.860
Forget marriage.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.300
You shouldn't even like her.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.540
What do you even see in him?

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.640
So he's decent-looking,

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:19.810
and has a mild temper.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:20.890
What good is that?

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:22.330
When you marry a man,

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:23.315
it's about livelihood.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.440
He doesn't even have a stable job.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.810
And with his condition,

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.740
what if he never fully recovers?

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:30.250
What then?

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.130
What if he relapses one day?

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.130
By then, it'll be too late for regrets.

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:37.010
We'll deal with it
when we get there.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:38.450
Ni,

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.010
you've always been

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.860
so sensible
and careful since you were little.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.010
But when it comes to your own marriage,

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:46.420
you've lost your head!

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:48.010
Sir,

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.010
I'm very clear-headed.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:51.940
I know Fei Ni is too.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.130
Why can't you get it?

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.450
Even if Fei Ni has
broken up with Ye Feng,

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.693
her mother and I still won't
agree to this marriage.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:01.500
You should

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.890
- just give it up.
- Give it up.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:03.890
Fei Ni...

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.300
Fei Ni, don't be mad.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.500
Why would you suddenly propose?

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.130
Don't couples visit both families

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.890
before they get married?

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.300
My parents aren't here,

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.420
so I could only go to yours.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:15.860
Didn't we agree yesterday

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:17.100
to keep this from them for now?

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:18.010
I don't understand.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:19.940
Why won't you tell them the truth?

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.330
Tell them you're marrying me

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:22.300
just to get a unit.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.130
If I told them

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.130
I'm marrying you to free up
a room for my brother,

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.848
it would make things harder for them.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:39.630
Forget it.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.780
It was my idea anyway.

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:49.690
Are you so eager to marry me?

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.450
You've forgotten everything,
and you've still got

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:54.330
the nerve.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:55.810
Stop worrying.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.540
This started because of me.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.940
I'll fix it.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:02.140
How?

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.180
I'll find a way

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:05.660
to make your parents like me.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:10.690
Now I'm sure
your brain really is damaged.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:11.940
Don't underestimate me.

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:13.810
I'm very popular at the hospital.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:15.780
The doctors and nurses all like me.

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:20.410
Stop sighing.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.570
You'll sigh all your luck away.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:24.610
Just let me try.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:26.700
We've got nothing to lose.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:28.490
Fine. Go ahead.

00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:32.690
Who are you calling "nothing"?

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.200
My dad?

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:39.630
I...

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:40.780
Stop right there!

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.000
Mom.

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:51.040
Did you know

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.430
Fei Ni was marrying Fang Muyang?

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:53.730
Her marriage

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:54.900
has nothing to do with you.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.330
Of course it does!

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.560
Why did you issue them
a letter of introduction?

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.690
It's freedom of marriage.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.850
On what grounds would I refuse?

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:04.450
She can't marry Fang Muyang.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:05.510
Absolutely not!

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:07.900
Ye Feng,

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.300
I need to criticize you on this.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.210
You're not even
as clear-headed as Fei Ni.

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:18.090
She knows you two aren't
right for each other.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:19.090
She stepped back.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.330
She let it go.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.610
But you just won't stop.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:24.540
No, Mom.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.350
Everyone knows

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:27.690
we were seeing each other.

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:29.540
And now she's marrying Fang Muyang.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.060
What does that make me look like?

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:33.420
You care about your pride?

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.060
Then find someone better.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.330
Like Ling Yi.

00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:37.940
Let me tell you,

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.330
don't think I don't see through you.

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:40.590
You're upset

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:42.604
because Fei Ni got
into Fang Muyang's bike.

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:44.410
You feel humiliated.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:45.330
You want to save face.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.400
Just give up on that idea.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.020
Stop pestering her.

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:51.400
Otherwise, you really will lose face.

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:52.780
Mom, that's not...

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:53.570
Enough.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:55.140
It's settled!

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.540
Go buy some movie tickets later.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.450
Take Ling Yi to the movies.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.140
And after that, go for a walk together.

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:12.940
If you dare not go,

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:15.210
don't even think about coming home.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:16.690
You're on your own.

00:11:36.337 --> 00:11:37.530
Ms. Fang, Ms. Ding, goodbye.

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:38.230
Goodbye.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:38.850
Goodbye.

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:41.850
Ms. Fang, let's go together.

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:45.020
No, I still have some work to finish.

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:48.610
Oh, right, tomorrow's Sunday.

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:49.540
Let's go see a movie.

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:52.450
Sure.

(Fang, about this research project...)

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.540
(After careful consideration,)

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.330

you're not the right fit.)

(He comes from a top cadre family.)

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:34.060
Have you truly cut ties

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:35.730
with your parents

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:37.690
and your family?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.990
Look at you.

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:15.690
You couldn't even
persuade Fang Muyang.

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.330
And you persuaded Fei Ni?

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:19.960
Is that even comparable?

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:21.380
Keep your voice down.

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:26.420
You know how stubborn Ni is.

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:27.426
You've seen it yourself.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:29.900
But Fang Muyang's just a fool.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.315
And you can't even handle that.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:33.850
That makes him even harder to deal with.

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:35.660
He won't listen.

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:37.180
You can't reason with him.

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:40.450
Fang Muyang is

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:41.900
much more trouble than Fei Ni.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:44.330
So what do we do now?

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:50.090
It's easy to understand

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:52.210
why Fang Muyang likes Ni.

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:54.730
I mean, Ni's such a good girl.

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:55.760
Who wouldn't like her?

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:56.540
Exactly.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:59.490
But Ni likes Fang Muyang?

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:01.940
That's the problem.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:04.810
Who falls for a fool?

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:08.660
Something's off.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:10.540
What do you mean?

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:17.900
I don't know.

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.330
But lately,

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:21.660
she's not herself.

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:22.940
Let's sleep.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:24.540
Go to sleep.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:48.780
(Math Department Staff Office)

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:54.690
Long time no see.

00:14:58.610 --> 00:14:59.690
Here for Professor Wu?

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:03.810
No.

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:06.020
I'm here for you.

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:14.610
Do you have a minute?

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:16.140
Take a walk with me?

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.560
Have you been busy lately?

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.690
I thought you weren't going to ask.

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.400
Are you going to answer?

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.690
I went to the countryside
with a medical team.

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:07.060
I just got back this morning.

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:09.660
I wasn't avoiding you.

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:12.850
I didn't ask that.

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:15.970
Then just take it as

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:17.810
a clarification from me.

00:16:19.493 --> 00:16:21.330
I've been thinking
a lot these past few days.

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:23.660
About you.

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:32.810
About your family background.

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:34.660
To be honest,

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:36.450
as a partner,

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:38.540
you're not my best option.

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.850
The doctors at our hospital,

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.540
my father's comrade's daughter,

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:45.210
even the teachers at your school,

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:47.810
would all be more suitable than you

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.490
from a practical standpoint.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.300
Isn't it too early
to talk about marriage?

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.610
We've only met a few times.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:58.850
But for me,

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:00.060
that's already enough.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:02.940
Fang Mujing,

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:05.340
I came here to ask you one thing.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.570
Will you marry me?

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:18.690
You just said we're not suitable.

00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:20.900
That's right. We're not.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:23.860
But I'm not a pragmatist.

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:26.940
So I'm still choosing you.

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:31.620
I'm sorry, Qu Hua.

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.530
I have plenty of choices too.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:36.690
And in my view,
many are better than you.

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:37.690
More suitable.

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:41.250
For example, teachers at our school,

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:43.100
my former university classmates,

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:45.690
even a doctor like you,

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.737
except he's already
a deputy hospital director.

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:49.290
And unlike you,

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:51.530
I happen to be a pragmatist.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.210
If you're a pragmatist,

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:57.290
then you should choose me.

00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:58.490
Oh?

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:00.940
You come
from a political background,

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:01.860
while I

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.690
come from
a "black five categories" family.

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:05.690
So when you propose,

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:06.940
I should just accept it?

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:10.100
You're a smart lady.

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:11.490
So am I.

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:14.140
Smart people don't need pleasantries.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:15.290
So,

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:19.900
yes, I do think you should
accept without hesitation.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:27.860
I need some time.

00:18:58.450 --> 00:18:59.120
Fang Mujing,

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.820
you've been sitting here
for three hours.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.290
For us doctors,

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:05.860
time is precious.

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:07.530
Three hours is enough

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.290
for me to save a life.

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:12.140
This is about marriage.

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:14.040
Shouldn't I think it through?

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:17.540
But you're not thinking.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.940
When I asked you earlier,

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:21.840
you already had your answer.

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:24.210
You just didn't say it.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.290
And what is my answer?

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:31.120
I don't know.

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:32.900
Then why not ask?

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:41.450
Fang Mujing,

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:43.870
will you marry me?

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:48.040
I will.

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:33.200
Playing chess with you is exhausting.

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:39.010
Liu, don't be so impatient.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:42.690
Chess is all about staying calm.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.050
One wrong move,

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.290
and you lose the whole game.

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:50.140
Mr. Fei.

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:52.450
You scared me.

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:54.210
What are you doing here?

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:55.530
I came to see you.

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:56.770
I never ask for that.

00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:58.860
Come on, are we playing or not?

00:20:58.860 --> 00:20:59.530
Of course...

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:01.100
Of course not!

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:02.960
I was about to make a great move,

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:03.940
then he shows up

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:05.340
and throws me off.

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:06.340
That's not fair.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.140
You and your excuses.

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:09.250
A loss is a loss.

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:11.980
You'd lose even if he hadn't come.

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:12.980
No way.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:14.290
When have I ever lost?

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:15.940
Mr. Fei is amazing at chess.

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:17.290
He taught me everything I know.

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:23.090
Stop egging him on.

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:24.570
Fei,

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:26.570
I'll give you a Horse.

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:27.530
I'll give you a Chariot.

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:29.380
How about this?

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:30.980
If Mr. Fei wins like that,

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:32.090
it won't count.

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:33.380
I'll play for him.

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:34.490
I'm his apprentice.

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:35.620
- Not bad, Fei.
- Come on.

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.330
Since when did you
take on an apprentice?

00:21:38.004 --> 00:21:39.180
I'm tired of playing with you.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:40.940
Fine, let's have a match.

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:46.180
But it's no fun without stakes.

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.290
What are we playing for?

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:48.010
Alright.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:49.140
You name it.

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:49.940
Watermelon.

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:51.490
A big one.

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:52.860
No problem.

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:55.490
And if I win?

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:08.980
(Wuliangye)

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:11.140
These two bottles of liquor
and this chess set

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.180
were meant
as a gift for Mr. Fei.

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:15.570
If you win, they're yours.

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:17.050
No way!

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:17.980
Don't touch it.

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:20.250
That's the one.

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:21.730
If I lose,

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:23.900
I'll buy you watermelon for a week.

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:26.330
Deal.

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:28.250
Are you sure?

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:30.350
Mr. Fei,

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:31.620
trust me.

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.180
A jar of clam cream, too.

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:39.250
Alright.

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:44.420
Fei Ni,

00:22:44.915 --> 00:22:46.770
I was just about
to look for you after work.

00:22:46.893 --> 00:22:47.900
And some vanishing cream.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:49.400
No, not the loose packs.

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:50.890
The bottled one.

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:54.250
Buying something this expensive?

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.980
Things must be
getting serious with Ye Feng.

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:58.350
Is that for his mother?

00:22:58.530 --> 00:22:59.570
It's not for his mother.

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:01.140
It's for mine. How much?

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:01.900
Five yuan.

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:04.490
Shouldn't Ye Feng be paying?

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:08.090
I turned him down.

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:11.730
You're about to lose.

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:14.660
This kid's really good.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:18.330
Make your move. Stop stalling.

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:19.870
Hurry up.

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:22.180
Stop stalling.

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:24.570
It's just one move.

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:25.220
How about

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:26.660
you just admit defeat?

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:33.290
Check.

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:36.330
Mr. Liu, you're out of moves.

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:37.330
Liu,

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:39.490
how many games
have you lost now?

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:41.380
How many big watermelons
do you owe me?

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:42.180
How about this?

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:44.140
We'll spot him a Horse. No,

00:23:44.182 --> 00:23:45.460
a Chariot, a Horse, and a Canon.

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:46.290
Sure.

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:49.250
I'm done playing!

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:52.180
Where are you going?

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:53.290
To buy watermelons.

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:56.940
Fei, your apprentice is impressive.

00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:59.810
That's because Mr. Fei taught me well.

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:02.180
Stay humble.

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:03.530
Young people need discipline.

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:07.420
Let's drink in celebration today!

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:07.900
Fei,

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:09.330
I heard you beat Liu.

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:11.490
Just a small win.

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:14.180
That's a huge watermelon.

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:16.730
Fei, who's this?

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:18.490
My chess apprentice.

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:19.270
Nice.

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:23.180
What are you doing?

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:25.900
This watermelon I won

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:26.980
and this liquor

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:28.530
are all for you.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.330
Ni's mother went back
to her parents' today.

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:35.980
Otherwise,

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:37.330
you wouldn't have set foot in here.

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:38.770
Yes, of course.

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:39.980
Come in.

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:46.660
What were you thinking?

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.090
Even if Ye Feng is no good,

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:49.770
you can't marry Fang Muyang.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.810
No wonder your parents won't agree.

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:56.050
Why are you saying that too?

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:00.860
Fei Ni, I know you're rushing

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:02.940
into marriage
to free up the room for us.

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:04.790
If you were

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:06.380
marrying someone like Ye Feng,

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:08.530
of course, I'd hope you'd marry soon.

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.730
But if it's someone like Fang Muyang,

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:12.330
even if you give us the room,

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:13.460
I wouldn't dare move in.

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:15.770
You'd actually marry a fool

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:17.700
for our sake?

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:19.940
No, Fei Ni.

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:21.140
I can't let you do that.

00:25:21.204 --> 00:25:22.660
Your brother wouldn't agree either.

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:24.980
Lin Mei,

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:28.160
I'm marrying Fang Muyang

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:30.730
not for you or my brother.

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:32.980
I'm doing it for myself.

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:35.250
And besides,

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:37.820
Fang Muyang just lost his memory.

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:39.770
It's not like he's mentally impaired.

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:41.900
He's not as bad
as you make him out to be.

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:44.490
He's physically healthy,

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:45.980
he has good character,

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:47.460
and he can draw.

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:49.730
He can earn his own money now.

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:52.050
Most importantly,

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:55.730
the factory can give him a unit.

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:00.980
But at the end of the day,

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:02.770
he had a head injury.

00:26:02.848 --> 00:26:04.330
What if there are lasting effects?

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:07.010
Fei Ni,

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:10.050
maybe Fang Muyang isn't that bad,

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:12.660
but you could definitely do better.

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:19.900
Right now,

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:22.700
Fang Muyang is the best choice.

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:25.090
Lin Mei, trust me.

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.700
I wouldn't risk ruining my whole future.

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:34.490
Even if I agree,

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:36.330
your brother won't.

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:38.330
Then don't tell him.

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:40.050
He'll find out eventually.

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:40.900
He'll blame me.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.330
He won't.

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:43.460
How could he?

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.250
If you tell him now,

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:46.700
you'll just make things worse.

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:48.250
I can barely handle my parents as it is.

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:49.730
If Fei Ting gets involved too...

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:52.980
then I might as well die.

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:54.570
Don't say that.

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:55.380
Touch wood.

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:03.290
Alright.

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:06.250
What can I do to help?

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.330
Keep it a secret.

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:16.940
Wait here.
I'll grab you a couple of cans.

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:25.570
Master,

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:28.460
I just braised some beef.
Have a taste.

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:29.770
Fang,

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:31.860
don't simply call anyone master.

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:33.940
I only let it slide earlier

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:35.570
to save your face.

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:38.180
Alright.

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:39.770
Mr. Fei.

00:27:43.848 --> 00:27:44.980
Let's have a drink.

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:49.570
Comrade Fang,

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:52.050
given where we stand right now,

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:54.050
it's not appropriate
for us to drink together.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:58.530
Sure.

00:27:58.530 --> 00:27:59.290
Alright.

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:03.730
Hello?

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:05.730
Is this Qianjin Farm?

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:07.570
I'm looking for Fei Ting.

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:17.700
(Car)
This thing isn't cheap, is it?

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:19.010
Where did you get it?

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:22.050
I made it.

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:26.860
You made it?

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:27.810
Yeah.

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:31.660
Fei Ni told me
you like playing chess.

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:33.530
I went around a few shops.

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:35.290
The cheap ones wouldn't suit you.

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:36.271
And the good ones...

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:39.140
I can't afford those.

00:28:39.315 --> 00:28:41.140
One of my classmates
from the training course

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.090
had a broken
red sandalwood chair at home.

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:44.860
So I paid a little
and bought the wood.

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:46.490
I carved them one by one.

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:50.290
It wasn't hard.

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:53.140
You've got some skills after all.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:02.250
Mr. Fei,

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:06.330
I can do a lot of things.

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:09.010
I won't go hungry.

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:14.620
I know why you're doing this.

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.010
You want her mother and me

00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:20.490
to agree to your marriage with Ni.

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:21.250
I also know

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.900
you truly care about our Ni.

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:25.530
She's such a good girl.

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:26.530
Who wouldn't like her?

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:27.140
Right?

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:29.290
But let's be honest.

00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:30.810
A good family

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:32.004
and background

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:35.140
are solid and objective conditions.

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:38.050
But feelings are subjective.

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:39.140
They're fragile.

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:42.090
What matters most is living well,

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:44.530
building a steady,
grounded life. Right?

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:53.530
Yes.

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:54.940
You're right.

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:56.980
I admit it.

00:29:57.810 --> 00:29:59.460
Ye Feng has a good family.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:01.460
But that doesn't mean

00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:03.900
Fei Ni will live happily.

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:06.330
Now that's far-fetched.

00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:08.420
Did Fei Ni tell you

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:10.290
why she broke up with Ye Feng?

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:18.010
Unbelievable.

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:20.140
So all that braised beef went to waste.

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:21.700
Mr. Fei, please.

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.090
Don't get upset.

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:30.490
Mr. Fei,

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:32.940
to me,

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:35.180
Fei Ni is the best in the world.

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:37.940
She's one of a kind.

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:39.530
I understand her.

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:40.940
I respect her.

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:42.620
But in Ye Feng's eyes,

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:44.220
she's just a worker

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:47.420
trying to marry up.

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:50.220
So tell me, Mr. Fei.

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:51.900
What should she choose?

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:54.010
Of course, I want her to choose someone

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:55.700
who cherishes her,

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:57.140
protects her, respects her.

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:00.660
You know,

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:02.660
going to university

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:04.010
is Fei Ni's dream.

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:05.940
It's what she wants most.

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:08.090
But in Ye Feng's eyes,

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.530
it's just her way of marrying up

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:12.090
or landing a better job.

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:17.050
Not only is she not cherished,

00:31:17.804 --> 00:31:18.940
but she's looked down on.

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:25.220
Mr. Fei,

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:27.090
maybe Mrs. Fei and you think

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:28.700
that marrying someone

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:30.530
with better means matters more.

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:33.530
But if that person doesn't value her,

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:36.290
no matter how great his family is,

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:37.730
it means nothing.

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:39.640
Right?

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:45.530
So what you're saying is,

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:48.330
you support Fei Ni going to university?

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:50.420
I do. I fully support her.

00:31:50.715 --> 00:31:51.460
If she needs it,

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:52.460
I'll help her.

00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:04.700
I see.

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:06.900
No wonder our Ni likes you.

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:10.330
Let's say, just hypothetically...

00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:11.530
Purely hypothetically speaking,

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:12.450
if I agree

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:15.260
to your marriage today,

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:17.590
can you promise me

00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:19.660
that everything you said today is true?

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:23.250
Mr. Fei,

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:24.900
I promise you,

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:27.330
every word I said today is true.

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:29.460
And I'll stand by it.

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:39.250
Let's drink, just us two.

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:44.140
Don't just sit there

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:46.620
with the chessboard
between us like a border.

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:47.730
Come here.

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:48.980
Come on.

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:56.290
I may just pull curtains
at the theater now,

00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:58.770
but thirty years ago,

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:01.980
I was the star
of our city's Peking Opera troupe.

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:08.700
Even if the sky falls, so what?

00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:17.980
You know Tai Chi?

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:20.530
The Tai Chi I practice

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:22.530
has been passed
down in the Fei family.

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:24.770
The 72 Forms of Fei-style Tai Chi.

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:26.090
Push harder.

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:27.420
Use all your strength.

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:28.290
Harder.

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:29.700
Harder.

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:30.750
There you go.

00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:33.530
Mr. Fei,

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:35.380
you could
teach classes with that skill.

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:39.120
It'd be a shame
not to pass it down.

00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:41.050
How about this?

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:42.448
When the time comes,

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:45.530
I'll illustrate all 72 forms,

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:47.290
add explanations,
bind them into a book,

00:33:47.448 --> 00:33:48.700
and give a copy to everyone

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:51.180
so they can all admire your style.

00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:53.900
But Mr. Fei,

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:55.770
the urgent matter

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:57.900
is my marriage with Fei Ni.

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:00.050
You've agreed,

00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:01.530
but this household

00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:03.140
has another half holding it up.

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:14.940
There's a way?

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:15.980
Let me think.

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:23.300
(Teaching Building)

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:24.530
Just these two questions.

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:25.940
Revise them at home.

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:27.271
-Alright, I understand.
-Good.

00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:51.340
Professor Wu,

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:54.690
Qu Hua and I are getting married.

00:34:55.026 --> 00:34:56.380
Please have some wedding candy.

00:34:58.690 --> 00:34:59.490
Qu Hua?

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:03.340
I didn't expect things to move so fast.

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:06.490
Neither did I.

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:08.690
But overall,

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:10.380
I don't think it's a bad thing.

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:12.780
What do you see in him?

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:17.460
He comes from a good family.

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:20.570
What else

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:21.780
do you know about him?

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:24.260
He's a neurosurgeon.

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:25.900
Good-looking,

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:26.900
steady temperament,

00:35:27.226 --> 00:35:28.300
and top-notch skills.

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:30.980
Knowing just that probably isn't enough.

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:33.340
What about his past relationships?

00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:34.570
Who did he date?

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:35.740
Why did they break up?

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:38.050
Aren't you going to look into that?

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:41.780
To me, that's all in the past.

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:42.650
It doesn't matter,

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:45.530
as long as he comes
from a revolutionary family.

00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:50.340
Professor Wu, once I marry him,

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:50.780
can I

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:52.530
join the project team?

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:57.570
Once you become a military spouse,
of course, you can.

00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:59.300
But Fang,

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:02.490
is sacrificing your personal feelings

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:03.900
worth it?

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:07.130
It is.

00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:11.170
And to me,
it's not even a sacrifice.

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:14.530
Fang.

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:16.690
Sometimes, life

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:18.300
is like our algorithm research.

00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:20.730
You may have to go through
countless trials and errors

00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:22.340
before you find the right answer.

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:23.980
I hope you treat love

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:26.690
with the same
perseverance as research.

00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:28.740
But remember,

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:30.980
once you spot

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:31.780
a miscalculation,

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:33.980
don't cling to it blindly.

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:39.300
Are you saying

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:41.490
you don't have
high hopes for my marriage?

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:44.570
Whether I approve isn't what matters.

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:45.980
What matters is

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:47.300
whether you're ready.

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:49.980
After all,
you haven't known each other long.

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:52.380
You might not know him that well.

00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:55.570
That's true.

00:36:56.050 --> 00:36:57.780
But for me, it's enough.

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:00.490
Thank you, Professor Wu.

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:02.650
I'll go draft the application.

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:22.130
When we get to my place, just say

00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:23.780
you bought these for my mom.

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:26.170
Alright.

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:27.490
I'll pay you back.

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:30.130
No need. Why are we talking money?

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:31.210
Fair enough.

00:37:31.248 --> 00:37:33.260
Sooner or later,
what's mine is yours anyway.

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:36.900
I'm still not sure
this is going to work.

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:42.300
Just try to make a good impression.

00:37:42.937 --> 00:37:43.980
And when we're there,

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.900
don't be so polite with me.

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:47.440
We're supposed to look like a couple.

00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:48.980
We're not even registered yet.

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:50.130
We're not a couple yet.

00:37:50.293 --> 00:37:51.260
When are we registering?

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:55.090
Only after our parents agree.

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:56.740
"Our parents?"

00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:57.260
No.

00:37:57.530 --> 00:38:00.170
- The Fei Family Tai Chi Manual.
- The Fei Family Tai Chi Manual.

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:09.010
Open it. Take a look.

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:17.570
Fei, that's you?

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:19.900
You can't tell?

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:22.260
I had no idea you practiced Tai Chi.

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:26.050
Plenty of people practice Tai Chi.

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:28.130
But how many
publish their own manual?

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:30.570
Fei, who put this together for you?

00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:31.690
My apprentice.

00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:32.300
Fang.

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:34.050
As the saying goes,

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:35.170
a man

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:36.300
leaves his name behind.

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:37.490
And I, Fei,

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:41.490
finally have a book of my own.

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:44.900
Would you like to learn it, too?

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:46.210
Are you in?

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:47.130
Yes or no?

00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:49.980
Tai Chi is good stuff. Come on.

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:52.020
- Sign me up!
- I want to learn!

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:54.460
- Sign me up!
- Make a few more copies.

00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:56.000
- Make a few more.
- Yes!

00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:59.040
- Let's all learn.
- This is a martial arts manual.

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:00.380
It's not mass-produced.

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:01.460
I can't just make more.

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:03.380
How about this?

00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:05.340
If you truly want to learn,

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:07.260
I'll sincerely teach you.

00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:09.170
Call me Master Fei,

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:11.260
and I'll teach you for free.

00:39:11.671 --> 00:39:13.090
- Teacher Fei!
- Teacher Fei!

00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:14.600
Master Fei, we want to learn!

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:15.848
- Master Fei!
- Master Fei!

00:39:15.871 --> 00:39:17.360
- Sign me up now!
- Me too!

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:20.090
Fang Muyang, you can stop now.

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:24.390
- Fang Muyang, there are people here.
- Isn't that Fei Ni?

00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:25.740
Stop it. Hurry up.

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:27.530
Mr. Liu, no chess today?

00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:28.650
Get lost, kid.

00:39:28.650 --> 00:39:30.340
Fang Muyang, stop. Stop!

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:32.990
Isn't that Fei's daughter?

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:35.920
Left leg first.

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:41.530
Draw in the energy of heaven
and earth through the crown.

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:44.130
Let it sink to your dantian.

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:47.180
Mr. Fei, that's a lot of students.

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:49.380
Who's that young man?

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:50.110
No idea.

00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:51.570
All thanks to your manual.

00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:52.740
Fang,

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:54.340
you did a great job on that manual.

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:55.780
- Yeah.
- It looks great.

00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:57.490
It's beautifully drawn.

00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:58.250
Dad...

00:39:58.650 --> 00:39:59.460
Go upstairs.

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:03.010
Wait...

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:06.820
Go on.

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:07.490
But...

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:11.650
Fei,

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:14.170
your apprentice became your son-in-law.

00:40:17.115 --> 00:40:18.570
That's between the youngsters.

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:19.530
Who knows?

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:24.260
Hey, don't pose like a turtle.

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:25.170
Move.

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:27.780
Stand properly.

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:30.340
Half an hour,
then you're dismissed.

00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:31.900
We continue tomorrow.

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:34.420
Hold it steady.

00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:40.090
What's going on?

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:41.170
What manual?

00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:42.893
Why were you
exchanging looks with my dad?

00:40:43.404 --> 00:40:44.350
That's not important.

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:46.210
Your dad's on our side now.

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:47.130
We're allies.

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:50.490
Listen,

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:52.530
until your mom says yes,

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:53.940
don't rat me out.

00:40:57.090 --> 00:40:57.650
Dad,

00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:00.340
you really agree to our marriage?

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:04.860
Ni, let me ask you this.

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:07.130
Why are you so determined to marry him?

00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:10.940
I...

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:25.780
Because he respects
and supports my dreams.

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:28.380
I believe we'll build
a good life together.

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:34.050
That's enough for me.

00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:36.570
As for me,

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:39.570
you've passed my test.

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:40.980
As for your mom,

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:42.570
that depends on

00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:44.980
whether our preemptive strike works.

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:48.300
A preemptive strike?

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:55.650
Wang,

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:57.940
why are you practicing Tai Chi?

00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:01.760
Fei's apprentice published a manual.

00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:03.490
We're practicing from it.

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:04.330
Apprentice?

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:05.260
Who?

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:07.050
The young lad Fang.

00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:08.380
The young hero.

00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:09.650
Baoying,

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:11.190
are you handing out

00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:12.360
wedding candy soon?

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:14.300
What wedding candy?

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:15.460
Wedding candy!

00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:23.940
Madam Wu,

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:24.870
you're so lucky.

00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:31.780
Auntie Wu, you're back.

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:32.780
Congratulations.

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:33.937
When Fei Ni gets married,

00:42:33.937 --> 00:42:35.160
don't forget our wedding candy.

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:36.210
Married?

00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:37.050
To whom?

00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:38.260
Oh, please.

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:39.530
Still denying it?

00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:40.940
The director's son the other day,

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:42.570
and now the hero
who saved someone.

00:42:42.610 --> 00:42:44.260
Your daughter really is something.

00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:46.820
And this new son-in-law of yours

00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:47.820
is quite impressive.

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:49.530
The gifts he brought you

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:51.460
are top quality, no doubt.

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:52.570
He's not my son-in-law.

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:54.820
Stop pretending.

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:56.420
My husband said

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:57.570
he just saw them downstairs,

00:42:57.570 --> 00:43:00.010
holding hands.

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:08.570
All right.

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:10.130
Whose idea was it?

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:11.260
- Mine.
- Mine.
