00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.940
=Ancient Bracelet=

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.380
=Episode 4=

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.660
=Where Is Your Secret Lover?=

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:28.920
(This woman)

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.230
(has a betrothed,)

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.560
(dreams of a secret lover,)

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.480
(and now does this to me.)

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.870
(How outrageous.)

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.840
Your Highness.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.680
How is it?

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.000
The ruler claimed

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.590
he was the healer's husband

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.560
and chose to rest there.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.870
Husband?

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.350
(Though this is perilous,)

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.200
(Ying Du has saved me twice.)

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.510
(I have to repay such kindness.)

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.190
(This is the Flame Grass.)

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.400
(Almost.)

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.280
(It's a hope for Ying Du's cold poison.)

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.800
Zhaoli,

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:48.680
last night, you...

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.920
Your Majesty.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.520
Why is it you?

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.710
Please return with me.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.590
The State and the royals

00:02:57.643 --> 00:02:59.000
cannot stand without your presence.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.430
I already have my plans.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.270
Your Majesty,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.840
are you really staying here

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.030
for a mere healer?

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.240
Have you forgotten your vow
to Goddess Xingyue?

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.680
Ying Du,

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.430
I will bestow upon you all of my power

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.120
to help you save the people
of Puluo State.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.680
But you must protect my daughter

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.150
and keep her safe for her life.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.280
Rest assured.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.910
I will keep my promise

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.630
and guard her forever.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.030
Saintess Xihe hasn't been found yet.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.590
Are you breaking your promise

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.360
by staying beside a healer?

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.080
Who are you?

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.710
I don't know you.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.030
Why do you wish to take my life?

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:43.710
Zhaoli.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.680
Never have I seen the ruler
so unsettled,

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.240
rushing about in such haste.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.520
It must be because of that healer.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.870
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.080
I am a healer of the Wuyue tribe,

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.920
Wu Luoluo.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.960
Do you know Wu Zhaoli?

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.240
I do.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.590
You're just a healer,

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.240
yet you dare endanger the ruler.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.310
Today,

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.329
I shall take your life
on the ruler's behalf.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.040
What ruler?

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.120
I don't know them.

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.750
You caught the wrong person.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.070
Still daring to argue?

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.390
(I can't die for a ruler)

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.510
(I don't know.)

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.070
Help!

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.720
Save your strength. It's useless.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.230
Ying Du.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.910
Ying Du.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:06.720
You saved me again.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:13.590
Zhaoli.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.880
Ying Du.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.030
I...

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.510
I've found the herbs
to cure your cold poison.

00:05:19.993 --> 00:05:21.303
You've saved me time and again.

00:05:21.314 --> 00:05:22.709
I have nothing worthy to repay you.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.920
Please, take this.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.760
Luo Cheng,

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.160
how dare you act on your own!

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.600
You almost cost her life!

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.760
Your Majesty,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.020
I only wish to ease your suffering.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.890
Your Majesty,

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:34.920
if she lives another day,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.840
you...

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.360
You're the ruler.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.000
Zhaoli,

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.560
what happened to your hand?

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:48.950
You're the ruler.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.270
So,

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.560
I was taken into the Palace,

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.000
drugged,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.310
and almost beaten to death

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.430
because of you.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.040
You wanted me dead,

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.190
yet now you come to save me.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.480
Do you find this game amusing?

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:06.920
Your Majesty,

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.310
even in your eyes,

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:10.510
I am but insignificant.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.900
But that doesn't mean

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.070
you can decide my fate as you please.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:15.590
Zhaoli,

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.430
it's not what you think.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.360
You once saved my life;

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.430
now, I return that favor.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.560
We're even now.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.160
(Why does my heart ache so?)

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:10.590
Zhaoli,

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.560
where is your secret lover?

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.830
Why isn't he here to protect you?

00:07:15.273 --> 00:07:17.070
I have no strength to quarrel
with you today.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.400
Step aside.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:23.870
What do you want?

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:26.190
What do I want?

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.360
I want you dead.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.310
Don't you know

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:34.830
killing your own people

00:07:35.486 --> 00:07:36.750
will lead to grave consequences?

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:38.670
Go.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.480
Let go of me.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:47.950
Your hand...

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:49.750
You're severely poisoned.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:51.310
If I kill you

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:52.630
by accident,

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.560
I could say you were killed

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.310
by the poison.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:58.360
Besides,

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:00.600
the chief is my uncle.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:01.800
Who do you think

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:04.310
he'll help,

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.190
you or me?
