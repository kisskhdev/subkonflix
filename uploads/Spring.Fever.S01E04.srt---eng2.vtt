EPISODE 4

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.927
You're right.

00:01:20.227 --> 00:01:21.729
I finally…

00:01:26.025 --> 00:01:27.276
remembered you.

00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:36.118
Remembered me?

00:01:36.911 --> 00:01:37.953
The dakgalbi place.

00:01:41.665 --> 00:01:44.209
1 YEAR AGO

00:01:48.505 --> 00:01:49.381
Eat up!

00:01:49.465 --> 00:01:50.925
-Yes, boss!
-Yes, sir!

00:01:51.592 --> 00:01:52.927
Thank you for the food!

00:01:53.844 --> 00:01:54.970
Sir. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:55.638 --> 00:01:58.140
A bottle of soju, please.

00:01:58.223 --> 00:01:59.808
Sure, just a second.

00:01:59.892 --> 00:02:00.851
Okay.

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.438
Here you go.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.691
I've never seen her before.

00:02:07.775 --> 00:02:09.652
Maybe she's broken-hearted.

00:02:42.893 --> 00:02:44.395
Geez.

00:02:45.688 --> 00:02:48.607
Who eats dakgalbi
with their head down like that?

00:02:49.817 --> 00:02:51.777
You shouldn't eat it like that.

00:02:52.611 --> 00:02:55.239
You should sit up straight like this,

00:02:56.532 --> 00:02:57.616
place this on your palm,

00:03:01.078 --> 00:03:06.041
and top it with a slice of radish,
two pieces of meat,

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.168
and a piece of garlic on top.

00:03:10.004 --> 00:03:10.838
Here.

00:03:11.964 --> 00:03:12.798
Have it.

00:03:15.426 --> 00:03:17.678
You country people are so nosy.

00:03:23.267 --> 00:03:24.727
You're not from here, right?

00:03:26.061 --> 00:03:27.062
Where are you from?

00:03:28.147 --> 00:03:29.148
What's your name?

00:03:33.986 --> 00:03:36.613
My name might not exist as of tomorrow.

00:03:42.661 --> 00:03:44.663
"Beauty."

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.711
Then is that why you asked me to meet you?

00:03:55.883 --> 00:03:58.260
Come to think of it,
the clothes you're wearing…

00:04:00.304 --> 00:04:02.014
Yes, I was wearing this that day.

00:04:13.025 --> 00:04:15.569
You're right. They're the same clothes.

00:04:16.487 --> 00:04:18.072
I was actually thinking

00:04:18.155 --> 00:04:21.533
you probably asked to see me
because you remembered.

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:23.243
Yes.

00:04:23.994 --> 00:04:27.081
So that's why you wanted to see me.

00:04:29.792 --> 00:04:32.336
To be honest,
I wanted to pretend not to remember.

00:04:33.295 --> 00:04:37.007
Because you're my student's uncle
and I was embarrassed you had to see that.

00:04:38.258 --> 00:04:39.301
But…

00:04:41.303 --> 00:04:45.891
I thought about
why I kept letting you get to me.

00:04:47.226 --> 00:04:48.143
And I realized

00:04:49.353 --> 00:04:52.356
that I felt indebted to you
on a subconscious level.

00:04:55.317 --> 00:04:57.361
And that might be the reason.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.826
So, I wanted to settle that debt today.

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:16.839
And lastly…

00:05:18.841 --> 00:05:19.716
Here.

00:05:38.026 --> 00:05:40.487
Now I finally feel like I've repaid you.

00:05:41.905 --> 00:05:44.074
I'm sorry I pretended not to remember.

00:05:47.286 --> 00:05:48.287
And thank you

00:05:49.955 --> 00:05:51.498
so much for that day.

00:05:54.084 --> 00:05:55.210
Bye, then.

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:05.512
Were you trying to die,
or was it just an accident?

00:07:46.071 --> 00:07:49.992
When you feel down,
sweets are the best cure. Okay?

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.755
What happened in Seoul?

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.259
Can you tell me about it?

00:08:12.055 --> 00:08:14.099
Why would I tell you about me?

00:08:16.059 --> 00:08:17.311
Who do you think you are?

00:08:19.396 --> 00:08:20.230
Bom.

00:08:26.069 --> 00:08:30.324
After spending some time with me,
you must think we're friends now.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:32.868
Mr. Sun Jae-gyu.

00:08:34.286 --> 00:08:35.829
We're nothing like that.

00:08:39.666 --> 00:08:41.752
So don't try to meddle in my business.

00:08:43.795 --> 00:08:48.967
And just treat me
as your nephew's teacher.

00:08:51.845 --> 00:08:52.679
Goodbye, then.

00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:59.186
Ms. Bom.

00:08:59.853 --> 00:09:01.938
Ms. Bom. Yoon…

00:09:47.275 --> 00:09:48.735
SHINSU HIGH SCHOOL
SUN JAE-GYU

00:09:48.819 --> 00:09:50.821
What happened in Seoul?

00:09:50.904 --> 00:09:52.823
Can you tell me about it?

00:09:55.158 --> 00:09:57.869
That was why
I wanted to pay my debt and end it.

00:10:30.068 --> 00:10:32.571
There's nothing sweet
in this house, so go.

00:10:33.655 --> 00:10:35.949
Just go. You won't?

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.541
What the heck? What's wrong with it?

00:11:02.017 --> 00:11:03.018
Hide.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.420
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

00:11:31.713 --> 00:11:33.673
But what brought you to my place?

00:11:34.466 --> 00:11:36.134
Oh. Well…

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:41.014
I dreamed of the perfect crime,
but it wasn't easy for a first-timer.

00:11:43.183 --> 00:11:46.311
You went through a lot
because of my sister that day, so…

00:11:46.394 --> 00:11:48.772
No, I just did my job as her teacher.

00:11:48.855 --> 00:11:51.483
Still, I should thank you as her brother.

00:11:51.566 --> 00:11:53.193
Thank me with luxury goods?

00:11:53.276 --> 00:11:55.737
No, it's just a shopping bag
for the brand.

00:12:00.951 --> 00:12:04.579
Well, these are the only shopping bags
I have at my place.

00:12:14.589 --> 00:12:15.423
Is it baeksuk?

00:12:20.929 --> 00:12:22.264
You'll need my number.

00:12:22.847 --> 00:12:26.643
Once you try it,
you'll definitely want to contact me.

00:12:46.162 --> 00:12:47.539
BOM, I SHOULDN'T HAVE MEDDLED…

00:12:47.622 --> 00:12:50.125
I apologize.

00:13:04.097 --> 00:13:05.473
Is it the same girl?

00:13:05.557 --> 00:13:08.018
Wow, you're texting each other now?

00:13:09.311 --> 00:13:10.687
Any plans to get a new job?

00:13:13.398 --> 00:13:17.068
I plan to work here
for the rest of my life.

00:13:17.152 --> 00:13:18.153
Okay.

00:13:19.029 --> 00:13:19.863
Wrap it up.

00:13:20.447 --> 00:13:22.741
What? Where are you going?
You need to move these.

00:13:22.824 --> 00:13:26.411
I feel so weak today,
I can't even lift a sheet of paper. Bye.

00:13:26.494 --> 00:13:27.370
Why do you feel…

00:13:28.997 --> 00:13:31.166
I plan to work here until I die!

00:13:31.249 --> 00:13:33.752
SPORTS CENTER

00:13:46.681 --> 00:13:49.976
The Shinsu High PE teacher
sure is different!

00:13:51.394 --> 00:13:55.649
What is this? You veterans
can't even beat a newbie?

00:13:56.232 --> 00:13:57.442
No one else?

00:13:57.525 --> 00:14:00.779
Are there any more guys
who want to spar with me?

00:14:30.684 --> 00:14:32.811
-Hello, sir!
-Hello, sir!

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.535
We're here to learn how to beat him
but might end up learning from him.

00:14:49.327 --> 00:14:52.622
They say there's a bully at school.

00:14:52.706 --> 00:14:53.832
No.

00:14:53.915 --> 00:14:54.874
-Just be quiet.
-No.

00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:58.002
He comes to the school,
acts rudely, and threatens them.

00:14:58.086 --> 00:14:59.963
-Don't.
-They must've suffered so much

00:15:00.046 --> 00:15:01.047
that they came here.

00:15:02.132 --> 00:15:04.718
Ms. Seo, didn't you say
we had to go somewhere?

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.554
Well… Oh, right.

00:15:07.637 --> 00:15:09.556
Someone we know is about to die.

00:15:09.639 --> 00:15:12.600
-We should go to the funeral hall.
-Yes, we should hurry.

00:15:13.184 --> 00:15:14.728
Still, you should spar with him.

00:15:15.562 --> 00:15:18.815
The teachers have been waiting so long
to spar with you.

00:15:20.608 --> 00:15:23.737
He treats his kid's teachers like that?

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:26.906
It's only right
to pull out his arm with an armbar

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:32.078
and finish him off
with the North-south choke.

00:15:35.665 --> 00:15:39.586
But today I came to clear my head
because I feel off.

00:15:39.669 --> 00:15:41.838
I'm sorry, but let's spar next time.

00:15:42.547 --> 00:15:45.842
Goodness. That's too bad,
but we should take a rain check.

00:15:48.178 --> 00:15:49.596
Let's do it.

00:15:52.348 --> 00:15:56.269
What's gotten into him?
Why is he acting up so much today?

00:16:20.794 --> 00:16:22.837
You're pretty good, huh?

00:16:25.131 --> 00:16:28.051
Hey, do you know
a good burial spot for him?

00:16:28.676 --> 00:16:30.386
May he rest in peace.

00:16:40.438 --> 00:16:42.690
I got you. You punk.

00:16:43.274 --> 00:16:45.276
Your arm will break. Tap out!

00:16:46.861 --> 00:16:49.280
He's usually so strong.
Why is he so weak today?

00:16:49.364 --> 00:16:51.157
-Punk.
-I know, right?

00:16:51.241 --> 00:16:53.326
Hey, surrender. You'll break your arm.

00:16:55.662 --> 00:16:58.957
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:16:59.916
YOON BOM

00:17:02.043 --> 00:17:04.587
What… Why is Ms. Bom calling at this hour?

00:17:11.469 --> 00:17:12.887
Where are you going, punk?

00:17:18.768 --> 00:17:19.811
Answer it.

00:17:23.982 --> 00:17:24.816
Hi, Ms. Bom.

00:17:29.445 --> 00:17:33.658
You didn't disclose the major flaws
of the house. That's deceiving.

00:17:34.534 --> 00:17:38.079
You see, I let it slide
when grubs broke out in the yard.

00:17:38.621 --> 00:17:40.957
This time, there are a lot wasps

00:17:41.457 --> 00:17:43.960
flying around lately.
I can't live like this.

00:17:44.586 --> 00:17:45.420
Wasps?

00:17:46.254 --> 00:17:47.088
Wasps?

00:17:48.923 --> 00:17:51.050
Well, if you want to get rid of wasps,

00:17:51.134 --> 00:17:54.345
I think you should look
for an expert online.

00:18:01.102 --> 00:18:05.648
We will draw lots to decide on teams
for the Shinsu High Sports Festival!

00:18:06.482 --> 00:18:07.650
In this competition,

00:18:08.401 --> 00:18:12.655
medals will be given to everyone
on the winning team. Yes or no?

00:18:12.739 --> 00:18:14.324
-Yes!
-That's right.

00:18:14.407 --> 00:18:15.950
Yes!

00:18:16.034 --> 00:18:19.954
Now, second-year students,
please come up and draw lots.

00:18:20.038 --> 00:18:21.164
Come on up!

00:18:22.624 --> 00:18:25.084
GOOD AT EVERYTHING
SUN HAN-GYUL

00:18:25.168 --> 00:18:26.461
Han-gyul!

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.094
Team White!

00:18:35.178 --> 00:18:36.512
SO HANDSOME, SUN HAN-GYUL

00:18:40.725 --> 00:18:42.310
Team White!

00:18:47.649 --> 00:18:50.193
Team Blue!

00:18:55.823 --> 00:18:58.117
Team Blue!

00:19:00.912 --> 00:19:03.122
Team White!

00:19:03.206 --> 00:19:07.293
Ms. Bom, I was looking into some app
because of the wasps

00:19:07.377 --> 00:19:09.379
and found someone really good.

00:19:09.462 --> 00:19:10.546
Here, have a read.

00:19:11.255 --> 00:19:12.298
Team Blue!

00:19:12.382 --> 00:19:13.508
What is that?

00:19:13.591 --> 00:19:16.928
"Hello. I'm the Song Joong-ki of Shinsu,

00:19:17.428 --> 00:19:19.263
the youngest son of a rich family."

00:19:19.347 --> 00:19:21.182
"I'd like to introduce myself briefly."

00:19:22.016 --> 00:19:25.645
"When I was a baby, I learned to crawl
watching cockroaches crawling."

00:19:26.229 --> 00:19:28.564
"Battling ants over my meals

00:19:28.648 --> 00:19:30.483
and waging bloody wars with mosquitoes

00:19:30.566 --> 00:19:34.320
turned me into something
of an insecticide expert,

00:19:34.404 --> 00:19:38.616
especially when it comes
to dealing with wasps."

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:42.662
"I've never been able
to stand nectar-sucking insects,

00:19:42.745 --> 00:19:45.289
so I took out wasps whenever I saw them."

00:19:45.373 --> 00:19:48.626
"People even joked,
'Is he from a beekeeper family or what?'"

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:51.212
"'Why is he so good
at getting rid of wasps?'"

00:19:51.295 --> 00:19:55.049
"Hence, I ended up earning the title
'The Heir of the Wasp Family.'"

00:19:55.133 --> 00:19:57.677
"Is there a wasp nest at your house?"

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.846
"Did you get stung by a wasp today?"

00:19:59.929 --> 00:20:02.640
"If so, please contact me,
the Heir of the Wasp Family."

00:20:02.724 --> 00:20:04.058
"For just 20,000 won,

00:20:04.142 --> 00:20:08.271
I will take care of everything."
"No sticky hands guaranteed"?

00:20:08.771 --> 00:20:09.605
What do you think?

00:20:09.689 --> 00:20:12.567
Doesn't he sound legit?

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:14.652
-He's the real deal.
-"An heir."

00:20:14.736 --> 00:20:16.362
Next up are Ms. Seo Hye-suk

00:20:16.446 --> 00:20:18.364
and Ms. Yoon Bom. Please come up.

00:20:18.448 --> 00:20:21.242
All right. What will they draw?

00:20:21.909 --> 00:20:24.245
Let's go.

00:20:25.121 --> 00:20:27.373
Team Blue!

00:20:28.458 --> 00:20:30.543
Next, Ms. Yoon Bom.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.506
Team White!

00:20:36.966 --> 00:20:38.760
This is ridiculous.

00:20:40.011 --> 00:20:43.222
Take a look.
It looks like a Korean food buffet.

00:20:43.806 --> 00:20:47.685
Team Blue only has overly fermented
green onion kimchi and pickles.

00:20:50.063 --> 00:20:53.483
Bom, don't listen to him.
Don't say anything or get angry.

00:20:53.566 --> 00:20:55.026
Pickles?

00:20:55.651 --> 00:20:59.530
You're the one who's wrinkly like
dried fish. Who are you calling pickles?

00:20:59.614 --> 00:21:01.282
I wasn't talking about you.

00:21:01.365 --> 00:21:02.450
That doesn't matter.

00:21:02.533 --> 00:21:03.534
Calm down.

00:21:03.618 --> 00:21:07.872
The Superintendent of Education
and the governor might come that day.

00:21:07.955 --> 00:21:10.958
I think Mr. Hong's making a fuss
because he'd look bad to them.

00:21:12.376 --> 00:21:14.128
Put up with injustice.

00:21:14.212 --> 00:21:16.005
Come on, don't be like that.

00:21:16.089 --> 00:21:19.509
To make it fair,
let us swap team members, just one.

00:21:20.676 --> 00:21:23.012
Restrain yourself
from saying what's right.

00:21:23.805 --> 00:21:27.391
Well, I don't know.
I can't just tell them to swap teams.

00:21:27.475 --> 00:21:29.769
Unless someone wants to switch teams.

00:21:30.645 --> 00:21:31.687
Ms. Bom.

00:21:32.271 --> 00:21:33.981
You volunteer to switch teams.

00:21:35.399 --> 00:21:36.567
What are you saying?

00:21:38.111 --> 00:21:39.028
Why would I…

00:21:40.863 --> 00:21:41.948
Wait, Mr. Hong.

00:21:47.245 --> 00:21:48.454
YOON BOM

00:21:52.834 --> 00:21:53.835
Mr. Hong.

00:21:53.918 --> 00:21:55.086
YOON

00:22:03.678 --> 00:22:05.596
Where on earth did the white ball go?

00:22:06.222 --> 00:22:08.599
How could he change the decision
like that?

00:22:09.308 --> 00:22:11.936
Why not change the World Cup
draw results while he's at it?

00:22:15.356 --> 00:22:17.400
How should I take revenge on him?

00:22:18.151 --> 00:22:20.611
Do I have to join Team Blue
if you tell me to?

00:22:50.308 --> 00:22:51.184
Open up.

00:22:55.605 --> 00:22:56.731
-It's good.
-Really?

00:22:58.941 --> 00:23:00.651
Get better after eating this, okay?

00:23:25.134 --> 00:23:27.511
Congrats on passing
the teacher certification exam.

00:23:33.851 --> 00:23:35.770
Your baeksuk is the best.

00:23:35.853 --> 00:23:37.021
Yay!

00:23:58.376 --> 00:24:01.212
How does it taste the same
as my dad's baeksuk?

00:24:05.424 --> 00:24:09.220
Once you try it,
you'll definitely want to contact me.

00:24:14.642 --> 00:24:16.435
LAWYER CHOI I-JUN

00:24:25.152 --> 00:24:26.112
Right.

00:24:34.203 --> 00:24:35.579
Coming.

00:24:46.048 --> 00:24:47.717
The Heir of the Wasp Family, right?

00:25:06.902 --> 00:25:08.029
This way, please.

00:25:27.548 --> 00:25:29.675
See the tree with "Sun Jae-gyu" on it?

00:25:29.759 --> 00:25:31.594
I think that's the cause.

00:25:31.677 --> 00:25:35.014
You see, I've never watered it properly.

00:25:35.097 --> 00:25:38.476
Because I don't really care
whether it lives or dies.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:41.145
But it's so resilient.

00:25:41.228 --> 00:25:44.815
Every time I see it, it's grown.
Just like the person who gave it.

00:25:46.984 --> 00:25:51.197
I saw on the Internet that people usually
use gasoline or lacquer spray.

00:25:51.781 --> 00:25:53.491
How will you get rid of it with an axe?

00:25:56.077 --> 00:26:01.374
If you're worried about the tree,
I don't care if it breaks or gets hurt.

00:26:01.457 --> 00:26:02.625
So don't worry.

00:26:55.386 --> 00:26:56.595
Is it done already?

00:26:57.888 --> 00:27:00.349
I'll go get my wallet.
It's 20,000 won, right?

00:27:02.893 --> 00:27:04.770
I'm not that kind of person.

00:27:04.854 --> 00:27:07.648
I'm sure you've suffered
because of insects all your life.

00:27:07.731 --> 00:27:09.400
Of course I should pay you.

00:27:16.449 --> 00:27:17.533
By any chance,

00:27:19.034 --> 00:27:20.953
could you take care of that one as well?

00:27:21.829 --> 00:27:24.165
I think it'll be infested with bugs soon,

00:27:24.248 --> 00:27:26.792
so I'd like to deal with it
if the price is right.

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:32.298
You mean 20,000 won?

00:27:33.507 --> 00:27:34.717
Please do it right away.

00:27:58.574 --> 00:28:01.410
Sir, take a break and have this.

00:28:02.203 --> 00:28:03.746
How many grains are in it?

00:28:15.049 --> 00:28:17.468
What a good worker.

00:28:21.222 --> 00:28:23.140
If I'd known there was

00:28:23.224 --> 00:28:26.227
such a good worker who works so quietly,

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:28.187
I would've called for help sooner.

00:28:32.858 --> 00:28:33.734
It's him.

00:28:35.486 --> 00:28:36.737
Mr. Choi I-jun.

00:28:37.488 --> 00:28:39.156
Thank you for the baeksuk.

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:41.909
I couldn't help but call you,
like you said.

00:28:42.451 --> 00:28:44.662
It tastes exactly
like what I was looking for.

00:28:45.371 --> 00:28:47.998
Especially the bittersweet aftertaste.

00:28:48.082 --> 00:28:51.335
No restaurant has recreated that taste.

00:28:55.089 --> 00:28:57.091
Seriously? You'll give me
the secret recipe?

00:28:57.675 --> 00:29:00.678
Okay. Then, at 5:00 p.m. on the 24th,

00:29:00.761 --> 00:29:02.721
I'll see you at Two Cups of Coffee.

00:29:51.228 --> 00:29:52.521
Heave-ho!

00:30:02.114 --> 00:30:03.449
"Heave-ho"?

00:30:08.203 --> 00:30:09.121
So…

00:30:13.459 --> 00:30:16.754
His uncle is...
the Heir of the Wasp Family?

00:31:06.553 --> 00:31:08.847
Did you finish it?
Anything you don't understand?

00:31:09.682 --> 00:31:10.516
There is.

00:31:11.141 --> 00:31:12.184
Why won't you ask me?

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:15.479
Because I wouldn't teach you
if I were you.

00:31:17.231 --> 00:31:18.440
You got me wrong.

00:31:18.941 --> 00:31:21.902
I wouldn't lose to you
even if I taught you a little.

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:24.405
Is that so?

00:31:26.365 --> 00:31:27.574
Then teach me.

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:33.539
Let's not calculate them one by one
and just list them.

00:31:34.123 --> 00:31:37.334
Sigma k from one to ten…

00:31:37.418 --> 00:31:38.711
K cubed equals…

00:31:39.878 --> 00:31:40.963
Two-tenths…

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:47.469
It's 3,025.

00:32:10.284 --> 00:32:11.160
I knew it.

00:32:11.702 --> 00:32:13.245
What are you doing?

00:32:13.829 --> 00:32:16.206
I knew you weren't athletic.

00:32:17.833 --> 00:32:19.793
Team White's captain, Evil Han-gyul.

00:32:20.961 --> 00:32:23.839
Have you ever seen me laugh?

00:32:26.759 --> 00:32:28.719
You'll see it at the sports festival.

00:32:29.887 --> 00:32:32.639
Because I will crush you.

00:32:35.601 --> 00:32:37.895
Let's take a photo together that day.

00:32:39.104 --> 00:32:42.566
I want to capture
my victorious smile next to a loser.

00:32:56.497 --> 00:32:57.539
It was so hot.

00:33:00.751 --> 00:33:01.585
Well,

00:33:02.169 --> 00:33:05.672
I disguised myself perfectly.
How did you know?

00:33:06.465 --> 00:33:10.803
Who would have dragon tattoos on their arm
except for you, Mr. Sun Jae-gyu?

00:33:13.347 --> 00:33:16.517
I happened to overhear Ms. Seo
talking to you on the phone.

00:33:17.184 --> 00:33:18.727
I thought you needed help.

00:33:19.561 --> 00:33:22.231
I told you to stay out of my business.

00:33:22.856 --> 00:33:24.149
Are you a stalker?

00:33:24.983 --> 00:33:27.820
Stalkers follow people around
to hurt them.

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:30.030
I wanted to help you.

00:33:31.365 --> 00:33:32.199
Look.

00:33:33.033 --> 00:33:35.953
I got rid of the wasps and chopped down
the tree. Is that so wrong?

00:33:36.036 --> 00:33:37.871
An unwanted approach is rude.

00:33:37.955 --> 00:33:39.081
I…

00:33:42.709 --> 00:33:46.004
I thought I made you upset,
so I wanted to make you feel better.

00:33:46.088 --> 00:33:48.674
Unwanted help is just a pain.

00:33:51.593 --> 00:33:52.719
"A pain"?

00:33:55.222 --> 00:33:57.266
Did you just say "a pain"?

00:33:59.518 --> 00:34:00.519
It's 40,000 won, right?

00:34:03.146 --> 00:34:05.607
The way out is that way.

00:34:12.573 --> 00:34:15.492
I was actually going to leave soon, okay?

00:34:15.576 --> 00:34:18.620
There are so many people
asking for my services.

00:34:19.746 --> 00:34:21.081
Goodness.

00:34:21.665 --> 00:34:23.375
I really might end up being rich!

00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:28.463
She has no idea how I feel.

00:35:15.928 --> 00:35:18.013
He knocked someone down yesterday.

00:35:18.722 --> 00:35:21.266
Who's he going to beat up today?

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:25.437
He should've understood when I told him.

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.064
Why did he come here again?

00:35:30.859 --> 00:35:32.361
Draw the line, Bom.

00:35:33.779 --> 00:35:35.280
He's your student's uncle.

00:35:50.337 --> 00:35:51.672
I really enjoyed it.

00:35:52.255 --> 00:35:54.925
I know it's bad manners
to give the container back empty,

00:35:55.008 --> 00:35:56.593
but I have nothing to give you.

00:35:56.677 --> 00:35:57.970
The coffee's on me.

00:36:05.227 --> 00:36:06.979
This café's identity is…

00:36:09.481 --> 00:36:12.776
Coffee, ssanghwa tea and pumpkin porridge.

00:36:14.027 --> 00:36:17.656
It's like a combination
of traditional music and hip-hop.

00:36:18.615 --> 00:36:21.618
I like coffee with acidity,
like Ethiopian Sidamo

00:36:21.702 --> 00:36:23.245
or Kenya AA.

00:36:24.121 --> 00:36:26.832
But every café in this area uses Robusta.

00:36:26.915 --> 00:36:30.877
If you like coffee with acidity,
there's Camil Coffee on Rodeo Street.

00:36:30.961 --> 00:36:33.088
What? That's my favorite coffee shop.

00:36:33.797 --> 00:36:35.340
Have you tried their signature?

00:36:36.091 --> 00:36:36.967
Orange Einspänner.

00:36:42.305 --> 00:36:43.890
Here's your pumpkin porridge.

00:36:47.561 --> 00:36:50.897
You didn't even try this. This place's
signature is pumpkin porridge.

00:36:58.405 --> 00:37:00.741
By the way,
you're not asking the question.

00:37:01.616 --> 00:37:02.451
Sorry?

00:37:03.285 --> 00:37:04.327
What question?

00:37:04.411 --> 00:37:08.540
Well, there's this question
everyone here asks me.

00:37:09.166 --> 00:37:10.917
"Why did you come down here?"

00:37:11.001 --> 00:37:12.711
"What happened in Seoul?"

00:37:12.794 --> 00:37:14.421
Because some things

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:17.382
are painful just to bring up.

00:37:20.802 --> 00:37:21.762
Country people,

00:37:22.804 --> 00:37:25.766
they always cross the line.
They have no sense of boundaries.

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:31.063
They meddle when they show interest
and interrogate when they ask questions.

00:37:33.815 --> 00:37:35.567
I feel like the thoughts in my head

00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:38.028
just came out of your mouth.

00:37:38.111 --> 00:37:42.908
What people like us need most
is graceful indifference.

00:38:15.816 --> 00:38:17.109
I'm so pathetic.

00:38:18.819 --> 00:38:20.862
Why did I even go there to listen to them?

00:38:24.574 --> 00:38:25.408
But, son...

00:38:26.576 --> 00:38:28.620
I'm old-fashioned,

00:38:29.204 --> 00:38:30.956
so if I like someone, I show it,

00:38:31.039 --> 00:38:34.292
and if they need help, I help them.
That's all I know.

00:38:35.502 --> 00:38:39.798
This line that Seoul people talk about,
I have no idea where it lies.

00:38:41.174 --> 00:38:42.342
Bom-sik, what about you?

00:38:44.136 --> 00:38:47.305
Do you know what graceful indifference is?

00:38:47.889 --> 00:38:48.974
Do you know

00:38:49.057 --> 00:38:52.686
any way to make up with your mom
without crossing the line?

00:38:56.189 --> 00:38:58.525
Say something, Bom-sik.

00:39:22.757 --> 00:39:26.845
Seriously, did Bom finish it all?

00:39:26.928 --> 00:39:30.182
Now that the delivery's complete,
please tell me.

00:39:31.474 --> 00:39:34.895
How did you
lose contact with your daughter?

00:39:43.153 --> 00:39:43.987
I'll sue them.

00:39:44.863 --> 00:39:48.700
The parents are in the wrong.
Why did I have to be humiliated like that?

00:39:49.409 --> 00:39:50.410
Don't.

00:39:53.788 --> 00:39:54.873
Mom.

00:39:55.498 --> 00:39:58.293
What did you... just say?

00:39:59.544 --> 00:40:02.172
Before you're a teacher,
you're Jeong Nan-hee's daughter.

00:40:03.006 --> 00:40:06.927
"The adulterous teacher is Jeong Nan-hee's
daughter." "A scandal with a married man."

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:10.263
If such articles get published,
who will take the blow?

00:40:10.347 --> 00:40:13.225
Mom, you're only thinking
about yourself in this situation?

00:40:13.975 --> 00:40:17.187
Right now, this is
the only way to prove my innocence.

00:40:17.771 --> 00:40:20.106
You think people are interested
in your innocence?

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:23.401
What they're interested in
is not the truth, it's gossip.

00:40:29.616 --> 00:40:30.700
Dad.

00:40:33.495 --> 00:40:35.956
What needs to be done needs to be done.

00:40:37.415 --> 00:40:39.000
I don't want to bury this.

00:40:39.084 --> 00:40:41.211
Once it's buried, it's tough to dig it up.

00:40:41.836 --> 00:40:46.758
I'll end up… living as a teacher
who had an affair with a parent.

00:40:46.841 --> 00:40:47.676
Please?

00:40:49.636 --> 00:40:50.470
Bom.

00:40:52.222 --> 00:40:53.390
Is it…

00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:57.394
really not true?

00:41:03.441 --> 00:41:05.443
I didn't say that just for my sake.

00:41:05.527 --> 00:41:07.279
It would've been worse for Bom.

00:41:07.862 --> 00:41:10.782
Because she is the daughter
of celebrity, Jeong Nan-hee,

00:41:10.865 --> 00:41:13.660
it would've been
exaggerated and distorted.

00:41:15.328 --> 00:41:17.747
Even still, she's your daughter.

00:41:18.331 --> 00:41:20.875
I shouldn't have done that
to Bom back then.

00:41:23.253 --> 00:41:24.671
Speaking of which…

00:41:31.011 --> 00:41:32.345
What is all this?

00:41:33.471 --> 00:41:36.766
The evidence Bom gathered
to file a lawsuit.

00:41:41.396 --> 00:41:43.189
Now that we've found Bom,

00:41:43.273 --> 00:41:46.109
I want to move ahead
with the lawsuit again.

00:41:47.527 --> 00:41:50.113
I believe it's the only way
for us to make up with her.

00:41:50.864 --> 00:41:55.076
Attorney Choi, can you help us this once?

00:42:01.541 --> 00:42:02.417
TEAM BLUE'S PARENTS

00:42:05.545 --> 00:42:06.588
TEAM WHITE'S PARENTS

00:42:10.008 --> 00:42:11.009
PARENT-TEACHER MEETING

00:42:11.092 --> 00:42:15.472
You know that the teachers and students
are divided into two teams, right?

00:42:15.555 --> 00:42:16.723
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:42:16.806 --> 00:42:17.974
Principal.

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:21.353
I think there's someone here
who's not an official member.

00:42:21.436 --> 00:42:22.479
Pardon?

00:42:24.522 --> 00:42:25.398
I think it's me.

00:42:31.529 --> 00:42:34.657
I'm Choi I-jun, the older brother
of Choi Se-jin, a second-year student.

00:42:36.034 --> 00:42:38.870
It would've been appropriate
for my parents to come,

00:42:38.953 --> 00:42:41.122
but they're busy with the inauguration,

00:42:41.915 --> 00:42:44.209
so I came on their behalf.

00:42:44.793 --> 00:42:48.046
"On their behalf"?
This isn't some neighborhood meeting.

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:56.596
I've reviewed
the parent-teacher meeting regulations,

00:42:56.679 --> 00:42:58.681
and this doesn't violate any legally.

00:42:59.182 --> 00:43:00.100
As it happens,

00:43:00.183 --> 00:43:01.518
SCHOOL RULES AND POLICIES

00:43:01.601 --> 00:43:03.603
I'm a lawyer.

00:43:09.317 --> 00:43:10.360
First thing,

00:43:10.443 --> 00:43:14.280
is there a volunteer to be the leader
of the parents on Team White?

00:43:21.287 --> 00:43:23.331
Bom-sik, Mom's here.

00:43:23.415 --> 00:43:24.749
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:43:24.833 --> 00:43:26.126
You came.

00:43:26.209 --> 00:43:27.252
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

00:43:28.795 --> 00:43:29.963
Bom-sik.

00:43:36.886 --> 00:43:38.138
What?

00:43:39.431 --> 00:43:42.016
Gosh, it was here.

00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:44.269
I must've left it here last time.

00:43:44.352 --> 00:43:47.063
Bom-sik, this is the ball I drew.

00:43:47.147 --> 00:43:48.565
Do you want it?

00:43:48.648 --> 00:43:49.816
-Do you?
-Team White.

00:43:51.526 --> 00:43:55.363
You see, Mommy came up with a plan
to win for sure at the sports festival.

00:44:01.828 --> 00:44:07.292
Okay. Then I'll win at all costs
and get the medal for you, Bom-sik.

00:44:07.375 --> 00:44:08.501
You trust me, right?

00:44:13.173 --> 00:44:14.382
I'll do it.

00:44:17.719 --> 00:44:18.970
Any objections?

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:25.143
All right. The leader for Team White
has now been decided.

00:44:25.226 --> 00:44:28.313
What about Team Blue?
Who will be the leader?

00:44:33.526 --> 00:44:34.777
I'll do it.

00:44:34.861 --> 00:44:38.490
Se-jin told me that you're on Team Blue.

00:44:39.449 --> 00:44:40.617
I am on Team Blue, but…

00:44:41.201 --> 00:44:44.579
Se-jin seemed so determined
to win this sports festival.

00:44:44.662 --> 00:44:46.706
I'm as determined as she is.

00:44:47.373 --> 00:44:50.710
The medal will be around my neck
when it ends, no matter what.

00:44:57.133 --> 00:45:00.345
Oh, my. It's been decided so quickly.

00:45:00.428 --> 00:45:02.305
Okay, that's final.

00:45:02.388 --> 00:45:03.640
Now, you two,

00:45:03.723 --> 00:45:06.893
why don't you come forward
and shake hands?

00:45:12.815 --> 00:45:14.108
Come closer.

00:45:46.391 --> 00:45:49.143
All right. Exercising is
all about stamina.

00:45:49.894 --> 00:45:51.271
At this sports festival,

00:45:51.354 --> 00:45:54.315
the tug-of-war will draw
the most attention,

00:45:54.399 --> 00:45:56.568
and stamina will determine the winner.

00:45:57.151 --> 00:45:59.862
Make sure everyone's ready, okay?

00:45:59.946 --> 00:46:01.030
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

00:46:01.114 --> 00:46:02.031
INSTRUCTOR

00:46:02.115 --> 00:46:03.283
Uncle.

00:46:03.366 --> 00:46:04.701
Do we have to go this far?

00:46:04.784 --> 00:46:06.202
Yes, we do.

00:46:06.286 --> 00:46:08.413
I mean, we're supposed to enjoy the day.

00:46:08.496 --> 00:46:09.998
Must we do this to win?

00:46:10.081 --> 00:46:12.083
Yes. All right.

00:46:13.793 --> 00:46:18.464
Competition might be painful,
but it brings you great achievements.

00:46:18.548 --> 00:46:21.134
And through this sports festival,

00:46:21.217 --> 00:46:23.261
all of you will learn that lesson.

00:46:23.344 --> 00:46:25.680
Who wants to learn that here?

00:46:26.431 --> 00:46:27.974
Can't you see they're sleepy?

00:46:35.773 --> 00:46:36.733
Are you sleepy?

00:46:36.816 --> 00:46:38.151
No, sir!

00:46:38.234 --> 00:46:40.028
All right, everyone open your eyes!

00:46:40.695 --> 00:46:42.363
You can sleep when you're dead.

00:46:43.906 --> 00:46:46.868
Now, everyone grab the rope
in front of you.

00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:50.747
Move faster!

00:46:51.998 --> 00:46:55.627
After the training,
I'll check your breath.

00:46:56.210 --> 00:47:00.632
If I smell toothpaste from your mouth,
it means you haven't trained properly.

00:47:00.715 --> 00:47:03.843
From now on,
until your breath smells like anchovies,

00:47:03.926 --> 00:47:05.803
pull the rope. Understood?

00:47:05.887 --> 00:47:07.263
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

00:47:08.973 --> 00:47:10.350
Pull!

00:47:10.433 --> 00:47:11.934
Pull!

00:47:13.019 --> 00:47:13.853
Hey, pull!

00:47:13.936 --> 00:47:15.521
Pull!

00:47:18.566 --> 00:47:20.276
Pull!

00:47:26.199 --> 00:47:27.533
Pull!

00:47:34.165 --> 00:47:36.709
Pull harder! Team White!

00:47:36.793 --> 00:47:39.212
Let's say their weight is 1,000 kg

00:47:39.796 --> 00:47:42.674
and our weight is 900 kg.

00:47:43.383 --> 00:47:45.385
If they stand in a single line...

00:47:46.803 --> 00:47:48.429
and we stand in two lines,

00:47:49.055 --> 00:47:52.266
since their 1,000 kg force
will be pulled diagonally--

00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:53.184
Sir.

00:47:54.352 --> 00:47:56.562
Why do we have to know this?

00:47:58.648 --> 00:48:00.692
General Kang Kam-chan once said

00:48:01.275 --> 00:48:04.737
that force is always defeated by wisdom.

00:48:04.821 --> 00:48:08.950
You and the general must not know this
since you've never lost in your life.

00:48:09.033 --> 00:48:10.952
If you give up, your life gets easier.

00:48:11.703 --> 00:48:14.205
I'm sure you're all hungry.
Let's just go eat.

00:48:15.581 --> 00:48:17.500
Mattis Donuts!

00:48:29.345 --> 00:48:31.806
Aren't those the Mattis Donuts
that went viral on Instar?

00:48:31.889 --> 00:48:33.891
They're hard to get, even in Seoul.

00:48:33.975 --> 00:48:35.810
How long will you eat nothing but rice?

00:48:46.946 --> 00:48:50.450
This rich cream and soft, fluffy pastry.

00:48:50.533 --> 00:48:53.786
Behold. This is the taste of Seoul.

00:49:00.418 --> 00:49:02.545
Students who attend the strategy meeting

00:49:02.628 --> 00:49:05.089
will be provided
with a different dessert every time.

00:49:05.173 --> 00:49:06.799
And if Team Blue wins,

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:12.263
the best salt bread
from Eclani in Seonggu-dong

00:49:12.346 --> 00:49:13.639
will be given to you.

00:49:13.723 --> 00:49:15.391
Hooray for Team Blue!

00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:18.102
-Team Blue!
-Team Blue!

00:49:18.186 --> 00:49:20.521
-Team Blue!
-Team Blue!

00:49:20.605 --> 00:49:23.149
-Team Blue!
-Team Blue!

00:49:23.232 --> 00:49:24.692
-Team Blue!
-Team Blue!

00:49:49.425 --> 00:49:51.052
Did you get the tissues ready?

00:49:51.761 --> 00:49:55.223
You'll end up weeping and sniffling.
You'll need boxes of them.

00:49:56.015 --> 00:49:58.184
Prepare wet wipes if possible.

00:49:59.101 --> 00:50:02.396
Blowing your nose with tissues
will make your nose chafe.

00:50:10.947 --> 00:50:11.781
Me?

00:50:18.162 --> 00:50:19.038
Hey.

00:50:20.164 --> 00:50:21.207
Did you encourage him?

00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:22.542
What do you mean?

00:50:22.625 --> 00:50:26.128
Because I said I'd beat you,
you dragged your uncle into this.

00:50:26.212 --> 00:50:29.924
My uncle and I have never talked
about the sports festival.

00:50:30.007 --> 00:50:32.552
Then why is your uncle
so passionate about it?

00:50:34.595 --> 00:50:35.429
I mean,

00:50:36.222 --> 00:50:40.226
isn't it unfair for your uncle
to participate in the sports festival?

00:50:40.935 --> 00:50:44.021
It's like a professional Go player
competing against an amateur

00:50:44.105 --> 00:50:46.190
or a pop star
competing against an amateur.

00:50:46.274 --> 00:50:48.109
I admit that,

00:50:48.192 --> 00:50:51.529
but my uncle doesn't change his mind
once he decides on something.

00:50:52.113 --> 00:50:54.240
I tried to stop him many times today,

00:50:54.323 --> 00:50:55.616
but it didn't work at all.

00:50:56.826 --> 00:50:58.578
-You tried to stop him?
-I did.

00:51:06.419 --> 00:51:07.378
You know...

00:51:08.462 --> 00:51:10.172
You have a way of confusing me.

00:51:13.676 --> 00:51:16.387
Sometimes it feels like
you're trying to screw me over,

00:51:17.513 --> 00:51:19.432
and sometimes like
you're trying to help me.

00:51:23.519 --> 00:51:24.687
Which one is it?

00:51:26.814 --> 00:51:28.190
Good or evil?

00:51:34.155 --> 00:51:37.074
Bom-sik. Good dog.

00:51:37.158 --> 00:51:39.535
Bom-sik, let's play.

00:51:47.919 --> 00:51:49.128
Good dog.

00:51:49.211 --> 00:51:50.671
Yes! Good dog!

00:51:50.755 --> 00:51:52.131
Gosh, you're like a person.

00:51:52.214 --> 00:51:53.716
You're human now.

00:51:53.799 --> 00:51:57.136
Good job.
Bom-sik, you're a genius, aren't you?

00:51:57.219 --> 00:51:59.013
Good job, my baby.

00:52:08.856 --> 00:52:12.068
Bom-sik, Mommy's busy
with preparations for the sports festival,

00:52:12.151 --> 00:52:14.737
so I'll get going. Tell him that for me.

00:52:16.197 --> 00:52:19.367
Can you ask her
if she sees any more wasps?

00:52:20.618 --> 00:52:23.537
Well, I don't see any now.

00:52:24.205 --> 00:52:27.124
And ask her what happened
to the grubs in the yard.

00:52:27.208 --> 00:52:28.876
They're gone too.

00:52:32.296 --> 00:52:36.509
Your dad may lack sensibility
and be tacky in some ways,

00:52:37.009 --> 00:52:40.179
but when he does something,
he gets it done. Tell her that.

00:52:40.763 --> 00:52:45.559
Ask him if he wants me
to say thank you, then.

00:52:45.643 --> 00:52:48.062
I'm not saying I want to hear that,

00:52:48.938 --> 00:52:51.607
but I don't want her to get me wrong.
Tell her that.

00:53:00.992 --> 00:53:01.826
Here.

00:53:02.493 --> 00:53:03.577
This is

00:53:04.161 --> 00:53:06.914
the money your dad earned
working part-time. It's for you.

00:53:07.873 --> 00:53:12.169
Seoul people may feel comfortable
with setting the bill so accurately,

00:53:12.253 --> 00:53:16.215
but people here
feel so uncomfortable with it.

00:53:16.882 --> 00:53:18.634
Bom-sik, use it for your snacks.

00:53:25.391 --> 00:53:28.352
Your dad is the leader
of the parents on Team White.

00:53:28.436 --> 00:53:32.523
I will win at all costs
and get you the medal, Bom-sik.

00:53:32.606 --> 00:53:33.941
You can look forward to it.

00:53:34.775 --> 00:53:35.609
Okay?

00:53:40.906 --> 00:53:41.782
I'm off.

00:54:16.609 --> 00:54:18.861
SHINSU HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS FESTIVAL

00:54:18.944 --> 00:54:21.906
FIGHT AND WIN!
TEAM WHITE! LET'S GO!

00:54:21.989 --> 00:54:23.574
TEAM WHITE
TEAM BLUE

00:54:23.657 --> 00:54:25.785
PERFECT LIKE A GOD!
SUN HAN-GYUL!

00:54:25.868 --> 00:54:27.953
OUR HERO!
SUN HAN-GYUL, LET'S GO!

00:54:56.816 --> 00:54:57.691
What is it?

00:55:01.737 --> 00:55:02.988
-Uncle.
-What?

00:55:06.033 --> 00:55:06.951
What is it?

00:55:12.790 --> 00:55:14.542
Do you want something from me?

00:55:15.209 --> 00:55:16.502
You want more allowance?

00:55:18.629 --> 00:55:19.755
Can you not come to...

00:55:21.006 --> 00:55:21.882
the sports festival?

00:55:25.469 --> 00:55:26.303
What?

00:55:29.723 --> 00:55:31.725
You've been acting strange.

00:55:32.476 --> 00:55:34.687
Why do you keep complaining
about the sports fest?

00:55:35.604 --> 00:55:38.858
And you? Why are you so desperate to win?
You even trained the kids.

00:55:41.652 --> 00:55:44.321
Isn't it such a good opportunity?

00:55:44.405 --> 00:55:47.533
Kids these days don't move much
since they study all the time.

00:55:48.409 --> 00:55:52.538
They get to improve their stamina
and learn to work as a team, and…

00:55:52.621 --> 00:55:53.539
And?

00:55:54.623 --> 00:55:55.916
And, you know…

00:55:58.210 --> 00:55:59.753
Your homeroom teacher wants to win.

00:55:59.837 --> 00:56:00.880
What?

00:56:01.881 --> 00:56:05.050
If she wins, she'll feel good.

00:56:05.134 --> 00:56:07.428
If she feels good, she'll teach you better

00:56:07.511 --> 00:56:10.764
and take better care
of you and your classmates.

00:56:10.848 --> 00:56:13.559
If you want her to win,
you shouldn't participate.

00:56:14.602 --> 00:56:15.603
What do you mean?

00:56:15.686 --> 00:56:18.480
She's... on Team Blue.

00:56:18.564 --> 00:56:19.523
Gosh.

00:56:20.316 --> 00:56:21.483
She's on Team White.

00:56:21.567 --> 00:56:22.526
She's on Team Blue.

00:56:22.610 --> 00:56:24.236
She's on Team White, you punk.

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:27.615
I saw her holding a white ball
with my own eyes.

00:56:28.199 --> 00:56:29.533
But it changed.

00:56:31.577 --> 00:56:32.453
What changed?

00:56:32.536 --> 00:56:34.496
Se-jin saw it in the teachers' office.

00:56:35.289 --> 00:56:38.667
Hong Jung-pyo put her on his team,
saying his team was too weak.

00:56:39.501 --> 00:56:42.254
Because both Ms. Bom and Se-jin
are on Team Blue,

00:56:42.338 --> 00:56:43.839
Se-jin's brother's making a fuss.

00:56:49.303 --> 00:56:50.137
Uncle.

00:56:51.388 --> 00:56:54.934
I don't care whether we win
the stupid sports festival or not,

00:56:55.017 --> 00:56:56.352
so don't participate.

00:56:56.435 --> 00:56:58.729
So that she can win. Okay?

00:57:00.314 --> 00:57:02.399
You won't, right? Right?

00:57:03.108 --> 00:57:04.985
-Let go of me.
-Why?

00:57:18.832 --> 00:57:21.835
Sir! We gathered
and pulled the tire again yesterday.

00:57:22.336 --> 00:57:24.964
Do you want to smell my breath?
It's brutal.

00:57:29.969 --> 00:57:30.970
Good job.

00:57:32.471 --> 00:57:34.390
Everyone, keep your eyes open!

00:57:35.307 --> 00:57:37.226
You can sleep when you're dead.

00:57:41.730 --> 00:57:45.234
Well, you know, sufficient sleep

00:57:45.818 --> 00:57:48.862
is essential for students
who are still growing.

00:57:49.571 --> 00:57:54.451
Excessive competition
is what ails this era,

00:57:54.535 --> 00:57:58.622
and participation
is more important than winning.

00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:03.252
So don't be obsessed with winning,

00:58:03.335 --> 00:58:04.378
and just enjoy it.

00:58:04.962 --> 00:58:06.922
Okay? Good.

00:58:07.006 --> 00:58:07.840
Master.

00:58:07.923 --> 00:58:10.092
I think your pep talk has changed a bit.

00:58:11.593 --> 00:58:13.887
Why aren't you wearing our team T-shirt?

00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:37.077
ONE HEART SPORTS FESTIVAL

00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:47.755
Choi I-jun.

00:58:49.590 --> 00:58:52.760
In tug-of-war,
you should use your legs, not your arms.

00:58:52.843 --> 00:58:53.886
Okay?

00:58:55.429 --> 00:58:58.057
Embrace your core until the match ends,

00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:01.477
and pull with all your might
with your hip and thigh muscles.

00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:02.686
Understand?

00:59:07.691 --> 00:59:08.817
What do you think?

00:59:10.277 --> 00:59:11.153
What do you mean?

00:59:12.237 --> 00:59:16.241
Isn't this place nice and quiet
for us to take a picture later?

00:59:18.369 --> 00:59:20.037
That's if I win.

00:59:21.747 --> 00:59:23.123
You asked me last time

00:59:24.375 --> 00:59:28.253
if my intentions were good or evil.

00:59:29.129 --> 00:59:29.963
So?

00:59:30.047 --> 00:59:34.802
Once the sports festival ends,
you'll know the answer.

00:59:38.055 --> 00:59:39.431
I won't participate.

00:59:41.892 --> 00:59:43.352
Don't be ridiculous.

00:59:43.435 --> 00:59:47.064
If I participate,
I'll join the military again.

00:59:48.315 --> 00:59:50.734
I'll only eat vegetables
at barbecue places,

00:59:51.443 --> 00:59:53.904
and I'll call you "honey"
for the rest of my life.

00:59:53.987 --> 00:59:55.030
Believe me now?

00:59:55.114 --> 00:59:56.907
Why the sudden change of heart?

01:00:00.035 --> 01:00:02.830
So win no matter what, okay?

01:00:03.497 --> 01:00:04.873
Team Blue.

01:00:05.499 --> 01:00:06.333
Good luck.

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:11.213
The homeroom teacher's here!

01:00:36.155 --> 01:00:37.281
Why would I…

01:00:44.788 --> 01:00:46.373
Gosh, it was here.

01:00:52.045 --> 01:00:53.297
I am on Team Blue, but…

01:01:15.986 --> 01:01:16.904
Team White?

01:01:17.863 --> 01:01:18.697
Team White?

01:01:23.285 --> 01:01:26.246
Team White, are you ready to win?

01:01:26.330 --> 01:01:27.706
Let's go!

01:02:08.038 --> 01:02:09.623
Use your legs!

01:02:10.874 --> 01:02:12.251
I need you, Mr. Sun.

01:02:12.334 --> 01:02:13.418
Please?

01:02:13.502 --> 01:02:15.212
I'm just as upset.

01:02:16.713 --> 01:02:17.548
Who are you?

01:02:17.631 --> 01:02:20.050
I'm here to see Mr. Sun Jae-gyu.

01:02:20.133 --> 01:02:22.636
Her smile. That's all I want to see.

01:02:22.719 --> 01:02:24.429
It's the same for me.

01:02:25.764 --> 01:02:28.267
It's all done, Bom-sik's house.

01:02:28.350 --> 01:02:29.560
I love you.

01:02:33.355 --> 01:02:35.357
