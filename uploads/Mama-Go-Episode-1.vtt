WEBVTT

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.399
Hello, hello, hello.

00:00:28.879 --> 00:00:29.399
Sound check.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.920
One two, one two.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.560
This is the Third Expeditionary Division

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.479
Scout A Fu's

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.359
1,067th work report.

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:43.000
Since departing from home Planet B2526,

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:44.039
I have been carrying the goal

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:47.640
of finding a source of Life Energy for our race.

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:50.520
Following the distant Centaurus constellation,

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:52.600
I arrived at the edge of the Milky Way,

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:53.759
in the Solar System.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.079
Here lies the ringed Saturn,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.320
the eerie Jupiter,

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:58.960
the bright red Mars,

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.759
and a special

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.920
blue planet rich in Life Energy:

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.400
Earth.

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.439
I believe this planet is highly worth exploring.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.480
Because their planet, like ours,

00:01:12.599 --> 00:01:14.120
has fair

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:15.159
transactions.

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:18.079
This allows our expedition plan's strategy

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.599
of collecting commission fees via Life Transactions

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:22.599
to be successfully implemented.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.760
But there are some baffling life relationships here

00:01:25.879 --> 00:01:28.239
that our planet has never seen.

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.719
Mom.

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:30.040
Close relationships.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.680
Mom.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.680
I will seek out the possibility

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.760
of trading Life Energy on this planet

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:40.200
and bring back more information to the home planet.

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:42.439
Please rest assured, home planet.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.879
Report concluded.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.519
Hello.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.760
Specially designed for Earth clients,

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.959
the Life Transaction package.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.439
Would you like to know more?

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.959
Trading 25 years of your Life Energy

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.120
to your sick loved one

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:02.400
can give them a new life, bring them back from the dead.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.599
For a loved one,

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:06.159
trading 25 years of your Life Energy...

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.840
is it not worth it?

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.400
25 years for my dad's health is too long.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.080
My dad would feel bad for me too.

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:13.800
Is it not worth it?

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.639
How about two years?

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:17.800
Can I just buy it with money?

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.080
Name your price.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.560
Doctor, there's a nutjob here.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.960
Doctor!

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.000
I'm a caregiver.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.560
Is there a 7-day no-questions-asked return policy?

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:33.159
Can we haggle?

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:34.400
Someone's running a scam here!

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:36.319
I didn't understand just now.

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.199
You're interested, right?

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:45.000
Let me introduce it to you.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.400
Great, great!

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.280
The human world is not worth it.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.520
Plants are more compassionate.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.520
This is our Pact.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.280
No negative reviews in 672 years.

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:55.400
Honest and fair.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.240
You can give a portion of your Life Energy

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.159
to this dying seedling.

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.039
It can use your Life Energy

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.240
to survive and sprout.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.599
Completely painless.

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.599
All you have to do is sign the Pact.

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:09.759
I'll handle the rest for you.

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:10.199
How about it?

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.199
Then I'll press your leaf print.

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:18.680
Once the Pact is in effect, no take-backs.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.199
Then our

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.800
Pact is established.

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:50.840
Congratulations, Mother Tree.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.479
You have become our

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.680
entire Solar System's

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:55.120
second customer.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.560
Remember to give a Five-star rating, dear.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.639
Uncle, are you doing magic?

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.759
Little boy.

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:08.319
Do you want to get better quickly?

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:09.719
Do you want to grow up healthy?

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:13.080
Then, who in this world likes you

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.280
and loves you the most?

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:16.480
It's my Mom.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.000
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.680
Don't hit me! Don't hit me!

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.160
Don't run!

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.040
Mom! Mom!

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.040
Kong Xiaocan, you little brat!

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:21.879
How dare you lie to me and skip school!

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:22.959
Stand right there!

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:34.360
Missed me!

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.959
Son

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:52.160
Son

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.079
Son

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.759
Where are you hurt, Son?

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.879
Mom, you hit way too hard.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.000
Didn't you fall on your own?

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:01.879
Come on, get up.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.319
Where does it hurt?

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:04.879
Mom... Mom will take you to the hospital.

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:20.759
My mother,

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.600
Ms. Kong Guifang,

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:24.720
when she was young,

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:27.399
was both beautiful and trendy.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.439
Even as time passed,

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.120
from her, you could not

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.399
see the traces left by the years.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.240
Because she took even the traces with her.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.800
Even so,

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:46.120
the her of today

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.160
still holds herself to high standards.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.319
She not only embodies

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.759
the fine qualities of a middle-aged woman,

00:05:52.959 --> 00:05:53.839
but also

00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:56.639
displays them to the fullest.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.680
She is thrifty.

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:32.439
She loves flowers

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.079
Loves floral prints

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:43.079
I... I want this bag, there's more in this bag

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.959
Okay, okay, thank you

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.439
She is exceptionally intelligent

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:50.319
Thank you

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:51.639
Take another one

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.600
She is gentle and kind

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.560
Kong Xiaocan

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.680
Get up

00:06:58.519 --> 00:07:00.040
Playing dead in this bed, get up now

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:00.680
That's me

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.639
Kong Xiaocan

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.240
The Kong mother and son, dependent on each other for 19 years

00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:08.720
Regarding each other's strengths and weaknesses, one could say

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:09.319
They know them perfectly

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:09.959
Look at you, this... this...

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:10.560
You

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:12.000
Stayed up all night again

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.720
Messing with this junk

00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:16.360
You'll miss the plane, you won't get up

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.480
Are you getting up or not?

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:21.639
How... I'll make it, Mom

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.800
Look at this

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.560
You haven't even packed your luggage

00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:26.160
Is this all the self-care ability you have?

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.319
How will you survive in Belgium?

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:30.000
Honestly

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.560
Making such a mess

00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:32.759
What are you looking for?

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:34.240
I can't find my other shoe

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:35.759
What shoe? Go brush your teeth

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:36.439
Honestly

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.759
I'm only going for a week

00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:38.600
Is this necessary?

00:07:39.399 --> 00:07:40.160
You're going for a week

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:40.879
But you are representing

00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:42.480
The outstanding students of your school

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:45.120
Let me tell you, behave yourself

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:47.720
You have such a good opportunity now

00:07:48.439 --> 00:07:49.519
Such good conditions

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.759
Back in the day

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.040
Mom didn't even have the chance to take the college entrance exam

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.160
Regretted it my whole life

00:07:54.199 --> 00:07:55.199
Don't you dare not cherish this

00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:56.680
Let me tell you, don't be arrogant

00:07:57.319 --> 00:07:58.240
I'll tell you the truth

00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.720
I don't even want to go

00:08:01.959 --> 00:08:02.519
Why?

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.519
Last night my classmate told me

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.160
Aren't these all outstanding representatives from various countries?

00:08:08.439 --> 00:08:09.399
People wear formal attire

00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:12.040
Wearing suits, wearing gowns

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:12.800
Evening gowns

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:13.879
Even haute couture

00:08:14.279 --> 00:08:15.759
Then tell me, if I go there, I'll look...

00:08:16.439 --> 00:08:16.800
Right?

00:08:17.959 --> 00:08:19.079
Those gowns and stuff

00:08:19.079 --> 00:08:20.839
Are the kind you only wear once, right?

00:08:21.879 --> 00:08:22.480
Super expensive

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.879
Not to mention buying, even renting costs a lot

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.480
How much to rent once?

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.199
Renting?

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.279
If you know someone

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:30.800
Probably over two thousand

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:31.959
That expensive?

00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:32.720
Right?

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.240
So I said forget it

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:35.759
But I'm not saying

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.320
I'm not saying I won't go

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.960
Mom, last night I...

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:40.919
I was really worried

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.679
It was just vanity

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.519
Then this morning I heard someone shouting

00:08:45.679 --> 00:08:46.720
"Collecting scrap"

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.279
Suddenly, I grew up

00:08:48.679 --> 00:08:49.759
What are we going there to exchange?

00:08:50.159 --> 00:08:51.360
Cultural exchange

00:08:51.559 --> 00:08:52.200
That spiritual outlook

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.519
I'll just walk my own path

00:08:53.679 --> 00:08:54.399
Let others talk

00:08:54.519 --> 00:08:55.759
I'll just wear my simple clothes

00:08:55.759 --> 00:08:57.039
Let them laugh if they want

00:08:57.559 --> 00:08:58.559
If they ask, I'll communicate

00:08:58.559 --> 00:08:59.879
I'll say I'm enduring great hardships

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.320
How hard it is for my family

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.440
How difficult it is

00:09:02.799 --> 00:09:03.840
We are poor but we have ambition

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.759
Is it easy for a single mom to raise me?

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.039
Why compare those things with them?

00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:08.000
They aren't good people

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.000
Why would you tell people that?

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.320
Being vain is better than that exchange

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.799
You make me spend this useless money

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:15.960
Just for show

00:09:23.759 --> 00:09:25.440
You're the most educated in our family.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.080
You need to look presentable when you go out.

00:09:28.519 --> 00:09:28.960
Take this.

00:09:31.039 --> 00:09:31.799
What is this?

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:33.559
Three thousand.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:38.559
Money.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.159
What are you doing this for?

00:09:44.639 --> 00:09:45.759
What do you mean "what"? Take it.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.559
What did we say?

00:09:46.559 --> 00:09:47.559
We can't encourage people like this.

00:09:47.559 --> 00:09:48.960
It's fine, Mom. What are you doing?

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.360
This isn't a good habit.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:50.759
Take it.

00:09:51.559 --> 00:09:53.000
Be frugal at home, rich on the road. Take it.

00:09:55.799 --> 00:09:56.639
In my mom's eyes,

00:09:56.799 --> 00:09:58.519
my greatest virtue is...

00:09:59.279 --> 00:09:59.879
being filial.

00:10:04.039 --> 00:10:05.559
Kong Guifang, you care too much about face.

00:10:05.919 --> 00:10:06.399
Hypocritical.

00:10:07.159 --> 00:10:08.759
Kong Xiaocan, don't get cheeky with me.

00:10:09.039 --> 00:10:11.120
Alright, alright. Just this once.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:11.960
Mom is the best.

00:10:12.799 --> 00:10:13.240
Love you.

00:10:15.679 --> 00:10:16.200
Mom, have an egg.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:17.960
You eat it, you eat it.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:18.440
You eat first.

00:10:20.279 --> 00:10:20.919
When I get back, I'll bring you

00:10:20.919 --> 00:10:22.200
an Italian scarf.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:22.840
Go on.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.759
Don't waste money.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:25.440
Belgium.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.879
And my mom's greatest virtue is...

00:10:30.519 --> 00:10:31.159
she's easy to coax.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:43.600
Xu Rui.

00:10:45.639 --> 00:10:45.960
No,

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.279
I told you yesterday not to come see me off.

00:10:48.279 --> 00:10:49.440
It's such a hassle coming all this way.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.120
It's the least I could do.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.799
When you get there, you must...

00:11:04.039 --> 00:11:05.679
eat well and sleep well, okay?

00:11:05.679 --> 00:11:06.639
You too, you too.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:07.960
You have to miss me.

00:11:08.039 --> 00:11:09.519
I must have saved the world in my past life...

00:11:09.759 --> 00:11:11.320
to get a girlfriend as good as you.

00:11:12.559 --> 00:11:13.840
Don't you find it blinding, you two?

00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:16.519
Kong Xiaocan.

00:11:16.879 --> 00:11:17.879
I'm such a huge third wheel,

00:11:17.879 --> 00:11:19.159
standing here for so long,

00:11:19.159 --> 00:11:20.480
and you just didn't see me at all?

00:11:20.759 --> 00:11:22.039
You're here too? Where are you going?

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.240
Aren't there two...

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.360
really good brothers...

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.600
who agreed to go to the snow mountain today?

00:11:27.919 --> 00:11:29.480
Where were you? Why are you only here now?

00:11:29.759 --> 00:11:31.279
Wait, why did you bring so much stuff?

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.000
Moving house?

00:11:33.039 --> 00:11:34.759
Buddy, do you think climbing a snow mountain is a joke?

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:35.679
Preparing a bit more stuff...

00:11:35.679 --> 00:11:36.720
is taking responsibility for my life.

00:11:36.919 --> 00:11:37.840
Let me confirm with you one more time.

00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:40.000
Did Godmother really agree to let you go to the snow mountain?

00:11:42.519 --> 00:11:43.200
How did you do it?

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.879
Used some open strategies...

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:47.679
Thick-skinned tactics... wait...

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.120
Just being shameless, right?

00:11:49.759 --> 00:11:50.759
I even got an unexpected bonus.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:56.759
This...

00:11:57.159 --> 00:11:58.600
Is this the travel fund Godmother gave you?

00:11:59.159 --> 00:12:00.440
Is this still the Godmother I know?

00:12:00.519 --> 00:12:01.039
Not for you.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.080
Just a peek is enough.

00:12:02.519 --> 00:12:02.960
Go on.

00:12:03.159 --> 00:12:03.799
Take it and splurge.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.000
Thanks, big brother.

00:12:05.559 --> 00:12:06.080
Xu Rui.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.759
Um, about this competition...

00:12:07.879 --> 00:12:08.960
I can't be with you.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.679
Don't worry, you'll definitely win the championship.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.440
But pay attention to training, don't pull a muscle.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.240
This... this counts as my double.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.559
keeping you company for this period.

00:12:16.799 --> 00:12:18.080
When the time comes, put it at the finish line.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.279
Then you'll definitely win the championship.

00:12:19.279 --> 00:12:20.279
Just run towards me.

00:12:20.799 --> 00:12:21.200
Okay.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.279
I miss you.

00:12:22.519 --> 00:12:23.360
I really miss you.

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.080
I miss you too.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.000
Um...

00:12:27.759 --> 00:12:28.759
Um, excuse me, you two.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:29.879
Interrupting again.

00:12:29.879 --> 00:12:31.159
What are you doing?

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.200
I was watching from over there...

00:12:32.879 --> 00:12:34.799
your heights and looks, you two...

00:12:35.039 --> 00:12:35.919
have zero compatibility.

00:12:36.919 --> 00:12:37.919
Sister Rui, I really want to interview you.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.120
How did you fall for him?

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.480
You could punch him three meters away.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.440
That's just worldly prejudice against us.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.120
Is compatibility something you can see?

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.279
You have to look at the inside.

00:12:45.279 --> 00:12:46.240
Is your Sister Rui that kind of person?

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.639
I'm still the second most handsome guy at Heping No. 2 Primary School.

00:12:47.639 --> 00:12:48.600
How is there no compatibility?

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.960
Look how you're straining her neck.

00:12:51.919 --> 00:12:53.240
Isn't this fine? I can still grow.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.320
Okay, okay, okay.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.200
Fine, fine, Kong Xiaocan.

00:12:55.519 --> 00:12:56.559
I'm going in first. Hurry up.

00:12:56.759 --> 00:12:57.399
Alright, go on.

00:12:57.399 --> 00:12:58.240
I should get going too.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.799
One more thing to tell you.

00:13:01.159 --> 00:13:02.120
Wishing you the championship in advance.

00:13:03.559 --> 00:13:04.840
You stay safe.

00:13:04.879 --> 00:13:05.320
Champion.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:07.679
Let's go, let's go.

00:13:13.519 --> 00:13:15.159
Kids these days...

00:13:15.679 --> 00:13:17.440
They really don't know the value of money.

00:13:17.679 --> 00:13:19.960
A neighbor's kid just started college.

00:13:20.279 --> 00:13:22.240
A phone costing over six thousand.

00:13:22.399 --> 00:13:23.360
Bought it without blinking an eye.

00:13:23.559 --> 00:13:25.440
That's more than an adult's salary.

00:13:25.759 --> 00:13:27.440
Isn't that just the parents spoiling them?

00:13:27.759 --> 00:13:30.000
Kids don't know how hard it is to earn money.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.279
That's why you have to raise kids frugally.

00:13:33.919 --> 00:13:34.840
Student life...

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.200
only lasts a few years.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.080
If they have to scrape by,

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:39.960
when they look back on it later,

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.200
they won't have any good memories.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:43.799
How hard can life really be?

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.480
When they grow up and start working,

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.559
they'll understand on their own.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.759
Even when they're all grown up,

00:13:47.919 --> 00:13:49.120
plenty still rely on their parents.

00:13:50.639 --> 00:13:52.679
Isn't there a popular term for it now?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.080
Mama's boy.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:55.919
Mama's boy.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.080
Mommy's little treasure.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.399
That actually sounds quite nice.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.320
Mama's boy.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.159
Let's see how my Mama's boy is doing.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.440
He hasn't replied yet.

00:14:07.759 --> 00:14:08.799
He must be on the plane.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.000
Xiaocan is so sweet, even taking selfies with you.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.519
I'm telling you, he might not be much else,

00:14:14.879 --> 00:14:15.600
but he sure is filial.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:16.919
You know,

00:14:17.159 --> 00:14:18.480
he's about to go to Belgium.

00:14:18.519 --> 00:14:19.679
Before he's even had any fun himself,

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.039
he asks me what gift I want.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.600
That kid, honestly.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.039
Isn't he just spending your money though?

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.960
Yes, he's spending my money now.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.559
But won't I be spending his money later?

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:32.919
I don't expect much from him.

00:14:33.399 --> 00:14:34.559
Just staying here in our small town,

00:14:34.879 --> 00:14:36.000
being a civil servant,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.559
and having a stable job is enough.

00:14:39.559 --> 00:14:40.480
I wonder...

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.279
what time it is in Belgium right now.

00:14:43.639 --> 00:14:45.279
I want to give him a call.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:46.519
Hurry up.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.639
Ask me why Xiaocan went to Belgium.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.720
I knew you wanted to show off.

00:14:51.039 --> 00:14:51.840
I'm not asking.

00:14:53.279 --> 00:14:54.519
What is Xiaocan doing in Belgium?

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.840
Isn't he studying at Du University?

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.679
International exchange for honor students.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.480
He went to Belgium for an exchange program.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.799
Even if you don't ask, plenty of others will.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.000
Show-off.

00:15:06.799 --> 00:15:07.559
Shameless show-off.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.279
I accidentally said it out loud.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.840
Come on, have a beef pancake.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.559
Eat it while it's hot. It won't be good cold.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.000
Your stomach hurts again?

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:34.399
Where's your medicine?

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.840
Don't move. We'll get it for you.

00:15:36.679 --> 00:15:37.080
Where is it?

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:37.440
It's in...

00:15:44.159 --> 00:15:45.120
With your condition...

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.399
You should be hospitalized immediately.

00:15:47.399 --> 00:15:48.080
To undergo treatment.

00:15:50.039 --> 00:15:50.919
Is that really necessary?

00:15:50.919 --> 00:15:51.200
I...

00:15:51.919 --> 00:15:52.919
Isn't it just stomach trouble?

00:15:52.919 --> 00:15:54.000
I know my own body.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.320
So you know it yourself?

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.080
If you knew,

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.519
why come to the hospital to see a doctor?

00:15:59.399 --> 00:16:01.120
If you knew, it wouldn't have come to this.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:02.759
"I know my own body."

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.519
What stage?

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.200
Right now, you...

00:16:07.279 --> 00:16:07.960
It...

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.519
It's not a stomach problem.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:14.919
It's the pancreas.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.039
Cancer.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:22.759
Pancreas...

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:23.679
Pancreas...

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:24.279
Pan...

00:16:27.399 --> 00:16:28.039
Is anyone there?

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:29.639
There was someone here just now.

00:16:29.879 --> 00:16:31.120
Wait until your number is called!

00:16:31.679 --> 00:16:32.039
No...

00:16:32.519 --> 00:16:33.080
Pancreas...

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.639
It is the pancreas.

00:16:37.679 --> 00:16:38.559
Cancer.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.080
Cancer?

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:41.720
Doctor...

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.080
Cancer...

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:43.799
Just tell me straight.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:46.559
Pancreatic cancer.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.799
It wasn't discovered too late.

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.919
With hospitalization and intervention now,

00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.799
we can still alleviate the pain

00:17:00.039 --> 00:17:02.039
and significantly extend survival time.

00:17:02.639 --> 00:17:04.839
The average is 17 to 20 months.

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:06.400
The longest survivors

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.440
can live for more than five years.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:39.839
Mom.

00:17:39.839 --> 00:17:40.400
Xiaocan.

00:17:41.279 --> 00:17:41.720
Xiaocan.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.119
Mom, Mom, Mom. Can you hear me?

00:17:43.119 --> 00:17:45.359
You arrived? You... You're in Belgium, right?

00:17:45.519 --> 00:17:46.720
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here. Mom.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.359
Mom, it's really great here.

00:17:48.799 --> 00:17:49.799
The teacher is taking good care of me.

00:17:49.799 --> 00:17:50.440
Don't you worry.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.279
Have you eaten?

00:17:51.519 --> 00:17:52.480
I... I ate.

00:17:52.799 --> 00:17:54.480
Um, have you eaten?

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.279
Are you used to living there?

00:17:56.279 --> 00:17:57.640
Totally used to it. Living great. It's all good.

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.599
Mom, I just...

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.400
Hello? The signal isn't very good.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.480
The signal is just bad, Mom.

00:18:01.799 --> 00:18:03.440
Anyway... Hello? Mom, I'm hanging up.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.440
Talk to you later, Mom.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.880
Alright. Bye-bye, Mom.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.319
Okay, okay, okay.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:27.880
Kong Guifang...

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.599
What is truly most important to you?

00:18:31.079 --> 00:18:32.000
Don't you know?

00:18:40.559 --> 00:18:42.079
Here, give me a beef pancake.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.079
Didn't you just go to the hospital?

00:18:44.359 --> 00:18:45.240
Did the doctor say you can eat this?

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:46.680
It's fine.

00:18:46.799 --> 00:18:48.559
The doctor said I just have some bloating.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:50.519
Alright then.

00:18:52.039 --> 00:18:52.599
I scanned it.

00:18:54.759 --> 00:18:55.279
Careful, it's hot.

00:18:55.279 --> 00:18:55.839
Okay, okay.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:18:59.720
Here.

00:19:04.039 --> 00:19:04.960
Why go through the trouble twice?

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:05.880
Business is business.

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.000
I eat, I pay.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.440
This is the sanitation fee for the community.

00:19:11.079 --> 00:19:12.960
You need to pay your stall fee soon.

00:19:13.079 --> 00:19:14.920
Don't let them confiscate your stall later.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:15.920
I remember, I remember.

00:19:16.519 --> 00:19:17.279
Isn't the stall fee...

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.480
expensive?

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.759
How is Xiaocan doing abroad?

00:19:22.599 --> 00:19:23.319
He's doing great.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.200
The kid called me as soon as he got off the plane.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.960
I told him to go get busy with his stuff.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.599
But he just keeps thinking about me.

00:19:30.079 --> 00:19:31.599
He even said he wants to buy me gifts every day.

00:19:31.599 --> 00:19:32.359
Asking me what I want.

00:19:32.359 --> 00:19:32.799
I mean...

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.880
I don't lack anything. Why would I need gifts?

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.000
Son

00:20:01.119 --> 00:20:01.480
Mom

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.319
I miss you

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.960
How are you doing over there? Is it good?

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.000
Pretty good, pretty good

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:08.680
It's fine

00:20:09.079 --> 00:20:10.119
Have a little porridge

00:20:10.279 --> 00:20:10.839
Eat a little bit

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:11.279
Okay

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.559
Aunt Zhang

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.119
Your Aunt Zhang

00:20:13.119 --> 00:20:13.559
Aunt Zhang

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.039
Xiaocan

00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:16.920
He's in Belgium

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:17.519
Quick

00:20:17.759 --> 00:20:19.799
Let Aunt Zhang and me see what Belgium looks like

00:20:21.559 --> 00:20:22.720
It looks about the same as here

00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:23.880
Mom, I... I'm busy right now

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.079
I stepped out to take the call

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.359
Okay, okay. Send me some nice photos later

00:20:27.799 --> 00:20:28.519
Sure. You guys talk

00:20:28.559 --> 00:20:29.240
Okay, okay

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.079
You need to watch your health

00:20:31.079 --> 00:20:31.759
Don't get heatstroke

00:20:31.759 --> 00:20:32.880
It's pretty hot over there too

00:20:33.359 --> 00:20:34.920
Look, I'm hot here too. I'm wearing short sleeves

00:20:35.359 --> 00:20:36.079
It's hot as hell here

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:36.839
Come, come. Right?

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.000
Let's take a group photo

00:20:38.599 --> 00:20:39.039
Come, come over here

00:20:39.599 --> 00:20:40.680
Come on, let's all take a picture

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.559
Come on, everyone look here

00:20:43.359 --> 00:20:43.759
Xiaocan

00:20:44.279 --> 00:20:46.319
Why are there so many Chinese people there?

00:20:46.559 --> 00:20:47.640
Where exactly are you?

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.039
Chi... Chinatown. Chinatown

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:50.119
Chinatown

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:54.279
Our motherland is so beautiful! Snow Mountain, here we come!

00:20:57.319 --> 00:20:58.440
Xiaocan, where on earth are you?

00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.640
What "motherland"? That...

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.039
Isn't it summer over there?

00:21:01.039 --> 00:21:01.880
Why is there a snow mountain?

00:21:02.759 --> 00:21:03.640
Alright, my signal is bad

00:21:03.799 --> 00:21:04.599
Hanging up, hanging up, hanging up

00:21:05.759 --> 00:21:06.119
Wh...

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:08.079
No...

00:21:17.279 --> 00:21:19.160
Hello, is this Teacher Zhang?

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.240
I'm Kong Xiaocan's mother

00:21:21.519 --> 00:21:21.880
I...

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Kong Xiaocan's mother?

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.119
Kong Xiaocan hasn't attended class since school started

00:21:25.559 --> 00:21:26.240
He didn't ask for leave either

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:27.839
His situation is very serious

00:21:27.839 --> 00:21:28.799
This is truancy

00:21:30.079 --> 00:21:30.599
What?

00:21:32.279 --> 00:21:32.960
Truancy

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:40.759
Guifang

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:41.680
Guifang

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.359
You can't do this front step like this

00:22:13.839 --> 00:22:14.279
The back...

00:22:14.599 --> 00:22:15.279
The back is correct

00:22:15.839 --> 00:22:16.599
Guifang, in the front you should...

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:17.839
Something happened at your home

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:20.559
Teacher

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:21.839
I dropped out

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.680
I can't take the college entrance exam

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.160
Your grades are so good

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.720
It's a pity not to take the exam

00:22:27.079 --> 00:22:27.759
It's okay. I believe...

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.599
...there will be opportunities in the future

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:43.680
Guifang

00:22:44.079 --> 00:22:44.480
Let me do it

00:22:44.839 --> 00:22:45.680
Thanks, Haiming

00:22:48.039 --> 00:22:48.400
Guifang

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.119
Let's get married

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:05.720
Be a good boy, Xiaocan

00:23:07.359 --> 00:23:08.440
Good boy, good boy

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.160
Xiaocan, let's learn something

00:23:10.359 --> 00:23:12.440
Just like the people on TV

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.200
Mom

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.839
Wait a moment, Mom is coming

00:23:18.359 --> 00:23:18.960
Okay, okay, okay

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.880
Mom, I want to eat ribs

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.119
Mom, where's my thing?

00:23:25.599 --> 00:23:26.960
Mom, where's that thing of mine?

00:23:27.759 --> 00:23:29.960
Mom

00:23:31.519 --> 00:23:32.839
Exams are coming up soon

00:23:32.839 --> 00:23:34.160
And you're still just playing here

00:23:34.319 --> 00:23:35.200
You are so rude

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.240
You vicious mother

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.920
I haven't grown at all, I'm too short

00:23:38.039 --> 00:23:39.440
Look at Zhang Chi, that big goofy guy

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.079
He's so happy

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:42.279
Mom, you're the best

00:23:42.319 --> 00:23:42.720
Love you

00:23:43.319 --> 00:23:43.960
When I come back, I'll give you...

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.240
I'll bring that Italian silk scarf

00:23:47.319 --> 00:23:48.319
Alright, my signal is bad

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.279
Hanging up, hanging up, hanging up

00:23:56.319 --> 00:23:57.559
Isn't this my movie?

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.799
Why is the plot all about this unfilial son?

00:24:02.599 --> 00:24:03.160
Kong Guifang

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.000
In this life

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.559
Have you ever put yourself first?

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.079
Hello, where is the observation room?

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:32.920
Over there

00:24:33.039 --> 00:24:33.400
Thank you

00:24:39.799 --> 00:24:40.759
Hello, may I ask where the observation room is?

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:41.480
Over there

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:41.880
Thanks

00:24:46.839 --> 00:24:47.960
It was discovered late to begin with

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.160
And she refused to be hospitalized

00:24:51.039 --> 00:24:52.839
Whenever we mention it, she says she knows

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
She insists on conservative treatment

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.599
Do you know the consequences of conservative treatment?

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:57.640
I know

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.200
Right, you "know" again

00:24:59.559 --> 00:25:01.680
If you really knew, you wouldn't think like this

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.200
As a doctor, I firmly disagree

00:25:03.279 --> 00:25:04.160
You need to hurry

00:25:04.519 --> 00:25:05.440
And get the hospitalization done

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.599
Just... just prescribe me the medicine

00:25:08.279 --> 00:25:10.000
I'll take responsibility for my decision

00:25:11.599 --> 00:25:12.559
This is just my fate

00:25:14.799 --> 00:25:16.480
But pancreatic cancer cannot be delayed

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:18.640
If you ask me

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.839
Just spend more time with your Mom

00:25:20.839 --> 00:25:22.119
She doesn't have many days left

00:25:24.559 --> 00:25:25.160
Xiaocan

00:25:26.279 --> 00:25:28.359
Here are your Mom's medical records and bills

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.039
Take good care of your Mom

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:34.279
I'm leaving

00:25:35.039 --> 00:25:35.519
Take care

00:25:42.519 --> 00:25:43.160
Xiaocan

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.680
Your Mom always tells me

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:48.720
When educating a child

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.599
Don't let the child have psychological burdens

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.000
Don't give the child too much pressure

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.000
She can be frugal herself

00:25:56.079 --> 00:25:57.920
But she can't save on the child's money

00:25:58.759 --> 00:26:00.039
He doesn't need to be too sensible

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.519
He'll understand naturally when he grows up

00:26:03.799 --> 00:26:06.640
Your Mom is full of pride when she talks about you

00:26:07.279 --> 00:26:08.240
But you...

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.960
You are too insensible

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.599
Spend some good time with your Mom

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.519
The ledger... where is the bank card?

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:51.880
Hello

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.000
Hello, payment

00:26:57.079 --> 00:26:57.519
The bill

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:03.319
Kong Guifang

00:27:04.559 --> 00:27:05.400
Please enter password

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:08.400
Password

00:27:09.319 --> 00:27:10.079
Just enter it

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:13.960
Password

00:27:15.799 --> 00:27:16.440
My birthday

00:27:33.079 --> 00:27:34.039
It really is my birthday

00:27:36.519 --> 00:27:37.279
Here

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:39.839
Take it

00:28:19.839 --> 00:28:22.759
Total expenses for this month

00:28:23.319 --> 00:28:25.279
11,320 yuan

00:28:25.839 --> 00:28:28.000
Why are phones so expensive nowadays?

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.000
Mom, can't I just play for a while?

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:42.359
Mom! Why... just playing on the phone...

00:28:44.759 --> 00:28:46.200
Mom, you're really a good mom

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:48.319
You're so good, Mom

00:28:49.759 --> 00:28:50.440
So good

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:51.839
Illuminates your beauty

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:57.839
Total expenses for this month: 5,566

00:28:58.759 --> 00:29:00.960
Xiaocan really wears out shoes fast

00:29:03.839 --> 00:29:06.000
This coat of mine looks like it can last another two years

00:29:08.759 --> 00:29:11.480
Xiaocan has been asking for money in different ways lately

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:12.839
Could he be dating?

00:29:19.359 --> 00:29:20.920
Dating does cost money

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.160
I'll just tighten my belt a bit

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.160
Remaining savings: 160,000.

00:29:37.119 --> 00:29:39.920
Xiaocan's tuition and living expenses for four years of college.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.559
Roughly 166,000.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:44.200
Even if I'm gone,

00:29:44.599 --> 00:29:46.319
until he enters the workforce,

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:47.519
it should be enough.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:48.920
Just prescribe the medicine for me.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:50.400
This is just my fate.

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:55.680
Is the money enough?

00:29:55.759 --> 00:29:56.799
If not, Mom will transfer you some more.

00:29:59.799 --> 00:30:01.599
You have the highest education in our family.

00:30:01.759 --> 00:30:03.200
You need to look presentable when you go out.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.359
If you ask me,

00:30:05.599 --> 00:30:06.640
you should spend more time with your mom.

00:30:07.599 --> 00:30:08.799
She doesn't have much time left.

00:30:10.359 --> 00:30:10.720
Xiaocan.

00:30:11.319 --> 00:30:11.920
Godmother's illness...

00:30:14.039 --> 00:30:14.440
Hello?

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:16.480
Can you hear me?

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:17.640
Hello?

00:30:18.559 --> 00:30:19.039
Xiaocan.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.079
Are you okay?

00:30:20.839 --> 00:30:22.160
Li Wai said something happened to your family.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:23.480
Is Auntie okay?

00:30:24.559 --> 00:30:25.160
Xu Rui.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.119
Let's break up.

00:30:30.759 --> 00:30:31.319
Xiaocan.

00:30:32.119 --> 00:30:33.079
What happened to you?

00:30:33.519 --> 00:30:34.720
Don't be like this. Tell me.

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:35.440
It's nothing.

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.440
I don't think I'm good enough for you.

00:30:43.839 --> 00:30:45.000
Let's go back to being friends.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.160
Kong Xiaocan, you jerk.

00:30:47.759 --> 00:30:48.720
Who wants to be friends with you?

00:31:04.079 --> 00:31:04.480
Mom.

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.119
I'm sorry.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:14.279
Could you...

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:23.720
Please get better.

00:31:24.759 --> 00:31:25.440
I beg you.

00:31:25.759 --> 00:31:26.880
Please get better.

00:31:29.519 --> 00:31:30.440
If you can get well,

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.359
your son will do anything.

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:41.480
You said it.

00:31:44.319 --> 00:31:44.799
Who are you?

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:46.640
You can call me A Fu.

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:48.720
I heard everything you just said.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.640
I'm here today to give you, this unfilial son,

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.079
a chance.

00:31:54.799 --> 00:31:55.440
Do I know you?

00:31:56.119 --> 00:31:56.839
You don't know me.

00:31:57.119 --> 00:31:58.400
But I know you.

00:31:58.599 --> 00:32:00.200
Kong Xiaocan.

00:32:00.759 --> 00:32:03.359
Mischievous since childhood, disobedient.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:05.079
And you often lie to your mom.

00:32:05.279 --> 00:32:06.279
Just recently,

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.720
under the guise of a study abroad exchange,

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.759
you scammed a huge sum to tour the snow mountains.

00:32:12.119 --> 00:32:14.359
As a child, you stole the family's pigeon eggs.

00:32:14.599 --> 00:32:16.039
And stole the neighbor's dog.

00:32:18.279 --> 00:32:18.960
O-Okay, enough.

00:32:21.359 --> 00:32:21.920
Who are you?

00:32:22.119 --> 00:32:22.839
You investigated me?

00:32:23.519 --> 00:32:25.680
But everything I said is correct.

00:32:25.759 --> 00:32:26.279
And,

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.160
I can save your mom.

00:32:31.359 --> 00:32:31.880
How?

00:32:32.119 --> 00:32:33.680
Exchange Life Energy.

00:32:34.039 --> 00:32:34.759
Turn despair

00:32:35.519 --> 00:32:37.599
into hope.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.559
Our prices are honest and fair.

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:41.960
From ringed Saturn

00:32:42.039 --> 00:32:43.960
to the distant Centaurus galaxy.

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:44.960
672...

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:45.920
For 672 years,

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.759
there hasn't been a single bad review in the Milky Way.

00:32:48.079 --> 00:32:49.920
As long as you are willing to trade 25 years

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:51.039
of Life Energy to your mom...

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.319
You're sick.

00:32:54.119 --> 00:32:57.039
...she can recover completely.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:32:59.799
Just like this.

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.119
That's right.

00:33:27.359 --> 00:33:28.960
I am what you humans call

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.680
a genuine alien being.

00:33:35.359 --> 00:33:36.279
Kong Xiaocan.

00:33:36.519 --> 00:33:39.079
Are you willing to talk now?

00:33:57.279 --> 00:33:57.720
Dear

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.240
You've been touching me for twenty minutes.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.240
I am real.

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.279
What I just said is also true.

00:34:03.519 --> 00:34:05.440
Using 25 years of Life Energy

00:34:05.799 --> 00:34:06.920
in exchange for your mother's health.

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:08.239
Is it not worth it?

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:09.400
It is worth it.

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:11.679
Then why not make the exchange?

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.320
I'm waiting for you.

00:34:15.599 --> 00:34:16.519
I'm waiting for you.

00:34:16.719 --> 00:34:17.519
I'm waiting for you.

00:34:17.519 --> 00:34:18.440
Then let's do it.

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:18.800
Come on.

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:19.239
Come on.

00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:19.960
Then let's start.

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:21.079
What's the process?

00:34:21.079 --> 00:34:22.599
TV never showed anything like you.

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:24.280
Here, just sign the contract and fingerprint it.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.599
You guys are so old-school.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.039
Mr. Kong, please look.

00:34:29.519 --> 00:34:30.800
This is your transaction contract.

00:34:31.519 --> 00:34:33.159
This is the basic status of your Life Energy.

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.199
This is a special notice.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.880
Violations and your penalties.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:37.239
This is the glossary of terms.

00:34:37.559 --> 00:34:38.440
This is the party's contract.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:39.679
This is your collateral status.

00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:40.960
And the Life Energy equity commitment.

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.000
Come, thumb.

00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:44.639
Big finger.

00:34:44.679 --> 00:34:45.159
Hurry up, hurry up.

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:46.000
It... it's so traditional.

00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:47.719
Come, come, come.

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:56.079
Finally made a sale.

00:34:57.679 --> 00:34:58.199
Mr. Kong.

00:34:58.679 --> 00:35:00.280
Our transaction is complete.

00:35:00.559 --> 00:35:01.079
It's done?

00:35:05.079 --> 00:35:05.519
You just...

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:08.880
Do I need to...

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:26.639
Congratulations.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:30.119
Ms. Kong Guifang's wonderful son, Mr. Kong Xiaocan.

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:33.239
You've become our first customer in the solar system.

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:36.360
And congratulations to Ms. Kong on her rebirth.

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.239
That concludes today's service.

00:35:43.719 --> 00:35:45.320
Remember to give a five-star rating. I'm off!

00:35:48.679 --> 00:35:49.599
Just... done?

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:58.199
Mom.

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:00.760
Mom.

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:29.519
I was scammed.

00:37:02.519 --> 00:37:02.840
Mom.

00:37:05.199 --> 00:37:05.519
Mom.

00:37:20.159 --> 00:37:20.480
Mom.

00:37:23.039 --> 00:37:25.199
Kong Xiaocan, you little brat!

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:26.719
Mom, Mom, Mom!

00:37:26.719 --> 00:37:27.800
Kong Xiaocan, you little brat!

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:28.679
Daring to lie to me and skip school!

00:37:29.079 --> 00:37:29.679
You stand right there!

00:37:34.679 --> 00:37:35.280
Missed me.

00:37:49.199 --> 00:37:49.719
Son!

00:37:50.239 --> 00:37:51.440
Let Mom see where you got hurt.

00:37:51.519 --> 00:37:53.199
Mom, you hit too hard.

00:37:53.199 --> 00:37:54.239
Didn't you fall on your own?

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.320
Easy, easy. Can you get up?

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.360
It hurts.

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.159
Then let's go to the hospital. We're going to the hospital.

00:37:58.159 --> 00:37:59.239
Aren't we already in the hospital?

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:00.559
Where else does it hurt?

00:38:00.559 --> 00:38:01.480
Everywhere.

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:02.400
How about your head?

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.719
No good. I need a CT scan, Mom.

00:38:03.719 --> 00:38:04.440
A CT scan?

00:38:04.639 --> 00:38:06.119
Put this on. Your feet are freezing.

00:38:08.599 --> 00:38:09.679
You're acting with me, aren't you?

00:38:09.679 --> 00:38:10.599
You've got some nerve now, huh? No, no.

00:38:10.599 --> 00:38:11.159
Skipping school on me.

00:38:11.159 --> 00:38:11.599
Stop moving around.

00:38:11.599 --> 00:38:12.480
Skipping school. Look, look who this is.

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:12.960
Damn kid.

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:13.920
Look, you little brat.

00:38:21.239 --> 00:38:22.239
Why are you showing me a snow mountain?

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:23.159
Want me to slap you?

00:38:23.559 --> 00:38:23.960
No, no.

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:24.360
I'm telling you,

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:25.119
seeing snow mountains makes me angry now.

00:38:25.119 --> 00:38:25.960
Mom, don't be impulsive. Calm down.

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:26.960
What are you doing, Kong Xiaocan?

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.119
Look, look. You've got nerve. Look at this.
