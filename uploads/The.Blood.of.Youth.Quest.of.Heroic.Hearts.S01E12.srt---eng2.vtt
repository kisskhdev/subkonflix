I see the horrible scenes

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:47.510
when my whole family was murdered.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.910
I cannot erase the past.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.790
But I want to know why.

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:56.510
Since you have made up your mind

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:58.030
and chosen your path,

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.910
just pursue what your heart wants.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.240
If I may ask for your honesty,

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:05.480
where exactly

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.320
is Xiao Se,

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.000
the owner of Skysplitter?

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.440
I do not know.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.750
But the Skysplitter and its owner

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:14.480
can sense each other.

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:16.000
It will

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:17.790
bring you to its owner.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:20.510
Thank you for the guidance, Sir.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:25.270
As you travel with the Skysplitter,

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:27.480
the entire world will be against you.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.080
It will be dangerous.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.510
I have three gifts for you.

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.720
May you

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.790
find the owner of the Skysplitter successfully.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.000
Weigui.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.200
You're searching for your past.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:53.270
Remember, obsession

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:54.150
may lead to deviation.

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:56.670
I gave you this chant.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:58.670
It may improve your progress

00:11:58.910 --> 00:11:59.600
and

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.080
calm you down.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:15.000
Little one.

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:16.600
Although you were disrespectful,

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.200
you proved that you are still kind.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.000
I gave you this sword technique

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.360
to protect Weigui

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.480
and Hua Xiaohua on this journey.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:25.360
Thank you, Sir.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:27.390
Sir, may I ask you

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.320
