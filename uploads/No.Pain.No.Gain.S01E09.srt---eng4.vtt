=Episode 9=
(This story is purely fictional)

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.510
Hello?

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.990
Dad, Mom.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.140
Son, where are you?

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.280
Your new house?

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.510
How's the renovation going?

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.510
Show us.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.860
I'm in the new house.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:27.990
Let me show you.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.740
Look.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.700
I'm getting ready

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.830
to renovate the house.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:34.700
See, I told you.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.670
It's a huge project.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.020
It's going to take some time.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.420
You know,

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.670
Uncle Ge and Aunt Zhang

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.350
came to annoy your dad today.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.180
They said, "Your son
has bought a new house,

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.070
so why isn't he letting you move in?"

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.350
Your dad got so angry,
and his blood pressure shot high.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.270
Don't listen to your mother.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.390
I won't stoop to the same level as Ge.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.300
I'm telling you,
I'm still exercising every day,

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.613
climbing up and down the stairs.

00:02:58.635 --> 00:02:59.510
Later, I'm going

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.580
to take the trash out.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.110
Look how healthy I am.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.670
Right?

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.510
Dad, Mom, don't worry.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.350
I will

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.740
get it done quickly

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.300
so you can move in soon.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.860
Okay?

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:12.420
Son.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.390
Don't worry about the house.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.790
Don't worry about us.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.270
Take care of yourself.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.391
Don't over-exert yourself.

00:03:18.391 --> 00:03:18.990
Yes.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:21.790
Dad, Mom, I have work to do.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:22.510
Bye.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.900
Okay.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:23.350
Sure.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.740
Bye.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.390
What did you tell him?

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.350
Why make him worry?

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.790
I need to branch out

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.070
to make more losses.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.860
Go!

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:15.670
Save me!

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:16.620
Defend Mr. Ma!

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.300
Save me!

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.180
I'm on a 12-kill streak!
I'm trying my best!

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.550
Go!

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.470
Sorry.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:27.500
I'm a noob, sorry.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.180
Start again.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.940
It's okay.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.420
Will you win for sure?

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:31.860
Dude, wait.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:32.860
You're up next.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:34.350
It's okay.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.110
That's not a dude.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:37.820
It's Mr. Pei.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.620
- Hello, Mr. Pei!
- Hi, Mr. Pei!

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:43.620
Hello, everyone.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.620
Come on.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.813
You're not playing anymore
because the boss is here?

00:04:46.813 --> 00:04:48.880
You cowards want to get involved
in venture capital?

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.590
Relax.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.670
Mr. Pei is not the kind
of ordinary boss.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:52.620
Sit down.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.350
- Sit down.
- Just sit.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:55.860
Introductions are in order.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.420
These people are new recruits

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.710
for DreamForge Capital.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.168
They're from the same college as ours.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:01.740
Huang Wang,

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.620
1,830 points on the Summit Ranking.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.060
Jiang Huan,

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.820
1,780 points on the Summit Ranking.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:07.420
Amazing, right?

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.613
No need to introduce the rest.

00:05:08.657 --> 00:05:09.550
I've read your resumes.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:10.670
All of you couldn't receive

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:11.380
any offers, right?

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.910
The counselor told me

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.590
to help these juniors

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.470
fulfill their dreams.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:17.470
So, I decided

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:18.420
to let them join.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.180
Ma Yang.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.030
You're getting into the groove,

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.380
but you're neglecting

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.620
a crucial problem.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.060
Everyone woke up early

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.820
to play games with Mr. Ma.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.391
This can cause work-related injuries.

00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:29.180
Everyone.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.940
After work, you can claim five skins

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.550
as your reward.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:36.180
Great!

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.180
Five skins?

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.420
Tang Yishu?

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:46.550
Tang?

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.030
Mr. Pei.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.820
You...

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.940
What happened to you?

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.740
Nothing.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.060
I slipped and fell.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.670
(Tang Yishu,)

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:00.990
(my college junior.)

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.910
(Goddess of Bad Luck)
(On the day she graduated,)

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.120
(Expert in Silence)
(she lost her graduation degree.)

00:06:03.124 --> 00:06:05.030
(On the day of her exam,
she lost her exam slip.)

00:06:05.035 --> 00:06:07.320
(Three years since she graduated,
she's never found a job.)

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.670
Take care.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.740
Ma Yang.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:16.180
Ma Yang.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.990
I'm telling you.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:18.670
You did a great job

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.180
recruiting Tang.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.300
She's going to be

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.300
our guardian spirit in DreamForge.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.110
Okay.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.860
Get her to do a full body checkup.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:26.670
Sure.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:28.180
Qian.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.550
Well, the counselor said we don't need
to hire all of them.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:32.670
Do you think

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.790
there are too many people here?

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.550
You couldn't find
a job back then, either.

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:37.820
Did that stop you from becoming

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.470
my most trusted partner?

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:42.990
They're all talented.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.420
Okay.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:43.990
Nurture them.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.550
Sure.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.990
Friends!

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.230
One more round!

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:50.300
Nice!

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.740
- One more round!
- Come on!

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:57.500
Hi, Mr. Pei.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.420
This is Bao Xu.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.620
I'm in Italy.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:00.380
Take a look.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.500
Mr. Pei, this is Bao Xu.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.030
I'm in Spain.

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:09.470
Take a look.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.110
Mr. Pei, this is Bao Xu.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.380
I'm in France.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:14.550
Please confirm.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.420
Mr. Pei, this is Bao Xu.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.990
I'm in the US.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.860
He's snatching my phone!

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.420
Bao Xu, are you okay?

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.940
(Typing...)

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:34.420
Bao Xu.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.740
I won't forget your sacrifice.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:38.910
Mr. Pei.

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:39.740
You're finally free.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:40.180
No...

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.180
I just need five minutes.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.420
Five minutes.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.480
According to your demands,

00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:44.670
you want a soulslike game

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:46.710
that combines core mechanics
with ancient poetry.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:47.590
I thought about it.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:49.380
When the gamers fight,

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.110
during the anticipation period,

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.620
they can attack by shouting
matching poetry lines.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:56.550
Take a look.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.230
You...

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:07.230
managed

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:08.380
to think of this?

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.180
Does this meet your expectations?

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:15.420
Yes.

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.300
Why not?

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.150
It's all thanks to you

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.300
for making me compile
a list of failed games

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.550
in the past.

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:24.590
I did some research and got inspired.

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:27.910
It seems that adding
elements of ancient poetry

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:28.940
is feasible.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:35.500
Mr. Pei.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:36.780
What's wrong?

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:39.070
My leg hurts.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:41.780
Your leg hurts?

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:45.950
Lin Wan.

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.660
In a soulslike game,

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.430
we should set the difficulty

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.230
to Hell Mode.

00:08:52.435 --> 00:08:53.470
Make games like Elden Ring

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:54.070
feel irrelevant

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.380
in front of this game.

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.140
We need to

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:57.710
make it the best game ever.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:59.230
Of course.

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:00.380
Please tell me more

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.140
about the difficulty level.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.070
So, how many players do you think

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:06.146
should be eliminated
in early-game boss battles?

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:08.950
Let's set it to...

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:10.990
99...

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:12.900
99.99%.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.260
99.9999%.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:17.540
Yeah.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.590
99.9999%

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:20.190
of our players

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:21.780
won't be hindered

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:22.950
by the difficulty level.

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:24.380
We need to believe in our players.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.710
They are capable
of overcoming these hurdles.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.620
Set the difficulty as great as you can.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.950
I'll work on the specifics myself.

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:34.430
Are you serious?

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:35.590
Of course.

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:38.230
We can even add

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.830
a mocking system.

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:42.310
A mocking system?

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:42.830
Yes.

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:44.190
This will be an exclusive

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:45.660
interaction between us

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:46.990
and the players.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.020
You see.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.660
When it's game over for the players,

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:50.830
our system

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:52.660
will mock them

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:53.830
ruthlessly

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.860
to improve the immersive experience.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.540
This will be a paid game,

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.260
but let's set the refund period

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.350
as long as possible.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.190
Also, set a reminder

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:06.070
so that the players

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:06.830
can refund on time.

00:10:09.457 --> 00:10:10.457
Will this really work?

00:10:10.546 --> 00:10:11.310
Of course.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.260
This game

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.590
shall be called

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.620
Returning to Shore.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:39.470
Not a single reader.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:43.230
Not a single reader at all.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.020
Huang, don't worry.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.110
Our web fiction company has just begun.

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:48.620
It's always tough at the start.

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:52.660
We're not getting any views at all.

00:10:52.724 --> 00:10:54.230
I'm carrying a heavy responsibility.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.260
I feel like I'm letting Mr. Pei down.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:57.230
I don't even deserve

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:58.990
a nice office like this.

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:00.710
Huang.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.110
A veteran writer

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:04.710
named Russell once said,

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:07.110
if you think your work is important,

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:09.470
it's a sign that you're going mad.

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:11.230
You need to enjoy.

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:12.470
Look.

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:14.110
This office that Mr. Pei rented for you

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:15.860
fits your style.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.950
Huang.

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:19.110
Don't be anxious.

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:21.110
Mr. Pei's wacky ideas

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:24.230
may deter readers at first.

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:27.070
I've given much thought about it.

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:29.070
Our unconventional ideas

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.710
may not be able to satisfy

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.470
Mr. Pei's demands for innovation.

00:11:32.524 --> 00:11:34.470
We need to make it
more unconventional than ever.

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:36.230
So, I wrote something like that.

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:39.380
I wanted to see
whether this trailblazing writing style

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:40.470
would ever work.

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:41.350
In the end...

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:43.230
Not a single reader.

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:44.990
Huang, you're writing web fiction too?

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:46.470
Show me.

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:47.860
Well...

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:49.230
It's embarrassing.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.380
A litterateur in the making, Huang?

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:55.350
Huang.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.110
That's an interesting pseudonym.

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:01.500
(A Survey Report on Wage Slaves)
Ma Dubiao?

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:03.950
You can read that? Impressive.

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:06.190
What a weird name.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.590
It's a username I created

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:09.260
in my last job.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:10.590
It's close to my heart.

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:12.380
Someone's reading it after all.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:13.950
You have a message from him.

00:12:15.702 --> 00:12:17.900
(You have a message from Niu Yanben)
How do you read that?

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:19.590
Niu Yanben.

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:21.350
You know a lot of words.

00:12:24.013 --> 00:12:25.230
Huang, why do you look like

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:27.350
you've found your soulmate?

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:28.540
Let's see what he wrote.

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:33.350
Hello, Mr. Ma Dubiao.

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:34.830
I am a novelist

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:36.310
and ghostwriter.

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:37.235
I'm not earning much.

00:12:37.235 --> 00:12:38.500
I'm about to lose faith,

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.110
but after reading your work,

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:41.380
I felt the same way

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:42.500
and got motivated.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:43.950
Even though no one's

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:45.310
reading your work, just like mine,

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:46.350
please don't give up.

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:47.660
Let's continue writing

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:50.070
and have faith in our talents.

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:53.020
It's so hard to be a writer.

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:54.540
I guess that's why

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.070
Mr. Pei wanted to create

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:57.430
Zhongdian Web Fiction,

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:58.620
so that he could protect

00:12:58.620 --> 00:12:59.830
these grassroots writers.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.110
What a visionary.

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:10.950
Send me your account details.

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:12.280
I'll transfer some money to you...

00:13:12.302 --> 00:13:13.020
Huang.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.950
Instead of giving him a fish,
why not teach him how to fish?

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:18.430
Let him join Zhongdian Web Fiction.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:21.830
That makes sense.

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:25.540
Huang.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:27.900
I have an idea

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.190
about our web fiction company.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:40.860
(Shenhua International)

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:47.180
(DreamForge Capital)

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:47.860
Qian.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.860
These projects aren't working out,
are they?

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:52.110
Ma Yang.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:53.900
I've always known

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.310
that the investment market
is full of odds,

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:58.380
but I didn't expect

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:01.020
it also has so many...

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.020
Talents.

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:05.900
Regarding investment,

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.430
you should talk to Ms. Xin.

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:10.070
She has a keen eye in investment.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:11.500
If she sees these projects,

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:12.470
she'd say,

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:15.260
"These projects are too early-stage."

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:16.230
Early-stage?

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:17.990
"Do you have something

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:19.950
that's more complete,

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:21.470
that can be implemented right away?"

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:24.380
Right away?

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:28.110
There is.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:32.860
As society develops,

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:34.620
public telephone booths

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.740
have been disused,

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:37.540
abandoned

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:38.830
and even destroyed.

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:41.740
This is a huge crack
in cultural continuity,

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.660
causing precious memories to fade,

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:46.230
and a painful phenomenon
amid development.

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.780
I shall

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:49.830
combine vending machines

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.710
and phone booths

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:52.500
to create

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:54.990
a vending machine

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.260
designed like a phone booth.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:58.260
With art,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.990
we shall reshape everyone's aesthetics.

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:01.310
With nostalgia,

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:02.710
we shall recall everyone's memories.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:03.620
With convenience,

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:05.990
we shall change everyone's lives.

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:07.860
Parallel sentences.

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:08.710
He must have

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:10.830
at least graduated from middle school.

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:12.620
From what I heard,

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.260
it's just a vending machine, right?

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:15.380
I'm telling you.

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.950
This may be a small project,

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.950
but it sounds good.

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:20.950
It's good?

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:22.380
Let's think about it first.

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:23.950
Ma Yang.

00:15:24.013 --> 00:15:25.860
If it's something
everyone looks out for,

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:26.950
that's crowdfunding.

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:28.140
Taking risks

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:29.710
is the future.

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:32.860
How much

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:34.070
do you want us to invest?

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:34.830
200,000 yuan.

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:36.310
200...

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:37.950
2.4 meters high.

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:39.260
Made of steel.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:40.350
Lacquered with spray paint.

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:41.660
Exquisite retro handles.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:42.990
Wooden flooring.

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:44.620
It'd cost around 100,000 yuan to build.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:45.540
Other than that,

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:47.260
we'd also need money

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.110
for the booth interior.

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:51.070
So, 200,000 yuan.

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:53.190
Well, go back and think

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:53.950
about what else

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:55.430
you can add inside the booth.

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:57.900
We'll start mass production
as soon as possible.

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.110
We'll flood the streets of Jinchuan
with your booths.

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:03.710
Okay.

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:05.070
I'll do my best.

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:06.860
I won't let you down, Mr. Fei...

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:08.430
It's Mr. Pei.

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:10.540
I won't let you down, Mr. Pei.

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:11.380
Now,

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:11.900
let us sign

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.830
a strategic cooperation agreement.

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:15.500
If you have any good projects

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.310
and ideas in mind,

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:17.590
you must present them

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:18.540
to DreamForge Capital.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.060
(Project: Genius Inventor
Reason for Pass: Loss Guaranteed)

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:28.300
(Tengda Games)

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.020
Other than the phone booth project,

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:34.620
Xin Hailu rejected every other one.

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:36.990
As long as Zhang Wang is around,
loss is guaranteed.

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:38.710
Then there's Ma Yang.

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:39.740
With two of them around,

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.310
disaster is imminent.

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:43.660
Speaking of Ma Yang,

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:46.191
if anyone else loses money,
you might see it as a betrayal.

00:16:46.191 --> 00:16:47.310
But if it's Ma Yang,

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:49.540
you'd think it's an honest mistake.

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.310
Only Ma Yang can attract

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:53.540
people like Zhang Wang.

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:56.430
Our phone booth project
is guaranteed to lose money.

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:01.780
DreamForge Capital
has infinite potential.

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:04.430
M&Y is still ruthlessly profiting,

00:17:04.524 --> 00:17:06.820
but the private restaurant
is consistently losing money,

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.340
while Returning to Shore is on hiatus.

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.470
Zhongdian Web Fiction is bound to fail.

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:14.060
In conclusion, our prospects

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.780
are bright and optimistic.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:19.820
Look.

00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:20.430
What's wrong...

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:21.630
What's wrong with Mr. Pei?

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:36.660
(How to lose money: Staff management,
Venture Capital, Games, Zhongdian Web Fiction)

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:38.870
(When you teach
at Washington University,)

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.540
(you can enjoy the view of Mt. Rainier.)

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:42.910
(Therefore,)

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:44.260
(many professors)

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.430
(are willing to give up
better opportunities)

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:47.950
(just to work here.)

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:50.430
(This is the Rainier effect.)

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:52.020
(It means)

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:54.300
(a company can create)

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.820
(a conducive work environment)

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.950
(to satisfy its employees'
emotional needs)

00:17:57.950 --> 00:17:59.340
(in order to retain talent.)

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.670
Mr. Pei, you wanted to see me?

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:02.500
What is it?

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.260
You're the one who said
you had something to discuss.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:10.740
I remember now.

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.630
Lately, I found out that an employee

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:13.835
is secretly working overtime.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:14.740
What does this mean?

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.870
It means they're stressed out.

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:19.340
We can't ignore our staff's well-being.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.470
Ms. Xin, you see.

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:25.150
Our employees are introverts.

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:26.213
They have no social life.

00:18:26.257 --> 00:18:28.740
At this rate,
their lives would be affected.

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:29.950
I suggest that we hold

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:32.740
a matchmaking event

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:33.580
to create a platform

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:34.710
that breaks social boundaries

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:37.230
and improves team building.

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:41.591
Mr. Pei, you want them to fall in love

00:18:41.613 --> 00:18:44.190
so that they get distracted
from work, right?

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:46.500
How could you think so badly of me?

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.340
It's just that Zhongdian Web Fiction

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.150
is finally off the ground,

00:18:51.191 --> 00:18:53.260
so I wanted to let everyone
get to know one another.

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:54.670
They're all single.

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:56.580
This would help them work better, too.

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:00.950
Fine, I understand.

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:01.580
According to

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:03.500
Chapter 126, No. 72,

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.500
such events may not last
for more than a day.

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:06.710
No problem.

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:10.580
Ms. Xin.

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:11.260
If you're free,

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:12.540
you can join, too.

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:17.190
Do I look like I need matchmaking?

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:35.910
Zhongdian Web Fiction authors

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:38.340
and Tengda Games employees'

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:41.230
first-ever matchmaking event

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:42.910
officially begins!

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:47.150
Actually, this event

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:48.990
is meant to encourage everyone

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:50.820
to use your working hours

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.260
to solve your personal issues.

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:54.190
So, don't get stressed out.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.190
If things don't work out,

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:57.390
at least you met a new friend.

00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:58.630
If it's a match,

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:00.710
we will cover

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:03.300
all your wedding costs!

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:04.500
Good luck, everyone!

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:07.060
- Thank you, Mr. Pei!
- Thanks, Mr. Pei!

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:12.020
Come on.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.740
Introduce yourselves.

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:15.150
Let's start with you.

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:16.820
Okay.

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:18.430
Hello.

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:19.580
I'm Cui Geng,

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:21.100
pen name...

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:21.470
No.

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:23.500
Introduce your name in the board game.

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:25.580
I'm the Beauty.

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:28.950
Mr. Pei.

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:30.340
This seat is for you.

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:44.060
Lin Wan, look.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.820
It's a matchmaking event,

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:47.710
but now

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:49.950
everyone's either playing games

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:50.950
or talking about work.

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:53.100
I can't feel love in the air.

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:04.660
(Roses and you spell romance)

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.060
Did you tell me

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.740
that Returning to Shore is almost done?

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:36.990
Yes.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:40.870
Mr. Pei, you said we shouldn't
discuss work, right?

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.910
Yes.

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:44.340
No discussing work.

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:51.340
Hello. Let me add you on WeChat.

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:55.190
Hello. Your WeChat.

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:56.430
Excuse me for a while.

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:57.100
Ma Yang is almost

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.500
losing control of himself.

00:21:58.500 --> 00:21:59.580
I need to stop him.

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:00.340
Okay.

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:01.580
Mr. Pei!

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:04.670
What are you doing?

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:05.820
I'm socializing.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:13.740
Hello.

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:14.630
Hello.

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:16.540
You must be Lin Wan,
Tengda Games' game planner.

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:17.950
Yes, I am.

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:18.950
I am

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:21.540
a contract writer
in Zhongdian Web Fiction,

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:22.710
The Smart Idiot.

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:23.870
Hello.

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:26.950
Were you on a date with Mr. Pei?

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:28.580
No.

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:30.340
It's okay. I saw you

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:32.100
telling Mr. Pei off.

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:33.580
No.

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.670
Actually, I admire

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:37.740
a girl with grit and perseverance.

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:40.710
I've been into poetry since young.

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:42.500
You like poetry too?

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:44.950
Whether it's sonnets or limericks,

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:47.150
I've written some impressive ones.

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:49.630
What is he doing?

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.820
One of them is about a beauty.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.260
It suits you well.

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.100
Let me read it out for you.

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:55.580
"Hold my hand..."

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:56.260
Excuse me.

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.430
We have work to do.

00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:58.500
Excuse me.

00:22:58.670 --> 00:22:59.580
Excuse me.

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:01.540
Saving a damsel in distress?

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:12.630
Hao Qiong?

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:14.020
Why are you here, all alone?

00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:15.910
Yeah.

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:17.500
Sibo, if you're not busy,

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:18.390
you can sit here

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:19.020
and talk to me.

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:21.150
No, I still need

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:22.430
to check on everyone.

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:23.150
Well,

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:24.670
I'll get you a bright young fellow.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:25.740
No.

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:27.100
Let's see...

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:30.630
Huang, over here.

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:31.150
Bo.

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:31.820
Come on.

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:32.990
He's a fine lad.

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:33.870
Sit down.

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:34.910
Have fun chatting.

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:35.870
Have fun.

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:42.500
(Hu Yue, Zhongdian Web Fiction writer)

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:52.710
Hu...

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:53.300
Yue?

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:58.020
You're on the list,

00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.430
so why aren't you joining everyone?

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:02.230
I signed up because I thought

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:03.340
it was compulsory.

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:05.780
Actually, I don't do well
in events like this.

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:07.060
I get it.

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:08.670
Me too. That's why I asked Mr. Pei

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:09.780
to let me decorate the site.

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:12.060
It's okay.

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:13.870
If you don't like it,
just stay here and read.

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:14.390
It's okay.

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:15.150
Okay.

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:35.630
That's a lot of food.

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:36.740
Sorry to trouble you.

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:37.340
Not at all.

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:38.540
I'm hungry too.

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:40.150
Here.

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:41.670
Thanks.

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:44.630
I remember your name.

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:46.300
You seem to be new here.

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:47.150
How is it?

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:50.870
I've been writing novels,

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:52.230
but I don't have a lot of readers,

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:53.670
so I was about to give up.

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:55.300
Then, a writer from Zhongdian

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:56.500
encouraged me,

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.340
and I decided to join.

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.820
I thought I could learn something,

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:03.430
but I haven't done any real work.

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:04.580
My first task

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:06.230
is to join this matchmaking event.

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:08.580
Your boss is so weird.

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.950
That's not it.

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:12.060
Mr. Pei

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:13.670
is worried that we don't have time

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:14.150
for dating,

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:15.540
so he created this event.

00:25:15.568 --> 00:25:17.457
Mr. Pei is a great boss.

00:25:17.724 --> 00:25:19.430
He's concerned
that our work would affect

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:21.020
our social lives.

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.100
Anyway, he cares for his employees.

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:26.060
You don't believe me, right?

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:27.820
It took me some time to realize

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.710
that Tengda is a dream factory
for employees.

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:33.430
I feel like

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:34.540
I'm brainwashing myself.

00:25:34.613 --> 00:25:36.191
It's okay. You'll understand in time.

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:40.230
You said

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:41.950
a writer from Zhongdian

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:42.670
encouraged you?

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:46.230
He's a nice guy.

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:48.740
He replied to my messages
and motivated me.

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:49.710
Also,

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:52.190
he writes about the working people,

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:53.340
and it's very realistic.

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:54.150
I suspect

00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:55.580
he must have been a corporate mule

00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:56.950
to be able to write that.

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:00.340
Is that so?

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:02.740
What's

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:04.340
his name?

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:07.470
He's got a cute name.

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:09.020
An unusual one.

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.340
Ma Dubiao.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:13.020
An amazing name.

It's a cool name, too.

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:31.820
It's

Pay to enter?

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:05.670
So expensive?

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:07.820
20 yuan for 10 minutes?

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:09.100
What a rip-off.

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:11.230
Darling, look.

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:12.230
What is this?

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:13.340
A phone booth?

Scan to pay?

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:17.950
20 yuan?

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.470
What's inside?

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:21.020
Isn't this a phone booth?

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.020
I don't see a phone.

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:24.390

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:32.100
Good booth.

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:33.300
Good work in losing money.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.390
Keep it up.

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:35.500
When I earn big,

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:36.870
I'll give you a makeover.

(Shared Phone Booth)

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:48.430
Great location.

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:50.950
Not a single shared bike around.

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:12.300
Time to upgrade my transportation.

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:23.820
I hope he buys it,

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:25.990
or else I'm getting fired.

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:39.580
Boss.

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:42.260
Boss?

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:48.820
Well,

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:50.710
what do you think of the car?

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:52.020
It's a nice car.

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:53.150
I think

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:54.060
I'll take this.

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:54.968
Get the invoice ready.

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:55.820
Mr. Pei.

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:57.670
You were just browsing earlier,

00:28:57.670 --> 00:28:59.060
so I didn't remind you

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:02.300
that, according to Chapter 12, No. 76,

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:04.820
you may only purchase
business cars for office use.

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:05.670
Racecars?

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:06.870
No.

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:08.150
Why can't I get a racecar?

00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:08.780
This car

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:10.500
represents our company's image.

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:12.300
When I drive a racecar,

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:13.060
our partners

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:14.430
would trust me more.

00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:16.710
I'm afraid racecars
can't convince everyone

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:18.870
that you are a mature businessman.

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:20.500
How is a racecar immature?

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.710
Look.

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:22.470
Look at

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:23.260
the huge bonnet.

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:24.470
And this.

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:25.340
The rear wing.

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:26.230
And the door.

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:27.710
And this practical base.

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:29.230
How is it immature?

00:29:30.168 --> 00:29:32.950
Buying a car doesn't even meet
our requirements in the first place.

00:29:33.124 --> 00:29:34.280
I only approved it

00:29:34.346 --> 00:29:36.150
because you insisted
it was for business.

00:29:36.346 --> 00:29:38.230
If you keep using our money
for personal gain,

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:39.870
I'll add another clause

00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:41.780
that stops you from buying cars.

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:42.340
You...

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:45.060
I'm telling you,

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:47.060
you don't have
to be harsh on me, Ms. Xin.

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:48.300
Let me make this clear.

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:49.910
If I can't buy this car, I...

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:52.100
I...

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:52.820
Boss.

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:56.740
Why don't you look at...

00:29:59.746 --> 00:30:01.191
(Jinchuan Automobiles)
That car?

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:04.300
That car is almost

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:05.910
similar to this racecar

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:07.430
in terms of functionality.

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.340
You're right.

00:30:11.457 --> 00:30:12.524
I'll buy that car, then.

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:16.060
Really?

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:18.230
Thank you, boss!

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:20.060
I'll do anything

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:21.990
to make this deal work!

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:23.020
You don't have to...

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:23.540
Thank you!

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:24.540
It's okay.

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:25.110
Here...

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:50.670
Who's still working at this hour?

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:51.910
Outrageous!

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:01.260
Lin Wan!

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:03.820
Mr. Pei?

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:05.035
What brings you here?

00:31:05.057 --> 00:31:06.324
Didn't I get Wu Sheng and Wu Xi

00:31:06.346 --> 00:31:07.760
to cancel your overtime permission?

00:31:07.768 --> 00:31:08.746
How did you get in?

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:11.820
I asked the security guard to let me in.

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:12.740
Impossible.

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:13.990
Why would they let you in?

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:15.770
It's not like your family
owns the building...

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:19.980

Lin Wan.

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:24.150
As a rich kid,

00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:25.580
you should behave like one.

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:27.260
I've already approved your leave,

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:29.100
so why are you still coming to work?

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:31.540
You need to get rid of your bad habit
of working overtime,

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:32.670
got it?

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:34.740
Repent.

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.630
I've already completed the proposal,

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:38.060
which you haven't approved.

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:39.470
So, I wanted to improve it.

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:40.540
No, I...

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:41.780
I didn't approve it

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:42.990
because I...

00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:44.500
Because I'm too busy lately.

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.740
Your proposal is more than enough.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:48.950
So, you think my proposal

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:50.020
is good enough?

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:51.540
Yes, it is.

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:53.150
Is that an okay from you?

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:55.100
Can Lv and I proceed?

00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:57.950
Yes.

00:31:58.910 --> 00:31:59.910
But,

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:02.060
proceed slowly.

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:03.910
Slow and steady wins the race.

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:06.260
The graphics and mechanics

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:08.020
have to be on par...

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:08.630
No.

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:11.500
They have to exceed top-tier games.

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:12.390
Okay.

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:14.630
Before that,

00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:16.580
follow me.

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:18.230
Where are we having a meeting?

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:26.700
(Xingniao Gym)

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:29.020
Back then, I let you work overtime

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:31.230
to work on the list.

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:32.710
Now that it's done,

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:35.100
it's back to no overtime.

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:38.950
If you need to use up your energy,

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:42.540
come to the gym

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:43.710
every day

00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:45.990
after work.

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.060
Okay, got it.

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:50.060
I'm telling you,

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:51.990
I checked the records.

00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:52.910
You've never used

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:55.260
our entertainment facilities
during work.

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:56.540
You've also never been to the gym,

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.060
even though we paid for your membership.

00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:00.670
This is the closest gym to the office.

00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:02.910
You're not paying attention to rest.

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:04.580
Health is not a trivial issue.

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:06.500
Look how weak you are...

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:08.780
Don't worry.

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:09.630
I just want

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:11.670
to speed up our project.

00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:12.910
My health is fine.

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:15.390
Well,

00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:17.300
if you're so healthy,

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:18.710
did your parents raise you

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:20.630
to work overtime in Tengda?

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:22.060
So,

00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:24.150
from now on, take a photo

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:25.368
whenever you go to the gym.

00:33:25.368 --> 00:33:26.470
Send it to me.

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:29.190
Okay.

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:35.780
Is it that light?

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:44.000
(Tengda)

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.230
Self-made amphibious refrigerator.

00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:50.390
Semi-automatic wooden fish beater.

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:53.430
Automatic three-handed arm
to flick three foreheads at once,

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:55.150
perfect for families with three kids?

00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:56.780
Are these product ideas

00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:58.060
from Zhang Wang?

00:33:58.060 --> 00:33:58.780
Yes.

00:33:58.780 --> 00:33:59.580
They're awesome.

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:00.230
I love them all.

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:02.340
I can't even choose a favorite.

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:03.430
Yeah.

00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:05.500
But it won't be easy to get
Ms. Xin's approval.

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.060
You know, she's too old-fashioned.

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:09.220
Why do we need her approval?

00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:10.430
She doesn't have dreams.

00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:12.100
All she does is roll her eyes.

(Lin Wan)

00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:16.700
Mr. Pei,

00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:18.140
I'm not trying to skip gym,

00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:19.430
but the gym has closed down.

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:23.860
(Lin Wan)

00:34:27.910 --> 00:34:28.870
Come on, Mr. Pei.

00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:30.470
You don't trust me at all?

00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:32.620
You had to video call me to confirm?

00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:33.750
No.

00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:34.870
I believe in you.

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:35.830
I just wanted to confirm

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:37.260
if the gym has closed down for good?

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:38.580
(Xingniao Gym)

00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:39.470
Look.

00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:42.620
I called them to ask.

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:44.660
They said their membership fees

00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:45.620
couldn't compete

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:46.620
with nearby gyms,

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:48.580
and their members
don't have time for exercise.

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:50.500
They've been losing a lot of members.

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:52.660
The only steady source they had
was from Tengda.

00:34:52.910 --> 00:34:55.060
Is that true?
They don't have other clients?

00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:57.140
It's true.

00:34:59.020 --> 00:34:59.910
Got it.

00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:02.020
Don't slack off, though.

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:03.620
Go home and rest.

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:05.435
(Tengda Games)
Just because the gym is closed

00:35:05.435 --> 00:35:07.020
doesn't mean you can slack off and work.

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:07.660
Okay.

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:08.910
The signal here is bad.

00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:10.060
I need to end this call.

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:16.990
Ma Yang.

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:19.060
This is your opportunity

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:20.620
to become a god-tier investor.

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:23.310
Why are you getting so hyped up
after a video call?

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:25.310
Why pull my shirt like that?

You're the boss
who bought a car from me!

Why are you distributing fliers here?

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:49.870
My sales record didn't make the cut,

00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:50.990
so I got fired.
