00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.470
Xiao Man.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.300
General Xiang and Lord He were murdered.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.180
Who do you think carried it out?

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.220
And who is behind it?

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.140
Xiao Man is not clever,

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.980
but no matter what,

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.620
I believe

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.700
the truth

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.300
will surface soon.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.220
Xiao Man.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.620
I remember you once told me

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.060
to dance whenever I felt unhappy.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.940
No wonder.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.020
No wonder what?

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.380
No wonder it has been so long
since I last danced.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.619
It feels as though

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.060
I have forgotten every move.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.420
If only many things in life

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.780
could fade away like that.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.139
Xiao Man was young back then,

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.340
and did not understand.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.860
Only recently did I realize

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.740
that joy does not come from dancing,

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.180
but from the one
who makes you want to dance.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.900
Fate plays cruel tricks.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.659
Many things,

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.900
many people,

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.380
may have been wrong from the very start.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.720
So,

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.059
that childish line

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.780
about dancing away unhappiness,

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.780
please forget it, Your Majesty.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.220
Your Majesty.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.920
There is unrest at the border.
Foreign forces are advancing.

00:02:09.275 --> 00:02:10.395
I understand.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.980
You are much calmer than I expected.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.260
Xiao Man.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.220
The day I both feared and awaited
has finally arrived.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.180
The day we break free has come as well.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.060
I no longer need to play the fool.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.060
Duanmu Zhi.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.379
Summon the Grand Princess
and all ministers

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.379
to the Imperial Study.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.460
Yes.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.620
Xiao Man.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.300
Help me change.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.740
Your Majesty must not lead the campaign
in person. It is far too dangerous.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.739
Aunt, with General Xiang now dead,
there is no commanding general in the army.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.020
The troops are shaken.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.739
Only if I lead them myself

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.500
can this rebellion be put down.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.860
Lead the campaign in person.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.340
Your Majesty.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.700
Once you mount the tiger,

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.420
there is no easy way down.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.979
Your Majesty.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.459
Though leading the campaign yourself
carries real danger,

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.060
if Your Majesty establishes
authority in the army this time,

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.979
then in the court thereafter,

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.380
no one will dare defy your will again.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.659
Your Majesty.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.299
Princess, please be at ease.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.540
I will accompany
His Majesty to the front

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.260
and ensure his safety.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.595
But...

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.980
I only want to look impressive.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.900
I do not actually want to fight.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.780
Sun Gong.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.500
This expedition beyond the frontier,

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.100
I fear it may be dangerous.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.659
Your Majesty, as Minister of War,

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.139
it is my duty to protect you.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.460
I will not shrink from it.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.540
Then it is settled.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.019
Minister Sun.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.460
Tomorrow we march together
to the frontier

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.100
and bring this war to an end.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.180
This march to the frontier

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.220
will you truly collude
with foreign forces,

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.220
and bury Great Qian's elite troops
beyond the pass?

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.500
Yes.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.340
Only by joining with them
can victory be assured.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.819
You and Mother
guarded the frontier for years.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.419
Can you truly bear to let the people

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.739
Father and Mother
once protected with their lives

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.660
suffer the horrors of war again?

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.619
Enough.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.659
You stay in the Capital

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.939
and carry out Uncle's next step.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:34.579
Then...

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.620
Xiao Man.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.100
Ten years have passed.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.500
Do you remember
these carved likeness clearly?

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:40.899
Father,

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:41.980
Mother,

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.580
Uncle in his youth,
and Brother as a boy,

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.460
but not a single one of me.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.460
Mother never
had the chance to carve your likeness.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.140
That is precisely why

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.140
you are the freest of all.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.220
Free?

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.099
People like us

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.974
are bound hand and foot
by resentment and hatred,

00:05:03.975 --> 00:05:05.179
clinging to our very bones,

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.620
with no release.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.980
We only live in misery.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.300
Do you like Chu Ying that much?

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.179
Do you love her deeply,

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.220
my sister-in-law?

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.300
Just call her Princess.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.220
Do not address her as family.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.140
And besides,

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.020
I will sever all ties with her soon.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.740
Do you truly believe what you just said?

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.000
If the Grand Princess
were to march with you,

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:44.779
would you really be able...

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:45.979
There is no if.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.300
She has already decided not to go.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.700
That does not suit her nature.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.860
I find it strange as well.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.900
But perhaps it is for the best.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.259
If there is no revenge,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.220
Uncle and you
will never escape this torment.

00:06:07.312 --> 00:06:08.432
If there is revenge,

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.300
you and I will lose
the ones we love most.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.219
The battlefield is merciless.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.939
It may well be a road of no return,

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.460
with both sides destroyed.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.300
Since that is so,

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.020
I urge you to pull back from the brink,

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.300
and turn back while you still can.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.340
Things have come this far.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.220
There is no turning back now.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.780
Just say no more.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.219
By the end of this month,

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.619
you will be three months pregnant.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.540
Why don't you look pregnant at all?

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.740
Perhaps this child is born different.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.140
Then you do not plan to tell him?

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.620
I must not unsettle his morale.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.340
People are strange.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.900
Once they have something to hold on to,

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.859
they grow softer toward the world,

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.060
without even realizing it.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.500
I want Sun Gong to show
no softness at all,

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.620
to wield the dragon-patterned sword
of the Chu clan,

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.019
and cut down
every enemy at the frontier.

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.100
And if there are
no enemies at the frontier,

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.460
can you face that cruel truth?

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.620
Our recent investigations
found nothing amiss.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.820
I only hope he lives up
to your devotion.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.620
I can feel that he loves me.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.820
That is why I choose
to give him one more chance.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:32.939
Your Majesty.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:33.459
I,

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.859
heir to the Duke of Ying,

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.780
former sixth-rank commander
of the Eastern City Garrison,

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.459
now a fourth-rank blade-bearing guard
at Your Majesty's side, Duanmu Zhi,

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:41.820
request to lead the campaign.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.019
I am willing to go to the frontier
in Your Majesty's stead,

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:44.899
defeat the enemy,

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.259
and defend our realm.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.380
Very well.

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.140
I grant it.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:53.939
Frankly,

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.019
Duanmu Zhi

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.700
is better suited than I am
to command an army.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.979
A fine sword belongs with a true hero.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:00.940
Come.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.940
I bestow my Youlong Sword upon you.

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:05.740
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.979
Your Majesty. Changing commanders
on the eve of battle is a grave risk.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:09.699
And the soldiers...

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.659
If the soldiers can look to General Duanmu

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.739
as the very image
of a Great Qian warrior,

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.779
then on the battlefield

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.179
our forces will be unstoppable,

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.620
and never know defeat.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.420
Duanmu Zhi.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:23.859
Here.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.739
I now appoint you
Commander of the Banner Guards,

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.779
to lead the imperial campaign
in my stead

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.019
and defend the realm.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.140
Yes.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.979
Your Majesty, you must not.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.179
The entire army already knows
you would lead in person.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.059
If you withdraw now,

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:37.779
morale will collapse.

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.699
Yes, Your Majesty.
This is your first time

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.420
establishing authority in the army.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.499
If you withdraw at the last moment,

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.340
wouldn't that make a mockery of it?

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:48.700
A mockery?

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.620
When have I not been a mockery?

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:51.859
When I danced in the palace,

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.699
was that not a mockery to you?

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.220
When I built Yanbo Parlor,
was that not a mockery?

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:00.939
You all see me

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.340
as nothing but an emperor who dances.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.540
Then let it be a mockery.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.980
Since His Majesty has decided,

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.779
we respectfully send off General Duanmu

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.820
and General Sun to the battlefield.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:20.500
May all our generals return in triumph.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.300
May all our generals return in triumph.

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.360
(Five months later)
Signals arrive from the frontier.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.499
The time has come.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:16.620
Move.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:34.859
Reporting, Eunuch.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.219
Our men outside the palace
have taken control of the Capital.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.219
The palace guards inside

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.260
have been nearly wiped out.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.459
As expected of elite troops.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:46.540
But the Grand Princess
is nowhere to be found.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:50.539
Search.

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:51.779
Search the entire palace.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.340
Capture Chu Wuju alive.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.979
I will cut her and Chu Ying to pieces,

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.059
to appease General Xiao's spirit.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.100
Yes.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:06.819
Assassins!

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.180
Protect His Majesty!

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:18.060
(I once had a dream.)

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:23.140
(A dream that filled me with terror.)

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.460
(Could it be today)

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.740
(that dream comes true?)
