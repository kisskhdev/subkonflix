(This story is purely fictional.)

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.910
Welcome to

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.550
the Returning to Shore Cup
Poetry Contest.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.670
(Returning to Shore Cup)
Currently, our record holder is

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:58.470
Qian Liang,

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.390
Mr. Qian!

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.580
- Qian!
- Qian!

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.124
- Press forward without hesitation!
- Press forward without hesitation!

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.180
Up next, let's welcome

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.830
today's challenger,

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.950
Mrs. Wang Mingxia!

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.390
Let the contest

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.950
begin!

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.700
Mr. Qian, recite a poem.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.270
He Zhizhang, Tang Dynasty.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.350
Ode to the Willow.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.270
Like emerald jade,
the willow stands so tall,

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.790
ten thousand
green silk ribbons gently fall.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.900
Who cut these slender leaves
so fine and neat?

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.420
The spring breeze in February
is like a pair of scissors.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.140
- Excellent!
- Excellent!

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.790
Mr. Qian, there's no need to worry.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.140
Returning to Shore has
a dialect recognition function.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.390
Mrs. Wang,

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.270
it's your turn now.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.700
Du Fu, Tang Dynasty.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.420
On Hearing That the Imperial Army
Has Recovered Henan and Hebei.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.460
It's said that suddenly
Jibei is recaptured.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.830
At first, I hear it,
tears soak all my clothes.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.230
I turn to see my wife and children.
Where has sorrow gone?

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.830
I loosely roll my books and poems,
joy near madness grows.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.420
In daylight, singing loud,
I must drink deep.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.550
With youth as company,
how gladly I go home.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.270
- Excellent!
- Excellent!

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.900
Liu Changqing, Tang Dynasty.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.550
Seeing Off the Monk Lingche.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.460
In dusky green,
the Bamboo Grove Temple stands.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.990
Faint, distant bells
resound at evening's end.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.350
Wang Wei, Tang Dynasty.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.300
Birdsong Valley.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.790
In quiet ease, osmanthus blossoms fall;

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.368
Night deepens,
spring hills lie empty, still.

00:03:41.368 --> 00:03:42.620
Wang Bo, Tang Dynasty.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.830
In the Mountains.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.849
The long river grieves,
its course seemingly stalled.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.960
From ten thousand miles away,
my heart yearns for home.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.550
Wang Changling, Tang Dynasty.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.213
(Poetry Contest)
Seeing Off Guo, the Clerk.

00:03:51.213 --> 00:03:53.110
The Huai River
glimmers green beside the gate.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.146
Reined-in horses linger,
bound by the host's heart.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.670
Lu You, Song Dynasty.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:59.950
The Long Ballad.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.110
The nation's wrongs unavenged,
heroes grow old.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.390
At night, the treasured sword
in its case still rings.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.510
When shall we triumph,
feast the valiant host;

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.990
As midnight snow
weighs down Feihu City's walls?

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.350
(Victory)

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.230
- Excellent!
- Excellent!

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.020
Excellent!

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.500
Mr. Qian, that's alright.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:19.910
You've already done great.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.790
We still have plenty
of prizes waiting for you.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.550
(Sloth Gym)
This is a lifetime membership card

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.990
for Tengda's Sloth Gym.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.990
This is great!

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.820
Come, Mr. Qian.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.110
Let's take a group photo

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.150
as a keepsake.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.150
(Returning to Shore Cup,
Jinchuan City's First Poetry Contest)

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.620
Recently,

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.146
the Returning to Shore Cup,
Jinchuan City's First Poetry Contest,

00:04:39.146 --> 00:04:40.470
has been held in full swing

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.324
at multiple parks and communities

00:04:42.346 --> 00:04:43.590
across the city.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:44.550
(It is reported)

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.300
(that this surge in
poetry-reciting enthusiasm)

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.260
(is linked to a game titled)

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.435
(Jinchuan City's First Poetry Contest)
(Returning to Shore.)

00:04:49.435 --> 00:04:51.500
(The game gained rapid popularity)

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.435
(and sparked widespread social attention)

00:04:53.435 --> 00:04:54.480
(due to its unique design)

00:04:54.502 --> 00:04:57.260
(that cleverly integrates elements
of classical poetry into gameplay.)

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.680
(The game "Returning to Shore"
is a platform where gaming meets)

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.102
(traditional culture to spark new ideas.)

00:05:01.124 --> 00:05:03.300
Not all video games are bad for us.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.380
There can also be games
that combine education

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.146
with entertainment
and help people improve.

00:05:07.146 --> 00:05:07.990
Tengda

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.740
has always held such a belief.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.180
We devote ourselves to developing

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.420
more positive

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.620
and meaningful games for players.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:15.990
(For Returning to Shore,)

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.230
(not only did we develop)

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.860
(the Poetry Contest Mini Program)

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.368
(and hold the Top Ranking Contest,)

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.500
(but we also held many offline events)

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.420
(in the city.)

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.620
(Our goal is to enable
groups beyond players to join in)

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.860
(and foster a nationwide passion)

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.990
(for classical poetry culture.)

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:32.990
What do you guys think?

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.420
Bao, you looked pretty photogenic.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.180
Really?

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.813
You looked much more energetic on TV.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.500
But it feels awkward
when I see myself on TV.

00:05:40.613 --> 00:05:42.746
Ms. Lin Wan, people
have been contacting me non-stop.

00:05:42.746 --> 00:05:44.860
They're requesting authorization
for a poetry event.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:45.940
Me too.

00:05:45.968 --> 00:05:47.680
Numerous university clubs,
community groups,

00:05:47.746 --> 00:05:49.680
and even senior universities
have approached us.

00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:51.500
Many people had
signed up for the event online.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.924
It's way more than I had imagined.

00:05:52.946 --> 00:05:55.168
We need to test the mini program
as soon as possible.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.740
Alright.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.300
Let's do it, then.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.180
Time to work.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.940
Returning to Shore Program Team!

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.110
Come to the meeting room!

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.110
I'm sorry, Mr. Pei.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.420
The hype of Returning to Shore

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.380
is primarily focused on
schools, communities,

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.670
and the elderly.

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:16.990
Judging by the current trend,

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.110
we can only break even at most

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.620
by the end of the month.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.550
It's way less than Divine General Pact

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.260
and Deserted Island Sharpshooter.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.110
It's our fault.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.500
Did you say

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.060
that Returning to Shore
will break even this month?

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.550
Barely.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.740
This is primarily due to your strategy.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.380
My strategy?

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.260
What strategy?

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.110
Did you forget?

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.420
When I asked you about
the game's promotion,

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.670
you told me to increase
the publicity cost

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.500
and spend as much money as I should.

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:53.670
So, that's why you held
a lucky draw in Jinchuan, huh?

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:58.820
Lv,

00:06:59.124 --> 00:07:00.230
I'm sure you've devoted

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.060
a lot of effort into
this project as well.

00:07:02.591 --> 00:07:04.620
So, did you just come to
and get off work on time

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.568
just to set up
a good image in front of me?

00:07:06.591 --> 00:07:07.990
No. Mr. Pei, that's not it.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.591
This project...

00:07:08.613 --> 00:07:10.380
He didn't work overtime at all.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.500
He was just fast and efficient
in writing code.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.550
Yeah.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:14.968
Mr. Pei, after that, I realized

00:07:15.013 --> 00:07:17.030
that you were different
from other business owners.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.110
That's why I wanted to try my best.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.990
But don't worry.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.368
Although I don't work overtime,

00:07:21.391 --> 00:07:22.857
I promise to finish my tasks on time.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.940
It's because this job
is a piece of cake for me.

00:07:26.146 --> 00:07:27.280
Mr. Pei, before this, you said

00:07:27.324 --> 00:07:30.110
that Returning to Shore must strive to
reach the standard of a top-tier game

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:31.724
and that the investment in art resources

00:07:31.724 --> 00:07:33.500
must be maximized.
Since you were so supportive,

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.080
Ruan Guangjian and his department
actually gave this project their all.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.940
The original artwork
is absolutely stunning.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.420
Mr. Pei, Ruan Guangjian is here.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.550
Mr. Pei,

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.380
I have to apologize to you.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:49.657
I admit I did a half-hearted job

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.940
on Divine General Pact's artwork.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:51.940
Sorry about that.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:52.860
It was because

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:53.790
I thought you were

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:54.380
a terrible...

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.110
No, I mean,

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:56.550
an ordinary business owner.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:57.820
That's why I gave you that.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:58.620
I didn't expect you

00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.990
to let me pass on the first draft.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:01.420
And, you even paid me a lot for it.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:02.502
My partners and I thought

00:08:02.502 --> 00:08:03.550
that we'd let you down.

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:04.500
Therefore, this time,

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.940
I'll surely do my best.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.035
Back when Guangjian was at rock bottom,

00:08:08.035 --> 00:08:08.810
fresh out of school,

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:10.940
he was tormented by his client
until he questioned his existence.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:11.870
But after meeting you,

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:13.991
he thought that producing
excellent work was worth it.

00:08:14.013 --> 00:08:16.180
The ink-wash style Lin Wan had chosen

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.300
fits perfectly with poetry.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.470
Thus, I was hugely inspired.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.180
Mr. Ruan, it's all thanks
to your excellent work.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.724
It has gone viral in the original art,

00:08:24.746 --> 00:08:26.740
cosplay and the ancient
art style communities.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:27.880
It has become widely popular.

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:40.470
Thanks to you,

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:41.470

After we met
at the phone booth that day,

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.190
I had LASIK surgery the other day.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:47.413
Now that his vision is normal,
he draws much faster.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:49.500
But the problem is,

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.780
ours is a soul-like.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.830
It's a difficult game.

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:54.950
And, it has a theme related to poetry.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:56.919
The sarcasm is off the charts.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.230
Who actually plays a game like this?

00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:59.590
Mr. Pei, you're right.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:01.380
This time, besides conventional gamers,

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.830
we also received many organic fans.

Returning to Shore

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:06.710
has sparked a nationwide craze
for learning classical poetry.

00:09:06.724 --> 00:09:08.435
Even public opinion has turned positive.

Why didn't you guys

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.500
tell me about it earlier?

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:28.380

that our back-end data was skyrocketing.

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:39.140

have the same thought.

I won't cause any trouble for you.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:04.620

that an employee like me

this is my first time seeing you

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:39.590
so generous

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:41.140
with giving Yakult away.

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:43.950
What do you know?

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:45.190
In the business world,

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.260
a generous heart

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.590
will earn you the world.

00:16:00.746 --> 00:16:01.860
Prepare a car for me.

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:02.740
Okay.

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:07.740
(Mingyun Villa)

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:21.990
All your dishes have arrived.
Please enjoy.

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.310
Isn't this the fish I just caught?

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:25.070
It's super fresh.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.310
Alright, thank you so much.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:27.213
Go and take a bath.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:28.140
Okay.

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:31.860
Mr. Li Jr.,

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:34.260
I appreciate your kind intention,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.380
but can you please not
treat me to a meal next time?

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.500
Just wire the money to my account, okay?

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:41.380
Mr. Pei,

00:16:41.724 --> 00:16:43.620
you still like to crack jokes,
don't you?

00:16:44.146 --> 00:16:46.124
When I invited you
to Ming House for a meal,

00:16:46.146 --> 00:16:47.430
you rejected me every time.

00:16:47.435 --> 00:16:49.380
Now, I've come all the way
to your private kitchen

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:50.660
and caught a fish here.

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.540
I'm sure you'll enjoy
the meal now, right?

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.780
I'm not joking.

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.540
I was dealt

00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:58.780
a serious blow in life recently.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:00.540
I'm at my lowest point in life.

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.710
I won't be able to last for long.

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:05.300
To be honest,

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:07.470
I can barely pay my mortgage now.

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:08.820
The meal you're having today

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:10.710
is costing me a few months'
worth of expenses.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:14.990
Mr. Pei, I didn't expect you
to be this straightforward.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.230
It seems you do take me
as a real friend.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:20.950
Mr. Pei,

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:22.390
when it comes to business,

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:24.060
having a tight cash flow

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.540
is actually quite common.

00:17:25.568 --> 00:17:27.546
I do find myself in
that situation sometimes as well.

00:17:27.568 --> 00:17:28.390
Don't worry about it.

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:30.710
Perfect timing.

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:32.990
I think the 20 million yuan
I invested in Sloth Gym

00:17:33.213 --> 00:17:34.813
should have arrived
in your bank account.

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:36.390
I hope it can help you

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:37.780
resolve your crisis.

00:17:43.191 --> 00:17:44.740
Wait. Were you the one who invested

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.540
20 million in us?

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:50.820
I told you already.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.300
I'm trying to make it
a win-win situation here.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:55.580
And, in addition

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:56.910
to these twenty million,

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.820
all future profits from my gym

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.580
will also be shared with you.

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:02.820
Mr. Pei, calm down for now.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:03.670
Actually,

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:04.950
I came here today

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:06.060
because...

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:08.580
Mainly, I wanted you

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.580
to reveal the next step

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:14.910
of our investment plan.

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:16.670
What should we do next?

00:18:17.791 --> 00:18:20.190
What other trashy investment projects
does Jinchuan have?

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:24.540
The kind of project

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:26.020
that, at first glance,

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.260
could save my life,

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.740
and simultaneously
wipe out your entire 20 million.

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.150
You don't understand at all.

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:32.340
Those projects

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:33.300
are too common.

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.150
They're not enough.

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:36.499
I need that kind of godsend project,

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:37.991
the kind nobody else wants to touch.

00:18:37.991 --> 00:18:39.480
The bigger the project, the better.

00:18:39.524 --> 00:18:40.880
The more investment, the better!

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:47.020
I think I understand something.

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:48.670
You see,

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:49.260
Mr. Pei,

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:51.580
you don't have
sufficient funds right now.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:52.190
That's right.

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.060
Even so, you don't want

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:56.300
a stable project that can
make us a stable profit.

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.430
You think it's pointless.

00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:59.150
Now, you want

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:01.740
to make a huge comeback, right?

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:07.710
Fine.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.390
I'll share all of my investment secrets

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:11.540
with you today.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:12.230
Okay.

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:14.710
Buy on dips, not rallies.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:16.390
Seek losses, not gains.

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:17.390
Mr. Li Jr.,

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:19.910
do you know if there
are any projects in Jinchuan

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:23.390
that are at the bottom

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.260
of Jinchuan's investment chain?

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.340
I've just thought of one.

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:36.870
Mr. Pei,

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:39.470
why are you drawn to this project?

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:45.190
This place is pretty nice.

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:47.430
This is the only building
within a ten-mile radius.

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:50.300
It's not obstructed by anything.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:51.950
The developer positions this project

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:54.280
as an urban landmark
that has integrated diverse functions,

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.870
including high-end apartments,
quality residences,

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:59.190
and trendy commercial districts.

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:00.100
They also intend

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:02.680
to develop a gigantic city park.

00:20:02.902 --> 00:20:03.835
It's right downstairs.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:04.630
A park?

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:06.340
Where is it?

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:11.190
It's right under our feet.

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:16.230
At least a corner of it.

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:18.990
This is something else.

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:25.670
This...

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:38.910
It's quite rough around the edges, huh?

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:52.390
According to the materials,

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:54.630
traffic here is convenient.

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:55.990
There's only a dirt road.

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:59.060
With elevated highways
extending in all directions.

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:01.390
They're not connected to anywhere.

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:03.500
With outstanding infrastructure.

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:05.230
It's empty and desolate.

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:06.910
And, in the future, it'll...

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.190
Mr. Pei, I can't make myself read it.

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:11.124
Why don't you read it...

00:21:11.146 --> 00:21:11.670
I'm buying it.

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:15.910
I'm buying

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:17.820
the entire building.

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:20.470
Mr. Pei.

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:22.740
You are

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.820
truly extraordinary.

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:40.230
So, Pei...

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:40.990
No, I mean,

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:42.100
Mr. Pei.

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:43.340
I thought you called me here

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:45.100
to discuss Mingri Apartments.

00:21:45.324 --> 00:21:47.230
Why did you get yourself
another apartment?

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:50.910
Mingri Apartments belonged to me.

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:52.260
The one Tengda had bought

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.780
belonged to my family.

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:55.390
How could I renovate my own place

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:58.230
without renovating
my family's place first?

00:21:58.340 --> 00:21:59.500
Mr. Pei,

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.670
your dedication to your career
is truly admirable.

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:03.390
No wonder you're the boss.

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:04.910
I thought you were just a deadbeat.

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:06.870
No.

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:07.670
I mean,

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:10.230
since you're entrusting such
a huge project to us,

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:12.190
I definitely won't let you down.

00:22:12.502 --> 00:22:13.746
This is our design proposal for

00:22:13.746 --> 00:22:15.710
the interior style of
Tengda's apartments.

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:16.910
Let me show you.

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:19.390
This is the creamy Instagram-style look.

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:21.910
This is the minimalist look.

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:23.910
And, there's one look
that suits you perfectly.

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:25.990
It's the Splendor of Success look.

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.670
Of course.

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:29.100
We also offer a new
Chinese-style light classical look.

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:34.340
They're too traditional.

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:36.390
If so, please tell me your request.

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:37.780
Mr. Liang,

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:39.190
is it possible

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:40.630
to equip Tengda's apartments

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:41.870
with more amenities

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:43.591
than any other apartments on the market?

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.413
We will provide users
with 100-inch 4K TVs,

00:22:45.435 --> 00:22:46.990
a complete professional audio system,

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:49.710
a screen with a projector,
a variety of viewing options,

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:51.670
even gaming consoles,

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:54.820
an automatic clothes dryer
that can gather dust automatically,

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:56.630
a cleaning robot,

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:57.710
smart locks,

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:00.670
and a leather sofa
with a fully-functional massage system.

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:02.710
And smart home appliances as well.

00:23:03.613 --> 00:23:05.340
Regarding the AI human
body sensing system

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:07.100
you mentioned last time,

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:08.060
we'll install that too.

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:10.870
Mr. Pei,

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.390
if you include all of that,

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:15.910
the cost will be quite substantial.

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:18.100
For the sake of the users' experience,

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:20.150
the cost shouldn't matter.

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:20.910
Mr. Liang,

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:22.390
just go ahead and shop with confidence.

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:24.470
We won't aim for the best,

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:25.990
but we'll aim for the most expensive!

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:26.740
Alright.

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.670
And, don't worry.
With our company as a guarantor,

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:29.946
your wages won't be defaulted.

00:23:30.013 --> 00:23:30.670
Alright.

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:31.500
Mr. Pei,

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:32.710
if so, does that mean

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:34.657
we need to step up
our hard furnishing game too?

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:38.230
If both hard furnishings
and interior decor are top-notch,

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.500
the apartments will sell like hotcakes.

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:41.580
You see,

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:43.740
I know the interior decor
is already extravagant.

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:45.346
But when it comes
to the hard furnishings,

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:47.568
we should go for a huge contrast.

00:23:47.613 --> 00:23:49.230
The bigger the contrast is, the better.

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:50.500
I've decided.

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:53.260
We won't put any wallpaper,

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:54.910
any flooring,

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:56.390
or paint the unit.

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:58.740
Walls and floors are pure concrete.

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:00.430
It's all about that raw
and unpolished look.

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:02.190
We'll show them
the scene of ruins and rubble,

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:03.546
with a refreshing change of pace.

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:07.470
Mr. Pei,

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:09.430
wouldn't this style of interior design

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:10.910
be too avant-garde?

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:11.910
I'm worried

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:13.910
that many clients won't be
able to accept it.

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:16.430
How could that be the case?

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:17.670
You see, I...

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:20.430
I mean, a friend of mine

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.630
actually moved straight
into an unfurnished house.

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.670
And, he's still living there.

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:29.950
That's what Tengda does.

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:31.990
We only attract people
with the same frequency.

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:33.146
We never force relationships.

00:24:33.191 --> 00:24:34.670
And, Mr. Liang, remember this.

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:36.760
The users are strictly prohibited
from doing their own renovations.

00:24:36.768 --> 00:24:38.546
We must retain
the authenticity of the apartments.

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.910
Okay.

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:41.630
Understood.

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:43.150
Mr. Pei,

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:45.430
but in the future,

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:48.230
how are we supposed
to introduce this unit to our clients?

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.230
I mean, the huge contrasting style

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:54.060
that you're going for.

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:00.230
This apartment

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.340
is drafty on all sides

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:04.630
and bare.

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:08.190
We'll call it

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:10.710
the Four Wall Apartments.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:16.860
(Shenhua International)

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:18.060
Mr. Liang,

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:19.670
I'll be depending on you in the future.

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:21.100
Mr. Pei!

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:26.950
No worry. Just spend the money quickly
and without any hesitation.

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:28.230
Tengda will back you up.

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:29.500
Don't save any money for us.

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:30.635
- Alright, Mr. Pei.
- Okay?

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:32.340
Okay, Mr. Pei.

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:37.390
Mr. Pei,

00:25:37.591 --> 00:25:38.580
I finally caught you.

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:39.670
Are you free now?

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:46.470
Mr. Pei, now that Returning to Shore

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:47.670
is officially on track,

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:49.060
I've made another

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:50.300
preliminary game design proposal

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:51.950
for an MMORPG.

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:53.591
It's called
The Divine Mountains and Seas.

00:25:53.635 --> 00:25:54.324
Please review it.

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:55.470
(Preliminary Game Design Proposal)
No rush.

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:57.657
You've worked overtime
every day on Returning to Shore.

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:58.809
It's already been tough on you.

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:00.813
Other employers
might only care about your results,

00:26:00.813 --> 00:26:01.710
but I only care about

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:03.390
how much sleep you've gotten.

00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:05.470
When you're free,

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:07.057
you should head to Sloth Gym more often

00:26:07.124 --> 00:26:07.813
and rest there.

00:26:07.857 --> 00:26:08.500
I saw online

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.390
that many people with insomnia
have been cured.

00:26:11.546 --> 00:26:12.359
Mr. Pei, it's fine.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.502
I'm not suffering from insomnia.
I'm not tired either.

00:26:14.502 --> 00:26:16.260
I just wanted to show you my proposal.

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:17.670
I see great potential in this game.

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:19.950
I can feel your enthusiasm.

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:21.820
However, since its founding,

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.990
Tengda has released four games.

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:25.500
And, each of them is very popular.

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:28.470
It's perplexing indeed.

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:30.430
I often wondered

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:31.835
if we truly had the capability

00:26:31.835 --> 00:26:33.390
to create such hit games

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:35.540
and whether or not
we deserve all of this.

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:39.500
Mr. Pei,

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:41.740
every time Sky Fire releases a game,

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.710
they think they're amazing.

00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:45.657
But you? You reflect upon
your past actions.

00:26:45.657 --> 00:26:46.630
You're already better

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:48.580
than 99% of our peers.

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:51.780
But the development of Tengda Game

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:52.950
has stalled.

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:54.990
I think our priority is to...

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:56.670
I think our priority is to

00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:58.390
think.

00:26:58.500 --> 00:26:59.670
We need to figure out

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:01.746
the kind of games that
current users like to play.

00:27:01.746 --> 00:27:03.580
We need to figure out how to create

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.390
a groundbreaking

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:07.670
and innovative game.

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:13.470
Mr. Pei,

00:27:13.857 --> 00:27:16.670
could it be that you're not interested
in developing new games at all?

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:21.670
How could that be?

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:22.470
Don't worry.

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:24.470
I'll surely review your proposal.

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:26.230
You must remember this too.

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:27.020
Think more,

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:27.990
feel more,

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:29.430
and produce less.

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:34.580
Mr. Pei!

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:35.820
That's my laptop!

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:44.580
Could it be
that my idea was too immature?

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:46.870
Was it why Mr. Pei
was uninterested in it?

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:50.150
I don't think that's possible.

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:51.950
I've reviewed your proposal

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:54.100
thoroughly.

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:56.470
As the chief playtester of Tengda Game,

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:57.580
I can tell you this

00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.340
with the gaming instinct
I was born with.

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:01.391
If we make The Divine Mountains and Seas

00:28:01.413 --> 00:28:02.480
according to your proposal,

00:28:02.502 --> 00:28:03.540
it'll definitely be a hit.

00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:04.368
I feel the same.

00:28:04.391 --> 00:28:06.710
I want to play the game
just from reading your proposal alone.

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:10.390
Do you guys truly think so?

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:14.150
But Mr. Pei told me to reflect upon it

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:16.150
and be more innovative.

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.302
That's because
he didn't read your proposal.

00:28:18.302 --> 00:28:20.213
How else can your proposal
be more innovative?

00:28:20.235 --> 00:28:21.340
What's there to reflect upon?

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:22.740
He'll know that this game

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:24.950
is the kind
that he wants to develop after reading

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:26.990
your proposal.

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:31.390
Thanks, Bao, Lv.

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:33.990
I almost lost all confidence just now.

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:35.324
But after hearing that from you two,

00:28:35.324 --> 00:28:36.260
I feel pretty touched.

00:28:37.124 --> 00:28:38.500
Why don't we work on it together?

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:41.150
With Bao's meticulousness

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:42.910
and Lv's technical support,

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:44.430
we'll definitely hit the mark.

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:46.100
It'll definitely shut Mr. Pei up.

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:47.390
Sure.

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.260
But, wait, I'm not working overtime.

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:51.260
Mr. Pei caught me
when I worked overtime last time.

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:52.670
If he catches me again,

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:54.260
I'll be in huge trouble.

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:56.470
I have to be useless

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:58.260
so that people won't be able to use me.

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.050
I know that.
I won't tell you to work overtime.

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:01.060
I just want to know if you...

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:01.820
No.

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:14.260
Bao,

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:16.870
without the support of

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:18.910
a world-class

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:20.470
and god-tier

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:21.710
back-end developer like Lv,

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:23.230
we should be mentally prepared.

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:26.100
It'll take us at least
60 years to complete the game.

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.100
Yeah.

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:28.230
You see,

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:31.390
without the help of a prodigy like Lv,

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:33.540
there's no way
The Divine Mountains and Seas

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:35.670
can be as perfect as we imagined.

00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:36.910
Yeah.

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:38.100
What a shame.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.190
Wait.

00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:45.870
I'm quite interested

00:29:46.813 --> 00:29:48.300
in The Divine Mountains and Seas.

00:29:58.740 --> 00:29:59.870
I can help you guys

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:02.150
when I slack off during work hours.

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:05.740
You're welcome.

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:07.580
Cheers.

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:08.470
Cheers.

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:18.670
Four Wall Apartments is my last bet.

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:20.390
I absolutely cannot let

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:23.057
the previous tragedy of
back-to-back betrayals happen again.

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:26.260
All those betrayers

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.950
could always find my weaknesses

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:29.230
and target them.

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:32.260
No.

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:36.260
I have to form a department
and keep them in check.

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:52.190
Pei...

00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:03.100
Mr. Pei,

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:04.820
what's going on here?

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:07.540
You actually recognized me?

00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:09.990
Put this on and turn around.

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:11.820
Turn around.

00:31:12.124 --> 00:31:14.060
This concerns Tengda's
confidential information.

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:15.190
Do not show it to anyone.

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:16.670
Tang,

00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:19.340
it must've been tough on you

00:31:19.391 --> 00:31:20.680
after joining DreamForge Capital.

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:22.190
I observed you in secret.

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:24.820
I found out
that although you don't like to speak,

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:26.100
and have a low sense of presence,

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:28.910
you're very trustworthy.

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:31.430
After giving it much consideration,

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:34.820
I've decided to entrust you
with an important mission.

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:36.300
Are you

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:37.950
ready?

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:41.910
The instructions

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.060
are in here.

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:01.700
(Four Wall Apartments)

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:05.340
Mr. Pei, please come in.

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:13.300
The Four Wall Apartments

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:14.835
has reached the handover standards.

00:32:14.857 --> 00:32:15.870
The wall and flooring

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:17.260
are all concrete.

00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:18.740
The furniture and appliances

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:19.820
are top-of-the-line.

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:21.820
It's also equipped with
whole-home smart control.

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:23.630
The users will definitely experience

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:25.020
a stark contrast.

00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:37.260
Mr. Pei,

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:38.670
the whole-home smart control

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:40.150
can be accessed with AI voice control.

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:42.060
As per your design,

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:44.324
we've set up commands
for users to change the scene at will.

00:32:44.324 --> 00:32:45.340
You may give it a try.

00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:49.390
Golden splendor!

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:55.910
Mr. Pei,

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:57.340
you wanted this, right?

00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:59.100
Correct!

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:00.230
Mr. Liang,

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:01.430
your design

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:02.710
matches my requirement perfectly.

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:03.630
Good job.

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:07.710
Cui,

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:10.670
I'll leave the rest to you.

00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:12.820
Mr. Pei,

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:15.540
thank you for your trust.

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:16.630
Thanks to you,

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:18.540
I've been promoted to the regional GM.

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:19.580
It feels so surreal.

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:22.060
What about this?

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:23.470
I'll double-check it with you.

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:24.820
I want to confirm

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:25.910
if you have any requests

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:27.910
concerning the sales
and rental of these units.

00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:29.190
For example, the price and so on.

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:30.500
The Four Wall Apartments

00:33:30.613 --> 00:33:32.060
is only meant for rent, not for sale.

00:33:33.568 --> 00:33:34.710
Only meant for rent?

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:36.580
Only meant for rent, not for sale?

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:37.500
That's right.

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:39.630
To ensure the users' needs are met,

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:41.168
no subletting or short-term rentals

00:33:41.213 --> 00:33:42.430
are allowed here.

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:43.950
We'll provide users

00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:45.990
with 24-hour housekeeping

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.910
and butler services.

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:48.102
Look at all these appliances.

00:33:48.102 --> 00:33:49.910
There will be frequent updates
to their software.

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:51.820
We'll update them on a regular basis.

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:53.835
They're available for lease
starting at ten years,

00:33:53.857 --> 00:33:55.430
with payment required, in full upfront.

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:57.060
In full upfront?

00:33:59.100 --> 00:33:59.670
If so,

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:00.910
Mr. Pei,

00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:02.430
don't you think

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:04.580
the price is too high?

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:05.470
You see,

00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:06.580
for example,

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:09.060
if you wish to take
the high-end approach,

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:12.620
Jinchuan has plenty of wealthy people.

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.140
They have plenty of other choices.

00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:15.430
The thing is,

00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:17.724
you're not allowing the clients
to do their own renovations.

00:34:17.724 --> 00:34:19.540
They have no reason

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:21.470
to choose this unit.

00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:23.220
Mr. Liang,

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:24.580
tell Cui

00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:27.020
about the concept of our apartment.

00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:31.470
With affinity,
even walls cannot keep us apart.

00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:33.990
Without it, even face-to-face, we pass.

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:34.990
That's right.

00:34:35.124 --> 00:34:36.502
Therefore, our apartments

00:34:36.524 --> 00:34:38.500
must strictly adhere
to environmental standards.

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.270
You see, renovation was just finished

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:41.580
not long ago.

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:44.060
It must have high levels
of formaldehyde.

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:46.020
Therefore, we should
leave it for the time being

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:47.180
and let it air.

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:48.470
Mr. Pei,

00:34:48.502 --> 00:34:50.080
we didn't do any renovations at all.

00:34:50.168 --> 00:34:52.470
The furniture we used was all
made from eco-friendly materials.

00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:53.880
We've been airing them for some time.

00:34:53.902 --> 00:34:54.740
As per your request,

00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:56.940
we hired professional help to
remove the formaldehyde smell.

00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:57.480
Three times!

00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:58.899
It's way lower than normal standards.

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:00.020
No need to air them any longer.

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:00.990
Even so, that won't do.

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:03.700
We should follow maternal
and infant safety standards.

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:05.660
For the sake of our children,

00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:08.540
we have to let it air!

Mr. Pei told you to join
the Gaming Division?

00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:00.060
That's right.

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:01.140
Mr. Pei said

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:02.140
my main mission

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:04.180
is to do my internship
in all departments of Tengda.

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:06.270
Do you guys need any help?

00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:08.020
Tang,

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:09.910
you're not in the same field as me.

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:12.870
You don't know how to code either.
I don't need your help.

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:14.580
Lv,

00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:16.540
I have to criticize you for that.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:18.580
Tang is a management trainee.

00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:19.700
She's here to learn.

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:20.580
You know?

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:22.350
You should be nicer to her.

00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:24.660
Tang, it's fine that you don't know
how to code.

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:26.124
You know how to play games, right?

00:36:26.124 --> 00:36:28.180
Come and test
the games with us for now,

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:28.750
okay?

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:31.020
Sure. Thanks, Bao.

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:32.540
It's like this.

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:35.270
The system requirements
for a playtester are quite demanding.

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:37.580
This is the new
top-of-the-line PC I purchased.

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:39.140
You should try it.

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:40.580
Okay.

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:48.870
The Gaming Division is truly different.

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:51.620
Even the keyboard
and screen can be folded, huh?

00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:58.830
Who said it could be folded?

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:01.830
Bao,

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:04.220
why don't we do some playtesting?

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:14.310
Son,

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:16.350
I think I should pick you up.

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:21.660
This...

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:24.310
Why don't we try another move?

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:27.870
Try to stretch your waist slowly,

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:29.580
especially you guys
who always sit too much.

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:35.020
I can't

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:36.870
move my waist.

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:42.500
Mr. Ma.

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:47.500
Mr. Ma.

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:49.580
I can see

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:51.540
that your eyes are wet.

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:55.620
Your lips are dry too.

00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:56.470
Is that so?

00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.350
I think that's a sign

00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:00.580
of kidney damage.

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:01.220
What?

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:02.390
Kidney damage?

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:06.180
But it's fine.

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:07.180
Experts said

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:08.346
that it would gradually recover

00:38:08.368 --> 00:38:10.302
as long as you drink water
every half an hour.

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:11.580
I'll remind you.

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:15.220
Mr. Ma, it's time.

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:15.990
Time to drink.

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:22.540
That's about it.

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:31.990
Mr. Ma,

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:33.060
stop playing.

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:40.430
Mr. Ma,

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:41.500
time to drink.

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:42.500
I'll drink it myself.

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:03.870
Huang,

00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:06.140
do you need any help

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:07.620
with Zhongdian Web Fiction?

00:39:13.857 --> 00:39:15.470
The works published by these authors

00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:16.750
aren't very popular.

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:18.140
They feel dejected.

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:19.470
Help me encourage them

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:20.950
and cheer them up. Thanks.

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:25.830
Encourage them, huh?

00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:47.540
Are you working? How's it going?

00:39:49.657 --> 00:39:51.990
I've been joining Zhongdian Web Fiction
for quite some time,

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:54.430
but my posts barely get any views,
usually just single digits.

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.060
I feel like giving up.

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:01.020
Just give up, then.

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:03.700
You've been writing for some time,

00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:05.430
and they barely get any views.

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:06.680
And, you're upset about it too.

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:09.470
Say, could it be that this job
isn't meant for you?

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:15.950
But I write for a living.

00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:16.990
What else can I do?

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:20.990
You could start doing self-media.

00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:22.910
Since you like to write stuff,

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:24.180
you can write scripts,

or even make vlogs.

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:27.390
I think that'll prove to be
a better prospect for you.

00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:29.220
If you get famous,

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:30.540
you'll have your own IP.

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:43.660
Vlog?

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:53.140
Mr. Pei,

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:56.220
should I continue with
the management trainee program?

00:40:56.830 --> 00:40:58.750
I've been following your instructions,

00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:01.500
but I feel like
something's off about everyone.

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.310
They're all trying to avoid me.

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:04.620
What should I do?

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:05.430
Tang,

00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:07.020
it's been tough on you.

00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:07.950
You may cease

00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:09.830
your operation for now.

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:11.270
And, tell everyone

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:13.750
that the Four Wall Apartments
is ready for occupancy.

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:16.020
Alright, Mr. Pei.

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:21.180
Management trainee...

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:23.580
I wonder which genius came up with that.

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:25.430
Now, I can prevent any backstabbing,

00:41:25.435 --> 00:41:26.540
and I'll be compensated, too.

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:33.750
I have a 100-inch TV now.

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:36.660
I also own a house with
two rooms and one living room.

00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:39.950
The Four Wall Apartments
have lost so much money.

00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:45.540
I suppose the renovation
of Mingri Apartments

00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:47.060
is just around the corner.

Mr. Pei actually arranged

accommodations for us as well?

(Using Classical Poetry to Decode Internet Memes)
When we want to praise

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:11.520
something or someone,

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:13.820
we say 666 or "That's amazing".

00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:15.170
But we can also say...

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:18.180
I speak of the noble man,
gentle and warm, like polished jade.

00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:22.510
Ah, the worthy gentleman:
cut and shaped, filed and refined.

00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:24.789
Not for fame or profit
does he tread the road of honor;

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:26.940
his talent alone lifts him
to the celebratory heavens.

00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:28.330
If we feel happy,

00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:31.040
besides saying "I'm hyped"
or "This is unreal",

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:32.460
we can also say...

00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:34.568
When the great roc
rides the rising wind one day,

00:43:34.568 --> 00:43:36.350
it soars straight up,
ninety thousand miles away.

00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:38.524
With unbridled joy
and soaring thoughts we fly,

00:43:38.524 --> 00:43:40.540
longing to ascend the blue heavens,
gaze at the bright moon high.

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:42.500
I see the green hills rich
with grace and charm,

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:44.430
surely the hills, seeing me,
feel the same in turn.

00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:46.346
Head thrown back,
I laugh aloud and stride out the door,

00:43:46.346 --> 00:43:48.340

be mere weeds of the moor?

besides saying "emo"
and "in my feels",

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:53.580
we can also say...

00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:55.368
Delicate dice bear
red-bean marks within,

00:43:55.368 --> 00:43:56.860
such lovesickness,
carved to the bone, do you know it?

00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:58.724
All worldly affairs
are but a vast dream,

00:43:58.724 --> 00:44:00.720

does a lifetime endure?

and drink without restraint,

how gladly we journey home.

This feeling may one day
become a memory to recall,

00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:10.480
yet even then, it was already
steeped in confusion and regret.

00:44:10.635 --> 00:44:12.057
When we see beautiful views,

00:44:12.057 --> 00:44:13.100
besides saying "Unreal"

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:14.100
or "GOAT",

00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:16.130
or "This is stunning",

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:17.140
we can also say...

00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:20.160
Beauty beyond naming spreads,
pure radiance fills the river city.

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:21.924
Ten thousand acres of waves shimmer,
breaking the moonlight,

00:44:21.924 --> 00:44:23.970
a whole day of breeze and dew
carries the fragrance of lotus.

00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:25.657
The river flows
beyond heaven and earth,

00:44:25.657 --> 00:44:27.340
mountains appear
and vanish in mist and void.

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:28.746
My heart is as clear as flowing water,

00:44:28.746 --> 00:44:30.740
my body as light
as drifting white clouds.
