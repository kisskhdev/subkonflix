00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:15.787
The sun is so bright,
I can't open my eyes.

00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:18.957
When the humid air blows,

00:00:19.582 --> 00:00:21.584
it's hard to even breathe.

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.464
It's already November,
but today it feels as hot as midsummer.

00:00:28.299 --> 00:00:30.635
This unexpected heatwave

00:00:30.718 --> 00:00:33.763
is throwing off all of my senses.

00:00:36.307 --> 00:00:40.353
A season that I thought had already passed
has come back.

00:00:43.147 --> 00:00:44.274
You've changed.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.609
How?

00:00:48.152 --> 00:00:49.028
You look old.

00:00:52.448 --> 00:00:53.366
Oh?

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:54.409
Rin?

00:00:56.786 --> 00:00:57.704
Who's that?

00:01:00.748 --> 00:01:02.208
Nice to meet you.

00:01:02.292 --> 00:01:05.545
Mr. Hase and I were working together
with the catering.

00:01:05.628 --> 00:01:07.463
My name is Miyauchi Masumi.

00:01:19.601 --> 00:01:21.060
Why didn't you tell me?

00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:22.937
Well…

00:01:23.605 --> 00:01:24.814
Were you hiding it?

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.235
Of course not.
It wasn't important enough to bring up.

00:01:31.988 --> 00:01:35.533
Why wouldn't you turn down
a job offer from your ex-girlfriend?

00:01:35.617 --> 00:01:39.787
Like I said, it wasn't like that.
It was a coincidence.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.000
There's nothing to worry about.

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:48.254
Masumi and I… I mean…

00:01:48.338 --> 00:01:51.966
Ms. Miyauchi and I aren't the type
to hold onto feelings like that.

00:01:57.722 --> 00:02:00.475
This is unbelievable.

00:02:00.558 --> 00:02:01.434
What did you say?

00:02:05.563 --> 00:02:07.649
I just can't believe it.

00:02:07.732 --> 00:02:10.235
To me, it goes against common sense.

00:02:11.277 --> 00:02:14.239
And I think all my friends in Korea
would agree with me.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.661
Can we stop talking about that?

00:02:22.497 --> 00:02:24.290
You know it, don't you?

00:02:24.374 --> 00:02:27.085
Even if we argue over
what we think is common sense,

00:02:27.794 --> 00:02:30.004
it won't solve anything.

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:37.178
Rin.

00:02:38.137 --> 00:02:40.473
I didn't tell you about Ms. Miyauchi,

00:02:41.432 --> 00:02:42.392
and I'm sorry.

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:45.728
But

00:02:46.938 --> 00:02:50.400
the catering job gave me
a real sense of accomplishment.

00:02:52.652 --> 00:02:54.320
They might even introduce me to--

00:02:54.404 --> 00:02:56.447
I want to support your job.

00:02:56.531 --> 00:02:57.365
But…

00:02:59.742 --> 00:03:03.121
where is your courtesy as my boyfriend?

00:03:07.667 --> 00:03:12.046
Not to mention, an "ex-girlfriend"
is someone you fell in love with once.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.840
You can always fall in love again.

00:03:13.923 --> 00:03:15.550
- That will never happen.
- Why?

00:03:15.633 --> 00:03:16.926
Because I have you.

00:03:29.313 --> 00:03:31.232
I was able to become serious about cooking

00:03:32.692 --> 00:03:35.320
and was motivated
to take on the challenge of catering,

00:03:36.487 --> 00:03:38.698
all because of you.

00:03:43.244 --> 00:03:46.205
Just as you are working hard at animation,

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:47.540
right now,

00:03:48.624 --> 00:03:51.127
I want to give my very best to my cooking.

00:03:56.466 --> 00:03:57.508
Okay.

00:03:58.801 --> 00:04:01.220
But I want to lay down some rules.

00:04:02.597 --> 00:04:05.433
I don't want you two to meet up alone.

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:08.644
And I don't want you to contact her
if it's not about work.

00:04:13.274 --> 00:04:14.525
I promise.

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:18.696
I will never do anything
that you wouldn't want me to do.

00:04:29.582 --> 00:04:30.708
Thank you.

00:04:37.382 --> 00:04:41.677
I know that asking him to turn down a job
for my sake is unreasonable.

00:04:44.764 --> 00:04:46.140
I understand that in my head,

00:04:46.724 --> 00:04:49.102
but not in my heart.

00:04:50.937 --> 00:04:52.063
Sorry for the wait.

00:04:53.731 --> 00:04:56.567
- Here.
- Thanks.

00:04:58.361 --> 00:05:00.822
They also had this.

00:05:02.365 --> 00:05:05.034
{\an8}Oh, wow! I can't wait.

00:05:05.618 --> 00:05:06.452
Me too.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.044
I think I should talk to him about it,
after all.

00:05:15.628 --> 00:05:17.380
I'm sure Taiga will understand.

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:22.176
Are you okay?

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.678
I stepped on something.

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:26.305
Let me take a look.

00:05:30.101 --> 00:05:32.145
It doesn't look like you're hurt anywhere.

00:05:33.938 --> 00:05:35.106
Park Rin.

00:05:36.274 --> 00:05:39.527
What if you ruin the mood by complaining?

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:41.612
That's right.

00:05:41.696 --> 00:05:45.366
Sometimes you need to suck it up
and compromise a little.

00:05:46.993 --> 00:05:49.495
Let's make this a fun trip.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.206
- Let's.
- All right.

00:07:08.491 --> 00:07:10.117
It looks like a miniature town.

00:07:20.253 --> 00:07:23.506
Taiga? Are you afraid of heights?

00:07:24.882 --> 00:07:26.217
Not really.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:29.470
You're scared, aren't you?

00:07:29.971 --> 00:07:31.305
I'm not scared.

00:07:45.361 --> 00:07:46.779
That's what I'm talking about.

00:07:46.862 --> 00:07:48.781
I guess you haven't changed in that sense.

00:07:48.864 --> 00:07:51.158
Oh please. We're the same.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:02.420
Thanks for waiting.

00:08:07.675 --> 00:08:10.386
It's from Shige. Sorry, can I take this?

00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:15.308
Hello.

00:08:16.142 --> 00:08:19.061
Yes. It's hot today, isn't it?

00:08:24.859 --> 00:08:25.901
This is good.

00:08:26.736 --> 00:08:28.279
It goes well with this view.

00:08:31.198 --> 00:08:34.785
Thank you for bringing me to such
a beautiful place.

00:08:37.955 --> 00:08:42.418
I'm happy to be able to come here
with you.

00:08:44.754 --> 00:08:46.005
Me too.

00:08:46.714 --> 00:08:48.633
I'm glad I got to come here with you.

00:09:18.954 --> 00:09:19.830
{\an8}Amazing…

00:09:19.914 --> 00:09:20.748
{\an8}‪WEEKLY SQUAT

00:09:47.983 --> 00:09:49.985
A lot of people
get the wrong idea about it,

00:09:50.069 --> 00:09:52.279
so I'm glad you showed interest.

00:09:52.363 --> 00:09:53.447
Oh, it's nothing.

00:09:53.531 --> 00:09:55.866
- If I hear of anything, I'll let you know.
- Thank you.

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:57.827
You'd better be grateful.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:58.744
Thank you!

00:10:03.791 --> 00:10:05.084
I'll get going then.

00:10:05.167 --> 00:10:06.919
- Okay.
- See you.

00:10:07.628 --> 00:10:08.629
Thank you!

00:10:11.799 --> 00:10:14.093
I had no luck
with three machines in a row,

00:10:14.176 --> 00:10:16.178
but I'm finally getting back on track.

00:10:16.929 --> 00:10:19.265
Before I forget… I got your favorite.

00:10:19.932 --> 00:10:22.435
- Strawberry chocolate.
- Thanks.

00:10:23.102 --> 00:10:26.188
Who were those people?
I've never seen them here before.

00:10:30.151 --> 00:10:33.821
They're basically… my business partners.

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.824
What are you saying?

00:10:37.491 --> 00:10:41.287
I may not look it, but I'm actually
thinking about things, all right?

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:43.122
Just trust me.

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:57.970
This is a torii?

00:11:02.099 --> 00:11:04.643
I WANT TO MEET MY SOULMATE

00:11:04.727 --> 00:11:06.812
You write your wish here, huh?

00:11:11.567 --> 00:11:13.736
Since we're here,
why don't you write something too?

00:11:15.446 --> 00:11:16.906
Maybe I will.

00:11:21.744 --> 00:11:23.621
I WANT MY EX-GIRLFRIEND BACK

00:11:23.704 --> 00:11:25.498
PLEASE REKINDLE OUR RELATIONSHIP

00:11:30.711 --> 00:11:31.545
Rin?

00:11:34.465 --> 00:11:37.051
We don't have time, so let's go.

00:11:55.694 --> 00:11:57.780
You don't seem to have energy.

00:11:58.322 --> 00:11:59.657
Are you not feeling well?

00:12:00.824 --> 00:12:03.827
Sorry… But I'm feeling just fine.

00:12:09.625 --> 00:12:10.960
It's Yung-yeol.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.296
Hello?

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.882
Park Rin. Did you see my message?

00:12:18.217 --> 00:12:21.512
Oh, about your souvenir?
I'll check right now.

00:12:23.681 --> 00:12:25.182
What is this?

00:12:25.266 --> 00:12:29.061
Local sake from Izu and pickled wasabi?

00:12:29.979 --> 00:12:33.440
Rin. Maybe you shouldn't
talk on the phone while on the bus.

00:12:36.235 --> 00:12:37.528
Sorry.

00:12:39.488 --> 00:12:41.490
Sorry. I'll call you back later.

00:13:24.867 --> 00:13:26.368
Thank you for waiting.

00:13:26.452 --> 00:13:29.246
Here's your creamy lemon pasta
with salmon and mushroom

00:13:29.872 --> 00:13:32.333
and roasted pork with beet sauce.

00:13:32.416 --> 00:13:34.752
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:13:35.753 --> 00:13:37.046
Enjoy.

00:13:39.173 --> 00:13:40.257
All right.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:49.391
What's wrong?

00:13:51.393 --> 00:13:54.438
I ordered roast beef,

00:13:55.105 --> 00:13:56.148
but this is…

00:13:57.566 --> 00:14:01.278
roasted pork with beet sauce.

00:14:07.993 --> 00:14:09.161
You're right…

00:14:12.539 --> 00:14:13.415
Excuse me.

00:14:14.541 --> 00:14:16.168
I'll eat that then.

00:14:17.836 --> 00:14:21.715
You were interested
in the creamy pasta too, so we can swap.

00:14:22.383 --> 00:14:23.384
This is…

00:14:24.843 --> 00:14:26.595
the restaurant's mistake, right?

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.057
Yeah, it is, but…

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.726
Since I work at Tanomi,

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:35.437
I don't like making a fuss
in these situations.

00:14:37.022 --> 00:14:39.525
I know that everyone makes mistakes.

00:14:40.401 --> 00:14:42.778
But wouldn't it be better
to let them know?

00:14:45.656 --> 00:14:48.075
But I'll eat it, so isn't that fine?

00:14:56.792 --> 00:14:58.293
So basically,

00:14:59.795 --> 00:15:01.630
I'm in the wrong again, huh?

00:15:02.256 --> 00:15:03.257
I didn't say that--

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:07.219
You said that we shouldn't
argue about our cultural differences,

00:15:07.302 --> 00:15:09.013
but if we don't acknowledge that,

00:15:09.596 --> 00:15:12.016
I'll look like a bad person
who does everything wrong.

00:15:20.024 --> 00:15:24.570
That makes me more sad.

00:16:20.876 --> 00:16:22.127
They don't have it.

00:16:42.231 --> 00:16:43.774
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

00:16:44.441 --> 00:16:46.401
Do you have ramune?

00:16:47.236 --> 00:16:49.071
I'm sorry, we don't have that.

00:16:53.492 --> 00:16:54.785
They don't have it…

00:17:13.637 --> 00:17:15.973
STUDIO JUPITET

00:17:16.056 --> 00:17:17.975

Trust your mother, okay?

00:17:31.947 --> 00:17:34.074
- The art instructor position?
- Yes.

00:17:34.158 --> 00:17:36.910
You have no other options, right?

00:17:36.994 --> 00:17:37.995

HOW TO MAKE UP FAST

00:18:14.364 --> 00:18:16.909
- Welcome back.
- Hey.

00:18:24.166 --> 00:18:25.125
Are you going to sleep already?

00:18:27.294 --> 00:18:28.629
I'm a little tired.

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:33.133
Okay. It was a long day, after all.

00:18:35.969 --> 00:18:37.346
Good night.

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:39.431
Good night.

00:19:18.095 --> 00:19:19.680
{\an8}TANOMI

00:19:19.763 --> 00:19:21.723
{\an8}What? Where's Mr. Hase today?

00:19:21.807 --> 00:19:25.185
Oh, he took today and tomorrow off.

00:19:26.812 --> 00:19:28.397
He's on a trip with his girlfriend.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.650
Oh, a trip? How nice.

00:19:31.733 --> 00:19:34.778
It's Rin's something-list.

00:19:35.279 --> 00:19:37.322
- Bucket list.
- Yeah, that.

00:19:37.406 --> 00:19:40.784
One of the items on her list of things
to do before she dies

00:19:40.867 --> 00:19:42.536
was to drink ramune at a hot spring.

00:19:42.619 --> 00:19:46.498
What? Mr. Hase is such a nice boyfriend!

00:19:48.917 --> 00:19:49.793
Here.

00:19:50.877 --> 00:19:54.715
Noa, do you have anything you want to do
before you die?

00:19:54.798 --> 00:19:55.632
‪What?

00:20:01.138 --> 00:20:02.764
I've never thought about it.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.978
I got a lot of good feedback on this.

00:20:08.562 --> 00:20:12.274
{\an8}As soon as I posted it on our social media
I got reservations from foreigners.

00:20:12.357 --> 00:20:13.525
‪Oh!

00:20:14.443 --> 00:20:15.902
Really?

00:20:16.486 --> 00:20:18.947
If I update the menu, can I ask you again?

00:20:19.531 --> 00:20:23.076
Sure. It didn't take long anyway.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.161
Okay.

00:20:26.413 --> 00:20:28.707
A bucket list, huh?

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:31.918
But I've already done everything
that I've wanted to do.

00:20:32.002 --> 00:20:33.754
As expected.

00:20:34.671 --> 00:20:35.797
I would rather

00:20:35.881 --> 00:20:39.885
list all the things that I regret,
and remove each one.

00:20:40.677 --> 00:20:43.764
Then what is your number one regret?

00:20:44.723 --> 00:20:46.308
I should've divorced earlier.

00:20:48.101 --> 00:20:49.603
I see.

00:20:50.687 --> 00:20:51.938
What about you?

00:20:52.022 --> 00:20:54.483
If you could go back in time just once,

00:20:54.566 --> 00:20:58.362
and remove just one regret off your list,
what would you do?

00:21:00.405 --> 00:21:02.949
Let's see…

00:21:06.745 --> 00:21:07.662
I think

00:21:08.663 --> 00:21:12.376
you should hurry up and move on
to the next chapter of your life.

00:21:17.839 --> 00:21:20.050
Taiga, what do you want to do?

00:21:21.385 --> 00:21:23.762
I can't make a decision that easily.

00:21:24.554 --> 00:21:27.432
I've dedicated
more than half of my life to track.

00:21:28.392 --> 00:21:31.353
But in the end, you'll spend most
of your life not doing track.

00:21:32.062 --> 00:21:35.857
You have to plan for your life
after graduation.

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.490
You wouldn't understand, Masumi.

00:21:55.127 --> 00:21:58.839
I guess my biggest regret

00:21:59.756 --> 00:22:03.051
is that I hurt my ex-boyfriend.

00:22:04.553 --> 00:22:06.304
I contradicted myself.

00:22:07.305 --> 00:22:08.890
At first, I liked him

00:22:08.974 --> 00:22:12.561
because he was so unbelievably
determined to chase his dream.

00:22:13.895 --> 00:22:17.566
But in the end, I broke up with him
because "he wouldn't face reality."

00:22:20.318 --> 00:22:23.071
Do you still have feelings for him,

00:22:23.989 --> 00:22:28.118
or do you just feel regretful
that you couldn't be kind?

00:22:57.606 --> 00:22:59.149
{\an8}TAIGA, HOW IS IT GOING?

00:22:59.232 --> 00:23:01.484
{\an8}IF YOU'RE IN NUMAZU,
I RECOMMEND THIS SPOT.

00:23:04.279 --> 00:23:05.363
Excuse me.

00:23:07.115 --> 00:23:08.283
Go ahead.

00:23:43.026 --> 00:23:46.196
They're really… amazing.

00:23:47.822 --> 00:23:50.951
Their themes and motifs are all so unique.

00:23:51.034 --> 00:23:52.077
It's so entertaining.

00:23:53.411 --> 00:23:55.330
Is that right?

00:24:00.168 --> 00:24:01.544
That reminds me…

00:24:02.545 --> 00:24:06.174
If you had an infinite amount
of time and money,

00:24:06.758 --> 00:24:08.301
what would you like to create?

00:24:14.641 --> 00:24:19.062
What is the message
you want to convey through this piece?

00:24:23.566 --> 00:24:24.484
Rin?

00:24:27.737 --> 00:24:28.655
Are you okay?

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:35.412
Sorry… I need to go to the bathroom.

00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:56.975
Thanks for waiting.

00:25:01.646 --> 00:25:02.522
Rin.

00:25:04.107 --> 00:25:05.066
Look at this.

00:25:10.739 --> 00:25:12.699
You haven't been smiling at all.

00:25:13.199 --> 00:25:14.284
Have you noticed?

00:25:20.498 --> 00:25:23.043
If this is how it's going to be
until the end of the trip

00:25:24.377 --> 00:25:26.004
we can't enjoy it.

00:25:31.092 --> 00:25:34.262
What are you thinking right now?

00:25:37.098 --> 00:25:38.892
Whatever it is, just tell me.

00:25:59.913 --> 00:26:00.872
What's wrong?

00:26:01.998 --> 00:26:03.249
{\an8}TAIGA, HOW IS IT GOING?

00:26:03.333 --> 00:26:04.876
{\an8}IF YOU'RE IN NUMAZU,
I RECOMMEND THIS SPOT.

00:26:04.959 --> 00:26:06.169
{\an8}This is…

00:26:07.045 --> 00:26:09.047
not about work, is it?

00:26:11.424 --> 00:26:13.885
No, look at the rest of it.

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:16.721
She's just researching things
for catering--

00:26:16.805 --> 00:26:20.058
It's impossible to differentiate
between what's work and what's not.

00:26:20.683 --> 00:26:22.185
Even if it's about work,

00:26:22.268 --> 00:26:24.854
why would she message you
while you're on vacation?

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:28.650
I get it.
Let's go back to the inn for now.

00:26:32.487 --> 00:26:33.446
Rin.

00:26:35.073 --> 00:26:36.408
Taiga,

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:40.912
you care more about what others think
than how I feel, even at a time like this.

00:26:40.995 --> 00:26:43.665
That's not true.

00:26:43.748 --> 00:26:47.544
More like, I thought we settled
the issue about Ms. Miyauchi.

00:26:47.627 --> 00:26:51.631
But when things like this happen,
I can't help but worry.

00:26:52.132 --> 00:26:53.633
Try to understand my feelings--

00:26:53.716 --> 00:26:55.677
Come on, already.

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:02.600
Am I that untrustworthy to you?

00:27:05.979 --> 00:27:06.813
Well,

00:27:06.896 --> 00:27:08.690
try to have some trust in him.

00:27:11.025 --> 00:27:14.279
One day, Aki will find honest work.

00:27:16.573 --> 00:27:18.074
I wonder.

00:27:19.451 --> 00:27:22.245
Apparently, he is thinking about it,
but who knows…

00:27:24.289 --> 00:27:25.165
Oh?

00:27:25.248 --> 00:27:26.332
Hyeongnim!

00:27:27.208 --> 00:27:28.293
Dongsaeng!

00:27:29.794 --> 00:27:33.006
The bond between brothers
is incredible, isn't it?

00:27:33.506 --> 00:27:35.675
So, what were you talking about?

00:27:54.944 --> 00:27:55.945
Noa…

00:27:58.656 --> 00:28:01.159
felt that way about me, huh?

00:28:04.954 --> 00:28:07.916
I'm so pathetic.

00:28:08.708 --> 00:28:10.668
That's not true, Aki.

00:28:12.212 --> 00:28:13.171
But I…

00:28:15.131 --> 00:28:17.550
love Noa.

00:28:18.801 --> 00:28:20.762
The love I have for her in my heart

00:28:21.513 --> 00:28:24.015
is stronger than anybody else
and I know it.

00:28:25.808 --> 00:28:26.809
I understand.

00:28:28.436 --> 00:28:30.438
It's all about the heart.

00:28:31.731 --> 00:28:34.067
As long as you have love,
it will work out.

00:28:36.069 --> 00:28:38.863
I am on your side, until I die.

00:28:43.243 --> 00:28:44.494
Hyeongnim…

00:28:50.458 --> 00:28:51.334
Dongsaeng.

00:28:56.589 --> 00:28:58.341
Hyeongnim!

00:29:40.842 --> 00:29:41.718
Rin?

00:29:49.684 --> 00:29:53.563
{\an8}UNFORTUNATELY, WE WILL NOT BE ACCEPTING
YOUR APPLICATION AT THIS TIME.

00:30:14.125 --> 00:30:17.754
You can try again.

00:30:22.383 --> 00:30:23.593
Again?

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:25.553
When?

00:30:30.099 --> 00:30:32.894
This was my last chance

00:30:34.479 --> 00:30:36.230
to prove to eomma…

00:30:40.985 --> 00:30:43.947
Prove what to your mother?

00:30:51.829 --> 00:30:55.750
She has been telling me to work
as an instructor in Korea

00:30:56.292 --> 00:30:57.710
after I graduate.

00:31:00.004 --> 00:31:04.384
I thought that I could prove myself
to eomma if I got into a studio.

00:31:12.642 --> 00:31:14.686
Why didn't you tell me any of this?

00:31:17.063 --> 00:31:18.856
Because you…

00:31:19.857 --> 00:31:22.735
are moving forward, one step at a time.

00:31:23.653 --> 00:31:27.907
While I don't even know
what I want to create.

00:31:29.575 --> 00:31:31.285
I was too ashamed.

00:31:33.871 --> 00:31:35.581
It's nothing to be ashamed about.

00:31:39.043 --> 00:31:40.378
But Rin…

00:31:42.088 --> 00:31:45.925
You said it was to prove yourself
to your mother, right?

00:31:48.219 --> 00:31:49.595
I don't know,

00:31:50.179 --> 00:31:54.559
but I feel like
that shouldn't be your goal.

00:32:09.073 --> 00:32:12.118
What do you want to do?

00:32:19.709 --> 00:32:21.002
I don't know.

00:32:23.921 --> 00:32:26.382
I want to become an animator,

00:32:26.466 --> 00:32:28.509
but nothing is working out.

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:34.682
But I don't want to give up
and go back to Korea either.

00:32:36.142 --> 00:32:39.312
I want to believe in my talent
and challenge myself.

00:32:41.314 --> 00:32:42.690
But nothing is working…

00:32:59.582 --> 00:33:03.127
Taiga, what about you?

00:33:05.296 --> 00:33:06.130
‪What?

00:33:09.175 --> 00:33:11.844
Where is our relationship headed?

00:33:25.858 --> 00:33:27.318
In the end…

00:33:30.947 --> 00:33:32.657
it's your choice.

00:33:39.247 --> 00:33:43.501
I want to respect your decision the most.

00:33:55.179 --> 00:33:56.931
You're fine with that, Taiga?

00:33:59.100 --> 00:33:59.934
‪What?

00:34:01.144 --> 00:34:02.687
Why are you like that?

00:34:04.355 --> 00:34:07.859
Just think about it.

00:34:08.609 --> 00:34:10.069
If, let's say,

00:34:11.612 --> 00:34:14.282
you decided to go back to Korea…

00:34:16.826 --> 00:34:18.578
I don't have any right to stop you.

00:34:19.537 --> 00:34:20.705
Isn't that right?

00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:30.548
Then how can you

00:34:33.259 --> 00:34:35.219
call yourself my boyfriend?

00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:40.224
What do you mean?

00:34:41.309 --> 00:34:43.060
Don't you understand?

00:34:43.644 --> 00:34:46.522
All I wanted was for you to say

00:34:46.606 --> 00:34:48.441
that I belonged here.

00:34:48.524 --> 00:34:50.443
That I could stay here.

00:34:56.449 --> 00:34:59.493
I wish you would've accepted me,
even just for a second.

00:35:03.331 --> 00:35:05.208
Why don't you get it?

00:35:13.883 --> 00:35:17.094
Sorry. I can't keep up with you.

00:35:19.055 --> 00:35:20.681
It's too difficult for me.

00:35:29.565 --> 00:35:30.608
I can't anymore…

00:35:33.027 --> 00:35:34.070
Let's break up.

00:37:28.184 --> 00:37:32.104
The reason we broke up
was not because of his ex-girlfriend,

00:37:34.065 --> 00:37:38.402
nor because of our upbringing,
personalities, or timing.

00:37:45.201 --> 00:37:48.537
In the end, our will wasn't strong enough.

00:37:49.455 --> 00:37:53.000
Our will to stay with each other
until the end, no matter what.

00:38:19.985 --> 00:38:22.154
If I had gone back to Taiga at that time…

00:38:24.573 --> 00:38:28.994
I wonder if things
would have been different for us?

00:38:33.582 --> 00:38:35.376
- Welcome.
- Good work.

00:38:36.001 --> 00:38:37.002
I like you.

00:38:37.086 --> 00:38:38.295
PREVIEW

00:38:39.046 --> 00:38:41.215
{\an8}Don't come near her ever again.

00:38:41.298 --> 00:38:42.967
{\an8}THIS DRAMA IS FICTION AND ALL CHARACTERS
AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE FICTIONAL
