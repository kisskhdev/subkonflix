00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.930
[How dare you!?]

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.920
[Episode 23]

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.280
Lord Chen.

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.000
Please.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.789
Lord Chen.

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.640
Good morning, Lord Chen.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.039
Hello.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.590
So many new faces around.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.400
Indeed. We thought
when the Empress Dowager fell,

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.460
we'd be in trouble.

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.710
But unexpectedly,
we've risen to prominence.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.570
Now we're riding high on success.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.130
I haven't been sleeping well these days,

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.000
afraid

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.950
it's all just a fleeting dream.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:03.310
Lord Chen.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.560
Don't you get it yet?

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.240
We thought Prince Duan was formidable,

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.590
but now we realize

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.280
the more ruthless one

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:11.600
is above him.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.080
Lord Chen is right.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.000
Who gets promoted
and who loses their life—

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.590
it's all within

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.360
the Emperor's control.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.460
Do you think

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.280
His Majesty will seek to

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.910
settle scores with us later?

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.310
What scores would there be?

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.970
The Emperor
and the Empress Dowager are family.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.160
All these years, we've diligently

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.910
served His Majesty.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.590
If anyone would have scores to be settled,

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.520
it should be

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.880
the other faction's.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.710
Did you see that?

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.600
They avoid us like the plague.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.960
A bunch of opportunists.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.460
His Highness hasn't summoned us for days.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.760
What should we do?

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.970
We're completely in the dark.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.220
It's better not to be summoned.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.830
His Majesty is displeased with us now.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.350
This is for our protection.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.740
That's not right.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.960
I saw Lord Mu
enter the Emperor's residence yesterday.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.110
His Majesty arrives!

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.740
Long live Your Majesty!

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.120
Rise, all of you.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.280
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:39.750
Where is Lord Mu?

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.430
Your Majesty,

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:44.970
I am here.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.100
The personnel evaluation records

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.930
of the Ministry of Personnel

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.750
that I ordered you to submit—
why aren't they completed yet?

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.550
Your Majesty,

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.570
over the past decade,

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.120
the changes in the court officials
have been complex.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.070
The recording work
is enormous and tedious.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.720
It cannot be completed overnight.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.030
I humbly request Your Majesty

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.750
to grant me a few more days.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.070
These personnel evaluations

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.870
should be organized annually.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.000
Isn't tracking changes

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.480
a simple matter?

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.779
Look at our Ministry of Revenue.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:18.250
The changes we have to track

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.170
are the changes in land and population
across the country.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.570
The workload is hundreds of times greater,

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.800
yet we still completed it.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.090
That's right.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.140
Indeed.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.570
Exactly.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.460
Your Majesty,

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.780
recently, there have been
frequent personnel changes in court.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:35.980
In my ministry alone,

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.490
including the Left Vice Minister,

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.490
we are short five officials.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.820
I have been searching for

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.500
suitable candidates
to fill these positions.

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:48.150
But unfortunately...

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.260
Your Majesty.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.150
I do not agree

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:56.409
with

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.310
Lord Mu.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.050
If we're talking about

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.170
having difficulty looking for candidates,

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.020
it's obvious that the Ministry of War

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.710
has it the most difficult.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.840
Although the court
has suffered serious losses recently,

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.700
many talented
young officials have emerged.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:15.730
Lord Mu,

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.130
why not promote them?

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.670
Lord Mu, you mustn't
let your personal feelings interfere.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.610
Your Majesty, you are wise!

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.780
I... I would never dare do such a thing!

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.850
My ministers, you all make valid points.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:30.980
I can understand

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.060
Lord Mu's difficulties too.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.830
But this matter must be resolved.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:37.790
How about this?

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.200
Is there anyone willing to volunteer

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.450
to help Lord Mu with this urgent matter?

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:49.360
I,

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:50.940
Yang Duojie!

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.570
Am willing to help Lord Mu.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.700
Isn't this Lord Yang
from the Imperial Astronomer's office?

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.050
The Imperial Astronomer's office

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.780
has nothing to do
with the Ministry of Personnel.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.850
Your Majesty...

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.050
Is this appropriate?

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.020
Since I joined
the Imperial Astronomer's office,

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.290
I've calculated calendars,

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.730
established seasonal divisions,

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.100
observed celestial phenomena,

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.290
and divined fortunes.

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:18.310
All these duties

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.830
require coordination and cooperation

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.020
with various ministries

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.650
and attention to every detail.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.120
Therefore,

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.810
I think I am

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.450
the best candidate

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:34.840
to extend help

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.490
to Lord Mu.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.370
Lord Yang previously saved us
at Mount Bei,

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.420
and now takes the initiative to help
the Ministry of Personnel—

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.010
he is truly a talented young official!

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.080
If my Ministry of Revenue
weren't running so smoothly,

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.180
I would want to ask Lord Mu

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:56.800
to transfer him to me.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:06:59.610
Indeed!

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.160
I second that.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.180
-I also agree.
-I also agree.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:05.960
If that's the case,

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.840
I promote Yang Duojie
to Vice Minister of Personnel

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.970
to quickly compile the records I need.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:16.550
As for Lord Mu...

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:18.810
Your Majesty.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:21.020
You've been overworked lately.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.100
You should rest

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:23.410
at home for now.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:46.560
Your Highness.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:48.210
By all accounts,

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:51.580
I'm openly aligned
with the Empress Dowager's faction.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.400
Yet he not only
doesn't try to win me over,

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.780
but puts me on the hot seat repeatedly.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:59.460
I've been thinking hard,

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:02.450
but I don't think
I've shown any flaw anywhere.

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.290
Please understand, Your Highness.

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.170
Lord Mu, you misunderstand.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.210
I don't mean to blame you.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.490
This is just like
the recent failure at Mount Bei.

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:14.540
We know for sure

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.450
the strategy was sound,

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.160
but there were just
some unexpected variables.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:24.410
Variables?

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:26.710
The first one

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:29.850
is the strange firearms they possess.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.630
Its destructive power is terrifying.

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:33.570
The other one is

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:37.600
that the expert we met
on the pleasure boat

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.169
is not dead.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.500
Noble Consort Yu deceived us?

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.610
Even if she deceived us,

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.660
if no one had tipped them off

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.710
and handed over our undercover agents,

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:04.040
along with Lord Murong,

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:05.920
as gifts of surrender,

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:08.290
I believe the Emperor

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:11.290
wouldn't have made it down
Mount Bei alive.

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:15.570
The one who knew
the entire assassination plan

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:19.110
and was aware
of all the personnel involved...

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:22.670
It's Consort Xie!

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.300
That wretched woman...

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.120
Hot pot?

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.000
Two soup bases too!

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:40.600
We've been waiting for you.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.400
Come sit down.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.840
If I'd known you lived like this,

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.650
I would've switched factions long ago.

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:47.160
It's not too late now.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.370
After we finish eating,

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:49.770
let's play some mahjong.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:51.950
You know what?

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:53.420
Rumors are spreading among the people

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:53.850
saying

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.030
I harmed the Empress Dowager.

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:57.290
And that thunderstorm

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.100
was divine punishment
for my misconduct as ruler.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:01.840
Eat this.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.220
This is clearly a rumor
spread by Prince Duan's faction.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.550
Prince Duan values
having a legitimate cause.

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:08.420
Those rumors

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:11.480
are all groundwork
for his future rebellion.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:14.950
Put it in the spicy soup base?

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:18.400
But the problem is
we can't prove our innocence either.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:20.730
Who's spreading these rumors?

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:21.730
I'll go kill one of them

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:22.830
as a warning.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:23.960
No!

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:25.010
Why not?

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.670
Suppression will only backfire.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.220
What should we do then?

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.200
Fight evil with evil!

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:32.340
Evil?

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.870
Which sect is it from?

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:37.480
I've never heard of it.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:40.820
I'm from the Devil's Castle.

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:44.040
Anyway,

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:46.390
if Prince Duan calls you a tyrant,

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.050
you call him a hypocrite.

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:49.700
If he says you harmed the Empress Dowager,

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.060
you say he hired assassins.

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.370
If he says you were struck by lightning,

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:55.180
you say as the true Son of Heaven,

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.490
you can summon 81 thunderbolts
with a wave of your hand

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.820
to strike down on all the other assassins.

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.300
Isn't that too exaggerated?

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.050
Seems quite dramatic too.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.280
What do you two know?

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:08.050
Let me put it this way.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.060
If you excitedly share
with other people this:

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.340
"Jeez!

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.810
I learned something from a book today."

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:18.330
Would you be sharing about things

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:20.840
like the Pythagorean theorem, functions,

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:23.100
prime numbers,
or that pi equals 3.1415926?

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:23.980
Of course not!

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.110
Because you can't even remember that.

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:26.580
But

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:29.290
if you go tell others,

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:31.250
"Oh my God.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.420
That tyrant

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:33.980
just waved his arm

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.220
and summoned 100,000 thunderbolts,

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:37.520
killing all the

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:39.280
darn assassins."

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.790
Would you go around telling others that?

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:47.010
That makes some sense.

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:49.630
Throughout history, Emperors,

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:51.020
to win people's hearts,

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:54.940
would even make up stories
about hiding books in fish bellies.

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.840
The key is that
people actually believed them.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.010
Not bad, Xie.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.400
You've got skills.

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:01.710
Prince Duan has lasted this long

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:03.310
all because of your support.

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:06.580
Him?

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:08.700
That bastard.

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:10.760
He's no fun to play with.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:11.760
I'm done with him.

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:13.980
But

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:15.520
I must warn you.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:18.650
Public opinion battles
are just the first wave.

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:20.250
The real attacks come after.

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:21.680
You better be careful.

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:23.760
He wants legitimate reasons.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.890
He won't make a move inside the palace.

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:27.810
That's right.

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:29.150
Xu Yao's book also says

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.300
he'll only make his move
when you leave the palace.

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:37.610
I've been meaning to ask you.

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:39.970
You mentioned before

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.700
that the plan in Xu Yao's book

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.860
was different from my original plan.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:45.630
How did you know that?

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:47.920
I only told Xiahou Bo.

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:57.220
After Xu Yao switched sides,

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.420
he told me everything.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:12:59.820
He discussed all the suggestions you made

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.220
with Prince Duan before.

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:04.540
That makes sense now.

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:10.580
I got it!

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:11.580
What?

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:12.770
What's wrong, Mr. Bei?

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:13.700
What did you get?

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:14.370
Evil!

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.690
Braised egg.

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:33.020
I didn't get that right.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:34.430
Let me go again.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:38.050
Living in ancient times,

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.820
not having a bathroom heater is fine.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.060
But not having a hair dryer,

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.460
that's the real trouble.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.950
Who told you to bathe every day?

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:51.360
After hot pot, I smell all over.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.220
How can I sleep?

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:56.740
That's true.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:13:59.940
You smell so nice.

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:01.790
What are you doing?

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.490
Let me go.

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:04.250
No.

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:06.300
If you keep fooling around,

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.900
I'll make you take medicine.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:08.870
Why take medicine?

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:09.700
I'm not sick.

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:11.380
Quick!

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:12.730
Let go—

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:14.930
Quick!

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:20.340
Mr. Bei.

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:21.330
What is it?

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:22.340
Dan.

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:24.280
Li Yunxi delivered a letter.

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:41.420
What does it say?

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.800
Cen Jintian's condition has worsened.

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:49.210
He might not make it through this winter.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:53.480
[For the Emperor's personal attention:
Cen Jintian's health is deteriorating.]

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:54.540
[I'm afraid he can't make it
through winter. He has compiled]

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.020
[the planting of Yan millet in a manual.]

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:55.450
How could this be?

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:56.390
[He hopes Your Majesty can go
see him one last time.]

00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:58.030
In the original story,

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.390
he at least survived until the drought.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.300
How did it push forward by so much?

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:04.320
That's because

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.120
he was hanging on

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:09.330
hoping to see the harvest.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:13.700
Now he knows the people
will survive the drought,

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:16.260
he has nothing to worry about anymore.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.350
For him,

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.130
it's a satisfying ending.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.700
How can this be considered
a happy ending?

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.460
We clearly promised him before

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:27.240
that he would live to see

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:29.740
peace and prosperity throughout the land.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:30.940
But you know,

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:34.270
when we used those words
to gain his loyalty,

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:36.530
there probably wasn't enough time.

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:38.640
That vision...

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.040
can only remain a vision.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:48.790
He says

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:51.050
he wants to see you one more time.

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:53.900
I can't leave the palace now.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:54.700
I know.

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:56.690
-So I can—
-You can't.

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:57.620
Why not?

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.160
It's too dangerous out there now.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:04.370
Prince Duan's spies are everywhere.

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:05.700
I'll be careful.

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:07.860
And I have secret guards to protect me.

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:09.330
We lost so many men

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:10.600
at Mount Bei.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:12.630
These are all we have left.

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:14.080
And some must be sent

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.430
to protect Xie Yong'er.

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:19.100
What about Wang Zhao's funeral?

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.960
Are we not attending that either?

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:23.940
Let those scholars represent us

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:26.580
and build a cenotaph for him.

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:27.810
But...

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:28.580
Wanyin.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.620
Don't forget.

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:32.550
They are 2D characters.

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:35.210
If you forget this,

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.390
you'll be dragged down.

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:42.350
But when you heard about Wang Zhao's death
at Mount Bei,

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:43.880
you didn't react like this.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:50.130
That's why I remind myself

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.560
never to get too emotional.

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:15.359
Wanyin.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.160
You must listen to me on this.

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:23.069
If anything happens to you,

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:27.150
I can't go on living.

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:37.140
By the way,

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.270
your father sent a message

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:42.950
saying he wants to see you.

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:45.440
I guess

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.760
he's not doing well with Prince Duan

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.580
and sees an opportunity here.

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:51.470
He wants to use your influence

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.180
to find a new path for himself.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:58.100
Do you want to see him?

00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:58.760
No.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.780
As long as I don't see him,

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.710
he'll forever remain just a 2D character.

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:18.570
Your Majesty.

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:20.700
The Ministry of Revenue's Lord Chen,
the Ministry of Personnel's Lord Liang,

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.220
and the two ministers
from the Ministry of Justice

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:23.620
have all requested leave

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:24.180
saying

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:27.210
they cannot come for an audience today.

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:37.590
Die?

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:40.860
Capture?

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:49.880
Kill?

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.660
Is Her Majesty asking for water?

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:54.860
Water?

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:56.540
Water, water!

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:57.660
Quickly, get some water!

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:58.010
Yes.

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:19.530
Ma'am,

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:22.100
the path is rough here. Please be careful.

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:22.950
It's fine.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:26.750
Everyone,

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.480
are you all my son's colleagues?

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:33.290
We were Wang's closest friends,

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:52.730

that they cannot attend.

on the tombstone too.

will be remembered for generations.

that we cannot publicly praise
his achievements

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:51.910
Please don't blame yourself.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.230
This is Physician Xiao from the palace.

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:57.160
His medical skills are unmatched.

00:28:57.730 --> 00:28:58.860
His Majesty specifically ordered me

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:00.260
to bring him to treat you.

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:03.330
His Majesty also instructed

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:05.460
that you should rest and recover well.

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:06.750
Next year,

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.340
when the Yan millet ripens in the fields,

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:11.740
we'll go see it together.

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:18.140
Sure.

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:21.200
I will

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:24.290
do my best.

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:44.700
This person suffers
from an incurable disease.

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.960
He was likely born with this affliction.

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:48.490
Having not done anything until now,

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:49.950
it's beyond medical help.

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:55.900
The man inside

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.660
is a benefactor to everyone
in Great Xia.

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:01.910
Please, Physician Xiao,
help him live a little longer—

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:04.440
even if just to see one harvest.

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:05.620
I

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:07.520
will do my best.

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:16.460
[Agricultural Distribution Map]
[Yanwu Reserve Method]

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:25.050
Don't worry, Your Highness.

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:27.900
Since Physician Xiao is staying behind,

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:29.810
he must have a way to save Mr. Cen.

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:35.740
Let's hope so.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:42.870
[Agricultural Distribution Map 3]

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:49.950
The men I promised to lend you

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:51.610
will be waiting at the border.

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:53.030
Though not many,

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:55.180
they are all elite soldiers.

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.280
After this succeeds,

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.330
I hope our two nations
will remain allies forever

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:01.730
and never wage war again.

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:06.570
Are you so certain

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:08.460
that I will be the victor?

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:09.060
Of course.

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:11.840
We are the same kind of person.

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:17.420
You were forced
to become the prince of Yan State,

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:17.980
while I

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:21.960
reluctantly took the throne of Great Xia.

00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:26.100
Those around us commit all manner of evil,

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:28.580
yet we have become

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:30.520
puppets despised by thousands.

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:33.400
I once almost wanted to give up too.

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:36.250
But then I met someone very important.

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:39.150
She made me understand

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:40.840
what an emperor

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.140
should truly do.

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:47.530
As well as what
"heaven gave birth to the people"

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:49.330
and ordained their fate" means.

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:52.900
The way you Xia people speak in circles

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:54.740
is beyond my understanding.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:58.120
But you are a good emperor.

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:00.900
That's why I must win.

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.450
And you must win too.

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:09.580
People in our positions

00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:13.040
bear too many responsibilities and hopes.

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:16.210
We cannot be villains.

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:20.370
We may not become friends,

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.430
but as long as I remain in Great Yan,

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:24.910
Great Yan and Great Xia

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:27.920
will never become enemies.

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:45.990
Your Highness, someone's approaching.

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:47.570
Hold on tight.

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:54.310
Assassins!

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:55.460
Protect our master!

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:18.260
How insolent!

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:20.670
How dare you defy the law
and attack people here?

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:21.330
After them!

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:22.580
Yes, Your Highness.

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:23.310
My Lady.

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:25.530
It's getting late

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:27.690
and your carriage is damaged.

00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:28.970
May I offer you a ride?

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:39.330
May I ask where

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:42.310
your residence is, My Lady?

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.180
Your Highness surely knows how to jest.

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:49.420
Please escort me back to the palace.

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:52.690
I happened to be here on business today.

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:56.780
If anything were to happen
to Your Highness,

00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.780
His Majesty would be furious,

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.020
and we wouldn't be able
to bear the consequences.

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:03.400
At this point,

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:05.580
Prince Duan,

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:08.670
just be straightforward

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:10.150
with your mockery.

00:34:10.929 --> 00:34:13.130
You're quite favored in the palace now,

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:15.100
unmatched in prominence.

00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:18.370
I'm simply happy for you.

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:20.679
My relationship with His Majesty

00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:22.590
could hardly be something

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.980
you'd be happy about or anticipate.

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:25.840
Unless perhaps

00:34:26.219 --> 00:34:27.639
if I were to win his true affection,

00:34:27.639 --> 00:34:29.100
I would be of greater value

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:30.270
to Your Highness?

00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:33.750
After all, controlling me

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:37.060
would give you better leverage
over His Majesty.

00:34:39.449 --> 00:34:40.330
Yu Wanyin.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:45.219
Do you realize what you're saying?

00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:58.720
Xiahou Dan.

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:00.840
The person you said

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:02.560
is very important to you

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:05.220
is the Noble Consort, right?

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:09.470
You must protect her well!

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:16.620
Don't ever let her

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:19.590
become another Shanyi.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:20.720
Your Majesty!

00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:23.410
Your Majesty.

00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:28.340
Your Majesty.

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:28.870
Bad news.

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:31.870
The officials who haven't taken sides
have fallen ill

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:32.670
or died.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.570
He fears your spies

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.130
and dares not leave the palace.

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:41.720
He knows you intend to kill us,

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:44.860
yet still sends me, a mere woman, to go

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:46.950
just to demonstrate

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:49.210
that he is a wise ruler.

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:51.350
So you mean

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:54.150
your trip outside the palace

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:57.640
was His Majesty
sending you to win people over for him?

00:35:58.300 --> 00:35:59.900
And that his favor toward you

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:01.680
isn't genuine either?

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.740
That's quite a statement.

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:09.440
Are you any different?

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.810
Since I entered the palace,

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:16.750
everyone claims their heart belongs to me,

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:18.770
but deep down,

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:22.860
isn't it all just manipulation

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:24.960
and exploitation?

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:28.980
You have a point.

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:33.360
But for someone as clever as Wanyin,

00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:36.700
couldn't you find a way to refuse him?

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:39.220
Why should I refuse?

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:41.980
This is my best opportunity

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:44.240
to scout an escape route from the palace.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.410
You want to

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:48.900
escape?

00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:50.340
Your Majesty!

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:51.010
Your Majesty!

00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:52.490
I've already sent the Imperial Guards
to rescue Her Highness.

00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:55.010
-Your Majesty, you can't go!
-She's in danger. I need to save her.

00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:55.300
Dan!

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:56.010
-Let go!
-Your Majesty.

00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:56.380
Dan!

00:36:57.130 --> 00:36:57.980
You don't know martial arts.

00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:58.990
If you leave the palace,

00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:00.300
I fear I cannot protect you.

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:01.840
What if something happens to her?

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:02.350
Let go!

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:03.170
-Your Majesty.
-Dan!

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:03.680
Dan!

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:10.290
Mr. Bei.

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:12.390
You go.

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:15.410
Only you can save her.

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:16.860
Please, will you go?

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:17.660
If I go,

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:18.940
who will protect you?

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:19.650
But Mr. Bei...

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:20.300
You cannot go!
