00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.719
What are you selling here?

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.280
What is this stuff you've got laid out?

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.400
I can't tell.

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:45.239
Is it medicine?

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:47.040
Doesn't look like medicine.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.079
Doesn't look like medicine.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.120
Then why display it on such a pretty cloth?

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.120
I don't think it's medicine.

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:55.719
Then what is it?

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:59.680
By the looks of it...

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:01.719
It's cow dung.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.519
You have quite an imagination.

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:05.680
Who would display a pile of cow dung here?

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:07.159
Don't laugh.

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:09.359
I bet this is definitely cow dung.

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:10.560
Brother.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.319
You guessed right. You have a sharp eye.

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.000
It is cow dung.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.919
You're displaying cow dung here?

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:18.520
It is cow dung, alright.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.360
But my cow dung is no ordinary cow dung.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.680
Cow dung is just cow dung.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.080
This cow dung of yours...

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:28.039
What's so special about it?

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.400
There are several kinds of cows.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.319
There are yellow cattle, water buffalo...

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:35.319
Sand cattle, bulls...

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.919
And yaks.

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:39.360
The smallest is the snail.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.919
The hardest to see...

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:45.439
The rarest, weirdest, and most precious...

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:46.919
Is the rhino.

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:48.599
This dung of mine...

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.199
Is dung pooped by a rhino.

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.039
Rhinos come from foreign lands.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.400
Its dung is a precious medicinal ingredient.

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:59.479
So what's this thing good for?

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:02.080
If you eat this...

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:05.240
It reduces heat, clears heat, dispels heat, beats heat.

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.439
Dissolves thick phlegm, removes blood stasis.

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.960
The benefits are many, many, many.

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:12.639
Soak it in wine if you have it, or urine if you don't.

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:14.000
If you have neither wine nor urine...

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.560
Chewing it dry works too.

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:19.400
This isn't rhino dung.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.520
Fortune teller.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.439
Don't talk nonsense.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.159
This isn't ordinary rhino dung.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.080
This dung has a mellow scent, rich in medicinal fragrance.

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:30.000
It must be from Java.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.400
Dung from a white rhinoceros that eats only medicinal herbs.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.800
This is the finest of dungs.

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:37.680
Right!

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.800
See that?

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:42.680
Finally, an expert is here.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.960
Someone who knows his stuff.

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:47.039
If my family hadn't fallen on hard times...

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.039
I'd never sell this family heirloom.

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:53.360
This medicine...

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:56.080
I won't claim it brings the dead back to life...

00:03:56.479 --> 00:04:00.240
But cripples walk, mutes speak, and the blind see.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.360
It's like Hua Tuo treating a cold...

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:04.199
A piece of cake.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.919
I think you're a toad yawning...

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:09.280
Talking big.

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:10.680
Yeah.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.680
You got a shill here to put on a show.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.080
Sprinkling pepper on a grave...

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.759
Who are you trying to fool?

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:19.360
Move along, move along, everyone move along.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.240
Don't go! Don't go!

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.000
How could I know him?

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.920
How about this.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.639
If you can cure this cripple...

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.560
We'll believe you.

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:34.680
My leg can't be cured.

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:37.759
It's been like this since I was born.

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:40.079
My family sought famous doctors everywhere.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.519
Even those white-bearded doctors couldn't help.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.040
See? See?

00:04:44.519 --> 00:04:46.120
She was born with it.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.000
How could I possibly...

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.120
This...

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.199
But I can give it a try.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.279
To see if it can actually be cured.

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:55.800
Come, come here, come here.

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:57.759
Come, come, come.

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:00.240
Even if it's congenital, I can try.

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:03.879
Let's see if we can fix the problem.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.800
It can't be cured.

00:05:25.079 --> 00:05:26.759
I've been treated for years with no luck.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.240
I'm leaving.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.439
Why isn't it crippled anymore?

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.000
It really isn't crippled anymore!

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.040
I'm cured!

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.720
I'm actually cured!

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.480
I'm going to tell my grandpa!

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:43.399
Grandpa!

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:44.639
I'm cured!

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:58.360
Not bad.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.079
You made so much in just a while.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.079
You talked it up like magic.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.680
Yesterday my nephew bought your dung and ate it.

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:12.079
And today he's stiff as a board.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.120
What do you have to say?

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.399
Yesterday?

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:17.439
I wasn't even selling yesterday.

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:18.439
I only got here today.

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:20.199
It was you yesterday!

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:21.680
He ate your dung and got poisoned to death!

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:23.800
It was you!

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:25.639
I came with him to buy it yesterday.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.759
Luckily I didn't eat any.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.279
Or I'd be lying here today too.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.199
Listen, brothers.

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:34.120
I make my money...

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:36.079
...by relying on a little skill.

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:38.959
Are you just trying to rob me outright?

00:06:44.079 --> 00:06:47.240
My surname is Fan, courtesy name Pengju.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.360
Weiyuan Hall of Righteousness, holding the Yao rank.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.439
What's your rank at Noble Dragon Wharf?

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:56.639
I sit in your granddaddy's chair!

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.800
Pay up for the life! Get him!

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:02.199
Over there!

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:03.600
Why did you throw this to me?

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:12.040
Stop!

00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:16.079
Chase him!

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.879
Take the money and run!

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.600
Something's wrong.

00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:41.839
Why is it all stones?

00:07:41.839 --> 00:07:43.079
How should I know?

00:07:45.439 --> 00:07:46.600
It's with that chubby kid!

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.160
Chase him!

00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:49.560
Hurry up!

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:54.199
Run faster!

00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:04.800
Heaven has a grand plan.

00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:07.160
Man has his petty schemes.

00:08:08.199 --> 00:08:09.680
You have your seven calculations.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.279
I have my eight calculations.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.199
Young Master.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.279
My old man...

00:08:14.519 --> 00:08:15.600
Is he doing okay?

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.439
When he found you were gone...

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.439
...he's been in tears all day long.

00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:22.319
I bet he wants to skin me alive.

00:08:22.319 --> 00:08:23.639
And rip out my tendons.

00:08:25.879 --> 00:08:26.519
Young Master.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.399
Just come back with me.

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:30.040
Living rough out here...

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.879
...surviving on scams and tricks.

00:08:32.079 --> 00:08:33.439
How can that compare to the comfort of home?

00:08:34.199 --> 00:08:35.199
Take this money.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.639
Pretend you never saw me.

00:08:37.839 --> 00:08:39.320
I must take you back.

00:08:39.759 --> 00:08:40.519
Forgive me.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.320
Stop! Over there!

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:44.399
Run! Why aren't you running now?

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.399
You dare steal my prize?

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:50.240
The court has no empty land, the world has no idle men.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.559
Five miles across the river, ask for salt and rice first.

00:08:52.879 --> 00:08:54.360
You think you can just...

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.600
...walk away with the money so easily?

00:08:55.679 --> 00:08:57.320
What are you saying? I don't understand.

00:08:57.639 --> 00:08:59.279
You're like a shadow puppet rubbing its back...

00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:00.440
...your skin is itching.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.360
Like a blacksmith dying with eyes open...

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.399
...you're just begging to be hammered!

00:09:03.639 --> 00:09:04.559
Hand over the money.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.159
Young Master.

00:09:06.399 --> 00:09:07.559
Wait aside for a moment.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.639
So I don't accidentally hurt you.

00:09:11.039 --> 00:09:11.720
Come on.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.559
The money is here.

00:09:14.039 --> 00:09:15.039
If you have the skill...

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.000
...come and get it.

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:20.279
Get him!

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:48.840
Young Master

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:50.759
Young Master

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.480
They didn't rob me, didn't chase me.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.559
I wouldn't have known that little bastard was tricking me.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.559
He's been playing me like a monkey all along.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.679
Now I'm truly a horse on a boat's bow.

00:10:09.279 --> 00:10:11.279
Nowhere to run.

00:10:11.919 --> 00:10:14.000
You've been played by that kid several times already.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.919
I told you to trust me!

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.559
It's just you causing trouble here.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.600
You've got my head spinning.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.639
Go scram.

00:10:22.279 --> 00:10:23.639
Why are you chasing me away?

00:10:23.799 --> 00:10:25.360
If you'd let me tell your fortune earlier,

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.320
maybe things wouldn't have ended up like this.

00:10:27.399 --> 00:10:28.360
Are you leaving or not?

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.600
When I get mad, I even scare myself.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.279
Stop right there.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:35.639
I'm going.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.200
Don't follow me.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.639
Thank you, Brother.

00:10:50.159 --> 00:10:52.080
Take care, Brother. Come again!

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.000
Brother, want a haircut?

00:10:57.759 --> 00:10:59.440
Come on, have a seat, have a seat.

00:11:00.279 --> 00:11:01.320
I'll give you a haircut today.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.039
Good luck in all things, no need to worry.

00:11:03.159 --> 00:11:04.080
Sit tight.

00:11:06.639 --> 00:11:08.039
Give me a shave.

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:09.039
Alright.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.080
Green hills beyond hills, towers beyond towers.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.600
My shaving skills are the best in the business.

00:11:17.799 --> 00:11:18.240
You...

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.679
First, shave off my eyebrows.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.080
What?

00:11:21.559 --> 00:11:22.679
Shave your eyebrows?

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.080
Brother,

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.600
don't pull my leg.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.519
Who the hell is pulling your leg?

00:11:29.039 --> 00:11:29.759
Alright then.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.200
You asked for it.

00:11:32.519 --> 00:11:33.639
If it turns out wrong...

00:11:33.639 --> 00:11:34.960
You talk too much.

00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:40.279
Brother, I'm shaving them.

00:11:41.279 --> 00:11:42.279
Do it.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.159
Done, Brother. Two copper coins.

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:55.919
Something's not right.

00:11:57.399 --> 00:11:58.320
What's not right?

00:11:59.399 --> 00:12:02.080
I look more and more like a boiled egg.

00:12:03.559 --> 00:12:05.039
It does look a bit like a boiled egg.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.960
Why did you shave off my eyebrows?

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.840
You asked me to shave them!

00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:15.519
Am I crazy?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.840
Is there anyone in the world stupid enough

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:18.759
to tell someone

00:12:18.759 --> 00:12:20.759
to shave off their own eyebrows?

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.120
You've ruined my face.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.279
That's truly wicked of you.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.440
You just shouted

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.039
to have your eyebrows shaved!

00:12:29.159 --> 00:12:32.000
I told you to shave my hair!

00:12:32.639 --> 00:12:33.840
Everyone knows,

00:12:34.039 --> 00:12:35.840
in the Jianghu, shaving eyebrows

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.679
is a huge humiliation.

00:12:38.799 --> 00:12:39.440
Exactly.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.480
Make him pay up.

00:12:40.559 --> 00:12:41.759
Who'd dare get a haircut here now?

00:12:41.759 --> 00:12:42.919
Shaving off someone's eyebrows...

00:12:43.279 --> 00:12:45.000
Your skills are just too poor.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.639
Just too poor, your skills.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.600
Bullying an outsider, huh?

00:12:49.879 --> 00:12:52.559
Is there anyone here to uphold justice?

00:12:52.799 --> 00:12:53.799
Looking like this,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.240
how can I go meet people?

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.120
Pay up! Pay up! Pay up!

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.399
Alright, alright, alright.

00:13:01.679 --> 00:13:03.639
I'll pay, I'll pay.

00:13:04.799 --> 00:13:05.919
I won't ask for much.

00:13:06.759 --> 00:13:07.799
One eyebrow,

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.399
five copper coins.

00:13:09.639 --> 00:13:10.600
That's ten in total.

00:13:12.879 --> 00:13:13.559
Hurry up and pay.

00:13:13.559 --> 00:13:15.840
Pay up! Pay up! Pay up!

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:16.919
Just pay him.

00:13:16.919 --> 00:13:17.919
Hand over the money.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.279
Just my luck running into you.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.120
Want to eat?

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.000
Why are you haunting me?

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.480
I did a little divination.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.559
And knew you'd be here.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:39.799
Add a pair of chopsticks.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.840
I didn't say I wanted to eat.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.600
I just calculated...

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.440
That you earned ten copper coins.

00:13:49.639 --> 00:13:50.279
Then did you calculate...

00:13:50.279 --> 00:13:51.919
That I don't want to spend them right now?

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.919
Let's treat ourselves together.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.759
Are you sure you want to eat with me?

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.559
Even better with some wine.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.399
Let's go.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:03.639
Alright.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:12.799
Sit.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.080
That belongs to someone else.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.440
Just sit down.

00:14:20.159 --> 00:14:21.600
Don't panic, there's chicken soup.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.279
Don't rush, there's intestines.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:24.360
Wait...

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.759
We can't eat other people's food.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.080
Eat if you want.

00:14:27.399 --> 00:14:28.480
Leave if you don't.

00:14:29.039 --> 00:14:30.519
Don't you have ten coppers?

00:14:31.679 --> 00:14:32.639
I already told you.

00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:33.919
I don't want to spend them.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.480
Eating like this...

00:14:36.559 --> 00:14:38.440
If we get caught, we're in trouble.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.039
One person ordering so many dishes...

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.559
And leaving without eating...

00:14:45.399 --> 00:14:46.320
It's a waste.

00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:49.120
I call this saving food.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.120
Serving the food! Serving the food!

00:14:51.519 --> 00:14:52.720
Here comes the dish!

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.279
Authentic Zhongjiang Black Pig Twice-Cooked Pork.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.840
Here, help make some room.

00:15:00.919 --> 00:15:01.360
Here.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.159
And the wine. Two taels.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.039
Take your time, enjoy.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.240
The wine isn't right.

00:15:08.519 --> 00:15:09.480
Is this really two taels?

00:15:09.679 --> 00:15:10.519
How could it not be two taels?

00:15:10.519 --> 00:15:11.679
We just poured it with the ladle.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.799
Not right. This isn't two taels.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:15.559
It definitely is.

00:15:15.759 --> 00:15:17.159
Come, come, try it.

00:15:17.159 --> 00:15:17.679
Try it if you don't believe me.

00:15:17.679 --> 00:15:18.720
Come on.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.440
Drink up.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:25.399
What?

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.039
I just went to pick someone up...

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.080
And you cleaned out my table of food.

00:15:36.559 --> 00:15:37.639
You even... right in front of my face...

00:15:37.639 --> 00:15:39.200
Ate my pig ear.

00:15:39.399 --> 00:15:40.279
Boss.

00:15:46.519 --> 00:15:47.720
Darn it.

00:15:47.799 --> 00:15:49.639
Mooching food off of me?

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.679
I think you two are mice playing with a cat.

00:15:51.679 --> 00:15:53.039
You won't even know how you died.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.759
Boss, it's a misunderstanding.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.159
We're civilized people.

00:15:57.399 --> 00:15:58.799
How could we be mooching?

00:15:59.039 --> 00:16:00.480
How could we eat for free?

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.799
Everyone caught says that.

00:16:04.519 --> 00:16:06.159
We have money.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.159
You have money?

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.559
Then hand it over.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.240
It's on him.

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:13.600
Pay up.

00:16:18.399 --> 00:16:18.960
You pay.

00:16:20.759 --> 00:16:21.639
I don't have money.

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:22.919
You don't have money?

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.080
Kill him.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.039
Enough! Enough!

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.600
Beating taken, food eaten.

00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:37.960
These ten coppers should cover it, right?

00:16:40.679 --> 00:16:42.600
Kid, learn from your Brother.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.080
So righteous.

00:16:44.519 --> 00:16:45.759
Should've taken it out sooner.

00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:52.440
I told you we'd get in trouble.

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.279
I didn't get in trouble.

00:16:55.799 --> 00:16:57.399
We shouldn't eat other people's food.

00:16:57.399 --> 00:16:58.960
You should have listened to me.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.120
If I listened to you...

00:17:01.559 --> 00:17:03.120
You'd have suffered even worse.

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.840
Little fatty, stand still.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.480
Stand still, little fatty.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.359
Where are you running off to now?

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.119
What?

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:15.640
Stand still.

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:18.440
Stand still.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:35.680
Run, then.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Think you can get away?

00:17:38.359 --> 00:17:39.039
My money!

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.119
Give it back!

00:17:40.359 --> 00:17:41.160
I've been robbed!

00:17:41.599 --> 00:17:42.640
Didn't leave a single cent!

00:17:45.039 --> 00:17:47.200
You're playing games with me.

00:17:47.759 --> 00:17:48.759
Acting dumb, are you?

00:17:49.079 --> 00:17:49.759
You want more?

00:17:50.039 --> 00:17:50.799
What?

00:17:50.799 --> 00:17:51.519
Don't run!

00:17:52.119 --> 00:17:52.799
Stop!

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.039
Who are you?

00:17:58.359 --> 00:17:59.599
He's from Across the river.

00:18:02.279 --> 00:18:03.880
You catch up fast.

00:18:04.359 --> 00:18:06.000
Both of you, come with me.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:06.920
Stand still.

00:18:07.839 --> 00:18:08.519
Come back!

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.640
Just a kid.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.200
A little kid.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.839
Why give him a hard time?

00:18:18.519 --> 00:18:19.400
How about this.

00:18:20.359 --> 00:18:22.559
We'll go one round.

00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:26.160
If you beat me and knock me down,

00:18:26.599 --> 00:18:27.559
I'll go with you.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.359
It's not up to you.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.000
He's actually pretty tough.

00:18:31.559 --> 00:18:32.079
Maybe not.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.119
Am I that weak?

00:18:34.119 --> 00:18:34.880
Move!

00:19:34.079 --> 00:19:36.279
I wasn't ready yet!

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.000
Playing tricks on me?

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.519
Had enough?

00:19:45.599 --> 00:19:47.759
Run! Run!

00:20:15.079 --> 00:20:16.000
Do you yield?

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.039
How was that?

00:20:23.839 --> 00:20:24.680
Not bad.

00:20:28.799 --> 00:20:30.599
My Old man sent him to catch me.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.039
You saved me.

00:20:33.759 --> 00:20:35.039
Sent by your Old man?

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.640
You and your Old man...

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.599
What kind of grudge is there?

00:20:40.519 --> 00:20:42.400
He's posting notices everywhere to find me.

00:20:45.839 --> 00:20:46.640
I remember now.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.680
I thought you looked familiar.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.759
You're the one from Weiyuan...

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.240
The face on the wanted poster?

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.680
Did you see who posted it?

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.119
I haven't seen that yet.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.160
I only saw "Huge Reward for Missing Son".

00:20:59.559 --> 00:21:00.920
If I take you back,

00:21:01.359 --> 00:21:02.599
I can claim the reward.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:03.960
Then I'll say...

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.599
You kidnapped me.

00:21:05.839 --> 00:21:08.039
What kind of kidnapper is that dumb?

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.640
Walking right into a trap?

00:21:10.559 --> 00:21:12.240
Your Old man won't believe that.

00:21:15.039 --> 00:21:17.519
I had my reasons for running away.

00:21:18.079 --> 00:21:19.519
If you send me back,

00:21:20.319 --> 00:21:21.079
I don't know...

00:21:21.799 --> 00:21:23.680
if I'll live to see tomorrow's sun.

00:21:26.839 --> 00:21:28.680
Did you dig up your family's ancestral grave?

00:21:30.079 --> 00:21:31.279
He was marrying a concubine.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.599
And in the bridal chamber,

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:34.960
I let loose a nest of rats.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.279
You... You...

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.240
You deserve a beating.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.000
You...

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.920
That's exactly what I would've done!

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.400
My mom died young.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.039
And my Old man is strict.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.240
The concubine he married...

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.640
Sees me as a thorn in her side.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.920
Says I'm no good at studying,

00:22:01.759 --> 00:22:03.200
and that I'll be useless when I grow up.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.240
She says I'm a hopeless case.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.920
Who says?

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.000
That you have to study to be someone?

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.319
The more they say that,

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.359
the more I want to make a name for myself.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:18.839
When I go back,

00:22:19.079 --> 00:22:20.319
I'll show them all.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:23.440
What about you?

00:22:24.079 --> 00:22:26.079
Why did you come to this side of the river?

00:22:27.119 --> 00:22:28.480
It's a long story.

00:22:29.519 --> 00:22:30.480
The two of us...

00:22:31.319 --> 00:22:34.200
We're really in the same boat.

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.079
So, can you...

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.400
Let me go?

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.960
Of course.

00:22:41.799 --> 00:22:42.400
For real?

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.599
For real.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.240
Let's go.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.440
Your half

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.519
You should just keep it all

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.160
You've got a bunch of brothers to feed

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.319
Really?

00:23:12.759 --> 00:23:13.359
Really

00:23:15.079 --> 00:23:16.119
Then I'm off

00:23:25.079 --> 00:23:26.519
We're both from Weiyuan

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.279
Ups and downs, and fate brought us together

00:23:30.799 --> 00:23:32.119
In all the time I've been out here,

00:23:32.559 --> 00:23:33.960
you're the only good person I've met

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.160
I want to become sworn brothers with you

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.960
And call you Brother

00:23:43.799 --> 00:23:45.880
Since you think so highly of me, little brother,

00:23:46.519 --> 00:23:48.240
I must accept the honor

00:23:49.039 --> 00:23:49.640
Please

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:53.319
Today,

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.440
I become the Sworn Elder Brother

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.039
I become the Sworn Younger Brother

00:23:57.359 --> 00:23:58.799
Sworn as brothers

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.000
Entrusting life and death to each other

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.240
Heaven and Earth as our witnesses

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.400
We swear never to betray this bond

00:24:09.799 --> 00:24:10.440
Brother

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:11.400
Brother

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.599
Thanks for today, Brother

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.359
If you ever need me in the future, Brother,

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.400
I'll be there for you, heart and soul

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.640
The Jianghu is treacherous

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.319
Let us both stay safe

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.119
We shall meet again

00:24:25.359 --> 00:24:26.160
We shall

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:55.160
You're here

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.480
Since you're here anyway

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.160
Just sleep here together. Come on

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.359
I'd rather sleep on the curb

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.400
I calculated it

00:25:04.759 --> 00:25:06.000
There will be thunderstorms tonight

00:25:10.119 --> 00:25:11.240
Unbelievable

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.240
"True Madness"

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:28.359
I really am a bit mad

00:25:29.599 --> 00:25:30.599
At the critical moment,

00:25:31.559 --> 00:25:33.599
it's less useful than a brick

00:25:57.599 --> 00:25:58.200
Come on

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.359
Give me your birth date and time

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.079
Just let me read your fortune once

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.200
Bingshen Year, seventh day of the third month

00:26:09.799 --> 00:26:10.799
Bingshen Year

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:13.680
You really are a Monkey

00:26:13.759 --> 00:26:14.720
I told you

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.880
My sign is Sun Wukong

00:26:16.559 --> 00:26:18.119
I thought you were pulling my leg

00:26:19.039 --> 00:26:19.920
Calculate for me,

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.799
where my next meal is coming from

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:22.559
No, no, no

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.920
Your street smarts are enough to feed you

00:26:25.079 --> 00:26:26.960
I want to see if you have great potential

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:31.880
Bingshen Year, seventh of the third month

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:34.240
Your Sun sign is a sheep

00:26:35.079 --> 00:26:37.720
Moon sign is a scorpion

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.319
Rising sign is a crab

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.079
You mention these things and now I want to eat them

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.039
Very soon,

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.759
you will meet a romantic interest

00:26:49.799 --> 00:26:51.039
If it goes well,

00:26:51.359 --> 00:26:52.839
it's a good destiny

00:26:53.519 --> 00:26:54.599
If it goes badly,

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.200
it might be a bit hot to handle

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.640
Actually, your best romance is at age ninety

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.119
Ninety?

00:27:01.799 --> 00:27:03.920
I'm starving to death right now!

00:27:04.359 --> 00:27:05.599
Go climb a tree!

00:27:06.119 --> 00:27:07.599
"Climb" is a good word

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.200
You have the destiny of a vine

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:10.839
If you have a big tree to rely on,

00:27:11.359 --> 00:27:13.880
you will climb higher and higher, soaring to the sky

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:16.680
If there's no big tree to rely on,

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.799
you can only crawl on the ground

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.559
And easily crawl astray

00:27:26.079 --> 00:27:27.160
However,

00:27:27.559 --> 00:27:29.480
you have many tribulations in your fate

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.880
That you must overcome yourself

00:27:31.799 --> 00:27:33.480
Calling you a lucky star now,

00:27:34.079 --> 00:27:35.319
is still too early

00:27:37.079 --> 00:27:38.720
But I bet you're a talent

00:27:39.279 --> 00:27:40.680
Whether you can achieve greatness,

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.960
depends on you

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.240
Little sister

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.440
What are you eating?

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.160
Sesame cake

00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.799
Shall I bite it into a moon for you?

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.039
I can do it

00:29:02.559 --> 00:29:03.599
Is this it?

00:29:06.119 --> 00:29:07.880
I'll bite it into a Pen Holder Mountain

00:29:08.279 --> 00:29:09.039
I can do it

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.079
Is this it?

00:29:12.279 --> 00:29:14.720
Do you want to see the Heavenly Dog eat the moon?

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:34.319
Dummy

00:31:36.119 --> 00:31:37.319
I'm sorry.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.079
Don't walk on by, buy a cup.

00:31:46.079 --> 00:31:47.240
I guarantee once you drink it,

00:31:47.359 --> 00:31:49.799
you'll want another sip.

00:31:50.599 --> 00:31:52.119
Take a look, take a look.

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:06.920
Wife.

00:32:08.319 --> 00:32:09.960
How come you're

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.759
selling wine here?

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:20.440
I missed you so much.
