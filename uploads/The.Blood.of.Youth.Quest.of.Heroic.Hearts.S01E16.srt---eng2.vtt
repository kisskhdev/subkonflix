00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.800
Is my order ready?

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.030
Coming!

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.560
I heard many people died

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.080
on the eastern street last night.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.430
Enjoy.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.870
They say it was done by a woman.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.630
A woman?

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.840
How so?

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.560
Did any of them manage to survive?

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.870
Impossible.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.590
The victims were all killed by a single cut on their throats.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.000
Someone saw her from afar.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.030
They were terrified.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.960
Come. Dig in.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.430
Powerful

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.590
and ruthless.

Weigui.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.470
Could this

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.840
be the Divine Maiden?

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.360
I'm not sure.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.870
I feel like checking the eastern street out.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.840
If it truly is the Divine Maiden,

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.960
I want to persuade her

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.910
to turn over a new leaf.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.280
But she and we

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.710
are fundamentally different.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.750
Even if

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.430
she turns into a kind person,

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.310
her hands

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.000
are already tainted with blood.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.280
You hail from a righteous sect.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.680
The two of you

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.310
stand on opposite sides.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.590
Perhaps you should give up.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.910
I know.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.310
I just hope

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.750
it isn't her doing.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:58.470
Something's wrong

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:59.840
with Hua Xiaohua lately.

Hua Xiaohua.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.750
What are you doing here this late at night?

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.630
We were so worried about you.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.630
I came

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.040
to find myself a blessed burial spot.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.830
What are you talking about?

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.950
I am afflicted with a peculiar poison.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.560
I killed innocents.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.070
I don't want to live anymore.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.120
So, you are the murderer they spoke of on the street.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.070
Were you poisoned in the peach blossom forest?

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:09.830
I've tried.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.630
I can't cure myself.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.800
You can't,

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.160
but your master can.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.360
Find your master

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.720
and you will be cured.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.270
My master's exceptional medical knowledge

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.160
can cure any ailment in the world.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.270
But he's always traveling.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.000
I don't know where he is.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.750
Even if we can't locate your master,

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.360
there must be a way to cure you too.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:36.270
That's right.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.720
Perhaps someone can help you.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:51.630
This should be the place.

The expert

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.000

lives here?

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.120
The elders in my clan once mentioned

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:01.270
that

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.360
an expert from Tangmen lived in seclusion in this place.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:04.390
Only he

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.630
can remove the poison in Hua Xiaohua.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.240

To think that one day,

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.390
people of the Lei's Stronghold would come begging Tangmen for help.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.560
I've lived in this manor for many years,

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.310
with hardly any visitors.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.000

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.950
the first one who shows up

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.750
is actually my sworn enemy.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.270
Great!

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.920
Your sect and my clan have fought for many years.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.510
We've become both friends and enemies.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.000
We're not just enemies.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.240
I also do not come with any malice.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.000
My friend's life is hanging

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:58.870
by a thread due to a particular poison.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.720
Please help us, Sir.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.360
How funny.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.950
Tangmen is renowned for its poison.

We don't save people.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:09.950
If you can make poison,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.070
you can also make antidotes.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:12.950

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.240
that you

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:15.310

can cure her peculiar ailment.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.870
You are right about that.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.160

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.310
why should I help you?

I...

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.070
I'm willing to be experimented on.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.800

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.270
You know my rules very well.

Mr. Tang.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:13.360
Both of you came at a great time.

[Tangmen Elder]
These are the poisons

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.920

Any one of them

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.270
will make you wish

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:40.790
you were dead.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.270
If you

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:45.000
can test

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:47.200
these three poisons for me,

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.030

Are you sure about it?

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:05.840
I hope once I take these poisons,

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:07.270
you

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.000
will keep your promise.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:10.910
I am

Where's Mr. Tang?

You survived those three poisons.

Mr. Tang agreed

Good.

I knew I could be the strongest swordsman.

Mere poison

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:39.320
will not kill me.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:44.910
God knows how I survived the poison.

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:47.550
I was surprised

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.080
at how reckless you were.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:51.670
Reckless?

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.440
Would you have done it if it were you?

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:58.000
Of course, not.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.510
You would've done it.

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:03.510
I wouldn't.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:05.790
You most definitely would.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.030
Indeed, people of the Lei's Stronghold

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:16.600
are impetuous.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.840
He was willing

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.750
to ingest such a dangerous poison.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.550
He has been administered the antidote.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:27.960
He will be fine.

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:31.360
But it seems like

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:33.630
he won't be able

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:36.120
to take the other two poisons.

00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:59.120
If Lei's Stronghold learns

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.270
that he dies here,

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.510
you'll be in a lot of trouble.

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:06.360
I am an orphan.

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:08.240
Why not experiment on me?

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.550
Besides,

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:13.080
both the poisoned and he

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:15.030
are my close friends.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.790
I am willing to take the risk for them.

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:24.000
Good.

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:25.870
If you insist on

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.670
becoming my test subject,

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.150
so be it.
