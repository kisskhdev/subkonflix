WEBVTT

00:00:00.015 --> 00:00:01.909
(Child actors were accompanied by a guardian...)

00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:03.609
(and filmed in a safe, supervised environment.)

00:00:05.579 --> 00:00:07.519
He said I looked familiar, too.

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:09.419
No way...

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:12.419
Pork cutlet is my absolute favourite. You look strangely familiar.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:17.329
Yang Hyun Bin.

00:00:27.639 --> 00:00:28.709
Jun Hyeok, where are you?

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:33.039
Where's a guy with no girlfriend or plans on a weekend?

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:35.649
- At work? - Yes, what's up?

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:39.449
- You know someone in HR, right? - Yes, what's up?

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:42.949
No questions asked, just get me the director's name.

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.459
- That would be Pacundo... - Not that one. His Korean name.

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:49.129
(Episode 5)

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:54.499
- One pork cutlet, please. - Okay.

00:01:30.129 --> 00:01:31.569
(I could eat this every day!)

00:01:31.629 --> 00:01:32.839
(Fell in love with the guy who works here!)

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:34.139
(Opening a new location soon?)

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:39.979
(We love the owner, Cutlet King!)

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:42.609
Come on.

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:51.349
(Yang Hyun Bin and Gong Ju Ah were here. )

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:53.089
"Yang Hyun Bin and Gong Ju Ah were here."

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:54.819
This pork cutlet is so good.

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:05.169
Crybaby Yang Hyun Bin is going to study abroad.

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:25.859
(Pork cutlet with cheese)

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:35.059
(Great vibe, food, cute owner!)

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:58.519
So, what did you find out? The director's name?

00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:00.989
He wasn't imitating Hyun Bin for no reason.

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.789
His name is Hyun Bin. Yang Hyun Bin.

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:06.599
Got it. See you later.

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:13.039
- One pork cutlet, please. - You got it.

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:38.799
Liar.

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:41.359
As if you were going to remember anyway.

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:50.839
Thank you.

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:53.909
- Can I get some water, please? - Yes.

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:13.999
Ms. Gong Ju Ah.

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:15.869
Yes, Director.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:18.529
What are you doing here?

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:21.139
I live nearby.

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:25.209
That's right. You do.

00:04:25.679 --> 00:04:28.239
What about you, Director? What brings you here?

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:30.849
Oh, well...

00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:33.079
It's just that...

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:35.949
Let me guess.

00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:38.519
You were visiting your family.

00:04:38.519 --> 00:04:40.689
You like checking out restaurants, and you love pork cutlets,

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:42.559
so you must've looked it up.

00:04:42.929 --> 00:04:46.099
In Onjeong, this is the most famous pork cutlet spot.

00:04:46.829 --> 00:04:48.199
That's why you're here.

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:49.729
Am I right?

00:04:50.329 --> 00:04:51.329
That's right.

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:53.999
You've got it all figured out.

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:11.419
Actually, it's been a while for me, too.

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:15.489
I never expected to run into you here.

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:18.029
Me neither.

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:27.069
Remember how I told you about someone I used to know?

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:30.439
A guy named Yang Hyun Bin?

00:05:33.239 --> 00:05:34.879
My gosh, here.

00:05:37.179 --> 00:05:38.209
Did you?

00:05:38.709 --> 00:05:41.279
Yes. I mentioned it at the last company dinner,

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:45.789
and you asked if that Yang Hyun Bin was my first love, remember?

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:50.729
Right, you said your families were mortal enemies.

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:52.259
Yes.

00:05:52.829 --> 00:05:55.159
I used to come here with him sometimes.

00:05:57.869 --> 00:05:58.869
I see.

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:13.149
I thought I'd be eating alone. Thanks for keeping me company.

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:16.219
I was just about to say the same thing.

00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:23.229
If you're visiting family, why did you have lunch alone?

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:27.499
Everyone's just a bit busy.

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:29.829
I see.

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:32.969
So are you staying at your parents' tonight?

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:36.109
No, I'm just planning to head back.

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:39.609
You should at least have dinner with your family.

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:43.749
You said it's awkward with them. This is a good chance to get closer.

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:49.389
I've overstepped, haven't I?

00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:54.859
Seeing you here in the neighbourhood, it felt casual, so I overstepped.

00:06:55.929 --> 00:06:56.959
I'm sorry.

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:00.159
Actually...

00:07:00.829 --> 00:07:03.799
I'm only here for one year, and then I go back to Argentina.

00:07:08.239 --> 00:07:09.269
I see.

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:11.939
Still, for the year that I'm here,

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:14.609
I'll try to get closer with my family.

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:17.909
All right.

00:07:20.619 --> 00:07:22.749
I should get going.

00:07:23.019 --> 00:07:25.719
- Okay, see you at work. - Okay.

00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:36.469
So, Yang Hyun Bin, your rival family's son,

00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:37.829
is Director Pacu Nacho?

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:42.739
Yes. And get this.

00:07:42.739 --> 00:07:44.839
In the past, he confessed he had a crush on me.

00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:50.049
Wait, but...

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:52.879
You figured this out just now?

00:07:52.949 --> 00:07:54.219
You didn't recognise him this whole time?

00:07:54.649 --> 00:07:58.019
That's right. His personality and looks have changed so much,

00:07:58.219 --> 00:07:59.719
it never even crossed my mind.

00:08:01.419 --> 00:08:04.989
Then why didn't he let on that he knew you?

00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:06.659
You think he didn't recognise you either?

00:08:06.759 --> 00:08:09.169
No way. It's not like my name is common.

00:08:09.499 --> 00:08:11.969
Plus, he knew where I live.

00:08:12.739 --> 00:08:14.869
That's so weird. Why would he do that?

00:08:15.239 --> 00:08:17.209
Maybe he doesn't want to bring up the past?

00:08:18.009 --> 00:08:19.139
Anyway, he was...

00:08:19.609 --> 00:08:23.879
panicking that I'd figured it out. He was stammering like crazy.

00:08:25.209 --> 00:08:28.779
My gosh. It was so hard to pretend I had no idea.

00:08:29.489 --> 00:08:32.119
Not at all. She has absolutely no idea.

00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:33.589
Are you sure?

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:35.959
I'm sure.

00:08:36.229 --> 00:08:40.029
She probably just thinks that Yang Hyun Bin and I are a lot alike.

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:44.199
Maybe she recognised you but pretended not to, to spare you.

00:08:45.069 --> 00:08:46.069
No.

00:08:47.099 --> 00:08:49.869
If she knew, she would have reacted, knowing Gong Ju Ah.

00:08:50.439 --> 00:08:54.879
She'd have smacked my head and yelled, "Crybaby Hyun Bin!"

00:08:55.209 --> 00:08:56.779
I could have just smacked him on the back of the head...

00:08:56.849 --> 00:09:00.279
and yelled, "Hey, snot-nosed Yang Hyun Bin!"

00:09:00.619 --> 00:09:03.949
Gosh, what a shame, really. If only he weren't my director.

00:09:05.149 --> 00:09:09.459
So you'll just keep treating him as Director Pacu Nacho from now on?

00:09:09.659 --> 00:09:12.699
I have to. He has a girlfriend,

00:09:12.759 --> 00:09:16.029
and it would be totally rude to bring up that first love stuff.

00:09:17.469 --> 00:09:18.729
Besides, the director...

00:09:19.399 --> 00:09:23.069
said he's only staying for one year before he returns to Argentina.

00:09:24.869 --> 00:09:28.039
What's with that look on your face? You look so disappointed.

00:09:28.379 --> 00:09:30.349
- I do not. - Yes, you do. Hey,

00:09:30.679 --> 00:09:33.519
don't tell me he was your first love, too.

00:09:37.119 --> 00:09:38.689
I really liked her.

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:40.519
Gong Ju Ah...

00:09:40.819 --> 00:09:43.059
She was my saviour, the one who ended my misery.

00:09:44.059 --> 00:09:45.389
I know I was young,

00:09:46.229 --> 00:09:49.569
but I honestly thought she was the only one for me.

00:09:49.669 --> 00:09:53.399
Oh, so that's why you blew me off when I asked you out.

00:09:55.199 --> 00:09:56.209
But...

00:09:56.669 --> 00:09:59.009
I never contacted her once after I went to study abroad.

00:09:59.439 --> 00:10:00.439
Why?

00:10:01.879 --> 00:10:04.749
Because we were never meant to be.

00:10:05.409 --> 00:10:06.449
What's that supposed to mean?

00:10:06.979 --> 00:10:08.779
What, are your families sworn enemies or something?

00:10:09.819 --> 00:10:11.619
- Yes. - What?

00:10:11.989 --> 00:10:13.389
My grandmother...

00:10:14.859 --> 00:10:15.959
and Gong Ju Ah's...

00:10:17.989 --> 00:10:19.359
grandfather...

00:10:20.029 --> 00:10:23.669
What? Did they fall in love and elope or something?

00:10:24.429 --> 00:10:26.599
- Yes. - What?

00:10:26.599 --> 00:10:30.939
Plus, my dad had a crush on her mother.

00:10:31.209 --> 00:10:33.939
He married my mom, not loving her, and then they got divorced,

00:10:34.179 --> 00:10:36.949
and my stepmom knows all about it.

00:10:37.709 --> 00:10:39.149
And both our families...

00:10:39.619 --> 00:10:41.819
are even bigger rivals now than they were then.

00:10:44.889 --> 00:10:46.359
Let me put it this way.

00:10:47.559 --> 00:10:49.959
Even now, our grandparents,

00:10:49.959 --> 00:10:51.589
our parents, their children, and even our in-laws...

00:10:51.789 --> 00:10:55.329
are probably out in the market fighting each other.

00:10:58.669 --> 00:11:01.499
- Yang Dong Ik! - Gong Jeong Han!

00:11:01.669 --> 00:11:05.839
- Gong Jeong Han! - Number two, Gong Jeong Han!

00:11:05.909 --> 00:11:08.779
- Yang Dong Ik! - Yang Dong Ik!

00:11:08.939 --> 00:11:11.549
- Number 1, Yang Dong Ik! - Number 1, Yang Dong Ik!

00:11:11.949 --> 00:11:13.649
- Yang Dong Ik! - Louder!

00:11:13.719 --> 00:11:16.049
- Yang Dong Ik! - Yes.

00:11:16.119 --> 00:11:17.789
- Number one, Yang Dong Ik! - Please keep moving.

00:11:17.919 --> 00:11:20.789
The business expert of Onjeong Market!

00:11:20.959 --> 00:11:24.129
I'm Candidate Number One, Yang Dong Ik!

00:11:25.089 --> 00:11:27.629
The trusted doctor of the Onjeong Market merchants.

00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:31.229
I'm Candidate Number Two, Gong Jeong Han!

00:11:31.469 --> 00:11:32.999
(Empathetic Leadership for the Merchants of Onjeong Market)

00:11:33.069 --> 00:11:34.069
(Onjeong Market's Business Expert)

00:11:34.799 --> 00:11:37.439
Can Onjeong Market really go on like this?

00:11:37.839 --> 00:11:39.879
This market must change!

00:11:39.939 --> 00:11:42.879
That's not true, everyone! The market's traditions...

00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:45.179
must be preserved!

00:11:45.179 --> 00:11:47.749
- Gong Jeong Han! - Yang Dong Ik!

00:11:48.019 --> 00:11:49.649
- Yang Dong Ik! - A candidate who's ready to work.

00:11:49.719 --> 00:11:53.259
Empathetic leadership! Vote for number two, Gong Jeong Han.

00:11:53.319 --> 00:11:55.359
- Thank you. Hello there. - Here.

00:11:55.419 --> 00:11:56.829
- Hello. - A candidate who's ready to work,

00:11:56.889 --> 00:12:00.659
Number one, Yang Dong Ik. Thank you.

00:12:01.199 --> 00:12:03.669
- Number one, Yang Dong Ik! - Gong Jeong Han!

00:12:03.669 --> 00:12:04.729
Hello.

00:12:04.729 --> 00:12:08.969
- Number 2, Gong Jeong Han! - Number 1, Yang Dong Ik!

00:12:09.039 --> 00:12:11.539
- Gong Jeong Han! Number two! - Yang Dong Ik!

00:12:11.609 --> 00:12:15.009
All right, to all our elders! If you elect me...

00:12:15.079 --> 00:12:17.609
Unfair contracts and rent-fixing schemes.

00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:20.879
I will personally put a stop to them!

00:12:21.079 --> 00:12:22.689
(Empathetic Leadership for the Merchants of Onjeong Market)

00:12:22.749 --> 00:12:25.249
Hello, young business owners!

00:12:25.519 --> 00:12:29.089
We'll bring in a youth mall! We'll build a food court!

00:12:29.259 --> 00:12:31.329
That is my promise to you!

00:12:31.989 --> 00:12:35.659
Are you trying to divide us? In Candidate Bucket's head,

00:12:35.729 --> 00:12:38.299
is there no concept of mutual growth and cooperation?

00:12:38.369 --> 00:12:42.399
If we stagnate with no progress and the market goes under,

00:12:42.469 --> 00:12:44.069
are you going to be the one to take responsibility?

00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:47.339
What do you mean, "go under?" It only goes under if you win.

00:12:47.409 --> 00:12:49.679
What did you say? You little punk! Are you done talking?

00:12:49.749 --> 00:12:52.849
- I'm done. What will you do? - You jerk! Come here!

00:12:52.919 --> 00:12:54.579
- This guy, I swear... - Oh, no!

00:12:58.489 --> 00:13:00.359
Why don't you just run your clinic? You jerk!

00:13:01.419 --> 00:13:03.429
- Oh, no. Hey! - Why, you little...

00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:06.829
- All right, both of you... - Hey!

00:13:07.429 --> 00:13:08.929
- Hey! - That's enough!

00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:11.229
- I've had it with this guy. - Bring it on!

00:13:11.229 --> 00:13:12.799
Please, just calm down. Stop!

00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:14.699
- Let go! Let go of me! - Hey!

00:13:18.109 --> 00:13:21.309
- Man, what a day. - Hello.

00:13:21.379 --> 00:13:22.809
Hello.

00:13:25.479 --> 00:13:27.149
You look exhausted.

00:13:27.579 --> 00:13:29.619
Your blood sugar must be low. Here, have this to recharge.

00:13:30.049 --> 00:13:31.319
Oh, thank you.

00:13:35.019 --> 00:13:37.459
I thought it was your day off, but you're here.

00:13:37.929 --> 00:13:39.599
A good fight is the best show in town.

00:13:40.399 --> 00:13:43.799
You're the one having a tough time, Officer Jung.

00:13:44.499 --> 00:13:47.899
Not at all. I'm having a great time these days.

00:13:48.639 --> 00:13:52.609
Compared to my last post, this is... It's a lot more dynamic.

00:13:53.009 --> 00:13:54.609
Where were you stationed before?

00:13:55.309 --> 00:13:56.309
Jirisan National Park.

00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:57.949
Wow.

00:13:58.349 --> 00:14:00.619
- Hello. - Hello. Yes, vote for number two.

00:14:00.619 --> 00:14:02.149
- Hello. Oh, my! - My gosh.

00:14:02.149 --> 00:14:05.019
- Hello. - Hello.

00:14:05.119 --> 00:14:09.659
- You'll vote for number two, right? - Of course. You've got my support!

00:14:09.729 --> 00:14:10.729
Yes, I got this.

00:14:10.859 --> 00:14:15.559
Doctor, you've gotten even prettier since you were on TV.

00:14:15.629 --> 00:14:16.799
Can I get your autograph?

00:14:16.869 --> 00:14:20.799
Can I get a photo with you? So I can hang it up in my shop.

00:14:21.839 --> 00:14:23.169
- But on one condition... - Yes?

00:14:23.169 --> 00:14:26.139
You must promise to vote for him. Every vote matters.

00:14:26.139 --> 00:14:27.709
- My goodness. Of course! - You got it.

00:14:30.379 --> 00:14:32.919
- Let's take a picture together. - All right, picture time!

00:14:32.979 --> 00:14:34.619
- Wait, just a second. - Okay.

00:14:34.919 --> 00:14:37.849
Come on, do that thing once for me. Please?

00:14:38.219 --> 00:14:41.459
- You know, that thing. - Go on, do it for them. Yes,

00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:43.359
- All right, here we go. - Just once.

00:14:44.229 --> 00:14:45.429
- I'm prescribing... - "I'm prescribing..."

00:14:45.489 --> 00:14:48.299
- love. - "love."

00:14:48.299 --> 00:14:49.729
I'm really counting on your support, ma'am.

00:14:49.899 --> 00:14:51.129
- Vote for number one. - One more time.

00:14:51.199 --> 00:14:54.769
- "I'm prescribing love!" - I'm prescribing love!

00:14:54.839 --> 00:14:58.309
That's great. Oh, my.

00:14:58.669 --> 00:15:01.539
- Look at this. - Oh, you're a good photographer.

00:15:01.609 --> 00:15:04.449
Please vote for number 2. Gong Jeong Han. Number 2!

00:15:04.509 --> 00:15:06.009
- Of course. - Yes, number two.

00:15:06.009 --> 00:15:10.449
Hello, everyone. Today at 4pm,

00:15:10.519 --> 00:15:13.419
come to Onjeong Culture Hall. The popular trot singer,

00:15:13.489 --> 00:15:16.789
- Park Tae Chan, will be performing. - What?

00:15:16.859 --> 00:15:18.459
Really? The Park Tae Chan?

00:15:18.529 --> 00:15:21.459
Wait, Park Tae Chan is coming here?

00:15:21.529 --> 00:15:23.869
That's right. Come get an autograph,

00:15:23.929 --> 00:15:25.329
and we'll have tons of free gifts, too.

00:15:25.329 --> 00:15:27.299
- Really? - Wait.

00:15:27.299 --> 00:15:31.609
We also have a performance at 4pm at the Merchants' Association Hall.

00:15:31.609 --> 00:15:33.179
Here, at 4pm?

00:15:33.239 --> 00:15:35.309
- At 4pm? All right. - Yes, at 4pm.

00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:38.209
What performance? Who do you think you're fooling?

00:15:39.619 --> 00:15:42.649
If you think I'm bluffing, come and see for yourself.

00:15:43.019 --> 00:15:45.589
- Yes, I'll see you all at 4pm! - At 4pm, yes.

00:15:45.589 --> 00:15:48.319
- That's right. Thank you. - At 4pm!

00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:50.229
(Onjeong Market Merchants' Association Presidential Election)

00:15:57.169 --> 00:16:02.169
(Featuring Trot King Park Tae Chan! Onjeong Market's Grand Festival!)

00:16:04.509 --> 00:16:05.509
What is this?

00:16:07.139 --> 00:16:08.709
Oh, no!

00:16:09.679 --> 00:16:11.279
Yang Dong Suk!

00:16:16.249 --> 00:16:17.489
Why are there so few people here?

00:16:17.489 --> 00:16:20.219
I was about to ask you that. What were you doing out there...

00:16:20.289 --> 00:16:21.919
that this is the only crowd you could bring in?

00:16:21.919 --> 00:16:24.459
I almost forgot who was running in the election.

00:16:24.529 --> 00:16:26.459
Dr. Han's popularity is through the roof.

00:16:26.529 --> 00:16:28.329
Everyone's taking pictures with her and getting autographs.

00:16:28.729 --> 00:16:31.129
- Way to read the room. - What?

00:16:32.469 --> 00:16:35.399
Where's Father? He should've come to watch the show.

00:16:35.499 --> 00:16:38.269
He said he had to prepare herbs, so he went to the clinic.

00:16:38.939 --> 00:16:40.209
Darn it.

00:16:40.579 --> 00:16:42.409
I spent a fortune to get that singer here,

00:16:42.879 --> 00:16:44.179
so where did everyone go?

00:16:44.779 --> 00:16:48.079
They went to the Merchants' Hall. They have a show there, too.

00:16:48.219 --> 00:16:49.219
What?

00:16:49.589 --> 00:16:53.589
Seriously? They have no money. What big-shot can they afford?

00:16:58.059 --> 00:17:01.299
Here comes Gong Jeong Han

00:17:01.759 --> 00:17:05.099
To hold your hand

00:17:05.399 --> 00:17:08.739
To treat you

00:17:08.969 --> 00:17:12.309
I'll be the cure you need

00:17:12.439 --> 00:17:15.239
When the arteries of communication get clogged

00:17:16.009 --> 00:17:19.379
- And you struggle to breathe - Go, Dae Han!

00:17:19.379 --> 00:17:20.849
- Take a pill of sincerity - Take a pill of sincerity

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:22.419
- Two pills of empathy - Two pills of empathy

00:17:22.679 --> 00:17:26.189
- And there are no side effects - And there are no side effects

00:17:26.289 --> 00:17:29.729
- Here comes Gong Jeong Han - Here comes Gong Jeong Han

00:17:29.789 --> 00:17:33.359
- Onjeong Market's stethoscope - Gong Jeong Han!

00:17:33.429 --> 00:17:36.799
- Onjeong Market's family doctor - Gong Jeong Han!

00:17:36.799 --> 00:17:40.299
- Onjeong Market's daily vitamin - Onjeong Market's daily vitamin

00:17:40.369 --> 00:17:42.269
- Number 2, Gong Jeong Han! - Number 2, Gong Jeong Han!

00:17:42.769 --> 00:17:45.439
Here comes Gong Jeong Han

00:17:46.279 --> 00:17:50.079
After this, he's got to win, right? He just has to.

00:17:50.649 --> 00:17:53.379
I said those exact same words myself once.

00:17:53.949 --> 00:17:55.479
What do you mean? When was that?

00:17:56.149 --> 00:17:57.449
A long time ago.

00:17:58.189 --> 00:17:59.519
My kids' father...

00:17:59.959 --> 00:18:03.329
was the Merchants' Association President here once.

00:18:05.729 --> 00:18:10.699
- This suddenly brings it all back. - And there are no side effects

00:18:10.769 --> 00:18:14.469
- Here comes Gong Jeong Han - Number two!

00:18:14.539 --> 00:18:18.039
- Onjeong Market's stethoscope - Gong Jeong Han!

00:18:18.139 --> 00:18:21.409
- Onjeong Market's family doctor - Gong Jeong Han!

00:18:21.479 --> 00:18:25.009
Onjeong Market's daily vitamin

00:18:25.579 --> 00:18:26.979
Thank you!

00:18:27.249 --> 00:18:29.889
My gosh. We just threw our money away.

00:18:30.189 --> 00:18:32.619
We hired an expensive singer, and not even 50 people showed up.

00:18:33.089 --> 00:18:35.319
Dong Suk. Every single vote counts.

00:18:35.759 --> 00:18:38.559
You should've given me the money. I could've drawn a bigger crowd.

00:18:38.559 --> 00:18:39.659
You're back.

00:18:42.129 --> 00:18:43.129
Oh, my!

00:18:43.729 --> 00:18:47.569
My gosh. Hyun Bin! When did you get here?

00:18:47.639 --> 00:18:48.739
What's all this?

00:18:49.469 --> 00:18:52.669
I dropped Eun Bin off, so I figured I'd show off my skills a bit.

00:18:52.979 --> 00:18:56.139
Hey. You're not like the men in this family.

00:18:56.139 --> 00:18:57.809
Your grandpa and your dad...

00:18:57.879 --> 00:19:00.079
act like the world will end if a man sets foot in the kitchen.

00:19:01.479 --> 00:19:03.689
Eun Bin, hurry up and apologise.

00:19:05.119 --> 00:19:06.119
Who are you?

00:19:06.859 --> 00:19:09.559
What do you mean, who am I? I'm your daughter!

00:19:09.629 --> 00:19:10.689
What daughter?

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:14.359
- You said you weren't my daughter. - Honey, please.

00:19:14.559 --> 00:19:17.499
See? No one in this family is on my side.

00:19:17.569 --> 00:19:20.399
Why is Dad yelling at me when she's the one who messed up?

00:19:20.799 --> 00:19:21.839
Hey...

00:19:22.869 --> 00:19:25.669
Gosh, you can be so harsh.

00:19:26.109 --> 00:19:27.139
What did you say?

00:19:27.779 --> 00:19:29.179
I'll talk to her.

00:19:30.309 --> 00:19:34.549
Everyone, go wash up and change. The food's almost ready.

00:19:34.749 --> 00:19:37.189
Yes. I should call Grandfather, too.

00:19:37.249 --> 00:19:39.589
He has to come try some of our Hyun Bin's cooking.

00:19:39.889 --> 00:19:41.559
Come on, honey. Let's go.

00:19:43.529 --> 00:19:44.889
Hyun Bin.

00:19:45.359 --> 00:19:47.799
You're not sleeping over tonight, are you?

00:19:49.329 --> 00:19:52.929
Auntie, are you worried I'll say I'm moving back in?

00:19:52.999 --> 00:19:53.999
What?

00:19:54.569 --> 00:19:55.899
Well, yes.

00:19:56.709 --> 00:20:00.979
Thanks for being so blunt. I'm worried I'll get kicked out.

00:20:01.409 --> 00:20:03.679
That's not going to happen, so don't you worry.

00:20:04.179 --> 00:20:07.549
I won't be a traditional doctor, so make sure Ji Hu studies hard,

00:20:07.619 --> 00:20:09.319
and make sure he inherits the clinic.

00:20:09.649 --> 00:20:13.889
Wow, my nephew's so direct. You grew up to be so cool.

00:20:14.789 --> 00:20:18.659
Gosh, you used to be a mess of tears when your mom left.

00:20:20.459 --> 00:20:21.459
I guess I was.

00:20:22.299 --> 00:20:24.099
- Thank you. - Of course.

00:20:33.009 --> 00:20:34.179
Ji Hu. Hey, Ji Hu.

00:20:35.479 --> 00:20:39.149
Hyun Bin says he has no plans to take over the clinic.

00:20:39.209 --> 00:20:40.819
He told me to make sure you study hard.

00:20:41.519 --> 00:20:46.049
Mom, you and Dad both work so hard. Can't we just move out?

00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:48.359
We can let Hyun Bin have this room.

00:20:48.419 --> 00:20:51.589
Come on, he said he doesn't want to move in.

00:20:52.989 --> 00:20:55.499
Besides, we don't have the money.

00:20:55.629 --> 00:20:59.869
My income covers our living costs, and the money your dad earns...

00:20:59.939 --> 00:21:02.769
We're saving it for your tutoring and college tuition.

00:21:05.839 --> 00:21:08.639
What if Dad wastes it on stocks or some pyramid scheme again?

00:21:09.809 --> 00:21:11.579
You think he wants to get kicked out by Grandfather?

00:21:12.609 --> 00:21:13.619
Don't worry.

00:21:13.679 --> 00:21:16.619
I'm keeping an eye on everything that comes into your dad's account.

00:21:21.959 --> 00:21:23.019
Honey!

00:21:23.359 --> 00:21:25.959
Hyun Bin has zero intention of moving in.

00:21:26.259 --> 00:21:27.259
Really?

00:21:27.729 --> 00:21:29.429
Why are you so nonchalant?

00:21:29.429 --> 00:21:31.529
You were so worried we might get kicked out.

00:21:32.299 --> 00:21:34.299
- Right. - Oh, that reminds me.

00:21:34.599 --> 00:21:36.369
You have that business trip next week, don't you?

00:21:36.439 --> 00:21:39.979
- Should I pack for you? - I'll do it. Feed me, I'm starving.

00:21:46.719 --> 00:21:47.779
This is delicious.

00:21:50.419 --> 00:21:51.419
Now, this is what I'm talking about.

00:21:52.149 --> 00:21:53.789
This is how spicy braised chicken is supposed to taste.

00:21:54.089 --> 00:21:55.889
It's been a while since I've had it this good.

00:21:56.319 --> 00:21:59.329
In the past, it was so bland,

00:21:59.799 --> 00:22:01.499
I couldn't even tell what I was eating...

00:22:02.429 --> 00:22:03.429
Dad.

00:22:06.269 --> 00:22:07.339
Enjoy.

00:22:08.699 --> 00:22:12.009
Let's be honest. It has been pretty bland, right?

00:22:12.769 --> 00:22:15.379
See? Dong Ik seems to be really enjoying it, too.

00:22:19.249 --> 00:22:22.949
I eat out a lot, so I'm used to more intense flavours.

00:22:23.079 --> 00:22:26.349
- It's so good, restaurant-quality. - I'll be honest.

00:22:28.719 --> 00:22:30.059
I think it's delicious, too.

00:22:31.189 --> 00:22:32.529
It's just so good.

00:22:34.229 --> 00:22:36.129
Father, you're home.

00:22:36.329 --> 00:22:38.699
Father, have a seat. The food is excellent.

00:22:38.799 --> 00:22:40.399
What's a man like him doing in the kitchen?

00:22:41.099 --> 00:22:43.139
Gosh, I knew he'd say something like that.

00:22:43.639 --> 00:22:46.939
Grandfather, most of the best chefs are men.

00:22:47.109 --> 00:22:51.079
That stone-age view isn't just outdated. It's rude.

00:22:51.149 --> 00:22:52.209
What was that?

00:22:52.649 --> 00:22:56.349
Here, try the spicy braised chicken this man made.

00:22:56.649 --> 00:23:00.459
Yes. Come on, Father, have a seat. It's honestly so good.

00:23:00.519 --> 00:23:02.159
No, that's okay. I don't have an appetite.

00:23:02.219 --> 00:23:05.959
Come on. Just have one bite. Come on, Father.

00:23:12.669 --> 00:23:13.669
Just try it.

00:23:36.259 --> 00:23:37.629
Man, I was so nervous.

00:23:38.589 --> 00:23:40.999
- What a relief. - Tell me about it.

00:23:41.699 --> 00:23:42.699
Right, honey?

00:23:44.229 --> 00:23:45.899
Oh, I'm exhausted.

00:23:46.799 --> 00:23:47.839
I see.

00:23:48.969 --> 00:23:50.669
Come to the clinic the day after tomorrow.

00:23:50.669 --> 00:23:51.839
We'll take my car.

00:23:52.239 --> 00:23:53.239
Okay.

00:23:55.439 --> 00:23:58.509
Director Song will be there to discuss the show's concept.

00:23:59.179 --> 00:24:01.849
It's been a while, hasn't it? Hey, Seong Mi.

00:24:02.419 --> 00:24:04.419
Rub my feet for me.

00:24:05.389 --> 00:24:06.419
Are you crazy?

00:24:06.419 --> 00:24:08.619
What's crazy about giving your husband a foot massage?

00:24:08.689 --> 00:24:11.389
The problem isn't your feet. It's your attitude.

00:24:11.659 --> 00:24:14.059
You've been walking around all day, you haven't even washed your feet,

00:24:14.129 --> 00:24:16.499
and yet you demand I rub them as if you're entitled to it.

00:24:16.729 --> 00:24:19.939
And when I say no, you blame me. That attitude.

00:24:20.769 --> 00:24:24.209
That right there is emotional abuse and gaslighting.

00:24:24.339 --> 00:24:27.179
Fine, I guess I am crazy then. You're right.

00:24:27.579 --> 00:24:30.509
Oh, boy. I'll just rub my own feet.

00:24:32.109 --> 00:24:34.919
Where are you off to? Going to sleep in Mom's room again?

00:24:35.079 --> 00:24:36.689
I'm sleeping in Ju Ah's room. Why?

00:24:36.949 --> 00:24:41.089
Come on. We were campaigning today, holding hands and everything,

00:24:41.159 --> 00:24:43.629
with our arms around each other, so I just thought...

00:24:44.029 --> 00:24:46.159
that maybe we could, you know...

00:24:46.859 --> 00:24:49.529
I thought we'd be sleeping together. What? Why? What's with that look?

00:24:50.429 --> 00:24:52.229
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:24:52.599 --> 00:24:55.699
This is purely a strategic alliance.

00:24:56.139 --> 00:24:58.969
Once we get paid for the apartment and your brother's family moves out,

00:24:59.369 --> 00:25:00.579
we're sleeping in separate rooms.

00:25:01.979 --> 00:25:06.279
I bet Bucket's wife rubs his feet for him,

00:25:06.349 --> 00:25:08.719
and I'm sure they share the same bed just fine.

00:25:09.119 --> 00:25:13.289
- Do you want to die? - No, forget it. Good night.

00:25:13.989 --> 00:25:15.089
Oh, boy...

00:25:18.089 --> 00:25:19.759
Good grief.

00:25:33.339 --> 00:25:35.909
Wait, what are you doing, Doctor?

00:25:36.639 --> 00:25:38.079
I'm going to sleep. Turn off the light.

00:25:38.579 --> 00:25:41.079
You moved out of the studio to stop the rumours.

00:25:41.079 --> 00:25:43.179
So, shouldn't you be sharing a room with your husband?

00:25:43.319 --> 00:25:45.149
Quiet. Turn off the light.

00:25:45.249 --> 00:25:48.859
Excuse me? Ms. Love Evangelist. Is your marriage all for show?

00:25:49.159 --> 00:25:51.029
Wow, you're such a hypocrite.

00:25:52.589 --> 00:25:53.599
Hey.

00:25:53.929 --> 00:25:56.929
By any chance, is Woo Jae dating Bucket's daughter?

00:25:57.129 --> 00:25:58.669
Gosh, as if.

00:25:58.969 --> 00:26:01.369
She just has a crush on him and follows him everywhere.

00:26:01.569 --> 00:26:02.799
Even if it were the greatest romance,

00:26:02.799 --> 00:26:04.109
it's absolutely out of the question.

00:26:05.439 --> 00:26:07.479
You're sure Woo Jae isn't interested in her, right?

00:26:08.009 --> 00:26:09.839
That's what he said.

00:26:09.839 --> 00:26:12.679
But what's with that family? Are we like a magnet for them?

00:26:13.519 --> 00:26:16.079
Didn't Dr. Yang have a thing for you, too?

00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:19.689
That's not all. Bucket's son had a crush on you, too.

00:26:21.459 --> 00:26:24.259
Wait, you knew about that?

00:26:24.859 --> 00:26:25.989
Of course. Did you think I wouldn't?

00:26:26.289 --> 00:26:28.759
Your grandma and uncle may have raised you,

00:26:28.759 --> 00:26:32.369
but I'm the one who gave birth to you and breastfed you.

00:26:33.699 --> 00:26:35.699
I might let you get away with quitting medicine,

00:26:35.839 --> 00:26:39.069
but there is no way you're deciding who you marry.

00:26:39.139 --> 00:26:43.449
How did we even get on this topic? I don't even have a boyfriend, Mom.

00:26:43.779 --> 00:26:45.409
My goodness.

00:26:45.879 --> 00:26:49.279
Just imagine that woman as your mother-in-law.

00:26:49.479 --> 00:26:51.619
How horrible would that be?

00:26:52.019 --> 00:26:55.959
If you analyse her typical behaviour,

00:26:56.689 --> 00:26:59.129
it's highly likely she views her son...

00:26:59.189 --> 00:27:02.199
as a means of psychological compensation...

00:27:03.059 --> 00:27:04.699
Hey, I'm talking here!

00:27:05.469 --> 00:27:06.969
Just go to sleep, please.

00:27:08.599 --> 00:27:10.469
Gosh, this kid.

00:27:15.109 --> 00:27:17.679
I'm so stuffed. That was delicious.

00:27:19.279 --> 00:27:20.749
You liked it that much?

00:27:21.019 --> 00:27:22.019
I did.

00:27:22.519 --> 00:27:26.219
It was the first meal cooked for me since I married into this family.

00:27:28.019 --> 00:27:29.089
No way.

00:27:29.859 --> 00:27:31.859
Well, I'll cook for you more often then.

00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:36.359
I'm already jealous.

00:27:36.829 --> 00:27:39.969
The woman who gets to marry my son is so lucky.

00:27:41.039 --> 00:27:45.609
- I don't plan on getting married. - What? Why not?

00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:48.309
Is this one of those new trends, choosing to be single or something?

00:27:48.639 --> 00:27:51.949
Marriage isn't just between two people.

00:27:52.049 --> 00:27:54.479
It's about 2 families becoming 1, you know?

00:27:56.049 --> 00:28:00.659
That's not how it is anymore. All that matters is your happiness.

00:28:01.489 --> 00:28:04.589
Our family is honestly embarrassing. A total embarrassment.

00:28:06.429 --> 00:28:07.429
Me, too?

00:28:08.759 --> 00:28:09.799
Well...

00:28:10.599 --> 00:28:13.739
A mother-in-law this young, pretty, and perfect...

00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:16.569
It'd probably be a bit intimidating for the daughter-in-law, right?

00:28:20.939 --> 00:28:21.939
I...

00:28:22.879 --> 00:28:24.279
I did something terrible, Hyun Bin.

00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:27.749
You heard from Eun Bin, didn't you?

00:28:28.819 --> 00:28:29.819
Yes.

00:28:30.419 --> 00:28:32.549
I understand why you did it, but...

00:28:33.319 --> 00:28:34.689
you went a little too far.

00:28:36.959 --> 00:28:37.959
Fair enough.

00:28:39.659 --> 00:28:42.359
But hey, it's not like Eun Bin is blameless in this either.

00:28:42.429 --> 00:28:46.429
She's crazy about that guy, so she ran to tattle to his family.

00:28:46.699 --> 00:28:50.739
- She's crazy about some guy? - Yes. The doctor's son.

00:28:50.809 --> 00:28:54.079
It's driving me crazy! She's completely obsessed with him.

00:28:55.639 --> 00:28:58.849
- You don't like that? - "Don't like" is an understatement.

00:28:59.709 --> 00:29:02.919
It can never happen. No, absolutely, never, ever.

00:29:13.159 --> 00:29:15.229
Don't tell me he was your first love, too.

00:29:18.169 --> 00:29:21.639
It's already been a year since you went to study abroad.

00:29:22.439 --> 00:29:25.569
You told me not to forget, but I guess you forgot about me.

00:29:26.209 --> 00:29:27.679
I'll be waiting to hear from you.

00:29:28.579 --> 00:29:31.109
I miss you, Yang Hyun Bin.

00:29:42.859 --> 00:29:45.629
All right, everyone.

00:29:45.829 --> 00:29:49.029
The vote for the 16th President of the Merchants' Association...

00:29:49.099 --> 00:29:51.669
will now begin.

00:29:52.269 --> 00:29:53.269
(The 16th Onjeong Market Merchants' Association Presidential Election)

00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:54.269
(Number 2, Gong Jeong Han)

00:29:54.269 --> 00:29:58.409
All right. Let the candidates vote first.

00:29:58.769 --> 00:30:00.339
(Number 2, Gong Jeong Han)

00:30:01.079 --> 00:30:02.539
(Number 1, Yang Dong Ik)

00:30:09.119 --> 00:30:12.089
Only people with a business license can vote, right?

00:30:12.189 --> 00:30:15.789
Yes. We get a vote, and so do they.

00:30:19.559 --> 00:30:20.999
Woo Jae.

00:30:26.899 --> 00:30:28.469
(Ballot Box)

00:30:33.639 --> 00:30:35.039
Get out of the way.

00:30:36.409 --> 00:30:37.479
I was here first.

00:30:45.389 --> 00:30:46.389
Honey.

00:30:55.559 --> 00:30:59.829
- This is so embarrassing. - I wish this were over.

00:30:59.899 --> 00:31:01.169
(Onjeong Market Merchants' Association)

00:31:01.939 --> 00:31:04.969
Excuse me, who did you vote for?

00:31:07.309 --> 00:31:09.539
Oh, thank you so much.

00:31:11.649 --> 00:31:13.079
That's two votes for us already.

00:31:13.279 --> 00:31:16.019
I bet the next person voted for my brother.

00:31:17.119 --> 00:31:18.149
No.

00:31:19.689 --> 00:31:20.759
Dad, are you leaving?

00:31:24.929 --> 00:31:26.229
Get home safe.

00:31:31.369 --> 00:31:32.369
(Yang Dong Ik, Gong Jeong Han)

00:31:32.669 --> 00:31:33.999
Gong Jeong Han.

00:31:42.879 --> 00:31:44.509
(Number 1 Yang Dong Ik, Number 2 Gong Jeong Han)

00:31:48.979 --> 00:31:50.419
Yang Dong Ik.

00:31:54.689 --> 00:31:55.759
Yes!

00:32:01.459 --> 00:32:03.729
I don't know why I'm so nervous about this.

00:32:06.929 --> 00:32:10.069
The people who promised us votes. They came through, right?

00:32:10.139 --> 00:32:12.539
Of course. We're going to win.

00:32:12.609 --> 00:32:14.839
- Don't you worry, dear. - Okay.

00:32:16.809 --> 00:32:19.379
It's too close to call.

00:32:22.419 --> 00:32:23.989
Gong Jeong Han.

00:32:26.119 --> 00:32:28.789
- Yang Dong Ik. - My goodness.

00:32:31.029 --> 00:32:32.159
(Yang Dong Ik, Gong Jeong Han)

00:32:32.229 --> 00:32:35.729
Yang Dong Ik. Gong Jeong Han.

00:32:38.129 --> 00:32:42.139
Yang Dong Ik, Gong Jeong Han. Yang Dong Ik.

00:32:42.869 --> 00:32:44.139
Gong Jeong Han.

00:32:56.179 --> 00:32:59.749
All right, with both candidates tied,

00:33:00.319 --> 00:33:02.459
it all comes down to this last vote.

00:33:18.139 --> 00:33:21.309
I will now announce the results of the 16th...

00:33:21.379 --> 00:33:24.579
Merchants' Association Presidential Election.

00:33:26.309 --> 00:33:29.849
Out of the 175 eligible voters,

00:33:30.019 --> 00:33:33.149

The Merchants' Association Election Committee.

00:34:13.859 --> 00:34:15.029
Thank you.

Yes.

Come on, get up. Thank you!

I'll work hard for all of you.

00:34:41.559 --> 00:34:43.159
- This is amazing. - Thank you!

00:34:43.219 --> 00:34:44.229
Congratulations, really!

00:34:51.729 --> 00:34:53.029
You ran a good race.

00:35:01.009 --> 00:35:02.809
- Hey, Dong Suk. - What?

00:35:05.009 --> 00:35:07.679
- Seriously, let go! - Neener!

00:35:09.019 --> 00:35:11.119
- You worked so hard! - You worked hard, too.

00:35:11.189 --> 00:35:12.619
- Well done. - Congratulations!

00:35:13.149 --> 00:35:15.359
- Thank you. - Thank you so much!

00:35:15.759 --> 00:35:17.489
You worked hard.

00:35:19.489 --> 00:35:20.489
Right.

00:35:23.159 --> 00:35:24.169
Well...

00:35:25.199 --> 00:35:26.529
Congratulations.

00:35:36.239 --> 00:35:41.149
You said you were the bigger person, but you look like you got revenge.

00:35:41.319 --> 00:35:44.319
This isn't revenge. It's a righteous victory.

00:35:44.849 --> 00:35:48.559
- Is it that sweet? - It's absolutely delicious.

00:35:50.419 --> 00:35:52.659
Whatever. Let's go.

00:35:59.029 --> 00:36:01.339
I'm going to head inside and rest.

00:36:04.769 --> 00:36:06.769
After all her big talk... Unbelievable.

00:36:07.379 --> 00:36:09.039
How much money did we waste on this?

00:36:10.009 --> 00:36:11.109
What happened?

00:36:11.549 --> 00:36:13.649
We lost. By a single vote.

00:36:13.909 --> 00:36:16.879
- One vote? - Yes. It's so frustrating!

00:36:17.079 --> 00:36:19.519
That last vote should have been ours.

00:36:20.519 --> 00:36:23.389
Quick, get me some water. I need to take my medicine.

00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:26.929
Wait a second.

00:36:27.259 --> 00:36:29.999
- They counted from the top. - So what?

00:36:30.299 --> 00:36:34.039
So the last vote they counted was from the first person to vote?

00:36:34.199 --> 00:36:37.839
Wait... You and Dad voted first, didn't you?

00:36:37.909 --> 00:36:39.039
You did vote for yourself, right?

00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:41.409
Hey, what kind of question is that? Stop talking nonsense,

00:36:41.479 --> 00:36:42.779
and go get Dad his water.

00:36:43.039 --> 00:36:46.949
That one vote is a shame, isn't it? You get him the water.

00:36:47.819 --> 00:36:48.819
The nerve of this girl.

00:36:51.549 --> 00:36:52.919
- Hey, you! - Sorry.

(Always Kind Pharmacy, Gong Myeong Jeong Dae Han Clinic)

00:37:13.639 --> 00:37:16.109
Mom, it's cold. Hey, let's hurry. Okay?

00:37:16.679 --> 00:37:18.679
- Yes. - Oh, hello.

00:37:21.019 --> 00:37:25.689
(Gong Myeong Jeong Dae Han Clinic, Sunny Korean Medicine Clinic)

00:37:30.789 --> 00:37:32.889
- My goodness! Sir! - Oh, no!

00:37:39.899 --> 00:37:42.539
Gosh, your blood pressure is high.

00:37:43.369 --> 00:37:46.509
But at least you're conscious, and your breathing is stable.

00:37:47.269 --> 00:37:50.309
It looks like a blood sugar issue, so I'll run a blood test first.

00:37:50.379 --> 00:37:52.409
- Hey, I'll... - Yes?

00:37:52.479 --> 00:37:54.119
- I'll call his family. - Okay.

00:37:54.179 --> 00:37:56.949
No! Don't bother!

00:37:57.889 --> 00:38:00.689
I have high blood sugar.

00:38:01.089 --> 00:38:03.159
Oh, what about your medication?

00:38:03.759 --> 00:38:07.189
- Have you been taking it? - Yes, after my last check-up,

00:38:08.099 --> 00:38:10.029
I just took the one prescription, and that was it.

00:38:10.929 --> 00:38:13.799
Let me start you on an IV to stabilize your electrolytes.

00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:16.969
Mom, please put that big pillow under his legs.

00:38:17.439 --> 00:38:20.509
And I'll write a prescription, so please get the medicine ready.

00:38:20.509 --> 00:38:22.839
- Okay, I got it. - Yes, just hang on a moment, sir.

- Hey, Mom. - Yes.

00:38:51.609 --> 00:38:52.839
Whether I lived or died,

00:38:54.709 --> 00:38:56.879
why didn't you just leave me on the street?

00:38:57.409 --> 00:39:00.409
What? Why would I do that? I'm a doctor.

00:39:00.779 --> 00:39:03.249
You must hate the very sight of me.

00:39:03.519 --> 00:39:07.589
I see you from my window constantly. If I hated the sight of you,

00:39:07.589 --> 00:39:09.559
I would've moved my clinic a long time ago.

00:39:10.659 --> 00:39:11.659
You must have it tough.

00:39:14.229 --> 00:39:15.729
I'm sorry about that.

00:39:16.259 --> 00:39:18.129
Sir, why would you say that?

00:39:18.969 --> 00:39:21.499
What have you and I ever done wrong?

00:39:23.539 --> 00:39:24.539
Here.

Jeong Han's prescription and your blood sugar supplements.

00:39:29.279 --> 00:39:33.979
Don't skip meals. And be careful with sweets and fruit.

00:39:34.779 --> 00:39:38.189
And if I see you buying street food at the market again,

00:39:38.389 --> 00:39:40.019
I'm calling your family.

00:39:40.449 --> 00:39:41.459
Yes, ma'am.

00:39:42.719 --> 00:39:44.189
No matter how old we get,

00:39:44.559 --> 00:39:46.689
our children still need their parents.

00:39:47.529 --> 00:39:50.729
Isn't that why we've both endured for so long?

00:39:51.669 --> 00:39:54.699
So you have to stay healthy for a long time.

00:39:55.569 --> 00:39:56.569
Right.

00:39:56.739 --> 00:40:00.339
I'm open weekend evenings every other week, so please come by.

00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:02.409
And if you really don't want to see me,

00:40:02.779 --> 00:40:05.649
at least go to another clinic to get your prescription filled.

00:40:05.949 --> 00:40:08.849
I will be sure to repay you for saving my life.

00:40:09.749 --> 00:40:13.049
What? And how exactly do you plan on repaying me?

00:40:13.549 --> 00:40:14.559
Tomorrow.

00:40:15.919 --> 00:40:16.989
I'm going to vote for you.

00:40:18.129 --> 00:40:21.459
- Good grief. - Please, you don't have to.

00:40:27.469 --> 00:40:29.999
You'd better know you won because of me, you punk.

00:40:30.939 --> 00:40:32.139
Dad, I'm coming in.

00:40:35.679 --> 00:40:36.679
Wait a minute.

00:40:37.279 --> 00:40:38.309
What's this medicine you're taking?

00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:40.109
They're just vitamins.

00:40:42.219 --> 00:40:45.249
We have good herbs at the clinic. Why would you take vitamins?

00:40:46.049 --> 00:40:47.319
It's too much of a hassle to brew them.

00:40:48.219 --> 00:40:51.559
Gosh, losing by one vote... It's so frustrating, I could die.

00:40:51.859 --> 00:40:52.859
What's so frustrating?

00:40:53.789 --> 00:40:55.799
He must have been better than you at something.

00:40:56.399 --> 00:40:57.399
Dad, don't tell me...

00:40:58.029 --> 00:40:59.569
You didn't vote for Jeong Han, did you?

00:41:01.569 --> 00:41:03.299
- You didn't, right? - Quiet!

00:41:04.199 --> 00:41:05.909
Throw all of this out.

00:41:06.939 --> 00:41:09.179
What? Seriously?

00:41:09.679 --> 00:41:12.649
I told you, but you never listened. Why the sudden change of heart?

00:41:12.879 --> 00:41:14.419
I told you to throw it out, so just do it!

Jeong Han's father.

00:41:28.729 --> 00:41:31.029
Jeong Han has become the president of the Merchants' Association.

00:41:32.199 --> 00:41:33.199
Just like you.

00:41:41.409 --> 00:41:45.949
He has your warm, considerate heart.

00:41:49.479 --> 00:41:52.389
He doesn't say it, but deep in his heart,

00:41:52.689 --> 00:41:56.359
I know he resents you, but also misses you dearly.

00:42:02.599 --> 00:42:05.969
Mr. Yang came to see Jeong Han for treatment.

00:42:07.569 --> 00:42:10.339
He's aged so much, just as I have.

00:42:14.139 --> 00:42:16.479
As more time passes, I hope that one day,

00:42:17.139 --> 00:42:19.949
the resentment they have for each other will subside,

00:42:20.479 --> 00:42:24.419
and these wounded hearts will finally be able to heal.

The door is now open.

00:42:48.909 --> 00:42:51.479
- Good morning, Ms. Gong. - Oh, hello...

00:42:52.909 --> 00:42:54.449
Did you have a good weekend?

Yes.

My goodness.

00:43:19.769 --> 00:43:21.009
A vitamin drink.

00:43:21.579 --> 00:43:22.879
I'll bring you one every day.

00:43:23.909 --> 00:43:26.649
- Why? - No reason. I just want to.

00:43:39.029 --> 00:43:42.129
What? The Design Office is this way. Why is she going over there?

00:43:42.929 --> 00:43:44.629
- Ms. Gong... - Hey, don't call her.

00:43:45.269 --> 00:43:46.269
Why?

00:43:47.229 --> 00:43:48.239
This is going to be interesting.

00:43:54.479 --> 00:43:57.809
We only spent a few days together. Why do I feel so empty?

Let's see.

00:44:11.429 --> 00:44:13.989
Great, now I'm seeing things.

00:44:14.659 --> 00:44:17.059
Gong Ju Ah is back in the Design Office.

00:44:17.459 --> 00:44:18.669
There's no way she'd be here.

00:44:20.869 --> 00:44:21.869
Right!

00:44:23.639 --> 00:44:24.969
Why am I here?

00:44:25.469 --> 00:44:26.469
Excuse me?

00:44:29.209 --> 00:44:30.539
Gosh, where is my head?

00:44:31.479 --> 00:44:33.679
I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

00:44:34.519 --> 00:44:36.249
Wait, Ms. Gong.

00:44:36.849 --> 00:44:37.989
Please don't make fun of me.

00:44:38.749 --> 00:44:40.589
This is embarrassing enough already.

00:44:43.719 --> 00:44:45.089
No, it's not that.

00:44:46.789 --> 00:44:50.229
I wanted to say I had a great time with my family, thanks to you.

00:44:51.329 --> 00:44:53.129
Okay. Yes.

00:44:53.899 --> 00:44:54.899
I'm glad to hear that.

00:44:55.899 --> 00:44:56.899
I'll be going.

00:45:13.849 --> 00:45:18.059
You jerk! Why didn't you tell me? I made a complete fool of myself!

00:45:18.289 --> 00:45:22.299
Don't blame me. It was your instinct pulling you toward him.

00:45:22.359 --> 00:45:24.299
Seriously, shut it.

00:45:32.369 --> 00:45:34.269
- Ms. Kim? - Yes.

00:45:34.269 --> 00:45:36.079
I'll attend the Design Team's workshop as well.

00:45:36.739 --> 00:45:38.679
Postpone any meetings I have and clear my schedule.

00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:40.109
Understood.

00:45:47.719 --> 00:45:49.419
You're packing already? We haven't even found a new place.

00:45:49.889 --> 00:45:53.329
Yes. Seong Mi said she's getting the final payment tomorrow,

00:45:53.389 --> 00:45:54.389
so we need to be ready.

00:45:55.799 --> 00:45:57.459
- Honey, come sit down. - What?

00:45:59.399 --> 00:46:03.499
Once we move, let's invite the aunt who raised you to come visit.

00:46:04.499 --> 00:46:07.709
No, forget it. If I see her, we'll just end up fighting.

00:46:08.309 --> 00:46:11.449
She tried marrying me to a rich old man for a quick buck,

00:46:11.609 --> 00:46:15.449
so she's still fuming that I ran away and ruined her plan.

00:46:16.879 --> 00:46:19.989
Still, I'm actually grateful to that man and your aunt.

00:46:20.489 --> 00:46:21.719
Thanks to them,

00:46:22.159 --> 00:46:23.919
you found your way to Onjeong and met me.

00:46:25.689 --> 00:46:27.129
Dae Han, let's go.

00:46:27.489 --> 00:46:29.129
Okay, I'll be right out.

00:46:29.859 --> 00:46:31.599
Honey, things are about to get even busier for me.

00:46:31.999 --> 00:46:32.999
See you later.

00:46:38.669 --> 00:46:40.269
- I'm heading out. - Okay.

00:46:41.239 --> 00:46:42.239
Jeong Han!

00:46:43.679 --> 00:46:47.049
All right, let's begin the Onjeong Market warm-up!

00:46:47.149 --> 00:46:50.179
One, two, three, four,

00:46:50.519 --> 00:46:53.049
five, six, seven, eight.

00:46:53.389 --> 00:46:56.019
Two, two, three, four,

five, six, seven, eight.

00:46:59.189 --> 00:47:02.929
Make a nice heart over your head. That's it.

00:47:02.999 --> 00:47:03.999
Now, to the left.

00:47:04.329 --> 00:47:06.899
- One, two, three, four. - One, two, three, four.

00:47:07.169 --> 00:47:12.069
We love Onjeong Market! Two, two, three, four.

00:47:12.469 --> 00:47:15.409
- Let's make it big, Onjeong Market! - Let's make it big, Onjeong Market!

00:47:15.509 --> 00:47:19.679
- Okay. Face the front again. - Gosh, the noise is killing me.

00:47:20.179 --> 00:47:22.649
He's making such a scene, acting like a complete fool.

00:47:23.479 --> 00:47:26.219
Is he really doing this every day? For the next three years?

00:47:26.749 --> 00:47:27.919
It was one of his campaign pledges.

00:47:28.389 --> 00:47:31.289
- If he says he'll do it, he will. - Oh, gosh.

00:47:31.959 --> 00:47:35.129
So is your shot at the City Council over then?

00:47:35.559 --> 00:47:36.799
Didn't you have to become president...

00:47:36.799 --> 00:47:38.399
of the Merchants' Association to be nominated?

00:47:38.669 --> 00:47:40.699
Your sister-in-law is taking care of everything.

00:47:41.999 --> 00:47:44.069
- So what's her plan now? - Onjeong Market!

00:47:45.009 --> 00:47:46.909
Here. This is for you.

00:47:48.109 --> 00:47:51.239
The moment I saw this scarf at the department store,

00:47:51.779 --> 00:47:56.149
I just knew it would be the perfect colour on you.

00:47:57.219 --> 00:47:59.849
Sweetie, you must've heard that my husband and I...

00:48:00.289 --> 00:48:02.019
are getting together for golf with Mr. Hwang and his wife.

00:48:04.189 --> 00:48:06.789
If you could just arrange for us to meet,

00:48:07.289 --> 00:48:10.159
I'll make it well worth your while.

00:48:10.729 --> 00:48:12.729
I heard he lost the Merchants' Association election.

00:48:12.999 --> 00:48:14.899
Bringing up the nomination in this situation...

00:48:15.499 --> 00:48:17.499
would put Mr. Hwang in an awkward spot.

00:48:17.969 --> 00:48:20.309
Appearances and justification are very important to him.

00:48:21.639 --> 00:48:23.609
It was only by a single vote, you know.

00:48:24.009 --> 00:48:28.719
With a small margin, we can turn opinion before the nomination.

00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:33.089
Well, I feel bad taking this for nothing.

00:48:34.419 --> 00:48:36.119
So how about I give you a little tip?

00:48:38.129 --> 00:48:39.129
A tip?

00:48:40.429 --> 00:48:42.829
I wonder what she wants today.

00:48:43.159 --> 00:48:47.769
I let my family brand me as disloyal to save your mother...

00:48:47.869 --> 00:48:51.609
and helped your dad win his race. You can't just let that slide.

00:48:51.769 --> 00:48:55.439
Your dad only won the election because of my noble sacrifice.

00:48:55.579 --> 00:48:58.379
- Right? - Sure, let's go with that.

00:48:58.809 --> 00:48:59.809
Thanks.

00:49:00.049 --> 00:49:04.679
Grant me one wish. If you refuse, I'll show up every single day.

00:49:05.219 --> 00:49:06.219
What's your wish?

00:49:07.349 --> 00:49:08.519
Go on a date with me.

00:49:08.919 --> 00:49:11.729
We can wear matching outfits, eat malatang,

00:49:11.789 --> 00:49:15.799
see a movie, take some photos, and go to a cafe for dessert.

00:49:15.899 --> 00:49:17.399
And I refuse to take no for an answer.

00:49:19.269 --> 00:49:20.699
Fine. Let's do it.

00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:26.009
- Really? - But we can't tell our families.

00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:27.239
Got it.

00:49:27.869 --> 00:49:28.879
Promise!

00:49:31.139 --> 00:49:32.149
Promise.

00:49:32.679 --> 00:49:34.009
I'm so happy.

00:49:37.619 --> 00:49:39.449
So when are we doing this?

00:49:44.359 --> 00:49:47.029
Are you sure it's okay for me to get free food like this so often?

00:49:47.089 --> 00:49:50.899
It's fine. They're not from me. They're gifts from our patients.

00:49:51.259 --> 00:49:52.399
I see.

00:49:53.069 --> 00:49:55.069
So why are you eating here today?

00:49:55.969 --> 00:49:58.769
Dr. Gong has a meeting with the Merchants' Association.

00:49:58.869 --> 00:50:01.169
Ms. Na went to view the new house Mr. Gong is moving into.

00:50:01.879 --> 00:50:02.879
I see.

00:50:04.279 --> 00:50:05.949
So Mr. Gong is moving.

00:50:06.209 --> 00:50:08.779
Yes, they've been married for five years and are moving out.

00:50:10.079 --> 00:50:13.719
They're already such a great couple. They'll get even closer now.

00:50:13.849 --> 00:50:15.189
I know, right?

00:50:15.189 --> 00:50:18.559
Clinic manager and his wife, married for five years.

00:50:18.889 --> 00:50:21.529
A happy couple, planning to move out.

00:50:22.459 --> 00:50:23.829
You really write down everything, don't you?

00:50:23.999 --> 00:50:26.129
I bet he wrote about you in there too, Nurse Oh.

00:50:26.399 --> 00:50:28.129
- Me? - Yes.

00:50:29.639 --> 00:50:31.199
- What does it say? - Hey! You can't see.

00:50:31.509 --> 00:50:33.069
- Why not? - No way!

00:50:33.139 --> 00:50:34.939
I have a right to see what you wrote. Right, Chief?

00:50:35.009 --> 00:50:38.279
- Sir, that's classified. - Come on! Isn't this illegal?

00:50:38.409 --> 00:50:40.179
- That was close. - It's classified.

00:50:40.249 --> 00:50:41.249
- Eat up. - Come on.

00:50:44.219 --> 00:50:47.019
- Please, feel free to look around. - Okay.

00:50:49.989 --> 00:50:52.659
- The balcony is so spacious. - Yes, it is.

00:50:54.189 --> 00:50:56.629
- So, this is the master bedroom? - Yes, that's right.

00:50:57.999 --> 00:51:02.139
The layout is so good, it looks more spacious than it is.

00:51:03.139 --> 00:51:05.539
You certainly have a good eye, ma'am.

00:51:05.809 --> 00:51:08.709
This unit is south-facing, so it gets plenty of sunlight.

00:51:08.879 --> 00:51:12.209
Mom, the hot water works great, and the pressure is strong, too.

00:51:13.409 --> 00:51:16.419
But shouldn't Hui Gyeong be the one to see it and decide?

00:51:17.079 --> 00:51:18.149
Don't worry about Hui Gyeong.

00:51:18.489 --> 00:51:20.319
She said she'll love anything you pick out, Mom.

00:51:20.989 --> 00:51:23.659
Goodness. Aren't you just excited to be living alone with her?

00:51:24.089 --> 00:51:25.089
You think so?

00:51:26.029 --> 00:51:27.029
I guess that must be it.

00:51:28.059 --> 00:51:30.529
The place is vacant,

00:51:30.759 --> 00:51:34.029
- so can they move in anytime? - Absolutely.

00:51:34.429 --> 00:51:36.039
Let's go sign the contract, shall we?

00:51:36.339 --> 00:51:37.469
Okay. Sure.

00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:39.309
Come, this way.

00:51:52.349 --> 00:51:54.249
Mom, what's this? Are you buying something?

00:51:54.689 --> 00:51:58.089
Since you're moving, let's get you a new bed. My treat.

00:52:04.399 --> 00:52:08.169
- This is nice and warm. - Mom, come on, you don't have to.

00:52:08.599 --> 00:52:10.299
The one we have is still perfectly fine.

00:52:10.899 --> 00:52:13.039
You're moving into a new home, so you should have new furniture.

00:52:13.509 --> 00:52:15.209
You'll feel like newlyweds again, right?

00:52:22.749 --> 00:52:25.649
Yes. It honestly feels like a dream.

00:52:26.049 --> 00:52:30.289
I'm just so happy our wish came true sooner than we thought, darling.

00:52:32.129 --> 00:52:33.129
My husband?

00:52:34.459 --> 00:52:36.029
Of course, he has no idea.

00:52:36.799 --> 00:52:40.499
Okay, I get it. Then I'll see you tomorrow, darling.

00:52:40.869 --> 00:52:41.869
Bye!

00:52:49.279 --> 00:52:53.579
- You scared me! What do you want? - Is that how you greet a customer?

00:52:55.549 --> 00:52:58.249
I'm so sorry. You just really startled me.

00:52:58.819 --> 00:53:00.349
But I can't do your hair right now.

00:53:00.689 --> 00:53:03.489
It's lunchtime. The salon owner is out for a meal.

00:53:03.559 --> 00:53:05.959
Could you come back later, or would you like to wait?

00:53:18.969 --> 00:53:21.309
I'm pretty sure she's having an affair.

00:53:22.209 --> 00:53:24.279
She was all, "honey" this and "darling" that.

00:53:26.649 --> 00:53:29.119
Should I tell Gong Dae Han about this?

00:53:32.549 --> 00:53:34.349
Shoot, I don't have his number.

00:53:35.419 --> 00:53:37.559

Are we still on for the workshop tomorrow?

00:53:44.799 --> 00:53:48.369
This isn't for the whole division. Only the Design Team is going.

Oh, that's awesome.

00:53:51.669 --> 00:53:54.039
I've planned the itinerary, so just bring what you need.

Excuse me, I have to take this. It's the Vice President.

00:54:00.509 --> 00:54:01.609
Yes, Vice President.

00:54:02.379 --> 00:54:03.379
Yes.

00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:08.489
What? Why would the Vice President go to the workshop?

00:54:16.999 --> 00:54:19.769
Okay, I'll call you right back. Yes.

00:54:19.929 --> 00:54:21.999
Don't hang up. I'm going, too.

00:54:24.339 --> 00:54:26.769

Yes. Where was I?

00:54:41.119 --> 00:54:42.119
You were telling us what to bring.

00:54:42.259 --> 00:54:45.929
Right. The first piece each of you ever created.

00:54:45.989 --> 00:54:46.989
That's what you need to bring.

00:54:47.429 --> 00:54:49.099

"My First Creation."

00:54:52.899 --> 00:54:53.899
Creation?

00:54:55.739 --> 00:54:57.339

What tip?

00:55:02.879 --> 00:55:04.809
If you can't get the gold, you go for the silver.

00:55:05.879 --> 00:55:09.119
- What, are we in the Finals? - Oh, come on!

00:55:09.819 --> 00:55:14.319
If you can't be the president, let's at least secure the VP spot.

00:55:15.319 --> 00:55:16.319
Vice President?

00:55:16.389 --> 00:55:19.759
To the public, there's no difference if you're president or VP.

00:55:20.029 --> 00:55:21.559
You're still an executive of the Merchants' Association.

00:55:21.959 --> 00:55:23.829
That's the one line you need on your resume.

00:55:25.029 --> 00:55:26.029
It's not like...

00:55:26.929 --> 00:55:28.639
I can get it just by wanting it.

It's an elected position.

00:55:31.469 --> 00:55:32.539
So you'll have to go to Dr. Gong...

00:55:32.939 --> 00:55:35.639
and ask him nicely. Right, honey?

00:55:38.509 --> 00:55:41.109
No way. I'm not doing it. I have my pride.

Fine, honey. Shall I go and ask him, then?

- All right. - Cheers!

00:58:07.889 --> 00:58:08.899
This is delicious.

00:58:09.259 --> 00:58:12.099
Uncle, once you move, we won't do this often, will we?

00:58:12.229 --> 00:58:14.129
What are you talking about? My new place is around the corner.

00:58:14.499 --> 00:58:16.099
I have to come see my favourite kids all the time.

00:58:17.399 --> 00:58:20.509
Even after I move, call me whenever you want to chat.

00:58:21.469 --> 00:58:22.679
Actually, I have something to tell you guys.

00:58:24.939 --> 00:58:27.809
You know, Yang Hyun Bin from Sunny Korean Medicine Clinic.

00:58:27.809 --> 00:58:29.719
- He's back. - What?

00:58:31.119 --> 00:58:33.219
You mean that snot-nosed kid who had a crush on you?

00:58:34.489 --> 00:58:37.159
Yes. And get this, that same Yang Hyun Bin...

00:58:37.659 --> 00:58:39.089
is a director at my company now.

00:58:39.159 --> 00:58:42.999
A director? The guy who moved into Mom's studio...

00:58:43.059 --> 00:58:44.859
- is Eun Bin's brother? - Yes.

00:58:44.859 --> 00:58:48.429
Anyway, we're weirdly tied to that family.

00:58:48.429 --> 00:58:49.699
What rotten luck.

00:58:50.739 --> 00:58:54.009
Maybe that's why he acts like he doesn't know me.

00:58:54.239 --> 00:58:55.309
Really?

00:58:55.379 --> 00:58:58.479
Why? Is he embarrassed by his old crush?

00:58:59.209 --> 00:59:02.449
He's afraid his family will find out and act like you are now.

00:59:02.949 --> 00:59:06.389
I guess Mom will see him tomorrow for the final payment.

00:59:06.649 --> 00:59:09.959
Who even pays in person these days? You just wire the money.

00:59:10.019 --> 00:59:11.019
Goodness.

00:59:12.089 --> 00:59:13.929
Yes, I have the final payment ready, all in cash.

00:59:14.289 --> 00:59:16.459
Okay, I'll go to the realtor's as planned.

00:59:17.829 --> 00:59:18.929
Where are you off to?

00:59:19.729 --> 00:59:21.699
I need to make the final payment on Hyun Bin's studio apartment.

00:59:22.899 --> 00:59:25.039
But what should I do about this? The timing is a little...

00:59:25.439 --> 00:59:27.169
What's wrong? What's that?

00:59:27.769 --> 00:59:31.439
It's a rented bag and accessories. The rental shop was to pick them up,

00:59:31.509 --> 00:59:33.509
but the timing is a little tight.

00:59:35.009 --> 00:59:38.749
Leave them. I'm leaving later, so I'll make sure they get them.

00:59:39.449 --> 00:59:42.489
Really? Would you? Thank you, Yong Gil.

00:59:44.489 --> 00:59:46.359
This is quite a surprise.

00:59:47.559 --> 00:59:50.199
I know, right? I wondered who demands the final amount...

00:59:50.259 --> 00:59:51.929
in cash these days,

00:59:53.869 --> 00:59:55.129
and it turned out to be you, Doctor.

00:59:55.569 --> 00:59:56.939
I have my reasons.

00:59:58.069 --> 01:00:02.109
It's a small world, isn't it? I used to live there.

01:00:02.179 --> 01:00:03.979
I never thought your son would be the one to move in.

01:00:05.139 --> 01:00:07.309
My son's company is nearby.

01:00:08.249 --> 01:00:10.049
You've heard of Taehan Group, haven't you?

01:00:10.649 --> 01:00:11.819
He's a director there.

01:00:12.519 --> 01:00:13.549
Taehan?

01:00:14.519 --> 01:00:17.089
My daughter works at Taehan, too. She's a designer.

01:00:23.029 --> 01:00:26.769
You see, a rank-and-file employee...

01:00:27.229 --> 01:00:30.999
and a corporate executive are on completely different levels.

01:00:32.669 --> 01:00:35.269
You seem to feel better when you put everyone into hierarchies.

01:00:35.409 --> 01:00:38.109
That must be an occupational hazard for you, Doctor.

01:00:38.379 --> 01:00:40.949
Carelessly analysing everyone you meet.

01:00:41.009 --> 01:00:45.619
If you're offended by my analysis, it just means I've hit a nerve.

01:01:04.899 --> 01:01:05.939
Why are you...

01:01:12.779 --> 01:01:13.909
I'm sorry, Director.

01:01:14.249 --> 01:01:17.549
For some reason, I get carsick if I sit in the front seat.

01:01:17.819 --> 01:01:18.989
Don't worry.

01:01:19.489 --> 01:01:21.819
I was planning on driving anyway.

01:01:22.189 --> 01:01:25.629
I have no intention of telling you the destination beforehand.

01:01:26.629 --> 01:01:27.759
But, Director...

01:01:28.189 --> 01:01:30.999
Where could we possibly be going that requires this much secrecy?

01:01:33.129 --> 01:01:35.769
You'll just have to wonder.

01:01:36.669 --> 01:01:39.209
I heard the HR Team's workshop was at a five-star hotel.

01:01:39.639 --> 01:01:40.969
So we're going there too, right?

01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:45.609
Whatever you're imagining, it'll be better than that.

01:01:48.919 --> 01:01:52.849
- Five-star. - Five-star.

01:01:52.989 --> 01:01:54.219
- Five-star. - Five-star.

01:01:54.789 --> 01:01:56.819
- Here you go. - Thanks.

01:01:57.689 --> 01:02:00.859
I would've brought it after work. Why did you come all this way?

01:02:01.129 --> 01:02:03.099
I couldn't wait another second.

01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:07.099
This is amazing.

01:02:08.099 --> 01:02:11.739
- You're that happy? - Yes. When I think of the future,

01:02:11.799 --> 01:02:13.169
I'm just so happy.

01:02:14.909 --> 01:02:16.279
I'm sorry for everything.

01:02:16.779 --> 01:02:19.049
It must have been hard on you, living together because of me.

01:02:19.979 --> 01:02:23.779
That's all in the past now. I'm truly grateful to you.

01:02:24.819 --> 01:02:26.149
How about we grab lunch together before you go?

01:02:26.419 --> 01:02:29.859
No, I should go. Someone's waiting for me. Bye.

01:02:30.559 --> 01:02:32.359
- Okay, see you later. - Okay.

01:02:33.789 --> 01:02:37.159
What do you mean our house deposit hasn't come through?

01:02:38.099 --> 01:02:42.129
My daughter-in-law was supposed to drop it off last night.

01:02:42.799 --> 01:02:46.369
Hey, beautiful. Did she give you the last payment?

01:02:47.739 --> 01:02:50.439
Why did you ask for it in cash? It's so bulky and risky.

01:02:51.079 --> 01:02:52.179
Hurry home, and be careful.

01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:55.649
Honey. I'm not coming back.

01:02:56.279 --> 01:02:58.149
I called to tell you that I'm leaving you.

01:03:00.189 --> 01:03:02.219
What? What are you talking about?

01:03:02.689 --> 01:03:04.019
What do you mean you're not coming back?

01:03:05.019 --> 01:03:06.089
Look, honey.

01:03:07.059 --> 01:03:08.189
Leaving? Where are you going?

01:03:14.899 --> 01:03:18.099
Please try to understand, honey.

01:03:19.039 --> 01:03:21.069
Of course, I understand, honey. I always do.

01:03:22.439 --> 01:03:23.939
Thank you for understanding.

01:03:24.439 --> 01:03:27.109
In that case, I guess this is goodbye.

01:03:27.709 --> 01:03:28.849
Bye.

01:03:29.479 --> 01:03:30.479
Hello?

01:03:31.719 --> 01:03:32.749
Hello? Honey?

01:03:34.189 --> 01:03:35.219
Was that Hui Gyeong?

01:03:38.489 --> 01:03:39.489
Mom.

01:03:40.129 --> 01:03:41.229
What did she say?

01:03:42.299 --> 01:03:45.159
- What? - What did she say?

01:04:15.129 --> 01:04:17.929
(Recipe for Love)

01:04:17.999 --> 01:04:20.399
I'll have to get on my knees and beg to be Vice President.

01:04:20.469 --> 01:04:21.799
There's a way to get the same result...

01:04:21.799 --> 01:04:25.099
without actually having to do it. I'll show you how.

01:04:25.539 --> 01:04:29.139
This has Bucket's wife's fingerprints all over it.

01:04:29.379 --> 01:04:31.879
I've made thorough preparations, so there's no need to worry.

01:04:31.879 --> 01:04:35.279
How dare you call his father a thief when you don't even know the facts?

01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:38.049
If he's caused trouble again, I'm kicking you all out this time.

01:04:39.919 --> 01:04:42.359
- It's romantic. - I knew it.

01:04:42.419 --> 01:04:46.329
You're talking to me like you knew me in the past.

01:04:47.089 --> 01:04:50.359
I need you to run a location trace. Please, you have to help me.

01:04:52.669 --> 01:04:53.669
Ganghwa?
