WEBVTT

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.407
Cher.

00:00:11.407 --> 00:00:14.123
Did you know P’Preem just asked me to audition for a series?

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.003
I’d be paired with P’Charm.

00:00:16.503 --> 00:00:17.381
You've passed the first round.

00:00:18.253 --> 00:00:20.686
This round, we will have someone acting opposite you.

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:22.785
I really wanna know…

00:00:22.785 --> 00:00:25.616
If you and P’Charm ever met again,

00:00:25.616 --> 00:00:27.488
would she even recognize you?

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.561
I kinda wanna know too—if she saw me now,

00:00:32.561 --> 00:00:36.450
would she still look at me the same way she did back then?

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.430
Mom… are you leaving me like Dad did?

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.287
It’s not like that, Charm.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.292
I’m not abandoning you, sweetheart.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.954
America isn’t that far.

00:00:53.238 --> 00:00:57.154
Whenever we miss each other, you can fly over and see me anytime, okay?

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.296
Charm…

00:01:06.857 --> 00:01:09.266
I really have to move to America with Steve.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.090
Ever since your dad walked away and started a new family,

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.580
it’s only been you and me.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.040
You’re all I’ve had.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.300
And now you’re leaving me too?

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.886
I know.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.424
I know this

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.680
is really hard for you, Charm.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.388
But I also know

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:37.941
my Charm is stronger than this.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.800
And I believe

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.096
you can stay here and

00:01:42.758 --> 00:01:44.314
take care of yourself.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.640
Yes, Mom.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:56.840
I’m strong.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.100
You should go.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.630
I’ll manage.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.800
Go pack.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.570
Dad loves someone else now.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.903
He doesn’t love you anymore.

00:02:58.471 --> 00:03:00.600
I’ll stay with you.

00:03:01.215 --> 00:03:02.649
Don’t cry.

00:03:03.452 --> 00:03:06.633
From now on, I’ll protect you.

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:10.695
Thank you for staying with me, Charm.

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.403
Mom met someone.

00:03:17.403 --> 00:03:20.000
His name’s Steve. He’s American.

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.195
Are you sure

00:03:22.715 --> 00:03:24.566
he’s not just fooling you?

00:03:25.228 --> 00:03:27.860
I don’t want to see you cry like that again.

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:30.691
No, sweetheart.

00:03:30.691 --> 00:03:32.531
Steve isn’t that kind of man.

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:38.548
Yes, Mom.

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:11.799
Mint.

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:16.189
Can I stay over tonight?

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:23.629
What’s wrong, Charm?

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:31.539
Mom’s moving to America.

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:38.869
I don’t have anyone left now, Mint.

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:44.809
You still have me.

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:02.329
Don’t leave me.

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:08.029
I never will.

00:06:04.119 --> 00:06:05.349
Let me go check first.

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:10.099
Oh—do we have a guest?

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:17.339
P’Mac.

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:19.885
This is Charm.

00:06:20.358 --> 00:06:22.032
She’s my friend.

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:24.369
Oh.

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:25.949
Nice to meet you.

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:27.529
P’Mac is my fiancé.

00:06:55.619 --> 00:06:57.129
I love you, Mint.

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:03.079
If I didn’t have you,

00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:05.199
I don’t think I could even smile.

00:07:23.679 --> 00:07:25.050
Charm…

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:26.959
It’s not what you think.

00:07:27.369 --> 00:07:28.519
Please, just hear me out first.

00:07:37.509 --> 00:07:38.369
Charm.

00:07:38.653 --> 00:07:39.611
Charm.

00:10:17.228 --> 00:10:17.891
Charm.

00:10:18.317 --> 00:10:20.000
I’m sorry.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.197
Ever since that day, I’ve tried calling you every day.

00:10:22.906 --> 00:10:24.704
But you never picked up.

00:10:24.704 --> 00:10:26.218
I wanted to explain.

00:10:27.278 --> 00:10:28.958
I don’t think there’s anything left to explain, Mint.

00:10:29.788 --> 00:10:31.432
P’Mac—

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:37.470
our parents arranged it. I really couldn’t say no.

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:40.958
And you knew, didn’t you—

00:10:41.337 --> 00:10:43.706
this was never going to have a future.

00:10:47.538 --> 00:10:48.478
Then why did we sleep together?

00:10:49.768 --> 00:10:51.408
Why did we end up in bed almost every time we met?

00:10:52.988 --> 00:10:53.849
Why, Mint—why would you do that?

00:10:55.173 --> 00:10:57.362
If you never saw a future with me.

00:11:00.228 --> 00:11:03.174
I’m not your emotional safety net, Mint.

00:11:04.628 --> 00:11:05.838
But if you’ve made your choice,

00:11:07.418 --> 00:11:08.168
then go.

00:11:09.738 --> 00:11:10.838
Go have your perfect future.

00:11:12.708 --> 00:11:13.998
Don’t pretend you care about me.

00:11:58.178 --> 00:11:59.179
Charm.

00:12:10.968 --> 00:12:12.278
Charm.

00:12:14.618 --> 00:12:15.498
Charm.

00:12:31.058 --> 00:12:33.238
Seeing you like this makes me scared of love, for real.

00:12:35.838 --> 00:12:37.628
Oh—you’re awake?

00:12:38.628 --> 00:12:39.918
Thought you’d drink yourself to death.

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:44.200
Wan.

00:12:45.003 --> 00:12:46.308
When did you get here?

00:12:47.528 --> 00:12:50.272
Just in time before you passed out drunk in this house.

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:52.638
So… you okay?

00:12:55.048 --> 00:12:58.258
Hey, come here.

00:12:58.258 --> 00:13:01.468
Forget the hug—screw that, Charm.

00:13:02.928 --> 00:13:03.870
Go find someone new.

00:13:04.201 --> 00:13:07.838
Find someone a hundred times better than Mint.

00:13:09.908 --> 00:13:11.038
I was almost touched.

00:13:13.218 --> 00:13:14.531
My head’s spinning.

00:13:16.968 --> 00:13:17.545
Come on.

00:13:17.545 --> 00:13:19.494
Let’s focus on work instead.

00:13:19.764 --> 00:13:21.820
So what are you gonna do

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.438
about the GL series audition?

00:13:30.468 --> 00:13:31.353
I’m not sure.

00:13:32.109 --> 00:13:34.344
I know it’s a good opportunity.

00:13:35.198 --> 00:13:37.078
I just don’t know if I’m actually ready.

00:13:37.362 --> 00:13:39.242
What are you unsure about?

00:13:39.898 --> 00:13:41.638
You know how important this is.

00:13:42.498 --> 00:13:45.708
Breakthrough chances in this industry don’t come easy.

00:13:46.318 --> 00:13:47.308
I just—

00:13:51.078 --> 00:13:52.878
don’t know if I can really act.

00:13:56.068 --> 00:13:57.750
You’ve studied acting for years.

00:13:58.175 --> 00:13:59.565
Why wouldn’t you be able to?

00:14:03.258 --> 00:14:04.973
Fine, whatever.

00:14:05.257 --> 00:14:07.161
But don’t keep getting wasted over Mint

00:14:07.161 --> 00:14:08.438
and throw your future away.

00:14:09.301 --> 00:14:10.000
I’m asking you.

00:14:11.448 --> 00:14:13.334
And no more drinking like that.

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:15.079
We’ve got something important this week.

00:14:15.599 --> 00:14:17.201
The makeup artist’s gonna yell

00:14:17.201 --> 00:14:18.988
about those dark circles under your eyes.

00:14:23.858 --> 00:14:24.558
Okay.

00:14:25.988 --> 00:14:27.348
I’ll try.

00:14:49.308 --> 00:14:49.808
Charm.

00:14:57.521 --> 00:14:58.298
Hey.

00:14:59.101 --> 00:15:01.044
You look insanely good, by the way.

00:15:04.527 --> 00:15:05.340
So, Charm—

00:15:06.617 --> 00:15:07.117
about

00:15:07.353 --> 00:15:08.258
what I asked earlier.

00:15:08.684 --> 00:15:09.596
The series audition.

00:15:15.537 --> 00:15:16.319
I—

00:15:16.792 --> 00:15:19.353
I talked to P’Chee about the details.

00:15:20.777 --> 00:15:21.521
He really

00:15:21.994 --> 00:15:23.582
wants you as the lead.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.150
Just go, okay?

00:15:26.107 --> 00:15:26.827
Please?

00:15:28.831 --> 00:15:29.659
If you do it,

00:15:29.895 --> 00:15:32.957
they’ll cast someone who matches your vibe afterward.

00:15:33.657 --> 00:15:35.307
Just try.

00:15:41.607 --> 00:15:42.527
Hey, Charm, at least audition.

00:15:43.637 --> 00:15:46.947
I think this role needs someone who’s honest with the character’s feelings.

00:15:47.927 --> 00:15:48.695
A GL series—

00:15:49.121 --> 00:15:49.805
for me—

00:15:50.278 --> 00:15:51.277
isn’t just about trends.

00:15:51.941 --> 00:15:53.406
It’s about telling a love story

00:15:53.642 --> 00:15:55.087
that deserves to be seen

00:15:56.227 --> 00:15:57.777
and respected.

00:16:00.307 --> 00:16:01.494
You have eyes that tell stories.

00:16:01.967 --> 00:16:03.370
Even when you’re still,

00:16:04.247 --> 00:16:05.435
you communicate.

00:16:05.435 --> 00:16:06.668
If you’re ready

00:16:07.094 --> 00:16:08.326
to really listen to the character’s heart

00:16:09.827 --> 00:16:12.077
and stand by their truth,

00:16:12.077 --> 00:16:14.327
I think this project will mean a lot—

00:16:30.467 --> 00:16:32.297
Number 009, please step forward.

00:16:33.787 --> 00:16:35.527
You passed the first round.

00:17:16.755 --> 00:17:19.535
That was excellent.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:47.700
Okay, Aom.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.935
I think we’ve found our actress.

00:17:49.935 --> 00:17:51.979
Schedule the workshop.

00:17:51.979 --> 00:17:53.080
Yes, P’Chee.

00:17:53.948 --> 00:17:55.358
Amazing.

00:18:11.671 --> 00:18:13.501
Mom.

00:18:13.501 --> 00:18:15.141
Please.

00:18:15.943 --> 00:18:17.512
Just this one project.

00:18:17.843 --> 00:18:18.343
After this—

00:18:18.343 --> 00:18:20.585
I promise

00:18:20.585 --> 00:18:22.881
I’ll do everything you and Dad ask.

00:18:23.212 --> 00:18:25.798
Please.

00:18:26.407 --> 00:18:29.287
You didn’t even consult me first.

00:18:30.517 --> 00:18:32.830
It’s a girl-love series, right?

00:18:33.397 --> 00:18:35.189
I’m not against it.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.353
I just want to look at the details carefully.

00:18:39.062 --> 00:18:41.942
I’m worried people might think

00:18:41.942 --> 00:18:43.301
you actually like girls.

00:18:43.727 --> 00:18:44.463
Mom—

00:18:45.078 --> 00:18:46.378
It’s just acting.

00:18:47.011 --> 00:18:47.511
And

00:18:48.078 --> 00:18:49.105
besides—

00:18:49.105 --> 00:18:51.268
if I get famous,

00:18:51.747 --> 00:18:54.107
it’ll be good for our mall, won’t it?

00:18:54.827 --> 00:18:57.477
I mean it.

00:18:59.047 --> 00:18:59.767
Honey—

00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:02.317
what do you think?

00:19:03.917 --> 00:19:05.987
Let her do what she wants.

00:19:06.649 --> 00:19:07.664
But you have to promise—

00:19:08.232 --> 00:19:08.992
that after this,

00:19:09.181 --> 00:19:11.457
you’ll do what we ask.

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:12.903
I promise.

00:19:13.565 --> 00:19:15.860
Love you, Dad.

00:19:16.333 --> 00:19:18.229
You really know how to sweet-talk.

00:19:19.222 --> 00:19:22.631
Don’t try that on me.

00:19:22.631 --> 00:19:23.916
Please, Mom.

00:19:24.416 --> 00:19:26.539
Just let me do this.

00:19:26.822 --> 00:19:27.922
Dad already said yes.

00:19:31.387 --> 00:19:33.942
Seeing P’Charm again

00:19:33.942 --> 00:19:36.404
makes my heart race.

00:19:37.255 --> 00:19:38.341
That feeling—

00:19:38.767 --> 00:19:40.120
from when I was younger,

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:41.952
wanting to wake up early

00:19:41.952 --> 00:19:45.379
just to go to school

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:48.157
to see someone—

00:20:05.167 --> 00:20:06.197
it’s back.

00:20:07.037 --> 00:20:08.427
When I’m working,

00:20:09.487 --> 00:20:13.627
I can distract myself.

00:20:15.027 --> 00:20:17.600
But when I’m alone,

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.397
my thoughts go right back to her.

00:20:20.217 --> 00:20:22.587
I know

00:20:24.077 --> 00:20:26.297
I’m someone with strong desires.

00:20:27.067 --> 00:20:28.317
And Mint

00:20:29.137 --> 00:20:31.589
handled that well.

00:21:11.299 --> 00:21:11.988
Do I know that person?

00:21:24.277 --> 00:21:25.557
Is that a cat?

00:21:27.496 --> 00:21:30.266
Why does it feel like I’ve seen that cat somewhere before?

00:21:32.437 --> 00:21:33.333
But where?

00:21:42.829 --> 00:21:46.791
Hi, we’re the cast of Frozen Valentine.

00:21:47.027 --> 00:21:47.764
Let’s take a look

00:21:47.764 --> 00:21:49.598
at who’s playing who.

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:51.327
Hi, I’m Preem.

00:21:51.658 --> 00:21:52.925
I play Fai.

00:21:55.886 --> 00:21:58.238
Hi, I’m Pingrak. I play May.

00:22:01.096 --> 00:22:02.826
Hi, I’m Milk.

00:22:02.826 --> 00:22:04.556
I play Eva.

00:22:07.796 --> 00:22:10.576
Hi, I’m Charm. I play Pam.

00:22:36.976 --> 00:22:37.496
Cut.

00:22:38.426 --> 00:22:39.380
Aom.

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:40.096
Jane.

00:22:43.736 --> 00:22:46.536
Are you two not comfortable with each other yet?

00:22:48.686 --> 00:22:52.416
I think we’ll need a few more workshop sessions.

00:22:53.086 --> 00:22:54.573
Okay, Wan.

00:22:54.809 --> 00:22:55.475
Take

00:22:55.759 --> 00:22:56.759
Charm

00:22:56.995 --> 00:22:58.887
to rest for a bit.

00:23:00.706 --> 00:23:02.627
Pingrak, and everyone else, take five.

00:23:02.627 --> 00:23:05.635
Let’s pause the shoot for a moment.

00:23:06.581 --> 00:23:07.446
Let’s go.

00:23:11.596 --> 00:23:14.876
Wow, she’s kind of aloof.

00:23:16.756 --> 00:23:18.576
But she’s cool though.

00:23:24.296 --> 00:23:26.076
Okay, girls.

00:23:26.236 --> 00:23:28.708
Today we’re going to do

00:23:28.708 --> 00:23:30.187
some ice-breaking exercises

00:23:30.187 --> 00:23:33.449
and syncing activities.

00:23:33.449 --> 00:23:35.722
First activity—

00:23:35.911 --> 00:23:37.483
eye contact.

00:23:37.894 --> 00:23:41.047
Just look into each other’s eyes.

00:23:41.252 --> 00:23:45.140
Let it say everything without words.

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:46.753
Then I’ll ask you how you feel.

00:23:47.086 --> 00:23:48.870
I’ll count to three.

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:50.826
Open your eyes when I do.

00:23:52.106 --> 00:23:53.011
One.

00:23:54.381 --> 00:23:55.230
Two.

00:23:56.412 --> 00:23:57.196
Three.

00:24:25.576 --> 00:24:27.216
In P’Charm’s eyes,

00:24:30.256 --> 00:24:31.376
I see strength.

00:24:35.126 --> 00:24:35.925
But also…

00:24:42.116 --> 00:24:45.466
something that feels sad underneath.

00:24:58.906 --> 00:25:00.256
In Ping’s eyes,

00:25:07.766 --> 00:25:09.586
I see sincerity

00:25:13.516 --> 00:25:14.866
and determination

00:25:16.376 --> 00:25:17.716
like she’s trying to say something.

00:25:31.786 --> 00:25:33.312
Second activity.

00:25:33.312 --> 00:25:35.796
It’s called the mirror exercise.

00:25:35.796 --> 00:25:38.327
Face each other.

00:25:38.327 --> 00:25:40.520
No one leads.

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:43.594
No one follows.

00:25:43.783 --> 00:25:46.735
Focus on each other’s breathing.

00:26:27.406 --> 00:26:28.843
Okay.

00:26:29.221 --> 00:26:30.000
Next—

00:26:30.378 --> 00:26:32.959
the love story activity.

00:26:32.959 --> 00:26:38.359
I want Charm and Ping to take turns

00:26:38.682 --> 00:26:41.324
sharing a love experience you’ll never forget.

00:26:41.607 --> 00:26:43.608
Speak only about your own feelings.

00:26:43.844 --> 00:26:45.319
If you’re ready,

00:26:45.697 --> 00:26:46.917
you can begin.

00:26:57.715 --> 00:26:59.475
My last relationship

00:27:02.015 --> 00:27:03.095
was when I was seventeen.

00:27:05.695 --> 00:27:08.061
She was sweet.

00:27:09.735 --> 00:27:10.805
She took good care of me.

00:27:12.595 --> 00:27:13.515
She knew how to spoil me.

00:27:16.575 --> 00:27:17.505
I truly believed

00:27:18.885 --> 00:27:19.945
she was the one.

00:27:21.585 --> 00:27:22.775
The last one.

00:27:35.185 --> 00:27:36.745
But she chose to walk away with someone else.

00:27:40.415 --> 00:27:41.515
Back then, I was in so much pain.

00:27:44.575 --> 00:27:45.915
So much that I wanted to believe

00:27:47.555 --> 00:27:49.425
the person who once promised forever

00:27:56.585 --> 00:27:57.645
would eventually

00:27:59.475 --> 00:28:01.035
become nothing but a memory.

00:28:02.705 --> 00:28:03.451
Huh?

00:28:04.375 --> 00:28:07.345
Is P’Charm talking about P’Mint?

00:28:08.225 --> 00:28:10.745
Does that mean they broke up?

00:28:24.126 --> 00:28:25.375
I’ve never had a boyfriend.

00:28:28.075 --> 00:28:29.035
But…

00:28:30.995 --> 00:28:33.125
I once had a crush on a senior in school.

00:28:54.915 --> 00:28:57.585
She never looked at me.

00:28:59.685 --> 00:29:00.725
Not even once.

00:29:07.435 --> 00:29:09.495
No matter what I tried to do for her,

00:29:12.925 --> 00:29:14.205
she just—

00:29:16.495 --> 00:29:18.478
always seemed annoyed with me.

00:29:18.478 --> 00:29:20.083
“You’re annoying.”

00:29:20.335 --> 00:29:22.575
“I don’t like people chasing me.”

00:29:32.445 --> 00:29:34.511
Last activity for today—

00:29:34.511 --> 00:29:38.176
the love line mini-game.

00:29:38.724 --> 00:29:41.258
I want you two to move closer.

00:29:41.258 --> 00:29:43.462
As close as you can,

00:29:43.462 --> 00:29:46.044
while still feeling safe.

00:30:03.605 --> 00:30:04.555
Hold hands.

00:30:13.115 --> 00:30:14.025
Wrap an arm around the waist.

00:30:22.805 --> 00:30:25.135
Then press your foreheads together.

00:30:31.829 --> 00:30:32.467
Who

00:30:33.082 --> 00:30:35.140
would ever reject someone this beautiful?

00:30:36.181 --> 00:30:37.181
So stupid.

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:53.232
No wonder my heart’s beating this fast.

00:30:54.462 --> 00:30:56.070
It’s because I’ve been

00:30:57.772 --> 00:31:00.589
secretly crushing on P’Charm for years.

00:31:21.385 --> 00:31:21.975
Cut.

00:31:26.715 --> 00:31:27.515
Okay.

00:31:28.455 --> 00:31:30.095
How does everyone feel today?

00:31:33.425 --> 00:31:34.645
I feel like…

00:31:35.915 --> 00:31:37.825
P’Charm is an amazing actress.

00:31:39.252 --> 00:31:42.307
And P’Charm, how do you feel?

00:31:45.807 --> 00:31:46.532
Ping.

00:31:54.955 --> 00:31:55.775
Very sincere.

00:31:59.165 --> 00:32:01.291
Thank you so much for today.

00:32:01.527 --> 00:32:04.031
I hope we keep improving little by little.

00:32:04.551 --> 00:32:06.867
That’s it for today. Class dismissed.

00:32:08.725 --> 00:32:09.465
Great job.

00:32:25.635 --> 00:32:26.425
How are you getting home, Ping?

00:32:28.765 --> 00:32:29.945
Oh—

00:32:30.955 --> 00:32:32.645
I drove.

00:32:35.055 --> 00:32:35.895
Okay.

00:32:37.437 --> 00:32:39.235
I’ll head out first then.

00:32:48.334 --> 00:32:49.638
That’s ridiculous.

00:32:49.638 --> 00:32:52.550
I can’t believe P’Charm asked like she actually cared.

00:32:53.462 --> 00:32:54.138
Or…

00:32:55.674 --> 00:32:56.845
maybe it was

00:32:57.176 --> 00:32:59.934
just basic politeness.

00:33:08.474 --> 00:33:11.074
So? Did she remember you?

00:33:11.954 --> 00:33:14.935
She didn’t remember me at all, Cher.

00:33:16.114 --> 00:33:16.904
Ugh.

00:33:17.934 --> 00:33:20.024
So are you going to tell her?

00:33:25.204 --> 00:33:28.932
You’re acting opposite her

00:33:29.263 --> 00:33:30.916
and you’re not saying anything?

00:33:31.152 --> 00:33:32.700
Why, Ping?

00:33:33.264 --> 00:33:34.594
I just—

00:33:35.314 --> 00:33:38.364
want to really know her once in my life.

00:33:40.464 --> 00:33:42.090
Why though?

00:33:42.959 --> 00:33:44.301
I see. I see.

00:33:44.584 --> 00:33:46.919
Main character energy.

00:33:47.297 --> 00:33:48.832
“Really know her once in my life.”

00:33:50.044 --> 00:33:52.011
Wow.

00:33:52.323 --> 00:33:53.674
I’m serious.

00:33:54.052 --> 00:33:55.295
I really mean it.

00:33:56.808 --> 00:33:57.968
Go away, Cher.

00:33:58.258 --> 00:34:01.182
I want dessert. I’m done talking about this.

00:34:25.774 --> 00:34:26.643
P’Charm…

00:34:26.832 --> 00:34:28.460
followed Charmie’s IG?

00:34:35.824 --> 00:34:37.029
Charmie.

00:34:37.029 --> 00:34:39.334
Come here.

00:34:40.695 --> 00:34:44.539
Did you know your twin just followed you?

00:34:47.104 --> 00:34:49.486
Why am I this happy?

00:35:01.834 --> 00:35:02.969
Hi.

00:35:02.969 --> 00:35:05.144
I’m Pingrak. I play May.

00:35:05.379 --> 00:35:06.845
Hi.

00:35:06.845 --> 00:35:08.831
I’m Preem. I play Fai.

00:35:09.399 --> 00:35:11.288
Milk here. I play Eva.

00:35:11.802 --> 00:35:15.592
Trust me, this series is spicy.

00:35:24.194 --> 00:35:26.297
Please follow us.

00:35:26.297 --> 00:35:28.401
Yes.

00:35:28.401 --> 00:35:30.504
Oh—one more.

00:35:33.424 --> 00:35:35.614
Hi, I’m Charm.

00:35:35.614 --> 00:35:36.650
I play Pam.

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:38.435
Don’t forget to follow us.

00:35:38.625 --> 00:35:39.656
Okay?

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:40.950
Bye-bye.

00:35:46.294 --> 00:35:47.655
Cut.

00:35:52.124 --> 00:35:52.766
Ping.

00:35:53.901 --> 00:35:57.474
The director asked me to tell you—

00:35:58.144 --> 00:35:59.314
you need to relax more.

00:36:01.234 --> 00:36:01.944
Be more natural.

00:36:10.368 --> 00:36:11.208
Take it easy, Ping.

00:36:12.404 --> 00:36:14.374
You’ve done harder stage plays than this.

00:36:17.208 --> 00:36:17.708
How about this—

00:36:18.817 --> 00:36:21.557
just imagine P’Charm isn’t P’Charm.

00:36:23.044 --> 00:36:23.544
Like…

00:36:24.874 --> 00:36:27.121
think of her as a body pillow.

00:36:27.121 --> 00:36:28.086
Or a doll.

00:36:28.086 --> 00:36:29.164
Or—

00:36:30.074 --> 00:36:31.394
your cat.

00:36:33.704 --> 00:36:35.534
Better?

00:36:37.694 --> 00:36:38.264
Good job.

00:37:02.854 --> 00:37:04.184
That’s a wrap.

00:37:29.214 --> 00:37:30.314
See? You can do it.

00:37:35.794 --> 00:37:37.461
Thank you, P’Charm.

00:37:37.461 --> 00:37:40.000
But next time, don’t waste everyone’s time.

00:37:50.424 --> 00:37:54.434
P’Charm’s gotten way more aloof.

00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:57.090
Still cool though.

00:38:09.554 --> 00:38:11.234
Did you ever really love me?

00:38:17.084 --> 00:38:18.934
Or was I just something temporary?

00:39:06.413 --> 00:39:07.283
Cut.

00:39:08.143 --> 00:39:09.563
That was incredible.

00:39:14.993 --> 00:39:15.793
Seriously amazing.

00:39:17.083 --> 00:39:18.752
P’Charm—

00:39:19.225 --> 00:39:21.367
you were so good.

00:39:21.367 --> 00:39:22.371
It felt real.

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:25.164
If I didn’t know you were acting,

00:39:25.651 --> 00:39:27.793
I’d think you just got your heart broken.

00:39:36.014 --> 00:39:37.806
What did you just say?

00:39:39.091 --> 00:39:40.990
I was just complimenting you.

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:42.387
If you don’t know the truth,

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:45.226
don’t joke about it.

00:39:52.113 --> 00:39:53.243
What’s her problem?

00:39:53.858 --> 00:39:55.885
I was praising her.

00:40:02.703 --> 00:40:05.083
Excuse me—have you seen Charm?

00:40:09.113 --> 00:40:11.753
She’s probably at her usual corner.

00:40:12.933 --> 00:40:15.233
P’Wan,

00:40:16.193 --> 00:40:18.097
you really take good care of P’Charm.

00:40:18.097 --> 00:40:19.336
Always driving her around.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.745
Just doing my job.

00:40:21.745 --> 00:40:23.115
Oh.

00:40:24.853 --> 00:40:26.573
Your job?

00:40:28.013 --> 00:40:30.183
Why drag that out like that?

00:40:31.553 --> 00:40:32.613
It’s nothing.

00:40:32.613 --> 00:40:35.236
Just teasing.

00:40:35.236 --> 00:40:39.267
You just seem really dedicated to her.

00:40:39.267 --> 00:40:43.515
Makes me wish I had a manager like you.

00:40:43.515 --> 00:40:45.601
I’ll head out first.

00:40:45.601 --> 00:40:46.621
Okay.

00:40:46.621 --> 00:40:48.353
See you later.

00:40:49.043 --> 00:40:51.843
Maybe I’ll hitch a ride next time.

00:41:09.713 --> 00:41:10.213
Cheers.

00:41:18.383 --> 00:41:19.593
Why are you so tense?

00:41:20.673 --> 00:41:21.663
Forget it.

00:41:29.393 --> 00:41:30.726
Easy for you to say.

00:41:30.962 --> 00:41:31.496
Fine.

00:41:32.733 --> 00:41:34.773
I’m going to the restroom.

00:41:50.143 --> 00:41:51.213
Hey there, beautiful.

00:41:52.483 --> 00:41:53.193
Alone tonight?

00:41:54.733 --> 00:41:57.133
Did I walk in with an invisible friend?

00:41:58.593 --> 00:42:00.083
Oh—

00:42:01.023 --> 00:42:06.291
Want some company?

00:42:07.383 --> 00:42:08.203
No.

00:42:09.291 --> 00:42:10.803
Please step back.

00:42:16.043 --> 00:42:18.364
Don’t act so stuck-up.

00:42:18.364 --> 00:42:19.002
Relax.

00:42:19.853 --> 00:42:20.893
I said no.

00:42:21.793 --> 00:42:23.485
Step back right now.

00:42:23.674 --> 00:42:24.600
I just—

00:42:25.074 --> 00:42:26.555
wanted to buy you another drink.

00:42:26.791 --> 00:42:28.239
Don’t make it a big deal.

00:42:32.843 --> 00:42:34.838
You’re harassing me.

00:42:35.196 --> 00:42:37.806
Step back right now, or I’m calling security.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.784
Come on—

00:42:42.162 --> 00:42:42.987
Let go.

00:42:45.199 --> 00:42:46.824
What’s your problem?

00:42:47.013 --> 00:42:48.360
I just asked you for a drink.

00:42:49.117 --> 00:42:50.530
PMS or something?

00:42:50.767 --> 00:42:53.527
Or your husband not satisfying you?

00:42:56.453 --> 00:42:57.753
I don’t want a husband.

00:42:58.403 --> 00:42:59.673
I want a wife.

00:43:13.303 --> 00:43:16.255
Hey—what are you doing?

00:43:20.343 --> 00:43:23.213
I don’t want a husband. I want a wife.

00:43:43.303 --> 00:43:44.653
I saw the clip.

00:43:46.403 --> 00:43:49.373
Tell me what happened last night.

00:43:52.463 --> 00:43:53.253
Last night…

00:43:55.003 --> 00:43:57.323
I punched a pervert who tried to grope me.

00:43:58.603 --> 00:43:59.103
Okay.

00:43:59.973 --> 00:44:02.143
I understand self-defense.

00:44:03.123 --> 00:44:07.198
But we’re public figures.

00:44:07.198 --> 00:44:09.695
This will get amplified.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:10.821
Listen, Charm.

00:44:11.883 --> 00:44:13.093
Your identity—

00:44:13.737 --> 00:44:16.537
That’s personal. I respect that.

00:44:17.409 --> 00:44:19.279
But as a model and actress,

00:44:20.405 --> 00:44:22.825
you need to handle this better.

00:44:23.345 --> 00:44:26.569
You have to think about the consequences.

00:44:26.569 --> 00:44:29.463
If we lose control of this,

00:44:30.093 --> 00:44:32.123
it won’t just affect you.

00:44:33.142 --> 00:44:35.462
It’ll affect the team

00:44:36.302 --> 00:44:37.592
and the series too.

00:44:38.582 --> 00:44:40.182
I hope you understand that.

00:44:43.012 --> 00:44:43.902
Yes.

00:44:46.122 --> 00:44:47.142
I’m on your side.

00:44:48.602 --> 00:44:50.383
I’m not saying what you did was wrong.

00:44:50.903 --> 00:44:54.045
But you have to manage what comes after.

00:44:54.612 --> 00:44:56.359
I’ve asked PR to handle it.

00:44:56.759 --> 00:44:58.641
Legal will step in as well.

00:44:59.156 --> 00:45:00.049
In the meantime,

00:45:00.811 --> 00:45:03.739
no posting. Stay off social media for now.

00:45:04.733 --> 00:45:05.415
Okay.

00:45:06.596 --> 00:45:07.332
Good.

00:45:08.132 --> 00:45:10.042
This is your chance to fix it.

00:45:10.956 --> 00:45:13.830
I hope something like this doesn’t happen again.

00:45:14.992 --> 00:45:16.982
I believe you’ll learn from this.

00:45:17.621 --> 00:45:18.558
And grow.

00:45:19.078 --> 00:45:20.712
I hope so.

00:45:21.674 --> 00:45:22.174
Yes.

00:45:23.830 --> 00:45:24.575
Thank you.

00:45:27.552 --> 00:45:29.614
Do you think Charm actually likes girls?

00:45:29.614 --> 00:45:31.475
Or is it just hype for the series?

00:45:31.711 --> 00:45:32.351
No idea.

00:45:32.351 --> 00:45:34.748
I’ve never seen her publicly date a woman.

00:45:34.984 --> 00:45:35.610
Right?

00:45:36.110 --> 00:45:38.554
If she really did, there’d be news already.

00:45:41.627 --> 00:45:45.179
If you don’t know the truth, don’t judge P’Charm.

00:45:45.956 --> 00:45:47.096
Oh? And you do?

00:45:48.281 --> 00:45:49.564
No, I don’t.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.850
But I know it’s her private life.

00:45:52.771 --> 00:45:54.651
Not something people get to joke about

00:45:54.651 --> 00:45:56.672
or judge like this.

00:46:35.722 --> 00:46:37.652
I thought you were naïve.

00:46:38.392 --> 00:46:40.262
Letting everyone walk all over you.

00:46:41.122 --> 00:46:42.656
But just now—

00:46:43.129 --> 00:46:44.132
not at all.

00:46:48.162 --> 00:46:48.832
Ping.

00:46:52.572 --> 00:46:53.142
Yes?

00:47:00.012 --> 00:47:01.152
Want to run lines?

00:47:37.412 --> 00:47:38.412
I’m sorry.

00:47:49.753 --> 00:47:51.762
Can I have one more chance?

00:48:14.842 --> 00:48:17.362
Was that my first kiss with P’Charm?

00:48:28.742 --> 00:48:30.952
Was that real?

00:48:32.044 --> 00:48:34.214
Or is it just her acting?

00:48:52.082 --> 00:48:53.442
Focus, Charm.

00:48:54.222 --> 00:48:55.714
It's just beingclose to her.

00:48:56.448 --> 00:48:57.561
Why—

00:48:57.561 --> 00:49:00.000
can’t I slow my heart down?

00:49:00.377 --> 00:49:04.425
Right now, P’Charm doesn’t feel like some hot high school girl anymore.

00:49:05.132 --> 00:49:06.229
I want to protect her.

00:49:06.229 --> 00:49:09.243
and always being this close with her.

00:49:10.792 --> 00:49:13.922
When did this feeling even start?
