WEBVTT

00:00:25.505 --> 00:00:26.589
Gimme.

00:00:31.136 --> 00:00:32.262
Enjoy.

00:00:34.264 --> 00:00:35.431
Thanks.

00:01:01.457 --> 00:01:04.002
What the hell!

00:01:12.802 --> 00:01:14.596
Who is that? Is he okay?

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:15.847
He's out of it.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.808
He's high out of his mind.

00:01:32.405 --> 00:01:34.240
Hey!

00:01:34.324 --> 00:01:36.910
Sir, you need to control yourself.

00:01:38.786 --> 00:01:40.580
Hand over the cocaine.

00:01:41.706 --> 00:01:43.666
Not unless you have the cash for it.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.543
Just give it to me!

00:01:45.627 --> 00:01:47.420
Quit it and get out!

00:01:47.503 --> 00:01:48.504
Hey!

00:01:54.177 --> 00:01:55.511
What are you doing?

00:02:25.917 --> 00:02:27.460
Shut the hell up!

00:02:36.427 --> 00:02:39.013
It hurts!

00:02:57.073 --> 00:02:57.949
That's freaky.

00:02:58.032 --> 00:02:59.575
Should we call the police?

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:01.035
Or an ambulance.

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:07.625
Damn amateur.

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.544
Learn some restraint.

00:03:10.128 --> 00:03:11.629
{\an8}WHERE IN ROPPONGI IS THIS?
THIS IS CRAZY

00:03:11.713 --> 00:03:14.424
{\an8}CAN'T BELIEVE WE CAN SEE THIS LIVE
THE COMMENTS WON'T STOP LOL

00:03:14.507 --> 00:03:16.050
{\an8}THIS CLUB WILL GET CLOSED DOWN

00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:20.722
Stimulants, narcotics, cannabis.

00:03:22.015 --> 00:03:24.267
People who have used these drugs

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.729
are now estimated
to total two million in Japan.

00:03:28.646 --> 00:03:31.524
The number of people arrested
for drug-related offenses

00:03:31.607 --> 00:03:33.943
is as many as 14,000 yearly.

00:04:26.496 --> 00:04:29.582
{\an8}Igarashi is the guy who got nabbed
for marijuana before, right?

00:04:29.665 --> 00:04:31.793
{\an8}And then cocaine and meth.

00:04:31.876 --> 00:04:33.795
{\an8}What a stereotypical scumbag.

00:04:33.878 --> 00:04:37.340
{\an8}It's horrible what he did to that woman.

00:04:37.882 --> 00:04:40.176
{\an8}I feel sorry for the bereaved families

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:43.179
{\an8}when people like this kill someone
and get a light sentence

00:04:43.262 --> 00:04:44.806
{\an8}due to impaired mental capacity.

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.058
That's absolutely unacceptable!

00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:48.351
Don't get mad at me.

00:04:48.434 --> 00:04:51.854
That said, if that Mad Dog
finds out about this case,

00:04:51.938 --> 00:04:54.065
things will get out of hand quickly.

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:57.318
Excuse me, which division are you from?

00:04:57.402 --> 00:04:59.487
I'm not with the police.

00:05:00.321 --> 00:05:03.741
Well, that's a problem.
Did no one stop you from coming in?

00:05:03.825 --> 00:05:05.993
Only authorized personnel are--

00:05:06.077 --> 00:05:08.663
I'm Kurosaki, a narcotics agent.

00:05:09.497 --> 00:05:10.832
Excuse us, sir.

00:05:17.213 --> 00:05:21.175
According to eyewitnesses, he collapsed
right after inhaling the cocaine.

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:23.845
So the drug caused his death.

00:05:23.928 --> 00:05:24.929
What?

00:05:29.392 --> 00:05:30.601
Why are you here?

00:05:30.685 --> 00:05:32.562
To investigate, obviously.

00:05:32.645 --> 00:05:35.148
The NCD can sit this one out.

00:05:35.231 --> 00:05:37.692
Not as long as cocaine is involved.

00:05:37.775 --> 00:05:39.527
This was a serial stabbing.

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:44.031
The perpetrator died due to an overdose,
so the police get jurisdiction.

00:05:44.115 --> 00:05:47.285
You've got to cuff them
while they're still alive, you know.

00:05:48.494 --> 00:05:50.913
Then get this over with quickly,

00:05:51.747 --> 00:05:53.416
police mutt.

00:05:59.213 --> 00:06:00.339
Get lost,

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.758
Ministry mutt.

00:06:15.688 --> 00:06:18.566
Let the police handle this, dumbass.

00:06:22.486 --> 00:06:24.071
Igarashi, you bastard!

00:06:25.907 --> 00:06:27.825
Causing all this mess.

00:06:28.618 --> 00:06:31.329
What if they start investigating us too?

00:06:31.871 --> 00:06:32.872
Hey.

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:36.209
Oh, are you the Mr. Jellyfish
who contacted me?

00:06:36.292 --> 00:06:37.168
Yes.

00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:40.004
0.2 of speed, right?
First time offer. Let's go with ten.

00:06:40.087 --> 00:06:41.464
Ten? You mean 10,000 yen?

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:48.679
You're a kid.

00:06:50.348 --> 00:06:51.933
Are you an idiot?

00:06:52.016 --> 00:06:53.935
Kids shouldn't be buying speed.

00:06:54.018 --> 00:06:55.019
Listen up.

00:06:56.187 --> 00:06:59.732
You try this just once
and there's no going back.

00:07:02.318 --> 00:07:03.945
Your family, your friends…

00:07:04.612 --> 00:07:06.405
You'll lose them all.

00:07:06.489 --> 00:07:08.324
Why is a dealer lecturing me?

00:07:08.407 --> 00:07:09.283
Shut it.

00:07:09.367 --> 00:07:13.037
Go eat a hamburger, kid.
Then get fat and sleep!

00:07:17.792 --> 00:07:18.834
Wait.

00:07:19.794 --> 00:07:22.797
Crap, what am I doing?

00:07:29.178 --> 00:07:31.806
Can't do math
'cause you never went to high school?

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:32.890
Piece of shit.

00:07:35.393 --> 00:07:36.936
I'm sorry.

00:07:37.019 --> 00:07:39.939
But two million per month is a bit much.

00:07:40.022 --> 00:07:41.482
Don't speak.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.526
Sorry.

00:07:43.609 --> 00:07:45.570
I told you not to speak!

00:07:51.617 --> 00:07:52.827
Come on now.

00:07:53.411 --> 00:07:56.122
Enough with the overacting.

00:07:57.582 --> 00:08:02.503
I guess you just can't forget
the good ol' acting days, huh?

00:08:04.171 --> 00:08:06.048
You know what, fine.

00:08:06.674 --> 00:08:08.759
I'll give you a scene to act.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.014
Go on. Drink this.

00:08:14.265 --> 00:08:16.142
What? But…

00:08:16.684 --> 00:08:19.020
- That's…
- Ready?

00:08:19.812 --> 00:08:20.938
Action.

00:08:22.732 --> 00:08:24.358
Please let me off.

00:08:32.783 --> 00:08:33.618
There.

00:08:34.744 --> 00:08:35.828
Ready?

00:08:36.495 --> 00:08:37.330
Action.

00:08:55.514 --> 00:08:57.642
Good stuff, huh?

00:08:58.517 --> 00:09:02.271
That's a good expression
for a washed-up former actor.

00:09:03.314 --> 00:09:05.441
Let's get another angle next, yeah?

00:09:08.778 --> 00:09:10.363
What's with those eyes?

00:09:11.864 --> 00:09:15.284
Did you forget who gave
your debt-ridden ass some work?

00:09:15.368 --> 00:09:16.619
It was me.

00:09:17.828 --> 00:09:21.540
You've been knee-deep
in crime all this time.

00:09:22.708 --> 00:09:25.211
Don't start thinking you can escape.

00:09:30.466 --> 00:09:31.926
Two days!

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.012
Get me the rest of the money.

00:09:35.638 --> 00:09:39.058
Go sell an eyeball or a kidney
if you have to!

00:09:40.393 --> 00:09:43.062
What? You got a problem?

00:09:44.772 --> 00:09:45.981
No, sir.

00:09:53.572 --> 00:09:54.615
Hey, come out!

00:09:56.492 --> 00:09:57.493
Quiet!

00:09:57.576 --> 00:09:59.120
I'm here to collect.

00:09:59.787 --> 00:10:01.247
Don't be so loud.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.792
If you don't pay up,
I'm going to lose my damn organs!

00:10:04.875 --> 00:10:06.335
- Get in.
- What?

00:10:06.419 --> 00:10:07.420
Get in!

00:10:09.004 --> 00:10:10.423
It stinks!

00:10:10.506 --> 00:10:11.882
Keep this open!

00:10:11.966 --> 00:10:12.925
- Stop!
- What?

00:10:13.008 --> 00:10:15.010
God knows who's watching and from where.

00:10:15.094 --> 00:10:18.264
Guys from all over
are trying to get me dead.

00:10:19.473 --> 00:10:21.100
This again?

00:10:21.642 --> 00:10:22.810
You're just being paranoid.

00:10:23.477 --> 00:10:24.645
No.

00:10:25.479 --> 00:10:30.025
Just the other day, there was a sniper
aiming for me from across the river.

00:10:30.109 --> 00:10:32.987
You would be dead already
if that was true.

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:36.157
Why would a sniper go after
a homeless old man like you?

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.742
Don't change the topic.

00:10:38.451 --> 00:10:39.952
I didn't.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:42.997
Forget all that.

00:10:43.789 --> 00:10:46.500
You did bring it, didn't you?

00:10:49.378 --> 00:10:50.337
Here.

00:10:51.046 --> 00:10:52.923
It's ice, not speed.

00:10:54.133 --> 00:10:56.010
Ice, huh?

00:10:56.093 --> 00:10:57.303
Hey!

00:10:57.386 --> 00:10:59.597
Pay up for this month first.

00:11:03.017 --> 00:11:03.893
What?

00:11:03.976 --> 00:11:05.853
Hey, this is nowhere near enough.

00:11:05.936 --> 00:11:07.688
Take any valuables.

00:11:07.772 --> 00:11:08.898
What?

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.900
Like what?

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.776
Valuables?

00:11:22.161 --> 00:11:24.580
Wait, you have a son?

00:11:27.541 --> 00:11:30.586
That? Just throw it away for me.

00:11:38.093 --> 00:11:39.678
Chiaki…

00:11:41.597 --> 00:11:43.265
Takeru!

00:11:52.316 --> 00:11:54.902
Can I even get anything for this?

00:12:01.784 --> 00:12:03.827
Where's Kurosaki when we need him?

00:12:03.911 --> 00:12:06.580
{\an8}He hasn't checked in, as per usual.

00:12:06.664 --> 00:12:09.166
{\an8}- Screw that!
- Why are you yelling at me?

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.335
I know where Igarashi got the cocaine.

00:12:11.418 --> 00:12:13.796
You went off on your own again?

00:12:13.879 --> 00:12:15.965
You can't just be biting at everything.

00:12:16.048 --> 00:12:17.758
That's why they call you Mad Dog!

00:12:17.841 --> 00:12:20.594
He's just a stray dog with a sharp nose.

00:12:20.678 --> 00:12:22.054
What's the address?

00:12:22.137 --> 00:12:24.557
Room 203, Yuzuki Apartments,
3-Chome, Nerima City.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.142
They're probably just cogs
in the machine, anyway.

00:12:27.226 --> 00:12:30.854
Mr. Inaba, the cogs
will lead us to the machine.

00:12:30.938 --> 00:12:32.064
What does that mean?

00:12:32.147 --> 00:12:33.774
I shouldn't have to tell you,

00:12:33.857 --> 00:12:37.152
but for our pride as the NCD,
don't let the police get ahead of us!

00:12:37.236 --> 00:12:38.445
Yes, sir!

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:47.621
Mr. Kyonosuke, I finished 40 bags.

00:12:47.705 --> 00:12:50.374
- Is that enough for the 0.1 net bags?
- Yes.

00:12:50.457 --> 00:12:52.126
Make 20 bags of one gram gross next.

00:12:52.209 --> 00:12:53.252
Okay.

00:12:54.044 --> 00:12:55.921
Hey, hands off the merchandise!

00:12:56.005 --> 00:12:57.881
Relax, I paid for it.

00:13:03.929 --> 00:13:04.763
Want some?

00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:07.433
I don't use it. I just sell it.

00:13:09.893 --> 00:13:12.271
Hey, you! I told you to use water.

00:13:12.354 --> 00:13:14.898
Yes, but that's kind of a pain.

00:13:14.982 --> 00:13:18.277
If a customer gets busted,
they'll do DNA tests on that.

00:13:19.445 --> 00:13:22.114
Can't we just use a courier service?

00:13:22.197 --> 00:13:23.449
Use your brain.

00:13:23.532 --> 00:13:26.744
Regular mail is harder to track down
compared to a courier.

00:13:26.827 --> 00:13:27.786
You amateur!

00:13:30.247 --> 00:13:31.790
What's up?

00:13:31.874 --> 00:13:33.375
Hey. How did it go?

00:13:33.459 --> 00:13:35.044
Yes, about that…

00:13:35.127 --> 00:13:39.131
I tried to get in touch,
but there were cops there.

00:13:39.673 --> 00:13:40.674
What?

00:13:40.758 --> 00:13:41.925
I ran away.

00:13:42.801 --> 00:13:44.178
Hang on now.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.222
Did you check if the cops tailed you?

00:13:47.306 --> 00:13:49.058
It's fine!

00:14:21.298 --> 00:14:23.801
Wait, did that high schooler just…

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:25.511
Do we arrest him?

00:14:25.594 --> 00:14:27.763
No, he's probably a regular student.

00:14:27.846 --> 00:14:29.431
- Let him go.
- Let's go, then.

00:14:46.991 --> 00:14:49.284
- Don't move!
- Hey, wait!

00:14:49.368 --> 00:14:50.452
Stop right there!

00:14:54.206 --> 00:14:55.249
Wait!

00:14:56.083 --> 00:14:58.252
- Let me go!
- Watch out!

00:15:02.798 --> 00:15:04.466
This is obstruction of official duties!

00:15:06.844 --> 00:15:08.387
No! Help me!

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:11.390
Who do you think--

00:15:15.686 --> 00:15:19.273
Regional Bureau of Health and Welfare,
Narcotics Control Department.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.862
Wait, where's Mr. Kurosaki?

00:15:28.282 --> 00:15:29.408
Hey.

00:15:32.244 --> 00:15:34.329
You just left Yuzuki Apartments, right?

00:15:34.413 --> 00:15:36.957
What? No, I didn't.

00:15:37.541 --> 00:15:38.959
Put your hands on that wall.

00:15:40.586 --> 00:15:41.628
Okay.

00:15:47.843 --> 00:15:48.844
Shit!

00:15:55.684 --> 00:15:57.936
Nimble and flashy moves, but too sloppy.

00:16:03.859 --> 00:16:04.777
Is that it?

00:16:11.658 --> 00:16:13.077
Screw you.

00:16:22.795 --> 00:16:24.171
Shit!

00:16:26.882 --> 00:16:27.841
All right.

00:16:28.509 --> 00:16:29.968
Arrest me, then.

00:16:32.012 --> 00:16:34.139
Ouch. What the hell, man?

00:16:44.775 --> 00:16:48.112
{\an8}Was it you who sold drugs
to Keiichi Igarashi, the rapper?

00:16:48.737 --> 00:16:51.365
{\an8}Hey, are police detectives
allowed to be this violent?

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:56.245
I'm not a police detective.
I'm a narcotics agent with the Ministry.

00:16:57.996 --> 00:16:59.081
Narcotics agent?

00:17:01.667 --> 00:17:04.211
Talk when you feel like it.

00:17:04.294 --> 00:17:06.964
{\an8}- About what?
- Don't talk if you don't want to.

00:17:07.047 --> 00:17:08.298
{\an8}About what, damn it!

00:17:08.382 --> 00:17:10.300
{\an8}Everything you know.

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:13.929
I've got nothing.

00:17:14.012 --> 00:17:17.349
Too bad. Just one gram of meth
makes for a lethal dose.

00:17:17.432 --> 00:17:21.186
{\an8}Hey, what are you doing back there?

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:24.231
You're dead for sure
if I inject this into you.

00:17:26.066 --> 00:17:27.526
As if you would.

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:28.986
{\an8}That hurts!

00:17:29.069 --> 00:17:30.904
Ouch.

00:17:30.988 --> 00:17:32.322
Are you completely insane?!

00:17:32.406 --> 00:17:33.407
Here goes.

00:17:34.074 --> 00:17:35.868
Stop! Don't put that in my body!

00:17:35.951 --> 00:17:38.120
{\an8}Don't you sell this to your customers?

00:17:38.203 --> 00:17:39.246
{\an8}Wait, no.

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:41.540
You can't just kill a person.

00:17:41.623 --> 00:17:44.126
No, I'm not going to kill anyone.

00:17:44.209 --> 00:17:49.298
It's common for drug dealers
to die by overdosing on their own supply.

00:17:50.007 --> 00:17:51.884
Don't move. You'll break the needle.

00:17:51.967 --> 00:17:54.136
You're insane, you fucking psycho!

00:17:54.219 --> 00:17:55.637
Yes, I'm insane.

00:17:55.721 --> 00:17:59.808
I'll even become a "fucking psycho"
against people like you drug dealers.

00:18:00.684 --> 00:18:01.935
You're bluffing.

00:18:02.019 --> 00:18:03.395
No, I'm not.

00:18:05.731 --> 00:18:07.900
Who's the one controlling your strings?

00:18:09.568 --> 00:18:10.527
No idea.

00:18:10.611 --> 00:18:13.363
Oh, yeah? Then die.

00:18:13.447 --> 00:18:14.865
Okay, I'll talk!

00:18:14.948 --> 00:18:15.991
I'll talk, damn it.

00:18:16.074 --> 00:18:17.826
Who are you working for?

00:18:19.995 --> 00:18:21.747
Guy named Matsubara.

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:24.583
There, I talked. Now, take out the needle.

00:18:24.666 --> 00:18:25.876
- Take it out!
- Not yet.

00:18:25.959 --> 00:18:27.544
Why? I already told you!

00:18:27.628 --> 00:18:28.879
I'll give you a chance.

00:18:30.172 --> 00:18:31.006
What?

00:18:31.089 --> 00:18:33.008
I'll use your connection to Matsubara

00:18:33.091 --> 00:18:36.178
and take down the drug cartel
connected to Igarashi.

00:18:36.678 --> 00:18:37.888
I need you…

00:18:39.973 --> 00:18:41.767
to become my "S."

00:18:42.768 --> 00:18:43.769
"S"?

00:18:44.478 --> 00:18:45.479
What's an S?

00:18:45.562 --> 00:18:46.521
A spy.

00:18:46.605 --> 00:18:49.149
What? Screw that. Why would I--

00:18:51.026 --> 00:18:54.154
Die here as a junkie or live on as my S.

00:18:54.238 --> 00:18:55.530
Decide right now.

00:18:57.491 --> 00:18:58.617
Okay.

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.160
Okay, what?

00:19:02.955 --> 00:19:04.039
I will…

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:06.750
become your S.

00:19:06.833 --> 00:19:08.669
If you run, you'll be a wanted man.

00:19:08.752 --> 00:19:12.381
I'll leak to the criminal underworld
that you were a spy.

00:19:12.464 --> 00:19:14.841
They won't leave a traitor alive.

00:19:14.925 --> 00:19:19.304
Without a place in either world,
you'll either die or go to prison.

00:19:22.432 --> 00:19:23.767
Shit.

00:19:27.145 --> 00:19:28.814
You're mad.

00:19:30.899 --> 00:19:33.318
My enemies are mad.

00:19:33.402 --> 00:19:35.487
No choice but to be mad in turn.

00:19:37.114 --> 00:19:38.198
Ouch.

00:19:41.201 --> 00:19:42.286
But…

00:19:43.829 --> 00:19:45.872
What exactly do you want me to do?

00:19:46.915 --> 00:19:49.209
You'll be my dog from today onwards.

00:19:52.004 --> 00:19:55.048
{\an8}This is Hibiki Kaga's
Resound! Info Catchman.

00:19:55.132 --> 00:19:58.719
{\an8}Next week, we'll take in the appeal
of the Mikami Ginza shopping district

00:19:58.802 --> 00:20:00.012
{\an8}and catch, catch!

00:20:00.095 --> 00:20:03.181
{\an8}I said "catch," but here I am punching.

00:20:04.141 --> 00:20:05.559
See you next week.

00:20:07.519 --> 00:20:08.812
And cut!

00:20:08.895 --> 00:20:10.439
- Nice.
- Good work.

00:20:10.522 --> 00:20:12.107
- Was that good?
- It was great.

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:13.817
Good. Looking sharp today.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:15.193
- You think?
- Excuse me.

00:20:15.277 --> 00:20:17.321
- Can I get a picture with you?
- Of course.

00:20:17.404 --> 00:20:18.780
- Thank you.
- No problem.

00:20:18.864 --> 00:20:21.616
Your face looks much smaller in person.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:23.744
Really? I'm glad. Thanks.

00:20:23.827 --> 00:20:25.662
- May I?
- Yes, of course.

00:20:25.746 --> 00:20:28.206
Here goes. Say cheese.

00:20:29.875 --> 00:20:31.877
- Okay! Thanks.
- Thank you.

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.546
- You a student?
- Yes, at a nearby girls' college.

00:20:34.629 --> 00:20:36.256
Really? Neat.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.759
Hey, I'm going to grab a bite.
Want to join me?

00:20:38.842 --> 00:20:39.801
What?

00:20:41.386 --> 00:20:42.554
Really?

00:20:42.637 --> 00:20:43.722
- Absolutely.
- May I?

00:20:43.805 --> 00:20:45.932
Of course. Where's my phone again…

00:20:46.016 --> 00:20:47.684
Oh, I'll DM you.

00:20:47.768 --> 00:20:49.519
- DM? Sure. Later, then.
- Okay.

00:20:49.603 --> 00:20:54.232
The dealers we arrested all claim that
their leader fled the scene right before.

00:20:54.983 --> 00:20:58.278
Maybe he disguised himself
as the high schooler you saw.

00:20:58.362 --> 00:21:00.822
Kurosaki told us to let him be.

00:21:00.906 --> 00:21:01.823
Kurosaki?

00:21:01.907 --> 00:21:03.033
I did not.

00:21:03.116 --> 00:21:05.035
Don't just tell a bald-faced lie!

00:21:05.118 --> 00:21:07.704
You weren't on the scene
when we raided them, right?

00:21:07.788 --> 00:21:09.122
- Kurosaki?
- I was there!

00:21:09.206 --> 00:21:10.123
Stop lying!

00:21:10.207 --> 00:21:11.124
Where were you?

00:21:11.208 --> 00:21:13.293
Chasing the high schooler. But I lost him.

00:21:13.794 --> 00:21:15.420
Oh, for heaven's sake.

00:21:15.504 --> 00:21:17.506
Did the dealers give up their supplier?

00:21:17.589 --> 00:21:23.261
No, they all say that their leader was
the only one in contact with the supplier.

00:21:23.845 --> 00:21:24.805
Damn it.

00:21:25.305 --> 00:21:27.682
If only you had caught that high schooler.

00:21:27.766 --> 00:21:29.017
- I'll leave.
- We--

00:21:29.101 --> 00:21:30.560
I'm still talking, Kurosaki!

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:34.606
That's… That's an "Ah!"

00:21:52.999 --> 00:21:54.167
Sorry about that.

00:21:54.918 --> 00:21:56.169
Not a problem.

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:58.839
I ate some sea urchin while you were gone.

00:21:58.922 --> 00:22:00.632
It's fresh and delicious.

00:22:00.715 --> 00:22:01.716
Really?

00:22:02.801 --> 00:22:04.261
I'll have some, then.

00:22:17.774 --> 00:22:22.154
Premium sea urchin
has a rather mature taste.

00:22:22.904 --> 00:22:24.823
Maybe a bit too mature for me.

00:22:24.906 --> 00:22:27.117
Does it taste too much of alum?

00:22:30.453 --> 00:22:32.247
Here, have some.

00:22:32.747 --> 00:22:34.749
- Come on.
- Wait a second.

00:22:37.794 --> 00:22:40.213
{\an8}Nice. Have some more.

00:23:04.779 --> 00:23:07.991
{\an8}I see she has cocaine
circulating in her body.

00:23:09.868 --> 00:23:11.578
{\an8}Should I give her some more?

00:23:31.514 --> 00:23:33.600
{\an8}Hey, Aoi?

00:23:34.184 --> 00:23:37.312
{\an8}Have a sip of this delicious water.

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:42.567
{\an8}Meet Kaga and make him ingest cocaine.

00:23:42.651 --> 00:23:43.652
{\an8}Get it on video.

00:23:43.735 --> 00:23:46.613
{\an8}I'll get killed if they find out
I'm connected to you.

00:23:46.696 --> 00:23:49.783
{\an8}MPD, Narcotics and Firearms Division,
Akito Katsuragi.

00:23:49.866 --> 00:23:51.534
{\an8}Why am I getting arrested?

00:23:52.244 --> 00:23:54.955
{\an8}You're a dead man.

00:23:55.038 --> 00:24:00.961
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO ACTUAL PERSONS,
GROUPS, OR CASES IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL

00:24:01.044 --> 00:24:02.003
