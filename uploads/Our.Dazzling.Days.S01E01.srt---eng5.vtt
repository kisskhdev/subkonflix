[Episode 1]

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.120
[2007 Japan]

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.430
10 seconds left in the 5th round.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.479
Can Tanaka hold on?

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.840
Rear hand! Miura threw a heavy punch!

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.060
Tanaka is down! Miura wins!

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.009
The challenger for the next match
is Miyamura Masao.

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.610
He will face Zhang Xiaoman from China,

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.640
who is riding a ten-fight winning streak.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.650
Zhang Xiaoman
must be taken down in the 3rd round.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.150
The gym has put

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:10.699
all its funds on this fight.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.340
No other outcome is acceptable.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.430
The stakes this time

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.740
have broken all previous records.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.800
Yes.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.160
Everything has been arranged.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.910
Xiaoman,

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.560
have you heard this saying?

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.840
"Insanity is doing the same thing

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.260
over and over

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.360
and expecting different results."

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.980
I think you and I have been doing

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.640
the same thing all along.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.710
Maybe it's time for us to wake up

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.030
and live a different life.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.410
First up is Zhang Xiaoman

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.400
from KOB Boxing Gym in China!

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.630
Xiaoman! Xiaoman! Xiaoman!

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.310
Go, Xiaoman!

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.150
Xiaoman! Xiaoman! Xiaoman!

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.840
Next is the famous Miyamura Masao.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.240
He was knocked down
by Zhang Xiaoman in a previous match.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.560
This time it's his revenge fight.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.040
Get Yu Qiangbei here!

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.760
Yes!

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.390
Boss, we didn't find Yu Qiangbei.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:41.000
What?

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:42.340
Get out of my way!

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.000
Xiaoman,

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.070
didn't Yu Qiangbei
make things clear to you?

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.890
Those who don't follow the rules
end up in Tokyo Bay!

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.090
Translate it for him.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.890
Xiaoman,

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.120
he wants you to lose.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.390
He's asking if you
don't understand the rules.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.570
He says your family
will be collecting your body.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:00.770
I never throw a fight.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.320
He doesn't throw fights.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.310
I've bet everything on this match.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.600
You must lose this fight.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.200
Please.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.750
Xiaoman!

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.480
Name your price—I'll pay!

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.800
Start!

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.520
The winner is Zhang Xiaoman!

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:32.240
Xiaoman! Xiaoman! Xiaoman!

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.560
Stop! Catch him!

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.830
Pay up! Stop! Hurry!

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.870
Don't run! Stop! Get him!

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:54.950
Stop!

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:57.920
Stop! Don't run!

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:13.920
Stop!

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.240
Don't hit me! Don't hit me!

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.190
Xiaoman,

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.800
why did you team up with Yu Qiangbei?

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.870
You think you can escape?

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.500
The money. The money.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.330
I'll give it all back to you.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.430
Spare me.

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:45.630
I don't throw fights.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.360
Don't hit me.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:51.270
Get him!

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.800
My name is Zhang Xiaoman.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:23.330
I was born in a massive factory
in the western suburbs of Tiecheng.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:23.660
We call it Western Tiecheng.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.360
[East Chemical Plant]

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.010
Here, the factory and the residential area
are combined,

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:27.950
[East Integrated Chemical Plant]

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.360
with all the necessary facilities.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.950
In the late 1960s,

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.809
the Fifth Industrial Ministry rushed

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:34.140
to relocate our factory

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.679
from the China-Soviet border
to a remote valley in Northeast China,

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:40.140
and hastily built this "Western Tiecheng."

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:41.909
My grandparents

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:43.429
came here just like that.

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.800
That generation of workers,
full of passion,

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.970
carried the backbone
of the Third Front Construction

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.090
amid the roar of the machines.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:55.550
Outsiders called us
the "East Chemical Plant,"

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:56.750
but they had no idea
what we actually produced—

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:58.630
it was a secret unit.

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.550
Only after the 1980s, when military
industries shifted to civilian use,

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:05.410
did the factory gradually
lose its veil of secrecy.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:06.960
People then realized that

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.030
our factory

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:11.280
was one of the nation's
top gunpowder production bases.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.760
All the children here were proud of it.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:16.410
This is my home.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.360
Like most factory kids,

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.120
I was born in the staff hospital

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.980
and grew up running wild

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.550

through the factory area.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.390
Zhang Xiaoman, stay right there!

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:30.320
You little brat!

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:31.220
You've actually...

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.890
You've actually learned to lie to me now?

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:34.660
Playing these little tricks on me, huh?

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.020
I'll smack you silly!

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:37.500
Stay right there!

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.330
Come back here, Zhang Xiaoman!

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:40.490
Give me back my shoe!

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:47.430
Here!

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.960
Dad, I'm leaving!

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.370
I'll be waiting for you!

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.080
Xia Lei, just you wait!

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.720
We just moved in
and you're already causing trouble.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.180
We brought all this stuff over
from the old factory, bit by bit.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:05.340
Fine.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.820
This new boy is Xia Lei.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:10.720
His mother worked at the staff hospital,

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.550
and his father
was a driver in the transportation team.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:14.790
We met during an escape.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.670
Back then, I watched this quiet boy

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:19.910
following behind me, huffing and puffing,

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.370
so honest it made me laugh.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:23.360
Who would have thought

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.480
we'd become the closest of friends.

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:37.960
Who are you?

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:40.070
Why are you following me?

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.220
I'm not following you.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.320
My mom beat me up

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.220
and then kicked me out.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:49.480
I don't know what to do.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.010
So I'm just walking around.

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:53.030
Then come with me.

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:55.690
Come on.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:58.270
Let's go!

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.940
Is it safe here?

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.150
It's safe. They don't usually come here.

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:06.680
And this place is spacious.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.630
If they come, we can see them

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:09.830
and run away anytime.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.100
Where are you from?

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.630
Are you here visiting relatives?

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.630
No, I used to live in the old factory.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:15.990
Now we've moved here.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.600
No wonder I haven't seen you before.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.360
What's your name?

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.560
What grade are you in?

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:22.150
My name is Xia Lei.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.250
I'm in 4th grade.

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:24.780
What a coincidence.

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:26.790
Your surname is Xia too?

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:27.910
No, I'm not a Xia.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.340
My name is Zhang Xiaoman.

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.540
I'm also in 4th grade.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:33.090
If anyone bullies you,
just mention my name.

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:34.240
Come.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.640
Let's go play over there.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:37.350
Are you crazy?

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:40.000
You need to hold it like this
and eat it this way.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.340
It has the fragrance of corn husks.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.940
And it won't burn your hands.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.150
Fellow workers,

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.600
this is the East Integrated Chemical Plant
broadcasting station.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.450
The golden autumn brings cool air
and sweet-scented osmanthus.

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:55.790
During the recently concluded

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:58.270
16-day Beijing Asian Games,

00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.960
we all witnessed

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.240
the fighting spirit of our athletes

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.600
and felt proud of their achievements.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.300
Now for a vaccination announcement.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.480
All primary school students

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.390
born in 1980 must be accompanied

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:12.880
by a parent

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:15.600
to get vaccinated at the staff hospital
this week.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.440
Come on, class is starting.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.370
Take your seats.

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:18.240
The teacher is here!

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.350
Put that down quickly!

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:20.350
Stop running.

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:27.470
Alright, everyone.

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:31.320
This is Xia Lei.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:33.200
His parents were transferred for work,

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.840
so he's been placed in our class.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.790
Let's give him a warm welcome.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:39.510
Xia Lei!

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.600
Xia Lei,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.600
please introduce yourself.

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:49.630
My name is Xia Lei.

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.890
Anything else?

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.750
I'm male.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:12:59.860
That's enough.

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:02.970
We got it. Well...

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Go take that seat over there, okay?

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.190
Go ahead.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.790
Here.

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:14.360
Since we have a new student joining us,

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:17.550
I want to emphasize
our confidentiality rules again.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.590
Our factory requires everyone
to maintain secrecy,

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:22.960
and primary school students
are no exception.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.000
If you visit relatives in other places

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.240
and your relatives ask you

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.790
what our factory produces,

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:31.390
you must answer
"pesticides and fertilizers."

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:34.670
Nothing else should be mentioned,
understand?

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:36.000
Yes.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:36.840
Ma'am.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:38.000
Didn't you tell us

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.630
that we should be honest and trustworthy?

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.150
We shouldn't lie.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.600
You should be honest with your family

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.860
and the organization.

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:47.870
But with enemies and spies,
of course you must keep secrets.

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:48.630
Ma'am, tell me,

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.240
if my second great-aunt asks me,

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.870
should I tell her the truth?

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.610
Your second great-aunt?
Better not tell her.

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:56.480
Distant relatives don't count as family.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.320
They might even be enemies or spies.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.440
Ma'am, why would distant relatives

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.170
possibly be enemies and spies?

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:01.910
Because

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:04.330
we don't know distant relatives very well.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.760
Who's making that sound?

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:06.980
Then why couldn't close relatives

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.650
be enemies or spies?

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:10.390
Zhang Xiaoman,

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:12.240
are you deliberately being difficult?

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.840
Just do as I say

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.700
and don't ask so many questions.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:15.910
But ma'am, look,

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:17.480
my grandma is a close relative of mine,
right?

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.570
If I tell my grandma,

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:19.840
and she tells her sister,

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.200
isn't that the same?

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.300
Zhang Xiaoman,

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:25.790
Are you stupid

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:27.390
or are you arguing on purpose?

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:28.250
How about this?

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:29.370
Let me tell you.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.770
Whenever someone asks you anything,

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:32.500
just say "I'm a little piglet."

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:34.030
"I know nothing but eat."

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:34.840
Got it?

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.720
Xia Lei, where's your hometown?

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.750
Before, it was Heilongjiang...

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:42.880
You okay, Dongdong?

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:46.860
Step aside!

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.320
Who's that?

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:52.870
That's our factory's celebrity,

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:53.750
Mr. Ding.

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:56.870
In our factory,
you need to avoid two things: big trucks,

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:58.200
and Mr. Ding.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.480
Why?

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.960
Mr. Ding fought in the war

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.560
and was even a platoon leader.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.230
So is everyone afraid of him?

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.080
No.

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:08.530
Mr. Ding and his fiancée had an agreement

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:10.360
to get married
when he returned from the war.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.140
But who would've known

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:12.390
that just when they were about to win,

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:13.870
the enemy's last bullet

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:14.840
wounded him.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.130
So everyone sympathizes with him?

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.150
Not exactly.

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:20.080
After Mr. Ding got injured,

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.740
he needs a monthly injection.

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.390
But it only lasts for an hour.

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:25.440
During that hour,

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:26.600
no one dares to stop Mr. Ding,

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.630
who is in a hurry
to go home to take care of his "business".

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:29.460
There's gonna be a show.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:30.520
What's happening?

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.750
Hey, you on the bike!

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:43.350
Don't run!

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:44.480
Stop right there!

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.010
Do you know who you slapped?

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.910
A wise dog doesn't block the road.
Don't you know?

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:49.010
If you delay me one minute,

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:50.670
tomorrow I'll slap all three of you!

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:52.080
That's badass!

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:52.910
Get lost!

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:55.030
How dare you talk like that?

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:56.690
What kind of attitude is this?

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.120
Everyone, be the judge!

00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:59.790
Just because someone blocked him,

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:02.670
he actually dared to slap Director Meng,
who just transferred here!

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.270
Look, that's my brother,

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.920
the big boss of our East Chemical Plant.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.660
He's really tough.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.840
What are you guys doing here?

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.500
We're just watching the show.

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:19.510
Have you learned roller skating yet?

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:20.060
Almost.

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:21.600
I've fallen enough times.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.910
Once you've got it down,
I'll get you a pair of skates.

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:24.720
Thanks, Da.

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.030
Da, can you get me a pair too?

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.880
What do you need them for?

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:30.360
How many times have I told you

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.600
not to hang around here after school?

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.320
Got it?

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:33.990
Go home and study.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:38.670
Bye, Da.

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:51.560
You're back?

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:54.510
Dad, you didn't go drinking?

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:56.080
I did.

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:00.600
Uncle Wang's wife

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.390
dragged him away.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:03.910
We wrapped it up.

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:12.310
I'm going to my room to take a nap.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.130
Clean this up and get some rest early.

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:19.869
Sure.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.270
When Mom was around,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.600
My dad was the

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.880
best level-eight fitter in the factory.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:54.080
Even his workshop director
had to respect him.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.000
But after my mom left,

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:58.880
he became a "level-eight alcoholic,"

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:01.270
always glued to his bottle.

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:04.000
Whenever he got drunk,
he'd go on a rampage

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:06.370
and hit me with his electrician's belt.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.340
I often wondered,

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:11.870
if my mom hadn't left,

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:13.920
would my dad still be

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.750
a level-eight fitter,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.880
and would I have been spared
from being beaten every day?

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.880
The 24th anniversary celebration

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.560
of the East Integrated Chemical Plant
is coming soon.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.930
[Congratulations on the 24th Anniversary]

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:24.590
[of East Integrated Chemical Plant's
Founding]

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:27.440
All staff are encouraged to participate.

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.750
Line up!

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:32.390
Come on. Look at me.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.370
Straighten your lines.

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:35.650
Dress right, dress!

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:36.880
Dress!

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:38.000
Eyes front!

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:38.760
Front!

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:40.920
Very good.

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.170
See how well Wang Dongdong is doing?

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:45.000
Alright, today everyone

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:46.160
has done very well.

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:47.680
Did you all watch

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.200
the Beijing Asian Games closing ceremony

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.000
last night?

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.440
Yes!

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.240
Was it good?

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.480
Yes!

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:54.270
You all

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:56.510
should be like those performers
at the closing ceremony,

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:58.750
unified and full of energy,

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:01.000
when you appear
at our factory celebration.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:01.590
Alright?

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:02.700
Yes!

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.240
Very good.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.590
Let me tell you something.

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:12.190
Don't just stand there
watching the fun later.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.510
When you see the director,

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:15.790
you need to apologize properly.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:19.680
Ms. Zhang,

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.270
please keep an eye on the children.

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:22.200
Don't let them run around.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.640
Your performance is second on the program.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.480
Alright, Secretary Liu.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.880
Don't worry. Come on, kids.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:26.590
Xiaodan,

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.000
you sing very well.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.560
Sing your best. Go for it.

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:30.420
Sure, sir.

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:31.790
Line up, everyone.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.060
Director Meng.

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:38.170
Mr. Ding?

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.490
Wh-What can I do for you?

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:43.160
It's nothing important.

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:47.350
Just the other day, I...

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.350
Director Meng, Chief Engineer Yan,

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:50.920
it's your turn to go on stage.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.510
Everything's ready. Please.

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:54.640
Mr. Ding, we'll talk later.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:55.440
I need to go on stage now.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.700
Alright, you go ahead.

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:03.790
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:04.020
I'm very pleased

[Congratulations on the 24th Anniversary]

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:06.190

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:07.410

[of East Integrated Chemical Plant's

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.550
-Ma'am, could you sweep later?
-Please don't sweep now.

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:50.790
We want to collect some firecrackers.

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:51.680
Fine, go ahead.

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:52.640

Ma'am, can I take
these two buckets home first?

00:23:58.270 --> 00:23:59.750
I'll leave these 5 popsicles here.

-No.
-I'll come back for them soon.

Why is this kid so indecisive?

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.550
Then don't take them at all.

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:12.730
It's not the end of the world
if you don't eat them.

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:13.680
Who can't afford a few popsicles?

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:14.440
Just take them away.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:15.440

Fine if you won't help.

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:19.440
I'll figure it out myself.

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.350
Seriously.

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:24.380
This kid is so fussy.

She won't even help.

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:28.960
Alright, stop checking.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.420
-They're all here.
-Okay.

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.760
Always so stingy.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.400
Hey, kid.

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:42.710
Who are your parents?

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:43.790
Is it too cold for you?

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:45.000
It's all because you!

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.880
Why are you yelling? What does that have to do with me?

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:47.740
Who's yelling?

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:48.720
Speak properly.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.180
This is how I talk. Bite me!

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.400
I'll tear your mouth apart. You believe me?

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.550
Go ahead, try it.

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:53.490
Try it, I dare you!

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:54.590
I will! Just watch me!

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:55.590
Come here! Whose brat are you?

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:56.590
Come here!

00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:57.110
Don't go! Come!

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.710
Come here!

00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:58.720
Come here!

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:01.380
-Come on!
-The White Bone Demon wants to kill me!

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:08.490
Thank you, Grandma.

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:10.010
Try this. See if it's good.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.590
So sweet.

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:14.910
Look at you.

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:17.960
It's such a nice fish, and you didn't cook it for the child.

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.560
You've been drinking all day

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:20.720
What are you saying?

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.850
Thank you, Grandma.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.490
If I knew how to cook it, I would.

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:24.690
Then drink less.

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:26.460
Bring the child to my place.

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:27.450
I'll teach you.

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:28.660
Alright.

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:30.280
Grandma.

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:31.000
No, no, no.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:31.640
Here.

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:34.460
I prefer the tail.

00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:37.480
See? Thick pieces of fish

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:38.350
don't absorb the flavor.

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:40.890
The head and tail taste the best.

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:43.240
Oh, Grandma.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.200
You have no idea.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.200
Today, when I went to get ice cream,

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.190
I got into a fight with that person from the collective enterprise.

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.880
Why?

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:50.490
What?

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.540
What collective enterprise?

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.600
I'm telling you, that woman—

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:55.640
she was so mean.

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.330
She had these painted fingernails.

00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:58.880
I just asked her to hold my ice cream,

00:25:58.880 --> 00:25:59.770
but she wouldn't do it.

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:00.770
She just refused.

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:03.920
So I had to eat 5 popsicles right there.

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:04.570
What?

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:05.790
Five of them?

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:08.180
Were you crazy?

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.660
Weren't you afraid of getting diarrhea?

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:12.560
It was fine. I just needed a quick pee.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.560
So silly.

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:14.750
Silly.

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:15.610
Zhang Xiaoman.

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:17.550
Let me tell you.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.680
Stop arguing with people all the time.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.330
Be polite to adults.

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:23.500
Got it.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.270
I'll go.

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.040
Who is it?

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:34.200
Why did you follow me home?

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:36.750
Isn't this Zhang Jiaming's place?

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:37.510
Let me tell you.

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:39.690
Complaining to my dad won't help.

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:40.290
Grandma!

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:41.250
She's the one from the
collective enterprise

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:42.200
-who bullied me!
-Go take a look.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.480
Who is it?

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:49.920
Wh-why are you here?

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.750
Don't you have work at the office?

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:53.680
I just came to drop off some things.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.740
You are too polite.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:56.790
Come in.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.530
I finally found this place.

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.640
Mom. Come in.

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:06.760
This is my friend, Li.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.240
Hello, ma'am.

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:10.720
Well, I got something from my office,

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.590
like sausages and apples.

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:13.850
So I brought some over.

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:14.360
Xiaoman.

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:15.030
Thank you.

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:16.790
Put the things over there.

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.840
Perfect timing for dinner.

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:20.630
Join us.

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:21.580
Don't move.

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:22.460
Just sit there.

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:25.050
Why is a kid taking up so much space?

00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:26.340
Come sit with me.

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:27.230
Come, sit here.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.690
I came right at dinnertime.

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.000
Put my bag over there.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:31.590
Okay.

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.520
Have a seat then.

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:36.350
What are you waiting for?

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:38.480
Go get a bowl and chopsticks for Ms. Li.

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:40.790
This kid has no awareness at all.

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:43.000
Don't you have hands and legs?

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:45.090
Why keep bossing the kid around?

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:49.700
What are you doing?

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:53.550
Dad, get me a different stepmother.

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:55.320
What are you talking about?

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.930
How have Grandma and I been teaching you?

00:27:57.930 --> 00:27:58.790
She's a demon.

00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:00.640
She eats people without spitting out the bones.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.510
Xiaoman.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.230
Don't talk to her like that.

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:06.940
It's okay, ma'am.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:07.960
He's immature.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:09.000
He's just a child.

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:11.880
That being said,

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.070
you still have to keep this kid in line.

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:13.960
Otherwise,

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:15.750
how are we going to get along

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:18.000
as family?

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:19.590
Who's family with you?

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:21.860
Who exactly is your focus in our family?

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:23.110
Me, my grandma, or my dad?

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:24.110
Who are you going to eat?

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:26.570
Zhang Xiaoman, you think I'm being too nice?

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:27.440
Stop it!

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.960
Go! Apologize to Ms. Li.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.790
Why should I apologize to her?

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:33.530
What did I do wrong

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:35.260
that I need to apologize to her?

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.990
I'll teach you a lesson!

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.070
What are you doing?

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:41.470
Sit down!

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:44.570
Sit down. You're acting like a child.

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:46.170
Making such a fuss.

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:48.960
That child is young and doesn't know any better. Are you the same?

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:49.960
It's fine, ma'am.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000
I, well...

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.400
I don't take things personally.

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.200
I never let these things bother me.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.930
It's okay. We will get along better in the future.

00:28:58.100 --> 00:28:58.960
Don't be angry.

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.160
I am Kesai, here to buy vegetables.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.590
Potatoes for 50 cents, greens for 1 yuan.

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:14.400
Time to eat.

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:21.090
Who are you talking to?

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:21.990
No one.

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.440
Mom, let's go eat.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:26.920
Ma'am?

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.660
Why are you here?

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.000
I came to ask Xia Lei to go out and play.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:31.850
Then come in.

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:34.160
No need. I'll just wait for him here.

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:34.750
If you don't come in,

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:35.830
I won't let him go out to play with you.

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:36.570
Did you hear me?

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:37.650
Xiaoman, come.

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:38.550
-Come on.
-Hurry up.

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:39.080
Alright.

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:39.830
Come in.

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:41.570
Don't go this way anymore. It's dangerous.

00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:42.610
Alright, ma'am.

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.400
This child...

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:50.960
What? Afraid the kids can't wait?

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:53.980
You can't even do this?

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.280
Ma'am, I don't need this.

00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.720
What's your name?

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.880
My name is Zhang Xiaoman.

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.600
So you're Xiaoman?

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:06.510
Xia Lei mentions you all the time.

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:08.650
Have you eaten yet?

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.470
We eat late at our house.

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:12.740
Time to eat!

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.830
Then eat at our place.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.070
No need.

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:17.400
That won't do.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.110
Let me tell you, if you don't eat at our house,

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:20.640
I won't let him go out with you.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:21.400
With you waiting here,

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.650
he won't eat properly.

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:23.960
Ma'am, is there anything

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.200
I can help you with?

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:27.310
Set up the table then.

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:27.830
Okay.

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:28.460
Let's go.

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:33.200
Be careful.

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.330
-Be careful.
-Okay.

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:37.480
Help out.

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.310
Coming.

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:40.480
Let me wipe it first.

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:44.480
Ma'am, this cloth for wiping the table

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.400
is cleaner than the one I use to wipe my face.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.790
I sterilized it in the pressure cooker.

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:49.000
Ma'am, let me do it.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:49.680
No need.

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:52.030
Just focus on eating.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:55.640
My mom doesn't trust anyone when it comes to cleanliness.

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:58.810
You dad cook at your house?

00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:00.130
Yes. What about you?

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:03.830
If my grandma doesn't cook,

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.590
-my dad does too.
-Put the meat dish here.

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:07.590
Your father cooks at your house too?

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.090
What about your mom?

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.030
My mom...

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:12.050
isn't home.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.210
Look at those big bites.

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:19.200
Really.

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:19.970
Eat slower.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.100
Or you'll get indigestion.

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:22.800
Uncle, your cooking is amazing.

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:23.550
-Tasty, right?
-Eat slowly.

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:24.270
I have soup over there.

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:24.940
When the soup is ready,

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:26.540
have some. Don't choke on it.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.270
Fire!

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:45.640
You're cheating!

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:47.460
Go! Wang Dongdong!

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:49.720
I won!

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:05.690
Let me tell you.

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:07.070
I've looked into it.

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.260
Making money there is super easy.

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:11.160
It's about 3 days by train.

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:13.550
Once everything's arranged, let's go.

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:17.140
Who is it?

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:19.810
Someone's back?

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:20.960
Xiaoman?

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:23.200
Didn't you say he went to his grandma's?

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.270
He has a key.

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:25.840
How does he have a key?

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.050
It's his home. How can he not have a key?

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:31.970
You go.

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:33.690
Go check it out.

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:34.670
Me?

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:36.640
He's your son, and you want me to check?
You go ahead.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:37.270
Fine.

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:40.830
Come on. Seriously.

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:41.710
Don't worry.

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.700
Xiaoman, you're back?

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:54.590
Didn't you go to your grandma's?

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.260
Xiaoman, you're back?

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:57.710
Are you hungry?

00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:58.570
What do you want for dinner?

00:32:58.570 --> 00:32:59.570
I'll buy something and cook for you.

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:00.430
I'm not eating.

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:01.830
Not hungry?

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.020
Not hungry.

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:05.110
Then don't eat.

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:06.180
Fine.

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.270
That attitude.

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:08.270
Tough guy.

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:10.320
I wonder if you're this tough

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.750
when it comes to studying.

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:12.480
What did you score?

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.940
Did you get perfect marks?

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.100
Did you get perfect marks?

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.600
What do you want? I'll go buy some.

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:24.440
Anything is fine.

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:25.240
Braised ribs?

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:26.650
I make great ribs.

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:28.660
Don't make it too complicated.

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:29.520
Keep it simple.

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:30.830
Let me tell you.

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:32.770
Ribs braised with beans are so good.

00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:33.230
Wait...

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.100
Soybean paste?

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:39.720
Look at this. It's all sticky!

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:42.500
Soybean paste!

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:44.680
Was it you?

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:45.550
It wasn't me!

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:46.440
You dare say it wasn't you?

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:47.550
It really wasn't me!

00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:48.720
Where did the paste come from then?

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.030
I don't know!

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:52.440
It really wasn't me, Dad.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:53.200
Apologize to Mrs. Li.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.000
Do you hear me?

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:55.130
Apologize to her. Do you hear me?

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:55.930
Do you hear me?

00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:57.830
It wasn't me. Why should I apologize?

00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:58.830
Stop hitting him.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.160
Grandma, easy.

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:01.030
Hold on.

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:02.350
He hit me so hard.

00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:04.100
My dad didn't control himself.

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:08.070
Why did you have to provoke that woman?

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.440
Whether I provoked her or not,

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.070
she doesn't like me anyway.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.659
Grandma, I don't want to go home tonight.

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:18.989
Then don't.

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:20.280
Stay here with me.

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.929
Let's see if your dad will get worried.

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:25.510
Grandma,

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:29.330
when Dad was little, did Grandpa beat him like this too?

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.360
Of course not.

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:34.150
Your grandpa adored your dad.

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:37.210
I was the one who did the beating.

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:39.469
So do I take after Grandpa or Dad?

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:40.480
You...

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:43.489
are like your grandpa.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:47.440
All those good qualities your grandpa had

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:50.860
skipped a generation and went to my grandson.

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:54.510
Grandma,

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:57.400
did Grandpa really fight in two of the Three Major Campaigns?

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.070
Yes.

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:01.290
The Liaoshen and Pingjin campaigns—

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:02.830
he was in both of them.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.230
He even fought in the Korean War.

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:06.290
Alright.

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.630
Did he have a gun?

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:09.630
Of course.

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.880
He used all kinds of guns.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.360
Type 55, Type 81,

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:18.180
semi-auto, full-auto,

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:19.330
"turtle box,"

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:20.880
and "Dujuezi".

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:22.630
"Dujuezi"?

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:24.360
What's a "Dujuezi"?

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:27.550
A Dujuezi is homemade

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.440
and shoots one shot at a time.

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:30.710
But that was enough.

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:34.630
Where are those guns now?

00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:37.770
They were all handed over to the government.

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:38.840
Grandpa must've

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.840
killed a lot of reactionaries back then.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.360
I don't know about that.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.030
But your grandpa

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:46.630
never missed a battle he was supposed to fight.

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:48.470
Grandpa was really something.

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:50.390
Grandma, I'm going out to play.

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:53.160
What about your injury?

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:53.840
It's fine.

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:54.480
I take after Grandpa. I don't feel pain.

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.840
Come back early, alright?

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:56.670
Alright!

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:58.440
Such a tough kid.

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:02.380
You...

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:04.710
You were so capable.

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:07.830
How come your son doesn't take after you at all?

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:09.370
You

00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:11.720
should just bless our grandson

00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:16.250
and keep him safe for his whole life.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.280
Books!

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:26.550
Alright.

00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:28.110
Stop fooling around. Class is starting.

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:29.240
The teacher's here.

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:31.280
The teacher's here.

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:34.800
Okay, hurry up and sit down.

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.730
Now, before class,

00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:39.800
I need to announce something.

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:43.550
We're going to select the model student for this semester.

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:45.280
Who would you like to nominate?

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.490
You can make your suggestions.

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.670
I nominate Zhang Wei.

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:50.880
Okay, Zhang Wei.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:52.650
Anyone else?

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:54.480
I nominate Li Xiaohong.

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:55.800
Anyone else?

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:57.230
I nominate Mo Xixi.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:01.100
That's all?

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:04.510
Ma'am, I nominate Xia Lei!

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:06.790
Xiaoman, can you stop messing around?

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:09.590
Only those who are surrendering raise both hands.

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.010
Who raises both hands to nominate someone?

00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:12.700
Okay.

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:14.120
Xia Lei.

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.090
You're back?

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:30.660
Why did you bring it back?

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:32.650
You didn't give it to her?

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:35.730
She didn't take it.

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:40.950
What did the teacher say?

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:43.030
Nothing. She was quite nice.

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:44.920
She said that first,

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:46.960
teachers aren't allowed to accept gifts.

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.090
And second, well...

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:49.590
Xia Lei himself,

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:51.360
his interpersonal relationships...

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:53.510
He only gets along well with Xiaoman.

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:55.660
He doesn't get along with other classmates.

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:57.070
So it's not appropriate to give him that.

00:37:57.070 --> 00:37:58.730
She said she'll see next year.

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:00.150
She had a point.

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:01.680
What point?

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:05.430
Our kid gets perfect scores in every subject.

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:08.150
At his old school, he was a model student every year.

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:09.670
Now he didn't get it this year.

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:11.360
What if he loses

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:13.280
his motivation to study?

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:16.480
It'll affect his college entrance exam in the future.

00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:17.630
You have a point too.

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:19.360
But that's a bit exaggerated.

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.360
Exaggerated? You don't understand.

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.710
Our kid is in

00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:24.450
a very important stage.

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:26.320
This is when independent learning awareness

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:27.520
is being cultivated.

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:31.360
What are you doing? You scared me.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:31.840
Wait.

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:36.350
Why did you come?

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:37.510
I came to see you.

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:38.880
Not selecting you as the model student

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:40.280
shows they have no taste.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:43.840
Here.

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:44.810
I don't want it.

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:45.710
Take it.

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:48.730
Anyway, in my heart you're the best.

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:50.190
You're the model student.

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:51.290
I'm leaving now.

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:53.720
I'll go back home

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:55.980
I'll take you to the bathhouse tomorrow.

00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:10.760
Two more, Dad.

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.150
More?

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:14.150
One last one.

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:15.150
Please.

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:25.960
I'm exhausted. Let's take a break.

00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:29.110
My dad's making stewed ribs for me tonight.

00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:30.640
Come to my place for dinner.

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:31.440
No thanks.

00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:34.480
My grandma specially steamed bean buns and is waiting for me.

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:35.630
Your grandma is so nice.

00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:37.160
Why don't you live with her?

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:39.530
Then my dad would be living alone.

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:44.880
When my dad's not hitting me, he's actually pretty good.

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:47.070
Recently he's been playing harmonica for me.

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:49.000
Maybe he's changed for the better.

00:40:58.290 --> 00:41:00.220
Grandma, why aren't the lights on?

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:03.220
I'm not doing anything.

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.170
Why waste electricity?

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:06.630
Where's my dad?

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:08.670
Your dad left.

00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:11.640
He went south with that demon.

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:14.400
He left you a note.

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:16.430
Let me see.

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.110
Xiaoman,

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:26.400
I'm leaving.

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:30.280
I wanted to wait until you grew up to do this.

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.030
But that's how life is.

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:37.530
East Chemical Plant is too small.

00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:41.010
I don't want to be trapped here my whole life.

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:42.960
I want to go out

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:45.260
and see the world outside.

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.610
Live well with Grandma.

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:49.630
Listen to her.

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:53.210
When I make something of myself out there,

00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:56.550
I'll come back to pick you and Grandma up.

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:21.360
Xiaoman.

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:23.510
You don't need to bring so many things

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:24.960
to my place to live.

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:27.030
Alright, Grandma.

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:28.490
I'll be done packing soon.

00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:53.130
Grandma, be careful.

00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:56.400
Be careful, Grandma.
