00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
(What made you want to work at ROMY?)

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:02.960
Ah.
(Tanouchi Aohiko)

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.520
I got into this industry
because of skincare products.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.130
Because I've had sensitive
skin since I was little.

00:00:08.196 --> 00:00:08.635
(Harada Misa)

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.310
It's probably because I
like cosmetics and makeup.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.390
And I also admired the work of a BA.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.389
Because I like Romy.

00:00:16.436 --> 00:00:17.175
(Aizawa Hitomi)

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.200
Me too.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.405
I also thought, if I work here, would
there be employee discounts or something?

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:22.098
(Takano Marika)

00:00:22.146 --> 00:00:24.735
I started researching makeup
when I was looking for a job.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.275
(Sasaki Shiho)

00:00:25.348 --> 00:00:27.060
And I fell head over heels for it.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.290
Why do I want to be a makeup artist?

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.360
(Nanjo Atsushi)

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.320
Because I think I'm good at it.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.230
Speaking of which,
people in this industry...

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.939
Almost all of them joined
because they love it, right?

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.750
Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to stay.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.360
That's true.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.440
Hmm...

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.060
Indeed, most people
enter this field because they love it.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.520
Hoshina-kun is quite a rare case.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.450
Liking your own job...

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.110
What does that feel like?

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.010
Even if you weren't
interested in makeup at first,

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.490
as long as there's an opportunity,

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.500
you'll surely come to
love this job eventually.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.360
Alright.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.000
"Cosmetic Playlover" Season 2
(Episode 4)

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.840
Well then,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.160
let's all smile today

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.710
and do our best!

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.350
Let's do our best.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.170
Hoshina-kun.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.660
Can you stay a bit
longer for training today?

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.960
Yes, I can.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.689
Excuse me, can someone practice with him?

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:39.700
I can.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.240
Really?

00:02:41.241 --> 00:02:43.050
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.390
Then, Hoshina-kun,
could you be my assistant today?

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.310
Yes.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.820
I'll be counting on you.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.480
Also,

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.870
regarding the question you asked yesterday,

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.420
about the feeling of 'liking this job',

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.570
I thought about it myself.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.410
I think

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.560
I truly came to love this job

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.100
after gaining the trust of customers.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.190
- Trust?
- Yes.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.660
So, Hoshina-kun, I hope you can
experience that feeling for yourself.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.320
I believe you'll surely find
the value of this work through it.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.650
Okay, I'll do my best.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.169
Then let's confirm
today's schedule.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.840
Okay.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.890
Hoshina-kun's training policy,

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.440
though not fully decided yet,

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.430
for now, anyway...

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.219
Let's focus on practicing
makeup trials first.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.830
Besides makeup removal, it
seems they also want makeup trials...

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.380
Sorry to ask you to
stay for extra practice.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.109
Then let's start the makeup trial practice.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.110
Okay.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.700
Please take care of me.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.130
- I'll put the makeup cape on you first.
- Okay.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:51.530
Excuse me.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.080
Then I'll remove your makeup.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:06.780
Huh?

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.050
Excuse me.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.290
What's going on?

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.630
His movements are very smooth.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.200
Done.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.240
Um...

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.190
Hoshina-kun, your
movements are very precise.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.296
Completely different from when
you served a customer last time.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.480
- Really?
- Yes.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.420
I don't see any problems.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.420
Was it just a bad day on your first day?

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.820
No, um...

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.300
I'm more relaxed when
I'm with people I know.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.120
Then it's my turn next.

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.370
Okay.

00:05:06.233 --> 00:05:07.863
Then... I'll put the makeup cape on you.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:14.770
Excuse me.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.920
I'm sorry.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.090
Then... I'll remove your makeup.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:33.700
The mirror...

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.260
What's wrong with him?

00:05:37.366 --> 00:05:39.406
Hmm... yeah...

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.800
- Hoshina-kun, wait a moment.
- Yes...

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.060
You just did a total 180.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.220
What's wrong?

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:48.890
I'm sorry.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.860
Um... I'm too nervous.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.760
Is it because of me?

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.210
No, it's not like that.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.690
Um... Aizawa-san is very cool and aloof.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.080
And has a strong aura...

00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:04.510
So I don't have an aura?

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.610
That's not what I meant, um...

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:07.780
I'm sorry, uh...

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.970
You've changed too much.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.750
He's already learned the basic techniques.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.610
- I'm sorry.
- This is truly a psychological issue.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.450
What about me makes you nervous?

00:06:17.896 --> 00:06:20.076
Aizawa-san, don't you realize it yourself?

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.150
- What do you mean?
- I'm sorry, that's not what I meant...

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.650
He can only overcome
nervousness by gaining experience.

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.259
And that's precisely what Hoshina-kun lacks...
- Because both of you have an aura.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.920
- Calm and cute.
- Thank you...

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:36.980
I see.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.170
That's quite tricky then.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.810
Yeah, I originally
wanted to solve it myself.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.200
I just wanted to organize my thoughts,
and before I knew it...

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.220
I don't mind at all.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:49.890
However,

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.439
Natsume-san, that rookie
isn't clinging to you, is he?

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.690
Of course not.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.210
That's good.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.580
Anyway, his performance is so unstable.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.590
We can't easily let
him work at the counter.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.880
I think I can kind of understand why he's
always been assigned to back-office work.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.759
After all, if you only consider
sales and turnover rate,

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.210
his efficiency is too low.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.140
I think Hoshina-kun lacks
successful experiences.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.620
If he gains more practical experience

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.370
and converts it into confidence...

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:21.770
Speaking of which, Natsume-san,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.660
aren't you meddling a bit too much?

00:07:25.145 --> 00:07:25.485
Huh?

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:26.760
When I was a rookie,

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.610
I also found that annoying.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.080
Huh?

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.730
Why are you always like that?

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:37.340
Do you hate this job?

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.130
No, I don't hate it.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.696
I just don't have any particular
strong feelings about it.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.880
A typical rookie would be
intimidated and shrink back.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.830
Not to mention if he's already troubled.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.070
It's because it's me

00:07:47.071 --> 00:07:48.406
that I dare to complain to Natsume-san.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:49.020
Just because it's me...

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:49.880
That sounds a bit irritating.

00:07:49.881 --> 00:07:52.860
Not everyone can keep up with
your enthusiasm, Natsume-san.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.239
You probably said something like,
'You can tell me anything.'

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.496
You put pressure on him, didn't you?

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.110
How did you know...?

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.399
You look like you love your
job so much, shining brightly.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.630
And your aura is strong.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.230
Plus, you're very responsible
and tend to overthink things.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.776
I think instead of teaching him
step-by-step from beginning to end,

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.000
it might be better to let
him think for himself, right?

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.660
Meddling too much can
actually be counterproductive.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.660
Hmm.

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.240
Natsume-san, this salad
you made is delicious.

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:26.940
That's good.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.390
Hey! I finally came to you for advice.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.690
Sorry, I just love to meddle.

00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:41.180
What are you laughing at...?

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:45.810
However,

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:47.650
You might be right.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.330
I might really be too meddlesome.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:53.740
I need to change that.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:54.980
This habit of mine.

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:00.860
Thank you for listening to me.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.590
I really like it.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.450
Your meddlesome side, Natsume-san.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.100
You're so annoying.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.630
Customer service that
earns trust from customers.

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:23.410
And so on.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.610
Anyone can talk the talk.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.720
I want Hoshina-kun

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.740
to experience that
feeling of being trusted.

00:09:33.983 --> 00:09:34.983
But,

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:37.240
that's the most difficult challenge.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:45.710
Are you thinking about something?

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:48.760
Yes.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:49.990
A little.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.769
Until Natsume-san falls asleep,

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:57.930
I'll stay with you like this.

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:11.770
Oh dear.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:13.990
I talked too much by accident, I'm sorry.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:16.030
Because I had so much fun talking.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.320
That's wonderful.

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:19.890
Please come again.

00:10:19.891 --> 00:10:20.891
We look forward to your visit.

00:10:20.915 --> 00:10:22.077
You've been a great help.

00:10:22.366 --> 00:10:23.366
I'll come again.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.330
Thank you for your patronage.

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.100
With support, it's no problem.

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:36.880
Is it because I'm here...?

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:40.849
- Oh, the phone.
- I'll get it.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:42.370
Could you tidy up the counter?

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:43.660
Okay.

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:47.080
Thank you for calling.

00:10:47.081 --> 00:10:49.069
This is Romy Felique,
Shinonome Yurakucho branch.

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:50.070
This is Mamiya...

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.440
Ah, Tanouchi-san.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.480
Good work.

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:56.660
- Ah, yes.
- Welcome.

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:58.150
Welcome.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.210
Yes, no, no, it's fine.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:03.510
Okay.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:05.860
- Um...
- Yes.

00:11:06.016 --> 00:11:08.146
- I'd like to try this.
- Okay...

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.880
I'll be right there after I finish this
call. Please take care of it until then.

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:16.630
Yes, no, no.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.300
I apologize for the wait.

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:22.230
- You'd like to try this eyeshadow?
- Yes.

00:11:23.073 --> 00:11:24.523
Okay, I'll take you there.

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:25.840
This way, please.

00:11:28.263 --> 00:11:29.753
Yes, I think so too.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.090
Right, so let's just watch quietly here.

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:47.649
- I'll remove your eye makeup first.
- Please do.

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:48.650
Okay.

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:56.790
Excuse me.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.630
I don't have much time.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.150
Could you please hurry?

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:02.580
Ah... I'm sorry.

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.350
I'm truly sorry.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.009
Tanouchi-san, I'm sorry.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.010
I'm serving a customer right now.

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:11.010
I'll call you back later.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.180
Excuse me.

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:15.630
I am truly very sorry.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Excuse me.

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:18.930
I'm in a hurry, can someone else help me?

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.640
Okay, I understand.

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:30.240
I'll take care of your eyes first.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.220
And what about the eyeshadow?

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.280
Let's talk about it next time.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:37.620
Okay, I understand.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.260
I am truly very sorry about today.

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:44.700
Thank you for your patronage.

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:54.640
Mamiya-san.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.380
I'm truly sorry.

00:12:58.270 --> 00:12:59.970
You rarely entrust a customer to me...

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:02.250
I should be the one apologizing.

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:03.850
That was my fault just now.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.240
No, that's not true.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.400
I messed up because I rushed.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:13.560
Maybe I'm just not cut out to be a BA.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.560
Huh?

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:19.450
Ah, I'll go get the
refill for the pre-serum.

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:21.940
I'm truly very sorry.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:26.630
That's not it.

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:29.680
I didn't want him to
say something like that.

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.300
I originally wanted
Hoshina-kun to build confidence,

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.440
but instead, I discouraged him.

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:40.670
What should I do...?

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:50.180
Huh?

00:13:50.775 --> 00:13:53.840
Sahashi-kun, you're not in charge
of tomorrow's makeup event, are you?

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.069
They suddenly needed an extra person,

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:57.130
so I volunteered.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.990
Sahashi-kun, you really work hard.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:01.786
You don't have to push yourself so hard.

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:03.370
It's okay to slow down a bit, isn't it?

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:06.190
No.

00:14:06.553 --> 00:14:07.553
I can't take it slow.

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:19.350
Then I'll leave the store to you tomorrow.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:22.860
You don't have to tell me that.

00:14:26.683 --> 00:14:28.403
Thinking I had to solve it quickly,

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.000
I might have been too impatient.

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:31.590
I should have...

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:34.250
thought more about a method
that suits Hoshina-kun better.

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:37.770
I'll discuss it with Toma
when he gets back.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:42.960
You're back.

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:44.510
I'm back.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:45.240
Huh?

00:14:45.241 --> 00:14:46.456
Are you going on a business trip?

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.909
The Umeda store has a makeup
event with a makeup artist.

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:49.950
I'm going to support them.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.299
I'm taking the first train tomorrow,

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.300
so I'll leave early.

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:55.850
Then go take a bath
quickly and get some sleep.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.520
Let's take a bath together then.

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:02.350
I already took one.

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:05.110
Oh, what a shame.

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:06.870
Then I'll go wash myself.

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:11.340
Toma...

00:15:11.954 --> 00:15:13.530
He seems really tired.

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:17.480
It seems Hoshina-kun's matter...

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:19.830
I'll still have to solve it
with my own strength.

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:28.690
Loser mentality?

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.320
Yes.

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.580
I'm already used to being a loser.

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.020
During my student days...

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:38.820
I played basketball all the time,

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:41.370
but I was always a substitute player.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:47.330
What I want to do...
and what I can do are two different things.

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.460
That's what I realized.

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:52.930
So...

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:55.210
I was very troubled when looking for a job.

00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:58.650
I also wanted to...

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:01.180
achieve something at least once.

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:03.870
But...

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:07.470
if I went for a job that
everyone was scrambling for,

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:11.100
would I just get lost in the crowd again?

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.190
That's when I learned about Sahashi-san.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.190
I thought, maybe...

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.520
if I immerse myself in such an environment,

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:25.180
I could change myself.

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:30.770
It turns out I was too naive.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.780
This job can't be done
with half-hearted motivation.

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:46.720
When things weren't going
well at the Ikebukuro store,

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.050
I also thought about giving up.

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:57.980
But if I give up here...

00:16:58.330 --> 00:16:59.940
I feel like I'd truly lose.

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:05.490
Although I'm not very
good at expressing myself.

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.060
I see.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.740
Hoshina-kun became a BA

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:14.970
to overcome himself, didn't he?

00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:20.260
Hoshina-kun, you...

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:22.690
have very keen observation skills.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.520
Huh?

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:27.630
You immediately notice
what needs to be restocked,

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:30.310
you quickly remember inventory locations,

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:33.660
and you're diligent in cleaning.

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:36.570
You keep the entire counter very clean.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.280
That's because...

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:42.810
I've always only been able
to do those kinds of things.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.680
Being able to notice areas where 'if
no one does it, there will be a problem'

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:51.190
I think that's Hoshina-kun's talent.

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:57.340
If you add the ability
to gain customer trust,

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:00.990
you'll surely become an even better BA.

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:03.910
So, Hoshina-kun...

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:08.350
how about trusting the person you
were when you chose to become a BA,

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:10.640
and trying a little harder, okay?

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:18.470
Tsukimura-san, thank
you very much for today.

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.070
No, no, I'm happy to be asked by you.

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:25.250
Then, Hoshina-kun will serve you next.

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:28.260
He's the BA who wants to practice, right?

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:30.310
Mamiya-san already told me.

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:32.270
Yes, I am Hoshina.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.230
Nice to meet you.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:35.540
Nice to meet you too.

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:39.180
- Then I'll put the makeup cape on you.
- Okay.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:43.880
What I can do...

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:47.070
is to prepare an opportunity
for him to gain experience.

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:49.450
The rest...

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:51.729
is just to trust Hoshina-kun
and the customer,

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:52.970
and watch over them.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:55.590
Excuse me.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:02.640
Excuse me.

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:09.490
Is it okay?

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:11.306
That's your regular customer, isn't it?

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:13.010
Are you really okay entrusting her to him?

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.220
If anything goes wrong,

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:17.300
I'll take full responsibility.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:25.129
Thank you very much for
taking the time to come today.

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:26.130
Not at all.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:27.560
I'll be cheering for you.

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:29.780
Thank you.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:32.140
Thank you for your patronage.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.790
Then I'll go check the inventory.

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:42.650
- Okay.
- Mm.

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:58.440
How was it?

00:19:58.803 --> 00:20:00.163
After actually serving a customer,

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:04.640
I still get nervous, but...

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.410
Mamiya-san's customers are all very kind.

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:10.710
Speaking of which...

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:12.460
Mamiya-san is really amazing.

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:19.600
Every customer was willing to practice
with me because Mamiya-san asked them.

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:24.560
So this is what 'being trusted' feels like.

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:26.950
Indeed...

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:29.859
Mamiya, who always puts customers first,

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.350
has gone this far for you.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.580
You should cherish this
opportunity you've gained.

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:36.770
Yes.

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:46.550
Welcome.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.050
Ah... um...

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:50.530
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:52.930
I saw online that...

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:54.750
Yes.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.249
I'd like to try this kind of makeup...

00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:59.250
Okay.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.020
However...

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.120
This is my first time
coming to a place like this.

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:10.690
It's natural to be nervous
when coming to a place like this.

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:11.950
If you don't mind,

00:21:11.951 --> 00:21:13.716
would you like to try
a few different styles?

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:14.740
May I?

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:17.530
Of course, please come this way.

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:18.830
Okay.

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:23.100
- Please place your belongings here.
- Thank you.

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.230
- Please sit down.
- Okay.

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.630
- May I confirm the photo again?
- Yes.

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:34.950
Excuse me.

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:03.950
Here you go.

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:12.320
So I can also look like this...

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:16.590
It suits you very well, Ms. Okada.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.370
Thank you.

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:30.670
Thank you.

00:22:32.168 --> 00:22:34.250
Hoshina-san... right?

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:35.470
Yes.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.720
When I make my next appointment,

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:41.230
can I request you to serve me?

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.330
Yes, of course.

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:47.500
That's great.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:49.910
I'll definitely come again.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.370
Thank you.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.490
Thank you.

00:23:17.112 --> 00:23:18.862
Hoshina-kun, you worked very hard today.

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:21.020
Yes, thank you.

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:23.250
Thanks to Mamiya-san,

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:25.380
I had my first customer.

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:30.700
That means you've
gained the customer's trust.

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:32.420
That's wonderful.

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:33.590
Yes.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:35.880
Um...

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:40.340
I still, after all,

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:43.340
want to become a BA like Mamiya-san.

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:48.170
Thank you.

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:51.910
There's an event
tomorrow, it'll be even busier.

00:23:52.936 --> 00:23:54.806
Hoshina-kun will also be part of the team.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.360
Yes.

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:58.060
Let's do our best together.

00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:59.250
I'll do my best.

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:01.752
That's great.

00:24:03.123 --> 00:24:05.934
Indeed, the solid feeling of
being trusted by a customer

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:08.670
gives more confidence than anything else.

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.760
(Sahashi Toma: I've
arrived at Tokyo Station.)

00:24:17.083 --> 00:24:18.083
Hoshina-kun, sorry.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.700
- I have to go now.
- Okay.

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:21.910
Good work.

00:24:21.935 --> 00:24:22.935
You really worked hard.

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:24.980
You worked hard.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.400
I don't know why, but I
really want to see Toma.

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:30.950
When something good happens,

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:33.210
the first person I want to see is...

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:34.690
Toma.

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:42.290
Did something good happen?

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:44.070
Yeah, today Hoshina-kun, he...

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:44.690
Ah, wait a minute.

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:45.940
Huh?

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:47.356
I guess... I still don't
really want to hear about it.

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:48.780
Things about other guys, and so on.

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:50.520
Do you want to hear it or not?

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:52.720
Ah.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
So, what happened?

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:55.696
I'm so tired, and Hoshina-kun, he...

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.040
That's why I said, wait a minute.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.179
(Next Episode) After all, I was the one who
brought up Sahashi-kun to Emma.

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:18.140
I feel like I have a responsibility.

00:25:18.141 --> 00:25:21.629
We just put the choices in front of him.
He's the one who truly made the decision.

00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:23.688
I heard Risako specifically
asked for Natsume-san.

00:25:23.713 --> 00:25:24.102
Huh?

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.200
Is something wrong?

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.040
This is definitely not a manager's job.
