00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.560
Have some.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.760
These are all your favorite dishes.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.160
Try this.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.160
Can you stop it now?

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.760
Ouch!

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.080
Cut the act.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.600
Can you fucking leave me alone?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.120
Why the hell are you doing this?

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.120
Between us...

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.720
It's over.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.480
Over?

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.401
Yeah!

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.440
It's over!

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:19.480
♫What is left are shadows of ourselves
standing in its place♫

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.440
♫And the scars of our pain♫

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.080
♫That will never fade away♫

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.280
♫What is left is the gaping wound of the past♫

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:40.640
♫Imprisoned by the love
neither of us could never grasp♫

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.880
♫If we could turn back time,♫

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.800
♫I wonder if we'd hold each other again♫

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.320
We have nothing left, honey.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.480
Kelvin...

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.880
Kelvin...

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.120
Kelvin...

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.360
Kelvin...

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.360
Mom...

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.560
What's wrong?

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.440
Bad dream?

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.800
I nodded off.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.760
Any news from the investment firms?

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.440
Not yet.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.160
These investment firms

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.680
are highly competitive.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.000
And the closer you get,

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.800
the more problems come up.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.360
Are you okay, though?

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.800
Let me take a 15-minute nap.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.520
You can wake me up after that.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.520
Please head to Kelvin's place now.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.360
Hello, Mr. Vier.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.360
- You're Chao, right?
- Yes, sir.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.240
I'm Mr. Kelvin's assistant.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.400
Right this way, sir.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.632
You can stay here.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.880
Take a look at this.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.600
An investment agreement?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.720
Yeah.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.480
I thought you said VPG Group
would never invest in my business.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.080
This is my money.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.160
Now sign it.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.662
Why are you doing this?

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.640
You think I'm pathetic?

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.600
I'm doing this

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.200
because I agree with you

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.680
and I want to take a chance on you.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.760
Besides,

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.560
I trust that...

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.920
you won't let me down.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.880
What?

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.480
This is your hotel business.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.120
How can you just give me
half of the shares?

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.800
We'll call it

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.440
"V&V."

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.120
What do you think?

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.320
Vier...

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.800
I give you my word.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.520
I may have nothing right now,

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.360
but in the future,

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.400
when our hotel grows,

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.840
I'll give you half of the shares.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.240
And no matter what happens,

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.280
I promise I'll face it with you.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.600
This is a business agreement,

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.920
not a marriage certificate.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.000
No need to be that dramatic.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.000
To me, this matters
even more than marriage.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:48.880
Okay.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.560
I'll sign, then.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:58.940
So,

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.440
we're partners now.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.360
Yes, boss.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.480
I thought you weren't into fishing.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.880
I just wanna try something new.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.440
That 'something new' you talked about...

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.407
Is it fishing...

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.080
or the person you fished with last time?

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.120
Fishing turned you two into partners, huh?

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.600
Where is he, though?

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.920
Why didn't you invite him, too?

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.760
He's got work to do, man.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.800
You can't expect him
to be with me all the time.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.240
You're honestly too kind.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.373
When you trust someone,

00:07:58.413 --> 00:08:00.712
you trust them completely.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.120
I think you should be more careful

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.160
so you don't get taken advantage of again.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.000
I've still got you.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.760
You've got my back.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.680
But I can't be with you forever, you know.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.720
My grandma's sick.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
She's been sick for a long time.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.040
What?

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.720
Why didn't you tell me?

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.600
You seemed busy,

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.640
so I didn't want to.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.400
I've already talked to her, though.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.240
I told her
I needed to finish things up here first.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.000
Once I'm done,
I'll go back to Malaysia.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.320
Thanks a lot, Lit.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.680
For all these years,

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.400
without you,

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.520
- I'd have been in real trouble.
- Whoa, what the hell?!

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.560
Jeez, that's cringe!

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.920
Stop it. Enough.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.360
I'm not buying it.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.160
Let's see how fun fishing is.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:50.800
How do I do this?

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.640
Just cast the line anywhere.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.960
Anywhere?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.120
- Just cast the line.
- Cast...

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.240
Hey, watch my head!

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.120
Yeah, I'll cast it now.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:00.760
Whoa...

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.400
It's not that hard, gosh.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.040
Hello, sir.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:10.960
How's everything going?

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.200
I've already talked to them,

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.600
but they insist
that they won't move out.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:14.940
It's okay.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.060
I'll talk to them again.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.240
We need to figure this out together.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.240
Yes, sir.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.120
[A gift from my buddy Lalit, lol]

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.700
Lalit again?

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.160
Are you free tomorrow?

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.720
So,

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.400
where are you taking me to?

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.320
If this is a date,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.240
just say so.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.280
I'll show you
what all the effort has led to.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.080
I'm sorry.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.362
I should've told you

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.243
that we were coming
to this construction site.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.760
I shouldn't have expected
anything romantic from you.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:41.960
Anyway,

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.520
as the boss,
you need to know everything.

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:49.620
Fine.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.680
Look. Right there.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:56.400
Once we finish painting,
it'll be pretty much done.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:58.792
You bastards!

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:00.520
Hey!

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.560
Go the fuck away!

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.040
This is my house. It's my place!

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:08.960
Get him out of here.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.560
You're planning
to profit off this place, huh?

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.360
- Hey, let go of me!
- Are you okay?

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.080
- Let me go. It hurts.
- I should be the one asking.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:16.880
Fuck you!

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:17.800
Get out!

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.160
His name is Pong. He's a local.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.720
He's caused trouble several times before.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:22.880
It's nothing.

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.280
I can take care of it.

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.760
Please take Vier back.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.600
Some locals still refuse to relocate,

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.880
but I don't know
how he managed to get in here.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.560
That's a lot.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.080
Yeah, a lot.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.400
This will get us through another day.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.200
Why the hell are you here?!

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.280
You can't live here forever.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.760
This land belongs to the hotel.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.200
Please move out as soon as possible.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.160
You're threatening me now?!

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.200
You're the reason I lost my home!

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.520
I have nowhere to go!

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.120
Get out!

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.760
You're not welcome here!

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:14.920
Do you hear me?!

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.520
Go away!

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.240
The demolition papers are ready,

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.240
and the team is in position.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.640
Proceed as planned.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.600
Are we really going to use force?

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:54.720
What about the locals?

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.080
Not our problem.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.040
If they want to stay, let them.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:03.960
From now on,

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.240
whatever happens,

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.720
they must live with the consequences.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:11.800
Yes, sir.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.240
Mr. Kelvin,

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.320
Mr. Vier is now at one of the locals' houses.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.280
Wait. Don't do anything yet.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.720
That looks nice.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.200
Oh, Kelvin?

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:37.880
There you are.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.080
Why the hell are you here?

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:41.260
Calm down.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.360
I already told you.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:47.240
Our hotel is not taking anything away
from the community.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.381
What we're doing

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:53.760
is giving the world a chance
to see your culture and skills.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.200
And one day, these crafts

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.320
will become souvenirs,

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.360
creating income
that flows back to the community.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.560
That's just
what you rich people always say.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.280
In the end,
it's always us who are gonna lose.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.200
I understand,

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.960
but think about it from another angle.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.120
We want this community
to be the soul of the hotel,

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.960
a place where the world
can come to learn who we are.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.259
Right?

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.200
Uh...

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:31.880
He's right.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.480
We have to rely on you,

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.360
the sea,

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.880
and local wisdom
that's been passed down for generations.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.320
The income from tourists

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.005
will be distributed to the community

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.400
through souvenirs

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.480
and employment.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.880
So everyone gains from this,

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.160
not just us.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.840
We won't tear anything down.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:06.640
Is that alright?

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:08.360
Are you telling the truth?

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.880
That means we don't need to
move out anymore, right?

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.520
Stay here for a moment.

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.000
I'll let my parents and the others know.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.944
Let tourists experience
the community's way of life

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
and culture.

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.040
That way,

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.040
the locals won't have to move out.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.680
The hotel will also gain
a unique identity.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.360
That's right.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.560
And no one has to lose anything.

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.880
It's a win-win for both sides.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.240
Didn't you say it yourself

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:53.800
that the boss
needs to understand everything,

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.520
both the public side
and what happens behind the scenes?

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.480
I'm just doing my job.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:01.280
Yeah.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:05.800
Sir!

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:07.800
Sir...

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.400
I've already told the others.

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.520
Some of them agreed.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:15.680
A lot of them, actually.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.520
But some...

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.000
are still unsure
if you'll keep your promise.

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.200
So they asked me

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.240
to invite you two to dinner,

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.720
so they can see for themselves

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.520
whether your intentions are genuine.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.280
But...

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.080
what if we eat too much?

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:39.800
Will they be okay?

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:41.880
Just give it a try.

I want to apologize

for causing you trouble earlier.

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:27.680
Someone told me that
if I exaggerated things,

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.840
you wouldn't kick us out

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:31.920
and your project wouldn't be completed.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.680

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.040
Who are they?

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.520
Just a nice guy
from a nearby community.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.160
He was well dressed,
and his car was fancy.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:46.600
Just forget it.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.560

- Right.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.280
It's okay.

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:57.320
I'll be back.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.680
You think the person who told him...

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.440
is really a nice guy?

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:07.880
I'll have someone look into it.

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:10.540
If they really meant well,

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:11.900
then that's good.

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.020
But if they didn't,

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:17.640
this may be just the beginning.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.320
We just have to be...

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.880
more careful after this,

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.760
so we don't have to
go through it again.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.360

Nothing.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:03.880
Yeah.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:06.120
I'm nothing but a log!

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:08.840
I'm an idiot for helping you!

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:10.520
You're always sarcastic,

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.720
and you deal with problems
by sleeping with people.

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:14.840
From now on,

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.280
I won't help you anymore.

Do whatever you want.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:30.960
You like me, don't you?

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.600
You want to sleep with me, don't you?

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.520
Yeah, I do.

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.360
I freaking do.

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:56.240
But if this is just a one-night stand,

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:57.620
I'm out.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.760
I don't want to give you my heart

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.960
just to end up with nothing.

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.800
I'm sorry.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000
I...

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:31.800
I'm serious about you.

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:37.720
And I'll prove it to you.

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:19.580
Mr. Kelvin,

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.720
Mr. Vier is waiting inside.

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:24.100
Thank you.

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:30.560
You're so early.

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:34.520
When I said I was serious,

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:37.400
I meant it
about both my work and my life.

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:43.600
Also,

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.280
I've already found

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:47.720
the mastermind who incited the locals.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:49.640
You've found him, too?

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.280
He thought he was clever,

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:55.000
but he exposed himself completely.

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.880
I'll make him pay.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.358
How will you do that?

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:03.480
Just like he did to us.

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:06.680

and checking out our future hotel.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:21.700
Is my idea good?

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:23.840
Give me a compliment.

[Locals Protest Demolition Planned
for King Group's New Hotel]

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.280
What the fuck is this?

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:32.960
You said someone already dealt with it.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.800
The locals said someone told them
to exaggerate things

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.680
so we wouldn't kick them out.

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.920
Son of a bitch!

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.120
Mr. Ken,

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:47.400
I feel like they already know.

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:49.280
Should we pause
what we're doing for now?

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.240
If this gets any messier,

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:54.200
I'm worried it could affect
the company's reputation.

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:55.520
If they know, so what?

00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.200
You think they can go up
against King Group?

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.240
Pathetic!

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.240
I've got more than enough ways
to handle them.

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.560
Have you seen the news about them?

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.200
They've messed with the wrong person.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.240
This is Vier, you know.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.200
Aren't you worried
they'll come after us again?

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.400
Why would I?

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.040
If they play dirty,
I'll do it right back.

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:36.560
I won't let anyone

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:39.840

Am I smart?

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:48.920
Do I get a reward for that?

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.600
What do you want?

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:22.800
I just wanna watch a movie.

I have something for you.

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:54.900
What is it?

00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:57.720
Not telling you.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:03.160
Thanks.

00:35:08.839 --> 00:35:11.560
Hi, hi. Who's there?

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:14.440
It's your boy, Lalit.

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:16.560
Yeah, what is it?

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.075
Yeah, okay.

No.

Let's do this, then.

We'll just throw a small party
in my room.

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.600
I'll order some food
so you can focus on your work.

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:03.560
And you won't have to walk a lot.

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:04.800
Alright?

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:06.680

He's so hard-working.

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:45.800
and a man who loves him.

Lalit,

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.560
didn't you say you needed some rest?

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:17.720
Oh...

Okay.

Well,

I'm confused about
this company's financial performance.

00:38:58.020 --> 00:38:59.880
It doesn't really align
with the stock's trend.

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.960
That's not the right way

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:11.240
to analyze a financial report.

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:26.520
Stop staring at your teacher.

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:28.700
I know I'm hot.

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:33.680
You'll end up getting fooled
by financial reports.

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:36.440
I'm sorry.

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:39.640
I won't mess up again.

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.040
And if I do,

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.680
feel free to lecture me.

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:46.660
I can be scary sometimes.

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:48.680
You sure you can take it?

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:00.520
Hey.

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:03.000
You guys forgot
I'm sitting here, or what?

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:04.220
Show some damn respect.

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:05.920
I know you're there,

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:07.520
and I don't care.

00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:09.560
If you don't wanna see this, get out.

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.640
Whoa, fine.

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.280
If you say that, I'll leave.

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:15.800
Staying here will just make me...

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:23.680
Can you not lecture me

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.760
but punish me instead?

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:28.600
Sure thing.

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:44.240
- Leave it to me.
- Oh...

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:52.440

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.360
I told you I'd leave,

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.720
but I only went to get you some food.

00:40:59.080 --> 00:40:59.800
Look.

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:00.760

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.920
You know exactly what I want.

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:13.640
Thanks.

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.160
- Now leave.
- What do you mean?

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.000
I'm hungry.

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:18.320
And one of my legs isn't even working.

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:19.800
What kind of person are you?

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:21.400
Do you even have a heart?

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:41.440
You really like me, right?

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:50.920
Answer me.

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:55.000
Yeah.

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:01.920
Then, from now on,

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:03.680
do not flirt with anyone.

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.224
I hate it.

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:08.360
And from this moment on,

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:11.760
there should be
no one in your eyes but me.

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:14.560
Why?

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:16.640
Are you jealous?

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:21.360
So what?

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:28.360
I like it.

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.220
You done?

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:04.080
Yes.

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:05.200
Have a seat.

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:09.360
I was gonna give you this yesterday,

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.240
but I didn't.

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:13.000
Open it...

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:14.680
so we can see it together.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:15.880
Have a look.

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:25.000
What do you think?

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.280
Matching pajamas.

00:43:27.717 --> 00:43:31.000
Wearing good pajamas
will help you sleep better.

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:33.240
Thank you.

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:43.680
Is this belt included in the set?

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:51.320
Is this a prank?

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:53.680
Well...

00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:56.600
It's not just about
a good night's sleep.

00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:59.760
Small pleasures

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:03.280
are important, too.

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:04.800
Pleasures?

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:06.520
Or are you just being horny?

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:10.200
Then tell me.

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:14.920
Can you satisfy that side of me?

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:19.720
No.

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:26.280
I'll take just this.

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:53.240
Long time no see, Kelvin.

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:56.720
How have you been?

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:00.120
You're about to fly off
on your own, huh?

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:03.280
Craving independence already?

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:13.880
Let me tell you something.

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:16.320
Dressing yourself up nicely...

00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:19.680
doesn't turn a crow

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:22.040
into a swan.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.240
Crow or swan,

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:28.800
they both can fly.

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:31.190
But some people?

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:33.560
Even with wings of gold,

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:36.960
they still fly low, crawling beneath others.

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.000
Who are you talking about, bitch?!

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:44.120
It's been a while, Ms. Lin.

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:47.560
I heard that V&V HOTEL
is opening tomorrow.

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:49.200
Congratulations, Mr. Kelvin.

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:50.360
Thank you.

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:53.400
If you're available,
please consider coming.

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:07.800
Take care of it for me.

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:09.720
Yeah.

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:14.600
That opening event of yours...

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:18.131
I'll make sure
not a single person shows up.

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:23.800
Wait,

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.600
why is no one here?

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:28.200
What?

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.880
Didn't you send them the invitations?

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:34.020
I guess so.

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:37.480
Not a single person came.

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:41.660
Turns out...

00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:43.720
it's you.

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.440
When it comes to hotels,

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:50.960
King Group leads the industry

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:54.520
and sets a standard

00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:58.680
other hotels can't reach.

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:02.560
Do you think your pathetic little hotel
stands a chance?

00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:09.920
Why the fuck are you laughing?

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:10.960
'Cause you're a fucking asshole.

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:12.960
Kelvin,

00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:14.720
is it almost time?

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:21.080
In three, two, one...

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:29.000
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.520
Hi, thank you for coming.

00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:32.003
- Thank you. Hi.
- Hello.

00:47:32.043 --> 00:47:33.320
- Hi. Welcome.
- Welcome.

00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:34.480
Please watch your step.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:35.840
The timing is just perfect.

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:37.160
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:38.434
- Hi.
- Hello.

00:47:38.474 --> 00:47:40.040
- Hi. Thanks for coming.
- Thank you.

00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:41.280
- Thank you.
- Oh, Mr. Ken.

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:43.640
- Hi, please come down here.
- Hi.

00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:48.477
Let's welcome the guests.

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:53.800
This can't be true.

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:57.680
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome

00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:00.520
to the grand opening of V&V Group.

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:08.160
I'd like to thank everyone who was invited,

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:10.560
as well as those who came uninvited.

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:12.920
Anyway,

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:17.520
every one of you will witness
the launch of V&V today.

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:19.080
Thank you very much.

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:21.920
Yay!

00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:25.400
- Cheers to...
- V&V.

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:27.280
- Cheers to...
- V&V.

00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:29.840
Thank you.

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:35.480
What are you doing here?

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:39.568
Want a drink?

00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:47.160
Vier asked me to tell you that

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:50.320
everyone...

00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:53.040
has known all along
what you were trying to pull.

00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:56.000
So...

00:48:57.700 --> 00:48:59.040
from now on,

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.680
please focus on your own business

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:05.800
and stop embarrassing yourself.

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:08.680
Because if it happens again,

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:13.280
I don't think
everyone will let it slide so easily.

00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:16.840
Please take a good look at yourself.

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:21.640
Still want this?

00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:47.240
You've already shown me everything.

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:48.920
Where else are you taking me?

00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:51.600
I'm just so happy.

00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:53.720
I never thought this day would come.

00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:55.400
But...

00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:59.400
there's one more place
you haven't seen yet.

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:36.220
Do you like it?

00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:39.440
Did you...

00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:41.880
prepare all of this yourself?

00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:43.640
Yes.

00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:46.480
Unfortunately,

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:50.120
today could've been a really good day

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:52.320
if Ken hadn't shown up.

00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:55.240
I'm really sorry.

00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:58.280
It's okay.

00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:00.960
After this,

00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:04.520
I don't think
he'll pull any stupid moves again.

00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:31.460
You've seen it now.

00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:50.280
Hold on.

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:53.680
Aren't we gonna move to the bed?

00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:56.940
No.

00:52:57.580 --> 00:52:58.760
This is already perfect.

00:54:23.446 --> 00:54:23.938
No.

00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:25.760
Let me go.

00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:28.240
No, Ken...

00:54:28.326 --> 00:54:29.511
Leave me alone.

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:30.840
No, Ken...

00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:32.240
Please, Ken. I'm begging you.

00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:33.080
- Don't do it.
- Kelvin...

00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:34.400
Please don't.

00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:35.240
Kelvin...

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:36.474
Kelvin...

00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:40.440
A nightmare?

00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:50.740
I'm sorry.

00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:53.240
Did I wake you up?

00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:56.240
It's fine.

00:54:57.940 --> 00:54:59.120
It was just a bad dream.

00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:02.840
Does this happen to you a lot?

00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:08.300
Always.

00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:15.680
Vier...

00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:22.200
Thank you so much.

00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:27.640
Ever since my mom died,

00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:31.560
I can't even remember the last time

00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:33.100
I felt real happiness.

00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:39.000
I'm really grateful to you.

00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:43.280
Lately,

00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:45.720
my life's been full of happiness.

00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:48.440
I have my own hotel now,

00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:52.080
and I have someone who loves me
by my side.

00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:00.800
That's all I need.

00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:04.320
I don't need anyone to congratulate me.

00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:06.380
It's okay.

00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:10.420
As long as you stay right here with me,

00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:12.520
that's more than enough.

00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:18.000
Don't worry.

00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:21.120
No matter what,

00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:24.240
King Group will be yours.

00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:28.720
I'll make them pay...

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:32.520
and make sure everything

00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:35.340
returns to its rightful owner,

00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:39.040
the one it was always meant for.

00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:08.440
[V&V Unveils
an Ultra-Luxury Beachfront Concept]

00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:11.498
So they really
have the nerve to do that.

00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:13.520
Just wait and see.

00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:17.080
I'll drive them
out of this industry for good.

00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:20.400
I heard you already spread the word...

00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:24.720
that any supplier
who wants to work with King Group

00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:26.320
can't have anything to do with V&V.

00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:28.400
Yes, Dad.

00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:30.680
I'm giving them just one year,

00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:32.800
and they'll be finished for sure.

00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:40.040
A large hotel group

00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:42.960
picking on a smaller hotel

00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:45.520
isn't very dignified.

00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:47.440
And it's a waste of time.

00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:56.440
I'm attending Mr. Watt's event
this afternoon

00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:57.800
and heading to the airport after that.

00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:03.080
You should come with me.

00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:13.880
Uncle Watt, good afternoon.

00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:14.800
Oh...

00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:16.120
How are you doing?

00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:17.400
I'm doing great.

00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:19.640
What about your dad? Is he coming, too?

00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:22.400
This is such an important event.

00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:24.920
How can I miss it?

00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:29.320
Good afternoon, Mr. Katha.

00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:30.440
Good afternoon.

00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:32.560
Right, this is Ms. Un,

00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:34.680
our partner.

00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:36.160
Ms. Un, this is Mr. Watt.

00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:39.800
He runs the largest construction company
in Thailand.

00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:43.960
Hi, nice to meet you.

00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:45.400
Nice to meet you, too.

00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:48.040
It's a shame we couldn't work together.

00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:49.680
It is.

00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:53.800
I've heard that King Group

00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:56.240
has been growing really fast.

00:58:56.540 --> 00:58:58.360
You've renovated several sites

00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:01.320
and implemented
smart home systems throughout.

00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:02.847
Well,

00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:06.540
rumors tend to outrun the truth.

00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:12.800
Still, Mr. Watt,
you were almost right this time.

00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:15.800
In my view, real investment

00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:18.840
is about building a solid system
from the very beginning

00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:20.320
to shape the future,

00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:24.320
rather than cleaning up messes afterward.

00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:29.560
Some people, however,

00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:31.840
are so content with their past success

00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:36.200
that they fail to see
how far others have already moved ahead.

00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:38.760
You're right.

00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:41.160
But when it comes to hotels,

00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:43.280
technology...

00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:47.600
isn't what brings guests
through the door.

00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:51.379
What they're really looking for

00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:55.040
is to be treated as someone special.

00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:57.280
And that...

00:59:58.120 --> 00:59:59.600
is something money can't buy.

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.240
But if you have enough money,

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:04.420
you can definitely buy it.

01:00:04.836 --> 01:00:05.500
Hey, Ken.

01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:08.640
What did you just say?

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:18.320
Dad...

01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:21.740
I'll be waiting there.

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:26.040
Please excuse me.

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:27.760
Vier's here now.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:28.880
No problem.

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.560
I'll have to excuse myself now.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:35.480
I'll see you at the airport.

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:36.520
Sure.

01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:51.080
This isn't a kids' game
where money can buy anything, Ken.

01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:55.772
What you did proves you do not understand
this game well enough. Understand?

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:56.800
I'm sorry, Dad.

01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:58.760
I got ahead of myself.

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:04.280
Alright, I need to go to the airport now.

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:07.200
Take good care of the company.

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:08.800
The contract

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:10.760
can wait until I return.

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:12.480
Yes, Dad.

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:21.560
What is it?

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:23.005
Dad,

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:25.095
this is Kelvin,

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:26.700
my business partner.

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:29.240
Good afternoon.

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:32.000
He's also...

01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:33.800
my boyfriend.

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:39.080
Vier's told me a lot about you, Kelvin.

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.260
Oh, right.

01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:44.880
I've gone through your hotel proposal.

01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:47.560
I'd say...

01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:49.600
it's pretty interesting.

01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:54.160
The animal aspect
and that whole community-based idea...

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:56.800
Keep it up.

01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:59.160
Thank you.

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:01.600
By the way,

01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:04.920
Mes is here today.

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:09.720
I heard you want him
as a presenter, right?

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:11.660
Do you want me to speak to him?

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:12.680
Yes, Dad.

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:36.680
I'm actually quite interested
in this project.

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.080
Well, then...

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:42.040
I won't bother you here.

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:43.160
You can talk to him now.

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:44.295
Yes, Dad.

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:46.400
Thank you.

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:51.200
I have to say,

01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:55.720
this project really caught my interest.

01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:00.520
I'll ask my manager
to contact you again later.

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:02.200
Thank you.

01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:13.520
Oh,

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:15.760
Mes?

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:18.000
Oh, Mr. Ken?

01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:20.133
We have to talk, don't we?

01:03:22.571 --> 01:03:23.480
Let's go.

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:24.981
I'll take care of that.

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:35.240
Let's get out of here.

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:37.760
That's it?

01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:39.700
That's it.

01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:42.200
Once the contract is signed,

01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:44.080
he'll talk to me.

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:51.000
Hey,

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:53.520
I thought you said

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:56.600
you were going to be
the brand ambassador for King Group.

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:01.920
I haven't agreed to anything yet.

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:05.780
The host...

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:08.600
introduced his son to me,

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:10.440
so...

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.480
I was just being polite and said hello.

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:18.920
Still,

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:20.760
if their offer is solid enough,

01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:24.600
I might consider working with them.

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:31.760
How about this?

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:34.000
I'll double your remuneration

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:35.838
and appoint you

01:04:35.863 --> 01:04:39.520
as the one and only
global brand ambassador of King Group.

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:42.640
But you'll need to
sign the contract tonight.

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:44.700
Does that work for you?

01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:47.280
For a deal this big,

01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:51.360
can you really make the decision?

01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:55.820
I sure can.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.240
What's the problem?

01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:01.600
I'm telling you...

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.480
My remuneration is pretty high.

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:12.000
It's a pleasure working with you.

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:18.500
Me, too.

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:24.520
Why is Mes' contract that important?

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:27.600
Honestly, a contract
worth less than 200 million

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:29.640
isn't that big a deal.

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:32.949
But...

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:35.960
I went through King Group's
financial statements

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:40.080
and found that
they've been struggling with cash flow lately.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.720
The company could hit a rough patch,

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:47.080
and some big projects...

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:50.280
might have to stop.

01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:56.760
This is my secret bar.

01:05:57.800 --> 01:05:59.640
Even Lalit has never been here.

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:05.520
From now on,

01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:09.080
we're in this fight together.

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:21.320
Even though I want to win

01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:24.040
and get everything that's mine back,

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:27.200
I'm worried about you.

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:30.760
I'm afraid they might come after you.

01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:34.680
Once you're riding the tiger,

01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:37.520
you can't get off.

01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:40.760
Anyway,

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:44.720
from now on, we'll face this together.

01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:53.800
Do you know what you've done?

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:58.120
This contract will drain
all of our company's cash flow!

01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:01.920
Why didn't you ask me first?!

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.440
For now, take some time off work.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:06.720
I'll handle the rest myself.

01:07:07.206 --> 01:07:08.756
- Dad, but...
- And remember,

01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:12.640
cash flow is the lifeblood of a business.

01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:16.120
If cash coming in

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:18.280
can't keep up with what's going out,

01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:20.440
even companies worth billions

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:22.680
can go under in a matter of months.

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:29.080
Businesses fail
because of cash flow problems every year.

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:31.680
Don't you ever forget that.

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:41.520
Good morning, Ms. Lalyn.

01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:44.760
Can you make pour-over coffee?

01:08:45.621 --> 01:08:46.640
Yes, I can.

01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:32.040
Here's your coffee.

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:33.560
Be careful. It's hot.

01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:57.560
Your application says you can cook.

01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:00.520
Let me try your cooking tonight.

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:02.880
Sure.

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:17.520
"Ms. Lalyn only drinks
pour-over filter coffee."

01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:19.920
I see.

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:24.000
"She only eats freshly cooked meals.

01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:26.880
All ingredients must be fresh,
as selected by her."

01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:35.480
"To maintain her image,
grace, and professionalism,

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:38.560
personal hygiene
must be upheld at all times."

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:44.040
Whoa...

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:49.400
A password?

01:11:57.132 --> 01:11:58.061
Not this.

01:12:30.715 --> 01:12:31.723
You little doggie.

01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:05.400
I cooked all of it myself.

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:10.120
Kelvin,

01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:12.240
aren't you sick of this?

01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:15.200
Cut the bullshit.

01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:20.640
If you don't love me, just let me go.

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:24.000
Why are you doing this?

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:25.800
I don't get it.

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:33.880
I'm not putting on an act.

01:13:38.907 --> 01:13:40.267
I'm asking you seriously.

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:43.080
Was I really that wrong...

01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.040
for doing that one thing?

01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:48.440
Is it really unforgivable to you?

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
You promised we'd stay together forever.

01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:06.560
I don't get it.

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:11.200
Why can't you forgive me?

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:13.840
You've got the nerve to ask me that?

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:16.160
Yeah.

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:18.360
'Cause I don't understand.

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:20.462
Do I really have to say it out loud?

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:23.640
I loved you. I did everything for you.

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:24.920
I gave you everything I had.

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:25.960
And you...

01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:28.720
What the fuck did you ever give me?

01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:41.080
I love you, too.

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:45.560
The same way you loved me.

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:48.560
I already gave you my whole life.

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:49.720
You love me?

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:52.680
A love full of lies and bullshit?

01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:57.320
The kind of love where you lied to me?

01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:59.800
You betrayed my trust.

01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:02.640
And if this is the life
you think you gave me,

01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:04.720
I don't want it at all.

01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:08.320
Vier,

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:13.600
you're being irrational right now.

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:18.120
You need to draw a clear line

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:22.920
between business, love,
and personal matters.

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:27.760
You know we're both businesspeople.

01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:30.760
And in the business world,

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:32.640
competition

01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:34.520
and deception are completely normal.

01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:37.320
Everything I did

01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:39.400
was for the sake of both of us.

01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:49.640
You teamed up with W Group

01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:52.960
because you wanted
the technology I developed,

01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:55.320
the one they stole.

01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:57.840
You knew

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.160
that once you sided with them,

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:03.280
you'd get to use it for free
in the future.

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:07.760
Everything you did

01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:10.600
was for yourself.

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:14.520
You used Vivatpattana

01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:16.720
to take over King Group

01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:19.720
and slowly consume W Group.

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:23.680
You planned to betray Vivatpattana
from the start.

01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:26.600
Everything you did

01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:29.220
was only for your own benefit.

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:33.680
You're a fucking liar.

01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:36.560
Full of shit and disgusting.

01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:39.960
Just breathing the same air as you

01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:42.920
makes me sick.

01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:49.700
So you're not...

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:52.000
a gentleman anymore?

01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:58.600
Don't look at me like that.

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:04.960
And don't even try to run

01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:07.200
or do anything stupid.

01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:09.720
Otherwise,

01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:12.520
I swear...

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:17.159
the consequences will haunt you forever.

01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:53.720
♫Countless memories♫

01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:55.280
♫That cut you deep♫

01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:57.440
♫I know there's no way♫

01:17:57.480 --> 01:17:59.080
♫To make things right again,♫

01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:02.840
♫'Cause I once believed
I couldn't love at all♫

01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:06.680
♫Never saw your worth until the fall♫

01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:08.960
♫If I knew how to love you right,♫

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.960
♫I wouldn't live in regret tonight♫

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.800
♫I hope the stars would hear my plea,♫

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:14.840
♫I don't want this pain inside of me♫

01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:16.680
♫I need you♫

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.600
♫Only you♫

♫There's one thing you should know♫

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:26.090
♫I'm sorry I once broke your heart♫

01:18:26.130 --> 01:18:29.840
♫I'm sorry for making you cry♫

01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:41.360
♫I'm sorry I once broke your heart♫

01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:45.100
