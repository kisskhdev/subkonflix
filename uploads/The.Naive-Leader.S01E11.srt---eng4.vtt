WEBVTT

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.350
Move, move, move!

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.000
This is a world of wolves and tigers.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.200
Drifting like duckweed, lives like grass.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.480
In order to survive...

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.920
You must use every ounce of your strength.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.230
Winners become kings, losers become bandits.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.870
Use your strength to prove...

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.480
Which one of you is the king.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.510
A bunch of rabble.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.430
Doing nothing but wicked deeds.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.000
We have no quarrel with you.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.150
Why make us kill each other?

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.640
Because of this.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.640
I won't lay a hand on those two.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:15.630
If you want a fight...

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.430
Have your men fight me instead.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:18.560
You got a death wish?

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.430
Boss Ma, let me handle this.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.520
Why do you always have to jump in?

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.560
Defeat your opponent, and you live.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.590
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.680
Brother, forgive me.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.870
Place your bets! Place your bets!

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.960
Big bowl for the tall one, small bowl for the short one.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.960
You bet on the short one, I'll bet on the tall one.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.430
Big Brother, they're gambling with lives.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.840
Good!

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.280
Get him! Get him!

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:18.960
Yeah!

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.520
Get up! Get up!

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.800
Get up! Get up!

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.120
The tall one won!

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.830
The tall one won!

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.430
The tall one won!

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.190
Wait a minute, wait, wait!

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.190
Boss Ma.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.430
Didn't we just agree...

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.160
That the winner gets to live?

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.040
Why are you feeding him poison?

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.680
Today is a good day.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.680
We return with a full load.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.950
Can you do me a favor?

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.190
Let that bastard who won go.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.870
You think he's pitiful?

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.240
Then you take it.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:02.750
What?

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.750
Why feed it to me?

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.800
What is this stuff? Is it poison?

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.560
What's going on?

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.600
Swap him with the winner.

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.630
I can't take it anymore.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.070
You can.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.040
You are my handpicked Strategist.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.920
I once had a beloved.

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:35.270
We were childhood sweethearts, deeply in love.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:37.830
We pledged our lives to each other.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.750
Suddenly...

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.480
A demon in a military uniform barged in.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.190
To reach an agreement with the bandits...

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.720
The demon sent me up the mountain.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.950
To become the real bandit chief...

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.120
Tiger Ma's Captive Wife.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.950
Who would have thought that demon...

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.310
Would break his word.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.720
He ambushed us when our guard was down.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.510
And killed the real Tiger Ma.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.430
Before he died...

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.600
He entrusted all this to me.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.920
I want revenge.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.040
I want revenge.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.120
I must have revenge.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.360
I am a weak woman, all alone.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.680
Are you willing to help me?

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.360
When it is done...

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.390
I will give myself to you.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.390
Are you willing to become my Deathsworn?

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.950
To die for me?

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.680
Who are you?

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.680
Why should I die for you?

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.070
I am the one you worry about...

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.680
The one haunting your dreams.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.680
Yu Zhen.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.120
Who is Yu Zhen?

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.630
My Missus.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:03.240
You're willing to die for your Missus?

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.920
You love your Missus that much?

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:10.800
I love only her.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.240
I think you want to die.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.680
You and your...

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.160
Childhood sweethearts.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.000
You and your Tiger Ma.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.750
Are just like me and my Yu Zhen.

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:55.120
Did I fall asleep?

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:56.600
You were talking in your sleep.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.790
I dreamt you didn't want to be Tiger Ma.

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.390
But you had no choice but to be Tiger Ma.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.150
You poor thing.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:06.790
I *am* Tiger Ma.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.870
I was born to be Tiger Ma.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.630
No.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.080
I've always felt you're a good person.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.150
You look better with two braids.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:33.720
The same kind of night.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.550
The same place.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.840
The same rain falling.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.240
The things you did to me.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.240
The words you said.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:49.390
They're all right here.

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.630
I'll never forget them as long as I live.

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:55.840
I am your true Deathsworn.

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.270
Having just me as your Deathsworn is enough.

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:06.360
It's enough.

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:09.550
Big Brother.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.120
You need to broaden your horizons.

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:16.120
My sister isn't the only woman here.

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.790
You should take a look around...

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:23.000
...at the other women in the stronghold.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.720
You don't understand.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:33.750
I do understand.

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:40.030
Go away.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.750
Hurry up and go.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:49.720
Come back here.

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:57.600
Big Brother.

00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:59.720
Stop drinking.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:08.120
But in my heart...

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.030
...there is only Tiger Ma.

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:12.550
I'm sorry.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.150
Zhen'er.

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.120
Mom wants to talk something over with you.

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:39.480
I'll find you a new husband.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.720
Are you willing?

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.840
Mom.

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:44.510
Don't bring that up.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:47.510
Let me tell you, what you did that day...

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:49.080
...you did one thing right.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.840
And you did one thing wrong.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.510
The right thing was...

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.150
...not leaving with Fan Bao.

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:56.080
The wrong thing is...

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.150
...you're still thinking about that Sha'er.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.120
He's dead and gone.

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:08.750
Let me tell you the truth.

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:11.390
Sha'er didn't die.

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:14.150
No... no...

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.910
Even if he's not dead, you must treat him as dead.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.270
That day when Fan Bao and Master Wen went back...

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.550
...the elders all found out Fan Sha'er isn't dead.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:25.320
Do you understand?

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:27.390
He's colluding with bandits.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.360
Do you know what a huge crime collusion with bandits is?

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:32.670
Do you think those elders will let him off?

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:34.390
I know him.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.360
No matter how immature he is...

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.630
...he wouldn't collude with bandits.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.670
He did it to protect his brothers.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:43.550
His own great-uncle wanted to bury him alive.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.360
Why are you so silly?

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.550
He is my man, after all.

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:50.200
Now that I know where he is...

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.960
...I definitely have to go find him.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.720
Stop pretending.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.550
You're used to pretending.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.030
I'm not pretending.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.550
Go find him then.

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.630
Can you actually find him?

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:22.360
Is he really like Fan Bao said?

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.840
Opened a hotpot place? Making money?

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.360
What if Fan Bao is lying to you?

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:29.440
Just to comfort you?

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:32.320
That Sha'er left the Fan family.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.960
He is nothing.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:35.910
So what if you find him?

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.030
He has no money.

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:38.840
How will you live?

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:39.720
Mom.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.840
Don't worry about that.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.840
This time,

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.630
whether it's true or false,

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:51.030
dead or alive,

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:53.320
I have to see for myself.

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:56.000
I've made up my mind.

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:58.000
Don't try to stop me.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:58.790
You dare!

00:13:58.840 --> 00:13:59.750
Get back here!

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:06.550
Take care of yourself.

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:09.510
Don't worry about me.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:18.840
Get back here!

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.200
You... You...

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.080
Are you coming back?

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.600
If you don't come back,

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.670
I'll act like I never had you!

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:28.000
Don't ever come back!

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.550
You godforsaken, ungrateful brat!

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:43.790
Division Commander Chen said,

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:45.480
he's seeing no one today.

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:46.480
Brother.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.670
We're from the Huo family.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.120
Division Commander Chen rules this area.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:52.960
Our business,

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.360
he should preside over it.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.440
Quit making a scene!

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.240
I don't care who you are.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.440
Get out!

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.440
What's going on here?

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.080
It's a racket.

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:07.320
Fifth Concubine.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.120
You have to help me this time.

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:22.360
I just want to stay under Division Commander Chen's rule

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.630
and do a little business in peace.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.790
Who knew bandits were so rampant?

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.390
They have no respect for you, Commander.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.360
That your goods were robbed is a minor issue.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:33.960
But they are so arrogant.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.600
It's a slap in Old Chen's face.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.670
Exactly.

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.360
They even dared to rob my goods.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.960
What about the people under your rule?

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.960
Aren't they living in fear every day?

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:45.440
So, regarding bandit suppression,

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.150
it's not just for me.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.000
It's for the people under Division Commander Chen.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.360
We must wipe out these bandits.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.360
Our Old Chen cares about the people.

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.240
I don't need you to remind me.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.440
Yes, yes, yes.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.960
The leader is that guy named Fan.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.270
Named Fan?

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:07.960
That's right.

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.200
The one who opened the hotpot place in town.

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:13.000
Commander Qin even wanted to support him.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.670
Who knew he'd be so ungrateful?

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.120
Under Division Commander Chen's rule,

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.870
he made a fortune.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.870
Then he turned around and colluded with bandits.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.200
How can someone be so unethical?

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:23.790
If we let this slide,

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:25.910
what will happen in the future?

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:26.870
Alright, alright.

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:28.240
I know.

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:29.960
Old Chen,

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:33.000
you can't ignore this.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:40.870
As the old saying goes:

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:44.670
"Good harvest, full bellies."

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:48.550
"Pest plague, starving ghosts."

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.910
Once there's a plague of pests,

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.960
the price of pesticide goes up.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.390
You're a businessman.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.200
Do you think the common folk

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.030
should stock up on pesticide,

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.600
or should I ban merchants from raising prices?

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:05.840
Division Commander Chen,

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.630
where there's demand, there's supply.

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.310
If Division Commander Chen has any concerns,

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:28.240
just say the word.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.960
To be able to solve problems for Division Commander Chen

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:33.400
is an honor for the Huo family.

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:38.070
Young Master Huo is a sincere man.

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:39.750
Then from now on, in our dealings,

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.830
let's lay our cards on the table.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:43.310
Openly.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:45.480
In the future,

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.550
don't go behind my back.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.110
Understood, understood, understood.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.160
I'm planning to run away.

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:13.310
You run, hurry.

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:14.680
Run as far away as possible.

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:18.480
I mean us taking the crew and running together.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:20.160
Why together?

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:21.270
Keep it down.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.240
Brother Fan.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.160
Last night,

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.030
what was the situation?

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:29.070
Why do you care what the situation was?

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:31.920
If we keep staying here,

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:33.680
if we're not killed by Tiger Ma,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.310
we'll die for her sake.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.880
What? What? What are you guys talking about?

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.960
If we don't run,

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:42.590
it's definitely a dead end.

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:44.310
She has her difficulties.

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:46.310
That doesn't mean she can kill people indiscriminately.

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:48.920
No sense of honor.

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:50.030
Exactly, exactly.

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:50.920
Honor?

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:52.480
What kind of honor is that?

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:53.640
Before getting married,

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:55.720
wandering the world, brothers came first.

00:18:56.590 --> 00:19:00.030
Got a woman, and you forgot what brothers are.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:02.550
That's love, you know.

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:03.960
His love has to be understood,

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:05.440
but others' love gets ignored?

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.110
Did I hit a nerve?

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:11.510
Biting the hand that feeds you.

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:13.960
You got special treatment as soon as you arrived.

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:15.510
Ask the brothers,

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.000
who else enjoyed that?

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.510
You're so favored, yet not satisfied.

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:22.640
And you want to undermine her?

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.830
I don't want this kind of favor.

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:29.070
You go, you go.

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:30.200
What you don't want

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:31.830
is what others dream of.

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:36.070
I get it.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.640
Big Brother has fallen for Tiger Ma.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.590
You shut up.

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:42.790
If you want to leave, go by yourself.

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.960
I won't leave.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:45.440
Me not snitching

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.550
is already for the sake of our past brotherhood.

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:07.750
A caravan is passing at the foot of the mountain.

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:08.750
Get ready to move out.

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:10.480
Didn't we just pull a job?

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.790
Why go again?

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.160
That haul could last us a long time.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.480
Sometimes it's not just about being full.

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.550
Strategist, if you don't want to go,

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.880
you can stay home and watch the house.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000
How can I do that?

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:20.960
Everyone goes.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.110
Big Brother.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.200
Think about it.

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:26.590
Don't talk to me.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:27.590
I don't want to listen.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.960
Then everyone goes.

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:38.880
I came too, didn't I?

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:41.110
Against those scumbags,

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:43.400
I don't even need a weapon.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.590
They're here.

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:05.440
In position.

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:19.400
Don't chop, don't chop, don't chop!

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.110
Chop fast, chop fast!

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.640
He said chop faster!

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:25.480
Go!

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:14.200
Charge! Hurry!

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:21.310
Run!

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:22.880
Run, run fast!

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:43.000
Scarface, take care of her.

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:44.110
Go, come on.

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:48.240
Hurry up.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.240
Quick, retreat, retreat!

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:01.680
Sister Hua!

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:02.640
Sister Hua!

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:17.510
Stop.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:24.920
Where is Sister Hua?

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.510
She was with Scarface, right?

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:29.350
Here they come.

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:35.510
Where is Sister Hua?

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.030
She's dead.

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:40.070
There's a blood trail.

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:41.680
Follow the blood trail, chase!

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:49.590
You'll only drag everyone down like this.

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:54.590
Go, hurry up.

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:08.110
Where are the bloodstains?

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.070
They're gone.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.070
You keep chasing. I'll go report.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:26.830
Report!

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:27.510
Reporting, Commander.

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:28.750
We found a trail of blood.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:29.480
Where?

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:30.640
It...

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:32.720
It disappeared.

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:33.750
Commander.

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:36.240
I'll take some men to pursue.

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.070
Hold on.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.030
Division Commander Chen gave orders.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.790
We must preserve our strength.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.790
We have to catch that guy Fan.

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:44.030
And get your revenge.

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.310
I do want revenge.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.790
But chasing further might lead into an ambush.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.400
Since we can already claim victory...

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.750
...we should quit while we're ahead.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.270
Just giving the Huos an explanation will do.

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:55.270
Withdraw.

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:56.310
Commander!

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.110
Withdraw!

00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:58.440
Yes, sir.

00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:00.000
Commander Qin is a piece of trash.

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:01.240
A rotten scumbag.

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:02.830
Playing dumb to take it all.

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:04.960
We spent so much money.

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:07.240
Surely it hasn't gone down the drain?

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:07.880
No way.

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.070
I'm going to find Division Commander Chen.

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:10.590
Stop.

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.480
Who are you to go find him?

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.480
If he really wanted to suppress bandits...

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.070
...it wouldn't end up like this.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.070
These ungrateful people, these insatiable dogs.

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:25.240
A bunch of profit-seeking, greedy jerks.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:26.590
Young Master, all these years...

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:28.270
...you haven't skimped on greasing their palms.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.680
Even a weight dropped in water makes a bubble.

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:32.880
They can't even handle these small matters.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.480
Scum.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.270
Alright, alright, alright.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.640
Calm down.

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:40.240
If these words get out...

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.110
...even I won't be able to save you.

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.880
So what can we do now?

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:49.480
We can't just let it go.

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:50.440
Let it go?

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:52.310
Things have reached this point.

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:53.830
Even God himself couldn't make me let it go.

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:05.720
Don't we still have Xiu Gu in our hands...

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.920
...and her old man?

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:10.200
We just need to keep Fan Sha'er in check.

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:12.160
Fan Sha'er won't just ignore...

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.790
...Xiu Gu and her father.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.510
Come here.

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.200
Take off your pants.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.480
Huh? What? Are you shy?

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:34.590
Take them off yourself.

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:58.960
Is this thing poisonous?

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.640
Us wandering practitioners...

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:03.640
...know a little bit of everything.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.550
It'll get better slowly. Come on.

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:20.750
It does feel better.

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:26.030
How did you know there was a cave here?

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.110
Tiger Ma brought me here before.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.240
I know.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.960
You don't truly want to be a bandit.

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:40.510
I don't want blood on my hands.

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.240
Killing people indiscriminately.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:48.880
In this world...

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.350
it's unavoidable.

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:56.640
Nice guys finish last.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.070
You don't want to kill indiscriminately.

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:01.270
But the one who ends up dead...

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.750
...will be you.

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:07.240
Humans are born good by nature.

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.070
That's what the sages say.

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.920
Why don't we just not go back?

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:16.920
Just walk away.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.440
After how Tiger Ma treated me...

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:21.070
Her sister's life is a life...

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:22.350
but isn't my life a life too?

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.590
I've finally figured it out.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:26.920
Good.

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.270
But I have to go back.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.750
To take the crew with me.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.640
Will your Big Brother listen to you?

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.070
He's just not thinking straight right now.

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:40.680
I'll make him see reason.

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:42.920
When it comes to love...

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:44.550
...can he be woken up?

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:49.110
Even if he hates me...

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:51.440
I can't just stand by...

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:54.640
...and watch him die at Tiger Ma's place.

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:00.590
Counting today...

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:02.790
...you've saved me twice.

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.270
My life...

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:06.240
...is yours.

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.680
You're too serious, too serious.

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:13.880
I wish to become sworn brothers with Brother Fan.

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:15.720
And honor you as my Big Brother.

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:17.030
I'd risk my life for you.

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:19.440
You can't refuse.

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:23.440
You've seen my ass, after all.

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:28.640
Brother.

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.160
Big Brother.

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:02.830
Excuse me.

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:05.550
Is the boss here named Fan?

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:07.960
Who are you?

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:08.720
I am...

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.400
I am the owner of this shop.

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:17.160
There's no one named Fan here.

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:19.790
This shop...

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:21.070
...belongs to the Dong family.

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:27.640
I'm warning you.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:30.240
Don't get involved with anyone named Fan again.
