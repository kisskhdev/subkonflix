WEBVTT

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.190
I can tell that you won.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.400
Of course.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.050
I brought a medal for you too.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.410
Sorry I couldn’t
cheer for you today.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.820
I had an exam in the evening.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.970
It’s okay, I know you
were cheering me in spirit.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.380
Your reward.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.560
What is it?

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.920
Summary of exam topics for Thai,
English, and Social Studies.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.160
Where did you get this from?

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.340
I did it in my free time.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.340
I’m worried you will be too focused
on basketball and forget to study.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.910
You grades won’t be good
enough for university.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.840
We’ll end up in different places.
I don't want to drive far.

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:10.350
Thank you.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.289
A good life is possible
because of you.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.640
But you have to read it.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.100
For science subjects,
I’ll ask my friend to summarize them.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.970
Do you love me?

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:32.650
Of course.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.520
I love you so much.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.020
We’ve been together
since I was in 10th grade.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.080
And now I’m about
to enter university.

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.160
If I hadn’t met you,
I don’t know what my life would be.

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:45.940
Same here.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.190
You’ve taught me that

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.640
a life that matters to
someone else feels different.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.930
What I do for you

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.620
is because I want you
to have a better life

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.930
with me always being a part of it.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.640
So how can I leave you?

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.900
Are you thinking of leaving me?

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.010
- No.
- Huh?

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.630
No.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.260
I love only you.
I love you so much.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.460
I’ll love only you forever.
I love you so much.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.390
So much.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.670
What are you doing?

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:30.400
Kin.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.310
Kin.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.100
My love.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.560
What’s up?

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.240
I played basketball today.
My arm hurts so much.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.780
So?

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.770
Look, my arm is sore.
I can’t even lift it.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.290
I can’t reach the soap.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.230
Is this a joke?

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.170
Come on, what do you think of me?

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.600
You like to tease me.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.500
Than.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.710
You're wet now.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.140
Then let’s shower together.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.480
Could you scrub my back?

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:03.710
Thank you.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:07.630
Come on.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.870
Let me do it for you.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.030
It’s okay.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.280
- Let me do it for you.
- Don’t bother.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.700
Let me do it for you.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.950
The soap fell.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.330
You need to update your trick.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.520
This one is so old.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.120
Shut up.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.550
I can tell who came up with it.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:35.790
Why?

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.670
At least it still works.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.610
This one is good.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:30.150
Excuse me,
where is the finance department?

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:34.320
I understand that love matters,

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:38.310
But life stability is
just as important.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.210
What is it?

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.440
Should I give you a massage?
How about that?

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.420
I’ve never forgotten
anything about us.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.400
Let the past stay in the past.

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.170
Nothing good comes from
digging it all up again.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:54.520
So we decided to find
the best option for you.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:56.290
Than and Nut.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.060
You can just raise it to the front.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.080
Are you okay?

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.350
I’m fine, thanks.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.110
Almost done?

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.850
Please apply
the oil for Than, okay?

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:28.960
Okay.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:31.130
Just a second.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:34.190
Is there a problem?

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.669
Don’t worry. If there’s an issue,
I’ll apply foundation first.

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:40.460
Then I’ll add the oil later.

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:45.450
Akin is the one who
will handle my skin.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.290
I’m a bit shy,
it’s my first time doing this.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.110
I’ve never done anything like this.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:54.070
Could you please call Akin for me?

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.730
Sure.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:58.110
Thank you.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.810
She’s going to apply
the oil on my skin.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.270
So I want you to take care of it.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:17.600
You can do it, right?

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:18.770
Yes.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:20.190
Okay.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:22.630
Thank you.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.820
He seems shy.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.750
I’ll wait outside.
Call me when you're done.

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:28.900
Okay.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:31.010
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.020
You're so demanding.

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.130
Gently, please.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.460
My skin is sensitive.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.580
You rub me too hard.

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:04.310
Aren’t you worried
I might lose control?

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:07.980
Well, you’re doing it hard.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:26.960
You're rubbing me gently.
I’m getting a bit carried away.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.710
Want to do it yourself?

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:38.740
Thank you.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:40.670
This touch

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.600
makes me remember what
we’ve been through more clearly.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.740
You always cared for me sincerely.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.340
You wanted me to have a good life.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.270
Today, I’m just doing my duty.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.520
Just as we agreed.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:57.560
Look me in the eye.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.520
I know you're not good at lying.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.640
Our feelings are
still the same, right?

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.920
Everything has changed now.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.370
Let’s just do our best
in our own roles.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.130
Just live a good life
as you planned.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.350
The life I dreamed of had you.

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:27.030
I’ll try my best to bring
you back into my life.

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.550
The world is no longer just us
like when you were younger.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:36.350
We have to live with
what’s happened.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:44.790
If...

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:48.870
you’re done,please come to the set.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.020
All done. Let’s touch up on set.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.290
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:54.570
Let's go.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.840
Change your pose anytime.
Just relax.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.110
Look at the camera.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.020
Akin, please come this way.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.900
I feel like his neck is a bit bare.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.820
Could you add something
to make it more interesting?

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:27.850
Okay.

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:31.400
Just a sec, Mr. Don feels like
his neck is a bit bare.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:35.430
Costume, can you find a necklace
to add on the model?

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.670
But don’t let it
overshadow the product.

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:38.960
Okay.

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.140
I think a small necklace
would work well.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:49.430
Everyone, let’s take a break now.

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:52.990
Snacks are ready,
come grab something.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.890
I'm possessive.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.550
That might not be good,
people will see.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.000
Put it on nicely.

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:31.060
I’m possessive too.

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:43.840
It should be good now.

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.460
There shouldn’t be any issues.

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.350
Okay, thank you.

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:51.080
You can go to the set now.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.190
- Okay?
- Yes.

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:57.280
How’s it, Mr. Don?

00:13:58.210 --> 00:13:59.040
It’s okay.

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.330
Pond? Is it okay?

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.760
The client likes it, so I’m good.

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:10.550
If it’s okay,
let’s continue shooting.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:12.510
Yes, it’s all good.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Please add some oil.

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:25.230
It’s fine. I can do it myself.

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:27.060
Please take this.

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:51.070
Okay?

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.160
Yes.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.380
Thank you.

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:57.970
Thank you.

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:20.310
What’s wrong?

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:28.160
Ugh, Pond!

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:30.010
What happened?

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.250
The photos are unusable.

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.560
The product looks bad.

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:36.420
Come on, do it better.

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:38.090
Sorry.

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:41.350
I’m tired. I’ll grab a coffee.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.050
Coffee now?

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:48.350
Get a coffee for
my handsome photographer.

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:51.380
It’s okay, I’ll get it myself.
I need to use the bathroom too.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.790
Hurry up then.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:59.170
Sorry about that.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.790
The photos turned out
blurry or something.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.050
Everyone needs to pee.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:11.100
Yeah.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.420
You okay, Mr. Photographer?

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:28.540
I told you to button it properly.

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:39.980
Playing the naughty role?

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:43.600
Do you know
what happens to a naughty kid?

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.330
What?

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:13.470
Hey, who locked it?

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:56.760
Can I check above
to see if they're okay?

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:04.520
Come on, Mr. Don.

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:12.320
My handsome photographer
has his energy back!

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:14.530
Alright, let’s continue shooting.

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:17.310
- You okay?
- I’m good, thanks.

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:18.880
You look relaxed.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.350
Okay, let's go.

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:22.480
Is it good?

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:24.480
I mean is the model good?

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:25.620
Oh, yes.

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:29.480
- Don’t need to add oil.
- Yes, no need to.

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:34.830
Flex your muscles a bit.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:36.350
Great job, Pond.

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:42.650
Is it okay, Akin?

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:45.060
It’s fine.

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:47.100
If it’s okay,

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.550
we’re a little past schedule,
but it’s fine.

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:51.620
We can wrap up now.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.210
Thank you. Thanks, everyone.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.990
Thank you so much. Thank you.

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:04.580
Hey, Kin.

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:06.610
Wait up.

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:20.940
Kin.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.880
Are you running off?

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.290
Running off? I’m going home.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.050
You made me fall for you.

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:32.090
Today,
you’re not make use of me, right?

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.460
When did I make you fall for me?

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.870
If everything I did back then

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:48.370
made you think that
I made you fall for me,

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:50.370
then I don’t know what to say.

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:55.710
I didn’t mean it like that.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.910
I was just rambling.

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:00.430
Sorry.

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:04.360
Can we talk this out?

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:09.650
I’ve always believed that
our story isn’t over.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.100
Today, I’m even more sure.

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:14.780
The way you looked at me this afternoon

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.390
tole me that
you still care about me.

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:18.850
You still love me.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:20.520
I could feel it.

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.940
I don’t know why you left me.

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:29.490
- But if the same feelings...
- It ended that day.

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:01.880
Which day?

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:04.980
Can you tell me?

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:06.840
What did I do wrong?

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:09.400
I want to know.

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.680
So I can explain, apologize,
make it right.

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:15.370
I won’t do it again.

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:18.170
Every time you had something,
you told me.

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:20.180
You warned me.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.280
But why didn’t you
tell me this time?

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:25.540
You just left me

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:28.140
without an explanation.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.260
Our past is still unresolved.

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:35.900
And my feelings are still the same.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.360
Yes.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.940
Something from
the past are still lingering.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:45.900
But at this point,

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:48.720
we have to forget it to move on.

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:51.920
Can you really forget it?

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:54.360
I’ve never forgotten it.

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:56.810
I know.

00:22:58.050 --> 00:22:59.360
You never forgot either.

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.110
Do you still remember how it felt?

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.410
Do you feel anything?

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.800
I don’t.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:49.340
That's not true.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.390
I know.

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:53.890
I know you still feel it.

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:02.640
It’s not something
you can easily forget.

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:05.510
But today,

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.080
I don't feel it anymore.

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.870
See?

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:27.140
Do you believe me now?
There’s really no feeling left.

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:30.830
I’m glad.

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.030
That we got to meet again.

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.050
But don’t let the past

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.400
pull us back into the pain again.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.420
Thanks for your help today.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:05.780
It’s okay.

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:09.520
I’m still here.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.600
I’m always still here with you.

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:24.550
Something from the past
are still lingering.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:25.910
But at this point,

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:28.110
we have to forget it to move on.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.310
Can you really forget it?

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:33.450
I’ve never forgotten it.

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:35.820
I know.

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:38.010
Do you still remember how it felt?

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.450
So what are you going to do now?

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:14.740
I don’t know either.

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.270
What did he say when you asked?

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.890
He said he didn’t know
what I was talking about.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.200
What did you ask him?

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:25.630
I asked...

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:29.910
When I wasn’t around, did he...

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:32.360
Did he ever sleep with
anyone else, right?

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:36.120
And he said no, never.

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:38.110
He only loves you. Is that right?

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:41.500
Do you remember my ex, Non?

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.990
That’s exactly what he said.

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.480
Who would admit that?

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:49.380
Did you ask him
if he knew the woman?

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:50.920
How did he get her number?

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.260
I asked. But he said...

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.130
He didn’t know her.

00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:01.160
And there were
no messages nor calls from her.

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:03.610
Except that one time
she called at the basketball court.

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:08.230
Who would leave the evidence?

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:12.630
I’ve done it before.
I know what to do to hide it.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.760
Trust me. Stop being naive
and stop being foolish.

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.490
Do you remember when he got
his neck kissed by a girl?

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:20.850
What did he tell you?

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:23.550
He said it was an ant bite,
and you actually believed him.

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:26.490
Do you really think
an ant bite looks like that?

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:28.620
You can ask a 6th grader,

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.550
I bet they’d know
what that mark is.

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:36.350
A kiss mark, a sign of possession.

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:38.380
It means, “he's mine.”

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.820
And there’s the time he stayed
overnight at his friend’s place.

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.450
Everything for having sex
was on the bed.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.970
I don’t think anything
happened back then.

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:50.320
I don't know how to curse you now.

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:54.110
You’re totally clueless,
no sense at all.

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:56.190
His friend just wanted to show off.

00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:00.190
So she took a selfie
and posted it to tell the world.

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:03.810
“I slept with Thanwa
of the Sports Science”

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:08.160
She tagged it so you could see.

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:14.210
So you could start a fight,
then she'll apologize and comfort him.

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.450
She'll steal him from you.

00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:19.660
But he's lucky to have
a good boyfriend like you.

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.530
You believe everything he says.

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:24.720
He knows you love him,
he gets whatever he wants.

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:26.640
That’s why he keeps doing this.

00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:28.600
But I think this time,
he’s gone too far.

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.360
You mean...

00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:35.230
You two want me to...

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:36.500
Break up.

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:40.080
How many chances
have you given him?

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:44.120
Do you really think he deserves
another chance from you?

00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:47.710
Trust me.

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:50.540
Giving him another chance
will just be the same.

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:52.080
You won’t be able to change him.

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.700
And trust me, you won’t get
the truth out of him either.

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:58.140
I know because I’m just like him.

00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:59.950
I say whatever I want too.

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:02.050
My girlfriend never
knew the truth from me

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:03.290
unless I decide to tell her.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.010
Where is he now?

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.240
That day when I yelled at him,

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:12.410
he asked to go stay with
his parents for a couple of days.

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:14.980
So I could have peace of mind.

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:18.600
But there was something going on,
so he decided to stay longer.

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:20.230
Trust me.

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:22.920
He’s definitely dealing
with this situation.

00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:26.860
The liquor’s finished.
Do you want to keep drinking?

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:28.570
Or do you want to eat grasses?

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:32.750
I know.

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.560
You love him so much.

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:37.980
But you...

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:40.380
Please open your eyes.

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:46.400
We love you a lot,
that’s why we’re being honest.

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:00.770
Kin?

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:31.460
Hello?

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:32.280
This is Than.

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:34.790
I came back to the room
but couldn't find Kin.

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:36.180
Did you see him at university?

00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:38.220
He went to England.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:41.280
I just dropped him off at
the airport a couple of days ago.

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:42.850
He went to England?

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:46.260
Yeah, he went to visit his parents.

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:48.580
And to look into further studies.

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:51.900
When is he coming back?

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:55.820
It might be a while.
He’s finished his assignments.

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:59.260
Next term,
he only has one more project.

00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:03.890
Honestly, I think you should
just let him go.

00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:07.920
I know my friend is a good person,
and he loves you a lot.

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:11.730
But I’m not sure how much
you love him in return.

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.230
If you loved him more than this,

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:16.220
he wouldn’t have to feel hurt
because of you.

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:18.290
Let him find someone better.

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:12.730
I didn’t expect you to call.

00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:14.920
Is there something you need?

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:18.300
Mom?

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:20.980
Can I eat this?

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:23.239
Say hello to your uncle first.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.469
Hello, Uncle. My name is Mawin.

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:29.110
What’s your name?

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:31.850
Hello, I’m Akin.

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:34.600
Are you a friend of my mom?

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.310
He is a friend of mine.

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:39.570
He’s known you since you were born.

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:42.960
He has been living abroad
and just came back to Thailand.

00:34:44.219 --> 00:34:45.850
And what you've got there?

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:48.219
Can I eat it, please?

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:51.270
Sure, but just one piece, okay?

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:52.600
Okay.

00:34:53.739 --> 00:34:56.570
Would you like some?
It’s really delicious.

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.220
I’ll give you a piece.

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:00.640
No, thank you.

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.210
You eat it.

00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:04.390
Thank you for sharing.

00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:17.290
You kept him.

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:19.120
He didn’t do anything wrong.

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:22.360
He has the right to live
his life on this earth.

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:29.700
Are you still in touch
with his father?

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:33.680
He only has his mother.
He doesn’t have a father.

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:41.890
Can I stay?

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:44.070
I want to stay with you.

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.230
I want to see you every day.

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:49.080
But we still get to see each other.

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:51.640
On weekends, you’ll be with me.

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:54.510
I want to study at a school nearby.

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:57.950
I don't want to go to
a good school like you said.

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:01.650
If you go therel,
you’ll make good friends.

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:04.880
Trust me,
when you meet new friends,

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:06.520
you’ll love it.

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:10.180
And your school is close
to my condo too.

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.590
When you finish school,
I can pick him up right away.

00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:17.580
Last time you went to my condo,
you said you liked the swimming pool.

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:19.720
You can there every day.

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:24.220
When you are sick
and need to take medicine,

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:26.410
who will get the water for you?

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:29.520
I have my doctor
to take care of me.

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:32.750
I have to go to the hospital
often these days.

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:34.730
Sometimes, I have to
stay overnight.

00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:38.440
If you stay at the shop with me,
I’ll be worried.

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.130
That’s why I asked him
to take care of you

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:42.870
during the times
I'm not feeling well.

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:47.620
I can stay at the shop.
I'm grown up now.

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:53.990
Come stay with me.
If you miss her, just call her.

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:55.880
Or you can video call her.

00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:59.740
When I close the shop,
I'll come to visit you.

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:02.550
And don’t forget to take me out.

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:05.560
There aren’t many places
to visit around here.

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:08.730
But you’ll have fun there,
don’t you think?

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:12.160
I love you, Mom.

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:15.340
I love you too, Mawin.

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:22.710
There’s someone else who loves you
just like I do.

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:24.440
Do you know who it is?

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:26.160
Uncle Akin.

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:31.250
You’ve often told me that
you want a dad like others.

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:36.710
What if we let him be your dad now?

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.340
When you’re not with me,
you’ll still have this dad.

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:46.440
So when I'm not with you,

00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:49.450
can I call you Dad?

00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:51.720
Sure.

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:54.560
You can call me anything you want.

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:59.530
Dad, promise me
you'll bring me to see her often.

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:02.330
I promise to be a good boy.

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:07.630
That’s great. I’ll visit you often.

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:11.430
When you miss me,
ask him to video call me.

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:13.440
That way, we’ll feel close.

00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:18.290
Yes, I promise
I’ll call you every day.

00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:21.650
You promise you'll visit me, right?

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:23.790
I promise you.

00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:29.640
I’ll take care of him
like he’s my own child.

00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:31.640
I promise you too.

00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:16.070
Hello, Uncle.

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:17.980
What’s up, Mawin?

00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:21.130
Today, I made clay with Mom.

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:22.760
So I want to show it to you.

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:28.470
It looks great!
You did an excellent job.

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:32.240
When are you coming to pick you up?

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:35.820
Hmm... how about in two days?

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:37.830
Can we make it three days instead?

00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:39.740
I still miss Mom too much.

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:42.640
Okay, I'll see you
in three days then.

00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:43.930
Okay.

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:25.270
Go up to your room,
take a shower, and rest.

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:27.670
You’ll feel better tomorrow.

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.050
Things like this take time.

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:51.080
It’s late. You should go to bed.

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:55.550
Okay. I miss you.
Let’s meet again soon.

00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:58.120
I miss you too. Sweet dreams.

00:40:59.090 --> 00:40:59.960
Goodbye.

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:25.470
Kin.

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:39.130
Kin.

00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:43.330
I know you’re standing there.

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:47.790
And I also know

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:50.700
that you lied to me about the kiss.

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:55.200
Our feelings are still the same.

00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:57.820
Nothing has changed.

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:03.250
Can you come out and tell me

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:09.680
that everything between us
is still the same?

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:12.430
That you still love me

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:15.260
just like I love you?

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:21.430
If you don’t want
to say it out loud,

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:25.300
you can just tap once to respond

00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:27.610
to show that
we still feel the same.

00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:30.860
If you tap once,

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:32.850
it means...

00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:37.840
you don’t feel anything
for me anymore.

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:41.650
But if you tap twice,

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:46.750
it means you still feel
the same way as I do.

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:02.020
Can you hear me?

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.230
You can tap to reply.

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:15.760
Please answer me.

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:18.870
I’m waiting for your answer.

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:44.340
Waiting at a door that seems like
it will never open

00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:49.920
makes me question whether

00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:53.540
I should still be here.

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:09.500
Are you okay? I can stay with you.

00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:07.180
Trust me,

00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:10.090
No matter how many chances
you give, he’ll always be the same.

00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:11.560
You’ll never change him.

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:55.850
Are you sure you’re okay?

00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:02.950
I understand.

00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:06.560
When we try,
but it doesn’t work out,

00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:09.240
it hurts much.

00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:11.840
Because I’ve been there.

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:15.320
Have you ever seen me give up?

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:21.120
Even now,
I still have a little hope left.

00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:28.060
Are you talking about me...

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:30.470
and you?

00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:32.590
Yes.

00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:35.400
I admit it.

00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:38.090
Even though
you’ve told me ten times

00:48:39.370 --> 00:48:41.040
that we can only be friends,

00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:45.560
deep down,

00:48:48.690 --> 00:48:51.040
I still hope you’ll give me
a chance someday.

00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:55.240
Bro.

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:58.240
Hey, I’m being honest.

00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:03.680
And what does this
have to do with this?

00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:05.790
It’s related.

00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:08.990
Because Than I know

00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:11.670
isn’t someone who will easily give up.

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:18.060
Or maybe...

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:21.290
When something breaks,

00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:24.130
we should let it be.

00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:27.840
It can’t be fixed anymore.

00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:32.930
Than.

00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:38.000
Do you remember
the first exercise machine

00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:41.050
that broke down after
we used it for a long time?

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:44.020
The repairman said
it couldn’t be fixed.

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:46.530
But it was you

00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:49.130
who told us to try fixing it first.

00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:51.170
To try fixing it completely.

00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:55.110
And in the end,
it worked just fine.

00:49:58.430 --> 00:49:59.820
It’s different, bro.

00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:03.130
This is a person with feelings.

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:05.510
And the thing is,

00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:08.950
I don’t even know
what he’s thinking.

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:11.360
It’s been years now.

00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:14.750
Maybe,

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:17.480
it’s too late.

00:50:18.690 --> 00:50:22.050
If it matters enough,
there’s no such thing as too late.

00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:24.400
You said that.

00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:27.210
You should ask your own heart.

00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:32.680
Is he important enough
for you to keep trying?

00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:51.500
Thank you for seeing me

00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:53.930
on the days
when I can't see myself.

00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:57.060
The door may be closed,

00:50:57.330 --> 00:51:00.750
but no matter how many times,
I'll knock

00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:04.470
until he opens his heart.

00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:12.350
Yeah, that’s how it should be.

00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:14.100
Than I know

00:51:16.530 --> 00:51:20.290
tries again so it doesn’t
end the same way.

00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:25.460
No matter how long it takes,

00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:27.660
I’ll never stop trying.

00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:35.520
The second branch of the gym, too.

00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:38.380
The sales have to rise,
and it needs to be packed.

00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:41.000
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:51.860
Fight on!

00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:03.360
Can I try a bite?

00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:13.330
I saw the brochure of the condo.
Are you moving out?

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:15.540
Do you want me to?

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:18.300
If you want me to,

00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:21.690
I’ll tell other people
that we’re dating.

00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:25.160
So it violates our agreement.

00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:26.980
Who dates you?

00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:33.050
Seriously, how long do
we have to keep this quiet?

00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:35.800
Are you embarrassed to date
a photographer like me?

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:37.640
What do you think?

00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:39.980
Probably a little.

00:52:41.310 --> 00:52:43.530
Look at how different
you and I are.

00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:47.560
If I were handsome, fair-skinned,
and a pretty boy,

00:52:47.590 --> 00:52:49.060
you'd probably announce me
to the world.

00:52:51.790 --> 00:52:54.170
Do you still want to
maintain professionalism?

00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:55.490
Why?

00:52:56.170 --> 00:52:59.160
Many companies don't allow
dating within the workplace.

00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:01.280
I’m not part of Beyond Perfect.

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:02.780
And neither are you.

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:05.990
Also, Too doesn't have such rules.

00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:08.210
Well, think about it.

00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:12.330
If people find out we're dating
and living together like this

00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:15.250
and when I have work,
I choose you as the photographer,

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:18.440
Next job, it’ll still be you...

00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:21.920
The next job too, it's you.

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:23.770
Sure, because I’m good.

00:53:24.370 --> 00:53:27.750
They might think you got
the job for another reason,

00:53:28.570 --> 00:53:29.940
not because of your skills.

00:53:32.730 --> 00:53:35.810
When you choose me for work,
is it because I’m good,

00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:39.090
or is it something else
that stands out?

00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:42.520
I’m confident in
my professionalism.

00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:47.670
Just asking, no need to be serious.

00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:50.030
Alright, let’s stick with the deal.

00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:51.970
Why are you looking for
a new place?

00:53:53.130 --> 00:53:53.830
I don't know.

00:53:54.790 --> 00:53:58.440
Maybe you’ll feel uncomfortable
having someone living with you.

00:53:59.330 --> 00:54:01.280
Honestly, you can tell me.

00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:02.910
I’m ready to move out.

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:05.230
I’m used to it.

00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:09.790
Used to it or like it? Be honest.

00:54:14.830 --> 00:54:17.820
Done? Then, can I have some?

00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:29.380
What desserts do you have today?

00:54:29.950 --> 00:54:34.240
Special menu, Obsidian Dark
Chocolate Lava with Coco Caviar.

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:37.820
The Lava is dark chocolate,
served with rich cocoa pearls.

00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:41.680
And Ivory Creme Brulee
with White Tea Syrup.

00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:45.410
I’ll have the dark chocolate,
but no pearls.

00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:47.400
You like it strong, huh?

00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:48.680
What about you?

00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:50.110
Same for me.

00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:54.130
But I’ll have the pearls.
I like it.

00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:57.160
- You don’t like pearls?
- Hey!

00:54:58.290 --> 00:54:59.150
Table manners.

00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:01.770
Table manners.

00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:06.400
That’s all for now.

00:55:11.330 --> 00:55:14.810
Are we going anywhere
or just head back?

00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:19.660
Just going back.
I’m sleepy. I want to sleep.

00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:24.400
You think you can sleep?

00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:34.820
The Resort De Puskani is
a newly renovated resort

00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:38.510
with white as a replacement for
the sand and blue for the sea.

00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:40.750
It’s inspired by a fishing village.

00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:43.250
Hmm, nice.

00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:45.470
Thanks a lot, Akin.

00:55:45.810 --> 00:55:47.700
Does anyone have
any more questions?

00:55:50.130 --> 00:55:53.010
We haven’t partied in a while.
Should we have a small one?

00:55:53.610 --> 00:55:56.660
Are you crazy?
We’re supposed to discuss work!

00:55:57.260 --> 00:55:58.240
I'll never let you pass.

00:56:00.830 --> 00:56:02.280
So no one else?

00:56:02.730 --> 00:56:04.620
If not, let’s call it a day.

00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:06.350
- Alright.
- Thank you.

00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:11.050
Rowing the boat, deep waters flow,
thinking of the one who rows.

00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:14.810
Rowing the boat, deep waters flow,
thinking of the one who rows.

00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:18.290
Rowing the boat to Phayao,
rowing the boat to Phayao.

00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:20.670
Who wants to get drunk,
get up and row!

00:56:20.690 --> 00:56:24.180
Rowing the boat, deep waters flow,
thinking of the one who rows.

00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:27.030
Rowing the boat, deep waters flow,
thinking of the one who rows.

00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:29.870
I’ll meet you at the restaurant,
same table.

00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:31.320
Oh, let's go.

00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:34.030
Rowing the boat, deep waters flow,
Let's go, Fai.

00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:35.450
See you at the restaurant.

00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:40.460
Akin, are you coming?

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:41.780
Where to?

00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:44.430
AJ wants to go party.
The same place.

00:56:45.330 --> 00:56:48.900
Nah,I need to pick up
Mawin from his mom’s.

00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:53.440
Work’s pretty loaded.
Are you alright?

00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:54.840
Should I get you some help?

00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:56.390
I’m good, thanks.

00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:58.150
Make sure you get some rest.

00:56:58.390 --> 00:57:00.050
Go to the gym, work out a bit.

00:57:00.330 --> 00:57:02.670
Your health KPI might suffer.

00:57:03.610 --> 00:57:04.380
Sure.

00:57:05.130 --> 00:57:06.160
Honestly, Akin...

00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:09.590
Lately, I feel like you’re not
as bright as before.

00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:11.230
Is there something going on?

00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:13.110
Is it something at home?

00:57:14.250 --> 00:57:14.970
It’s nothing.

00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:19.160
I know you’re alone in Thailand.

00:57:19.630 --> 00:57:20.730
Your parents are far away.

00:57:21.350 --> 00:57:23.660
If you need to talk, I’m here.

00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:26.750
I want this company to be like
another home for you.

00:57:27.250 --> 00:57:29.150
We can talk about anything.

00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:32.670
And I believe that when
our personal life is good,

00:57:33.070 --> 00:57:34.460
your work life will be good too.

00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:37.520
Thank you.

00:57:38.970 --> 00:57:39.780
You know what?

00:57:40.550 --> 00:57:44.570
A truly skilled person doesn’t
only handle work well.

00:57:45.570 --> 00:57:48.560
They also manage their emotions
and feelings well.

00:57:49.790 --> 00:57:52.570
They’re brave enough to admit
what they really want in life.

00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:55.310
Sometimes, work can wait

00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:56.840
because there’s a deadline.

00:57:57.630 --> 00:58:00.230
But something needs to be
dealt with right away.

00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:01.900
Don’t let them linger

00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:04.310
because it could be too late.

00:58:07.550 --> 00:58:07.960
Okay.

00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:15.220
I’m leaving now.

00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:17.150
Okay.

00:58:55.010 --> 00:58:56.390
Someone’s here to see you.

00:58:57.320 --> 00:58:57.750
Okay.

00:59:42.670 --> 00:59:45.060
Let’s start over.

01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:02.350
Let’s go on a trip.

01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:05.140
Akin, when did you start dating?

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:06.470
How come you didn’t tell me?

01:00:06.490 --> 01:00:08.270
But with all these hearts,

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.970
won't he think you're
a little two-faced?

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.520
They'll have
New Year party at school.

01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:15.490
But we need to find an outfit too.

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:18.380
We just started dating
so let’s take it slow.

01:00:19.830 --> 01:00:20.730
It’s not over yet.

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:22.840
You need dessert to finish, right?

01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:24.680
Is that Akin?
