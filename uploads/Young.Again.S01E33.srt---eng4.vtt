WEBVTT

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.120
Let me ask you.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.900
Our Ms. Liu...

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.239
starred in the movie Flowers of the Motherland back then.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.739
What year, month, and day did it premiere?

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.760
You even remember that?

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:06.939
Even I've forgotten.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.599
I really don't know.

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.039
Don't know, do you?

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.599
Let me ask you another one.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.539
Back then, the movie Flowers of the Motherland...

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.860
was at...

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:15.539
Hold on a second.

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.439
You haven't told us the answer yet.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.580
What was the exact year, month, and day?

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:21.539
I'll tell you.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.580
I don't know either.

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:24.979
You don't know, yet you're quizzing us?

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:26.740
When did I say I knew?

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.680
Let me test you then

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.900
In the movie *Flowers of the Motherland*

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.879
Ms. Liu has a line

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.180
"Uncle"

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:38.300
"When I grow up, I'll join the army"

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.479
What did the uncle say?

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.860
The uncle said

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:44.939
"Little friend, you are very ambitious"

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.840
Wrong

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:48.159
The uncle didn't answer

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.259
How is that possible?

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.479
As an uncle

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.960
How could he be so rude?

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:55.819
Because the scene cut to the next one

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:56.919
Grandma Liu

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.060
Hello Boss Li, Professor Fan

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:01.000
Hello, Grandma Liu

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:03.539
Thank you for giving us the acting lecture

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.240
This is a gift from us

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:06.800
Thank you

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.979
What is this?

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:08.259
Yeah

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:09.479
It's a Magic Bean

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:11.000
It's very popular right now

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.740
Just open it

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.719
Water it a bit

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.240
And it will sprout in a few days

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.860
On the leaves

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.319
Words will appear

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.919
These two

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.300
One is a Career Bean

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:22.759
One is called a Love Bean

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:23.419
It's really fun

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:24.599
Amazing

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:25.000
It really is

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.379
That's wonderful

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:27.479
I really

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.939
Oh, I can't

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.479
I'm going traveling tomorrow

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:32.620
I... I...

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.000
Leave that to me then

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.020
I'll grow it for you

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:37.039
I'm the best at growing flowers and plants

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.819
Wait a minute

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:40.919
That succulent of yours the other day

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.139
Didn't you kill it?

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.259
Such a drought-resistant desert plant

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.900
And you managed to kill it

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.919
You really are an expert

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.060
Is that so?

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.699
Then...

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:54.919
Let me do it

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.159
I'm someone who has actually grown crops

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:59.180
And raised farm produce

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.379
You

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.580
You grew crops?

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.620
Then why did you trick me

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.280
Into watering a desert plant non-stop?

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:08.539
As soon as I see this Magic Bean

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.240
I think of my succulent

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.560
It died so miserably

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:14.520
Is that

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.639
How you raise crops?

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.139
No, well...

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:17.639
Well...

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:18.540
No, it's just...

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.500
If Old Li...

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:22.120
As long as he doesn't interfere

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.720
I will definitely take care of this Magic Bean personally

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.879
I promise

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:27.800
Like I cherish my own eyes

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.379
I will cherish it

00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:30.740
That would be bad

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.040
Look at how he

00:04:32.079 --> 00:04:33.699
Cherishes his own eyes

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.259
Reading, writing, staring at the computer

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:38.480
He literally ruined his eyes

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.339
Into severe nearsightedness

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.600
You'd better give it to me

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.759
Give it to me

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:43.379
Give it to me

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.720
Alright

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.980
Grandpas

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.120
I can definitely grow it well

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.160
Let's not argue

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.759
I actually have a good idea

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:48.699
If you ask me

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.000
You two

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.740
Take one each

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.439
See

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.160
Who can make the words appear first

00:04:55.579 --> 00:04:56.100
Good

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.240
One box of love

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:01.720
Yes

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.500
One box of career

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.939
Right

00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:04.220
Which box is career?

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.480
And which box is love?

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.360
You don't know, do you?

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.600
Let me tell you

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:10.019
I don't know either

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:11.319
Nonsense again

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.839
But I have a way to find out

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:13.680
What way?

00:05:14.579 --> 00:05:15.740
Wait for words to grow on it

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.920
That's like saying nothing

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.220
Old Li

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:19.519
You don't understand this

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.120
The words on these leaves

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.079
don't appear all at once

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.980
They come out bit by bit

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:27.620
At first, you have to guess

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.879
How about this

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.779
The two of us

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.959
let's each claim one first

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.259
How about we raise them together?

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.139
Nurture a seed of love together

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.660
Ridiculous

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.660
So you mean we raise them separately

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:39.120
Yes

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.860
The key point

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.560
isn't about what words grow

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:44.959
it's about whether words will grow at all

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:46.879
That makes sense

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.980
If

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.120
your bean dies

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:52.819
and my bean grows words

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:54.720
then no matter the word, I'm the winner

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.860
We don't know whose bean will die first yet

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.420
Then let's have a contest

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:01.439
You're on

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:05.839
Xiaoxin

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:07.019
You got a new phone?

00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:09.459
My boyfriend bought it for me

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.660
Your boyfriend treats you pretty well

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:14.079
It's true love between us

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.420
Then do you dare to test him?

00:06:17.019 --> 00:06:18.180
Test him how?

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:19.220
Like this

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.939
Say you lost your phone

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.579
Ask him to buy you another one

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.139
See if his love for you is worth two phones

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.379
What do I need two phones for?

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:28.480
Give one to me

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.879
I've been wanting a new phone recently

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.220
Don't tell me our Xiaoxin

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.439
is only worth two phones?

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.339
At least three

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:37.240
I want a new phone too

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:39.639
Her boyfriend isn't short of three phones

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:41.100
As long as our Xiaoxin asks

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.259
one for each of us

00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:43.160
Xiaoxin

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:44.019
Try it

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.279
Why should I?

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.279
Am I stupid?

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:47.680
You're not stupid

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:49.040
Your taste is just a bit poor

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.480
Her taste isn't poor

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:53.300
She just has a good heart

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.879
Right

00:06:53.959 --> 00:06:55.879
If you help, help the classmates in most need

00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:57.079
If we're talking need

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.220
who's more in need than you two?

00:06:58.279 --> 00:06:59.019
Xiaoxin

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:00.279
Don't listen to them

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:02.120
I think your boyfriend is quite nice

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:04.060
Down-to-earth and low-key

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:05.439
Faithful and obedient

00:07:05.459 --> 00:07:06.019
Right

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.800
We just like that he's dumb

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.000
That he's a good person

00:09:36.539 --> 00:09:37.500
Can't sleep.

00:09:39.379 --> 00:09:40.299
Might as well read a book.

00:09:42.379 --> 00:09:44.120
It is now...

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:45.740
three o'clock.

00:09:47.279 --> 00:09:49.320
Read until six in the morning.

00:09:50.379 --> 00:09:51.779
Then exercise.

00:09:52.639 --> 00:09:54.120
Then breakfast.

00:09:54.659 --> 00:09:56.000
Then sleep a bit more.

00:09:57.519 --> 00:09:59.320
Reading in bed...

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:01.759
for three hours is so comfortable.

00:10:02.919 --> 00:10:05.139
But lying on the floor for three hours...

00:10:05.139 --> 00:10:06.200
can't be comfortable.

00:10:07.639 --> 00:10:08.919
Can you still get up?

00:10:10.279 --> 00:10:12.000
Don't catch a cold now.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:17.519
Professor Fan.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:19.779
What are you doing?

00:10:20.159 --> 00:10:21.360
What kind of kung fu are you practicing?

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:22.679
No...

00:10:23.299 --> 00:10:23.840
I...

00:10:24.159 --> 00:10:24.820
I am...

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.779
My sleepwalking habit is acting up again.

00:10:26.779 --> 00:10:27.539
Sorry about that.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:28.299
It's fine.

00:10:28.659 --> 00:10:29.539
As long as you're happy.

00:10:29.919 --> 00:10:31.220
You can roam under my bed all you want.

00:10:31.919 --> 00:10:32.840
You can lie there as long as you like.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:34.480
Alright.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:35.879
I admit it.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:36.879
I wanted to...

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.919
see how your Magic Beans are growing.

00:10:39.019 --> 00:10:40.139
You're welcome to look at the Magic Beans too.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.240
If I had known...

00:10:42.419 --> 00:10:44.679
I would have put the Magic Beans under my bed.

00:10:44.759 --> 00:10:45.820
That way, while you're lying there...

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:46.639
you could watch them.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.159
Go back to sleep.

00:10:49.019 --> 00:10:50.000
I'm going back now.

00:10:51.019 --> 00:10:52.100
Won't lie there a bit longer?

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:02.460
Students.

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.340
I just want to ask...

00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:06.120
those two Magic Beans you bought...

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:08.059
which one is the Love Bean...

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.120
and which one is the Career Bean?

00:11:09.659 --> 00:11:10.399
Professor Fan.

00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:11.679
Is that all you wanted to ask?

00:11:12.379 --> 00:11:13.320
I don't know either.

00:11:15.139 --> 00:11:16.580
Then when you bought them...

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.279
how did you know there were two types?

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:19.919
There was packaging.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.039
It was written on the packaging.

00:11:21.039 --> 00:11:21.799
Wait a moment.

00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:26.580
This one is the Love Bean.

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:27.759
This one is the Career Bean.

00:11:27.799 --> 00:11:29.460
Great, I'll take the Love Bean.

00:11:29.759 --> 00:11:30.600
No, wait.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.460
These two pieces of paper...

00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:34.179
which one wrapped which?

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:35.279
I forgot.

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:37.240
I remember now.

00:11:37.519 --> 00:11:39.399
The young lady selling the Magic Beans...

00:11:39.399 --> 00:11:40.919
looked at the bottom of the box.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.279
Maybe there's a mark on the bottom of the box.

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:44.980
Professor Fan, do you thi...

00:11:45.679 --> 00:11:46.399
Professor Fan.

00:11:46.779 --> 00:11:47.600
Professor Fan.

00:11:53.179 --> 00:11:53.899
Old Li.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.019
Why are you back?

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.580
I'm entering my own room.

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:57.460
Without knocking?

00:11:58.019 --> 00:11:59.200
What are you doing sneaking around?

00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:00.740
Do I need to come in again?

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.480
Enough, Old Li.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.379
What are you doing?

00:12:03.679 --> 00:12:05.519
I just wanted to look at your Magic Bean box.

00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:06.720
Do you have to be so stingy?

00:12:07.179 --> 00:12:09.580
You were clearly plotting against my Magic Bean box.

00:12:09.779 --> 00:12:11.120
And I caught you red-handed.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:12.840
And you act like the victim.

00:12:13.519 --> 00:12:14.980
Who's plotting?

00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:16.840
Who did you catch red-handed?

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:17.659
Then what were you doing?

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:18.799
You lack curiosity.

00:12:18.799 --> 00:12:19.740
You have no ambition.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.840
Have you never thought...

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.840
to study these two Magic Bean boxes?

00:12:24.259 --> 00:12:25.080
Study what?

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.220
Don't you want to know...

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.159
which one is the Love Bean...

00:12:27.159 --> 00:12:28.200
and which one is the Career Bean?

00:12:28.559 --> 00:12:29.659
I couldn't care less.

00:12:31.779 --> 00:12:32.500
Which one?

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:34.980
You tell me which is which.

00:12:35.019 --> 00:12:36.279
Do you want me to tell you?

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:39.940
Tell me or don't.

00:12:40.679 --> 00:12:41.720
If not, forget it.

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:42.840
You have to beg me.

00:12:43.019 --> 00:12:44.440
Why should I tell you if you don't beg me?

00:12:51.399 --> 00:12:52.620
I beg you

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:53.799
You're begging me?

00:12:54.379 --> 00:12:55.659
Shouldn't you apologize first?

00:12:55.659 --> 00:12:57.100
I apologize

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:59.179
Is this attitude sincere?

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:00.820
If you don't tell me, forget it

00:13:01.059 --> 00:13:02.139
Fine, I'll tell you

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.120
Look at these two boxes

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:08.820
Under this box,

00:13:09.039 --> 00:13:09.799
it says L

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.299
Under this box,

00:13:11.539 --> 00:13:12.320
it says A

00:13:13.019 --> 00:13:13.899
What does it mean?

00:13:14.779 --> 00:13:15.919
I reckon...

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.419
Everyone,

00:13:19.759 --> 00:13:21.399
I know which one is the Love Bean

00:13:21.559 --> 00:13:22.639
How do you know?

00:13:24.299 --> 00:13:25.700
Under the two Magic Bean boxes,

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.159
there is a letter on each

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.620
One is L,

00:13:28.639 --> 00:13:29.340
one is A

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:31.659
What does that represent?

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:32.659
It's obvious

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.220
L is LOVE

00:13:34.279 --> 00:13:35.600
Love

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.340
Makes sense

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:39.120
Knowing English is useful

00:13:39.399 --> 00:13:41.259
Then what does A mean?

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:42.379
It should be Ambition

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:44.659
Translated as having ambition

00:13:45.039 --> 00:13:45.580
Professor,

00:13:45.879 --> 00:13:47.139
your analysis might not be right

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.259
Young people today don't like using English

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.840
But these are English letters

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.100
It's Hanyu Pinyin

00:13:52.679 --> 00:13:54.120
The A in Hanyu Pinyin,

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.080
means Love

00:13:56.659 --> 00:13:57.639
That also makes sense

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.320
So which one is right?

00:13:59.379 --> 00:14:00.919
They both make sense

00:14:01.139 --> 00:14:02.299
I think,

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.679
it's more likely to be Hanyu Pinyin

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:06.639
The young lady selling Magic Beans,

00:14:06.639 --> 00:14:08.059
would she use the word "Ambition"?

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.059
So it has to be Hanyu Pinyin

00:14:10.259 --> 00:14:12.059
Then what is L?

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.120
Lucky

00:14:13.159 --> 00:14:14.080
It's Lucky

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.340
Look at our English

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.159
Is that Hanyu Pinyin?

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.659
No

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.879
I think L is Ideal

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.159
I guess L is Blueprint

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:23.620
No

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.000
It could be Dragon Head

00:14:25.039 --> 00:14:26.600
A leading enterprise

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.200
It could also be Leader

00:14:28.279 --> 00:14:29.919
Why isn't it Boss?

00:14:30.299 --> 00:14:30.779
Fine

00:14:30.779 --> 00:14:31.220
Alright

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.559
Whatever it is,

00:14:32.799 --> 00:14:33.759
as long as it's not Love,

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.679
I'm going back to swap it right now

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:48.779
You

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:49.980
You didn't go out?

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:50.620
No.

00:14:51.539 --> 00:14:52.700
Did I interrupt your sleepwalking?

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:53.679
I'll leave right now.

00:14:54.299 --> 00:14:54.860
Don't joke.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:55.700
Stop joking.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.700
I just wanted to ask you.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:14:59.559
You, this Magic Bean...

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:00.620
That thing...

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:02.559
How is it growing?

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:03.779
It's growing well.

00:15:04.379 --> 00:15:05.539
Growing faster than you.

00:15:05.899 --> 00:15:06.779
Big surprise.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:08.539
If I grew anymore, I'd be a monster.

00:15:08.539 --> 00:15:09.320
Monster.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.820
Planning something bad again?

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.100
Who's a monster?

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:13.559
Who?

00:15:13.639 --> 00:15:14.500
Who's planning bad things?

00:15:14.799 --> 00:15:15.879
You really are a dog biting Lü Dongbin.

00:15:15.879 --> 00:15:16.820
Not recognizing a good heart.

00:15:17.159 --> 00:15:18.039
You think you're...

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.039
Lü Dongbin?

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.059
I'm the dog biting...

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:22.980
Who's the dog?

00:15:23.139 --> 00:15:24.240
Can we settle down for a bit?

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:24.940
Settle down.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:25.860
I want to discuss something with you.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:26.460
Discuss something.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.100
What is it?

00:15:28.019 --> 00:15:30.659
Do you want this Love Magic Bean?

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.940
I have, after deep consideration,

00:15:34.139 --> 00:15:36.500
decided to give my Love Magic Bean

00:15:36.639 --> 00:15:37.299
to you.

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.139
How do you know yours

00:15:40.299 --> 00:15:42.240
is a Love Magic Bean?

00:15:42.279 --> 00:15:43.179
That's simple.

00:15:43.559 --> 00:15:44.960
Love is called "Love".

00:15:45.039 --> 00:15:45.740
You know this.

00:15:47.139 --> 00:15:48.360
It's this "L".

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:50.320
Look.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.299
It really is.

00:15:54.059 --> 00:15:55.159
Then I won't stand on ceremony.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.419
Actually, I should stand on ceremony.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:58.720
What's wrong?

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.100
How did you suddenly become so kind-hearted?

00:16:02.299 --> 00:16:02.899
Suspicious.

00:16:03.759 --> 00:16:04.700
Isn't this me...

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:06.200
turning over a new leaf?

00:16:06.379 --> 00:16:07.940
You? Turning over a new leaf?

00:16:08.139 --> 00:16:09.799
At best, it's an old geezer turning back.

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:11.059
I don't believe it.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.100
Don't believe it.

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:13.539
Won't be fooled.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:16.139
Just say if you want it or not.

00:16:16.639 --> 00:16:17.220
I want it.

00:16:18.659 --> 00:16:19.700
But I don't dare trust you.

00:16:20.679 --> 00:16:21.759
Malan Flower.

00:16:21.879 --> 00:16:22.620
Malan Flower.

00:16:23.059 --> 00:16:24.620
Wind blows, rain beats,

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:25.940
it is not afraid.

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.320
Hardworking people are speaking.

00:16:29.559 --> 00:16:30.899
Please immediately

00:16:31.039 --> 00:16:32.559
bloom.

00:16:33.299 --> 00:16:34.600
Magic Bean.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:35.720
Magic Bean.

00:16:36.519 --> 00:16:37.860
Please tell me.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.120
Is your owner a big liar?

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.500
The Magic Bean didn't say yes.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.860
Silence implies consent.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:45.019
Take it back.

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:56.620
I really envy Professor Fan's love life.

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.019
It's so pure.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.039
Was it Freud or Jung who said...

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:02.379
between men and women,

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.039
there are no pure feelings?

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:05.640
You said it.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:06.980
Everyone has a motive.

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:07.740
Like, for instance,

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:09.099
just to get a mobile phone.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.720
I hate Freud the most.

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.559
Does accepting a phone make love impure?

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:14.799
Professor Fan.

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:16.099
You're just in time.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.220
They are discussing whether...

00:17:18.279 --> 00:17:19.839
there is pure love between men and women.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:20.859
Of course there is.

00:17:21.039 --> 00:17:21.660
See?

00:17:21.759 --> 00:17:23.579
Professor Fan supports my view.

00:17:24.299 --> 00:17:24.799
Professor Fan,

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.059
have you...

00:17:26.299 --> 00:17:27.299
ever been in love?

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:28.859
Of course.

00:17:29.319 --> 00:17:30.660
Do you think we scholars...

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.160
are above worldly desires?

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:33.660
Then tell us,

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.700
what is pure love?

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.579
We can treat this as a topic...

00:17:38.039 --> 00:17:39.039
to explore together.

00:17:42.539 --> 00:17:44.039
So-called pure love...

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.440
is not driven by utility.

00:17:46.819 --> 00:17:47.900
Even if the other person...

00:17:48.039 --> 00:17:49.500
has no money, no degree,

00:17:49.839 --> 00:17:50.779
no social status,

00:17:50.779 --> 00:17:51.759
no family background,

00:17:51.859 --> 00:17:52.900
isn't good-looking,

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.039
and has a bad temper,

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.299
but you still love her devotedly.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.640
Isn't that sick?

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.119
Or otherwise just stupid.

00:17:59.299 --> 00:18:00.460
That's why they say,

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.259
people in love have zero IQ.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:04.960
Not talking about you.

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:07.500
Xiaoxin still has her IQ.

00:18:07.779 --> 00:18:09.099
Otherwise, where did the phone come from?

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.000
Why do you guys keep staring...

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.359
at my phone?

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:13.200
Isn't it just because...

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.859
he didn't give them one each?

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:15.920
Classmates,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.220
I believe Xiaoxin...

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.400
wouldn't love someone just for a phone.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:21.640
It must be for feelings.

00:18:22.519 --> 00:18:24.819
Girls never say it's for money.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.640
They call rich men "successful."

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.559
And there's nothing wrong with that.

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.500
Take our Professor Fan for example.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.900
If he weren't a professor,

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.380
would Ms. Liu like him?

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:35.859
You all...

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.660
can tell Ms. Liu likes me?

00:18:38.279 --> 00:18:39.039
That?

00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:40.480
Everyone on Earth knows that.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:41.720
However,

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:45.019
Ms. Liu doesn't seem to dislike Boss Li either.

00:18:45.559 --> 00:18:46.500
So...

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:47.380
so who do you think...

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.319
she likes a bit more?

00:18:50.579 --> 00:18:52.359
Definitely Boss Li. Professor Fan.

00:18:54.319 --> 00:18:55.079
I think...

00:18:55.519 --> 00:18:56.640
between you and Boss Li,

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.220
it's neck and neck.

00:18:58.279 --> 00:18:59.079
It's fifty-fifty.

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.519
It depends on who can make the final push.

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:05.660
So...

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:06.720
so what do you think...

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.579
is the final push?

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.200
The Love Magic Bean!

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:20.680
The final push.

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:22.140
The final push.

00:19:37.519 --> 00:19:39.019
Keep your hands off

00:19:39.119 --> 00:19:40.920
Reach out and you'll get caught

00:19:41.059 --> 00:19:41.839
Sleepwalking again?

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:43.640
No, no

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.319
No

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:44.859
That's not it

00:19:45.019 --> 00:19:47.160
I wanted to make you a cup of tea

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:48.980
Why make me tea in the middle of the night?

00:19:49.359 --> 00:19:50.400
Haven't you heard?

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.259
A cup of strong, fragrant tea at midnight...

00:19:53.259 --> 00:19:54.960
Helps improve sleep quality

00:19:55.019 --> 00:19:55.720
Never heard of it

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:56.720
Speak

00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.779
Are you trying to sabotage me again?

00:20:00.319 --> 00:20:01.420
How could that be?

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.039
You've wrapped it up like this

00:20:03.039 --> 00:20:04.539
I couldn't mess with it even if I wanted to

00:20:05.019 --> 00:20:05.940
As the saying goes

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:07.079
I don't fear a thief stealing

00:20:07.339 --> 00:20:08.319
I fear a thief plotting

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:09.880
With someone like you

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:11.259
I have to be on my guard

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:13.779
What is this?

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.240
You're trying to destroy my bean!

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:17.740
No

00:20:18.119 --> 00:20:19.640
No

00:20:19.819 --> 00:20:20.720
Whether you did or not

00:20:20.779 --> 00:20:21.660
It doesn't matter anymore

00:20:22.359 --> 00:20:23.119
You've lost your chance

00:20:23.599 --> 00:20:24.119
Look

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.319
It's sprouted leaves

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:29.819
Can you make out a word?

00:20:30.059 --> 00:20:31.460
Vaguely

00:20:32.819 --> 00:20:33.779
It looks like...

00:20:33.859 --> 00:20:35.380
I can make out the word "Love"

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.980
We'll see clearly when it fully grows tomorrow

00:20:39.079 --> 00:20:40.539
It really is "Love"

00:20:45.519 --> 00:20:46.140
Darn it

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:48.180
It's completely over

00:20:48.799 --> 00:20:50.039
This final push...

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.099
How did he manage to score?

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:53.460
Professor Fan

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:54.920
Don't be too sad

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.619
Early wins are just paper

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.680
Later wins are real money

00:20:57.819 --> 00:20:59.160
Getting fat early doesn't count

00:20:59.259 --> 00:21:00.440
Getting fat later breaks the bed

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.220
You...

00:21:01.279 --> 00:21:02.980
You never know

00:21:03.119 --> 00:21:04.259
Ms. Liu might...

00:21:04.319 --> 00:21:06.059
spend time with Boss Li and realize

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:06.920
they're not a good match

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:08.220
and come back to you

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.099
Yeah

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.920
True love comes after trial and error

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:13.180
But what if after trying...

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:14.819
she realizes he actually is her true love?

00:21:15.799 --> 00:21:17.660
Then just keep waiting

00:21:17.759 --> 00:21:19.200
Haven't you heard the saying?

00:21:19.259 --> 00:21:20.799
The seven-year itch

00:21:21.019 --> 00:21:22.980
Once seven years are up...

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.940
If after seven years...

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:28.240
they're still doing well...

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.160
Then...

00:21:31.119 --> 00:21:32.579
wait for the eight-year ache

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:33.799
the nine-year suffering

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:34.980
the ten-year pain

00:21:35.579 --> 00:21:36.880
Anyway, there's bound to be a chance

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.079
And if after ten years...

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:41.079
they're still going strong...

00:21:42.099 --> 00:21:43.819
then you're completely screwed

00:21:44.599 --> 00:21:45.539
Then you...

00:21:45.839 --> 00:21:46.980
should just hurry up...

00:21:47.259 --> 00:21:48.059
and promptly...

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.180
find someone else

00:21:50.099 --> 00:21:51.359
In ten years...

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.579
what's the hurry then?

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:55.000
How old will I be by then?

00:21:55.359 --> 00:21:56.079
Find someone else?

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:57.980
Then...

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.299
what do you plan to do?

00:22:01.579 --> 00:22:03.259
What is there to do?

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:05.220
Kids...

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.640
at our age...

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:08.980
even if we fall in love...

00:22:09.319 --> 00:22:09.960
do you really think...

00:22:10.559 --> 00:22:12.319
it can be like it is for you young people?

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.279
It's nothing more than...

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.319
her glancing at me one extra time

00:22:19.599 --> 00:22:20.839
spending a little more time with me

00:22:22.759 --> 00:22:24.039
saying a few more words to me

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:26.279
and my heart...

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:27.500
just feels warm

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.779
I can be happy all night

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:31.720
and savor it for days

00:22:34.319 --> 00:22:35.319
That's all there is to it

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:36.759
The sunset is glowing

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.599
Boss Li's bean

00:22:45.799 --> 00:22:49.220
The first character is already very clear.

00:22:49.279 --> 00:22:50.319
It's the word "Love".

00:22:52.599 --> 00:22:53.799
It seems...

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.900
there are five words in total.

00:22:56.019 --> 00:22:57.920
It must be "Love is worth more."

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.140
It shows that I am a...

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:00.420
person who values love highly,

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:01.539
someone worth trusting.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.220
This last character...

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:05.200
is "Win".

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.660
"No pain, no gain."

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:08.759
Hurry and check...

00:23:08.759 --> 00:23:09.519
what bean I have.

00:23:10.279 --> 00:23:11.660
Four words in total.

00:23:11.839 --> 00:23:13.960
The first word is "Intertwined".

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.099
I made it out.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:17.799
"Intertwined branches, shared home."

00:23:18.599 --> 00:23:19.380
What does that mean?

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:20.880
It's "Intertwined branches, shared tomb."

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:21.539
It describes...

00:23:21.619 --> 00:23:22.880
steadfast love.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.839
That means my love is very steadfast.

00:23:29.259 --> 00:23:30.220
Thank you.

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:31.960
Thank you, children.

00:23:32.359 --> 00:23:33.059
Of course,

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.119
thank you two as well.

00:23:35.819 --> 00:23:37.359
For taking care of my Magic Bean.

00:23:37.519 --> 00:23:38.460
Ms. Liu,

00:23:38.579 --> 00:23:40.259
between these two pots of Magic Beans,

00:23:40.519 --> 00:23:42.180
which one do you prefer?

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:43.599
Which pot do you like?

00:23:43.599 --> 00:23:44.900
Say it, don't be shy.

00:23:45.019 --> 00:23:46.259
Don't be shy.

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:49.279
I like them both.

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:50.359
Like them both?

00:23:50.779 --> 00:23:53.200
Because you are all my forever...

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:54.559
best friends.
