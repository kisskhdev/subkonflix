00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.860
Both of them worked as salesgirls
in an apparel shop?

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:54.140
Mr. Pei,

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:55.230
you're planning to pay them

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:56.950
10,000 yuan a month,

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:58.140
along with a four-month bonus

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.140
as well as comprehensive accident
and medical insurance?

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:02.900
Any problem with that?

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.660
You're hiring salesgirls
as receptionists?

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:07.710
You see.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:10.190
Working in sales involves
a lot of communication,

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:12.260
so they would make good receptionists.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:15.140
What about

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.740
the comprehensive accident
and medical insurance?

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:19.260
Well,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.049
the receptionist's table
is badly designed.

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:22.620
It's easy to hit your toes on the edges.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.430
They're working in
a dangerous environment,

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:26.430
so we need to insure them.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:27.990
Besides,

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:29.710
in Tengda, we believe in

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.950
human equality.

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.260
Since our programmers are insured too,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:35.470
why not them?

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:39.660
Judging from the company's size,

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.190
you only need one receptionist.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:43.070
No.

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:44.900
As you can see,

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.990
they've been together
since they were conceived.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:48.950
Two hearts beating as one.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:51.620
A double blessing, isn't it?

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.070
Very symmetrical.

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:57.660
- Welcome to Tengda Game.
- Welcome to Tengda Game.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.620
- May I help you?
- May I help you?

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.610
♪Get up, get down♪

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:03.580
♪Get your feet off the ground♪

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.310
♪Get up, get down♪

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:06.270
There are so many people.

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:08.540
I'm here for the interview.

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:09.660
Covering our transportation costs?

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:10.470
Excuse me.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:11.540
Queue up!

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:13.380
I'm working here.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.950
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:16.710
I'm working here.

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:17.950
We're working here.

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:18.620
Excuse me.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:19.540
We're working here.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:21.900
Good luck.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.020
They're offering such amazing benefits,

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.140
hence the stream of interviewees.

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.260
Mr. Pei said

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.660
he welcomes even primary school leavers,
and no age limits.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:31.710
Look.

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:34.140
They're obviously here
to earn a pension.

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:34.860
That old guy.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.230
Sorry for making you wait.

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:37.310
He's even holding a teacup.

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:38.391
We've called a taxi for you.

00:11:38.391 --> 00:11:39.191
Sorry for the wait.

00:11:39.191 --> 00:11:40.140
We don't mind.

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.190
Just give us a chance.

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:42.900
Sorry, we can't hire you.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:44.710
We don't have

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:45.660
an HR department,

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.470
so Ms. Xin has to handle all of this.

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:48.470
If she didn't stop them,

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:49.310
those two old guys

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:50.820
might have been
our future colleagues.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:52.620
No way.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:55.260
I think Mr. Pei is offering
the best salary

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.020
to hire ruffians from
all over the country.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:58.230
Impossible.

00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:59.470
We're not ruffians.

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:01.140
We're hidden talents.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.380
Wait for me, hidden talent.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:11.860
Good morning.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:12.590
It's really

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:13.540
my honor to

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.070
have the opportunity for interview.

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:25.230
Niu?

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:27.660
Huang?

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:30.430
Niu.

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.900
Niu, what are you doing here?

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:34.470
Huang.

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:35.430
You see,

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:36.900
even though you've been optimized,

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.380
but this...

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:40.990
You've picked up some good habits
from our company.

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:42.660
Keep it up.

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.700
(Toilet)

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:46.230
Niu!

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:47.710
Niu!

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:51.950
Niu.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.780
Are you here for a business meeting?

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:55.990
Well,

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.740
Tengda invited me over

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.020
for a discussion...

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:01.990
Is Mr. Niu Yuanfeng here?

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:02.990
Mr. Niu Yuanfeng?

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:04.190
I'm here. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:06.540
Sorry, Mr. Niu.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.190
You didn't pass the interview screening,

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:09.990
but we will cover your costs,

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:11.780
including transportation and apparel,

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.070
provided that it's

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:14.070
a reasonable number.

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:15.260
Thank you.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:22.710
Niu.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.710
You've been optimized too?

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:28.260
No, Huang, I'm different.

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:29.540
I...

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:31.430
I quit my job.

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:32.860
Is Mr. Huang Sibo here?

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:33.540
Yes.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.740
It's your turn to be interviewed.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:36.470
Okay.

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:40.500
Niu, it's okay.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.740
You used to tell me

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.470
the failure is the mother of success.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:44.990
Let's work hard.

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.660
Niu, I need to go now.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.310
Wait.

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:50.230
So,

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:53.860
that person earlier was my former boss.

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:56.990
He has an impressive resume,
but you rejected him?

00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:59.710
What kind of person
is your company looking to hire?

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:01.990
Tengda only hires talents
that Mr. Pei admires.

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:02.740
Follow me.

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:22.780
Huang Sibo from Wanli Academy.

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:24.230
Yes, I'm Huang Sibo!

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:24.990
I will work hard!

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:26.480
If Tengda gives me
the chance to shine,

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.102
I will give my all to Tengda!

00:14:28.124 --> 00:14:29.710
I won't disappoint you!

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.500
Calm down.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:37.900
Sit down.

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:40.780
I've read your resume.

00:14:40.835 --> 00:14:41.857
In your previous company,

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.710
you've been in the same position
for six years.

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:44.249
No promotion.

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:46.230
Was there a lack of opportunity
for career advancement?

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:47.070
Is that why you quit?

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:48.740
No, I was optimized.

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:51.657
Mr. Lv, your resume states

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.230
that you have relevant experience
in the Nobel Literature Prize?

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:57.230
Yes, I am a Nobel Literature Prize
book reader.

00:14:58.946 --> 00:15:01.310
"Senior purchasing experience
in billion-dollar projects"?

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:02.430
I bought lottery tickets.

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:04.020
"A million-follower influencer"?

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.020
0.0001 million followers.

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:08.710
By the way,

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:11.230
your hiring notice says

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:12.710
you promise no overtime?

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:14.230
Weekends are always off,

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.470
and absolutely no working
on holidays, right?

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:17.860
That's a lot of promises.

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.710
Can you really do that?

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:22.230
I guarantee we'll do all that.

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:24.430
I'll consider coming, then.

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:26.710
Hello, I'm Li Yada.

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:31.780
I'm a programmer.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.190
You have a cat in the office?

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:40.070
Is your cat feed okay?

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.020
What?

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.540
What's the protein content?

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:43.740
And fat content?

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:45.990
And fiber, calcium, phosphorus,
magnesium, taurine...

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:47.430
Do they meet the requirements?

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:48.020
Well...

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.470
What about tinned cat food?

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:50.900
According to AAFCO's standards,

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.946
protein should make up
at least 10% of a cat's diet.

00:15:52.968 --> 00:15:54.540
Does your food meet the requirements?

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:55.620
Ms. Li,

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.620
are we interviewing you now,

00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:58.880
or are you interviewing the cat?

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:00.470
Both can do.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:05.430
You're telling me you got fired?

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:06.190
Sorry,

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:07.710
I know I can't say that in an interview.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:08.710
I'm too nervous.

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:09.900
Let's do this again.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:10.860
Wait!

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.660
Huang Sibo from Wanli Academy.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.710
Since you're an honest man,

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:19.230
you

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:20.900
are hired.

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:26.990
So, you care about
having days off, right?

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:28.660
You're hired.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:33.540
(Li Yada.)

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:35.470
You're hired.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.190
Kitty!

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:42.470
Hao Qiong.

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:43.310
Your resume says

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:45.260
you've been interviewed by 10 companies,

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:46.710
but none of them hired you?

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:47.710
Why?

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:49.380
I don't know.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:51.470
This doesn't make sense.

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:53.900
Your resume looks okay,
and so are your qualifications.

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:55.620
What could the reason be?

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.620
I've never thought about it.

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:00.710
What did you call her?

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:02.470
Hao Qiong. It's written here.

00:17:02.502 --> 00:17:05.230
Her name is Hao Qiong (so poor),
but she wants to work in finance.

00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:11.950
This is so unfair.

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:13.190
You

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:15.150
are hired.

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:19.190
Mr. Pei, aren't you being too impulsive?

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.670
How so?

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:23.390
Look at their resumes.

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.710
"Intern at a language academy".

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:27.670
That means he used to be
a Mandarin teacher.

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:30.950
Look, Huang Sibo
never got promoted in six years.

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:31.950
What does this show?

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:33.870
Sorry about that.

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:34.780
Don't be sorry.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.780
This shows that you

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:40.710
can accept mediocrity
while staying true to yourself.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:42.710
You're a perfect fit for this position.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.710
What position are you interested in?

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:47.190
Product Manager?

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:49.500
Name your salary.

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:52.190
8,000.

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.780
8,000?

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:53.710
6,000 works, too.

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:55.710
6,000, seriously?

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:59.060
You see, renting a room in Jinchuan

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:00.710
costs around 5,000 yuan a month, right?

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:02.124
If you take a taxi to work every day,

00:18:02.146 --> 00:18:03.670
that'd be at least 1,500 yuan a month.

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:06.150
Your daily expenses,
let's say it's 3,000 yuan.

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:07.430
That still doesn't include

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:08.710
work gatherings,

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:09.910
team building costs and all.

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:12.230
That alone would've been 5,000 yuan.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.630
Besides, as an employee,

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.190
you need to have savings.

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:18.870
I'm offering you 35,000.

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:19.950
What?

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:21.300
Too little?

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:22.950
Mr. Pei.

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:25.870
You're testing our limits.

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:27.710
How?

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.710
You see, he has six years
of work experience.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:32.260
I'm paying him 35,000 a month.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:33.060
It's a great deal.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:34.260
Sorry to interrupt.

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:36.540
This might sound rude,

00:18:36.635 --> 00:18:37.880
but is this a legal company?

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.280
Are you going to make me pay
before I can work here?

00:18:40.324 --> 00:18:41.260
We are a legal company,

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.820
and you don't have to pay us anything.

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:43.430
I'm telling you,

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:44.870
there's no probation period here.

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:47.070
Once you sign the contract,
you're a permanent employee.

00:18:47.191 --> 00:18:48.580
By the way, we will also cover

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:49.470
your taxi fare today.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:51.150
I took the metro.

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:51.710
See?

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:53.060
For a 40-year-old man,

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:53.990
he's a...

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:55.470
28.

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:56.780
It's on my resume.

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:02.300
(Huang Sibo, 28 years old)

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:06.260
My previous job was pretty taxing.

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:08.990
Well,

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:10.230
young man.

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:11.990
Such innocence

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.990
and quality.

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:14.540
We need to reward him.

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:15.670
So,

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:18.150
let's pay for

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:19.470
his apparel today.

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:20.670
That's settled.

00:19:28.368 --> 00:19:29.813
(You have just received 5,000 yuan
in your bank account.)

00:19:29.813 --> 00:19:31.670
No wonder they insisted on
giving me a base salary.

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:33.740
The contract was so long.
It was literally 1GB.

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:36.430
There's no way I can find a loophole.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.910
Qian.

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:43.990
(Pillar of the Company)

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:45.190
These people you hired

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:46.990
are literally leftovers
from other companies.

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:49.230
Like the product manager, Huang Sibo.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.190
It's obvious he got fired
from his previous job.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:52.500
Then there's Lv Mingliang,

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:53.500
the programmer.

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.430
He's more of an abstractist.

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:56.568
He claims to have graduated

00:19:56.591 --> 00:19:58.430
from both Tsinghua
and Peking University.

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.430
He's worked 28 jobs in a year,

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:01.740
none lasting over a week.

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.589
One of his jobs was
"supermarket food tester".

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:05.546
He's just eating food samples
at the supermarket.

00:20:05.546 --> 00:20:06.470
That's all.

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:07.300
Who are these people?

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.540
Do you still remember your resume?

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:12.150
I don't have a resume.

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:16.710
Take a good look at them.

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:18.260
Actually, all of them

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.740
are hidden talents shelved away
by their previous companies.

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:22.260
Like him.

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:23.670
Lv Mingliang.

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:24.950
Lv.

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.740
He managed to come up

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:27.990
with an impressive resume,

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:29.924
but he never lasted long
in any of his jobs.

00:20:29.924 --> 00:20:31.230
You know why?

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.710
Because he lacks determination.

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:33.710
Nonsense.

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:35.500
Don't blame the youngsters.

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:36.500
Ma.

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.060
As a business,
what's the most important thing?

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:39.910
Making money.

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:42.540
As a business, the most important thing

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:45.780
is to guide the lost youths.

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:47.990
Explore their interests.

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:49.780
Make their talents shine.

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.230
So that's how you understand it.

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:53.710
Look at him.

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:56.190
Huang Sibo.

00:20:56.568 --> 00:20:58.257
Do you know why he never got promoted

00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:59.230
after so many years?

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:00.020
Why?

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:01.950
Because of jealousy.

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:02.870
Jealousy?

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:03.740
That's why

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.190
we need to create

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:07.124
a fair, transparent environment
for competition

00:21:07.146 --> 00:21:09.020
so that these unfulfilled youths

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.670
can shine brightly in our company!

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:14.990
Finally, let's look at
Hao Qiong from Finance.

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:16.020
She couldn't find a job.

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:17.910
Is it because she lacks qualifications?

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:18.780
Of course not.

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:19.990
It's because other companies

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:21.470
think her name is unlucky.

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:23.990
This is workplace bullying, isn't it?

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:25.300
This is outrageous!

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:26.300
Will we be like them?

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:27.150
Of course not!

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:28.230
What should we do, then?

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:29.670
Hire her!

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:31.230
Qian.

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:32.990
You're a visionary.

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:35.230
I can learn so much from you.

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:37.260
Actually, I've learned
a lot from you too.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.540
Learn, my foot!
You idiots talk too much!

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:40.500
Pipe down!

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:42.230
Sorry.

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:42.910
Next up,

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:44.630
you need to help the new recruits

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.990
adapt.

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:45.950
Of course.

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.950
Okay.

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:50.190
Huang Sibo.

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:51.260
Lv Mingliang.

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:52.500
Hao Qiong.

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:55.710
A golden team.

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:06.980
(Tengda CAM)

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:11.980
(Tengda Game)

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:23.860
(Tengda Game)

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:32.740
Hello.

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:33.710
Huang Sibo,

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:34.740
product manager.

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.150
Lv Mingliang, programmer.

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:39.470
I reckon we'll be
contacting each other often,

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:41.500
but keep it minimal.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:42.540
Better yet, none.

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.060
That would mean we have less work.

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.710
We'll still be colleagues.

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:49.630
Colleagues?

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.630
How much is your salary?

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:55.060
I think that's confidential.

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:56.300
How so? (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:58.060
Mr. Pei mentioned

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:00.500
that Tengda's payroll is transparent.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:01.710
If anyone feels unhappy

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:03.870
because they earn less
than their colleagues,

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:05.740
they can ask for a raise.

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:06.870
Really?

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:11.870
That's Ma Yang, the Vice CEO.

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:13.300
Instead of having his own office,

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.230
he's sitting with us.

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:17.500
(One with the People)

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.470
He only earns 10,000 a month.

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:22.020
That girl.

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.060
Hao Qiong from Finance.

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:23.950
What's her name again?

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:25.500
Hao Qiong.

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:27.630
She's never entered college,

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:30.020
and she's earning 18,000 a month.

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:33.500
Those two from Design.

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:35.960
One can't tell red and green apart,
and the other, blue and yellow.

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:37.990
Hey, your shirt looks cool.

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:39.260
Where did you buy it?

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:40.870
I love your blue shirt.

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:41.990
Wait, pal.

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:43.710
This shirt is green.

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:44.710
What's wrong with you?

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:45.260
Green?

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:49.390
They're earning this much.

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:50.230
What?

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:54.740
That's Yun from HR.

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:56.990
She was a housewife

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:59.230
who hadn't worked for the past 20 years.

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:00.780
That girl is Li Yada.

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:02.260
Another programmer.

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:05.870
Why is the company

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:09.020
hiring these people?

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:10.390
My guess is,

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:12.470
Mr. Pei is most likely

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:14.390
a rich kid who's never worked
a day in his life.

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:17.710
Tengda's probably going bankrupt soon.

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:19.710
No.

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:22.470
It wasn't easy for me to get this job.

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:24.390
Then, make use of
the company's resources

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:25.540
while you're still here.

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:26.260
What are you doing?

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:27.300
What are you thinking?

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:28.630
Mr. Pei is here!

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:33.470
Why has everyone gone quiet?

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:35.260
Don't mute yourselves

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:36.300
just because I'm here.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.710
In Tengda, we encourage small talk

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:40.260
and ban leaders from big talk.

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:41.500
You are allowed to gossip

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:42.710
during meetings.

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.230
Actually, I didn't want

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:46.260
to waste everyone's time
with this meeting,

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.100
but our values in Tengda

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.470
are very different
from other companies,

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:53.300
so I wanted to explain first.

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:56.630
First.

00:24:57.390 --> 00:24:58.990
Employees must use the company's

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:01.060
gym and entertainment facilities

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:02.300
for at least four hours a week

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.990
to maintain physical and mental health.

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:07.230
- Gym at work!
- Gym at work!

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.950
Second.

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:12.020
The first day you return to work
after a weekend or holiday,

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.430
you may decide
what time to come to work.

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:16.470
No more return-to-work blues.

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:20.230
1:30 pm is still too early?

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:22.470
Third.

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:25.950
The most important rule.

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:27.502
Working overtime is strictly prohibited.

00:25:27.524 --> 00:25:28.524
As for holidays,

00:25:28.524 --> 00:25:30.230
we implement
a consecutive holiday system.

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:33.540
If a public holiday falls on a weekend,
it will be replaced on weekdays.

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:36.020
Work days are not replaced.

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:38.150
Lv.

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:40.390
We have nine days off
thanks to National Day.

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:42.390
I still can't get used to this.

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:43.710
I still have unfinished work,

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:45.740
so I'm secretly working overtime
in the office.

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:47.740
You can continue after the holidays.

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:52.035
Huang Sibo, you're back.

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:54.990
Working outside of working hours
is strictly prohibited.

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:57.870
Do not work after work hours.

00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:59.657
Do not talk to your colleagues
about work

00:25:59.657 --> 00:26:02.500
outside of working hours.

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:09.430
Other rules

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:11.100
are listed down in the Employee Handbook

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.990
and sent to your email.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:14.230
Today is Friday,

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:15.670
so I won't be assigning any work.

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:17.190
You may read the Employee Handbook,

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:19.280
or have a change of pace
at the Entertainment Room

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.820
to get some inspiration for projects.

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:21.670
Dismissed.

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:24.470
That's it?

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:25.710
That's all?

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.670
The Employee Handbook says

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:30.780
Tengda employees

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.230
can make full use
of the company's resources.

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:35.390
If we feel tired,

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:37.470
we can talk to our department head.

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:38.670
The company will immediately

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:40.670
hire new recruits
to lighten our workload.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.910
Does this company exist for real?

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:45.870
Tengda must be in deep trouble.

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:47.740
Why think so much?

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:49.470
It's an easy job, anyway.

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:51.630
Just cruising through the day.

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:53.780
We can talk about the future later.

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:00.990
I need to start
submitting resumes again.

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:32.990
Mr. Pei, I'm going home.

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:35.390
Look at Lv.

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:42.580
He's a role model.

00:27:42.902 --> 00:27:43.950
It's time to get off work.

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:45.820
Why are you still here?

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:48.302
Not only do you need
to get off work with gusto,

00:27:48.346 --> 00:27:50.500
but you also need
to learn that work-life balance

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.100
and sufficient rest

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:54.260
are crucial to work efficiency.

00:27:58.340 --> 00:27:59.100
Bao Xu.

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:00.060
Why are you playing

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:01.340
such an old game?

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:03.340
Old games are soulful.

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:04.630
I play this, too.

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:09.470
Bao.

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:11.540
Your game ID is...

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.580
B... B517?

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:16.150
You're the No. 1 player
of Strongest of Kings?

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:19.470
Bao Xu

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:21.500
is our official game tester.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.020
He's here for real.

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.430
He's a god-tier player

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:25.870
in every MMORPG out there.

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:26.950
He's cleared

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:28.340
every single PC game ever made.

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:30.020
If there's a game you need help with,

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.100
look for him.

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:31.910
Really?

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:34.950
Bao, look at this.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:37.630
(Game Over)

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:44.430
Mr. Pei, I haven't gotten
past this level yet.

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:45.260
Don't worry, though.

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:46.780
I'll work overtime
to clear this level.

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:48.559
I know you talked about it
in the meeting,

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.270
but I know very well
that I'll do a good job.

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:51.950
I won't disappoint you!

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:55.430
Sibo.

00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:58.430
Your previous company's
bad overtime culture

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:00.390
must have rubbed off on you.

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:01.780
Remember this.

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:04.740
Overtime is strictly prohibited here.

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:05.390
Everyone!

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:06.470
Get off work!

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:11.500
That's it? Work's over?

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:13.780
I didn't do anything today.

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:15.430
You're too competitive.

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:16.910
You must have worked in Fuhui.

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:18.780
That's right.

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:20.780
I knew it, you reek of that place.

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:22.470
They love training work machines.

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:24.340
How do I keep my job, then?

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:26.390
You know, I was jobless for a year
after graduation.

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:28.990
When I finally landed a job,
they set up this optimization criterion.

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:31.340
I got to stay
because I agreed to work overtime

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:33.390
with no pay raises,
but they still fired me.

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:36.260
I can't lose my job again.

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:42.990
Bao.

00:29:43.546 --> 00:29:44.630
Are you working overtime?

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:46.470
No, I'm playing games.

00:29:46.724 --> 00:29:48.500
The Internet connection here is great.

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:02.620
(Shenhua International)

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:19.060
(Achilles and Pandora,
together with Heracles, Athena...)

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:20.190
Ma Yang?

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:22.870
What the heck? You scared me.

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:25.870
Ma Yang, I have a question.

00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:27.580
Why was "The Lonely Road"

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:29.910
such a huge success?

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:30.990
The Lonely Road?

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:33.100
Because gamers are rebellious.

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:34.390
They enjoy torturing themselves.

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:37.990
If we follow this train of thought,

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:39.470
what should we do next?

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:41.580
Make more sequels.

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:42.740
The Lonely Route.

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:43.630
The Lonely Highway.

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:45.870
Wrong.
If we follow this train of thought,

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:48.300
we should make a card game next.

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:49.300
Card games...

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:50.740
What dumb idea is that?

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:52.630
Bao said that card games are outdated.

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:53.950
As you just said,

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:55.990
gamers are rebellious nowadays.

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:57.390
So, we're going to make a game

00:30:57.390 --> 00:30:58.990
with no in-app purchases.

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:01.190
10 yuan for a lifetime pass.

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:03.430
Everyone gets
100 free card draws every day.

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:04.340
Well?

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:06.780
I'm even more confused.

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:07.990
Why charge 10 yuan?

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:09.820
You might as well make it free.

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:11.680
Who the heck
would make a card game like that?

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:12.857
You think I didn't want that?

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.500
Ms. Xin refused my idea.

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:15.470
Ma Yang.

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:18.060
Are you questioning my decision?

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.780
Of course not.

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:22.470
It was you who made "The Lonely Road".

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:23.990
That's why I will support

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:25.430
your decision.

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:27.190
Ma Yang.

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:31.430
I want you to spearhead
the development team for this project.

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:33.100
Me?

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:34.390
Me?

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.950
Mr. Pei. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:38.100
I know

00:31:38.168 --> 00:31:39.390
that many people are doubting

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:40.990
my ability to be the Vice CEO.

00:31:42.257 --> 00:31:44.260
They say I probably saved you
from an atomic bomb.

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:45.540
Don't worry, though.

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:47.060
After this battle,

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:48.540
I will make other people see

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:50.340
what you saw in me.

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:52.470
Good!

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:53.390
Mr. Pei.

00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:55.430
What kind of game concept
do you have in mind?

00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:59.390
(Stories of Ancient Grease)
Ancient... Grease.

00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:01.302
A typo on the cover?
It must be a pirated copy.

00:32:01.324 --> 00:32:02.190
Mythology.

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:03.190
Mythology?

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:06.390
Great minds think alike.

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:09.470
Mr. Pei. I told you I was going
to read a book, right?

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:09.990
Yes.

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:11.100
I couldn't read any.

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:13.950
But I downloaded a book

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:15.020
about Greek mythology.

00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:15.740
A web novel?

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:16.300
Yes.

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.500
There's a lot of material inside

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:19.950
we can use in the game.

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:20.870
Look.

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:22.500
There's this guy called Achilles.

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:23.580
Achilles?

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:24.470
I'm telling you.

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:26.260
This Achilles guy

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:28.020
has a box.

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:29.630
The gods told him not to open it.

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:30.235
Never open it.

00:32:30.235 --> 00:32:31.060
But he did.

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:33.260
And then the world turned chaotic.

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:35.470
Ma Yang, do you know about Pandora?

00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:36.190
Pandora?

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:37.540
She appeared later in the story.

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:40.260
She's a heroine

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:42.260
clad in golden armor.

00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:43.990
But she has a fatal weakness.

00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:44.540
What is it?

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:45.740
Her heel.

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:47.260
Just pull her ankle,

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:48.470
and she's dead.

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:49.820
Ma Yang.

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:51.950
Did you write this book?

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:53.470
I can't write books.

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:56.020
I'm saying we can use these
Ancient Greek characters

00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:57.470
as heroes in our game.

00:32:58.457 --> 00:32:59.340
We can turn Pandora

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:01.300
into a dragon-slaying lolita.

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:02.670
She can carry a 40-meter blade.

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:03.740
Have scars on her face.

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:05.340
As for Achilles,

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.340
we can turn him
into a mechanical puppet.

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:08.540
His weapon would be a box.

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:10.740
There's also this character
in the story, the god of sun.

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:11.820
His name is...

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:13.190
His name is

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:14.580
Apineapple.

00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:16.020
We can turn him

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:17.630
into a retro pixel character.

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:19.470
What do you think?

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:20.990
These ideas are golden, right?

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:24.020
Ma Yang, I knew
I found the right person.

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:26.470
You're a genius!

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:28.260
What a bizarre game.

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:29.150

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:30.391
