[Born to Be Alive]

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.140
[Episode 36]

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.259
If he doesn't like them,

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:45.009
why bother?

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.930
It's still a token

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:46.930
of our regard.

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.160
These hardcover
Four Great Classical Novels

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.630
can't be bought abroad.

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:56.800
I'm going out for a bit.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.810
If you drink,

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.880
remember to call me to pick you up.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.370
I won't drink.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.370
I'll be back soon.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.250
The chemical plant owner

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.510
has been taken care of.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.890
Don't worry.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:53.990
He won't talk.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.570
Good.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.750
You really have a way with things.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.610
That diversionary tactic

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.380
worked perfectly.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.980
Small cost, great results.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.000
The inspection team didn't come in vain,

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.720
and they can report back successfully.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.540
Those apartments of mine in the south,

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.870
sell them immediately.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.460
Forget the price.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.290
Sell to anyone who's buying.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.680
Transfer all the money

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.950
to Jianshe.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.930
What do you mean by this?

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:27.930
It's time to pull back.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.640
We can't spread ourselves too thin.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.100
This time,

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.430
we managed to deal with

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.630
the inspection team.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.300
But if

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:39.380
they suddenly

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.640
come back for a review,

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.340
we'll be caught

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.329
off guard again.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.600
It's a blind spot.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.090
Now is exactly the time

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.200
to forge ahead.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.079
We should quit while we're ahead.

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:52.910
After all these years,

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.130
we've made enough.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.840
Let's quit while the going is good.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.570
I can't quit.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.690
At the mines right now,

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:04.880
there are still 400,000 tons

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.280
of outcrop coal piled up.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.440
It's worth at least 200 million.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.600
If we stop now,

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.240
we're throwing that 200 million away.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.630
And at Mine No. 2,

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:15.550
the proven reserves

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.010
are still 10 million tons.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.839
I'm not leaving until I've mined it all.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.850
So,

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:23.510
Lin,

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.220
give me 2 more years.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.220
Just 2 years.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.480
Within 2 years,

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.330
I'll make a big show
of the regreening efforts

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.420
to cooperate with you.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.820
Whoever comes to inspect or interview,

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:33.670
there will be no problem.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.000
I'll shut them all up.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.610
But you have to let me finish mining.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.110
Impossible.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.690
Where are you going?

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.290
Impossible!

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.730
I'm retiring next year.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.200
I want a safe landing!

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.280
Do you understand?

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.580
Let me tell you, Feng Keqing.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.670
If you can't cooperate with me,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.570
I can't protect you.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.180
You protect me?

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:05.390
Lin.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.350
I'm the one protecting you.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.350
Are you crazy?

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:15.910
What do you mean?

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:21.600
Now you want

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:22.970
to just walk away?

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.790
It's too late.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.659
Mrs. Lin,

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.640
I'm here to mooch a meal again.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.909
I feel quite bad about it,

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:51.100
so I brought a small gift.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.740
Look at you,

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.180
you're always so polite.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.280
Come on in.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.980
Lin is home.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.659
Let me do it.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:57.700
Go have tea with Lin.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:58.790
You haven't seen him in a while.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:59.340
Go on.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.270
Lin.

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.080
This wine,

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.150
I have to say,

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.060
is actually quite good.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.920
Come, sit down.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.650
Feng.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.190
It's all thanks to you

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.870
that Jianshe got to go abroad.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.600
He's adapting well over there.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:19.780
He said there are

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.510
many Chinese people at school.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.840
I have many friends abroad.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.240
It's no trouble at all.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.600
In a while,

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.530
won't the grandparents

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:28.710
want to go visit him?

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.860
When the time comes,

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.530
I'll accompany them to get their visas.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:33.850
Thank you. Thank you.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.000
This time,

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.420
I also brought you

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.330
a small gift.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.550
How many times have I told you

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:40.470
not to bring gifts?

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:41.930
You just...

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.210
A gold nugget.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.250
A friend dug it up in Xinjiang.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:02.800
My friends and I

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:03.330
registered a mining company

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:04.740
over there.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.750
It's a legitimate enterprise

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:07.880
with mining rights.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:09.390
Next,

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.160
aren't we going

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.480
to develop Bolamula?

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.360
Regarding the gold mining permit,

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.420
when the time comes,

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.160
can you give us

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.620
priority consideration?

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.600
What makes you think

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.270
that development must be

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:31.980
destructive?

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.580
When these mining companies

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:34.130
finish stripping the mine

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:35.240
and skip town,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.930
what's left won't be wetlands—

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.250
it'll just be a dead zone!

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:38.920
Those in favor of submitting

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.680
the nature reserve application report,

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.080
please raise your hands.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:46.070
I believe

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:47.430
we should not

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:48.760
make this decision now.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.810
On this trip to Beijing,

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.750
besides giving lectures at universities,

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:54.450
I'll meet with

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:55.500
leaders and experts

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.130
from the Ministry of Forestry.

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:58.210
I'll ask them for feedback

00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:58.980
on my report.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:02.150
We've waited 3 years.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.540
We can also wait

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:06.710
another month or two.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:07.830
Duojie and the Mountain Patrol

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.550
are getting a lot of attention.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:11.550
The publicity is gaining momentum.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.340
The county government

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:15.950
is increasingly in favor

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:17.810
of establishing the reserve.

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:20.840
I'm afraid there's very little

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:25.770
I can do about this matter now.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.600
Actually, some of the things

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.690
the Mountain Patrol does

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.240
aren't exactly by the book.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.600
Sometimes, letters from the public

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.700
come in handy.

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:42.679
Don't you think?

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:53.920
Feng.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.150
Actually, you can

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.660
find Deputy County Mayor Duo,

00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.670
have a private chat,

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.000
and try to persuade him.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:02.720
Perhaps—

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.320
I know.

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:05.900
I'll talk to him too.

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:51.390
I've stalled him for a few days.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.470
After he comes back
and submits the report,

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:54.460
establishing the reserve

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.660
might be inevitable.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:57.150
You can

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:58.260
take the time to talk to him

00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:59.240
when he returns.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:09.890
This message

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.270
was sent 17 years ago.

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:14.850
You must have forgotten.

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:17.390
I've already sent

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:19.120
the flight information to you.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:19.840
When are you planning

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.640
to talk to him?

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.530
I'm already waiting for him
at the airport.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.460
You move fast.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.210
Why the rush?

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:29.790
After he returns,

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:31.410
he has to deal with team matters.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:32.550
I doubt he's in the mood to talk to you—

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:33.550
County Mayor Lin,

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:35.730
the Qima'er Gold Mine

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:37.210
is actually mine.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:42.940
Feng.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.260
Feng, listen to me.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:44.960
Duojie responds to kindness,

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.940
not force.

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:47.500
If you really can't reach an agreement,

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:48.360
you can't force it.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.090
Don't worry, County Mayor Lin.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:51.030
This time,

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:53.620
we will reach an agreement.

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:54.860
What do you mean?

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:56.780
What do you mean?

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:58.720
If we can't,

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.050
he won't need to go back to Mazhi.

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:02.450
What are you trying to do?

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.720
What are you trying to do?

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.370
Lin.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:49.260
All these years,

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.740
Jianshe going abroad,

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.240
opening a company,

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.420
and buying a house,

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.580
and the elderly getting sick,

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.040
paying off those doctors—

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.640
these didn't cost a fortune,

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.760
but they weren't cheap either.

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:05.830
If you don't help now,

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:07.780
it wouldn't be fair.

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:13.320
Fair?

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:16.890
Back then,

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.910
as to the approval
for the Duolong Mountain Gold Mine,

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:21.050
it was Huang in the province

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:22.310
who stamped it for you.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.810
From Mazhi to Tianduo,

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:25.860
from a small mine

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:27.510
to 7 large ones,

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.690
from coal mine integration

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:34.510
to the mining ban and regreening,

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:36.250
tell me, at which step

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.910
did I not push you up?

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:39.880
Is what you're doing now

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:41.800
appropriate?

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.290
Only lovers care about appropriateness.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.530
I am a business person.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.450
I only care if it's profitable.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:55.570
The strong wind

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:57.230
has already started blowing.

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:58.570
Can that Swiss fresh air system

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.440
you just installed at home

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:02.170
filter out

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.530
the coal dust

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:05.210
from 150 meters underground?

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:12.120
I'll definitely stay in Tianduo

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.250
for a few more years.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.460
The one anxious to retire

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:17.750
isn't me anyway.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.250
You can

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:22.290
go back and think about it.

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:24.730
Think carefully.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.430
As you just said,

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:48.760
for the next 2 years,

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:52.930
what is Xinhai's output?

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:54.940
Five million tons a year.

00:13:58.690 --> 00:13:59.410
Feng.

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:07.080
You're still

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:09.470
that small merchant running a restaurant.

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:10.300
After all these years,

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.830
you haven't improved a bit.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:15.260
What do you mean?

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.360
Since we're doing it,

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:20.910
why can't the operation

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:22.000
be bigger?

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:29.460
I'll reach out to my friends

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:30.390
in the province.

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:33.060
I'll have them keep an eye out for me.

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:34.820
If there's any movement,

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.690
they'll tell me in advance.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:38.940
Speed things up on your end.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.280
Once I step down next year,

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.810
I'll find a way to go abroad.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:45.050
By then,

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.840
however the sky changes here,

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:49.870
it will have nothing to do with me.

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:51.480
Understood,

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:52.790
Mayor Lin.

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:54.680
Duojie's body

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.430
still hasn't been identified.

00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:58.470
Bai Ju

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.300
will definitely not let this go.

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:02.890
As for her,

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:04.520
Meng has been watching her.

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:06.960
It's a society of law now.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:07.940
Without evidence,

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.190
as a little cop,

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:11.940
she can't do anything,
no matter how hard she tries.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:12.720
That Reporter Shao

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:13.790
is the same.

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:15.710
You don't need to worry.

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:18.150
As for the Mountain Patrol,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.130
they're just a bunch of idlers anyway.

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:23.190
If they keep investigating,

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.800
we'll just wipe them all out.

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:27.000
Don't worry.

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:29.440
It'll look like an accident

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.090
with no traces left.

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:33.170
What era is this?

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:37.070
You still want to kill and fight?

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:40.130
Do you want
to be a gangster all your life?

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:43.650
If money can solve it,

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:46.720
don't attract attention.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:48.700
Okay.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.090
I promise not to cause you trouble.

00:15:58.410 --> 00:15:59.880
Don't push me.

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:00.690
You're so strong.

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:01.490
How did you get

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:02.580
so strong?

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:06.580
What are you doing?

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:07.440
Put your hat on.

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:17.410
Go inside. Don't look back.

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:18.010
Go inside.

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:19.270
Go inside.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:39.030
Reporter Shao.

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:41.790
You really are a good father.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.180
Not really.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.010
Still learning.

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:51.650
Your kid is in fifth grade, right?

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:55.270
I heard you're trying to get her
into the provincial capital middle school.

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:56.670
I have friends there too.

00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:58.700
If you need,

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.240
I can ask around for you.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:00.890
No need.

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:04.140
Thank you, Mr. Feng.

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:07.099
I went to the provincial capital
last month

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:09.160
and had a meal with your Chief Editor.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:10.900
We even talked about you.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.589
We both think

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:13.880
it's a pity

00:17:14.109 --> 00:17:14.900
that you're not moving up.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:15.920
Nothing to pity.

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:17.420
Here, I can write reports

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:18.910
and spend time with my family.

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:19.400
It's better than

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.790
sitting in a big office.

00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:23.460
Mr. Feng, just say what you want.

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:25.109
Stop beating around the bush.

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:27.220
Xinhai is indeed mining privately.

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:30.050
Two years.

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:32.990
I'll mine for 2 more years
and then pull out.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.980
Is that direct enough?

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:39.240
What a pity.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.680
You didn't record that in time.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.240
Otherwise, it would be

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.240
strong evidence of illegal mining.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.610
What do you want?

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:47.790
One percent of the profits

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.440
from the next 2 years goes to you.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.640
Your child's schooling

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.640
and elderly care—

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:52.750
I can help you.

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:55.740
How about it?

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.930
As for Officer Bai,

00:17:57.930 --> 00:17:59.590
you find a way to persuade her.

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:01.860
Actually, sometimes, a man

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.520
should be decisive.

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:07.720
It seems that you

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.850
still don't know me,

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:11.050
and that you don't know my family.

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:13.690
The women are in charge in our family.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:15.820
I really didn't expect

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:18.490
Tianduo's top entrepreneur

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:19.840
to be like this.

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:21.250
Like what?

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.890
Carrying the banner
of economic development

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.410
while destroying the environment.

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:31.240
Overdrawing the future

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.070
to satisfy present selfish desires.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.070
Selfish desires?

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:37.440
Isn't that too narrow-minded?

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:38.940
Do you know

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.250
what this place was like

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:41.010
20 years ago?

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.200
It was slightly better than Mazhi County.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.930
But how much better could it be?

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:48.090
Tianduo's best hotel

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.070
couldn't even provide electricity all day.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.740
In winter,

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:51.980
guests had to

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.930
light their own stoves for warmth.

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:56.110
And 20 years later?

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.270
Here, we built

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:59.070
five-star hotels

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:00.820
and stadiums.

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:03.480
The herdsmen here

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:04.300
no longer

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:05.570
herd on horseback

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:06.960
like their fathers.

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:09.470
When they ride motorcycles

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:10.640
and drive cars,

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:11.980
do you think they want

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:13.200
to get back on a horse?

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:14.750
Will Zhacuo?

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:17.680
I'm sorry.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.500
It's impossible.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:21.250
This is human nature.

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:23.640
An insatiable nature.

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:25.500
A nature that allows you

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.780
to discard

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:28.410
your so-called traditions.

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:31.410
And whoever grasps this nature

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:35.010
wins the era.

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.000
Then let me tell you something.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:44.810
You can use your connections

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:45.540
to silence me

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.930
and delete my articles.

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:47.920
But don't stand here

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.680
twisting facts
and confusing right and wrong,

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:50.700
playing the savior

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.230
while poisoning this city.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.010
Economic development
and environmental protection

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:55.540
have never been opposites.

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:56.380
No matter

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.050
how sanctimonious you act,

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:01.810
your original sin

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:03.800
can't be washed away.

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:08.390
Just like that photo you took,

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:10.850
no matter how beautiful
or spectacular it is,

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:11.640
you know

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:12.770
how you took it,

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.420
so does the snow mountain.

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:16.570
Those dirty things you did

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.020
will be known sooner or later.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.620
Wonderful.

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:25.430
Well said.

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:27.960
As expected of Reporter Shao.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.620
No wonder you can write so many

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:30.790
brilliant reports.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:36.640
As far as I know,

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:38.660
Officer Bai's family

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:40.790
is doing business with Xinhai, right?

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.040
Will they think as you do?

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:07.840
What are you doing here? Leave!

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:08.790
Zhacuo.

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.200
Let's talk.

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:13.690
I have nothing to talk to you about.

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:14.270
Leave!

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.250
Do you have a death wish?

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:47.930
Don't you know

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.810
what kind of person Meng Yaohui is?

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:50.540
He came to you,

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:51.890
and you should've refused him directly.

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:53.140
Why are you discussing it with us?

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.740
There's nothing to discuss.

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:56.930
Since the coal mine is closed,

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.860
I can't cash out my shares.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.000
Meng said

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.810
he could pay a high price

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:02.640
for my shares.

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:04.010
Shares?

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:05.360
Why don't you just

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.560
sell yourself to him?

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.460
But I really am

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:12.400
under a lot of pressure

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.900
because of the mortgage.

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:16.730
My wife even borrowed money
from her family.

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:17.650
Everyone has a family

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:18.580
to feed now.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.250
We have to make a living.

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:21.140
Look at Bai.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.660
He's on leave!

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.700
If you want to talk about pressure,

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.160
who isn't under pressure?

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:27.590
I-I...

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:28.570
Aren't we all

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:29.030
doing this

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:29.700
under pressure?

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:30.410
Yeah, yeah.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.430
Zhacuo, listen to me.

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:32.290
Think about it.

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:34.010
The Mountain Patrol
had it worse back then,

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:35.810
but we got through it, didn't we?

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:37.140
I don't get it anyway.

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:38.510
Is there any point

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:39.380
investigating Xinhai now?

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:40.860
Of course there's a point.

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:43.250
I think the Xinhai case

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:44.110
and the Captain's case

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:45.410
are the same thing.

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.610
You're still bringing that up?

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:48.440
In the beginning,

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.030
wasn't it because we thought

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:51.250
you could solve the Captain's case

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:52.000
that everyone followed you

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.030
to do this?

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:54.070
But now look,

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:55.310
we've found nothing

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:56.850
and got into a lot of trouble.

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:57.820
You need to speak

00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:58.940
with a conscience.

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:00.940
What trouble did you get into?

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:02.000
Even if we didn't investigate Xinhai,

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:02.720
your

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:03.720
dry shares in the coal mining company

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:04.980
would still be stuck.

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:06.590
Now, you drive a nice car

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:07.290
and live in a nice house.

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:08.350
You've had it too good.

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:09.350
I think you've forgotten

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.900
whose side

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:10.570
you're on.

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:11.070
You...

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:12.050
-Shao Yunfei.
-To be blunt,

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:12.850
now that Meng Yaohui

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:13.680
offers you some benefits,

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:14.670
you've wavered.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000
You can't convince us,

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.030
so you change the subject,

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:18.160
saying the investigation is troublesome

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:18.680
and pointless.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.180
Actually,

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:20.070
it's just that you can't get benefits
anymore.

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:20.290
Enough.

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:21.250
You're angry out of embarrassment.

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:22.310
But let me tell you,

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:24.430
taking it out on us won't help.

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:25.550
Anger is just

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:26.420
a sign of incompetence.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:27.570
Do it if you can.

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:28.270
If you don't want to,

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:28.960
then quit.

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:29.920
We don't need you.

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.090
I'll teach you a lesson for your father.

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:31.570
Fine.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.940
You say that every time.

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:33.360
Isn't it annoying?

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:34.070
Shao Yunfei.

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:36.400
"I'll teach you a lesson for your father."

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:37.500
Let go!

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:38.610
What are you doing?

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:39.400
Stop fighting!

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:39.980
Stop fighting!

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:40.720
Let go!

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:41.530
Let go!

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:42.410
Stop fighting!

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:43.510
Stop fighting!

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:50.780
It's not just about investigating
illegal coal trafficking

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:52.150
and illegal mining.

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:53.520
These are just

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:54.810
speculations for now,

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.830
but contraband was found

00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:58.070
in Han's dorm,

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.370
and Meng Yaohui came to give Zhacuo

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:01.570
share compensation,

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:02.440
trying to find out

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.960
what exactly I've uncovered.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:04.480
What do you think

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.940
they are so nervous about?

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:10.350
This Zhacuo, really,

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:12.720
is too heavy-handed.

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:15.490
He actually held back.

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.560
Otherwise,
I'd be in an ambulance right now.

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.410
What's wrong with your back?

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:30.980
I'm fine.

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:35.340
It's been like this lately.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:40.860
My mom has a set of

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.010
moxibustion tools.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.090
But she's on the night shift today,

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:46.310
and she won't be back.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:49.500
I'll go see her tomorrow.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:50.560
It's okay.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.250
I'll figure it out when we get back

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:53.310
and try to help you.

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:55.440
I sprained my back last time

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:56.830
and have some plasters left.

00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:58.230
I'll put one on you later.

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:01.220
Do you want it?

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:01.640
Yes.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:02.810
Yes, yes.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:04.380
Yes.

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:19.030
Mom.

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:20.360
You're all here.

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:22.110
You didn't go to your night shift?

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:23.770
Shao Yunfei just sprained his back.

00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:25.500
Where is your moxibustion kit?

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:32.010
You should go back first.

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:34.240
We have some family matters to discuss.

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:36.510
What's wrong?

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:40.500
Mr. Meng,

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:41.920
there must be a mistake.

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:42.840
Our grass seeds

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:43.400
went through

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.980
strict selection and control.

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.400
There can't be any problems.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.730
And the previous scheduled inspections

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:48.710
were all normal.

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.740
It was clearly

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:50.610
growing well,

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.380
then suddenly turned yellow.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.440
This is definitely not normal.

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:56.590
The inspection team
happened to be visiting at the time.

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:57.270
They immediately

00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:58.670
took photos as evidence.

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.690
The company takes this very seriously

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:02.290
and wants a re-examination.

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:04.790
We need to take samples from the field.

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:07.070
If you pass the re-examination,

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:08.200
you can resume work.

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:12.900
But if you don't,

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:14.250
and your grass seeds

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:15.970
are confirmed to be adulterated,

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:17.750
you will be liable for damages.

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:19.640
This will also involve

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:20.970
a breach of contract.

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:22.610
How can this
be considered a breach of contract?

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:23.260
At most,

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:24.850
it's just substandard work.

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:25.220
Then...

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:26.590
we'll just redo it.

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.480
If the grass seeds
are found to be adulterated,

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:31.960
then Changqing commits contract fraud.

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:33.800
As the legal representative,

00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:34.500
you will have to bear

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.530
the corresponding legal responsibilities.

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:37.460
Is that clear?

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:40.770
This is absolutely lawless.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:41.700
Meng Yaohui

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:42.850
is threatening you.

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:44.480
He's threatening us.

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:45.940
Bai Ju,

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.220
aren't you and Meng Yaohui

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:48.480
on pretty good terms?

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:49.170
Mom,

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:50.120
stay out of this.

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:50.970
You don't understand.

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:52.500
I don't understand either.

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:53.400
I only found out

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.660
today.

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:55.200
Earlier,

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.160
someone reported to the inspection team

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.750
about Xinhai's illegal mining.

00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:59.010
It was you, wasn't it?

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:05.090
So that's where the problem lies.

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.700
Serves you right.

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.830
Bai Ji.

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.190
What are you saying?

00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:11.720
Bai Ji, what do you mean?

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:12.660
What do I mean?

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:13.520
I deserve it

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:14.780
when he turned against me!

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:16.180
I deserve to go bankrupt!

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:17.440
I deserve to go to jail!

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:20.940
Behind my back,

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:21.690
however you mess with Xinhai,

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:22.740
I don't care!

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:24.110
But can't you think about me?

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:25.380
Think about Chun?

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.420
I warned you back then.

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:29.640
You said Chun was in charge too,

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.990
so I kept my mouth shut.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:31.610
Besides,

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:32.870
with Uncle Lin's recommendation,

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:34.270
I didn't think much of it.

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:35.900
As for reporting Xinhai

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:37.200
and alerting the enemy,

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.510
I only found out later.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.310
Of course you didn't have to think much.

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:42.010
You didn't pay a cent.

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:43.310
Chun, Shao,

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:43.950
Mom, and I

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:45.350
threw all our money in.

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:46.270
You only care

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:47.900
about yourself!

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:50.080
Who do you care about in this family?

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:50.750
Bai Ji,

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:52.210
how can you talk like that?

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:54.960
I really don't understand.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.330
Why are you so afraid?

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:57.770
We have nothing to hide.

00:28:57.770 --> 00:28:59.000
Xinhai is the one breaking the law.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.340
We didn't do anything wrong.

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:01.000
I don't understand

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.460
what you're afraid of!

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:03.610
What am I afraid of?

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:04.480
Ju,

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:05.330
I don't know

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:06.770
if you're actually stupid

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:07.970
or just playing dumb.

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:10.030
You guys kept messing with Xinhai.

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:11.270
It even went to the inspection team.

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:12.530
And what is the result?

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.300
The regreening project.

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.460
That's a huge deal!

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:16.680
Meng Yaohui dared to use this

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:17.650
to threaten me!

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:18.730
Why?

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:20.610
Because in Tianduo,

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:21.960
Xinhai

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.710
controls everything!

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:25.900
-Do I have to spell it out for you?
-Let me tell you, Bai Ji!

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:26.920
They can't do it!

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:28.280
What makes you so sure?

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:29.290
When that happens,

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:30.350
can you protect me?

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:31.070
Can you protect Chun?

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:32.670
Can you protect Mom and Shao?

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:34.010
All these years,

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:34.940
Bai Ju,

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:36.380
have you even figured out

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:37.590
your own mess?

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:38.400
Have you figured out

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.250
the Duojie case?

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:39.810
Bai Ji!

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.240
Justice...

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.220
Justice might be late.

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:52.850
Don't give me

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:53.790
your empty talk.

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:54.600
Late?

00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:55.510
Fine.

00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:56.980
Then how long

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:57.670
will we wait

00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:58.850
for it to arrive?

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:01.270
Wait until we lose everything

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:02.450
and the family is destroyed?

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:03.850
Will it be of any use then?

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:04.770
Bai Ji.

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:06.960
How can you...

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:07.570
Ju.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:08.550
Ju, Ju.

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:10.700
Let me just ask you one thing.

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:12.750
For the sake of our family,

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:15.370
can you just stop with the Xinhai business

00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:17.140
for now?

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:17.850
I'm not asking you

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:19.180
to let it go completely.

00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:21.960
I'm begging you.

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:23.460
I'm begging you.

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:24.850
For the family,

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.010
can you just pause

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.240
for a bit?

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:37.860
I never thought...

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:41.870
I never thought my own brother

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:43.600
could say such things.

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:48.440
You're not my biological sister anyway.

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.740
Bai Ji, what are you saying?

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:50.730
Did I say something wrong?

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:52.790
In the end, we're not blood-related!

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:53.650
-Mom!
-Stop!

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:54.850
Did I say something wrong?

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:55.270
Mom, Mom, Mom!

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:56.530
Do we owe her anything?

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:57.130
Enough! Shut your mouth!

00:30:57.130 --> 00:30:57.980
She can't treat us like this!

00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:58.910
Get out! Get out!

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:00.040
I owe you!

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.460
What nonsense are you spouting?

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:01.050
You treat us like this!

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:01.830
Shut up!

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:03.940
Bai Ju, your personality...

00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:19.070
It's just like Wang Xia's.

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:26.480
That day,

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:29.290
the forecast predicted a blizzard.

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:31.650
I told her

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.010
not to go on your rounds.

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:36.180
The township she was going to

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:37.400
was too far.

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:41.200
Blizzards would come without warning.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.930
They wouldn't wait for anyone.

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:45.980
But she said

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:48.630
patients wouldn't wait for you either.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.700
Later, Yang went with her.

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:02.530
She was so stubborn.

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:04.790
Once her mind was set on something,

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:06.550
everything else came second.

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:13.330
You're just like her in that way.

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:30.460
But from the moment

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:31.520
I brought you home,

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:33.400
you became my child.

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:36.050
We're kin.

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:40.320
Your brother
was just saying that out of anger.

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:42.250
I know you...

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:43.030
Mom, I know.

00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:48.420
I'm not mad at him.

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:55.610
You're a good kid.

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:00.670
But I'm afraid to even think about it.

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:01.880
If Bai Ji

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:03.270
really goes that far...

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:09.810
It isn't easy for him

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.320
to get where he is today.

00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:14.100
And regarding this matter,

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:17.090
when it comes down to it,

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:18.690
he didn't do anything wrong.

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:21.810
Maybe these years,

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:23.840
we've had it too good,

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:26.890
and we forgot one thing.

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:29.430
We

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:30.920
can lose everything else,

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:33.260
but we can't lose

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.370
our integrity.

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:42.810
Mom.

00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:44.920
But I can't bring myself

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:45.760
to say this

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:47.250
to Bai Ji's face.

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:53.870
I don't know

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:55.200
what to do anymore.

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:42.440
Mom told me everything.

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.560
She asked me to come check on you.

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:48.880
She said...

00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:53.710
she loves you both equally.

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:00.760
Bai Ju...

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.050
If we weren't kin,

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:03.400
things would be easier.

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:06.390
Just for the truth,

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:10.880
do I really have to sacrifice Bai Ji,

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:13.130
Mom,

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:16.930
and the whole family?

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:20.780
Why should they

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:24.940
bear this with me?

00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:30.390
If back then,

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.720
Mom hadn't saved me,

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:37.570
and I wasn't

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:38.830
part of this family...

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.400
I'm a police officer.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.980
But I'm also a daughter,

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:51.000
a big sister,

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:52.750
a little sister,

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:56.180
and a mother.

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:04.310
I really don't blame Bai Ji this time.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.120
His worries are actually valid.

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:13.850
First, it is Zhacuo and others,

00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:16.890
then it is Bai Ji.

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.920
Meng Yaohui
dared to bring it into the open this time,

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:23.260
threatening us
with the regreening project.

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:24.790
This is just the first step.

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:31.920
What comes next?

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:36.460
What should I do?

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.760
You won't stop.

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:44.240
When the time comes,

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:47.590
just keep moving forward.

00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:49.460
Don't be afraid.

00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:53.650
I'll stay and watch the house.

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.050
This home

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:01.660
is my home too.

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.270
So I can only count on you

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.490
when it's absolutely necessary, huh?

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:34.950
You're feeling better.

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:36.840
What?

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:39.620
You've got the energy to tease me again.

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:42.910
But you've forgotten

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.530
what I said before.

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:47.260
I won't suddenly leave.

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:51.450
I'll only suddenly appear

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:54.210
when you need me.

00:38:00.370 --> 00:38:01.970
I lost the Captain back then.

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:03.750
Now, I can't lose

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:04.980
my brother too.

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:50.920
At Xinhai Coal Mine in our city,

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.530
a major coal theft occurred.

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:53.010
The involved

00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:54.010
field dispatcher

00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:54.730
and security guard

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:56.590
are under police investigation.

00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:58.320
Xinhai has cooperated

00:38:58.320 --> 00:38:59.000
with the public security department

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.340
to form a special investigation team.

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:01.130
They are comprehensively reviewing

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:02.690
the coal management process,

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:03.340
launching full background checks

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.890
on involved positions

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:06.870
and retracing operational procedures.

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:07.310
Next,

00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:08.960
we will upgrade the monitoring system.

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:10.320
For coal transportation

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.360
and storage,

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:13.210
we will implement
full-process supervision,

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:14.610
ensuring every ton of coal

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:15.650
is traceable to its source,

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:17.910
and that its destination is controlled.

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:34.310
You're awake.

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:35.190
Here, perfect timing.

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.960
Freshly cooked.

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:36.490
It's hot.

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:39.110
Who was it last night, saying

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:40.950
he would watch the house?

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:43.990
I'm going away for a few days.

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:45.830
I can't keep you company.

00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:47.140
Take care of yourself.

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:49.170
I saw it.

00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:51.510
You're going on a business trip?

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:55.640
Don't miss me too much.

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:56.710
I won't.

00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:03.100
I'll call you directly.

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:12.580
Where are you going?

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:13.590
Qianduo.

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:23.030
I found the draft report

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:24.320
about the Mazhi County

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.130
Investment Promotion Conference,

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:25.800
which Uncle Lin gave me

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:26.710
from back then.

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:30.240
It mentions the Xihai Chamber of Commerce.

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:31.440
Following this clue,

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:32.600
I found

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:34.410
the member list
of the Xihai Chamber of Commerce.

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:35.540
There is a name on it.

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:40.090
Feng Keqing.

00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:40.530
Yes.

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:42.800
Your guess might be correct.

00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:44.730
Although I don't know how close

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:46.020
Feng Keqing and Uncle Lin were

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:47.000
back then,

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:49.630
they should have met

00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:50.330
in Mazhi.

00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:52.330
And I suspect

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:54.030
Feng Keqing's identity back then

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:54.780
was more than just

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:55.690
a small businessman

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:56.280
running a restaurant

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:56.940
in Chengdu.

00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:57.460
Later, he

00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:58.990
took over a mining company.

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:01.590
It was the predecessor of Xinhai.

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:02.750
It's called

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:04.400
Chengdu Tengda Mining.

00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:07.070
That name...

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.280
sounds familiar.

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.030
You're really here
for mineral exploration?

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:13.280
Yes, yes.

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:14.940
We are from Chengdu Tengda Mining.

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:17.470
We came to Bolamula
for mineral exploration.

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:19.740
We didn't bring much money.

00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:20.960
How much do you want?

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:24.600
This company belongs to Feng Keqing?

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:26.530
Chengdu Tengda Mining

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:27.800
originally belonged to a merchant

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:28.900
named Zhao Yuji.

00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:31.040
You should have seen this man.

00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:32.990
Zhao Yuji.

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.150
About

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:37.900
the mineral exploration report

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:39.610
we discussed last time,

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:40.980
when will it be ready?

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.750
I have nothing to say.

00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:51.500
Don't interview me.

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:53.610
Manager Zhao,

00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:54.930
you must have misunderstood.

00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:56.150
I'm not here to interview you.

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:57.080
I just want to know about

00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:59.340
the situation in Mazhi County back then.

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:02.770
Isn't that still an interview?

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:04.940
I've told Ding

00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:06.820
very clearly already.

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:09.670
I've long forgotten

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:11.700
those things in the past.

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:13.280
And I

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:15.700
don't want to recall them either.

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:16.890
Mining

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:18.390
was a lifetime ago.

00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:21.120
Environmental protection

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:23.180
has nothing to do with me either.

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:24.740
I don't care if you are

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:25.710
from the provincial capital

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:27.030
or from Beijing.

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:29.270
It has nothing to do with me.

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:32.610
I know you were one of the first

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:33.520
to enter Bolamula

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.520
for the pilot mineral exploration.

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:36.800
So I want...

00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:38.200
So I'm guilty, right?

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:41.530
So I'm guilty, right?

00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:42.380
I absolutely

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:43.390
didn't mean that,

00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:44.190
Manager Zhao.

00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:45.400
I-I really...

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:46.490
You reporters

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:48.170
only say what those people

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:49.840
want to hear.

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:51.880
To tell you the truth,

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:53.210
I don't have a single word

00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:54.630
that they want to hear.

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:55.460
Leave, leave!

00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:56.230
Hurry and leave!

00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:57.290
-Manager Zhao.
-Leave!

00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:58.890
I just want to hear the truth.

00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:03.460
Manager Zhao.

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:05.540
Manager Zhao.
