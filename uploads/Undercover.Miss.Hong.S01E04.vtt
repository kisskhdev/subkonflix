{\an8}UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

00:00:50.196 --> 00:00:51.406
Hello.

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:52.866
I am Hong Jang-mi.

00:00:56.828 --> 00:00:58.788
{\an8}HONG JANG-MI

00:01:03.585 --> 00:01:05.336
Take a seat, President Shin.

00:01:06.337 --> 00:01:07.172
You too.

00:01:07.922 --> 00:01:08.756
Sit.

00:01:17.265 --> 00:01:19.601
You belong to
the Risk Management Division.

00:01:20.393 --> 00:01:21.728
What were you doing

00:01:21.811 --> 00:01:23.897
in the Trading Division
on the day of the incident?

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.025
I was assisting
with the lunch deliveries in Trading.

00:01:27.984 --> 00:01:29.736
It's difficult for traders
to leave their desks

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:31.112
before the market closes.

00:01:31.696 --> 00:01:34.782
Yet there was only one female employee
in charge of delivering all their lunches.

00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:36.492
Do you admit your wrongdoing?

00:01:38.411 --> 00:01:39.245
No.

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.289
Did you intentionally cause

00:01:41.998 --> 00:01:43.583
the order error incident?

00:01:44.834 --> 00:01:45.668
Me?

00:01:46.377 --> 00:01:48.588
Did your careless behavior trigger

00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:50.590
a domino-like chain of disruption?

00:01:50.673 --> 00:01:52.425
- Dominos?
- Ms. Hong! You--

00:01:52.508 --> 00:01:53.551
Just a moment.

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:57.222
Mr. So.

00:01:57.305 --> 00:02:01.017
What happened to the investors who bought
Hanye Electronics stock at that time?

00:02:02.101 --> 00:02:03.561
The Korea Exchange mediated,

00:02:03.645 --> 00:02:07.690
and we amicably recovered the funds
from the other investment firms.

00:02:07.774 --> 00:02:09.776
However, Onemillion Investments,

00:02:10.276 --> 00:02:13.238
a Texas-based US firm,
still remains unreachable.

00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:14.447
What's the amount?

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.950
At the market price that day,

00:02:18.368 --> 00:02:20.328
it came to about three billion won.

00:02:24.874 --> 00:02:26.834
TO THE WORLD! TO THE FUTURE!
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.466
Beyond the Han River, to the World!
To the Future! Hanmin!

00:02:34.592 --> 00:02:37.845
That three billion was entrusted to us
by our investors.

00:02:39.138 --> 00:02:40.556
We must recover the funds first.

00:02:41.182 --> 00:02:42.767
I believe those funds

00:02:43.351 --> 00:02:45.103
must be retrieved, no matter what.

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:47.814
Ms. Hong,

00:02:48.481 --> 00:02:51.067
are you expressing an intent
to resolve this matter by any means?

00:02:52.777 --> 00:02:53.695
Who, me?

00:02:53.778 --> 00:02:56.114
Mr. So, what do you say?

00:02:57.073 --> 00:03:00.368
Both Hanmin and the Korea Exchange
fell short of delivering on this.

00:03:00.451 --> 00:03:03.871
I'm not sure how Ms. Hong
will be able to accomplish such a feat.

00:03:03.955 --> 00:03:05.999
She's clearly determined.

00:03:06.082 --> 00:03:08.543
Secure a signed agreement
for order cancellation

00:03:09.127 --> 00:03:10.044
from Onemillion.

00:03:12.255 --> 00:03:13.214
You want me to do that?

00:03:19.178 --> 00:03:21.764
Hey, can you hear anything?

00:03:24.726 --> 00:03:25.601
Good morning.

00:03:26.185 --> 00:03:27.103
Hello, sir.

00:03:28.146 --> 00:03:29.272
Good morning.

00:03:29.355 --> 00:03:30.356
Hello, sir.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.482
Hello.

00:03:33.443 --> 00:03:34.944
Ms. Hong, how'd it go?

00:03:35.028 --> 00:03:37.238
We heard Big Al's father shout earlier.

00:03:37.321 --> 00:03:39.032
Let's talk back at the office. Let's go.

00:03:39.115 --> 00:03:42.118
Don't tell me you were out here
waiting for me this whole time.

00:03:43.202 --> 00:03:44.037
We weren't.

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:55.715
They just kept trying to make it seem like
the order error was solely on me.

00:03:55.798 --> 00:03:57.633
That's messed up.

00:03:57.717 --> 00:03:59.135
How wronged you must feel.

00:03:59.218 --> 00:04:00.094
Totally.

00:04:00.178 --> 00:04:02.889
I suggested they should be focused
on retrieving the lost money first.

00:04:02.972 --> 00:04:03.931
- Money?
- What money?

00:04:04.015 --> 00:04:05.350
The three billion that got away?

00:04:07.685 --> 00:04:08.770
Ms. Hong.

00:04:08.853 --> 00:04:11.439
You made quite an impressive
empty promise back there.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.733
You're hilarious.

00:04:13.816 --> 00:04:14.817
"Hilarious"?

00:04:15.443 --> 00:04:17.278
The responsible party flees,

00:04:17.362 --> 00:04:20.156
and I'm about to be fired
for cleaning up their mess.

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.074
Is that hilarious?

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:26.204
Look at you talking back
with all that attitude.

00:04:26.287 --> 00:04:28.247
Is that how you were raised?

00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:31.125
Yes. My mom and dad taught me that.

00:04:31.793 --> 00:04:34.003
You're the dad of two daughters,
aren't you?

00:04:34.087 --> 00:04:37.048
Do they know that you torment
someone else's daughter at work?

00:04:37.131 --> 00:04:39.342
Hey, family's off limits!

00:04:39.425 --> 00:04:40.676
- So petty!
- Come on now!

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.970
Mr. Cha, that's enough.

00:04:43.054 --> 00:04:44.013
Mind your manners.

00:04:44.097 --> 00:04:45.431
- But she--
- Manners!

00:04:46.015 --> 00:04:46.891
Manners.

00:04:50.728 --> 00:04:52.814
Thank you for calling.
You've reached Risk Management.

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:54.524
Yes, sir.

00:04:56.067 --> 00:04:56.943
Just a moment.

00:04:57.652 --> 00:04:58.486
It's the president.

00:04:59.821 --> 00:05:01.030
He's probably calling
about your termination.

00:05:01.906 --> 00:05:04.659
I'm only being this polite
because I still work here.

00:05:04.742 --> 00:05:06.077
Stop fighting.

00:05:09.497 --> 00:05:10.373
Put him on speakerphone.

00:05:14.836 --> 00:05:16.003
Hello, sir.

00:05:16.587 --> 00:05:18.047
Has Ms. Hong updated you?

00:05:18.548 --> 00:05:19.382
On what exactly?

00:05:21.134 --> 00:05:23.010
I'm to find Onemillion Investments

00:05:23.553 --> 00:05:25.054
and secure
the order cancellation agreement.

00:05:25.805 --> 00:05:26.639
Why?

00:05:27.265 --> 00:05:28.099
Why would she?

00:05:28.182 --> 00:05:30.309
Ms. Hong volunteered.

00:05:31.185 --> 00:05:33.146
She must be insane.

00:05:34.564 --> 00:05:35.481
And what if

00:05:36.482 --> 00:05:38.025
she fails to secure it?

00:05:38.109 --> 00:05:40.153
Then she will be terminated.

00:05:43.239 --> 00:05:45.658
No, you see, what happened was…

00:05:45.741 --> 00:05:46.576
- Forget it.
- Please.

00:05:48.661 --> 00:05:50.621
- I hope you do.
- Just forget it.

00:05:58.796 --> 00:06:02.550
And this is the last time
you answer my call on speaker.

00:06:06.262 --> 00:06:07.138
Did you call for me, sir?

00:06:07.722 --> 00:06:09.515
You must know Ms. Hong. You live together.

00:06:10.933 --> 00:06:13.561
"Seoul City Dormitory
for Single Female Workers, Room 301."

00:06:13.644 --> 00:06:14.729
She's your roommate.

00:06:15.897 --> 00:06:16.731
Yes, that's right.

00:06:16.814 --> 00:06:20.026
It's not just the two of us.
There are four of us living together.

00:06:20.109 --> 00:06:21.360
I wouldn't say we're friends.

00:06:22.612 --> 00:06:23.613
We're not close at all.

00:06:24.197 --> 00:06:25.656
I've been informed

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.409
that she scored the highest
on the written recruitment exam.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.996
I heard top-performing students
are normally hired early

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:33.414
in commercial high schools.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:36.167
Yes, that is normally the case.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.587
However, it appears
that Ms. Hong took a gap period

00:06:40.171 --> 00:06:41.297
after graduation.

00:06:44.425 --> 00:06:47.970
I'm not sure
if I should be telling you this…

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:50.348
Please speak candidly.

00:06:50.932 --> 00:06:52.725
If I were to share a few observations…

00:06:53.267 --> 00:06:56.354
She's a long way
from being mild-mannered, compliant,

00:06:56.437 --> 00:06:58.814
or respectful to her seniors.

00:06:58.898 --> 00:07:00.608
She steers clear of such qualities.

00:07:00.691 --> 00:07:03.694
She probably failed every other interview.

00:07:03.778 --> 00:07:05.571
Also, she lacks interpersonal skills.

00:07:05.655 --> 00:07:07.156
She's quite stubborn,

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.867
and her fingers are
a tad bit on the sticky side.

00:07:10.993 --> 00:07:12.495
I see.

00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:17.083
You may leave.

00:07:17.917 --> 00:07:18.751
Yes, sir.

00:07:37.812 --> 00:07:39.438
Why do things keep blowing up?

00:07:39.522 --> 00:07:41.524
Why? I need to find Yehppee!

00:07:47.738 --> 00:07:51.075
Trying to fire a minion for damage control
only makes them more suspicious.

00:07:51.158 --> 00:07:52.618
The order-entry error?

00:07:52.702 --> 00:07:54.412
It has to be connected to the slush fund.

00:07:54.912 --> 00:07:56.122
I'll expose the truth.

00:07:56.205 --> 00:07:57.873
I refuse to leave until I do.

00:07:57.957 --> 00:07:58.958
I refuse!

00:08:06.465 --> 00:08:08.926
EPISODE 4: SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY

00:08:20.521 --> 00:08:23.357
{\an8}Was it really that difficult

00:08:24.525 --> 00:08:26.736
{\an8}to quietly set aside just three billion

00:08:27.236 --> 00:08:31.240
{\an8}while the prosecution
and the FSS had their guard down?

00:08:31.824 --> 00:08:33.117
{\an8}Did I ask too much of you?

00:08:35.202 --> 00:08:37.371
{\an8}What a ruckus you've caused.

00:08:39.332 --> 00:08:40.583
{\an8}I'm sorry, sir.

00:08:40.666 --> 00:08:42.251
{\an8}I met with the CEO of Onemillion.

00:08:43.044 --> 00:08:46.547
{\an8}We agreed to delay cashing out
until things quiet down.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.009
Since I started this,

00:08:50.092 --> 00:08:51.636
I will see it through.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:02.897
HANYE ELECTRONICS 11:27

00:09:04.023 --> 00:09:04.940
It's a simple order.

00:09:06.275 --> 00:09:09.111
You'll be compensated handsomely
for your services.

00:09:21.082 --> 00:09:24.502
I'm sure Myeong-hwi's passing
was just as upsetting for you

00:09:25.795 --> 00:09:27.838
as it was for me.

00:09:28.756 --> 00:09:31.467
But still, it's better
to honor him with success,

00:09:33.135 --> 00:09:34.637
not regret.

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.976
Do you plan on disappointing me?

00:09:41.894 --> 00:09:44.980
No, sir. Please give me another chance.

00:09:50.528 --> 00:09:51.737
That's enough.

00:09:58.494 --> 00:09:59.578
Are you drinking booze?

00:09:59.662 --> 00:10:02.581
Have some class.
Show some dignity as the future chairman.

00:10:02.665 --> 00:10:03.666
Watch how I drink it.

00:10:03.749 --> 00:10:05.876
President Shin is so annoying.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.045
He'll fire away if we can't catch
the CEO of Onemillion.

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:10.715
What? Fire you?

00:10:11.382 --> 00:10:12.842
Dad, have some class.

00:10:14.135 --> 00:10:15.469
Not me.

00:10:15.553 --> 00:10:16.679
Ms. Hong.

00:10:18.556 --> 00:10:21.016
Hey, you make sure
you stay out of this one.

00:10:21.726 --> 00:10:24.103
Did you hear about the rumors too?

00:10:24.603 --> 00:10:25.438
There are rumors?

00:10:26.188 --> 00:10:27.440
There's a rumor going around

00:10:27.523 --> 00:10:30.443
about how there was
another suspicious transaction in Trading

00:10:30.526 --> 00:10:31.527
about a year ago as well.

00:10:36.282 --> 00:10:37.366
Keep this to yourself.

00:10:37.992 --> 00:10:41.579
The chairman ordered Mr. So
to manipulate the market…

00:10:43.164 --> 00:10:44.165
to gather funds

00:10:44.248 --> 00:10:47.251
to fill that slush fund reservoir
slowly but surely.

00:10:47.334 --> 00:10:49.462
So that no one can see
what lies beneath the surface.

00:10:50.504 --> 00:10:51.338
What about you?

00:10:51.922 --> 00:10:53.424
- Have you seen it?
- What?

00:10:54.008 --> 00:10:55.176
That slush fund reservoir.

00:10:56.385 --> 00:10:57.928
I never got a chance to.

00:10:59.597 --> 00:11:01.766
The chairman is the only one
who knows where it is.

00:11:02.349 --> 00:11:03.893
I feel like Ms. Song might know.

00:11:05.102 --> 00:11:07.146
I'm still about to lose
one of my employees!

00:11:07.229 --> 00:11:09.732
That's how you respond
after I painstakingly explain everything?

00:11:09.815 --> 00:11:11.901
You just have to fire one employee

00:11:11.984 --> 00:11:14.528
for you to gain
all of Hanmin Investment & Securities.

00:11:34.131 --> 00:11:37.009
PERSONAL DETAILS

00:11:38.844 --> 00:11:41.055
Looking into Assistant Manager Jung
led to General Manager So.

00:11:42.181 --> 00:11:43.807
That's the CEO of Onemillion next to them.

00:11:44.558 --> 00:11:45.684
Just look at them.

00:11:45.768 --> 00:11:48.938
You can clearly tell
it's not their first meeting. Right?

00:11:49.021 --> 00:11:50.523
I thought he was Yehppee,

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:52.525
but he was just a dog.

00:11:52.608 --> 00:11:56.237
Also, the CEO of Onemillion
is a total weasel.

00:11:56.737 --> 00:11:59.031
There were so many chances to lock him up.

00:11:59.114 --> 00:12:00.824
I'd managed to land several jabs

00:12:00.908 --> 00:12:03.327
but never the knockout punch,
so he still walks free.

00:12:04.411 --> 00:12:06.330
But do you think
he'll just sign that agreement

00:12:06.413 --> 00:12:08.165
even if you find him?

00:12:08.249 --> 00:12:09.792
I'll make him.

00:12:09.875 --> 00:12:12.253
Wait, he was granted parole
due to diabetes?

00:12:12.753 --> 00:12:13.671
Yeah.

00:12:13.754 --> 00:12:15.631
I noticed he was
quite a picky eater that day.

00:12:16.465 --> 00:12:18.676
He even has alarms set up
for his medication.

00:12:18.759 --> 00:12:21.679
I should really quit carbs and sweets too.

00:12:22.221 --> 00:12:24.723
But I can't, thanks to a certain someone.

00:12:24.807 --> 00:12:25.641
A certain someone?

00:12:25.724 --> 00:12:28.227
Thanks to a certain someone,
I'm wearing this uniform.

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:30.020
I even had to cut my hair.

00:12:30.104 --> 00:12:33.023
Thanks to a certain someone,
I'm having a pastry and milk for lunch.

00:12:33.649 --> 00:12:36.318
Thanks to a certain someone,
I'm stuck in this damn duck boat!

00:12:36.402 --> 00:12:37.861
I'm almost 60, for goodness' sake.

00:12:37.945 --> 00:12:39.905
I never rode one even when I was dating.

00:12:39.989 --> 00:12:40.990
I can take this, right?

00:12:42.157 --> 00:12:43.367
What do you think?

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:44.702
Showing them that
will only raise suspicions.

00:12:45.995 --> 00:12:49.123
You have to prove it using methods
that would only be accessible

00:12:49.206 --> 00:12:50.541
to the 20-year-old Hong Jang-mi.

00:12:51.542 --> 00:12:53.085
You just have to make a lot of sense.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.006
So Gyeong-dong is out.
He's no longer a Yehppee candidate.

00:12:57.715 --> 00:13:00.926
I can't get fired, so I'll focus on
finding the CEO of Onemillion.

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:03.679
Find me something I can use as leverage
after I catch that weasel.

00:13:03.762 --> 00:13:04.763
Hold on. Let me write that down.

00:13:07.349 --> 00:13:08.642
Lunch is over in ten minutes.

00:13:08.726 --> 00:13:10.102
Turn the boat around. Hurry.

00:13:10.185 --> 00:13:11.437
- Ten minutes?
- We need to move it.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.147
Damn it.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:15.190
We've come too far from the shore.

00:13:15.274 --> 00:13:17.776
We're going backwards! Turn around! Go!

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.864
We're too far from shore!

00:13:23.866 --> 00:13:24.992
It's not an investment firm?

00:13:25.618 --> 00:13:26.535
You're a supermarket?

00:13:27.119 --> 00:13:30.539
After me, he even went and got
General Affairs to sign off on it

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.041
to call overseas.

00:13:32.916 --> 00:13:34.585
Is this not Onemillion Investments?

00:13:34.668 --> 00:13:36.211
But he just keeps speaking in Korean.

00:13:36.795 --> 00:13:37.880
Are you sure?

00:13:37.963 --> 00:13:38.797
Thank you.

00:13:46.972 --> 00:13:48.223
The listed address is in Texas,

00:13:48.307 --> 00:13:51.143
but the number belongs to Vicky Groceries,
a Korean supermarket in LA.

00:13:51.644 --> 00:13:54.938
It seems Onemillion Investments
is a shell company.

00:13:55.981 --> 00:13:58.400
A fake address and a fake phone number,

00:13:58.484 --> 00:14:01.153
and a Korea-born US citizen
sitting in the fake CEO's seat.

00:14:01.236 --> 00:14:03.822
It's likely that a Seoul-based
market rigging pro is behind this.

00:14:03.906 --> 00:14:06.075
- We need to find them--
- And then what?

00:14:08.077 --> 00:14:09.787
If you scored three billion for nothing,

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.164
would you admit to it
and just return it back to the sender?

00:14:13.332 --> 00:14:14.333
That's why we must help.

00:14:14.416 --> 00:14:17.002
Helping her won't change a thing.

00:14:17.753 --> 00:14:20.589
I'm speaking from
years of experience here.

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:23.217
This is a pro's work we're looking at.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:27.554
Ms. Hong, don't waste your time on this.
Just go and beg for your forgiveness.

00:14:27.638 --> 00:14:28.681
But I did nothing wrong.

00:14:28.764 --> 00:14:30.391
Sometimes you just have to suck it up!

00:14:30.474 --> 00:14:31.809
I have no reason to beg.

00:14:31.892 --> 00:14:32.977
That's enough.

00:14:37.022 --> 00:14:38.065
Let's resume tomorrow.

00:14:39.692 --> 00:14:41.360
It's six o'clock. Let's go home.

00:14:41.443 --> 00:14:42.403
All right.

00:14:42.486 --> 00:14:45.114
Nothing beats a drink for a headache.

00:14:45.781 --> 00:14:47.783
- Let's go.
- No thanks.

00:14:48.283 --> 00:14:49.451
Whatever.

00:14:49.535 --> 00:14:51.286
I'll call you when we find a place.

00:15:04.299 --> 00:15:05.217
Damn it.

00:15:15.561 --> 00:15:16.770
Excuse me.

00:15:17.354 --> 00:15:18.272
Excuse me.

00:15:19.231 --> 00:15:22.192
I would prefer to stay out of it,

00:15:23.193 --> 00:15:24.028
but you must know

00:15:25.112 --> 00:15:26.864
the writing is on the wall with this one.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.492
You need to just let it go
without making a fuss.

00:15:33.579 --> 00:15:35.873
Must you insist on keeping Hong Jang-mi?

00:15:42.129 --> 00:15:43.338
Man, that's sweet.

00:15:44.131 --> 00:15:45.215
Mr. Bang.

00:15:45.299 --> 00:15:46.341
Yes?

00:15:46.425 --> 00:15:48.886
You know I'm a regular
at the video store across the street.

00:15:48.969 --> 00:15:50.137
Right.

00:15:50.721 --> 00:15:51.555
Lately,

00:15:52.473 --> 00:15:55.726
finishing films has become impossible,
and the late-fee calls keep coming.

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:57.227
I see.

00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:59.521
Ever since Ms. Hong was hired,

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:02.399
we've been working our butts off.

00:16:02.483 --> 00:16:04.568
- Everyone keeps asking for me.
- Right.

00:16:05.819 --> 00:16:06.653
But you know what?

00:16:12.451 --> 00:16:13.660
I don't hate it.

00:16:14.578 --> 00:16:15.412
Right.

00:16:18.999 --> 00:16:19.917
Although…

00:16:21.418 --> 00:16:23.504
I'm still just a spectator
outside of the ring.

00:16:36.767 --> 00:16:39.770
RISK MANAGEMENT DIVISION

00:17:11.927 --> 00:17:16.223
I heard Hong Keum-bo's parents
are still running that pub in Incheon.

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:19.560
You can't throw up here.

00:17:20.144 --> 00:17:20.978
Let's go.

00:17:21.603 --> 00:17:23.188
SEOKGWAN INN

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:27.818
This is it.

00:17:30.237 --> 00:17:32.322
Have you seen this man before?

00:17:32.406 --> 00:17:34.616
This is the address
on his resident registration record.

00:17:38.829 --> 00:17:40.372
No, I've never seen him before.

00:17:40.455 --> 00:17:43.250
Only the occasional day laborers
stay here for the month.

00:17:43.333 --> 00:17:45.836
Why would a well-dressed man like him
stay at an inn long-term?

00:18:00.017 --> 00:18:01.101
Hey, Mom.

00:18:01.185 --> 00:18:03.478
You're not skipping meals, right?

00:18:03.562 --> 00:18:05.647
You didn't even come home for Chuseok.

00:18:05.731 --> 00:18:06.899
Should I go to you?

00:18:07.691 --> 00:18:10.402
No, don't come. I'll go to you.

00:18:10.903 --> 00:18:11.737
Wait…

00:18:13.614 --> 00:18:14.865
Damn brat.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.546
SEOUN UNIVERSITY

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:31.757
So? What did Keum-bo say?

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.342
Is she free tomorrow?

00:18:48.065 --> 00:18:49.399
They're on the house.

00:18:50.275 --> 00:18:51.443
These chicken legs are?

00:18:51.526 --> 00:18:53.612
Mister, are you married?

00:18:54.238 --> 00:18:55.072
Not yet.

00:18:55.155 --> 00:18:57.491
Oh, I see.

00:18:57.574 --> 00:18:58.742
What about a girlfriend?

00:19:02.287 --> 00:19:03.247
No, I have no girlfriend.

00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:06.792
Got it.

00:19:11.171 --> 00:19:12.005
Thank you.

00:19:18.387 --> 00:19:19.221
Hello there.

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:21.848
This is also on the house.

00:19:21.932 --> 00:19:23.600
It's just a bit of
complimentary white kimchi.

00:19:25.519 --> 00:19:26.979
That looks like a lot.

00:19:27.062 --> 00:19:29.523
They say a son-in-law
is like an honored guest in the family.

00:19:29.606 --> 00:19:32.109
You already feel like family to me.

00:19:34.569 --> 00:19:36.238
Look at those muscular thighs.

00:19:50.127 --> 00:19:51.253
Take care.

00:20:02.889 --> 00:20:03.932
He's so handsome.

00:20:04.016 --> 00:20:06.226
- I mean, I was…
- Mom! Dad!

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:08.520
What are you doing here this late?

00:20:10.564 --> 00:20:12.691
- I'm here for a business trip.
- Goodness me.

00:20:12.774 --> 00:20:15.444
You're way too old for crop tees.

00:20:15.527 --> 00:20:17.195
A woman should keep her belly warm.

00:20:17.279 --> 00:20:19.531
Pull up your pants. No, lower your shirt.

00:20:19.614 --> 00:20:22.576
The man who just left with the bundle.
What was he doing here?

00:20:22.659 --> 00:20:24.494
Did you see him? He's so handsome, right?

00:20:24.578 --> 00:20:26.705
He's not married and has no girlfriend.

00:20:26.788 --> 00:20:30.667
To start, his physique, frame,
and face all passed my test.

00:20:30.751 --> 00:20:32.085
Why would you grade him?

00:20:32.169 --> 00:20:33.670
We must think about the offspring.

00:20:33.754 --> 00:20:34.796
Honey,

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.632
next time, we should ask him for his date
and time of birth so we can check

00:20:37.716 --> 00:20:39.301
- their astrological compatibility.
- Right.

00:20:39.384 --> 00:20:40.427
Mom.

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:43.722
Help us help you. We're so damn tired
of making that white kimchi.

00:20:43.805 --> 00:20:44.806
Hello again.

00:20:46.975 --> 00:20:49.519
I forgot my cellphone.

00:21:19.508 --> 00:21:20.967
- What…
- Hold on.

00:21:21.885 --> 00:21:23.011
- What was that?
- I don't know.

00:21:23.095 --> 00:21:24.596
- What just happened?
- How would I know?

00:21:26.723 --> 00:21:27.557
Wait.

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:30.310
Hold on. Stop.

00:21:34.272 --> 00:21:35.148
Just a second.

00:21:41.196 --> 00:21:43.824
What brings you all the way
to a pub in an alleyway

00:21:43.907 --> 00:21:45.033
of Jemulpo Market in Incheon?

00:21:47.494 --> 00:21:49.538
Don't tell me you're here to see me.

00:21:50.038 --> 00:21:51.206
Is this a background check?

00:21:51.289 --> 00:21:52.457
Am I under surveillance?

00:21:52.541 --> 00:21:54.709
I'm not here for you, Ms. Hong Jang-mi.

00:21:55.544 --> 00:21:57.087
I'm here for Hong Keum-bo.

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:00.215
You're here for my sister?

00:22:00.757 --> 00:22:01.591
No, you.

00:22:03.009 --> 00:22:04.428
On the street in Yeouido the other night,

00:22:04.511 --> 00:22:06.263
at the disciplinary hearing
a few days ago,

00:22:06.346 --> 00:22:08.557
and just now at your parents' restaurant.

00:22:09.099 --> 00:22:10.809
I saw Hong Keum-bo every time.

00:22:12.394 --> 00:22:15.355
Of course, you did.

00:22:15.439 --> 00:22:16.815
We're sisters, after all.

00:22:23.113 --> 00:22:24.698
I still see her now.

00:22:36.168 --> 00:22:37.127
That's why you were dumped.

00:22:38.211 --> 00:22:39.421
What?

00:22:39.504 --> 00:22:41.047
You were dumped by my sister.

00:22:42.424 --> 00:22:45.468
That's not something
you should talk about so lightly.

00:22:45.552 --> 00:22:46.928
As if.

00:22:47.012 --> 00:22:48.555
She told me all about her boy…

00:22:49.139 --> 00:22:51.933
I mean, she told me all about
her relationship with you, President Shin.

00:22:52.017 --> 00:22:54.311
Jeez, you have some gall coming here.

00:22:54.394 --> 00:22:55.854
You know Keum-bo has a temper.

00:22:55.937 --> 00:22:59.983
If I were her,
you would've already been torn to shreds.

00:23:00.775 --> 00:23:02.986
Your remains would be buried
in that sandbox already.

00:23:03.653 --> 00:23:04.487
What did you say?

00:23:04.571 --> 00:23:06.948
You saw Hong Keum-bo in me? Unbelievable.

00:23:07.032 --> 00:23:08.533
Your eyes must be getting old.

00:23:08.617 --> 00:23:10.035
Wear some glasses, will you?

00:23:11.369 --> 00:23:12.537
What about the sandglass?

00:23:12.621 --> 00:23:14.539
Explain the sandglass
on your desk at the office.

00:23:15.957 --> 00:23:17.667
Oh, that?

00:23:18.501 --> 00:23:20.045
I saved that from my sister's garbage.

00:23:20.921 --> 00:23:21.963
She threw it out?

00:23:22.047 --> 00:23:23.298
Yes.

00:23:23.381 --> 00:23:25.342
This too. And this.

00:23:25.967 --> 00:23:28.553
They're all hand-me-downs from my sister.

00:23:28.637 --> 00:23:30.513
All this over nothing.

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:33.350
Leave.

00:23:34.809 --> 00:23:35.810
Good night.

00:23:46.696 --> 00:23:47.656
What the hell?

00:23:50.116 --> 00:23:51.993
No, I'm sure of it.

00:23:52.077 --> 00:23:53.161
I know what I saw.

00:23:53.245 --> 00:23:55.413
I saw it clearly with my own two eyes.

00:23:56.373 --> 00:23:57.624
I saw Keum-bo

00:23:58.375 --> 00:24:00.669
take out this hairpin for some reason.

00:24:00.752 --> 00:24:04.047
I couldn't tell if she was
doing it for her sake or his,

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:07.050
but she fixed her hair
and appearance swiftly.

00:24:07.759 --> 00:24:11.554
Then, the two of them got really close.

00:24:11.638 --> 00:24:14.516
They kept getting close,
then pulling away.

00:24:14.599 --> 00:24:17.394
They carried on what seemed like
a sweet conversation.

00:24:17.477 --> 00:24:19.604
Did you hear what they were saying?

00:24:20.772 --> 00:24:22.857
Damn. No, I couldn't hear anything.

00:24:23.692 --> 00:24:26.486
Jeez. What do you have ears for?

00:24:26.569 --> 00:24:28.280
Your ears and nose have
different holes for a reason.

00:24:28.363 --> 00:24:30.115
No, that's not it.

00:24:30.198 --> 00:24:31.032
You see…

00:24:35.996 --> 00:24:37.372
You're back alone?

00:24:37.455 --> 00:24:39.416
These are some side dishes for you.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.877
What was that about
with the handsome mister earlier?

00:24:43.878 --> 00:24:46.172
Mom, you want to marry me off, right?

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:48.591
Then just quietly wait and see.

00:24:49.134 --> 00:24:51.511
Even if that man comes back here,
don't say a thing.

00:24:51.594 --> 00:24:52.595
Zip it up.

00:24:52.679 --> 00:24:53.930
- Zip.
- Zip.

00:24:59.436 --> 00:25:01.563
- Thanks for the food.
- Sure.

00:25:01.646 --> 00:25:02.689
Get home safely.

00:25:03.648 --> 00:25:04.774
Lower that shirt.

00:25:05.358 --> 00:25:06.693
And take a cab home!

00:25:09.738 --> 00:25:13.408
Shin Jung-woo hasn't changed one bit.
He still has to see it to believe it.

00:25:14.367 --> 00:25:16.119
But he hasn't figured it out yet.

00:25:16.202 --> 00:25:18.705
That's why he's trying to
make me take the fall.

00:25:18.788 --> 00:25:20.874
Or am I wrong? Maybe it's the opposite?

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.136
SEOUL CITY DORMITORY
FOR SINGLE FEMALE WORKERS

00:25:34.679 --> 00:25:36.556
Over here. Nora.

00:25:51.071 --> 00:25:53.198
Why have you been ignoring my calls?

00:25:53.823 --> 00:25:54.657
Here.

00:25:54.741 --> 00:25:58.536
Handmade chocolate from the bakery
in Valis Hotel, your favorite.

00:25:58.620 --> 00:25:59.704
You've missed them, haven't you?

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:09.506
I've been busy. What are you doing here?

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:12.717
It's been forever since
all three members of our family

00:26:12.801 --> 00:26:15.136
have been together in Seoul like this.

00:26:15.762 --> 00:26:18.223
We should go to your dad's this weekend
for some family time.

00:26:19.265 --> 00:26:20.266
You just want me there

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:22.811
because you're worried
he won't open the door if you go alone.

00:26:22.894 --> 00:26:24.813
Listen, the blood ties
between a child and a parent

00:26:24.896 --> 00:26:26.773
don't just disappear because of a divorce.

00:26:26.856 --> 00:26:27.857
"Blood types"?

00:26:27.941 --> 00:26:31.236
Not blood types!
It's not exactly about blood…

00:26:32.779 --> 00:26:34.489
Anyway, that's a thing.

00:26:36.074 --> 00:26:37.033
Kang Nora.

00:26:37.117 --> 00:26:37.992
Listen to me.

00:26:38.618 --> 00:26:41.871
You're Kang Pil-beom's only daughter.

00:26:41.955 --> 00:26:44.582
If anyone gives you hell at work,

00:26:44.666 --> 00:26:46.209
write all their names down
in your notebook.

00:26:46.292 --> 00:26:48.378
When you become chairwoman,
we'll send them packing.

00:26:49.629 --> 00:26:50.797
You want me in that seat?

00:26:51.506 --> 00:26:53.425
Then who else would I want?

00:26:54.884 --> 00:26:57.470
I can do anything for you, Nora.

00:26:59.848 --> 00:27:02.225
Really? You can do anything?

00:27:02.851 --> 00:27:03.810
Yeah.

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:06.646
Do it.

00:27:06.729 --> 00:27:07.981
You told me before

00:27:08.064 --> 00:27:09.732
to stay by the cleverest one at work.

00:27:09.816 --> 00:27:11.776
But that clever Hong Jang-mi

00:27:12.527 --> 00:27:16.156
is about to get fired
after helping me deliver lunches.

00:27:17.824 --> 00:27:19.325
I need her.

00:27:20.493 --> 00:27:21.536
Hong Jang-mi?

00:27:22.328 --> 00:27:23.204
Okay.

00:27:24.289 --> 00:27:25.331
Believe in me.

00:27:25.415 --> 00:27:26.624
JEMULPO GIRLS' COMMERCIAL HIGH SCHOOL

00:27:26.708 --> 00:27:31.671
In the olden days, children feared
tigers, smallpox, and war the most.

00:27:31.754 --> 00:27:36.134
However, today, children face a different
and far more frightening terror

00:27:36.217 --> 00:27:39.846
of becoming delinquent youths
through exposure to harmful videos.

00:27:44.893 --> 00:27:47.270
By choosing videos wisely and responsibly,

00:27:47.353 --> 00:27:50.273
we can help
guide and nurture healthy minds.

00:27:50.356 --> 00:27:54.444
A single video
can change a person's future.

00:27:55.028 --> 00:27:57.280
Jang-mi, come and join us.

00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:58.615
Let's watch a movie.

00:27:59.199 --> 00:28:00.325
No thanks.

00:28:01.075 --> 00:28:02.035
It's a romantic comedy.

00:28:03.077 --> 00:28:04.579
I despise romance.

00:28:16.341 --> 00:28:19.052
A post on Yeouido Pirates
claims you were fired.

00:28:19.135 --> 00:28:20.261
Is it true?

00:28:21.262 --> 00:28:22.722
Not yet.

00:28:22.805 --> 00:28:24.182
I went through hell for this job.

00:28:24.933 --> 00:28:26.601
I refuse to leave empty-handed.

00:28:27.685 --> 00:28:29.729
So delicious. I refuse to let you leave.

00:28:29.812 --> 00:28:30.897
By the way,

00:28:31.523 --> 00:28:34.150
I did read a strange comment earlier.

00:28:36.444 --> 00:28:39.864
THE HIDDEN TRUTH ABOUT
THE FEMALE HANMIN EMPLOYEE

00:28:41.366 --> 00:28:42.617
That one right there.

00:28:43.743 --> 00:28:45.453
"Hong Jang-mi was in on it."

00:28:45.537 --> 00:28:48.790
"She just had the audacity to stab
the great Hanmin in the back afterward."

00:28:49.415 --> 00:28:50.250
Me?

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:54.420
Hong Jang-mi was in on it.

00:28:54.504 --> 00:28:56.506
She just had the audacity
to stab the great Hanmin…

00:28:56.589 --> 00:28:59.717
{\an8}How could she be in on it?
She's just a matronly entry-level minion.

00:28:59.801 --> 00:29:02.220
{\an8}They just used her
because she's a high school grad,

00:29:02.303 --> 00:29:03.429
{\an8}a disposable staff.

00:29:03.513 --> 00:29:04.889
They're deliberately spreading lies.

00:29:06.474 --> 00:29:10.311
Anyone who makes a living
in the stock market is on Yeouido Pirates.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:13.022
As soon as Hong Jang-mi is fired,

00:29:13.106 --> 00:29:14.983
the lies become truths.

00:29:15.775 --> 00:29:16.776
Damn it.

00:29:20.071 --> 00:29:22.532
What if we turn the lies into truths?

00:29:23.616 --> 00:29:25.785
Like "Seodongyo,"
where gossip turned into reality?

00:29:26.703 --> 00:29:27.579
"Seodongyo"?

00:29:32.709 --> 00:29:34.002
{\an8}ADD COMMENT

00:29:34.085 --> 00:29:36.880
{\an8}I hear Hong Jang-mi already got in touch
with the CEO of Onemillion.

00:29:57.108 --> 00:29:59.110
{\an8}SEOUL CITY DORMITORY
FOR SINGLE FEMALE WORKERS

00:30:11.122 --> 00:30:14.542
I wonder if General Manager So Gyeong-dong
was really in the dark

00:30:14.626 --> 00:30:17.045
about all those trading incidents
that happened at Hanmin.

00:30:17.128 --> 00:30:18.129
So Gyeong-dong?

00:30:19.464 --> 00:30:21.382
It sounds like
the Captain knows something.

00:30:27.472 --> 00:30:29.057
Operation Seodongyo is a go.

00:30:30.099 --> 00:30:31.351
Help me out, ladies.

00:30:36.397 --> 00:30:39.317
Having lived such an honest life
full of integrity,

00:30:39.817 --> 00:30:41.861
I'm not crazy about lying,

00:30:43.321 --> 00:30:45.365
but I do owe Hong Jang-mi one.

00:30:45.448 --> 00:30:46.532
I'm in.

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:03.883
Did someone eat my chocolate?

00:31:04.425 --> 00:31:05.969
These are mine.

00:31:06.052 --> 00:31:07.220
There are two missing.

00:31:09.097 --> 00:31:10.974
It was a gift from my mom.

00:31:18.815 --> 00:31:19.649
Pardon me, ma'am.

00:31:20.775 --> 00:31:22.151
Can I help you?

00:31:24.153 --> 00:31:26.364
Hey, don't you know who I am?

00:31:27.156 --> 00:31:29.617
Hello, Madam Choi. This way, please.

00:31:29.701 --> 00:31:31.452
Unbelievable. Who's that kid?

00:31:31.536 --> 00:31:33.079
He must be new here.

00:31:34.288 --> 00:31:36.290
Is it that hard

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.210
to fire a measly girl?

00:31:39.293 --> 00:31:42.964
It'll be difficult for someone of her rank
to track down the CEO in hiding.

00:31:43.756 --> 00:31:45.800
She'll soon wear herself out
and leave on her own.

00:31:46.968 --> 00:31:47.844
Jeez.

00:31:47.927 --> 00:31:49.846
More importantly,

00:31:49.929 --> 00:31:51.723
there are rumors
that an insider was involved

00:31:52.306 --> 00:31:54.475
in the Hanye Electronics incident.

00:31:55.309 --> 00:31:56.269
What did you say?

00:32:05.361 --> 00:32:06.696
- What's wrong with you all?
- Ma'am, you can't…

00:32:06.779 --> 00:32:08.865
- Just tell him I'm here.
- He's in a meeting right now.

00:32:08.948 --> 00:32:10.116
- Unbelievable.
- Ma'am…

00:32:10.199 --> 00:32:11.325
Chairman.

00:32:11.409 --> 00:32:12.702
What are you doing here?

00:32:13.953 --> 00:32:16.164
Can I not visit my kid's office?

00:32:16.247 --> 00:32:18.833
Just barging in whenever you feel like it…

00:32:18.916 --> 00:32:21.419
I've never seen you before.
Who might you be?

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:25.465
I'm Shin Jung-woo.

00:32:25.548 --> 00:32:27.300
He's the newly appointed president.

00:32:28.301 --> 00:32:29.343
I see.

00:32:31.929 --> 00:32:32.764
Don't you know me?

00:32:35.266 --> 00:32:36.100
My apologies.

00:32:38.269 --> 00:32:39.812
I guess you only studied in school.

00:32:41.606 --> 00:32:42.899
How should I introduce myself?

00:32:45.526 --> 00:32:46.360
Are you married?

00:32:47.361 --> 00:32:48.279
Not yet.

00:32:48.362 --> 00:32:49.489
You've never been? I have.

00:32:50.198 --> 00:32:51.032
I haven't.

00:32:53.117 --> 00:32:56.496
Gosh, it's like he came
straight to work after graduating.

00:32:56.579 --> 00:32:58.748
He's just like Myeong-hwi.
They're two peas in a pod.

00:33:00.792 --> 00:33:02.752
You know the late President Kang?

00:33:02.835 --> 00:33:05.004
I used to be his stepmom.

00:33:22.355 --> 00:33:23.898
See you next time.

00:33:24.565 --> 00:33:25.900
Take care, ma'am.

00:33:31.364 --> 00:33:32.907
There are a lot of eyes on you.

00:33:34.408 --> 00:33:35.868
What do you want me to do about it?

00:33:35.952 --> 00:33:39.080
You think they wouldn't notice me
if I kept my mouth shut and behaved?

00:33:39.789 --> 00:33:42.375
I get attention wherever I go,
and I've decided it's my destiny.

00:33:42.458 --> 00:33:44.043
You'll never know how that feels.

00:33:45.002 --> 00:33:46.295
Are you here for a reason?

00:33:47.964 --> 00:33:49.924
My reason will always be Nora.

00:33:50.007 --> 00:33:52.093
She has a friend named Hong Jang-mi.

00:33:52.176 --> 00:33:54.345
Make sure she never gets fired.
That's what I came for.

00:33:59.684 --> 00:34:01.102
In your dreams.

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:06.065
So Kang Nora has a friend now?

00:34:07.817 --> 00:34:08.734
Hong Jang-mi?

00:34:12.864 --> 00:34:15.032
YEOUIDO PIRATES
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

00:34:26.169 --> 00:34:28.588
I hear Ms. Kang
and Hong Jang-mi are friends?

00:34:28.671 --> 00:34:31.424
They joined in the same intake
and are roommates, so Nora…

00:34:32.008 --> 00:34:35.094
I mean, I believe Ms. Kang
considers her a close friend.

00:34:36.846 --> 00:34:39.974
Hong Jang-mi is a typical Gen X.

00:34:40.057 --> 00:34:42.727
She's an immature, fearless 20-year-old.

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:44.353
That does describe

00:34:45.771 --> 00:34:47.064
Ms. Kang's mental age.

00:34:49.025 --> 00:34:52.069
She grew up lonely, so she's quite naive.

00:34:53.279 --> 00:34:54.780
She trusts people too easily.

00:34:57.325 --> 00:34:59.619
You should stay close to her

00:34:59.702 --> 00:35:01.787
and keep a closer eye on her.

00:35:01.871 --> 00:35:05.041
Yes, ma'am. I will do my utmost best.

00:35:09.962 --> 00:35:11.631
Is this Yeouido Pirates post true?

00:35:12.465 --> 00:35:14.050
Did you find the CEO of Onemillion?

00:35:14.133 --> 00:35:16.677
No, I'm just leading everybody on.

00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:20.181
In order to flush him out of hiding
and into the open,

00:35:20.264 --> 00:35:22.391
we need to put strain
on his relationship with Mr. So.

00:35:23.392 --> 00:35:24.977
We have to make him reach out.

00:35:26.145 --> 00:35:28.272
CASH AND SECURITIES,
SMALL-DENOMINATION BONDS/BMF

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:32.777
{\an8}KIM MI-SOOK

00:35:39.533 --> 00:35:41.327
I hear Hanmin's
General Manager So Gyeong-dong

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:42.870
is actively supporting Hong Jang-mi.

00:35:43.621 --> 00:35:45.414
They're hell-bent on catching the culprit.

00:36:08.938 --> 00:36:13.150
General Manager So handed over
all the files to the FSS…

00:36:14.652 --> 00:36:17.238
to clear Hanmin's name.

00:36:17.947 --> 00:36:20.032
…TO CLEANSE HANMIN'S MAME

00:36:24.453 --> 00:36:26.038
THE HIDDEN TRUTH ABOUT
THE FEMALE HANMIN EMPLOYEE

00:36:26.122 --> 00:36:27.832
WHAT WOULD SHE KNOW?
NO ONE KNOWS ANYTHING

00:36:32.837 --> 00:36:35.047
No thief goes around
announcing they're a thief.

00:36:36.924 --> 00:36:39.719
{\an8}Using the high-school grad minion
as a scapegoat and firing her

00:36:39.802 --> 00:36:40.970
{\an8}is crossing the line.

00:36:46.851 --> 00:36:47.685
Ta-da.

00:36:48.686 --> 00:36:49.937
Gosh, what are these?

00:36:52.481 --> 00:36:55.026
- I'll take this one.
- Take this too.

00:36:55.735 --> 00:36:58.821
Did you notice anything
particular about Mr. So?

00:36:59.405 --> 00:37:01.657
Maybe he suddenly stepped out
with his cellphone?

00:37:01.741 --> 00:37:04.076
Or had some lunch plans out of the blue?

00:37:06.412 --> 00:37:09.915
He's glued to his desk
from the moment he comes into work.

00:37:09.999 --> 00:37:11.792
It's like he's tied to that chair.

00:37:12.668 --> 00:37:14.462
I also answer all his calls.

00:37:17.173 --> 00:37:18.257
But…

00:37:19.008 --> 00:37:19.842
But?

00:37:19.925 --> 00:37:23.179
I kept hearing something vibrate
in his desk drawer.

00:37:24.096 --> 00:37:25.389
Buzz-buzz. Like that.

00:37:27.099 --> 00:37:28.100
I see.

00:37:35.191 --> 00:37:37.568
No one's here because
the whole division is out for dinner.

00:37:38.652 --> 00:37:39.528
Why didn't you go?

00:37:39.612 --> 00:37:41.947
No one invited me.

00:37:43.199 --> 00:37:44.992
They just don't know any better.

00:37:45.076 --> 00:37:46.160
Clueless brainiacs.

00:37:47.495 --> 00:37:49.663
I'll take it from here.
You guys can go home.

00:38:10.017 --> 00:38:11.060
Another cellphone?

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.396
Go home, Bok-hee.

00:38:13.479 --> 00:38:14.480
Take her home already.

00:38:39.338 --> 00:38:41.215
MR. SO

00:38:44.552 --> 00:38:45.678
Where are you going?

00:38:57.565 --> 00:38:59.066
I told you not to call me
for the time being.

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:00.734
Why do you keep calling?

00:39:01.235 --> 00:39:03.821
Yes, the FSS's internal probe is done.

00:39:03.904 --> 00:39:06.073
But the company isn't,
so just stop fussing.

00:39:08.033 --> 00:39:10.619
What, you don't believe me,

00:39:11.203 --> 00:39:12.872
but you believe some online gossip rag?

00:39:13.497 --> 00:39:15.875
Just why would I report you,
the CEO of Onemillion?

00:39:15.958 --> 00:39:17.626
I'd be screwing myself over.

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:20.713
Who cares about the sale right now?

00:39:21.338 --> 00:39:22.381
Oh my g--

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.613
Just lie low for the time being,

00:39:46.322 --> 00:39:47.948
and get rid of your Myeongdong office.

00:39:48.824 --> 00:39:49.658
Myeongdong?

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:16.977
Was he directly involved in schemes
to create the slush fund?

00:40:17.686 --> 00:40:19.855
How did you know to target Mr. So?

00:40:20.564 --> 00:40:21.649
What tipped you off?

00:40:24.151 --> 00:40:27.321
Could she have seen his name
in the slush fund ledger back then?

00:40:27.404 --> 00:40:29.990
I found it odd that the incident
occurred within his team,

00:40:30.074 --> 00:40:33.035
but he stepped back and took
no responsibility as the general manager.

00:40:33.953 --> 00:40:35.162
That made me wonder

00:40:35.913 --> 00:40:39.083
who he was
actually working so hard to serve.

00:40:40.084 --> 00:40:43.629
The lunch menu isn't the only decision
office workers have to make.

00:40:44.838 --> 00:40:47.550
Maybe he had chosen complicity,
choosing to look the other way,

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:50.302
to go along with,
and take part in the wrongdoing.

00:40:52.054 --> 00:40:53.847
I just thought you just
looked old for your age,

00:40:53.931 --> 00:40:56.767
but now you sound like a manager
with at least ten years of experience.

00:40:58.269 --> 00:41:00.729
I can't even imagine my thirties.

00:41:02.147 --> 00:41:04.525
The Captain of Yeouido Pirates
left a comment

00:41:04.608 --> 00:41:06.777
that mentioned Mr. So by name.

00:41:07.361 --> 00:41:08.237
I see.

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:09.822
Wasn't that so fun though?

00:41:09.905 --> 00:41:11.031
My heart's still racing.

00:41:12.074 --> 00:41:13.325
Detective play is over now.

00:41:14.952 --> 00:41:15.786
Over.

00:41:22.209 --> 00:41:23.794
- Good morning.
- Yeah. Bonjour.

00:41:23.877 --> 00:41:24.753
Maybe not?

00:41:25.337 --> 00:41:28.090
Why is it still just Wednesday?

00:41:37.433 --> 00:41:41.979
{\an8}OFF-SITE WORK REQUEST

00:41:47.484 --> 00:41:51.071
Ms. Hong, I'd like to help.
Please call me back when you hear this.

00:41:52.573 --> 00:41:53.449
Please.

00:41:56.702 --> 00:41:58.912
You want to help her?
Do you want to know how?

00:41:59.997 --> 00:42:01.081
Yes.

00:42:05.836 --> 00:42:10.090
Help her review the wanted ads
and update her résumé.

00:42:10.174 --> 00:42:12.676
She might actually be out
for an interview today.

00:42:13.218 --> 00:42:14.928
Ms. Hong would never.

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:22.102
I wonder what she's up to.

00:42:27.107 --> 00:42:28.025

Excuse me.

00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:38.786
Hello there.

00:42:38.869 --> 00:42:40.829
{\an8}Have you ever seen this man before?

00:42:41.497 --> 00:42:42.665
{\an8}Maybe.

00:42:42.748 --> 00:42:43.791
Maybe not.

00:42:43.874 --> 00:42:46.043
Is he your husband?
He must be cheating on you!

00:42:46.126 --> 00:42:47.836
- Must be a runaway little brother.
- A little…

00:42:49.213 --> 00:42:51.006
How could he be younger than me? He looks…

00:42:52.216 --> 00:42:53.050
Thanks.

00:42:57.763 --> 00:42:59.431
REAL ESTATE BROKERAGE

00:43:09.149 --> 00:43:11.402
Isn't this Kim from the hardware store?

00:43:11.485 --> 00:43:12.361
Let me see.

00:43:12.444 --> 00:43:15.489
No, that's clearly not him.

00:43:15.572 --> 00:43:16.699
Maybe not?

00:43:16.782 --> 00:43:18.033
Never mind then.

00:43:18.117 --> 00:43:19.952
- Lunch delivery.
- Over here.

00:43:22.871 --> 00:43:23.706
Do you want to eat?

00:43:23.789 --> 00:43:24.915
No, thank you.

00:43:25.457 --> 00:43:27.376
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thanks.

00:43:29.169 --> 00:43:30.921
PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION

00:43:32.548 --> 00:43:34.258
He was granted parole due to diabetes?

00:43:34.341 --> 00:43:35.342
Yeah.

00:43:35.426 --> 00:43:37.302
I noticed he was
quite a picky eater that day.

00:43:38.262 --> 00:43:40.514
He even has alarms set up
for his medication.

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:43.934
{\an8}RESTAURANT

00:43:44.017 --> 00:43:46.395
Did anyone who looked like him ask

00:43:46.478 --> 00:43:49.440
for a special delivery time
or multigrain rice?

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:51.191
Yes, multigrain rice.

00:43:51.734 --> 00:43:53.360
That's him all right.

00:43:53.444 --> 00:43:56.321
Do you remember his address by any chance?

00:43:56.405 --> 00:43:58.323
QUICK PRIVATE LOANS!

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:17.551
Damn. He already ran off.

00:44:25.392 --> 00:44:26.310
Darn it.

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:49.374
Score.

00:44:57.549 --> 00:44:59.593
What is all this?

00:45:00.677 --> 00:45:01.762
You're up?

00:45:09.144 --> 00:45:10.145
I stole it.

You got something?

I'm submitting an off-site work request

OFF-SITE WORK REQUEST

00:46:14.668 --> 00:46:15.711
Again?

Without my approval?

00:46:19.006 --> 00:46:20.549
Where has she gone today?

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:33.061
Aunt…

00:46:38.191 --> 00:46:39.401

Yes?

00:47:59.439 --> 00:48:00.941
Why is he running away?

00:48:02.192 --> 00:48:04.361
Sir! Just a second, sir!

00:48:06.113 --> 00:48:08.865

Oh no. My gosh.

Oh gosh.

What are you doing here, Mr. Oh?

00:49:29.321 --> 00:49:31.072
No, why are you here?

00:49:33.617 --> 00:49:35.035
I saw in Hollywood action flicks…

00:49:38.872 --> 00:49:39.706
And…

00:49:43.251 --> 00:49:44.711
You need stuff like this.

00:49:47.339 --> 00:49:48.507
- I see.
- Yeah.

00:49:54.346 --> 00:49:55.180
Yeah.

00:49:56.181 --> 00:49:57.265
Thank you.

00:50:05.816 --> 00:50:07.651
I think it'd be best if I come with you.

00:50:09.653 --> 00:50:11.279
I'll call for you if I need help.

00:50:11.988 --> 00:50:14.199
Yeah? Okay.

00:51:03.039 --> 00:51:04.541
Jeez.

00:51:05.041 --> 00:51:06.209
Let's see here.

00:51:09.629 --> 00:51:12.215
This is a preview of the charges

00:51:12.924 --> 00:51:14.175
you'll be facing.

00:51:15.468 --> 00:51:16.428
CONVICTED IN INSURANCE FRAUD CASE

00:51:16.511 --> 00:51:18.763
You can't get on that plane anyway.

00:51:42.287 --> 00:51:44.414
Come on. Come at me.

00:51:45.373 --> 00:51:46.708
Come on now!

00:51:50.545 --> 00:51:53.089
Now, you'll walk back in there
and pick up the papers.

00:51:58.428 --> 00:51:59.638
It's 102 pages in total.

00:51:59.721 --> 00:52:02.557
With all that, your arrest warrant
will be out in a jiffy.

00:52:02.641 --> 00:52:04.309
You're still on probation.

00:52:04.392 --> 00:52:07.062
If you want to avoid a heavier sentence,
I suggest we wrap up here.

00:52:08.855 --> 00:52:09.689
Here.

00:52:09.773 --> 00:52:10.941
ORDER CANCELLATION AGREEMENT

00:52:14.861 --> 00:52:16.363
Sign it. Now thumbprint.

00:52:16.446 --> 00:52:17.322
But

00:52:18.031 --> 00:52:19.115
who are you anyway?

00:52:21.743 --> 00:52:25.497
I'm Hong Jang-mi from Risk Management
at Hanmin Investment & Securities.

00:52:30.752 --> 00:52:32.170
It's the order cancellation agreement.

00:52:38.635 --> 00:52:39.469
As expected, Ms. Hong.

00:52:44.015 --> 00:52:45.475
ORDER CANCELLATION AGREEMENT

00:52:45.558 --> 00:52:46.810
SIGNED: PAK KI-SOO

00:52:47.394 --> 00:52:49.270
I knew you could do it, Ms. Hong.

00:52:50.522 --> 00:52:54.859
The voicemail you left me
was very encouraging, Mr. Lee.

00:52:55.944 --> 00:52:57.696
You heard it?

00:52:58.989 --> 00:53:00.323
It's real.

00:53:00.407 --> 00:53:02.450
How did you get him to sign this?

00:53:02.534 --> 00:53:03.368
Did you do something, Big Al?

00:53:04.285 --> 00:53:05.245
Me?

00:53:05.328 --> 00:53:06.705
I just stood outside.

00:53:08.331 --> 00:53:11.543
I'd also like to submit
this supplemental report on the incident.

00:53:17.882 --> 00:53:18.758
Amazing.

00:53:24.597 --> 00:53:25.724
I can't do it.

00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:28.476
You submit it to the president yourself.

00:53:29.394 --> 00:53:30.228
Why would I?

00:53:30.311 --> 00:53:32.355
I didn't do anything,
so it feels weird to submit it.

00:53:32.439 --> 00:53:35.191
You know, in Hollywood action flicks,

00:53:35.275 --> 00:53:37.819
when the protagonist
finds themselves in danger,

00:53:37.902 --> 00:53:39.279
their partner pops out of nowhere.

00:53:39.863 --> 00:53:41.072
Just like how you did.

00:53:41.156 --> 00:53:42.991
That's what gives you
the right to submit it.

00:53:44.659 --> 00:53:46.703
"Partner"?

00:53:46.786 --> 00:53:48.705
Yes. Partner.

00:53:54.377 --> 00:53:55.879
Go on, partner.

00:54:02.177 --> 00:54:03.094
Part…

00:54:04.012 --> 00:54:04.846
Partner…

00:54:06.264 --> 00:54:07.307
Partner…

00:54:09.517 --> 00:54:10.435
Partner…

00:54:11.770 --> 00:54:12.604
Partner…

00:54:14.606 --> 00:54:17.317
- Jeez.
- You made quite an effort.

00:54:19.319 --> 00:54:21.279
Yes, because I'm a partner.

00:54:24.866 --> 00:54:28.661
As promised, can we call off
Ms. Hong's termination?

00:54:29.996 --> 00:54:32.165
We'll see how she does
during her probationary period.

00:54:34.793 --> 00:54:35.794
By the way,

00:54:35.877 --> 00:54:38.421
about the recommended improvements
at the end of the report…

00:54:38.505 --> 00:54:41.299
"The development of
an internal system that blocks orders

00:54:41.382 --> 00:54:43.968
when the selling price
falls outside the market range."

00:54:45.595 --> 00:54:49.057
Why don't we have Risk Management
spearhead that project?

00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:50.100
Pardon?

00:54:52.143 --> 00:54:53.144
Us?

00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:07.575
Why do we keep finding more work?

00:55:07.659 --> 00:55:09.911
That's what happens
when you suggest improvements.

00:55:09.994 --> 00:55:11.579
That's a basic part of a report.

00:55:12.872 --> 00:55:15.750
I was so inspired
after reading your report.

00:55:21.631 --> 00:55:25.051
Maybe the president
recognized our hidden potential?

00:55:25.135 --> 00:55:26.845
I wish he didn't.

00:55:26.928 --> 00:55:29.639
All right. That's enough work talk.

00:55:32.809 --> 00:55:34.644
The highlight of today!

00:55:37.272 --> 00:55:38.356
- Mr. Bang!
- Yeah!

00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:40.692
- Next is Mr. Lee!
- Thank you.

00:55:40.775 --> 00:55:44.112
Finally, our Ms. Hong.
Congratulations on your first paycheck.

00:55:44.195 --> 00:55:45.071
Applause!

00:55:48.491 --> 00:55:49.325
Okay.

00:55:49.909 --> 00:55:51.828
The intensity of my workload has doubled,

00:55:52.453 --> 00:55:54.289
but my paycheck has reduced by 70%.

00:55:57.709 --> 00:55:59.961
This will be the last month for pay stubs.

00:56:00.044 --> 00:56:02.088
The president wants it all digitized.

00:56:02.589 --> 00:56:04.215
You can check on the intranet from now on.

00:56:04.299 --> 00:56:05.383
How about a team dinner tonight?

00:56:05.466 --> 00:56:07.719
We should celebrate
since it's Ms. Hong's first payday.

00:56:07.802 --> 00:56:09.596
- That sounds great.
- What would you like?

00:56:09.679 --> 00:56:11.973
I'm not going. I'm clocking out now.

00:56:18.855 --> 00:56:20.481
TITLE: REPORTING SO GYEONG-DONG
TO: JW.SHIN@HANMIN.CO.KR

00:56:20.565 --> 00:56:22.192
SENDING…

00:56:22.275 --> 00:56:23.109
YOUR MAIL HAS BEEN SENT

00:56:27.822 --> 00:56:28.781
See you.

00:56:33.578 --> 00:56:34.495
Wow.

00:56:35.163 --> 00:56:37.707
Regarding what I told you
about Ms. Hong earlier,

00:56:39.125 --> 00:56:42.879
there are a few things
I would like to clarify.

00:56:43.504 --> 00:56:44.464
Go ahead.

00:56:45.673 --> 00:56:48.343
She lacks interpersonal skills
and is indeed stubborn,

00:56:48.426 --> 00:56:50.261
but she's very dedicated
when it comes to work.

00:56:50.345 --> 00:56:51.221
Is that so?

00:56:52.805 --> 00:56:54.057
The company-wide

00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:56.184
information-sharing system
you brought to my attention.

00:56:56.768 --> 00:56:58.019
Who came up with that idea?

00:56:59.604 --> 00:57:01.481
I brainstormed it with Ms. Hong Jang-mi.

00:57:02.815 --> 00:57:04.192
The brainwork was about 6:4.

00:57:04.275 --> 00:57:06.611
And of course, I was the six.

00:57:11.449 --> 00:57:15.411
You said she was also the one
who told you that I liked pizza, right?

00:57:15.495 --> 00:57:18.373
Yes, that was all her. 100%.

00:57:25.964 --> 00:57:26.798
You may leave.

00:57:36.099 --> 00:57:38.893
NEW MAIL FROM UNKNOWN:
REPORTING SO GYEONG-DONG

00:57:43.064 --> 00:57:46.484
SO GYEONG-DONG FROM TRADING HAS BEEN CLOSE
WITH ONEMILLION'S RICHARD PAK FOR YEARS

00:57:46.568 --> 00:57:48.778
{\an8}SO GYEONG-DONG POSSESSES
A SECRET SECOND CELL LINE

00:57:57.912 --> 00:57:59.247
To avoid a repeat of this mistake,

00:57:59.831 --> 00:58:01.958
the trading system will be reinforced.

00:58:02.041 --> 00:58:04.252
What about the girl who blew this up?

00:58:05.211 --> 00:58:07.922
This is different
from what you promised me.

00:58:08.006 --> 00:58:10.758
I believe we should prioritize
silencing the unnecessary rumors.

00:58:11.467 --> 00:58:12.302
Also,

00:58:12.385 --> 00:58:15.805
Division Manager Albert Oh
from Risk Management

00:58:15.888 --> 00:58:17.140
will spearhead the development.

00:58:18.182 --> 00:58:20.602
Division Manager Oh is
surprisingly ambitious

00:58:21.311 --> 00:58:22.687
and a good leader.

00:58:23.605 --> 00:58:24.522
Yes, President Shin.

00:58:25.273 --> 00:58:29.027
Sir, it's just that
Albert never had the chance.

00:58:29.110 --> 00:58:30.445
He does take after you

00:58:30.528 --> 00:58:33.239
and a bit after me, a former
Ministry of Finance and Economy official.

00:58:34.657 --> 00:58:36.159
With just a bit more experience,

00:58:36.242 --> 00:58:38.578
he'll be able to take on
harder projects without issue.

00:58:39.787 --> 00:58:42.040
They say, "Genius always shows."

00:58:42.123 --> 00:58:43.625
You must be familiar with that saying.

00:58:44.208 --> 00:58:45.918
You can all go back to work.

00:58:46.753 --> 00:58:48.212
Ms. Song, you stay.

00:58:57.805 --> 00:58:59.307
That kid…

00:59:04.103 --> 00:59:06.648
What should we do with Mr. So?

00:59:07.899 --> 00:59:11.444
I'm well aware that you've
kept him by your side and cherished him

00:59:12.362 --> 00:59:13.863
for a long time.

00:59:13.946 --> 00:59:15.823
Has So Gyeong-dong

00:59:16.449 --> 00:59:18.868
passed his expiration date as well?

00:59:21.537 --> 00:59:22.455
Sir.

00:59:24.374 --> 00:59:25.875
If you grant me the authority,

00:59:26.876 --> 00:59:30.338
I'll be sure to achieve greater results
than Mr. So without any mistakes--

00:59:30.421 --> 00:59:32.423
President Shin Jung-woo…

00:59:35.301 --> 00:59:37.929
must've figured out it was a scheme.

00:59:39.555 --> 00:59:40.973
How about President Shin…

00:59:42.684 --> 00:59:44.102
instead of General Manager So?

00:59:49.107 --> 00:59:51.234
Has President Shin caught your eye?

00:59:53.486 --> 00:59:56.698
I'm sure his studies abroad
and experience earning dollars

00:59:57.365 --> 00:59:59.534
will set him apart somehow.

01:00:02.328 --> 01:00:03.496
Also,

01:00:03.579 --> 01:00:06.791
about the figurehead CEO of Onemillion…

01:00:07.875 --> 01:00:11.295
Wrap that up for me, will you?

01:00:13.423 --> 01:00:14.298
Yes, sir.

01:00:15.591 --> 01:00:16.801
I will take care of it.

01:00:30.648 --> 01:00:32.734
Whether it's making money for investors

01:00:32.817 --> 01:00:34.777
or stealing it for the boss,

01:00:35.278 --> 01:00:37.363
you'd better do it right, moving forward.

01:00:40.867 --> 01:00:43.327
If we'd ended it
with Hong Jang-mi's disciplinary hearing,

01:00:44.412 --> 01:00:45.705
there would've been no issue.

01:00:47.248 --> 01:00:51.335
I heard that's what you told
the chairman as well.

01:00:54.130 --> 01:00:57.633
She returned with a signed agreement
cancelling the three-billion-won order.

01:00:57.717 --> 01:00:59.010
What grounds do we have left?

01:01:00.636 --> 01:01:03.014
Scrutiny and harassment
of Ms. Hong Jang-mi

01:01:03.097 --> 01:01:04.724
will no longer be tolerated.

01:01:07.226 --> 01:01:08.561
Any veteran trader knows

01:01:09.896 --> 01:01:11.147
that bad deals

01:01:11.230 --> 01:01:13.107
must be dealt with swiftly.

01:01:28.581 --> 01:01:29.624
What happened?

01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:32.585
How could you sign that?

01:01:32.668 --> 01:01:36.547
Some girl showed up with a fat file packed
with all the market manipulation evidence.

01:01:36.631 --> 01:01:38.132
She even came into the men's room.

01:01:38.216 --> 01:01:40.384
Screw that commission.

01:01:41.469 --> 01:01:42.929
I'm done working with you.

01:01:54.232 --> 01:01:56.025
- What do you want to eat?
- Let's get barbecue.

01:01:56.108 --> 01:01:57.151
Let's go all out.

01:02:03.991 --> 01:02:07.203
Why don't we call Mi-sook
and go out for dinner together?

01:02:07.286 --> 01:02:08.996
I'd like to treat you all.

01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:10.706
It's payday.

01:02:11.290 --> 01:02:13.459
Really? That sounds great.
What should we get?

01:02:13.543 --> 01:02:16.128
I wanted to head home early
because I'm so tired today.

01:02:21.843 --> 01:02:22.677
You already know, right?

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:25.137
The one treating better have a fat wallet.

01:02:26.389 --> 01:02:27.223
Of course.

01:02:51.664 --> 01:02:54.208
Did you buy that camcorder?
It looks really expensive.

01:02:58.254 --> 01:02:59.797
I'm just borrowing it.

01:02:59.881 --> 01:03:00.756
Aunt…

01:03:05.261 --> 01:03:06.470
You know where she is, right?

01:03:28.075 --> 01:03:30.161
KIMPO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

01:03:30.995 --> 01:03:32.330
It wasn't free.

01:03:33.581 --> 01:03:35.249
Nothing's free in this world.

01:03:35.833 --> 01:03:37.460
You heard me, right?
We need to eat up today.

01:03:37.543 --> 01:03:40.922
It's actually been a really long time
since I've asked someone

01:03:41.005 --> 01:03:42.173
to share a meal.

01:03:45.426 --> 01:03:46.636
Choose your dessert.

01:03:48.512 --> 01:03:49.722
I'm not surprised.

01:03:49.805 --> 01:03:51.390
You look like you have no friends.

01:04:01.067 --> 01:04:02.485
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:04:19.752 --> 01:04:21.629
The youngest shouldn't pay. Move it.

01:04:21.712 --> 01:04:22.546
How much is the total?

01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:23.881
I said I'd treat you all.

01:04:25.007 --> 01:04:26.008
Just let her.

01:04:26.092 --> 01:04:27.718
- But I can pay…
- Stop it.

01:04:29.595 --> 01:04:30.680
Thank you.

01:04:33.224 --> 01:04:34.058
Time for round two.

01:04:34.934 --> 01:04:35.768
Round two?

01:04:48.781 --> 01:04:51.742
I've never been to a rock cafe before.

01:04:53.661 --> 01:04:54.537
Me neither.

01:04:56.872 --> 01:05:00.793
Can I just head back to the dorm?

01:05:01.377 --> 01:05:03.796
I have some bible study to catch up on.

01:05:06.132 --> 01:05:10.344
The Lord will always be by our side,
but youth is always fleeting.

01:05:10.428 --> 01:05:12.346
They won't even let you in after 30.

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:15.641
Just like those geezers.

01:05:17.935 --> 01:05:18.769
Leave.

01:05:19.770 --> 01:05:22.690
Man, I'm just speechless over here.

01:05:22.773 --> 01:05:25.234
You punk, do you know who we are?

01:05:25.317 --> 01:05:27.403
How the hell would I know who you are?

01:05:28.154 --> 01:05:30.489
What? What is it? Leave.

01:05:31.073 --> 01:05:32.825
- Leave!
- What is he doing here?

01:05:32.908 --> 01:05:34.160
Scram!

01:05:34.243 --> 01:05:37.329
- Go. Get out of here. Damn it.
- Hey.

01:05:37.413 --> 01:05:38.581
- Come on.
- Leave!

01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:40.833
Hurry up and go!

01:05:46.839 --> 01:05:47.923
ONE FREE BEER

01:06:00.603 --> 01:06:01.479
Hi!

01:06:44.396 --> 01:06:45.898
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:06:53.322 --> 01:06:54.573
Should we play the truth game?

01:06:55.366 --> 01:06:57.243
If you don't answer immediately,
you drink.

01:06:58.702 --> 01:07:01.705
"I am interested in a man at work."

01:07:02.665 --> 01:07:03.707
- No.
- No!

01:07:05.167 --> 01:07:07.086
I heard the new president

01:07:07.169 --> 01:07:09.964
is totally the heartthrob of Yeouido.

01:07:10.798 --> 01:07:12.925
He's come a long way.

01:07:16.053 --> 01:07:19.098
I overheard the middle-aged men
talk smack about him at work.

01:07:19.682 --> 01:07:20.516
Right.

01:07:31.610 --> 01:07:33.529
"I have a secret spot I go to

01:07:33.612 --> 01:07:36.490
when I'm upset
and want to cry it out alone."

01:07:41.412 --> 01:07:42.746
I have so many spots…

01:07:51.547 --> 01:07:54.425
but yesterday, it was the burger place
farthest from the office.

01:07:59.722 --> 01:08:00.931
I go to the safe.

01:08:01.807 --> 01:08:04.560
Even the scary customers
can't get back there.

01:08:08.731 --> 01:08:10.524
Mine is the last bus out.

01:08:16.155 --> 01:08:19.283
They're all drunk and can't tell
if I'm crying or drooling anyway.

01:08:21.327 --> 01:08:24.163
Jang-mi, I bet you don't have one yet.
You're still just a baby.

01:08:27.041 --> 01:08:27.958
Mine is

01:08:28.834 --> 01:08:32.296
the ladies' room on the B2 floor
of the library by my parents' place.

01:08:39.094 --> 01:08:41.305
I didn't want to upset my parents
by sticking around at home,

01:08:41.388 --> 01:08:44.308
so I pretended to be busy
by going to the library every day.

01:08:44.934 --> 01:08:47.978
But sometimes,
all those emotions would choke me up.

01:08:50.189 --> 01:08:51.899
It was a long time ago.

01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:57.613
I guess the great Hanmin saved
a terrible, unemployed daughter.

01:08:58.197 --> 01:08:59.698
Come on. Let's drink.

01:08:59.782 --> 01:09:01.158
- Let's drink.
- Cheers.

01:09:05.454 --> 01:09:07.373
I found you, my peacocks!

01:09:09.124 --> 01:09:11.502
What the hell?
How did that jerk get in here?

01:09:11.585 --> 01:09:13.879
Where are you all from?
Do you want to hang out?

01:09:16.131 --> 01:09:17.341
Does he think he's a pigeon?

01:09:21.679 --> 01:09:23.555
We're college students.

01:09:29.853 --> 01:09:31.772
We're in the middle
of a serious conversation.

01:09:31.855 --> 01:09:33.399
I see. Understood.

01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:38.904
- Look at him waddling.
- Hello there.

01:09:38.988 --> 01:09:40.990
- What do you say to 4:3?
- Isn't he so ugly?

01:09:41.073 --> 01:09:42.866
Look. He just got rejected again.

01:10:39.006 --> 01:10:40.591
"We're college students."

01:10:41.925 --> 01:10:43.594
Wasn't that man so ugly?

01:10:43.677 --> 01:10:44.636
- Totally.
- Yeah.

01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:46.055
He was on the ugly side.

01:10:47.389 --> 01:10:48.223
What the hell?

01:10:48.932 --> 01:10:50.392
It's 11:45 right now.

01:10:51.518 --> 01:10:52.478
- Curfew!
- Curfew!

01:10:52.561 --> 01:10:53.771
Run!

01:10:53.854 --> 01:10:55.481
We need to hurry! Run!

01:10:56.815 --> 01:10:58.150
How would I know who she is?

01:10:58.817 --> 01:11:00.069
She had the tackiest hairstyle.

01:11:01.904 --> 01:11:03.113
I'll look for another job.

01:11:50.369 --> 01:11:51.203
Get up.

01:12:14.143 --> 01:12:15.102
Let's go to our spot.

01:12:31.743 --> 01:12:33.537
Let's just accept
our demerit points and go in.

01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:34.663
It's just one point.

01:12:34.746 --> 01:12:37.791
Hey, I'll be evicted
with one more demerit point.

01:12:38.834 --> 01:12:39.668
There's a way in.

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:51.597
How are we supposed to climb over
a 2-meter wall when we're only 160 cm?

01:12:52.306 --> 01:12:53.765
I want to try.

01:12:53.849 --> 01:12:54.892
What?

01:12:54.975 --> 01:12:55.809
Okay.

01:12:56.602 --> 01:12:58.395
The youngest should be our stepping stone.

01:12:59.229 --> 01:13:00.689
I think we can just step on that--

01:13:15.204 --> 01:13:16.371
Just step on this and climb up.

01:13:16.455 --> 01:13:17.331
Sorry.

01:13:18.874 --> 01:13:20.042
Be careful.

01:13:35.933 --> 01:13:37.768
Great. Thanks so much.

01:13:39.686 --> 01:13:40.604
Careful.

01:13:40.687 --> 01:13:42.064
Jeez. Hurry up already.

01:13:54.243 --> 01:13:55.994
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

01:14:05.754 --> 01:14:06.922
What about Jang-mi?

01:14:16.098 --> 01:14:17.057
Nice catch.

01:14:32.990 --> 01:14:34.366
It's the RA. Hide!

01:14:55.053 --> 01:14:55.971
She's gone.

01:15:08.692 --> 01:15:09.568
Good job.

01:15:14.156 --> 01:15:15.699
Thank goodness.

01:15:15.782 --> 01:15:17.659
- That was close.
- I know, right?

01:15:18.869 --> 01:15:19.995
Jang-mi was so…

01:15:27.419 --> 01:15:28.837
What happened here?

01:15:29.504 --> 01:15:31.882
We must've been robbed.

01:15:32.799 --> 01:15:34.051
Oh no.

01:15:42.517 --> 01:15:43.685
This is why

01:15:43.769 --> 01:15:46.813
you should know your place and not act up.

01:16:28.689 --> 01:16:29.856
Who's in there?

01:17:20.782 --> 01:17:22.701
{\an8}UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

01:17:23.285 --> 01:17:25.412
{\an8}I heard there is
an infiltrator in our company

01:17:25.495 --> 01:17:27.247
{\an8}- who helped blow the whistle.
- What?

01:17:27.330 --> 01:17:28.999
{\an8}- Are you hiding something?
- No.

01:17:29.082 --> 01:17:30.917
{\an8}The higher-ups are looking for Yehppee.

01:17:32.085 --> 01:17:34.796
{\an8}Both of you, bring me evidence
that proves you're innocent.

01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:37.257
{\an8}We must find out who Yehppee is first.

01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:39.134
{\an8}Is there any chance
you know how to hack too?

01:17:39.843 --> 01:17:42.846
{\an8}They might even search
the Outstanding Women Employees' Club.

01:17:42.929 --> 01:17:44.014
{\an8}The Outstanding Women Employees' Club?

01:17:44.097 --> 01:17:45.140
{\an8}And Song Ju-ran.

01:17:45.223 --> 01:17:46.183
{\an8}What about her?

01:17:46.767 --> 01:17:48.727
{\an8}I see an odd resemblance.

01:17:51.104 --> 01:17:56.109
