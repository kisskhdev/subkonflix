If you went back two years,

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.420
would you still help Lin Wan?

Your biggest achievement now

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.230
is paying the mortgage each month

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:26.420
by driving for hire.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:27.790
Look at yourself.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.590
A rich boss in others' eyes,

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.350
but a poor loser in real life.

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:32.790
This outfit you're wearing

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.500

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.110
Congratulations, Bao Xu.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:18.900
Here, let's draw the second one.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:20.740
- Win!
- Win!

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:23.020
Congratulations again, Bao Xu.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:24.020
Drawing the third one.

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.230
- Win!
- Win!

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:27.540
It's still Bao Xu.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:28.500
Mr. Pei.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.880
Bug. This program has a bug.

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:30.620
I've tested it.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:31.230
It doesn't count.

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:32.146
There's absolutely no bug.

00:09:32.146 --> 00:09:33.500
Come on, get up here.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:34.740
This is your fate.

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:36.860
Come on, Bao.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:38.110
Come.

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.990
About this trip,

00:09:41.991 --> 00:09:44.110
(Worldwide Ten-Day Trip For Two)
I've traveled enough already.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:44.830
I've decided

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:45.830
to give this prize

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:47.860
to someone who needs it more.

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.740
That person is...

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:53.740
Me.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:09:59.780
- Tang.
- Me?

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.110
Congratulations, Tang.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.830
Please come up to receive it.

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:05.110
It's you. Go on.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:06.190
Go on.

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:07.350
Go on.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.500
Here, take it.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:11.950
Tang.

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:13.380
Are you willing to accept

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.430
Bao's generous gift?

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.310
Yes.

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.740
I've never won anything.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.110
Thanks, Bao.

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:30.260
Thanks to the company.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.380
Thanks, Mr. Pei.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.780
- Nice!
- Nice!

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:35.260
Since Tang agrees,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.350
let's congratulate Tang

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:39.430
as today's lucky star.

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:44.660
For those who didn't win anything,

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:45.710
don't worry.

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:48.230
We've also booked a golf course.

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:49.430
Every employee

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:50.470
will receive

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:53.110
a golf club membership.

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:55.740
And luxury swing gifts
are waiting for you.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.380
Before heading to the golf course,

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.020
please come on stage

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.110
and take group photos in batches.

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:05.660
Come on.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.590
Yes, hold your prizes.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:16.260
Mr. Pei.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:31.990
- Mr. Pei!
- Mr. Pei!

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:40.830
Tengda Games!

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:44.070
- Infinite Passion!
- Infinite Passion!

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:57.620
Shenhua World

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:58.860
has a lot of orders today.

00:11:59.168 --> 00:12:01.391
I heard a company
is holding its annual banquet.

00:12:01.457 --> 00:12:03.020
An annual banquet at Shenhua World?

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:04.990
What company is so rich?

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:07.070
Must be an unlucky one.

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:11.900
Lu Zhiyao is impossible.

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:13.860
It's the Chinese New Year,

00:12:14.146 --> 00:12:15.620
and he wants me to revise the script.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:16.860
Impossible.

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:18.710
He's a monster.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.500
Alright, you two be careful.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.310
Lin Wan.

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:22.380
You can hold your liquor,

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:23.791
but why are you acting like Huang?

00:12:23.813 --> 00:12:25.110
I'm in a good mood.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:26.020
The car's here.

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:26.620
Come on.

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.710
Get in first.

00:12:29.657 --> 00:12:31.650
Mr. Lv, this is what you bought
at Shenhua World.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:32.880
I've packed everything for you.

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:34.070
Thanks.

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:34.430
Alright.

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:36.590
Lv, did you go on a shopping spree?

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:38.020
It's all company perks.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:40.500
It's pretty late.

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:41.620
I'll drive you two back.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.380
No need. You guys head back first.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:44.635
I've hired a designated driver.

00:12:44.635 --> 00:12:45.140
You sure?

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.140
Yeah.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:47.500
Go on.

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:50.710
Come on, Lin Wan.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:51.900
Get home safe.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:52.230
Okay.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.230
Huang, get inside.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:54.020
Close the door.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.860
Driver, lock the doors.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.020
Lin Wan.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.740
Text me on WeChat when you get home.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:12:59.740
Text me when you're home.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:00.359
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.020
See you tomorrow.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:01.900
Okay.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:09.590
Designated driver...

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:16.230
You have a new order.
Please respond promptly.

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:18.460
Another Shenhua World order?

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.620
(Instant Order)

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
Lin Wan's car...

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:32.500
Where is she?

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:37.310
Driver P.

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:41.260
Lin Wan.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
I actually came to tell you

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.140
that your destination is far.

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:46.470
Why don't you place a new order?

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:52.070
Then I'll reorder.

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:57.830
I'll place a new order.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.140
How much did you drink?

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:03.710
Not that much.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:04.900
At the annual banquet,

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:05.950
you slipped away too fast.

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:08.020
I didn't even get a drink with you.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.710
I'll take you home then.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.380
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.500
46 kilometers.

00:14:27.746 --> 00:14:30.350
After dropping you off,
I still have to head back to Four Wall.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:33.140
I'll need to swap batteries
at least three times.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:37.620
Mr. Pei.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:41.260
Thank you.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.380
Tonight,

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.740
I've wanted to tell you

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:49.470
that I'm really grateful.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:52.990
Grateful for your help

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.020
and support.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.500
Thank heavens

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.500
for giving me such a great Mr. Pei.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.260
How much did you drink?

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:09.260
People speak the truth
when they're drunk.

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:12.230
If only I'd met you earlier.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.860
What good would that have done?

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.380
Back then,

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.590
I was just a lackey at Fuhui.

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:23.140
Completely useless.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:25.740
No.

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.740
You're someone whom meeting at anytime

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:30.780
is always too late.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.590
Do you know why?

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:34.140
Why?

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:38.430
Because my name is Lin Wan.
[*Wan means "Late"]

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:54.620
Mr. Lin, Mrs. Lin.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:56.590
Sorry to trouble you

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:57.990
for bringing Wan home.

00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.590
Come in.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:59.260
This...

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:00.740
How much did she drink?

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:02.350
I didn't drink that much.

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.500
It's just that today
was the company's annual banquet,

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.230
so she probably
had a couple more drinks.

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:09.230
Mostly because
she was having fun with you.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:11.260
I'll take her upstairs now.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.230
Alright.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:16.590
Mr. Lin, I'll head out first.

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:17.020
No.

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:18.350
Come in and sit for a bit.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.260
Mr. Pei, please come in.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:26.990
Come on.

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:28.110
Have a seat.

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:31.260
It's chilly outside.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:32.590
Here, have some hot tea.

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.020
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:39.260
Your outfit...

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.660
Our company had
its annual banquet today.

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:43.950
It was cosplay.

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:45.020
Cosplay, huh?

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:46.260
Cosplay.

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:49.110
Yes.

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:50.830
Wan told us

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:52.430
you've always supported her.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.020
Especially
the Divine Mountains and Seas project.

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:56.350
That's her dream.

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:57.780
Only with you

00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.350
could that dream come true.

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.590
Her mother and I are truly grateful.

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.780
It's only right.

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.780
Only right.

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:06.390
Mr. Pei, you know,

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:07.580
in the past,

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:09.580
I wasn't very willing to let Wan

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:12.580
join a company like Tengda.

00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:13.820
But now,

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:15.500
I see I was narrow-minded.

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.580
No.

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:18.820
You were right.
How could that be narrow-minded?

00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:20.740
No, I was narrow-minded.

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:22.340
It's funny to speak of it.

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:24.780
Lately, I've noticed my colleagues,

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:28.230
clients, and even the security guards
at Shenhua Group,

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:30.302
are all playing
the Divine Mountains and Seas.

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:32.060
So I thought

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.740
this must be

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.020
the meaning behind Wan's persistence.

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:37.580
Yes.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:40.190
By the way,

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:43.230
I'm also playing
the Divine Mountains and Seas now.

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:45.060
There's a dungeon in your game.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:46.500
I've been grinding it for ages.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.680
I've playing it for days now.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:48.990
It's driving me crazy.

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:50.060
Help me take a look.

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:50.990
Lin.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:52.990
Look at the time.

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:53.780
It's late.

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:55.390
Let our daughter help you tomorrow.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.540
Let Mr. Pei get home and rest early.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:59.740
Alright.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:00.500
It's indeed late.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:01.780
Sorry.

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:03.260
Mr. Pei.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.100
Thank you for bringing Wan home.

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:06.340
Well...

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:08.780
It's late. We shouldn't keep
the driver waiting, right?

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:10.390
It's fine. I drove myself.

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:11.740
You drove yourself?

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:14.060
You didn't drink at the annual banquet?

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:17.340
I usually don't drink at all.
I'm used to it.

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:19.740
You know,

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.870
not drinking in the business world

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.500
is really rare.

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:25.990
It really is.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:27.060
It's getting late.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:27.950
I'll head off now.

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:29.060
Alright.

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:30.020
Drive safe.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:33.470
Come over for a meal sometime.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.230
Your apartment
is quite far from our place.

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.540
Yes.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:37.820
Be careful on the road.

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:38.300
I will.

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.740
Mr. Lin, Mrs. Lin, get some rest, too.

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:40.390
I'll be going now.

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.780
Alright.

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:41.740
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:57.580
Honey.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:59.230
When young people

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:00.260
cosplay,

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:01.990
do they cosplay as designated drivers?

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:06.260
Well...

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:07.710
Young people now

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:08.820
really know how to have fun.

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:15.060
Next, we'll present

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:16.190
the most anticipated

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:18.630
Company of the Year Award.

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.430
(Company of the Year Award Ceremony)
Please welcome our presenter.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.990
Honorary Partner of Dayake Group,

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:24.230
Honorary Vice President,

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:25.390
Honorary Analyst,

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:27.300
Honorary Strategic Advisor,

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.500
Honorary Doctor of St. Maria College,

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:30.740
Mr. Lawrence.

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:45.990
Well, hi, everyone.

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:46.950
We meet again.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.910
Now, I hereby announce

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:50.990
the Company of the Year goes to...

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.470
Tengda Games.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:23.710
Hello.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:26.630
Are you the one with the number 7962

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:27.870
who hired a designated driver?

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:28.950
Yep.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:31.990
Is this your car?

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:33.190
Exactly.

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:35.870
Are you

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:37.100
a foreigner?

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:42.950
I'm in a hurry.

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:52.430
You can go faster, okay?

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:54.340
Sorry about that.

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.540
This is my first time

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:57.710
being so high-profile.

00:20:58.470 --> 00:20:59.990
Relax.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:01.230
This is just one of the cars

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:03.230
I casually took out of my garage.

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:04.430
It's insured.

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:05.670
Drive without worry.

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:11.780
I see your destination
is Shenhua International Tower.

00:21:12.435 --> 00:21:13.780
Are you heading to a meeting?

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:15.710
Sorry.

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:16.780
That's

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.710
very personal.

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:20.340
Please focus

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:21.390
on your driving.

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:22.340
Okay?

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:28.020
Hi, Hailu.

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:31.100
I'm on my way to Tengda.

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.470
Yeah.

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:34.670
Change of plans.

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:36.430
It's been moved up by about a month.

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:38.340
I have an event to attend today.

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:39.950
Anyway,

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:41.540
where on earth is Pei Qian?

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:44.340
I thought I'd see him
at the awards ceremony,

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:45.540
but he didn't go.

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:47.910
Okay.

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:48.710
Call him.

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.180
(Xin Hailu, Special Assistant)

00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:59.740
Ms. Xin.

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:01.470
Hello? Mr. Pei.

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:03.340
Wherever you are,
get to the company now.

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.740
Mr. Sima's son?

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:19.430
Tengda's CEO?

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:22.540
- What's going on?
- What's going on?

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:26.710
If you two trust me,

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:27.430
I can confirm

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:29.190
there's no issue with your identities.

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:30.990
Designated driver?

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:33.540
Such a weirdo.

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:37.740
Explain.

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:39.230
It's like this.

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:40.670
Designated driver

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:42.910
is just my hobby

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:44.020
outside of work.

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:45.430
I'm experiencing life.

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:48.950
He's really Mr. Sima's son?

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:49.910
Are you sure?

00:22:51.102 --> 00:22:52.990
If you don't believe it,
check it yourself.

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:03.340
(Sima Fu)

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:07.100
Mr. Sima Fu.

00:23:08.924 --> 00:23:10.300
Let me reintroduce myself.

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:12.020
You can call me Lawrence.

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:13.780
It sounds friendlier.

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:15.710
Hello, Mr. Law.

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:16.780
May I ask

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.430
why you're here at Tengda?

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:20.670
Well.

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:22.190
I appreciate your bluntness.

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:23.150
Anyway,

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:25.430
you may not have heard of me,

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:26.670
but I often hear Daddy

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:27.540
mention you.

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:28.230
He

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:29.540
admires you a lot.

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:32.710
I'm here this time on his suggestion.

00:23:32.724 --> 00:23:33.820
I'm here to manage Tengda

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:35.060
with you.

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:37.990
Manage Tengda

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:39.390
with me?

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:41.470
Anyway...

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:44.500
What's going on?

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:51.990
Ms. Xin.

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:54.540
Can I have a call with Mr. Sima?

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:56.260
He's abroad recently.

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:57.390
It's not convenient.

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:08.020
I've already given up

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:09.170
on my contract with Mr. Sima,

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:11.190
but now he sends his son here.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:12.300
What is he trying to do?

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:14.950
My analysis is

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:17.190
that he probably just wants Lawrence

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:18.470
to gain experience at Tengda.

00:24:18.568 --> 00:24:19.540
He can gain experience.

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:21.150
Just don't use me for it.

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:22.630
Or I'll settle it with him.

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:28.020
That's all?

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:30.390
Daddy once said

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:31.870
Tengda was a treasure.

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:33.870
Now it seems nothing special.

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:35.580
Your businesses...

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.910
It doesn't make sense.

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:39.820
Should I leave?

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:42.340
No, you can't.

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:43.390
If you leave

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:44.670
and Daddy finds out,

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:45.670
he won't be happy.

00:24:46.635 --> 00:24:48.150
I've actually thought it through.

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:50.470
I won't interfere

00:24:50.524 --> 00:24:51.880
with Tengda's existing projects.

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:53.568
But I want to start a new business line.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:54.910
You must cooperate,

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:56.060
but can't interfere.

00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:58.260
That's not a problem.

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:00.260
Let me ask something unrelated.

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:01.580
What exactly is your dad doing?

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:02.950
When is he coming back?

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:04.430
That's Daddy's business.

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:06.910
Anyway,

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:08.670
at the end of the day,

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:09.630
it was Daddy

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:10.740
who gave you the chance

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:12.230
to make you the one in charge.

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:15.710
Stop asking so much.

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:16.500
Okay?

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:30.060
What is this brief Mr. Law sent?

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:31.470
A brief?

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:33.100
What is he even saying here?

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:36.190
Mr. Law is impossible.

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:37.146
He wants me

00:25:37.146 --> 00:25:39.540
to come up with a complete game proposal
within a week.

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:40.524
How is that possible?

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:40.910
No.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:43.230
Who has time to help me
pick an English name?

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:44.990
I haven't submitted mine yet.

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:47.340
Just translate it directly from Chinese.

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:48.910
Bo calls himself Yellow.

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:50.190
You can be Bright.

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:50.990
Bright.

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:51.710
Sounds good.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:52.820
We have Night there.

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:56.100
Mr. Ma, what's yours?

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:57.630
I'm Horse.

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:01.950
At least, call yourself Ocean.

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:05.710
It's all messed up.

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:06.990
Mr. Pei said this Mr. Law

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:08.260
is Tengda's investor.

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:09.702
We should all try to tolerate him.

00:26:09.791 --> 00:26:12.120
But no matter how I look,
he doesn't seem like an investor.

00:26:12.124 --> 00:26:14.500
He's more like
the business version of Lu Zhiyao.

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:15.430
Ocean.

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:18.230
Ocean is good.

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:22.300
Mr. Pei said

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:23.710
we don't need to deal with Lawrence.

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:24.710
He promised

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:26.870
not to interfere
with Tengda's current projects.

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:29.020
Isn't that good news?

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:29.990
Come on, have a drink.

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.740
Everyone.

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:32.740
Good news.

00:26:32.902 --> 00:26:35.613
But no matter how I look,
he doesn't seem like an investor.

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:41.580
(Shenhua International)

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:54.710
Yeah.

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:56.580
Actually,

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:57.580
I'm sensitive

00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:58.910
to marketing trends.

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:00.780
I don't know if you've been following

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:02.540
advertising trends recently.

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:03.740
Anyway,

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:06.260
the traditional ad industry
is declining.

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:07.430
With the same budget,

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:09.780
users would rather hire ten influencers

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:11.500
than make ads.

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:13.500
Mr. Law.

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:16.230
You taking over my office is fine.

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:17.990
I don't come back often, anyway.

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:21.060
But Tengda isn't about online marketing.

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:22.870
It's

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:24.190
e-marketing.

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:26.470
These past two days,

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:28.470
I've been doing serious research.

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:29.470
I found

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:30.710
Tengda

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:32.260
has a lot of potential.

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:34.150
It has some internet presence,

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:36.190
but you never really focused on it.

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:37.990
Such a pity.

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:39.230
Mr. Law.

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:40.260
I know

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:42.020
there are a lot
of marketing, influencers,

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:42.740
and so on.

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:44.910
But Tengda doesn't have that foundation.

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:46.260
What do you mean no foundation?

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:48.150
Isn't Ocean an influencer?

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:50.630
Ocean?

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:51.540
Who's that?

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:52.820
Mr. Ma.

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:54.790
That's what I'm talking about.

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:56.950
Anyway,

00:27:57.168 --> 00:27:58.470
do you have an English name?

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:01.230
Calling you Mr. Pei

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:02.500
sounds too old-fashioned.

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:04.340
Everyone likes English names nowadays.

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:05.870
Just like a family.

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:09.020
Then...

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:10.580
Then call me

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:12.710
Loss.

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:13.990
Loss?

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:15.990
Interesting.

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.870
It sounds a bit weird,

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:20.910
but you're Loss,

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.150
and I'm Lawrence.

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:23.430
Match.

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:25.230
Okay.

00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:25.950
Loss.

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:28.190
Ocean's "Dreams Fulfilled Immediately"

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:29.260
will be upgraded

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:30.500
in the live format.

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:33.260
As the new section I manage at Tengda,

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.146
it will maximize his value
as an influencer.

00:28:35.168 --> 00:28:36.610
First gain popularity, then lead it.

00:28:36.613 --> 00:28:38.060
Finally, make Tengda

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.230
a traffic industrial park.

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:41.150
Fly high, Tengda.

00:28:58.540 --> 00:28:59.260
Mr. Law.

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:01.500
Do we really need to do this live?

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:05.230
Ocean.

00:29:05.746 --> 00:29:07.191
The live streaming industry

00:29:07.213 --> 00:29:08.340
is already saturated.

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:09.740
If you don't do this,

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:11.630
how will your personal IP stand out?

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.910
Anyway,

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:14.430
our target audience

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:16.150
is focused
on young and middle-aged women.

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:17.300
Beauty products

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:18.740
are definitely the first choice.

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:19.230
The logo

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:20.020

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.740
are all designed based on this.

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:22.740
Understand?

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:24.500
But I've never heard of these brands.

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:25.780
Will this work, Mr. Law?

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.100
Don't look down

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:28.020
on startup brands.

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:30.060
Making a profit for the company

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.470
is what makes sense.

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:32.100
Okay?

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:33.500
Okay.

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:37.500
We're okay too.

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:38.950
So what are we waiting for?

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:40.820

He's very adaptable.

Mr. Law, any ideas?

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:34.630
I'm worried

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:35.870
that Loss might face

00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:37.260
many challenges during filming.

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:38.710

How about this?

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:42.740
You, I, and Ocean

Mr. Pei.

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:05.100
I heard Mr. Law

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:06.580
wants Mr. Ma to do live sales.

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:07.870
Today is the first day.

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:12.910
Ma has it tough.

00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:13.870
Mainly because Mr. Law

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:15.260
is hard to control.

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:16.430
Mr. Pei.

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:18.630
What exactly is Mr. Law's background?

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:20.230
Business-wise,

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:22.230
I can't explain in a sentence or two.

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:25.020
Just endure it for now.

00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:26.540
But he also promised us

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:28.540
he won't interfere
with other Tengda businesses.

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:33.020
Let's wait and see.

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:34.500
Sibo.

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:35.950

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:40.340
I almost forgot

00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:42.300
you're still
in charge of Feihuang Pictures.

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:43.820
Mr. Pei.

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:45.430
This is what I should do.

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:46.946
Besides, no matter how hard we work,

00:31:46.946 --> 00:31:48.300
it's not as hard as your driving.

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:49.470
I really didn't expect

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:51.230
you could keep this up for so long.

Mr. Law and Mr. Ma will visit the set.

00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:05.780
he won't handle other Tengda matters?

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:07.470
Tang also said

00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:08.990
she sent some special requests

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:10.500
from Mr. Law in advance.
