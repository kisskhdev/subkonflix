00:00:34.617 --> 00:00:37.954
{\an8}UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:43.168
Who's Hong Keum-bo?

00:00:44.502 --> 00:00:46.963
"Hong Jang-mi's Outfit Inspiration Book
for a 20-Year-Old."

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:49.883
From Hong Jang-mi.
To my sister, Hong Keum-bo.

00:00:57.682 --> 00:00:59.267
Why are you digging through my stuff?

00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:00.685
Wait. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:02.353 --> 00:01:03.730
I know that face.

00:01:12.363 --> 00:01:14.407
She's the top exam scorer
in the written exam.

00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:16.034
We all met during the interview.

00:01:16.117 --> 00:01:17.285
Right.

00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:21.289
"Please conduct a thorough review
of exam questions next time."

00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:27.170
Your boxes fell apart
after they got soaked in the rain.

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:29.881
I hauled all those soggy boxes,
and you treat me like a thief.

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:32.342
I can't believe kids nowadays.

00:01:40.683 --> 00:01:41.518
Sit!

00:01:42.227 --> 00:01:44.521
You need to choose rooms
and clean all this stuff up.

00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:56.491
Introduce yourselves.

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:58.576
You start.

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:08.920
Keum-bo.

00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:10.839
Greetings are crucial.

00:02:11.422 --> 00:02:14.259
You can't say hello
like a jaded 35-year-old

00:02:14.342 --> 00:02:15.677
who's had enough of this world.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.220
A 20-year-old should sound like…

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:21.516
Do, re, mi, fa, sol…

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.643
That's it. Sol.

00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:27.772
Do, re, mi, fa, sol…

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:30.733
It's nice to meet you. I'm Hong Jang-mi.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:34.946
I start work at Hanmin's head office
in Yeouido tomorrow.

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:37.574
I turned 20

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:39.117
this year.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.333
Did you say 20?

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:48.960
You look so old though.

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:52.172
Like I said, I'm 20 years old.

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:53.089
What about you?

00:02:53.172 --> 00:02:54.257
I'm Go Bok-hee.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.135
I've worked everywhere
from first-tier banks to securities firms,

00:02:57.218 --> 00:02:59.804
and I'm currently an assistant
at Hanmin's head office in Yeouido.

00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:00.805
I'm 29.

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:02.473
Next.

00:03:04.392 --> 00:03:06.394
Hello. I'm Kang No…

00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:09.188
Eun-joo.

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:10.607
I'm 25.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.233
I'll also be working
in the Yeouido office.

00:03:13.067 --> 00:03:15.069
So everyone's at the main office.

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:18.907
Hello. I'm Kim Mi-sook.

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:23.119
I work as a teller at the Magang Branch
of Hanmin Investment & Securities.

00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:24.245
How old are you?

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.955
I'm 28.

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.791
What? I'm the oldest one here?

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:30.126
I'm the queen bee?

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:33.504
You are.

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:41.095
I use that big room over there,
so decide among yourselves.

00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:45.516
Who will be my roommate?

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.101
Me.

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:48.311
I'll use the big room with you.

00:03:50.813 --> 00:03:52.398
Mi-sook, I was hoping you--

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:53.900
Let's play it fair.
First-come, first-served.

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:02.325
See you later.

00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:04.369
I hope we get along.

00:04:08.122 --> 00:04:10.124
I can't stand the kids nowadays!

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.337
{\an8}SEOUL CITY DORMITORY
FOR SINGLE FEMALE WORKERS

00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:39.821
Wow.

00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:48.329
I guess you really like stuffed animals.

00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:49.247
I really do.

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:52.667
I lived in a dorm when I was in school.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.712
Being surrounded by things you like
makes dorm life easier to endure.

00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:02.260
Do you want to say hi?

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:05.013
These are Rachel, Phoebe,

00:05:06.347 --> 00:05:07.473
and Chandler.

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:09.309
"Hi!"

00:05:19.902 --> 00:05:21.195
I should shower too.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.214
We got this.

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:45.219
JEMULPO GIRLS' COMMERCIAL HIGH SCHOOL

00:05:58.483 --> 00:05:59.776
Let's go with pink.

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:01.360
My makeup academy instructor told me

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:04.030
that one's public image
can be decided by color alone.

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.949
If you feel like
you're looking a bit matronly,

00:06:07.742 --> 00:06:09.368
just go all pink.

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:22.090
I'll befriend her

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.177
and then ask who President Kang
was closely acquainted with.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.931
Shall I first find
some common ground to start?

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:40.149
Wow.

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:42.193
Bok-hee, is that Gwangalli Beach?

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.489
That's Santa Monica Beach.

00:06:47.865 --> 00:06:49.784
That's in LA, right? In the US.

00:06:49.867 --> 00:06:51.619
I'm going to move there.

00:06:53.162 --> 00:06:54.122
I promised myself

00:06:54.747 --> 00:06:56.707
when I was around your age.

00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:05.842
{\an8}SANTA MONICA!
COME TO SANTA MONICA!

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:17.854
EXPRESS BUS TICKET
ANEON TO POSAN, MAY 1, 1988

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.361
Mom! Dad!

00:07:26.195 --> 00:07:28.030
- My sweet daughter!
- Mom. Dad.

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:30.116
- Happy birthday, kid.
- Have you been well?

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:31.868
It must've been a long journey.
Let's go home.

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:33.119
I'll make tasty food for you.

00:07:33.202 --> 00:07:34.912
I'm so hungry.

00:07:42.753 --> 00:07:46.966
A SPECIAL SUMMER VACATION ABROAD
SANTA MONICA!

00:07:47.049 --> 00:07:51.179
{\an8}"IN ROMANTIC LA, UNDER THE CALIFORNIA SUN!
SANTA MONICA BEACH"

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:00.730
I promised myself

00:08:01.647 --> 00:08:05.151
that I'd spend my 30th birthday
on Santa Monica Beach in LA.

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:09.489
{\an8}SANTA MONICA!

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:16.996
You'll need to make lots of money then.

00:08:17.705 --> 00:08:20.124
You'll probably need about
a million dollars for the investor visa.

00:08:21.417 --> 00:08:23.628
I'll become Million-Dollar Go Bok-hee.

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:27.548
By the way,
you need to clean the room every day.

00:08:28.132 --> 00:08:30.426
I can't stand to look at
dust and hair rolling around

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.136
like tumbleweeds.

00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:35.598
I can't stand them, either,

00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:36.807
Bok-hee.

00:08:56.494 --> 00:08:57.870
Quite sensitive.

00:08:57.954 --> 00:08:59.038
Clean.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:00.873
US-obsessed.

00:09:08.756 --> 00:09:10.967
EPISODE 2:
BETWEEN RECRUITMENT AND INFILTRATION

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.693
{\an8}How could I work at that office?

00:09:28.776 --> 00:09:30.653
{\an8}Just remember one thing.

00:09:31.153 --> 00:09:34.574
{\an8}Just find the cleverest, sharpest one
and stick by them, no matter what.

00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:35.491
{\an8}Got it?

00:09:37.368 --> 00:09:39.203
{\an8}Someone clever and sharp…

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:42.373
{\an8}Thank you, Jang-mi.

00:09:44.041 --> 00:09:45.960
{\an8}HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

00:09:49.046 --> 00:09:51.132
Right. I'm Hong Jang-mi.

00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:55.094
I'm a 20-year-old entry-level minion,
Hong Jang-mi.

00:10:00.349 --> 00:10:02.685
ETIQUETTE REINFORCEMENT TRAINING
FOR FEMALE EMPLOYEES

00:10:23.914 --> 00:10:26.792
New members of the Hanmin family,
it's nice to meet you all.

00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:29.045
I'm Song Ju-ran, the Chief of Staff.

00:10:34.508 --> 00:10:36.177
After the morning training,

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.971
you will each be assigned
to your departments.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.892
Please check the personnel appointment
on the bulletin board later on.

00:10:42.975 --> 00:10:45.353
And it's nothing grand,

00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:48.397
but we've prepared
welcome gifts for you all.

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:53.110
{\an8}101 THINGS YOU MUST DO IN YOUR TWENTIES

00:11:05.039 --> 00:11:07.124
101 THINGS YOU MUST DO IN YOUR TWENTIES

00:11:07.208 --> 00:11:08.959
Who has time for 101 things?

00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:21.222
Ms. Go Bok-hee here
will lead the morning training.

00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:24.350
Here's to an uplifting corporate life
for all of you.

00:11:24.433 --> 00:11:26.852
Let's all give it our best shot.
You got this!

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:28.020
- We got this!
- We got this!

00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:29.939
You got this.

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:42.701
All entry-level female employees
in the head office and all branches

00:11:42.785 --> 00:11:44.787
wear the same uniform.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:48.124
Women's locker rooms
are available for wardrobe changes.

00:11:49.083 --> 00:11:49.917
Wardrobe?

00:11:50.709 --> 00:11:51.836
A robe like hanbok?

00:11:52.586 --> 00:11:56.048
Wardrobe as in what you're wearing,
so changing in and out of the uniform.

00:11:56.632 --> 00:11:58.843
I see. You're so smart.

00:12:02.304 --> 00:12:06.100
You can change into your uniforms
during the ten-minute break.

00:12:06.183 --> 00:12:07.643
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:12:08.227 --> 00:12:09.103
Right.

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:32.835
Long hair must be pulled back
without flyaways

00:12:32.918 --> 00:12:34.044
and finished with a neat hair net.

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:37.548
Tights should be at least 30 denier.

00:12:38.757 --> 00:12:40.551
Tights? It's still so hot outside.

00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:42.720
That's right.

00:12:42.803 --> 00:12:44.680
You're the only one
without them right now.

00:12:53.564 --> 00:12:56.859
At Hanmin, we believe in the 119 Campaign.

00:12:57.443 --> 00:12:59.403
During company dinners,
we drink one type of alcohol,

00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:00.446
for one round only,

00:13:01.113 --> 00:13:02.490
and wrap up by nine.

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:06.619
Those of you overseeing expense reports
should take special note.

00:13:06.702 --> 00:13:07.870
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:13:08.662 --> 00:13:10.206
What should we have for lunch?

00:13:11.749 --> 00:13:14.043
Next, we'll discuss meeting protocols.

00:13:21.175 --> 00:13:23.135
Jang-mi, I got this.

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:25.513
My mom gave me extra spending money
to treat my colleagues…

00:13:26.722 --> 00:13:27.848
Save your money.

00:13:28.516 --> 00:13:30.142
It's expensive to live in Seoul,

00:13:30.893 --> 00:13:31.810
Eun-joo.

00:13:36.565 --> 00:13:38.317
No one has ever told me

00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:40.611
to save my money.

00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:42.363
Are you ready to order?

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:44.698
You want the bulgogi sandwich?

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:46.659
We'll take three.

00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:55.000
I'll naturally treat Go Bok-hee to lunch

00:13:55.084 --> 00:13:56.544
and get on her good side.

00:14:00.714 --> 00:14:02.508
Have you no respect for your senior?

00:14:05.594 --> 00:14:08.013
You dare to talk smack about me
behind my back?

00:14:08.097 --> 00:14:10.266
Isn't speaking with tact
a basic assistant virtue?

00:14:10.808 --> 00:14:13.352
Who says the new president
will have a new assistant?

00:14:13.435 --> 00:14:16.939
We have degrees in secretarial studies
from four-year universities.

00:14:17.022 --> 00:14:20.192
If anything, we're more well-versed
in assistant virtues.

00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:24.280
A teller from a regional branch
becomes the president's assistant

00:14:24.947 --> 00:14:26.240
and thinks she's one herself.

00:14:26.323 --> 00:14:28.492
- What?
- It's no wonder people thought

00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:30.202
you were President Kang's "companion."

00:14:30.286 --> 00:14:32.788
The rumors began because
that seemed like the only explanation.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.752
So the rat responsible
for those vulgar rumors

00:14:39.253 --> 00:14:40.379
was you.

00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:46.343
Oh no.

00:14:46.427 --> 00:14:49.305
You'd better let go of me right now!

00:14:49.388 --> 00:14:51.223
- Let go of her.
- Stop it.

00:14:52.433 --> 00:14:53.851
Who are you, country bumpkins?

00:14:53.934 --> 00:14:55.102
Country bumpkins?

00:14:55.185 --> 00:14:56.145
Oh my gosh.

00:14:56.228 --> 00:14:57.521
She cursed me out.

00:14:58.272 --> 00:15:01.567
Let's not resort to name-calling.
We're all educated women here.

00:15:03.444 --> 00:15:05.237
As if you all are "educated."

00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:07.531
You're just entry-level minions
with commercial high school diplomas.

00:15:12.369 --> 00:15:15.080
I've never been so disrespected
and belittled in my life.

00:15:15.164 --> 00:15:16.916
You, lock the door.

00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:18.167
- Okay.
- What?

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:19.418
Wait. Why are you locking the door?

00:15:19.501 --> 00:15:20.711
- Why…
- You stay right there.

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:26.842
Like this!

00:15:30.721 --> 00:15:33.057
- Bok-hee!
- Bok-hee, are you okay?

00:15:50.074 --> 00:15:51.033
Let go!

00:15:51.116 --> 00:15:53.285
- You'd better let go of me!
- You let go.

00:15:53.369 --> 00:15:55.955
Let go. Let go of me right now!

00:15:56.038 --> 00:15:58.248
Jang-mi!

00:15:58.332 --> 00:15:59.375
Get up!

00:16:00.042 --> 00:16:01.126
Wake up!

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:04.046
Jang-mi!

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:12.304
I went easy on you!
You'd better thank your lucky stars!

00:16:17.101 --> 00:16:17.935
Jang-mi.

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:20.062
Are you okay?

00:16:20.646 --> 00:16:21.897
What if she got a concussion?

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:23.983
Embarrassment doesn't cause concussions.

00:16:27.027 --> 00:16:28.028
Get up.

00:16:35.369 --> 00:16:36.578
Mind your business from now on.

00:16:44.503 --> 00:16:45.546
Jang-mi.

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.297
How many fingers do you see?

00:17:01.603 --> 00:17:03.147
Why is she so strong?

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:04.523
{\an8}FOR FEMALE EMPLOYEES ONLY
DISCIPLINARY ACTION FOR VIOLATIONS

00:17:11.071 --> 00:17:12.906
Jang-mi, are you all right?

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:14.033
Yeah, sure.

00:17:14.116 --> 00:17:16.410
The assignments were posted.
We're both on the seventh floor.

00:17:16.493 --> 00:17:19.538
I'm assigned to Trading,
and you're in Risk Management.

00:17:20.122 --> 00:17:21.331
Risk Management?

00:17:27.755 --> 00:17:30.132
RISK MANAGEMENT, RESEARCH,
CONFERENCE ROOM

00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:33.427
Is Research under Risk Management?

00:17:39.433 --> 00:17:42.269
MANAGER LEE YONG-GI
RISK MANAGEMENT, PHD IN ENGINEERING

00:17:44.646 --> 00:17:46.690
Are you Ms. Hong, the new hire?

00:17:47.483 --> 00:17:48.317
Yes.

00:17:49.151 --> 00:17:50.027
Shall we?

00:18:28.065 --> 00:18:29.066
We need to go a bit farther.

00:18:44.665 --> 00:18:46.041
RISK MANAGEMENT DIVISION

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:49.294
This is it.

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:02.766
Hey.

00:19:06.061 --> 00:19:08.230
Do, re, mi, fa, sol…

00:19:08.313 --> 00:19:09.648
Hello.

00:19:09.731 --> 00:19:11.692
I'm Hong Jang-mi.

00:19:12.693 --> 00:19:13.777
Oh no!

00:19:14.278 --> 00:19:15.112
{\an8}RISK MANAGEMENT DIVISION
DIVISION MANAGER ALBERT OH

00:19:20.617 --> 00:19:21.618
I didn't know

00:19:22.286 --> 00:19:23.954
this was lodged in there.

00:19:24.538 --> 00:19:26.373
I paid a week's worth of late fees.

00:19:26.456 --> 00:19:30.043
I've repeatedly told the cleaning staff
not to clean my desk.

00:19:30.127 --> 00:19:33.630
How could they not clean
the division manager's desk?

00:19:33.714 --> 00:19:36.175
Just let it go
and say hello to the new hire.

00:19:39.928 --> 00:19:41.054
Is it that guy…

00:19:42.306 --> 00:19:43.765
TO YOU FROM ME

00:19:47.519 --> 00:19:49.146
…who took To You from Me?

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:52.774
{\an8}I swear it's not late

00:19:53.317 --> 00:19:55.319
because I watched one particular scene

00:19:56.278 --> 00:19:57.529
over and over.

00:19:58.197 --> 00:19:59.156
Watch it.

00:19:59.239 --> 00:20:01.992
She just turned 20 and is barely an adult,

00:20:02.075 --> 00:20:03.493
even if she looks a bit old.

00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:26.016
Oh right. What's the new president's name?

00:20:26.642 --> 00:20:27.476
No idea.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:29.978
They want us at his appointment ceremony.

00:20:31.521 --> 00:20:32.481
We'll find out then.

00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:36.735
HANMIN PRESIDENT SHIN JUNG-WOO
APPOINTMENT CEREMONY

00:20:40.822 --> 00:20:41.782
Hey, over here.

00:20:48.163 --> 00:20:50.165
PRESIDENT SHIN JUNG-WOO

00:20:50.249 --> 00:20:51.208
Kid!

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.753
Entry-level female staff
should sit in the back.

00:21:03.845 --> 00:21:05.097
Jang-mi, over here.

00:21:08.725 --> 00:21:09.851
Why that little…

00:21:28.078 --> 00:21:28.912
This way.

00:21:35.043 --> 00:21:37.838
Please welcome President Shin Jung-woo.

00:21:56.815 --> 00:21:57.733
Hello.

00:21:58.317 --> 00:22:01.028
I'm the newest member
of Hanmin Investment & Securities,

00:22:01.111 --> 00:22:02.154
Shin Jung-woo.

00:22:06.533 --> 00:22:10.120
Hanmin is, in name and reality,
a first-rate company that has led

00:22:10.203 --> 00:22:11.330
Korea's financial industry.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:15.334
However, the times are demanding change.

00:22:23.842 --> 00:22:24.968
What do you want to eat later?

00:22:27.054 --> 00:22:27.929
Jang-mi?

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.720
Act natural.

00:23:09.304 --> 00:23:11.598
There's nothing natural about you.
Aren't you hot?

00:23:15.185 --> 00:23:17.312
The new president showed up today, right?

00:23:19.356 --> 00:23:20.190
Director Yun,

00:23:20.273 --> 00:23:22.234
is our intel-gathering prowess
really that limited?

00:23:22.317 --> 00:23:24.236
If I'd known
that Shin Jung-woo would be joining,

00:23:24.319 --> 00:23:27.155
I'd never have set foot in Hanmin,
undercover my ass.

00:23:28.406 --> 00:23:29.324
You know him?

00:23:32.077 --> 00:23:33.912
We were on the same team
at my old accounting firm,

00:23:35.038 --> 00:23:36.498
college alums before that, and…

00:23:38.458 --> 00:23:40.377
And shared a passionate romance?

00:23:41.378 --> 00:23:42.504
It was passionate…

00:23:43.463 --> 00:23:44.381
No.

00:23:44.464 --> 00:23:46.174
It was nothing but pure.

00:23:51.596 --> 00:23:54.391
{\an8}12 YEARS AGO, 1985

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:24.796
FINANCIAL SUPERVISORY SERVICE CPA

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:29.885
Jung-woo.

00:24:29.968 --> 00:24:32.512
Keum-bo, congratulations on passing.

00:24:37.976 --> 00:24:39.102
Jung-woo.

00:24:40.896 --> 00:24:42.564
Keum-bo, look at this.

00:24:43.148 --> 00:24:45.734
THE TOP SCORER WAS
MS. HONG KEUM-BO, 23, SEOUN UNIVERSITY

00:24:45.817 --> 00:24:48.445
You should dress warmer.

00:24:49.112 --> 00:24:50.030
I'm fine.

00:24:51.364 --> 00:24:53.992
But what about you?

00:24:55.035 --> 00:24:55.911
There.

00:24:55.994 --> 00:24:57.245
I also passed.

00:24:58.747 --> 00:25:00.582
I'm so proud of my boyfriend.

00:25:01.124 --> 00:25:02.584
Congratulations, Shin Jung-woo.

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:09.591
I'm so happy.

00:25:10.926 --> 00:25:11.760
Congratulations.

00:25:11.843 --> 00:25:12.928
Congratulations.

00:25:21.978 --> 00:25:23.271
Ms. Hong.

00:25:23.355 --> 00:25:25.232
Please review the information at the top.

00:25:31.863 --> 00:25:33.114
STAR CONSTRUCTION, MARCH INVOICE
FROM MARCH 1ST-31ST, 1987

00:25:58.181 --> 00:26:01.893
How many times have you seen the head
of the Financial Supervisory Service?

00:26:03.103 --> 00:26:05.438
What are the chances
of an entry-level female employee

00:26:05.522 --> 00:26:07.983
running into the president
on the top floor?

00:26:09.067 --> 00:26:09.901
Low, right?

00:26:11.194 --> 00:26:12.612
How's the department?

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:15.824
The Risk Management Division
has an impressive name,

00:26:15.907 --> 00:26:18.743
but it's just a hole in the wall
inside the Research Division office.

00:26:20.036 --> 00:26:21.413
Albert Oh, the division manager,

00:26:21.496 --> 00:26:23.039
is Executive Director Oh Deok-gyu's son.

00:26:23.123 --> 00:26:24.666
Man, he's already a division manager?

00:26:26.293 --> 00:26:28.003
It must be nice
to be the chairman's grandson.

00:26:28.086 --> 00:26:30.338
I thought I might
get something out of him,

00:26:31.298 --> 00:26:33.466
but he's just a clueless
25-year-old silver spoon kid.

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:34.884
He's a good-for-nothing loafer.

00:26:37.721 --> 00:26:41.057
I heard he was secretly studying film
in the US before being dragged back.

00:26:41.141 --> 00:26:43.101
He just spends all day
in the office watching movies.

00:26:47.689 --> 00:26:50.150
Bang Jin-mok,
Yehppee Candidate 2, is no better.

00:26:51.443 --> 00:26:53.820
The office for that perpetual manager is

00:26:53.903 --> 00:26:55.613
just a comic book store that pays him.

00:26:57.866 --> 00:26:59.951
Manager Lee has a PhD in engineering

00:27:00.035 --> 00:27:01.786
and he's the cyber banking developer.

00:27:02.829 --> 00:27:05.623
He spends all day coding
when he works at a securities firm.

00:27:07.417 --> 00:27:09.127
That office is a hot mess.

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:10.587
No one works there.

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:12.922
Ridiculous. You shouldn't, either.

00:27:13.006 --> 00:27:15.717
How dare they do that
in front of a Financial Supervisory ace?

00:27:17.844 --> 00:27:20.513
Befriend that assistant
and just get the intel you need.

00:27:20.597 --> 00:27:21.848
Then focus on finding Yehppee.

00:27:22.474 --> 00:27:23.308
Okay.

00:27:23.808 --> 00:27:26.811
Director, you dig into
Go Bok-hee some more and report back.

00:27:27.395 --> 00:27:29.981
Find out what her reputation was
at her previous job as well.

00:27:30.982 --> 00:27:33.818
"Look into Go Bok-hee's reputation."

00:27:51.461 --> 00:27:54.964
Nora has been assigned
to the Trading Division as you requested.

00:27:55.632 --> 00:27:56.549
Is that so?

00:27:57.550 --> 00:27:59.177
How long do you think she'll last?

00:27:59.969 --> 00:28:03.640
You offered her a 9% stake in the company
after three months.

00:28:04.808 --> 00:28:06.393
Even if Nora wants to give up,

00:28:07.352 --> 00:28:09.437
there's no way Madam Choi will let her.

00:28:09.521 --> 00:28:13.149
Why don't you lend her a hand as well?

00:28:14.401 --> 00:28:17.445
Unfortunately, she takes after her mother.

00:28:18.571 --> 00:28:21.157
She could use some support.

00:28:21.991 --> 00:28:23.743
Who could be more qualified than you?

00:28:25.036 --> 00:28:27.664
Check in on her at the office and the dorm

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:30.125
whenever you have a spare moment.

00:28:32.127 --> 00:28:33.378
I will, sir.

00:28:33.962 --> 00:28:34.796
Good.

00:28:38.299 --> 00:28:40.510
Hello. Come in.

00:28:40.593 --> 00:28:42.679
- I'll leave you two to talk.
- All right.

00:28:46.433 --> 00:28:48.476
One day,

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:53.148
we'll be able to trade stocks anywhere
as long as we have a computer.

00:28:54.524 --> 00:28:56.985
Myeong-hwi used to
talk about that as well.

00:29:01.406 --> 00:29:04.951
I'm talking about my son.

00:29:07.454 --> 00:29:08.371
I see.

00:29:08.455 --> 00:29:10.498
That should cut labor costs.

00:29:11.166 --> 00:29:12.584
How much do you think they'll drop?

00:29:13.668 --> 00:29:17.756
I haven't done the exact calculations yet.

00:29:17.839 --> 00:29:21.676
All right.
We can crunch the numbers as we go.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:26.431
There are two things I want to ask of you

00:29:27.015 --> 00:29:28.141
as the new president.

00:29:28.224 --> 00:29:29.184
First,

00:29:30.143 --> 00:29:31.853
I'd like you to turn around

00:29:32.604 --> 00:29:36.191
the unrest inside the company
since the prosecution's investigation.

00:29:38.067 --> 00:29:39.235
Second,

00:29:40.153 --> 00:29:45.200
there has been a lot of talk
about the Hanmin heir.

00:29:46.659 --> 00:29:50.246
I may have a daughter,

00:29:51.414 --> 00:29:52.707
but if it's all the same,

00:29:53.625 --> 00:29:55.585
a boy will be better.

00:29:56.878 --> 00:30:01.466
I wish to have my grandson be my heir…

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:05.595
but he still has a long way to go.

00:30:06.387 --> 00:30:07.722
His father is no better.

00:30:09.682 --> 00:30:12.894
I was hoping to have you,
President Shin Jung-woo,

00:30:13.812 --> 00:30:18.608
become my grandson's tutor.

00:30:24.656 --> 00:30:25.740
I am far from perfect,

00:30:26.449 --> 00:30:29.202
but I'll try my best
to fulfill both roles.

00:30:31.246 --> 00:30:33.706
Good. Thank you.

00:30:58.106 --> 00:30:58.940
Hey.

00:30:59.983 --> 00:31:01.359
How could the chairman do this to me?

00:31:01.442 --> 00:31:02.861
He chose an external hire over me?

00:31:02.944 --> 00:31:05.697
Some kid,
still wet behind the ears, at that.

00:31:06.531 --> 00:31:07.448
Damn it.

00:31:08.032 --> 00:31:10.952
Can you be any more nonchalant about this?

00:31:11.035 --> 00:31:13.872
Freaking out about it
won't change a thing.

00:31:13.955 --> 00:31:16.624
What happened
to me staying quietly in the background?

00:31:16.708 --> 00:31:19.252
That was before I knew
President Kang would die.

00:31:19.335 --> 00:31:23.631
Do you really want to lose our company
to Nora, that scatterbrained fool?

00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:25.466
Dad.

00:31:26.009 --> 00:31:27.760
It was never ours to begin with.

00:31:28.803 --> 00:31:30.930
We need to make it ours.

00:31:32.348 --> 00:31:34.350
Listen to me, son.

00:31:34.934 --> 00:31:37.061
I'm betting my life on this investment.

00:31:39.105 --> 00:31:40.064
Dad.

00:31:40.148 --> 00:31:41.983
Investments

00:31:42.066 --> 00:31:44.235
can result in a loss of principal.

00:31:46.154 --> 00:31:47.030
You know that, right?

00:31:48.781 --> 00:31:51.117
I wasn't done, you punk.

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.994
Executive Director Oh, good luck!

00:31:55.538 --> 00:31:57.332
Who does that kid take after?

00:31:57.415 --> 00:32:00.585
The computerization of stock trading
will begin on September 1st.

00:32:01.169 --> 00:32:03.004
This will allow investors

00:32:03.087 --> 00:32:06.466
to freely carry out their transactions
wherever they wish,

00:32:06.549 --> 00:32:08.384
whether it be at the office or at home.

00:32:08.468 --> 00:32:10.720
A vibrant securities market
is anticipated…

00:32:10.803 --> 00:32:13.014
- Hello?
- Have you met with Chairman Kang yet?

00:32:13.097 --> 00:32:14.974
That geezer must be dying inside.

00:32:15.058 --> 00:32:17.936
He spent a fortune scouting you.

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:20.063
Well,

00:32:21.397 --> 00:32:23.650
I didn't return to Seoul
just for the money.

00:32:26.152 --> 00:32:27.403
I need to stay focused.

00:32:27.487 --> 00:32:28.655
Hey, Ms. Hong!

00:32:29.238 --> 00:32:30.740
Commercial high! Uniform girl! You!

00:32:30.823 --> 00:32:32.992
Yeah, I'm calling you.

00:32:38.247 --> 00:32:39.999
Right. I'm Hong Jang-mi.

00:32:40.917 --> 00:32:43.670
I'm a 20-year-old high school grad
working as an entry-level minion.

00:32:45.505 --> 00:32:47.423
My name is Hong Jang-mi.

00:32:47.507 --> 00:32:49.008
Right. Ms. Hong.

00:32:50.885 --> 00:32:53.304
These are the files
for the division heads' meeting tomorrow.

00:32:54.263 --> 00:32:55.390
Deliver them to Admin.

00:32:56.599 --> 00:32:57.850
Now.

00:32:57.934 --> 00:32:58.935
Me?

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:01.062
Just email them.

00:33:01.145 --> 00:33:02.855
You have a computer.
Embrace the new millennium.

00:33:02.939 --> 00:33:06.025
If you're still here then,
feel free to update the protocol.

00:33:06.109 --> 00:33:07.527
Until that day comes,

00:33:08.194 --> 00:33:09.737
you, Ms. Hong,

00:33:09.821 --> 00:33:11.823
will deliver it safely and promptly.

00:33:20.206 --> 00:33:21.165
Hold on.

00:33:21.791 --> 00:33:24.377
This obnoxious jerk could be Yehppee.

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:26.087
GENERAL MANAGER CHA JUNG-IL
RESEARCH DIVISION, HANMIN

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:27.296
YEHPPEE CANDIDATE

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:28.673
Bite your tongue.

00:33:28.756 --> 00:33:31.509
This will give you official access
to the Research Division office.

00:33:32.677 --> 00:33:33.720
Here I go.

00:33:39.642 --> 00:33:41.477
This is so damn heavy.

00:33:44.105 --> 00:33:45.773
Why hasn't Go Bok-hee been fired yet?

00:33:45.857 --> 00:33:48.234
Just tell her no if she asks for help.

00:33:48.317 --> 00:33:50.153
What if she tells on us to Ms. Song?

00:33:50.236 --> 00:33:53.156
If the three of us get our story straight,
she'll end up the liar.

00:33:54.532 --> 00:33:56.576
Go Bok-hee must be the outcast of Admin.

00:33:56.659 --> 00:33:57.493
Oh right.

00:33:57.577 --> 00:33:59.954
I looked into that girl
who fell on her face in the break room.

00:34:00.038 --> 00:34:01.539
She's Hong Jang-mi, a new hire.

00:34:01.622 --> 00:34:04.125
She was quite the rebel
at Jemulpo Girls' Commercial High School.

00:34:04.208 --> 00:34:05.168
She's badass.

00:34:05.251 --> 00:34:06.502
She sounds like a meathead.

00:34:06.586 --> 00:34:07.962
How did she ever end up here?

00:34:09.255 --> 00:34:10.882
But she seemed pretty weak that day.

00:34:12.383 --> 00:34:14.052
Maybe she's cleaning up her image.

00:34:27.231 --> 00:34:28.524
NOTICE OF TERMINATION

00:34:31.652 --> 00:34:34.030
Ms. Go, we'll have you stay on
until Chuseok in September.

00:34:35.281 --> 00:34:37.992
And put together an outline of duties
for your successor.

00:34:38.076 --> 00:34:39.077
Ms. Song.

00:34:39.827 --> 00:34:42.830
Is there any way I can stay
just until my brother is released?

00:34:42.914 --> 00:34:44.499
President Kang is dead.

00:34:46.042 --> 00:34:48.377
You have no reason to be here anymore.

00:34:50.838 --> 00:34:52.673
Thank you for running my errands
all this time.

00:34:53.382 --> 00:34:54.842
You'll find another job
with your experience.

00:34:58.471 --> 00:35:01.265
Do you know who my successor is?

00:35:05.103 --> 00:35:07.271
- Welcome.
- Welcome to the team.

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:18.616
What did President Shin Jung-woo do
before joining our company?

00:35:18.699 --> 00:35:19.742
Hey, give me a cigarette.

00:35:19.826 --> 00:35:22.203
What did Mr. Cha
from Research say earlier?

00:35:22.286 --> 00:35:23.830
Oh, about Shin Jung-woo?

00:35:23.913 --> 00:35:25.748
He got an economics degree
from Seoun University,

00:35:25.832 --> 00:35:27.667
then worked for
one of the top four accounting firms

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:30.002
before getting his MBA in Boston.

00:35:30.086 --> 00:35:32.255
He worked at a private equity fund
in Hong Kong until now.

00:35:33.673 --> 00:35:34.757
And he's unmarried.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.802
Sounds like he's led a busy life.

00:35:38.427 --> 00:35:39.720
He sounds like a great man.

00:35:39.804 --> 00:35:42.557
Mr. Oh must be disappointed.

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.225
I'm sure he assumed he'd get the position

00:35:44.308 --> 00:35:46.227
and probably got his hopes up.

00:35:47.937 --> 00:35:49.272
My dad is not disappointed.

00:35:50.565 --> 00:35:51.732
He's green with envy.

00:35:54.527 --> 00:35:56.028
Is he? Right.

00:35:56.112 --> 00:35:57.321
That's more like it.

00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:59.073
Bang Jin-mok.

00:35:59.157 --> 00:36:02.410
He speaks his mind,
regardless of seniority.

00:36:03.327 --> 00:36:05.163
And Albert doesn't seem to take offense.

00:36:06.789 --> 00:36:08.207
Is that your type?

00:36:09.083 --> 00:36:10.585
- Pardon?
- Shin Jung-woo.

00:36:11.335 --> 00:36:12.170
What?

00:36:12.253 --> 00:36:16.007
President Shin must seem like a knight
in shining armor in Ms. Hong's eyes.

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:17.592
He's quite a successful man, right?

00:36:18.509 --> 00:36:19.635
Me?

00:36:20.469 --> 00:36:24.056
I don't want a successful man.
I just want success for myself.

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:25.600
And I look at the whole package.

00:36:25.683 --> 00:36:27.018
I inspect carefully.

00:36:27.101 --> 00:36:28.102
She cares about looks.

00:36:28.186 --> 00:36:29.979
- She wants the complete package.
- Right.

00:36:31.939 --> 00:36:34.442
- Come on, let's drink up.
- Welcome to the team.

00:36:41.824 --> 00:36:45.161
In the future, it won't be
one landline per household.

00:36:45.244 --> 00:36:47.663
It'll be one wireless phone per person.

00:36:48.247 --> 00:36:50.499
A "pocket computer," if you will.

00:36:50.583 --> 00:36:51.709
He's definitely out there.

00:36:51.792 --> 00:36:53.836
With the computer
in the palm of your hand,

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.005
you'll be able to make calls
and go on the Internet.

00:36:56.088 --> 00:36:59.634
You should be an inventor,
not working at a securities firm.

00:36:59.717 --> 00:37:03.512
What a great loss
for Korea's scientific community.

00:37:03.596 --> 00:37:04.597
Then,

00:37:05.765 --> 00:37:08.643
will we be able to watch movies
on our cellphones too?

00:37:08.726 --> 00:37:11.062
- Gosh…
- If our cellphones can go online,

00:37:11.145 --> 00:37:12.480
then we could even trade stocks.

00:37:12.563 --> 00:37:14.690
- Stocks…
- Look at you go.

00:37:14.774 --> 00:37:18.694
Talk about how cars in the future
won't require drivers next,

00:37:18.778 --> 00:37:20.029
why don't you?

00:37:20.112 --> 00:37:20.988
That's not a bad idea.

00:37:21.072 --> 00:37:22.114
Good.

00:37:22.198 --> 00:37:24.742
That's not what's important right now.

00:37:24.825 --> 00:37:27.870
Who cares if we get along now?

00:37:27.954 --> 00:37:30.748
The farewell party will happen
right after Chuseok anyway.

00:37:30.831 --> 00:37:32.250
- Just drink.
- A farewell party?

00:37:33.042 --> 00:37:34.126
Who's leaving?

00:37:35.962 --> 00:37:37.755
Don't tell me you are, Mr. Bang.

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:41.008
A FAREWELL PARTY FOR HIM?

00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:42.343
{\an8}YEHPPEE CANDIDATE!
COULD HE REALLY BE YEHPPEE?

00:37:42.426 --> 00:37:44.220
Not him.

00:37:44.303 --> 00:37:45.263
Why would I leave?

00:37:45.846 --> 00:37:48.182
We're talking about you, obviously.

00:37:48.266 --> 00:37:50.893
You're just our foster child
for the time being.

00:37:50.977 --> 00:37:52.144
Foster?

00:37:52.979 --> 00:37:53.980
Me?

00:37:54.063 --> 00:37:56.232
What do you mean you're fostering me?

00:37:56.899 --> 00:37:57.900
Hold on.

00:37:58.859 --> 00:38:01.279
- Mr. Lee? What?
- We're fostering you.

00:38:02.238 --> 00:38:04.740
It's already 8:48. We have no time!

00:38:04.824 --> 00:38:06.575
- Let's get going.
- Run.

00:38:06.659 --> 00:38:07.827
- Run!
- To where?

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:09.537
Wait, Mr. Bang,
finish what you were saying.

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:11.205
- Go!
- Am I going somewhere? Am I getting fired?

00:38:11.289 --> 00:38:12.999
If you do well now, I'll tell you.

00:38:13.082 --> 00:38:15.209
Seafood pajeon, whelk soup,
two beers and two soju.

00:38:15.293 --> 00:38:17.128
- Go!
- Go!

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:21.090
- Where are we going?
- Round two.

00:38:21.173 --> 00:38:22.633
You've heard about
the 119 Campaign, right?

00:38:22.717 --> 00:38:24.135
One round, one type of alcohol…

00:38:24.218 --> 00:38:25.720
And disband before 9 p.m.!

00:38:25.803 --> 00:38:29.682
That's code for
no corporate card after nine.

00:38:30.266 --> 00:38:31.976
So we're running for drinks?

00:38:32.059 --> 00:38:33.561
To make the company pay for it?

00:38:33.644 --> 00:38:35.604
But still, having someone to run with

00:38:36.397 --> 00:38:37.440
makes it less embarrassing.

00:38:37.523 --> 00:38:40.026
Well, I'm super embarrassed.

00:38:40.943 --> 00:38:42.069
It's 8:55! Run!

00:38:42.153 --> 00:38:43.237
Ms. Hong!

00:38:44.989 --> 00:38:47.783
We'll have seafood pajeon, whelk soup,
two beers and two soju!

00:38:47.867 --> 00:38:49.035
Swipe that card. Hurry!

00:38:55.708 --> 00:38:56.542
All right.

00:39:01.088 --> 00:39:03.174
Wow, 8:59:59. Safe!

00:39:03.257 --> 00:39:04.383
Let me see.

00:39:05.968 --> 00:39:07.803
Ms. Hong, you pass!

00:39:07.887 --> 00:39:09.221
Finally, a reason to like you.

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:14.935
Enjoy.

00:39:15.853 --> 00:39:16.687
Now, tell me.

00:39:16.771 --> 00:39:18.022
This foster business.

00:39:18.105 --> 00:39:19.732
We have a new president now.

00:39:19.815 --> 00:39:21.692
New boss, new assistant.

00:39:22.401 --> 00:39:24.445
I'm supposed to be
Ms. Go Bok-hee's successor?

00:39:26.739 --> 00:39:29.408
They want me to be
President Shin Jung-woo's assistant?

00:39:29.492 --> 00:39:31.118
So you see…

00:39:31.202 --> 00:39:34.163
I guess, during your interview,

00:39:34.246 --> 00:39:36.832
you left quite an impression on Ms. Song.

00:39:36.916 --> 00:39:39.085
Meanwhile, Ms. Go lost some points

00:39:39.168 --> 00:39:41.170
for failing to prevent
that exam question error.

00:39:41.253 --> 00:39:44.090
Not to mention,
she's a 29-year-old spinster.

00:39:44.173 --> 00:39:47.927
In the head office,
high school grads never make it past 30.

00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:49.720
It's straight to
a regional branch for them.

00:39:49.804 --> 00:39:52.306
Since this is round two,
should we talk more science?

00:39:52.807 --> 00:39:53.933
Does Go Bok-hee know about this?

00:40:25.339 --> 00:40:26.257
Sir.

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:29.552
I heard a new high-school-grad hire
is to take my place.

00:40:30.136 --> 00:40:33.389
I may not have an associate's
or a bachelor's in secretarial studies,

00:40:33.472 --> 00:40:37.893
but I do have more experience
than a 20-year-old just starting out.

00:40:38.394 --> 00:40:41.355
If you give me the chance to prove myself,

00:40:41.439 --> 00:40:44.233
I'll do my utmost best to assist
as you adjust to life in Korea--

00:40:44.316 --> 00:40:47.528
Ms. Song took care of
all the necessary details already.

00:40:47.611 --> 00:40:48.737
And regarding my assistant,

00:40:49.488 --> 00:40:51.824
I believe that's up to
the administrative office to decide.

00:40:53.951 --> 00:40:55.035
Yes, sir.

00:40:55.911 --> 00:40:58.080
If there's coffee or a dish you prefer--

00:40:58.164 --> 00:40:58.998
Ms. Go.

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:01.500
Fetching meals or coffee

00:41:02.334 --> 00:41:03.669
isn't how you truly assist someone.

00:41:20.186 --> 00:41:21.604
Damn it.

00:41:52.218 --> 00:41:55.638
Ms. Hong, you've been appointed
as President Shin's new assistant.

00:41:56.847 --> 00:41:59.141
Be sure to teach her well
this week, Ms. Go.

00:42:00.559 --> 00:42:03.687
Ms. Go, your last day
will be September 13th.

00:42:04.605 --> 00:42:08.025
Ms. Hong, you'll start at the admin office
after the Chuseok break.

00:42:09.443 --> 00:42:10.444
Any questions?

00:42:11.237 --> 00:42:14.657
There's no way I can be
Shin Jung-woo's assistant.

00:42:15.908 --> 00:42:16.784
Ms. Song.

00:42:21.497 --> 00:42:22.623
BEYOND THE HAN RIVER, TO THE WORLD!
TO THE FUTURE!

00:42:23.207 --> 00:42:24.959
{\an8}This was the ad
for Hanmin's late 1997 intake

00:42:25.042 --> 00:42:27.711
{\an8}of female staff members
with high school diplomas.

00:42:28.879 --> 00:42:30.256
{\an8}The admin staff was not listed.

00:42:30.339 --> 00:42:32.883
I specifically applied
for a management support position.

00:42:35.094 --> 00:42:36.053
So?

00:42:36.887 --> 00:42:38.681
Being in Admin never even crossed my--

00:42:38.764 --> 00:42:40.099
Let it cross now.

00:42:44.853 --> 00:42:47.147
The biggest misconception rookies can have
about entering the workforce.

00:42:49.775 --> 00:42:50.943
You think you choose the company?

00:42:52.319 --> 00:42:53.153
No.

00:42:54.071 --> 00:42:57.408
The companies choose,
and they decide where to use you.

00:42:59.577 --> 00:43:01.912
If you don't like that,
you should leave the workforce.

00:43:02.871 --> 00:43:03.789
Do you want to quit?

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:28.230
I don't drink vending machine coffee.

00:43:34.028 --> 00:43:35.821
You'll be the president's assistant.

00:43:35.904 --> 00:43:36.947
Who would turn that down?

00:43:38.907 --> 00:43:42.411
I'd rather not work with those assistants
I fought with in the break room.

00:43:44.496 --> 00:43:47.791
You didn't put up much of a fight.
The fighting was very much one-sided.

00:43:52.546 --> 00:43:53.380
Bok-hee.

00:43:53.881 --> 00:43:55.799
Shin Jung-woo doesn't appreciate change.

00:43:56.383 --> 00:43:58.427
Once he sees
what you're capable of firsthand,

00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:00.012
he won't ask for a new assistant.

00:44:00.846 --> 00:44:02.014
How do you know that?

00:44:03.432 --> 00:44:04.308
Also,

00:44:04.391 --> 00:44:06.894
you can't call him by his name.
He's not your friend.

00:44:06.977 --> 00:44:09.021
Are you going to call the chairman
by his name next?

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:10.814
You mean Kang Pil-beom?

00:44:12.191 --> 00:44:13.942
This is what's wrong with kids nowadays.

00:44:14.026 --> 00:44:15.569
What if someone hears you?

00:44:16.403 --> 00:44:17.613
There's no one here.

00:44:18.989 --> 00:44:21.325
Who would you say the late President Kang

00:44:21.408 --> 00:44:23.369
was closest to at the company?

00:44:24.286 --> 00:44:27.414
If there was a general manager
he was close to, they might help you out.

00:44:29.208 --> 00:44:31.418
Try making an earnest plea.

00:44:32.544 --> 00:44:33.379
I could come with you.

00:44:43.305 --> 00:44:44.264
Come on.

00:44:44.348 --> 00:44:46.809
Who would help out
an assistant with no boss?

00:44:47.851 --> 00:44:48.686
Jeez.

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.648
She's a tough one.

00:44:55.943 --> 00:44:57.903
Maybe she's really trying to help me?

00:45:12.126 --> 00:45:13.210
My Albert.

00:45:14.044 --> 00:45:15.421
Oh Deok-gyu Jr.

00:45:16.505 --> 00:45:17.381
Is he doing well?

00:45:17.464 --> 00:45:19.133
You know, Big Al is

00:45:20.426 --> 00:45:21.427
a remarkable man.

00:45:23.804 --> 00:45:24.680
Really?

00:45:26.723 --> 00:45:28.183
If you had to give specific examples?

00:45:30.227 --> 00:45:31.812
Frankly, no one would say anything

00:45:31.895 --> 00:45:34.690
if someone of his stature
only showed up twice a week.

00:45:34.773 --> 00:45:37.443
Despite that,
he still shows up, all six days.

00:45:38.277 --> 00:45:41.113
You know,

00:45:41.196 --> 00:45:43.198
he really leads by example.

00:45:43.282 --> 00:45:44.366
That's what I think.

00:45:51.081 --> 00:45:53.125
Punctuality is fundamental
in any organization.

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:54.710
But you know,

00:45:55.586 --> 00:45:58.130
that punctuality
never helps you stand out.

00:45:58.755 --> 00:46:00.007
Just look at President Shin.

00:46:00.799 --> 00:46:02.718
His flashy résumé crafts his public image.

00:46:03.469 --> 00:46:05.846
Maybe he's so obnoxious
because he feels like he's above us?

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:09.391
He has yet to pay me a visit
to introduce himself.

00:46:10.684 --> 00:46:13.270
That's a bit problematic.

00:46:13.353 --> 00:46:15.481
- You think so too, right?
- Yes.

00:46:15.564 --> 00:46:18.192
That's why I'm going all out
for his initiation.

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:22.237
The chairman is known
to unleash a barrage of questions

00:46:22.321 --> 00:46:24.740
at every first all-hands meeting
of the quarter, right?

00:46:24.823 --> 00:46:28.744
Yes, that's why the Research Division
prepares a list of possible questions

00:46:28.827 --> 00:46:30.287
and answers for you, every quarter.

00:46:30.370 --> 00:46:31.747
Right, that's it.

00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:34.041
But President Shin
doesn't know about that yet.

00:46:34.124 --> 00:46:35.209
He does not.

00:46:36.126 --> 00:46:37.336
Not yet.

00:46:37.419 --> 00:46:40.672
Seeing Shin Jung-woo flush red
after failing to answer a question

00:46:40.756 --> 00:46:42.216
the chairman ambushed him with…

00:46:42.799 --> 00:46:46.595
Man, just imagining it gives me chills.

00:46:46.678 --> 00:46:47.596
Who am I?

00:46:47.679 --> 00:46:49.640
I am the Oh Deok-gyu,
but he doesn't know that.

00:46:52.267 --> 00:46:53.393
So, tell me.

00:46:54.561 --> 00:46:55.729
Do you plan on…

00:46:57.231 --> 00:46:59.399
aligning yourself
with that figurehead President Shin?

00:47:19.002 --> 00:47:19.878
Yeah.

00:47:20.754 --> 00:47:21.964
I need something to grab onto.

00:47:22.839 --> 00:47:24.675
I can just switch sides if things go awry.

00:47:26.009 --> 00:47:27.261
PRESIDENT'S OFFICE

00:47:31.181 --> 00:47:32.766
Ms. Hong, delivery time.

00:47:34.101 --> 00:47:35.894
It's for the Monday weekly meeting,

00:47:35.978 --> 00:47:37.771
so just deliver the whole thing to Admin.

00:47:46.613 --> 00:47:49.616
Jeez, always sending me
to deliver this and that.

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:51.285
Why can't he write a damn email?

00:47:56.582 --> 00:48:00.002
Shall I take a look at
what he wrote in the report?

00:48:04.423 --> 00:48:05.257
Nothing much, apparently.

00:48:07.259 --> 00:48:08.677
Equity Management Division?

00:48:10.012 --> 00:48:11.263
WEEKLY MEETING OUTLINE
FINANCIAL TRENDS AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

00:48:19.563 --> 00:48:21.982
Why is the report
for the president's office different?

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:46.590
What's with the loitering?

00:48:46.673 --> 00:48:47.758
Are you here to claim your future?

00:48:47.841 --> 00:48:51.094
What is this list of
model questions and answers about?

00:48:52.012 --> 00:48:53.472
To prepare for the chairman's
rapid-fire questions

00:48:53.555 --> 00:48:55.641
at the first quarterly meeting.

00:48:55.724 --> 00:48:57.017
Research is in charge of that.

00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:59.144
But why is it missing
from President Shin's report?

00:48:59.227 --> 00:49:01.063
What? Let me see.

00:49:07.194 --> 00:49:08.195
It's really missing.

00:49:08.862 --> 00:49:10.197
It's only missing from his report.

00:49:10.781 --> 00:49:13.909
Mr. Cha definitely reviewed it all
before giving it to me.

00:49:13.992 --> 00:49:15.243
Could it have been intentional?

00:49:16.453 --> 00:49:18.330
Cha Jung-il, that jerk.

00:49:18.413 --> 00:49:20.791
He's a master at stirring trouble,
shifting blame, and backing out.

00:49:20.874 --> 00:49:23.377
That accounting question error
you pointed out?

00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:25.003
I told him about it before you.

00:49:25.087 --> 00:49:27.047
He just ignored me and let it slip by.

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:29.675
She really hates him.

00:49:30.425 --> 00:49:31.760
You can tell by his face.

00:49:31.843 --> 00:49:34.137
He looks shameless and slick.

00:49:34.221 --> 00:49:36.515
No wonder he had that long meeting
with Executive Director Oh.

00:49:36.598 --> 00:49:37.933
He's clearly aligning himself with Oh.

00:49:39.976 --> 00:49:40.936
How about this?

00:49:41.937 --> 00:49:44.815
While the old guard
is messing with the newcomer,

00:49:44.898 --> 00:49:48.360
you swoop in and show President Shin
how capable an assistant you are.

00:49:48.944 --> 00:49:51.613
You make him realize
that experience can't be beat.

00:49:51.697 --> 00:49:52.614
What do you say?

00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:12.342
I was just stabbed in the back

00:50:12.426 --> 00:50:14.386
by everyone I trusted,
from Ms. Song to the assistants.

00:50:15.303 --> 00:50:17.597
Why would I trust a rookie like you?

00:50:18.432 --> 00:50:20.726
Don't get crafty with me.

00:50:20.809 --> 00:50:22.519
I know you're after my position.

00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:27.607
Would I have hidden like that
if I were after your job?

00:50:27.691 --> 00:50:30.193
I would've stuck my head out
to have him notice me.

00:50:33.613 --> 00:50:35.240
THE UTMOST BEST!

00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:39.828
People think working hard
is how you do your "utmost best."

00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:41.204
But that's wrong.

00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:43.915
Utmost, "to the fullest." Best, "outwit."

00:50:43.999 --> 00:50:47.002
Outwitting your opponent to the fullest
is doing your "utmost best."

00:50:47.085 --> 00:50:49.421
This is a win-win for you and me.

00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:51.006
Good, no?

00:50:55.927 --> 00:50:56.887
THE UTMOST BEST!

00:50:57.929 --> 00:50:59.014
Be on standby after work.

00:50:59.639 --> 00:51:00.849
Until I call for you, all right?

00:51:13.612 --> 00:51:14.905
Come to the admin office.

00:51:15.989 --> 00:51:19.117
President Shin left for the day, right?

00:51:19.868 --> 00:51:21.369
Don't worry and come already.

00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:23.371
I'll be right there.

00:51:25.749 --> 00:51:28.168
Equity Management's answer sheet
will go to Trading.

00:51:28.251 --> 00:51:30.045
Trading's answer sheet
will go to Accounting.

00:51:30.879 --> 00:51:33.548
We'll mix up
all the general managers' reports

00:51:33.632 --> 00:51:36.176
and make sure President Shin
is the only one with answers.

00:51:36.259 --> 00:51:37.344
What if we get caught?

00:51:38.011 --> 00:51:39.221
We'll say it's a simple binding error.

00:51:39.304 --> 00:51:41.932
If anyone is held responsible,
it should be Mr. Cha.

00:51:42.015 --> 00:51:43.934
Research is in charge of the reports,
after all.

00:51:44.017 --> 00:51:47.229
Aren't you a bit too young
to be stirring up this kind of trouble?

00:51:47.312 --> 00:51:48.814
I'm just giving it my all.

00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:52.025
We'll be fired immediately
if we're caught.

00:51:53.568 --> 00:51:54.528
Bok-hee.

00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:56.321
You've already been fired.

00:52:20.387 --> 00:52:23.098
Let's leave the rest of the files
in the conference room before we go.

00:52:23.682 --> 00:52:25.559
Okay. When did Jung…

00:52:25.642 --> 00:52:27.435
I mean, when did
President Shin leave for the day?

00:52:27.519 --> 00:52:29.437
He hasn't. He's still here.

00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:32.649
He's still here?

00:52:33.233 --> 00:52:34.401
It's fine.

00:52:34.484 --> 00:52:36.653
You've been here since seven,
and it's ten now,

00:52:36.736 --> 00:52:37.821
but that door hasn't opened once.

00:52:38.488 --> 00:52:39.322
In fact,

00:52:39.406 --> 00:52:42.492
he's been working late every day
ever since he joined on September 1st.

00:52:42.576 --> 00:52:44.077
He's been reviewing

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:46.705
three years' worth of annual,
quarterly, and monthly business plans,

00:52:46.788 --> 00:52:49.124
investment performance,
and even media trends.

00:52:50.333 --> 00:52:51.459
He doesn't even stop to eat.

00:52:51.543 --> 00:52:53.378
I asked him what he liked to eat,

00:52:53.461 --> 00:52:55.714
and he told me
that's not how you truly assist someone.

00:52:56.298 --> 00:52:58.383
Just order him a pizza. He likes pizza.

00:52:59.801 --> 00:53:00.635
How do you know?

00:53:05.765 --> 00:53:08.643
Risk Management is where
all the guys hang out and chat.

00:53:09.644 --> 00:53:10.478
Right.

00:53:13.607 --> 00:53:16.735
By the way, can't we finish the rest
back at our dorm?

00:53:18.403 --> 00:53:21.239
So we can operate covertly
and with more precision?

00:53:32.167 --> 00:53:33.335
{\an8}INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE REPORT

00:53:41.092 --> 00:53:42.177
Come in.

00:53:53.855 --> 00:53:57.359
I brought a pizza
since it seemed like you skipped dinner.

00:54:00.153 --> 00:54:01.321
Sir.

00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:04.032
If you're planning to work
well into the night again,

00:54:04.115 --> 00:54:06.785
do you mind if I go home first?

00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:11.414
Sure. Go ahead.

00:54:11.998 --> 00:54:13.208
Thank you, sir.

00:54:35.855 --> 00:54:38.149
The man who turned down
burgers, sandwiches, and salads

00:54:38.233 --> 00:54:39.275
accepted the pizza tonight.

00:54:42.445 --> 00:54:44.072
Why are you helping me?

00:54:45.156 --> 00:54:47.409
After 29 years,
I've learned there's no such thing

00:54:47.492 --> 00:54:49.828
as free goodwill or charity.

00:54:51.663 --> 00:54:54.124
I told you this is for me, not you.

00:54:54.916 --> 00:54:57.544
Also, we're roommates.

00:55:04.676 --> 00:55:06.177
If things don't work out,

00:55:06.261 --> 00:55:09.973
we can pick up a box of ribs
and visit President Kang's trusted ally.

00:55:10.056 --> 00:55:11.683
I'll kneel and beg right next to you.

00:55:12.892 --> 00:55:15.395
They're not really
the type to accept bribes.

00:55:16.062 --> 00:55:17.522
Ribs aren't cheap, either.

00:55:17.605 --> 00:55:21.609
It'll still be cheaper than your life.

00:55:23.445 --> 00:55:25.113
And what might their name be?

00:55:25.905 --> 00:55:27.824
Focus. You made a typo.

00:55:31.786 --> 00:55:32.662
There.

00:55:42.338 --> 00:55:43.673
Why are we going in early today?

00:55:43.757 --> 00:55:45.800
We have our weekly meeting today.

00:55:45.884 --> 00:55:48.928
After that break room brawl,
the other assistants and Queen Bee…

00:55:49.471 --> 00:55:50.680
Oh my god.

00:55:52.223 --> 00:55:54.392
It's 7:45 now.

00:55:54.476 --> 00:55:56.061
We'll update the president

00:55:56.144 --> 00:55:58.563
and head to the weekly meeting for 8:30.

00:56:06.571 --> 00:56:07.405
- What?
- What's wrong?

00:56:08.448 --> 00:56:09.407
The meeting was moved up.

00:56:09.908 --> 00:56:11.743
It's going to start in 15 minutes!

00:56:11.826 --> 00:56:12.952
What?

00:56:13.036 --> 00:56:14.746
- Let's run.
- Okay.

00:56:14.829 --> 00:56:16.498
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

00:56:29.636 --> 00:56:31.638
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, sir.

00:56:34.599 --> 00:56:35.683
Where's Ms. Go?

00:56:41.064 --> 00:56:42.982
How am I the only one who didn't know?

00:56:43.566 --> 00:56:44.400
Isn't it obvious?

00:56:44.484 --> 00:56:46.778
The smug trio of assistants
is trying to screw you over.

00:56:51.282 --> 00:56:54.369
No assistant should be late
to the weekly meeting.

00:56:54.452 --> 00:56:55.537
Why, you…

00:56:56.246 --> 00:56:57.372
Urgent matter comes first.

00:56:58.706 --> 00:56:59.958
Wait!

00:57:25.650 --> 00:57:27.402
My word.

00:57:32.991 --> 00:57:35.243
This is ridiculous.

00:57:48.381 --> 00:57:50.383
Not a single person here

00:57:50.467 --> 00:57:53.136
can answer my question?

00:57:53.219 --> 00:57:55.180
You're all just
silently flipping some pages!

00:57:55.722 --> 00:57:57.056
Unbelievable.

00:57:58.308 --> 00:57:59.851
This is not the time

00:57:59.934 --> 00:58:02.145
for you to leisurely sip some damn coffee!

00:58:03.021 --> 00:58:05.356
Get rid of it all!

00:58:06.608 --> 00:58:08.485
I can't believe this.

00:58:10.737 --> 00:58:12.780
Hey, get in here. Hurry!

00:58:16.117 --> 00:58:18.077
- Let's go.
- That little…

00:58:25.877 --> 00:58:27.128
Bring back all the coffee cups.

00:58:34.177 --> 00:58:35.595
{\an8}WEEKLY MEETING OUTLINE

00:58:57.784 --> 00:58:58.952
President Shin.

00:59:00.828 --> 00:59:02.622
Let me ask you a few questions.

00:59:03.915 --> 00:59:05.583
Please go ahead, sir.

00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:08.002
Well…

00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:15.134
Who in the world…

00:59:16.636 --> 00:59:17.554
Go!

00:59:19.514 --> 00:59:20.390
Sorry.

00:59:20.473 --> 00:59:21.307
Why…

00:59:31.568 --> 00:59:33.444
These are anticipated Q&As
for the chairman.

00:59:33.528 --> 00:59:34.487
Must read!

00:59:36.781 --> 00:59:38.324
I should grab the broom.

00:59:52.088 --> 00:59:53.339
So damn embarrassing!

00:59:55.675 --> 00:59:58.761
How could they hire such dumb girls?

00:59:58.845 --> 01:00:00.388
Are you serious right now?

01:00:01.055 --> 01:00:04.100
Do you know how embarrassed I was?

01:00:04.892 --> 01:00:05.727
You.

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:12.025
How dare you hold your head high

01:00:12.650 --> 01:00:14.152
when you've done nothing right?

01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:19.824
Damn it.

01:00:22.118 --> 01:00:22.952
"Damn it"?

01:00:24.203 --> 01:00:25.496
"Damn it"?

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.291
Damn it!

01:00:30.752 --> 01:00:32.837
I did it, okay?

01:00:33.421 --> 01:00:35.006
Don't take it out on them.

01:00:36.174 --> 01:00:38.426
We're the ones screwed, not you.

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:42.555
Don't just stand there!

01:00:43.264 --> 01:00:44.140
Let's go.

01:00:57.403 --> 01:00:58.946
That damn runt.

01:00:59.447 --> 01:01:02.283
Big Al, what do you mean we're screwed?

01:01:04.744 --> 01:01:08.414
The president wants all materials,
from reports to briefings, to be digitized

01:01:08.915 --> 01:01:09.874
and shared company-wide.

01:01:10.458 --> 01:01:12.210
Through an information-sharing system?

01:01:12.293 --> 01:01:13.169
Who's making it?

01:01:13.753 --> 01:01:14.796
That's the issue.

01:01:15.922 --> 01:01:16.756
The Risk Management Division.

01:01:18.424 --> 01:01:19.592
What?

01:01:20.259 --> 01:01:21.219
They want us to make it.

01:01:22.053 --> 01:01:23.221
Can we really?

01:01:24.555 --> 01:01:26.641
Goodness.

01:01:26.724 --> 01:01:27.850
My heart is racing already.

01:01:28.601 --> 01:01:30.978
I'm sure you'll do well, Mr. Lee.

01:01:32.438 --> 01:01:35.316
Well, who's going to be
the president's assistant?

01:01:36.818 --> 01:01:40.697
The executives and general managers
don't bother studying the data

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:43.616
and just memorize a script made by others?

01:01:44.409 --> 01:01:46.244
This is not a path to company growth.

01:01:47.912 --> 01:01:51.416
Thanks to you, I found out how outdated
this company's practices are.

01:01:58.339 --> 01:02:00.049
Ms. Song, this is Shin Jung-woo.

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:04.011
A new president with a new assistant
could make things difficult for everyone.

01:02:04.095 --> 01:02:06.681
I'll continue working with Ms. Go.

01:02:08.182 --> 01:02:09.308
Take care.

01:02:09.892 --> 01:02:10.768
Did you hear that?

01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:16.441
Sir, that means I can continue
working as your assistant, right?

01:02:16.524 --> 01:02:17.900
Yes, that's right.

01:02:18.943 --> 01:02:21.904
It seems you and I share similar views
on the market and the organization.

01:02:21.988 --> 01:02:22.905
Especially,

01:02:22.989 --> 01:02:25.575
your proposal to implement
an information-sharing system.

01:02:25.658 --> 01:02:27.285
LEE YONG-GI, CYBER BANKING DEVELOPER
RECOMMENDED

01:02:27.368 --> 01:02:30.246
Recommending the cyber banking developer
to oversee the project

01:02:30.955 --> 01:02:31.956
was also insightful.

01:02:37.253 --> 01:02:38.421
DEVELOP AN INFORMATION-SHARING SYSTEM

01:02:38.504 --> 01:02:40.840
That was all Hong Jang-mi.

01:02:42.425 --> 01:02:43.509
I hope this works out.

01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:45.511
Thank you, sir.

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:48.514
I promise to do
my utmost best going forward.

01:02:51.726 --> 01:02:53.060
By the way, Ms. Go.

01:02:53.686 --> 01:02:55.188
Yes, sir?

01:02:56.981 --> 01:02:59.275
The pizza from the other night…

01:03:00.902 --> 01:03:03.029
Did you know that I liked pizza?

01:03:05.323 --> 01:03:06.407
It wasn't my idea.

01:03:07.492 --> 01:03:09.327
A younger staff member recommended it.

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:11.537
It was my roommate's idea.

01:03:14.707 --> 01:03:16.042
I finally get to toss this out.

01:03:17.335 --> 01:03:18.377
Hey, you!

01:03:19.086 --> 01:03:21.464
Do you know how important
the weekly meetings are?

01:03:21.547 --> 01:03:23.883
You can't push us college grads
aside and barge in!

01:03:27.637 --> 01:03:29.305
Hey, you!

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:36.854
I'm not "Hey, you." I'm Hong Jang-mi.

01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:39.899
I'm Hong Jang-mi
from Jemulpo Girls' Commercial High.

01:03:40.817 --> 01:03:42.985
What? You have a problem
with commercial high schools?

01:03:45.279 --> 01:03:46.113
- No.
- No.

01:03:47.031 --> 01:03:48.157
Then why do you look down on it?

01:03:49.367 --> 01:03:52.453
Surely, you didn't learn that in college.

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:55.998
Should you tease
and bully your colleagues or not?

01:03:58.584 --> 01:03:59.919
- You shouldn't.
- You shouldn't.

01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:03.464
If I catch you three
pulling one more cheap trick,

01:04:04.173 --> 01:04:08.886
I'll show you why they used to call me
the badass meathead.

01:04:11.931 --> 01:04:15.184
Let's try our best to foster
a healthy work environment

01:04:15.268 --> 01:04:17.687
based on mutual respect, dear sisters.

01:04:18.396 --> 01:04:19.272
Okay?

01:04:34.412 --> 01:04:37.331
President Shin says he wants to
keep you on as his assistant.

01:04:37.415 --> 01:04:38.583
I told him fine.

01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:40.418
You can stay on.

01:04:41.377 --> 01:04:43.504
Thank you, ma'am.
I'll be sure to work hard.

01:04:43.588 --> 01:04:44.839
Also,

01:04:45.381 --> 01:04:47.383
you live with a Kang Eun-joo
in the dorms, right?

01:04:47.466 --> 01:04:51.178
Yes, how do you know her?

01:04:51.262 --> 01:04:52.138
Kang Eun-joo is…

01:04:54.015 --> 01:04:55.892
Chairman Kang Pil-beom's daughter.

01:04:56.767 --> 01:04:58.769
She's the late President Kang's
half-sister.

01:04:58.853 --> 01:05:01.314
She's our chairman's daughter?

01:05:02.148 --> 01:05:04.442
Nora has lived overseas for a long time,

01:05:04.525 --> 01:05:06.152
so she has no friends in Korea.

01:05:06.694 --> 01:05:08.404
Office life won't be easy on her, either.

01:05:09.155 --> 01:05:10.865
Help her get settled into her new life.

01:05:12.199 --> 01:05:13.326
And report back weekly

01:05:13.409 --> 01:05:15.745
on how she's doing
during the three probationary months.

01:05:16.996 --> 01:05:17.914
You already know,

01:05:17.997 --> 01:05:20.416
all of this stays between you and me.

01:05:20.499 --> 01:05:21.709
Yes, ma'am.

01:05:21.792 --> 01:05:24.253
Thank you for entrusting me
with such a task.

01:05:34.263 --> 01:05:36.349
The president wants to keep me on
as his assistant.

01:05:37.558 --> 01:05:38.517
I knew it.

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:41.062
She makes it sound like
she does all the work.

01:05:41.145 --> 01:05:41.979
That's what I'm saying.

01:05:50.863 --> 01:05:51.697
Apologize.

01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:57.203
I'm sorry about today.

01:05:58.996 --> 01:06:00.915
And about the break room incident too.

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:04.377
Get lost.

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:15.554
What's with them?

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:18.224
I guess they heard you'll be staying on.

01:06:18.891 --> 01:06:19.892
Already?

01:06:20.893 --> 01:06:21.936
Anyhow,

01:06:23.104 --> 01:06:24.063
thanks.

01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:27.400
You said I should ask for help

01:06:27.483 --> 01:06:29.860
from the one
the late president was closest to.

01:06:30.486 --> 01:06:32.321
I spent all night racking my brain,

01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:35.533
wondering if I should visit Mr. So
with a box of expensive ribs.

01:06:36.158 --> 01:06:38.285
You mean Mr. So Gyeong-dong
in the Trading Division?

01:06:38.369 --> 01:06:40.246
SO GYEONG-DONG
MOST LIKELY TO BE YEHPPEE

01:06:40.329 --> 01:06:43.666
Yeah, Mr. So is the well-respected,
seasoned veteran in Hanmin.

01:06:45.209 --> 01:06:47.420
Every time President Kang
had a tough decision to make,

01:06:47.503 --> 01:06:49.755
he made sure to consult Mr. So.

01:06:51.048 --> 01:06:52.675
I see.

01:06:52.758 --> 01:06:55.636
Did the two of them meet
the day before President Kang died?

01:06:56.804 --> 01:06:58.389
The prosecution's investigation had them

01:06:58.472 --> 01:07:00.558
meeting and working late
every day for a month.

01:07:02.518 --> 01:07:03.936
So Gyeong-dong.

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:05.354
President Kang's mentor

01:07:05.438 --> 01:07:07.523
and a well-respected,
seasoned veteran in Hanmin.

01:07:07.606 --> 01:07:10.317
The investigation had them
meeting and working late for a month.

01:07:10.401 --> 01:07:11.736
He's got to be Yehppee.

01:07:17.241 --> 01:07:21.328
You know how you asked me
to look into Go Bok-hee?

01:07:21.412 --> 01:07:22.329
Yes.

01:07:23.330 --> 01:07:24.665
There's something fishy.

01:07:26.167 --> 01:07:27.126
About Go Bok-hee?

01:07:29.253 --> 01:07:30.254
Take care.

01:07:32.423 --> 01:07:35.259
Before rejoining Hanmin,

01:07:35.342 --> 01:07:38.554
she hopped around regional second-tier
financial institutions on a yearly basis.

01:07:43.142 --> 01:07:45.269
Well, the manager of Saenara Bank in Yeosu

01:07:45.352 --> 01:07:46.937
reported her to the police…

01:07:48.314 --> 01:07:49.273
for larceny.

01:07:50.649 --> 01:07:52.359
EXPRESS BUS
YEOSU TO SEOUL

01:07:52.443 --> 01:07:53.569
- What?
- The next day,

01:07:53.652 --> 01:07:55.654
the report was withdrawn.

01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:58.783
But it also turned out
that the manager had been embezzling.

01:07:59.408 --> 01:08:01.035
And the money disappeared with Go Bok-hee?

01:08:01.118 --> 01:08:02.495
It did.

01:08:03.621 --> 01:08:04.580
Listen,

01:08:04.663 --> 01:08:07.416
she's a thief
who backstabbed another thief.

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.668
How can you trust her?

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:16.717
What in the world?

01:08:46.997 --> 01:08:48.124
NEW MAIL FROM YEHPPEE@KEBEO.CO.KR

01:08:48.207 --> 01:08:50.376
- "Yehppee"?
- Yehppee and I

01:08:51.043 --> 01:08:53.838
are getting the ledger together
for whistleblowing purposes.

01:08:53.921 --> 01:08:56.173
Pick it up at the president's office
on the 12th floor

01:08:56.257 --> 01:08:57.591
in Hanmin's head office.

01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:00.511
- Is it not there?
- This can't be.

01:09:03.848 --> 01:09:05.474
{\an8}Since I know what this is now,

01:09:05.558 --> 01:09:08.018
I'll make another clean score
and disappear.

01:09:13.190 --> 01:09:15.985
Damn, how can I trust an embezzler?

01:09:16.569 --> 01:09:18.654
It means Go Bok-hee is a pro.

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:23.742
President Kang's agenda.

01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:25.744
They wouldn't have tossed it out already.

01:10:03.699 --> 01:10:05.534
Think, Hong Keum-bo.

01:10:05.618 --> 01:10:07.536
You've been working for ten years.

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:09.205
You can find this with your eyes closed.

01:10:15.669 --> 01:10:17.296
FRUITS CANDY

01:10:21.884 --> 01:10:22.718
Got it.

01:10:28.432 --> 01:10:29.475
FEBRUARY BUSINESS PLAN

01:10:35.481 --> 01:10:36.315
3RD QUARTER SCHEDULE

01:10:36.398 --> 01:10:37.274
Found it.

01:10:40.819 --> 01:10:42.321
What? Why is it empty?

01:10:56.835 --> 01:10:58.212
Yes, I'm still at my office.

01:10:59.630 --> 01:11:00.631
I'll be right down.

01:11:59.982 --> 01:12:01.817
Why does he work in the dark?

01:12:02.568 --> 01:12:04.153
My poor heart.

01:12:17.207 --> 01:12:18.042
Keum-bo.

01:12:19.043 --> 01:12:19.877
Hong Keum-bo.

01:12:26.383 --> 01:12:30.637
{\an8}SPECIAL THANKS TO SHIN YU-NA
FOR HER APPEARANCE

01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:03.545
{\an8}UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

01:13:04.129 --> 01:13:06.006
{\an8}Hong Jang-mi,
the president is asking for you.

01:13:07.758 --> 01:13:10.844
{\an8}Do you happen to know
the name of Mr. So's dog?

01:13:10.928 --> 01:13:12.805
{\an8}So pretty. I mean, Yehppee.

01:13:12.888 --> 01:13:15.849
{\an8}What's with the perm and highlights?

01:13:15.933 --> 01:13:17.851
{\an8}Maybe I should try Go Bok-hee again.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.896
{\an8}Hong Jang-mi, what's your deal?
What are you digging through?

01:13:20.979 --> 01:13:21.814
{\an8}Oh, I'm not…

01:13:21.897 --> 01:13:23.899
{\an8}Blending in is barely enough
to get you by right now.

01:13:23.982 --> 01:13:26.860
{\an8}How can you go
and attract even more attention?

01:13:26.944 --> 01:13:28.112
{\an8}About Ms. Hong…

01:13:28.195 --> 01:13:29.488
{\an8}I've seen her somewhere before.

01:13:29.571 --> 01:13:31.907
{\an8}The Financial Supervisory Service
will be here for an investigation today.

01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:33.450
{\an8}The Financial Supervisory Service?

01:13:35.119 --> 01:13:40.124
