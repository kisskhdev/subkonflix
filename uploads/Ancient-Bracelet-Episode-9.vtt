00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.510
Zhaoli.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.320
From now on, do not leave

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.470
without telling me.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.710
(If I don't keep an eye on her
for a day,)

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.370
(she starts thinking
about another man.)

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.990
Zhaoli,

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:32.630
wake up.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.150
Don't leave me behind.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.350
Now, I just want to throw you out.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.840
Ying Du?

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.510
You're back.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.790
Why are you hauling me around?

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.200
You're ruining my sweet dream.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.040
Sweet dream?

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.400
Were you dreaming about Yan Che again?

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.150
Of course not.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.030
Is it the one from your previous dreams?

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:10.710
Then did you

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.710
dream of me?

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.870
Zhaoli, do you have feelings

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.710
for me?

Is this real?

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:39.800
You don't like it?

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.120
Then I'll take it back.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.520
thank you.

It's fine.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.400
Don't worry.

00:03:08.826 --> 00:03:10.040
The Frostbite Curse in Ying Du

00:03:10.051 --> 00:03:11.590
has been striking more often.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.360
Could it be from losing his power?

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.400
Oracle.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.630
(Oracle)
A century-old herb for you.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.000
Do you know how to break

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.960
the backlash from losing one's power?

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.400
Why do people keep asking me this?

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.750
I don't know the cure

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.470
for that kind of backlash either.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.120
But there is one way

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.960
to sever one's sense of pain.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.590
Once the pain is gone,

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.190
the harm one takes

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.630
will lessen as well.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.470
What method is that?

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.400
The Soulfall Ring.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.120
- But its whereabouts are unknown.
- The Soulfall Ring.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.710
It's not easy to find.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.110
Still,

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.680
I can't just take this herb

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.000
for nothing.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.630
You've been looking radiant lately.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.240
Have you found someone you like?

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.030
But

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.430
you two are trapped

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.950
in a cycle of grudges and tangled fate.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.480
If you keep holding on,

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.680
you'll lose everyone you hold dear.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.510
You and he are destined

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.950
to meet as enemies, bound by hate.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.240
Though I dislike Oracle's words,

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.720
he's the heaven-eyed diviner.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.480
The fortunes he casts

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.510
have never been wrong.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:50.710
Be careful.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.760
Che.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.000
Zhaoli,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.840
it's me.

00:05:30.523 --> 00:05:32.236
Zhaoli said she'd come
to the Ghost Market.

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:33.390
Why don't I see her?

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.040
Zhaoli, let's talk somewhere else.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.960
Come.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.110
(Yan Che?)

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.190
(How does he know my spells?)

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.240
(Could he be the man in black?)

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.030
Your Majesty,

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:55.327
I've found something.

00:05:55.338 --> 00:05:57.506
Lately, a mysterious figure
skilled in spells appeared

00:05:57.517 --> 00:05:58.661
by the Grand Princess's side.

00:05:58.672 --> 00:06:00.622
That man is Yan Che of the Wuyue tribe.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.510
He hides himself well.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.270
What is he really after?

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:09.230
Zhaoli.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.200
Che,

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.560
when did you learn spells?

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.000
They're exactly like Ying Du's.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.270
I learned them while cultivating.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.870
What were you about to tell me just now?

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.880
Zhaoli,

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:28.570
I feel that there's a bond

00:06:28.581 --> 00:06:29.870
by nature between us.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.510
I often have the same dream.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.390
In my dream,

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.620
we've shared

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:36.950
countless nights as a couple.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:40.550
A dream?

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.973
These past years, I've kept dreaming

00:06:41.984 --> 00:06:43.040
we're inside a palace

00:06:43.446 --> 00:06:45.160
when suddenly,
the man in black bursts in.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.070
In that dream,

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.789
I managed to block his attack
just in time.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:54.040
Your dream

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.360
is exactly the same as mine.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.920
Oracle says it's a foretelling dream.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.690
Zhaoli, I'm worried about you.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.310
But why speak of it only now?

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.950
I never mentioned it before,

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.410
because I believed

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.120
we'd naturally end up together.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.190
But since Ying Du arrived,

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.680
he's all you think about.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.830
I wanted to let go,

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:15.630
but I couldn't.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:17.470
Zhaoli,

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.390
will you give me one more chance?

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.400
Yes.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.040
I used to be so fixated

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.800
on finding the one from my dream.

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.680
Because I thought it was
a foretelling dream.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.430
But ever since Ying Du appeared,

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.360
I haven't had that dream again.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.560
Perhaps my worry was needless.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:43.036
Zhaoli,

00:07:43.047 --> 00:07:44.525
this is a rare treasure I came across

00:07:44.536 --> 00:07:45.480
during my cultivation.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.310
They say it can block out pain.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:48.360
I want you to have it.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:49.510
May it keep you safe.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.120
The Soulfall Ring.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.560
You recognize it?

00:07:53.673 --> 00:07:54.593
(Only this can soothe)

00:07:54.604 --> 00:07:56.720
(the agony Ying Du suffers
from the Frostbite Curse.)

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.220
Che,

00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:59.360
I'll take this then.

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:00.750
Thank you.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.720
I thought you'd refuse it.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.480
This treasure is far too precious.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.510
I'll give you all the money

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.070
and rare herbs

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:10.270
I've saved up

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:11.270
to exchange for it.

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:12.583
I'll fetch them for you right now.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:14.430
I don't want your money.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.440
This alone is enough.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.430
Ying Du, what are you doing?

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:26.393
Don't speak up for him.

00:08:26.433 --> 00:08:27.510
But acting like this...

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.560
Zhaoli.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:44.720
I won't allow you to treat her this way.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.080
What are you trying to do?

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.150
So what if you won't allow it?

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.120
