00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.450
You still have the nerve to smile.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.039
You heartless thing.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.400
When you can't make it out there anymore

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.150
and come crawling back
with your tail between your legs,

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.840
I will

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.710
give you a good scolding.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.169
Zhang Jiaming,

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:10.509
you lied to me.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.010
I thought you had really changed.

Let me tell you guys.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.570
I love bridges the most.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.630
Why's that?

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.750
I think bridges are magical things.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.190
They connect two different places.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.520
Shouldn't you prefer railways then?

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.920
Railways are different.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.560
Railways need tracks.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.090
No matter how far we want to go,

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.360
we can only
move forward along that track.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.560
You can't deviate even a bit.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.150
But bridges feel mysterious!

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.840
Even if the two sides aren't far apart,

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.710
I'm always curious
about what's on the other side.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.340
But...

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.800
don't both sides look the same?

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.810
I grew up near the old factory.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.920
I came from the old factory
to the East Chemical Plant.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.530
I actually know where I want to go

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.020
and what I want to do.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.080
Nothing to be curious about.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.790
But I've never known
what Tiecheng looks like.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.150
I can't help but imagine

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.270
what beautiful things,

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.480
fun things, and delicious food are there.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.750
Our factory has everything we need.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.150
What's so good out there?

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.330
Xiaodan, what do you think?

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.510
I like the Mahavira Hall

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:45.240
because it's the highest place
in our factory.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.950
Standing there, you can see
not only our factory

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.040
but also the distant mountains.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.430
If it were higher,

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.950
we could see
what's in those far-away places.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.070
Anyway, whatever,

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.240
no other place is as good as our factory.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.000
I'm not talking to you anymore.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.400
You don't know anything.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.220
Traitor!

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.950
Xiaoman!

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.720
Xiaoman!

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:04.870
Zhang Xiaoman!

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.930
Zhang Xiaoman!

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.330
Just like my dad!

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.560
Why are you running so fast?

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.240
I'm not talking to you guys anymore!

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.510
This is so worrying.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.160
Where could they have gone?

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.800
You're lucky.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.950
Yours are boys.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.670
Mine's a girl. I'm even more worried.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.430
Yan, what did the school say?

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.490
Alright, I've found out everything.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.830
The kid named...

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.090
Wang Dongdong told me.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.560
Jiaming left, didn't he?

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.800
Xiaoman insisted on finding his father.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.450
Xia Lei and Xiaodan went with him.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.040
The three of them
must be together right now.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.920
What if the kids have gotten lost
in the mountains?

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.000
What if they have nothing to eat or drink

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.159
in the mountains late at night?

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:46.630
Then we'll just have to go look for them.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:47.830
Don't panic, everyone.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:48.430
Stay calm.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:49.840
Let me think. Let me think.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:50.950
Here's what we'll do.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:51.680
We'll split up.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.310
You drive to Tiecheng.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.950
Okay.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:54.390
Alright?

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.190
Between Tiecheng and the bus station,

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.310
search several times,

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.750
okay?

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:58.950
I'll get some people

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.510
to search for them
in the mountains, alright?

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:01.710
Then I'll go with you.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.000
Don't make things more difficult.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.120
Just stay home.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.270
Someone needs to be at the house.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.190
What if they come back?

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.610
Right.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.110
You two as well. Go home.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.390
Right.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.920
Okay?

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:09.680
Wait for my news.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.390
Alright. Let's go.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:11.000
I...

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:12.560
What if they come back?

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.680
We'll keep in touch

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.940
and update each other.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.310
Move! Everyone move!

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.190
Kids, hide!

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.310
Mr. Ding is back!

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.680
Quick! Quick!

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.000
Kids, quick!

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.630
Good luck, Mr. Ding!

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:23.800
Go home for your meals!

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.630
Good luck, Mr. Ding!

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:25.960
No problem! No problem!

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.360
Alright! Alright!

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:33.620
Hurry up, come on.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.510
I-I know.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.560
Right away. Right away.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.310
What do you mean by "right away"?

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.270
I just got an injection at the hospital.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.830
Hurry up, come on.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:38.430
What are you doing?

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.680
Come on. What is it?

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.750
Don't.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.730
Close the curtains!

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:45.360
Curtains! Curtains!

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.780
Let me take it off. Let me.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.020
This neck warmer is too tight.

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.159
Is it too tight?

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.530
Well, I made it tight
so the wind won't get in.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:54.860
It's not the right time.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.510
Nose, your nose.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.800
Attention, comrades! Attention!

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:02.480
Children from our factory

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.310
have gone missing!

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:05.950
Probably in the mountains.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:07.880
We need volunteers to help search!

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.310
You go make a meal.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.310
I'll go with you.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:17.790
What for? Stay home.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.650
You came as well.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:21.750
-Yan, don't worry.
-Thank you. Really.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:22.630
-Don't worry.
-Thank you. Really.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.120
We'll definitely find the children.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.190
Don't worry. Don't worry.

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:25.830
Don't worry.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:26.360
Thank you.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.760
We'll search right away.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.930
You just got an injection.
Why did you come?

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:31.750
Children are missing.
How could I not come?

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:32.270
Come on, give me one.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:32.930
Here, here.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.240
Take 2 batteries,

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:35.710
in case it runs out of power.

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:36.440
Don't worry.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.270
Take it slow.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.390
Slow down. Slow down.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.500
Can we rest here?

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.070
I can't go on.

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:48.270
Let's sit for a while.

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:51.280
Stop walking.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.159
Let's find a place to hide.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.920
Where can we hide?

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.800
Are we going to spend the night outside?

00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.560
I'm scared.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.110
It's okay, Xiaodan.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:02.450
Xia Lei and I are here.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:05.070
Xia Lei.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.000
Look, is that a cave?

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.290
It seems like it.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.040
Let's go in and see.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:09.570
Let's go.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.330
Take it slow.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:19.660
Ma'am.

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.750
How's it going? Have they found them?

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.080
There are men searching

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:25.630
all over the mountains,

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:26.430
looking everywhere.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:27.240
Don't worry.

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:29.150
We were just afraid you'd be worried,

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:30.750
so I came back to check on you.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.549
But what about the children tonight?

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:35.360
It's alright, Ma'am.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:37.210
Haven't you eaten yet?

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:39.510
It's fine.

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:41.460
Let me make you something to eat.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.600
No need. No need.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.120
Don't worry. They'll find them.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.320
Tell them to search faster.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.200
They are. Everyone's searching.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.240
Don't worry. I'll prepare

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.840
some food for you right away.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.080
This cave is too deep.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.430
Maybe we should go back.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.880
Victory is just ahead.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.910
It's all your fault for running around
and getting us into the mountains.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.790
Great. Now we're completely lost.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:04.390
Xiaoman, are we really
sleeping here tonight?

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:06.870
We can't go back anyway.

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:08.200
Even though we're lost.

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:10.020
If we go back, my grandma will find out,

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.440
and she definitely won't let me come out
to find my dad again.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.300
Exactly. My dad definitely
won't let me come again.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:16.790
Just follow me.

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:20.950
We'll rough it here for one night.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.140
When it's light, we'll go find my dad.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.480
If you don't want to go,

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.480
I'll go by myself.

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.080
I need to ask him in person

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.320
why he abandoned me.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:30.690
Xiaoman!

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.080
Xiaoman, where are you?

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:32.720
Xiaoman!

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.750
Xia Lei, where are you?

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:34.600
Xiaoman!

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.790
Xiaoman! Xiaoman!

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:36.680
Xiaodan!

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.550
Xiaoman!

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.630
Xiaodan!

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:40.510
Xia Lei!

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:41.840
Xiaoman!

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.510
-Xiaodan!
-Xia Lei!

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:44.080
Xiaodan!

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.080
Xiaoman!

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:51.580
I wonder
how chaotic things are at home now.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.610
My mom's gonna kill me when I get home.

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:56.360
Xia Lei.

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:59.070
I feel like I got you into this.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.390
Why don't you just blame it on me?

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:02.200
No way.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.390
If I say that,

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:06.150
chances are that my mom

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:08.070
will never let me hang out
with you guys again.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:09.160
Then forget it.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Xia Lei, you're such a good student.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.730
And your mom is still so strict.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.550
Why do you always
want to hang out with us?

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:22.480
Because I think my mom
is more like a railway.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.400
No matter how far I am from her,

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.900
she has everything arranged for me.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:28.230
What are you guys doing?

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:30.070
Keep talking. I'm listening.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:30.870
Where were we?

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:32.840
Railway.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:33.600
Right. Railway.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.150
You guys are more like that arched bridge.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.510
Hanging out with you,

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:40.240
I always encounter
something magical, strange,

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.990
and unfamiliar.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.000
I haven't really met your mother,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:44.960
but when it comes to

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.750
arranging everything for others,

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.080
no one can beat my dad.

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.680
Every time he scolds me, he's like,

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.320
"You're a girl.
It's all for your own good."

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.380
You don't know how annoying my mom is.

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.670
Now that Xiaoman's seen her so many times,

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:00.040
my mom doesn't even hold back
when she scolds me.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:00.510
Xiaoman, where are you?

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:01.270
Xia Lei!

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:02.670
Xiaodan!

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:03.600
Shine the light up there.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.320
Xia Lei!

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.860
Use that thing and wave it around.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.340
See if we can hear the kids.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:08.600
These little rascals.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.790
Xiaodan! Xiaoman!

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:11.360
-Xiaoman!
-Have you found them?

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.080
No!

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:17.700
Xia Lei.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:20.750
Actually, when I was 6,

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.550
my mom left the factory.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:24.360
I've heard of it.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.200
Most of the time, I blame my dad.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.550
I think because of him,

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:32.110
my mom left.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.860
Sometimes, I blame my mom too.

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:38.800
Is the outside world really so good

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:41.970
that she had to see it
even if it meant leaving me behind?

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:50.870
Xiaoman.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.600
Maybe

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:57.970
your parents will come back someday.

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:00.230
Maybe they didn't abandon you.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:01.890
Actually, I blame myself too.

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:05.200
Because I wasn't good enough,

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.240
they left me behind

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:09.790
and left the factory.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:15.090
Stop crying first.

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:17.960
I think you're not wrong, Xiaoman.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.690
You have to trust me.

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:23.920
You're actually right about some things.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.910
Maybe your parents had no choice.

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:31.000
Don't change yourself
because of other people.

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:32.430
Don't cry.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.870
Thank you, Xia Lei.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.480
Let's be best friends forever.

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:39.360
Forever.

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:58.280
Slow down. It's steep here.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.010
How did we come here?

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:12.430
Why are there so many graves on this hill?

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.150
This is the factory's public cemetery.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:15.330
My grandfather is buried here.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:16.730
I know where to go now.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:17.470
Follow me.

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:19.240
This time, I believe you.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.790
Who else would you believe if not me?

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:21.670
We're here.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.930
Look at you two. Like little mud monkeys.

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:27.280
Little spotted cat.

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:28.740
You have a painted face.

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.000
-I'm not.
-You must be.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:30.960
I'm Monkey Sun.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.290
-The factory is starting to work!
-You are a monkey.

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:39.390
♪ The five-star red flag
is flying in the wind ♪

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:40.550
Stop singing.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.360
I need to wash my face.

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:43.600
My grandma is very particular
about cleanliness.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.240
If I don't wash up, she'll scold me.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.840
Can't you wash up when we get back?

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.550
No. You guys go ahead.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.750
Hurry up.

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:57.390
Help me!

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.800
-Xiaoman!
-Xiaoman!

00:13:59.080 --> 00:13:59.870
Help me!

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:00.480
Xiaoman!

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:02.660
-Xiaoman! Xiaoman!
-Xiaoman!

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.440
-Xiaoman! Xiaoman!
-Xiaoman!

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:07.960
-Is anyone there?
-Is anyone there?

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.270
Someone is drowning!

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:12.790
Xiaoman!

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.270
Xiaoman!

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.230
Xiaoman!

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.670
Come here, Xiaoman!

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:18.960
Someone help!

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:36.790
Come!

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:37.560
Xiaoman.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:40.790
Xiaoman.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:42.700
Xiaoman.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:44.670
Xiaoman.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.520
-Xiaoman.
-Xiaoman.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:49.260
Go!

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:53.930
Don't worry, Auntie.

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:55.030
I've already talked to my wife about it.

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:56.960
She's been thinking about him too.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.700
She's fond of this kid.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.600
He'll be fine after getting some rest.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.530
About this matter with his father,

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:03.480
don't overthink it.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.840
Jiaming is such a scoundrel.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.550
He forgets his mother
after getting married.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:07.630
The boy must have acted impulsively.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.390
Grandma, is my dad back?

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.560
Grandma, is my dad back?

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:14.410
He's awake.

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:17.060
Uncle Ding.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.240
I've already told your grandma.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.580
From now on, come to me with any problems.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:25.630
If you're bullied at school or anything,

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:27.000
tell me directly, got it?

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:27.630
I got it.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.920
Your grandfather and I were both soldiers.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.630
Your father and I are fellow disciples.

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:32.510
No matter who else abandons you,

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:33.860
I'll be there for you, understand?

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:34.920
Yes, I understand.

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:39.310
Come here. Let me feel your muscles.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.360
This won't do.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.620
Your build is too weak.

Watch yourselves.

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:45.160
What's wrong with that guy?

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:45.920
Watch ourselves?

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.070
Just because he's in a higher grade,

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:49.030
he always bullies those younger than him.

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:50.030
Don't be like him.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.240
What a real achiever.

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:52.320
Let's go.

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:54.160
-Let's go!
-My jacket!

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:55.490
Go home and get changed.

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:56.310
It's expensive!

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:57.270
Look at you!

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:58.750
Don't tear it!

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.680
Are you trying to be a wheeler-dealer?

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.340
Hurry up and go home to change!

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.400
Isn't that Zhuang Sen?

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.200
Go change.

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:10.000
Nothing in the school rule says
I can't wear this.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.330
You're so annoying!

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.880
He's running away!

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:17.030
I'll expel you!

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:18.460
I don't care!

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:21.590
I...

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.090
Zhuang Sen is truly
our factory's most fashionable guy.

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:25.600
Class is starting. Let's go.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:26.830
He's quite fluent in English.

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:28.240
"I don't..." How did he say it?

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.480
"I don't care."

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:33.450
Quiet down!

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:42.830
[Tong Yue'e]

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.200
Hello, everyone.

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:49.800
I'll be your homeroom teacher
for the next two years.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.790
Just call me Ms. Tong.

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:55.830
I'll help you get fully prepared
for the college entrance exam.

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:56.480
Bravo!

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.090
Hello, Ms. Tong.

00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.960
Alright.

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:03.500
First, I'd like to introduce a new student
to you.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.830
She's Meng Ge, transferred from Beijing.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:11.610
Hello everyone, I'm Meng Ge.

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:13.750
It's a real pleasure
to be in the same class as you.

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:14.950
Hope we'll get along.

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:22.560
You've all seen the seating chart
on the blackboard, right?

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.050
This seating arrangement

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:25.380
was made based on

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:28.030
your Grade 10 final exam results,

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:29.980
your height, and eyesight.

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:32.570
For those sitting in the back,
don't be discouraged.

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:33.500
The chart

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.030
will be adjusted
according to your performance

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:37.350
in each monthly exam.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:38.920
As students,

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.810
your positions can be changed
through study.

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:44.720
When you leave school
and step into the real world,

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.980
you'll understand that all good results

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.130
come from hard work.

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:49.400
Alright.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:53.790
Next, let's select class representatives.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.920
Today, I'll appoint

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.270
certain students

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.000
based on my knowledge of you.

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:03.830
Should you have complaints about them
in the future,

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:05.290
we'll hold a new election.

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:07.400
I've picked Xia Lei,

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:10.370
since he ranked first
in the previous grade exam.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:19.760
Yan Xiaodan, a versatile fellow of yours,
is chosen as well,

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.090
together with Meng Ge,

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:30.250
a well-rounded student new to our class.

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:35.830
They will each be assigned

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.650
different responsibilities.

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:45.960
You're back, Lei.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:46.640
Hello, sir.

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:48.510
Honey!

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.640
Where's the vinegar I just bought?

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:52.920
Right on the counter.

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:53.720
I didn't move it.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:54.980
Where did you place it?

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:56.550
Gosh.

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:57.590
Come help me find it.

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:59.790
What are your eyes for, eating noodles?

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.070
Hurry up. I need it right now.

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:01.870
Welcome back.

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.310
Good to see you back, Lei.

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:10.640
Did you even look for it?

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:13.910
Lei, we're having chicken drumsticks
for dinner!

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:20.750
He's not responding.

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:22.910
Cover for me and stir fry.

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:28.870
Lei, I'm serving chicken drumsticks
tonight.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:30.460
Yes, I heard you.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.650
Our son seems to be in a bad mood.

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:39.810
Go check on him.

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:40.760
He's fine.

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:42.380
Just go check on him.

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:44.060
Hurry.

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.920
Son.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:47.790
What happened?

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:50.030
I didn't get to be

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:52.660
the class president or the study monitor.

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:54.960
I only ended up
being the sanitation monitor.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.360
Sounds like a decent job.

00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:58.920
At least it means you've got

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.790
the teacher's attention, right?

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:03.680
The study monitor's grades
aren't even as good as mine,

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.080
but she still got the job
because her father is Director Meng.

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:08.920
I'm telling you, Son,

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:11.550
everyone has to walk his or her own path.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:12.960
It seems opaque at young ages,

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.160
but all becomes clear

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.140
when you grow into adults.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:18.550
One's life is built
through his or her own efforts.

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:21.030
Perhaps you do outperform
the study monitor academically,

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:22.400
but she's more sophisticated.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.480
Here's an analogy.

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:25.480
On a rainy day,

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.680
everyone's waiting at the same bus stop

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:29.670
probably for different vehicles.

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.550
Some people are waiting for private cars

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:32.680
that quickly arrive

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.480
and pick them up.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.640
Others are waiting for buses.

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:37.510
The wait could be long,

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:39.240
and the ride may be rough.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.350
With luck, they might meet up again
down the road.

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:42.070
But some others

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:43.510
can't even get on a bus.

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:46.790
Such is the gap
that separates one person from another.

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:48.320
If you are to narrow the gap,

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.640
you need to work hard.

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:52.310
What's wrong?

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:55.200
Don't be disheartened.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.660
Our family's neither the best
nor the worst.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.310
For what it's worth,

00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:59.590
your father and I are able

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:00.830
to provide you with a proper environment

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:02.090
where you can study without worries.

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:04.070
Son, just stay down-to-earth

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:05.270
and study hard.

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:08.400
Good grades will bring you
good opportunities, right?

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.330
Then you'll get to create a new life

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:11.990
and reach a higher position.

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:15.290
I just hope you won't end up
like your dad and me.

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:15.940
You see,

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:19.480
we've spent our entire lives
working in the East Chemical Plant.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.640
Yes, don't be like us.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:21.590
I agree with your mother.

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:22.110
Son,

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.480
as long as you remain
the top student of your school,

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.070
you'll practically

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:27.630
have a foot in
one of the most prestigious universities

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:29.020
in Beijing

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:31.480
or Shanghai.

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:33.140
A-Am I saying it

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:34.340
wrong?

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:36.450
No. You're making perfect sense.
Why the smirk?

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:37.750
I'm picturing something funny.

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:39.070
If one foot is in Beijing,

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:40.240
and the other in Shanghai,

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.110
h-his two legs will be so widely

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:44.260
stretched apart
that his groin might get hurt.

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:45.430
Stop rambling on.

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:46.640
That's a real risk.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:47.970
Your mom doesn't get it.

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.030
Alright then.

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:51.000
Help me set up the table now.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.400
Come on. Dinner's ready.

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:53.760
Hurry up.

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:55.640
You should come out too.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.030
Have dinner before eating fruit.

00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:58.270
Come on.

00:27:58.270 --> 00:27:59.800
Have you washed your hands?

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:00.400
-Not yet.
-Be quick!

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:01.730
Set up the table with me.

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:02.930
Can't you straighten your back?

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:04.990
Slouching like a shrimp all the time.

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:07.400
Xiaoman, why the rush?

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:09.680
Do you know how much
Xiaoman's grandma loves him?

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:10.310
How much?

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:11.310
She gives him
as much allowance as he wants.

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:12.110
Seriously?

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:13.920
His grandma really dotes on him.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:14.720
Indeed.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:15.680
After all, both his parents passed away,

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.310
and he is the only family she's got.

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:18.840
Hurry. The bell's ringing.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.310
Xiaoman! Xiaoman!

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:24.950
Come over!

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.600
For what?

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:26.320
Just come.

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:28.800
I wonder what's going on.

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:31.630
What's up?

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:33.440
Xiaobo wants to see you.

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:35.570
What's the matter?

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.270
Would you lend me 100 yuan?

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:37.920
How much?

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:39.550
One hundred?

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:41.880
I doubt if my family's stall
is even worth 100 yuan.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.070
How am I supposed to lend you that much?

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:44.070
Ask your grandma for it.

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:45.270
Doesn't she love you?

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.110
You can steal, rob, or borrow.

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:48.240
Do whatever you can.

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:51.200
My grandma can't give me that much money,

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.330
though she loves me.

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:53.680
Besides, honestly,

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.590
there isn't even 100 yuan
at home for me to steal.

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:56.440
Why do you ask me for it?

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.880
You should borrow from someone else.

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.610
I insist on borrowing from you,

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.080
since you're a pushover.

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:02.750
All the other students have parents.

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:03.790
But what about you?

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:05.480
Your family runs a lowly street stall.

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.540
Who else am I going to bully if not you?

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.400
Well...

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.570
Buddy, how about this?

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:19.310
My family's newsstand just bought
a batch of old books

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:20.770
from the factory library.

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:22.830
I'll get you one.

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:24.770
What book?

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.550
Guidance for the Newlyweds.

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:27.550
I'm not getting married.

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:28.590
Why would I need it?

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:29.110
Xiaobo,

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:30.480
that book comes with

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:31.440
pictures.

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:36.680
Pictures?

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:38.650
Colored pictures.

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:41.720
Bring it to me tomorrow.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:42.240
Sure.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:43.320
No problem.

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.270
I'll bring it to you tomorrow.

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:45.000
I'm leaving.

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:47.490
Don't forget that 100 yuan!

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:53.230
Okay.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.200
What did Feng Xiaobo want with you?

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.800
Nothing. Just a random chat.

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.480
Word has it that he often extorts
students in lower grades for money.

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:04.550
Let me know if he bullies you.

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:05.590
I'll have my brother beat him up.

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:06.480
No need.

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.400
He should be glad that I don't

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.820
bully him, that tiny little thing.

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:10.820
Then what did he chat with you about?

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.160
He asked for some nice books
from my family's newsstand.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.710
What nice books could

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:16.880
someone like him be into?

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:17.640
Yeah.

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.300
Just "nice" books.

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:22.590
Good for him.

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:23.870
D-Do you have any of those?

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:24.600
You want one?

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.400
Come on. Time to go home.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:26.930
Let's go.

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.200
"Nice" books indeed.

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.030
Grandma!

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:38.830
-Let me do it. It’s raining.
-You’re back.

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:39.750
It's raining. Hurry.

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:40.240
Let me do it.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.240
Pack up the stuff.

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:43.230
I'll finish this up.

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:45.960
Xia Lei, hurry. It's raining.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:46.920
Grandma, don't stay outside.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:48.610
-It’s raining.
-Grandma, don’t get wet.

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:49.960
Be quick with the packing.

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.070
Alright. I'll go home
to make you stewed beans.

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.590
Okay.

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.940
-You go home first, Grandma.
-Take care.

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:58.110
Where did I put it?

00:30:58.760 --> 00:30:59.820
What are you doing?

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:01.510
Looking for something.

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:02.970
I'm back for the money box.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:04.720
Grandma, stay out of the rain.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.480
Go home now.

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.540
It's raining. Had better leave soon.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.170
Are you not done with it yet?

00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:19.400
I'm waiting for you.

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.030
Why?

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:20.890
Just go home.

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:22.790
I can't walk that far without your help.

00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:23.920
Okay. I'll be right with you.

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:24.960
Be quick. It's raining.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:25.890
I found it. I did.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:27.510
Get out of the rain,

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.840
Grandma.

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.790
I'm fine. It's just a drizzle.

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:39.130
Xiaoman, hurry up!

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.770
It's going to pour soon.

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:41.690
Let's go.

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:43.400
I'll close the door.

00:31:57.890 --> 00:31:59.620
Lei, it's time to go to bed.

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:00.510
Stop studying.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.330
Yes, right away!

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:06.880
Xiaoman.

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.930
Be quick.
I'll wait for you at the school gate.

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.000
There you are.

00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:17.770
Where's the stuff?

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:18.680
Right here.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.640
What about the money?

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:27.640
That... I

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:29.250
don't have.

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:30.570
You don't?

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:32.640
Are you messing with me?

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:33.960
-Well...
-Don't get physical.

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:34.830
I've got money on me.

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:35.920
You stay out of it.

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:36.640
Get in the room.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:37.440
This is none of your business.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.030
What do you mean?

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:38.720
You want to die or what?

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.270
No, no, no.

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:40.310
P-P-Please don't hurt me.

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:41.000
I'll get you the money.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.030
I-I brought it here.

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:43.960
Let me get it for you. Just a second.

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:44.760
Give him mine.

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:47.030
Wait. What are you doing?

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:48.690
Why not just give him my money?

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:50.250
I bet you have a death wish!

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:51.250
Stop right there!

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:52.330
Don't you dare run!

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:54.710
-Stop!
-What's going on?

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:56.890
Stay where you are!

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:57.760
Stop running!

00:32:58.030 --> 00:32:59.070
I'll crush you!

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:00.070
Stop right there!

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.640
Run, huh?

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:02.310
Let's talk this through.

00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:03.370
Talk this through?

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:04.630
Will you even listen?

00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:05.790
I will.

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:07.320
Did I not talk nicely to you?

00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:08.680
Did you listen?

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:10.970
Don't come any closer.

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.080
Or I'll jump.

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:13.270
You'll jump?

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:15.830
Okay. Do it now.

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:17.420
Jump. I'm watching.

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.040
Jump, now!

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:22.650
I just recalled it.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:24.600
You should call me Uncle.

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.320
We're actually related.

00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:27.440
And I'll say I'm your dad's brother.

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:28.200
Related? What a lame excuse.

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.200
No, I mean it.

00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:30.830
My second uncle's

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:34.270
daughter-in-law's brother's mother-in-law
is your great-aunt.

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:35.240
What's this noise about?

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.350
Feng Xiaobo is in trouble.

00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:37.530
He extorted Xiaoman and ended up

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:38.550
being beaten.

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:43.640
Make way!

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:44.700
Let me get through!

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:47.070
Is that so?

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:47.440
Yes!

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.680
We're relatives, aren't we?

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.640
You mean my great-aunt...

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:50.030
Right.

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:51.400
You big liar!

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:51.790
I'm serious...

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:53.720
Don't you mess with Xiaoman again!

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:57.720
You'll pay for this!

00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:59.400
Shut up!

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.310
Why did you do that?

00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:02.590
Because he bullied you.

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:03.980
But... My goodness.

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:06.430
Wait and see!

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:08.510
The water splashed on me.

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:09.570
How dare you laugh?

00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:11.449
Why didn't you fight him?

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:13.710
Feng Xiaobo was already cornered
like a rat.

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:15.000
I didn't get a chance to fight him.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:15.730
Are you okay?

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:19.860
You're really something.

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:21.030
And why are you this happy?

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:23.159
Why didn't you tell us he picked on you?

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.880
It was not worth mentioning.

00:34:25.219 --> 00:34:27.219
The problem has gone with the water.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:29.070
Don't you hide

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:30.190
anything from us again.

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:31.790
Just tell us if you need help.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.110
Are you still confused
about what happened?

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:35.440
What exactly happened?

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:36.510
Impressive, Xiaodan.

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:37.800
You're a true heroine.

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:46.110
Grandma!

00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:48.400
I'm home.

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:51.880
We're having dumplings today?

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:53.510
Let me help.

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:57.750
Pickled vegetables.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.860
Put more meat in, Grandma.

00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:06.920
Do you know what you've done?

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:14.510
What have I done?
I'm just back from school.

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:15.320
Confess now!

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:16.650
You attacked someone!

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:17.530
What's the matter, Grandma?

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:18.860
Who taught you all that?

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.280
Since when have you become like this?

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.110
Like what?

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:23.580
You hit someone with a bat today.

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:25.360
Will you wield a knife tomorrow?

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.510
Grandma, ignore those rumors.

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:28.240
Feng Xiaobo is a troublemaker.

00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:30.780
He's a troublemaker...

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:32.360
Come over here!

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:34.800
Can it justify your use of violence?

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.510
Are you expecting me, an old woman,

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:38.970
to bail you out of police detention
someday?

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.630
No.

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:41.510
Grandma, d-don't be mad.

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:42.510
Don't listen to their nonsense.

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:43.920
I won't do it again. I know I was wrong.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.120
You won't do it again?

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:49.690
Xiaoman,

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:52.590
young trees

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:55.760
won't grow straight without pruning.

00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:58.490
The same applies to young people.

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.240
Growing slowly is not a problem,

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:04.030
but growing crooked is.

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:07.910
Grandma, don't worry.

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.760
I assure you I won't grow crooked.

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:11.880
If you ever find me growing the wrong way,

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:12.840
discipline me immediately,

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.440
beat me up, and reprimand me.

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:19.590
Grandma, I know you're the best.

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:21.360
Grandma, p-please stop being mad.

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.220
Don't be upset.

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.480
I-I won't make the same mistake.

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:24.810
Just don't worry, okay?

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:26.590
Let's make dumplings and cook.

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:27.400
I'm starving.

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:31.480
Grandma, rest assured.

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.920
Please don't be mad.

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:33.980
Alright. Fine.

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:34.840
I got it.

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:37.280
I'll roll the dough.

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:41.710
Actually,

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:45.930
it's a good thing that you have the guts
to stand up to bullies.

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.070
Children of the Zhang family

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:51.670
must not be bullied by anyone.

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:53.920
A man shouldn't

00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:58.060
prove his worth with his fists,

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:01.280
but with his wits.

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:02.670
Got it?

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.070
Got it.

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:06.840
I understand.

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:10.590
Let's make dumplings and cook.

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:17.660
This year's school variety show
will commence soon.

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:19.910
Given the tight schedule

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:20.920
of grade 12 students,

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:23.190
the task to perform has fallen on those
in 10th and 11th grades.

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:24.190
Our class needs to

00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:25.430
put on a performance.

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:26.760
I've decided for you.

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:28.280
Just like when class representatives
were selected,

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:30.010
those two will be chosen again.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:32.960
Xia Lei,

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:34.230
Xiaodan,

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:36.800
the two of you will do
a poetry recitation.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.660
Discuss the content yourselves.

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:40.370
Submit it for my review later.

00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:41.920
Yes, Ms. Tong.

00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:43.040
What a perfect duo.

00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:45.170
Poetry recitation...

00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:46.550
Which poem to recite?

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.360
How about "If You Are Not Happy Enough"

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.710
by Wang Guozhen?

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.190
"If you are not happy enough,

00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:54.440
don't frown and knit your brows."

00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:56.870
But where is the sorrow from?

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.130
Yeah. Where is the sorrow from?

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:00.320
I think

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.070
at our age,

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:03.800
we shouldn't pretend to be melancholy.

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.440
What about his other poem,
"The View from Behind"?

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.880
"Always so simple—a silhouette."

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:10.790
-"So simple."
-That poem...

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:13.230
It was written

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:14.510
from a man's perspective.

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:15.590
It doesn't suit me.

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:18.280
Then how about...

00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:19.840
a poem from the Song dynasty?

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:20.840
What do you think?

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:22.040
Stop playing with the bike.

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.030
Come up with an idea for us.

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.840
Yes. We need your help.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:24.590
Don't bother me with that.

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:25.840
I'm not the one going to recite a poem.

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:26.480
What did you say?

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.670
Say that again, I dare you!

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:28.630
Fine. I'll start thinking.

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:29.560
Give me the bike!

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:31.190
I-I'll catch him for you!

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.800
I'm on it!

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:32.800
Give me the bike!

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:33.710
Why has he circled back?

00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:35.000
Come after me!

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:37.320
Grandma.

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:39.150
Grandma.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.000
Grandma.

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:44.090
What are you doing here?

00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:46.610
I'm watching this stall for someone.

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:48.580
Mrs. Zhang,

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:49.360
I'm back.

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:50.240
You're back.

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:51.140
Thank you.

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:52.190
Let's go back to our place.

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:53.190
You're welcome.

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:53.590
Alright.

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:54.510
I'll head back then.

00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:55.040
Let's go.

00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:55.670
Alright.

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:08.800
Why did you come back alone?

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:10.370
Where is Xia Lei?

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:12.890
Didn't he get off school with you?

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:14.600
Xia Lei...

00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:16.750
Xia Lei and Xiaodan went to rehearse

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:18.470
for a poetry recitation.

00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:21.070
I had nothing to do, so I came back.

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:25.880
You came home without them just for that?

00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:28.820
I wasn't of help to them.

00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:31.120
You silly boy.

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:32.880
Look,

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:34.920
I'm too old

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:36.630
to work

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:39.440
in the factory now.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
The staff there have been nice to us.

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.280
So, I'd often sew some small pads

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:46.510
for them to wipe their hands

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:48.260
or clean the machines and such.

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:51.230
It's like I'm fighting alongside
them, isn't it?

00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:57.700
Yes.

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:01.350
I can... deliver supplies
to my friends, right?

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:02.530
Exactly.

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:04.720
Stick around when they practice.

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:06.880
Hand them water when they need it.

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:08.720
That's right.

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.820
"The Revelation of Life."

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:15.250
[The Revelation of Life]

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:15.930
Xiaoman!

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:17.800
What are you doing?

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.070
Looking for supplies for my friends.

00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:22.110
You've got all my old books out.

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:23.930
Don't worry. I'll put them away.

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:25.280
Make sure you tidy up the place.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.010
Absolutely.

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:35.650
"Holding a Chinese lute in the arms."

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:48.670
"I must be a ceiba tree

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:51.360
beside you.

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:55.330
As a tree,

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.820
I'm standing together with you."

00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:01.770
Have some orange.

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:03.110
You startled me.

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:04.230
What's this for, Mom?

00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:05.070
I'm not eating it now.

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:06.150
Put it aside.

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:10.620
What are you writing?

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:13.070
"If I love you..."

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:15.880
I... Why did you take it?

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:16.360
This...

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:18.880
"If I love you..." What's this stuff?

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.070
It's a poem.

00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:24.370
Who's this?

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:27.430
Made... a line?

00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:28.390
Made... a line?

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:29.170
What's that?

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:31.640
You sound silly. It's an English name,

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:33.480
"Madeleine."

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:37.070
Who is this Madeleine?

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.360
A classmate of mine.

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.620
With an English name. Classy.

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:42.960
Alright then.

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:44.670
I'll ask your teacher tomorrow.

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:46.400
I must ask your English teacher
who this is.

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.730
P-Please don't do that.

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:49.500
Don't embarrass me at school.

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:50.500
Then tell me.

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:51.190
-Give it back to me.
-Tell me.

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:52.190
Who is this person?

00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:54.590
Tell the truth,
and I'll give it back to you.

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:55.880
Meng Ge!

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:57.440
Meng Ge.

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:01.360
You've read a lot of poetry.

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.480
Could you recommend a suitable poem for me

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:05.810
and Xiaodan to recite in the variety show?

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:09.730
A suitable poem should
resonate with you spiritually.

00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:12.050
Pick one from this collection.

00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:14.380
Choose the one that suits you
and you like.

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:16.630
It's my deskmate Meng Ge.

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:18.590
Director Meng's daughter?

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:19.800
I have to warn you.

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:22.060
Y-You'd better keep a distance from her.

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:24.230
What? What are you talking about?

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:25.150
I'm not...

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:26.400
You're making it sound like

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.400
there's something going on
between me and her.

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:28.240
What are you doing?

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:28.960
Don't take it away.

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.590
I'm keeping this for the night.

00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:32.030
You'll have it back tomorrow morning.

00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:32.960
When you get to school

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.180
tomorrow morning,
give it back to her right away.

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:36.800
Why? I haven't finished copying it.

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:37.480
-I'm only half way through.
-Then copy

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:38.590
your Chinese textbook instead,

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:39.280
or a study guide.

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:40.590
Make as many copies as you like.

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:42.360
Just don't waste time on this stuff.

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:43.800
Why should I copy a textbook?

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:45.150
Mom, g-give it back to me!
