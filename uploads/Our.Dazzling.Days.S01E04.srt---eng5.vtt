Just hand them out. Don't shout, okay?

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.710
Why can't I shout?

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:48.570

I'll pass.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.030
Take one.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.630
Hot off the press, huh?

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.760
You're hopeless.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.790
Who can hear you whispering like that?

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.120
Alright, I'll take one.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.280
Hey guys!

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.520

Zhuang Sen and Xiaoman are performing.
Make sure to come and support them.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.910
D-Do you have front row tickets?

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.400
Sure, let me look. Here.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.680

You bet. Take this.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.630
Well,

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.890
I want one more.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.579
Who are you taking?

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.050
Not sure yet.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.030
You'd better bring someone, okay?

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.520
These tickets are in high demand,
you know?

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.430
Don't let it go to waste.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.750
I'll try my best. I will.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.560
I'm going home now.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.630
-Alright.
-We're off.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.630
What are you talking about, fake tickets?
They're real.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.120
Remember to come.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.380

You've got to come.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.360
I'll take one for Sun Lulu.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.000
No, you've got to come as well, okay?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.630
Alright, alright.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.310
Give me one.

I'll take two.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.190
Your girlfriend really came through.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.050
What time is it?

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.030
What girlfriend?

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.030
S-She's the host for
our anniversary celebration.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.160
Three tickets. You three
have got to come and support us.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.210
Xiaodan.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.350
Xiaodan! Xiaodan!

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.910
Thanks for your hard work.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:17.910
It's nothing.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:19.840
Our factory's anniversary celebration
is coming up.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.040
Zhuang Sen and Xiaoman are performing.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.430
Anniversary celebration tickets...

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.890
I've got a brilliant idea.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.190
If this works out,

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.329
we'll make a big name for ourselves
at the East Chemical Plant.

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.030
Grandma will walk around like
she owns the place after seeing the show.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.190
Zhuang Sen and Xiaoman are performing.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.200
-You've got to come and watch.
-What is it?

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.150
-Mr. Ding.
-Mrs. Ding.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.120
Come on, show us your tickets.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.280
Tickets, please. Come on.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.079
Here, take this.

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.310
Go on in.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.300
-See you later.
-Alright.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.120
You're here so early.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.360
Look at all that sweat.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.680
Go on in.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.840
Come on, quick! Uncles and Aunties, hurry!

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.630
Hurry up and get on stage. Quick, quick.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.150
Come on.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.690
Quick, get the children down. Hurry.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.030
Be careful. Come on.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.160
Follow the teacher.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:53.680
Eyes forward.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.160
Let's stand by here.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.000
Come on.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.030
Fourth Sister-in-law, you look beautiful.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.470
Check out that outfit. You're really
getting prettier and prettier.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.520
Cut it out.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.160
Stay calm, alright?

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.460
Stay calm.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:09.440
I know, I know.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.710
Just wait quietly for that moment.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.080
Here you are.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.630
You're here.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.190
You're here.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.960
Quite early.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.600
Here, over here.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.269
Come on, sit down.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.390
He's a model worker, after all.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:21.269
Come on, stop teasing me.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.070
Is this the second row?

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.530
Yes, it is. The second row.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.760
The anniversary celebration is getting
less and less festive.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.270
Even a few firecrackers

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.780
would liven things up a bit.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.490
It's good enough
that we're still doing it.

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:33.120
Isn't it?

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.360
Firecrackers would cost extra.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.690
Haven't you seen the state of our factory?

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.590
How much could that possibly cost?

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.870
If we don't build up the morale,

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.420
we're bound to lose, you know?

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.780
Keep it down.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.720
It's good enough
that we're still doing it.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.050
It shows our factory hasn't gone bust yet.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.500
This lone garlic here's still got
30 more years of spice left.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.100
It's barely been a few years.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.360
Nervous?

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:21.630
Why would we be nervous?

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.240
No, we're just excited.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.430
Excitement is good.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.600
Make sure to be pumped
when you get on stage.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.040
Got it.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.630
By the great rivers,

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.480
we set sail for the future!

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.870
The low hum of machines
echoes through the valley.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.920
That's a huge turnout.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.360
It is the song of creation
for generations of Donghua people!

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.530
-We create miracles here.
-Why hasn't my grandma arrived?

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:02.690

-held up on the way.
-East Chemical Plant,

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.840
-It's okay. I'm sure she'll come.
-I'm proud of you!

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.840
Come on, let's go.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:13.310
I'm honored to be part of you!

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.560
Donghua people united,

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.360
forging the glory of our motherland!

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.800
Bravo!

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.300
Bravo! Bravo!

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.560
Thank you for the thunderous applause.

What kind of setup is this?

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:17.670
They've only sung two lines.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.210
Why did they stop singing?

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:21.830
Why did the lights go out?

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.270
Well, the youngsters

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.430
are probably
experimenting with something new.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.290

Come on, let's go. Hurry!

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:29.550
Xiaoman! Xiaoman! Xiaoman!

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:30.390
Stop dancing!

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:36.560
Get down here!

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.920
What's happening?

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:41.870
Xiaoman!

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:42.800
What's going on?

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:49.320
I can walk.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.190
Move. Come on.

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:51.240
C-Can't I watch for a while?

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:51.960
Easy, okay?

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:54.120
Get out.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.600
C-Can't I just watch for a bit?

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.200
What's there to watch?

00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.600
Take these.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:01.350
Hurry up and leave. Close the door.

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.350
You really don't understand anything!

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:04.010
Seriously.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:06.530
Unbelievable.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:11.900
This is just great.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.670
Dirty clothes.

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:16.600
Nothing left.

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:19.910
Don't lose heart, Xiaoman.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.630
The birth of new things

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.040
is often questioned.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.840
To light up the darkness before dawn

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:26.910
takes courage.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.420
Don't you think I'm a poet?

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:31.520
I even rhymed.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:35.840
What's wrong?

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.440
We worked on this for so long.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.440
I just wanted my grandma

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.120
to see me sing here.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.380
Why is it so hard, huh?

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.500
Well, that's easy.

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:45.790
I'll go home with you
and sing for your grandma.

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:47.300
We can sing it as many times as you want.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.820
How can that be the same?

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:49.960
Here we've got a stage,

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.840
music, lights, everything.

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:54.390
And an audience cheering for us.

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:56.390
Singing at home isn't even close.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.160
Get our classmates at your place,

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.760
and I'll play the accompaniment
for you again.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:04.270
Where is my grandma?

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:05.530
Why isn't she here yet?

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:08.240
-Right.
-Could she have forgotten?

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:08.630
She couldn't have.

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:10.560
I told her about this so many times.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:11.970
I'll go home and check.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:12.970
Come on, let's go.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:25.030
Grandma.

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:27.730
Grandma?

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.100
Where could she have gone?

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.480
Grandma? Where are you?

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.670
Look at this. The show is over.

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:58.000
Grandma.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.290
Grandma?

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:13.850
You've finished watching the show, Uncle?

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:14.490
Xiaoman.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.160
What's going on here?

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.810
What are you looking at?

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:19.650
It's nothing.

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:20.320
It's nothing.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.320
What do you mean, nothing?

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.150
What happened?

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:23.220
Take it easy, alright?

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:23.670
What are you looking at?

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:25.000
Come on, let us through.

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:25.870
Xiaoman.

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:27.070
Why is my grandma here?

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:27.950
Xiaoman...

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:29.060
Xiaoman...

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.690
It's okay, Xiaoman.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.410
We're all here with you.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.280
Take a look at your grandma.

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:38.600
Grandma.

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:40.440
Grandma.

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:53.270
Grandma, let's go... Let's go home.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.130
What are you doing here, Grandma?

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:55.890
Grandma?

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:00.030
What... What happened to her?

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:01.670
This...

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.070
Your grandma is gone.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.850
That's impossible. She just came out...

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:08.780
She just came out to watch the show.

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:11.240
How could she...

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:11.790
Grandma.

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:12.720
Grandma.

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:17.080
Grandma, let's go home.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.000
The sweater isn't finished yet.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:18.690
Let's go. Let's go.

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:19.220
Grandma.

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:21.320
The sweater is only half done.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.120
I haven't had a chance to wear it.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:28.360
Xiaoman...

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.490
We can go home.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.850
Grandma, let's go home.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.680
-Xiaoman, don't…
-Grandma.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.200
She can't go home with you anymore.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.510
Xiaoman.

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:46.090
Pull yourself together. Come on.

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:47.300
Let's...

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:49.350
Everyone, please help.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:50.390
Let's get Grandma home.

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:51.390
Give us a hand. Come on.

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:52.320
Xiaoman. Xiaoman.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.580
You're a grown man now.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:54.720
Get up first.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.540
Your grandma...

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:56.330
Xiaoman.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:58.750
-She didn't suffer.
-Listen to me, Xiaoman.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:00.960
C-Can you just listen to me?

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:01.670
Xiaoman.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.200
Grandma didn't suffer, alright?

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:07.250
Come on, get up.

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:09.200
Come on. Let's take Grandma home.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.130
Get up, Xiaoman.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.000
Be good. Be good, Xiaoman.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:12.510
Come on.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:13.390
Be good.

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:14.250
Come on.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:15.550
Come on, everyone, give us a hand.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:16.390
Help us hold her. Come on.

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:18.320
We can't let Grandma just sit here.

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:19.200
Come on.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.020
Lend a hand.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:21.360
We're all here. We're all here.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:21.790
Let's go.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:23.010
-Easy.
-We're all here.

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:23.560
Come on.

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:28.600
Easy.

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.840
Careful. Easy, easy.

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:34.960
Get over here!

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:36.650
Are you a delinquent, too?

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:38.370
Do you want me, at my age,

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.130
to bail you out of jail someday?

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.510
It's not like that.

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:43.510
Grandma, d-don't be mad.

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:44.360
Don't listen to their nonsense.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.420
I won't do it again. I know I was wrong.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:48.840
Grandma!

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.000
Don't leave me!

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:51.000
Grandma!

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.920
-Xiaoman!
-Xiaoman!

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:53.470
Grandma!

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:54.640
What are you doing, Xiaoman?

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:55.240
Grandma!

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.360
Don't be like this, Xiaoman.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.120
Xiaoman.

00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:59.360
Xiaoman.

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:01.480
Xiaoman.

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:03.390
-Xiaoman.
-Xiaoman, be good!

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:04.550
Let's take Grandma home first.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:05.750
Xiaoman, be good.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:06.510
Xiaoman, no matter how hard you cry,

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:07.960
don't let your tears
fall on Grandma's face,

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:08.670
you know?

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.360
Or she won't be able to rest in peace.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.150
You know?

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:13.810
Don't take her away. Don't.

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:17.080
-Xiaoman!
-Xiaoman!

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.200
Let Grandma go!

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:21.750
Grandma.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:22.600
Grandma...

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.370
Be good.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:24.600
Hold him back.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:25.930
Grandma... Grandma...

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:27.930
Grandma...

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.120
-Xiaoman...
-Grandma is going home.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.670
-Xiaoman, don't...
-Xiaoman!

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:32.360
Don't go over there!

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.150
Xiaoman!

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:35.480
Come back, Xiaoman!

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.510
Xiaoman...

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:41.720
Xiaoman!

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:43.780
Xiaoman.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.400
Grandma... Grandma...

Xiaoman.

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:48.580
Grandma, let's go home.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.870
-Grandma.
-Come on. Push.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:51.630
Let Xiaoman push. Come on.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:53.270
Grandma... Grandma...

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:54.910
Let's go home.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.150
You,

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.110
just bless our grandson

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.840
to have a steady and safe life, alright?

Dad, you're so cruel.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.320
Grandma's gone,

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:12.150
and you didn't even come back
to bid her farewell.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.800
[East Integrated Chemical Plant]

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:25.960
Ding, it's really great that you want

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:27.140
to be Xiaoman's guardian.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:28.200
You don't know yet—

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:31.480
Jiaming had an accident in the south,
and he didn't make it.

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:35.200
I didn't know how to break it to him,

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.130
and now Xiaoman's grandma also...

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.280
Why did it all happen at once?

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.070
It's just that I still need to
handle some paperwork here.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:48.270
You go back and get the documents ready.

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:49.510
Proceed with it then.

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:51.440
Director Liu, Mr. Ding.

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:52.100
Xiaoman.

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:55.120
Well, my grandma

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.030
sewed some small cushions
for our factory.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:58.250
They just filled up a box,

00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:59.510
so I brought them over.

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:03.120
Ding.

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:05.230
Comrade He Yuexiang's grandson

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:06.540
is our family, too.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.670
Xiaoman, have your meals at the cafeteria
from now on.

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:12.900
Go whenever you like.

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:16.350
As for your daily expenses,

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.640
go to the finance office every month

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.500
to collect a 100-yuan allowance.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.720
Thank you, Director Liu.

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:23.720
Don't mention it.

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:25.430
You know,

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:27.160
your grandparents

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.090
were both first-generation workers
of our factory,

00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:31.690
and they left us so suddenly.

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:34.440
Don't think about your father.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.810
He's out there and can't come back.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:37.750
Also,

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.240
Mr. Ding here wants to be your guardian.

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:41.960
As for the paperwork,

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.360
it needs to be processed.

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:45.750
You can still collect the money yourself.

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:46.610
When you do,

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:48.290
keep a record of your spending

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:50.480
and remember to show it to Mr. Ding.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:53.550
It's not that
I want to control your spending.

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:53.960
Right.

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.440
You're young,

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:56.510
and you haven't seen
this much money before.

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:57.920
I'm worried you might spend it recklessly.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.790
Once you know how to manage it,
I won't interfere.

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:00.360
Okay.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.240
And one more thing.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.360
About the cafeteria,

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:07.240
eat there if you want, or don't.

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:09.350
Just come eat at my place.

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.620
If your aunt and I are too busy to cook,

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:14.220
then go eat at the cafeteria.

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:15.880
Thank you, Mr. Ding.

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:32.310
He's here.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:33.560
He's here.

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:36.240
He's here. He's here.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.100
He's here, huh?

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:52.460
Yeah, he's coming up the stairs.

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:53.460
Okay, wait there.

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:57.350
Xiaoman.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.110
You're here.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.070
Come on.

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:02.660
Wipe your hands and face.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.090
Smell this. Doesn't it smell good?

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:07.860
Mr. Ding.

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:08.960
Come on in.

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:11.410
Come on in. You, go peel a tangerine
and open a soda for him.

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:12.400
I don't need help here. Go.

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.070
Come on in, Xiaoman.

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.550
Come on in.

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:14.030
Look at...

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:15.960
Look at him tossing the wok.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:16.440
It'll be ready soon.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.510
You... Go inside.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.050
Have some water.

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:21.580
Okay.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:22.600
Tangerines!

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:23.670
Peel a tangerine.

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:24.720
Pick a big one.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:25.680
That one on top is good.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:26.510
Got it.

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:28.790
-Let me peel it for you.
-I'll peel it myself.

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:29.830
D-Don't worry about me.

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:31.160
I'm fine. Don't mind me.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:32.790
Have some water then.

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:33.310
Okay.

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.140
I'll go help him.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:36.830
Alright.

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:37.400
Where's the plate?

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.440
Coming, coming. The plate?

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.550
Here. Isn't it right here?

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:40.920
-Come on.
-I've washed it for you.

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:41.810
Isn't it right here?

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:42.680
You should've put it down earlier.

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.380
Next time, put it right in front of me.

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:45.350
Alright, alright, right in front of you.

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:46.680
So I don't have to look for it, you know?

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:47.240
Here.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:47.960
Come on.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:48.590
Let's eat.

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:49.160
Let's eat.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:49.750
Put this away.

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:52.010
We should stop wearing this
when we cook.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.400
Don't stand on ceremony.
Give him a pair of chopsticks.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:54.460
Come on, let's eat.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:55.960
Here.

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:57.140
Here you are.

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:00.160
What's wrong? Not to your liking?

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:00.960
No, it's fine.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.270
-Give him a bit extra. He's a big guy.
-Okay.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:03.110
Pile it high.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:07.360
That's enough.

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:07.750
Enough?

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:08.240
Yeah.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.870
-Eat more.
-Refill once he's done. Come on.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.010
Taste it. See if you like it.

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.910
Go easy on the alcohol.

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:16.590
You both eat more meat.

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:18.600
Here. Have a balanced diet.

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:20.920
I'm not fond of big chunks of meat.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:21.980
Bones are tastier.

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:23.790
He bought you this soda.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.460
-Drink some.
-Come on.

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:26.720
Eat plenty,

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:28.270
grow strong.

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.350
Fill it up,

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.510
grow tall.

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:33.970
Yours doesn't make sense.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.590
You want some too?

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:36.110
No.

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:37.070
No?

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:40.070
Let me fill it up for Xiaoman.

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:46.720
Go get some tissues.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.490
Eat up. Stop overthinking.

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:53.980
Everyone has their time.

00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.750
Have some of that dish. Come on.

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:01.340
Be good, alright?

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.920
Towel.

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:16.010
Eat up.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.310
Xiaoman, as long as you live well,

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:19.940
Grandma will be at peace in Heaven.

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:21.490
We're both here with you.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.300
I went to Mr. Ding's for dinner.

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.430
He gave me some extra food to take home.

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:29.070
Xiaoman.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:43.720
Auntie.

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:46.930
You'll catch a cold if you sleep here.

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:49.840
It's okay. I'm just napping here
for a bit.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.640
Want to rest a bit longer?

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:55.680
No, I'm good.

00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:57.990
What do you want to eat?

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:00.070
I'll go make you something warm.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:03.220
I'm not hungry.

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:05.800
Did Grandma knit this?

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:11.270
Yeah, it's too big.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.840
She only finished half of it.

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.380
She said I'd be able to wear it
next year...

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.570
I'll knit it for you.

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:22.760
You'll be able to wear it this year.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.030
G-Go lie down for a bit.

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:28.780
I'll go make you something delicious.

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:29.640
Go on.

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:42.640
Auntie,

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:44.680
rest assured.

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:46.590
We're all here.

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:48.280
We'll make sure to

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:49.770
take good care of Xiaoman.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.740
Xiaodan, what are you doing here?

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.330
Come on in.

00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:30.600
I wanted to check on you.

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.680
My mom asked me to bring you some food.

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:38.100
Come on, sit. Don't bother.

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:40.200
Let me see what you brought.

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:42.370
Steamed buns my mom made.

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:44.190
Look.

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:46.640
-They're still warm.
-They're really big.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.710
I've just made some rice.

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:49.870
Let's eat together.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.160
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:52.030
Don't worry about me.

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:53.160
What have you made?

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.440
Hot, hot, hot!

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:01.720
What is this?

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:02.400
Rice.

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.440
You're just eating plain rice?

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.900
I've got some cold dishes.

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.110
Cold dishes.

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:12.260
Let me get you some chopsticks.

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:14.790
You're not taking care of yourself
properly.

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:23.550
Here, let me do it. Don't burn yourself.

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:33.750
Here.

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:38.960
Have more buns.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.220
My mom made the filling

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:41.310
with lots of meat.

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:44.170
This rain is on and off.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:46.480
Xia Lei?

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.230
You're here.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.350
Haven't eaten yet, right?

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:49.510
I... I haven't eaten.

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:50.680
Come on, let's eat together.

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.140
Xiaodan just got here too.

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.910
My mom asked me to bring you some food.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.420
Freshly made by my dad. Take a look.

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:57.290
Let me see.

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:01.990
This smells really delicious.

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.920
Hurry up and eat.

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:09.150
Let me. Let me.

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:10.610
Xiaoman.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.200
You want me to help you

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:14.830
sort out your grandma's things?

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:16.560
No need. Just leave them there.

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:17.350
Just leave them here?

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:19.210
I feel at peace seeing them there.

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:20.880
I've washed the box clean.

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:24.790
Aren't you supposed to burn these for her?

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.360
I mean... Just burn them.

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.840
I was going to,

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:28.530
but then...

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.560
I brought them back.

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:32.650
Grandma used these all her life.

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:33.760
Why burn them?

00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:36.100
Yeah, keep them if you want.

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:38.360
You can look at them
when you miss your grandma.

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.290
Where was that photo taken?

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:43.630
In Shenyang, when my grandma
took me there.

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:45.020
I was still little then.

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:48.420
She said we'd snap one in Shenyang,

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:51.410
and when I grew up,
she'd take me to Beijing

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:53.280
and take one at Tian'anmen.

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:55.430
But that never happened.

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.540
Your grandma looked so young in this.

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:13.400
Xiaoman, setting up the stand?

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.000
Let me know if you need any help.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:16.630
Work hard, alright?

00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:17.960
Sure thing. Sure thing.

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:25.400
Xiaoman, here are some apples for you.

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.400
You're too kind, Sis.

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.200
Sis, have a soda.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:29.550
Sis.

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:30.900
No need. It's nothing.

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:35.110
I'm off work.

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:36.120
Ride safely.

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:45.370
Xiaoman.

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:46.310
What do you want to buy, bro?

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:47.550
Xiaoman, where did you go?

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:48.400
I went to deliver newspapers.

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.030
Deliver newspapers?

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:50.570
You were gone for about half an hour.

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:51.840
-No, I just left.
-Have you eaten?

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:52.270
Not yet.

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:52.760
Hurry up.

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:53.260
Just in time.

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:53.670
Quick.

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:55.510
Come on, sit here.

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:56.610
What is it?

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:59.310
My wife made some dumplings
this afternoon.

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:00.030
Dumplings?

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:01.180
She used the sauerkraut I made.

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:02.680
Thin wrappers, big filling.

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:03.110
I'll have a taste.

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.610
Eat up.

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:05.090
They're so good
you won't even have time to talk.

00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:06.000
My wife said

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:07.510
they taste just like the ones
your grandma used to make.

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:09.670
Taste it and see if it's the same flavor.

00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:11.670
Yeah, it really does taste similar.

00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:14.480
Well,

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:16.170
I-I'm glad it tastes similar.

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.000
Then I... I...

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:17.790
I'll be heading back now.

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:18.720
You go ahead and eat.

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.640
As for the box...

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:20.880
I-I'll bring it over in a bit.

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:21.940
Alright, alright.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.490
I had to put my foot in it.

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:27.490
Xiaoman.

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:28.680
By the way,

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.440
this is

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.260
the money from selling the newspapers
just now.

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:31.980
I'm off.

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:33.030
You sold this much in such a short time?

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:34.160
Yeah, sold a ton.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:55.880
Kid.

00:31:57.550 --> 00:31:59.660
Hop on. I'll take you for a ride.

00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:08.860
Who is that? Riding so fast.

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:10.830
Slow down!

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:46.150
Feeling good?

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:48.340
Scared?

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:12.880
Pretty awesome. It was really fast.

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:14.730
Kid,

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:19.930
I've always treated you like
a younger brother.

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:21.730
I think we're alike in some ways.

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:23.880
Life

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:27.460
is full of goodbyes
we don't get to choose.

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.480
Even if you want to hold on,

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:31.640
you may not be able to.

00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:33.460
When my dad passed away,

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:35.920
Dongdong was barely
old enough to remember.

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:38.290
I didn't even have time to grieve.

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:40.990
I had to help my mom support the family.

00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:43.170
I did all kinds of work back then,

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.030
as long as it paid.

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:55.270
I'm not...

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:02.510
I'm not exactly sad right now.

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:04.720
I just feel...

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:09.630
Feel like there's no hope.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.679
Look, you still have a younger brother.

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:16.000
With my grandma gone...

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:20.550
With my grandma gone, I...

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:23.150
I've got

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:26.010
nothing left here.

00:34:28.139 --> 00:34:29.980
My dad hasn't sent word in years.

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:32.760
He probably won't come back.

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:37.280
Kid.

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:42.210
Have you thought about
what you want to do in the future?

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:44.710
Just work and make some money.

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:48.400
You're a student.
What do you need money for?

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:51.710
What for...

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.040
I don't know for sure.

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:56.150
But having some money in my pocket

00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:57.550
makes me feel a bit more secure.

00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:58.400
Otherwise...

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:03.670
Secure, huh?

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:06.440
Fair enough.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.360
If you want to make money, go ask Zhigang.

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:13.630
He's got plenty of ideas.

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:16.990
What else other than money?

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:19.760
I haven't thought about it.

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:25.060
When I was a kid,
I always wanted to join the army.

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.810
Joining the army is great.

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.000
That's really cool.

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:32.300
This could work.

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:36.380
Practice boxing with me starting today.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.630
It'll come in handy.

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:41.600
This could work.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:42.500
Okay.

How tough can it be?

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:21.590

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:15.760
I've got nothing to do at home.

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.600
Da said you've got work here,

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:18.670
so I thought I'd come check it out

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:19.550
and make some money.

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:20.150
Come on up.

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:24.600
Doesn't your family run a newsstand?

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:27.760
Don't even get me started.

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.230
No one's bought anything for weeks.

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:30.830
No one reads papers anymore.

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:32.120
My goodness.

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:33.510
It's really

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:36.950
scorching here. What are you doing here?

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:38.280
Working, of course.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:39.800
What kind of work?

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:42.530
Want to work with me?

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:44.920
I'll show you the ropes.

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:45.470
Okay.

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:48.190
Zhigang.

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:51.900
Seriously, what are we waiting for
in this sun?

00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:54.110
You'll see.

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.940
What is it?
Why are you acting so mysterious?

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.120
Isn't that Director Hou?

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:12.920
Guys,

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:15.320
could you help push the car?

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:16.440
Director Hou!

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:18.510
What happened?

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:19.760
Zhigang!

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:21.210
Just in time.

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:23.060
I need a favor.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.370
Please lend me a hand
and give the car a push.

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:26.590
You need our help, right?

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:27.510
Yes, yes.

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:28.620
Sure thing.

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:30.560
Here comes work.

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:33.280
Come on, guys.

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:35.340
Let's go.

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:37.590
Director Hou!

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.670
Nice car.

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:41.360
Look at this car.

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:42.560
What's nice about it?

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:44.030
It belongs to the state—

00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:45.290
no good or bad about it.

00:38:46.070 --> 00:38:46.670
Zhigang.

00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:48.720
Do me a favor.

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:49.980
Ask your buddies

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:50.940
to help push it.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:57.820
You want money?

00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:59.480
Of course.

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:00.480
Look,

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:01.030
we're out here

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.630
in the wind and sun.

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:02.960
We deserve a little
hard-earned pay, right?

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:03.890
Don't you agree?

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.270
Hit the gas.
I don't believe we can't get out.

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:13.000
Sure, hit it.

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:14.470
Come on.

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:16.890
Floor it!

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:24.600
How can they possibly get out?

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:26.730
Right, sir. This way! This way. Right.

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:28.960
Turn the wheel right!

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.000
Alright, fine.

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:37.620
Zhigang, how about this?

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:39.850
Thirty yuan, alright?

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:42.510
This kind of cost isn't reimbursable,

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.650
so I have to pay out of my own pocket.

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:45.600
Director Hou,

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.960
if it were anyone else,

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.230
I'd charge 30.

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:52.450
But since it's you, Director Hou,

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:54.140
I'll have to charge 50.

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:03.070
Thank you, Director Hou.

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:04.840
Come on, guys. Let's get to work!

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:05.550
Hurry up.

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:07.980
Come on.

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:19.440
Bye-bye, Director Hou.

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:24.480
Xiaoman.

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:29.990
Zhigang.

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.000
Fifty to push a car?

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.530
Isn't that a bit expensive?

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:36.360
We're all working out in the sun and wind,

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:38.960
making some hard-earned money.

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:40.630
It's almost like you're barefoot,

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:42.960
yet you worry about sand in others' shoes.

00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:47.470
Come on, back to work.

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:48.840
Coming.

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:56.360
You guys, pour a few more
buckets of water in there!

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:57.070
Got it.

00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.960
Mix it evenly!

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.030
Zhigang.

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:09.210
If we keep digging holes like this,

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:11.310
isn't that basically a scam?

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:12.550
What scam?

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:13.730
I'm telling you,

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:15.190
these people with cars nowadays—

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:17.390
how many of them got their money fairly?

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:19.400
But

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.730
the cars on this road
are mostly from the factory.

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:24.920
So what if they're from the factory?

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:27.070
I'm precisely targeting the factory cars.

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:28.800
I didn't even get my quarterly bonus.

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.000
So shouldn't I level the playing field

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.460
with the factory leaders?

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:35.730
After my grandma passed away,

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.120
those in the factory
really took care of me.

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.320
They treated me well.

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.080
So how can I scam the factory?

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:44.030
Let me tell you,
your mindset is problematic.

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:45.110
Your way of thinking is wrong,

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:45.670
you know?

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:46.910
Do you think

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.360
making money nowadays is that easy?

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:51.800
You think you can still earn it
by following the rules?

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:52.320
The factory?

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.590
Look at what the factory has done to us.

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:54.360
And you're still trying to defend it?

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:55.360
I don't want to do this.

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:56.480
Look at the state you're in now.

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.070
You're still thinking about
not scamming them?

00:41:58.070 --> 00:41:59.870
Hasn't the factory scammed you?

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:03.610
We've got business.

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:05.410
-Come on.
-You go. I'm not going.

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:21.860
Mr. Yan.

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:23.520
What happened?

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:24.750
It's you guys.

00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:27.390
Your car's stuck here, isn't it?

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:28.480
Do you need help?

00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:29.060
Yes.

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:30.940
Since you're here, give it a push.

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:33.450
What do you mean?

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.030
Mr. Yan, you see,
you want us to help you out,

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:42.090
but we can't do it for nothing, right?

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:43.070
Fine.

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:44.670
I'll pay. It's okay.

00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:46.110
G-Go buy some bottles of soda, alright?

00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:48.000
We're Xiaodan's good friends.

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:49.530
We'll help you.

00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:50.100
Okay?

00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:52.130
Alright, alright. Thank you.

00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:53.000
Xiaoman!

00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:55.800
Xiaoman, come and help!

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:57.590
Xiaoman!

00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:59.080
Come and help!

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:01.670
Come on!
