(Adapted from the Qidian novel "Losing
Money to Be a Tycoon" by Qingshan Quzui)

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.480
Hello.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.040
Finally here.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.280
Why are airports located
so far away these days?

00:01:24.377 --> 00:01:25.590
I fell asleep on the way here.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.040
I'll sleep more on the plane.

00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:28.420
We've still got a long way to go.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.400
It's been a long time
since I traveled this far.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.120
Still, you're more
experienced than I am.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.950
Welcome aboard.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.310
Nice outfit you've got there.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.840
I bought it on my last trip.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.400
Wei, is that a new model?

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.480
Let me take a look.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.280
Mr. Pei.

00:01:43.822 --> 00:01:45.419
Hurry up.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.480
You've got the least luggage
and you're still slow.

00:01:47.488 --> 00:01:48.120
Mr. Pei.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.280
Hurry up, Mr. Pei.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.560
Yeah, hurry.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:07.220
(Stay true to our mission,
succeed for the greater good.)

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.240
(Recently,)

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.590
(Tengda Group invested heavily)

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.333
(to acquire a vineyard
in Burgundy, France,)

00:02:15.377 --> 00:02:17.000
(covering 1.3 hectares.)

00:02:17.022 --> 00:02:19.022
(The appellation
where the vineyard is located)

00:02:19.044 --> 00:02:22.240
(has produced numerous wines,
all awarded Grand Cru status.)

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.800
(This means)

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.240
(that beyond gaming, real estate,)

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.444
(food and beverage, film and television,
and logistics,)

00:02:26.466 --> 00:02:28.400
(Tengda is once again exploring
a new field.)

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.360
(Tengda's founder, Mr. Pei Qian,)

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.240
(independently developed
his first game many years ago)

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.280
(in the bedroom
of his shabby rental apartment.)

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.150
(It became a smash hit upon release,)

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.960
(leading Tengda to its first step
toward success.)

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:40.955
(In the eyes of others,)

00:02:40.977 --> 00:02:42.700
(Pei Qian achieved success
at a young age)

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.520
(and became a legend.)

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.680
Try this. It's good.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.560
Thanks.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.150
Qian.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.840
Tang told me. That magazine
contacted you over thirty times,

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.750
and you didn't go once.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.870
Skipping interviews is one thing,

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.030
but you should attend the forum.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.355
At least show them some courtesy.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.750
You...

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.590
Qian.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.840
Mr. Pei.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:08.680
Mr. Pei.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.750
(The man at the helm, Mr. Pei Qian,)

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:11.750
(is extremely low-key,)

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.150
(with unpredictable behavior,)

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.150
(making Tengda)

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.590
(a one-of-a-kind case
in local business history.)

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.840
(That's right.)

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.960
(I'm Pei Qian.)

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.870
(The founder of the Tengda Group
that everyone's talking about.)

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.520
(The eternal honorary chairman
in my employees' hearts.)

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.960
(Outsiders always praise me
for my early success.)

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.400
(But I feel)

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.590
(this is all just a dream.)

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.150
(And this dream)

(began eight years ago.)

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.280
(2022)

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:50.750
Pei Qian,

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.400
how many years have you been at Fuhui?

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.120
I...

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.340
I remember he joined
right after graduating from college.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.240
(Fuhui)
Time really flies.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:58.960
Pei Qian's

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.310
thinking is very active,

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.280
but sometimes it's too active.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.000
And that's not necessarily a good thing.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.650
Fuhui has been established
for many years.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.590
From time to time,

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.520
there will naturally be internal issues.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.470
That's perfectly normal.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.310
I've read what you wrote here.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.030
You're entitled to your own views,

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.480
but circulating them in writing

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.510
is far too serious.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:19.730
How about

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.240
taking a break at home?

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.830
Take some time to readjust.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.190
I understand.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.390
So in this situation,

00:04:33.933 --> 00:04:35.270
am I getting severance pay?

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.630
In this situation...

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.950
No compensation.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.190
Then can I get my things back?

Hey, just because you don't like it,
doesn't mean you can bully it.

Look at you, being all kind.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.950
You can barely feed yourself,

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.070

Come here, kitty!

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.870
You poor thing.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.120
How about I take you home?

(You poor thing.)

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.070
Are you sure this is the person
you're looking for?

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.240

But honestly, Fuhui these days

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.950
doesn't have anything new either.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.270
And are we at Jinghong any better?

Relax.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.790
Mr. Sima only wants to give you

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:05.910
a new job offer.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:08.270
Mr. Pei,

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:11.120
I hope you'll accept my investment

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.390
and start a company.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:18.120
What Mr. Sima means is,

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.000
this company must launch projects.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.150
We'll settle accounts based on
each project cycle.

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:24.066
If the project makes a profit
during the cycle,

00:09:24.066 --> 00:09:26.150
you'll only receive a base salary
of 5,000.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.630
But if the project loses money,
however much it loses,

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:31.030
that amount will be your bonus.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.390
So you're saying

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:39.270
you give me startup capital,

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:40.510
I set up a company,

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:42.510
and if it succeeds, I don't get paid,

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.510
but if it loses money,
you pay me instead?

You know what I ran into today?

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.440
Some old guy actually

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.150
rented a private jet,

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.000
with a beautiful secretary,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.840
saying he wanted to invest in my company

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.840
like some kind of angel investment.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:03.720

- Over here.

00:10:11.511 --> 00:10:12.790
Thanks for your cooperation.

Not at all.

the police, right?

What Ms. Xin and Mr. Sima said is true.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.840
As for this "angel investment" thing

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.320
they said they want to do with you,

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.600
we don't know the details either.

But that's fine.

As long as it's not illegal,

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.960
there's no problem.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.550
Alright. You can go.

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.320

He's a con artist.

Sorry about that just now.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:44.270
So how much are you planning to invest?

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.580
(Confidential Cooperation Agreement)

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.080
One...

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:58.030
Two...

00:11:58.270 --> 00:11:59.030
Three...

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.030
Four...

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.030
Five...

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.440
Six zeros.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.360
That much?

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:06.670
For a startup,

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.150
that number isn't much.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.750
No, Mr. Sima...

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:11.270
This is way too easy.

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:12.550
Startups are startups.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.870
Out of ten projects,
nine will lose money,

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:15.840
and one

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.750
will start losing before it even begins.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.960
This job is so good, I'd do it
even without a base salary.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.550
I suggest you take it.

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:26.720
Maybe someday you'll realize
the base salary matters.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.390
All the terms are in there.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.600
Mr. Pei, please read them carefully.

00:12:36.555 --> 00:12:38.466
(Confidential Agreement)
One gigabyte of terms...

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:40.870
Chapter 1, Article 1.

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.150
You may not, by any means,

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.440
disclose or hint at the contents
of this cooperation.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.390
Article 2.

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:47.270
Company formation...

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:50.270
Rich people really have
the weirdest hobbies.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:52.750
Is Sima just so rich
he's bored out of his mind?

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:57.600
Could there be some kind of trap?

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:02.360
The chairman of Jinghong Group

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.270
set up this huge scheme for you?

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.440
What does he want?

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.510
At this stage,

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:11.270
if HR does a background check
with Fuhui,

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:12.670
they won't say a single good thing.

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:14.044
I can't get into a big company,

00:13:14.044 --> 00:13:15.870
and small companies don't pay enough.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.240
Might as well take this
to get by for now.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:20.750
Then, when I job-hunt again,

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:23.080
I can add Jinghong to my resume.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.750
Honestly, these terms

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.750
are pretty reasonable.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.910
No large-scale real estate purchases
or property speculation.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:34.870
No buying cryptocurrency.

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:36.222
(Law Code)
No illegal activity.

00:13:36.266 --> 00:13:38.670
(Supply and Demand)
No disrupting markets.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:44.270
So basically, everything's banned.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:46.200
And it says they'll add more terms later

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.360
depending on the situation.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.390
And the final approval for every project

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:51.600
lies with Mr. Sima and Ms. Xin.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.670
That means we have zero autonomy.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.270
But did you notice?

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:57.150
There's no penalty
for breach of contract.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:59.270
So for us, there's no downside at all.

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:01.720
True.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.840
But anything that would lose money fast
is off-limits.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.480
We can't do charity donations,

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.360
and we can't invest in stocks.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.960
Then what can we do?

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:11.670
Pagers.

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:13.200
Who even knows what a pager is anymore?

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.200
Guaranteed losses.

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:16.600
The terms say

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.840
the industry we go into

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.750
must benefit market development,

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.600
and it has to be profitable.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.800
How am I supposed to tell them

00:14:22.866 --> 00:14:24.670
pagers can be profitable?

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.360
Then do art.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.440
Price our self-portraits at one million.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.733
Who's going to buy that?

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:33.390
The terms say

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:34.150
the company may not

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:35.910
pay far above market value

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:37.750
to purchase production materials,

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.510
rent venues, hire staff, and so on.

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:40.720
Bike-sharing?

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.390
Not allowed.

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:42.630
A farm?

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:43.360
Not allowed.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.260
(Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:14:44.266 --> 00:14:44.909
Not allowed.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:45.644
A car dealership?

00:14:45.666 --> 00:14:46.840
Not allowed.

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:49.150
Let's start with games.

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:50.480
This is what I do.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.270
I know what kind of games
can lose money.

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:53.960
If we lose money in other businesses,

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.910
we'd have to sell off fixed assets.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:56.750
But games?

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:59.270
It's just a bunch of code
that's worth nothing.

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:00.480
A total loss.

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:03.200
Pull this one job, take the loss,
and walk away.

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:06.080
(Pay Slip)
Worst case, I get a 5,000 base salary.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.870
If I win the bet, I'm set for life.

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:16.580
(Confidential Agreement)

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:17.720
I've decided.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.240
I'm making a game.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:24.960
Since you've decided
to start with games,

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.240
then I wish you success

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.390
in losing your way to the top.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.960
Then, Mr. Pei,

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.790
please sign and leave your fingerprint.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.630
Mr. Sima has assigned me
to be involved throughout.

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:41.150
From now on, I'll be transferred

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:43.480

Everything you do,

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.200
I will report to Mr. Sima in real time.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.390
about your new company's name.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:42.880
Talk to me.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.440
I quit Fuhui.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.350
Fuhui's such a great company.

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:49.440
You just quit like that?

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.270
Why?

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.000
I actually got pulled into a plan.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.310
They want me to run a company.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:56.110
You?

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:57.830
Running a company?

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.000
I'm really starting a company.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.070
This thing is actually...

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.030
Actually, I...

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:09.070
Actually, you

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.200
are a rich kid!

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.440
Qian.

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:18.110
We've known each other for years.

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:19.590
If you really trust me,

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:20.830
then tell me the truth.

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:22.110
Are you a rich kid or not?

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:24.550
- I could tell back then.
- I...

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.550
When we were kids,

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:28.060
you were always the one buying me food.

00:19:28.133 --> 00:19:29.590
When people borrowed money from you,

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:31.110
you never made a big deal out of it.

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:32.440
And at work, even more so.

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:35.310
You dared to speak your mind
to the boss.

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:36.510
Everyone says

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:39.720
Pei Qian is just sticking to his guns.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.270
But only I

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:43.200
figured out your secret.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.920
You're actually a rich kid.

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:47.200
So you're done pretending,
and you're coming clean!

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:49.310
I've been waiting for this day.

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:51.160
And you kept it from me all this time.

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:54.310
But it's fine.

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:57.110
Now that you've picked me,

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.350
we're like Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang,

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:02.270
like Sherlock Holmes and Watson!

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.030
Watson...

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.030
Classic you.

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:13.920
Anyway,

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:15.750
just don't tell anyone else.

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.030
I've got startup funding.

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:18.590
Startup funding?

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:20.510
Do you even have ten grand?

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:28.160
Pei Qian.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.830
I may look dumb,

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.350
but I'm not actually stupid.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.310
If you're starting a company,

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:34.550
what am I supposed to be?

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:35.790
BA.

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:37.790
BA? Like security guard?

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:40.400
You think I've been living under a rock?

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:41.440
Fine.

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:42.590
General manager.

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:43.790
I want to be the chairman.

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:44.790
General manager.

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:45.830
Vice chairman.

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:47.270
General manager.

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:49.400
Vice chairman, final offer!

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:10.580
(Unity, Efficiency, Win-Win)

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:12.830
Qian, we're working here?

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:15.750
The decor's kind of old-school,

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.440
but it's fine. I can live with it.

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:22.030
Is this our office?

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.160
How do we split it?

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.044
You take the bigger side
and put up a divider.

00:21:25.066 --> 00:21:26.750
It's a little too open, isn't it?

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.160
This is Mr. Pei.

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:29.440
Hello, Mr. Pei.

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:29.830
Mr. Ma.

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:30.888
I'm Cui from the agency.

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:32.440
Just call me Cui.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.350
High-floor units in
the Shenhua International office tower

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:36.590
rarely become available.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:38.070
Take a look.

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:43.109
The environment is great,
the floor is great,

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:44.270
and the view is great too.

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:45.680
There's only one downside.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:46.920
The rent

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.270
is a little on the high side.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.000
As you can see,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.400
the previous tenant's layout

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.440
wasn't optimal,

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.110
so it only seats fifty-something people.

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:57.400
But with a little adjustment,

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.000
it can seat at least seventy.

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:02.350
I think this is great.

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:06.590
You two are in luck.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:08.830
The last tenant was in debt,
and the boss ran off.

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:09.790
The landlord said

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:12.160
all the office furniture you see here

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.510
can be used for free.

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:14.110
That's great.

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:15.200
Throw it all out.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:19.590
This place looks fine.

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:21.160
Why hasn't it been rented out?

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.790
Actually, it rents easily.

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:25.030
It's just that the last few tenants

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:26.533
all went under due to poor management.

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:28.200
They all went under?

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.070
We'll take it.

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:41.640
If you're really interested,

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:42.750
I can give you a discount

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:43.640
on my fee.

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:44.790
No discount.

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:47.680
You deserve it.

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:55.830
Then I'll go prepare the contract.

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:02.270
Ms. Xin,

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:04.070
the contract only says

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:06.350
we can't rent an office
above market price.

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:08.550
If I don't ask for a discount
or negotiate,

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:09.790
that's not a violation, right?

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.750
Technically, no.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.110
But that only lets you burn
a small amount of money.

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:19.110
We're a game company.

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:21.110
Employees are prone
to occupational injuries.

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:22.240
So all our facilities

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.310
need upgrades.

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:24.030
Look,

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:26.350
we need to use
the most expensive chairs.

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:28.030
For everyone?

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:28.750
Of course,

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:30.440
there's no hierarchy at Tengda,

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:33.550
so the chairs should be the same.

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:34.590
And also,

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:35.510
look at these desks.

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.680
We should switch them all
to automatic sit-stand ones.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.550
And since we're a game company,

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:41.200
every computer should come with

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.200
an RTX 4090 graphics card.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.750
The CPU must be an i9,

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:45.440
and throw in

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.790
two 128GB RAM sticks.

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:51.110
Swap all drives to SSDs.

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:53.920
And fill these empty spots with plants.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:57.270
Like dracaena, alocasia...

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:59.790
Whatever's the most delicate,
that's what we get.

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:02.000
For guests, we'll serve...

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:06.270
Premium Lao Ban Zhang tea.

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:11.000
Alright. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.030
I'll assign someone
to handle procurement.

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:16.200
Qian,

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:18.350
is she from your previous company?

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:20.350
No. Her name is Xin Hailu.

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:22.350
She's the special assistant.

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:24.070
From now on, you two are coworkers.

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:26.790
A big office

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:28.550
and a nice assistant.

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:29.680
What a dream start.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.110
But I'll admit, I'm the weak spot
in this setup.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:34.270
I don't have much experience.

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:36.310
I don't even know if I can help you.

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:37.590
Helping your grandpa

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:40.350
run a fruit stall.

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:42.200
In a way,

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.440
isn't that basically

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.960
operating a family-owned business?

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.000
Who says you don't have experience?

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.288
You're an indispensable partner

00:24:49.288 --> 00:24:50.790
on my entrepreneurial journey.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.350
Together, we're unstoppable.

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:57.070
Let's get Tengda off the ground
as soon as possible.

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:03.110
Mr. Pei, you want to pay Ma Yang

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:05.070
a 50,000 monthly salary?

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:07.110
What's the problem?

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:09.400
After graduating,

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.790
he hasn't had a single

00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:11.830
proper job.

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:14.270
In school, he failed every subject
and had to retake them.

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:15.680
And under "Certificates,"

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.590
(Certificates)
he didn't even list CET-4.

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:21.790
That's because he didn't want
to show off.

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:24.830
So he never passed CET-4.

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:28.350
He wanted to go straight for CET-6,

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:29.640
so he didn't take CET-4.

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:35.110
Keep it low-key.

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:50.110
Anyway, I have my reasons
for hiring him.

00:25:50.333 --> 00:25:51.550
And according to the contract,

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:53.350
I have hiring authority.

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:00.750
That was my oversight.

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:03.350
But everyone has a cap.

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.070
For Mr. Ma,

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:07.350
the most you can pay him
is 5,000 a month.

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:09.550
5,000? That's the same as me!

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:11.550
Why does he get to be on my level?

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:12.550
At least 20,000!

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:13.750
8,000.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:15.830
10,000.

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:16.590
Deal.

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.110
Ma Yang,

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:30.720
why'd you buy so many books?

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.270
For our future.

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:33.730
Qian,

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:34.440
I never thought

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.960
I'd ever make 10,000 a month.

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:55.000
Why are you so good to me?

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:08.550

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.590
This game's ancient. You still play it?

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.200
I'm sentimental.

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:02.680

they say lucky cats attract wealth.

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.000
So why'd you get a black one?

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.960
It's name is Yintang.
It is our company cat

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.533
and Tengda's Chief Motivation Officer.

00:30:48.533 --> 00:30:50.350
I found it by the roadside when I quit

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:51.400
my last job.

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.480
After I found it,

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.030
I founded Tengda.

00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:55.720
So it's clearly a good omen.

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.440
Be nice to it, everyone.

There are only four of us.

What do you mean by "everyone"?

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:04.640
In the future,

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:07.270
we'll definitely be hiring more, right?

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.720
Qian, why isn't this room done?

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:23.830
Is it a storage room?

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:30.350
This room is my office.

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:40.000
The renovation budget went over,

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.440
so my room was...

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:43.030
But don't worry.

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:44.680
As the boss, I think

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:46.960
the best stuff should go
to the employees.

00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:49.070
These office supplies

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:50.480
were left by the previous tenant.

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.977
They were going to throw them out,

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.310
but I called to have
the agent bring them back.

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.400
Such an amazing boss.

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.480
Our workspace looks amazing,

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.350

with your office setup?

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:10.790

Mr. Pei, this is the first time
I've heard of

00:33:21.466 --> 00:33:23.110
cutting a yellow ribbon for an opening.

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:24.270
Isn't that bad luck?

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:27.160
That's right, yellow means "go bust."

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:33.400
I meant cutting off the projects
that "go bust."

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.920
Then naturally we'll soar to prosperity.

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.070

how trashy this game can get.

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.630
Isn't it running already?

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.480
You just hold down the direction key.

- Insane...

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:20.800
(Loading next level)

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.000
There's a second level?

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.320
This game is so boring.

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:33.480
There's nothing new at all.

00:36:33.622 --> 00:36:35.480
It's just driving straight
and sightseeing,

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.360
and the scenery is all pixelated.

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.150
Turn...

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:47.030
Brake...

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.590
Brake!

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:50.030
Why are there no brakes?

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:54.030
No...

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:55.550
(Game Over)

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:01.550
Okay, there's something here.

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:11.670
Time to turn.

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:12.760
I know.

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:18.550
Nice.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.000
Can't trick me a second time.

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:33.030
Turn this way!

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:40.550
(Game Over)

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:46.030
What is this?

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.670
This game doesn't follow rules at all.

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.030
It's totally unhinged.

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.150
Again!

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:02.980
(Series of turns)

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.800
(Game Over)

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:13.060
(Series of turns)

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:19.590
(Game Over)

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:20.760
Focus.

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:22.880
Left-left-left.

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:24.550
Right-right-left.

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.320
Left-left-right.

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:27.760
Right-right-left.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.760
Left-right-left. Right-left-right.

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:31.030
Right-right-left.

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:32.590
Left-right-left. Right-left-right.

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:34.550
Left-left-right-right. Left-right-left.

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:45.670
We made it.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.800
(Game Over)

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:13.590
Again.

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:19.880
Ready?

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:20.760
Ready.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.360
I'm ready to go to war with this game.

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:26.710
No way I can't beat it.

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.880
Left. Left.

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.710
Right.

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:33.480
Left.

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:35.110
Right.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:36.630
Left.

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:38.230
No, right!

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:43.230
Left. Right.

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:44.230
Left.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:45.400
Right.

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:56.070
Right-right-left.
Left-right-left-right. Right.

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:57.590
Left-left-left.

00:39:58.110 --> 00:39:59.360
Left-right. Right.

00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:00.280
Right. Left.

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:01.230
Left.

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:02.880
Left-left-right-right.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:03.360
Left.

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:09.620
(Level Cleared)

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.030
(Congratulations, you've wasted)

00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:13.880
(eight precious hours of your life.)

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:30.400
What kind of company made this game?

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:31.460
(Congratulations!)

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:38.260
