Is that my baby?

No, it's my baby.

00:00:58.205 --> 00:01:00.172
I suppose the question was unclear.

00:01:00.172 --> 00:01:01.338
I'll ask again.

00:01:01.338 --> 00:01:03.238
Am I your baby's father?

Well... I don't know why you think that.

But it's not your baby.

Given all the circumstances,
I'm certain I'm your baby's father.

Even taking responsibility
has different scenarios.

00:08:18.605 --> 00:08:22.905
Option 1. Don't get married,
and just pay child support.

00:08:27.338 --> 00:08:29.338
- What is this?
- 10 billion won.

00:08:29.338 --> 00:08:31.005
- 10 billion?
- It's child support.

00:08:31.005 --> 00:08:33.805
If needed, I'll add 10 million won monthly.

00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:37.538
Don't ask to see the kid later
or say anything else.

00:08:45.872 --> 00:08:48.972
This ending feels a bit bitter.

00:08:48.972 --> 00:08:53.538
Option 2. I raise the baby,
and she pays me compensation.

00:08:54.738 --> 00:08:58.372
Can I hold the baby for a moment?

00:09:11.638 --> 00:09:13.572
Who do you think I am?
Selling babies for profit?

00:09:13.572 --> 00:09:14.605
Forget it!

This is even worse.

00:09:22.572 --> 00:09:26.172
Option 3. Get married
and raise the child together.

00:09:30.438 --> 00:09:32.205
Why aren't they coming out?

00:09:37.005 --> 00:09:39.105

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:55.205
Sir.

00:11:55.205 --> 00:11:59.605
I mean, it's just that...

00:12:00.338 --> 00:12:04.165
You can't do this to me.

00:12:04.165 --> 00:12:05.957
Jeez.

00:12:06.805 --> 00:12:08.738
Looks like you had a tough day.

00:12:08.738 --> 00:12:11.605
This is the cognac I really treasure.

00:12:11.605 --> 00:12:14.772
Drink this and shake it off.

00:12:21.505 --> 00:12:26.005
Sir, just pretend you're doing this for me.

00:12:26.005 --> 00:12:27.805
Instead, can you

00:12:27.805 --> 00:12:29.138
drink and wow once?

00:12:29.138 --> 00:12:30.872
Me?

00:12:33.672 --> 00:12:35.472
Want me to do it?

00:12:45.872 --> 00:12:48.138
Being a mom isn't easy, is it?

00:12:48.138 --> 00:12:49.605
How did you know?

00:12:49.605 --> 00:12:52.338
If you can't drink your favorite alcohol,
it's one of two things.

00:12:52.338 --> 00:12:55.538
Either you're terminally ill,
or you're pregnant.

00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:11.738
I had a child at twenty-two.

00:13:11.738 --> 00:13:16.705
Back then, I was overwhelmed,
so I kept the baby without knowing better.

00:13:16.705 --> 00:13:20.205
But when I think of everything
I gave up afterward,

00:13:20.205 --> 00:13:24.272
- well...
- Did you regret it?

00:13:24.272 --> 00:13:26.938
Well, I guess it depends on the person.

00:13:26.938 --> 00:13:30.572
But if you're not prepared,
it can be really hard.

00:13:30.572 --> 00:13:34.805
Even if the baby is adorable,
the child and my life are on separate paths.

00:13:36.238 --> 00:13:38.238
It's complicated.

00:13:39.472 --> 00:13:43.372
You seem troubled.
What does the baby's father say?

00:13:43.372 --> 00:13:45.072
Well...

00:13:46.005 --> 00:13:48.972
Sometimes, talking to
a stranger isn't so bad.

00:13:48.972 --> 00:13:51.572
You can open up about things.

00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:02.838
This baby wasn't planned.

00:14:02.838 --> 00:14:04.872
At the most crucial moment,

00:14:04.872 --> 00:14:09.505
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
has arrived alongside this new life.

00:14:10.772 --> 00:14:16.038
It's something I caused,
and I know I have to take responsibility,

00:14:17.072 --> 00:14:19.438
but I feel completely lost.

00:14:19.438 --> 00:14:21.538
You don't need to feel guilty.

00:14:21.538 --> 00:14:26.472
Would a child born out of regret
and unpreparedness really be happy?

00:14:28.005 --> 00:14:31.072
If I were you, Hui Won,

00:14:31.072 --> 00:14:32.938
I'd chase the opportunity.

Yes.

You drink it.

If you keep giving everything away

with your wife too, right?

You announced you'd marry

Our parents have such
high expectations of you.

00:23:33.772 --> 00:23:37.138
Thinking about it, morally
and cost-effectively...

00:23:37.138 --> 00:23:38.605
It's better to get it over with quickly.

00:23:38.605 --> 00:23:40.805
What nonsense is this? Explain it properly.

00:23:40.805 --> 00:23:42.638
Did the chairman say he won't hand over
the company if you don't marry?

00:23:42.638 --> 00:23:45.372
Or did your ideal woman suddenly appear?

00:23:45.372 --> 00:23:47.938
What on earth are you thinking?

00:23:47.938 --> 00:23:50.272
You won't marry because of me, right?

00:23:50.272 --> 00:23:52.172
- Se Hyeon.
- You keep avoiding blind dates,

00:23:52.172 --> 00:23:54.772
and refusing to get married.

00:23:54.772 --> 00:23:58.005
I feel it's all because of me, and it hurts.

00:23:58.005 --> 00:23:59.538
What is this even supposed to mean?

00:23:59.538 --> 00:24:01.005
You... ah!

00:24:01.005 --> 00:24:04.272
Is this some kind of strategic marriage
between companies?

00:24:04.272 --> 00:24:05.573
Oh, I don't know.

00:24:05.573 --> 00:24:06.638
Wait.

00:24:06.638 --> 00:24:07.972
That might actually be better.

00:24:07.972 --> 00:24:09.738
- Huh?
- Everyone around us

00:24:09.738 --> 00:24:11.705
is in arranged marriages for show.

00:24:11.705 --> 00:24:14.472
For us, marriage is just
another business move.

00:24:14.472 --> 00:24:16.305
So why not go through with it?

00:24:16.305 --> 00:24:20.705
Who knows? Maybe marriage
will fix my current instability.

00:24:20.705 --> 00:24:22.938
You're seriously sick.
Let's go to the hospital.

00:24:22.938 --> 00:24:24.538
Anyway, that's what you should know.

00:24:24.538 --> 00:24:26.305
What, are you getting married by yourself?

00:24:26.305 --> 00:24:27.505
Do you even have a bride?

00:24:27.505 --> 00:24:29.172
I'm on my way to meet her now.

00:24:29.172 --> 00:24:30.938
That bride you're so curious about...

00:24:30.938 --> 00:24:32.638
Bride?

00:24:35.138 --> 00:24:37.272
Are we going to church now or something?

00:24:42.405 --> 00:24:44.438
No responsibility.

00:24:44.438 --> 00:24:46.305
Guilty conscience.

00:24:46.305 --> 00:24:47.472
A free life.

00:24:47.472 --> 00:24:52.238
As you know, when our new president
arrives, he'll tour every floor.

00:24:52.238 --> 00:24:54.338
Everyone, please keep things tidy.

00:24:54.338 --> 00:24:56.072
- Environmental cleanup...
- Is she in shock from happiness?

00:24:56.072 --> 00:24:57.772
She's been waiting for this moment.

00:24:57.772 --> 00:24:59.038
Maybe the tension finally melted away.

00:24:59.038 --> 00:25:00.038
- Right?
- And one more thing.

00:25:00.038 --> 00:25:01.038
Our team's business proposal...

00:25:01.038 --> 00:25:03.138
Studying in Germany.

00:25:03.138 --> 00:25:04.272
My dream coming true.

00:25:04.272 --> 00:25:05.701
Manager Nah, take charge of this
and organize it once.

00:25:05.701 --> 00:25:07.205
Assistant Manager Choi, support him.

00:25:07.205 --> 00:25:10.638
- Yes.
- And for the remaining staff,

00:25:10.638 --> 00:25:12.272
- I was so close.
- you have the performance plan, right?

00:25:12.272 --> 00:25:14.905
Organize that and report it to me.

00:25:14.905 --> 00:25:16.472
Tak Soo, compile it and report to me.

00:25:16.472 --> 00:25:17.805
Understood.

00:25:17.805 --> 00:25:18.838
And...

00:25:18.838 --> 00:25:20.372
Taking responsibility.

00:25:20.372 --> 00:25:23.738
- Single mom, lack of money.
- About the new product proposal.

00:25:23.738 --> 00:25:25.005
It was seriously lacking. Check...

00:25:25.005 --> 00:25:26.938
Workaholic.

00:25:29.305 --> 00:25:31.672
A lonely child.

00:25:31.672 --> 00:25:33.772
A bad mother.

00:25:33.772 --> 00:25:35.872
Understood.

00:25:35.872 --> 00:25:38.138
A bad mother.

00:25:39.972 --> 00:25:43.505
- Looks like the meeting prep is mostly done.
- Alright.

00:25:43.505 --> 00:25:46.338
He might start next week,

00:25:46.338 --> 00:25:48.005
so don't let your schedules get disrupted.

00:25:48.005 --> 00:25:53.105
And with Manager Jang leaving
for Germany, there's a lot to wrap up.

00:25:53.105 --> 00:25:55.238
[Regular deposit]

00:25:55.238 --> 00:25:57.705
This won't even come close to enough.

00:26:03.538 --> 00:26:05.238
Manager Jang.

00:26:06.372 --> 00:26:08.138
Manager Jang.

00:26:09.538 --> 00:26:11.238
Manager Jang!

00:26:13.972 --> 00:26:16.005
Are you even listening?

00:26:16.005 --> 00:26:17.705
I'm sorry.

00:26:30.605 --> 00:26:32.638
Oh, I can't drink this.

00:26:34.672 --> 00:26:35.872
Switch with me.

00:26:35.872 --> 00:26:38.238
This is warm milk.

00:26:44.338 --> 00:26:46.938
Are you my aunt now?

00:26:48.325 --> 00:26:49.638
Oh.

00:26:49.638 --> 00:26:52.805
I'll keep it a secret at work. Don't worry.

00:26:53.438 --> 00:26:55.305
- Um...
- My uncle

00:26:55.305 --> 00:26:57.338
is not very skilled at things
outside of work.

00:26:57.338 --> 00:26:59.301
Especially, when it comes to dating
and relationships.

00:26:59.301 --> 00:27:01.189
He's kind of under-socialized.

00:27:01.972 --> 00:27:04.038
Anyway, all that is just

00:27:04.038 --> 00:27:07.605
because of his compulsion
to be perfect at everything.

00:27:07.605 --> 00:27:10.272
Please look upon him favorably.

00:27:10.272 --> 00:27:12.705
He says he won't get married,

00:27:12.705 --> 00:27:15.905
and he acts overly conservative
about marriage,

00:27:15.905 --> 00:27:18.705
but we all know that's not
how he really feels.

00:27:18.705 --> 00:27:21.538
It's all because of me.

00:27:24.261 --> 00:27:25.705
Ah.

00:27:25.705 --> 00:27:27.938
So you don't know yet.

00:27:27.938 --> 00:27:31.172
Anyway, you'll find out gradually.

00:27:39.405 --> 00:27:41.338
He says he won't get married,

00:27:41.338 --> 00:27:44.138
and he acts overly conservative
about marriage,

00:27:44.138 --> 00:27:46.572
but we all know that's not
how he really feels.

00:27:46.572 --> 00:27:49.138
It's all because of me.

00:27:49.138 --> 00:27:51.472
What's that supposed to mean?

00:27:59.538 --> 00:28:01.738
Why is he here?

00:28:01.738 --> 00:28:04.405
And I told you,

00:28:04.405 --> 00:28:05.872
things like who the CEO is aren't important.

00:28:05.872 --> 00:28:09.372
But it's not that he's currently
managing operations,

00:28:09.372 --> 00:28:10.372
it's about maintaining relationships.

00:28:10.372 --> 00:28:12.638
We need to maintain those connections.

00:28:12.638 --> 00:28:14.705
So first impressions

00:28:14.705 --> 00:28:16.505
- are extremely important.
- Oh, no.

00:28:16.505 --> 00:28:17.938
So in short,

00:28:17.938 --> 00:28:19.838
for example, when passing
by employees like this,

00:28:19.838 --> 00:28:21.872
you should smile and say hello,

00:28:21.872 --> 00:28:23.397
but you don't smile...

00:28:23.397 --> 00:28:24.805
Where did he go?

00:28:27.372 --> 00:28:29.072
Du Jun!

00:28:30.938 --> 00:28:32.672
Wait, why...

00:28:34.105 --> 00:28:36.005
Are you okay?

00:28:36.005 --> 00:28:37.572
Why on earth are you here?

00:28:37.572 --> 00:28:40.305
Did you investigate my background?

00:28:40.305 --> 00:28:42.638
Did you forget we agreed
to reach a conclusion soon?

00:28:42.638 --> 00:28:45.538
So what exactly is that conclusion?

00:28:48.438 --> 00:28:50.705
I've decided.

00:28:50.705 --> 00:28:52.405
I'll marry you.

00:28:52.405 --> 00:28:53.672
What?

00:28:53.672 --> 00:28:56.405
Are you going to keep the baby?

00:28:59.838 --> 00:29:01.738
Whether you give birth or not is your choice,

00:29:01.738 --> 00:29:05.572
but regardless of that, I also
have responsibilities for my child.

00:29:05.572 --> 00:29:08.272
So if you're going to keep it, let's hurry.

00:29:08.272 --> 00:29:12.205
I'd prefer the wedding be held this year.

00:29:12.205 --> 00:29:13.538
Hey.

00:29:13.538 --> 00:29:15.738
It's not hey. I'm Kang Du Jun.

00:29:15.738 --> 00:29:17.438
Fine, Mr. Kang Du Jun.

00:29:17.438 --> 00:29:20.938
Looks like you've been
getting way ahead of yourself,

00:29:20.938 --> 00:29:23.805
but I've never once considered marrying you.

00:29:23.805 --> 00:29:26.505
My own issues are complicated enough,

00:29:26.505 --> 00:29:28.572
so let's just go our separate ways.

00:29:28.572 --> 00:29:30.272
Let's pretend

00:29:31.205 --> 00:29:33.338
this never happened.

00:29:34.338 --> 00:29:37.505
You can't just erase something
that already happened.

00:29:37.505 --> 00:29:38.538
What I'm saying is...

00:29:38.538 --> 00:29:39.872
What's so special about marriage anyway?

00:29:39.872 --> 00:29:42.438
Marriage is business too.

00:29:42.438 --> 00:29:45.138
If you really want,
let's write up a contract.

00:29:45.138 --> 00:29:48.905
Of course, with the child's care
as the top priority.

00:29:49.738 --> 00:29:50.972
What did you say?

00:29:50.972 --> 00:29:54.705
Then I definitely can't agree
to a marriage like that.

00:29:54.705 --> 00:29:56.338
Why not?

00:29:56.338 --> 00:29:58.172
I've already made
future plans for the child...

00:29:58.172 --> 00:29:59.705
You booked that place?

00:29:59.705 --> 00:30:01.538
Yes, I pulled some strings.

00:30:01.538 --> 00:30:03.272
Shh.

00:30:35.238 --> 00:30:36.238
What?

00:30:36.238 --> 00:30:37.772
Team leader, this place is locked.

00:30:37.772 --> 00:30:39.672
But you said you booked it for this time.

00:30:39.672 --> 00:30:41.972
President.

00:30:41.972 --> 00:30:45.805
But we were together. Where did he go?

00:30:49.605 --> 00:30:52.272
Is someone inside?

00:30:52.272 --> 00:30:55.005
Oh no, what do we do?

00:30:55.005 --> 00:30:57.505
It seems locked from the inside.

00:31:03.072 --> 00:31:04.672
Then to the manager's office...

00:31:04.672 --> 00:31:07.772
What do you mean? We just go out and explain.

00:31:07.772 --> 00:31:08.772
No way.

00:31:08.772 --> 00:31:12.072
This is the perfect situation
for misunderstandings.

00:31:13.338 --> 00:31:15.038
I'll try forcing it open.

00:31:15.038 --> 00:31:16.972
What? You're going to force the door open?

00:31:16.972 --> 00:31:18.405
Call quickly.

00:31:18.405 --> 00:31:20.838
Then try calling me first.

00:31:26.305 --> 00:31:28.261
But I don't know your number.

00:31:28.261 --> 00:31:29.872
Alright.

00:31:29.872 --> 00:31:31.272
I knew it.

00:31:31.272 --> 00:31:32.738
Haven't you even saved my number?

00:31:32.738 --> 00:31:35.333
That's not important right now.

00:31:36.105 --> 00:31:38.205
You don't even read texts
from unknown numbers?

00:31:38.205 --> 00:31:40.272
Should I at least be grateful
you didn't block me?

00:31:40.272 --> 00:31:42.638
Okay, okay. I'm sorry about that.

00:31:42.638 --> 00:31:43.972
We'll really get caught like this.

00:31:43.972 --> 00:31:45.638
Do something.

00:31:45.638 --> 00:31:47.605
Ah, please.

00:31:47.605 --> 00:31:49.305
Three!

00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:52.738
Ah.

00:31:52.738 --> 00:31:53.905
- Ouch, my nose!
- What the...

00:31:53.905 --> 00:31:55.813
What's going on?

00:31:55.813 --> 00:31:58.638
President?

00:32:00.261 --> 00:32:01.829
Ouch.

00:32:04.325 --> 00:32:06.072
Ouch.

00:32:06.072 --> 00:32:07.538
Oh, President, I'm so sorry.

00:32:07.538 --> 00:32:08.972
I didn't know you were inside.

00:32:08.972 --> 00:32:11.805
- President?
- Manager Jang, are you even listening?

00:32:11.805 --> 00:32:13.438
I'm sorry.

00:32:13.438 --> 00:32:16.838
As you know, when our new president
arrives, he'll tour every floor.

00:32:16.838 --> 00:32:18.838
Everyone, please keep things tidy.

00:32:18.838 --> 00:32:23.472
He might start next week,
so don't let your schedules get disrupted.

00:32:23.472 --> 00:32:25.838
Then that president...

00:32:25.838 --> 00:32:27.605
I'm Kang Du Jun.

00:32:27.605 --> 00:32:31.272
But why are you here?

00:32:31.272 --> 00:32:32.638
And why are you here, Manager Jang?

00:32:32.638 --> 00:32:34.172
Well, I mean...

00:32:34.172 --> 00:32:37.572
I came for a preliminary visit. But I left
my phone in the car, so I borrowed hers.

00:32:37.572 --> 00:32:38.638
Is that a problem?

00:32:38.638 --> 00:32:40.272
No, of course not.

00:32:40.272 --> 00:32:42.805
If you need to finish your call,
we'll go somewhere else...

00:32:42.805 --> 00:32:44.738
President!

00:32:49.638 --> 00:32:51.405
Then I'll take my leave.

00:32:51.405 --> 00:32:53.105
Ah, right.

00:32:58.272 --> 00:33:02.205
Your phone works perfectly fine,
so there's no excuse for not replying.

00:33:04.905 --> 00:33:07.205
Oh, and,

00:33:07.205 --> 00:33:09.838
answer calls from unknown numbers too.

00:33:10.672 --> 00:33:11.772
Let's go, Secretary Go.

00:33:11.772 --> 00:33:13.505
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:33:24.172 --> 00:33:25.372
- Well...
- Secretary Go.

00:33:25.372 --> 00:33:27.005
Yes.

00:33:27.005 --> 00:33:28.772
Then, I'll get going.

00:33:37.972 --> 00:33:40.572
Wow.

00:33:40.572 --> 00:33:42.438
So that's why you were
desperately looking for her?

00:33:42.438 --> 00:33:43.905
And she's from the same company?

00:33:43.905 --> 00:33:45.405
Did you know?

00:33:45.405 --> 00:33:47.705
She's got a baby on the way,
and she wants to pretend it never happened?

00:33:47.705 --> 00:33:49.765
That's ridiculous.

00:33:49.765 --> 00:33:52.338
A baby? You're going to be a dad?

00:33:52.338 --> 00:33:53.438
It's not confirmed yet.

00:33:53.438 --> 00:33:54.738
What do you mean?

00:33:54.738 --> 00:33:56.038
Seriously, tell me.

00:33:56.038 --> 00:33:58.505
It's not really my decision to make.

00:33:58.505 --> 00:34:00.638
I've already prepared myself mentally.

00:34:00.638 --> 00:34:03.172
What? Explain it properly.

00:34:03.172 --> 00:34:05.305
I've been feeling kind of betrayed lately.

00:34:05.305 --> 00:34:07.305
Ugh, seriously.

00:34:10.905 --> 00:34:12.638
I misheard earlier, right?

00:34:12.638 --> 00:34:15.138
Marriage and a baby and all that?

00:34:15.138 --> 00:34:18.405
It's not certain yet, but you heard right.

00:34:19.903 --> 00:34:22.538
When... when did all this even happen?

00:34:22.538 --> 00:34:23.638
Marriage. A child.

00:34:23.638 --> 00:34:25.205
How come it happened so fast?

00:34:25.205 --> 00:34:29.138
And why didn't you tell me
about such happy news, huh?

00:34:29.138 --> 00:34:30.672
I'm really hurt by this.

00:34:30.672 --> 00:34:34.972
I'm not even sure you can call it good news.

00:34:34.972 --> 00:34:38.838
What is it? What are you so worried about?

00:34:38.838 --> 00:34:40.038
Why would I worry?

00:34:40.038 --> 00:34:42.572
We've known each other for years.

00:34:42.572 --> 00:34:46.172
That's the face you make
when you're really worried.

00:34:46.838 --> 00:34:51.105
Think of me as your bamboo forest
and say it all.

00:34:55.838 --> 00:34:57.765
I just know

00:34:57.765 --> 00:35:00.838
it's not my decision to make.

00:35:00.838 --> 00:35:03.205
If I were to become a real father,

00:35:03.205 --> 00:35:05.605
if I were to have a baby,

00:35:05.605 --> 00:35:08.605
I wonder if I could really
take proper responsibility.

00:35:08.605 --> 00:35:11.138
You were right.

00:35:11.138 --> 00:35:12.872
I guess I'm worried.

00:35:12.872 --> 00:35:15.105
Do you remember?

00:35:15.105 --> 00:35:19.905
My sister had nowhere to leave the kids.
She endured the pain until she collapsed.

00:35:19.905 --> 00:35:21.838
You offered to take care of them.

00:35:21.838 --> 00:35:25.872
Told her not to worry and go to the hospital.
It was chaos, remember?

00:35:25.872 --> 00:35:29.305
When she got back from the hospital,
the house was a complete mess.

00:35:29.305 --> 00:35:31.972
Both my nephews were hanging
off your broad back,

00:35:31.972 --> 00:35:34.072
and they refused to come down.

00:35:34.072 --> 00:35:36.638
I remember it was different
from raising Se Hyeon.

00:35:36.638 --> 00:35:39.172
Maybe because they were boys,
their energy is unreal.

00:35:39.172 --> 00:35:41.605
Ever since that day,
my back hurts when it rains.

00:35:41.605 --> 00:35:44.105
You know what I thought watching that?

00:35:44.105 --> 00:35:46.605
What? 'Kang Du Jun really can do anything.'
Something like that?

00:35:46.605 --> 00:35:49.105
Yes, the Kang Du Jun I know

00:35:49.105 --> 00:35:52.272
is someone who keeps his word no matter what.

00:35:52.272 --> 00:35:54.238
So don't start worrying already.

00:35:54.238 --> 00:35:55.705
You'll do great, okay?

00:35:55.705 --> 00:35:57.605
As a dad,

00:35:57.605 --> 00:35:59.305
and as a husband...

00:36:01.407 --> 00:36:02.885
Jeez.

00:36:03.538 --> 00:36:05.672
You're being unusually serious.

00:36:05.672 --> 00:36:07.538
You're really putting on a whole show.

00:36:07.538 --> 00:36:09.272
Ugh, just go already.

00:36:09.272 --> 00:36:10.272
Well.

00:36:10.272 --> 00:36:12.238
Do the dishes before you leave.

00:36:12.938 --> 00:36:15.705
You are such an annoying type.

00:36:18.372 --> 00:36:19.738
What? The president?

00:36:19.738 --> 00:36:20.772
Whoa, no way.

00:36:20.772 --> 00:36:22.272
Hey, isn't that a total jackpot?

00:36:22.272 --> 00:36:23.705
Jackpot? What are you talking about?

00:36:23.705 --> 00:36:25.272
He completely fooled me.

00:36:25.272 --> 00:36:27.838
How many women must he have charmed
while hiding his identity?

00:36:27.838 --> 00:36:31.238
Well, with that face, women
probably didn't leave him alone.

00:36:31.238 --> 00:36:32.938
It's true.

00:36:34.738 --> 00:36:36.197
But

00:36:36.197 --> 00:36:38.038
don't you have something to tell me?

00:36:38.038 --> 00:36:39.772
What do you mean?

00:36:42.538 --> 00:36:45.472
Should I act like I know it or what?

00:36:46.238 --> 00:36:47.938
Well...

00:36:48.838 --> 00:36:50.772
Like... the guy you've been seeing lately.

00:36:50.772 --> 00:36:53.472
Huh? What did you say?

00:36:53.472 --> 00:36:55.172
That Min...

No, never mind. It's nothing.

00:36:57.905 --> 00:37:00.205
What are you talking about?

00:37:01.072 --> 00:37:02.852
What about you,

00:37:02.852 --> 00:37:04.738
have you decided?

00:37:08.638 --> 00:37:10.938
Looking at your face, I guess not.

00:37:12.538 --> 00:37:15.072
Mi Ran, I actually got accepted
to study in Germany?

00:37:15.072 --> 00:37:16.238
Really?

00:37:16.238 --> 00:37:18.272
Hey, what's there to think about?
The answer is clear.

00:37:18.272 --> 00:37:19.738
Right? That's the right choice, right?

00:37:19.738 --> 00:37:21.705
Right, and honestly,

00:37:21.705 --> 00:37:23.838
haven't you sacrificed
everything for that company?

00:37:23.838 --> 00:37:25.938
Overtime, weekend work...

00:37:25.938 --> 00:37:28.105
You're still young. Go study abroad.

00:37:28.105 --> 00:37:31.205
Go study abroad first,

00:37:31.205 --> 00:37:34.305

Do they still celebrate your birthday
at school these days?

00:37:46.705 --> 00:37:48.872
You probably already blew out the candles.

00:37:49.672 --> 00:37:54.738
Even the department doesn't care.
Who would celebrate a part-time lecturer?

00:37:54.738 --> 00:37:58.372
Still, in the past, you used to
get cake and letters.

00:37:58.372 --> 00:38:00.238
You take it and eat it.

00:38:01.505 --> 00:38:04.205
Throw it away or give it to someone,
do whatever you want.

00:38:04.205 --> 00:38:06.538
I don't want to do things
I don't want to either.

00:38:17.105 --> 00:38:19.538
It was your choice.

00:38:19.538 --> 00:38:24.105
Whether it was a marriage forced by me
or whatever, it was your choice.

00:38:24.905 --> 00:38:26.338
What are you trying to say?

00:38:26.338 --> 00:38:28.272
I'm just curious.

00:38:28.272 --> 00:38:32.205
Curious why I was so hated
for something that wasn't my fault.

00:38:32.938 --> 00:38:34.438
If you regret it that much,

00:38:34.438 --> 00:38:36.272
you shouldn't have had me.

00:38:36.272 --> 00:38:38.805
Why give birth to me
and suffer your whole life? Why?

00:38:38.805 --> 00:38:40.372
Yes, you know it well.

00:38:40.372 --> 00:38:43.372
Giving birth to you was
a mistake from the start.

00:38:43.372 --> 00:38:46.938
My life has been a mess
ever since then. Satisfied?

What?

00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:51.838
Did you want me to say it wasn't?

00:38:54.572 --> 00:38:59.472
Why bring up old stuff just to hurt me?

00:39:01.705 --> 00:39:03.605
Is this why you came?

00:39:03.605 --> 00:39:05.938
Just to upset me?

I'm pregnant.

That's why I came today.

Not even married, and you are pregnant?

00:39:27.538 --> 00:39:28.538
Why would you say it like that?

00:39:28.538 --> 00:39:29.605
If you're going to
get rid of it anyway, hurry up.

Are you going to keep it?

Just a little while ago,

00:39:35.605 --> 00:39:39.138
weren't you the one making
a huge fuss about studying abroad?

You're going to walk the same path as me?

00:39:46.505 --> 00:39:48.453
you won't be reminded
of everything you gave up

Are you sure you won't regret it?

[Obstetrics and Gynecology]

00:41:22.072 --> 00:41:24.805
You were diagnosed with
an endometrioma a few years ago.

00:41:24.805 --> 00:41:27.538
You clearly said pregnancy
would be difficult then.

00:41:27.538 --> 00:41:29.538
It was indeed a difficult situation.

00:41:29.538 --> 00:41:32.572
But seeing the yolk sac
perfectly settled in the womb,

00:41:32.572 --> 00:41:34.638
this is truly a miracle.

Still, if you overexert or get stressed,

00:41:38.005 --> 00:41:40.705
you risk miscarriage
so you must be extra careful.

00:45:01.505 --> 00:45:03.905
Hey, are you okay?

00:45:03.905 --> 00:45:05.305
You said he was a stranger.

00:45:05.305 --> 00:45:06.472
Then does that punk know?

00:45:06.472 --> 00:45:09.538
Forget it, give me his number.
I'll deal with this scoundrel.

00:45:09.538 --> 00:45:11.872
Ugh, stop it. What can you do?

00:45:11.872 --> 00:45:12.972
What do you mean?

00:45:12.972 --> 00:45:15.672
I should grab his collar
and demand responsibility.

00:45:15.672 --> 00:45:19.172
I'm not a kid anymore.
What responsibility are you talking about?

00:45:19.172 --> 00:45:21.138
I chose it anyway.

00:45:21.138 --> 00:45:22.205
You chose?

00:45:22.205 --> 00:45:24.872
What? Am I not allowed to?

00:45:24.872 --> 00:45:26.725
Are you

00:45:26.725 --> 00:45:28.438
really the Jang Hui Won I know?

00:45:28.438 --> 00:45:29.638
And what about you?

00:45:29.638 --> 00:45:31.305
I know everything too.

00:45:31.305 --> 00:45:33.372
About you and Mi Ran.

00:45:34.738 --> 00:45:37.238
I saw it, by chance.

00:45:37.238 --> 00:45:39.405
Hey, wait.

00:45:39.405 --> 00:45:40.872
Saw what?

00:45:40.872 --> 00:45:42.205
You two are dating.

00:45:42.205 --> 00:45:46.372
How could you do this without telling me?

00:45:46.372 --> 00:45:48.305
That's not it.

00:45:49.338 --> 00:45:51.872
I'm not dating Mi Ran.

00:45:53.138 --> 00:45:55.738
But I even saw you kissing.

00:45:55.738 --> 00:45:57.438
What?

00:45:58.972 --> 00:46:01.438
Wow, it's Cha Min Uk!

00:46:01.438 --> 00:46:03.405
- Hey, Cha Min Uk!
- Careful!

00:46:03.405 --> 00:46:05.905
Did you drink again?

00:46:05.905 --> 00:46:07.205
Yeah, team dinner.

00:46:07.205 --> 00:46:08.738
Ugh, you reek of alcohol.

00:46:08.738 --> 00:46:12.905
But I ditched the dinner to come see you.

00:46:12.905 --> 00:46:14.005
I did good, right?

00:46:14.005 --> 00:46:16.772
Good job. Get inside and rest now.

00:46:16.772 --> 00:46:18.072
Oh, right, this.

00:46:18.072 --> 00:46:20.505
You said you've been
craving my rolled omelet.

00:46:20.505 --> 00:46:22.338
- Yeah.
- I added flying fish roe.

00:46:22.338 --> 00:46:23.405
Make sure to eat it later.

00:46:23.405 --> 00:46:24.838
Ah, I love it.

00:46:24.838 --> 00:46:28.105
Ah, I love it! Cha Min Uk, you're the best!

00:46:29.472 --> 00:46:31.238
Hey, Hwang Mi Ran!

00:46:33.272 --> 00:46:35.005
Do you

00:46:35.672 --> 00:46:37.738
want to go out with me?

00:46:37.738 --> 00:46:39.538
- What?
- I'm asking you out.

00:46:39.538 --> 00:46:41.572
I like you.

00:46:51.505 --> 00:46:54.172
So you rejected her.

00:46:54.172 --> 00:46:56.605
I didn't even know.

00:46:57.305 --> 00:46:59.372
Enough about that.

00:47:00.405 --> 00:47:02.172
What will you do now?

00:47:02.172 --> 00:47:04.338
You're not actually going
to keep it, are you?

00:47:08.972 --> 00:47:10.938
Are you even thinking
about marrying that guy?

00:47:10.938 --> 00:47:14.172
No, it's not like that.

00:47:14.172 --> 00:47:15.538
You always said

00:47:15.538 --> 00:47:17.405
you didn't want to end up like your mom.

00:47:17.405 --> 00:47:20.972
I don't want you
to make a choice you'll regret.

00:47:22.005 --> 00:47:23.672
I know.

00:47:23.672 --> 00:47:26.138
But I just need

00:47:26.138 --> 00:47:28.738
a little more time to think.

00:47:32.638 --> 00:47:34.605
Ah, what?

00:47:38.238 --> 00:47:41.205
Call me if it gets hard. Even at dawn.

00:47:41.205 --> 00:47:43.038
Got it.

00:47:48.238 --> 00:47:50.272
Here.

00:47:50.272 --> 00:47:51.972
Thank you.

00:47:55.272 --> 00:47:57.705
Go.

00:47:57.705 --> 00:47:59.605
Hurry.

00:48:01.572 --> 00:48:04.105
- I'll leave.
- Go.

00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:22.272
Do you like that man?

00:48:22.272 --> 00:48:25.005
Oh, my! You scared me!

00:48:25.005 --> 00:48:27.572
But how did you find my place?

00:48:27.572 --> 00:48:29.572
Are you two dating?

00:48:29.572 --> 00:48:31.905
No, it's not like that.

00:48:31.905 --> 00:48:34.172
I just thought you two
looked all lovey-dovey.

00:48:34.172 --> 00:48:37.538
Seriously, we're just friends.

00:48:37.538 --> 00:48:39.272
Hey.

00:48:40.005 --> 00:48:41.605
No, President.

00:48:41.605 --> 00:48:44.738
How could you lie to me perfectly?

00:48:44.738 --> 00:48:46.605
What exactly did I lie about?

00:48:46.605 --> 00:48:50.805
Please pretend you don't know me at work.

00:48:52.105 --> 00:48:54.038
Fine.

00:48:54.038 --> 00:48:56.472
- What?
- I'll do as you wish.

00:48:56.472 --> 00:48:58.338
But,

00:48:58.338 --> 00:49:01.905
whoever your heart belongs to,
it's none of my business.

00:49:01.905 --> 00:49:05.572
But I do expect us both
to take responsibility for our actions.

00:49:22.772 --> 00:49:24.505
Does that make sense?

So how was your first day?

00:50:00.305 --> 00:50:03.538
Wow, it was so hectic and nerve-wracking.

00:50:03.538 --> 00:50:05.838
I didn't even know whether food
was going into my mouth or my nose.

00:50:05.838 --> 00:50:08.838
If it weren't for the chocolate you gave me,
I would've been in big trouble.

00:50:08.838 --> 00:50:10.038
That stuff is expensive.

00:50:10.038 --> 00:50:12.438
I gave it to you because it's you.

00:50:12.438 --> 00:50:14.072
But our connection is really something.

00:50:14.072 --> 00:50:15.905
Middle school, high school, college,

and now we work at the same company?

00:50:17.472 --> 00:50:19.138
Why? I like it.

00:50:19.138 --> 00:50:22.538
Weren't we supposed to
stick together forever?

00:50:22.538 --> 00:50:24.338
Huh?

Wow, he has such presence.

Based on the results, we plan
to go full-scale product development phase.

Are you crazy? What if you mess that up?

00:57:08.772 --> 00:57:10.172
Don't even think about leaving work today.

00:57:10.172 --> 00:57:13.705
Fix it now and email it
to me. Get it together!

00:57:17.672 --> 00:57:21.445
I'll get off here.

00:57:21.445 --> 00:57:25.477
- Take care.
- Then, I'll get going.

00:57:31.205 --> 00:57:34.305
Huh? Wait, don't you need these?

00:57:34.305 --> 00:57:36.738
You should take them with you.

00:57:37.572 --> 00:57:41.038
For the first half of next year,
we're exploring a plan

00:57:41.038 --> 00:57:45.505
to develop a new product by reducing
the calories of our existing Try beer.

00:57:45.505 --> 00:57:46.738
We're also considering
seasonal promotional items.

00:57:46.738 --> 00:57:48.372
- Did you get dragged here?
- For that,

00:57:48.372 --> 00:57:49.738
- Lighten up a little.
- we plan to collaborate with other brands.

00:57:49.738 --> 00:57:54.372
We'll showcase collaborative products
with various brands to customers.

00:57:54.372 --> 00:57:57.305
That concludes the briefing.

00:57:58.305 --> 00:58:00.538
Call me if it gets hard. Even at dawn.

00:58:00.538 --> 00:58:02.272
Got it.

00:58:09.272 --> 00:58:12.172
Thank you for your hard work
preparing the presentation.

00:58:12.905 --> 00:58:15.505
- Not at all.
- Everyone received bonuses last time, right?

00:58:15.505 --> 00:58:17.405
Ah, we were extremely grateful.

00:58:17.405 --> 00:58:19.438
We were all completely surprised.

00:58:19.438 --> 00:58:22.472
Right? President, you are the best.

00:58:25.072 --> 00:58:28.305
Then you should earn your pay.

00:58:28.305 --> 00:58:30.505
I'm not saying work harder
because you got bonuses.

00:58:30.505 --> 00:58:34.038
But you should at least work
to the level of your salaries.

00:58:34.038 --> 00:58:38.072
If there's anything lacking...

00:58:39.705 --> 00:58:40.705
Everything.

00:58:40.705 --> 00:58:44.605
The annual 3-year new product design report
due every September is inadequate.

00:58:44.605 --> 00:58:47.038
By now, winter promotions
should be finalized as a baseline.

00:58:47.038 --> 00:58:49.938
Next half-year's product proposals
should've been ready too.

00:58:49.938 --> 00:58:51.305
Based solely on today's briefing,

00:58:51.305 --> 00:58:53.872
there are zero concrete cases.

00:58:56.738 --> 00:58:58.872
Since it's our first meeting together,

00:58:58.872 --> 00:59:01.238
please provide more
detailed enhancements moving forward.

00:59:01.238 --> 00:59:04.405
Yes, we'll fix this.

00:59:05.438 --> 00:59:06.905
Ah, one more thing.

00:59:06.905 --> 00:59:10.972
Is the Germany program selectee
in this New Product Development Team?

00:59:10.972 --> 00:59:12.105
Yes.

00:59:12.105 --> 00:59:15.205
Our team's Manager Jang Hui Won was chosen.

00:59:16.638 --> 00:59:18.805
Ah, I see.

00:59:18.805 --> 00:59:20.505
Manager Jang Hui Won.

00:59:21.838 --> 00:59:22.972
Yes?

00:59:22.972 --> 00:59:25.505
Do you actually intend to go to Germany?

00:59:25.505 --> 00:59:28.605
I know there are plenty of responsibilities
here requiring your attention.

00:59:28.605 --> 00:59:30.738
Wouldn't it be overwhelming?

00:59:39.013 --> 00:59:40.405
Jeez.

00:59:40.405 --> 00:59:42.338
His personality is something else.

00:59:42.338 --> 00:59:44.505
But why is he treating
Manager Jang like that?

00:59:44.505 --> 00:59:47.472
Exactly. Manager Jang
really wants to go to Germany.

00:59:47.472 --> 00:59:49.472
Right, Manager Jang?

00:59:55.272 --> 00:59:57.205
You told me not to act like
I know you at work.

00:59:57.205 --> 00:59:58.572
People might misunderstand.

00:59:58.572 --> 01:00:01.938
I knew you were annoying,
but this is downright shameless.

01:00:01.938 --> 01:00:04.038
Why would you ask that there?

01:00:04.038 --> 01:00:05.372
Because I'm curious.

01:00:05.372 --> 01:00:07.705
I have no idea what you think.

01:00:07.705 --> 01:00:09.205
Since we're on the subject, let me ask.

01:00:09.205 --> 01:00:10.805
Are you going to keep the baby?

01:00:10.805 --> 01:00:12.738
I haven't decided yet.

01:00:12.738 --> 01:00:16.605
Even if I do, I won't marry you.

01:00:19.138 --> 01:00:21.605
You said it doesn't matter who I like.

01:00:21.605 --> 01:00:25.638
Plus, it's a waste of time discussing this
with someone who views marriage as business.

01:00:25.638 --> 01:00:28.105
And I'll never have a loveless marriage.

01:00:28.105 --> 01:00:30.705
Let's just stop all of this here.

01:00:32.072 --> 01:00:33.338
You're bold even without alcohol.

01:00:33.338 --> 01:00:34.338
What did you say?

01:00:34.338 --> 01:00:35.738
You said before, didn't you?

01:00:35.738 --> 01:00:38.472
That it's your own business
and you'll take responsibility.

01:00:38.472 --> 01:00:40.205
But...

01:00:41.672 --> 01:00:44.105
Now that I know about it,

01:00:44.105 --> 01:00:47.672
this is my business too.

01:00:47.672 --> 01:00:51.572
So let's meet at least three times a week.

01:00:51.572 --> 01:00:55.238
- What?
- Love. Let's give it a try properly.

01:01:34.138 --> 01:01:35.972
Let's just say we both enjoyed it.

01:01:35.972 --> 01:01:37.172
- Keep it cool.
- Cool?

01:01:37.172 --> 01:01:39.672
I let it slide that she was with another man,
and this is how she treats me?

01:01:39.672 --> 01:01:41.638
Either treat her well
or torment her. Pick one.

01:01:41.638 --> 01:01:43.072
You're not seeking revenge, are you?

01:01:43.072 --> 01:01:45.005
How did you feel about
the father of Hui Won's child?

01:01:45.005 --> 01:01:46.872
Are you here to ask about that now?

01:01:46.872 --> 01:01:48.272
Then what about taking it slow?

01:01:48.272 --> 01:01:49.305
I don't want to stop.

01:01:49.305 --> 01:01:51.372
The secret woman,
Kang Du Jun's illegitimate child.

01:01:51.372 --> 01:01:53.072
We just need to frame it, right?

01:01:53.072 --> 01:01:57.503
Because of you, our entire team
is about to be investigated.

01:01:57.503 --> 01:01:58.938
Ow.

01:01:58.938 --> 01:02:01.605
President, we've got a serious problem.
