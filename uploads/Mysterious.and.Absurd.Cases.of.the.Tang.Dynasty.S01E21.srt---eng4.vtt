00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.680
There is a place in Chang'an City...

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.160
adjacent to the Ghost Market.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.080
Peddlers,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.880
merchants,

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.080
and commoners live together.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.840
There are the filthy rich,

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.560
and those living in misery,

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.080
penniless.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.640
This place...

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.440
is Wuben Fang.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.320
Cry, cry, cry!

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.920
Hu Laohan, control your grandson!

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.160
It's the middle of the night!

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.320
Are you going to let us sleep or not?

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.520
Afraid people don't know

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.680
you got a grandson, huh?

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.760
Hu Laohan!

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.880
Hu Laohan!

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.480
Fine.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.800
If I can't sleep,

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.200
none of us will sleep!

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.480
Fool!

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.320
Where's your father?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.200
Your son is crying like that,

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.880
and neither of you does anything?

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.880
Fool!

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.600
Hu Laohan!

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.040
Hu Laohan!

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.320
Hu Laohan!

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.200
The child is crying like this and no one cares.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.160
Hu Laohan!

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.600
Hu Laohan!

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.400
Hu Laohan!

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.280
Why did you go to Hu Pin's house late at night?

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.400
Hu Pin's grandson wouldn't stop crying.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.400
It was so loud I couldn't sleep.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.640
My lord, it really has nothing to do with me!

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.680
I didn't do it!

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.120
Ask them!

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.520
Someone else must have heard it too.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.920
Say something!

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.800
Say something!

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.760
Why won't you speak?

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.080
My lord,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.480
I have no grudge against Hu Pin.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.120
At most, I just looked down on him.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.840
I mocked him for having a foolish son.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.520
They... they all cursed Hu Pin too!

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.840
Usually, you all

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.560
point fingers at Hu Pin too!

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.960
Why are you all mute now?

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.240
The fatal wound is in the heart.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.760
Caused by a sharp weapon.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.760
One strike killed him.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.480
A suture line runs from the heart to the abdomen.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.160
A straw doll was stuffed into the abdomen.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.480
The stomach and intestines were crushed.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.640
What kind of immense hatred

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.440
would drive someone to cast such a vicious curse?

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.920
A curse?

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.000
Ancient records state

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.960
that placing a straw doll in a person's belly

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.640
means even if the deceased is reincarnated,

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.160
it will end his bloodline.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.480
But the strange thing is,

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.320
even with such great hatred,

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.440
the killer

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.080
actually spared Hu Pin's foolish son

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.560
and his little grandson.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.080
The one who couldn't bear to hurt them

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.040
is most likely

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.080
Hu Ya's wife.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.400
Come again next time!

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.800
Feather dusters!

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.280
Sachets! Little bells!

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.640
Sir, what do you need?

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.400
Are you the Gossipmonger they talk about?

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.400
I'm just a peddler.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.800
I wander the streets and alleys,

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.760
so regarding everyone's business,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.960
I do know a little bit.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.840
You know Hu Ya, right?

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.880
I do.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.680
The fool from East Street.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.240
I know him.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.600
Then do you know where he got his wife?

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.560
Got?

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.280
Pfft!

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.240
Hu Ya's mother died early.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.480
His father, Hu Pin, was a good-for-nothing.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.320
And he himself is a fool.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.600
Where could he possibly get a wife?

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.240
Then why was that woman willing to marry into the Hu family?

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.120
What is her background?

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.280
Well...

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.040
They say she was found.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.520
Found?

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.640
If she was really found,

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.840
the Hu family wouldn't have been the ones to get her.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.600
If you ask me, most likely,

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.080
they spent all their family savings to buy her.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.360
You have no idea.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.720
That Hu Pin, who's always been looked down upon,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.280
can finally hold his head up high this time.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.640
Goods for sale! Goods for sale!

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.280
Small rattle drums!

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.800
That Hu Pin...

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.760
Ladies.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.200
Is your tongue itching again?

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.840
Whose gossip are you chewing on now?

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.920
Shoo, shoo! You're everywhere!

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.680
Tell me.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.560
Tell me about it, let me hear.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.960
What else is there to say?

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.240
Here comes the man himself, doesn't he?

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.240
So beautiful.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.800
Old Man Hu.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.000
You look radiant with joy.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.480
I was afraid the child would get bored at home,

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:57.840
so I brought him out for a stroll.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.200
Old Man Hu, became a father again?

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.880
A father again?

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.040
What kind of talk is that?

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.760
Don't laugh, don't laugh.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.920
This is Hu Ya's child.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:09.680
My grandson.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.280
Look, it's a boy.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.640
A boy! He looks so beautiful.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.160
Congratulations, Old Man Hu.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.040
Take this as my gift for the little boy.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.760
Good, good, thank you.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.360
That Old Man Hu...

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.400
He's a decent man.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.760
I usually just tease him for fun.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.920
What does that woman look like?

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.000
Haven't seen her.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.240
But I heard...

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.720
ever since that woman entered the Hu family,

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.880
the Hu family's front door

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.520
has been kept shut all day long.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:42.600
And this Hu Pin,

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.360
really treats that woman like a treasure.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.640
Terrified someone might steal her away.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:49.720
Alright.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.040
May your business prosper, boss.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.080
Come back next time!

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.360
Come back if you need anything!

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.240
My Lord.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.200
I've asked around and clarified.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.360
Hu Ya indeed had a wife.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:35.120
But...

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.800
she disappeared after giving birth to the Hu family's boy.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:42.800
Lao Yao.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:43.720
Hmm?

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.720
The Longevity Lock.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:47.720
This item...

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.600
is not cheap to make.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.120
The Hu family isn't wealthy.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.320
How could they afford to make this?

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:56.720
This object is brand new.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.200
It looks like it was made recently.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.640
Could it be that before Hu Pin died,

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.000
he came into a windfall?

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.040
Guiyi.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.400
Go check the nearby silver shops.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:07.400
Yes, sir.
