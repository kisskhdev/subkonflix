00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.040
(Previously)
Welcome to Cat-Cheer Café.

00:00:02.313 --> 00:00:04.145
That one is named Lynx. He's my son.

00:00:04.239 --> 00:00:05.518
He ran off and became a stray.

00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:06.567
He's a tough nut to crack.

00:00:06.614 --> 00:00:08.123
If anyone can make him blink back,

00:00:08.177 --> 00:00:10.490
I'm ready to give him up, along with this café.

00:00:12.657 --> 00:00:13.657
Je, Je Meow.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.130
Je! Je!

00:00:15.865 --> 00:00:16.865
Meow~

00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:20.307
(Hey! Call an ambulance now!)

00:00:20.471 --> 00:00:21.609
What happened to me?

00:00:21.864 --> 00:00:23.382
Yeah, I really can hear them talking.

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:24.475
Who are you talking to?

00:00:25.633 --> 00:00:28.352
Have you decided what to do with the café?

00:00:28.437 --> 00:00:30.150
I'm not going to continue it.
You can use it to pay off the debt.

00:00:30.261 --> 00:00:31.420
Keep running this café.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.412
Your mom loved every cat like her own kids.

00:00:33.865 --> 00:00:37.677
Your mother and grandfather
each loved their child more than anything.

00:00:39.386 --> 00:00:42.201
You pay to watch cats sleep, what's so fun about that?

00:00:42.428 --> 00:00:45.362
To you, this place might just be a café.

00:00:45.456 --> 00:00:48.410
But to them, it's their whole world.

00:00:48.891 --> 00:00:49.851
I've signed them all.

00:00:49.964 --> 00:00:50.994
Just need your signature now.

00:00:51.281 --> 00:00:54.159
My big boss will send in his son to sign.

00:00:55.547 --> 00:00:58.252
Now you're my debtor.

00:00:58.416 --> 00:01:01.407
If you break the contract, don't say I didn't warn you.

00:01:09.726 --> 00:01:10.818
(My name is Tiger.)

00:01:10.885 --> 00:01:12.133
(I'm allergic to cats.)

00:01:12.543 --> 00:01:14.512
(I can't even pet one.)

00:01:14.653 --> 00:01:16.319
(So there's no way my family
would let me keep one at home.)

00:01:16.365 --> 00:01:19.718
(The only place I can get my cat fix is…)

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.390
Kids.

00:01:31.583 --> 00:01:33.587
Come hear your today's missions
from this mentor.

00:01:33.686 --> 00:01:35.046
We'll start with…

00:01:36.422 --> 00:01:37.530
Jenny.

00:01:37.797 --> 00:01:39.745
My pretty head of PR.

00:01:39.826 --> 00:01:41.346
School has started.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.133
Use your charm to bring in
more students, okay?

00:01:43.218 --> 00:01:44.807
(Okay~)

00:01:44.927 --> 00:01:46.062
Aww. So cute.

00:01:46.227 --> 00:01:48.854
John Wick, my cool head of security.

00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:50.722
We've got some new cats in the house.

00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:52.646
Help me keep things under control.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.718
(Roger that.)

00:01:53.785 --> 00:01:54.999
Captain Jiro.

00:01:55.144 --> 00:01:57.098
It's our first day doing deliveries.

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:58.694
Help me check that the orders
are queued properly.

00:02:00.227 --> 00:02:01.045
Jumbo,

00:02:01.115 --> 00:02:02.349
you'd better be on your
best behavior today, alright?

00:02:02.383 --> 00:02:04.097
(Jumbo's always on his best behavior.)

00:02:04.175 --> 00:02:06.006
Granny Juu,

00:02:06.618 --> 00:02:09.093
just stay in your little circle
and wish me luck, okay?

00:02:09.376 --> 00:02:10.926
Ready to handle your missions?

00:02:11.021 --> 00:02:12.483
(Yes!)

00:02:15.674 --> 00:02:20.111
Granny Juu, let's see
who our first customer's gonna be.

00:02:23.637 --> 00:02:26.215
Welcome to Cat-Cheer Café.

00:02:44.065 --> 00:02:45.468
Come on, Jumbo.

00:02:45.527 --> 00:02:47.410
Why don't you come down
and play with customers?

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:51.258
Hey, shut the door.
The cats are gonna run out.

00:02:53.918 --> 00:02:55.157
Oi, oi.

00:02:55.235 --> 00:02:57.113
It hurts.

00:02:57.178 --> 00:02:58.659
Oi. Argh.

00:02:58.706 --> 00:02:59.630
Jumbo, you're hurting me.

00:02:59.705 --> 00:03:00.544
Jumbo.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.936
You're just gonna stand there?
Help me.

00:03:01.974 --> 00:03:03.602
-Oi, Jumbo.
-How?

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.417
-I'm allergic to cat fur.
-Come on, Jumbo.

00:03:06.477 --> 00:03:08.277
You want my shirt that bad?
Fine, take it.

00:03:08.414 --> 00:03:10.008
Hey. Hey!

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:31.629
What are you looking at?

00:03:38.473 --> 00:03:40.205
I got scratched all over, Jumbo!

00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:51.403
Put your shirt back on.

00:04:00.598 --> 00:04:05.047
How did your mom do
to get the cats downstairs?

00:04:07.925 --> 00:04:09.075
Ask them.

00:04:09.724 --> 00:04:11.209
If I knew, I'd have done it already.

00:04:11.887 --> 00:04:15.409
Don't tell me…
you don't know how to run this café.

00:04:16.052 --> 00:04:16.852
Hey.

00:04:17.075 --> 00:04:18.877
This is my mom's café, not mine.

00:04:19.671 --> 00:04:22.500
Does every noodle shop kid
know how to make noodles?

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.370
Fair enough.

00:04:33.678 --> 00:04:36.744
Well then…
do you want me to help?

00:04:38.081 --> 00:04:41.701
I've been eating here all the time.

00:04:42.632 --> 00:04:43.632
No, thank you.

00:04:43.859 --> 00:04:45.183
I've got someone who can help me.

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:46.954
Your partner?

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:54.462
ChatGPT.

00:04:58.386 --> 00:05:02.270
How do you run a cat café
if you hate cats?

00:05:05.803 --> 00:05:08.915
Your mom didn't raise you
with ChatGPT, did she?

00:05:10.158 --> 00:05:11.958
To work with living beings,

00:05:13.401 --> 00:05:14.898
you've got to give your heart first.

00:05:23.001 --> 00:05:25.401
If you want to add them as a friend,
you have to…

00:05:25.474 --> 00:05:26.514
Blink, right?

00:05:27.528 --> 00:05:29.096
I've tried so much
my eyes are about to get stuck.

00:05:29.388 --> 00:05:30.388
It didn't work.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.804
If that didn't work,
how about you "shake hands" with them?

00:05:41.656 --> 00:05:44.859
I mean…
people greet with handshakes.

00:05:45.715 --> 00:05:48.758
Cats greet with nose bumps.

00:05:49.456 --> 00:05:51.123
They won't even make eye contact with me.

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:52.812
Do you want me to bump noses with them?

00:05:52.896 --> 00:05:53.896
Not that.

00:05:54.271 --> 00:05:56.403
I mean, you can just
point your finger like this.

00:06:10.631 --> 00:06:12.101
Hey, what are you doing?

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.198
Now we're friends.

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:18.616
Who said I wanted to be your friend?

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:21.108
That was just practice.

00:06:23.257 --> 00:06:24.297
Alright then.

00:06:24.622 --> 00:06:26.218
Why don't you do it
for real now, Coach?

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:02.006
He's leaning back to sleep.

00:07:03.018 --> 00:07:04.092
It didn't work.

00:07:05.328 --> 00:07:08.449
At least,
he didn't bite you.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.100
"Cat for Cash"
(Episode 2)

00:08:24.699 --> 00:08:25.699
Like food.

00:08:26.626 --> 00:08:28.971
Don't people come here for the cats?

00:08:29.588 --> 00:08:31.792
I can serve some easy fried or frozen stuff.

00:08:33.312 --> 00:08:35.107
Don't let your mom hear you say that.

00:08:35.458 --> 00:08:38.414
The signature dish of this café
is Meow Meow Rice.

00:08:39.257 --> 00:08:42.051
(Your Cat-Cheer Café isn't just about the cats.)

00:08:42.096 --> 00:08:44.675
(It's also known for its heavenly tasty food.)

00:08:44.769 --> 00:08:49.098
(And the signature dish here
is made with crispy fried mackerel,)

00:08:49.296 --> 00:08:51.297
(mashed into freshly cooked rice,)

00:08:51.403 --> 00:08:53.096
(seasoned with fresh ingredients,)

00:08:53.157 --> 00:08:56.240
(and served with the café's secret fish sauce dip.)

00:08:56.302 --> 00:08:59.097
(This dish is called Meow Meow Rice.)

00:09:05.744 --> 00:09:06.813
Do you know the recipe?

00:09:11.684 --> 00:09:12.686
I actually don't.

00:09:13.507 --> 00:09:15.823
But I ate it every day.

00:09:16.847 --> 00:09:18.594
I might be able to guess it.

00:09:21.086 --> 00:09:22.786
Show me how to make Meow Meow Rice.

00:09:25.359 --> 00:09:28.440
(I'm the one who taught Je Meow this dish.)

00:09:28.535 --> 00:09:29.535
Ah, right.

00:09:29.837 --> 00:09:31.387
Jiro used to be a restaurant cat.

00:09:32.195 --> 00:09:33.195
Who are you talking to?

00:09:33.352 --> 00:09:34.392
(Oops, meow!)

00:09:35.949 --> 00:09:36.949
No one.

00:09:37.419 --> 00:09:41.608
I just remembered
your mom used to teach me.

00:09:44.383 --> 00:09:46.217
I think it starts with…

00:09:47.881 --> 00:09:49.166
what was it?

00:09:49.283 --> 00:09:51.509
(Get the mackerel and pat the skin dry.)

00:09:51.682 --> 00:09:53.102
Get the mackerel and pat the skin dry.

00:09:54.424 --> 00:09:56.880
It starts with taking the mackerel out
and patting the skin dry.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.033
Pat the skin dry, and then…

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:02.680
what's next?

00:10:08.646 --> 00:10:10.508
What kind of person likes to talk to himself?

00:10:10.969 --> 00:10:12.914
(Will he get it done today?)

00:10:25.385 --> 00:10:26.652
Oh, it's hot.

00:10:31.795 --> 00:10:32.820
Take it easy there.

00:10:33.607 --> 00:10:35.205
You have such a cat's tongue.

00:11:22.066 --> 00:11:24.273
So? Is it good?

00:11:25.745 --> 00:11:26.745
Mhm.

00:11:28.686 --> 00:11:29.686
It's good.

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:33.106
But I don't know if it's the same
as what Mom made.

00:11:34.759 --> 00:11:36.297
Je Meow never made it for you?

00:11:40.957 --> 00:11:41.957
She did.

00:11:43.727 --> 00:11:45.407
But I couldn't remember.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:46.900
It was too long ago.

00:11:48.152 --> 00:11:50.805
Now I know
why the cats ignore you.

00:11:52.123 --> 00:11:53.150
That's not it.

00:11:53.402 --> 00:11:54.699
I'm Granny Juu's kid, you know.

00:11:54.954 --> 00:11:56.602
When I was little,
Granny Juu raised me.

00:11:58.038 --> 00:11:59.185
When I was little,

00:12:00.622 --> 00:12:02.502
my dad always dragged me along
to collect debts.

00:12:03.097 --> 00:12:04.413
Don't you have to go collect debts today?

00:12:04.652 --> 00:12:06.309
Why are you here helping
a debtor like me?

00:12:07.695 --> 00:12:09.094
Because if I don't,

00:12:10.089 --> 00:12:11.611
do you really think you can
run this café on your own?

00:12:13.012 --> 00:12:14.402
I thought you were helping
out of fondness.

00:12:19.893 --> 00:12:20.893
Fondness? For what?

00:12:21.631 --> 00:12:22.631
The cats.

00:12:24.853 --> 00:12:26.533
Yes, I'm fond of cats.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.004
The cats in this café…
are cute.

00:12:36.884 --> 00:12:38.004
For this first period,

00:12:38.704 --> 00:12:42.473
I think I'm going to skip
the complicated dishes.

00:12:43.201 --> 00:12:44.700
I'll go with simple ones first.

00:12:45.593 --> 00:12:47.033
I'm all by myself.

00:12:48.073 --> 00:12:49.298
I don't think I can handle
everything alone.

00:12:50.928 --> 00:12:51.928
Well…

00:12:55.251 --> 00:12:56.931
don't you think about
finding someone to help?

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:16.004
(Tiger! Everything's gone completely off the rails!)

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.293
(This isn't the dish we used to have.)

00:13:28.453 --> 00:13:30.386
(It smells weird and tastes bland.)

00:13:30.453 --> 00:13:31.700
(Go get the chef.)

00:13:32.127 --> 00:13:33.413
Did you change the cat food?

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:34.880
Yes.

00:13:35.107 --> 00:13:36.353
Not only that,

00:13:37.153 --> 00:13:38.420
I changed the litter too.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.193
(I don't like this litter.)

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.240
(It's dusty and rough.)

00:13:42.833 --> 00:13:44.000
Why did you change them?

00:13:44.373 --> 00:13:45.506
The old ones were fine.

00:13:45.587 --> 00:13:48.406
That's why Mom couldn't pay you off.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.720
Even though I cut costs,
the quality is the same.

00:13:51.907 --> 00:13:53.433
(No, it's not!)

00:13:53.507 --> 00:13:54.923
But you know, cats are—

00:14:06.158 --> 00:14:07.158
Shh.

00:14:08.777 --> 00:14:10.498
I'm doing all this for a creditor like you.

00:14:20.539 --> 00:14:23.605
You guys, give it a try.

00:14:25.406 --> 00:14:27.911
You might just not be used to
the new stuff yet.

00:14:28.622 --> 00:14:31.538
(Hey, you need to push back,
not take his side.)

00:14:33.533 --> 00:14:34.705
Knock yourselves out.

00:14:34.939 --> 00:14:36.555
Tomorrow's reopening day.

00:14:36.794 --> 00:14:37.794
You'll need energy.

00:14:38.033 --> 00:14:42.166
(Fine. You'll be using plenty of energy too.)

00:14:57.872 --> 00:15:00.211
Getting them out here isn't that hard.

00:15:00.994 --> 00:15:02.394
Just give them food.

00:15:12.794 --> 00:15:13.872
Cat-Cheer Café—

00:15:18.166 --> 00:15:19.437
What's with that face?

00:15:20.183 --> 00:15:21.183
Aren't you glad?

00:15:22.328 --> 00:15:24.008
I'm your first customer.

00:15:24.189 --> 00:15:26.116
Customer, or creditor here to nitpick me?

00:15:27.483 --> 00:15:29.111
Speaking of nitpicking,

00:15:29.944 --> 00:15:31.811
this is the time you should
block the cats now.

00:15:31.888 --> 00:15:34.327
Make way for the Cold Prince.

00:15:34.394 --> 00:15:36.205
Hey, close the door first.

00:15:39.967 --> 00:15:41.527
Hi, P'Tiger.

00:15:42.094 --> 00:15:43.294
Please forgive me.

00:15:43.411 --> 00:15:47.116
I didn't know you were from
a prominent family.

00:15:47.261 --> 00:15:48.505
Come on, Krapor.

00:15:48.772 --> 00:15:50.216
Just call me Tiger like before.

00:15:50.439 --> 00:15:51.483
We're all cat lovers.

00:15:52.261 --> 00:15:53.616
Just Tiger like before?

00:15:56.138 --> 00:15:57.600
I'll take that as permission, dude.

00:15:59.983 --> 00:16:02.194
I'm kidding!
I'm just kidding

00:16:02.433 --> 00:16:03.433
Anyway, bro.

00:16:03.622 --> 00:16:08.311
I want to spoil Jenny
with two or three creamy treats.

00:16:09.611 --> 00:16:12.911
Why are they all hiding today?

00:16:15.011 --> 00:16:18.394
(If you want us to get out there,
change everything back to how it was.)

00:16:21.711 --> 00:16:22.711
Lynx.

00:16:23.556 --> 00:16:28.038
I think they're protesting
because you changed their stuff.

00:16:30.994 --> 00:16:32.794
Can't you guys just behave?

00:16:36.706 --> 00:16:37.822
How about this?

00:16:39.822 --> 00:16:43.605
Premium creamy cat treats
made with high-quality ingredients.

00:16:43.867 --> 00:16:45.788
It smells good, and it tastes even better!

00:16:48.078 --> 00:16:50.055
(Everyone, stay calm.)

00:16:50.217 --> 00:16:52.300
(I've been through this game before.)

00:16:53.417 --> 00:16:56.477
(Ugh! You bunch of furballs!)

00:16:56.633 --> 00:16:58.433
(I can't trust any of you.)

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:02.633
Jiro, it's almost gone.

00:17:02.728 --> 00:17:07.616
(A cat like me would rather work up a sweat,
than shed tears over a cat treat.)

00:17:07.756 --> 00:17:09.436
-(Hmph, I won't look.)
-Hey, Jiro.

00:17:09.911 --> 00:17:11.305
Wanna play with this?

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:18.433
Tiger told me
this is your favorite toy, right?

00:17:20.661 --> 00:17:22.261
(Stay strong, Jiro.)

00:17:22.627 --> 00:17:23.900
(It's just a plastic bag.)

00:17:25.283 --> 00:17:26.988
(Hehe~)

00:17:28.817 --> 00:17:29.817
Looks like…

00:17:30.689 --> 00:17:32.688
I'm gonna pay off my debt
faster than I thought.

00:17:37.811 --> 00:17:38.694
Awesome.

00:17:44.328 --> 00:17:45.394
Are you tired, Granny Juu?

00:17:45.761 --> 00:17:47.500
You've been working all day.
Your fur's a mess.

00:18:04.389 --> 00:18:05.422
What are you looking at?

00:18:06.589 --> 00:18:08.422
Are you happy seeing me
being a cat servant?

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:10.950
No.

00:18:13.383 --> 00:18:14.500
I'm just jealous.

00:18:21.161 --> 00:18:22.705
You want some brushing too?

00:18:24.489 --> 00:18:25.899
I'm jealous of you.

00:18:28.194 --> 00:18:29.994
For someone allergic to cat fur like me,

00:18:32.383 --> 00:18:33.823
I'd trade anything

00:18:34.833 --> 00:18:36.083
to sit where you are.

00:18:40.078 --> 00:18:41.816
I'd trade anything too

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.605
to just curl up and stay right here.

00:19:05.444 --> 00:19:07.005
Your fur's all messed up.

00:19:20.511 --> 00:19:22.199
Welcome to Cat-Cheer Café.

00:19:22.689 --> 00:19:24.627
Let's get to work, Granny Juu.

00:19:30.456 --> 00:19:31.456
What can I get you?

00:19:32.667 --> 00:19:33.667
Cocoa?

00:19:34.439 --> 00:19:36.805
Matcha too? Please wait a moment.

00:19:38.961 --> 00:19:41.416
Look, you really enjoy it.

00:19:42.322 --> 00:19:43.622
Thought you said this brand wasn't good.

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:48.911
(After dealing with customers all day,
I'm eating whatever's here.)

00:19:56.955 --> 00:19:57.955
Hey, Lynx.

00:19:59.783 --> 00:20:00.811
What are you doing?

00:20:01.449 --> 00:20:02.811
Are you switching to a fan
instead of the AC?

00:20:03.717 --> 00:20:04.994
Cats get hot easily, you know?

00:20:07.217 --> 00:20:08.911
I'm not that mean. Come on.

00:20:09.399 --> 00:20:10.500
I asked ChatGPT.

00:20:10.828 --> 00:20:13.899
It says if you set the AC to 27 and use a fan,

00:20:14.356 --> 00:20:15.905
it saves on the electricity bill.

00:20:21.433 --> 00:20:24.022
(Hey! Don't you know anything at all?)

00:20:24.144 --> 00:20:26.800
(Wind sounds like an eagle hunting!)

00:20:28.778 --> 00:20:31.011
I don't think the cats like it.

00:20:31.722 --> 00:20:32.722
Please take it away.

00:20:36.072 --> 00:20:37.407
And how do you know what they think?

00:20:38.122 --> 00:20:39.122
Did they tell you?

00:20:40.757 --> 00:20:41.750
I just know.

00:20:41.811 --> 00:20:43.516
You think you're the only one who knows?

00:20:45.189 --> 00:20:47.394
You can talk to cats?

00:20:50.866 --> 00:20:51.866
Yes.

00:20:59.022 --> 00:21:01.794
Just using this cat-translation app I just downloaded,

00:21:02.633 --> 00:21:03.633
I can talk to them.

00:21:04.644 --> 00:21:07.316
Kids, you like the fan, right?

00:21:07.778 --> 00:21:09.511
(Noooooo~)

00:21:12.578 --> 00:21:14.905
The app translated, "It feels so good~"

00:21:16.444 --> 00:21:18.427
(How could he believe that app?)

00:21:18.911 --> 00:21:20.605
(Meowwww~)

00:21:28.537 --> 00:21:29.537
Hey.

00:21:29.806 --> 00:21:30.806
Hey!

00:21:33.161 --> 00:21:34.161
Yes?

00:21:37.144 --> 00:21:38.144
Thanks for today.

00:21:41.222 --> 00:21:44.199
For what? I didn't do anything today.

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:46.455
Exactly for that.

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:50.616
You're my creditor,
but you haven't asked me to pay.

00:21:51.544 --> 00:21:52.544
Who says I haven't?

00:21:53.373 --> 00:21:55.111
I'm waiting to collect interest.

00:21:56.111 --> 00:21:57.616
Once things settle down here,

00:21:58.702 --> 00:21:59.716
I'm coming for you.

00:22:01.713 --> 00:22:05.877
Then can I pay
today's interest with this first?

00:22:07.917 --> 00:22:10.427
I just saw we have cat stickers for sale too.

00:22:10.528 --> 00:22:13.605
If it's this version of cats,
you won't be allergic, right?

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:23.250
Do you know

00:22:24.183 --> 00:22:26.911
what your mom used these stickers for?

00:22:27.994 --> 00:22:31.577
For sticking on stuff, right?

00:22:34.489 --> 00:22:37.905
Your mom put these cat stickers on cups

00:22:38.854 --> 00:22:40.711
and wrote sweet little messages for customers.

00:22:41.906 --> 00:22:44.627
She once wrote one for me,

00:22:46.539 --> 00:22:47.899
"Hope you find your favorite cat."

00:22:53.439 --> 00:22:54.439
Can I have one?

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:25.650
Drive safe.

00:23:44.733 --> 00:23:47.127
GIVE ME A BRUSHING :)

00:23:55.217 --> 00:23:56.217
Bro.

00:23:57.771 --> 00:23:58.771
Hey, bro.

00:23:59.622 --> 00:24:00.622
Tiger, bro!

00:24:01.188 --> 00:24:02.399
What are you smiling about?

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:06.100
Where to next?

00:24:07.039 --> 00:24:08.079
The cat café.

00:24:08.717 --> 00:24:10.397
I heard it's open again.

00:24:10.893 --> 00:24:12.303
He should have some cash
to pay us back now.

00:24:16.122 --> 00:24:18.722
You may go. Leave this one to me.

00:24:19.533 --> 00:24:20.533
Huh?

00:24:23.661 --> 00:24:24.927
Just go.

00:24:33.889 --> 00:24:35.300
Cat-Cheer Café. How may I help you?

00:24:35.444 --> 00:24:37.327
(Hi there. It's me, Tiger.)

00:24:39.861 --> 00:24:41.105
How are things over there?

00:24:42.444 --> 00:24:45.127
It's… fine. Why did you ask?

00:24:47.178 --> 00:24:48.611
You used the fan yesterday,

00:24:49.278 --> 00:24:51.938
so I was worried the cats would protest.

00:24:53.017 --> 00:24:54.216
Protest what?

00:24:54.644 --> 00:24:58.183
The app still says
they're all "feeling so good."

00:25:00.133 --> 00:25:02.500
(We're all gonna be "feeling good" for sure.)

00:25:04.906 --> 00:25:09.338
(Aha, the door's open?
Excuse me, I'm going to feel good outside.)

00:25:10.944 --> 00:25:12.811
Gotcha!

00:25:13.655 --> 00:25:16.322
Good try, but you're still a noob, Jiro.

00:25:16.733 --> 00:25:18.505
No wonder you've been acting all proper.

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:20.111
You had a plan all along.

00:25:22.361 --> 00:25:23.811
Jenny, don't go!

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.400
Hey, Krapor.

00:25:26.577 --> 00:25:27.510
Where are the other cats?

00:25:27.583 --> 00:25:30.205
I thought you had them blocked off.

00:25:30.383 --> 00:25:32.350
Once I opened the door,
they all dashed out.

00:25:32.417 --> 00:25:33.705
I was about to close it, but…

00:25:39.967 --> 00:25:41.550
Hey, you lured me out there on purpose?

00:25:42.822 --> 00:25:43.844
(Haven't you heard?

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.716
Even the earth is shaking,
don't mess with my AC!)

00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:47.789
Hey, Jiro!

00:25:47.883 --> 00:25:49.322
Krapor, catch him!

00:25:49.428 --> 00:25:50.428
(I'm going. Bye!)

00:25:50.522 --> 00:25:52.572
-Jiro!
-Come back in.

00:26:29.255 --> 00:26:30.738
Krapor told me everything.

00:26:34.288 --> 00:26:35.394
You didn't mean to.

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:37.088
Don't beat yourself up.

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.783
But didn't they run off
because they were mad at me?

00:26:43.756 --> 00:26:44.916
I'm still the one to blame.

00:26:49.007 --> 00:26:50.007
Meow~

00:26:50.853 --> 00:26:51.853
Meow~

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.120
Meow~

00:27:03.572 --> 00:27:05.300
All other cats have left, Granny Juu.

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:07.899
You can go too if you want.

00:27:10.578 --> 00:27:11.578
I understand you.

00:27:22.872 --> 00:27:26.022
When I was little, my mom went to work

00:27:29.244 --> 00:27:30.622
and left me home alone.

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:36.016
I only had the TV to kill my loneliness.

00:27:39.933 --> 00:27:42.505
Then one day, something rubbed
against my leg like just now.

00:27:46.617 --> 00:27:48.144
I looked down…

00:27:48.556 --> 00:27:50.144
It got abandoned.

00:27:50.283 --> 00:27:51.522
…and met a new friend.

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:53.316
Can I keep it?

00:27:55.611 --> 00:27:56.772
Please.

00:27:58.939 --> 00:28:00.133
Please.

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:01.272
Lynx, dear.

00:28:01.711 --> 00:28:04.533
Taking care of a pet isn't easy.

00:28:05.261 --> 00:28:08.200
You need to give it love and warmth
and feed it well.

00:28:08.856 --> 00:28:10.405
You might love it now.

00:28:10.556 --> 00:28:13.611
But if one day you get bored of it,
how would it live?

00:28:14.311 --> 00:28:15.505
You can't just abandon it.

00:28:19.267 --> 00:28:20.805
I won't get bored of it.

00:28:23.721 --> 00:28:25.822
Look. It's really cute.

00:28:28.367 --> 00:28:30.122
I want to keep it too.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:37.327
But I can barely take care of you properly.

00:28:38.589 --> 00:28:40.649
If I have to take care of it too—

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:42.527
I'm not asking you to raise it.

00:28:43.194 --> 00:28:45.105
I'm asking to raise it myself.

00:28:46.428 --> 00:28:47.428
Please, Mom.

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:49.211
I promise.

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:51.811
I'll take the best care of it.

00:28:57.739 --> 00:28:58.739
Please, Mom.

00:29:00.339 --> 00:29:01.811
Please.

00:29:03.456 --> 00:29:05.355
-Okay!
-Yay!

00:29:05.928 --> 00:29:07.122
I'm sorry, Granny Juu.

00:29:14.711 --> 00:29:16.644
I'm sorry I broke my promise.

00:29:17.894 --> 00:29:20.716
(Lynx, why are you crying, dear?)

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:23.722
(Who made you cry? You can tell me.)

00:29:25.389 --> 00:29:26.811
You don't need to apologize to her.

00:29:30.572 --> 00:29:31.922
Granny Juu won't go anywhere.

00:29:34.617 --> 00:29:35.916
She doesn't want to see you sad.

00:29:50.806 --> 00:29:52.411
If you want to keep your promise,

00:29:52.871 --> 00:29:56.427
let's go bring Granny Juu's family back.

00:29:57.361 --> 00:29:58.911
Do you know where to look for them?

00:30:01.477 --> 00:30:02.616
(I know.)

00:30:06.133 --> 00:30:08.916
I think I know.

00:30:15.315 --> 00:30:18.037
Cats like to hide in narrow spaces.

00:30:18.172 --> 00:30:19.688
But it varies from cat to cat.

00:30:20.144 --> 00:30:21.399
They all have different tastes.

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:23.461
They sit in everything except the cat bed.

00:30:23.511 --> 00:30:24.988
I'm gonna sell all the cat beds off.

00:30:25.478 --> 00:30:28.377
Jumbo is the youngest.

00:30:29.132 --> 00:30:30.188
He likes toys.

00:30:30.833 --> 00:30:33.122
If it's toys, I'm all ready.

00:30:33.978 --> 00:30:36.533
For Gen Alpha cats with busy parents,

00:30:37.288 --> 00:30:38.305
they like to play this.

00:30:40.078 --> 00:30:42.661
Wow. They have games for cats now?

00:30:44.178 --> 00:30:46.911
(Next is John Wick, a mysterious cat.)

00:30:46.983 --> 00:30:48.305
(No one knows his background.)

00:30:48.394 --> 00:30:49.950
(He always finds hiding spots.)

00:30:50.044 --> 00:30:51.627
(The only way to lure him out is…)

00:30:52.506 --> 00:30:53.506
What's that?

00:30:54.694 --> 00:30:55.734
(Ooh, laser!)

00:30:56.055 --> 00:30:58.744
-John Wick!
-(I despise you~)

00:31:00.389 --> 00:31:02.266
Next is Jenny.

00:31:03.022 --> 00:31:04.705
She used to belong to a beauty blogger.

00:31:05.172 --> 00:31:06.399
She's a total beauty queen.

00:31:06.922 --> 00:31:08.194
And she loves pretty boys.

00:31:09.094 --> 00:31:10.399
You should've told me sooner.

00:31:11.389 --> 00:31:12.416
Let me call Krapor.

00:31:12.806 --> 00:31:13.806
Stop.

00:31:14.772 --> 00:31:16.705
You've never seen me
in my golden form, have you?

00:31:44.183 --> 00:31:48.055
(Hello there. You looking good~)

00:31:49.261 --> 00:31:50.261
Jenny!

00:31:55.222 --> 00:31:56.811
Now it's just Jiro left.

00:31:57.394 --> 00:31:59.311
He used to live at a restaurant.

00:31:59.717 --> 00:32:01.699
He met tons of people and
knows a lot of things.

00:32:01.821 --> 00:32:03.516
He's a total boss cat of the café.

00:32:05.905 --> 00:32:07.011
What should I do?

00:32:07.794 --> 00:32:08.805
Should I post again?

00:32:09.283 --> 00:32:10.388
I already did.

00:32:13.433 --> 00:32:14.433
But I think…

00:32:14.755 --> 00:32:16.010
I've got a better idea.

00:32:17.494 --> 00:32:18.494
Hey, handsome.

00:32:19.144 --> 00:32:20.144
Handsome boy.

00:32:20.339 --> 00:32:21.339
Help me out.

00:32:22.872 --> 00:32:23.905
Have you seen Jiro?

00:32:26.206 --> 00:32:29.211
If you see him,
tell him to come home.

00:32:29.289 --> 00:32:30.327
We've forgiven him.

00:32:30.383 --> 00:32:35.599
(I'm not a radio station, but fine, I'll help.
All because you called me handsome.)

00:32:35.689 --> 00:32:36.733
Thanks, handsome.

00:32:38.522 --> 00:32:39.522
What are you doing?

00:32:41.627 --> 00:32:42.694
Haven't you heard?

00:32:43.133 --> 00:32:46.394
When a cat goes missing,
try asking the strays to help you look.

00:32:46.543 --> 00:32:47.543
You might find it.

00:32:48.511 --> 00:32:49.605
Is that really gonna work?

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:51.666
How do you know he even understands you?

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:57.516
If this doesn't work,

00:32:59.617 --> 00:33:00.900
there's one more way left.

00:33:02.439 --> 00:33:04.119
What is it? I'll do it.

00:33:04.944 --> 00:33:10.016
They say you put a pot on your head
and walk around yelling the cat's name.

00:33:11.905 --> 00:33:13.405
Yeah, you do that silly way yourself.

00:33:16.911 --> 00:33:17.911
(Found him.)

00:33:17.983 --> 00:33:19.399
(The orange dude is over there.)

00:33:19.566 --> 00:33:21.366
(Shh! Don't blow my cover!)

00:33:25.967 --> 00:33:26.967
Jiro!

00:33:31.189 --> 00:33:32.189
Jiro!

00:33:32.722 --> 00:33:33.722
Jiro!

00:33:34.306 --> 00:33:35.106
Jiro!

00:33:35.333 --> 00:33:36.477
-Jiro!
-Jiro!

00:33:37.122 --> 00:33:38.680
Jiro!

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:44.420
(Good try, but you're still a noob.)

00:33:50.259 --> 00:33:53.113
Let me take a quick break,
then we'll go find him again.

00:34:00.407 --> 00:34:01.800
How about we try again tomorrow?

00:34:03.456 --> 00:34:04.794
You've been searching all day.

00:34:14.106 --> 00:34:15.288
Don't be so hard on yourself.

00:34:18.282 --> 00:34:19.611
You already did really well.

00:34:21.894 --> 00:34:23.400
You got a bunch of them back.

00:34:31.988 --> 00:34:35.083
I'll wait down here then,
in case Jiro comes back.

00:34:42.517 --> 00:34:43.517
Then…

00:34:45.506 --> 00:34:46.783
I'll stay and keep you company.

00:34:50.222 --> 00:34:51.294
Who made you my companion?

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:56.294
I meant Jiro.

00:34:57.933 --> 00:35:00.677
He already "added" me as a friend.

00:35:03.494 --> 00:35:04.494
We did this.

00:35:20.161 --> 00:35:21.161
Here.

00:35:35.122 --> 00:35:36.711
HOPE YOU FIND YOUR MISSING CAT :)

00:35:42.077 --> 00:35:43.077
Thank you.

00:35:55.761 --> 00:35:57.311
Why do you love cats so much?

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:02.600
Are there people on this planet

00:36:03.778 --> 00:36:06.922
who don't love cats,
besides you?

00:36:09.283 --> 00:36:11.711
Others get to pat their heads,
scratch their chins,

00:36:12.989 --> 00:36:14.788
but you can only watch from afar.

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:16.805
Don't you feel bad?

00:36:19.461 --> 00:36:20.811
Why do I have to feel bad?

00:36:21.906 --> 00:36:24.411
When you love someone,

00:36:26.006 --> 00:36:27.805
don't you want something in return?

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:37.250
I think…

00:36:38.178 --> 00:36:39.394
I do get something in return.

00:36:40.072 --> 00:36:42.000
Even though I don't get to scratch their chins,

00:36:42.389 --> 00:36:43.494
rub their bellies,

00:36:44.261 --> 00:36:45.622
or brush them like other people,

00:36:47.711 --> 00:36:50.377
just seeing them eat and sleep well,

00:36:51.739 --> 00:36:53.488
seeing Jumbo cling to you with his claws,

00:36:54.955 --> 00:36:56.405
that already makes me happy.

00:36:57.927 --> 00:36:59.287
To put it simply,

00:36:59.833 --> 00:37:01.183
I'm in one-sided love with cats.

00:38:20.767 --> 00:38:22.494
HOPE YOU FIND YOUR MISSING CAT :)

00:38:23.289 --> 00:38:24.289
Lynx.

00:38:25.139 --> 00:38:26.139
Lynx!

00:38:29.839 --> 00:38:30.877
What's up, Krapor?

00:38:31.017 --> 00:38:35.116
This morning I was delivering ice in this alley
and heard dogs barking at something.

00:38:35.216 --> 00:38:36.255
Then I found this.

00:38:41.072 --> 00:38:42.192
Jiro's collar.

00:38:44.306 --> 00:38:45.511
I don't know if he's okay.

00:38:47.189 --> 00:38:50.661
(I almost didn't make it this morning.
Thanks for saving me.)

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:54.044
(I've never seen you before.
Which house did you escape from?)

00:38:54.144 --> 00:38:56.744
(I'm not a house cat. I was born a stray.)

00:38:56.828 --> 00:38:59.527
(Your face is way too shiny to be a stray.)

00:38:59.594 --> 00:39:03.405
(Go home already.
Your human is probably worried sick.)

00:39:03.711 --> 00:39:07.194
(I don't have one.
The one who worried about me is gone.)

00:39:07.633 --> 00:39:09.494
(The one who's there doesn't like me.)

00:39:10.133 --> 00:39:11.133
Jiro!

00:39:13.385 --> 00:39:14.822
Have you seen an orange cat
that looks like this?

00:39:16.189 --> 00:39:17.189
Have you?

00:39:24.039 --> 00:39:25.411
If this doesn't work,

00:39:27.494 --> 00:39:28.911
there's one more way left.

00:39:29.889 --> 00:39:31.569
What is it? I'll do it.

00:39:32.517 --> 00:39:37.511
They say you put a pot on your head
and walk around yelling the cat's name.

00:39:39.322 --> 00:39:40.816
Yeah, you do that silly way yourself.

00:39:45.133 --> 00:39:47.822
Jiro! Let's go home.

00:39:49.561 --> 00:39:50.561
Jiro!

00:39:51.417 --> 00:39:52.722
Jiro, come out already.

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:55.550
Jiro!

00:39:59.133 --> 00:40:00.133
Jiro!

00:40:02.887 --> 00:40:03.687
Jiro.

00:40:03.772 --> 00:40:06.039
Look, he keeps calling Jiro, Jiro.

00:40:10.056 --> 00:40:11.094
What are you laughing at?

00:40:11.467 --> 00:40:12.500
Is it that funny?

00:40:14.128 --> 00:40:15.128
Jiro.

00:40:15.933 --> 00:40:17.205
Jiro, let's go home.

00:40:17.722 --> 00:40:21.411
(Ugh… people still believe this kind of myth?)

00:40:21.644 --> 00:40:25.172
(Why not just post online
instead of wasting time like this?)

00:40:25.299 --> 00:40:26.710
(It doesn't work.)

00:40:28.011 --> 00:40:29.505
(No, it does work.)

00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:30.950
Jiro.

00:40:33.539 --> 00:40:34.539
Jiro!

00:40:35.989 --> 00:40:36.989
Jiro.

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:38.140
Meow~

00:40:38.507 --> 00:40:39.507
Meow~

00:40:40.953 --> 00:40:41.953
Meow~

00:40:44.233 --> 00:40:45.233
Jiro!

00:40:48.988 --> 00:40:50.116
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:40:51.139 --> 00:40:52.139
Hm?

00:41:34.827 --> 00:41:35.900
It's yummy, isn't it?

00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:39.113
I believe you now.
Not all cat food is the same.

00:41:42.167 --> 00:41:43.220
Eat up, everyone.

00:41:46.833 --> 00:41:48.602
So you'll be strong
and stay with me for a long time.

00:41:57.311 --> 00:41:58.322
Granny Juu.

00:41:59.432 --> 00:42:01.021
I wasn't planning on keeping the café.

00:42:03.236 --> 00:42:05.194
But seeing you all miss Mom too,

00:42:08.406 --> 00:42:10.086
I wanted to keep going.

00:42:13.683 --> 00:42:14.798
Even so…

00:42:18.592 --> 00:42:20.808
I overlooked how you would feel.

00:42:28.743 --> 00:42:29.743
I'm sorry.

00:42:31.726 --> 00:42:33.920
From now on, I promise.

00:42:37.058 --> 00:42:38.708
I'll take the best care of you all.

00:42:39.497 --> 00:42:40.796
I'll use the same brand of food,

00:42:43.053 --> 00:42:44.086
the same litter,

00:42:45.493 --> 00:42:47.443
do everything the way Mom did.

00:42:55.584 --> 00:42:57.497
Can you all give me one more chance?

00:43:09.382 --> 00:43:10.382
Just once more.

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:11.653
(So, kids.)

00:43:12.449 --> 00:43:13.812
(Will you trust Lynx again?)

00:44:01.272 --> 00:44:04.530
Jenny, this evening we've got a reservation
from a group of football boys.

00:44:05.118 --> 00:44:06.306
Work your charm, okay?

00:44:08.351 --> 00:44:09.351
Deal?

00:44:10.603 --> 00:44:11.603
John Wick,

00:44:11.942 --> 00:44:15.222
if any customer gets loud,
give them your death stare.

00:44:19.189 --> 00:44:21.710
Jiro, today's the first day
I'm making Meow Meow Rice.

00:44:21.786 --> 00:44:22.842
It might be a little slow,

00:44:23.398 --> 00:44:26.414
so if any customer gets hungry,
go play with them and buy me some time.

00:44:27.464 --> 00:44:28.464
Okay?

00:44:28.958 --> 00:44:30.022
And Granny Juu,

00:44:32.544 --> 00:44:33.841
wish me luck.

00:44:52.004 --> 00:44:53.004
Granny Juu.

00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:55.410
Who do you think will be
our first customer today?

00:44:56.431 --> 00:44:57.805
Cat-Cheer Café, wel—

00:45:13.374 --> 00:45:14.374
You again.

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:16.410
Don't you have anything better to do?

00:45:19.059 --> 00:45:21.003
Granny, this one doesn't count.

00:45:21.526 --> 00:45:23.416
He's the creditor, not our customer.

00:45:33.868 --> 00:45:37.708
The café owner's washing dishes himself?

00:45:39.948 --> 00:45:40.948
I told you, didn't I?

00:45:41.121 --> 00:45:42.992
I can handle this place on my own just fine.

00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:56.460
Pick it up for me.

00:45:59.224 --> 00:46:00.224
Come on.

00:46:08.255 --> 00:46:09.673
Cat-Cheer Café, how may I help you?

00:46:11.195 --> 00:46:13.927
Chin, table for four at 4 PM?

00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:15.630
Got it.

00:46:16.357 --> 00:46:17.357
Thank you.

00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:31.190
Fine.

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:32.782
I do need help,

00:46:33.370 --> 00:46:35.503
but I don't even have money
to pay you back right now.

00:46:37.022 --> 00:46:40.076
Then let me help you.

00:46:42.079 --> 00:46:43.112
I won't charge you.

00:46:45.544 --> 00:46:46.600
Are you that free?

00:46:47.242 --> 00:46:48.443
Go mess around somewhere else.

00:46:48.788 --> 00:46:52.201
I'm not messing around. I'm serious.

00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:55.127
You know I love cats,

00:46:55.679 --> 00:46:56.725
but I'm allergic to them.

00:46:57.954 --> 00:47:00.287
The only place I can get my cat fix

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:01.800
is here.

00:47:03.426 --> 00:47:05.296
But I can't just take free labor from you.

00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:11.270
Then…

00:47:12.077 --> 00:47:13.081
I've got a proposal.

00:47:14.931 --> 00:47:15.931
What?

00:47:16.726 --> 00:47:18.178
I help you run this café,

00:47:19.232 --> 00:47:20.687
and in return, I get to be the cats' dad.

00:47:21.923 --> 00:47:23.428
Anything about them,

00:47:24.579 --> 00:47:25.604
you must ask me.

00:47:26.287 --> 00:47:27.415
If you're their dad,

00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:29.116
who am I to them?

00:47:30.783 --> 00:47:31.783
The cats' papa.

00:47:33.156 --> 00:47:35.031
Nah, they're all yours.

00:47:39.694 --> 00:47:42.508
Wash the dishes, not your face.

00:47:45.602 --> 00:47:46.602
Where?

00:47:47.172 --> 00:47:48.172
On your nose.

00:47:50.072 --> 00:47:51.072
No, right here.

00:47:52.018 --> 00:47:52.828
Where?

00:47:52.997 --> 00:47:53.997
Your nose.

00:47:55.273 --> 00:47:56.273
Ugh!

00:48:03.924 --> 00:48:06.222
(My name is Tiger.
I have allergic reactions to cats.)

00:48:07.793 --> 00:48:11.020
(And today… my heart is having a reaction to another cat.)

00:48:12.148 --> 00:48:13.810
(I just hope with this cat…)

00:48:13.963 --> 00:48:17.099
(it won't be one-sided love like all the others.)

00:48:33.318 --> 00:48:35.988
(Next Episode)
I'm the new staff. Please give me advice, Mr. Lynx.

00:48:36.171 --> 00:48:37.583
-Ouch!
-Lynx! You okay?

00:48:38.144 --> 00:48:40.125
Do you know cats copy their owners?

00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:43.212
I want to see if cats really copy their owners.

00:48:43.739 --> 00:48:45.871
My mom used to make me come here a few times.

00:48:46.077 --> 00:48:48.602
Then I stopped coming. Uncle Vet here is scary.

00:48:48.663 --> 00:48:50.515
Not just cats, even I'm scared.

00:48:50.883 --> 00:48:53.811
Here, if the cats behave, the vet won't be harsh with them.

00:48:54.116 --> 00:48:55.523
Hey, Dr. Pom.

00:48:55.770 --> 00:48:56.770
Who is he?
