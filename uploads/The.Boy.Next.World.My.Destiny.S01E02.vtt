WEBVTT

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:02.940
Get some rest for now.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.970
An ordinary person living an ordinary life.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.840
I always knew that's who I was.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.240
And I figured

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.330
love just wasn't in the cards for me.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.160
It was a little lonely,

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.360
but also a relief.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.550
Until someone suddenly came knocking.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.020
Fuu.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.490
I'm so glad you're okay.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.890
My lover...

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.950
from a parallel world.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.470
Or at least, that's who he claimed to be.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.200
Fuu. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.240
You and I are dating.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.540
Wait, what?

00:01:59.541 --> 00:02:01.720
We're a couple.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.150
Um...

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.070
I'm sorry, but...

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.630
I'm not really good at
reacting to surprises.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.530
In that case...

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.410
can we start over?

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:21.710
Huh?

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.840
I didn't mean to scare you,

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.510
or make you feel uncomfortable.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.200
But...

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.440
I can't just let this go.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:37.950
Let me court you.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.440
Please let me pursue you,

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.990
to make you my boyfriend.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.910
I don't even know how to act around him.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.910
Another one of my favorite foods.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.820
How does he know all this?

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.680
It's seemed like everything
turned upside down that day.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.700
"The Boy Next World My Destiny"
(Episode 2)

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.610
Morning, Fuu.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.270
Oh, I thought you were Sara.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.060
Sara?

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.090
You mean Sara Kogami?

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.280
Yeah, I've been seeing
him everywhere lately.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.980
I saw him thirty times yesterday alone.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.200
And we're not even in the same grade.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.350
Jin says I just never noticed him before,

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.900
but that's definitely not it.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.290
Something is definitely weird.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.270
Fuu, do you not want to see him?

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.310
It's not that...

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.846
What's there to complain
about having a hot guy like you?

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.909
No, someone as dazzling as him

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.640
would never like someone like me.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.100
That's why it's so scary.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.050
Wait.

00:05:27.051 --> 00:05:28.710
What do you mean, "someone like me"?

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.660
Fuu, you're adorable.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:34.690
Lucky color.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.940
Lucky charm.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.730
Lucky number.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.310
I followed my horoscope to a T.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.040
So why is this happening to me?

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.340
Hello?

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:57.900
Fuu.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.380
Where are you right now?

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:01.750
Sara?

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:05.780
Is something wrong?

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:07.570
I have class in a bit.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:10.890
I just wanted to see you.

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:13.170
Fuu.

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.370
Sorry for calling out of the blue.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:21.740
Good luck in class.

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:32.690
Morn...

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.200
- Morning.
- Morning.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.050
What the heck, Fuu? Are you ignoring me?

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.680
Good morning.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:45.510
What's up?

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.920
Sara again?

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.500
Yeah.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.170
I was wondering... are we really a couple?

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.310
Huh?

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.290
Oh, no, no, that's not what I meant.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.420
Not us.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.740
I mean the Fuu and Sara
in the parallel world.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.090
Parallel world?

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:05.540
Yeah, you know.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.430
Like that trope in movies.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.220
Like an alternate universe.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:54.330
Knock, knock...

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:55.740
Anyone there?

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:19.280
Please let me borrow an umbrella again.

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:21.180
I promise I'll return it.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.160
My luck really has been terrible lately.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:07.920
Sara?

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.970
You catch cold easily if you get wet, Fuu.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.760
How do you know that?

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.120
I'll be going now.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:22.710
Wait.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:30.830
I need to talk to you.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.540
Can you do one thing for me?

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:45.050
What is it?

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:47.650
Stop using that personal pronoun.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.820
I want you to refer to yourself as "Fuu."

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:52.130
Why?

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.159
If I guess this passcode correctly,

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.480
I want you to call yourself "Fuu."

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.060
Deal?

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:07.420
Um...

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:09.120
One day, you'll definitely say it.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:10.980
You'll call yourself "Fuu."

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:16.690
Doing stuff like this...

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.620
Don't you think it might scare me?

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:24.820
I'm sorry.

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:33.150
I just can't help myself with you.

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:44.840
It's your father's birthday.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Right?

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:02.230
Sit down. We need to
get some things straight.

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.410
I've been wanting to do this.

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:14.290
When I woke up,

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.040
I even wondered if
something was wrong with me.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.300
Suddenly being told we weren't even dating.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:28.170
That's why

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:30.530
I came here that night.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.590
I didn't mean to frighten you.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.640
But... (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:48.270
I didn't know how else to make
you believe we were together.

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:06.270
You're soaking wet.

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:10.070
Are you worried about me?

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:14.429
Even if we aren't dating,

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:16.060
I'd still be worried.

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:24.960
In that other world,

00:12:24.961 --> 00:12:26.220
when did we start dating?

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.940
In your freshman year.

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:31.610
On the day of the sports meet.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.089
Should I not answer?

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:41.090
Go ahead.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:44.830
- But...
- It's really okay.

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:01.010
Taiga?

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:02.580
Sara.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:04.150
They want you to come back.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:05.977
No.

00:13:06.204 --> 00:13:07.760
I'm definitely not going back.

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:09.650
Seriously...

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:11.920
That Taiga you mentioned,

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:13.170
do you mean Taiga from school?

00:13:16.149 --> 00:13:17.189
(Incoming Call from Taiga)

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:20.790
That guy actually hung up on me...!

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:27.830
I'm sorry.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.470
He says he has no intention of coming back.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:35.040
Mr. Kogami was supposed
to be on bed rest until today.

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:36.716
It's common for patients
to experience confusion

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:38.900
or memory distortion.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.760
Um...

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.920
Is Sara going to be okay like this?

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.979
Well, if he's not showing any symptoms now,

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:49.630
he should be fine.

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:51.290
I see...

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.190
Anyway, the hospital is no longer liable.

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:57.610
Please settle the bill
at the first-floor counter.

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.990
The bill...?

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.160
Wait.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:07.000
Why do I have to be the one to pay?

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:17.130
Oh, I forgot.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:18.690
The laundry.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.560
Let me help.

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:25.570
Oh, I can do it myself!

00:14:25.942 --> 00:14:27.540
Seriously, it's fine!

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.500
Just leave it to me...

00:14:28.501 --> 00:14:30.010
No, that's not what I meant!

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:32.479
- It's okay.
- Don't look! I told you I've got it!

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.480
Wait a second...

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:35.460
Sara.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Give it back.

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:07.650
Fuu.

00:15:08.872 --> 00:15:10.912
If you don't move, don't
blame me for what happens.

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:37.070
Um...

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:40.150
I'm... going to the bathroom.

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:16.770
A paper cup phone.

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:20.510
Knock, knock...

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:29.450
This is how we first met.

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:33.250
Knock, knock...

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:35.720
Freshman calling a senior.

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:37.550
If you hear me, give me a signal.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:41.060
Huh?

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:47.660
If you want it back,

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:49.510
guess who I am.

00:16:52.203 --> 00:16:53.833
No, there was nobody there back then...

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:58.070
Oh, I see.

00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:59.970
It was different in that world.

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:02.910
Because in my world...

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:04.480
you never answered me.

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.440
The "me" in this world is such an idiot.

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:13.949
The person on the other
end of the cup phone...

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:15.190
It was you, wasn't it?

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:28.140
I know we're nothing to each other here.

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:33.220
But can I stay by your side?

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:45.450
I guess.

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:47.930
And you're allowed to pat my head, too.

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:57.190
Is this okay too?

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:01.390
Don't push your luck.

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:03.080
Please go home.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.240
I am home.

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:09.830
I live right downstairs.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:14.880
What!?

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:29.950
Sara.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:36.380
Are you really not
going to tell Fuu anything?

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:41.580
What do you mean by that?

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.480
Nothing. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:45.650
I just think there's more
to this than meets the eye.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:50.060
There isn't.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:54.590
Well... it's your choice, I guess.

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:11.730
So soft.

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:20.090
Idiot!

00:19:20.435 --> 00:19:21.660
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:24.160
It's not me he likes.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.550
It's the Fuu from the other world.

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:29.790
Don't let your heart flutter.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.370
Control yourself, Fuu.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:56.740
I can't.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.000
That face is just unfair.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.690
Hey, you're overthinking it.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.240
Jin.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.380
What?

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:32.840
Did you just read my mind?

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:36.940
No, you said all of that out loud.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:43.980
Oh.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:45.920
Anyway, I've decided.

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:50.410
I'm going to find a way to send him back.

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:56.740
But don't you like him?

00:20:58.910 --> 00:20:59.910
I do not.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.340
My heart just skipped a beat, that's all.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:06.980
I refuse to be the one who tears him away
from the Fuu in his world.

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:07.940
Fuu...

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:09.580
My mind is made up.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.520
I'm going to find a way to send him home.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.240
Man.

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:28.400
This is going to get complicated.

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:35.980
What triggered him coming here...?

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:38.790
No.

00:21:38.791 --> 00:21:40.870
Maybe a psychic or a
shrine would have a clue...

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:49.950
Watch out!

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:00.670
Why is...

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.070
my heart beating so fast?

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:06.220
What am I supposed to do?

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:08.640
Fuu! Are you hurt?

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:12.340
Are you okay?

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:15.390
I'd already decided to send him back.

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:19.310
But this man...

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:22.580
is starting to change my whole world.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:08.700
Knock, knock...

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:12.700
Ah.
