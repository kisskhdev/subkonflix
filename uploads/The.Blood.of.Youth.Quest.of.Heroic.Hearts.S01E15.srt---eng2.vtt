Xiaohua. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.960
I'm glad you're safe.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:38.680
Where is Ye Zhixin?

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.120
He saved me.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.750
But one moment later,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.310
he vanished.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.430
Ye Zhixin

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.590
always comes and goes like that.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.400
How do you feel now?

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:56.400
Much better.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.150
Thankfully, Hua Xiaohua

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.680
gave you the Wanling Pill.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.750
Otherwise,

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:04.960
you would've died.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.630
Xiaohua.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.520
The master in the corridor gave you the Wanling Pill to save yourself.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.280
Why would you use it on me?

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.400
Don't worry.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:14.800
Whether it was used on you

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.590
or me makes no difference.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.520
Stop it, you two.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.910
Let's find a way

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:25.710
to get out of here.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.080
Where are the peach blossom trees?

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.430
I knew those trees were weird.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.750
It must be a Peach Blossom Array.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.520
So many peach blossom trees.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.240
It must be a Peach Blossom Array.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.470
If this is an array,

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.240
there must be a center.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.000
Which tree is the array center?

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:18.310
This is...

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.920
I must have touched the array center.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.360
That's why the array disappeared.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.750
So, I found the array center.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.070
What's with your finger?

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.120
Are you hurt?

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.000
I'm fine.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.480
Let's go.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.950
Let's go.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.430
Come.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:34.360
Careful.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.310
Come. Be careful.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.560
What is going on?

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.630
Why does my head hurt so much?

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.830
Could it be...

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:58.720
Whatever.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.950
Xiaohua!

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.430
Xiaohua.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.390
Knock before you enter a lady's chamber.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.240
We are friends who've been through life and death.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:24.680
We don't need the formalities.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:31.750
I'll take note of it.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.190
Are you all right?

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.240
Do you feel unwell?

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.240
I'm fine.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.310
It's just a headache.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.950
I took some medicine.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:42.830
It should go away in a while.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.160
Anyway, why are you here?

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.830
I heard there's a festival in town.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.720
It's very lively.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.680
Do you want to go?

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.510
Really?

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:56.630
Is Weigui coming?

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.310
If I invite him,

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.390
he'll definitely come.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.920
Let's go, then.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.160
Let's go.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.070
Miss,

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:08.360
buy a flower.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.070
I plucked them this morning.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:11.600
Pick a flower.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.070
This is the most festive celebration of Pingchuan Town.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.630
I've heard about it before,

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.630
and I can't believe that I came just in time

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.920
to participate in person.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.240
Don't you travel all the time?

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.160
I thought

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.360
you were used to a carefree life.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:26.830
I did travel a lot.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.800
But I was also busy making medicine and money.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.390
I didn't have time for this.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.040
Me too.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.000
I've always lived

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.680
in Lei's Stronghold.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:33.680
It's my

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:34.720
first time

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.560
attending a celebration

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.870
with my friends too.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.390
In that case,

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.720
let's cast aside our preoccupations

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.800
and enjoy ourselves.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.360
Sure.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:44.040
Cheers.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.120
Cheers.

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:46.750
Cheers.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.190
Come take a look!

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:55.800
- A game of cuju! - Look at my flowers.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.630
- Many prizes to win! - Take a look.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.190
- Come take a look. - I plucked them this morning.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.430
A game of Cuju.

Gentlemen. (Support Admin Watch on

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.040
Just stand there

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:03.510
and toss the ball into the basket.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.070
You can pick

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:05.720
any prize you want.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.560
What an interesting game.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.190
- Come. - Here.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.160
Check this out.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.270
It's going to be

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:15.240
easy.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.000
Didn't I say I had a plan and tell you

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.950
not to act on your own?

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.510
Is my order not an order anymore?

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:26.870
I did this

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.120
for you.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.120
If you do not make the decision now,

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.070
your health will...

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:33.600
My health is none of your concern.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:36.630
Sect Leader,

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.750
you cannot let your kindness sway you further.

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.430
Hua Xiaohua is now afflicted

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.870
with Peach Blossom Stupor.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.750
If they know the truth,

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.510
they'll become your enemies.

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:54.830
I know.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.040
Stand up.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:02.720
At this point,

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.190
there is no need to hide it from you.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.270
I was the one

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.160
who killed

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:11.270
Weigui's family back then.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:13.630
You?

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:16.920
Why?

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:18.560
They could neither hand Xiao Se over

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:20.600
nor have a way to cure you.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:21.600
What was the point

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.040
of keeping them alive?

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:24.950
Besides,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.830
if news of your ailment

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:27.720
goes out,

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.510
another conflict

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:31.240
will fall upon Tianwaitian.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.080
So, I had

00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:35.480
to eradicate all potential problems.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:39.870
Sect Leader,

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:42.360
you cannot be friends with them.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.030
Do not

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.510
show mercy anymore.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.670
Prioritize your health.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.480
You're dismissed.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.480
Yes.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.120
Not too shabby.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.550
Watch me.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.840
Miss, do you want some flowers?

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:33.440
Impressive, isn't it?

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.080
It's so beautiful.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.150
Not only is it beautiful,

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:38.240
but it also has a special meaning.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.000
If you give the flower to your lover

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.390
during the festival,

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.030
both of you will be together

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.000
forever.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.080
Lover?

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:53.200
Come. Again.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:09:59.720
Then,

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:00.790
I'll take one.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:01.600
Sure.
