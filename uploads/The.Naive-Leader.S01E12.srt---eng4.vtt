WEBVTT

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.070
Brother Fan

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.760
Brother Fan

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.230
You guys aren't dead?

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.310
You're the one who's dead, you bastard.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.150
It's not that easy to kill us off.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.920
You guys go up and call Big Brother out.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.150
Let's get out of this hellhole together.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.920
Wait a minute.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.510
Never mind the risk if we get caught,

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.200
Big Brother definitely won't leave.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.150
Then you guys just trick him into coming out.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.760
Tie him up and drag him along if you have to.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.790
Go, hurry.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.480
Alright, alright.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.480
Hurry up!

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.520
Since you're back,

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.680
why don't you come inside?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.870
Ma the Tigress.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.520
These stairs are so steep.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.030
I'm exhausted.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.120
Just resting a bit.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.280
Ma the Tigress...

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.360
I brought Scarface back to you.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.430
He is your right-hand man, after all.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.030
If he were to die out there,

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.240
word would spread that you're disloyal.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.470
It's good that you're back safe.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.680
For the next couple of days,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.030
you don't have to do any work.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:52.630
Just rest up.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.560
Let's go.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:00.400
Let's go.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.910
Let's go.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.520
Slow down, slow down.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.590
Boss Xiu Gu, business is booming.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.560
It's your Commander Qin whose business is booming.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.280
This is the Huo Family residence.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.590
Don't you recognize it?

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.080
Sitting here blocking the door.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.560
Sorry about that.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.000
I'm waiting for someone here.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.240
Sorry.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.120
Are you waiting for our Young Master?

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:47.590
No.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.520
Our Huo Family, in this town,

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.360
is one of the most prominent families.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:53.310
Who are you waiting for?

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.310
Tell me.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.590
Maybe I know them.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.240
I'm waiting for the boss across the street.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.870
Uncle Dong.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.190
Isn't there a Boss Fan across the street?

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.870
Oh, Boss Fan.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.120
Yes.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.030
You are...

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.400
I'm his wife.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.590
You are Boss Fan's wife?

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.560
Our Young Master and Boss Fan,

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.590
have a very good relationship.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.280
They are sworn brothers.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.710
Then do you know,

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:23.000
where he has gone now?

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.720
Come inside and have some tea first.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.510
When our Young Master Huo returns in a bit,

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.750
he should know where Boss Fan is.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:31.630
Let's go.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.000
Later when Boss Fan comes back,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.240
and tells our Young Master Huo,

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.630
that we didn't treat you well...

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.070
Why is it less each time?

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.430
Can't you see for yourself?

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.600
Then I'll impose on you.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.120
Please.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.160
I advise you one thing.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.430
Work hard for Commander Qin.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:45.800
Opposing him,

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.190
won't end well.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.040
Officer.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.240
Officer, Officer.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.160
Don't worry about this.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.270
We will definitely for Commander Qin,

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.800
do our work properly.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.310
You saw it too.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.430
Business is hard to do.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.600
But these accounts,

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.190
are absolutely real.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.360
We were ambushed by government troops this time.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.950
Brothers, you've worked hard.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.800
Come, drink a bowl.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.510
Boss Ma, you've worked hard.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.830
Cheers, cheers.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.070
The world is cold and fickle.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.870
We try to make a living for ourselves,

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.070
but the troops try to exterminate us.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.510
We and the troops are sworn enemies.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.950
Have another bowl.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.950
Sworn enemies!

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.510
Cheers.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:31.560
Scarface.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.120
You served well in protecting me this time.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:34.750
Reward: one roast chicken.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.240
Advisor Fan.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.830
Saving Scarface is merit upon merit.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:45.630
Also rewarded with a roast chicken.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.630
I dare not accept.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.600
Good.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.360
This meal is to calm everyone's nerves.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.190
Eat and drink your fill, regain your might.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.600
Dig in.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.630
Why did you come back again?

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.070
Ma Gang, Ma Gang.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.070
Ma Gang, Ma Gang.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.950
Rise up, rise up.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.430
United in heart and effort.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.160
Create glory again.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.600
Ma Gang, Ma Gang.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.160
Rise up, rise up.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:39.830
United in heart and effort.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Create glory again.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.950
Good.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.190
Come, brothers, let's have a drink.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.390
Come, cheers, come.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:58.920
Where is that woman from just now?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.830
Which woman?

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.270
I saw you take her inside.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.120
Do you think our Young Master Huo

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.950
only associates with you?

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.160
What of it?

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.310
Regretting it now?

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.160
It's too late.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:13.190
Mrs. Fan!

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:14.390
Mrs. Fan, come out quickly!

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:15.360
Shut your mouth!

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.510
Xiu Gu.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.480
What do you think you're doing?

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.830
Uncle Dong, control your daughter.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:22.600
All right, all right.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.680
Don't think just because Commander Qin protects you now,

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.600
that I can't sue you for trespassing on a private residence

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:27.870
and drag you to the authorities.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.000
I know, I know.

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.160
You damn girl, are you crazy?

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:32.830
Go home.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.920
Mrs. Fan.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.190
We're going back.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.390
Mrs. Fan.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.750
I didn't know you would be gracing us with your presence today,

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.750
so I've only prepared a simple meal.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.560
Please fill your stomach first.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.390
Later,

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:49.630
our Young Master

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.190
will host a proper welcome banquet for you.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:52.630
Thank you.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.950
But right now,

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:54.800
I just want to quickly see

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.120
the Boss Fan you mentioned.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.480
So this is Mrs. Fan?

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.190
Boss Fan

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:04.870
is truly a lucky man.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:07.830
My surname is Huo.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.800
I am a business partner of Boss Fan.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.510
Young Master Huo.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:12.560
To tell you the truth,

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.950
Boss Fan was doing business here,

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:16.480
but he was set up by villains

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.310
and offended the local Commander Qin.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.190
He is currently out laying low.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.000
Then do you know

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.160
exactly where he is right now?

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.390
I am also sending people to look for him.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.070
Since that is the case,

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.630
I won't trouble you any longer.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.120
I will go find him myself.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.240
You are a stranger to this place;

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.600
where would you even look?

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.510
You should just stay here with peace of mind.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.720
As soon as there is news,

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.440
I will send someone to notify you.

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:52.750
Besides,

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.960
if Commander Qin finds out

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.030
that you are Boss Fan's wife,

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:59.480
I fear it could lead to a fatal disaster.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.360
What kind of trouble did he get into?

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.030
Well,

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.720
it's a long story.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.150
Have men wait outside.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.360
Try to satisfy all of Mrs. Fan's needs.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:13.720
Young Master Huo,

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.720
please don't stand on ceremony with me.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.600
Given my friendship with Boss Fan,

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.910
you can completely treat this place as your own home.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.720
Have a good meal first.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:24.790
I have matters to attend to, so I'll take my leave.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.120
Young Master Huo!

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:30.360
There's no need for all this trouble.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.600
What are you doing?

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.270
Bandits have been rampant lately.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.630
This is to protect your safety, Mrs. Fan.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:48.000
Why are you locking the door?

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.150
Young Master Huo, Young Master Huo...

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.600
Never mind the adjutant coming to audit,

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.750
even if Commander Qin came with an abacus,

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.720
he wouldn't find a thing.

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:13.790
You don't care about your old man

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.000
stealing meat from a wolf's mouth,

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.080
but you worry about a woman you don't even know.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.910
If you're so capable,

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:23.320
then go save her.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:24.150
You're right.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.390
That's exactly what I plan to do.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.390
Don't be crazy.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.080
Haven't you always

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.150
wanted to draw a line with the Huo family

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:35.510
and never deal with them again?

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.480
Brother Fan saved me from in there.

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:40.750
Now his wife has been tricked into going there.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:42.200
I can't just ignore it.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.000
Young Master Huo is just using his wife to threaten him.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:48.320
He won't do anything to his wife.

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:50.550
If that Huo guy can't find Brother Fan,

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.080
and wants to vent his anger?

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.750
Brother Fan promised me

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.870
he would tell his wife about us.

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:03.790
As long as she agrees,

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:06.150
he will marry me.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:08.550
What?

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:12.000
You're willing to be a concubine?

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:18.080
If you truly want to marry him,

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.960
then don't save that woman.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.240
It'll make room for you.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:23.870
Dad.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.750
The state I was in when I left the Huo house,

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.240
it's not like you didn't see it.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.440
Okay, okay, okay.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.320
Alright, alright, alright.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.550
About that matter,

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:32.600
I was wrong.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.200
I... I know.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:36.910
Don't bring it up anymore.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.030
I'm not blaming you.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.870
But when I was in there,

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.790
I still had you and Brother Fan.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.270
I still had hope.

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:58.440
But who can she count on now?

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.790
You really want to go save her?

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:10.200
Fine.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.870
Then promise me,

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.750
you'll listen to me for everything.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:16.510
This is my own business.

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:17.870
You don't need to come with me.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.360
Your business is my business.

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:23.550
Promise me you'll listen to me.

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:25.240
Okay.

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:26.510
I promise.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.440
Wait until dark.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.270
Everyone agreed to leave together.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.440
Sure, sure.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.600
Big Brother won't agree to it.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:48.910
He is Big Brother.

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:50.360
How dare we lay a hand on him?

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:51.870
The problem is he's so huge.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.480
How can we beat him?

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:55.550
Desperate times

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.870
call for desperate measures.

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:00.870
What if Big Brother blames me?

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.720
When the time comes,

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.030
the four of you hit him together.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:07.200
Then he won't know who hit him.

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:08.390
True.

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:25.480
It's rare to see you so relaxed, Young Master.

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:28.030
Joy refreshes the spirit.

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:31.510
Such a beautiful night.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.510
Young Master, don't let it go to waste.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.480
A heartbroken woman...

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.200
...needs comfort the most.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.270
Uncle Xiao.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.440
How come I never noticed before?

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.120
That heart of yours...

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.550
...is a bit filthy.

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:53.000
Am I the kind of person who takes advantage of others?

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:55.790
Of course not, Young Master.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.150
But Xiu Gu followed that Fan guy...

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:01.030
I feel...

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:04.750
...it's only fair.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.240
She traveled a thousand miles to find her husband.

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:12.630
Only to find out her man became a bandit.

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:14.360
I'm just a businessman.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.150
How would I know where bandits are?

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.000
For this kind of thing...

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.320
...she has to go find Commander Qin.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.200
I get it.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:26.510
First thing tomorrow morning...

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.960
...send her over to Commander Qin.

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:29.440
That guy...

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:30.630
...when he sees a woman...

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.750
...he drools enough to bruise his feet.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.200
We are kind-hearted.

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:36.750
Helping her find her man.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.600
As for what happens after she finds him...

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.870
...whatever happens...

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.080
...has nothing to do with us.

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:44.270
You really think of everything, Young Master.

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:50.270
Careful.

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:54.870
See that?

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:56.750
When we were digging...

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.510
...I told Xuanjizi...

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.030
...there's a ready-made tunnel under the Huo residence.

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:06.150
He just wouldn't listen.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:08.550
To prove I was right...

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:11.960
...I kept digging in my original direction.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.960
And I actually dug through.

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:18.750
Remember this.

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:21.000
Never try to be a hero.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.000
And don't act on impulse.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:23.960
Got it.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.510
From now on...

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:29.600
...listen to everything I say.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.720
You called me back? Let's keep drinking!

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:41.000
Didn't you ask me...

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.320
...why I came back?

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:45.910
I came back mainly to say goodbye to you.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.440
Goodbye?

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:49.750
You don't want to leave.

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:51.600
And I don't want to stay here.

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:54.000
Fine, to each their own.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:57.080
We are brothers.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.120
Brothers for life.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.390
I'll count one, two, three.

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:02.550
We down a bowl.

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:03.120
Okay.

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:05.480
One, two, three.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.360
Cheers.

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:20.870
There's something...

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:23.200
...I've always wanted to tell you.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:24.270
Say it.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:28.790
Let's drink a bowl to build up courage.

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.750
Okay.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:31.790
One.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:32.840
Two.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.750
Three.

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:34.790
Cheers.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.150
That thing is...

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:43.550
...you are so tall.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:48.600
I...

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.630
...have one more thing to tell you.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:52.720
Say it.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.910
Uncle Xiao, bring a bucket of water.

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:01.510
Not sleeping in the middle of the night.

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:05.150
Go back. Let's rethink this.

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:10.590
He left, right?

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:11.480
Go up.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.830
Go up where?

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.440
I was locked upstairs last time.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:29.880
There are guards.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:30.920
Retreat.

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:32.070
Let's rethink this.

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:34.160
Just one person, easy to deal with.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.920
Go back.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.720
Xiu Gu, go back.

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:49.070
You've said eight sentences already.

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:50.750
How much more do you have?

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:52.720
Can't you finish it all at once?

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.920
Alright.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.160
The last sentence.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.880
I'll count one, two, three.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:17:59.590
Okay.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.640
One, two, three.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.510
I know

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.830
what you're planning with him.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.030
But I didn't expect

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.880
that the four of you

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.510
would follow them too.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:31.350
I expected even less

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.680
that you would be the leader.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.270
Ma the Tigress is ruthless.

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:38.240
She'll stop at nothing to get what she wants.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.510
She's temperamental.

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:41.270
We all live in constant fear.

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:43.070
Brother Scarface barely escaped with his life.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.510
He is a warning to us all.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.440
Most importantly,

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:48.680
you'll never be her husband

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:49.750
or rise to power.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:51.000
How can our lives as brothers

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.680
possibly be carefree and happy?

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.830
Why don't the two of us just leave?

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:12.920
Big Brother,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.350
no key.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.790
Retreat. Let's rethink this.

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:46.240
Keep it down.

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:51.350
Who?

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:52.720
Who is it?

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.960
Mrs. Fan,

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.400
we're here to rescue you.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:05.590
Mrs. Fan.

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:07.960
You are...

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:08.960
I am Xiu Gu,

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:10.920
Brother Fan's friend.

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:12.640
My name is Yu Zhen.

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:13.440
Sister Yu Zhen.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.550
That Young Master Huo isn't a good person.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.830
Come with us.

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.510
That Young Master Huo said

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.110
he was sworn brothers with my husband,

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.000
but he locked me up here.

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:26.750
Now you say you're my husband's friend.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.000
I don't know

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.270
where you want to take me.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:30.880
How can I trust you?

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:33.720
She doesn't trust you.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:34.920
She won't go with you.

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:36.790
Retreat. Let's rethink this.

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:40.550
Brother Fan said

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:42.440
you're prone to boils.

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:45.160
Sister Yu Zhen, come with us.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:45.880
Someone fainted!

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:46.880
Help!

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:47.590
Help!

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:48.920
Come with us. Hurry!

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.160
Help! Someone come quick!

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:54.640
This way.

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:00.790
Quick! Quick! Chase them! Chase them!

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:01.750
Go!

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:05.510
Quick!

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:11.790
Hurry up! Hurry!

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.160
Turn left!

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:29.160
Go, go, go!

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.070
Chase them!

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.110
Stop! Stop!

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:37.400
Chase them!

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.640
Go!

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:40.030
Stop right there!

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:41.590
Run!

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:42.750
Where do you think you're going?

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:44.480
Stop!

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:45.790
Stop!

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.960
Stop!

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.200
Stop!

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.200
Stop right there!

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.400
Stop! Stop!

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.680
You'll never get away!

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.640
How come it's you?

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.070
After him!

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:21.640
Hurry up!

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.400
Uncle Dong.

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:31.830
You have disappointed me greatly.

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:33.720
You father and daughter...

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.350
...have completely disregarded our families' friendship.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.920
You insist on opposing me.

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:42.480
It is my son-in-law who gave me this confidence.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.160
What?

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:46.480
Son-in-law?

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:50.440
What kind of magic does that Fan guy have?

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.510
He doesn't have any magic.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:55.110
It's just that his appearance...

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:57.830
...has made me see many things clearly.

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:03.550
Including seeing you clearly.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.000
People...

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:09.960
...really fear comparison.

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:15.000
You mean...

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.000
...I'm not as good as him?

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:23.880
Find a place.

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:25.640
Get rid of him.

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:28.720
What are you saying?

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.070
Don't make a scene.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.240
You dare!

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.510
Don't you forget...

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:35.110
...I am your elder.

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:36.400
Do it.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.160
I watched you grow up!

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.790
Which of you dares?

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:40.920
Tie him up.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:42.550
You...

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:44.030
What are you doing?

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:44.750
Move!

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.110
What are you doing?

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.480
What on earth are you doing?

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.510
I don't need anyone...

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.350
...to be compared with me.

00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:59.270
Ma the Tigress!

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Ma the Tigress! Get the hell out here!

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.030
Ma the Tigress!

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:10.200
Do it then.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.680
I beg you to kill me.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.270
To die in your hands...

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:17.590
...I am willing.

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.310
Don't act like a drunk here.

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:22.590
Why are you so cold to me?

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.240
Out of everyone...

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.960
...I am the most loyal to you.

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:29.680
Why can't you just look at me once more?

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:37.070
I know.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.110
You are the most obedient.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.200
Then you need to make everyone...

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:42.720
...be just like you...

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.480
...and be loyal to me.

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.200
That is the best way for you to love me.

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:51.270
I've always wanted to help you.

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:54.790
I want everyone to submit to you.

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:57.550
But I'm also conflicted.

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.720
I don't want others getting close to you.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.750
I don't want others...

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.590
...to take away your love for me.

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:09.000
Don't worry.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.680
You will always be my one and only Big Brother.

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:13.400
Then why...

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:16.550
...did you appoint a strategist above me?

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.030
My patience is limited.

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:20.350
Look at you.

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.000
As soon as he's mentioned, you get like this.

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.550
What's so good about him?

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:27.960
He thinks of ways to leave here every day.

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:29.440
And drags me along too.

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:30.720
He wants to leave?

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:32.830
I'll call him over for you right now.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:35.200
Ask him to his face.

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:40.110
I'll call him over right away.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.110
What is it?

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:50.750
What's with you?

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:54.400
Ma the Tigress.

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:57.790
What's going on?

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.070
Since he came here...

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:01.480
...how have I treated him?

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:02.590
You've treated me very well.

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:03.440
I'm talking about him.

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:05.720
Ma the Tigress made him Advisor.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.200
Accompanied him on missions.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.640
Doted on him.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.720
The brothers have all seen it.

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.270
I made you second only to me.

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:14.960
I haven't treated you badly.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.200
You treat me like a brother, like a parent.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.590
Then why do you still want to leave?

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:21.790
Leave.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.200
Leave.

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:25.720
Leave.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.070
It's all for you.

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:30.310
For me?

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.880
My condition of fainting at the sight of blood...

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:36.590
I didn't know it was so serious before.

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.720
You took us down the mountain on so many missions.

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.270
You were so mighty and heroic.

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.750
But I'm just holding you back.

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:49.720
You're such a smooth talker.

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:52.310
What's the problem with that?

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.200
You don't have to go on missions anymore.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.270
Not going on missions means I'm a freeloader.

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:02.160
I might as well just leave.

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.000
Besides missions...

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.960
...there are plenty of other things to do.

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:08.440
I won't let you go.

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:10.720
No one will dare object.

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:19.240
Filial piety comes first.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.960
I mainly want to go back and see my parents.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.200
Who are you kidding?

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.070
Your parents died long ago.

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:28.590
I haven't finished.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.960
I want to visit my parents' graves.

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:33.830
And burn some incense for them.

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:35.640
That's simple.

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:37.270
I'll send ten brothers.

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:38.790
To go back with you.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.030
Ten isn't enough.

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:41.480
Then twenty.

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:43.200
So you can show off...

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:44.640
...in front of your parents.

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:49.310
I do have a selfish motive.

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.030
Go on.

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:53.590
I want to go back and see my wife.

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:56.400
You know, Yu Zhen.

00:27:57.550 --> 00:27:59.110
Think about it, I've been away so long.

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.720
Yu Zhen doesn't know my situation.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.400
What if she runs off...

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:05.110
...with someone else?

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:08.070
You really are a romantic.

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:10.110
When the soldiers ease up,

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.110
I'll personally go back with you.

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.400
To see your wife.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.680
If she has run off with someone else,

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:17.750
I'll personally help you get revenge.

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:20.960
Anything else you want to make up?

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:22.590
That's it.

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:24.240
I can't make up anything else.

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:29.680
Then stay here quietly.

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:30.830
Alright.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.110
Will your dad...

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:38.640
...have trouble finding us?

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.310
No.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:40.400
I arranged it with him.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.310
To meet right here.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.160
My husband and Young Master Huo...

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:50.550
...what deep grudge is there between them?

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:56.270
Mainly...

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:58.680
Because of me.

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:04.350
I say, what exactly are you doing?

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:06.240
I just took a girl...

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:07.510
...from your house.

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:09.920
That shouldn't be a crime.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.880
Even if it is a crime,

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:15.110
You can't take the law into your own hands.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.550
And do whatever you please.

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:18.480
Uncle Dong.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:21.440
If you had just peacefully let Xiu Gu...

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.200
...marry into our Huo Family...

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.240
...it wouldn't have come to this.

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.440
Today, it's not that I want to kill you.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.960
Nor does our Young Master want to kill you.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.000
You brought this on yourself.

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:34.110
Today, for the sake of old times...

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:37.160
No, no, no! Don't! Don't!

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.240
I'll make it quick.

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:39.160
Don't!

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.350
Xiu Gu!

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.510
Run! Run as far as you can!

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.640
Don't ever...

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.310
...come back!

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:51.880
Dad!

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.200
Dad!

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:55.750
After them!

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:42.960
Where are we

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:44.270
going now?

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.110
The bandit den.

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:46.590
The bandit den?

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:49.750
Everyone in town says Brother Fan went up the mountain.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.030
I'm going to find him.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:53.240
He will definitely avenge my father.

00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:56.240
Young Master Huo is rich and powerful.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.790
Brother Fan is all alone.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:30:59.200
He's just one man.

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.720
How can he avenge you?

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:03.510
The Brother Fan I know can take on a hundred men.

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:05.240
I believe he can do it.

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:08.720
I don't believe Brother Fan

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.240
would become a bandit.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.790
Why don't you go back first?

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:16.960
Once I find Brother Fan,

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.680
I'll tell him you were here.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:22.960
Come with me.

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:24.440
Let's go back to Weiyuan together.

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:25.440
Back to the Fan house.

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:27.400
We'll tell Great-Uncle what happened here.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.480
He is highly respected.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.680
He'll surely help us find a way.

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.070
This isn't Weiyuan.

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:34.000
There's no Fan house here.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.440
And no Great-Uncle of yours.

00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:38.000
This is the deep wilderness.

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.720
Here, there are only lost paths and no way home.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.750
Here, my father died,

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:43.400
and I can't even retrieve his body.

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:51.750
Sister Yu Zhen,

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:55.240
I don't have a father anymore.

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:00.110
I've lost my father.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.510
I'm going to find Brother Fan.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.790
He can definitely help me.

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:15.110
Are you sure

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.680
Brother Fan went up the mountain?

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.240
Even if it's just a rumor,

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:20.750
I have to try.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.200
Then I'll go with you.

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:25.240
It's a bandit den.

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.550
You don't need to risk your life with me.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:28.790
You and your father

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:29.960
risked your lives to save me.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.110
I won't leave you behind.

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:33.400
Don't move!

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:39.030
Move! Come up the mountain with us.
