WEBVTT

00:00:43.731 --> 00:00:47.068
{\an8}UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

00:00:48.278 --> 00:00:51.364
The birth of Dolly, the lamb cloned
through genetic engineering…

00:00:53.408 --> 00:00:55.577
which demonstrated
the possibility of human cloning,

00:00:56.536 --> 00:00:58.705
and the successful landing
of a space probe on Mars

00:00:58.788 --> 00:01:00.081
all happened in 1997.

00:01:02.083 --> 00:01:03.084
THE THIRD "COLLAPSE"

00:01:03.168 --> 00:01:05.003
As the new millennium dawned,

00:01:05.587 --> 00:01:08.214
the world readied itself
amid great excitement and anxieties.

00:01:09.924 --> 00:01:11.426
THE THIRD WAVE

00:01:15.972 --> 00:01:17.056
CHO DU-PAL

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.100
And there was a woman

00:01:19.684 --> 00:01:22.729
who sought a stunning turnaround,
stirring up waves of her own.

00:01:30.778 --> 00:01:32.155
What else? I'm working.

00:01:32.864 --> 00:01:33.781
I'm on my way.

00:01:46.294 --> 00:01:48.087
The Pitbull is on its way.

00:02:01.184 --> 00:02:03.061
We can trust the witness, right?

00:02:03.144 --> 00:02:05.939
Of course.
The witness is one smart cookie.

00:02:06.731 --> 00:02:08.900
All it takes is one word from me,
and it'll be done.

00:02:11.945 --> 00:02:14.614
To secure your acquittal, Mr. Cho,

00:02:14.697 --> 00:02:16.032
the Financial Supervisory Service

00:02:16.616 --> 00:02:17.617
will stand by you throughout.

00:02:32.715 --> 00:02:33.549
Yes, sir.

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:39.389
Hey! (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:02:39.472 --> 00:02:41.849
You should have makeup and a skirt on.

00:02:41.933 --> 00:02:43.434
How unprofessional.

00:02:43.518 --> 00:02:44.811
Wait, Mr. Cho.

00:02:44.894 --> 00:02:47.146
- She doesn't work here.
- No?

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.147
She's the witness I mentioned earlier.

00:02:49.065 --> 00:02:50.024
Gosh.

00:02:50.108 --> 00:02:51.067
Should I leave?

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.610
- No, don't leave!
- No!

00:02:55.154 --> 00:02:56.030
Coming in.

00:02:57.573 --> 00:03:00.034
Let's all have a drink!

00:03:00.118 --> 00:03:01.244
- Here we go.
- Excellent.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.707
I would've chosen somewhere else
if I had known you were a woman.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.501
Not at all, Mr. Cho.

00:03:08.584 --> 00:03:11.421
Don't be fooled by her looks.
She's a total dude.

00:03:11.504 --> 00:03:12.797
She's no woman.

00:03:16.592 --> 00:03:17.927
All right then.

00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:20.847
Here comes something major.

00:03:36.446 --> 00:03:38.364
You can't change your tune tomorrow.

00:03:38.448 --> 00:03:39.282
You heard that, right?

00:03:39.365 --> 00:03:41.242
Yes, of course.

00:03:41.326 --> 00:03:43.036
You know how I do.

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:46.414
The stage is perfectly set for tomorrow.

00:03:47.957 --> 00:03:50.168
"I swear by my conscience
to speak the whole truth

00:03:50.251 --> 00:03:51.878
and nothing but the truth."

00:03:51.961 --> 00:03:55.298
"Should I lie,
I shall accept punishment for perjury."

00:03:56.132 --> 00:03:57.050
I am Hong Keum-bo from

00:03:57.133 --> 00:04:00.470
the Capital Market Investigation Division
at the Financial Supervisory Service.

00:04:03.222 --> 00:04:05.058
{\an8}The prosecution alleges

00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:07.685
that Mr. Cho Du-pal manipulated
the stock price of MU Holdings,

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.771
but is it truly illegal to buy
an undervalued blue-chip stock low

00:04:09.854 --> 00:04:11.564
and sell it at the upper limit?

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.567
What do you think, Ms. Hong?

00:04:22.784 --> 00:04:24.369
{\an8}WITNESS

00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:27.330
It's blatant stock price manipulation

00:04:27.413 --> 00:04:30.041
by combining corporate
and financial violations.

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:34.837
Ms. Hong,

00:04:34.921 --> 00:04:36.714
please be reminded
that you're our witness.

00:04:38.132 --> 00:04:39.050
"Our" witness?

00:04:42.011 --> 00:04:42.845
{\an8}PROSECUTOR

00:04:45.098 --> 00:04:45.932
CHO DU-PAL

00:04:49.268 --> 00:04:50.561
- Are you Mr. Kim?
- Yes.

00:04:50.645 --> 00:04:51.771
And the merch?

00:04:53.106 --> 00:04:54.607
Let's grab a drink somewhere nice.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:55.983
As you can see, Mr. Cho Du-pal

00:04:56.067 --> 00:04:59.737
was tipped off by an MU Holdings insider
through back channels,

00:04:59.821 --> 00:05:01.406
and used it to line his own pockets.

00:05:04.826 --> 00:05:07.495
{\an8}I hereby submit evidence
demonstrating the procurement of funds

00:05:07.578 --> 00:05:09.247
to manipulate
the stock price of MU Holdings

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.125
and the funneling of illicit profits
through other corporate entities.

00:05:13.835 --> 00:05:14.877
And one more thing.

00:05:18.798 --> 00:05:21.676
I'd also like to submit evidence
of him paying off

00:05:22.301 --> 00:05:24.095
a Financial Supervisory Service employee.

00:05:24.637 --> 00:05:25.638
Hold on!

00:05:25.721 --> 00:05:27.348
You're no cop or prosecutor.

00:05:27.432 --> 00:05:28.474
Who are you to act up?

00:05:28.558 --> 00:05:30.268
I'd watch that tone of yours.

00:05:30.351 --> 00:05:31.727
Why you little…

00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:33.062
Let go of me!

00:05:34.063 --> 00:05:34.897
Calm down.

00:05:34.981 --> 00:05:35.982
Please calm down.

00:05:41.696 --> 00:05:42.530
Calm down!

00:05:44.407 --> 00:05:45.324
Please calm down!

00:05:46.033 --> 00:05:47.785
SEOUL SOUTHERN DISTRICT COURT

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:48.828
Damn it!

00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:51.706
Hey, Hong!

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:53.708
What was that about?

00:05:53.791 --> 00:05:55.251
You blew it at the last moment!

00:05:55.334 --> 00:05:56.669
Sir, what about the money--

00:05:56.752 --> 00:05:57.628
What?

00:05:59.213 --> 00:06:00.173
Damn you!

00:06:05.344 --> 00:06:08.681
Hold on. That's my money.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:10.224
My money…

00:06:10.892 --> 00:06:13.477
Help me pick it up. It's mine. Hurry.

00:06:15.062 --> 00:06:16.063
Hello?

00:06:16.147 --> 00:06:17.106
Yes, sir.

00:06:17.732 --> 00:06:18.566
What?

00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:21.360
Hey, Hwang. It's me.

00:06:21.444 --> 00:06:22.320
DIRECTOR YUN JAE-BEOM

00:06:22.403 --> 00:06:24.322
FINANCIAL SUPERVISORY SERVICE,
CAPITAL MARKET INVESTIGATION DIVISION

00:06:25.198 --> 00:06:27.366
You're being accused of accepting bribes,

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.035
so you've been suspended from duty.

00:06:29.118 --> 00:06:30.286
- Pardon?
- Good luck.

00:06:31.537 --> 00:06:33.789
Wait, sir. Hello?

00:06:33.873 --> 00:06:35.458
That was Director Yun, right?

00:06:35.541 --> 00:06:37.335
I'll say my goodbyes here.

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:39.670
Wait. Hold on. Hey!

00:06:43.466 --> 00:06:46.302
EPISODE 1:
THE WOMAN KNOWN AS THE WITCH OF YEOUIDO

00:07:03.903 --> 00:07:05.404
HANO BANK

00:07:05.488 --> 00:07:06.822
{\an8}JULY 3, 1997, FINANCIAL DISTRICT, YEOUIDO

00:07:06.906 --> 00:07:10.493
{\an8}Foreign capital is exiting swiftly
in the wake of the Asian financial crisis.

00:07:10.576 --> 00:07:12.870
{\an8}The mounting pressure
to service short-term foreign loans

00:07:12.954 --> 00:07:15.039
{\an8}is further stoking anxiety
in financial markets.

00:07:15.122 --> 00:07:16.040
{\an8}FULL-SERVICE SHOE REPAIR

00:07:16.123 --> 00:07:18.417
{\an8}With the rising living costs,

00:07:18.501 --> 00:07:20.878
{\an8}widespread economic difficulties
are to be anticipated.

00:07:22.213 --> 00:07:24.215
{\an8}Seongsu Bridge in Seoul reopened today,

00:07:24.298 --> 00:07:26.384
{\an8}two years and eight months
after its collapse.

00:07:27.301 --> 00:07:30.388
{\an8}The bridge that once took
32 innocent lives

00:07:30.471 --> 00:07:32.682
{\an8}has risen anew as a fortified…

00:07:33.808 --> 00:07:34.642
{\an8}Last…

00:08:12.972 --> 00:08:13.973
Give me a second.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.475
Here you go.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.103
Three cartons of San Cigarettes, please.

00:08:20.229 --> 00:08:21.439
It's for our boss.

00:08:33.743 --> 00:08:34.619
Gosh.

00:08:35.369 --> 00:08:36.662
I'll take a pair of tights too.

00:08:36.746 --> 00:08:38.789
Oh, you can't. Those are reserved.

00:08:38.873 --> 00:08:40.625
It should be first-come, first-served.

00:08:40.708 --> 00:08:41.876
Let me have them.

00:08:47.882 --> 00:08:49.050
HIGH ELASTICITY
SMILE TIGHTS

00:08:52.261 --> 00:08:53.429
Sidewalks have limited space.

00:08:53.512 --> 00:08:56.557
Maybe consider a single file
instead of side-by-side.

00:09:03.773 --> 00:09:04.815
What's her deal?

00:09:25.336 --> 00:09:27.922
I have two bits of good news and one bad.
Pick your choice.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.883
Can we start with the good?

00:09:30.966 --> 00:09:31.926
You have been promoted

00:09:32.009 --> 00:09:34.178
to team manager
at the Financial Supervisory Service,

00:09:34.762 --> 00:09:38.015
and confirmed probe into the slush fund
of Hanmin Investment & Securities.

00:09:38.766 --> 00:09:40.476
I foresaw both.

00:09:40.559 --> 00:09:41.686
And the bad news.

00:09:45.398 --> 00:09:48.109
All your team members
have handed in their resignations.

00:09:48.818 --> 00:09:51.779
They refuse to accept you
as their team manager.

00:09:52.697 --> 00:09:54.782
{\an8}LETTER OF RESIGNATION

00:09:56.867 --> 00:09:58.661
You should process them.

00:09:59.161 --> 00:10:00.371
Hey, kid.

00:10:00.454 --> 00:10:03.916
They're my subordinates too.
They're our family.

00:10:03.999 --> 00:10:05.000
Not for me.

00:10:05.626 --> 00:10:08.129
How are we a family
when we never even shared a meal?

00:10:08.796 --> 00:10:09.880
{\an8}CAPITAL MARKET INVESTIGATION DIVISION

00:10:09.964 --> 00:10:11.632
{\an8}Hong Keum-bo, that ruthless brat.

00:10:11.716 --> 00:10:14.885
How could she stab her boss in the back
to steal his job?

00:10:14.969 --> 00:10:15.970
Listen.

00:10:16.053 --> 00:10:18.431
She has no sense
of camaraderie or loyalty.

00:10:18.514 --> 00:10:20.975
How can we serve
under someone we can't trust?

00:10:21.559 --> 00:10:22.935
The Witch of Yeouido is coming.

00:10:28.816 --> 00:10:31.652
You should be thanking your lucky stars
that you didn't go down with Hwang.

00:10:33.404 --> 00:10:34.572
It was touch-and-go for you.

00:10:44.707 --> 00:10:47.084
{\an8}TEAM MANAGER HONG KEUM-BO

00:10:51.255 --> 00:10:52.965
These are the resignations
you've submitted.

00:10:53.883 --> 00:10:56.135
I guess you were
in such a rush to leave your jobs

00:10:56.218 --> 00:10:58.929
that you completely ignored
the chain of command in this organization

00:10:59.013 --> 00:11:01.182
and went straight
to the director's office.

00:11:10.691 --> 00:11:12.985
Complaints are not exempt from protocol.

00:11:15.237 --> 00:11:17.781
You all have two options at this point.

00:11:17.865 --> 00:11:18.699
Option A.

00:11:19.283 --> 00:11:21.285
"I refuse to serve
under that brat, Hong Keum-bo."

00:11:21.368 --> 00:11:22.578
"Screw this. I quit."

00:11:22.661 --> 00:11:23.621
Option B.

00:11:23.704 --> 00:11:26.665
"Hong Keum-bo, that pitbull,
possesses neither camaraderie nor loyalty,

00:11:26.749 --> 00:11:29.043
but I'll build myself
a lasting career with her

00:11:29.126 --> 00:11:30.669
because she's good at her job."

00:11:33.464 --> 00:11:36.634
Success requires talent, not faith.

00:11:44.183 --> 00:11:45.851
We'll have a meeting in ten minutes.

00:11:51.565 --> 00:11:53.192
Come to the meeting room

00:11:53.776 --> 00:11:54.944
if you wish to work with me.

00:12:31.939 --> 00:12:32.815
Good morning.

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:54.587
While investigating
the offshore shell companies

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:57.089
that diverted funds
for MU Holdings' stock price manipulation,

00:12:57.172 --> 00:12:59.466
I uncovered a fascinating fact.

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:01.468
HANMIN CHAIRMAN KANG PIL-BEOM
SUED FOR ASSAULT BY FEMALE LAWYER

00:13:03.053 --> 00:13:04.722
- There he is!
- Let's go!

00:13:04.805 --> 00:13:07.433
Chairman Kang,
how do you respond to the allegations?

00:13:07.516 --> 00:13:08.976
Do you care to comment?

00:13:09.059 --> 00:13:11.854
CHAIRMAN KANG PIL-BEOM
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

00:13:13.981 --> 00:13:16.150
That case was already dismissed.

00:13:16.233 --> 00:13:17.359
Due to that assault case,

00:13:17.443 --> 00:13:19.612
he handed over
management rights to his only son.

00:13:19.695 --> 00:13:23.282
Pildong was a new law firm
that was established only last November,

00:13:24.158 --> 00:13:26.660
but they ended up
representing Chairman Kang.

00:13:26.744 --> 00:13:27.578
Why?

00:13:27.661 --> 00:13:29.371
Because its senior managing partner

00:13:29.455 --> 00:13:31.665
worked as general counsel
for Hanmin until October.

00:13:31.749 --> 00:13:34.126
Subsequently,
they were appointed as counsel

00:13:34.209 --> 00:13:36.086
for three well-capitalized
shell companies.

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:39.173
We also suspect Hanmin
to be the source of their funds.

00:13:39.256 --> 00:13:42.760
Hey, do you think Hanmin
is some ordinary corner shop?

00:13:42.843 --> 00:13:45.137
You're poking a bear here.

00:13:46.597 --> 00:13:48.766
Why would I ever pursue a corner shop?

00:13:52.936 --> 00:13:54.438
HANMIN'S DECADE-LONG ALLEGATIONS

00:13:54.521 --> 00:13:56.982
In the past decade, Hanmin,
long called the heart of Yeouido,

00:13:57.066 --> 00:14:00.277
has been suspected
of stock price manipulation

00:14:00.361 --> 00:14:01.654
five times.

00:14:01.737 --> 00:14:04.782
Three associates implicated
in the cases died by suicide.

00:14:05.824 --> 00:14:06.909
Victim count soars

00:14:06.992 --> 00:14:10.037
if you include the retail investors
who lost money, time, and lives.

00:14:12.039 --> 00:14:15.292
Slush funds estimated to have been
siphoned by the chairman's family alone

00:14:15.376 --> 00:14:16.710
exceed 100 billion won.

00:14:18.629 --> 00:14:21.382
How much longer must we let
this shameless looting slide?

00:14:22.966 --> 00:14:24.301
It's time we do our jobs.

00:14:25.094 --> 00:14:25.928
All right?

00:14:30.683 --> 00:14:33.018
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

00:14:33.102 --> 00:14:34.853
An internal probe
into Hanmin's slush fund?

00:14:35.437 --> 00:14:37.439
The prosecution
and Financial Supervisory Service

00:14:37.523 --> 00:14:39.233
have already formed a task force team.

00:14:39.316 --> 00:14:42.152
CHIEF OF STAFF SONG JU-RAN
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

00:14:42.236 --> 00:14:45.572
Thank goodness I still have junior alumni
out in the field right now.

00:14:45.656 --> 00:14:47.741
Without me,
you'd never be privy to such intel.

00:14:48.784 --> 00:14:49.660
Mr. Oh.

00:14:50.285 --> 00:14:52.204
I guess your alumni
lacked the clout to stop it.

00:14:52.705 --> 00:14:55.541
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OH DEOK-GYU
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

00:14:55.624 --> 00:14:57.710
Despite our generous yearly
agency "upkeep" payoffs.

00:14:58.419 --> 00:15:01.755
How could you know so little
when you're the chief of staff?

00:15:01.839 --> 00:15:05.009
There's always that one guy
looking to earn a medal wherever you go.

00:15:05.092 --> 00:15:06.260
Is this news to you?

00:15:06.343 --> 00:15:09.888
It's just a pointless moral crusade
fueled by naked ambition.

00:15:09.972 --> 00:15:13.225
And the bastard at the helm
has latched onto our company,

00:15:13.308 --> 00:15:15.352
determined to drag it down.

00:15:15.436 --> 00:15:17.062
Can we get the task force roster?

00:15:17.146 --> 00:15:18.897
Of course. You know me.

00:15:18.981 --> 00:15:20.232
I've already acquired it. Here.

00:15:25.446 --> 00:15:28.240
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES
SLUSH FUND TASK FORCE

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:32.953
{\an8}FINANCIAL SUPERVISORY SERVICE:
YUN JAE-BEOM, HONG KEUM-BO…

00:15:34.705 --> 00:15:36.373
I'll report this to the chairman myself.

00:15:37.166 --> 00:15:41.253
Are you suggesting I let
the prosecution investigate me?

00:15:42.546 --> 00:15:44.173
I believe this is our last chance

00:15:44.256 --> 00:15:47.176
to right the wrongs we may have committed.

00:15:48.552 --> 00:15:49.428
"Our chance"?

00:15:51.513 --> 00:15:52.890
Are you sure this isn't you

00:15:53.849 --> 00:15:56.477
taking your shot
to kick me out and take my place?

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:57.644
Father.

00:15:57.728 --> 00:16:01.065
No one in this country would ever dare
to come after me, you punk.

00:16:01.648 --> 00:16:02.983
This is my company.

00:16:03.067 --> 00:16:05.110
I built it from the ground up…

00:16:05.194 --> 00:16:07.821
"This company
does not belong to me alone."

00:16:08.947 --> 00:16:11.992
"It belongs to
all of the Hanmin employees."

00:16:12.785 --> 00:16:13.994
Those were your words.

00:16:14.536 --> 00:16:15.746
Please reconsider.

00:16:17.456 --> 00:16:18.499
Why you…

00:16:19.374 --> 00:16:20.292
That punk.

00:16:20.375 --> 00:16:21.460
Why I ought to…

00:16:44.191 --> 00:16:45.317
Sir.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.235
Thanks.

00:16:54.535 --> 00:16:55.536
Are you all right?

00:17:01.375 --> 00:17:02.292
Ms. Song.

00:17:03.335 --> 00:17:04.503
Do you think Myeong-hwi…

00:17:06.421 --> 00:17:07.965
could switch sides on me?

00:17:14.138 --> 00:17:15.514
I'll keep an eye on him.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.474
All right.

00:17:18.892 --> 00:17:19.726
You do that.

00:17:22.229 --> 00:17:24.898
We suspect two divisions in Hanmin,

00:17:25.691 --> 00:17:27.985
the Trading and Research Divisions,

00:17:28.068 --> 00:17:29.695
to have spearheaded the illicit trading.

00:17:30.445 --> 00:17:32.990
We've confirmed that a portion
of the domestically acquired slush fund

00:17:33.073 --> 00:17:35.200
was deposited into an account

00:17:35.284 --> 00:17:38.245
{\an8}belonging to Kang Pil-beom's
only daughter, Ms. Kang Nora.

00:17:38.328 --> 00:17:39.246
An overseas account?

00:17:39.329 --> 00:17:41.832
Yes, Kang Nora is a US citizen.

00:17:41.915 --> 00:17:44.751
That'll take even more time
to investigate then.

00:17:47.838 --> 00:17:51.175
Follow the trail of money
to uncover the corrupt instigator.

00:17:51.675 --> 00:17:54.678
In order to secure solid evidence
that can substantiate the charges--

00:17:54.761 --> 00:17:58.140
Right, so if you really wanted
to go after Hanmin,

00:17:58.223 --> 00:18:01.268
you should've called me in
after securing concrete evidence.

00:18:01.894 --> 00:18:03.395
Hong!

00:18:10.861 --> 00:18:13.238
I'll be back after I secure it.

00:18:14.114 --> 00:18:15.199
Take care, sir.

00:18:17.201 --> 00:18:18.035
Evidence!

00:18:21.997 --> 00:18:23.957
He's so damn obnoxious.

00:18:24.041 --> 00:18:26.210
That's bookworms for you.

00:18:28.587 --> 00:18:30.172
You're not any less.

00:18:31.256 --> 00:18:32.549
But still, without him,

00:18:32.633 --> 00:18:35.177
this investigation into Hanmin
would've never taken off.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.638
That's why I'm biting my tongue.

00:18:40.724 --> 00:18:42.226
What's with the attitude?

00:18:43.894 --> 00:18:45.479
Then again, you got solid grades too.

00:19:28.188 --> 00:19:31.024
Let's hurry up.
The president is waiting for us.

00:19:31.108 --> 00:19:33.235
It's not like he's waiting out
in the hot sun.

00:19:33.318 --> 00:19:34.778
GENERAL MANAGER SO GYEONG-DONG
TRADING DIVISION, HANMIN

00:19:34.861 --> 00:19:36.321
MANAGER BANG JIN-MOK
RISK MANAGEMENT DIVISION, HANMIN

00:19:36.405 --> 00:19:37.864
GENERAL MANAGER CHA JUNG-IL
RESEARCH DIVISION, HANMIN

00:19:37.948 --> 00:19:40.617
He's comfortably waiting for us
in his office.

00:19:40.701 --> 00:19:41.618
Hey, Bang.

00:19:41.702 --> 00:19:43.912
At least tuck that darn shirt in,
will you?

00:19:43.996 --> 00:19:45.914
Mind your potbelly first.

00:19:46.999 --> 00:19:48.959
Big Al should be at this thing, not me.

00:19:49.042 --> 00:19:50.585
What does he know?

00:19:50.669 --> 00:19:54.214
The fact that we three were called
means it's an emergency.

00:19:54.298 --> 00:19:55.507
- Let's go already.
- Come on.

00:19:57.467 --> 00:20:01.096
We hear a full-scale investigation
into both breach of fiduciary duty

00:20:01.179 --> 00:20:02.639
and illicit trading is underway.

00:20:04.224 --> 00:20:05.684
We'll respond accordingly,

00:20:06.643 --> 00:20:09.187
but since Trading and Research
are core divisions,

00:20:09.271 --> 00:20:11.398
you will need to
prepare further independently.

00:20:12.524 --> 00:20:13.358
Understood.

00:20:13.942 --> 00:20:15.027
Will do.

00:20:15.736 --> 00:20:17.279
Is there actually a slush fund?

00:20:25.537 --> 00:20:26.496
Even if there is one…

00:20:29.499 --> 00:20:31.043
we must make it not exist.

00:20:35.255 --> 00:20:38.383
First, I'd like to ask Risk Management

00:20:39.009 --> 00:20:42.095
to look into the task force members.

00:20:43.555 --> 00:20:44.973
As in dig for dirt?

00:20:45.057 --> 00:20:45.932
Whatever comes up.

00:20:46.558 --> 00:20:47.976
Find out as much as you can.

00:20:53.106 --> 00:20:54.733

SECOND MEETING REPORT

00:21:05.702 --> 00:21:08.789
Nam Dong-gi, did that fax come in?

00:21:10.916 --> 00:21:12.084
Cheers!

00:21:12.167 --> 00:21:13.627
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:21:28.475 --> 00:21:30.560
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

00:21:53.041 --> 00:21:53.875
NEW MAIL FROM YEHPPEE@KEBEO.CO.KR

00:21:53.959 --> 00:21:54.793
"Yehppee"?

00:21:54.876 --> 00:21:56.044
TIP: REGARDING HANMIN'S SLUSH FUND

00:22:01.216 --> 00:22:06.096
I have the accounting ledger
that proves the Kang family's corruption.

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:10.142
Let's talk in person.

00:22:33.415 --> 00:22:34.749
Are you Yehppee?

00:22:39.546 --> 00:22:40.505
No.

00:22:46.178 --> 00:22:47.179
Inspector Hong?

00:22:54.686 --> 00:22:55.687
President Kang,

00:22:56.521 --> 00:22:59.232
plea bargaining should be done
with the prosecution.

00:22:59.316 --> 00:23:02.235
Guilt needs to be proven
before any bargaining, no?

00:23:02.319 --> 00:23:03.778
You've got a long way to go.

00:23:06.489 --> 00:23:08.533
Oh, I get it.

00:23:08.617 --> 00:23:10.535
Is there a box of cash in your trunk?

00:23:11.036 --> 00:23:13.163
Overflowing with fresh and green bills?

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:18.043
I have something even better.

00:23:21.463 --> 00:23:22.964
How about the slush fund ledger?

00:23:23.632 --> 00:23:24.883
The slush fund ledger?

00:23:31.431 --> 00:23:32.641
Why aren't you answering it?

00:23:32.724 --> 00:23:34.142
That will be my assistant calling.

00:23:35.143 --> 00:23:38.688
My assistant is always by my side,
fully aware of what I do and whom I meet.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.275
But I left today without saying anything.

00:23:44.694 --> 00:23:45.570
I wanted to see

00:23:46.863 --> 00:23:49.658
if you were someone
who could be entrusted with a life…

00:23:53.536 --> 00:23:55.622
for myself.

00:23:59.209 --> 00:24:00.585
Whose life?

00:24:01.294 --> 00:24:03.255
Chairman Kang Pil-beom's?

00:24:04.172 --> 00:24:05.131
Or yours?

00:24:20.438 --> 00:24:22.232
I'm talking about Hanmin's.

00:24:24.109 --> 00:24:27.070
You could end up receiving
a prison sentence.

00:24:27.153 --> 00:24:29.739
Yes. I'm prepared for as much.

00:24:31.449 --> 00:24:34.577
"Follow the trail of money
to uncover the corrupt instigator."

00:24:36.788 --> 00:24:37.747
Those were your words.

00:24:39.291 --> 00:24:43.044
Follow the trail of money
to uncover the corrupt instigator.

00:24:44.838 --> 00:24:45.839
Do we have a damn rat?

00:24:45.922 --> 00:24:48.383
If they're not stopped now,
they'll siphon off the money

00:24:48.466 --> 00:24:50.844
even more carefully and systematically.

00:24:51.845 --> 00:24:54.055
To prevent that from happening,
Yehppee and I

00:24:54.139 --> 00:24:56.641
are getting the ledger together
for whistleblowing purposes.

00:25:01.855 --> 00:25:03.356
I believe this will be…

00:25:05.608 --> 00:25:06.943
our last chance

00:25:07.986 --> 00:25:10.280
to flip the tables.

00:25:23.752 --> 00:25:25.337
If you're messing with me,

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.172
or if you ever betray me in the future,

00:25:27.255 --> 00:25:30.967
you and I will both be
swimming with the fishes in the Han River.

00:25:31.051 --> 00:25:32.719
I plan to live

00:25:33.887 --> 00:25:36.848
a long, honest life with integrity.

00:25:55.367 --> 00:25:56.242
What's this?

00:25:57.285 --> 00:25:58.912
Consider it a welcome gift.

00:26:00.663 --> 00:26:02.832
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

00:26:14.177 --> 00:26:17.180
After you requested solid evidence
that outlines the flow of funds,

00:26:17.263 --> 00:26:20.642
I was able to confirm a few details
of the funds Hanmin leaked abroad.

00:26:22.435 --> 00:26:23.269
You're quick.

00:26:23.353 --> 00:26:26.773
You asked for evidence, didn't you, sir?

00:26:28.191 --> 00:26:29.484
We'd like to request

00:26:29.567 --> 00:26:31.945
a search and seizure warrant
based on evidence of funds diverted

00:26:32.028 --> 00:26:34.531
to Ms. Kang Nora's personal account
and offshore corporations.

00:26:34.614 --> 00:26:35.740
Yes, all right.

00:26:39.035 --> 00:26:40.412
FOREIGN EXCHANGE RECEIPT

00:26:51.214 --> 00:26:53.550
Once the warrant is issued,
the prosecution will search and seize

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:55.593
tomorrow morning.

00:26:56.469 --> 00:26:59.431
Let's meet up at our spot tonight.

00:27:00.932 --> 00:27:01.766
All right.

00:27:12.652 --> 00:27:15.530
Multivitamin, amino acids,
and deer antler extract, sir.

00:27:18.741 --> 00:27:19.576
Thank you.

00:27:28.918 --> 00:27:30.086
I sometimes think about

00:27:30.753 --> 00:27:33.214
what would've happened
if I had finished med school.

00:27:33.882 --> 00:27:36.551
The chairman would've bought a hospital.

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:40.805
I wouldn't have been a good doctor.

00:27:46.686 --> 00:27:49.522
I heard you were picked
as the Outstanding Woman Employee.

00:27:49.606 --> 00:27:51.024
Congratulations.

00:27:51.566 --> 00:27:52.442
It's a cash bonus.

00:27:52.525 --> 00:27:53.693
Oh my.

00:27:55.945 --> 00:27:57.864
You did manage to become a good boss.

00:27:59.407 --> 00:28:00.450
Thank you.

00:28:07.415 --> 00:28:10.251
I think President Kang has a woman.

00:28:10.335 --> 00:28:11.294
Who?

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:15.465
I'm not sure,
but he's been seeing her regularly.

00:28:16.424 --> 00:28:19.135
I heard him setting up a date for tonight.

00:28:21.179 --> 00:28:22.138
All right.

00:28:41.407 --> 00:28:42.867
You can pick up the slush fund ledger

00:28:43.493 --> 00:28:45.662
at the president's office
on the 12th floor

00:28:46.621 --> 00:28:48.248
in Hanmin's head office.

00:28:53.336 --> 00:28:55.296
It's being delivered as we speak.

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:56.798

00:29:10.186 --> 00:29:11.688
{\an8}WEEKLY TRADING RISK SUMMARY REPORT

00:29:40.049 --> 00:29:43.595
You're listening to Sunrise Radio Show.
The time is now 5 a.m.

00:29:44.095 --> 00:29:46.222
The first song I'll play for you today

00:29:46.306 --> 00:29:48.099
is from the soundtrack for the film, Beat.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.769
Here's Im Chang-jung's "Woeful Ballad."

00:31:00.254 --> 00:31:01.297
- Hey, son.
- Hey!

00:31:02.256 --> 00:31:04.926
I knew you'd show up in this dismal state.

00:31:05.009 --> 00:31:06.469
Good morning to you, too, Dad.

00:31:06.552 --> 00:31:08.846
You weren't drinking all night, right?

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:10.014
I didn't drink at all.

00:31:10.098 --> 00:31:12.809
I saw three late-night movies in Jongno.

00:31:12.892 --> 00:31:15.812
Change before you go up
to see the chairman. Now.

00:31:18.189 --> 00:31:19.774
What's with this emergency meeting?

00:31:19.857 --> 00:31:21.526
Are all the geezers here already?

00:31:21.609 --> 00:31:22.485
Why you…

00:31:23.486 --> 00:31:24.696
Take care of that for me.

00:31:24.779 --> 00:31:27.198
I'm worried he's too good-looking,
just like me.

00:31:37.333 --> 00:31:38.292
Put your game away.

00:31:40.044 --> 00:31:41.754
Read the room. The chairman is coming!

00:32:03.568 --> 00:32:06.487
Don't you all have brains
between those ears?

00:32:06.571 --> 00:32:08.197
Are your hands and feet just for show?

00:32:10.074 --> 00:32:12.076
How could I have been informed

00:32:12.618 --> 00:32:15.705
of the prosecution's search and seizure

00:32:15.788 --> 00:32:17.874
just three hours
before it's supposed to happen?

00:32:18.458 --> 00:32:20.626
I actually acquired intel
that the prosecution

00:32:21.127 --> 00:32:23.755
was carrying out a probe a few days ago.

00:32:23.838 --> 00:32:24.964
And?

00:32:25.715 --> 00:32:28.426
President Kang said
he wanted to tell you himself.

00:32:29.343 --> 00:32:30.178
He insisted.

00:32:30.762 --> 00:32:31.888
What did you just say?

00:32:33.097 --> 00:32:35.975
Myeong-hwi knew about this?

00:32:36.934 --> 00:32:37.935
Yes, sir.

00:32:39.896 --> 00:32:41.439
Where is he right now?

00:32:42.482 --> 00:32:43.399
Well, I…

00:32:44.525 --> 00:32:45.818
I'll give him a call, Grandfather.

00:32:50.782 --> 00:32:51.657
Hello?

00:32:54.368 --> 00:32:55.536
What?

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:56.829
The police?

00:33:05.004 --> 00:33:06.047
The deceased victim

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:09.175
in the traffic accident that occurred
at 6 a.m. today in Mapo-gu

00:33:09.258 --> 00:33:11.552
{\an8}was identified as
Hanmin President Kang Myeong-hwi,

00:33:11.636 --> 00:33:15.264
{\an8}who was under investigation
for fiduciary breach and embezzlement.

00:33:16.307 --> 00:33:19.769
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES PRESIDENT
KANG MYEONG-HWI KILLED IN TRAFFIC ACCIDENT

00:33:24.649 --> 00:33:27.193
{\an8}You should've told me that sooner,
you punk.

00:33:27.944 --> 00:33:30.113
I wanted to secure the evidence first.

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:38.996
He told me he'd leave
the slush fund ledger

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.456
in his office on the 12th floor.

00:33:41.666 --> 00:33:43.292
We just need to get it
during today's search and seizure--

00:33:43.376 --> 00:33:44.544
Seriously?

00:33:44.627 --> 00:33:46.671
You expect me to proceed with that search?

00:33:47.171 --> 00:33:49.966
The only son
of the great Chairman Kang is dead!

00:33:50.049 --> 00:33:52.468
I'm also upset
about President Kang's accident,

00:33:53.636 --> 00:33:56.681
but we need to retrieve
the slush fund ledger.

00:34:03.521 --> 00:34:04.730
{\an8}QUARTERLY BUSINESS PLAN

00:34:08.025 --> 00:34:09.110
Did you find it?

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:12.196
What's wrong? Is it not there?

00:34:12.864 --> 00:34:14.073
This can't be.

00:34:15.158 --> 00:34:16.701
MEETING ROOM

00:34:18.661 --> 00:34:19.871
The investigation's suspended?

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:24.167
The press has turned on us
after President Kang's death.

00:34:24.792 --> 00:34:28.087
They're even saying the pressure
from the investigation led him to suicide.

00:34:28.754 --> 00:34:30.965
It wasn't suicide. If anything, homicide--

00:34:31.048 --> 00:34:33.259
You're in no place to make such calls.

00:34:33.885 --> 00:34:35.511
What if it wasn't an accident?

00:34:35.595 --> 00:34:37.930
What if Chairman Kang stepped in
after he discovered

00:34:38.014 --> 00:34:41.517
that President Kang
had decided to join forces with us?

00:34:42.101 --> 00:34:44.187
- Hey.
- What's this now?

00:34:44.687 --> 00:34:46.147
Who did he join forces with?

00:34:47.857 --> 00:34:49.483
Our Inspector Hong Keum-bo

00:34:49.567 --> 00:34:52.028
had been covertly colluding
with President Kang.

00:34:52.111 --> 00:34:53.654
They'd sort of become acquaintances…

00:34:55.531 --> 00:34:56.657
What are you…

00:34:56.741 --> 00:34:58.284
Director Yun just found this out.

00:35:00.119 --> 00:35:02.496
You should tell them yourself, Ms. Hong.

00:35:03.039 --> 00:35:04.123
Shut up.

00:35:07.168 --> 00:35:08.169
It appears…

00:35:09.754 --> 00:35:11.380
you need to explain yourself,

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:13.716
Inspector Hong Keum-bo.

00:36:02.598 --> 00:36:03.432

Good work!

00:36:33.754 --> 00:36:35.131
Congratulations!

00:36:35.214 --> 00:36:36.424
- Team!
- Manager!

00:36:36.507 --> 00:36:39.010
- Sir!
- Why, thank you, everyone.

00:36:39.677 --> 00:36:41.178
Let our camaraderie never die.

00:36:42.305 --> 00:36:47.184
But how could I possibly move in
when the garbage truck hasn't left yet?

00:36:52.898 --> 00:36:54.817
- Team Manager Nam!
- Sir!

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:56.319
Sure. Thanks.

00:37:13.419 --> 00:37:14.462
Mom…

00:37:20.051 --> 00:37:22.803
ULLALA CHICKEN

00:37:25.973 --> 00:37:27.224
A bottle of soju, please.

00:37:28.142 --> 00:37:29.560
Can't you see we're busy?

00:37:29.643 --> 00:37:32.146
You can't be a spinster
who just sits on her ass all day.

00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:52.875
Honey, I think I need a new motorcycle.

00:37:52.958 --> 00:37:53.959
Hey, it's been a while.

00:37:56.545 --> 00:37:59.048
Why, it's my dearest daughter.

00:37:59.131 --> 00:38:01.425
Everyone, let me introduce you to her.

00:38:01.509 --> 00:38:03.719
She's my eldest
who works in a fancy office in Seoul.

00:38:03.803 --> 00:38:05.262
Wow, look at you drinking soju straight.

00:38:05.346 --> 00:38:06.555
So cool.

00:38:07.848 --> 00:38:08.682
Here.

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:12.853
Mom, should I just quit my job?

00:38:12.937 --> 00:38:14.939
That's an excellent idea.

00:38:15.022 --> 00:38:17.441
You've been a career woman long enough.
It's time to get married.

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:20.611
The blind date
you ruthlessly turned down last year

00:38:21.153 --> 00:38:22.613
just had a baby boy.

00:38:22.696 --> 00:38:25.074
Apparently, people call that
a "honeymoon baby."

00:38:25.783 --> 00:38:29.370
If you'd just been a bit nicer to him,
that would've been your baby.

00:38:29.453 --> 00:38:31.914
That's just your wishful thinking.

00:38:31.997 --> 00:38:34.792
…and the slush fund investigation
has come to a halt.

00:38:34.875 --> 00:38:37.044
The arrest warrant
for Chairman Kang Pil-beom

00:38:37.128 --> 00:38:38.963
has been dismissed.

00:38:39.713 --> 00:38:44.427
Citing insufficient evidence, prosecutors
decided not to indict on allegations

00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:48.013
that hundreds of billions of won had been
diverted into an illegal slush fund.

00:38:48.514 --> 00:38:51.016
On July 22nd,
the legal community weighed in,

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:52.935
stating that the prosecution

00:38:53.018 --> 00:38:55.771
must have arrived at this decision
due to insufficient discovery

00:38:55.855 --> 00:38:57.356
after their search and seizure…

00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.774
It's not too late.

00:38:58.858 --> 00:39:00.734
Anything's possible
between a man and a woman.

00:39:00.818 --> 00:39:03.446
Just start dating.
You need to start to progress.

00:39:03.529 --> 00:39:06.157
We actually just received
another blind date offer.

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:08.409
The deaconess's paternal cousin's
daughter-in-law's

00:39:08.492 --> 00:39:09.577
maternal cousin's brother.

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:10.911
- It's too good to pass up.
- Yes.

00:39:10.995 --> 00:39:12.621
Let's proceed. Set a date.

00:39:12.705 --> 00:39:13.789
I should get going.

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:16.917
Hold on. Take this with you.

00:39:19.295 --> 00:39:21.130
This is kimchi,

00:39:21.213 --> 00:39:22.631
and this is boiled chicken.

00:39:22.715 --> 00:39:25.426
The weather's warm,
so put it straight in the fridge.

00:39:26.135 --> 00:39:27.386
I didn't bring my car.

00:39:31.348 --> 00:39:33.976
Beyond the Han River, to the World!
To the Future!

00:39:34.477 --> 00:39:36.437
That's a talisman for attracting men.

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:38.981
I had to fry ten extra chickens
to pay for this.

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:41.609
Do you really think that would work?

00:39:41.692 --> 00:39:45.404
Would you really want a son-in-law
who was drawn to me not out of love,

00:39:45.488 --> 00:39:46.989
but only because of that talisman?

00:39:47.072 --> 00:39:48.240
You think I want to do this?

00:39:48.324 --> 00:39:50.534
Your married friends
already have kids in school.

00:39:51.118 --> 00:39:53.454
Mom, I have no friends.

00:39:54.205 --> 00:39:55.456
Unbelievable.

00:39:55.539 --> 00:39:57.541
It attracts men.
You want me to carry it around?

00:39:57.625 --> 00:40:00.252
Why would I carry it around?
I have no need for it at all.

00:40:00.336 --> 00:40:01.462
HANMIN IS LOOKING FOR ASPIRING TALENT

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:10.262
Jeez, my mom's really something else.

00:40:12.848 --> 00:40:13.766
Hey!

00:40:14.808 --> 00:40:16.101
You damn punks!

00:40:16.602 --> 00:40:17.436
Damn it!

00:40:19.313 --> 00:40:20.523
Did you just get mugged?

00:40:20.606 --> 00:40:21.440
Yes.

00:40:21.524 --> 00:40:23.943
- Get in.
- Thank you.

00:40:28.322 --> 00:40:29.156
What are you doing?

00:40:30.991 --> 00:40:32.034
Hurry up and get in.

00:40:34.078 --> 00:40:35.412
You can go. I'm fine.

00:40:41.418 --> 00:40:42.419
Damn it.

00:40:50.511 --> 00:40:51.637
This is why

00:40:52.555 --> 00:40:55.474
you should know your place and not act up.

00:40:56.183 --> 00:40:57.184
You know?

00:41:14.368 --> 00:41:15.411
You little…

00:41:33.846 --> 00:41:35.055
- Come here.
- You're dead.

00:42:02.666 --> 00:42:04.585
The late Brother Peter Kang Myeong-hwi,

00:42:04.668 --> 00:42:06.962
a servant of the Lord
who became one with God,

00:42:07.046 --> 00:42:11.884
strove to live out the Word of God
as taught in Sacred Scripture.

00:42:12.968 --> 00:42:14.762
Let us pray for our brother Peter,

00:42:14.845 --> 00:42:18.515
who, having been called home by the Lord,

00:42:18.599 --> 00:42:21.518
departed from the side of his loved ones
at his young age.

00:42:23.729 --> 00:42:27.650
May our brother Peter,
and all the faithful departed,

00:42:27.733 --> 00:42:31.862
through the mercy of God,
come to rest in the peace of eternal life.

00:42:31.945 --> 00:42:33.197
Amen.

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.657
- Amen.
- Amen!

00:42:37.201 --> 00:42:38.077
What's wrong with you?

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:39.953
- Damn, that startled me.
- Sit.

00:42:40.412 --> 00:42:41.538
Unbelievable.

00:42:41.622 --> 00:42:43.791
- I'm sorry.
- Sit down.

00:43:03.686 --> 00:43:08.607
I thought today was just for family.

00:43:09.108 --> 00:43:11.944
MADAM CHOI IN-JA
CHAIRMAN KANG PIL-BEOM'S EX-WIFE

00:43:12.027 --> 00:43:13.237
Is this any place

00:43:13.946 --> 00:43:18.158
for the chairman's ex-wife,
who divorced him 20 years ago, to be?

00:43:18.242 --> 00:43:19.326
I do wonder.

00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:20.911
We still have our Nora.

00:43:20.994 --> 00:43:23.205
I had to be here as her mother.

00:43:23.872 --> 00:43:24.790
After all, our Nora

00:43:25.374 --> 00:43:27.376
is the chairman's only child now.

00:43:30.838 --> 00:43:33.549
You were kicked out of here ages ago.

00:43:33.632 --> 00:43:36.427
I was never kicked out.
I walked out on my own.

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:39.012
Albert's mother passed forever ago.

00:43:39.096 --> 00:43:41.890
Yet here you are, still pathetically
leeching off your in-law.

00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:44.685
You dare raise your voices in my house?

00:43:50.649 --> 00:43:51.525
Sit.

00:43:59.366 --> 00:44:00.617
If Nora survives

00:44:01.535 --> 00:44:04.496
the three-month probationary period

00:44:05.247 --> 00:44:08.208
and becomes a full-time employee
at Hanmin Investment & Securities,

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:13.005
then I'll let you inherit
the shares of the company

00:44:13.088 --> 00:44:15.424
that I intended to pass down
to Myeong-hwi.

00:44:17.092 --> 00:44:18.969
My goodness. Nora.

00:44:20.679 --> 00:44:22.014
But, sir.

00:44:22.097 --> 00:44:24.433
Nora didn't even major in business.

00:44:24.516 --> 00:44:26.810
But Albert, who studied business
and did nothing else,

00:44:26.894 --> 00:44:29.021
works at the company too.

00:44:29.104 --> 00:44:31.398
Didn't you drop out
before you even got that degree?

00:44:31.482 --> 00:44:32.441
Yes.

00:44:32.941 --> 00:44:34.359
- See?
- Come on now.

00:44:36.278 --> 00:44:37.738
Nora.

00:44:37.821 --> 00:44:39.323
When you were little,

00:44:39.406 --> 00:44:43.327
your mother paraded you around,
and everyone knew your face.

00:44:43.827 --> 00:44:46.955
But the only ones
who know what you look like now

00:44:47.039 --> 00:44:49.458
are in this room.

00:44:50.375 --> 00:44:51.668
Thus,

00:44:51.752 --> 00:44:54.463
you must not let on
that you're my daughter.

00:44:55.172 --> 00:44:56.965
And follow Ms. Song's guidance

00:44:57.591 --> 00:44:59.760
to prepare for your next step, all right?

00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:06.099
We're done here.

00:45:06.725 --> 00:45:07.893
Wait, sir.

00:45:07.976 --> 00:45:10.062
I implore you to reconsider.

00:45:10.145 --> 00:45:12.272
You do not get a say!

00:45:13.357 --> 00:45:16.193
You just focus on preparing
for the press conference.

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:22.908
Nora, this worked out so well.

00:45:23.659 --> 00:45:24.868
Congratulations on your new job, Auntie.

00:45:25.327 --> 00:45:26.912
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

00:45:34.878 --> 00:45:36.630
Mom, I can't do it.

00:45:36.713 --> 00:45:37.881
I don't want to work there.

00:45:37.965 --> 00:45:39.633
Send me back to America.

00:45:39.716 --> 00:45:41.468
Be quiet.

00:45:41.552 --> 00:45:43.845
You said you wanted to spend your life

00:45:43.929 --> 00:45:45.764
burning through the money
your father never spent on you.

00:45:45.847 --> 00:45:48.684
If you give up and surrender now,

00:45:48.767 --> 00:45:52.312
Albert will take this house,
the company, and everything else. Got it?

00:45:56.108 --> 00:45:58.735
HOSPITAL

00:45:58.819 --> 00:46:00.862
PLASTER ROOM

00:46:05.617 --> 00:46:07.452
Damn, seriously?

00:46:10.372 --> 00:46:11.415
Keum-bo!

00:46:14.293 --> 00:46:15.127
Hold on.

00:46:16.503 --> 00:46:17.379
Are you okay?

00:46:17.462 --> 00:46:19.172
Have I been admitted?

00:46:20.507 --> 00:46:22.092
WISHING YOU A SPEEDY RECOVERY
GET BETTER SOON

00:46:27.222 --> 00:46:28.682
Maybe someone at Hanmin

00:46:28.765 --> 00:46:32.102
found out about you and President Kang?

00:46:32.185 --> 00:46:34.104
That asshole prosecutor
was attacked last night.

00:46:34.187 --> 00:46:35.939
He has a 12-week recovery ahead of him.

00:46:36.023 --> 00:46:37.816
This is undoubtedly a warning.

00:46:38.692 --> 00:46:41.862
They're saying they'll come after you
if you go after them.

00:46:45.365 --> 00:46:46.450
But you know,

00:46:47.075 --> 00:46:49.703
they must be doing this
because there's something to hide.

00:46:49.786 --> 00:46:51.913
What exactly are you trying to say?

00:46:51.997 --> 00:46:54.041
What if we go in person

00:46:54.124 --> 00:46:56.293
to retrieve the slush fund ledger?

00:46:56.376 --> 00:46:58.545
Who? How in the world would we do that?

00:46:58.629 --> 00:47:00.047
Look at the state I'm in right now.

00:47:10.891 --> 00:47:12.309
BEYOND THE HAN RIVER, TO THE WORLD!
TO THE FUTURE!

00:47:12.392 --> 00:47:14.853
HANMIN AWAITS
MOTIVATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES

00:47:19.441 --> 00:47:21.652
We'll keep it a secret from the office.

00:47:21.735 --> 00:47:24.446
It'll be a secret operation
with just you and me.

00:47:26.198 --> 00:47:28.700
You can't see
what's right under your nose.

00:47:29.326 --> 00:47:31.870
They wouldn't imagine you doing this
in their wildest dreams.

00:47:37.042 --> 00:47:39.670
I won't be under their noses.
I'll be stuck in a death trap.

00:47:40.754 --> 00:47:43.507
Do you really think President Kang
died in a car accident?

00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:46.134
Also, I'm a well-educated woman.

00:47:46.218 --> 00:47:48.553
I'm a career woman with ten years
of experience in Yeouido!

00:47:49.137 --> 00:47:50.764
And you want me to go undercover

00:47:50.847 --> 00:47:52.516
as some entry-level minion?

00:47:58.063 --> 00:47:59.815
- Damn it!
- But I like the plan…

00:47:59.898 --> 00:48:02.109
Wait. Hold on, Hong.

00:48:02.192 --> 00:48:03.276
Hong! Stop!

00:48:04.778 --> 00:48:07.531
Hong! Come on! Wait!

00:48:11.368 --> 00:48:12.953
Hong!

00:48:15.747 --> 00:48:16.957
{\an8}BEYOND THE HAN RIVER, TO THE WORLD!
TO THE FUTURE!

00:48:17.999 --> 00:48:19.292
BEYOND THE HAN RIVER, TO THE WORLD!
TO THE FUTURE!

00:48:25.465 --> 00:48:26.299
STAFF RECRUITMENT

00:48:44.359 --> 00:48:46.445
{\an8}ONCE IN A LIFETIME CHANCE!
HANMIN IS HIRING

00:48:46.528 --> 00:48:47.863
Take it easy.

00:48:48.447 --> 00:48:50.115
I'll take care of everything.

00:49:00.625 --> 00:49:01.668
Where did she go?

00:49:04.963 --> 00:49:06.548
Jeez, where the hell did she go?

00:49:16.725 --> 00:49:17.809
{\an8}Director Yun!

00:49:20.187 --> 00:49:22.814
{\an8}All right, sorry. I was shortsighted.

00:49:22.898 --> 00:49:24.483
Of course, this wouldn't work.

00:49:24.566 --> 00:49:27.527
I mean, you're 35.

00:49:27.611 --> 00:49:30.280
Who would ever think
you're in your twenties?

00:49:30.363 --> 00:49:31.865
Maybe a mom of a 20-year-old.

00:49:34.367 --> 00:49:35.202
Sir.

00:49:35.744 --> 00:49:38.747
For the record,
everyone says I look young for my age.

00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:42.042
Everyone thinks I'm in my twenties.
They're so shocked when they hear my age.

00:49:46.671 --> 00:49:48.089
Why am I explaining myself?

00:49:48.882 --> 00:49:50.217
So?

00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:52.427
Are you saying
you'll give it serious consideration?

00:49:52.511 --> 00:49:53.470
No.

00:49:54.012 --> 00:49:56.556
If you want it so badly, do it yourself.

00:50:00.185 --> 00:50:01.102
{\an8}What's this?

00:50:01.603 --> 00:50:02.604
{\an8}I'M TAKING PTO

00:50:02.687 --> 00:50:04.981
{\an8}Wait, hold on. Hong Keum-bo!

00:50:05.565 --> 00:50:08.276
{\an8}CHAIRMAN KANG PIL-BEOM'S
NATIONAL PRESS CONFERENCE

00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:10.320
I devoted my entire life

00:50:11.822 --> 00:50:16.034
to serving the national economy
and improving the lives

00:50:16.618 --> 00:50:18.829
of the people.

00:50:19.621 --> 00:50:21.790
There may have been mistakes,

00:50:22.374 --> 00:50:24.042
but there was no illegality.

00:50:26.586 --> 00:50:28.088
At this moment,

00:50:28.171 --> 00:50:30.090
I'm just a man

00:50:30.924 --> 00:50:32.759
who lost his one and only son

00:50:34.469 --> 00:50:36.763
and failed as a father.

00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:52.904
{\an8}BREAKING NEWS: HANMIN CHAIRMAN KANG
APOLOGIZES TO THE NATION

00:50:54.614 --> 00:50:55.740
Even nine years ago,

00:50:56.408 --> 00:51:00.203
nefarious forces slandered and attacked

00:51:00.287 --> 00:51:02.247
Hanmin Investment & Securities.

00:51:03.164 --> 00:51:05.625
However, it was all a lie.

00:51:07.085 --> 00:51:08.128
And again, this time,

00:51:08.795 --> 00:51:10.630
I, Kang Pil-beom,

00:51:11.172 --> 00:51:13.341
will not settle.

00:51:14.092 --> 00:51:17.387
Hanmin Investment & Securities
is a VIP client at our accounting firm.

00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:19.514
- Please take good care of us.
- Thank you.

00:51:19.598 --> 00:51:22.142
…committed suicide
by jumping from his apartment building.

00:51:22.225 --> 00:51:24.561
She reported Hanmin for accounting fraud,

00:51:24.644 --> 00:51:26.479
but their countersuit ruined her.

00:51:28.273 --> 00:51:29.399
I will continue to

00:51:29.941 --> 00:51:35.238
stand firm against schemes,
fabrications, and betrayal.

00:51:36.615 --> 00:51:39.200
I will carry on Kang Myeong-hwi's legacy

00:51:39.284 --> 00:51:41.870
with unwavering determination

00:51:42.454 --> 00:51:44.623
to bring forth
a new Hanmin Investment & Securities

00:51:45.248 --> 00:51:50.378
that will be worthy
of the Republic of Korea's stature.

00:51:50.462 --> 00:51:52.130
FRAUD AND SLUSH FUND CHARGES ARE BASELESS!

00:51:52.213 --> 00:51:53.882
KANG, THE "PHOENIX OF YEOUIDO,"
PREPARES A COMEBACK

00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:14.653
I'll proceed
with the Hanmin undercover investigation.

00:52:15.236 --> 00:52:16.196
You've been informed.

00:52:20.492 --> 00:52:21.868
My goodness.

00:52:21.952 --> 00:52:25.080
You refused to even budge
when I begged you.

00:52:25.705 --> 00:52:27.874
Now that it's a hot mess, you want to go?

00:52:28.375 --> 00:52:30.168
That ship has sailed.

00:52:30.251 --> 00:52:31.252
It's all over.

00:52:33.672 --> 00:52:36.466
And they concluded the investigation
into President Kang's car accident.

00:52:37.509 --> 00:52:39.928
But that was no accident.

00:52:42.973 --> 00:52:45.850
If I'm being honest,
I didn't trust him 100%.

00:52:45.934 --> 00:52:47.477
I only realized he was being genuine

00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:50.814
after he died
and Yehppee went into hiding.

00:52:51.898 --> 00:52:53.650
You saw Chairman Kang's
press conference, right?

00:52:53.733 --> 00:52:54.901
Even nine years ago,

00:52:56.152 --> 00:52:57.904
nefarious forces slandered and attacked

00:52:57.988 --> 00:53:01.032
Hanmin Investment & Securities.

00:53:01.783 --> 00:53:04.119
However, it was all a lie.

00:53:04.202 --> 00:53:06.079
What happened nine years ago
can't happen again.

00:53:09.416 --> 00:53:11.251
I'll find Yehppee within three months…

00:53:13.253 --> 00:53:15.880
and retrieve the slush fund ledger.

00:53:41.031 --> 00:53:43.408
All documents
once submitted to President Kang

00:53:43.491 --> 00:53:44.534
have been shredded.

00:53:45.535 --> 00:53:47.245
And the police have quietly concluded

00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:49.414
his traffic accident investigation.

00:53:49.998 --> 00:53:50.874
Now,

00:53:51.374 --> 00:53:53.460
who knows about the slush fund details

00:53:54.711 --> 00:53:57.756
and the hidden cache?

00:53:57.839 --> 00:53:58.757
Only you…

00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:01.760
and me, sir.

00:54:05.472 --> 00:54:06.681
Betrayal

00:54:07.182 --> 00:54:10.518
is unacceptable.

00:54:19.194 --> 00:54:22.363
People often think otherwise,

00:54:23.406 --> 00:54:25.241
but my first

00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:28.203
and most cherished son…

00:54:30.121 --> 00:54:32.123
has always been Hanmin.

00:54:46.179 --> 00:54:47.680
I can't believe this brat.

00:54:47.764 --> 00:54:50.266
You'd think she was robbed.

00:54:50.934 --> 00:54:51.893
Jeez.

00:54:53.853 --> 00:54:56.356
Look at all these flashy clothes.

00:54:56.981 --> 00:55:01.111
Gosh, this will fall apart
as soon as you wear it.

00:55:04.697 --> 00:55:06.241
This room is a mess.

00:55:07.826 --> 00:55:08.910
What is this?

00:55:09.494 --> 00:55:12.288
She must be sweeping up
all the dirt in the world with these.

00:55:12.789 --> 00:55:13.790
Gross.

00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:22.715
Ripped jeans…

00:55:22.799 --> 00:55:24.092
What are you doing in my room?

00:55:31.933 --> 00:55:33.309
Jeez.

00:55:40.650 --> 00:55:42.068
I said, what are you doing in my room?

00:55:42.652 --> 00:55:45.321
I was just stopping by and…

00:55:50.618 --> 00:55:51.870
Stop it.

00:55:52.579 --> 00:55:53.997
What's wrong with your arm?

00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:55.915
I injured it recently.

00:55:58.042 --> 00:55:59.002
So it hurts?

00:56:03.131 --> 00:56:04.716
SHINING PINK BOLERO
RAGLAN SLEEVE CARDIGAN

00:56:06.593 --> 00:56:09.179
CROPPED TEE, WIDE JEANS
POPULAR SKINCARE

00:56:11.639 --> 00:56:12.724
What's this?

00:56:14.809 --> 00:56:15.643
Hey.

00:56:15.727 --> 00:56:17.562
No grown-up should let
their belly hang out like that.

00:56:19.022 --> 00:56:19.939
Well…

00:56:22.358 --> 00:56:23.985
Do you think you can help me out?

00:56:25.111 --> 00:56:26.279
Truth is,

00:56:26.362 --> 00:56:29.115
I'm looking to adopt
a more youthful style.

00:56:31.951 --> 00:56:32.785
Why?

00:56:32.869 --> 00:56:34.746
Are you trying to change your look
to land a husband?

00:56:37.373 --> 00:56:39.334
Just shut up and do it for the money.

00:56:45.048 --> 00:56:45.924
First off,

00:56:47.884 --> 00:56:49.802
let's do something
about this lifeless hair.

00:56:58.519 --> 00:57:00.021
Hello there.

00:57:01.314 --> 00:57:03.024
So have you decided?

00:57:03.650 --> 00:57:04.484
I…

00:57:04.567 --> 00:57:07.195
Allow me to make a recommendation then.

00:57:07.278 --> 00:57:08.655
Just a moment.

00:57:08.738 --> 00:57:09.697
{\an8}HAIR STYLES FOR WOMEN IN 30S

00:57:11.658 --> 00:57:12.909
How about something like this?

00:57:13.493 --> 00:57:16.412
To accentuate the mature charm
of a woman in her thirties--

00:57:16.496 --> 00:57:17.497
She's 20.

00:57:18.665 --> 00:57:19.540
Pardon?

00:57:21.292 --> 00:57:22.585
I'm 20.

00:57:26.339 --> 00:57:27.674
Sure. Just a moment.

00:57:31.344 --> 00:57:34.180
This will accentuate the charm of Gen X.

00:57:34.264 --> 00:57:36.266
What do you think about this style?

00:57:36.349 --> 00:57:37.559
She'll go with that one.

00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:39.435
Sure.

00:57:39.519 --> 00:57:42.146
The final test happens
after the hair and makeup.

00:57:42.730 --> 00:57:43.648
The final test?

00:58:21.144 --> 00:58:22.979
FATEFUL ENCOUNTERS
VIDEOS, DVDS, COMICS, NOVELS

00:58:24.522 --> 00:58:28.901
I never fail to get carded
at movie theaters and video stores.

00:58:28.985 --> 00:58:32.405
You'll know you're passing for 20
when you get carded.

00:58:38.244 --> 00:58:39.704
Welcome.

00:58:39.787 --> 00:58:40.913
Hello.

00:58:43.875 --> 00:58:46.419
MUST BE 19 OR OVER TO RENT

00:58:52.258 --> 00:58:54.135
TO YOU FROM ME

00:59:38.137 --> 00:59:40.932
I really have to watch this tonight.

00:59:41.432 --> 00:59:42.850
You'll let me take it, won't you?

00:59:46.062 --> 00:59:47.188
No.

00:59:47.271 --> 00:59:49.732
I've also been waiting for tonight
for a long time.

00:59:53.152 --> 00:59:54.779
I grabbed it first.

00:59:55.863 --> 00:59:56.823
I don't think so.

00:59:57.657 --> 00:59:58.616
- Sir.
- Sir.

01:00:03.579 --> 01:00:05.164
{\an8}TO YOU FROM ME

01:00:17.051 --> 01:00:18.094
I'm going to

01:00:19.095 --> 01:00:21.597
need to check your ID, miss.

01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:24.475
This isn't meant for minors.

01:00:30.148 --> 01:00:32.859
I wish you a lovely,
passionate night by yourself.

01:00:36.070 --> 01:00:37.405
Hormones run rampant at your age.

01:00:40.116 --> 01:00:42.368
Was she talking about me?

01:00:46.998 --> 01:00:48.124
This is a masterpiece.

01:00:48.916 --> 01:00:49.792
It is.

01:00:50.543 --> 01:00:51.669
It's a masterpiece of film.

01:00:53.296 --> 01:00:54.756
It is with unbiased eyes.

01:01:01.304 --> 01:01:03.389
SEJIN HIGH SCHOOL

01:01:10.354 --> 01:01:13.566
1997 HANMIN RECRUITMENT WRITTEN EXAM
FOR FEMALE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES

01:01:17.945 --> 01:01:19.530

1997 HANMIN
FEMALE STAFF RECRUITMENT INTERVIEW

01:02:39.110 --> 01:02:42.613
{\an8}The top and bottom scorers
are interviewing together.

01:02:44.448 --> 01:02:47.869
Hong Jang-mi got 297 on the written exam.

01:02:50.663 --> 01:02:52.456
You only got the last
accounting question wrong.

01:02:53.666 --> 01:02:54.584
Meanwhile,

01:02:55.585 --> 01:02:59.046
Kang Eun-joo got a score of 210…

01:03:00.131 --> 01:03:01.382
I mean, 21 points.

01:03:05.052 --> 01:03:06.804
What's the point of interviewing?

01:03:06.888 --> 01:03:08.389
You should never hire the top scorer.

01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:12.018
What use would we have
with a young, smart woman?

01:03:13.144 --> 01:03:14.395
She's young but looks old.

01:03:15.104 --> 01:03:17.982
She'll never be carded on cigarette runs.

01:03:23.070 --> 01:03:24.989
- Ji-eun.
- Yes?

01:03:25.072 --> 01:03:27.366
You worked under Deputy Manager Kim.
I know him well.

01:03:27.450 --> 01:03:28.659
Yes, that's right.

01:03:28.743 --> 01:03:29.911
- Ms. Lee Eun-yeong?
- Yes?

01:03:29.994 --> 01:03:32.455
{\an8}Do you prefer it boneless
or with the bone?

01:03:32.538 --> 01:03:34.081
{\an8}- Ms. Seo Eun-su.
- Yes?

01:03:34.165 --> 01:03:35.541
{\an8}You're a former Miss Chunhyang?

01:03:35.625 --> 01:03:37.168
I was first runner-up.

01:03:37.251 --> 01:03:38.461
It's a pleasure to meet you.

01:03:57.188 --> 01:03:59.190
- Let's wrap up.
- Sure.

01:03:59.732 --> 01:04:00.775
Excuse me.

01:04:02.151 --> 01:04:04.987
I wasn't asked a single question.

01:04:05.696 --> 01:04:08.366
Candidate 504 next to me wasn't, either.

01:04:09.367 --> 01:04:10.242
You want a question?

01:04:13.496 --> 01:04:14.455
Bill Gates.

01:04:15.289 --> 01:04:16.707
You've heard of him, right?

01:04:17.667 --> 01:04:20.503
What is the name of the company
that Microsoft, led by Bill Gates,

01:04:20.586 --> 01:04:23.965
recently invested 150 million dollars in?

01:04:27.385 --> 01:04:28.344
Apple!

01:04:32.723 --> 01:04:34.558
It's Apple.

01:04:35.434 --> 01:04:39.397
Steve Jobs recently came back on as CEO.

01:04:41.774 --> 01:04:42.984
Ms. Kang Eun-joo,

01:04:43.067 --> 01:04:44.652
what a thoughtful response.

01:04:47.488 --> 01:04:48.614
You may all leave.

01:04:59.709 --> 01:05:00.584
Thank you.

01:05:14.932 --> 01:05:15.891
This way.

01:05:21.439 --> 01:05:22.398
Come on now.

01:05:23.983 --> 01:05:25.067
It's time to leave.

01:05:26.610 --> 01:05:29.196
I didn't get that last
accounting question wrong.

01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:31.949
The question itself was wrong.

01:05:33.075 --> 01:05:36.078
The answer wasn't in the multiple choice,
so I wrote it down separately.

01:05:44.587 --> 01:05:48.340
Please don't tell me
I was the only one who noticed

01:05:49.842 --> 01:05:51.093
the error in that question.

01:05:58.642 --> 01:06:00.770
MEETING ROOM
DO NOT ENTER

01:06:02.730 --> 01:06:06.025
She's just some 20-year-old
commercial high school grad.

01:06:06.108 --> 01:06:09.361
How dare she question
the accuracy of our data?

01:06:10.071 --> 01:06:12.823
The answer is 27.
It's not one of the choices.

01:06:12.907 --> 01:06:14.825
What? Seriously?

01:06:15.785 --> 01:06:19.038
The Research Division
is in charge of the exam questions.

01:06:19.121 --> 01:06:22.041
Ms. Go, you're in charge of proofreading.
Did you slack off?

01:06:22.124 --> 01:06:24.126
I submitted a report
noting a question error,

01:06:24.210 --> 01:06:26.504
along with the solution
and the correct answer.

01:06:27.088 --> 01:06:29.840
No, I've never received such a report.

01:06:30.758 --> 01:06:33.135
I guess Old Maid Go's mind is slipping.

01:06:33.886 --> 01:06:34.845
Have you gotten forgetful?

01:06:36.972 --> 01:06:39.058
Where did she write her answer though?

01:06:40.434 --> 01:06:41.936
P. S.

01:06:42.019 --> 01:06:45.272
Please conduct a thorough review
of exam questions next time.

01:06:46.065 --> 01:06:47.608
There.

01:07:01.163 --> 01:07:03.332
What should we do about Hong Jang-mi?

01:07:13.342 --> 01:07:14.969
Please input your exam ID number.

01:07:18.722 --> 01:07:20.891
Exam ID 505. Ms. Hong Jang-mi.

01:07:22.643 --> 01:07:24.061
Congratulations. You have passed.

01:07:25.479 --> 01:07:26.397
Damn straight.

01:07:35.364 --> 01:07:36.699
You've reached Hong Keum-bo.

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:45.875
Is this the X-file?

01:07:45.958 --> 01:07:48.002
The operation will last three months.

01:07:48.085 --> 01:07:50.337
We're the only ones
who know about this in the office.

01:07:50.963 --> 01:07:53.090
If things go awry,
I'll be shamed and forced to quit.

01:07:53.174 --> 01:07:54.592
I'll have to kiss my pension goodbye.

01:07:55.467 --> 01:07:56.302
I notified the office

01:07:56.385 --> 01:07:58.095
that you'll be on a long-term
business trip in the countryside.

01:08:00.931 --> 01:08:02.308
These are background check reports

01:08:02.391 --> 01:08:05.394
on the three Yehppee candidates
and President Kang's close acquaintances.

01:08:07.146 --> 01:08:09.106
Who's the new CEO of Hanmin?

01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:11.400
Is it Oh Deok-gyu,
Chairman Kang's son-in-law?

01:08:11.483 --> 01:08:14.236
I thought it'd be him too,
but apparently not.

01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:15.237
It's an external hire.

01:08:15.321 --> 01:08:18.449
- Who?
- I believe he's from overseas.

01:08:19.116 --> 01:08:20.117
Oh, I almost forgot.

01:08:20.993 --> 01:08:22.119
This is what you asked for.

01:08:25.206 --> 01:08:28.417

SEOUL CITY DORMITORY
FOR SINGLE FEMALE WORKERS

01:09:28.852 --> 01:09:31.939
Welcome to the Seoul City Dormitory
for Single Female Workers.

01:09:32.022 --> 01:09:33.524
We're happy you're here.

01:09:33.607 --> 01:09:36.110
You'll be required to pay
a deposit of 620,000 won

01:09:36.193 --> 01:09:38.028
and a monthly rent of 24,000 won.

01:09:39.238 --> 01:09:41.657
Eligibility is limited

01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:43.909
to unmarried women under 29

01:09:43.993 --> 01:09:49.164
who work in Seoul
and earn less than 15 million annually.

01:09:50.958 --> 01:09:54.253
We will do our very best
to provide a safe living environment

01:09:54.753 --> 01:09:58.299
until the day you're able to save up
and find a place of your own.

01:10:00.134 --> 01:10:01.135
However!

01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:07.224
All rules must be observed.

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:10.936
Curfew after midnight.

01:10:11.687 --> 01:10:14.189
No visitors allowed
under any circumstances.

01:10:15.149 --> 01:10:16.984
This is a women-only residence.

01:10:18.068 --> 01:10:19.028
Don't ever forget that.

01:10:21.405 --> 01:10:22.239
Applause.

01:10:38.964 --> 01:10:39.798
Hello.

01:10:40.966 --> 01:10:42.009
Room 301?

01:10:42.593 --> 01:10:43.594
Me too.

01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:46.180
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:10:46.722 --> 01:10:48.599
It's you, the top exam scorer!

01:10:52.436 --> 01:10:53.604
I'm Room 301 too.

01:10:54.772 --> 01:10:55.606
It's you,

01:10:55.689 --> 01:10:56.607
"Apple."

01:10:59.735 --> 01:11:01.862
They said each room
would have four people.

01:11:01.945 --> 01:11:03.572
Who are we missing?

01:11:04.073 --> 01:11:05.407
I heard earlier

01:11:05.908 --> 01:11:08.243
that everybody moved out
because of the queen bee here.

01:11:09.161 --> 01:11:11.622
I heard she works
at the head office as an assistant.

01:11:15.084 --> 01:11:17.461
Why do you even want to live in a dorm?

01:11:17.544 --> 01:11:18.796
Must you take it that far?

01:11:20.047 --> 01:11:23.634
The hidden link
between Yehppee and me lives there.

01:11:25.344 --> 01:11:26.512
The three Yehppee candidates are

01:11:26.595 --> 01:11:30.224
So Gyeong-dong,
Bang Jin-mok, and Cha Jung-il.

01:11:30.307 --> 01:11:31.392
YEHPPEE CANDIDATES

01:11:31.475 --> 01:11:32.851
President Kang

01:11:32.935 --> 01:11:35.646
communicated with Yehppee,
the whistleblower, at the office.

01:11:36.772 --> 01:11:39.233
He told me that his assistant
kept track of where he was

01:11:39.316 --> 01:11:41.235
and whom he met with at all times.

01:11:43.570 --> 01:11:46.073
So his assistant will have to know

01:11:46.156 --> 01:11:48.117
who Yehppee is.

01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:49.076
But

01:11:50.035 --> 01:11:52.746
I'm sure she doesn't know
that she's an important witness.

01:11:55.499 --> 01:11:57.084
GO BOK-HEE
PERSONAL ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT

01:11:57.167 --> 01:11:58.877
LIVES IN ROOM 301
AT THE FEMALE WORKERS' DORM

01:12:01.255 --> 01:12:02.172
Let's go inside.

01:12:06.802 --> 01:12:08.220
Who's Hong Keum-bo?

01:12:09.513 --> 01:12:12.057
"Hong Jang-mi's Outfit Inspiration Book
for a 20-Year-Old."

01:12:12.141 --> 01:12:15.018
From Hong Jang-mi.
To my sister, Hong Keum-bo.

01:12:27.448 --> 01:12:29.032
Why are you digging through my stuff?

01:12:29.616 --> 01:12:30.451
Wait.

01:12:32.119 --> 01:12:33.495
I know that face.

01:12:49.761 --> 01:12:53.557
{\an8}SPECIAL THANKS TO SHIN YU-NA
AND PARK JUNG-PYO FOR THEIR APPEARANCES

01:13:24.963 --> 01:13:26.882
{\an8}UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

01:13:27.382 --> 01:13:29.760
{\an8}Befriend that assistant
and just get the intel you need.

01:13:29.843 --> 01:13:31.178
{\an8}Then focus on finding Yehppee.

01:13:31.261 --> 01:13:32.221
{\an8}Hello.

01:13:32.304 --> 01:13:33.514
{\an8}I'm Hong Jang-mi.

01:13:33.597 --> 01:13:35.682
{\an8}Hey, Ms. Hong!
Commercial high! Uniform girl! You!

01:13:35.766 --> 01:13:37.309
{\an8}You'll deliver it safely and promptly.

01:13:38.602 --> 01:13:40.979
{\an8}I'm supposed to be
Ms. Go Bok-hee's successor?

01:13:41.063 --> 01:13:42.189
{\an8}You, lock the door.

01:13:42.272 --> 01:13:45.025
{\an8}Who says the new president
will have a new assistant?

01:13:45.901 --> 01:13:48.320
{\an8}I'm the newest member
of Hanmin Investment & Securities,

01:13:48.403 --> 01:13:49.238
{\an8}Shin Jung-woo.

01:13:49.321 --> 01:13:51.323
{\an8}If I'd known
that Shin Jung-woo would be joining,

01:13:51.406 --> 01:13:54.076
{\an8}I'd never have set foot in Hanmin,
undercover my ass.

01:13:54.159 --> 01:13:55.536
You know him?

01:13:55.619 --> 01:13:57.996
And shared a passionate romance?

01:13:59.623 --> 01:14:04.628
