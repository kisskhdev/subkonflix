WEBVTT

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.480
Move it

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.280
Move

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:37.920
Since Ma the Tiger took charge,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.280
we haven't kidnapped any women.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.790
Now we've snatched two at once.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.040
I'm afraid there'll be trouble.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.280
What are you scared of?

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.150
Ma the Tiger is human,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.400
and we're human too, aren't we?

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.230
Exactly.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.480
We envy Ma the Tiger having fun every day.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.870
We gotta satisfy our cravings too.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.950
Move.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.230
Move.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.480
These two clearly aren't

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.070
cheap goods from a brothel.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.070
Haven't tasted fresh goods like this in ages.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.640
Move.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.430
You're so fair.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.520
Don't come over!

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.150
Good fellows...

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.310
we're here to find someone.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:18.470
Did you hear that?

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.840
She called us good fellows.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.280
We'll find him for you in bed.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.400
Don't come any closer!

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:26.560
If you come closer...

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.280
I'll die right in front of you!

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.840
It'd be a shame if you died.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.590
That's right.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.680
Don't come over!

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:33.710
Don't come over!

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.310
I just love this type.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.030
Who's screaming about dying out here?

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.360
What a racket.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.560
Yu Zhen!

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.470
Xiu Gu!

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.120
Sha'er!

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.280
I finally found you.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.680
Why did you...

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.560
run off all by yourself?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.960
You've been gone so long

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.680
without a single word.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.000
I couldn't eat or sleep well.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.280
Fan Bao said he saw you,

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.400
so I came to find you right away.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.080
Let me see. Let me see.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:10.630
Why are you holding this?

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:11.870
This isn't suitable for you.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.120
Let me look at you.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.240
It's still my Yu Zhen.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.870
It's really my Yu Zhen.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.710
From now on,

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.590
don't leave me alone again.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.240
I won't. I won't.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.590
I never want to be apart from you again.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.190
I won't.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.280
We won't be apart.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.560
Absolutely won't be apart.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.590
Boss Ma,

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:34.800
let me introduce you.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.430
This is my Wife.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.910
So it's you.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.360
And who are you?

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.630
I am...

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.080
Xiu Gu.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.360
Are you a relative of his?

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.150
No.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:57.280
A friend?

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.520
No.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.190
Since you're neither...

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.150
Do you know what place this is?

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.240
And you still dare to come?

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.870
Then I'll take her...

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.560
...and reward her to the brothers.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.120
Thank you, Boss Ma.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.710
Great! Great!

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:13.870
Stop yelling!

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.310
What a racket.

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.750
You can't do that.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.750
Why not?

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.960
Just wait a moment.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.190
Yu Zhen.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.870
During the time I've been away...

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.950
...I've been with Xiu Gu the whole time.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:30.800
The two of us...

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:33.480
Huh?

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.270
Could you...

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.750
Huh?

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.560
Is it possible for her...

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.270
Oh.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.240
I want to marry Brother Fan.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.240
Didn't you say...

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.070
...you only love Yu Zhen?

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:53.750
Didn't you say...

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.680
...you'd be willing to die for her?

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.430
I thought...

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.070
...you were devoted to your wife...

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.600
...for your whole life.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.000
But you still want a concubine.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.070
Men are all the same.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.680
Phony and hypocritical.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.800
That's not absolute.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.000
There are exceptions.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.390
Since you want to marry...

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:18.920
...then marry me too.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.720
That won't do.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.870
You haven't forgotten...

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.510
...what happened that night, have you?

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.430
That night...

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.510
...we didn't do anything at all.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.190
You know which night I'm talking about.

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.830
Seems you do remember.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.720
Senior Brother.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:40.720
Say something.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.310
Although I really want to believe you...

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.870
...I have to believe Boss Ma.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:50.510
Scarface.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:51.800
What are you laughing at?

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.070
A grown man should own up to his actions.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.270
Troublemaker.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:00.680
Yu Zhen, Xiu Gu.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.360
Don't worry.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.240
She and I...

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.510
...really didn't do anything at all.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:07.070
Sha'er.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:08.950
Whether you did or not...

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.430
...you're coming back with me.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:12.800
We're going back to Weiyuan.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.870
Everything here...

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.040
...I don't care about any of it.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:17.870
Brother Fan.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.000
The Huos killed my father.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.190
I had no choice but to come find you.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.390
Your father died?

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.310
Let's go.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.040
Down the mountain.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.680
Trying to leave again?

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:32.830
What?

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:34.190
What?

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.600
I won't go! I won't go!

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.480
Just let the two of them go.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.270
Can't you two have some backbone?

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.870
He's out there living free and easy.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.360
While you stay home living like widows.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.270
Do you want to rely on him that much?

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:50.830
I am his wife.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.240
I know him.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.000
He never belonged here to begin with.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:55.430
Please let us go.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.000
I promise that once we're out,

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.070
about the things here,

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.120
we won't say a word.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.360
You enter my stronghold and think you can leave?

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.560
Not likely.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.720
Sister Yu Zhen, don't beg her.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:07.120
Kill or torture us as you please.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.000
To walk the road to the underworld with Brother Fan,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.920
I'm actually not afraid.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.720
My father is waiting down there too.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.360
You sure talk tough.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.600
Then I'll grant your wish.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.310
Don't believe her.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:18.510
She's just talking nonsense.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.070
Don't believe her?

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:22.240
Can't bear to lose this one, huh?

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:23.160
Then what about this one?

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.750
Boss Ma.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:29.600
What is it?

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.070
One gun,

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.000
pointing at two defenseless, weak women.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.480
What is the meaning of this?

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.000
Those two are weak women.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.600
Then what about me?

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.870
In my heart, you are

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:42.120
a woman like a little bird.

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:44.360
Don't get so excited.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.240
Let's talk this over nicely.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:46.360
Move aside.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.680
I've already pulled my gun out.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:52.630
If someone doesn't die today,

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.510
my hand will be itching.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:57.480
Fine.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.160
If someone really has to die,

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:00.920
then kill me.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.360
Playing the hero saving the beauty, huh?

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:04.360
Then I'll grant your wish.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.240
If you're going to kill him,

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:06.630
then kill me along with him.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.120
I don't want to live alone either.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.510
You two silly women.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:11.510
You're devoted to him heart and soul,

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:13.750
but he splits his heart in two.

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:15.510
Even I feel it's unfair for you.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:17.240
How about this?

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:18.680
We get rid of him,

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.560
and you two follow me.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.270
In the future, if there are handsome ones,

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:23.560
fit ones,

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.600
young ones,

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:25.680
you can take your pick.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.950
There are plenty of good days ahead.

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:29.950
Why hang yourself on a single tree?

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.560
You insist that one of us must die.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.720
It's just because you want to tear us apart.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:37.920
Because you are jealous.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.030
Me? Jealous?

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:41.870
Is there anything I can't get?

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:44.080
Actually, you don't understand at all.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.030
True love

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.840
is not selfish.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:49.390
Don't push your luck.

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:53.840
Yu Zhen, stop talking.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.030
Do you understand?

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.600
I live at the river's head

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.750
You live at the river's end

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.000
Day after day I think of you but cannot see you

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.630
We drink from the same river water

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.150
When will this water cease?

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.030
When will this sorrow end?

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:24.270
I only wish your heart were like mine

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.080
And will be true to my love

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.320
I don't know what you're saying

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.750
But I can guess what you want to say

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:39.910
You people

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.440
really aren't afraid to die

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:44.390
It's not death that I fear

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.550
I fear never seeing him again

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:51.120
I understand those words

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:54.750
I get it

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:56.510
I get it

00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:59.150
I know it all

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.360
Should we help them?

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.750
Are we just going to watch them die?

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:05.390
Just say the word, and we'll attack

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.750
Big Brother

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.790
I've been here all along

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:10.360
Ma the Tiger

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.080
I like you

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:13.960
Shut up

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:15.080
No, I won't

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.480
I know your ruthlessness is just a disguise

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:23.320
I know

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.750
You act like a man

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.360
because you're afraid of being bullied

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:28.440
Shut up

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:31.360
I know

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:33.630
You've always been wearing a mask

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.910
If you don't want to take it off

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:38.030
I'll stay by your side

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.030
Until the day you get tired

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:43.030
I will keep you safe

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:45.790
I told you to shut up

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:47.790
Others laugh at me for being too crazy

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:49.480
I laugh at them for not seeing the truth

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.150
Ma the Tiger

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:54.630
I love you

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.150
I said shut the hell up

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:08.320
I didn't want to hurt you

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:11.150
Tell them to let those two women go

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:12.630
Today, none of you

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.000
will escape

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.440
Let go

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:17.840
Let go! Let go! Let go!

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:21.720
Ma the Tiger

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.240
Who fired that shot?

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.120
Ma the Tiger

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.200
Ma the Tiger

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:42.550
Ma the Tiger

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:46.120
Actually

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:48.960
I died a long time ago

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.790
That night

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.790
what I told you

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:58.080
was all true

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:11.600
It was him

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.200
Avenge

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.840
me

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:17.910
Okay

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.480
I will avenge you

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.080
Let's meet

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:30.840
in the next life

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.200
Remember

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.240
to braid my hair

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.000
into two pigtails

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:48.270
Ma the Tiger

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:56.750
Ma the Tiger

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:11.910
Commander Qin, you're visiting my humble home.

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:13.480
Why didn't you let me know beforehand?

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:15.240
So I could have prepared some tea.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.630
I'm not here to drink tea.

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:18.480
Then what brings you here, Commander?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:19.840
Let me ask you.

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:22.240
Did you have anything to do with Dong Jiuguan's death?

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.200
Who died?

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:24.670
Dong Jiuguan.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.790
Hasn't Dong Jiuguan always been under

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:28.550
your care, Commander Qin?

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:29.870
How could he have died?

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:33.870
Don't you beat around the bush with me.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:35.790
Commander Qin.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:37.510
You're wrongly accusing me.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.030
Although I had a grudge against him before,

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.510
I did promise you

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:43.600
that I wouldn't pursue it anymore.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:44.600
But surely you can't,

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.080
just because I had a grudge against him,

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:47.630
blame me for everything

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:49.150
that happens to him later.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.150
Our Huo Family's caravan

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.720
was robbed by bandits.

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:55.550
We suffered heavy losses.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.550
Recently, our young master

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:00.080
has been staying up all night trying

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.870
to fill this financial hole.

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:03.720
How could we have the energy

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.750
to get up to anything else?

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:07.150
Exactly.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.510
And what about that Xiu Gu?

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:10.000
Is she doing well?

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:11.960
She hasn't gone off to collude with bandits, has she?

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.320
Listen, Huo.

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:15.440
Just because I didn't catch Fan,

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.150
you think you can cut off my income?

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.030
You're really ruthless.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.120
Commander Qin.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.000
If you don't have evidence,

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.510
you shouldn't make wild accusations.

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:27.630
How would our Huo Family dare do that?

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:35.200
Show him out.

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:54.910
What do we do now?

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.840
There are only two ways.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.870
Either the one who killed the boss becomes the boss,

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:00.440
or we kill the one who killed the boss,

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.480
and pick a new boss.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:03.080
I think the first way works.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.390
That's how royal usurpations have always been.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.120
I don't think that works.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.440
Later on, anyone who wants to be boss will kill the boss.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:11.030
Who would respect the boss then?

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:13.080
Sha'er.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:14.670
What should we do now?

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.720
We can't leave now.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.550
Everyone, let me say a few words.

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:23.600
What happened today,

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.910
everyone saw with their own eyes.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.080
Boss Ma actually attacked Big Brother.

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:29.910
As for us,

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.870
she could take our lives at any moment.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.550
Scarface firing that shot,

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:35.790
I think it got us out of a tight spot.

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:37.600
Ma the Tiger's death,

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.440
must have been an accident.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.670
My woman died,

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.720
and you just brush it off like that?

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:46.840
No,

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.320
since when did she become your woman?

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:51.480
She asked me to comb her braid.

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:54.030
Did you hear that?

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.480
Did you all hear that?

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:01.480
She asked me to comb her braid.

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:03.320
That means she accepted me.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.600
As her man,

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.030
I must kill the one who shot her in the back.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.840
Come on! Do it! Let's see who kills who!

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.360
Come on! Come!

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.720
Alright, alright, put it down first.

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:16.510
Stop provoking him.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:17.840
Big Brother.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.390
I'm sworn brothers with him.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.550
Since we are brothers,

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:23.510
you two should be brothers too.

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:25.240
You can't touch him.

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:26.870
I didn't swear an oath with him.

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:28.600
I am Ma the Tiger's man.

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:30.000
I speak for her.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.030
Well, I'm still the strategist.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.840
I'm still in charge of you all.

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:35.440
Ma the Tiger is dead.

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:37.030
You're no longer the strategist.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.030
Put it down.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.720
If I don't count as the strategist,

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:43.870
you don't count either.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:44.840
Who's in charge then?

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.550
A bunch of grown men, fussing like old women.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.390
Why not just fight it out?

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.320
Whoever wins becomes the boss.

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:52.320
That's right.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.790
Pick one to be the boss for now.

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:54.600
Exactly.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.120
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.120
I'll do it.

00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:59.750
If I win,

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:01.120
he becomes the boss.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.240
You punk.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:03.480
You can't.

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:05.390
Your wounds haven't healed yet.

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:07.000
How could you possibly win?

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:07.840
Sit down.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.360
Then I'll make the call.

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:12.590
I'll do it.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.480
Sha'er, you can't go.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:19.720
Sister Yu Zhen.

00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:20.920
Don't worry.

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:21.960
He can do it.

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:23.030
Good.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.110
You come.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:27.790
Big Brother, be careful.

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:37.070
Heaven is big, earth is big,

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.640
brothers are the biggest.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.000
Mountains are high, waters are deep,

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:56.350
brotherly love is deep.

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:02.720
Hearts open and true,

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.550
sharing glory and shame.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.720
Brothers united in heart,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.920
can cut through metal.

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.480
Heaven is big, earth is big,

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.110
aren't brothers the biggest?

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:50.960
Yes!

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:01.200
Me and my brothers,

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.920
bow to Heaven, Earth, and Guangong.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.830
I won't say more.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:14.790
You remember,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.590
we are always good brothers.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.110
Walking the Jianghu, what matters most?

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:24.640
Righteousness.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.550
Righteousness matters most.

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:54.070
How do we score this?

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.030
It's a draw. It's a tie.

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:57.350
Then who gets to be the boss?

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.200
Two bosses.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.030
If I become the boss...

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.510
on future missions,

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:09.070
I'll lead the charge.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.350
If I become the boss...

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:14.920
I'll take the brothers down for wine and women regularly.

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:16.880
If I become the boss...

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:20.200
the brothers will feast on the best every day.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.070
In a word...

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:24.550
Food? You'll eat your fill.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.110
Wine? You'll drink your fill.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.590
Women? You get first pick.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:30.750
Good! Good!

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:32.160
Senior Brother, I support you!

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:33.590
Good! Good! Good!

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:34.920
Senior Brother, we support you!

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:35.640
Support you!

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:36.550
Support you!

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:38.160
Your turn.

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:41.000
Big Brother.

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:42.030
Rise up!

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:49.000
You'd better hit the gong.

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:54.480
Bandits...

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.680
are like rats on the street; everyone wants to kill us.

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:02.550
We...

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.070
bear the stigma of being bandits.

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:07.480
We hide from soldiers and militias.

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:09.720
We can't care for our parents...

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.310
in their old age or bury them.

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:14.350
Nor can we raise our wives and children.

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:18.240
You can't even find a *wife*, can you?

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:22.070
It looks glorious...

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:25.400
but we could lose our lives at any moment.

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:26.680
These things...

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:30.110
we know them all too well.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:33.350
What should we do?

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:35.030
We must change.

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:38.110
We must turn from dark to light.

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:41.030
We must stop sneaking around and live openly.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.790
Who among us isn't...

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:44.830
a man of flesh and blood?

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.510
Who doesn't want to achieve...

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:47.920
something great and heroic?

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.720
From now on...

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
I will share weal and woe with you all.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.270
We'll live with dignity...

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:57.590
and act with integrity.

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:55.160
Go on.

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:16.720
Today...

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:17.830
Get down, get down, get down.

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:18.920
The hat looks bad.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:23.960
This hat is perfect.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:24.790
Looks good.

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.350
Really?

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:34.270
Today...

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.070
we are no longer bandits.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:39.880
The banner of our Brotherhood...

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:41.510
has been raised.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.550
We must set the rules first.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.920
Disloyalty and unfilial piety bring retribution.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:59.030
Cruelty and injustice mean death.

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:01.830
Betraying brothers means beheading.

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:04.590
Cursing parents means cutting out the tongue.

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:07.720
Break the law and you castrate yourself.

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.000
Rapists and bullies face the blade.

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:14.510
Backstabbers will be executed.

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.110
Betraying guests is unforgivable.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.200
Corrupting morals is a sin you can't escape.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.030
Look...

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:26.240
that's all I can think of for now.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:27.830
When I think of more...

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.000
I'll add them.

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:32.160
Everyone must memorize this.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.350
Good.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.350
Two braids. Looks good.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.590
I live at the river's head

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.960
You live at the river's end

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:10.920
Day after day I think of you but cannot see you

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:14.110
We drink from the same river water

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.510
When will this water cease?

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:21.550
When will this sorrow end?

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.350
I only wish your heart is like mine

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.750
And I will be true to my love

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:39.640
That's right

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.880
We're going to have a good life

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:46.310
Are you planning

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:48.030
to settle down here for good?

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.960
This is a lawless zone

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:52.350
We can do whatever we want

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.830
We'll live free and easy

00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:57.350
So, in the future

00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.000
you're not going back to the Fan family?

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:01.350
Great-Uncle is at home

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:03.750
I don't need to worry about him

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.350
Great-Uncle doesn't even know you're still alive

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:08.160
He's getting old

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.160
You should go back and do your filial duty

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.310
I haven't even warmed my throne yet

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:16.350
Haven't had the chance to show off my power

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:19.350
Fan Bao is at home

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:21.030
He's more filial than I am

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.160
What's wrong?

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:28.830
You're unhappy?

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:38.480
Yu Zhen, let's have some fun

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:51.070
Did you miss me?

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:00.070
Okay

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.440
I'll go sleep outside

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.720
You go to bed early

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.310
Don't catch a cold

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.000
Brother Fan, why are you here?

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:28.510
Why are you still unhappy even after becoming the boss?

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.880
I'm the boss now

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.510
Who am I afraid of?

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:39.200
You look so handsome as the boss

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:41.640
Let me tell you

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:44.200
Before, if I wanted to do anything

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:46.960
I had to watch other people's moods

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:49.590
Now I can finally call the shots myself

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:51.680
Your father

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.750
died saving Yu Zhen

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.480
I will definitely find a way to get revenge

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:01.270
You should go spend more time with Sister Yu Zhen

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.440
I'll go tomorrow

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.400
You haven't seen each other for so long

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.510
Right

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.550
You're right

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:41.750
Darn it

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:08.590
Hello, Sister-in-law

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:11.830
What is this for?

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.000
Taking you home

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:16.110
Really?

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.240
Everything is ready

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:19.640
Just waiting for you

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:22.310
So many people

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:23.590
are going back with us?

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:25.830
This is called returning home in glory

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:28.270
You should probably keep a low profile

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:30.030
Don't scare Great-Uncle

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:32.200
I just want Great-Uncle

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.200
to see that I've made something of myself

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.110
Then I'll go pack

00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:39.590
Pack what?

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.200
Let's just go

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.350
There's everything at home

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.240
Xiu Gu, you take that sedan chair

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:46.000
Quick

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:47.350
You take this one

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.830
Ready

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:53.880
Lift the sedan

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.400
Leave the palace

00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:57.750
What do you mean "leave the palace"?

00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:58.920
You're dreaming

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.480
Move out

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:02.720
Move out

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:26.350
Okay

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:28.440
From now on

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:30.960
we have a home and food to eat

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.720
Good
