00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.910
Ying Du,

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.200
what's wrong with you?

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.110
Are you all right?

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.520
Your body's cold as ice.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.320
I've never seen symptoms like this.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.760
(Such grave wounds.)

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.920
(Did the Grand Princess punish him)

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.790
(for taking me away?)

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.320
(Or was he)

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.400
(hunted down when he escaped?)

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.150
Your wounds

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.560
are hidden beneath your clothes.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.280
I'll help you

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.560
take off your clothes first,

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.040
so I can treat the surface injuries.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.640
Don't touch me.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.280
Stop right now.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.310
Alright, stop moving around.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.910
Zhaoli?

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.950
Weren't you trying to escape?

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.500
If they find you, you'll be in danger.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.340
Hurry.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.350
Here we go.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:58.710
Zhaoli?

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.760
Are you here?

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.870
I've lived so many years;

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.360
no one has ever stuffed me
into a wardrobe.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.000
Che,

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.190
you're finally back.

00:02:13.201 --> 00:02:14.932
You've been away cultivating
for six years.

00:02:14.943 --> 00:02:16.310
I've waited for you so long.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.680
Still,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.080
the moment you return,

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.000
you only care about finding Zhaoli.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.870
Zhaoli is my betrothed.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.240
Now that I'm back,

00:02:26.251 --> 00:02:28.224
of course she's the first person
I wish to see.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.840
He's your betrothed?

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:33.960
Quiet.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.590
Che,

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.190
you don't know

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.870
Zhaoli has someone else now?

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.630
She says he's her husband.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.470
They act quite close,

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.870
without any concern for others.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.360
Zhaoli

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.680
is already married?

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.430
Yes.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:01.680
Che,

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.430
perhaps Zhaoli is spending time

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.470
with her husband right now.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.430
He seems to have deep feelings for you.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.080
Do you feel the same for him?

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.520
Come on, I'll tell you

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.400
what happened today.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.870
It was just a childhood game.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.000
Nothing to take seriously.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.910
You don't like him?

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.560
Then who is your husband?

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.240
What does that have to do with you?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.750
Why are my wounds healed?

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:54.960
What's going on?

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.400
You can cast spells?

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.240
You can even heal wounds.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.280
Who exactly are you?

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.000
Why are you so powerful?

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.150
And this bracelet...

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.910
You must know how to use it.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.310
Right?

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:20.160
What are you doing?

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.696
Isn't this what you wanted?

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:24.920
Let me show you how it works.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.600
Perfect!

00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:34.630
Now I can finally find out

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:35.916
who the husband in my dreams is.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.170
It might turn out

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.510
to be a destined match.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.520
Dreams?

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.720
So, the husband you spoke of

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.480
never existed at all.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.190
Even if it's just a dream,

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.390
I dream of it every single day.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.630
That makes it real to me.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.800
Besides, I've asked about it.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.120
It's a foretelling dream.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.430
It will surely happen.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:04.870
I can't see a thing.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.270
Let alone your foretelling dream.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.870
Your past life must be complex.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.600
Even the Bracelet can't read you.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:14.950
Why would this happen?

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.120
(Is she disheartened?)

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.480
(Why can she)

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.120
(take away my Frost Seal)

00:05:33.386 --> 00:05:34.830
(and share a spiritual link with me?)

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.480
(Is it a mere coincidence,)

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:37.830
(or is she connected)

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.510
(to the Saintess Xihe I'm looking for?)

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.360
Your Majesty.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.150
Your Majesty.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.456
(Luo Cheng, Ying Du's aide)
She took your Frost Seal.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.070
It's draining your power.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.040
The Curse has worsened.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.120
His entire body feels like ice.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.310
It might be a cold poison.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.870
Isn't Flame Grass said
to counter cold poisons?

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.870
Flame Grass.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.630
It's a highly toxic herb,

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.560
growing near the roots
of the old pagoda tree.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.600
If picked improperly,

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.170
one could easily

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.030
lose

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.960
one's life.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.190
Too dangerous.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.630
Should I go or not?

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.120
Maybe I shouldn't go.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.870
Your Majesty, let's return.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.830
If anything happens to you here...

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.720
I'll stay until the Frost Seal
is recovered.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.600
Bring all my belongings here.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:51.880
- But...
- Enough.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.160
(Given the situation,)

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.070
(I'm afraid I must kill that healer.)

00:06:59.213 --> 00:07:01.142
(Only then can the ruler
reclaim the Frost Seal)

00:07:01.153 --> 00:07:02.630
(and restore his power.)

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:39.870
This woman...

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:41.360
She's actually...

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.200
(Dreaming of her husband again.)

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.310
(Would she do that once asleep?)

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.360
(Even I start feeling stirred
because of her.)
