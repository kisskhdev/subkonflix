[Born to Be Alive]

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.160
[Episode 33]

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.310
The worst case back then

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.539
was County Mayor Duojie.

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:47.200
You know about that too?

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:48.570
Yes.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.950
When his condition was at its worst,

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.950
he came to our hospital for an X-ray.

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.509
I was the attending doctor.

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:55.620
I remember it clearly.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.360
The X-ray back then showed

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.039
he had bone spur formations.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.810
So,

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.440
can the medical records and X-rays

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.740
still be found?

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.410
They should still be

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.280
in the County Hospital archives.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.180
But it's been so many years.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.500
I'm not sure if they're still there.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.900
I'll check for you later.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.430
Okay.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.970
I've been busy lately

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.060
and can't look after you.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.820
Grandma has a bad back,

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.579
so she can't pick you up from school.

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:26.250
After school,

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.410
go to Grandma's house by yourself.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.930
Okay.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.000
Your dad will take you to school tomorrow.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.030
You haven't been fighting lately,
have you?

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.370
Who fights anymore?

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.960
I get along so well

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:38.970
with Sun Luowen now.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.100
We're best friends.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.470
Who is Sun Yiwen?

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.130
The one who pulled my pigtails.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.300
I've told you so many times.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.430
You never remember.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.190
Erzi's Mom!

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.970
Bring the big wooden basin

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.500
over to me.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:04.690
My goodness.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.340
I really caught this wave.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.440
The Provincial Commission and Provincial Government

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.840
have always prioritized

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.400
ecological protection,

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:13.490
especially

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.510
since the 18th National Congress.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.240
The wooden basin was placed in the yard,

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.250
and filled with water.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.300
and pour the fish down.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.370
The meeting proposed

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.020
that prioritizing ecological protection

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.840
must be implemented in all aspects.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.000
When development

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.450
conflicts with protection,

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.420
we must never sacrifice the ecology

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.860
and environment

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.520
for temporary economic growth.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.780
Don't move. Sit still.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.950
Regarding increasing protection

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.820
for the Bolamula Nature Reserve,

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.340
and comprehensively rectifying
and regulating

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.740
the development order
of the Tianduo Coal Field,

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.950
a series of measures were proposed.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.640
In response
to national environmental policies,

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.920
the provincial committee and the provincial government

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.650
[Qinghai Provincial People's Government]

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.710
to impose a comprehensive mining ban

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.970
on all coal mines
in the Tianduo Coalfield.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.910
The billions in mining rights involved

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.640
will be completely withdrawn.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.010
This is not just

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.010
an ordinary administrative order.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.370
It is a self-revolution

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.160
in Qinghai's environmental history.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.500
It is an ecological responsibility
Qinghai shoulders

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.770
for the nation and all of humanity.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.089
When the mining pits fall silent,

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.290
and the slag heaps are covered
by green grass,

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.390
I suddenly understood.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.660
The Bolamula

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.220
that I've been dreaming of.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.180
Those days and nights
of patrolling the mountains.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.320
They turned out to be just the prologue

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.200
to this ecological awakening.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:34.930
And today,

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.700
our efforts

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:39.300
will finally find their answer

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.150
in the surging of the Three Rivers.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.600
The provincial committee and provincial government

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.830
have approved

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.520
the Implementation Plan

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:50.840
for the Comprehensive Rectification

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.300
of the Tianduo Coal Field.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.220
[Secretary of Municipal Council of Zhongqu, Li Jianjun]

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.620
Effective immediately,

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.659
mining operations in all zones

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.450
of the Tianduo Coal Field

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:59.450
must stop at once.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.430
All enterprises

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.500
must complete the aftermath work
as soon as possible

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.900
and withdraw gradually.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.720
Relevant departments will organize forces

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.600
to carry out cinder cleanup,

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:11.710
slope management,

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.270
pit backfilling,

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.210
and grassland regreening

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.600
in all mining areas.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.010
After the coal mine closed,

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.430
the capital income

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.520
will definitely be reduced.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.190
The impact is multifaceted,

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:30.950
But environmental protection

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.240
is the trend.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.000
I hope everyone

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.390
does not pit economic development

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.450
against environmental protection.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:39.980
We must deeply recognize

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.490
the ecological status of Qinghai Province.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.470
Prioritizing ecological protection

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.409
is a vital spirit

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.720
that must be resolutely implemented

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.250
from the state

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.670
down to the local level.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.120
Everyone

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.930
must take a responsible attitude

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.060
toward the country,

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:55.330
the people,

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.690
and future generations

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.950
to complete the important task

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.680
of environmental protection.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.260
Comrade Lin Peisheng.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.840
Comrades.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.360
The city currently

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.950
has five coal mines.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.000
Distributed among them are

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.450
19 slag hills

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:18.800
and 11 mining pits

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.480
of varying depths.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.080
Considering that carrying out
ecological restoration projects

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.880
in high-altitude mining areas

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.510
is a national first,

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:30.740
and there is no successful experience

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.540
to draw upon,

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.450
regarding how to improve the soil,

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.420
what grass varieties to choose,

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.250
and what the survival rate will be,

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:39.040
we all have to

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.380
feel our way forward.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.510
We have formed an expert group

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.800
to work with us

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.480
to draw up a treatment plan.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:46.310
In addition,

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.480
after much consideration and discussion,

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.360
we believe

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.430
we can select

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.820
one or two enterprises

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.110
to take charge of the regreening.

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:55.540
The enterprises must have advantages
in capital,

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.310
technology,

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.960
and personnel.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.900
We can better coordinate

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.190
all aspects of the work

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.070
to ensure the regreening project
proceeds smoothly.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:07.880
Manager Bai.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.330
A comprehensive mining ban.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:13.220
So we’re shutting it down completely?

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.420
Is that what you mean?

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.150
That's exactly what it means.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:17.950
The policy has been handed down.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.580
There are no other possibilities.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.700
Shutting down completely?

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:21.750
So everyone's unemployed now?

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:22.660
As for my old employees,

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:23.960
I won't even mention them.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.310
But the mine just hired

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:26.870
a dozen professionals this year.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:28.640
All the postgraduates and undergraduates

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.730
have to go back?

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:31.750
Is Tianduo City going to shut down?

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.480
The sky is falling.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.130
Do you think this is just
corporate downsizing?

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:37.480
It's useless complaining to me here.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.230
This is the general trend.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.250
Forget about old or new employees.

00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:43.200
Right now, whether the entire Xinhai

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:43.810
can survive

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:45.010
is the real question.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.520
Go back to the salt field.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:13.190
Forget it.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.140
Don't become a target,

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.140
nor block the way.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.350
Wait until the storm passes.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:20.270
Especially regarding those

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:21.420
small mine owners.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.120
Pay them what's owed as soon as possible

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.220
and appease them.

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:26.810
Don't let anyone get a handle on you.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.500
The city's current policy

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.230
is to have a smooth transition.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:30.860
And your Xinhai

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.110
is the key focus.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.390
Director Huang,

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:35.510
how much I've done over the years,

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:36.890
you know the truth.

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:38.120
You're really acting like

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:38.909
you use people when you need them

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:40.620
and discard them when you don't.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:41.820
Key focus, huh?

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:42.770
Fine.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.470
Should I invite the comrades
from the Discipline Inspection Commission

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:45.930
to come check my books too?

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.970
Feng Keqing!

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:49.390
You're just looking for someone to blame,
aren't you?

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:50.070
The mining ban

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:51.600
is an order
from the provincial government.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.000
How can you expect

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:52.790
a low-ranking division-level official

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:53.480
to stop it?

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.760
I don't care if it's from the province

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:55.520
or anywhere.

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:57.180
Anyway, Xinhai can't stop.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:01.240
Let me tell you something.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.700
During the meeting today,

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:03.870
Lin Peisheng brought up

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:05.270
the regreening project.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:06.860
If this thing is done well,

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.640
everyone can benefit from it.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.320
What do you mean?

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:11.170
Regreening?

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.470
What can you earn from planting grass?

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:14.780
You want me to plant cows?

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:15.850
What's the rush?

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.240
Are you stupid

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.040
after digging coal these years?

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:23.290
Who told you

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.790
environmental protection is charity?

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:26.410
Environmental protection
is an engineering project.

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:27.670
Do you understand now?

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.070
It's so exhausting talking to you.

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:35.580
Zhuling.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:38.000
Stop doing. Time to eat.

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:38.620
Come here.

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.860
Stop, stop.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:43.150
Dad, actually, I'm not very hungry.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.400
You're not fat.
You don't need to lose weight.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.130
Stop doing your homework.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:47.170
No.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:48.350
After school,

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.000
Sun Luowen and I

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.190
went to get roasted buns.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:51.070
His treat.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:53.490
Then you don't have to eat.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:54.290
Don't have it.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.740
You'll get indigestion if you eat more.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:57.160
Here.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:58.200
Look.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.030
I kept something up his sleeve.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:03.600
Is it good?

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:04.750
It's good.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:06.880
I didn't use sugar.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:07.680
I added honey.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.030
You're amazing.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:09.620
Right?

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:10.550
I think so too.

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:11.960
This smoothie,

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.270
it's my first time making it.

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:13.820
Can you taste

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:15.030
what's in it?

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.010
No.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:16.550
I was talking about

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:17.800
Sun Luowen and I.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.080
I realized that

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.050
if I talk to him nicely,

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:21.190
he understands.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:21.740
There's no need

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.800
to get physical over a disagreement.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:24.740
Right. You can't.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.200
Dad, add some honey for me.

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:26.900
Let me tell you.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:27.840
Your personality

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.040
takes after your mom.

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.260
Too impatient. Like a hedgehog.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:31.960
But sometimes,

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.360
when people interact...

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:37.490
Actually, relationships

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.010
can't be rushed.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:40.720
You have to take it slow.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:42.480
Look at me, a while ago

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.980
work wasn't going well for me.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:44.780
I was anxious.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:45.620
But later,

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.150
once the environmental policy

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:47.150
was implemented,

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:48.810
everything got better.

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:49.310
Right?

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.200
What's wrong?

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:53.860
Zhuling.

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:57.440
What did you

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:58.350
put in there?

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:04.720
How is she?

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:07.340
It's

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.720
acute urticaria.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:10.740
What did you give her?

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.070
We gave her

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:13.180
Dexamethasone.

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:15.070
Fortunately,

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:16.110
I didn't put much mango

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:17.040
in the smoothie.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.410
If she had gone into anaphylactic shock,

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:19.940
it would have been serious.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:26.440
When Zhuling
just started elementary school,

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.250
Bai Shao sent a box

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:28.510
of mangoes from Guangzhou.

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:30.450
She had an allergic reaction
after eating them

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:31.430
and was hospitalized for a week.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:32.290
Did you forget?

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:33.890
Did you forget?

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:37.540
Sorry.

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:38.970
I'm sorry.

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:48.780
Shao Yunfei.

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.430
I misspoke earlier.

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:54.140
I know

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.850
you are a competent reporter.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:58.460
But you really aren't

00:11:58.460 --> 00:11:59.590
a competent father.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:03.670
But in life,

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.200
you can't have it both ways.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:07.740
You should go back.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.200
Go be a good reporter.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:11.330
At least you can be

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:12.320
of some value.

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:20.170
Go home first,

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.970
and get some things for Zhuling.

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:23.950
I'll stay here to take care of her.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.600
Are you still feeling unwell?

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:59.120
How did you know I was faking sleep?

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:01.460
Since you were little,
when you faked sleep,

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:02.940
you would always

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:04.120
sniffle.

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:05.450
Just like your mom.

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:09.580
Uncle,

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:13.200
my dad didn't mean to.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.000
I wasn't paying attention either

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:19.040
and didn't taste it.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:22.090
Although sometimes

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.580
he is quite annoying,

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:26.380
sometimes,

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:27.770
he's pretty different.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:30.580
Unlike you,

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:33.250
unlike Mom,

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:35.600
and unlike other dads,

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.770
he's different.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.180
Can you please not send him away?

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:51.180
If he leaves,

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:55.340
I won't have a dad anymore.

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:05.550
Where is Zhuling?

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:06.660
She's in the ward.

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.060
Bai Chun is with Zhuling.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:08.980
I'm sorry.

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:09.640
I really...

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:10.750
No, it's me. It was my negligence.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:11.150
Let go of me.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:12.750
I don't want to talk to you right now.

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:13.750
Really, I forgot.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.240
I didn't think about that.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.500
I'm sorry, okay?

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:17.650
I was wrong.

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:19.530
I really was wrong.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.260
Do you have to talk about this now?

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.300
Let's talk when you're free.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.700
When will you be free?

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:42.820
Or rather, your free time,

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:43.270
when can you

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:44.370
spare some for me?

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:47.530
These past few days, let alone seeing you,

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:48.220
I couldn't even

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.250
get through to your phone.

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:50.440
I told you I was busy.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.610
With the nature of our jobs,

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:53.910
can't you understand?

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:55.430
But if it were me,

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.060
I would still save

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.070
some time for you.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.980
When I was stationed in Mazhi,

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:03.450
I stayed for three years.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:05.530
What I cared about

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:07.510
wasn't the promotion after returning.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:09.230
It was because you were in Mazhi,

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:11.030
that I was willing to stay there.

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:15.530
You used to say,

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.760
if a place holds no one you care about,

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.480
you won't stay, no matter how nice it is.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.210
Shao Yunfei,

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:23.380
you're not the only one compromising,

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:24.640
or making sacrifices.

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:25.980
After Zhuling was born,

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:26.480
in order to give her

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.740
a better environment,

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:28.500
didn't we

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:29.510
move to Tianduo?

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:30.180
Yes.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:32.750
That was your biggest compromise.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:33.880
I understand.

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:51.440
I know.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.170
Captain's case

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:54.570
is very important to you.

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.150
But I thought I,

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:01.360
or rather this family,

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.420
would also have a place in your heart.

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:07.090
At least an equal place.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:09.450
Even after we separated,

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:11.520
that's what I still believed.

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:16.250
Now it seems

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:18.930
I was wrong.

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:22.970
If that's what you think,

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:25.750
there's nothing I can do.

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:34.970
I always thought

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:37.620
we were different from those

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.170
divorced couples.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.690
Have we been apart too long?

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.280
Do we not even have
that understanding anymore?

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:00.660
We divorced because

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:03.760
whenever I see you,

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:06.170
I think of

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.000
our days in the Mountain Patrol.

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:09.970
I keep telling myself,

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.140
"It's all in the past.

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:16.390
It's all in the past.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:18.119
Don't think about it anymore."

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:20.010
But it turns out,

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:22.869
life after that

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:24.900
became increasingly meaningless.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.000
I thought maybe

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:32.230
if I didn't see you,

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:33.750
I'd feel a bit better.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.490
But maybe not seeing you

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.360
would be even harder.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.390
That year or so in the Mountain Patrol

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:46.420
was the most important time

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:47.840
of my life.

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:51.670
So important that

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.280
if I were to carry it forever,

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:56.670
I feel

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.290
so suffocating.

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:03.590
That feeling,

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:09.020
maybe only you can understand.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.030
Have you eaten?

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:29.520
No.

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:33.010
Go down and buy two meals.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.010
I haven't eaten either.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:06.060
Wu Jiang.

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:07.290
Don't think

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:08.810
that just because you stay silent,

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:10.340
we can't do anything to you.

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:13.170
Your girlfriend, Shen Yuhong,

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:14.700
came to ask about you again.

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:15.740
Don't you want

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:16.940
to clear things up

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:18.370
and see her sooner?

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:29.660
Let's stop here.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:32.050
Okay.

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:39.740
Wu Jiang.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:41.980
If you confirm it's correct,

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:42.500
sign,

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:44.500
and press your fingerprint.

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:49.050
Captain. Captain.

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:50.740
He swallowed athepen!

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:51.180
Spit it out!

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:51.760
Wu Jiang!

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:52.590
Spit it out!

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:53.510
Get the pen out!

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:54.130
Pry his mouth...

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:54.790
Pry his mouth open.

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:55.610
Get it out.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.380
Spit it out!

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:57.900
Spit it out!

00:19:59.130 --> 00:19:59.980
Spit it out!

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:02.380
Is there any progress

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.910
on the regreening project?

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:05.290
Director Huang

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:06.040
has sent over

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:06.980
the experts' proposal.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:07.700
We are currently

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:08.520
working on the budget

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:09.850
based on that proposal.

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:11.610
It's not cheap, is it?

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:12.880
The startup capital

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.230
is at least 200 million.

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:15.420
As for the follow-up,

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.550
it depends on the provincial funding.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:19.770
Do they think my money

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:21.010
grows on trees?

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.130
But this is enough to scare off

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:24.340
those companies

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:24.940
that want to

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:26.140
compete with us.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:32.200
Hello.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.180
Okay.

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:37.680
I got it.

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:40.480
That was Lawyer Xu.

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:42.590
It went according to plan.

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:45.040
Wu Jiang is in the hospital now.

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:47.230
Send him away.

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:50.790
Go arrange it.

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:54.980
Bai.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:57.790
Dr. Liu.

00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.150
What are you doing here?

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:00.770
My child is hospitalized for an allergy.

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:01.830
She's on a drip now.

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:02.940
Is it serious?

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.860
It's fine. She's much better.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:05.730
That's good.

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:06.760
Just in time.

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:07.450
The X-rays

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:08.140
ma'am asked me to look for.

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:08.810
I found them.

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:10.270
Could you bring them back?

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:11.350
What X-ray?

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.220
Are these really Captain Duojie's?

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:17.180
Yes.

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:19.960
Look here.

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:22.500
Here.

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:24.000
It's a clear case

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.330
of bone spur formation.

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:26.160
That's why back then,

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.690
his lower back always hurt.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:28.970
Also,

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.730
his gastritis was very severe.

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.630
County Mayor Duojie

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:33.700
really didn't pay enough attention

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:34.700
to his own health.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:36.720
But back then,

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.440
our hospital didn't have a gastroscope.

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.200
Otherwise, with a gastroscopy,

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.640
early detection and treatment,

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.030
it might not have become

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:41.960
such a big issue.

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:00.640
Okay.

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:01.910
Understood.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:05.140
Captain.

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:06.350
Zhao and the team

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:07.280
are on their way.

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:08.190
Wait for the surgery to end,

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:09.250
and you can go back.

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:11.930
When the surgery is over,

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:13.530
don't leave him unattended.

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:15.440
He's doing this

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.570
because he's about to crack.

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:18.300
Understood.

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:24.530
Where is he?

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:25.270
Over there.

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:26.340
He ran that way.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:39.820
Hello.

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:41.240
Please show me your ID.

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:15.940
Take care.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.170
A peach tree living for 4 years
doesn’t mean it’s thriving.

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:25.000
A jujube tree can appear dead for 3 years
yet still be alive.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.060
You take care, too.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:23.640
Wu Jiang kept saying

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:24.680
someone was framing him.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:25.410
It looks like

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.140
this person not only wants Wu Jiang
to take the fall,

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:27.680
but more importantly,

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:28.200
they don't want us

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.440
to keep investigating.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.030
The driver involved in the crash

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:30.830
has been brought back.

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:31.450
He claims

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.540
the brakes failed.

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:34.480
Whether it was intentional or an accident

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.740
is hard to tell right now.

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:36.440
Investigate everything

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.040
about him.

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:38.830
Don't interrogate him just yet.

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:39.220
Okay.

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:46.150
Here.

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:47.200
Yes.

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:49.100
Is it this piece?

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:51.060
It's osteophyte.

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:54.650
Based on the timeline,

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:58.010
this osteophyte appeared

00:24:58.010 --> 00:24:58.830
shortly after Captain Duojie's

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:00.050
accident.

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.440
It couldn't just disappear.

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:05.010
Even with wear and degradation,

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:06.760
it wouldn't completely wear away

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:07.830
the original abrasion

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:09.890
and the parts that have been created.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.290
I think your theory

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:16.020
makes sense.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.030
These remains

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.050
might not belong to Duojie.

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:24.510
Chief.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:25.480
These

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:26.770
are all obvious facts.

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:28.230
How can we not consider it?

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:29.610
Who said we aren't considering it?

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:30.590
But how can we be certain

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:31.970
based on just a bone spur

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.800
less than two centimeters wide?

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:36.240
Then explain to me

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:37.850
the items found

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:38.810
next to the body.

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:39.720
What about the bullet

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:40.570
fired from Qimaer's gun?

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:41.850
How do you explain that?

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:42.560
All this evidence

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:43.830
points to Duojie.

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:46.110
Are you just ignoring all of that?

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:48.250
Even if all the evidence points to Duojie,

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:49.180
as long as

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:50.480
there is one piece of evidence

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.540
that disproves it,

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:52.940
we shouldn't verify it.

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:54.740
Wu Jiang died
under such strange circumstances.

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:55.870
We shouldn't simply assume

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:57.740
that Wu Jiang killed Duojie
out of revenge.

00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:58.770
There might be another mastermind

00:25:58.770 --> 00:25:59.550
behind this.

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:00.510
You're right.

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:07.350
Your most important task now

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:08.750
is to get to the bottom

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:10.230
of Wu Jiang's death for me.

00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:20.870
Here.

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:22.640
Take a look.

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:24.830
See which one looks good.

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:32.290
[Mazhi County Cultural Mausoleum]

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:34.090
Did you ask Cairen what he wants?

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.810
I did.

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:36.520
Cairen still wants

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.680
to choose a cemetery

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:39.690
in Mazhi County.

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:41.310
After all, Mazhi

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.750
is Duojie's hometown.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:43.960
True.

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.960
All I picked out are double plots.

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:47.980
Many old colleagues in Mazhi

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:48.900
donated money.

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:52.240
and chose this 15,000 yuan one.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:53.800
But Madam Zhu thinks

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:55.850
the 10,000 yuan one

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:57.070
is also fine.

00:26:58.720 --> 00:26:59.880
My father-in-law's funeral

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.210
was held here back then.

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.840
There's no substantial progress

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:11.000
on the skeleton case right now.

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:13.430
The identity verification of the skeleton

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:14.760
keeps getting delayed.

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:15.990
Shi.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.160
Logically speaking,

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.240
you are right.

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:23.300
As an outsider,

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:24.800
I shouldn't say too much.

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:27.420
But emotionally speaking,

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:30.300
we all know the truth.

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:32.060
Besides,

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.370
there's so much supporting evidence.

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:41.540
My only regret

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:43.980
is that the killer

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:45.540
while on the run,

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:47.640
died in an accident.

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.610
He didn't face justice.

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.940
Seventeen years have passed.

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:57.180
This matter

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:58.640
finally has a conclusion.

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.690
Our old leader in Mazhi,

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:02.770
Secretary Chen,

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.520
calls me

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:05.700
every now and then.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.590
He says once the case is closed,

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:08.950
he'll apply to have Duojie

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:10.560
recognized as a martyr.

00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:19.580
Understood.

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:25.430
I have to chip in, too.

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:28.140
Let's get this 15,000 one.

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:29.880
I'll keep a close eye

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:30.880
on the task force.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.030
I'll make them get results
as soon as possible.

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:33.530
Okay.

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:36.720
Near the hospital, Wu Jiang

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.740
stole a car.

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:39.110
Surveillance shows that

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:40.610
ten minutes before the accident,

00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:41.440
his car stopped here

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.330
for 3 minutes.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.690
Then he walked into Jiege Lane.

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:45.480
When he came out,

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.040
he was holding

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.070
a black travel bag,

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:48.200
and then drove away.

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:50.500
Can we get fingerprints?

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.030
No complete fingerprints.

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:53.290
The fabric of the travel bag

00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:54.110
is too rough.

00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:57.970
Who gave him this bag?

00:28:58.660 --> 00:28:59.070
Does this lane

00:28:59.070 --> 00:28:59.980
have any other exits?

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:01.310
There is one other exit.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:03.200
But the surveillance cameras there
were broken,

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.260
and are under maintenance,

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:06.120
so they didn't capture anything.

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:10.040
Captain Bai.

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:11.420
Could it be that Wu Jiang

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.780
planned to run away long ago

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:14.640
and hid the money here in advance?

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:16.980
Unlikely.

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:19.220
Wu Jiang doesn't seem like

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:20.680
someone that meticulous.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.550
If he were that calculating,

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:23.140
he wouldn't act so flashy

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:24.180
usually.

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:26.050
Besides,

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:27.480
he couldn't confirm

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:28.200
when he would

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.130
be interrogated

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:30.010
or when

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:31.830
he would have a chance to escape.

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.770
So,

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:34.200
this must have been

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.580
a spur-of-the-moment action that night.

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:36.990
You mean

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.960
someone gave it to him in person?

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:40.880
Who could it be?

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:44.680
Our next step is to investigate

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.140
Wu Jiang's social circle.

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:47.920
Check what they were doing

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:49.380
at the time of the crime.

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:50.790
This person

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:51.810
could contact Wu Jiang on short notice

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:52.880
and possesses some

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:54.070
counter-reconnaissance

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:55.110
awareness.

00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:57.380
Let's investigate in this direction first.

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:58.090
Okay, got it.

00:29:58.090 --> 00:29:59.510
Bai, it's meeting time.

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:00.550
I need to interrogate
the hit-and-run driver later.

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:01.880
Tell him to postpone it.

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:04.180
It's not Captain Xie calling the meeting.

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:04.750
It's the Chief

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:06.410
calling a task force meeting.

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:07.550
What for?

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:07.690
The current

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:08.160
[Missing Person]

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.730
forensic report shows that

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.220
the body's age,

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.290
height, and other physical features

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:14.350
match County Mayor Duojie's

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:15.350
almost perfectly.

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:16.700
What about the clothes
found near the body?

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:17.830
Mostly rotted away.

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.480
Only a few buttons remain,

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:20.500
which are a basic match

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:21.530
to the button of clothes

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:23.170
County Mayor Duojie wore when alive.

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:24.680
Then it's highly probable

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:25.660
that the remains

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:27.390
belong to County Mayor Duojie.

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.700
Xia Jie, based on

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:29.900
the new X-ray I found,

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:31.330
has raised an objection.

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:32.530
The lack of bone spur on the bones

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:34.130
is a major suspicious point.

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:35.480
Xia Jie only proved that

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.610
the bone spur doesn't match Duojie's

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:37.610
medical records.

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:38.710
But these remains

00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:39.830
were already highly

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:40.770
skeletonized.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.070
In burial cases like this,

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:43.920
hyperplastic tissue

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.270
is easily eroded.

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.330
But we can't ignore

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:48.130
the newly discovered evidence.

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:48.950
Bai Ju.

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.610
You are using 1% of

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:51.210
uncertainty

00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:52.670
to question 99% of

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:54.480
the complete chain of evidence.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.070
Chief,

00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:56.550
isn't investigating that 1%

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:57.350
exactly what

00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:58.530
we do?

00:30:58.820 --> 00:30:59.950
With that 1% of

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:00.460
uncertainty,

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:01.140
who can guarantee

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:01.980
that the conclusion drawn

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.650
is 100% the truth?

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.160
From Wu Jiang's car,

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.400
a gun was suddenly found.

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.350
The origin of this gun

00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:14.310
is inconclusive.

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:15.140
It's suspicious.

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:16.250
He self-harmed to undergo surgery

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:17.750
and still knew the escape route.

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:18.480
It's suspicious.

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.180
After he escaped,

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:20.210
from whom did he

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:21.400
get a large sum of cash,

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.070
before suddenly being killed by a car?

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:24.070
It's suspicious.

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:25.460
These doubts make me suspect

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:26.610
that someone is plotting

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:27.350
to cover up

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:29.340
the truth about Duojie's disappearance.

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:30.470
This further proves

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:31.890
we should be cautious in determining

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:33.490
the identity of the remains.

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:38.650
No one is being careless.

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:41.090
The Ministry of Public Security

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:42.070
Identification Center instructor

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:43.000
told us during training

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:43.550
that

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:44.960
apart from DNA,

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:46.420
all identification techniques

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:47.400
can only disprove,

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:48.400
they cannot serve as

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.980
the sole basis for confirmation.

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:50.610
But since Duojie

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:51.920
has no immediate family DNA

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.120
to provide evidence,

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.340
biologically speaking,

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:55.630
100% certainty

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:57.250
can never be obtained.

00:31:57.730 --> 00:31:58.590
So what do we do?

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:01.330
Ignoring 99%

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:02.910
of the evidence is gone at the scene?

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:03.370
Right?

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:05.030
Just keep dragging this out?

00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:06.660
Drag it out until we retire?

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:08.630
How do we answer to

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:09.450
the family?

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:10.920
How do we answer to the people

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.220
of Tianduo and Mazhi?

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:13.610
Bai Ju.

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:15.920
Duojie wasn't just your Captain.

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.450
He was my leader too.

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:22.770
Think about it.

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:30.140
Meeting adjourned.

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:39.590
Let's go. Interrogate the driver.

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:49.120
I'm giving you a chance to come clean now.

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:50.880
Who put you up to this?

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.000
I've said it many times.

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:55.460
It was brake failure.

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:56.220
Lies.

00:32:58.050 --> 00:32:58.640
The traffic police

00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:59.900
accident report shows

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:00.850
the brake system

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:01.950
was sabotaged.

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:04.810
Wednesday at 4 PM,

00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:06.220
the repair shop surveillance caught

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:07.500
you working under the car.

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:08.500
The footage is very clear.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:09.090
Do you need me to

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:10.090
pull it up for you?

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.040
You were deliberately sabotaging
the brakes.

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:13.780
Weren't you?

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.830
That was routine maintenance.

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:16.560
You can check

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:17.440
the work orders.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:18.300
Why would I

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:19.270
sabotage my own brakes?

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:20.200
To kill Wu Jiang.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.070
To stage a car accident

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:22.160
and silence him.

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:23.860
Let me tell you,

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:26.170
your boss has already confessed.

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:27.780
He ordered you to do it.

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:29.070
Now I'm giving you a chance

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:30.330
to speak for yourself.

00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:32.270
I... What?

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:33.400
What silencing?

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:34.980
I don't understand.

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:41.930
Think carefully.

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:43.500
If you confess honestly,

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:44.920
you're just an accomplice.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.250
You won't be in for long.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.530
But if you refuse to cooperate,

00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:49.520
we will

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:50.890
inform the court

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:52.440
and ask for a heavy sentence.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:53.460
You might never see

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:54.460
your child again.

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:55.010
No...

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:56.660
Officer,

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.900
what do you want me to confess?

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.390
I just didn't brake in time.

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:02.260
I am guilty.

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:04.690
It's not too late
to change your statement.

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:05.530
Tell me.

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:08.280
Is there a criminal gang

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.280
threatening you?

00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:12.000
Threatening your family?

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:14.030
Criminal gang?

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:15.219
Tell me!

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:16.150
Bai Ju!

00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:17.340
Stop.

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:17.880
Speak!

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:19.030
Who is it?

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:19.679
Come out!

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:22.440
He was about to confess.

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:28.929
[Chief's Office]

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:30.110
Surveillance shows

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:31.190
that Wu Jiang's trunk

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:32.520
might have been opened.

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:33.530
But this person,

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:34.880
he avoided the cameras.

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:36.050
While Wu Jiang was running,

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:36.630
he received

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:37.780
a large sum of cash.

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:38.460
The person who handed it over

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:39.610
also avoided surveillance.

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:41.690
They have
strong counter-reconnaissance skills.

00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:42.360
I suspect

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.340
the person who planted the gun
on Wu Jiang,

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:45.310
then gave him money,

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:46.400
and ordered the truck driver

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:46.940
to kill him,

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:48.400
is likely the same person.

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:49.670
The most direct lead we have now

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:50.940
is right in front of us.

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:51.630
It's that

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:52.900
truck driver.

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:54.280
So I want to find a breakthrough

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:55.010
as soon as possible

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:56.870
to dig out the person behind this.

00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:58.130
You asked me to investigate

00:34:58.130 --> 00:34:58.920
Wu Jiang's death.

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:00.260
That's what I'm doing.

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:02.430
I'm sure you've realized too.

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:03.750
There's one

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:04.690
obvious truth.

00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:05.900
That person didn't want

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:06.880
Wu Jiang to talk.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:07.920
He wanted Wu Jiang

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.580
to take the truth to his grave.

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:12.110
Okay.

00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:15.070
High suspicion,

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:16.960
bold assumptions.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.930
But you don't have a shred of evidence.

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:24.090
Do you think the Procuratorate will accept

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:25.890
confessions obtained this way?

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:26.500
Do I need to remind you
of the regulations set

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:27.340
by the Supreme People's Procuratorate

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:29.400
and the Ministry of Public Security?

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:30.820
Threats,

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.210
inducement, coaching, and deception.

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:34.450
You almost ticked all the boxes

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:35.910
in less than five minutes.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:36.800
Bai Ju,

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:38.980
what exactly are you trying to do?

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:43.390
Five minutes.

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:47.980
But do you know,

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:53.600
for these short five minutes,

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:56.110
I've waited 17 years.

00:35:58.370 --> 00:35:59.570
Seventeen years ago,

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:02.090
those people used the same kind
of car accident

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:02.900
to target me.

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:05.450
I survived by sheer luck.

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:08.150
But little Zhang Yang...

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:11.710
Back then,

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:14.260
as a young police officer,

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:15.590
I wasn't mature enough.

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:17.250
Our criminal investigation methods

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:18.100
were also very limited.

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:19.960
There were no surveillance cameras.

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:20.690
So in the end,

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.440
it could only be classified and handled

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:24.300
as an ordinary traffic accident.

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:26.990
After Li Yongqiang was shot dead

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:28.280
at the Qima'er Gold Mine,

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:29.320
the truth of that incident

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.760
was buried forever.

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:32.820
Zhang Yang's death,

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:36.890
the real culprit
behind the gold mine case,

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:40.320
and Captain Duojie's disappearance.

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:46.990
Chief,

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:51.730
all these years,

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:54.060
I haven't had a single good night's sleep.

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:55.400
I'm afraid that

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:56.460
I'll dream of them.

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:01.020
I can't face them.

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:05.910
Zhang Yang,

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:07.930
He Qingyuan,

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.450
and Captain Duojie.

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:12.770
The truth of the past

00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:13.730
and the present

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:15.880
shouldn't be hastily buried

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:17.670
without clarity.

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:24.110
Chief,

00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:26.640
as a police officer,

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:27.710
I admit

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:28.990
I lost my cool just now.

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:31.830
But please understand me.

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:35.510
Please give me a little more time.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.300
I just need a little time.

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:52.780
Bai Ju,

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.200
we've worked together for so many years.

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:00.040
You have always been

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:01.050
a trustworthy

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:02.840
comrade.

00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:05.760
For many issues,

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.000
you reflect on them yourself

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:11.070
without needing correction from others.

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:12.100
So now,

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:13.380
just as you said,

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:16.680
you are no longer calm.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.500
I'll tell Xie Yang

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:23.700
to let you go back and rest for a while.

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:29.430
Chief,

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:34.170
do you mean

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:38.390
for me to leave the task force?

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:41.500
As a police officer,

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:43.300
you must never let emotions control you

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.990
at any time.

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:47.830
I think if Duojie were here,

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:51.210
he would say the same.

I haven't seen

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:07.760
this kind of wine in a long time.

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:09.970
Does it still taste the same?

00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:10.550
Try it.

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.460
Still tastes awful.

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:30.440
Here.

00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:42.190
It's delicious.

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.260
It's still sizzling.

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:47.540
Smells great.

00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:57.540
You guys eat, too.

00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:00.240
Does watching me make you full?

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:03.090
Bai.

00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:07.250
I heard things aren't going well at work.

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:09.260
We know you have rules.

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:12.420
We're not asking you to say anything.

00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:17.920
If you're unhappy, just come eat meat.

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:18.780
We have plenty.

00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:24.020
Then I'll come every day.

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:26.850
I'm on leave now.

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:28.410
I have plenty of time.

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:33.610
About Captain's case,

00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:35.270
it hasn't been cleared up yet.

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:36.670
I...

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:43.730
In the future, I might not even

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:45.660
be able to wear the police uniform.

00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:01.320
If I really take off my police uniform,

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:03.420
you think I'd want your security uniform?

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:04.130
Put this on.

00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:05.790
It's cold.

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:12.610
Shao.

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:13.640
Stop there.

00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:22.910
You invited him?

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:25.740
He came to me to drown his sorrows.

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.490
He cried even more than Han.

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:30.880
Said you don't love him anymore.

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:32.510
You reminded me.

00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:33.790
I remember now.

00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:35.330
Go get your...

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:37.190
that highland barley wine.

00:42:37.450 --> 00:42:38.450
-Hurry up.
-Okay.

00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:41.850
The meat is ready.

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:51.490
Smells so good.

00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:03.490
Why are you looking at me?

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:06.880
You look really good in that outfit.
