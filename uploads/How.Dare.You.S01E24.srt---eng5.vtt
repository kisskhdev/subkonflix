00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.979
[How dare you!?]

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.940
[Episode 24]

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.780
Let go of me!

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.280
Dan!

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.479
-Your Majesty!
-Dan!

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:48.400
Mr. Bei,

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.520
you go.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.720
Only you can save her.

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.150
Please go, okay?

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.850
If I go,

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.220
who will protect you?

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.000
But Mr. Bei...

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.660
I cannot go!

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.970
Your Majesty...

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.940
I'm begging you.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.600
I can't let anything happen to her.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.000
Serving an emperor
is like walking with a tiger.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.240
Does he like me,

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.280
or my foresight
that works only half the time?

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.430
I think you know the answer.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.310
When the powerful clash,

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.780
people like us suffer.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.840
At this point,

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.270
I no longer dream of a good match.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.850
I just want to leave this dangerous place

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.670
and live out the rest of my life in peace.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.960
Wanyin.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.540
If you were so afraid,

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.480
why didn't you come to me?

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.000
Don't you have Consort Xie now?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.460
She is just my strategist.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.000
How shameless.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.870
You look like

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.710
you're thinking of
how to continue deceiving me.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.360
Fine.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.360
Since you want to hear the truth,

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.829
I'll tell you.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.310
I once, like Consort Xie,

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.520
foresaw your future—

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.140
turning the tide when all seemed lost

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.150
and receiving the people's homage.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.710
It's just that...

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:41.310
What?

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.710
It's just that

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.800
the one standing beside you
to receive that homage

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.280
was not me.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:00.510
Great answer.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.220
It's the truth.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.840
In this life,

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.560
I will stand beside no woman.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.520
If there must be one,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.250
it could only be you.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:14.770
Why do you say that?

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.600
Because I've been waiting for you
for a long time.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.480
More precisely,

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.520
it started 10 years ago, at 2 a.m.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.360
on that night.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.610
You both claimed you had foresight

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.430
and knew I was the chosen one.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.510
Were those merely pleasing lies?

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.570
Then why did I believe them?

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.560
Why?

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.450
Because that was what I thought!

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.710
You only spoke
what was already in my heart.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.640
Being the chosen one

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.310
is simply where the people's support
comes together.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.630
Whoever they want to be emperor

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:10.750
becomes emperor.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.190
So it's not that something happens

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.970
and then they believe.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.410
Rather, because you believe,

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:19.870
it happens.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Seven.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.800
When I was 7,
that lowly slave could pull my ear

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.130
and say I was born lowly.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:33.680
Was I born lowly?

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.870
No.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.830
It was the Empress Dowager and that tyrant

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.960
who made them believe I was born lowly.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.270
So when I grew up,

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.360
I learned how to change my fate.

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.800
That means

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:55.159
having the very best of everything:

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:59.600
fame,

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.720
achievements,

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.190
and women.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.870
Only then

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.360
would the whole world

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.470
direct their will toward me.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.160
Speaking of Xiahou Bo,

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.880
people naturally say

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.440
that Prince Duan
is not only far from lowly,

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.920
but extremely noble—

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.070
so noble that none can reach him,

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.490
so noble that he is the chosen one,

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:40.820
the one the people believe
will become emperor.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:44.120
Wanyin,

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.290
do you want to be the most honored woman
in the world,

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.460
or just a footnote in history,

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.280
a little-known demonic consort

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.430
who dies young?

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:04.920
Your Highness Prince Duan!

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.480
Your Highness Prince Duan!

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.310
I am here to pick up the Noble Consort!

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.430
Thank you, Your Highness Prince Duan,

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.220
for saving Her Highness.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.240
I have been sent by His Majesty's decree

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:34.180
to take Her Highness

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.560
back to the palace!

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.620
The Emperor sent people to claim you.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.810
Tell me, should I hand you over or not?

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.640
I was suddenly attacked.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.120
It's understandable

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:49.720
that he sent people.

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.430
Rest assured, Your Highness.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:54.790
I won't tell anyone

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.130
what we said today
after I leave the carriage.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.780
Then does that mean

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.720
you are not going to consider me?

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.610
Since you call it "considering,"

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:08.680
why not give me more time?

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.240
With the Imperial Guards outside,

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.970
now is truly not the right moment
to discuss this.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.040
If you don't mind,

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:17.560
we can continue communicating

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.310
by secret letters
after I return to the palace.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:20.310
What do you think?

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.120
Of course I don't mind.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:33.480
Well then...

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:36.200
take care.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:46.830
10 years ago,

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:48.240
[In Memory of Li, Mother of Prince]

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:48.550
[Ten years ago]

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:49.480
at 2 a.m.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:57.390
So this is the Second Prince?

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.930
Why isn't there a nanny looking after him?

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.440
His birth mother was a palace maid.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:04.870
She thought giving birth to a prince
would make her noble,

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.070
but the Empress had her beaten to death.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.870
Everyone in the palace tries to avoid him.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:11.670
Who would want to be associated
with such bad luck?

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.760
He really was born lowly.

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:15.400
Let's go.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.610
Master,

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:23.080
I was the one dozing off.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.200
You punished the wrong person.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.200
The Crown Prince has a noble status.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.840
Even if he makes mistakes,

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.900
the punishment should be taken by
his study companion.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:51.840
I...

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:52.940
I...

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.850
work—serve...

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
in a nearby side hall.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:59.590
You can't even learn these few lines?

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.290
I can learn them.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.320
Remember,

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.300
you're very scared.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.770
Speak haltingly.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.150
I work in a nearby side hall.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.170
I often saw

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.760
a wandering figure there

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.040
and grew curious.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.450
So I dug a little when no one was around.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.550
We're the same kind.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:19.210
How are you?

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:21.910
What's the second half of "study hard"?

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:22.670
I don't understand.

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:23.840
What holiday is June 1st?

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.770
Your Highness, you're hurting me.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.050
You're all I have in this world.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.310
I'll go get someone!

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:31.000
Stop!

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:31.870
No.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:33.670
No, no one can know.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:34.840
No one can know.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.600
I killed someone?

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:41.170
I didn't mean to.

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:42.850
I didn't mean to!

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:58.790
Your Highness...

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:02.770
I've done as you said.

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:13.960
The same kind?

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.170
Xiahou Dan.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.660
What kind of
"same kind" are you looking for?

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:26.890
Your Highness.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:29.750
The person you just shot has been saved.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:31.720
What did he find?

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.960
Consort Yu had a mechanism
hidden in her sleeve,

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.360
which we've seen before.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:37.930
Judging by its design,

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.490
it seems capable
of shooting hidden arrows.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:43.940
Your Highness.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.680
Go deliver the message to the generals.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:48.150
Yes.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.910
Since this is your choice,

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:55.390
I shall grant it.

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:19.680
[Wucheng Gate]

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:49.480
I was wrong.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.870
I shouldn't have left the palace
without permission.

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:05.450
You deserve to die.

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:07.600
I failed to take proper care

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:27.110
Your Majesty,

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.410
your wound had already healed.

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:31.610
How can it tear open like this now?

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.820
There was an assassin yesterday.

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:46.740
Alright, Your Majesty.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:51.730
Don't stare.

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.070
Your Majesty,
you need to restrain yourself.

00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:59.400
I'll go prepare your medicine right away.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.160
The medicine box.

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:08.840
What an assassin.

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:10.960
She left me covered in wounds

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.700
and even scared Physician Xiao away.

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:15.480
Then blame yourself

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.460
for being that devastatingly handsome.

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:20.790
Which woman at my age

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.730
could resist such temptation?

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:24.790
Wanyin,

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:26.950
be gentler next time.

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:29.970
We'll see then.

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:31.830
You'll be late for the morning court.

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:32.720
Let's go now.

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:35.150
It's just being late
for the morning court.

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:38.130
There's still a long way to go before I

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:40.440
abandon the morning court entirely
for you.

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.720
So you're saying

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.100
I should keep up the good work?

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.840
It seems my dear
still has plenty of energy.

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:50.240
The one who should keep up the good work

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.350
is me.

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:57.250
We'd better
follow the doctor's instructions.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:05.610
What's this?

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:07.570
Xiahou Bo did it.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.530
In the carriage yesterday.

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:20.880
After hiding for so long,

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:25.380
we still couldn't keep you
out of his notice.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.460
There's nothing we can do.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.180
From the moment he knew

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.030
I had the foresight,

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:35.010
there were only 2 possible outcomes
for me with him:

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.500
either to be used by him

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.110
or to die.

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:46.730
Neither of these two outcomes

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:48.240
will happen.

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:52.670
Whether in life or death,

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:54.920
I will never leave you.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.040
I trust you.

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:13.440
Since he'll suspect us no matter what,

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:16.070
we might as well go all in.

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:18.440
How?

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:23.440
A straight.

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:25.220
Look at this hand.

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:26.440
What great luck.

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:28.880
A straight, huh?

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:30.550
Wait.

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:31.580
Don't rush.

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:34.050
Let me see.

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.200
Break up this pair.

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:38.760
Put this here.

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.140
There, that's a straight.

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:42.490
I'll cover.

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:45.530
Right, right.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:46.570
It covered that.

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:50.720
You.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.050
You're quite good at it.

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:55.640
Lord Yu.

00:29:58.030 --> 00:29:58.830

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:00.130
You... How come you...

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:04.550
Wait, wait. I...

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:06.030
I was just playing for fun.

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:07.560
I wasn't gambling, really.

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.070
They're all my servants.

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:10.150
-You can ask them.
-Yes.

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:11.030
No money involved.

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:11.750
Lord Yu,

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.320
you're overthinking it.

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:15.930
As the father of the Empress,

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:18.050
what's wrong with doing a little gambling?

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:20.110
And what's wrong with playing cards?

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.840
The Empress?

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:29.240
Just now in court,

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:33.690
His Majesty officially declared
Noble Consort Yu as Empress.

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.700
Imperial Father-in-law,

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:37.270
congratulations.

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:42.270
Master!

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:42.750
Lord Yu?

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.070
Three, two, three, four.

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:48.750
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:49.760
Xie Yong'er.

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:50.890
Don't slack off.

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:53.640
Four, two, three, four.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.510
-Five, six, seven, eight.
-I didn't expect that

00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:57.550
-nearly 10 years after
-Five, two, three, four.

00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:59.000
graduating middle school,

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.200
I'd be doing broadcast exercises here.

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:04.110
Exercise is important.

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:05.310
Yeah, yeah.

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:06.550
Come on, next set—

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:07.740
jumping jacks.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:08.680
Ready, go!

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.330
-One, two...
-Stop.

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:14.750
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.970
What are you...

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:17.680
doing?

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:19.290
Broadcast exercises.

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:20.310
Your Majesty,

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:21.270
would you like to join us?

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:21.890
Yes, yes.

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:24.270
Her Majesty has been teaching us
lots of exercises lately.

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:25.310
They're all actually fun.

00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:26.550
My sleep

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:27.920
has actually improved a lot.

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.920
Her Majesty even taught us a slogan:

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:31.880
"Get moving, focus on yourself,

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.680
purify the environment, start with me."

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:36.640
What do you think?

00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:43.820
So all this time
you've been standing me up

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.550
just to do this?

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:46.590
Or what else?

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.440
I'm the Empress now,

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:50.830
their boss.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.810
You care about the empire in court,

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:55.030
so I certainly need to care about

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:57.560
the quality of life
for the women in the harem.

00:31:58.550 --> 00:31:59.810
I live in the harem too.

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:01.990
But my quality of life

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.520
has been declining sharply.

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:05.960
Don't be so dramatic.

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:09.690
Alright.

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:10.920
Next,

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:12.830
let's move on to the next exercise.

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:14.550
Okay!

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.810
We need you for this one.

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:35.310
Run!

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:50.180
Run faster!

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:01.780
Hurry!

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:05.550
The water's boiling.

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:06.770
We can start now.

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:07.820
I'm not eating.

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:09.350
So arrogant?

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.240
Mr. Bei made sour soup hotpot.

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:12.880
Are you really not eating?

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:13.680
Are you sure?

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:16.610
How did I, a ruler of the nation,

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:20.710
end up playing
"Eagle Catches Chicks" with you in public?

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.200
Hotpot?

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:26.310
Just cook me instead.

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:31.990
A good emperor
enjoys time with his people.

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:34.480
Besides, weren't you having fun just now?

00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:40.280
Physician Xiao said
you need moderate exercise.

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:42.210
I was doing this for your own good.

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:44.930
Everything is for my own good.

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:47.920
You're closer

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:49.400
to those consorts

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.270
than to me now.

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:54.750
I should've just kept you
in the Cold Palace

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:56.350
Playing with them every day?

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:58.980
You're jealous?

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.790
Who's jealous?

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.680
Of those consorts?

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:04.880
Dan,

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.750
Eunuch An sent word

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:08.760
that the Empress Dowager is dying.

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:10.710
Didn't Physician Xiao say

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:12.570
she could hold on a little longer?

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.590
How could my mother

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.719
let everything go my way?

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.060
I'll see her off one last time.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:24.730
I'll go with you.

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:26.920
His Majesty has arrived!

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:27.710
Mother!

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:31.670
Physician Zhang!

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:33.670
Why did Mother pass away so suddenly?

00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:34.469
Your Majesty,

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.960
Her Majesty hasn't passed away yet.

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:40.810
Mother,

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:43.739
I've come to see you one last time.

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:44.540
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:46.270
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.650
Leave us, all of you.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:53.860
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:54.600
How is she?

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:56.280
I've administered acupuncture.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.150
At most, it will hold for 7 to 8 minutes.

00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:59.010
That's enough.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:07.560
Mother, don't worry.

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:10.510
Though we've fought for so long,

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:14.550
I won't hold grudges
against a dead person.

00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:18.150
You will still be buried
as Empress Dowager.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.680
In the history books,

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:21.920
you'll have your place.

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:30.400
Since you can't bear
to leave your beloved little prince,

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.200
I

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:32.870
will make him a prince

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:38.350
and have him live permanently at
the imperial mausoleum with you. Alright?

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:46.350
You needn't worry about my throne
lacking an heir.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.290
I have already crowned an empress.

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.240
In the future,

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:55.030
there will naturally
be a new crown prince.

00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.030
Forget it.

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.190
Is there any way

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:09.090
to make her speak clearly?

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:31.230
Xiahou Dan...

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.880
you're ruthless enough.

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:39.670
You really are the child I raised.

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:41.690
I'm ashamed.

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:45.350
I only learned a little from you.

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.000
You won't

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.710
have a good ending.

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:56.960
Fine. I'll be waiting.

00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:00.710
If you're still alive

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:03.480
and want revenge,

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:05.960
come find me anytime.

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:09.480
I don't hate you.

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.190
I don't hate anyone.

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:17.280
I just had bad luck

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:20.400
and chose the wrong poison.

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:33.880
Do you know

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:36.290
why you have been suffering

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:41.590
from headaches all these years?

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:44.660
Why?

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.280
Come here,

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:51.320
and I'll tell you.

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:54.200
Explain yourself clearly.

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:55.630
Come here.

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:04.390
Why?

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:05.950
Let go of my grandmother!

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:08.700
-There's poison!
-Your Majesty!

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:23.750
Go!

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:25.510
Go.

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.150
Your Majesty!

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.950
Your Majesty!

00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:34.510
The antidote.

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:36.960
The antidote!

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:38.920
Your Majesty!

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:39.720
Your Majesty!

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:42.680
Give me the antidote!

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.580
Where is the antidote?

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:45.600
Give it to me now!

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:50.400
Don't you want your little Crown Prince
to live?

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.480
-Give me the antidote!
-If anything happens to her,

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.400
you'll all die!

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:55.300
-Your Majesty.
-No, Your Majesty!
