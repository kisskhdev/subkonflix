{\an8}‪ADAPTED FROM A SHUQI.COM NOVEL
‪ORIGINAL AUTHOR: SENLIN LU

00:01:36.705 --> 00:01:38.425
Your Ladyship. Your Ladyship!

00:02:08.744 --> 00:02:10.705
Did you get the medicine into her?

00:02:10.785 --> 00:02:12.705
Yes. I forced plenty of water down too.

00:02:13.425 --> 00:02:14.545
She threw up blood and water.

00:02:14.625 --> 00:02:15.625
Two basins full.

00:02:17.065 --> 00:02:17.945
That can't be right.

00:02:18.025 --> 00:02:22.825
If she threw up, she should
be bouncing around now.

00:02:25.225 --> 00:02:29.025
Could I have gotten the dose wrong?

00:02:29.625 --> 00:02:30.825
Don't joke about that.

00:02:32.225 --> 00:02:33.545
Inspector Du.

00:02:33.625 --> 00:02:35.385
You have to help Her Ladyship.

00:02:35.465 --> 00:02:36.985
I was joking.

00:02:37.985 --> 00:02:40.665
If she's staying put, she'll be fine soon.

00:02:41.425 --> 00:02:43.145
She's just in there putting on a show.

00:02:43.225 --> 00:02:45.385
That's good. Let her rest up.

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:47.345
Once His Majesty leaves,

00:02:47.425 --> 00:02:50.545
I'll come back and give her
a proper beating to teach her a lesson.

00:02:54.185 --> 00:02:56.305
I've already lost a daughter.

00:02:57.385 --> 00:02:59.865
If something happens to you too,

00:03:00.385 --> 00:03:04.065
I don't know how I'm supposed to cope.

00:03:05.945 --> 00:03:07.145
Apologies for worrying Your Majesty.

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:11.985
You nearly died for this case.

00:03:12.865 --> 00:03:14.105
I can't believe they…

00:03:14.825 --> 00:03:16.225
Your Majesty, please don't be angry.

00:03:17.065 --> 00:03:19.385
Don't let me harm your bond
with your ministers.

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:21.265
They lost their daughters so suddenly.

00:03:21.345 --> 00:03:22.745
They panicked.

00:03:22.825 --> 00:03:23.945
Please don't blame them.

00:03:28.585 --> 00:03:30.065
You're such an understanding girl.

00:03:30.745 --> 00:03:31.825
Rest up.

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:34.745
Let someone else take this case.

00:03:36.265 --> 00:03:37.305
No.

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:41.145
Only I can take this case.

00:03:41.225 --> 00:03:42.665
I already have some leads.

00:03:42.745 --> 00:03:44.825
It won't take long to uncover the truth.

00:03:44.905 --> 00:03:46.945
If it's handed to someone else,
I won't be at ease.

00:03:47.905 --> 00:03:50.345
The moment you hear "case,"
you become like this.

00:03:51.225 --> 00:03:52.185
Remember,

00:03:52.785 --> 00:03:54.545
don't let yourself get hurt,

00:03:55.065 --> 00:03:56.465
and no more deaths.

00:03:56.545 --> 00:04:00.385
This has already caused
too much of a stir.

00:04:05.425 --> 00:04:08.545
Your Majesty, please don't tell
Consort Shu about this.

00:04:08.625 --> 00:04:11.705
Ninth Lady Cui's death
has already hit Her Highness hard.

00:04:12.305 --> 00:04:13.745
Don't let her worry about me too.

00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:20.425
Once I bring the killer to justice,
I'll go visit her.

00:04:38.305 --> 00:04:41.625
Princess Ningyuan's body was barely cold

00:04:41.705 --> 00:04:45.705
when Consort Shu's niece, Cui Manshu,
was found murdered.

00:04:46.385 --> 00:04:48.785
The Princess of Fuchang County
threw herself into this case,

00:04:49.305 --> 00:04:51.825
yet you hounded her without mercy.

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:55.105
His Majesty treats her like his own.

00:04:55.745 --> 00:04:59.465
What you did was outrageous,
and you've infuriated His Majesty!

00:05:00.985 --> 00:05:02.785
We were foolish.

00:05:02.865 --> 00:05:04.145
We overstepped.

00:05:04.225 --> 00:05:06.145
We beg His Majesty to punish us.

00:05:06.225 --> 00:05:08.825
We beg His Majesty to punish us!

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:12.465
His Majesty is merciful.

00:05:12.985 --> 00:05:15.665
Given your sudden loss of children

00:05:15.745 --> 00:05:18.465
and the grief it brings,

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:22.545
His Majesty orders you home
to hold your funerals.

00:05:23.345 --> 00:05:24.945
As for punishment,

00:05:26.105 --> 00:05:30.745
it will be decided
after the mourning period.

00:05:30.825 --> 00:05:33.185
We thank His Majesty.

00:05:33.265 --> 00:05:36.545
PALACE INVESTIGATION BUREAU

00:05:48.985 --> 00:05:51.225
Your Ladyship, I'm begging you.

00:05:51.305 --> 00:05:54.185
Don't ever do something like this again
without warning us.

00:05:54.745 --> 00:05:56.225
This time,
we have Deputy Director Xiao to thank.

00:05:56.305 --> 00:05:57.905
Without him,
I'd be pouring wine at your grave.

00:05:58.505 --> 00:06:00.505
Relax. I'm hard to kill.

00:06:01.105 --> 00:06:03.985
Every day, I feel like
my head's wobbling on my neck,

00:06:04.065 --> 00:06:05.345
ready to drop at any moment.

00:06:07.545 --> 00:06:09.745
Then have Mr. Xiao read your fortune.

00:06:09.825 --> 00:06:11.945
See when you'll die
and set your mind at ease.

00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:14.905
He was even more worried
about you dying than I was.

00:06:15.505 --> 00:06:17.025
He isn't in the mood for fortune-telling.

00:06:27.705 --> 00:06:30.065
If I were dead, you'd be back
at the Astronomical Bureau.

00:06:30.145 --> 00:06:30.985
Why were you worried?

00:06:31.065 --> 00:06:33.505
I was afraid I couldn't
live up to your trust and save you.

00:06:34.905 --> 00:06:35.905
I knew you could do it.

00:06:35.985 --> 00:06:37.065
I had no faith in myself.

00:06:39.585 --> 00:06:43.105
Mr. Xiao, you didn't come here
just to see if I'm dead, did you?

00:06:44.785 --> 00:06:45.905
It's about the killer in this case.

00:06:48.105 --> 00:06:48.945
You noticed it too?

00:06:54.465 --> 00:06:55.905
According to Zhou Helan,

00:06:55.985 --> 00:06:57.665
Cui Manshu set a trap
to kill the Fifteenth Princess.

00:06:57.745 --> 00:07:00.625
The killer should be the man in black
who attacked us.

00:07:01.425 --> 00:07:03.985
But if he and Cui Manshu were accomplices,

00:07:04.065 --> 00:07:06.345
why would he suddenly want her dead?

00:07:07.545 --> 00:07:09.065
If the two fell out…

00:07:14.465 --> 00:07:16.625
After setting the fire,
he hid under the stage.

00:07:17.305 --> 00:07:19.465
Then he slipped out of the palace
with the Uyghur prince's entourage.

00:07:20.305 --> 00:07:21.265
He attacked you first.

00:07:22.105 --> 00:07:23.705
Then he headed
to the Palace Domestic Service

00:07:23.785 --> 00:07:24.985
and killed Liu Deyi.

00:07:25.065 --> 00:07:27.385
There wouldn't have been
enough time for him to then go

00:07:28.025 --> 00:07:29.625
to Yanshou Ward to kill Cui Manshu.

00:07:29.705 --> 00:07:32.345
Someone else killed Cui Manshu.

00:07:39.305 --> 00:07:41.345
But if one person
killed the Fifteenth Princess

00:07:41.865 --> 00:07:43.785
and another avenged her,

00:07:44.665 --> 00:07:47.265
then those three Noble Ladies
who worked with Cui Manshu

00:07:47.345 --> 00:07:48.545
could be killed

00:07:49.665 --> 00:07:50.905
by the very same person.

00:07:51.785 --> 00:07:54.825
From what you know of the Princess,
who would avenge her?

00:07:56.425 --> 00:07:59.305
If I could choose, I'd want it to be me.

00:08:00.665 --> 00:08:03.225
Finding the killer is avenging her too.

00:08:04.585 --> 00:08:09.225
Cui Manshu's wound was very deep,
and the blade went in at a downward angle.

00:08:09.305 --> 00:08:12.065
That means the killer was taller than her
and struck with great force.

00:08:13.145 --> 00:08:14.905
If the killer found that residence
in Yanshou Ward,

00:08:14.985 --> 00:08:17.225
they must know the bad blood
between the Princess and Cui Manshu.

00:08:17.985 --> 00:08:19.665
They avenged the Princess so decisively.

00:08:20.385 --> 00:08:23.225
They're either a loyal servant
or someone deeply devoted to her.

00:08:26.105 --> 00:08:27.745
I'll go talk to Wanshun's maid.

00:08:36.745 --> 00:08:37.865
The poison hasn't been cleared.

00:08:37.945 --> 00:08:38.825
Your Ladyship should rest.

00:08:39.985 --> 00:08:42.185
Finding the killer
is avenging the Princess.

00:08:42.264 --> 00:08:43.105
Your words.

00:08:48.585 --> 00:08:50.225
Your Ladyship
is always risking your life like this.

00:08:52.465 --> 00:08:53.305
Are you worried about me?

00:08:53.945 --> 00:08:55.385
Saving you wasn't easy.

00:08:55.465 --> 00:08:56.705
I don't want it to be for nothing.

00:08:59.425 --> 00:09:02.305
Yesterday, you defended me
in front of Zhou Helan.

00:09:02.385 --> 00:09:03.425
I haven't thanked you yet.

00:09:05.065 --> 00:09:07.065
Zhou Helan overstepped,

00:09:07.145 --> 00:09:09.785
speaking of your parents that way.

00:09:09.865 --> 00:09:11.185
I only did what I should.

00:09:12.025 --> 00:09:14.905
So you know about what happened
at the Prince of Duan's manor.

00:09:15.745 --> 00:09:16.825
Fifteen years ago,

00:09:17.345 --> 00:09:19.385
the massacre at the Prince of Duan's manor
shook the court.

00:09:19.465 --> 00:09:21.665
I was already studying
at the Astronomical Bureau then,

00:09:21.745 --> 00:09:22.745
but I heard of it.

00:09:24.665 --> 00:09:26.825
But Zhou Helan wasn't wrong.

00:09:27.385 --> 00:09:28.625
I have no parents.

00:09:28.705 --> 00:09:32.185
I truly don't know what it's like
to have your father and mother

00:09:32.265 --> 00:09:33.265
controlled by someone else.

00:09:39.265 --> 00:09:40.825
You little lunatic!

00:09:40.905 --> 00:09:42.745
I'll beat you to death!

00:09:43.345 --> 00:09:44.785
If I'm dead, no one
will mourn you when you die.

00:09:44.865 --> 00:09:47.905
Do you want a reward for treating
yourself like this?

00:09:48.745 --> 00:09:50.865
Old fool, I'm still poisoned.

00:09:50.945 --> 00:09:52.105
Relax.

00:09:52.185 --> 00:09:54.665
With my medicine, you won't die!

00:09:54.745 --> 00:09:57.145
JUSTICE AND INTEGRITY

00:09:58.225 --> 00:10:01.105
I'm taking these to buy tonics.

00:10:01.865 --> 00:10:02.825
You…!

00:10:03.465 --> 00:10:07.305
You were lucky you didn't eat that dish.

00:10:07.385 --> 00:10:09.345
Good thing I don't eat fish.

00:10:10.425 --> 00:10:11.545
You don't eat fish?

00:10:12.865 --> 00:10:14.585
When you buy me a meal,
don't order sliced raw fish.

00:10:18.905 --> 00:10:22.185
{\an8}XINGQING PALACE

00:10:32.025 --> 00:10:34.865
These were Her Highness's
usual handkerchiefs and belongings.

00:10:34.945 --> 00:10:37.585
Have a look, Your Ladyship.
See if there are any clues.

00:10:50.305 --> 00:10:52.225
- Your Ladyship.
- Mr. Xiao, did you find anything?

00:10:52.305 --> 00:10:54.065
Lin Ning watched
Yunchui House's back gate yesterday.

00:10:54.145 --> 00:10:56.945
He said he saw a man in black
who looked like our suspect run out.

00:10:57.025 --> 00:10:59.025
But then a flock of carrier pigeons

00:10:59.105 --> 00:11:01.065
blocked his path,
and the man slipped away.

00:11:02.265 --> 00:11:05.065
The pigeons' release
and return times are fixed.

00:11:05.145 --> 00:11:05.985
Did you check?

00:11:06.905 --> 00:11:07.785
Lin Ning lied.

00:11:07.865 --> 00:11:10.945
That's still not enough
to make him a suspect.

00:11:11.025 --> 00:11:13.025
There's one more thing to confirm.

00:11:26.625 --> 00:11:28.785
That night, after Lin Ning led a squad
to escort the Uyghur prince

00:11:28.865 --> 00:11:30.345
to the guest house
of the Court of State Ceremonial,

00:11:30.425 --> 00:11:31.305
did you split up?

00:11:31.385 --> 00:11:34.145
We escorted the prince
out of the palace together,

00:11:34.225 --> 00:11:36.025
but Lin Ning left midway.

00:11:36.105 --> 00:11:39.505
Later, we met again
outside Yanshou Ward's gate.

00:11:40.585 --> 00:11:42.705
- You may leave.
- Yes.

00:12:06.465 --> 00:12:07.985
"Like reeds,
my love is soft yet resilient.

00:12:08.625 --> 00:12:09.905
Like rock, it is enduring and steadfast."

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:14.425
Lin Ning was the one
deeply devoted to Wanshun.

00:12:19.585 --> 00:12:20.945
Lin Ning's right foot
turns outward when he walks,

00:12:21.025 --> 00:12:23.025
so the outer sole is worn,

00:12:23.105 --> 00:12:25.025
which matches the footprints
we found in Yanshou Ward.

00:12:35.345 --> 00:12:37.705
He likely never noticed it himself.

00:12:44.385 --> 00:12:46.785
We got Mr. Xiao's message
and came for Lin Ning.

00:12:46.865 --> 00:12:48.745
He's gone. He fled long ago.

00:12:51.305 --> 00:12:52.665
Trade caravans have been
coming and going lately.

00:12:53.265 --> 00:12:55.425
He may have slipped out with one.

00:12:56.265 --> 00:12:58.785
- Check inns and the city gates.
- Understood.

00:12:58.865 --> 00:13:00.505
No. Head to the pier.

00:13:01.545 --> 00:13:02.625
The pier?

00:13:03.665 --> 00:13:04.505
How did Her Ladyship know?

00:13:05.225 --> 00:13:06.105
Where is Lin Ning from?

00:13:07.185 --> 00:13:08.145
Jinling.

00:13:13.785 --> 00:13:15.265
‪GUANGTONG FERRY

00:13:24.185 --> 00:13:26.025
Sir, cast off.

00:14:03.105 --> 00:14:04.345
GUANGTONG FERRY

00:14:10.145 --> 00:14:12.585
- Anyone bound for Jinling today?
- Yes.

00:14:12.665 --> 00:14:16.265
Was there a man who was over six chi tall
and in a hurry?

00:14:16.345 --> 00:14:17.185
He likely chartered a boat.

00:14:17.785 --> 00:14:20.425
Yes, there was. He hired a small boat.

00:14:20.505 --> 00:14:21.345
Get me a fast boat.

00:14:21.425 --> 00:14:22.945
Yes, please board.

00:14:23.625 --> 00:14:24.665
You four, follow me.

00:14:24.745 --> 00:14:26.185
The rest of you, protect Mr. Xiao.

00:14:38.185 --> 00:14:39.185
Faster. Pull alongside.

00:14:45.265 --> 00:14:47.745
Your Ladyship, is that fire?

00:15:23.945 --> 00:15:25.505
Too late again.

00:15:26.185 --> 00:15:28.425
Did the Princess's killer
murder Lin Ning too?

00:15:30.265 --> 00:15:32.425
Your Ladyship, you look unwell.

00:15:33.705 --> 00:15:34.545
I'm fine.

00:15:35.385 --> 00:15:38.065
Your Ladyship,
you were poisoned not long ago.

00:15:38.145 --> 00:15:39.625
Your body might not hold up.

00:15:39.705 --> 00:15:41.465
Perhaps you should go back and rest.

00:15:42.705 --> 00:15:43.625
Fine.

00:15:44.745 --> 00:15:47.265
Bring Lin Ning's body back
to the Palace Investigation Bureau.

00:15:56.145 --> 00:15:57.385
Don't come over!

00:16:00.705 --> 00:16:02.425
I've never taken a single step
beyond the Western Capital.

00:16:03.905 --> 00:16:07.505
This time, I get to see the world outside.

00:16:08.105 --> 00:16:09.225
I'm glad.

00:16:27.465 --> 00:16:28.305
Mr. Xiao.

00:16:32.025 --> 00:16:33.145
This wound…

00:16:44.585 --> 00:16:46.385
Why is this in Lin Ning's bundle?

00:16:51.025 --> 00:16:52.825
- We've been fooled.
- By Lin Ning?

00:16:52.905 --> 00:16:55.105
No, by the Princess.

00:17:03.065 --> 00:17:04.424
Has the Princess
of Fuchang County been here?

00:17:06.265 --> 00:17:07.665
What are you burning?

00:17:08.545 --> 00:17:10.665
Her Highness's embroidery patterns.

00:17:11.184 --> 00:17:12.224
Now that she's gone,

00:17:12.825 --> 00:17:14.704
no one else can stitch them.

00:17:32.105 --> 00:17:32.905
A STAR HAS APPEARED IN THE GIRL MANSION
IT IS A MOST OMINOUS SIGN

00:17:32.985 --> 00:17:33.825
ON THE WUWU DAY OF THE FIRST MONTH
THE STAR HAS APPEARED

00:18:22.265 --> 00:18:23.105
Your Ladyship.

00:18:24.745 --> 00:18:26.265
You've figured it out?

00:18:30.225 --> 00:18:31.825
Lin Ning was the one
who attacked me that night.

00:18:32.705 --> 00:18:34.225
If Lin Ning was the man in black,

00:18:34.305 --> 00:18:36.025
he escorted the Uyghur prince,

00:18:36.105 --> 00:18:38.465
attacked Mr. Gu and me,
then killed Liu Deyi.

00:18:39.065 --> 00:18:41.185
He had no time to kill Cui Manshu.

00:18:43.225 --> 00:18:44.785
Lin Ning was one killer,

00:18:46.145 --> 00:18:47.225
but not the only one.

00:18:48.785 --> 00:18:50.265
The other is hiding

00:18:51.345 --> 00:18:54.345
even deeper in the shadows,
silent and unseen.

00:18:56.065 --> 00:18:57.785
Nothing escapes you.

00:18:59.985 --> 00:19:01.105
Even if the black clothes
have been destroyed,

00:19:01.185 --> 00:19:03.545
if I insist on an autopsy
on the Fifteenth Princess,

00:19:03.625 --> 00:19:07.105
her so-called remains will give her away.

00:19:07.705 --> 00:19:10.985
Besides, Lin Ning's cause of death
will be clear soon enough.

00:19:12.025 --> 00:19:13.025
So,

00:19:13.625 --> 00:19:15.265
how did Your Ladyship find the evidence

00:19:15.345 --> 00:19:16.905
pointing straight
to the Fifteenth Princess?

00:19:22.065 --> 00:19:23.225
That embroidery pattern.

00:19:24.065 --> 00:19:25.945
Only Wanshun could have stitched it.

00:19:28.345 --> 00:19:29.225
But in truth,

00:19:30.545 --> 00:19:31.905
you already suspected

00:19:33.025 --> 00:19:35.425
the Princess faked her death
back at Yunchui House, didn't you?

00:19:37.025 --> 00:19:37.905
You don't eat fish.

00:19:37.985 --> 00:19:39.825
Not even Inspector Du knew that.

00:19:39.905 --> 00:19:41.305
I'm sure it wasn't a coincidence.

00:19:44.225 --> 00:19:45.745
You've found the Princess
ahead of the others.

00:19:47.065 --> 00:19:48.345
What are you planning to do?

00:19:49.025 --> 00:19:49.865
I don't know.

00:19:52.185 --> 00:19:55.185
Truly, I don't.

00:19:57.585 --> 00:19:59.785
If Wanshun wants to return to the palace,

00:20:00.545 --> 00:20:03.505
I'll take her back,
tell His Majesty everything,

00:20:04.185 --> 00:20:06.545
and kneel before Xingqing Palace
to plead for her.

00:20:06.625 --> 00:20:08.385
And if she wants to leave?

00:20:12.105 --> 00:20:14.585
Everyone has to pay for what they've done.

00:20:15.785 --> 00:20:16.745
The Princess is no exception.

00:20:17.705 --> 00:20:20.105
So you want me to arrest my best friend?

00:20:21.385 --> 00:20:22.785
If you've made up your mind,

00:20:23.545 --> 00:20:24.665
I won't be able to change it.

00:20:24.745 --> 00:20:25.985
Then why did you rush here?

00:20:26.065 --> 00:20:27.145
Even if I can't stop you,

00:20:28.265 --> 00:20:29.185
I still must try.

00:20:39.545 --> 00:20:41.265
His Majesty ordered me
to help you solve this case

00:20:42.225 --> 00:20:43.145
and find the real killer.

00:20:43.665 --> 00:20:45.105
It's my duty.

00:20:45.625 --> 00:20:46.785
I cannot shirk it.

00:20:56.145 --> 00:20:57.105
Mr. Xiao,

00:20:58.785 --> 00:21:00.065
go to His Majesty.

00:21:03.225 --> 00:21:06.025
Go and tell him the truth now.

00:21:09.545 --> 00:21:11.025
As for your question, I've decided.

00:21:11.705 --> 00:21:14.625
If Wanshun wants to leave,
I'll risk my life to help her leave.

00:21:15.225 --> 00:21:16.905
Then I'll go and confess to His Majesty.

00:21:16.985 --> 00:21:20.745
I'll trade my life for hers.

00:21:21.745 --> 00:21:22.985
That's the price I'll pay.

00:21:54.345 --> 00:21:55.305
Wanshun.

00:21:57.945 --> 00:21:59.265
You found me.

00:22:35.425 --> 00:22:37.305
The day I met Lin Ning

00:22:39.105 --> 00:22:40.665
was also the Lantern Festival.

00:22:45.465 --> 00:22:50.665
- Bravo!
- Wonderful!

00:22:52.945 --> 00:22:59.345
- Bravo!
- Wonderful!

00:23:08.105 --> 00:23:08.945
Nice!

00:23:10.225 --> 00:23:11.225
Amazing!

00:23:29.625 --> 00:23:31.665
Miss, are you all right?

00:23:37.585 --> 00:23:38.425
I'm fine.

00:23:39.025 --> 00:23:42.745
At first, we didn't know
each other's identities.

00:23:43.265 --> 00:23:46.305
It was chance meetings in the palace
that revealed the truth.

00:23:47.065 --> 00:23:51.105
I thought it was fate.

00:23:52.585 --> 00:23:54.025
I lost my mother young.

00:23:54.545 --> 00:23:56.825
Just surviving was hard enough.

00:23:57.345 --> 00:24:01.585
I never dreamed I'd be loved
until I met him.

00:24:02.345 --> 00:24:04.345
I hesitated a long time before giving

00:24:04.905 --> 00:24:06.945
this relationship my whole heart.

00:24:07.505 --> 00:24:10.305
No man had ever treated me like that.

00:24:11.225 --> 00:24:14.065
Suddenly, I started to hope

00:24:14.705 --> 00:24:18.145
to spend the rest of my life with someone.

00:24:18.665 --> 00:24:20.185
But then,

00:24:20.265 --> 00:24:22.185
Father's oral decree came,

00:24:22.265 --> 00:24:25.705
and I was to marry
a Uyghur prince I'd never met.

00:24:26.225 --> 00:24:28.185
I tried to beg Father.

00:24:29.985 --> 00:24:34.105
I know you tried everything to help too,

00:24:34.745 --> 00:24:37.585
hoping he'd change his mind.

00:24:37.665 --> 00:24:39.185
But this concerned the state.

00:24:39.745 --> 00:24:42.545
How could our pleas change anything?

00:24:43.425 --> 00:24:45.505
So Lin Ning and I

00:24:46.505 --> 00:24:50.785
planned the banquet fire.

00:24:52.265 --> 00:24:53.665
I faked my death and slipped away.

00:24:54.705 --> 00:24:56.225
Only later did I realize

00:24:57.865 --> 00:25:00.025
you weren't just comforting me back then.

00:25:01.225 --> 00:25:02.705
You were saying goodbye.

00:25:04.625 --> 00:25:06.465
I made the plan,

00:25:07.585 --> 00:25:09.905
and Lin Ning carried it out.

00:25:10.505 --> 00:25:12.625
It was flawless.

00:25:13.265 --> 00:25:14.385
It was a show

00:25:14.945 --> 00:25:17.505
even better
than the Lantern Festival banquet.

00:25:25.305 --> 00:25:26.865
Before I entered the secret passage,

00:25:26.945 --> 00:25:31.145
I left the bones and gold bangle
I'd prepared on the stage

00:25:31.225 --> 00:25:34.065
to make it appear I'd burned to death.

00:25:35.145 --> 00:25:38.385
I changed into the clothes
and oiled boots Lin Ning prepared

00:25:38.465 --> 00:25:39.905
and went to the exit to meet him.

00:25:45.545 --> 00:25:46.345
Come out.

00:25:47.305 --> 00:25:48.185
Hurry.

00:25:49.705 --> 00:25:51.265
Let's go. Come on.

00:25:52.465 --> 00:25:53.385
Let's go.

00:27:06.225 --> 00:27:08.305
I ran along the Qingming Canal.

00:27:09.625 --> 00:27:11.465
With every step away from the palace,

00:27:11.985 --> 00:27:15.185
I felt closer to happiness.

00:27:15.265 --> 00:27:19.585
From then on,
there would be no Fifteenth Princess.

00:27:20.385 --> 00:27:23.985
I'd finally be able to leave
those prison-like walls behind

00:27:24.705 --> 00:27:26.145
and roam the world with him.

00:27:26.905 --> 00:27:29.145
I'd never wanted anything more,

00:27:31.185 --> 00:27:34.065
until I pushed open that courtyard gate.

00:27:42.265 --> 00:27:45.625
So this is the wedding robe
you made for yourself?

00:27:45.705 --> 00:27:47.985
The stitching's decent,

00:27:48.505 --> 00:27:50.145
but the fabric is cheap.

00:27:50.225 --> 00:27:52.385
For a wedding robe,

00:27:52.465 --> 00:27:55.385
you should've sold everything
and bought better cloth.

00:27:56.305 --> 00:27:58.105
Come fix it for me.

00:27:58.185 --> 00:28:00.025
It's a bit tight on me.

00:28:00.105 --> 00:28:01.225
What are you doing here?

00:28:02.625 --> 00:28:04.865
Who should be here, then?

00:28:05.865 --> 00:28:06.865
Lin Ning?

00:28:09.705 --> 00:28:11.145
You're a princess all right.

00:28:11.665 --> 00:28:14.905
Faking your death just to elope?

00:28:16.385 --> 00:28:19.025
That kind of nerve is beyond most people.

00:28:22.665 --> 00:28:23.945
Where is Lin Ning?

00:28:26.065 --> 00:28:27.345
Tell me.

00:28:27.425 --> 00:28:30.305
If His Majesty saw these embroideries,

00:28:31.265 --> 00:28:33.185
how would he react?

00:28:34.745 --> 00:28:38.625
Would he praise your skill or be furious

00:28:38.705 --> 00:28:42.465
that you, his daughter,
shamed the royal name?

00:28:45.185 --> 00:28:46.585
Now, you can

00:28:46.665 --> 00:28:49.265
either vanish among the commonfolk
with no name

00:28:49.345 --> 00:28:52.665
or go back for punishment
and lose your title.

00:28:53.225 --> 00:28:56.625
Either way, you'll be a joke.

00:29:00.905 --> 00:29:02.065
Do you regret it?

00:29:05.825 --> 00:29:07.345
Do you regret

00:29:07.425 --> 00:29:10.705
gifting His Majesty
that double-sided embroidered piece?

00:29:10.785 --> 00:29:15.145
Do you regret standing up
for Zhou Helan at my birthday banquet?

00:29:16.665 --> 00:29:17.745
Oh, Wanshun.

00:29:18.465 --> 00:29:22.025
Watching you dance on stage tonight,
so earnest,

00:29:22.105 --> 00:29:24.185
so devoted,

00:29:24.265 --> 00:29:27.065
I laughed so hard.

00:29:28.225 --> 00:29:29.305
You knew

00:29:30.665 --> 00:29:32.385
it was your last dance, didn't you?

00:29:39.385 --> 00:29:40.985
How did you find this place?

00:29:42.145 --> 00:29:43.545
Why are you here?

00:29:48.145 --> 00:29:50.225
I know far more than this place.

00:29:50.825 --> 00:29:53.705
The two of you first met
at the Lantern Festival.

00:29:53.785 --> 00:29:57.305
If I hadn't had that busker
throw an iron ball at you,

00:29:57.385 --> 00:29:59.625
would Lin Ning have had
the chance to play hero?

00:30:00.385 --> 00:30:03.025
Did you like the pendant he gave you?

00:30:05.585 --> 00:30:06.425
I rewarded him with it.

00:30:09.385 --> 00:30:11.945
As for your fake death
at the banquet tonight,

00:30:12.465 --> 00:30:14.345
do you think
Lin Ning could pull it off alone?

00:30:15.625 --> 00:30:20.025
Even this residence was rented by me.

00:30:23.625 --> 00:30:28.225
I know about every meeting
and tryst of yours,

00:30:28.745 --> 00:30:31.145
down to the last detail.

00:30:32.385 --> 00:30:33.545
Oh, right.

00:30:34.465 --> 00:30:35.305
Look.

00:30:36.265 --> 00:30:39.825
He even shared this with me.

00:30:41.265 --> 00:30:42.865
To us,

00:30:43.585 --> 00:30:47.065
whether you wear this robe or not

00:30:47.585 --> 00:30:49.105
makes no difference.

00:30:51.825 --> 00:30:54.065
In fact, I even had a hand

00:30:56.905 --> 00:30:59.345
in your betrothal to the Uyghur prince.

00:31:01.745 --> 00:31:06.065
It's a pity that Lin Ning never meant
to leave the Western Capital.

00:31:06.705 --> 00:31:07.945
And why would he?

00:31:08.025 --> 00:31:11.585
Who would trade status,
wealth, and comfort

00:31:11.665 --> 00:31:14.185
for a life with a "dead girl" on the run,

00:31:14.265 --> 00:31:18.185
constantly wandering
and living in poverty?

00:31:19.705 --> 00:31:21.625
My mother was a dancer.

00:31:22.945 --> 00:31:25.345
After Father favored her, she had me.

00:31:25.425 --> 00:31:26.825
They said

00:31:27.745 --> 00:31:30.585
she suffered terribly in childbirth.

00:31:31.305 --> 00:31:35.065
She died before she even heard me cry.

00:31:36.225 --> 00:31:38.345
Father has so many children.

00:31:39.305 --> 00:31:43.505
He rarely thinks of me.

00:31:44.985 --> 00:31:45.905
I should've known.

00:31:47.945 --> 00:31:50.305
Why would the Left General
of the Imperial Guards

00:31:50.905 --> 00:31:52.585
ever fall for me?

00:31:57.905 --> 00:32:00.425
You're so eager to run off with Lin Ning.

00:32:00.505 --> 00:32:02.745
Don't tell me you're carrying his child.

00:32:04.825 --> 00:32:07.625
What would the Uyghur prince think?

00:32:08.505 --> 00:32:12.265
What would His Majesty do?

00:32:14.025 --> 00:32:17.305
Poor little

00:32:18.705 --> 00:32:19.545
wretch.

00:32:19.625 --> 00:32:21.025
Shut up!

00:32:26.825 --> 00:32:29.185
Don't look at me like that.

00:32:30.665 --> 00:32:33.665
You think I don't know how your eyes melt

00:32:34.265 --> 00:32:35.985
when you look at the one you love?

00:32:39.905 --> 00:32:41.905
You… How dare you!

00:32:44.105 --> 00:32:47.865
If you'd begged properly tonight,

00:32:47.945 --> 00:32:49.385
I would've let you walk.

00:32:49.465 --> 00:32:52.625
And yet, you dared get physical with me.

00:32:52.705 --> 00:32:54.825
Illicit ties with a palace guard,

00:32:55.425 --> 00:32:56.825
faking death, fleeing the palace,

00:32:56.905 --> 00:32:59.385
and startling His Majesty and Consort Shu
at the banquet.

00:32:59.985 --> 00:33:02.465
Any one of those deeds
can get you a death sentence.

00:33:02.545 --> 00:33:05.265
With all the things I know,

00:33:05.345 --> 00:33:07.065
you still dare act tough with me?

00:33:07.665 --> 00:33:09.505
You set me up!

00:33:10.225 --> 00:33:11.945
I'll go back and tell Father everything.

00:33:12.025 --> 00:33:13.585
Are you sure?

00:33:16.305 --> 00:33:18.625
You devised the whole plan.

00:33:19.145 --> 00:33:22.225
You set the fire right before His Majesty
and the Uyghur prince.

00:33:22.305 --> 00:33:24.065
As for the one
who obtained the black powder

00:33:24.585 --> 00:33:26.185
and rented this place,

00:33:26.265 --> 00:33:28.345
investigate all you like.

00:33:28.425 --> 00:33:30.665
You'll never trace it back to me.

00:33:31.185 --> 00:33:33.465
If you want Lin Ning as a witness,

00:33:33.985 --> 00:33:35.545
go on and try.

00:33:36.625 --> 00:33:38.105
I want to know what he'll do too.

00:33:39.785 --> 00:33:41.665
How did you, a female
of the Right Chancellor's household,

00:33:41.745 --> 00:33:44.345
meddle in a marriage alliance
between states?

00:33:45.225 --> 00:33:46.545
Father won't let you off.

00:33:46.625 --> 00:33:49.585
"Father." You say it so sweetly.

00:33:50.585 --> 00:33:52.585
How many times have you even seen him?

00:33:53.225 --> 00:33:57.425
He'd sooner disown a daughter like you.

00:33:58.865 --> 00:34:00.545
If you want to try your luck,

00:34:01.265 --> 00:34:02.465
I'll play along.

00:34:03.065 --> 00:34:05.305
Let's bet this handkerchief.

00:34:05.825 --> 00:34:06.985
We'll see if your father

00:34:07.065 --> 00:34:10.264
trusts me, the niece
of the Right Chancellor and Consort Shu,

00:34:10.344 --> 00:34:13.105
or you, a…

00:34:16.865 --> 00:34:19.304
Here. Wipe up. You're filthy.

00:34:23.744 --> 00:34:25.264
How dare you glare at me?

00:34:28.145 --> 00:34:29.304
What are you glaring at?

00:34:30.025 --> 00:34:31.865
Keep staring,
and I'll gouge your eyes out.

00:34:31.945 --> 00:34:34.784
Don't think being a princess
puts you above me.

00:34:35.385 --> 00:34:37.425
You're just the spawn of a foreign dancer.

00:37:28.705 --> 00:37:29.665
What a shame.

00:37:31.545 --> 00:37:33.385
It was a fine wedding robe.

00:37:34.465 --> 00:37:35.665
She ruined it.

00:37:43.705 --> 00:37:46.705
I should've known
the wedding robe was your work.

00:37:47.865 --> 00:37:49.625
And I missed that the dagger
I gave you was gone.

00:37:50.585 --> 00:37:52.305
They bullied you like that,

00:37:52.945 --> 00:37:54.265
yet you never told me.

00:37:55.345 --> 00:37:58.785
If you'd told me sooner,
it wouldn't have come to murder, would it?

00:37:59.425 --> 00:38:00.625
Before,

00:38:00.705 --> 00:38:02.785
I didn't want trouble.

00:38:04.785 --> 00:38:05.945
But now,

00:38:07.585 --> 00:38:09.345
I don't want to put up with those

00:38:10.105 --> 00:38:14.025
who toyed with me, mocked me,

00:38:15.545 --> 00:38:16.945
or stabbed me in the back anymore.

00:38:21.985 --> 00:38:25.385
You put raw aconite
in the one dish I'd never touch.

00:38:26.105 --> 00:38:28.825
Only you can remember
that I don't eat fish.

00:38:32.385 --> 00:38:34.665
Not long after your parents died,

00:38:35.505 --> 00:38:36.745
you fell into the water by accident.

00:38:37.505 --> 00:38:40.865
Ever since then, you've found
the smell of fish unbearable.

00:38:42.185 --> 00:38:43.705
I'd never forget it.

00:38:46.545 --> 00:38:48.265
As for Lin Ning,

00:38:50.865 --> 00:38:53.465
even in the underworld, he'll carry

00:38:55.105 --> 00:38:57.225
the pattern of "Dragon and Phoenix

00:38:58.065 --> 00:38:59.465
in Blissful Harmony" forever.

00:39:21.385 --> 00:39:22.585
Cui Manshu,

00:39:23.545 --> 00:39:24.665
Wang Yuhua,

00:39:25.465 --> 00:39:26.865
Zhao Luoshun,

00:39:27.865 --> 00:39:29.065
and Zhou Helan.

00:39:29.865 --> 00:39:31.265
They didn't die unjustly.

00:39:32.425 --> 00:39:34.505
I'm the bitter fruit
jointly created by them.

00:39:51.345 --> 00:39:52.265
Of course,

00:39:53.785 --> 00:39:54.825
and you, too.
