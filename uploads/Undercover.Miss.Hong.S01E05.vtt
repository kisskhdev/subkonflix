WEBVTT

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:38.059
{\an8}UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

00:00:42.188 --> 00:00:43.773
That was close.

00:00:43.857 --> 00:00:45.150
I know, right?

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:47.944
What happened here?

00:01:07.839 --> 00:01:08.715
Who's in there?

00:01:25.773 --> 00:01:26.733
Mommy.

00:01:27.942 --> 00:01:29.360
- What?
- "Mommy"?

00:01:30.486 --> 00:01:31.696
What…

00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:49.422
Mom.

00:01:52.008 --> 00:01:53.259
Daughter.

00:01:55.178 --> 00:01:56.221
{\an8}She's your daughter?

00:01:58.056 --> 00:01:59.390
{\an8}I'm sorry.

00:01:59.474 --> 00:02:00.350
{\an8}The truth is…

00:02:00.433 --> 00:02:03.519
{\an8}My name is Kim Bom,
and I'm Kim Mi-sook's daughter.

00:02:06.856 --> 00:02:09.400
{\an8}Did you sneak her in
when you moved in here?

00:02:10.151 --> 00:02:12.904
{\an8}No, she was at a children's home
back then.

00:02:12.987 --> 00:02:14.989
{\an8}I only saw her on the weekends,

00:02:15.657 --> 00:02:17.951
{\an8}but she became curious
about where I lived.

00:02:19.077 --> 00:02:21.663
{\an8}I was planning on keeping her
for just one more night.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.875
{\an8}I told you my chocolate kept disappearing.

00:03:24.684 --> 00:03:25.685
Yehppee!

00:03:28.604 --> 00:03:31.232
KIM BOM, KIM MI-SOOK'S DAUGHTER
5TH ROOMMATE OF ROOM 301

00:03:31.315 --> 00:03:32.525
Only I sensed her.

00:03:33.317 --> 00:03:35.611
I'm quite sensitive
and perceptive, you see.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.990
Where did you sleep this past week?

00:03:39.073 --> 00:03:41.868
I sleep together with Mommy in her bed.

00:03:42.827 --> 00:03:43.911
Wait.

00:03:43.995 --> 00:03:44.829
In our room?

00:03:44.912 --> 00:03:45.747
You didn't know?

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.081
So much for being perceptive.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.876
Hold on.

00:03:50.376 --> 00:03:53.212
You all remember the orientation
from move-in day, right?

00:03:53.296 --> 00:03:54.922
The RA made it clear then

00:03:55.006 --> 00:03:56.883
that no visitors are allowed
under any circumstances.

00:03:58.384 --> 00:03:59.844
That kid cannot live here.

00:04:00.511 --> 00:04:02.764
Mi-sook, this could get you evicted.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.269
Hey, kid.

00:04:08.353 --> 00:04:09.354
What's with the glaring?

00:04:16.903 --> 00:04:20.281
Glaring at me won't change a thing!

00:04:26.245 --> 00:04:28.623
{\an8}ROOM 301 ONCE AGAIN!

00:04:35.755 --> 00:04:38.800
My mommy has no reason
to move out of the dorms.

00:04:40.134 --> 00:04:41.260
Of course, she does.

00:04:41.344 --> 00:04:42.929
Look, kiddo.

00:04:43.012 --> 00:04:45.765
This is the Seoul City Dormitory
for Single Female Workers.

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:48.434
My mommy isn't married.

00:04:48.935 --> 00:04:53.106
My mommy is a single mom,
and she's a single female worker.

00:04:56.692 --> 00:04:57.610
Single mom?

00:04:58.444 --> 00:04:59.779
What about her father?

00:05:02.782 --> 00:05:05.868
He's been unreachable
since I told him about the pregnancy.

00:05:07.537 --> 00:05:08.454
How terrible.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.127
I don't have anyone
to look after her while I work,

00:05:15.461 --> 00:05:17.755
so I was planning to have her stay
at a children's home

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:19.090
just until she starts school.

00:05:19.924 --> 00:05:23.886
I moved in here so I could save
as much as possible until then.

00:05:26.347 --> 00:05:27.974
I'm sorry for startling you all.

00:05:28.057 --> 00:05:29.851
I'm sorry.

00:05:29.934 --> 00:05:31.394
No need to apologize.

00:05:31.477 --> 00:05:33.438
You're still too young yourself.

00:05:35.648 --> 00:05:36.774
But still,

00:05:36.858 --> 00:05:39.694
child-rearing challenges
and dorm rule violations

00:05:39.777 --> 00:05:40.611
are two separate issues.

00:05:41.988 --> 00:05:43.197
Have you no compassion?

00:05:44.532 --> 00:05:45.950
I can't believe kids nowadays.

00:05:46.033 --> 00:05:49.370
We could all end up in trouble
if we're caught and grilled.

00:05:50.955 --> 00:05:51.789
What trouble?

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:53.457
Are you hiding something?

00:05:55.251 --> 00:05:56.085
No.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.008
It's your RA.

00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:03.718
Room 301, open this door immediately.

00:06:04.802 --> 00:06:05.928
I told you!

00:06:06.429 --> 00:06:07.430
Hide her.

00:06:08.431 --> 00:06:09.765
Hide inside.

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:11.142
Go. Hurry.

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:46.802
I heard some shouting earlier.

00:06:47.303 --> 00:06:49.931
"Hey! Glaring at me won't change a thing!"

00:06:56.938 --> 00:06:57.980
Gosh.

00:07:00.024 --> 00:07:01.192
Hong Jang-mi

00:07:01.275 --> 00:07:02.610
started a fight with her

00:07:02.693 --> 00:07:06.447
after gobbling up
all her pricy chocolates in the fridge!

00:07:08.074 --> 00:07:08.908
They're really expensive.

00:07:08.991 --> 00:07:11.661
I was saving them to savor each bite.

00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:15.373
No, I can explain.

00:07:15.456 --> 00:07:16.874
She's got sticky fingers.

00:07:19.585 --> 00:07:21.587
Well, not terribly sticky.

00:07:21.671 --> 00:07:22.505
Just a bit.

00:07:24.674 --> 00:07:25.800
Ms. Hong Jang-mi.

00:07:26.342 --> 00:07:27.510
That's two demerit points for you.

00:07:28.344 --> 00:07:29.178
What?

00:07:29.262 --> 00:07:30.930
Wait, five gets you evicted.

00:07:31.013 --> 00:07:32.306
And I get two, just like that?

00:07:34.475 --> 00:07:36.102
STATEMENT OF REMOR…

00:07:37.311 --> 00:07:38.563
Ms. Hong Jang-mi.

00:07:38.646 --> 00:07:42.066
You can erase one demerit point by writing
a ten-page statement of remorse.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.531
How could I have remorse
when I did nothing wrong?

00:07:51.993 --> 00:07:53.619
I'm really sorry, Jang-mi.

00:07:57.623 --> 00:07:58.958
I know this may sound shameless,

00:07:59.041 --> 00:08:02.044
but could you just let it slide
until the end of the year?

00:08:03.129 --> 00:08:06.215
That's when the exam
for full-time employment is scheduled.

00:08:06.299 --> 00:08:07.925
If I pass, I'll be eligible
for an internal company loan,

00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:10.094
and Bom and I could find our own place.

00:08:11.262 --> 00:08:12.805
I'll write that remorse statement.

00:08:12.888 --> 00:08:15.099
I'll also make sure to teach Bom
to stay out of the way--

00:08:15.182 --> 00:08:16.225
No.

00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:17.643
That would be breaking the rules.

00:08:19.353 --> 00:08:21.230
Besides, what would you teach her?

00:08:21.314 --> 00:08:23.274
To be wary of others and hide?

00:08:23.941 --> 00:08:25.568
To be invisible?

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.199
I'm sorry.

00:08:36.412 --> 00:08:38.289
Hong Jang-mi,
could your words cut any deeper?

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:46.505
Even the King of the Underworld
would show more mercy than you.

00:08:46.589 --> 00:08:47.882
Hey, add your two cents too.

00:08:49.675 --> 00:08:53.304
Perhaps we could strive
for a warmer sense of communal living--

00:08:53.387 --> 00:08:56.182
You all helped me keep my job,
and I'm thankful for that.

00:08:56.682 --> 00:08:58.601
That's why I'm letting it slide today.

00:08:58.684 --> 00:08:59.602
But by tomorrow…

00:09:03.773 --> 00:09:04.690
I'd like the kid gone.

00:09:40.976 --> 00:09:41.852
Room 301.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.993
We've received a report
that some residents

00:09:58.077 --> 00:10:01.288
climbed the wall after curfew last night.

00:10:01.372 --> 00:10:02.623
- Pardon?
- Us?

00:10:02.707 --> 00:10:04.667
- It wasn't us.
- Really?

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:29.900
Where's Mommy?

00:10:31.193 --> 00:10:33.904
She'll be here soon.
Let's wait for her together.

00:10:52.965 --> 00:10:55.342
I'm not kicking you out
because I don't like you.

00:10:56.051 --> 00:10:58.596
We have rules we must follow at the dorms,

00:11:00.055 --> 00:11:02.475
and adults have circumstances
they can't talk about.

00:11:02.558 --> 00:11:03.976
I hope you can understand.

00:11:04.059 --> 00:11:07.521
Please take good care of my mommy, ma'am.

00:11:09.148 --> 00:11:10.524
"Ma'am"?

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:16.947
Bom!

00:11:17.031 --> 00:11:18.240
Mommy!

00:11:40.679 --> 00:11:42.556
Weren't you scared? Are you okay?

00:11:43.057 --> 00:11:44.808
- You didn't get hurt, did you?
- No.

00:11:47.686 --> 00:11:49.188
- You must be hungry.
- Yeah.

00:11:49.271 --> 00:11:50.189
What should we have for breakfast?

00:11:50.272 --> 00:11:51.607
- I want jelly.
- Oh yeah?

00:11:53.192 --> 00:11:55.110
Shall we have some jelly then?

00:11:57.404 --> 00:11:58.572
Let's go and get some.

00:12:06.288 --> 00:12:09.124
EPISODE 5: READY OR NOT, HERE I COME

00:12:12.545 --> 00:12:13.379
Listen,

00:12:14.338 --> 00:12:18.467
having to deal with outsiders
who have a distorted view of our company…

00:12:19.301 --> 00:12:20.594
It's so tiring.

00:12:20.678 --> 00:12:24.098
When you're doing well, people get
jealous and resentful, don't they?

00:12:24.932 --> 00:12:27.810
I, Oh Deok-gyu,
am a man of simple desires.

00:12:29.228 --> 00:12:33.607
My only wish is to lay solid groundwork

00:12:33.691 --> 00:12:38.028
and polish it until it shines
for when Albert inherits the company.

00:12:38.112 --> 00:12:39.154
You know?

00:12:39.238 --> 00:12:40.364
For that to happen,

00:12:41.073 --> 00:12:43.909
I need your help, Mr. Nam. You get me?

00:12:44.994 --> 00:12:46.495
I'm at your service whenever, sir.

00:12:46.579 --> 00:12:47.413
Whenever.

00:12:47.496 --> 00:12:48.372
Is that so?

00:12:49.623 --> 00:12:51.333
Let's have a drink. Cheers.

00:12:51.417 --> 00:12:52.418
- Thank you, sir.
- Drink.

00:12:56.672 --> 00:12:57.506
So,

00:12:58.090 --> 00:12:59.466
have you got any news for me?

00:13:00.718 --> 00:13:04.805
I need to present the chairman
with something ironclad.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.726
- Actually, sir…
- Yeah?

00:13:11.812 --> 00:13:15.733
There's a rumor
that we've planted a spy in Hanmin.

00:13:17.026 --> 00:13:18.569
- A spy?
- Yes.

00:13:19.153 --> 00:13:21.155
- You mean an infiltrator?
- Yes, that's right.

00:13:22.323 --> 00:13:24.491
There's no way
that President Kang was working alone

00:13:24.575 --> 00:13:26.076
to blow the whistle on the company.

00:13:27.036 --> 00:13:28.329
So who is it?

00:13:30.289 --> 00:13:31.332
How would I know?

00:13:48.557 --> 00:13:50.017
Sir, I've got news.

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:52.019
Yesterday,

00:13:52.102 --> 00:13:56.565
I managed to acquire some intel
from a trustworthy source at the FSS.

00:13:57.149 --> 00:13:58.692
Get to the point already.

00:14:01.153 --> 00:14:01.987
Right.

00:14:02.821 --> 00:14:04.031
I heard

00:14:04.573 --> 00:14:07.493
there is an infiltrator in our company
who helped President Kang

00:14:07.576 --> 00:14:09.036
prepare to blow the whistle.

00:14:10.412 --> 00:14:11.705
An infiltrator?

00:14:13.874 --> 00:14:14.708
That's right.

00:14:16.085 --> 00:14:20.005
Well, I guess
with the prosecutor's probe dropped

00:14:20.506 --> 00:14:22.132
and President Kang's accident,

00:14:22.716 --> 00:14:25.094
they may have
already left the company, but…

00:14:25.177 --> 00:14:26.553
We do have a way

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.681
to confirm it.

00:14:40.859 --> 00:14:42.027
Did you look into it?

00:14:42.528 --> 00:14:45.864
The employees President Kang had
the most contact with before the accident.

00:14:45.948 --> 00:14:46.782
Yes, ma'am.

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:50.411
From January 1st, 1997,

00:14:50.494 --> 00:14:52.287
until July 21st,
the day before the accident,

00:14:52.871 --> 00:14:56.458
he frequently met
with three employees in his office.

00:14:56.542 --> 00:14:58.419
Mr. So Gyeong-dong of Trading,

00:14:58.502 --> 00:15:00.045
Mr. Bang Jin-mok of Risk Management,

00:15:00.129 --> 00:15:01.755
and Mr. Cha Jung-il of Research.

00:15:03.966 --> 00:15:05.634
So-Bang-Cha.

00:15:05.718 --> 00:15:06.552
SO-BANG-CHA

00:15:06.635 --> 00:15:08.679
WHISTLEBLOWER = INFILTRATOR

00:15:08.762 --> 00:15:10.848
They're our three candidates then.

00:15:11.598 --> 00:15:12.766
This should be kept top secret.

00:15:31.368 --> 00:15:32.828
When it comes to weeds,

00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:35.748
you must pull them out by the roots

00:15:36.248 --> 00:15:38.167
and burn them to a crisp.

00:15:38.751 --> 00:15:39.835
If you don't,

00:15:40.335 --> 00:15:43.630
they will only grow back
and ruin the whole field.

00:15:44.715 --> 00:15:45.799
Executive Director Oh.

00:15:46.425 --> 00:15:48.927
I'll entrust you with the weeding.

00:15:49.511 --> 00:15:51.680
I'll make them disappear
without a trace, sir.

00:15:59.313 --> 00:16:00.814
PERSONAL DETAILS

00:16:02.983 --> 00:16:06.445
The remaining Yehppee candidates now are
Bang Jin-mok and Cha Jung-il.

00:16:07.279 --> 00:16:09.198
I really hope it isn't Cha.

00:16:12.701 --> 00:16:14.703
Who said you could take away my computer?

00:16:24.838 --> 00:16:26.757
You're making a big mistake right now.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.675
At least tell me why you're doing this.

00:16:28.759 --> 00:16:29.802
Don't just stand there!

00:16:33.597 --> 00:16:34.515
Hey, wait.

00:16:34.598 --> 00:16:35.891
You can't take that.

00:16:35.974 --> 00:16:38.560
- Sir, wait. Hold on.
- Just a moment.

00:16:38.644 --> 00:16:40.938
- Hold on a second.
- Sir, you can't.

00:16:41.605 --> 00:16:42.648
Damn it!

00:16:46.819 --> 00:16:48.362
Why is the Audit Division here?

00:16:49.196 --> 00:16:50.030
The Audit Division?

00:16:50.114 --> 00:16:51.657
Should we get closer for a better view?

00:16:52.533 --> 00:16:54.284
- Seriously?
- Come on.

00:16:54.368 --> 00:16:56.954
What? This has nothing to do with us.

00:16:59.039 --> 00:17:00.999
Take the computers, files,
and everything else.

00:17:01.083 --> 00:17:03.669
Take everything and leave nothing behind.

00:17:03.752 --> 00:17:04.586
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.764
This is our office.

00:17:16.265 --> 00:17:17.474
At least state your business.

00:17:17.558 --> 00:17:19.893
An internal audit into
Mr. Bang Jin-mok has been launched.

00:17:19.977 --> 00:17:21.145
You'll be cooperating.

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:37.244
Word of the internal audit
at the head office

00:17:37.327 --> 00:17:38.954
has even spread to the regional branches.

00:17:39.037 --> 00:17:41.540
If it's So-Bang-Cha,
they must've gone to Trading too.

00:17:41.623 --> 00:17:44.376
These men in black suits rushed in,

00:17:44.459 --> 00:17:46.378
and they cleaned us out in a flash.

00:17:46.461 --> 00:17:48.255
It was really scary.

00:17:48.338 --> 00:17:51.550
Did they say why they were taking it?
Maybe some sort of an allegation?

00:17:55.846 --> 00:17:57.389
By the way, what's an "infiltrator"?

00:18:03.937 --> 00:18:05.606
It's a term that refers to someone

00:18:05.689 --> 00:18:08.358
who secretly invades an organization
and operates covertly

00:18:08.442 --> 00:18:10.402
to achieve a specific goal.

00:18:10.485 --> 00:18:12.070
In English, they call it a "spy."

00:18:12.154 --> 00:18:14.323
I see. A spy.

00:18:15.282 --> 00:18:17.701
Who mentioned an infiltrator
and when did you hear it?

00:18:17.784 --> 00:18:20.329
I heard it in the conference room
after that whole mess.

00:18:39.723 --> 00:18:41.934
I mean, we're nobodies,
so they can treat us however,

00:18:42.017 --> 00:18:43.560
but you don't deserve this at all, Mr. So.

00:18:43.644 --> 00:18:44.853
I don't deserve it, either.

00:18:46.647 --> 00:18:49.107
It appears the chairman believes

00:18:49.191 --> 00:18:51.610
that there's an infiltrator
among the three of us.

00:18:51.693 --> 00:18:52.653
What?

00:18:52.736 --> 00:18:53.737
What infiltrator?

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:57.699
The whistleblower who exposed

00:18:57.783 --> 00:18:59.034
Hanmin's slush fund.

00:19:01.453 --> 00:19:02.913

00:19:21.056 --> 00:19:22.516
That explains it.

00:19:24.768 --> 00:19:25.894
What does it explain?

00:19:25.978 --> 00:19:26.895
Do you know something?

00:19:27.479 --> 00:19:28.397
The chairman's office

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.275
asked me to deliver
the late President Kang's schedule.

00:19:31.775 --> 00:19:34.444
I had to dig it back out
of the scrap-paper bin.

00:19:39.408 --> 00:19:40.534
{\an8}3RD QUARTER SCHEDULE

00:19:40.617 --> 00:19:41.952
Found it.

00:19:44.538 --> 00:19:45.789
What? Why is it empty?

00:19:46.373 --> 00:19:48.792
I went through hell
to open that drawer that night.

00:19:48.875 --> 00:19:50.877
Seriously? It was in the scrap-paper bin?

00:19:50.961 --> 00:19:54.089
Gosh, this is like a purge
straight out of a historical drama.

00:19:55.507 --> 00:19:56.425
Purge time…

00:20:07.477 --> 00:20:08.645
Do you think she's dating someone?

00:20:09.938 --> 00:20:11.148
Look at how spoiled she is.

00:20:11.231 --> 00:20:13.317
She's way too young to have a cellphone.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:14.401
Come on.

00:20:14.484 --> 00:20:17.404
She's still very young,
so her parents probably got it for her.

00:20:17.487 --> 00:20:19.281
You're too soft-hearted.

00:20:19.364 --> 00:20:20.532
Why would you defend her?

00:20:25.871 --> 00:20:28.081
I heard your company's internal audit team
is on the move.

00:20:28.165 --> 00:20:29.833
It's not my company.

00:20:32.085 --> 00:20:34.296
The higher-ups are
looking for the whistleblower.

00:20:34.379 --> 00:20:35.714
They're looking for Yehppee.

00:20:35.797 --> 00:20:37.716
I heard they detained
the So-Bang-Cha trio.

00:20:39.134 --> 00:20:42.387
See, kid? Didn't I tell you?

00:20:42.471 --> 00:20:44.222
It's exactly as outlined in the X-file.

00:20:44.306 --> 00:20:46.808
We must find out who Yehppee is first

00:20:46.892 --> 00:20:48.310
before the evidence is destroyed.

00:20:48.977 --> 00:20:51.063
And what about the favor
I asked you for last time?

00:20:55.817 --> 00:20:57.569
I'm working on it right now.

00:20:59.321 --> 00:21:01.448
Just look at what you have me doing.

00:21:01.531 --> 00:21:04.076
I've been on it for days,
and I haven't even had dinner yet.

00:21:04.576 --> 00:21:07.704
{\an8}I can't believe I'm almost sixty
and folding paper cranes.

00:21:07.788 --> 00:21:10.582
I can barely see, and my hands tremble.

00:21:11.083 --> 00:21:13.251
How am I ever going to fold 1,000 of them?

00:21:14.127 --> 00:21:15.003
{\an8}Yet

00:21:15.504 --> 00:21:16.963
I continue to fold,

00:21:17.964 --> 00:21:19.841
desperately praying
that we find Yehppee first…

00:21:22.052 --> 00:21:23.261
with every crane.

00:21:28.225 --> 00:21:29.810
Let there be hope.

00:21:32.521 --> 00:21:33.480
I appreciate it.

Questions about Hanmin's internal audit?

00:21:57.629 --> 00:21:59.089
Ask away.

00:22:02.843 --> 00:22:05.720
They're even looking into
work hours records.

00:22:07.013 --> 00:22:08.932
ANY SPECIFIC DATE?

00:22:15.605 --> 00:22:19.234
July 21, 1997.

00:22:20.068 --> 00:22:21.862
July 21st…

00:22:22.904 --> 00:22:24.322
Are you Yehppee?

00:22:25.449 --> 00:22:27.701
That was the day
before President Kang's accident.

00:22:29.035 --> 00:22:30.412
It's the day I met him by the Han River.

Wait, Mr. Bang!

00:22:50.682 --> 00:22:54.227
- Let go of me!
- What's up with you today?

00:23:01.276 --> 00:23:02.360
Damn it.

00:23:03.111 --> 00:23:05.197
Aren't you so amazing?

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:07.949
You show up with a whole posse,

00:23:08.033 --> 00:23:11.995
the PR Division photographer,
and even the chief of staff galore.

00:23:12.078 --> 00:23:12.913
Hey.

00:23:12.996 --> 00:23:15.165
You crash a staff dinner,
put on a humble act,

00:23:15.248 --> 00:23:18.960
and for the first time ever,
gobble up some cheap pork belly and soju.

00:23:19.044 --> 00:23:20.545
And you call that
"connecting with your employees"?

00:23:20.629 --> 00:23:21.880
Hey, Bang Jin-mok.

00:23:22.547 --> 00:23:24.299
You ate the most out of everyone.

00:23:25.258 --> 00:23:27.886
Oh, have you been keeping track?

00:23:27.969 --> 00:23:30.263
You must get that pettiness
from your father.

00:23:30.347 --> 00:23:32.098
But then again,

00:23:32.182 --> 00:23:35.143
you wouldn't have a job
if you weren't the chairman's son.

00:23:36.228 --> 00:23:38.104
You act like I signed up to be his son.

00:23:39.231 --> 00:23:41.775
You're the one
who does all his dirty work.

00:23:41.858 --> 00:23:43.568
Isn't that how you keep your job?

00:23:44.402 --> 00:23:45.237
What was that, you punk?

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.154
What?

00:23:46.696 --> 00:23:50.075
Even with titles aside,
you're no match for me.

00:23:50.158 --> 00:23:52.077
Also, I'm one whole year older than you.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.995
Watch your tone, you damn prick.

00:23:54.079 --> 00:23:56.289
That's bullshit.
We started college the same year!

00:23:56.373 --> 00:23:59.251
Who cares? We're only the same age
on the lunar calendar.

00:23:59.334 --> 00:24:00.293
What a petty little bastard.

00:24:00.377 --> 00:24:01.920
Whip out your ID. Go on.

00:24:02.003 --> 00:24:03.088
You want me to whip it out?

00:24:03.171 --> 00:24:04.172
You got it.

00:24:04.256 --> 00:24:06.591
Sure, I'll whip it out for you. Here.

00:24:06.675 --> 00:24:08.176
There you go, punk.

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:09.719
Mr. Bang! Please try to calm down.

00:24:09.803 --> 00:24:12.847
I whipped one out for you. What now?

00:24:12.931 --> 00:24:17.477
I whipped one out for His Excellency,
the great chairman's son.

00:24:18.061 --> 00:24:18.937
You did whip something there.

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:20.021
What now?

00:24:20.105 --> 00:24:21.773
Fine. Mr. Bang.

00:24:22.983 --> 00:24:24.234
I'll go for the throat, you punk!

00:24:24.317 --> 00:24:25.485
Hey!

00:24:25.568 --> 00:24:26.403
Hey!

00:24:27.445 --> 00:24:29.614
- Let go of me.
- Hey, punk. You let go first.

00:24:29.698 --> 00:24:32.659
- You're going to rip my skin off.
- You'd better let go.

00:24:32.742 --> 00:24:33.952
Damn it!

00:24:34.035 --> 00:24:35.578
- Come here, you.
- Let go.

00:24:35.662 --> 00:24:36.913
Look at you go.

00:24:36.997 --> 00:24:38.957
- You'd better let go.
- Mr. Bang, please stop.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.041
- You!
- You!

00:24:41.376 --> 00:24:43.712
- Unbelievable.
- Will you look at this?

00:24:43.795 --> 00:24:44.838
Let go.

00:24:44.921 --> 00:24:46.881
- You let go.
- You let go first.

00:24:46.965 --> 00:24:48.258
Let go on the count of three.

00:24:48.341 --> 00:24:49.759
- One, two.
- Two.

00:24:49.843 --> 00:24:50.677
- Three.
- Three.

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.431
- Unbelievable.
- You sneaky bastard.

00:24:54.514 --> 00:24:56.182
What am I going to do with you?

00:24:56.266 --> 00:24:58.768
Let go. I said, let go.

00:25:10.113 --> 00:25:12.532
Who could President Kang
have trusted with the ledger?

00:25:13.033 --> 00:25:14.617
It seems like
he was surrounded by enemies.

00:25:18.038 --> 00:25:22.042
Bok-hee, did Mr. So also stop by
the president's office on July 21st?

00:25:22.125 --> 00:25:23.543
Could you be more annoying?

00:25:34.054 --> 00:25:36.014
{\an8}3RD QUARTER SCHEDULE

00:25:36.598 --> 00:25:38.391
Mr. So wasn't in that day.

00:25:38.475 --> 00:25:39.476
He was absent.

00:25:42.854 --> 00:25:44.022
Okay.

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:46.983
Sleep tight.

00:26:02.624 --> 00:26:04.959
"The president called for Mr. So,

00:26:05.043 --> 00:26:06.294
but he was absent from work."

00:26:08.088 --> 00:26:11.591
President Kang definitely said
the delivery would happen that day.

00:26:12.842 --> 00:26:13.885
That leaves

00:26:15.553 --> 00:26:17.138
Bang Jin-mok and Cha Jung-il.

00:26:18.765 --> 00:26:20.183
BANG JIN-MOK

00:26:20.266 --> 00:26:21.601
CHA JUNG-IL

00:26:21.684 --> 00:26:23.603
{\an8}BANG JIN-MOK, CHA JUNG-IL

00:26:23.686 --> 00:26:24.854
{\an8}SO GYEONG-DONG

00:26:39.536 --> 00:26:41.955
1997 INTERNAL AUDIT REPORT

00:26:47.585 --> 00:26:50.088
Their computers,
personal files, and call records

00:26:50.797 --> 00:26:52.132
were all reviewed.

00:26:53.633 --> 00:26:56.010
However, we found no evidence

00:26:56.761 --> 00:26:58.221
of any attempted whistleblowing.

00:26:59.389 --> 00:27:00.223
Nothing?

00:27:03.476 --> 00:27:04.727
- Executive Director Oh!
- Yes, sir.

00:27:04.811 --> 00:27:08.565
You stir up trouble with false intel?

00:27:08.648 --> 00:27:09.732
You damn fool.

00:27:10.775 --> 00:27:11.818
Goddamn it.

00:27:14.028 --> 00:27:16.698
Ms. Song, get us some tea.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.074
Yes, sir.

00:27:43.141 --> 00:27:45.435
Am I doing all this for my sake?

00:27:46.186 --> 00:27:48.438
Focusing all your efforts
on Albert's succession

00:27:48.521 --> 00:27:49.606
wouldn't be enough right now.

00:27:50.148 --> 00:27:53.651
Yet you keep going around
proving just how much of a fool you are.

00:27:54.444 --> 00:27:57.113
Imagine if I fell ill and couldn't return.

00:27:57.739 --> 00:28:00.617
You'd be up against
Song Ju-ran and Choi In-ja.

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:02.368
How would you ever beat those two women?

00:28:04.913 --> 00:28:08.208
If you could give me a little more time,
I will dig even deeper.

00:28:08.291 --> 00:28:10.710
That's exactly your problem.

00:28:11.211 --> 00:28:12.921
You tried doing it by the book.

00:28:13.004 --> 00:28:14.797
Now, it's time to try bending the rules.

00:28:16.049 --> 00:28:18.009
Back them into a corner.

00:28:18.092 --> 00:28:19.511
The one with a guilty conscience

00:28:20.053 --> 00:28:21.763
will step forward on his own.

00:28:23.973 --> 00:28:26.226
You have until this Saturday.

00:28:26.309 --> 00:28:27.143
Yes, sir.

00:28:28.561 --> 00:28:29.521
Leave it to me, sir.

00:28:30.813 --> 00:28:32.315
Do take care of yourself, sir.

00:28:55.004 --> 00:28:57.090
Mr. Oh has been summoning
Albert a lot recently, hasn't he?

00:28:59.509 --> 00:29:01.052
Swap out the recorder in that room too.

00:29:02.053 --> 00:29:02.971
Yes, ma'am.

00:29:21.948 --> 00:29:22.782
Mr. Cha.

00:29:23.783 --> 00:29:25.910
I've completed your daughter's
paper-crane assignment.

00:29:25.994 --> 00:29:27.871
She got dumped by her boyfriend yesterday,

00:29:27.954 --> 00:29:29.247
so that's all useless now.

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:30.415
Toss it!

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.090
{\an8}HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

00:29:50.101 --> 00:29:52.896
The company can't treat me like this.

00:29:53.897 --> 00:29:56.190
Before it leaves me out in the cold,

00:29:57.150 --> 00:29:58.526
I'll leave it first.

00:29:58.610 --> 00:29:59.444
No.

00:30:00.361 --> 00:30:01.571
I'll leave it for another!

00:30:02.238 --> 00:30:03.781
I hear Yeouido is even more barren

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:06.534
than the Han River in the dead of winter.

00:30:06.618 --> 00:30:08.661
Ever since the news hit Yeouido Pirates,

00:30:08.745 --> 00:30:13.124
people have been calling
to check in on me for the first time ever.

00:30:18.087 --> 00:30:19.047
You two are

00:30:20.256 --> 00:30:21.257
really innocent, right?

00:30:22.091 --> 00:30:23.635
Come on now.

00:30:23.718 --> 00:30:25.011
You're something else.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:31.726
Enjoying the show?

00:30:35.521 --> 00:30:37.690
On a day like this,
you should be enjoying your booze…

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:40.068
on the company's dime.

00:30:40.151 --> 00:30:42.570
And the most important bit of news

00:30:42.654 --> 00:30:44.864
is that the internal audit
has cleared So-Bang-Cha

00:30:44.948 --> 00:30:46.240
of all charges and allegations.

00:30:46.324 --> 00:30:48.076
- That's hot off the press.
- See.

00:30:48.159 --> 00:30:50.161
Really? There's no infiltrator here?

00:30:50.244 --> 00:30:51.162
Were you hoping for one?

00:30:52.205 --> 00:30:53.289
How could I not be curious?

00:30:53.373 --> 00:30:55.416
There's even a poll on Yeouido Pirates.

00:30:56.125 --> 00:30:57.293
Listen, Mr. Bang.

00:30:57.377 --> 00:31:00.672
I also read on Yeouido Pirates
about the "Mutiny of the Century."

00:31:00.755 --> 00:31:01.589
Did it really happen?

00:31:02.632 --> 00:31:03.591
Yes, it did.

00:31:04.634 --> 00:31:06.511
This is the 101st time
he's been asked that,

00:31:06.594 --> 00:31:08.346
- myself included.
- I see.

00:31:09.222 --> 00:31:10.974
How did you not get fired after that?

00:31:11.057 --> 00:31:12.558
I can answer that for you.

00:31:14.477 --> 00:31:16.604
I believe it was
right before the 1988 Olympics.

00:31:17.146 --> 00:31:19.983
Hanmin ran into major trouble
over accounting fraud allegations,

00:31:20.566 --> 00:31:21.734
and the one who saved it

00:31:22.235 --> 00:31:24.946
was none other than Manager Bang Jin-mok.

00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:26.698
It was all him.

00:31:30.034 --> 00:31:32.829
CONFERENCE ROOM
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.291
Our backs were against the wall
and we were about to be gutted,

00:31:37.375 --> 00:31:39.293
but he clawed out a lifeline.

00:31:42.839 --> 00:31:45.508
You see, he's a whiz
when it comes to numbers.

00:31:45.591 --> 00:31:46.926
He's good at sprucing them up.

00:31:55.643 --> 00:31:58.771
Hanmin made sure
the numbers added up before sending them.

00:32:01.607 --> 00:32:03.693
They can't do that.

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:07.822
Inflated financials, cooked books,

00:32:07.905 --> 00:32:09.657
and audit report wordplay.

00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:11.701
It's all unacceptable.

00:32:21.419 --> 00:32:23.337
But then again, who knows?

00:32:23.838 --> 00:32:26.049
You never really know
what's in someone's heart.

00:32:29.469 --> 00:32:32.013
Cha Jung-il, it sounds like
you have doubts about me.

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.182
Me, doubt the key asset in the shadows?

00:32:34.265 --> 00:32:35.767
Oh, I'd never dare.

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:37.727
- Please eat up.
- Sure.

00:32:38.811 --> 00:32:41.481
Did you make up
with President Kang afterward?

00:32:42.065 --> 00:32:43.024
No.

00:32:43.107 --> 00:32:46.319
They were ready to start a fight
every time they saw each other.

00:32:46.402 --> 00:32:49.530
Whenever he saw me,
he called me the moneywasher.

00:32:49.614 --> 00:32:52.033
He mocked me for doing
what his father told me to do.

00:32:52.617 --> 00:32:54.786
Does this mean
Bang is out of the running for Yehppee?

00:32:54.869 --> 00:32:55.703
BANG IS OUT?

00:32:56.662 --> 00:32:58.831
Honestly, if it weren't for Mr. So and me,

00:32:58.915 --> 00:33:00.291
you wouldn't have survived in here.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.254
Man, I miss Myeong-hwi.

00:33:05.338 --> 00:33:06.172
Let's have a drink.

00:33:10.343 --> 00:33:13.221
Mr. Cha, did you ever
get into a fight with President Kang?

00:33:14.263 --> 00:33:15.556
Come on now.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:18.226
They were high school classmates,
college alumni,

00:33:18.309 --> 00:33:21.437
and even enlisted
in the military together.

00:33:21.521 --> 00:33:22.480
A fight between us?

00:33:23.231 --> 00:33:24.524
Never!

00:33:25.733 --> 00:33:26.943
We have never once fought.

00:33:34.117 --> 00:33:35.201
{\an8}SEOUL CITY DORMITORY
FOR SINGLE FEMALE WORKERS

00:33:35.284 --> 00:33:36.994
Jang-mi has another team dinner tonight.

00:33:39.622 --> 00:33:42.458
The Curse of the Site Inspector Ghost.

00:33:48.798 --> 00:33:52.426
There was a maiden ghost who once dreamt
of owning her own place in Seoul.

00:33:58.516 --> 00:34:00.184
Even after death,

00:34:00.268 --> 00:34:04.438
her resentment drove her to wander
through every apartment building in Seoul.

00:34:04.522 --> 00:34:05.565
That's when…

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.329
Mi-sook.

00:34:20.413 --> 00:34:21.539
Turn the TV off.

00:34:32.049 --> 00:34:34.260
Maybe it's Jang-mi?

00:34:35.553 --> 00:34:37.305
Why would she knock when she has the keys?

00:34:38.931 --> 00:34:40.057
Right.

00:34:40.141 --> 00:34:42.560
It must be the RA, right?

00:34:46.147 --> 00:34:47.023
What are you doing?

00:34:47.106 --> 00:34:48.649
You guys need to come with me.

00:35:35.071 --> 00:35:36.822
Mommy.

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.243
Bom.

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:43.663
How did you get here?

00:35:43.746 --> 00:35:46.415
You're soaking wet. Are you okay?

00:35:46.499 --> 00:35:47.750
What are you doing here?

00:35:49.669 --> 00:35:51.754
Bom, let's go inside. Come on.

00:35:51.837 --> 00:35:52.755
Let's go inside.

00:36:02.807 --> 00:36:03.933
Kim Bom.

00:36:04.016 --> 00:36:06.477
How could you even think
of coming here by yourself?

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.688
Didn't I tell you to stay put
at the children's home?

00:36:09.313 --> 00:36:11.524
I told you I'd be back for you
if you behaved there.

00:36:11.607 --> 00:36:13.526
Why didn't you do as I said?

00:36:13.609 --> 00:36:16.112
Are you going to be a bad girl?

00:36:16.195 --> 00:36:18.239
You promised you'd behave.

00:36:18.322 --> 00:36:19.949
Why would you do this?

00:36:22.743 --> 00:36:24.829
Hey, keep it down.

00:36:24.912 --> 00:36:27.081
We'll all be kicked out
if the RA catches us!

00:36:40.052 --> 00:36:41.470
Hey, Jang-mi.

00:36:43.139 --> 00:36:44.473
I'm back.

00:36:52.023 --> 00:36:54.233
Don't worry, I'll clean all this up.

00:36:54.317 --> 00:36:55.192
Go on inside.

00:37:05.619 --> 00:37:07.496
So you know enough to fear Hong Jang-mi.

00:37:26.474 --> 00:37:27.308
Mr. Cha.

00:37:29.518 --> 00:37:32.480
Why didn't the auditors take his laptop?

00:37:36.192 --> 00:37:37.026
His laptop?

00:37:38.152 --> 00:37:40.363
The truth is,
he's clueless about technology.

00:37:40.446 --> 00:37:43.115
In fact, I was setting up
his laptop that day.

00:37:47.912 --> 00:37:49.455
What do you think you're doing?

00:37:50.081 --> 00:37:52.708
- Take everything.
- Sir, please try to calm down.

00:37:52.792 --> 00:37:53.793
Damn it.

00:37:53.876 --> 00:37:57.046
The auditors simply didn't know
because it was his personal laptop.

00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:01.467
For Mr. Cha, a laptop is no different
from an expensive belt.

00:38:09.308 --> 00:38:11.394
Thank you for calling.
You've reached Risk Management.

00:38:12.436 --> 00:38:14.063
Interesting timing, sir.

00:38:14.855 --> 00:38:16.023
No.

00:38:16.107 --> 00:38:17.149
I'm on my way.

00:38:20.152 --> 00:38:21.237
See?

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.406
He's even asking for help
with his computer now.

00:38:27.701 --> 00:38:30.204
Well, when it comes to computers,

00:38:30.287 --> 00:38:31.539
you're the best in this building…

00:38:31.622 --> 00:38:35.626
I mean, in all of Yeouido,
and no one even comes close.

00:38:35.709 --> 00:38:36.877
Well, yes.

00:38:36.961 --> 00:38:40.214
Yes, right.
Feel free to ask any questions.

00:38:40.297 --> 00:38:41.715
Is there any chance

00:38:42.299 --> 00:38:43.843
you know how to hack too?

00:38:45.511 --> 00:38:46.345
Hack?

00:38:47.805 --> 00:38:49.056
Let's pause for a second.

00:38:49.849 --> 00:38:53.727
Lee Yong-gi is one of the seven
who developed cyber banking

00:38:53.811 --> 00:38:55.396
and a former white-hat hacker.

00:38:57.982 --> 00:38:59.859
That's asking for too much, right?

00:38:59.942 --> 00:39:01.235
Yeah, that's too much.

00:39:01.318 --> 00:39:02.820
No need to strain yourself.

00:39:04.238 --> 00:39:05.197
"Strain"?

00:39:06.073 --> 00:39:07.032
Did you say, "strain"?

00:39:23.799 --> 00:39:24.800
Yeah, no idea.

00:39:37.021 --> 00:39:38.063
{\an8}HACKING IN PROGRESS…

00:39:41.817 --> 00:39:42.651
{\an8}HACKING COMPLETE!

00:39:57.208 --> 00:40:00.753
So you're saying
that this is Mr. Cha's laptop, right?

00:40:01.629 --> 00:40:02.671
You're so amazing.

00:40:02.755 --> 00:40:04.340
That's nothing.

00:40:05.508 --> 00:40:07.676
Now that we've seen it,
we should turn it--

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:08.636
Wait.

00:40:13.015 --> 00:40:14.850
Would you like this?

00:40:14.934 --> 00:40:16.143
But this is so precious.

00:40:16.644 --> 00:40:19.522
They say your wish comes true
if you fold 1,000 paper cranes.

00:40:19.605 --> 00:40:22.775
Mr. Cha had me make them,
so I'm not sure about the wishes.

00:40:22.858 --> 00:40:25.402
Still, you made them with your own hands.

00:40:26.237 --> 00:40:27.530
Well, sort of.

00:40:28.239 --> 00:40:29.073
They are handmade, I guess.

00:40:30.324 --> 00:40:31.659
SNAPSHOTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD

00:40:37.873 --> 00:40:39.083
Wow.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.252
Don't look, Ms. Hong.

00:40:41.335 --> 00:40:42.920
Is he insane?

00:40:43.003 --> 00:40:44.296
Adult content at work?

00:40:45.256 --> 00:40:46.131
What a pervert.

00:40:48.551 --> 00:40:49.635
{\an8}FINANCIAL STRATEGY

00:40:49.718 --> 00:40:51.220
"Financial Strategy"?

00:40:53.556 --> 00:40:55.224
"19970529"?

00:40:58.102 --> 00:40:59.562
It sounds like a date.

00:41:21.709 --> 00:41:24.795
Why did you ask to see me?

00:41:25.462 --> 00:41:28.007
Aren't you the busiest person
at the company these days?

00:41:31.176 --> 00:41:33.012
Surely, I couldn't be busier than you.

00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:39.435
President Kang is
constantly calling you in

00:41:39.518 --> 00:41:40.603
over the slush fund probe.

00:41:41.895 --> 00:41:44.440
I'm just doing my job
for the company, after all.

00:41:47.901 --> 00:41:48.777
What if

00:41:50.362 --> 00:41:52.990
the prosecutors come after
the Outstanding Women Employees' Club?

00:41:57.411 --> 00:41:59.788
I doubt they're capable of
thinking outside the box.

00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:03.751
For this incident…

00:42:06.086 --> 00:42:08.505
President Kang will take the fall.

00:42:10.174 --> 00:42:12.801
An arrest may be unavoidable for him.

00:42:14.136 --> 00:42:15.304
Does Myeong-hwi know this?

00:42:15.387 --> 00:42:17.097
It's what the chairman has decided.

00:42:18.599 --> 00:42:19.850
You just need to testify

00:42:20.768 --> 00:42:24.938
that President Kang led the creation
and management of the slush fund.

00:42:25.022 --> 00:42:28.192
What are you saying?

00:42:29.485 --> 00:42:30.611
Are you asking me…

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:33.072
to betray Myeong-hwi?

00:42:38.452 --> 00:42:41.121
I heard your father-in-law's factory is

00:42:41.997 --> 00:42:43.540
unable to cover its promissory notes.

00:42:44.625 --> 00:42:45.834
At this rate,

00:42:47.211 --> 00:42:48.587
they'll go bankrupt in two weeks.

00:42:50.547 --> 00:42:52.883
Not to mention,
the Mapo apartment under your wife's name

00:42:54.009 --> 00:42:55.511
is about to go into foreclosure.

00:42:59.807 --> 00:43:01.809
The company can prevent both

00:43:03.352 --> 00:43:04.978
if you act in the company's interest.

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:21.036
I'll need an advance payment.

00:43:23.288 --> 00:43:24.832
Please prepare the full amount

00:43:25.416 --> 00:43:28.001
in cash within three days.

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:36.093
So Cha was already working for Song.

00:43:39.596 --> 00:43:43.225
What happened today
will stay just between us.

00:43:43.809 --> 00:43:45.060
Of course.

00:43:45.144 --> 00:43:46.311
I love secrets.

00:43:50.899 --> 00:43:52.443
1997…

00:43:52.526 --> 00:43:54.486
0721?

00:44:13.297 --> 00:44:15.507
Here's what I found on Hong Keum-bo.

00:44:16.592 --> 00:44:20.554
No employee by that name is currently
on staff at the Jeonju branch of the FSS.

00:44:20.637 --> 00:44:23.307
I've confirmed that she's on
long-term leave from the head office.

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:27.060
There are no signs of anyone living
in the apartment under her name in Seoul,

00:44:27.144 --> 00:44:29.480
and it's been a while
since the security guard has seen her.

00:44:32.065 --> 00:44:34.818
Look into her younger sister,
Hong Jang-mi, as well.

00:44:34.902 --> 00:44:35.944
Yes, sir.

00:44:40.365 --> 00:44:41.533
Hong Keum-bo.

00:44:42.284 --> 00:44:43.827
This can't all be a coincidence.

00:44:47.498 --> 00:44:50.292
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

00:44:51.376 --> 00:44:52.711
If the intel is wrong…

00:44:54.046 --> 00:44:56.173
and we fail to flush out the infiltrator,

00:44:56.673 --> 00:44:58.759
we'll lose the chairman's trust.

00:44:59.927 --> 00:45:01.178
Don't worry.

00:45:01.261 --> 00:45:04.056
Grandpa never trusted you to begin with.

00:45:04.139 --> 00:45:06.433
Also, the Audit Division
didn't find a single thing.

00:45:06.934 --> 00:45:08.018
There's no spy here.

00:45:09.645 --> 00:45:10.729
Then we'll need to make one.

00:45:12.105 --> 00:45:13.232
That's how you and I

00:45:14.608 --> 00:45:15.442
will survive.

00:45:18.612 --> 00:45:19.446
Come in.

00:45:24.785 --> 00:45:25.619
Sit.

00:45:26.203 --> 00:45:27.037
Yes, sir.

00:45:35.003 --> 00:45:36.338
On July 21st,

00:45:37.506 --> 00:45:40.259
the day before President Kang's accident,

00:45:41.134 --> 00:45:42.427
what were you two up to?

00:45:49.685 --> 00:45:51.937
I just happened to review
the surveillance footage.

00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:54.314
Mr. Cha Jung-il, around 8 p.m. that day,

00:45:55.065 --> 00:45:56.817
you stopped by the president's office.

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:59.027
And Mr. Bang,

00:45:59.111 --> 00:46:02.364
you conversed with President Kang
in an elevator around 9 p.m.

00:46:05.909 --> 00:46:08.662
That's not quite what you wrote
in your statements to the Audit Division.

00:46:11.415 --> 00:46:12.749
Did you both leave that out?

00:46:19.506 --> 00:46:20.591
Both of you

00:46:21.383 --> 00:46:23.594
will bring me evidence
that proves you're innocent.

00:46:25.637 --> 00:46:26.555
You have until noon tomorrow.

00:46:27.806 --> 00:46:30.225
I can't continue working with a traitor.

00:46:32.644 --> 00:46:34.479
It's for Albert's sake as well.

00:46:49.202 --> 00:46:50.245
Man, that's bitter.

00:46:52.664 --> 00:46:54.833
{\an8}THE NEXT DAY

00:47:06.511 --> 00:47:08.055
Hello, this is Bang Jin-mok.

00:47:08.138 --> 00:47:09.014
Is it ready?

00:47:10.515 --> 00:47:11.808
Thank you.

00:47:24.696 --> 00:47:26.031
Mr. Oh, what's going on?

00:47:26.114 --> 00:47:27.741
It's my dad.

00:47:27.824 --> 00:47:29.242
He summoned Bang and Cha

00:47:29.326 --> 00:47:31.244
to demand evidence
proving their innocence.

00:47:31.745 --> 00:47:33.205
They had until noon today.

00:47:38.877 --> 00:47:41.004
Mr. Lee, let's have a smoke.

00:47:41.713 --> 00:47:42.547
Okay.

00:47:46.176 --> 00:47:47.177
Enjoy.

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:57.062
{\an8}REDIAL

00:47:59.189 --> 00:48:00.607
Sangma Photo Studio.

00:48:06.697 --> 00:48:10.701
{\an8}The primary beneficiary
of the slush fund is you, Myeong-hwi!

00:48:11.493 --> 00:48:14.871
So that's why you sold me off?

00:48:14.955 --> 00:48:17.165
This is precisely why I can't trust you!

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.585
That's a recording from July 21st,

00:48:21.628 --> 00:48:23.338
the day before President Kang's accident.

00:48:25.215 --> 00:48:26.299
It's just as you heard.

00:48:30.137 --> 00:48:31.012
Myeong-hwi

00:48:32.013 --> 00:48:33.140
did not trust me.

00:48:35.934 --> 00:48:36.768
Now,

00:48:37.728 --> 00:48:39.521
that leaves Manager Bang Jin-mok.

00:48:48.321 --> 00:48:49.698
COLOR FILM

00:49:03.837 --> 00:49:05.422
Are you not headed to Mr. Oh's office?

00:49:10.552 --> 00:49:12.387
No, I'm off to see the chairman.

00:49:16.391 --> 00:49:19.978
The chairman isn't someone
just anyone can meet at will.

00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:22.814
COLOR FILM

00:49:22.898 --> 00:49:24.608
I'll need to review that first.

00:49:35.994 --> 00:49:38.246
Cha Jung-il must've handed over
the recording.

00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:40.582
What could Bang Jin-mok have photos of?

00:49:41.166 --> 00:49:42.501
Mr. Bang Jin-mok's order is ready.

00:49:42.584 --> 00:49:43.585
SANGMA COLOR PHOTO LAB

00:49:43.668 --> 00:49:44.878
Here are your photos.

00:49:44.961 --> 00:49:46.338
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:49:54.262 --> 00:49:57.390
On the evening of July 21st,
I ran into President Kang in the elevator

00:49:57.474 --> 00:49:59.309
as I was heading home.

00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:01.478
He was on the phone.

00:50:01.561 --> 00:50:04.231
Something about the conversation felt off,
so I followed him.

00:50:04.314 --> 00:50:05.649
Those are the photos I took then.

00:50:10.821 --> 00:50:11.822
And this woman?

00:50:11.905 --> 00:50:14.866
I followed her
and saw her enter the FSS building.

00:50:16.618 --> 00:50:17.536
Sir.

00:50:18.036 --> 00:50:19.287
I finally found the truth.

00:50:19.996 --> 00:50:21.498
Bang Jin-mok, that bastard…

00:50:21.581 --> 00:50:25.085
I'm certain that
Bang Jin-mok is the infiltrator.

00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:28.964
I demanded the truth,
and he failed to prove his innocence.

00:50:29.506 --> 00:50:31.883
He didn't show up
because he had something to hide.

00:50:31.967 --> 00:50:34.135
We must come down hard…

00:50:34.219 --> 00:50:35.595
Manager Bang Jin-mok

00:50:36.847 --> 00:50:37.764
is not the spy.

00:50:43.019 --> 00:50:44.187
Sir.

00:50:47.983 --> 00:50:49.317
How did you get that?

00:50:52.863 --> 00:50:54.531
Why did Bang Jin-mok

00:50:55.115 --> 00:50:57.367
keep this under wraps until now?

00:50:57.450 --> 00:50:59.828
President Kang passed away
the very next day

00:51:00.787 --> 00:51:02.789
and with the prosecutor's investigation
wrapping up,

00:51:03.707 --> 00:51:05.792
he simply didn't think to report it.

00:51:09.963 --> 00:51:12.507
And what is this woman up to?

00:51:18.179 --> 00:51:21.182
Hong Keum-bo has been transferred
to the Jeonju branch.

00:51:21.850 --> 00:51:23.643
It's unlikely she'll return
to the head office.

00:51:28.607 --> 00:51:30.817
- Executive Director Oh.
- Yes, sir.

00:51:30.901 --> 00:51:32.903
I'm the one at fault for trusting you.

00:51:33.695 --> 00:51:36.698
You can't even break even, goddamn it.

00:51:37.866 --> 00:51:38.825
Unbelievable.

00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:48.919
It ended with my father
barking up the wrong tree.

00:51:51.254 --> 00:51:53.715
So an internal audit was conducted

00:51:53.798 --> 00:51:56.217
to find the whistleblower involved

00:51:56.301 --> 00:51:58.428
in the investigation
of Hanmin's slush fund.

00:51:59.804 --> 00:52:01.598
And President Kang Myeong-hwi
was also involved in it.

00:52:03.183 --> 00:52:04.100
Maybe?

00:52:06.186 --> 00:52:07.020
You may leave.

00:52:07.938 --> 00:52:08.855
Hold on.

00:52:09.981 --> 00:52:12.817
I heard my grandpa asked you to tutor me.

00:52:13.443 --> 00:52:18.365
But it feels like I'm coaching you
on all fronts, doesn't it?

00:52:21.534 --> 00:52:22.827
You're still here?

00:52:39.761 --> 00:52:41.596
That's why Hong Keum-bo
snuck into this company,

00:52:42.764 --> 00:52:45.350
to find Hanmin's slush fund
and the whistleblower.

00:52:50.855 --> 00:52:53.441
Seriously, soup with rice?
This is so petty.

00:52:54.401 --> 00:52:56.987
Mr. Oh treats me
like I'm some bargain-bin pawn.

00:52:58.822 --> 00:52:59.656
No, wait.

00:53:00.448 --> 00:53:02.117
Maybe he's got a big wad of cash for me?

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:04.744
Jeez, I don't want to end up
like the former team manager.

00:53:07.247 --> 00:53:08.873
Hello, sir.

00:53:11.376 --> 00:53:13.545
I thought I'd be nice and feed you
before I said this,

00:53:14.587 --> 00:53:16.673
but now, I think even that
would be a waste.

00:53:18.967 --> 00:53:19.843
Hey.

00:53:20.635 --> 00:53:22.971
Do you know how utterly humiliated I was

00:53:23.054 --> 00:53:25.473
after I made moves
based on your crappy intel?

00:53:26.725 --> 00:53:27.600
Why I ought to…

00:53:28.268 --> 00:53:30.103
Do not call me for a while. Got it?

00:53:31.563 --> 00:53:32.480
Damn it.

00:53:33.356 --> 00:53:34.232
Unbelievable.

00:53:48.121 --> 00:53:49.372
Is everyone working late tonight?

00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:54.294
I'm exhausted.

00:54:14.439 --> 00:54:15.315
Seriously?

00:54:15.398 --> 00:54:17.692
Who would look at this
and know it was you?

00:54:17.776 --> 00:54:19.861
Just go down to Yeouido Park,

00:54:19.944 --> 00:54:22.697
and you'll see tons of
average-looking women like this.

00:54:23.615 --> 00:54:24.824
Jeez.

00:54:25.575 --> 00:54:27.202
Get it together, Hong Keum-bo!

00:55:02.487 --> 00:55:03.363
Bom.

00:55:05.448 --> 00:55:07.283
Bom, what's wrong?

00:55:07.867 --> 00:55:08.701
Bom!

00:55:14.958 --> 00:55:16.126
Hurry up.

00:55:16.668 --> 00:55:17.794
It's almost curfew.

00:55:20.797 --> 00:55:23.049
Wait, I think that was Jang-mi.

00:55:23.675 --> 00:55:24.968
It's almost midnight.

00:55:27.095 --> 00:55:29.556
Hurry up now. It's almost curfew.

00:55:38.898 --> 00:55:40.775
I could've sworn that was Jang-mi.

00:55:42.694 --> 00:55:44.320
Bom, are you in the bathroom?

00:55:50.577 --> 00:55:51.452
Bom.

00:55:52.787 --> 00:55:53.621
Bom.

00:55:56.166 --> 00:55:58.459
- Oh no.
- What is it? Is Bom not there?

00:55:58.543 --> 00:56:00.336
Oh no.

00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:01.296
Bom?

00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:03.214
Bom…

00:56:09.512 --> 00:56:10.346
Doctor.

00:56:11.264 --> 00:56:13.641
Are you not going to do
a full checkup on this kid?

00:56:13.725 --> 00:56:15.059
Oh, just a moment.

00:56:16.352 --> 00:56:18.438
It's a cold-induced fever,
so we prescribed fever reducers.

00:56:18.521 --> 00:56:20.106
- As her mother, you--
- I'm not her mother.

00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:22.483
- Are you her guardian?
- I'm not her guardian, either.

00:56:22.567 --> 00:56:26.654
Then could we get your name
as the person who brought her in?

00:56:27.238 --> 00:56:28.364
It's Hong Keum…

00:56:28.448 --> 00:56:30.325
I mean, it's Hong Jang-mi.

00:56:34.412 --> 00:56:37.290
Ma'am, where's my mommy?

00:56:38.124 --> 00:56:39.459
Ms. Hong.

00:56:39.542 --> 00:56:41.211
Please contact her guardian first.

00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:42.754
I will.

00:56:43.504 --> 00:56:44.422
Are you okay?

00:56:44.505 --> 00:56:46.007
I'm hungry.

00:56:47.133 --> 00:56:48.092
You're hungry?

00:56:59.854 --> 00:57:01.022
Bom!

00:57:04.067 --> 00:57:05.610
What took you so long? I called ages ago.

00:57:06.361 --> 00:57:07.820
The main gate was locked.

00:57:07.904 --> 00:57:09.864
We climbed over the wall
but there were no cabs.

00:57:09.948 --> 00:57:11.324
Bom, are you okay?

00:57:11.407 --> 00:57:13.284
I'm okay, Mommy.

00:57:13.368 --> 00:57:17.163
She had a high fever of 38°C,
but she's much better now.

00:57:17.247 --> 00:57:18.831
They said she can go home
after the IV drip.

00:57:19.457 --> 00:57:20.959
Now that you're here, I'll be off.

00:57:22.126 --> 00:57:23.336
Wait, Jang-mi.

00:57:23.419 --> 00:57:24.921
We'll get demerit points if we go now.

00:57:26.381 --> 00:57:28.716
You're worried about me now
after pulling this stunt?

00:57:29.217 --> 00:57:30.927
Nobody has time for sloppy lies.

00:57:32.178 --> 00:57:34.055
How could three adults not manage one kid?

00:57:37.475 --> 00:57:39.185
RESTRICTED AREA

00:57:50.863 --> 00:57:51.864
Good morning, Ms. Song.

00:57:54.325 --> 00:57:55.159
No need.

00:57:56.244 --> 00:57:57.579
Thank you.

00:57:58.788 --> 00:58:00.456
It's me, Pil-beom.

00:58:03.459 --> 00:58:04.627
What's this now?

00:58:04.711 --> 00:58:07.297
Don't tell me
you two were together all night.

00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:09.299
There you go with your nonsense again!

00:58:10.967 --> 00:58:12.927
Ms. Song, give us the room.

00:58:18.224 --> 00:58:19.142
Enjoy your meal.

00:58:19.225 --> 00:58:20.351
Thanks.

00:58:27.025 --> 00:58:27.900
Pil-beom.

00:58:28.484 --> 00:58:30.445
You need to drink every drop of this.

00:58:30.987 --> 00:58:33.573
This is the detox juice
that Hollywood actors drink.

00:58:33.656 --> 00:58:34.490
Go on.

00:58:34.574 --> 00:58:35.700
Am I an actor?

00:58:37.577 --> 00:58:39.120
It's really tasty.

00:58:39.954 --> 00:58:41.998
Seeing you come running here
at the crack of dawn,

00:58:42.081 --> 00:58:43.958
calling me by my name…

00:58:44.834 --> 00:58:46.919
You must need money again, don't you?

00:58:47.003 --> 00:58:48.671
Not at all.

00:58:50.173 --> 00:58:51.966
The truth is,

00:58:52.050 --> 00:58:54.927
I'm here to discuss President Shin
as a potential son-in-law.

00:58:55.595 --> 00:58:56.471
What?

00:58:56.554 --> 00:59:00.058
I mean, he's handsome with a solid build,
and educated enough.

00:59:00.558 --> 00:59:04.020
I can totally picture him with our Nora.

00:59:04.103 --> 00:59:08.149
If you can picture it,
then I know it's a bust.

00:59:08.232 --> 00:59:09.484
What? Bust?

00:59:09.567 --> 00:59:10.818
Look.

00:59:10.902 --> 00:59:13.404
He may look like some hotshot
on the surface,

00:59:13.488 --> 00:59:16.741
but he's just a glorified puppet
running things on behalf of the real boss.

00:59:16.824 --> 00:59:17.742
Muppet?

00:59:17.825 --> 00:59:20.620
He's no muppet. He's in excellent shape.

00:59:20.703 --> 00:59:21.996
Goodness gracious.

00:59:24.332 --> 00:59:25.416
When the time comes,

00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:29.504
I'll have Ms. Song find Nora
a suitable partner.

00:59:29.587 --> 00:59:31.506
So you just stay out of it.

00:59:31.589 --> 00:59:35.134
But I'm her mother.
Why would I let Ms. Song do that?

00:59:37.428 --> 00:59:39.889
Don't argue with me, woman!

00:59:40.973 --> 00:59:42.308
Come on, Pil-beom.

00:59:43.267 --> 00:59:44.894
Honey.

00:59:44.977 --> 00:59:47.230
- "Honey"?
- Come on, honey.

00:59:47.313 --> 00:59:49.273
- Fine, just don't--
- Stop it.

00:59:49.357 --> 00:59:50.358
Go on.

00:59:50.441 --> 00:59:52.694
Drink it up, to the very last drop.

00:59:52.777 --> 00:59:55.988
There you go. Drink it all.

00:59:56.572 --> 00:59:59.075
{\an8}So when's the blind date
with the chairman's daughter?

00:59:59.158 --> 01:00:00.368
{\an8}Next week.

01:00:00.451 --> 01:00:01.619
I didn't see that coming.

01:00:01.703 --> 01:00:03.246
I thought you'd be repulsed.

01:00:05.039 --> 01:00:08.042
Networks and connections
are all that matter in Korean society.

01:00:09.001 --> 01:00:10.878
You couldn't buy this connection.

01:00:11.546 --> 01:00:13.756
The chairman sees me
as a figurehead president,

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:16.801
a sort of tutor for his grandson.

01:00:17.301 --> 01:00:18.678
All his important decisions

01:00:19.512 --> 01:00:21.973
are made in closed-door meetings
with his chief of staff.

01:00:23.015 --> 01:00:24.642
I'd need to be a potential son-in-law

01:00:25.351 --> 01:00:26.853
for him to let his guard down.

01:00:26.936 --> 01:00:27.770
Okay.

01:00:28.521 --> 01:00:30.606
We need you in those closed-door meetings

01:00:30.690 --> 01:00:32.316
if we want to hit the jackpot.

01:00:36.028 --> 01:00:37.572
A crisis is inevitable.

01:00:39.782 --> 01:00:40.950
We need to seize the opportunity.

01:00:50.543 --> 01:00:51.377
Here you go.

01:01:00.762 --> 01:01:02.513
Here's to another rewarding day,

01:01:03.014 --> 01:01:03.931
respectively.

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.585
{\an8}Sir, here's the final report
on the proposed

01:01:32.668 --> 01:01:33.961
internal system improvements.

01:01:38.257 --> 01:01:40.009
INTERNAL SYSTEM ENHANCEMENT PROPOSAL
BLOCKING OUT-OF-RANGE ORDERS

01:01:42.970 --> 01:01:45.097
In Hanmin's current trading system,

01:01:45.181 --> 01:01:48.434
orders placed by traders are sent
straight to the Korea Exchange.

01:01:48.518 --> 01:01:51.771
Under our proposed safeguards,
orders that exceed 8% of the market price

01:01:51.854 --> 01:01:53.064
will be flagged as erroneous,

01:01:53.147 --> 01:01:55.858
blocked internally,
and automatically marked as unfilled.

01:01:56.818 --> 01:01:59.028
We shut it down
if it's suspicious in the slightest.

01:01:59.111 --> 01:02:00.446
It'll be a trap with no escape.

01:02:01.864 --> 01:02:02.698
Nice!

01:02:02.782 --> 01:02:04.784
Ms. Hong, you'll come with me.

01:02:05.618 --> 01:02:06.452
To where?

01:02:08.621 --> 01:02:09.455
The president's office.

01:02:10.581 --> 01:02:11.916
- Me?
- Yes.

01:02:11.999 --> 01:02:13.000
Why would I?

01:02:13.709 --> 01:02:15.419
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

01:02:17.338 --> 01:02:18.673
SUMMARY OF KEY ENHANCEMENTS

01:02:18.756 --> 01:02:20.967
5. PROJECTED BENEFITS
6. ADDITIONAL NOTES

01:02:24.136 --> 01:02:27.723
Well done, Risk Management Division.

01:02:31.561 --> 01:02:32.436
I must say

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:35.273
this was all thanks to Ms. Hong's
generous guidance and support.

01:02:35.356 --> 01:02:37.608
You mean Ms. Hong Jang-mi?

01:02:37.692 --> 01:02:38.568
Yes, sir.

01:02:39.652 --> 01:02:40.528
Truth be told,

01:02:41.153 --> 01:02:43.406
we did have some dead weight around.

01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:45.157
But it was made possible

01:02:45.241 --> 01:02:47.994
with all thanks to the genius
one-woman army, Ms. Hong.

01:02:48.077 --> 01:02:49.829
I thought as much.

01:02:53.124 --> 01:02:54.166
She hasn't changed a bit.

01:02:55.751 --> 01:02:57.003
Has Choi In-ja

01:02:57.086 --> 01:02:59.213
ever asked for President Shin
through the admin office?

01:03:00.673 --> 01:03:01.757
There were two instances.

01:03:02.425 --> 01:03:04.427
Last week, she set up a dinner.

01:03:04.510 --> 01:03:06.220
And today, she left a message.

01:03:06.304 --> 01:03:07.138
Really?

01:03:09.265 --> 01:03:10.892
She just has to force my hand.

01:03:13.352 --> 01:03:14.520
Surely,

01:03:14.604 --> 01:03:18.065
they can't be an item, right?

01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:28.743
Not with her, but with Ms. Kang.

01:03:30.411 --> 01:03:33.831
It appears Choi In-ja wants him
as her son-in-law.

01:03:34.624 --> 01:03:36.042
The president and Nora?

01:03:36.125 --> 01:03:37.710
I mean, him and Ms. Kang?

01:03:37.793 --> 01:03:41.714
You must let me know immediately
once their blind date is set up.

01:03:43.174 --> 01:03:44.800
Yes, ma'am.

01:04:13.079 --> 01:04:17.375
PERSONAL DETAILS

01:04:17.458 --> 01:04:18.751
YEHPPEE = INFILTRATOR
SO-BANG-CHA

01:04:18.834 --> 01:04:20.002
{\an8}ELIMINATED AS CANDIDATE

01:04:20.086 --> 01:04:22.129
{\an8}FOUGHT WITH KANG MYEONG-HWI,
BETRAYED KANG MYEONG-HWI

01:04:22.213 --> 01:04:23.381
{\an8}THEN WHO IS YEHPPEE?

01:04:31.389 --> 01:04:32.723
NOVEMBER, 1997

01:04:39.021 --> 01:04:42.900
What if the prosecutors come after
the Outstanding Women Employees' Club?

01:04:42.984 --> 01:04:45.403
I doubt they're capable of
thinking outside the box.

01:04:46.862 --> 01:04:47.863
The Outstanding Women's Club

01:04:48.656 --> 01:04:49.824
and Song Ju-ran.

01:04:53.869 --> 01:04:56.288
Jang-mi, come on out
for an emergency roommate meeting.

01:04:56.872 --> 01:04:57.873
Okay.

01:05:08.634 --> 01:05:12.304
I spoke with the children's home director
over the phone,

01:05:12.388 --> 01:05:15.808
and they didn't even know
Bom had been missing for a week.

01:05:18.561 --> 01:05:22.273
She's been here for a whole week,
and they didn't notice she was missing?

01:05:23.566 --> 01:05:25.401
But you didn't know at first, either.

01:05:26.569 --> 01:05:28.779
You only found out after she was sick.

01:05:29.864 --> 01:05:31.032
She's right.

01:05:32.158 --> 01:05:33.034
You didn't know.

01:05:38.998 --> 01:05:40.291
Shall we take a short break?

01:05:46.839 --> 01:05:47.923
I'll be right back, Bom.

01:05:56.432 --> 01:05:59.518
We need to get back in there
with a solid argument.

01:06:00.186 --> 01:06:02.313
How will we ever persuade Jang-mi?

01:06:02.772 --> 01:06:03.814
You were great earlier.

01:06:03.898 --> 01:06:06.859
She didn't even notice Bom was around.

01:06:10.029 --> 01:06:12.531
By the way, who is Hong Keum-bo?

01:06:16.911 --> 01:06:19.080
Where did you hear that name?

01:06:19.163 --> 01:06:21.290
You said it.

01:06:21.373 --> 01:06:23.709
"Hong Keum-bo!"

01:06:26.128 --> 01:06:27.797
Get it together, Hong Keum-bo!

01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:32.218
Damn it.

01:06:33.177 --> 01:06:34.970
Is there anything else

01:06:35.054 --> 01:06:37.515
that you saw or heard?

01:06:38.474 --> 01:06:40.434
Last time, in the big room,

01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:43.562
I saw a rectangular…

01:06:43.646 --> 01:06:45.022
Rectangular?

01:06:45.815 --> 01:06:47.650
It had photos of old guys.

01:06:48.943 --> 01:06:51.320
I saw Auntie Bok-hee in there too.

01:06:56.283 --> 01:06:57.368
Bom.

01:06:57.451 --> 01:07:00.454
You can't tell anyone about that, okay?

01:07:00.538 --> 01:07:01.831
Please?

01:07:03.999 --> 01:07:05.584
- You do it.
- No, you do it.

01:07:05.668 --> 01:07:07.795
Then can you grant my wish?

01:07:09.130 --> 01:07:11.757
I want to live here with my mommy.

01:07:13.342 --> 01:07:15.052
I'll keep your secret.

01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:32.236
Fine. Let's make a promise.

01:07:37.741 --> 01:07:39.160
Mommy!

01:07:39.243 --> 01:07:40.077
Bom.

01:07:56.218 --> 01:07:57.303
Good job!

01:08:06.353 --> 01:08:07.897
BOM CHILDCARE DUTIES

01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:10.149
GO BOK-HEE: STUDIES AND READING
READ HER ONE BOOK A DAY!

01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:11.734
Ta-da.

01:08:12.735 --> 01:08:14.320
- That's Mommy's name.
- It is.

01:08:14.403 --> 01:08:15.988
That's Auntie Bok-hee.

01:08:16.071 --> 01:08:17.448
What are beeper numbers?

01:08:17.531 --> 01:08:20.576
If you're ever in trouble,
you just need to call one of the aunties.

01:08:26.248 --> 01:08:28.000
Now you're even raising a kid?

01:08:29.793 --> 01:08:32.129
If you fight it,
you'll be taken down in an instant.

01:08:35.424 --> 01:08:36.258
Anyhow,

01:08:36.926 --> 01:08:39.428
Cha's situation is
as you heard in the recording.

01:08:39.511 --> 01:08:42.806
Both his father-in-law's bankruptcy
and apartment foreclosure were stopped,

01:08:43.349 --> 01:08:45.851
though it'll be hard to trace
since the payment was in cash.

01:08:46.435 --> 01:08:49.647
Seriously, if it's not
one of the So-Bang-Cha trio,

01:08:49.730 --> 01:08:51.273
then who the hell is Yehppee?

01:08:51.357 --> 01:08:55.069
Yehppee could've switched sides
after all that happened.

01:08:56.028 --> 01:08:57.279
Let's expose that slush fund.

01:08:58.697 --> 01:09:02.117
Up until now, the slush funds hidden
domestically were impossible to trace.

01:09:02.201 --> 01:09:04.703
In the olden days,
bank and securities firm employees

01:09:04.787 --> 01:09:06.830
kept hundreds of
fake bankbooks in their desks.

01:09:06.914 --> 01:09:09.625
Now, they're all fired up
about the real-name banking system.

01:09:09.708 --> 01:09:11.794
Who'd be crazy enough
to lend their name nowadays?

01:09:12.378 --> 01:09:13.837
What if it wasn't borrowed,

01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:16.173
but secretly stolen?

01:09:17.341 --> 01:09:20.010
I found something suspicious
in Cha's recordings.

01:09:22.388 --> 01:09:24.306
That's the Outstanding Women roster.

01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:25.766
"Outstanding Women"?

01:09:26.475 --> 01:09:28.769
HANMIN'S OUTSTANDING WOMEN EMPLOYEES

01:09:29.395 --> 01:09:31.730
Go Bok-hee. Kim I-gyeong.

01:09:33.190 --> 01:09:35.317
Even if their accounts were used
to funnel the funds,

01:09:35.401 --> 01:09:37.695
Hanmin could've paid them off
to play dumb and deny it all.

01:09:37.778 --> 01:09:38.988
What then?

01:09:39.071 --> 01:09:42.574
That's why we need Hong Jang-mi
to become an Outstanding Woman

01:09:42.658 --> 01:09:44.368
and verify it for ourselves.

01:10:25.784 --> 01:10:27.411
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD
KIM I-GYEONG

01:10:29.330 --> 01:10:30.581
{\an8}KIM I-GYEONG
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

01:10:41.633 --> 01:10:42.593
Please forgive me.

01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:44.970
I just got greedy

01:10:45.054 --> 01:10:47.890
after seeing that large sum
suddenly appear in my account.

01:10:48.432 --> 01:10:49.892
I promise to never do it again.

01:10:50.726 --> 01:10:52.853
Please spare me, just this once.

01:10:52.936 --> 01:10:53.937
Right.

01:10:55.314 --> 01:10:57.941
So why would you try to take money
that isn't even yours?

01:11:03.447 --> 01:11:04.281
Come on.

01:11:22.925 --> 01:11:26.720
We took care of Kim I-gyeong's account
at the Songwi Branch.

01:11:27.513 --> 01:11:28.597
Good work.

01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:29.640
Yes, ma'am.

01:12:12.391 --> 01:12:13.475
Wait.

01:12:15.686 --> 01:12:16.728
Yes?

01:12:43.005 --> 01:12:45.257
What an odd resemblance.

01:13:26.381 --> 01:13:28.217
{\an8}UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:29.801
{\an8}What? Were you caught?

01:13:29.885 --> 01:13:31.845
{\an8}Worry about your own risks.

01:13:32.721 --> 01:13:34.848
{\an8}I need to hear the answer
I never got back then.

01:13:34.932 --> 01:13:36.892
{\an8}Why has Hong Keum-bo
lied to plant herself in Hanmin?

01:13:36.975 --> 01:13:39.520
{\an8}I am Hong Jang-mi,
no matter what anyone says.

01:13:39.603 --> 01:13:41.522
{\an8}You want an Outstanding Woman nomination?

01:13:42.022 --> 01:13:44.650
{\an8}Jeez, I was really hoping to avoid
setting a honey trap.

01:13:44.733 --> 01:13:46.360
{\an8}Jang-mi, do you have a date?

01:13:46.443 --> 01:13:48.612
{\an8}There must be money in my account as well.

01:13:48.695 --> 01:13:50.405
{\an8}That money is nothing but trouble.

01:13:50.489 --> 01:13:52.908
{\an8}Who in the world
is this unidentified male?

01:13:52.991 --> 01:13:53.825
{\an8}Jang-mi!

01:13:56.411 --> 01:14:01.416
