WEBVTT

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.200
Brothers

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.840
Commander Fan has orders

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.680
We are not a ragtag army

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.560
When told to advance

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.439
You must not retreat

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.040
When told to stand

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.000
You must not lie down

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.079
You even made me sign a Military pledge

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.280
How do we start now?

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.640
This is our only chance

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:54.519
If we miss it, it'll be hard to kill him later

00:01:55.519 --> 00:01:56.959
Don't look so anxious

00:01:57.879 --> 00:01:59.280
Just follow me when the time comes

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.959
A chubby kid's luck is never bad

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.359
Do you think a Military pledge is a joke?

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.519
That costs you your head

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.680
I'm warning you

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:10.879
Don't act rashly

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.959
Or I'll take your dog life first

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:16.080
Commander, you don't need to supervise personally

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.400
It's just two regiments

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:18.400
Nothing to fear

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.520
I'm here to watch the show

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.120
Gunners, get ready

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.639
Commander Fan, enemies cross paths

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.599
It's you

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.039
It is you

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:40.560
This battle will be easy

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.199
War isn't playing house

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.599
Since we are in an alliance

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.319
You must obey orders and listen

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.319
Understand?

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:52.400
You fleece the people

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.080
Oppress the common folk

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:56.360
Rape women

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:58.400
You son of a bitch are just a pervert

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.319
Listen to you? Why should I?

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.840
Curse him

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.159
You son of a bitch

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.919
Occupying my uncle's cousin's land

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.520
You're really not a decent thing

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:10.719
You also occupied my shop

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:11.840
Driving me to a dead end

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.560
That's why I went up the mountain to be a bandit

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:15.319
None of us will listen to you dog

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.479
That I stooped to ally with you

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:19.759
You ragtag army

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:21.000
Don't push your luck

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:22.639
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:23.680
Dozens of bullshits

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.400
Ragtag army

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:27.639
Ragtag army

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.560
Bootlicker army

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:29.560
Bootlicker army

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.240
Bandit army

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:31.400
Bandit army

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.240
Dung beetle army

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.039
What does that mean?

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.759
Didn't they make a deal?

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:37.280
Interesting

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.400
Pervert army

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:39.639
Pervert army

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.919
Who fired?

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.680
Darn it

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.879
Shooting from the dark

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.879
Take cover

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:54.199
Go

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:55.319
We take cover too

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.520
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.919
Whoever I pick, I hit

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.919
Hit him

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:12.120
Fan

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.199
You need to know what you're here for

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.960
No one will listen to you son of a bitch

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.400
This is called the will of the people

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.800
So should we help

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.000
The fiercer side

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.560
I picked him, didn't I?

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.920
He's lucky

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.639
Want to catch them all in one net

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:29.920
Aren't you making them more united?

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.720
Muzzle left, fifteen degrees

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:33.560
Fire

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.639
Brother

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:07.560
Why did you only bomb them?

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.759
Thank you, Commander Liao

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:18.639
We came here to fight you

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:21.680
Why did you help us fight instead?

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.600
Because you're cute

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.600
So what do we do now?

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:36.839
Do we keep fighting or what?

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:38.519
No more fighting

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.920
You guys go back on your own

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.160
We're in trouble

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.839
He isn't helping you

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:52.519
He wants to break the Chen-Wei alliance

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.879
Helping you...

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.160
...is actually making you the scapegoat

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.240
To make people think you betrayed the alliance

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:59.279
That you turned traitor

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.199
Damn it!

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:02.319
What are you doing?

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.160
Xuanjizi

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:05.519
Why are they locking me up?

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:07.800
Commander, you can't do this

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.720
Commander Fan hit the wrong target

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:11.399
But at least he won the battle

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.480
Retreating safely from a three-way standoff...

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.120
...shows that he is capable

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:16.879
Listen to the crap you're spouting

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.600
I just managed to untie the knot

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.120
And he tied it up again for me

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:21.600
And he tied a dead knot at that

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.399
Division Commander Chen was originally an enemy

00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:25.600
If he hooks up with Liao Guanguan...

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.879
Then we become enemies too

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.240
He is your sworn brother

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.439
He wouldn't turn traitor

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:31.639
If he turns traitor, I'm screwed

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:33.079
If he doesn't turn traitor, I'm also screwed

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:34.680
He dug such a big pit

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.639
And told me to jump in

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.360
This is the "lucky general" you found for me

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:40.199
Do not suspect the one you employ, Commander

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.240
That battle was meant for Nanjing to see

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.600
The effect has been achieved

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.279
But it shouldn't make enemies for me on all sides

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.199
Just listen to my advice

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:48.199
Listen to your advice, my ass

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:49.079
Lock him up

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.120
Commander!

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.879
A blessing in disguise!

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:53.800
A blessing in disguise!

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.839
That Fan Sha'er

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.560
He is just a shit-stirrer

00:06:58.879 --> 00:07:00.959
Commander Qin and I both signed a military pledge

00:07:01.079 --> 00:07:02.160
He still didn't believe it

00:07:02.519 --> 00:07:04.120
No vision, petty-minded

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:05.240
Didn't fire at the enemy

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.439
But fired at his own side

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:08.160
Which caused our regiment's crushing defeat

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.319
Division Commander Chen

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.720
We must kill him

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:12.040
Avenge Commander Qin

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.040
The alliance he facilitated...

00:07:20.519 --> 00:07:21.680
Why would he turn against it?

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.720
He's vicious

00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:27.560
He just wants to kill me to settle a personal grudge

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.600
It was Wei Mangzi who was one step ahead of me.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.920
What ability does that ragtag army have?

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.040
To wipe out Commander Qin?

00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:42.639
Commander Liao.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.680
Commander Liao fought us together with him.

00:07:45.519 --> 00:07:46.279
Liao Guanguan.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.759
It wasn't Wei Mangzi who gave the order.

00:07:50.079 --> 00:07:51.720
It was Fan Sha'er who defected to Liao Guanguan.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.360
It's possible.

00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:56.480
Or...

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.079
Commander Liao and Commander Wei colluded.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.560
Specifically targeting me.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:04.920
That's also possible.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.560
You are the staff officer.

00:08:09.519 --> 00:08:10.920
Can you give me an accurate answer?

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:13.439
It's Fan Sha'er and Commander Liao...

00:08:13.439 --> 00:08:14.199
...who have colluded.

00:08:15.439 --> 00:08:16.720
So what should we do now?

00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:25.199
Wait.

00:08:30.519 --> 00:08:31.120
Brother.

00:08:31.439 --> 00:08:32.360
Something's not right.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.319
What do you mean?

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.519
Commander Wei has orders.

00:08:40.759 --> 00:08:41.679
Disarm and return to barracks.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.080
We just went out for a bit.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.720
You're treating us like the enemy?

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.559
You don't fight the enemy, you fight allies?

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.360
Who knows if you're friend or foe right now?

00:08:48.519 --> 00:08:49.639
If we really wanted to defect,

00:08:49.639 --> 00:08:50.600
we wouldn't have come back.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.399
I'll say it again.

00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:53.840
Disarm and return to barracks.

00:08:53.919 --> 00:08:54.759
On what grounds?

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.799
Try moving and see what happens.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.559
Commander Fan, no offense intended.

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:06.360
We are just following orders.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.720
If we go back empty-handed,

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.279
we'll be meat on the chopping block.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.080
About this matter,

00:09:13.679 --> 00:09:16.200
I should be able to explain it to Commander Wei.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.720
Attention, everyone!

00:09:27.679 --> 00:09:28.480
Put your guns...

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.559
...down.

00:09:35.679 --> 00:09:36.240
Put them down.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.559
This is Commander Liao's stratagem of division.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.080
To break our alliance with Division Commander Chen.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.159
He could have helped Commander Qin fight you.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.919
Why did he choose to help you instead?

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:54.919
He said I...

00:09:56.519 --> 00:09:57.639
He said I'm good-looking.

00:09:59.679 --> 00:10:01.320
You think I'm a dark kid who's never seen the sun?

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.679
A fat kid who's never eaten fatty meat?

00:10:03.919 --> 00:10:05.200
You don't even understand this?

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.519
Surely destroy the strong army and keep the weak one.

00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:09.519
Otherwise keep the strong army for the New Year?

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.320
Who is this brat?

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:13.600
Enough talk.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.720
Just a kid, ignore him.

00:10:18.639 --> 00:10:21.200
I kindly took in your ragtag mob.

00:10:23.159 --> 00:10:24.840
And this is how you repay me?

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.440
What do you mean "took us in"?

00:10:28.919 --> 00:10:31.000
You clearly begged us to come.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:34.480
Drag him out!

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:35.799
Court-martial him!

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:38.480
Commander Wei!

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.639
Every word I said is true.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.559
I, Fan, would never betray a brother.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.480
Please, you must believe me.

00:10:49.559 --> 00:10:51.200
Once you put on this uniform,

00:10:51.879 --> 00:10:53.000
you are a soldier.

00:10:53.679 --> 00:10:54.960
A soldier's duty...

00:10:55.519 --> 00:10:56.480
...is to obey orders.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.279
If you disobey orders,

00:10:58.799 --> 00:11:00.240
never mind sworn brothers,

00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:02.200
even blood brothers must be punished.

00:11:02.519 --> 00:11:03.200
Drag him out!

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:03.960
Commander Wei!

00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:06.080
You've fallen for Commander Liao's trap, don't you know?

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:07.799
I have to do this...

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.840
...to give Division Commander Chen an explanation.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:10.840
Take him away!

00:11:11.759 --> 00:11:12.320
What?

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.559
Stop! Let go! Stop!

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:14.960
Who dares touch a hair on my head?

00:11:15.039 --> 00:11:15.759
I guarantee...

00:11:15.879 --> 00:11:17.759
...Commander Liao will skin you alive.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:20.679
What do you mean?

00:11:20.799 --> 00:11:22.039
Commander Fan didn't defect.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.919
I was kidnapped by them.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.360
Who is this brat?

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.919
I am Commander Liao's son.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.080
I am Commander Liao's father.

00:11:44.039 --> 00:11:44.759
Release him.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.279
Commander Wei.

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:08.360
Sorry.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:09.840
Our Master...

00:12:09.919 --> 00:12:12.159
...just wants to have a happy birthday today.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.799
Only your boss has this honor.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.440
Commander Wei, this way please.

00:12:30.879 --> 00:12:31.879
Commander Wei

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.360
Let me introduce two friends to you

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.200
They're interested in some shops in your district

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.360
We are willing to pay the owner

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.639
double the price

00:12:40.039 --> 00:12:41.279
But that has nothing to do with me

00:12:41.919 --> 00:12:43.120
Commander Wei is definitely a partner

00:12:43.279 --> 00:12:44.000
Profits will be split evenly

00:12:45.279 --> 00:12:46.039
That settles it then

00:12:46.279 --> 00:12:47.120
If there are any issues

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.480
you talk to him

00:12:48.759 --> 00:12:49.120
Good, good, good

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.039
Excuse me for a moment

00:12:50.639 --> 00:12:51.080
Commander

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.279
Adjutant, about this matter

00:12:53.679 --> 00:12:54.399
Today

00:12:55.519 --> 00:12:57.600
I'm delighted to share a dance with you, Miss

00:12:58.039 --> 00:12:59.080
Me too

00:13:00.639 --> 00:13:02.240
It is truly the honor of a lifetime

00:13:06.879 --> 00:13:09.399
Division Commander Chen, you're in high spirits

00:13:10.639 --> 00:13:12.039
You still have the nerve to see me?

00:13:13.759 --> 00:13:15.840
I came specifically to pledge my loyalty to you

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.919
Beauty, don't block the way, move aside

00:13:18.559 --> 00:13:19.679
The two of us will dance

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.399
Division Commander Chen

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.240
I have investigated thoroughly

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.200
It was that old fox

00:13:27.399 --> 00:13:28.799
Liao Guanguan who was behind it

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.679
Why should I believe you?

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:32.919
What reason would I have to lie to you?

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.159
Think about it

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.440
With my handful of ragtag soldiers

00:13:36.879 --> 00:13:38.840
how could I possibly defeat Liao Guanguan?

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.759
I can only cling to your coattails

00:13:45.919 --> 00:13:47.600
to have a slim chance of survival

00:13:53.279 --> 00:13:54.440
What exactly must I do

00:13:55.159 --> 00:13:56.279
for you to believe me?

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:57.960
According to reliable sources

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.519
Liao Guanguan has a shipment of arms

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.159
that will pass through your defense line

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:03.840
You intercept it for me

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.159
Intercept the arms

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:12.480
And also

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.600
You can't make good use of Fan Pengju anyway

00:14:16.559 --> 00:14:18.759
You... hand him over to me

00:14:19.639 --> 00:14:20.320
Division Commander Chen

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.879
We have only just started our alliance

00:14:23.399 --> 00:14:24.840
and you're already poaching my men?

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.559
If you want to ally with me

00:14:27.679 --> 00:14:29.240
you have to show some sincerity

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.320
Your arrival

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.159
is the greatest gift to me.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.440
That your three divisions coexist peacefully

00:15:00.799 --> 00:15:02.240
allowing our common folk

00:15:03.039 --> 00:15:04.759
to live stable lives.

00:15:05.399 --> 00:15:06.039
Here,

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.039
on behalf of all the people in the city,

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.720
I thank you.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.600
Wishing you, sir,

00:15:13.879 --> 00:15:17.000
Boundless happiness and eternal longevity.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.120
Commander Wei

00:15:21.039 --> 00:15:23.440
ordered me to intercept Commander Liao's munitions.

00:15:25.159 --> 00:15:26.039
With this,

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.639
to make amends to Division Commander Chen

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.960
for my mistake of killing Commander Qin.

00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:37.039
Commander Liao is your old man.

00:15:37.919 --> 00:15:39.399
And we are sworn brothers.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.519
So that means

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.080
I have to go intercept

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.720
my brother's old man's munitions.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.799
Give me that eight-treasure oil cake.

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.399
It's intercepting your old man's munitions.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.039
Don't worry about me.

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.320
Grab a bit more.

00:16:05.759 --> 00:16:07.919
You shouldn't have revealed your identity.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:09.840
If I didn't reveal it,

00:16:10.519 --> 00:16:12.120
you would have eaten a bullet.

00:16:12.759 --> 00:16:14.600
But now you're in even more danger.

00:16:15.039 --> 00:16:17.120
They'll all use you to threaten Commander Liao.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.399
Let them threaten.

00:16:20.519 --> 00:16:22.200
They wouldn't dare do anything to me anyway.

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:23.200
Don't worry.

00:16:24.639 --> 00:16:25.720
I'll definitely find a way

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.799
to send you back to Commander Liao.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.440
I won't go back.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.240
I'd rather be locked up here.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.480
What's going on with you and your old man?

00:16:34.799 --> 00:16:36.039
What kind of deep hatred is there?

00:16:36.519 --> 00:16:38.039
Only family members

00:16:38.639 --> 00:16:40.600
won't harm you.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.960
Didn't you run away from home too?

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.080
If I told you to go back,

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.159
would you go back?

00:16:50.879 --> 00:16:52.240
Give me that fig.

00:16:52.919 --> 00:16:53.440
Okay.

00:17:01.919 --> 00:17:04.039
Our Weiyuan figs still taste the best.

00:17:09.519 --> 00:17:10.359
What is this?

00:17:10.559 --> 00:17:11.839
I made it for my son.

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:13.200
Your son?

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.559
Your sister-in-law Yuzhen

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:17.880
should be giving birth soon.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:19.960
But

00:17:20.759 --> 00:17:22.279
I haven't found her yet.

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:24.799
We are both fellow sufferers wandering the world.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.640
Luckily, although life outside is bitter,

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.039
it is free and unrestrained.

00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:30.400
Besides,

00:17:30.599 --> 00:17:31.440
our ambition

00:17:32.119 --> 00:17:33.400
isn't it to roam the world

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.559
and fight for justice?

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:41.359
When I get back, I'll send you home.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:42.960
I'm not going back.

00:17:43.039 --> 00:17:44.559
I won't go back with you.

00:17:44.759 --> 00:17:46.200
You're so annoying.

00:17:47.799 --> 00:17:48.640
It's this pier.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:49.960
Taking the water route.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.799
Commander Liao can only use this pier.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:53.680
But to return to his barracks,

00:17:53.839 --> 00:17:56.160
he must pass through Commander Wei's defense zone.

00:17:56.319 --> 00:17:57.079
I understand.

00:17:58.119 --> 00:17:59.359
Commander Liao's troops

00:17:59.359 --> 00:18:01.240
will be back within three days.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.400
Is the intelligence reliable?

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:04.880
Commander Fan,

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.400
I am the commander of the intelligence company, after all.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.680
I'm at least that certain.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:11.519
Hey, Company Commander,

00:18:12.279 --> 00:18:14.200
tell that guy Wei to get a few machine guns.

00:18:14.559 --> 00:18:15.519
As soon as they dock,

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.200
just sweep them and be done with it.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.119
Exactly, it'd be less trouble.

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:22.319
Since it's the only pier Commander Liao can use,

00:18:23.119 --> 00:18:24.920
there will surely be heavy troops receiving them.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.160
Once shots are fired,

00:18:26.799 --> 00:18:28.000
the main force will swarm over.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.119
When that happens,

00:18:29.759 --> 00:18:30.799
who will be sweeping whom?

00:18:32.119 --> 00:18:33.079
So many munitions,

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.279
we can't just carry them off.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.759
We can't carry them,

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.519
and Commander Liao's men can't carry them either.

00:18:39.799 --> 00:18:41.319
They definitely have transport trucks.

00:18:43.279 --> 00:18:44.440
So we'll intercept his trucks.

00:18:45.599 --> 00:18:46.839
That's a good idea.

00:18:49.519 --> 00:18:50.400
What are you doing here?

00:18:50.839 --> 00:18:52.039
The Commander ordered me to come help you.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.000
Sounds nice.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.279
I'm afraid Commander Wei sent you to monitor me.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.519
With that road as the boundary

00:19:07.799 --> 00:19:09.480
The southwest is Commander Wei's defense zone

00:19:09.799 --> 00:19:11.480
The northeast is Commander Liao's defense zone

00:19:12.119 --> 00:19:13.039
Commander Liao's convoy...

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.160
This is the only way through.

00:19:14.519 --> 00:19:15.640
Only this road is passable for vehicles.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.319
Dongshihui

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.079
Boss Fan

00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:22.160
Master

00:19:23.519 --> 00:19:25.400
Master, I missed you so much.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.279
I went inside to relieve myself,

00:19:27.279 --> 00:19:29.000
and found out the boss is your apprentice.

00:19:31.759 --> 00:19:32.400
Master.

00:19:32.759 --> 00:19:33.599
Let me introduce you.

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:35.160
These two are the bosses of

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.000
the other two Dongshihui branches in town.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:37.960
I specifically called the two of them

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:38.839
to come show off their skills.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:39.640
You can try it later

00:19:39.839 --> 00:19:41.039
and see if they've mastered the craft.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.440
Quick, pay your respects.

00:19:43.079 --> 00:19:45.119
Master, hello Grandmaster.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.640
Master, Grandmaster, hello Great-Grandmaster.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.119
Not bad, not bad.

00:19:50.279 --> 00:19:51.799
I'm already a Great-Grandmaster.

00:19:53.839 --> 00:19:54.680
You two go get busy.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:55.759
Go on now.

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.279
This location is not bad.

00:20:00.559 --> 00:20:01.279
Master.

00:20:01.599 --> 00:20:03.119
It's all thanks to you.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.480
Usually around here,

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.839
what kind of customers do you serve?

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.359
We are quite close to the pier,

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.880
so usually it's mostly dock workers.

00:20:12.039 --> 00:20:13.119
The passing soldiers,

00:20:13.119 --> 00:20:14.240
do they give you trouble?

00:20:14.319 --> 00:20:15.160
No, no, no.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.200
They are all regular customers here.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.799
Usually when they have a mission,

00:20:19.119 --> 00:20:20.440
they always eat two meals here.

00:20:21.039 --> 00:20:22.240
Once when heading out,

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.720
and once when coming back.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.480
A soldier came to book a table today.

00:20:26.799 --> 00:20:27.519
It seems he said

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.759
a troop is returning in the next couple of days.

00:20:30.759 --> 00:20:31.200
Apprentice.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.839
Doing business isn't easy.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.119
However much we eat today,

00:20:35.279 --> 00:20:36.480
I will pay for it all.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:37.960
Master.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.039
Why are you saying this to me?

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.359
However many days you stay here,

00:20:43.079 --> 00:20:44.799
I'll treat you to that many meals.

00:20:45.759 --> 00:20:46.599
To tell you the truth,

00:20:47.759 --> 00:20:49.519
I'm on a mission this time.

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.519
I need you to do us a favor.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.000
This Sichuan pepper is very important.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.559
Too much will numb the mouth,

00:20:59.559 --> 00:21:00.759
too little and it won't be fragrant.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:01.960
Move aside, let me do it.

00:21:02.279 --> 00:21:03.000
Come on, Master.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:07.640
Look, look.

00:21:09.039 --> 00:21:11.000
Although it's spicy hot pot,

00:21:11.319 --> 00:21:13.759
fermented rice wine is very important.

00:21:15.799 --> 00:21:17.559
How have you forgotten everything I taught you?

00:21:18.279 --> 00:21:20.960
Why are you teaching skills at a time like this?

00:21:21.599 --> 00:21:22.880
When do we add this?

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:24.400
Add it now.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:25.279
How much?

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:26.680
Pour it all in.

00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:27.599
Alright.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.640
Master, is this your secret recipe?

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:34.720
With this added,

00:21:34.799 --> 00:21:36.000
how is the taste different?

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.799
Lao San, have a taste.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:41.400
Okay.

00:21:48.079 --> 00:21:48.759
Can't taste the difference.

00:21:54.759 --> 00:21:56.279
Seems okay.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.079
You two idiots, what kind of tongues do you have?

00:21:59.279 --> 00:21:59.839
Let me try.

00:22:04.599 --> 00:22:05.599
It's great.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.680
See? See?

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.079
None of you three tasted anything strange.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.400
Those soldiers,

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.720
how could they possibly taste it?

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.119
That's right.

00:22:22.519 --> 00:22:23.079
Master.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.400
What... what did you put in there?

00:22:24.519 --> 00:22:25.599
If the soldiers eat this,

00:22:25.759 --> 00:22:27.400
I won't be able to escape the blame, Master.

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.000
I dare not, I dare not.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:29.920
I can't do this.

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.359
I... I really dare not.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:33.880
Don't panic.

00:22:36.039 --> 00:22:37.240
Let me think again.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.599
I'll go report to Commander Fan.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.000
The Company Commander is awake! He's awake!

00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:58.960
We're here, right?

00:23:02.799 --> 00:23:04.240
R-Reporting, Sir.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.640
Everything is ready.

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:07.319
Good.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.240
What's wrong with you today?

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.079
N-Nothing.

00:23:13.279 --> 00:23:14.759
Hurry up! Hurry up! Assemble!

00:23:15.799 --> 00:23:17.000
Second Squad, stand guard.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:17.960
Yes, Sir!

00:23:19.279 --> 00:23:20.319
Let's go together.

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.480
If you want the horse to run...

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:24.920
...it has to eat grass.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.039
The stuff on that truck...

00:23:28.279 --> 00:23:29.720
...is more important than our heads.

00:23:31.599 --> 00:23:32.880
Please, please.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.359
Why did you close the door?

00:23:50.799 --> 00:23:51.799
You are honored guests.

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.240
No idlers allowed to disturb you.

00:23:58.279 --> 00:23:59.000
What are you doing?

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.000
Sir.

00:24:01.359 --> 00:24:03.400
I see you frequent this shop often.

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:04.599
We serve hotpot too.

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.960
Why don't you come eat at our place?

00:24:06.119 --> 00:24:07.000
And which place are you?

00:24:07.359 --> 00:24:09.119
Also called Dongshihui.

00:24:09.319 --> 00:24:11.640
We're cleaning customers' ears for free today.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.960
Come, let us help you relax, Sir.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:14.839
All right.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:22.839
Why is everyone dozing off?

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:23.680
Drank too much.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.559
You must really be drunk.

00:24:25.759 --> 00:24:26.680
The wine hasn't even been opened.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:49.680
Oh no.

00:26:03.039 --> 00:26:03.599
I knew it.

00:26:03.839 --> 00:26:05.359
With me here, it's in safe hands.

00:26:05.759 --> 00:26:06.240
Master.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.039
Is it done? Is it done?

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.440
Master owes you for this one.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.640
Children of the Jianghu never back down.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.079
You won't be able to get off the hook now.

00:26:17.319 --> 00:26:19.039
I've wanted to open a shop in Chengdu for a long time.

00:26:19.599 --> 00:26:20.519
It's just that the date...

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:21.440
...has been moved up a bit.

00:26:21.839 --> 00:26:22.640
This livelihood of mine...

00:26:22.839 --> 00:26:23.839
...was all given to me by you, Master.

00:26:24.079 --> 00:26:24.599
Don't mention it.

00:26:25.359 --> 00:26:26.000
Don't mention it.

00:26:27.119 --> 00:26:29.920
And thank you, heroines, for your help.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:33.599
Take it out.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:34.720
What?

00:26:41.319 --> 00:26:42.680
Master will remember this.

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:44.160
We'll meet again.

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:50.400
Take care.

00:26:50.519 --> 00:26:51.839
Okay. Come on, let's go.

00:26:52.599 --> 00:26:53.319
Take care. Take care.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.319
Oh, right. Right. Right.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:05.720
Hurry up, hurry up.

00:27:07.599 --> 00:27:09.279
Wasn't half of this supposed to be Division Commander Chen's?

00:27:09.519 --> 00:27:10.759
Why is it all going into storage?

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:11.839
Commander Fan, stay out of this.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:12.759
Brother Fan.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.240
You're finally back.

00:27:14.559 --> 00:27:15.319
The Little Boss, he...

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:15.960
What happened?

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.279
Commander Wei sent him to Division Commander Chen.

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:19.680
What?

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.920
Darn it.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.599
Why did you take Commander Liao's son...

00:27:25.599 --> 00:27:26.680
...and send him to Division Commander Chen?

00:27:27.079 --> 00:27:29.039
He is just a burning hot potato.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.680
If I didn't send him away,

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.480
should I let Liao Guanguan come hassle me?

00:27:33.119 --> 00:27:34.200
You could have just...

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.559
...returned him to Commander Liao.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.039
Tie the guy up,

00:27:38.519 --> 00:27:39.759
and then send him back?

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.119
Now he's in Cousin Chen's hands.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.799
Let the two of them fight it out.

00:27:44.279 --> 00:27:46.039
You think Division Commander Chen can't see...

00:27:46.039 --> 00:27:47.079
...what you're planning?

00:27:47.359 --> 00:27:48.599
What does that have to do with me?

00:27:50.279 --> 00:27:51.720
He got Liao Guanguan's son.

00:27:52.039 --> 00:27:53.759
I got Liao Guanguan's munitions.

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.680
It's very fair.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.039
You're swallowing the munitions too?

00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.839
Commander, you can't do this.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.319
If Division Commander Chen finds out,

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.519
he might return the kid to Commander Liao in a rage,

00:28:03.519 --> 00:28:04.920
and then the two of them could join forces...

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:05.519
...against us,

00:28:05.599 --> 00:28:07.079
then we're in trouble.

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:07.960
Impossible.

00:28:08.319 --> 00:28:10.079
Knowing Cousin Chen as I do,

00:28:10.519 --> 00:28:12.440
he wouldn't go sucking up to anyone.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:13.839
Commander...

00:28:14.079 --> 00:28:15.839
...we must be cautious about this.

00:28:16.039 --> 00:28:17.039
He's already been sent away.

00:28:17.039 --> 00:28:18.680
What's the use of talking all this crap?

00:28:18.799 --> 00:28:19.799
Just a little kid.

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.000
Nothing but a bargaining chip.

00:28:24.599 --> 00:28:25.240
You...

00:28:25.799 --> 00:28:27.440
...have been using me all along.

00:28:28.319 --> 00:28:29.640
You said you were saving me,

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.480
but your goal was just to expand your own troops.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.599
Making me and my brothers cannon fodder.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.680
Imprisoning Xiugu.

00:28:38.279 --> 00:28:39.720
Trading a child.

00:28:40.279 --> 00:28:42.680
Destroying your alliance with Division Commander Chen.

00:28:43.279 --> 00:28:45.039
You disloyal, unfilial...

00:28:45.039 --> 00:28:47.160
...heartless, unjust son of a bitch!

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.720
I was completely blind...

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.799
...to become sworn brothers with you.

00:28:53.039 --> 00:28:55.319
You have sores on your head...

00:28:55.319 --> 00:28:57.559
...and pus oozing from your feet, you scumbag.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:58.599
Asshole.

00:29:02.079 --> 00:29:03.400
Just a little kid.

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:04.839
Nothing but a bargaining chip.

00:29:05.599 --> 00:29:07.720
To win, you'll do whatever it takes?

00:29:08.079 --> 00:29:10.200
To win, one can do whatever it takes.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:11.640
Yes.

00:29:12.359 --> 00:29:13.160
To win,

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:15.480
one can indeed do whatever it takes.

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.680
Drink up.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:21.319
Bottoms up.

00:29:21.799 --> 00:29:22.920
Coming, coming.

00:29:24.759 --> 00:29:25.720
We're different now.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.319
Before, stealing some grain...

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:28.880
...felt like we did something huge.

00:29:29.319 --> 00:29:30.480
What are we stealing now?

00:29:31.359 --> 00:29:32.079
Munitions.

00:29:33.799 --> 00:29:34.480
Exactly. Sister-in-law,

00:29:34.599 --> 00:29:35.319
you didn't see it.

00:29:35.559 --> 00:29:36.559
That stuff was scary.

00:29:37.599 --> 00:29:38.759
A toast to Sister-in-law.

00:29:39.279 --> 00:29:40.559
Every time we come back from a mission,

00:29:40.559 --> 00:29:41.920
Sister-in-law makes us good food.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.319
Sister-in-law, thank you for your hard work.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:45.480
To Sister-in-law.

00:29:49.799 --> 00:29:51.599
Don't be shy, we're all family.

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.279
I'll go make you some more food.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:54.440
Okay, okay.

00:30:05.519 --> 00:30:06.240
Brothers,

00:30:07.079 --> 00:30:08.000
I have decided

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.279
to leave Commander Wei.

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:14.599
We should have left long ago.

00:30:15.319 --> 00:30:16.319
I'm with you.

00:30:17.079 --> 00:30:17.920
But with so many of us,

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:18.519
where can we go?

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.200
Worst case, we go back to the mountains.

00:30:29.119 --> 00:30:30.720
Don't be too rash.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.799
Commander Wei has his issues,

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.039
but at least he

00:30:34.039 --> 00:30:35.440
made you a regular army.

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:39.160
He is not a man I can follow.

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:40.519
You...

00:30:41.319 --> 00:30:42.279
are you coming with me or not?

00:30:42.599 --> 00:30:43.559
Decide for yourself.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.119
We did so much for Commander Wei.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:47.319
Leaving just like this...

00:30:47.519 --> 00:30:48.599
lets him off too easy.

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:49.799
If you ask me,

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:51.440
we might as well steal the munitions.

00:30:54.759 --> 00:30:56.400
You son of a bitch, that's a great idea.

00:30:58.079 --> 00:30:59.599
Those munitions should belong to us anyway.

00:31:00.319 --> 00:31:02.160
Right. We want to set up on our own,

00:31:02.319 --> 00:31:03.920
we need guns in our hands.

00:31:06.079 --> 00:31:07.640
After we steal the munitions,

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.240
we'll go find Division Commander Chen.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:11.680
Why?

00:31:11.799 --> 00:31:13.119
To save Little Boss.

00:31:14.279 --> 00:31:15.359
My brother,

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.920
that is Commander Liao's son.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.319
We can write him a letter.

00:31:18.319 --> 00:31:19.519
He will go himself.

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.160
No need for us to get involved.

00:31:21.799 --> 00:31:23.039
No matter whose son he is,

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:24.519
he is my brother.

00:31:24.799 --> 00:31:26.440
Just like everyone here.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.599
No matter who is in trouble,

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:31.359
I won't give up on anyone.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.799
To Big Brother!

00:31:34.359 --> 00:31:35.559
Come on, come on!

00:31:42.319 --> 00:31:42.920
Big Brother,

00:31:43.759 --> 00:31:45.000
there's one more important thing.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.880
Ma Laohu hasn't been avenged yet.

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:50.960
Big Brother,

00:31:51.359 --> 00:31:52.759
you promised her.

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.279
You have to avenge her.

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:57.720
Commander Fan.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.279
Don't you worry about that.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.359
I will handle it myself.

00:32:20.039 --> 00:32:21.359
Keep him safe.

00:32:23.279 --> 00:32:24.119
Do you hear me?

00:32:42.519 --> 00:32:43.880
You won't go snitch, will you?
