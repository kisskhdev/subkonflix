00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.089
EPISODE 10

00:01:13.804 --> 00:01:16.015
Recalculating route.

00:01:16.098 --> 00:01:17.933
Hey. Hey!

00:01:18.684 --> 00:01:20.102
Darn it.

00:01:20.686 --> 00:01:24.899
Where on earth does Bom live
that even the GPS is confused?

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.871
44-5 HAEEUN-GIL, SHINSU-EUP, JUAN-GUN

00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:43.751
Is it that one?

00:02:04.855 --> 00:02:05.689
What on earth?

00:02:06.357 --> 00:02:07.816
It's so slow.

00:02:12.363 --> 00:02:13.697
Gosh.

00:02:16.742 --> 00:02:19.495
Why is it going so slow?

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:21.580
This will take forever.

00:02:33.926 --> 00:02:35.970
All right.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.473
Shall we get up?

00:02:43.852 --> 00:02:45.646
Oh, no. What do I do?

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.080
This is bad.

00:03:07.084 --> 00:03:10.421
That darn brat Yoon Bom!
She'll be the end of me!

00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:15.592
God, please help me.

00:03:16.635 --> 00:03:17.928
If you let me live,

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:22.099
I will forgive my daughter and my haters.

00:03:22.683 --> 00:03:24.643
If you're too busy to come save me,

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.773
please send someone reliable
in your stead.

00:03:59.053 --> 00:04:01.847
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

00:04:06.935 --> 00:04:10.814
What is your name?

00:04:19.198 --> 00:04:20.949
Goodness.

00:04:28.457 --> 00:04:30.834
Thank you so much for saving me.

00:04:32.753 --> 00:04:34.004
By the way,

00:04:34.755 --> 00:04:38.217
I'm asking just in case.
Do you know who I…

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.804
You're actress Jeong Nan-hee.
What brought you to the countryside?

00:04:41.887 --> 00:04:43.097
Oh, my.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.891
So you knew.
I thought you might not recognize me.

00:04:47.601 --> 00:04:49.103
My high school friend…

00:04:51.146 --> 00:04:53.023
Someone I knew was a huge fan of yours.

00:04:54.191 --> 00:04:57.402
We were together all the time,
so I watched your movies a lot.

00:04:57.486 --> 00:05:00.447
I thought it'd make you uncomfortable
if I recognized you.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:02.366
That's why.

00:05:04.743 --> 00:05:07.788
You're incredibly strong,
not to mention incredibly thoughtful.

00:05:07.871 --> 00:05:09.206
Please.

00:05:09.873 --> 00:05:14.086
You see, I came here to find someone.

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:16.755
I don't think you can.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.301
The suspension is broken.

00:05:22.636 --> 00:05:24.263
My, my.

00:05:25.806 --> 00:05:26.932
Put these on.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.644
As soon as the car's fixed,
they'll call you.

00:05:30.727 --> 00:05:32.271
Please, come in.

00:05:33.105 --> 00:05:36.066
I'm not sure
if I should inconvenience you like this.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.028
You see, rumors spread faster in Shinsu
than they do on the Internet.

00:05:40.112 --> 00:05:43.282
Besides, you're a celebrity.
Where would you go?

00:05:44.283 --> 00:05:46.660
-Then I'll accept the offer.
-Sure.

00:05:52.583 --> 00:05:54.543
FILIAL PIETY AWARD

00:05:57.921 --> 00:06:00.299
Who are you really?

00:06:00.382 --> 00:06:05.387
You're strong and thoughtful.
And you've raised your son really well.

00:06:07.681 --> 00:06:10.392
Han-gyul's received so many awards
since he was little,

00:06:10.475 --> 00:06:12.769
I use small awards
as trivets for hot bowls,

00:06:12.853 --> 00:06:17.274
and silver medals to prop up
wobbly dressers. You know?

00:06:23.822 --> 00:06:25.199
I guess you haven't eaten.

00:06:25.908 --> 00:06:26.742
Right.

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:29.786
I have some gaengsigi porridge.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.374
Do you want some jeongguji pancakes
with a side of jaeraegi?

00:06:34.458 --> 00:06:36.668
That's so rhythmic.

00:06:37.377 --> 00:06:39.880
I didn't understand any of that.

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:44.301
But the way you say it is so poetic.

00:06:58.065 --> 00:06:59.107
Hello?

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.527
You got home safe, right?

00:07:03.195 --> 00:07:06.156
I was wondering
what time you'll come for Bom-sik.

00:07:07.532 --> 00:07:09.826
I'm sorry, but I have a guest at home.

00:07:16.041 --> 00:07:17.334
I understand.

00:07:18.001 --> 00:07:20.671
Then I'll stop by after school.

00:07:20.754 --> 00:07:23.548
It's delicious.
What's the secret behind the flavor?

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.260
Who is that?

00:07:27.094 --> 00:07:28.553
It was a woman's voice.

00:07:34.351 --> 00:07:37.229
Can you recommend things to do
on a first date?

00:07:37.312 --> 00:07:40.649
Wow, a first date. That's so exciting.

00:07:40.732 --> 00:07:45.070
How about doing something casual
like going to the movies?

00:07:46.947 --> 00:07:49.616
Want to go to the movies?
Is there anything you want to watch?

00:07:50.284 --> 00:07:51.118
The movies?

00:07:54.454 --> 00:07:57.791
What does it mean if a man asks
to go to the movies on a first date?

00:07:57.874 --> 00:07:59.835
Asking you to go to the movies

00:07:59.918 --> 00:08:02.462
may sound like something casual,

00:08:02.546 --> 00:08:05.382
but he could have other intentions.

00:08:05.465 --> 00:08:09.720
For instance, using the dark theater
as an excuse for physical contact.

00:08:11.555 --> 00:08:12.597
Physical contact?

00:08:13.223 --> 00:08:14.933
How about A Killer's Dinner?

00:08:15.517 --> 00:08:17.060
A Killer's Dinner?

00:08:19.229 --> 00:08:20.772
She wants to watch a horror movie.

00:08:21.732 --> 00:08:23.692
Wow, that's a good sign.

00:08:23.775 --> 00:08:26.528
If she wants to watch a horror movie,
it might mean

00:08:26.611 --> 00:08:30.073
she wants to see
if you're reliable and considerate

00:08:30.157 --> 00:08:32.284
-in a scary situation.
-Considerate?

00:08:33.452 --> 00:08:34.453
Reliable?

00:08:37.706 --> 00:08:40.208
I'll buy the tickets. You just come.

00:08:40.292 --> 00:08:41.543
"You just come"?

00:08:43.086 --> 00:08:45.422
He sounds so enthusiastic.

00:08:46.423 --> 00:08:49.343
What's he thinking of doing
on a first date?

00:09:06.401 --> 00:09:07.819
What are you listening to?

00:09:07.903 --> 00:09:09.529
Oh, nothing.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.329
What? Did the guest leave?

00:09:18.205 --> 00:09:19.289
The gate is open.

00:09:21.875 --> 00:09:24.878
Mr. Sun. Mr. Sun Jae-gyu.

00:09:27.005 --> 00:09:27.964
Let's go.

00:09:37.682 --> 00:09:40.394
Bom-sik, how about we surprise Daddy?

00:09:46.691 --> 00:09:47.776
Jae-gyu!

00:09:47.859 --> 00:09:49.069
Oh, my!

00:09:50.112 --> 00:09:51.071
Oh, my!

00:09:52.948 --> 00:09:54.116
Mom.

00:09:55.742 --> 00:09:57.994
What's going on?
Why are you in this house?

00:09:58.578 --> 00:10:01.289
That's what I should ask you.
Why are you here, Mom?

00:10:03.333 --> 00:10:04.543
Hold on.

00:10:04.626 --> 00:10:07.087
Is that man the one you're seeing?

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:08.713
Did you hire a PI or something?

00:10:08.797 --> 00:10:12.217
How on earth did you know
who I'm seeing and where he lives?

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.177
God, you're such a terrible daughter.

00:10:14.261 --> 00:10:17.389
You may hate me,
but I came all the way here to see you.

00:10:17.472 --> 00:10:19.474
Shouldn't you hold back your anger?

00:10:22.394 --> 00:10:24.104
I held back and buried it,

00:10:24.896 --> 00:10:26.106
like you told me to.

00:10:27.858 --> 00:10:32.028
Since actress Jeong Nan-hee's life
is greater than a teacher's life.

00:10:32.779 --> 00:10:36.950
As a lowly daughter, I didn't want to harm
your perfect career as an actress,

00:10:38.118 --> 00:10:41.413
so I did as you said,
knowing it would ruin my life.

00:10:43.123 --> 00:10:47.377
And by doing that, I believe I did
more than enough as a daughter.

00:10:48.128 --> 00:10:51.173
So, please,
let's live our own lives from now on.

00:10:56.636 --> 00:10:58.263
This is for the ticket I asked for.

00:10:58.847 --> 00:11:00.599
Thank you for your help.

00:11:02.434 --> 00:11:04.561
Ms. Jeong Nan-hee.

00:11:05.145 --> 00:11:06.813
My goodness.

00:11:06.897 --> 00:11:09.858
I guess I missed a fun sight
while checking on the car.

00:11:09.941 --> 00:11:12.486
I see that you two already met.

00:11:14.154 --> 00:11:16.072
The bill's settled, so please leave.

00:11:16.156 --> 00:11:18.450
My own daughter's worse than the haters.

00:11:19.034 --> 00:11:20.452
Saying that to your mom.

00:11:21.036 --> 00:11:22.162
"Mom"?

00:11:24.247 --> 00:11:25.582
"Mom"?

00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:31.421
So are you saying your daughter...

00:11:32.714 --> 00:11:35.091
is Ms. Bom? Is that it?

00:11:36.218 --> 00:11:37.802
Oh, my goodness.

00:11:37.886 --> 00:11:41.139
I had no idea. I just helped you
because your car broke down.

00:11:42.516 --> 00:11:43.892
Let me greet you properly.

00:11:44.643 --> 00:11:45.852
I'm Sun Jae-gyu.

00:11:51.274 --> 00:11:55.153
How could you meet a guy like this
in a nowhere town?

00:11:56.363 --> 00:11:57.322
Ms. Jeong.

00:11:57.405 --> 00:12:00.408
Just earlier, you called me your hero,

00:12:00.492 --> 00:12:02.160
saying I was a hidden gem

00:12:02.744 --> 00:12:06.706
who was well-built, thoughtful,
and poetic in the way I spoke.

00:12:07.832 --> 00:12:11.086
That was when you were just a stranger.

00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:17.175
Could you tell me
what you don't like about me specifically?

00:12:18.051 --> 00:12:19.636
First of all, you have a kid.

00:12:20.303 --> 00:12:21.429
He's my nephew.

00:12:22.305 --> 00:12:24.266
You're more dad-like than most.

00:12:25.225 --> 00:12:27.435
Plus, your muscles are too big.

00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:28.728
I'll lose some of them.

00:12:28.812 --> 00:12:30.689
And I can't understand your dialect.

00:12:31.731 --> 00:12:33.608
My mother was from Seoul, so…

00:12:34.818 --> 00:12:37.070
Hello. I'm Sun Jae-gyu.

00:12:40.824 --> 00:12:43.034
I can speak
in a Seoul accent if I want to.

00:12:43.118 --> 00:12:45.370
In any case, I don't like your face.

00:12:45.453 --> 00:12:47.622
Your outfit and hairstyle too.

00:12:49.416 --> 00:12:50.750
I told you to leave.

00:12:50.834 --> 00:12:52.127
Ms. Bom.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:53.461
I'm going.

00:12:54.754 --> 00:12:56.047
Geez.

00:12:59.342 --> 00:13:02.304
Now I've paid you for the food
and for letting me sleep here,

00:13:02.387 --> 00:13:05.265
so no malicious comments online. Okay?

00:13:08.602 --> 00:13:10.562
Ms. Jeong.

00:13:10.645 --> 00:13:12.397
How can I take this?

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.732
If you follow her out,

00:13:14.899 --> 00:13:16.484
we're through.

00:13:17.902 --> 00:13:19.070
But…

00:13:36.504 --> 00:13:38.715
Still, how could you come to my office?

00:13:38.798 --> 00:13:41.593
What if Ms. Bom finds out
about you and me?

00:13:41.676 --> 00:13:44.429
Since it's come to this, I don't care.

00:13:45.722 --> 00:13:47.015
What about me?

00:13:47.098 --> 00:13:51.227
What if she finds out
that I've been in touch with you?

00:13:52.145 --> 00:13:53.647
She'll be furious.

00:13:54.356 --> 00:13:57.192
She made a fuss,
asking who told me where she lives.

00:13:59.569 --> 00:14:00.612
You should leave.

00:14:01.363 --> 00:14:03.907
If she sees us here like this,
she'll only get more hurt.

00:14:05.116 --> 00:14:06.701
Don't you see how I'm hurt?

00:14:07.369 --> 00:14:10.830
You're the president
of The Chronicles of Nan-hee, my fancafe,

00:14:10.914 --> 00:14:12.999
not Yoon Bom's.

00:14:14.834 --> 00:14:16.795
Don't worry about anything else,

00:14:16.878 --> 00:14:19.297
and tell me who he is and what he does.

00:14:19.381 --> 00:14:20.757
In every detail.

00:14:25.428 --> 00:14:26.763
He's your archenemy.

00:14:27.389 --> 00:14:29.474
You said he ran off with your money.

00:14:29.557 --> 00:14:32.227
Just what happened between you two?

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:46.950
What happened?

00:14:47.784 --> 00:14:48.785
Did he beat you again?

00:14:51.538 --> 00:14:54.332
If I stayed home,
one of two things would happen, so I left.

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:59.713
Either he'd end up killing me…

00:15:02.799 --> 00:15:04.926
or I'd end up killing him.

00:15:08.179 --> 00:15:09.514
That would never happen.

00:15:11.349 --> 00:15:12.183
Because…

00:15:14.227 --> 00:15:16.396
I'll help you escape from your father.

00:15:23.278 --> 00:15:24.988
And how will you do that?

00:15:28.158 --> 00:15:30.618
I haven't heard from my sister,

00:15:31.244 --> 00:15:33.455
and Han-gyul can't even walk yet.

00:15:33.538 --> 00:15:35.874
And I have no money
even if I did want to run away.

00:15:49.721 --> 00:15:50.638
You…

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:53.516
Did you steal it?

00:15:56.352 --> 00:15:58.521
Where did you get so much money?

00:15:59.397 --> 00:16:00.273
Honey.

00:16:00.356 --> 00:16:02.525
He came in first on every midterm exam.

00:16:02.609 --> 00:16:03.943
Look. Here.

00:16:04.027 --> 00:16:05.028
-Here.
-Really?

00:16:06.112 --> 00:16:07.030
Dad.

00:16:07.781 --> 00:16:10.700
You promised to buy me a car
if I got into Hanguk University.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:14.329
With these grades, I'm sure I'll get in.

00:16:14.412 --> 00:16:15.455
Can I get the money

00:16:17.415 --> 00:16:18.708
for the car in advance?

00:16:24.339 --> 00:16:25.340
Answer my question.

00:16:26.674 --> 00:16:28.301
Where did you get so much money?

00:16:29.844 --> 00:16:30.678
Buddy.

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:34.432
I earned this fair and square,
so don't worry,

00:16:35.391 --> 00:16:37.018
and study hard.

00:16:38.603 --> 00:16:41.731
This is enough for your tuition.

00:16:46.361 --> 00:16:49.614
Are you telling me to go to college?

00:16:51.324 --> 00:16:54.661
If we go to college in Seoul,
we can do whatever we want.

00:16:56.788 --> 00:16:58.957
I can escape from my father...

00:17:01.584 --> 00:17:03.545
and you from yours.

00:17:14.013 --> 00:17:17.016
This is terrible.
I hear Jae-gyu's house is on fire.

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:20.311
There are fire trucks and police cars.
It's total chaos.

00:17:27.151 --> 00:17:30.196
Oh, no. It looks like
the father didn't make it.

00:17:35.535 --> 00:17:37.704
What about Jae-gyu?

00:17:38.663 --> 00:17:40.456
What about Sun Jae-gyu, the son?

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.750
-He must've run off.
-Watch what you say.

00:17:42.834 --> 00:17:44.544
You don't know what happened.

00:17:44.627 --> 00:17:49.924
The father comes home wasted every day
and beats the son up.

00:17:50.008 --> 00:17:52.510
So how can he be in his right mind?

00:17:52.594 --> 00:17:53.845
I wouldn't put up with it.

00:17:53.928 --> 00:17:56.890
Are you saying the son ran off
after setting the house on fire?

00:17:59.017 --> 00:18:02.103
You're a Haechon High student, right?
Do you know Sun Jae-gyu?

00:18:06.232 --> 00:18:07.191
Hey!

00:18:09.527 --> 00:18:12.113
Hey!

00:18:33.134 --> 00:18:36.346
What is it? What happened between you two?

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:43.186
Go.

00:18:43.269 --> 00:18:47.690
I'm sure you're rich enough to call a cab
or even a chopper to go home.

00:18:50.026 --> 00:18:51.152
I won't.

00:18:51.235 --> 00:18:52.612
Why not?

00:18:52.695 --> 00:18:54.614
If you won't tell me,
I'll find out myself.

00:18:55.198 --> 00:18:56.741
I cleared my schedule anyway.

00:18:56.824 --> 00:19:01.079
While I'm here, I'll find out what kind
of person that Sun Jae-gyu guy really is.

00:19:07.627 --> 00:19:11.047
Listen. It's true
that I approached you on purpose,

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:13.633
but I wasn't lying about how I felt.

00:19:13.716 --> 00:19:16.427
When I'm with you,
I have fun and feel happy and…

00:19:18.972 --> 00:19:20.515
I get butterflies.

00:19:20.598 --> 00:19:22.809
You're disturbing my workout. Leave.

00:19:22.892 --> 00:19:27.063
I mean, if I didn't, why would I spend
my time and money meeting you?

00:19:27.146 --> 00:19:30.191
We were both lonely,
so let's say we made a mistake

00:19:30.274 --> 00:19:31.484
and part ways now.

00:19:32.151 --> 00:19:33.778
Master, what do I do next?

00:19:33.861 --> 00:19:35.613
Dump him. No, I mean...

00:19:35.697 --> 00:19:37.782
We'll do a technical stand up.

00:19:44.622 --> 00:19:47.041
Hye-suk, I don't want to part ways.

00:19:47.959 --> 00:19:50.503
I know we didn't get off to a good start,

00:19:51.087 --> 00:19:54.173
but we can build a good relationship
since we rely on each other.

00:19:54.257 --> 00:19:55.466
Do that with me.

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:58.052
Pardon? Do what?

00:19:58.136 --> 00:19:59.637
Build a good relationship.

00:19:59.721 --> 00:20:02.265
There's no one waiting
for me at home either.

00:20:02.348 --> 00:20:04.017
I'm bored, so this is nice.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.561
On weekends, let's go to an amusement park

00:20:06.644 --> 00:20:07.854
and go to the movies.

00:20:07.937 --> 00:20:10.940
What… Why would I go
to the movies with you?

00:20:11.024 --> 00:20:12.191
If you don't like that,

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.902
-how about my place?
-Your place?

00:20:14.986 --> 00:20:16.821
How about tonight? Want to come over

00:20:18.197 --> 00:20:19.323
and have ramyeon with me?

00:20:19.907 --> 00:20:20.950
No. Gosh.

00:20:21.743 --> 00:20:25.496
Well, I'm intermittent fasting right now.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.540
Well, then. Goodbye.

00:20:39.177 --> 00:20:40.386
Why are you following me?

00:20:41.304 --> 00:20:43.139
I'm just walking you home.

00:20:43.765 --> 00:20:45.016
Why would you?

00:20:46.768 --> 00:20:49.771
Because I'm worried
that jerk might bother you again.

00:20:51.773 --> 00:20:54.358
Do you have feelings for me?

00:20:55.526 --> 00:20:56.527
What do you mean?

00:20:57.236 --> 00:20:59.072
Let me make it clear.

00:20:59.572 --> 00:21:01.699
There won't be any more men in my life.

00:21:02.283 --> 00:21:04.577
I've learned my lesson.

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:08.498
I'm no longer interested in men,
and I've lost my confidence.

00:21:08.581 --> 00:21:10.291
Do you think I'm confident?

00:21:12.126 --> 00:21:15.671
You're two years older than me,
you're divorced, and you have kids.

00:21:15.755 --> 00:21:18.174
I mean, there's nothing I like about you.

00:21:18.257 --> 00:21:21.344
Exactly! You just pointed out
my flaws one by one.

00:21:21.427 --> 00:21:23.179
I wouldn't like me if I were you.

00:21:23.262 --> 00:21:25.264
Now I know you're not interested.

00:21:25.348 --> 00:21:28.059
But I can't help it. I'll give it a shot.

00:21:29.393 --> 00:21:31.979
Are you mocking me or saying you like me?

00:21:34.899 --> 00:21:35.983
Look.

00:21:36.067 --> 00:21:39.403
I don't date a woman
without marriage in mind.

00:21:40.279 --> 00:21:41.239
Marriage?

00:21:41.322 --> 00:21:43.407
I don't know
if I can overcome the obstacles.

00:21:44.075 --> 00:21:46.661
But I've become drawn to you
while bickering with you.

00:21:47.578 --> 00:21:50.081
I don't know if the twins will grow on me.

00:21:50.164 --> 00:21:53.543
I'll buy them meals and play soccer
with them. I want to try my best!

00:21:57.505 --> 00:22:01.717
If it still doesn't work,
I'll give up on my own.

00:22:03.553 --> 00:22:05.304
So don't worry.

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:08.432
I'll confess my feeling for you then.

00:22:15.439 --> 00:22:16.816
Come on, let's go.

00:22:47.722 --> 00:22:48.598
Why are you…

00:23:03.196 --> 00:23:04.155
The dream…

00:23:08.284 --> 00:23:09.410
is back.

00:23:33.809 --> 00:23:37.688
You mentioned
a colleague of your colleague

00:23:37.772 --> 00:23:39.690
who got assaulted by a parent.

00:23:41.359 --> 00:23:45.238
I put together the legal briefs
and court rulings from cases I worked on.

00:23:56.707 --> 00:23:58.042
COURT RULINGS ON TEACHER ASSAULT

00:23:59.752 --> 00:24:02.004
Is it because I recalled it after a while

00:24:03.422 --> 00:24:04.382
or…

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.052
because I saw my mom?

00:24:14.183 --> 00:24:15.268
Yes, Mr. Sun.

00:24:23.734 --> 00:24:26.237
How many dishes did you order?

00:24:28.281 --> 00:24:29.824
This is pork cutlet with demi-glace.

00:24:29.907 --> 00:24:32.034
And this is katsudon.

00:24:32.118 --> 00:24:35.162
Pork cutlets are roughly
categorized into two types.

00:24:35.746 --> 00:24:37.957
Thick ones with meat as a main ingredient.

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:40.626
And thin ones focusing on crispiness.

00:24:41.627 --> 00:24:43.379
Which type do you prefer?

00:24:43.462 --> 00:24:44.880
Crispy ones, of course.

00:24:45.464 --> 00:24:46.590
Okay.

00:25:01.647 --> 00:25:03.649
As expected, crispy ones are so good.

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:10.823
Gosh, it's so thick and juicy, isn't it?

00:25:13.117 --> 00:25:14.160
By any chance,

00:25:15.703 --> 00:25:20.249
did what my mom said yesterday
hurt your feelings?

00:25:22.335 --> 00:25:26.047
Speaking of which, why are you
wearing different clothes? And your hair…

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:28.215
I don't even remember what she said.

00:25:28.299 --> 00:25:29.216
Don't worry.

00:25:30.926 --> 00:25:33.846
What about you? I feel like
you fought with her because of me.

00:25:38.684 --> 00:25:40.144
What's wrong?

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:42.521
Nothing. Let's eat.

00:25:42.605 --> 00:25:45.191
I figured you might be upset
about what happened yesterday,

00:25:45.274 --> 00:25:47.568
so I thought about
how to make you feel better

00:25:48.194 --> 00:25:51.655
But when you feel down,
there's no special cure.

00:25:52.448 --> 00:25:54.867
Eating something delicious
and sweating it out.

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:56.994
The simplest method is the best.

00:25:58.412 --> 00:25:59.246
All right.

00:26:02.833 --> 00:26:06.629
By sweating it out,
did you mean it literally?

00:26:07.338 --> 00:26:10.549
You can't take everything as a metaphor.

00:26:12.426 --> 00:26:15.346
What should I have you do
to make you sweat?

00:26:15.429 --> 00:26:17.390
Are there any skills you want to learn?

00:26:20.768 --> 00:26:21.685
Yes.

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:28.317
Skills I need... to protect myself.

00:26:31.487 --> 00:26:32.363
Good.

00:26:32.988 --> 00:26:36.158
I'll teach you properly,
so do your best, okay?

00:26:36.242 --> 00:26:38.411
Now, attack me.

00:26:42.331 --> 00:26:43.958
Block it like this,

00:26:44.041 --> 00:26:45.835
pull the arm like this,

00:26:45.918 --> 00:26:47.503
and choke the neck like this!

00:26:48.379 --> 00:26:51.507
Choke your opponent from behind
and kick the knee pit,

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:53.134
-then it's a rear choke.
-Stop.

00:26:53.968 --> 00:26:55.553
Understand? Got it?

00:26:56.262 --> 00:26:58.681
All right. Look at me.

00:27:02.393 --> 00:27:04.186
Yes! Pull!

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:08.566
Come on. Your right leg should move
to the back like this.

00:27:08.649 --> 00:27:09.567
Okay? Again.

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:11.152
-I see.
-All right.

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:14.822
Hold! Yes!

00:27:14.905 --> 00:27:15.906
Choke!

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:18.492
-From behind. What's next?
-Next?

00:27:18.576 --> 00:27:20.411
-The knee pit!
-What?

00:28:59.093 --> 00:29:00.386
Ms. Jeong.

00:29:12.022 --> 00:29:14.858
Let go of me. Let go.

00:29:15.818 --> 00:29:17.653
What on earth are you doing here?

00:29:17.736 --> 00:29:20.614
That Sun Jae-gyu guy is terrible.

00:29:21.156 --> 00:29:24.535
He's teaching her how to fight,
to become a thug.

00:29:27.705 --> 00:29:29.415
I should confess.

00:29:29.498 --> 00:29:30.583
Confess what?

00:29:32.334 --> 00:29:33.377
Your feelings for Bom?

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:36.630
I believed I could be helpful
because I like Bom.

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:40.926
I wanted to help you two
clear up your misunderstanding

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:42.094
and make up.

00:29:43.053 --> 00:29:45.097
But as a result, it's gotten worse.

00:29:46.223 --> 00:29:50.686
Before it's too late,
I'll go tell Bom everything about us.

00:29:52.187 --> 00:29:54.648
Hey, Attorney Choi. Choi I-jun!

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:26.055
What? Oh, no!

00:30:26.138 --> 00:30:28.057
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

00:30:30.017 --> 00:30:31.101
I'm sorry.

00:30:31.727 --> 00:30:33.228
Oh, no. Are you okay?

00:30:34.396 --> 00:30:36.023
I'm so sorry.

00:30:36.106 --> 00:30:39.276
I thought it was Mr. Sun
trying to make me practice.

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:41.153
-Are you hurt?
-I'm fine.

00:30:42.029 --> 00:30:44.573
Though my pride is a bit bruised.

00:30:47.951 --> 00:30:49.286
Choi I-jun?

00:30:52.998 --> 00:30:56.126
I'm here because I have something
to tell Ms. Bom.

00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:57.711
That's good.

00:30:57.795 --> 00:31:00.089
I also have something to tell you.

00:31:01.757 --> 00:31:03.384
The documents you gave me,

00:31:04.843 --> 00:31:08.722
the colleague of my colleague
finally read them today.

00:31:08.806 --> 00:31:10.516
The colleague of your colleague?

00:31:10.599 --> 00:31:12.351
I'm glad she read them.

00:31:13.018 --> 00:31:13.852
Anyway…

00:31:13.936 --> 00:31:16.230
She said she'd make up her mind soon.

00:31:17.731 --> 00:31:18.649
Is that so?

00:31:19.274 --> 00:31:22.236
If she comes to consult me,
I'll kindly help her.

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:24.988
You must be busy,
yet you're trying to help.

00:31:25.572 --> 00:31:27.533
Thank you so much, Mr. Choi.

00:31:30.828 --> 00:31:32.579
What? What's wrong?

00:31:33.247 --> 00:31:34.289
The thing you taught me…

00:31:35.249 --> 00:31:36.417
I did it to him.

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.377
-Good job.
-Let me have…

00:31:49.513 --> 00:31:54.184
For instance, using the dark theater
as an excuse for physical contact.

00:32:09.616 --> 00:32:11.660
Wow, my makeup's done so well today.

00:32:14.788 --> 00:32:16.915
This is the only way I can get that glow.

00:32:23.505 --> 00:32:24.590
Did you wait long?

00:32:27.092 --> 00:32:28.010
You look…

00:32:30.345 --> 00:32:31.346
pretty today.

00:32:33.557 --> 00:32:36.852
Not just today.
I'm planning to keep being pretty.

00:32:38.812 --> 00:32:40.981
What are you doing? Follow me.

00:32:50.407 --> 00:32:52.868
Physical contact…

00:32:56.288 --> 00:32:58.499
Considerate. Reliable.

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:29.613
Oh, no!

00:33:44.878 --> 00:33:47.130
I figured you'd be scared,
so I brought this.

00:33:50.968 --> 00:33:52.010
Hold it.

00:34:12.322 --> 00:34:14.741
The movie was so fun. Right?

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:17.160
I'm not sure.

00:34:18.495 --> 00:34:22.332
My heart felt cold,
and so did my hands, so…

00:34:23.667 --> 00:34:26.587
Did you… feel cold?

00:34:34.177 --> 00:34:35.137
Hey.

00:34:44.187 --> 00:34:45.188
Finally.

00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:56.408
Choi Se-jin!

00:34:57.743 --> 00:34:58.994
What are you doing?

00:35:01.914 --> 00:35:03.123
-That brat…
-You…

00:35:03.206 --> 00:35:04.207
-Goodness.
-I…

00:35:04.791 --> 00:35:07.961
finally held your hand, and I got busted.

00:35:18.347 --> 00:35:20.933
Didn't you skip your tutoring
because you were unwell?

00:35:21.725 --> 00:35:23.310
Come on.

00:35:23.393 --> 00:35:25.103
Finals ended just two days ago.

00:35:25.687 --> 00:35:26.605
Goodness.

00:35:29.608 --> 00:35:30.734
Hello.

00:35:30.817 --> 00:35:33.654
I'm Sun Han-gyul, Se-jin's classmate.

00:35:35.864 --> 00:35:39.451
Gosh. You should study at times like this
to catch up with the top student.

00:35:40.077 --> 00:35:42.162
While you're having fun with a boy,

00:35:42.245 --> 00:35:44.247
don't you think he must be studying?

00:35:44.331 --> 00:35:46.792
He's not studying today either.

00:35:46.875 --> 00:35:47.793
Really.

00:35:47.876 --> 00:35:51.254
Says her friend
who's nothing but handsome.

00:35:52.172 --> 00:35:53.048
Dad.

00:35:53.131 --> 00:35:54.591
In any case, Choi Se-jin,

00:35:54.675 --> 00:35:58.762
if you come second once again,
I will transfer you to another school.

00:35:58.845 --> 00:36:00.055
That will never happen.

00:36:03.767 --> 00:36:04.685
What?

00:36:04.768 --> 00:36:08.188
Se-jin worked really hard for finals.

00:36:08.271 --> 00:36:11.024
She was always the last one
to leave the library

00:36:11.108 --> 00:36:13.527
and went over the workbooks
again and again.

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:16.738
And she read the textbooks
until they were worn out.

00:36:19.157 --> 00:36:22.452
She never went out for tteokbokki
with her friends because she was studying,

00:36:23.078 --> 00:36:26.665
and she even brought
her English notes to the restroom.

00:36:28.625 --> 00:36:29.584
Se-jin.

00:36:31.795 --> 00:36:35.215
Don't worry. You worked so hard.

00:36:36.883 --> 00:36:40.262
You deserve to be the top student.

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:53.942
Where on earth are you?

00:36:54.026 --> 00:36:56.862
The schedule on set is all messed up
because of you.

00:36:56.945 --> 00:36:58.530
Oh, he's out.

00:36:58.613 --> 00:36:59.698
I'll call you later.

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.158
Bye.

00:37:51.875 --> 00:37:53.585
Is he unemployed or what?

00:37:53.668 --> 00:37:56.046
Where is he going at this hour?

00:38:13.772 --> 00:38:14.606
What?

00:38:15.649 --> 00:38:16.858
Where did he go?

00:38:21.655 --> 00:38:23.949
Hey. Let's stop here.

00:38:24.449 --> 00:38:26.451
Yesterday was leg day,
so my legs are sore.

00:38:27.035 --> 00:38:29.079
Who are you, following me like this?

00:38:29.162 --> 00:38:32.082
What? Did he know I was following him?

00:38:33.625 --> 00:38:36.336
If you go that way,
you might get into an accident.

00:39:15.375 --> 00:39:17.419
Oh, no! Mr. Sun!

00:39:17.502 --> 00:39:18.587
Oh, no.

00:39:19.171 --> 00:39:21.256
Mr. Sun! Wake up!

00:39:21.339 --> 00:39:22.924
Isn't that Han-gyul's uncle?

00:39:23.008 --> 00:39:25.177
Hey. Call 911.

00:39:28.597 --> 00:39:30.307
LEGAL BRIEFS

00:39:33.435 --> 00:39:35.645
Ms. Bom!

00:39:35.729 --> 00:39:37.731
Hey, what is it? What's wrong?

00:39:37.814 --> 00:39:41.401
Han-gyul's uncle got hit by a car
and has been taken to the hospital.

00:39:41.484 --> 00:39:42.360
What?

00:39:43.278 --> 00:39:44.779
Is he seriously hurt?

00:39:45.697 --> 00:39:47.699
Han-gyul's uncle... got hurt?

00:39:51.828 --> 00:39:53.496
It might be a concussion.

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:55.415
When you hit your head hard,

00:39:55.498 --> 00:39:58.460
it's common
to lose consciousness like this.

00:39:59.044 --> 00:40:01.421
It might be an epidural hemorrhage.

00:40:02.005 --> 00:40:05.508
When my aunt had a car accident,
she looked fine on the outside,

00:40:05.592 --> 00:40:08.261
but she fell into a coma
because of the hemorrhage.

00:40:09.429 --> 00:40:12.390
But he's not moving at all.
Maybe he's not in a coma

00:40:12.474 --> 00:40:14.559
but in a vegetative state.

00:40:16.186 --> 00:40:17.771
Boss!

00:40:18.521 --> 00:40:19.356
Boss!

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:21.483
-Hey.
-What?

00:40:23.902 --> 00:40:26.529
This is why I kept telling you

00:40:26.613 --> 00:40:30.200
to stop stepping up so recklessly
for others.

00:40:31.618 --> 00:40:32.869
It's not the time for this.

00:40:32.953 --> 00:40:35.205
Hey, guys. Is the car okay?

00:40:35.288 --> 00:40:36.790
-Sorry?
-What?

00:40:36.873 --> 00:40:38.541
If he was brought to the hospital,

00:40:38.625 --> 00:40:42.045
I bet the car's bumper or door
must be broken. Right?

00:40:42.921 --> 00:40:44.339
You're worried about the car?

00:40:44.422 --> 00:40:47.842
It's been over an hour,
but he hasn't woken up.

00:40:47.926 --> 00:40:49.719
Oh, no, Jae-gyu.

00:40:49.803 --> 00:40:50.887
I'm sure he's fine.

00:40:58.895 --> 00:41:00.647
-Uncle!
-Are you okay?

00:41:04.985 --> 00:41:06.444
Hey. He's alive!

00:41:06.528 --> 00:41:08.238
He's okay!

00:41:13.076 --> 00:41:15.120
Are you all here for me?

00:41:15.203 --> 00:41:17.998
I'm fine, so you can go back.

00:41:18.081 --> 00:41:20.041
Thank you for worrying about me. Hey.

00:41:22.502 --> 00:41:24.421
Gosh, is it a party or what?

00:41:26.089 --> 00:41:27.090
Doctor.

00:41:27.924 --> 00:41:29.134
What about the test results?

00:41:30.135 --> 00:41:33.305
Are your bones and tendons
made of iron and concrete?

00:41:33.388 --> 00:41:36.558
A car hit you, but you don't
even have a crack in your bones.

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:38.184
Look.

00:41:39.853 --> 00:41:44.274
In my 17 years as a doctor,
I've never seen such a beautiful scan.

00:41:44.357 --> 00:41:46.359
His head and neck are totally fine.

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:48.361
Let me check where you have pain.

00:41:48.445 --> 00:41:50.739
Where I have pain? Oh, here.

00:41:52.907 --> 00:41:53.950
Come on, be gentle.

00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:56.244
That's it?

00:41:56.828 --> 00:41:57.829
What's that?

00:42:00.081 --> 00:42:01.875
It won't leave a scar, will it?

00:42:04.169 --> 00:42:06.629
If you got enough sleep, you can go home.

00:42:06.713 --> 00:42:08.882
But while you're here, finish the IV.

00:42:11.676 --> 00:42:13.595
Gosh, this is like a piece of art.

00:42:13.678 --> 00:42:15.263
I want to keep a copy.

00:42:16.598 --> 00:42:18.266
-Let me see you. Let me.
-What?

00:42:18.892 --> 00:42:19.809
I'm fine.

00:42:21.728 --> 00:42:25.940
By the way, what about the woman he saved?

00:42:26.024 --> 00:42:27.400
Did you see her face?

00:42:27.484 --> 00:42:29.486
She was wearing a cap this low,

00:42:30.278 --> 00:42:32.489
so I couldn't see the face at all.

00:42:34.491 --> 00:42:37.160
How could she not even show her face?

00:42:37.243 --> 00:42:39.913
All right. I'm fine, so you can all leave.

00:42:39.996 --> 00:42:41.956
Thank you, Mr. Hong. Bye.

00:42:42.874 --> 00:42:44.250
-Don't do that.
-Phillip, go.

00:42:48.797 --> 00:42:49.631
Excuse me.

00:42:50.423 --> 00:42:53.259
I'd like to pay Sun Jae-gyu's bill.

00:42:53.343 --> 00:42:56.429
Isn't Han-gyul's uncle just amazing?

00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:00.892
She must have no conscience or shame.

00:43:00.975 --> 00:43:04.145
What kind of person runs off
when someone's hurt because of her?

00:43:04.229 --> 00:43:08.149
Well, she must have her reasons.

00:43:08.233 --> 00:43:11.319
It's finished.
You can go home after paying your bill.

00:43:11.403 --> 00:43:12.237
Thank you.

00:43:13.113 --> 00:43:14.656
What reasons?

00:43:14.739 --> 00:43:18.410
You saved her life.
Shouldn't she show her face at least?

00:43:19.202 --> 00:43:21.704
We should report people like her
to the police.

00:43:21.788 --> 00:43:23.415
-No, you can't.
-Why not?

00:43:26.376 --> 00:43:27.210
Well…

00:43:28.128 --> 00:43:29.879
To tell the truth, she is…

00:43:31.172 --> 00:43:32.215
She is…

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:37.512
Mr. Sun Jae-gyu! Mr. Sun!

00:43:38.138 --> 00:43:40.223
Oh, no. Wake up!

00:43:43.852 --> 00:43:45.437
It's Ms. Jeong Nan-hee.

00:43:49.649 --> 00:43:51.609
You mean my mom?

00:43:56.656 --> 00:43:58.950
I'm sure she can't come
even if she wants to.

00:43:59.033 --> 00:44:01.578
It's not easy for a celebrity
to come here.

00:44:01.661 --> 00:44:05.123
All the more reason
she should come and thank you.

00:44:05.206 --> 00:44:07.709
This isn't just being irresponsible.
It's shameless.

00:44:07.792 --> 00:44:10.211
But I'm totally fine.

00:44:11.921 --> 00:44:15.341
I'm okay, so stop being so mad. Calm down.

00:44:20.346 --> 00:44:22.056
Why should I do that?

00:44:25.143 --> 00:44:28.688
Why does everyone have to put up with her
when they suffer because of her?

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:36.613
Don't.

00:44:38.323 --> 00:44:40.992
Before you're a teacher,
you're Jeong Nan-hee's daughter.

00:44:41.868 --> 00:44:45.788
"The adulterous teacher is Jeong Nan-hee's
daughter." "A scandal with a married man."

00:44:45.872 --> 00:44:49.250
If such articles get published,
who will take the blow?

00:44:49.334 --> 00:44:50.627
Dad.

00:44:53.421 --> 00:44:55.882
What needs to be done needs to be done.

00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:58.760
Bom.

00:45:00.428 --> 00:45:01.513
Is it…

00:45:04.516 --> 00:45:05.600
really not true?

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:09.479
It felt like there was

00:45:10.813 --> 00:45:13.608
no one to lean on in the whole world.

00:45:15.443 --> 00:45:19.906
Like I had no reason to live…

00:45:22.575 --> 00:45:23.910
anymore.

00:45:34.045 --> 00:45:35.755
Why didn't you tell me?

00:45:38.132 --> 00:45:42.345
You should've told me all about it
so we could cry, get angry,

00:45:42.428 --> 00:45:45.098
and swear together.
Why did you bottle it up so long?

00:45:46.724 --> 00:45:50.853
There are things
that are painful just to talk about.

00:45:53.189 --> 00:45:55.275
The one I told Mr. Choi about.

00:45:55.942 --> 00:45:57.569
The colleague of my colleague.

00:46:02.907 --> 00:46:06.744
That's actually about me, not a colleague.

00:46:15.962 --> 00:46:17.589
-Let's go.
-Go where?

00:46:18.798 --> 00:46:20.633
Let's go tell I-jun to solve it.

00:46:21.634 --> 00:46:25.805
Just as you once told me,
what needs to be done needs to be done.

00:46:29.058 --> 00:46:29.892
Let's go.

00:46:36.232 --> 00:46:37.984
Darn it.

00:46:40.194 --> 00:46:42.780
You must be busy,
yet you're trying to help.

00:46:42.864 --> 00:46:44.532
Thank you so much, Mr. Choi.

00:46:47.035 --> 00:46:48.661
I should've confessed my feelings then.

00:46:49.245 --> 00:46:51.331
You shouldn't
confess your feelings rashly.

00:46:51.414 --> 00:46:53.875
You know, I did something similar
not long ago…

00:46:53.958 --> 00:46:56.502
Seriously, where on earth did they go?
Mr. Choi.

00:46:56.586 --> 00:46:59.797
Have you seen my cap and black hoodie
that I leave in the office?

00:46:59.881 --> 00:47:01.257
I swear I put them here.

00:47:05.511 --> 00:47:08.222
-There! My cap and hoodie!
-Hey…

00:47:09.098 --> 00:47:12.060
By the way, when did you come down here?

00:47:12.143 --> 00:47:14.979
Are you still here?
Are you really not leaving?

00:47:15.813 --> 00:47:18.399
I almost left this world
in a car accident. Happy?

00:47:19.609 --> 00:47:20.818
Again?

00:47:20.902 --> 00:47:23.571
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

00:47:23.655 --> 00:47:25.239
I'm not hurt.

00:47:25.823 --> 00:47:27.492
But Sun Jae-gyu is.

00:47:28.201 --> 00:47:29.410
Han-gyul's uncle?

00:47:29.994 --> 00:47:32.205
He saved me from getting hit by a car.

00:47:32.914 --> 00:47:35.416
If it weren't for him,

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:40.046
my photo would be either on the front page
of the newspaper or in the obituaries.

00:47:41.297 --> 00:47:42.840
He sure is amazing.

00:47:43.591 --> 00:47:46.386
No, he's the problem. He is.

00:47:46.969 --> 00:47:48.012
Anyway, Mr. Choi,

00:47:49.389 --> 00:47:53.309
you told me he ran off with your money
and that he was your archenemy.

00:47:53.393 --> 00:47:54.686
Is that really true?

00:47:55.770 --> 00:47:57.105
What do you mean?

00:47:57.188 --> 00:47:58.898
I mean, what you told me

00:47:59.482 --> 00:48:02.819
is so different from what I've heard
about him from other people.

00:48:04.404 --> 00:48:06.823
Still, it's such a relief that he's okay.

00:48:07.407 --> 00:48:10.368
Gosh, you're right.
My heart sank when I heard it.

00:48:11.035 --> 00:48:14.163
I just don't get
why you worry so much about him.

00:48:14.706 --> 00:48:15.790
Principal.

00:48:15.873 --> 00:48:19.794
Have you forgotten how he made a fuss
at school on the snowy day?

00:48:19.877 --> 00:48:22.880
Mr. Jeong, have you forgotten
he's nothing but a thug

00:48:22.964 --> 00:48:24.841
that hangs out with those big guys?

00:48:24.924 --> 00:48:26.718
Come on, they're not thugs.

00:48:27.427 --> 00:48:31.639
The guys that hang out with him
all train at my jiu jitsu gym.

00:48:32.223 --> 00:48:34.308
They may be big and look like thugs,

00:48:34.392 --> 00:48:38.980
but they're good guys who love tteokbokki
and jjolmyeon. Don't get them wrong.

00:48:39.063 --> 00:48:41.149
He's right. They're really good guys.

00:48:41.816 --> 00:48:46.028
And remember how he lifted a car
in front of my place?

00:48:46.112 --> 00:48:48.114
Turns out he did it for a fire truck.

00:48:48.197 --> 00:48:52.243
There was a fire, but it couldn't get in
because of the illegally parked car.

00:48:52.326 --> 00:48:55.121
I heard this from the nurse at the vet's.

00:48:55.204 --> 00:48:57.540
When he was shoveling in the woods,

00:48:57.623 --> 00:49:00.877
it was to save the dog
buried by the landslide.

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:02.295
You mean Bom-sik?

00:49:02.879 --> 00:49:05.339
How about your story? Is it true?

00:49:05.423 --> 00:49:06.549
What do you mean?

00:49:07.175 --> 00:49:10.928
The scar on your palm,
was it really Mr. Sun's doing?

00:49:12.513 --> 00:49:14.348
-Where's the restroom?
-That way.

00:49:14.432 --> 00:49:15.600
I'll be back.

00:49:15.683 --> 00:49:17.018
Just tell us.

00:49:17.101 --> 00:49:18.770
-Come on.
-Mr. Hong.

00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:26.778
Are you doubting me right now?

00:49:27.862 --> 00:49:30.531
Am I doubting you?

00:49:30.615 --> 00:49:33.493
Or are you slandering Sun Jae-gyu?

00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:37.663
Tell me.

00:49:38.247 --> 00:49:43.461
You didn't speak ill of him to me
on purpose, did you?

00:49:44.712 --> 00:49:45.546
What?

00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:50.676
You know, when you like someone,
sometimes you get jealous and twisted.

00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:53.387
You wanted to win Bom over,

00:49:53.471 --> 00:49:57.141
but when you realized
you had no chance against him…

00:50:05.107 --> 00:50:06.943
Everyone's being fooled!

00:50:10.321 --> 00:50:12.740
You asked me
what kind of person Sun Jae-gyu is?

00:50:14.867 --> 00:50:16.244
Jae-gyu is…

00:50:16.327 --> 00:50:18.162
What about Jae-gyu?

00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:20.915
What about Sun Jae-gyu, the son?

00:50:20.998 --> 00:50:21.833
That jerk is…

00:50:21.916 --> 00:50:23.042
He must've run off.

00:50:23.125 --> 00:50:25.044
Watch what you say.

00:50:25.127 --> 00:50:26.963
You don't know what happened.

00:50:27.046 --> 00:50:28.464
I saw it.

00:50:28.548 --> 00:50:30.883
In front of the underpass, a guy this big

00:50:30.967 --> 00:50:33.261
was running with a baby on his back.
I saw it.

00:50:33.344 --> 00:50:36.806
Are you saying the son ran off
after setting the house on fire?

00:50:36.889 --> 00:50:42.353
The father comes home wasted every day
and beats the son up.

00:50:42.436 --> 00:50:45.356
So how can he be in his right mind?

00:50:45.439 --> 00:50:46.941
I wouldn't put up with it.

00:50:48.192 --> 00:50:50.945
If I stayed home,
one of two things would happen, so I left.

00:50:52.363 --> 00:50:55.366
Either he'd end up killing me…

00:50:58.452 --> 00:51:00.121
or I'd end up killing him.

00:51:01.330 --> 00:51:02.874
Sun Jae-gyu, that jerk…

00:51:06.752 --> 00:51:08.754
killed his own father!

00:51:12.341 --> 00:51:13.175
What…

00:51:16.929 --> 00:51:19.932
What are you talking about?

00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:21.517
Sir.

00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:23.728
Mr. Choi.

00:51:24.854 --> 00:51:25.897
There.

00:52:13.319 --> 00:52:16.822
How did it go? How about Bom?
Did you see her? Is she doing okay?

00:52:16.906 --> 00:52:18.783
-Nothing's wrong, right?
-Honey.

00:52:19.325 --> 00:52:21.661
Let me get some sleep first.

00:52:21.744 --> 00:52:22.703
Of course.

00:53:08.457 --> 00:53:09.291
Ms. Bom.

00:53:12.378 --> 00:53:14.130
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:18.843
I've been running Ms. Jeong's fancafe
as her fan for a long time.

00:53:23.806 --> 00:53:25.808
I finally get it.

00:53:26.559 --> 00:53:29.437
Why you opened your office
in the countryside

00:53:29.979 --> 00:53:32.189
and how my mom knew everything about me.

00:53:33.733 --> 00:53:37.903
I admit I've been telling Ms. Jeong
how you were doing,

00:53:37.987 --> 00:53:40.698
but I swear
I didn't approach you on purpose.

00:53:41.657 --> 00:53:44.744
The day Se-jin came to Seoul,
I happened to find out where you lived,

00:53:45.244 --> 00:53:47.621
and it made me worry
about you living here alone.

00:53:48.581 --> 00:53:51.459
I thought it was a good chance
to help you two make up.

00:53:52.585 --> 00:53:54.712
That's why you kept
sending me the documents.

00:53:56.797 --> 00:54:00.259
Since you knew
what I'd gone through in Seoul.

00:54:02.511 --> 00:54:04.680
I understand why you're offended.

00:54:05.514 --> 00:54:10.019
But still,
I wanted to help you clear your name.

00:54:10.102 --> 00:54:11.771
What about Mr. Sun, then?

00:54:14.231 --> 00:54:17.735
What was your intention
when you slandered him like that?

00:54:20.196 --> 00:54:21.113
Slander?

00:54:26.577 --> 00:54:28.788
Do you think so too?

00:54:30.498 --> 00:54:33.542
That I…

00:54:37.838 --> 00:54:39.340
slandered Jae-gyu?

00:55:19.296 --> 00:55:22.216
Sun Jae-gyu, that jerk…

00:55:25.845 --> 00:55:27.847
killed his own father!

00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:35.479
Jae-gyu…

00:55:38.190 --> 00:55:39.400
Jae-gyu…

00:56:10.598 --> 00:56:12.349
Did you eat?

00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:23.819
MS. YOON BOM

00:56:50.179 --> 00:56:53.641
Turns out Mr. Choi is the president
of my mom's fancafe.

00:56:54.141 --> 00:56:57.436
Gosh, no wonder she knew exactly
how I was doing.

00:56:57.519 --> 00:56:59.146
The baeksuk too.

00:56:59.230 --> 00:57:02.483
Mr. Choi didn't make it.
He just delivered what my dad made.

00:57:07.905 --> 00:57:10.908
Should we just go back?

00:57:12.326 --> 00:57:13.661
Why aren't you asking?

00:57:17.623 --> 00:57:19.917
If you heard something like that
from I-jun,

00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:23.003
you should ask me if it's true.

00:57:24.213 --> 00:57:25.506
Why are you holding back?

00:57:27.258 --> 00:57:28.509
I'm not holding back.

00:57:29.635 --> 00:57:30.886
I trust you.

00:57:40.312 --> 00:57:41.146
Ms. Bom...

00:57:45.693 --> 00:57:47.361
listen carefully to…

00:57:49.571 --> 00:57:50.656
what I'm about to say.

00:57:54.618 --> 00:57:55.828
My father…

00:58:00.624 --> 00:58:01.834
My father…

00:58:10.801 --> 00:58:12.011
I killed him.

00:59:24.166 --> 00:59:27.795
I guess God left me this scar
so I wouldn't forget my sin.

00:59:27.878 --> 00:59:30.047
You've been looking
at your phone for days.

00:59:30.130 --> 00:59:32.091
The one who asked me about Bom…

00:59:32.174 --> 00:59:35.844
Strangely enough,
I see him everywhere I go lately.

00:59:35.928 --> 00:59:36.762
Hello?

00:59:36.845 --> 00:59:40.682
Reporters might come for you, Ms. Bom,
so go straight home.

00:59:40.766 --> 00:59:43.352
Turn off your phone now.
Don't read any comments.

00:59:43.435 --> 00:59:44.269
What do you mean?

00:59:44.353 --> 00:59:47.564
He told me to tell you not to worry
and to give you this.

00:59:47.648 --> 00:59:49.566
It might become a long day.

00:59:53.028 --> 00:59:55.030
