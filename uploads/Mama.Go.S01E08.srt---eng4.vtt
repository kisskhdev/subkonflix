00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.039
Welcome to Duxing University

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:31.600
Duxing University is a

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.039
comprehensive university with over

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:35.159
70 years of history

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.679
And the East Lake Jump

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:39.840
is one of Duxing U's most iconic events

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:54.119
Are you ready?

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.079
Let's start then

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:57.079
Come on

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:59.920
Three, two, one

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.840
Action

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:08.599
Say,

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:10.799
Kong Xiaocan...

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.439
what exactly is he thinking?

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.079
Didn't you say

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.280
an ex-boyfriend is as good as dead?

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.920
Who knew he could come back from the dead?

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:23.879
Did he come looking for you?

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.000
No

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.000
Sorry to disappoint you

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:35.760
It's just that...

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:38.439
he shouldn't be like this right now

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:40.239
Inconsistent

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.239
Contradicting himself

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.760
He should be

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.560
a bit simpler

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.280
and a bit happier

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.200
And I just feel like

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.120
things aren't how I imagined them

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:54.359
He's definitely hiding something from me

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.239
You don't still like him, do you?

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.599
No

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:04.319
Can the actor please get into character?

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:06.239
If we don't finish the promo video today

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.039
I'm going to be unhappy

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.919
You two are dragging your feet. It's annoying

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.960
Get ready to start

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:15.560
Perk up

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:17.280
Action

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:22.159
Welcome to Duxing University

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:24.080
Duxing University is a

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.120
comprehensive university with over

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.120
70 years of history

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:28.680
And the East Lake Jump

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.879
is one of Duxing U's most iconic events

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.120
We welcome freshmen to sign up!

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:43.919
Bro

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:44.800
Bro

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:49.199
I've asked around for you

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.000
For this year's freshmen East Lake Jump

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:55.120
Rui Jie is leading the team

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.120
This is the best chance for you two to break the ice

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.319
Bro, this is about your future happiness

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:04.080
You just need to show up on time

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.759
As for the rest

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.319
your brother Li has got it all arranged

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:08.080
Bro

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.360
You need to man up

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.520
What's the matter with you?

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.199
Rui Jie still has you in her heart

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.280
Did you forget I can't swim?

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:16.400
I've got you

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.719
Kong Xiaocan

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.280
Don't be so selfish

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:32.759
How many years can you be with someone?

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.120
I've thought it through

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:37.800
I'm not going to East Lake

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.759
What?

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.840
Say that again

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:42.960
I'm not going

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:44.199
I got so much stuff ready

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:45.199
And you just decide not to go?

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.159
I really want to send you flying with a slap

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.759
What about Xurui?

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.759
I don't care

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.080
Not being with me is what's best for her

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.719
Kong Xiaocan, is there something wrong with you?

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.039
Can't you speak clearly?

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.280
I know something happened to your family last year

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.639
You didn't want to say, so I didn't ask

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.360
That's because we aren't in that kind of

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.680
relationship where we need to explain everything

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:06.639
But Xurui is different, right?

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:08.039
Kong Xiaocan

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.360
Don't tell me

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.159
that from the very start

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:11.400
you never planned to be responsible

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:14.159
Am I that kind of person?

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:15.879
Then you really need to explain

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.000
Do you know how much you've changed this past year?

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.839
Where did my

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.160
brother from another mother

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.920
Kong Xiaocan go?

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.600
Fine, fine, fine

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.279
What is actually going on?

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:23.439
If you don't know what's going on, just...

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.800
Okay

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:25.759
Okay

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:27.720
I'll give you an example

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:28.759
Suppose

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:30.639
Just suppose

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.800
Suppose you were going to die tomorrow

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.240
And you knew it yourself

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:37.319
Would you tell the person you like

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:40.480
"Although I'm going to die tomorrow,"

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.000
"can we still be together today?"

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.959
"Even if just for one day"

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:45.480
Could you say that?

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.759
Do you even have to ask?

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.279
Yeah

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:48.639
Of course I'd say it!

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.199
No, why are you so selfish?

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:53.480
You're the selfish one!

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.759
You confess to someone

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:56.040
Does that mean they'll definitely agree?

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:58.480
You don't know what they're thinking

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.319
Do you know what Rui Jie thinks?

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.120
Unilateral breakup

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.439
Without giving a reason

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.800
And saying it's for their own good

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.079
That is what's selfish

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.439
Get it?

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:08.800
What if she doesn't forgive you?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.800
Still with the "suppose"?

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:21.240
Apology letter

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.600
For the College of Physical Education

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.959
Lin Xurui

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.920
It's me

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.000
Xurui

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:29.639
I know

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.040
you don't want to see me

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.600
but I still want to get this apology

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.160
to your ears

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:37.480
The grades

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.439
Point one

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:39.439
You're still the best

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:40.480
That incident with the scumbag that day

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:41.240
Xurui

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.800
It's not shameful

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:42.639
And it's not your fault

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.720
What are you doing?

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.680
We can carry it together

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.879
You were right to hit him

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:46.920
Shut up, you! Xurui

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:49.079
This...

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.040
Don't hit me

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:50.600
Stop

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.720
This is gonna kill someone!

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:02.480
Uh, Xurui, no...

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:03.839
I have some food for you

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:04.680
Take the food

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:05.439
I'm leaving

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:06.879
Uh, I swapped all your purple cabbage

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:07.879
for broccoli

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:10.839
Check before you eat, take a look

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:41.639
Grabbed a prime spot for you

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:44.120
Drink it while it's hot

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:14.959
It's finally off.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.000
Finally, I can drop two of my jobs.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.680
It's been hard on you.

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:19.439
Mom, let me... let me take another look.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.160
The hard days are almost over.

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:28.720
Mom. Mom. Son.

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:29.399
Mom! Oh, Mom!

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:30.959
It's been hard on you, Son.

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:41.279
Tell me,

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.920
if there was a woman

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.560
living with you,

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:45.480
and you were really close,

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:47.160
hugging and cuddling in public,

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:48.800
who would you think she is?

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.160
Definitely my wife.

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:51.240
Exactly.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.480
There's another possibility.

00:07:57.319 --> 00:07:57.800
What possibility?

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.120
My mom.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.720
Just eat your food.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.680
Suddenly a cousin pops up,

00:08:11.839 --> 00:08:12.879
and they're so close.

00:08:13.279 --> 00:08:14.120
Who are they trying to fool?

00:08:17.399 --> 00:08:18.560
But thinking about it carefully,

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.480
Kong Xiaocan doesn't have the guts to be a scumbag.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.439
And that talk about "blood is thicker than water."

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.240
If things aren't as simple as they seem,

00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:31.399
then what is really going on?

00:08:36.759 --> 00:08:38.120
If Kong Xiaocan won't talk,

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.600
can't I just find out myself?

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:55.720
Xurui

00:08:56.159 --> 00:08:56.919
Xurui, is that you?

00:09:04.519 --> 00:09:05.799
Uh, just getting some things.

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:06.600
Class is over, Xurui?

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.360
Are you hungry?

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:07.919
Have you eaten?

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:08.960
Should I go get you something?

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.960
You're in a good mood.

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:18.120
About that...

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.879
I don't usually tell people this.

00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:20.840
But since it's you...

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.519
My home...

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.399
...is being demolished.

00:09:25.559 --> 00:09:25.960
You have no idea...

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.360
...how hard this past year has been.

00:09:27.639 --> 00:09:28.440
And for Xiaocan too.

00:09:28.639 --> 00:09:30.200
Xiaocan works several jobs a day.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.080
Just to support this family.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.120
It's been exhausting.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.240
But it'll be better from now on.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.720
It's all good days ahead.

00:09:38.919 --> 00:09:39.799
Support the family?

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.039
You mean Xiaocan has been supporting the family all year?

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.080
I'm really not bragging.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.480
That kid Xiaocan...

00:09:48.559 --> 00:09:50.360
...he really is such a good kid.

00:09:50.519 --> 00:09:51.440
And in this past year...

00:09:51.519 --> 00:09:52.600
...he's become much more mature and steady.

00:09:52.799 --> 00:09:53.799
You can put him to the test.

00:09:53.919 --> 00:09:55.159
He definitely won't let you down.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:55.799
Really.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:56.919
Guifang.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:57.840
Been looking for you for ages.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.039
Go to Mr. Gao's...

00:09:59.039 --> 00:10:01.159
...and pick up the schedule for our event.

00:10:02.279 --> 00:10:04.720
And print the list of accompanying personnel too.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:06.799
Also buy me a bottle of water.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:07.720
You know what I like.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.039
Hey.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.559
Can you not...

00:10:10.559 --> 00:10:12.080
...always make freshmen run errands for you?

00:10:15.919 --> 00:10:16.440
What are you saying?

00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:18.120
What kind of talk is that?

00:10:18.519 --> 00:10:20.320
It's all work for the Student Union.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.039
How is it running errands just for me?

00:10:22.279 --> 00:10:23.639
I see the freshmen have initiative.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.240
Student Guifang here has high initiative, doesn't she?

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:26.720
Right?

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:27.919
Student Guifang?

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:28.879
Yes, yes, yes.

00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:30.200
I'll go buy it right now.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.200
Let me tell you...

00:10:35.559 --> 00:10:36.399
...don't go too far.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.080
I'm giving her a chance to improve herself.

00:10:44.039 --> 00:10:44.480
Xiaoyin.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.080
Why aren't you asleep yet?

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.879
Why are you back so late, Fang'er?

00:10:49.879 --> 00:10:50.919
Student Union meeting.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.320
After it ended...

00:10:52.559 --> 00:10:54.480
...Xiao Cao assigned me a bunch of tasks.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:55.639
Just finished.

00:10:56.519 --> 00:10:57.279
Xiao Cao?

00:10:57.679 --> 00:10:58.639
Your Vice President?

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.279
Why does he always boss you around?

00:11:02.759 --> 00:11:03.279
Maybe...

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.559
...the kid is just too tired and busy.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.600
Guifang, don't be such a pushover.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.000
I've heard about him before.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.600
He just likes throwing his weight around and making freshmen work.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.519
Your time is precious too.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.399
You only have so much free time.

00:11:16.519 --> 00:11:18.320
You can't let the Student Union take it all.

00:11:22.039 --> 00:11:22.960
Don't worry.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.600
I know what I'm doing.

00:11:25.759 --> 00:11:26.480
Alright, go to sleep.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:27.159
It's getting late.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.039
Alright then.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.120
I'll sleep after I finish sewing this.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:19.679
Fang'er

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:20.639
Fang'er

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:21.759
Fang'er

00:12:22.639 --> 00:12:23.039
Fang'er

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:24.360
Fang'er

00:12:25.679 --> 00:12:26.279
Fang'er

00:12:26.879 --> 00:12:27.200
Fang'er

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.799
Time to go to the library

00:12:29.159 --> 00:12:30.519
Fang'er, wake up. Get up

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:31.799
Fang'er

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:33.200
Fang'er

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:34.559
Wake up, wake up

00:12:35.159 --> 00:12:36.240
Xiaoyin

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.679
Why so early when there's no class, Xiaoyin?

00:12:38.679 --> 00:12:40.399
If you go late, there won't be seats in the library

00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:41.399
Or do you want us to save one for you?

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:42.960
Hurry up and get up

00:12:43.639 --> 00:12:44.120
I'm up, I'm up

00:12:45.039 --> 00:12:45.440
Zhuyun

00:12:46.279 --> 00:12:47.480
Have you finished memorizing the CET-4 words?

00:12:48.759 --> 00:12:49.120
Not yet

00:12:50.279 --> 00:12:51.039
Did you finish?

00:12:51.279 --> 00:12:52.480
It's nothing, just asking

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000
I'm relieved you haven't

00:12:54.879 --> 00:12:55.600
You scared me

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.120
It's still so early

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.559
It's not even light outside

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.399
It'll be too late by the time it's light

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:03.879
I'm going to save seats first

00:13:04.039 --> 00:13:04.600
You hurry up

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:12.360
Over here

00:13:13.519 --> 00:13:14.600
What took you so long?

00:13:15.039 --> 00:13:16.639
It was hard to get these seats. Quick, quick

00:13:26.799 --> 00:13:27.200
Guifang

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.279
Here

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.240
Come over here

00:13:31.759 --> 00:13:34.279
This is the daily life of college students now

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.799
Slacking off in class

00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:38.840
Grinding like crazy after class

00:13:41.039 --> 00:13:42.639
Then have I been wasting

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:43.879
Too much time elsewhere?

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.240
Immersive learning

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.120
Don't you guys dislike this major?

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.840
It's exactly because we don't like it and have no interest

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.399
That we have to work harder

00:14:00.919 --> 00:14:01.759
Otherwise we'll be even more useless

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:04.679
Lend me a pen

00:14:05.639 --> 00:14:06.000
Here

00:14:41.159 --> 00:14:42.519
So studious

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.200
Not like Kong Xiaocan at all

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.440
This movement

00:15:01.559 --> 00:15:03.600
Is exactly the same as Xiaocan's

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.519
Let's go. What are we eating later?

00:15:07.919 --> 00:15:08.720
Your shoelace is untied, Guifang

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.200
What did they cover today?

00:15:15.759 --> 00:15:17.559
This way of tying shoelaces

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.720
Is also exactly the same as Xiaocan's

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:22.879
Okay

00:15:24.159 --> 00:15:24.559
Guifang

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:26.000
My mom said she wants to send me fruit

00:15:26.039 --> 00:15:26.799
And send some to your parents too

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:27.720
No need

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.480
There's only two people at home right now

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:30.399
No one else

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.320
Thanks to your mom

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:31.879
Okay

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Just two people

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:33.600
Mom

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:34.320
Does she mean her and Xiaocan?

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.360
Guifang said no need, thank you

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.080
There isn't even an adult in the house

00:15:40.919 --> 00:15:41.399
Fangfang

00:15:41.759 --> 00:15:43.759
I saw a Hunan restaurant opened at the school gate

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:44.960
But it's a bit spicy

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.000
Xu Qian and the others can't handle it

00:15:46.399 --> 00:15:47.240
Can you eat spicy food?

00:15:47.399 --> 00:15:48.519
I can't really eat spicy food either

00:15:49.039 --> 00:15:49.879
Then what do you like to eat?

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:50.919
Sour stuff, I guess

00:15:51.759 --> 00:15:52.279
Let me tell you

00:15:52.279 --> 00:15:53.840
The vinegar cabbage I make is delicious

00:15:54.039 --> 00:15:54.919
I'll make it for you next time

00:15:55.399 --> 00:15:55.679
Sure

00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:01.000
Vinegar cabbage is my absolute favorite

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.039
Her taste is exactly the same as Xiaocan's too

00:16:09.799 --> 00:16:11.120
There are still mosquitoes in this season?

00:16:12.559 --> 00:16:14.679
Maybe because I'm Type O, I attract mosquitoes

00:16:17.879 --> 00:16:19.240
I'm Type O too. We're a perfect match

00:16:20.039 --> 00:16:21.919
Blood type is the same too

00:16:24.799 --> 00:16:26.000
Could it be

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:32.320
They really are long-lost biological siblings?

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.159
Junior's back.

00:16:47.159 --> 00:16:47.639
Come here.

00:16:47.879 --> 00:16:48.879
Thanks for the hard work.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.080
But I have to trouble you again.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.440
We need to take these registration forms...

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.720
...and sort them into three groups by grade and college.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.279
Two buses for each group.

00:16:59.399 --> 00:17:00.720
Then why didn't you say so earlier?

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:01.879
If you had told me earlier...

00:17:01.879 --> 00:17:03.279
...I would've sorted them while collecting them.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.519
I just got the notice myself.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:07.400
Junior.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:08.559
Please sort them out.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:09.960
Just give them to me tomorrow morning.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:12.359
I have something to do.

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:13.000
I'm heading out first.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.559
Alright, alright. Go get busy.

00:17:15.799 --> 00:17:17.000
Off to work!

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:17.960
This kid...

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:36.519
Xiaoyin, you're here.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.799
Fangfang, why are you still working on this?

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.039
Aren't you going to eat?

00:17:41.279 --> 00:17:42.359
I'll go after I finish these.

00:17:43.839 --> 00:17:44.920
It's that Cao Gang again, isn't it?

00:17:47.039 --> 00:17:48.119
It's fine, it's not much.

00:17:48.279 --> 00:17:49.119
I'll be done in a bit.

00:17:49.519 --> 00:17:50.359
What do I do? I'll help you.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:51.400
No, no, no need.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.599
You just sit and rest.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.759
You know, those studying in the library...

00:18:02.759 --> 00:18:03.720
...are doing it for guaranteed grad school admission.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.079
Those selling stuff in the dorms are doing it to make money.

00:18:06.279 --> 00:18:07.960
What are you wearing yourself out for?

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.119
It's just lending a hand.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:11.599
If I can help, I help.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:13.759
You college students are all busy.

00:18:14.279 --> 00:18:14.799
I understand.

00:18:15.759 --> 00:18:16.920
But you're a college student too.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.039
I'm different.

00:18:31.599 --> 00:18:32.200
Brother Maizi, bye.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.279
Bye? What bye-bye?

00:18:34.359 --> 00:18:35.079
Did you forget something?

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.000
Right.

00:18:36.359 --> 00:18:36.799
I forgot.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:41.359
How many times have I said it?

00:18:42.279 --> 00:18:43.319
Okay, okay, okay.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.279
Let me, let me, let me.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Can't even take off clothes properly?

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:47.960
Come here. How did I teach you?

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.240
Forty-five degrees downward.

00:18:50.519 --> 00:18:51.720
This outfit is precious.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.680
If this leather gets wrinkled...

00:18:54.559 --> 00:18:55.400
...it'll be hard to return.

00:18:55.759 --> 00:18:56.279
Come on, necklace.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.079
I'll do it, I'll do it.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:00.240
This thing...

00:19:00.359 --> 00:19:02.079
...if you break it, we have to pay for it.

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:02.759
Watch.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:05.279
I'll wear it.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.079
Shoes.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:09.680
Soles.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.319
It's fine.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:13.759
How many times have I told you?

00:19:13.799 --> 00:19:14.960
Keep a low profile. Low profile.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:15.559
Where's your mask?

00:19:15.799 --> 00:19:16.440
Take out your mask. Come on.

00:19:18.279 --> 00:19:19.079
You never bring anything with you.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.200
If someone snaps a photo of you living here...

00:19:21.359 --> 00:19:23.119
...your image will be ruined, you know?

00:19:24.799 --> 00:19:27.319
Wearing the mask makes you look even more like a star.

00:19:27.319 --> 00:19:28.359
Come on, take it off. Take it off.

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:35.319
About the car...

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:37.400
Alright, go back inside.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.200
Be careful.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.599
Don't just talk to anyone.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:41.440
Lock the doors and windows tight.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:41.960
Okay.

00:19:44.039 --> 00:19:44.319
Let's go.

00:19:53.759 --> 00:19:54.200
Xiaotian.

00:19:55.559 --> 00:19:55.920
Xiaotian.

00:19:57.119 --> 00:19:57.559
Guifang.

00:19:58.839 --> 00:19:59.720
Long time no see.

00:20:00.039 --> 00:20:01.640
Did you just come back from school?

00:20:02.119 --> 00:20:02.519
How about you?

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:04.039
Lately, I don't seem...

00:20:04.039 --> 00:20:05.599
...to have seen you at school much.

00:20:06.279 --> 00:20:08.279
I haven't been there a single day since registration.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.640
Brother Maizi said I have a lot of work piled up.

00:20:11.039 --> 00:20:12.160
I can't go back to school until it's done.

00:20:13.279 --> 00:20:14.279
You haven't gone a single day?

00:20:15.119 --> 00:20:16.559
Then didn't you get in for nothing?

00:20:18.599 --> 00:20:19.599
I won't get expelled, will I?

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:20.680
Probably not.

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.079
I don't think so.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.200
How many days of leave did you take?

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:25.960
I'll go ask for you.

00:20:26.759 --> 00:20:27.880
I'm in the Student Union now.

00:20:29.359 --> 00:20:30.000
That's impressive.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:31.400
It's alright.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.240
Just organizing activities...

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:33.880
...doing odd jobs...

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.160
...and running errands.

00:20:36.079 --> 00:20:36.759
That busy, huh?

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:38.799
But Brother Maizi said...

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:39.640
...being busy...

00:20:39.759 --> 00:20:41.759
...means your ability is recognized.

00:20:42.039 --> 00:20:43.039
It shows you're capable.

00:20:45.599 --> 00:20:46.839
You don't actually think...

00:20:47.519 --> 00:20:49.759
...that it's because you're talented enough...

00:20:50.119 --> 00:20:52.000
...that you're assigned so much work, do you?

00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:53.200
Isn't that right?

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:57.799
Forget it.

00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.599
I have no right to lecture you either.

00:21:01.119 --> 00:21:01.759
The two of us...

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.160
...are both being treated like pushovers.

00:21:38.279 --> 00:21:39.640
Finally, it's the weekend.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.640
I'm done with the Student Union chores too.

00:21:42.119 --> 00:21:43.880
I'm definitely going to get some good rest today.

00:21:44.079 --> 00:21:45.160
Cousin, are you home?

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.319
My mom bought matsutake and asked me to bring some over.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.720
We can make soup with it.

00:21:49.079 --> 00:21:49.559
Xiaocan.

00:21:50.119 --> 00:21:50.599
Are you there?

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:51.319
Are you there?

00:21:51.319 --> 00:21:52.240
Coming, coming.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.759
Are you there? Are you there? Are you there?

00:21:54.039 --> 00:21:55.319
Open the door. Open the door. Open the door.

00:21:55.839 --> 00:21:56.480
Are you there? Are you there? Are you there?

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.680
I'm just destined to toil.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.200
Coming, coming.

00:22:05.359 --> 00:22:05.720
Cousin.

00:22:07.039 --> 00:22:07.920
That kitchen knife is too dangerous.

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:08.839
Let me do it.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:10.799
I'll do it, I'll do it.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.480
In the past, just cutting vegetables,

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.440
you'd cut your hand.

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:14.079
And now you're chopping meat?

00:22:14.279 --> 00:22:14.519
Go.

00:22:14.799 --> 00:22:15.720
You soak the matsutake for me.

00:22:18.359 --> 00:22:20.640
This Kong Xiaocan really tells people everything.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.519
Don't use cold water, use hot water.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.079
You sure know a lot.

00:22:27.119 --> 00:22:27.519
Come, come, come.

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.000
Use this. Hot water.

00:22:48.599 --> 00:22:49.680
Cousin is cooking for me.

00:22:51.039 --> 00:22:51.839
Cousin likes me.

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.000
Their family tradition is to take the mother's surname.

00:22:54.839 --> 00:22:55.680
Future children will be named Kong.

00:22:56.839 --> 00:22:57.359
I have no problem with that.

00:23:01.079 --> 00:23:01.559
What are you smiling at?

00:23:01.759 --> 00:23:02.319
I have no problem.

00:23:04.039 --> 00:23:04.880
Then wash the vegetables for me.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:05.920
No problem.

00:23:17.799 --> 00:23:18.319
By the way,

00:23:19.519 --> 00:23:20.839
I've joined the Student Union now.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.400
So fast?

00:23:22.559 --> 00:23:23.279
That's impressive.

00:23:23.559 --> 00:23:24.319
It's alright, it's alright.

00:23:26.759 --> 00:23:27.720
I heard...

00:23:28.119 --> 00:23:30.319
our Student Union's Vice Minister...

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.440
is Xurui, right?

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.480
Rui Jie? I know her too well.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:34.960
Really?

00:23:36.759 --> 00:23:38.240
Xurui is a good kid.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:40.920
I heard...

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.240
she and Xiaocan were a couple.

00:23:43.839 --> 00:23:45.400
I get angry just mentioning this.

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:46.799
What's wrong?

00:23:47.079 --> 00:23:48.240
You talk about Kong Xiaocan...

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.680
he chased her but didn't cherish her.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.079
He even initiated the breakup.

00:23:51.559 --> 00:23:52.799
Initiated the breakup?

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:54.359
Why?

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.480
No... Xurui is such a good girl.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.440
Why break up?

00:23:58.960 --> 00:23:59.599
Xiaocan...

00:24:00.319 --> 00:24:01.240
suddenly said...

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:02.680
something big happened at home.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.279
Said he had to suspend his studies to support the family.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:06.400
Said he didn't want to hold Xurui back.

00:24:06.759 --> 00:24:08.039
So he unilaterally broke up with her.

00:24:08.519 --> 00:24:09.359
That was because of me.

00:24:10.279 --> 00:24:10.839
No.

00:24:11.359 --> 00:24:13.920
How... how could it be because of you?

00:24:14.119 --> 00:24:15.319
It refers to Godmother getting sick.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:16.680
It definitely has nothing to do with you.

00:24:17.519 --> 00:24:18.759
Isn't that exactly because of me?

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.680
Well, if you insist on putting it that way...

00:24:25.039 --> 00:24:25.519
I guess so.

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:26.599
Look...

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.200
if Godmother hadn't gotten sick,

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.160
you wouldn't have been able to come here.

00:24:29.519 --> 00:24:30.640
If you hadn't come here,

00:24:32.839 --> 00:24:34.240
then... then we wouldn't have met.

00:24:38.319 --> 00:24:38.920
But Cousin,

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:39.920
don't worry.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.279
Xiaocan...

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.440
still really wants to win Xurui back.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.920
And Xurui has never let go of Xiaocan either.

00:24:45.319 --> 00:24:46.960
The bond between them never really shattered.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:47.799
They'll definitely get back together.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.680
The main thing is, with a genius like me here...

00:24:51.519 --> 00:24:52.319
with my divine assist...

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:53.480
there will be no problem.

00:24:54.279 --> 00:24:54.960
Regarding this matter,

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.200
don't feel burdened.

00:25:00.039 --> 00:25:00.440
Okay.

00:25:01.759 --> 00:25:03.480
Then don't tell him I know about this either.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.759
I don't want him to feel burdened.

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:07.000
Cousin,

00:25:08.279 --> 00:25:09.039
this mouth of mine...

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.119
is famously tight.

00:25:28.519 --> 00:25:28.920
Bro

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:31.720
Look at the time

00:25:33.039 --> 00:25:34.160
Why did you call me out here?

00:25:34.839 --> 00:25:35.440
To wait for Xurui

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.400
This is the path she takes for training

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.160
You finally figured it out

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.319
Then couldn't you just wait for her yourself?

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.640
Why did you call me?

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.000
I was afraid I'd be bored

00:25:48.839 --> 00:25:50.519
But we don't need to play basketball this early

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:51.440
There is no "we"

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:52.119
It's you

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:53.440
I was afraid *you* would be bored

00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:58.920
I'll eat breakfast first

00:25:59.319 --> 00:25:59.599
Don't move

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:00.640
That's for your girl

00:26:01.599 --> 00:26:03.319
You go do some fasted cardio

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.160
I won't do fasted cardio then

00:26:06.519 --> 00:26:06.839
Go on

00:26:11.799 --> 00:26:12.119
Fine

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:15.440
So my good bro can get back together with his girl

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:17.200
Bro is going all out

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:43.200
Bro

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.880
This burger is going to go bad in a minute

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.960
If Rui Jie eats this

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:48.599
She's gonna get a stomachache

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:49.680
I'm scared just thinking about it for you

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.000
You have to thank me

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:57.960
Wait, are we still waiting?

00:26:58.599 --> 00:26:59.640
I called and she didn't pick up

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:00.759
Sent messages and she hasn't replied yet

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.359
Should we take off?

00:27:04.759 --> 00:27:05.960
I saved that bite of meat for last

00:27:07.559 --> 00:27:08.119
You leave

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:09.759
Then I'm taking off too

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.079
I'm going back to catch up on sleep

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:13.319
Bro

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:14.200
Ball

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:36.440
Bro

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:37.680
Are you okay?

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:42.599
Are you blind?

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:44.400
Sorry

00:27:54.839 --> 00:27:55.319
You okay?

00:27:56.799 --> 00:27:58.000
You've got a nosebleed

00:28:00.119 --> 00:28:00.440
I'm fine

00:28:10.559 --> 00:28:10.880
Buddy

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.039
Let's go to the infirmary

00:28:12.519 --> 00:28:13.240
Go get checked out

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.359
He bled for me

00:28:17.519 --> 00:28:18.039
Within three minutes

00:28:18.039 --> 00:28:20.000
I want all of this guy's info

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.319
Guifang, we're leaving first

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:37.400
Okay, okay

00:28:55.039 --> 00:28:55.599
Little Rui

00:28:56.039 --> 00:28:57.319
I have something to tell you

00:28:57.559 --> 00:28:58.519
It's about Xiaocan

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:00.759
So sudden

00:29:01.359 --> 00:29:01.759
Go ahead

00:29:02.279 --> 00:29:02.839
Little Rui

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.359
I'm very sorry

00:29:04.359 --> 00:29:06.240
I can't tell you the whole truth

00:29:06.839 --> 00:29:08.279
But I can tell you honestly

00:29:09.119 --> 00:29:11.720
I am much older than I look

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.759
Old enough to have a son who can run errands

00:29:17.759 --> 00:29:19.200
My son is Kong Xiaocan

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:23.480
She and Kong Xiaocan have a son

00:29:34.279 --> 00:29:35.039
Our family

00:29:35.359 --> 00:29:36.880
Went through a huge change

00:29:37.079 --> 00:29:39.319
It was Xiaocan who shouldered all the responsibility

00:29:39.759 --> 00:29:40.720
Supporting the family

00:29:41.039 --> 00:29:42.880
So that I could prepare for exams with peace of mind

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.000
If it weren't for Xiaocan

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.799
I wouldn't even have the chance to go to college

00:29:46.359 --> 00:29:47.240
Understood

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.440
All the clues connect now

00:29:49.799 --> 00:29:51.160
My cousin is definitely my blood relative

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:51.920
Only two people in the family for now

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:52.680
Must be the wife

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.160
Old enough to have a son who can run errands

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:55.319
Anyway

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:56.720
Xiaocan

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:58.759
Is a particularly responsible child

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.440
Do you understand what I mean?

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.240
Xiaocan

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.400
Mom can only help you this far

00:30:11.799 --> 00:30:13.960
That goddamn scumbag

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:14.880
I understand

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:16.920
You've suffered

00:30:18.079 --> 00:30:18.599
You've suffered

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.519
I feel like I explained it clearly.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:35.799
Xurui should have understood.

00:30:36.599 --> 00:30:37.720
Then I can rest easy.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:40.880
Brother Si.

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:43.880
Help me think of something.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:45.279
What should I do?

00:30:46.039 --> 00:30:47.599
How can I get Xurui to make up with me?

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:51.000
Kong Xiaocan!

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:52.720
Xurui!

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.240
You jerk!

00:30:58.119 --> 00:30:59.599
You and Kong Guifang even have a child!

00:30:59.599 --> 00:31:00.240
And you still come looking for me?

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:01.440
Let me tell you,

00:31:02.039 --> 00:31:03.200
don't let me see you ever again!

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.319
No, her? What about her? Who?

00:31:05.759 --> 00:31:06.559
Kong Gui... and I...

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:06.960
No...

00:31:07.359 --> 00:31:08.039
This is a misunderstanding!

00:31:08.039 --> 00:31:09.319
No, Kong Guifang does have a child.

00:31:09.319 --> 00:31:09.759
But I don't.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.440
Kong... Kong Guifang doesn't have one now.

00:31:12.799 --> 00:31:14.000
The child... she... she...

00:31:14.319 --> 00:31:15.319
She just doesn't have a child!

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.599
It's gone!

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:17.119
Gone!

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.119
You... listen to my explanation!

00:31:19.119 --> 00:31:20.039
You jerk!

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.119
You have a child and won't admit it?

00:31:22.319 --> 00:31:22.640
I didn't!

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.160
Be a human being, you jerk! Get lost!

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:25.720
Don't follow me!

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:46.559
Guifang.

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:47.880
Xurui.

00:31:48.519 --> 00:31:49.039
About this matter...

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.599
I shouldn't have told you,

00:31:50.759 --> 00:31:52.079
but today you must listen to me.

00:31:52.799 --> 00:31:54.240
Kong Xiaocan is a scumbag.

00:31:54.559 --> 00:31:55.200
One word: Split.

00:31:55.519 --> 00:31:56.039
Three words:

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:56.720
Split right now.

00:31:56.799 --> 00:31:57.200
Break up.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:58.880
No, wait.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.599
How is Xiaocan a scumbag?

00:32:00.799 --> 00:32:01.640
What happened?

00:32:01.799 --> 00:32:02.519
What break up?

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.839
You're still in the dark?

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.839
Kong Xiaocan won't even acknowledge your child.

00:32:10.119 --> 00:32:10.720
Break up immediately.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:11.160
Child?

00:32:11.799 --> 00:32:12.559
I'll raise it for you.

00:32:12.759 --> 00:32:13.160
Break up!

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:14.000
No...

00:32:14.759 --> 00:32:15.960
What do you mean you'll raise my child?

00:32:16.279 --> 00:32:18.480
I have a child with Kong Xiaocan?

00:32:21.119 --> 00:32:22.680
Don't you and Kong Xiaocan have a child?

00:32:22.839 --> 00:32:23.960
Who told you that?

00:32:24.039 --> 00:32:25.000
You said it!

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:27.359
You said you and Xiaocan have a child,

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.960
and the child is quite big already.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000
That's why Xiaocan had to earn money to support the family.

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:32.680
Stop.

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:34.200
What I meant was...

00:32:34.599 --> 00:32:35.640
there are just two people in our family.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:36.640
Since I'm preparing for exams,

00:32:36.759 --> 00:32:38.319
Kong Xiaocan has to focus on supporting the family.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:46.599
No...

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.880
You got pregnant unexpectedly,

00:32:49.279 --> 00:32:51.200
so Xiaocan had to drop out of school.

00:32:51.359 --> 00:32:52.960
You didn't tell us because...

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.160
I am his mom.

00:33:04.319 --> 00:33:04.799
Who?

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:13.559
I am his mom.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.160
I had a serious illness,

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.319
and used an experimental drug.

00:33:17.519 --> 00:33:18.599
That's why I look like this now.

00:33:18.759 --> 00:33:20.039
I look a bit young,

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.480
but I don't have a child.

00:33:26.519 --> 00:33:27.319
Really.

00:33:27.839 --> 00:33:29.640
At least give me a chance to explain!

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.279
I'm an innocent guy!

00:34:10.079 --> 00:34:11.159
When is the East Lake Jump?

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:18.760
Take a look.

00:34:23.719 --> 00:34:25.039
What are you showing me?

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:29.760
Just look.

00:34:30.199 --> 00:34:30.840
That expression...

00:34:31.599 --> 00:34:32.199
The hand...

00:34:33.519 --> 00:34:33.960
The eyes...

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:42.840
Although I don't know about your high school days,

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.920
judging from this period of time,

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:46.840
I think Kong Xiaocan is a jerk.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.039
But after editing just now,

00:34:52.119 --> 00:34:52.920
I feel...

00:34:54.519 --> 00:34:56.360
you still care about him.

00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:58.639
You really like him, really love him.

00:35:04.719 --> 00:35:05.400
Xurui.

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.000
What are you doing here?

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:12.239
I came to eat with you.

00:35:12.599 --> 00:35:13.360
I just went to find Xiaocan.

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.639
He said he's in a bad mood and wouldn't eat with me.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:15.519
Let's eat together then.

00:35:16.519 --> 00:35:17.239
Not in the mood.

00:35:20.719 --> 00:35:22.960
These two are really worrying.

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.960
Isn't that because of your good friend Kong Xiaocan?

00:35:26.519 --> 00:35:27.400
When he was good with Xurui,

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:28.599
it felt like he'd give his life for her.

00:35:29.079 --> 00:35:29.960
One minute he disappears,

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.360
the next he's suddenly all affectionate.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:32.960
I don't know what he's thinking.

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:34.280
It's so annoying.

00:35:38.519 --> 00:35:39.280
I'm annoyed too.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:41.920
What should we eat?
