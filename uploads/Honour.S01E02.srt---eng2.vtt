Yoo Jeong.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.640
Oh, my gosh, what happened?

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.250
What happened? What's wrong?

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.720
Help her up. We need to get out of here.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.320
I...

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.160
killed someone.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.570
- What's going on? - She said she killed someone.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.770
- She did what? - Oh, gosh.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.020
Jun Hyeok.

Jun Hyeok.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.160
Someone...

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.460
I think someone's hurt.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.960
I heard a scream too.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.430
It's a house in front of the park in Jungam-dong, Seongin-gu.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.670
Okay, we have your report. May I have your name, please?

(Episode 2)

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.020
Where are you? We're at Hankuk Hospital. You need to get here...

Shin Jae.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.730
Come pick me up. Hurry.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.100
- You go on ahead. - Is that Hyun Jin? What's wrong?

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.700
I don't know. I'll call you.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.920
Are you hurt?

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.090
Okay, then.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:09.820
Shin Jae.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.960
Jun Hyeok is...

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.400
He's dead.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.370
What?

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.030
Jun Hyeok...

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.540
He's dead.

(Operating Room)

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.720
Attorney Yoon. What happened? How's Yoo Jeong?

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.690
Yoo Jeong.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.160
- How is she? Is she okay? - Fortunately, the wound isn't deep.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.070
For now, we're moving her to a regular room,

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.900
and the doctor will explain it all when they come out.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.070
Guardian, this way, please.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.870
You need to handle the admission paperwork.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.350
Yoo Jeong. What do you mean you killed someone?

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.720
Who did you kill?

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.390
Reporter Lee Jun Hyeok.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.860
What? What are you talking about?

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.130
We're moving her to her room now.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.870
Ms. Jo Yoo Jeong's guardian?

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.570
We've stitched up the abdominal wound.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.380
There was some bleeding, but she's stable now.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.710
However,

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.050
there's trauma to her genital area,

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.650
and she has severe internal bleeding in her pelvis.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.660
Sexual assault. Is that what you're suggesting?

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.140
Leave the clothes. I'll get rid of them.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.310
What in the world just happened?

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.980
Shouldn't we go to the police?

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.120
Then why did you take Reporter Lee's phone?

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.160
Did you sleep with him that night? With Reporter Lee?

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.670
My conversations with him are on it.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.240
If the police get ahold of this, Seon Kyu will find out.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.210
I wasn't in my right mind. Not today, and not that day either.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.420
Shin Jae.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.290
I can't do this.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.590
- I should just tell the police... - Hwang Hyun Jin.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.090
Get a grip.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.830
Our DNA...

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.600
The police still have it.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.469
Attempting to destroy evidence, fleeing the scene...

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:12.840
You're the prime suspect right now.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.010
If you're investigated, do you think your past won't come out?

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:22.050
(Ra Young)

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.680
- Hello? - Are you with Hyun Jin?

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.460
Yes, she's right here.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.460
Reporter Lee has been murdered.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.700
It's not in the news yet.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:41.100
I know.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.399
- You know? - I need you both at the hospital...

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.400
right now.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:53.180
(Hankuk University Hospital)

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.280
That you murdered the victim, Lee Jun Hyeok.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:59.050
Do you admit it?

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:02.920
Where did you murder the victim?

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:04.560
At his house.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.690
Reporter Lee's house.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.290
Why did you go to the victim's house?

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.000
I was at my lawyer's house,

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.730
and he called and asked me to come over.

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:17.840
What was the murder weapon?

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.240
A knife from the kitchen.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.480
And where did you stab him?

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:27.110
In the stomach.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:29.850
Is that true?

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.520
Why did you attack the victim?

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.490
Let me ask you again. Why did you murder the victim?

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:53.640
Reporter Lee... He...

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.610
He raped me.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:16.090
Can you describe the circumstances of the assault in more detail?

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.600
That's enough for today.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:25.900
You have a sufficient confession.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:27.810
She'll give any further statements at the next session.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:47.560
(Forensics)

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.830
(Detective)

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.700
You're here. Let's head in.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.930
For goodness' sake.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.740
My gosh.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:02.640
This isn't my fault, is it? It's yours.

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:04.440
You're the one who taught me this bad habit.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:06.910
Are you going to make the forensics guys do all that extra work again?

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:09.710
How many times do they have to filter out your DNA?

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:14.550
Hey, we got a full confession. Why check for butts? Let's go.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.920
Gosh.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:41.980
What is it?

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:44.580
The Korean Journalism Award?

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.990
See? You can't trust people who act all high and mighty.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.260
They're the ones who are always rotten to the core.

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:58.760
A reporter, of all people, preying on a kid.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.530
It is pretty shocking, though.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.070
Why? You know him?

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:08.870
Not me. Hyun Jin does.

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:10.439
Your wife does?

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.640
- Sir! - Yes.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.450
I got it.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.410
What is it?

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.060
Detective!

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:03.390
Yes?

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:08.900
- What is it? - This was wedged in the mattress.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.570
- Is this the victim's? - We'll have to run it and see.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:25.179
What do you mean, "The Kang Eun Seok Seductress Murder Case"?

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.490
You can't just post such a malicious article!

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.249
Yes, the press release will go out shortly.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:32.160
Why haven't you taken down the unblurred photo yet?

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.660
What do you mean, a server issue?

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.360
This is Yoon Ra Young. Take it down in three minutes, or we file a suit.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:40.230
Penalties are harsher for a minor. You have three minutes.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.270
- You're here. - What's all this?

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:45.440
Case law on self-defense. We have to try and make it stick.

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:48.009
Attorney Yoon, here's the schedule for the current affairs show.

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:50.070
They'll replace another panelist if you agree to come on.

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:53.240
The topic is confirmed, right? Expanding the scope of self-defense.

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:54.980
- Yes. - Great. Book it.

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:56.250
- Ra Young. - Also,

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:58.019
we must prove diminished capacity,

00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.720
so get Yoo Jeong's psych med history.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:05.460
Hold on, nothing has been decided yet.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:07.460
- What hasn't? - I said,

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:09.760
we still haven't decided whether we're taking this case.

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:12.860
What is there to decide? Of course this is our case.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:15.970
We need to talk.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:21.140
I don't believe Yoo Jeong's story.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:23.810
- What part of it? - The murder and the sexual assault.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.640
Yoo Jeong committed murder? And in such a brutal way?

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:30.680
And it just doesn't make sense that Jun Hyeok would hurt a source.

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:33.350
- Look, Jun Hyeok is... - Not the type of person to do that?

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:35.550
That's the one thing we've always hated hearing.

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:38.890
"He'd never do something like that." "He wouldn't hurt a fly."

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.160
And where are all those people now? We're the ones who put them away.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:46.000
Jun Hyeok was murdered right after he offered me the files.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.570
Am I really the only one who finds this all strange?

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:50.830
Yoo Jeong confessed herself. Why would she lie about that?

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:58.240
If it's about defending the person who killed Jun Hyeok...

00:13:58.340 --> 00:13:59.540
Hey, who said that's what this is about?

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:04.520
In any case, what's clear is that Jo Yoo Jeong has already lied.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.050
And she still hasn't told us the truth.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:11.360
As for us taking Jo Yoo Jeong's case...

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:13.720
One vote for, one vote against.

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:15.190
It's not that I'm against it.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.700
I'm just saying we should hold off until we can confirm the facts.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.700
I also vote to hold off.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.970
The forensics report comes out soon. We'll find out then.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.670
Whether she's telling the truth this time.

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:28.870
So we're just supposed to do nothing until then?

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:30.610
Who said anything about sitting on our hands?

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:34.410
Go meet with Jo Yoo Jeong. Check her statement thoroughly.

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.080
I don't care if it's hard on her.

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:39.920
It's better than getting blindsided in the courtroom again.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.520
All right, next. Give me Reporter Lee's phone.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.060
You brought the evidence here? Are you crazy?

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:57.270
- I wasn't thinking straight. - Hwang Hyun Jin!

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:58.540
I slept with Jun Hyeok!

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:03.710
All of my conversations with him are on that phone!

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:08.680
What's done is done. Just figure out how to stay afloat.

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:12.420
You took out the SIM right away. What's the password?

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.590
I don't know. I can't unlock it.

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:17.790
We have to unlock it somehow. It might be on here.

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:19.090
The files he was going to hand over to you.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.530
The data on that prostitution scandal.

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:25.500
- Let me take it to Dong Je. - Okay.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:27.830
Hwang Hyun Jin, seriously.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.600
Ms. Kang.

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.340
About the budget proposal that came in...

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:38.910
And something about the numbers seems off.

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.010
(Mom)

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:47.279
The person you called is unavailable.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.290
Leave a message after the tone.

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:51.860
Is this finalized? This budget won't last us all year.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.490
We have three consultations booked today alone.

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.060
Should I cancel them?

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:57.930
That won't be necessary. Proceed as planned.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.800
Yes, ma'am.

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:03.400
Mr. Kwon. Do you know where my mom is?

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.640
What's done is done, and I guess we're both in this mess.

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:10.340
So get a grip, at least from now on.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.910
I know you're upset about Reporter Lee,

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.310
but you're being way too emotional.

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:16.480
And you're not seeing too much of yourself in Yoo Jeong?

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.590
Ra Young. That's not what I meant...

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:28.160
I wish it were only with Yoo Jeong. When I look at my other clients,

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:29.660
I always see myself in them.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.100
Get it together, Hyun Jin!

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:44.480
You lose the trial. A murderer crashes the venue.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.540
I'm surprised you still have the nerve to say anything.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:51.450
Still, are you cutting our budget by 50 percent?

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:54.320
You're basically telling us to shut down LnJ.

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:56.250
Then you should have won, shouldn't you?

00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:59.290
- Mom! - That last outfit and the shoes.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.590
What are you doing? Aren't you going to change?

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:05.560
By the time I turned 42,

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:08.470
I thought I'd at least be able to wear what I want.

00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:13.240
It won't matter if you're 50 or 60. You'll still be my daughter.

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:14.970
My daughter.

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:19.280
The person who leads Haeil has to have a certain class.

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:35.460
You remember CEO Baek Tae Ju from the ceremony, don't you?

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:39.400
Their company is going to bid on the gov't smart city project.

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:41.970
And Haeil will be handling the legal advising.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.940
I'm putting together a task force. You're in charge.

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:49.610
I'm not going back to Haeil.

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:54.040
Then the budget cut stands.

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:59.080
The career you wanted for me, the marriage you wanted for me.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.790
What more do I have to do for you to finally let me go?

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:05.890
Once you take over for me, and only after that,

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:09.090
you can do what you want with LnJ. It'll be up to you.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.660
Why do you have to be the one doing that work?

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:15.600
You have Hyun Jin and Ra Young, don't you?

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:17.800
Because this is all I know.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.400
How not to end up like you.

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:22.710
Is that so?

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.440
But in the end, you'll turn out just like me.

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:29.880
Having everything I have, doing everything I've done.

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:33.980
Because that is your destiny as my daughter.

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:39.460
I hear you're thinking of taking on that murder case from yesterday.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.690
If you don't lead the task force, you'll have to drop it.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.000
Because your new budget won't even come close.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:50.500
Mark my words.

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:53.500
I have never failed to get what I want.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.140
I'm late for my appointment.

00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.380
I don't have time to give her a ride.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.210
Yes, ma'am.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.640
Are you free today?

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:09.850
I'll give you the files. I've changed my mind.

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:12.920
Reporter Lee...

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.350
raped me.

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:22.730
Ten-minute break.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:48.450
Hyun Jin.

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:13.680
- What are you doing? - Hey.

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:18.850
Honey, you know those earrings you love?

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.950
What happened to them?

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:22.650
My earrings?

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.520
Why do you ask?

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:28.260
No reason.

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:31.600
I just feel like I haven't seen them lately.

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:34.330
But what are you doing home at this hour?

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.470
I just came to grab some clothes. I won't be home for a few days.

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:40.770
You caught a case? For how many days?

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:43.240
Is five enough?

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.380
- Hyun Jin. - Yes?

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:53.080
Reporter Lee Jun Hyeok.

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:57.390
He was murdered. Last night.

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:00.560
Right.

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:05.630
Did you hear?

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:10.900
That's why I came home early.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.470
You know...

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.970
about Jun Hyeok and me.

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:25.750
I just came from the crime scene. I was pretty shaken up too.

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:31.760
What do you mean?

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:34.160
I'm telling you I just came from Lee Jun Hyeok's house.

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:35.630
Wait, so...

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.500
are you saying you're on Jun Hyeok's case?

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:44.070
Let's talk about the details later. I'll get my things. You should rest.

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:46.570
No, it's okay. I'll do it.

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:51.480
Honey, can you get me something for my headache?

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:55.010
- My head is killing me. - Okay, I got it.

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:45.260
How are you feeling?

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:50.170
I can't really tell. I've been heavily medicated.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.100
I heard you haven't been eating, either.

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:59.410
What's going to happen to me now?

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:05.319
The maximum for minors is ten years,

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.780
and that's for involuntary manslaughter.

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:10.120
If the charge is murder, the maximum is 15 years.

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:16.690
If we want to fight this, I have to know...

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:17.960
everything that happened to you that day.

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:20.030
Every single detail, from A to Z.

00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:23.700
What difference would that make?

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:30.240
Can you turn back time? To the way things were?

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.950
I don't feel like talking today.

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:53.860
You're right. You can't turn back time.

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:57.330
But we can make time move forward again.

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:02.510
Eat something.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.710
You have to eat to live, and as long as you're alive,

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:08.350
this isn't the end.

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:31.970
("Deontology")

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.480
(Do Jun)

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:44.610
- Hey, Do Jun. - The forensics report is in.

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:48.150
Jo Yoo Jeong's prints on the blade, and the blood on her clothes...

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:50.520
was confirmed to be Reporter Lee Jun Hyeok's.

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:53.490
So...

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:57.560
that means Jo Yoo Jeong was telling the truth?

00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:02.470
- Namaste. Good work, everyone. - Thank you.

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:13.940
It's been a while.

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:15.950
I was wondering where you've been.

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:20.080
I've been enjoying your show. The camera loves you too.

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:25.290
So, when are you going to take my divorce case?

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.460
- Excuse me. - It's Hong Yeon Hui.

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:31.660
I believe I already told you, divorce law isn't my specialty.

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:34.500
I could find you another attorney if you'd like.

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:36.100
And I told you.

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.800
- I only want you, Attorney Yoon. - Then I guess we're done here.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.870
Let me know if you change your mind. Anytime.

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:48.180
(Hong Yeon Hui, Head of the Forensics Lab)

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:51.180
(Dong Je)

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:54.950
I got into the phone, but...

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:57.420
What about his notes for the story? Find anything?

00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:00.490
No. Not on the cloud or the phone, but...

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.360
I think you'd better come take a look at this.

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:35.060
The files?

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.490
Nothing on his phone.

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:40.500
Given the forensics report, it's pretty clear what happened.

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:44.530
Reporter Lee raped Jo Yoo Jeong, and was killed in the process.

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.870
I get it.

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:52.379
From now on, I'll keep my feelings out of this...

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:53.840
Things have changed.

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:58.650
We're handling Jo Yoo Jeong's case. Ra Young and I.

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:01.319
Hey, Kang Shin Jae.

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:03.190
I thought Seon Kyu is handling this.

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:09.560
This is yours, isn't it?

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:14.400
We found it at Reporter Lee's house. How were you not caught?

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:16.600
I knew I'd lost it,

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:21.470
so I bought a replacement. I just didn't know where.

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:23.770
You got lucky.

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:27.110
Anyway, now you get it, right? Why you have to be off this case.

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.150
This is too risky.

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:31.680
If Seon Kyu finds out you were at Reporter Lee's house...

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:33.950
Okay. I get it.

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:37.990
So what? Should I just take a vacation?

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:42.460
Are you serious? You think the only rapist in Korea...

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:44.690
was Reporter Lee?

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:57.940
I'm sorry.

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:00.510
For the way I spoke to you.

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:05.680
You'll forgive me, right?

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:11.520
You big dummy. How could I ever be mad at you?

00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:21.430
That jerk, Lee Jun Hyeok...

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:30.610
We're not in our prime anymore, you know.

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:32.780
Come on.

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.580
- Why does this taste so weird? - It's decaf.

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:41.680
More than two cups of caffeine a day is...

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:43.490
Whatever.

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:46.689
Don't worry about Hyun Jin.

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:48.790
In a way, this is for the best. For her too.

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:52.300
How's Jo Yoo Jeong?

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:55.300
She's somewhere between despair and depression.

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:59.240
She's going to be a real handful for a while.

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:02.770
What about you? Are you okay?

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:05.880
- About what? - I saw the budget.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.040
What did she say this time? She wants you to remarry?

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:11.880
She can't force me into that so easily anymore.

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:16.720
I warned her for my next divorce, I'll be at fault...

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:17.990
and drain the entire family fortune.

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:21.160
The one and only daughter of Seong Tae Im, the CEO of Haeil...

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:23.690
How on earth are you going to lose a divorce case?

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.660
I told her I'd have a child out of wedlock.

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:32.840
- With green eyes. I like green. - That's awesome.

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:39.540
She told me to come back to Haeil.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.480
That's what my mom said.

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:44.680
That she's never one time failed to get what she wants.

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:47.080
That's true. You know what she's like.

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:52.420
But as for who her daughter is the spitting image of,

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:54.390
I guess she still hasn't figured that out.

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:57.460
Yes, that's true too.

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:04.530
The budget proposal won't pass. And handling Jo Yoo Jeong's case...

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:05.800
shouldn't be a problem either.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.370
It's not like I was worried.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:13.180
Worry about me. Just a little. Come on.

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:25.260
(Phone: Attorney Hwang Hyun Jin)

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:26.520

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:37.400
(Attorney Hwang Hyun Jin)

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.240
Hey, Gi Jeong.

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:45.680
I wanted to ask you something.

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:49.980
By any chance, do you have...

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:51.980
Jun Hyeok's laptop?

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:56.420
Stolen?

00:31:57.490 --> 00:32:00.490
I need to see you. I'll head to the office now, okay?

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:05.160
- Where are you going? - I'm just heading straight home.

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:10.300
(Jo Yoo Min)

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:14.340
Yes, Yoo Min.

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:18.270
Okay. I'll be right there.

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:21.280
Don't say a word until I get there.

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:25.110
How did you say you were stabbed again?

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:29.650
During the rape,

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:34.290
I ran to the kitchen and grabbed a knife.

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:38.760
Stay back! If you come any closer, I'll kill you!

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:43.970
But Reporter Lee grabbed me and took the knife away,

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:46.600
As I was fighting back,

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:48.710
I got stabbed.

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:52.940
So, is that when you got the bruise on your arm too?

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:56.650
- Yes. - And then?

00:32:57.210 --> 00:33:00.720
I picked up the knife that had fallen beside me,

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:04.050
and I was so scared...

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:06.320
and so angry,

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.790
that the next thing I knew,

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:15.200
there was blood everywhere.

00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:17.230
Please strike that last statement from the record.

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:20.940
- The "so scared and angry" part. - Attorney Yoon.

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:24.810
Didn't I tell you that an emotional statement could be used against you?

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:26.180
Ra Young.

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:29.580
What is going on? Why did you start the interrogation...

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:30.910
without her counsel present?

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:34.050
I think there was a miscommunication.

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:37.920
Don't you know excluding her lawyer will cause legal problems?

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:40.290
"Exclude"? Give me a break.

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:43.430
She's the one who insisted on being questioned alone.

00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:45.399
- Hey! - Sir.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.630
Since when must we tell an attorney the schedule for an interrogation...

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:49.900
- and get her permission? - Come on.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.670
- Step out. I'll handle it. - Wait.

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:59.380
We're restarting the interrogation. Yoo Jeong is a minor,

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.880
and her guardian strongly insists that I be present.

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.680
I don't need a lawyer.

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:09.990
What is wrong with you? You're the attacker, not the victim.

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:12.660
You took a life. Do you want to go to prison for life?

00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:13.920
Is that what you want?

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:18.760
Yes. I don't need one. I said I'll just go to prison.

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:22.400
I killed him. I'm the one who killed him!

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:25.230
So what more do you want from me?

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:28.100
I'll just... I'll just go to prison, okay?

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:32.040
Please, just leave me alone!

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:36.280
- Yoo Jeong. Jo Yoo Jeong, honey. - I...

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:40.550
Ma'am, please!

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:45.320
What do you mean the laptop's gone? When?

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:47.860
I don't know. It's not at Jun Hyeok's place,

00:34:47.890 --> 00:34:49.160
and it's not at the office either.

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:51.090
Did you tell the police?

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:54.130
I did, but they're just treating it like a simple theft.

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:57.730
Your firm is defending the suspect in this case, right?

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:01.670
Do you believe it? That Jun Hyeok raped that girl?

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:07.980
I pulled the building's CCTV footage because of the laptop,

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.410
and I found something really strange.

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:14.250
This was on the footage.

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:21.120
What is all this?

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:23.390
It was filmed the day before Jun Hyeok died.

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:27.500
Something just doesn't feel right. The laptop, this video,

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:28.830
and the girl's statement.

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:32.670
About the story Jun Hyeok worked on...

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:34.440
Did you hear anything, Gi Jeong?

00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:37.440
You know how private Jun Hyeok was about his work.

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:43.680
Thanks, Gi Jeong. I'll be in touch.

00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:53.919
The person you called is unavailable.

Hello.

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:22.080
- Painkillers. The strong ones. - Just a moment.

00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:28.190
Take one pill after a meal. If it's really bad, take two.

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.430
- How long does it last? - About four hours?

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.170
You can't take that many at once...

00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:43.340
The cops are cracking down hard these days.

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:47.080
I'll be toast if they find out I drove you all the way here.

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:48.910
Can we just drive in silence now?

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:54.780
She ruined the mood with clients, so her madam kicked her out.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:58.120
She's not getting much work. She was passed around some agencies.

The lawyer lady?

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:39.860
Are you sick?

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:41.960
Should we go to a hospital?

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:45.660
Just leave me alone. If you want to help, stay out of it.

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:49.130
Is this withdrawal?

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.300
What are you doing here anyway?

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:12.760
Look at this.

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:15.690
What do you think you're doing?

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:18.330
The sex trafficking scandal Jun Hyeok was chasing...

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:19.960
What exactly was it?

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:22.100
You're still on about that?

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.200
You know what it is, don't you? You know, so please tell me.

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:26.470
Was it an organization?

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:28.800
Who's involved in it?

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:31.070
I told you to ask Reporter Lee yourself.

00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:32.680
Jun Hyeok is dead.

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:36.710
What did you say?

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:39.350
A teenage girl who was one of his sources...

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:41.250
He raped her.

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:43.390
She was Kang Eun Seok's sexual assault case victim.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.690
And she's the one who killed him.

00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:49.730
The day he died, Jun Hyeok promised he'd give me his research materials.

00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:51.160
And that's when he was murdered.

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:53.960
The day before that, he was even attacked by some thugs.

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:57.170
Do you really think all of this is just a coincidence?

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:04.840
Just go.

00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:08.410
- Lee Seon Hwa. - I've nothing more to say. Just go.

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:15.480
What on earth are you pulling?

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:17.950
She's just someone I know.

00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:20.020
Please, go. Now.

00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:23.730
You haven't made a dime in days. Think you own this place, you wench?

00:40:29.730 --> 00:40:31.470
He was stabbed countless times.

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.640
He died with a knife lodged in his stomach.

00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:37.510
The Jun Hyeok you knew. Did he deserve to die like that?

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:38.910
Did he?

Hello?

00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:48.810
Look into Connect.

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:50.950
Connect?

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:54.280
Connect In. It's an app for prostitution.

00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:56.890
Ordinary people can't even get on it.

00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:59.260
They wouldn't even let someone like me in.

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:01.360
That's all I know.

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:04.590
Thank you.

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:08.860
A few months ago, Reporter Lee asked me that too.

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:13.400
I told Reporter Lee the same thing, but I didn't take any money.

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:14.670
I didn't take anything at all.

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:17.840
There can be at least one person like that in this world, right?

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:19.840
Even someone like me...

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:22.280
can help a good person for once, right?

00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:26.220
That's the kind of person Reporter Lee was.

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:30.550
Reporter Lee, a rapist?

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:32.420

You're asking me to stab your mother in the back?

00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:32.810
- It's not as bad as all that. - It's worse than that.

00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:37.990
You'd put LnJ under the foundation to break away from Haeil.

00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:41.420
That goes against your mother's goal of making you her successor.

00:48:41.490 --> 00:48:43.660
Who would dare rain on that parade?

00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:45.130
You would.

00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:51.030
Haeil is the only major law firm in the country that's family-owned.

00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:54.500
When my mom steps down, I'm going to change that system.

00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:57.070
Haeil will be incorporated,

00:48:58.010 --> 00:48:59.440
and the person to lead it then...

00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:01.540
has to be you.

00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:11.890
Why me?

00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:14.520
Because Haeil needs you more than anyone,

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:16.860
and you want Haeil more than anything.

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:27.300
And I...

00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:29.400
trust you more than I trust myself.

00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:31.940
Let go of my mother's side...

00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:35.240
and push my swing for me. Just like you used to.

00:49:39.850 --> 00:49:41.580
Your mother always used to say...

00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:45.220
she could never understand you.

00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:50.030
What do you really want, Shin Jae, if you're giving up Haeil?

00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:52.190
Obviously...

00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:54.030
what I'm already doing.

00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:14.150
Yoo Jeong could be like this for a while.

00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:18.090
The trauma from the sexual assault, the guilt of committing murder...

00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:22.060
It'll be hard for her to recover from this despair.

00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:24.590
Still,

00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:26.730
I'm not giving up on Yoo Jeong.

00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:29.360
From now on,

00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:31.030
I will be present for all questioning.

00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:33.300
Understood.

00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:36.540
To think we'd meet again on a case like this.

00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:41.540
Hyun Jin will be taken off this case.

00:50:42.010 --> 00:50:43.950
It's for the best, given the circumstances.

00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:47.350
I doubt Hyun Jin would want to anyway.

00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:51.050
Defending the person who murdered her ex-boyfriend.

00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:53.620
It's more that...

00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:58.790
she doesn't want to make things hard for her detective husband.

00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:06.300
I guess I can be petty like that.

00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:13.380
Hey, what are you doing?

00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:17.010
- We're working late again. Come on. - I'm sorry...

00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:18.680
about earlier.

00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:21.680
What? Yes. Whatever.

00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:24.850
Come on.

00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:27.690
I should get going for today.

00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:29.460
Are you heading back to the station?

00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:32.790
After we finish the search. We still haven't found his phone.

00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:36.700
Jo Yoo Jeong confessed she took it and threw it away,

00:51:36.930 --> 00:51:38.130
but it just isn't turning up.

00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:40.370
She said she threw it away?

00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:43.240
That's what Yoo Jeong told you?

00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:45.210
Yes.

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:48.180
We should get dinner with Hyun Jin sometime.

00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:52.150
Yes, Chief. Okay.

00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:15.900
You awake?

00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:26.380
Where's my sister?

00:52:27.550 --> 00:52:30.390
I sent your sister home to get you some clothes.

00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:34.560
You should go home too.

00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:37.190
And don't come back.

00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:42.660
If I have to go to prison, I'll go. I'll rot there for life if I must.

00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:44.600
I'll handle this on my own now.

00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:48.700
What did you do with Reporter Lee Jun Hyeok's cell phone?

00:52:52.170 --> 00:52:54.610
- I threw it out. - Why would you do that?

00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:58.080
- So they'd never know I killed him. - When?

00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:59.350
Right after I left.

00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:02.780
I already told the police all this.

00:53:03.490 --> 00:53:06.450
This is getting annoying. I told you to stay out of it!

00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:19.330
When you lied and said you met Kang Eun Seok at a club.

00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:23.570
You tore up your hands just like you're doing now.

00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:28.610
Then and now.

00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:30.550
Why are you lying?

00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:35.080
The person who killed Reporter Lee...

00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:36.720
wasn't you, was it?

00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:42.690
You're the one who told me to live.

00:53:44.090 --> 00:53:45.660
You told me I should keep living!

00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:47.860
So please, just go.

00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:49.860
I'm begging you, go!

00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:53.300
Detective!

00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:58.370
From this point on, I refuse to see my lawyer.

00:53:58.470 --> 00:53:59.670
We're not finished here.

00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:02.040
- Don't ever let her in here again. - Jo Yoo Jeong!

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:04.980
You'll have to leave now.

00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:09.620
Don't think this is over.

00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:11.850
I will find out why you're doing this.

00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:13.690
You can count on it.

00:54:25.870 --> 00:54:28.700
(Connect In app)

00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:30.940
(No results for "Connect In app")

00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:35.040
(No results for "Connect In app")

00:54:46.990 --> 00:54:48.460
(Ra Young)

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:50.959
- Yes? - You were right.

00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:52.060
It's not Yoo Jeong.

00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:56.330
I know. And I know who killed Jun Hyeok.

00:54:56.730 --> 00:54:57.930
Who is it?

00:54:58.530 --> 00:54:59.730
Connect.

00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:04.810
It's a secret prostitution app called Connect In.

00:55:05.570 --> 00:55:07.580
Jun Hyeok was tracking the app,

00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:12.450
and they used Yoo Jeong to kill him. To shut him up.

00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:16.080
- Connect? - I'll send you a picture. Zoom in.

00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:17.990
The statue of Nike.

00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:48.480
Stay back. Come any closer and I'll kill you!

00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:20.920
Are you going to kill me too?

00:56:23.850 --> 00:56:25.050
That's up to you.

00:56:59.750 --> 00:57:01.890
I see it. Have you told Shin Jae?

00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:24.780
(Honour)

00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:18.969
Connect is a prostitution app, right?

00:58:18.970 --> 00:58:21.040
It wasn't me.

00:58:21.570 --> 00:58:23.840
We underestimated them.

00:58:24.510 --> 00:58:27.680
Don't you think it's suspicious that everything is so clear-cut?

00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:29.810
I know someone who works for Connect.

00:58:30.210 --> 00:58:31.950
They took a DNA sample?

00:58:32.050 --> 00:58:34.720
Can you put a rush on the evidence I submitted yesterday?

00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:37.990
- This isn't a favor, it's a deal. - Don't you have a conscience?

00:58:38.250 --> 00:58:40.920
This is the ID of the first person who called 911.

00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:43.890
- It's them again. - Nothing is going to happen to you.

00:58:44.330 --> 00:58:45.530
I won't let that happen.
