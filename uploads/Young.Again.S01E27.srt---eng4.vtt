00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.400
Yusheng

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.980
Yusheng

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:03.700
No, Yusheng, sorry to bother you,

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.140
but what is going on here?

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.400
This uses your phone

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.780
to monitor your health.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.719
How much you walked in a day,

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:14.080
how many stairs you climbed,

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:15.020
what your heart rate is,

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.039
is your breathing normal,

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:17.620
when you sleep and when you wake up.

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:19.080
This...

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.719
Auntie Luo,

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:21.539
these statistics show how many hours a day

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:22.740
you spend watching the news,

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.120
let's see...

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.280
how many hours you chat,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.599
chat...

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:25.819
how many hours you scroll through videos,

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.340
what kind of videos you watch,

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.360
whether you like to comment,

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.639
whether you like to 'like' things, and so on.

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:31.139
Auntie Cai,

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:32.919
this uses facial recognition

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.180
to analyze your skeletal support,

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:36.539
ligament sagging,

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:37.960
muscle laxity,

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.280
skin tightness,

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.639
wrinkle depth,

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:41.159
and that...

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:41.979
that...

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:43.259
pore size.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.280
It knows all that?

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.860
There's nothing modern high-tech doesn't know.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.639
Dare we even use this thing?

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.199
Our privacy is completely exposed.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:54.560
Little Cai,

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:56.259
what are you doing?

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.680
I'm just looking to see

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.560
where the camera is inside this thing.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.199
When I wake up and when I sleep...

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:04.319
it knows it all! This is outrageous!

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.560
Darn it.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.240
What's wrong?

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.500
Every time I go to the toilet,

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.599
I take it with me.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.860
Me too!

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:13.120
I use it every time I take a shower

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:14.020
to play music.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.300
This won't do at all.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.120
If that's the case,

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.219
haven't we been seen by everyone?

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.939
The point is, it's filmed us completely!

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:21.580
No...

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.099
um...

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.159
Yusheng,

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.219
no, look, you...

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.379
you made us install this.

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:26.120
So...

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:27.639
what are they trying to film us doing?

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:28.599
Auntie Cai,

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:29.639
you've misunderstood.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.500
The phone uses high-tech sensor technology

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.479
to monitor your phone usage habits.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.680
Through big data

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.479
and AI,

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:38.020
it analyzes your health condition.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.659
I don't understand.

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:43.400
Anyway, you mean to say

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.139
it won't secretly film us?

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.419
It won't.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.400
If it really were secretly filming,

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.080
the government would have banned it long ago.

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:50.139
Hey,

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:50.759
Yingzi,

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:51.840
come over and help me with this.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.000
See how to work this.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.419
Uncle Liang, you've finished all these questions?

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.379
Good.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.900
This thing uses these questions

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.740
to measure your psychological age.

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.020
Then, combined with your health condition,

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.740
it calculates your Actual Age.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.080
Actual Age?

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.819
I was born in '57.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:08.840
I'm 66 this year.

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:10.199
Isn't that actual enough?

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.879
Well...

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.020
66 is your Chronological age.

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:14.860
Let's take a look at your Actual Age.

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:20.100
Uncle Liang

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.899
Your Actual Age is quite young!

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.100
Only fifty-one.

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:25.279
That's good.

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.180
I like this Actual Age.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.180
You like it, right?

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.839
Among all the seniors here, you are...

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:32.079
...the most trendy and fashionable.

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:33.040
And love to show off...

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.500
And...

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.759
And love to learn.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.540
So your mindset is young.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.100
Naturally, your Actual Age is young too.

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.819
Why is he the only young one?

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.959
Then I love to show off too.

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:43.420
Love to learn.

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:44.500
Test me too.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.139
Yusheng, come test me.

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:45.980
Who loves to learn?

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:46.639
Come on, test me.

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:47.800
This is a good thing.

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:49.000
If you have any difficult questions...

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.860
...you can ask me.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:50.480
No.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.480
We are just...

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.319
...testing our ages.

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:55.040
You two should learn from Yusheng.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.040
What?

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.040
You forgot your own ages?

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:00.100
You need a test?

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:01.660
You don't understand.

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:03.459
That age of yours...

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:04.879
...isn't your real age.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.060
So my parents tricked me?

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:09.060
The date on my ID is fake?

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:11.560
It's real.

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:13.339
But your age is fake.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.019
No.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.339
I mean, your age is real...

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.360
...but it's not your *real* age.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.160
Your real...

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.680
Did this kid take the wrong meds?

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:22.399
Did you understand what he said?

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:23.959
He means that...

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.040
...your age...

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.540
...is not your age.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.399
It's your...

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.620
It's not mine either.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.759
It's your Chronological age.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.259
Then what other age is there?

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.980
There's also Actual Age.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.720
For example...

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:36.139
...two people are both sixty-five.

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:38.420
Maybe due to health or psychological reasons...

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.000
...their Actual Ages are different.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.839
Some age prematurely.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.160
Some are old but vigorous.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.699
And some people...

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:46.360
Anyway...

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.500
...this app...

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.579
...is designed to calculate your Actual Age.

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:50.120
This...

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:51.480
You guys are simply...

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:53.300
That makes some sense.

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:54.579
What sense?

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:56.819
Pseudoscience. It's a scam.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.079
It only fools you...

00:05:58.079 --> 00:05:59.860
...old men and women who lack common sense.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.420
What?

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:02.220
I lack common sense?

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:03.319
Yes. Surprised?

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.939
Professor Fan.

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:06.620
Then let us test you.

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:08.899
Do you know what the Metaverse is?

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:10.300
What is Blockchain?

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.000
Do you know what Augmented Reality is?

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.300
VR, Mixed Reality?

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:15.439
And do you know what AI is?

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.300
What are generative large models?

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.680
Do you know what smart healthcare's...

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.420
...latest frontier is?

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:25.160
Professor Fan, do you know?

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:25.899
Do you?

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.019
Do you?

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.740
Of course I...

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:28.819
...don't know.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.439
Combining all these latest achievements...

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:34.459
...is this age-testing app.

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:35.800
Everyone.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.579
Although I don't quite understand...

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:38.439
...I know...

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.319
...this thing is unreliable.

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:41.000
Because...

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.720
Because...

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:43.220
...it goes against common sense.

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:45.720
No, ignore him.

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:48.819
Test me.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.579
What is this junk?

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.480
What is this thing?

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:01.660
Old Li

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:02.819
Who are you cursing?

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:03.480
Not a human.

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:05.339
Who are you calling "not a human"?

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.199
I didn't curse a person.

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:07.019
I'm cursing the phone.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.420
Well, that's certainly not human.

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:11.959
Why get so worked up over a machine?

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:13.420
This phone...

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.620
It insists on saying I'm over eighty.

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:17.800
That age-testing thing in here.

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:18.860
Lousy app.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.180
Didn't you say...

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:24.079
...this thing makes a lot of sense?

00:07:24.519 --> 00:07:25.600
What sense does it make?

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.279
It's all just to trick people with no common sense.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:29.759
Isn't that what I said?

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:30.519
What you said?

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.420
Can't I use your words?

00:07:33.079 --> 00:07:34.420
I've finally figured it out.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.100
They just use these concepts to scam people.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:38.620
Old Li

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.720
How did you figure that out?

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:42.160
It's obvious!

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.560
It measured me as over eighty.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.579
Isn't that just a scam?

00:07:45.379 --> 00:07:46.360
That's not necessarily true.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:46.839
What do you mean?

00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:47.699
To be honest...

00:07:48.279 --> 00:07:50.139
I think measuring you as over eighty...

00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:51.439
...actually makes some sense.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.139
Nonsense! What sense?

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.339
Because you've always been...

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.160
...flaunting your seniority...

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:55.199
...flaunting your seniority...

00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:56.100
...stuck in your ways...

00:07:56.399 --> 00:07:57.279
...refusing to make progress...

00:07:57.339 --> 00:07:58.339
...and rigid in your thinking.

00:07:58.519 --> 00:07:59.040
Shut up!

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.980
Shut up!

00:08:02.839 --> 00:08:03.899
Why don't you try it then?

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.160
Let's see how old it thinks you are.

00:08:06.439 --> 00:08:08.259
I'm not playing with this piece of junk.

00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:09.480
You don't dare, do you?

00:08:09.939 --> 00:08:10.779
Scared?

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.259
Lost your nerve?

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.600
Backing out?

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.680
Shaking?

00:08:14.899 --> 00:08:15.740
Sweating?

00:08:15.779 --> 00:08:17.399
Why would I sweat or shake?

00:08:17.439 --> 00:08:18.139
Fine, I'll test it!

00:08:18.259 --> 00:08:18.860
Who's afraid of whom?

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:19.779
Good. You test it.

00:08:20.579 --> 00:08:21.519
I want to see...

00:08:21.519 --> 00:08:22.680
...how many years younger than me you get.

00:08:26.019 --> 00:08:27.019
It's amazing.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:27.920
I'm so young.

00:08:27.959 --> 00:08:28.980
Only in my early thirties.

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:31.879
Xiao Cai, do you really believe that?

00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:33.080
Well, believe it or not.

00:08:33.139 --> 00:08:33.740
You...

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:35.259
You have to believe it, right?

00:08:35.259 --> 00:08:36.700
The facts are right there.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.080
What facts?

00:08:38.379 --> 00:08:39.639
The fact that I'm young.

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:42.159
It's set in stone, isn't it?

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:42.740
For example...

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:43.179
Take you...

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:44.080
That...

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.320
You don't like watching cartoons.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:45.580
Right.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.919
"Scrubby and the Gray Duck."

00:08:47.039 --> 00:08:48.299
You don't like them, but I do.

00:08:48.379 --> 00:08:49.100
And there's that...

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:49.740
That...

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.019
"Mai Mao Won't Grow Tall."

00:08:51.019 --> 00:08:52.340
"Looks Like a Shorty."

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.019
Don't you believe me?

00:08:53.019 --> 00:08:54.200
I believe it.

00:08:54.279 --> 00:08:54.779
And also...

00:08:54.919 --> 00:08:56.000
I'm telling you, even now...

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.100
I don't dare tap the bowl with my chopsticks.

00:08:58.299 --> 00:08:59.679
I'm terrified I'll become...

00:08:59.679 --> 00:09:00.740
A beggar begging for food.

00:09:01.379 --> 00:09:03.399
That just proves you're childish and haven't grown up.

00:09:03.539 --> 00:09:04.480
How am I...

00:09:05.139 --> 00:09:06.740
Being childish is exactly the point!

00:09:06.799 --> 00:09:08.340
Being childish shows that I'm young!

00:09:08.399 --> 00:09:10.080
Then you really haven't grown up.

00:09:11.059 --> 00:09:11.759
How so?

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.100
Look here.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:14.799
Okay.

00:09:15.659 --> 00:09:16.379
The test is done.

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.299
How did it go?

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.240
What's the Actual Age result?

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.419
This result...

00:09:21.419 --> 00:09:22.679
I'm too embarrassed to say.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.320
What's there to be embarrassed about?

00:09:24.899 --> 00:09:26.159
We're in the same boat.

00:09:27.779 --> 00:09:28.700
Thirty-one.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:29.940
Sorry about that.

00:09:30.159 --> 00:09:31.340
A bit too young, huh?

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:33.740
It's inaccurate.

00:09:34.639 --> 00:09:35.299
This app...

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.500
It's just not fair.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.279
Boss Li...

00:09:40.759 --> 00:09:42.600
Do you know what the Metaverse is?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.519
Or what Blockchain is?

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:45.840
What is Augmented Reality?

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.000
Virtual Reality, Mixed Reality?

00:09:47.659 --> 00:09:48.740
What is AI?

00:09:49.259 --> 00:09:50.940
What are Generative Large Models?

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:52.740
Do you know what...

00:09:53.799 --> 00:09:56.019
...the latest frontier in smart healthcare is?

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.000
How would I...

00:09:59.019 --> 00:09:59.580
...know that?

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:02.480
I just know this isn't reliable.

00:10:02.919 --> 00:10:04.419
That's what I'm saying.

00:10:09.899 --> 00:10:11.100
It's so good to be young.

00:10:20.299 --> 00:10:22.100
Who is this? You look so familiar.

00:10:22.379 --> 00:10:24.220
What's wrong? Can't recognize me?

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.379
Miss, you've got the wrong place.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.820
This is a retirement community.

00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:30.480
A retirement community.

00:10:30.559 --> 00:10:33.139
That doesn't mean you can discriminate against us young...

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:34.659
...elderly people.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:36.980
You are a typical case of...

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:38.480
...an old cucumber painted green.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.139
Acting young.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.259
Is this my Auntie Cai?

00:10:42.259 --> 00:10:44.279
You look so young today.

00:10:45.659 --> 00:10:46.440
Auntie Cai.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.740
Your outfit is way too shocking...

00:10:49.379 --> 00:10:50.799
...way too beautiful!

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.759
Really beautiful.

00:10:52.759 --> 00:10:55.100
This app can really rejuvenate people.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.100
Here comes another green-painted one.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:01.720
Professor Fan.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.539
You look totally handsome and cool today.

00:11:04.559 --> 00:11:06.259
Simply beyond compare.

00:11:07.179 --> 00:11:08.320
Is this really the Professor?

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.159
I thought four new college students arrived.

00:11:10.299 --> 00:11:11.279
Thank you.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.700
Pity the one in the middle...

00:11:12.779 --> 00:11:13.799
...is a student held back a year.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:18.580
Son!

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000
You're back.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:21.179
Come here, quick.

00:11:21.659 --> 00:11:22.700
Let Dad have a look.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:23.460
He's calling you.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.500
When did I become a son?

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:25.200
You aren't.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.340
Who told you to dress up so young and pretty?

00:11:28.779 --> 00:11:29.659
Hurry over there.

00:11:29.659 --> 00:11:30.840
This is the price for acting young.

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:31.799
Zhu Zhu, help me out.

00:11:31.899 --> 00:11:32.700
Help me fool him for a bit.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:33.259
Quick.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.100
He even has a grandson.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:39.759
Okay.

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:40.179
Quick.

00:11:40.179 --> 00:11:41.639
Let Grandpa have a look.

00:11:42.179 --> 00:11:43.860
Um, Grandpa...

00:11:43.919 --> 00:11:45.299
It's time for our medicine.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.379
Come on, let's go take our meds.

00:11:46.379 --> 00:11:46.820
Let's go.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:48.159
Okay.

00:11:48.679 --> 00:11:49.139
Okay.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:50.120
Okay.

00:11:52.279 --> 00:11:53.200
Grandson.

00:11:55.139 --> 00:11:57.039
The grandson is much more filial than you.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.080
Let's go.

00:11:58.159 --> 00:11:59.639
Grandpa will take you to eat something good.

00:12:00.039 --> 00:12:00.440
Let's go.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:01.399
Eat something good.

00:12:02.399 --> 00:12:03.059
Son.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:05.620
What are you laughing at?

00:12:05.639 --> 00:12:06.860
Stop laughing!

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:07.879
What do you mean?

00:12:08.379 --> 00:12:09.899
Is being young a crime?

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.179
Exactly.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.679
You're jealous of us young people.

00:12:14.759 --> 00:12:15.440
So annoying.

00:12:25.659 --> 00:12:26.399
Boss Li

00:12:27.899 --> 00:12:29.200
Am I really that old?

00:12:29.559 --> 00:12:30.259
Not at all.

00:12:30.779 --> 00:12:31.820
The test results say

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:33.460
you're five years younger than me.

00:12:34.899 --> 00:12:35.980
That just proves you're old.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:37.940
It doesn't prove I'm young.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.460
Being old has its perks.

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:45.440
As the old saying goes...

00:12:46.299 --> 00:12:47.759
"Money can't buy a slim figure in old age."

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.799
That just means being thin is good.

00:12:51.519 --> 00:12:52.879
Another saying goes...

00:12:53.559 --> 00:12:54.620
"Old ginger is spicier."

00:12:54.799 --> 00:12:55.980
"Wine gets better with age."

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.899
That just means ginger and wine are good.

00:12:59.399 --> 00:13:00.679
And another saying goes...

00:13:00.799 --> 00:13:01.980
"Old trees sprout new buds."

00:13:02.019 --> 00:13:02.899
"Old cows eat tender..."

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.259
What are you saying?

00:13:04.799 --> 00:13:05.580
That's not right.

00:13:07.399 --> 00:13:08.720
"An old veteran is worth two."

00:13:08.799 --> 00:13:10.379
"The old warhorse still dreams of glory."

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:11.320
Did I get it right this time?

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.559
Not bad. You got two right.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.419
It may be right,

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.639
but what if I still want to be young?

00:13:19.639 --> 00:13:20.379
That's easy.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:21.919
If you want to be young,

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:22.679
Ms. Liu,

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.500
hang out with us young people more!

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.000
Right?

00:13:25.019 --> 00:13:27.120
If you keep hanging around an eighty-year-old,

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.960
you'll only feel yourself getting older.

00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:30.139
But suppose,

00:13:30.139 --> 00:13:31.679
you hang out with a thirty-one-year-old...

00:13:31.799 --> 00:13:32.340
...together.

00:13:32.399 --> 00:13:33.639
That would be a mother-son bond.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:34.120
Right.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:35.299
No, wait.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.039
What mother-son bond?

00:13:37.159 --> 00:13:37.679
At least...

00:13:37.679 --> 00:13:38.320
A May-December romance.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:39.860
That's not right either.

00:13:41.059 --> 00:13:41.620
Brother and sister?

00:13:42.179 --> 00:13:43.120
No, that's not it.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.940
You're really something, Old Fan.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.639
Give you an inch and you take a mile.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.320
Call you a fool and you start drooling.

00:13:48.419 --> 00:13:50.240
It's one thing to pretend in front of me,

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.399
but why act young in front of Ms. Liu?

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:53.899
Do you admit your mistake?

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.360
Do you admit your guilt?

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:55.580
I...

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:56.120
I admit...

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:58.559
I admit I'm forever young!

00:13:58.559 --> 00:14:00.279
Is it a crime to be young at heart?

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.360
Still pretending?

00:14:02.019 --> 00:14:02.600
Ms. Liu,

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.679
deep down in his heart,

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.059
he thinks of you as an auntie.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:07.080
No, Ms. Liu!

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.580
I don't think of you as an auntie, really!

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.200
So, were you wrong or not?

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:10.700
Fine.

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:11.539
I was wrong.

00:14:11.539 --> 00:14:12.019
Happy now?

00:14:12.919 --> 00:14:13.559
That's better.

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.519
Since you've admitted your mistake nicely,

00:14:16.279 --> 00:14:16.860
you can go.

00:14:18.279 --> 00:14:19.759
Why should I go?

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.620
Ms. Liu and I are peers.

00:14:22.799 --> 00:14:23.779
Adults are talking.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.200
You're just a young whippersnapper.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:25.940
Go play outside.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:26.940
Come back when you're grown up.

00:14:27.159 --> 00:14:27.399
Go.

00:14:27.399 --> 00:14:27.779
But... you...

00:14:27.779 --> 00:14:28.080
Go.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:28.799
But you...

00:14:28.799 --> 00:14:29.120
Shoo.

00:14:29.179 --> 00:14:29.580
You...

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.120
Shoo.

00:14:32.559 --> 00:14:33.259
So immature.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:37.879
Once a person gets on in years

00:14:37.879 --> 00:14:38.960
Everything goes in reverse

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.639
You can't sleep when lying down

00:14:40.639 --> 00:14:41.720
But you doze off when sitting up

00:14:42.059 --> 00:14:43.559
Things that just happened

00:14:43.639 --> 00:14:44.519
You forget the moment you turn your head

00:14:44.519 --> 00:14:45.000
True

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.659
But things from ages ago

00:14:46.659 --> 00:14:48.340
You remember crystal clear

00:14:49.279 --> 00:14:50.039
Take this, for example

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.000
You can't see clearly up close

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.340
But look from afar

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:54.100
It's super sharp

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.679
Speaking of memory

00:14:56.679 --> 00:14:58.120
I know exactly what you mean

00:14:58.419 --> 00:14:59.460
Yesterday

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.879
I actually ate dinner twice

00:15:02.299 --> 00:15:03.740
Were you really hungry?

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.240
No

00:15:05.779 --> 00:15:07.500
I came back from a dinner party

00:15:07.919 --> 00:15:08.620
And I just

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:10.200
Just forgot about it

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.460
As soon as I heard the cafeteria was serving

00:15:12.519 --> 00:15:14.000
I ate another meal

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.620
My stomach felt so awful

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.080
Don't even mention it

00:15:18.139 --> 00:15:19.159
Then I realized

00:15:19.679 --> 00:15:21.299
It turns out I ate two meals

00:15:21.399 --> 00:15:22.779
You've got it easy

00:15:23.139 --> 00:15:25.240
I've used chopsticks my whole life

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.000
But now

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:26.759
I can't anymore

00:15:27.019 --> 00:15:28.419
The chopsticks get to my mouth

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.879
And before I even open it

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.240
I let go of the chopsticks

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.460
Both the food and the soup

00:15:33.519 --> 00:15:35.039
Get eaten by my clothes

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.299
Look at this

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.220
Go get changed

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:38.179
Hello, everyone

00:15:38.899 --> 00:15:40.360
What are you chatting about?

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.039
What are we chatting about?

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.580
With a young person like you

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:44.720
You wouldn't understand

00:15:45.259 --> 00:15:46.340
Don't say that

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.980
I'm just young at heart

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.580
You dress very young too

00:15:51.799 --> 00:15:54.179
If it weren't for those wrinkles on your face

00:15:54.179 --> 00:15:54.580
Pfft

00:15:55.659 --> 00:15:57.620
You'd be a total Barbie doll

00:15:58.460 --> 00:15:59.039
Miss Cai

00:15:59.039 --> 00:15:59.960
Someone like you

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.659
At the blooming age of thirty-something

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.940
Why not find a partner and settle down?

00:16:04.019 --> 00:16:05.519
Why hang around with us bunch of

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.700
Old men and women?

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.139
Right

00:16:08.159 --> 00:16:09.500
What kind do you like?

00:16:09.559 --> 00:16:10.179
Big Sister here

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:11.139
No

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:12.879
Auntie here

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.220
Will keep an eye out for you

00:16:14.539 --> 00:16:15.820
Oh, give it a rest

00:16:15.919 --> 00:16:17.000
The ones you find

00:16:17.039 --> 00:16:18.519
Would Miss Cai even look at them?

00:16:18.919 --> 00:16:20.559
A fair lady

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.019
Is a gentleman's desire

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:23.740
She has to find a

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.700
Successful, talented young man

00:16:26.259 --> 00:16:27.679
What are you saying?

00:16:27.679 --> 00:16:28.799
You're making fun of me, aren't you?

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:30.440
I'm not talking to you anymore

00:16:30.679 --> 00:16:31.980
We have nothing in common

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.539
Hey

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.259
Professor Fan

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.379
Why torture yourself?

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.019
What are you doing?

00:16:52.019 --> 00:16:52.500
Let go, quick!

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:53.299
Let go!

00:16:53.399 --> 00:16:54.820
I can't let go!

00:16:55.059 --> 00:16:56.419
Although we are young...

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.039
...and discriminated against by them...

00:16:58.159 --> 00:16:58.799
...but...

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.960
...you shouldn't take it so hard.

00:17:01.019 --> 00:17:02.019
Let go of me, quick!

00:17:02.019 --> 00:17:03.500
Are you trying to push me in?

00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:09.500
I'm not taking it hard!

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:11.980
This water is too shallow to drown anyone!

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:12.940
But what if...

00:17:13.019 --> 00:17:14.039
...you fall in sideways...

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:15.240
...that water...

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:17.140
Why would I go in there?

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:18.240
I'm living a good life.

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:20.240
Although...

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:21.640
...we are discriminated against by them...

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:23.460
...but it is a happy kind of pain.

00:17:23.519 --> 00:17:23.960
Do you understand?

00:17:24.539 --> 00:17:26.279
Pain can be happy?

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:27.119
Sure.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:28.759
Painful happiness.

00:17:28.839 --> 00:17:29.859
In short, a thrill.

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:31.680
Is that a saying?

00:17:33.519 --> 00:17:34.480
It's fine.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.700
Since they won't play with us...

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.140
...let's go find our peers to play with.

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:40.660
Let's go find college students.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:41.140
Right.

00:17:41.259 --> 00:17:41.880
Let's go play.

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:42.339
Let's go.

00:17:48.619 --> 00:17:49.279
What should we play?

00:17:49.339 --> 00:17:50.319
What shall we play?

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:51.119
What to play...

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:51.740
Play what?

00:17:51.819 --> 00:17:52.359
What?

00:17:52.519 --> 00:17:53.019
Wha...

00:17:53.359 --> 00:17:54.819
How should I know?

00:17:55.359 --> 00:17:56.500
You're the professor.

00:17:56.779 --> 00:17:57.480
It's up to you.

00:17:59.259 --> 00:18:00.519
You young people...

00:18:00.599 --> 00:18:01.960
...what do you usually like to play?

00:18:02.259 --> 00:18:02.920
Eating chicken.

00:18:04.099 --> 00:18:04.779
Eating chicken?

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:05.839
No problem.

00:18:06.059 --> 00:18:07.019
It's my treat today.

00:18:07.299 --> 00:18:08.200
Roast chicken, smoked chicken...

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:08.940
...or braised chicken?

00:18:09.799 --> 00:18:10.920
The Professor is paying.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.200
I'll run and buy it for you.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:13.700
Auntie Cai, no.

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:15.740
It's not really eating chicken.

00:18:16.299 --> 00:18:17.240
It's fake?

00:18:17.259 --> 00:18:18.579
Pretending to eat chicken?

00:18:18.859 --> 00:18:20.339
No, Auntie Cai.

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.240
"Eating Chicken" is an online game.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:22.799
Because...

00:18:22.799 --> 00:18:24.599
...at the end of the game, there's a phrase...

00:18:24.599 --> 00:18:26.380
"Winner winner, chicken dinner."

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:28.500
So everyone calls it the "Chicken Game."

00:18:29.819 --> 00:18:30.720
I get it.

00:18:31.259 --> 00:18:32.240
Isn't it just playing games?

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:33.480
We'll learn it too.

00:18:34.099 --> 00:18:35.420
An elder who can't play games...

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:36.380
...is not a good professor.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.299
Is that how the saying goes?

00:18:38.299 --> 00:18:38.940
Yes.

00:18:39.019 --> 00:18:40.160
You learn fast.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:41.619
That's right.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.200
That sentence of yours was...

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.779
"A professor who doesn't beat old people isn't a good game."

00:18:46.319 --> 00:18:47.000
Nonsense.

00:18:47.299 --> 00:18:48.500
Not beating old people professors.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:49.579
It's playing games.

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.160
I'm confused.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.220
We should learn too.

00:18:52.299 --> 00:18:53.180
You guys teach us.

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:53.839
How to play, okay?

00:18:53.839 --> 00:18:54.519
Right, okay.

00:18:55.019 --> 00:18:55.599
First...

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.140
...you need to give yourself a cool...

00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:59.720
...domineering, and unique name.

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:01.059
Like mine...

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:02.420
...mine is called...

00:19:02.519 --> 00:19:03.619
"Naturally Dazed and Cute."

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.240
You're not dazed at all, really.

00:19:06.299 --> 00:19:07.539
Keke, what's yours?

00:19:07.559 --> 00:19:08.539
My name?

00:19:08.619 --> 00:19:09.380
I'm called...

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.759
"Looking Up At Your Distance."

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.960
Very artsy, quite artsy.

00:19:15.259 --> 00:19:15.960
What about Yingzi?

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.519
I'm "Silly Little Egg."

00:19:18.339 --> 00:19:19.799
Why are you all so modest?

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:21.279
Xiaoxin.

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:22.319
Me.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:24.859
My name is

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:26.900
Sis is Tall and Proud

00:19:27.839 --> 00:19:29.400
That's so not you

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.980
You make up for what you lack

00:19:31.039 --> 00:19:33.039
Tell everyone yours

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:33.500
Right

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.380
Me

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:35.779
I won't say it

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.559
Wang Song, let's hear yours

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.779
Let Me Tell You Slowly

00:19:40.099 --> 00:19:40.660
Okay

00:19:40.859 --> 00:19:41.920
Speak slowly, no rush

00:19:42.799 --> 00:19:44.140
My screen name is

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.099
Let Me Tell You Slowly

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:47.759
This screen name...

00:19:47.759 --> 00:19:48.240
It's so awkward

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.819
Now it's your turn to pick names

00:19:50.359 --> 00:19:50.980
Okay

00:19:51.059 --> 00:19:52.900
We don't know how to pick names

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:53.759
How about

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.359
you pick names for us

00:19:55.359 --> 00:19:55.799
Right

00:19:55.799 --> 00:19:56.440
Auntie Cai

00:19:56.539 --> 00:19:58.240
You should just call yourself Cabbage

00:19:58.299 --> 00:19:59.000
Why?

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.180
It means that

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.400
although you're very competitive,

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.599
your skills are weak.

00:20:02.599 --> 00:20:03.859
And your surname happens to be Cai.

00:20:04.359 --> 00:20:06.539
Just because my name is Cai means I'm weak?

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:07.900
Not necessarily

00:20:08.299 --> 00:20:08.920
How about this

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:11.140
I'll give you a more domineering name

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:12.480
It's called

00:20:13.099 --> 00:20:15.019
Sprinting Toward Hell

00:20:15.099 --> 00:20:16.440
Why would I run there?

00:20:16.599 --> 00:20:17.019
I'm not going

00:20:17.019 --> 00:20:17.720
Not going

00:20:17.859 --> 00:20:21.500
Then how about Heart-Tearing Without Lung-Splitting

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.500
That makes me sound too miserable

00:20:23.839 --> 00:20:24.759
Or else call it

00:20:25.119 --> 00:20:26.500
You Are Not Allowed To Reject Me

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:28.299
That's not great either

00:20:28.299 --> 00:20:29.240
But it's slightly better

00:20:29.259 --> 00:20:30.180
I'll use this for now

00:20:30.259 --> 00:20:31.819
Pick one for the Professor

00:20:32.519 --> 00:20:34.119
The Professor's surname is good

00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:36.440
Any name sounds good with it

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:38.099
Rice Pot

00:20:38.839 --> 00:20:39.599
Rice Bowl

00:20:39.599 --> 00:20:40.079
You...

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:40.920
Rice Spoon

00:20:41.099 --> 00:20:42.000
Rice Basin

00:20:43.119 --> 00:20:44.519
You call that sounding good?

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.099
Why not just call me Rice Bucket?

00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:48.000
Rice Bucket works

00:20:51.839 --> 00:20:52.859
Why are they so happy about this?

00:20:52.859 --> 00:20:53.859
Yeah, is it that funny?

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:54.940
We can't play along with them

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:55.640
Let's go

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:03.779
This... this...

00:21:03.779 --> 00:21:04.039
This, I...

00:21:04.039 --> 00:21:04.740
Just now you...

00:21:06.019 --> 00:21:06.759
Professor Fan

00:21:07.299 --> 00:21:09.039
Why aren't you acting young today?

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:11.079
Don't mention it

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:12.799
My test result was wrong

00:21:13.019 --> 00:21:14.079
How could it be wrong?

00:21:14.359 --> 00:21:15.900
Wasn't it the sweet age of thirty-one?

00:21:16.339 --> 00:21:17.319
My fault

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.759
I filled it out wrong

00:21:19.059 --> 00:21:20.140
It's because of my old age

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:21.859
The brain isn't sharp

00:21:22.019 --> 00:21:23.000
I got confused

00:21:23.079 --> 00:21:24.119
and filled it out wrong

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.019
That's not right

00:21:25.539 --> 00:21:26.700
Haven't you always said

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:27.779
that compared to young guys

00:21:27.779 --> 00:21:28.799
you're not any worse?

00:21:29.079 --> 00:21:30.339
How did you get confused?

00:21:31.559 --> 00:21:32.039
Yes

00:21:32.039 --> 00:21:34.099
I really lacked self-awareness

00:21:35.099 --> 00:21:36.279
Something's wrong

00:21:37.099 --> 00:21:39.460
Why is Professor Fan so humble today?

00:21:40.019 --> 00:21:41.420
It makes me uncomfortable

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:43.420
Did his brain get a shock?

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:44.480
No

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:46.740
If I make a mistake, I correct it

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:48.319
I hope everyone can forgive me

00:21:48.319 --> 00:21:48.859
Alright

00:21:52.299 --> 00:21:53.019
Xiao Cai

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:54.779
Why did you change back too?

00:21:54.779 --> 00:21:56.339
Are you here to admit your mistake too?

00:21:56.599 --> 00:21:57.180
Change what?

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:58.259
Admit what mistake?

00:21:58.519 --> 00:22:00.420
My son and daughter-in-law are coming over soon.

00:22:00.599 --> 00:22:02.259
I can't look younger than my daughter-in-law.

00:22:02.259 --> 00:22:03.319
And end up calling her "sister-in-law".

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:06.460
I'll dress old for now.

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:07.720
What about after they leave?

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:08.460
Don't.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.920
You absolutely cannot change back.

00:22:11.599 --> 00:22:13.240
While she was playing young...

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:14.640
Whenever she put on makeup...

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.779
She'd occupy the bathroom and never come out.

00:22:17.299 --> 00:22:17.900
It forced me to...

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.859
Go to Grandma Jin's bathroom every day.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.019
It won't happen again.

00:22:22.019 --> 00:22:22.779
I won't act... won't go back to that.

00:22:22.779 --> 00:22:23.680
Everyone.

00:22:23.779 --> 00:22:24.259
Everyone.

00:22:24.759 --> 00:22:26.099
I have good news for everyone.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.200
Hold on a second.

00:22:27.579 --> 00:22:29.640
What do you want us to test this time?

00:22:29.799 --> 00:22:31.859
That age-testing app from last time...

00:22:32.019 --> 00:22:33.220
Based on user feedback...

00:22:33.299 --> 00:22:34.759
According to the World Age Organization...

00:22:34.799 --> 00:22:36.099
And their latest published standards...

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.940
Combined with gene remote sensing technology...

00:22:38.079 --> 00:22:40.000
It fixed the bugs in the original technology.

00:22:40.579 --> 00:22:42.019
There were bugs, right?

00:22:42.099 --> 00:22:43.220
Look at that.

00:22:43.259 --> 00:22:45.019
See, I told you so.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.900
That test definitely had issues.

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.960
Otherwise, I couldn't possibly be that old.

00:22:49.359 --> 00:22:50.940
So, do you elders want to try again?

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:51.940
With this new app?

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:52.960
I'm not testing.

00:22:53.039 --> 00:22:54.380
Isn't that just asking for trouble?

00:22:54.579 --> 00:22:55.680
Exactly.

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.920
I'm already this young.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.039
Why would I need to test?

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.539
It'd be a hassle if it says I'm 18.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.099
I'll try.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.000
I want to try.

00:23:03.019 --> 00:23:03.460
Come on.

00:23:03.519 --> 00:23:05.220
Just update it on your phone.

00:23:05.259 --> 00:23:05.680
Okay.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:06.440
I want to try too.

00:23:06.579 --> 00:23:07.019
You...

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.720
I'm so happy today.

00:23:11.059 --> 00:23:12.440
Today's result is just right.

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:13.759
You're 48.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:14.839
I'm 50.

00:23:15.039 --> 00:23:16.099
Just right.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:16.599
Right.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:19.440
What do you mean "just right"?

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:20.799
Exactly.

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.680
Our measured Actual Age and Chronological age...

00:23:23.839 --> 00:23:24.599
Match perfectly.

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:28.700
That's how it is.

00:23:30.099 --> 00:23:31.019
No other meaning.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:32.180
No.

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:33.279
If there was...

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.119
I'd still say no.

00:23:37.819 --> 00:23:40.039
You two are finally younger than all of us.

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:42.259
You are now...

00:23:42.259 --> 00:23:44.500
The juniors of our retirement community.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.819
So from now on, the heavy lifting...

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:47.839
Is all up to you.

00:23:48.059 --> 00:23:48.920
Don't do that.

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.299
Don't treat us as that young.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.660
If there's real heavy lifting...

00:23:52.759 --> 00:23:53.220
It still has to be...

00:23:53.279 --> 00:23:54.819
Yusheng and those young people.

00:23:55.059 --> 00:23:56.140
Speaking of you.

00:23:56.359 --> 00:23:58.500
What's wrong? Why the long faces?

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.380
I have a good...

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.200
...really unfortunate piece of news.

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:04.880
We also took that age test.

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:06.240
What was the result?

00:24:06.619 --> 00:24:08.180
Our ages...

00:24:08.339 --> 00:24:09.819
Are older than all of yours.
