Ying Du.

Che,

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.150
what brings you here?

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.960
I just wanted to see

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.970
if your injury is serious.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.510
I'm really fine.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.230
I'm really fine.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.870
Che,

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.960
I have urgent business.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.850
I'll be leaving now.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.790
Zhaoli,

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.680
I've been back for days.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.630
Why have you been avoiding me?

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.030
I...

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.800
As you know,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.750
you're different to me.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.680
We once made a promise

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.190
to get married when we grew up.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.430
You were to be my bride.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.710
Che,

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.190
that was just childhood talk.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.570
You can't take that seriously.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.150
Back then, we didn't understand

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.150
how it feels to love someone.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.030
So,

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.520
I'm sorry, Che.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.920
I don't believe there's no place
for me in your heart.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.560
Have your people never told you

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.280
I'm Zhaoli's husband?

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.030
If you keep pestering Zhaoli,

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.400
saying she's your bride,

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.360
this warning will be the least
of your worries.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.710
(Ying Du's power has clearly waned.)

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.000
(How did his injuries heal so quickly?)

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.030
(Could it be)

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.120
(because he's been with Wu Zhaoli?)

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.520
Ying Du,

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.960
I can handle it myself.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:32.810
The old wounds haven't healed,

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:33.970
and now there are new ones.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.150
You get hurt too easily;

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.660
I can't keep protecting you like this.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.090
No wonder you agreed to my deal
without hesitation yesterday.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.970
It seems

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.800
I've made a losing bargain.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:48.710
Ying Du,

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.280
the man I saw in my dream

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.080
was you,

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.240
wasn't it?

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.200
What do you mean?

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.920
I said

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.870
the one I saw in my dream

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.750
was you.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.000
See? It hasn't changed at all.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.800
I'm not the one from your dream.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.270
How could that be?

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.800
I saw your face on him.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.950
Now that you know I'm not him,

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.800
are you disappointed?

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.400
I...

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.800
I don't know.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.560
It's all right.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.600
Someday, you'll find out who he is.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.830
I'll help you look for him.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.600
The man Zhaoli's been seeing
is shameless.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.680
He locked me up in the chicken coop!

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.240
These chickens kept me busy
for two days.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.310
Help!

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.190
Help me!

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.920
Help!

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:13.800
Wu Luoluo?

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.950
I've been looking for you for two days.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.720
I didn't expect to find you here.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.120
Your Highness,

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.480
I followed your orders exactly.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.070
But her lover got in the way.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.310
You wouldn't blame me, right?

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.600
Since it's unfinished,

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.600
keep working for me.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.680
If you fail this time,

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.360
you know the consequences.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.190
I am Oracle,

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.350
(Oracle)
well-versed in the past and present.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.000
There's nothing I don't know.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:51.730
Zhaoli,

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.800
you're here again.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.040
Are you here to interpret a dream

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.240
or to keep asking about the Bracelet?

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.080
Oracle,

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.750
could the person
confirmed by the Bracelet

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.630
be mistaken?

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.600
Is there any chance

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.800
that the Bracelet made an error?

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.360
Absolutely impossible.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.070
Sachets! Pouches!

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.040
Come and take a look!

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.010
Miss,

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.070
anything you fancy?

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.390
(The man in my dream isn't Ying Du.)

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.240
(Why does my heart feel so hollow?)

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.270
(She's so obsessed
with finding that man.)

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.960
(I should've said)

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.870
(that the man in her dream was me.)

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.200
(Otherwise,)

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.270
(if she finds that man,)

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.630
(would there be no place for me?)

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:40.400
Miss, have a look.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.510
Miss, take a glance.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.430
Sorry, are you alright?

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.600
My belly...

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.510
I think the baby is coming.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:55.230
I beg you.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.800
Please save my child and me.

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.190
I may be a healer,

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.530
but I've never delivered a baby.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:01.470
From the looks of this,

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:02.740
if the child doesn't come soon,

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.620
both the mother and the child
will be in peril.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:05.800
Please, help her.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.040
I'm begging you.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.120
Please, save me.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.360
Then come with me.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:13.150
Watch your step.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.420
Let's head over there.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.510
May I borrow your umbrella?

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.360
Go find the nearest midwife.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.040
I'll ease her pain first.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.160
You must hurry.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:24.150
Alright.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.160
Careful.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.000
Come on.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.630
We'll make do here for now.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.920
The midwife will be here soon.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.390
You're not pregnant.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.950
Wu Luoluo?

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.950
Was last time's lesson not enough?

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:09.920
You're working together.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.310
From the looks of this,

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:15.510
if the child doesn't come soon,

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.750
both mother and child will be in peril.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:18.920
Then come with me.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:24.350
Something's off.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.440
Here you are, sir.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.400
Got it.
