[Born to Be Alive]

[Episode 27]

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.500
Even the police can't find him,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.600
what makes you think you can?

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.090
What?

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.190
Do I have to open it for you?

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.160
Back in the Mountain Patrol,

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.030
you guys always kept an eye on me

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.770
and wouldn't let me drink.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.750
Drink up.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.690
Now no one's there to nag you anymore.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.600
That's right.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.930
Now no one's there to nag me anymore.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.370
No one...

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.620
You haven't even started drinking.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.680
Why are you crying?

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.700
No one's there to nag me anymore.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:03.430
Mr. Feng.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.130
Meng,

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:06.880
you're just in time.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.120
Liao from Chenlong Coal Mine

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.070
sent over a set of clubs.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.460
Take them and have fun.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:13.690
Thank you.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.600
But golf...

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.089
I don't know how to play it.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.050
It's mostly about taking a walk.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:19.920
Don't just

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.360
sit in the office all the time.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.960
Get out and move around more.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:24.300
Here.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:25.730
Have some tea.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.640
Liao is still so stingy.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.830
He didn't even

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.300
pick a good brand.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.540
I think

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.750
we should knock
another twenty million off

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.680
the final price for Chenlong Mine.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.530
For a small matter like this,

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.390
you two can just decide
between yourselves.

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:48.300
Mr. Feng,

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.010
I've contacted

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.270
those mine owners.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.810
They are the ones in a rush now.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.680
They've shut down production

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.659
but still have to keep paying the workers.

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:58.690
They're all begging

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.620
to sign the contract with us
as soon as possible.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.420
Really?

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.810
I heard Dajin Coal Mine

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:04.920
is still sticking to 500 million

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.850
and won't budge.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.090
Some of them are
trying to jack up the price.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.560
But I've looked into it.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.300
They don't have any backing.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.860
If they dare to act tough with me again,

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:16.770
I have plenty of ways

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.160
to shut them up.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.270
What kind of ways?

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.940
Blocking the gate?

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.370
Cutting off water and power?

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.830
Or just beating people up?

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:27.560
Wu.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:29.980
It's not ten years ago anymore.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.450
Vice Mayor Lin's secretary

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:32.450
called me just now

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.690
and specifically emphasized the need

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.550
for the consolidation
to comply with regulations.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.720
Don't get it?

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.750
He's warning us

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:42.600
that at a time like this,

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.980
do not cause trouble.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.190
Vice Mayor Lin?

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:49.210
With Mr. Feng's

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.940
relationship with Mayor Wang,

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.840
why are you

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:52.330
afraid of him, a Vice Mayor?

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.790
If you two keep bickering,

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.750
I'm going back to my island.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.080
I just told you.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.560
For a small matter like this,

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.510
you two can just decide
between yourselves.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.370
Don't bother me with everything.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:05.630
Yes, sir.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.530
Understood.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.330
I read your report.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.290
It was very good.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.830
Just now, I even praised you

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.100
in front of Mayor Wang.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.030
What are your thoughts

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.760
after this inspection trip?

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.920
If there is anything else

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.870
you need the city government

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:19.890
to help with,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:20.930
just ask.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.240
Then, I won't beat around the bush

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.040
with you.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.650
When have you ever

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.380
beaten around the bush with me?

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:29.390
Just say it.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.930
My previous report

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.470
was initially coordinated

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:34.890
by the Tianduo Coal Bureau.

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:35.480
They wanted

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.360
to use an undercover media investigation

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.480
to break the deadlock,

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.659
then team up with workplace safety,

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:39.310
environmental,

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.130
industry and commerce,

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.150
and land resources authorities

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.360
to carry out a major crackdown

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.020
on Tianduo's coal companies.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:45.560
But later on,

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:46.850
they restricted my coverage

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.980
to only the problems
involving small and mid-sized mines.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.840
Substandard production safety,

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.159
mining beyond boundaries,

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:54.500
inadequate dust control,

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.320
and grassland pollution—

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.180
These problems

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:56.800
also exist

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.280
in Xinhai's mining areas.

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:01.250
I understand.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.190
What you said

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:06.570
is indeed the truth.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:08.830
But after all,

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.030
Xinhai operates on such a massive scale

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:12.300
and has so many pits.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.370
If these issues

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.500
were concentrated in one mine,

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.020
that would indeed be a problem.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:18.620
But

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.580
when they're scattered across

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:21.500
Xinhai's pits,

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:23.620
the problem actually

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:24.790
isn't that serious.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:26.630
Furthermore,

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.010
coal

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:30.180
is Tianduo's pillar industry.

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.870
As the leader in charge,

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.430
he must consider tax revenue.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:35.620
So, Huang

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:38.360
gave your editor-in-chief a heads-up.

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:39.210
You need

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.170
to be more understanding about this.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.600
I'm not some rookie

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:48.800
who just started working.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.880
Raising the hammer high,

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:50.940
only to tap gently.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.030
I've seen this plenty of times.

00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:55.100
You still

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.490
talk so harshly.

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:00.500
At first, I also thought

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.870
it was just like before,

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.120
that the leaders were afraid
that if the issues were spread out,

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.680
it would cause more serious troubles.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.810
Until a few days ago,

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:07.700
when it was proposed at the meeting

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:08.770
that Xinhai should take the lead

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:10.520
in consolidating those coal mines,

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.450
I couldn't help but be suspicious.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:20.300
Do you think

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.770
there's a problem with the consolidation?

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:23.190
No,

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:24.620
there's nothing wrong

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:26.420
with the consolidation itself.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:27.030
But when you

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:28.630
piece everything together,

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.470
that's where the problem lies.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.580
First, a reporter is brought in
for an undercover probe

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:34.549
to expose violations

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:35.610
at the small mines.

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:37.049
Then the authorities

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:38.169
act swiftly,

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.360
ordering an immediate shutdown
for rectification.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.460
And right then,

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:42.600
the "perfect" Xinhai Group,

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.390
the only company with a clean record,

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:46.250
steps in like a savior.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:47.580
They propose

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.770
a takeover plan

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.810
and use it as a stepping stone
to expand their empire.

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:53.920
Don't you think

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.870
it's all just a bit too convenient?

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:58.960
I've basically been used

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.420
as a weapon in their hands.

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:19.720
Shao,

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.300
you've made

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.600
a very serious accusation.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.480
It's just my theory.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:33.800
I also hope

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.260
I'm just overthinking it.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.080
So, in your theory,

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:43.310
what role do I,
the Executive Vice Mayor,

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:45.960
am playing in all this?

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:54.830
Who proposed

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:56.580
this consolidation plan?

00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:59.080
Was it proposed

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.490
before or after

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.580
my report came out?

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.060
You might not believe it.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:07.600
I haven't known

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.750
about this plan

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.300
much longer than you have.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:13.290
Of course, I believe you.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:16.510
To be honest,

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.170
I share

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:20.820
your concerns.

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:24.460
But procedurally speaking,

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:25.720
everything

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.650
is legal and legitimate.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:29.100
I...

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:31.660
I have no grounds

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:33.060
to object.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.600
I still want

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:40.830
to investigate Xinhai Group.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:42.900
I hope you can support me.

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:49.580
Here. It's from a new milk tea shop.

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.700
I waited in line
for twenty minutes for it.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.030
No thanks, you drink it.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.460
It's low sugar. Taste it.

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:56.390
Don't you know the taste

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:56.860
of the milk tea

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:57.860
we usually drink?

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:01.600
I...

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:12.360
I heard you threw out your back.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.090
Are you okay?

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:14.190
What did you want to see me about?

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:15.330
Just say it.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.910
I wanted to talk about it at home

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.630
and ask Mom for her opinion.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:23.080
I...

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:27.150
Ask Lingling's grandmother

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:28.200
for her opinion.

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:31.750
I still want to take you and Lingling

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.680
to live in the provincial capital.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:34.620
You've told me about this

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.260
many times already.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.300
I told you, I don't agree.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.720
Besides, we're already—

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.930
Divorced. I know.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:45.670
I'm doing this

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.270
for the child's sake.

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:48.000
After all,

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:48.980
the educational resources
in the provincial capital

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.030
are better than here.

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:51.630
Only a tiny fraction of students here
get into top-tier schools.

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:52.210
She will have to

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:53.870
leave this place eventually.

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.770
As for

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.060
other matters,

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:00.040
I haven't thought that far.

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:03.500
Shao Yunfei.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.020
Not everyone

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:07.390
wants to leave.

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:10.120
From when we were good

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.180
to when we split up,

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:13.600
I've always

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.020
respected your choices.

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.770
I also hope

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:17.340
you won't use

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:18.120
Lingling as an excuse

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.580
to interfere with my life.

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:22.160
The child needs her mother.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.980
But she also needs her father.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:25.190
But you didn't

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:26.990
stay in Tianduo because of that.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.320
Back then, you told me

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:29.700
to go back
and work in the provincial capital.

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:30.350
I told you to go,

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:30.980
and you just did?

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:31.380
You...

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:36.390
Forget it.

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.720
There's no point in bringing up the past.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.520
That's right.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:42.440
You think provincial capital schools

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.090
are better—

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:44.180
That was then.

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:46.900
These days, Tianduo's resources

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:47.940
and facilities

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:49.460
are just as good.

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:50.500
We have several

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.000
"Aid-to-Qinghai" schools

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.200
where teachers from Beijing

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.000
are actually leading the classes.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:55.650
Besides,

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:57.980
the competition in the provincial capital
is fierce,

00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:58.920
and the pressure is huge.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.320
Lingling is still young.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:01.240
I just want her

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.530
to be free and happy.

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:03.930
Plus, she has

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:05.190
friends here.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:05.940
If she goes there,

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.550
she'll have to readapt to everything.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:08.710
Kids are very

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:09.620
adaptable.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:14.920
Also, transferring my job

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:15.980
isn't that simple.

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:18.620
Going there

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.790
to sit in a government office job
would be boring.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:21.220
I'm not the type

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:22.240
who can sit still.

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:27.410
You really haven't changed a bit.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:31.080
What do you mean by that?

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:35.360
I know

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:36.620
why you don't want to leave.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:37.410
My lunch break

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:38.270
is almost over.

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:39.730
Get your things and leave.

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:52.630
[Xinhai Coal Mine]

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:02.510
Come in.

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:08.880
What is this?

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:10.240
Mr. Feng gave it to me.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.170
He told me to learn how to play golf.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.120
If he has time to play,

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:17.270
shouldn't he think about the mine?

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:19.030
If you have time
to complain about him,

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.750
why don't you think about

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.170
your own personal life?

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.010
Well.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:24.840
The consolidation plan

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.120
for small and medium coal mines in Tianduo

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.720
has been officially approved.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.180
Xinhai is taking the lead.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:30.820
I want

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.800
to bring you on board.

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:34.890
I'm fine with managing production.

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:38.000
But when it comes
to business consolidation,

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:39.770
I'm really a layman.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.680
You're in your 40s this year.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:48.940
Do you really plan
to stay on the front line

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:50.250
for the rest of your life?

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:51.220
If you don't take over now,

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:51.770
in another 10 years,

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:53.170
you'll still be a layman.

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:54.050
And then what?

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:56.190
Just waiting to be “optimized out?”

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:04.650
You said before

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:05.980
the group would make a big move.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:06.780
Is this it?

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:08.030
Take a good look.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.640
This is the toughest nut to crack.

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:12.420
The ownership of this pasture

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.880
is problematic, isn't it?

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:14.720
Yes.

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:18.040
It's a problem left over from the past.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:19.770
In this rectification,

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:20.500
we've acquired

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:21.290
a massive stretch of land

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:22.890
from the Chenlong Coal Mine.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.000
But as of now, there are still people

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.930
leasing that pasture for grazing.

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:31.630
This pasture

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.650
is very close to the Chenlong mining area.

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:35.550
It's no longer suitable for grazing.

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:36.120
Exactly.

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:37.270
That's why the company

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:38.150
wants to take it over

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.350
to use as a dumping ground for coal slag.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:41.790
The catch is

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:42.980
that the original contract

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:43.960
between the owner and Chenlong

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:44.720
has already

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:45.740
expired.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.270
So you're worried the owner

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:49.850
won't agree to let Xinhai
develop the land?

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:50.300
Right.

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:53.120
The biggest problem

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.920
is the owner of this pasture.

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:56.720
Cairen.

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:00.890
This is County Mayor Duo's pasture?

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:32.670
Dad.

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:34.870
I've come to see you.

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:36.580
Tashi Delek.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:37.960
Tashi Delek.

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:40.570
Did you quarrel with Bai Ju again?

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.220
You big jinx!

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:49.220
What was it about this time?

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:52.120
Here.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:55.630
Did you go skinning animals again?

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:58.360
You'd rather starve to death

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.140
than do that kind of thing.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:01.770
Let aside Ju,

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:03.250
even the sacred mountains

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:04.660
and the earth will frown upon you!

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:05.349
Okay, okay.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:06.440
I won't do it anymore.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.560
Don't be angry.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:08.849
Okay, okay.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:16.200
Do I...

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:18.089
Do I look that much like Bai Ji?

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.280
Bai Ju doesn't want to leave.

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:30.110
She likes it here.

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:31.690
Don't use the child

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:32.630
to force her.

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:34.980
If she just liked it here,

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:36.040
that would be fine.

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:37.470
You know

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:38.630
why she won't leave.

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:40.760
Her heart is still trapped there.

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.020
And you can't help her.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:43.460
That's right.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:45.870
I can't help anyone.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.180
I went back,

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:48.610
but I didn't

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:50.000
become a good reporter.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:53.640
After all these years,

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.090
nothing has changed.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:58.370
Things have changed, you know.

00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:59.170
Look at me.

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:00.720
I've traded the family pasture

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.250
for shares in the coal mine.

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:03.390
My wife and child

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:04.850
are living in the city now.

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:06.200
The kid can go to

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.370
a better school.

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:10.960
And I have it now.

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:13.410
I'll take you for a ride later.

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:19.610
Looking at it this way,

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.170
development is still good.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.730
Three steps forward, two steps back.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:27.860
It's still one step forward in the end.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:29.660
More than one step.

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:31.640
Hit the gas

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:32.790
and it's tens of thousands.

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:33.190
Can...

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:34.090
can you stop

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:35.550
talking about your car?

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:36.950
I feel like we're just not

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.830
on the same wavelength anymore.

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:39.640
I get it.

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:40.710
You're

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:42.510
having a midlife crisis.

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:45.830
Where are you getting all this from?

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.880
But...

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:50.010
Xinhai has started

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:52.410
consolidating small coal mines recently.

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:53.270
The land

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.550
around here might all get rezoned

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:57.030
in the next phase.

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:02.080
Does that affect this pasture?

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:03.820
Maybe.

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:07.190
You'd better be prepared.

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:22.170
Although I gave my family pasture

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:23.640
to the coal mine,

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:27.680
I want

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:30.760
to guard this pasture

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:31.820
for as long as I can.

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:39.200
Do you regret it?

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:43.670
Yaks follow the herdsman.

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:46.630
The herdsman follows the sun.

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:50.550
Patrolling with Captain Duojie

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:52.960
was the most worthwhile thing

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.250
in my life.

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:55.520
Well said!

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:02.700
Advice.

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:04.760
Advice.

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:08.920
More.

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:10.080
More.

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:11.350
Why are you looking at me?

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:12.460
Look at your notebook.

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:13.520
Write it yourself.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.400
Write.

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:20.870
Alright.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:21.560
Let me see.

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:27.830
You'll need to work faster

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:29.250
on your homework from now on.

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:30.000
You need to focus.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:30.730
Understand?

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:32.470
Okay.

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:33.620
What other homework

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.280
do you have left for this week?

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.240
Only the weekly diary is left.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:39.180
Let me check it

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.330
after you finish it.

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:41.330
Mom,

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.810
that's my privacy.

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:43.880
What privacy?

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:45.060
Last time,

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:46.010
you copied directly from the essay book.

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:47.130
Your teacher told me about it.

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:48.460
You think I didn't know?

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.730
Hurry up and write.

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:51.460
I'll check it when you're done.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:52.330
Chop-chop.

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:54.270
You need to have a proper attitude
towards studying,

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:54.970
you know?

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:56.500
Lingling,

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:58.450
have some fruit.

00:20:58.450 --> 00:20:59.560
Thanks, Grandma.

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:00.500
Rest for a while.

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:01.530
Mom, she just started writing,

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:03.370
and you're letting her rest again.

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:05.170
Come inside with me for a second.

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:09.010
Finish eating and get to your homework.

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:10.000
Stop fidgeting and focus.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:10.430
Get it?

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:14.900
Mom,

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:16.910
I was educating the child.

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:18.500
Why did you interrupt?

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:20.840
I also want to educate

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:21.640
my child.

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:23.810
What did I do?

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:25.270
Shao

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.230
went to your workplace to find you?

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:31.180
What did you talk about?

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:32.310
Nothing much.

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.160
I don't care

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.240
what he tells you—

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:37.360
don't you try to talk me into it.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.000
I'm not Ji.

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:40.620
I won't side with outsiders.

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:43.620
I just hope

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.020
that there's someone

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:46.450
to keep you company.

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:48.750
It doesn't have to be Shao.

00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.890
What?

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:01.760
Take a look.

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:11.500
What's this for?

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:12.980
What's this for?

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:15.860
He's Ms. Wang's son.

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:17.060
Who is Ms. Wang?

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.200
She came to our hospital as a patient.

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:20.530
She's very warm.

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:22.320
Her son,

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:22.940
right now—

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:23.570
Mom,

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:25.050
I'm forty.

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:26.600
Her son is a few years older than you.

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.800
The age is perfect.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.310
He's a company executive

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:29.920
and successful in his career.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.980
My daughter is already ten years old.

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:33.700
He has never been married,

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:34.800
has no children,

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.020
and he doesn't mind it.

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:36.670
I mean,

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:38.140
at my age,

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:40.790
I'm... at that point

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:41.740
where in a couple of years,

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:42.280
just a single sneeze

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.610
could throw my back out.

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:45.050
Why... Why are you arranging this

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:45.850
for me?

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:47.140
Your back

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.380
might be fine

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:49.360
by then.

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.640
Just think of it as making a new friend.

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:53.500
And he might not

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:54.450
be interested in you.

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:55.500
What are you afraid of?

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:55.830
I—

00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:57.870
Just go meet him.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.640
If you have time to worry about me,

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.370
why don't you think

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:04.250
about Bai Chun's personal situation?

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:05.110
I'm not the only one

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:06.450
single in this family.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.020
Captain.

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:16.290
Okay.

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.870
I get it.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:18.400
I'm going right now.

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:20.050
Don't mention it.

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:20.780
Okay.

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:22.470
Do you have a mission?

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.030
Captain's parent

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:25.030
is having emergency surgery,

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:26.560
so he has to go check on them.

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:27.040
Remember

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.970
to check Lingling's weekly dairy.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.270
Last time she wrote

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:31.320
that she wants

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.110
to be a firefighter like her dad.

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.760
The teacher

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.160
thought I got remarried.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:35.950
I know.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.890
What's wrong with remarrying?

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:17.780
Hello.

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:18.310
Police.

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:19.300
Routine inspection.

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:20.050
Please cooperate.

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:20.380
Okay.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:20.830
Okay.

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:21.870
Where is V01?

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:22.490
Take us there.

00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:22.820
Okay.

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:28.090
♪ The song is like the bright spring... ♪

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:28.820
Stop singing

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:31.290
Police.

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:33.940
Put down everything in your hands.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:34.470
Put down.

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:38.270
Well...

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:38.800
Sit down.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.220
Give the camera to Wang.

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:48.490
You organize the urine tests.

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:49.880
Where are you going, Captain?

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:50.400
I'll step out

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.720
and call my superiors to report.

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.320
My immediate family is here.

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:54.610
Go ahead.

00:24:58.020 --> 00:24:59.000
Get your IDs out

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:00.080
for registration.

00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:04.230
I am Bai Ju's brother,

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.760
Bai Chun.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.290
Who is

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:11.950
Meng Yaohui?

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:14.330
Okay, I understand.

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:16.230
I'll be careful.

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:16.800
Careful.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:17.860
Careful. Careful.

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:18.650
Okay.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.410
Which room are you from?

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:24.920
V01.

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:25.910
What's wrong?

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.060
What's your name?

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:39.800
Meng Yaohui.

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:42.110
She is my client.

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:43.830
I just came out of the restroom

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:44.800
and saw she was drunk,

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:45.540
so I helped her.

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:46.780
We received a report

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:48.030
that you were leading people here

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:49.920
to use illegal substances

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:52.510
and engage in illegal activities.

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:55.040
Go inside and cooperate
with the inspection.

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:56.220
Take him inside.

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:56.820
Let's go.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:03.370
Wu Jinxuan.

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:04.180
Check it.

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:05.830
The urine test result is negative.

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:06.990
If there's no problem, sign here.

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:08.120
There's no problem.

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:12.620
Take it.

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:14.300
Captain.

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:15.190
We've checked.

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:16.590
Everyone's urine test results

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:17.390
are negative.

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:18.080
No issues.

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:20.030
Have all their identities been confirmed?

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:20.690
Yes.

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:21.720
They are all

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.250
employees of Xinhai Coal Mine

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:24.310
and their clients.

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:25.990
Okay.

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:28.390
The suspicion

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:29.960
of drug use and other illegal conduct

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:30.960
has been ruled out

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:31.610
for now.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.600
Thank you for your cooperation.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.170
Let's go.

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:37.580
Mr. Wang, wait a moment.

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:38.350
Officer.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.000
I'd like to ask,

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.080
who reported us?

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.260
We have regulations.

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:47.880
We cannot reveal

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.410
the informant's identity.

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:51.030
I suspect

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:53.010
someone filed a malicious report.

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:53.930
Don't you deal with

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:55.110
the false report?

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:56.430
When we get back,

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:57.850
we will investigate it.

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:00.400
If there's a false report,

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:03.100
we will handle it according to the law.

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:05.370
Any other questions?

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.610
No.

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:10.850
Thank you.

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:13.510
Let's go.

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:33.440
I've passed this shop

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.650
many times,

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:36.790
but this is my first time coming in.

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:37.630
I heard from my mom

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:38.760
that you are a local.

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:41.090
Yes.

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:44.100
But...

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:46.380
I've been busy with work,

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:48.840
so I'm not familiar with this area.

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.940
Do you go on blind dates often?

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:56.020
Why do you need blind dates?

00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:57.110
With your condition,

00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:59.710
you shouldn't have trouble
finding a partner.

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:02.570
If not for a blind date,

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:05.170
why would you come out to meet me?

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:10.930
Is that a hard question to answer?

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:12.560
No.

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:14.440
It's just...

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:17.990
this is my first blind date,

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:21.750
and the person I'm dating
is a police officer.

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:23.270
I'm a little nervous.

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:28.050
Are you like this on all your blind dates?

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:29.200
Like what?

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:30.770
Like...

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:34.550
like you're interrogating me.

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:38.210
I just don't think

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:38.740
we're a good fit.

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:40.400
We're not from the same world.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.380
I believe

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.660
in first impressions.

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:49.130
So, you're the type

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.020
who makes snap judgments.

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:54.130
But you can't judge people

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:55.400
only by their appearance.

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.180
After all...

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:57.610
this is

00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:58.340
the first time we've met.

00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:58.940
This isn't

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:00.110
the first time.

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:05.660
After all this,

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:06.080
you still haven't

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.340
answered my question.

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.050
Why did you agree to meet me?

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:11.690
What about you?

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:13.080
Why did you agree

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.060
to have a meal with me?

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:15.120
To deal with my mom.

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:15.770
Me too.

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:16.460
You're lying.

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:17.460
Do you have proof?

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:23.700
Intuition.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.880
If I were really a bad guy,

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.610
you wouldn't be able
to catch me like this.

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:34.740
You and Bai Chun

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:35.830
are nothing alike.

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.570
He is an honest man.

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:38.850
Back then—

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:39.940
He is very capable.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.420
How else could he
have become the mine chief?

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:45.400
Our company's

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:46.700
Vice President Wu Jiang

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:47.890
outranks Bai Chun,

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:50.360
but he's stuck managing Mine No. 2.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.690
So, he's always giving him a hard time.

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:54.120
I called him out on it a few times,

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.860
and now he holds a grudge against me, too.

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.630
The one who filed
that false report last time

00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:58.890
was probably Wu Jiang.

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.180
My job is to maintain order

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:03.250
and fight crime,

00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:04.960
not to help you and Chun

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.460
get rid of your competition.

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:07.520
It's not like that.

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:09.600
I was just complaining to you

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.400
about my unreliable colleague.

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:13.440
I didn't intend to go after him.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.140
But...

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:16.740
Does Bai Chun

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:17.830
never talk to you

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:18.880
about his work?

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.330
Or do you

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.370
just not care?

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.970
Tianduo isn't that big,

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.900
and the Xinhai mining area
isn't far at all.

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:28.620
We siblings

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:29.500
are very close.

00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:31.220
Then how come

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.500
you only know me today?

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:43.120
Han.

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:45.170
I heard that a few days ago,

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:46.570
you were caught by Bai Ju.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:47.460
You stay here all day,

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:48.990
but you're well-informed.

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.180
Whatever happens in the city,

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:55.400
the wind blowing from there

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.430
will tell me.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.420
News about you has spread.

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:00.140
Even the eagles on the snow mountains

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:01.030
and the marmots on the ground

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:01.860
know about it.

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:05.210
You talk too much.

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:06.870
If you're so capable,
don't borrow money from me

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:08.330
after the fine is settled.

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:09.770
I'm borrowing it anyway.

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.810
You seized

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:12.160
so many pelts this time.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.100
A couple of days ago,

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:16.560
County Mayor Lin came by.

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:18.070
I think there's hope

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.010
for your permanent positions.

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:21.640
Zhacuo.

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:22.180
County Mayor Lin

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:23.240
is a Vice Mayor now, right?

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.130
Look at you, such a big shot.

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:26.130
What brings him all the way out here?

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:27.880
It's been so many years.

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.780
When you hear "permanent position",

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:31.380
you act like a dog with a bone.

00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:33.310
Pay me back. Pay me back now.

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:34.750
I don't have any. I don't have any.

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:36.320
That's just Dad's nonsense.

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:36.950
To him,

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:38.110
if you wear a jacket

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:38.960
and carry a briefcase,

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.360
you're County Mayor Lin.

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.560
It was Shao who came by a few days ago.

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:45.290
He got snapped at by Bai again, didn't he?

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:46.950
Shao told me

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:48.650
there's a problem with this pasture.

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:49.330
Look.

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:51.590
County Mayor Lin is here again.

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:01.790
County Mayor Lin!

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:03.530
Tashi Delek.

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:04.710
Hello.

00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:06.180
Tashi Delek, sir.

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:08.860
Mr. Zhacuo.

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:10.600
Hello, everyone.

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.290
I'm Meng Yaohui,

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:13.120
General Manager

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.050
of Xinhai Group.

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:16.560
What are you doing here?

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:18.790
I've heard of Xinhai. Hello.

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:20.430
That's good.

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:22.240
If you know us,

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:23.110
then communicating

00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:24.240
will be much easier.

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.090
Xinhai Group

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:26.920
is currently consolidating

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.260
the coal mines

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:30.130
and handling some legacy issues

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:30.850
regarding pasture acquisition

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:32.060
and usage rights.

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:33.180
I'm here

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.430
to talk about

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:36.320
the ownership of this grassland.

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:38.290
This is the previous contract.

00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:38.950
Take a look.

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:40.010
Here, Mr. Zhacuo.

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:48.610
Look, what this is about.

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:54.900
Zhacuo.

00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:57.060
Did Ms. Cairen

00:32:57.090 --> 00:32:57.840
ever transfer

00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.170
this pasture back then?

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:01.400
No, I don't think so.

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:03.060
Otherwise,

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:04.120
she wouldn't let me

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:04.830
graze here.

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:06.530
Then, where did

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:07.930
this contract come from?

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:10.480
I

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:11.270
don't know.

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:12.070
This contract

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:12.680
was signed by Cairen

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.080
with Chenlong Coal Mine.

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:14.810
At the time, Cairen

00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:16.210
probably took a deposit.

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:17.260
But Chenlong Coal Mine

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:18.530
did not use this pasture

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:19.360
within

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:20.720
the stipulated validity period.

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.520
Now Chenlong has been merged into Xinhai.

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:23.820
Xinhai wants to re-evaluate

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:24.810
and purchase this pasture's

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:25.260
usage rights.

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:26.070
No need.

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:28.320
We're not selling for any price.

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.390
At current land prices,

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:30.240
we definitely won't

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.650
let Miss Cairen lose out.

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:32.550
After all,

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:33.220
we are all

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:34.400
from Mazhi County.

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:34.910
You all know

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:36.020
the friendship between our family

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:37.110
and Duojie's family.

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:38.150
You can rest assured.

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:39.010
That's exactly

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:40.090
why we're worried.

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:41.600
Bai Chun.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:42.810
You've got nothing

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:44.120
but dollar signs in your eyes.

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.520
How dare you mention Duojie?

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:45.980
Han.

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:48.350
Calm down first.

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:50.770
It's not your pasture,

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.280
so you have no say in this.

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:53.430
We're here

00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:54.040
to ask you

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:55.140
to contact Cairen.

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:56.790
Regarding this pasture,

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:58.180
we'll pay to use it

00:33:58.250 --> 00:33:59.730
and restore it afterwards.

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:00.930
Restore?

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:02.550
You think we can't see

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:03.020
how high the cinder

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:03.700
is piled?

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:05.160
Do you take us for fools?

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:05.720
Han.

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:08.080
Duojie has been

00:34:08.489 --> 00:34:09.949
missing for so many years.

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:12.070
And the contract is signed.

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:13.060
What's the point

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:14.500
of you clinging

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:16.139
to this pasture?

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:18.300
Does his disappearance
have to do with you?

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:18.550
Han.

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:19.150
Calm down.

00:34:19.199 --> 00:34:20.000
What business is it of yours?

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:20.310
Han.

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:21.090
Han.

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:21.650
Get off the pasture!

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:22.190
Han, calm down.

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:22.590
Get out!

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:22.940
Han.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:23.440
Get out!

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:24.420
Get out!

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:24.730
Han.

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:25.310
Get out!

00:34:25.489 --> 00:34:26.949
Hit this County Mayor Lin!

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:28.020
Hit him! Hit him!

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:28.630
Get the hell out!

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:28.900
Han.

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:29.780
What are you doing?

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:30.510
Don't fight.

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:31.590
Stop.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:33.110
You want to fight?

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:34.070
Don't fight.

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:41.290
What are you doing?

00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:41.960
Let go!

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:56.510
Just speak.

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:57.560
Stop drinking.

00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:59.240
You called her.

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.100
I have nothing to say.

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:02.750
You two remaining in this deadlock

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:03.410
is not good.

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:04.600
Have a good talk.

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:06.550
Mind your own business.

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:08.950
Why don't you go

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:10.150
get Shao Yunfei here?

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.780
It's all because of
his nonsense reporting

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.730
about promoting coal mine consolidation.

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:15.900
With all of this,

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.960
Captain's pasture is about

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:19.220
to be in others' hands.

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:22.010
Every debt has its debtor.

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:24.240
You can't

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:25.900
blame Shao Yunfei.

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:27.460
Besides,

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:29.640
he's getting a headache over it, too.

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:30.410
Right.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.800
If you want to blame someone,
blame the coal mines,

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:36.610
blame Xinhai,

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:40.100
and blame some people

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:41.700
for not having a firm stance.

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:50.340
I know all these years,

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:52.070
you haven't been able to let go.

00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:53.320
But not everyone

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:54.530
has to be like you,

00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:56.030
going on a wild goose chase

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:57.000
with a detector

00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:58.760
just to do right by the Captain.

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:01.090
You have the nerve to mention him?

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:02.110
If you can,

00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:03.430
why can't I?

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.120
Bai, he drank his brains out.

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:07.180
Don't lower yourself to his level.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.100
It's been 17 years.

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:19.210
In these 17 years,

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:20.920
I went to prison

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:23.220
and questioned the convicts
from back then.

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:24.770
The Bureau also caught

00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:25.960
two fugitives involved in

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.360
the Qima'er Gold Mine case.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:29.360
You all know about the public trial.

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:30.750
But the information they provided

00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:31.670
had nothing to do

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:33.470
with Captain's disappearance.

00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:35.070
Li Yongqiang's funds

00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:36.090
came from abroad back then.

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:38.150
We didn't have the jurisdiction
to trace them.

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:39.000
And his family

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:39.820
left the country long ago.

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:40.420
Since then,

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:41.880
they have never returned.

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:42.800
The Public Security Bureau

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:43.290
has regularly

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:44.400
informed Miss Cairen.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.830
No one has forgotten him.

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:49.350
Is it fair for you to say that about us?

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:54.270
I've said before,

00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:57.870
environmental protection
doesn't come from protesting.

00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:00.200
I believe even if Captain were here,

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:01.200
he wouldn't agree

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:02.740
with what you're doing now.

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:10.350
Do you know

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:12.310
why the city wants to open the mine?

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.070
For the coal bosses to make money.

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:16.590
Yes.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.460
The coal bosses do make money.

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:19.420
But a large part

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:20.360
of the tax revenue

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:21.760
relies on the coal mines.

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:23.150
Don't think just because Chun
is the mine chief,

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:24.930
our family is benefiting from them.

00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:26.010
To put it bluntly,

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:27.930
everyone here,

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:29.220
every citizen of Tianduo,

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:30.720
is benefiting from them.

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:33.010
Take you, Han Xuechao.

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:35.300
You work as a security guard at the mall.

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:36.300
If there were no coal mines,

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:36.890
the economy

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:37.690
wouldn't be this good.

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:38.960
There wouldn't be a mall,

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.960
and you'd have no mall gate to watch!

00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:42.170
Alright, alright.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:43.880
The priority now

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:44.640
is to talk to Miss Cairen

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:45.700
about the pasture.

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.000
Mr. Meng

00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:49.540
said one thing right.

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:51.810
This pasture isn't ours.

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:53.850
We don't have a say in it.

00:37:59.010 --> 00:37:59.950
Tashi said

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:02.200
his mom is in poor health now

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:03.860
and doesn't want to come back.

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:05.420
She's afraid that if she comes back,

00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:06.750
she'll think of Captain

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:08.750
and be heartbroken.

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:10.900
Tashi wants

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:12.400
to keep this pasture.

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:13.650
Actually,

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:15.770
if we really get into it,

00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:18.150
we might not have a leg to stand on.

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.920
And Xinhai is such a big enterprise.

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:22.130
If they're dead set

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:23.300
on getting this land,

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.100
they have plenty of ways to do it.

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:26.790
What kind of means?

00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:29.350
This is a society governed by law.

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:30.430
Fine.

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:32.140
If Xinhai files a lawsuit,

00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:33.360
can we win?

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:35.270
Even if we could,

00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:36.480
lawyers cost money,

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:38.700
and litigation costs money.

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:43.900
I think

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.530
we should just transfer it.

00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:46.620
Xinhai said

00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:48.110
they'd offer a good price.

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:50.110
Is this about money?

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:54.870
If Captain were here,

00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:55.820
he would never

00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:56.970
let any pasture

00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:58.320
be covered in coal slag!

00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:01.200
Han.

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:03.710
Are you criticizing me?

00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:08.670
No.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:12.500
No.

00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:17.190
If we really sell the pasture,

00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:22.540
what if Captain's soul comes back

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:25.720
and can't find his way home?

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:27.950
What do you mean by that, Han?

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:29.630
Ask the Tibetans

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:30.850
if they believe that.

00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:31.880
Besides,

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:33.410
is it your place to say that?

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:35.190
He has been missing

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.960
for 17 years.

00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:37.010
Ms. Cairen

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:38.380
and Tashi don't live here.

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:39.590
Why keep this land?

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:40.390
Sangba.

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:01.190
Han.

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:07.700
I'm

00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:10.790
on the night shift tonight.

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:22.390
I'll see him out.

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:35.330
Bai Ju.

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:37.830
Take this.

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:40.930
It's homemade yak jerky.

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:42.640
For Lingling.

00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:45.320
Kids need nutrition

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:46.260
when they're growing.

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:46.760
Thanks.

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:47.860
Don't mention it.

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:51.640
Han...

00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:52.980
You know him.

00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:57.170
All these years,

00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:58.210
he's been alone.

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:00.230
Regarding Captain,

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:01.490
he took it the hardest.

00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:03.280
Sometimes I think

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:06.960
having this hope to hold onto

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:08.170
is a good thing.

00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:10.230
Otherwise, I don't know

00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:10.860
how he would have survived

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:11.950
all these years.

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:14.010
Do you think

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:16.560
I blame him?

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:19.500
I'm saying you're different.

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:20.770
You have a family.

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:26.480
You don't need to pass on
messages for Shao Yunfei.

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:28.910
This is what I want to tell you, too.

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:31.010
To investigate this,

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:34.430
you haven't had
any other baby for 7 years.

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.380
You've done enough,

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.050
Bai.

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:44.300
Have you

00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:48.170
dreamed of the Mountain Patrol after that?

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:50.530
Of course.

00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:54.520
Do you dream of them often?

00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:58.510
Bai.

00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:02.070
Streams thin out as they flow.

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:05.040
Grass grows coarse as it ages.

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:06.990
Things fade over time.

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:08.280
Everything will pass.

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:17.200
Yes.

00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:20.390
He used to say,

00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:23.860
"Everyone leaves eventually."

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.720
After we're gone,

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:30.350
no one will

00:42:30.370 --> 00:42:31.480
dream of Bolamula.

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:36.040
And no one will remember

00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:39.620
that this was once his home.

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:46.510
I hope I can guard this place

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:50.570
and keep it

00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:51.570
the way it was.

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:54.940
Sometimes,

00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:56.570
the things people forget,

00:42:57.980 --> 00:42:59.510
the land remembers for you.

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:09.790
