WEBVTT

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.520
Morning breeze blows

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.200
Evening rain falls

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.800
Cutting short the years

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.600
The last blossoms fall

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.600
Pear blossom scent

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.640
Brews the spring colors

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.240
The wheel of fortune turns at last

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.200
Today

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.480
you lose

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.000
The winner is yet to be decided

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.520
Old Wu

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.400
Old Wu

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.360
It's useless

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.840
This lock is clearly specially made

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.280
Even if you find

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.720
an expert thief skilled in lockpicking

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.400
it would take at least an hour

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.160
Besides, there are four keyholes here

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.160
It requires four keys turned simultaneously

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.280
to get through

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.240
This needle...

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.080
why does it look familiar?

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.240
What kind of brain do you have?

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.520
How can your own stuff not look familiar?

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.400
Believe it or not, I'll hit...

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.160
Our top priority right now

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.280
is to open this door

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.080
Meiren

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.360
Go get my hammer

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.320
Go

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.720
Here

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.400
You hit it

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.280
The harder, the better

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.160
Hit it

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.880
Compared to opening doors the normal way

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.160
I prefer the most direct method

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.360
Young Mistress Tang

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.280
you really are a walking weapon of mass destruction

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.440
I almost forgot

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.120
Tangmen Mechanism Arts

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.560
are peerlessly exquisite

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.840
and unmatched by anyone

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.880
Come on

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.920
A night tour of Linggu Temple Pagoda

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.040
starts now

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.960
Young Mistress

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.800
I won't go into the pagoda with you

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.280
After all, I'd just hold you back

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.320
Someone like me

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.720
is better suited for logistics

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.240
I think

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.360
sticking with us

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.760
is safer

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:52.600
The sword and the bag!

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.960
Wait for me!

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.680
Wait for me!

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.920
Rumor has it that inside the pagoda

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.560
criminals who committed heinous crimes are imprisoned

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.400
They were secretly recruited by the Eastern Depot as Secret Guards

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.400
to guard the dossiers inside the pagoda

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.480
Their methods are extreme and unscrupulous

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.240
and hard to predict

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.080
This place is a bit eerie.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.920
Anyway, I don't feel comfortable.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.440
It's like we are...

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.360
...prey that has fallen into a cage.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.520
This is our cage.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.240
This place was built upon our life's work.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.040
We will not tolerate your insolence.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.440
We ask not of your origin.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.680
Nor of your destination.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.640
Only if you can get past the three of us...

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.280
...can you proceed to the top of the tower.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.440
Wu Qiangu.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.520
It has been a long time.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.240
Weird Old Man.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.240
Do you know them?

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.680
They were once unforgivable gamblers.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.360
Unlike ordinary people...

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.760
...their underground dealings...

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.600
...wagered not only gold, silver, and jewels...

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.080
...houses and fertile fields...

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.640
...but also what others cherished most.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.560
Hands, feet, eyes.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.560
Even wives and children.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.400
Luring you step by step into their...

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.320
...abyss of gambling.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.160
The Imperial Grand Court of Justice...

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.560
...arrested them...

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.160
...and sentenced them to death by a thousand cuts.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.320
But due to their mastery of Yin and Yang and Feng Shui...

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.640
...the Eastern Depot secretly saved them...

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.640
...and recruited them as Secret Guards...

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.880
...to serve under their command.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.600
Who would have thought...

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.200
...they would be used in a place like this.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.720
Years ago, I wanted to challenge you.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.800
Who knew you'd do the foolish deed of severing your own hand?

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.000
Now I'll have to go easy on you.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.800
After all these years...

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.960
...you haven't changed a bit.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.320
Still so obsessed with gambling.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.120
Didn't you once experience it too?

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.560
How could you forget our trials now?

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.280
Green Ghost.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.120
It is up to you...

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.160
...to show them our pleasure.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.720
Looking at your faces...

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.840
...you do not look like those who use street gambling tricks.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.400
Why don't we play something simple?

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.800
How can you guarantee...

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.560
...that you won't cheat?

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.760
Since Senior Wu Qiangu is here...

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.400
...why would I teach a fish to swim?

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.120
I prefer to let luck decide the winner.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.880
Isn't that more exciting?

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:17.800
The rules?

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.280
Before we begin...

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.680
...let's make the rules clear.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:21.920
It's very simple.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.600
The heavens have the Five Elements:

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.760
Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.120
They evolve with time to form all things.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.640
Metal overcomes Wood, Wood overcomes Earth, Earth overcomes Water...

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.160
...Water overcomes Fire, and Fire overcomes Metal.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.120
Metal corresponds to White, Wood to Green...

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.680
...Water to Black, Fire to Red, and Earth to Yellow.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.920
Green Ghost will deal the cards.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.440
Two cards to each person.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.680
Each will choose one card from them.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.000
The winner is decided by the Five Elements cycle of destruction.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.480
Best two out of three.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.320
Isn't that fair?

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.560
This is indeed a matter of luck.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:54.920
What do you want to bet?

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:55.600
A secret.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.200
I want to know...

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.240
...your true purpose for coming here.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.440
This game is simple.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.800
It is manageable enough...

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.200
...for me to play.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.840
You are too humble, Senior.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.040
Since it is about luck...

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:35.920
...I won't hesitate.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.040
Let me see your luck then.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:45.880
I won.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.040
Water overcomes Fire.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.200
The Weird Old Man has good luck.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.760
If he had chosen Wood...

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.240
...the result might have been different.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.000
Senior is off to a winning start.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.200
Win one more round against me, and victory is yours.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.040
Continue.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:07.640
Let's go.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.960
Who gave him such confidence?

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:24.880
This round,

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.680
as long as Old Wu draws a Wood card that overcomes Earth,

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:29.560
we are sure to win.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.560
Although it involves luck,

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.720
gambling also requires a cool head.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.840
Your attempt to goad me

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.280
is a bit shallow.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:46.880
I've said it before,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.640
this is a game of luck.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.680
One defends, one kills.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:58.520
A draw.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:11:59.840
Then,

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.040
we enter the deciding round.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:03.840
Zhang Shaoqing,

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:04.920
Battalion Commander Yuan,

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.320
Commissioner Shen,

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.760
take your men

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.080
and follow me into the tower to investigate.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.040
The rest of you, thirty guard the entrance,

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.480
thirty patrol the perimeter.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.600
If you find anything suspicious,

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.480
kill on sight.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.120
If after two hours,

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.320
I have not emerged,

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.840
all Embroidered Uniform Guards here

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.000
must rush into the tower to assist.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.200
Yes, sir.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:35.280
Wait.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.800
What is it, Senior?

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:40.640
I want to

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.160
raise the stakes.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.000
Knowing others' secrets is your joy.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.760
Gambling is a two-way street.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.000
Naturally, I

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.880
also want to claim my joy.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.920
If I win this round,

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:57.720
I want...

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:01.800
You want me?

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.240
It is your face.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.880
I see your skin is smooth and fine.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.040
If I were to peel it off

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.760
and give it to Yu Meiren here,

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.800
she would surely be delighted.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.760
Such a handsome face

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.640
to make a skin for a puppet,

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.840
it really is excellent material.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.480
Since the game has already begun,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.560
I have no reason

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.520
to refuse any fair terms.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.880
I will draw first.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.200
Please, Senior.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.400
Old Wu, calm down!

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.000
Is he crazy?

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:15.800
No.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.000
He has seen through the game.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:31.720
I lost.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.240
We won.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.360
We won, right?

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.120
We won, we won.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.280
Every time you drew a card,

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:39.280
Green Ghost

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:40.840
would stand on our side.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.200
Seemingly following rules and waiting

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.800
to prevent us from cheating.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:45.800
In reality,

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.000
it was to give Red Ghost opposite us

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:49.840
a signal.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.080
You love your appearance,

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.440
and the bronze mirror you carry

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.640
happens to be able to see

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.200
the signals Red Ghost sends you.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.120
In the first round,

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.040
you gave me a taste of success first,

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.320
to test me.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.800
When you were sure you had me,

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:05.640
in the second round,

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.520
you applied fear and pressure,

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:12.000
trying to make me panic.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.280
I didn't see her

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.600
giving any hints.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.200
One is Water.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.280
Two is Fire.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.520
Three is Wood, Four is Metal, Five is Earth.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:22.800
Did you notice

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:25.480
her hand?

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.200
A veteran is a veteran.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.400
You had already seen through everything,

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.920
just disrupting their rhythm and cheating.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.480
The true meaning of this gamble,

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.560
isn't it just about luck?

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.440
You actually used luck

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.040
in the deciding round.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.560
How could it be pure luck?

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.040
Those who can send messages the same way

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.520
aren't just you people.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.640
Are you ready now

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.000
to give me your face skin?

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.760
When you peeled off others' faces,

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.200
you never hesitated.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.120
A bet is a bet.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.160
Black Ghost.

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.560
The Tang Clan's Record of Villains clearly states:

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.800
Beautiful appearance, jealous nature.

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.360
Likes collecting beautiful skins,

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.680
cannot tolerate others' beauty.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.640
Today, the light of justice offers a chance.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:15.800
My sword

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.360
is already thirsting.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.760
Gambling on luck and greed

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.800
only leads to the karmic cycle.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.360
When gambling luck runs out,

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.440
you will pay double the price.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.160
If you aren't prepared to sacrifice for the gamble,

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.200
how are you fit

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.520
to live by gambling?

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.240
Forget it.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.960
Without this face skin,

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.240
what difference is there from being dead?

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.040
This cage,

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.240
I'm tired of staying in it too.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.040
To view a single failure

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.800
as a humiliating disgrace,

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.760
is truly arrogant, narrow-minded, and pathetic.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:25.600
Reap what you sow.

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.280
Gentlemen, please.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.200
I am different from her.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.440
I won't entrust winning or losing

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.280
to luck.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.280
Hold on.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.600
Wu Qiangu has already gambled one round.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.200
We need to switch people.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.360
As for who to switch to,

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.080
I think this is what

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:44.320
you should be weighing now.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.040
Commissioner Shen

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.440
What should we do next?

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.080
This place looks like a maze.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.120
But actually,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.360
there should be another exit.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.800
Those who always win at gambling

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.800
always make sure

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.360
they are fully prepared for victory.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.280
If you want to gain something,

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.400
you must first give something.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.280
For you people,

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.760
the most precious thing

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.640
must be time, right?

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:44.280
Then,

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.480
I will bet time with you.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.560
If you lose,

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.240
you must leave one person behind

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.720
to keep us company.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.680
I won't let them escape easily.

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.400
It's really lively today.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.480
I fear these guests are here for you.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.280
They linger like ghosts.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:12.600
They arrived too quickly.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.160
Since you are so confident in your skills,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:17.720
this round,

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.520
I will play with you.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.320
The game has begun.

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.120
No interruptions allowed.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.400
Excellent.

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.640
I don't like complicated things either.

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:29.920
Young Mistress,

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.640
I admit your martial arts are the best in the world,

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:32.960
but as for gambling skills,

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.080
let's just forget it.

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.480
In case you lose...

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.000
Who says I will lose?

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.480
I am the Tang Clan's Celestial Tang Xi.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.200
Born to turn bad luck into good,

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.480
and misfortune into fortune.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.600
State the rules.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.160
One hundred and eight Water Margin playing cards.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.960
Two decks mixed together.

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.120
Flip and match.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.480
Whoever matches the most pairs

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.400
is the winner.

00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.120
If I win,

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.960
I want you to use all your skills and your life

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:03.680
to hold off the Embroidered Uniform Guards outside

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:04.720
for one incense stick's time.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.120
Then what are we waiting for?

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:11.640
Come on.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:16.760
Please.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.080
Great Blade, Guan Sheng.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.360
Pilgrim, Wu Song.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:45.720
Great Blade, Guan Sheng.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.360
Pilgrim, Wu Song.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.080
It seems in this round,

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.600
Red Ghost has no chance to cheat for him.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.440
Green Ghost has too much pride.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.640
He won't seek help from others.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.120
River Dragon, Li Jun.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.360
River Dragon, Li Jun.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:18.800
Protector of Justice, Song Jiang.

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.480
Flowery Monk, Lu Zhishen.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.280
Their memory skills are evenly matched.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.520
Whenever a card is flipped,

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:25.880
they memorize the position instantly.

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:27.520
There are no mistakes at all.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.800
It comes down to who flips the matching card first

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.160
without aiding the opponent.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.200
Gold Lancer, Xu Ning.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.760
Panther Head, Lin Chong.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.000
I'm asking you what to do!

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:38.800
Why are you playing the flute?

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.480
Is this the time to play the flute?

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:41.160
Deputy Commander Yin,

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.640
this flute sound must be a signal

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.360
to connect with someone inside the pagoda.

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:46.560
In that case,

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:47.640
important places

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:48.680
won't just let anyone

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:49.480
come and go as they please.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.440
The contact person.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:51.840
So where is the contact person?

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.920
Tang Xi, twelve pairs.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.600
Green Ghost, fifteen pairs.

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.520
If that crazy girl makes another mistake,

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.320
this round will be...

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.120
Nine Tattooed Dragons, Shi Jin.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.320
Nine Tattooed Dragons, Shi Jin.

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:23.120
lost.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.160
You can still smile?

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.520
In this world,

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.920
there are no two identical leaves.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.360
It's just self-deception.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.360
Your cards are the same.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.760
These patterns

00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.640
are truly beautiful.

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.400
I lost.

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.400
A bet is a bet.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.520
I will help you

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.360
hold off those Embroidered Uniform Guards.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.120
For one incense stick's time.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.160
What's the situation?

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.040
Apologies for the wait, my lords.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.840
Since you have come to our Linggu Temple Pagoda,

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.400
wherever you wish to go,

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.760
you must follow our rules.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.080
Water Margin playing cards.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.120
Do you know how to play?

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:14.800
What did you say to Green Ghost

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:16.440
that he admitted defeat immediately?

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.520
I saw through his cheating method

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:19.760
and told him,

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:21.760
if he didn't admit defeat now,

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.280
I would reveal his cheating method

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.240
to the whole world.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.760
The truly smart mastermind behind this

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.280
shouldn't it be you?

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.120
You want to play with me?

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.360
I am not as stupid as they are.

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.200
This cage of mine

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.920
is built according to the Five Elements and Feng Shui.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.440
Since you are the Tang Clan Young Mistress,

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.280
and have some connection with Master Konghui,

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.240
in this line of business,

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.080
you should know the limits, right?

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:53.720
You flatter me.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.000
I know a thing or two.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.400
So I have decided

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.360
to gamble with her.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:05.560
Hold on.

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:08.920
Why should women make it hard for women?

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:10.680
I'll take this round.

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.160
That would be a bit fairer.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.080
Fair?

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.520
How can everything in this world

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:17.520
be so fair?

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:20.480
I indeed don't understand Feng Shui, Yin and Yang, or the Five Elements,

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.160
but I am willing to hear your rules.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.360
How about we calculate Feng Shui mantras?

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.520
Pull the strings of my zither based on the mantras.

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:28.560
Whoever gets the most strings

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:29.360
wins.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.640
One hundred and eight strings.

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:31.800
Until they are all cut.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:32.720
In Feng Shui,

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:33.720
Kan (Water) is one,

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:34.520
Kun (Earth) is two,

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.440
Zhen (Wood) is three,

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.440
Xun (Wood) is four,

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:37.920
Central Palace Five Yellow Earth is considered five,

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:38.800
Qian (Metal) is six,

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:39.680
Dui (Metal) is seven,

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:40.520
Gen (Earth) is eight,

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:41.400
Li (Fire) is nine.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.600
If you win,

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.720
I will send you to the top floor.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.480
I have a better proposal.

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:49.400
Let's hear it.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:50.840
Why not

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:52.440
switch to my blade strings?

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.000
Calculate wrong, pull wrong,

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.480
and it will

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:57.480
slice off our fingers.

00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.640
What a ruthless woman.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.040
But I like it.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:05.520
I like it too.

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.160
I like it too.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:12.520
I

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:14.120
like it too.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.040
So, Senior,

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.280
will you value your life and open the door,

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.200
or gamble your hands and life?

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.880
Haven't played this crazily in a long time.

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:26.320
Come on!

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.120
Come on!

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.560
Battalion Commander, you went easy on me.

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.720
Help!

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.080
Why?

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.800
Why is he always one step ahead of me?

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:44.240
Get up.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.560
You're disgracing the Embroidered Uniform Guard and the Minister's Estate.

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:47.160
Let me do it.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:47.880
My lord,

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:49.320
let me do it instead.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.520
You look down on me too?

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.160
No need for you to trouble yourself with such a trifle.

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:55.640
We can't afford to lose another round.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:56.160
I'll do it.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:02.400
Please enlighten me.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.320
Please, my lord.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.120
Flea on a Drum, Shi Qian.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.120
This round tests memory of card positions,

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:32.160
but luck plays a big part.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.400
Be patient.

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.880
Excessive liver fire

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.480
Red eyes and dry tongue

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.040
No

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:53.960
The suit of this card

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.840
Luckily we are playing with only two decks

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:35.280
If there were more

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.360
I really wouldn't be able to stop you from switching cards

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.320
After all, the backs of these two decks are extremely similar

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.000
It's enough to make one go cross-eyed

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.040
For example, this pattern and that pattern

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.600
There's just a tiny extra hook

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.160
This card

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.320
should be Song Jiang

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.120
Sir

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.040
You actually managed to memorize

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.360
the markings on the back of every single card of mine

00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:59.480
However

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.560
you are only the second one today

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.880
Please follow me

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.920
Hai, Ren, Zi, Gui, Northern Water

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.600
Geng, Shen, Xin, You, Qian Metal meets

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.640
Si, Bing, Wu, Ding, Southern Fire

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.960
Chen, Xu, Chou, Wei, Kun-Gen Earth

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.440
It seems you are enjoying yourself, Senior

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.760
Meiren now has one plus four, five sticks in total

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.440
Red Ghost already has seven plus eight, fifteen sticks

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.600
It looks like Green Ghost will be back soon too

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.440
So we must end this quickly

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.440
We absolutely cannot stay at the beginner level

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:56.560
Tang Xi

00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.480
Recite the longest Five Elements mantra for me

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.000
Zi-Chou forms Earth

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.200
Yin-Hai forms Wood

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:04.560
Mao-Xu forms Fire

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:05.760
Chen-You forms Metal

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:06.960
Si-Shen forms Water

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:08.480
Wu-Wei forms Sun and Moon

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:10.360
Hai, Mao, Wei, Qian, Jia, Ding

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.560
Tan Lang walks the path

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.320
Yin, Wu, Xu, Gen, Bing, Xin

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:14.480
Every position is Lian Zhen

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.160
Si, You, Chou, Xun, Geng, Gui

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:17.360
All are Wu Qu positions

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.480
Shen, Zi, Chen, Kun, Ren, Yi

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.080
Wen Qu comes from the start

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:23.760
Senior

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.040
Have you heard the story of the spear and the shield?

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.640
The pupil surpasses the master

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:52.840
Guanyin's six senses are open

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.480
No need to open eyes

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.840
to perceive the suffering of the world

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:57.840
The four of you

00:30:59.240 --> 00:30:59.960
Please

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:34.640
My lords

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.200
Care for a game?

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:37.040
Speak

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.520
Why did you let them in?

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.200
Are you their accomplice?

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.400
Betraying the Eastern Depot?

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.880
Betraying the Eastern Depot?

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.920
I have never served the Eastern Depot

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.440
How can there be betrayal?

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.800
When Eunuch Lord Shang discussed building the pagoda with me

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:50.680
he only said I could meet those with a discerning eye

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.120
He did not say those who pass the test cannot enter

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.160
He did not say those who pass the test cannot enter

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.080
On the contrary, you lot

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.400
can't even figure out the mere Five Elements

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.160
Pestering me here

00:31:58.560 --> 00:31:59.400
Are you going to open the door or not?

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.200
On what grounds?

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.000
On the grounds that I have plenty of bargaining chips

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.160
Bring them up

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:40.560
According to my observation

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:43.520
the door mechanism is opened via the Guanyin statue

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.240
Right now, the Sifang members are inside

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:47.520
The Guanyin statue

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:48.920
is likely on the side of the main hall

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.080
Embroidered Uniform Guard, prepare explosives and protective gear

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:52.520
Since there is no door

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:54.000
blast a door open for me

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.360
This is the Eastern Depot's secret intelligence mechanism

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:15.120
For Shang Hua to hold the position of Eunuch Lord of the Eastern Depot

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:17.360
and stand firm in the imperial court

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.680
he really does have a few tricks up his sleeve

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:27.840
You are not a real high monk

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:29.200
What are you doing?

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:47.840
Secret reports

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:48.680
Secret reports

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:49.360
I can recite them

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:51.440
I can recite them

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.400
I can recite them

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.240
18th year of Chenghua

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.360
fourth day of the fourth month

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.640
the demonic hour of You

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.240
Eastern Depot eunuch

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.120
This is the record of what we have done recently

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:07.600
Meiren

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.560
Go check their mental state and condition quickly

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.680
These people can read characters,

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.720
but they cannot comprehend the meaning.

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:26.800
They look like adults,

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.040
but their behavior

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.320
resembles that of five or six-year-olds.

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.520
But they weren't born this way.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.360
It was caused by poisoning.

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:37.280
That's why they've lost their minds to this extent.

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.280
They can only read silently,

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.800
tools for reciting and memorizing.

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:42.280
There is nothing easier to control

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:44.200
than emotionless, demented living people.

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:45.760
If they are discovered,

00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:47.680
they are simply killed.

00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:48.680
Dying with the secrets,

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:50.360
so no one will ever know.

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.440
If they are found alive,

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.360
one just claims they are demented.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.360
Everything they say

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.400
won't be believed.

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:14.800
You are the steward here.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:22.960
A mute.

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.120
Truly an absolute defense.

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:25.840
No.

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:29.080
I can roughly guess what he means.

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:31.280
He is only responsible for these monks'

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.320
basic daily needs.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:33.760
He ignores everything else.

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:35.400
Master Konghui passed away today.

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:37.160
These people are disguised as monks

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.600
so when the Buddhist relics are enshrined,

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:39.680
no one will be suspicious.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.200
Am I right?

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.240
Raising humans like livestock.

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.720
The Eastern Depot actually committed

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:49.320
such unconscionable acts.

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:50.960
Nominally exposing treacherous officials,

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.880
but in reality, all are unjust cases.

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.240
Eliminating dissidents, murdering the loyal.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.240
After which of their deeds

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:57.880
would they ever show remorse?

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.160
They probably enjoy it instead.

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.520
Under the current circumstances,

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:03.520
we can't take the people with us.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:04.680
The secret reports...

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:06.240
we can't take them all either.

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:11.320
This is a knockout drug.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.440
Blow it in front of all of them,

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.880
and we can take the remaining secret reports.

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.120
Let's split up.

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:17.880
Hurry up.

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:18.840
So many things...

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:19.640
take as much as we can.

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:20.000
Okay.

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:55.680
I've taken a brief look.

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.920
The secret reports here aren't from the Eastern Depot.

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:00.200
Instead, they are investigations into the Western Depot.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:04.880
They must have arrived.

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:05.960
A battle is unavoidable today.

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.280
Remember our agreement.

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:08.080
Do not linger in battle.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:08.720
Do not get killed.

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:09.200
Do not get caught.

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:09.880
You are not allowed to die.

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:10.760
Escape with all your might.

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.000
Especially you, Young Mistress.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:13.560
Don't worry.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:14.840
I'm injured today.

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.600
And I want to stay alive to go home for dinner.

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.360
Then leave it to me for now.

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.200
Be careful, Old Wu.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:29.360
My lords.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.520
What took you so long?

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.160
Wu Qiangu.

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:36.000
Surrender immediately.

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:38.600
Lord Yin.

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:40.480
Leave Yin Feng to me.

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:42.440
You are injured.

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.160
Do you plan to cripple your martial arts to get married?

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:47.240
For a brute like this,

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:48.520
I alone am enough.

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:49.920
Such arrogant words.

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.640
A weak little woman thinks she can contend with me?

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:54.080
It seems this lord...

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:55.920
...is not married yet, right?

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:57.200
How did you know?

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:01.120
It's obvious you've never seen how formidable a woman can be.

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:02.200
You look like a fool.

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.280
You!

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:04.560
Little lunatic.

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.120
We meet again.

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:07.400
Zhang Shaoqing.

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:08.840
It's only been six hours.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:09.960
And you miss me already?

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:12.160
If you want to say something...

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.760
...like "arresting me" or other nonsense,

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:14.960
just save it.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:17.120
It's more satisfying to let our blades do the talking.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.080
You're overthinking it.

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:19.520
I wanted to ask you,

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.120
can your injury withstand my blade?

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:24.080
Have you heard of a scabbard?

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.720
Today I'll capture you, you indecent person.

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:29.120
Everyone, be careful.

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:14.560
You actually didn't fall for the Illusion Magic.

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:22.640
By the way,

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:25.120
your name is Shen Youzhi.

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:28.640
Your Godfather is Shang Hua.

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:30.840
I originally thought

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:34.360
you were a rich playboy born with a silver spoon.

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:35.160
But it turns out,

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.240
you are just a tool cultivated by Shang Hua.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.320
Sorcerer!

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:42.040
Godfather treats me like his own son.

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.040
I won't allow you to sow discord.

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:03.400
Lord Yin.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.600
You've fallen for the Illusion Magic.

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:14.120
I didn't expect the Grand Court of Justice...

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:15.200
...to have such excellent blade skills.

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:17.480
This little woman's swordplay is truly exquisite.

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:18.640
Have you drawn all the moves?

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.400
Rest assured, my lord, I am drawing them.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.360
We can study them together tomorrow.

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:34.800
Me, sowing discord?

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:37.920
What has Shang Hua ever given you?

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.760
He hasn't even given you

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.040
the simplest hug.

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:43.080
Under the banner of "for your own good,"

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:45.800
he arranged everything for you.

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.160
Every decision in your life...

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.120
...which one...

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.560
...did you make yourself?

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:53.320
I am different from them.

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:54.560
These people...

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:56.560
These people...

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:01.160
Compared to them,

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:03.480
you are nothing but

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:06.120
a more expensive puppet.

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:07.880
This time,

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.360
you should thank Wang Zhi.

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.200
For your operation this time,

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:14.840
that old thing Shang Hua...

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:17.680
...will inevitably send his precious godson to gain experience.

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:19.720
When that time comes,

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.560
please look after him, everyone.

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.520
This is Shen Youzhi's secret report.

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.000
Please accept it with my compliments.

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:44.520
My Lord

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.080
These are the children I recently bought.

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:48.160
Their backgrounds

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.320
have been investigated thoroughly.

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:50.640
There will be no future trouble.

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:55.920
The good-looking girls

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.640
will be sent to Blossom Pavilion for training.

00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.640
When they are older,

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:01.440
we will decide where to place them.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.160
Remind Mistress Hua

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:06.480
to replenish the moles in the officials' residences.

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:08.760
Yes, my Lord.

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:10.720
Among these children,

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:12.920
is there anyone to your liking?

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:15.640
Judging by appearance alone,

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.080
how can one distinguish good from bad?

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.880
Whoever can survive for half an incense stick's time,

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:29.880
will be rewarded with two bowls of rice

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:31.840
and thirty taels of silver.

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:33.840
May I choose not to participate?

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:35.040
What?

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:36.960
I've seen gentry raise large dogs like these.

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:38.320
They can rival starving wolves.

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.160
For two bowls of rice and thirty taels of silver,

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:41.280
to risk one's own life...

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:42.080
it is not worth it.

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:44.160
If it could ensure a lifetime of food and clothing,

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:46.000
then it might be worth risking my life.

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:48.000
Whose child is he?

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:48.960
Answering my Lord,

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.560
he is a child of the Shen family.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:55.720
Between you and him,

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:58.120
where would fatherly affection come from?

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:00.000
Do you think you are special?

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:03.040
Wang Zhi didn't just kill a wolf.

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:05.000
He killed all the children too.

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:08.440
You wanted a life of luxury.

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:10.400
He gave you wealth and honor.

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:12.440
Between you two,

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.840
it has always been just a transaction.

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:20.640
Youzhi.

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.200
What books have you been reading lately?

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:24.640
Answering Godfather,

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:26.720
I have been reading *Zuo Zhuan*.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.000
*Selections of Refined Literature*.

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:31.320
*Selections of Refined Literature*, Volume 45.

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:32.800
*Reply to the King of Chu*.

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.640
King Xiang of Chu asked Song Yu:

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.840
"Sir, is there a flaw in your conduct?"

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:41.040
"Why do the common people praise you so little?"

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.720
Song Yu replied:

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:45.600
"Yes, indeed there is."

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.960
"I hope Your Majesty will pardon my offense"

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:49.800
"and allow me to finish my words."

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.760
"A sage has magnificent thoughts and extraordinary conduct,"

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.160
"standing aloof and alone."

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:56.360
"The common people of the world,"

00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:59.240
"how can they understand what I do?"

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:06.840
You have never disappointed me.

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.360
Then do you know

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:10.800
why I named you Youzhi?

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:12.720
The people may be made to follow,

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:14.560
but not to understand.

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:19.000
Shang Hua believes in power.

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:20.320
Power

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:22.920
is everything he wants.

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.200
Shen Youzhi,

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:25.600
you

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:29.120
are the extension of his power and desire.

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:31.200
He only needed to find

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:34.520
someone to perfectly inherit his mantle.

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:37.840
I am not his tool.

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:43.320
But to him, I am more than a transaction.

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:43.920
I...

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:44.600
I...

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:47.800
Who am I?

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:50.880
Wu Qiangu, oh Wu Qiangu.

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:52.720
I am not...

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:56.680
You are truly a sinful person.

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:07.760
Lu Songshi.

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:08.560
Lord Yuan.

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:09.640
What a coincidence.

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.480
In such a life-and-death drama,

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:13.280
why are you so keen on participating?

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:14.680
I don't know either.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.440
Perhaps I am the one chosen by Heaven.

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:19.440
Wrong.

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:23.640
I am the one chosen by Heaven.

00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:26.520
Then Lord Yuan truly has good fortune.

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:32.640
Miss, are you alright?

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:34.480
I'll treat you to roast duck back in the capital.

00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:38.680
Who goes there?

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:40.680
Japanese ninjas.

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:42.800
Japanese people?

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:43.720
Eunuch Lord Wang's secret guards.

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:45.280
My mission is to monitor Shen Youzhi and Zhang Yi.

00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:46.000
Hurry up and leave!

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:46.560
Go, go, go!

00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:00.040
Don't think you can escape!

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.440
Why are you fine?

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:03.200
Because I'm immune to poison.

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:22.960
Let's go!
