00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.140
I wish I had a friend who’s an artist

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.200
Then… how about I be your friend?

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.250
Being my friend

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.910
isn’t that easy, you know.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.350
My parents they don’t want me associating with people who aren’t famous

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.920
I’m gonna go get something to eat

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.310
By the indie cinema

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.320
but you can’t really come with me, can you?

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.410
Why wouldn’t I be able to go with you?

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.990
Actors are people too, you know

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.140
Then hurry and get changed

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.140
So we can go

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.070
Thank you

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.510
Hey

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.390
sorry to trouble you

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.380
What trouble

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.560
Well

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.220
just simple one-dish meals like this

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.280
Oh, come on

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.430
I’m just a normal person

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.000
I’m totally fine

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.490
Oh

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.680
I just realized today

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.490
how much trouble fame can be.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.970
Take your mask off

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.330
Oh

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.080
I totally forgot.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.810
That’s way better

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:57.530
Come on

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.200
Being famous isn’t always a bad thing

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.870
It gives you a lot of good things too

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.580
Like...

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.300
Like

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:09.470
money

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.990
I can draw ten paintings

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.330
It still doesn’t make as much as one event for you

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:17.920
Do you know

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.000
what I had to trade for it?

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:27.840
What?

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.540
I live off my fame

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.180
paid for by the public’s affection

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.320
If that’s what the public wants

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.860
that’s what I have to be

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.930
that’s what I have to be

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.110
Because everything

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.650
Aren’t you taking this too seriously?

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:53.050
But actually

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.160
my family is rich

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.640
I don’t know…

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.490
why I would need so much money.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.620
Hey

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.150
You can’t think like that.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.480
Earning our own money

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.430
gives us freedom.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.690
No one can judge us

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:12.590
You’re right

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.610
Let’s go eat

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.450
Let’s do it!

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.800
Wow… this looks insanely good

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.600
You really can eat this?

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.040
Sure

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.230
Come on,

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.360
I’ll serve you

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.910
Do you like chicken?

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:41.700
Want my chicken?

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.560
NO

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.220
You go ahead and eat

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.040
Eat up

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.300
I want some too

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.200
I’m hungry

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:58.820
Okay

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:02.580
Hmm.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.710
Sorry

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.550
we’re closed now

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.880
Okay

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:59.200
Huh?

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.450
Then I’ll

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.080
… go back

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:09.780
Okay

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.350
Wait..

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.550
I’ll make one for you

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.010
but

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.020
it won’t be coffee

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:20.260
I’ve already

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.210
cleaned the coffee machine

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.060
So

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.040
whatever

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.080
you want to make for me

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:30.930
Okay

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.450
Then

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.130
please wait a moment.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:04.280
Here

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.440
I made this just for you

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:14.180
Thank you

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:26.890
It's good

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.850
But

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:32.800
I need to close the shop now

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:50.850
May I lock the door?

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:52.460
Meen

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:53.830
are you ready?

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:55.300
Yes

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.030
Sorry

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:00.420
I....

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:01.480
already have an appointment

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.620
Damnnn

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.370
I haven’t even started

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:13.890
This one,two seats, please

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:18.300
The screen’s right here

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.000
You can pick your seats

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:23.410
Wait…

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.060
is this a special seat?

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.420
These are Honeymoon Seats here

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:34.620
Okay, I’ll take this

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:37.680
Because I…

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.370
want to honeymoon with my boyfriend

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.220
How could you say that?

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.000
Why?

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.190
Why are you scared?

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:52.230
No one knows us

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:53.110
I mean…

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.210
there are a lot of people here

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:58.530
Hey… don’t worry

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.290
No one can see my face

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:01.570
I’ve got a mask on, see?

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.220
Okay

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:08.270
Thank you

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.420
Let’s go

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.580
Is the movie good?

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.200
I don’t know

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:38.960
I just know that… it’s warm

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:41.780
You...

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:43.050
What are you saying?

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.230
I mean… it’s actually warm

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.390
it’s because you’re touching

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:48.430
butt

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:51.480
Hey

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.830
Why are you being like this?

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:54.390
Ouch, that hurts

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:58.570
Take your jacket back

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:03.860
Don’t get me wrong

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:06.390
I’m just worried people will notice my partner shaking

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:08.790
will notice my partner shaking

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:13.100
I didn’t say anything

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.580
Why are you getting all shy?

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:18.130
Like you’re afraid people

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:19.510
might see your soft side

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:29.680
You sure talk a lot

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.750
I’m good at more than just talking

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:41.410
I believe you

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:51.120
Hey,stop

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:53.830
You

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:54.440
What?

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.440
Not now

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.280
There are too many people around

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:00.600
It’s fine

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:02.690
You

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:03.350
What?

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:06.530
Here

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:08.190
Oh, you

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.050
You

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:11.030
That’s enough

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:13.020
Enough of what, huh?

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:14.260
It’s crowded

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.040
Okay… I won’t do it

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:50.000
You

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.470
Let’s take a shower

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:22.610
Thank You

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:45.430
For the last two days,

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:49.650
I’ve had no idea… who I am

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.030
From a life that was all about drawing

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:55.980
With a cup of coffee worth barely ten baht

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.760
And then, someone came along

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:05.990
and made me laugh

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.750
And made me almost forget

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.050
that I was once alone

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:14.980
I didn’t know

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:15.690
that this was love.

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:17.950
Or… is it just a crush?

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:21.160
But one thing I do know

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.120
it makes my hear

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.280
Beat faster than ever

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.470
If tomorrow… everything changes

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.450
Will I still be smiling?

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:47.540
For now,

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:50.910
I’ll keep all of this as a memory.

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:49.920
It smells so good

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.640
Would you like to eat now?

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:57.090
Is it ready?

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:03.050
Come on… I’m hungry

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:04.810
Okay

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:07.339
Let me help

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:08.599
Thank You

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.900
I like my fried eggs well done with chili sauce

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:26.450
He’s pretty fit

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.830
But… I like everything about what you do

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:37.080
Thank You

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.030
At first

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.610
I thought you liked your fried eggs runny

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.460
Let’s eat

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:47.380
Umm

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:44.120
I wanna eat you.

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.300
If you really wanted me

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:54.820
then...

00:19:57.410 --> 00:19:58.780
why did you fall asleep last night?

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:06.350
Hey

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:08.820
Eat lots of tomatoes

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:09.320
Believe Me..

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:14.080
Thank You

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.380
You

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:20.380
Can I talk to you about the exhibition?

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.740
So

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:28.530
In two months from now

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:31.360
I’ll have less free time

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.320
I’ll probably have to redraw everything

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:36.040
I might have to move closer to the studio

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:39.410
I probably won’t be home that often

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.320
it’s okay

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.930
Then I’ll go to the studio and see you

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:50.000
That’s not what I mean

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:52.310
So..

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:54.100
What I meant was...

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:01.460
I just want you to

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:03.340
It’s time to get serious about filming with me

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:10.000
If you want to train me in anything…

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:15.850
You can start training me

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:20.510
Because

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.680
you’re going to be busy soon

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:26.020
If we wait, we might never get to start filming

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:32.940
Okey

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:35.500
I get it

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.190
About tomorrow’s party

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:48.430
so you’re coming with me, right?

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:49.750
Yes

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:52.350
So..Tonight

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.050
stay with me tonight, okay?

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:56.250
Okey

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.350
I’ll get this done quickly.

00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:59.520
I’m done

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:03.230
I’ll pack my things and stay over at your place

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.430
So..See you tonight

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.240
See you

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:46.920
Khun Sasom

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:49.130
Your father would like to meet with you

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:53.650
Wait

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:01.730
Do you know what it’s about?

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:03.130
I think...

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.650
It’s most likely about the Brand Ambassador deal

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.360
K.Long Airline

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:39.800
Did you know?

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:42.270
The peach is often used as a symbol of relationships

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:43.650
that must be hidden

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.740
a smooth, soft exterior

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:52.640
lusciously sweet

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.870
Like the beautiful image seen by everyone

00:23:56.790 --> 00:24:00.000
Yet inside, a hard seed is hidden

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:01.660
Like a hidden secret

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:03.400
that cannot be shown to anyone

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.540
And sometimes…

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:07.350
The difference between the sweet, tender peel

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:10.000
and the hardened seed

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:11.860
And so, the peach becomes

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.100
becomes the most complete fruit

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:14.860
Within that relationship…

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.100
My café is open for coffee lovers.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.210
It’s not a place for bodyguards to hang around

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:07.680
I'm just

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:09.290
I really want some coffee

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.770
So, would you like today?

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:16.920
Latte

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.630
Americano

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:22.440
Or would you like the special I made just for you?

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:35.650
My own special

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:36.980
Here

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.320
What?

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.990
You’re looking at me like I’m a celebrity

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:44.790
I just think

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:48.640
you’re really good at making coffee.

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.180
You just won’t admit it, will you?

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:55.960
So… are you here for the coffee

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.580
or the barista?

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.460
Hey

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:57.460
Weren’t you going to get the wedding invitation with Pin?

00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:59.460
Why are you still here?

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:00.500
What?

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:13.490
Where did you even get these photos?

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:14.960
Dad's Staff

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:17.470
So, have Mom and Dad seen these already?

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.750
I got hold of them first

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:21.750
But I can only do this for so long

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.860
I'm sorry

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:29.340
I can only help this much

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:31.050
You don’t need to say sorry

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:32.420
This is good enough

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:34.570
So I can realize it early.

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:38.870
If you hadn’t insisted on marrying Pin…

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.290
You wouldn’t have to deal with all this.

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:41.160
Because of me

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:10.000
Hi , Dad

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:10.850
Hi , Mom

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.900
So you still think of me as your mother?

00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:16.860
So,

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:18.640
Happy now?

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:20.550
that you’ve embarrassed me?

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:23.340
What are you embarrassed about?

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:25.340
Don’t mess with me.

00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:28.250
Do you know how much you embarrassed me

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:30.780
by turning Uncle Long down like that?

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.200
I just didn’t want to do it.

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.970
Uncle Long’s airline is really bad

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:37.730
Why would I risk the image I worked so hard

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:39.710
to build for a terrible business?

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:40.210
Do you know

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:41.970
who Uncle Long’s son-in-law is?

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:44.640
He’s helped us so many times.

00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:47.650
Do you have no gratitude whatsoever?

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:49.020
Huh?

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:50.640
I don’t think

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:52.400
I’m the one who owes him anything

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:55.500
It’s you and Dad who owe him

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.730
You!

00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:58.160
This is too much, Dad

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.430
And who told you to argue with us like this?

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:03.040
Dad

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:17.350
Do it, or don’t. Which is it?

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.550
And what do I get out of this?

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.130
If you become the Brand Ambassador

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.760
I’ll give you the Tonnam's address

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.200
Mom, where did you get that?

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:38.320
But if you say no…

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.040
You’ll never get to see Ton Nam for the rest of your life.

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:48.220
So…

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.380
this is what you give me.

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:28.380
want you to remember this, Lek.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.550
That you’ve completely ruined my life.

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:34.310
and you

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:37.100
killed me inside

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.530
What the hell happened, Lek?

00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:52.250
Nothing’s wrong

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:55.970
They just asked me to do something

00:30:58.170 --> 00:30:59.240
But it’s not a big deal.

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:02.350
Lek

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:05.190
I’m asking you seriously.

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:08.940
Have you ever truly been happy

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:10.410
living in this house?

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:15.840
Now do you understand?

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:20.770
Why I needs Peach Lover as a place to hide

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:38.100
somtime...

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:41.280
Maybe my safe place

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.600
isn’t Peach Lover

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:46.510
It was Po

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:45.330
Who?

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:52.630
Sasom

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:07.340
Is something wrong?

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:13.180
I’m feeling stressed

00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:18.660
Is it about work?

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:34.750
So...

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:38.990
It’s about my family

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:46.940
If I tell you…

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.310
will you help me with everything?

00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.070
Of course

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:10.239
Then

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:22.710
Call me 'Daddy'

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:27.090
wait..

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.350
Is roleplay your way of dealing with stress?

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:35.060
I told you

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:38.870
say 'Daddy'

00:34:43.469 --> 00:34:44.389
Yes...Dad

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.179
I wasn’t here today

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:52.250
Have you been a good boy?

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.199
Today

00:34:58.070 --> 00:34:59.720
I’ve done something bad today, Dad.

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.670
What did you do?

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:07.500
I jack off in Dad's bath

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.070
You’re selfish

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.600
How can you be happy alone

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:18.520
Sorry dad...

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:21.370
Sorry isn't enough

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:25.180
You have to be punished.

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:33.850
Sorry, we’re closed

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:35.690
You’re here to charm me into making you coffee again, huh?

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:38.510
I just want to try the coffee you make

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:41.330
How about I help you close up?

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:48.570
Okay, fine

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:42.590
I’ve never done this with anyone before

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:48.010
I

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:48.880
never thought

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:50.950
I’d do something like this with you

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:54.490
So

00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:57.440
Would you let me take care of you?

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:15.490
Okay

00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:46.300
I shouldn't forget my iPad here

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:58.230
Sorry

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000
I made you suffer

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:03.690
It's okay

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:05.820
I'm not in a hurry

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.270
I don't have anywhere else to go

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:10.000
but

00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:12.670
I feel guilty

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:15.440
You must be tired of bringing me back

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:17.770
I forgot that

00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:19.380
t I have a deadline today

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:22.510
Don't worry

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.870
I'm not tired

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:28.980
To be honest,

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.600
I didn't think I would feel this

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:39.490
What kind?

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:41.670
Nomally

00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:44.300
I live alone

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.490
Even though I have work,

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:50.200
there are people around me.

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:52.460
But when I came back to home

00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:54.630
there's no one

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.110
No one asked me

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:00.810
Do I feel okay?

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:13.360
Me too

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:17.460
I've been through a lot in my life

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:22.170
Until I thought that being alone would be safer

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:25.630
No one needs to see me when I'm in trouble

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:31.580
but now

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:34.380
I met you

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:37.160
be with you

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:43.160
I didn't feel like I had to carry anything

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:50.260
Thank you PO

00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:55.030
Do you...do you want it?

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:13.180
The two of us

00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:15.070
have already fallen out

00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:24.500
It's because of you.

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:50.990
Don't go anywhere

00:47:56.350 --> 00:47:57.850
Stay with me tonight

00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:45.790
You'r mine

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.050
This Ngern , He's Sasom's brother

00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:40.200
Hello

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:45.120
You're PO?

00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:50.610
Yes

00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:23.860
What kind of crazy thing is this?

00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:24.830
I never thought

00:50:24.830 --> 00:50:25.910
my little brother would be like this

00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:26.790
Seems like

00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:29.120
Sasom found the right person

00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:30.620
You’re awake?

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:32.630
I wanted to wake up early just to see your face

00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:37.600
What the hell did you talk to him about?

00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:39.500
Your dad is really sick, man

00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:41.670
I heard it’s stage three cancer

00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:43.650
It’s okay

00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:45.740
I'm here
