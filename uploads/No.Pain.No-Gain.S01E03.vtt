00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:12.740
Hi...

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.300
Hi, Mr. Pei.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:15.900
I'm Ruan Guangjian.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.550
I'm an art major.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.270
I've also done some concept art before.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.950
I'm not Mr. Pei.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.830
I'm Mr. Ma,
who contacted you before this.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.350
This is Mr. Pei.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.830
You...

00:02:27.791 --> 00:02:29.635
Sorry about that, Mr. Pei.

00:02:29.635 --> 00:02:31.110
My nearsightedness is 1400 degrees,

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.519
and my astigmatism is 200 degrees.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.800
I can't see without my glasses.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:34.830
That's fine.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.140
You're Ruan Guangjian, right?

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.830
That's right.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.420
With your eyesight,

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.830
how do you usually draw?

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.830
I can draw if I zoom in 500%.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.420
Let me show you my artwork.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.670
Mr. Pei,

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.550
he draws everything
in a cute and stylized theme.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.110
It doesn't fit

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.270
Divine General Pact's style.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.510
That's precisely what we need.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.550
How much do you charge per project?

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.510
1,000 yuan for 1 character.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.950
1,000 yuan?

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.270
Isn't that cheap labor?

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.990
Ma Yang,

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.950
at Tengda, we respect
the creators the most.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.510
Give him triple the pay.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.110
Alright.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:29.550
Triple?

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.990
Have I been selected?

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.160
But you guys haven't
told me your requirements yet.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.950
Why don't you start
by telling us what you want?

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.830
We are the service providers.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.230
We'll listen to the clients' demands.

00:03:44.302 --> 00:03:46.550
(First Draft Pass)
We're still in a very lowly position.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:48.550
Judging from that,

00:03:48.568 --> 00:03:50.700
I'm sure your clients
must've been tough on you all.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.550
Don't worry.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.110
Tengda isn't a client

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.591
that'll interfere with your work.

00:03:54.613 --> 00:03:56.830
We'll leave the professional work
to professionals like you.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.860
No matter what you draw,

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.270
we'll make sure

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.550
your first draft will pass.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.350
Ma Yang, we'll take him.

00:04:10.902 --> 00:04:12.013
First draft pass, okay?

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.940
I guess I can draw these too
if I practice enough.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.260
Mr. Pei.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.420
This is next month's personnel expenses

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.030
and project budget.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:55.500
Don't start a fight!

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.990
Bao, come and save me.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.380
How? I'm almost dead myself.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.550
Bao, you have to save me.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.500
I lost again.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.746
Look at this Pineapple Head.

00:05:02.746 --> 00:05:04.500
He even designed
a pair of glasses for us.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.990
Huang, help me check it out.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.060
See if this Pineapple Head will work.

00:05:08.213 --> 00:05:09.740
I told you not to start a fight, right?

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.300
Did Mr. Pei entrust the project to you?

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.420
With great power
comes great responsibility.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.990
Yun,

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.060
our labor costs this month are too high.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.300
We can talk about it tomorrow.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.060
I need to pick up
my kid from school later.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.060
Yintang, what should I buy for you?

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.500
Look at this.

00:05:27.591 --> 00:05:29.420
What do you think about
the color combination?

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.420
My goodness. That's pretty good.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.990
Of course.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.990
It'll be better if you make
the background green.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.990
Okay?

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.620
Okay.

00:05:51.613 --> 00:05:53.500
You swapped the light bulbs
at your home again.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.420
When will it end?

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.670
Mr. Pei, I told you already.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.990
Personal items

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.620
cannot be reimbursed as office supplies.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.480
It doesn't comply with
the terms of cooperation.

00:06:03.568 --> 00:06:05.940
You can't just spend
all your time trying to find loopholes.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.260
Ms. Xin, you see,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.300
I only make 5,000 yuan per month.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.820
There's nothing I can do

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.435
after paying the rent every month.

00:06:16.746 --> 00:06:17.180

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.160
You're trying to get reimbursed
for two screwdrivers.

00:06:19.168 --> 00:06:20.080
You went overboard.

00:06:20.102 --> 00:06:21.500
You're the one going overboard here.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.500
You won't even let 12.50 slide.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:26.500
Come in.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:27.740
Mr. Pei,

00:06:27.768 --> 00:06:29.860
Ruan has sent us the draft
for Divine General Pact.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:30.860
Take a look.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.420
Sibo and Lv are also making progress.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.060
Ruan did a great job.

00:06:39.568 --> 00:06:41.740
I can tell
that he didn't put in a lot of effort.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:43.940
What do you guys think?

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.180
Bao Xu and I thought
that Ruan did a great job as well.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.060
If you guys think it's great,

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.680
my opinion doesn't matter anymore.

00:06:49.702 --> 00:06:51.620
We promised to let him pass
with the first draft.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:52.860
We should keep our promise.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.060
Alright, I'll tell him about it.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.389
Oh, the beta version has already

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:57.546
been uploaded to our group chat.

00:06:57.546 --> 00:06:58.568

Ma Yang,

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.180
what's with all the gift packs?

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.860
My phone is lagging because of them.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.180
Weren't you the one who said it?

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.740
We should give the players
as many gift packs as possible.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.060
I have a suggestion.

00:07:35.102 --> 00:07:36.860
We've been rushing
to meet deadlines lately.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.060
This project has been tough on everyone.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.180
I suggest

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.990
we hold a teambuilding event.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.860
A teambuilding event?

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.300
Let's go overseas,
to a place like the Maldives.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.060
That sounds great.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.300
What about Monaco?

We can't go overseas?

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.860
What about local places, then?

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.620
We can visit
other companies in the industry

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.990
to learn, exchange ideas, and discuss
business opportunities with them.

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.500
That's viable, right?

If we want to do something like this,

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.900
we should make sure
it's different from our competitors.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.559

a marketing gimmick

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.660
Lin Wan, that's a great idea.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.020
But it definitely won't
pass the evaluation.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:35.260
Have a seat.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.380
Listen to me.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.900
How can you validate with the boss

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.070
something that doesn't exist

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:40.900
on the market yet?

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.590
The market is retrospective.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.657
We believe too much in data.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:45.789
That's why we've been cloning

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:47.720
the successful games
that are already on the market

00:10:47.724 --> 00:10:49.035
and parroting other people's ideas.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.780
Mr. Zhou has already
approved of the proposal.

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:54.900
You should stop causing
additional trouble.

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.900
I know your revised proposal
is good and innovative,

00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.660
but it's too costly.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.346
Do you think
Mr. Zhou will approve of it?

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:02.660
Wait, you...

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:04.590
Come.

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:05.350
Stand up.

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:10.470
Take a look.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.380
All of us are merely employees.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.140
We're just making a living.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.380
And, other video game companies

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:21.900
are doing the same thing, aren't they?

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:23.140
But I...

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:27.380
Relax, okay?

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.660
With Lin Wan's identity,

00:11:37.013 --> 00:11:38.380
it'll be hard to get rid of her.

00:11:39.502 --> 00:11:40.660
Let's leave it aside first.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:43.020
Remove her from the name list.

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:46.110
If anyone asks about it,

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:49.260
tell them that her overtime
work performance was outstanding.

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:50.900
Understood.

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.260
Mr. Zhou, there's one more thing.

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.020
There's a company called Tengda.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.020
They're requesting
paid visits to our company.

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:01.590
Tengda?

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.780
It's the company that made
The Lonely Road.

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:05.380
It's them?

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.546
I thought visiting major companies

00:12:07.568 --> 00:12:09.740
should be something organized
by schools for college students

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:11.380
as part of their
social practice activities.

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:13.590
They actually came
all the way to Xinyang.

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:14.740
And, a paid visit too?

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:15.820
They're burning money here.

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.780
It's a startup.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.380
I think the company owner

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.350
doesn't know how to show their investors
where the money is being spent.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.350
They only request a one-day visit.

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:28.350
They'll leave by Sunday.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:33.380
Tell Lin Wan.

00:12:33.613 --> 00:12:35.110
Let her take charge of the visit.

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:36.470
She should stay busy.

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:39.140
She's making too many suggestions
in the planning department.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:40.350
Alright.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:47.060
(Xinyang Airlines)

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.350
Mr. Zhou is too courteous.

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:54.260
We were the ones visiting Sky Fire,

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:55.780
but he instructed you to receive us.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:57.660
Sorry for the trouble.

00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:58.590
It's part of my duty.

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:00.900
Mr. Zhou is taking
Tengda's trip very seriously.

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.457
He hopes that it can lay the foundation
for future cooperation.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.020
This seat can be reclined.

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:08.230
It's fine. Thank you.

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:09.660
It's fine.

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:10.470
Just lie down.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:12.140
Mr. Pei,

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:14.260
besides visiting Sky Fire,

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.835
we have also arranged some activities.

00:13:15.835 --> 00:13:17.660
Can we request Ms. Lin to join us?

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:19.900
Yeah, you should join us.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.140
Mr. Pei will definitely
reimburse you for it. Don't worry.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:23.020
Mr. Pei?

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.140
Of course.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:27.260
It's fine. I'll join you guys
for the other activities.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.590
I won't join your teambuilding event.

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:30.470
It's inconvenient.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:32.790
Didn't Mr. Zhou instruct you
to join us for the entire visit?

00:13:32.791 --> 00:13:33.880
You should join us.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.124
Treat it as part of your job.

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:40.140
Now that we're visiting Sky Fire,

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.350
it'll undoubtedly be of great help

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:43.470
to my future work at Tengda.

We've obtained the license
for Divine General Pact.

It'll be officially launched
on the 29th of the month.

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:51.260
Is that so, Ms. Xin?

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.350
Amazing. That was quick.

00:15:53.391 --> 00:15:55.140
I merely followed
Mr. Pei's instructions.

00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:58.380
Mr. Pei, (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.380
and now, we're on a study tour.

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:02.250
We've achieved a balance
between work and life.

00:16:02.257 --> 00:16:03.620
Isn't this great?

00:16:03.724 --> 00:16:05.099
On the 29th of the month?

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.380
We don't have much time left.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.500
Mr. Pei, there are plenty of details
I need to edit...

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:09.260
Sibo.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.260
You mustn't do so.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.380
We're able to launch our game in advance

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.900
because our game

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:15.780
is already perfect.

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.500
And, we're here on a study tour.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.380
You mustn't think about work again.

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.620
Mr. Pei is right.

00:16:21.635 --> 00:16:23.070
The idea of Divine General Pact alone

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:24.260
is enough to make it a top game.

00:16:24.324 --> 00:16:25.770
Moreover, in the grand scheme of things,

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:26.991
someone is bound to help us out.

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:28.780
Yeah, right?

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.020
From now on,

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:32.900
we'll officially lie flat!

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:33.350
Alright!

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:34.020
Let's lie flat.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.780
Time to relax.

00:16:36.124 --> 00:16:37.635
Huang, I'll go and take some food.

00:16:37.635 --> 00:16:38.470
You can lie down.

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.140
No, you should lie down.

00:16:40.168 --> 00:16:41.946
Lying down while eating
promotes digestion.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:48.140
This won't do.
I should edit them somehow.

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:51.740
The weather on the coast
is so unpredictable.

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:53.260
The sky will clear up later.

00:16:54.168 --> 00:16:55.860
I bet tomorrow's weather will be clear.

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.380
They don't seem like
they're here on a business trip.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.190
So, this is how Tengda works.

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:16.430
Mr. Pei, I'm having trouble adjusting
to the new environment.

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:18.300
I want to rest in the hotel.

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:19.870
You guys can enjoy yourselves.

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:30.300
Huang.

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:33.020
Huang?

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:34.580
Huang,

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:35.780
time's up.

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.060
Let's go. Time to go down.

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:39.820
Huang, time to go.

00:17:39.857 --> 00:17:41.470
I've already applied for leave
from Mr. Pei.

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:42.390
I don't feel too good.

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:43.630
You guys can go ahead.

00:17:44.035 --> 00:17:46.368
Why are you playing with your laptop
when you're sick?

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.430
Buddy, we're here to have fun.

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:50.150
Stop working overtime.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.060
Didn't Mr. Pei say that Divine General
Pact would be launched soon

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:58.300
and told you not to do anything?

00:17:58.300 --> 00:17:59.230
Let's go.

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.230
It's precisely because
it's going to be launched

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:03.391
that I think I should
optimize it even further.

00:18:03.391 --> 00:18:04.670
Mr. Pei gives me a high wage.

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:06.680
Even our teambuilding event
is this fancy, you know?

00:18:06.746 --> 00:18:07.880
I have to work harder.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.340

that I'm working overtime here.

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:49.060
Our company is treating us very well.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:51.150
I should contribute
to the company somehow.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:58.230
You know this, too.

00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:59.540
I'm a homebody.

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.100
I don't really like to go outside.

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.300
I'll stay here and test the demo.

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.340
Sure. Thanks, Bao.

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:06.300
I'm just doing my job.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.820

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:46.390
I didn't sleep well last night.

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:47.470
Let me take a nap.

How could that be?

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:50.390
You slept so early last night.

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:58.910
We mustn't let Mr. Pei
know that I'm here.

your successful scheme.

Ms. Xin,

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:21.150
aren't you hot?

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:23.630
I feel cold.

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:30.150
Mr. Pei, you told Wu Sheng and Wu Xi
to plan our schedule.

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:32.150
You didn't expect them
to choose Sky Fire, right?

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:34.950
Within your
Fuhui Job-Security Survival Manual,

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:36.910
you criticized Sky Fire a lot.

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:38.150
Ms. Xin,

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:40.470
sometimes, having a great memory

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:42.150
might not be a good thing, you know?

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:45.190
Do you think the people in
Sky Fire will recognize you?

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:49.470
They never look down.

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.280
They definitely
won't be able to recognize me.

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:57.710
Wu Sheng, Wu Xi.

00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:59.150

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:01.190

- Thanks!

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:12.260
That's huge.

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:17.500

How is it tough on her?

00:23:32.257 --> 00:23:33.924
Did she get tired
from standing too long?

00:23:33.924 --> 00:23:35.150
Do you think she can finish this?

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:37.540
Ma Yang, you're now
one of our executives.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:39.540
You need to be more open-minded.

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:42.260
You have no compassion for me at all.

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:48.670

It's huge!

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:52.020
Can you hold it?

it's basically settled.

They all left during

Therefore, we don't need
to compensate them.

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:16.020
I heard from them

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:17.340
that our workstation was tiny.

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:40.780
with the department leaders easily.

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:42.500
Perhaps she's too young.

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.820
She's very obsessed with
her dreams and ideas.

She won't stay
an employee forever anyway.

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:52.230
You should think about

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:54.670

Not only will it not
affect their relationship,

but it can also change
Lin Wan's initial goals.

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:41.740
Are they treating Sky Fire
as their training ground?

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:45.340
Linking up with Shenhua's network

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:47.630
will bring us immense benefits.

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:48.910
Therefore,

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.390
Lin Wan can choose
to leave of her own accord,

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:54.500
but she mustn't be sacked.

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:58.020
But how can we convince her to resign?

00:30:58.300 --> 00:30:59.340
To put it nicely,

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:01.230
she's an idealist.

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:03.230
To put it bluntly,
she's just plain stubborn.

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:05.950
That's simple.

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:08.300
Just show her the truth of the world.

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:10.780
No matter how good an idea is,

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:14.060
without cash flow and profits,
it's all just empty talk.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.570
Grown-ups like us
stopped dreaming long ago.

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:18.950
Now, the only things we do

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:21.740
are meticulous deals.

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:30.380
(Sky Fire Tower)

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:38.710
Our friends from Tengda,

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:40.150
welcome to Sky Fire.

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:41.710
Mr. Zhou is waiting inside.

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:42.430
Please. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:47.546
Listen, Sky Fire is amazing.

00:31:47.546 --> 00:31:49.124
They're ranked first, you know?

00:31:49.124 --> 00:31:49.702
Is that so?

00:31:49.702 --> 00:31:50.670
What do they excel at?

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:51.540
So what?

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:52.870
They're nothing compared to Tengda.

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:53.340
Welcome to Sky Fire.

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:55.430
Yeah. We'll die from
over-exhaustion if we work here.

00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:58.710
Mr. Zhou.

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.990
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:12.950
Mr. Zhou, do you know me?

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:24.710
Mr. Pei, you're young and talented.

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:26.190
I heard from my PA

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:27.470
that you once worked for Fuhui.

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:29.710
But I'm sorry.

00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:32.190
Although Sky Fire operates under Fuhui,

00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:34.710
I don't recognize most of the people

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:37.190
at HQ.

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:40.430
Mr. Zhou, you're a busy man.

00:32:40.502 --> 00:32:42.190
It's normal for you to forget about me.

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:43.430
Let me introduce him.

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:45.190
This is our VP, Zhao Xuming.

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:49.500
This is Lin Wan.
I'm sure you guys know her well.

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:50.950
You guys can go ahead.

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:52.470
I have other things to attend to.

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:53.740
Feel free to tour around.

00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:59.390
Lin Wan, you should go, too.

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:00.670
Prepare the meeting room.

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:01.950
I'll take them around.

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:04.390
Okay, Mr. Zhao.

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:08.190
Everyone, follow me.

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:19.150
It seems
Zhou Muyan didn't recognize you.

00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:20.740
I thought he would.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.500
Sky Fire isn't that big of a deal.

00:33:24.902 --> 00:33:26.710
But everyone in the video game industry

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:27.990
takes them as their role model.

00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:29.359
Fuhui regards them highly as well.

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:30.470
They built a new building for them

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:31.670
even though land
is expensive in Xinyang.

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:33.910
I've played some of their games before.

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:36.190
There's no substance at all.

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:37.390
I don't even want to play them.

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:39.430
Their equipment
is their only redeeming quality.

00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:40.746
I suppose they're quite advanced.

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:44.190
Could you differentiate
between Mr. Zhou and Mr. Zhao?

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:46.430
I think
the good-looking one is Mr. Zhou.

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:47.950
Good-looking?

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:50.430
That mister was pretty good-looking.

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:51.990
Yeah, right?

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:55.230
This is the Planning Department.

00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:57.740
Sky Fire emphasizes creativity.

00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:00.710
The Planning Department
represents our brain.

00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:03.670
Would I be sitting here

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:05.170
had I passed the interview back then?

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:06.950
Bo, you should stay, then.

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:08.180
That won't do.

00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:14.390
Guys,

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:16.990
someone should water this plant.

00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:18.430
It contains life too.

00:34:19.368 --> 00:34:20.950
Someone should water that plant as well.

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.430
There's another team here.

00:34:27.857 --> 00:34:28.950
Sky Fire is huge indeed.

00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:30.660
This is where the art team works.

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:33.270
We place great emphasis on
our game's art design.

00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:35.620
All of the equipment here
are the latest models.

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:42.470
Huang,

00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:44.500
this graphic tablet

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:46.310
is the same as the one we used.

00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:48.220
I think our PCs are superior to theirs.

00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:51.470
I know Fuhui has
tight control over its budget.

00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:53.430
But that shouldn't be
the case for Sky Fire.

00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:57.700
This is our recreation area.

00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:00.470
We have entertainment facilities,
gym, and all kinds of facilities.

00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:05.430
That's the pantry.

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.413
(Limited Quantities)
If our employees are tired,

00:35:07.435 --> 00:35:08.950
they can come and relax here.

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:10.430
Relax?

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:11.620
This is such a dated console.

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:14.220
It's more tiring to play it.

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:16.750
Bao,

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:18.310
it's covered with dust.

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:19.990
Look.

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:21.990
I can finish all these snacks alone.

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:23.950
"Limited Quantities"? Geez.

00:35:24.591 --> 00:35:26.430
I suppose the company
spent all its money

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:28.140
trying to keep up on appearances.

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:29.580
The employees have no benefits at all.

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:30.700
This is a scam.

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:33.060
Lower your volume.

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:35.430
This place is even better
than my previous company.

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.220
(Limited Quantities)

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:49.270
Mr. Pei, over here, please.

00:35:55.591 --> 00:35:57.680
Can't you see
that someone's visiting our company?

00:35:58.102 --> 00:36:00.213
You shouldn't drop the ball
at this crucial moment.

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:01.220
Hurry up.

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:02.950
Hurry.

00:36:05.191 --> 00:36:07.480
Ma Yang, you shouldn't just
focus on criticizing them.

00:36:07.502 --> 00:36:08.830
You have to ask them more questions.

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:09.750
If not, it'll be awkward.

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:11.220
Ask them questions?

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:11.830
Okay.

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:13.750
Mr. Zhao.

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:15.620
You see, today is Saturday.

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:17.413
We were thinking
that we should visit the place

00:36:17.413 --> 00:36:19.020
without bothering anyone
with their work.

00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:19.960
But when we came here,

00:36:19.968 --> 00:36:22.324
we saw so many people
still working here on Saturday.

00:36:27.857 --> 00:36:29.910
Working overtime is fine.
At least you'll get paid.

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:32.700
No. They work overtime voluntarily.

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:34.390
It's an adaptive 9-9-6 schedule.

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:35.700
(Sky Fire Tower)

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:37.768
(Does that mean they don't need
to pay them for overtime?)

00:36:37.791 --> 00:36:39.450
(That can't be.)

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:40.970
(Their workstation is tiny.)

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:42.191
(The chairs are lousy too.)

00:36:45.191 --> 00:36:45.990
Hello, everyone.

00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:49.140
I'm Wei Dongli of Sky Fire.

00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:51.350
It's my honor to be here

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:52.540
to discuss

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:55.660
the charm and challenges
of the video game industry.

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:58.310
As a top-tier game studio
in the industry,

00:36:58.310 --> 00:36:59.470
Sky Fire has three missions

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:01.270
to accomplish.

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:04.620
Firstly, it's to connect
the past and the future,

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:06.830
strengthen our awareness,
and proceed with self-iteration.

00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:09.660
Secondly, it's to focus on
integrating industry and individuals,

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:10.790
leveraging market data

00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:12.540
to refine industry segmentation,

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:15.470
and collaboratively shape the coupling
of the overall industry structure...

00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:16.020
Wei. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:16.620
Yes, sir.

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:17.870
Mind the time.

00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:19.102
You may fast forward this part.

00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:21.100
Yes, Mr. Zhao.

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:22.580
So, what's the charm

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:24.368
of the video game industry?

00:37:24.368 --> 00:37:25.350
The new in-game world...

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:26.139
Ms. Xin, you see,

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:28.220
this is what a meeting
in Sky Fire looks like.

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:30.235
They always use jargon like
granularity and coupling.

00:37:30.235 --> 00:37:32.102
Did you face the same situation
before this too?

00:37:32.124 --> 00:37:33.660
Do you need me to translate it for you?

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:36.790
Mr. Pei, you aren't focused at all.

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:38.990
May I assume that you're just here

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:40.391
to waste the company's money

00:37:40.413 --> 00:37:42.991
instead of learning from and
exchanging cultures with them?

00:37:43.035 --> 00:37:43.750
That's not it.

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:46.950
I came here to learn
from them sincerely.

00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:50.470
Technology and art,
among other elements,

00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:51.857
offer a wide range of options

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:53.790
for people
of different ages and interests...

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:55.970
I wouldn't have sat here
had I known this would happen.

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.220
The chair is so uncomfortable.

00:37:58.350 --> 00:37:59.350
Listen,

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:00.830
once Divine General Pact is in the red,

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:01.990
I'll become wealthy.

00:38:02.013 --> 00:38:03.968
I'll go back and
get a luxurious massage.

00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:07.270
However, in the process
of game development,

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:09.540
video game companies must focus on

00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:12.950
packaging gameplay
and continuously refine it...

00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:13.540
Huang,

00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:15.620
can you actually focus?

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:18.500
Tengda will deal with
many clients in the future.

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:19.910
As a PM (Product Manager),

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:20.950
I must master

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:22.500
these talking points.

00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:24.500
But the more he talks,

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:26.350
the more I like Mr. Pei.

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:29.220
Mr. Pei never wastes our time
with a speech like that.

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:31.660
And find the right target audience...

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:33.500
This is so boring.

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:37.270
As Steve Jobs,

00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:39.100
the founder of Apple, once said,

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:42.950
innovation is the core criterion
that distinguishes leaders

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:44.220
(Ma Yang)
from followers.

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.390
The second charm of the gaming industry

00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:48.870
lies in its inclusivity.

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:51.540
Video games are more than
just a type of entertainment.

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:53.470
It's also a cultural phenomenon.

00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:56.390
It integrates elements from literature,

00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:58.620
technology, art, and more.

00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:01.470
And, it offers a wide range of choices

00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:03.910
for people
of different ages and interests.

00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:07.470
As the saying goes,
you reap what you sow.

00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:10.470
In the future, Sky Fire will also
maintain a long-term perspective,

00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:11.660
stay grounded,

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:13.950
and work hand in hand
with all sectors of the industry

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:17.390
to jointly promote the prosperous
development of the gaming industry.

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:18.020
Excellent!

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:22.350
Excellent!

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:25.020
He's more impatient than me.

00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:27.540
Alright.

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:29.470
Thank you, everyone.

00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:34.990
I was careless.

00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:37.540
The legacy of Fuhui
still runs in my veins.

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:41.470
Next, let's welcome Sky Fire's Mr. Zhao.

00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:42.750

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:45.870

Sorry to say,

00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:01.540
but Sky Fire made
all of these video games.

What game is that?

00:40:12.257 --> 00:40:13.390
I've never heard of it before.

Me too.

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:17.270
