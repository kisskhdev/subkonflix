EPISODE 6

00:01:06.922 --> 00:01:08.048
What is it, then?

00:01:09.341 --> 00:01:11.468
If it's not because
I might cross the line,

00:01:11.552 --> 00:01:13.679
what made you that angry?

00:01:21.395 --> 00:01:22.563
Ten seconds.

00:01:25.691 --> 00:01:26.734
Nine seconds.

00:01:33.324 --> 00:01:34.992
I was afraid I might cross the line.

00:02:04.647 --> 00:02:07.983
So, what you mean is…

00:02:09.443 --> 00:02:12.613
that you want to cross the line with me?

00:02:12.696 --> 00:02:13.822
No.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.910
I mean that I will not cross the line

00:02:18.953 --> 00:02:19.954
with you.

00:02:22.331 --> 00:02:25.626
Goodness, you Seoul people have
such a strange way of talking.

00:02:28.712 --> 00:02:30.756
Why do you not want to cross the line

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:33.384
with me?

00:02:58.033 --> 00:02:58.951
Hello?

00:02:59.618 --> 00:03:01.912
I'm in front of your place.
Come out for a bit.

00:03:05.207 --> 00:03:07.084
Why won't you answer my texts?

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.215
That makes me miss you more.

00:03:13.298 --> 00:03:16.093
How on earth did you know where I live?

00:03:16.885 --> 00:03:18.554
Don't do this ever again.

00:03:19.888 --> 00:03:21.849
Or I will report it.

00:03:22.433 --> 00:03:23.308
Report it?

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:26.270
But… (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:03:28.355 --> 00:03:29.314
you're the one

00:03:30.816 --> 00:03:33.152
who hit on me first, no?

00:03:34.445 --> 00:03:36.238
You said you liked me first.

00:03:36.321 --> 00:03:38.032
I mean,

00:03:38.574 --> 00:03:42.578
you said you liked a caring guy like me!

00:03:43.203 --> 00:03:44.079
Ms. Yoon!

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.089
I made two promises to myself
when I came to Shinsu.

00:03:55.424 --> 00:03:56.592
First,

00:03:57.176 --> 00:04:00.929
"I will not get involved
with a parent again."

00:04:01.805 --> 00:04:02.806
Second,

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.352
"I will never get involved with a parent."

00:04:09.396 --> 00:04:10.272
So,

00:04:11.398 --> 00:04:14.693
nothing can happen between us
because I'm your student's parent?

00:04:15.486 --> 00:04:16.320
Yes.

00:04:17.196 --> 00:04:18.363
What if I'm not a parent?

00:04:19.615 --> 00:04:24.161
If I weren't Han-gyul's uncle,
would you cross the line with me?

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.664
-No.
-Yes.

00:04:28.415 --> 00:04:29.291
"Yes"?

00:04:30.667 --> 00:04:31.960
-No.
-Yes.

00:04:32.836 --> 00:04:34.546
-"Yes"?
-Oh, no.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.633
You see, my brain clearly meant to say no,

00:04:38.217 --> 00:04:41.637
but this darn mouth
keeps saying anything it wants.

00:04:42.471 --> 00:04:45.682
I think my neurotransmission system
is seriously malfunctioning.

00:04:46.433 --> 00:04:47.351
I'll wait, then.

00:04:48.936 --> 00:04:49.770
What?

00:04:50.354 --> 00:04:53.482
But there are still two years left
until Han-gyul graduates.

00:04:54.274 --> 00:04:57.444
Two years will go by fast.

00:04:57.528 --> 00:05:00.072
In days, from today,

00:05:01.073 --> 00:05:02.366
it's 620 days.

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:07.037
In hours, it's 14,880 hours.

00:05:07.121 --> 00:05:09.456
And in minutes… How many?

00:05:11.416 --> 00:05:13.669
It's 892,800 minutes.

00:05:15.087 --> 00:05:16.380
It's long.

00:05:17.131 --> 00:05:18.549
It is long, but--

00:05:18.632 --> 00:05:20.884
It's like waiting for a soldier
to be discharged.

00:05:21.468 --> 00:05:23.804
You think
waiting for two years would be easy?

00:05:23.887 --> 00:05:25.097
Of course not.

00:05:26.056 --> 00:05:28.976
Well, if I did what I usually do,

00:05:29.852 --> 00:05:33.147
we'd have coffee
and go to the movies together.

00:05:36.066 --> 00:05:38.152
We'd celebrate our special days,

00:05:38.235 --> 00:05:40.404
and I'd hold your hand and hug you.

00:05:42.739 --> 00:05:45.742
But if you don't want, I'll never do it.

00:05:47.369 --> 00:05:49.955
I've been waiting for Yoon Bom
for 36 years,

00:05:50.038 --> 00:05:52.583
so what's two more years?

00:05:56.128 --> 00:05:56.962
So...

00:05:58.672 --> 00:05:59.798
trust me.

00:06:01.717 --> 00:06:04.928
But the day Han-gyul graduates,

00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:07.139
let's meet here again.

00:06:07.806 --> 00:06:10.142
That's the day
Sun Jae-gyu and Yoon Bom become

00:06:10.767 --> 00:06:11.727
a couple.

00:06:12.477 --> 00:06:13.353
Okay?

00:06:32.748 --> 00:06:34.333
Who are you fighting with?

00:06:34.416 --> 00:06:35.334
The air?

00:06:36.418 --> 00:06:40.088
Sun Jae-gyu's nowhere to be seen,
and all the others have left.

00:06:40.172 --> 00:06:42.633
Why are you working so hard alone?

00:06:42.716 --> 00:06:45.928
What's a single guy to do at home
except play video games?

00:06:47.471 --> 00:06:50.849
What about you?
Why are you still here at this hour?

00:06:50.933 --> 00:06:53.644
Those drama shows aren't that fun anymore.

00:06:55.062 --> 00:06:57.397
Watching this live here is much better.

00:07:02.527 --> 00:07:04.613
Well, suit yourself.

00:07:13.205 --> 00:07:14.498
Excuse me?

00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.335
Are you a new student?
It's closed for today.

00:07:18.418 --> 00:07:20.003
Oh, hello.

00:07:20.504 --> 00:07:23.757
We just opened an office upstairs,
so I brought some rice cakes.

00:07:24.675 --> 00:07:26.093
It's Choi I-jun Law Office.

00:07:26.927 --> 00:07:30.847
Isn't Choi I-jun
Choi Se-jin's older brother?

00:07:30.931 --> 00:07:32.641
Yes, that's right.

00:07:32.724 --> 00:07:33.767
Goodness.

00:07:35.477 --> 00:07:36.812
Thank you.

00:07:44.152 --> 00:07:46.613
I'm Oh Seong-tae, a paralegal.

00:07:47.614 --> 00:07:48.865
I'm Seo Hye-suk.

00:07:48.949 --> 00:07:50.450
-Have a seat, please.
-Okay.

00:07:50.534 --> 00:07:53.245
Legal counseling
on criminal and civil cases.

00:07:53.328 --> 00:07:55.789
Family lawsuits and divorce cases
are also welcome.

00:07:56.498 --> 00:07:59.668
I think when it comes to divorce,
she's better than you.

00:08:00.252 --> 00:08:01.586
What are you doing?

00:08:02.504 --> 00:08:05.215
Why are you humiliating me
in front of a stranger?

00:08:06.008 --> 00:08:06.842
Why is divorce...

00:08:08.176 --> 00:08:09.011
a humiliation?

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.346
Sorry?

00:08:12.222 --> 00:08:13.849
Actually, I'm divorced too.

00:08:13.932 --> 00:08:15.309
Really?

00:08:15.976 --> 00:08:18.353
I mean, since you're fashionable
and smell good,

00:08:18.437 --> 00:08:20.689
I thought you were a bachelor.
Are you divorced?

00:08:20.772 --> 00:08:24.151
Yes. I thought you were a bachelorette
at first too, Hye-suk.

00:08:25.027 --> 00:08:28.739
Oh, my goodness.
He's calling me Hye-suk. Oh, my.

00:08:29.364 --> 00:08:32.117
By the way, when did you get divorced?

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.618
In 2017.

00:08:35.912 --> 00:08:37.664
March 2017 for me.

00:08:37.748 --> 00:08:38.665
May for me.

00:08:38.749 --> 00:08:40.125
Settlement? Lawsuit?

00:08:40.208 --> 00:08:41.543
-Lawsuit.
-Me too.

00:08:43.128 --> 00:08:45.756
My goodness. We divorced the same way!

00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:47.883
I think we're on the same wavelength.

00:08:47.966 --> 00:08:48.925
Yes!

00:08:49.885 --> 00:08:52.888
Where is this rice cake from?
It's so tough.

00:08:53.722 --> 00:08:56.433
Of course rice cake is tough.
What, should it be crispy?

00:08:57.559 --> 00:08:58.518
Aren't you going home?

00:08:58.602 --> 00:08:59.978
Go ahead if you're busy.

00:09:00.062 --> 00:09:01.146
Let's go.

00:09:01.229 --> 00:09:03.899
I'm going to talk more
with my friend here. You go first.

00:09:06.777 --> 00:09:08.862
Hye-suk, what do you do on weekends?

00:09:08.945 --> 00:09:11.740
On weekends,
I usually catch up on laundry and…

00:09:13.575 --> 00:09:14.618
Nothing special.

00:09:14.701 --> 00:09:17.329
I'm new here,
so I don't know my way around yet.

00:09:17.412 --> 00:09:19.122
Then should I give you a tour?

00:09:19.206 --> 00:09:21.375
Really? Is that okay with you?

00:09:21.458 --> 00:09:22.834
I have a lot of free time.

00:09:24.461 --> 00:09:28.090
Then I'm going to trust you.

00:09:28.673 --> 00:09:30.967
But you can never show it
in front of others,

00:09:31.051 --> 00:09:34.554
especially in front of
students and teachers.

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:38.725
Six hundred and twenty days.

00:09:41.895 --> 00:09:43.438
From today on,

00:09:43.522 --> 00:09:46.274
Yoon Bom is nothing more
than Han-gyul's teacher.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.861
Don't be kind to her. Don't smile at her.

00:09:49.945 --> 00:09:52.489
And never do anything personal
for her. Okay?

00:10:00.539 --> 00:10:02.916
THAT WOMAN

00:10:15.262 --> 00:10:17.055
What are you guys looking at?

00:10:19.099 --> 00:10:21.393
Hurry and take a look.
There. Look at that.

00:10:27.357 --> 00:10:28.233
That…

00:10:29.484 --> 00:10:32.779
That's the woman I told you
I saw with him last time.

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:35.198
She's so beautiful.

00:10:35.282 --> 00:10:37.617
I think she was born
to delight all of mankind.

00:10:37.701 --> 00:10:39.536
Isn't it unbelievable?

00:10:39.619 --> 00:10:43.832
Why is that punk Sun Jae-gyu so lucky
to meet such a pretty woman?

00:10:43.915 --> 00:10:45.792
I just don't understand.

00:10:53.425 --> 00:10:56.219
Did you see that, Ms. Bom?

00:11:00.348 --> 00:11:02.976
I've been waiting for Yoon Bom
for 36 years,

00:11:03.059 --> 00:11:05.020
so what's two more years?

00:11:05.103 --> 00:11:06.480
Trust me.

00:11:08.356 --> 00:11:09.399
That's mine.

00:11:20.035 --> 00:11:22.621
Whoever a parent meets
is none of your business.

00:11:22.704 --> 00:11:25.832
As educators shaping this country's
future, if you have free time,

00:11:26.541 --> 00:11:29.836
I recommend that you use it
on your teaching aids and student records.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.087
Well, then.

00:11:32.255 --> 00:11:33.507
What's she saying?

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:34.716
What's with her?

00:11:37.552 --> 00:11:40.388
What, he said he'd wait two years,
and he's two-timing me?

00:11:40.472 --> 00:11:44.726
Or as Ms. Seo said, does he just fall for
every pretty woman he sees?

00:11:46.978 --> 00:11:48.438
She's so beautiful.

00:11:48.522 --> 00:11:50.774
I think she was born
to delight all mankind.

00:11:59.658 --> 00:12:00.492
Well,

00:12:01.409 --> 00:12:05.288
I look like I was born to represent
the bleak future of mankind.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:11.545
I'll show you what happens in Shinsu

00:12:11.628 --> 00:12:14.214
when I decide to make myself attractive.

00:12:14.297 --> 00:12:16.967
I'm Yoon Bom. Brace yourself, mankind.

00:12:18.176 --> 00:12:19.636
Should I wear my hair up?

00:12:22.305 --> 00:12:24.099
I'm mankind's goddess from now on.

00:12:52.836 --> 00:12:54.087
What happened with her?

00:12:56.214 --> 00:12:57.132
It's over.

00:12:59.092 --> 00:12:59.968
What's over?

00:13:02.596 --> 00:13:03.471
Sun Han-gyul.

00:13:05.515 --> 00:13:06.474
Do you...

00:13:08.393 --> 00:13:09.728
like me?

00:13:14.274 --> 00:13:16.568
I saw the sports festival video earlier,

00:13:17.986 --> 00:13:20.113
and you were smiling when I won.

00:13:21.656 --> 00:13:24.075
But I just don't get it.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.202
How could you smile?

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:30.248
A thriller suits us better than a romance.

00:13:31.875 --> 00:13:32.834
A thriller?

00:13:33.501 --> 00:13:36.838
Have you ever heard of Salieri
and Mozart congratulating each other?

00:13:37.672 --> 00:13:41.551
Shouldn't we snarl at each other forever
and only smile at the other's funeral?

00:13:43.428 --> 00:13:46.723
You mean you can only smile when I die?

00:13:47.265 --> 00:13:48.725
-Is that it?
-Right.

00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:50.393
Actually, no.

00:13:51.811 --> 00:13:53.772
I can't smile if you die.

00:13:54.356 --> 00:13:57.233
Without you, I wouldn't get Grade 1
because of the grade ratio.

00:14:05.408 --> 00:14:07.661
Sure, it's a thriller.

00:14:08.536 --> 00:14:09.371
It is?

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:13.375
Didn't you see at the sports fest?

00:14:14.042 --> 00:14:16.252
All the girls at our school
are crazy about me.

00:14:16.753 --> 00:14:18.588
Why would I like a girl like you?

00:14:19.714 --> 00:14:23.051
You gave it your all
when it wouldn't even affect our grades.

00:14:23.134 --> 00:14:24.469
I was laughing at you.

00:14:27.013 --> 00:14:29.307
Goodness, why did you do that?

00:14:29.391 --> 00:14:32.143
When she suddenly went on
about a thriller,

00:14:32.227 --> 00:14:35.522
I got upset and said things I didn't mean.

00:14:37.232 --> 00:14:39.067
I couldn't tell her how I feel anyway,

00:14:39.567 --> 00:14:41.194
so I'll just bury it and move on.

00:14:41.277 --> 00:14:43.905
Men should be straightforward.
Just tell her.

00:14:51.579 --> 00:14:53.748
Now that you have feelings for her,

00:14:54.582 --> 00:14:55.834
it's too late

00:14:57.043 --> 00:14:59.170
to escape that fate.

00:15:01.339 --> 00:15:03.341
If you're done, go to school. It's late.

00:15:03.425 --> 00:15:05.552
Did things work out with Ms. Bom?

00:15:08.638 --> 00:15:10.849
Your uncle manned up and--

00:15:10.932 --> 00:15:12.934
-Are you seeing her?
-Two years.

00:15:15.311 --> 00:15:16.271
I'm waiting for her.

00:15:16.354 --> 00:15:17.397
For two years?

00:15:18.314 --> 00:15:21.276
Two years is long enough
for the Earth's temperature to rise 2°C

00:15:21.359 --> 00:15:23.570
and for newly joined soldiers
to be discharged.

00:15:23.653 --> 00:15:24.946
How will you wait that long?

00:15:25.029 --> 00:15:28.158
If the one I like says so,
I do it no matter what.

00:15:28.241 --> 00:15:29.325
You know?

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:32.537
Come on, Uncle. Just go already.

00:15:33.163 --> 00:15:35.248
It's heavy.
Let me go up to the front gate.

00:15:37.542 --> 00:15:39.419
Wow, she's shining.

00:15:40.086 --> 00:15:41.713
She looks like a celebrity.

00:15:41.796 --> 00:15:42.839
She's so pretty.

00:15:47.051 --> 00:15:47.886
What's going on?

00:15:51.973 --> 00:15:53.016
What's happening?

00:15:54.309 --> 00:15:55.852
It feels like spring.

00:15:57.187 --> 00:15:59.105
I love you!

00:15:59.189 --> 00:16:00.315
She's a goddess!

00:16:03.234 --> 00:16:05.069
Hey. Hi, Han-gyul.

00:16:18.708 --> 00:16:19.751
She's pretty.

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:38.478
She's so pretty.

00:16:39.771 --> 00:16:42.482
Mr. Sun, I have a question for you.

00:16:54.702 --> 00:16:57.705
What? Is he avoiding me?

00:16:58.873 --> 00:17:00.959
Where is he going in such a hurry?

00:17:14.639 --> 00:17:16.140
-Hey.
-Yes?

00:17:16.683 --> 00:17:19.435
Why is he plowing the field like crazy?

00:17:19.519 --> 00:17:21.271
Remember what I said?

00:17:21.354 --> 00:17:24.023
It seems like he needs something
to distract himself

00:17:24.107 --> 00:17:26.276
from all the evil thoughts in his head.

00:17:26.901 --> 00:17:30.488
I don't know
if his head is full of evil thoughts,

00:17:30.572 --> 00:17:33.074
but I do know
what my artificial joints are saying.

00:17:33.157 --> 00:17:34.117
What's that?

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:39.330
They want his head to be
full of evil thoughts every day.

00:17:42.083 --> 00:17:42.959
Goodness.

00:17:43.543 --> 00:17:44.586
I love him.

00:17:46.671 --> 00:17:48.214
I'm Sun Jae-gyu.

00:17:48.798 --> 00:17:50.425
I will wait.

00:17:51.384 --> 00:17:54.554
I'm the uncle Han-gyul is proud of!

00:18:09.611 --> 00:18:11.279
Why is it acting up again?

00:18:13.364 --> 00:18:16.743
I'm sorry, Bom-sik.
I'll hurry and come in soon. Sorry.

00:18:17.952 --> 00:18:19.120
Darn it.

00:18:20.246 --> 00:18:21.080
Gosh.

00:18:34.677 --> 00:18:35.553
Hey.

00:18:46.606 --> 00:18:48.608
Are you coming from the skewer place?

00:18:50.944 --> 00:18:55.365
You left in such a hurry earlier,
so I couldn't ask.

00:18:58.868 --> 00:19:01.329
Let's talk after we open the door.

00:19:01.412 --> 00:19:02.789
The key is acting up again.

00:19:03.373 --> 00:19:06.459
Could you go over the wall
and open it for me like last time?

00:19:10.922 --> 00:19:11.839
Mr. Sun?

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:35.238
What on earth?

00:19:35.321 --> 00:19:37.699
Wait, Mr. Sun! Hey!

00:19:37.782 --> 00:19:40.118
You cowardly jerk!

00:19:40.201 --> 00:19:41.285
Darn it.

00:19:46.249 --> 00:19:47.250
Han-gyul.

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:49.002
Are you back, Uncle?

00:19:50.169 --> 00:19:51.129
Here.

00:19:56.259 --> 00:19:57.093
What?

00:19:57.176 --> 00:19:59.846
You must've run like crazy.
It's still steaming.

00:19:59.929 --> 00:20:02.181
Do you want to drop out of school
and get your GED?

00:20:02.265 --> 00:20:03.975
Why would I do that?

00:20:04.058 --> 00:20:04.976
You don't want to?

00:20:05.059 --> 00:20:06.644
-I don't.
-Got it.

00:20:07.228 --> 00:20:09.981
Time machines won't be invented
anytime soon, right?

00:20:10.565 --> 00:20:11.691
No.

00:20:11.774 --> 00:20:13.860
-According to the theory of relativity--
-Don't.

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.988
What are the scientists doing?
They should work harder.

00:20:28.124 --> 00:20:29.167
Bom-sik.

00:20:30.418 --> 00:20:33.546
He's definitely doing that on purpose.

00:20:34.047 --> 00:20:36.424
He doesn't even look me in the eye
or answer me.

00:20:38.051 --> 00:20:40.928
You'd open the door for a dog
if it's locked out.

00:20:51.731 --> 00:20:54.233
"Tread softly on me as you go."

00:21:07.246 --> 00:21:08.581
Thank you.

00:21:08.664 --> 00:21:11.084
I did hear from Ms. Seo
that you opened an office,

00:21:11.167 --> 00:21:12.794
but I didn't know you take this path.

00:21:16.631 --> 00:21:19.342
In Seoul, I used to run
in Hangang River Park every day,

00:21:19.425 --> 00:21:21.803
but I don't know
anywhere good to run here.

00:21:23.513 --> 00:21:27.725
So I'm trying to find
a good running route in Shinsu.

00:21:29.519 --> 00:21:33.397
Actually, I have something
to talk about with you.

00:21:33.481 --> 00:21:36.818
Do you have time this weekend?

00:21:39.737 --> 00:21:42.782
Thoughts come to you
when you let your guard down,

00:21:43.449 --> 00:21:47.203
and make you feel low from time to time.

00:21:48.579 --> 00:21:50.706
Don't be a slave to your thoughts.

00:21:51.666 --> 00:21:57.046
And don't regard
those thoughts as your true self.

00:21:57.964 --> 00:22:00.049
Thoughts are just thoughts.

00:22:01.134 --> 00:22:06.848
In order to breathe smoothly,
sit straight.

00:22:22.947 --> 00:22:24.157
CERTIFIED LETTER

00:22:27.577 --> 00:22:28.703
"Certified Letter."

00:22:28.786 --> 00:22:30.705
Wow, it looks good.

00:22:30.788 --> 00:22:33.166
"In 2025,
during the Shinsu High sports festival,

00:22:33.249 --> 00:22:36.335
-you made the promises listed below."
-Yes.

00:22:36.419 --> 00:22:37.253
"One."

00:22:37.336 --> 00:22:40.756
If I participate,
I'll join the military again.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.258
"Join the military again."

00:22:43.009 --> 00:22:45.511
"Two. At barbecue places…"

00:22:45.595 --> 00:22:46.429
Only vegetables.

00:22:46.512 --> 00:22:48.389
"...you'll only eat vegetables."

00:22:48.472 --> 00:22:50.558
"Three. For the rest of your life…"

00:22:50.641 --> 00:22:51.851
I'll call you "honey."

00:22:53.811 --> 00:22:55.479
"...you'll call the sender 'honey.'"

00:22:55.563 --> 00:22:56.939
Hey, honey.

00:23:07.408 --> 00:23:10.203
I actually called
the Ministry of Defense about it,

00:23:10.286 --> 00:23:12.747
but they say I can't serve
in the military twice.

00:23:13.915 --> 00:23:14.749
But...

00:23:15.708 --> 00:23:18.294
as for the other promises written here,

00:23:19.545 --> 00:23:21.839
I promise to fulfill them faithfully.

00:23:23.716 --> 00:23:25.635
Honey.

00:23:31.265 --> 00:23:36.395
On second thought,
I think I can let the last clause go.

00:23:36.479 --> 00:23:38.648
No, no. A promise is a promise.

00:23:38.731 --> 00:23:41.108
If you're done, can I go now, honey?

00:23:41.192 --> 00:23:42.026
I'll get going.

00:23:50.826 --> 00:23:52.286
Was the rumor true?

00:23:56.832 --> 00:23:57.750
At that house,

00:23:58.918 --> 00:24:00.127
did you do that…

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.090
to your father?

00:24:04.173 --> 00:24:05.883
This is why we can't be friends.

00:24:06.968 --> 00:24:10.471
You see, friends aren't
supposed to believe rumors.

00:24:11.097 --> 00:24:12.807
They're supposed to trust each other.

00:24:17.812 --> 00:24:19.063
Come if you need my help.

00:24:20.856 --> 00:24:24.110
I… opened an office in Shinsu.

00:24:28.948 --> 00:24:29.865
Well,

00:24:30.616 --> 00:24:33.619
you have the right to choose
where you live in Korea,

00:24:33.703 --> 00:24:35.413
so you can live wherever you want.

00:24:35.997 --> 00:24:38.874
But even if I commit a crime
and end up in jail,

00:24:38.958 --> 00:24:41.127
I will never go to you for help.

00:24:41.919 --> 00:24:45.423
So you can throw this out for me.
Okay, honey?

00:24:50.261 --> 00:24:51.387
Yes, Ms. Bom.

00:24:53.222 --> 00:24:54.140
Coffee?

00:24:56.017 --> 00:24:57.101
I'd love that.

00:24:57.184 --> 00:24:59.770
Then I'll see you there soon.

00:25:05.276 --> 00:25:07.028
Why would Ms. Bom call you?

00:25:09.905 --> 00:25:11.073
"Honey."

00:25:11.157 --> 00:25:14.160
Why would Ms. Bom call you, honey?

00:25:14.243 --> 00:25:18.706
Gosh, at this rate, I'll end up
plowing all of Dong-pyo's grandma's field.

00:25:18.789 --> 00:25:20.666
I should buy a field for myself.

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:24.170
She doesn't know how I feel.
She keeps confusing me.

00:25:25.087 --> 00:25:26.547
What's with her?

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:27.923
Darn it!

00:25:30.593 --> 00:25:32.970
There are no CCTV cameras around here.

00:25:33.054 --> 00:25:35.222
Then where were you last night, ma'am?

00:25:35.306 --> 00:25:36.891
-What is it?
-Dong-pyo, what is it?

00:25:36.974 --> 00:25:39.185
Ms. Seo, our house was robbed last night.

00:25:39.268 --> 00:25:40.811
-Oh, my.
-Robbed?

00:25:41.604 --> 00:25:46.525
This damn thief
took my medal from the sports festival,

00:25:46.609 --> 00:25:48.527
the meju I hung in the yard,

00:25:48.611 --> 00:25:51.364
and the dried bracken. They took them all.

00:25:51.447 --> 00:25:52.823
My goodness.

00:25:52.907 --> 00:25:54.825
The thief must be a gourmet.

00:25:54.909 --> 00:25:57.620
How did they know
how good your doenjang is

00:25:57.703 --> 00:25:59.372
and take all of it?

00:25:59.455 --> 00:26:01.624
There are no CCTVs
around your place too, right?

00:26:01.707 --> 00:26:03.376
Make sure to lock your doors.

00:26:04.001 --> 00:26:06.379
Oh, my. I should warn her.

00:26:23.687 --> 00:26:25.773
"Meet a successful professional."

00:26:25.856 --> 00:26:27.274
You're treating me to coffee

00:26:27.775 --> 00:26:29.985
and even a nice meal at a good restaurant

00:26:30.736 --> 00:26:31.904
because of this.

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:34.698
My school is in such a remote area,

00:26:34.782 --> 00:26:37.660
so the students can't meet
people from various professions.

00:26:37.743 --> 00:26:38.702
MS. SEO HYE-SUK

00:26:45.459 --> 00:26:48.796
So we hold a public lecture
for the students every year.

00:26:49.422 --> 00:26:51.632
I didn't know my first job in Shinsu

00:26:51.715 --> 00:26:54.301
would be a lecture instead of a lawsuit.

00:26:55.219 --> 00:26:58.806
I was actually wondering,
why did you open your business here?

00:27:02.601 --> 00:27:04.019
November 2020,

00:27:05.896 --> 00:27:08.732
a teacher's teeth were damaged
after an attack by a parent.

00:27:09.316 --> 00:27:13.028
Because they felt the teacher
failed to stop students from fighting.

00:27:14.822 --> 00:27:16.282
And in 2023,

00:27:16.866 --> 00:27:20.578
because a teacher gave zero points
to students who cheated on an exam,

00:27:21.162 --> 00:27:22.705
one of the students' parents

00:27:23.205 --> 00:27:25.291
assaulted the teacher
in front of students.

00:27:26.208 --> 00:27:28.752
Why are you telling me this
all of a sudden?

00:27:31.505 --> 00:27:32.381
I'm bragging.

00:27:32.965 --> 00:27:36.385
Those lawsuits, I won them all.

00:27:40.681 --> 00:27:43.267
People get wronged everywhere,

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:45.686
and I'm the only lawyer in Shinsu.

00:27:45.769 --> 00:27:48.481
Wow, I've got a monopoly here.

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:53.194
You see, words like "the only one,"
"unrivaled," and "unprecedented"

00:27:53.819 --> 00:27:56.489
get me more excited than money.

00:27:58.032 --> 00:28:00.159
So if something unfair happens to you,

00:28:00.743 --> 00:28:02.203
make sure to hire me.

00:28:02.912 --> 00:28:06.790
If it's about you,
I'll take the case, no questions asked.

00:28:12.963 --> 00:28:14.006
It looks good.

00:28:23.432 --> 00:28:27.019
You told me
about the teachers' lawsuits earlier.

00:28:27.895 --> 00:28:28.729
Yes.

00:28:30.231 --> 00:28:34.902
This is about what happened
to my colleague's colleague's colleague.

00:28:36.195 --> 00:28:37.363
Go ahead.

00:28:41.033 --> 00:28:42.284
During class,

00:28:43.536 --> 00:28:47.039
one of the students' parents
barged into the classroom.

00:28:48.874 --> 00:28:49.792
And…

00:28:51.252 --> 00:28:53.879
they slapped the teacher's face…

00:29:04.932 --> 00:29:07.059
What? That's my place.

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:11.438
-Hurry!
-Hurry!

00:29:12.106 --> 00:29:15.150
-He's in there.
-Hurry!

00:29:16.569 --> 00:29:18.571
Ms. Yoon, where have you been?

00:29:18.654 --> 00:29:19.613
What happened?

00:29:19.697 --> 00:29:23.742
We were passing by, and some guy was
trying to break into your house.

00:29:23.826 --> 00:29:24.994
So we called the police.

00:29:25.578 --> 00:29:26.453
What?

00:29:38.382 --> 00:29:41.427
Yes, you have the right
to remain silent and…

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:42.553
Stay still!

00:29:42.636 --> 00:29:45.514
Anything you say
can and will be used against you…

00:29:45.598 --> 00:29:48.475
Why is this punk so strong? Stay still!

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:50.394
I live here.

00:29:51.395 --> 00:29:53.188
Did you catch the thief?

00:29:59.945 --> 00:30:02.615
His uncle is... a thief?

00:30:03.616 --> 00:30:04.533
Ms. Bom!

00:30:07.369 --> 00:30:10.414
Even I would think I'm a thief, but…

00:30:10.956 --> 00:30:12.082
Do you know him?

00:30:12.166 --> 00:30:14.918
I know him,
but I can't say he's not a thief.

00:30:15.502 --> 00:30:17.004
Wait, why would you…

00:30:17.087 --> 00:30:18.464
Why did you cuff me?

00:30:19.006 --> 00:30:22.301
Ms. Bom, today is the day I visit Bom-sik.

00:30:22.384 --> 00:30:23.719
I came to pick him up and…

00:30:25.929 --> 00:30:28.057
He's the one! The thief is here!

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:29.767
Where are you going? Stop there.

00:30:31.143 --> 00:30:32.895
You little punks, get out of the way.

00:30:32.978 --> 00:30:34.813
-You go.
-You punks, I'll…

00:30:34.897 --> 00:30:37.358
Uncle, he's the thief.

00:30:40.277 --> 00:30:42.279
You're dead today.

00:30:42.988 --> 00:30:43.822
Come here.

00:30:47.785 --> 00:30:48.786
Come here.

00:31:10.099 --> 00:31:11.975
No, no! Get in!

00:31:13.811 --> 00:31:14.812
What? We're busy.

00:31:14.895 --> 00:31:18.732
In this day and age,
we shouldn't use our legs.

00:31:20.484 --> 00:31:22.111
We should use our brains.

00:31:23.112 --> 00:31:24.905
It's this guy! Catch him!

00:31:24.988 --> 00:31:26.323
This guy in the red shirt.

00:31:26.407 --> 00:31:27.658
What?

00:31:33.414 --> 00:31:38.001
I have important materials in my phone,
so I'm using a GPS tracking app.

00:31:38.085 --> 00:31:39.628
Look here.

00:31:40.337 --> 00:31:43.674
The location of my phone
is the thief's location.

00:32:32.848 --> 00:32:35.350
That crazy jerk.
Why does he keep following me?

00:32:37.561 --> 00:32:38.854
Stop!

00:32:50.741 --> 00:32:53.535
Warm sunlight and a gentle breeze.

00:32:54.244 --> 00:32:57.748
Doesn't Shinsu feel so peaceful
for the first time in a while?

00:32:57.831 --> 00:33:01.335
Yes, but I don't think
that's really the case.

00:33:01.418 --> 00:33:03.045
-What?
-Look.

00:33:05.422 --> 00:33:06.840
Get out of the way!

00:33:14.223 --> 00:33:16.141
Get out of the way!

00:33:16.225 --> 00:33:17.684
Get out of the way! Move…

00:33:24.483 --> 00:33:25.317
You…

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.195
I'm not a bad guy. I'm…

00:33:29.321 --> 00:33:32.407
Isn't that Han-gyul's uncle?

00:33:32.491 --> 00:33:33.492
Yes.

00:33:33.575 --> 00:33:36.870
What kind of trouble did he cause
that got him handcuffed?

00:33:41.416 --> 00:33:42.376
Put it down.

00:33:43.085 --> 00:33:44.127
Who are you?

00:33:45.212 --> 00:33:46.213
Don't move!

00:34:48.859 --> 00:34:50.861
It doesn't make sense.

00:34:50.944 --> 00:34:52.738
Why am I an assailant? Why?

00:34:54.364 --> 00:34:55.282
Officer.

00:34:55.365 --> 00:34:57.826
You can never let him go, okay?

00:34:57.910 --> 00:35:00.287
Well, don't worry.
Your registration number?

00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:02.831
Hey. What happened?

00:35:03.498 --> 00:35:06.043
This woman told me to do it.

00:35:07.252 --> 00:35:08.128
What?

00:35:12.424 --> 00:35:13.842
3 HOURS AGO

00:35:15.135 --> 00:35:19.222
Gosh, I don't have time to wait.
I'm fully booked today.

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:22.392
Gosh, why won't she pick up?

00:35:22.476 --> 00:35:25.604
With the door lock in this state,
she might get robbed at night.

00:35:25.687 --> 00:35:27.731
What should I do? Change it or not?

00:35:29.566 --> 00:35:32.235
It's better to come back
when she's home, right?

00:35:32.319 --> 00:35:34.738
Then I'll have to charge you
another trip fee.

00:35:37.824 --> 00:35:39.451
Fine, just do it.

00:35:39.534 --> 00:35:43.163
I'll just replace it and give her
the passcode. That'll be fine.

00:35:43.246 --> 00:35:44.164
Right?

00:35:44.247 --> 00:35:46.249
Yes, I should do it
since I'm already here.

00:35:46.333 --> 00:35:47.584
That saves me another trip.

00:35:48.168 --> 00:35:51.254
I have a lot of reservations,
so it's hard to book me.

00:35:51.338 --> 00:35:54.716
I was just changing the door lock
like the owner told me to.

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.595
Save, my foot.

00:36:02.933 --> 00:36:04.559
What's the number for the police?

00:36:05.227 --> 00:36:07.771
Hello? Is this the police?

00:36:08.355 --> 00:36:10.440
This is Kim Min-guk,
a future brave citizen.

00:36:12.401 --> 00:36:14.945
This won't do. I should go get a crowbar.

00:36:18.949 --> 00:36:20.200
Bom-sik.

00:36:20.742 --> 00:36:21.785
Bom…

00:36:23.745 --> 00:36:24.621
What?

00:36:25.414 --> 00:36:26.415
Why is it open?

00:36:27.874 --> 00:36:28.917
You see,

00:36:29.001 --> 00:36:33.005
the door was open, so I was worried
there was a thief, so I went in.

00:36:35.257 --> 00:36:39.594
But I thought there could be
a misunderstanding from the start.

00:36:40.637 --> 00:36:42.055
Because the door lock

00:36:42.681 --> 00:36:45.684
was so beautifully removed.

00:36:45.767 --> 00:36:49.354
Gosh. Then you should've said
you were a locksmith right away.

00:36:49.438 --> 00:36:52.024
Why did you run away?
Everyone got you wrong.

00:36:52.858 --> 00:36:55.068
Look at the look in his eyes.

00:36:58.030 --> 00:37:01.199
He was running toward me,
saying, "You're dead today!"

00:37:01.783 --> 00:37:03.952
My knees started to tremble, you know?

00:37:04.036 --> 00:37:05.454
I was petrified.

00:37:07.622 --> 00:37:10.208
-I couldn't say anything, okay?
-This is crazy.

00:37:11.418 --> 00:37:13.795
Lock this punk up if necessary.

00:37:13.879 --> 00:37:16.631
And his twin brother, lock him up too.

00:37:16.715 --> 00:37:17.549
Why me?

00:37:17.632 --> 00:37:18.633
Calm down.

00:37:18.717 --> 00:37:21.470
There was a bit of a misunderstanding,

00:37:21.553 --> 00:37:24.139
but no one's hurt, so let's settle this…

00:37:24.222 --> 00:37:26.475
Officer, wait. I feel weird.

00:37:26.558 --> 00:37:28.351
I'm not feeling well.

00:37:28.435 --> 00:37:32.022
I think when I fell down, I hurt my hips.

00:37:32.522 --> 00:37:34.316
All of a sudden? Why are you…

00:37:34.399 --> 00:37:35.233
Do you want to die?

00:37:36.985 --> 00:37:38.487
Hey, be quiet!

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:39.738
Let go, you brats!

00:37:39.821 --> 00:37:43.033
Goodness, I don't think
I can squat in this state.

00:37:44.034 --> 00:37:47.037
If I can't squat, I can't do my job.

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:49.331
What do I do? My wife and kids…

00:37:50.123 --> 00:37:53.919
How will I provide for my wife and kids?
Oh, no.

00:37:55.712 --> 00:37:56.630
Ms. Bom.

00:37:58.048 --> 00:38:01.009
I'm okay. What about you? Are you hurt?

00:38:03.261 --> 00:38:04.763
Why are you so reckless?

00:38:08.141 --> 00:38:09.184
Reckless?

00:38:09.267 --> 00:38:13.146
The police officers were there. Why did
you have to butt in and make this mess?

00:38:13.647 --> 00:38:16.483
Don't you know when to jump in
and when to step back?

00:38:19.778 --> 00:38:21.488
Ms. Bom. You know what?

00:38:22.906 --> 00:38:25.867
If it's about you, I'm always jumping in.
I'll never step back.

00:38:26.451 --> 00:38:28.370
If the same situation happened again,

00:38:28.995 --> 00:38:31.832
and there were even a 1% chance
that guy was the thief,

00:38:31.915 --> 00:38:34.000
I'd go after him. That is…

00:38:35.627 --> 00:38:36.795
the Sun Jae-gyu way.

00:38:37.379 --> 00:38:39.047
And that's being reckless.

00:38:39.881 --> 00:38:41.466
Look at Mr. Choi.

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:44.344
Didn't you see
how he found where the guy was?

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:47.889
Can you please stop using your muscles

00:38:48.765 --> 00:38:50.392
and start using your brain?

00:38:51.518 --> 00:38:52.978
Hold on.

00:38:53.562 --> 00:38:57.232
Why do you keep
comparing me to Choi I-jun?

00:38:58.358 --> 00:39:00.193
Because you two are so different.

00:39:00.277 --> 00:39:02.320
I wasn't going to be petty and say this,

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:09.035
but what did you even do today,
forgetting about Bom-sik?

00:39:09.619 --> 00:39:11.955
Do you think I didn't know you went

00:39:12.622 --> 00:39:13.790
to have coffee with I-jun?

00:39:18.044 --> 00:39:20.547
You're turning this on me?

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:22.382
This is ridiculous.

00:39:24.384 --> 00:39:25.719
What about you?

00:39:28.847 --> 00:39:29.973
You mean I can't…

00:39:30.765 --> 00:39:31.600
What?

00:39:32.726 --> 00:39:33.643
I can't do the same?

00:39:33.727 --> 00:39:34.895
What do you mean?

00:39:38.899 --> 00:39:39.858
What will you do?

00:39:41.443 --> 00:39:42.402
The current situation.

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:45.780
The victim flatly refused to settle.

00:39:46.865 --> 00:39:50.744
And the only lawyer in Shinsu

00:39:50.827 --> 00:39:52.704
is me, Choi I-jun.

00:39:59.377 --> 00:40:00.503
Why aren't you taking it?

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:11.431
I, Sun Jae-gyu, never go back on my word.

00:40:12.224 --> 00:40:15.977
Five hours ago,
I told him I'd never take help from him...

00:40:18.146 --> 00:40:20.190
even if I ended up in jail.

00:40:29.407 --> 00:40:30.575
Ms. Bom…

00:40:35.413 --> 00:40:37.582
That little… Darn it.

00:40:43.463 --> 00:40:47.759
He's always so reckless. No wonder
there are strange rumors about him.

00:40:48.843 --> 00:40:50.720
What? End up in jail?

00:40:53.723 --> 00:40:55.183
If you go to jail...

00:40:57.644 --> 00:40:59.229
then what about me?

00:41:07.487 --> 00:41:10.407
I tried so hard to keep the promise,

00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:13.451
but she goes and has coffee
with another guy?

00:41:16.788 --> 00:41:17.622
All right.

00:41:18.581 --> 00:41:21.459
This place is comfortable. It's better.

00:41:21.543 --> 00:41:22.836
It's nice and spacious.

00:41:27.257 --> 00:41:28.758
This is nice.

00:41:48.486 --> 00:41:50.322
Bom-sik, let's go to sleep.

00:42:12.886 --> 00:42:13.803
Let's sleep.

00:42:15.055 --> 00:42:16.056
Let's sleep.

00:42:17.015 --> 00:42:18.892
Let's sleep now, okay?

00:42:54.677 --> 00:42:56.304
Sun Jae-gyu, out.

00:43:18.493 --> 00:43:19.577
CHOI I-JUN LAW OFFICE

00:43:20.912 --> 00:43:22.372
"With this settlement, the victim

00:43:22.455 --> 00:43:25.458
agrees not to raise objections,
both civil and criminal."

00:43:25.542 --> 00:43:28.837
"If the assailant doesn't carry out
the agreement,

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:31.840
he is liable to compensate
for all the damages

00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:33.550
caused by it."

00:43:35.468 --> 00:43:36.594
Let's make it clear.

00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:39.514
I didn't hire you to do this.

00:43:39.597 --> 00:43:41.266
You asked me to do it.

00:43:45.728 --> 00:43:47.147
SETTLEMENT

00:43:56.781 --> 00:43:58.992
But why are you helping me
all of a sudden?

00:43:59.075 --> 00:44:01.327
And that guy refused to settle yesterday.

00:44:01.411 --> 00:44:03.413
Why did he suddenly agree to settle?

00:44:05.582 --> 00:44:08.626
In Seoul, my hourly rate was 400,000 won.

00:44:09.335 --> 00:44:11.171
If you're willing to pay me,

00:44:12.672 --> 00:44:14.966
I will kindly explain it to you, sir.

00:44:24.934 --> 00:44:25.935
No.

00:44:26.519 --> 00:44:27.353
What now?

00:44:29.564 --> 00:44:32.317
First things first, right?

00:44:35.778 --> 00:44:37.030
TEMPORARILY CLOSED

00:44:37.113 --> 00:44:38.823
Is he away?

00:44:38.907 --> 00:44:41.409
SHINSU LOCKSMITH

00:44:46.789 --> 00:44:48.583
Gosh, I wanted to talk to him.

00:44:51.586 --> 00:44:52.545
No.

00:44:53.254 --> 00:44:55.715
If I want to apologize,
I shouldn't come empty-handed.

00:45:06.059 --> 00:45:09.145
Hi, auntie. The sikhye looks good.

00:45:10.855 --> 00:45:11.773
Hi.

00:45:21.491 --> 00:45:22.909
Well, I…

00:45:29.999 --> 00:45:32.126
She's not even curious
about how I got out?

00:45:37.465 --> 00:45:39.676
Hold on, miss.

00:45:41.511 --> 00:45:42.428
Give this a try.

00:45:46.224 --> 00:45:48.434
I made it with the pumpkins I grew myself.

00:45:48.518 --> 00:45:50.270
It's really good. Try it.

00:45:53.022 --> 00:45:54.482
-It's good.
-Right?

00:45:54.566 --> 00:45:56.818
I'll take five bottles of this.

00:45:56.901 --> 00:45:57.986
Five bottles?

00:45:58.945 --> 00:46:02.657
Goodness. It'll be so heavy.
How will she carry them?

00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:06.244
You see, ma'am, so many upsetting things
have happened lately.

00:46:06.327 --> 00:46:08.997
So I need to drink this much
to feel better.

00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:12.584
-Give me five bottles.
-Okay. Thank you.

00:46:18.214 --> 00:46:20.008
Why do my shoulders hurt so much?

00:46:20.091 --> 00:46:21.509
Did I sleep funny?

00:46:24.387 --> 00:46:25.305
Geez.

00:46:26.097 --> 00:46:28.349
She might end up hurting her back.

00:46:30.268 --> 00:46:31.394
Goodness.

00:46:31.477 --> 00:46:32.687
Oh, right.

00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:33.813
Ma'am.

00:46:34.606 --> 00:46:37.900
I'm looking for a pot for repotting.

00:46:37.984 --> 00:46:40.111
This wide

00:46:40.194 --> 00:46:43.156
and this tall.
Do you have a pot like that?

00:46:45.366 --> 00:46:46.576
Over there.

00:46:56.628 --> 00:46:57.545
Sun Jae-gyu.

00:46:58.421 --> 00:47:03.217
Why is that darn tree growing so well
when I don't even water it?

00:47:17.106 --> 00:47:18.733
I don't need your help. Just go.

00:47:18.816 --> 00:47:19.651
No.

00:47:21.027 --> 00:47:23.446
Do you think I'm doing this to help you?

00:47:24.072 --> 00:47:26.783
My Jae-gyu pot
isn't being watered properly.

00:47:26.866 --> 00:47:28.743
I want it to be in this big pot.

00:47:29.369 --> 00:47:30.286
Let's go.

00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:31.954
I'll leave after repotting it.

00:48:04.696 --> 00:48:07.031
Gosh, it's too late to ask now.

00:48:07.699 --> 00:48:10.618
If I ask him about the woman
he met last week,

00:48:11.536 --> 00:48:14.414
will I not look nonchalant anymore?

00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:23.548
Why did you lay out your comforter?

00:48:24.924 --> 00:48:26.259
It's nothing.

00:48:26.342 --> 00:48:29.470
Do you have something to tell me?

00:48:30.263 --> 00:48:31.139
Well, no.

00:48:32.557 --> 00:48:35.476
I was just wondering
what you did last weekend.

00:48:38.354 --> 00:48:39.897
I washed Han-gyul's uniform

00:48:39.981 --> 00:48:42.608
and made some jangjorim with beef.

00:48:43.192 --> 00:48:44.861
Oh, is that so?

00:48:47.989 --> 00:48:49.782
He'll never tell me first.

00:48:50.867 --> 00:48:51.701
Anyway, Ms. Bom,

00:48:52.744 --> 00:48:54.454
do you know that you've changed a bit?

00:48:55.788 --> 00:48:57.915
The way you talk is cold as a freezer,

00:48:57.999 --> 00:49:00.752
and you make those weird faces.

00:49:01.335 --> 00:49:03.504
Unlike the Ms. Bom I knew.

00:49:07.425 --> 00:49:08.593
Who are you to talk?

00:49:09.177 --> 00:49:13.806
You see,
I thought you were a man of his word.

00:49:14.474 --> 00:49:16.559
How could you say that?

00:49:16.642 --> 00:49:18.978
Because of you, I got freckles,

00:49:19.061 --> 00:49:21.606
and I say a Buddhist mantra every morning.

00:49:21.689 --> 00:49:22.940
What are you saying?

00:49:23.649 --> 00:49:25.735
Even though I get sunburned,

00:49:25.818 --> 00:49:27.987
I'm trying so hard to be loyal to you.

00:49:31.741 --> 00:49:32.950
"Loyal"?

00:49:34.202 --> 00:49:36.204
Am I someone you try to be loyal to?

00:49:36.287 --> 00:49:37.997
Why would you put it that way?

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:40.458
I'm just saying it's that hard for me.

00:49:40.541 --> 00:49:42.543
If it's that hard, then break it.

00:49:45.838 --> 00:49:46.672
Wait.

00:49:47.590 --> 00:49:50.468
What did you just say?

00:49:51.719 --> 00:49:53.930
You mean, break the promise?

00:49:55.264 --> 00:49:59.018
If you're waiting for me out of loyalty,
then I don't want it.

00:49:59.769 --> 00:50:00.895
You know,

00:50:02.355 --> 00:50:03.231
I…

00:50:05.316 --> 00:50:06.359
What I want is…

00:50:15.993 --> 00:50:16.953
All right.

00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:20.748
I told you.

00:50:21.332 --> 00:50:24.168
I'll never do
what you don't want me to do.

00:50:24.252 --> 00:50:28.464
If what you want is to break the promise,
then I suppose we should.

00:50:29.882 --> 00:50:32.927
Then take care,
and I wish your family peace.

00:50:33.010 --> 00:50:35.763
And I hope all your efforts go well.

00:50:37.431 --> 00:50:38.474
Bom-sik.

00:50:39.851 --> 00:50:42.311
Daddy's leaving now, okay? Take care.

00:50:43.229 --> 00:50:44.063
Don't cry.

00:50:46.858 --> 00:50:47.942
Wait…

00:50:57.201 --> 00:50:58.703
I guess she doesn't like me.

00:50:59.662 --> 00:51:03.249
I was such a fool,
making a fuss over keeping the promise.

00:51:06.836 --> 00:51:07.879
SHINSU LOCKSMITH

00:51:12.049 --> 00:51:13.050
What?

00:51:20.725 --> 00:51:21.976
I wasn't sure,

00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:24.604
but something must be going on
with that woman.

00:51:26.022 --> 00:51:28.399
That's why he left
without even looking back.

00:51:31.694 --> 00:51:33.821
I had no idea and…

00:52:02.642 --> 00:52:03.768
Sir.

00:52:03.851 --> 00:52:07.271
He may look scary,
but he's not a bad person.

00:52:07.355 --> 00:52:09.774
We'll compensate for your injury, so--

00:52:09.857 --> 00:52:13.569
Gosh, stop it. Why are you bothering me
so early in the morning?

00:52:14.362 --> 00:52:16.989
No settlement. I was very clear.

00:52:22.536 --> 00:52:25.206
What's wrong with you, seriously?

00:52:25.289 --> 00:52:27.375
Oh, no. They bent automatically again.

00:52:27.959 --> 00:52:30.670
Sir, I think there's some sensor
embedded in my knees.

00:52:30.753 --> 00:52:33.422
They automatically bend
when I need to apologize.

00:52:33.506 --> 00:52:35.758
And since I'm already kneeling,

00:52:35.841 --> 00:52:37.843
I'll ask you once more.

00:52:38.469 --> 00:52:41.389
If you show mercy just this once…

00:52:41.472 --> 00:52:44.350
You want to add obstruction of business
to the assault charge?

00:52:53.651 --> 00:52:54.986
Is she gone?

00:52:57.697 --> 00:52:58.781
Come on!

00:53:00.408 --> 00:53:03.411
From here to there.

00:53:03.494 --> 00:53:06.038
I'm here as a customer.

00:53:06.122 --> 00:53:08.124
All of the door locks here,

00:53:09.083 --> 00:53:10.835
I'll buy them. Here.

00:53:11.961 --> 00:53:13.713
What, you got 100 doors at your house?

00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:16.465
What are you buying so many for?

00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:18.092
My neighbor's house was robbed.

00:53:18.175 --> 00:53:20.761
So if they change all their door locks,

00:53:20.845 --> 00:53:22.722
it'll be safer. Just do it.

00:53:23.305 --> 00:53:27.476
Geez, you think I'd settle
if you buy so many door locks?

00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:29.854
Goodness. Not a chance.

00:53:30.479 --> 00:53:31.397
Let's see.

00:53:36.569 --> 00:53:38.237
LOVELY SONG GA-IN

00:53:39.613 --> 00:53:41.741
You must be a big fan of Song Ga-in.

00:53:41.824 --> 00:53:45.327
Gosh, who in Korea
doesn't like Song Ga-in?

00:53:45.828 --> 00:53:49.874
I wanted to go to her concert today,
but the tickets sold out so fast.

00:53:56.714 --> 00:53:57.965
Sir, you know what?

00:53:58.841 --> 00:53:59.800
Darn it.

00:54:01.677 --> 00:54:03.471
I know Song Ga-in a little.

00:54:04.597 --> 00:54:06.182
-For real?
-Yes.

00:54:07.183 --> 00:54:10.227
I was very close with someone
who is very close

00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:12.521
with her.

00:54:13.272 --> 00:54:15.691
She's close with someone
you were close with?

00:54:16.567 --> 00:54:18.819
Are you saying
you're close with her or not?

00:54:23.324 --> 00:54:24.200
Don't.

00:54:25.242 --> 00:54:28.162
Before you're a teacher,
you're Jeong Nan-hee's daughter.

00:54:28.245 --> 00:54:30.831
You think people are interested
in your innocence?

00:54:30.915 --> 00:54:33.876
What they're interested in
is not the truth, it's gossip.

00:54:37.088 --> 00:54:39.757
Look at that. I knew it.

00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:41.967
How can you be close with Song Ga-in?

00:54:42.051 --> 00:54:43.469
That's just absurd.

00:54:44.053 --> 00:54:47.848
You're obviously lying.
If that's true, I'm her brother.

00:54:49.225 --> 00:54:52.353
She wouldn't make friends
with just anybody.

00:54:54.021 --> 00:54:57.066
MOM

00:55:06.992 --> 00:55:10.204
DAUGHTER

00:55:12.748 --> 00:55:14.291
I barely fell asleep.

00:55:14.959 --> 00:55:18.629
Who calls so early in the morning?
Darn it.

00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:27.388
Honey.

00:55:28.764 --> 00:55:31.976
What? Who is it?

00:55:37.106 --> 00:55:37.982
Answer it.

00:55:38.649 --> 00:55:39.692
Now.

00:55:47.366 --> 00:55:49.034
Is that you, Bom?

00:55:50.161 --> 00:55:51.495
How have you been…

00:55:54.623 --> 00:55:55.541
Yes.

00:55:56.542 --> 00:55:57.376
Yes.

00:55:58.544 --> 00:56:00.004
What? Who?

00:56:03.257 --> 00:56:05.551
No, I'm not saying I can't…

00:56:07.219 --> 00:56:10.181
Okay. I'll do that.

00:56:10.264 --> 00:56:11.098
You…

00:56:12.725 --> 00:56:13.601
Bom.

00:56:14.268 --> 00:56:15.186
Bom? Yoon Bom?

00:56:17.813 --> 00:56:18.772
She hung up.

00:56:19.982 --> 00:56:22.526
What did she say? What's going on?

00:56:23.861 --> 00:56:26.989
You know Ga-in. Song Ga-in.

00:56:27.072 --> 00:56:29.867
The trot singer at your company?

00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:34.914
She asked for a ticket for her concert.

00:56:35.623 --> 00:56:36.832
What?

00:56:36.916 --> 00:56:38.626
That's how

00:56:38.709 --> 00:56:42.588
I closed my shop
and went to her concert today!

00:56:44.006 --> 00:56:47.176
Check this out.
Have you ever seen anything like this?

00:56:47.968 --> 00:56:52.848
You see, I got this autograph
from Song Ga-in in person.

00:56:53.682 --> 00:56:58.229
"May your business prosper,
Shinsu Locksmith. From Song Ga-in."

00:56:58.979 --> 00:57:00.606
I bet you have nothing like this.

00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:03.025
Of course you don't.

00:57:30.094 --> 00:57:30.970
Mr. Sun?

00:57:34.348 --> 00:57:37.434
You left saying "take care."
Why are you here?

00:57:40.688 --> 00:57:41.855
Why did you do that?

00:57:42.731 --> 00:57:43.691
What do you mean?

00:57:44.650 --> 00:57:47.069
I just heard all about it
from the locksmith.

00:57:49.947 --> 00:57:53.409
I did it because it happened at my place,
so don't read too much into it.

00:57:53.492 --> 00:57:55.452
Even if it happened at their house,

00:57:56.078 --> 00:57:57.746
who would buy that many door locks?

00:57:58.372 --> 00:58:00.040
Who would kneel down for me?

00:58:00.749 --> 00:58:03.002
Who would even get him a concert ticket?

00:58:08.382 --> 00:58:09.967
Why are you being like this?

00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:13.971
You do so much for me without me knowing,

00:58:14.596 --> 00:58:16.765
but why do you act so cold in front of me?

00:58:34.783 --> 00:58:35.617
What…

00:58:44.668 --> 00:58:47.838
Why are you crying suddenly?

00:58:51.675 --> 00:58:53.260
You met up with another woman.

00:58:55.721 --> 00:58:57.723
Last weekend, I saw you

00:58:58.682 --> 00:59:00.017
with another woman.

00:59:02.603 --> 00:59:03.812
She was pretty.

00:59:04.396 --> 00:59:05.689
So pretty.

00:59:07.191 --> 00:59:10.944
I haven't even touched
your fingernail, but…

00:59:12.154 --> 00:59:13.322
But you had...

00:59:14.823 --> 00:59:16.325
coffee with her...

00:59:18.202 --> 00:59:19.411
and held hands with her.

00:59:23.374 --> 00:59:24.375
So…

00:59:26.752 --> 00:59:29.171
you were mad at me because of that?

00:59:29.755 --> 00:59:32.966
You told me to trust you,
and you did that with another woman.

00:59:35.636 --> 00:59:36.845
You're right, Ms. Bom.

00:59:39.556 --> 00:59:40.391
What?

00:59:41.141 --> 00:59:42.351
I, Sun Jae-gyu...

00:59:44.186 --> 00:59:45.813
don't keep my word.

00:59:46.522 --> 00:59:48.357
I'm not as strong as I look,

00:59:49.858 --> 00:59:54.071
and I'm not intelligent, cultured,
refined or patient.

00:59:59.576 --> 01:00:00.661
I'm sorry.

01:00:03.038 --> 01:00:04.248
I can't wait any longer.

01:02:06.036 --> 01:02:09.122
Welcome to our plant, Green Narae!

01:02:09.706 --> 01:02:12.876
Something's going on
between you and Jae-gyu? The twins saw it.

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:17.464
He's the best husband material.
He's strong, influential, and rich.

01:02:17.548 --> 01:02:18.465
Do you like it?

01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:20.133
Why do you keep asking?

01:02:20.217 --> 01:02:23.554
-What if we get caught?
-I'll find the perfect place.

01:02:24.805 --> 01:02:26.723
-No one's here.
-I told you to trust me.

01:02:27.849 --> 01:02:29.726
-Mr. Sun.
-Yes, Ms. Bom.

01:02:29.810 --> 01:02:31.770
Can I say what I couldn't earlier?

01:02:35.816 --> 01:02:37.818
