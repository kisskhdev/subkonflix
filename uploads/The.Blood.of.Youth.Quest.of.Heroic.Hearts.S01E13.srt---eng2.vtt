00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.016
The lack of a sword
can triumph over a sword,

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.720
for a sword is not the be-all and end-all.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.080
The lack of a sword
can triumph over a sword,

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.320
for a sword is not the be-all and end-all.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.480
Once you understand it,

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.960
you will be able

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.400
to unsheathe your sword.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.200
The lack of a sword
can triumph over a sword,

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.960
for a sword is not the be-all and end-all?

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.040
Xiaohua.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.720
You possess medicinal knowledge,

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.360
and have the heart of a healer.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.960
I will give you the Wanling Pill.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.200
Once ingested,

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.640
it can cure all ailments.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.880
Remember.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.120
Only use it

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.880
as a last resort.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.320
And only

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.440
use it

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.280
on yourself.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.240
Thank you, Sir.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.360
I will remember that.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.600
Young heroes.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.880
Walk your chosen path now.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.200
Where should we go now?

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.520
We have to use the Skysplitter

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.640
to find Xiao Se.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.360
I wonder

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.080
how it can guide us to him.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.320
I heard that when the Skysplitter
found its owner back then,

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.080
it flew to Xiao Se.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.160
Perhaps

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.400
we can unsheathe it?

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.680
Ancient swords have their idiosyncrasies.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.400
They only recognize their owners.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.280
You won't

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.800
unsheathe it easily.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.440
They say

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.776
when the Skysplitter appears,

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.840
the world will be upended.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.416
Even if you have the Skysplitter,

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.320
it doesn't mean it
recognizes you as its owner.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.760
What do we do now then?

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.560
Xiaohua. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.400
Do you have any information about Xiao Se?

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.600
I have an idea.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.240
What is it?

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.880
Whatever you're looking for

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.800
is always right before you.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.600
How could I almost forget this?

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.880
My master, Lei Wujie,

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.080
was once a good friend of Xiao Se.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.760
Follow me back

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.280
to Lei's Stronghold to ask my master.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.880
That might work.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.480
Let's go.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.840
My searching effort has paid off.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.280
I finally located the three of them.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.000
I shall join them first

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.760
before stealing the sword when possible.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.760
I will

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.000
have the Skysplitter.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.440
Ye!

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:21.480
Ye,

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:22.920
what are you doing here?

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.720
Did you

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.160
just leave the corridor as well?

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
How did it go?

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.160
It's just inner demon.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.400
Surely, it wasn't that hard.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:34.880
I'm fine. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.480
But what about you?

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.680
What brought you here?

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.520
Oh, I almost forgot.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.640
Check this out.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.120
This

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.000
is the real Skysplitter.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.120
The fragments

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.200
are all a lie.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.640
They truly got it.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.680
With this sword,

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.200
we can help Weigui

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.680
find his memory.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.160
Unfortunately,

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.160
we couldn't

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.560
ask my master

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.720
about Xiao Se's whereabouts.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.560
He went out traveling.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.640
He said he'd be away for a year.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.000
I'm a living intelligence post.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.120
Fear not.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.720
Are you all looking for Xiao Se, perhaps?

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.800
The strong

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.400
but elusive Xiao Se?

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.560
You know him?

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.680
Of course, I do.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.640
And not just me.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.880
The entire village knows him.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.080
Last year,

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.880
a group of bandits raided our village.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.736
They killed and burned,

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.440
committing every atrocity.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.800
Xiao Se saved us,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.296
and restored peace to the village.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.760
Do you know where he lives now?

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:41.760
Of course,

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:42.880
I do.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.320
I can bring you there.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.680
But...

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:49.440
But what?

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.120
But I'm just a farmer.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.760
Xiao Se lives faraway,

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.680
and I still have work to finish.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.640

we. (Support Admin Watch on

There is not even the sound of water.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.160
It's too quiet.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
What a rare sight.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.080
How much longer till we leave the forest?

How much longer till we leave the forest?

It's winter now.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.840
Why are there peach blossoms?

It's a trap.

Hua Xiaohua.

Lei Lingze!

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.080
Why give it to me?

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:07.760
Because we are friends.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.160
Take it.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.280
Lei Lingze.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.240
This is the best opportunity to
run away with the Skysplitter.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.720
But they...

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:37.680
Look, Weigui.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.880
It seems to react to sound.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.080
Throw another thunderbolt bomb.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.200
Quick.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:49.760
It worked.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.040
It lured it away.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.240
Let's go.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.440
Let's go.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.680
Run.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.840
Are you all right?

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.320
I'm sure the farmer

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.480
brought us here

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:07.880
to kill us.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.360
Are you one of Tianwaitian?

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.160
I knew it.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:38.800
This is...

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:39.920
What's going on?

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.480
No idea.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.680
But he

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.440
probably won't return for now.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.040
Let's find a spot to rest up

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.640
before we plan the next move.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.120
I want to go home.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:16.056
Father, Mother, I'm scared.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.120
A crying noise?

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.200
Is anyone there?

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.320
Help me!

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.440
It seems like

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:29.920
the noise only appears at night.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.840
Wait.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.440
That's the sound of a little girl.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.200
No. We have to go there.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.480
Be patient.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.320
After we enter the peach blossom forest,

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.120
strange things have
happened one after another.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.360
What if this is another trap?

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.360
You're right.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.200
But what if someone is asking for help?

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.360
As young heroes,

00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.776
we can't just sacrifice one life

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.400
just because it might be a trap.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.080
We're in a remote place.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.360
Why would there be sounds of a kid

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.680
and an old woman?

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.296
But we must check it out

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.560
to verify if it's real or fake.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.360
Besides,

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.640
Hua Xiaohua is still missing.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.000
This is a creepy place.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.840
We cannot take another risk.
