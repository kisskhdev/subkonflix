I was told that someone in Qingyin Parlor has the Skysplitter fragment.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.270
You should go there now.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:06.750
May we

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.080
meet again.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.550
Ye

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.120
but he's very strong.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:38.360
And why didn't he get the Skysplitter fragment on his own?

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.270
He

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.030
is stronger than us.

Greetings, Sect Leader.

I wasn't expecting you.

At ease.

Madam,

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:02.600
I have been

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:04.030
collecting herbs for years.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.030
My research

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.200
is about to succeed.

Do not worry, Madam.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.600
I will find a way

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:09.510
to cure you.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.960
What have you done to the villagers?

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.240
I did that for you.

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:17.270
Unfortunately,

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:19.510
you used the wrong method.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:50.120
So,

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:51.240
you must be hungry.

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:52.360
Come.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.510
Thank you for saving my life.

I'm in charge of you.

No need to thank me either.

I was paid for it anyway.

Oh, Weigui,

back then, we were in danger,

so I didn't have time to ask you.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.390
Are you searching for the Skysplitter fragment

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:21.960

No.

You're not power-hungry like the others.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:35.000
Then why do you want

[Left Emissary]
Qiankun Village has been dealt with.

Good.

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:56.320
But

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.720
I would like to seek clarification.

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:01.870
The chief took over the village

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.600
so that he could study medicine for your ailment.

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:05.120
Why must you...

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:09.960
Qin Aoxiong would kill innocents just to set up a trap

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.720
to obtain the Skysplitter fragment.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:15.630
What happened to Qiankun Village was even worse.

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:18.550
The whole village was sacrificed.

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:22.440
Everyone plots and schemes to extreme lengths

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:23.550
to get

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:24.510
the fragment.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.270
Little did they know,

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:29.080
it might just be a lure released by that person.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:31.320
Master told us

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:32.870
that the Skysplitter

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:34.840
was a divine sword forged

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:37.200
by the ancient forge deity using Mountainfort Copper.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:39.480
It is very durable,

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:41.150
and probably will never shatter.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.240
But something doesn't make sense to me.

Who was Qin Aoxiong working for?

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.150
And who

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:48.790
told the chief about the Skysplitter fragment?

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.030
I swear it wasn't me.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:57.600
It's okay.

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:01.390
At this point,

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:03.510
perhaps only he

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.270
My master told me to do that.

I might as well train myself in the martial arts world.

Maybe one day,

the heart of sword like my master did

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.480

Who taught you that?

I bought a random sword manual,

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:58.390
studied it thoroughly,

00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.960
and practiced every day.

to my persistent training.

But

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.720
I've also heard

that an ordinary martial monk
