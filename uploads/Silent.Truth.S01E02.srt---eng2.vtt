WEBVTT

00:00:04.642 --> 00:00:08.646
Your son shoplifted from my store.

00:00:08.713 --> 00:00:09.781
That is,

00:00:09.848 --> 00:00:11.883
if you show me your sincerity.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:12.951
Manager.

00:00:16.221 --> 00:00:18.490
Twenty-three years ago,
within this jurisdiction,

00:00:18.556 --> 00:00:20.959
there was a robbery
of an armored cash transport vehicle

00:00:21.025 --> 00:00:23.828
belonging to the Mitsuba branch
of the Yamato Trust Bank.

00:00:23.895 --> 00:00:26.898
The culprit, Nobukazu Oshima,

00:00:26.965 --> 00:00:28.433
stole 30 million yen in cash

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.436
and fled to a forest five kilometers away.

00:00:31.503 --> 00:00:33.071
He had an encounter with Officer Kiyohara.

00:00:33.905 --> 00:00:35.006
There,

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.377
{\an8}he and Officer Kiyohara shot each other,
and both died.

00:00:40.111 --> 00:00:41.980
It's believed that Oshima's accomplice

00:00:42.046 --> 00:00:45.583
took the 30 million yen
and Officer Kiyohara's gun,

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.085
but the 30 million yen and the gun

00:00:47.852 --> 00:00:50.989
were never found
and their whereabouts are still unknown.

00:00:52.357 --> 00:00:53.892
We thought we had

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:58.196
{\an8}hidden that gun away with the crime
that the four of us committed

00:00:58.263 --> 00:00:59.864
{\an8}when we were in elementary school.

00:01:00.698 --> 00:01:01.566
But…

00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:05.103
The gun that was lost 23 years ago

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.838
was used in the recent incident,

00:01:06.905 --> 00:01:08.773
which is a very serious matter.

00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:20.451
That gun brought forth our reunion.

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.409
There are 14 security cameras installed
throughout the store,

00:01:44.475 --> 00:01:47.178
and all of the footage is recorded here.

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:49.981
Where is the recorded footage stored?

00:01:50.682 --> 00:01:51.950
In the computer over here.

00:01:56.521 --> 00:01:59.691
Please show me the footage
from January 16th.

00:01:59.757 --> 00:02:00.959
January 16th.

00:02:01.626 --> 00:02:02.660
Here it is.

00:02:03.228 --> 00:02:07.599
Detective Tobina,
what is camera number 14 filming?

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.872
{\an8}Inside the store from the back.

00:02:15.573 --> 00:02:16.908
It's the snack aisle.

00:02:17.575 --> 00:02:18.409
Just as I thought.

00:02:19.611 --> 00:02:23.548
Friday's footage from camera number 14
is the only one that's missing.

00:02:26.084 --> 00:02:27.585
I wonder if the footage

00:02:28.152 --> 00:02:30.955
contained something
that was inconvenient for someone?

00:02:33.057 --> 00:02:34.993
Ms. Makiko Iwamoto

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.229
is clearly lying.

00:02:39.797 --> 00:02:42.767
May I see the footage from January 17th?

00:02:42.834 --> 00:02:43.901
Yes, ma'am.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.238
Footage from camera 14 is here.

00:02:58.783 --> 00:03:02.553
Ms. Nara, why do you say
that Ms. Makiko Iwamoto is lying?

00:03:03.054 --> 00:03:05.189
She said that on Friday,
the day before the incident,

00:03:05.256 --> 00:03:09.427
she came to this supermarket
to give her son his wallet.

00:03:09.494 --> 00:03:13.064
My son called me
to say he had lost his wallet,

00:03:13.131 --> 00:03:14.966
so I went to give him some money.

00:03:15.033 --> 00:03:17.435
Your son called you on his smartphone?

00:03:17.502 --> 00:03:20.138
No, he doesn't have a smartphone.

00:03:20.204 --> 00:03:22.840
How did her son,
who doesn't own a smartphone,

00:03:22.907 --> 00:03:24.909
manage to contact her?

00:03:24.976 --> 00:03:26.544
A payphone?

00:03:26.611 --> 00:03:28.146
Where's the payphone?

00:03:28.846 --> 00:03:30.948
There are no payphones in this supermarket
or anywhere nearby,

00:03:31.616 --> 00:03:34.786
and besides, how can he make a call
at a payphone without his wallet or money?

00:03:34.852 --> 00:03:36.120
You're right.

00:03:42.126 --> 00:03:44.462
He might have used the landline here
at the supermarket.

00:03:46.564 --> 00:03:48.232
I'll request the call records.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.569
No need to request it.

00:03:53.271 --> 00:03:55.573
The call records should be arriving soon.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.376
Ms. Nara, we received the phone call
records from the supermarket.

00:03:58.443 --> 00:04:00.011
Please hand them to Detective Tobina.

00:04:01.145 --> 00:04:02.847
Yes.

00:04:16.894 --> 00:04:18.096
Come in.

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.834
There's a record of a call from the office
at Smile Sakuma to Ms. Iwamoto's salon.

00:04:23.568 --> 00:04:24.602
Here it is.

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.071
- Is that right?
- Yes.

00:04:27.138 --> 00:04:30.508
That doesn’t necessarily mean
that her son was the caller.

00:04:32.777 --> 00:04:33.945
Right.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.088
Hello?

00:04:44.856 --> 00:04:45.957
Makiko?

00:04:46.791 --> 00:04:48.626
- Junichi?
- Yeah.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.962
{\an8}What's up?

00:04:52.497 --> 00:04:53.798
{\an8}Um…

00:04:53.865 --> 00:04:54.966
{\an8}Oh,

00:04:55.533 --> 00:04:58.302
{\an8}am I being called to the station again?

00:04:59.937 --> 00:05:01.072
{\an8}No.

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:03.474
{\an8}Can we talk privately?

00:05:05.777 --> 00:05:06.911
{\an8}When?

00:05:08.646 --> 00:05:10.114
{\an8}Today, if possible?

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:12.817
Okay.

00:05:13.518 --> 00:05:16.721
Come to my shop. I’m available all day.

00:05:23.261 --> 00:05:25.530
I want to talk about the day
before the incident.

00:05:26.431 --> 00:05:28.166
Sure. Friday?

00:05:28.232 --> 00:05:29.434
Yeah.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.504
You said you went to the supermarket
after getting a call from your son.

00:05:34.238 --> 00:05:35.306
Yeah.

00:05:37.675 --> 00:05:39.944
Do you know where your son called from?

00:05:40.912 --> 00:05:43.815
From the supermarket, I guess.

00:05:43.881 --> 00:05:44.982
Which phone did he use?

00:05:46.384 --> 00:05:49.086
I don't know exactly where,

00:05:49.153 --> 00:05:51.722
but probably a phone
in the store's office or something.

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:53.057
Not a payphone?

00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:58.529
He couldn’t have used a payphone
since he didn’t have his wallet.

00:05:59.664 --> 00:06:00.932
Right.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.170
Wait, am I a suspect?

00:06:07.572 --> 00:06:08.840
No.

00:06:09.774 --> 00:06:10.942
It’s not like that.

00:06:11.008 --> 00:06:12.710
But you’re here as a detective, right?

00:06:16.914 --> 00:06:18.950
There’s no need for you to worry.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:20.685
It's all good.

00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:23.921
Oh really?

00:06:23.988 --> 00:06:25.356
Sorry to take up your time.

00:06:26.357 --> 00:06:28.993
Since you’re already here,

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.095
I’ll cut your hair.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.631
- Now?
- Yeah.

00:06:34.432 --> 00:06:35.500
But I’m on duty.

00:06:35.566 --> 00:06:37.768
No one would even notice.

00:06:37.835 --> 00:06:39.937
They will if I return
with a cleanly trimmed hairstyle.

00:06:40.004 --> 00:06:42.406
I won't give you
a cleanly trimmed hairstyle.

00:06:42.473 --> 00:06:44.375
I’ll give you a really unique,
and edgy hairstyle.

00:06:44.442 --> 00:06:46.944
That’ll be even more obvious.

00:06:47.011 --> 00:06:48.646
Junichi,

00:06:48.713 --> 00:06:51.349
you’re my childhood friend,
so I’ll only charge you 100,000 yen.

00:06:51.415 --> 00:06:52.850
That's too expensive.

00:06:52.917 --> 00:06:53.751
100,000 is insane.

00:06:53.818 --> 00:06:55.820
It's only natural to help each other out.

00:06:55.887 --> 00:06:58.122
- We're childhood friends after all.
- You're serious?

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:01.926
I sometimes cut Naoto’s hair too.

00:07:03.127 --> 00:07:04.462
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

00:07:05.396 --> 00:07:08.232
He brings me cake every time he comes.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.535
Mont Blanc?

00:07:11.102 --> 00:07:12.370
What?

00:07:12.436 --> 00:07:15.406
You remember that I like Mont Blanc?

00:07:16.874 --> 00:07:18.075
Yeah…

00:07:20.077 --> 00:07:21.746
It came to me just now.

00:07:23.681 --> 00:07:25.917
Then do you remember that as well?

00:07:26.951 --> 00:07:27.919
That?

00:07:28.986 --> 00:07:31.355
When you tried to kiss me.

00:07:31.923 --> 00:07:33.691
Have you kissed anyone before?

00:07:34.525 --> 00:07:35.593
What?

00:07:47.238 --> 00:07:49.240
By the way,

00:07:49.307 --> 00:07:51.909
I haven’t cut Keisuke’s hair

00:07:52.677 --> 00:07:55.212
since we divorced four years ago.

00:07:55.947 --> 00:07:59.717
Oh, it's not like we broke up
because we hated each other or anything.

00:07:59.784 --> 00:08:00.851
I see.

00:08:00.918 --> 00:08:03.854
We moved to my current house
after we got married.

00:08:04.789 --> 00:08:08.292
Keisuke was working
at an architectural firm in Yokohama,

00:08:08.993 --> 00:08:13.130
but he started a new firm in Tokyo
with a senior colleague.

00:08:13.764 --> 00:08:17.268
He got so busy that he wasn’t able
to come back here very often,

00:08:18.536 --> 00:08:21.339
so he suggested that we move to Tokyo.

00:08:22.139 --> 00:08:25.509
He said we could sell the current house,
buy an apartment in Tokyo,

00:08:25.576 --> 00:08:27.511
and find a tenant for this shop.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.650
But I had regular clients here,

00:08:34.118 --> 00:08:36.520
and there was also the matter of Masaki.

00:08:38.089 --> 00:08:39.824
Ever since elementary school,

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:43.227
he set his sights
on Hamadai Middle School in Yokohama,

00:08:43.294 --> 00:08:45.630
and he’d been attending cram school too.

00:08:47.398 --> 00:08:49.367
In the end,
neither of us would compromise,

00:08:49.867 --> 00:08:52.603
and couldn't reach an agreement,

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.005
so we decided to divorce.

00:08:59.977 --> 00:09:01.278
I see.

00:09:02.213 --> 00:09:03.414
What about you, Junichi?

00:09:04.382 --> 00:09:05.583
Are you married?

00:09:07.918 --> 00:09:10.588
- No.
- You have a girlfriend?

00:09:11.956 --> 00:09:12.957
Yeah.

00:09:14.592 --> 00:09:15.926
You do, huh?

00:09:16.961 --> 00:09:19.997
Hey, can the four of us
get together sometime?

00:09:20.064 --> 00:09:23.000
- You're changing the subject.
- That’s not it.

00:09:23.067 --> 00:09:24.435
I want the four of us to get together.

00:09:26.237 --> 00:09:27.672
Sounds good. When?

00:09:27.738 --> 00:09:28.839
Tomorrow.

00:09:30.441 --> 00:09:31.876
That’s short notice.

00:09:33.177 --> 00:09:35.179
Naoto's older brother's wake is tomorrow.

00:09:35.846 --> 00:09:39.016
I'm planning to go,
but what about you, Makiko?

00:09:40.484 --> 00:09:42.520
That’s tomorrow, huh?

00:09:42.586 --> 00:09:43.521
Yeah.

00:09:43.587 --> 00:09:45.322
Apparently it's a quiet event
for just family members.

00:09:47.725 --> 00:09:49.193
I see.

00:09:53.597 --> 00:09:54.999
Let’s all go.

00:10:00.304 --> 00:10:02.673
Can you tell Keisuke too?

00:10:04.408 --> 00:10:05.543
Okay.

00:10:08.779 --> 00:10:10.448
Come get a haircut again any time.

00:10:11.048 --> 00:10:12.183
Okay.

00:10:14.418 --> 00:10:17.288
- Then see you tomorrow.
- Okay, see you.

00:10:17.354 --> 00:10:18.456
Bye.

00:10:37.241 --> 00:10:38.409
You're back early.

00:10:39.176 --> 00:10:40.377
What's the matter?

00:10:40.978 --> 00:10:42.546
Hey there.

00:10:42.613 --> 00:10:44.248
Welcome home.

00:10:45.382 --> 00:10:47.051
I have to leave right away.

00:10:47.118 --> 00:10:48.586
I just came to get a change of clothes.

00:10:48.652 --> 00:10:49.820
What?

00:10:49.887 --> 00:10:52.490
Tomorrow, I have a meeting
and a wake in Mitsuba,

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:55.226
so I'll be staying there starting tonight.

00:10:59.296 --> 00:11:00.965
It’s for work, right?

00:11:03.734 --> 00:11:06.470
You've been going to Mitsuba a lot lately

00:11:06.537 --> 00:11:09.406
and of course, I know it's for work, but…

00:11:13.744 --> 00:11:15.446
Are you worried about Makiko and me?

00:11:19.917 --> 00:11:24.088
The only time Makiko and I meet up
is when it concerns our son Masaki.

00:11:25.156 --> 00:11:26.190
Yeah.

00:11:35.065 --> 00:11:38.202
Sorry for making you worry.

00:11:41.672 --> 00:11:42.640
How are you feeling?

00:11:44.308 --> 00:11:45.543
I'm okay.

00:11:46.677 --> 00:11:48.179
This little one is kicking a lot.

00:11:51.148 --> 00:11:52.283
It’s a healthy baby.

00:12:10.434 --> 00:12:13.737
Junichi came to confirm my story.

00:12:14.338 --> 00:12:16.006
You were able to handle it?

00:12:16.607 --> 00:12:17.474
Yeah.

00:12:19.243 --> 00:12:22.179
If the lie is going to be exposed
later on anyway,

00:12:24.548 --> 00:12:26.617
should we tell Junichi
about the shoplifting?

00:12:26.684 --> 00:12:29.153
We've already discussed this.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:33.157
We have to avoid anything that would
hinder Masaki's school acceptance.

00:12:33.224 --> 00:12:37.061
Besides, if we talk about the shoplifting,
we'll have to lie about the threats too.

00:12:41.899 --> 00:12:43.267
Okay.

00:12:44.401 --> 00:12:46.871
We won't tell Junichi about
the shoplifting or anything else.

00:12:52.409 --> 00:12:53.510
I need to tell Naoto

00:12:54.011 --> 00:12:57.781
to go along with our story too.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:14.865
How’s Masaki?

00:13:17.501 --> 00:13:21.939
I haven't been able to
get an explanation of why he shoplifted.

00:13:23.774 --> 00:13:24.842
Actually,

00:13:25.342 --> 00:13:27.211
I talked to Masaki about that already.

00:13:27.912 --> 00:13:29.046
What?

00:13:29.113 --> 00:13:31.715
He seemed to be in shock
because the person

00:13:31.782 --> 00:13:33.951
who caught him shoplifting was murdered.

00:13:35.452 --> 00:13:38.022
He told you why he shoplifted?

00:13:38.088 --> 00:13:39.123
Yeah.

00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:41.659
Apparently he got in a fight
with Hisashi Machida.

00:13:41.725 --> 00:13:42.626
Why?

00:13:44.295 --> 00:13:46.664
My best friend called me a nerd.

00:13:47.264 --> 00:13:48.499
Hisashi called you that?

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.202
He called me a clueless nerd.

00:13:52.269 --> 00:13:53.203
I see.

00:13:54.705 --> 00:13:57.574
So I tried to prove to him
that I'm not a nerd.

00:13:58.275 --> 00:13:59.710
He shoplifted for something like that?

00:13:59.777 --> 00:14:02.313
Don't say things like that
and corner Masaki, okay?

00:14:02.379 --> 00:14:04.415
This is a sensitive topic for guys.

00:14:04.481 --> 00:14:06.817
- So it’s my fault?
- What?

00:14:06.884 --> 00:14:10.454
Because I made him study hard,
to get him into Hamadai Middle School?

00:14:10.521 --> 00:14:12.589
I’m not saying that.

00:14:12.656 --> 00:14:14.491
You’re doing a really good job
with Masaki.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.362
If anyone is to blame, it's me.

00:14:19.096 --> 00:14:21.765
I hadn't been seeing Masaki
because of work.

00:14:29.807 --> 00:14:30.874
Then

00:14:32.276 --> 00:14:36.513
do you want to make today
your once-a-month visit?

00:14:41.418 --> 00:14:43.821
Sorry about what I said today.

00:14:50.561 --> 00:14:53.497
Sorry, I have to finish up some work.

00:14:56.767 --> 00:14:58.268
Okay.

00:15:00.104 --> 00:15:01.538
Here. Let's eat.

00:15:01.605 --> 00:15:03.407
Thank you.

00:15:03.474 --> 00:15:04.675
Why don't we

00:15:05.376 --> 00:15:06.810
go somewhere together next time?

00:15:09.013 --> 00:15:10.147
Like an amusement park.

00:15:10.681 --> 00:15:13.183
- No thanks.
- Really?

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:15.586
Is it too embarrassing
to hang out with your mom now?

00:15:15.652 --> 00:15:16.987
Of course.

00:15:17.988 --> 00:15:20.190
That's how it is, huh?

00:15:21.125 --> 00:15:23.627
I guess that's only natural.

00:15:29.233 --> 00:15:30.701
So, the gun

00:15:30.768 --> 00:15:34.405
is in the possession
of the person who killed Sakuma, right?

00:15:35.572 --> 00:15:38.976
- If the culprit didn't get rid of it yet.
- You're right.

00:15:39.043 --> 00:15:41.979
Wouldn't it be difficult
to keep something like that hidden?

00:15:42.046 --> 00:15:43.647
After all, it's a gun.

00:15:43.714 --> 00:15:46.383
Where would you even hide it?

00:15:47.117 --> 00:15:50.254
Oh man, I have absolutely no idea.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:55.559
If the person who took
Officer Kiyohara's gun 23 years ago

00:15:56.226 --> 00:15:59.930
is the same person who committed
this recent crime,

00:15:59.997 --> 00:16:02.199
it means the culprit was hiding it
all this time, right?

00:16:05.035 --> 00:16:08.172
If it’s not the same culprit, how did
the gun come to that person's possession?

00:16:14.044 --> 00:16:15.112
Ms. Nara.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.683
I'm going to Hideyuki Sakuma's
wake tomorrow night.

00:16:20.517 --> 00:16:22.486
I might be able to get some clues.

00:16:22.553 --> 00:16:24.154
Maybe I’ll go too.

00:16:24.221 --> 00:16:25.255
What?

00:16:26.924 --> 00:16:28.125
Actually, never mind.

00:16:28.659 --> 00:16:30.227
We’ll attract too much attention.

00:16:32.429 --> 00:16:35.432
Will your former classmates
be attending the wake too?

00:16:36.667 --> 00:16:37.868
I'm not sure.

00:16:38.569 --> 00:16:39.903
Is that right?

00:16:41.138 --> 00:16:42.172
Yes.

00:16:43.974 --> 00:16:45.342
Oh,

00:16:45.409 --> 00:16:48.212
if you bump into Ms. Makiko Iwamoto,

00:16:48.278 --> 00:16:49.813
try to get more information from her.

00:16:52.082 --> 00:16:53.550
About the lie she told.

00:16:55.119 --> 00:16:58.722
A mother went to the supermarket
to pick up her son.

00:16:59.256 --> 00:17:02.626
The security footage from that day
of the snack aisle is missing.

00:17:04.127 --> 00:17:06.330
Aside from returning a forgotten wallet,

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:09.166
you can probably think of another reason

00:17:09.766 --> 00:17:12.169
why a mother would go
to the supermarket, right?

00:17:13.337 --> 00:17:16.206
I'm sure I don't need
to spell it out for you. I'll be off now.

00:17:17.441 --> 00:17:18.542
Oh.

00:17:19.643 --> 00:17:21.111
Detective Tobina.

00:17:22.479 --> 00:17:24.314
This part of your hair is nicely trimmed.

00:17:36.793 --> 00:17:38.629
About the lie she told…

00:17:38.695 --> 00:17:41.131
Aside from returning a forgotten wallet,

00:17:41.765 --> 00:17:43.867
you can probably
think of another reason, right?

00:17:48.205 --> 00:17:49.173
You were here?

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:51.208
Welcome back.

00:17:51.942 --> 00:17:52.943
Thanks.

00:18:11.328 --> 00:18:12.496
What's the matter?

00:18:26.577 --> 00:18:29.179
You tried to kiss me.

00:18:34.618 --> 00:18:35.986
What are you cooking?

00:18:39.856 --> 00:18:41.391
I haven't decided yet.

00:18:42.192 --> 00:18:44.161
Maybe I'll make soup.

00:18:46.463 --> 00:18:47.564
Okay.

00:18:47.631 --> 00:18:49.099
Is work tough?

00:18:50.801 --> 00:18:51.902
No,

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:54.871
I just had it too easy until now.

00:18:55.739 --> 00:18:57.207
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

00:19:02.179 --> 00:19:03.947
You know the recent murder case?

00:19:05.515 --> 00:19:06.683
The victim…

00:19:10.687 --> 00:19:14.825
is the older brother of one of
my elementary school classmates.

00:19:16.126 --> 00:19:17.227
Wow.

00:19:18.629 --> 00:19:20.964
So you reunited with your classmate

00:19:21.898 --> 00:19:25.736
as a detective
and a victim's family member?

00:19:25.802 --> 00:19:26.703
Yeah.

00:19:27.271 --> 00:19:29.773
- For the first time in 23 years.
- Wow.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.908
What a strange coincidence.

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:36.980
Maybe the classmate is the suspicious one.

00:19:42.052 --> 00:19:44.521
- Maybe I'll have beer after all.
- Yeah.

00:19:46.923 --> 00:19:48.091
I know.

00:19:49.159 --> 00:19:51.094
I won't tell Junichi

00:19:52.062 --> 00:19:53.764
about Masaki's shoplifting incident.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:55.866
I'm sure they won't ask you about it,

00:19:56.466 --> 00:19:59.736
but if they do, you'll have to lie,
and I'm sorry about that.

00:20:01.204 --> 00:20:03.774
I should be the one
apologizing to you instead.

00:20:04.608 --> 00:20:05.909
What?

00:20:05.976 --> 00:20:08.145
My brother blackmailed you…

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.915
But I was on a business trip abroad,

00:20:12.649 --> 00:20:14.851
and I had left my smartphone in Japan,

00:20:14.918 --> 00:20:17.854
so I couldn't do anything to help you
at a time like that.

00:20:19.022 --> 00:20:20.424
Stop that.

00:20:21.291 --> 00:20:23.760
You always have my back.

00:20:28.465 --> 00:20:31.568
I'm sure you didn't want to come
to my brother's wake.

00:20:32.736 --> 00:20:34.671
{\an8}Nobody is saying it out loud,

00:20:34.738 --> 00:20:38.375
{\an8}but everyone in the family
is more relieved than sad that he's gone.

00:20:41.611 --> 00:20:45.282
My mother is not related to my brother
by blood so it's understandable,

00:20:46.183 --> 00:20:48.151
but even my father is relieved.

00:20:51.421 --> 00:20:52.989
- Keisuke.
- Hey.

00:20:53.056 --> 00:20:54.324
Keisuke is here.

00:20:59.129 --> 00:21:00.130
Junichi too.

00:21:15.946 --> 00:21:18.115
Express your emotions

00:21:18.181 --> 00:21:19.916
Give the reward

00:21:19.983 --> 00:21:21.284
To myself

00:21:21.351 --> 00:21:23.920
Face myself, make no mistake

00:21:23.987 --> 00:21:26.757
That's how I overcame it all

00:21:26.823 --> 00:21:29.893
Yes! I'm really cool! I'm so cool!

00:21:30.727 --> 00:21:34.097
I'm on a roll! I'm always…

00:21:35.599 --> 00:21:36.933
You're still here?

00:21:42.572 --> 00:21:43.507
Oh,

00:21:44.408 --> 00:21:46.009
where's Mr. Tobina?

00:21:48.912 --> 00:21:50.947
I'm sure he's at a reunion.

00:21:52.382 --> 00:21:53.216
What?

00:21:55.519 --> 00:21:58.889
I wonder where the gun went.

00:22:00.223 --> 00:22:01.425
Yes.

00:22:02.526 --> 00:22:05.762
I've been thinking about that too!

00:22:07.297 --> 00:22:09.733
If the late Officer Kiyohara knew

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.536
that his gun would be used years later
to commit murder,

00:22:12.602 --> 00:22:14.504
he wouldn't be able to die in peace.

00:22:15.305 --> 00:22:19.609
{\an8}The civilian who was killed
by a stray bullet at the bank

00:22:20.177 --> 00:22:22.412
is the one who can't rest in peace,
don't you think?

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:31.955
Are you okay?

00:22:37.694 --> 00:22:38.728
Yes…

00:22:40.397 --> 00:22:41.665
You're right.

00:22:43.033 --> 00:22:47.704
Thank you for coming today. Please drink.

00:22:48.205 --> 00:22:49.139
Thank you.

00:22:50.874 --> 00:22:53.276
Who would've thought
the four of us would meet again?

00:22:56.112 --> 00:22:57.047
Let's make a toast.

00:22:57.547 --> 00:22:59.683
A toast doesn't feel right.

00:22:59.749 --> 00:23:01.451
It's a wake after all.

00:23:01.518 --> 00:23:03.053
Don't worry about that.

00:23:03.119 --> 00:23:05.422
He was a good-for-nothing brother.

00:23:07.023 --> 00:23:09.960
Will I become a suspect if I say that
in front of the detective?

00:23:10.727 --> 00:23:12.929
I knew he was a lousy older brother
ever since we were kids.

00:23:15.832 --> 00:23:17.501
Maki, you'll drink beer, right?

00:23:17.567 --> 00:23:18.735
Thanks.

00:23:19.236 --> 00:23:20.604
I can't, I'm driving.

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:21.605
Okay.

00:23:22.272 --> 00:23:23.273
I'm okay too.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.374
All right.

00:23:31.181 --> 00:23:34.584
Let's make a toast
without saying "cheers."

00:23:35.285 --> 00:23:36.253
Then,

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.222
let's toast to our reunion.

00:23:49.499 --> 00:23:51.735
The three of us met from time to time,

00:23:51.801 --> 00:23:55.805
but we haven't seen Junichi
ever since we graduated.

00:23:55.872 --> 00:23:57.541
Although I saw him once in passing.

00:23:58.108 --> 00:23:59.976
- What?
- You saw me?

00:24:00.043 --> 00:24:02.812
I haven't heard about this.

00:24:02.879 --> 00:24:04.748
Where? When?

00:24:04.814 --> 00:24:06.416
He's like a detective interrogating me.

00:24:07.284 --> 00:24:09.052
He is a detective.

00:24:09.119 --> 00:24:11.621
When I saw him,
he was still a police officer.

00:24:11.688 --> 00:24:13.924
I think we were about 20.
I was still in university.

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:15.525
I was in Yokohama around then.

00:24:15.592 --> 00:24:16.459
Yeah.

00:24:16.526 --> 00:24:19.596
My friends and I left a pub in Yokohama,
and there was a fight going on outside.

00:24:19.663 --> 00:24:21.531
And a crowd of onlookers had gathered.

00:24:23.366 --> 00:24:25.435
Kiyohara, let's go to the after party.

00:24:25.502 --> 00:24:26.703
I'm not sure.

00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:29.406
Come on, let's go!

00:24:29.472 --> 00:24:31.207
- Why not?
- Make way!

00:24:31.274 --> 00:24:33.376
Make way, please.

00:24:33.443 --> 00:24:34.878
Make way, please. Excuse me.

00:24:34.945 --> 00:24:36.513
Watch out!

00:24:37.213 --> 00:24:38.515
Calm down. Tell us what happened.

00:24:38.582 --> 00:24:40.517
What happened? Calm down.

00:24:40.584 --> 00:24:42.319
Don't get violent with me.

00:24:42.385 --> 00:24:43.453
Don't get violent with me.

00:24:44.788 --> 00:24:46.022
You can't get violent.

00:24:46.089 --> 00:24:48.391
Just calm down.

00:24:48.458 --> 00:24:49.292
{\an8}‪Shut up!

00:24:50.527 --> 00:24:52.062
Stop it. Keep your hands to yourself.

00:24:55.065 --> 00:24:56.967
You gotta keep your hands to yourself.

00:24:57.033 --> 00:24:59.536
How cool!

00:24:59.603 --> 00:25:01.471
I can imagine Junichi doing that.

00:25:02.439 --> 00:25:05.175
- Why didn't you come talk to me?
- I couldn't.

00:25:05.842 --> 00:25:07.277
Oh right, I was on duty.

00:25:07.344 --> 00:25:08.578
It's not just that.

00:25:09.446 --> 00:25:12.782
I didn't want you to know that I was
going to mixers to escape boredom.

00:25:12.849 --> 00:25:15.452
What's up with that?

00:25:15.518 --> 00:25:17.554
Keisuke has always been like that.

00:25:20.056 --> 00:25:23.526
But Keisuke's dad would've been so happy

00:25:23.593 --> 00:25:25.962
if he knew that you became a detective.

00:25:27.263 --> 00:25:28.498
After all,

00:25:28.565 --> 00:25:31.668
you carried on his legacy.

00:25:31.735 --> 00:25:33.703
Not at all.

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:35.572
I could never carry on his legacy.

00:25:38.108 --> 00:25:40.477
- Good morning.
- Morning.

00:25:51.421 --> 00:25:55.892
I grew up without a dad,
so I got so attached to Keisuke's pops.

00:25:55.959 --> 00:25:57.427
Pops?

00:25:58.028 --> 00:25:59.863
- He always called him that, huh?
- Yeah.

00:25:59.929 --> 00:26:01.965
I called him "Dad,"

00:26:02.032 --> 00:26:04.968
but he called him "Pops."
Even though he was my dad.

00:26:05.035 --> 00:26:06.236
Pops.

00:26:07.537 --> 00:26:08.405
Sorry…

00:26:08.471 --> 00:26:11.041
He called him Pops!

00:26:11.107 --> 00:26:12.742
What is it, Junichi?

00:26:12.809 --> 00:26:16.680
Kendo was so much fun.

00:26:16.746 --> 00:26:20.183
Do you remember
the team competition in sixth grade?

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:22.686
How could we ever forget that?

00:26:22.752 --> 00:26:24.320
Naoto cried because he lost his match.

00:26:24.387 --> 00:26:25.455
Yeah.

00:26:25.522 --> 00:26:26.823
So I had no choice but to win.

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:29.726
At that moment,
Maki was a goddess in my eyes.

00:26:29.793 --> 00:26:31.394
You were so cool.

00:26:31.461 --> 00:26:34.164
I knew that if I won my match,
our team would win.

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:37.067
Yeah, since Keisuke and Junichi
were up next after Maki.

00:26:37.133 --> 00:26:38.735
So there was no way we'd lose.

00:26:43.139 --> 00:26:44.708
MITSUBA CITY KENDO CHAMPIONSHIP

00:26:46.376 --> 00:26:48.511
- All right!
- Match!

00:26:48.578 --> 00:26:50.947
- Hooray!
- You did it!

00:26:51.014 --> 00:26:52.882
Come back here!

00:26:53.483 --> 00:26:54.417
I'm so sorry.

00:26:55.251 --> 00:26:58.321
Keisuke, come back here now.
You too, Junichi!

00:27:00.156 --> 00:27:02.058
He got so mad at us for that.

00:27:02.125 --> 00:27:04.561
- Junichi!
- Yeah,

00:27:04.627 --> 00:27:06.629
because we were in the middle
of a competition.

00:27:06.696 --> 00:27:09.165
Of course Pops would get mad.

00:27:09.232 --> 00:27:10.633
- He's calling him Pops again.
- Pops.

00:27:13.136 --> 00:27:14.504
Sorry.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:21.211
That thing we always did after practice
was fun too, huh?

00:27:21.277 --> 00:27:22.312
Oh, that cafe?

00:27:22.378 --> 00:27:24.080
What was it called?

00:27:24.147 --> 00:27:25.448
- Saboten.
- Yeah!

00:27:25.515 --> 00:27:28.485
There was a broken arcade machine
that we played endlessly with one coin.

00:27:28.551 --> 00:27:29.652
Yeah, I remember that.

00:27:29.719 --> 00:27:31.521
Is that cafe still in business?

00:27:31.588 --> 00:27:33.423
Do you know, Naoto?

00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:34.691
I'm not sure.

00:27:34.758 --> 00:27:37.894
- Is the owner still alive? He was old.
- He was only like 50 back then.

00:27:37.961 --> 00:27:39.596
But he was so unfriendly.

00:27:39.662 --> 00:27:42.766
- Yeah, he sure was.
- Let's go see if it's still there.

00:27:42.832 --> 00:27:44.501
- What?
- What?

00:27:52.008 --> 00:27:55.311
His finger was totally inside the cup.

00:27:55.378 --> 00:27:57.814
‪His outfit hasn't changed at all.

00:27:57.881 --> 00:27:59.149
He hasn't changed at all.

00:27:59.215 --> 00:28:00.683
He's the same as 20 years ago.

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:02.185
He looks exactly the same.

00:28:02.252 --> 00:28:03.820
Yeah, he's still in shape.

00:28:03.887 --> 00:28:05.421
Whoa, look at this!

00:28:05.488 --> 00:28:06.723
- I remember this!
- Yeah me too!

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:08.792
How nostalgic!

00:28:08.858 --> 00:28:10.527
I got the lucky one.

00:28:10.593 --> 00:28:13.596
I bet the price hasn't changed either.

00:28:13.663 --> 00:28:15.665
- Never mind, it has.
- It changed.

00:28:15.732 --> 00:28:16.666
That's only natural.

00:28:16.733 --> 00:28:19.669
- The price went up.
- Understandable.

00:28:19.736 --> 00:28:20.770
What should we order?

00:28:21.704 --> 00:28:23.873
We've got to order our usual combo set.

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:26.276
- Yeah.
- Both the drink and the entree?

00:28:26.342 --> 00:28:27.977
- Of course!
- Of course!

00:28:28.044 --> 00:28:30.346
It's so much food.

00:28:32.382 --> 00:28:35.819
Speaking of which, Naoto, you always
took the cherry pits home with you,

00:28:35.885 --> 00:28:37.720
didn't you?

00:28:37.787 --> 00:28:40.023
Yeah, he did.

00:28:40.089 --> 00:28:42.826
You planted them, right?
What happened to them?

00:28:42.892 --> 00:28:44.761
Um…

00:28:46.396 --> 00:28:47.630
He didn't plant them.

00:28:47.697 --> 00:28:48.531
Why?

00:28:48.598 --> 00:28:52.235
Naoto took back the seeds and the stem,
and what he wanted was the stem.

00:28:52.769 --> 00:28:54.804
- The stem?
- Yeah.

00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:00.343
What are you guys laughing about?

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:02.912
I told Naoto that if he could tie the stem

00:29:02.979 --> 00:29:05.515
into a knot with his tongue,
he'd become a good kisser.

00:29:07.183 --> 00:29:09.586
You told him that?

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:15.258
Let's do it.

00:29:17.527 --> 00:29:19.996
Okay, give it a try.

00:29:21.331 --> 00:29:22.665
Seriously?

00:29:22.732 --> 00:29:24.100
You guys are idiots.

00:29:24.167 --> 00:29:27.871
- You practiced with the stems?
- I tried so hard to tie a knot.

00:29:27.937 --> 00:29:31.207
- I didn't think he'd really do it.
- No way, you knew he'd do it.

00:29:31.774 --> 00:29:32.642
Yeah.

00:29:33.243 --> 00:29:34.911
You're horrible.

00:29:35.411 --> 00:29:36.746
Oh.

00:29:36.813 --> 00:29:37.780
Really?

00:29:39.282 --> 00:29:40.750
- He did it.
- What?

00:29:40.817 --> 00:29:41.651
Are you serious?

00:29:41.718 --> 00:29:42.752
You tied it with your hands.

00:29:42.819 --> 00:29:44.988
No he didn't use his hands.
He's an amazing kisser now.

00:29:45.054 --> 00:29:47.991
- He's a really good kisser now.
- Ew!

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:52.195
Thank you very much.

00:29:52.262 --> 00:29:53.930
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:29:54.731 --> 00:29:57.934
We used to come here a lot

00:29:58.001 --> 00:30:00.303
- when we were young.
- Yes.

00:30:06.342 --> 00:30:07.577
Kendo, right?

00:30:09.379 --> 00:30:11.514
- What?
- You remember us?

00:30:12.348 --> 00:30:13.316
What?

00:30:17.687 --> 00:30:19.689
- Wait!
- No way!

00:30:19.756 --> 00:30:20.890
Look at this!

00:30:20.957 --> 00:30:23.526
- Wow! No way!
- This is so nostalgic.

00:30:23.593 --> 00:30:25.361
Ready,

00:30:25.428 --> 00:30:27.163
say cheese.

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:31.067
MITSUBA CITY KENDO CHAMPIONSHIP

00:30:31.134 --> 00:30:32.902
The Naoto we grew up with

00:30:32.969 --> 00:30:36.873
is now the next president
of the Sakuma Land Development Group.

00:30:38.041 --> 00:30:39.509
Not that I do anything special.

00:30:40.243 --> 00:30:41.144
Hey Naoto,

00:30:41.878 --> 00:30:44.981
you're building a big facility on the site
of our old elementary school, right?

00:30:45.048 --> 00:30:45.949
Yeah.

00:30:46.015 --> 00:30:48.151
Keisuke is in charge of the design.

00:30:48.217 --> 00:30:50.787
- I see.
- Yeah, it's a big project.

00:30:50.853 --> 00:30:52.422
Thank you, future President.

00:30:52.488 --> 00:30:54.023
Stop that.

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:55.625
It's all thanks to the future President?

00:30:55.692 --> 00:30:57.493
You too, Maki?

00:30:58.394 --> 00:31:01.597
Keisuke's company
won the rights, fair and square.

00:31:03.399 --> 00:31:07.070
But why a shopping mall
and a community center all of a sudden?

00:31:07.136 --> 00:31:10.273
The gymnasium was used
for a day care center up until now, right?

00:31:11.941 --> 00:31:16.045
Well, the building had to be demolished
because it was old and dilapidated.

00:31:16.112 --> 00:31:17.814
Construction will start soon.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.015
What will happen to that?

00:31:20.416 --> 00:31:21.551
The protesters?

00:31:21.617 --> 00:31:22.685
No…

00:31:25.221 --> 00:31:26.189
Our time capsule.

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.929
Let's go there right now.

00:31:33.763 --> 00:31:35.098
What?

00:31:35.164 --> 00:31:36.299
Let's open it…

00:31:37.667 --> 00:31:38.835
The time capsule.

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:41.738
Are you serious?

00:31:41.804 --> 00:31:44.173
- Why open it?
- The gun…

00:31:45.575 --> 00:31:48.678
Junichi, you're okay with it
since you're a detective?

00:31:48.745 --> 00:31:49.979
No way,

00:31:50.046 --> 00:31:51.781
in fact it'll be even worse for you.

00:31:51.848 --> 00:31:55.918
We hid the gun that caused such
a stir back then. If that gets out…

00:31:55.985 --> 00:31:57.320
Let's go.

00:32:01.958 --> 00:32:03.026
Let's go.

00:32:08.231 --> 00:32:10.299
Junichi never changes.

00:32:12.568 --> 00:32:13.870
Yeah.

00:32:15.872 --> 00:32:17.073
{\an8}Just a little further.

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:18.441
{\an8}- Where is it?
- A little further.

00:32:18.508 --> 00:32:20.309
{\an8}- Junichi.
- What?

00:32:20.376 --> 00:32:21.377
Let's go this way.

00:32:21.444 --> 00:32:24.013
- This way?
- Yeah.

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.182
It's closer that way.

00:32:26.249 --> 00:32:27.917
No, this way is closer.

00:32:27.984 --> 00:32:29.252
Just choose which way is best.

00:32:29.952 --> 00:32:31.087
Let's split into two groups.

00:32:31.587 --> 00:32:33.056
Only Keisuke and I know the route.

00:32:33.723 --> 00:32:36.292
- Which way do you want to go, Maki?
- Let's do rock, paper, scissors.

00:32:36.359 --> 00:32:38.061
Rock, paper, scissors.

00:32:38.127 --> 00:32:39.395
Rock, paper, scissors.

00:32:39.462 --> 00:32:40.797
- I got paper.
- Me too.

00:32:40.863 --> 00:32:41.898
You and me, Naoto.

00:32:41.964 --> 00:32:42.799
All right, let's go!

00:32:42.865 --> 00:32:44.734
What? Wait for me.

00:32:44.801 --> 00:32:45.435
Come on.

00:32:45.501 --> 00:32:46.436
- Hurry up, Naoto.
- Wait.

00:32:46.502 --> 00:32:47.370
- Naoto.
- Sorry.

00:32:47.437 --> 00:32:48.504
Come on, Naoto.

00:32:48.571 --> 00:32:49.405
Hurry up.

00:32:50.973 --> 00:32:51.808
‪Wow.

00:33:17.867 --> 00:33:18.935
Let's go.

00:33:30.913 --> 00:33:31.781
- You okay?
- Yeah.

00:33:38.788 --> 00:33:40.723
Keisuke. What's wrong?

00:33:42.191 --> 00:33:43.259
I don't know…

00:33:45.261 --> 00:33:48.097
But I heard

00:33:49.632 --> 00:33:51.200
a gunshot nearby.

00:33:53.636 --> 00:33:54.770
Wait…

00:33:56.072 --> 00:33:58.541
- Where's Naoto?
- He's behind me.

00:34:00.009 --> 00:34:01.310
Where's Naoto?

00:34:01.377 --> 00:34:02.345
What?

00:34:04.447 --> 00:34:06.415
NO TRESPASSING

00:34:06.482 --> 00:34:08.351
- Naoto!
- Naoto!

00:34:08.417 --> 00:34:10.520
Naoto!

00:34:10.586 --> 00:34:11.854
- I'll go look for him.
- Naoto!

00:34:11.921 --> 00:34:13.222
I'll go too.

00:34:17.426 --> 00:34:18.995
Maki, head back.

00:34:19.061 --> 00:34:20.763
Call the police.

00:34:21.697 --> 00:34:22.999
By myself?

00:34:26.636 --> 00:34:29.372
I'll look for Naoto.
Keisuke, you should go with her.

00:34:30.907 --> 00:34:31.974
What?

00:34:32.775 --> 00:34:34.177
Take care of Makiko.

00:34:38.247 --> 00:34:39.282
Okay.

00:34:42.051 --> 00:34:43.319
- Naoto!
- Makiko.

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.955
Let's go, Makiko.

00:34:46.489 --> 00:34:47.623
Come on, Makiko.

00:34:49.225 --> 00:34:50.493
Naoto.

00:34:51.661 --> 00:34:52.628
Naoto.

00:34:55.965 --> 00:34:57.900
Naoto.

00:35:00.036 --> 00:35:01.103
Naoto.

00:35:06.275 --> 00:35:07.910
What's the matter? Are you okay?

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.081
Can you walk over there?

00:35:13.482 --> 00:35:14.350
It's okay.

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:16.052
Take your time.

00:35:17.987 --> 00:35:18.955
It's okay.

00:35:20.189 --> 00:35:21.624
That's good.

00:35:22.191 --> 00:35:25.561
It's okay.

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:29.232
Sit here.

00:35:32.335 --> 00:35:33.436
Are you okay?

00:35:35.271 --> 00:35:36.205
Yeah.

00:35:39.108 --> 00:35:40.409
I'll go check things out.

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:42.745
You stay here.

00:35:43.679 --> 00:35:44.814
No, I'll go with you.

00:35:46.749 --> 00:35:47.583
It's all right.

00:36:12.541 --> 00:36:14.610
Junichi and Naoto are…

00:36:15.911 --> 00:36:17.913
Let's hurry and call the police.

00:36:18.981 --> 00:36:20.650
We're going to run away?

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:23.953
We're doing this
to save Junichi and Naoto.

00:36:27.857 --> 00:36:29.759
Then go by yourself, Keisuke.

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:32.395
Hurry!

00:36:48.778 --> 00:36:50.713
- Are you okay?
- Naoto.

00:36:51.747 --> 00:36:52.948
Are you okay?

00:36:53.749 --> 00:36:54.817
Where's Junichi?

00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:59.021
Where's Junichi?

00:37:12.101 --> 00:37:13.035
Junichi!

00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:17.106
- Is everything all right?
- Junichi.

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:20.976
- What's wrong?
- Where's the police?

00:37:21.043 --> 00:37:23.512
- Well…
- Call them right now.

00:37:24.246 --> 00:37:25.314
What happened?

00:37:26.816 --> 00:37:28.017
You shouldn't go over there.

00:37:34.924 --> 00:37:36.025
Don't go.

00:37:37.259 --> 00:37:38.461
Don't go.

00:37:40.996 --> 00:37:42.264
Junichi.

00:37:43.265 --> 00:37:44.633
Your pants are wet.

00:38:19.969 --> 00:38:21.003
Dad!

00:38:23.305 --> 00:38:24.573
Dad!

00:38:36.685 --> 00:38:38.621
I'll be leaving now! Bye!

00:38:39.622 --> 00:38:40.689
Detective Ito!

00:38:50.032 --> 00:38:50.866
I'm Nagai.

00:38:50.933 --> 00:38:53.569
Have you known Detective Tobina for long?

00:38:55.304 --> 00:38:58.474
I've known him ever since
he came here two months ago.

00:38:58.541 --> 00:39:02.278
In other words,
Detective Tobina came here,

00:39:02.978 --> 00:39:06.816
and shortly after,
the latest incident occurred?

00:39:07.516 --> 00:39:09.385
Yes, I guess so.

00:39:11.654 --> 00:39:13.255
I see.

00:39:16.692 --> 00:39:21.263
Dad!

00:39:21.964 --> 00:39:23.165
Dad!

00:39:23.232 --> 00:39:24.467
No!

00:39:24.533 --> 00:39:26.068
Dad!

00:39:26.635 --> 00:39:29.605
- No!
- Dad!

00:39:30.206 --> 00:39:33.275
- No!
- Dad!

00:39:33.342 --> 00:39:34.877
When I got here,

00:39:35.845 --> 00:39:37.046
it was too late.

00:39:40.416 --> 00:39:42.051
There's another dead person over there.

00:39:43.486 --> 00:39:45.120
I think it's the bank robber.

00:39:51.694 --> 00:39:53.128
My dad

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:55.831
took him down?

00:40:03.105 --> 00:40:03.939
I think so.

00:40:26.295 --> 00:40:27.196
Keisuke.

00:40:30.933 --> 00:40:32.568
- Keisuke.
- What are you doing?

00:40:36.772 --> 00:40:38.207
Keisuke!

00:40:49.785 --> 00:40:50.853
Keisuke!

00:41:20.049 --> 00:41:22.251
Will this really be all right?

00:41:22.318 --> 00:41:24.753
The detective is telling us to dig it up.

00:41:25.254 --> 00:41:27.456
But even if it's Junichi
telling us to do so,

00:41:28.757 --> 00:41:31.360
why do we need to dig it up
after all this time?

00:41:31.427 --> 00:41:32.728
No one else is around, right?

00:41:43.072 --> 00:41:45.207
What I'm about to tell you
is confidential information.

00:41:48.944 --> 00:41:52.414
I'm telling you this because
we are involved in this case,

00:41:53.048 --> 00:41:54.683
but I need you to keep this a secret.

00:41:57.152 --> 00:42:00.022
- What is it all of a sudden?
- You have to keep this between us.

00:42:02.491 --> 00:42:03.525
Promise me.

00:42:08.897 --> 00:42:10.232
Okay.

00:42:12.735 --> 00:42:14.103
I promise.

00:42:15.671 --> 00:42:16.872
I promise too.

00:42:20.009 --> 00:42:21.210
Naoto's older brother,

00:42:22.378 --> 00:42:24.446
Hideyuki Sakuma, was found dead…

00:42:26.715 --> 00:42:28.550
in the office

00:42:29.385 --> 00:42:31.153
above Smile Sakuma.

00:42:35.324 --> 00:42:38.394
The estimated time of death
is 10:00 p.m. on Saturday night.

00:42:39.862 --> 00:42:42.865
The owner of the hardware store next door
heard what sounded like a gunshot.

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:53.275
{\an8}The bullet extracted from the body
was fired

00:42:55.511 --> 00:42:56.845
{\an8}from Kazuo Kiyohara's…

00:42:59.982 --> 00:43:01.183
{\an8}From Pops'…

00:43:07.222 --> 00:43:10.759
{\an8}The bullet was fired from
the gun that belonged to Keisuke's father.

00:43:14.763 --> 00:43:16.265
{\an8}It was identified as his gun.

00:43:22.905 --> 00:43:23.739
{\an8}That can't be.

00:43:23.806 --> 00:43:24.907
{\an8}There's no doubt about it.

00:43:27.309 --> 00:43:29.011
{\an8}The gun that was placed
in the time capsule,

00:43:29.511 --> 00:43:31.213
{\an8}and buried here,

00:43:34.483 --> 00:43:36.351
{\an8}is the murder weapon that killed Sakuma.

00:44:00.609 --> 00:44:03.011
{\an8}The only ones who knew
about the buried gun,

00:44:04.279 --> 00:44:06.081
{\an8}were the four of us.

00:44:13.522 --> 00:44:15.691
‪At last, all the players will be present.

00:44:15.758 --> 00:44:17.993
{\an8}‪You're saying that I have an accomplice?

00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:19.528
{\an8}‪"Raise your hand, and I’ll arrest you."

00:44:19.595 --> 00:44:21.830
{\an8}‪-That's what you're saying!
‪-That's not what i'm saying!

00:44:21.897 --> 00:44:24.099
{\an8}‪I didn't open the time capsule.

00:44:24.166 --> 00:44:25.667
{\an8}‪Okay.

00:44:25.734 --> 00:44:26.835
{\an8}‪I believe you.

00:44:26.902 --> 00:44:27.936
{\an8}‪THIS DRAMA IS A FICTION

00:44:28.003 --> 00:44:28.837
