Actor Kang Eun Seok, known as "the nation's son-in-law,"

is now sending shockwaves after being sued by a minor,

00:02:21.902 --> 00:02:25.772
a high school student, on charges of sexual assault and battery.

00:02:30.742 --> 00:02:32.712
Mr. Kang! Do you admit to the sexual assault allegations?

00:02:32.782 --> 00:02:34.382
Did you know the victim was a minor?

00:02:34.452 --> 00:02:37.152
- Had you not met the victim before? - Mr. Kang!

00:02:37.222 --> 00:02:38.422
Do you admit it?

00:02:38.582 --> 00:02:42.852
This is ridiculous, Attorney Hwang. Why must Yoo Jeong go to court?

00:02:43.052 --> 00:02:45.492
We already recorded her video statement.

00:02:45.562 --> 00:02:46.832
That jerk, Kang Eun Seok...

00:02:48.632 --> 00:02:53.262
He demanded she appear in person. He won't accept her video testimony.

00:02:53.502 --> 00:02:55.732
So the victim has to show up just because the accused demands it?

00:02:56.202 --> 00:03:00.712
Yoo Jeong's a high school student. How can she testify with him there?

00:03:00.812 --> 00:03:04.012
I've requested a privacy screen and confirmed it's been set up.

00:03:04.112 --> 00:03:06.242
She'll also be using the judges' private entrance,

00:03:06.342 --> 00:03:09.112
so she won't have to see Kang Eun Seok's face in court.

00:03:11.922 --> 00:03:13.522
What kind of justice system...

00:03:13.892 --> 00:03:15.092
It's messed up, right?

00:03:16.652 --> 00:03:17.962
But if you fall apart,

00:03:19.062 --> 00:03:20.332
what will Yoo Jeong do?

00:03:21.132 --> 00:03:23.932
We're strong. And his dirty tricks won't faze us.

00:03:24.302 --> 00:03:26.502
We have to show her that. Right?

00:03:40.182 --> 00:03:41.382
Yoo Jeong.

00:03:42.212 --> 00:03:43.412
Are you in there?

00:03:56.792 --> 00:04:00.732
Attorney Hwang, I just want to go home.

00:04:02.532 --> 00:04:03.872
We will.

00:04:04.102 --> 00:04:07.572
Right after you bravely testify and get this weight off your chest.

00:04:10.512 --> 00:04:14.682
There's nothing to be scared of. Just think of it like our practice.

00:04:15.482 --> 00:04:18.882
I'll be right by your side through the entire trial,

00:04:19.552 --> 00:04:22.422
and you won't let them get to you or scare you.

00:04:22.922 --> 00:04:25.122
Because we've prepared for every possible question.

00:04:25.962 --> 00:04:28.132
All you have to do is tell the truth.

00:04:31.032 --> 00:04:32.232
Let's go.

00:04:34.002 --> 00:04:35.232
Attorney Hwang.

00:04:35.772 --> 00:04:36.972
Yes?

00:04:37.742 --> 00:04:38.942
It's nothing.

00:04:45.412 --> 00:04:49.182
In many sexual assault cases, their testimony is the only proof.

00:04:49.582 --> 00:04:53.082
What if a victim falsely claims they were raped or molested,

00:04:53.422 --> 00:04:55.822
exaggerating their testimony or trying to frame the accused?

00:04:56.192 --> 00:04:59.162
Without cross-examination, how can we challenge that testimony?

00:04:59.722 --> 00:05:02.992
Should we trust testimony by default just because it's from a minor?

00:05:03.432 --> 00:05:06.332
A defendant's right to a defense is guaranteed by the Constitution.

00:05:06.662 --> 00:05:09.832
From a judicial standpoint, I believe this ruling was correct.

00:05:10.002 --> 00:05:13.172
Attorney Yoon, what is your response to Attorney Lee's opinion?

00:05:13.472 --> 00:05:16.242
I'm sorry, what was that? What did Attorney Lee say?

00:05:16.342 --> 00:05:18.312
About the defendant's right to a defense.

00:05:18.682 --> 00:05:19.882
The right to a defense?

00:05:20.212 --> 00:05:22.612
It was so dreadfully boring, I'm afraid I tuned out.

00:05:23.482 --> 00:05:24.682
Attorney Yoon.

00:05:24.752 --> 00:05:28.722
You're not taking this debate very seriously today, Attorney Yoon.

00:05:29.092 --> 00:05:32.522
Why don't you try me again? I'll be sure to listen this time.

00:05:33.362 --> 00:05:36.932
- The nerve. - Don't want to? Then I'll ask one.

00:05:37.202 --> 00:05:38.702
Yes. Go ahead.

00:05:39.132 --> 00:05:41.702
Attorney Lee, why are you even here?

00:05:42.372 --> 00:05:44.042
What's that supposed to mean?

00:05:44.972 --> 00:05:47.412
I'm just wondering if you're here to drum up business, like on YouTube.

"Win Rape Cases. Beat a Rape Case." "Acquitted of Child Sex Crimes."

00:05:52.412 --> 00:05:55.182
You made a fortune on sex crimes and bought a building with it.

00:05:55.812 --> 00:05:57.322
So why bother coming on TV?

00:05:58.582 --> 00:06:00.452
Oh, the mortgage.

00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:03.222
Interest rates went up? Are things getting a little tight?

00:06:03.292 --> 00:06:05.992
How dare you speak to me like that, Attorney Yoon?

00:06:06.092 --> 00:06:07.392
But you do the same thing, don't you?

00:06:07.692 --> 00:06:10.602
You use these kinds of insults, threats,

00:06:10.602 --> 00:06:12.432
and intentionally badger victims in the courtroom.

00:06:37.362 --> 00:06:40.692
"You were on depression medication after the assault. Why call 911?"

00:06:40.792 --> 00:06:43.062
"You didn't want to die, did you? You were just acting, weren't you?"

00:06:44.432 --> 00:06:47.432
Just exercising the defendant's right to a defense, right?

00:06:48.232 --> 00:06:49.432
Bravo.

00:06:52.472 --> 00:06:54.542
Over 80 percent of sexual assault victims...

00:06:54.542 --> 00:06:56.612
face secondary trauma in court.

00:06:56.942 --> 00:07:00.142
And because of that secondary victimization in the courtroom,

00:07:00.682 --> 00:07:02.282
they end up dropping their cases.

00:07:03.922 --> 00:07:05.382
That's the impact of the Constitutional Court's ruling.

00:07:05.982 --> 00:07:10.122
"You liked it, right? Why not run? How could a victim possibly smile?"

00:07:11.762 --> 00:07:12.962
That kind of nonsense...

00:07:13.762 --> 00:07:16.832
is what children now have to hear in a courtroom.

(Courtroom 413)

00:07:41.122 --> 00:07:42.292

Yoo Jeong.

00:07:52.932 --> 00:07:54.132
Now, witness.

00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:56.972
Witness, you claim that on the day you met the defendant at Club Eyes,

00:07:57.142 --> 00:08:00.342
you were sexually abused and beaten at his home,

00:08:00.442 --> 00:08:02.312
and you took a month to heal. Is that correct?

00:08:03.272 --> 00:08:05.882
And is every part of your testimony so far unequivocally true?

00:08:06.842 --> 00:08:09.512
- Yes. - Why did you go to his home?

00:08:09.882 --> 00:08:11.722
You knew you'd be alone with him, didn't you?

00:08:12.752 --> 00:08:15.192
Did you not implicitly consent to have sex?

00:08:16.892 --> 00:08:20.422
He said he was going to give me a tour of his place.

00:08:20.932 --> 00:08:24.162
And I took him at his word.

00:08:24.632 --> 00:08:27.332
Witness, you're not a virgin, are you?

00:08:29.602 --> 00:08:31.702
Objection. The question's irrelevant and inflammatory.

00:08:31.772 --> 00:08:36.172
The question is to ascertain if the witness sufficiently resisted.

00:08:37.042 --> 00:08:40.182
- Overruled. Witness will answer. - Darn...

00:08:40.482 --> 00:08:41.912
He's every bit the scumbag I expected.

00:08:42.282 --> 00:08:43.512
Don't get rattled.

00:08:44.452 --> 00:08:45.652
Stay calm.

00:08:50.222 --> 00:08:53.962
The entire time he was raping me,

00:08:54.162 --> 00:08:57.602
I begged for my life and never stopped fighting back.

00:08:59.202 --> 00:09:02.602
The photos of my injuries are proof of that.

00:09:05.702 --> 00:09:07.102

00:09:09.112 --> 00:09:10.312

(Haeil Law Firm)

00:09:16.052 --> 00:09:19.182
In the past month, because of the Kang Eun Seok case,

00:09:19.282 --> 00:09:22.922
378 articles have been published linking him to LnJ and Haeil.

00:09:23.092 --> 00:09:27.022
And online negativity toward Haeil has increased by 35 percent.

00:09:27.432 --> 00:09:31.432
Why is it always sex crimes? LnJ is already a money pit,

00:09:31.532 --> 00:09:34.272
and you'll bring a swarm of flies into our own backyard?

00:09:34.472 --> 00:09:36.332
Then what should we be doing, making wine in a pickle barrel?

00:09:38.872 --> 00:09:42.612
LnJ was founded initially to help female victims of crime.

00:09:42.842 --> 00:09:44.882
As you all remember, that was decided ten years ago,

00:09:44.882 --> 00:09:46.982
with this board's full approval.

00:09:48.182 --> 00:09:52.152
Besides, are you sure all this heat is just over the Kang Eun Seok case?

00:09:52.422 --> 00:09:55.692
From where I'm sitting, it's about the Dongsung Chemical cover-up.

00:09:56.122 --> 00:09:59.592
Or was it because of the acquittal of the vacuum sterilizer company?

00:10:00.492 --> 00:10:01.692
CEO Kang...

00:10:02.132 --> 00:10:06.562
In the past decade, Haeil funneled over ten million dollars to LnJ.

00:10:06.802 --> 00:10:10.232
If you're going to speak that way about a public interest firm...

00:10:10.332 --> 00:10:13.072
What then? Should I go hold a bake sale?

00:10:16.642 --> 00:10:19.042
If you make the powerless suffer with one hand,

00:10:19.682 --> 00:10:21.652
then you need to wipe away their tears with the other.

00:10:21.952 --> 00:10:25.722
We may not be profitable, but I save you money in the long run.

00:10:25.852 --> 00:10:27.292
On top of that, I also launder your image.

00:10:27.452 --> 00:10:30.622
Social value, public interest, human rights.

00:10:30.722 --> 00:10:34.662
Is there any other subsidiary that boosts our CSR score like LnJ?

00:10:35.332 --> 00:10:38.362
Kang Eun Seok's company is planning to acquire S Entertainment.

00:10:38.532 --> 00:10:40.672
And Haeil was supposed to get a piece of that.

00:10:41.002 --> 00:10:43.102
But thanks to you and your team, the acquisition rights...

00:10:43.272 --> 00:10:46.242
will now go to Myeonghan, the firm defending Kang Eun Seok.

00:10:46.342 --> 00:10:49.912
Do you have any idea how much money we just lost because of LnJ?

00:10:49.972 --> 00:10:53.282
Is the Kang Eun Seok case worth taking this kind of hit?

00:10:53.512 --> 00:10:57.852
Yes. Even if his company offered us half of Korea's entertainment world,

00:10:57.952 --> 00:10:59.152
I would still insist on taking this case.

00:11:00.422 --> 00:11:01.622
And why is that?

00:11:05.062 --> 00:11:06.262
Because that man...

00:11:06.862 --> 00:11:08.062
is a total jerk.

00:11:11.032 --> 00:11:13.832
Stop Myeonghan from winning the Kang Eun Seok case.

00:11:14.102 --> 00:11:17.472
Or I'm cutting LnJ's budget by 50 percent.

00:11:41.562 --> 00:11:43.062
That's not where you belong.

00:11:45.062 --> 00:11:46.262
You're wrong.

00:11:46.902 --> 00:11:48.132
This is exactly where I belong.

00:11:48.872 --> 00:11:50.072
It's been ten years.

00:11:51.342 --> 00:11:53.902
Isn't it about time you stopped wasting your life and came back?

00:11:54.242 --> 00:11:57.412
After ten years, it's about time you learned to give up, Mom.

00:11:58.782 --> 00:12:02.382
Don't forget. I raised you to lead Haeil.

00:12:15.932 --> 00:12:19.032
It's the same argument every time. It's so exhausting.

00:12:20.432 --> 00:12:22.032
For all your complaining, you seem to handle them just fine.

00:12:22.372 --> 00:12:24.242
LnJ has been around for ten years now.

00:12:24.802 --> 00:12:27.142
An attack like this is no big deal anymore.

00:12:36.052 --> 00:12:37.882
So this is what you have to show for your ten years?

00:12:39.252 --> 00:12:42.922
See? Like I said, an attack like this is no big deal.

00:12:45.522 --> 00:12:47.362
Wait, you're not even going to wipe this off before you get in?

00:12:49.392 --> 00:12:51.902
You think they'd have used something that just wipes right off, Mom?

00:12:52.532 --> 00:12:54.072
(Witch)

00:12:59.742 --> 00:13:02.442
Has the defense concluded its cross-examination?

00:13:02.712 --> 00:13:05.642
No, Your Honor. I have one last, crucial question.

00:13:05.712 --> 00:13:07.012
(Witness stand)

00:13:07.242 --> 00:13:08.452
Witness.

00:13:08.982 --> 00:13:12.422
Is everything you've said so far the absolute truth?

00:13:13.352 --> 00:13:15.092
Yes, it is.

00:13:15.652 --> 00:13:16.852
Then let me ask you this.

00:13:17.392 --> 00:13:21.362
Witness. Are you absolutely certain you met the defendant at the club?

00:13:27.832 --> 00:13:29.102
Answer the question.

00:13:29.602 --> 00:13:31.542
Did you meet the defendant at Club Eyes?

00:13:34.002 --> 00:13:38.642
This is the Club Eyes entrance CCTV and the entry log from that night.

00:13:39.512 --> 00:13:42.412
Nowhere in this footage...

00:13:42.512 --> 00:13:44.522
or on this log can we find the witness's name or face.

00:13:44.982 --> 00:13:48.292
And there isn't a single witness who saw the two of them together.

00:13:48.652 --> 00:13:51.322
Objection, Your Honor! This wasn't disclosed in discovery.

00:13:52.222 --> 00:13:53.922
Counsel, please submit it as evidence.

00:14:00.232 --> 00:14:04.302
Prosecutor, prepare a response for the next hearing.

00:14:06.872 --> 00:14:08.072
Witness.

00:14:08.472 --> 00:14:11.642
Did you or did you not meet him at Club Eyes?

00:14:13.512 --> 00:14:14.912
Answer the question, Witness.

00:14:16.982 --> 00:14:18.182
Witness.

00:14:20.052 --> 00:14:21.252
Answer me.

00:14:22.452 --> 00:14:23.652
No.

00:14:25.662 --> 00:14:29.532
Then can you tell the court where and how you first met him?

00:14:32.702 --> 00:14:34.332
Witness, you must answer the question.

00:14:34.802 --> 00:14:36.432
How did you first meet the defendant?

00:14:48.212 --> 00:14:49.412
Yoo Jeong.

00:14:50.152 --> 00:14:53.182
This witness made false statements since the initial investigation.

00:14:53.522 --> 00:14:58.162
She claimed a famous Korean actor sexually assaulted and battered her.

00:14:58.262 --> 00:15:01.332
How can we possibly trust her one-sided testimony any further?

00:15:02.162 --> 00:15:05.402
Witness, where did you meet the defendant?

00:15:07.032 --> 00:15:10.772
As I've already stated, I was extremely intoxicated,

00:15:11.202 --> 00:15:12.602
so I have no recollection.

00:15:13.902 --> 00:15:18.682
Could she have seen you were drunk and approached you intentionally?

00:15:20.212 --> 00:15:21.582
I suppose that's possible.

00:15:22.352 --> 00:15:25.352
There's no way she wouldn't have recognized me.

00:15:26.122 --> 00:15:28.222
That would explain everything.

00:15:29.652 --> 00:15:31.292
If she was after his money from the start...

00:15:31.392 --> 00:15:32.822
That's baseless speculation.

00:15:32.892 --> 00:15:35.532
Counsel, you may only speak when you're recognized by the court.

00:15:37.862 --> 00:15:39.062
Wait.

00:15:39.562 --> 00:15:41.032
I do remember something now.

00:15:50.312 --> 00:15:51.482
The sound of her voice.

00:16:13.932 --> 00:16:15.132
An Americano, please.

00:16:22.612 --> 00:16:23.812
Jun Hyeok?

00:16:25.012 --> 00:16:26.212
Attorney Yoon.

00:16:27.442 --> 00:16:30.052
I haven't seen you in ages! What brings you here?

00:16:30.512 --> 00:16:32.552
I'm meeting someone.

00:16:32.652 --> 00:16:34.322
Working on a story? You should've hit me up...

00:16:34.322 --> 00:16:35.622
when you were in the neighborhood.

00:16:35.722 --> 00:16:38.062
Your breakup with Hyun Jin is no reason to cut us off.

00:16:38.062 --> 00:16:39.162
You're so cold.

00:16:39.692 --> 00:16:40.892
I've just been busy.

00:16:41.262 --> 00:16:43.462
You made a big splash again today. Are you okay?

00:16:43.562 --> 00:16:46.802
Why wouldn't I be? The networks are happy with ratings,

00:16:46.862 --> 00:16:51.042
the public has a new target, and I love having a bigger audience.

00:16:51.172 --> 00:16:52.372
It's a win-win.

00:16:54.672 --> 00:16:56.472
Hyun Jin's doing well, by the way.

00:16:58.682 --> 00:17:00.512
Just in case you were wondering.

00:17:02.482 --> 00:17:04.982
Glad to hear it. We should grab a bite sometime.

00:17:05.652 --> 00:17:06.982
I'd love to see CEO Kang too.

00:17:13.192 --> 00:17:14.392
(Jo Yoo Jeong)

00:17:18.932 --> 00:17:20.132
Hang on a second.

00:17:22.972 --> 00:17:24.172
5887?

00:17:28.512 --> 00:17:30.072
(Jo Yoo Jeong)

00:17:40.152 --> 00:17:42.252
I've got to run. I'll be in touch.

00:17:42.692 --> 00:17:43.952
What's the story?

00:17:44.292 --> 00:17:46.562
Jun Hyeok, you're on Jo Yoo Jeong, aren't you? She's our client.

00:17:48.132 --> 00:17:49.332
Talk to you later.

00:17:57.602 --> 00:17:59.272
(Kang Eun Seok is innocent! Punish the lying accuser!)

00:17:59.372 --> 00:18:01.002
(Kang Eun Seok is the real victim!)

00:18:07.412 --> 00:18:09.282
(Scales of justice are tilted.)

00:18:10.682 --> 00:18:11.952
Attorney Yoon. You're back.

00:18:12.522 --> 00:18:13.952
Are these from Kang Eun Seok's fans?

00:18:14.692 --> 00:18:17.822
- Yes. - Leave them. They brighten it up.

00:18:17.922 --> 00:18:19.392
(Until Kang Eun Seok's name is cleared...)

00:18:21.762 --> 00:18:24.192
We never leaked that picture of Kang Eun Seok's hair loss,

00:18:24.292 --> 00:18:26.502
and of course we weren't the ones who posted it...

00:18:26.562 --> 00:18:28.572
- Keep up the good work, everyone. - That wasn't us.

00:18:28.732 --> 00:18:30.132
Yes, this is the LnJ Law Firm.

00:18:30.332 --> 00:18:31.702
If you keep acting like this,

00:18:31.702 --> 00:18:33.442
- Yes. - we'll have to take legal actions.

00:18:33.442 --> 00:18:34.612
I understand that,

00:18:35.112 --> 00:18:37.842
but you can't just be so unreasonable...

00:18:49.952 --> 00:18:51.162
You're back?

00:18:51.762 --> 00:18:52.962
Yes.

00:18:57.362 --> 00:19:00.002
- How was court? - A nightmare.

00:19:00.462 --> 00:19:01.772
Let's talk about it when Shin Jae gets here.

00:19:02.372 --> 00:19:03.572
(Jo Yoo Jeong)

00:19:05.502 --> 00:19:08.112
We've got another ton of comments to save as PDFs today.

00:19:09.042 --> 00:19:11.442
- For Yoo Jeong? - No, for you.

00:19:11.712 --> 00:19:13.482
You've got Kang Eun Seok beat.

00:19:14.682 --> 00:19:16.112
Seriously, the comments about you are way worse.

00:19:16.982 --> 00:19:18.182
Makes me so proud.

00:19:19.182 --> 00:19:21.052
Nothing about Yoo Jeong's identity has been leaked online, right?

00:19:21.152 --> 00:19:22.352
I'm keeping an eye on it.

00:19:27.362 --> 00:19:31.032
- How was the committee meeting? - Same old, same old.

00:19:39.702 --> 00:19:41.872
My blood sugar is crashing.

00:19:42.342 --> 00:19:44.612
- Let's get some food. - What should we get?

00:19:45.382 --> 00:19:46.582
Something delicious.

00:19:50.312 --> 00:19:53.852
- Can this food get any better? - Never.

00:19:54.952 --> 00:19:58.122
This tastes like what we used to eat after school as kids.

00:20:00.492 --> 00:20:02.392
This is the only thing I crave when I'm stressed out.

00:20:02.892 --> 00:20:06.232
But why would Jo Yoo Jeong lie?

00:20:07.102 --> 00:20:10.872
If not at a club, where? A dating app? Social media?

00:20:10.932 --> 00:20:12.142
No, that's not it.

00:20:12.242 --> 00:20:13.442
They even ran forensics on his phone.

00:20:13.542 --> 00:20:15.572
The prosecution said it was clean.

00:20:15.712 --> 00:20:17.772
And Yoo Jeong refuses to say a single word.

00:20:18.082 --> 00:20:20.082
If we can't figure out where they met,

00:20:20.182 --> 00:20:21.982
Kang Eun Seok is just going to walk free.

00:20:23.012 --> 00:20:24.212
I thought you said you hated spicy food.

00:20:24.282 --> 00:20:25.582
And I thought you were on a diet.

00:20:26.022 --> 00:20:28.852
Don't you know I've been all talk for 20 years?

00:20:28.922 --> 00:20:31.862
Exactly. That makes me a good friend for 20 years.

00:20:31.962 --> 00:20:34.862
Hey, thanks to you, I haven't dieted since college.

00:20:34.962 --> 00:20:36.992
Here, eat up.

00:20:37.062 --> 00:20:39.202
Anyway, if we lose the first trial,

00:20:39.202 --> 00:20:41.502
Kang Eun Seok will likely countersue.

00:20:41.672 --> 00:20:45.542
She won't talk, even facing perjury, false charges.

00:20:46.542 --> 00:20:47.742
What is going on?

00:20:49.942 --> 00:20:52.742
I think Jun Hyeok has been in contact with Yoo Jeong.

00:20:54.042 --> 00:20:57.112
- Did you see Reporter Lee? - Yes, I saw him on my way in.

00:20:59.022 --> 00:21:00.422
He seemed to be doing well.

00:21:03.992 --> 00:21:06.522
I'm sure he is.

00:21:08.592 --> 00:21:10.332
Wait, what do you mean?

00:21:10.332 --> 00:21:12.362
Jun Hyeok's in contact with Yoo Jeong?

00:21:12.962 --> 00:21:16.272
I saw him get a call from her. I think that's why he was here.

00:21:17.572 --> 00:21:21.142
Why don't you go talk to him? He might know something.

00:21:22.642 --> 00:21:24.172
What's the big deal? It's for work.

00:21:27.542 --> 00:21:31.322
Yes. We broke up ages ago. I'll go talk to him.

00:21:32.322 --> 00:21:34.252
You deleted his number, didn't you? Want me to send it?

00:21:34.922 --> 00:21:36.122
Yes.

00:21:42.292 --> 00:21:44.062
(Lee Jun Hyeok)

00:21:53.372 --> 00:21:56.572
What do I do? The trial was a complete disaster.

00:21:57.412 --> 00:22:00.442
Maybe it's better to tell the truth, even now...

00:22:00.742 --> 00:22:02.652
But you know what will happen.

00:22:03.452 --> 00:22:04.852
If I tell the truth,

00:22:05.752 --> 00:22:08.422
they'll come after me.

00:22:09.522 --> 00:22:10.952
I'm terrified.

00:22:12.422 --> 00:22:14.192
What am I supposed to do now, Reporter Lee?

00:22:33.942 --> 00:22:35.382
(Hyun Jin)

00:22:41.822 --> 00:22:44.692
If it's too late, I can come back another time.

00:22:45.322 --> 00:22:46.522
Come on in.

00:23:01.172 --> 00:23:02.372
You look good.

00:23:04.942 --> 00:23:06.682
I am. I'm happy.

00:23:20.522 --> 00:23:21.732
Help me.

00:23:22.592 --> 00:23:24.192
That's what I came here to say.

00:23:25.132 --> 00:23:27.302
You've been talking to Jo Yoo Jeong, haven't you?

00:23:30.872 --> 00:23:33.642
I can't figure out where Yoo Jeong met Kang Eun Seok.

00:23:34.302 --> 00:23:36.672
She's terrified of something and refuses to talk.

00:23:37.342 --> 00:23:40.212
At this rate, the charges against Kang Eun Seok won't stick.

00:23:42.582 --> 00:23:44.482
You know something, don't you?

00:23:48.092 --> 00:23:49.292
Everything you know...

00:23:50.222 --> 00:23:51.722
is everything I know.

00:23:57.892 --> 00:24:00.732
Jun Hyeok. We were together for seven years.

00:24:01.362 --> 00:24:05.042
We were together for way too long not to know when you're lying.

00:24:08.242 --> 00:24:10.572
Help me out. Please.

00:24:16.982 --> 00:24:18.182
More tea?

00:24:21.622 --> 00:24:22.822
I'm telling the truth.

00:24:23.152 --> 00:24:27.092
I met Jo Yoo Jeong through the Kang Eun Seok case. That's it.

00:24:29.492 --> 00:24:32.202
So there is something else.

00:24:33.002 --> 00:24:36.172
Something much bigger behind Jo Yoo Jeong.

00:24:39.902 --> 00:24:43.942
I got you this in France, remember? Nike, the goddess of victory.

00:24:44.782 --> 00:24:45.942
- That's... - You said...

00:24:46.012 --> 00:24:49.812
it brought you good luck. You'd put it here for a big scoop.

00:24:50.482 --> 00:24:52.682
Like the presidential candidate's slush fund scandal.

00:24:52.782 --> 00:24:54.652
And when you broke the story on that secret political advisor.

00:24:55.852 --> 00:24:58.522
What is it? What exactly are you digging into?

00:25:01.532 --> 00:25:02.762
You should leave.

00:25:03.862 --> 00:25:05.262
Look me in the eye and tell me.

00:25:06.232 --> 00:25:07.432
What is it?

00:25:15.512 --> 00:25:16.772
A sex trade scandal.

00:25:19.512 --> 00:25:20.712
Sex trade?

00:25:22.652 --> 00:25:26.752
You mean Yoo Jeong met Kang Eun Seok through prostitution?

00:25:30.922 --> 00:25:33.562
So it's not just a simple case of prostitution. How big is this?

00:25:34.462 --> 00:25:35.692
If this gets out,

00:25:37.062 --> 00:25:38.532
it'll turn the entire country upside down.

00:25:39.402 --> 00:25:41.632
- What? - I can't tell you more. Not yet.

00:25:42.302 --> 00:25:43.372
It'll put you in danger too.

00:25:43.372 --> 00:25:45.942
I promise you'll be the first to know when the time comes.

00:25:46.602 --> 00:25:47.802
But not now.

00:26:04.392 --> 00:26:05.592
You're unbelievable.

00:26:06.962 --> 00:26:08.892
Why do you still have this?

00:26:13.132 --> 00:26:14.332
Are you crazy?

00:26:15.072 --> 00:26:17.832
I've regretted it ever since. The way we broke up.

00:26:19.202 --> 00:26:20.972
I never should have come here.

00:26:22.772 --> 00:26:24.942
This is wrong. We shouldn't see each other again.

00:26:27.112 --> 00:26:28.852
What more is there to say?

00:26:32.552 --> 00:26:33.752
I missed you.

00:26:59.212 --> 00:27:00.482
I must be crazy.

00:27:01.282 --> 00:27:02.612
I'm crazy.

00:27:03.582 --> 00:27:07.182
Seriously, Hyun Jin. You're losing it.

00:27:07.652 --> 00:27:09.052
(Shin Jae)

00:27:20.332 --> 00:27:22.932
- Hey. - Did you meet with Reporter Lee?

00:27:27.042 --> 00:27:28.512
A prostitution scandal?

00:27:28.912 --> 00:27:31.242
So that must be why Yoo Jeong wouldn't tell us where they met.

00:27:31.612 --> 00:27:33.042
She was afraid the prostitution part would come out.

00:27:34.812 --> 00:27:36.482
This is going to hurt our case.

00:27:37.052 --> 00:27:38.282
So what do we do now?

00:27:38.682 --> 00:27:42.722
Nothing's changed. Jo Yoo Jeong was clear that she never consented.

00:27:42.892 --> 00:27:46.492
Does meeting through prostitution mean it's okay to rape someone?

00:27:46.862 --> 00:27:50.462
Anyway, it seems like the scandal is huge.

00:27:50.632 --> 00:27:52.832
Even Jun Hyeok seemed overwhelmed by it.

00:27:53.662 --> 00:27:55.732
So you just backed off and left?

00:27:57.472 --> 00:27:58.972
Are you kidding? Of course not.

(Cheongdam New Pair SH 5pm)

00:28:03.742 --> 00:28:07.142
I think he has another source besides Yoo Jeong.

00:28:07.182 --> 00:28:10.482
If Yoo Jeong won't talk, we should try to approach them.

00:28:13.952 --> 00:28:15.152
By the way,

00:28:16.692 --> 00:28:18.362
nothing else happened, right?

00:28:19.592 --> 00:28:20.962
What do you mean?

00:28:22.592 --> 00:28:24.932
Never mind. Just asking.

00:28:25.532 --> 00:28:28.232
- Good work. Get some rest. - Hey, wait!

00:28:43.982 --> 00:28:46.182
- Why are you so late? - What?

00:28:50.522 --> 00:28:53.122
Don't you have the night shift today?

00:28:53.492 --> 00:28:56.132
I just stopped by. You know what tonight is.

00:28:56.992 --> 00:28:58.932
Hang on. I'll wash up and be right out.

00:29:09.512 --> 00:29:11.212
- Hey, Hyun Jin! - Yes?

00:29:11.372 --> 00:29:14.082
I left out your folic acid too. Go ahead and take it.

00:29:46.642 --> 00:29:51.012
- Stay strong, Kang Eun Seok! - Stay strong, Kang Eun Seok!

(We love you, Kang Eun Seok. Stay strong, Kang Eun Seok.)

00:29:52.582 --> 00:29:55.252
Mr. Kang, what verdict are you expecting?

00:29:55.322 --> 00:29:57.022
How are you feeling ahead of the verdict?

00:29:58.192 --> 00:30:01.762
I have faith that the truth will prevail.

00:30:02.932 --> 00:30:05.232
Depending on the verdict, what are your plans for the future?

00:30:05.302 --> 00:30:06.932
Do you have any last words for the court?

00:30:11.332 --> 00:30:13.772
Case number 2025 Gohap 308.

00:30:14.172 --> 00:30:17.472
For the defendant, Kang Eun Seok, we will now deliver the verdict.

00:30:20.742 --> 00:30:22.412
- Here he comes! - Here he comes!

00:30:22.482 --> 00:30:23.712
- Here he comes! - Here he comes!

00:30:23.782 --> 00:30:25.982
Mr. Kang Eun Seok was acquitted in the first trial.

00:30:26.022 --> 00:30:28.122
As the victim's attorney, do you accept this verdict?

00:30:28.222 --> 00:30:31.452
We hear his side plans a countersuit for false accusation and defamation.

00:30:31.522 --> 00:30:33.092

Yes, I've heard of it. In an article you wrote.

00:30:40.302 --> 00:30:43.372
But I'm sure you've also heard of "Trash Reporter," haven't you?

00:30:43.702 --> 00:30:45.142
I'm guessing you hear that one a lot.

00:30:47.642 --> 00:30:50.142
This isn't the Supreme Court. This was only the first trial.

00:30:50.372 --> 00:30:52.982
We'll see who's lying when we take this all the way.

00:30:55.042 --> 00:30:59.482
And when the truth comes out, there will be a price to pay.

00:31:30.882 --> 00:31:34.222

If they won't, we'll make them.

00:32:37.352 --> 00:32:38.482
The key to the appeal...

00:32:38.482 --> 00:32:41.182
is proving where Yoo Jeong and Kang Eun Seok met.

00:32:41.282 --> 00:32:44.452
If we can't prove that, there's no point in appealing.

why don't you ask him yourselves?

Why are you coming after me?

00:35:28.722 --> 00:35:30.522
That's it. I'm calling Reporter Lee to ask him what this is about.

- If you're really his friends. - That's enough.

He only goes after underage girls. That scumbag.

00:36:11.392 --> 00:36:13.232
Did it happen to you personally?

00:36:13.702 --> 00:36:15.502
If there's any way you could testify for the appeal...

Lady, I'm on probation, okay?

00:36:18.632 --> 00:36:21.842
You want me to admit I sold my body? Are you out of your mind?

00:36:22.412 --> 00:36:24.772
Besides, you'll never be able to nail Kang Eun Seok.

00:36:26.582 --> 00:36:27.782
You see this?

00:36:29.782 --> 00:36:32.852
You know how I ended up like this? It was all Kang Eun Seok.

00:36:33.322 --> 00:36:36.722
When I got busted for drugs, I ratted out everyone I knew.

00:36:36.752 --> 00:36:39.322
But only Kang Eun Seok's name vanished from my statement.

00:36:40.422 --> 00:36:41.622
I wonder why.

Who in the world is backing Kang Eun Seok?

00:36:46.532 --> 00:36:48.902
You know, don't you, Seon Hwa? That's why you met Reporter Lee.

00:36:51.532 --> 00:36:55.772
That girl, Kang Eun Seok's victim. Just leave her alone.

00:36:55.872 --> 00:36:58.072
She could get seriously hurt because of you.

00:37:23.672 --> 00:37:26.702
If Yoo Jeong is wronged like this, will you really be okay with that?

(29 Yeonbuk-ro 63-gil, Seoul. Semi-basement. Get it?)

00:41:20.002 --> 00:41:21.942
(Can she even show her face? Going to her house now.)

00:41:22.002 --> 00:41:23.242
(Darn, she's totally my type, though)

00:41:23.342 --> 00:41:24.612
(Beware of honey traps. Let's teach her a lesson.)

00:41:24.672 --> 00:41:25.672
(5 mins away. Coming, Yoo Jeong.)

00:41:25.672 --> 00:41:26.782
(Who were her lawyers? Trash them.)

00:41:26.842 --> 00:41:28.042
(Best Comment: Hope property values don't drop.)

00:41:28.142 --> 00:41:32.082
(You have a new notification)

00:41:36.922 --> 00:41:38.592
Yoo Min, don't come home today.

00:41:39.292 --> 00:41:41.822
Whatever you do, don't come home today.

00:41:46.002 --> 00:41:47.532
The "High School Honey Trap" is a big trend these days.

00:41:47.532 --> 00:41:48.532
Have you heard of it?

00:41:48.732 --> 00:41:50.202
Yes, I've heard of it.

00:41:50.872 --> 00:41:53.742
But I'm sure you've also heard of "Trash Reporter," haven't you?

00:41:54.642 --> 00:41:57.012
This isn't the Supreme Court. This was only the first trial.

00:41:57.542 --> 00:41:59.812
We'll see who's lying when we take this all the way.

00:42:01.112 --> 00:42:05.952
And when the truth comes out, there will be a price to pay.

00:42:07.482 --> 00:42:08.722
(Kang Eun Seok Acquitted of Sexual Assault)

00:42:56.402 --> 00:42:57.602
Come on in.

00:43:02.242 --> 00:43:03.472
Thanks for coming all this way.

00:43:04.012 --> 00:43:05.172
Can I get you something to drink first?

00:43:07.282 --> 00:43:08.482
No, I'm fine.

00:43:16.522 --> 00:43:17.722
Should we get started right away?

00:43:18.422 --> 00:43:20.692
One at a time? Or all at once?

00:43:48.482 --> 00:43:49.692
Where on earth have you been?

00:43:50.452 --> 00:43:51.652
What about your phone?

00:43:52.452 --> 00:43:55.222
My battery...

00:44:20.682 --> 00:44:22.282
Eat. Even if you don't have an appetite.

00:44:24.422 --> 00:44:26.862
I had the posts taken down. I'll keep monitoring it,

00:44:27.322 --> 00:44:30.162
and I'm suing every single person who's slandering you.

00:44:31.562 --> 00:44:32.802
I want to die.

00:44:35.002 --> 00:44:36.202
Why should you die?

00:44:36.832 --> 00:44:40.242
Kill, don't die. That's the mindset. To spite them all.

00:44:41.272 --> 00:44:44.442
If you're tied up, bite. If they gag you, headbutt them.

00:44:45.042 --> 00:44:47.782
Don't waste time on dying, figure out how to survive.

00:44:48.742 --> 00:44:50.682
That's what I would do.

00:45:05.162 --> 00:45:08.202
Did you meet Kang Eun Seok because he paid you for sex?

00:45:10.302 --> 00:45:14.072
I know you know this, but lying and being so reckless...

00:45:14.672 --> 00:45:16.012
was a terrible mistake.

00:45:19.312 --> 00:45:22.812
But the one who should be ashamed...

00:45:23.652 --> 00:45:25.382
is Kang Eun Seok, the man who paid to buy you.

00:45:25.912 --> 00:45:30.152
And the ones with more to answer for than you...

00:45:30.292 --> 00:45:32.252
are the adults who didn't teach you how dangerous and wrong that was.

00:45:34.862 --> 00:45:38.562
We are going to fight for you until the very end.

00:45:38.732 --> 00:45:39.932
But...

00:45:40.432 --> 00:45:41.962
you need to start helping us too.

00:45:43.002 --> 00:45:44.202
Do you understand what I mean?

00:45:49.742 --> 00:45:52.542
Okay, good. All right, then...

00:45:57.952 --> 00:45:59.152
First, let's get you something to eat.

00:46:19.132 --> 00:46:22.002
So, is Jo Yoo Jeong at your place right now?

00:46:22.702 --> 00:46:24.812
Yes. I waited until she was asleep before I left.

00:46:25.312 --> 00:46:28.282
When I'm done here, I'll ask where she met Kang Eun Seok.

00:46:28.742 --> 00:46:31.782
- Is she okay? - How could she be? She's only 18.

00:46:33.452 --> 00:46:34.952
The trial was closed to the public,

00:46:35.352 --> 00:46:37.822
and she never came to our office to avoid exposing her identity.

00:46:38.552 --> 00:46:41.362
So what kind of jerk leaked her identity?

00:46:48.232 --> 00:46:49.432
Swhat?

00:46:50.932 --> 00:46:53.402
Kang Eun Seok arrested on drug charges?

00:46:53.642 --> 00:46:56.672
Our tenth anniversary present. Do you like it?

00:46:58.412 --> 00:47:01.312
But I heard Lee Seon Hwa clammed up when the cops arrived.

00:47:01.412 --> 00:47:02.612
Yes, it seemed that way.

00:47:03.112 --> 00:47:04.852
Some big shot must have gotten to her.

00:47:05.412 --> 00:47:06.752
So?

00:47:07.022 --> 00:47:08.422
So, I went to see the Chief of Police.

00:47:10.452 --> 00:47:12.192
You definitely knocked him down a weight class.

00:47:12.492 --> 00:47:15.762
For the appeal, we fight a junkie, not the beloved son-in-law.

00:47:17.532 --> 00:47:20.832
You head to the hotel. I'm going to the police station.

00:47:20.862 --> 00:47:22.232
The police station? What for?

00:47:22.402 --> 00:47:25.932
I don't know. Maybe I should get Kang Eun Seok's autograph?

00:47:26.342 --> 00:47:27.702
I won't be able to once he's behind bars, right?

00:47:32.442 --> 00:47:34.242
You know, sometimes I think...

00:47:34.812 --> 00:47:39.652
I'm so darn glad she's our friend and not our enemy.

00:47:39.982 --> 00:47:41.622
I bet Shin Jae thought the same thing.

00:47:42.052 --> 00:47:44.752
About you, when you turned the tables on my stalker.

00:47:50.562 --> 00:47:51.762
Hang on.

00:47:53.632 --> 00:47:54.902
Hey, it's me.

00:47:55.862 --> 00:47:57.102
Are you free tonight?

00:47:57.972 --> 00:47:59.372
Look, about the other night...

00:48:00.242 --> 00:48:02.072
It was a mistake. A one-time thing.

00:48:02.572 --> 00:48:05.072
I'll give you the files. I've changed my mind.

00:48:05.912 --> 00:48:07.242
Be at my place by 8pm.

00:48:12.982 --> 00:48:14.282
You look better on screen.

00:48:15.652 --> 00:48:17.352
What a shame. I was so looking forward to this.

00:48:18.292 --> 00:48:19.922
You, on the other hand, are just my type, Attorney.

00:48:20.522 --> 00:48:21.892
You should've shown up in court sooner.

00:48:22.222 --> 00:48:23.892
It would've given me something to look forward to.

00:48:24.132 --> 00:48:26.732
Sorry. I'm not into long-distance.

00:48:27.502 --> 00:48:29.132
Prison is just a little too far from my place.

00:48:35.002 --> 00:48:36.572
The evidence I turned over to the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

00:48:38.542 --> 00:48:41.542
Security footage of you at an ATM in a Seocho-dong convenience store...

00:48:41.542 --> 00:48:42.812
depositing drug cash.

00:48:43.382 --> 00:48:45.882
Video of you at the fire hydrant across from the Maegun Hotel,

00:48:46.012 --> 00:48:48.622
picking up five bags of meth from a dead drop.

00:48:49.122 --> 00:48:52.022
Two grams of meth and some weed were found at your place earlier.

00:48:52.452 --> 00:48:56.532
And I'm sure you know what your hair follicle test will show.

00:48:58.792 --> 00:49:00.032
And?

00:49:01.102 --> 00:49:04.532
But there's one more thing I haven't turned over to the police.

00:49:07.972 --> 00:49:09.742
Turns out you were a dealer in the entertainment industry.

00:49:10.572 --> 00:49:12.712
You were quite generous with it too.

00:49:15.182 --> 00:49:19.182
You know the sentencing difference between use and distribution.

00:49:22.222 --> 00:49:24.592
So, what do you want in exchange?

00:49:31.392 --> 00:49:32.662
Who's backing you?

00:49:37.072 --> 00:49:38.272
Where did you meet Jo Yoo Jeong?

00:49:46.742 --> 00:49:48.412
Come on. You're obviously bluffing.

00:49:48.782 --> 00:49:50.612
I'm holding a straight flush.

00:49:50.952 --> 00:49:52.612
Who in their right mind folds that to take a garbage hand?

00:49:56.022 --> 00:49:57.222
Is that so?

00:49:58.792 --> 00:50:02.892
If people find out where you met Jo Yoo Jeong, your game falls apart.

00:50:05.462 --> 00:50:06.962
What are you saying? You're barking up the wrong tree.

00:50:08.302 --> 00:50:09.502
Thanks for confirming that for me.

00:50:10.232 --> 00:50:11.902
I wanted to hear it from you myself, Kang Eun Seok.

00:50:13.372 --> 00:50:16.512
So it wasn't just a rumor. A sex scandal to rock the nation.

00:50:16.572 --> 00:50:18.972
Are you really going to leak that? Right now?

00:50:19.712 --> 00:50:21.412
Actually, I already leaked it.

00:50:22.482 --> 00:50:24.552
I see things through to the end, even with a losing hand.

00:50:25.082 --> 00:50:26.252
And I've never lost.

00:50:41.762 --> 00:50:43.272
(LnJ 10th Anniversary Gala)

00:50:49.142 --> 00:50:52.172
- Business is going well, I trust? - Yes, it's going great, thank you.

00:50:59.382 --> 00:51:00.652
Welcome.

00:51:01.082 --> 00:51:03.292
- Please see our guests are seated. - Hello.

00:51:03.392 --> 00:51:04.622
- Hello. - It's been a while.

00:51:04.722 --> 00:51:07.692
- Good to see you. - You as well. I'll see you later.

00:51:10.862 --> 00:51:12.062
Counselor.

00:51:13.932 --> 00:51:15.162
I'll come say hi again later.

00:51:15.932 --> 00:51:17.132
Okay.

00:51:18.732 --> 00:51:19.942
Hello.

00:51:20.202 --> 00:51:22.002
It's been a while. You've been well, I hope.

00:51:27.582 --> 00:51:29.242
Did you hear? Choi Min Hye got a job.

00:51:30.082 --> 00:51:32.152
She said she'll stop by when she comes to Seoul next month.

00:51:32.852 --> 00:51:36.182
Guys, we got a letter from Seon Mi. She passed her GED!

00:51:37.392 --> 00:51:40.792
- Gosh, good for her. - Who sent the wine?

00:51:43.992 --> 00:51:45.392
It's a 2005 vintage.

00:51:48.502 --> 00:51:49.872
(Congratulations on your 10th anniversary.)

00:51:50.002 --> 00:51:53.302
- I bet it's from the alumni. - Right. It's from the school.

00:51:55.502 --> 00:51:56.872
Gosh, seriously...

00:51:58.872 --> 00:52:01.112
Ten years just flew by.

00:52:03.282 --> 00:52:06.212
But I don't think I could do this for another ten years.

00:52:06.482 --> 00:52:11.392
We have to play by my mom's rules to survive another ten years.

00:52:11.792 --> 00:52:15.662
Should we go to Jeju for our 20th? Just the 3 of us?

00:52:16.022 --> 00:52:18.292
Forget that. We should go to the Maldives.

00:52:20.732 --> 00:52:21.932
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Rock, paper, scissors.

00:52:23.172 --> 00:52:25.232
And the opening remarks go to Yoon Ra Young.

00:52:25.532 --> 00:52:28.972
- Seriously? - I got LASIK. I hate flashes.

00:52:29.912 --> 00:52:32.872
I'm heading back to the party. You two come down in a little bit.

00:52:39.752 --> 00:52:40.952
What are you doing?

00:52:41.652 --> 00:52:43.222
You're not trying to sneak out alone, are you?

00:52:44.022 --> 00:52:47.062
I'm going to get our present. Our tenth anniversary present.

00:52:48.622 --> 00:52:52.932
- A present? - Jun Hyeok's promised files.

00:52:53.502 --> 00:52:55.832
We can win the appeal.

00:52:57.232 --> 00:52:58.432
I'll call you.

00:52:58.702 --> 00:53:00.772
- What? - Hwang Hyun Jin.

00:53:00.842 --> 00:53:02.042
What?

00:53:03.442 --> 00:53:04.642
Don't do anything stupid.

00:53:05.712 --> 00:53:08.042
What's your problem? I said I'm just going for the files.

00:53:08.582 --> 00:53:10.812
And make sure the boss lady is happy.

00:53:10.912 --> 00:53:14.182
Knock them dead up there, all right? Goodness.

00:53:28.232 --> 00:53:29.432
(Congratulations on your 10th anniversary.)

00:53:40.512 --> 00:53:44.782
- Mom? - CEO Baek, come say hello.

00:53:45.182 --> 00:53:46.382
This is my daughter.

00:53:47.682 --> 00:53:51.422
You know who he is, right? The man making waves in IT.

00:53:52.052 --> 00:53:53.622
CEO Baek Tae Ju of The Prime.

00:53:54.662 --> 00:53:57.562
- It's a pleasure. I'm Baek Tae Ju. - I'm Kang Shin Jae.

00:53:58.492 --> 00:54:02.262
Why don't you introduce him around? Mingle a little.

00:54:04.832 --> 00:54:06.032
So you're single?

00:54:07.202 --> 00:54:09.742
Your mother said the same about you.

00:54:14.782 --> 00:54:16.582
As it happens, here's someone you should meet.

00:54:18.012 --> 00:54:20.382
- Thanks for coming. - Of course.

00:54:20.452 --> 00:54:21.752
Let me introduce you.

00:54:21.752 --> 00:54:23.022
This is CEO Baek Tae Ju of The Prime.

00:54:23.552 --> 00:54:25.352
And this is my ex-husband.

00:54:26.292 --> 00:54:27.492
I'm Han Seung Hun.

00:54:29.062 --> 00:54:30.292
Baek Tae Ju. A pleasure.

00:54:30.692 --> 00:54:31.932
I trust you've been well?

00:54:33.232 --> 00:54:34.462
I'll be right there. Go on ahead.

00:54:38.572 --> 00:54:40.202
And then there's...

00:54:41.802 --> 00:54:43.002
Look. There he is.

00:54:43.742 --> 00:54:47.112
Over there is my ex-ex-husband. The second son of the Hanje Group.

00:54:50.382 --> 00:54:51.582
Should I bring him over?

00:54:52.012 --> 00:54:53.952
I take it your ex-ex-ex-husband couldn't make it?

00:54:55.782 --> 00:54:57.952
Well, I've only managed to get divorced twice so far.

00:54:59.322 --> 00:55:02.662
Though I think my mother is hoping I'll go for a hat trick.

00:55:03.092 --> 00:55:04.292
Mr. Baek,

00:55:04.632 --> 00:55:07.532
I'd like you to meet someone. Shall we head over there?

00:55:07.702 --> 00:55:10.332
Of course. And congratulations on your tenth anniversary.

00:55:10.572 --> 00:55:11.772
I'll see you around, then.

00:55:12.632 --> 00:55:13.842
Right this way.

00:55:18.142 --> 00:55:21.742
I never imagined this would become a reunion for your ex-husbands.

00:55:23.042 --> 00:55:24.812
How could I not invite them on a day like today?

00:55:25.452 --> 00:55:27.652
They're the greatest contributors in LnJ's history.

00:55:28.582 --> 00:55:31.952
If it weren't for my first marriage, LnJ would never have existed.

00:55:32.422 --> 00:55:33.822
And if it weren't for my second,

00:55:34.392 --> 00:55:36.492
you would've cut me off financially ages ago, you know.

00:55:38.632 --> 00:55:39.832
I'm not going for a third one, Mom.

00:55:40.462 --> 00:55:41.832
So don't waste your breath.

00:56:25.872 --> 00:56:27.942
Jun Hyeok, I'm here.

00:56:30.652 --> 00:56:31.852
I'm coming in.

00:56:32.982 --> 00:56:34.182
Darn it.

00:56:48.332 --> 00:56:49.532
Lee Jun Hyeok.

00:57:02.642 --> 00:57:06.982
First, I'd like to thank you all for the last ten years.

00:57:07.252 --> 00:57:09.222
Without the help of all of you here today,

00:57:09.582 --> 00:57:13.192
we never would have survived these ten years.

00:57:14.062 --> 00:57:17.832
Most of all, I'd like to thank someone for their constant support.

00:57:18.232 --> 00:57:21.332
CEO Seong Tae Im of Haeil, let's give her a round of applause.

00:57:24.932 --> 00:57:26.132
Thank you.

00:57:59.932 --> 00:58:01.772
If we couldn't land a kick, we'd throw a punch.

00:58:02.342 --> 00:58:03.612
If a hook didn't connect, we'd use a jab.

00:58:04.042 --> 00:58:06.542
And when even a jab wouldn't work, what choice did we have?

00:58:07.412 --> 00:58:09.982
We spent the last ten years fighting tooth and nail.

00:58:10.812 --> 00:58:15.422
But now, after ten years of that, we can land a hook, and even a kick.

00:58:15.852 --> 00:58:17.392
That's the kind of world we live in now.

00:58:17.992 --> 00:58:21.562
If we've played even a small part in making the world a better place,

00:58:22.122 --> 00:58:25.062
then for the next decade, and the one after that,

00:58:25.692 --> 00:58:28.002
we will gladly continue the fight.

00:58:28.762 --> 00:58:30.572
On the side of the weak and the just.

00:58:52.252 --> 00:58:54.292
Shall we all raise a glass?

00:59:03.732 --> 00:59:07.172
- To LnJ! - To LnJ!

00:59:49.042 --> 00:59:53.052
(Honour)

01:00:30.022 --> 01:00:33.022
I killed someone.

01:00:33.592 --> 01:00:34.792
Jun Hyeok.

01:00:35.322 --> 01:00:36.562
Lee Jun Hyeok!

01:00:36.862 --> 01:00:39.692
Are you saying you're a suspect in a sexual assault case?

01:00:40.432 --> 01:00:41.802
You brought evidence here? Are you out of your mind?

01:00:42.232 --> 01:00:45.472
That ship has sailed. Now figure out how to stay afloat.

01:00:45.702 --> 01:00:47.642
It was stuck in the mattress. We only found one.

01:00:47.702 --> 01:00:51.072
- It was me! I killed him! - Jo Yoo Jeong.

01:00:52.072 --> 01:00:54.142
- Stay away! - Why you're doing this...

01:00:54.412 --> 01:00:55.812
I will find out no matter what.
