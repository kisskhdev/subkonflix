WEBVTT

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.242
Hey.

00:01:04.242 --> 00:01:06.453
What on earth did you do to me?

00:01:06.453 --> 00:01:08.705
What did I do? Don't be dramatic.

00:01:08.705 --> 00:01:11.563
This is my room. And my bed.

00:01:14.751 --> 00:01:16.962
This blanket is mine too.

00:01:37.692 --> 00:01:39.402
Hold on,

00:01:39.402 --> 00:01:41.279
what's my baby doing out here?

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:42.489
Wait,

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:45.513
we only opened one bottle, right?

00:01:52.726 --> 00:01:54.375
Sun Tae Hyung.

00:01:54.375 --> 00:01:58.338
There's one more I kept hidden.

00:01:58.338 --> 00:02:00.340
Now, it's my turn.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.549
Let's roll, baby.

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.510
Pull yourself together, Tae Hyung.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.719
This lighting is gorgeous.

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.179
That's my sister's, though...

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:09.305
Pour me a drink.

00:02:09.305 --> 00:02:11.933
I'm having this much.

00:02:20.858 --> 00:02:24.489
Keep it down or the baby wakes up.

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.991
Hold on, I'll snap one for you.

00:02:26.991 --> 00:02:28.952
- Am I doing it right?
- No.

00:02:28.952 --> 00:02:30.537
What an idiot, seriously.

00:02:30.537 --> 00:02:31.996
Wrong way. It's flipped around.

00:02:31.996 --> 00:02:33.039
Hold it this way instead.

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.832
The heck is this?

00:02:33.832 --> 00:02:36.042
Steady it like this and shoot.

00:02:36.042 --> 00:02:37.962
Click.

00:02:39.254 --> 00:02:41.840
Keep your hands off my baby.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.384
Want me to show you my award?

00:02:44.384 --> 00:02:47.095
As soon as I got into this field,

00:02:47.095 --> 00:02:47.971
everyone called me brilliant.

00:02:47.971 --> 00:02:50.744
Genius. Pure brilliance.

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:56.563
[Grand Prize]
That's impressive.

00:02:56.563 --> 00:02:59.482
Check out this masterpiece.

00:02:59.482 --> 00:03:02.652
Hold on, those words came out of me?

00:03:02.652 --> 00:03:06.030
You got totally drunk
and lost it completely, huh?

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.347
All of this chaos began with...

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:12.662
I want to see my sister.

00:03:12.662 --> 00:03:13.872
It's okay, stop crying.

00:03:13.872 --> 00:03:16.480
Don't touch me.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:19.878
You've got to be kidding.

00:03:19.878 --> 00:03:21.087
Did I seriously cry?

00:03:21.087 --> 00:03:21.796
I can't believe this.

00:03:21.796 --> 00:03:25.155
Why was I comforting you?

00:03:31.681 --> 00:03:33.789
I'm burning up.

00:03:40.148 --> 00:03:42.089
It's freezing.

00:03:46.154 --> 00:03:48.387
- No!
- No!

00:03:51.788 --> 00:03:53.912
[Episode 4]

00:03:53.912 --> 00:03:55.371
We should stop drinking for now.

00:03:55.371 --> 00:03:56.414
Actually,

00:03:56.414 --> 00:03:58.166
let's cut it out for good.

00:03:58.166 --> 00:04:00.043
This is terrible for Woo Joo.

00:04:00.043 --> 00:04:02.337
Why did you break out that cheap wine?

00:04:02.337 --> 00:04:03.630
Wine hits me way too hard.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.299
Who broke out fancy glasses for the mood?

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.342
You got all hyped and flipped on the lights.

00:04:09.342 --> 00:04:10.845
You were complaining about the rain,

00:04:10.845 --> 00:04:12.639
so I tried to cheer you up.

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.140
Then who said they actually like rain

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.434
and then cried like a baby?

00:04:16.434 --> 00:04:19.437
It always gets strange with you.

00:04:19.437 --> 00:04:21.606
I had zero desire to enter that room.

00:04:21.606 --> 00:04:23.942
That sounds really off.

00:04:23.942 --> 00:04:26.633
You walked into my room

00:04:27.902 --> 00:04:29.489
and stole my bed.

00:04:29.489 --> 00:04:31.532
Choose your words carefully.

00:04:31.532 --> 00:04:34.535
We just got wasted and fell asleep.

00:04:34.535 --> 00:04:36.518
Hey.

00:04:43.042 --> 00:04:45.046
The more we talk about it,

00:04:45.046 --> 00:04:47.507
the worse it gets.

00:04:47.507 --> 00:04:48.466
Starting today,

00:04:48.466 --> 00:04:50.551
there is

00:04:50.551 --> 00:04:52.136
no more alcohol. Period.

00:04:52.136 --> 00:04:53.388
Particularly

00:04:53.388 --> 00:04:56.079
when it rains. Not happening.

00:04:59.976 --> 00:05:02.077
Wrap this up by wiping the table.

00:06:03.164 --> 00:06:04.167
Excuse me?

00:06:04.167 --> 00:06:06.316
You actually slept with your in-law?

00:06:08.463 --> 00:06:11.716
Se Yeon, lower your voice.

00:06:11.716 --> 00:06:14.177
I said roommates, not bed partners!

00:06:14.177 --> 00:06:15.762
Have you lost your mind?

00:06:15.762 --> 00:06:18.681
We literally just slept. Nothing else.

00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:20.641
How many episodes did I miss here?

00:06:20.641 --> 00:06:22.143
That's moving at lightning speed.

00:06:22.143 --> 00:06:25.646
Living together and already into him?

00:06:25.646 --> 00:06:27.023
Right.

00:06:27.023 --> 00:06:28.775
The Pimang guy is kind of charming.

00:06:28.775 --> 00:06:30.151
Are you out of your mind?

00:06:30.151 --> 00:06:31.903
It was

00:06:31.903 --> 00:06:33.321
one hundred percent the drinks.

00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:35.698
No, the boiler is the real culprit.

00:06:35.698 --> 00:06:38.868
The first hot bath in ages wiped me out.

00:06:38.868 --> 00:06:40.370
And the alcohol went straight to my head.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.872
Was cohabiting with a guy a bad call?

00:06:42.872 --> 00:06:45.249
Since when are you so casual about hooking up?

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:46.376
Are you serious right now?

00:06:46.376 --> 00:06:48.984
Nothing like that happened!

00:06:53.424 --> 00:06:55.510
Hyun Jin,

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.185
that has to feel awkward now.

00:06:58.185 --> 00:06:58.930
Why would it be?

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.642
One drunk night flips everything.

00:07:02.642 --> 00:07:06.646
So now do you see the in-law as a man?

00:07:06.646 --> 00:07:08.940
Absolutely not!

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.734
That's the most absurd thing ever.

00:07:11.734 --> 00:07:13.945
Honestly?

00:07:13.945 --> 00:07:16.364
Go, go, he's wide open!

00:07:16.364 --> 00:07:17.073
Okay.

00:07:17.073 --> 00:07:18.324
There we go, there we go!

00:07:18.324 --> 00:07:19.450
Take the high side.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:20.451
- I've got the low end.
- Okay.

00:07:20.451 --> 00:07:21.452
Send it over.

00:07:21.452 --> 00:07:23.287
- Just touch it... Shoot!
- He's right below!

00:07:23.287 --> 00:07:24.288
Take the shot!

00:07:24.288 --> 00:07:25.623
Dude, just pull the trigger!

00:07:25.623 --> 00:07:28.000
How many times, man? Get it together.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.317
Your head's not in the game today.

00:07:31.168 --> 00:07:32.255
What about Woo Joo?

00:07:32.255 --> 00:07:34.340
Her aunt has him since it's the weekend.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.717
All organized, huh?

00:07:36.717 --> 00:07:38.636
Roommate life suits you?

00:07:38.636 --> 00:07:40.179
Pretty much, yeah.

00:07:40.179 --> 00:07:41.929
Give us the details on that setup.

00:07:41.929 --> 00:07:43.641
There's something I've been curious about.

00:07:43.641 --> 00:07:44.473
Like what?

00:07:44.473 --> 00:07:48.060
You guys live together.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.646
After a shower, are you fully dressed?

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.775
You expect me to walk out bare?

00:07:52.775 --> 00:07:56.510
You two share shampoo and smell alike?

00:07:58.153 --> 00:07:59.699
You probably have the same scent.

00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:00.908
That's the dumbest thing I've...

00:08:00.908 --> 00:08:02.452
Coming here was a mistake. I'm out.

00:08:02.452 --> 00:08:03.453
Right?

00:08:03.453 --> 00:08:05.538
For real, it doesn't bother you at all?

00:08:05.538 --> 00:08:08.332
I mean, she's a woman and you're a man.

00:08:08.332 --> 00:08:10.168
Living that close,
feelings come out of nowhere...

00:08:10.168 --> 00:08:12.670
We're not that close, cut it out.

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:17.114
She's so swamped I hardly see her.

00:08:18.342 --> 00:08:19.969
I'm leaving.

00:08:19.969 --> 00:08:20.636
Hey.

00:08:20.636 --> 00:08:22.763
What is it now?

00:08:22.763 --> 00:08:24.683
Is she good-looking?

00:08:27.224 --> 00:08:28.269
What?

00:08:28.269 --> 00:08:31.122
Is your in-law good-looking?

00:08:40.321 --> 00:08:42.365
Is she good-looking?

00:08:43.117 --> 00:08:45.037
No.

00:08:45.701 --> 00:08:47.912
Hi, Woo Joo.

00:08:52.919 --> 00:08:55.546
- You go fir--
- Go ahead.

00:08:55.546 --> 00:08:56.839
All right, I'll head in first.

00:08:56.839 --> 00:08:58.759
Sure.

00:09:21.904 --> 00:09:23.115
Hyun Jin, what's your problem?

00:09:23.115 --> 00:09:24.492
Why does he make you nervous?

00:09:24.492 --> 00:09:26.953
Are you out of your mind?

00:09:26.953 --> 00:09:28.977
I think I'm going crazy.

00:09:56.899 --> 00:10:00.675
You two share shampoo and smell alike?

00:10:02.697 --> 00:10:05.013
Excuse me.

00:10:06.323 --> 00:10:07.325
What?

00:10:07.325 --> 00:10:08.953
Well...

00:10:08.953 --> 00:10:10.371
Mind if I step in real quick?

00:10:10.371 --> 00:10:12.665
Are you crazy? I'm in the shower

00:10:12.665 --> 00:10:14.208
with nothing on right now.

00:10:14.208 --> 00:10:16.210
My bad. So sorry.

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:18.693
She must have lost her mind.

00:10:24.484 --> 00:10:25.760
Come on, Tae Hyung.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.247
What's wrong with you? Why so aware?

00:10:27.247 --> 00:10:27.972
What are you, twelve?

00:10:27.972 --> 00:10:29.432
It's not like you've never been with someone.

00:10:29.432 --> 00:10:32.184
Making a big deal out of nothing...

00:10:32.184 --> 00:10:33.728
Are you almost done?

00:10:33.728 --> 00:10:35.563
What's taking so long?

00:10:35.563 --> 00:10:37.671
All finished, heading out now.

00:10:38.274 --> 00:10:40.590
Why does she keep rushing me...

00:11:05.968 --> 00:11:07.909
Man, it's sweltering in here.

00:11:13.309 --> 00:11:15.333
This window is stuck.

00:11:17.102 --> 00:11:20.149
You press it like this

00:11:20.149 --> 00:11:22.257
and then push.

00:11:34.163 --> 00:11:38.189
Is your in-law good-looking?

00:11:47.426 --> 00:11:49.618
Is she good-looking?

00:11:52.723 --> 00:11:54.748
Is she good-looking?

00:12:12.616 --> 00:12:14.284
Hey.

00:12:14.284 --> 00:12:15.246
Hey.

00:12:15.246 --> 00:12:17.166
Yeah?

00:12:21.752 --> 00:12:24.213
The landlord still won't answer?

00:12:24.213 --> 00:12:27.158
This door needs to be repaired too.

00:12:30.175 --> 00:12:32.638
This one's broken too?

00:12:32.638 --> 00:12:34.558
Step outside for a sec.

00:12:45.776 --> 00:12:47.759
Do you see him as a man?

00:12:49.111 --> 00:12:51.197
Do you see him as a man?

00:13:01.582 --> 00:13:03.709
Do you see him as a man?

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:15.639
Hey.

00:13:15.639 --> 00:13:17.559
Hey.

00:13:19.798 --> 00:13:22.605
Water costs a fortune these days.

00:13:22.605 --> 00:13:24.815
Let me give the landlord a ring.

00:13:24.815 --> 00:13:27.628
Isn't that right, Woo Joo?

00:13:36.535 --> 00:13:39.330
Since you just started
you wouldn't have a clue,

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:43.167
but GloMarket holds
a seriously sore spot for our manager.

00:13:43.167 --> 00:13:45.544
Among every single project he's done,

00:13:45.544 --> 00:13:47.546
it's the one and only flop on his record.

00:13:47.546 --> 00:13:50.633
He even flew out to the U.S. headquarters
to meet with the CEO.

00:13:50.633 --> 00:13:51.801
Right at the last round,

00:13:51.801 --> 00:13:53.803
they turned him away
claiming Asian products couldn't hold

00:13:53.803 --> 00:13:55.638
their own in the market.

00:13:55.638 --> 00:13:56.514
In your case,

00:13:56.514 --> 00:13:58.015
when your contract runs out,
you just walk away,

00:13:58.015 --> 00:14:00.184
so I suppose the stakes
don't feel the same to you.

00:14:00.184 --> 00:14:02.061
Those of us on permanent staff

00:14:02.061 --> 00:14:05.231
are the ones left picking up the pieces.

00:14:05.231 --> 00:14:06.774
Moving on,

00:14:06.774 --> 00:14:09.631
you're seriously not the lobby girl, right?

00:14:10.736 --> 00:14:13.072
If you say you're not, I'll believe you, but...

00:14:13.072 --> 00:14:14.782
How does that add up though?

00:14:14.782 --> 00:14:17.034
Seriously, what kind of person
drags their husband

00:14:17.034 --> 00:14:18.619
and baby into the workplace?

00:14:18.619 --> 00:14:20.725
That's absolutely insane.

00:14:22.496 --> 00:14:25.626
Well, maybe she had

00:14:25.626 --> 00:14:27.378
something really urgent going on?

00:14:27.378 --> 00:14:30.653
People all have their own situations...

00:14:32.304 --> 00:14:34.218
Everybody does.

00:14:34.218 --> 00:14:35.719
They obviously have zero sense of boundaries.

00:14:35.719 --> 00:14:38.679
That dad in particular.

00:14:38.679 --> 00:14:40.931
Right?

00:14:40.931 --> 00:14:42.393
So let's be careful

00:14:42.393 --> 00:14:44.520
that we never get in the way

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.189
of our manager's project, got it?

00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:49.233
Absolutely.

00:14:49.233 --> 00:14:51.360
Forget a husband,

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.571
I can't even find a boyfriend.

00:14:53.571 --> 00:14:55.614
Good.

00:14:55.614 --> 00:14:57.867
Let's move to the meeting room.

00:14:57.867 --> 00:15:00.517
- Sure.
- Okay.

00:15:05.956 --> 00:15:10.335
[BS Food]

00:15:10.335 --> 00:15:11.338
Thrilling, isn't it?

00:15:11.338 --> 00:15:14.466
There's nothing like reclaiming
what slipped through our fingers.

00:15:14.466 --> 00:15:17.469
Let's seize the GloMarket.

00:15:17.469 --> 00:15:19.805
I need a full rundown of rival products
already on GloMarket,

00:15:19.805 --> 00:15:21.640
along with a game plan for taking them on.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.267
The existing proposal needs
a complete overhaul too.

00:15:23.267 --> 00:15:25.394
Also, Hyun Jin.

00:15:25.394 --> 00:15:28.022
I'd like to see your work on organizing
the overseas distribution data.

00:15:28.022 --> 00:15:29.356
I actually prepared something

00:15:29.356 --> 00:15:31.150
just in case it came in handy.

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:31.942
[GloMarket Platform Strategy]
On top of that,

00:15:31.942 --> 00:15:34.028
I've put together a report
on the latest shifts in consumer trends

00:15:34.028 --> 00:15:37.220
and a GloMarket sales analysis.

00:15:43.746 --> 00:15:44.955
Head over to my desk so we can

00:15:44.955 --> 00:15:47.103
jump right into this, Hyun Jin.

00:16:06.352 --> 00:16:07.895
Using this as a foundation,

00:16:07.895 --> 00:16:11.231
how about you try putting together
the first draft of the proposal?

00:16:11.231 --> 00:16:12.368
What?

00:16:12.368 --> 00:16:13.484
Me?

00:16:13.484 --> 00:16:16.570
I'm curious to see your approach
to the localization concepts as well.

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:18.499
Is that overwhelming?

00:16:20.532 --> 00:16:23.474
No, I can do it.

00:16:25.704 --> 00:16:27.122
Goal!

00:16:27.122 --> 00:16:29.272
Here, you try too.

00:16:32.252 --> 00:16:34.588
Excuse me, mister.

00:16:34.588 --> 00:16:36.256
Mister in unit 207.

00:16:36.256 --> 00:16:38.300
Yeah, what do you want?

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.803
You have no clue

00:16:40.803 --> 00:16:43.681
how freaked out I've been because of you.

00:16:43.681 --> 00:16:46.080
Oh, darn it.

00:16:46.684 --> 00:16:49.061
Oh, gosh.

00:16:49.061 --> 00:16:51.230
If my in-law finds out, she's going to lose it.

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:53.150
Hey, mister...

00:16:53.857 --> 00:16:56.527
Why are you blaming me for that?

00:16:56.527 --> 00:17:00.114
The boiler was busted from the start.

00:17:00.114 --> 00:17:01.073
You scared me!

00:17:01.073 --> 00:17:03.492
Didn't I warn you to stop
tossing your cigarette butts

00:17:03.492 --> 00:17:04.493
in the bottle?

00:17:04.493 --> 00:17:06.120
Those are from ages ago.

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.789
I quit smoking already.

00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:10.958
What? You can't even believe your own son?

00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:12.084
Hello.

00:17:12.084 --> 00:17:13.585
- How are you doing?
- Oh, I'm great.

00:17:13.585 --> 00:17:15.462
I have a report to make.

00:17:15.462 --> 00:17:18.090
Yesterday at roughly 5:32 p.m.,

00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:19.967
I spotted this gentleman right here

00:17:19.967 --> 00:17:23.326
puffing on a cigarette
outside the corner store.

00:17:25.305 --> 00:17:28.706
You're in big trouble when we get home.

00:17:29.893 --> 00:17:31.812
Don't you know the bro code?

00:17:31.812 --> 00:17:33.188
Bro code? Between us?

00:17:33.188 --> 00:17:34.815
You cost me a million won.

00:17:34.815 --> 00:17:36.025
Wait, a million won?

00:17:36.025 --> 00:17:37.317
What are you talking about, a million won?

00:17:37.317 --> 00:17:39.445
The boiler in this unit costs a million...

00:17:39.445 --> 00:17:40.320
Oh dear, what a nightmare!

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.363
A million won gone just like that

00:17:41.363 --> 00:17:43.115
and the landlord doesn't
even answer my calls...

00:17:43.115 --> 00:17:45.617
Come to think of it, that landlord seems

00:17:45.617 --> 00:17:47.661
like either the busiest person alive

00:17:47.661 --> 00:17:50.164
or someone who flat-out ignores calls.

00:17:50.164 --> 00:17:51.248
He'll answer sooner or later.

00:17:51.248 --> 00:17:52.624
Just tell the landlord to cover it. Easy fix.

00:17:52.624 --> 00:17:54.710
- Oh, that would work.
- Right.

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:57.588
Hey, where's your other half?

00:17:57.588 --> 00:17:58.756
Huh?

00:17:58.756 --> 00:18:00.758
Your other half is right over there.

00:18:00.758 --> 00:18:02.384
Sir, keep your mouth shut.

00:18:02.384 --> 00:18:03.719
Right.

00:18:03.719 --> 00:18:05.471
Oh, you made it, sweetie?

00:18:05.471 --> 00:18:07.181
Hello.

00:18:07.181 --> 00:18:08.849
Sweetie?

00:18:08.849 --> 00:18:10.809
What?

00:18:10.809 --> 00:18:13.062
He says the two of you

00:18:13.062 --> 00:18:14.855
are super lovey-dovey.

00:18:14.855 --> 00:18:16.106
That's what you said, wasn't it?

00:18:16.106 --> 00:18:17.941
Mind your own business.

00:18:17.941 --> 00:18:21.403
Anyway, did you two eat yet?

00:18:21.403 --> 00:18:23.489
I just have to throw on a couple more plates,

00:18:23.489 --> 00:18:25.866
so come join us if you're hungry.

00:18:25.866 --> 00:18:26.867
And, well,

00:18:26.867 --> 00:18:29.912
if there's anything you need help with,
just say the word.

00:18:29.912 --> 00:18:31.205
Sure.

00:18:31.205 --> 00:18:32.081
- Got it.
- Bye.

00:18:32.081 --> 00:18:33.248
Thank you. We'll head home now.

00:18:33.248 --> 00:18:34.666
Sure, get home safe.

00:18:34.666 --> 00:18:36.585
Ask the landlord for compensation.

00:18:36.585 --> 00:18:37.586
Sleep tight, little one.

00:18:37.586 --> 00:18:38.879
That's how you grow up big and strong.

00:18:38.879 --> 00:18:39.838
Lovey-dovey.

00:18:39.838 --> 00:18:41.758
Mister, please.

00:18:42.424 --> 00:18:44.218
How does something like that even happen?

00:18:44.218 --> 00:18:45.219
Woo Joo's parents

00:18:45.219 --> 00:18:48.202
were genuinely wonderful people.

00:18:49.264 --> 00:18:52.707
The world can be so unfair.

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:57.981
Death doesn't pick and choose

00:18:57.981 --> 00:18:59.922
between the good and the bad.

00:19:00.982 --> 00:19:03.277
You know that too.

00:19:08.075 --> 00:19:09.743
Hey.

00:19:09.743 --> 00:19:13.539
Did you go around saying
something strange about us?

00:19:13.539 --> 00:19:16.397
What's all that lovey-dovey talk
out of nowhere?

00:19:17.042 --> 00:19:18.085
What?

00:19:18.085 --> 00:19:23.029
I think he said that
just because you look so adorable.

00:19:30.097 --> 00:19:32.015
Yes, manager.

00:19:32.015 --> 00:19:34.476
Oh, right.

00:19:34.476 --> 00:19:35.561
I'll pull it all together

00:19:35.561 --> 00:19:37.312
and have it over to you in 20 minutes.

00:19:37.312 --> 00:19:38.772
Don't forget to attach
the lead time calculation

00:19:38.772 --> 00:19:40.691
with the initial proposal.

00:19:40.691 --> 00:19:43.193
Yes, that file you shared with me earlier...

00:19:43.193 --> 00:19:45.088
I should have it somewhere.

00:19:50.407 --> 00:19:51.410
Are you outside?

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:52.536
Then let's talk later...

00:19:52.536 --> 00:19:54.621
No, I'm definitely at home.

00:19:55.495 --> 00:19:57.968
Was that a cat?

00:19:57.968 --> 00:20:00.023
Oh, be careful.

00:20:01.003 --> 00:20:03.088
The TV volume is way up, isn't it?

00:20:03.088 --> 00:20:07.259
I have trouble focusing
unless there's white noise on.

00:20:07.259 --> 00:20:10.262
Anyway, I'll have it all sorted
and sent your way.

00:20:10.262 --> 00:20:12.306
All right.

00:20:12.306 --> 00:20:14.766
If anything trips you up, reach out.

00:20:14.766 --> 00:20:17.583
Sure thing, manager.

00:20:22.149 --> 00:20:24.276
What's making you so jumpy?

00:20:24.276 --> 00:20:25.777
Is your manager that intimidating?

00:20:25.777 --> 00:20:27.697
It's not that.

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:30.616
I have to show what I'm capable of.

00:20:30.616 --> 00:20:32.618
He put his faith in me
and handed me this opportunity,

00:20:32.618 --> 00:20:34.620
so I need to pour everything I have into this

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.914
and deliver real results.

00:20:36.914 --> 00:20:38.980
Prove yourself to who...

00:20:41.501 --> 00:20:43.128
Well...

00:20:43.128 --> 00:20:46.632
No shortage of people I need to impress.

00:20:46.632 --> 00:20:47.799
And beyond that,

00:20:47.799 --> 00:20:50.636
I'm the sole contract employee on this team,

00:20:50.636 --> 00:20:51.553
so even if I work myself to death,

00:20:51.553 --> 00:20:55.263
I don't know if I can survive.

00:20:55.263 --> 00:20:56.767
So,

00:20:56.767 --> 00:20:59.519
for a while,

00:20:59.519 --> 00:21:01.939
I'm going to be stuck
at the office late every night,

00:21:01.939 --> 00:21:04.111
so, if it's not too much to ask...

00:21:07.194 --> 00:21:10.113
just until this project wraps up,

00:21:10.113 --> 00:21:13.388
would you mind looking after Woo Joo for me?

00:21:17.285 --> 00:21:19.289
Okay.

00:21:19.289 --> 00:21:20.249
Honestly, it's fine.

00:21:20.249 --> 00:21:24.233
The two of us could benefit from
a little breathing room right now anyway.

00:21:26.255 --> 00:21:28.487
You get some rest too.

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:06.506
Were you up all night?

00:22:16.452 --> 00:22:19.394
Have you been feeding yourself at all?

00:22:36.906 --> 00:22:40.703
Your auntie's working so hard to make it...

00:22:47.941 --> 00:22:51.801
She was actually kind of cute back then.

[Pull your own weight, Hyun Jin!]

00:23:23.953 --> 00:23:25.729
You know what?

00:23:25.729 --> 00:23:29.505
I usually love rainy days.

00:23:49.062 --> 00:23:52.191
What are you pulling that off for?

00:23:56.736 --> 00:23:59.104
Have you ever experienced life
in a basement apartment?

00:23:59.104 --> 00:24:02.538
Do you know what street life is like?

00:24:03.432 --> 00:24:06.310
Do you have a clue about the story

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:08.854
behind those glow-in-the-dark stars?

00:24:08.854 --> 00:24:10.708
When my sister and I were kids,

00:24:10.708 --> 00:24:14.318
we lived in this basement unit

00:24:14.318 --> 00:24:17.799
that flooded whenever it rained.

00:24:17.799 --> 00:24:20.116
So each rainy season,

00:24:20.116 --> 00:24:22.701
mold would spread all over the place,

00:24:22.701 --> 00:24:25.746
and no matter how hard we scrubbed,
it never went away.

00:24:25.746 --> 00:24:28.541
And you know what her solution was?

00:24:28.541 --> 00:24:30.167
My sister

00:24:30.167 --> 00:24:33.212
turned finding the mold into a little game

00:24:33.212 --> 00:24:37.591
and covered each spot
with glow-in-the-dark stars.

00:24:37.591 --> 00:24:39.718
It was

00:24:39.718 --> 00:24:42.680
so magical back then.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.872
That explains why you always avoided

00:24:46.475 --> 00:24:48.395
this room.

00:24:50.438 --> 00:24:52.629
Because it reminds you of her.

00:24:54.859 --> 00:24:58.635
I wondered why you slept in the living room
when you had a good room.

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:08.372
Whenever it rained,

00:25:08.372 --> 00:25:11.375
my sister would show up for me.

00:25:11.375 --> 00:25:13.358
And

00:25:14.253 --> 00:25:17.173
every time I broke down

00:25:17.173 --> 00:25:19.383
because I missed Mom,

00:25:20.468 --> 00:25:25.222
my sister would whip up some pancakes.

00:25:25.222 --> 00:25:29.040
She'd throw in corn and cheese
and all sorts of stuff.

00:25:32.396 --> 00:25:34.273
At that time, my sister was just

00:25:34.273 --> 00:25:36.817
fifteen years old.

00:25:39.737 --> 00:25:41.886
She sounds like a wonderful sister.

00:25:43.699 --> 00:25:46.307
But the very last words

00:25:47.077 --> 00:25:49.686
I ever spoke to that incredible person were

00:25:51.624 --> 00:25:55.169
"I don't want to be your sister anymore."

00:25:55.169 --> 00:25:57.213
In this exact room.

00:25:57.963 --> 00:26:00.613
What a horrible thing for me to say.

00:26:02.635 --> 00:26:05.179
And now

00:26:05.179 --> 00:26:09.141
I don't even have anyone to shelter me anymore,

00:26:11.644 --> 00:26:15.378
and I'm never going to taste
my sister's cooking again...

00:26:27.868 --> 00:26:30.329
I want to see her so badly...

00:26:46.762 --> 00:26:48.847
Have your meal with Bunny.

00:26:48.847 --> 00:26:51.308
There you go, don't stop eating.

00:26:51.308 --> 00:26:53.228
Wipe your hands.

00:26:57.731 --> 00:26:59.923
Oh no, it burned.

00:27:01.277 --> 00:27:03.343
It's raining a lot out there...

00:27:06.884 --> 00:27:07.908
Hey, little one.

00:27:07.908 --> 00:27:08.534
Yeah?

00:27:08.534 --> 00:27:09.743
Do you miss your auntie?

00:27:09.743 --> 00:27:11.328
With all this rain,
you just can't stop worrying, right?

00:27:11.328 --> 00:27:12.955
How about we try calling her?

00:27:12.955 --> 00:27:14.875
Yeah.

00:27:15.749 --> 00:27:19.336
You're the one who wanted to, okay?

00:27:21.171 --> 00:27:23.424
Yeah.

00:27:23.424 --> 00:27:25.801
I just got out of a meeting.

00:27:25.801 --> 00:27:27.886
Did you have dinner yet?

00:27:27.886 --> 00:27:28.846
There's this spot right by my work

00:27:28.846 --> 00:27:30.514
that does incredible kimchi fried rice.

00:27:30.514 --> 00:27:31.682
I'll grab some on my way back.

00:27:31.682 --> 00:27:33.642
The deluxe version with ham.

00:27:33.642 --> 00:27:35.603
I should make it home by eight or so.

00:27:35.603 --> 00:27:38.624
We'll just have something at home.

00:27:38.624 --> 00:27:40.357
Forget about that and just get here quick.

00:27:40.357 --> 00:27:42.151
So you would make it by eight?

00:27:42.151 --> 00:27:43.694
Hyun Jin.

00:27:43.694 --> 00:27:45.654
Did you go over the competitor pricing?

00:27:45.654 --> 00:27:47.573
Your figures didn't add up.

00:27:47.573 --> 00:27:48.407
Yes.

00:27:48.407 --> 00:27:51.160
I'll correct it and get it to you immediately.

00:27:53.078 --> 00:27:55.414
I'll call you back.

00:27:55.414 --> 00:27:57.334
Seriously...

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:00.942
I put so much effort
into these kimchi pancakes...

00:28:09.197 --> 00:28:13.034
Sorry. It looks like
I'll be delayed a bit longer.

00:28:13.034 --> 00:28:15.579
What time will you get here?

00:28:15.579 --> 00:28:17.520
Delayed a bit longer?

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:22.128
You're still at the office?

00:28:24.837 --> 00:28:26.631
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

00:28:26.631 --> 00:28:28.030
I need to get going.

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:29.198
Have a safe trip home.

00:28:29.198 --> 00:28:31.325
Have a good one.

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:36.290
Let's call it a day.

00:28:36.914 --> 00:28:38.874
Sure.

00:28:38.874 --> 00:28:40.751
It's raining, so I'll give you a ride.

00:28:40.751 --> 00:28:43.379
No, thank you. I'm fine.

00:28:43.379 --> 00:28:46.841
Do you and your sister still share a place?

00:28:47.633 --> 00:28:50.844
No, I live alone.

00:28:50.844 --> 00:28:53.555
There are some personal circumstances...

00:28:53.555 --> 00:28:56.225
We're heading to the same spot
as last time, correct?

00:28:56.225 --> 00:28:58.310
Seriously, you don't have to do this.

00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:01.897
The strategy in your proposal was off.

00:29:01.897 --> 00:29:03.857
I'll go over it with you on the way

00:29:03.857 --> 00:29:05.860
to be more efficient.

00:29:13.719 --> 00:29:15.744
This is just basic human decency.

00:29:15.744 --> 00:29:17.454
It's humanity, compassion,

00:29:17.454 --> 00:29:19.748
or more formally, "benevolence."

00:29:19.748 --> 00:29:21.458
You'll get it when you're older.

00:29:21.458 --> 00:29:22.584
Watch and learn from me.

00:29:22.584 --> 00:29:24.169
What about me?

00:29:24.169 --> 00:29:25.671
Look, this is for your sake.

00:29:25.671 --> 00:29:28.966
If your aunt gets sick,
you're the one who'll catch it.

00:29:28.966 --> 00:29:30.676
Your immune system is still weak.

00:29:30.676 --> 00:29:33.095
If you get sick, I'm the one

00:29:33.095 --> 00:29:33.762
who'll struggle.

00:29:33.762 --> 00:29:36.056
- Yes.
- Right.

00:29:36.056 --> 00:29:37.975
It seems like we're on the same page today.

00:29:37.975 --> 00:29:42.085
Since it's coming down out there,

00:29:43.188 --> 00:29:45.755
you need to...

00:29:46.794 --> 00:29:48.402
What brings you by?

00:29:48.402 --> 00:29:50.612
Oh, hello there, Woo Joo.

00:29:50.612 --> 00:29:51.613
Oh my.

00:29:51.613 --> 00:29:53.657
The baby's aunt left

00:29:53.657 --> 00:29:55.576
without an umbrella,

00:29:55.576 --> 00:29:58.620
so I'm going to bring it to her
out of a sense of humanity.

00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:00.622
No one is stopping you.

00:30:00.622 --> 00:30:02.332
I'll keep an eye on the baby,

00:30:02.332 --> 00:30:03.250
so you go on.

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:04.585
Come on, play with me.

00:30:04.585 --> 00:30:06.211
- I appreciate it.
- Just get going already.

00:30:06.211 --> 00:30:09.423
He usually stays calm
when he has this stuffed animal.

00:30:09.423 --> 00:30:10.966
Gosh.

00:30:10.966 --> 00:30:12.593
This is quite charming.

00:30:12.593 --> 00:30:13.761
What's the plan?

00:30:13.761 --> 00:30:16.764
Are you leaving the baby to go pick her up?

00:30:16.764 --> 00:30:17.848
Mom.

00:30:17.848 --> 00:30:18.974
I got it.

00:30:18.974 --> 00:30:20.976
That hurts.

00:30:33.717 --> 00:30:35.532
[Do you have an umbrella with you?]

00:30:35.532 --> 00:30:37.910
When on earth is she coming?

00:30:42.915 --> 00:30:46.190
It's always a stroke of misfortune
when it rains.

00:30:55.052 --> 00:30:57.869
Oh, that's a nice car.

00:31:01.183 --> 00:31:03.894
Why is he so tall?

00:31:17.407 --> 00:31:19.493
I'm grateful for your help every time.

00:31:19.493 --> 00:31:20.536
You should head in.

00:31:20.536 --> 00:31:23.872
No, you go ahead first, Senior.

00:31:23.872 --> 00:31:27.584
Actually, I should say Manager...

00:31:27.584 --> 00:31:30.003
I need to use your title,

00:31:30.003 --> 00:31:32.069
but it's hard to break the habit.

00:31:52.693 --> 00:31:54.987
You'll end up sick again.

00:31:54.987 --> 00:31:56.907
Get home quickly.

00:32:23.557 --> 00:32:25.309
I worried for nothing.

00:32:25.309 --> 00:32:27.394
She should've mentioned the car ride.

00:32:27.394 --> 00:32:29.062
It's frustrating.

00:32:29.062 --> 00:32:29.771
That was a nice car.

00:32:29.771 --> 00:32:31.691
Hey.

00:32:46.872 --> 00:32:50.667
How long have you been waiting there?

00:32:50.667 --> 00:32:53.921
I honestly didn't expect you
to greet me outside.

00:32:53.921 --> 00:32:56.173
You claimed you had no one
to shield you from the rain,

00:32:56.173 --> 00:32:57.090
but you have many.

00:32:57.090 --> 00:32:58.717
You're even being driven home.

00:32:58.717 --> 00:33:00.969
The Manager suggested giving me a lift

00:33:00.969 --> 00:33:02.137
since the downpour was so heavy.

00:33:02.137 --> 00:33:04.640
Why did he give you a ride?

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.058
Plus, why did you choose
to get off at that spot?

00:33:06.058 --> 00:33:07.100
You don't even have an umbrella,

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:09.978
so you should've had him pull up to the door.

00:33:12.541 --> 00:33:14.191
It's a slightly complicated situation...

00:33:14.191 --> 00:33:16.652
I have zero interest
in hearing your explanation.

00:33:16.652 --> 00:33:18.572
None.

00:33:38.966 --> 00:33:41.218
Please stop making empty promises.

00:33:41.218 --> 00:33:45.139
Waiting is my biggest pet peeve.

00:33:57.693 --> 00:33:59.736
He even added corn.

00:33:59.736 --> 00:34:01.822
Managing the layout was the biggest challenge

00:34:01.822 --> 00:34:03.031
for this task.

00:34:03.031 --> 00:34:06.189
It was a straightforward approach for Han Lina.

[Han Lina's Second Prime

Apparently, this photoshoot led
to a series of acting contracts.

00:34:15.043 --> 00:34:17.462
Amy Choo never fails to impress.

00:34:17.462 --> 00:34:19.131
The most insane part is

00:34:19.131 --> 00:34:21.758
that Amy Choo actually mentioned your roommate.

00:34:21.758 --> 00:34:25.637
You credited an assistant
for the very first time in this spread.

00:34:25.637 --> 00:34:26.866
You mean Sun Tae Hyung?

00:34:26.866 --> 00:34:29.619

Amy Choo is a household name.

Bring your preferred gear and show up tomorrow.

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.680
What?

00:35:55.204 --> 00:35:56.520
You should head there tomorrow.

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.563
I'm not going.
I already gave up on taking pictures.

00:35:58.563 --> 00:36:00.774
You were an award winner in school

00:36:00.774 --> 00:36:03.443
and made a name for yourself.

00:36:06.029 --> 00:36:08.615
People considered you a natural talent.

00:36:08.615 --> 00:36:09.991
How much longer will you shadow me?

00:36:09.991 --> 00:36:11.910
You should go there.

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:14.663
Although I'm currently on leave,

00:36:14.663 --> 00:36:15.914
I have a job to return to,

00:36:15.914 --> 00:36:17.415
and I no longer own a camera.

00:36:17.415 --> 00:36:19.918
You do have a camera.

00:36:19.918 --> 00:36:22.462
The one you got as a birthday gift.

00:36:24.066 --> 00:36:25.382
The one you couldn't throw away

00:36:25.382 --> 00:36:26.591
because it was precious,

00:36:26.591 --> 00:36:28.760
so you picked it back up.

00:36:31.555 --> 00:36:33.807
I've tried

00:36:33.807 --> 00:36:37.249
to get rid of this, but I'm unable to.

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:41.504
This isn't like me at all.

00:36:43.669 --> 00:36:47.802
Maybe it's because it was
my first and last birthday gift...

00:36:51.366 --> 00:36:53.952
Who was the sender?

00:36:54.786 --> 00:36:56.706
Someone.

00:36:58.748 --> 00:37:00.856
I just

00:37:02.002 --> 00:37:04.568
took photos of people and scenery

00:37:05.547 --> 00:37:08.425
while waiting

00:37:08.425 --> 00:37:11.178
for someone.

00:37:13.763 --> 00:37:17.331
I just took pictures whenever I missed them.

00:37:18.643 --> 00:37:21.021
I happen

00:37:21.021 --> 00:37:23.671
to be quite talented at it.

00:37:27.986 --> 00:37:31.303
I try to quit, but I keep shooting,

00:37:36.286 --> 00:37:39.353
and that only intensifies my longing.

00:37:40.916 --> 00:37:43.607
That's what this is.

00:37:44.711 --> 00:37:48.632
I really admired
that you had such a strong passion.

00:37:48.632 --> 00:37:51.051
You seemed

00:37:51.051 --> 00:37:54.179
quite impressive for once.

00:37:56.514 --> 00:37:59.434
If you need closure

00:37:59.434 --> 00:38:01.937
to understand why you can't let go,

00:38:01.937 --> 00:38:03.688
then go verify your feelings.

00:38:03.688 --> 00:38:05.941
Figure out if you're unable

00:38:05.941 --> 00:38:08.048
or unwilling to move on.

00:38:11.196 --> 00:38:12.197
And

00:38:12.197 --> 00:38:13.865
I'm willing to assist you

00:38:13.865 --> 00:38:16.243
in any way possible.

- With anything.

It's a favor for the great pancakes

00:38:21.915 --> 00:38:23.856
you prepared yesterday.

00:38:29.881 --> 00:38:31.675
You should discover

00:38:31.675 --> 00:38:33.802
if it's attachment

00:38:33.802 --> 00:38:36.202
or genuine passion.

can you leave work on time today?

00:38:56.825 --> 00:38:58.368
Hey.

00:38:58.368 --> 00:38:59.911
You've finally made a decision.

00:38:59.911 --> 00:39:01.496
I'm happy for you already.

00:39:01.496 --> 00:39:03.540
I'll make sure to leave on time today

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:05.250
and be there by seven.

00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:07.127

It's a film camera.

And it's an automatic?

00:44:40.522 --> 00:44:42.566
You've got quite the nerve.

00:44:42.566 --> 00:44:44.568
I got rid of all my gear three years ago,

00:44:44.568 --> 00:44:46.926

I still really enjoy working with film,

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:55.454
so I'm glad you brought one.

00:44:55.454 --> 00:44:58.457
It won't be a complex test.

I understand, but...

00:47:31.234 --> 00:47:33.028
That's such a weak excuse, isn't it?

00:47:33.028 --> 00:47:35.238
You're right, but wait.

00:47:35.238 --> 00:47:37.157
Why don't we sit for a moment?

00:47:37.157 --> 00:47:40.410
It's a weak excuse, but...

00:47:40.410 --> 00:47:41.912
It already looks good,

00:47:41.912 --> 00:47:46.498
but can we move this slightly to the right?

00:47:46.498 --> 00:47:48.710
That's a bit much.

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:51.630
Who actually goes to the trouble
of balancing everything in a presentation?

00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:53.256
I see your point,

00:47:53.256 --> 00:47:55.634
but a chart might work better.

00:48:23.787 --> 00:48:26.020
The scholarship wasn't my motivation.

00:48:28.583 --> 00:48:30.691
I stayed up for you.

00:48:33.797 --> 00:48:36.363
I simply wanted to be by your side all night.

00:49:09.497 --> 00:49:11.669
Woo Joo, how are you doing?

00:49:21.094 --> 00:49:23.014
Hey, Woo Joo.

00:49:32.606 --> 00:49:33.607
Help,

00:49:33.607 --> 00:49:36.109
the child has been injured.

00:49:36.109 --> 00:49:37.402
He had a fall

00:49:37.402 --> 00:49:40.822
and there's a lot of blood right here.

00:49:40.822 --> 00:49:42.741
This wound requires stitches.

00:49:42.741 --> 00:49:45.160
He'll need a local anesthetic.

00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:48.018
Are you the guardian?

00:49:49.122 --> 00:49:51.541
You must be accompanied by a guardian.

00:49:51.541 --> 00:49:53.585
Doctor.

00:49:53.585 --> 00:49:55.505
Just a second.

00:50:05.178 --> 00:50:08.105
[Temporary helper]

00:50:16.358 --> 00:50:18.318
Why isn't she picking up?

00:50:18.318 --> 00:50:21.277
Your call is being forwarded to voicemail...

00:50:21.277 --> 00:50:23.071
Please. The honor's mine.

00:50:23.071 --> 00:50:24.989
I have high expectations for your company.

00:50:24.989 --> 00:50:25.865
Thanks.

00:50:25.865 --> 00:50:27.241
We hope to see you again soon.

00:50:27.241 --> 00:50:27.992
Thank you.

00:50:27.992 --> 00:50:30.127
- Take care.
- Take care.

00:50:40.338 --> 00:50:41.967
[Missed call]

00:50:41.967 --> 00:50:43.887
Oh, he called.

00:50:46.214 --> 00:50:47.263
Where are you right now?

00:50:47.263 --> 00:50:48.515
Why haven't you been picking up?

00:50:48.515 --> 00:50:51.351
Well, work suddenly came up...

00:50:51.351 --> 00:50:52.769
Forget that,

00:50:52.769 --> 00:50:54.771
the baby is in the hospital.

00:50:54.771 --> 00:50:57.480
The hospital?

00:50:57.480 --> 00:50:58.525
What's wrong?

00:50:58.525 --> 00:50:59.359
What happened?

00:50:59.359 --> 00:51:01.820
I need to head somewhere else urgently.

00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:03.071
Where is the location?

00:51:03.071 --> 00:51:05.137
I'll drive you there.

00:51:10.328 --> 00:51:11.997
I'm Sun Woo Joo's guardian.

00:51:11.997 --> 00:51:13.289
Where is he?

00:51:13.289 --> 00:51:15.209
Please wait a second.

00:51:51.453 --> 00:51:53.373
Tae Hyung.

00:51:54.205 --> 00:51:56.583
I'm so sorry.

00:51:56.583 --> 00:51:58.293
I feel terrible about the interview,

00:51:58.293 --> 00:52:00.901
and for making you wait
so long at the hospital too.

00:52:07.302 --> 00:52:09.137
By the way,

00:52:09.137 --> 00:52:11.829
how exactly did he get injured?

00:52:13.016 --> 00:52:15.332
Why haven't I been able to get a hold of you?

00:52:19.355 --> 00:52:21.441
I'm sorry.

00:52:21.441 --> 00:52:23.799
Things have been so hectic for me...

00:52:29.866 --> 00:52:32.992
I was lost

00:52:32.992 --> 00:52:35.330
because they wouldn't perform the procedure
without a guardian,

00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:37.999
and you weren't picking up.

00:52:37.999 --> 00:52:40.482
I was going to lose my mind the whole time.

00:52:45.799 --> 00:52:47.759
I told you I hate waiting.

00:52:47.759 --> 00:52:49.010
How many times has this happened already?

00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:50.637
You should just...

00:52:50.637 --> 00:52:53.765
not make promises you can't keep.

00:52:53.765 --> 00:52:55.058
Tae Hyung.

00:52:55.058 --> 00:52:56.726
I really am trying my best
to take responsibility...

00:52:56.726 --> 00:52:58.561
For whom?

00:52:58.561 --> 00:52:59.729
Who is taking responsibility for whom?

00:52:59.729 --> 00:53:01.481
You can't even handle your own life,

00:53:01.481 --> 00:53:04.548
much less a baby.

00:53:11.116 --> 00:53:12.826
You are no different.

00:53:12.826 --> 00:53:14.869
If you said you would look after him,
you should have done a better job.

00:53:14.869 --> 00:53:17.622
Didn't I make it clear?

00:53:17.622 --> 00:53:20.773
I'm not the kind of person
who should be in charge of anyone.

00:53:21.543 --> 00:53:23.753
Snap out of it.

00:53:23.753 --> 00:53:26.005
I'm not the parent,

00:53:26.005 --> 00:53:27.841
you are.

00:53:27.841 --> 00:53:29.865
You're the one

00:53:31.136 --> 00:53:34.620
who stepped up to take him in, not me.

00:53:37.934 --> 00:53:40.501
Is Sun Woo Joo's guardian here?

00:53:47.485 --> 00:53:50.405
Luckily, it's just a minor cut.

00:53:50.405 --> 00:53:54.784
Please return in five days
to get the stitches out.

00:53:54.784 --> 00:53:56.077
That said,

00:53:56.077 --> 00:53:57.996
has he been

00:53:57.996 --> 00:54:00.832
struggling with sleep?

00:54:00.832 --> 00:54:02.375
Is he waking up at odd hours

00:54:02.375 --> 00:54:05.003
or acting up during the day?

00:54:05.003 --> 00:54:08.047
I haven't tracked it recently,

00:54:08.047 --> 00:54:09.257
but he's usually a deep sleeper...

00:54:09.257 --> 00:54:10.633
Actually,

00:54:10.633 --> 00:54:13.636
he's been waking up
every fifteen minutes lately.

00:54:13.636 --> 00:54:14.971
If he's left alone,

00:54:14.971 --> 00:54:18.224
he wakes up crying in less than ten minutes.

00:54:18.224 --> 00:54:21.811
It's likely an emotional response to stress.

00:54:21.811 --> 00:54:23.438
That major incident from before

00:54:23.438 --> 00:54:26.983
is probably the trigger.

00:54:26.983 --> 00:54:29.777
Right now, his mental state

00:54:29.777 --> 00:54:32.739
is more concerning than the cut.

00:54:32.739 --> 00:54:34.616
Even at his age,

00:54:34.616 --> 00:54:37.076
children sense everything.

00:54:37.076 --> 00:54:41.436
You need to take extra care of him.

00:54:53.259 --> 00:54:54.928
Thank goodness.

00:54:54.928 --> 00:54:57.035
The fever has gone down.

00:55:02.769 --> 00:55:05.438
Woo Joo.

00:55:05.438 --> 00:55:07.629
Forgive me.

00:55:08.274 --> 00:55:12.050
For not being there with you yesterday.

00:55:13.446 --> 00:55:15.949
I love you.

00:55:15.949 --> 00:55:18.015
Me too.

00:55:21.246 --> 00:55:23.437
Wait a minute.

00:55:35.176 --> 00:55:37.826
Is his temperature back to normal?

00:55:40.265 --> 00:55:42.016
Yeah.

00:55:42.016 --> 00:55:44.833
Then, well, it's fine.

00:56:01.452 --> 00:56:03.372
Woo Joo.

00:56:07.417 --> 00:56:10.795
Your uncle must have been really scared.

00:56:10.795 --> 00:56:12.715
Right?

00:56:21.554 --> 00:56:22.890
Who is taking responsibility for whom?

00:56:22.890 --> 00:56:24.809
You can't even handle your own life,

00:56:24.809 --> 00:56:28.126
much less a baby.

00:56:29.647 --> 00:56:32.608
Why did I have to say that?

00:56:32.608 --> 00:56:34.633
Darn it.

00:56:35.903 --> 00:56:38.679
Why was I so dramatic?

00:56:44.869 --> 00:56:45.621
Hello.

00:56:45.621 --> 00:56:47.729
Hello. Welcome.

00:56:52.045 --> 00:56:54.797
It's for a 20-month-old kid,

00:56:54.797 --> 00:56:56.090
so he can eat abalone porridge, right?

00:56:56.090 --> 00:56:57.008
Sure.

00:56:57.008 --> 00:56:59.093
I'll take the premium one.

00:56:59.093 --> 00:57:00.470
Alright.

00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:02.555
And,

00:57:02.555 --> 00:57:04.182
something for an adult to eat,

00:57:04.182 --> 00:57:06.373
please recommend something.

00:57:16.110 --> 00:57:19.011
I look like a mess.

00:57:52.563 --> 00:57:54.483
You're here?

00:57:56.401 --> 00:58:00.154
I'm going to eat ramen.

00:58:00.154 --> 00:58:02.429
Do you want to eat together?

00:58:04.534 --> 00:58:07.161
I picked up some porridge,

00:58:07.161 --> 00:58:09.747
let's share this.

00:58:09.747 --> 00:58:11.667
Okay.

00:58:17.255 --> 00:58:19.175
Who is it?

00:58:22.535 --> 00:58:24.011
What?

00:58:24.011 --> 00:58:26.305
What is the manager doing here...

00:58:26.305 --> 00:58:28.349
Hello, I'm the landlord of unit 206.

00:58:28.349 --> 00:58:29.809
Landlord?

00:58:29.809 --> 00:58:31.686
He's the landlord?

00:58:31.686 --> 00:58:34.315
- Of this house?
- Yes.

00:59:20.822 --> 00:59:23.822
Senior, you're the landlord here, right?

00:59:23.822 --> 00:59:25.197
Senior?

00:59:25.197 --> 00:59:27.655
Can you believe I actually
crossed paths with her first love?

00:59:27.655 --> 00:59:29.946
Can someone tell me what has got him so angry?

00:59:29.946 --> 00:59:31.330
Do you want to go camping tomorrow?

00:59:31.330 --> 00:59:33.030
- Say "ah."
- I said I don't want any.

00:59:33.030 --> 00:59:33.787
- Tae Hyung.
- Excuse me.

00:59:33.787 --> 00:59:34.747
It's awkward, I know.

00:59:34.747 --> 00:59:36.322
But we're practically strangers,
so of course it is.

00:59:36.322 --> 00:59:38.697
Shall we try to get close like before?

00:59:38.697 --> 00:59:39.863
- Your wife?
- Excuse me?

00:59:39.863 --> 00:59:41.128
No, she isn't.

00:59:41.128 --> 00:59:42.863
However, the camera lens never lies.

00:59:42.863 --> 00:59:44.381
The way you are gazing at her,

00:59:44.381 --> 00:59:46.238
and the emotions you felt
while taking that picture,

00:59:46.238 --> 00:59:48.977
that kind of shot is impossible without love.
