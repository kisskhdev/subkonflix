WEBVTT

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.760
I never even slept in a woodshed at the Fan house.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.040
We're away from home now.

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:46.519
It's not like being at home.

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:48.359
Come on, just make do.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.560
Then where are you sleeping?

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.000
I'll sleep with you.

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:54.680
I'm sleeping with Xiu Gu.

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:56.560
Are you coming or not?

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.680
Young Master.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.280
The Young Mistress is still waiting for you at home.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.239
I know.

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:06.480
I'm warning you now.

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.120
Regarding Yu Zhen...

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:10.400
Don't you go running your mouth.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.359
About this matter,

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.400
I'll explain it to her face to face.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.039
If you dare gossip all over the place,

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:18.879
I'll rip your mouth open.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.599
Everyone thinks you suffered so much out here.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.360
But you're actually living quite the carefree life.

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:29.719
You only see the thief eating meat,

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:32.319
not the thief getting beaten.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.520
Go to sleep.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.599
It's rare for me to travel so far,

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.560
and you make me sleep in a woodshed.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.680
Little baby.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.280
Want to see something different?

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.960
Little baby.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.479
How do you know who I am?

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.479
You're a friend of Boss Fan, right?

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.879
Who doesn't know that?

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:20.319
Let's go, little baby.

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:22.159
Today, let's go drink a different kind of wine.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.879
Are you very expensive?

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.960
I'm afraid I didn't bring enough money.

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:29.400
Talking about money is so vulgar.

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:32.039
Let's go, let's go.

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:07.000
I'm not bragging,

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.159
but our Young Master Fan,

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.479
he only listens to me.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.280
As long as I

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.360
give him

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.280
a few instructions,

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.360
you can open a branch for free.

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:22.800
Baby,

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:24.959
then I'll have to repay you properly.

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:29.839
Let's try something a little different.

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:30.920
What... what kind of different?

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.879
You're so amazing,

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.879
surely you have many heroic deeds.

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.199
How about you tell me one,

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:38.439
and if I find it fascinating,

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:41.120
I'll take off one piece of clothing.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.639
Deal, deal, deal!

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.800
These stories are like a monk's wooden fish...

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:49.319
plenty, plenty, plenty!

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.560
Then hurry up and tell me.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.519
The first one...

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:55.199
When our Young Master was in Weiyuan Town,

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.879
he was buried alive for colluding with bandits.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.040
It was me

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.680
who risked my life to save him.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.879
Does that count?

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.040
It counts.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.160
Baby, you're so amazing!

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.360
I knew it!

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.720
You have the strong scent of a hero on you.

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:13.800
Off, off, off!

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.519
Hey, that's not right.

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:24.360
How come there's another layer underneath?

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:26.839
Let's keep going.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.240
I... I'll strip you down to nothing.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.560
The second story...

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:35.279
Our Young Master

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:38.120
loves Sichuan Opera.

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:40.519
In Weiyuan Town,

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:43.279
he apprenticed under the famous actor

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.720
Wen Yan.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.199
Every time he snuck out,

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.319
I was the one covering for him.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.279
It's been dozens of pots already.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.279
Not a single one is up to standard.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.399
You...

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:03.560
how can you be so thick-headed?

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:05.800
Dozens of ingredients, all different amounts.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.120
It'd be a miracle if I could remember them.

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:09.240
Forget it, I can't deal with you.

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:10.360
How about this.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.800
I've written the secret recipe

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.480
in this notebook.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.879
You can memorize it.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.360
Memorize?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.959
You scolded me,

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:19.439
and I still have to memorize the recipe?

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.759
I must be a glutton for punishment.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.399
I said memorize it, so memorize it!

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:23.240
I won't!

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.639
Do it!

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:25.879
I said I won't!

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.240
Come back and memorize the recipe!

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:29.920
Go away!

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.560
Xiu Gu, come out and memorize!

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:53.120
Memorize the recipe!

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.439
How did you know Gan Xia'er had a problem?

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:07.680
Every time I teach you to fry the base,

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.759
he finds some excuse to run in.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.360
I asked the apprentices,

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.199
whenever we fry the base,

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.680
he finds an excuse to go to the latrine.

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:18.480
It can't be that much of a coincidence.

00:07:19.519 --> 00:07:21.240
Then let's go catch him now.

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:23.519
Come back.

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:25.720
This Gan Xia'er

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.120
is from a poor family too.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.199
When he became an apprentice,

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.480
he just wanted to learn a trade.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.639
Let him memorize it.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.279
This...

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.959
I copied it from the "Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon".

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.160
It won't kill anyone,

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.000
and it nourishes yin and strengthens yang.

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:47.879
You always think of everyone else,

00:07:48.519 --> 00:07:49.680
but never consider me.

00:07:56.879 --> 00:07:58.240
When I see Yu Zhen,

00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:01.120
I'll tell her about us.

00:08:01.319 --> 00:08:02.560
Don't be in such a rush.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.079
Yu Zhen is very nice,

00:08:05.319 --> 00:08:06.959
she has a soft heart.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:09.920
Really?

00:08:10.079 --> 00:08:10.639
Really.

00:08:19.079 --> 00:08:19.839
Boss Fan,

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.800
come, please come inside.

00:08:23.199 --> 00:08:23.639
Come.

00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:30.360
Boss Fan, please.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:30.680
Good.

00:08:42.519 --> 00:08:43.799
What are you looking at? Just sit here.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.080
Sit down.

00:08:54.799 --> 00:08:56.279
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.360
Thanks, thanks, thanks.

00:08:59.759 --> 00:09:00.960
Thanks, thanks, thanks.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.360
Sorry to trouble everyone.

00:09:02.559 --> 00:09:04.519
I, Qin, propose a toast to everyone.

00:09:04.519 --> 00:09:07.159
May you all get promoted and get rich.

00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:10.759
Wishing Commander Qin a very happy birthday.

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:11.440
Cheers.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.399
Cheers.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.600
Please sit, please sit.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.799
Let the feast begin.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.360
Commander Qin! Commander Qin!

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.559
My apologies, my apologies.

00:09:21.799 --> 00:09:23.600
I, Huo, have arrived late.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.159
I went to prepare a big gift for Commander Qin.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.519
That is very thoughtful of you, Young Master Huo.

00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:30.600
Knowing Commander Qin is a seasoned opera fan...

00:09:30.759 --> 00:09:33.440
...I personally went to Weiyuan...

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:35.879
...and invited famous performers to liven things up.

00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:37.759
I wonder if Commander Qin...

00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:39.720
...will like it.

00:09:40.039 --> 00:09:43.200
When the drums beat, gold pours in.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.159
Start the show!

00:10:22.759 --> 00:10:30.240
Standing at the bow, viewing the beautiful scenery.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:40.320
Thousands of purples and reds fill the land.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.399
Gently rocking the boat as it moves slowly.

00:10:48.799 --> 00:10:59.960
Letting the flowing water carry the boat along.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.720
Bravo! Bravo!

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.799
Someone else is celebrating a big birthday...

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.080
...what does it have to do with you?

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.679
Why are you sulking here?

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.879
Did you see clearly?

00:11:21.799 --> 00:11:22.720
On this invitation...

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.440
...my name really isn't written.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.480
They only invited Boss Fan.

00:11:27.919 --> 00:11:29.679
Even a steamer has upper and lower tiers.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.240
I am the real boss.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.559
I am the General Manager of Dongshihui.

00:11:33.879 --> 00:11:35.799
What's the point of joining this bustle?

00:11:36.759 --> 00:11:38.320
It's all shiny horse dung.

00:11:38.679 --> 00:11:40.960
Friendly on the surface, but full of schemes inside.

00:11:42.039 --> 00:11:43.759
Even if they invited me, I wouldn't go.

00:11:43.919 --> 00:11:44.679
Invite you?

00:11:45.399 --> 00:11:46.559
Who are you?

00:11:46.919 --> 00:11:49.039
I think you've eaten too many corn cakes...

00:11:49.639 --> 00:11:50.519
...and are talking nonsense.

00:11:51.559 --> 00:11:53.360
You're like a peacock fanning its tail—flattering yourself.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.960
That's enough, you two.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:00.840
I just feel that...

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.399
...this meal of his...

00:12:02.559 --> 00:12:03.799
...won't be so easy to eat.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:06.799
You guys keep eating.

00:12:07.039 --> 00:12:08.000
I'll go take a look.

00:12:13.519 --> 00:12:15.480
And he said he didn't want to go.

00:12:27.039 --> 00:12:29.200
Quick, find something fast.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.720
To get Master Wen out of here.

00:12:32.039 --> 00:12:32.720
Hurry.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:37.759
Today,

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:40.480
is the joyous occasion of Commander Qin's birthday.

00:12:40.679 --> 00:12:43.759
Wen Yan, please join Commander Qin

00:12:43.879 --> 00:12:44.799
for a couple of drinks.

00:12:46.799 --> 00:12:50.120
Wishing Commander Qin fortune as the East Sea and longevity as the South Mountain.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.480
Thank you, Wen Yan.

00:12:51.879 --> 00:12:54.240
Look how soft and delicate Wen Yan's hands are.

00:12:54.679 --> 00:12:56.159
You sang beautifully just now.

00:12:56.519 --> 00:12:58.399
I will reward you handsomely later.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.039
Wen Yan is truly Weiyuan's famous star.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.000
I heard Boss Fan is also from Weiyuan.

00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:07.720
I wonder if you two

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.159
know each other?

00:13:11.039 --> 00:13:11.559
Don't know him.

00:13:12.639 --> 00:13:13.360
Don't know her.

00:13:15.159 --> 00:13:16.360
I also heard

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.000
there was a young master in Weiyuan

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.039
who colluded with bandits,

00:13:19.639 --> 00:13:21.399
stole his own family's grain,

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.960
and was buried alive.

00:13:23.559 --> 00:13:25.919
Boss Fan, what a coincidence.

00:13:25.919 --> 00:13:27.399
Your surname is also Fan.

00:13:29.679 --> 00:13:31.240
Young Master Huo, you're rambling.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.080
Why are you going so far off topic?

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.080
Don't neglect

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.360
our Wen Yan who came from afar.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:37.480
How about this,

00:13:38.879 --> 00:13:42.759
I, Qin, will toast Wen Yan first.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.399
Why are you making such a fuss?

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.320
Just the two of you drinking,

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.360
is so lonely.

00:13:51.559 --> 00:13:53.039
Why don't we all

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.200
toast Wen Yan together?

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:56.399
That works too.

00:13:56.399 --> 00:13:58.519
Come, let's all toast Wen Yan.

00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:01.279
Cheers.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.960
Then please, Wen Yan, take a seat.

00:14:08.919 --> 00:14:10.840
What's all the commotion now?

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.879
Today is Commander Qin's big day.

00:14:15.399 --> 00:14:17.759
I also want to put on a show

00:14:17.759 --> 00:14:20.000
to celebrate Commander Qin's birthday.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.080
Come, come, Wen Yan.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.159
Sit here with me. Sit here.

00:14:24.159 --> 00:14:24.720
Come.

00:14:25.679 --> 00:14:27.159
Commander Qin, don't rush.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.720
Find a chance to leave in a moment.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.600
Someone will pick you up.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.559
Commander Qin,

00:14:34.159 --> 00:14:36.759
I'm going on stage now.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.960
Let's go.

00:15:01.279 --> 00:15:03.639
Coming up, Boss Fan presents.

00:15:03.919 --> 00:15:04.759
Boss Fan.

00:15:04.759 --> 00:15:08.159
Beggars are immortals,

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:12.840
Carefree, without worries or troubles.

00:15:13.919 --> 00:15:17.000
Good! Good! Good!

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.960
I give no credit, I owe no debts,

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:32.240
Sleeping till the sun is high each day.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.279
My daughter-in-law cooks the meal,

00:15:35.759 --> 00:15:39.159
Only then do I turn over in bed.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:52.039
It's not hard to learn from me,

00:15:52.399 --> 00:15:55.519
First learn to eat, then learn to dress.

00:15:55.759 --> 00:16:00.240
Three days no combing, five days no washing,

00:16:00.679 --> 00:16:06.000
Naturally you'll become an immortal. An immortal.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.240
Good! Good!

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:18.519
Did you see that fat kid just now?

00:16:18.519 --> 00:16:19.639
What? Who?

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.679
Looks like that Fan Sha'er who got buried alive.

00:16:22.919 --> 00:16:24.679
It's practically seeing a ghost.

00:16:24.679 --> 00:16:26.320
How could two people look exactly the same?

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.279
Who cares if he's human or ghost.

00:16:28.679 --> 00:16:29.600
Mind your own business.

00:16:29.879 --> 00:16:30.679
I tell you, brothers.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.159
Young Master Huo was really generous this time.

00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:35.039
Earned more than running several jobs.

00:16:35.039 --> 00:16:36.039
Let's go, drink at the old tavern ahead.

00:16:36.159 --> 00:16:37.200
Let's go, let's go, drink at the old tavern.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.399
Let's go.

00:16:40.519 --> 00:16:41.679
Young Master Huo.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:43.919
Oh no.

00:16:44.919 --> 00:16:45.799
Troupe Leader Wen.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.360
I'm a genuine Sichuan opera fan.

00:16:48.679 --> 00:16:49.320
Look.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.799
These costumes I've collected.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.480
Every single one is a treasure of mine.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.039
Look.

00:16:54.919 --> 00:16:57.480
They... they look better than what you're wearing, Troupe Leader Wen.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.919
Commander Qin, I went the wrong way.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.879
Troupe Leader Wen, Troupe Leader Wen.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:01.440
Otherwise...

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.399
Otherwise, let me change one for you, Troupe Leader Wen.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.159
Troupe Leader Wen.

00:17:05.039 --> 00:17:05.480
Troupe Leader Wen.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.320
Don't touch me.

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.840
Let me change one for you, Troupe Leader Wen.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:10.880
Troupe Leader Wen.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.400
Let me change one for you, Troupe Leader Wen.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.079
Let go of me.

00:17:15.559 --> 00:17:16.240
What do you mean?

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:16.880
Let go of me.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:17.519
Stop.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.240
I'm just changing clothes for you.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.440
I don't mean anything else, Troupe Leader Wen.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.799
Let go of me, don't.

00:17:22.759 --> 00:17:23.480
Troupe Leader Wen.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.279
Whenever I see you opera singers,

00:17:30.279 --> 00:17:31.279
I get particularly excited.

00:17:31.279 --> 00:17:33.119
I just want to connect with you, Troupe Leader Wen.

00:17:33.119 --> 00:17:33.759
No other meaning.

00:17:33.759 --> 00:17:35.480
Don't, Commander Qin, let go of me.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.119
Let go of me.

00:17:39.119 --> 00:17:39.880
Troupe Leader Wen.

00:17:41.079 --> 00:17:41.480
Let go of me.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.039
Listen to me.

00:17:42.039 --> 00:17:43.720
I just simply want to take a nap.

00:17:44.039 --> 00:17:45.240
Don't touch me.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.920
Don't, Commander Qin, let go of me.

00:17:48.359 --> 00:17:49.880
Commander Qin, let go of me.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:50.759
What?

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:52.960
Commander Qin.

00:17:53.279 --> 00:17:54.079
Drinking.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.160
Get out.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.200
Troupe Leader Wen.

00:17:56.359 --> 00:17:57.039
Commander Qin.

00:17:57.799 --> 00:17:59.440
What's so special about opera singers?

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.640
I told you to get out.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.720
Don't ruin my good time.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:02.400
Get out.

00:18:03.559 --> 00:18:05.319
Let go of me, don't touch me.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:06.319
Don't touch.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.400
Master Wen, let's go.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.279
Commander Qin

00:18:22.799 --> 00:18:23.640
Commander Qin

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:26.440
Young Master

00:18:26.519 --> 00:18:27.039
Fan Bao

00:18:27.359 --> 00:18:28.880
Is this the fastest thing you could find?

00:18:29.119 --> 00:18:29.680
Here

00:18:31.559 --> 00:18:32.759
Wheelbarrow

00:18:33.519 --> 00:18:34.759
It's slower than running

00:18:35.039 --> 00:18:37.039
It's so late, where was I supposed to find a sedan chair?

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.680
You screw-up

00:18:40.079 --> 00:18:40.720
Commander Qin

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:46.720
Stop

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:47.720
What are you doing?

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.079
Here, use this

00:18:52.519 --> 00:18:53.240
Look at Commander Qin

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.839
Why are you grabbing me?

00:18:55.839 --> 00:18:56.519
Cut the crap

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.680
Check on Commander Qin

00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.400
Behave yourself

00:18:59.519 --> 00:19:00.400
Ow, ow, ow

00:19:00.519 --> 00:19:01.599
Let go, let go, let go

00:19:01.799 --> 00:19:02.640
Master Wen, get on

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.680
Fan Bao, let's go

00:19:03.839 --> 00:19:04.559
What about you?

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.119
Don't worry about me

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:06.960
Go

00:19:07.559 --> 00:19:08.559
Yu Zhen came to see me

00:19:08.559 --> 00:19:09.400
She said she misses you very much

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.559
She will definitely wait for your return

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.559
Okay. Tell Yu Zhen...

00:19:11.759 --> 00:19:12.839
I miss her too

00:19:13.119 --> 00:19:14.079
I will definitely go back to find her

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:14.640
Go

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:16.920
Why are you pushing it?

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.400
I can't ride

00:19:20.079 --> 00:19:20.920
Master Wen, you ride

00:19:21.039 --> 00:19:22.079
I can't ride either

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:23.599
Xuanjizi

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.559
Take Master Wen back to Weiyuan immediately

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.640
I can't ride either

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.960
Then how did you get here just now?

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:29.920
I pushed it here

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:31.640
You screw-up

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:33.599
Master Wen, Fan Bao

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.200
Go, go, hurry up and go

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.519
Go, go, go

00:19:36.519 --> 00:19:37.000
Go

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:37.640
Hurry up

00:19:39.799 --> 00:19:41.039
Xiu Gu and the others don't know yet

00:19:41.359 --> 00:19:42.319
I have to go back and get them

00:19:43.279 --> 00:19:44.559
It's too late, it's too late

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.519
Xiu Gu saved my life

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:47.960
Save yourself first

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:48.960
Only then can you repay the kindness

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.839
Don't worry, the secret recipe is still with Xiu Gu

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.759
Commander Qin wouldn't touch this money tree

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:53.759
Listen

00:19:53.759 --> 00:19:55.000
I... I'll go back and tell them

00:19:55.279 --> 00:19:56.279
If you're leaving, go west

00:19:57.119 --> 00:19:57.559
Okay

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:00.519
Wait, wait, wait

00:20:01.039 --> 00:20:02.480
I haven't finished speaking yet

00:20:06.039 --> 00:20:06.960
Take this

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.640
Remember, keep going west

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.359
If you see anyone with a gun, shout "Report"

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:11.039
Okay

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.640
I'm counting on you for Xiu Gu

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:14.519
No problem

00:20:23.599 --> 00:20:25.440
Why are you tying me up?

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.240
I told you it was that Fan guy who hit him!

00:20:29.079 --> 00:20:30.079
Boss Fan

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.519
You were clearly the only one here

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.640
Why don't you believe me?

00:20:35.359 --> 00:20:37.200
How could I possibly harm Commander Qin?

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.880
Don't try to shift the blame

00:20:39.559 --> 00:20:42.000
Ever since Commander Qin and Boss Fan started cooperating

00:20:42.079 --> 00:20:43.640
You punk have been holding a grudge

00:20:43.839 --> 00:20:44.960
Who else could it be but you?

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.000
It has to be you

00:20:46.519 --> 00:20:47.079
I...

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:49.519
Commander

00:20:50.759 --> 00:20:51.319
Commander

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:53.680
Commander, Commander

00:20:55.359 --> 00:20:56.640
Commander Qin, you're awake

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.000
Catch him! Catch him!

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.880
Hear that? Even Commander Qin wants to arrest you

00:21:00.079 --> 00:21:02.079
Look clearly, Commander Qin

00:21:03.559 --> 00:21:04.200
Named...

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.680
Named Fan

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:06.279
See?

00:21:07.079 --> 00:21:08.039
Hurry up and chase him

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.880
You... aren't you going to untie me?

00:21:22.759 --> 00:21:23.319
Did you find him?

00:21:23.319 --> 00:21:23.960
No

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:24.920
Go, this way

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:30.039
Nothing

00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:30.599
Let's go

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.640
Did anyone see him go out?

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.200
No

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:10.519
Boss.

00:22:11.279 --> 00:22:12.720
Which way is west?

00:22:12.839 --> 00:22:14.000
Cang Mountain is to the west.

00:22:14.319 --> 00:22:15.279
Head towards Cang Mountain.

00:23:15.079 --> 00:23:15.920
You messing with me?

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.480
Which bastard put the sign up backwards again?

00:23:52.119 --> 00:23:52.640
Don't move.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:54.640
Keep going west.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.359
If you see a gun, shout "Report."

00:23:56.839 --> 00:23:57.359
Report!

00:23:57.519 --> 00:23:58.240
Report what?

00:23:58.319 --> 00:23:59.240
Who are you reporting to?

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.200
I'm not holding anything.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:03.440
Nothing at all.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.079
Which hero goes there?

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:16.279
Kite flies in the sky, leopard chases on the ground.

00:24:20.119 --> 00:24:20.720
Corn.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.359
Eggplant! Don't move.

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:24.839
What?

00:24:27.519 --> 00:24:29.000
How many people? Speak up.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.839
Just me.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:48.279
I'm back.

00:24:48.359 --> 00:24:48.839
You're back.

00:24:50.559 --> 00:24:51.160
What are you doing?

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:51.640
Move.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.279
Move.

00:24:54.759 --> 00:24:56.559
No, what do you mean?

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.480
Say something. What do you mean?

00:25:07.319 --> 00:25:08.400
Is it up this way?

00:25:08.599 --> 00:25:09.079
Move.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.359
Move, move, move.

00:25:26.599 --> 00:25:27.200
Move it.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.039
Untie me.

00:25:47.759 --> 00:25:48.680
That's better.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:58.920
Tie him up.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.720
Why are you tying me up again?

00:26:37.799 --> 00:26:38.400
Commander

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:39.559
Commander

00:26:42.559 --> 00:26:43.240
Did he talk?

00:26:43.319 --> 00:26:43.880
He did.

00:26:44.039 --> 00:26:44.920
What did he say?

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.680
As soon as I came in, he started hitting me.

00:26:50.319 --> 00:26:51.960
How can you treat a brother who risks his life for you...

00:26:52.079 --> 00:26:53.039
...so cruelly?

00:26:53.559 --> 00:26:56.720
That's what I'm saying.

00:26:57.079 --> 00:26:57.920
Commander.

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.599
What do you want me to say? Just ask me.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.200
You didn't tell him?

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.119
What he needs to confess?

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.200
You told me to come in and just do it.

00:27:14.839 --> 00:27:16.759
What kind of person is Division Commander Liao?

00:27:17.559 --> 00:27:18.680
You know very well.

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.279
That you could get out of there so easily...

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.200
They told me...

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.000
...to be extra cautious.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:27.160
Commander.

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:28.880
I've followed you for so many years.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.519
I've carried out the most secret missions.

00:27:30.759 --> 00:27:33.240
Whoever rebels, I would never rebel.

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.920
You don't even trust me?

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:36.960
Jizi.

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.279
I do trust you.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.759
Don't you know what kind of person I am?

00:27:42.839 --> 00:27:43.839
It's them.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.720
They keep pressuring me.

00:27:47.359 --> 00:27:48.200
Saying that I just...

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.000
...crawled out of that adjutant's trap.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.240
I almost lost my life.

00:27:53.079 --> 00:27:54.720
Telling me that from now on...

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.920
...I should be more cautious.

00:27:58.960 --> 00:27:59.640
Jizi.

00:28:00.839 --> 00:28:01.960
If you have anything to say...

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.160
...just confess honestly to them.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.599
What exactly am I supposed to confess?

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:12.559
Tell me the whole story clearly.

00:28:16.839 --> 00:28:18.960
I was still wetting the bed at eight.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.640
I wore split-crotch pants until I was ten.

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:24.680
At fifteen...

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:25.839
Hey, hey, hey.

00:28:26.319 --> 00:28:27.599
Are you trying to be smart with me?

00:28:29.039 --> 00:28:31.200
Then what age should I start confessing from?

00:28:34.319 --> 00:28:35.319
Let me give you a hint.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.599
Where did that thing on you come from?

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.440
What thing on me?

00:28:40.839 --> 00:28:42.720
You've already confiscated everything.

00:28:44.359 --> 00:28:46.039
Is this place the West?

00:28:46.279 --> 00:28:47.720
I want to head West.

00:28:48.039 --> 00:28:48.880
If it isn't...

00:28:49.119 --> 00:28:52.319
Let me out and I'll start over.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.000
Are you playing tricks on me?

00:28:54.359 --> 00:28:56.240
Do you think this place is a market?

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.319
Where you can come and go as you please?

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.119
Xuanjizi.

00:29:03.519 --> 00:29:06.279
You bastard, you're wronging me!

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.359
I'm the one who's wronged!

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:11.279
I earned this money with my own sweat and blood.

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.960
I brought it specifically to expand your army.

00:29:13.079 --> 00:29:14.359
Are you sure this money...

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.680
...was all earned by your hard work?

00:29:17.759 --> 00:29:18.680
Others earned some of it too.

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.000
I brought it all back.

00:29:20.319 --> 00:29:21.440
Besides this...

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:23.839
...is there nothing else?

00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:28.359
Yes, yes, yes. A lucky general.

00:29:28.559 --> 00:29:29.519
I found a lucky general for you.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:31.559
What lucky general?

00:29:33.839 --> 00:29:34.599
He didn't come?

00:29:38.319 --> 00:29:39.400
You're asking me?

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.759
No, Commander, let me explain.

00:29:43.039 --> 00:29:45.319
I failed to turn Division Commander Liao's subordinate.

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.720
So I tricked Division Commander Liao.

00:29:46.759 --> 00:29:48.200
I told him I could find him a lucky general.

00:29:48.559 --> 00:29:49.400
He believed me.

00:29:49.599 --> 00:29:50.680
And let me go.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:51.839
After I got out...

00:29:52.039 --> 00:29:53.160
I searched high and low.

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.759
And I really did find a lucky general.

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:55.680
Of course, Commander.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.720
That lucky general is reserved specially for you.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:59.200
Along the way...

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.640
I've been observing this lucky general.

00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:02.359
I believe he can definitely assist you.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:07.400
Where is he?

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.480
This Sha'er...

00:30:16.599 --> 00:30:18.680
Where on earth did you run off to?

00:30:18.799 --> 00:30:20.759
Who did you catch? It's not sorted out yet.

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:21.720
It's a total mess.

00:30:22.279 --> 00:30:24.319
Others are doing their duty, yet you have to interfere.

00:30:24.559 --> 00:30:25.759
Do you insist on running the show?

00:30:25.759 --> 00:30:26.720
Cut the noise.

00:30:26.839 --> 00:30:28.319
The Boss decides everything.

00:30:28.559 --> 00:30:29.599
Eldest Brother.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.680
Young Master Fan! Young Master Fan!

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:32.319
Brother Fan.

00:30:32.319 --> 00:30:33.400
What are you doing here?

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:34.279
Brother Fan.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.799
In the opera house.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.119
We met once.

00:30:39.559 --> 00:30:40.559
Scarface.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.680
It was more than just meeting once.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:43.319
Brother Fan.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.519
I really must thank you.

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.480
That night when my brothers and I took action...

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:47.960
...thanks to Brother Fan's generous help.

00:30:48.279 --> 00:30:49.039
You're too kind.

00:30:49.039 --> 00:30:49.720
That's right.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.759
He's the one who stole your family's grain.

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.920
You dummy, you didn't even recognize him.

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.119
That night, you opened the door for him.

00:30:57.119 --> 00:30:58.720
You opened the door for him. It was him.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:00.759
Never mind all that.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.279
We're all friends now.

00:31:02.799 --> 00:31:04.039
Just untie me first.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:08.279
Brother Fan.

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.359
I really feel sorry for you.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.400
You'd risk it all for your brothers.

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.759
But now you're about to die...

00:31:13.839 --> 00:31:14.599
...and where are your brothers?

00:31:14.759 --> 00:31:16.559
None of them are stepping up to speak for you.

00:31:16.759 --> 00:31:18.079
Are you even human?

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.160
You stole the grain, yet here you are stirring the pot.

00:31:20.359 --> 00:31:21.200
Why don't you step up then?

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:22.559
If I were his brother...

00:31:22.559 --> 00:31:23.799
...I'd definitely step up.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:24.680
See this?

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:26.640
I got this scar for my brother.

00:31:27.119 --> 00:31:28.480
Save the talk. Untie me.

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:30.240
Move aside.

00:31:32.799 --> 00:31:33.880
Why are you here again?

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.240
What's the deal with that tiger amulet?

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.799
A fortune teller gave it to me.

00:31:51.799 --> 00:31:52.759
What about it?

00:31:53.079 --> 00:31:54.200
Not talking, huh?

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.440
What exactly am I supposed to say?

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:05.599
Tiger Ma has orders.
