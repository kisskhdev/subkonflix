WEBVTT

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.600
The Divine Machine Battalion of our Great Ming

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.520
bears the heavy responsibility of guarding the capital

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.600
and preparing for campaigns abroad.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.600
You have managed the Divine Machine Battalion for over three years.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.520
Regarding the position of Minister of War,

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.040
I intend to recommend you to His Majesty.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.640
What are your thoughts on this?

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.440
I am overwhelmed with trepidation.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.680
The position of Minister of War

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.600
has long been coveted by the Eastern Depot.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.520
I fear that...

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.400
Last night, Li Chenyang

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.720
was hijacked at the execution ground,

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.640
and Feng Hai of the Eastern Depot was assassinated.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.920
You must have heard about it.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.320
If I can take on this great responsibility,

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.960
I will certainly know my place

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.160
and serve the Eunuch Lord with my life.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.920
Do you know why His Majesty

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.560
keeps the Divine Machine Battalion's

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.680
former General Lin Feng's

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.000
sword

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.240
and musket enshrined here?

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.400
Three years ago, General Lin Feng

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.720
led three hundred soldiers of the Divine Machine Battalion

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.200
to set an ambush in the canyon,

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.520
luring ten thousand Oirat cavalry to approach.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.200
They resisted until the very last moment,

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.640
allowing Eunuch Lord Wang to lead reinforcements in time

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.600
to strike the Oirat

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.920
and win a great victory.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.000
General Lin and the three hundred soldiers died in glory.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.880
Ming soldiers must take this as an example.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.360
A small gift.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.680
Please accept it, General.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.200
Thank you, Eunuch Lord Wang.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.680
This is the weapon of a guard who followed me for years.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.040
I remember his name was Ya.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.880
He served the Eastern Depot Eunuch Lord Shang Hua.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.560
Until five years ago,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.400
when I became the Eunuch Lord of the Western Depot

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.320
and took control of all Ming guards.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.480
He came to serve me.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.200
I am not a narrow-minded person.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.560
But he...

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.600
tried to kill me with this dagger.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.200
In the end,

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.560
he became a ghost under the blade.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.800
I will not fail Eunuch Lord Wang's kindness.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.840
Keep everything hidden in your heart,

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.200
and show nothing on your face.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.520
In this imperial capital,

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.080
I see all kinds of guards every day.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.360
I keep thinking,

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.040
why don't they kill me right now?

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.720
If I were a Divine Machine Battalion soldier or a guard,

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.400
I would shoot and kill me.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:45.560
Right now.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.520
At this very moment.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.040
But you have never done so.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.640
Why?

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.600
I dare not.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.880
Think carefully.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.440
Who exactly are you and I sacrificing our lives for?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.480
Do not speculate wildly.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.200
Rebels infiltrated Linggu Temple.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.720
Such an absurd thing,

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.160
do you believe it?

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.560
I'd rather believe

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.560
that the Snow Woman Dou E has appeared,

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.320
and Li Chenyang learned sorcery.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.240
I heard that those who died at Linggu Temple

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.880
were all Eastern Depot sleeper agents.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.720
The Western Depot suffered again.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.040
Let me tell you,

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.320
tonight, many high officials and nobles

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.240
in luxury carriages

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.520
went towards the palace.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.520
Is something big going to happen?

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.600
I heard it is to pay respects

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.920
at the prayer lantern festival held by Master Konghui.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.840
Inviting

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.240
officials of the fourth rank and above with their families.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.160
Consort Wan is hosting it personally.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.800
My Lord.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.280
Remember what I instructed.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.240
When the palace lantern rises, all is well.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.000
Lord Pei, Lord Zhang.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:20.640
Excuse me.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.760
For today's prayer lantern festival in the palace,

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.520
no one is allowed to carry weapons into the palace.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.960
Accompanying guards and coachmen

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.880
must wait outside the palace.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.480
Very well.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:29.760
You return to the Grand Court of Justice first.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.000
No need to wait here.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.760
Yes, my Lord.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.640
No matter how audacious they are,

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.840
they wouldn't dare trespass

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.080
into the heavily guarded Inner Court.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.560
If you intend to shield them,

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.320
you should see the situation clearly tonight.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.600
The one from the Western Depot

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.600
is bound to make a move tonight.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.360
If Zhang Yi brings Tang Xi into the palace,

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.880
wouldn't it be a desperate struggle?

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.520
Embroidered Uniform Guard, listen up.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.200
Here.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.880
Strictly check the identities of maids and eunuchs at the lantern festival.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.840
Prevent Tang Xi and his kind from sneaking in.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.280
If discovered,

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.320
bring them to me immediately.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.680
Yes, sir.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.320
Rather than falling into the Western Depot's hands,

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.520
it is better to strike first.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.440
Zhang Yi, do not do anything foolish.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.240
Shuimo, Danqing.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.600
Why have you returned?

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.000
Shouldn't you be at the palace gate

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.680
waiting for Lord Pei and Vice Minister Zhang?

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.760
Our master

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.280
never cares for such tedious formalities.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.000
Wait until the prayer lanterns

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.080
rise within the palace tonight.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.800
Danqing.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.480
There are still many files to organize.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.200
Shuimo, wait for me.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:48.760
You talk too much.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.800
Only by acting as usual will no suspicion arise.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.240
Reporting, my lord.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.720
We have safely escorted Vice Minister Zhang

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.000
into the palace for the lantern festival.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.240
From here on,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.760
it all depends on

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.920
the two of them and their fate.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.200
If you ask me,

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.680
Lord Zhang this time is like

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.280
Wu Dalang marrying a wife in *Water Margin*.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.440
What does that mean?

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.720
It bodes ill rather than well.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.000
I told you to read *Water Margin*.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.560
You only read useless things.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.280
That storyteller stuff...

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.960
Gu Gong Dan Fu,

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.160
came galloping at dawn,

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:28.960
along the western riverbanks,

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.720
arriving at the foot of Mount Qi.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.680
What I can do for Zhang Yi

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.440
ends here.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.400
I hope the prayer lanterns in the palace tonight

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.160
rise as usual.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.440
You infiltrate the Inner Palace.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.280
You must be extra careful.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.280
Find them

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.280
and regroup as soon as possible.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.360
I await your good news.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.720
Do not be impatient.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.200
Your Highness.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.480
Consort Wan.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.360
Consort Xian is here to pay her respects.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.720
No one stays in favor forever,

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.240
just as no flower blooms for a hundred days.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.000
She certainly chooses to come

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.440
when one is out of favor and luck.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.120
Consort Xian pays her respects to the Noble Consort.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.400
May the Noble Consort enjoy ten thousand blessings.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.200
You are usually busy attending to the Empress, Sister.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.720
How did you find time today?

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:12.960
To come to my palace...

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.800
...and visit this old woman?

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.280
Perhaps...

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.640
...you have run into some trouble?

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:18.960
You jest, Sister.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.720
The difficulties I encounter...

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.000
...are but a lonely courtyard where spring fades late.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.600
Over the years, I have grown accustomed to it.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:26.920
Unlike you, Sister.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.320
You have obtained what every woman...

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.960
...in this world desires most.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.640
It is truly enviable.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.680
It is rare indeed...

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.960
...to hear you speak such dispirited words.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.640
They are clearly the honest truth.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.640
At my age...

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.400
...to still hope for a child...

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.920
...is the true joke of the palace.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.040
Bring it here.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.520
His Majesty specially ordered the Sewing Bureau...

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.200
...to tailor a ritual prayer dress for you, Sister.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.760
The Empress has already inspected it...

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:54.960
...and specially ordered me to deliver it...

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.240
...and assist you in dressing up.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:00.840
Insolence!

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.200
How does the Sewing Bureau conduct its business?

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.800
Do they think this phoenix pattern...

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.320
...is something I am permitted to wear?

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.680
Please quell your anger, Noble Consort.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.120
The pattern on this dress was drawn by His Majesty himself.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.720
The Sewing Bureau worked seven nights to rush it.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.320
It was not us acting on our own authority.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.800
Otherwise, it would not have been sent to the Empress...

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.160
...for review before being brought here.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.280
The moon on the sea is the moon in the sky.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.440
The one before your eyes is the one in his heart.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.440
Most women in the harem lose favor as beauty fades.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.040
Their honor and disgrace are tied to their family's favor.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.680
You, Sister, are like a phoenix spreading its wings.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.000
You have held favor in the harem for over eighteen years.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.080
Now you even have the Little Prince by your side.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.560
Do you still not understand...

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.720
...the weight you hold in His Majesty's heart?

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.680
So what if I understand?

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.240
Nowadays...

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.200
...no matter how much I dress up...

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.880
...I cannot withstand the ravages of time.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.120
All women in the world desire quiet and peaceful years...

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.680
...and to halt the fleeting prime of youth.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.440
But a woman's life...

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.720
...is like a spring flower budding...

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.000
...blooming with the brilliance of summer flowers...

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.440
...mature and bright like autumn leaves...

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.800
...and pure and imposing like winter snow.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.520
Everything one experiences...

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.280
...is a gift.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.280
Compared to the newcomers in the palace...

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:43.800
...amidst their natural charm...

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.760
...you possess more steadiness and dignity.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.800
Rather than worrying about a fading reflection...

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.240
...it is better to ensure one does not lose one's heart.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.280
Thank you for your trouble today, Sister.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.400
Then I shall go report back to the Empress.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.480
May the Noble Consort's prayers today...

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.520
...go smoothly.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.520
Did you get the key?

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:19.640
I got it.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.480
Halt, you servants ahead!

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.040
The Prayer Lantern Festival is about to begin.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.600
We are strictly checking everyone's identity.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:27.840
Reporting to my lord...

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:28.680
I...

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:29.600
How dare you!

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.400
You dare to stop Consort Xian?

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.760
You mindless fools!

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.440
The Prayer Lantern Festival is about to begin.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.160
Consort Xian...

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.680
...must accompany the Empress's carriage.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.280
If the hour is missed...

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.320
...and blame is assigned...

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.760
...how many heads do you have to lose?

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.240
The Eunuch is right to remind us.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.360
We were rash.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.360
Please forgive us, Consort Xian.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.000
Consort Xian...

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:05.440
Please.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.840
Greetings, Superintendent of the Eastern Depot.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.080
Deputy Commander of the Embroidered Uniform Guard.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.280
I wonder why your Excellencies have visited the Grand Court of Justice.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.440
What business brings you here?

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.520
We received information.

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.560
Suspecting that Minister Pei Yuandong of the Grand Court...

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.520
...and Lord Zhang Yi...

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:32.760
...will be harmed by villains.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.800
So we came specifically to investigate.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.480
Superintendent, you worry too much.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.840
Lord Pei and Lord Zhang...

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.240
...were personally escorted by us into the palace...

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.080
...to attend Consort Wan's prayer lantern festival.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.800
How could they be harmed at the Grand Court?

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:44.840
Ignorant fool.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.720
A mere Grand Court of Justice...

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.760
...what right does it have to question our words?

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:50.000
Men!

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.520
Search the Grand Court from top to bottom.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.880
Leave no stone unturned.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.600
The Li Chenyang case is settled.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.920
Vice Minister Zhang contributed greatly and was rewarded by His Majesty.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.520
You look radiant right now.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.040
Doesn't it feel like spring is in the air?

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.320
Could it be that good things are happening one after another?

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.720
Is there some good news you want to announce to us?

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.480
Minister Wang, you are teasing me.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.040
That the Grand Court could solve the case and escape trouble...

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.040
...is already a great fortune.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:34.640
If...

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.160
...Li Chenyang had been handled by the Ministry of Justice...

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:38.680
Minister Wang...

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.400
...you might not have fared any better than I did.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:43.720
Lord Zhang.

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.560
Now you are making things up out of nothing.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:46.720
That Li Chenyang...

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.520
...was supposed to be the Grand Court's responsibility.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.000
What does it have to do with us?

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.160
Minister Yuan.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.400
You be the judge.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:55.800
It is quite good.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:56.560
No...

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.520
What kind of talk is that?

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:00.800
Minister Wang.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.920
The dust has settled on this matter.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.400
The outcome was decided by His Majesty.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.800
Naturally, it is exceptionally good.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.520
It seems Minister Yuan...

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.920
...is truly an expert at judging matters.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.120
No wonder your family is harmonious.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.760
With a kind mother and filial son.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.040
You are envious?

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.760
Then go ahead.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.320
My Yuan Ling is not yet married.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.920
If Minister Wang shows such favor...

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.200
...it is us who are unworthy of the honor.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.560
Greetings, Eunuch Lord Shang.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.800
Everyone, no need for formalities.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.400
Continue, please continue.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:45.880
Vice Minister Zhang.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.720
I just looked around.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.600
I did not see Minister Pei of the Grand Court.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.360
I wonder where Lord Pei has gone.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.760
When Lord Pei first arrived...

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.200
...he suddenly felt unwell.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:58.600
At this moment...

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.080
...he is likely relieving himself.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.320
Vice Minister Zhang.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.000
Nature calls.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.320
If it is urgent...

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.480
...how can he be so slow?

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.440
I was merely delayed by something.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.680
Arriving late.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.000
Stop talking nonsense here.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.200
And demeaning yourself.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:19.280
My Lord.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:22.920
Lord Pei.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.520
What was it that delayed you?

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.520
I went across to check on my second wife.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.360
It is my wife's first time attending a palace banquet.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.280
She is inevitably a bit nervous.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.760
I just went to give her a few words of advice.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.120
To avoid any mistakes.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.960
I see, I see.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.200
Everyone, please continue.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:02.880
I miscalculated.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.200
I didn't expect Zhang Yi to do the exact opposite.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:06.880
Letting them so boldly impersonate

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.680
the families of court officials to sneak into the palace.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:10.760
Exposing them now

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.720
would undoubtedly be letting them walk right into

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.480
the Western Depot's dragnet.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.120
Lord Zhang.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:18.920
I certainly don't recall

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.200
that Lord Pei's second wife

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.680
is Yuan Ran.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:23.840
She is as of today.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.240
In that case,

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.200
Tang Xi has also snuck in among the female relatives.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.080
What do you mean "snuck in"?

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.360
Those over there are all

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.360
respectable female relatives.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:32.440
Watch your mouth.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.520
For what purpose

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.560
do you risk your lives to sneak into the palace?

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.320
Naturally, to pray for the common people.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.440
Wishing for peace and prosperity.

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.640
This lady looks unfamiliar.

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.520
May I ask which official's family you belong to?

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.400
It is Lord Pei Yuandong's family.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.880
His newly wedded second wife.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:55.720
Ah, Lord Pei.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.840
Lord Pei certainly has it tough.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.040
I have it tough too.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.840
Lady Pei, please wait a moment longer.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.160
Once the prayer ceremony ends,

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.080
we can leave the palace.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:09.960
Thank you, Auntie.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.200
Consort Wan arrives!

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:23.000
Your Highness, long live, long live, long live!

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.400
Consort Wan has changed her attire.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.240
She must have discovered the key is lost.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.240
If I am not mistaken,

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.520
the master of ceremonies leading the team

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:47.120
appears to be Eunuch Lord Wang of the Western Depot.

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.280
Have you gentlemen received

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.240
His Majesty's edict pardoning Eunuch Lord Wang?

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.440
That depends on the Emperor's will.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.880
After all, Eunuch Lord Wang is not under our jurisdiction.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.640
My lords,

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.000
as the Prayer Lantern Festival begins,

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.080
in Consort Wan's palace,

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.320
an item gifted by His Majesty has gone missing.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:20.960
This is a grave matter.

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.720
To avoid damaging your reputations,

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.720
we will now conduct a full search.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.120
My lord, pardon the offense.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:33.800
Pardon the offense, my lord.

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:35.840
Routine procedure.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.880
Lord Wang, pardon the offense.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:41.160
Pardon the offense, Madam.

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.040
Forgive me, my lord.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:44.560
Pardon me.

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:46.760
My lord.

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:48.320
My lord.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.080
Pardon me.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.560
Pardon me, Madam.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.200
Reporting, my lord.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.040
We found nothing.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:07.640
Your Highness,

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.560
the female guests do not have your key.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.280
After we successfully take the key from Consort Wan,

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.240
Consort Wan will surely discover it is missing.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.560
Then the entire palace will be on lockdown.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.080
How will we evade the search

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.160
and leave the palace?

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:27.440
Disguise.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:29.880
No one is more skilled at

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.400
misdirection and substitution than you.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.440
Consort Wan wears the key on her person,

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.560
which means it is an exquisitely made key.

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:37.920
Once we have the key,

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.480
we must quickly disguise its appearance

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.240
to become the most common,

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.080
most easily overlooked item at the festival.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.080
I understand.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.200
That night, all the female guests will wear hairpins.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.920
We'll turn the key into a hairpin.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.640
I feel that is not safe enough.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.040
If they suspect our identities are fake,

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.400
they will definitely search thoroughly.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.200
Each of us, along with Yuan Ran and Wu Qiangu,

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:01.720
must learn how to move the key

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.640
quickly among

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:03.840
every female guest at the scene.

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.000
As long as, when we finally leave,

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.360
it returns to us, that will suffice.

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:13.640
Eunuch Lord Shang.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:15.400
Your Highness.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.480
Do you think I am here,

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.600
over some dispensable item,

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.240
troubling the entire court

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:24.520
just to put on a show?

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:32.640
Guards!

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.320
Bring Lord Pei Yuandong of the Grand Court of Justice

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.200
up here.

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:43.960
Embroidered Uniform Guard Deputy Commander Yin Feng

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.240
greets Your Highness.

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.240
We received reliable intelligence

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.120
that Minister Pei Yuandong of the Grand Court

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.800
might be harmed before tonight's lantern festival.

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.520
So we rushed to the Grand Court

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:55.560
to investigate.

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.840
We happened to save the unconscious Lord Pei.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.480
Commander Shen,

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.800
why do you not immediately arrest

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.440
this villain posing as Lord Pei?

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:40.880
Master Shen

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:44.400
Which side is your heart on?

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.640
Have you thought it through?

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.720
You dare bewitch minds at death's door?

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:50.960
Commander Shen

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.280
Do I really have to teach you

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:53.360
how to interrogate this villain?

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.720
Your subordinate dares not.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:58.520
Wu Qiangu

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.000
Why did you disguise yourself as a high official to enter the palace?

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:02.840
You...

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.160
what exactly is your intention?

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.360
I heard that tonight,

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.560
the Prayer Lantern Festival

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.040
is being personally organized by Consort Wan.

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.760
I have long wanted to witness

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.280
the grace of Her Highness the Consort.

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:18.720
I didn't expect

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:23.320
to run into the palace guards hunting a thief.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:31.880
The Embroidered Uniform Guard...

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.720
when did they become so soft-hearted,

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.960
allowing someone to be this arrogant?

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.680
Or is it your lack of discipline?

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:48.440
Speak!

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.640
Why did you specifically choose

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:51.880
to impersonate Master Pei Yuandong?

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.160
Speak!

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.160
Why did you specifically choose

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.880
to impersonate Master Pei Yuandong?

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.600
Among those near me of similar age,

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.800
there was only Master Pei.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:12.480
I actually wanted to copy you, Eunuch Lord Shang,

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.560
to copy Eunuch Lord Shang's appearance,

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.840
but I'd need the opportunity.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.800
What a loose tongue,

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.760
you insubordinate rebel!

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.160
If you don't confess who the mastermind is,

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:42.880
I will have you executed immediately

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.120
to set an example for all.

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:54.960
Superintendent Wang,

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.320
leave such a small matter to me,

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.800
so you don't dirty your hands.

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.040
Leave it to you?

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:04.960
What?

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:08.040
Do you want to make your Godfather

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.120
lose face again?

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.120
There is only one chance.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.960
If you can't grasp it, it won't belong to you.

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.000
I overstepped my bounds.

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:25.720
Will you speak or not?

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:26.400
Will you speak?

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:27.600
Will you speak?!

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.680
Going out now is suicide.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.680
If you get caught in this palace,

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.440
the entire Tang Clan will be implicated.

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.680
I can't just watch the weird old man...

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.480
If you and Zhang Yi jump out now,

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.440
everything we've done will fall short.

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.600
You will destroy the entire Tang Clan,

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.240
and he will destroy the entire Grand Court of Justice.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.360
Eunuch Lord Wang

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.280
Although I was saved by the Eastern Depot and Embroidered Uniform Guard,

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.160
as the Chief Minister of the Grand Court of Justice,

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:15.640
the laws of the Great Ming...

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.640
are still fresh in my mind.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.280
Impersonating a high court official,

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.200
claiming office without holding one,

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.360
for personal gain,

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.200
and assuming an official's name...

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:26.040
One hundred strokes and three years of penal servitude.

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.720
Yet you executing someone without authorization...

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.080
which article of the Great Ming Law is that based on?

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:35.240
Lord Pei, do you wish to shield this person?

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.000
I am merely speaking according to the facts.

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.000
I was unconscious when I was rescued.

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:42.400
Everyone knows that.

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:43.200
Very well.

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:45.480
One hundred strokes.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.000
Changed to one hundred lashes.

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.480
If Wang Zhi intends to whip Wu Qiangu,

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.520
after these one hundred lashes,

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:54.560
death is certain.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.120
Eunuch Lord Wang.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.160
This old man believes...

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.640
today is the seventh day since Master Konghui's passing.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.920
Buddhism forbids killing and slaughter.

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.240
On a day like this,

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:08.560
to insist on causing a bloodbath...

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.040
would affect the nation's fortune in the future,

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.520
and no one can bear that responsibility.

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.360
Consort Wan.

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:13.880
This absolutely must not happen.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.440
If any misfortune occurs later,

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.880
how will Your Highness face His Majesty

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.720
and explain today's events?

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.560
Please reconsider, Your Highness.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:33.560
Enough.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.080
The prayer lantern festival will continue.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.480
But thieves have infiltrated the palace,

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.000
and this matter involves the Grand Court of Justice.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.680
Detain the families of the Grand Court officials for now,

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.840
to prevent further trouble.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:55.840
Please.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:56.560
Lord Zhang.

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.520
Until the key is found,

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.840
no one is allowed to leave.

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:06.320
If there is any suspicious movement,

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:07.760
kill without mercy.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.480
Instead of saying these things,

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:11.600
you'd be better off warning

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.960
your godson, who isn't very sharp today.

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.520
Drag him away.

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.280
Girl.

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.360
Run!

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.880
I was born free.

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:07.880
And death...

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:11.160
must also be decided by myself.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.560
See you in the martial world.

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.120
Or never see you again.

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.080
You want to see...

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.760
what kind of illusion magic scenery?

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.040
Compared to landscapes, flowers, and birds,

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.920
I'd rather see the desert scenery of the Western Regions.

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:48.920
But your illusion magic is all fake.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.760
In the end, I have to imagine it myself.

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:52.920
Might as well go see it myself.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.480
Who says my illusion magic is fake?

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:58.680
Falsehood and truth,

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.000
real and fake intermingled.

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.160
If...

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.680
I let you see right here in the capital

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:08.800
the scenery of the great desert,

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:11.240
how do you plan to reward me?

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:17.920
What are you looking at?

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:21.040
The night before last was a mistake.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.000
A beautiful mistake.

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.640
What do you want?

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:34.600
What do I want?

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:37.560
I want...

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.760
you all to embrace the freedom of this world,

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:40.920
feel love,

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.760
and enjoy the life of ordinary people.

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:45.480
My brother-in-law told me these words.

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:46.360
And then?

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:47.720
He died.

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:22.680
It seems everything went smoothly.

00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:58.400
Your Highness.

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:23.160
Let's go.

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.240
Who are you?

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.000
I am Wan Zhen'er.

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:54.040
Nonsense.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.240
How dare you impersonate me?

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.200
In the entire Ming Dynasty,

00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.160
no one would dare do such a thing.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.000
Look at you now,

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.400
looking like neither human nor ghost.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.640
How are you worthy of the name Wan Zhen'er?

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:08.840
Your virtue does not match your status.

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:10.320
Disaster will surely follow.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:11.120
Insolence!

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:12.840
You lowly maid!

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.680
How dare you slander me like this!

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.320
Though I started as a palace maid,

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:17.920
I have served since childhood

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:19.240
by the side of Empress Dowager Sun.

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.800
At nineteen, I cared for His Majesty when he was two.

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.080
I shared the wealth when he was Crown Prince,

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.720
and I endured with him

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.200
the hardships when he was demoted to Prince of Yi.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:28.720
He respects me,

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:29.920
pities me,

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:30.680
and protects me.

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.800
Have I not treated him the same?

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.040
But you,

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:36.160
blinded by the lust for power,

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.520
plotted to let villains take his life,

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.080
harm his empire,

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:39.880
and harm his heirs.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.640
Can you face His Majesty after that?

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:47.720
Consort Wan!

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.040
Cover your mouth and nose, quickly!

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:50.800
Be careful not to inhale the Illusion Magic potion.

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:53.080
Consort Wan!

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:16.880
Wang Zhi!

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:17.800
Tell me,

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.040
did you do all of this today?

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.400
Why was there an explosion?

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:24.480
You organized this lantern festival single-handedly.

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:27.160
I never authorized the Western Depot to buy saltpeter.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.160
Where did this saltpeter come from?

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:30.800
Your Highness,

00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:32.240
this has nothing to do with me.

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.600
Do not trust that sorcerer's nonsense.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.240
Seize Wang Zhi!

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:37.960
Your Highness!

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:40.400
Superintendent Wang,

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:40.960
forgive me.

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:43.640
After all, this is Consort Wan's order.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:45.880
I believe His Majesty

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.240
will soon arrive with the Imperial Guard

00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:48.040
and the Embroidered Uniform Guard.

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:50.280
Everyone, stay calm.

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:51.720
Zhang Yi,

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.760
they have already escaped.

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:55.800
Commander Shen,

00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:59.120
go catch the escaped criminals at once!

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:00.520
Commander Yuan,

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.480
follow me out of the city to arrest Tang Xi and the others.

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:03.160
Yes, sir.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.960
It looks like we're going to die here today.

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:21.680
Tang Xi,

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:23.080
your martial arts are the best.

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.360
If there is a chance,

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:25.160
Don't worry.

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:26.960
You'll live longer than me.

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.120
They have us outnumbered.

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:29.160
We cannot fight for long.

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:30.840
Find a way to open the palace gates

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:32.280
and regroup with Lu Shijie.

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:33.640
You handle Shen Youzhi and his men.

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.080
Beauty, you handle those ninjas.

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:36.280
I'll go open the palace gates.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.360
Once the gates are open,

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:38.600
focus on escaping.

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:39.360
Do not linger in battle.

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:39.840
Okay.

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:40.680
Split up!

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:16.360
I am Fujii Musashi, the greatest swordsman of the East

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.000
Today, commissioned by the Western Depot

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.320
I come to take your heads

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:20.440
What a coincidence

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:22.400
The last person who dared call himself the greatest swordsman

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.200
...was buried just a few days ago

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.240
Even Japanese pirates must follow local customs

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.080
Vice Minister Zhang

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:34.800
Just now, Wu Qiangu

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.720
...was executed on the spot

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.240
You were coerced by bandits

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.480
...to flee to the palace gates

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.320
You need not worry anymore

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:47.480
Who said I was coerced?

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:48.320
Zhang Yi

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.640
It's not too late to turn back now

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.320
Hand over what you took

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:58.640
Or no one leaves here today

00:36:59.200 --> 00:36:59.960
You must know

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:02.480
...you are different from them

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:04.760
How am I different?

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:06.920
We are all doing the same thing

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.000
Here's a blade for you

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:24.640
For the sake of us once serving as officials together

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:26.640
...show some mercy

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:08.840
Stop chasing

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:12.720
Go

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:38.520
It's useless

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.040
You shouldn't have come in tonight

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:41.760
I felt like it

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:13.960
Is it worth risking your lives like this?

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:17.600
At such a young age

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.560
...you've learned to hesitate before even fighting

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:22.400
To die without fighting

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:23.600
...is so boring

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.160
Only by keeping on fighting

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:27.320
...can one avoid defeat

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.000
Even if I die

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:31.080
...I won't regret it

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:00.600
How are you doing?

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:01.880
Cut the crap

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:04.760
Qian Ben is here to help us

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:09.440
You two hold him off first

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.000
We'll go open the palace gates

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:12.680
Okay

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:29.400
Go help them, quick

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:30.280
Leave this to me

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.080
Qian Ben

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:38.680
Why?

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:51.960
Qian Ben!

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:57.240
Qian Ben!

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:07.800
Tang Xi, catch this

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:35.080
Qian Ben!

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:36.320
Why?

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:37.840
Why did you do this?

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:54.080
Qian Ben!

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:56.240
Qian Ben!

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:21.840
Today

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:23.680
...the rules of the martial world

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.080
...repay kindness with kindness

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:28.320
...and hatred with vengeance

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:29.720
It doesn't end until death

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:32.080
Enough!

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:35.160
Let's see who dares take a step forward!

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:38.760
In my imperial palace

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:41.880
...Japanese ninjas have appeared

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.520
Anyone who does not kill the foreign enemy

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.240
...but kills my Ming children instead

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:47.840
...shall be deemed a traitor

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.240
Kill without mercy!

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:55.960
Shen Youzhi!

00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:58.520
Even at the end, you are cowardly

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:00.760
What is the point of living?

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.040
Everyone, listen to my order!

00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:08.400
Everyone, listen to my order!

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.120
When we arrived

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:13.320
...Tang Xi and the others had already killed the Japanese thieves

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:14.360
...and escaped through the palace gate

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:15.600
Is that clear?

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:24.360
Why aren't you leaving yet?

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:27.120
Don't come back

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:33.000
Go

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:00.160
Where are Zhang Yi and Tang Xi?

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:07.920
Womanly benevolence

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:21.200
Superfluous emotions

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:22.480
...will all become

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.120
...stumbling blocks on your path to the peak of power

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:25.600
I...

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.760
...when have I ever disappointed you?

00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:58.080
Quick, quick, quick!

00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:58.520
Move it!

00:45:58.600 --> 00:45:58.960
Quick!

00:45:59.040 --> 00:45:59.400
Quick!

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:00.040
Quick!

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:00.880
Yuan Ran

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:03.080
Why are there only three of you?

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:03.920
Where is Old Wu?
