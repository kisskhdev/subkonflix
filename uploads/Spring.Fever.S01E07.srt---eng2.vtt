WEBVTT

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:16.765
Sun Han-gyul.

00:01:18.851 --> 00:01:20.436
That's his name.

00:01:25.941 --> 00:01:27.401
I'll come back for you.

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:29.862
I'll come for you two.

00:01:40.414 --> 00:01:41.290
EPISODE 7

00:01:41.373 --> 00:01:46.128
The number you have dialed is unavailable.
Please leave a voicemail after the beep.

00:01:48.047 --> 00:01:49.256
I told you clearly.

00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:52.509
If I don't hear from you today...

00:01:54.011 --> 00:01:55.095
you're dead to me.

00:01:57.348 --> 00:01:58.557
From now on,

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.268
you're nobody to me.

00:02:02.561 --> 00:02:04.480
I'm erasing your name,
your face, everything.

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.651
EDIT - DELETE

00:02:08.734 --> 00:02:09.610
DELETE?
YES

00:02:20.663 --> 00:02:21.497
YES
NO

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.123
BIG SIS

00:02:27.461 --> 00:02:32.967
THAT WOMAN

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.598
I...

00:02:40.224 --> 00:02:42.184
I haven't even touched
your fingernail, but...

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:44.687
But you had...

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.690
coffee with her...

00:02:49.733 --> 00:02:50.859
and held hands with her.

00:02:54.738 --> 00:02:55.656
So…

00:02:58.075 --> 00:03:00.369
you were mad at me because of that?

00:03:01.662 --> 00:03:04.832
You told me to trust you,
and you did that with another woman.

00:03:06.166 --> 00:03:07.376
You're right, Ms. Bom.

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:11.296
What?

00:03:13.257 --> 00:03:14.341
I, Sun Jae-gyu...

00:03:16.343 --> 00:03:17.845
don't keep my word.

00:03:18.637 --> 00:03:20.180
I'm not as strong as I look,

00:03:21.974 --> 00:03:26.186
and I'm not intelligent, cultured,
refined or patient.

00:03:31.734 --> 00:03:32.693
I'm sorry.

00:03:35.195 --> 00:03:36.363
I can't wait any longer.

00:04:48.727 --> 00:04:49.561
Ms. Bom.

00:04:50.312 --> 00:04:51.188
Ms. Bom.

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:53.565
Ms. Bom!

00:04:58.737 --> 00:04:59.571
Ms. Bom.

00:05:00.364 --> 00:05:03.408
I'm not normally like this.

00:05:04.493 --> 00:05:07.788
Why are you so impatient?

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:10.207
I'm sorry.

00:05:11.083 --> 00:05:14.503
A man's fiery heart
can only take so much. Gosh.

00:05:14.586 --> 00:05:15.504
Well,

00:05:16.505 --> 00:05:19.133
the one who started the fire
is partly responsible.

00:05:20.551 --> 00:05:23.387
Let's not talk about this anymore.

00:05:25.848 --> 00:05:26.682
But...

00:05:30.853 --> 00:05:33.272
you've got to tell me who she is.

00:05:36.066 --> 00:05:38.277
Who is she? An ex?

00:05:39.153 --> 00:05:41.488
A female friend? Or...

00:05:42.823 --> 00:05:43.907
your current girlfriend?

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:46.160
Absolutely not.

00:05:46.243 --> 00:05:47.286
Then who is she?

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.876
She's actually...

00:05:57.462 --> 00:05:59.339
-from insurance.
-From insurance?

00:06:00.632 --> 00:06:02.509
Who gets that close
with an insurance agent?

00:06:03.177 --> 00:06:04.469
Which type of insurance?

00:06:05.095 --> 00:06:06.763
What type of coverage is it?

00:06:08.765 --> 00:06:09.641
Well...

00:06:10.934 --> 00:06:12.144
What was it called?

00:06:13.812 --> 00:06:15.439
Actual expense health insurance.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.734
She said people live to be 100 these days,

00:06:18.817 --> 00:06:20.652
so I can't go without health insurance.

00:06:20.736 --> 00:06:23.572
Apparently, she's known as

00:06:24.156 --> 00:06:25.991
the Doberman of the insurance world.

00:06:26.074 --> 00:06:27.784
Once she bites, she never lets go.

00:06:27.868 --> 00:06:29.703
So, did she bite you?

00:06:29.786 --> 00:06:31.914
Come on, Ms. Bom.

00:06:32.831 --> 00:06:35.709
I'm the kind of guy
who's basically insurance himself.

00:06:36.251 --> 00:06:38.587
I never get sick,
so why bother with insurance?

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:39.880
Then she'll come back.

00:06:41.715 --> 00:06:42.549
That won't happen.

00:06:44.718 --> 00:06:45.969
If that woman comes back...

00:06:49.973 --> 00:06:51.016
I told you clearly.

00:06:52.976 --> 00:06:54.978
I erased your name, your face, everything.

00:06:56.605 --> 00:06:59.483
If you show up around here again...

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:03.946
you're dead.

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:08.909
All right, I understand.

00:07:12.621 --> 00:07:15.540
So, we're good now?

00:07:19.127 --> 00:07:23.006
I just need to wait two years
as we promised.

00:07:25.008 --> 00:07:26.218
Yes, two years.

00:07:27.594 --> 00:07:30.305
Right, two years.

00:07:33.433 --> 00:07:34.268
You should go.

00:07:35.269 --> 00:07:37.396
Sure. I'm off, then.

00:07:45.862 --> 00:07:48.156
-By the way...
-Yes, what is it?

00:07:48.949 --> 00:07:52.411
Don't we get a vacation or something?

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:54.830
-A vacation?
-Yes.

00:07:55.539 --> 00:07:56.999
What's a vacation for?

00:07:57.082 --> 00:07:59.167
Well, you see,

00:07:59.251 --> 00:08:02.004
vacations are meant to
improve productivity, right?

00:08:02.087 --> 00:08:02.963
So...

00:08:04.256 --> 00:08:08.218
if I could just spend a day with you,

00:08:08.302 --> 00:08:10.304
eat some good food, and go on a date,

00:08:11.138 --> 00:08:15.600
I think I could patiently wait
for two years.

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:22.566
Or maybe not?

00:08:25.694 --> 00:08:27.237
Just for a day, right?

00:08:27.946 --> 00:08:28.822
Yes.

00:08:30.657 --> 00:08:33.493
Just one day after Green Narae wraps up?

00:08:33.577 --> 00:08:35.954
You got it! Just one day.

00:08:41.501 --> 00:08:43.420
Are you really going to Shinsu?

00:08:43.503 --> 00:08:45.380
What do you mean, "stop"?

00:08:45.464 --> 00:08:48.884
My daughter, whom I haven't heard from
in over a year, called me at 7:48 a.m.

00:08:48.967 --> 00:08:50.844
asking for tickets
to Song Ga-in's concert.

00:08:50.927 --> 00:08:52.596
How could I stop? I should go for it.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:56.892
You got the wrong signal,
so back up first.

00:08:58.852 --> 00:09:01.063
What's going on?

00:09:01.146 --> 00:09:05.525
I thought Bom's sudden change of heart
was all part of your big picture.

00:09:12.824 --> 00:09:14.117
You said earlier,

00:09:14.993 --> 00:09:18.955
that if anything came up,
I should make sure to hire you.

00:09:22.042 --> 00:09:24.795
Unfortunately, I did...

00:09:25.754 --> 00:09:26.588
say that.

00:09:27.381 --> 00:09:31.551
I'd like to officially hire you
to handle the settlement...

00:09:33.887 --> 00:09:35.263
for Sun Jae-gyu's assault case.

00:09:39.643 --> 00:09:42.979
I was trying to draw the big picture,

00:09:43.063 --> 00:09:45.690
but my pencil slipped for a moment.

00:09:45.774 --> 00:09:49.194
How distracted were you
for your pencil to slip?

00:09:50.362 --> 00:09:52.072
There's no need to rush.

00:09:52.155 --> 00:09:54.699
If you can't do it,
just give me the address.

00:09:55.283 --> 00:09:56.576
I've already packed up,

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:00.205
so I'll go myself
and finish this face to face.

00:10:02.124 --> 00:10:03.834
Are you saying you can't trust me?

00:10:03.917 --> 00:10:06.586
Do you want a monthly report or something?

00:10:10.215 --> 00:10:12.259
Do you actually have a plan?

00:10:14.302 --> 00:10:15.971
So the thief

00:10:16.054 --> 00:10:19.057
got caught red-handed
in Jjang-gu's chili field?

00:10:19.141 --> 00:10:20.225
Who was it?

00:10:20.308 --> 00:10:22.686
Who took it all,
the meju and the gold medal?

00:10:22.769 --> 00:10:24.187
-A deer.
-A deer?

00:10:24.271 --> 00:10:26.398
There was a deer in the field...

00:10:26.481 --> 00:10:28.066
-Yeah.
-...and its neck was shining.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:29.484
-My goodness.
-It turns out

00:10:29.568 --> 00:10:31.987
it was wearing
Dong-pyo's grandma's gold medal.

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:33.405
My goodness.

00:10:35.323 --> 00:10:36.950
We blamed the wrong person.

00:10:37.033 --> 00:10:38.326
That could've been bad.

00:10:40.078 --> 00:10:42.247
My goodness. Look at that.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:43.665
Isn't that Mr. Evil Thoughts?

00:11:05.729 --> 00:11:07.647
Oh, dear. That's terrifying.

00:11:10.692 --> 00:11:12.944
It's such a beautiful day today!

00:11:15.071 --> 00:11:19.367
He plowed the field in the scorching sun.
Did the sun fry his brain?

00:11:19.451 --> 00:11:22.496
He's smiling like an idiot.
Where's he going?

00:11:34.841 --> 00:11:38.762
He graduated top of his class
in law at Hanguk University.

00:11:38.845 --> 00:11:41.765
He also finished
the 47th Judicial Training Institute

00:11:41.848 --> 00:11:44.100
at the top of his class.

00:11:46.353 --> 00:11:49.814
He was recognized for his exceptional
talent as a junior lawyer

00:11:50.774 --> 00:11:52.984
at Law Firm Sujun,

00:11:53.068 --> 00:11:56.321
winning the Outstanding New Lawyer Award.

00:11:59.824 --> 00:12:01.701
There's still a lot left.

00:12:01.785 --> 00:12:03.912
If you're going to go over
my whole résumé,

00:12:03.995 --> 00:12:06.122
your voice might give out, Mr. Hong.

00:12:18.134 --> 00:12:19.636
"Meet a successful professional."

00:12:20.554 --> 00:12:23.181
What do you all think success is?

00:12:24.099 --> 00:12:27.102
Here's what I think success really is.

00:12:29.854 --> 00:12:30.897
SOMEONE ON MY SIDE

00:12:36.653 --> 00:12:37.654
"Someone on my side"?

00:12:41.825 --> 00:12:43.868
Having someone fully on your side,

00:12:44.703 --> 00:12:46.746
is there anything
more successful than that?

00:12:48.123 --> 00:12:50.458
When I meet a client for the first time,

00:12:50.542 --> 00:12:52.711
I always start with this promise.

00:12:54.754 --> 00:12:56.506
"I'll be on your side."

00:13:08.518 --> 00:13:10.687
We all face unfair situations at times.

00:13:12.606 --> 00:13:14.941
Sometimes, people you trusted
turn their backs on you,

00:13:16.359 --> 00:13:18.486
and it feels like no one's on your side.

00:13:22.115 --> 00:13:22.949
Don't.

00:13:24.034 --> 00:13:26.161
Completely being on your side.

00:13:27.203 --> 00:13:30.498
That's what being a lawyer is all about.

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:47.724
Uncle.

00:13:51.895 --> 00:13:53.021
I need a small favor.

00:13:53.647 --> 00:13:57.150
Could you order some nice galbi
for the Green Narae field trip?

00:14:03.198 --> 00:14:04.491
Come on!

00:14:06.576 --> 00:14:08.161
What? Why?

00:14:08.244 --> 00:14:09.871
Did you lose some muscle in your jaw?

00:14:09.954 --> 00:14:12.082
You've been going around
with that grin lately.

00:14:12.165 --> 00:14:15.543
Why? Everyone keeps saying
something's off about me.

00:14:19.756 --> 00:14:20.840
See for yourself.

00:14:28.223 --> 00:14:30.225
Why on earth
are you walking around like that?

00:14:33.853 --> 00:14:35.146
The truth is,

00:14:35.855 --> 00:14:37.065
after this field trip,

00:14:38.233 --> 00:14:40.235
I'm going on a date for one day
with Ms. Bom.

00:14:42.362 --> 00:14:44.656
Just imagine going on a date with Se-jin.

00:14:44.739 --> 00:14:46.282
Could you stop smiling?

00:14:47.367 --> 00:14:48.493
Well, I get that.

00:14:50.328 --> 00:14:52.539
Ms. Bom might be turned off
if you act like this.

00:14:52.622 --> 00:14:54.249
Why would she get turned off?

00:14:57.419 --> 00:15:01.297
Se-jin's brother came to school today,
all dressed up in a suit.

00:15:02.048 --> 00:15:05.719
Even with all those people watching,
he stayed composed and spoke perfectly.

00:15:05.802 --> 00:15:09.013
Everyone in the auditorium was so moved
that they gave him a standing ovation.

00:15:09.097 --> 00:15:12.100
I have no plans for college,
yet I almost wanted to be a lawyer.

00:15:12.183 --> 00:15:13.268
What about Ms. Bom?

00:15:13.768 --> 00:15:15.353
Did she give a standing ovation too?

00:15:15.437 --> 00:15:16.938
She clapped the most.

00:15:23.486 --> 00:15:24.738
To be honest,

00:15:26.156 --> 00:15:29.284
you won't be an official couple
for another two years.

00:15:29.367 --> 00:15:32.287
Until then, she's free to date anyone.

00:15:33.121 --> 00:15:36.958
So stop acting silly
and tone down the grin.

00:15:37.584 --> 00:15:38.668
Got it?

00:15:41.171 --> 00:15:42.255
Got it.

00:15:43.965 --> 00:15:46.843
So your teacher gave a standing ovation
to Choi I-jun?

00:15:47.802 --> 00:15:49.596
Watch closely on this field trip.

00:15:49.679 --> 00:15:51.765
See how your teacher reacts.

00:15:51.848 --> 00:15:53.850
-Got it?
-Got it.

00:16:03.735 --> 00:16:04.694
Enjoy.

00:16:08.448 --> 00:16:11.201
You know Choi I-jun, the lawyer?

00:16:12.368 --> 00:16:13.953
He pointed right at me

00:16:15.163 --> 00:16:16.623
and said, "I'll be on your side."

00:16:17.248 --> 00:16:20.794
Suddenly, I could barely breathe,
and my heart started racing like crazy.

00:16:21.753 --> 00:16:25.173
I heard he and Sun Jae-gyu
are the same age.

00:16:25.256 --> 00:16:27.383
And yet, they're completely different.

00:16:27.467 --> 00:16:29.719
-Right? The other day...
-Yes.

00:16:29.803 --> 00:16:33.014
...did you see Sun Jae-gyu
acting out in handcuffs?

00:16:33.097 --> 00:16:35.725
How could women flock to that thief?

00:16:35.809 --> 00:16:37.060
I just don't get it.

00:16:41.439 --> 00:16:44.150
I should set a few things straight.

00:16:44.943 --> 00:16:47.237
Mr. Sun isn't a thief.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.822
He was trying to catch the thief.

00:16:48.905 --> 00:16:53.284
The woman you saw
isn't Mr. Sun's girlfriend.

00:16:53.368 --> 00:16:54.494
She's an insurance agent.

00:16:55.995 --> 00:16:57.038
An insurance agent?

00:16:57.705 --> 00:16:59.332
Come on, that's ridiculous.

00:16:59.415 --> 00:17:00.583
Mr. Wi, you saw them.

00:17:01.459 --> 00:17:03.336
The way they were looking at each other,

00:17:03.419 --> 00:17:06.214
did that look like an insurance agent
and a client to you?

00:17:06.297 --> 00:17:08.967
If I had to describe the look in her eyes,

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:11.886
it was like she was looking
at a priceless treasure.

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:13.304
Good observation.

00:17:14.347 --> 00:17:17.600
Once she sets her mind on a client,
there is no letting go.

00:17:17.684 --> 00:17:20.228
So she's known as
the Doberman of the insurance world.

00:17:21.229 --> 00:17:22.438
Is that so?

00:17:23.231 --> 00:17:24.440
That's great.

00:17:24.524 --> 00:17:27.861
My gums have been acting up,
so I was going to get dental insurance.

00:17:27.944 --> 00:17:30.238
When's that insurance agent coming again?

00:17:31.114 --> 00:17:33.575
I hate to break it to you,
but there's no way

00:17:33.658 --> 00:17:35.535
she'll ever be back in this area.

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:38.580
By the way, Ms. Bom,

00:17:39.455 --> 00:17:41.249
how did you know all that?

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:00.310
Look at the time.

00:18:01.394 --> 00:18:04.022
I have a field trip, so I better go.

00:18:05.273 --> 00:18:07.358
-Answer before you go.
-She knows everything.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.613
Ms. Bom, we'll go ahead.

00:18:11.696 --> 00:18:12.822
-Okay.
-See you in a bit.

00:18:12.906 --> 00:18:14.073
-See you soon.
-Okay.

00:18:16.576 --> 00:18:17.410
Ms. Bom!

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:20.288
Ms. Bom.

00:18:20.371 --> 00:18:22.707
Something's going on
with you and Sun Jae-gyu, right?

00:18:23.207 --> 00:18:24.542
Nothing's going on.

00:18:24.626 --> 00:18:26.336
My twins saw you the other day.

00:18:27.503 --> 00:18:28.546
Bom-sik!

00:18:34.886 --> 00:18:37.889
They saw him entering your place.

00:18:40.808 --> 00:18:43.519
I thought he was just a thug
with a dragon tattoo on his arm.

00:18:43.603 --> 00:18:45.939
But seeing him at the sports fest
and catching the thief,

00:18:46.022 --> 00:18:47.440
he's competitive and righteous.

00:18:47.523 --> 00:18:50.109
I realized he's not just a dumb guy.

00:18:50.193 --> 00:18:53.529
The more you're around him,
the more you want to stay close to him,

00:18:53.613 --> 00:18:55.156
am I right?

00:18:55.239 --> 00:18:57.367
He didn't come to my place
to get close to me.

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:01.371
Well, the dog I adopted
was rescued by him.

00:19:01.454 --> 00:19:02.789
So he came by to check in.

00:19:03.706 --> 00:19:06.626
You've been looking really pretty lately.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.505
You totally have that dating glow.

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:16.761
I hear you're going on a field trip
to where Han-gyul's uncle works.

00:19:17.971 --> 00:19:18.846
Ms. Seo.

00:19:19.472 --> 00:19:24.560
The purpose of our visit is strictly
for the Energy Club field trip...

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:29.107
Oh, the bus is here.

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:30.024
Well then...

00:19:34.487 --> 00:19:36.072
There's something going on.

00:19:39.367 --> 00:19:41.202
What if the students hear that at school?

00:19:41.828 --> 00:19:43.454
Pull yourself together, Yoon Bom.

00:19:43.538 --> 00:19:46.332
If the students find out, you're done for.

00:19:46.416 --> 00:19:49.419
When you see Mr. Sun today,
you need to be completely hostile

00:19:49.502 --> 00:19:51.004
and as cold as possible.

00:19:51.587 --> 00:19:54.674
Remember that feeling when
you first saw him with the chicken skewer.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.555
-Wow.
-Wow, it's so refreshing.

00:20:02.473 --> 00:20:03.808
I wish this land was mine.

00:20:03.891 --> 00:20:05.476
It's gigantic.

00:20:06.394 --> 00:20:07.645
Why is it so big?

00:20:07.729 --> 00:20:10.314
Wow, this place is insane.

00:20:10.398 --> 00:20:13.484
I don't see Mr. Sun here today.

00:20:14.318 --> 00:20:15.653
Oh, right.

00:20:16.612 --> 00:20:17.697
Him?

00:20:21.701 --> 00:20:24.704
This is Philip. Can you hear me?

00:20:24.787 --> 00:20:26.706
Current wind speed is fine.

00:21:00.907 --> 00:21:04.118
The nacelle's hooked up.
Rope's going down!

00:22:25.616 --> 00:22:26.826
All right.

00:22:28.911 --> 00:22:32.165
Welcome to our plant, Green Narae!

00:22:34.083 --> 00:22:37.336
Uncle, let me tell you something.
It was perfect.

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:40.548
Master, I thought
I was watching an action film.

00:22:40.631 --> 00:22:42.091
What you just saw wasn't a movie.

00:22:42.175 --> 00:22:45.219
These wind turbines make wind energy,

00:22:45.887 --> 00:22:50.141
and the blades are prone to damage
from airborne objects or birds.

00:22:50.224 --> 00:22:54.478
That's why our plant constantly monitors
and maintains the turbines

00:22:54.562 --> 00:22:56.147
both on the ground and in the air.

00:22:58.107 --> 00:23:00.943
Ms. Bom,
I've got a new dream starting today.

00:23:01.027 --> 00:23:04.071
It's not to marry an idol,
it's to join JQ Energy.

00:23:10.286 --> 00:23:12.246
What do you think, Ms. Bom?

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:13.956
Do you like the size of the company?

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:14.999
Well...

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.251
It's tall.

00:23:19.962 --> 00:23:21.130
"Tall..."

00:23:23.466 --> 00:23:24.926
Is that it?

00:23:25.009 --> 00:23:27.178
We can see the solar plant too, right?

00:23:28.804 --> 00:23:29.639
Sure.

00:23:32.308 --> 00:23:34.518
-Director Gu, escort them.
-Sure.

00:23:35.228 --> 00:23:36.312
-Follow me.
-Let's go.

00:23:36.395 --> 00:23:38.147
-This way.
-Go on.

00:23:47.823 --> 00:23:51.661
Shinsu Power Plant covers roughly
1,058,000 square meters.

00:23:51.744 --> 00:23:54.163
We have 82,000 modules here alone,

00:23:54.247 --> 00:23:58.251
and it generates
around 47 gigawatts per year.

00:23:58.334 --> 00:24:00.127
Currently, we own three power plants,

00:24:00.211 --> 00:24:02.338
including ones in Ulsan and Dangjin,

00:24:02.421 --> 00:24:05.424
and we're planning a wind farm in Taebaek.

00:24:05.508 --> 00:24:11.472
We're aiming to go public on KOSDAQ
within three years.

00:24:12.265 --> 00:24:13.849
No matter how big it is,

00:24:13.933 --> 00:24:15.601
the business model itself is limited,

00:24:15.685 --> 00:24:18.020
so it'd be hard to go public
without a unique factor.

00:24:20.523 --> 00:24:21.357
Choi Se-jin.

00:24:23.693 --> 00:24:25.069
That's a great question.

00:24:25.152 --> 00:24:26.946
To address those issues,

00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:30.574
our company invests
24% of our annual revenue in R&D

00:24:30.658 --> 00:24:34.870
and is developing technology to prevent
performance drops caused by pollution.

00:24:35.496 --> 00:24:37.665
Uncle, don't you need another nephew?

00:24:38.165 --> 00:24:39.917
If you want to adopt a kid, I'll cut ties

00:24:40.001 --> 00:24:41.460
with my twin brother right away.

00:24:43.087 --> 00:24:43.963
I'll pass.

00:24:44.672 --> 00:24:45.881
What do you think, Ms. Bom?

00:24:46.757 --> 00:24:48.217
Do you like the company's vision?

00:24:51.804 --> 00:24:52.638
Well...

00:24:53.681 --> 00:24:55.057
It's fine.

00:24:57.893 --> 00:25:00.104
Could we meet the CEO today?

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:04.608
Se-jin wants to learn more
about running a power plant.

00:25:06.736 --> 00:25:08.029
Director Gu!

00:25:08.112 --> 00:25:09.238
Escort them.

00:25:09.322 --> 00:25:10.906
Sure. Everyone, come this way.

00:25:11.615 --> 00:25:13.284
-Okay.
-Let's go.

00:25:27.715 --> 00:25:28.841
CEO'S OFFICE

00:25:28.924 --> 00:25:31.052
Sir, we're coming in.

00:25:55.326 --> 00:25:56.327
Hello.

00:25:56.911 --> 00:26:00.206
We're from the Green Narae Energy Club
at Shinsu High.

00:26:46.085 --> 00:26:49.380
CEO SUN JAE-GYU

00:26:51.132 --> 00:26:52.091
Hello.

00:26:52.842 --> 00:26:56.679
I'm Sun Jae-gyu, CEO of JQ Energy.

00:26:59.682 --> 00:27:00.599
Your uncle is...

00:27:02.768 --> 00:27:03.936
a CEO?

00:27:07.481 --> 00:27:08.482
That's right.

00:27:08.566 --> 00:27:12.069
The "J" stands for Jae,
and the "Q" stands for Gyu.

00:27:12.153 --> 00:27:15.948
I, Sun Jae-gyu, am the CEO of JQ Energy.

00:27:16.031 --> 00:27:19.952
Master, you totally look like
a Forbes cover model.

00:27:20.703 --> 00:27:23.289
Do you guys know what this fabric is?

00:27:25.249 --> 00:27:27.710
Perfect husband material!

00:27:29.545 --> 00:27:32.673
Honestly, my uncle
is the best husband material.

00:27:33.674 --> 00:27:35.718
He's strong, influential,

00:27:35.801 --> 00:27:37.761
-and rich.
-Oh, stop it.

00:27:40.764 --> 00:27:42.516
Well, what do you think, Ms. Bom?

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:45.436
Do you like the CEO of this company?

00:27:46.729 --> 00:27:48.355
Why do you keep asking me?

00:27:52.234 --> 00:27:53.819
Well...

00:27:54.862 --> 00:27:58.908
it seems you were quite shocked to hear
that I'm the CEO of this company.

00:27:58.991 --> 00:28:01.202
Yes, I was surprised. I did get surprised.

00:28:02.036 --> 00:28:04.914
That said, since Han-gyul's uncle
runs the company,

00:28:04.997 --> 00:28:08.417
I think we can ask more freely
about how the plant is run.

00:28:08.501 --> 00:28:09.710
Isn't that right, Se-jin?

00:28:09.793 --> 00:28:13.756
Ms. Bom, why do you keep
dragging me into this?

00:28:14.798 --> 00:28:17.635
The kids must be hungry.
When do we get dinner?

00:28:20.846 --> 00:28:22.264
Director Gu.

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:24.934
Escort them.

00:28:25.809 --> 00:28:27.728
Sure. Please, come this way.

00:28:51.544 --> 00:28:52.670
-Let's go!
-You scared me!

00:28:53.963 --> 00:28:56.298
Today, I'll do a live demo
of the armbar transition

00:28:56.382 --> 00:28:57.466
from knee-on-belly.

00:29:01.595 --> 00:29:04.682
Why are you putting lipstick on
when you're heading to work out?

00:29:05.558 --> 00:29:06.809
I'm not going to the dojo.

00:29:07.768 --> 00:29:11.063
You said watching me
was more fun than TV shows.

00:29:11.146 --> 00:29:12.064
Who are you meeting?

00:29:13.524 --> 00:29:15.693
Where are you off to in this nightgown?

00:29:15.776 --> 00:29:17.194
What's wrong with you?

00:29:21.782 --> 00:29:22.783
Is it that guy?

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:26.120
That jerk who got divorced, right?

00:29:27.079 --> 00:29:29.832
Why are you calling someone
you barely know "that jerk"?

00:29:30.916 --> 00:29:34.378
So he talks all smooth
in a Seoul accent while smiling at you.

00:29:34.461 --> 00:29:36.964
You think that means
he's into you or something?

00:29:37.715 --> 00:29:40.593
Men like that are so predictable.

00:29:40.676 --> 00:29:43.929
He's lonely away from home
and wants a woman to fool around with.

00:29:44.013 --> 00:29:45.222
That works out.

00:29:47.641 --> 00:29:49.476
I'm lonely too, so that works.

00:29:52.896 --> 00:29:54.189
This isn't it.

00:29:55.316 --> 00:29:57.318
Geez, what's wrong with her?

00:30:00.571 --> 00:30:03.157
I heard they're going
to an amusement park this weekend.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.658
An amusement park?

00:30:04.742 --> 00:30:05.743
Yes.

00:30:07.578 --> 00:30:11.582
Ms. Seo wouldn't fall for that, would she?

00:30:13.083 --> 00:30:13.959
A romance scam.

00:30:14.877 --> 00:30:15.919
What cam?

00:30:16.003 --> 00:30:17.630
Didn't you see on the news?

00:30:17.713 --> 00:30:20.257
They act interested
and pretend to love you

00:30:20.341 --> 00:30:23.052
just to get your personal info,
take your money, and then vanish.

00:30:23.135 --> 00:30:26.055
It's a scam that preys on lonely people.

00:30:37.566 --> 00:30:38.525
Anchovy spicy paste.

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:41.153
POCHEON-STYLE MARINATED GALBI

00:30:41.236 --> 00:30:43.572
Han-gyul, here's the galbi you mentioned.

00:30:48.285 --> 00:30:49.495
The meat looks really good.

00:30:49.578 --> 00:30:51.163
The color's great. Bring it over.

00:31:03.008 --> 00:31:04.510
Hey, Han-gyul.

00:31:04.593 --> 00:31:06.720
Was the field trip underwhelming today?

00:31:07.346 --> 00:31:09.223
Not at all. It was amazing.

00:31:14.186 --> 00:31:16.438
But why has your teacher
been cold and distant all day?

00:31:23.237 --> 00:31:24.113
Go on, hurry.

00:31:26.156 --> 00:31:27.032
Where's she going?

00:31:28.826 --> 00:31:29.702
Philip.

00:31:57.688 --> 00:31:58.522
What?

00:31:59.356 --> 00:32:00.190
What are you doing?

00:32:00.274 --> 00:32:01.567
We want some too.

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:03.652
Why are you giving
all the galbi to Se-jin?

00:32:06.447 --> 00:32:07.406
That's...

00:32:15.581 --> 00:32:18.917
because it's the best cut, so I gave it
to the person I care about the most.

00:32:26.008 --> 00:32:26.842
Eat up.

00:32:28.385 --> 00:32:29.887
I meant to give you a gift myself.

00:32:40.105 --> 00:32:42.441
I don't think I need your help anymore.

00:32:42.524 --> 00:32:44.193
I've found an amazing tutor.

00:32:47.654 --> 00:32:49.323
I'll pass on this too.

00:32:49.406 --> 00:32:50.908
I'm on a diet.

00:32:53.619 --> 00:32:54.661
Eat up.

00:33:00.501 --> 00:33:02.669
Wow, see how juicy it is?

00:33:02.753 --> 00:33:03.754
It's incredible.

00:33:03.837 --> 00:33:06.381
How come Se-jin won't eat
something this tasty?

00:33:06.465 --> 00:33:08.175
Guys, she gave it to me.

00:33:09.468 --> 00:33:10.427
This is amazing.

00:33:10.511 --> 00:33:13.013
You can eat it too. Go ahead and eat.

00:33:18.143 --> 00:33:19.561
What's wrong with you, Yoon Bom?

00:33:20.145 --> 00:33:23.148
You should be hostile.
Why can't you take your eyes off him?

00:33:25.275 --> 00:33:28.278
Wait, I didn't look because I wanted to.

00:33:28.362 --> 00:33:30.906
How can I ignore those veins
popping under his shirt?

00:33:31.532 --> 00:33:34.451
How could anyone ignore
his forearms flexing while grilling?

00:33:34.535 --> 00:33:35.953
-Ms. Bom.
-What?

00:33:38.747 --> 00:33:40.123
Why did you come here?

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.044
Did something bother you today?

00:33:44.127 --> 00:33:45.003
No, that's not it.

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:47.798
Earlier today,

00:33:48.423 --> 00:33:51.552
Ms. Seo asked me about our relationship.
Did you know that?

00:33:53.095 --> 00:33:55.305
Han-gyul seems
to have noticed something too.

00:33:55.389 --> 00:33:57.432
And the twins talked
about husband material.

00:33:57.516 --> 00:33:59.935
Who cares what the twins say?

00:34:00.018 --> 00:34:02.020
The kids are simply enjoying the meat.

00:34:03.689 --> 00:34:04.940
This isn't going to work.

00:34:06.275 --> 00:34:10.112
Let's just call off our date.

00:34:14.616 --> 00:34:15.534
Ms. Bom.

00:34:18.287 --> 00:34:21.498
Do you realize how cruel
what you just said is to me?

00:34:23.208 --> 00:34:24.793
I've been waiting for that day,

00:34:24.877 --> 00:34:28.630
trying not to smile every day.
I feel like my face is going to cramp up.

00:34:28.714 --> 00:34:30.883
What are we going to do if we get caught?

00:34:32.634 --> 00:34:35.888
I'll do my best to plan the route
so you don't have to worry.

00:34:35.971 --> 00:34:37.139
Even so--

00:34:37.222 --> 00:34:39.558
I'll find the perfect spot
so we don't run into anyone

00:34:40.225 --> 00:34:41.476
and no one gets suspicious.

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:43.312
-Mr. Sun.
-Ms. Bom.

00:34:44.313 --> 00:34:45.188
You trust me, right?

00:34:46.189 --> 00:34:49.109
Tomorrow,
I'll go pick you up at your place.

00:34:55.198 --> 00:34:57.409
Gosh, I almost got butterflies again.

00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:03.332
Were you that excited
to be late for tutoring?

00:35:04.541 --> 00:35:08.712
When a guy gives a woman meat,
isn't that basically a proposal?

00:35:10.172 --> 00:35:12.049
-What kind of meat?
-Pocheon galbi.

00:35:14.092 --> 00:35:15.510
What will you name your grandson?

00:35:19.264 --> 00:35:21.183
Seriously, he's a player.

00:35:21.266 --> 00:35:23.477
If he doesn't like me,
why's he being so nice?

00:35:24.353 --> 00:35:25.520
Who's so nice to you?

00:35:27.314 --> 00:35:31.360
Jjun, I'm not the type to fall for a guy
just because he's popular

00:35:31.443 --> 00:35:33.111
with all the girls.

00:35:33.737 --> 00:35:35.739
I'm not the type to be swayed
by cheap niceties

00:35:35.822 --> 00:35:38.075
or bribed with meat.

00:35:39.368 --> 00:35:40.786
Is this the crush denial period?

00:35:42.579 --> 00:35:43.664
Me?

00:35:44.289 --> 00:35:45.415
I'm Choi Se-jin, though.

00:35:46.375 --> 00:35:47.250
Se-jin.

00:35:48.085 --> 00:35:50.587
I'm fine with anyone you date,

00:35:51.296 --> 00:35:52.589
but before that,

00:35:53.715 --> 00:35:55.050
let's beat Sun Han-gyul first.

00:35:55.133 --> 00:35:58.679
Sorry, but I'm a bit confused right now.

00:35:58.762 --> 00:36:01.181
So maybe you should take down
Han-gyul's uncle first.

00:36:01.848 --> 00:36:04.017
You should forget about that boy's face

00:36:04.643 --> 00:36:06.103
and just picture Sun Han-gyul.

00:36:07.312 --> 00:36:09.064
I'll make sure you get a Grade 1

00:36:09.648 --> 00:36:13.193
on your report card this final.

00:36:15.445 --> 00:36:17.739
Let's go to page 136.

00:36:17.823 --> 00:36:21.243
You need to use the first term
and the common difference.

00:36:21.326 --> 00:36:25.956
But it's a lot faster and easier
if you use the arithmetic mean.

00:36:26.915 --> 00:36:27.958
Ms. Bom!

00:36:29.084 --> 00:36:30.043
Ms. Bom!

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:39.094
Get in.

00:36:40.345 --> 00:36:41.430
What time is it?

00:36:42.014 --> 00:36:42.848
It's 4:30 a.m.

00:36:44.141 --> 00:36:45.183
It's 4:30 a.m.?

00:36:45.267 --> 00:36:47.227
After midnight,
it counts as that day, right?

00:36:48.103 --> 00:36:50.731
Even so, the sun hasn't risen,

00:36:51.356 --> 00:36:52.858
and I haven't even washed up yet.

00:36:57.988 --> 00:36:58.864
Really?

00:37:00.365 --> 00:37:03.952
You're this pretty without washing up.
If you do, I'll need to go plow again.

00:37:07.205 --> 00:37:09.583
Where are we going this early?

00:37:12.461 --> 00:37:13.962
The first thing on our schedule...

00:37:20.385 --> 00:37:21.261
is the sunrise.

00:37:22.095 --> 00:37:25.682
I picked a time and place
where we won't run into anyone,

00:37:25.766 --> 00:37:27.684
so you don't have to worry.

00:37:29.186 --> 00:37:30.020
You're right.

00:37:31.063 --> 00:37:32.064
There's no one around.

00:37:32.147 --> 00:37:34.232
I told you to trust me.

00:37:34.316 --> 00:37:37.277
Here, I've packed some food.

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.737
Help yourself if you're hungry.

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:40.906
Cover up with this if you're cold.

00:37:42.699 --> 00:37:43.992
So chilly. Gosh, it's chilly.

00:38:23.281 --> 00:38:26.743
-One, two.
-One, two.

00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:29.830
Dong-pyo. Mr. Wi.

00:38:29.913 --> 00:38:30.831
Mr. Wi?

00:38:31.373 --> 00:38:34.167
-One, two.
-One, two.

00:38:34.251 --> 00:38:35.919
Oh, that's Master.

00:38:36.795 --> 00:38:39.798
-One, two.
-One, two.

00:38:39.881 --> 00:38:41.591
-One, two.
-One, two.

00:38:41.675 --> 00:38:44.302
Master. What are you doing here alone?

00:38:45.428 --> 00:38:46.304
Hey.

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:49.099
-I came to see the sunrise.
-By yourself?

00:38:49.182 --> 00:38:52.477
Don't you know I'm an introvert?

00:38:52.561 --> 00:38:54.729
Come on, let's run together.

00:38:54.813 --> 00:38:57.107
I'll pass.
I need some time alone to think.

00:38:57.732 --> 00:38:59.151
You guys go on.

00:38:59.234 --> 00:39:00.902
Okay, then, turn around!

00:39:00.986 --> 00:39:04.322
-One, two.
-One, two.

00:39:06.825 --> 00:39:07.826
They're gone.

00:39:09.411 --> 00:39:11.037
-Come on out.
-Are they gone?

00:39:11.121 --> 00:39:13.290
-One, two.
-Turn around!

00:39:13.373 --> 00:39:15.333
-One, two.
-But they're coming back.

00:39:15.417 --> 00:39:18.378
-One, two.
-One, two.

00:39:18.461 --> 00:39:19.588
Master!

00:39:19.671 --> 00:39:21.381
Why are you coming here? Go!

00:39:21.464 --> 00:39:22.549
Take a break!

00:39:23.466 --> 00:39:25.760
We thought you might be lonely,

00:39:25.844 --> 00:39:29.556
so we decided to stop running
and watch the sunrise with you.

00:39:32.309 --> 00:39:33.185
Why are you guys...

00:39:34.728 --> 00:39:36.313
so awfully thoughtful?

00:39:40.609 --> 00:39:41.651
Goodness, my legs.

00:39:48.825 --> 00:39:51.244
What's wrong? Is everything okay?

00:39:51.912 --> 00:39:52.996
It's nothing.

00:39:53.079 --> 00:39:56.625
I didn't sleep well last night,
so my breathing is a little unsteady.

00:40:01.504 --> 00:40:02.797
By the way,

00:40:04.132 --> 00:40:05.467
what's this?

00:40:07.469 --> 00:40:09.137
-Isn't this food?
-No, it's not.

00:40:09.221 --> 00:40:11.973
I've been feeling hungry. Can I try one?

00:40:12.057 --> 00:40:13.016
There's no food!

00:40:13.099 --> 00:40:14.851
-Open it.
-No, it's not!

00:40:14.935 --> 00:40:15.810
Open it.

00:40:20.148 --> 00:40:21.274
-Let's eat.
-Yeah.

00:40:22.651 --> 00:40:23.985
It's to die for.

00:40:24.819 --> 00:40:26.238
It's so good.

00:40:27.739 --> 00:40:28.782
I...

00:40:30.492 --> 00:40:32.661
stayed up all night
cooking and preparing this.

00:40:39.417 --> 00:40:40.418
Sorry about this.

00:40:49.302 --> 00:40:50.845
What do I do?

00:40:51.638 --> 00:40:53.098
Sorry I made you go through that.

00:40:54.474 --> 00:40:55.809
Are you sure no one saw me?

00:40:55.892 --> 00:40:57.978
They didn't see anything but the blanket.

00:40:58.979 --> 00:41:03.483
By the way,
they ate up all the food I packed for you.

00:41:04.776 --> 00:41:06.444
Who cares about food right now?

00:41:06.528 --> 00:41:07.362
I do.

00:41:08.154 --> 00:41:10.323
It's our first date,
so you've got to eat well.

00:41:11.783 --> 00:41:12.867
Hop in.

00:41:18.206 --> 00:41:19.499
Watch your step.

00:41:19.582 --> 00:41:21.710
What restaurant could be out
in these mountains?

00:41:21.793 --> 00:41:27.424
This gukbap place
is a hidden gem I found recently.

00:41:27.507 --> 00:41:30.802
I've never once run into
anyone from Shinsu here.

00:41:31.428 --> 00:41:33.179
Let's head in.

00:41:33.263 --> 00:41:34.139
Watch your step.

00:41:35.682 --> 00:41:37.350
This is Shinsu's Michelin-rated place.

00:41:37.434 --> 00:41:39.769
I've never run into
a single person from Shinsu--

00:41:41.104 --> 00:41:42.063
Ms. Bom.

00:41:43.773 --> 00:41:45.191
Principal!

00:41:48.695 --> 00:41:52.699
Did you two come together?

00:41:54.075 --> 00:41:55.618
Oh, my. Han-gyul's uncle.

00:41:56.328 --> 00:41:57.162
Ms. Bom.

00:41:57.746 --> 00:41:58.955
What brings you here?

00:42:00.081 --> 00:42:02.584
I guess you like gukbap.

00:42:03.168 --> 00:42:06.963
Yes, they call me
"the Minister of Gukbap."

00:42:07.047 --> 00:42:10.342
Gukbap has been with me
throughout my life.

00:42:10.967 --> 00:42:11.926
It's my comfort food.

00:42:14.346 --> 00:42:15.680
I see.

00:42:16.639 --> 00:42:19.309
Principal, what are you doing here
at this hour?

00:42:19.976 --> 00:42:21.353
What? Oh, yes.

00:42:21.936 --> 00:42:25.065
It's our anniversary today.

00:42:27.233 --> 00:42:29.861
Wait, gukbap on your anniversary,

00:42:29.944 --> 00:42:31.821
especially at 7:20 in the morning?

00:42:31.905 --> 00:42:33.990
We're morning people.

00:42:34.074 --> 00:42:38.995
On top of that, this place
is a hidden gem only we know.

00:42:39.079 --> 00:42:43.500
It's where we had our first date
32 years ago.

00:42:44.084 --> 00:42:45.001
I see.

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:51.549
So this place has been
a hidden gem for 32 years?

00:42:52.092 --> 00:42:54.719
Happy anniversary to you both.

00:42:54.803 --> 00:42:57.472
Oh, thank you very much.

00:42:57.555 --> 00:42:59.015
Can I get gukbap here?

00:42:59.099 --> 00:43:00.016
Sure.

00:43:14.447 --> 00:43:15.782
That was so scary, right?

00:43:18.618 --> 00:43:19.786
Do I look okay?

00:43:19.869 --> 00:43:22.372
Of course. You look beautiful.

00:43:22.455 --> 00:43:23.581
Wait, Hye-suk, your hair.

00:43:24.707 --> 00:43:26.292
-Let's go.
-Geez.

00:43:26.376 --> 00:43:28.753
Look at her flirting in that skirt.

00:43:28.837 --> 00:43:29.879
This is so fun.

00:43:30.713 --> 00:43:32.632
She's having the time of her life.

00:43:34.217 --> 00:43:35.552
-Hye-suk.
-Yes?

00:43:35.635 --> 00:43:37.971
It's hot. Shall we get some ice cream?

00:43:38.054 --> 00:43:39.013
-Shall we?
-Yes.

00:43:40.473 --> 00:43:41.349
I'll have chocolate.

00:43:43.184 --> 00:43:45.770
Right, hello.

00:43:45.854 --> 00:43:48.731
Two chocolates in cups, please.

00:43:49.649 --> 00:43:51.776
Why are you so quick to pay?
Have some manners.

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:54.571
Mr. Jeong, what are you doing here?

00:43:54.654 --> 00:43:55.822
You, take out your wallet.

00:43:56.614 --> 00:43:57.657
What's wrong with you?

00:43:57.740 --> 00:43:59.200
I said, take out your wallet.

00:43:59.284 --> 00:44:00.243
Unbelievable.

00:44:01.744 --> 00:44:02.871
Here.

00:44:05.915 --> 00:44:07.584
Geez, what the hell?

00:44:13.923 --> 00:44:15.842
What is wrong with him?

00:44:17.135 --> 00:44:20.263
Don't they sell anything sharper
than cotton candy here?

00:44:21.139 --> 00:44:22.724
I swear, I'm going to kill him.

00:44:23.808 --> 00:44:24.642
Ms. Seo!

00:44:29.439 --> 00:44:30.690
Why'd you come to this town?

00:44:31.441 --> 00:44:33.735
I'm here for work, obviously.

00:44:34.402 --> 00:44:36.362
Then just do your job and leave.

00:44:36.446 --> 00:44:38.281
Why are you hitting on a single mom?

00:44:38.364 --> 00:44:39.991
Hitting on her?

00:44:40.074 --> 00:44:42.660
In Seoul,
this is what we call a "situationship."

00:44:43.953 --> 00:44:45.497
A "situationship"?

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:47.081
Darn it.

00:44:47.165 --> 00:44:48.541
Why are you doing this?

00:44:48.625 --> 00:44:50.210
You better not be lying,

00:44:50.752 --> 00:44:53.213
or this will turn into
a whole different "situation."

00:44:53.296 --> 00:44:54.631
Understand? Believe it or not,

00:44:55.215 --> 00:44:58.593
I'm the one and only PE teacher
at Shinsu High.

00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:01.179
Hye-suk!

00:45:01.262 --> 00:45:02.847
-Hye-suk!
-Keep it down.

00:45:04.974 --> 00:45:07.769
Gosh, he's driving me crazy.
What's gotten into him?

00:45:18.363 --> 00:45:19.989
Maybe it's the nice weather.

00:45:20.073 --> 00:45:21.783
It's unusually crowded here today.

00:45:22.867 --> 00:45:25.078
This won't do, let's go somewhere else.

00:45:28.289 --> 00:45:29.874
What's going on today?

00:45:43.346 --> 00:45:44.305
You see,

00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:48.560
wouldn't it be safer
to be surrounded by a crowd

00:45:48.643 --> 00:45:51.187
than a restaurant
with just a few tables like before?

00:45:51.771 --> 00:45:53.189
And finals are coming up soon,

00:45:53.273 --> 00:45:55.525
so there's no way students
or teachers would come.

00:46:16.212 --> 00:46:17.171
What the heck?

00:46:18.339 --> 00:46:19.424
Wait, where did they go?

00:46:19.507 --> 00:46:21.968
Gosh, I'm still holding her purse.
Darn it.

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:30.226
Do we have to try this?

00:46:31.853 --> 00:46:34.856
Ms. Bom.
Let's just do this one thing and leave.

00:46:34.939 --> 00:46:35.815
You know what?

00:46:36.316 --> 00:46:39.277
I've always wanted to go
to an amusement park with my boyfriend...

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:40.820
Let's go in there.

00:46:40.903 --> 00:46:41.946
Let's go...

00:46:42.947 --> 00:46:44.157
Hye-suk.

00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:48.119
Ms. Seo. There's Ms. Seo!

00:46:52.081 --> 00:46:53.041
Busted.

00:46:57.879 --> 00:46:59.005
Hye-suk.

00:46:59.505 --> 00:47:01.215
I can't handle this with my weak heart.

00:47:01.966 --> 00:47:04.802
Wait, Hye-suk! Can't we not go in here?

00:47:07.597 --> 00:47:08.681
Darn it.

00:47:17.857 --> 00:47:19.317
What do we do? There...

00:47:21.444 --> 00:47:22.820
Release my grudges!

00:47:22.904 --> 00:47:24.030
No.

00:47:33.331 --> 00:47:34.290
Get out of the way.

00:47:42.465 --> 00:47:44.300
-Come in here.
-What?

00:47:44.967 --> 00:47:47.136
We should hide from Ms. Seo. Hurry.

00:47:58.439 --> 00:47:59.440
Ms. Bom.

00:48:00.066 --> 00:48:02.694
I know you're in here. I already saw you.

00:48:03.444 --> 00:48:04.862
-Where are you?
-Hye-suk.

00:48:05.488 --> 00:48:07.240
I don't think we should go here.

00:48:15.206 --> 00:48:16.124
Ms. Bom.

00:48:17.208 --> 00:48:18.209
Ms. Bom, where are you?

00:48:18.292 --> 00:48:20.169
Hye-suk, why are you looking for Ms. Bom?

00:48:30.763 --> 00:48:32.265
Ms. Bom.

00:48:32.348 --> 00:48:34.350
I know you're in here.

00:48:44.736 --> 00:48:46.154
Ms. Bom.

00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:51.534
Who are you?

00:48:51.617 --> 00:48:52.910
Release my grudges!

00:48:52.994 --> 00:48:56.080
Yes, right in there. Ms. Bom!

00:48:56.164 --> 00:48:57.331
Ms. Bom!

00:49:44.921 --> 00:49:45.797
Sun Han-gyul?

00:50:08.736 --> 00:50:10.655
I think we've done plenty for a date.

00:50:11.948 --> 00:50:13.282
Shall we head home now?

00:50:15.743 --> 00:50:16.953
Still, it's our first date.

00:50:17.912 --> 00:50:21.415
We didn't catch the sunrise
or enjoy a good restaurant.

00:50:23.793 --> 00:50:26.254
It's not like it was totally unexpected.

00:50:28.965 --> 00:50:33.219
I do wish we'd had
that amusement park date, just a little.

00:50:36.514 --> 00:50:38.140
You really wanted to go on the rides?

00:50:40.434 --> 00:50:45.898
I just wanted a normal,
typical date like everyone else.

00:50:49.777 --> 00:50:51.571
If that's what you want, we should do it.

00:50:53.531 --> 00:50:55.157
Yeah, come with me.

00:51:04.542 --> 00:51:06.127
Hop out.

00:51:10.298 --> 00:51:12.675
Welcome to Jae-gyu Land!

00:51:12.758 --> 00:51:14.468
What is this place?

00:51:14.552 --> 00:51:16.178
It's a closed-down elementary school.

00:51:16.262 --> 00:51:17.763
The playground's seen better days.

00:51:19.599 --> 00:51:22.518
Anyone who wants to go
on the Viking, come over here.

00:51:22.602 --> 00:51:23.436
Hey, you there.

00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:26.564
Hey, beautiful lady.
Aren't you going to ride the Viking?

00:51:26.647 --> 00:51:28.274
-Come on, quick.
-Okay.

00:51:28.774 --> 00:51:30.693
It's free.

00:51:32.111 --> 00:51:33.112
All right.

00:51:33.946 --> 00:51:36.032
Hold on to the safety bar.

00:51:37.617 --> 00:51:38.534
Here we go.

00:51:49.754 --> 00:51:51.672
Want me to go a little slower?

00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:53.507
No, go faster!

00:51:53.591 --> 00:51:54.967
-Faster?
-Yes.

00:51:55.051 --> 00:51:57.094
Okay! Hey, lady.

00:51:57.178 --> 00:51:58.596
There's no one around here.

00:51:58.679 --> 00:51:59.972
If you felt frustrated today,

00:52:00.056 --> 00:52:02.308
scream as much as you want, okay?

00:52:02.391 --> 00:52:03.225
Okay.

00:52:03.768 --> 00:52:04.727
Here we go!

00:52:29.001 --> 00:52:31.754
Hold on tight, or you'll fly off.

00:52:31.837 --> 00:52:32.964
Here we go!

00:53:10.918 --> 00:53:12.461
It's closing time.

00:53:12.962 --> 00:53:13.796
No way.

00:53:17.049 --> 00:53:18.718
Has it gotten this late already?

00:53:20.094 --> 00:53:22.054
Let's say goodbye here.

00:53:24.265 --> 00:53:26.142
Here, now?

00:53:31.689 --> 00:53:34.066
I have one last thing
I want to say to you.

00:53:34.734 --> 00:53:36.444
Can I just tell you three things?

00:53:37.069 --> 00:53:39.530
You see,
I don't care for getting all romantic--

00:53:39.613 --> 00:53:41.407
An average woman's BMR is 1,300 calories.

00:53:41.490 --> 00:53:44.577
Make sure to balance
your carbs, protein, and fat

00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:48.622
in a 5-3-2 ratio
based on your total calorie intake.

00:53:51.375 --> 00:53:53.794
Once it's past midnight,
you won't see me for two years.

00:53:53.878 --> 00:53:55.755
You're talking
about carbs, protein, and fat?

00:53:56.422 --> 00:53:58.841
I'm saying, eat well
even when you're alone.

00:53:59.550 --> 00:54:02.553
Take care of yourself
until the day we meet again.

00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:05.681
What about the second thing?

00:54:07.183 --> 00:54:10.561
There's bound to be at least one person
you feel like you want to kill.

00:54:10.644 --> 00:54:12.229
When that happens,

00:54:12.313 --> 00:54:15.441
just text me their name.

00:54:15.524 --> 00:54:16.734
Are you going to kill them?

00:54:16.817 --> 00:54:18.569
I'll scare them half to death.

00:54:19.278 --> 00:54:20.988
Whoever gives you a hard time,

00:54:21.072 --> 00:54:23.407
don't forget that
I won't let them get away with it.

00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:27.661
Hold your head high
and don't let anyone intimidate you.

00:54:29.330 --> 00:54:30.915
What's the last thing?

00:54:38.714 --> 00:54:39.632
Here.

00:54:45.012 --> 00:54:47.264
If one day, out of the blue,

00:54:48.724 --> 00:54:52.186
you ever find yourself really missing me,
open it then.

00:54:56.273 --> 00:54:57.358
I will.

00:54:59.777 --> 00:55:02.404
Is there anything you want to tell me?

00:55:05.241 --> 00:55:06.742
I'll say three things too.

00:55:09.745 --> 00:55:10.579
First,

00:55:12.623 --> 00:55:14.375
learn to be a little more cowardly.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.419
Don't jump into others' troubles
and end up in handcuffs.

00:55:17.962 --> 00:55:19.588
When you see injustice, hold back.

00:55:19.672 --> 00:55:21.173
Hold your tongue.

00:55:21.841 --> 00:55:22.675
Okay?

00:55:23.968 --> 00:55:25.177
I'll keep that in mind.

00:55:27.930 --> 00:55:28.889
For the second one...

00:55:36.814 --> 00:55:38.649
Don't wear a suit in front of other women.

00:55:40.151 --> 00:55:41.360
Why a suit...

00:55:45.781 --> 00:55:46.866
I won't.

00:55:47.491 --> 00:55:51.328
I'll put my suit in the closet
until the day I see you again,

00:55:52.037 --> 00:55:53.247
and then I'll wear it.

00:55:55.791 --> 00:55:56.834
What's the last one?

00:56:01.589 --> 00:56:02.631
Nothing.

00:56:04.049 --> 00:56:04.884
There isn't one?

00:56:06.844 --> 00:56:09.180
The last one is pointless anyway.

00:56:12.766 --> 00:56:13.726
I'll go, then.

00:56:14.810 --> 00:56:17.605
Are we really... saying goodbye here?

00:56:20.065 --> 00:56:20.941
Goodbye.

00:56:23.652 --> 00:56:24.862
Okay. Take care, Ms. Bom.

00:56:26.447 --> 00:56:27.448
No.

00:56:27.531 --> 00:56:30.910
I guess I need to change
how I address you now, right?

00:56:35.206 --> 00:56:38.709
Well then, goodbye, Ms. Yoon Bom.

00:56:40.711 --> 00:56:42.129
Take care,

00:56:43.631 --> 00:56:44.757
Han-gyul's uncle.

00:57:21.794 --> 00:57:22.836
Mr. Sun.

00:57:24.755 --> 00:57:25.839
Yes, Ms. Bom.

00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:28.342
There's still 20 seconds left.

00:57:29.051 --> 00:57:32.012
Can I say what I couldn't earlier?

00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:34.265
Sure.

00:57:35.266 --> 00:57:36.225
What is it?

00:57:38.269 --> 00:57:39.436
Can you...

00:57:40.729 --> 00:57:41.897
give me...

00:57:46.485 --> 00:57:47.778
one last hug?

00:58:03.627 --> 00:58:05.713
DANGER
KEEP OUT

00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:55.114
Are you crying, Mr. Sun?

00:59:55.197 --> 00:59:58.117
Now that you know I'm okay, stop crying.

00:59:58.200 --> 00:59:59.993
Is there someone you're into?

01:00:02.538 --> 01:00:04.331
His uncle... got knocked down?

01:00:04.415 --> 01:00:06.291
Did Jae-gyu say I came to sell insurance?

01:00:06.375 --> 01:00:07.668
That's impressive.

01:00:07.751 --> 01:00:10.712
I just ran into that woman,
so tell me the truth.

01:00:10.796 --> 01:00:12.840
-Were you with Ms. Bom?
-She came to my office.

01:00:12.923 --> 01:00:15.092
Forget that. Where is she right now?

01:00:15.175 --> 01:00:16.260
Ms. Bom!

01:00:17.261 --> 01:00:18.345
Ms. Bom!

01:00:25.227 --> 01:00:27.229
