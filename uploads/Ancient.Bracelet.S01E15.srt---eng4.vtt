00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.720
Zhaoli,

00:00:49.386 --> 00:00:50.583
something's wrong with Yan Che.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:51.920
You must not marry him.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.550
Zhaoli.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.910
Ying Du,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.070
shame on you.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.710
How could you drug me?

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.420
(Everlasting Joy)

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.120
Your Highness,

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.840
the ruler brought back a young woman.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.170
From the sound of it,

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.870
they share a very close bond.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:13.430
Find out

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.150
who she is.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.350
Yes.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.700
(Everlasting Joy)

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.400
Did you rest well last night?

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.150
I haven't slept all night,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.510
and I'm very exhausted.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.070
Finish what you came to say.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.920
I'll need a bit of rest after.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.120
Your Majesty,

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.590
don't push your luck.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.630
Stop pretending.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.790
Do it.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.710
If you mean to take my life,

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.590
why humiliate me like this?

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.840
(Yan Che's true identity)

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:04.113
(and his purpose for approaching
Zhaoli remain unknown.)

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.790
(It's not yet time to deal with him.)

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.000
Your Majesty,

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.000
please return my wife to me.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.630
You dare demand someone from me?

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.630
You've got quite the courage.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.190
For Zhaoli,

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.120
I'd willingly face death.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.150
You use sweet words like these

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.870
to deceive Zhaoli, right?

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.430
You'd better

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.280
keep up this act
for the rest of your life.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.150
Why look at me like that?

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.150
You know very well

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.840
what you've done to me.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.640
You heartless creature.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.470
What did I do to you?

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.000
You should ask what you did to me.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.280
How could you drug me?

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.360
If I desired you,

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.280
I'd never stoop to such means.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.400
It's so hot.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.240
I feel awful.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.080
Zhaoli,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.920
what are you doing?

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.960
Zhaoli,

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.590
you've been poisoned.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.960
We must purge the poison at once.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.600
Don't move.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:53.710
Let me cleanse the poison.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:00.750
Zhaoli,

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.310
calm yourself.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.710
That's the truth of what happened.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.080
You were poisoned.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.840
Everything you saw was just an illusion.

00:04:12.166 --> 00:04:13.360
But if you insist on believing

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.750
that I've done something to you,

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.990
so be it.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.480
Then why have you tied me up?

00:04:20.872 --> 00:04:22.099
I feared you might lose control

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.080
toward me.

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.480
You're pretending to be all noble now?

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.480
Since you claim to be so righteous,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.720
why did you drag me here by force?

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.750
I want you to marry me.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.510
Keep dreaming.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.360
At this point,

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.750
whether you wish it or not,

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.430
you will be.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.920
This wedding robe was made just for you.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:51.350
Try it on.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.430
I'll never wear it.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.430
Then you don't have to.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.560
I'll simply announce it to the world.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.190
What exactly are you planning?

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.510
Whatever Yan Che can give you,

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.430
I will give you far more.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.800
I won't let you suffer any grievance.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:14.710
Your Highness,

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:15.720
I know I was wrong.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.120
You drugged her?

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.950
I didn't want Che

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.120
to marry her.

00:05:27.321 --> 00:05:28.425
But I never imagined the one

00:05:28.436 --> 00:05:30.686
who spent that night with her
would be the ruler.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.110
Your Highness,

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.720
please, help me.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:35.600
Do not worry.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.430
I will protect you.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.630
So, you know who that woman is.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.360
She's just a humble healer
from our Wuyue tribe.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.830
Since you know her so well,

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.070
do something for me.

00:05:49.296 --> 00:05:51.000
(Everlasting Joy)
This is a family banquet.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.950
Members of the Wuyue tribe,
please feel at ease.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:53.800
A family banquet?

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.070
But we share

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.630
no marriage ties with the ruler.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.240
Does he seek alliance through marriage?

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.600
Ying Du, have you caused enough trouble?

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.910
Trouble?

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.070
I never waste time on trifles.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.350
Here, open your mouth.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.960
Not going to eat?

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.680
Shall I give it
to your grandmother instead?

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.960
Don't rush.

00:06:27.343 --> 00:06:28.270
If you're still hungry,

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.920
I'll feed you more in the bedchamber.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.120
You've never shown interest in women.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:34.950
I wonder which young lady

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.440
is worthy to stand by your side.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.870
The one beside me

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.830
is naturally my wife.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:43.590
Your wife?

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.560
You're not married.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.700
Nor do you keep any consorts.

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.240
Who exactly is she?

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.090
What now?

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.240
Must I report it to you

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.000
before I get married?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.190
I am merely curious.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.920
Besides, by doing so,

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.920
you're breaking the rules.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:00.780
So what?

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:01.660
Indeed.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.120
It is against protocol.

00:07:03.232 --> 00:07:04.569
Have you caused enough of a scene?

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.390
How long do you intend to disgrace me?

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.830
Please reveal

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:12.750
her identity.

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:15.360
Let go of me!

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.480
(Why hasn't the wound)

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.070
(healed yet?)

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:23.630
It seems

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.190
she hasn't grown used to her title.

00:07:25.533 --> 00:07:26.440
Since that's the case,

00:07:26.473 --> 00:07:28.040
there's no need for you all to meet her.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.240
All you need to know today

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.310
is that I've taken a wife.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:36.960
Your Majesty,

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.750
why bother hiding it?

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:40.830
Others may not see it clearly,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.750
but I can see it plain as day.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.040
Your wife

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.630
is just Zhaoli.

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:46.480
Zhaoli?

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:48.083
Didn't she marry the future chief?

00:07:48.094 --> 00:07:49.310
How could she marry the ruler?

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.160
- That's right!
- Is she really Zhaoli?

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.623
What's going on here?

00:07:52.755 --> 00:07:53.856
Zhaoli and the future chief

00:07:53.867 --> 00:07:55.265
have been betrothed since childhood.

00:07:55.276 --> 00:07:56.630
Why would she approach the ruler?

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.430
She's chasing wealth and status.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.070
Does she not see her own place?

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:01.310
You are Wu Luoluo?

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.450
Yes.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.766
Slandering my wife without reason

00:08:03.853 --> 00:08:05.040
is treated as a grave offense.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.480
Guards, take her away to the dungeon.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.480
- Yes.
- Your Majesty,

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.750
what did I say that was wrong?

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:11.183
Wu Zhaoli is unfaithful.

00:08:11.194 --> 00:08:12.510
She's unworthy of being your wife.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:13.350
Move.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:14.960
Let me go!

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:18.070
If it truly is Zhaoli,

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.750
please stop making mistakes.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.640
Yan Che,

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.310
if you don't dare to show

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:25.160
those thoughts in your heart,

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:27.040
don't use Zhaoli as your excuse.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.680
Before you stand against me,

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.200
think carefully of your father

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.510
and your people first.

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:35.530
Che,

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:37.150
this matter ends here.

00:08:37.316 --> 00:08:38.850
Do not bring ruin upon the whole tribe.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.870
- But...
- There is no but.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.720
Between the tribe and Wu Zhaoli,

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.800
you must make

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.320
a choice today.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:58.020
