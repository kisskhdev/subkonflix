00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:36.359
You... what is this?

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:38.240
Going home for the Gaokao or moving the capital?

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.200
Is this really necessary?

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.359
Just in case.

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.759
Come on.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.359
Students whose names are called,

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:03.799
come to the front to get your exam ticket.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.040
Dong Xuefan.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.560
Kong Guifang.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.680
Li Yinling.

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:18.879
Stop reading.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.640
You already know what you can learn.

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.159
Forcing yourself to read what you can't learn,

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:24.120
just adds to your mental burden.

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:25.519
Relax a bit.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.719
Don't be nervous.

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:28.200
Good luck.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.200
Good luck.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.879
Almost all of you are

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:32.959
people who have taken the Gaokao before.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.799
But I still want to remind you of one thing.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.000
You must rest well these two days.

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:39.200
Eat less greasy and spicy food.

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:40.439
I wish you all

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:42.040
a victorious start,

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.719
and admission to your dream university.

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:44.560
Okay.

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.840
Good luck!

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.959
Good luck!

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.240
The pen broke.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.759
That's a bad omen.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.560
A crow is cawing.

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:03.879
That's a bad omen.

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:11.800
Eat faster, eat faster.

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:13.599
What's the rush?

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:15.199
We enter the exam hall at 8:30.

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:16.879
It's not even seven yet.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.360
Don't dawdle, I'm telling you.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.439
Dawdle? What did I do?

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.960
You really... don't need to be so nervous.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.599
What if there's a traffic jam?

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:25.879
What if we can't get a taxi?

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.080
Don't worry. You... this...

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:28.400
draped in this grand red robe...

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.080
rest assured.

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:31.080
This battle robe I picked for you

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.680
brings great luck and prosperity.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.039
I'm more nervous now than the day I gave birth to you.

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:34.240
Exam ticket.

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:36.680
ID card, exam ticket, ruler.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.120
Stop eating. Let's go, let's go.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.840
I was just about to drink.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.879
Put it down, put it down. Let's go, hurry up.

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:41.400
What are you doing?

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.120
Bag.

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:45.120
Don't rush. Why are we going so early?

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.479
What if there's traffic later?

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:47.840
You're such a nag.

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:52.520
I'm going to the bathroom.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.280
Not in a rush anymore?

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:56.599
Then I'll have another sip.

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:00.280
Let's go, let's go. The urge is gone.

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:01.280
The urge is gone.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.159
Stop drinking, stop drinking. Hurry.

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.280
I'll go. I have the urge.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.479
Don't go. Hold it.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.439
Seriously? You won't even let me use the bathroom?

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.599
You won't even let me use the bathroom.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.319
This isn't "fortune has arrived".

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:16.240
Look, it's great. Fortune has arrived.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.720
Don't tell me the fortune fell off.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.079
Today is a good day.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.360
You're wearing your battle robe.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.160
How is that possible?

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:24.000
Don't worry.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.079
Everything will go smoothly.

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:26.120
When the time comes, you'll...

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.519
You'll get everything right.

00:04:27.959 --> 00:04:28.879
What you know, you'll get right.

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:30.120
What you guess, you'll get right.

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:30.720
What are you saying?

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.319
Guessing everything right.

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:32.160
Anyway, just get it all right.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.920
Let's go, let's go.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.959
I need to... go to the bathroom.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.240
Don't go, don't go.

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:38.959
How's business lately?

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.319
Pretty good.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.240
Not bad.

00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:45.720
You've added new items.

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:47.360
Go ahead.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.040
Some people love drinking it.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.199
You didn't eat breakfast this morning.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.240
Just in time to have your old sisters

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.920
cheer you on.

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:53.720
It's really nice.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.319
Buy something to eat.

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:55.160
Go.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.480
Here.

00:04:56.519 --> 00:04:57.439
Really good.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.279
I'll take a beef patty.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.240
Okay, wait a moment. It'll be ready soon.

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:04.240
Sister Zhang.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.839
Starting next month,

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:06.959
this street of ours

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:08.480
will become a night market street.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.759
Future operations

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:11.120
will need to be more regulated.

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:12.959
Like these tables and benches,

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:14.240
they'll be uniformly provided.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.439
Do we have to pay extra for this?

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.199
It's all free.

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:23.199
Considering everyone has it hard.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.879
Good, good, good.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.040
It's ready.

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:31.079
But let me tell you, the sanitation...

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:32.240
still needs attention.

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:33.959
Like these skewers and such.

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:34.839
Come, come, come.

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:35.920
Beef patty. It's hot, it's hot.

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:36.879
That's enough, that's enough.

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:37.480
Enough.

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:38.519
Eat, eat.

00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:40.160
Changed the cover?

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:41.759
Yes, took it a couple of days ago.

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:42.600
Careful, it's hot.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.920
Okay.

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:43.839
Here.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.959
Why go through the trouble twice?

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.399
Here, done. It's hot.

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:51.120
Okay.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.399
Thanks.

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:51.959
Three fifty.

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:52.800
Okay.

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:54.680
Don't worry, Sister Niu.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.959
I'll clean it all up for you.

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:57.560
That's the way.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.879
I'm taking the college entrance exam today.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.199
Taking the exam today, huh?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.560
Here, Auntie will give you a free sausage.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Wish you success.

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:13.600
Auntie wishes you success too.

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:14.639
Do well on the test.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.360
Good luck.

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:17.040
Good luck.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.639
Kong Guifang.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.759
Pigs are flying.

00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:52.720
Pigs are flying.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.160
I want to drop out.

00:06:57.439 --> 00:06:58.279
If I can get in,

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.199
then pigs will fly.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.240
Good luck.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.639
My essay topic is

00:08:12.839 --> 00:08:13.839
My Dream

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.959
My dream is to get into university

00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:18.759
To become a scientist

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.319
And contribute to the country's scientific cause

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.279
Sister Zhang

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.279
Stall fee

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.040
Perhaps when we grow up

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.759
Our lives will be troubled by daily necessities

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:35.320
But please do not forget to look up at the stars

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.720
Do not forget your heart's desire

00:08:38.639 --> 00:08:39.440
Because

00:08:39.639 --> 00:08:42.320
dreams are, on our long journey of life,

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:44.240
the strongest spiritual pillar

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.200
Baku is the capital of which country?

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:45.960
Azerbaijan

00:08:47.799 --> 00:08:48.600
In American history,

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.840
which city had the largest bankruptcy?

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.639
Detroit

00:08:52.639 --> 00:08:53.240
Correct

00:08:53.799 --> 00:08:56.399
Kepler studied under and summarized

00:08:56.399 --> 00:08:56.960
Tycho

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:58.679
It's Tycho

00:08:58.799 --> 00:08:59.360
Nice

00:08:59.919 --> 00:09:02.639
The road ahead may be full of obstacles

00:09:03.039 --> 00:09:04.519
We might lose our direction

00:09:05.039 --> 00:09:06.080
Lose ourselves

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:08.559
But we must never extinguish

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.360
the flame of the dream in our hearts

00:09:10.519 --> 00:09:11.440
Be a good boy, Xiaocan

00:09:12.159 --> 00:09:12.919
Let's watch TV

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.320
Let's learn some knowledge

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.960
In modern Chinese characters,

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.360
which of the following types is the most common?

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.799
A. Onomatopoeic characters

00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:21.360
B. Phono-semantic characters

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.600
Because as long as there is light in our hearts

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.600
We can surely cross towering mountains

00:09:28.279 --> 00:09:30.080
And traverse vast waters

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.879
To reach the shore of our dreams

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.639
And become the best version of ourselves

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.399
I will definitely realize my dream

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.039
So I can study the mysteries of the universe

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.399
The principles of the world

00:09:41.759 --> 00:09:45.000
The unknown territories science has not yet reached

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.840
I think my future

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:50.120
will surely be like this vast unknown

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.720
holding infinite possibilities

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.840
Thank you, Kong Guifang, for sharing

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:25.080
Morning

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.919
I want to read English aloud on campus

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.559
Then in the afternoon when I have no classes

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.919
I'm going to read novels on that lawn

00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:33.000
And in the evening

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.279
In the evening I'll go for a night run on the track

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:36.840
And all those clubs

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.720
Debate competitions and poetry readings

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.639
I have to try them all

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.919
You're talking about college thirty years ago

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.480
I don't mean to rain on your parade

00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:45.759
But college now is just an extension of high school

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.159
Civil service exams, public sector exams

00:10:47.159 --> 00:10:48.200
Grad school exams, English proficiency tests

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:49.440
Oh right, right

00:10:49.679 --> 00:10:50.759
There's also the Student Council

00:10:51.039 --> 00:10:52.639
I need to join and improve myself

00:10:52.639 --> 00:10:53.120
What's there to improve?

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:53.759
Improve what?

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.039
Improve your power-tripping skills?

00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:56.759
Improve skipping classes?

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.240
Let me tell you, there's none of that

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.000
Forget about it

00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:00.960
You child

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.639
Why do you talk back to everything I say?

00:11:03.919 --> 00:11:04.759
It's called "good medicine tastes bitter"

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:05.600
"Honest advice sounds harsh"

00:11:06.519 --> 00:11:08.559
Regarding your beautiful thirty-year vision

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.679
And the fact that it's about to be ruthlessly crushed

00:11:10.679 --> 00:11:12.279
I'm giving you some mental preparation

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:13.600
Also

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.720
About that major of yours

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:16.639
Agriculture

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.120
It is noble, sure

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:20.519
But, you know

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:21.720
It's just...

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.200
How should I put it?

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.440
In the future... well, anyway

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:26.799
I just like it

00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:30.840
Oh, *now* you like it

00:11:31.039 --> 00:11:31.960
Why are you so double-standard?

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.039
When you chose my major back then

00:11:33.039 --> 00:11:34.080
Why didn't you ask if I liked it?

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.360
So what did you like?

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.799
Tell me, what did you like?

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:37.679
I liked Kobe

00:11:38.159 --> 00:11:38.879
Kobe?

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.639
If you don't flunk, that's better than anything

00:11:41.279 --> 00:11:41.840
Whatever you like

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:42.679
You still have to go to school

00:11:42.679 --> 00:11:43.600
When are you going to resume your studies for me?

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:44.399
I'll handle it when I go back

00:11:44.519 --> 00:11:45.080
I'll resume immediately

00:11:45.159 --> 00:11:45.559
Okay?

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.080
Don't you worry about it

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.039
I have a

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.159
Very magnificent

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.080
Thirty-year grand plan

00:11:52.679 --> 00:11:53.919
I'll go there and grind for my GPA

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:54.840
I'll transfer majors

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.360
Transfer to Finance and study Accounting

00:11:56.799 --> 00:11:58.320
Then with a beautiful resume

00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.080
I'll graduate smoothly

00:11:59.559 --> 00:12:00.399
For the first five years

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.600
I'll be a diligent little cog in the machine

00:12:02.919 --> 00:12:03.720
And make steady money

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.159
By the tenth year

00:12:05.399 --> 00:12:06.600
I'll buy us a private apartment

00:12:06.799 --> 00:12:07.200
And pay the mortgage

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.879
But I also need to save some money

00:12:08.879 --> 00:12:10.279
I need to travel around the country

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.639
Visit every province and city

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.039
Besides that

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.879
By the twentieth year

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.440
Apart from paying the mortgage

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.240
I have to visit ten countries

00:12:18.799 --> 00:12:19.720
By the thirtieth year

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.039
The mortgage will be paid off

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.039
With the savings left, I'll travel the world

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.279
I tell you, working out there for a year

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.559
You haven't grown up one bit

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:30.759
You're still constantly thinking about

00:12:30.759 --> 00:12:32.440
Going to this country, that country

00:12:32.759 --> 00:12:34.080
I just want to lie flat now

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.600
Carpe diem, live in the moment

00:12:35.919 --> 00:12:37.440
What do you mean "live in the moment"?

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.840
After you establish your career

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:39.960
Don't you have to start a family?

00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:41.840
You need to have your own little family

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.200
You can't just think about yourself

00:12:46.919 --> 00:12:48.480
But I only have thirty years left.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.000
Thanks, Uncle.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.879
Money really isn't made by saving.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.240
You work your butt off for a whole year...

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.159
...and end up with only twenty-six yuan left.

00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:00.399
Mom, I rhymed.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:01.960
Is that how you calculate it?

00:13:02.279 --> 00:13:03.559
Well, knowledge is priceless.

00:13:04.759 --> 00:13:05.799
Thanks for your trouble.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.279
Let's come back from distant dreams to the daily grind.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.320
Next up...

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.519
Five thousand yuan a year for tuition.

00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:12.360
You earn that yourself, Fang'er.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.840
You know, having good grades really pays off.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.200
Look at Xuefan.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.440
The scores aren't even out yet.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.759
But she's already sold her physics notes.

00:13:22.039 --> 00:13:22.919
I heard that over the summer...

00:13:22.919 --> 00:13:24.399
...she can make tens of thousands tutoring.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:27.600
By the way...

00:13:28.799 --> 00:13:30.519
That physics notebook Xuefan lent me...

00:13:30.519 --> 00:13:31.279
Did you take it out?

00:13:31.639 --> 00:13:32.919
Didn't you clean the bedroom yourself?

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.039
Uncle! Uncle!

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.279
Uncle, wait a second!

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.399
That thing is worth a fortune!

00:13:40.799 --> 00:13:41.360
Uncle!

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:42.960
Uncle!

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.000
Uncle!

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:45.519
Uncle!

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:47.720
Slow down, slow down!

00:13:49.759 --> 00:13:51.240
That uncle really is a good guy.

00:13:51.879 --> 00:13:53.399
We sold so much stuff for just twenty-six yuan.

00:13:53.559 --> 00:13:54.720
And buying the notebook back cost ten.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.720
It's not easy for him either.

00:13:57.799 --> 00:13:58.360
Who has it easy?

00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.320
You gotta bargain.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.080
You... you have to haggle first, right? You...

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.039
You can't just go to someone else.

00:14:03.039 --> 00:14:03.639
He's back.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:04.120
Is it him?

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.039
How was it? How did the exam go?

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.360
Am I talking to you?

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.120
Am I talking to him?

00:14:13.919 --> 00:14:14.879
You've got the wrong person. It's not him.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:15.840
It's not him. It's not him. It's not him.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.399
Did the kid get recognized?

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.120
No, twins.

00:14:21.919 --> 00:14:22.519
That's impossible.

00:14:22.519 --> 00:14:24.320
He gets famous and thinks he's a superstar.

00:14:26.519 --> 00:14:27.799
Gotta keep a low profile when going out.

00:14:28.279 --> 00:14:29.120
Let's put a mask on you next time.

00:14:30.639 --> 00:14:31.320
No, I still have to block for you.

00:14:31.759 --> 00:14:33.000
But isn't this more obvious, bro?

00:14:34.039 --> 00:14:34.600
That makes sense.

00:14:35.159 --> 00:14:36.200
This kid's looks are really troublesome.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:45.639
Brother Xiaocan

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:46.519
I'm back

00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:48.240
Xiao Tian is here

00:14:49.759 --> 00:14:50.799
So that really was you downstairs

00:14:51.039 --> 00:14:52.679
I thought it was your twin brother

00:14:52.679 --> 00:14:53.279
Wei Houtian

00:14:53.919 --> 00:14:54.639
Brother Maizi

00:14:55.399 --> 00:14:56.279
That's my agent

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.879
He says I'm a star

00:14:58.039 --> 00:14:59.240
And I can't just socialize with anyone

00:14:59.519 --> 00:14:59.799
Yeah

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.440
Then you better hurry back to the sky and shine

00:15:01.639 --> 00:15:02.000
Bye-bye

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.879
My... my parents said

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.200
You guys take care of me a lot

00:15:06.279 --> 00:15:07.279
These are potatoes for you

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:10.879
Look

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:11.679
As soon as this star arrives

00:15:11.679 --> 00:15:12.480
Our place has dimmed

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.679
Fine. For your parents' sake

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.639
It wouldn't be right not to have you for dinner

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:17.639
Let yourself in

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.600
Close the door. Thanks, Brother Xiaocan

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.120
Come in, come in, Xiao Tian

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.399
Get him a bowl and chopsticks

00:15:22.879 --> 00:15:23.639
Do you want rice?

00:15:23.799 --> 00:15:24.159
Yes

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:24.960
Wash your hands

00:15:25.159 --> 00:15:25.799
Do you want water?

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:26.720
Yes

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:27.600
We don't have any

00:15:27.679 --> 00:15:28.960
Don't drink water while eating, it's bad for the stomach

00:15:32.759 --> 00:15:33.519
So you know us again

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.600
Here, have a shrimp

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:39.320
Okay

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:40.919
Why didn't you serve me first?

00:15:42.399 --> 00:15:42.960
You have one too

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.080
I'll give you two

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:45.360
It's delicious

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:47.159
If it's good, eat more

00:15:47.639 --> 00:15:48.399
How did the exam go?

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:49.840
No internet at home

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:50.840
Haven't checked the answers yet

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.320
You can check on your phone

00:15:52.559 --> 00:15:53.399
Later when you finish eating

00:15:53.399 --> 00:15:54.360
Check on our computer

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:55.720
My last meal

00:15:56.279 --> 00:15:56.799
Was

00:15:57.159 --> 00:15:58.519
Eaten at home before getting on the train

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.879
I was worried the livestream tonight would be late

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.200
And I'd come back hungry

00:16:02.559 --> 00:16:04.720
Why doesn't your company feed you?

00:16:06.039 --> 00:16:07.679
Look how hungry the kid is

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:08.639
Brother Maizi said

00:16:09.039 --> 00:16:10.159
I've delayed a lot of work

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.159
Look at you

00:16:12.759 --> 00:16:13.480
Big star

00:16:13.799 --> 00:16:15.000
Why live in such an old neighborhood of ours?

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:16.720
This place is great

00:16:17.399 --> 00:16:18.200
It's not old at all

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.320
You're just used to it

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.399
My hometown doesn't even have lights this bright

00:16:22.679 --> 00:16:23.440
Or toilets

00:16:23.919 --> 00:16:24.720
It's all pit latrines

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.679
Okay, let's eat. Let's not talk about that while eating

00:16:27.759 --> 00:16:29.000
So, can you make money?

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.240
Don't look at me like this

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.759
Brother Maizi says

00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:36.159
That I have quite a bit of commercial value

00:16:36.639 --> 00:16:38.320
My tuition for the cram school this year

00:16:38.759 --> 00:16:40.679
He covered it all by having me shoot two videos

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.120
He says this is

00:16:43.879 --> 00:16:44.919
A gift from heaven

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:46.399
Taking a shortcut

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.840
But actually, I just want to be like Brother Xiaocan

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.600
Being ordinary is so nice

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.080
Thanks a lot

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.279
Talk less, eat more

00:16:57.879 --> 00:16:58.720
No talking while eating or sleeping

00:16:59.000 --> 00:16:59.960
Especially someone like you

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.799
Being like him isn't that great either

00:17:01.919 --> 00:17:02.720
Here, have another shrimp

00:17:05.559 --> 00:17:07.160
You give him shrimp but give me cucumber

00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:08.000
Shut up

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:09.559
No talking while eating or sleeping

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:10.240
Eat up

00:17:22.279 --> 00:17:23.880
What is the summer after the Gaokao?

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:26.720
The sea, a driver's license, the beach

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.480
No money, making money, supporting the family

00:17:29.759 --> 00:17:31.000
Then at least dye your hair

00:17:31.759 --> 00:17:33.000
Cousin, Cousin, Cousin

00:17:33.599 --> 00:17:34.920
I'll take you to get a colorful big wave perm

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.359
How about it?

00:17:40.799 --> 00:17:41.519
Why is he here?

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.400
Hello, Brother Li Wai

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.960
Score estimation, score estimation...

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.480
Cousin, you can skip the sea

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:49.480
You can skip the driver's license

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.400
But you definitely have to dye your hair

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:52.359
Why is that?

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:53.359
Think about it

00:17:53.799 --> 00:17:55.079
Once you start working

00:17:55.519 --> 00:17:56.240
And become a corporate slave

00:17:56.359 --> 00:17:57.960
Every single hair becomes precious

00:17:58.079 --> 00:17:59.079
You won't bear to ruin them

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.240
I'll tell you something funny

00:18:01.359 --> 00:18:02.200
Back then, Xiaocan

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.039
Was afraid my godmother would beat him

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.920
After he dyed his hair himself

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.359
He wore a wig

00:18:07.359 --> 00:18:08.559
And wandered around all summer

00:18:08.559 --> 00:18:09.400
Wasn't that a waste of dye?

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.160
You've dyed your hair?

00:18:14.119 --> 00:18:14.920
How much did it cost?

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:15.480
What color?

00:18:16.759 --> 00:18:18.119
Tian, what's your estimated score?

00:18:18.319 --> 00:18:19.240
Should be 550

00:18:19.759 --> 00:18:20.559
550

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.039
Then you're definitely over your province's cutoff

00:18:25.839 --> 00:18:27.240
How much did you actually spend on your hair?

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.119
Tian, what are you doing this summer?

00:18:28.359 --> 00:18:28.880
Part-time job

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.160
Do you guys want to work?

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.359
Lots of livestreams are hiring summer staff

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.400
Yes, yes, yes

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.480
Go, go, go

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:36.960
Go, yes yes, going going

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:38.319
Yes

00:18:40.519 --> 00:18:41.680
Fam, today

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:42.960
The group owner has brought everyone

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.720
Our very good-looking bags

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.000
Link on the left

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:46.720
This model currently

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.880
Sells very well in our market

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:49.880
Click follow

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.319
Come, we have several fashion items today

00:18:52.319 --> 00:18:53.839
Let's look at the first one

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.559
This will be in link number one soon

00:19:04.599 --> 00:19:05.759
Come, babies look here, we

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.640
Will show you the colors again

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.440
Come, babies, you can see

00:19:11.599 --> 00:19:13.960
This washed denim of ours is very classy

00:19:14.119 --> 00:19:16.640
Put it on and you're totally a Korean drama lead

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.279
Come, let's try it on and show everyone

00:19:35.319 --> 00:19:35.920
Got in!

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.400
552

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.200
Awesome

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:43.759
Awesome

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.240
Awesome

00:19:50.799 --> 00:19:51.480
Great

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.920
It's a matte earth-tone eyeshadow palette

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.359
And this is affordable and useful for students

00:20:04.119 --> 00:20:05.200
Little brother, come here a sec

00:20:06.759 --> 00:20:07.720
Help me out with something

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.240
I'm livestreaming

00:20:09.359 --> 00:20:10.519
Come, let's help the little brother try it

00:20:10.519 --> 00:20:12.160
His lips and blush

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.160
And that matte foundation

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.000
Are all here on his face

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.319
Kong Xiaocan

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.480
I'm your elementary school classmate

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.759
You've been having a hard time lately

00:20:22.559 --> 00:20:24.519
We're all here to support you

00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:26.559
Why did the orders explode?

00:20:26.599 --> 00:20:28.400
500 orders! Wake up, little brother

00:20:28.759 --> 00:20:30.519
The whole class came to support you, orders exploded

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.359
No, I can't do this, I gotta go

00:20:32.759 --> 00:20:33.319
I'll help you remove it

00:20:33.319 --> 00:20:34.240
Wait, I'll help you remove it

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:34.880
Leaving just like that?

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:37.519
Waiter

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.119
Bring us another plate of shrimp

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:40.799
Okay

00:20:44.079 --> 00:20:44.599
Your shrimp

00:20:46.119 --> 00:20:47.079
What's wrong with your face?

00:20:47.759 --> 00:20:48.640
Why is it so red?

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.440
It's redder than my shrimp, look

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:54.480
So- sorry

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.720
Awesome

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.039
Awesome

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.519
Awesome

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:39.480
Mom

00:21:39.759 --> 00:21:41.039
Have you made up your mind?

00:21:41.079 --> 00:21:42.000
Just Duxing University.

00:21:44.119 --> 00:21:44.640
I've decided.

00:21:44.839 --> 00:21:45.279
But Mom...

00:21:45.319 --> 00:21:47.400
Actually, there are plenty of good ones locally too.

00:21:54.039 --> 00:21:55.079
Since that's the case, then... then...

00:21:55.839 --> 00:21:57.640
Then con-con... congrats, congrats.

00:21:58.559 --> 00:21:58.920
Congrats.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:22.559
Stop looking at it for now.

00:22:22.839 --> 00:22:23.240
Eat.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:24.440
You'll definitely get in.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:26.839
No, but I haven't received...

00:22:26.839 --> 00:22:27.880
The admission letter.

00:22:28.599 --> 00:22:30.079
Could something have gone wrong?

00:22:30.119 --> 00:22:31.559
Did the scores get adjusted?

00:22:31.599 --> 00:22:33.279
They won't change. They're already out.

00:22:33.279 --> 00:22:35.039
You definitely passed the cutoff score.

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:36.720
Information is all public and transparent now.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.519
What are you worried about?

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.359
No, but where is the admission list?

00:22:39.359 --> 00:22:40.799
It doesn't say Kong Guifang was...

00:22:40.799 --> 00:22:42.720
I'm telling you, don't worry, don't worry.

00:22:42.759 --> 00:22:43.680
And by the way...

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.599
We'll be schoolmates from now on.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.319
Don't be getting physical with me all day.

00:22:47.319 --> 00:22:48.000
Give me some face.

00:22:48.559 --> 00:22:50.359
If you listen to me, why would I hit you?

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.279
No, I still don't feel at ease.

00:22:53.279 --> 00:22:53.960
Help me check.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.640
Kong Guifang's name isn't on here.

00:22:55.759 --> 00:22:56.839
It is, it is. Yes, yes, yes.

00:22:56.839 --> 00:22:57.799
Hurry up and eat.

00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:58.920
You've lost weight recently.

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.039
You're not a pig-style girl anymore.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.200
Pig-style girl.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:02.880
Well, don't you take after me?

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.680
You're a pig-style boy too.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.680
Pig clan mother and son.

00:23:14.279 --> 00:23:14.720
What's wrong?

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.440
Sister Rui restricted you, didn't she?

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:17.519
No.

00:23:18.319 --> 00:23:19.319
Then look at my phone.

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:20.480
She blocked me.

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:21.680
Serves you right.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.039
I mean, with our relationship...

00:23:25.279 --> 00:23:26.160
If you wanted to see my phone...

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.079
You just send me a message.

00:23:27.079 --> 00:23:28.880
I'd zip over and deliver it to your house.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.200
Why bother making the trip yourself?

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.359
You coming to my house is inviting a wolf into the den.

00:23:33.279 --> 00:23:34.000
Why are you insulting me?

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.759
I'm a puppy dog.

00:23:35.799 --> 00:23:36.319
Okay, okay, okay.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.240
You know, the effort you spend guarding against me...

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.799
You should take a good look at your Xu Rui.

00:23:40.079 --> 00:23:41.440
What? Now you know to be worried?

00:23:41.559 --> 00:23:42.119
Shut up.

00:23:43.759 --> 00:23:45.279
This guy looks pretty tall.

00:23:45.599 --> 00:23:46.240
Where's he from?

00:23:47.279 --> 00:23:47.759
From another school.

00:23:49.799 --> 00:23:50.480
Is he handsome or am I?

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:51.720
Then tell me first.

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:52.839
Does Cousin like puppy dogs?

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:53.960
Anyway, she doesn't like you.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:54.599
He's handsome.

00:23:58.759 --> 00:23:59.400
Xiaocan.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:00.559
Xiaocan.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:01.359
Look.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.559
I received the admission letter.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:09.960
Feel better now?

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:11.599
Don't move.

00:24:12.039 --> 00:24:13.119
This... this looks really good.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:13.839
Brother Xiaocan.

00:24:14.839 --> 00:24:16.119
I was also admitted to Duxing University.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.559
I'm in the Hydraulic Engineering major.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:20.359
That's amazing.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.160
Both of you don't move. Don't move.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.240
You've worked hard this year.

00:24:51.519 --> 00:24:53.640
The wish of so many years has finally come true.

00:24:56.039 --> 00:24:57.000
Study hard.

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.400
Student Kong Guifang.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:04.440
Go for it.

00:25:34.839 --> 00:25:36.279
Everyone, stop what you're doing.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.480
We're closing the shop tonight.

00:25:38.839 --> 00:25:40.200
Take a break. Wages as usual.

00:25:43.559 --> 00:25:45.000
This endless rain...

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.799
inevitably makes one feel gloomy too.

00:25:46.799 --> 00:25:48.279
And if you want to boost your happiness,

00:25:48.319 --> 00:25:50.480
what you need most right now is the company of family.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.039
You all have families, right?

00:25:56.079 --> 00:25:57.079
Go on, go home.

00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.279
Boss, are you okay?

00:25:59.559 --> 00:26:00.480
What could be wrong with me?

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.720
People, you know, shouldn't just pursue material things.

00:26:04.039 --> 00:26:05.599
You have to have spiritual pursuits too, right?

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.440
I actually only pursue material things right now.

00:26:09.279 --> 00:26:09.680
No...

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.079
Won't our vegetables go to waste then?

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:12.920
Veggies.

00:26:13.559 --> 00:26:13.920
Take them.

00:26:15.799 --> 00:26:16.200
Meat.

00:26:16.279 --> 00:26:16.640
Take it.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:17.640
And drinks...

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:17.960
Take them.

00:26:18.119 --> 00:26:19.240
Can the wages be raised a bit more?

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.039
Aren't you getting a little too comfortable?

00:26:22.079 --> 00:26:23.319
Go home and be happy, all of you.

00:26:27.799 --> 00:26:29.680
This, this, this... how do I do this?

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:30.839
Cousin.

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:32.519
Let me do it.

00:26:33.759 --> 00:26:34.480
As long as I'm here,

00:26:35.359 --> 00:26:36.960
I won't let anything stump you.

00:26:38.599 --> 00:26:39.240
You do it.

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:45.400
Enter this verification code.

00:26:46.519 --> 00:26:48.319
Look, Kong Guifang.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000
I am simply too handsome.

00:26:52.799 --> 00:26:54.319
Didn't you just enter a verification code?

00:26:56.279 --> 00:26:56.599
Yes.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.319
But Cousin, do you know?

00:27:00.119 --> 00:27:01.440
If you enter the verification code wrong three times,

00:27:01.599 --> 00:27:02.640
do you know what the consequences are?

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:03.880
What consequences?

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.920
You have to wait another five minutes to log in again.

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:08.079
Whereas I...

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:09.599
only used one try.

00:27:23.599 --> 00:27:24.640
Let me see what your major is.

00:27:26.759 --> 00:27:27.759
College of Agriculture.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:29.400
Cousin.

00:27:30.119 --> 00:27:31.400
You really aim high.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.720
You have ideals and ambition.

00:27:32.799 --> 00:27:34.319
You chose such a great major.

00:27:35.799 --> 00:27:37.039
My admiration for you...

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.759
can no longer be expressed in words.

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:39.839
I've decided.

00:27:40.359 --> 00:27:41.119
I'm going to give you a surprise.

00:27:41.519 --> 00:27:42.359
Wait for me. What surprise?

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:43.519
You scared me!

00:27:43.759 --> 00:27:44.359
When did you come in?

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:44.960
You're back.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:45.839
Get away.

00:27:46.039 --> 00:27:46.319
What are you doing?

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:46.680
Come here.

00:27:46.799 --> 00:27:47.039
No...

00:27:47.039 --> 00:27:47.680
I have something to tell you.

00:27:47.799 --> 00:27:48.119
What is it?

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.000
Don't hit me.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:49.640
Cousin is right here.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.319
Can't you give me some face?

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:50.839
Don't move.

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.119
Keep your hands to yourself.

00:27:52.279 --> 00:27:53.000
Out, out, out.

00:27:53.119 --> 00:27:54.039
Cousin, I'll be back in a bit.

00:27:54.039 --> 00:27:54.519
Out, out, out. Cousin!

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:55.279
Brother.

00:27:55.799 --> 00:27:56.839
No, I... I... let me put on my shoes.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:58.640
Let me go in and stay a bit longer.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.640
You see, since I'm already here...

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:00.519
keep me for a meal.

00:28:00.519 --> 00:28:01.119
Stay for dinner, my ass.

00:28:01.119 --> 00:28:01.640
Hurry up, go, go, go.

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:01.880
No...

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.400
Don't you want to know what I'm actually here for?

00:28:04.279 --> 00:28:04.799
What are you here for?

00:28:06.559 --> 00:28:07.119
Cousin...

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:08.599
registering the freshman homepage.

00:28:08.599 --> 00:28:10.279
Such an important thing, and you're not helping her?

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.359
If I weren't there, she wouldn't figure it out.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:13.839
Cousin needs me right now.

00:28:14.039 --> 00:28:14.799
She can't do without me.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:15.319
Get away, get away.

00:28:16.079 --> 00:28:17.119
Step aside. I'm warning you.

00:28:17.119 --> 00:28:17.599
Let me tell you.

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:18.759
I'll tell you the truth. What are you doing?

00:28:18.759 --> 00:28:19.680
Let me go in and see... I'll... I'll...

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.440
I'll tell you the truth.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.440
I'll tell you the truth.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:23.920
My mom's illness...

00:28:35.759 --> 00:28:36.920
Sorry. No... are you okay?

00:28:50.599 --> 00:28:51.440
It was just this close.

00:28:52.359 --> 00:28:52.920
Just this much.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.640
My butt would've blossomed.

00:28:55.839 --> 00:28:56.359
Brother.

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:57.880
You saved my life.

00:28:58.559 --> 00:28:58.880
No.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.200
You saved my butt.

00:29:01.319 --> 00:29:02.000
To repay you,

00:29:02.799 --> 00:29:03.720
alive, I'm your family's ox.

00:29:04.119 --> 00:29:04.960
Dead, I'm your family's horse.

00:29:05.319 --> 00:29:06.920
Dead or alive, I'll slave away for your family.

00:29:09.799 --> 00:29:11.000
If you dare come in, we're done.

00:29:13.799 --> 00:29:14.680
Then I'll come back tomorrow.

00:29:18.599 --> 00:29:19.400
Was it a coincidence?

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.680
My god, Li Wai almost just...

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.119
No, just thinking about it hurts.

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.200
Could it have something to do with me?

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:26.680
The confidentiality thing.

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:29.480
But shouldn't the punishment only target me?

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:32.559
Where's Li Wai?

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:33.920
He went home.

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.119
He went home.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.480
Why didn't he say goodbye before leaving?

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.039
Maybe something came up suddenly.

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.039
So he didn't... didn't...

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.759
Alright, I'll just cook for the two of us then.

00:29:42.759 --> 00:29:43.119
Okay.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.559
Brought back from the barbecue shop.

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.240
Looks pretty fresh.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.160
Then I'll cook with this.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:48.599
Is it?

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:51.200
Now that my mom is going to college,

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.799
we'll be seeing each other all the time.

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.160
Her identity is way too easy to expose.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:56.319
Mom.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:57.359
Look here.

00:29:58.519 --> 00:30:00.880
You've been admitted to Duxing University now.

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.279
Take this and put it in the fridge for me.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.200
From now on, the two of us...

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.799
will be living on the same campus.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:05.920
You have to be careful with your identity.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:06.559
Don't get exposed.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.000
Just tell people you're my cousin.

00:30:08.079 --> 00:30:09.240
Whatever you do, don't say you're my mom.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:10.960
You've been nagging me about this for a year.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.319
My ears are callused from listening to it.

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.119
Then later when I go to register,

00:30:17.119 --> 00:30:18.599
if they ask me, what should I say?

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.160
Well, if they ask about it...

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.079
My... that ID card.

00:30:21.079 --> 00:30:22.359
Do I fill in the real one or a fake one?

00:30:22.799 --> 00:30:24.200
No, well, you definitely have to fill in the real one.

00:30:24.839 --> 00:30:26.000
But about the age...

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.519
What if they don't notice the age?

00:30:27.519 --> 00:30:28.319
Just... just fudge it.

00:30:28.319 --> 00:30:29.759
If it's absolutely unavoidable,

00:30:30.319 --> 00:30:32.039
you still have to admit to your age.

00:30:32.559 --> 00:30:33.480
As for the rest,

00:30:34.039 --> 00:30:36.119
I'll explain the looking young part to the school later.

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:37.559
Okay.

00:30:40.839 --> 00:30:41.400
But we... we...

00:30:42.359 --> 00:30:43.359
I have to say, Mom.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.839
You're about to be a young, beautiful college student.

00:30:45.839 --> 00:30:46.559
But on you...

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.279
the middle-aged vibe is still a bit strong.

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.880
Like "Community warmth for everyone."

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:50.680
You need to change these clothes.

00:30:50.759 --> 00:30:51.680
Let's go buy new clothes in a couple of days.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.359
Don't waste money on me.

00:30:53.519 --> 00:30:54.440
This is very durable.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:59.160
Why buy me so many clothes?

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.279
We have all the daily necessities too.

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.519
The stuff at home is years old.

00:31:02.519 --> 00:31:03.599
You need to buy new ones for school.

00:31:03.599 --> 00:31:04.279
That would look so good.

00:31:04.279 --> 00:31:05.000
You're just wasting money.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:05.599
Wash it and it's still usable.

00:31:13.559 --> 00:31:14.440
What are you doing? Go in.

00:31:15.079 --> 00:31:16.079
Don't block the door, hurry up.

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.039
Xu Rui, let's switch seats.

00:31:22.519 --> 00:31:23.039
Don't get bumped.

00:31:28.359 --> 00:31:29.759
No, buddy, why are you switching seats?

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.000
Sorry, sorry.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:46.640
Where do you think you're going?

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:48.319
Babe.

00:31:49.279 --> 00:31:50.000
Surprised?

00:31:50.759 --> 00:31:51.240
Shocked?

00:31:56.279 --> 00:31:57.160
Let's... let's go outside and talk.

00:31:58.599 --> 00:31:59.400
I heard.

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:01.759
You met a pretty new sports student.

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.920
Fawning over her everywhere.

00:32:04.519 --> 00:32:06.200
I came back as soon as I finished my competition.

00:32:07.599 --> 00:32:08.599
I realized.

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.759
You really are forever young.

00:32:11.519 --> 00:32:12.799
Forever liking sports students.

00:32:14.839 --> 00:32:15.559
So consistent.

00:32:16.519 --> 00:32:17.079
Little sister.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.359
Did you know he has a girlfriend?

00:32:21.759 --> 00:32:22.920
Should I know?

00:32:23.599 --> 00:32:24.599
Or should I not know?

00:32:25.799 --> 00:32:26.519
Doesn't matter.

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.359
You go first or me?

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:31.839
Let's do it together.

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:35.240
Scumbag.

00:32:37.519 --> 00:32:38.039
Scumbag.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:44.680
Sorry, sorry.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:45.680
Let's take the next one.

00:32:46.319 --> 00:32:47.039
Save me.

00:32:50.519 --> 00:32:51.039
That's enough.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.640
Stop hitting me! I admitted I was wrong, didn't I?

00:32:57.519 --> 00:32:58.279
Not there!

00:33:04.599 --> 00:33:05.200
Bro, bro.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.079
Help me, bro!

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:08.519
This is way too melodramatic.

00:33:08.759 --> 00:33:09.920
It's like watching a TV drama, Mom.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:10.920
How can it be like this?

00:33:11.119 --> 00:33:12.039
There's something even more melodramatic.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:13.160
Right.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:14.480
Right, right, right.

00:33:14.839 --> 00:33:16.039
That girl is your high school classmate.

00:33:16.039 --> 00:33:16.480
Isn't she?

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:17.519
The one you liked.

00:33:17.519 --> 00:33:18.200
You chased after her.

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.160
Mom saw that photo at home.

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:21.920
What a coincidence.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.039
How did we all end up here?

00:33:23.279 --> 00:33:24.160
That is indeed melodramatic.

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.359
The girl is really pretty.

00:33:26.799 --> 00:33:28.319
I can understand why she didn't pick you.

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.000
But that guy is even worse.

00:33:30.319 --> 00:33:31.319
She'd be better off with my son.

00:33:34.079 --> 00:33:35.599
Son, Mom didn't mean that.

00:33:37.039 --> 00:33:37.799
This... this mouth.

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.000
You want a beating too?

00:34:05.599 --> 00:34:06.000
No.

00:34:07.079 --> 00:34:07.559
Xu Rui.

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:09.840
I want to explain to you.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.320
Back then, my mom was critically ill.

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:12.920
My family had no money left.

00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:14.280
I felt I wasn't good enough for you.

00:34:14.559 --> 00:34:15.840
I thought breaking up was for your own good.

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.079
Until today, seeing you with someone else...

00:34:18.719 --> 00:34:20.199
...I realized I can't live without you.

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:21.119
Kong Xiaocan.

00:34:22.039 --> 00:34:23.119
Is that something a human says?

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:25.920
Money can be earned back.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:27.920
If a life is lost, it's gone for good.

00:34:29.079 --> 00:34:30.280
I don't want to have regrets.

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:32.360
And I don't want you to misunderstand me anymore.

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:35.840
Let me tell you the truth.

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:38.760
I actually... for my mom...

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.159
I'm sorry.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:04.400
I'm telling you the tru...

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:13.920
If you dare reveal my existence to anyone...

00:35:14.159 --> 00:35:15.360
You will receive...

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:18.280
A very, very severe punishment.

00:35:20.679 --> 00:35:22.000
Xu Rui, wait for me a second. I'll be right back.

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.119
Right, if there's a door, I can get in.

00:35:46.719 --> 00:35:47.119
A Fu

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:48.440
A Fu

00:35:51.079 --> 00:35:51.800
A Fu, ah

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:56.000
A Fu

00:35:58.639 --> 00:35:59.880
Alright, A Fu, you're not coming out, are you?

00:36:00.639 --> 00:36:02.559
Don't force me to breach the contract if you don't come out.

00:36:03.079 --> 00:36:05.280
I'll tell everyone about Life Energy.

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.400
I'll tell passersby.

00:36:06.519 --> 00:36:08.239
I'll tell animals about the Life Energy exchange.

00:36:08.239 --> 00:36:09.679
Dear

00:36:13.119 --> 00:36:13.960
Kong Xiaocan, what are you doing?

00:36:14.239 --> 00:36:15.079
Can't you speak properly?

00:36:15.079 --> 00:36:15.800
Don't grab my collar.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.159
Is it that if I tell others...

00:36:17.159 --> 00:36:18.760
...about you or the Life Energy transaction...

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:19.679
...they will get punished?

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.519
Isn't it all written in the contract?

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.400
Confidentiality Agreement.

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.880
Article 3, Clause 5.

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:27.800
It's all written in Point 4.

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.320
What does my own business have to do with others?

00:36:30.039 --> 00:36:31.039
Th- These punishments...

00:36:31.199 --> 00:36:32.079
...won't be fatal.

00:36:32.159 --> 00:36:33.960
At most a little superficial injury.

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:34.840
Wait until you...

00:36:35.159 --> 00:36:36.679
...end your lifespan...

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:37.920
...and after you die...

00:36:38.039 --> 00:36:40.000
...everything will return to normal. It's very fast.

00:36:40.519 --> 00:36:40.960
Very fast.

00:36:42.039 --> 00:36:42.840
How fast is very fast?

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:44.519
Even if I gave up twenty-five years...

00:36:44.519 --> 00:36:45.559
...it shouldn't be that fast, right?

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:50.280
Please look.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.280
Here, deducting wear and tear, interest,

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.440
and alien labor fees...

00:36:59.239 --> 00:37:00.119
Fifty years.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.599
This is your transaction contract.

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.480
This is the basic status of your Life Energy.

00:37:04.679 --> 00:37:05.559
This is the special notice.

00:37:05.599 --> 00:37:07.159
Violation circumstances and your punishment details.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.079
This is the party involved.

00:37:08.599 --> 00:37:09.320
This is your collateral status.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.639
And Life Energy equity commitment.

00:37:11.559 --> 00:37:12.119
Come, come, come.

00:37:13.039 --> 00:37:15.840
Didn't I remind you to read carefully before?

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:22.440
Fifty years.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.159
Wasn't it twenty-five years?

00:37:31.679 --> 00:37:32.480
Fifty years.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:35.079
Wasn't it twenty-five years?

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.960
It's in black and white, you can't go back on it.

00:37:39.599 --> 00:37:40.000
No.

00:37:40.199 --> 00:37:40.599
What do you mean?

00:37:40.599 --> 00:37:42.239
How is it fifty years? A Fu, ah!

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:43.840
A Fu!

00:37:44.599 --> 00:37:45.199
A Fu!

00:37:47.119 --> 00:37:47.800
A Fu!

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:49.679
A Fu, you liar!

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:57.199
I have a very great...

00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.199
...thirty-year grand vision.

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:01.800
I'll boost my GPA when I get there.

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:03.000
I'll transfer majors.

00:38:03.639 --> 00:38:04.920
Transfer to Finance and learn Accounting.

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.920
Then with a beautiful resume...

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:08.679
...graduate smoothly.

00:38:10.119 --> 00:38:11.079
The first five years...

00:38:11.079 --> 00:38:13.119
...I'll honestly be a small cog in the machine first.

00:38:13.679 --> 00:38:14.760
By the tenth year...

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.239
...buy us an apartment.

00:38:17.039 --> 00:38:17.719
Gotta save some money too.

00:38:17.719 --> 00:38:19.159
I have to travel around the country.

00:38:20.039 --> 00:38:21.559
By the twentieth year...

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.119
...I have to visit ten countries.

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:26.719
By the thirtieth year...

00:38:27.159 --> 00:38:27.960
...the mortgage will be paid off.

00:38:28.199 --> 00:38:30.000
With the remaining savings, I have to travel the world.

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:33.559
Totaling fifty years.

00:38:36.239 --> 00:38:37.159
Fifty years.

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:38.960
What size does he roughly wear?

00:38:39.559 --> 00:38:40.679
Our sizes run large.

00:38:40.679 --> 00:38:41.840
You can just choose size M.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:42.480
Okay, okay, okay.

00:38:42.559 --> 00:38:44.039
Do you want to give it to a boyfriend?

00:38:44.119 --> 00:38:44.679
No, no, no.

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:46.199
It's just a...

00:38:46.719 --> 00:38:47.800
...person I want to thank.

00:38:48.039 --> 00:38:50.000
Alright then, see which color you like.

00:38:50.039 --> 00:38:50.800
I'll wrap it up for you.

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:52.159
Okay, give me one.

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:14.920
I'm still waiting for him.

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:17.360
Xu Rui.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:22.199
What do you want to say?

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.400
Forget everything I just said.

00:39:30.559 --> 00:39:32.320
Ho- Hope you'll be happy.

00:39:42.079 --> 00:39:42.639
Scumbag.

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:44.840
They're all scumbags.
