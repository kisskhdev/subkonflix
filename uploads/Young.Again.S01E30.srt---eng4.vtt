00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.519
Professor Fan

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:02.980
Ms. Liu

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:04.319
Thanks, kid

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.239
Ms. Liu, please sit

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.259
Thank you

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:10.939
This is for my...

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.060
...published collection...

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.139
...a small celebration ceremony

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:16.280
Thank you

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.439
Just...

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.620
...the two of us?

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:20.699
Just two people?

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.699
Isn't that nice?

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.840
I mean, aren't you afraid...

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.639
...of gossip spreading in our community?

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.759
So what?

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.159
No, I was thinking, if...

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:35.360
...we invited one more person...

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.599
...it would be nice to be together

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:38.960
I don't think that's necessary

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.319
I'm treating you, Ms. Liu, to dinner

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:42.099
What's wrong with that?

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:44.680
Why fear gossip in the community?

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.159
I'm mainly worried about Boss Li

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.120
If he knew...

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.120
...that the two of us were eating alone together...

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.479
...he probably wouldn't be happy

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.719
He would inevitably...

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:54.319
...gossip about this and that

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.000
I don't care about any Boss Li

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:58.000
If he hears about it and gets unhappy...

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.439
...it has nothing to do with me

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:00.699
That's his own problem

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:01.840
How could that be?

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:04.199
If Old Li heard... Boss Li...

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:05.699
...would also be very happy

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:07.180
Ms. Liu, please sit

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.039
Okay, thanks

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.719
Professor Fan

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:09.919
You sit too

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.759
Don't stand on ceremony

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:12.319
Your nose is quite sharp

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.340
A single nose...

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:16.939
...how much power can it have?

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.800
Organs must help each other...

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.479
...to see all directions and hear all quarters

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.060
Only then can the tongue taste a hundred flavors...

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:25.280
...and enjoy spicy and savory food

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.199
That is...

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:27.479
...coming uninvited...

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.139
...face thick as a city wall

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.719
...mooching food and drink...

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.120
...bowls clean and plates empty

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.360
...eating and taking...

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.680
...either stealing or robbing

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.520
Alright, Professor Fan

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.060
Say a little less

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.099
It's just adding a pair of chopsticks

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:41.520
How can one pair of chopsticks be enough?

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.120
As a roommate sharing a room with Professor Fan...

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.439
...eating, living, and working together...

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.139
I have an obligation...

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.860
...to help him improve relations with the masses

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.099
So I invited a host of heroes...

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.000
...and sent out hero invitations everywhere

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.360
Come on, children

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:58.500
Come on

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.900
Coming

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.819
Hello, elders

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.800
Grandma Liu, Grandpa Fan

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:06.259
Sit

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:07.280
Don't be shy, everyone

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.620
Sit

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.060
You sit over there

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.479
You're welcome

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:10.159
Everyone coming gives me face

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:11.460
Today, everyone...

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:13.439
...must order their favorite dish

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:14.180
Okay

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.659
Boss Li

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:16.040
Are you treating?

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:16.480
Yes

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.319
I'm treating

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.240
Professor Fan pays the bill

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.839
After all...

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:21.959
...I haven't received my royalties...

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.720
...how can I afford to treat?

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.279
As...

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:26.420
...Old Fan's roommate who eats, lives, and works with him...

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.399
...I need to organize things for him

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.879
So,

00:04:31.019 --> 00:04:32.040
can we order now?

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.720
Order away.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.060
Let's get a meat dish.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.420
Dongpo pork elbow.

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:36.980
Grandpa Li,

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.639
the food at our retirement community

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.300
is just way too healthy.

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:41.560
I'm starved for meat.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.360
Order it!

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:43.459
Add a fish, too.

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:44.279
Two fish.

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.879
Two.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.720
Since we're having fish,

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.639
let's get shrimp. Braised prawns.

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:48.220
That's the one.

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:50.180
Can we order one to go?

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.879
Sure.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.959
Wang Song is on duty today.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.800
Is that really for Wang Song?

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:57.199
You'll just eat it as a midnight snack.

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:57.720
So what?

00:04:57.759 --> 00:04:59.259
You never miss a midnight snack.

00:04:59.339 --> 00:05:00.899
You just rely on eating without getting fat.

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:01.579
I don't gain weight.

00:05:01.579 --> 00:05:02.439
I just don't gain weight.

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:03.379
Unlike you.

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:04.220
You've got plenty of meat on you.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.980
You definitely gain weight.

00:05:05.019 --> 00:05:06.019
Get him a roast duck.

00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:06.660
To go.

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:07.240
Okay.

00:05:11.079 --> 00:05:11.699
Auntie Cai.

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:13.000
Hello there.

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:14.860
Director Chang is here.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.399
Who's this young man?

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:17.459
Let me introduce you.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.920
This is Xiao Long.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.480
He's the community's newly hired...

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.360
massage therapist.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.800
He specializes in serving seniors.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.939
Hello, Auntie Cai.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:27.420
That's great.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.800
He's quite a handsome boy.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.079
How old are you?

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.480
Are you married?

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.939
Is everyone done?

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:38.360
No need to add more dishes?

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.180
We could add a couple.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.800
Zhu Zhu.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.120
That's enough.

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:43.759
Look,

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:46.040
the plates are licked clean.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.000
We didn't leave anything for Wang Song.

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:50.079
Xiaoxin, bill please.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:52.899
That's 720 in total.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.100
Just give me 700.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.959
Don't.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.019
Let's stick to 720.

00:05:56.019 --> 00:05:56.500
It's easier to calculate.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.839
There are seven of us.

00:05:58.839 --> 00:05:59.839
Ninety per person.

00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:01.139
Zhu Zhu, you pay double.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.720
Why should I?

00:06:03.019 --> 00:06:04.360
You ate more than your share.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.199
I saw you eat enough for three people just now.

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:08.139
What does that mean?

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:09.459
What's going on here?

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.500
Splitting the bill.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:11.579
Everyone pays for themselves.

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:12.399
It's the old rule.

00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:13.259
That's a good rule.

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:14.680
I'm all for it.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.439
I'll pay for you.

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.899
No.

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:16.819
No need.

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:17.699
No need, Professor Fan.

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:19.259
I know how to use WeChat Pay.

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:20.560
Ms. Liu knows how.

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:21.860
Besides,

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:22.680
if we're splitting,

00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:24.420
I should be the one covering Ms. Liu.

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:25.720
Wait, that's not right.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.480
Today is your treat.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.379
I didn't invite you.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.759
Am I that passive?

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:33.000
To wait for someone to offer to treat me?

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:34.639
You need to read the room.

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:36.959
Didn't you get your royalties?

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.879
That's why we're all gathered here.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.000
It's not right to welch on this.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.240
Who's trying to welch?

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:43.259
Professor Fan,

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:45.220
we appreciate the gesture.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.980
But the old rule stands.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.300
Old rules are meant to be broken.

00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:50.579
No construction without destruction.

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:51.500
Fine.

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:52.540
Boss Li, how about this.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.439
Next time you treat,

00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:55.800
we'll break the rule then.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:56.740
How does that sound?

00:06:56.899 --> 00:06:57.480
That works too.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:58.959
Why should I?

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.819
I didn't get any royalties.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.139
It's not like I can't get them.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:04.420
If we break it,

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:05.860
we have to break it this time.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:06.779
This time

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:09.259
is the best time to break old habits.

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:09.819
Boss Li,

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:12.199
Splitting the bill isn't an old habit.

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:14.480
It's an advanced practice from abroad.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.439
We should take the lead in promoting it.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.040
We take the lead in promoting it.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.040
Kid,

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.420
swallow what's in your mouth

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.459
before you speak.

00:07:21.519 --> 00:07:22.560
Or you'll choke.

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:23.220
It's fine.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.620
Is foreign experience necessarily advanced?

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.120
I don't think so.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.180
Whoever invites,

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.040
pays the bill.

00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:31.939
This is part of our

00:07:31.939 --> 00:07:34.779
traditional Chinese dining culture.

00:07:34.839 --> 00:07:36.259
And it has a long history.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.899
A long history

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.360
doesn't necessarily mean correct.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:40.939
Foot binding and opium smoking

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.079
also had long histories.

00:07:42.439 --> 00:07:43.399
China is developing.

00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:44.360
The country is progressing.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.839
Only a blockhead

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.060
would refuse to accept change.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:47.959
Who?

00:07:47.959 --> 00:07:49.040
A blockhead?

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.839
You two,

00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:53.220
can you stop bickering for a moment?

00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:54.740
Not in front of the kids.

00:07:54.839 --> 00:07:56.579
We were born in the reform era.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.439
We're more open to new things.

00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:00.399
Older people

00:08:00.459 --> 00:08:01.420
sticking to tradition

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.740
is understandable too.

00:08:03.079 --> 00:08:03.980
Let me think.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.720
Which is actually better?

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.339
Accepting the new?

00:08:08.779 --> 00:08:10.100
Or sticking to tradition?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.519
Ms. Liu

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.160
Which one do you think is better?

00:08:14.279 --> 00:08:15.819
I'll stand on whichever side you're on.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.160
I...

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.519
I haven't quite wrapped my head around it yet.

00:08:19.579 --> 00:08:20.519
I'm the same as you.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.660
I haven't wrapped my head around it either.

00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:24.019
Anyway, I firmly support splitting the bill.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.540
Whatever you support, I oppose.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.300
I support splitting the bill for meals.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.699
It shows I have a youthful mindset.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.120
It doesn't show you have a youthful mindset.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.300
It only shows you're stingy.

00:08:31.819 --> 00:08:33.299
It shows your old brain isn't open to new things.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.019
You're an old cucumber painted green.

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:35.980
You're painting it even thicker.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.960
Alright, can you two stop bickering?

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.259
It's okay, Grandma Liu.

00:08:40.259 --> 00:08:40.679
I...

00:08:40.779 --> 00:08:41.840
just love watching them fight.

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:43.779
Fine.

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:45.440
For the sake of Ms. Liu...

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.799
I'll let you off the hook today.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.659
But I must tell you...

00:08:48.879 --> 00:08:49.539
children...

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.200
although we are older than you...

00:08:53.379 --> 00:08:54.220
by a year or two...

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:55.960
if we start playing...

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:56.860
we play at a higher level than you.

00:08:57.259 --> 00:08:58.600
You guys care about splitting the bill.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:58.980
Right.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.460
If we play, it's taking turns treating.

00:09:01.659 --> 00:09:02.580
Today he treats.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:03.980
Tomorrow I treat.

00:09:04.159 --> 00:09:04.799
The day after tomorrow...

00:09:05.659 --> 00:09:06.320
he treats again.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.879
Why is it me again?

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.100
It should be...

00:09:09.259 --> 00:09:09.840
your turn.

00:09:10.039 --> 00:09:10.960
Why should it be me?

00:09:11.039 --> 00:09:11.940
Of course it's you.

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:12.620
I have to say,

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.580
Grandpa Boss Li is an upgraded version.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:15.960
AA 2.0.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.019
Still eating?

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:18.620
Let's go, Ms. Liu.

00:09:32.559 --> 00:09:33.440
Are you okay?

00:09:33.659 --> 00:09:34.320
I'm fine.

00:09:34.799 --> 00:09:35.779
It's just a little itchy.

00:09:35.779 --> 00:09:36.139
It's fine.

00:09:36.139 --> 00:09:36.820
You carry on.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:47.539
Me?

00:09:47.759 --> 00:09:49.139
I'm ticklish all over

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.100
I can't be touched

00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:52.620
What should I do then?

00:09:52.919 --> 00:09:54.120
It's fine

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.720
Go over to Number 3

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.440
try Uncle Liang

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.580
He loves that stuff

00:09:58.679 --> 00:09:59.700
Okay, Auntie Cai

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:00.539
I'll go right now

00:10:00.879 --> 00:10:01.399
Hey

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:02.820
Xiao Long

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:03.840
Do you really

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.000
not have a girlfriend?

00:10:05.259 --> 00:10:05.919
Well...

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:07.419
how should I put it?

00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:08.820
Just tell the truth

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.279
Either you do or you don't

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.980
Back in my hometown

00:10:12.259 --> 00:10:13.600
my parents introduced one

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:15.340
But I didn't like her

00:10:15.759 --> 00:10:16.840
There was no love

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.399
Arranged marriage? No way

00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:21.500
It's a lifelong commitment

00:10:21.559 --> 00:10:23.100
How can it work without love?

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.179
Come here

00:10:25.139 --> 00:10:25.899
Don't worry

00:10:25.899 --> 00:10:26.480
It's no problem

00:10:26.919 --> 00:10:28.899
Auntie Cai will introduce one to you

00:10:29.039 --> 00:10:30.360
Young and beautiful

00:10:30.399 --> 00:10:31.740
with a great personality

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.179
I guarantee the moment you meet

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:36.039
love will strike immediately

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.139
What's the harm in meeting?

00:10:39.299 --> 00:10:40.360
That young man

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.340
has great prospects

00:10:42.659 --> 00:10:44.299
Tall and handsome

00:10:44.419 --> 00:10:45.740
He'd make a great boyfriend

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:47.919
He has skills

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.980
and a good personality too

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:51.399
Let me put it this way

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:53.879
his biggest flaw is

00:10:54.059 --> 00:10:55.179
he's too outstanding

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.799
How is being outstanding a flaw?

00:10:58.159 --> 00:10:59.559
Being too outstanding...

00:10:59.779 --> 00:11:00.299
think about it

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:01.200
In your lifetime

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.399
how many girls will compete with you?

00:11:03.399 --> 00:11:04.039
Isn't that annoying?

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:04.960
Isn't that a flaw?

00:11:05.039 --> 00:11:06.980
If he's really as great as you say

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.720
how come he doesn't have a girlfriend?

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:10.559
Back in our village

00:11:10.559 --> 00:11:12.259
if someone isn't married by now

00:11:12.519 --> 00:11:13.799
there's definitely something wrong with them

00:11:14.419 --> 00:11:15.820
No

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:16.980
There's absolutely nothing wrong

00:11:17.559 --> 00:11:18.340
Xiao Long here

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.940
mouth isn't crooked, eyes aren't crossed

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.639
He doesn't limp at all, right?

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.320
He is totally a... what is it?

00:11:23.639 --> 00:11:25.019
An idol youth

00:11:25.059 --> 00:11:25.679
Who?

00:11:25.759 --> 00:11:26.299
Who?

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.759
Who?

00:11:27.759 --> 00:11:30.120
Who's still attached?

00:11:30.259 --> 00:11:31.600
How did we wake her up?

00:11:33.039 --> 00:11:34.360
Go back to sleep

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.019
I'm not sleepy

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.840
The moon is bright

00:11:40.899 --> 00:11:42.179
The wind...

00:11:54.539 --> 00:11:55.240
What are you looking at?

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:56.899
Seeing when you're gonna treat me.

00:11:58.419 --> 00:11:59.100
Is that all?

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.500
You've been harping on this all afternoon.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.799
Have you not eaten anything?

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.580
Just waiting for me to treat you?

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:09.600
That's the plan.

00:12:11.019 --> 00:12:11.480
Fine.

00:12:11.919 --> 00:12:13.279
You really are something.

00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:15.220
This guy...

00:12:16.019 --> 00:12:16.620
Okay.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.519
I'll give you a firm date.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.379
The day I receive my writing fee

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.799
is the day you get your feast.

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:26.799
You promise?

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.620
When has Old Li ever broken his word?

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.460
So when do you get the fee?

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:30.860
Soon.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:32.200
Specifically.

00:12:32.559 --> 00:12:34.000
Specifically when?

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.679
Well, I have to wait for the article to be published.

00:12:35.679 --> 00:12:37.759
So when will your article be published?

00:12:37.919 --> 00:12:38.860
Well, I have to write it first.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.980
So when will you write it?

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.899
Once I've thought it through, I'll write it.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:43.960
So when will you...

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:46.919
You haven't even decided what to write?

00:12:47.139 --> 00:12:48.620
You're spending this meal on credit?

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.600
Spending tomorrow's money.

00:12:50.299 --> 00:12:52.539
You're really getting way ahead of yourself.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.000
Auntie Cai.

00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:01.259
Auntie Cai.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.700
A Jian? Do you need something?

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.779
Shh, keep your voice down.

00:13:06.399 --> 00:13:07.679
Do you need something?

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.139
You looking for me?

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.480
You can speak up now.

00:13:14.759 --> 00:13:15.299
What is it?

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.600
You'd better keep it down.

00:13:17.779 --> 00:13:18.399
Auntie Cai.

00:13:18.679 --> 00:13:19.960
I heard you're playing matchmaker.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.899
Setting Xiaofang up with that new guy, Xiao Long.

00:13:22.179 --> 00:13:22.960
That's right.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.519
You even heard about that?

00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:26.159
What do you think?

00:13:26.159 --> 00:13:26.919
They're a good match, right?

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.100
Are they?

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:29.340
If there's such a good opportunity...

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:30.799
Why didn't you introduce her to me?

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:34.580
Right.

00:13:34.679 --> 00:13:36.500
You're still single, aren't you?

00:13:37.139 --> 00:13:38.440
I overlooked that.

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.039
Auntie will find you another one.

00:13:41.179 --> 00:13:41.580
Tell me.

00:13:41.639 --> 00:13:42.659
What kind do you want?

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:43.919
I don't want any kind.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.059
I just like Xiaofang.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.419
No problem.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.320
Later I'll just...

00:13:48.899 --> 00:13:50.460
You like Xiaofang too?

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.559
Isn't that a conflict?

00:13:52.879 --> 00:13:53.580
Just...

00:13:55.519 --> 00:13:56.580
Look at you, kid.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:57.179
These feelings of yours...

00:13:57.179 --> 00:13:59.179
You didn't tell your Auntie sooner.

00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:00.320
How could I tell you?

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.200
I didn't know if...

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.580
Xiaofang would be willing or not.

00:14:02.679 --> 00:14:03.820
I can't just go blabbing everywhere.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.679
Nothing's even happened yet.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.799
You haven't even made a move yet.

00:14:07.879 --> 00:14:09.500
Let's not talk about that, it's not important.

00:14:09.639 --> 00:14:10.480
The problem is...

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:11.700
That girl Xiaofang...

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.340
She can't be split in half, right?

00:14:13.379 --> 00:14:14.799
Splitting her into pieces wouldn't help.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:15.559
It's all your fault.

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:17.639
I was proceeding according to plan.

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:18.759
I thought once I went permanent...

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:19.820
I'd confess my feelings to her.

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.539
Who knew you'd butt in like this.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.120
You cut in, and he won the hand.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.080
I just handed Xiaofang over to Xiao Long.

00:14:25.919 --> 00:14:26.679
Don't worry, kid.

00:14:26.679 --> 00:14:27.139
Don't worry.

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.299
Auntie will find you a good one later.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.220
Come on, I...

00:14:30.559 --> 00:14:32.100
You don't want... look what you've done.

00:14:32.779 --> 00:14:33.519
Let's think.

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.299
Let's see if there's a better way.

00:14:36.639 --> 00:14:37.600
Competition!

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:38.799
Our A Jian...

00:14:38.799 --> 00:14:40.580
Can totally compete fairly with him.

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:40.940
That's right.

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:41.700
Exactly.

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.840
Our A Jian isn't stupid or slow.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.639
What do you mean "not stupid or slow"?

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.360
He's practically capable and smart.

00:14:47.419 --> 00:14:49.399
Simply cultivated inside and out.

00:14:49.659 --> 00:14:51.460
Totally got both brains and brawn.

00:14:51.639 --> 00:14:53.639
If he doesn't join a boy band...

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.279
It's a total waste of talent.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.299
I think...

00:14:56.419 --> 00:14:57.720
We should help A Jian.

00:14:57.779 --> 00:14:59.379
Come up with some practical ideas.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:01.139
I actually have an idea.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:02.419
I just don't know...

00:15:02.419 --> 00:15:03.100
If it'll work.

00:15:05.899 --> 00:15:06.940
Is this okay, Uncle Liang?

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.240
Is it too hard?

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.240
Not at all.

00:15:10.399 --> 00:15:11.299
It's perfect.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.299
Feels good.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:14.559
If you...

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:15.860
Aren't afraid of getting tired...

00:15:15.919 --> 00:15:17.080
Use a bit more force.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.059
Your Uncle Liang can take it.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:18.639
Okay.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:20.919
Come in.

00:15:27.279 --> 00:15:28.220
Uncle Liang.

00:15:28.539 --> 00:15:30.000
I'm here to clean for you.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.340
Go ahead.

00:15:31.539 --> 00:15:31.860
I...

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:32.919
I won't chat with you anymore.

00:15:32.919 --> 00:15:33.860
You go about your business.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.580
Brother Liu speaks

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.039
with too much bias

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:52.980
You young lady are from our Henan too?

00:15:53.379 --> 00:15:54.039
That's right.

00:15:54.519 --> 00:15:56.080
Which part of Henan are you from?

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.100
I'm from Zhumadian.

00:15:57.159 --> 00:15:57.740
And you?

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:58.600
Me?

00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.559
I'm from Shangqiu.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.019
You two have found a fellow townsman.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:07.320
We're all away from home making a living.

00:16:07.559 --> 00:16:08.639
How many kids do you have back home?

00:16:08.639 --> 00:16:09.500
Just two.

00:16:09.799 --> 00:16:10.600
Two?

00:16:11.019 --> 00:16:12.580
You started a family so young?

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.139
We settle down early back there.

00:16:15.759 --> 00:16:16.580
No.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:17.799
No?

00:16:18.679 --> 00:16:20.299
You have two kids without being married?

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:21.659
No.

00:16:21.879 --> 00:16:22.879
I mean...

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.919
there is no love.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.320
Easy there, you.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.379
Are you done yet?

00:16:34.659 --> 00:16:36.220
You latch onto me for food and won't let go.

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:38.159
Courtesy demands reciprocity.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.580
It's also our nation's excellent tradition.

00:16:40.639 --> 00:16:42.720
It is indecent not to reciprocate.

00:16:43.139 --> 00:16:43.840
Don't talk nonsense.

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:45.759
Who did I act indecently with?

00:16:48.259 --> 00:16:49.059
Fine.

00:16:50.039 --> 00:16:50.559
I'll treat.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:52.039
I'll treat, okay?

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:53.220
Time?

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:54.139
Tonight.

00:16:54.559 --> 00:16:55.120
Location?

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:56.159
Private room.

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:58.440
I didn't say I was inviting you.

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:01.820
I didn't invite you yesterday,

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:03.139
but you showed up anyway.

00:17:03.799 --> 00:17:05.599
I need to have the sense to come today too.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.019
We're roommates, after all.

00:17:07.519 --> 00:17:08.099
Old Li...

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:09.500
took the bait.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:18.859
What?

00:17:19.539 --> 00:17:20.480
That Xiao Long...

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.039
he already has a wife.

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.059
He's been married for three years.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.680
He's got a wife and kids all set.

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:26.880
What?

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:28.500
He even has kids?

00:17:28.599 --> 00:17:29.420
Two of them.

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:30.779
Old enough to run errands.

00:17:31.099 --> 00:17:31.740
Kids...

00:17:33.359 --> 00:17:33.920
Wait,

00:17:34.279 --> 00:17:36.319
didn't he say there was no love?

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.039
That doesn't stop him from having kids.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.119
What kind of person is he?

00:17:41.119 --> 00:17:42.019
I need to go have a word with him.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:43.339
Auntie Cai.

00:17:43.519 --> 00:17:44.759
What is there to say?

00:17:44.839 --> 00:17:46.799
It's not illegal to get married and have kids.

00:17:46.859 --> 00:17:47.460
True.

00:17:47.519 --> 00:17:49.940
We marry and have kids early back there.

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:50.680
Yes.

00:17:50.799 --> 00:17:52.980
But you shouldn't hide it, right?

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:54.920
Making me do all this work for nothing.

00:17:55.079 --> 00:17:56.380
In front of that Xiaofang,

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.279
I praised him to the skies.

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.660
Then let's pull back from the brink.

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:01.700
Better late than never.

00:18:01.759 --> 00:18:04.019
Just switch to praising A Jian to the skies.

00:18:04.079 --> 00:18:05.200
Won't that work?

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:06.200
Alright.

00:18:06.559 --> 00:18:07.240
I'll go right now.

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.500
Wait, I can't go yet.

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:10.519
Boss Li is hosting a feast.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.900
Professor Fan said I must go.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.299
He's so annoying.

00:18:14.299 --> 00:18:15.420
Treating me to dinner again.

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:19.799
Auntie Cai, take me with you.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:32.900
Thank you, Boss Li

00:18:33.119 --> 00:18:33.880
Thanks

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:34.539
Congratulations

00:18:34.539 --> 00:18:36.559
Congratulations to Boss Li on the writing fee

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.599
Fine, Old Fan. You're ruthless

00:18:39.059 --> 00:18:40.039
It is indeed worth celebrating

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:42.039
Thanks

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:42.980
The joy is mutual

00:18:45.779 --> 00:18:46.259
Let's order

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.440
Don't you worry about that

00:18:48.779 --> 00:18:50.900
Professor Fan has already ordered everything

00:18:53.039 --> 00:18:53.859
It's all ordered

00:18:54.359 --> 00:18:54.980
Good that it's ordered

00:18:56.599 --> 00:18:57.779
What exactly did you order?

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:58.720
A mix of meat and vegetables

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.900
We agreed to treat Ms. Liu

00:19:09.759 --> 00:19:10.420
and you

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:12.200
to a simple meal

00:19:12.579 --> 00:19:13.420
Good lord

00:19:14.599 --> 00:19:16.579
You've turned it into a year-end banquet

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:17.680
Look at this

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.579
Nearly three thousand

00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:22.160
I'm not the one who got the writing fee

00:19:23.339 --> 00:19:25.359
Should have just split the bill

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:28.420
Now you know the benefits of splitting the bill

00:19:30.339 --> 00:19:30.980
I can't

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.519
I need to go to the restroom

00:19:52.839 --> 00:19:54.539
Comrades, elders

00:19:54.839 --> 00:19:56.880
Everyone, please quiet down

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:58.519
Quiet down

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.759
Every chess game has different rules

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.880
Quiet down

00:20:05.079 --> 00:20:05.900
Quiet down

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:07.660
The leader is speaking

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:08.440
Hurry up

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.339
Make it quick

00:20:10.579 --> 00:20:11.799
Ladies and gentlemen

00:20:13.619 --> 00:20:15.660
Heavy rain, lots of mosquitoes

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:16.640
The sky is gonna...

00:20:17.299 --> 00:20:17.940
Took the wrong one

00:20:18.119 --> 00:20:19.220
There are mosquitoes

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:20.920
Unreliable

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:30.720
The spring breeze is rippling

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.960
A hundred flowers are blooming

00:20:32.099 --> 00:20:34.819
Old friends and new gather together

00:20:35.059 --> 00:20:35.940
These past few days

00:20:36.119 --> 00:20:38.079
On such a special day

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:39.559
Our Yangliu New Town

00:20:39.619 --> 00:20:41.160
The AA 2.0 Group

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.359
Is officially established

00:20:43.359 --> 00:20:44.160
Good

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:45.200
Wait, no

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:46.500
What group?

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:48.920
AA 2.0 Group

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:49.460
No

00:20:49.539 --> 00:20:51.440
What is AA?

00:20:51.539 --> 00:20:52.920
Why is it 2.0?

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:54.460
Okay

00:20:54.799 --> 00:20:56.660
Let me briefly explain to everyone

00:20:58.079 --> 00:21:00.099
As for AA 2.0

00:21:00.099 --> 00:21:02.079
This concept of AA

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:03.279
Is

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:04.279
Is a foreign import

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.380
What is a foreign import?

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:06.099
A ship?

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.400
A foreign import

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.579
It means imported

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:09.220
No

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:10.640
Who imported it?

00:21:11.119 --> 00:21:12.640
Where was it imported from?

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:13.819
Everyone, don't be chaotic

00:21:13.819 --> 00:21:14.299
Don't be chaotic

00:21:14.299 --> 00:21:15.079
Listen to me

00:21:15.599 --> 00:21:17.420
Why should we listen to you first?

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.500
Right, what do you do anyway?

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.180
No, you aren't...

00:21:20.319 --> 00:21:21.200
He is Boss Li

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.420
He's a leader

00:21:22.839 --> 00:21:24.440
Whose leader is he?

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.339
He used to be at the work unit

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.720
Darn it, now he's here

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:28.799
Responsible for... okay

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:30.400
I'm not messing around with you guys anymore

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.619
Quiet down, comrades

00:21:38.579 --> 00:21:39.440
Comrades

00:21:39.539 --> 00:21:40.859
I say, what is wrong with you?

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:41.960
You child

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.859
You don't agree to A Jian either?

00:21:45.059 --> 00:21:46.720
A Jian is such a good young man

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:47.519
Let me tell you

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:50.039
That kid is tall and handsome

00:21:50.059 --> 00:21:51.559
Makes a really great boyfriend

00:21:52.099 --> 00:21:53.500
Mouth not crooked, eyes not slanted

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:54.740
Doesn't limp at all when he walks

00:21:54.839 --> 00:21:56.740
The only drawback is

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.500
He's too excellent

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.700
Do you have anything fresh to say?

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:01.319
No more

00:22:02.819 --> 00:22:04.440
Just stop bothering

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.839
In my heart

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:09.799
There's been someone for a long time

00:22:11.359 --> 00:22:12.559
There's already someone

00:22:13.099 --> 00:22:14.599
Who? Do I know him?

00:22:15.599 --> 00:22:16.599
You...

00:22:18.339 --> 00:22:20.059
You definitely know him

00:22:20.339 --> 00:22:21.799
Who is it?

00:22:25.839 --> 00:22:26.799
Director Chang

00:22:26.799 --> 00:22:27.839
Director Chang!

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:29.019
You...

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.880
Don't shout!

00:22:32.519 --> 00:22:33.680
Director Chang!

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.140
Getting ready to distribute medicine?

00:22:38.319 --> 00:22:39.160
Hello, Auntie Cai

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:47.799
Is our Director Chang in?

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:48.720
He is

00:22:49.259 --> 00:22:50.039
Auntie Cai, is there something you need?

00:22:50.039 --> 00:22:51.579
How about I pass on a message for you?

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:52.900
No

00:22:53.039 --> 00:22:55.140
I better tell him this myself

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:11.700
What are you doing?

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:13.880
What are you trying to do?

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:15.920
I...

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.099
I'm not doing anything.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.339
It's just for Miss Xiaofang...

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.339
Impossible.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:21.940
Absolutely impossible.

00:23:23.579 --> 00:23:24.680
If you say it's impossible,

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:25.720
then forget it.

00:23:25.759 --> 00:23:26.259
I...

00:23:26.259 --> 00:23:27.240
I'll just go back then.

00:23:30.579 --> 00:23:31.400
I'm making a call.

00:23:33.839 --> 00:23:35.359
I will absolutely not agree.

00:23:35.359 --> 00:23:36.700
When Xiao Ming is this young,

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:37.660
taking him abroad.

00:23:39.339 --> 00:23:40.160
Yes,

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.099
we are divorced,

00:23:41.099 --> 00:23:42.519
but I am still the child's father!

00:23:43.859 --> 00:23:45.779
You are truly ridiculous.

00:23:45.779 --> 00:23:46.240
I...

00:23:48.299 --> 00:23:49.079
I'm telling you,

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:50.559
I cannot possibly allow my son

00:23:50.559 --> 00:23:52.500
to be a yellow-skinned, white-hearted Banana.

00:23:53.619 --> 00:23:54.720
Fine, we have nothing to discuss.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:55.819
Talk to my lawyer.

00:24:02.839 --> 00:24:03.400
Auntie Cai.

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:06.359
Um...

00:24:07.299 --> 00:24:08.539
Did you need me for something?

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:10.599
No.

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:11.460
No, wait.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:12.539
Didn't you just say...

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.180
something about Xiaofang?

00:24:15.519 --> 00:24:16.039
No.

00:24:16.599 --> 00:24:17.539
Xiaofang is fine.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:19.779
I'll go back and give her a harsh scolding.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.519
Make her stifle those wild thoughts.

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:23.799
Goodbye.
