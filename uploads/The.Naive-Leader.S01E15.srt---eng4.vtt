00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.790
A while back, the bandit gang robbed a few wealthy households

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.310
Including relatives of Commander Zhang

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.230
Now headquarters wants me to suppress bandits for the people

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.230
Gentlemen

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.040
Do you have any brilliant ideas?

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.790
Actually, this bandit gang isn't that formidable

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.950
It's just that they've fled to

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.680
the borders of Chen, Wei, and Liao to commit crimes

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.150
And are hiding deep in the mountains

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.150
Suppressing bandits is a thankless job

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.590
As the saying goes

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.840
When guns fire, it costs ten thousand taels of gold

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.000
It's simply using a cannon to shoot a fly

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.080
It costs too much

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.280
I think since

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.960
we are suppressing bandits for the people

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.120
we should take from the people and use it for the people

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.000
Levying a bandit suppression tax

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.310
is urgent

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.590
This monthly vegetarian gratitude meal

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.470
is to let everyone remember the people's suffering

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.840
Even bandits know to rob the rich and give to the poor

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.400
Yet we're adding taxes

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.030
If it were you

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.750
would you choose to join the army

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.430
or join the bandits?

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.190
Eat slowly, don't choke

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.840
Commander

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.400
The Lucky General has arrived

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.560
He's finally here

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.150
I haven't seen a shadow of him

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.240
Commander

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.120
Could this be my last meal?

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.750
I didn't lie to you

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.360
Everything I said is true

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.910
I've believed you all along

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.240
And I believe that Lucky General you mentioned

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.750
really has skills

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.630
He replaced Ma Laohu

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.520
He killed Ma Laohu

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.630
Come, let's have a drink

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.080
Commander, I remember...

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.840
...you suppressed Ma Laohu before, didn't you?

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.240
Yes, I did.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.630
But not completely.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.560
Ma Laohu ran rampant for years.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.160
The people were terrified of him.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.190
For a bandit gang to change so quickly...

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.680
...and win the people's hearts...

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.190
...this bandit leader has some tricks up his sleeve.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:34.870
This Lucky General you mentioned...

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.950
...he absorbed Ma Laohu's men.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.800
And formed a new force.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.680
Called the Brotherhood.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:40.920
Flying the "Fan" banner.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.600
Not only do they not rob the people...

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.040
...they distribute money and grain.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.270
They are very popular.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.310
Many people have run off to join him.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.750
He became a bandit?

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:50.830
That seems unlikely.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.950
I specifically had someone investigate.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.800
He crossed the river from Weiyuan.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.600
To run a hotpot business.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.270
And offended Commander Qin.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.800
It matches what was in your report...

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.070
...pretty closely.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.120
Staff Officer Huo.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.480
Is he the one...

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.190
...who drove you to a dead end?

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:08.160
Exactly.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.000
So, what kind of person is he?

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.720
This man...

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.560
...he doesn't play by the rules.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.390
But he always has some dumb luck.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.750
He looks a bit goofy and dumpy.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.000
He is the type who...

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.560
...looks foolish but is sharp as a tack.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.360
That's a talent.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.750
So I think...

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.560
...perhaps recruiting him...

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.190
...would be more useful than destroying him.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.310
Given your relationship with him...

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:38.830
...will there be any issues?

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.430
It's a sure thing.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.160
If...

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.190
...you go persuade him...

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:45.950
...to follow my lead...

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:47.190
...will that work?

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:48.920
If it is indeed the same person...

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.310
...it's ninety percent sure.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:51.870
I want one hundred percent.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.240
What if it's not the same person?

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.950
I don't care.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.270
You owe me a Lucky General.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.600
I'll assume it's the same person.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.870
Staff Officer Huo is good at guessing my thoughts.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:02.480
So...

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.630
...can you put aside your personal grudge?

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.830
Commander Chen's interests come first.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.600
It's just that this man...

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.560
...has a rebellious streak.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.160
To subdue him...

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:15.630
...I'm afraid it won't be that easy.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:17.160
It might...

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.950
...require a strategy like the Seven Captures of Meng Huo.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.360
Beat him into submission...

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:24.510
...only then might it work.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.510
Commander Qin.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.600
You've dealt with him before.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.600
Do you agree with what I say?

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.040
Well...

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.120
This man is indeed...

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.120
...very difficult to tame.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.720
Suppressing bandits is an order from above.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.480
This operation for Commander Chen...

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.800
...in front of the superiors...

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:47.560
...to establish prestige...

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.950
...is the best opportunity.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.950
If we fight...

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.120
...we need someone who knows him well.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:53.680
Know yourself and know your enemy...

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:55.870
...and you will never be defeated.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:57.240
Therefore...

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.720
Commander Qin and I...

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.510
...are willing to lead the troops.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.560
For Commander Chen...

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.510
...to recruit this useful talent.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.630
Good.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.830
Yes, sir.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:18.870
Nice, isn't it?

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:21.070
Wait a sec, let me tell the Boss.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:23.560
Win big.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:26.830
Congratulations, Brother.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.510
More and more people are coming up the mountain.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.600
There's no room left to sleep.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.950
I want to clear out the cave in the back.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.190
To settle these people down first.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:35.950
Okay, you arrange it.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:36.680
Alright.

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:38.070
Follow me, follow me.

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:42.870
Stop drinking.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:44.430
Drink some tea to sober up.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.360
Okay.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.000
Here.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:02.800
Here.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.510
Regiment Commander Qin.

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:12.950
Next time you should get a bigger sedan chair.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.070
Otherwise, no one can tell...

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:15.240
...who the commander-in-chief is.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:18.680
He's Division Commander Chen's favorite now.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.480
We just have to obediently follow orders.

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:22.510
Regiment Commander Qin.

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:24.480
How can you say that?

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.560
I'm here to create an opportunity for you.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.430
You're borrowing a knife to kill.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.870
Yes, I want that guy named Fan dead.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:33.240
Don't you want that too?

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.270
He beat you until your head was bloody.

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:37.720
The woman you had in your hands...

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.600
...was snatched right out of your bed by him.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.240
Can you swallow that insult?

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.080
My own scores...

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.120
...I know how to settle them myself.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.510
I don't need you to arrange things for me.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.390
I just want to remind you.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.550
You used to feed on the scraps from my chin.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.870
Don't think about climbing over my head.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.270
Regiment Commander Qin.

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:57.120
We have a common enemy.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.550
We wear the same pair of pants.

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:00.390
What's the need to distinguish high from low?

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.200
Well said.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.390
Then let me give you a piece of advice.

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:07.960
The faster you climb, the harder you fall.

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:09.080
Move faster.

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:11.600
Staff Officer Huo.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.550
It's safer to walk in the back.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:15.510
Guns and cannons don't have eyes.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.000
We're hitting hard this time.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.750
Wouldn't want to kill bandits but scare the Staff Officer...

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:22.000
...that wouldn't be good.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.200
Then I'll trouble you, Regiment Commander Qin.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:28.390
What?

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:30.390
Brother Fan! Bad news! Fighting has started!

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.360
Brother! The government troops are attacking!

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:33.200
Go!

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.320
Go!

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:37.360
Go!

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:13.790
Go!

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:14.910
Brother!

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:16.870
We can't hold them! Go!

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:17.870
Go!

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:20.630
Go!

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:21.840
Go!

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.200
Go!

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:30.790
Brother, go!

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.510
Vicious bandits have appeared.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.840
Robbing homes, attacking merchant caravans.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.670
Burning, killing, and looting.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.910
To maintain public order...

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:08.270
...our army has dispatched troops...

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.240
...to strike hard against the mountain bandits.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:13.080
The bandits are still on the run.

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:16.270
They are armed...

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:17.870
...and extremely dangerous.

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:23.200
Looks like they're serious about suppressing bandits this time.

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:24.870
Fan Gezi's bandits...

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.120
...haven't done anything bad.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:26.910
And they're still suppressing them?

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:28.840
They rob the rich, of course they'll be suppressed.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.960
Officials and merchants are in cahoots, you know.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:32.720
Looks like this time...

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.080
...they might not get away.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.960
They have Zhongjiang Hollow Noodles here too?

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:51.910
Five bowls.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.360
Keep it down.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:55.120
Bring us five bowls.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:57.840
Gentlemen.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.080
Sit inside, sit inside.

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:01.480
Keep it down. Bring us five bowls.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.150
Alright. Five bowls coming up.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:15.440
Three a bowl

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:18.030
Five bowls, ten coppers

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:21.840
Pay up

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:25.750
Pay up

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:31.720
Money

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.480
Did you bring any money?

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.240
Left in a rush, didn't bring any

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:41.000
No money, huh?

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.240
You trying to freeload?

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:45.630
Put it on my tab

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:47.390
I'll bring you the money when I have it

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:48.440
Who are you, anyway?

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.510
Why should I let you have a tab?

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.150
Pay me

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.120
You're not leaving until you pay

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.080
What?

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:57.150
I'm running a small business here

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:58.440
In broad daylight...

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.320
Are you worse than bandits?

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.030
Keep it down, keep it down

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.670
I am the bandit leader

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:05.840
You know that, right?

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:07.910
I've done a lot of good deeds

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:09.960
Who are you kidding?

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:11.240
If you're the bandit leader

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.200
I'd give you my whole stall

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:14.960
Everyone, come look!

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:17.030
He claims he's the bandit leader!

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:19.270
A bandit leader freeloading!

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:20.510
Stop shouting

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:21.550
Oh no, the soldiers are here

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:22.550
Go, go, go. Move

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.080
You can't leave

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:25.360
Let go

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:28.000
Bandit!

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.510
Bandit leader!

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:30.720
The bandit leader is freeloading!

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:36.510
Over here

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:44.030
Brother

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:45.670
Did you see some men run past just now?

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:47.080
No. Take this and search

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.750
Then they must be in here. Let's go

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:25.440
Good

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:36.750
Xiaoqing

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:40.910
My Lady

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:47.120
This way, this way

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:51.790
Trouble

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.150
Trouble, trouble, trouble

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:54.670
There's no back door

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:56.120
Darn it

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:58.440
They chase us around all day, running us ragged

00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:59.510
I've had enough

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.910
Let's just go out and fight them to the death

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:03.390
Right, fight them to the death

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:04.510
I support you

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:05.600
Are you two idiots?

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.030
How can we fight with just a few of us?

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:07.630
Darn it

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.240
What?

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.360
It's all your fault

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.480
Ever since Yuzhen left

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:16.840
You've been like a lost soul

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:18.790
The brothers haven't touched guns in ages

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:20.000
How can we win?

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:20.910
Master Wen

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.550
It really is you

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.200
Brother Fan, why are you here?

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.550
It's a long story

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.480
Those soldiers downstairs

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:29.000
They're chasing you?

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.840
I want to use this precious place

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.030
To hide for a bit

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:33.790
All right

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.720
Don't panic, we're performing "The Flooding of Golden Mountain"

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.510
You know it, just improvise

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.910
Later, go out the door and turn right

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:45.670
There's a river

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.870
You can swim out of Xinglong Town

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:47.840
Leading to Chengdu Prefecture

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.630
Got it

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.510
Officers, what can I do for you?

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:53.480
Catching wanted criminals

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:55.550
We only have our troupe members here

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:57.270
How could there be wanted criminals?

00:15:57.750 --> 00:15:59.750
Come, if you want to search, go this way

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:00.480
Take a look

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:01.720
See if the person you want is here

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:03.550
Look carefully

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:05.240
Report, Captain

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:07.960
Today is Mayor Wang's father-in-law's big birthday

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.030
He's down there watching the play

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:10.150
We can't afford to offend him

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:11.960
Don't say *you* can't afford to offend him

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:13.630
*I* can't afford to offend him either

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.630
If we can't offend him, why are you still standing there?

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.030
Withdraw

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.510
On stage, on stage

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.320
Hurry up, get on stage

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:24.270
Okay

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:25.630
Quick, quick

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.030
Coming, coming, coming

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.870
Good

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.000
Master

00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:19.960
The water has flooded the mountain gate

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.270
Good

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.030
Good

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:48.790
I'm going in

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:58.000
I'll go down and take a look

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.160
It's too late, Brother, go quickly

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.200
Go quickly

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:03.480
It's too late, go

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.400
Go, hurry

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.480
Stumbled and crawled all the way to Chengdu,

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:34.030
living worse than a beggar.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.510
Wanting to shed this bandit skin

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.550
isn't going to be that easy.

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:48.590
Are you hungry?

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.240
Hungry.

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:50.200
I wasn't asking you.

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:53.030
Do you want to eat meat?

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:53.960
Yes.

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:54.550
Yes.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:00.350
Follow me.

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:08.590
Let's go, let's go.

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:09.240
What's going on?

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.160
Get out, get out.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.240
Get out, get out, get out.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.000
Get out.

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:13.550
You don't even have money,

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:14.550
yet you come here to scam a meal?

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.480
And pretend to be our boss's master.

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:19.000
He really is the master of all your bosses.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:21.830
Then I'm your great-grandmaster.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:22.400
You...

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:23.720
Fine, fine, fine.

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.920
Say no more.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:26.270
Xiugu.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.160
Let's prove it to him.

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.030
Eat him poor, eat him poor.

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:32.880
Eat the boss out of house and home.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.680
Eat him poor, eat him poor.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:35.750
Eat the boss out of house and home.

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:36.270
Stop, stop, stop.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.720
Everyone in Chengdu knows this act.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:39.510
Do another one.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.510
Perform well and I'll give you a bite to eat.

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:42.830
Can't you speak properly?

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.200
Believe it or not, I'll beat you up.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:47.750
Let's go, let's go.

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:53.720
Drive out the Japanese, defend Chengdu!

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:05.510
Drive out the Japanese, defend Chengdu!

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:08.880
Drive out the Japanese, defend Chengdu!

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:10.680
Compatriots!

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.110
Do not be deceived by the Japanese's

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:13.310
sweet words.

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:15.830
Today they open a consulate in Chengdu,

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:18.310
tomorrow they can station troops in Chengdu.

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:20.590
This is a naked act of aggression.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.110
The Japanese invaders have already occupied our three Northeast provinces.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.400
We cannot let them enter our Chengdu,

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:26.790
our homeland.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.350
We must defend it to the death!

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.920
Punish traitors severely, expel Japanese invaders!

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.480
Drive out the Japanese!

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:35.510
The Japanese have made their way here.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:36.640
Compatriots, wake up!

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:37.680
Those few Japanese people

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.310
are currently at the Longxing Hotel.

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:40.920
We must unite as one

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:42.200
and stop their conspiracy.

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:43.920
Compatriots, come with me!

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:46.750
Drive out the Japanese, defend Chengdu!

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.590
Drive out the Japanese, defend Chengdu!

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:52.440
Drive out the Japanese, defend Chengdu!

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:55.270
Drive out the Japanese, defend Chengdu!

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:58.750
The Sichuanese don't seem very obedient.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.510
They can't change anything.

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.070
As soon as the consulate location is confirmed,

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:06.160
construction can start immediately.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.000
Drive out the Japanese, defend Chengdu!

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:12.160
Drive out the Japanese, defend Chengdu!

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.110
Drive out the Japanese, defend Chengdu!

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:18.000
Drive out the Japanese, defend Chengdu!

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:19.070
Compatriots!

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:20.920
The Japanese are right here!

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.640
If you're a man, charge with me!

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:27.000
Laoyao, you look after Xiugu.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.030
We're going in.

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:39.510
Get out here! Get out here!

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:41.160
Get out here! Get out here!

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:41.920
Move aside!

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.680
Let's break the door down!

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:45.350
Yeah!

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:47.510
One, two, three!

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:55.110
Don't you come any closer!

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:56.640
This behavior of yours...

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:58.750
...is completely destroying the peace!

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.440
Your government wants to befriend us!

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.070
You are making trouble out of nothing!

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.030
Please, all of you, leave! Get out!

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:07.720
You're the ones who should get out!

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.960
Get out! Get out!

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:12.440
What?

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:15.310
Showing off your blade before Lord Guan?

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.480
Come on! Chop right here!

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:18.400
Go ahead, chop!

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:20.270
Come on! Come on!

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.270
The Japanese jumped down!

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:31.070
He jumped! He jumped!

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:32.240
Scarface!

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:33.270
Let's go!

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:34.400
You Japanese...

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:38.160
You'll never get away!

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:44.830
What are you doing? What do you want?

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.240
Trespassing and rioting are felonies!

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:50.400
Everyone...

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.030
Break it up! Break it up!

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:53.480
Break it up!

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:56.400
Move it, move it! Go, go!

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:57.640
Break it up! Break it up!

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:58.550
I'll kill you!

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.240
Stop hitting him!

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:03.480
You won't get away with murder!

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.200
Go!

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.550
Hit him! Hit him!

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:11.550
Stop! Catch him!

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:17.590
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.110
Stay away from me!

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:20.750
I am your guest!

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.400
The Nanjing government invited me here!

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.400
Invited you, my ass!

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.000
Invited you here...

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:28.960
...to occupy our land?

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:31.310
Kill him!

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:34.790
Kill him! Kill him!

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:10.000
Are you alright?

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.070
Good! A hero!

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.590
Hero!

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:16.960
What? What? What's going on?

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.510
No gathering! No trouble-making!

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:24.880
I'll say it one more time!

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:26.960
No gathering! No trouble-making!

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:27.790
Clear out, everyone!

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.240
Move along! Move along!

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.030
Why are you still standing there like a log?

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.480
Waiting for me to give you a medal?

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:37.160
Hurry up and go!

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.400
Alright, Officer. Let's go.

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:40.160
Halt!

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.270
You killed him.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:47.070
They can't leave.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:48.750
Who are you?

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.920
Don't obstruct police business.

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.920
I am the Nanjing Government's Special Commissioner in Chengdu.

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:56.480
Whoever lets the murderer go...

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:58.000
...is guilty of the same crime!

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.270
If the Commissioner hadn't reported it...

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:06.720
...how long would you have kept it from me?

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:08.270
Yes, yes, yes.

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.000
I am investigating with all my effort.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.920
I've heard the Sichuan clique is full of infighting.

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:16.110
And lax in management.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.110
I didn't expect such a huge incident.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.240
If you ask me...

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.400
...it's time for a cleanup.

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:25.160
The Northeast fell first.

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:27.200
The people of Chengdu...

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.590
...fear following in those footsteps.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.030
Emotions are bound to be a bit high.

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:35.160
At the time, the military and police acted together.

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:37.960
And have controlled the situation.

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:40.030
This matter...

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.070
...concerns the relations between two nations.

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.000
You must provide a proper explanation.

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:18.070
Hello.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:19.240
Is that Commander Liu?

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:21.510
Let me tell you,

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.880
the folks over in Chengdu

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:26.160
have real guts and temper.

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:28.350
It's pure Sichuan style.

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:30.350
Commander Zhang,

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.880
don't you come adding to the mess.

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.110
It was a good kill.

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:36.030
A damn good kill!

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:37.510
If I were there,

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:39.270
I would've beaten him too.

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.720
You're just watching the fire from safety.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.240
Easy for you to say.

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.790
You've dominated Bashu for decades,

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:50.790
what storms haven't you seen?

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:52.790
Naturally, you can channel water to fight the fire.

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:54.400
I'll put my words right here.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.440
In the face of national righteousness,

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:57.590
whenever needed,

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:00.510
I'm absolutely of one heart with Commander Liu.

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:04.680
You son of a bitch, those words

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.480
actually sound pleasant to my ears.

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:14.160
Mr. Tanaka.

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:15.400
Where is Commander Liu?

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:17.310
Our Commander Liu is really in a bad way.

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:18.440
He can't make it today.

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:19.510
He just went to the hospital.

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:21.830
Yesterday he had diarrhea.

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:23.070
Today he's hospitalized.

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.750
Commander Liu is playing tricks.

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.960
Commander Liu really did have diarrhea yesterday,

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:29.270
which then caused gastroenteritis.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:30.830
He also drank some unclean water,

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:32.400
triggering his old ailment.

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.920
However, Commander Liu specifically instructed me

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.790
to pass a message to Mr. Tanaka.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.720
He hopes you will wait patiently.

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:40.070
Wait for three to five months,

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.750
when our Commander Liu recovers,

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:43.030
he will certainly welcome you properly.

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:44.750
Wait three to five months?

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.960
My side demands

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:47.590
immediate and severe punishment for the murderer.

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:50.640
But your government delays again and again.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.160
It has already made the relations

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:53.750
between our two countries very tense.

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:56.070
If you don't provide a reasonable explanation,

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:58.070
the consequences will be serious.

00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.070
Ambassador Tanaka,

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.110
compensation was paid, and the man was caught.

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:03.880
Exactly.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.720
We have our own difficulties too.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.030
Those bold unruly citizens

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:10.440
incited the deceived commoners

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:12.830
and smashed up our police station.

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:14.590
As the saying goes,

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.590
water can carry a boat, but can also overturn it.

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:20.310
If we don't control and appease the people,

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:23.240
how would we have time to handle your matter?

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:24.680
Besides,

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:27.310
hasn't the criminal already been locked up?

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:30.160
During his illness, Commander Liu

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.880
has been constantly concerned about this.

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:33.550
He reminded us repeatedly,

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.070
since it concerns relations between the two countries,

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:37.200
we must investigate the matter clearly.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:38.920
We are currently also

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:40.920
worrying about finding eyewitnesses.

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:42.920
We cannot let a bad person go,

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:44.790
but we can't wrong a good person either.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.270
Drive out the Japanese!

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:47.830
Release the anti-Japanese hero!

00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:49.000
Drive out the Japanese!

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.640
Release the anti-Japanese hero!

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.000
Look, Mr. Tanaka.

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.160
They've made a scene all the way to City Hall.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.750
The most important thing now is safety.

00:30:58.030 --> 00:30:59.720
I want you to give a reasonable explanation.

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:01.720
You must not act on impulse.

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:03.680
It's not too late to leave now.

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:04.590
If you don't leave,

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:08.000
I'm afraid we won't be able to control this situation.

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.880
Release the anti-Japanese hero! Drive out the Japanese!

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.790
Release the anti-Japanese hero! Drive out the Japanese!

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:16.880
Release the anti-Japanese hero! Drive out the Japanese!

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:18.830
Release the anti-Japanese hero!

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:22.200
Dragging it on like this

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:23.920
is probably not a solution.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.480
Whether to kill or protect him is troublesome.

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:31.030
The wind is rising before the coming storm.

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:33.110
The Nanjing side has also given Commander Liu

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:34.640
no fewer than ten calls.

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:37.480
As for Commander Liu's intention...

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.880
it's hard to guess.
