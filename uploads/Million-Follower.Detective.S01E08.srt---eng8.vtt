WEBVTT

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.166
WITCH BABA

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.083
There's another killer.

00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.708
One more person is going to die.

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:16.250
Hey… Hurry!

00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:17.875
It's gonna hit me in the head!

00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:19.250
Fuck you.

00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:22.208
We're running out. Shit.

00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:23.375
-Running out?
-Yeah.

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:26.083
-Light the big one!
-Hurry up! It hit me!

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:28.291
-So aggressive.
-Light the big one.

00:01:28.375 --> 00:01:29.875
Get his head!

00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.083
Shit!

00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:36.500
The video…

00:01:38.875 --> 00:01:39.708
isn't finished.

00:01:40.583 --> 00:01:41.416
Shit.

00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:44.250
Fuck, you're awake?

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:45.958
You're awake?

00:01:46.791 --> 00:01:49.291
Shit, you were asleep for so long!

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:50.375
Lower your voice.

00:01:51.083 --> 00:01:52.375
I'm sorry…

00:01:52.458 --> 00:01:54.458
Fuck, you were asleep for so long.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.125
Are you okay?

00:01:57.208 --> 00:01:58.583
I wasn't asleep.

00:01:59.291 --> 00:02:00.708
I heard what you were doing.

00:02:01.583 --> 00:02:02.625
What the heck?

00:02:02.708 --> 00:02:03.958
What did you hear?

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:06.625
That video…

00:02:07.708 --> 00:02:09.041
There's more after that.

00:02:15.291 --> 00:02:16.791
The online video

00:02:17.625 --> 00:02:18.583
has been edited.

00:02:20.416 --> 00:02:21.708
We're running out. Shit.

00:02:21.791 --> 00:02:23.416
-Running out?
-Light the big one.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.916
Hurry up! It hit me!

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.875
-So aggressive.
-Light the big one.

00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.041
Get his head!

00:02:29.125 --> 00:02:30.875
I think we should tell the cops.

00:02:33.208 --> 00:02:35.000
The cops won't believe you.

00:02:40.375 --> 00:02:41.416
This one will.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.500
CALLING CHEN CHIA-JEN

00:04:01.458 --> 00:04:02.291
Mr. Jen.

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:05.416
I just checked with the telecom provider.

00:04:06.125 --> 00:04:09.958
Wei Yen's video
was definitely uploaded in RS E-Sports.

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:13.458
Too bad the surveillance cameras
didn't get the uploader's face.

00:04:13.541 --> 00:04:14.708
The odd thing is,

00:04:15.583 --> 00:04:19.166
If Kuo Ta-fu uploaded this video,
why did he edit out the ending?

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.541
Wei Yen obviously…

00:04:23.208 --> 00:04:25.708
No one else knows about this besides me?

00:04:26.583 --> 00:04:28.541
No. You told me not to tell anyone.

00:04:29.333 --> 00:04:33.291
Only his family, Ting-yu, and us
know Wei Yen woke up.

00:04:33.375 --> 00:04:36.000
Mr. Hua took over
as the guard officer too.

00:04:36.083 --> 00:04:37.041
But…

00:04:37.541 --> 00:04:39.000
I have a question.

00:04:39.083 --> 00:04:39.916
Yes?

00:04:41.083 --> 00:04:43.416
Mr. Jen, why did you ask to meet here?

00:04:45.416 --> 00:04:46.625
It's nice here.

00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:49.041
Do you really like pink?

00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:52.041
It's about the vibe.

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:54.041
I feel comfortable.

00:04:55.166 --> 00:04:57.291
Well, did you bring the file?

00:04:57.375 --> 00:04:58.750
I did, but…

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:01.250
It's broken.

00:05:01.833 --> 00:05:03.416
Broken? Can't you fix it?

00:05:05.208 --> 00:05:06.833
It's physically damaged.

00:05:10.666 --> 00:05:13.166
I believe one of our guys did it.

00:05:14.416 --> 00:05:15.250
Yeah.

00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:18.500
In 2021,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.291
May 18th,

00:05:20.375 --> 00:05:23.666
aside from Kuo Ta-fu's car accident,
there was another incident.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.333
Someone took drugs, overdosed, and died.

00:05:26.416 --> 00:05:28.083
These two incidents happened

00:05:28.166 --> 00:05:30.291
less than 50 meters apart.

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:36.250
The deceased's name was Chao Kuo-an.

00:05:36.916 --> 00:05:38.291
I checked the computer.

00:05:38.375 --> 00:05:40.666
Chao Kuo-an's file
is tagged as confidential.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:41.833
I couldn't access it.

00:05:41.916 --> 00:05:42.791
ACCESS DENIED

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:44.916
The traffic accident report

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.208
was also unclear.

00:05:49.583 --> 00:05:52.333
You know, I don't like using computers.

00:05:53.375 --> 00:05:54.833
Did you know our precinct

00:05:54.916 --> 00:05:56.916
has a file room on B2?

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.291
FILE ROOM

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.208
Aside from me,

00:06:01.875 --> 00:06:03.541
I'm sure no one knows about it.

00:06:05.916 --> 00:06:07.875
I found this.

00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.916
Kuo Ta-fu said, in this accident,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.083
his front tire hit a fire hydrant.

00:06:16.333 --> 00:06:18.416
But it was his rear tire that blew out.

00:06:21.583 --> 00:06:24.541
The officer at the scene
wrote in the initial report

00:06:24.625 --> 00:06:27.458
that he suspected the rear tire blew out…

00:06:37.541 --> 00:06:39.166
because of

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.458
a gunshot.

00:06:42.791 --> 00:06:45.416
REAR TIRE LIKELY PUNCTURED BY A GUNSHOT

00:06:46.291 --> 00:06:47.416
So…

00:06:47.916 --> 00:06:51.083
You suspect someone fired a gun?

00:06:51.708 --> 00:06:52.791
I have no proof.

00:06:52.875 --> 00:06:54.916
It's just a gut feeling.

00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:59.125
So, I hope you guys can help me with this.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.708
WITCH BABA

00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:20.500
Even though the serial killing case
seems over,

00:07:20.583 --> 00:07:23.625
there's actually another killer.

00:07:23.708 --> 00:07:26.375
One more person is going to die.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:33.666
Thank you all for coming.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.125
What I'm about to say

00:07:35.208 --> 00:07:38.333
concerns my life, Ting-yu's, Wei Yen's,

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:40.291
and Officer Chen Chia-jen's.

00:07:40.375 --> 00:07:42.583
Please keep this between us.

00:07:42.666 --> 00:07:45.250
This serial killing case isn't over yet.

00:07:45.333 --> 00:07:47.041
There's another killer.

00:07:47.125 --> 00:07:48.500
One more person will die.

00:07:48.583 --> 00:07:51.583
Next, please help spread the word

00:07:51.666 --> 00:07:54.333
that Wei Yen
knows the truth about the case.

00:07:54.416 --> 00:07:56.958
We're tricking the killer
into going after Wei Yen.

00:07:57.041 --> 00:07:58.333
Isn't that dangerous?

00:07:58.916 --> 00:08:00.625
What happens to Wei Yen, then?

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.125
About that, actually…

00:08:08.041 --> 00:08:09.375
Is everyone ready?

00:08:10.833 --> 00:08:12.375
Let me introduce

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.833
Wei Fa Yen.

00:08:15.916 --> 00:08:18.583
-Hello, guys, I'm Wei Yen.
-Wei Yen, you're alive?

00:08:18.666 --> 00:08:20.625
-I missed you!
-That's wild!

00:08:20.708 --> 00:08:21.541
You didn't die?

00:08:23.458 --> 00:08:25.041
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

00:08:26.666 --> 00:08:28.708
We've been waiting
for the killer to slip up.

00:08:28.791 --> 00:08:30.666
So please keep this between us.

00:08:31.333 --> 00:08:35.291
This is the million-follower influencers'
secret plan to rally millions of fans.

00:08:35.375 --> 00:08:37.791
This killer is extremely skilled.

00:08:37.875 --> 00:08:40.375
So, we need everyone's help.

00:08:40.458 --> 00:08:43.583
The serial killer
targeting influencers, Kuo Ta-fu,

00:08:43.666 --> 00:08:45.041
had just been arrested.

00:08:45.125 --> 00:08:47.708
He committed suicide while in custody.

00:08:47.791 --> 00:08:49.166
This series of incidents

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:51.750
must be caused
by someone targeting influencers.

00:08:51.833 --> 00:08:53.333
I don't mean Kuo Ta-fu.

00:08:53.416 --> 00:08:55.583
More people online are recalling

00:08:55.666 --> 00:08:57.041
what happened that night.

00:08:57.125 --> 00:08:57.958
Gunshot.

00:08:58.791 --> 00:09:00.833
That's so weird.

00:09:00.916 --> 00:09:02.333
Fireworks and gunshots.

00:09:03.791 --> 00:09:04.625
And gunshots?

00:09:05.416 --> 00:09:06.333
Totally different.

00:09:06.416 --> 00:09:08.791
Something else
must've happened that night.

00:09:08.875 --> 00:09:10.250
Ting-yu doesn't remember.

00:09:10.333 --> 00:09:11.625
What about Wei Yen?

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.750
Later, guys.

00:09:23.666 --> 00:09:26.750
WEI YEN IS RECOVERING WELL
HE SHOULD WAKE UP SOON

00:09:26.833 --> 00:09:28.458
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT IDEA?

00:09:28.541 --> 00:09:31.416
I'M WEI YEN'S NURSE

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.916
THE FLUID IN HIS LUNGS HAS BEEN CLEARED

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.458
THE DOCTORS SAY
HE COULD WAKE UP ANY TIME NOW

00:10:39.666 --> 00:10:42.291
A YEAR AGO

00:10:50.708 --> 00:10:52.000
Thanks.

00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:08.333
One-thirty.

00:11:08.416 --> 00:11:09.958
Linsen Golden Capital.

00:11:10.583 --> 00:11:11.791
At least three kilos.

00:11:45.833 --> 00:11:47.500
Shouldn't you get off now?

00:11:50.916 --> 00:11:52.750
Three kilos, man.

00:11:52.833 --> 00:11:53.916
Three kilograms.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.083
Just two bags.

00:11:56.166 --> 00:11:57.583
That's too little.

00:12:00.916 --> 00:12:02.875
I heard you got promoted to squad leader.

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.333
High-Tech Crime Unit squad leader,

00:12:09.416 --> 00:12:10.625
Ho Chen-wei.

00:12:11.708 --> 00:12:12.875
What do you want?

00:12:14.791 --> 00:12:17.166
Did you get promoted
in the High-Tech Crime Unit

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:18.708
through this?

00:12:20.875 --> 00:12:24.708
-Do you have a death wish?
-Okay. Don't be mad…

00:12:24.791 --> 00:12:27.916
I'm sorry, squad leader. My bad.

00:12:28.625 --> 00:12:30.041
Alright, I'll get going.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.000
-What's this?
-Hey.

00:12:32.083 --> 00:12:33.666
-What's this?
-Don't take it. Fuck!

00:12:34.291 --> 00:12:35.125
Stop!

00:12:36.875 --> 00:12:37.750
Stop!

00:12:43.291 --> 00:12:44.125
Stop!

00:13:02.833 --> 00:13:04.083
Fuck you.

00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:13.083
This is ridiculous.

00:13:13.166 --> 00:13:14.583
NO UNAUTHORIZED VEHICLES

00:13:14.666 --> 00:13:15.500
Stop!

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:18.250
Stop running.

00:13:23.916 --> 00:13:25.833
-Fuck.
-What the heck?

00:13:25.916 --> 00:13:26.750
Fuck.

00:13:27.583 --> 00:13:30.083
Stop running.

00:13:30.166 --> 00:13:32.458
You wanna mess with me? You recorded me?

00:13:32.541 --> 00:13:33.666
Fuck.

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:35.166
I didn't.

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:37.333
-What do we do?
-What now?

00:13:38.041 --> 00:13:39.333
Fuck, get down!

00:13:39.416 --> 00:13:40.250
Let's go.

00:13:40.333 --> 00:13:41.750
-Hey, let's go.
-Fuck.

00:13:41.833 --> 00:13:43.500
-Let's go.
-Do we call the police?

00:13:43.583 --> 00:13:44.791
-It won't start.
-Go!

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.666
-Ting-yu, go!
-Let's go!

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:48.375
-Let's go!
-Come on!

00:13:48.458 --> 00:13:49.458
Give me your phone!

00:13:49.541 --> 00:13:50.458
I didn't do it.

00:13:50.541 --> 00:13:53.625
You didn't? Give it to me!

00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:54.875
Are you okay?

00:13:56.166 --> 00:13:57.416
My water…

00:13:58.208 --> 00:13:59.958
I think my water broke.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:01.791
Hang in there.

00:14:01.875 --> 00:14:03.291
We're going to the hospital.

00:14:03.375 --> 00:14:04.666
-Fuck.
-I didn't do it.

00:14:05.583 --> 00:14:07.166
You fucking recorded me.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:12.500
Chao Kuo-an!

00:14:36.166 --> 00:14:37.083
Get in here.

00:14:40.916 --> 00:14:42.166
Keep it down.

00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:00.791
Honey.

00:15:10.916 --> 00:15:13.541
I said keep it the fuck down!

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:17.291
Please! Help!

00:15:18.666 --> 00:15:20.541
-Keep it down.
-Is anyone there?

00:15:21.875 --> 00:15:23.500
Help!

00:15:26.541 --> 00:15:28.208
Is anyone there?

00:15:28.291 --> 00:15:29.833
Help!

00:15:31.333 --> 00:15:32.333
Help!

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:53.083
Chao Kuo-an.

00:15:53.166 --> 00:15:54.125
Chao Kuo-an.

00:15:54.916 --> 00:15:56.541
Is anyone there?

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.250
CID AGENT

00:16:43.333 --> 00:16:44.791
-Mr. Hua.
-Yes.

00:16:44.875 --> 00:16:47.291
Patrol this intersection
and the next one again.

00:16:47.375 --> 00:16:48.750
Okay, got it.

00:16:52.375 --> 00:16:53.208
A-Hua.

00:16:54.083 --> 00:16:55.916
-Mr. Chen-wei.
-What's the situation?

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.166
Someone reported a corpse.

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:00.583
When we arrived,
he showed no signs of life.

00:17:01.083 --> 00:17:03.125
Looks like a drug overdose.

00:17:03.625 --> 00:17:04.916
The deceased is…

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:07.333
Chao Kuo-an,

00:17:07.833 --> 00:17:08.916
your informant.

00:17:09.458 --> 00:17:10.500
Chao Kuo-an?

00:17:14.625 --> 00:17:15.750
Damn it.

00:17:16.333 --> 00:17:18.291
I told him to quit,
but he wouldn't listen.

00:17:18.375 --> 00:17:19.916
I knew this would happen.

00:17:24.416 --> 00:17:26.291
Mr. Chen-wei, what do you want to do?

00:17:29.708 --> 00:17:30.625
Report the death.

00:17:30.708 --> 00:17:32.041
Report directly…

00:17:34.875 --> 00:17:37.041
We've been closing in on a supplier.

00:17:37.708 --> 00:17:39.208
Chao Kuo-an was our contact.

00:17:39.291 --> 00:17:41.708
Losing him will affect the operation.

00:17:41.791 --> 00:17:42.791
We can't alert them.

00:17:43.708 --> 00:17:45.125
But the higher-ups want…

00:17:45.208 --> 00:17:46.333
I'll handle the rest.

00:17:47.541 --> 00:17:48.416
Let's go.

00:18:02.833 --> 00:18:04.083
What happened over there?

00:18:05.375 --> 00:18:07.833
A car accident. Traffic's already on it.

00:18:09.625 --> 00:18:10.541
I'll take a look.

00:18:11.166 --> 00:18:12.000
Thank you.

00:18:12.083 --> 00:18:12.916
Yes.

00:18:20.916 --> 00:18:21.916
High-Tech Crime Unit

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:23.375
What?

00:18:24.041 --> 00:18:26.250
Ho Chen-wei,
High-Tech Crime Unit squad leader.

00:18:26.333 --> 00:18:27.583
Hello, sir.

00:18:27.666 --> 00:18:28.750
What's the situation?

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:30.958
Rear tire blew, flipped. No suspect.

00:18:32.291 --> 00:18:33.750
Any witnesses?

00:18:33.833 --> 00:18:34.958
No witnesses.

00:18:35.041 --> 00:18:35.875
But sir,

00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:37.375
the blowout is strange.

00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:39.000
Strange?

00:18:39.083 --> 00:18:40.875
Yes, I suspect it was a gunshot.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:42.500
A gunshot?

00:18:42.583 --> 00:18:44.541
Yes. I'm not sure, but look at the--

00:18:44.625 --> 00:18:47.125
You're not sure,
and you're putting it in the report?

00:18:47.208 --> 00:18:48.208
I'm sorry, sir.

00:18:50.125 --> 00:18:51.458
Any surveillance footage?

00:18:51.541 --> 00:18:52.583
What?

00:18:53.375 --> 00:18:55.833
Have you checked the three nearby cameras?

00:18:55.916 --> 00:18:58.750
Yes, we've requested the footage
from the local station.

00:19:00.375 --> 00:19:01.916
What about the one in front?

00:19:02.666 --> 00:19:04.750
Sir, that belongs to a private company.

00:19:06.208 --> 00:19:07.291
Got it.

00:19:07.375 --> 00:19:08.791
We'll take it from here.

00:19:08.875 --> 00:19:09.708
But we already--

00:19:09.791 --> 00:19:13.833
Our unit will collect the evidence.
Just tow the car and process it. Got it?

00:19:14.416 --> 00:19:15.250
Yes.

00:20:16.041 --> 00:20:18.166
Chia-jen, you're also an influencer now.

00:20:21.875 --> 00:20:24.708
They think you're a killer.
We need to handle this carefully.

00:20:24.791 --> 00:20:26.291
I fired lawfully.

00:20:28.208 --> 00:20:29.958
…and stopped in the lower left lung.

00:20:30.041 --> 00:20:31.916
Luckily, his heart wasn't damaged.

00:20:32.625 --> 00:20:34.250
We removed the bullet as well.

00:20:34.333 --> 00:20:35.416
Help!

00:20:36.125 --> 00:20:37.750
Is anyone there?

00:20:38.458 --> 00:20:39.875
You're that cop.

00:20:39.958 --> 00:20:40.791
Stay back.

00:20:40.875 --> 00:20:42.333
Are toy guns against the law?

00:20:42.416 --> 00:20:43.541
-Please?
-Stay back.

00:20:43.625 --> 00:20:45.833
Is killing fun for you?

00:20:45.916 --> 00:20:47.583
Let me introduce him.

00:20:47.666 --> 00:20:49.958
This is the killer cop.

00:20:50.041 --> 00:20:51.333
What's his name?

00:20:58.583 --> 00:21:00.083
Are you Wei Meng-yen's family?

00:21:00.625 --> 00:21:01.458
Yes.

00:21:01.541 --> 00:21:04.041
I'm Ho Chen-wei,
High-Tech Crime Unit squad leader.

00:21:04.125 --> 00:21:05.833
I want to check Meng-yen's phone.

00:21:06.333 --> 00:21:07.166
I've told you--

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:08.250
Here's the warrant.

00:21:08.333 --> 00:21:09.708
Shall I search your house?

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:12.500
Officer, wait.

00:21:13.375 --> 00:21:16.125
-You guys shot my son.
-The case has expanded.

00:21:16.208 --> 00:21:18.750
We need to seize
all of Wei Meng-yen's devices.

00:21:18.833 --> 00:21:21.416
You can't just walk into a patient's room!

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:22.541
I'll get going.

00:21:22.625 --> 00:21:25.000
-Already?
-Yes, I'll be back tomorrow.

00:21:30.291 --> 00:21:33.541
-Is this his phone?
-You can't just take his stuff.

00:21:37.791 --> 00:21:39.750
Are you his attending physician?

00:21:40.333 --> 00:21:41.541
I'm his ER physician.

00:21:41.625 --> 00:21:43.583
Okay, please register here.

00:21:44.125 --> 00:21:45.291
I need to register now?

00:21:45.375 --> 00:21:48.125
Only the attending physician
and family can visit him.

00:21:48.208 --> 00:21:49.291
I can ask his family.

00:21:49.375 --> 00:21:51.625
-Don't worry. I'll get to work. Thanks.
-Okay.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.208
You can go now.

00:21:59.291 --> 00:22:01.625
A-Hua, didn't Mr. Jen tell us
to wait for him?

00:22:01.708 --> 00:22:03.416
Give him his stuff.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.333
-A-Hua.
-Stay out of it.

00:22:07.666 --> 00:22:09.916
You can leave
or you can wait for your lawyer.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.291
Let's go.

00:22:47.916 --> 00:22:49.375
What the heck?

00:22:59.583 --> 00:23:00.416
That's not good.

00:23:01.791 --> 00:23:02.625
What do we do?

00:23:02.708 --> 00:23:04.041
What now?

00:23:09.041 --> 00:23:10.041
Let's go.

00:23:54.666 --> 00:23:56.500
UPLOAD VIDEO

00:23:57.708 --> 00:23:58.750
UPLOADING FILE

00:24:03.958 --> 00:24:05.666
This is all on you!

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:07.750
Your video is on the internet.

00:24:11.375 --> 00:24:12.333
Shit.

00:24:14.333 --> 00:24:18.291
Why is this video different
from the one on the internet?

00:24:25.166 --> 00:24:27.166
This is the file found on your computer.

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:29.708
The video you used
to threaten Wei Meng-yen.

00:24:31.125 --> 00:24:33.750
This is the version that leaked online.

00:24:33.833 --> 00:24:35.625
Who gave you the video?

00:24:36.958 --> 00:24:38.250
Kuo Ta-fu.

00:24:38.333 --> 00:24:40.458
You've already killed two people.

00:24:40.541 --> 00:24:42.958
You're facing two life sentences.

00:24:43.041 --> 00:24:43.916
Please cooperate.

00:24:46.916 --> 00:24:48.083
You gave it to me

00:24:49.125 --> 00:24:50.166
just now.

00:24:52.583 --> 00:24:54.541
So you didn't upload this video?

00:24:55.458 --> 00:24:57.625
You're a fucking cop. Figure it out.

00:25:04.791 --> 00:25:07.166
I'm not the only one who wants them dead.

00:26:06.291 --> 00:26:08.250
Hey, A-Li. You're just in time.

00:26:08.333 --> 00:26:09.291
I just got…

00:26:10.333 --> 00:26:11.250
Mr. Ho.

00:26:11.916 --> 00:26:13.541
-Don't make this hard.
-What?

00:26:14.791 --> 00:26:15.833
A-Hua, what?

00:26:17.041 --> 00:26:18.125
Cooperate with us.

00:26:19.958 --> 00:26:21.000
Why are you filming?

00:26:21.541 --> 00:26:22.541
I'm a cop. Stop it!

00:26:22.625 --> 00:26:23.541
Chen-wei!

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:29.000
Li Hsin-ping, you're pointing a gun at me?

00:26:30.416 --> 00:26:32.125
Do you know what you're doing?

00:26:34.208 --> 00:26:37.041
The deceased's name was Chao Kuo-an.

00:26:37.125 --> 00:26:38.166
He was also…

00:26:38.833 --> 00:26:40.166
Ho Chen-wei's informant.

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:41.750
Mr. Ho?

00:26:46.458 --> 00:26:47.791
Didn't expect this, right?

00:26:52.333 --> 00:26:53.750
You really tried to kill me?

00:26:53.833 --> 00:26:56.916
Good thing I tampered with the device.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
Or you would've really killed Wei Yen.

00:27:05.291 --> 00:27:06.541
Everyone, look!

00:27:06.625 --> 00:27:08.916
The real killer is right here.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:13.875
Did you see that?

00:27:13.958 --> 00:27:15.166
-Terrifying.
-I'm scared.

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:16.916
He really wanted to kill Wei Yen.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.708
-Witch Baba's live stream!
-Insane!

00:27:26.333 --> 00:27:27.666
-First Precinct…
-Ho Chen-wei.

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:29.500
Ting-yu, Wei Yen, cool.

00:27:31.291 --> 00:27:32.708
New memes incoming!

00:27:32.791 --> 00:27:34.291
Got you!

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:37.625
WHO WILL SAVE WEI YEN?

00:27:37.708 --> 00:27:39.500
KILLER!

00:27:39.583 --> 00:27:41.916
I waited all night for this big scene.

00:27:42.416 --> 00:27:44.458
-Anyone called the cops?
-He is a cop.

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:48.000
KILLER!

00:27:48.083 --> 00:27:49.375
EGG WATER RIVER STUDIO

00:27:49.458 --> 00:27:50.708
Got you!

00:27:50.791 --> 00:27:51.833
It's him?

00:27:56.791 --> 00:27:58.041
That's scary.

00:27:58.125 --> 00:27:59.708
A killer caught red-handed.

00:27:59.791 --> 00:28:02.750
Not only a cop, but a squad leader.

00:28:02.833 --> 00:28:04.291
LIVE

00:28:04.375 --> 00:28:05.416
Look at you.

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:06.875
You're surrounded.

00:28:06.958 --> 00:28:09.166
-Ting-yu, step back.
-Where you gonna go?

00:28:09.833 --> 00:28:12.541
You piece of shit.
You had the nerve to yell at me.

00:28:13.708 --> 00:28:14.958
Where are you gonna go now?

00:28:17.208 --> 00:28:18.208
Put down the gun!

00:28:19.375 --> 00:28:21.250
Hey, wait…

00:28:22.416 --> 00:28:23.500
TRYING TO RECONNECT

00:28:26.125 --> 00:28:27.208
Why'd it cut out?

00:28:27.291 --> 00:28:28.333
How did this happen?

00:28:28.416 --> 00:28:29.500
Is it his connection?

00:28:29.583 --> 00:28:30.958
It must be.

00:28:31.541 --> 00:28:32.583
Ting-yu.

00:28:33.375 --> 00:28:34.833
Can anyone else stream?

00:28:36.375 --> 00:28:37.666
Why are you filming?

00:28:38.333 --> 00:28:39.833
THIS NURSE IS AT THE SCENE

00:28:41.375 --> 00:28:43.000
-There it is.
-There it is.

00:28:45.041 --> 00:28:46.333
Bump it up.

00:28:47.375 --> 00:28:48.583
IT DISCONNECTED

00:28:49.375 --> 00:28:50.458
Why are you filming?

00:28:50.541 --> 00:28:51.541
Chen-wei.

00:28:52.083 --> 00:28:53.125
Mr. Ho.

00:28:54.916 --> 00:28:56.625
Get back! Drop your guns!

00:28:56.708 --> 00:28:58.208
Hey… Ting-yu!

00:28:58.291 --> 00:28:59.291
How did he get him?

00:29:00.166 --> 00:29:01.000
It's horrifying.

00:29:01.083 --> 00:29:02.583
You guys

00:29:02.666 --> 00:29:04.666
are trying to frame me.

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:06.250
I'm Ho Chen-wei, squad leader.

00:29:06.333 --> 00:29:07.250
Drop your guns!

00:29:07.833 --> 00:29:08.708
Chen-wei.

00:29:09.541 --> 00:29:11.000
Stop it.

00:29:11.083 --> 00:29:12.541
You're an influencer now.

00:29:14.958 --> 00:29:16.041
Fine.

00:29:16.125 --> 00:29:17.458
Let's cut the act.

00:29:17.958 --> 00:29:19.041
Drop your guns!

00:29:19.708 --> 00:29:21.583
Get back! Drop your guns!

00:29:21.666 --> 00:29:22.500
Put them down!

00:29:22.583 --> 00:29:23.791
Put them down!

00:29:24.333 --> 00:29:26.166
Fucking drop them! Don't you get it?

00:29:27.666 --> 00:29:28.666
Drop them!

00:29:34.791 --> 00:29:36.500
Put them on the floor!

00:29:41.166 --> 00:29:42.000
Step back!

00:29:46.833 --> 00:29:47.833
Step back!

00:29:48.625 --> 00:29:49.541
Get the fuck back!

00:29:49.625 --> 00:29:50.958
Don't move unless I say!

00:29:57.541 --> 00:29:58.958
PRAYING THE COPS CAN HANDLE IT

00:29:59.041 --> 00:30:00.375
YOU TRUST THE COPS?

00:30:00.458 --> 00:30:01.291
GO, TING-YU!

00:30:01.375 --> 00:30:02.291
Get back!

00:30:02.958 --> 00:30:04.458
-Chen-wei.
-Go away!

00:30:04.541 --> 00:30:06.333
-Get lost!
-Calm down.

00:30:06.833 --> 00:30:07.916
Okay?

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.791
Shoot! Do you dare shoot me?

00:30:09.875 --> 00:30:11.083
Press the elevator!

00:30:14.666 --> 00:30:16.458
You don't dare shoot me.

00:30:17.333 --> 00:30:18.666
-Hey…
-Shoot!

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:20.625
-Don't push it!
-I'm a fucking cop.

00:30:24.083 --> 00:30:25.250
Don't.

00:30:25.833 --> 00:30:26.666
Shoot!

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:28.416
-Ting-yu.
-Yes?

00:30:29.208 --> 00:30:30.041
You're ugly.

00:30:30.625 --> 00:30:32.166
What are you talking about?

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:34.625
Ugly? You're ugly. This is so cute.

00:30:36.791 --> 00:30:39.166
You have to shake your shoulders
on the second "Yo".

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:40.083
Yo!

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:47.375
-What are you doing?
-No way.

00:30:51.166 --> 00:30:52.416
Yo…

00:31:05.458 --> 00:31:06.875
BABA ISN'T THERE?

00:31:06.958 --> 00:31:08.625
WEI YEN IS AT THE SCENE!

00:31:08.708 --> 00:31:11.000
MORE NERVOUS THAN WHEN MY WIFE GAVE BIRTH

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:43.125
Fuck. You almost scared me to death.

00:31:54.583 --> 00:31:55.416
Are you okay?

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:56.333
I'm fine.

00:32:03.458 --> 00:32:04.833
TING-YU IS SAFE

00:32:04.916 --> 00:32:06.666
Thanks, guys. We're fine now.

00:32:07.416 --> 00:32:09.208
Officer Chen Chia-jen saved me.

00:32:11.541 --> 00:32:12.583
That's my dad!

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:14.833
That almost scared me to death.

00:32:14.916 --> 00:32:16.416
I'm exhausted.

00:32:27.583 --> 00:32:29.666
-My goodness.
-That's great.

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:32.166
-Looking forward to the next video.
-Missing Wa Tsai.

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:34.708
-Rest in peace, Wa Tsai and Kao Pi.
-Wei Yen's amazing.

00:32:36.125 --> 00:32:38.041
Ting-yu and Wei Yen, get some rest.

00:32:38.125 --> 00:32:38.958
Good night.

00:32:46.291 --> 00:32:49.416
Welcome to What's Up Yo! Yo!

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:50.833
We're at this place today.

00:32:50.916 --> 00:32:52.375
It looks like someone's home.

00:32:52.458 --> 00:32:54.875
You'll never guess who the guest is today.

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.041
Let me make a prediction.

00:32:57.125 --> 00:32:58.958
Today's guest is a big shot.

00:32:59.041 --> 00:33:00.416
Please welcome

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.166
Witch Baba!

00:33:03.291 --> 00:33:04.583
Hello, everyone.

00:33:04.666 --> 00:33:05.958
I'm Witch Baba.

00:33:06.541 --> 00:33:09.333
This is the long-awaited
influencer room reveal.

00:33:09.416 --> 00:33:13.541
Today, we're gonna show you the room
where Witch Baba makes her predictions.

00:33:13.625 --> 00:33:15.208
Can you not wear that mask?

00:33:15.291 --> 00:33:17.083
-It looks terrifying.
-I'm sorry.

00:33:17.166 --> 00:33:18.708
I'm shy without the mask.

00:33:18.791 --> 00:33:21.708
Why are you shy?
You're a million-follower influencer.

00:33:21.791 --> 00:33:24.125
How about giving us another prediction

00:33:24.208 --> 00:33:25.875
before we start the tour?

00:33:25.958 --> 00:33:27.333
Predict this.

00:33:28.375 --> 00:33:30.583
How do you think my injury is recovering?

00:33:30.666 --> 00:33:32.041
Okay, as always,

00:33:32.125 --> 00:33:35.958
we'll have Ting-yu from What's Up Yo! Yo!
draw a card for us.

00:33:36.041 --> 00:33:38.250
-This one.
-London Big Ben reversed.

00:33:38.333 --> 00:33:40.958
It signifies that time is paused.

00:33:41.041 --> 00:33:42.791
That means your recovery time

00:33:42.875 --> 00:33:45.000
is almost over, right?

00:33:45.958 --> 00:33:47.958
It doesn't hurt!

00:33:48.041 --> 00:33:50.500
-No pain…
-Are you serious or are you bluffing?

00:33:51.708 --> 00:33:53.458
Ladies and gentlemen.

00:33:53.541 --> 00:33:55.333
Wait, where's your injury?

00:33:55.416 --> 00:33:56.708
Let me show you

00:33:56.791 --> 00:33:58.625
Ting-yu's amazing recovery power.

00:33:58.708 --> 00:33:59.916
That's impossible.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.708
-Do you know why?
-Why?

00:34:01.791 --> 00:34:03.125
The injury's on this hand.

00:34:03.208 --> 00:34:05.125
I'm speechless. That's so lame.

00:34:05.208 --> 00:34:06.750
All right, no more jokes.

00:34:06.833 --> 00:34:08.625
We actually have a few things

00:34:08.708 --> 00:34:09.916
to share with you today.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.916
As you know, we've experienced

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.083
some pretty terrifying incidents lately.

00:34:14.166 --> 00:34:15.375
That's right.

00:34:15.458 --> 00:34:16.583
And…

00:34:18.208 --> 00:34:20.791
We can both agree
that we've personally witnessed

00:34:21.458 --> 00:34:24.041
how easy it is
to lose control of the internet.

00:34:25.583 --> 00:34:29.708
We want to apologize to everyone again.

00:34:29.791 --> 00:34:32.625
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

00:34:33.625 --> 00:34:35.666
As for my next steps,

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:37.833
I will keep cooperating with the police.

00:34:37.916 --> 00:34:41.125
I hope everyone is doing well.

00:34:42.458 --> 00:34:45.250
That's the heavy stuff over with.

00:34:45.916 --> 00:34:47.166
Let's talk about…

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:48.416
something cheerful.

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.958
My best friend, Chen Yu-chieh,

00:34:51.041 --> 00:34:54.333
will be having her solo concert soon.

00:34:54.416 --> 00:34:58.250
That's right. In 2022,
the night of December 7th,

00:34:58.333 --> 00:34:59.625
9:30 p.m.

00:34:59.708 --> 00:35:00.791
See you there.

00:35:00.875 --> 00:35:02.333
Make sure you go.

00:35:05.916 --> 00:35:06.916
Chia-jen!

00:35:14.208 --> 00:35:17.416
Why are you still frowning?
How can you go there like this?

00:35:21.083 --> 00:35:22.125
Kuo Ta-fu

00:35:22.208 --> 00:35:23.625
took potassium cyanide.

00:35:23.708 --> 00:35:25.458
The bracelet was his late wife's.

00:35:25.541 --> 00:35:27.958
So the hospital let him keep it on.

00:35:28.708 --> 00:35:30.666
He never intended to live.

00:35:32.208 --> 00:35:33.041
Also…

00:35:34.333 --> 00:35:36.125
Lin Ting-yu's verdict is out.

00:35:37.708 --> 00:35:39.541
For vehicle endangerment and damage,

00:35:39.625 --> 00:35:42.250
the judge sentenced him and Wei Meng-yen

00:35:42.333 --> 00:35:43.541
to 60 days of detention.

00:35:45.708 --> 00:35:47.208
Wei Meng-yen, he…

00:35:47.291 --> 00:35:48.791
He's been discharged.

00:35:49.541 --> 00:35:50.916
They're not pressing charges.

00:35:51.625 --> 00:35:53.083
You'll be back at work soon.

00:35:58.416 --> 00:35:59.500
So…

00:36:00.625 --> 00:36:03.583
-You want to ask about Ho Chen-wei, right?
-No way.

00:36:03.666 --> 00:36:05.375
That shot you fired

00:36:05.458 --> 00:36:08.166
went through his right collarbone.

00:36:09.083 --> 00:36:10.583
His life isn't in danger.

00:36:10.666 --> 00:36:12.291
You were lucky.

00:36:12.375 --> 00:36:14.708
No, I calculated it, and I aimed for it.

00:36:14.791 --> 00:36:16.583
You aimed for it? Yeah, right!

00:36:16.666 --> 00:36:18.125
If you'd actually killed him,

00:36:18.208 --> 00:36:19.708
you'd be in way more trouble.

00:36:20.875 --> 00:36:22.291
Okay, enough said. Let's go.

00:36:22.375 --> 00:36:24.000
Go ahead. I need a cigarette.

00:36:24.833 --> 00:36:26.041
Do you want one?

00:36:26.125 --> 00:36:27.833
Forget it, you quit.

00:36:27.916 --> 00:36:29.791
Hurry… Just go. Go ahead.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.541
Don't smoke too much.
It's not good for you.

00:36:35.833 --> 00:36:36.666
You care about me?

00:36:37.791 --> 00:36:40.208
Are you on the internet every day now?

00:36:40.291 --> 00:36:42.583
My daughter's on there.

00:36:48.708 --> 00:36:51.333
Will you talk to me?

00:36:52.166 --> 00:36:55.583
Even if you don't answer

00:36:55.666 --> 00:36:57.916
Just wondering

00:36:59.291 --> 00:37:04.000
Did you get the flowers sent to you?

00:37:04.083 --> 00:37:07.833
Will you talk to me?

00:37:07.916 --> 00:37:12.583
Is everything all right today?

00:37:12.666 --> 00:37:16.416
I'm thinking of you again

00:37:18.666 --> 00:37:21.750
Every detail of you

00:37:21.833 --> 00:37:28.750
I miss it twelve million times

00:37:28.833 --> 00:37:32.583
I'm afraid that if I skip one,
you'll become a bit blurry

00:37:32.666 --> 00:37:35.666
Every season without you

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:42.166
I miss you twelve million times

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:44.791
When it comes to goodbye

00:37:44.875 --> 00:37:49.125
Who's willing to say goodbye?

00:37:49.208 --> 00:37:51.875
Little by little

00:37:52.458 --> 00:37:55.833
I'm still learning

00:37:55.916 --> 00:37:59.250
to live in a world without you

00:38:00.041 --> 00:38:03.000
Will you talk to me?

00:38:03.541 --> 00:38:06.791
Ask me, "What time are you coming home?"

00:38:06.875 --> 00:38:09.291
"Have you eaten?"

00:38:10.708 --> 00:38:15.041
I remember your nagging look

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:19.166
Will you talk to me?

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:23.875
It's fine if we do our own thing

00:38:23.958 --> 00:38:27.791
Just think it over again

00:38:30.208 --> 00:38:32.666
Every season without you

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:39.250
I miss you twelve million times

00:38:39.958 --> 00:38:42.416
When it comes to goodbye

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:47.208
Who's willing to say goodbye?

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:54.000
Yu-chieh!

00:38:56.083 --> 00:38:57.541
Yu-chieh!

00:38:59.583 --> 00:39:01.041
The next song

00:39:01.625 --> 00:39:03.333
is for my dad.

00:43:01.958 --> 00:43:06.958
