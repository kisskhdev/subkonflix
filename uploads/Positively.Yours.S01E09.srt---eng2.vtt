Are you pregnant?

What are you doing right now?

00:01:04.872 --> 00:01:07.938
President, what brings you here?

00:01:09.338 --> 00:01:11.038
Manager Jang.

00:01:11.038 --> 00:01:13.172
- Huh?
- What do you mean there's a problem

00:01:13.172 --> 00:01:15.472
with the quality of the ale beer test?

00:01:16.138 --> 00:01:17.172
A problem with the quality?

00:01:17.172 --> 00:01:19.589
The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety
contacted the person in charge.

00:01:19.589 --> 00:01:20.938
Didn't you hear?

00:01:20.938 --> 00:01:22.605
I wasn't informed...

00:01:22.605 --> 00:01:24.705
Hey, Manager Jang!

00:01:31.205 --> 00:01:33.838
Everyone out, except Manager Jang.

00:01:37.738 --> 00:01:40.105
Didn't you hear what I just said?

Are you not leaving?

00:01:41.438 --> 00:01:43.705
Let's move. Please step outside.

How on earth are you handling your work?

00:02:04.738 --> 00:02:07.838
Does it make sense that the person
in charge found out later than me?

00:02:22.005 --> 00:02:26.205
By this time, you should have identified
the problem and prepared countermeasures.

00:02:26.205 --> 00:02:29.705
I'm sorry. I'll go check immediately.

00:02:29.705 --> 00:02:32.805
Do you think I came all this way
just to hear you apologize?

00:02:32.805 --> 00:02:36.472

take responsibility, Manager Jang?

What should we do?

00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:45.305
Is it okay to leave
Manager Jang alone like that?

00:02:45.305 --> 00:02:46.935
- Yeah, I've never seen the President
- Fix it!

It looks like she's taking
all the blame alone.

Right.

00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:53.905
She took full responsibility
to protect our team.

- What am I supposed to do?
- If you made a mistake, you must apologize.

Well...

just going to sit and watch?

Are you sure you're okay?

00:03:29.005 --> 00:03:31.672
Wasn't the President being a bit too harsh?

00:03:31.672 --> 00:03:33.861
I thought the glass was going to shatter.

00:03:33.861 --> 00:03:35.172
Oh.

00:03:35.172 --> 00:03:36.505
So that's why he came by?

00:03:36.505 --> 00:03:39.738
Yeah, if it weren't for the President,
I would've been totally exposed.

00:03:39.738 --> 00:03:42.205
He kind of saved me.

00:03:42.205 --> 00:03:43.772

or comments there?

people might figure out who it is.

I mean she could have done it for the money.

00:09:49.272 --> 00:09:53.238
Right, maybe she deliberately seduced him,
then exposed him when it didn't go her way.

00:09:53.238 --> 00:09:55.077
That's what I'm saying.

00:09:55.077 --> 00:09:57.038
- Oh.
- Morning.

00:09:57.038 --> 00:09:59.305
What do you think, Manager Jang?

00:09:59.305 --> 00:10:01.405
- Pardon?
- You work in a key department.

00:10:01.405 --> 00:10:02.705
Thought you might've heard something.

00:10:02.705 --> 00:10:05.605
Well, I'm not sure.

00:10:12.805 --> 00:10:14.605
Did I see wrong that day?

00:10:14.605 --> 00:10:17.405
- Didn't seem like a forced relationship.
- Listen.

00:10:17.405 --> 00:10:20.872
Either way, the situation itself is...

00:10:24.105 --> 00:10:25.838
Noona.

00:10:25.838 --> 00:10:27.305
This is the office.

00:10:27.305 --> 00:10:29.905
It's weird. Really weird.

00:10:29.905 --> 00:10:33.305
The location is just too strange, you know.

00:10:34.738 --> 00:10:38.638
Is that article about the President true?

00:10:40.172 --> 00:10:43.372
No, how could it be?

00:10:43.372 --> 00:10:47.269
That he's seeing someone? And she's pregnant?

00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:50.138
Well, that's...

00:10:51.638 --> 00:10:53.505
Ugh, jeez.

00:10:53.505 --> 00:10:54.772
Why is it so dusty in here?

00:10:54.772 --> 00:10:56.205
My throat feels irritated.

00:10:56.205 --> 00:11:00.638
I'm really busy right now,
I'm sorry. I have to go.

00:11:10.872 --> 00:11:13.338
So why did she call us here now?

00:11:13.338 --> 00:11:15.238
I don't know.

00:11:15.238 --> 00:11:17.138
Okay, coffee's here.

00:11:17.138 --> 00:11:22.338
I got iced Americanos for everyone,
so don't drink it if you don't want to.

00:11:22.338 --> 00:11:23.872
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:11:23.872 --> 00:11:24.905
Is this on you, Team Leader?

00:11:24.905 --> 00:11:28.272
Manager Jang, coffee.

00:11:28.272 --> 00:11:32.605
Pardon? I already had coffee
this morning, so I'm fine.

00:11:32.605 --> 00:11:33.872
Whether you drank it or not,

00:11:33.872 --> 00:11:38.505
weren't you used to chugging
grande-sized drinks after lunch?

00:11:38.505 --> 00:11:41.972
Well, then, thank you.

00:11:44.272 --> 00:11:45.305
Be honest with me.

00:11:45.305 --> 00:11:47.938
What's the real reason you can't drink?

00:11:47.938 --> 00:11:50.672
There's one reason
that comes to mind right now.

00:11:50.672 --> 00:11:53.305
I'm asking because I hope
that's not the real reason.

00:11:53.305 --> 00:11:56.938
So give me a plausible reason. What is it?

00:12:00.325 --> 00:12:02.438
- Is there something?
- If you can't convince me now,

00:12:02.438 --> 00:12:05.672
all the projects you're in charge of,
I'll hand them over to Manager Nah.

00:12:05.672 --> 00:12:06.705
Team Leader.

00:12:06.705 --> 00:12:09.905
So either give me a reason I can accept,

00:12:09.905 --> 00:12:11.405
or

00:12:11.405 --> 00:12:13.872
step away from all your projects.

00:12:24.605 --> 00:12:26.949
What's wrong with Team Leader?

00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:28.453
Jeez.

00:12:33.317 --> 00:12:34.937
- Here.
- Okay.

00:12:36.372 --> 00:12:39.838
But has anyone actually
seen Manager Jang drink recently?

00:12:39.838 --> 00:12:43.272
Exactly. She hasn't even posted drinking
proof shots in the group chat lately.

00:12:43.272 --> 00:12:47.138
Come to think of it, last time
we visited a brewery for a contest.

00:12:47.138 --> 00:12:49.072
I don't think she drank beer then either.

00:12:49.072 --> 00:12:50.505
- Don't tell me...
- Don't tell you what?

00:12:50.505 --> 00:12:52.572
Are you saying Manager Jang is pregnant?

00:12:52.572 --> 00:12:54.805
Pregnant? Then the person in that rumor is...

00:12:54.805 --> 00:12:57.105
Oh my. That's it, that's it.

00:12:57.105 --> 00:13:00.172
Come on, that's too much.
Does that make sense?

00:13:00.172 --> 00:13:03.372
She only cares about work.
When would she have time with the President?

00:13:03.372 --> 00:13:06.538
You've been watching too many dramas.

00:13:10.841 --> 00:13:12.389
Sorry.

00:13:18.972 --> 00:13:20.505
Thank goodness it didn't get exposed.

00:13:20.505 --> 00:13:22.805
Does Team Leader know something?

00:13:22.805 --> 00:13:25.505
Exactly. We can't ask outright.

00:13:25.505 --> 00:13:28.472
Should I tell the truth?

00:13:28.472 --> 00:13:31.272
Even if you do tell her,
now doesn't feel like the right time.

00:13:31.272 --> 00:13:33.338
The company is too chaotic right now.

00:13:33.338 --> 00:13:36.838
Okay. I'll be more careful.

00:13:36.838 --> 00:13:38.138
By the way,

00:13:38.138 --> 00:13:40.453
have you contacted the President?

00:13:40.453 --> 00:13:42.172
Oh.

00:13:42.172 --> 00:13:44.905
He's probably swamped right now.

00:13:45.972 --> 00:13:48.005
I feel terrible since this seems
to have happened because of me.

00:13:48.005 --> 00:13:49.605
How could it be because of you?

00:13:49.605 --> 00:13:51.838
Please don't think that way.

00:13:52.738 --> 00:13:55.938
He's stronger than you think.

00:13:55.938 --> 00:13:58.105
He definitely won't crumble
over something like this.

00:13:58.105 --> 00:14:00.672
Just trust us and wait a little longer.

00:14:00.672 --> 00:14:02.085
Okay,

00:14:02.085 --> 00:14:03.269
thanks.

00:14:26.105 --> 00:14:30.105
Yes, that level of coverage will be fine.

00:14:30.105 --> 00:14:32.138
Understood.

00:14:33.772 --> 00:14:35.205
I told you your phone stays off.

00:14:35.205 --> 00:14:36.305
Don't turn it on yet.

00:14:36.305 --> 00:14:38.638
But shouldn't I contact Hui Won?

00:14:38.638 --> 00:14:39.672
She'll keep worrying.

00:14:39.672 --> 00:14:41.338
Just for a moment.

00:14:41.338 --> 00:14:42.738
The company is currently

00:14:42.738 --> 00:14:44.901
handling the defamation case.

00:14:44.901 --> 00:14:46.272
Just until then, okay?

00:14:46.272 --> 00:14:49.138
Do you also wish
I'd followed Father's advice?

00:14:49.805 --> 00:14:52.638
I know it's not completely wrong,

00:14:53.538 --> 00:14:55.938
but I'm not sure it's right either.

00:14:57.972 --> 00:15:00.038
I know what's holding you back.

00:15:00.038 --> 00:15:03.105
But the Chairman didn't say that lightly.

00:15:03.105 --> 00:15:05.005
I'm worried about Hui Won too,

00:15:05.005 --> 00:15:07.405
but every word you say,

00:15:07.405 --> 00:15:09.505
every action you take represents the company.

00:15:11.405 --> 00:15:13.205
Think as rationally as possible.

00:15:13.205 --> 00:15:14.538
You're good at that.

00:15:14.538 --> 00:15:17.505
Judging without being swayed
by emotions or circumstances.

00:15:17.505 --> 00:15:19.372
Right now,

00:15:20.172 --> 00:15:22.305
that's what will protect you.

00:15:34.405 --> 00:15:35.538
Hello.

00:15:35.538 --> 00:15:38.138
Yeah, come in. Mi Ran already ordered.

00:15:38.138 --> 00:15:39.172
Sit here.

00:15:39.172 --> 00:15:40.905
Okay.

00:15:41.905 --> 00:15:43.305
Did you hear?

00:15:43.305 --> 00:15:47.172
That Taehan Liquor President, Kang Du Jun,
who had a blind date at our place.

00:15:47.172 --> 00:15:48.438
It's total chaos.

00:15:48.438 --> 00:15:50.305
They say he hit on
every woman at the company.

00:15:50.305 --> 00:15:53.305
He went after any woman
he could get his hands on.

00:15:53.305 --> 00:15:55.405
No wonder he looked like a player.

00:15:55.405 --> 00:15:59.238
He even pressured that pregnant woman
into abortion and paid her off.

00:15:59.238 --> 00:16:00.638
What a psycho. Unbelievable.

00:16:00.638 --> 00:16:03.438
Who'd drink their beer? It's disgusting.

00:16:04.272 --> 00:16:06.438
Excuse me.

00:16:06.438 --> 00:16:07.438
Did you see it yourself?

00:16:07.438 --> 00:16:10.105
Did you actually see our president
going after every woman

00:16:10.105 --> 00:16:11.805
just because she's a woman?

00:16:11.805 --> 00:16:13.472
- What the...
- What's it to you?

00:16:13.472 --> 00:16:15.572
- Who are you?
- What do you mean?

00:16:15.572 --> 00:16:17.372
I'm actually that...

00:16:17.372 --> 00:16:19.238
She's that one!

00:16:19.238 --> 00:16:21.505
She's the crazy ex in this neighborhood.

00:16:21.505 --> 00:16:25.238
When she gets mad, she smashes bottles
and grabs collars. Total chaos.

00:16:25.238 --> 00:16:28.272
Don't bother. Just walk away.

00:16:29.638 --> 00:16:33.172
Hey, I told you causing trouble
again would be bad.

00:16:33.172 --> 00:16:34.905
Come on.

00:16:42.072 --> 00:16:43.972
Hotels get guests like that all the time.

00:16:43.972 --> 00:16:48.438
Just play dead and avoid them.
That's the smart move.

00:16:49.872 --> 00:16:52.138
Wow. I can't believe these words
came out of my mouth.

00:16:52.138 --> 00:16:54.138
You've grown up, Hwang Mi Ran.

00:16:54.138 --> 00:16:56.772
I know,

00:16:56.772 --> 00:16:58.538
but listening to that makes my blood boil.

00:16:58.538 --> 00:17:01.705
Oh, so you can't stand hearing
your boyfriend get insulted, huh?

00:17:01.705 --> 00:17:02.905
Hey, even so,

00:17:02.905 --> 00:17:05.605
what if it gets exposed
because you stepped in?

00:17:06.405 --> 00:17:08.138
Actually,

00:17:09.038 --> 00:17:12.005
I don't know if staying quiet
is really right.

00:17:12.005 --> 00:17:14.238
What if I say I'm the woman
in that tabloid article?

00:17:14.238 --> 00:17:16.872
And if I say the President
isn't that kind of person?

00:17:16.872 --> 00:17:19.038
Wouldn't that clear up at least
some of the misunderstanding?

00:17:19.038 --> 00:17:20.072
Well.

00:17:20.072 --> 00:17:21.838
Given the current situation,

00:17:21.838 --> 00:17:24.672
would anyone believe it?

00:17:24.672 --> 00:17:26.772
What people care about is Kang Du Jun.

00:17:26.772 --> 00:17:27.941
People find it entertaining to watch

00:17:27.941 --> 00:17:30.572
a rich heir who has everything
fall from grace.

00:17:30.572 --> 00:17:33.472
And if it's revealed that you're the woman,

00:17:33.472 --> 00:17:37.038
you'll get torn apart too,
are you okay with that?

00:17:40.605 --> 00:17:43.505
The President must be looking for
his own way to handle this.

00:17:43.505 --> 00:17:47.372
If you step forward unnecessarily,
it might make things worse, so for now,

00:17:47.372 --> 00:17:49.372
just focus on yourself and Yeol Mu.

00:17:49.372 --> 00:17:51.905
Eat something, even if you have to force it.

00:17:51.905 --> 00:17:54.538
You like rolled omelets, right? Try some.

00:18:14.105 --> 00:18:16.472
You know who's behind this, don't you?

00:18:16.472 --> 00:18:19.038
Your sister-in-law is waiting
for you to make a mistake.

00:18:19.038 --> 00:18:20.438
The moment you acknowledge that woman,

00:18:20.438 --> 00:18:22.638
it becomes the excuse to bring you down.

00:18:22.638 --> 00:18:24.238
For now, do as I say.

00:18:24.238 --> 00:18:27.438
Because that's the way
to protect you and her.

00:18:58.505 --> 00:19:00.205
Hui Won.

00:19:03.605 --> 00:19:05.138
President.

00:19:05.138 --> 00:19:09.072
I'm sorry, I couldn't contact you
because my phone was off.

00:19:10.672 --> 00:19:12.305
Still,

00:19:12.305 --> 00:19:16.538
was it really that hard to send
one text saying you're okay?

00:19:21.221 --> 00:19:23.605
You were waiting for my call, weren't you?

00:19:23.605 --> 00:19:25.605
I don't know.

00:19:28.772 --> 00:19:30.905
I missed you, really.

00:19:34.838 --> 00:19:36.538
Me too.

00:19:47.172 --> 00:19:48.905
Do you have somewhere to go?

00:19:48.905 --> 00:19:52.538
The news said reporters are
even camped out in front of your house.

00:19:52.538 --> 00:19:54.338
I need to head back to the office.

00:19:54.338 --> 00:19:56.997
- I'll probably be in meetings all night.
- Oh.

00:19:58.205 --> 00:19:59.605
Yeah?

00:19:59.605 --> 00:20:00.938
You look a little disappointed.

00:20:00.938 --> 00:20:03.605
What if I'm not just a little
but very disappointed?

00:20:04.472 --> 00:20:07.172
Shall I cancel all the meetings
and everything else?

00:20:07.172 --> 00:20:08.438
Don't be ridiculous.

00:20:08.438 --> 00:20:10.138
I'm saying this because I'm worried.

00:20:10.138 --> 00:20:11.405
I'm really okay.

00:20:11.405 --> 00:20:13.505
You don't need to worry about me.

00:20:14.972 --> 00:20:18.805
I feel like I shouldn't have recommended
you as the commercial model.

00:20:18.805 --> 00:20:23.538
Because of me, you became more exposed,
and now it's even harder for you.

00:20:23.538 --> 00:20:26.205
I'll just reveal everything myself.

00:20:26.205 --> 00:20:28.672
If I step forward
and say the rumors aren't true,

00:20:28.672 --> 00:20:29.905
- then you...
- No.

00:20:29.905 --> 00:20:31.838
I don't want that.

00:20:31.838 --> 00:20:33.305
The moment it's revealed,

00:20:33.305 --> 00:20:35.138
people will say all your achievements

00:20:35.138 --> 00:20:37.005
were gained because of me,
and they'll belittle you.

00:20:37.005 --> 00:20:39.405
And it might create
even bigger misunderstandings.

00:20:39.405 --> 00:20:41.638
I'm looking for a solution now.

00:20:41.638 --> 00:20:45.272
Trust me and wait a little longer, okay?

00:20:46.572 --> 00:20:48.272
Okay.

00:20:51.472 --> 00:20:54.638
The subscriber's phone is turned off.

00:20:54.638 --> 00:20:56.972
- Oh, jeez.
- Please leave a message...

00:20:56.972 --> 00:21:00.505
[Son]
Where is he, and why isn't he answering?

00:21:10.172 --> 00:21:11.405
You picked up right away.

00:21:11.405 --> 00:21:13.905
Were you expecting an important call?

00:21:13.905 --> 00:21:15.838
Expecting what?

00:21:15.838 --> 00:21:17.272
Why are you calling
this early in the morning?

00:21:17.272 --> 00:21:19.472
Would you like to grab some coffee?

00:21:24.838 --> 00:21:26.905
Is Du Jun doing alright?

00:21:26.905 --> 00:21:29.905
I saw the news and got worried.

00:21:29.905 --> 00:21:32.405
Du Jun would never do such things.

00:21:32.405 --> 00:21:34.405
It's probably all fake news anyway.

00:21:34.405 --> 00:21:37.072
Still, at the company, they're
treating it as a major incident.

00:21:37.072 --> 00:21:41.205
I mean, some of it does sound kind of true.

00:21:41.205 --> 00:21:42.938
Yeah?

00:21:42.938 --> 00:21:46.372
He hasn't told me anything about work lately.

00:21:46.372 --> 00:21:48.172
I didn't think much of it at first.

00:21:48.172 --> 00:21:50.505
But then I started to suspect

00:21:50.505 --> 00:21:52.438
the woman by his side.

00:21:54.205 --> 00:21:56.005
What woman?

00:21:56.005 --> 00:21:59.238
You didn't know he's seeing someone?

00:22:00.105 --> 00:22:01.538
Hold on.

00:22:01.538 --> 00:22:04.997
Are you saying there really is a woman?

00:22:04.997 --> 00:22:06.038
Oh.

00:22:06.038 --> 00:22:11.372
Come to think of it, I think he mentioned it
once at a blind date.

00:22:11.372 --> 00:22:14.149
Why? Do you know something?

00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:15.972
Oh.

00:22:15.972 --> 00:22:19.138
I'm not sure how to put this.

00:22:19.138 --> 00:22:24.572
At first when I learned she is
Se Hyeon's boss, it gave me a bad feeling.

00:22:24.572 --> 00:22:26.738
Turns out she's very ambitious.

00:22:26.738 --> 00:22:30.038
And seems to crave
climbing the social ladder.

00:22:30.038 --> 00:22:32.038
That much was understandable.

00:22:32.038 --> 00:22:33.805
But with Du Jun...

00:22:39.072 --> 00:22:41.638
Huh? What?

00:22:44.505 --> 00:22:50.138
Then that abortion story in the article...

00:22:51.038 --> 00:22:52.905
Oh my.

00:22:52.905 --> 00:22:54.638
Goodness.

00:22:55.772 --> 00:22:59.338
But surely he wouldn't do
something like that, right?

00:22:59.338 --> 00:23:01.872
Ugh, he's not even answering calls.

00:23:01.872 --> 00:23:04.938
Young people falling
for each other is one thing.

00:23:04.938 --> 00:23:07.272
But getting pregnant
right away? That's suspicious.

00:23:07.272 --> 00:23:11.105
To be blunt, are we even sure it's his child?

00:23:26.205 --> 00:23:28.872
These are all the solutions
we've come up with so far.

00:23:28.872 --> 00:23:30.638
Aren't they all essentially the same thing?

00:23:30.638 --> 00:23:32.105
We should release a rebuttal article
denying everything as groundless.

00:23:32.105 --> 00:23:34.438
At this point, that's
the most reliable solution.

00:23:34.438 --> 00:23:36.505
You're not thinking of
something else, are you?

00:23:36.505 --> 00:23:38.238
Like partially admitting to it?

00:23:38.238 --> 00:23:41.138
That won't work. Right now,
pretending we know nothing is

00:23:41.138 --> 00:23:42.305
more effective than telling the truth.

00:23:42.305 --> 00:23:43.338
You saw the stock price, didn't you?

00:23:43.338 --> 00:23:45.138
It dropped by eight percent in a single day.

00:23:45.138 --> 00:23:46.638
If you admit anything now,

00:23:46.638 --> 00:23:49.105
the company will completely collapse.

00:23:56.372 --> 00:23:58.105
President.

00:24:03.438 --> 00:24:05.138
Oh, Madam!

00:24:05.138 --> 00:24:06.338
What brings you here without even calling?

00:24:06.338 --> 00:24:11.338
I was just passing by
and thought I'd stop in.

00:24:11.338 --> 00:24:14.838
Is Du Jun very busy right now?

00:24:14.838 --> 00:24:17.238
The President is in a meeting.

00:24:17.238 --> 00:24:19.105
I'll tell him to wrap it up quickly and come.

00:24:19.105 --> 00:24:20.372
No, no.

00:24:20.372 --> 00:24:21.905
Why interrupt him during a meeting?

00:24:21.905 --> 00:24:23.672
I can wait a little.

00:24:23.672 --> 00:24:27.372
Then please have a seat.
I'll bring some tea right away.

00:24:28.405 --> 00:24:34.305
We have coffee, green tea, oolong tea,
brown rice tea, chamomile...

00:24:34.305 --> 00:24:35.738
Tea's fine.

00:24:35.738 --> 00:24:38.905
Just sit here for a moment.

00:24:38.905 --> 00:24:41.238
- Me?
- Yes.

00:24:41.238 --> 00:24:45.138
I want to ask you something.

00:24:46.772 --> 00:24:48.472
Okay.

00:24:49.172 --> 00:24:50.738
Well...

00:24:50.738 --> 00:24:54.805
I heard Du Jun is seeing a woman these days.

00:24:54.805 --> 00:24:57.405
Ah, that's...

00:24:57.405 --> 00:24:59.738
I'm just curious.

00:24:59.738 --> 00:25:02.533
You know who she is, right, Secretary Go?

00:25:02.533 --> 00:25:06.038
I heard she's Se Hyeon's
team leader or something.

00:25:06.038 --> 00:25:07.705
Is that true?

00:25:07.705 --> 00:25:09.672
Ah, well...

00:25:14.672 --> 00:25:16.838
Yes.

00:25:16.838 --> 00:25:21.638
I know Du Jun hates this kind of thing,

00:25:21.638 --> 00:25:25.829
but I'm just so curious, that's all.

00:25:25.829 --> 00:25:27.272
Well,

00:25:27.272 --> 00:25:29.572
with rumors

00:25:29.572 --> 00:25:33.572
of an abortion coming out, too...

00:25:36.372 --> 00:25:39.972
But you know better than anyone that
he isn't that kind of person.

00:25:39.972 --> 00:25:41.105
Right?

00:25:41.105 --> 00:25:42.705
Our Du Jun isn't that kind of boy, right?

00:25:42.705 --> 00:25:46.172
Besides, he's quite particular, isn't he?

00:25:46.172 --> 00:25:47.538
Yes, exactly.

00:25:47.538 --> 00:25:49.772
Whether he's working or at home,

00:25:49.772 --> 00:25:52.072
he's not very easygoing.

00:25:52.072 --> 00:25:54.072
He's not someone who dates lightly

00:25:54.072 --> 00:25:56.438
or breaks things off casually,
so please understand that much.

00:25:56.438 --> 00:26:00.293
The rumors circulating now
will be cleared up soon.

00:26:00.293 --> 00:26:03.772
If that's the case, that's a relief.

00:26:03.772 --> 00:26:07.072
You've known Du Jun a long time, so you know,

00:26:07.072 --> 00:26:10.438
but he won't even get married
because of his brother.

00:26:10.438 --> 00:26:13.472
So hearing that he suddenly has a girlfriend,

00:26:13.472 --> 00:26:16.272
or that there's a child involved,

00:26:16.272 --> 00:26:18.072
I...

00:26:18.072 --> 00:26:19.505
I...

00:26:19.505 --> 00:26:21.938
I was just...

00:26:23.038 --> 00:26:26.905
It was all so sudden and shocking.

00:26:28.338 --> 00:26:31.438
Of course, I completely understand.

00:26:33.638 --> 00:26:35.172
Please don't worry too much.

00:26:35.172 --> 00:26:38.072
The President has always lived honorably,

00:26:38.072 --> 00:26:39.905
and especially to take his brother's place,

00:26:39.905 --> 00:26:42.772
he's always given his best to every task.

00:26:42.772 --> 00:26:43.972
That's true.

00:26:43.972 --> 00:26:47.238
Whether as a child or now,

00:26:47.238 --> 00:26:50.005
when it came to Han Jun's work,

00:26:50.005 --> 00:26:52.738
he always stepped up to help.

00:26:52.738 --> 00:26:54.725
Du Jun

00:26:54.725 --> 00:26:58.405
adored his brother so much.

00:26:59.372 --> 00:27:02.338
I'm sure he still misses him terribly.

00:27:02.972 --> 00:27:07.072
Because of that guilt toward his brother,

00:27:07.072 --> 00:27:09.338
he never really lived a life of his own.

00:27:09.338 --> 00:27:14.772
So hearing rumors like this,
it just feels so unsettling.

00:27:14.772 --> 00:27:18.372
I miss him too.

00:27:18.372 --> 00:27:20.672
Just as much as Du Jun does.

00:27:21.872 --> 00:27:23.572
I also...

00:27:24.872 --> 00:27:27.538
I miss him too.

00:27:45.638 --> 00:27:46.772
I'm sorry.

00:27:46.772 --> 00:27:49.472
I'm being so emotional today.

00:27:57.338 --> 00:27:59.333
[Product introduction]
That's why I want to launch

00:27:59.333 --> 00:28:00.805
this high-proof beer this time.

00:28:00.805 --> 00:28:03.338
Among people who enjoy drinking,
it will definitely create a buzz.

00:28:03.338 --> 00:28:06.005
But I actually think
it might lack mass appeal.

00:28:06.005 --> 00:28:07.141
There's whiskey and baijiu

00:28:07.141 --> 00:28:09.138
- for high-proof drinks.
- Yeah.

00:28:09.138 --> 00:28:11.105
And people could just drink soju instead.

00:28:11.105 --> 00:28:13.705
Would people really want high-proof drinks
when they're drinking beer?

00:28:13.705 --> 00:28:14.972
Young lady.

00:28:14.972 --> 00:28:17.405
That's not how you
should be approaching this.

00:28:17.405 --> 00:28:20.338
What do you think, Manager Jang?

00:28:20.338 --> 00:28:21.938
Manager Jang?

00:28:21.938 --> 00:28:23.138
- Pardon?
- What?

00:28:23.138 --> 00:28:24.172
You've been acting strange lately.

00:28:24.172 --> 00:28:26.338
You've been zoning out at the office nonstop.

00:28:27.005 --> 00:28:31.272
I'm sorry. I'm not feeling well today.

00:28:31.272 --> 00:28:33.605
Well, there's nothing more to discuss anyway.

00:28:33.605 --> 00:28:34.638
Shall we end it here?

00:28:34.638 --> 00:28:37.138
Okay, let's talk again next time.

00:28:43.472 --> 00:28:44.772
Give it to me.

00:28:44.772 --> 00:28:46.938
I'm fine.

00:28:46.938 --> 00:28:49.738
I'll carry this for you
up to the office entrance.

00:28:49.738 --> 00:28:51.572
But are you really okay?

00:28:51.572 --> 00:28:53.541
You're not sick or anything?

00:28:53.541 --> 00:28:55.077
Oh, well.

00:28:55.077 --> 00:28:57.338
I think I'm just hungry.

00:28:57.338 --> 00:28:59.405
My blood sugar's crashing.

00:29:02.838 --> 00:29:04.572
Want to grab dinner together?

00:29:04.572 --> 00:29:08.372
There's a place that might
help you right now.

00:29:11.272 --> 00:29:15.138
We'll have one ricotta cheese salad,

00:29:15.138 --> 00:29:17.272
one mozzarella pomodoro,

00:29:17.272 --> 00:29:18.572
one aglio e olio as well,

00:29:18.572 --> 00:29:20.672
truffle fries,

00:29:20.672 --> 00:29:22.738
and two glasses of this, please.

00:29:22.738 --> 00:29:24.933
- Yes.
- Thank you.

00:29:25.784 --> 00:29:27.461
Oh.

00:29:32.338 --> 00:29:33.605
Jang Hui Won?

00:29:33.605 --> 00:29:35.438
Huh?

00:29:35.438 --> 00:29:36.705
Don't you remember this place?

00:29:36.705 --> 00:29:38.372
- Huh?
- After I joined the company,

00:29:38.372 --> 00:29:40.072
when I was first picked
as an outstanding employee,

00:29:40.072 --> 00:29:43.105
you brought me here to celebrate.

00:29:44.038 --> 00:29:46.572
Oh, right.

00:29:46.572 --> 00:29:48.472
I did.

00:29:49.105 --> 00:29:52.305
Then do you remember us
having non-alcoholic wine?

00:29:52.305 --> 00:29:54.705
Because I drove that day,

00:29:54.705 --> 00:29:56.338
we had no choice but to order
non-alcoholic drinks.

00:29:56.338 --> 00:29:58.272
You tasted it and then

00:29:58.272 --> 00:30:01.805
said the flavor and aroma were incredible,
and even gave it a standing ovation.

00:30:01.805 --> 00:30:03.838
A standing ovation? Me?

00:30:03.838 --> 00:30:08.138
Well, that's what it felt like.

00:30:08.138 --> 00:30:10.238
You're really...

00:30:11.105 --> 00:30:12.505
I ordered a glass each for us again today.

00:30:12.505 --> 00:30:15.305
Thought you could try it again

00:30:15.305 --> 00:30:18.405
and use it as a reference
for your non-alcoholic beer.

00:30:19.438 --> 00:30:23.172
Hey, where else would you
find a friend like this?

00:30:40.038 --> 00:30:43.838
You're not someone who gets full this easily.

00:30:45.472 --> 00:30:48.438
I guess my digestion isn't great today.

00:30:49.272 --> 00:30:51.905
Why? Because of the President?

00:30:52.938 --> 00:30:57.072
You kept looking at your phone
ever since the meeting earlier.

00:30:57.072 --> 00:31:02.105
He's probably frantically
busy looking for alternatives,

00:31:02.105 --> 00:31:05.538
but I feel like I'm no help at all.

00:31:05.538 --> 00:31:07.525
Should you

00:31:07.525 --> 00:31:10.072
really stay by his side like this?

00:31:10.772 --> 00:31:15.138
It's exhausting even now, and there's
no guarantee this won't happen again.

00:31:17.538 --> 00:31:20.405
If it were me, I wouldn't
have let this happen.

00:31:20.405 --> 00:31:24.238
I would've answered every call,
never made you wait.

00:31:24.238 --> 00:31:27.138
No matter what, I would've
stayed by your side.

00:31:27.138 --> 00:31:29.472
I know. I get it too.

00:31:29.472 --> 00:31:31.672
He has a lot of responsibilities
to deal with.

00:31:31.672 --> 00:31:34.538
But still,

00:31:34.538 --> 00:31:36.805
I hate seeing you struggle.

00:31:42.205 --> 00:31:43.872
This is my choice too.

00:31:43.872 --> 00:31:46.205
I knew it wouldn't be easy when I started,

00:31:46.205 --> 00:31:49.238
so rather than regretting that choice,

00:31:49.238 --> 00:31:53.405
I want to do my best in whatever I can do.

00:31:53.405 --> 00:31:55.438
Thanks for worrying about me.

00:31:55.438 --> 00:31:57.172
I'll get through this.

00:31:57.172 --> 00:31:59.872
You know I'm strong in a crisis.

00:32:13.605 --> 00:32:15.638
Should you really stay by his side like this?

00:32:15.638 --> 00:32:16.872
It's exhausting even now,

00:32:16.872 --> 00:32:18.872
and there's no guarantee
this won't happen again.

00:32:18.872 --> 00:32:21.038
I hate seeing you struggle.

00:32:35.333 --> 00:32:36.405
Well.

00:32:36.405 --> 00:32:40.405
I'm sorry. If I'd known you were coming,
I would've at least bought some fruit.

00:32:40.405 --> 00:32:42.805
You must really love beer.

00:32:42.805 --> 00:32:45.029
Your whole house shows it.

00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:49.038
Oh, when I get fixated on something,
I tend to obsess over it.

00:32:49.038 --> 00:32:52.421
Now I finally understand why you cried over
not being able to drink at the restaurant.

00:32:52.421 --> 00:32:53.872
Oh.

00:32:53.872 --> 00:32:56.672
Please forget about that.

00:32:58.305 --> 00:33:00.405
You're so pure, Hui Won.

00:33:00.405 --> 00:33:02.905
That's why I like you so much.

00:33:02.905 --> 00:33:06.238
So I came in person for this final warning.

00:33:06.238 --> 00:33:10.238
- Pardon?
- I'm the one who leaked the article.

00:33:10.238 --> 00:33:14.405
My goal is to bring down Du Jun.

00:33:14.405 --> 00:33:17.072
But that is just between him and me.

00:33:17.072 --> 00:33:20.672
Before anyone else gets hurt,
break up with him.

00:33:20.672 --> 00:33:22.605
That's why I came to say this.

00:33:39.005 --> 00:33:41.672
I bear you no ill will.

00:33:41.672 --> 00:33:44.238
That's why I'm telling you kindly.

00:33:44.238 --> 00:33:46.105
Run away.

00:33:46.738 --> 00:33:48.172
If you don't,

00:33:48.172 --> 00:33:50.305
I'll have no choice but to play my next card.

00:33:50.305 --> 00:33:54.405
And then he might not be able to recover.

00:33:54.405 --> 00:33:56.972
Think carefully

00:33:56.972 --> 00:34:00.005
about what truly protects him.

00:34:00.005 --> 00:34:03.105
Why are you going this far? You're family.

00:34:03.105 --> 00:34:05.172
Well,

00:34:05.172 --> 00:34:07.838
I doubt you'd understand even if I told you.

00:34:07.838 --> 00:34:09.938
No, I don't understand.

00:34:09.938 --> 00:34:11.872
And I don't understand
why you're telling me all this.

00:34:11.872 --> 00:34:13.372
Because you're pure, Hui Won.

00:34:13.372 --> 00:34:16.972
Kind, harmless,

00:34:19.472 --> 00:34:21.905
and pitiful to look at,
so I don't want to hurt you either.

00:34:21.905 --> 00:34:24.238
So don't waste your energy.

00:34:24.238 --> 00:34:27.272
There's nothing you'll be able to do

00:34:27.272 --> 00:34:29.205
from now on.

00:34:49.705 --> 00:34:52.138
Here's your bill.

00:34:52.138 --> 00:34:53.905
Thank you.

00:35:12.038 --> 00:35:14.738
You left your wallet, but why
haven't you contacted me?

00:35:14.738 --> 00:35:17.405
Let's meet tomorrow.
I'll give it back to you.

00:35:19.305 --> 00:35:21.405
I explained it clearly, so don't worry.

00:35:21.405 --> 00:35:24.572
Couldn't we just expose that woman first?

00:35:24.572 --> 00:35:27.338
If Du Jun releases a denial article first...

00:35:27.338 --> 00:35:29.072
Struggling won't change anything.

00:35:29.072 --> 00:35:33.072
Something much more interesting
will happen tomorrow, so look forward to it.

What? Did you take a day off because of me?

00:36:03.938 --> 00:36:06.938
I've got a field trip this afternoon,
so I have a bit of time this morning.

00:36:06.938 --> 00:36:08.872
Then you have to head back soon.

00:36:08.872 --> 00:36:11.738
Didn't you call me to give me my wallet?

00:36:11.738 --> 00:36:14.172
Okay, well, if I push hard,
I should be able to make it.

00:36:14.172 --> 00:36:15.938
Huh? Make what?

00:36:15.938 --> 00:36:18.238

Ah, I'm full.

The protesters are everywhere.

00:37:18.138 --> 00:37:19.438
I just went to buy a coffee

00:37:19.438 --> 00:37:20.645
and they'd already blocked the entrance.

00:37:20.645 --> 00:37:21.705
I almost couldn't get in.

reporters is increasing.

to our company's image?

My junior was raving about wanting
to join our company not long ago.

00:37:30.905 --> 00:37:32.905
But she's gone completely quiet about it now.

00:37:32.905 --> 00:37:36.305
She said our company is too chaotic
and she's thinking of going to a competitor.

00:37:36.305 --> 00:37:39.938
No wonder, Office Talk is full of posts
criticizing the company and the President.

00:37:39.938 --> 00:37:41.672
It might not even be true.

00:37:41.672 --> 00:37:44.872
Because they're still just rumors.

If there were no basis, would there be
this many news articles and protesters?

00:37:54.872 --> 00:37:56.838
There must be something
for it to be like this.

00:37:56.838 --> 00:38:00.938
But in fact, nothing's been
clearly proven yet, right?

00:38:01.605 --> 00:38:02.838
I'm going to stay neutral for now.

00:38:02.838 --> 00:38:05.738
Our president doesn't
seem like the type to do that.

00:38:05.738 --> 00:38:07.705
What? Why are you suddenly
neutral by yourself?

00:38:07.705 --> 00:38:09.772
Then I'll wait and see for now.

00:40:08.538 --> 00:40:10.238
That awkward sense of responsibility,

00:40:10.238 --> 00:40:11.772
that's exactly him.

00:40:11.772 --> 00:40:12.972
Wow.

00:40:12.972 --> 00:40:17.405
His foolishness in protecting something small
while losing something bigger

00:40:17.405 --> 00:40:19.372
always holds him back.

00:40:19.372 --> 00:40:22.605
Good thing we're on the same side.

00:40:22.605 --> 00:40:28.772
When it comes to money and power,
family means nothing, it's brutal.

00:40:28.772 --> 00:40:31.038
You're the one who's truly wise.

00:40:31.038 --> 00:40:32.069
Just wait and see.

00:40:32.069 --> 00:40:33.905
I'll shake him down mentally so much

00:40:33.905 --> 00:40:36.672
he'll come down on his own.

00:40:38.005 --> 00:40:43.405
By the way, my brother
isn't the kind to stay still.

00:40:43.405 --> 00:40:45.701
Especially when

00:40:45.701 --> 00:40:47.338
it involves his son.

00:40:47.338 --> 00:40:48.705
Then it'll be easy.

00:40:48.705 --> 00:40:51.572
Because his weaknesses are extremely obvious.

00:40:59.705 --> 00:41:00.972
Why are you in such a hurry?

00:41:00.972 --> 00:41:02.072
You're even against an autopsy.

00:41:02.072 --> 00:41:03.572
Without a proper investigation,

00:41:03.572 --> 00:41:05.705
why are you rushing to cover everything up?

00:41:05.705 --> 00:41:08.305
Han Jun is your son too.

00:41:08.938 --> 00:41:10.205
The living need to live.

00:41:10.205 --> 00:41:11.905
Father!

00:41:12.605 --> 00:41:14.172
I know what you're thinking.

00:41:14.172 --> 00:41:16.205
But Du Jun isn't that kind of person.

00:41:16.205 --> 00:41:18.438
That's just your perspective, Father.

00:41:19.072 --> 00:41:20.772
My world has collapsed.

00:41:20.772 --> 00:41:22.805
Everything I ever dreamed of,

00:41:22.805 --> 00:41:24.872
the future we were supposed to share,

00:41:24.872 --> 00:41:27.905
and even Se Hyeon's father.

00:41:27.905 --> 00:41:30.838
Our entire family has fallen apart.

00:41:51.172 --> 00:41:54.938
A CEO who uses women as tools must step down!

00:41:54.938 --> 00:41:56.972
Step down! Step down!

00:41:56.972 --> 00:42:00.872
A CEO who tramples the weak
with power, must apologize.

00:42:00.872 --> 00:42:02.705
Apologize! Apologize!

00:42:02.705 --> 00:42:04.472
When did the protesters gather?

00:42:04.472 --> 00:42:06.538
Kang Du Jun, resign from Taehan Liquor!

00:42:06.538 --> 00:42:08.872
- Wait, I'll check.
- Resign! Resign!

00:42:08.872 --> 00:42:11.805
Dismiss Kang Du Jun for deceiving consumers!

00:42:11.805 --> 00:42:13.472
Dismiss him! Dismiss him!

00:42:13.472 --> 00:42:14.538
It's Kang Du Jun.

00:42:14.538 --> 00:42:16.838
The abusive President Kang Du Jun...

00:42:16.838 --> 00:42:18.372
- Mr. Kang Du Jun!
- Hey!

00:42:18.372 --> 00:42:20.572
- Mr. Kang Du Jun!
- Si Hyeong, get in quickly.

00:42:20.572 --> 00:42:25.005
- Mr. Kang Du Jun!
- Mr. Kang Du Jun!

00:42:25.005 --> 00:42:27.109
Mr. Kang Du Jun!

00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:29.093
Mr. Kang Du Jun!

00:42:29.093 --> 00:42:31.608
Please say something!

00:42:58.072 --> 00:43:02.105
Why do they have to chase us this far?

00:43:02.105 --> 00:43:03.805
Calm down a bit.

00:43:09.669 --> 00:43:11.237
Watch out!

00:43:41.572 --> 00:43:42.572
Get in.

00:43:42.572 --> 00:43:44.872
Huh? Hui Won?

00:43:50.472 --> 00:43:51.505
Si Hyeong, please handle them.

00:43:51.505 --> 00:43:52.805
Okay, Hui Won, go!

00:43:52.805 --> 00:43:54.505
- Yes.
- Hurry.

00:44:09.472 --> 00:44:11.005
But how did you know to come here?

00:44:11.005 --> 00:44:13.638
Protesters were everywhere on my way to work.

00:44:13.638 --> 00:44:16.238
I figured something big must be happening.

00:44:16.238 --> 00:44:17.972
What about work?

00:44:17.972 --> 00:44:20.438
Is work important right now?

00:44:21.572 --> 00:44:24.772
So you know how to drive all along?

00:44:24.772 --> 00:44:28.972
I just don't have a car,
but it's not that I can't drive.

00:44:49.772 --> 00:44:52.905
Wow, this feels refreshing.

00:44:53.838 --> 00:44:56.805
Aren't you overdoing it for my sake?

00:44:57.438 --> 00:44:59.838
It's good.

00:44:59.838 --> 00:45:04.238
Lately, nothing seems to go my way,

00:45:04.238 --> 00:45:08.938
and I've been frustrated
that I can't do anything.

00:45:08.938 --> 00:45:13.205
Now I feel as if a huge weight
has been lifted.

00:45:16.338 --> 00:45:18.272
Don't apologize.

00:45:18.272 --> 00:45:20.838
Because it wasn't your fault.

00:45:22.438 --> 00:45:24.172
Thank you.

00:45:28.672 --> 00:45:30.205
Aren't you hungry?

00:45:30.205 --> 00:45:32.772
I skipped work for the first time
in my life today.

00:45:32.772 --> 00:45:34.338
- Let's go have some fun.
- Huh?

00:45:34.338 --> 00:45:36.838
Quickly, quickly. Let's go quickly.

00:45:38.705 --> 00:45:40.405
How is it?

00:45:41.105 --> 00:45:42.872
It's fascinating.

00:45:43.772 --> 00:45:45.138
Is this your first time at a market?

00:45:45.138 --> 00:45:47.538
- Yes.
- How rustic.

00:45:47.538 --> 00:45:48.705
Is it really that rustic?

00:45:48.705 --> 00:45:50.205
Of course.

00:45:50.205 --> 00:45:51.572
Look over there.

00:45:51.572 --> 00:45:53.272
Over there.

00:45:55.938 --> 00:45:56.938
How do I look?

00:45:56.938 --> 00:45:58.205
- It suits you well.
- Yeah?

00:45:58.205 --> 00:46:00.072
Then you should try this on, President.

00:46:00.072 --> 00:46:01.772
Me?

00:46:05.038 --> 00:46:06.072
How do I look?

00:46:06.072 --> 00:46:07.805
It looks great.

00:46:22.405 --> 00:46:23.838
Pupa!

00:46:23.838 --> 00:46:24.838
I'm fine.

00:46:24.838 --> 00:46:26.672
It actually tastes amazing,
despite how it looks.

00:46:26.672 --> 00:46:28.005
It looks terrifying.

00:46:28.005 --> 00:46:29.538
Just try it once.

00:46:29.538 --> 00:46:30.672
- No.
- Just once.

00:46:30.672 --> 00:46:32.005
- Please.
- Just once.

00:46:32.005 --> 00:46:34.661
- Open it.
- I really can't eat this.

00:46:37.238 --> 00:46:38.238
How is it?

00:46:38.238 --> 00:46:40.105
I'm telling you, it's good!

00:46:40.105 --> 00:46:41.972
See? I was right.

00:46:41.972 --> 00:46:43.672
It's the perfect time for it.

00:46:43.672 --> 00:46:45.005
You two look so good together.

00:46:45.005 --> 00:46:47.372
Enjoy yourselves while you're young.

00:46:52.938 --> 00:46:54.053
[Sailfin sandfish and sand eels]

00:46:58.572 --> 00:47:01.005
Wow, the fruit looks delicious.

00:47:01.005 --> 00:47:02.838
Do you want some fruit?

00:47:03.838 --> 00:47:05.905
It's hard to choose.

00:47:15.621 --> 00:47:16.705
Are you newlyweds?

00:47:16.705 --> 00:47:18.472
Pardon?

00:47:18.472 --> 00:47:20.905
You just look so fresh and lovely together.

00:47:20.905 --> 00:47:23.205
Among all the people
who came to our market this year,

00:47:23.205 --> 00:47:26.405
you two are the prettiest
and the most handsome.

00:47:26.405 --> 00:47:27.438
Thank you.

00:47:27.438 --> 00:47:30.205
Jeez, I wonder when I'll ever get married.

00:47:30.205 --> 00:47:32.138
The only thing that makes eye contact with me

00:47:32.138 --> 00:47:36.138
is the flounder at that fish stall.

00:47:36.138 --> 00:47:39.972
Here, try this. It's tasty.

00:47:39.972 --> 00:47:42.072
Thank you.

00:47:42.072 --> 00:47:44.272
It reminds me of you two,

00:47:44.272 --> 00:47:46.172
so fresh and lively.

00:47:47.138 --> 00:47:49.305
- Come again.
- Yes.

00:47:50.572 --> 00:47:52.305
Let's go.

00:48:39.905 --> 00:48:41.605
Thank you.

00:48:45.772 --> 00:48:46.838
What?

00:48:46.838 --> 00:48:49.005
It's a shame.

00:48:49.705 --> 00:48:54.238
I felt like, 'My free time
is slipping away like this.'

00:48:56.472 --> 00:49:02.305
I never even got to enjoy things like this.
What was all that running for?

00:49:02.305 --> 00:49:05.505
The first time is the hardest,
but it'll get easier after the second time.

00:49:05.505 --> 00:49:07.705
Let's skip work together
more often from now on.

00:49:07.705 --> 00:49:08.805
Jeez.

00:49:08.805 --> 00:49:13.138
Is it appropriate for the President
to tell employees to skip work?

00:49:23.472 --> 00:49:24.738
Well,

00:49:24.738 --> 00:49:30.338
remember the story you
told me about your brother?

00:49:31.605 --> 00:49:33.372
Yes.

00:49:33.372 --> 00:49:35.238
How is your relationship
with your sister-in-law?

00:49:35.238 --> 00:49:37.338
Why are you asking that all of a sudden?

00:49:37.338 --> 00:49:38.738
Just wondering.

00:49:38.738 --> 00:49:40.905
When the three of us met last time,

00:49:40.905 --> 00:49:43.738
it seemed like there was
some tension between you two.

00:49:46.272 --> 00:49:48.105
It can't be good.

00:49:48.105 --> 00:49:50.272
Not after something like that.

00:49:51.138 --> 00:49:52.838
I see.

00:50:00.572 --> 00:50:03.338
President, there's something
I need to tell you.

00:50:05.572 --> 00:50:07.338
What if we just pretend

00:50:08.272 --> 00:50:10.972
we don't know each other?

00:50:11.738 --> 00:50:13.338
What?

00:50:13.338 --> 00:50:16.638
I don't have the confidence
to handle this kind of life,

00:50:16.638 --> 00:50:18.938
and I don't want Yeol Mu

00:50:18.938 --> 00:50:22.105
to get criticized when I'm exposed.

00:50:22.105 --> 00:50:24.338
So let's just hide everything.

00:50:24.338 --> 00:50:27.905
Deny it. Say it's groundless.

00:50:29.205 --> 00:50:30.505
What is it all of a sudden?

00:50:30.505 --> 00:50:33.672
Did you hear something somewhere?

00:50:33.672 --> 00:50:35.805
I'm scared.

00:50:35.805 --> 00:50:40.138
Last time, I tried to step up
and reveal everything,

00:50:40.138 --> 00:50:42.805
but I immediately regretted it.

00:50:43.605 --> 00:50:45.338
Just like you said,

00:50:45.338 --> 00:50:50.572
I don't like having all my effort dismissed
as some 'favor' from you.

00:50:50.572 --> 00:50:52.261
I just

00:50:52.261 --> 00:50:55.305
hate being the subject of gossip.

00:51:00.838 --> 00:51:03.005
So, let's just

00:51:06.338 --> 00:51:09.038
keep some distance.

00:51:09.038 --> 00:51:11.138
Are you serious?

00:51:26.338 --> 00:51:27.972
If you want me to explain instead, I will.

00:51:27.972 --> 00:51:29.705
If you want me to reveal
everything, I'll do it.

00:51:29.705 --> 00:51:33.538
I'll do anything to clear his name.

00:51:33.538 --> 00:51:38.705
So please, don't tell me
to break up with him.

00:51:38.705 --> 00:51:42.305
I know it's absurd
after causing all this trouble.

00:51:42.305 --> 00:51:43.672
That's why

00:51:43.672 --> 00:51:46.338
I've been thinking carefully

00:51:46.338 --> 00:51:48.505
and speaking with difficulty.

00:51:50.538 --> 00:51:55.672
Now I understand why Du Jun
is trying so hard to protect you.

00:51:55.672 --> 00:51:56.672
Pardon?

00:51:56.672 --> 00:51:57.972
You're going to do anything?

00:51:57.972 --> 00:52:00.905
Then, Hui Won, you have to help me.

00:52:00.905 --> 00:52:03.672
Du Jun might not listen to me,

00:52:03.672 --> 00:52:06.572
but he'll probably listen to you.

00:52:12.538 --> 00:52:16.405
Is that really what you want?

00:52:16.405 --> 00:52:18.438
Look me in the eye and tell me.

00:52:18.438 --> 00:52:21.905
Are you saying we should deny both you

00:52:21.905 --> 00:52:24.372
and our Yeol Mu in front of everyone?

00:52:24.372 --> 00:52:26.438
- Wouldn't that hurt your feelings?
- Why would it hurt my feelings?

00:52:26.438 --> 00:52:28.872
It's okay to tell a little lie sometimes.

00:52:28.872 --> 00:52:31.805
Hiding it doesn't mean it disappears.
Why does it matter?

00:52:31.805 --> 00:52:33.372
If anyone asks,

00:52:33.372 --> 00:52:35.472
I can hide you, President,
as many times as needed.

00:52:35.472 --> 00:52:36.972
I have to survive first,

00:52:36.972 --> 00:52:38.838
right?

00:52:43.505 --> 00:52:45.572
Hui Won.

00:52:45.572 --> 00:52:47.272
Jang Hui Won.

00:52:49.138 --> 00:52:51.172
Are you just going to leave like this?

00:52:55.505 --> 00:52:56.938
I called him.

00:52:56.938 --> 00:52:59.105
President, please take Secretary Go's car.

00:52:59.105 --> 00:53:01.405
Let's part ways here.

00:53:28.472 --> 00:53:29.538
What happened?

00:53:29.538 --> 00:53:31.172
Wasn't she coming to save you?

00:53:31.172 --> 00:53:34.972
She asked me to pretend not to know,
said it's okay to deny it.

00:53:34.972 --> 00:53:36.709
But for some reason,

00:53:36.709 --> 00:53:38.705
it didn't feel like she meant it.

00:53:38.705 --> 00:53:40.072
You know

00:53:40.072 --> 00:53:41.805
how careful Hui Won is.

00:53:41.805 --> 00:53:43.705
The fact that such a person said that means

00:53:43.705 --> 00:53:45.538
she must be

00:53:45.538 --> 00:53:48.172
worried about you that much.

00:53:51.672 --> 00:53:53.338
Du Jun.

00:53:53.338 --> 00:53:55.838
There must be a reason
everyone is saying that.

00:53:55.838 --> 00:53:58.105
It's just for now.

00:53:58.105 --> 00:54:04.072
Take care of the urgent matters first.
There's no rush to reveal the truth.

00:54:04.072 --> 00:54:05.872
I'll help you.

00:54:19.172 --> 00:54:21.138
Did I do the right thing?

00:54:23.738 --> 00:54:27.205
But this is the way to protect him.

00:54:29.605 --> 00:54:31.305
You did well.

00:54:32.138 --> 00:54:34.505
It was the best you could do.

Please leave a message after the beep...

Manager Jang took a day off today.

00:56:08.938 --> 00:56:11.605
- Day off?
- Haven't you contacted her?

00:56:14.805 --> 00:56:16.372
I know you're having a hard time, Uncle.

00:56:16.372 --> 00:56:18.705
But Manager Jang has been struggling too.

00:56:18.705 --> 00:56:22.072
Lately, people in the office
have all been suspecting her.

00:56:22.072 --> 00:56:25.572
You probably know best
how things should be done,

00:56:25.572 --> 00:56:27.605
but try to understand her feelings too.

00:56:27.605 --> 00:56:29.405
There's two of them now.

00:57:36.172 --> 00:57:38.338
Gather the reporters tomorrow.

00:57:38.338 --> 00:57:40.538
I'm going to hold a press conference.

00:57:50.505 --> 00:57:51.638
Big news! Big news!

They're holding
a press conference at 3 PM today.

00:57:53.805 --> 00:57:55.138
He's going to explain everything?

00:57:55.138 --> 00:57:57.272
So, is he going to say
who the woman in the rumor is?

00:57:57.272 --> 00:57:59.005
Yes.

00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:04.421
I'm dying to know.

00:58:08.505 --> 00:58:09.838
A press conference?

00:58:09.838 --> 00:58:11.272
Not just a rebuttal article?

00:58:11.272 --> 00:58:12.472
Don't worry too much.

00:58:12.472 --> 00:58:14.105
Nothing serious will happen.

00:58:14.105 --> 00:58:16.705
Okay, got it. Thanks.

[Press conference on Taehan Liquor CEO
Kang Du Jun's scandal]

00:58:31.805 --> 00:58:34.705
Unexpected. He's choosing a head-on approach.

00:58:34.705 --> 00:58:38.705
Since the explanation was delayed,
it seems he wants to apologize properly.

[Taehan Liquor President Kang Du Jun
issues urgent statement]

Sir, please hurry.

Please go quickly.

00:59:22.138 --> 00:59:23.305
Yes, understood.

00:59:23.305 --> 00:59:25.938
But let me make this clear.

00:59:25.938 --> 00:59:27.738
The report

00:59:30.605 --> 00:59:32.738
and its contents

00:59:33.805 --> 00:59:37.253
are completely false.

00:59:37.253 --> 00:59:40.672
- What?
- All false?

00:59:40.672 --> 00:59:45.205
At least, based on the articles
you wrote, that is the case.

00:59:45.205 --> 00:59:47.505
- What did he say?
- All fake?

00:59:47.505 --> 00:59:51.105
A coercive relationship,
urging an abortion, womanizing.

00:59:51.105 --> 00:59:56.172
I firmly state that none
of this ever happened.

00:59:56.172 --> 00:59:57.338
But

00:59:57.338 --> 00:59:59.972
it's true that

00:59:59.972 --> 01:00:03.672
I have someone I love,

01:00:05.538 --> 01:00:07.013
and that person is carrying my child.

01:00:07.013 --> 01:00:08.805
- So that's true.
- Pregnant with his baby?

01:00:08.805 --> 01:00:10.949
- You got that?
- The baby's real.

01:00:15.472 --> 01:00:16.805
Are you admitting to a relationship

01:00:16.805 --> 01:00:18.405
["The woman I truly love is pregnant"]
with a company employee now?

01:00:18.405 --> 01:00:21.105
Are you saying that it's true
that the employee is pregnant?

01:00:21.105 --> 01:00:22.138
Yes, that's correct.

01:00:22.138 --> 01:00:24.505
How can you prove that you weren't

01:00:24.505 --> 01:00:25.505
exploiting your position with her?

01:00:25.505 --> 01:00:28.272
Just hearing that, I can't tell at all

01:00:28.272 --> 01:00:31.872
whether you two are just
an ordinary couple or truly in love.

01:00:43.105 --> 01:00:46.672
At first, she was a bit strange.

01:00:46.672 --> 01:00:48.517
Here's grape juice...

01:00:48.517 --> 01:00:50.821
No!

01:00:52.069 --> 01:00:54.938
To the point where I never
wanted to see her again.

01:00:54.938 --> 01:00:56.805
She was peculiar and intimidating.

01:00:56.805 --> 01:00:58.772
- Did you get that?
- So she's real?

01:00:58.772 --> 01:01:01.093
- Does he know what he's saying?
- We'll see.

01:01:24.638 --> 01:01:26.372
But

01:01:27.072 --> 01:01:29.972
we ended up meeting again.

01:01:29.972 --> 01:01:32.338
And in an even more unexpected way.

01:01:40.438 --> 01:01:42.705
From that moment,

01:01:42.705 --> 01:01:45.705
I strangely became curious
about what she would do next.

01:01:46.605 --> 01:01:47.872
That's when I made up my mind.

01:01:47.872 --> 01:01:49.972
I've decided that I must
study in Germany next.

01:01:49.972 --> 01:01:53.572
I've decided to create my own beer
that will captivate foreigners' taste buds.

01:01:53.572 --> 01:01:54.738
That's my dream.

01:01:54.738 --> 01:01:58.705
Especially, I envied the way
her eyes sparkled

01:01:59.572 --> 01:02:01.305
when talking about beer.

01:02:01.305 --> 01:02:02.905
So that's why you fell for her?

01:02:02.905 --> 01:02:04.472
Is that all made up?

01:02:04.472 --> 01:02:07.705
Honestly, until then, it was just curiosity.

01:02:07.705 --> 01:02:10.738
Then when did you really start liking her?

01:02:16.938 --> 01:02:19.205
When she said

01:02:19.205 --> 01:02:20.905
she was giving up her dream.

01:02:20.905 --> 01:02:25.838
I gave up my lifelong dream
with my own hands.

01:02:25.838 --> 01:02:29.205
If I don't work now,
I feel like I'll actually die.

01:02:29.205 --> 01:02:30.872
Please stop telling me to rest.

01:02:30.872 --> 01:02:33.838
When the person who spoke of dreams

01:02:33.838 --> 01:02:35.872
with such sparkling eyes
said she would give up,

01:02:35.872 --> 01:02:38.205
I realized then.

01:02:39.105 --> 01:02:41.038
That seeing her dream disappear

01:02:41.038 --> 01:02:44.438
is sadder than my own dream being crushed.

01:02:45.072 --> 01:02:46.805
That I

She is really precious to me.

So I can't lie to deny her.

It's okay if you doubt me and criticize me.

01:03:53.138 --> 01:03:57.372
