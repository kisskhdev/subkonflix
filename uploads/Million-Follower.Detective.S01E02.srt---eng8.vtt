WEBVTT

00:00:10.208 --> 00:00:12.208
Guess what place I got today?

00:00:21.458 --> 00:00:22.875
You're home.

00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.083
Dinner's ready.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.833
Mom!

00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:02.958
WITCH BABA

00:01:03.041 --> 00:01:06.250
Hello, everyone. I'm Witch Baba.

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.500
Today is October 2nd.

00:01:08.583 --> 00:01:11.291
My last prediction about the shooting

00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:13.458
actually happened, right?

00:01:13.541 --> 00:01:18.041
The injured person is still
in critical condition at the hospital.

00:01:18.125 --> 00:01:21.541
Let's keep him
in our thoughts and prayers.

00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:22.666
So…

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.375
let's draw the next cards.

00:01:26.458 --> 00:01:28.166
I wonder what message

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.000
the cards have for us.

00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:32.708
First card.

00:01:33.291 --> 00:01:34.958
Second card.

00:01:35.458 --> 00:01:37.166
Third card.

00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:41.083
Hollywood upright.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.333
Pope reversed.

00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:47.958
The Pentagon reversed.

00:01:48.458 --> 00:01:49.708
In the future…

00:01:51.208 --> 00:01:54.541
someone will die from drowning.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.083
I'm sorry.

00:03:56.583 --> 00:03:59.375
OCTOBER 3RD

00:04:02.333 --> 00:04:06.666
YUNONG BRIDGE

00:04:18.541 --> 00:04:19.708
WEI

00:04:19.791 --> 00:04:21.916
-Hello, guys. I'm Wei Yen.
-Hi, I'm Wa Tsai.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.583
Welcome to our channel, Wei Fa Yen.

00:04:24.666 --> 00:04:25.500
Today,

00:04:25.583 --> 00:04:27.708
we're at the notorious breakup spot.

00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:29.916
-Where's that?
-Lover's Bridge!

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.083
They say couples who come here break up.

00:04:32.166 --> 00:04:33.166
-They break up?
-Yes.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.500
I gotta call my girl.

00:04:34.583 --> 00:04:36.416
-Damn, it's too late.
-Too late?

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.375
We're debunking this urban legend today.

00:04:38.458 --> 00:04:40.583
Tell me, what do couples like to do most?

00:04:40.666 --> 00:04:42.333
Couples like…

00:04:42.416 --> 00:04:44.041
-having sex.
-Love my ass.

00:04:44.125 --> 00:04:45.208
-What else?
-Shopping.

00:04:45.291 --> 00:04:46.958
So I brought this today. Here.

00:04:47.041 --> 00:04:49.250
Fuck, where'd you get it? Holy shit.

00:04:49.333 --> 00:04:51.458
Let's debunk this urban legend.

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:53.916
-Okay. No problem.
-Here we go.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.083
Three,

00:04:55.166 --> 00:04:56.541
two, one…

00:04:57.541 --> 00:04:59.000
Oh shit…

00:04:59.083 --> 00:05:00.250
What the fuck!

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:02.166
It's going fast. Will it flip over?

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.166
My butthole!

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.583
One million subscribers!

00:05:07.916 --> 00:05:08.958
Fuck, damn it!

00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:09.958
Are you okay?

00:05:10.041 --> 00:05:10.875
-Damn.
-You okay?

00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.041
-I'm fine.
-You good?

00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:13.875
What the fuck? I broke my tailbone.

00:05:15.333 --> 00:05:16.875
Let me see.

00:05:18.833 --> 00:05:19.666
Hey.

00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:22.041
Can you do it again?

00:05:22.125 --> 00:05:23.500
What do you mean? Why?

00:05:23.583 --> 00:05:24.416
What?

00:05:27.333 --> 00:05:29.208
I didn't catch it on video.

00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:31.791
What the fuck? I broke my ass for this!

00:05:31.875 --> 00:05:33.416
-I thought I did…
-Let's see.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.041
-But…
-Just check it.

00:05:35.125 --> 00:05:35.958
You didn't see it?

00:05:38.083 --> 00:05:39.916
I saw it, but I didn't get it on video.

00:05:40.916 --> 00:05:41.958
What am I, Jackie Chan?

00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:43.958
-How many times do I gotta crash?
-Relax.

00:05:44.041 --> 00:05:45.791
-He didn't mean to.
-Sorry.

00:05:46.291 --> 00:05:47.791
It's fine. I'll do it.

00:05:47.875 --> 00:05:49.166
Don't be mad.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.125
Shit.

00:05:53.125 --> 00:05:55.500
Hey, Wei Yen, it's fine. I'll do it.

00:05:55.583 --> 00:05:56.416
Let's go again.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.333
Wei Yen.

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:18.000
Hey, Ting-yu. What the fuck are you doing?

00:06:18.625 --> 00:06:19.666
What are you doing?

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.041
I'm doing it!

00:06:21.125 --> 00:06:22.375
Seriously? Hey!

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.166
-Damn!
-Shit…

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.291
Holy shit!

00:06:25.833 --> 00:06:27.416
-Damn.
-What the fuck?

00:06:29.208 --> 00:06:31.125
Hey…

00:06:31.208 --> 00:06:32.791
Fuck, hey.

00:06:32.875 --> 00:06:34.208
Are you crazy?

00:06:34.291 --> 00:06:35.291
Are you okay?

00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:38.041
Are you trying to kill yourself?

00:06:39.041 --> 00:06:41.500
Fuck, you're fucking badass.

00:06:42.083 --> 00:06:43.333
Shit, listen.

00:06:43.416 --> 00:06:45.541
You almost went down the bridge.

00:06:45.625 --> 00:06:46.541
You're badass.

00:06:46.625 --> 00:06:48.041
Shit, it hurts like hell.

00:06:48.791 --> 00:06:49.708
Hey, Lin Ting-yu.

00:06:50.833 --> 00:06:52.250
Why not film your own stuff?

00:06:53.416 --> 00:06:54.541
Film what?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Start a channel.

00:06:58.166 --> 00:06:59.916
Are you crazy? I just got told off.

00:07:00.833 --> 00:07:02.750
Just ignore Wei Yen.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:04.416
He likes to act crazy.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.916
-He has a bad temper.
-Fuck!

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.041
What did you get?

00:07:09.125 --> 00:07:11.458
-Booze.
-Nice.

00:07:12.708 --> 00:07:14.583
I just saw your video. You crashed?

00:07:14.666 --> 00:07:15.958
It was badass, right?

00:07:16.041 --> 00:07:17.583
-Was it good?
-Fuck.

00:07:17.666 --> 00:07:19.208
Start your own channel.

00:07:19.291 --> 00:07:21.625
-Dude, I just said that.
-For real?

00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:24.208
You're Ting-yu, right?

00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:26.583
Yo! Yo! Ting-yu!

00:07:27.791 --> 00:07:29.250
That sucks.

00:07:30.416 --> 00:07:32.666
No, it should be like "What's up, yo!"

00:07:33.791 --> 00:07:35.541
-More hip hop.
-Isn't that the same?

00:07:35.625 --> 00:07:37.291
-Not bad, right?
-It's not better.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.750
Shit, how's that different?

00:07:40.833 --> 00:07:41.916
I added gestures.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.208
-That works.
-Looks good.

00:07:43.291 --> 00:07:44.583
We have the intro.

00:07:45.333 --> 00:07:46.583
Wait, again. What was it?

00:07:48.583 --> 00:07:49.583
Hold on.

00:07:51.375 --> 00:07:53.708
-Which hand first?
-Right first, then left.

00:07:53.791 --> 00:07:55.083
Right, then left.

00:07:55.666 --> 00:07:57.291
Okay. One, two, three.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.250
-That's good
-Not bad.

00:08:00.333 --> 00:08:01.625
-That's good.
-Listen.

00:08:01.708 --> 00:08:03.916
-Just start it.
-Okay. It's decided.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.166
Just start it…

00:08:06.791 --> 00:08:07.875
Okay, everyone.

00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.375
Early this morning, a local found a body

00:08:10.458 --> 00:08:12.708
floating in Shuangxi Riverside Park.

00:08:12.791 --> 00:08:17.375
The family confirmed that the deceased
is the well-known influencer Wa Tsai.

00:08:17.458 --> 00:08:19.916
Police aren't ruling out homicide.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.208
Sources say Wa Tsai was due to film
with influencers Hippo and Braised Egg,

00:08:24.291 --> 00:08:25.875
but he never showed up.

00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:29.041
Police have obtained footage
from nearby surveillance cameras.

00:08:29.125 --> 00:08:31.250
The exact cause of death is still pending.

00:08:31.833 --> 00:08:33.708
That's the latest from us.

00:08:33.791 --> 00:08:35.750
Now, back to the studio.

00:08:47.541 --> 00:08:50.041
The witness is a 38-year-old woman.

00:08:50.125 --> 00:08:52.750
She was jogging in the park at 6 a.m.

00:08:52.833 --> 00:08:54.791
when she found the body.

00:08:54.875 --> 00:08:58.583
Our officers arrived on scene
within ten minutes of getting the call.

00:08:58.666 --> 00:09:00.416
Forensics should be there as well.

00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:02.791
And…

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.125
Wei Meng-yen's condition
seems to have worsened.

00:09:07.875 --> 00:09:08.958
I know.

00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.333
Okay, everyone.

00:09:19.416 --> 00:09:22.041
Early this morning, a local found a body

00:09:22.125 --> 00:09:23.958
floating in Shuangxi Riverside Park.

00:09:24.041 --> 00:09:28.000
CID AGENT
POLICE LINE DO NOT CROSS

00:09:28.083 --> 00:09:30.916
We can go after we check this area.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.750
The deceased has ID on him.

00:09:32.833 --> 00:09:34.875
Liu Yen-hua, age 23.

00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.083
Goes by Wa Tsai.

00:09:36.166 --> 00:09:37.375
He's also an influencer.

00:09:37.875 --> 00:09:39.750
Time of death is within ten hours.

00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.166
Any other items?

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:35.083
Yes.

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.166
We found this in his pocket.

00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.166
Also, check this for me.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:40.625
MISSED CALL: TING-YU

00:10:40.708 --> 00:10:43.750
Is his left earring missing,
or was he not wearing one?

00:10:43.833 --> 00:10:44.666
Okay.

00:10:46.791 --> 00:10:47.875
Are you leaving?

00:10:48.625 --> 00:10:50.625
The witness statement is on the way.

00:10:51.666 --> 00:10:52.541
I don't need it.

00:10:53.041 --> 00:10:54.041
You don't?

00:10:54.875 --> 00:10:57.791
Mr. Li said the time of death
is within ten hours.

00:10:58.458 --> 00:11:02.125
Last night at 9 o'clock,
Witch Baba predicted a death by drowning.

00:11:02.208 --> 00:11:05.333
I'm not saying the two are related,
or that she's involved,

00:11:05.416 --> 00:11:07.375
but the timing is so close--

00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:10.375
I'm just saying
this isn't the primary crime scene.

00:11:12.208 --> 00:11:13.625
Didn't you notice?

00:11:14.708 --> 00:11:17.000
It was cleaner
inside his mouth than outside,

00:11:17.083 --> 00:11:19.041
so he didn't drown in the river.

00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.458
His hands had been tied behind his back.

00:11:22.541 --> 00:11:24.416
He had bruises on his neck.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.916
So he could've been drowned anywhere.

00:11:30.125 --> 00:11:32.250
Mr. Jen, do you guys
solve cases this fast?

00:11:32.833 --> 00:11:35.083
How long should it take then?

00:11:38.625 --> 00:11:39.458
Mr. Jen.

00:11:43.666 --> 00:11:44.916
He probably just fell in.

00:11:47.583 --> 00:11:48.625
This morning…

00:11:54.708 --> 00:11:57.083
A number called 13 times in a row…

00:12:02.291 --> 00:12:03.166
Yeah…

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:04.750
Nobody saw it all morning.

00:12:04.833 --> 00:12:06.833
-How did someone fall in?
-Yeah.

00:12:06.916 --> 00:12:08.375
That's so strange.

00:12:32.583 --> 00:12:33.500
Excuse me.

00:12:43.083 --> 00:12:45.791
Hey, miss. Are you in a hurry?

00:12:45.875 --> 00:12:48.291
This is a police investigation.
I have some questions.

00:12:50.291 --> 00:12:51.458
Did I do something?

00:12:52.166 --> 00:12:54.250
Why were you running away?

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:56.166
Show me some ID.

00:12:57.208 --> 00:12:58.291
Can cops do this?

00:13:00.208 --> 00:13:01.458
You saw what happened.

00:13:01.541 --> 00:13:03.416
A crime just went down.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:04.833
Your ID.

00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.250
I only have…

00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:13.916
What are you doing here?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:14.958
Mr. Jen.

00:13:15.458 --> 00:13:16.416
Listen.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.083
The deceased's phone has 13 missed calls.

00:13:19.166 --> 00:13:20.750
Can you look into that?

00:13:21.291 --> 00:13:22.250
-Yes.
-Okay.

00:13:23.625 --> 00:13:24.625
You can go now.

00:13:27.166 --> 00:13:28.166
Hey…

00:13:29.291 --> 00:13:30.125
Hey.

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:33.333
Excuse me.

00:13:36.375 --> 00:13:39.666
Mr. Jen. You just let her go.
She's suspicious.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:40.708
Do you suspect her?

00:13:40.791 --> 00:13:42.375
-Yes.
-Do you have any evidence?

00:13:46.458 --> 00:13:47.416
I'm sorry.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.000
Hey. Don't apologize.

00:13:49.083 --> 00:13:51.875
You need intuition to work a case.

00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:54.541
If you suspect her,

00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:56.625
find the evidence first.

00:13:56.708 --> 00:13:57.625
Yes.

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:21.750
OCTOBER 3RD, 2022

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:33.708
I'm sorry.

00:16:33.791 --> 00:16:36.208
I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:37.125
I'm sorry.

00:16:40.416 --> 00:16:42.000
Don't do this.

00:16:50.041 --> 00:16:51.875
Why did you take my phone?

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.125
Are you Detective Conan?

00:17:02.208 --> 00:17:03.833
Where did you go last night?

00:17:05.375 --> 00:17:07.250
I was making deliveries.

00:17:08.041 --> 00:17:10.000
And after that?

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:14.250
That's none of your business.

00:17:24.208 --> 00:17:26.125
Where are you going?

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:27.833
Come here!

00:17:27.916 --> 00:17:29.708
I'm sorry!

00:17:34.583 --> 00:17:35.416
I'm sorry.

00:17:38.708 --> 00:17:41.125
Stop! Don't do this.

00:17:58.291 --> 00:17:59.583
I need all the vehicles

00:17:59.666 --> 00:18:01.458
parked nearby that day.

00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:06.541
Has anyone found out
where Liu Yen-hua was at five o'clock?

00:18:06.625 --> 00:18:08.583
Hold on. Yes, I'm on it.

00:18:08.666 --> 00:18:10.708
I got the surveillance camera footage.

00:18:10.791 --> 00:18:13.583
But there's a park ahead
with a lot of blind spots.

00:18:14.458 --> 00:18:15.375
Which park?

00:18:15.458 --> 00:18:16.416
Dunan Park.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.416
Lots of parking spots there.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.166
You should check his dashcam.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.750
I'll call you back.

00:18:22.833 --> 00:18:25.500
It's confirmed.
Liu Yen-hua is missing an earring.

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:28.000
It must've fallen off at the scene.

00:18:28.083 --> 00:18:30.375
-Didn't we search for it?
-Yes, we did.

00:18:30.458 --> 00:18:31.458
Thanks, officer.

00:18:31.541 --> 00:18:33.875
Let's pull the original one
and compare it.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.416
-Sure, okay.
-Mr. Jen.

00:18:36.916 --> 00:18:38.458
We got his call log.

00:18:38.541 --> 00:18:40.791
Lin Ting-yu made those 13 calls.

00:18:42.166 --> 00:18:43.916
-Lin Ting-yu?
-Yes.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:44.958
Their connection?

00:18:45.041 --> 00:18:46.250
-A-Jen
-Yes?

00:18:54.875 --> 00:18:55.708
Come in.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.291
What's that?

00:18:58.375 --> 00:18:59.583
The shooting report.

00:18:59.666 --> 00:19:00.500
I see.

00:19:01.541 --> 00:19:02.541
Perfect timing.

00:19:03.291 --> 00:19:04.333
SELF-REFLECTION REPORT

00:19:04.416 --> 00:19:05.458
Sit down.

00:19:10.583 --> 00:19:11.833
A-Jen

00:19:11.916 --> 00:19:13.500
I'm sorry about the other day.

00:19:13.583 --> 00:19:17.125
With High-Tech Crime here,
I had to put on a show.

00:19:17.208 --> 00:19:18.333
I understand.

00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:22.458
But why partner me with High-Tech Crime?

00:19:23.666 --> 00:19:24.500
A-Jen

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:27.000
At our age,

00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:29.291
we don't know much about the internet.

00:19:29.791 --> 00:19:32.083
I know Ho Chen-wei is annoying.

00:19:32.166 --> 00:19:35.208
Right after he became squad leader,
his informant died.

00:19:35.291 --> 00:19:36.666
-But--
-Hey.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:37.875
Not him.

00:19:37.958 --> 00:19:39.625
I'm talking about the woman.

00:19:39.708 --> 00:19:41.291
Okay. What's her name?

00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:43.875
I think her surname is Lin.

00:19:43.958 --> 00:19:46.541
-Lin…
-Li Hsin-ping.

00:19:46.625 --> 00:19:48.083
-Li Hsin-ping.
-Right.

00:19:48.166 --> 00:19:49.666
Yes, Li Hsin-ping.

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:53.625
She just transferred
to the High-Tech Crime Unit last month.

00:19:54.125 --> 00:19:56.208
She's our newest rookie.

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:59.250
Don't you want to know

00:19:59.833 --> 00:20:01.625
how young people think nowadays?

00:20:07.375 --> 00:20:08.916
FRIED RICE WAS GREAT, THANK YOU

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.375
I don't care. You're liars.

00:20:14.458 --> 00:20:16.916
Mom will see a doctor.
Dad, give me your cigarettes.

00:20:18.375 --> 00:20:20.583
-Why?
-You promised you'd quit.

00:20:20.666 --> 00:20:21.750
Tomorrow.

00:20:21.833 --> 00:20:23.500
No, give them to me now.

00:20:27.791 --> 00:20:28.625
Mom.

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:32.083
Mom!

00:20:42.125 --> 00:20:42.958
A-Jen.

00:20:44.916 --> 00:20:46.833
You've worked here for so many years.

00:20:47.541 --> 00:20:49.375
You haven't changed at all.

00:20:49.458 --> 00:20:50.625
Your attitude…

00:20:50.708 --> 00:20:51.625
Let me ask you,

00:20:52.458 --> 00:20:54.166
when is my goddaughter back?

00:20:58.416 --> 00:21:00.000
She lives in there now?

00:21:05.291 --> 00:21:07.333
I don't feel like chatting. Maybe later.

00:21:07.416 --> 00:21:10.125
Fine. If you don't feel like it, we won't.

00:21:10.208 --> 00:21:11.541
Let's talk about the case.

00:21:11.625 --> 00:21:12.541
Sure.

00:21:15.291 --> 00:21:17.375
CHANG CHIEH, CHIEF OF CRIME INVESTIGATION

00:21:17.458 --> 00:21:19.375
On the Liu Yen-hua drowning case,

00:21:20.166 --> 00:21:21.375
what are your thoughts?

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.416
Liu Yen-hua and Wei Meng-yen
knew each other.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.000
They're both influencers.

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:30.208
I think their deaths
are part of the same case.

00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:33.916
Serial murder?

00:21:35.375 --> 00:21:36.500
The killer is smart.

00:21:36.583 --> 00:21:39.750
He arranged for Wei Meng-yen
to come to the police station,

00:21:39.833 --> 00:21:41.375
hoping we'd kill him.

00:21:41.458 --> 00:21:42.958
-Put the gun down.
-Stay back!

00:21:43.041 --> 00:21:44.416
Put the gun down, okay?

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.333
Calm down.

00:21:45.416 --> 00:21:46.333
Put the gun down!

00:21:48.958 --> 00:21:51.125
Then he killed Liu Yen-hua himself.

00:21:57.208 --> 00:22:00.000
Is he trying to mess
with our investigation?

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.791
I don't think it's that simple.

00:22:02.875 --> 00:22:03.916
This whole thing

00:22:04.458 --> 00:22:05.791
has only just started.

00:22:05.875 --> 00:22:06.958
I think

00:22:07.666 --> 00:22:09.625
we should bring him in for questioning,

00:22:09.708 --> 00:22:11.750
and check out his background.

00:22:12.291 --> 00:22:13.625
Got it.

00:22:14.708 --> 00:22:17.541
Also, what did you tell the higher-ups?

00:22:19.083 --> 00:22:21.958
I've put your disciplinary action
on hold for now.

00:22:22.583 --> 00:22:25.375
Let's see how it goes
with Wei Meng-yen first.

00:22:25.458 --> 00:22:27.458
I'm retiring in two years.

00:22:27.541 --> 00:22:29.333
If you don't solve this,

00:22:30.083 --> 00:22:32.250
we'll all lose our jobs, okay?

00:22:33.708 --> 00:22:34.541
Okay.

00:22:36.125 --> 00:22:37.250
Got it.

00:22:37.333 --> 00:22:38.333
…ruling of homicide.

00:22:38.416 --> 00:22:42.791
Sources say Wa Tsai was due to film
with influencers Hippo and Braised Egg.

00:22:42.875 --> 00:22:44.416
But he never showed up.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.583
Police have obtained footage
from nearby surveillance cameras.

00:22:47.666 --> 00:22:50.333
The exact cause of death is still pending.

00:22:50.416 --> 00:22:52.416
That's the latest from us.

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:00.416
I'll slice some fruit.

00:23:02.041 --> 00:23:03.375
Okay. Thank you, Mrs. Wei.

00:23:45.166 --> 00:23:46.083
What the hell?

00:23:49.208 --> 00:23:50.375
Shit.

00:23:50.458 --> 00:23:51.791
Hey, slow down.

00:23:52.291 --> 00:23:53.708
I can't hit it…

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:05.916
-Let's go.
-Come on…

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:06.833
-What?
-Let's go.

00:24:06.916 --> 00:24:08.083
Come on. Let's go.

00:24:08.166 --> 00:24:10.291
-Hey, Ting-yu, hurry!
-Go!

00:24:10.958 --> 00:24:11.791
Go!

00:24:30.166 --> 00:24:31.791
Are you Wei Meng-yen's family?

00:24:31.875 --> 00:24:32.708
Yes.

00:24:32.791 --> 00:24:35.166
I'm Ho Chen-wei,
High-Tech Crime Unit squad leader.

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:36.791
I need to check his phone.

00:24:36.875 --> 00:24:39.083
You guys shot my son.

00:24:39.166 --> 00:24:42.250
The case has expanded.
We need to seize his phone.

00:24:42.333 --> 00:24:45.500
Officer, wait.
You can't just walk into a patient's room!

00:24:45.583 --> 00:24:46.875
-I'll get going.
-Already?

00:24:46.958 --> 00:24:48.458
Yes. I'll be back tomorrow.

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:56.083
-Is this his phone?
-You can't just take his stuff.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.916
Are you his attending physician?

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.375
I'm his ER physician.

00:25:13.958 --> 00:25:15.750
Okay, please register here.

00:25:16.375 --> 00:25:18.250
I need to register now?

00:25:18.333 --> 00:25:21.125
Only the attending physician
and family can visit him.

00:25:21.208 --> 00:25:22.208
I'll ask his family.

00:25:22.291 --> 00:25:24.791
It's okay. Don't worry.
I'll get to work. Thanks.

00:25:28.458 --> 00:25:29.875
Door closing.

00:25:29.958 --> 00:25:31.750
Hey, come pick me up.

00:25:31.833 --> 00:25:32.791
Where are you?

00:25:32.875 --> 00:25:34.458
At the hospital.

00:25:34.541 --> 00:25:36.000
Did you see the Wa Tsai news?

00:25:36.083 --> 00:25:37.333
I did.

00:25:38.791 --> 00:25:40.791
Shit, how did this happen?

00:25:41.333 --> 00:25:43.583
Have any cops asked you about Wa Tsai?

00:25:44.083 --> 00:25:44.958
No.

00:25:45.041 --> 00:25:46.958
If they do, don't say anything.

00:25:47.041 --> 00:25:49.250
No shit.
Fuck, I doubt they'll find anything.

00:25:49.333 --> 00:25:50.166
Damn it.

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:52.041
They can't find shit, those losers.

00:25:52.125 --> 00:25:54.791
The losers
couldn't even tell it was a BB gun.

00:25:54.875 --> 00:25:56.583
-What were the idiots doing?
-Yeah.

00:25:56.666 --> 00:25:58.875
They shot him in the fucking chest.

00:25:58.958 --> 00:26:00.708
-Right.
-And they went to the hospital.

00:26:00.791 --> 00:26:03.125
Shit, do they have shit for brains?

00:26:03.208 --> 00:26:04.500
-Are cops so great?
-Exactly.

00:26:04.583 --> 00:26:06.458
He calls us losers? He's a loser.

00:26:06.541 --> 00:26:08.458
Those losers can all go to hell.

00:26:08.541 --> 00:26:10.333
Let's see what they do next.

00:26:10.416 --> 00:26:11.500
Fucking idiots.

00:26:11.583 --> 00:26:14.041
I'll be ready for him, if he even dares.

00:26:14.125 --> 00:26:16.958
They wouldn't dare. That would be suicide.

00:26:17.541 --> 00:26:20.750
I have millions of followers.
One spit each, and he'd drown.

00:26:20.833 --> 00:26:21.708
Not even.

00:26:21.791 --> 00:26:23.541
Fuck, my spit alone is enough.

00:26:24.375 --> 00:26:25.833
Damn, you have that much saliva?

00:26:25.916 --> 00:26:27.583
Hell yeah. I'll spit it all out.

00:26:27.666 --> 00:26:29.375
I'll drown that motherfucker.

00:26:29.458 --> 00:26:31.250
First floor.

00:26:31.916 --> 00:26:33.250
What are you looking at?

00:26:33.333 --> 00:26:34.166
What?

00:26:35.791 --> 00:26:37.125
Hurry up and pick me up.

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:42.291
What do you want?

00:26:42.375 --> 00:26:44.250
I don't know anything.

00:26:50.958 --> 00:26:52.458
WA TSAI

00:26:54.833 --> 00:26:57.625
TING-YU

00:26:58.875 --> 00:27:00.083
You're Lin Ting-yu?

00:27:01.333 --> 00:27:02.500
Yes.

00:27:04.708 --> 00:27:06.083
Before your buddy

00:27:06.166 --> 00:27:07.750
passed away,

00:27:07.833 --> 00:27:10.541
you called him 13 times, didn't you?

00:27:11.541 --> 00:27:13.041
He wasn't picking up.

00:27:16.875 --> 00:27:17.958
Do you guys have…

00:27:18.666 --> 00:27:19.791
any mutual friends?

00:27:19.875 --> 00:27:21.541
I don't know.

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:24.750
What Facebook group are you both in?

00:27:27.666 --> 00:27:29.208
Seriously? Facebook?

00:27:29.291 --> 00:27:32.208
Who uses Facebook anymore?
We all use Instagram.

00:27:48.125 --> 00:27:50.291
Is it this one?

00:27:52.208 --> 00:27:53.041
This one.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.416
ALL SET. WHEN'S PICKUP?

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:02.416
ON MY WAY NOW

00:28:05.041 --> 00:28:06.208
Who's Little Armstrong?

00:28:07.583 --> 00:28:08.916
I don't know.

00:28:09.458 --> 00:28:10.833
What's his real name?

00:28:10.916 --> 00:28:12.583
I don't know.

00:28:13.708 --> 00:28:15.375
Okay, let's go. Come on.

00:28:16.458 --> 00:28:17.500
Let's go.

00:28:17.583 --> 00:28:18.541
Let go.

00:28:20.208 --> 00:28:21.666
Chen Chih-chiang.

00:28:32.625 --> 00:28:34.666
Hello? Can you hear me?

00:28:35.291 --> 00:28:36.416
Do me a favor.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:37.791
-Okay. Sure.
-Alright.

00:28:37.875 --> 00:28:39.875
Find someone named Chen Chih-chiang.

00:28:41.166 --> 00:28:43.166
He's linked to the Liu Yen-hua homicide.

00:28:46.166 --> 00:28:47.291
Hurry up.

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:52.583
Yes.

00:28:55.541 --> 00:28:56.750
I need the address.

00:28:57.333 --> 00:28:59.416
I know the address.

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:00.458
Houde Road.

00:29:00.541 --> 00:29:03.166
No. 478, Houde Road. Chen Chih-chiang.

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:04.958
-Call me if you can't find him.
-Hey.

00:29:05.041 --> 00:29:06.125
I have to film.

00:29:06.208 --> 00:29:07.500
Hello? I'm on my way.

00:29:07.583 --> 00:29:08.833
The address is…

00:29:10.041 --> 00:29:13.375
LITTLE ARMSTRONG FILMS VIDEOS

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:15.375
Hello, everyone.

00:29:15.458 --> 00:29:16.541
I'm Witch Baba.

00:29:17.375 --> 00:29:18.750
What does a witch do?

00:29:18.833 --> 00:29:19.958
I

00:29:20.041 --> 00:29:21.750
can see

00:29:21.833 --> 00:29:22.833
the future.

00:29:22.916 --> 00:29:24.125
See the future?

00:29:25.833 --> 00:29:27.291
You read fortunes, too?

00:29:27.375 --> 00:29:28.333
That's right.

00:29:30.458 --> 00:29:31.625
Two of Clubs upright.

00:29:32.291 --> 00:29:33.416
Nine of Hearts reversed.

00:29:34.291 --> 00:29:36.000
Ten of Clubs upright.

00:29:36.958 --> 00:29:38.166
In your future,

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:39.666
you'll eat

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:41.375
a lot of potato chips!

00:29:42.875 --> 00:29:44.125
You call that a reading?

00:29:45.416 --> 00:29:46.583
Upright.

00:29:46.666 --> 00:29:47.958
Reversed.

00:29:48.041 --> 00:29:49.125
Upright.

00:29:49.916 --> 00:29:52.208
To me, they're exactly the same.

00:29:52.291 --> 00:29:55.000
You shouldn't trick people
like that, miss.

00:29:55.083 --> 00:29:56.750
And, for Christ's sake,

00:29:56.833 --> 00:29:59.000
you look terrible in that mask.

00:30:00.375 --> 00:30:01.208
Take it off!

00:30:06.708 --> 00:30:08.375
Potato chips?

00:30:08.458 --> 00:30:11.041
I think you're full of shit.

00:30:12.375 --> 00:30:13.625
All right, okay.

00:30:13.708 --> 00:30:15.083
Very good.

00:30:15.166 --> 00:30:16.375
Thank you, guys.

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:19.958
Let's go over it later.

00:30:20.041 --> 00:30:21.041
Sure, okay.

00:30:21.833 --> 00:30:23.541
Okay, time to eat. Thank you.

00:30:24.083 --> 00:30:25.250
Hey.

00:30:26.291 --> 00:30:27.666
The cops will be here soon.

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:29.333
What'd you tell Wa Tsai to get?

00:30:29.416 --> 00:30:31.333
The cops? To get what?

00:30:35.875 --> 00:30:38.708
The last message Wa Tsai received
came from you.

00:30:39.208 --> 00:30:42.083
-What did you want him to get?
-Why do you have his phone?

00:30:54.666 --> 00:30:57.958
CALLING LI HSIN-PING

00:30:58.041 --> 00:31:01.000
TAIPEI CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT
EVIDENCE BAG

00:31:01.083 --> 00:31:02.250
Hello, Mr. Jen?

00:31:02.333 --> 00:31:04.458
Trace Liu Yen-hua's phone location for me.

00:31:04.541 --> 00:31:05.375
What?

00:31:10.791 --> 00:31:11.916
Newspapers?

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:12.833
Yeah.

00:31:12.916 --> 00:31:15.416
Wa Tsai was meant
to pick them up yesterday.

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:16.916
Why would he need them?

00:31:17.541 --> 00:31:20.041
These are all articles
on Witch Baba's predictions.

00:31:20.625 --> 00:31:22.083
He was investigating her too.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000
BIG FOREST FIRE FINALLY EXTINGUISHED

00:31:25.083 --> 00:31:26.958
Why was he so curious about her?

00:31:28.041 --> 00:31:30.125
Could he have contacted Witch Baba?

00:31:30.875 --> 00:31:31.791
Hey.

00:31:31.875 --> 00:31:33.791
Does Witch Baba have a fan page?

00:31:33.875 --> 00:31:34.875
No.

00:31:34.958 --> 00:31:36.916
-She doesn't even have Instagram.
-What?

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.708
She's only active on UTurn.

00:31:38.791 --> 00:31:41.416
UTurn? Then the messages
would connect to Umail.

00:31:43.833 --> 00:31:44.958
Hey, you're right.

00:31:46.625 --> 00:31:49.875
"Did you tell Wei Yen
to shoot at the police station?"

00:31:49.958 --> 00:31:51.375
RE: MESSAGES FROM WA TSAI

00:31:51.458 --> 00:31:53.916
"How exactly did you control Wei Yen?"

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:16.250
That escalated quickly.

00:32:16.333 --> 00:32:18.833
-Did Witch Baba reply?
-Yeah, she did.

00:32:19.875 --> 00:32:23.625
"Thank you for your support.
Witch Baba will keep making good content.

00:32:23.708 --> 00:32:25.416
Please keep following Witch Baba."

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.041
-Shit.
-This is just a bot reply.

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:30.000
No, look at this.

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:33.958
This isn't a signature file.

00:32:34.041 --> 00:32:35.333
Is Lin Ting-yu here?

00:32:35.833 --> 00:32:37.000
Lin Ting-yu?

00:32:38.541 --> 00:32:39.500
Who is that?

00:32:40.166 --> 00:32:41.125
Never mind.

00:32:42.416 --> 00:32:43.541
Lin Ting-yu?

00:32:48.541 --> 00:32:49.958
What the fuck is this?

00:32:57.458 --> 00:32:59.625
-You're making this call?
-The cop is here.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.083
Gosh!

00:33:05.166 --> 00:33:06.833
This is a lady's place!

00:33:06.916 --> 00:33:08.541
-What are you doing?
-Move.

00:33:08.625 --> 00:33:10.166
You…gosh!

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:12.625
Did you just push me? Hey, sir.

00:33:13.375 --> 00:33:15.458
What's a guy doing in here?

00:33:18.833 --> 00:33:19.708
Hurry up.

00:33:19.791 --> 00:33:20.625
Go now.

00:33:33.166 --> 00:33:34.291
No one's here.

00:33:35.625 --> 00:33:36.791
Look carefully.

00:33:38.541 --> 00:33:39.583
No one's here.

00:33:43.166 --> 00:33:44.000
Shit.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:45.958
Give me the laptop.

00:33:52.208 --> 00:33:54.291
What's Wa Tsai got to do with Witch Baba?

00:33:54.916 --> 00:33:56.250
How would I know?

00:33:58.666 --> 00:34:00.166
First, it was Wei Yen.

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:01.541
Then it was Wa Tsai.

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:04.041
Will the next one be…

00:34:04.625 --> 00:34:05.833
Don't overthink it.

00:34:05.916 --> 00:34:07.333
Give me your phone.

00:34:07.416 --> 00:34:09.166
-What for?
-Don't ask.

00:34:13.625 --> 00:34:15.125
KAO PI, THIS IS YO TZU YO! YO!

00:34:15.208 --> 00:34:17.750
-Why are you leaving the group?
-Shut up.

00:34:22.083 --> 00:34:26.250
Lao Gao talked about
embedding encrypted messages in images.

00:34:27.208 --> 00:34:28.750
We just need to drag the image

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.708
into a text editor.

00:34:34.041 --> 00:34:35.041
There we go.

00:34:35.916 --> 00:34:37.416
It's all garbled.

00:34:38.166 --> 00:34:39.416
At the very bottom.

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.041
Shit, what the fuck is this?

00:34:49.791 --> 00:34:50.916
It's English.

00:34:52.291 --> 00:34:53.500
English, my ass.

00:34:55.333 --> 00:34:58.333
Do I look like I speak English?

00:34:58.416 --> 00:35:00.166
No way that's English.

00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:02.000
Hey, my English isn't great either.

00:35:02.083 --> 00:35:03.500
Ask Braised Egg if you want.

00:35:03.583 --> 00:35:05.458
I told you, it's not English.

00:35:05.541 --> 00:35:08.166
Wait, why exactly did you come to us?

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:10.000
I'm begging you guys.

00:35:10.083 --> 00:35:12.541
Don't you run that urban legend channel?

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:16.875
Fine.

00:35:16.958 --> 00:35:19.958
This looks like an Indo-European language.

00:35:20.041 --> 00:35:23.166
It's one of the most
widespread languages in the world.

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:24.750
It even looks encrypted.

00:35:24.833 --> 00:35:25.958
I don't care.

00:35:26.041 --> 00:35:26.916
The point is,

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.416
Wa Tsai was killed
right after seeing this.

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:31.250
There must be a secret in it.

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:35.458
There are over
400 Indo-European languages.

00:35:35.541 --> 00:35:38.500
How can I translate it
if you don't know which one it is?

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:42.541
Hey, alright.

00:35:42.625 --> 00:35:46.083
The coolest thing about Witch Baba
is probably her card deck, right?

00:35:46.166 --> 00:35:47.541
Which card deck?

00:35:47.625 --> 00:35:49.958
The one she uses to make predictions.

00:35:51.583 --> 00:35:52.541
This one.

00:35:53.125 --> 00:35:54.708
Illuminati Cards.

00:35:55.291 --> 00:35:56.375
I've heard of them.

00:36:00.208 --> 00:36:01.250
What?

00:36:03.291 --> 00:36:07.083
The Illuminati Cards
were originally just a card game.

00:36:07.166 --> 00:36:08.916
But someone discovered that the images

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.875
predicted 911, the Chernobyl disaster.

00:36:11.958 --> 00:36:16.041
the attack on the Pentagon,
and Trump getting elected, etc.

00:36:16.125 --> 00:36:17.583
Can you buy them in Taiwan?

00:36:18.166 --> 00:36:19.833
The thing is, you can't buy them.

00:36:19.916 --> 00:36:21.958
They're only available on the dark web.

00:36:22.041 --> 00:36:25.000
You can't buy them?
But I think I saw an unboxing video.

00:36:25.083 --> 00:36:26.166
-It was…
-Who was it?

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:27.708
Was it Wan-wan? Or…

00:36:29.958 --> 00:36:31.166
Sorry, I can't remember.

00:36:32.541 --> 00:36:34.125
Think harder, will you?

00:36:34.208 --> 00:36:36.000
The images on the Illuminati Cards

00:36:36.083 --> 00:36:39.333
are almost the same
as Baba Vanga's predictions.

00:36:39.416 --> 00:36:43.333
That's why people say they were drawn
based on Baba Vanga's predictions.

00:36:43.916 --> 00:36:45.666
Who is Baba Vanga?

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:48.833
The greatest psychic of the 20th century.

00:36:49.333 --> 00:36:50.583
She was a blind old lady.

00:36:50.666 --> 00:36:52.000
-That's right.…
-Yes.

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:55.208
So, Witch Baba got her name from her?

00:36:55.291 --> 00:36:56.416
For sure, where else?

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:57.666
That's quite possible.

00:36:58.458 --> 00:36:59.541
Where was she from?

00:37:01.583 --> 00:37:02.458
Where was it…

00:37:03.333 --> 00:37:04.541
Bulgaria.

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:09.583
Bulgaria, Cyrillic, Bulgaria…

00:37:10.083 --> 00:37:10.916
BULGARIAN

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.291

00:37:15.333 --> 00:37:16.750
Hey, check this out.

00:37:16.833 --> 00:37:17.750
Well…

00:37:17.833 --> 00:37:19.666
-"C, H, Chuan".
-How to pronounce it?

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:21.250
-"Chuan"?
- "Chuan", "Chiang"

00:37:21.333 --> 00:37:23.208
-"Chuan Chun…"
-"Chiang…"

00:37:23.291 --> 00:37:24.458
-"Chuan…"
-"Chen Chieh…"

00:37:24.541 --> 00:37:25.541
"Chen…"

00:37:25.625 --> 00:37:27.625
-Chen Chia-jen.
-"Chen, yuan, chen…"

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:54.916
Fuck, that hurts.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.958
You were trying to kill me.

00:38:57.041 --> 00:38:58.875
Correct. I do want to kill you.

00:38:58.958 --> 00:39:01.375
You stole evidence. I could've killed you.

00:39:01.458 --> 00:39:03.041
Of course you want to kill me.

00:39:03.125 --> 00:39:05.208
You and Witch Baba are in cahoots.

00:39:06.333 --> 00:39:07.541
Say that again.

00:39:08.125 --> 00:39:09.666
You two are in cahoots.

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:12.208
-We're in cahoots?
-What?

00:39:12.291 --> 00:39:13.916
-Influencer? Predictions?
-Let go!

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.791
Influencer? If I could predict things,
I'd predict you going to jail!

00:39:17.875 --> 00:39:18.708
What…

00:39:18.791 --> 00:39:21.500
I have evidence
that you and Witch Baba are in cahoots!

00:39:21.583 --> 00:39:22.791
Let go!

00:39:25.083 --> 00:39:26.416
Where's the evidence?

00:39:27.083 --> 00:39:28.375
Here. See for yourself.

00:39:31.583 --> 00:39:34.958
Witch Baba sent this encrypted message
to Wa Tsai in Bulgarian.

00:39:36.208 --> 00:39:37.666
This is the translation.

00:39:42.208 --> 00:39:43.583
Now you're speechless?

00:39:45.916 --> 00:39:47.583

Chiu-chiu.

00:40:27.875 --> 00:40:29.125
Fuck, not again.

00:40:30.166 --> 00:40:32.958
WITCH BABA

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.041
Hello, everyone.

00:40:38.125 --> 00:40:39.750
I'm Witch Baba.

00:40:39.833 --> 00:40:43.291
I predicted someone would die
from drowning yesterday.

00:40:43.875 --> 00:40:46.291
I'm really sorry.

00:40:46.375 --> 00:40:48.041
We're still going to…

00:40:48.125 --> 00:40:49.583
We're still going to

00:40:49.666 --> 00:40:52.000
draw the next prediction.

00:40:52.583 --> 00:40:54.125
Obelisk reversed.

00:40:54.708 --> 00:40:56.875
Orient Express upright.

00:40:56.958 --> 00:40:58.833
Amazonia reversed.

00:41:00.333 --> 00:41:01.333
In the future…

00:41:02.458 --> 00:41:06.166
In the future,
someone will be stabbed to death.

00:45:09.083 --> 00:45:13.291
