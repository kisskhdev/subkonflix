WEBVTT

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.719
Time to eat.

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:51.719
There's wine too.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.879
Take a bowl.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.680
Prepared especially for you.

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.439
Take your time eating and drinking.

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:04.079
There's meat and wine.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.959
Could this be our last meal?

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.959
You can't have a last meal every time.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.239
True.

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:12.879
Come on.

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:13.799
Drink up.

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:17.759
They aren't very

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
friendly to us.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.879
Why?

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.080
There's dishes and wine,

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.680
but no rice.

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.599
Come, come, come.

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:26.680
We'll treat wine as our rice.

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:27.240
Cheers.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.439
This Fan Sha'er really is quite a character.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.960
He actually caused a stir all the way to Chengdu Prefecture.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.879
His heroic deeds are spreading within Sichuan.

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.400
The common folk hail him as an Anti-Japanese Hero.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.319
If he can be of use to me...

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.039
we can use the banner of the Anti-Japanese Hero

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:45.080
to recruit soldiers and build our forces.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.120
Those wealthy merchants and bosses,

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.599
won't they be lining up to send me money?

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:52.560
However,

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:53.919
he is currently locked up in

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:55.240
the prison in Chengdu Prefecture.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.479
The Japanese won't let him off.

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:00.719
Just don't know how General Liu will handle it.

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:05.400
He dared to kill those Japanese bastards.

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:07.280
He is a hero.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.080
This Lucky General...

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:12.080
I'm determined to have him.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.400
Understood.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.840
Commander Liao, please go back.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.960
General Liu is critically ill.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.960
He won't see anyone.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.240
Kill.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.759
Kill! Kill!

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.560
Kill him tomorrow!

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:25.159
Whoever dares plead for his release in front of me,

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.840
I won't let them off!

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:28.199
General Liu,

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:29.719
public outrage is huge right now.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.240
I'm afraid if we execute him,

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.520
we won't be able to control the fallout.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.319
Quelling the riots is the priority.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.039
Take the troops, the police...

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.479
if you're short on hands,

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.520
there are also the prison guards.

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.240
Call them all out.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.919
Assemble all forces.

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:47.800
Go to the streets tomorrow

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.039
to suppress the unruly rioters.

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:53.199
Thank you for your instructions, General Liu.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.759
It seems Commander Liao is determined to get him.

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:10.319
Are you so sure Commander Liao will act to save him?

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:12.240
Securing Fan Sha'er

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.159
is equivalent to winning the hearts of the people.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.719
Then we can conscript soldiers and collect taxes,

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.520
and accept support from merchants.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.240
Such a good deal,

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.839
Commander Liao has no reason not to do it.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.120
Besides, General Liu

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:28.040
has always advocated resistance against Japan.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.439
Arresting Fan Sha'er now

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.480
is like poking a hornet's nest.

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:34.759
It's a bit tricky.

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:40.199
The higher-ups...

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.839
since they dare not openly protect him,

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:44.600
then...

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.160
we will openly snatch him.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.079
Could it be...

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.319
it's General Zhang's will?

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:01.240
Guessing my thoughts is one thing,

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:02.839
but General Zhang

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:04.439
is beyond your reach.

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:06.560
I wouldn't dare.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.680
Make the most of this.

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:12.199
Fan Sha'er has no way out.

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:15.120
It's the best opportunity to win him over.

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:28.839
The key dropped.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.439
We're rushing out on a mission.

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:33.000
You lot, behave yourselves.

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:34.040
Take care.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.240
Let's go, out on duty.

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:44.319
Go deal with...

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:45.639
those troublemakers on the street.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.079
Let's go.

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:55.319
You guys wait for me here.

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:57.040
We must get Big Brother Fan out.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.639
Don't worry.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.879
First Brother.

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:01.000
It's too dangerous.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.319
I'll go with you.

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:03.399
We can look out for each other.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.959
No need.

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:05.639
You have a more important mission.

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:07.279
Protect Sister-in-law.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.120
Alright.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.800
Get ready to move.

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:14.480
Beat them to death for me.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.439
Sister-in-law, I'm going.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.360
Be careful.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.759
Stay safe.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.959
Scarface, believe it or not...

00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:47.279
with just one finger...

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:49.000
I can unlock this.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.120
I don't believe it.

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:52.600
You don't?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.759
Then pick up the key and open it.

00:06:58.199 --> 00:06:59.040
Is that what you mean?

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.199
Big Brother.

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:15.199
How did you get out? Let's go.

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:16.560
Why did you bring so many people?

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:17.959
I don't know them.

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:21.360
Boss Fan.

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:25.519
Young Master Huo.

00:07:25.959 --> 00:07:27.720
I'm here to take your life.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.759
You trying to play games with me?

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:34.800
I...

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.319
Watch me beat the life out of you.

00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:54.680
Dare to intercept my goods.

00:07:54.959 --> 00:07:55.920
Your goods?

00:07:56.839 --> 00:07:57.680
Don't make a move!

00:07:57.839 --> 00:07:59.199
If you do, we all die!

00:08:00.519 --> 00:08:01.639
Don't be afraid, Brother.

00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:02.680
I'll protect you.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.319
Protect you?

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.800
I said let go!

00:09:17.919 --> 00:09:19.159
It's you.

00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:20.159
Let's go.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.840
Take you to see Commander Liao.

00:09:23.639 --> 00:09:24.519
Commander Liao?

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:27.840
Let's go.

00:09:33.879 --> 00:09:34.360
Go.

00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:41.799
Stop.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.120
Hide!

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.120
Quick!

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:01.679
Another group is coming.

00:10:01.679 --> 00:10:02.399
Prepare for battle.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.200
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.879
Sister-in-law.

00:10:08.879 --> 00:10:09.720
Don't you move.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.120
Who is it?

00:10:12.399 --> 00:10:13.559
It's me, Xuanjizi.

00:10:13.799 --> 00:10:15.159
It's you?

00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:20.440
Last time you kept telling me to go west.

00:10:20.759 --> 00:10:21.919
And I ended up here.

00:10:22.039 --> 00:10:23.200
That's your problem.

00:10:24.639 --> 00:10:26.639
I calculated the best rescue time was Midnight.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.120
How come someone beat me to it at the Hour of the Pig?

00:10:29.639 --> 00:10:30.840
When have your calculations ever been right?

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:34.879
Go, go, go. Follow me.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.320
Listen to you again?

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:37.679
Let's go.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.159
Go. Let's get out first.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.840
We travel for another two days.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.960
We'll be safe once we reach Division Commander Wei's territory.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:49.799
Division Commander Wei?

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.440
To tell you the truth,

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.320
I am Division Commander Wei's staff officer.

00:10:54.519 --> 00:10:55.519
My mission

00:10:55.799 --> 00:10:57.399
is to help him recruit heroes from all over.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.840
When we parted ways last time,

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:01.519
didn't I give you a Tiger-Head Token?

00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:02.879
And told you to keep going west?

00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:05.480
Actually, I wanted you to join Division Commander Wei.

00:11:06.159 --> 00:11:07.360
That Brotherhood of yours,

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.279
although you do chivalrous deeds,

00:11:10.759 --> 00:11:12.559
they still consider you a bandit.

00:11:12.879 --> 00:11:15.159
The only end for a bandit is to be wiped out.

00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:17.279
If you join Division Commander Wei,

00:11:17.559 --> 00:11:19.679
you can still do what you want to do.

00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:21.759
Once you put on the uniform,

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.600
you become a righteous army.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.360
What exactly does that Tiger-Head Token mean?

00:11:27.799 --> 00:11:30.000
That's the token agreed upon between the Commander and me.

00:11:30.679 --> 00:11:32.120
It's the design of the tattoo on his body.

00:11:37.759 --> 00:11:38.559
Did you hear that?

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:39.799
Tattoo design.

00:11:40.519 --> 00:11:41.320
Wearing a uniform.

00:11:42.039 --> 00:11:43.240
It's this guy named Wei.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.039
But Pockmarked Tiger

00:11:45.039 --> 00:11:46.360
didn't say his surname was Wei.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.919
I know another guy named Wei.

00:11:50.039 --> 00:11:51.879
Tattooed, and also wears a uniform.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.039
What do you mean?

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.639
Don't be impulsive.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.240
We killed people.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.799
And we killed Japanese people.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.879
Everyone is praising us as heroes, right?

00:12:00.039 --> 00:12:00.840
What are you afraid of?

00:12:01.399 --> 00:12:02.399
Heroes...

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.080
that's just talk.

00:12:07.159 --> 00:12:07.919
The Japanese

00:12:08.679 --> 00:12:10.240
definitely want our heads.

00:12:10.919 --> 00:12:12.279
And that Young Master Huo,

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.360
has been stirring up trouble.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.080
Right now, we

00:12:16.879 --> 00:12:18.799
must find a safe place to settle.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.519
What about Pockmarked Tiger's revenge?

00:12:22.559 --> 00:12:25.480
Even if Division Commander Wei is Pockmarked Tiger's enemy,

00:12:26.039 --> 00:12:28.320
we should go check out the situation.

00:12:28.799 --> 00:12:29.519
Don't worry.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.600
You promised Pockmarked Tiger,

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.360
and I promised her too.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.600
Alright, I believe you.

00:12:37.919 --> 00:12:39.679
I'll go meet this Division Commander Wei.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:47.600
Last night,

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.240
a riot broke out in the prison.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.200
The two murderers who killed your envoys

00:12:54.799 --> 00:12:55.919
met a violent end.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.480
A life for a life.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.799
Let us pursue this matter no further.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.000
General Liu,

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.279
settling it this way

00:13:08.879 --> 00:13:11.639
is a bit too hasty, isn't it?

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.639
We, the Japanese side, have the right to investigate.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.159
Mr. Tanaka,

00:13:17.759 --> 00:13:19.159
don't be in such a hurry.

00:13:19.919 --> 00:13:21.600
I haven't finished speaking yet.

00:13:22.879 --> 00:13:24.279
Sit. Sit, sit, sit.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.559
One.

00:13:29.639 --> 00:13:32.639
Our government will pay the Japanese side

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.039
compensation in Chinese currency:

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.679
98,871 yuan and 1 jiao.

00:13:40.279 --> 00:13:40.919
Two.

00:13:41.759 --> 00:13:43.639
To the families of the victims,

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.559
we express our deepest condolences.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:48.399
Three.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.000
Garrison Commander Jiang Shangpu

00:13:52.639 --> 00:13:55.320
and Police Chief Fan Zhongwu

00:13:55.559 --> 00:13:58.000
are dismissed for negligence.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.279
Four.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.720
I, on behalf of the government,

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.360
express to your government

00:14:07.559 --> 00:14:09.240
our most sincere apologies.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:16.879
This...

00:14:17.279 --> 00:14:19.639
it was just an unexpected incident.

00:14:21.519 --> 00:14:23.679
If we let this situation escalate,

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.559
it won't be good for either of us.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.360
General Liu,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.799
we shall meet again.

00:14:35.759 --> 00:14:38.320
Once I've reclaimed our lost lands,

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.519
I will certainly invite you over, Mr. Tanaka.

00:14:50.159 --> 00:14:50.759
Please, come inside.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:51.279
Okay.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.519
You guys wait here a moment.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.759
I'll go report to the Division Commander.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.159
Brother, it's quite impressive.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:08.879
Indeed.

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.320
So what if it's impressive?

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:11.919
There's hardly anyone here.

00:15:12.159 --> 00:15:13.120
It's all show.

00:15:13.559 --> 00:15:14.720
And he's a Division Commander?

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.200
Doesn't seem like much to me.

00:15:22.159 --> 00:15:22.840
I...

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.399
You guys wait here first.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.480
I'm going to relieve myself.

00:15:50.879 --> 00:15:51.919
Cheapskate.

00:16:45.879 --> 00:16:47.080
Wei San!

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:49.559
Brother!

00:16:54.039 --> 00:16:55.200
You're a soldier here?

00:16:56.639 --> 00:16:58.360
Why... why are you here?

00:16:59.240 --> 00:16:59.879
Me?

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.240
Your Division Commander invited me.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:05.919
Not bad, not bad.

00:17:06.519 --> 00:17:07.960
Come with me, quick.

00:17:08.399 --> 00:17:10.119
I'll introduce the Division Commander to you.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:11.839
How about this,

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.160
let me go put on my clothes first.

00:17:13.279 --> 00:17:14.200
What clothes?

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:15.920
The Division Commander won't wait.

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:17.039
Let's go, now.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.079
Salute!

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:25.200
Look, your Division Commander values me so much.

00:17:30.559 --> 00:17:31.799
Let me introduce everyone.

00:17:32.279 --> 00:17:34.759
This is my sworn brother, Wei San.

00:17:35.519 --> 00:17:36.440
Brother Wei, Brother Wei.

00:17:36.799 --> 00:17:37.559
Good, good, good.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.720
Hasn't Xuanjizi brought the Division Commander out yet?

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:42.359
No.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:43.200
Follow me.

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:44.440
I can find the way.

00:17:45.559 --> 00:17:46.000
Let's go.

00:17:46.519 --> 00:17:46.799
Go.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.440
Let's go.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.599
Double time!

00:17:53.519 --> 00:17:54.359
Salute!

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.160
Hello, sir!

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.920
Hello, sir!

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:04.839
Hello, everyone.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.720
Thank you for your service, sir!

00:18:08.079 --> 00:18:09.559
Thank you all for yours.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.839
Left face! Right face!

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.839
The Commander will now speak.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.519
I won't speak. I won't speak.

00:18:18.519 --> 00:18:19.559
I don't even know them.

00:18:21.839 --> 00:18:22.880
Just say a few words.

00:18:24.079 --> 00:18:24.880
Come on. Please, please.

00:18:25.839 --> 00:18:26.359
Alright.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.960
My name is Fan Pengju.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.920
They all call me Sha'er.

00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:35.880
I may be simple-minded,

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.039
but I'm lucky.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.400
Enough about me.

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:41.039
Let's talk about my brother.

00:18:42.799 --> 00:18:44.480
I've bathed with him.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.079
We're sworn brothers.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:49.160
He...

00:18:49.839 --> 00:18:50.680
pretended to be a pig,

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.599
imitated a cuckoo,

00:18:54.319 --> 00:18:56.039
and even hid in my slop bucket.

00:18:56.599 --> 00:18:58.079
Come, come. Come up here.

00:18:58.799 --> 00:18:59.440
Okay, okay.

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.119
With his strong will,

00:19:04.319 --> 00:19:05.400
he evaded the pursuers.

00:19:06.359 --> 00:19:08.319
He is a hero who can adapt to anything.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.519
He deserves an important position.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.440
Hello, Division Commander!

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:14.640
As for Division Commander...

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.920
I can't handle such a high rank.

00:19:16.799 --> 00:19:19.160
But a Company or Battalion Commander would do.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.200
Division Commander.

00:19:21.559 --> 00:19:23.279
This is the Lucky General I found for you.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:24.880
Division Commander...

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.400
Wei San... Division Commander Wei.

00:19:30.559 --> 00:19:31.680
Hello, Division Commander.

00:19:33.759 --> 00:19:35.240
What a coincidence indeed.

00:19:37.079 --> 00:19:37.960
Greetings, soldiers!

00:19:38.519 --> 00:19:40.039
Hello, Division Commander!

00:19:40.359 --> 00:19:41.160
My adjutant betrayed me,

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.240
causing our army to suffer heavy losses.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.359
When I was in distress,

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.400
it was my sworn brother who came to my aid,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.279
and saved my life.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:51.960
My sworn brother...

00:19:52.279 --> 00:19:54.359
is the hero who killed the Japanese with his own hands.

00:19:54.759 --> 00:19:56.079
Today, he joins our army.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:57.960
I now announce...

00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.640
the appointment of Fan Pengju...

00:20:00.279 --> 00:20:01.759
as Colonel of our army.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.119
From now on,

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.720
our army will be even stronger,

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.720
and invincible!

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.799
Hello, Colonel Fan!

00:20:13.759 --> 00:20:14.720
You saved my life.

00:20:15.519 --> 00:20:17.359
From now on, entrust your life to me.

00:20:18.519 --> 00:20:19.279
I will protect it.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:22.680
My troops...

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.200
are your trump card,

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.240
and your strong backing.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:27.799
Because...

00:20:28.599 --> 00:20:30.160
we are life-and-death brothers.

00:20:33.559 --> 00:20:35.440
You stepped on my foot.

00:20:39.519 --> 00:20:40.200
Right.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:44.880
Good, good.

00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:48.839
Especially seeing my sworn brother in this uniform,

00:20:49.319 --> 00:20:50.200
looking so heroic.

00:20:50.359 --> 00:20:51.799
You really look like a Colonel.

00:20:53.119 --> 00:20:54.400
Come, sit, sit.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:58.799
I never expected...

00:20:59.079 --> 00:21:00.119
that the Lucky General I found...

00:21:00.119 --> 00:21:02.400
would be the Division Commander's sworn brother.

00:21:02.839 --> 00:21:03.359
Division Commander,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.039
I completed this mission pretty well, didn't I?

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:07.759
I should be heavily rewarded.

00:21:08.119 --> 00:21:08.799
Thank you, Division Commander.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.240
To help the Division Commander recruit heroes,

00:21:12.319 --> 00:21:15.079
and give Colonel Fan a place to show his talents,

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.640
is my, Xuanjizi's, wish.

00:21:17.119 --> 00:21:17.480
Come.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.119
I propose a toast to you both.

00:21:22.519 --> 00:21:23.960
Division Commander Wei, I toast to you.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.039
For the poor hospitality back in Qionglai Town,

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:26.960
please forgive me.

00:21:30.599 --> 00:21:32.000
I remember now.

00:21:34.519 --> 00:21:36.440
My sworn brother is truly lucky.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.039
To have such a supportive wife.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.160
Speaking of Qionglai,

00:21:39.359 --> 00:21:40.319
this Qiong liquor...

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.920
comes from your place, doesn't it?

00:21:42.119 --> 00:21:43.319
Come, come.

00:22:02.039 --> 00:22:02.880
Um,

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:04.880
inside the military camp,

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.559
can we raise children?

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.079
Raise children?

00:22:15.359 --> 00:22:16.279
Of course you can.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:17.759
This place is your home now.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.519
You two can have as many as you want.

00:22:21.119 --> 00:22:21.680
Division Commander Wei,

00:22:22.279 --> 00:22:23.119
let me toast you.

00:22:23.839 --> 00:22:25.200
Thank you for taking us in.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.799
We're all brothers here.

00:22:28.359 --> 00:22:29.680
No need for such formalities.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.400
So, Division Commander Wei,

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.240
do you remember Pockmarked Tiger?

00:22:37.359 --> 00:22:38.599
She was our local...

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.359
biggest bandit ringleader.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:41.720
She killed countless people

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:42.880
and committed all sorts of crimes.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.279
A woman like that...

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:45.519
you did well to kill her.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.880
Pockmarked Tiger was a woman?

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:54.960
Back then, to keep the peace,

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:55.839
it was I...

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.079
who sent her into the bandit's den.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:58.839
Tell me,

00:22:59.839 --> 00:23:00.880
did I do the right thing?

00:23:02.839 --> 00:23:03.519
Yes.

00:23:04.359 --> 00:23:05.240
Great job.

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.960
Bandits commit many crimes,

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.480
they deserve to die.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.440
For this, I must thank my sworn brother.

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:12.960
Killing Pockmarked Tiger

00:23:13.119 --> 00:23:14.400
removed a thorn in my side.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.240
Let's have a drink together.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.599
No, no, no.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.279
Brothers, let's toast our Division Commander together.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.720
Alright, come on.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:22.559
All together.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.000
Cheers.

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.720
First Brother, drink up.

00:23:34.519 --> 00:23:36.319
Under someone else's roof,

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:37.920
we absolutely cannot make a move.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:40.319
I promised Pockmarked Tiger.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.160
Even if we succeed,

00:23:42.599 --> 00:23:43.640
none of us will escape.

00:23:46.319 --> 00:23:47.279
Everyone is drinking.

00:23:47.359 --> 00:23:49.039
What are you two whispering about?

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.279
Come over and drink, hurry.

00:23:50.279 --> 00:23:51.440
Alright, alright.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.039
Although we are sworn brothers,

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.920
the military camp has its rules.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.240
If my sworn brother makes a mistake,

00:24:01.559 --> 00:24:02.680
and deserves a beating,

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.559
I will still have to beat him.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:05.599
Good.

00:24:06.319 --> 00:24:07.519
The Division Commander means,

00:24:08.119 --> 00:24:09.440
if the Division Commander makes a mistake,

00:24:09.799 --> 00:24:10.839
and we should spank his bottom,

00:24:11.039 --> 00:24:12.319
we still have to spank his bottom.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:16.960
Come, come on.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.359
Cheers.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:33.839
Let me wash your face for you.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:35.720
No need.

00:24:40.079 --> 00:24:41.240
Then let me wash your feet with hot water.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:42.519
No need.

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.359
During this time,

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.440
you've been working very hard too.

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.000
Go back to your own room and rest.

00:25:02.279 --> 00:25:04.000
Do you still think this is your turf?

00:25:05.039 --> 00:25:06.880
Would they prepare so many rooms for us?

00:25:10.039 --> 00:25:11.279
This is our room.

00:25:12.119 --> 00:25:12.599
Fine.

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.279
You stay here.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:18.240
I'll go squeeze in with First Brother and the others.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.640
Everyone knows I am your wife.

00:25:24.559 --> 00:25:25.559
Only you don't treat me as a wife.

00:25:25.559 --> 00:25:27.400
You married me with a proper wedding ceremony.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:29.880
Right now,

00:25:30.799 --> 00:25:33.160
Yu Zhen is pregnant with my child,

00:25:34.119 --> 00:25:34.960
all alone,

00:25:35.559 --> 00:25:36.759
wandering out there.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.680
I'm not in the mood.

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.480
Sister Yu Zhen leaving

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:42.839
was her own choice.

00:25:44.559 --> 00:25:46.559
I chose to follow you through life and death.

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.640
I know you're good to me.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:52.880
Everything...

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.960
let's wait until we find Yu Zhen.

00:26:16.599 --> 00:26:18.000
You failed the mission this time.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.960
This is already the lightest military punishment.

00:26:21.519 --> 00:26:23.119
I'd rather be beaten with a military club.

00:26:23.119 --> 00:26:24.480
Do you think you have a choice?

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.240
I am the dignified Young Master Huo.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.000
Commander Chen wants you to know

00:26:29.079 --> 00:26:30.519
that you are no longer some "Young Master".

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.200
Military rules are not a joke.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.559
Commander Chen even kept your position as Staff Officer.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.319
You should be content.

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:04.079
Eat up.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.799
Are you really not going to training?

00:27:06.359 --> 00:27:07.400
It's too intense.

00:27:08.279 --> 00:27:08.920
Can't handle it.

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.799
We're up mountains and down rivers all day.

00:27:11.799 --> 00:27:13.519
Do bodies like ours need training?

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:14.599
It's alright.

00:27:14.599 --> 00:27:15.640
I'll only believe that

00:27:15.799 --> 00:27:17.160
if they really call us to fight.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.799
Brother Fan! Brother Fan!

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:30.920
Why did you run over here?

00:27:31.839 --> 00:27:32.880
We saw this.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.839
And saw this.

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.559
We weren't sure if this was you.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:38.559
So we wanted to come take a look.

00:27:38.839 --> 00:27:40.279
And we actually found you.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:42.759
Brother, look.

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.359
They're all here because of your fame.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.480
You're a big hero now.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:48.160
Is that so?

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.920
The recruitment drive went well this time.

00:28:02.119 --> 00:28:03.079
It was very effective.

00:28:03.359 --> 00:28:05.000
I've lived up to your trust, haven't I?

00:28:10.359 --> 00:28:12.160
The Nanjing Government reached out to me.

00:28:12.839 --> 00:28:14.079
They even wired a check.

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.519
Asking me to attack Commander Liao's forces.

00:28:17.839 --> 00:28:18.519
How much did they give?

00:28:18.799 --> 00:28:19.279
A considerable sum.

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.160
Didn't they call for a ceasefire before?

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.000
Why are they asking for a fight now?

00:28:26.319 --> 00:28:27.279
The fighting did stop.

00:28:28.079 --> 00:28:30.200
But the disobedient remain disobedient.

00:28:30.799 --> 00:28:32.480
And those who don't pay taxes still don't.

00:28:33.119 --> 00:28:34.279
The higher-ups are furious.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.400
They want to make an example of Commander Liao.

00:28:36.799 --> 00:28:37.519
So, Division Commander,

00:28:37.519 --> 00:28:39.480
do you think we should fight this battle,

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.559
or not?

00:28:44.319 --> 00:28:46.359
They promised that if I send troops,

00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:49.119
I'll be incorporated into the Central Army.

00:28:50.599 --> 00:28:52.200
Behind Liao and Chen,

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.319
stand General Liu and General Zhang.

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.160
I'm just an unorthodox outsider.

00:28:57.559 --> 00:28:59.279
I've had enough of being squeezed in the middle.

00:29:01.839 --> 00:29:03.359
Since Colonel Fan joined us,

00:29:03.359 --> 00:29:04.440
our forces have grown stronger.

00:29:04.599 --> 00:29:06.359
We've collected plenty of money and grain.

00:29:07.119 --> 00:29:09.160
But even if we upgrade our equipment

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.119
and step up our training now,

00:29:10.559 --> 00:29:11.759
attacking Commander Liao's forces

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.440
might still be a risky move.

00:29:13.839 --> 00:29:15.319
No one said it has to be a sure win.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.160
Division Commander, for a risky battle,

00:29:19.599 --> 00:29:20.680
how should we fight it?

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.480
Why don't you all speak up?

00:29:27.279 --> 00:29:28.519
Any good suggestions?

00:29:29.519 --> 00:29:30.839
Who is the right person to go?

00:29:35.039 --> 00:29:37.680
This is a great chance to earn merit.

00:29:37.839 --> 00:29:38.759
I really want to go.

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.519
But we've followed Division Commander Wei for years.

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.480
We've dealt with Commander Liao's troops

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.200
on the battlefield many times.

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:48.240
His forces are too familiar with our tactics.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:51.000
It's hard to catch them by surprise.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.000
The newly arrived Colonel Fan,

00:29:53.519 --> 00:29:54.640
to Commander Liao's forces,

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.839
is a complete mystery.

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.720
He's known as a rare Lucky General.

00:30:00.079 --> 00:30:02.440
He joined us as an equal right away,

00:30:03.559 --> 00:30:05.519
so he must have exceptional abilities.

00:30:06.519 --> 00:30:07.559
Colonel Fan just arrived.

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.319
Regarding many military matters,

00:30:09.319 --> 00:30:11.400
he needs time to get up to speed.

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:12.279
We can't afford to be slow.

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.880
The battlefield is ever-changing.

00:30:15.119 --> 00:30:16.839
Victory or defeat is decided in an instant.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.440
If we're slow, the chance will slip away.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.079
Colonel Fan used to lead a bandit gang.

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.519
He counts as a commander of sorts.

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.799
He's just changed his uniform now.

00:30:27.039 --> 00:30:29.359
I trust Colonel Fan won't be rusty.

00:30:30.599 --> 00:30:32.759
This is Colonel Fan's first military operation

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.480
since joining our army.

00:30:35.079 --> 00:30:36.519
If I were Colonel Fan,

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.359
I wouldn't wait for Division Commander Wei's order.

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.599
I would have volunteered long ago.

00:30:41.799 --> 00:30:45.319
It's rare for you Colonels to be so in sync.

00:30:47.759 --> 00:30:48.960
What do you mean?

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.400
Do you have a problem with Colonel Fan?

00:30:55.519 --> 00:30:57.319
He is my sworn brother.

00:30:58.519 --> 00:31:00.000
The Colonel I personally appointed.

00:31:00.839 --> 00:31:02.039
Having a problem with him

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.680
is having a problem with me.

00:31:06.279 --> 00:31:08.359
I am willing to lead the troops.

00:31:08.839 --> 00:31:09.480
Colonel Fan.

00:31:10.119 --> 00:31:11.319
This won't be an easy battle.

00:31:11.599 --> 00:31:12.279
You haven't even

00:31:12.279 --> 00:31:13.599
organized your own troops yet.

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.920
My sworn brother is truly upright.

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.359
At a critical moment,

00:31:19.119 --> 00:31:20.160
you stand by me.

00:31:21.319 --> 00:31:22.000
Good.
