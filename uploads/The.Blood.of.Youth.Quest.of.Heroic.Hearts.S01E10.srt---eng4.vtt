[The Blood of Youth: Quest of Heroic Hearts]

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.980
[Episode 10]

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.400
Greetings, Sect Leader.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.520
The side effects

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.470
of your demonic arts are getting worse lately.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.470
We must find the Skysplitter

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.470
to treat you quickly.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.080
But

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.000
why must we use them

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.030
to find the Skysplitter?

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.520
They will be a nuisance.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.840
Why don't I

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.560
just kill them?

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.400
They must not be killed.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:45.910
That's my bottom line.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.030
I told you

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.800
that Weigui and the Skysplitter were related.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.190
Giving them the fragments

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.030
is to help Weigui recall his memory.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:57.520
Only he

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.120
can lead us to the real Skysplitter.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.800
Also,

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:07.680
you're not to act

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.470
without my permission.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.240
But...

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.710
Yes.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.900
Due to the side effects of the demonic arts,

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.710
my gender changes irregularly,

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.080
and it's happening more frequently lately.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.560
It seems like

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.150
my time is running out.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.000
Where is Ye Zhixin?

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.150
He went to the toilet, I suppose.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.220
[I have left. I will wait for you in the corridor. Ye Zhixin]

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.280
Why did he go to the corridor alone?

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.310
I guess

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.040
he wants to get the Skysplitter fragment

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.720
before the break of dawn.

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:21.560
Perhaps

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.120
he wants to be the strongest swordsman too?

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.800
Weigui,

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.270
do you know where the corridor is?

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.680
I remember roughly what it looks like.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.240
I already told you everything yesterday.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.000
The corridor is a place.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.750
Its location is written in this book.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.120
Let's go then.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.430
Let's go.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.420
Let's go.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.270
We've been walking for several hours.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.750
How come we are not there yet?

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.750
Miss Xiaohua,

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.600
are we heading in the right direction?

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.270
The book says it's just right in front.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.240
[The Corridor]

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.870
See?

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.190
This is the corridor.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:14.750
The door is ajar.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.120
Someone must have been here.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:17.600
Ye Zhixin?

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.270
Not necessarily.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.950
It could be other people from the martial arts world.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.750
It could also be people from Tianwaitian.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.430
What are we waiting for?

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:28.430
We should go inside.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.120
I think this is the corridor.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.720
After being tormented many times by the ox-head butcher

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.600
in the dream we had at Liuli Manor,

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.270
I feel unnerved

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:50.950
when I see the mist.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.310
We are not familiar with the place.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.920
Please

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.950
exercise caution.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.750
Miss I-know-everything,

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.040
is there a creepy legend about this place?

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.430
Just speak frankly.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.800
We can take it.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.190
Legend has it

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.390
that this is a dangerous place.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.000
They say

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.160
whoever enters the corridor

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.510
and comes out alive will have an unsound mind.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.630
When we enter,

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:27.870
we must look after each other.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.720
Don't get separated.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:37.750
What are you writing?

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.870
What you owe me.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.310
I don't have time to count everything now.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.560
But in the future, I'll itemize everything clearly.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.430
You'll have to pay for each of my services.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:51.160
You!

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.160
A merchant only cares about their money.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.480
Merchant?

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.510
Services ought to be compensated.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.270
Why does it turn dark suddenly?

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.950
This is eerie.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:21.040
This place

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.390
is just as creepy as the dream in Liuli Manor.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:24.680
What do you think?

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:29.600
Hua Xiaohua?

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:31.750
Weigui?

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:35.870
I can hear you.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:37.720
Where are you?

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:39.720
I can't see you at all.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:41.830
I'm at the center of the corridor.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:47.870
Me too.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.190
Me too.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.120
Don't worry.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.630
There is only one path.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.270
Just walk straight

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.430
and we will group up.

00:07:58.510 --> 00:07:59.430
Be careful.

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:00.240
- Okay. - Okay.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.870
Why is the mist getting thicker?

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.830
Lei Lingze. Xiaohua.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:57.510
Who are you?

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:01.320
You don't remember me.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.240
I don't.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.030
Who's there?

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.790
[One can be smart or ignorant, one article can be profound or shallow]

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.960
[An ignorant person can become smart with enough practice]

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:45.790
Isn't this

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:48.870
the information I recorded?

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:51.390
You're just a writer of tabloid press.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.630
What makes you think you can be part

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.080
of the martial arts world or the Baixiao Hall?

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.150
You overestimated yourself.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.510
Go back to where you come from.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:07.270
No one will ever read the gibberish you wrote.

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:09.320
You shouldn't even live in this world.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.270
Shut up.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:11.630
This is not true.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.120
This is not true!

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:36.840
Who are you?

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:38.440
I can ask you the same question.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.150
Who are you?

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.390
I am Lei Lingze.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:56.910
No,

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.550
you're not.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:00.790
I am Lei Lingze.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:03.550
Impossible.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.200
It's futile.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:12.960
You can't unsheathe it.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.000
Curse it!

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.030
Don't you want to be the strongest swordsman?

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:22.150
Come.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.670
Let me show you how to unsheathe a sword.

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.120
I want to be the strongest swordsman.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:28.360
Come here.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.200
Useless.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.670
You can't even unsheathe your sword.

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:44.840
How can you kill?

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:46.390
How can you be the strongest swordsman?

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.270
It seems like you're dying to know who I am.

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:57.320
Is that so?

00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:58.240
Although

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:00.030
I don't know who you are,

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:02.670
I know

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.600
that I must kill you.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.750
Perhaps you shouldn't have known about it.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:15.790
Curse it.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.390
Why can't I move?

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:31.720
What do you think?

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:33.840
I prepared this for you.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.960
Do you like it?

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:39.670
If you can't overcome your past fear,

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.000
you will not be able to move.
