WEBVTT

00:00:48.903 --> 00:00:49.904
{\an8}Arrest me.

00:00:51.948 --> 00:00:52.782
{\an8}I am

00:00:53.616 --> 00:00:54.534
{\an8}Gil-dong.

00:01:00.623 --> 00:01:01.958
{\an8}Do you expect me to believe that?

00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:03.751
{\an8}Of course you shouldn't.

00:01:04.294 --> 00:01:05.920
{\an8}You'd better believe me.

00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:07.672
{\an8}- The witnesses are--
- What are you doing?

00:01:09.424 --> 00:01:10.425
{\an8}I'm making a confession.

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:12.677
{\an8}Write this down.

00:01:14.512 --> 00:01:15.763
{\an8}Stop. Let's go outside.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.725
{\an8}I'm here to stop this.

00:01:20.185 --> 00:01:22.437
{\an8}I want this to stop now.

00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:27.859
Officer Seo.

00:01:32.155 --> 00:01:33.865
Your Highness, please come with me.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.491
What are you going to do?

00:01:35.575 --> 00:01:37.368
I will confess until he believes it

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.580
because he says he can't believe me.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.461
You trust me, right?

00:01:56.596 --> 00:01:57.847
I apologize.

00:01:57.931 --> 00:01:59.807
She wanted to make sure you're protected.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.690
The ones who received
the grains and herbs Gil-dong stole

00:02:07.774 --> 00:02:09.108
were patients at the Hyeminseo.

00:02:09.692 --> 00:02:10.568
Stop messing with me.

00:02:12.695 --> 00:02:14.656
You're the one messing with us.

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.451
You know the Grand Prince isn't Gil-dong,
yet you still pinned it on him.

00:02:22.705 --> 00:02:23.957
Listen.

00:02:25.333 --> 00:02:27.001
I was the one who leaked the ledger,

00:02:27.585 --> 00:02:29.629
I was the one who threatened your brother,

00:02:30.296 --> 00:02:32.090
and I was the one who shot the arrow

00:02:32.173 --> 00:02:34.300
at the king the night the courtesans fled.

00:02:35.677 --> 00:02:36.678
It was all me.

00:02:41.182 --> 00:02:43.268
And through it all,

00:02:44.602 --> 00:02:46.062
the Grand Prince stayed by my side.

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:49.107
From now on, stay within my expectations.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.276
Just stay within what I can handle.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.114
He embraced Gil-dong's theft.

00:02:56.948 --> 00:02:58.992
And with the ledger from Gil-dong…

00:02:59.075 --> 00:03:01.411
By the law of the realm,
I sentence you to exile.

00:03:01.494 --> 00:03:03.454
…he punished a corrupt official.

00:03:04.831 --> 00:03:06.416
He also stepped in for Gil-dong…

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:07.375
FILL YOUR GRANARY

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.919
…and helped those at the leper camp.

00:03:12.797 --> 00:03:14.424
That's the kind of man he is.

00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:22.265
A man who would

00:03:22.348 --> 00:03:24.392
readily jump into the fire.

00:03:25.143 --> 00:03:26.227
That's him.

00:03:29.105 --> 00:03:30.648
All that, just to protect one thing.

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.862
Just to protect one thing.

00:03:48.458 --> 00:03:50.835
Do you think Im Jae-i
will really arrest Hong-si?

00:03:52.587 --> 00:03:54.339
No, he can't.

00:03:58.885 --> 00:04:01.596
I don't care who the real Gil-dong is.

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:03.931
I know which Gil-dong I will arrest.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.101
So you believe me.

00:04:10.104 --> 00:04:12.857
Gil-dong must be someone dear to you.

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:15.234
Gil-dong

00:04:15.318 --> 00:04:18.488
is the very name
I'm fighting with my life to protect.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.330
Tie me up.

00:04:30.333 --> 00:04:31.626
You can't, can you?

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.920
Because of what's in your heart.

00:04:38.883 --> 00:04:41.094
Yes, that's holding me back now.

00:04:41.844 --> 00:04:42.929
That I…

00:04:45.431 --> 00:04:47.892
I'm not talking about
your feelings for me.

00:04:49.018 --> 00:04:51.562
I'm talking about
what's truly in your heart.

00:04:53.022 --> 00:04:54.148
What?

00:04:54.232 --> 00:04:56.442
You don't want to arrest Gil-dong,

00:04:57.527 --> 00:04:58.945
whether it's me or not.

00:05:04.575 --> 00:05:06.994
The people who needed Gil-dong's help…

00:05:14.001 --> 00:05:15.253
I will not forget your mercy.

00:05:16.045 --> 00:05:18.131
Deep down,

00:05:18.214 --> 00:05:19.966
you also have compassion for them.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.135
Just like the Grand Prince does.

00:05:28.724 --> 00:05:30.351
I wish you would just use me.

00:05:31.686 --> 00:05:35.148
I wish you were cruel enough
to use my feelings against me!

00:05:40.236 --> 00:05:41.070
You…

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.490
I thought you were here
as the Grand Prince's shield.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:47.827
But you're a sword.

00:05:49.704 --> 00:05:51.289
And it cuts deep.

00:06:01.507 --> 00:06:03.718
Thanks, Lady Hae-rim.
You're always so kind to us.

00:06:04.802 --> 00:06:06.762
I told you.
I'm coming here because I want to.

00:06:08.556 --> 00:06:12.059
Any news on No-eul yet?

00:06:12.143 --> 00:06:15.062
I hear Dae-chu, the guard,
has been looking hard for her.

00:06:16.731 --> 00:06:17.565
Forget what I said.

00:06:17.648 --> 00:06:19.400
Come on, have some.

00:06:19.984 --> 00:06:21.152
You're here.

00:06:23.362 --> 00:06:24.655
Where's Physician Hong?

00:06:25.323 --> 00:06:27.533
Eun-jo couldn't come.

00:06:27.617 --> 00:06:29.118
Has she been arrested?

00:06:30.036 --> 00:06:31.120
What?

00:06:33.206 --> 00:06:34.207
Gil-dong?

00:06:35.291 --> 00:06:36.959
Is that the sketch of Gil-dong?

00:06:38.586 --> 00:06:40.379
Well…

00:06:45.927 --> 00:06:46.969
I remember

00:06:47.845 --> 00:06:51.599
hearing a rumor that
Gil-dong brought rice to the leper camp.

00:06:52.183 --> 00:06:53.184
Is that true?

00:06:55.144 --> 00:06:57.313
{\an8}ROYAL ORDER

00:07:01.192 --> 00:07:04.111
Why did you ask if Eun-jo was arrested?

00:07:05.446 --> 00:07:06.989
It was just…

00:07:07.073 --> 00:07:10.076
a slip of the tongue.

00:07:10.952 --> 00:07:11.953
I don't think so.

00:07:12.745 --> 00:07:15.331
I think we're thinking the same thing.

00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:18.000
And if I'm right,

00:07:18.084 --> 00:07:20.545
you're trying to protect Eun-jo,
just like I am.

00:07:24.006 --> 00:07:25.091
Come on.

00:07:26.717 --> 00:07:27.885
Well…

00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:29.720
The thing is…

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.681
I saw something.

00:07:31.764 --> 00:07:33.849
The night the courtesans fled,

00:07:33.933 --> 00:07:36.644
I saw the nine-cheok-tall man
shoot the arrow at the king.

00:07:36.727 --> 00:07:38.271
It was the Grand Prince.

00:07:42.441 --> 00:07:45.111
If it was that night, it must be Eun-jo.

00:07:45.653 --> 00:07:46.988
Pardon?

00:07:47.071 --> 00:07:49.532
Then it is Gil-dong.

00:07:50.533 --> 00:07:51.993
Since when?

00:07:53.744 --> 00:07:57.915
Nobody in this capital
cares about the leper camp.

00:07:57.999 --> 00:08:00.209
Physician Hong is the only one
who knows about us,

00:08:00.293 --> 00:08:03.629
and Gil-dong is the only one
who's always there for us.

00:08:03.713 --> 00:08:05.548
I have to pretend that I don't know.

00:08:14.223 --> 00:08:16.058
I don't have time to be in shock.

00:08:16.142 --> 00:08:17.560
I'll go see Eun-jo.

00:08:21.188 --> 00:08:23.649
Your Highness, the sketches
of Gil-dong are being taken down.

00:08:23.733 --> 00:08:25.651
It seems the investigation
has been called off.

00:08:27.945 --> 00:08:31.073
Is there a reason
why Im Jae-i changed his mind?

00:08:31.949 --> 00:08:33.159
Yes, there is.

00:08:33.784 --> 00:08:35.036
It's behind you.

00:08:35.661 --> 00:08:36.787
Behind me?

00:08:38.623 --> 00:08:39.749
Oh, dear!

00:08:39.832 --> 00:08:41.208
When did you get here?

00:08:42.668 --> 00:08:43.586
Just now.

00:08:45.504 --> 00:08:47.465
You must be here because of Gil-dong.

00:08:47.548 --> 00:08:48.674
Don't worry.

00:08:49.425 --> 00:08:50.635
It's all taken care of.

00:08:51.844 --> 00:08:53.095
That's fortunate.

00:08:53.804 --> 00:08:55.056
Or unfortunate.

00:09:01.729 --> 00:09:05.358
His Highness and Physician Hong
must have had a fight.

00:09:05.441 --> 00:09:07.151
That's how it seems, right?

00:09:07.943 --> 00:09:10.112
That's how it seems to you?

00:09:15.117 --> 00:09:16.410
I didn't trust you.

00:09:17.078 --> 00:09:18.496
I trusted Im Jae-i.

00:09:21.165 --> 00:09:24.585
No man would drive
the woman he cares for toward death.

00:09:29.715 --> 00:09:30.716
Promise me.

00:09:31.509 --> 00:09:35.179
If something like this happens again,
don't step forward.

00:09:40.935 --> 00:09:43.270
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:09:49.735 --> 00:09:51.445
I'm here.

00:09:51.529 --> 00:09:52.363
Right here.

00:09:56.784 --> 00:09:57.910
I'm smiling here.

00:10:04.041 --> 00:10:06.669
Let's not worry about
what hasn't happened yet.

00:10:13.008 --> 00:10:15.594
We'll take a breather today

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:18.055
so we can start again tomorrow.

00:10:21.434 --> 00:10:23.394
Can we do that? Just for today.

00:10:24.645 --> 00:10:27.231
It's been a long night.

00:10:46.083 --> 00:10:47.084
Eun-jo!

00:10:48.043 --> 00:10:49.295
Lady Hae-rim.

00:10:51.714 --> 00:10:53.090
Is everything all right?

00:10:53.841 --> 00:10:55.009
Yes.

00:10:55.092 --> 00:10:57.094
Did anyone follow you?

00:10:57.178 --> 00:10:58.971
- Who?
- Well…

00:11:00.639 --> 00:11:03.684
I hear there's a madman
roaming around at night these days.

00:11:03.768 --> 00:11:05.811
Really? I haven't seen anyone like that.

00:11:05.895 --> 00:11:07.146
Of course you haven't.

00:11:07.813 --> 00:11:08.939
- What?
- What?

00:11:09.023 --> 00:11:10.107
I mean,

00:11:10.191 --> 00:11:11.650
you shouldn't see them.

00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:16.655
Did you come here alone at this hour,
without Kkot-sim?

00:11:17.281 --> 00:11:20.367
I slipped out for a walk
and thought I'd stop by.

00:11:20.451 --> 00:11:22.161
I just wanted to see your face. Go in.

00:11:22.953 --> 00:11:24.788
It's late. Let me walk you home.

00:11:24.872 --> 00:11:25.789
No, don't.

00:11:25.873 --> 00:11:27.875
I know you're busy. Go get some rest.

00:11:28.709 --> 00:11:31.295
But that wouldn't be proper.

00:11:31.378 --> 00:11:34.590
You have greater things to do.
Don't worry about such trifles.

00:11:35.341 --> 00:11:36.342
Greater things?

00:11:36.967 --> 00:11:38.844
I mean, it's tough
to work at the Hyeminseo.

00:11:38.928 --> 00:11:40.095
Come on.

00:11:41.931 --> 00:11:43.641
Please return home safely.

00:11:44.308 --> 00:11:45.392
I will, Eun-jo.

00:12:08.249 --> 00:12:09.583
His Highness is waiting inside.

00:12:10.668 --> 00:12:13.170
Don't do something like this ever again.

00:12:13.837 --> 00:12:16.215
If this happens again, I swear,

00:12:16.298 --> 00:12:17.883
you'll have to face my blade.

00:12:20.928 --> 00:12:23.973
It looks like a lot of you wish
to serve as the Grand Prince's sword.

00:12:25.349 --> 00:12:26.559
He's got two already.

00:12:29.478 --> 00:12:30.312
Two?

00:12:30.396 --> 00:12:32.898
What do you mean?
I'm the only guard he has.

00:12:35.401 --> 00:12:37.152
Who's the other sword?

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.038
It must be nice,
drinking at a time like this.

00:12:49.415 --> 00:12:50.916
Someone told me that

00:12:51.917 --> 00:12:54.044
I should take a breather tonight.

00:12:56.672 --> 00:12:58.215
Besides, you took a step back.

00:13:07.182 --> 00:13:08.809
I didn't ask you to sit with me.

00:13:10.102 --> 00:13:11.478
I'm not drinking with you.

00:13:16.734 --> 00:13:17.568
Agreed.

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.246
How could a woman…

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:30.914
Exactly.

00:13:33.584 --> 00:13:34.418
If I were you,

00:13:34.501 --> 00:13:37.254
I would've stopped her at all costs,
even if I had to break her legs.

00:13:38.172 --> 00:13:39.006
As if she'd listen.

00:13:44.762 --> 00:13:46.055
So stubborn.

00:13:46.639 --> 00:13:48.557
- So headstrong.
- So arrogant.

00:13:48.641 --> 00:13:49.808
So bullheaded.

00:13:57.441 --> 00:13:58.651
I have a question.

00:13:58.734 --> 00:14:00.027
I won't answer your question.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:03.489
The archer who shot at His Majesty
the night the courtesans fled…

00:14:03.572 --> 00:14:06.075
Given the distance and the accuracy,
it has to be Hong Eun-jo.

00:14:06.158 --> 00:14:08.869
But all the soldiers said
the archer was nine cheok tall.

00:14:10.663 --> 00:14:12.373
So maybe it was me, like you said.

00:14:12.456 --> 00:14:15.542
I know your archery isn't at that level.

00:14:16.752 --> 00:14:19.046
You do? And you set me up as Gil-dong?

00:14:20.839 --> 00:14:23.968
Sometimes, the wind works in your favor
and you hit the mark by accident.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.844
"By accident?"

00:14:34.019 --> 00:14:35.270
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

00:14:36.522 --> 00:14:39.108
I even believe that Gil-dong is woman.

00:14:40.734 --> 00:14:42.695
There's nothing I can't believe now.

00:14:42.778 --> 00:14:45.155
Our souls were switched.

00:14:55.457 --> 00:14:56.542
I told you.

00:15:00.129 --> 00:15:03.507
I'll report that suspecting Gil-dong
as the assassin was my mistake.

00:15:06.677 --> 00:15:10.055
I will be too drunk to remember
everything that happened tonight.

00:15:11.348 --> 00:15:12.474
You should forget it too.

00:15:12.558 --> 00:15:13.475
Especially…

00:15:14.226 --> 00:15:15.394
what the lady did.

00:15:17.187 --> 00:15:18.188
I will.

00:15:29.783 --> 00:15:31.618
- Burn them all.
- Yes, sir!

00:15:32.661 --> 00:15:34.496
That idiot Jae-i is being fickle again.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:35.873
What a selfish brat.

00:15:38.917 --> 00:15:40.502
What is it?

00:15:40.586 --> 00:15:41.712
It's…

00:15:51.221 --> 00:15:53.640
{\an8}EUIJU, PYEONGAN PROVINCE

00:16:04.276 --> 00:16:06.653
"I heard of Lord Im Sa-hyeong's
eldest son's passing."

00:16:06.737 --> 00:16:08.155
"Please convey my condolences."

00:16:09.907 --> 00:16:11.200
I will.

00:16:11.825 --> 00:16:12.701
Where are the goods?

00:16:21.126 --> 00:16:23.629
"Who hurt that pretty face of yours?"

00:16:23.712 --> 00:16:25.130
is what he said.

00:16:30.177 --> 00:16:31.303
That's none of his business.

00:16:32.638 --> 00:16:34.348
Tell him to bring the goods already.

00:16:37.059 --> 00:16:39.061
The decoction doesn't work at all.

00:16:59.498 --> 00:17:00.707
A tiger.

00:17:23.272 --> 00:17:25.399
What you're seeing
is because of withdrawal.

00:17:25.482 --> 00:17:26.859
Please don't let it fool you.

00:17:26.942 --> 00:17:30.529
Do you really not hear that roar?

00:17:36.869 --> 00:17:39.329
Fight all the things you see.

00:17:40.372 --> 00:17:42.791
Until Geum-nok brings the incense,

00:17:43.709 --> 00:17:45.627
no one must know of this.

00:17:52.634 --> 00:17:53.969
Is everything loaded? Let's go.

00:17:54.052 --> 00:17:56.138
Your Highness,
Gaizhou has been overrun by bandits.

00:17:56.847 --> 00:17:57.973
We must take a detour.

00:18:00.559 --> 00:18:02.311
Any delay would drive him mad.

00:18:04.146 --> 00:18:05.731
How long will it take?

00:18:05.814 --> 00:18:08.734
I'm sure Lady Jang
went to Euiju for a reason.

00:18:10.152 --> 00:18:12.779
Her decision to travel alone
was rather sudden, indeed.

00:18:12.863 --> 00:18:15.407
Something unexpected
must have forced her to.

00:18:16.116 --> 00:18:17.576
Something unexpected…

00:18:19.703 --> 00:18:21.246
Is that Im Seung-jae's death?

00:18:23.332 --> 00:18:24.708
According to our findings,

00:18:24.791 --> 00:18:26.293
Im Seung-jae was

00:18:26.376 --> 00:18:29.588
regularly meeting
with Ming merchants in Euiju.

00:18:30.297 --> 00:18:31.632
So Lady Jang

00:18:31.715 --> 00:18:34.509
went to trade on Im Seung-jae's behalf.

00:18:35.135 --> 00:18:36.470
So

00:18:36.929 --> 00:18:38.847
I will discreetly send someone
to watch her.

00:18:38.931 --> 00:18:40.682
I will go.

00:18:41.642 --> 00:18:43.227
If they're really trading secrets,

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:46.355
it won't be easy to get
the Ming merchants to talk.

00:18:47.272 --> 00:18:49.983
Because their client
is the Left State Councilor of Joseon.

00:18:51.944 --> 00:18:54.404
The only person
who can press them for answers

00:18:54.488 --> 00:18:56.073
is me, the one of royal blood.

00:18:57.074 --> 00:18:59.076
Are you leaving right now?

00:18:59.159 --> 00:19:00.327
Yes.

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:02.079
Dae-chu will be out shortly with the bags.

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.249
You'll be gone for a while.

00:19:05.332 --> 00:19:07.084
Won't Lord Im Sa-hyeong
find it suspicious?

00:19:07.834 --> 00:19:10.045
He thinks I'm going to my villa
in Hamgyeong to recover.

00:19:11.672 --> 00:19:14.174
I made a bit of a fuss
about the stab wound on my back.

00:19:15.509 --> 00:19:18.095
This excuse should keep Im Sa-hyeong
from suspecting anything.

00:19:20.013 --> 00:19:20.889
Your Highness.

00:19:23.433 --> 00:19:24.851
Let's go. The boat is leaving soon.

00:19:24.935 --> 00:19:26.019
Give me one moment.

00:19:30.065 --> 00:19:33.193
If anything happens while I'm away,
stay low.

00:19:33.277 --> 00:19:34.403
Don't be reckless again.

00:19:35.821 --> 00:19:37.281
I'll play the coward.

00:19:37.364 --> 00:19:38.657
Be as cowardly as you can.

00:19:39.992 --> 00:19:41.743
Your Highness, we must hurry.

00:19:42.577 --> 00:19:43.412
I'll go.

00:19:50.168 --> 00:19:51.211
Your Highness,

00:19:52.087 --> 00:19:53.255
you take care as well.

00:20:03.765 --> 00:20:05.892
Young Master, what are you doing?

00:20:07.811 --> 00:20:09.062
Leave it. I'll do it.

00:20:09.146 --> 00:20:10.105
Don't touch it.

00:20:10.188 --> 00:20:12.149
I'm training right now.

00:20:12.733 --> 00:20:13.859
Training?

00:20:14.484 --> 00:20:17.612
Doing laundry
is great training for concentration.

00:20:17.696 --> 00:20:21.199
It washes away
all the frustration from my studies.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.911
Be gentle.

00:20:26.371 --> 00:20:29.499
Why are you looking all crumpled,
like damp laundry?

00:20:31.251 --> 00:20:32.502
What's the matter?

00:20:34.838 --> 00:20:35.922
Do you remember

00:20:36.006 --> 00:20:38.425
when you lived in Euiju as a child?

00:20:39.051 --> 00:20:40.927
When Father was
the Chief Magistrate there?

00:20:41.636 --> 00:20:44.306
Right. You wouldn't remember.
You were just a baby.

00:20:44.389 --> 00:20:45.599
Yes, I only heard about it.

00:20:46.183 --> 00:20:48.810
Don't even get me started.

00:20:48.894 --> 00:20:52.230
Even in summer,
Euiju got really cold at night.

00:20:54.524 --> 00:20:55.817
Really?

00:20:56.985 --> 00:20:59.905
My ears were freezing,
and my nose was freezing.

00:21:00.697 --> 00:21:01.698
You see,

00:21:01.782 --> 00:21:03.700
I was born in summer,
in the Year of the Monkey.

00:21:03.784 --> 00:21:04.993
I hate winter…

00:21:06.286 --> 00:21:08.246
What? Where did she go?

00:21:15.045 --> 00:21:16.755
Your Highness, let's go inside.

00:21:26.139 --> 00:21:27.557
Isn't that Hong-si?

00:21:31.353 --> 00:21:32.604
Hong Eun-jo!

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.195
Excuse me.

00:21:40.278 --> 00:21:42.614
Could I borrow this for a moment?

00:21:45.158 --> 00:21:47.452
What do you think
she's doing with the arrow?

00:21:48.453 --> 00:21:51.540
Arrows are meant to be shot, nothing else.

00:21:52.249 --> 00:21:53.166
Right?

00:21:55.877 --> 00:21:58.004
Where do you think she'll shoot it?

00:21:58.088 --> 00:21:59.089
I wonder.

00:22:02.467 --> 00:22:04.010
How strange.

00:22:04.094 --> 00:22:05.887
Why does it look like she's aiming at you?

00:22:05.971 --> 00:22:07.180
How strange.

00:22:07.722 --> 00:22:08.932
It looks like that to you too?

00:22:10.475 --> 00:22:12.436
Take a step back!

00:22:18.358 --> 00:22:19.401
Hit!

00:22:19.484 --> 00:22:20.569
You took two steps back?

00:22:22.988 --> 00:22:24.990
I guess I took two steps back.

00:22:29.244 --> 00:22:30.412
What is it?

00:22:33.665 --> 00:22:34.958
Are they earmuffs?

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:38.962
I hear nights in Euiju are cold!

00:22:39.838 --> 00:22:41.673
Have a safe trip!

00:22:44.759 --> 00:22:47.554
I didn't get to say a proper goodbye.

00:22:51.057 --> 00:22:52.434
I'll be back soon!

00:23:08.283 --> 00:23:10.869
You look like you're leaving for good.

00:23:10.952 --> 00:23:11.995
It's just two weeks.

00:23:12.078 --> 00:23:13.413
- Ten days.
- What?

00:23:13.496 --> 00:23:15.457
Two weeks will feel like forever.

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:16.708
Let's make it ten days.

00:23:16.791 --> 00:23:20.295
Come on.
You'll make yourself sick if you rush.

00:23:20.378 --> 00:23:21.588
I must make myself sick.

00:23:21.671 --> 00:23:23.840
So I can go straight to the Hyeminseo.

00:23:23.924 --> 00:23:27.010
Unbelievable! I don't want to go
to Euiju as a third wheel.

00:23:27.969 --> 00:23:29.137
She prepared yours too.

00:23:31.598 --> 00:23:33.850
I knew from the start
Hong-si had a kind heart.

00:23:33.934 --> 00:23:34.935
"Heart?"

00:23:35.518 --> 00:23:37.229
- Give it. It's mind.
- Your Highness!

00:23:37.312 --> 00:23:38.480
- Give it!
- Don't be like this.

00:23:38.563 --> 00:23:40.482
- Come again.
- I wish you all the best.

00:23:40.565 --> 00:23:41.691
Thanks.

00:23:51.117 --> 00:23:52.953
Oh, dear! You scared me.

00:23:54.454 --> 00:23:55.455
Are you here to eat?

00:23:57.499 --> 00:24:00.293
Could I have some rice that's gone bad?

00:24:01.002 --> 00:24:02.295
I haven't eaten for three days.

00:24:03.463 --> 00:24:05.465
What happened, young lady?

00:24:08.218 --> 00:24:09.761
Is your name No-eul, by any chance?

00:24:11.763 --> 00:24:14.015
Why do you ask?

00:24:14.099 --> 00:24:15.684
This man called Dae-chu or whatever

00:24:15.767 --> 00:24:18.561
asked me to let him know
if I see a woman with a Hamgyeong accent.

00:24:27.612 --> 00:24:29.823
Dae-chu?

00:24:29.906 --> 00:24:31.533
Who on earth is that?

00:24:48.758 --> 00:24:50.510
Where's the runaway Seolokgwan courtesan?

00:24:50.593 --> 00:24:52.846
We've closed all the gates
to search the capital.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:56.433
Lord Left State Councilor,
I have something to report.

00:25:12.032 --> 00:25:13.700
Who is at your residence again?

00:25:13.783 --> 00:25:16.077
She refuses my brother,
or any other physicians.

00:25:16.161 --> 00:25:17.454
She says it has to be you.

00:25:22.751 --> 00:25:25.587
She said no one must know,
so I hid her here.

00:25:43.897 --> 00:25:45.690
She is frail and weak.

00:25:45.774 --> 00:25:48.526
But her condition is stabilizing.

00:25:50.904 --> 00:25:53.490
I'm glad she made it back safely.

00:25:58.286 --> 00:25:59.996
It's already light outside.

00:26:01.915 --> 00:26:04.042
Don't worry about us, you go ahead.

00:26:04.125 --> 00:26:05.460
You need to go to the Hyeminseo.

00:26:06.127 --> 00:26:09.422
When No-eul wakes up,
I'll take her to the leper camp.

00:26:12.342 --> 00:26:13.843
Could you do that for me?

00:26:19.057 --> 00:26:21.142
- Search every corner!
- Yes, sir!

00:26:23.103 --> 00:26:24.479
What are you doing?

00:26:24.562 --> 00:26:26.398
What is it? What's all this about?

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:32.987
What is it this time?

00:26:33.655 --> 00:26:35.365
They're looking for Gil-dong.

00:26:35.448 --> 00:26:37.325
- Gil-dong?
- Yes.

00:26:46.126 --> 00:26:47.585
Please stop the investigation.

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:51.548
It's been put on hold
because there wasn't enough evidence.

00:26:51.631 --> 00:26:52.590
The Grand Prince

00:26:52.674 --> 00:26:55.844
once made a deal with me
to cover up Gil-dong's case.

00:26:56.845 --> 00:26:57.846
That means

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.348
he's protecting Gil-dong.

00:27:00.432 --> 00:27:03.351
As far as I know,
that deal works against you as well.

00:27:04.227 --> 00:27:05.437
Once I find more evidence--

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.981
You already found the evidence.

00:27:09.858 --> 00:27:10.859
Gil-dong.

00:27:13.278 --> 00:27:14.696
We just need to catch Gil-dong,

00:27:14.779 --> 00:27:17.907
get him to say Grand Prince Dowol's name.

00:27:21.619 --> 00:27:23.705
We found a perfect remedy

00:27:23.788 --> 00:27:25.790
for His Majesty's troubled mind.

00:27:30.503 --> 00:27:32.130
Well done.

00:27:47.312 --> 00:27:48.438
Seok-sam!

00:27:48.938 --> 00:27:50.148
Eun-jo.

00:27:50.231 --> 00:27:52.233
Could you give us a moment? I know him.

00:27:53.359 --> 00:27:55.570
He's a traitor. Make it quick.

00:27:55.653 --> 00:27:57.113
Traitor?

00:27:57.697 --> 00:27:58.698
For dong what?

00:27:58.781 --> 00:28:00.700
He harbored Gil-dong, the assassin.

00:28:06.664 --> 00:28:09.959
They're restarting the investigation
into Gil-dong.

00:28:10.043 --> 00:28:12.629
Don't worry about me,
and go find Lady Dong-ju.

00:28:12.712 --> 00:28:14.005
All right.

00:28:14.088 --> 00:28:15.131
Please wait for me.

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.050
Eun-jo.

00:28:17.133 --> 00:28:19.636
If something bad happens to us,

00:28:19.719 --> 00:28:21.804
you have nothing to do with it.

00:28:22.514 --> 00:28:24.015
Thanks for everything.

00:28:24.098 --> 00:28:25.683
Now go!

00:28:25.767 --> 00:28:26.976
Go!

00:28:31.397 --> 00:28:32.440
Seok-sam.

00:28:46.871 --> 00:28:47.914
Kids!

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:50.250
Are you all right?

00:28:51.125 --> 00:28:52.418
Where's Lady Dong-ju?

00:28:53.044 --> 00:28:54.921
"When you wake up in the morning,

00:28:55.004 --> 00:28:56.923
get the kids to wash their faces first."

00:28:57.006 --> 00:28:59.801
"Go to Cho-rong's
and get something to eat."

00:29:00.593 --> 00:29:03.763
"Ask Gae-ddong's mom to nurse the baby."

00:29:03.847 --> 00:29:05.348
"And Eun-jo,

00:29:07.016 --> 00:29:08.393
I'm fine."

00:29:10.603 --> 00:29:13.523
She said this before she got arrested.

00:29:16.442 --> 00:29:17.694
Lady Dong-ju.

00:29:18.194 --> 00:29:19.779
Lady Dong-ju…

00:29:27.287 --> 00:29:28.580
How curious.

00:29:29.581 --> 00:29:31.541
You wouldn't even cry.

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:34.252
I'm worried that,

00:29:35.253 --> 00:29:37.380
if my cries carry beyond the palace walls,

00:29:38.298 --> 00:29:41.968
it will hurt Gil-dong's heart.

00:29:46.139 --> 00:29:48.349
What a kind heart you have.

00:29:52.145 --> 00:29:53.313
Listen.

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.316
If this wench doesn't cry,

00:29:56.399 --> 00:29:59.277
I will kill you two,
the ones who twisted her legs.

00:29:59.861 --> 00:30:01.529
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

00:30:05.366 --> 00:30:06.659
Please let me enter the palace.

00:30:06.743 --> 00:30:08.620
When His Highness is back--

00:30:08.703 --> 00:30:09.829
It'll be too late then.

00:30:09.913 --> 00:30:12.373
- I must go.
- Calm down.

00:30:12.457 --> 00:30:14.292
- Even if you step up--
- It's me!

00:30:18.046 --> 00:30:19.047
Aide Kang.

00:30:20.757 --> 00:30:22.175
It's me.

00:30:24.844 --> 00:30:25.887
What do you mean?

00:30:29.724 --> 00:30:31.517
Did you just say Gil-dong?

00:30:31.601 --> 00:30:32.810
Yes.

00:30:32.894 --> 00:30:34.145
This is a grave matter.

00:30:34.228 --> 00:30:35.355
Why Gil-dong, of all people…

00:30:35.438 --> 00:30:38.024
The king's madness is worse
than in the Gyeongo Year.

00:30:38.566 --> 00:30:41.861
He's rounding up everyone
who has spoken of Gil-dong.

00:30:42.487 --> 00:30:45.156
Sir, I didn't do anything. I'm innocent!

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:51.412
My baby!

00:30:52.121 --> 00:30:53.414
Sir!

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:56.125
Getting help from Gil-dong is a crime?

00:30:56.209 --> 00:30:58.378
They wouldn't have done this
if he had helped animals!

00:30:59.003 --> 00:31:02.048
To the king, we're nothing but bugs.

00:31:15.603 --> 00:31:17.689
I feel much lighter.

00:31:17.772 --> 00:31:19.816
Allow me to escort you to your bedchamber.

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:27.949
Your Majesty.

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:31.327
I've been handling the investigation,
so I know the truth.

00:31:31.411 --> 00:31:32.912
They don't know who Gil-dong is.

00:31:32.996 --> 00:31:34.455
Know your place.

00:31:41.587 --> 00:31:42.547
I know.

00:31:45.883 --> 00:31:47.093
Then why…

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.847
I'm sure Gil-dong knows them.

00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:54.892
When curfew falls,

00:31:54.976 --> 00:31:57.353
hang the wench's head
above the palace gate.

00:31:59.772 --> 00:32:01.482
We will hang one person each day.

00:32:02.358 --> 00:32:04.736
Ten days or a hundred…
I don't care how long it takes.

00:32:04.819 --> 00:32:06.779
We will continue until Gil-dong appears.

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:13.870
Right.

00:32:16.622 --> 00:32:19.125
We probably don't have
enough heads to last 100 days.

00:32:19.876 --> 00:32:22.003
Once all the Chief Censor's slaves
are hanged,

00:32:22.086 --> 00:32:23.212
then…

00:32:25.423 --> 00:32:27.425
hang those at the leper camp next.

00:32:40.688 --> 00:32:41.856
Eun-jo.

00:32:41.939 --> 00:32:43.983
I packed the bag as you said.

00:32:44.067 --> 00:32:45.443
Good. You should head out now.

00:32:45.526 --> 00:32:48.404
Why are you telling us
to go to our cousin's in Gyeongsang?

00:32:48.488 --> 00:32:49.781
Did you get into trouble?

00:32:51.866 --> 00:32:53.618
Please don't ask me anything, just go.

00:32:54.368 --> 00:32:56.829
You idiot.
If you're in trouble, you should run.

00:32:56.913 --> 00:32:58.164
Come on. Pack your bags too.

00:33:02.418 --> 00:33:03.711
I'll follow you soon.

00:33:08.591 --> 00:33:09.550
What is it?

00:33:09.634 --> 00:33:10.635
Is it that serious?

00:33:13.888 --> 00:33:17.183
Compared to all the trouble
you've caused, it's nothing.

00:33:20.019 --> 00:33:21.020
You're coming, right?

00:33:25.399 --> 00:33:27.235
You have to come, all right?

00:33:28.277 --> 00:33:29.737
I'll take care of madam.

00:33:32.907 --> 00:33:33.866
You heard him.

00:33:34.742 --> 00:33:35.952
Don't worry about me.

00:33:37.787 --> 00:33:39.455
I won't.

00:33:41.791 --> 00:33:43.000
Let's go, Young Master.

00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:58.641
I'm not sure about this.

00:34:00.393 --> 00:34:03.062
Do you really think His Majesty's order
will draw Gil-dong out?

00:34:04.063 --> 00:34:05.106
It will.

00:34:05.648 --> 00:34:07.817
Gil-dong cherishes their lives as his own.

00:34:11.404 --> 00:34:12.822
Hey, where are you going?

00:34:21.455 --> 00:34:22.456
Hong Eun-jo!

00:34:28.421 --> 00:34:29.714
It's not your fault.

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:34.177
I'll get going.

00:34:36.971 --> 00:34:38.389
I have an idea

00:34:39.307 --> 00:34:40.683
that could save everyone.

00:34:45.563 --> 00:34:47.523
There was a letter next to the report.

00:35:02.079 --> 00:35:04.749
Everything my father values is in here.

00:35:04.832 --> 00:35:06.334
Is it like some ledger?

00:35:06.834 --> 00:35:08.502
Go in and see for yourself.

00:35:12.173 --> 00:35:14.050
So what is your idea? Where is it?

00:35:20.014 --> 00:35:21.474
What are you doing?

00:35:21.557 --> 00:35:22.600
Meeting my end like a man.

00:35:23.976 --> 00:35:25.853
I'm the one who brought that name up.

00:35:25.937 --> 00:35:28.272
So I will end this with the same name.

00:35:32.693 --> 00:35:33.861
No.

00:35:33.945 --> 00:35:35.112
No, don't do it.

00:35:36.197 --> 00:35:37.198
This…

00:35:37.823 --> 00:35:40.534
This isn't helping me at all.

00:35:41.494 --> 00:35:44.330
There must be another way.
Let's find it together.

00:35:45.456 --> 00:35:47.291
Come on. Open the door.

00:35:47.375 --> 00:35:48.626
Open the door.

00:35:48.709 --> 00:35:49.710
Don't forgive me.

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:52.922
On the day you joined this family,

00:35:53.422 --> 00:35:55.424
I stomped all over your palanquin.

00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:57.051
I got myself drunk…

00:35:59.053 --> 00:36:00.846
and lingered around your room.

00:36:01.722 --> 00:36:03.266
And I…

00:36:10.147 --> 00:36:11.357
Don't forgive any of it.

00:36:13.484 --> 00:36:14.527
I won't.

00:36:16.612 --> 00:36:18.656
If you leave like this,
I'll never forgive you.

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:30.710
My lord,

00:36:31.585 --> 00:36:35.506
my death as Gil-dong
will be this family's only honor,

00:36:35.589 --> 00:36:37.258
so please be proud of it.

00:36:44.765 --> 00:36:46.976
I cared for a woman,

00:36:53.149 --> 00:36:55.985
and through those feelings,
I came to know the joy of existence.

00:36:57.278 --> 00:37:00.197
So please don't pity my life too much.

00:37:01.657 --> 00:37:03.492
I was ashamed that you were a flatterer,

00:37:03.576 --> 00:37:05.202
and that was my failing as your son.

00:37:06.287 --> 00:37:07.663
So please blame me.

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:11.792
I will wait for you on the other side.

00:37:11.876 --> 00:37:12.710
JAE-I

00:37:13.919 --> 00:37:16.339
You have a long journey ahead.
Please travel safely.

00:37:19.967 --> 00:37:22.136
When can I let her go?

00:37:22.219 --> 00:37:25.556
Let her out
when this family holds a funeral.

00:37:25.639 --> 00:37:27.350
Is someone dying again?

00:37:29.935 --> 00:37:31.103
Thank you

00:37:32.021 --> 00:37:33.105
for everything.

00:37:37.193 --> 00:37:38.152
What should we do?

00:37:40.279 --> 00:37:41.614
Carry out the sentence.

00:37:42.948 --> 00:37:45.368
Curfew has begun! Hang the criminal!

00:38:07.014 --> 00:38:08.432
Will Gil-dong show up?

00:39:08.826 --> 00:39:09.869
You…

00:39:11.662 --> 00:39:13.205
You really had to…

00:39:26.093 --> 00:39:28.512
Grab Jae-i over there and silence him.

00:39:30.973 --> 00:39:32.433
My lord,

00:39:32.516 --> 00:39:33.601
over there.

00:39:37.646 --> 00:39:39.148
Is that…

00:39:40.983 --> 00:39:42.276
Gil-dong?

00:39:43.194 --> 00:39:45.154
Gil-dong is here! Capture him!

00:39:46.489 --> 00:39:47.656
Yes, sir!

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.033
Gil-dong?

00:39:49.116 --> 00:39:50.910
- He really showed up.
- Is it really Gil-dong?

00:39:55.247 --> 00:39:56.999
He went east!

00:40:02.046 --> 00:40:03.464
He went west!

00:40:04.381 --> 00:40:05.508
What?

00:40:15.351 --> 00:40:16.894
What a stubborn fool.

00:40:21.565 --> 00:40:23.609
- Gil-dong is here!
- This way!

00:40:30.324 --> 00:40:31.992
No, he's going south. Let's split up.

00:40:32.076 --> 00:40:33.369
Yes, sir!

00:40:38.749 --> 00:40:39.792
Over there!

00:40:46.465 --> 00:40:47.800
Is he a ghost or what?

00:40:47.883 --> 00:40:50.427
The rumors were true. He's a monster.

00:40:51.345 --> 00:40:52.304
No.

00:40:53.055 --> 00:40:54.139
That's wrong.

00:40:54.932 --> 00:40:56.308
Gil-dong is…

00:40:57.851 --> 00:40:59.645
more than one person.

00:41:02.106 --> 00:41:04.525
- Split up and find the rest!
- Yes, sir!

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:09.947
Report this to His Majesty
and put the criminal back in jail.

00:41:11.198 --> 00:41:12.408
Put the criminal back in jail!

00:41:25.462 --> 00:41:28.048
Why did you come here?

00:41:31.802 --> 00:41:33.012
It's me.

00:41:37.099 --> 00:41:39.810
No, I can't do this!

00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:43.939
Stop it. I can't go.

00:41:46.942 --> 00:41:48.819
Physician Hong sent me. Follow me.

00:41:49.653 --> 00:41:50.654
Sure.

00:41:57.578 --> 00:41:58.704
Your Majesty.

00:42:06.128 --> 00:42:07.963
It's down.

00:42:12.635 --> 00:42:15.095
Your Majesty, Gil-dong showed up…

00:42:44.249 --> 00:42:46.460
Stay right there.

00:42:59.014 --> 00:43:00.182
It's Gil-dong!

00:43:01.809 --> 00:43:03.060
Gil-dong is here!

00:44:42.993 --> 00:44:44.369
This place is…

00:45:11.563 --> 00:45:14.274
Did you bring me
to Chief Censor's residence on purpose?

00:45:16.193 --> 00:45:17.319
There you are.

00:45:19.404 --> 00:45:21.406
You're the real Gil-dong.

00:45:46.223 --> 00:45:47.975
How did you know…

00:45:54.273 --> 00:45:56.108
I know you're out there.

00:45:56.775 --> 00:45:58.860
Please answer me.

00:45:58.944 --> 00:46:01.446
My lady, you'll strain your voice!

00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:04.533
I'll open the doors soon,
so don't wear yourself out.

00:46:04.616 --> 00:46:06.493
Young Master Jae-i is going to die!

00:46:06.577 --> 00:46:08.662
- What?
- So open the door.

00:46:08.745 --> 00:46:10.455
Or everyone will die!

00:46:10.539 --> 00:46:11.582
Please!

00:46:16.253 --> 00:46:17.629
Eun-jo, you can't go.

00:46:17.713 --> 00:46:18.714
Lady Hae-rim.

00:46:18.797 --> 00:46:20.757
Don't let those protecting you…

00:46:20.841 --> 00:46:22.217
die in vain.

00:46:25.887 --> 00:46:26.930
Lady Hae-rim.

00:46:29.016 --> 00:46:30.267
Come with me.

00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:31.643
There's something you must know.

00:46:32.519 --> 00:46:33.979
Together with Lord Im Sa-hyeong?

00:46:35.856 --> 00:46:38.483
I almost died out there in the mountains.

00:46:40.944 --> 00:46:43.947
Do you remember what the king ordered
before you were dragged off?

00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:48.869
"Find those who brought the incense
into my bedchamber

00:46:48.952 --> 00:46:50.203
and kill them all."

00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:52.539
Incense?

00:46:53.290 --> 00:46:56.501
If the incense isn't lit on time,
His Majesty's madness grows worse.

00:47:02.382 --> 00:47:05.052
Can you tell me the name
of that herb from the Ming?

00:47:05.719 --> 00:47:07.429
It is the seed of a flower called Gokdu,

00:47:07.512 --> 00:47:09.723
a medicinal herb found only in the Ming.

00:47:10.307 --> 00:47:12.559
I think I know what the incense is.

00:47:17.606 --> 00:47:19.107
Who are you?

00:47:25.489 --> 00:47:27.532
He led His Majesty into addiction

00:47:27.616 --> 00:47:29.242
and dishonored the throne and the realm.

00:47:29.326 --> 00:47:30.410
- Arrest him!
- Yes, sir!

00:47:30.494 --> 00:47:31.411
Aide!

00:47:31.495 --> 00:47:33.538
Do you really believe that lowly thief?

00:47:33.622 --> 00:47:34.623
How dare you?

00:47:35.207 --> 00:47:36.708
Arrest him…

00:47:38.335 --> 00:47:39.961
What are you doing?

00:47:40.045 --> 00:47:41.922
Arrest him at once!

00:47:42.005 --> 00:47:44.633
A flatterer's words are hard to believe.

00:47:52.182 --> 00:47:54.017
Who on earth are you?

00:47:54.935 --> 00:47:55.977
The people.

00:47:58.021 --> 00:48:00.982
The name you should fear.

00:48:04.486 --> 00:48:06.029
You're a woman.

00:48:12.619 --> 00:48:14.454
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

00:48:19.418 --> 00:48:22.963
The ruler of this nation was fooled
by a flatterer and lost his mind?

00:48:25.841 --> 00:48:27.092
That cannot be true.

00:48:28.051 --> 00:48:29.344
It shouldn't be true.

00:48:30.011 --> 00:48:32.222
It's just a message posted in the market.

00:48:32.305 --> 00:48:35.434
He may have a temper,
but he cannot be so foolish.

00:48:36.393 --> 00:48:38.186
I hope it's not true either.

00:48:39.563 --> 00:48:40.647
Is the king

00:48:41.481 --> 00:48:42.858
really addicted?

00:48:47.863 --> 00:48:51.491
What are the Crown Prince and I to do now?

00:48:54.369 --> 00:48:55.704
Please don't cry.

00:48:55.787 --> 00:48:58.331
I will protect you. I promise.

00:49:04.045 --> 00:49:06.548
Bring all the troops into the capital.

00:49:06.631 --> 00:49:09.968
I shall hunt Gil-dong!

00:49:10.051 --> 00:49:10.969
Yes, Your Majesty!

00:49:26.985 --> 00:49:29.696
The scholars and students
of the Royal Confucian Academy on our side

00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:30.906
will rally soon.

00:49:31.698 --> 00:49:33.950
I'll head to the leper camp.

00:49:42.834 --> 00:49:44.127
Master Mibul?

00:49:44.211 --> 00:49:45.587
Gil-dong went that way!

00:49:52.761 --> 00:49:53.929
Have you seen Gil-dong?

00:49:54.846 --> 00:49:56.306
He went that way.

00:49:58.016 --> 00:50:00.894
Why are you lying to us?
Gil-dong went that way.

00:50:02.521 --> 00:50:04.022
You wench.

00:50:04.105 --> 00:50:05.315
You know Gil-dong!

00:50:09.945 --> 00:50:11.321
Stop there!

00:50:17.244 --> 00:50:18.411
Stop!

00:50:21.748 --> 00:50:23.124
The next alley!

00:50:27.212 --> 00:50:28.046
Chase her!

00:50:29.464 --> 00:50:30.507
This way!

00:50:39.474 --> 00:50:40.892
Let's go that way!

00:51:05.792 --> 00:51:06.835
Your Highness.

00:51:08.128 --> 00:51:09.045
What happened?

00:51:09.796 --> 00:51:12.966
There are Gil-dong impostors
all over the capital in Baekjeong masks.

00:51:13.049 --> 00:51:14.301
So I had not other option.

00:51:15.218 --> 00:51:18.013
I don't know what's going on,
but I should play along.

00:51:20.348 --> 00:51:22.225
Who are all those Gil-dong impostors?

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:25.687
Aide Kang, the people from the leper camp,

00:51:25.770 --> 00:51:27.689
and the people sent by Lady Sukeui.

00:51:28.356 --> 00:51:29.941
So I know all those Gil-dongs.

00:51:30.734 --> 00:51:33.153
I had no idea,
and I was so awkward around them.

00:51:34.529 --> 00:51:35.405
Why are you laughing?

00:51:36.781 --> 00:51:39.117
Even at a time like this,
I'm happy to hear your joke,

00:51:40.118 --> 00:51:42.287
and even at a time like this,
your joke makes me laugh.

00:51:43.288 --> 00:51:45.040
Don't laugh. I'm serious.

00:51:45.790 --> 00:51:48.585
When you go out,
you should say hi to the Gil-dongs.

00:51:48.668 --> 00:51:49.753
No.

00:51:50.503 --> 00:51:52.422
There's only one Gil-dong I've ever known.

00:51:53.089 --> 00:51:54.507
And I can barely handle that one.

00:51:59.512 --> 00:52:01.181
You look serious now.

00:52:01.264 --> 00:52:02.349
That was a joke.

00:52:03.683 --> 00:52:04.768
It's funny.

00:52:06.144 --> 00:52:07.854
That Gil-dong you've ever known

00:52:07.938 --> 00:52:09.940
needs to say something
hard to handle again.

00:52:11.399 --> 00:52:13.818
And it'll be even harder for you.

00:52:13.902 --> 00:52:15.070
I know.

00:52:16.446 --> 00:52:18.573
The actual name of the seed is Yeonsukhwa.

00:52:19.658 --> 00:52:21.952
Gokdu must be a name Im Sa-hyeong made up.

00:52:22.661 --> 00:52:23.995
How did you…

00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:28.500
Wait, so the goods
he traded with the Ming merchants was…

00:52:31.544 --> 00:52:34.089
Dae-chu will arrive soon with Lady Jang.

00:52:34.172 --> 00:52:36.925
I left as soon as
I learned about the incense,

00:52:38.927 --> 00:52:41.346
hoping that his addiction
wouldn't be so severe.

00:52:42.764 --> 00:52:44.015
I'm sure she went this way.

00:53:04.744 --> 00:53:05.870
What's the matter?

00:53:08.331 --> 00:53:09.499
This voice…

00:53:11.793 --> 00:53:14.129
I think the person
who covered for Gil-dong is in here,

00:53:14.713 --> 00:53:15.839
Your Majesty.

00:53:22.178 --> 00:53:23.388
Open it.

00:53:23.471 --> 00:53:24.723
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:53:34.983 --> 00:53:36.818
Wait here. I'll go.

00:53:40.321 --> 00:53:41.489
If you go out,

00:53:41.573 --> 00:53:43.908
they'll accuse you of protecting Gil-dong.

00:53:44.701 --> 00:53:47.287
If they investigate you,

00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:49.956
they'll find out
you've been harboring Gil-dong.

00:53:51.166 --> 00:53:52.459
Then it's treason.

00:53:55.503 --> 00:53:57.547
I will never let you die because of me.

00:54:00.008 --> 00:54:01.092
About for that,

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:03.678
I made up my mind long ago

00:54:04.429 --> 00:54:05.764
that I would gladly accept it.

00:54:09.642 --> 00:54:10.810
Right now,

00:54:12.479 --> 00:54:14.481
everyone is gathering,

00:54:15.106 --> 00:54:17.025
around the leper camp and our hideout.

00:54:17.609 --> 00:54:18.443
Everyone who?

00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:39.380
The people trying to get through today.

00:54:51.142 --> 00:54:52.143
And

00:54:52.852 --> 00:54:54.854
people trying to fight for tomorrow.

00:55:04.531 --> 00:55:05.657
And that is why

00:55:06.241 --> 00:55:07.659
you cannot stop here.

00:55:08.159 --> 00:55:10.954
You must be part of their tomorrow.

00:55:13.748 --> 00:55:14.958
What about me?

00:55:17.377 --> 00:55:19.546
What can I do
if you're not there tomorrow?

00:55:29.931 --> 00:55:30.849
Dream.

00:55:34.686 --> 00:55:37.188
We've come this far,
sharing the same dream.

00:55:38.606 --> 00:55:39.691
I…

00:55:43.361 --> 00:55:44.612
will be in that dream.

00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:50.660
Hong Eun-jo, I…

00:55:51.911 --> 00:55:53.037
I know.

00:56:00.670 --> 00:56:01.754
I…

00:56:11.306 --> 00:56:12.348
I know.

00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:16.895
No.

00:56:17.854 --> 00:56:18.813
You don't know.

00:56:20.815 --> 00:56:22.358
You don't know anything.

00:56:25.612 --> 00:56:26.654
Hong Eun-jo.

00:56:27.822 --> 00:56:29.949
I hate that we have the same dream.

00:56:32.493 --> 00:56:33.995
The today we must get through

00:56:35.330 --> 00:56:36.831
and those people's tomorrow…

00:56:38.875 --> 00:56:40.752
Right now, I'd rather hate all that.

00:56:46.257 --> 00:56:47.425
I should go.

00:56:50.970 --> 00:56:52.013
I will…

00:56:52.889 --> 00:56:54.474
see you again.

00:56:56.935 --> 00:56:58.353
I'm not that ambitious a man.

00:56:58.436 --> 00:57:00.939
Even if that disappoints you,
that's just how I am.

00:57:02.315 --> 00:57:03.858
I must confess now.

00:57:18.706 --> 00:57:19.916
My dream…

00:57:34.847 --> 00:57:36.015
has always…

00:57:37.934 --> 00:57:39.143
been you.

00:59:49.399 --> 00:59:52.026
{\an8}The old me would have listened to it.

00:59:52.110 --> 00:59:53.403
{\an8}But now,

00:59:53.486 --> 00:59:55.113
{\an8}those words carry no weight with me.

00:59:55.196 --> 00:59:56.406
{\an8}I will not run away anymore.

00:59:56.489 --> 00:59:57.949
{\an8}Chase the tiger!

00:59:58.032 --> 00:59:59.283
{\an8}He's hallucinating.

00:59:59.367 --> 01:00:01.661
{\an8}If we let His Majesty
roam the streets like this,

01:00:01.744 --> 01:00:03.121
{\an8}he will hunt the people.

01:00:03.204 --> 01:00:06.457
{\an8}"The king was deceived by a flatterer
and took poison."

01:00:06.541 --> 01:00:07.875
{\an8}"He ended up a madman."

01:00:07.959 --> 01:00:08.876
{\an8}Traitor!

01:00:09.585 --> 01:00:12.588
{\an8}Must I raise my sword against my brother?

01:00:12.672 --> 01:00:14.090
{\an8}You must go.

01:00:14.173 --> 01:00:15.216
{\an8}It will be fine.

01:00:15.717 --> 01:00:16.801
{\an8}Because we're not alone.

01:00:18.136 --> 01:00:20.138
