WEBVTT

00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.600
Hypnotizing him to remember

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.820
is like forcing him towards his most fragile memories.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.520
The one who wants to make me forget made a mistake.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.170
For letting the housekeeper send me the diary.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.440
It’s time that you look for the culprit

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:17.990
not a lover.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.560
Grandma will probably hypnotize me

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.650
so that I’ll only remember things about me

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.830
and forget about you and the murder cases.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.400
Then I’ll hang up.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.780
I have to take care of my mom.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.740
Pleng got hypnotized by that family.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.690
Your life is in your hands.

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.210
I’ll come clean.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.470
Heaven must have seen

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.150
that I’ve already repaid all the sins I did to Thunphob.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.310
I hate murderers like you guys.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.420
I hate this family.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.580
(My name is Botpleng Thayadon.)

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.180
(My first love is Thunphob.)

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.400
(My mother brought about his death.)

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.370
You still want to follow me?

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.250
I want to go with you.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.760
(The only place I want to go)

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.190
(is the place I can be free from this guilt.)

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.760
I used to think

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.786
that there’s no truth worse than the fact that

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.270
I might be the reason for Thunphob’s death.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.730
But it’s actually not true.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.320
The fact that someone I love killed him

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.710
is the worst.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.280
If it were me.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.270
I would never forgive myself.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.600
But when it’s Mom,

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:00.880
I feel guilty.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.410
I feel like I’ve sinned.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.630
I shouldn’t even be here.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.890
I want Thunphob to forgive Mom.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.680
I have done wrong.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.520
I’ve wronged him.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:36.550
I’ve wronged Mom.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.240
And I’ve wronged you.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.770
There is a flower within my heart

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.440
Daisy, Daisy

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.770
Planted one day by a glancing dart

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.430
Planted by Daisy Bell

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:37.320
Whether you love me or love me not

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.890
Sometimes it’s hard to tell

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.430
Yet I am longing to share the lot

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.640
A beautiful daisy bell

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.660
You forgive me, right?

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:24.870
Yeah.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:10.310
Do I look like a mess?

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.270
Yeah.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.650
Your eyes are dark and swollen.

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:16.390
You look like a mess.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.870
I can’t tell if you lacked sleep

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:20.330
or have been crying this whole time.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.560
Ouch.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.080
Ow, that hurts.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.680
Is this a time to joke around?

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.170
I mean

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:36.120
things have escalated this far

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:39.780
but I still make you comfort me.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.600
I’ve been talking big about accepting the truth.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.230
Even though you are hurt

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.390
no less than I am.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:59.420
Or even more.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:01.860
No matter what happens,

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.140
it can never change

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:07.560
the fact that I love you.

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:20.660
Then it can’t change

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.780
the fact that I love you a lot, too.

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:33.600
And are your eyes

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.510
the result of lack of sleep

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:39.680
or did you just cry?

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:42.760
If I say it’s the latter,

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:44.760
it wouldn’t sound cool.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.520
You can let me be cool for once.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:49.830
I want to be the one to comfort you sometimes.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:51.670
Here I am for you to comfort me.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:01.990
Please don’t cry alone again, Pleng.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.110
There’s only your heart

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:12.810
that can make me feel safe.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.400
And…

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:41.160
About my mom,

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.840
what are you going to do next?

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.560
No moves taken since yesterday.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.300
Not even an attempt to search for you.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.480
Why?

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:57.590
I don’t get it.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.230
There are 3 reasons.

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:03.860
They might be sure

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:07.010
that no one can press charges against them.

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.030
Or they might trust

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:14.700
that you won’t hurt them.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:20.850
What about the other one?

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.530
They don’t try to run

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.600
because there’s nowhere for them to run.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.280
The reason why I dared enter your house

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:49.410
was because I’ve been investigating it for a while.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.280
There was no security.

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:54.330
Only day maids.

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:57.746
As for those who used to be
your grandpa’s underlings,

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.410
they only have respect for him now.

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:01.680
There’s no influence left

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.450
at the police station.

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:11.930
Grandma has never talked to me
about my family’s money, either.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:15.560
I’ve been using my own money.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:19.670
Right now,

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:22.660
if your family were to run away,

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:24.550
it would be hard to do.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:27.080
Do you mean that.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.120
I’m the key to my family’s death or survival?

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:38.640
You’re the only one

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.300
who can solve this.

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:55.480
Should I pretend I don’t know anything

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:57.850
then you can arrest my mother.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:58.880
Would that be easier?

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:07.170
You wanted Thunphob

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:10.030
to forgive your mother, didn’t you?

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:21.596
Is this why you weren’t in a hurry

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:23.120
to get me back to Bangkok?

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.270
Someone once told me

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.660
that you should pick vegetables

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:34.340
in the evening.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.970
I read something that said

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:43.490
you should pick vegetables

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:46.400
when you want to eat it.

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:51.100
Don’t you want to eat some today?

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.980
I’ve already packed your clothes.

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:57.710
Just in case you want to stay a night here.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:05.700
Then…

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:09.450
Can you please take me home tomorrow?

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.080
Were you stealing a look at me?

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:28.490
No.

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:33.710
Are you secretly in love with me?

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:37.760
Hasn’t it been a while now?

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.400
What’s on your mind?

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.570
Can you read my mind?

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:48.970
I want to ask.

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:51.820
I’m thinking that

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:54.850
it’s so nice to have you.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.340
I think you have such a big heart

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.130
and so warm.

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:02.890
I also think that

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:05.320
with you.

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:08.780
I can get through anything.

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:13.780
What about you?

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:15.060
What are you thinking?

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.490
Why are you still here with me now?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.760
I’ve never thought I would sit by a river with anyone

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.440
until you came along.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.920
A daisy?

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:57.210
I know there are times
when you want to be alone.

00:14:58.090 --> 00:14:59.770
When you want to spend time with yourself.

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:01.290
And I

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:03.430
won’t disturb you.

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.760
But I don’t want you to think that

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.490
you have no one.

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:11.070
I want you to know that

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:13.460
you’ll always find me right here.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:32.230
You can’t stop my heart

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.080
from following you.

00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:58.370
I can read your mind, too.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.650
I think saying our heart aligns

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:03.580
would sound more romantic.

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:06.450
Okay.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.140
Our hearts align.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.240
You know what?

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:23.050
You’re not the second violin in Canon in D.

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:29.970
But you’re the first note

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.650
in my Daisy Bell.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.440
Thank you.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.240
Yes?

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.490
Are you sure

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:06.180
about going home alone?

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:08.410
Yes.

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:10.490
Let me talk to her myself.

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.500
It might be easier when there’s just me.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.150
Tanu confessed that he killed everyone.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.200
Don’t you think it’s better

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.680
to let everything end like this?

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.860
If I knew my mom did something wrong

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:26.990
and just let it slide,

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:30.390
I wouldn’t dare ask for Thunphob’s forgiveness.

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:32.950
And I wouldn’t dare love you.

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:43.850
I love you.

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:45.390
I know.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:46.780
I knew it even before you did.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.340
I’m not walking in there alone.

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:54.860
I have this with me.

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.040
Yes?

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:47.650
Can you come to BID right now?

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:01.340
You’re back?

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.650
Professor.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.840
I’ve already sent you the file

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:21.320
with Tanu’s full confession.

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.910
This is the behavior observation form.

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:24.930
Thank you.

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:30.050
Tanu has already admitted to all his crimes

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:34.070
why do both you and Inspector Dao

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:35.770
make it seem like there’s something wrong?

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:36.900
Dao too?

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.040
Yes.

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:40.780
After Tanu came clean,

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:43.270
Inspector Dao has been re-watching

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:44.370
the confession video.

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.620
She seemed stressed out for a while.

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:47.660
Then she just left.

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:52.269
Lt. Nim, let me see that interrogation video.

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:54.160
I’ll consult with my investigation team first.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:55.389
Sure, professor.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.941
Hey, this is urgent.

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:10.763
Tanu’s already confessed

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:13.500
that he was the one who killed Thunphob

00:20:14.603 --> 00:20:16.600
and the other 2
who were involved with our family.

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.509
Can you tell me.

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:26.669
When you say you brought about Thunphob’s death,

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:28.670
what did you mean by that?

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.014
You must want to hear that

00:20:34.065 --> 00:20:37.003
we’re the ones who killed him, huh?

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.327
I just want the truth.

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:46.647
I want to know why you and Mom

00:20:46.683 --> 00:20:48.283
keep hypnotising me to make me forget.

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:52.101
Or is there any of my memory

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:55.185
that has to do with everyone’s death?

00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:59.149
Including Dad’s, right?

00:20:59.301 --> 00:21:00.080
Nonsense.

00:21:00.109 --> 00:21:01.109
Mom!

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.141
Botpleng.

00:21:12.189 --> 00:21:13.309
The thing is…

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:18.967
Oh, Dao.

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:21.083
Inspector Dao.

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.265
Aren’t you supposed to be with Tankhun?

00:21:32.007 --> 00:21:33.425
The Governor sent me the verdict

00:21:33.454 --> 00:21:35.774
saying that those involved in the concession
were innocent.

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:38.000
The rumor spread from the slander

00:21:38.029 --> 00:21:39.629
stemming from a local politics conflict.

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:42.523
Doctor Chomphon was the one
who saw things through

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.050
after Pleng’s dad died.

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:47.694
Botpleng’s dad died due to a heart attack.

00:21:47.716 --> 00:21:49.010
He was not murdered.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.229
That’s not possible.

00:21:52.276 --> 00:21:54.280
If that case was done right,

00:21:54.341 --> 00:21:55.229
then why did someone try

00:21:55.287 --> 00:21:57.563
to make Inspector Dao stop investigating?

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:01.890
Inspector Dao investigated this case too?

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:03.050
Yes.

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:05.730
It was her first case after moving here.

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:07.170
What’s going on?

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.847
Why did Inspector Dao have to deal with this case?

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:14.363
It was Doctor Chomphon
who cleared the case for Botpleng’s dad.

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.465
He’s also Inspector Dao’s father.

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:18.460
It was Dao?

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:20.530
Guys, excuse me.

00:22:21.381 --> 00:22:22.381
Tankhun!

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:25.912
(Urgent report!)

00:22:25.941 --> 00:22:29.570
(Tanu, the suspect of the serial murder case)

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:30.814
(has managed to escape.)

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:32.370
How did you do that?

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:34.310
Which one?

00:22:36.494 --> 00:22:37.934
If it’s Tanu’s case,

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:39.630
that wasn’t hard.

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:41.985
I have my people.

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.207
Or is it about your mom and grandma?

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:48.610
That’s even easier.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:51.156
Those at your house,

00:22:51.185 --> 00:22:52.778
they’re all my people.

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:56.676
I just tell them to spike the drinks

00:22:56.712 --> 00:22:57.949
before I get there.

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:00.647
But it went wrong because

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.152
you happened to be there

00:23:02.189 --> 00:23:03.510
instead of with Tankhun.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.734
So you’ll have to

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.774
become another one of Tanu’s victims.

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:12.603
You let Tanu go

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.349
to put the blame on him?

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:17.294
It’s too late to be smart now.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:20.960
We’re almost there.

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:22.880
Get ready.

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.429
(Your life is in your hands.)

00:23:32.465 --> 00:23:34.065
(Pick a smarter choice)

00:23:34.116 --> 00:23:37.840
(and let the Thayadon face their karma.)

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:39.934
Damn it!

00:23:39.949 --> 00:23:41.381
Why did I just check it out?

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:43.330
What’s up with the interrogation video?

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:45.570
It wasn’t just an interrogation video.

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:47.585
Dao intentionally framed Tanu

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:49.621
and Botpleng’s family.

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:51.112
Dao is behind all this.

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:53.229
Dao is the daughter of Dr. Chomphon

00:23:53.265 --> 00:23:54.821
who was close to Botpleng’s family.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:56.763
That means…

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.640
The reason why she dug up the concession case

00:24:00.669 --> 00:24:02.007
was to hurt Madame.

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:03.898
What’s even going on?

00:24:03.956 --> 00:24:04.956
I don’t know.

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:06.640
I only know that right now,

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.661
Pleng is in trouble.

00:24:08.705 --> 00:24:10.029
Damn it, Pleng.

00:24:10.058 --> 00:24:11.156
Why did you go with them?

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:13.869
I have him carry a GPS device with him.

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:19.578
Keep this with you at all times.

00:24:19.614 --> 00:24:20.814
You can keep it in your socks

00:24:20.858 --> 00:24:21.883
so you wouldn’t lose it.

00:24:21.927 --> 00:24:24.821
It’s accurate and harder to kill the signal

00:24:24.858 --> 00:24:26.218
compared to the ones on the phone.

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:27.920
You should keep one too

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:29.389
so that I can find you as well.

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:33.738
You don’t know

00:24:33.781 --> 00:24:35.549
that I started buying things in pairs

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:37.680
since the first time I met you.

00:24:39.745 --> 00:24:40.698
Okay.

00:24:40.734 --> 00:24:41.734
I get it.

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:03.541
Can you go faster?

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:12.880
Mom.

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:14.887
How are you doing?

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:16.356
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:18.290
Kan.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:18.952
Kan.

00:25:18.974 --> 00:25:19.974
Mom.

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:50.654
Why did you do this?

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.403
I’ve been taking good care of you all this time.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.360
Taking good care of me?

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:00.680
Bullshit.

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:03.020
You

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:05.600
were the one who ruined my family.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000
Doctor!

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:16.778
(Almost every day at dawn, )

00:26:16.829 --> 00:26:18.334
(Dad would visit your house.)

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.072
See that?

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:22.450
Your dad is a traitor!

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:25.170
See what your dad does?

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:39.250
Mom!

00:26:40.152 --> 00:26:41.152
Mom!

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:42.545
Mom!

00:26:42.574 --> 00:26:43.701
Mom!

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:45.520
Wake up, Mom!

00:26:45.556 --> 00:26:47.214
Mom!

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:48.421
Mom!

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:54.420
Dad.

00:26:56.487 --> 00:26:58.490
You’re still choosing her even now?

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.618
It was because you and she

00:27:00.661 --> 00:27:02.029
that Mom died.

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:08.970
Nonsense.

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:11.614
There’s nothing going on.

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:13.570
I’m a doctor.

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:15.840
I’m just there to treat her.

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.480
You and your mom are crazy.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.210
The reason why Dr. Chomphon was dead

00:27:42.792 --> 00:27:44.790
can’t have been an accident.

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:49.716
That’s right.

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.970
You guys ruined my family.

00:27:54.807 --> 00:27:56.810
You turned me into an orphan.

00:27:57.309 --> 00:27:59.310
Do you think everything you did

00:27:59.345 --> 00:28:01.061
can make up for that?

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:05.672
What about that housekeeper and the clerk?

00:28:05.694 --> 00:28:07.056
What did they have to do with this?

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.232
Why did you kill them?

00:28:08.261 --> 00:28:09.280
Why do you want to know?

00:28:10.625 --> 00:28:12.630
You’d soon be dead just like them.

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:14.960
So that I can tell the dead

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.996
how evil you are.

00:28:18.916 --> 00:28:20.458
F*ck!

00:28:20.509 --> 00:28:21.803
How can you guys not realize it?!

00:28:21.825 --> 00:28:23.650
You guys are the wicked ones!

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.774
You also killed Thunphob.

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:29.767
I found the diary

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.534
so I knew

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:34.429
that Thunphob died
because he came to see you.

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:37.030
So right now,

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.232
I’ll have to take revenge on everyone’s behalf.

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:42.060
That day,

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:45.374
I had the housekeeper kid send you the diary.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:50.858
(That kid)

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:53.905
(was the son of the one
who helped you cheat on the concession.)

00:28:53.941 --> 00:28:55.490
(So he has to pay.)

00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:00.872
Hello? I’m already here.

00:29:00.909 --> 00:29:02.370
Are you coming?

00:29:02.407 --> 00:29:03.665
(That lady was the clerk)

00:29:03.709 --> 00:29:05.709
(who helped your dad cheat.)

00:29:05.752 --> 00:29:07.040
(All I had to do)

00:29:07.083 --> 00:29:09.556
(was to place the fishing line at your house.)

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:12.145
So you sent the diary to me

00:29:12.181 --> 00:29:13.810
to have me and Tankhun meet up.

00:29:13.847 --> 00:29:15.360
Then you made Tankhun think that

00:29:15.389 --> 00:29:16.989
I was the one who found the body, right?

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:22.330
That’s right!

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:25.469
So he will know

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.800
who’s the best in class.

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.741
But he just happened to jump in beforehand!

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.527
So he became your witness!

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:40.640
Tan!

00:29:40.683 --> 00:29:42.243
Because you’re just the second in class

00:29:43.927 --> 00:29:45.930
who can never beat the number one.

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:48.501
How did you get here?

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:54.312
Because I’m the number one.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:25.960
Hey.

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:27.570
I’m safe.

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:30.138
Your brother went inside to check on Pleng.

00:30:30.181 --> 00:30:31.190
By the way,

00:30:31.221 --> 00:30:33.190
when are you and the police going to arrive?

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:41.701
(Are you okay?)

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:43.665
I don’t get hurt that easily.

00:30:43.709 --> 00:30:45.214
Otherwise, I wouldn’t dare come here.

00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:55.832
What’s this joke?

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:00.420
It’s right what you’re thinking, Inspector.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.734
Tankhun and I are inseparable.

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:04.967
If we were to separate,

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:08.130
that’s only when I’m sure he would find me.

00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:14.290
Damn you.

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:16.712
I tried to help you

00:31:16.734 --> 00:31:18.909
but you keep digging your own grave!

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:21.912
It could have ended with your mom!

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:24.552
Your mom is a murderer.

00:31:25.389 --> 00:31:27.003
I dug and found

00:31:27.032 --> 00:31:29.000
that your mom killed Thunphob

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:32.232
and covered her own son’s memory.

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:34.167
That’s because her son knew

00:31:34.218 --> 00:31:35.578
that she had an affair.

00:31:37.381 --> 00:31:38.669
And your younger brother,

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:42.225
who had to help revive his memory,

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:44.603
unluckily got dragged into it.

00:31:45.105 --> 00:31:46.105
Then Tanu

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:47.694
was the one who ruined your plan.

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:51.680
Tanu’s appearance changed the assumptions.

00:31:52.152 --> 00:31:53.614
So you tried to do everything

00:31:53.643 --> 00:31:55.250
to find the link between Tanu

00:31:55.287 --> 00:31:56.509
and Pleng’s family.

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.829
The fishing line

00:31:58.858 --> 00:32:01.367
was some false evidence that you made up.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:02.800
Yeah.

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:07.781
But you came up with some damn theory

00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:09.621
saying there are two murderers.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.458
Damn! I was laughing so hard!

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.494
I almost died of laughter

00:32:14.523 --> 00:32:16.770
when you went on the show
to lure out the suspect.

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:19.796
F*ck, I was right beside you!

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:22.680
So what?

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:24.356
Sooner or later,

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.880
I still figure out what you’re up to.

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:28.189
Even if you killed everyone here,

00:32:28.218 --> 00:32:29.541
do you think you can get away?

00:32:29.563 --> 00:32:30.778
Who would ever believe you?

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:33.985
Then you can be the first to die.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.160
Tan!

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.105
That’s not it!

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.316
Petchkla never cheated

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.694
and I never had an affair.

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:48.283
I didn’t kill Thunphob!

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:50.523
You!

00:32:50.545 --> 00:32:52.520
You’re still lying even now.

00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:56.450
Tan!

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.592
Pleng! Go!

00:32:57.621 --> 00:32:58.621
Get off me!

00:33:11.978 --> 00:33:12.661
Urgh!

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:14.290
Stop it!

00:33:14.312 --> 00:33:15.498
Let go of me!

00:33:15.541 --> 00:33:16.541
Let go!

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:17.600
Let go of me!

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:21.585
Mrs. Khitakan didn’t do it.

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:24.720
I did it!

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:27.054
Why did you do it?

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:28.792
Because that person

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:32.683
was going to tell everyone that Botpleng’s dead.

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:41.127
What the hell are you saying?

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:43.330
Botpleng is sitting right here.

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.945
Like shit, he’s dead!

00:33:44.974 --> 00:33:46.058
Shut up!

00:33:46.087 --> 00:33:47.694
I said I did it!

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:49.323
Let go of me!

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.600
Tontharn.

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:57.640
Dad is sorry.

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:07.730
(My name is Botpleng Thayadon)

00:34:08.632 --> 00:34:10.630
(The only child of my parents.)

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.163
How is it going, Tanu?

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:16.327
Hello, Mrs. Kan.

00:34:16.363 --> 00:34:17.396
Hello, Mr. Petch.

00:34:25.738 --> 00:34:27.818
BOTPLENG THAYADON.

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:33.752
His handwriting is just like Botpleng’s.

00:34:33.781 --> 00:34:35.985
They were probably brothers in the previous life.

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:39.425
Thank you so much, Mrs. Kan,

00:34:39.469 --> 00:34:41.585
for supporting Tharn’s study.

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:44.790
Hey.

00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:46.138
Say thank you to Mrs. Kan.

00:34:46.174 --> 00:34:47.658
TONTHARN THIWFON.

00:34:47.687 --> 00:34:49.447
Thank you, Mrs. Kan.

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:53.272
No, I told you to call me “Mom”.

00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:59.054
Thank you, Mom.

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:11.432
Be my brother, Tontharn.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:13.840
(No.)

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:17.454
(I’m not Botpleng.)

00:35:19.018 --> 00:35:21.020
(I am Tontharn Thiwfon.)

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:24.130
(Tanu’s son.)

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:36.560
You’re back already, Mom?

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:40.763
I’m cooking some rice.

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.970
Please wait a bit.

00:35:46.021 --> 00:35:47.214
Ow!

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.440
I knew what you did.

00:35:49.483 --> 00:35:51.365
You went to play with the boy from that family again, right?

00:35:51.389 --> 00:35:53.029
You want to become their son so bad, huh?

00:35:53.054 --> 00:35:53.760
I’m sorry.

00:35:53.796 --> 00:35:55.328
You want to become their son so bad, huh?

00:35:55.352 --> 00:35:57.090
It hurts, Mom!

00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.000
- I’m sorry.
- Get out of my house!

00:35:58.036 --> 00:35:59.381
I love you, Mom.

00:35:59.418 --> 00:36:00.640
You bastard of a son!

00:36:00.974 --> 00:36:02.101
You horrible son!

00:36:02.123 --> 00:36:03.352
Get out!

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:09.352
You got hit by your mom again?

00:36:09.752 --> 00:36:11.192
I told you to stand up for yourself.

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.110
But she’s my mom, Mr. Pleng.

00:36:17.461 --> 00:36:19.549
I told you to call me brother.

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:25.512
But my mom doesn’t want me to get close to you.

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.909
To me, you’re my younger brother.

00:36:29.396 --> 00:36:31.400
To Mom, you’re a son.

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:33.481
Don’t you want to be my younger brother

00:36:33.505 --> 00:36:34.778
and Mom’s son?

00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:38.850
I do.

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:41.461
I want to become Mom Kan’s son

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:44.030
and I want to become your younger brother.

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:47.767
Then trust in me.

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.705
I’ll make you my younger brother.

00:36:52.545 --> 00:36:53.607
Botpleng!

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.116
Botpleng! Tontharn!

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:57.840
Where are you?

00:36:58.520 --> 00:36:59.658
Botpleng!

00:37:08.334 --> 00:37:09.334
Pleng!

00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:11.796
Pleng!

00:37:11.832 --> 00:37:12.832
Pleng!

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:14.790
Pleng!

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:15.621
Pleng!

00:37:15.658 --> 00:37:16.658
Tontharn!

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:21.020
What happened?

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:24.830
Let’s go!

00:37:27.287 --> 00:37:29.290
Botpleng, where are you?

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:30.567
Tontharn!

00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:31.709
Hang in there, Pleng.

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:33.076
Mom Kan’s coming to get you.

00:37:33.112 --> 00:37:34.112
Mom.

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:39.040
Tontharn!

00:37:39.076 --> 00:37:40.076
Pleng!

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:42.790
Pleng!

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:47.500
Pleng!

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:53.534
Botpleng!

00:37:57.243 --> 00:37:58.243
Botpleng!

00:38:15.243 --> 00:38:16.305
What the f*ck?

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.061
Botpleng.

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:20.749
Botpleng.

00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:22.538
Enough.

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:24.909
Botpleng’s long dead.

00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:26.509
Botpleng.

00:38:26.552 --> 00:38:27.808
You have to come to terms with it

00:38:27.832 --> 00:38:29.403
and accept it.

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:32.230
Son.

00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:34.261
I can remember now!

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.400
Tontharn!

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:42.510
I was the one who caused Pleng’s death.

00:38:43.498 --> 00:38:44.654
What the f*ck?

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:46.472
I’m not Botpleng.

00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:53.418
I’m Tontharn.

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:02.500
Pleng!

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:03.570
Tontharn!

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:13.360
Pleng.

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:38.060
You know what?

00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:41.680
I think something is missing in your house.

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:45.389
Ever since you’re here.

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:47.316
I don’t think anything is lacking.

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:50.792
Be serious!

00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:53.978
Am I not?

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.898
Stop it!

00:39:59.469 --> 00:40:00.152
Answer me first.

00:40:00.196 --> 00:40:01.196
Hurry up.

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:03.970
Hmm…

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:07.790
I don’t know.

00:40:08.596 --> 00:40:10.600
This place has never felt like a home to me.

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:14.378
Ever since Dad, Mom, and Thun died,

00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:16.560
Jen also didn’t want this house.

00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:18.712
Everything in this house

00:40:18.734 --> 00:40:20.710
is all my parents’ pick.

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:28.600
Then…

00:40:30.712 --> 00:40:32.710
Do you want it to be our home?

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:36.341
I want to make it our home.

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:41.960
I think.

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:44.880
I like Yai Yaem’s house.

00:40:45.592 --> 00:40:47.590
Since you can hear the waterfall all the time.

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:51.570
Shall we build a waterfall?

00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:53.770
A waterfall?

00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:55.963
Honestly,

00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:57.710
I think

00:40:58.378 --> 00:41:00.380
it sounds more soothing than a song.

00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:04.872
I’m down for whatever you say.

00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:07.870
Seriously?

00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:10.220
Yeah.

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:15.301
Then…

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:18.210
I’ll be serious too!

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:19.774
Got you!

00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:23.185
Got you!

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:32.392
He let me call him my older brother.

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:34.138
He took care of me.

00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:36.480
And asked me to be his younger brother.

00:41:36.516 --> 00:41:37.716
Hang in there, Pleng.

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:38.960
Mom Kan is coming to help you.

00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:39.592
Mom.

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:40.887
Where did Botpleng go?

00:41:41.294 --> 00:41:43.290
This Botpleng is not my Botpleng!

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:44.330
That’s not true.

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:45.738
I don’t believe you.

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:47.140
I love you, too.

00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:48.560
This you.

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:51.149
It’s always been you.
