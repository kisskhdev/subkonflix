WEBVTT

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:45.400


00:01:20.936 --> 00:01:24.106
ENDURE
AND YOU'LL SOON REACH THE SKY

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:26.317
WHAT MAKES US TRULY HUMAN

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.613
TREATING OTHERS

00:01:30.696 --> 00:01:35.492
WITH KINDNESS

00:01:35.576 --> 00:01:40.122
AND CARE

00:01:48.255 --> 00:01:49.089
Why are you here?

00:02:25.292 --> 00:02:26.585
Enough already, Yoon Bom.

00:02:28.045 --> 00:02:31.298
It's the same dream for over a year.
It's about time I got used to it.

00:02:49.441 --> 00:02:51.735
Time to start another gloomy day.

00:02:53.278 --> 00:02:54.279
Don't smile.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.323
Don't have fun.

00:02:57.491 --> 00:02:58.659
Don't be happy.

00:03:00.327 --> 00:03:01.245
You've got this.

00:03:05.165 --> 00:03:08.293
Just when we thought
spring had arrived, winter returned.

00:03:09.003 --> 00:03:11.505
{\an8}Last week was unusually warm,

00:03:11.588 --> 00:03:14.133
{\an8}but a late cold snap
is moving in this week.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.011
{\an8}As cold air pushes south
from the northwest,

00:03:17.094 --> 00:03:19.513
{\an8}a nationwide cold wave warning
is now in effect.

00:03:19.596 --> 00:03:23.308
{\an8}Temperatures in most areas are set to drop
over ten degrees from yesterday morning.

00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:33.986
{\an8}- Good morning.
- Hello.

00:03:35.821 --> 00:03:37.197
{\an8}You know Ms. Bom?

00:03:37.281 --> 00:03:39.950
{\an8}She's been here for almost a year,

00:03:40.034 --> 00:03:41.618
{\an8}and I've never heard her talk.

00:03:42.411 --> 00:03:44.371
{\an8}I just don't get it, I really don't.

00:03:44.913 --> 00:03:46.457
{\an8}No matter how much time passes,

00:03:47.041 --> 00:03:49.460
{\an8}all she does is nod or sulk all the time.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.505
She's always in those dull, dark clothes.

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:54.590
What's her deal?

00:03:55.174 --> 00:03:56.717
I guess she's not much of a talker.

00:03:57.468 --> 00:03:58.594
As if.

00:03:58.677 --> 00:04:01.096
I never listened to my parents as a kid.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.474
One day, when I was five,
my dad put me in the car

00:04:03.557 --> 00:04:05.100
and dropped me off at an empty lot.

00:04:05.184 --> 00:04:06.018
My goodness.

00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:09.063
He said I wasn't his daughter anymore.

00:04:09.146 --> 00:04:10.731
So what did you say?

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.569
I said, "Mister, drop me off
at the orphanage

00:04:15.652 --> 00:04:17.529
instead of here, please."

00:04:19.907 --> 00:04:23.035
Every time I spoke,
I totally slayed the audience,

00:04:23.118 --> 00:04:25.079
so they called me the Story Slayer.

00:04:42.596 --> 00:04:45.682
{\an8}People said seeing the ethics teacher
gave them unethical thoughts,

00:04:46.642 --> 00:04:48.644
{\an8}so they called me
the Goddess of Temptation.

00:04:48.727 --> 00:04:49.561
ETHICS GODDESS

00:04:50.938 --> 00:04:52.648
There's something off about her.

00:04:52.731 --> 00:04:55.692
I mean, the teachers here
are trying to leave for Seoul.

00:04:55.776 --> 00:04:58.654
Why would she come to this countryside
on her own?

00:04:59.196 --> 00:05:00.364
It's clear as day.

00:05:00.447 --> 00:05:03.492
If she's here as an exchange teacher,
she's stuck for two years.

00:05:03.575 --> 00:05:06.495
She must've caused some major trouble.

00:05:06.578 --> 00:05:08.080
You'd know more than us, right?

00:05:08.163 --> 00:05:10.791
She at least talks to you sometimes.

00:05:10.874 --> 00:05:13.710
Not really. She only talks to me
when she's paying rent.

00:05:14.878 --> 00:05:17.589
Trust me, it's best you don't know
for your own peace of mind.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.758
Hello, Ms. Yoon.

00:05:19.842 --> 00:05:21.510
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Hello.

00:05:21.593 --> 00:05:23.095
- Hey, twins.
- Good morning.

00:05:23.178 --> 00:05:24.638
- Good morning.
- Morning.

00:05:25.681 --> 00:05:27.683
- Hurry, get going.
- Hi, Ms. Bom.

00:05:37.609 --> 00:05:38.569
Han-gyul!

00:05:38.652 --> 00:05:40.696
Yeah, thanks.

00:05:41.613 --> 00:05:43.031
Every time I see him,

00:05:43.115 --> 00:05:45.450
it brings back memories of my school days.

00:05:46.201 --> 00:05:47.619
- Right?
- Yeah, right.

00:05:48.287 --> 00:05:50.372
He's in the same class as my twins.

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:52.666
How can they be so different?

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:54.042
I can't believe they're mine.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.461
If that's how their mom sees them,

00:05:57.212 --> 00:05:58.839
what about their homeroom teacher?

00:06:03.927 --> 00:06:04.803
Hold on.

00:06:04.887 --> 00:06:06.305
Han-gyul, look at me.

00:06:06.388 --> 00:06:07.222
Stop pushing.

00:06:07.306 --> 00:06:09.016
Han-gyul, come with me. Han-gyul!

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:10.851
- Good morning.
- Hey, Han-gyul.

00:06:13.687 --> 00:06:15.189
I have a question for you, sir.

00:06:16.315 --> 00:06:17.149
For me?

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.905
Follow me.

00:06:26.992 --> 00:06:29.995
Wait, did the front door
lock properly today?

00:06:30.078 --> 00:06:32.080
I've got a spare key.

00:06:32.164 --> 00:06:34.499
If it acts up again, just let me know.

00:06:47.346 --> 00:06:48.805
Let's all thank the teacher.

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:50.224
Thank you for today!

00:06:52.184 --> 00:06:55.270
Midterms are already
just around the corner.

00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:57.773
Starting tomorrow,

00:06:57.856 --> 00:07:00.234
students won't be allowed
in the staff room.

00:07:00.317 --> 00:07:03.487
Teachers, please make sure

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.572
- the exam papers don't get leaked.
- Yes, sir.

00:07:06.365 --> 00:07:08.951
I'm sure you all know

00:07:09.034 --> 00:07:12.412
that parent-teacher conferences
happen right after midterms, correct?

00:07:12.496 --> 00:07:14.039
Yes, sir.

00:07:14.122 --> 00:07:17.960
Homeroom teachers for each grade,
make sure to prepare in advance.

00:07:18.585 --> 00:07:22.881
This Thursday, there's going to be
a midterm training session.

00:07:23.632 --> 00:07:25.217
Everyone must attend the meeting

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.845
during lunch in the multipurpose room.
Please be on time.

00:07:28.929 --> 00:07:30.514
- I'll take attendance.
- What's this?

00:07:31.306 --> 00:07:32.349
Is the window open?

00:07:36.144 --> 00:07:39.022
During exams,
both teachers and students are busy.

00:07:39.106 --> 00:07:41.358
But this is the first written test
of the year.

00:07:41.441 --> 00:07:44.319
I ask all teachers
to do their best to ensure

00:07:44.403 --> 00:07:45.696
everything goes smoothly--

00:07:45.779 --> 00:07:50.158
Emergency!

00:07:56.164 --> 00:07:57.749
Emergency!

00:07:58.375 --> 00:07:59.251
What's going on?

00:08:07.634 --> 00:08:09.803
This is a strange feeling
I've never felt before.

00:09:03.398 --> 00:09:05.067
He's coming.

00:09:16.411 --> 00:09:18.789
What do we do? He'll be here in a minute.

00:09:18.872 --> 00:09:20.248
Mr. Hong!

00:09:20.332 --> 00:09:22.084
Tell him I'm gone for the day.

00:09:22.167 --> 00:09:24.002
Out of the way.

00:09:26.296 --> 00:09:27.297
- Mr. Hong!
- Hurry!

00:09:28.131 --> 00:09:30.133
Get out of the way.

00:09:31.593 --> 00:09:32.552
Quick, hide.

00:09:36.348 --> 00:09:37.265
NO STAFF ROOM ENTRY

00:09:51.863 --> 00:09:52.739
Is he here already?

00:09:52.823 --> 00:09:53.782
There we go.

00:09:55.158 --> 00:09:56.618
Move, get out of the way.

00:09:57.452 --> 00:09:58.578
Darn it.

00:10:00.705 --> 00:10:03.333
Don't come.

00:10:04.084 --> 00:10:05.627
Who could that be?

00:10:35.615 --> 00:10:37.200
The fabric appears

00:10:37.284 --> 00:10:39.828
to be 84% polyester and 16% elastane.

00:10:40.871 --> 00:10:44.749
Despite the snowstorm, his bare skin
doesn't even have goosebumps.

00:10:45.417 --> 00:10:46.501
Is he an athlete?

00:10:47.169 --> 00:10:48.170
No.

00:10:48.253 --> 00:10:51.006
An athlete wouldn't have
a dragon tattoo on his arm.

00:10:51.756 --> 00:10:54.050
Then, is he a gangster?

00:10:54.593 --> 00:10:57.137
A thug? Or a local lowlife?

00:11:04.144 --> 00:11:06.396
Welcome, Han-gyul's uncle.

00:11:09.816 --> 00:11:12.611
Is that guy Han-gyul's uncle?

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.656
Sorry to bother you.

00:11:17.574 --> 00:11:21.244
I'm here to see Mr. Hong Jung-pyo.

00:11:22.037 --> 00:11:23.788
Oh, dear.

00:11:23.872 --> 00:11:27.042
I'm afraid Mr. Hong had to take care
of something, so he left early.

00:11:27.125 --> 00:11:28.793
Then I'll wait until tomorrow.

00:11:29.336 --> 00:11:30.545
I've got plenty of time.

00:11:54.444 --> 00:11:57.030
Goodness! Who do we have here?

00:11:58.740 --> 00:11:59.991
Isn't this Han-gyul's uncle?

00:12:02.285 --> 00:12:03.537
You were there?

00:12:05.038 --> 00:12:08.625
I was busy with an urgent memo.
I'm sorry I didn't say hi sooner.

00:12:08.708 --> 00:12:11.336
Welcome, Han-gyul's uncle.
I'm glad you're here.

00:12:11.878 --> 00:12:13.797
What brings you to the school?

00:12:16.299 --> 00:12:17.717
Apparently, Han-gyul

00:12:17.801 --> 00:12:20.136
had been chosen
for the Filial Piety Award.

00:12:21.555 --> 00:12:23.723
But he heard it was canceled

00:12:23.807 --> 00:12:26.643
and asked Mr. Hong why this morning.

00:12:26.726 --> 00:12:28.395
This is what Mr. Hong told him.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.733
"A kid with no parents has no business
winning the Filial Piety Award."

00:12:41.157 --> 00:12:44.119
So I came to have
a one-on-one talk with him.

00:12:44.202 --> 00:12:45.954
Come on,

00:12:46.037 --> 00:12:48.582
there's no way he actually said that.

00:12:48.665 --> 00:12:50.125
Maybe Han-gyul exaggerated--

00:12:50.208 --> 00:12:52.877
He would never say
anything like that to me.

00:12:53.503 --> 00:12:54.838
I heard it from someone else.

00:12:55.547 --> 00:12:57.090
Please calm down.

00:12:57.173 --> 00:12:59.175
Coffee. Let's have some coffee.

00:13:00.135 --> 00:13:02.304
Ms. Bom, a cup of coffee here, please?

00:13:09.144 --> 00:13:11.563
Do you make
the female teachers fetch coffee?

00:13:12.272 --> 00:13:14.608
Well, I feel like
I should offer you something.

00:13:15.275 --> 00:13:17.277
I'll get my own coffee.

00:13:58.276 --> 00:13:59.402
Beauty.

00:14:23.093 --> 00:14:24.094
Where are you?

00:14:25.345 --> 00:14:26.888
{\an8}I haven't heard from you lately.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:41.569
You've got a real knack
for getting on my nerves.

00:14:41.653 --> 00:14:43.279
Did I scare you?

00:14:43.863 --> 00:14:46.616
I've been calling you, but
you didn't hear me and kept texting.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.368
Do we have anything to talk about?

00:14:49.244 --> 00:14:50.745
Some of us are having tteokbokki,

00:14:51.538 --> 00:14:52.372
let's go together.

00:14:53.456 --> 00:14:55.291
What's she saying? Is she coming?

00:14:55.375 --> 00:14:56.584
Move your head, will you?

00:14:56.668 --> 00:14:57.585
I can't see!

00:14:57.669 --> 00:14:58.920
You move yours.

00:14:59.003 --> 00:15:00.797
Who gave you permission to cut in line?

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.758
She's leaving.

00:15:04.968 --> 00:15:07.512
- She's gone.
- I knew it.

00:15:07.595 --> 00:15:08.471
I told you.

00:15:17.063 --> 00:15:17.897
She said no?

00:15:18.982 --> 00:15:20.108
Geez.

00:15:21.151 --> 00:15:21.985
Hey.

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:24.195
You're a freshman. Why are you here?

00:15:24.279 --> 00:15:26.740
Without me,
who else would manage your fan club?

00:15:26.823 --> 00:15:29.951
I was hoping to eat with Choi Se-jin
for the first time.

00:15:30.618 --> 00:15:32.036
Why didn't she want to come?

00:15:35.039 --> 00:15:35.957
My existence.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.585
I prefer eating with someone I like.

00:15:39.586 --> 00:15:42.964
I don't want to ruin
my precious meal with your existence.

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:44.549
I hope you understand.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.718
Your existence?

00:15:48.344 --> 00:15:49.429
What did I tell you?

00:15:49.512 --> 00:15:52.056
It should've been
my existence there from the start.

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:54.142
Anyway, I think
she's the only girl in school

00:15:54.225 --> 00:15:55.435
who doesn't like you.

00:16:04.694 --> 00:16:06.196
Hey, your uncle's at school.

00:16:06.905 --> 00:16:08.031
What?

00:16:09.199 --> 00:16:12.660
Han-gyul, I overheard
what Hong Jung-pyo said to you earlier.

00:16:12.744 --> 00:16:15.580
I happened to mention
that your Filial Piety Award got canceled.

00:16:15.663 --> 00:16:16.790
Gosh, dang it.

00:16:17.373 --> 00:16:18.416
Han-gyul!

00:16:23.505 --> 00:16:25.965
How about a cigarette instead of coffee?

00:16:26.049 --> 00:16:27.759
Why don't we go by the wisterias

00:16:27.842 --> 00:16:30.011
and smoke a cigarette? Sound good?

00:16:30.845 --> 00:16:32.472
Are you seriously smoking at school?

00:16:32.555 --> 00:16:33.640
Sorry?

00:16:34.766 --> 00:16:37.018
What the hell?
Smoking where students study?

00:16:42.565 --> 00:16:43.608
Oh, my goodness.

00:16:46.444 --> 00:16:48.196
I was just joking.

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:52.158
Let me ask you something.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.995
How is the Filial Piety Award decided?

00:16:56.663 --> 00:16:58.289
Well, the thing is...

00:16:58.373 --> 00:17:01.167
I know Han-gyul is always
a respectful kid and a nephew,

00:17:01.251 --> 00:17:03.211
but by the usual definition,

00:17:03.294 --> 00:17:07.340
the award is meant for a child
and the parents who raised them.

00:17:07.423 --> 00:17:08.716
Pneumococcal vaccines.

00:17:09.467 --> 00:17:10.885
How many times do you get them?

00:17:10.969 --> 00:17:12.470
Pneumo...

00:17:13.096 --> 00:17:14.138
There are four shots.

00:17:14.764 --> 00:17:16.891
At two, four, six,

00:17:16.975 --> 00:17:18.184
and twelve months old.

00:17:21.104 --> 00:17:24.482
On September 30th, 2008,
Han-gyul had his third shot.

00:17:25.233 --> 00:17:26.860
After that shot, he ran a high fever.

00:17:26.943 --> 00:17:29.445
He burned up to 38.4 degrees Celsius.

00:17:29.529 --> 00:17:31.948
The pharmacy was closed,
and I had no one to call.

00:17:32.031 --> 00:17:33.575
I carried that tiny kid

00:17:33.658 --> 00:17:35.243
and ran the whole 5 km to the ER.

00:17:35.326 --> 00:17:37.495
That must've been tough.

00:17:37.579 --> 00:17:39.914
When my twins got
their pneumococcal shots...

00:17:43.334 --> 00:17:47.088
On December 28th, 2013,
Han-gyul lost his very first tooth.

00:17:47.672 --> 00:17:50.425
On October 19th, 2014,
he rode a bike for the first time.

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:53.678
His first day of elementary school
was March 2nd, 2015.

00:17:53.761 --> 00:17:56.055
March 4th, 2024,
was his first day of high school.

00:17:56.139 --> 00:18:00.184
You all remember he delivered
the entrance oath as student rep, right?

00:18:00.268 --> 00:18:01.185
Yes, sir.

00:18:05.189 --> 00:18:06.149
So, tell me.

00:18:06.232 --> 00:18:07.066
Sorry?

00:18:08.151 --> 00:18:09.944
If not me, who's Han-gyul's parent?

00:18:12.822 --> 00:18:14.490
Who else could it be?

00:18:15.116 --> 00:18:18.286
Is that what a gangster looks like
when he has logic?

00:18:40.224 --> 00:18:41.935
I can't believe he made that oath

00:18:42.018 --> 00:18:44.812
for this stupid school
that treats people unfairly.

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:51.319
You seem busy,
so I'll just leave it at that, okay?

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:13.633
I can't live like this.

00:19:14.217 --> 00:19:15.176
I just can't.

00:19:17.303 --> 00:19:19.097
Mr. Hong, he left.

00:19:19.681 --> 00:19:20.974
You can come out now.

00:19:26.354 --> 00:19:28.189
That fool won't quit running his mouth.

00:19:28.982 --> 00:19:30.608
I was aware Han-gyul

00:19:30.692 --> 00:19:32.902
was living with his uncle
after his parents passed.

00:19:33.486 --> 00:19:35.947
How can someone like him
be Han-gyul's uncle?

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:37.281
Is he maternal or paternal?

00:19:37.365 --> 00:19:39.742
Are they really related?
Do they have the same genes?

00:19:39.826 --> 00:19:41.369
What does he even do?

00:19:41.995 --> 00:19:44.706
Wow, you sure know how to talk.

00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:45.707
Tell me about it.

00:19:48.835 --> 00:19:50.378
What do you think he does?

00:19:51.421 --> 00:19:53.047
He's obviously a gangster.

00:19:56.175 --> 00:19:57.844
Let's go!

00:19:57.927 --> 00:19:59.512
Yes, boss!

00:20:08.104 --> 00:20:10.314
He's always surrounded by his gang,

00:20:10.398 --> 00:20:12.900
doing who knows what.

00:20:13.443 --> 00:20:15.236
What do you mean, "gangster"?

00:20:15.319 --> 00:20:16.571
He's just a thug.

00:20:17.989 --> 00:20:21.701
One time, I was drinking with some friends
at the local health center,

00:20:21.784 --> 00:20:23.536
and he suddenly stormed in.

00:20:27.206 --> 00:20:28.041
Why are you here?

00:20:33.755 --> 00:20:34.797
A whole goat?

00:20:36.507 --> 00:20:39.635
I checked it for my kid today,
but the color looked so thin.

00:20:39.719 --> 00:20:42.013
It only looks like half to me.

00:20:42.096 --> 00:20:43.681
Well, black goat tonic

00:20:43.765 --> 00:20:46.225
gets thicker or thinner
depending on the ingredients...

00:20:46.309 --> 00:20:48.686
If something rubs him the wrong way,
he smashes things.

00:20:49.312 --> 00:20:50.772
That's nothing.

00:20:52.273 --> 00:20:54.859
When we came back from hiking last time,

00:21:02.867 --> 00:21:05.995
he was digging away that night,

00:21:06.079 --> 00:21:09.749
sweating buckets
like he was burying a body.

00:21:19.884 --> 00:21:20.718
I saw him too.

00:21:22.678 --> 00:21:24.764
I saw my neighbor's car.

00:21:45.409 --> 00:21:47.203
He was lifting it up like this.

00:21:48.663 --> 00:21:50.706
He lifted the car?

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:52.583
- Yes.
- With his bare hands?

00:21:52.667 --> 00:21:53.626
Yes.

00:21:53.709 --> 00:21:54.836
Lifting a car is nothing.

00:21:54.919 --> 00:21:57.630
When he's mad,
he could even smash the whole world.

00:21:58.464 --> 00:22:00.925
I feel humiliated
that I was convinced by his logic

00:22:01.008 --> 00:22:02.301
even for a moment.

00:22:04.137 --> 00:22:07.348
I heard that Han-gyul lost his parents
when he was little

00:22:07.431 --> 00:22:09.142
and was raised by his uncle,

00:22:09.225 --> 00:22:11.477
never even knowing
what his parents looked like.

00:22:22.697 --> 00:22:24.574
- Is everything okay?
- Hey.

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:28.536
Does this look okay to you?

00:22:30.371 --> 00:22:33.666
He's got nothing better to do
than come and wreck school property?

00:22:33.749 --> 00:22:35.293
Tell him to stop coming to school!

00:22:35.793 --> 00:22:36.919
That's enough.

00:22:43.467 --> 00:22:45.845
I didn't tell my uncle
because I knew he'd overreact.

00:22:46.387 --> 00:22:47.221
I'm sorry.

00:22:47.305 --> 00:22:49.640
What needs to be done needs to be done.

00:22:51.726 --> 00:22:54.478
Once something's buried,
it's tough to dig it up later.

00:22:59.108 --> 00:23:01.527
Everything's fine, so don't worry.

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:27.011
READY-MADE CURRY

00:23:34.101 --> 00:23:36.604
Sweetheart, where are you?

00:23:37.563 --> 00:23:38.731
Is everything all right?

00:23:39.857 --> 00:23:43.236
I made your favorite chicken soup, Bom.

00:24:00.711 --> 00:24:01.629
{\an8}I wish

00:24:02.421 --> 00:24:05.007
{\an8}I could enjoy it with my daughter.

00:24:06.342 --> 00:24:07.218
{\an8}Whatever the reason,

00:24:07.969 --> 00:24:10.346
{\an8}I shouldn't have said that to you.

00:25:32.845 --> 00:25:34.597
{\an8}Ms. Seo, are you home?

00:25:35.097 --> 00:25:36.849
{\an8}I need a spare key.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.314
Yikes.

00:25:54.742 --> 00:25:56.327
What's wrong with the streetlights?

00:26:34.156 --> 00:26:34.990
It's that guy.

00:26:43.541 --> 00:26:45.084
What is that?

00:26:50.881 --> 00:26:52.341
What do you think he does?

00:26:52.425 --> 00:26:53.634
He's obviously a gangster.

00:26:53.717 --> 00:26:56.095
He was digging away that night,
sweating buckets...

00:26:56.178 --> 00:26:59.181
If something rubs him the wrong way,
he smashes things.

00:28:17.843 --> 00:28:19.678
Were you trying to call the cops?

00:28:22.473 --> 00:28:23.474
Please don't kill me.

00:28:23.557 --> 00:28:26.227
I can't die now.
There's too much left unresolved.

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:27.895
If I had to die, better in Seoul.

00:28:27.978 --> 00:28:29.563
At least I'd get a decent funeral.

00:28:29.647 --> 00:28:32.650
If I end up dying here
after cutting off my parents and friends,

00:28:32.733 --> 00:28:34.818
no one would come to my funeral.

00:28:35.861 --> 00:28:38.489
Plus, getting stabbed to death
on a country road?

00:28:38.572 --> 00:28:40.950
There would be
a lot of grim talk at the funeral.

00:28:42.743 --> 00:28:44.411
What do you mean, stabbed?

00:28:47.831 --> 00:28:49.416
- With this?
- Oh, no!

00:28:59.718 --> 00:29:01.095
A 30 cm spicy chicken skewer.

00:29:01.178 --> 00:29:03.264
Near the dental clinic
at Shinsu Intersection.

00:29:19.196 --> 00:29:21.198
I didn't know about your tastes.

00:29:21.282 --> 00:29:23.158
I had no idea you were
into chicken skewers.

00:29:23.242 --> 00:29:26.996
You were running down an empty street
at night with that in your tattooed arm.

00:29:35.504 --> 00:29:38.215
I got it as a gift from the gas station
since I'm a regular.

00:29:38.299 --> 00:29:40.467
One shouldn't throw away a gift.

00:29:43.596 --> 00:29:46.974
I just moved from Seoul,
so I'm not familiar with the area.

00:29:48.934 --> 00:29:50.311
Well then, take care.

00:29:53.856 --> 00:29:55.274
Is that your place?

00:29:57.234 --> 00:29:59.111
Go on inside. It's not safe outside.

00:30:00.904 --> 00:30:01.947
No.

00:30:02.031 --> 00:30:04.283
You go ahead. The door's kind of broken.

00:30:15.753 --> 00:30:18.172
I'll sort it out,
so please don't worry about it.

00:30:19.465 --> 00:30:20.507
No.

00:30:20.591 --> 00:30:22.176
This isn't my place, it's rented.

00:30:22.259 --> 00:30:23.761
I'd have to pay for the damage.

00:30:27.431 --> 00:30:28.807
No, don't do it.

00:30:42.905 --> 00:30:45.240
Wait, stop!

00:31:20.275 --> 00:31:22.486
I heard the sauce is what makes it good.

00:31:32.871 --> 00:31:34.331
I'm leaving

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:37.084
before this skewer gets cold.

00:31:38.961 --> 00:31:41.046
But you'll definitely

00:31:44.341 --> 00:31:46.176
pay for your mistake.

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.228
Crap, I'm late.

00:32:01.608 --> 00:32:03.026
ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE AWARD

00:32:05.487 --> 00:32:07.406
FILIAL PIETY AWARD

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:21.170
Is Uncle not back yet?

00:32:21.879 --> 00:32:23.297
He's not picking up again.

00:32:29.261 --> 00:32:32.097
- What took you so long?
- Did you get reported again?

00:32:32.931 --> 00:32:34.850
Here. I'm so hot.

00:32:36.643 --> 00:32:37.936
I don't need to eat it.

00:32:38.729 --> 00:32:41.064
Why'd you run to town
in the middle of the night?

00:32:42.983 --> 00:32:44.026
This is it.

00:32:44.109 --> 00:32:46.361
My favorite spicy chicken skewer.

00:32:47.446 --> 00:32:48.697
Thanks, Uncle.

00:32:50.449 --> 00:32:52.159
You like it that much?

00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.374
Boss,

00:32:59.458 --> 00:33:01.627
I'm pretty sure
there isn't a speck of dust.

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:04.046
You wiped it before going
to get the chicken skewer.

00:33:08.759 --> 00:33:10.385
"Filial Piety Award, Sun Han-gyul."

00:33:11.011 --> 00:33:13.722
"This student is hereby awarded
this certificate

00:33:13.806 --> 00:33:17.100
for exemplary filial piety and respect
for elders, serving as a role model

00:33:17.184 --> 00:33:18.602
for others."

00:33:20.938 --> 00:33:21.980
- Phillip.
- Yes?

00:33:22.523 --> 00:33:25.400
Out of all these awards,
this one's my favorite.

00:33:26.485 --> 00:33:27.778
Have I ever told you?

00:33:27.861 --> 00:33:30.739
Ever since he was a kid,
Han-gyul has won tons of awards.

00:33:31.323 --> 00:33:33.408
I used small awards
as trivets for hot bowls,

00:33:33.492 --> 00:33:34.326
and silver medals--

00:33:34.409 --> 00:33:36.912
"To prop up wobbly dressers."

00:33:37.913 --> 00:33:38.747
Have I told you?

00:33:38.831 --> 00:33:40.040
- Yes.
- Yeah.

00:33:40.123 --> 00:33:42.501
Sometimes you rephrase it to say

00:33:43.085 --> 00:33:46.463
they were used
for wobbly bookshelves or beds.

00:33:48.465 --> 00:33:50.175
What was your homeroom teacher's name?

00:33:50.259 --> 00:33:52.427
I told you, it's Yoon Bom.

00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:54.304
Yoon Bom.

00:33:54.972 --> 00:33:56.098
She's from Seoul, right?

00:33:57.307 --> 00:33:58.600
Uncle.

00:33:58.684 --> 00:34:01.895
Whoever my homeroom teacher is,
don't worry about school stuff.

00:34:01.979 --> 00:34:02.980
I'll manage it myself.

00:34:03.063 --> 00:34:06.108
When you tell me not to worry,
that's when I worry the most.

00:34:06.191 --> 00:34:09.361
A kid needs to act up sometimes
to make raising them worthwhile.

00:34:09.444 --> 00:34:11.405
If I didn't care about you at all,

00:34:11.488 --> 00:34:14.366
how could I even deserve these?

00:34:16.326 --> 00:34:17.452
Okay.

00:34:17.536 --> 00:34:19.955
From now on,
I'm going to say whatever I want

00:34:20.038 --> 00:34:21.415
and ask for whatever I want,

00:34:21.498 --> 00:34:22.624
so you have to say yes.

00:34:22.708 --> 00:34:24.710
Sure, whatever you want.

00:34:24.793 --> 00:34:26.712
I'd bury or stab anyone.

00:34:26.795 --> 00:34:29.131
Hell, I'd even kill if you said the word.

00:34:29.214 --> 00:34:30.841
Come on, Uncle!

00:34:30.924 --> 00:34:32.801
Eat that. I'll go take out the trash.

00:34:33.385 --> 00:34:34.761
Let's go, Phillip.

00:34:35.345 --> 00:34:36.179
Sure.

00:34:44.021 --> 00:34:45.230
Boss.

00:34:48.066 --> 00:34:49.192
Did someone report you?

00:34:49.985 --> 00:34:51.820
With that car damage incident before,

00:34:51.904 --> 00:34:53.196
you can't get reported again.

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.740
I didn't get reported,

00:34:55.949 --> 00:34:58.118
- but I got ignored.
- Ignored?

00:35:01.413 --> 00:35:03.040
She really didn't recognize me.

00:35:13.842 --> 00:35:16.219
Beauty.

00:35:20.807 --> 00:35:23.143
She made the mistake
of not recognizing me today.

00:35:23.727 --> 00:35:25.687
I'll make her pay for that somehow.

00:35:31.985 --> 00:35:33.946
What are you looking at?

00:35:34.571 --> 00:35:35.405
Phillip.

00:35:36.865 --> 00:35:38.158
Cherry blossoms have bloomed.

00:35:40.285 --> 00:35:41.411
I guess spring is here.

00:35:42.287 --> 00:35:43.956
You've never liked spring.

00:35:44.665 --> 00:35:47.167
You said nothing beats
the coolness of winter

00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:48.752
and spring just makes you itchy.

00:35:52.089 --> 00:35:52.965
Let's see

00:35:54.383 --> 00:35:55.550
if I start liking spring.

00:36:45.892 --> 00:36:47.477
PURE SPIRIT BRIGHT DREAMS
SHINSU HIGH

00:36:47.561 --> 00:36:49.146
MOTTO
SWEAT NOW, CRY LESS LATER

00:36:50.689 --> 00:36:52.149
- Hey.
- What?

00:36:52.858 --> 00:36:54.693
I'm sure you all know

00:36:54.776 --> 00:36:56.695
that parent-teacher conferences happen

00:36:56.778 --> 00:37:00.032
right after midterms, correct?

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:06.747
Dae-han and Min-guk,
with their parent in the staff room.

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:12.919
TOTAL SCORE, NUMBER OF STUDENTS, GRADE

00:37:14.046 --> 00:37:16.423
Se-jin, whose parent is the governor.

00:37:23.555 --> 00:37:26.933
And Han-gyul, whose guardian
is out for revenge.

00:37:31.021 --> 00:37:33.231
Ms. Yoon, is my little brother
in last place?

00:37:33.315 --> 00:37:35.817
We came out of the same womb,
why are you acting older?

00:37:35.901 --> 00:37:37.444
Who was last on the last mock test?

00:37:37.527 --> 00:37:38.612
Quiet.

00:37:41.656 --> 00:37:43.784
You all know
parent-teacher conferences start

00:37:43.867 --> 00:37:44.910
right after midterms?

00:37:44.993 --> 00:37:45.869
Yes, ma'am.

00:37:46.453 --> 00:37:48.955
I'll reach out to parents
to set up dates from today.

00:37:49.039 --> 00:37:49.915
Ms. Yoon.

00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:52.584
Parents don't have to attend, right?

00:37:53.752 --> 00:37:55.629
What are you talking about? They have to.

00:37:55.712 --> 00:37:58.090
But Han-gyul's parents aren't coming.

00:38:00.717 --> 00:38:01.885
That's because Han-gyul...

00:38:09.226 --> 00:38:11.394
Let's talk about this later, okay?

00:38:21.738 --> 00:38:22.739
Ms. Yoon.

00:38:23.323 --> 00:38:24.491
Please?

00:38:26.409 --> 00:38:28.120
It's not like you don't have parents.

00:38:28.203 --> 00:38:29.788
It's basically like not having them.

00:38:31.164 --> 00:38:32.624
As you know, my dad

00:38:32.707 --> 00:38:35.335
has got his hands full
with his re-election campaign.

00:38:35.836 --> 00:38:37.796
- What about your mom?
- She's even busier

00:38:37.879 --> 00:38:39.214
because of the campaign work.

00:38:40.924 --> 00:38:41.758
In that case,

00:38:43.385 --> 00:38:45.762
I'll adjust to your parents' schedule.

00:38:46.388 --> 00:38:47.514
All right?

00:38:48.515 --> 00:38:50.892
A daughter shouldn't stand
in the way of her parents.

00:38:56.231 --> 00:38:58.316
I'm sure you know what it's like

00:38:59.276 --> 00:39:01.319
to live under your parents' name.

00:39:06.366 --> 00:39:08.034
Push back the meeting by a few days.

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:14.833
No, that can't be.

00:39:15.709 --> 00:39:16.877
There's no way she'd know.

00:39:18.837 --> 00:39:21.673
Sure, I'll look up info
on art school applications

00:39:21.756 --> 00:39:23.300
and go over it during the meeting.

00:39:23.884 --> 00:39:26.303
Sure, 7:00 p.m. on Tuesday.

00:39:26.386 --> 00:39:28.430
I'll see you then. Thank you.

00:39:35.812 --> 00:39:39.024
{\an8}SUN HAN-GYUL, 2ND YEAR, CLASS 1, NO. 11
GUARDIAN: SUN JAE-GYU, UNCLE

00:39:39.107 --> 00:39:40.859
{\an8}You'll definitely

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:43.612
pay for your mistake.

00:39:49.659 --> 00:39:51.745
Try to schedule a meeting
with Han-gyul's uncle

00:39:51.828 --> 00:39:53.205
for the latest date possible.

00:39:53.288 --> 00:39:57.042
Keep dragging it out
and make it through the end of the week.

00:39:58.376 --> 00:39:59.711
No way.

00:40:00.295 --> 00:40:01.838
Ms. Bom would never do that.

00:40:01.922 --> 00:40:05.425
She's been in Seoul for six years
and has met all kinds of parents.

00:40:05.508 --> 00:40:07.594
Why would she be scared
to put off the meeting?

00:40:07.677 --> 00:40:08.511
Am I right?

00:40:09.554 --> 00:40:11.431
See? She said I'm right.

00:40:13.433 --> 00:40:14.935
Do you know what this is?

00:40:16.895 --> 00:40:19.397
This is the scar Sun Jae-gyu gave me.

00:40:20.523 --> 00:40:22.442
He slashed me
with a piece of glass this big!

00:40:24.152 --> 00:40:26.446
You just don't know what he's capable of.

00:40:27.072 --> 00:40:30.492
Last time, he let it slide
because the female teachers were watching.

00:40:30.575 --> 00:40:32.369
But meeting with him alone?

00:40:32.452 --> 00:40:35.747
Who knows what he'll do or how he'll turn?

00:40:36.748 --> 00:40:38.625
I'm staying out of this.
Handle it yourself.

00:40:38.708 --> 00:40:40.835
Even a lowlife wouldn't treat

00:40:40.919 --> 00:40:43.046
his nephew's homeroom teacher like that.

00:40:43.588 --> 00:40:45.799
And it's not like
Ms. Bom made a mistake with him

00:40:46.299 --> 00:40:47.926
the way someone else did.

00:40:48.009 --> 00:40:49.052
Here we go again.

00:40:51.054 --> 00:40:51.888
Listen.

00:40:52.472 --> 00:40:55.767
The more you delay this,
the harder it gets.

00:40:55.850 --> 00:40:57.811
Go on, pick up the phone.

00:40:58.478 --> 00:40:59.312
Fine, call him.

00:40:59.396 --> 00:41:01.690
He's likely picking on people
for money at a market.

00:41:08.196 --> 00:41:09.739
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

00:41:09.823 --> 00:41:10.657
Boss.

00:41:21.626 --> 00:41:23.086
Who's the owner here?

00:41:24.087 --> 00:41:26.047
You can't just show up like this.

00:41:26.131 --> 00:41:28.008
We talked on the phone already.

00:41:28.091 --> 00:41:30.176
I promised we'd pay you back next month.

00:41:30.802 --> 00:41:34.014
Ma'am, we're not that kind of people.

00:41:41.938 --> 00:41:42.856
Do you accept groups?

00:41:43.481 --> 00:41:44.524
Sorry?

00:41:44.607 --> 00:41:45.900
What's the current situation?

00:41:45.984 --> 00:41:47.610
How much tteokbokki is left here?

00:41:48.236 --> 00:41:49.904
Is there enough for all of us?

00:41:51.239 --> 00:41:53.074
Honey, no more customers today.

00:41:53.158 --> 00:41:54.159
Yes, we have enough.

00:41:54.242 --> 00:41:55.910
Have a seat.

00:41:56.828 --> 00:41:57.912
Let's take a seat.

00:41:57.996 --> 00:41:58.830
Yes, sir.

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:09.966
This is our first meal since last year's
pork bone soup place, right?

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:11.468
I haven't eaten since yesterday.

00:42:11.551 --> 00:42:13.386
I did an enema just so I could eat this.

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:15.138
Take your time picking.

00:42:15.221 --> 00:42:16.056
Yes, ma'am!

00:42:16.139 --> 00:42:17.891
Why do you keep following me?

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:26.649
Who's calling at lunchtime?

00:42:28.526 --> 00:42:30.195
Well, I'm...

00:42:31.071 --> 00:42:33.448
I'm Yoon Bom, Han-gyul's homeroom teacher.

00:42:33.531 --> 00:42:34.699
Hey.

00:42:37.202 --> 00:42:38.078
Is that so?

00:42:39.037 --> 00:42:40.121
Yes, it is.

00:42:40.747 --> 00:42:43.541
I'm calling to ask
when you'd be available

00:42:44.125 --> 00:42:47.420
for the parent-teacher conference.

00:42:47.504 --> 00:42:49.839
- I'm on my way now.
- Right now?

00:42:49.923 --> 00:42:51.299
He's coming now?

00:42:51.383 --> 00:42:53.176
Mr. Hong, Ms. Jeong, pack your bags.

00:42:53.259 --> 00:42:54.803
If I run, I'll get there soon.

00:42:54.886 --> 00:42:56.221
I can eat later.

00:42:58.223 --> 00:42:59.474
I'm scared. Let's get out.

00:42:59.557 --> 00:43:02.185
No, you can't come right now.

00:43:02.268 --> 00:43:05.897
I just called today to schedule a time.

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:07.065
I believe it's best

00:43:07.148 --> 00:43:09.526
if I go through what Han-gyul wrote first

00:43:09.609 --> 00:43:10.735
and have a meeting later.

00:43:11.486 --> 00:43:12.320
I'll have to wait.

00:43:19.577 --> 00:43:23.248
Yes, how about 4:00 p.m. next Monday?

00:43:24.958 --> 00:43:26.209
What do you like?

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:27.836
Sorry?

00:43:27.919 --> 00:43:29.796
If there's nothing, I'll bring whatever.

00:43:31.089 --> 00:43:33.633
Sure, I'll see you next Monday...

00:43:34.926 --> 00:43:35.885
Go ahead and order.

00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:41.724
Ms. Bom.

00:43:42.934 --> 00:43:44.102
Brace yourself.

00:43:44.644 --> 00:43:46.646
We're only halfway through the semester.

00:43:46.729 --> 00:43:49.482
To manage the whole year,
you've got to hold your ground.

00:43:49.566 --> 00:43:52.527
If you need anything, let me know anytime.

00:43:59.117 --> 00:44:01.828
Oh, my goodness. This is bad.

00:44:03.246 --> 00:44:04.164
So,

00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:09.085
you got caught trying
to report Han-gyul's uncle?

00:44:11.129 --> 00:44:12.297
I have to stay strong.

00:44:12.922 --> 00:44:15.842
If something happens at this school too,
I have nowhere to go.

00:44:15.925 --> 00:44:18.261
And now I've been told
I'll pay for my mistake.

00:44:19.179 --> 00:44:20.180
I knew it.

00:44:20.263 --> 00:44:23.224
You got into big trouble in Seoul
and came here, right?

00:44:23.725 --> 00:44:25.059
What kind of trouble was it?

00:44:27.228 --> 00:44:28.980
How should I deal with him?

00:44:29.647 --> 00:44:30.815
Is there a way I can win?

00:44:31.941 --> 00:44:33.818
Has anyone ever beaten him?

00:44:33.902 --> 00:44:36.154
Who in this town could ever beat him...

00:44:36.946 --> 00:44:38.031
- Yes, there is.
- Really?

00:44:38.114 --> 00:44:40.200
Yes, I've seen it once.

00:44:40.909 --> 00:44:42.911
Han-gyul's uncle didn't make a sound

00:44:42.994 --> 00:44:45.788
and completely froze
at that person's words.

00:44:49.042 --> 00:44:50.502
I'd like to meet that person.

00:44:55.006 --> 00:44:56.841
Wow, this is tasty.

00:45:01.679 --> 00:45:03.348
Someone here can beat him?

00:45:03.932 --> 00:45:06.059
Order first.
I'll have the spicy squid and pork.

00:45:06.768 --> 00:45:09.103
One spicy squid and pork
and a soft tofu stew, please.

00:45:09.187 --> 00:45:12.065
Please make the tofu stew mild,
and skip the green onions.

00:45:12.148 --> 00:45:14.317
And a smaller serving of rice--

00:45:15.235 --> 00:45:17.529
Are you seriously
out of your freaking mind?

00:45:17.612 --> 00:45:21.032
Don't test me,
I'll knock your teeth right out.

00:45:21.115 --> 00:45:23.201
I'm working my butt off,
and you pull that crap?

00:45:23.284 --> 00:45:24.911
I'll slam that stupid mouth shut.

00:45:25.703 --> 00:45:27.247
You take what you get.

00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:29.582
Some scrawny little thing
shows up, acting picky

00:45:29.666 --> 00:45:31.334
and demanding this and that? Please.

00:45:31.417 --> 00:45:34.295
I'll slap your cheeks off your face.

00:45:34.879 --> 00:45:36.130
I'm not serving you.

00:45:36.214 --> 00:45:37.882
Eat spicy squid and pork

00:45:37.966 --> 00:45:39.926
or stop yapping and get lost.

00:45:41.094 --> 00:45:42.220
Get lost.

00:45:43.221 --> 00:45:44.514
Two spicy squid and pork.

00:45:46.558 --> 00:45:47.767
Damn it, today's rough.

00:45:50.186 --> 00:45:52.272
Han-gyul's uncle couldn't have
soft tofu stew

00:45:52.355 --> 00:45:54.357
and had to eat spicy squid and pork.

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:56.901
You think you can do it? Give it a try.

00:45:58.611 --> 00:46:02.574
"Some scrawny little thing
shows up, acting picky

00:46:03.616 --> 00:46:05.243
and demanding this and that? Please."

00:46:05.743 --> 00:46:07.412
"I'll slam that stupid mouth shut."

00:46:08.204 --> 00:46:09.956
What the hell? Are you kidding me?

00:46:10.707 --> 00:46:13.334
How are you going to beat him
when you're this soft?

00:46:13.418 --> 00:46:15.712
I'm not built for this.
I don't think it'll work.

00:46:16.588 --> 00:46:18.631
Maybe we should try a different approach.

00:46:19.591 --> 00:46:20.508
Then, Ms. Bom.

00:46:21.551 --> 00:46:24.012
Let's go back to square one

00:46:24.095 --> 00:46:27.223
and revisit what it means to be a teacher.

00:46:29.517 --> 00:46:33.646
Right now, I'm thinking
of a true educator of our time.

00:46:34.397 --> 00:46:36.441
Someone who left
a lasting legacy in education,

00:46:36.524 --> 00:46:38.985
earned the nation's admiration,

00:46:39.068 --> 00:46:42.989
and carries an unmatched dignity
and presence.

00:46:46.284 --> 00:46:47.160
Who could that be...

00:46:48.661 --> 00:46:50.121
DAMAGED HAIR TREATMENT MASK

00:47:25.865 --> 00:47:28.159
Exactly, this is exactly
how you should look.

00:47:29.827 --> 00:47:33.998
Ms. Seo, this isn't
the approach I had in mind.

00:47:34.082 --> 00:47:37.877
I was thinking of something
more strategic, logical, and reasonable...

00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:38.795
Ms. Bom.

00:47:39.379 --> 00:47:42.590
This style commands such authority

00:47:42.674 --> 00:47:45.134
that even Gangnam parents
tremble in respect.

00:47:45.218 --> 00:47:47.136
Trust me on this one.

00:47:50.348 --> 00:47:51.724
- Is it too tight?
- Yes.

00:47:52.975 --> 00:47:53.810
Loosen it a bit.

00:47:55.395 --> 00:47:56.562
I don't think I can do it.

00:48:15.331 --> 00:48:16.833
{\an8}MEETING WITH HAN-GYUL'S UNCLE

00:48:18.042 --> 00:48:19.168
11TH GRADE

00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:43.401
Ms. Yoon, is today your birthday?

00:48:43.484 --> 00:48:46.154
You've always worn
bright black, dark black,

00:48:46.237 --> 00:48:48.072
dull black, or light black.

00:48:48.156 --> 00:48:49.615
Why are you dressed like that?

00:48:51.909 --> 00:48:53.911
There's a line in the Art of War by Wuzi.

00:48:54.829 --> 00:48:58.082
"Treat righteous forces with respect,

00:48:58.166 --> 00:49:00.042
and powerful forces with humility."

00:49:01.085 --> 00:49:04.380
In other words,
you treat honorable forces with respect,

00:49:05.047 --> 00:49:08.134
but when dealing with bullies
who think strength is everything,

00:49:09.969 --> 00:49:11.721
you start by lowering yourself.

00:49:14.432 --> 00:49:17.894
In other words, I chose to win by losing.

00:49:18.895 --> 00:49:20.646
Are you going off to a fight?

00:49:26.068 --> 00:49:28.362
Ethics and Philosophy, page 35.

00:49:28.446 --> 00:49:29.572
"Humanity is something

00:49:31.491 --> 00:49:32.408
that humans..."

00:49:38.915 --> 00:49:40.458
Good luck, Ms. Bom.

00:49:41.209 --> 00:49:43.002
- Sorry I have to go.
- Prepare yourself.

00:49:43.085 --> 00:49:44.879
Are you all leaving already?

00:49:45.505 --> 00:49:46.339
Ms. Seo!

00:49:46.422 --> 00:49:48.466
You've got this.

00:49:49.175 --> 00:49:50.551
Ms. Seo.

00:49:53.513 --> 00:49:56.098
Han-gyul, you heard
your uncle's coming today, right?

00:49:56.808 --> 00:49:57.642
Yes, I did.

00:49:57.725 --> 00:49:59.519
Then stay for a little while.

00:49:59.602 --> 00:50:01.813
You can go with your uncle
after the meeting.

00:50:03.606 --> 00:50:05.107
- Ms. Yoon.
- Yes?

00:50:05.191 --> 00:50:06.984
"What needs to be done needs to be done."

00:50:09.111 --> 00:50:09.946
Good luck.

00:50:10.738 --> 00:50:11.656
Wish me luck.

00:50:30.758 --> 00:50:32.093
I'm switching off my ego

00:50:32.718 --> 00:50:35.137
starting now.

00:50:37.473 --> 00:50:40.101
No matter what happens, stay polite.

00:50:41.269 --> 00:50:43.855
No matter what you hear, stay calm.

00:51:11.549 --> 00:51:13.134
SHINSU HIGH SCHOOL

00:51:23.895 --> 00:51:25.146
{\an8}NO RUNNING IN THE HALLWAY

00:51:27.815 --> 00:51:28.858
KEEP RIGHT

00:51:34.947 --> 00:51:37.158
SHINSU HIGH BULLETIN BOARD
BUILDING A SAFE SCHOOL

00:51:37.241 --> 00:51:38.367
NO SMOKING

00:51:51.505 --> 00:51:52.340
Hello?

00:51:52.882 --> 00:51:55.843
I'm busy at the moment, so keep it brief.

00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:57.637
{\an8}LAW FIRM SOOJUN

00:51:58.638 --> 00:51:59.764
Actress Jeong Nan-hee.

00:52:01.098 --> 00:52:02.642
I may be the head of your fan cafe,

00:52:02.725 --> 00:52:04.894
but are you going
to make me work this hard?

00:52:05.937 --> 00:52:06.854
You need help?

00:52:07.647 --> 00:52:09.315
Am I the kind of guy who helps anyone?

00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:12.109
One moment.

00:52:17.573 --> 00:52:18.616
Thank you.

00:52:23.454 --> 00:52:26.415
You do know I'm rude and selfish.

00:52:29.502 --> 00:52:30.586
Thank you.

00:52:33.214 --> 00:52:36.258
I'll meet you out of loyalty.

00:52:36.342 --> 00:52:37.426
Let's talk later.

00:52:37.927 --> 00:52:39.470
I'm hanging up. Bye.

00:52:40.096 --> 00:52:41.430
Attorney Choi.

00:52:42.807 --> 00:52:45.977
Mr. Choi, the plaintiff,
has submitted his complaint.

00:52:49.605 --> 00:52:51.857
You should've sued that jerk sooner.

00:52:51.941 --> 00:52:53.693
Why've you been holding off until now?

00:52:53.776 --> 00:52:55.778
There's assault, damages from theft,

00:52:55.861 --> 00:52:56.904
and breach of contract.

00:52:57.571 --> 00:52:58.489
Right.

00:52:58.572 --> 00:53:00.199
The defendant's address is unknown.

00:53:03.369 --> 00:53:06.831
If we submit it like this, the court will
order us to correct the address.

00:53:07.415 --> 00:53:10.710
Then we can check it at the local office.

00:53:10.793 --> 00:53:13.879
Then we can find out where he lives.

00:53:15.881 --> 00:53:18.718
Wait a minute. So are you saying
you filed the complaint

00:53:18.801 --> 00:53:21.762
to find out where he lives?

00:53:21.846 --> 00:53:22.680
Why?

00:53:24.557 --> 00:53:26.517
I really didn't want to use this tactic

00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:28.686
since it felt underhanded. But...

00:53:30.688 --> 00:53:34.191
I've been searching for ten years,
ever since I became a lawyer.

00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:37.028
I've gone everywhere I could think of

00:53:37.111 --> 00:53:39.613
and checked every place he might be.

00:53:51.792 --> 00:53:52.710
But he's nowhere.

00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:55.004
It's like

00:53:55.588 --> 00:53:58.674
he never even existed to begin with.

00:53:59.508 --> 00:54:02.094
There's no trace of him at all.

00:54:04.388 --> 00:54:06.599
That's weird.

00:54:07.183 --> 00:54:08.934
If he's still nowhere to be found,

00:54:09.518 --> 00:54:10.561
could he be dead?

00:54:13.189 --> 00:54:14.815
- No, he can't.
- No, he can't.

00:54:15.441 --> 00:54:17.485
Do you know why I'm always fully dressed

00:54:18.194 --> 00:54:19.695
in a wrinkle-free shirt,

00:54:19.779 --> 00:54:23.365
spotless dress shoes,
and a silk tie that screams success?

00:54:23.449 --> 00:54:24.909
Gosh, I know the answer.

00:54:25.409 --> 00:54:27.453
You never know where you'll meet a woman.

00:54:28.788 --> 00:54:31.540
Because I don't know
when and where I'll run into that jerk.

00:54:33.375 --> 00:54:36.003
I'll carve it into his memory.

00:54:36.754 --> 00:54:37.588
"Look."

00:54:37.671 --> 00:54:40.466
"Even after you're gone,
my life is brilliant."

00:54:41.634 --> 00:54:43.969
"Feel it. Your life turned out that way

00:54:44.595 --> 00:54:46.430
because you betrayed me."

00:54:47.306 --> 00:54:48.140
You know what?

00:54:49.308 --> 00:54:50.476
I just saw in your eyes

00:54:50.559 --> 00:54:52.478
a kind of madness that comes with success.

00:54:54.563 --> 00:54:55.523
He has to

00:54:56.649 --> 00:54:57.483
see it too.

00:54:59.110 --> 00:55:01.070
He picked the wrong person to mess with.

00:55:02.446 --> 00:55:03.906
{\an8}PLAINTIFF CHOI I-JUN

00:55:03.989 --> 00:55:06.784
DEFENDANT SUN JAE-GYU
ADDRESS UNAVAILABLE

00:55:08.327 --> 00:55:11.205
So please be alive, Sun Jae-gyu.

00:55:12.706 --> 00:55:13.833
Wait until

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.168
I find you.

00:55:25.719 --> 00:55:26.971
SUN JAE-GYU

00:55:47.199 --> 00:55:48.617
It's great to meet you properly.

00:55:48.701 --> 00:55:50.327
I'm Yoon Bom, Han-gyul's teacher.

00:55:50.953 --> 00:55:51.996
Hi. Here.

00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:56.417
Sorry, but I'm not allowed
to accept gifts.

00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:58.294
It's not a gift, it's compensation.

00:55:58.377 --> 00:56:00.254
The staff room plant broke because of me.

00:56:00.337 --> 00:56:01.172
I see.

00:56:02.131 --> 00:56:03.132
No way.

00:56:03.215 --> 00:56:04.925
Your hands could break too.

00:56:07.595 --> 00:56:08.971
Over there.

00:56:09.555 --> 00:56:11.432
- Please put it down over there.
- Sure.

00:56:16.395 --> 00:56:17.980
MAY SHINSU HIGH SCHOOL BECOME RICH

00:56:21.942 --> 00:56:23.694
- Please have a seat.
- Sure.

00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:31.994
It's too small.

00:56:35.831 --> 00:56:38.000
Let's start the meeting.

00:56:40.544 --> 00:56:42.504
We should do this face-to-face.

00:56:42.588 --> 00:56:43.797
No, that's not necessary.

00:56:46.759 --> 00:56:48.219
Well...

00:56:49.094 --> 00:56:50.888
I saw the counseling form, and it says

00:56:52.014 --> 00:56:53.891
Han-gyul doesn't plan on going to college.

00:56:53.974 --> 00:56:55.100
You're from Seoul, right?

00:56:56.227 --> 00:56:57.561
I'm half Seoul-born.

00:56:59.230 --> 00:57:00.397
- Half?
- Yes.

00:57:01.106 --> 00:57:03.150
My mom's from Seoul.

00:57:03.234 --> 00:57:05.986
I grew up hearing the Seoul dialect,
so I can speak it well.

00:57:06.070 --> 00:57:07.238
I see.

00:57:09.657 --> 00:57:12.034
Hi, I'm Sun Jae-gyu.

00:57:12.576 --> 00:57:14.620
Do you want to be my friend?

00:57:17.248 --> 00:57:19.959
I sound like someone
straight from Seoul, right?

00:57:20.042 --> 00:57:21.961
I speak two languages, bilingual.

00:57:24.755 --> 00:57:25.756
I see.

00:57:28.550 --> 00:57:30.261
But in my opinion,

00:57:30.344 --> 00:57:33.806
given his grades, I just can't understand
why he wouldn't go to college.

00:57:33.889 --> 00:57:36.684
If he's not interested in college,
finishing high school will do.

00:57:37.977 --> 00:57:42.064
As you know, our school's college
admission rate wasn't great last year,

00:57:42.147 --> 00:57:44.942
and the school
has high expectations for Han-gyul.

00:57:45.025 --> 00:57:46.568
He knows what to do about that.

00:57:47.236 --> 00:57:49.154
How's he with his friends?

00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:51.407
Does he respect the teachers?

00:57:51.490 --> 00:57:53.409
No doubt about it.

00:57:53.492 --> 00:57:55.369
His friends and younger students
follow him,

00:57:56.078 --> 00:57:57.955
and the girls follow him
a little too much.

00:57:59.123 --> 00:58:00.332
That's great.

00:58:00.416 --> 00:58:02.042
That's all I needed to hear.

00:58:02.126 --> 00:58:02.960
So,

00:58:03.585 --> 00:58:06.255
let's focus on academics
rather than his social interactions.

00:58:06.338 --> 00:58:07.214
How old are you?

00:58:11.677 --> 00:58:13.679
You keep asking personal questions.

00:58:13.762 --> 00:58:15.848
In a parent-teacher meeting,
that kind of...

00:58:15.931 --> 00:58:16.807
Last name, Yoon?

00:58:18.350 --> 00:58:19.268
A one-syllable name?

00:58:20.561 --> 00:58:22.688
Yoon is your last name,
and Bom is your first?

00:58:23.314 --> 00:58:24.148
Yes.

00:58:33.324 --> 00:58:35.951
If you look
at Han-gyul's report card, his grades...

00:58:37.119 --> 00:58:39.288
His grades...

00:58:40.039 --> 00:58:40.998
Here, his grades...

00:58:48.589 --> 00:58:49.840
Bom.

00:59:38.263 --> 00:59:39.306
{\an8}Boss!

00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:42.226
{\an8}Who eats tofu outside a police station
this early in the morning?

00:59:42.851 --> 00:59:44.144
{\an8}What a killer view.

00:59:44.228 --> 00:59:45.938
{\an8}Why are you peeking at me?

00:59:46.021 --> 00:59:46.939
{\an8}I'm busted.

00:59:47.022 --> 00:59:48.148
{\an8}Wanna go watch a movie?

00:59:48.232 --> 00:59:49.900
{\an8}You're dying to have coffee with me.

00:59:50.692 --> 00:59:52.069
{\an8}Exchange teacher? What's that?

00:59:52.152 --> 00:59:53.529
{\an8}She's going back to Seoul.

00:59:53.612 --> 00:59:55.030
{\an8}What? When? Why?

00:59:56.824 --> 00:59:58.325
{\an8}Where's Han-gyul?

00:59:58.951 --> 01:00:00.494
{\an8}-Seoul.
- Are you sure he's here?

01:00:00.577 --> 01:00:02.913
I'm on my way. Wait right there.

01:00:10.045 --> 01:00:12.047
