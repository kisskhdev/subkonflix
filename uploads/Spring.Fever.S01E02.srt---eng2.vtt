WEBVTT

00:01:11.051 --> 00:01:12.136
Bom.

00:01:20.269 --> 00:01:22.229
What did you just say?

00:01:23.856 --> 00:01:25.316
-Bom.
-"Bom"?

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:27.484
Isn't that how your friends call you?

00:01:28.193 --> 00:01:29.403
"Bom."

00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:45.586
EPISODE 2

00:01:47.922 --> 00:01:48.923
Hey.

00:01:53.302 --> 00:01:54.970
We're not exactly on speaking terms.

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:58.015
You know what?

00:01:59.475 --> 00:02:03.062
When you're in a rush,
you just spew out words without thinking.

00:02:03.145 --> 00:02:05.397
But Han-gyul's parents aren't coming.

00:02:05.481 --> 00:02:06.523
That's because...

00:02:09.318 --> 00:02:11.236
I'm sorry about last time.

00:02:15.282 --> 00:02:17.368
-Give me your phone.
-What?

00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:27.795
From now on, if you have a problem,
talk to me directly.

00:02:28.504 --> 00:02:30.381
If you do that in front of others,

00:02:31.256 --> 00:02:32.758
it'll put them in a fix.

00:02:42.226 --> 00:02:43.769
I'd rather he cussed me out.

00:02:44.645 --> 00:02:46.981
He keeps acting cool. Geez.

00:02:49.984 --> 00:02:51.694
Sun Han-gyul.

00:02:52.444 --> 00:02:53.362
No.

00:02:54.071 --> 00:02:55.656
Evil Han-gyul.

00:03:03.497 --> 00:03:05.040
Now, sophists

00:03:05.124 --> 00:03:07.710
posit that there are
no universal moral standards,

00:03:07.793 --> 00:03:10.254
in other words, moral relativism.

00:03:10.337 --> 00:03:11.380
On the other hand,

00:03:11.463 --> 00:03:14.591
someone claimed there are
absolute, universal moral principles.

00:03:15.426 --> 00:03:17.511
-Who is it?
-Sun Jae-gyu!

00:03:19.138 --> 00:03:21.932
Ma'am, could you please
move this "Sun Jae-gyu" away?

00:03:22.016 --> 00:03:24.226
I can't see anything on the board

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:26.145
because of this darn pot.

00:03:26.228 --> 00:03:29.648
No way. Thanks to this "Sun Jae-gyu,"
I can't see your face,

00:03:29.732 --> 00:03:31.108
and my eyes feel so happy.

00:03:32.735 --> 00:03:33.652
Quiet.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.823
But how do you know the name
of the person who gave this?

00:03:43.245 --> 00:03:44.788
SUN JAE-GYU

00:04:06.143 --> 00:04:07.144
What the heck?

00:04:07.895 --> 00:04:11.106
-One, two.
-One, two.

00:04:12.191 --> 00:04:14.777
This isn't a gift.
It's more like a punishment.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.154
Sir, can't we just keep it at school?

00:04:17.237 --> 00:04:18.238
We can't.

00:04:18.781 --> 00:04:20.949
I love little, cute things.

00:04:21.492 --> 00:04:26.246
Come on. The bus stop is right over there,
so let's hang in there.

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:41.887
Hello, everyone.

00:04:42.471 --> 00:04:45.015
I'm sorry,
but could you take this pot back?

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:48.936
We don't know what to do with it,
and it's so heavy that the teachers…

00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:55.025
Is he even human?

00:05:04.368 --> 00:05:05.244
Get in.

00:05:07.871 --> 00:05:10.165
You can't just throw out a gift.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.900
-Why are you peeking at me?
-Am I busted?

00:05:37.734 --> 00:05:39.444
-I wasn't.
-You were.

00:05:39.528 --> 00:05:40.529
I'm busted.

00:05:42.739 --> 00:05:43.991
I did look...

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.368
but I was looking at the GPS.

00:05:46.994 --> 00:05:48.495
I thought you remembered me.

00:05:49.163 --> 00:05:50.247
Remember you?

00:05:50.747 --> 00:05:52.040
Haven't we met somewhere?

00:05:52.124 --> 00:05:53.041
We haven't.

00:05:53.125 --> 00:05:54.960
-I'm sure we have.
-I don't think so.

00:05:55.043 --> 00:05:56.503
Then I must be mistaken.

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:59.715
Where on earth have we met?

00:06:00.382 --> 00:06:02.801
There's no way
we were romantically involved.

00:06:03.844 --> 00:06:05.596
Did I take out a private loan?

00:06:06.221 --> 00:06:07.389
Did I get kidnapped?

00:06:07.973 --> 00:06:09.600
Or did I get robbed by him?

00:06:09.683 --> 00:06:10.601
What is it?

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.645
Do you want to remember me so badly?

00:06:16.023 --> 00:06:18.609
I tried to remember you because you asked.

00:06:18.692 --> 00:06:20.986
It's not like I want to remember you.

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:22.112
Mr. Sun Jae-gyu.

00:06:24.823 --> 00:06:25.949
What did you just say?

00:06:27.618 --> 00:06:28.452
What?

00:06:28.535 --> 00:06:30.120
You just said my name.

00:06:31.288 --> 00:06:33.415
-"Mr. Sun Jae-gyu"?
-Yes, Ms. Bom.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.420
Let's call each other by our names now.

00:07:03.278 --> 00:07:04.738
-Over there.
-Okay.

00:07:13.705 --> 00:07:15.332
SUN JAE-GYU

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.293
Why do you show your name?

00:07:21.004 --> 00:07:22.506
Do you have a problem with it?

00:07:23.131 --> 00:07:24.716
I know your name,

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.427
so you don't have to keep reminding me--

00:07:27.511 --> 00:07:31.640
Now that you know my name,
make sure to use it.

00:07:33.392 --> 00:07:36.395
Gosh, what a killer view you've got here.

00:07:36.478 --> 00:07:37.521
An ocean view.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:04.172
Stop looking, Bom.

00:08:04.256 --> 00:08:06.717
Why do you keep checking him out?

00:08:08.302 --> 00:08:10.762
Can I get a cup of coffee? Iced coffee.

00:08:13.056 --> 00:08:15.600
I carried it all the way here,
and I don't get coffee?

00:08:17.102 --> 00:08:19.146
Is this how
Seoul people treat their guests?

00:08:20.022 --> 00:08:23.191
I'm sorry,
but I happen to be out of coffee.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:25.110
Then let's do it next time.

00:08:25.193 --> 00:08:26.695
Sure, next time.

00:08:26.778 --> 00:08:28.071
When are you free?

00:08:30.115 --> 00:08:32.409
On second thought, now would be better.

00:08:35.245 --> 00:08:37.414
You must be dying to have coffee with me.

00:08:37.497 --> 00:08:38.623
Right?

00:08:38.707 --> 00:08:40.042
Okay. I got it.

00:08:45.881 --> 00:08:47.382
What? Is he leaving?

00:08:49.551 --> 00:08:51.261
He's so weird, seriously.

00:08:59.728 --> 00:09:01.104
TEACHER HONG JUNG-PYO

00:09:01.188 --> 00:09:02.314
Hey, Ms. Bom.

00:09:03.023 --> 00:09:05.942
You know the environmental club
I'm in charge of, right?

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:09.613
I'm thinking of
putting you in charge of that.

00:09:10.364 --> 00:09:13.367
But you're the science teacher,
so why should I?

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.495
Well, I know I'm in charge of science,

00:09:16.578 --> 00:09:19.039
but I'm overloaded
with head teacher duties.

00:09:19.122 --> 00:09:22.084
The principal also approved it,
so that's that.

00:09:22.167 --> 00:09:23.085
Bye, then.

00:09:23.168 --> 00:09:24.378
Wait. Mr. Hong!

00:09:25.003 --> 00:09:25.962
Hey!

00:09:28.298 --> 00:09:31.426
Since I've been quiet,
he must think I'm a pushover.

00:09:32.386 --> 00:09:36.431
I don't know anything about green energy.
How can I be in charge of it?

00:09:39.309 --> 00:09:40.185
Hello?

00:09:40.811 --> 00:09:41.686
Bom?

00:09:45.023 --> 00:09:46.358
You answered my call.

00:09:47.526 --> 00:09:50.320
Bom, can you at least hear me out?

00:09:50.821 --> 00:09:53.907
I regretted so much
after you left like that.

00:09:55.575 --> 00:09:56.827
Whatever the reason,

00:09:58.453 --> 00:10:00.956
I shouldn't have said that to you
as a father.

00:10:01.957 --> 00:10:02.874
Bom.

00:10:03.917 --> 00:10:07.170
Can you tell me where you are
so I can come explain myself?

00:10:08.004 --> 00:10:10.048
I miss you so much, my daughter.

00:10:10.715 --> 00:10:11.925
And I love you so much.

00:10:13.051 --> 00:10:15.345
Bom, are you listening?

00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:17.514
Bom.

00:10:29.234 --> 00:10:30.193
Who is it?

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.873
You said you were out of coffee. Take it.

00:10:45.041 --> 00:10:46.501
You really didn't have to…

00:10:49.754 --> 00:10:51.506
INSTANT COFFEE MIX

00:10:52.132 --> 00:10:53.592
Were you crying?

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.151
When you feel down,
sweets are the best cure.

00:11:18.241 --> 00:11:19.367
Bye, then.

00:11:27.167 --> 00:11:29.878
When you feel down,
sweets are the best cure.

00:11:32.464 --> 00:11:34.132
I've heard this voice before.

00:11:36.343 --> 00:11:37.719
ACTRESS JEONG NAN-HEE
GREENROOM

00:11:46.603 --> 00:11:47.812
Jerk.

00:11:47.896 --> 00:11:51.233
After you made a fancafe for me
and made it flourish…

00:11:52.567 --> 00:11:54.069
How could your love ever change?

00:11:55.987 --> 00:11:56.988
Change?

00:11:57.072 --> 00:11:57.989
If I could,

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:01.576
I'd freeze you from back then
and keep you for myself.

00:12:03.078 --> 00:12:06.373
But you can't do me a favor
and find someone for me?

00:12:08.333 --> 00:12:09.251
Ms. Jeong Nan-hee.

00:12:09.334 --> 00:12:12.254
As the founding president
of The Chronicles of Nan-hee,

00:12:12.337 --> 00:12:14.881
I'd run to you even at night
if you call me,

00:12:15.674 --> 00:12:17.175
but I'm not a detective.

00:12:17.884 --> 00:12:20.178
You said you know how to find people.

00:12:20.262 --> 00:12:23.181
You yourself are looking
for your archenemy or something.

00:12:24.766 --> 00:12:26.935
Are you trying to get me disbarred?

00:12:29.062 --> 00:12:33.191
I'm asking this favor
at the risk of losing you, my biggest fan.

00:12:38.655 --> 00:12:39.656
Who is it?

00:12:43.285 --> 00:12:44.494
Who are you looking for?

00:12:48.498 --> 00:12:49.708
My daughter.

00:12:52.335 --> 00:12:53.253
Your daughter?

00:12:56.131 --> 00:12:58.425
THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF HER DEBUT

00:12:58.508 --> 00:13:01.094
2022 FAN MEETING IN SEOUL
JEONG NAN-HEE

00:13:06.474 --> 00:13:07.559
Mom.

00:13:11.021 --> 00:13:11.938
You know.

00:13:14.232 --> 00:13:16.067
You've seen her once.

00:13:18.153 --> 00:13:21.031
You said she looked just like me
when I debuted.

00:13:24.367 --> 00:13:26.119
-Right?
-Well…

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:29.372
But she's not a kid.

00:13:29.873 --> 00:13:31.458
Where did she go?

00:13:31.541 --> 00:13:34.252
I'm asking you to find her
because I don't know.

00:13:35.086 --> 00:13:38.089
I don't know who she takes after,
but she's so hot-tempered.

00:13:38.757 --> 00:13:40.175
I said something harsh,

00:13:40.258 --> 00:13:42.886
and she disappeared.
I haven't heard from her ever since.

00:13:42.969 --> 00:13:44.638
What on earth did you say?

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:50.060
Just find her.

00:13:50.644 --> 00:13:52.687
If you don't, I'll unfollow you

00:13:52.771 --> 00:13:54.564
and take revenge on you.

00:13:58.151 --> 00:13:59.235
Yes, Secretary Oh.

00:14:03.281 --> 00:14:04.616
If you don't find her,

00:14:04.699 --> 00:14:07.619
I'll replace you as the fancafe president.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:10.997
Yes.

00:14:12.123 --> 00:14:13.416
Brat.

00:14:14.417 --> 00:14:16.002
Gosh, what do we do?

00:14:16.086 --> 00:14:18.046
The court hasn't ordered to correct it.

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:21.257
Geez. I thought
I'd be able to go find him today,

00:14:22.008 --> 00:14:25.387
so I washed my car twice
and even got my hair done in Cheongdam.

00:14:26.054 --> 00:14:28.973
I'm sure we'll get it by Monday,
so let's wait.

00:14:29.057 --> 00:14:31.935
Then we will find out
if Sun Jae-gyu is alive

00:14:32.519 --> 00:14:34.896
and where he lives.

00:14:39.359 --> 00:14:41.319
How have you been, guys?

00:14:41.403 --> 00:14:42.404
Hey, Officer Lee.

00:14:43.697 --> 00:14:44.989
Goodness.

00:14:45.073 --> 00:14:46.700
You've rearranged the desks.

00:14:47.492 --> 00:14:49.327
And changed the posters.

00:14:50.245 --> 00:14:52.622
And these new LED lights
are nice and bright.

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:55.333
Where did the pot go?

00:14:55.917 --> 00:14:56.960
Is it dead again?

00:14:57.919 --> 00:15:00.880
I told you,
you shouldn't water stuckyi often.

00:15:00.964 --> 00:15:02.215
Enough. Take a seat.

00:15:07.345 --> 00:15:08.555
Name.

00:15:08.638 --> 00:15:10.181
Sun Jae-gyu.

00:15:10.265 --> 00:15:11.099
Age.

00:15:11.683 --> 00:15:12.934
Thirty-six.

00:15:15.103 --> 00:15:16.980
You know why you're here, right?

00:15:17.063 --> 00:15:19.357
Yes, I know very well.

00:15:21.526 --> 00:15:22.694
Why did you touch it?

00:15:23.445 --> 00:15:24.571
Geez.

00:15:25.071 --> 00:15:25.989
Listen.

00:15:26.614 --> 00:15:28.491
I didn't really mean to touch it.

00:15:28.575 --> 00:15:32.787
-I had no choice--
-You see, there are a lot of witnesses.

00:15:34.622 --> 00:15:37.834
Sir, why don't we have a snack
before we keep going?

00:15:38.334 --> 00:15:39.335
Good?

00:15:43.715 --> 00:15:46.551
When you feel down,
sweets are the best cure.

00:15:47.135 --> 00:15:47.969
Come on.

00:15:55.769 --> 00:15:56.644
Try it.

00:15:57.228 --> 00:15:58.396
It's so sweet.

00:16:12.577 --> 00:16:14.996
When you feel down,
sweets are the best cure.

00:16:15.789 --> 00:16:17.832
I've definitely heard that before.

00:16:21.711 --> 00:16:23.922
SOLVING THE ENERGY CRISIS
ENERGY REVOLUTION

00:16:30.553 --> 00:16:31.679
I've heard it before.

00:16:37.352 --> 00:16:39.938
What's going on? Was there a gang fight?

00:16:40.021 --> 00:16:41.397
He's coming out!

00:16:41.481 --> 00:16:42.816
In your positions!

00:16:45.485 --> 00:16:46.361
Goodness.

00:16:48.988 --> 00:16:49.864
Welcome back!

00:16:49.948 --> 00:16:50.990
-Boss!
-Boss!

00:16:53.201 --> 00:16:55.203
Boss. First…

00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:57.789
Have some of this.

00:17:02.252 --> 00:17:04.420
Oh, my goodness.

00:17:04.504 --> 00:17:05.713
What on earth does he do

00:17:05.797 --> 00:17:08.716
to eat tofu outside a police station
this early in the morning?

00:17:18.643 --> 00:17:21.104
If petroleum disappears all of a sudden,

00:17:21.187 --> 00:17:22.856
what will happen to the world?

00:17:22.939 --> 00:17:26.025
Most of our cars, planes, and trains

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:27.652
will stop running.

00:17:27.735 --> 00:17:29.487
Shops will be empty,

00:17:29.571 --> 00:17:32.115
and there will be nothing left
for us to buy.

00:17:32.198 --> 00:17:37.495
Most of the machines that make ballpoint
pens, bags, plates, and appliances

00:17:37.579 --> 00:17:39.789
run on petroleum products.

00:17:39.873 --> 00:17:43.960
In fact, fossil fuel reserves
are finite and limited.

00:17:44.043 --> 00:17:46.296
And we don't know when they will run out.

00:17:46.379 --> 00:17:48.298
Let's not even try to remember.

00:17:48.882 --> 00:17:51.342
Wherever I saw him,
it couldn't have been good.

00:17:52.302 --> 00:17:55.221
We have learned
about sustainable, eco-friendly energy,

00:17:55.305 --> 00:17:57.056
new renewable energy.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:58.433
ENERGY CLUB
GREEN NARAE

00:17:59.809 --> 00:18:03.563
We have roughly gone through
energy types and functions first.

00:18:03.646 --> 00:18:04.522
Ma'am.

00:18:05.273 --> 00:18:07.609
Are we going to stay
in the classroom all the time?

00:18:08.192 --> 00:18:10.653
I hear the drone club goes on field trips.

00:18:11.738 --> 00:18:13.197
Field trips, my foot.

00:18:13.281 --> 00:18:15.491
What? You don't like field trips?

00:18:16.367 --> 00:18:17.619
It's not that.

00:18:18.661 --> 00:18:20.246
She's an exchange teacher.

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:23.166
I doubt she's passionate enough
to do that for a club.

00:18:24.083 --> 00:18:25.001
Exchange teacher?

00:18:25.627 --> 00:18:27.754
Then are you going back to Seoul?

00:18:27.837 --> 00:18:28.963
When?

00:18:30.465 --> 00:18:33.927
Regardless of when I go back,
while I'm here, I'm your club advisor

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:36.721
and will do my best to guide you, so…

00:18:36.804 --> 00:18:37.639
Ma'am.

00:18:38.932 --> 00:18:42.060
There's a power plant I know.
Can we go on a field trip there?

00:18:42.894 --> 00:18:44.687
You know a power plant?

00:18:45.271 --> 00:18:47.148
My uncle works at the power plant.

00:18:49.609 --> 00:18:51.569
Your uncle has a job?

00:18:58.076 --> 00:18:59.827
Yes, he does.

00:19:02.497 --> 00:19:05.541
Well, I mean,
he always goes around during the day

00:19:05.625 --> 00:19:07.251
and hangs with scary-looking guys.

00:19:07.335 --> 00:19:09.212
And I saw him
in front of a police station.

00:19:09.295 --> 00:19:11.673
Plus, I thought
he liked spicy chicken skewers,

00:19:11.756 --> 00:19:13.132
but he enjoys tofu too.

00:19:14.926 --> 00:19:16.386
Which power plant?

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:18.554
The one you see on Bus 23.

00:19:19.472 --> 00:19:21.891
The one with pinwheels
that look pretty at sunset?

00:19:21.975 --> 00:19:23.101
Let's go there, then.

00:19:23.184 --> 00:19:24.769
I've wanted to visit that place.

00:19:28.064 --> 00:19:29.482
Well… No.

00:19:29.565 --> 00:19:31.776
I'll look into another power plant.

00:19:32.568 --> 00:19:34.445
Now, "new renewable energy"

00:19:35.613 --> 00:19:39.200
is a combination of the words
"new energy" and "renewable energy."

00:19:39.784 --> 00:19:43.496
You all know that fossil fuels cause
environmental damage, right?

00:19:44.122 --> 00:19:48.167
To prevent that,
existing fossil fuels are reused

00:19:48.251 --> 00:19:50.253
or converted to renewable energy

00:19:50.336 --> 00:19:52.630
to make it eco-friendly energy.

00:19:52.714 --> 00:19:56.259
And there are various types
such as solar, wind and biomass.

00:20:01.973 --> 00:20:04.225
Hey, don't push. Darn it.

00:20:04.308 --> 00:20:05.268
Can you go faster?

00:20:39.761 --> 00:20:40.845
Give it to me.

00:20:45.933 --> 00:20:48.936
Goodness. When are we going
to finish at this rate? Move.

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.272
No, hold on. Stop.

00:20:51.355 --> 00:20:52.190
Boss.

00:20:52.774 --> 00:20:57.070
Should I explain to you what caused
the Donghak Peasant Revolution?

00:20:58.321 --> 00:21:01.908
I know you don't smoke,
but go take a smoke break, please.

00:21:03.076 --> 00:21:03.993
Fine.

00:21:04.994 --> 00:21:06.537
This will do, right?

00:21:14.962 --> 00:21:15.880
Hey.

00:21:15.963 --> 00:21:18.091
Black Belt, this is White.

00:21:18.174 --> 00:21:19.967
Are you free to talk?

00:21:22.386 --> 00:21:23.221
What?

00:21:26.432 --> 00:21:27.433
Got it.

00:21:28.017 --> 00:21:30.311
Wrap it up without me. I'll be back.

00:21:31.187 --> 00:21:32.021
Sorry?

00:21:41.656 --> 00:21:42.532
You scared me.

00:21:44.033 --> 00:21:46.661
Did you oppose
Green Narae visiting my workplace?

00:21:47.328 --> 00:21:48.955
Do you have CCTV cameras in school?

00:21:49.038 --> 00:21:51.749
How do you know what happened
in school 145 minutes ago?

00:21:52.291 --> 00:21:54.794
Give me a justifiable reason
why my company's out.

00:21:55.378 --> 00:21:56.838
I can't let him get to me.

00:21:56.921 --> 00:21:59.465
It's up to the teacher
to choose the place. Bye.

00:21:59.549 --> 00:22:01.551
If you leave my company out,

00:22:01.634 --> 00:22:04.387
Palryongpo Suho Energy is 27 km away,

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:06.973
and Seomigot Doseong Solar is 35 km away.

00:22:07.056 --> 00:22:09.058
It's not like the school has a car.

00:22:09.142 --> 00:22:11.352
How will you take the kids to one of them?

00:22:12.937 --> 00:22:16.732
But there's no justifiable reason
why we should go to your company either.

00:22:17.233 --> 00:22:18.109
There is.

00:22:18.693 --> 00:22:19.527
What is it?

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:23.489
They refused to give Han-gyul
the Filial Piety Award.

00:22:24.073 --> 00:22:25.158
But I'm his parent.

00:22:25.241 --> 00:22:27.743
I'd like to use this chance
to show his friends

00:22:27.827 --> 00:22:29.704
how his uncle works.

00:22:29.787 --> 00:22:32.456
I can't let him get to me, but…

00:22:37.295 --> 00:22:38.629
I'll think about it.

00:22:39.255 --> 00:22:41.382
If you're not sure about my company...

00:22:42.925 --> 00:22:44.635
we can go check it out this weekend.

00:22:44.719 --> 00:22:47.180
-Just you and me?
-Is that what you want?

00:22:47.263 --> 00:22:48.681
Of course not.

00:22:48.764 --> 00:22:52.059
Why would I when there's Han-gyul?
The three of us can go.

00:22:53.352 --> 00:22:54.437
You said you'll go.

00:22:55.021 --> 00:22:56.731
What? He got me.

00:22:56.814 --> 00:22:59.525
This Saturday at 12:00 p.m.
I'll pick you up at your place.

00:23:10.786 --> 00:23:12.079
Darn it.

00:23:19.086 --> 00:23:20.963
REPORT CARD

00:23:21.589 --> 00:23:24.884
Korean, second place.
Overall, second place.

00:23:24.967 --> 00:23:26.093
Grade 2.

00:23:26.594 --> 00:23:29.055
Everything is two!

00:23:32.725 --> 00:23:34.435
Remember what you said?

00:23:35.019 --> 00:23:37.563
You said you'd be the top student
at Shinsu High.

00:23:37.647 --> 00:23:39.857
You said you'd get Grade 1.

00:23:39.941 --> 00:23:40.858
Did I?

00:23:40.942 --> 00:23:43.736
I didn't say that.
You said that's what I should do.

00:23:43.819 --> 00:23:44.946
You must.

00:23:45.029 --> 00:23:48.783
Don't you know we're all stuck
in this countryside to get you Grade 1?

00:23:50.243 --> 00:23:51.327
Keep this in mind.

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:54.580
You have to keep getting
the best grades until you graduate

00:23:54.664 --> 00:23:56.749
to barely end up with Grade 1.

00:23:58.501 --> 00:23:59.835
Am I beef?

00:23:59.919 --> 00:24:02.213
You always go on about Grade 1
when you see me.

00:24:02.296 --> 00:24:04.715
Hey. If you want grade-one beef,

00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:06.801
you can buy it for 99,000 won, at least.

00:24:09.345 --> 00:24:12.014
I shouldn't eat it,
since its grade is higher than mine.

00:24:12.098 --> 00:24:12.932
Geez.

00:24:13.474 --> 00:24:16.644
That brat. If only you studied
as hard as you talk back.

00:24:16.727 --> 00:24:18.562
-That little…
-Goodness.

00:24:26.487 --> 00:24:29.865
Darn it. They're so frustrating!

00:24:29.949 --> 00:24:31.492
I hate them!

00:24:35.913 --> 00:24:37.498
JJUN

00:24:38.082 --> 00:24:39.125
Where are you?

00:24:41.085 --> 00:24:42.628
What are you doing this weekend?

00:24:43.546 --> 00:24:45.548
Can I stay at your place this weekend?

00:24:53.514 --> 00:24:55.433
Han-gyul, I'm home.

00:24:56.225 --> 00:24:57.101
Hey.

00:24:58.936 --> 00:24:59.770
Here.

00:25:01.939 --> 00:25:03.399
It's hot.

00:25:04.317 --> 00:25:06.902
Right. I heard Dong-pyo called you again.

00:25:06.986 --> 00:25:08.029
What did he say?

00:25:08.612 --> 00:25:11.073
Did you meet my teacher and argue again?

00:25:11.157 --> 00:25:12.867
Argue? Please.

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:15.202
We settled amicably.

00:25:16.162 --> 00:25:19.290
She agreed to decide
after checking out the place.

00:25:19.373 --> 00:25:20.458
Really?

00:25:20.541 --> 00:25:21.417
Of course.

00:25:22.001 --> 00:25:23.377
Don't you know your uncle?

00:25:24.879 --> 00:25:28.424
But the guys said she wouldn't bother
since she's an exchange teacher.

00:25:29.508 --> 00:25:31.552
Exchange teacher? What's that?

00:25:31.635 --> 00:25:33.346
She's going back to Seoul.

00:25:33.429 --> 00:25:34.263
What?

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:36.599
-When? Why?
-I don't know.

00:25:38.017 --> 00:25:40.853
But I wonder why
she came all the way down here.

00:25:42.229 --> 00:25:44.648
I think her family
and friends are all in Seoul.

00:26:08.464 --> 00:26:09.298
Sun Jae-gyu.

00:26:11.467 --> 00:26:13.511
If I let you get to me again today,

00:26:13.594 --> 00:26:15.388
I'm not human, I'm a squid.

00:26:15.471 --> 00:26:17.264
I'm a freaking dried radish.

00:26:22.144 --> 00:26:25.314
All right.
Time to start another gloomy day.

00:26:26.565 --> 00:26:27.608
Don't smile.

00:26:28.317 --> 00:26:29.568
Don't have fun.

00:26:30.444 --> 00:26:32.071
Don't be happy.

00:26:34.115 --> 00:26:35.116
You've got this.

00:26:35.199 --> 00:26:36.826
Ninety-six.

00:26:36.909 --> 00:26:38.411
Ninety-seven.

00:26:38.494 --> 00:26:39.912
Ninety-eight.

00:26:40.538 --> 00:26:42.164
Ninety-nine.

00:26:45.167 --> 00:26:47.586
Gosh, the weather's so nice today.

00:26:49.255 --> 00:26:50.297
What about Han-gyul?

00:26:52.007 --> 00:26:52.883
Hello, Ms. Yoon.

00:26:53.968 --> 00:26:55.261
I'll sit in the back--

00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:57.805
Get in.

00:27:06.021 --> 00:27:07.815
Now, put on your seat belt.

00:27:18.492 --> 00:27:19.785
Let's get going.

00:27:35.426 --> 00:27:36.802
Do you have plans after this?

00:27:38.053 --> 00:27:38.888
I don't.

00:27:40.097 --> 00:27:41.932
I thought you were going to a funeral.

00:27:43.559 --> 00:27:46.812
You always wear dark clothes,
as if you're in mourning.

00:27:49.982 --> 00:27:53.277
Did you just criticize my outfit?

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:56.071
What about you?
Why are you always dressed like that?

00:27:56.155 --> 00:27:59.200
Have you ever thought about
pursuing fashion, not function?

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.913
Working clothes
just need to be comfortable.

00:28:04.413 --> 00:28:07.166
Look. This is
four-way stretch spandex fabric.

00:28:07.917 --> 00:28:10.085
It's really comfortable when you work.

00:28:10.669 --> 00:28:12.254
Is your nickname "Shadow"?

00:28:12.338 --> 00:28:14.256
SE-JIN

00:28:17.426 --> 00:28:18.344
Hey.

00:28:18.969 --> 00:28:21.764
You said to tell you directly
if I had a problem with you.

00:28:23.682 --> 00:28:24.600
Where?

00:28:27.144 --> 00:28:28.187
Got it.

00:28:30.064 --> 00:28:31.524
Uncle, let me out.

00:28:40.449 --> 00:28:43.702
I'm sorry. Something urgent came up.
I'll join you later.

00:28:43.786 --> 00:28:44.662
Okay, see you.

00:28:45.955 --> 00:28:47.414
Han-gyul!

00:28:49.333 --> 00:28:50.459
What's with you?

00:28:50.543 --> 00:28:53.003
You let him out without asking him why?

00:28:53.087 --> 00:28:55.381
He can take care of himself. Why worry?

00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:57.341
Even so…

00:28:58.175 --> 00:29:00.010
So? Should we go without him?

00:29:00.719 --> 00:29:02.805
Of course, we should go with him.

00:29:03.722 --> 00:29:04.932
Then we'll wait.

00:29:07.977 --> 00:29:09.144
Want to go watch a movie?

00:29:09.728 --> 00:29:11.689
Why would I do that with a parent?

00:29:12.523 --> 00:29:13.816
Then…

00:29:13.899 --> 00:29:16.735
There's a quiet, secluded walking trail
over the underpass.

00:29:16.819 --> 00:29:17.861
How about going there?

00:29:18.529 --> 00:29:20.990
No. I don't like quiet, secluded places.

00:29:21.574 --> 00:29:24.910
Let's go to a loud and crowded place.

00:29:26.036 --> 00:29:26.912
Sure.

00:29:35.337 --> 00:29:37.256
SHINSU TERMINAL

00:29:46.015 --> 00:29:47.057
Choi Se-jin!

00:29:52.313 --> 00:29:53.230
What the heck?

00:29:54.231 --> 00:29:56.525
Did you come to find me?

00:29:57.151 --> 00:29:59.695
What were you talking about?
Run away because of me?

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:04.074
I'm always in second place because of you.

00:30:04.908 --> 00:30:08.370
Unless you vanish,
I'm going to end up in second place.

00:30:08.954 --> 00:30:11.999
But unfortunately, I'm someone
who must be in first place.

00:30:13.083 --> 00:30:15.961
So I'm leaving for a place without you.

00:30:25.387 --> 00:30:27.264
ARE YOU STAYING AT MY PLACE TONIGHT?

00:30:27.348 --> 00:30:28.766
YES. I'M LEAVING NOW.

00:30:29.683 --> 00:30:30.601
"Jjun"?

00:30:31.268 --> 00:30:32.394
Who is that?

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:37.775
Someone who'd love me
even if I'm in second place.

00:30:37.858 --> 00:30:38.692
Is it a man?

00:30:39.276 --> 00:30:40.277
Would it be a woman?

00:30:42.279 --> 00:30:43.322
Are you getting in?

00:30:43.405 --> 00:30:44.490
Coming.

00:30:45.658 --> 00:30:46.617
Hey.

00:30:47.326 --> 00:30:48.952
Take care, Grade 1.

00:30:56.251 --> 00:30:58.962
NO STOPOVERS
SHINSU TO SEOUL

00:31:04.176 --> 00:31:05.594
Sir!

00:31:20.484 --> 00:31:22.152
SUN JAE-GYU
I AM IN AWE

00:31:22.236 --> 00:31:24.238
Is there a celebrity named Sun Jae-gyu?

00:31:24.947 --> 00:31:28.033
Hey, there's an autograph
of someone named Sun Jae-gyu…

00:31:28.117 --> 00:31:29.034
That's me.

00:31:30.327 --> 00:31:32.371
Why do you write your name everywhere?

00:31:39.086 --> 00:31:40.671
Don't bother looking at the menu.

00:31:40.754 --> 00:31:42.589
The only thing we should order

00:31:43.173 --> 00:31:44.091
is osam bulgogi.

00:31:47.928 --> 00:31:51.098
LACQUER CHICKEN SOUP AVAILABLE

00:31:53.225 --> 00:31:54.643
-It's good.
-Really?

00:31:55.144 --> 00:31:56.145
Want some more?

00:31:58.105 --> 00:31:59.732
You have to get better soon.

00:32:00.983 --> 00:32:02.109
Open up.

00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:18.167
Two osam bulgogis, please.

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:19.460
Lacquer chicken soup.

00:32:20.794 --> 00:32:22.212
Large or medium?

00:32:22.296 --> 00:32:23.756
Medium, please.

00:32:24.423 --> 00:32:26.049
Damn it.

00:32:26.633 --> 00:32:30.345
I'll take you to a bathhouse
and boil you in the hottest tub.

00:32:30.429 --> 00:32:33.807
Before I make your freaking waist
look like an hourglass,

00:32:33.891 --> 00:32:34.975
order the large one.

00:32:35.058 --> 00:32:36.059
Understood?

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:38.812
Answer me!

00:32:38.896 --> 00:32:39.813
Okay!

00:32:39.897 --> 00:32:41.774
Large, please.

00:32:41.857 --> 00:32:43.192
Large. Yes.

00:32:48.363 --> 00:32:49.448
She still looks healthy.

00:33:21.522 --> 00:33:22.898
You don't have an appetite?

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.945
You see...

00:33:29.363 --> 00:33:33.784
I've lost money, friends,
and even the will to live,

00:33:34.326 --> 00:33:37.579
but I've never lost
my appetite in my life.

00:33:39.081 --> 00:33:40.749
Then you must be a picky eater.

00:33:43.669 --> 00:33:47.798
I've never produced any food waste
except for watermelon rinds.

00:33:48.549 --> 00:33:49.383
I see.

00:33:58.475 --> 00:33:59.977
Wait, the way he eats,

00:34:00.686 --> 00:34:02.437
I think I've seen it before.

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:09.069
What is it?

00:34:10.571 --> 00:34:11.488
Oh, nothing.

00:34:12.072 --> 00:34:13.907
Not long ago, I think I saw

00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:16.827
someone similar to you
in front of a police station.

00:34:19.413 --> 00:34:20.289
Did you see that?

00:34:22.875 --> 00:34:25.294
I ended up there
because I did something to a woman.

00:34:27.546 --> 00:34:29.423
What did you do to that woman?

00:34:52.446 --> 00:34:53.530
-What?
-Come on!

00:34:54.615 --> 00:34:55.949
You damn punk.

00:34:56.033 --> 00:34:58.327
How dare you touch my car?

00:34:58.410 --> 00:34:59.620
Are you insane?

00:34:59.703 --> 00:35:01.747
This is a brand-new car
I got her yesterday.

00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:03.040
I didn't really touch it.

00:35:03.123 --> 00:35:05.208
Hello? Is this the police?

00:35:05.792 --> 00:35:09.296
-I want to report someone.
-Tell them to come and get this crazy guy.

00:35:09.379 --> 00:35:11.924
-My goodness!
-Report or sue me, do that later.

00:35:12.007 --> 00:35:12.841
Move aside.

00:35:12.925 --> 00:35:14.760
Get out of the way, now.

00:35:19.097 --> 00:35:21.308
-I should take a picture.
-Come on!

00:35:22.601 --> 00:35:24.061
Look carefully.

00:35:24.144 --> 00:35:25.228
Move aside.

00:35:30.692 --> 00:35:32.778
I hardly even touched it.

00:35:33.403 --> 00:35:34.738
"Touched it"?

00:35:35.238 --> 00:35:36.865
And her husband had to be there.

00:35:36.949 --> 00:35:38.116
In front of her husband?

00:35:39.326 --> 00:35:42.329
This kind of thing happens often.
It's okay. Don't worry.

00:35:46.124 --> 00:35:47.292
By any chance,

00:35:49.294 --> 00:35:51.630
the scar on Mr. Hong's palm…

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:54.424
Was it your doing?

00:36:07.062 --> 00:36:09.439
What the hell is a teacher doing here?

00:36:16.655 --> 00:36:18.865
Maybe he didn't want
to give Han-gyul the award

00:36:18.949 --> 00:36:20.117
-because of that.
-My hand.

00:36:37.092 --> 00:36:38.677
Han-gyul is running late.

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.804
I think we should go home for today.

00:36:46.435 --> 00:36:48.186
Mr. Sun, your face…

00:36:49.563 --> 00:36:50.480
Your face is…

00:37:05.412 --> 00:37:08.540
Geez, a man shouldn't get
hives on his face

00:37:08.623 --> 00:37:09.833
over some food.

00:37:14.546 --> 00:37:16.882
How could you be so foolish?

00:37:18.008 --> 00:37:21.636
I recover really fast,
so it'll all be gone in an hour, okay?

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:26.266
If you had an allergy,
you should've let me eat it alone.

00:37:27.559 --> 00:37:28.602
Come on.

00:37:29.352 --> 00:37:31.938
You wouldn't have enjoyed it, then.

00:37:32.022 --> 00:37:34.691
Food tastes best when you eat it together.

00:37:34.775 --> 00:37:35.776
Aren't I right?

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:46.495
Are you laughing?

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:03.095
Don't smile.

00:38:04.638 --> 00:38:05.889
Don't have fun.

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:08.642
Don't be happy.

00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:19.653
Let me see your face.

00:39:17.419 --> 00:39:18.461
Oh, no!

00:39:30.098 --> 00:39:31.975
Look. Don't ever

00:39:32.767 --> 00:39:34.644
touch my body again. Okay?

00:39:55.624 --> 00:39:56.833
Hey, Han-gyul.

00:39:58.960 --> 00:39:59.878
Okay.

00:40:00.462 --> 00:40:01.588
With who?

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:04.758
Where?

00:40:05.884 --> 00:40:07.135
What's going on?

00:40:08.887 --> 00:40:10.055
Do you have money?

00:40:12.015 --> 00:40:12.933
I understand.

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:16.645
Buy her a meal as soon as you arrive,
and take care of her.

00:40:17.229 --> 00:40:19.689
Text me where you are later,
and I'll go get you.

00:40:21.441 --> 00:40:22.567
Okay, bye.

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:25.445
I'm afraid I have to go.

00:40:25.528 --> 00:40:27.447
Why? Where's Han-gyul?

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:28.782
Who is he with?

00:40:31.868 --> 00:40:32.702
Well…

00:40:33.578 --> 00:40:36.706
His classmate named Choi Se-jin
ran away from home.

00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:37.916
And he followed her.

00:40:37.999 --> 00:40:39.793
-Se-jin?
-Yes.

00:40:39.876 --> 00:40:41.836
I can't give you a ride. Get home safe.

00:40:44.339 --> 00:40:45.715
"Get home safe"?

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.552
I'm their homeroom teacher,
not you, Mr. Sun.

00:40:55.141 --> 00:40:56.226
Where do we go?

00:41:00.605 --> 00:41:01.439
To Seoul.

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:11.992
PARENT-TEACHER MEETING ON EDUCATION

00:41:12.075 --> 00:41:13.410
Take good care of my kid.

00:41:13.493 --> 00:41:15.453
Sure. Thank you so much for coming.

00:41:16.746 --> 00:41:18.206
Hello, ma'am.

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:19.791
I'm A-ram's father.

00:41:20.834 --> 00:41:23.670
Thank you for taking the time
out of your busy schedule.

00:41:24.337 --> 00:41:27.382
A-ram must be happy
since she has such a caring dad.

00:41:27.465 --> 00:41:28.466
Well, yes.

00:41:29.801 --> 00:41:30.635
Thank you.

00:41:39.978 --> 00:41:41.980
GETS ALONG WITH FRIENDS
AND IS RESPONSIBLE…

00:41:48.695 --> 00:41:49.529
OH A-RAM'S FATHER

00:41:49.612 --> 00:41:51.740
How was your day? Was it good?

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:56.703
If you have a hard time at school,
let me know.

00:41:56.786 --> 00:42:00.415
As you said, I'm quite a caring man.

00:42:00.498 --> 00:42:04.544
What's the perfume you were wearing
at school? I can't stop thinking about it.

00:42:06.212 --> 00:42:08.757
Why aren't you replying? I miss you.

00:42:10.717 --> 00:42:12.844
Where are you? Can we meet for a moment?

00:42:23.021 --> 00:42:24.356
I'm so disappointed.

00:42:26.441 --> 00:42:27.525
Is it true?

00:42:27.609 --> 00:42:29.736
No way. Ms. Bom would never do that.

00:42:29.819 --> 00:42:30.987
They have proof.

00:42:31.071 --> 00:42:33.656
If they didn't,
why would A-ram's mom do that?

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:37.035
She pretended to be all ethical,
but she was having an affair.

00:42:37.118 --> 00:42:40.288
Gosh, she's disgusting.
She makes me throw up.

00:42:47.754 --> 00:42:48.713
What's wrong?

00:42:54.344 --> 00:42:55.178
Never mind.

00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:59.391
Let's go…

00:43:02.268 --> 00:43:03.311
to Seoul.

00:43:37.011 --> 00:43:38.638
Hey, Evil Han-gyul.

00:43:39.639 --> 00:43:40.598
"Evil Han-gyul"?

00:43:40.682 --> 00:43:43.518
This is why I call you Evil Han-gyul.

00:43:43.601 --> 00:43:45.728
I ran away from home because of you.

00:43:46.312 --> 00:43:48.064
I ran away to get away from you,

00:43:48.148 --> 00:43:50.608
so why are you following me
and bothering me?

00:43:51.317 --> 00:43:52.444
Aren't you hungry?

00:43:53.403 --> 00:43:54.988
Let's go eat by the Hangang River.

00:43:56.948 --> 00:43:59.200
Why would a runaway
do such a romantic thing?

00:44:00.076 --> 00:44:03.079
I didn't run all the way here
to do normal things like that.

00:44:03.872 --> 00:44:05.707
This is my first time in Seoul.

00:44:06.291 --> 00:44:07.125
What?

00:44:08.042 --> 00:44:10.378
You've never been to places
like Seoul World Tower?

00:44:10.462 --> 00:44:11.963
I've only seen them online.

00:44:14.174 --> 00:44:17.552
Since it's my first time here,
I should do something before I go back.

00:44:18.261 --> 00:44:21.431
And we skipped lunch
because we took a bus.

00:44:24.517 --> 00:44:26.186
Whether you run away or do whatever,

00:44:26.686 --> 00:44:28.354
do it after you eat.

00:44:29.272 --> 00:44:30.440
Let's go.

00:44:32.358 --> 00:44:33.318
Follow me.

00:44:44.913 --> 00:44:46.915
How does it feel to be overly talented?

00:44:51.044 --> 00:44:53.922
I'm never talented enough.

00:44:55.131 --> 00:44:57.592
I failed to get into a better school,

00:44:57.675 --> 00:44:59.385
and I'm always in second place.

00:45:01.054 --> 00:45:03.681
And you get Grade 1
when you're not going to college.

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:06.434
And you're always in first place.

00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:08.853
Are you jealous?

00:45:10.146 --> 00:45:11.439
I'm frustrated.

00:45:13.608 --> 00:45:14.984
Can I ask you something?

00:45:16.194 --> 00:45:18.071
How does it feel to have parents?

00:45:19.197 --> 00:45:20.823
It really sucks.

00:45:21.366 --> 00:45:23.660
It sucks even more not to have parents.

00:45:25.119 --> 00:45:27.372
Now I can't live with my dad
even for a day.

00:45:27.455 --> 00:45:29.749
I wish I could live with my dad for a day.

00:45:29.832 --> 00:45:31.668
And I don't want to talk to my mom.

00:45:31.751 --> 00:45:33.795
I wish I could talk to my mom
for a second.

00:45:34.837 --> 00:45:36.673
You have such a good uncle.

00:45:37.465 --> 00:45:39.551
No matter how good, he's still not my mom.

00:45:41.261 --> 00:45:42.804
Hong Jung-pyo told me

00:45:43.513 --> 00:45:45.890
I have no parents,
so I can't get the Filial Award.

00:45:46.683 --> 00:45:49.936
I wasn't angry because he said
he wouldn't give me the award.

00:45:51.312 --> 00:45:53.189
It was because I felt like he was right...

00:45:55.316 --> 00:45:57.694
Sometimes, being good to my uncle

00:45:57.777 --> 00:46:00.780
feels like I'm just repaying him
for what he did for me.

00:46:07.161 --> 00:46:07.996
Evil Han-gyul.

00:46:09.539 --> 00:46:11.332
You never fail to beat me.

00:46:12.917 --> 00:46:14.127
In this situation,

00:46:14.627 --> 00:46:17.005
you pull the "no-parents" card?

00:46:17.088 --> 00:46:19.382
You're just making me look bad.

00:46:30.310 --> 00:46:32.270
MEET ME AT HANGANG RIVER STATION AT 8

00:46:36.858 --> 00:46:39.861
I hope you've made
pleasant memories in Seoul.

00:46:40.403 --> 00:46:41.779
I enjoyed talking to you.

00:46:43.197 --> 00:46:44.198
Where are you going?

00:46:45.867 --> 00:46:46.701
Se-jin!

00:46:47.619 --> 00:46:48.453
Hey!

00:46:55.293 --> 00:46:56.377
What are you doing?

00:46:56.461 --> 00:46:59.672
My back hurts so much
because of that stupid pot.

00:47:01.049 --> 00:47:03.926
This is bad.
Tomorrow is my wife's birthday.

00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:06.012
My wrists hurt too,

00:47:06.095 --> 00:47:09.432
and my neck feels so stiff.
I'm not feeling well.

00:47:09.515 --> 00:47:11.351
If it were ten years ago,

00:47:11.434 --> 00:47:13.895
when Sun Jae-gyu came into the office,

00:47:13.978 --> 00:47:16.981
I would've had him
in a headlock and choked him.

00:47:17.065 --> 00:47:18.024
Right?

00:47:18.816 --> 00:47:20.026
By the way,

00:47:20.693 --> 00:47:23.821
it's the sports festival tomorrow,
but our PE teacher's in bad shape.

00:47:24.822 --> 00:47:26.282
You heard the principal, right?

00:47:26.366 --> 00:47:29.285
Our school's sports festival
is basically Shinsu's Olympics.

00:47:29.369 --> 00:47:30.787
He's putting in so much effort.

00:47:31.871 --> 00:47:33.122
Speaking of which,

00:47:33.206 --> 00:47:35.875
why don't we work out together?

00:47:36.459 --> 00:47:37.418
-Work out?
-Yes.

00:47:37.502 --> 00:47:39.087
Let's do it. I'm in.

00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:41.214
But what would be good?

00:47:41.297 --> 00:47:43.800
If we want to learn skills fast,

00:47:43.883 --> 00:47:46.052
-we should do boxing.
-Oh, boxing.

00:47:46.135 --> 00:47:48.262
Learn fast? I'll end up hurting my knees.

00:47:48.346 --> 00:47:51.724
Then, how about we begin
with something light like soccer?

00:47:52.308 --> 00:47:55.520
I'm quite introverted,
so I can't play with strangers.

00:47:55.603 --> 00:47:56.979
Then how about climbing?

00:47:57.063 --> 00:47:58.690
That's best for muscle strengthening.

00:47:58.773 --> 00:48:00.942
Don't you know I have a fear of heights?

00:48:01.025 --> 00:48:03.194
You say no to everything!
What should we do then?

00:48:03.277 --> 00:48:04.362
I don't know.

00:48:06.447 --> 00:48:07.407
I got it.

00:48:08.074 --> 00:48:11.411
It won't hurt your knees.
It's okay even if you're an introvert

00:48:11.494 --> 00:48:13.955
or have a fear of heights.
It's perfect for us.

00:48:15.164 --> 00:48:16.040
What is it?

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:39.981
Mr. Hong said he'd come,
but he's not here.

00:48:40.064 --> 00:48:41.357
Why are you here instead?

00:48:41.983 --> 00:48:44.318
I want to become like Han-gyul's uncle.

00:48:44.402 --> 00:48:45.236
What?

00:48:46.904 --> 00:48:48.406
Listen, ma'am.

00:48:48.489 --> 00:48:52.034
Have you ever heard the saying that
you can't grow teeth at the age of 80?

00:48:52.118 --> 00:48:55.747
Snails may cross the ocean
and boiled beans may sprout,

00:48:56.247 --> 00:48:59.959
but how can a woman become like him
when even men can't?

00:49:00.042 --> 00:49:02.170
That's exactly why I'm doing this!

00:49:02.253 --> 00:49:05.631
You male teachers
look down on women like this,

00:49:05.715 --> 00:49:08.509
so of course, the male students
never listen to women!

00:49:08.593 --> 00:49:10.803
They say teachers' authority
has hit rock bottom.

00:49:10.887 --> 00:49:13.222
But do you know
where female teachers' authority lies?

00:49:13.306 --> 00:49:15.183
It's underground!

00:49:17.935 --> 00:49:19.103
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:49:19.979 --> 00:49:20.813
Hello.

00:49:25.485 --> 00:49:26.694
I'm glad you came.

00:49:26.778 --> 00:49:27.612
Master.

00:49:28.237 --> 00:49:31.574
I really want to learn the skills
as fast as possible.

00:49:31.657 --> 00:49:32.909
How long will it take?

00:49:32.992 --> 00:49:35.870
Well, it depends on the person,

00:49:35.953 --> 00:49:38.915
but I can guarantee
that trainees at my dojo learn

00:49:38.998 --> 00:49:41.292
twice as fast as those at other dojos.

00:49:42.502 --> 00:49:45.588
You must have some kind of secret method.

00:49:48.132 --> 00:49:51.969
You see, there's a legendary black belt
at this dojo.

00:50:02.355 --> 00:50:05.650
He's one of the 700 great masters
in Korea.

00:50:14.867 --> 00:50:18.120
He's an elite who went from a white belt
to a black belt in seven years.

00:50:22.208 --> 00:50:25.711
He even perfectly mastered
the legendary Imanari Roll.

00:50:25.795 --> 00:50:27.255
He's the pride of our dojo.

00:50:29.674 --> 00:50:32.677
If you spar with him,
your skills and stamina will...

00:50:33.469 --> 00:50:34.679
get better fast.

00:50:36.597 --> 00:50:38.432
When is that great person coming?

00:50:39.517 --> 00:50:42.311
He usually shows up around this time.

00:50:43.062 --> 00:50:46.274
I wonder what happened. He's late today.

00:51:01.831 --> 00:51:03.082
Are you sure he's here?

00:51:04.333 --> 00:51:06.502
He texted me he was here five minutes ago.

00:51:08.087 --> 00:51:10.339
I guess he can't answer
because he's with her.

00:51:13.384 --> 00:51:16.178
Let's split up.
You go right, and I'll go left.

00:51:16.804 --> 00:51:17.680
Okay.

00:51:19.098 --> 00:51:20.808
Where did this punk go? Darn it.

00:51:49.170 --> 00:51:50.004
Jjun!

00:51:52.381 --> 00:51:54.008
I missed you so much!

00:51:54.634 --> 00:51:57.845
I lost my way. Seoul is so far.

00:51:57.929 --> 00:52:00.723
I'm so hungry.
Buy me something delicious, please?

00:52:07.605 --> 00:52:09.273
-Uncle!
-Hey.

00:52:10.858 --> 00:52:11.984
Why are you alone?

00:52:12.485 --> 00:52:13.945
What about Choi Se-jin?

00:52:14.654 --> 00:52:16.530
-I lost her.
-You lost her?

00:52:17.865 --> 00:52:20.952
To tell the truth, I didn't tell you
because you'd worry,

00:52:21.035 --> 00:52:22.954
but she kept texting some guy.

00:52:23.829 --> 00:52:25.957
And the guy told her to stay the night...

00:52:27.792 --> 00:52:29.251
at his place.

00:52:29.961 --> 00:52:31.212
At his place?

00:52:32.129 --> 00:52:36.842
The Inner Circle train toward Hangang Naru
is now approaching.

00:52:41.931 --> 00:52:43.641
Se-jin!

00:52:46.268 --> 00:52:47.103
Darn it.

00:52:55.236 --> 00:52:56.070
Hello?

00:52:57.154 --> 00:52:57.989
I found her.

00:52:59.031 --> 00:53:01.617
We just got on the train,
but she's with some guy.

00:53:02.201 --> 00:53:03.244
I'm coming.

00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:07.373
We don't know who he is.
Who knows what he'll do to you?

00:53:07.456 --> 00:53:08.457
Wait right there.

00:53:11.252 --> 00:53:12.962
I can't. The train's leaving now.

00:53:13.045 --> 00:53:15.047
Then let's meet at the next station.

00:53:15.131 --> 00:53:16.257
The next station?

00:53:17.091 --> 00:53:18.175
How will we…

00:53:18.884 --> 00:53:20.011
Hello?

00:53:20.094 --> 00:53:21.262
Take the next train.

00:53:24.598 --> 00:53:25.433
No way.

00:54:03.763 --> 00:54:05.306
YOUR CURRENT SPEED

00:54:10.227 --> 00:54:12.313
SLOW DOWN

00:55:11.038 --> 00:55:12.414
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

00:55:14.125 --> 00:55:15.084
We've got this!

00:55:18.587 --> 00:55:20.297
-Let's go!
-What the heck?

00:55:23.968 --> 00:55:24.927
I'm coming.

00:55:25.636 --> 00:55:26.929
Just wait for me.

00:55:29.723 --> 00:55:33.894
This stop is Hangang Naru Station.

00:55:33.978 --> 00:55:34.979
The doors…

00:55:37.523 --> 00:55:39.483
PROTECT THE EARTH!
NO EARTH, NO US

00:56:19.023 --> 00:56:19.940
I knew it.

00:56:27.656 --> 00:56:28.699
What?

00:56:30.492 --> 00:56:31.327
Choi Se-jin!

00:56:32.036 --> 00:56:34.747
Excuse me. I'm sorry. Coming through.

00:56:36.081 --> 00:56:37.499
Get out of the way!

00:56:39.627 --> 00:56:40.794
Move.

00:56:44.632 --> 00:56:45.925
Mr. Sun?

00:57:41.063 --> 00:57:43.232
Now I remember

00:57:44.066 --> 00:57:44.984
this man.

00:58:57.598 --> 00:58:58.766
Mister.

00:58:58.849 --> 00:59:00.726
Sun Jae-gyu?

00:59:00.809 --> 00:59:04.438
I wanted to forgive him,
but I want to take revenge now.

00:59:04.521 --> 00:59:06.065
Didn't you lose your other half?

00:59:08.734 --> 00:59:09.610
Can you treat it?

00:59:09.693 --> 00:59:11.320
You've fallen for him.

00:59:11.403 --> 00:59:14.948
What's a guy like Sun Jae-gyu
doing with a woman like that?

00:59:15.032 --> 00:59:17.534
She was crying her eyes out.

00:59:18.202 --> 00:59:19.995
Look carefully from now on.

00:59:20.537 --> 00:59:22.289
It's definitely an approval.

00:59:22.373 --> 00:59:23.415
Jae-gyu!

00:59:27.378 --> 00:59:29.380
