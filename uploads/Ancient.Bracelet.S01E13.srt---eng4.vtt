=Episode 13=

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.660
=Be Mine=

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.640
(I didn't die.)

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.070
(I've lived again.)

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.030
(Why am I here?)

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.900
(Yan Manor · Winter, Year 5 of Yuanqi)
(The clan is all gone.)

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.870
(Whose wedding could it be?)

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:19.550
Zhaoli,

00:01:20.726 --> 00:01:22.120
I've brought you the wedding attire.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.070
Hurry and see if it fits.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.190
(Che?)

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.070
Why step outside dressed so thinly?

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.070
You've just recovered.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.376
You must take care of yourself.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.500
Che,

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.870
you're still alive.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.230
If I had died,

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.480
who'd marry you?

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.510
Still half-asleep, aren't you?

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.560
Where's Grandmother?

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.710
Is Grandmother still alive?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.840
Grandmother?

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.200
Zhaoli.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.710
Zhaoli.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.120
I've mended your phoenix hairpin.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.030
Zhaoli,

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:18.710
go...

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.590
Silly child.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.630
Your wedding is tomorrow.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.470
Already reluctant to leave me?

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.120
(They're all still alive.)

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.150
(That's wonderful.)

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.430
(Everything that happened before...)

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.640
Che,

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.630
what year is it now?

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.280
Year 5 of Yuanqi.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.630
(Year 5 of Yuanqi.)

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.030
(I've gone back three months.)

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.400
(At this point,)

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.520
(I've saved Ying Du.)

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.840
(But Yan Che hasn't returned.)

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.800
(And I haven't married him.)

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.430
(Has everything changed)

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.120
(because I was reborn?)

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.360
Zhaoli,

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.680
the ruler just sent someone for you.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.310
Things between him and me
are tense right now.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.840
I'm afraid he might trouble you
because of it.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.120
(No, I must not see him again.)

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.240
Che,

00:03:24.322 --> 00:03:25.743
help me decline the ruler's summons.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.800
I'm going out for some air.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.800
Probably feeling shy.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.120
Let her have some quiet time alone.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.080
It's fine.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.960
(This life has taken
a completely different turn.)

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.870
(Would Ying Du still retain
those memories?)

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.910
(Ying Du...)

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:57.710
(Thank heavens.)

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.310
(Not that tyrant.)

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.800
How dare you defy my summons?

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.000
How bold of you.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:14.910
Let go of me!

00:04:14.926 --> 00:04:15.840
I saved your life once.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.160
We're even now.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:21.310
Let go of me!

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.560
Let me go!

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.510
I heard you're to marry Yan Che.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.830
Do you know we've never seen eye to eye?

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.950
Since you once saved me,

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.720
allow me to show you a better path.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.160
Be mine.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.680
That's better than becoming a widow.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.560
Who'd ever want to be yours?

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:40.430
Let go!

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.270
Never!

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.183
(It seems he's lost all memories.)

00:04:45.436 --> 00:04:46.950
(I can't get entangled with him again.)

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.430
Can't you see I'm in a wedding dress?

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.286
Che and I have been betrothed
since childhood.

00:04:50.297 --> 00:04:51.950
I will only be his honey.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.270
Your taste in men

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.070
is truly beyond terrible.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.920
Let go of me.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.070
This wedding robe is such an eyesore.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.120
Take it off.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.830
You must be out of your mind.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:04.670
Let go.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.860
(Everlasting Joy)

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.160
Let go of me.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.160
Your Majesty,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.270
I have matters to report.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.360
My husband is here.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:17.680
You'd better release me now.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.640
Husband?

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.750
That's so close.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:21.680
Yes.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.270
Che and I will wed tomorrow.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.830
Do you mean to take

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.680
another man's wife, Your Majesty?

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:28.920
So what if I do?

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.950
This marriage will never happen.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.040
You are shameless!

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.800
When you finally see

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.750
that the one you trust with your life

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.160
is the one who hurt you most,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.430
the most wicked of them all,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.560
you'll come to thank me.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.750
But right now,

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.870
the so-called villain you speak of

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.270
has never harmed me in the slightest.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.680
The one who brought me pain

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.120
is you alone.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.920
Since you trust him so deeply,

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.190
let's just see

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.560
if he will truly protect you.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.160
Let go of me!

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.080
Let me go!

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.150
Your Majesty,

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.630
this is urgent.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.590
(Everlasting Joy)
Please, grant an audience.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.640
Enter.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.673
Shouldn't you be preparing
for your wedding?

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.120
What matter could be so urgent?

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.190
Your Majesty,

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.800
have you seen my wife?

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.120
You lost your wife;

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.160
why come here looking for her?

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.240
You've become increasingly insolent.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.840
Leave!

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.700
(Everlasting Joy)

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:13.600
You've gone too far.

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.000
Do you mean to kill me?

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.880
Yes.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.190
I'd kill you a million times if I could.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.720
You've harmed the ruler's body.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.560
Do you realize what that means?

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:32.880
Right.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:35.800
You can heal yourself.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.160
Then why humiliate me like this?

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:39.270
It can heal on its own,

00:07:39.729 --> 00:07:40.670
but I don't want that.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.070
If you can't tend to my wound in time,

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:45.920
then your Che

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:47.430
will die.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:49.870
You're the ruler.

00:07:49.881 --> 00:07:51.767
Is all you can do
to throw your weight around?

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:53.040
You can come to get

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.800
to know me slowly later.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:56.600
If you wish to leave,

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.000
be good and apply the medicine.
