WEBVTT

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.440
Thank you all for coming
to my birthday party today.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.720
Enjoy yourselves, everyone.
Enjoy yourselves.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.040
North.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.960
Why are you avoiding me?

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.760
Hi, Pai. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.000
When did you get here—

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.200
Why aren’t you wearing red?

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.800
Don’t you know it’s not auspicious?

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.760
I forgot.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.360
Put this on.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.120
We don’t want anyone scolding you.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.440
Thank you.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.560
That’s so romantic.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.520
He’s proposing in front of
our whole family,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.760
and on Grandpa’s birthday, too.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.840
Grandpa must be so surprised.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.720
Grandpa already knew about it.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.200
What do you mean?

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.240
It’s a strategic marriage.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.800
Their family is a
gas station franchise owner,

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.960
and our family owns
a convenience store chain.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.320
Eventually, our convenience stores
will be available at all their gas stations.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.160
For someone like us, North,

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.720
marriage is just something
that is arranged to benefit both families.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.560
Ugh.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.440
You’re so unromantic, Pai.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.880
I don’t think it’s just for business, though.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.640
They agree to get married, after all.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.680
I’m sure they must have feelings
for each other, at least.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.880
I’d like to hope so.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.520
I must, once again, congratulate
our family’s newest couple.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.320
Once you tie the knot,

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.560
make me proud and
have children right away.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.840
And thank you, all of you,
for coming to my birthday party today.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.800
How glad I am to see our family
prosperous and expanding.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.360
I hope you will all continue
to work hard to fulfill your duties.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.600
It puts my mind at ease
to see our family doing so well.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.880
Happy birthday.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.600
Happy birthday, Grandpa.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:43.960
- Happy birthday, Papa.
- Happy birthday.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.120
Thanks.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.920
Pai.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.880
You’ve been managing our shopping mall
for a while.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.720
How is it going?

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.720
It’s been great, Grandpa.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.560
We’re reshuffling our marketing strategy
to fit with new customers.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.040
I believe the numbers will turn out better
by the end of the year.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.640
I see.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.200
Any plans to get married soon?

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.920
Pardon?

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.600
Getting married.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.840
Do you have any plans to?

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.160
Doesn’t matter if you marry
a woman or a man.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.440
You know I don’t mind that kind of thing.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.160
It’d give me some peace of mind to know

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.080
you have someone nice
to take care of you.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.200
It’s only been a while
since I became the CEO,

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.920
I don’t think I have time
for a relationship right now.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.920
You don’t have time for a relationship?

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.680
I was watching that show,
Bangkok Gossip,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and they said you’ve been dating,
who is it…

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.320
An actor whose name starts with J.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.400
I broke up with him, Auntie.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.400
There’s no reason not to
find someone new.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.400
I’m sure it’s not beyond your ability.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.920
But I think—

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.400
Just do it for Grandpa’s peace of mind.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.400
Of course.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.720
Da Zhan, take this as an example, love.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.960
Don’t be stubborn like your cousin Pai.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.120
He can’t even make Grandpa happy.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.880
Grandpa.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:06.160
Hmm?

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.720
Don’t you want to see me
married and settled, too?

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.000
You were only asking Pai.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.560
How could you get married, North?

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.000
You’re a child.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.920
Just stay with Grandpa for now.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.840
Wait a few more years,

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.760
and if you want to get married,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
I’ll be on board.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.840
You promise, Grandpa?

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.440
Thank you.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.840
Speaking of which…

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.760
Don’t you want your cousin to teach you
the ropes of our trade, North?

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.120
I…

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.800
I think I…

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.600
I want to try and learn to do business
on my own.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.920
How so?

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:49.600
Well…

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.480
I actually…

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.760
I have an idea…

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.560
My friend and I want to open a bakery.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.200
Please, Grandpa?

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.840
Well, I don’t see why not.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.040
Oh, I love you so much, Grandpa.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.720
New Caption

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.800
I’ve placed your new suit in your office, sir.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.200
You have an interview with Fobes
at half past noon.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.960
I have drafted some answers
for you for the interview.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.800
There’s a board meeting at 2 p.m.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.880
And at 7 p.m., a one-hour call
with our Khon Khaen branch.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.880
After that, you have dinner with Mr. Win.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.480
I’ve rescheduled it for 8.30 p.m.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.880
What do you think, Mr. Pai?

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.720
Why did we reschedule?

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.680
Uh, I thought you might be too tired.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.000
It’s alright.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.080
It’s just dinner.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.240
Let’s not inconvenience him.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.840
Are you alright?

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.080
You’re panting.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.480
Oh, no.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.000
I am not panting.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.000
Ouch!

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:28.760
Yes!

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.640
Ugh, I’m not playing with you anymore!

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.440
Oww.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:33.960
Dang it.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:42.560
Pure.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.320
Let’s open a bakery.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:48.720
What?

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.360
What are you trying to do?

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.160
Well, I…

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.640
I want to try my hands at small business.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:02.600
Small?

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.560
What about your hair salon, car wash,
Labubus, and photo booth?

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.960
- Ugh!
- Huh?

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.360
There’s no point dwelling on
what’s in the past, you know?

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.360
We should focus on something positive.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:26.680
Fine!

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.560
Grandpa wants me to work with Pai,

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.600
but I don’t want to.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.760
The bakery is just an excuse
for me to get out of it.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.080
Now that sounds more like you.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.680
Let’s do it anyway.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.680
Help me be free from my cousin
for at least the next two years.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:48.800
Honestly?

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.280
I don’t understand you and your cousin.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.040
One is an all-rounded gentleman.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.720
The other is…

00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.560
Handsome?

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.720
A loser!

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.680
Watch it.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.280
But to tell you the truth,

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.080
I can’t even blame Pai.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.360
It was my bad luck that my parents
both died right after I was born,

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.960
and I had to live with Pai.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.200
Why don’t you just try to be nice to him?

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.800
He stresses me the hell out.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:24.440
He’s such a stickler.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.640
He gives me an earful
for even the smallest mistakes.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:28.760
Gives me goosebumps.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:38.040
Please?

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:41.920
Fine.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:42.640
Yes!

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.240
I’m due for a date.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:46.760
Bye.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.080
Oh.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.520
You’re just gonna run off, huh?

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.520
Another business failure incoming.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:18.480
(Photos from Grandpa Soepohn’s birthday
party shot by Da Zhan.)

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.280
JEERAMONKOLTHANUN (20)

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:45.840
Nana.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.360
Ms. Nana.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:51.800
Ms. Nana!

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.040
Y–Yes, sir!

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.200
I already got it done.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.920
I’m going on a walk.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.240
I’ll finish the rest of the work afterward.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:01.920
Why don’t you go home and rest?

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:03.680
Are you sure, sir?

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:05.240
Hello.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:06.800
Hello.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.800
I… dropped my car key into this pond.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.200
I don’t know what the owner of this place
was thinking to put so many ponds in here.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.200
Maybe they believed
their feng shui master so much

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.200
that they forgot to think about
customers’ safety.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:24.920
I guess so.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.080
Oh.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.080
I’m Tim.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:29.480
I’m an architect.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.960
I was here to meet my client about
interior design.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.440
We lost track of time while talking.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.440
Next thing we knew, the mall was closed.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.320
I’m Pai.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.560
Do you work here, Mr. Pai?

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.240
You can say that.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.120
Your boss must be really harsh

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.440
to lock you in here
and make you work well into the night.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:51.960
I’m happy to do it.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:11.000
Did you find your key?

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:12.400
No.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.920
You fell down because
you were helping me.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.360
I couldn’t possibly let you
get in here alone, could I?

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:53.560
Or we can just go crazy?

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.200
Tim!

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:58.280
There!

00:13:58.840 --> 00:13:59.440
Pai!

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:00.760
We’re not children.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.120
Who would even do that?

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.560
You started it.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.120
You splashed me first.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:09.560
Tim!

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.040
Take that!

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:16.040
Mr. Tim?

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:19.600
Are you alright?

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:32.720
Gotcha!

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.960
3-58 is over there.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.160
Thank you so much, Mr. Pai.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.200
If it weren’t for you, I’m afraid
I might have to sleep here at this mall.

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.840
Aren’t you going home?

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.720
Please don’t tell me your boss
really does lock you in here.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.240
Tell me if that’s the case. I’m reporting
your boss to the Ministry of Labor.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:14.520
Actually… I own this place.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.440
Ah…

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.320
This is like one of those micro-dramas.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.880
About what I said earlier at the fountain
and other stuff,

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.520
I’m really sorry.

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:29.520
It’s alright.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.600
I’m not a big fan of the fountain
in that particular area myself.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.280
But I really couldn’t go against
my family’s feng shui master.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.960
Well, then I guess
you need to take responsibility.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:45.960
For making a customer like me fall…
into the water.

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.840
Maybe a meal?

00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.640
I’m not sure if I have time.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:00.600
It’s alright.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.520
Whenever that’s convenient for you.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.400
Maybe next time, or even the next.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.880
Just please don’t turn me down.

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.840
It’s a bit damp, but please take it.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:37.360
I’d better go.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.240
Goodnight.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:41.240
Goodnight.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:18.600
TIM THANIN CHAIYANUWAT

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:28.320
“THE HANDSOME AND YUMMY
ARCHITECT”

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.280
Of all the posts I accidentally liked…

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.320
What is he going to think of me?

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.760
ONE WEEK LATER

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.680
My goal in this trimester is

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:28.360
to attract popular brands online
as our main selling point

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.600
to create a flow in our mall’s traffic.

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.360
If you have any more questions,
I’m only one call away.

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.120
Thank you.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:40.680
Thank you for trusting me.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.160
Mr. Pai.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.200
Mr. Pai.

00:18:58.920 --> 00:18:59.560
Mr. Pai, sir.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:00.000
Yes?

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.680
The new zone we’ve been planning,
where would you like it to be?

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:04.840
On the first floor.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.120
Let’s take a look at it, shall we?

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.480
Nana, why don’t you take them there?

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:11.240
I’ll be right behind you.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:13.320
Of course.

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.440
This way, please.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:20.920
TWO WEEKS LATER

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:24.320
On today’s agenda, at 10 p.m.,
you have a meeting with the foreign board.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.040
At 3 p.m., you have a meeting
with a client at our Sathon branch.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.480
At 5 p.m., there's dinner with
Ms. Ae’s marketing team.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.520
- Yes.
- And at 8 p.m—

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:41.520
Mr. Tim.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:43.400
Excuse me for a moment.

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.760
Oh, Mr. CEO.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.400
Are you here to see a client?

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:53.800
You can tell?

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:58.240
I’m sorry I didn’t say hello the other day.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.840
It just so happened that the client
I was with was interested in a project.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.640
We had to hurry back
to sign some contract.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:03.760
It’s alright.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.600
I was talking to some partners as well.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:06.680
Hold on…

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.520
Since we run into each other like this,

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:11.640
it would be alright for me to remind you
of your promise, right?

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.640
Promise?

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:19.560
You promised you’d buy me dinner because you made me fall—

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:20.360
Of course!

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:27.080
Of course.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:29.000
Alright.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.560
I have a degree in architecture
from Bartlett, UCL.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.480
My family isn’t wealthy, though.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
My parents just wanted me
to have a good education.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.360
I had to get a job right away
to pay them back for all the troubles.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:58.720
Mr. Tim.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:00.440
What’s the matter?

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.880
Oh, no.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:05.320
I’m alright.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:10.040
It’s just… family matters are kind of
a sensitive topic for me.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.120
I’m an only child.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.280
So my parents want the best for me.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.960
But that’s a lot of pressure, you know?

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.800
It’s like I’m carrying their
hopes and dreams on my shoulders.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:01.720
I have to go.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:02.960
Nana is calling me.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.400
It’s time for me to go as well.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:17.600
Mr. Tim, please wait.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:18.480
Yes?

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.520
This is my personal contact.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.280
Well…

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.280
Would it be alright if I contact you romantically?

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.200
Be my guest.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.480
Well, I did ask.

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.480
ONE MONTH LATER

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:06.120
THREE MONTHS LATER

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.040
Why are you smiling?

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.160
Nothing.

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.440
Baby, please.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.720
I’m just teasing you.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:25.720
Baby!

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:31.440
FIVE MONTHS LATER

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.640
I thought you could do better.

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:50.280
I know I’m not good enough for Pai.

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.600
And I’m sure you said
what you said just now

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.960
out of love and care for Pai.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.480
But I will prove to you all

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.280
that I love Pai

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:03.440
that I love Pai
no less than anyone in his family does.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.280
You’re perfect for Pai, Tim.

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.000
Thank you.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:52.480
Baby.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:53.280
Hmm?

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.640
Will you come with me to see Kuea
tomorrow at noon?

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:00.400
Baby.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.600
Did you forget our appointment?

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.160
You agreed we’d see my friends.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:11.040
I’m sorry.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.640
I guess I got the dates mixed up.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:16.400
It’s alright.

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.400
I’ll reschedule with my friends.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:21.840
Thank you for understanding me.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:27.640
Wait, baby.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.160
Who’s Kuea?

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:41.160
Hey, Kuea. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:42.120
Hi, Pai.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:44.840
Hello.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:45.440
Hello.

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:47.440
Come on in.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:57.840
Thank you for coming all the way here
to take a look at my project, Pai.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.760
I can’t miss your big moment, can I?

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.120
How are things?

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.800
Ever since taking over this project
from my family,

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.160
it’s been nothing short of chaotic.

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.680
But with a grandfather like yours,

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:12.240
I guess you understand.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:14.840
I guess so.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.720
What do we have here?

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:20.440
Have you been dating him long?

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.600
It’s been about a year.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:24.560
Wow.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:26.560
Well?

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:27.880
Are you happy?

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.680
I am crazy happy.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.680
If you’re happy, then I’m happy.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.080
You and Kuea seem like
really good friends.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:51.200
I don’t usually see you
so comfortable with anyone like that.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.760
I’ve known him since middle school.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.000
What did he want with us today?

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:02.960
His family has been hinting that they want
me to invest with them for a while.

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:04.840
I showed up today as a good gesture.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.520
You’re dating me, so you might need to
get used to something like this.

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:10.520
Aww.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:14.680
Are you tired, darling?

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.960
Well, I’ll take care of the baby today.

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:19.720
Hmm?

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.040
Isn’t he cute?

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.040
Baby, is everything okay?

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.040
Baby.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.280
Do you ever think about having children?

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:16.800
You want kids?

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:19.880
I don’t know.

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:24.360
But I can totally imagine
how our family would look if we had some.

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.560
So can I.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:39.400
Tim.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.080
Do you want to marry me?

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:46.640
Uhh..

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:48.440
I…

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:49.760
Never mind.

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.280
Just thought I’d ask.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:56.280
It’s…

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.080
Wait a moment.

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.160
This is my mother’s ring.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.040
She gave it to me
before I went to London.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.040
I was going to ask you…

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.120
But I was afraid you’d think
it was too soon.

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.000
But if you want to get married…

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.200
Will you marry me?

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.120
Yes, I will.

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.000
(I’m actually not big on shopping malls.)

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:39.840
DON’T HAVE SEX TOO OFTEN!
(I’m actually not big on shopping malls.)

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:41.720
(If I have to go to a shopping mall,
I prefer closing hours.)

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:43.000
DO NOT THINK PAI IS CUTE!
(If I have to go to a shopping mall,
I prefer closing hours.)

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:46.960
PROPOSE.
(I’ve never thought about marriage.)

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.960
(But maybe I’ll change my mind
when I find the one.)

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:54.160
PROPOSE.

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:09.600
DO NOT FALL FOR THE TARGET
AT ALL COSTS!

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.240
What’s wrong?

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:29.400
I’m asking you what’s wrong.

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.680
Can you stop making me
worried about you?

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.160
I just broke up with someone.

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:41.280
So it’s just that…

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.160
Go take a shower right now.

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:46.560
Aren’t you even gonna
feel a little sorry for me?

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:48.760
What is there for me to feel sorry for?

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.640
I told you, North, that it was not going to
work with someone like that.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.960
It’s your fault that
you’re not a good judge of character.

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.200
What business
do you have with me today, Pai?

00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:00.640
Or did you come all the way here
just here to make me feel worse?

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.080
I’ll tell you some other time.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.800
What? Just tell me.

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:07.880
You’re heartbroken.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.680
I don’t think this is the right time.

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:11.360
Ugh, just spill it.

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:18.960
Tim and I are getting married.

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.040
Really?

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:22.760
You are?

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:35.360
Come on, North.

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.680
Go take a shower and get dressed.

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.160
Take yourself out there to see the world.

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:43.400
Don’t make me worry about you.

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.520
You’re an adult now, you know?

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:53.920
Well…

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:56.040
Congratulations.

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.120
Thanks.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:06.800
What’s the matter?

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:12.360
I’m just curious…

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:17.560
When did you know
you wanted to marry Tim?

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.680
I just know I want to be with him every day.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.800
I know every problem will turn out okay
as long as we go through it together.

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:35.520
When you can’t stop thinking
about your future with someone,

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.560
I guess that’s when you marry them.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.080
I have to go to work.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.920
Put yourself out there into the world.

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.600
Take Pure with you if you must.

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:50.480
Do that for me as a favor.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.320
Okay. Fine.

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:57.680
Just go.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:58.840
You’re gonna be late.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:00.360
Don’t forget to take a shower.

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:01.600
Who’d forget that?

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:08.840
(Hello?)

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.560
Hello, Pure.

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.120
Where are you?

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.080
(I’m at Ikea.)

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.440
(I’m buying supplies for the bakery.)

00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:17.480
Let’s go somewhere.

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:19.360
I wanna go hiking.

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:20.240
(Sure.)

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:21.040
(When?)

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.640
In two hours.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.960
(Dude, I’m not in Thailand.)

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.240
Oh? But you said you were at Ikea.

00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:31.600
(Yes, in Stockholm, Sweden.)

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.560
Did you have to go all the way
to Sweden for that?

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:35.600
(Yes, I did.)

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.400
(The products I want
are only available here.)

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:38.840
(Can’t you just wait for me to come back?)

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.720
Dude, I want to go today.

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:42.880
(Hang tight.)

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.240
(I’ll be back in seven days.)

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.000
Seven days…

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:55.800
Seven.

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:57.560
Six.

00:34:58.560 --> 00:34:59.360
Five.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:00.600
Four.

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.240
Three.

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:04.360
Two.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:05.920
One.

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.560
I can’t take it anymore!

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.320
Oh, crap!

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:18.680
Crap!

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:20.240
Hey.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.800
Are you alright?

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:07.480
Hold on. I’ll come get you.

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:26.800
Hey.

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:28.520
I think

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.120
you need to take your shirt off.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:31.880
Put this on instead.

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:33.400
You don’t want to get sick, do you?

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:35.160
It’s alright.

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.360
I’m not really cold.

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:40.080
Come on.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.720
Go on.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:13.920
Oh, okay.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.160
Hey, what’s your name?

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:17.000
My name is U.

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:22.720
It’s North.

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.120
I’m done changing.

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:41.280
North, are you okay, though?

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:42.760
You took quite a plunge into that river.

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:43.760
Are you hurt?

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.080
I’m all fine.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.080
Let me check anyway.

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:48.120
Oh.

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:49.920
Excuse me.

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:50.600
Sure.

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:53.320
Let me see.

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:54.960
What about here?

00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:57.680
Allow me.

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:02.720
Oh.

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:03.480
Crap.

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:10.160
Excuse me.

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:24.600
This is bad.

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:29.520
I think you should rest here.

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:32.160
We’ll keep walking when you’re better.

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:32.960
What do you think?

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:40.560
What about your stuff?

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:43.080
They must be drenched.

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.600
I’ll leave them out to dry in the sun.

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:09.200
It’s dead, huh?

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:15.880
He treated me so badly.

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.920
I’m in shambles, really.

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:23.520
But I realized I shouldn’t spend so much
time being miserable over some guy.

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:24.440
Right?

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:28.160
Actually, I asked Pure
to come hiking with me.

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:29.800
But he was busy.

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:33.400
So I thought, “Fine, I’ll go by myself!”

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:34.720
“I ain’t gonna die in the woods.”

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.040
But then…

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.840
It’s been barely half a day, and here I am.

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.200
What about you?

00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:00.880
Oh, I was just bored.

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:03.080
Thought it would be nice
to go out for once.

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:06.720
Maybe I’d see something
nice and beautiful, you know?

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.160
I’m sorry, then.

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:13.920
You’re stuck with me so I doubt
you’ll see anything nice or beautiful.

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.440
Well…

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.400
I wouldn’t say that.

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:40.240
I think we should hurry up
and get out of the forest.

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.000
It’s getting late.

00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.520
Can you even walk?

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:47.360
I have no choice, do I?

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:51.320
Alright.

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.840
Let me help.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.400
Careful.

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:19.240
Is it far off, U?

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:21.040
I don’t know.

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:28.960
Hold on.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.640
We’ve been through here five times.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.720
I think we’re really lost, North.

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:47.320
North?

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.080
What should we do?

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.240
I want to go home.

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:20.720
If we get out of here,

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:23.440
what is the first thing you want to do?

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:32.520
I’m not even sure we’ll find our way home.

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:37.400
But if we’re out of here,
I’ll eat everything I want.

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:38.600
I won’t even worry about sodium bloating.

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:41.280
I’ll just order everything
in my shopping cart,

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:42.200
and open them all in one sitting!

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:45.360
Every game I haven’t finished playing,
I will finish them all!

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:47.520
Even when Pai tries to stop me,

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.080
I’ll tell him,

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.720
“Leave. Me. Alone!”

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:06.160
Honestly, when I really think about it,

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:07.560
there are so many things I regret.

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:12.320
From now on,

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:15.280
when there’s a good opportunity for me
or when I want to do something,

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:18.600
I won’t wait for the right time.

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:23.600
What about you?

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.120
What do you want to do if you get out?

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.600
Me? (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:30.760
I want a family.

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:34.040
I’m tired of being alone.

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:36.720
When you’re on your own too long,

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:40.400
it honestly gets lonely.

00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:43.600
You’re not taken?

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:46.000
No, I’m not.

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:47.960
Haven't met the right one yet.

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:52.360
Don’t even know
what that person’s going to be like.

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.840
I’m curious about that as well.

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.320
I was just asking Pai about this.

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:06.800
He said I’ll know when I know.

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.520
But to tell you the truth, I still don’t get it.

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:14.240
It’s not like you take one look at someone

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:15.720
and know right away
that they’re your soulmate.

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:17.120
Right?

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:48.600
Uh…

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:51.600
Let me see.

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:56.840
Oh, North, I think you have a fever.

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:02.640
I’ll be fine.

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:04.520
Allow me.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.640
I didn’t say you’re allowed.

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:29.160
Oh.

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:31.360
Sorry.

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:33.480
It’s alright.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.200
Hey, you there.

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:10.160
Hey.

00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:14.360
Oh!

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:15.600
U!

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.080
We’ll be fine!

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:18.760
Help me up, please.

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:19.600
Help me up.

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:22.800
We’re gonna make it, U!

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.840
Okay.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:26.800
North.

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:50.440
Thank you, U.

00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:53.760
I thought I was gonna die in the forest.

00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:56.080
You’re exaggerating.

00:47:56.480 --> 00:48:00.480
I was told we were less than 100 meters
away from the main trail.

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:02.440
But it felt so real.

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:05.120
I thought I was going to die there.

00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:09.920
Good thing you were there with me.

00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:15.360
I was happy to be there with you, too.

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:25.160
Here.

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:33.000
I saw it in the coin machine and thought it was adorable so I got one for you.

00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:36.600
It’s just something to remember me by.

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:46.560
I guess this is where we say goodbye.

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:53.160
U.

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:00.600
Can I have your contact?

00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:24.000
Here.

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:25.360
Alright.

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:51.080
I’ll… keep in touch.

00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:53.120
Alright.

00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:24.320
(When did you know
you wanted to marry Tim?)

00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:28.440
I just know I want to be with him every day.

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:31.720
(I know everything will be fine
as long as we go through it together.)

00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:35.920
(When you can’t stop thinking
about your future with someone,)

00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:37.560
(I guess that’s when you marry them.)

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:53.640
SRI YAN MEATBALLS

00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:54.760
U!

00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:58.120
North?

00:50:58.520 --> 00:50:59.760
How did you find me?

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:00.880
Let’s talk about that later.

00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:02.920
I have something important to ask you.

00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:06.240
Yes?

00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:07.760
Since I got back from the hike,

00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:09.120
I keep thinking to myself that

00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:10.640
if I were to really die,

00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:12.600
what I would regret.

00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:14.440
The only thing I can think about

00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:15.960
is you.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.400
I know it sounds completely crazy.

00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:21.440
But I just don’t want
to waste any more time.

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:24.160
U.

00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:26.160
Will you marry me?

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:28.640
What?

00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:35.000
But I… have nothing, North,

00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:36.480
only the clothes on my back.

00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:39.360
I don’t deserve someone like you.

00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:41.320
I don’t care about money.

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:43.360
I already have everything.

00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:45.920
I don’t want anything else from you.

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:47.120
But—

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:47.760
How about this?

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:50.040
If you agree to marry me,

00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:56.080
I’m giving this to you.

00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:57.640
Consider it my dowry.

00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:09.720
Will you marry me?

00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:26.800
Are there any witnesses with you today?

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:30.840
There they are.

00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:41.440
Sign here, please.

00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:42.160
Yes.

00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:49.360
Your turn, U.

00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:50.080
Alright.

00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:00.760
Jeeramongkolthanun…

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:02.120
Yes?

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:04.680
Oh, no.

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:05.800
It’s nothing.

00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:07.240
Alright.

00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:11.600
All done.

00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:34.040
250 million!

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:45.680
Jeeramongkolthanun.

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:49.200
Why does that sound so familiar?

00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:56.120
JEERAMONKOLTHANUN

00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:59.000
THE FAMILY BEHIND
TEN BILLION-WORTH BUSINESSES

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:02.720
Crap!

00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:05.320
Ten billion?

00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:09.200
Crap.

00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:11.680
Oh, wow!

00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:17.760
THE FAMILY BEHIND
TEN BILLION-WORTH BUSINESSES

00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:20.840
Yes!

00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:24.200
THE FAMILY BEHIND
TEN BILLION-WORTH BUSINESSES

00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:25.640
HOW TO FIND A RICH PARTNER

00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:27.200
2) HANG AROUND RICH PEOPLE

00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:28.960
GO TO PLACES RICH PEOPLE LOVE,
LIKE NATURE HIKES.

00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:39.840
Hey, baby.

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:41.120
You’re home.

00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:45.160
Uh, yes.

00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:54.120
What’s wrong?

00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:56.960
Nothing.

00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:59.840
You haven’t taken a shower, baby.

00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:02.400
I’m about to—

00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:04.480
I…

00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:05.920
I’ll hop in the bath real quick.

00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:15.400
Do not fall in love with the target.

00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:17.280
Do not fall in love with the target.

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:19.080
Do not fall in love with the target.

00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:29.080
When did you get in?

00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:32.240
Just now.

00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:35.120
I didn’t want to wait to use the bathroom
so I thought we could do it together.

00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:40.480
What’s wrong?

00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:41.320
Are you being shy?

00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:43.840
No.

00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:45.920
I’m just afraid
I won’t be able to hold back—

00:55:57.400 --> 00:55:58.480
Why should you?

00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:00.640
We’re going to be married soon.

00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:10.560
DO NOT THINK PAI IS CUTE!

00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:11.400
DO NOT FALL FOR THE TARGET
AT ALL COSTS!

00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:16.640
DO NOT FALL FOR THE TARGET
AT ALL COSTS!

00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:21.920
To hell with it, then.

00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:51.440
Confess right now.

00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:52.400
You know about this?

00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:54.560
Get our attorney
to divorce them right away!

00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:56.480
You dropped this.

00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:57.400
I found it.

00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:00.800
Do you happen to pick up
a lot of lost wallets?

00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:04.080
Maybe I really don’t know you well enough.

00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:06.600
We can start right now.

00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:10.440
If marriage really was between two people,
it would be nice, right?

00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:12.040
I want to get married right now.

00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:14.080
Tim!
