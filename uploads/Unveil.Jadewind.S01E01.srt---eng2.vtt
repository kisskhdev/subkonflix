WEBVTT

00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:13.625
I am Li Peiyi, Princess of Fuchang County.

00:00:15.825 --> 00:00:19.105
Pampered since childhood,
I lived in safety and peace.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:21.265
On the Lantern Festival when I was nine,

00:00:21.345 --> 00:00:23.705
I watched lantern lights tint
the Western Capital's night red,

00:00:23.785 --> 00:00:27.505
unaware that that night,
my home would be drenched in blood.

00:00:27.585 --> 00:00:29.065
They all said

00:00:29.145 --> 00:00:31.705
that my father, Prince of Duan,
a man with famed victories,

00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:33.745
went mad, slaughtered our family,

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:35.145
then took his own life to atone.

00:00:35.225 --> 00:00:37.865
I alone survived, safe within the palace.

00:00:38.425 --> 00:00:40.345
Some pitied me,
for I was orphaned so young.

00:00:40.425 --> 00:00:42.705
Others called me an ill-starred jinx.

00:00:42.785 --> 00:00:44.305
But they did not know

00:00:45.065 --> 00:00:46.345
how upright and kind my father was.

00:00:46.425 --> 00:00:48.425
He would never commit such a crime.

00:00:49.025 --> 00:00:52.105
His Majesty pitied me,
took me into the palace, and raised me.

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:55.105
Yet the royal palace,
however grand, is not my home.

00:00:55.185 --> 00:00:58.585
And imperial grace,
however great, is not a parent's love.

00:00:58.665 --> 00:01:01.305
Behind palace walls,
one misstep means ruin.

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:04.185
So I buried love and hatred in my bones,

00:01:04.785 --> 00:01:07.505
hid my edge, and waited for my moment.

00:01:08.825 --> 00:01:10.345
I asked to join
the Palace Investigation Bureau

00:01:10.425 --> 00:01:12.185
and learned to investigate cases

00:01:12.265 --> 00:01:14.665
so that I could win justice
for those wronged

00:01:14.745 --> 00:01:16.465
across the realm.

00:01:16.545 --> 00:01:20.345
I care nothing for public scorn,
rules, proprieties,

00:01:20.425 --> 00:01:22.625
or even life and death.

00:01:22.705 --> 00:01:24.505
If my life is fated to be an offering,

00:01:24.585 --> 00:01:26.785
then let blood debts be paid with blood.

00:02:45.145 --> 00:02:50.785
{\an8}ADAPTED FROM A SHUQI.COM NOVEL
ORIGINAL AUTHOR: SENLIN LU

00:03:28.185 --> 00:03:32.705
{\an8}GRAVE OF BELOVED DAUGHTER, XIE QIAOLIAN

00:04:24.865 --> 00:04:27.905
Son, I've found you a bride

00:04:27.985 --> 00:04:30.745
whose Four Pillars of Destiny match yours.

00:04:31.265 --> 00:04:33.945
Oh, my poor son.

00:04:53.625 --> 00:04:54.945
It… It's the bride!

00:05:10.865 --> 00:05:12.425
{\an8}LATE BRIDE XIE QIAOLIAN
LATE SON GUO SHIDA

00:05:13.705 --> 00:05:17.545
You disturbed my peace and dug up my body,

00:05:21.265 --> 00:05:24.425
and now you want me
to serve your dead son?

00:05:24.505 --> 00:05:27.025
Aren't you afraid
I'll come haunt you at night?

00:05:33.065 --> 00:05:35.945
Since you love trafficking with the dead,

00:05:37.025 --> 00:05:39.105
and you can't bear to part with your son,

00:05:40.265 --> 00:05:41.265
why not…

00:05:45.505 --> 00:05:47.465
go down and keep him company?

00:05:47.545 --> 00:05:48.585
She has a shadow!

00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:52.145
She's human, not a ghost!

00:05:53.105 --> 00:05:54.785
You're human, not a ghost!

00:05:56.825 --> 00:05:58.825
I wish I were a ghost.

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:03.225
Guo Ruilin, Minister of State Ceremonial,

00:06:03.865 --> 00:06:05.465
take a good look at me. Who am I?

00:06:05.545 --> 00:06:06.785
GUO RUILIN, MINISTER OF STATE CEREMONIAL

00:06:06.865 --> 00:06:07.705
You…

00:06:11.265 --> 00:06:13.105
You're the Princess of Fuchang County!

00:06:13.185 --> 00:06:16.665
Today, I'm Li Peiyi of the Inner Guards.

00:06:22.585 --> 00:06:24.145
Lately, unmarried women's bodies

00:06:24.225 --> 00:06:26.825
in the Western Capital have been stolen
from their graves.

00:06:26.905 --> 00:06:29.305
We've caught plenty
of petty grave robbers,

00:06:30.505 --> 00:06:32.665
but the real monster
behind it all hides too deeply

00:06:32.745 --> 00:06:34.185
and is hard to catch.

00:06:35.905 --> 00:06:38.145
You even dared steal the body
of an official's daughter.

00:06:39.025 --> 00:06:40.385
How bold.

00:06:41.865 --> 00:06:46.465
Minister Guo, you colluded with criminals
to steal a woman's body

00:06:47.065 --> 00:06:49.305
and arranged a ghost marriage illegally.

00:06:50.225 --> 00:06:52.505
Guo Ruilin, do you plead guilty?

00:06:56.465 --> 00:06:58.345
I can confess.

00:06:58.425 --> 00:07:02.025
But to convict a person,

00:07:02.105 --> 00:07:04.585
you need witnesses and proof, right?

00:07:05.865 --> 00:07:06.745
Tell me, Your Ladyship,

00:07:07.505 --> 00:07:09.785
what are you using to convict me?

00:07:09.865 --> 00:07:12.225
You stole Xie Qiaolian's body.

00:07:15.825 --> 00:07:17.865
Your Ladyship, are you joking?

00:07:17.945 --> 00:07:21.465
Where is Xie Qiaolian's body?

00:07:23.425 --> 00:07:24.585
I see.

00:07:25.505 --> 00:07:29.385
There's no physical evidence,
and I'm the only witness.

00:07:31.865 --> 00:07:35.465
So, Minister Guo,
you plan to make this ugly, don't you?

00:07:35.545 --> 00:07:37.065
You leave me with no choice.

00:07:37.145 --> 00:07:37.985
Get her!

00:08:01.585 --> 00:08:03.785
Minister Guo, you've gone senile.

00:08:03.865 --> 00:08:06.185
I'm not just good at solving cases.

00:08:06.265 --> 00:08:07.105
I can fight as well.

00:08:26.985 --> 00:08:30.145
Your Ladyship is young,
but you're also getting confused.

00:08:30.745 --> 00:08:34.225
You must've forgotten
that to fake your death,

00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:35.825
you took a Breath-Stopping Pill.

00:08:36.345 --> 00:08:39.345
Exerting yourself after waking

00:08:39.425 --> 00:08:41.225
has badly drained your strength.

00:08:43.705 --> 00:08:45.465
Looks like my luck's run out today.

00:08:46.865 --> 00:08:48.745
But Minister Guo,
maybe you should think again.

00:08:49.745 --> 00:08:52.825
After all, killing a county princess
is no small matter.

00:08:53.585 --> 00:08:55.345
I never wanted trouble like this.

00:08:55.905 --> 00:08:59.745
Blame your sharp mind and your arrogance.

00:09:01.465 --> 00:09:05.265
When I play, I play big.
That's where the fun is.

00:09:05.345 --> 00:09:06.265
Get her.

00:09:09.905 --> 00:09:12.865
Since Your Ladyship wants to play big,

00:09:14.305 --> 00:09:16.105
- I'll oblige.
- Stand up.

00:09:22.265 --> 00:09:24.745
What's the fun in burying a dead person?

00:09:24.825 --> 00:09:28.345
A live burial is much more satisfying.

00:09:35.305 --> 00:09:36.145
Minister Guo,

00:09:37.225 --> 00:09:41.265
when I become a ghost,
I'll come for you all.

00:09:46.385 --> 00:09:49.385
How do we pin her soul down

00:09:49.905 --> 00:09:52.145
so she can't come back to haunt us?

00:09:56.545 --> 00:09:57.385
What are you doing?

00:10:00.065 --> 00:10:02.945
Burying you alive
will breed much resentment.

00:10:03.025 --> 00:10:06.185
We'll drive these peach
wood nails into your body

00:10:06.705 --> 00:10:11.105
to keep you from wandering after death.

00:10:16.705 --> 00:10:18.105
MA XIAORAN, INNER GUARD
PALACE INVESTIGATION BUREAU

00:10:18.985 --> 00:10:21.265
Her Ladyship's been
in there nearly one hour.

00:10:22.665 --> 00:10:24.065
Oh no, she's in danger.

00:10:24.145 --> 00:10:24.865
WUREN, DISCIPLINARY OFFICER
PALACE INVESTIGATION BUREAU

00:10:24.945 --> 00:10:26.265
To the outer quarters!

00:10:26.345 --> 00:10:27.385
Move!

00:10:32.625 --> 00:10:34.625
- Save her first. Catch them second.
- Understood.

00:10:51.545 --> 00:10:52.385
There's nothing here.

00:10:52.465 --> 00:10:53.385
Let's go.

00:11:10.305 --> 00:11:12.145
That's the Princess of Fuchang County.

00:11:12.225 --> 00:11:13.865
What if someone comes looking for her?

00:11:14.945 --> 00:11:16.265
Don't be afraid, darling.

00:11:17.145 --> 00:11:19.825
Having just lost our son,

00:11:20.865 --> 00:11:23.745
we've both been unwell
and haven't left the house.

00:11:23.825 --> 00:11:27.385
What could she have to do with us?

00:11:27.905 --> 00:11:30.745
But the Inner Guards
already went to our family graveyard.

00:11:31.785 --> 00:11:33.425
So what?

00:11:35.505 --> 00:11:39.265
They found no one there.

00:11:39.985 --> 00:11:42.465
And the outer quarters
have been cleaned spotless.

00:11:42.545 --> 00:11:43.905
As for her body,

00:11:44.825 --> 00:11:47.305
they'll never find it.

00:11:54.905 --> 00:11:57.185
If you have last words, say them.

00:11:59.225 --> 00:12:00.705
Since the rites are complete,

00:12:00.785 --> 00:12:01.945
Father,

00:12:02.985 --> 00:12:04.185
Mother,

00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:06.105
I'll be sure to repay
your "kindness" properly.

00:12:06.945 --> 00:12:07.785
Close the coffin. Close it!

00:12:13.065 --> 00:12:14.225
Hurry.

00:12:28.945 --> 00:12:30.625
Don't be afraid, darling.

00:12:30.705 --> 00:12:32.025
That short-lived wretch

00:12:32.105 --> 00:12:35.465
has probably crossed
the Bridge of Oblivion by now.

00:12:46.825 --> 00:12:48.945
Ghost! A ghost!

00:12:54.545 --> 00:12:57.545
Father, Mother,

00:12:59.145 --> 00:13:00.265
we meet again.

00:13:02.305 --> 00:13:05.265
Guards! Guards!

00:13:06.745 --> 00:13:09.065
Your manor has been surrounded
by the Palace Investigation Bureau.

00:13:09.145 --> 00:13:10.945
Minister Guo, there's nowhere left to run.

00:13:17.625 --> 00:13:18.585
You…

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:20.225
Your Ladyship.

00:13:21.425 --> 00:13:22.745
Your Ladyship?

00:13:23.385 --> 00:13:24.345
Your Ladyship!

00:13:26.825 --> 00:13:29.385
JUSTICE AND IMPARTIALITY

00:13:42.105 --> 00:13:45.825
You drove four peach wood nails into me,
so I gave you four sword strikes.

00:13:45.905 --> 00:13:47.225
Fair, isn't it?

00:13:48.265 --> 00:13:50.105
You're truly hard to kill.

00:13:51.225 --> 00:13:54.145
Back then, everyone else
in your family was killed.

00:13:54.225 --> 00:13:56.585
Only you survived.

00:13:56.665 --> 00:13:59.785
And today, buried alive in a coffin,

00:14:00.305 --> 00:14:02.585
you still couldn't die.

00:14:11.265 --> 00:14:12.145
Let's go.

00:14:51.665 --> 00:14:53.585
Your Ladyship? Your Ladyship!

00:14:53.665 --> 00:14:54.665
- Your Ladyship!
- Your Ladyship!

00:15:00.745 --> 00:15:04.265
Minister Guo still doesn't even know
what he's guilty of.

00:15:05.185 --> 00:15:07.745
Of course I know the ghost-marriage charge
won't bring you down.

00:15:08.465 --> 00:15:11.025
But now your charge
is attempted murder of a county princess.

00:15:11.825 --> 00:15:13.585
How do you think
His Majesty will deal with you?

00:15:14.665 --> 00:15:15.705
You…

00:15:16.665 --> 00:15:18.825
You let yourself fall into my hands?

00:15:19.505 --> 00:15:21.225
You wanted me to bury you alive?

00:15:21.825 --> 00:15:24.185
Her Ladyship took
the Breath-Stopping Pill herself.

00:15:24.265 --> 00:15:25.825
How could she forget?

00:15:32.465 --> 00:15:33.665
Your Ladyship,

00:15:34.345 --> 00:15:37.385
if I can help with the marriage alliance

00:15:37.985 --> 00:15:40.705
involving the Fifteenth Princess,

00:15:43.265 --> 00:15:45.385
could you spare my life?

00:15:49.265 --> 00:15:50.265
Take him away!

00:15:51.625 --> 00:15:52.825
Your Ladyship…

00:15:53.345 --> 00:15:54.745
Your Ladyship!

00:15:55.345 --> 00:15:56.745
Your Ladyship!

00:15:57.705 --> 00:16:00.025
About the Fifteenth Princess's
marriage alliance,

00:16:00.105 --> 00:16:01.665
I'm afraid there's really
nothing we can do.

00:16:02.625 --> 00:16:04.705
Look into that Uyghur prince.

00:16:04.785 --> 00:16:05.865
Yes.

00:16:11.745 --> 00:16:12.865
Your Ladyship,

00:16:13.865 --> 00:16:16.425
to solve a case,
you got yourself hurt so badly again.

00:16:16.945 --> 00:16:18.025
Was it really worth it?

00:16:20.505 --> 00:16:23.625
I solved such a big case.
Of course it was.

00:16:49.305 --> 00:16:52.305
A guest star appeared in the Girl mansion
at the start of Xuanxiao…

00:16:52.385 --> 00:16:53.225
XIAO HUAIJIN
DEPUTY DIRECTOR, ASTRONOMICAL BUREAU

00:16:53.305 --> 00:16:56.105
…and has lingered for over a month,
its color blue-black.

00:16:56.185 --> 00:16:57.585
ZHU QING, SCRIBE, ASTRONOMICAL BUREAU

00:16:58.545 --> 00:16:59.385
Write it down.

00:17:20.865 --> 00:17:22.025
This is a most ominous sign.

00:17:22.105 --> 00:17:25.224
"If it is not one's duty,
one must not meddle."

00:17:26.704 --> 00:17:28.345
His Majesty set that rule long ago.

00:17:29.025 --> 00:17:29.905
An astronomer

00:17:30.945 --> 00:17:33.305
must not divine or judge.

00:17:33.865 --> 00:17:37.785
GUEST STAR IN GIRL MANSION

00:17:37.865 --> 00:17:38.825
LANTERN FESTIVAL, 13TH YEAR OF DALI

00:17:38.905 --> 00:17:41.625
On the Lantern Festival
in the 13th year of Dali,

00:17:41.705 --> 00:17:45.585
an Uyghur prince arrives in the Capital
to wed the Fifteenth Princess.

00:17:47.865 --> 00:17:51.385
His Majesty and Consort Shu arrive!

00:17:51.465 --> 00:17:53.345
HANYUAN HALL

00:18:02.545 --> 00:18:04.665
THE EMPEROR

00:18:04.745 --> 00:18:06.585
Long live Your Majesty!

00:18:06.665 --> 00:18:08.305
Consort Shu, may you have eternal joy!

00:18:09.665 --> 00:18:11.945
You may rise.

00:18:21.305 --> 00:18:22.785
YAOLUOGE WUTELE, UYGHUR PRINCE

00:18:29.745 --> 00:18:31.545
WANSHUN, THE FIFTEENTH PRINCESS

00:18:40.225 --> 00:18:42.065
Heed His Majesty's decree!

00:18:45.745 --> 00:18:46.945
Since the Han dynasty,
we have upheld amity

00:18:47.545 --> 00:18:48.785
with frontier states through marriage.

00:18:48.865 --> 00:18:52.265
The Uyghur admire our virtue,
and our friendship deepens by the day.

00:18:52.345 --> 00:18:55.945
Our court approves this
and hereby forges a marriage alliance

00:18:56.025 --> 00:18:59.545
in accord with historical precedent
and the established rites.

00:18:59.625 --> 00:19:03.745
Princess Li is gentle by nature
and proper in conduct,

00:19:03.825 --> 00:19:06.745
her virtues evident and complete…

00:19:06.825 --> 00:19:07.945
What a beautiful dagger.

00:19:08.945 --> 00:19:10.065
It's for you.

00:19:10.905 --> 00:19:12.505
Remember what I taught you?

00:19:14.865 --> 00:19:16.225
If that boy dares hurt you,

00:19:17.105 --> 00:19:21.025
stab him here, here, and here.

00:19:21.625 --> 00:19:23.585
It'll hurt him, but he won't die.

00:19:26.225 --> 00:19:27.905
These leaves are all gold.

00:19:28.425 --> 00:19:30.305
If you're ever in trouble,
pry them off and trade them for money.

00:19:31.545 --> 00:19:32.705
Don't worry.

00:19:33.825 --> 00:19:37.305
When have I ever received so many rewards?

00:19:37.825 --> 00:19:40.505
And when has anyone in the palace
ever paid me much mind?

00:19:40.585 --> 00:19:42.905
Though I'll be sent away
for this marriage alliance,

00:19:42.985 --> 00:19:44.585
I've earned a title.

00:19:45.105 --> 00:19:48.145
And Father will remember
he has a daughter like me.

00:19:48.225 --> 00:19:49.545
I'm content.

00:19:59.825 --> 00:20:02.145
These two gold bangles
make the prettiest pair.

00:20:03.305 --> 00:20:04.145
Let's each keep one.

00:20:05.985 --> 00:20:07.865
I've never taken a single step
beyond the Western Capital.

00:20:08.905 --> 00:20:12.625
This time, I get to see the world outside.

00:20:14.225 --> 00:20:15.185
I'm glad.

00:20:22.385 --> 00:20:25.385
To honor this decree
and foster harmony with our vassal,

00:20:25.465 --> 00:20:27.625
she shall wed according to the rites

00:20:27.705 --> 00:20:29.705
to strengthen amity
between the two states.

00:20:29.785 --> 00:20:32.025
She is hereby granted
the title of Princess Ningyuan

00:20:32.105 --> 00:20:33.905
and wedded to the Uyghur prince,

00:20:33.985 --> 00:20:36.305
Yaoluoge Wutele.

00:20:36.385 --> 00:20:37.465
Accept the decree!

00:20:45.305 --> 00:20:47.065
Father, thank you for your grace.

00:20:48.425 --> 00:20:50.345
Your Majesty, thank you for your favor.

00:21:10.745 --> 00:21:12.865
Let the feast begin!

00:21:43.185 --> 00:21:44.265
Mr. Xiao,

00:21:45.705 --> 00:21:46.905
His Majesty summons you.

00:22:03.185 --> 00:22:05.665
Why are you here, drinking alone?

00:22:05.745 --> 00:22:07.185
You're getting old.

00:22:07.265 --> 00:22:08.745
Even your footsteps make noise now.

00:22:08.825 --> 00:22:12.905
So this is how you treat your teacher now.

00:22:12.985 --> 00:22:16.585
Hurry up and teach me
all the best tricks you've been hiding.

00:22:17.785 --> 00:22:20.105
In a few years, I'll be taking your post.

00:22:20.185 --> 00:22:22.065
If you wait till then, it'll be too late.

00:22:22.145 --> 00:22:23.105
DU ZHIXING
INSPECTOR, PALACE INVESTIGATION BUREAU

00:22:23.185 --> 00:22:25.825
I never said you'd take my post.

00:22:27.145 --> 00:22:28.185
If not me, who?

00:22:28.865 --> 00:22:29.705
You?

00:22:29.785 --> 00:22:32.305
Your heart's not with
the Palace Investigation Bureau.

00:22:33.185 --> 00:22:35.305
But no one else is better than me
at solving cases.

00:22:36.305 --> 00:22:37.585
Which only proves

00:22:37.665 --> 00:22:40.345
you're better at doing the work
than leading people.

00:22:42.465 --> 00:22:43.905
What's the fun in leading people?

00:22:45.905 --> 00:22:50.225
You've been beating around the bush
all for this, haven't you?

00:22:50.305 --> 00:22:53.425
Now, a dance by Princess Ningyuan!

00:23:57.665 --> 00:24:00.865
Your Majesty, what's that over there?

00:24:22.305 --> 00:24:23.825
A yaksha!

00:24:24.905 --> 00:24:25.945
Protect His Majesty!

00:24:28.905 --> 00:24:30.585
- Protect His Majesty!
- Hurry!

00:24:35.825 --> 00:24:37.065
Your Majesty, come!

00:24:39.505 --> 00:24:41.745
- Quickly, keep up!
- Move! Keep up!

00:25:02.585 --> 00:25:03.865
Are you trying to die? I'll go!

00:25:07.465 --> 00:25:09.265
- Don't come over!
- Peiyi!

00:25:17.145 --> 00:25:19.225
There's oil in the bucket.
Use sand and soil!

00:25:19.305 --> 00:25:20.225
Understood!

00:26:06.465 --> 00:26:07.585
Your Ladyship,

00:26:08.545 --> 00:26:11.785
Her Highness's body was burned too badly.

00:26:12.585 --> 00:26:14.145
While you were unconscious,

00:26:14.225 --> 00:26:16.705
the Court of Imperial Sacrifices
sealed her remains in the Lower Palace.

00:26:17.225 --> 00:26:21.105
She'll be buried
after the true culprit is caught.

00:26:28.225 --> 00:26:30.585
These two gold bangles
make the prettiest pair.

00:26:31.705 --> 00:26:32.705
Let's each keep one.

00:26:53.665 --> 00:26:56.425
An imperial edict!

00:27:04.705 --> 00:27:06.385
Heed His Majesty's decree!

00:27:08.225 --> 00:27:10.665
On the Lantern Festival,
before the Son of Heaven,

00:27:10.745 --> 00:27:14.425
someone committed an atrocity
and murdered a princess.

00:27:14.505 --> 00:27:16.265
The Court of Judicial Review

00:27:16.345 --> 00:27:18.305
and the Palace Investigation Bureau
shall investigate at once.

00:27:18.385 --> 00:27:19.545
Accept the decree!

00:27:22.705 --> 00:27:23.745
I will take this case.

00:27:23.825 --> 00:27:25.065
Your Ladyship,

00:27:25.865 --> 00:27:28.185
you were close to Princess Ningyuan.

00:27:28.865 --> 00:27:32.025
This case should probably
be left to someone else.

00:27:32.105 --> 00:27:35.985
I said I'll take it.

00:27:41.665 --> 00:27:42.665
EUNUCH GUO

00:27:42.745 --> 00:27:45.545
Then we rely on you, Your Ladyship.

00:27:57.345 --> 00:28:00.825
None of the guests or palace staff
may leave the palace.

00:28:00.905 --> 00:28:03.025
Release them only after
their movements around the time

00:28:03.105 --> 00:28:04.105
of the incident are verified.

00:28:04.185 --> 00:28:05.145
Understood.

00:28:12.865 --> 00:28:14.905
The yaksha came from the southwest.

00:28:14.985 --> 00:28:18.185
Search the three buildings across the way.
Question those who were nearby.

00:28:18.265 --> 00:28:19.185
Yes.

00:28:23.465 --> 00:28:24.305
Your Ladyship,

00:28:24.385 --> 00:28:26.665
this gentleman was caught
in the southwest corridor.

00:28:26.745 --> 00:28:28.625
He was nearby when the yaksha flew past.

00:28:37.545 --> 00:28:38.385
Who are you?

00:28:41.825 --> 00:28:43.945
Xiao Huaijin, Deputy Director
of the Astronomical Bureau.

00:28:44.025 --> 00:28:45.145
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

00:29:00.785 --> 00:29:02.865
Your Ladyship, what should we do with him?

00:29:05.265 --> 00:29:06.465
What incense do you use?

00:29:08.225 --> 00:29:10.465
My mother made it. I don't know.

00:29:10.545 --> 00:29:13.225
Who did you say you were?

00:29:13.825 --> 00:29:16.585
Deputy Director
of the Astronomical Bureau, Xiao Huaijin.

00:29:17.345 --> 00:29:19.745
Is your father Xiao Wenyuan,
the Crown Prince's Grand Tutor?

00:29:21.025 --> 00:29:23.465
- Yes.
- Why did you leave the banquet?

00:29:24.465 --> 00:29:26.545
I felt unwell and went to change.

00:29:27.065 --> 00:29:28.825
That was a long detour just to change?

00:29:28.905 --> 00:29:31.025
Unfamiliar with the palace, I got lost.

00:29:32.905 --> 00:29:34.585
Why were you in the corridor
at the time of the incident?

00:29:35.545 --> 00:29:36.385
I just happened to pass by.

00:29:37.385 --> 00:29:38.225
Did you see anything?

00:29:40.785 --> 00:29:42.625
I saw the yaksha fly through the sky.

00:29:42.705 --> 00:29:44.865
The Imperial Guards stopped me
before I could get a clearer look.

00:29:50.905 --> 00:29:53.345
Shan rattan paper. Pine soot ink.

00:29:53.425 --> 00:29:54.945
Burned paper.

00:29:55.025 --> 00:29:55.865
What did you burn?

00:30:04.505 --> 00:30:05.425
Take him away.

00:30:05.505 --> 00:30:06.825
Keep him under watch.

00:30:06.905 --> 00:30:07.745
Yes.

00:30:18.345 --> 00:30:19.665
If Your Ladyship wants to solve the case,

00:30:19.745 --> 00:30:21.665
seek fire on stone and gold beneath wood.

00:30:22.505 --> 00:30:23.465
The answer lies within the hexagram.

00:30:27.425 --> 00:30:29.065
Enough tricks.

00:30:32.385 --> 00:30:34.305
- Take him away.
- Yes.

00:30:37.905 --> 00:30:38.985
Something's been found on Ruyi Pavilion.

00:31:05.705 --> 00:31:07.865
Just as I thought.

00:31:09.865 --> 00:31:11.105
This was used to anchor the yaksha?

00:31:13.265 --> 00:31:16.105
For this stunt,
they really went to a lot of trouble.

00:31:17.025 --> 00:31:18.105
Candle wax.

00:31:18.745 --> 00:31:19.905
Silk thread.

00:31:44.345 --> 00:31:45.425
This is it.

00:31:46.105 --> 00:31:48.025
This is the device
that dragged the yaksha kite over.

00:31:50.145 --> 00:31:51.465
When the candle
on the opposite side burned out,

00:31:51.545 --> 00:31:53.065
the silk thread holding the kite snapped.

00:31:53.145 --> 00:31:55.665
That triggered the mechanism here at once.

00:31:57.945 --> 00:32:01.105
Someone planned this carefully.
They wanted Wanshun dead.

00:32:02.465 --> 00:32:04.785
To have the yaksha rise
during the Princess's dance,

00:32:05.505 --> 00:32:07.185
the killer had to know
the program of the banquet,

00:32:07.265 --> 00:32:08.345
the exact time she would perform,

00:32:09.065 --> 00:32:12.905
set the device in advance,
and light the candle at the right moment.

00:32:13.585 --> 00:32:15.345
They must have been able
to move freely in the palace.

00:32:15.425 --> 00:32:18.945
The wax up there
would burn out in about half one hour.

00:32:20.025 --> 00:32:21.345
When the incident happened,

00:32:21.425 --> 00:32:22.945
the banquet had been going for three ke.

00:32:23.745 --> 00:32:26.945
That means the killer had to set up
the device about one ke

00:32:27.545 --> 00:32:29.665
before the banquet began
and light the candle.

00:32:29.745 --> 00:32:33.745
When the banquet began,
I saw Mr. Xiao up there.

00:32:38.185 --> 00:32:41.265
From the top of Ruyi Pavilion
to where you saw him,

00:32:41.345 --> 00:32:44.425
even someone highly skilled
would need at least two ke to make it.

00:32:44.505 --> 00:32:46.785
So it wasn't Mr. Xiao's doing.

00:32:47.665 --> 00:32:48.745
No.

00:32:50.225 --> 00:32:52.545
The top of Ruyi Pavilion is fire on stone,

00:32:53.385 --> 00:32:54.985
and there's gold beneath wood right here.

00:32:56.105 --> 00:32:58.385
His divination was spot-on.

00:32:59.425 --> 00:33:00.825
He must've seen something.

00:33:26.265 --> 00:33:28.105
May I have a brush and ink, please?

00:33:34.065 --> 00:33:37.545
The kite caught fire, dove at the stage,
and set the palace lanterns ablaze.

00:33:38.105 --> 00:33:39.025
No,

00:33:39.545 --> 00:33:42.185
the yaksha catching fire
was just for show.

00:33:42.745 --> 00:33:44.665
The fire on the stage did the killing.

00:33:45.545 --> 00:33:47.265
The palace lanterns
weren't lit by the kite.

00:33:55.225 --> 00:33:56.305
It's black powder.

00:33:57.945 --> 00:33:59.185
Too many impurities.

00:33:59.265 --> 00:34:01.185
It didn't belong to the court.

00:34:01.265 --> 00:34:02.105
It was likely privately made.

00:34:02.825 --> 00:34:06.585
So the time to set the stage on fire
was calculated in advance too.

00:34:07.825 --> 00:34:09.744
But the lanterns ringed the stage.

00:34:09.824 --> 00:34:11.225
How were they lit all at once?

00:34:11.304 --> 00:34:12.385
Your Ladyship,

00:34:12.905 --> 00:34:16.145
that Mr. Xiao we took away
asked me to give you this.

00:34:16.225 --> 00:34:17.465
He said it could help you solve the case.

00:34:18.065 --> 00:34:19.905
Why would Her Ladyship
need his help to solve a case?

00:34:19.985 --> 00:34:21.465
Let me take a look.

00:34:21.545 --> 00:34:22.985
See what trick he's playing.

00:35:03.025 --> 00:35:05.385
The palace lanterns were lit
from beneath the stage.

00:35:06.585 --> 00:35:09.825
The killer linked a fuse to each lantern
around the stage,

00:35:09.905 --> 00:35:11.505
gathered them together,

00:35:11.585 --> 00:35:14.865
and lit them at a certain moment
before the kite went up.

00:35:14.945 --> 00:35:16.185
Then the lanterns exploded.

00:35:16.905 --> 00:35:19.185
Their timing was very precise.

00:35:42.305 --> 00:35:43.465
It's all stone paving inside.

00:35:43.545 --> 00:35:46.025
The culprit could only have left
footprints in the soil out here.

00:35:48.465 --> 00:35:50.545
Your Ladyship, I messed up.

00:35:51.145 --> 00:35:53.345
- I'll go look for more.
- Don't bother.

00:35:53.425 --> 00:35:55.345
They've been searching nearby
the whole time.

00:35:55.425 --> 00:35:56.345
The footprints are already a mess.

00:35:56.425 --> 00:35:58.865
Then I'll have someone take
a rubbing of this half footprint.

00:36:05.985 --> 00:36:06.985
I get it now.

00:36:07.705 --> 00:36:10.145
This drawing shows
where the hidden door is.

00:36:10.905 --> 00:36:11.745
Your Ladyship, look.

00:36:13.185 --> 00:36:15.745
That Mr. Xiao is really something.

00:36:18.985 --> 00:36:19.865
Let's go.

00:36:32.425 --> 00:36:33.705
Your Ladyship finally came.

00:36:35.345 --> 00:36:36.465
Come with me.

00:36:37.945 --> 00:36:39.425
So you'll clear my name?

00:36:40.025 --> 00:36:41.945
I never said you did it.

00:36:47.825 --> 00:36:49.745
In that case, I'll take my leave.

00:36:51.945 --> 00:36:53.065
You can leave,

00:36:54.025 --> 00:36:55.265
but you're coming with me to investigate.

00:36:55.985 --> 00:36:58.305
I'm from the Astronomical Bureau.
How could I investigate a case?

00:37:01.185 --> 00:37:04.065
I know where you went
and with whom you met.

00:37:07.145 --> 00:37:08.185
Don't believe me?

00:37:10.225 --> 00:37:13.025
You went to the Hua'e Xianghui Tower.

00:37:15.265 --> 00:37:17.345
An astronomer visiting the palace
on the Lantern Festival.

00:37:17.425 --> 00:37:18.945
It had to be a secret summons.

00:37:19.025 --> 00:37:21.105
That's why you wouldn't say
where you went.

00:37:23.065 --> 00:37:25.905
In the southwest corridor,
you saw the yaksha appear.

00:37:25.985 --> 00:37:28.265
Though you only caught a glimpse,

00:37:28.345 --> 00:37:30.545
your eyes and mind are sharp.

00:37:30.625 --> 00:37:33.905
While sitting in jail,
you worked out the whole mechanism.

00:38:02.065 --> 00:38:04.985
True. I caught a glimpse
and then deduced the rest.

00:38:05.505 --> 00:38:08.145
But as for what else you said,
I have no comment.

00:38:08.225 --> 00:38:09.945
Since Your Ladyship knows I'm innocent,

00:38:11.265 --> 00:38:12.105
allow me to take my leave.

00:38:23.625 --> 00:38:26.305
Heed His Majesty's oral decree.

00:38:28.545 --> 00:38:32.145
With Princess Ningyuan dying unjustly
right before her wedding,

00:38:32.225 --> 00:38:34.625
there may have been someone
stirring trouble in the inner palace.

00:38:34.705 --> 00:38:37.185
Deputy Director
of the Astronomical Bureau,

00:38:37.265 --> 00:38:38.945
Xiao Huaijin,

00:38:39.025 --> 00:38:42.985
peerless in wit and keen in insight,

00:38:43.065 --> 00:38:46.345
is to join the Princess
of Fuchang County, Li Peiyi,

00:38:46.425 --> 00:38:47.825
to solve this case together.

00:38:47.905 --> 00:38:49.265
Accept the decree!

00:38:55.145 --> 00:38:55.985
Mr. Xiao,

00:38:56.065 --> 00:39:00.025
do you object to His Majesty's
wise decision?

00:39:03.905 --> 00:39:07.185
His Majesty has also
granted you a qilin badge.

00:39:07.265 --> 00:39:10.345
You now have free access
to Xingqing Palace.

00:39:11.545 --> 00:39:14.065
I thank His Majesty for this grace.

00:39:18.625 --> 00:39:19.585
Your Ladyship,

00:39:19.665 --> 00:39:22.625
the current priority
is to solve this case at once

00:39:22.705 --> 00:39:25.865
so that the Princess can rest in peace.

00:39:25.945 --> 00:39:26.785
Understood.

00:39:37.705 --> 00:39:39.905
GUEST STAR IN GIRL MANSION

00:39:47.345 --> 00:39:48.505
Was this Your Ladyship's doing too?

00:39:49.145 --> 00:39:51.305
It's His Majesty's decree.
How could I have been involved?

00:39:52.545 --> 00:39:54.105
Then how did Your Ladyship know?

00:39:55.305 --> 00:39:56.585
Know what?

00:39:57.785 --> 00:39:58.505
ON THE NIGHT OF THE LANTERN FESTIVAL
IN THE 13TH YEAR OF DALI

00:39:58.585 --> 00:40:01.865
"A guest star appeared in the Girl mansion
and has lingered for over a month,

00:40:01.945 --> 00:40:03.345
its color blue-black."

00:40:03.945 --> 00:40:04.785
What does it mean?

00:40:05.905 --> 00:40:08.705
An astronomer must not divine or judge.

00:40:09.945 --> 00:40:12.985
The color blue-black
is no auspicious sign.

00:40:14.225 --> 00:40:15.625
It leaves me uneasy.

00:40:20.305 --> 00:40:21.705
Read this.

00:40:25.585 --> 00:40:26.625
{\an8}A STAR HAS APPEARED IN THE GIRL MANSION
IT IS A MOST OMINOUS SIGN

00:40:26.705 --> 00:40:27.745
{\an8}ON THE WUWU DAY OF THE FIRST MONTH
THE STAR HAS APPEARED

00:40:33.385 --> 00:40:34.505
This secret report

00:40:35.105 --> 00:40:38.585
arrived six hours
before the Astronomical Bureau's.

00:40:40.145 --> 00:40:41.825
Where did it come from?

00:40:42.785 --> 00:40:45.465
The Girl mansion, also called Xunv,
governs marriage.

00:40:45.985 --> 00:40:47.065
In the palace now,

00:40:47.145 --> 00:40:49.625
only the wedding
to the Uyghur prince is nearing.

00:40:51.025 --> 00:40:53.705
The Wuwu day of the first month is today.

00:40:54.225 --> 00:40:56.945
I fear someone
will exploit this omen to stir chaos.

00:40:57.025 --> 00:40:59.945
If the marriage alliance fails,
the consequences may be endless.

00:41:01.145 --> 00:41:04.145
Whoever sent this report
has an ulterior motive.

00:41:04.665 --> 00:41:06.585
Find him for me.

00:41:07.105 --> 00:41:08.385
I may not be capable.

00:41:08.465 --> 00:41:11.745
I need someone
with no ties to any faction at court.

00:41:12.385 --> 00:41:13.625
You are my only option.

00:41:13.705 --> 00:41:14.865
I will do my utmost.

00:41:18.185 --> 00:41:21.425
No third person can know of this.

00:41:33.865 --> 00:41:35.825
I've long heard His Majesty
favors Your Ladyship greatly.

00:41:36.345 --> 00:41:37.825
But involving
an astronomer in an investigation

00:41:37.905 --> 00:41:39.105
is no small feat.

00:41:40.025 --> 00:41:41.705
How did you persuade His Majesty?

00:41:43.665 --> 00:41:45.545
Are you refusing the imperial order?

00:41:46.145 --> 00:41:48.665
With no clarity, I can't obey.

00:41:50.905 --> 00:41:52.865
I don't owe you an explanation.

00:41:53.905 --> 00:41:56.225
But since you're just as keen
on knowing the truth as I am,

00:41:56.745 --> 00:41:58.705
I almost feel a kinship with you.

00:41:59.825 --> 00:42:02.025
Astronomical officials
can't enter the palace at will,

00:42:02.105 --> 00:42:03.705
and His Majesty summoned you in secret.

00:42:04.225 --> 00:42:06.385
So there must've been
an ill omen in the heavens,

00:42:06.465 --> 00:42:09.665
probably about turmoil at court
or unrest in the inner palace.

00:42:09.745 --> 00:42:11.625
His Majesty was already uneasy.

00:42:12.145 --> 00:42:13.705
After Wanshun died,

00:42:14.745 --> 00:42:17.465
he certainly feared
it was tied to that omen.

00:42:18.145 --> 00:42:21.185
Having you and me investigate together
would put his mind at ease.

00:42:22.185 --> 00:42:23.425
What if His Majesty
hadn't issued the decree?

00:42:24.905 --> 00:42:27.545
You're always in your bureau.
You don't know my ways.

00:42:28.145 --> 00:42:29.185
Come on.

00:42:29.865 --> 00:42:30.825
I'm used to working alone.

00:42:31.665 --> 00:42:32.745
I don't enjoy company.

00:42:39.545 --> 00:42:40.745
The black powder
that blew the palace lanterns

00:42:40.825 --> 00:42:42.265
was made privately.

00:42:42.345 --> 00:42:43.465
The leads should be outside the palace.

00:42:43.545 --> 00:42:45.545
Then I'll trace the source of the powder.

00:42:46.225 --> 00:42:47.265
Goodbye.

00:42:51.945 --> 00:42:53.585
Are you really letting him
handle the black powder?

00:42:56.385 --> 00:42:59.145
Send someone to follow him
and keep him safe.

00:42:59.665 --> 00:43:00.505
Yes.

00:43:02.585 --> 00:43:04.745
The water buckets
were smeared with tung oil.

00:43:04.825 --> 00:43:07.265
Who was in charge of those buckets?
Who touched them?

00:43:07.345 --> 00:43:09.825
Who saw anyone suspicious? Speak now.

00:43:11.505 --> 00:43:13.705
One of you is suspected
of murdering Princess Ningyuan.

00:43:14.305 --> 00:43:16.185
If anyone conceals what they know,

00:43:16.265 --> 00:43:17.425
they get 50 strokes.

00:43:21.705 --> 00:43:22.985
Do it.

00:43:23.505 --> 00:43:24.585
Wait…

00:43:25.465 --> 00:43:27.505
Hands that have touched tung oil
catch fire easily.

00:43:28.025 --> 00:43:31.025
Since no one will talk,
we'll test you one by one.

00:43:31.105 --> 00:43:32.185
No!

00:43:32.265 --> 00:43:33.105
No!

00:43:33.185 --> 00:43:34.145
I know something!

00:43:34.225 --> 00:43:35.225
I know something.

00:43:35.305 --> 00:43:37.025
I'll talk. I'll talk.

00:43:38.385 --> 00:43:40.985
- Was it you?
- No, not me.

00:43:41.065 --> 00:43:44.305
But… But my roommate,
Liu Deyi, is missing.

00:43:44.385 --> 00:43:46.065
Search every room here.

00:43:46.145 --> 00:43:47.145
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:45:03.345 --> 00:45:04.385
Mother?

00:45:25.105 --> 00:45:26.025
Your Ladyship.

00:45:26.705 --> 00:45:27.745
Your Ladyship?

00:45:29.905 --> 00:45:31.905
Your Ladyship, are you all right?

00:45:34.465 --> 00:45:35.945
I inhaled hallucinogenic incense.

00:45:37.665 --> 00:45:38.985
Your Ladyship.

00:45:47.465 --> 00:45:48.305
It's Liu Deyi!

00:45:52.225 --> 00:45:53.225
He's dead.

00:45:53.825 --> 00:45:55.545
Your Ladyship killed him!

00:45:56.345 --> 00:45:59.105
Are you here to judge cases for the Bureau
and convict Her Ladyship?

00:45:59.185 --> 00:46:00.745
Irrelevant personnel should leave now.

00:46:04.105 --> 00:46:05.945
Your Ladyship, let me.

00:46:08.945 --> 00:46:09.865
The body's still warm.

00:46:11.385 --> 00:46:13.865
He was killed by one fatal strike,
the wound deep and narrow.

00:46:13.945 --> 00:46:14.785
The weapon was likely a dagger.

00:46:14.865 --> 00:46:16.665
The blood's gone dark.

00:46:16.745 --> 00:46:18.065
It's been here about half a ke.

00:46:18.945 --> 00:46:20.265
He was dead before you came in.

00:46:27.185 --> 00:46:28.265
Your Ladyship, look.

00:46:33.305 --> 00:46:36.545
When I came in, the killer had just left.

00:46:36.625 --> 00:46:39.785
Liu Deyi helped them
smear tung oil on the water buckets.

00:46:40.505 --> 00:46:42.705
When he came back,
the killer paid him as promised.

00:46:43.225 --> 00:46:46.105
Then Liu Deyi walked out, off guard,

00:46:46.625 --> 00:46:48.785
and the killer slit
his throat from behind.

00:46:52.425 --> 00:46:53.985
After that, I came
into the storeroom to check.

00:46:54.585 --> 00:46:56.185
The killer climbed out the back window,

00:46:58.745 --> 00:47:00.105
locked the front door,

00:47:01.225 --> 00:47:02.385
and set the incense.

00:47:03.785 --> 00:47:04.865
They were fast.

00:47:05.385 --> 00:47:07.945
Within two hours after the murder,
they silenced their accomplice.

00:47:08.025 --> 00:47:09.665
- I'll go after them.
- Don't.

00:47:10.265 --> 00:47:11.785
They're cautious and efficient.

00:47:11.865 --> 00:47:13.345
They must have planned their route.

00:47:13.945 --> 00:47:15.145
Half a ke is enough to get away.

00:47:19.145 --> 00:47:23.305
A minor eunuch in the inner palace
couldn't have gotten that much tung oil.

00:47:24.145 --> 00:47:25.185
I'll look into it.

00:47:26.745 --> 00:47:27.705
Your Ladyship!

00:47:28.745 --> 00:47:31.105
- Are you all right?
- I'm not dying.

00:47:32.145 --> 00:47:33.425
I'll go get some air.

00:47:33.945 --> 00:47:35.225
Take the body back to the Bureau.

00:47:35.305 --> 00:47:38.145
When you're done,
come find me at Wanshun's residence.

00:47:38.225 --> 00:47:39.505
Understood.

00:48:05.225 --> 00:48:06.105
PRINCE OF DUAN'S MANOR

00:48:07.505 --> 00:48:08.585
Prince of Duan's manor.

00:48:26.705 --> 00:48:28.145
Prince of Duan's manor again.

00:48:29.945 --> 00:48:31.225
I'm walking in circles.

00:48:33.105 --> 00:48:34.145
No.

00:48:34.225 --> 00:48:36.545
Altair, Vega, and Delta Cygni?

00:48:37.145 --> 00:48:40.865
How could these three be positioned
like this in winter?

00:48:45.505 --> 00:48:46.465
It's an illusion.

00:49:24.985 --> 00:49:26.305
Prosecutor of the Court
of Judicial Review, Gu Lingzhou.

00:49:26.385 --> 00:49:27.985
Deputy Director
of the Astronomical Bureau, Xiao Huaijin.

00:49:28.065 --> 00:49:30.065
I saw that man in black
follow you the whole way.

00:49:30.665 --> 00:49:31.865
When I caught up, he was about to leave.

00:49:32.625 --> 00:49:33.465
Did he hurt you?

00:49:33.545 --> 00:49:35.585
He put me under an illusion. But I'm fine.

00:49:35.665 --> 00:49:36.785
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Gu.

00:49:36.865 --> 00:49:39.065
Where are you headed, Mr. Xiao?

00:49:39.145 --> 00:49:40.545
There's no curfew tonight.

00:49:41.065 --> 00:49:43.745
All sorts of demons are waiting
to strike. It's dangerous.

00:49:43.825 --> 00:49:46.625
How could you not know
where I'm going, Mr. Gu?

00:50:15.025 --> 00:50:17.585
XUEJI, PALACE MAID

00:50:19.825 --> 00:50:20.865
Your Ladyship.

00:50:21.905 --> 00:50:25.185
Wanshun's body is barely cold,
yet her rewards have been taken back.

00:50:28.425 --> 00:50:29.865
Why have they even removed
the original furnishings?

00:50:43.345 --> 00:50:46.545
These are not what a princess should use.

00:50:47.065 --> 00:50:47.905
Why didn't you tell me?

00:50:49.465 --> 00:50:52.185
Ever since Your Ladyship
stood up for Her Highness

00:50:52.705 --> 00:50:53.985
and was confined for seven days,

00:50:54.065 --> 00:50:56.425
she's been guilt-ridden.

00:50:56.505 --> 00:50:59.465
She didn't want Your Ladyship
to anger His Majesty again because of her,

00:50:59.985 --> 00:51:03.185
so she forbade me to tell you.

00:51:12.985 --> 00:51:14.425
Why are there so many silk handkerchiefs?

00:51:15.145 --> 00:51:17.225
Her Highness was always frugal,

00:51:18.265 --> 00:51:22.505
but her monthly stipend
was still barely enough.

00:51:23.265 --> 00:51:26.545
So she embroidered handkerchiefs herself

00:51:27.065 --> 00:51:29.825
and had an old nanny who once served her
take them out of the palace to sell.

00:51:30.665 --> 00:51:33.745
The money went
to cover expenses in the palace

00:51:34.345 --> 00:51:36.585
or to trade for better thread and brocade.

00:51:37.425 --> 00:51:39.145
She had it so hard.

00:51:42.465 --> 00:51:46.425
Every year on my birthday,
Wanshun would prepare lavish gifts for me.

00:51:47.625 --> 00:51:49.345
So that's how she saved up
for them, little by little.

00:51:50.145 --> 00:51:53.985
These handkerchiefs
use only plain cloth and thread,

00:51:54.505 --> 00:51:56.265
but the embroidery is highly exquisite.

00:51:57.105 --> 00:52:00.665
Please take one, Your Ladyship,
as a keepsake.

00:52:08.665 --> 00:52:10.825
It was said
that Wanshun's mother, Lady Shiyanna,

00:52:10.905 --> 00:52:13.185
could attract dozens of birds
with a single dance.

00:52:14.065 --> 00:52:15.585
I only knew Wanshun danced well.

00:52:16.385 --> 00:52:20.145
I never knew she could embroider so well.

00:52:21.185 --> 00:52:23.505
Her Highness's mother was low-born

00:52:24.145 --> 00:52:25.585
and died young.

00:52:27.025 --> 00:52:30.345
Other than Your Ladyship,
she had no close friends.

00:52:31.145 --> 00:52:33.625
Given you were always busy with duty,

00:52:34.945 --> 00:52:36.905
she didn't want to trouble you.

00:52:37.625 --> 00:52:39.665
So she embroidered handkerchiefs

00:52:40.465 --> 00:52:44.185
to help with expenses and pass the time.

00:52:59.185 --> 00:53:02.145
Your Ladyship,
I just remembered something.

00:53:02.225 --> 00:53:04.145
Two years ago,
at His Majesty's birthday banquet,

00:53:04.225 --> 00:53:05.585
Her Highness presented a gift.

00:53:05.665 --> 00:53:06.705
Do you remember?

00:53:11.825 --> 00:53:13.825
My beloved, what do you think?

00:53:14.425 --> 00:53:16.545
This double-sided embroidered piece
depicting a dragon soaring across seas

00:53:16.625 --> 00:53:18.185
is truly exquisite.

00:53:18.265 --> 00:53:21.385
A work like this
must have required years of skill.

00:53:21.465 --> 00:53:25.985
And you can see
the gift-giver's sincerity.

00:53:27.465 --> 00:53:29.425
Lovely. Reward them.

00:53:32.345 --> 00:53:33.865
It says "Wanshun" here.

00:53:37.025 --> 00:53:39.385
Summon the Fifteenth Princess!

00:53:54.305 --> 00:53:56.865
Father. Your Highness.

00:54:03.065 --> 00:54:05.185
Cui Manshu and Wanshun both prepared

00:54:05.265 --> 00:54:07.705
a double-sided embroidered piece
depicting a dragon crossing seas?

00:54:07.785 --> 00:54:09.585
Ninth Lady Cui
planned it half a year ahead

00:54:09.665 --> 00:54:12.185
and spent a fortune
to commission that gold-thread piece.

00:54:12.265 --> 00:54:15.025
She never expected it
to coincide with Her Highness's gift.

00:54:15.705 --> 00:54:18.305
Lady Cui is proud and domineering.
She wouldn't let it slide.

00:54:18.385 --> 00:54:21.505
Two months after the banquet,
it was Lady Cui's birthday.

00:54:21.585 --> 00:54:25.905
Her Highness scraped money together
to buy a beautiful gold hairpin

00:54:25.985 --> 00:54:28.025
and delivered it to her in person.

00:54:28.545 --> 00:54:31.305
Lady Cui expressed her gratitude,

00:54:31.385 --> 00:54:34.265
but then handed it to a servant
right in front of her.

00:54:34.785 --> 00:54:36.345
Her Highness didn't mind, though.

00:54:36.425 --> 00:54:38.225
After all, they were never close.

00:54:38.825 --> 00:54:40.785
After that, they rarely spoke.

00:54:40.865 --> 00:54:43.785
If anyone had a grudge with Her Highness,

00:54:43.865 --> 00:54:45.785
Ninth Lady Cui might count.

00:54:46.465 --> 00:54:48.145
But to be fair,

00:54:48.665 --> 00:54:50.425
she was the one who slighted Her Highness.

00:54:52.705 --> 00:54:54.265
Are the women
of the Right Chancellor's household

00:54:54.345 --> 00:54:55.505
still in the palace?

00:54:56.225 --> 00:54:58.345
We've finished questioning the guests.
Nothing stood out.

00:54:58.425 --> 00:55:00.745
Now they're all leaving
the palace and returning home.

00:55:09.905 --> 00:55:10.945
What did you find?

00:55:12.385 --> 00:55:13.465
The tung oil came from
the Palace Workshop Service.

00:55:13.545 --> 00:55:14.505
They use it to make oilcloth garments.

00:55:15.145 --> 00:55:16.185
If I hadn't asked,

00:55:16.265 --> 00:55:17.585
they wouldn't even have noticed
a bucket was missing.

00:55:18.425 --> 00:55:21.065
So they don't know how or when
it went missing.

00:55:22.025 --> 00:55:23.105
But there's some good news.

00:55:23.705 --> 00:55:25.825
That half footprint matches the tread

00:55:25.905 --> 00:55:28.585
on waterproof oiled boots
worn by boatmen and water carriers.

00:55:29.745 --> 00:55:30.585
Oiled boots?

00:55:31.385 --> 00:55:33.345
Did anyone leave the palace
without being checked?

00:55:34.305 --> 00:55:35.865
The Uyghur prince.

00:55:35.945 --> 00:55:38.025
After the incident,
the Imperial Guards escorted him out.

00:55:38.105 --> 00:55:39.705
His Majesty authorized it.

00:55:44.985 --> 00:55:46.425
Your Ladyship? This is uncanny.

00:55:47.905 --> 00:55:50.505
I thank Your Ladyship
for sending Mr. Gu to protect me.

00:55:50.585 --> 00:55:51.945
After I left the palace,

00:55:52.025 --> 00:55:53.545
I searched for black powder
shops on the west side of the city.

00:55:53.625 --> 00:55:54.865
What did you find?

00:55:55.465 --> 00:55:57.585
With just a few words from a shop owner,

00:55:58.185 --> 00:56:00.425
Mr. Xiao deduced
the killer was about six chi tall.

00:56:00.505 --> 00:56:04.545
On the sixth, someone did come
to buy black powder.

00:56:04.625 --> 00:56:05.945
Do you remember what he looked like?

00:56:07.105 --> 00:56:08.305
I didn't see his face at all.

00:56:08.385 --> 00:56:12.545
He stood outside under the eaves,
where the light couldn't reach.

00:56:12.625 --> 00:56:15.305
He was by that basket.

00:56:15.385 --> 00:56:16.865
The top of his shadow

00:56:17.385 --> 00:56:19.745
was right about here.

00:56:19.825 --> 00:56:22.625
He wore a big cloak
with its large hood pulled up.

00:56:22.705 --> 00:56:25.665
From a mere shadow,
I couldn't make much out.

00:56:25.745 --> 00:56:27.705
- Were the lamps lit that night?
- No.

00:56:27.785 --> 00:56:28.985
When did he come?

00:56:29.065 --> 00:56:30.985
Near the end of the Xu hour.

00:56:32.105 --> 00:56:34.505
FENG’S GROCERY

00:56:46.225 --> 00:56:47.705
ARRANGE TO FORM A SQUARE
THE LEG FOUR UNITS LONG

00:56:52.385 --> 00:56:53.665
THREE KE INTO THE CHOU HOUR
THE TOTAL AREA OF THE TWO TRIANGLES

00:56:53.745 --> 00:56:56.385
{\an8}SHADOW LENGTH: FOUR CHI

00:56:59.905 --> 00:57:03.225
SHADOW LENGTH: FOUR CHI
MAN'S HEIGHT: SIX CHI

00:57:03.305 --> 00:57:04.465
The man is six chi tall,

00:57:05.065 --> 00:57:06.065
about the same as Mr. Gu.

00:57:06.145 --> 00:57:07.625
How do you know?

00:57:08.385 --> 00:57:09.465
The moon told me.

00:57:10.065 --> 00:57:11.145
The moon?

00:57:15.305 --> 00:57:17.945
Six chi tall, skilled in martial arts,

00:57:18.025 --> 00:57:19.705
and able to enter
and leave the palace freely.

00:57:20.225 --> 00:57:21.585
Four crates of black powder aren't cheap.

00:57:21.665 --> 00:57:24.265
With that kind of money,
his status must be high.

00:57:24.865 --> 00:57:26.985
That still leaves too many people.

00:57:27.505 --> 00:57:29.625
Military officials, invited guests,

00:57:29.705 --> 00:57:31.545
Inner Guards, Imperial Guards…

00:57:33.305 --> 00:57:35.945
He must have a place to stay
in Yanshou Ward.

00:57:38.705 --> 00:57:39.905
Right.

00:57:39.985 --> 00:57:41.505
When he bought the black powder,
curfew was already in effect.

00:57:42.145 --> 00:57:44.705
Pushing a cart, he couldn't
have left Yanshou Ward.

00:57:46.985 --> 00:57:48.985
But why did you come here, Your Ladyship?

00:57:50.145 --> 00:57:52.385
We found oiled boot prints near the stage.

00:57:52.465 --> 00:57:53.745
He likely took the waterways.

00:57:53.825 --> 00:57:55.905
Yanshou Ward

00:57:55.985 --> 00:57:58.105
has the Qingming Canal,
Yong'an Canal, and Cao Canal

00:57:58.185 --> 00:57:59.385
on the east, west,
and south, respectively.

00:58:00.025 --> 00:58:02.345
After leaving the palace,
he likely hid here.

00:58:02.425 --> 00:58:04.105
Our leads point the same way.

00:58:04.705 --> 00:58:06.505
The man in black
who put me under an illusion

00:58:06.585 --> 00:58:07.945
was also about six chi tall.

00:58:08.025 --> 00:58:10.465
How could you tell his height, Mr. Xiao?

00:58:10.545 --> 00:58:11.945
You may not have noticed,

00:58:12.025 --> 00:58:15.065
but his forearm length
matched the width of a false window

00:58:15.145 --> 00:58:16.665
on the alley wall.

00:58:17.585 --> 00:58:18.865
In the Western Capital,

00:58:18.945 --> 00:58:21.665
the false windows of commoners' homes
are one chi and five fen wide.

00:58:21.745 --> 00:58:23.785
That means his arm
is about three chi long,

00:58:23.865 --> 00:58:25.385
and his height should
indeed be around six chi.

00:58:29.865 --> 00:58:32.585
Your Ladyship. Mr. Xiao. Mr. Gu.

00:58:34.705 --> 00:58:36.705
General Lin,
didn't you escort Prince Wutele

00:58:36.785 --> 00:58:37.865
back to the Court of State Ceremonial?

00:58:37.945 --> 00:58:39.785
I've escorted him there safely.

00:58:39.865 --> 00:58:40.945
I was supposed to return
to report for duty,

00:58:41.025 --> 00:58:42.665
but I received a last-minute order

00:58:42.745 --> 00:58:44.985
to assist Your Ladyship
in searching for the killer here.

00:58:46.145 --> 00:58:49.025
The killer likely
has a hideout in Yanshou Ward.

00:58:50.745 --> 00:58:53.265
It shouldn't be far from the canals

00:58:53.785 --> 00:58:55.545
and should be
a relatively secluded residence,

00:58:56.225 --> 00:58:58.065
so it won't draw the neighbors' suspicion.

00:58:59.705 --> 00:59:03.145
He's six chi tall,
skilled, and extremely cautious.

00:59:03.665 --> 00:59:05.825
- Everyone, stay sharp.
- Understood.

00:59:07.225 --> 00:59:08.465
Mr. Xiao, why don't you say a few words?

00:59:11.865 --> 00:59:13.345
If it's a planned hideout,

00:59:13.425 --> 00:59:15.585
it was likely rented, not his real home.

00:59:17.185 --> 00:59:19.665
Let's each take an alley
and search separately.

00:59:21.425 --> 00:59:22.425
Wuren and I will take this one.

00:59:23.025 --> 00:59:23.945
We'll meet up with you later.

00:59:25.025 --> 00:59:26.145
All right.

00:59:27.545 --> 00:59:30.985
Mr. Xiao, you're not built
for chasing a suspect.

00:59:31.065 --> 00:59:31.905

If you find anything, alert everyone.

00:59:43.225 --> 00:59:44.505
Don't act rashly.

00:59:44.585 --> 00:59:45.625
