WEBVTT

00:00:06.694 --> 00:00:07.612
Come on, Taiga!

00:00:07.695 --> 00:00:09.531
Don't fall behind!

00:00:11.616 --> 00:00:13.660
Keep up or you'll lose!

00:00:17.956 --> 00:00:20.458
Even if our ace runner buys us time,
there's no point

00:00:20.959 --> 00:00:23.044
if everyone else wastes it.

00:00:24.838 --> 00:00:25.755
Taiga.

00:00:27.882 --> 00:00:29.300
You're off the team.

00:00:33.263 --> 00:00:36.307
- Man, that's brutal.
- Poor guy.

00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:37.851
He didn't make it after all.

00:02:01.851 --> 00:02:03.895
‪TANOMI

00:02:03.978 --> 00:02:06.231
So you're going
to tour properties together?

00:02:07.857 --> 00:02:10.985
Yeah. We're going on our next day off.

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:14.614
You don't waste any time, huh?

00:02:14.697 --> 00:02:16.324
It's not what you're thinking.

00:02:16.407 --> 00:02:19.827
I'm only going for moral support.

00:02:19.911 --> 00:02:21.829
Are you stupid?

00:02:21.913 --> 00:02:24.999
You think she'd tour properties with a guy
who's not her parent or boyfriend?

00:02:30.046 --> 00:02:30.964
You think so?

00:02:31.047 --> 00:02:32.632
- Shige.
- Huh?

00:02:32.715 --> 00:02:34.634
Taiga is about to get a girlfriend.

00:02:34.717 --> 00:02:37.512
- Noa! It's not like that!
- I didn't expect that.

00:02:37.595 --> 00:02:39.013
Like I said, it's not like that.

00:02:40.348 --> 00:02:42.809
And plus, even if it was,

00:02:42.892 --> 00:02:44.686
our relationship wouldn't go anywhere.

00:02:45.436 --> 00:02:46.437
Why?

00:02:47.772 --> 00:02:49.899
She's an international student from Korea,

00:02:50.483 --> 00:02:52.568
so she shouldn't be with someone like me.

00:02:53.111 --> 00:02:54.570
Someone like you?

00:02:54.654 --> 00:02:56.030
I mean…

00:02:56.614 --> 00:02:58.950
Someone with no future.

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:02.954
So you're saying

00:03:03.037 --> 00:03:06.040
that a restaurant employee
is going to accompany you?

00:03:08.876 --> 00:03:12.255
Yes, um…

00:03:12.922 --> 00:03:14.924
Kind of like a Japanese advisor.

00:03:17.135 --> 00:03:19.804
Taiga isn't suspicious at all.

00:03:19.887 --> 00:03:22.515
He came with me
out of the kindness of his heart.

00:03:22.598 --> 00:03:23.433
‪KAEDE REAL ESTATE

00:03:23.516 --> 00:03:24.642
All right.

00:03:24.726 --> 00:03:28.855
Well then, let me suggest some
properties that might fit your taste.

00:03:28.938 --> 00:03:30.356
Thank you.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.902
I picked out a few
that fit your requirements.

00:03:34.986 --> 00:03:35.945
In your case,

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:40.742
the trickiest part
is that you have to move out in one year.

00:03:41.576 --> 00:03:44.620
Well, why don't we take
a tour of them first?

00:03:50.543 --> 00:03:51.419
Well…

00:03:52.754 --> 00:03:54.881
You're leaving in a year, huh?

00:03:55.381 --> 00:03:56.466
Yes.

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.926
If I can actually graduate, that is.

00:04:00.553 --> 00:04:02.722
My student visa is going to expire,

00:04:02.805 --> 00:04:06.851
so I can't stay in Japan
unless I start working.

00:04:07.352 --> 00:04:08.519
Oh, your visa?

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.314
Wow, that's amazing.

00:04:12.815 --> 00:04:13.900
Amazing?

00:04:14.484 --> 00:04:16.194
What about it is amazing?

00:04:18.363 --> 00:04:21.366
Well, just talking about visas and stuff

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:23.576
is amazing from my point of view.

00:04:24.869 --> 00:04:27.246
It's like you're talking about
a whole different world.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.791
There's nothing amazing about it.

00:04:30.416 --> 00:04:33.169
International students
all stay here with student visas,

00:04:33.252 --> 00:04:35.463
and go back to Korea once they graduate.

00:04:35.963 --> 00:04:37.465
I see…

00:04:38.091 --> 00:04:39.550
Of course…

00:04:39.634 --> 00:04:41.177
Before that,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.180
I hope I can cross things
off my bucket list.

00:04:45.598 --> 00:04:46.974
Bucket list?

00:04:48.643 --> 00:04:49.477
Yes.

00:04:50.186 --> 00:04:54.732
A list of things that I want to do
before I die.

00:04:54.816 --> 00:04:57.777
One item on my bucket list

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.863
is to try every kind
of Japanese convenience store snack.

00:05:01.989 --> 00:05:02.990
I see.

00:05:03.741 --> 00:05:05.034
Interesting.

00:05:05.118 --> 00:05:08.246
Why don't you make one too?

00:05:08.329 --> 00:05:09.330
What?

00:05:10.456 --> 00:05:12.458
I don't think that's necessary.

00:05:12.542 --> 00:05:14.210
You agree, right Noa?

00:05:14.293 --> 00:05:16.629
But your daughter
is in middle school, right?

00:05:17.964 --> 00:05:19.924
Then I guess she'd want a new device.

00:05:20.007 --> 00:05:22.468
As long as I can make a call,
that's enough for me.

00:05:22.552 --> 00:05:24.512
They're all the same, no?

00:05:24.595 --> 00:05:26.764
They are not all the same.

00:05:26.848 --> 00:05:28.683
The image quality and stuff are different.

00:05:28.766 --> 00:05:30.101
You think so?

00:05:31.436 --> 00:05:35.106
So your labor right now is going to turn
into your daughter's smartphone?

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:37.817
That's right. It's ridiculous.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.612
I wish she'd just keep using
the one she's used to.

00:05:55.543 --> 00:05:58.629
I don't know… It's pretty nice but…

00:05:58.713 --> 00:06:00.089
What do you think?

00:06:05.887 --> 00:06:07.555
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

00:06:07.638 --> 00:06:11.976
Does a lot of smoke rise up
from the restaurants below?

00:06:14.145 --> 00:06:16.898
I don't think it'll be a problem,

00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:19.066
but I can ask about it.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.193
Okay, thank you.

00:06:22.945 --> 00:06:25.198
The placement of the exhaust fans
might be an issue.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.784
I didn't notice that at all.

00:06:37.084 --> 00:06:37.919
Oh, Taiga.

00:06:39.462 --> 00:06:41.964
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes.

00:06:42.048 --> 00:06:45.760
This room doesn't have a refrigerator
or washing machine or anything.

00:06:47.094 --> 00:06:49.931
Rooms in Korea usually come
with appliances.

00:06:50.014 --> 00:06:51.390
Oh really?

00:06:52.808 --> 00:06:54.644
Well, it's not like
anything is wrong here.

00:06:54.727 --> 00:06:57.438
In Japan, this is normal.

00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:59.232
Oh, good.

00:06:59.315 --> 00:07:02.777
If you have any questions,
don't hesitate to ask me.

00:07:03.945 --> 00:07:05.446
Thank you.

00:07:10.618 --> 00:07:12.036
These windows are cute!

00:07:15.081 --> 00:07:16.749
The kitchen is big too.

00:07:19.168 --> 00:07:20.503
I like this place.

00:07:22.922 --> 00:07:24.882
This is a really nice place.

00:07:25.424 --> 00:07:29.220
I agree. The rent is not too high either.

00:07:29.303 --> 00:07:31.138
I like it a lot.

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:33.849
I think my mind is set on this one.

00:07:34.976 --> 00:07:36.519
Wait a second.

00:07:50.283 --> 00:07:51.826
No issues with the security either.

00:07:59.125 --> 00:08:01.127
Thank you for today.

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:03.671
I found a nice place thanks to you.

00:08:03.754 --> 00:08:05.548
I didn't do anything.

00:08:06.215 --> 00:08:08.009
I'm glad you found a place.

00:08:09.594 --> 00:08:13.222
I hope they accept my application.

00:08:15.391 --> 00:08:18.060
It'll be fine. I'm sure.

00:08:25.067 --> 00:08:26.277
Taiga.

00:08:28.029 --> 00:08:29.780
Today, I…

00:08:31.532 --> 00:08:33.117
had a lot of fun.

00:08:36.537 --> 00:08:39.206
Looking at houses is fun, isn't it?

00:08:44.045 --> 00:08:45.338
Um…

00:08:47.006 --> 00:08:51.719
{\an8}STRAWBERRY CARAMEL

00:08:57.516 --> 00:09:00.561
This is a thank you gift for today.

00:09:00.645 --> 00:09:01.729
Here you go.

00:09:09.445 --> 00:09:10.988
Thank you.

00:09:16.952 --> 00:09:18.204
Well, see you…

00:09:19.705 --> 00:09:20.748
Right…

00:09:22.833 --> 00:09:25.711
Well then… See you.

00:09:57.952 --> 00:10:00.788
You should give up on Onigiri Man.

00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:03.040
We had a good vibe,

00:10:03.124 --> 00:10:04.875
so why didn't he ask me out
on another date?

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:07.753
Did I do something wrong?

00:10:08.421 --> 00:10:09.672
That's not it.

00:10:09.755 --> 00:10:11.966
Didn't I tell you before?

00:10:12.967 --> 00:10:14.844
Japanese men are extremely reserved

00:10:14.927 --> 00:10:18.472
when it comes to expressing
their feelings.

00:10:18.556 --> 00:10:20.683
Isn't that just your opinion?

00:10:21.183 --> 00:10:22.768
Park Rin!

00:10:22.852 --> 00:10:25.229
How many times do I have to tell you?

00:10:25.855 --> 00:10:28.858
I am a professional content buyer, okay?

00:10:28.941 --> 00:10:33.738
I've watched
all the movies and dramas to death.

00:10:33.821 --> 00:10:35.406
But dramas are just dramas.

00:10:35.489 --> 00:10:36.323
What are you saying!

00:10:36.407 --> 00:10:41.704
Dramas reflect
the culture of that country.

00:10:41.787 --> 00:10:43.622
According to my database,

00:10:43.706 --> 00:10:47.752
main characters in Japanese dramas
are more sensitive.

00:10:47.835 --> 00:10:52.798
In many stories, they overthink everything
and don't even get together in the end.

00:10:54.175 --> 00:10:55.134
Really?

00:10:56.135 --> 00:10:57.303
Yes.

00:10:59.096 --> 00:11:03.559
Dating someone of a different nationality
isn't easy.

00:11:03.642 --> 00:11:05.519
So don't try to rush into it
unnecessarily.

00:11:08.439 --> 00:11:09.607
Yeah?

00:11:10.191 --> 00:11:11.734
Park Rin.

00:11:11.817 --> 00:11:13.486
If you keep acting like that,

00:11:13.569 --> 00:11:16.030
- I will tell your mother.
- Don't you dare!

00:11:17.406 --> 00:11:20.117
Fine. I'll stop.

00:11:21.535 --> 00:11:24.580
I'm here to study, after all.

00:11:24.663 --> 00:11:26.123
That's right.

00:11:27.917 --> 00:11:29.710
I have to go. Bye!

00:11:30.419 --> 00:11:31.837
Enjoy the party.

00:11:34.215 --> 00:11:36.759
- How has your mother been lately?
- Who knows?

00:11:37.718 --> 00:11:40.346
I'm sure she's having fun with a guy,
as usual.

00:11:40.429 --> 00:11:42.389
It's okay, I'll do it myself.

00:11:43.599 --> 00:11:45.518
She'll show up when she feels like it.

00:11:47.019 --> 00:11:48.270
You're okay with that?

00:11:50.397 --> 00:11:52.900
I don't have any other choice, do I?

00:11:54.026 --> 00:11:55.236
More importantly,

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.905
are you serious about what you said?

00:11:58.781 --> 00:12:02.159
Well, ever since I started,
I've been preparing myself

00:12:03.786 --> 00:12:06.413
for the possibility of closing
the restaurant when I retire.

00:12:09.583 --> 00:12:12.545
Hey, if you're going to retire,

00:12:13.462 --> 00:12:14.922
why not have Taiga take over?

00:12:15.881 --> 00:12:18.300
That would be a lot to ask of him.

00:12:18.884 --> 00:12:19.718
You think so?

00:12:27.226 --> 00:12:29.645
I didn't pass the contest again.

00:12:30.354 --> 00:12:31.522
What about you?

00:12:31.605 --> 00:12:33.440
I didn't make it either.

00:12:39.446 --> 00:12:40.281
I heard Amane

00:12:40.864 --> 00:12:43.284
is going to have her solo exhibition
in New York.

00:12:43.784 --> 00:12:44.868
She's making figurines too.

00:12:46.829 --> 00:12:47.871
Wow.

00:12:47.955 --> 00:12:50.332
When you have that much talent,

00:12:50.416 --> 00:12:52.084
I bet you don't
have to worry about your future.

00:12:52.167 --> 00:12:55.379
After graduating, she can just go
straight into the professional world.

00:12:57.131 --> 00:12:59.466
I have to decide on what to do myself.

00:13:00.134 --> 00:13:04.138
Rin, you're going back to Korea
and not finding a job over here, right?

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:08.642
For the most part, that's my plan…

00:13:09.184 --> 00:13:10.811
I'm so jealous.

00:13:10.894 --> 00:13:13.814
Maybe I'll follow you and go to Korea too?

00:13:13.897 --> 00:13:15.024
Just kidding.

00:13:33.459 --> 00:13:34.501
Thank you for the food.

00:13:43.927 --> 00:13:44.803
That's delicious.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.224
What is this dish called?

00:13:49.808 --> 00:13:52.811
Today, it's Pacific Barrelfish
cooked in a bamboo steamer.

00:13:53.646 --> 00:13:55.856
It's a white fish,
but it's nice and fatty, right?

00:13:55.939 --> 00:13:59.526
When it's freshly caught,
the skin is greasy.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:00.903
Greasy?

00:14:01.987 --> 00:14:05.240
Is that different from "slimy"?

00:14:05.949 --> 00:14:07.910
Well, it's basically in the same family.

00:14:07.993 --> 00:14:11.038
You're so knowledgeable.
You're amazing, Master.

00:14:11.121 --> 00:14:14.333
A cook should be knowledgeable
about his ingredients.

00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:18.504
Even when I go to an aquarium,
I know almost all the fish there.

00:14:18.587 --> 00:14:20.047
Really? Wow.

00:14:21.966 --> 00:14:25.219
That reminds me…
I haven't been to an aquarium in ages.

00:14:25.302 --> 00:14:26.470
Oh really?

00:14:27.721 --> 00:14:29.306
You should have someone take you.

00:14:33.852 --> 00:14:35.187
Hey.

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.231
If you want to, just ask her.

00:14:38.065 --> 00:14:39.525
What are you talking about?

00:14:39.608 --> 00:14:42.403
You've been staring at her the whole time.

00:14:43.028 --> 00:14:46.323
- I was not staring.
- You were staring at her like a creep.

00:14:46.865 --> 00:14:48.492
You were eavesdropping too, right?

00:14:49.535 --> 00:14:51.495
Hurry up and take this chance.

00:14:53.664 --> 00:14:57.501
But she said she's going back
to Korea in a year.

00:14:57.584 --> 00:15:00.004
Even if I ask her to go with me,
it'll only trouble her.

00:15:00.087 --> 00:15:01.797
Yeah, yeah… Just go!

00:15:08.053 --> 00:15:09.096
Um…

00:15:10.014 --> 00:15:10.973
Yes?

00:15:11.724 --> 00:15:16.186
I overheard
that you haven't been to an aquarium.

00:15:16.812 --> 00:15:17.896
Yes.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.149
I haven't been to one since I was a child.

00:15:23.402 --> 00:15:24.611
If you…

00:15:26.447 --> 00:15:29.700
happen to have a day
where you have absolutely nothing to do,

00:15:30.409 --> 00:15:33.370
- would you like to go to an aquarium--
- Yes.

00:15:34.788 --> 00:15:36.665
Huh? Really?

00:15:37.624 --> 00:15:38.917
I'd love to go.

00:15:39.543 --> 00:15:40.711
Let's go together.

00:15:51.346 --> 00:15:53.724
AKINORI: I'M OUT OF MONEY!
COME TO THE PACHINKO PARLOR!

00:15:57.227 --> 00:15:58.312
Yes.

00:16:10.491 --> 00:16:11.533
How is it going?

00:16:11.617 --> 00:16:13.702
I'm definitely going to win big.

00:16:13.786 --> 00:16:14.995
I know it.

00:16:15.496 --> 00:16:16.663
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:16:17.247 --> 00:16:19.166
No doubt about it.

00:16:21.835 --> 00:16:22.669
Please?

00:16:26.757 --> 00:16:28.217
Fine…

00:16:29.802 --> 00:16:31.011
‪10000 YEN

00:16:32.346 --> 00:16:34.348
- Here.
- Thank you, Noa.

00:16:34.848 --> 00:16:36.767
Let's go eat yakiniku or sushi today.

00:16:37.851 --> 00:16:40.187
- All right. I'll look forward to it.
- Okay.

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:41.730
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

00:16:48.487 --> 00:16:49.738
All right!

00:17:01.166 --> 00:17:04.586
{\an8}HOW ABOUT THIS AQUARIUM?

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:09.550
{\an8}DOES THE 24TH OR 25TH WORK FOR YOU?

00:17:10.134 --> 00:17:12.553
AQUA WORLD

00:17:16.682 --> 00:17:18.767
{\an8}It's pretty big.

00:17:18.851 --> 00:17:21.436
{\an8}The sea lion show is once every two hours.

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.021
So start with penguins…

00:17:24.857 --> 00:17:26.692
And after that…

00:17:41.832 --> 00:17:43.500
{\an8}BIG BRO - I WAS PROMOTED TO SECTION CHIEF

00:17:43.584 --> 00:17:45.043
{\an8}MOM - YOUR HARD WORK PAID OFF

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:50.132
Taiga. You're off the team.

00:17:50.215 --> 00:17:52.050
He got an endorsement and he's a reserve?

00:17:52.134 --> 00:17:53.969
Are you going to Tokyo to run away?

00:17:54.052 --> 00:17:55.179
Are you really sure?

00:17:55.262 --> 00:17:56.805
He didn't make it after all.

00:18:11.403 --> 00:18:13.655
{\an8}TICKET

00:18:14.364 --> 00:18:16.074
All right.

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:28.128
ITINERARY

00:18:28.212 --> 00:18:29.504
PENGUIN POOL - SEA LION SHOW

00:18:36.303 --> 00:18:39.014
I'm sorry. Did I make you wait?

00:18:39.097 --> 00:18:40.849
Oh, no. Not at all.

00:18:41.892 --> 00:18:43.185
Ready to go?

00:18:43.936 --> 00:18:44.895
Yes.

00:18:57.699 --> 00:18:58.909
Pretty…

00:18:59.868 --> 00:19:01.870
Did you want to see any specific fish?

00:19:03.997 --> 00:19:06.833
I want to see that thing…

00:19:07.376 --> 00:19:08.502
Gaoli.

00:19:08.585 --> 00:19:09.628
Kaoli?

00:19:10.629 --> 00:19:12.589
Um…

00:19:13.507 --> 00:19:16.385
Oh, right. A ray.

00:19:18.303 --> 00:19:19.554
A ray?

00:19:19.638 --> 00:19:21.556
I want to see the underside of a ray.

00:19:22.474 --> 00:19:24.059
Is that called their underside?

00:19:24.601 --> 00:19:25.852
It's not?

00:19:25.936 --> 00:19:28.814
It looks like a face
and it's kind of cute.

00:19:28.897 --> 00:19:30.315
They're always smiling.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.069
Let's make sure we see the rays then.

00:19:34.152 --> 00:19:35.904
I'll guide you through the facility,

00:19:35.988 --> 00:19:37.572
so you just enjoy yourself.

00:19:37.656 --> 00:19:39.241
Thank you.

00:19:41.952 --> 00:19:42.953
But…

00:19:47.624 --> 00:19:49.710
I want to enjoy it with you.

00:19:52.546 --> 00:19:53.505
Yes.

00:19:53.588 --> 00:19:55.507
Of course, me too.

00:19:57.175 --> 00:19:59.052
Wow! Penguins?

00:19:59.136 --> 00:20:02.556
Yes. It's a popular attraction,
and a lot of them swim in the pool.

00:20:02.639 --> 00:20:05.183
I saw it on their homepage,
and they were really cute.

00:20:05.267 --> 00:20:06.518
- Really?
- Yes.

00:20:06.601 --> 00:20:08.145
I can't wait to see.

00:20:08.937 --> 00:20:10.105
{\an8}This is the penguin area.

00:20:10.188 --> 00:20:11.315
{\an8}‪HUMBOLDT PENGUIN

00:20:17.738 --> 00:20:20.866
Where are the penguins?

00:20:28.623 --> 00:20:30.000
{\an8}They're not here, huh?

00:20:30.584 --> 00:20:31.626
{\an8}Are they on break?

00:20:38.383 --> 00:20:40.469
There's a sea lion show. Want to see that?

00:20:40.552 --> 00:20:42.471
Sea lions are really smart and cute.

00:20:42.554 --> 00:20:44.931
Yeah. I'm excited.

00:20:45.807 --> 00:20:47.351
- It's this way.
- Okay.

00:20:49.895 --> 00:20:52.731
How do you say sea lion in Korean?

00:20:53.482 --> 00:20:54.691
Mulgae.

00:20:54.775 --> 00:20:55.901
Mulgae?

00:20:55.984 --> 00:20:57.736
- We will make an announcement soon.
- Mulgae.

00:20:58.779 --> 00:21:00.072
We're very sorry.

00:21:01.114 --> 00:21:03.283
We apologize.

00:21:03.367 --> 00:21:04.451
Excuse me.

00:21:04.534 --> 00:21:07.079
We're sorry, but there were some
issues with the tank.

00:21:07.162 --> 00:21:08.872
So we're trying to repair it now.

00:21:08.955 --> 00:21:10.749
What? Oh no…

00:21:10.832 --> 00:21:12.000
We're terribly sorry.

00:21:12.084 --> 00:21:13.668
What should we do?

00:21:15.796 --> 00:21:19.174
This aquarium is famous
for their special drink. Want to try it?

00:21:19.257 --> 00:21:22.219
- Sounds good.
- It's this way.

00:21:24.262 --> 00:21:25.263
{\an8}PENGUIN SODA

00:21:25.347 --> 00:21:26.807
{\an8}How cute!

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:30.894
I'm sorry. We just ran out
of the Penguin Soda.

00:21:30.977 --> 00:21:34.481
You've got to be kidding.
We came here expecting to buy this.

00:21:34.564 --> 00:21:36.066
You think it's some joke?

00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:38.318
You didn't even do the sea lion show.

00:21:39.236 --> 00:21:41.947
I can't believe we had to pay
the same entrance fee.

00:21:42.572 --> 00:21:43.949
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

00:21:44.825 --> 00:21:46.368
I'm very sorry.

00:21:47.119 --> 00:21:49.079
Hello, can you take our order?

00:21:49.579 --> 00:21:52.374
I'm sorry,
we're out of our special Penguin Soda.

00:21:52.457 --> 00:21:55.293
No worries. Must be tough, huh?

00:22:11.226 --> 00:22:12.436
I'm sorry.

00:22:13.019 --> 00:22:15.313
It's not going as planned at all.

00:22:15.814 --> 00:22:16.648
No…

00:22:17.315 --> 00:22:20.902
I appreciate how much thought
you put into it.

00:22:26.199 --> 00:22:27.409
The sea lion show…

00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:29.578
I hope it reopens soon.

00:22:33.331 --> 00:22:35.959
BIG BRO

00:22:41.339 --> 00:22:43.508
- Give me a second.
- Take your time.

00:22:48.513 --> 00:22:51.266
Sorry, I was kind of busy.

00:22:52.225 --> 00:22:53.518
What's wrong?

00:22:54.394 --> 00:22:58.064
Mom fell at home and hurt herself.

00:22:58.732 --> 00:22:59.900
What?

00:22:59.983 --> 00:23:01.193
Is she all right?

00:23:01.276 --> 00:23:04.112
Yeah, they're taking
a look at her at the hospital.

00:23:04.196 --> 00:23:05.739
It wasn't anything serious.

00:23:06.865 --> 00:23:08.575
Thank goodness.

00:23:09.951 --> 00:23:11.620
You know,

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:14.456
why aren't you looking after the family?

00:23:14.539 --> 00:23:16.082
Why do I have to take time off work?

00:23:18.084 --> 00:23:19.169
Sorry…

00:23:21.213 --> 00:23:23.840
Whatever… We'll take care of it.

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:28.553
Thank you.

00:23:30.347 --> 00:23:33.475
You're not young anymore,
so enough of this "self-discovery" stuff.

00:23:33.975 --> 00:23:35.018
Bye.

00:23:42.234 --> 00:23:45.153
An announcement to all guests.

00:23:45.237 --> 00:23:47.280
We are terribly sorry,

00:23:47.364 --> 00:23:50.492
but today's sea lion show
will be canceled.

00:23:52.118 --> 00:23:55.038
An announcement to all guests.

00:23:55.121 --> 00:23:57.332
We are terribly sorry,

00:23:57.415 --> 00:24:00.585
but today's sea lion show
will be canceled.

00:24:08.093 --> 00:24:11.179
I wish I could've seen
the sea lions with you.

00:24:11.763 --> 00:24:13.014
Too bad.

00:24:16.559 --> 00:24:17.894
I'm sorry.

00:24:19.062 --> 00:24:21.940
This aquarium was supposed to be more fun.

00:24:22.691 --> 00:24:24.901
It's not your fault, Taiga.

00:24:26.319 --> 00:24:27.529
Well,

00:24:28.446 --> 00:24:30.240
I'm used to this, anyway.

00:24:31.324 --> 00:24:33.201
Used to what?

00:24:35.996 --> 00:24:40.333
Things not going according to plan.

00:24:42.961 --> 00:24:46.131
It's true that we've been
out of luck this whole day.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:51.344
But halfway through, I started to wonder,
"What's going to happen next?"

00:24:51.928 --> 00:24:53.763
And that was actually exciting.

00:24:55.974 --> 00:24:58.476
It's not that I don't have a plan.

00:24:59.227 --> 00:25:02.605
I just can't seem
to follow through with it.

00:25:07.193 --> 00:25:11.781
Nothing in my life
has ever gone according to plan.

00:25:17.454 --> 00:25:19.164
Compared to that,

00:25:20.415 --> 00:25:21.750
you are amazing, Rin.

00:25:22.542 --> 00:25:24.294
Why is that?

00:25:24.377 --> 00:25:26.588
You came to a foreign country on your own,

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:30.592
and you're moving forward
toward your dream.

00:25:30.675 --> 00:25:33.511
You have the ability to take action,

00:25:34.095 --> 00:25:35.430
and you have courage.

00:25:38.016 --> 00:25:41.561
Did you try making a bucket list?

00:25:42.771 --> 00:25:43.688
What?

00:25:45.732 --> 00:25:47.609
I don't have any dreams or anything.

00:25:48.485 --> 00:25:51.613
It doesn't have to be
something serious like that.

00:25:52.322 --> 00:25:57.077
Bucket lists can also help you find goals.

00:25:58.203 --> 00:26:00.080
The truth is,

00:26:00.163 --> 00:26:02.374
I set up a goal for myself today.

00:26:04.501 --> 00:26:06.795
Since you always cook for me,

00:26:07.295 --> 00:26:09.506
I wanted to cook for you today.

00:26:11.091 --> 00:26:13.635
But it was really hard.

00:26:15.261 --> 00:26:16.471
Take a look.

00:26:21.267 --> 00:26:24.145
Wow. They're huge.

00:26:24.229 --> 00:26:26.981
I thought that might make you happier.

00:26:29.776 --> 00:26:32.153
I'm still working on it.

00:26:36.658 --> 00:26:38.868
But I did my best.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.468
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

00:27:09.023 --> 00:27:11.317
- It's good.
- Really?

00:27:13.611 --> 00:27:14.654
Yes.

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:16.739
I'm glad.

00:27:20.368 --> 00:27:21.411
It's good.

00:27:24.539 --> 00:27:26.374
It's really good.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.376
Thank you.

00:27:35.884 --> 00:27:40.638
Thank you very much for visiting today.

00:27:41.264 --> 00:27:43.725
We will be closing soon.

00:27:44.309 --> 00:27:45.435
We look forward to…

00:27:48.438 --> 00:27:51.274
Taiga! We don't have to go out of our way!

00:27:51.357 --> 00:27:53.985
No! We should see the rays.

00:27:54.068 --> 00:27:56.029
They're in the biggest tank.

00:27:57.405 --> 00:27:59.073
We're almost there.

00:27:59.574 --> 00:28:00.408
‪CREATURES OF OARAI

00:28:02.535 --> 00:28:04.996
Excuse me. Can we go inside?

00:28:05.079 --> 00:28:07.081
Sorry, we closed it off.

00:28:07.165 --> 00:28:09.709
Please, let us in!

00:28:09.792 --> 00:28:12.378
Rules are rules. Sorry.

00:28:12.462 --> 00:28:15.673
Is there no way?
I really want her to see the rays.

00:28:15.757 --> 00:28:17.675
We'll leave as soon as we see them.

00:28:17.759 --> 00:28:21.471
Once we let a guest in,
the employees have to stay behind.

00:28:22.805 --> 00:28:24.516
Right…

00:28:26.309 --> 00:28:27.769
Sorry for troubling you.

00:28:27.852 --> 00:28:29.145
Sorry about that.

00:28:29.938 --> 00:28:32.023
Okay, good bye.

00:28:35.193 --> 00:28:36.110
Wait, Sir.

00:28:39.113 --> 00:28:42.325
I'll go patrol the other areas,
so during that time,

00:28:42.408 --> 00:28:43.618
you can go inside.

00:28:45.954 --> 00:28:47.622
Thank you!

00:28:48.915 --> 00:28:50.041
There it is!

00:28:50.124 --> 00:28:51.626
Gaoli. Ray.

00:28:52.752 --> 00:28:54.337
How cute!

00:28:56.965 --> 00:29:00.051
I'm so glad you got to see it.

00:29:05.765 --> 00:29:07.350
Wow…

00:29:08.434 --> 00:29:10.144
We have this place all to ourselves.

00:29:13.606 --> 00:29:15.483
We do.

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:45.179
- Taiga.
- Hey…

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:51.144
There is something I want to tell you.

00:29:54.522 --> 00:29:55.690
Yes?

00:30:04.741 --> 00:30:06.117
- Taiga, I--
- Today,

00:30:08.995 --> 00:30:11.581
this date didn't go as planned at all,

00:30:12.749 --> 00:30:16.753
and I felt like more and more
of a failure.

00:30:19.172 --> 00:30:22.884
But when I'm with you,

00:30:24.594 --> 00:30:27.889
I feel a weight off my shoulders.

00:30:29.974 --> 00:30:33.645
I feel like I can move forward.

00:30:47.325 --> 00:30:48.409
I…

00:30:50.703 --> 00:30:52.288
like you,

00:30:54.332 --> 00:30:55.541
Rin.

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:07.053
Will you please go out with me?

00:31:11.849 --> 00:31:12.809
Yes.

00:31:34.747 --> 00:31:36.249
Oh, that reminds me.

00:31:36.958 --> 00:31:39.168
I'll give this back to you.

00:31:41.754 --> 00:31:42.714
Thank you.

00:31:43.715 --> 00:31:46.009
But why now?

00:31:46.551 --> 00:31:50.888
Because now I don't need an excuse
to see you anymore.

00:31:54.308 --> 00:31:55.226
Thank you.

00:32:09.949 --> 00:32:12.410
I can't believe we're dating!

00:32:13.745 --> 00:32:15.872
Oh my god! What do I do?

00:32:25.423 --> 00:32:29.886
JUN-HO! BIG NEWS!

00:32:29.969 --> 00:32:33.765
‪TANOMI

00:32:34.474 --> 00:32:36.059
You'll definitely love this place.

00:32:36.142 --> 00:32:37.351
Really?

00:32:37.435 --> 00:32:38.352
I can't wait.

00:32:41.105 --> 00:32:43.941
I'll leave it up to you.
When you're done, I'll taste it.

00:32:44.025 --> 00:32:46.110
Okay. Thank you.

00:32:48.321 --> 00:32:50.782
- Good evening.
- Welcome.

00:32:50.865 --> 00:32:52.575
You came?

00:32:52.658 --> 00:32:55.953
Taiga, sorry for interrupting your work.
Do you have a second?

00:32:56.037 --> 00:32:57.580
Yes, he does.

00:32:59.874 --> 00:33:00.708
You do.

00:33:06.464 --> 00:33:07.298
Jun-ho.

00:33:14.972 --> 00:33:18.059
Hello. I'm Kang Jun-ho, Rin's senior.

00:33:18.142 --> 00:33:19.560
Nice to meet you.

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:24.023
Jun-ho?

00:33:25.149 --> 00:33:26.651
Nice to meet you.

00:33:27.235 --> 00:33:28.861
I'm Hase Taiga.

00:33:29.862 --> 00:33:32.532
He's been helping me since
I was going to college in Korea,

00:33:32.615 --> 00:33:34.367
so we've known each other for a long time.

00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:37.745
I confide in him a lot.
He's like a dependable older brother.

00:33:38.329 --> 00:33:40.581
Oh, really? From college?

00:33:42.667 --> 00:33:44.085
And this is…

00:33:46.587 --> 00:33:49.006
my boyfriend, Taiga.

00:33:56.055 --> 00:33:57.098
He looks nice.

00:33:57.181 --> 00:33:58.349
Right?

00:33:58.432 --> 00:33:59.934
He's a really good cook too.

00:34:00.601 --> 00:34:03.146
Let's have drinks together,

00:34:03.229 --> 00:34:05.439
and eat Taiga's cooking today.

00:34:09.777 --> 00:34:12.196
Rin, I'm sorry.

00:34:12.947 --> 00:34:16.325
There's an emergency
and I have to go back to work.

00:34:16.409 --> 00:34:18.119
But you said you finished work…

00:34:18.202 --> 00:34:21.038
There was some kind of trouble
and they need me in a hurry.

00:34:21.956 --> 00:34:22.790
I'm really sorry.

00:34:24.417 --> 00:34:26.210
He said he needs to rush back to work.

00:34:26.294 --> 00:34:27.128
What?

00:34:27.211 --> 00:34:29.422
I wanted to formally
introduce you guys, but…

00:34:29.505 --> 00:34:30.339
I'll go now.

00:34:40.558 --> 00:34:41.601
Bye.

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:02.246
That's hot!

00:35:09.462 --> 00:35:11.172
What's wrong?

00:35:11.255 --> 00:35:13.925
Were you dumped by a girl or something?

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:18.221
Yes. Is it that obvious?

00:35:18.304 --> 00:35:20.514
Wow, I was right.

00:35:20.598 --> 00:35:24.060
What? Why were you dumped?
You're so good looking.

00:35:24.143 --> 00:35:25.686
Did she have a man already?

00:35:30.274 --> 00:35:34.028
You just have to steal her away.

00:35:34.111 --> 00:35:35.696
I can't do that.

00:35:36.697 --> 00:35:38.532
That would make me the worst type of man…

00:35:43.329 --> 00:35:45.998
It's okay! It's okay!

00:35:46.082 --> 00:35:47.959
{\an8}That was delicious.

00:35:48.042 --> 00:35:50.211
{\an8}Your cooking is the best.

00:35:50.294 --> 00:35:51.212
{\an8}Thank you.

00:35:51.295 --> 00:35:53.673
{\an8}You really surprised me today, though.

00:35:54.382 --> 00:35:57.385
{\an8}I didn't think you would
bring Jun-ho out of the blue.

00:35:58.010 --> 00:35:59.262
{\an8}What?

00:35:59.345 --> 00:36:03.432
{\an8}I thought it was normal
to introduce my boyfriend to my friend.

00:36:04.016 --> 00:36:05.184
{\an8}Was that weird?

00:36:05.268 --> 00:36:07.019
{\an8}Not at all.

00:36:07.645 --> 00:36:11.023
{\an8}I'm happy you introduced me
to your senior.

00:36:11.565 --> 00:36:12.525
{\an8}Okay, good.

00:36:13.693 --> 00:36:14.944
{\an8}From now on,

00:36:15.569 --> 00:36:19.824
{\an8}let's tell each other whenever something
doesn't feel right.

00:36:22.368 --> 00:36:23.244
{\an8}Of course.

00:36:24.328 --> 00:36:26.956
{\an8}- I promise.
- Don't forget it.

00:36:45.308 --> 00:36:46.309
{\an8}There.

00:36:52.857 --> 00:36:54.567
The bucket list thing…

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:57.611
I'm thinking of doing it too.

00:36:58.404 --> 00:36:59.530
What?

00:36:59.613 --> 00:37:01.449
You found a goal?

00:37:40.112 --> 00:37:41.155
This.

00:37:51.957 --> 00:37:55.127
That's not what a bucket list is.

00:37:56.253 --> 00:37:57.505
Really?

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:05.346
A kiss isn't a life goal, is it?

00:38:06.389 --> 00:38:07.223
That's true.

00:38:07.807 --> 00:38:09.100
You're so funny.

00:38:09.767 --> 00:38:11.352
That's embarrassing.

00:38:12.353 --> 00:38:14.730
Yeah, it's embarrassing.

00:38:17.483 --> 00:38:18.609
But it made me happy.

00:38:25.074 --> 00:38:26.367
How embarrassing.

00:38:29.203 --> 00:38:30.830
{\an8}Are you embarrassed?

00:38:30.913 --> 00:38:31.956
{\an8}So cute.

00:38:33.124 --> 00:38:34.291
Whatever.

00:38:34.875 --> 00:38:36.544
Communication issues, huh?

00:38:36.627 --> 00:38:38.003
PREVIEW

00:38:38.087 --> 00:38:40.047
{\an8}Maybe it is difficult for two people

00:38:40.131 --> 00:38:42.133
{\an8}from different backgrounds to be together?

00:38:42.216 --> 00:38:43.050
