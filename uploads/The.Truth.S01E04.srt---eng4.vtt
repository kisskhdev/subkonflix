=Episode 04=

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.632
Captain Leng.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.776
What did the reporter say?

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.521
He is a villager from Shuangta Village.

00:02:08.521 --> 00:02:09.801
His family owns this land.

00:02:09.801 --> 00:02:10.560
It's remote here.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.521
Hardly anyone comes.

00:02:12.081 --> 00:02:13.440
According to the reporter,

00:02:13.521 --> 00:02:15.000
he lost a sheep

00:02:15.241 --> 00:02:16.400
and never found it.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.921
So he came to try his luck,

00:02:17.921 --> 00:02:19.041
and discovered the victim.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.241
Captain Leng.

00:02:20.241 --> 00:02:22.041
Is this the crime scene

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:23.280
or the scene of body dumping?

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.041
It's definitely the crime scene.

00:02:25.761 --> 00:02:27.641
The killer slit the victim's

00:02:27.641 --> 00:02:28.880
carotid artery in one cut.

00:02:29.321 --> 00:02:31.160
The victim didn't die immediately

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.081
and fell from right here.

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:36.440
If it were a scene of body dumping,

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.921
there should be dripping blood

00:02:39.081 --> 00:02:40.720
trails on this road.

00:02:41.641 --> 00:02:42.680
The reporter mentioned

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.961
he has never seen the victim.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.481
So the victim isn't a local.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.801
Heading east

00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:49.120
on that road about a kilometer or so

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.160
is the national highway.

00:03:03.801 --> 00:03:05.160
Tire marks of a motorcycle.

00:03:06.921 --> 00:03:08.241
Or of an electric bike.

00:03:13.081 --> 00:03:14.481
Why do I smell engine oil?

00:03:16.641 --> 00:03:17.801
Engine oil smell?

00:03:20.761 --> 00:03:21.921
What a nose you have.

00:03:37.761 --> 00:03:38.560
Zhua.

00:03:40.321 --> 00:03:42.081
You need to fix this.

00:03:43.921 --> 00:03:45.600
Don't think being around me for long

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.921
allows you to break the rules.

00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:48.840
If it happens again,

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.361
pack your bags and get lost!

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.000
I'm sorry, really. I'm sorry.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.641
Apologize to Qing.

00:04:00.361 --> 00:04:01.160
Qing.

00:04:03.241 --> 00:04:03.921
I'm sorry.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.400
Well,

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.921
this Bao Hei still hasn't shown up.

00:04:11.481 --> 00:04:12.961
We're stuck in limbo here.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.761
What's our next move?

00:04:17.961 --> 00:04:18.761
No rush.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.160
Let them come to us.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.201
Dad,

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.121
did I wake you?

00:04:50.641 --> 00:04:52.240
You went grocery shopping?

00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:56.561
I've told you

00:04:56.881 --> 00:04:58.360
not to buy that much.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.240
You only come back
from school on weekends,

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.561
and I work overtime every day,

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.321
hardly come back.

00:05:05.321 --> 00:05:06.920
No one cooks here.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.521
All this you bought will just rot away.

00:05:11.441 --> 00:05:13.840
Dad, I graduated long ago.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.920
And you've been retired for years.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.681
I know that.

00:05:22.961 --> 00:05:23.681
Pick up the phone.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.040
Jiao.

00:05:35.441 --> 00:05:37.240
Okay, I'll handle it.

00:05:48.876 --> 00:05:52.568
(Asepsis Testing Room)

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:38.200
(Trace comparing. Please wait.)

00:06:42.028 --> 00:06:43.032
(Trace comparing. Please wait.)

00:06:43.148 --> 00:06:45.144
(No matching trace found.
Update database or enter more samples)

00:06:51.521 --> 00:06:52.240
Captain Leng.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.840
I checked all accessible surveillance

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.681
near the scene.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.761
Found no valuable leads.

00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:02.881
We can see

00:07:02.881 --> 00:07:04.280
the wound on the right is deeper.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.224
Judging by the force application points,
the killer should be a lefty.

00:07:07.521 --> 00:07:10.360
The victim has multiple bruises
and abrasions on his body,

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.280
likely sustained
during a violent struggle

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.264
before being pinned down
and slit in the throat.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.720
A small amount of cash
was found on the victim,

00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:20.321
but no cell phone or ID.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.800
It's been raining continuously
since the crime,

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.561
and the scene is all grassland.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.360
We found no valuable footprints.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:28.961
But we did find

00:07:28.961 --> 00:07:30.400
tire marks from a motorcycle.

00:07:30.881 --> 00:07:32.641
The forensic unit
found soaked engine oil

00:07:32.641 --> 00:07:33.920
in the mud samples.

00:07:34.321 --> 00:07:35.321
The forensic unit

00:07:35.321 --> 00:07:36.720
confirms it's for motorcycles.

00:07:37.521 --> 00:07:39.441
Additionally, the victim's palms

00:07:39.441 --> 00:07:40.561
have noticeable calluses.

00:07:40.881 --> 00:07:42.441
We found a pair of knee pads

00:07:42.441 --> 00:07:43.641
on the victim's clothing.

00:07:43.961 --> 00:07:45.400
They're very worn,

00:07:45.521 --> 00:07:47.720
showing repeated folds and abrasions.

00:07:48.121 --> 00:07:49.961
I assumed at first

00:07:49.961 --> 00:07:51.961
he might be
a long-term motorcycle rider.

00:07:52.441 --> 00:07:53.840
Possibly even

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.360
worked in a motorcycle-related industry.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.800
But a new clue came in later.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.321
Estimated time of death is after 10 PM.

00:08:01.681 --> 00:08:03.040
And the crime scene

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:03.920
is extremely remote,

00:08:04.201 --> 00:08:05.240
with no one living nearby.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.576
So people who work
in food delivery, couriers,

00:08:07.576 --> 00:08:09.528
and other motorcycle-related businesses,

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.096
wouldn't go there.

00:08:11.096 --> 00:08:11.681
So now,

00:08:11.681 --> 00:08:13.280
I'm stuck in a dead end.

00:08:14.641 --> 00:08:15.681
It's impossible for this

00:08:16.001 --> 00:08:17.641
to be roadside robbery-and-murder.

00:08:18.001 --> 00:08:19.001
In the dead of night,

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.641
it's unlikely the victim
was transporting goods.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.881
There's only one possibility.

00:08:22.881 --> 00:08:24.480
He was transporting the killer.

00:08:24.696 --> 00:08:25.840
After reaching the location,

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.321
the killer killed him

00:08:27.321 --> 00:08:28.480
and stole the motorcycle.

00:08:29.001 --> 00:08:30.001
Based on this analysis,

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.801
the victim

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.441
was likely a motorcycle taxi driver.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.441
Ye Qian.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.840
Contact the forensic unit immediately

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.081
and have them produce
a facial photo of the body

00:08:41.081 --> 00:08:41.880
as soon as possible.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.288
Then write an investigation notice

00:08:43.681 --> 00:08:44.961
and print 200 copies.

00:08:45.041 --> 00:08:46.840
Liu Yang, two tasks for you.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:47.681
First,

00:08:47.681 --> 00:08:48.760
go to the command center

00:08:49.281 --> 00:08:50.921
and check if any missing person reports

00:08:50.921 --> 00:08:52.401
were filed within the last 48 hours.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.561
Second, once the investigation notice
is ready,

00:08:55.561 --> 00:08:57.120
distribute it to the train stations,

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.880
high-speed rail stations,
coach terminals,

00:08:58.880 --> 00:08:59.561
docks,

00:08:59.561 --> 00:09:01.000
and other motorcycle taxi hotspots.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.520
See if we can identify the victim.

00:09:04.401 --> 00:09:04.961
Got it.

00:09:16.459 --> 00:09:16.984
(Yunxi Police)

00:09:17.035 --> 00:09:18.648
(After issuing
the investigation notice,)

00:09:18.699 --> 00:09:20.792
(victim identified as Xu Gang,
motorcycle taxi driver.)

00:09:20.961 --> 00:09:22.041
Zhang Meifeng, right?

00:09:23.281 --> 00:09:24.760
We'd like to ask you a few questions

00:09:25.081 --> 00:09:26.520
about your husband, Xu Gang.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:28.801
Officer,

00:09:28.961 --> 00:09:31.720
h-has something happened to my husband?

00:09:35.161 --> 00:09:36.360
Could you first tell us

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.000
about your family situation?

00:09:38.921 --> 00:09:39.880
Our family

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.240
has six members, including me.

00:09:44.921 --> 00:09:46.480
There's me, my husband,

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.720
our two kids,

00:09:48.201 --> 00:09:49.480
and his parents.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.081
What did he usually do for work?

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.561
He drove a motorcycle taxi.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.360
Wait, he...

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.161
What exactly happened?

00:10:09.041 --> 00:10:09.801
Qiming.

00:10:13.801 --> 00:10:15.480
They are the victim's children?

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:16.561
Yes.

00:10:16.801 --> 00:10:18.600
His mother is being questioned upstairs.

00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:21.161
The children insisted on
coming out to play.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.201
I'm looking after them.

00:10:25.081 --> 00:10:25.961
I'll take over.

00:10:28.281 --> 00:10:29.000
Well,

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.000
Xu Gang

00:10:31.801 --> 00:10:33.161
wasn't well-off.

00:10:34.081 --> 00:10:35.480
His wife didn't have a job,

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.201
and had to raise two young children.

00:10:39.321 --> 00:10:40.401
Life is hard.

00:10:43.161 --> 00:10:43.800
By the way,

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.880
how's Xiaoyu doing lately?

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:46.961
Elementary school yet?

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.041
After they moved to Shanghai,

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.081
we lost touch.

00:10:52.401 --> 00:10:54.081
Just an occasional call during holidays.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.321
His mother

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.760
remarried.

00:11:07.961 --> 00:11:10.240
You texted me that day.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.120
What's wrong?

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.401
Nothing.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.760
Alright. Thank you.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.801
Hey kids.

00:11:35.467 --> 00:11:37.760
(Yunxi Police)

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.760
Why?

00:11:46.401 --> 00:11:47.081
Thank you.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.961
How long had he been
a motorcycle taxi driver?

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.760
Over three years.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:04.880
How was the income?

00:12:06.681 --> 00:12:07.561
Just okay.

00:12:07.921 --> 00:12:10.840
Barely enough to feed the family.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.801
Where did he usually pick up fares?

00:12:17.081 --> 00:12:18.961
The train stations,

00:12:19.561 --> 00:12:20.880
coach terminals,

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.961
and the wholesale markets.

00:12:25.041 --> 00:12:28.520
Basically, wherever there are crowds.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.840
What brand was his motorcycle?

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.120
Was it licensed?

00:12:33.132 --> 00:12:35.081
(Yunxi Police)

00:12:35.081 --> 00:12:38.321
The motorcycle was a Dayang,

00:12:39.401 --> 00:12:41.360
but it didn't have a license plate.

00:12:43.081 --> 00:12:45.681
Did the motorcycle have
any distinctive features?

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.401
Something that made it stand out?

00:12:49.561 --> 00:12:51.081
Do stickers count?

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.321
What stickers?

00:12:53.681 --> 00:12:54.760
Where are they?

00:12:55.801 --> 00:12:58.520
The stickers kids like.

00:12:58.801 --> 00:13:00.321
He spoiled the two kids.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.961
Basically, the whole motorcycle
was covered in them.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.480
What's Xu Gang's phone number?

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.880
135

00:13:11.921 --> 00:13:13.161
2301...

00:13:15.321 --> 00:13:17.801
(Please catch)

00:13:18.281 --> 00:13:20.041
(the person
who killed my husband, okay?)

00:13:20.321 --> 00:13:21.000
Of course.

00:13:22.681 --> 00:13:23.600
Wen, see her out.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.281
Mr. Xu.

00:14:20.161 --> 00:14:21.201
Is this Mr. Xu?

00:14:58.961 --> 00:15:00.840
Why are you pulling that long face

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.401
all day long?

00:15:03.921 --> 00:15:05.561
Not a smile at all.

00:15:05.643 --> 00:15:08.041
(Yunxi Police)

00:15:08.041 --> 00:15:08.681
Get out.

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:14.561
Get back here.

00:15:15.321 --> 00:15:16.840
Why so obedient?

00:15:17.681 --> 00:15:18.401
Sit here.

00:15:25.921 --> 00:15:26.760
Smile.

00:15:33.401 --> 00:15:34.360
Tell me about the case.

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.240
Xu Gang was from Dongshan District.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.441
His family background
wasn't complicated.

00:15:42.801 --> 00:15:43.840
His parents were farmers,

00:15:44.321 --> 00:15:45.681
and his wife didn't work.

00:15:46.681 --> 00:15:48.360
According to people around Xu Gang,

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.281
he was usually kind and easygoing,

00:15:50.648 --> 00:15:52.640
hardly argued with anyone.

00:15:53.161 --> 00:15:55.161
So the chances of him
having financial disputes

00:15:55.161 --> 00:15:56.880
or grudges against anyone were very low.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:58.640
I suspect

00:15:58.961 --> 00:16:01.321
it was most likely a robbery-and-murder,
done on impulse.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:02.880
Go on.

00:16:03.561 --> 00:16:06.760
The killer didn't take the cash
on the victim.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.961
And that Dayang motorcycle

00:16:08.961 --> 00:16:10.321
was second-hand,

00:16:10.441 --> 00:16:11.600
worth little.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.760
So I think the killer

00:16:16.681 --> 00:16:18.000
stole the motorcycle

00:16:18.321 --> 00:16:20.321
solely to use it as a getaway vehicle.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.360
Nowadays, we have to use ID

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.401
to take planes, high-speed rails

00:16:26.961 --> 00:16:28.161
and coaches.

00:16:29.081 --> 00:16:29.961
Think about it.

00:16:30.161 --> 00:16:33.201
Who would give up
such convenient methods to flee

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.880
after committing murder,
and stole a motorcycle?

00:16:38.081 --> 00:16:39.801
This guy is already wanted?

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:43.801
It's me.

00:16:45.561 --> 00:16:46.640
Where are you now?

00:16:46.961 --> 00:16:47.801
On the way.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.120
Is the stuff ready?

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:51.760
Been ready for a while.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.081
Just waiting for you.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.600
Have you mentioned
my business to anyone?

00:17:02.921 --> 00:17:03.880
No,

00:17:04.121 --> 00:17:05.201
just get here.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.760
Where exactly are you now?

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.961
Need me to come get you?

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.601
I'll arrive tonight. Contact later.

00:17:14.361 --> 00:17:15.040
Hello.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.361
0.5 yuan.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:29.681
No change for that.

00:17:29.681 --> 00:17:30.760
Use WeChat or Alipay?

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:33.921
Don't have them.

00:17:37.643 --> 00:17:38.616
(Wanted: Major criminal case)

00:17:38.616 --> 00:17:39.544
(The wanted suspect
He Changchun is at large.)

00:17:39.544 --> 00:17:40.152
(He Changchun's photo)

00:17:51.681 --> 00:17:52.480
Mr. Liao.

00:17:53.121 --> 00:17:55.361
I've said and done everything you asked.

00:17:56.121 --> 00:17:56.921
Well...

00:17:56.921 --> 00:17:58.000
(Captain Liao)
He called using a landline.

00:17:58.156 --> 00:17:59.800
(Chenguan Police Department, Liuhe City
Criminal Police Unit)

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.720
Trace the location of this number.

00:18:01.961 --> 00:18:02.681
Okay.

00:18:04.881 --> 00:18:06.240
He used a cell phone

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.601
to contact you last time?

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:08.881
Right.

00:18:09.921 --> 00:18:11.601
Did that number belong to He Changchun?

00:18:15.201 --> 00:18:17.441
I really don't know that.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.401
He didn't tell me.

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.201
I tried calling it back later,
but someone else answered.

00:18:24.921 --> 00:18:26.480
He's really cunning.

00:18:26.961 --> 00:18:27.760
What's the number?

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:29.601
It's in my phone.

00:18:33.441 --> 00:18:34.240
Here it is.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:37.560
Trace this one too.

00:18:40.641 --> 00:18:41.881
If he contacts you again,

00:18:42.361 --> 00:18:43.681
report to us immediately.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.280
Okay.

00:20:16.441 --> 00:20:17.881
Hello, Chief Xu.

00:20:18.361 --> 00:20:19.040
Qiming.

00:20:19.201 --> 00:20:20.921
About the motorcycle taxi driver case,

00:20:20.921 --> 00:20:22.720
how's the progress going?

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.361
A single perpetrator.

00:20:24.401 --> 00:20:26.361
The killer is a lefty.

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:27.881
Analysis indicates

00:20:27.881 --> 00:20:29.760
he was the fare
Xu Gang picked up that night.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.841
Both Ye Qian and I believe

00:20:32.201 --> 00:20:34.601
he stole that motorcycle to flee.

00:20:34.921 --> 00:20:36.800
I bet he's wanted for other crimes.

00:20:37.641 --> 00:20:39.520
He killed for a motorcycle.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.000
Then the case he's involved in
must be major.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.401
So I've been reviewing

00:20:43.401 --> 00:20:45.280
major cases in provinces and cities

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.280
near Yunxi recently.

00:20:46.601 --> 00:20:48.841
The suspect
in the Liuhe City family massacre case,

00:20:49.401 --> 00:20:51.961
both in physical characteristics
and modus operandi,

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.800
has something in common with our case.

00:20:55.401 --> 00:20:57.201
I've contacted
the involving police station.

00:20:57.201 --> 00:20:58.361
They're all on the case.

00:20:58.921 --> 00:21:00.240
No time today.

00:21:01.641 --> 00:21:03.480
We'll have a video conference tomorrow

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.201
to touch base.

00:21:30.601 --> 00:21:31.800
You go back.

00:21:32.641 --> 00:21:33.841
I'll stay here.

00:21:35.601 --> 00:21:37.760
He probably won't wake up
until tomorrow.

00:21:40.841 --> 00:21:42.080
Let's go back together.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.441
I'll come early tomorrow myself.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.601
If anything comes up,

00:21:46.921 --> 00:21:48.280
I'll let you know.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.000
Let's go.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:36.921
Help!

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:09.841
(My dad left this plot of land to me.)

00:23:09.961 --> 00:23:11.361
(You can't just claim it's yours.)

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.441
How dare you sue my dad?

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:16.480
Dad!

00:23:17.401 --> 00:23:18.441
Dad!

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.040
Dad!

00:23:29.641 --> 00:23:30.401
Dad!

00:23:53.921 --> 00:23:55.512
I'm telling you, with me here,

00:23:55.512 --> 00:23:58.000
I won't allow him to be buried
in the family ancestral grave.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:58.520
Right!

00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.720
This is too much!

00:23:59.841 --> 00:24:00.681
Son!

00:24:01.161 --> 00:24:02.961
Calm down, son!

00:24:08.056 --> 00:24:08.961
What are you doing?

00:24:08.961 --> 00:24:10.480
- I'll burn more joss paper.
- How dare you!

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.161
- What are you doing? Give it to me!
- You can't sign it!

00:24:12.161 --> 00:24:13.841
You! Let go! Give it to me!

00:24:13.841 --> 00:24:14.401
Can't sign it!

00:24:14.401 --> 00:24:15.121
Give it to me!

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:17.601
Can't sign it!

00:24:51.161 --> 00:24:52.480
This is Captain Liao

00:24:52.601 --> 00:24:54.201
from Chenguan County, Liuhe City.

00:24:55.681 --> 00:24:56.280
Captain Liao.

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.760
Okay, let me brief the situation.

00:25:01.401 --> 00:25:02.240
(Suspect's ID photo and details)
He Changchun,

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.080
(Name: He Changchun)
male, 23 years old,

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.601
from He Village, Xinxiang,
Chenguan County, Liuhe City.

00:25:08.841 --> 00:25:09.720
One week ago,

00:25:10.121 --> 00:25:11.704
(Crime scene photos)
he fatally stabbed his uncle,

00:25:11.832 --> 00:25:12.641
He Shanxiang,

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:13.816
his aunt, Zhang Cuifang,

00:25:13.816 --> 00:25:14.401
(Photos
of victim Zhang Cuifang's neck wound)

00:25:14.401 --> 00:25:15.401
his cousin, He Hongqing,

00:25:16.121 --> 00:25:18.040
and He Hongqing's wife, Li Juan.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.080
Captain Liao.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.720
He killed four of his own relatives.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.000
What was his motive?

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:25.201
We believe

00:25:25.201 --> 00:25:27.401
the motive stems from conflict.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.080
According to informants,

00:25:29.121 --> 00:25:29.881
the victims' family

00:25:29.881 --> 00:25:32.040
had long occupied land
of He Changchun's family.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.841
Mediations from the village committee
didn't work at all.

00:25:37.161 --> 00:25:39.361
Moreover, He Shanxiang
and his son He Hongqing

00:25:40.201 --> 00:25:42.641
had bullied, humiliated, and beaten
He Changchun's parents.

00:25:43.601 --> 00:25:45.441
They even obstructed
his father's burial.

00:25:46.361 --> 00:25:48.320
But He Changchun
never reported this to police.

00:25:48.921 --> 00:25:50.201
We only learned these details

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.080
after the crime by asking informants.

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.560
On the night of the crime,

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:55.681
villagers witnessed

00:25:55.841 --> 00:25:58.000
He Changchun
hastily leaving the village.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.161
And he had bloodstains on him.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.520
Later, someone went
to He Hongqing's house to check.

00:26:03.628 --> 00:26:04.161
(Crime scene photos
of He Shanxiang's murder)

00:26:04.161 --> 00:26:06.776
Then they discovered
all four family members murdered.

00:26:06.776 --> 00:26:07.288
(He Shanxiang, Zhang Cuifang
and He Hongqing)

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.921
Only He Hongqing's
four-year-old son remained.

00:26:13.361 --> 00:26:15.401
That child was unharmed.

00:26:16.601 --> 00:26:19.641
Fortunately, the neighbor opposite
the victims' house had surveillance.

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.921
We immediately retrieved the footage,

00:26:22.641 --> 00:26:25.401
capturing video of He Changchun
fleeing the scene.

00:26:25.841 --> 00:26:26.720
Check the screenshots.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.240
(Screenshots
of He Changchun fleeing scene)

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.720
While issuing the warrant,

00:26:28.961 --> 00:26:31.441
we immediately investigated
He Changchun's

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000
known associates.

00:26:33.201 --> 00:26:34.401
Shortly after the incident,

00:26:34.641 --> 00:26:35.881
He Changchun contacted

00:26:35.881 --> 00:26:37.280
a man named Wang Lei.

00:26:38.201 --> 00:26:41.000
Wang Lei was He Changchun's
middle school classmate.

00:26:41.272 --> 00:26:43.201
He runs a business in downtown Liuhe.

00:26:44.201 --> 00:26:46.240
He Changchun sought him out
to borrow money.

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.280
Following our instructions,

00:26:48.344 --> 00:26:50.200
Wang Lei agreed to lend money
to He Changchun.

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.280
Thus, we set up surveillance

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.800
along the route from Chenguan County

00:26:54.441 --> 00:26:56.312
(Wang Lei and photos around his office)
and around Wang Lei's house

00:26:56.312 --> 00:26:57.320
and workplace.

00:26:57.961 --> 00:26:59.361
But we never expected

00:26:59.961 --> 00:27:02.601
He Changchun would
commit a crime in Yunxi.

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:04.560
A diversionary tactic.

00:27:05.601 --> 00:27:06.841
He made police

00:27:06.841 --> 00:27:08.921
focus on Liuhe and Wang Lei.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.641
So he could escape
out of the province via Yunxi.

00:27:12.841 --> 00:27:14.441
Up to now, He Changchun

00:27:14.441 --> 00:27:16.201
has contacted Wang Lei
three times in total.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.401
He used the village's landline

00:27:18.401 --> 00:27:19.841
at the night of the crime.

00:27:20.161 --> 00:27:21.121
The other two times,

00:27:21.121 --> 00:27:22.520
once he used a cell phone.

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:24.881
This is the cell phone number.

00:27:28.921 --> 00:27:30.240
This is Xu Gang's number.

00:27:32.201 --> 00:27:35.320
The most recent call from this number
was also from a landline.

00:27:35.681 --> 00:27:38.040
Its location
is near National Highway 322,

00:27:39.352 --> 00:27:41.592
about 20 kilometers from Linshui Town.

00:27:41.592 --> 00:27:42.201
(Crime scene photos)

00:27:42.201 --> 00:27:43.448
Yesterday afternoon,

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.560
a middle-aged woman
was killed in that area,

00:27:45.881 --> 00:27:47.280
also slit to death with a knife.

00:27:48.361 --> 00:27:50.800
Contact the local police department now.

00:27:53.441 --> 00:27:54.760
Okay, thanks.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.921
Get some rest.

00:28:01.201 --> 00:28:01.881
Hello.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.560
A colleague from traffic division said,

00:28:05.201 --> 00:28:06.480
according to his description,

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.720
the physical characteristics
match He Changchun.

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.921
We just got word

00:28:13.681 --> 00:28:14.921
that He Changchun

00:28:14.921 --> 00:28:18.361
stabbed a colleague
from the traffic division.

00:28:19.121 --> 00:28:21.841
If the Linshui Town case is his doing,

00:28:22.361 --> 00:28:23.320
then

00:28:23.601 --> 00:28:25.161
during his escape,

00:28:25.921 --> 00:28:27.800
he has claimed seven victims in total.

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.080
I need to stay a while longer.

00:28:45.681 --> 00:28:47.480
Did you change my tea today?

00:28:47.841 --> 00:28:49.641
The taste seems off.

00:28:53.921 --> 00:28:55.280
I didn't notice.

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.881
Alright then, you get back to work.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:58.841
I'm hanging up.

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.040

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.601
Dad, time for your medicine.

00:30:03.361 --> 00:30:04.000
No.

00:30:04.881 --> 00:30:05.601
I don't take it.

00:30:07.681 --> 00:30:09.080
If you don't take your medicine,

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:11.480
your head will hurt tomorrow morning.

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:12.201
No.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.240
Be good, take one pill.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.000
- Here.
- No.

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:17.040
Just one.

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.121
You want to kill me?

00:30:19.121 --> 00:30:19.921
Do you?

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:22.681
Don't think I don't know.

00:30:22.681 --> 00:30:24.401
You're with them.

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.921
You implanted a chip in my brain

00:30:26.921 --> 00:30:27.921
and set up an antenna!

00:30:29.641 --> 00:30:31.201
Talking to me day and night.

00:30:31.361 --> 00:30:32.401
Won't even let me sleep.

00:30:32.401 --> 00:30:33.560
Just trying to kill me!

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:34.401
Medicine?

00:30:34.921 --> 00:30:36.520
What for?

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:38.040
Is this medicine?

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:41.401
Is this medicine?

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.240
It's a battery.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:44.520
Medicine?

00:30:44.841 --> 00:30:46.681
Why let me take medicine?

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:47.441
You!

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:51.921
Take it.

00:30:53.681 --> 00:30:55.240
Take it.

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.320
Come in, all of you!

00:30:58.601 --> 00:30:59.841

- Here to send us food?
- Yes.

Yes. It's an old problem.

- It's fine.

this is the moment I enjoy most

I loved eating since I was a kid,

00:35:17.441 --> 00:35:18.480
so I wanted to open

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.361
a restaurant and become a chef
when I grow up.

00:35:21.401 --> 00:35:22.841
That'd be comfortable.

00:35:22.841 --> 00:35:23.961
But my parents objected.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.441
They thought it was too exhausting

00:35:26.441 --> 00:35:28.120
and wanted me to get an easier job.

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.552
It doesn't matter if I can earn much,
as long as I was happy.

00:35:30.881 --> 00:35:32.120
Now, I become a policeman

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:33.961
and realize it's exhausting too.

00:35:37.841 --> 00:35:39.256
Are you happy being a policeman?

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.361

00:36:31.881 --> 00:36:33.921

00:36:40.961 --> 00:36:42.401
You don't know?

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.281
I'm asking how much this watch is.

Captain Leng,

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.160
it's a birthday gift from someone.

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:51.200
- I don't...
- I didn't ask who gave it to you.

00:36:51.401 --> 00:36:53.401
I'm asking how much this watch is.

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:56.321
If you don't know,

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:57.600
go back to your division.

00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.200
There's no work for you here.

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.080
No, I'm not going back.

00:37:02.801 --> 00:37:04.640
I join your unit to catch criminals.

00:37:04.801 --> 00:37:05.721
Catch every single one.

00:37:12.401 --> 00:37:13.761
In your division,

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:15.600
the case-solving rate is 90 percent.

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:18.680
Sometimes you even
steal cases from our unit.

00:37:19.401 --> 00:37:20.721
That was you, wasn't it?

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:23.401
Yes.

00:37:27.761 --> 00:37:28.961
You suit here.

Welcome to Major Crimes Unit.

00:37:33.241 --> 00:37:35.600
I was just messing with you earlier.

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:39.160
There are many criminals
waiting for your arrest.

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:41.600
You've come to the right place.

00:37:44.241 --> 00:37:45.721
That's your spot over there. Go.

00:37:50.961 --> 00:37:52.120
I heard from Captain Leng

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.928
your family was well-off
when you were young.

00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.761
Generally speaking, someone like you

00:37:59.441 --> 00:38:00.961
rarely becomes a criminal policeman.

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:06.080
Because of her?

00:38:10.921 --> 00:38:14.680
You know Little Zhao's been
waiting for you, right?

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.961
I've made things clear
with her about this.

00:38:20.721 --> 00:38:21.520
Qian.

00:38:24.241 --> 00:38:25.721
Do you have even the slightest

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:29.040
thought about trying to accept her?

00:38:29.361 --> 00:38:30.080
No.

00:38:32.761 --> 00:38:33.401
Alright.

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:36.480
Love really can't be forced.

00:38:37.304 --> 00:38:40.441
You love her, yet she doesn't love you.
She loves you, yet you don't love her.

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:41.841
Can you just eat?

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:44.841
Alright.

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:03.841
I'll go to Han Zhao tomorrow.

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:05.801
Wait,

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:08.120
you said you have no feelings to her.

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:09.441
Why do you go to her again?

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:23.281
Little Qian.

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.961
Where's your little shadow today?

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:27.441
I'm working.

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.961
You could just call me
to ask about the motorcycle.

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:32.480
Why bother coming here?

00:39:32.961 --> 00:39:33.761
Missed me?

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:36.241
This is important.

00:39:36.241 --> 00:39:37.361
Better talked in person.

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.600
Alright. What is it?

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.000
You know the motorcycle circle

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:42.881
in Wannan, right?

00:39:43.401 --> 00:39:45.480
Any way to track down this motorcycle?

00:39:48.281 --> 00:39:49.801
Dayang DY150.

00:39:49.801 --> 00:39:50.881
Most common model.

00:39:52.281 --> 00:39:53.401
Not easy to find.

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:56.080
But those stickers are pretty unique.

00:39:56.281 --> 00:39:57.480
If they're all peeled off,

00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:59.544
it's just like any other motorcycle
on the street.

00:40:00.321 --> 00:40:01.721
This is secondhand,

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.040
not well maintained.

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:04.401
Might even have an oil leak.

00:40:04.841 --> 00:40:07.281
Oil leak? That's great.

00:40:07.448 --> 00:40:09.401
If all the oil leaks out,
the engine will seize,

00:40:09.401 --> 00:40:10.401
then it'll need repairs.

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:13.680
Send me
its vehicle identification number

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.080
and engine number.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.560
I'll spread the word.

00:40:21.281 --> 00:40:22.080
A friend of mine

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:24.040
deals in used motorcycle parts.

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:24.881
He's in a group chat

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:26.961
with all the dealers.

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:29.801
If this motorcycle
hasn't left the province,

00:40:29.801 --> 00:40:31.921
we could track it down.

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:33.680
Perfect! Thanks.

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.401
Since you're here, stay for a meal.

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:37.721
I'm working.

00:40:38.801 --> 00:40:40.961
One meal won't hinder anything.

00:40:44.961 --> 00:40:46.640
What work? Delivering packages?

00:40:49.281 --> 00:40:50.881
Notify me once you get any leads.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:51.680
Thank you.

00:40:55.281 --> 00:40:56.680
Did you find anything on Chen Yumo?

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:08.480
It's been years.
Stop wasting your effort.

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:13.000
There are plenty of fish in the sea.

00:41:17.921 --> 00:41:20.000
Can't you see me right here?

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:04.080
Did you dig up

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:05.080
Dan Qing's background?

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:08.480
It's all in here.

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:15.820
(Profile of Dan Qing (Chen Yumo))

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:22.281
Interesting.

00:42:24.721 --> 00:42:25.640
Interesting.
