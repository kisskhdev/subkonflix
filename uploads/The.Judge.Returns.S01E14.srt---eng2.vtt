WEBVTT

00:00:32.345 --> 00:00:35.056
THE JUDGE RETURNS

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:38.559
FINAL EPISODE

00:00:38.643 --> 00:00:42.104
MAKDONG RESTAURANT

00:00:42.188 --> 00:00:44.315
RESTAURANT CLOSED
WE CLOSED AS OF AUGUST

00:00:48.235 --> 00:00:49.737
It's Suni's Sundae Soup Restaurant.

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:52.531
The restaurant closed for good last month.

00:00:52.615 --> 00:00:53.949
You'll be safe here.

00:01:01.332 --> 00:01:02.583
Pink?

00:01:06.796 --> 00:01:08.506
You chose these on purpose, didn't you?

00:01:08.589 --> 00:01:10.132
I got a car under someone else's name.

00:01:11.092 --> 00:01:12.176
The phone is a bonus.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.097
This is cash.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.973
It has
a 60-month interest-free installment plan.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.310
Don't run away with the money.
You're a judge.

00:01:25.231 --> 00:01:26.816
I was so proud to have
a judge as a friend!

00:01:28.192 --> 00:01:29.735
Sin-jin, that bastard!

00:01:33.614 --> 00:01:36.117
- Calm down.
- I'm just so sad!

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.201
Still, calm down.

00:01:43.708 --> 00:01:45.000
You're bleeding from your neck

00:01:45.626 --> 00:01:46.627
and coughing.

00:02:07.982 --> 00:02:09.442
I can't let you

00:02:10.526 --> 00:02:12.611
kill me twice.

00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:18.868
Right, Sin-jin?

00:02:40.264 --> 00:02:41.348
We meet again.

00:02:42.767 --> 00:02:44.560
I hear you were very worried about me.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.612
What happened?

00:02:56.155 --> 00:02:58.908
Sin-jin tried to overthrow Suojae.

00:02:58.991 --> 00:03:00.493
That was how Gyo-hun got killed.

00:03:01.535 --> 00:03:05.039
And you're returning to Seoul
because I said I needed you.

00:03:05.498 --> 00:03:07.333
I asked Mr. Baek to move you back.

00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:09.460
That's great.

00:03:10.002 --> 00:03:12.838
Yong-hyeon will be so happy
to see me back in Seoul.

00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:16.342
Let's get to work.

00:03:22.473 --> 00:03:24.725
I thought you'd be gone for good.

00:03:27.812 --> 00:03:29.396
I'm impressed that you made it back.

00:03:32.775 --> 00:03:34.193
It's just a witness questioning.

00:03:34.276 --> 00:03:36.529
How nice is it that I get to say hi?
I love that.

00:03:39.865 --> 00:03:40.866
Gosh

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.701
I didn't know young people these days

00:03:42.785 --> 00:03:45.579
had the nerve to haul an old man in
just to say hello.

00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:49.291
What a tough world it is.

00:03:50.751 --> 00:03:52.586
The world has gone crazy!

00:04:06.308 --> 00:04:07.601
Hello.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.854
We're closed for the day.

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:16.610
Hello.

00:04:18.362 --> 00:04:20.614
I'm Mr. Lee's colleague.

00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:38.048
His surgery went well

00:04:38.132 --> 00:04:39.300
and he's doing fine.

00:04:39.675 --> 00:04:40.759
Really?

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.428
- Yes.
- So...

00:04:42.511 --> 00:04:43.888
You're sure

00:04:43.971 --> 00:04:45.389
our Han-young is safe?

00:04:45.472 --> 00:04:46.473
Yeah.

00:04:46.932 --> 00:04:48.642
So, don't worry at all.

00:04:48.726 --> 00:04:50.102
Don't skip your meals

00:04:50.185 --> 00:04:51.854
and stay healthy

00:04:51.937 --> 00:04:53.772
until Mr. Lee returns.

00:04:54.607 --> 00:04:55.691
Do you understand?

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:00.112
But by the way

00:05:00.654 --> 00:05:02.072
did Han-young...

00:05:06.201 --> 00:05:07.745
really do that?

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:11.874
Of course not.

00:05:11.957 --> 00:05:13.208
He's just being accused.

00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:15.502
My goodness.

00:05:15.961 --> 00:05:17.171
My Han-young...

00:05:17.546 --> 00:05:18.881
Who did that?

00:05:19.214 --> 00:05:20.215
Who's the jerk

00:05:20.299 --> 00:05:22.176
accusing my Han-young of murder?

00:05:27.264 --> 00:05:28.265
"Father

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:29.850
and mother

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:32.311
I'll find the one who accused me

00:05:32.394 --> 00:05:33.771
prove my innocence

00:05:34.563 --> 00:05:36.231
and return proudly."

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.614
Had Mr. Lee been here

00:05:43.697 --> 00:05:47.493
he probably would've said that.

00:05:50.871 --> 00:05:52.039
Thank you.

00:05:52.122 --> 00:05:53.832
- Don't worry.
- Okay.

00:06:02.007 --> 00:06:03.676
That'll be 3,500 won.

00:06:15.521 --> 00:06:16.897
Don't tell me you believe

00:06:16.981 --> 00:06:18.399
what you hear on the news

00:06:18.816 --> 00:06:20.025
about Han-young.

00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:22.403
Who would believe that nonsense?

00:06:28.158 --> 00:06:29.618
Don't cry.

00:06:29.702 --> 00:06:31.954
Han-young can tell when you're crying.

00:06:32.705 --> 00:06:35.165
Focus on your studies all the more.

00:06:36.041 --> 00:06:37.042
And here.

00:06:37.126 --> 00:06:38.419
Don't forget your treats.

00:06:41.046 --> 00:06:42.047
Okay.

00:06:52.016 --> 00:06:54.393
CEO YU SEON-CHEOL

00:06:55.019 --> 00:06:56.895
You called me?

00:06:58.397 --> 00:07:01.150
Why didn't you just go home? You're drunk.

00:07:01.233 --> 00:07:02.359
You told me to come here.

00:07:29.553 --> 00:07:30.554
Go to a school abroad.

00:07:40.355 --> 00:07:42.649
You brought the evidence for Han-young.

00:07:42.733 --> 00:07:44.651
You might get involved
in an unnecessary mess.

00:08:09.718 --> 00:08:10.719
I...

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:14.515
didn't like living here, anyway.

00:08:23.524 --> 00:08:24.650
Don't tell me...

00:08:26.819 --> 00:08:28.570
I'll leave.

00:08:34.493 --> 00:08:36.870
I'll leave, okay?

00:08:47.422 --> 00:08:49.341
I'll go abroad to study.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.931
Sin-jin was

00:08:56.014 --> 00:08:57.432
always close by.

00:08:58.392 --> 00:09:02.563
After all, who hasn't gone to court
from political or business circles?

00:09:05.524 --> 00:09:08.777
Prosecutors and attorneys can talk
all they want

00:09:09.236 --> 00:09:10.320
but at the end of the day

00:09:10.529 --> 00:09:11.613
the judge gets the final say.

00:09:15.576 --> 00:09:16.702
Who is it this time?

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.121
Hmm?

00:09:28.964 --> 00:09:31.175
You were the first name he mentioned.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:37.973
Of course.

00:09:41.018 --> 00:09:43.145
I must've disappointed the old man
big time.

00:10:03.415 --> 00:10:04.917
You look like you're going to war.

00:10:06.084 --> 00:10:07.294
Hurry.

00:10:10.047 --> 00:10:11.131
From the Executive Branch

00:10:11.215 --> 00:10:13.258
to Hanyang's development
and National Pension investments

00:10:13.342 --> 00:10:15.219
Suojae had a grip on everything.

00:10:15.302 --> 00:10:17.471
What was going on in Suojae?

00:10:17.888 --> 00:10:18.889
So, it's...

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:20.682
Mr. Lee!

00:10:21.183 --> 00:10:22.726
How are you? Are you okay?

00:10:23.268 --> 00:10:24.269
Your neck.

00:10:24.478 --> 00:10:25.479
I'm fine.

00:10:26.021 --> 00:10:27.481
Yeah, that's not the focus.

00:10:27.564 --> 00:10:29.733
I'm being accused of murder!
Any questions about that?

00:10:29.816 --> 00:10:32.069
- Who'd believe that?
- I'd sooner believe in ghosts!

00:10:32.152 --> 00:10:33.237
You know, I spent the day

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.031
visiting your parents and Na-yeong
before coming here.

00:10:36.114 --> 00:10:37.449
I told everyone

00:10:37.532 --> 00:10:39.952
you were just being framed
and told them to relax.

00:10:40.035 --> 00:10:41.578
Don't disappoint me like that.

00:10:41.662 --> 00:10:42.704
Thank you.

00:10:43.622 --> 00:10:44.623
That's right.

00:10:44.706 --> 00:10:46.041
Sin-jin

00:10:46.124 --> 00:10:47.501
overthrew Suojae.

00:10:49.628 --> 00:10:50.837
First

00:10:50.921 --> 00:10:52.506
we need to clear your name.

00:10:53.298 --> 00:10:55.050
Someone definitely took your blood

00:10:55.133 --> 00:10:56.718
and smeared it on the corpse

00:10:56.802 --> 00:10:58.220
and all over the crime scene.

00:10:59.304 --> 00:11:01.598
Whoever did it,
Sin-jin must've made them do it.

00:11:02.266 --> 00:11:04.726
We have to find Sin-jin first, then.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:07.020
He has no family or relatives.

00:11:07.104 --> 00:11:08.522
Where could he be hiding?

00:11:09.439 --> 00:11:11.483
Find me before the police do.

00:11:12.192 --> 00:11:14.111
That's the least you can do

00:11:14.194 --> 00:11:15.696
to be cleared of the accusation.

00:11:18.031 --> 00:11:19.574
Sin-jin wants me

00:11:19.658 --> 00:11:21.285
to find him.

00:11:23.829 --> 00:11:25.455
Yes, Han Jeong-hun speaking.

00:11:27.374 --> 00:11:29.376
Not only will I hide Mr. Jang's record

00:11:29.459 --> 00:11:31.420
of illegal political funds
in the last election

00:11:33.046 --> 00:11:36.091
but I'll also bury any proof of his bribes
in the National Convention.

00:11:37.134 --> 00:11:38.135
Okay.

00:11:38.385 --> 00:11:39.469
I understand.

00:12:08.373 --> 00:12:09.958
Everyone is here.

00:12:10.042 --> 00:12:11.126
You can talk.

00:12:14.338 --> 00:12:17.007
All of you are
in the President’s hands and mine.

00:12:18.842 --> 00:12:22.387
I just sent you the files
of all your illegal deeds.

00:12:28.393 --> 00:12:30.979
But if you help me return

00:12:31.438 --> 00:12:33.899
the world will never see those files.

00:12:34.608 --> 00:12:35.734
Mr. President

00:12:36.068 --> 00:12:37.694
is confessing all our secrets

00:12:37.778 --> 00:12:38.862
to the prosecution.

00:12:45.994 --> 00:12:48.705
If Mr. President goes down,
he'll take the fall for it all.

00:12:49.289 --> 00:12:50.916
I'll make him.

00:13:11.353 --> 00:13:13.188
Nothing will change from before.

00:13:14.689 --> 00:13:16.441
I'll replace Mr. President

00:13:16.525 --> 00:13:18.026
and work with you all

00:13:19.403 --> 00:13:21.405
to lead our nation.

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:43.218
That's impressive for someone
who's on the run.

00:13:45.387 --> 00:13:47.889
Sin-jin knows
all the Suojae members' dirty secrets.

00:13:47.973 --> 00:13:48.974
He'll try to use them

00:13:49.057 --> 00:13:50.892
to go back to where he was.

00:13:50.976 --> 00:13:53.478
Sin-jin is a murderer. He killed Gyo-hun.

00:13:53.562 --> 00:13:54.855
Whether he accuses someone

00:13:54.938 --> 00:13:56.481
or kills more people to silence them

00:13:57.274 --> 00:13:59.067
he believes he can do anything he wants.

00:13:59.151 --> 00:14:00.277
That's Sin-jin for you.

00:14:01.403 --> 00:14:02.946
We can't let him have it his way.

00:14:03.363 --> 00:14:05.073
You came sooner than I expected.

00:14:05.157 --> 00:14:06.450
How have you been?

00:14:07.159 --> 00:14:08.160
Well

00:14:08.243 --> 00:14:09.494
it's not too bad.

00:14:17.377 --> 00:14:19.296
This has all the files
on the Suojae members.

00:14:19.379 --> 00:14:20.380
It contains

00:14:20.464 --> 00:14:22.215
their second phone numbers.

00:14:27.637 --> 00:14:29.556
But I've been very busy lately.

00:14:30.223 --> 00:14:31.933
With the serial cabbage theft

00:14:32.017 --> 00:14:33.685
and Kkamang, the breeding goat.

00:14:34.102 --> 00:14:35.604
Serial cabbage theft

00:14:35.687 --> 00:14:37.022
and Kkamang, the breeding goat?

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:38.231
You can add this

00:14:38.315 --> 00:14:40.609
to your list, then. It's nothing big.

00:14:43.153 --> 00:14:44.988
You realize this is the southernmost city?

00:14:45.614 --> 00:14:47.073
If I get pushed out any farther

00:14:47.157 --> 00:14:49.159
I might meet the Little Mermaid
and her family.

00:14:49.743 --> 00:14:51.244
There will be a feud in Suojae soon

00:14:51.328 --> 00:14:52.829
and they'll all be on their own.

00:14:53.622 --> 00:14:54.706
So, first

00:14:54.789 --> 00:14:57.876
let's start by tracking
the Suojae members' second phones.

00:14:59.044 --> 00:15:00.795
I have to track every single one, right?

00:15:00.879 --> 00:15:02.297
LIST OF SECOND PHONE NUMBERS
OF THE SUOJAE MEMBERS

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:03.465
Hey, Mr. Kim.

00:15:04.174 --> 00:15:06.635
You know the case of cabbage theft?

00:15:06.718 --> 00:15:07.886
I've done some research

00:15:07.969 --> 00:15:09.679
and it's a really big deal.

00:15:10.222 --> 00:15:13.266
We'll need to ask phone service providers
for location tracking.

00:15:13.642 --> 00:15:16.895
I put my job on the line
to track those phones.

00:15:31.493 --> 00:15:32.494
We need to find

00:15:32.577 --> 00:15:34.329
Nam-yong's flash drive that Sin-jin has.

00:15:34.829 --> 00:15:37.290
That's the only way
to wipe everyone out at once.

00:15:37.666 --> 00:15:39.417
Aren't we in trouble, even if we find it?

00:15:40.877 --> 00:15:42.712
Let's think about that after we find it.

00:15:55.267 --> 00:15:59.354
Should we side with Sin-jin or not?

00:15:59.437 --> 00:16:01.273
We probably should.

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:09.656
Won't the President-elect
try to strike us?

00:16:09.739 --> 00:16:12.033
He'll try to achieve something big
in the beginning.

00:16:12.117 --> 00:16:14.119
You say that

00:16:15.078 --> 00:16:17.414
as if the President-elect has never run
in elections.

00:16:17.497 --> 00:16:19.040
I'm sure

00:16:19.124 --> 00:16:21.376
Sin-jin, that snake, doesn't just have

00:16:21.459 --> 00:16:23.920
our lives at his fingertips.

00:16:24.004 --> 00:16:25.005
Oh!

00:16:25.088 --> 00:16:26.548
Illegal campaign funds.

00:16:42.772 --> 00:16:43.982
Did you request for support?

00:16:45.108 --> 00:16:47.193
Are you crazy? What, to get you arrested?

00:17:26.232 --> 00:17:28.026
Roll the window down and raise both hands.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.241
Hello.

00:17:40.038 --> 00:17:41.164
I'm on duty.

00:18:03.645 --> 00:18:04.646
Yes.

00:18:04.729 --> 00:18:06.481
That's a record
of politicians and law firms

00:18:06.564 --> 00:18:08.108
bribing judges in court.

00:18:11.611 --> 00:18:13.571
Han-young knows about the restaurant

00:18:13.655 --> 00:18:15.615
so the police may barge in anytime.

00:18:17.826 --> 00:18:18.910
Keep all of it safe

00:18:18.993 --> 00:18:20.578
until I return.

00:18:24.666 --> 00:18:25.667
Okay.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:26.835
Will do, Mr. Kang.

00:18:59.159 --> 00:19:00.410
That's impressive.

00:19:02.287 --> 00:19:05.123
I still have enough power to visit prison.

00:19:05.206 --> 00:19:06.207
So?

00:19:06.875 --> 00:19:08.918
I need your slush fund account.

00:19:09.002 --> 00:19:11.588
And what do I get in return?

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:14.424
I'll bring you back to Suojae.

00:19:17.552 --> 00:19:19.888
Didn't you try to kill me last time?

00:19:19.971 --> 00:19:21.306
Tables have turned.

00:19:27.312 --> 00:19:28.521
It's too late.

00:19:29.314 --> 00:19:32.108
I've already told
a little too much to the prosecution.

00:19:32.192 --> 00:19:33.777
Including things about you.

00:19:35.153 --> 00:19:36.488
Once I provide the proof

00:19:36.571 --> 00:19:37.947
all of you will get arrested.

00:19:39.949 --> 00:19:41.284
You still have a chance.

00:19:41.701 --> 00:19:43.787
Testimonies coerced by the prosecution

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:45.663
can be backtracked easily.

00:19:46.623 --> 00:19:47.624
No.

00:19:48.041 --> 00:19:49.626
The world has changed.

00:19:50.084 --> 00:19:53.546
I have all the files Nam-yong collected
from the Election Commission.

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.049
The record of illicit political funds
of assemblymen

00:19:56.132 --> 00:19:57.884
and the past and present Presidents

00:19:57.967 --> 00:19:59.469
that Nam-yong collected
in the National Election Commission.

00:20:00.178 --> 00:20:02.263
Of course, you're in it, too.

00:20:02.472 --> 00:20:03.765
I already know that.

00:20:13.483 --> 00:20:14.484
Of course.

00:20:15.735 --> 00:20:17.320
The new President-elect

00:20:17.403 --> 00:20:20.114
wore the badge in the last election.

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:21.825
I'm sure

00:20:21.908 --> 00:20:23.576
he didn't just use documented funds

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.620
to win in that election.

00:20:25.703 --> 00:20:28.331
If you snitch on the illegal funds
of the new President-elect

00:20:28.873 --> 00:20:31.543
he won't even have the power
to form a new Cabinet.

00:20:33.044 --> 00:20:35.672
They'll be eliminated at the hearing,
the Prime Minister included.

00:20:35.755 --> 00:20:38.716
A lame-duck government from the start...

00:20:42.637 --> 00:20:44.097
The new President-elect

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:45.473
wouldn't appreciate that.

00:20:52.564 --> 00:20:54.691
How about an account

00:20:55.108 --> 00:20:56.150
with 30 billion won?

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.339
At the end of the day,
only money and power persevere.

00:21:34.439 --> 00:21:35.523
He just got out.

00:21:37.317 --> 00:21:38.484
Okay.

00:21:40.361 --> 00:21:42.363
Get Se-hee out of the country fast.

00:21:57.754 --> 00:21:58.755
Thanks.

00:22:05.595 --> 00:22:06.596
Hey!

00:22:07.263 --> 00:22:09.057
Sin-jin just dropped by.

00:22:09.974 --> 00:22:12.560
He mentioned some files from Nam-yong.

00:22:12.936 --> 00:22:15.688
He has dirt
on the new President-elect, too.

00:22:16.439 --> 00:22:17.649
Sin-jin.

00:22:18.608 --> 00:22:20.401
Sin-jin is probably trying to return

00:22:20.485 --> 00:22:22.111
by blackmailing the President-elect.

00:22:22.195 --> 00:22:24.322
I know, but he offered

00:22:24.405 --> 00:22:26.407
to get me back in Suojae.

00:22:26.491 --> 00:22:28.159
I know he's lying, but I like the idea.

00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:30.495
So

00:22:30.828 --> 00:22:32.956
I gave him access to a hidden account

00:22:33.039 --> 00:22:36.250
that gets 10% of the monthly donations
from Seojin Happiness Foundation.

00:22:47.845 --> 00:22:49.055
What a disgusting laugh.

00:22:50.223 --> 00:22:51.724
They're all unbelievable.

00:22:53.351 --> 00:22:54.435
This is great.

00:22:55.228 --> 00:22:57.605
We can definitely arrest Sin-jin
with this.

00:23:00.274 --> 00:23:01.734
REPORTER SONG NA-YEON

00:23:02.485 --> 00:23:03.653
Yes, Ms. Song.

00:23:16.624 --> 00:23:18.584
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

00:23:21.087 --> 00:23:22.130
Hey, Mr. Park.

00:23:23.589 --> 00:23:26.634
I watched the news on your investigation
on Seonjin Happiness Foundation.

00:23:27.301 --> 00:23:28.386
Good work.

00:23:29.262 --> 00:23:30.805
Have you come to surrender?

00:23:31.889 --> 00:23:32.890
Turn myself in?

00:23:35.018 --> 00:23:37.020
No, I'm here
to clear up some misunderstandings.

00:23:37.478 --> 00:23:39.105
Oh, have you had lunch yet?

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.661
Do you admit to having murdered
Mr. Woo Gyo-hun?

00:23:59.876 --> 00:24:01.419
I told you. You got the wrong idea.

00:24:02.795 --> 00:24:05.506
You know Mr. Gwak Sun-won,
who died from gunshot wounds, right?

00:24:16.434 --> 00:24:17.435
Not sure.

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:43.711
Here.

00:24:47.006 --> 00:24:48.508
Goodness.

00:25:30.675 --> 00:25:32.093
CHIEF PROSECUTOR

00:25:41.102 --> 00:25:42.520
CHIEF PROSECUTOR

00:26:21.058 --> 00:26:23.603
The leader of the ruling party
and the Suojae members

00:26:23.686 --> 00:26:26.189
all testified that you killed Mr. Woo

00:26:26.272 --> 00:26:27.899
instead of Sin-jin.

00:26:28.649 --> 00:26:30.193
Sin-jin really might return to power

00:26:34.447 --> 00:26:36.157
at this rate.

00:26:38.784 --> 00:26:39.785
Don't worry.

00:26:40.661 --> 00:26:42.330
The tables will turn again.

00:26:49.503 --> 00:26:51.631
You bribed Mr. Kang
to be proven innocent, right?

00:26:52.965 --> 00:26:54.133
CHLORIDE

00:26:55.927 --> 00:26:57.428
He ran away.

00:26:57.511 --> 00:26:58.930
I didn't do anything.

00:26:59.847 --> 00:27:02.433
No, more like you couldn't do anything.

00:27:02.516 --> 00:27:03.684
That's an attempted murder.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:07.271
CHLORIDE

00:27:07.855 --> 00:27:09.106
How about we say

00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:12.109
you refused to collude with Sin-jin

00:27:13.194 --> 00:27:14.570
on his instigation of murder?

00:27:14.946 --> 00:27:15.947
Sorry?

00:27:19.992 --> 00:27:20.993
That's right.

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:22.495
I refused.

00:27:26.916 --> 00:27:29.210
The speech detailed
the new administration's plans

00:27:29.293 --> 00:27:32.296
to fulfill its promises
regarding the economy

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:33.965
made during its campaign.

00:27:34.507 --> 00:27:37.468
Mr. Kim said the economic recession....

00:27:37.551 --> 00:27:38.552
Breaking news.

00:27:38.636 --> 00:27:40.972
Kang Sin-jin, the former Chief Judge

00:27:41.055 --> 00:27:43.391
is a new target of investigation
on allegations of soliciting murder

00:27:43.474 --> 00:27:45.226
and forming a large illegal slush fund.

00:27:45.476 --> 00:27:47.270
Dr. A at the Mirae Medical Center

00:27:47.353 --> 00:27:49.230
testified to have been directed
by Mr. Kang

00:27:49.313 --> 00:27:51.482
to murder a patient in a coma.

00:27:51.899 --> 00:27:54.819
And before passing,
the late former President Park

00:27:55.236 --> 00:27:58.281
testified that Mr. Kang was the real owner
of the secret account

00:27:58.364 --> 00:28:00.783
that stole
from Seonjin Foundation's funds.

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:02.952
The investigative authorities found
Mr. Kang

00:28:03.035 --> 00:28:06.163
having collected funds
from politicians and businessmen

00:28:06.247 --> 00:28:07.540
over a very long period of time

00:28:07.623 --> 00:28:11.168
and having taken enormous bribes
to rule in favor of people in court.

00:28:33.607 --> 00:28:34.608
The Bible.

00:28:52.376 --> 00:28:53.878
Now that Gwang-to is dead

00:28:53.961 --> 00:28:57.006
Sin-jin is the only one
gripping on the Suojae members.

00:28:58.841 --> 00:29:00.718
Did you find anything in Gwang-to's cell?

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:02.720
I checked every corner of it

00:29:02.803 --> 00:29:04.930
and only found some personal items
and the Bible...

00:29:05.598 --> 00:29:06.682
The Bible?

00:29:08.601 --> 00:29:10.603
I'll get rid of Gwang-to,
the crazy shaman believer

00:29:10.686 --> 00:29:12.355
and become the leader of Suojae.

00:29:12.438 --> 00:29:13.481
When the day comes

00:29:14.565 --> 00:29:17.234
I'll need someone to establish
new justice with me.

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:18.944
Gwang-to is into shamanism.

00:29:19.028 --> 00:29:20.696
He wouldn't read the Bible.

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:22.698
Did you find anything odd in the Bible?

00:29:23.949 --> 00:29:25.910
Man, you scare me sometimes.

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:28.829
There was a talisman in the Bible.

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:38.381
Huh?

00:29:55.773 --> 00:29:58.150
DO NOT ENTER
POLICE LINE

00:29:58.734 --> 00:30:01.570
DO NOT ENTER
POLICE LINE

00:30:47.158 --> 00:30:48.868
TRANSACTION RECORDS OF POLITICAL FUNDS...

00:30:50.703 --> 00:30:53.164
This was the source of Gwang-to's power
over the Suojae members.

00:30:53.247 --> 00:30:54.832
Bust everyone mentioned here

00:30:54.915 --> 00:30:56.750
and Sin-jin will lose all his power.

00:30:57.918 --> 00:30:59.920
Looks like I'll be busy
with a big spring clean.

00:31:00.004 --> 00:31:01.547
Even once you're done busting Suojae

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:03.883
Sin-jin will still have
another card to play.

00:31:04.467 --> 00:31:05.468
Who is it?

00:31:05.718 --> 00:31:08.554
Kim Yoon-hyeok,
the judge at the Seoul Central Court.

00:31:09.013 --> 00:31:10.764
CASE INVOLVING JEONLIM CORPORATION

00:31:10.848 --> 00:31:12.808
DEPUTY CHIEF PROSECUTOR YOO WON-IK

00:31:14.643 --> 00:31:15.853
ORDER OF DISMISSAL
OF HANBIT BANK'S ARREST WARRANT

00:31:19.023 --> 00:31:20.441
Mr. Yoo.

00:31:31.827 --> 00:31:33.037
You'll need to come with us.

00:31:43.672 --> 00:31:44.673
Mr. Baek.

00:31:44.757 --> 00:31:45.758
Yes.

00:31:46.175 --> 00:31:47.176
Let's go.

00:31:50.804 --> 00:31:52.932
PARTY LEADER HAN JEONG-HUN

00:31:53.224 --> 00:31:54.475
Now isn't the time for this.

00:31:54.558 --> 00:31:56.602
Don't you realize what's going on?

00:31:57.019 --> 00:31:59.355
Let's start by deleting the files.

00:31:59.438 --> 00:32:00.564
Listen to me.

00:32:03.859 --> 00:32:06.028
We're the special investigation team
from Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office.

00:32:06.111 --> 00:32:07.446
You're all under an emergency arrest

00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:09.114
for allegations of abuse of power

00:32:09.198 --> 00:32:10.658
violation
of the National Information Security Act

00:32:10.741 --> 00:32:13.077
professional negligence,
receiving and offering bribes

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:15.996
and other charges.

00:32:20.125 --> 00:32:22.127
So, we meet again, Mr. Jang.

00:32:22.461 --> 00:32:25.297
CHAIRMAN JANG YONG-HYEON

00:32:26.757 --> 00:32:28.551
No need to worry about me anymore.

00:32:34.848 --> 00:32:37.518
CHAIRMAN JANG YONG-HYEON

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:10.134
Hey, Dad. I dropped Se-hee off.

00:33:10.217 --> 00:33:11.719
She should be on her flight by now.

00:33:13.679 --> 00:33:14.847
Thanks.

00:33:24.607 --> 00:33:26.984
The prosecution has put

00:33:27.067 --> 00:33:29.903
the Deputy Prosecutor General,
Jang Yong-hyeon, the Chairman of S Group

00:33:29.987 --> 00:33:31.947
Han Jeong-hun,
the Leader of the Daehan Central Party

00:33:32.031 --> 00:33:34.408
Lee Ju-chan, the head of Daejin Daily

00:33:34.491 --> 00:33:36.535
along with former and current politicians

00:33:36.619 --> 00:33:39.330
and business and media leaders
under emergency arrest.

00:33:39.413 --> 00:33:42.082
In the former President Park's flash drive

00:33:42.166 --> 00:33:44.460
the so-called "the Suojae X-file"

00:33:44.543 --> 00:33:45.836
the prosecution found

00:33:45.919 --> 00:33:48.589
numerous counts of crimes
committed by the Suojae members

00:33:48.672 --> 00:33:50.132
and the former Chief Judge Kang Sin-jin.

00:33:50.215 --> 00:33:52.426
Was the court, the last bastion of justice

00:33:52.509 --> 00:33:54.928
just a big hideout for criminals?

00:33:55.012 --> 00:33:56.930
Kang Sin-jin, the former Chief Judge

00:33:57.014 --> 00:33:58.557
under allegations of murder
and instigation of it

00:33:58.641 --> 00:34:00.100
was found taking bribes
from politicians and businessmen

00:34:00.184 --> 00:34:03.020
to play in their favor in court.

00:34:03.437 --> 00:34:07.149
But that's not the worst of it for us.

00:34:07.232 --> 00:34:09.568
Over 50 Presiding Judges were found

00:34:09.652 --> 00:34:13.113
colluding with the huge violation of law.

00:34:13.614 --> 00:34:16.659
This is absurd, to say the least.

00:34:16.742 --> 00:34:20.412
Korea's judicial system has
completely fallen.

00:34:24.083 --> 00:34:25.125
Come back.

00:34:27.628 --> 00:34:29.046
I'm a murder suspect.

00:34:29.129 --> 00:34:32.633
Your blood on the corpse
and the murder weapon is circumstantial.

00:34:32.716 --> 00:34:34.927
The Suojae guys will retract
their testimonies, too.

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:36.470
Don't make matters worse

00:34:36.553 --> 00:34:38.347
trying to get Sin-jin. Turn yourself in.

00:34:38.972 --> 00:34:40.808
I'll make sure
you can stay out of custody.

00:34:41.684 --> 00:34:43.852
But what if I really did murder Gyo-hun?

00:34:48.273 --> 00:34:50.818
Sin-jin only believed what he wanted to

00:34:51.318 --> 00:34:53.821
and assumed his decisions were
always right.

00:34:54.321 --> 00:34:56.949
And so, he managed to get
over 50 Presiding Judges

00:34:57.032 --> 00:34:58.367
to collude with him.

00:34:59.326 --> 00:35:01.453
The Judiciary does not hold
absolute justice.

00:35:01.537 --> 00:35:02.538
It only strives to.

00:35:03.872 --> 00:35:05.249
From that perspective

00:35:05.332 --> 00:35:07.000
Lee Han-young,
the murder suspect and judge

00:35:07.084 --> 00:35:09.294
shouldn't get to stay out of custody
for his investigation.

00:35:09.753 --> 00:35:10.754
For the law is

00:35:11.255 --> 00:35:12.840
equal to all.

00:35:16.927 --> 00:35:19.179
I'm glad I have a junior like you.

00:35:21.098 --> 00:35:22.099
Okay.

00:35:22.766 --> 00:35:24.685
I'm only human. I'm the same.

00:35:25.227 --> 00:35:28.230
I might even become like Sin-jin
before I realize it.

00:35:32.568 --> 00:35:34.987
Did you give the Suojae X-file
to the prosecution?

00:35:35.738 --> 00:35:36.739
Yes, sir.

00:35:37.865 --> 00:35:40.242
You could've gained a lot from it.

00:35:40.784 --> 00:35:42.327
Whether it be money or power

00:35:42.828 --> 00:35:45.497
you could've even built the next Suojae.

00:35:48.083 --> 00:35:50.294
I'll stick to reading case files

00:35:51.295 --> 00:35:52.504
sharpening my pencils

00:35:55.174 --> 00:35:56.592
and writing verdicts.

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:03.640
I'll bust Sin-jin and return to the court.

00:36:05.392 --> 00:36:06.393
Okay.

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:09.354
Come back and put Sin-jin to trial.

00:36:44.473 --> 00:36:47.142
Former President Park's "Suojae X-file"

00:36:47.226 --> 00:36:50.437
has turned into "the Kang Sin-jin Gate"
at an astounding pace.

00:36:50.521 --> 00:36:52.648
Questions are also arising

00:36:52.731 --> 00:36:55.359
regarding the former President's death.

00:36:55.442 --> 00:36:56.777
Some are claiming

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:59.238
that this may be another murder

00:36:59.321 --> 00:37:00.989
instigated by Kang

00:37:01.073 --> 00:37:02.658
and committed by his person.

00:37:14.586 --> 00:37:16.547
Han-young knows about the restaurant

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:18.590
so the police may barge in anytime.

00:37:19.675 --> 00:37:22.427
Keep all of it safe until I return.

00:37:25.138 --> 00:37:26.640
Return? In his dreams.

00:37:27.307 --> 00:37:28.725
I'm about to lose my job

00:37:29.351 --> 00:37:30.936
just because I took his orders.

00:37:31.478 --> 00:37:33.438
I don't want to take the fall for him.

00:37:37.985 --> 00:37:39.528
What should I do with these?

00:37:40.112 --> 00:37:41.738
Should I burn them all?

00:37:50.414 --> 00:37:51.623
Hold these for me for a sec.

00:37:52.416 --> 00:37:53.584
Look at these!

00:37:53.667 --> 00:37:55.335
These are some precious documents.

00:37:58.380 --> 00:37:59.756
You know how to put them on, right?

00:38:00.299 --> 00:38:01.675
Come on, Mr. Park.

00:38:02.217 --> 00:38:03.760
This is a little aggressive.

00:38:03.844 --> 00:38:05.095
You want me to do it?

00:38:05.178 --> 00:38:07.264
No, that's not what I mean...

00:38:11.059 --> 00:38:13.228
- Cheol-woo...
- It's all over.

00:38:20.777 --> 00:38:22.321
If I send this to the President-elect

00:38:22.404 --> 00:38:23.906
will he let me get away

00:38:23.989 --> 00:38:25.824
or be pardoned?

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:32.372
KIM YOON-HYEOK

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.209
You got rid of the files?

00:38:37.294 --> 00:38:38.545
Hey, it's Han-young.

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:41.465
I know you were desperate

00:38:41.548 --> 00:38:43.383
but Yoon-hyeok? Really?

00:38:44.176 --> 00:38:45.177
Oh.

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:47.387
Cheol-woo says thank you.

00:38:47.763 --> 00:38:49.681
For all the proof
of the bribes taken in court.

00:38:49.765 --> 00:38:50.933
You want to thank him?

00:38:51.224 --> 00:38:52.351
Thank you.

00:38:52.893 --> 00:38:55.187
I told you to find me
before the police did.

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:56.939
But you're just wasting time.

00:38:57.022 --> 00:38:58.023
Just wait.

00:38:58.482 --> 00:39:01.276
Once you lose everything you have
and are begging for your life

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.236
I'll be standing right before your eyes.

00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:05.113
But I wonder

00:39:05.572 --> 00:39:07.741
if you still have more cards to play.

00:39:10.911 --> 00:39:12.079
You don't think I do?

00:39:12.496 --> 00:39:14.831
What, you'll blackmail
the President-elect now?

00:39:16.917 --> 00:39:19.419
I walked out of the Prosecutors' Office
on my own

00:39:20.087 --> 00:39:22.089
and I'll return to my place soon.

00:39:23.757 --> 00:39:26.301
But you're still suspected
of killing Gyo-hun.

00:39:27.678 --> 00:39:29.179
Worry about yourself, not me.

00:39:36.645 --> 00:39:38.772
He told me to find him

00:39:38.855 --> 00:39:40.691
and now, he's going to return
to his place?

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:44.945
He's lying.

00:39:46.738 --> 00:39:47.864
That means...

00:39:48.657 --> 00:39:51.034
You made connections with smugglers
to catch Yong-jin.

00:39:52.035 --> 00:39:53.245
Yeah, why do you ask?

00:39:54.121 --> 00:39:55.247
Sin-jin might try

00:39:56.373 --> 00:39:58.000
to smuggle out of Korea.

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:04.047
Man, criminals always want to smuggle out.

00:40:05.465 --> 00:40:06.466
Alright.

00:40:12.556 --> 00:40:13.598
Witness?

00:40:14.433 --> 00:40:17.102
Ms. Yu came to see me.

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:19.855
Ms. Kim.

00:40:37.914 --> 00:40:41.626
She confessed to having stolen
some gauze with your blood on it.

00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:44.171
She used that

00:40:44.254 --> 00:40:45.547
to fabricate the murder evidence.

00:40:49.634 --> 00:40:51.970
Sin-jin must've made Seon-cheol do it

00:40:52.262 --> 00:40:53.472
who would've made

00:40:54.014 --> 00:40:55.390
Se-hee do it.

00:40:56.058 --> 00:40:57.350
So, Se-hee

00:40:58.435 --> 00:40:59.811
wouldn't have had a choice.

00:41:01.146 --> 00:41:02.189
Did you know about this?

00:41:06.151 --> 00:41:07.694
Is there something going on
between you two?

00:41:09.821 --> 00:41:11.364
We were married in our past lives.

00:41:11.948 --> 00:41:12.949
What?

00:41:14.242 --> 00:41:15.410
I'm kidding.

00:41:17.537 --> 00:41:19.122
What a ridiculous joke.

00:41:20.457 --> 00:41:21.708
Seriously, what's going on?

00:41:23.085 --> 00:41:24.252
MADAM CHOI
CAPTAIN SONG...

00:41:25.629 --> 00:41:28.006
MR. KIM, SMUGGLING PEOPLE

00:41:37.599 --> 00:41:39.059
Hey, Mr. Kim!

00:41:39.142 --> 00:41:40.435
It's me, Seok Jeong-ho.

00:41:40.519 --> 00:41:41.520
Yeah.

00:41:41.812 --> 00:41:43.188
How are you?

00:41:43.271 --> 00:41:44.272
Yeah.

00:41:44.397 --> 00:41:45.607
It's nothing big.

00:41:46.983 --> 00:41:48.485
Do you still take travelers

00:41:48.568 --> 00:41:50.153
on your night ships?

00:41:51.696 --> 00:41:53.698
No, it's not for me.

00:41:54.074 --> 00:41:58.620
SEONHWAGAK

00:42:27.858 --> 00:42:28.984
You okay?

00:42:32.696 --> 00:42:35.282
Didn't you ask the same question
when we first met?

00:42:37.492 --> 00:42:38.535
You were so young

00:42:39.703 --> 00:42:41.872
yet the most desperate beggar I'd seen.

00:42:43.248 --> 00:42:45.625
I gave you a fried dumpling
that'd already gone cold

00:42:46.084 --> 00:42:49.087
and you stuffed it in your face,
in fear that someone would take it.

00:42:52.966 --> 00:42:54.176
I've never had

00:42:56.511 --> 00:42:58.513
any food better than that dumpling.

00:43:06.479 --> 00:43:08.648
This is Mr. Cho's number.
He's based in Incheon.

00:43:09.774 --> 00:43:11.943
He'll do anything for money.

00:43:12.736 --> 00:43:14.070
He'll find you a ship.

00:43:36.092 --> 00:43:37.093
See you again.

00:43:38.345 --> 00:43:39.721
You'd better keep that promise.

00:43:39.804 --> 00:43:40.805
Okay?

00:43:51.858 --> 00:43:56.613
SEONHWAGAK

00:44:03.662 --> 00:44:05.247
I got a call from a smuggling broker.

00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:07.415
He's based in Incheon.
I think Sin-jin called him.

00:44:07.499 --> 00:44:08.625
Check the address I sent you.

00:44:08.708 --> 00:44:10.126
STONE JEONG-HO

00:44:11.127 --> 00:44:12.128
I got it.

00:44:12.212 --> 00:44:14.756
I texted the address
to Cheol-woo and Jin-a as well.

00:44:14.839 --> 00:44:15.966
I'll get on my way now.

00:44:16.716 --> 00:44:17.717
Okay.

00:44:41.199 --> 00:44:42.742
WANMYEONG-DAERO, SEO-GU

00:45:01.386 --> 00:45:02.387
Oh, hi!

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:03.680
Welcome, sir.

00:45:09.269 --> 00:45:10.312
When's the ship leaving?

00:45:12.063 --> 00:45:13.898
In two to three hours.

00:45:23.283 --> 00:45:25.035
I'll pay you the rest once I arrive.

00:45:29.581 --> 00:45:30.790
Sure, we can do that.

00:45:31.499 --> 00:45:32.500
What are you doing?

00:45:32.584 --> 00:45:34.544
Get a drink for the guest or something!

00:45:43.011 --> 00:45:45.013
You know

00:45:45.096 --> 00:45:46.389
life is so exhausting.

00:45:46.973 --> 00:45:48.183
Here.

00:45:51.353 --> 00:45:53.271
Come on. Don't make me feel awkward.

00:45:56.316 --> 00:45:57.984
You get awkward about nothing, huh?

00:46:08.661 --> 00:46:09.662
Get him!

00:46:53.164 --> 00:46:54.290
Sir!

00:46:58.336 --> 00:46:59.796
You mind if I check your bag?

00:47:01.756 --> 00:47:03.591
Are you carrying a gold bar or something?

00:47:04.384 --> 00:47:05.385
Bring it.

00:47:13.935 --> 00:47:15.061
What are you doing here?

00:47:15.979 --> 00:47:17.272
And what are you doing here?

00:47:17.856 --> 00:47:19.941
Shouldn't you be glad to see me?

00:47:21.484 --> 00:47:23.528
Why didn't you bring your big friend?

00:47:23.611 --> 00:47:25.029
That would've been cowardly.

00:47:25.488 --> 00:47:26.865
You guys are ridiculous.

00:47:27.949 --> 00:47:30.160
Do you always need the boss
to give you an order?

00:47:30.243 --> 00:47:31.536
Get on it!

00:47:31.619 --> 00:47:32.704
Get them!

00:47:49.471 --> 00:47:51.389
Should've found a proper broker
for smuggling.

00:47:51.473 --> 00:47:52.474
Yeah.

00:47:53.224 --> 00:47:54.642
I didn't know. I'm new to this.

00:47:59.272 --> 00:48:00.398
When we get out of here

00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:03.067
I promise to free you
of your murder accusation.

00:48:04.402 --> 00:48:05.904
I already got that sorted.

00:48:07.906 --> 00:48:09.240
Why are you here, then?

00:48:09.324 --> 00:48:10.783
To bring you to court.

00:48:14.454 --> 00:48:15.705
You think getting rid of me

00:48:16.372 --> 00:48:18.124
will bring your justice to the world?

00:48:19.626 --> 00:48:20.627
No, I'll prove

00:48:21.294 --> 00:48:23.087
that the justice I've chosen is right.

00:48:50.865 --> 00:48:51.866
You alright?

00:49:16.391 --> 00:49:17.559
Who the hell are you guys?

00:49:22.772 --> 00:49:23.773
Wrap it up.

00:49:24.524 --> 00:49:25.650
Han-young!

00:49:26.025 --> 00:49:27.026
What?

00:49:38.788 --> 00:49:39.789
Freeze!

00:49:41.791 --> 00:49:42.792
Freeze!

00:49:53.261 --> 00:49:54.804
Come with me. Reap what you've sown.

00:49:57.432 --> 00:49:59.142
You think this is the end of it?

00:49:59.225 --> 00:50:00.518
There's no end.

00:50:00.893 --> 00:50:02.770
It's a world full of criminals.

00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:15.366
Mr. Yu Seon-cheol.

00:50:19.912 --> 00:50:21.998
You're under emergency arrest
on charges of fabricating evidence

00:50:22.081 --> 00:50:23.374
witness tampering

00:50:23.458 --> 00:50:24.876
and illicit judicial compromise.

00:50:33.343 --> 00:50:34.552
Dad!

00:50:35.595 --> 00:50:36.596
Who the hell are you?

00:50:36.679 --> 00:50:37.930
Do you know where this is?

00:50:38.014 --> 00:50:39.182
Mr. Yu Jin-gwang.

00:50:47.774 --> 00:50:48.941
This is an arrest warrant for you.

00:50:51.903 --> 00:50:52.904
Let's go.

00:50:53.237 --> 00:50:54.489
Ms. Yu Ha-na as well.

00:50:54.572 --> 00:50:57.075
The investigators are waiting for you two

00:50:57.158 --> 00:50:58.826
for tax evasion and witness tampering.

00:51:04.499 --> 00:51:05.958

HAENAL LAW FIRM

00:51:20.181 --> 00:51:23.601
The trial for Kang Sin-jin,
the former Chief Judge

00:51:23.685 --> 00:51:24.894
will proceed tomorrow.

00:51:25.019 --> 00:51:27.397
All legal, political, and business leaders

00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:30.692
are paying close attention
to the court's decision.

00:51:31.275 --> 00:51:34.821
The prosecution is expected
to request the court

00:51:34.904 --> 00:51:38.116
to sentence Kang to a life sentence.

00:51:38.199 --> 00:51:40.576
Mr. Lee Han-young,
the judge for the first trial

00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:42.995
accepted Defendant Kang Sin-jin's request

00:51:43.079 --> 00:51:45.123
to broadcast the trial.

00:51:51.629 --> 00:51:53.172
How much time

00:51:53.256 --> 00:51:55.049
will I get here?

00:52:08.229 --> 00:52:09.522
Will I continue

00:52:09.605 --> 00:52:11.149
to make new choices

00:52:11.232 --> 00:52:13.651
and live with their consequences?

00:52:36.174 --> 00:52:37.425
Is this

00:52:37.508 --> 00:52:41.053
the end of the suspension
of Defendant Lee Han-young's sentence?

00:53:18.674 --> 00:53:20.218
Please rise, everyone.

00:53:31.854 --> 00:53:33.231
COURT

00:53:33.314 --> 00:53:34.899
Everyone may be seated.

00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:40.655
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

00:53:40.738 --> 00:53:46.911
DEFENDANT

00:53:46.994 --> 00:53:50.623
JUDGE

00:53:50.706 --> 00:53:51.916
We will now begin

00:53:51.999 --> 00:53:54.293
the final hearing

00:53:55.127 --> 00:53:58.089
of Defendant Kang Sin-jin's case,
Number 2025GH1562.

00:53:58.631 --> 00:53:59.715
As requested

00:54:00.925 --> 00:54:02.343
by the Defendant

00:54:02.426 --> 00:54:04.178
the court will broadcast the trial.

00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:07.223
At last.

00:54:07.306 --> 00:54:10.226
The final hearing date for Sin-jin.

00:54:10.643 --> 00:54:11.936
CHIEF JUSTICE BAEK YI-SEOK

00:54:12.019 --> 00:54:13.646
Defendant Kang Sin-jin

00:54:13.729 --> 00:54:15.731
took someone's life

00:54:16.315 --> 00:54:18.401
and instigated five murders.

00:54:26.033 --> 00:54:27.952
He used his power and authority

00:54:28.035 --> 00:54:31.706
to commit atrocious crimes,
violating laws of humanity.

00:54:32.957 --> 00:54:35.293
The Defendant had a duty
to protect law enforcement

00:54:36.002 --> 00:54:39.046
turned this sacred temple of law
into his personal killing floor.

00:54:39.797 --> 00:54:42.049
He also used his wealth and power
to bribe judges

00:54:42.133 --> 00:54:43.885
and threatened witnesses

00:54:43.968 --> 00:54:45.720
to coerce them into false testimonies.

00:54:48.764 --> 00:54:50.600
He destroyed evidence

00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:53.269
to hide the truth.

00:55:01.569 --> 00:55:02.945
Your Honor

00:55:03.362 --> 00:55:06.282
therefore, the prosecution requests
the court consider

00:55:07.366 --> 00:55:10.453
the Defendant's violation of Article 250
on Murder, Killing Ascendant

00:55:10.995 --> 00:55:13.497
Article 31 on Instigator

00:55:13.998 --> 00:55:16.709
Article 129 on Acceptance of Bribe
and Advance Acceptance

00:55:16.792 --> 00:55:20.212
Article 123 on Abuse of Authority

00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:23.424
Article 152 on Perjury, Malicious Perjury

00:55:25.051 --> 00:55:26.135
and

00:55:26.802 --> 00:55:30.389
Article 155 on Destruction of Evidence
and Special Exception to Relatives

00:55:30.806 --> 00:55:32.850
all of which are serious crimes

00:55:36.604 --> 00:55:38.564
and sentence him to capital punishment.

00:55:59.794 --> 00:56:03.506
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

00:56:04.131 --> 00:56:05.967
Defendant Kang Sin-jin.

00:56:22.525 --> 00:56:23.859
JUDGE

00:56:35.788 --> 00:56:37.331
JUDGE

00:56:48.092 --> 00:56:50.302
Where is justice in Korea?

00:56:55.599 --> 00:56:57.226
The prosecution fabricates evidence

00:56:57.309 --> 00:56:59.353
to turn victims into perpetrators

00:57:01.856 --> 00:57:05.359
judges use legal codes to trivialize
the gravity of the crime

00:57:07.945 --> 00:57:11.198
and the press pursues profit over truth.

00:57:12.324 --> 00:57:13.576
I...

00:57:18.581 --> 00:57:20.750
climbed down into the mud

00:57:20.833 --> 00:57:24.128
and got my own hands dirty.

00:57:24.211 --> 00:57:27.006
To save my nation
that's been swallowed by corruption

00:57:27.089 --> 00:57:29.216
and its justice system rotted to the core!

00:57:31.927 --> 00:57:34.263
I sacrificed myself for the change.

00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:45.649
If that fool of a judge
hadn't gotten in my way

00:57:47.735 --> 00:57:49.487
my sacrifice

00:57:51.572 --> 00:57:52.990
could've brought

00:57:53.908 --> 00:57:56.118
a beautiful renaissance
to justice in Korea.

00:58:08.672 --> 00:58:10.257
Plagues and famines.

00:58:15.638 --> 00:58:17.348
Mr. Kang

00:58:17.431 --> 00:58:18.808
your renaissance would've been

00:58:20.101 --> 00:58:22.770
full of nothing but plagues and famines.

00:58:22.853 --> 00:58:25.606
It wouldn't have been glorious at all.

00:58:27.358 --> 00:58:28.400
You were the same.

00:58:29.193 --> 00:58:30.694
You fabricated evidence

00:58:30.778 --> 00:58:31.904
murdered witnesses

00:58:32.446 --> 00:58:33.948
and took bribes in court

00:58:34.031 --> 00:58:36.242
to define who was guilty and who wasn't.

00:58:39.495 --> 00:58:41.997
Those were just sacrifices
to achieve greater justice.

00:58:42.414 --> 00:58:43.874
Sacrifices that had to be made.

00:58:44.959 --> 00:58:46.669
And who agreed to that?

00:58:50.506 --> 00:58:51.507
Nobody

00:58:52.383 --> 00:58:54.009
agreed with you.

00:59:01.225 --> 00:59:02.309
No.

00:59:04.061 --> 00:59:06.313
There's no definition of justice
everyone will agree on.

00:59:07.106 --> 00:59:09.275
Justice without sacrifices never improves.

00:59:09.942 --> 00:59:11.443
Meanwhile

00:59:12.111 --> 00:59:13.445
evilness will barge in

00:59:13.529 --> 00:59:15.156
and quickly take over the world.

00:59:16.407 --> 00:59:18.033
Lee Han-young!

00:59:26.709 --> 00:59:28.961
So, your definition of justice is evil.

00:59:30.087 --> 00:59:33.132
We need new justice to change the world.

00:59:37.178 --> 00:59:38.596
To scrap collectors

00:59:38.679 --> 00:59:40.806
justice weighs a kilogram of scraps.

00:59:41.140 --> 00:59:42.349
To 12th graders

00:59:42.808 --> 00:59:45.144
their grades and university acceptances.

00:59:46.145 --> 00:59:47.313
Therefore

00:59:47.396 --> 00:59:49.106
justice cannot belong to one individual.

00:59:49.815 --> 00:59:51.442
It must belong to all of us.

00:59:51.525 --> 00:59:54.528
That kind of justice is too slow!
It's evil!

00:59:55.821 --> 00:59:56.864
No.

00:59:56.947 --> 00:59:59.033
Justice is not a race.
It's a moral compass.

00:59:59.366 --> 01:00:02.745
An individual's idea of justice
cannot change the world.

01:00:02.828 --> 01:00:05.789
The only people who believed
they were the only ones to save the world

01:00:17.801 --> 01:00:18.886
were dictators.

01:00:18.969 --> 01:00:20.012
No!

01:00:34.318 --> 01:00:35.736
Justice isn't anything special.

01:00:37.196 --> 01:00:38.197
Therefore

01:00:38.864 --> 01:00:41.575
as an ordinary human
who feels like everyone else

01:00:42.201 --> 01:00:43.702
I am ready to announce

01:00:45.329 --> 01:00:46.538
Defendant Kang Sin-jin's verdict.

01:00:55.547 --> 01:00:56.924
The court is now ready!

01:00:57.758 --> 01:01:00.135
My only crimes are having trusted you...

01:01:01.011 --> 01:01:02.930
The court orders Defendant Kang Sin-jin...

01:01:03.013 --> 01:01:04.723
and letting you get in my way

01:01:05.099 --> 01:01:07.393
of establishing new justice!

01:01:21.615 --> 01:01:22.700
...to death.

01:01:22.783 --> 01:01:24.159
Han-young!

01:01:34.378 --> 01:01:35.379
Justice is

01:01:35.879 --> 01:01:37.089
nothing special.

01:01:58.277 --> 01:02:00.154
So, you never found the flash drive

01:02:00.237 --> 01:02:01.697
Nam-yong gave Sin-jin?

01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:03.782
Sin-jin refused to turn it in
until the end.

01:02:04.450 --> 01:02:07.828
He's still clinging to his wicked dream,
even after all this.

01:02:08.245 --> 01:02:09.246
How foolish.

01:02:09.330 --> 01:02:11.707
I guess
the prosecution didn't need it that badly.

01:02:11.790 --> 01:02:13.083
Probably not.

01:02:13.167 --> 01:02:14.168
Oh, by the way

01:02:14.376 --> 01:02:16.462
I've decided not to join Haenal.

01:02:17.838 --> 01:02:19.798
Did Se-hee call you?

01:02:19.882 --> 01:02:21.300
Basically.

01:02:21.675 --> 01:02:24.762
I was told they'd be canceling
my contract as their legal advisor.

01:02:25.554 --> 01:02:26.764
With Mr. Yu Seon-cheol

01:02:26.847 --> 01:02:29.725
Mr. Yu Jin-gwang, and Ms. Yu Ha-na
all arrested

01:02:29.808 --> 01:02:32.061
I guess Se-hee couldn't handle the firm
on her own.

01:02:33.145 --> 01:02:36.315
She seems to have left Haenal
in the hands of the lead counsel.

01:02:37.608 --> 01:02:39.985
So, you don't keep in touch with her?

01:02:41.737 --> 01:02:42.738
No.

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:50.079
Did he move on to someone new already?

01:02:50.746 --> 01:02:52.289
He said she was a colleague.

01:02:52.373 --> 01:02:53.374
Come on.

01:02:54.249 --> 01:02:56.752
How can a judge be colleagues
with a prosecutor?

01:02:56.835 --> 01:02:58.295
Have you never been to the court?

01:02:58.379 --> 01:02:59.963
They all work in the legal field.

01:03:00.047 --> 01:03:01.340
They're all the same.

01:03:02.424 --> 01:03:03.550
Really?

01:03:08.514 --> 01:03:09.890
But you know

01:03:09.973 --> 01:03:11.725
she kind of seems familiar.

01:03:11.809 --> 01:03:13.060
Where have I seen her?

01:03:13.143 --> 01:03:14.144
Come on.

01:03:14.561 --> 01:03:17.272
Where could you have possibly seen her?

01:03:18.065 --> 01:03:19.566
- You're hilarious.
- I guess not.

01:03:21.985 --> 01:03:23.946
Those are some loud whispers, huh?

01:03:26.782 --> 01:03:28.117
My parents once told me

01:03:29.576 --> 01:03:31.203
about you.

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:36.333
They said a teenager visited them,
asking them to forgive her dad.

01:03:37.334 --> 01:03:40.003
And that they felt terrible
for not inviting her to a meal.

01:03:43.715 --> 01:03:45.050
Enjoy.

01:03:50.139 --> 01:03:52.933
I still haven't apologized properly

01:03:54.143 --> 01:03:55.644
and owe them so much.

01:03:57.896 --> 01:03:59.690
You're paying back by enjoying this meal.

01:03:59.773 --> 01:04:00.983
You're paying them back now.

01:04:05.821 --> 01:04:06.822
Okay.

01:04:07.406 --> 01:04:09.366
The food is extra good today.

01:04:10.784 --> 01:04:12.369
Do the dishes suit your taste?

01:04:12.453 --> 01:04:13.954
Yes, they're delicious.

01:04:14.037 --> 01:04:15.247
Have more.

01:04:15.330 --> 01:04:16.748
- We have a lot more.
- Thank you.

01:04:24.506 --> 01:04:26.467
Back then, I was too young

01:04:26.550 --> 01:04:28.177
that I ran away

01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:30.137
without a proper apology.

01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:31.263
I'm sorry.

01:04:33.056 --> 01:04:36.351
I hope your father recovers.

01:04:37.853 --> 01:04:39.605
He's come a long way.

01:04:39.688 --> 01:04:40.689
He's much better.

01:04:41.064 --> 01:04:42.357
Glad to hear that.

01:04:42.983 --> 01:04:45.068
What a wonderful person you've become.

01:04:47.362 --> 01:04:49.198
- Thank you.
- She's beautiful, too.

01:04:52.284 --> 01:04:53.619
Have some apple slices.

01:04:53.702 --> 01:04:54.703
Okay.

01:05:01.543 --> 01:05:04.963
THE FIRST FINAL LEET MOCK EXAM

01:06:13.782 --> 01:06:17.119
I didn't think
she'd actually apply for law school.

01:06:46.231 --> 01:06:48.400
JUDGE

01:06:48.984 --> 01:06:50.694
Defendant Jang Su-gyeong

01:06:50.777 --> 01:06:52.487
has served her sentence through life

01:06:53.155 --> 01:06:55.449
for what happened to Suni.

01:06:57.284 --> 01:07:00.454
This was proven
by Reporter Song's interview

01:07:00.537 --> 01:07:01.955
of the local merchants

01:07:02.581 --> 01:07:04.166
and Mr. Seok Jeong-ho...

01:07:04.249 --> 01:07:05.250
WITNESS

01:07:05.334 --> 01:07:08.587
who grew up at the market.

01:07:11.298 --> 01:07:12.841
JUDGE

01:07:12.924 --> 01:07:13.967
I hereby order

01:07:18.513 --> 01:07:20.015
Defendant Jang Su-gyeong

01:07:21.308 --> 01:07:22.976
to continue living the way she has been

01:07:24.186 --> 01:07:27.105
as an earnest and kind neighbor,
sharing love with her neighbors

01:07:30.651 --> 01:07:32.444
and living to the fullest

01:07:36.239 --> 01:07:38.492
with memories of Suni

01:07:42.245 --> 01:07:44.247
for all the years

01:07:45.123 --> 01:07:46.333
Suni didn't get to live.

01:08:03.308 --> 01:08:05.185
Su-gyeong got married

01:08:05.852 --> 01:08:07.938
and had her first child after a year,
named Suni.

01:08:09.064 --> 01:08:10.524
One busy day of endless customers

01:08:10.607 --> 01:08:12.567
she had no time to check on Suni

01:08:15.862 --> 01:08:16.905
and the poor baby had

01:08:18.824 --> 01:08:20.242
a blanket suffocating her.

01:08:25.247 --> 01:08:26.915
Since then, whoever she met

01:08:26.998 --> 01:08:28.834
she referred to her family,
"Suni's family."

01:08:31.628 --> 01:08:34.256
Because she felt so bad for Suni,
who didn't even live a year.

01:08:35.924 --> 01:08:37.926
And for the guilt
of not having served jail time

01:08:39.970 --> 01:08:43.432
which made her feel even more guilt.

01:08:44.224 --> 01:08:45.267
So, she made a vow

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:50.397
to live with guilt
for the rest of her life.

01:09:03.618 --> 01:09:05.579
Can you rent an office

01:09:05.662 --> 01:09:07.664
to a reporter of principles

01:09:08.373 --> 01:09:10.375
who's a little poor?

01:09:12.711 --> 01:09:13.712
Sorry?

01:09:15.172 --> 01:09:17.174
I quit my job at Daejin Daily.

01:09:17.257 --> 01:09:18.967
I'm going to run a solo news agency.

01:09:19.050 --> 01:09:20.385
"Song Na-yeon TV."

01:09:22.429 --> 01:09:23.805
- You want to join me?
- Yes!

01:09:25.015 --> 01:09:26.141
That soon?

01:09:26.224 --> 01:09:27.517
I'll do anything with you.

01:09:27.601 --> 01:09:30.103
Really? How should we split the profits?

01:09:51.541 --> 01:09:52.751
I heard you liked these.

01:10:13.438 --> 01:10:14.731
What happened to Seonhwagak's owner?

01:10:16.483 --> 01:10:18.109
They have great jjajangmyeon.

01:10:19.569 --> 01:10:21.822
The chef is the owner.
They can't get rid of the chef.

01:10:46.263 --> 01:10:51.393
SUOJAE

01:11:59.127 --> 01:12:05.091
WHERE HOPE AND TOMORROW WAITS

01:12:26.363 --> 01:12:29.950
CORRECTIONAL FACILITY

01:12:35.038 --> 01:12:36.831
Is everything over now?

01:12:40.126 --> 01:12:41.586
Does this mean

01:12:42.379 --> 01:12:43.964
it's all over now?

01:12:48.426 --> 01:12:49.886
Or

01:12:51.596 --> 01:12:53.473
do I have to keep living this life

01:12:53.932 --> 01:12:57.352
to serve my time
for what I'd done in my past life?

01:13:00.105 --> 01:13:01.356
Sure.

01:13:02.524 --> 01:13:03.942
Whatever is coming in my way

01:13:04.484 --> 01:13:06.194
will I continue to choose

01:13:07.529 --> 01:13:10.073
justice over everything?

01:13:17.747 --> 01:13:19.708
Here's your order of meat!

01:13:19.791 --> 01:13:21.209
The food is amazing!

01:13:21.710 --> 01:13:22.919
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE EXPANSION!

01:13:24.379 --> 01:13:25.422
JEONGYUK RESTAURANT

01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:28.425
Everyone!

01:13:29.592 --> 01:13:30.844
Han-young!

01:13:32.762 --> 01:13:33.972
Hi!

01:13:34.848 --> 01:13:36.307
Welcome to our restaurant!

01:13:36.391 --> 01:13:37.726
One soup for Han-young, Auntie!

01:13:38.018 --> 01:13:39.227
- Come and eat.
- Is it good?

01:13:39.310 --> 01:13:40.520
We'll take some sundae and pyeonyuk, too.

01:13:48.778 --> 01:13:54.200
NEW OPENING OF SUNI'S RESTAURANT

01:13:54.325 --> 01:13:58.204
THE JUDGE RETURNS

01:15:44.519 --> 01:15:46.521
