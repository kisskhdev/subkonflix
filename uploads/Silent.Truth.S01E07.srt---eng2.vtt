WEBVTT

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:08.012
{\an8}Your son shoplifted from my store.

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:10.448
{\an8}We shouldn't let him manipulate us
any further.

00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:11.983
{\an8}What is he demanding?

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.752
{\an8}The victim is Hideyuki Sakuma,
40 years old.

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:16.454
{\an8}The bullet extracted from the body

00:00:16.521 --> 00:00:20.358
{\an8}was fired from the gun
that belonged to Keisuke's father.

00:00:20.425 --> 00:00:21.493
{\an8}I did it.

00:00:23.561 --> 00:00:24.829
{\an8}What about the gun?

00:00:24.896 --> 00:00:26.865
{\an8}I haven’t mentioned the time capsule.

00:00:26.931 --> 00:00:28.133
{\an8}The gun will most likely

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.367
{\an8}never appear ever again.

00:00:29.434 --> 00:00:31.469
{\an8}The police asked me
when I was at the salon…

00:00:31.536 --> 00:00:33.104
{\an8}When was the last time you used it?

00:00:33.171 --> 00:00:35.406
{\an8}Saturday, the 17th.

00:00:35.473 --> 00:00:37.041
{\an8}I have something I'd like to ask you.

00:00:37.108 --> 00:00:39.043
{\an8}Would you mind coming
to the police station?

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.111
{\an8}I decline.

00:00:40.178 --> 00:00:43.014
{\an8}Junichi, why did you become
a police officer?

00:00:43.081 --> 00:00:44.816
{\an8}I shouldn't have become one.

00:00:44.883 --> 00:00:46.251
{\an8}Thank you for coming.

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:49.954
{\an8}Let's all go find the gun.

00:00:50.021 --> 00:00:51.923
{\an8}I asked you all to gather here

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.261
{\an8}because I want to re-examine the incident
that happened 23 years ago.

00:00:56.327 --> 00:00:57.896
{\an8}When Officer Kiyohara was shot,

00:00:57.962 --> 00:01:01.132
{\an8}he dropped the gun he was holding.

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.702
{\an8}The person who picked it up shot Oshima.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.704
{\an8}Who shot Oshima?

00:01:07.272 --> 00:01:09.807
{\an8}The first person to arrive
at this location.

00:01:12.677 --> 00:01:13.845
{\an8}You shouldn't be

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.048
{\an8}with someone like me!

00:01:27.225 --> 00:01:28.726
I shot him.

00:01:42.907 --> 00:01:44.475
The person who killed Oshima…

00:01:46.644 --> 00:01:47.745
was me.

00:01:53.051 --> 00:01:54.619
When I got here,

00:01:55.853 --> 00:01:58.223
and saw the gunned down Officer Kiyohara,

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:59.524
I spotted…

00:02:03.895 --> 00:02:05.930
Oshima standing there.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.235
Our eyes met,

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:12.537
so I got scared

00:02:15.173 --> 00:02:16.541
and tried to run away,

00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:18.810
but I tripped and fell…

00:02:22.213 --> 00:02:24.449
That’s when I felt Officer Kiyohara's gun.

00:02:25.283 --> 00:02:26.317
So I…

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:32.523
took it…

00:02:37.095 --> 00:02:38.196
I picked it up…

00:02:43.334 --> 00:02:44.469
I picked it up

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.972
and aimed it at Oshima.

00:02:53.411 --> 00:02:55.546
My mind went blank.

00:02:56.881 --> 00:02:57.715
And then?

00:02:58.516 --> 00:02:59.617
The gun?

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.922
I left it here and returned to Naoto.

00:03:06.758 --> 00:03:09.727
Mr. Kiyohara and Ms. Iwamoto
were with Mr. Sakuma,

00:03:10.495 --> 00:03:12.263
so the four of you came here together?

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:18.369
I am just as guilty as Junichi.

00:03:19.203 --> 00:03:20.505
What do you mean?

00:03:20.571 --> 00:03:22.307
When Junichi first came here,

00:03:23.975 --> 00:03:26.210
I had actually followed him here too.

00:03:29.147 --> 00:03:30.415
From around that area,

00:03:31.516 --> 00:03:34.452
I saw Junichi holding a gun.

00:03:36.554 --> 00:03:37.855
Then I heard a gunshot…

00:03:39.457 --> 00:03:42.493
and I panicked
and ran away from the scene.

00:03:44.262 --> 00:03:45.897
All this time, I kept quiet

00:03:47.332 --> 00:03:49.734
about Junichi shooting Oshima.

00:03:51.202 --> 00:03:54.072
So I’m just as guilty as Junichi.

00:03:54.138 --> 00:03:55.340
So,

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.943
when the four of you arrived here,

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.680
the gun was still lying near the body.

00:04:03.514 --> 00:04:05.383
Is that correct?

00:04:08.252 --> 00:04:09.120
However,

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.022
during the investigation conducted

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:13.257
immediately after
the four of you were rescued,

00:04:13.324 --> 00:04:15.760
no gun was found.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.965
What happened to the gun?

00:04:23.034 --> 00:04:23.968
Are you

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:28.406
suggesting that one of us took it?

00:04:28.473 --> 00:04:30.074
Yes, that's a possibility.

00:04:30.141 --> 00:04:31.008
But

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:35.046
my brother said he found the gun
in the forest.

00:04:52.497 --> 00:04:53.698
I understand.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.601
Everyone,

00:04:57.168 --> 00:05:00.004
thank you all for your cooperation.

00:05:03.207 --> 00:05:06.744
Please don't tell anyone
about what we just discussed here.

00:05:08.813 --> 00:05:11.716
Everything, including Detective Tobina's
shooting of Oshima,

00:05:12.383 --> 00:05:13.584
needs to stay

00:05:14.685 --> 00:05:16.888
strictly confidential, just between us.

00:05:19.624 --> 00:05:20.892
Understood.

00:05:22.627 --> 00:05:23.628
Okay.

00:05:24.195 --> 00:05:25.129
Okay.

00:05:58.796 --> 00:05:59.964
We'll be going now.

00:06:00.465 --> 00:06:03.801
Thank you Mr. Kiyohara and Ms. Iwamoto.

00:06:16.781 --> 00:06:17.915
See you again.

00:06:54.018 --> 00:06:56.821
Junichi shot Oshima in the back.

00:06:58.823 --> 00:07:02.460
If he shot Oshima
as he was trying to escape,

00:07:04.095 --> 00:07:06.364
it must have been to avenge my dad.

00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:16.340
For 23 years, he kept it to himself,
without telling anyone,

00:07:18.075 --> 00:07:20.912
and Naoto, who witnessed it,
also kept silent.

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:28.452
I thought I was the one suffering
the most, since my dad was killed,

00:07:30.221 --> 00:07:32.857
but those guys were carrying
an even heavier burden.

00:07:36.827 --> 00:07:38.529
How were they able to cope with it?

00:07:43.401 --> 00:07:46.003
I can't imagine how Junichi must have felt

00:07:46.938 --> 00:07:48.472
after shooting someone.

00:07:54.312 --> 00:07:55.513
When Naoto

00:07:57.315 --> 00:07:59.951
suggested burying the gun
in the time capsule,

00:08:00.651 --> 00:08:04.255
it wasn't just for me,
but for Junichi as well, huh?

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:07.024
Yeah.

00:08:09.627 --> 00:08:10.928
That's Naoto.

00:08:11.996 --> 00:08:13.097
Back then,

00:08:15.066 --> 00:08:18.569
what would have happened to Junichi
if I hadn't taken that gun with me?

00:08:21.038 --> 00:08:22.974
Would he have been caught?

00:08:34.885 --> 00:08:36.487
Hey Makiko.

00:08:37.288 --> 00:08:38.356
Yeah?

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:43.561
I'll be going now.

00:09:02.213 --> 00:09:03.714
Detective Tobina.

00:09:07.585 --> 00:09:08.953
- Yes?
- What should we do?

00:09:11.055 --> 00:09:12.256
About reporting what I did?

00:09:12.323 --> 00:09:14.692
I mean lunch. What should we do for lunch?

00:09:25.136 --> 00:09:25.970
Um…

00:09:27.805 --> 00:09:30.474
About reporting what happened
to the higher-ups…

00:09:31.375 --> 00:09:32.643
Reporting what?

00:09:37.281 --> 00:09:39.216
About how I shot Oshima 23 years ago.

00:09:39.283 --> 00:09:41.585
Remember what I said?

00:09:41.652 --> 00:09:44.188
What we discussed in the forest
stays strictly between us.

00:09:44.755 --> 00:09:47.024
You meant that for the other three, right?

00:09:47.091 --> 00:09:48.125
No.

00:09:48.192 --> 00:09:50.961
I have no intention of telling
any higher-ups in the police force.

00:09:51.662 --> 00:09:54.532
- Why?
- Because that case isn’t closed yet.

00:09:54.598 --> 00:09:57.368
Then all the more reason to report it.

00:09:58.002 --> 00:10:00.705
Just please keep quiet about this.

00:10:02.406 --> 00:10:03.641
Please.

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:16.487
Even if I keep quiet, that doesn't mean
I can continue being a police officer.

00:10:16.554 --> 00:10:17.922
You're so irritating.

00:10:21.325 --> 00:10:23.160
You’re quitting because the truth is out?

00:10:24.595 --> 00:10:26.897
Would you have continued
if you hadn't been found out?

00:10:28.232 --> 00:10:31.001
What made you become
a police officer in the first place?

00:10:31.869 --> 00:10:34.538
I can't believe you committed a crime
and became

00:10:35.072 --> 00:10:36.507
a police officer.

00:10:37.341 --> 00:10:38.576
It's ridiculous.

00:10:40.511 --> 00:10:41.946
What a mockery.

00:10:54.892 --> 00:10:56.694
That's why I think

00:10:58.629 --> 00:11:02.066
you became a police officer
because you committed a crime.

00:11:06.704 --> 00:11:07.705
Let's eat.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.209
This is not something we should talk about
while eating.

00:11:20.718 --> 00:11:21.886
Delicious.

00:11:31.095 --> 00:11:34.799
The gun that Naoto Sakuma
confessed to have used to kill

00:11:34.865 --> 00:11:36.500
his older brother Hideyuki Sakuma,

00:11:36.567 --> 00:11:39.870
the manager of Smile Sakuma,
has not yet been found.

00:11:39.937 --> 00:11:40.871
Sir.

00:11:41.372 --> 00:11:43.541
We are conducting a search
over a very wide area,

00:11:43.607 --> 00:11:45.743
but we have not found the gun.

00:11:46.243 --> 00:11:48.145
Makiko Iwamoto told us

00:11:48.212 --> 00:11:50.514
she was at the hair salon
on the night of the incident,

00:11:50.581 --> 00:11:52.917
but it turns out that was a lie.

00:11:54.218 --> 00:11:56.520
There were witness reports of someone

00:11:56.587 --> 00:11:57.655
at the hair salon that day,

00:11:57.721 --> 00:12:00.825
but that person was another hairdresser
and not Makiko Iwamoto.

00:12:01.892 --> 00:12:04.829
Therefore, we asked her to
accompany us voluntarily, but she refused.

00:12:04.895 --> 00:12:06.197
That's suspicious.

00:12:06.263 --> 00:12:08.132
The murder weapon hasn’t been found,

00:12:08.199 --> 00:12:10.835
and there is no conclusive evidence
to indict Naoto Sakuma,

00:12:10.901 --> 00:12:12.870
but now Makiko Iwamoto's alibi
has fallen apart.

00:12:12.937 --> 00:12:13.671
PERSON OF INTEREST
MAKIKO IWAMOTO

00:12:13.737 --> 00:12:16.273
It'd be wise to consider the possibility
that Makiko Iwamoto

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:17.942
might know something about the gun.

00:12:18.008 --> 00:12:19.810
We can only have her come in voluntarily?

00:12:19.877 --> 00:12:21.745
Yes, for now.

00:12:22.246 --> 00:12:23.547
What can you tell us

00:12:24.048 --> 00:12:26.116
about Naoto Sakuma’s excursion today?

00:12:27.151 --> 00:12:28.352
What do you mean?

00:12:29.119 --> 00:12:33.357
It seems that Detective Nara and Tobina
took Naoto Sakuma somewhere.

00:12:33.424 --> 00:12:34.325
What?

00:12:35.492 --> 00:12:37.661
Where did you go and what did you do?

00:12:40.931 --> 00:12:43.801
Unfortunately,
I wasn't able to get any results.

00:12:43.868 --> 00:12:45.069
What did you do?

00:12:45.135 --> 00:12:47.371
We went to the river where Naoto Sakuma

00:12:47.438 --> 00:12:50.074
allegedly threw away the gun
and re-examined the location.

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:52.209
We informed him about
Makiko Iwamoto's false alibi

00:12:52.276 --> 00:12:53.744
and tried to pressure him,

00:12:53.811 --> 00:12:55.646
but his statement remained unchanged.

00:12:57.348 --> 00:13:00.150
Is it becoming increasingly difficult
to indict Naoto Sakuma?

00:13:00.217 --> 00:13:02.319
No, we can’t say that for certain.

00:13:02.386 --> 00:13:05.689
However, headquarters
also wants a swift resolution.

00:13:05.756 --> 00:13:09.260
Please continue to do
a thorough search for the murder weapon

00:13:09.326 --> 00:13:13.097
and dedicate all your efforts to achieving
a quick resolution,

00:13:13.163 --> 00:13:14.565
since our reputation is on the line.

00:13:15.065 --> 00:13:16.033
Yes sir.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:21.205
We must find out the truth no matter what.

00:13:22.907 --> 00:13:26.477
INTERROGATION ROOM

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:33.918
We still haven't found the gun
you threw into the river.

00:13:35.386 --> 00:13:37.321
I wonder where it went.

00:13:38.188 --> 00:13:40.491
Maybe it made its way out to sea.

00:13:42.593 --> 00:13:44.895
Oh, that reminds me.

00:13:46.363 --> 00:13:50.000
Ms. Makiko Iwamoto was lying.

00:13:51.835 --> 00:13:54.471
She said she was alone at the hair salon

00:13:54.538 --> 00:13:56.607
on the day of the incident,
but that wasn't true.

00:13:57.107 --> 00:13:58.208
She wasn't there.

00:13:59.209 --> 00:14:00.678
We wanted to hear her side of the story,

00:14:00.744 --> 00:14:02.513
so we asked her to come in voluntarily,

00:14:02.579 --> 00:14:04.048
but she refused.

00:14:06.116 --> 00:14:07.885
Why do you think she did that?

00:14:09.253 --> 00:14:11.488
Because there's nothing in particular
to talk about?

00:14:14.358 --> 00:14:15.893
Do you really believe that?

00:14:17.528 --> 00:14:21.165
I thought you might know the truth.

00:14:22.199 --> 00:14:23.600
The truth?

00:14:26.537 --> 00:14:28.672
After all,

00:14:29.606 --> 00:14:31.976
you're good at keeping people's secrets,
aren't you?

00:14:41.318 --> 00:14:42.619
Mr. Sakuma,

00:14:44.521 --> 00:14:47.758
did you really murder your brother?

00:14:50.828 --> 00:14:51.662
Yes.

00:14:53.097 --> 00:14:54.498
I did it.

00:14:57.368 --> 00:14:58.369
Ms. Nara,

00:14:58.902 --> 00:15:01.872
you whispered something
during the interrogation,

00:15:02.373 --> 00:15:04.375
but was that to prevent it
from being recorded?

00:15:04.875 --> 00:15:06.410
Did I say something?

00:15:06.477 --> 00:15:07.311
What…

00:15:07.378 --> 00:15:10.047
I didn’t say anything, right,
Detective Nagai?

00:15:14.918 --> 00:15:17.755
That's right.
I, Nagai, did not hear anything!

00:15:20.591 --> 00:15:21.592
Wow, finally.

00:15:29.933 --> 00:15:32.503
How was Naoto’s interrogation?

00:15:33.437 --> 00:15:35.139
Please ask Ms. Nara.

00:15:35.205 --> 00:15:37.574
You were taken off the interrogation,

00:15:37.641 --> 00:15:39.676
but you're still her partner.

00:15:42.246 --> 00:15:44.248
You and I have known each other longer.

00:15:44.882 --> 00:15:46.483
By only two months.

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:47.618
That’s more than enough.

00:15:52.389 --> 00:15:54.925
Naoto Sakuma's testimony
remains unchanged.

00:15:54.992 --> 00:15:58.762
He says he committed the murder
and threw the gun into the river.

00:16:00.197 --> 00:16:01.131
Anything else?

00:16:03.634 --> 00:16:06.336
I didn't quite understand what she meant,

00:16:07.071 --> 00:16:09.440
but Ms. Nara told Naoto Sakuma,

00:16:09.506 --> 00:16:10.674
"After all,

00:16:11.175 --> 00:16:13.377
you're good at keeping people's secrets,
aren't you?"

00:16:14.711 --> 00:16:16.780
Ms. Nara was pursuing the angle

00:16:16.847 --> 00:16:19.583
that Naoto Sakuma is protecting
Makiko Iwamoto.

00:16:25.155 --> 00:16:26.156
What else?

00:16:26.957 --> 00:16:28.158
That’s it.

00:16:28.225 --> 00:16:29.460
What else?

00:16:29.526 --> 00:16:30.994
Any little detail will help.

00:16:32.296 --> 00:16:36.333
Oh, for the first time ever,
Ms. Nara said my name correctly.

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:40.504
I don’t care about that.

00:16:41.004 --> 00:16:42.072
Right.

00:16:42.639 --> 00:16:44.741
Does my scalp feel tense?

00:16:44.808 --> 00:16:45.943
Yes, very.

00:16:46.009 --> 00:16:47.678
- Really?
- You must be tired.

00:16:47.744 --> 00:16:48.712
Really?

00:16:48.779 --> 00:16:51.181
That felt amazing.

00:16:51.248 --> 00:16:54.251
Your scalp was tense at first,
but it has loosened up now.

00:16:54.318 --> 00:16:56.920
Your face looks refreshed too.

00:16:56.987 --> 00:16:59.823
It's my first time
getting a scalp treatment.

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:01.058
I'm so glad I came.

00:17:01.125 --> 00:17:02.759
It'll help you sleep well tonight.

00:17:02.826 --> 00:17:04.561
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

00:17:04.628 --> 00:17:05.562
I see.

00:17:05.629 --> 00:17:07.598
Maybe I should recommend it
to Junichi too.

00:17:08.432 --> 00:17:10.200
He hasn't been sleeping well?

00:17:13.337 --> 00:17:15.639
Well, come anytime for a scalp treatment,

00:17:15.706 --> 00:17:18.475
a haircut, a perm, or hair coloring.

00:17:21.345 --> 00:17:22.279
Thank you.

00:17:22.346 --> 00:17:23.614
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.582
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:17:34.892 --> 00:17:36.827
- Hello.
- Welcome.

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.101
Do you have more questions?

00:17:44.601 --> 00:17:46.537
Thank you for the other day.

00:17:48.305 --> 00:17:51.375
Miho, can I ask you to step out
for a little bit?

00:17:51.875 --> 00:17:54.111
Okay. I'll go shopping.

00:17:56.313 --> 00:17:57.214
Excuse me.

00:18:03.287 --> 00:18:05.222
Sorry to bother you at work.

00:18:05.789 --> 00:18:07.391
Yes, it's a bother.

00:18:08.625 --> 00:18:11.328
I would like to talk with you,
Ms. Makiko Iwamoto.

00:18:14.031 --> 00:18:16.233
I refused voluntary accompaniment.

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.101
We can talk here.

00:18:18.168 --> 00:18:19.736
I have a customer in 15 minutes.

00:18:19.803 --> 00:18:21.572
I only need five minutes.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.441
Could you please

00:18:25.375 --> 00:18:26.843
keep what I'm about to tell you

00:18:27.778 --> 00:18:30.013
just between the two of us?

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:44.861
Wanna go somewhere?

00:18:45.429 --> 00:18:46.630
Go where?

00:18:47.231 --> 00:18:49.566
I haven't been able
to take a break in a while so…

00:18:51.101 --> 00:18:52.135
We can do an overnight trip.

00:18:52.636 --> 00:18:56.440
Isn't there a place you've been
wanting to go, but haven't been able to?

00:18:58.008 --> 00:19:01.044
I did have a place,
but I don't want to go there right now.

00:19:01.812 --> 00:19:03.547
Then where do you want to go right now?

00:19:08.585 --> 00:19:09.419
Okay.

00:19:10.754 --> 00:19:14.057
If you won't tell me,
we'll end up going where I want to go.

00:19:14.124 --> 00:19:16.093
I never agreed to go in the first place.

00:19:16.593 --> 00:19:18.462
Oh, come on.

00:19:22.933 --> 00:19:24.601
Let's go somewhere.

00:19:30.107 --> 00:19:31.975
Fine, I guess I can go with you.

00:19:32.809 --> 00:19:33.644
Really?

00:19:34.278 --> 00:19:36.380
That's settled then.

00:19:36.446 --> 00:19:37.914
Think of where to go.

00:19:37.981 --> 00:19:39.116
Stop that.

00:19:40.017 --> 00:19:42.052
Stop it, I'm trying to do homework.

00:19:42.119 --> 00:19:43.787
Come on, just this once.

00:19:43.854 --> 00:19:45.088
Oh, jeez.

00:19:47.991 --> 00:19:48.825
You didn't get lost?

00:19:48.892 --> 00:19:50.827
Yeah. I had no problem.

00:19:50.894 --> 00:19:51.828
I'm glad.

00:19:53.297 --> 00:19:55.632
It seems like you're still
as busy as ever.

00:19:55.699 --> 00:19:56.667
Kind of.

00:20:02.406 --> 00:20:04.675
Do you live near here?

00:20:04.741 --> 00:20:05.709
Yeah.

00:20:05.776 --> 00:20:07.611
It's two stops from here by train.

00:20:07.678 --> 00:20:08.812
Is it an apartment?

00:20:08.879 --> 00:20:09.880
Yeah.

00:20:13.684 --> 00:20:14.618
Oh,

00:20:15.285 --> 00:20:17.721
I was just wondering
what kind of life you lead here.

00:20:17.788 --> 00:20:19.890
Since I've never asked before.

00:20:24.761 --> 00:20:26.396
You wanted to talk about something?

00:20:27.898 --> 00:20:28.732
Yeah.

00:20:31.935 --> 00:20:35.305
Can I let Masaki stay at your place?

00:20:39.142 --> 00:20:41.178
Did Masaki say that he wants to do that?

00:20:44.881 --> 00:20:48.251
He didn't say that exactly…

00:20:48.318 --> 00:20:50.320
Then why all of a sudden?

00:20:51.121 --> 00:20:52.723
Well because…

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:55.158
He's your son.

00:21:00.731 --> 00:21:01.565
You can't do it?

00:21:04.101 --> 00:21:05.435
I can see it on your face.

00:21:08.505 --> 00:21:09.406
Well, um…

00:21:12.876 --> 00:21:13.977
Makiko,

00:21:14.745 --> 00:21:17.948
there's something I've been wanting
to tell you…

00:21:20.751 --> 00:21:22.786
- The thing is…
- Oh.

00:21:25.689 --> 00:21:27.357
Oh, hold on. What's the matter?

00:21:27.424 --> 00:21:28.558
What brings you here?

00:21:29.059 --> 00:21:30.961
My exam ended early.

00:21:45.709 --> 00:21:47.677
This is my wife, Kotono.

00:21:49.146 --> 00:21:50.180
This is Makiko.

00:21:55.252 --> 00:21:57.087
You remarried, huh?

00:21:58.455 --> 00:21:59.322
Yeah.

00:22:02.993 --> 00:22:04.227
I'm sorry.

00:22:04.294 --> 00:22:06.096
- I wasn't aware.
- Well…

00:22:06.163 --> 00:22:08.598
I was just about to tell you about it…

00:22:08.665 --> 00:22:10.600
When did you get married?

00:22:11.968 --> 00:22:13.637
A year ago.

00:22:15.906 --> 00:22:16.873
Sorry.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.009
I should've told you a lot earlier.

00:22:21.344 --> 00:22:22.813
I think I'll leave for now.

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:24.214
- This is for the office.
- Wait.

00:22:24.281 --> 00:22:25.715
- Wait.
- I'm done here, so…

00:22:25.782 --> 00:22:26.783
Wait a minute.

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:29.085
It's okay,
I understand your situation now.

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:32.556
I guess you can't help me
with my earlier request.

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.261
When are you due?

00:22:40.096 --> 00:22:41.398
Next month.

00:22:41.898 --> 00:22:42.732
Wow.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.868
How exciting.

00:22:49.673 --> 00:22:51.708
Then I'll be going now.

00:22:51.775 --> 00:22:53.710
- Makiko.
- No worries.

00:22:54.211 --> 00:22:55.479
It's all right.

00:22:59.416 --> 00:23:00.450
Please, take care.

00:23:01.351 --> 00:23:02.853
Thank you.

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.983
MAKIKO IWAMOTO

00:23:43.693 --> 00:23:44.694
{\an8}Come in.

00:23:49.466 --> 00:23:50.367
Where's Masaki?

00:23:51.101 --> 00:23:51.935
Is he asleep?

00:23:52.435 --> 00:23:55.338
He's not here. He's at my parent's house.

00:23:57.607 --> 00:24:00.944
I don't want Masaki
to hear what I'm about to say.

00:24:07.784 --> 00:24:09.219
Are you hungry?

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:15.325
I think I'll eat after I get home.

00:24:16.226 --> 00:24:17.527
Okay.

00:24:20.797 --> 00:24:22.299
I went to Tokyo today.

00:24:22.799 --> 00:24:23.667
I see.

00:24:24.935 --> 00:24:26.903
I went to see Keisuke.

00:24:28.071 --> 00:24:31.041
Keisuke has remarried.

00:24:33.643 --> 00:24:34.477
What?

00:24:35.712 --> 00:24:36.780
Keisuke?

00:24:37.781 --> 00:24:40.984
Are you serious? Wow.

00:24:41.051 --> 00:24:42.185
What the heck?

00:24:43.486 --> 00:24:44.321
What?

00:24:45.388 --> 00:24:47.057
Junichi, you knew already, didn't you?

00:24:47.123 --> 00:24:50.560
- Huh?
- You already knew. I'm sure of it.

00:24:53.296 --> 00:24:55.498
Even if I did, I had no right to tell you.

00:24:56.099 --> 00:24:57.367
I know that.

00:24:58.234 --> 00:25:01.071
But if that's how I was going to find out,

00:25:01.571 --> 00:25:03.273
I wish I had been told sooner.

00:25:04.641 --> 00:25:05.742
How did you find out?

00:25:06.309 --> 00:25:07.143
Well,

00:25:07.644 --> 00:25:09.946
before Keisuke could tell me about it,

00:25:10.447 --> 00:25:13.450
his wife happened to show up,
and that's how I found out.

00:25:14.584 --> 00:25:15.986
How does that even happen?

00:25:17.787 --> 00:25:19.689
It's okay that you don't know.

00:25:31.801 --> 00:25:32.736
Are you okay?

00:25:38.341 --> 00:25:40.010
I was shocked.

00:25:42.579 --> 00:25:46.549
It never crossed my mind
that he'd get married again.

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.422
Also, when I thought about the fact

00:25:53.323 --> 00:25:56.593
that Keisuke will be with the child
he is about to have,

00:25:57.961 --> 00:26:01.364
but not with Masaki,

00:26:02.332 --> 00:26:04.567
it bothered me a little.

00:26:08.271 --> 00:26:09.539
Even though his remarriage

00:26:10.173 --> 00:26:13.543
and having another child
are both such happy events.

00:26:21.484 --> 00:26:24.587
Was this what you wanted to talk about?

00:26:27.557 --> 00:26:28.858
It wasn't just this.

00:26:31.294 --> 00:26:32.762
It's about Naoto.

00:26:34.064 --> 00:26:34.998
How is he?

00:26:36.866 --> 00:26:37.867
There's been no change.

00:26:39.602 --> 00:26:41.404
He says he did it.

00:26:46.176 --> 00:26:49.179
However, since the murder weapon
hasn't been found,

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.782
and your alibi has been proven wrong,

00:26:55.218 --> 00:26:57.587
there isn't enough conclusive evidence
to file charges.

00:27:02.492 --> 00:27:05.395
I'm a suspect, aren't I?

00:27:06.096 --> 00:27:09.299
The entire investigation team
still considers Naoto to be the culprit.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:11.434
However…

00:27:13.903 --> 00:27:15.772
Ms. Nara suspects you.

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:18.141
What about you?

00:27:28.752 --> 00:27:29.652
First,

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:33.256
I want to hear from you about your alibi
on the night of the incident.

00:27:36.893 --> 00:27:37.827
Sorry.

00:27:39.129 --> 00:27:40.330
Regarding that…

00:27:43.366 --> 00:27:45.301
Can you give me a little more time?

00:27:50.673 --> 00:27:51.641
Okay.

00:27:57.647 --> 00:27:59.215
Are you okay, Junichi?

00:28:06.156 --> 00:28:07.190
Me?

00:28:13.897 --> 00:28:15.465
What about you, Makiko?

00:28:20.036 --> 00:28:22.338
I'm sure you never expected me
to have shot someone.

00:28:26.643 --> 00:28:27.811
Junichi,

00:28:29.512 --> 00:28:31.981
you didn't tell anyone about that, right?

00:28:32.048 --> 00:28:32.882
Yeah.

00:28:36.486 --> 00:28:38.688
I didn't know Naoto had seen me either.

00:28:41.858 --> 00:28:43.059
How did you cope with it?

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:44.394
How did I cope?

00:28:44.894 --> 00:28:47.630
But… I mean…

00:28:47.697 --> 00:28:49.432
I was my usual self, right?

00:28:50.033 --> 00:28:51.501
Is that how

00:28:53.102 --> 00:28:56.539
you've been desperately trying
to keep yourself together every day?

00:28:59.375 --> 00:29:02.045
Because otherwise,
just thinking about that day

00:29:04.013 --> 00:29:05.849
will cause you to fall apart.

00:29:14.357 --> 00:29:15.425
You may be right.

00:29:25.134 --> 00:29:26.436
How did you cope with it?

00:29:35.511 --> 00:29:36.346
I…

00:29:36.412 --> 00:29:38.848
I…

00:29:41.384 --> 00:29:42.218
Are you okay?

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:44.954
I'm okay.

00:29:45.021 --> 00:29:46.122
I'm okay.

00:30:03.373 --> 00:30:07.210
I was desperately trying
to protect myself.

00:30:10.179 --> 00:30:11.748
I was only 12 years old,

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:16.352
so I couldn't be punished legally,

00:30:17.587 --> 00:30:18.788
but

00:30:23.526 --> 00:30:25.328
I could never escape the fear.

00:30:29.032 --> 00:30:30.533
I was obviously…

00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:35.338
scared of people finding out

00:30:38.541 --> 00:30:39.742
who I really was.

00:30:44.681 --> 00:30:46.816
I don't think I deserve to be happy.

00:30:48.818 --> 00:30:50.954
Even when I live with someone,

00:30:52.155 --> 00:30:54.290
I make sure to maintain
a certain emotional distance.

00:30:58.227 --> 00:30:59.295
And…

00:31:02.231 --> 00:31:04.801
I tell myself that there's no point
in blaming myself anymore,

00:31:05.969 --> 00:31:08.137
so I should try to do something useful

00:31:09.172 --> 00:31:10.340
for others.

00:31:11.607 --> 00:31:14.277
But I still feel like that's not enough
to forgive myself.

00:31:18.081 --> 00:31:21.084
When I have nightmares, it's difficult,
but there's also a sense of relief.

00:31:25.355 --> 00:31:26.589
There were moments

00:31:28.725 --> 00:31:31.627
when I truly forgot about that incident.

00:31:33.496 --> 00:31:35.164
Even when I'm talking like this,

00:31:36.132 --> 00:31:38.134
it feels like I'm talking about
someone else.

00:31:39.302 --> 00:31:42.205
Sometimes I lose track of who I am,
and where I am.

00:31:44.407 --> 00:31:45.875
I get confused.

00:31:49.679 --> 00:31:51.080
I get confused…

00:31:52.515 --> 00:31:53.616
And that

00:31:59.088 --> 00:32:00.523
will never change.

00:32:11.167 --> 00:32:12.602
I can't undo the fact…

00:32:17.707 --> 00:32:19.609
that I have committed a crime.

00:33:09.358 --> 00:33:10.393
Sorry about everything.

00:33:11.794 --> 00:33:12.762
Not at all.

00:33:14.864 --> 00:33:15.765
I'll be going now.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.034
Okay.

00:33:29.879 --> 00:33:31.247
Junichi.

00:33:38.321 --> 00:33:39.222
Never mind.

00:33:40.823 --> 00:33:41.757
Bye.

00:33:43.793 --> 00:33:44.627
Bye.

00:33:56.372 --> 00:33:58.508
Could you please keep

00:33:59.108 --> 00:34:00.543
what I'm about to tell you

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:03.412
just between the two of us?

00:34:04.413 --> 00:34:06.149
I can't promise you that.

00:34:06.916 --> 00:34:08.651
Not until I hear what it's about.

00:34:15.224 --> 00:34:19.228
In the forest, Detective Tobina
made a confession, right?

00:34:19.996 --> 00:34:22.632
He said he shot Oshima 23 years ago.

00:34:23.666 --> 00:34:27.370
That may be his misunderstanding.

00:34:28.604 --> 00:34:30.339
- Misunderstanding?
- Yes.

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:33.176
I find it hard to believe

00:34:33.676 --> 00:34:36.479
that the bullet fired by Detective Tobina
hit Oshima.

00:34:37.146 --> 00:34:37.980
What?

00:34:38.047 --> 00:34:41.083
Maybe he never fired the gun
in the first place.

00:34:43.219 --> 00:34:46.322
Is that even possible?

00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:47.256
Yes,

00:34:48.391 --> 00:34:50.526
if my deduction is correct, that is.

00:34:51.761 --> 00:34:52.628
Deduction?

00:34:53.129 --> 00:34:56.232
The key to solving this is that gun,

00:34:56.933 --> 00:34:58.968
but it has not yet been found
in the location

00:34:59.035 --> 00:35:01.337
given to us by Mr. Naoto Sakuma.

00:35:03.206 --> 00:35:06.242
If only we could find the gun,

00:35:06.309 --> 00:35:09.679
we could prove
Detective Tobina's misunderstanding.

00:35:10.947 --> 00:35:12.081
Why am I

00:35:13.082 --> 00:35:14.884
the only one you're sharing this with?

00:35:18.921 --> 00:35:20.790
I wonder why.

00:35:25.861 --> 00:35:28.264
I don't think I deserve to be happy.

00:35:30.466 --> 00:35:32.001
I can't undo the fact…

00:35:33.369 --> 00:35:35.471
that I have committed a crime.

00:36:03.032 --> 00:36:04.533
I'm back.

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:05.935
Welcome back.

00:36:09.639 --> 00:36:11.741
I'm famished.

00:36:12.942 --> 00:36:16.512
I had a sudden craving for nikujaga.

00:36:16.579 --> 00:36:17.780
You made it?

00:36:17.847 --> 00:36:20.049
Yeah. I even made the broth.

00:36:30.693 --> 00:36:31.627
Are you okay?

00:36:32.762 --> 00:36:33.729
Why?

00:36:35.498 --> 00:36:37.333
Were you crying?

00:36:39.201 --> 00:36:40.169
No.

00:36:41.704 --> 00:36:43.973
Oh, but I did yawn.

00:36:47.009 --> 00:36:48.144
That must be it.

00:36:49.145 --> 00:36:50.012
I'm glad.

00:36:56.185 --> 00:36:58.087
KEISUKE KIYOHARA

00:37:00.489 --> 00:37:01.457
It's work.

00:37:01.524 --> 00:37:02.391
Okay.

00:37:06.595 --> 00:37:07.797
Hello?

00:37:08.564 --> 00:37:09.899
I'm getting a bad feeling.

00:37:13.669 --> 00:37:14.537
What's wrong?

00:37:15.504 --> 00:37:17.239
I've been thinking about this a lot,

00:37:17.807 --> 00:37:20.076
but did Naoto really do it?

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:23.846
I can't help but feel like Naoto
is covering for Makiko.

00:37:25.214 --> 00:37:27.583
I wanted to ask Makiko, but I couldn't.

00:37:28.517 --> 00:37:30.386
I don't think Makiko did it either,

00:37:30.453 --> 00:37:32.455
but I just have a bad feeling about this.

00:37:32.521 --> 00:37:35.925
She asked if it would be okay for Masaki
to come and stay at my place.

00:37:37.159 --> 00:37:37.993
Keisuke.

00:37:38.494 --> 00:37:39.328
Yeah?

00:37:44.033 --> 00:37:45.835
Makiko's alibi has fallen apart.

00:37:47.336 --> 00:37:48.371
What do you mean?

00:37:48.437 --> 00:37:51.340
After meeting Makiko at the restaurant,
you went to your hotel,

00:37:51.407 --> 00:37:53.809
and Makiko supposedly
returned to the hair salon.

00:37:55.478 --> 00:37:57.580
But in reality,
she didn't go to the hair salon.

00:37:59.048 --> 00:38:00.449
Then where was she?

00:38:01.884 --> 00:38:02.952
We don't know.

00:38:05.121 --> 00:38:06.655
She's refusing to be questioned.

00:38:08.991 --> 00:38:10.993
She might be willing to tell you.

00:38:11.827 --> 00:38:12.695
No.

00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:16.198
She told me she can't tell me yet.

00:38:16.265 --> 00:38:17.833
What does that even mean?

00:38:18.567 --> 00:38:20.136
What did she do?

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:25.808
What about you, Junichi?

00:38:27.977 --> 00:38:30.479
Do you think that Makiko did it?

00:39:00.142 --> 00:39:01.010
What is it?

00:39:05.648 --> 00:39:07.316
Did you really do it, Naoto?

00:39:08.284 --> 00:39:09.552
Yeah.

00:39:14.857 --> 00:39:18.127
When will I be indicted?

00:39:18.961 --> 00:39:21.230
No charges will be filed
unless we find the gun.

00:39:26.469 --> 00:39:28.637
The police just need to find the gun

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:32.942
at the location I tell you, right?

00:39:33.542 --> 00:39:34.443
Yeah.

00:39:36.245 --> 00:39:37.746
You can make that happen?

00:39:40.149 --> 00:39:42.284
The gun's real location

00:39:43.853 --> 00:39:45.087
isn't the river.

00:39:47.656 --> 00:39:49.792
I hesitated to tell the truth
during the interrogation,

00:39:51.794 --> 00:39:53.963
but I didn't want to mention that place.

00:40:17.987 --> 00:40:19.421
On the day of the wake,

00:40:20.823 --> 00:40:23.792
after the four of us
dug up the time capsule,

00:40:26.095 --> 00:40:27.496
I buried it back in there.

00:40:34.837 --> 00:40:35.971
So that this time for sure,

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:39.742
it would be buried away forever.

00:41:32.795 --> 00:41:33.629
What?

00:41:34.129 --> 00:41:35.497
What do you mean it wasn't there?

00:41:35.564 --> 00:41:36.832
That's what I want to know.

00:41:40.869 --> 00:41:43.105
- It really wasn't there?
- Yeah.

00:41:43.606 --> 00:41:47.209
The soil was soft, so it's possible
someone had dug it up before me.

00:41:50.079 --> 00:41:51.847
No way.

00:41:53.582 --> 00:41:55.417
That's not possible.

00:41:55.985 --> 00:41:57.419
Because…

00:42:00.022 --> 00:42:02.424
The gun will never be found again.

00:42:13.369 --> 00:42:14.370
No.

00:42:15.304 --> 00:42:16.238
No…

00:42:16.305 --> 00:42:18.440
Why?

00:42:21.076 --> 00:42:22.478
No!

00:42:23.746 --> 00:42:25.714
Why, Maki?

00:42:28.951 --> 00:42:30.419
Hello.

00:42:30.486 --> 00:42:31.954
I'm so sorry,

00:42:32.021 --> 00:42:35.424
Manager called and said
that she won't be able to come in.

00:42:39.862 --> 00:42:42.798
I'm supposed to protect you, Maki.

00:42:44.566 --> 00:42:45.567
I too…

00:42:45.634 --> 00:42:47.836
have something I've been shouldering.

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:50.172
There's something I've decided

00:42:51.073 --> 00:42:52.608
to keep locked away in my heart

00:42:54.109 --> 00:42:55.310
for the rest of my life.

00:42:56.645 --> 00:42:58.313
But I just have a bad feeling about this.

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:00.849
Did Naoto really do it?

00:43:00.916 --> 00:43:03.285
I can't help but feel like Naoto
is covering for Makiko.

00:43:09.124 --> 00:43:11.260
Do you think Makiko did it?

00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:15.397
Sorry.

00:43:15.931 --> 00:43:17.132
Regarding that…

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.035
Can you give me a little more time?

00:43:20.102 --> 00:43:21.203
Junichi.

00:43:30.546 --> 00:43:32.648
Does Makiko have the gun?

00:43:39.321 --> 00:43:40.656
How did you cope with it?

00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:42.825
Is that how

00:43:44.426 --> 00:43:46.395
you've been desperately trying

00:43:46.462 --> 00:43:48.097
to keep yourself together every day?

00:43:51.233 --> 00:43:52.768
Because just thinking about that day

00:43:54.169 --> 00:43:56.071
will cause you to fall apart.

00:44:05.414 --> 00:44:06.448
Did Makiko

00:44:08.951 --> 00:44:11.520
{\an8}shoot Hideyuki Sakuma with that gun?

00:44:12.855 --> 00:44:14.656
FINALLY ENTERING THE FINAL CHAPTER

00:44:14.723 --> 00:44:16.458
Makiko is gone.
I can't get in touch with her.

00:44:16.525 --> 00:44:18.260
{\an8}There's something
I've been keeping from you.

00:44:18.327 --> 00:44:19.928
{\an8}If anyone dug it up, it's Makiko.

00:44:19.995 --> 00:44:22.397
{\an8}I'm the one who has to protect Maki.

00:44:22.464 --> 00:44:25.367
{\an8}I'm sorry I haven't been able to
tell you the truth.

00:44:25.434 --> 00:44:26.101
{\an8}WHO CAN THE TRUTH SAVE?

00:44:26.168 --> 00:44:27.803
{\an8}Please help Makiko.

00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:28.771
