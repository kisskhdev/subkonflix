00:00:00.545 --> 00:00:02.495
Grandma wants me to get my memory back quickly.

00:00:03.035 --> 00:00:06.595
Botpleng’s memory should be returning after all.

00:00:07.085 --> 00:00:08.085
Pleng.

00:00:08.755 --> 00:00:09.565
Who?

00:00:09.605 --> 00:00:11.785
If she really wants you to remember things,

00:00:11.825 --> 00:00:14.225
why was she trying to stop you from thinking about the past?

00:00:14.515 --> 00:00:16.515
What if it wasn’t for you to remember things

00:00:16.925 --> 00:00:18.635
but for you to forget certain events?

00:00:19.885 --> 00:00:23.285
If it hurts so much that you need to forget,

00:00:23.715 --> 00:00:24.715
then I

00:00:25.485 --> 00:00:27.045
don’t want you to remember it.

00:00:27.085 --> 00:00:31.285
15 years ago, Sheriff Petchkla, Botpleng’s dad

00:00:31.645 --> 00:00:34.195
was reported for fraud in a wind power concession.

00:00:34.225 --> 00:00:35.605
But isn’t it possible?

00:00:35.645 --> 00:00:37.605
That Thunphob could have found that out

00:00:37.645 --> 00:00:39.155
so he was murdered to silence out.

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:41.215
What if it were me who killed your brother?

00:00:42.105 --> 00:00:43.565
What would you do?

00:01:05.595 --> 00:01:06.595
Hey!

00:01:06.745 --> 00:01:07.685
Hold on!

00:01:07.725 --> 00:01:08.725
Wait up!

00:01:16.505 --> 00:01:17.585
Who are you?

00:01:18.195 --> 00:01:19.395
I’m Botpleng.

00:01:21.655 --> 00:01:22.655
Botpleng.

00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:24.125
Botpleng.

00:01:26.505 --> 00:01:27.505
What’s wrong, Pleng?

00:01:36.245 --> 00:01:37.275
A nightmare?

00:01:39.945 --> 00:01:41.595
More like a strange dream.

00:01:43.075 --> 00:01:44.155
It’s good that you’re here.

00:01:44.965 --> 00:01:46.315
I’m kind of tired.

00:03:53.485 --> 00:03:54.485
Hey.

00:03:56.965 --> 00:03:58.165
Are you trying to energize me?

00:04:00.475 --> 00:04:01.865
You said you’re kind of tired.

00:04:11.105 --> 00:04:12.105
Here.

00:04:12.375 --> 00:04:13.235
Some medicines.

00:04:13.255 --> 00:04:14.255
I’m sorry.

00:04:14.645 --> 00:04:16.525
I forgot that you might have been too worn out.

00:04:21.275 --> 00:04:23.915
When did I say so?

00:04:25.605 --> 00:04:26.785
You said you’re tired.

00:04:29.245 --> 00:04:30.865
It’s not because of last night.

00:04:32.865 --> 00:04:34.105
I just feel like.

00:04:35.165 --> 00:04:37.275
I’ve been having strange dreams these days.

00:04:52.295 --> 00:04:55.955
Dreams can come from many factors.

00:04:56.805 --> 00:04:58.345
But for you,

00:04:58.925 --> 00:05:03.015
the test says you have multiple identities

00:05:05.335 --> 00:05:07.285
hidden within yourself.

00:05:08.405 --> 00:05:10.095
It’s hidden so deep that

00:05:10.505 --> 00:05:11.705
you know it exists,

00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:13.685
but refuse to give anything away.

00:05:18.625 --> 00:05:21.885
Why did I become this way?

00:05:25.145 --> 00:05:28.445
Someone with multiple identities means

00:05:29.085 --> 00:05:30.905
they have more than one self.

00:05:32.535 --> 00:05:37.175
They tend to have been through severe
physical and emotional trauma.

00:05:37.205 --> 00:05:39.645
Or perhaps it’s been piled up for a long time.

00:05:46.185 --> 00:05:47.905
To the extent that you can’t cope

00:05:48.795 --> 00:05:51.025
and created another identity

00:05:52.095 --> 00:05:54.095
so that the original identity

00:05:54.515 --> 00:05:56.465
wouldn’t have to face that trauma.

00:06:03.285 --> 00:06:05.845
It’s the brain’s coping mechanism.

00:06:10.955 --> 00:06:13.565
Which identity is my true self?

00:06:14.565 --> 00:06:15.565
Is it me

00:06:17.535 --> 00:06:19.975
or the other person inside?

00:06:22.445 --> 00:06:23.845
You’re sure

00:06:23.885 --> 00:06:25.845
that there’s another identity hidden inside.

00:06:29.135 --> 00:06:30.655
Otherwise, you wouldn’t have asked

00:06:31.235 --> 00:06:32.715
which one is the true self.

00:06:39.335 --> 00:06:40.405
The thing is…

00:06:45.625 --> 00:06:46.895
You don’t have to say it.

00:06:49.975 --> 00:06:51.205
If you don’t want to.

00:06:56.815 --> 00:06:59.825
The thing is, last night…

00:07:02.105 --> 00:07:03.665
Tankhun and I…

00:07:06.715 --> 00:07:07.925
I felt as if

00:07:09.995 --> 00:07:11.255
it was the first time.

00:07:41.085 --> 00:07:42.815
With your brother’s lover

00:07:43.145 --> 00:07:45.145
who might have killed your brother as well?

00:07:46.885 --> 00:07:48.645
I know what I’m doing.

00:07:50.225 --> 00:07:51.645
And I really do love Pleng.

00:07:53.035 --> 00:07:54.415
Thun’s probably happy

00:07:54.965 --> 00:07:56.345
to know that Pleng is happy.

00:08:00.115 --> 00:08:02.115
Are you putting yourself in Thun’s shoes

00:08:02.155 --> 00:08:06.085
or are you fooling yourself
to do what you want?

00:08:07.215 --> 00:08:09.285
What if Pleng was the one who killed Thun?

00:08:13.015 --> 00:08:14.735
I know my brother well.

00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:18.535
And I know that Thunphob

00:08:19.995 --> 00:08:21.685
can never love a murderer.

00:08:23.605 --> 00:08:25.245
Do you not know Thunphob, Jen?

00:08:30.475 --> 00:08:32.965
But Botpleng’s identities conflict
with one another.

00:08:34.765 --> 00:08:37.265
Just like how he said he never had an affair

00:08:38.095 --> 00:08:40.415
when he had one with Thunphob.

00:08:40.965 --> 00:08:43.265
If the other identity of Botpleng is the real one,

00:08:45.405 --> 00:08:46.485
it means that

00:08:46.525 --> 00:08:49.805
your love does not exist in reality for him.

00:09:01.805 --> 00:09:03.105
Have you talked to your sister?

00:09:04.885 --> 00:09:05.885
Come here.

00:09:07.205 --> 00:09:08.205
Let me help.

00:09:10.765 --> 00:09:11.825
I’m sorry

00:09:12.395 --> 00:09:14.005
for blurting it out like that.

00:09:16.205 --> 00:09:17.725
I just thought of her as a doctor.

00:09:19.045 --> 00:09:21.435
I forgot that she’s also your and Thunphob’s sister.

00:09:22.165 --> 00:09:23.885
Jennaree is a sister who always understands

00:09:24.385 --> 00:09:25.685
both Thunphob and me.

00:09:26.975 --> 00:09:28.115
She’s also a doctor.

00:09:29.365 --> 00:09:32.805
Then, Mr. Doctor’s Brother,

00:09:33.235 --> 00:09:34.285
Please give a diagnosis.

00:09:39.685 --> 00:09:41.325
Jennaree can treat you.

00:09:42.005 --> 00:09:43.375
Using hypnosis along with it

00:09:44.255 --> 00:09:45.705
to find out the truth

00:09:46.105 --> 00:09:47.775
that’s hidden in your other identity.

00:09:48.495 --> 00:09:49.495
The truth

00:09:49.735 --> 00:09:51.155
that might conflict

00:09:51.505 --> 00:09:53.085
with what you are now.

00:10:01.265 --> 00:10:02.885
I think I love you enough

00:10:04.885 --> 00:10:06.865
that my other identity can realize.

00:10:08.285 --> 00:10:09.735
Even if you don’t love me,

00:10:13.565 --> 00:10:15.135
I love you enough

00:10:16.505 --> 00:10:18.075
for all your identities

00:10:20.715 --> 00:10:21.715
to realize.

00:10:47.725 --> 00:10:49.725
Don’t worry about the murder case.

00:10:50.985 --> 00:10:52.045
I’ve found a way

00:10:53.005 --> 00:10:55.095
to lure the real murderer out.

00:10:56.185 --> 00:10:57.375
If I succeed,

00:10:57.985 --> 00:10:59.855
whether you can remember or not

00:10:59.885 --> 00:11:00.975
you and your family

00:11:01.305 --> 00:11:03.025
will no longer be the suspects.

00:11:04.455 --> 00:11:05.545
How are you going to do it?

00:11:06.525 --> 00:11:09.005
We’ve been playing along with
the murderer’s game for too long.

00:11:09.665 --> 00:11:13.065
It’s time we take control.

00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:26.225
How do you know it’s going to work?

00:11:28.245 --> 00:11:32.845
You know I can read people’s minds.

00:11:34.025 --> 00:11:35.615
Have you been secretly reading my mind?

00:11:35.865 --> 00:11:36.945
I wasn’t doing it secretly.

00:11:37.505 --> 00:11:38.765
You have to understand,

00:11:38.805 --> 00:11:41.295
when you can do it, it goes automatically.

00:11:42.635 --> 00:11:43.965
Just like riding a bike.

00:11:44.005 --> 00:11:45.445
After you can do it once, it sticks.

00:11:48.245 --> 00:11:50.245
I have my clothes on, but I feel so naked.

00:11:52.245 --> 00:11:53.285
Stop staring.

00:11:58.525 --> 00:11:59.525
You know what?

00:12:01.825 --> 00:12:03.515
Even with just the sound of your breath,

00:12:05.325 --> 00:12:06.325
I can tell

00:12:07.055 --> 00:12:08.085
what you’re thinking.

00:12:11.485 --> 00:12:12.545
Are you a superhuman?

00:12:20.685 --> 00:12:22.485
Your heavy breathing

00:12:22.895 --> 00:12:24.545
tells that you’re nervous.

00:12:26.445 --> 00:12:30.195
You want my hand to go lower.

00:12:33.905 --> 00:12:35.625
I can read your mind, too.

00:12:37.625 --> 00:12:38.625
It’s you

00:12:38.865 --> 00:12:39.865
who wants it.

00:12:44.275 --> 00:12:45.515
I give up.

00:12:45.975 --> 00:12:46.975
You’re so good.

00:12:49.405 --> 00:12:51.285
That’s why you have to read
Tanu’s mind with me.

00:12:51.385 --> 00:12:52.385
What?

00:12:55.975 --> 00:12:57.105
In this plan,

00:12:57.875 --> 00:12:59.345
you’re the most important part.

00:13:07.855 --> 00:13:08.835
It is said that,

00:13:08.875 --> 00:13:11.815
the luggage serial murder case

00:13:11.855 --> 00:13:14.405
has gotten less spotlight from the press.

00:13:14.455 --> 00:13:15.885
Is that true, Professor Tankhun?

00:13:17.395 --> 00:13:18.395
Yes.

00:13:18.665 --> 00:13:20.855
The police have asked for cooperation
from the press

00:13:20.885 --> 00:13:24.455
so that the investigation will go smoothly.

00:13:25.005 --> 00:13:27.885
That means you’re here today because…

00:13:28.305 --> 00:13:29.305
Yes.

00:13:31.005 --> 00:13:32.495
We have identified the murderer.

00:13:32.935 --> 00:13:38.355
And the murderer is watching the show now.

00:13:40.725 --> 00:13:42.905
Keep an eye on every move in this studio.

00:13:42.935 --> 00:13:44.135
Don’t let anything slip.

00:13:44.165 --> 00:13:45.165
Yes, boss.

00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:46.885
Is the murderer going to come here?

00:13:47.385 --> 00:13:48.525
No one knows.

00:13:49.195 --> 00:13:50.591
But there are a lot of people here.

00:13:50.615 --> 00:13:52.255
We have to block all the risks.

00:13:56.005 --> 00:13:58.035
Do your best on your part.

00:13:58.425 --> 00:13:59.425
Tankhun.

00:14:00.525 --> 00:14:01.805
Is the murderer here?

00:14:02.445 --> 00:14:05.365
The murderer is a coward.

00:14:05.955 --> 00:14:07.155
He wouldn’t dare be here.

00:14:07.645 --> 00:14:08.935
That’s a relief.

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:13.505
But he’s trying to get back at me.

00:14:14.125 --> 00:14:16.785
(Still, you choose to appear on this show?)

00:14:17.725 --> 00:14:18.725
(Yes.)

00:14:19.795 --> 00:14:22.255
(Because I’m sick
of giving him too much spotlight.)

00:14:22.275 --> 00:14:22.805
It’s me.

00:14:22.845 --> 00:14:24.995
(It makes him full of himself.)

00:14:25.045 --> 00:14:27.445
He took over my dad’s show

00:14:27.485 --> 00:14:29.625
and asked me to watch over you
until he’s back.

00:14:29.655 --> 00:14:31.965
(He thinks that he’s a genius murderer)

00:14:32.005 --> 00:14:33.685
(and everyone has to watch out.)

00:14:34.205 --> 00:14:36.085
Even the press doesn’t dare cover his case.

00:14:38.235 --> 00:14:39.685
When in fact,

00:14:40.685 --> 00:14:42.145
he’s just a coward.

00:14:44.375 --> 00:14:47.285
So I want to give people the right facts.

00:14:47.545 --> 00:14:51.685
We have over 200K likes on our live stream.

00:14:51.725 --> 00:14:54.185
Press Like, Share, and spread the word

00:14:54.205 --> 00:14:59.615
so can deliver the right facts
about the murderer to the people.

00:15:00.125 --> 00:15:01.405
What were you saying, Professor?

00:15:03.125 --> 00:15:06.455
The murderer is a loser.

00:15:07.525 --> 00:15:09.115
A gambling addict loser.

00:15:09.375 --> 00:15:10.915
He’s in debt for millions.

00:15:10.945 --> 00:15:13.275
Once he’s lost, he has to take revenge

00:15:13.315 --> 00:15:15.655
on the people who were at the same table.

00:15:17.005 --> 00:15:19.885
Professor Tankhun is acting it out so well.

00:15:19.925 --> 00:15:22.165
He’s making a big show in front of the people

00:15:22.565 --> 00:15:25.035
his only choice is to catch the murderer.

00:15:25.565 --> 00:15:27.965
Otherwise, he has to leave the investigation team

00:15:28.745 --> 00:15:31.465
and lose all the trust of the police
for the rest of his life.

00:15:32.065 --> 00:15:34.815
The police can’t identify the people

00:15:34.845 --> 00:15:36.685
who’ve visited the same casino as the suspect.

00:15:37.065 --> 00:15:38.395
I’d like to warn

00:15:38.415 --> 00:15:40.145
those who frequent the same place

00:15:40.175 --> 00:15:41.195
to be careful.

00:15:41.235 --> 00:15:43.595
You can come forward
and request protection from the police.

00:15:44.215 --> 00:15:47.445
Don’t you think this will give the suspect
a heads-up

00:15:47.475 --> 00:15:49.975
and he will flee to other countries?

00:15:50.005 --> 00:15:51.045
Not at all.

00:15:51.925 --> 00:15:53.925
Because the first witness
who discovered the bodies

00:15:54.365 --> 00:15:56.145
is able to identify the murderer.

00:15:56.725 --> 00:15:59.885
Soon, we will definitely catch the murderer.

00:16:05.205 --> 00:16:06.645
Thanks for helping.

00:16:06.885 --> 00:16:07.885
Yeah.

00:16:08.185 --> 00:16:09.515
Just catch the murderer.

00:16:09.555 --> 00:16:10.875
So you can finally feel relieved.

00:16:11.805 --> 00:16:12.805
I’ll head back.

00:16:13.005 --> 00:16:14.005
Okay.

00:16:47.235 --> 00:16:48.365
Are you afraid?

00:16:49.935 --> 00:16:50.975
You’re here.

00:16:51.245 --> 00:16:53.245
So you make me clean?

00:16:55.625 --> 00:16:57.625
Because I can probably stay at this place.

00:16:58.125 --> 00:17:00.435
It just needs a little cleaning.

00:17:02.835 --> 00:17:03.965
Are you going to move in?

00:17:05.555 --> 00:17:06.555
Maybe.

00:17:08.355 --> 00:17:09.355
Well…

00:17:11.675 --> 00:17:13.545
Though I want to be with my mom,

00:17:14.935 --> 00:17:18.075
but I’m probably not okay living with Grandma

00:17:18.875 --> 00:17:21.345
who brought a doctor who does things to my brain.

00:17:30.455 --> 00:17:31.625
There’s a place

00:17:32.495 --> 00:17:34.295
where no one’s going to mess with your brain.

00:17:36.025 --> 00:17:37.025
Where?

00:17:38.085 --> 00:17:39.285
My house.

00:17:39.325 --> 00:17:40.445
It’s already cleaned, too.

00:17:40.475 --> 00:17:41.875
You don’t have to worry about dust.

00:17:44.245 --> 00:17:46.015
You’re not going to mess with my brain

00:17:47.165 --> 00:17:48.805
but you’re going to mess with my body.

00:17:50.305 --> 00:17:51.955
Don’t try to trick me, I know it.

00:17:53.655 --> 00:17:55.105
You’re telling me not to

00:17:55.935 --> 00:17:58.295
but your eyes are all dreamy.

00:17:58.755 --> 00:17:59.355
Hmm?

00:17:59.685 --> 00:18:00.685
Hmm?

00:18:01.365 --> 00:18:02.685
Stop reading my mind.

00:18:02.715 --> 00:18:03.715
Because I got it right?

00:18:05.295 --> 00:18:06.055
Hmm?

00:18:06.085 --> 00:18:07.245
Hmm?

00:18:10.285 --> 00:18:11.365
Get up!

00:18:12.285 --> 00:18:13.285
Get up?

00:18:14.295 --> 00:18:15.295
Get up on you?

00:18:16.905 --> 00:18:18.495
Why can’t you read my mind this time?

00:18:19.165 --> 00:18:20.535
I mean, stand up!

00:18:20.565 --> 00:18:22.175
You’re sitting on something.

00:18:22.205 --> 00:18:23.205
Oh.

00:18:40.755 --> 00:18:42.085
My dad’s violin.

00:18:44.185 --> 00:18:45.365
It’s not broken yet

00:18:46.525 --> 00:18:48.245
but the sound is probably off tune.

00:18:49.735 --> 00:18:51.175
I think I can do something about it.

00:18:52.165 --> 00:18:53.165
Give it to me.

00:19:32.605 --> 00:19:33.675
(Botpleng!)

00:19:35.545 --> 00:19:36.495
(Botpleng!)

00:19:36.515 --> 00:19:37.675
(Where are you, child?)

00:19:42.985 --> 00:19:43.675
Pleng.

00:19:43.705 --> 00:19:44.965
(Botpleng!)

00:19:45.285 --> 00:19:47.005
(Botpleng, where are you, child?)

00:19:47.035 --> 00:19:48.035
Pleng.

00:19:49.145 --> 00:19:50.315
- (Botpleng!)
- Pleng!

00:19:50.675 --> 00:19:51.675
I’m Tankhun.

00:19:54.555 --> 00:19:55.555
Mom.

00:19:55.775 --> 00:19:56.775
What?

00:19:59.035 --> 00:20:01.035
When you play the violin just now.

00:20:02.635 --> 00:20:04.435
I heard my Mom

00:20:06.575 --> 00:20:08.495
saying “Pleng, my child.”

00:20:25.515 --> 00:20:27.285
I only heard my mom’s voice.

00:20:28.715 --> 00:20:32.485
After that, it’s like my ears are blocked.

00:20:33.015 --> 00:20:34.465
Until you touched me.

00:20:36.665 --> 00:20:38.345
Then next time we see Jen,

00:20:41.095 --> 00:20:42.475
I will play the violin for you.

00:20:42.805 --> 00:20:45.685
If it happens again, then Jen can help you.

00:20:57.035 --> 00:20:58.125
Yes, Inspector?

00:21:00.365 --> 00:21:02.365
Okay, I’ll be there right away.

00:21:05.295 --> 00:21:06.295
Something urgent came up.

00:21:06.725 --> 00:21:07.965
You can stay here alone, right?

00:21:09.085 --> 00:21:10.325
This is my house.

00:21:11.465 --> 00:21:14.065
Being here for a while might help me remember something.

00:22:00.845 --> 00:22:01.885
You’re under arrest.

00:22:09.505 --> 00:22:10.525
Drop your weapon.

00:22:10.965 --> 00:22:12.275
Hands over your head.

00:22:23.145 --> 00:22:24.145
Go!

00:22:35.695 --> 00:22:36.695
You are…

00:22:37.295 --> 00:22:38.945
the best of the class indeed.

00:22:42.005 --> 00:22:43.715
SUSPECTS.
Use flame to lure the fireflies.

00:22:44.065 --> 00:22:47.605
That’s how I’ll lure Tanu and the murderer.

00:22:48.175 --> 00:22:50.655
Do you still think there are 2 of them?

00:22:50.935 --> 00:22:52.865
Only when there is additional evidence

00:22:52.905 --> 00:22:54.625
that I will believe Tanu has DID

00:22:55.125 --> 00:22:56.645
and can execute everything on his own.

00:22:57.705 --> 00:22:58.405
Cool.

00:22:58.645 --> 00:22:59.435
Fair enough.

00:22:59.575 --> 00:23:01.775
I’ll light the fire to lure the firefly in.

00:23:02.085 --> 00:23:03.005
I’ll stir up the news

00:23:03.035 --> 00:23:05.045
that Botpleng could identify the murderer.

00:23:05.085 --> 00:23:07.785
And that the police will be able to
arrest the culprit soon.

00:23:08.445 --> 00:23:09.865
Tanu and the murderer

00:23:09.885 --> 00:23:11.865
must be anxious and jump out
to get Botpleng.

00:23:12.475 --> 00:23:14.865
If Kedsara is actually the one who hired them,

00:23:14.915 --> 00:23:16.525
she would try to convince Botpleng.

00:23:17.365 --> 00:23:18.365
But if not,

00:23:18.645 --> 00:23:20.475
they’d probably try to silence Botpleng out.

00:23:21.555 --> 00:23:23.195
That means,

00:23:23.235 --> 00:23:25.255
you’re going to use Botpleng as bait.

00:23:28.725 --> 00:23:30.085
I’ve been waiting.

00:23:32.645 --> 00:23:33.645
Yes.

00:23:35.305 --> 00:23:36.605
Unbelievable.

00:23:36.645 --> 00:23:38.245
That’s risky.

00:23:39.365 --> 00:23:41.015
Who would let Botpleng be at risk?

00:23:50.115 --> 00:23:51.275
Hurry up and head to the car.

00:23:51.465 --> 00:23:52.901
The police will take you to the safe house.

00:23:52.925 --> 00:23:54.325
No one can know your location.

00:24:03.445 --> 00:24:04.445
You can’t get hurt.

00:24:05.505 --> 00:24:07.045
You have to come back to me safely.

00:24:07.085 --> 00:24:08.085
Understood?

00:24:16.705 --> 00:24:17.705
Go.

00:24:45.685 --> 00:24:46.685
Wake up.

00:24:47.265 --> 00:24:48.265
Wake up.

00:24:50.045 --> 00:24:51.215
(The firefly got caught.)

00:24:57.845 --> 00:25:00.425
The police are taking Botpleng to his mother’s house.

00:25:01.305 --> 00:25:03.835
But I think it’s better for him to stay here.

00:25:04.205 --> 00:25:05.795
Because at least there’s you,

00:25:05.815 --> 00:25:07.445
someone I somewhat have respect for.

00:25:08.095 --> 00:25:09.255
But Botpleng refuses.

00:25:09.875 --> 00:25:11.245
He probably has to take care of his mother.

00:25:11.265 --> 00:25:12.265
I see.

00:25:13.195 --> 00:25:15.125
Or…

00:25:15.165 --> 00:25:16.505
His family’s probably panicking.

00:25:16.545 --> 00:25:17.825
So he’s called home immediately.

00:25:18.565 --> 00:25:19.795
You still think

00:25:20.705 --> 00:25:23.215
the murderer is from Botpleng’s family?

00:25:24.805 --> 00:25:27.125
The only one who went to see Botpleng was Tanu, right?

00:25:27.675 --> 00:25:29.215
DID is pretty solid.

00:25:30.835 --> 00:25:31.975
You got better.

00:25:48.475 --> 00:25:51.595
(All good. I’ll take you to see Tanu tomorrow.)

00:25:56.205 --> 00:25:57.675
You seem so happy, huh?

00:25:59.275 --> 00:26:00.595
While your mom is so sick

00:26:00.625 --> 00:26:02.065
that she could die any day.

00:26:03.755 --> 00:26:06.355
Or is your brain still not functioning like others

00:26:06.885 --> 00:26:09.085
that you didn’t realize your mom is sick?

00:26:11.265 --> 00:26:12.645
I know full well

00:26:13.045 --> 00:26:14.285
that Mom is sick.

00:26:15.445 --> 00:26:17.525
Also, my brain would probably function better

00:26:17.565 --> 00:26:18.845
if no one has messed with it.

00:26:20.375 --> 00:26:21.375
You’re so good, huh?

00:26:22.215 --> 00:26:23.695
Have you remembered anything?

00:26:25.605 --> 00:26:26.605
Why?

00:26:27.205 --> 00:26:28.715
If I could remember,

00:26:29.355 --> 00:26:31.105
would you feel uncomfortable?

00:26:31.125 --> 00:26:31.635
Huh!

00:26:32.075 --> 00:26:33.375
It’s your business

00:26:33.405 --> 00:26:35.245
so you’re the one who should be uncomfortable.

00:26:41.355 --> 00:26:42.725
I already told you

00:26:43.345 --> 00:26:45.541
that I’m not going to get treated by your doctor anymore.

00:26:45.565 --> 00:26:47.035
I already have a personal doctor.

00:26:47.085 --> 00:26:48.385
That’s your business.

00:26:48.425 --> 00:26:49.985
She’s here for me.

00:26:52.355 --> 00:26:53.555
Are you unwell?

00:26:54.815 --> 00:26:55.975
None of your business.

00:26:56.995 --> 00:26:57.995
Follow me.

00:26:58.325 --> 00:26:59.325
Yes, ma’am.

00:27:40.245 --> 00:27:41.245
Pleng.

00:27:44.325 --> 00:27:45.325
Hey.

00:27:46.045 --> 00:27:47.249
You’re here already?

00:27:47.555 --> 00:27:49.081
Why are you so late?

00:27:52.245 --> 00:27:54.065
I’m here on time.

00:27:54.105 --> 00:27:55.385
Oh, really?

00:27:56.465 --> 00:27:59.617
I guess I miss you too much.

00:28:00.525 --> 00:28:02.105
I want to meet you quickly

00:28:02.145 --> 00:28:04.345
so time passed so slowly.

00:28:10.857 --> 00:28:11.857
Pleng.

00:28:12.045 --> 00:28:13.045
Yes?

00:28:13.845 --> 00:28:15.065
Is everything okay?

00:28:16.915 --> 00:28:18.297
You seem a bit off.

00:28:19.655 --> 00:28:21.137
I’m okay.

00:28:22.185 --> 00:28:23.985
I’m Botpleng.

00:28:24.017 --> 00:28:25.273
Do you not recognize me?

00:28:28.765 --> 00:28:29.841
By the way.

00:28:30.875 --> 00:28:31.985
Here’s a sandwich.

00:28:32.425 --> 00:28:33.977
The maid made some.

00:28:34.009 --> 00:28:36.089
No vegetables, no smell.

00:28:37.045 --> 00:28:38.809
You like it like that, right?

00:28:39.245 --> 00:28:40.289
You don’t like vegetables.

00:28:40.725 --> 00:28:43.009
Oh, you didn’t know?

00:28:51.705 --> 00:28:54.081
POLICE STATION.

00:28:54.121 --> 00:28:55.513
Botpleng’s being weird.

00:28:55.561 --> 00:28:56.841
He says things he never said.

00:28:57.115 --> 00:28:58.377
Do things he never did.

00:28:59.135 --> 00:29:00.385
Say, he used to like vegetables

00:29:00.625 --> 00:29:02.105
but today he no longer likes it.

00:29:02.605 --> 00:29:04.881
Maybe it’s because he confuses his memory

00:29:05.295 --> 00:29:07.049
or something affected him.

00:29:07.481 --> 00:29:08.497
Then what is it?

00:29:08.845 --> 00:29:11.081
I can’t tell from what you just told me.

00:29:11.435 --> 00:29:13.601
You have to slowly find out from him.

00:29:14.175 --> 00:29:16.529
Otherwise, get him to see me.

00:29:16.577 --> 00:29:17.705
(Do you have time?)

00:29:18.537 --> 00:29:19.601
Not today.

00:29:19.641 --> 00:29:21.001
I’ll hang up now. Catch you later.

00:29:22.365 --> 00:29:23.281
I’m ready.

00:29:23.321 --> 00:29:24.105
Shall we go?

00:29:24.295 --> 00:29:25.295
Yeah.

00:29:31.435 --> 00:29:33.329
Tanu said he’s not the murderer.

00:29:34.545 --> 00:29:35.929
He broke into Botpleng’s house

00:29:35.953 --> 00:29:37.673
just to steal something.

00:29:37.801 --> 00:29:38.817
To steal something?

00:29:39.585 --> 00:29:41.369
But he went into his bedroom.

00:29:41.965 --> 00:29:43.145
I know.

00:29:43.177 --> 00:29:45.681
I’m making the team question him more.

00:29:46.895 --> 00:29:48.135
Just in case he slips more out.

00:29:49.321 --> 00:29:50.617
I have a plan.

00:29:51.895 --> 00:29:52.895
What is it?

00:29:53.375 --> 00:29:56.673
Tanu approached Botpleng for something.

00:29:58.675 --> 00:30:00.217
Give him what he wants.

00:30:07.545 --> 00:30:08.609
Do you mean me?

00:30:18.097 --> 00:30:20.953
POLICE STATION.

00:30:21.225 --> 00:30:22.545
I’ve already told you everything.

00:30:23.165 --> 00:30:24.417
There’s nothing else to say.

00:30:24.825 --> 00:30:25.825
Okay.

00:30:27.445 --> 00:30:29.205
If you don’t have anything else to say to me

00:30:32.395 --> 00:30:33.649
then what about to this person?

00:30:35.165 --> 00:30:36.369
Do you have anything to say?

00:30:56.135 --> 00:30:57.329
Why did you come to see me?

00:30:58.455 --> 00:30:59.465
What did you want?

00:31:01.365 --> 00:31:02.721
You know me, right?

00:31:09.095 --> 00:31:10.095
I know

00:31:10.955 --> 00:31:12.713
that you used to work for my mom.

00:31:14.995 --> 00:31:17.115
Either Mom or Grandma asked you to come to me, right?

00:31:17.885 --> 00:31:19.081
You can tell me.

00:31:20.193 --> 00:31:22.195
I won’t tell Mom and Grandma that you said it.

00:31:22.925 --> 00:31:24.081
You secret,

00:31:25.695 --> 00:31:26.969
I’ll keep it to myself.

00:31:35.475 --> 00:31:36.475
Get out.

00:31:39.285 --> 00:31:40.753
You have nothing to do with this.

00:31:42.295 --> 00:31:43.295
Get out!

00:31:43.855 --> 00:31:44.905
Get out!

00:31:45.195 --> 00:31:46.585
Get out!

00:31:46.609 --> 00:31:47.737
Get out!

00:31:48.705 --> 00:31:49.705
Get out!

00:31:50.475 --> 00:31:51.241
Get out!

00:31:51.273 --> 00:31:52.057
Get out!

00:31:52.089 --> 00:31:53.089
Get out!

00:32:57.505 --> 00:32:58.505
Pleng!

00:32:58.995 --> 00:32:59.995
Pleng!

00:33:02.515 --> 00:33:04.145
Pleng, are you okay?

00:33:06.225 --> 00:33:07.401
It’s getting clearer.

00:33:08.115 --> 00:33:09.115
What?

00:33:09.645 --> 00:33:10.649
The image of him.

00:33:23.833 --> 00:33:24.929
I know him.

00:33:53.377 --> 00:33:54.377
Stay with me.

00:33:58.185 --> 00:33:59.265
Don’t leave.

00:34:01.285 --> 00:34:02.433
Even if you don’t say it,

00:34:03.275 --> 00:34:04.633
I wasn’t going to go anywhere.

00:34:37.645 --> 00:34:38.681
Oh, hey!

00:34:39.135 --> 00:34:40.337
You hit the gym here, too?

00:34:43.815 --> 00:34:45.233
This is your first time.

00:34:46.275 --> 00:34:47.337
What?

00:34:47.385 --> 00:34:48.777
I’m here often.

00:34:50.595 --> 00:34:51.905
That wristband

00:34:52.435 --> 00:34:54.089
it’s only for new members

00:34:54.495 --> 00:34:56.209
so the trainers can take care of you.

00:34:56.833 --> 00:34:58.835
I know it because I got one last month.

00:34:59.595 --> 00:35:00.977
This is your first day, is it?

00:35:03.325 --> 00:35:05.201
Can anyone ever fool you?

00:35:05.625 --> 00:35:07.153
At least not you.

00:35:07.177 --> 00:35:08.209
What do you want?

00:35:08.425 --> 00:35:09.681
I just…

00:35:10.715 --> 00:35:13.849
want to ask because
our close persons are dating.

00:35:14.105 --> 00:35:15.105
Get to the point.

00:35:17.005 --> 00:35:18.977
How’s my friend and your brother doing so far?

00:35:19.401 --> 00:35:20.817
If it’s about that

00:35:20.841 --> 00:35:22.425
isn’t it better to ask your friend?

00:35:23.805 --> 00:35:24.929
Come on.

00:35:25.685 --> 00:35:28.241
He’d think I still have feelings for him.

00:35:28.895 --> 00:35:30.745
He’s stressed out enough.

00:35:30.769 --> 00:35:32.449
I don’t want to give him more stress.

00:35:33.255 --> 00:35:34.313
I’m worried about him.

00:35:36.445 --> 00:35:39.169
Instead of worrying about Pleng and Tan’s love,

00:35:39.209 --> 00:35:41.165
you should worry whether Pleng is going to jail.

00:35:42.285 --> 00:35:43.285
What?

00:35:44.485 --> 00:35:45.657
Don’t you remember?

00:35:45.975 --> 00:35:47.737
What Pleng is afraid of the most

00:35:48.225 --> 00:35:50.265
is that he could be the one who killed Thunphob.

00:35:50.965 --> 00:35:52.505
If his memory returns

00:35:53.685 --> 00:35:56.329
and Pleng is really the one who brought death to Thunphob,

00:35:57.125 --> 00:35:59.337
no matter how much Pleng loves Tan,

00:36:00.365 --> 00:36:01.665
I’ll throw him in jail.

00:36:02.035 --> 00:36:03.035
Hey.

00:36:03.715 --> 00:36:05.177
It’s just his fear.

00:36:05.905 --> 00:36:08.049
Pleng probably wouldn’t have done such a thing.

00:36:08.913 --> 00:36:10.915
You can’t just assume with things like this.

00:36:11.235 --> 00:36:12.745
You need proof.

00:36:13.885 --> 00:36:15.425
If you’re so worried about your friend,

00:36:15.449 --> 00:36:16.769
then go and find the proof

00:36:16.793 --> 00:36:17.793
that Pleng didn’t do it.

00:36:33.217 --> 00:36:35.753
I normally don’t get interviewed by the press.

00:36:35.801 --> 00:36:36.977
Please go ahead.

00:36:37.385 --> 00:36:39.385
Then, please allow me to record this.

00:36:45.995 --> 00:36:49.905
I want to know about the concession project.

00:36:50.145 --> 00:36:52.425
This year, we have the concession projects

00:36:52.473 --> 00:36:55.065
on transportation and the new expressway.

00:36:55.105 --> 00:36:57.265
No, sheriff, I’m talking about

00:36:57.297 --> 00:37:00.601
the wind power concession project

00:37:00.649 --> 00:37:02.041
15 years ago.

00:37:32.045 --> 00:37:33.177
Kissable, isn’t it?

00:37:35.645 --> 00:37:36.645
No.

00:37:42.805 --> 00:37:43.849
No, indeed.

00:37:50.015 --> 00:37:51.015
Hmm!

00:37:53.505 --> 00:37:55.017
Stop eating up my lips.

00:37:55.695 --> 00:37:56.849
I want to eat some food.

00:37:57.655 --> 00:37:58.761
What do you want to eat?

00:37:59.885 --> 00:38:00.885
Umm…

00:38:03.215 --> 00:38:04.601
Stir-fried Chinese broccoli with crispy pork.

00:38:04.625 --> 00:38:05.625
Make it spicy, too.

00:38:07.625 --> 00:38:08.625
Really?

00:38:09.205 --> 00:38:10.521
Why are you making that face?

00:38:10.885 --> 00:38:11.885
Is it too hard?

00:38:12.565 --> 00:38:13.289
No.

00:38:13.465 --> 00:38:14.817
I’m just happy

00:38:15.165 --> 00:38:17.005
to see you have vegetables for the first time.

00:38:58.605 --> 00:39:00.525
When did you secretly start planting vegetables?

00:39:04.005 --> 00:39:05.649
Since I knew you liked vegetables.

00:39:06.685 --> 00:39:08.481
So I asked someone to plant them for you.

00:39:10.535 --> 00:39:11.777
Aren’t you going a bit overboard?

00:39:11.801 --> 00:39:12.921
This is your house.

00:39:18.565 --> 00:39:20.257
Shall we have a puppy?

00:39:21.215 --> 00:39:22.441
Or a cat?

00:39:24.115 --> 00:39:25.457
Or both?

00:39:25.965 --> 00:39:27.045
So they wouldn’t be lonely.

00:39:28.605 --> 00:39:29.889
Everything here

00:39:30.525 --> 00:39:31.525
is yours.

00:39:32.755 --> 00:39:33.985
I’m yours.

00:39:35.675 --> 00:39:36.753
From the day

00:39:37.565 --> 00:39:38.569
that you love me.

00:39:44.485 --> 00:39:45.485
I…

00:39:47.165 --> 00:39:48.881
Will be the second violin

00:39:50.521 --> 00:39:52.525
in your Canon in D, always.

00:39:55.755 --> 00:39:57.329
So I become a completed melody.

00:40:47.355 --> 00:40:48.817
Who are you?

00:40:48.849 --> 00:40:50.313
And where are you?

00:41:02.073 --> 00:41:04.075
(My name is…)

00:41:04.113 --> 00:41:05.977
I think your apartment is a bit too empty.

00:41:06.009 --> 00:41:07.793
I’ve never thought of that place as my home.

00:41:07.841 --> 00:41:09.353
But I want to make it a home.

00:41:10.015 --> 00:41:11.137
Wherever you are

00:41:11.945 --> 00:41:13.081
that’s where home is.

00:41:14.265 --> 00:41:16.593
Maybe it’s the trigger of the hypnosis.

00:41:16.633 --> 00:41:18.569
The strings on your dad’s violin have been changed.

00:41:18.593 --> 00:41:20.593
That’s why it doesn’t sound like any other violin.

00:41:20.945 --> 00:41:23.073
Right now, you’re 18 years old.

00:41:23.705 --> 00:41:25.705
You were in a long sleep.

00:41:25.737 --> 00:41:28.257
If that family can make Pleng forget everything,

00:41:28.273 --> 00:41:29.297
everything’s over.

00:41:30.405 --> 00:41:31.689
I have a lover.

00:41:32.165 --> 00:41:33.225
His name is Tankhun.

00:41:33.595 --> 00:41:34.185
Tan–.

00:41:34.233 --> 00:41:35.977
Die!

00:41:35.993 --> 00:41:36.705
Die!

00:41:36.729 --> 00:41:37.673
I’m right here, Mom.

00:41:37.715 --> 00:41:38.881
That means digging up my dad’s case

00:41:38.905 --> 00:41:41.049
was not what triggers the murderer.

00:41:41.065 --> 00:41:43.045
So why did they kill my parents’ subordinates?

00:41:43.465 --> 00:41:45.049
What if something else was the trigger?

00:41:46.455 --> 00:41:47.455
Hey!
