(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

00:00:40.085 --> 00:00:41.185
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

00:00:41.685 --> 00:00:42.755
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

00:01:06.605 --> 00:01:08.145
We have only one goal.

00:01:09.345 --> 00:01:11.485
To connect. To bring people together.

00:01:20.725 --> 00:01:23.155
Our real fight begins now.

00:01:25.765 --> 00:01:29.235
If you're watching this right now, please reach out to us.

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:31.465
We will...

00:01:32.365 --> 00:01:33.365
take your hand.

00:01:37.575 --> 00:01:39.245
(Episode 4)

00:02:08.935 --> 00:02:10.505
I think someone's hurt.

00:02:11.105 --> 00:02:12.745
I heard a scream.

00:02:13.715 --> 00:02:16.985
It's a house in front of the park on Seongil-gu, Jungam-ro.

00:02:18.445 --> 00:02:21.415
The day Lee Jun Hyeok died, Hyun Jin was here.

00:02:25.185 --> 00:02:26.555
Was that her first time?

00:02:28.425 --> 00:02:29.725
Why did she come here?

00:02:33.395 --> 00:02:36.095
(Seoul Han Hospital)

00:02:39.135 --> 00:02:41.135
Wake up. You're late.

00:02:47.215 --> 00:02:49.875
Is that any way to talk to a friend who almost died?

00:02:50.415 --> 00:02:51.645
That's harsh.

00:02:52.215 --> 00:02:53.585
Are you with us? Feeling okay?

00:02:53.855 --> 00:02:55.215
Not at all.

00:02:55.885 --> 00:02:57.055
This is so unfair.

00:02:57.525 --> 00:03:00.055
If it had been one-on-one, I totally would've won.

00:03:00.395 --> 00:03:02.595
Gosh, this is so embarrassing.

00:03:03.155 --> 00:03:04.165
Looks like she's fine.

00:03:05.925 --> 00:03:07.165
What exactly happened?

00:03:07.495 --> 00:03:09.895
Witnesses said you just collapsed in front of the station.

00:03:10.295 --> 00:03:12.034
What do you mean, "just collapsed"?

00:03:12.035 --> 00:03:14.175
Hey, some jerk...

00:03:14.775 --> 00:03:16.575
stabbed me from behind and took off.

00:03:21.375 --> 00:03:22.375
Look at this.

00:03:28.185 --> 00:03:29.785
That jerk must have stamped this on me.

00:03:30.525 --> 00:03:31.555
The jerk who stabbed me.

00:03:39.865 --> 00:03:41.195
Yes, what about the subway's CCTV footage?

00:03:43.235 --> 00:03:45.465
Got it. I'll head over as soon as I check on my wife.

00:03:49.205 --> 00:03:51.545
My car and that stamp.

00:03:52.675 --> 00:03:53.715
What about the dashcam?

00:03:55.115 --> 00:03:57.845
They took the memory card. The CCTVs don't cover that spot.

00:04:01.155 --> 00:04:02.355
Remember that wine?

00:04:03.355 --> 00:04:06.685
- The one for our anniversary. - A 2005 vintage?

00:04:07.125 --> 00:04:09.195
It must've been from the alumni association.

00:04:09.625 --> 00:04:11.165
Then maybe that was also...

00:04:14.595 --> 00:04:15.595
This is a warning.

00:04:17.105 --> 00:04:18.505
A warning that they know what happened.

00:04:19.565 --> 00:04:21.375
Who on earth?

00:04:23.675 --> 00:04:24.675
Hyun Jin.

00:04:26.475 --> 00:04:27.475
Are you all right?

00:04:28.745 --> 00:04:30.915
- I'm sorry about yesterday... - Don't worry about it.

00:04:31.345 --> 00:04:33.145
It comes with being married to a detective.

00:04:33.755 --> 00:04:35.285
Really, I'm totally fine.

00:04:35.615 --> 00:04:37.325
Did the tox screen results come back?

00:04:38.025 --> 00:04:39.155
They found traces of heroin.

00:04:39.725 --> 00:04:40.725
Heroin?

00:04:40.895 --> 00:04:44.525
Luckily, it was just a trace amount. Any more would have been dangerous.

00:04:47.135 --> 00:04:50.865
Does anyone come to mind? Like someone who holds a grudge.

00:04:53.365 --> 00:04:54.375
Not really.

00:04:58.205 --> 00:05:00.815
Maybe it was just a random attack or something?

00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:04.345
With heroin?

00:05:07.355 --> 00:05:09.355
Have the police secured the CCTV footage?

00:05:09.685 --> 00:05:11.125
We'd like to review it as well.

00:05:12.225 --> 00:05:15.255
Yes, the detective is my junior. I was heading over there anyway.

00:05:17.225 --> 00:05:19.995
And yesterday, on the back of your hand...

00:05:24.035 --> 00:05:25.035
The back of my hand?

00:05:28.375 --> 00:05:31.275
Let's get you checked out first. I'll go talk to the nurse's station.

00:06:00.975 --> 00:06:01.975
Wait. About Hyun Jin.

00:06:03.005 --> 00:06:06.205
By any chance, before Reporter Lee Jun Hyeok died,

00:06:06.875 --> 00:06:08.175
did she ever meet with him privately?

00:06:10.075 --> 00:06:11.115
Why are you asking me that?

00:06:11.815 --> 00:06:13.785
Because you're the ones who know Hyun Jin best.

00:06:14.385 --> 00:06:16.155
You and Ra Young.

00:06:16.655 --> 00:06:17.755
Maybe even more than I do.

00:06:21.095 --> 00:06:22.995
It's funny how people can be so fickle.

00:06:23.965 --> 00:06:27.465
Just now, you were a nervous wreck, worried she wouldn't make it.

00:06:27.935 --> 00:06:30.735
It seemed like all you wanted was for Hyun Jin to wake up,

00:06:31.005 --> 00:06:33.565
but now that she is, that feeling's vanished, hasn't it?

00:06:34.635 --> 00:06:37.675
Would you still be asking me this if Hyun Jin hadn't made it?

00:06:41.775 --> 00:06:43.215
Yes, they met.

00:06:43.845 --> 00:06:44.945
She was requesting files for a story.

00:06:55.395 --> 00:06:57.125
- Delivery! - Hold on, one second!

00:06:57.195 --> 00:06:58.725
- Seriously, what should we do? - This is insane.

00:06:58.795 --> 00:06:59.795
What is this?

00:06:59.865 --> 00:07:02.165
I'm telling you, we didn't place this order.

00:07:02.665 --> 00:07:04.035
Why should we pay for something we didn't order?

00:07:04.105 --> 00:07:07.065
It's an order for 20 lunch boxes. So how are we getting paid?

00:07:07.335 --> 00:07:08.335
What's all this?

00:07:08.405 --> 00:07:10.535
Someone's bombarding us with malicious prank orders.

00:07:11.305 --> 00:07:13.975
Isn't this the kind of thing phishing scammers do for revenge?

00:07:14.875 --> 00:07:16.875
Every time we air a story, we get flooded with these "gifts."

00:07:17.585 --> 00:07:19.415
Pay for all the deliveries.

00:07:20.185 --> 00:07:21.285
What are you going to do with all this?

00:07:21.555 --> 00:07:24.155
If we send it all back, what will the restaurant owners do?

00:07:24.485 --> 00:07:25.485
We'll buy everything...

00:07:25.785 --> 00:07:28.695
and donate it to the nearby shelters and homeless outreach centers.

00:07:29.155 --> 00:07:32.065
Let's run a few stories on this. That'll buzz off whoever did this.

00:07:33.065 --> 00:07:36.495
- Understood. - Has anyone been looking for me?

00:07:36.765 --> 00:07:39.865
No. You have no meetings today.

00:07:40.405 --> 00:07:42.105
Someone named Han Min Seo should be coming soon.

00:07:42.435 --> 00:07:43.575
Bring her straight to me.

00:08:36.325 --> 00:08:38.425
You've been staring at the same page for 20 minutes.

00:08:39.895 --> 00:08:42.165
Here, have one. I set a few aside for us.

00:08:43.535 --> 00:08:44.705
Can you believe this?

00:08:45.165 --> 00:08:46.735
Not a single person has tried to contact us.

00:08:49.775 --> 00:08:52.005
These guys have no class.

00:08:52.275 --> 00:08:54.675
If they were going to send them, they could've sent the best.

00:08:55.075 --> 00:08:59.485
Surely someone saw my show. One must want to quit Connect.

00:09:00.815 --> 00:09:02.855
I didn't stir up all that trouble just to get nonsense like this.

00:09:04.455 --> 00:09:06.355
Maybe that's just how scared they are.

00:09:06.655 --> 00:09:08.925
Those guys killed Reporter Lee and Jo Yoo Jeong.

00:09:09.295 --> 00:09:11.765
There's no way the women in there don't know what they're capable of.

00:09:12.765 --> 00:09:14.895
It won't be easy for them to actually come forward.

00:09:15.195 --> 00:09:16.595
That goes for Han Min Seo too.

00:09:19.505 --> 00:09:21.105
Where did you say Han Min Seo works again?

00:09:23.075 --> 00:09:24.405
If she's too scared to come to us,

00:09:25.475 --> 00:09:26.475
then I'll go to her.

00:09:31.085 --> 00:09:33.185
You still can't tell which fork goes where?

00:09:34.385 --> 00:09:37.215
Is it that hard to tell a wine glass from a water goblet?

00:09:38.025 --> 00:09:39.925
Did you even graduate high school? Feels more like grade school.

00:09:40.085 --> 00:09:41.155
But I wasn't the one who did it.

00:09:41.495 --> 00:09:43.995
- What? - I didn't set this table.

00:09:50.365 --> 00:09:51.365
And your shoes?

00:09:51.735 --> 00:09:53.205
Did someone else put those on for you too?

00:09:53.765 --> 00:09:55.735
You want another complaint about lowering our standards?

00:09:56.635 --> 00:09:58.005
Order up for table 12.

00:10:00.105 --> 00:10:01.745
Just go take their order.

00:10:12.055 --> 00:10:13.125
Are you ready to order?

00:10:14.925 --> 00:10:16.895
The camera doesn't do me justice, does it?

00:10:21.165 --> 00:10:22.395
It's a pleasure to meet you, Han Min Seo.

00:10:22.735 --> 00:10:23.735
I'm Yoon Ra Young.

00:10:26.605 --> 00:10:28.575
Why didn't you come? I've been waiting for you.

00:10:31.945 --> 00:10:34.675
- What do you think you're doing? - You could've at least called.

00:10:35.075 --> 00:10:36.415
Then I wouldn't have been so worried.

00:10:37.645 --> 00:10:39.345
- If you're not going to order... - I'll have the Course A.

00:10:39.945 --> 00:10:41.015
No wine.

00:10:52.095 --> 00:10:53.095
Han Min Seo!

00:10:55.565 --> 00:10:56.895
I said I would come to you.

00:10:57.335 --> 00:10:59.235
I didn't tell you to show up here like this.

00:10:59.305 --> 00:11:01.275
Why are you putting me in such a difficult position?

00:11:01.605 --> 00:11:02.605
I was worried about you.

00:11:03.205 --> 00:11:06.305
A place like that? Anything could've happened to you.

00:11:09.045 --> 00:11:10.315
You're hesitating, aren't you?

00:11:12.015 --> 00:11:13.085
Just come to us.

00:11:29.195 --> 00:11:30.295
I promise you.

00:11:31.205 --> 00:11:32.565
I'll put everything on the line,

00:11:34.435 --> 00:11:36.205
that I won't let you get hurt.

00:11:40.275 --> 00:11:42.875
What, do you think I'm some kind of charity case?

00:11:43.115 --> 00:11:45.415
There are only three pairs in Korea, and I bought one.

00:11:45.915 --> 00:11:47.585
I want to wear them on my show next week,

00:11:48.215 --> 00:11:49.585
so you'll have to come and return them to me.

00:12:00.225 --> 00:12:03.335
That table from earlier wasn't set by Han Min Seo.

00:12:03.935 --> 00:12:06.035
- Excuse me? - I'm Han Min Seo's lawyer.

00:12:06.365 --> 00:12:10.875
In 2019, the labor law was amended to prohibit workplace harassment.

00:12:11.145 --> 00:12:12.275
You might want to brush up on that.

00:12:12.705 --> 00:12:14.075
Public humiliation, and defamation of character.

00:12:14.475 --> 00:12:16.015
Unless you want to be buried in lawsuits.

00:12:31.995 --> 00:12:33.265
Are you sure you're okay?

00:12:33.665 --> 00:12:35.294
- What? - Weren't you supposed to stay...

00:12:35.295 --> 00:12:36.335
in the hospital for another day?

00:12:37.905 --> 00:12:39.705
The way I feel right now,

00:12:40.165 --> 00:12:43.935
I could set a marathon record. Do you want me to prove it?

00:12:44.605 --> 00:12:46.875
Just don't overdo it for the next few days.

00:12:46.945 --> 00:12:50.575
Goodness, all right. I get it.

00:12:54.415 --> 00:12:56.015
The day Reporter Lee Jun Hyeok died...

00:12:59.325 --> 00:13:00.855
You went to his house, didn't you?

00:13:06.525 --> 00:13:08.135
I think someone's hurt.

00:13:08.735 --> 00:13:10.265
I heard a scream.

00:13:11.335 --> 00:13:14.575
It's a house in front of the park on Seongil-gu, Jungam-ro.

00:13:23.715 --> 00:13:25.485
- Honey. - What I'm about to say...

00:13:25.845 --> 00:13:27.615
I'm going to forget everything after this moment.

00:13:27.955 --> 00:13:30.615
And I'll never speak of it again for as long as I live.

00:13:33.485 --> 00:13:36.095
You know that, right? If there's one thing about me,

00:13:36.395 --> 00:13:38.395
it's that I'm a man of my word.

00:13:40.265 --> 00:13:41.335
So please,

00:13:42.195 --> 00:13:43.195
just be honest with me.

00:13:45.905 --> 00:13:48.475
Why did you go to Reporter Lee's house?

00:14:04.185 --> 00:14:05.425
Jun Hyeok...

00:14:06.785 --> 00:14:08.525
was supposed to give me some files.

00:14:11.665 --> 00:14:12.795
That's why I went there.

00:14:13.825 --> 00:14:15.365
And that's where I found him.

00:14:17.435 --> 00:14:19.135
Jun Hyeok was dead.

00:14:21.205 --> 00:14:22.335
Is that really the whole story?

00:14:25.805 --> 00:14:27.175
Why didn't you tell me?

00:14:30.645 --> 00:14:31.915
You have to admit,

00:14:33.085 --> 00:14:34.755
the whole situation looked suspicious.

00:14:36.885 --> 00:14:38.855
But Ra Young and Shin Jae knew, didn't they?

00:14:39.355 --> 00:14:41.225
That you went to Reporter Lee's house that day.

00:14:42.825 --> 00:14:43.825
Yes.

00:14:47.665 --> 00:14:49.395
You and your friends...

00:14:50.195 --> 00:14:52.235
Your bond looked so perfect at first I was almost jealous.

00:14:53.135 --> 00:14:54.735
Like sisters, or even family.

00:14:55.135 --> 00:14:56.435
I wondered, "Are all women like this?"

00:14:56.735 --> 00:14:58.245
"Does a bond like this really exist?"

00:14:59.475 --> 00:15:00.545
But...

00:15:02.115 --> 00:15:03.115
the bond you have...

00:15:04.115 --> 00:15:05.315
is...

00:15:06.185 --> 00:15:07.185
different.

00:15:10.355 --> 00:15:14.025
Are you saying you're jealous of Ra Young and Shin Jae?

00:15:17.055 --> 00:15:19.665
Let's just drop it and go to sleep. I'm tired.

00:15:23.265 --> 00:15:25.735
Do you know what else gives me this same feeling?

00:15:28.905 --> 00:15:29.905
Accomplices.

00:15:32.475 --> 00:15:34.545
Their fates are bound together.

00:15:35.045 --> 00:15:36.275
If one of them goes down,

00:15:37.015 --> 00:15:39.385
the other is bound to go down with them.

00:15:40.845 --> 00:15:41.955
Is there really nothing else about you...

00:15:42.555 --> 00:15:45.025
that I should know?

00:16:06.075 --> 00:16:07.075
There isn't.

00:16:16.955 --> 00:16:17.955
This is a warning.

00:16:18.555 --> 00:16:19.985
A warning that they know about it.

00:16:44.545 --> 00:16:48.285
When you start taking photos, you just want to avoid backlighting.

00:16:48.585 --> 00:16:52.385
Since the subject's face and details get completely lost in shadow.

00:16:53.155 --> 00:16:56.495
But sometimes you have to use that backlighting to your advantage.

00:16:56.555 --> 00:16:59.565
It shows the true outline that's invisible in bright light.

00:16:59.765 --> 00:17:02.995
Letting you see the silhouette in perfect clarity.

00:17:05.135 --> 00:17:08.175
Sometimes, the truth is hiding just behind the light.

00:17:09.175 --> 00:17:11.845
Photography is about using every element in the environment...

00:17:12.145 --> 00:17:14.075
to capture the truth that lies just beneath the surface.

00:17:25.685 --> 00:17:26.685
Kang Shin Jae?

00:17:28.455 --> 00:17:30.725
It's been a while. Do you have a minute?

00:17:33.625 --> 00:17:34.635
Here.

00:17:42.335 --> 00:17:44.035
You've always been into photography.

00:17:44.605 --> 00:17:46.244
- And you're still at it. - They asked me...

00:17:46.245 --> 00:17:48.515
to advise the club. It's just a hobby.

00:17:49.475 --> 00:17:52.045
Anyway, what brings you to campus?

00:17:52.285 --> 00:17:54.555
I came to check on something.

00:17:55.585 --> 00:17:58.025
We received a gift at our law firm's anniversary party,

00:17:58.685 --> 00:18:01.025
and I thought it might have been from the alumni association.

00:18:01.955 --> 00:18:02.955
A gift?

00:18:03.395 --> 00:18:06.925
- What was it? - Wine. A 2005 vintage.

00:18:08.065 --> 00:18:10.295
From 2005?

00:18:10.895 --> 00:18:13.835
Yes. That's the year we were all here at school,

00:18:13.905 --> 00:18:14.905
so I thought there might be a link.

00:18:15.705 --> 00:18:18.575
Right. So what did the alumni association say?

00:18:19.245 --> 00:18:20.245
That they didn't send it.

00:18:25.085 --> 00:18:26.685
This came with it too.

00:18:32.885 --> 00:18:34.425
This was one of your photos, right?

00:18:36.625 --> 00:18:37.855
I remember this.

00:18:38.625 --> 00:18:39.765
This was from the mock trial, wasn't it?

00:18:40.825 --> 00:18:42.935
Who would send this card to us?

00:18:43.735 --> 00:18:45.865
Do you have any idea who it might be?

00:18:46.765 --> 00:18:47.765
Hard to say.

00:18:49.405 --> 00:18:50.405
But...

00:18:50.835 --> 00:18:53.005
is there a particular reason you need to find the sender?

00:18:53.405 --> 00:18:56.075
It all just seems like a coincidence to me.

00:18:56.615 --> 00:18:58.445
The wine probably doesn't mean anything.

00:18:58.845 --> 00:19:01.555
And as for the photo, it was in the law school newsletter,

00:19:01.955 --> 00:19:04.385
so anyone could have found it if they really wanted to.

00:19:05.355 --> 00:19:06.355
You think so?

00:19:08.555 --> 00:19:11.595
How's everyone else doing? I see Ra Young on TV all the time.

00:19:12.425 --> 00:19:14.365
And I heard Hyun Jin got married a few years ago.

00:19:14.895 --> 00:19:16.695
Her husband's a detective, right?

00:19:17.335 --> 00:19:18.465
You're pretty up-to-date.

00:19:21.475 --> 00:19:22.475
They're all doing fine.

00:19:23.135 --> 00:19:24.135
I'll tell them you said hi.

00:19:29.615 --> 00:19:30.645
Professor.

00:19:31.215 --> 00:19:32.815
About that assignment you mentioned last time.

00:19:32.885 --> 00:19:34.045
Can we change our group members?

00:19:34.115 --> 00:19:36.284
No! I told you I can't change the groups for you!

00:19:36.285 --> 00:19:37.314
No! Go on.

00:19:37.315 --> 00:19:39.285
- Figure it out yourselves. - But, Professor...

00:19:39.355 --> 00:19:41.455
- Why do they keep telling me that? - There's someone who can verify it.

00:19:42.095 --> 00:19:43.455
He's an associate professor at Hankuk University.

00:19:43.525 --> 00:19:44.965
His name is Nam Jong Min.

00:20:31.805 --> 00:20:32.875
That's the guy.

00:20:33.305 --> 00:20:34.575
The one in the green hoodie?

00:20:38.445 --> 00:20:41.285
- What is it? - That's the same guy from my house.

00:20:44.255 --> 00:20:47.025
Then the guy in the hoodie must've messed with my car.

00:20:47.785 --> 00:20:49.225
Who on earth is he?

00:20:49.655 --> 00:20:52.465
Someone with a grudge, who's terrorizing us...

00:20:52.825 --> 00:20:55.365
and would dig up the past just to blackmail us.

00:20:58.665 --> 00:20:59.765
What if it's Connect?

00:21:00.265 --> 00:21:01.365
Connect?

00:21:01.875 --> 00:21:02.905
Think about it.

00:21:03.605 --> 00:21:06.205
This all started when we started looking into Connect.

00:21:06.745 --> 00:21:09.145
When we found out that Connect was the one who killed Reporter Lee,

00:21:09.215 --> 00:21:13.445
- they came after me. - And when you declared war on air,

00:21:13.515 --> 00:21:17.355
they started playing that card for real by going after Hyun Jin.

00:21:17.615 --> 00:21:18.785
How would Connect even know about...

00:21:19.055 --> 00:21:20.555
what happened back then?

00:21:22.225 --> 00:21:23.895
I just came from seeing Nam Jong Min.

00:21:25.225 --> 00:21:27.365
- Jong Min? - Why him?

00:21:27.795 --> 00:21:28.835
Remember that day?

00:21:29.095 --> 00:21:31.295
I told you I thought I saw a camera flash.

00:21:31.365 --> 00:21:34.065
I thought you just imagined that.

00:21:36.705 --> 00:21:38.205
If that was Jong Min,

00:21:38.845 --> 00:21:40.675
he would've told the police back then.

00:21:41.675 --> 00:21:42.915
But something's bothering you, isn't it?

00:21:43.375 --> 00:21:46.945
It's been 20 years. People change, and so do circumstances.

00:21:48.155 --> 00:21:51.555
Anyway, I asked Do Jun to look into Nam Jong Min, so let's wait.

00:21:54.955 --> 00:21:56.225
You have a visitor.

00:21:59.665 --> 00:22:00.725
Min Seo.

00:22:02.335 --> 00:22:04.665
I came to return your shoes.

00:22:05.265 --> 00:22:07.005
Are you just here for the shoes? Or...

00:22:14.045 --> 00:22:15.415
(Connect In)

00:22:18.845 --> 00:22:19.985
I have some conditions.

00:22:20.385 --> 00:22:22.885
I won't go to the police, and I won't testify in court.

00:22:22.955 --> 00:22:26.085
Don't worry about that. We won't reveal your identity.

00:22:26.285 --> 00:22:27.285
One more thing.

00:22:29.555 --> 00:22:32.725
Of all of you, I want to stay with one of you.

00:22:36.565 --> 00:22:40.865
She can stay with me at my place. I promised I'd protect her.

00:22:41.205 --> 00:22:44.735
And to be honest, I'd feel better if she was close by too.

00:22:46.205 --> 00:22:47.905
This is about Jo Yoo Jeong, isn't it?

00:22:48.175 --> 00:22:50.915
Anyway, to us, Han Min Seo...

00:22:51.215 --> 00:22:55.915
is our only way into Connect. We have to give her what she wants.

00:22:56.015 --> 00:22:58.355
If Connect really is the one attacking us,

00:22:58.985 --> 00:22:59.985
then all the more reason.

00:23:04.695 --> 00:23:08.895
- In-home personal training. - So it poses as a training app.

00:23:09.095 --> 00:23:11.065
Gosh, talk about tight security.

00:23:13.735 --> 00:23:16.935
I only see the notification window. Is this it?

00:23:17.005 --> 00:23:19.475
My app is different from the one the VIPs use.

00:23:20.005 --> 00:23:24.075
When a VIP picks and books someone, I just get notified on this app.

00:23:28.515 --> 00:23:29.585
Like this.

00:23:31.885 --> 00:23:33.425
I got this one this morning.

00:23:33.885 --> 00:23:35.595
Do you know who runs it?

00:23:37.455 --> 00:23:38.795
There are managers.

00:23:39.165 --> 00:23:42.395
They sometimes come to the location. They're the only ones I've met,

00:23:42.735 --> 00:23:45.505
- but they only reach me on the app. - How do you get paid?

00:23:45.565 --> 00:23:48.935
In cash. I get it from a dead drop. The amount varies for each job.

00:23:49.305 --> 00:23:51.845
It depends on the options the VIPs want.

00:23:54.145 --> 00:23:57.315
Options? What kind of options, specifically?

00:24:14.695 --> 00:24:15.895
Things like this.

00:24:19.035 --> 00:24:21.235
These guys are a bunch of sick scums.

00:24:28.875 --> 00:24:32.445
If you refuse... I mean, if you try to leave Connect...

00:24:32.745 --> 00:24:34.685
Then what happens?

00:24:35.315 --> 00:24:36.515
I'm about to find out.

00:24:37.255 --> 00:24:38.255
Now.

00:24:42.625 --> 00:24:45.765
I heard the three of you at the firm went to college together.

00:24:45.825 --> 00:24:50.795
I'm curious how you all decided to start a firm helping victims.

00:24:50.865 --> 00:24:54.604
We wanted victims to know we'd fight for them, not the perpetrators.

00:24:54.605 --> 00:24:56.905
We knew we had to get that message out there.

It's basically just a scheduling app.

00:26:11.815 --> 00:26:14.285
Can't you trace the server or something?

00:26:14.345 --> 00:26:16.555
You said this app's different from the one the users have, right?

00:26:17.385 --> 00:26:18.385
Yes.

00:26:18.625 --> 00:26:21.185
Then it's possible they connect to a different server altogether.

00:26:21.625 --> 00:26:24.295
If they made a separate app to avoid the risk of exposure,

00:26:24.355 --> 00:26:27.095
that means they're serious about security.

00:26:27.165 --> 00:26:29.765
So the users aren't just your average Joes.

00:26:29.835 --> 00:26:33.905
Exactly. Which means the real data probably isn't on this server.

00:26:33.965 --> 00:26:37.035
They've rerouted the connection like crazy.

00:26:37.105 --> 00:26:40.375
So what now? We can't trace their bank accounts.

00:26:40.445 --> 00:26:43.115
If we had the app for the clients, that'd be a different story.

The client app?

00:26:44.315 --> 00:26:46.685
That app's the key. The code will be different,

00:26:46.745 --> 00:26:49.855

- What about the locations? - It was mostly at hotels.

If we check the guest registration, we might find their info, right?

00:27:07.165 --> 00:27:10.375
They make reservations in our names in case they're traced.

00:27:10.635 --> 00:27:14.245
Sometimes it wasn't at a hotel. Then Connect would drive us there,

What brings you here at this hour?

00:27:57.815 --> 00:27:59.685
I left some documents behind.

00:28:07.195 --> 00:28:10.295
Americano with two spoons of milk. Your usual recipe.

00:28:11.035 --> 00:28:12.365
Not bad.

00:28:12.665 --> 00:28:15.675
You working at Haeil. I get to see you more often.

00:28:15.735 --> 00:28:17.775
That's the only perk of swinging by this place.

00:28:19.445 --> 00:28:23.515
By the way, have you met CEO Baek? What's he like?

00:28:24.645 --> 00:28:26.645
He's interesting.

00:28:27.385 --> 00:28:28.515
In a bad way?

00:28:29.215 --> 00:28:33.355
He's so famous these days. He's all over magazines and TV.

00:28:34.385 --> 00:28:36.455
I used to wonder what all the hype was about,

00:28:36.955 --> 00:28:38.225
but I think I'm starting to get it.

00:28:40.025 --> 00:28:43.165
So you have no plans to come back to this world for good?

00:28:44.235 --> 00:28:47.835
- Not a chance. - Why? You seem to be having fun.

00:28:49.175 --> 00:28:50.735
But it's not fulfilling.

00:28:51.305 --> 00:28:55.415
Even with a brilliant strategy, I don't feel better about myself.

00:28:58.915 --> 00:28:59.915
Hey, Shin Jae.

00:29:00.885 --> 00:29:04.115
The thing you mentioned last time about the foundation.

00:29:04.155 --> 00:29:05.755
Why didn't you marry my mom?

00:29:06.285 --> 00:29:07.785
I wanted a little brother or sister.

00:29:12.925 --> 00:29:14.395
Talk about coming out of left field.

00:29:15.095 --> 00:29:17.595
You come at me from every direction. How's a guy supposed to be ready?

00:29:17.995 --> 00:29:20.535
Let's not get into it today. I'm tired as it is.

00:29:21.435 --> 00:29:25.345
Please, just think it over. Until the next time we meet, okay?

00:29:37.815 --> 00:29:39.585
I just got home.

00:29:39.655 --> 00:29:42.255
Are you sure you're okay with Han Min Seo staying with you?

00:29:42.525 --> 00:29:43.955
I keep telling you I'm fine.

00:29:44.025 --> 00:29:47.765
Don't be too trusting. You barely know her.

00:29:47.825 --> 00:29:49.965
I know. Don't worry and get home safe.

00:29:51.695 --> 00:29:53.705
I've armed the security system at the front door,

00:29:53.765 --> 00:29:56.375
so if anything happens, I'll be notified immediately.

00:30:17.625 --> 00:30:18.665
Don't you have...

00:30:19.825 --> 00:30:20.825
any family?

00:30:22.695 --> 00:30:23.935
It's just me.

00:30:25.335 --> 00:30:26.965
Min Seo, you can use that room over there.

00:30:27.365 --> 00:30:30.175
My friends crash here sometimes, so there's already a bed.

00:30:31.105 --> 00:30:34.005
Let's have you take a break from your hotel job for a while.

00:30:34.205 --> 00:30:35.915
We don't know what those guys will try to pull.

00:30:37.075 --> 00:30:40.685
- Okay. - First, go ahead and unpack.

00:30:40.985 --> 00:30:42.615
Let me know if you need anything.

00:30:44.055 --> 00:30:45.055
Why...

00:30:47.985 --> 00:30:49.995
aren't you asking me to act as bait?

00:30:51.455 --> 00:30:55.435
If I just took one more job, then you guys could raid the place...

00:30:55.665 --> 00:30:57.135
or get your hands on a client's phone.

00:30:57.635 --> 00:30:59.005
That's the most surefire way to do this, isn't it?

00:31:03.175 --> 00:31:04.505
Don't you remember my promise?

00:31:04.975 --> 00:31:08.105
That I would make sure you wouldn't get hurt.

00:31:10.015 --> 00:31:13.145

So, about that DNA sample.

00:32:54.315 --> 00:32:56.385
You took care of it, right?

00:32:56.885 --> 00:32:59.585
It went through without any issues. Thank you.

00:33:00.625 --> 00:33:04.295
So what do you need me to do now? To get out of this hellhole?

00:33:05.965 --> 00:33:07.725
You need to map out that hell.

00:33:08.395 --> 00:33:10.335
Every single nook and cranny.

00:33:11.035 --> 00:33:12.065
And then what?

00:33:12.435 --> 00:33:13.635
We'll design it.

00:33:14.265 --> 00:33:16.605
A way to build an escape route out of there.

00:33:17.605 --> 00:33:18.675
I like the sound of that.

00:33:19.305 --> 00:33:21.775
I'll come see you when my map of hell is complete.

00:34:25.175 --> 00:34:28.945

00:34:36.415 --> 00:34:37.455
There. It's done.

00:34:38.185 --> 00:34:39.485
Just like you wanted.

00:34:50.795 --> 00:34:52.065
And the DNA results?

00:34:58.535 --> 00:35:00.844
Here's the cross-analysis of the DNA...

00:35:00.845 --> 00:35:02.105
Yoon Ra Young had me swap,

00:35:02.175 --> 00:35:06.445
and the suspect's bloodstain from the 2005 case.

00:35:08.485 --> 00:35:09.715
I deserve to know why.

00:35:10.215 --> 00:35:11.755
I'm your wife, after all.

00:35:13.985 --> 00:35:16.025
Why are you so obsessed with her?

00:35:22.895 --> 00:35:25.865
Don't cross the line. Just do what you're told.

00:35:26.165 --> 00:35:27.405
Keep your promise.

00:35:28.305 --> 00:35:29.935
Your promise to divorce me.

00:35:30.375 --> 00:35:33.475
Every word Yoon Ra Young says, every text she sends...

00:35:33.745 --> 00:35:35.815
Report it all to me, down to her very breath.

How did you end up working for Connect?

00:39:04.555 --> 00:39:06.055
I had a debt to pay off.

00:40:12.885 --> 00:40:14.125

00:40:22.895 --> 00:40:25.765
What is this? Are you interrogating a suspect?

00:40:26.935 --> 00:40:29.135
And if I were, would you even answer me?

00:40:29.535 --> 00:40:32.405
- Honey. - This is what you always do.

00:40:33.345 --> 00:40:35.045
All I want from you is trust,

00:40:36.045 --> 00:40:37.745

00:40:38.415 --> 00:40:41.945
No matter how much I worry or wonder about you,

00:40:42.115 --> 00:40:43.985
there's always something you're not telling me.

00:40:49.085 --> 00:40:50.455
Did I ever tell you?

00:40:51.095 --> 00:40:52.725
Why I became a cop?

00:40:53.725 --> 00:40:56.165
Back when my father had his accident,

00:40:56.795 --> 00:40:58.495
the police failed to catch who did it,

00:40:58.795 --> 00:41:00.205
so I made a decision right then and there.

00:41:00.805 --> 00:41:02.135
I knew I had to do it myself.

00:41:02.935 --> 00:41:04.905
If no one else was going to protect my family,

00:41:06.275 --> 00:41:07.605
then I'll have to be the one to do it.

00:41:13.885 --> 00:41:15.285
that man in a green hoodie...

00:41:16.155 --> 00:41:17.515
I'm definitely going to catch him.

It was the day of our club's volunteer event.

00:41:55.555 --> 00:41:58.155
We had a small get-together after the event,

00:41:58.825 --> 00:42:00.425
and at some point, Ju Hwan disappeared.

00:42:01.195 --> 00:42:03.635
We all split up to look for him.

00:42:05.095 --> 00:42:09.005
That's all I know. It's what I told the police at the time.

00:42:09.635 --> 00:42:11.405
As for what happened after that,

00:42:12.805 --> 00:42:14.305
I have absolutely no idea.

00:42:14.945 --> 00:42:16.715
I have one more question for you.

00:42:18.275 --> 00:42:21.215
Do you happen to know anything about this stamp?

00:42:26.255 --> 00:42:27.355
Let me see.

00:42:33.195 --> 00:42:36.435
This is the stamp our club used to use.

When the university transitioned to a law school system,

00:42:38.795 --> 00:42:42.265

00:42:43.135 --> 00:42:44.135
I see.

00:42:49.205 --> 00:42:50.275
Excuse me,

00:42:51.245 --> 00:42:52.915
but may I ask what this is all about?

00:42:53.015 --> 00:42:57.585
I can't discuss an active case. I hope you understand.

00:42:58.855 --> 00:42:59.925
Of course.

00:43:33.355 --> 00:43:35.755
I left this out of the report because it seemed minor, but...

00:43:40.565 --> 00:43:41.725
Professor Nam Jong Min...

00:43:42.195 --> 00:43:45.695
donates to a private organization called Sunshine since 2005.

00:43:45.995 --> 00:43:49.975
- Sunshine? - It helps sexual assault survivors.

00:44:39.685 --> 00:44:42.185
So that flash drive was real.

00:44:43.495 --> 00:44:46.425
If it's not Nam Jong Min, then who is it?

00:44:50.635 --> 00:44:53.035
You can just organize the files by case number.

00:44:53.205 --> 00:44:56.005
When you're finished, just put them in our cabinet.

00:44:56.475 --> 00:45:01.045
You can serve guests refreshments. The break room is right here.

00:45:01.575 --> 00:45:03.745
If we need any supplies, just write them down.

00:45:06.485 --> 00:45:08.845
What's that room over there?

00:45:18.925 --> 00:45:20.665
This is a space just for the three of us.

00:45:21.525 --> 00:45:25.135
We keep some of our more sensitive case files in here.

00:45:26.235 --> 00:45:28.335
So it's like a secure area.

00:45:29.935 --> 00:45:30.975
At first,

00:45:31.505 --> 00:45:32.875
it was made because of me.

00:45:33.275 --> 00:45:37.645
There are times when I need a place where I know I'm truly safe.

00:45:38.015 --> 00:45:39.845
A place where I can feel at ease.

00:45:40.215 --> 00:45:42.845
Even if I'm not physically in here, just knowing it's here helps.

00:45:45.085 --> 00:45:46.155
Attorney Yoon.

00:45:48.985 --> 00:45:52.025
- Hey! What brings you here? - It's been a while.

00:45:52.625 --> 00:45:54.625
So, is everyone managing to stay off the cigarettes?

00:45:55.365 --> 00:45:56.865
These have to be better for you than nicotine.

00:45:59.395 --> 00:46:02.065
But you can't have these unless you line up before opening.

00:46:02.435 --> 00:46:04.135
I've tried and failed twice!

00:46:05.235 --> 00:46:07.005
Oh, gosh.

00:46:07.445 --> 00:46:09.875
- Should I get on my knees and bow? - Come on. Don't be dramatic.

00:46:10.915 --> 00:46:12.575
Shin Jae, can I talk to you for a minute?

00:46:13.045 --> 00:46:14.645
Sure. Let's go to that room.

00:46:14.985 --> 00:46:16.984
Ra Young, could you tell them to serve us two teas?

00:46:16.985 --> 00:46:18.085
Sure.

00:46:19.015 --> 00:46:20.825
- This way. - Look at this.

00:46:22.655 --> 00:46:24.895
What was it you said to me last time?

00:46:26.395 --> 00:46:29.425
Something about why I never married your mother?

00:46:31.965 --> 00:46:33.405
I've always wondered about that.

00:46:35.205 --> 00:46:36.205
Because...

00:46:36.635 --> 00:46:39.475
your mother and I never had that kind of relationship.

00:46:39.575 --> 00:46:41.945
Really? After all this time?

00:46:42.345 --> 00:46:43.475
Not even once.

00:46:45.215 --> 00:46:49.445
But your mother was always the greatest partner I ever had.

00:46:49.885 --> 00:46:53.685
CEO Seong and I have always been on the same page.

00:46:55.925 --> 00:46:59.525
So you're rejecting my proposal, then.

00:47:01.095 --> 00:47:02.725
But just this one time,

00:47:03.095 --> 00:47:05.395
I'm going to paint a different picture than CEO Seong.

They're the current backbone of Haeil.

00:47:27.785 --> 00:47:29.925
If every single one of us leaves Haeil at once...

00:47:29.995 --> 00:47:31.425
Haeil would be crippled.

00:47:32.125 --> 00:47:35.565
Its collected data and connections. That's the source of Haeil's power.

00:47:36.595 --> 00:47:40.205
We'll use this as leverage on CEO Seong's succession plan.

00:47:40.265 --> 00:47:44.375
Once the successor spot is vacant, incorporation will be inevitable.

- will create a public foundation. - Then, the new head of Haeil...

will be you.
