{\an8}ADAPTED FROM A SHUQI.COM NOVEL
ORIGINAL AUTHOR: SENLIN LU

00:01:34.705 --> 00:01:35.625
Physician Luo!

00:01:36.505 --> 00:01:37.345
It's Physician Luo.

00:01:46.505 --> 00:01:48.545
ALL HAIL WHITE ASURA

00:01:51.745 --> 00:01:54.825
No obvious wounds on Physician Luo's body.

00:01:55.465 --> 00:01:57.465
He likely didn't get
into a fight before he died.

00:02:04.345 --> 00:02:06.825
On his left side,
there are leaves and mud.

00:02:07.505 --> 00:02:09.545
Fresh scrapes on his left palm.

00:02:13.425 --> 00:02:15.265
Drag marks on his back.

00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:18.185
He likely fell first,
then was dragged here.

00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:25.305
Physician Luo likely fell here.

00:02:28.625 --> 00:02:30.425
Judging by the tracks,

00:02:30.505 --> 00:02:33.025
his heels dug into the ground,
with scuff marks as well.

00:02:33.545 --> 00:02:34.585
The killer isn't very strong.

00:02:34.665 --> 00:02:37.625
They were facing the corridor,
dragging the body here with effort.

00:02:38.225 --> 00:02:41.265
Your Ladyship, can you tell
when Physician Luo died?

00:02:44.425 --> 00:02:45.745
From the rigor mortis,

00:02:45.825 --> 00:02:47.985
he hasn't been dead long, about two ke.

00:02:48.065 --> 00:02:52.465
Why did they drag the body
all the way here?

00:02:59.985 --> 00:03:01.465
About two ke ago,

00:03:01.545 --> 00:03:03.345
the line between light
and shadow was right here.

00:03:03.425 --> 00:03:05.745
Half his face was lit, half was dark.

00:03:15.345 --> 00:03:17.985
His tongue is purple,
with bruises on the sides.

00:03:18.505 --> 00:03:19.545
Poisoned again?

00:03:23.225 --> 00:03:25.225
You're the Medical Supervisor. Go on.

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:29.265
A purple tongue and bruising
doesn't always mean poison.

00:03:29.865 --> 00:03:30.945
It could be a heart attack.

00:03:31.585 --> 00:03:32.825
Look.

00:03:32.905 --> 00:03:36.145
His nails are purple,
and his lips are dark.

00:03:36.225 --> 00:03:39.105
These are all signs of a heart attack.

00:03:39.185 --> 00:03:41.465
It may be that his heart acted up,

00:03:41.545 --> 00:03:44.945
so he fell and scraped his palm.

00:03:45.865 --> 00:03:46.705
A heart attack?

00:03:48.105 --> 00:03:50.385
Physician Luo often had chest pains.

00:03:50.985 --> 00:03:53.305
I even prescribed him
Blood-Activating Pills.

00:03:57.985 --> 00:03:59.105
Your Ladyship.

00:04:05.665 --> 00:04:07.185
Did he mention White Asura?

00:04:13.065 --> 00:04:14.185
We still haven't found the one

00:04:14.265 --> 00:04:16.905
who helped Pan Yongqi
light the pine strip.

00:04:16.985 --> 00:04:19.865
But all the signs point
to him choosing death.

00:04:20.705 --> 00:04:22.825
The ginseng seeds came from Luo Zhian,

00:04:23.865 --> 00:04:25.705
yet he dies at a time like this.

00:04:26.625 --> 00:04:30.065
So you mean
Luo Zhian's death wasn't an accident?

00:04:31.065 --> 00:04:33.385
A heart attack
is hard to cause from the outside.

00:04:33.985 --> 00:04:36.385
In both their mouths
was an "All hail White Asura" talisman.

00:04:37.145 --> 00:04:39.065
Their deaths can't be that simple.

00:04:39.145 --> 00:04:43.145
Who could have moved Physician Luo's body?

00:04:49.225 --> 00:04:50.265
This way.

00:04:51.545 --> 00:04:52.465
Your Ladyship,

00:04:53.265 --> 00:04:55.065
Physician Luo's desk is here.

00:05:01.305 --> 00:05:03.265
- What's this?
- Just a basic safety charm.

00:05:04.345 --> 00:05:06.745
Did Physician Luo
secretly worship White Asura?

00:05:07.345 --> 00:05:08.665
The whole palace
is buzzing about White Asura.

00:05:08.745 --> 00:05:09.865
I've heard the rumors too.

00:05:10.745 --> 00:05:12.145
Even you're curious about that?

00:05:13.385 --> 00:05:15.185
Talk of the supernatural is improper.

00:05:17.105 --> 00:05:18.505
Physician Luo has a student.

00:05:19.305 --> 00:05:21.585
She knows his affairs better than anyone.

00:05:21.665 --> 00:05:22.785
I'll go fetch her for you.

00:05:28.625 --> 00:05:30.665
Medical Officer Zhao Yudi
greets Your Ladyship.

00:05:37.705 --> 00:05:39.345
YU JIAN ER APOTROPAIC TALISMAN

00:05:40.025 --> 00:05:41.305
So my master

00:05:41.385 --> 00:05:43.305
didn't keep this warding charm
on him after all.

00:05:44.665 --> 00:05:45.585
What happened?

00:05:49.225 --> 00:05:52.105
The one who killed him wasn't human.

00:05:52.905 --> 00:05:53.745
It was a ghost.

00:05:54.425 --> 00:05:55.265
A ghost?

00:05:56.305 --> 00:05:58.705
On the Yin-Yang Road,
a female ghost walks at night.

00:06:05.225 --> 00:06:06.625
Do you believe in ghosts, Your Ladyship?

00:06:06.705 --> 00:06:08.345
I never believe in ghosts or deities.

00:06:09.985 --> 00:06:11.945
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,

00:06:12.025 --> 00:06:14.025
I'd have called it nonsense too.

00:06:21.745 --> 00:06:24.665
A month ago,
Lady Su fell gravely ill late at night.

00:06:24.745 --> 00:06:25.825
My master and I went to treat her.

00:06:25.905 --> 00:06:28.505
Not until the Hai Hour
did she finally sleep in peace.

00:06:28.585 --> 00:06:30.465
Normally, my master and I

00:06:30.545 --> 00:06:32.025
take the main road
back to the Medical Office.

00:06:32.105 --> 00:06:33.785
But that night, for some reason,

00:06:34.345 --> 00:06:37.305
my master insisted on taking
this lonely Yin-Yang Road.

00:06:39.185 --> 00:06:42.585
Master, let's take the main road.

00:06:42.665 --> 00:06:44.105
This road is truly frightening.

00:06:45.625 --> 00:06:47.185
"The wise do not speak
of the supernatural,

00:06:47.705 --> 00:06:49.905
not because they deny their existence,
but to keep a respectful distance."

00:06:49.985 --> 00:06:53.305
If there are ghosts,
then there must be immortals too.

00:06:53.385 --> 00:06:54.945
Our conscience is clear.

00:06:55.025 --> 00:06:56.065
What is there to fear?

00:07:03.225 --> 00:07:04.265
Who goes there?

00:07:08.665 --> 00:07:10.665
Master! You saw it too?

00:07:10.745 --> 00:07:11.785
Who are you?

00:07:11.865 --> 00:07:13.665
Why linger here at night?

00:07:17.385 --> 00:07:18.305
Am I beautiful?

00:07:22.905 --> 00:07:23.625
Medical Supervisor…

00:07:25.665 --> 00:07:26.985
Is it really you?

00:07:27.705 --> 00:07:29.265
- Medical Supervisor!
- Let go of me!

00:07:29.345 --> 00:07:30.665
- Let go of me! Let go!
- Save me!

00:07:30.745 --> 00:07:32.825
- Medical Supervisor! Medical Supervisor!
- Let go!

00:07:32.905 --> 00:07:33.785
Run!

00:07:33.865 --> 00:07:34.905
- Help me!
- Let go!

00:07:34.985 --> 00:07:36.185
- Run!
- Look at me!

00:07:36.265 --> 00:07:39.145
Medical Supervisor, help me!

00:07:39.225 --> 00:07:41.065
Medical Supervisor!

00:07:42.065 --> 00:07:44.745
Master! Someone, help!

00:07:44.825 --> 00:07:45.905
Someone!

00:07:45.985 --> 00:07:47.905
Help! Murder!

00:07:50.665 --> 00:07:51.705
Master!

00:08:05.225 --> 00:08:07.065
I saw with my own eyes

00:08:07.145 --> 00:08:08.545
that the female ghost
vanished into the painting.

00:08:08.625 --> 00:08:10.785
I've seen plenty of people die of illness,

00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:13.225
but seeing a ghost,
that was my first time.

00:08:13.305 --> 00:08:14.225
They knew each other?

00:08:14.305 --> 00:08:15.465
I'm not sure,

00:08:15.545 --> 00:08:18.105
but that female ghost
kept calling him "Medical Supervisor."

00:08:18.185 --> 00:08:20.465
My master was terrified
and had a heart attack on the spot.

00:08:20.545 --> 00:08:22.385
Did you ever see that female ghost again?

00:08:23.145 --> 00:08:24.665
I wanted to go back and look,

00:08:24.745 --> 00:08:26.945
but my master forbade it.

00:08:27.025 --> 00:08:28.745
Why add to his worries?

00:08:28.825 --> 00:08:30.545
I even went out of my way
to get him a safety charm.

00:08:30.625 --> 00:08:34.105
But why wouldn't he carry it?

00:08:34.625 --> 00:08:35.505
And besides,

00:08:35.585 --> 00:08:37.505
why did he go back to this road?

00:08:42.705 --> 00:08:43.865
Thank you.

00:08:43.945 --> 00:08:47.665
If anything else comes back to you,
come find me anytime.

00:08:52.265 --> 00:08:53.825
Your Ladyship,

00:08:53.905 --> 00:08:55.745
you probably don't remember me.

00:08:55.825 --> 00:08:58.385
I once lived with Pei Yu.

00:08:59.865 --> 00:09:00.705
It's you.

00:09:00.785 --> 00:09:02.985
If not for your suggestion to His Majesty,

00:09:03.065 --> 00:09:04.265
at the Medical Office,

00:09:04.345 --> 00:09:07.665
I'd probably still
be someone they could order around.

00:09:07.745 --> 00:09:09.065
But now,

00:09:09.145 --> 00:09:11.465
I can make house calls on my own
and write prescriptions.

00:09:12.625 --> 00:09:13.705
Congratulations.

00:09:15.225 --> 00:09:16.145
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

00:09:16.745 --> 00:09:18.025
Thank yourself.

00:09:18.105 --> 00:09:19.265
And thank Pei Yu.

00:09:43.065 --> 00:09:44.105
It was her?

00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:24.785
Am I beautiful?

00:10:28.585 --> 00:10:31.745
Talent Dong, you are stunning.

00:10:31.825 --> 00:10:33.705
TALENT DONG

00:10:33.785 --> 00:10:34.985
Talent Dong?

00:10:35.505 --> 00:10:36.505
What…

00:10:37.985 --> 00:10:39.025
What did you call me?

00:10:39.625 --> 00:10:40.785
Talent Dong.

00:10:41.785 --> 00:10:43.065
Talent Dong…

00:10:52.825 --> 00:10:55.745
Supervisor Luo, you're back.

00:10:55.825 --> 00:10:57.585
Supervisor Luo, you're back!

00:10:57.665 --> 00:10:59.505
Supervisor Luo, you're back!

00:10:59.585 --> 00:11:00.745
You're back!

00:11:00.825 --> 00:11:03.345
Supervisor Luo! Supervisor Luo, save me!

00:11:03.425 --> 00:11:05.425
Save me! Save me!

00:11:05.505 --> 00:11:06.745
Supervisor Luo!

00:11:06.825 --> 00:11:08.065
Supervisor Luo!

00:11:08.145 --> 00:11:10.385
You came…
You finally came, Supervisor Luo!

00:11:10.465 --> 00:11:11.585
- Save me!
- My lady!

00:11:11.665 --> 00:11:12.945
- Supervisor Luo!
- My lady!

00:11:16.825 --> 00:11:18.105
Supervisor Luo!

00:11:18.185 --> 00:11:19.265
- My lady!
- Supervisor Luo…

00:11:21.145 --> 00:11:23.705
My lady isn't a ghost.
Please clear her name, Your Ladyship.

00:11:52.905 --> 00:11:54.705
Talent Dong loves looking pretty.

00:11:57.545 --> 00:11:58.385
She uses silkworm powder.

00:11:59.745 --> 00:12:01.825
Those consorts use it
to brighten the skin.

00:12:08.905 --> 00:12:10.345
My lady's ill

00:12:10.425 --> 00:12:12.545
and offended Your Ladyship
and Deputy Director.

00:12:12.625 --> 00:12:14.265
Please don't blame her.

00:12:14.345 --> 00:12:15.185
No harm done.

00:12:16.145 --> 00:12:19.945
Talent Dong once had the spotlight
and His Majesty's full favor.

00:12:20.025 --> 00:12:21.145
How did she end up like this?

00:12:21.225 --> 00:12:22.065
DIANJIANG, PALACE MAID

00:12:22.145 --> 00:12:24.825
I started to serve Talent Dong
a few years ago.

00:12:24.905 --> 00:12:25.865
As for what happened before,

00:12:25.945 --> 00:12:28.625
I only heard it from Zhanqing,
who stayed by my lady's side.

00:12:29.225 --> 00:12:31.345
When my lady first entered
the palace ten years ago,

00:12:31.425 --> 00:12:34.065
she could see up close, not far away,

00:12:34.145 --> 00:12:36.865
so she always had to squint
to make out things in the distance.

00:12:36.945 --> 00:12:38.265
My lady, look!

00:12:38.345 --> 00:12:39.025
ZHANQING, PALACE MAID

00:12:39.105 --> 00:12:40.345
That's a peacock!

00:12:40.425 --> 00:12:41.945
It's so pretty.

00:12:43.785 --> 00:12:46.105
She was always troubled
by her poor eyesight,

00:12:46.185 --> 00:12:49.425
unaware that squinting and frowning
gave her a tender, affectionate look.

00:12:50.425 --> 00:12:53.105
So, she won His Majesty's favor.

00:12:53.625 --> 00:12:56.185
But word is, it didn't last long

00:12:56.265 --> 00:12:59.505
before His Majesty
became taken with another, Zhao Baolin.

00:12:59.585 --> 00:13:01.985
Zhao Baolin was likely
cast aside soon as well?

00:13:02.065 --> 00:13:05.465
There are countless beauties in
the palace, each blooming in her own way.

00:13:05.545 --> 00:13:07.825
Even the trends keep changing.

00:13:08.425 --> 00:13:09.985
Today it's high noses and deep-set eyes.

00:13:10.065 --> 00:13:12.505
Tomorrow, they praise
full-figured, gentle ladies.

00:13:13.265 --> 00:13:15.425
The day after,
it's delicate and boneless that's in.

00:13:16.025 --> 00:13:17.425
Those who fall out of favor

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:21.305
can only cling to a sliver of hope,
copying the favored consort's makeup.

00:13:21.905 --> 00:13:23.585
But Talent Dong was proud and arrogant.

00:13:23.665 --> 00:13:25.345
She likely scorned imitating others.

00:13:25.425 --> 00:13:27.825
My lady wanted to be one of a kind.

00:13:27.905 --> 00:13:31.105
Zhanqing said my lady soon found a way.

00:13:31.185 --> 00:13:33.705
She asked Physician Luo for Radiant Toxin.

00:13:33.785 --> 00:13:34.985
Radiant Toxin?

00:13:35.745 --> 00:13:37.585
How does this life-destroying drug
defies all bans?

00:13:38.185 --> 00:13:39.185
Radiant Toxin

00:13:39.265 --> 00:13:41.665
can make the skin ghostly pale,
smooth as silk.

00:13:41.745 --> 00:13:45.185
But if you take it long-term,
it can cloud the mind.

00:13:45.265 --> 00:13:47.985
To win His Majesty's favor,
my lady took the risk

00:13:48.065 --> 00:13:49.945
and had Physician Luo
mix it for her in secret.

00:13:50.545 --> 00:13:52.425
Luckily, it truly worked.

00:13:53.185 --> 00:13:56.025
My lady put on flowing dance robes
and danced for His Majesty.

00:13:56.105 --> 00:13:57.345
Her skin was white as snow,

00:13:57.945 --> 00:13:59.065
radiant and dazzling.

00:13:59.985 --> 00:14:03.105
His Majesty stayed
in my lady's place that very night.

00:14:10.905 --> 00:14:14.185
I'd long heard Luo Zhian
rose fast in the Medical Office

00:14:14.265 --> 00:14:17.025
thanks to the favor of a beloved consort.

00:14:17.105 --> 00:14:18.225
So it was Talent Dong.

00:14:20.185 --> 00:14:23.545
Physician Luo climbed the ranks,
and my lady regained His Majesty's favor.

00:14:24.145 --> 00:14:26.865
For a long while,
she stayed by His Majesty's side.

00:14:32.385 --> 00:14:34.385
That "Butterflies Court a Beauty"
painting in the corridor

00:14:34.465 --> 00:14:35.665
was made during that time.

00:14:37.945 --> 00:14:40.785
However, no flower blooms forever.

00:14:41.665 --> 00:14:42.705
One autumn hunt,

00:14:42.785 --> 00:14:44.105
His Majesty had a whim

00:14:44.185 --> 00:14:45.985
to break the rules
and bring a few consorts along.

00:14:46.065 --> 00:14:49.225
But because my lady couldn't see far,
she wasn't allowed to go.

00:14:49.305 --> 00:14:51.145
She went to His Majesty, making a scene,

00:14:51.225 --> 00:14:52.825
and only angered him.

00:14:52.905 --> 00:14:54.825
His Majesty began to despise my lady,

00:14:54.905 --> 00:14:57.865
saying her eyes looked dull from afar.

00:14:57.945 --> 00:14:59.265
He sent her back.

00:14:59.345 --> 00:15:00.785
Useless…

00:15:01.585 --> 00:15:03.625
Useless! All of you!

00:15:05.825 --> 00:15:07.425
If you can't fix my eyes,

00:15:07.505 --> 00:15:09.785
don't even think
about staying in the Medical Office!

00:15:10.425 --> 00:15:11.425
Spare me, my lady!

00:15:12.025 --> 00:15:14.585
I have searched the medical texts.

00:15:14.665 --> 00:15:16.185
This near-sighted condition

00:15:16.265 --> 00:15:18.105
can only be eased in childhood.

00:15:18.185 --> 00:15:20.825
Once grown, it's hard to cure.

00:15:23.825 --> 00:15:25.345
Hard to cure?

00:15:28.265 --> 00:15:29.785
Supervisor Luo,

00:15:29.865 --> 00:15:32.065
only you can save me.

00:15:33.305 --> 00:15:34.745
Please, save me.

00:15:39.345 --> 00:15:41.225
If I have to spend the days ahead

00:15:42.225 --> 00:15:44.305
alone in this palace,

00:15:46.705 --> 00:15:47.705
then…

00:15:48.985 --> 00:15:50.225
I'd rather die.

00:15:50.305 --> 00:15:51.745
My lady!

00:15:51.825 --> 00:15:53.105
- Let me die!
- My lady!

00:15:53.185 --> 00:15:54.105
My lady!

00:15:56.145 --> 00:15:57.185
My lady!

00:15:58.265 --> 00:16:00.545
- Let me die…
- My lady…

00:16:02.985 --> 00:16:03.825
I…

00:16:05.185 --> 00:16:06.785
have seen in medical books

00:16:07.385 --> 00:16:09.945
that needling can treat this condition.

00:16:11.065 --> 00:16:13.985
But those who recover
are few and far between.

00:16:16.585 --> 00:16:18.065
So it can be done.

00:16:18.985 --> 00:16:19.945
Supervisor Luo,

00:16:21.025 --> 00:16:22.665
I beg you to treat me.

00:16:25.105 --> 00:16:28.625
But a single misstep
could cost you your sight.

00:16:29.145 --> 00:16:31.545
Supervisor Luo, I trust you!

00:16:34.185 --> 00:16:35.465
Please…

00:16:36.185 --> 00:16:37.745
use the needles and cure me.

00:16:40.025 --> 00:16:42.265
So, her eyes were ruined by Physician Luo?

00:16:42.905 --> 00:16:44.105
Zhanqing said

00:16:44.185 --> 00:16:46.425
after several treatments,
it did help a little.

00:16:46.505 --> 00:16:48.305
Talent Dong was overjoyed.

00:16:49.065 --> 00:16:51.025
But later,
the southern epidemic broke out,

00:16:51.105 --> 00:16:52.545
and the Medical Office sent help.

00:16:52.625 --> 00:16:55.065
When Physician Luo
was about to leave for months,

00:16:55.145 --> 00:16:57.545
my lady had him needle her more often.

00:16:57.625 --> 00:16:58.825
But…

00:16:58.905 --> 00:17:00.905
the day after Physician Luo left,

00:17:01.505 --> 00:17:03.145
my lady found
she couldn't see from her left eye.

00:17:03.865 --> 00:17:05.464
Was it due to his needling?

00:17:06.105 --> 00:17:07.704
Zhanqing told me

00:17:07.785 --> 00:17:09.905
Physician Luo
had long wanted to shake her off,

00:17:09.985 --> 00:17:12.105
so his technique
was always too aggressive.

00:17:12.745 --> 00:17:14.825
If he helped contain
the southern epidemic,

00:17:14.905 --> 00:17:16.745
he'd win His Majesty's favor.

00:17:17.385 --> 00:17:19.545
Physician Luo
no longer needed Talent Dong.

00:17:20.145 --> 00:17:23.625
If she'd been treated in time,
it shouldn't have come to this.

00:17:24.224 --> 00:17:27.505
No one at the Medical Office knew
he'd been needling my lady.

00:17:28.265 --> 00:17:29.945
So when they came,

00:17:30.025 --> 00:17:32.105
Zhanqing didn't dare tell the truth.

00:17:32.185 --> 00:17:35.465
Maybe they missed the cause,
and my lady's left eye worsened.

00:17:35.545 --> 00:17:38.625
Finally, that eye went completely blind.

00:17:39.945 --> 00:17:41.225
- My lady!
- Am I beautiful?

00:17:41.825 --> 00:17:42.985
- Where is His Majesty?
- My lady!

00:17:43.065 --> 00:17:44.265
Am I beautiful?

00:17:45.865 --> 00:17:47.185
Am I beautiful?

00:17:47.265 --> 00:17:48.105
- My lady!
- My lady!

00:17:48.185 --> 00:17:49.305
Am I beautiful?

00:17:49.385 --> 00:17:51.265
His Majesty is coming
to watch me dance tonight.

00:17:51.345 --> 00:17:53.145
UNVEILED LUMINESCENCE

00:17:55.585 --> 00:17:57.425
After Talent Dong lost her left eye,

00:17:57.505 --> 00:17:59.345
she could no longer win
His Majesty's favor?

00:17:59.425 --> 00:18:00.825
After that,

00:18:00.905 --> 00:18:02.265
my lady suffered a great shock.

00:18:02.345 --> 00:18:04.825
But she still clung
to His Majesty's past kindness.

00:18:04.905 --> 00:18:06.225
She snuck off to see him.

00:18:06.305 --> 00:18:08.625
And her blind left eye
startled His Majesty.

00:18:08.705 --> 00:18:12.385
So, she was locked up
in the most remote Qinghui Palace.

00:18:12.465 --> 00:18:15.345
For over ten years,
she never saw His Majesty again.

00:18:15.425 --> 00:18:17.945
Later, I was assigned here,

00:18:18.025 --> 00:18:19.665
and I've been with my lady
for two years now.

00:18:20.265 --> 00:18:21.505
You just let her carry on like this?

00:18:21.585 --> 00:18:24.305
But she's still beautiful, isn't she?

00:18:24.385 --> 00:18:26.305
In the first few years,

00:18:26.385 --> 00:18:28.545
there were times
when my lady was clear-headed.

00:18:29.145 --> 00:18:31.665
But when she was,
seeing what she'd become,

00:18:31.745 --> 00:18:34.185
it only deepened her misery,
making her long for death.

00:18:34.785 --> 00:18:35.945
Now,

00:18:36.025 --> 00:18:37.345
though she's mad,

00:18:37.425 --> 00:18:39.185
it's like she lives inside her own dream.

00:18:39.785 --> 00:18:41.545
She likes that corridor,

00:18:41.625 --> 00:18:43.425
because of the painting there.

00:18:44.025 --> 00:18:47.145
In that painting,
she's still the one His Majesty adored.

00:18:48.465 --> 00:18:49.505
Zhanqing.

00:18:49.585 --> 00:18:50.705
My lady.

00:18:52.385 --> 00:18:54.025
Is His Majesty coming tonight?

00:18:55.745 --> 00:18:57.385
His Majesty says you should rest early.

00:18:57.465 --> 00:18:59.265
No need to wait.

00:18:59.345 --> 00:19:01.665
He'll come tomorrow. Tomorrow for sure.

00:19:02.465 --> 00:19:04.465
- Really?
- Really.

00:19:04.545 --> 00:19:06.025
His Majesty is coming tomorrow?

00:19:07.265 --> 00:19:09.385
Then dress me up, pretty and proper.

00:19:10.185 --> 00:19:12.905
My lady looks lovely, no matter what.

00:19:15.265 --> 00:19:16.585
His Majesty is coming tomorrow!

00:19:17.105 --> 00:19:18.985
His Majesty is coming tomorrow!

00:19:21.825 --> 00:19:23.345
When Talent Dong
went to that Yin-Yang Road,

00:19:23.425 --> 00:19:24.425
did she wear an outer cloak?

00:19:24.505 --> 00:19:25.625
Yes.

00:19:25.705 --> 00:19:27.305
A black outer cloak.

00:19:28.065 --> 00:19:29.105
So,

00:19:29.185 --> 00:19:31.425
she hid in the shadows
wearing that black cloak.

00:19:31.505 --> 00:19:33.705
Then she took it off,
showing the white gauze dress,

00:19:33.785 --> 00:19:35.545
like she stepped out of the wall.

00:19:35.625 --> 00:19:37.185
And when she left,

00:19:37.265 --> 00:19:38.665
she put the black cloak back on,

00:19:38.745 --> 00:19:40.665
like she walked into the wall.

00:19:42.545 --> 00:19:44.825
My lady is no longer
as beautiful as she was.

00:19:45.425 --> 00:19:48.225
Staring at that painting
is just clinging to what once was.

00:19:48.865 --> 00:19:50.385
I came up with this trick

00:19:50.465 --> 00:19:53.265
only because I didn't want anyone
to disturb her there.

00:19:54.145 --> 00:19:56.905
I never thought
it would spark rumors of a female ghost.

00:19:56.985 --> 00:19:58.665
It backfired on you.

00:19:59.905 --> 00:20:01.385
Caring for her must be exhausting.

00:20:02.265 --> 00:20:04.585
Did she scratch your hand?

00:20:04.665 --> 00:20:07.505
Taking care of my lady
is what I should do.

00:20:08.105 --> 00:20:10.185
Back then, when Physician Luo
returned from the south,

00:20:10.265 --> 00:20:11.785
he didn't learn
what happened to Talent Dong?

00:20:12.585 --> 00:20:13.425
I don't know.

00:20:13.505 --> 00:20:15.145
He never even came to ask?

00:20:15.225 --> 00:20:17.505
Talent Dong lost her left eye,
her looks were ruined,

00:20:17.585 --> 00:20:18.745
all because of Luo Zhian.

00:20:18.825 --> 00:20:20.585
She had every reason
to hate him to the core.

00:20:20.665 --> 00:20:23.705
After that, did they ever meet again?

00:20:24.425 --> 00:20:25.585
My lady hates him.

00:20:25.665 --> 00:20:28.225
None of us wanted
her going back to that corridor.

00:20:28.305 --> 00:20:30.665
But my lady
definitely didn't kill Physician Luo.

00:20:30.745 --> 00:20:32.825
Then last night, where was she?

00:20:33.985 --> 00:20:35.465
Ever since my lady
recognized Physician Luo,

00:20:36.145 --> 00:20:37.385
she couldn't let it go.

00:20:37.465 --> 00:20:40.025
She kept saying she'd get revenge
and demand her eye back.

00:20:40.825 --> 00:20:42.225
I lived on edge every day.

00:20:42.305 --> 00:20:44.225
I fed her pills early
and coaxed her to sleep.

00:20:44.905 --> 00:20:46.865
But last night, she still ran out.

00:20:47.785 --> 00:20:50.745
The moment I saw she was gone,
I ran after her.

00:20:54.145 --> 00:20:55.505
My lady!

00:20:58.065 --> 00:20:59.185
My lady…

00:21:02.865 --> 00:21:04.865
Seeing Physician Luo utterly still,

00:21:05.385 --> 00:21:06.625
I went closer to check.

00:21:09.945 --> 00:21:12.305
I found he wasn't even breathing.

00:21:12.905 --> 00:21:15.425
I was afraid my lady would be frightened,
so I tried to get her out of there fast.

00:21:16.465 --> 00:21:18.865
But when she realized he was dead,

00:21:18.945 --> 00:21:19.865
she insisted on dragging him

00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:21.625
to the line between light
and shadow in the corridor.

00:21:22.305 --> 00:21:24.905
He made her what she is now,
neither human nor ghost.

00:21:25.505 --> 00:21:28.785
So she wanted him to never rest in peace.

00:21:28.865 --> 00:21:32.025
When Physician Luo fell,
Talent Dong never touched him?

00:21:34.065 --> 00:21:35.665
My lady tried to go closer,

00:21:35.745 --> 00:21:37.825
but I held her back.
I didn't let her near him.

00:21:38.425 --> 00:21:41.105
When Talent Dong dragged Physician Luo,

00:21:41.185 --> 00:21:44.425
did she take anything from his body
or leave anything behind?

00:21:49.025 --> 00:21:50.385
Talent Dong is pitiable too.

00:21:50.465 --> 00:21:53.065
To win favor, she'd do anything.

00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:55.185
Otherwise she wouldn't
have ended up like this.

00:21:55.265 --> 00:21:59.105
For consorts, the greatest wish
is His Majesty's favor.

00:21:59.185 --> 00:22:02.545
Without it, they might as well
be in the Cold Palace.

00:22:05.465 --> 00:22:08.185
Mr. Xiao, what are you thinking?

00:22:10.145 --> 00:22:11.625
Something still feels off.

00:22:11.705 --> 00:22:13.745
If the heart attack was an accident,

00:22:13.825 --> 00:22:16.025
then the timing of his collapse
is far too perfect.

00:22:17.425 --> 00:22:20.385
Accident or not,
someone will answer that for us.

00:22:28.265 --> 00:22:29.585
From the tongue and limbs,

00:22:29.665 --> 00:22:30.985
it does look like a heart attack.

00:22:32.145 --> 00:22:33.305
If he had this condition,

00:22:33.385 --> 00:22:35.505
then normally,
he'd carry pills with him, right?

00:22:36.505 --> 00:22:37.345
Yes.

00:22:37.425 --> 00:22:39.105
He kept a bottle of Heart-Soothing Pills
on him at all times.

00:22:39.185 --> 00:22:41.665
Every few days,
I'd replace them with fresh ones.

00:22:41.745 --> 00:22:43.305
And after my master had a few episodes,

00:22:43.385 --> 00:22:44.705
I became even more careful.

00:22:44.785 --> 00:22:46.945
The pill bottle was in his sleeve pocket,

00:22:47.025 --> 00:22:47.865
easy to reach.

00:22:48.905 --> 00:22:50.145
We checked during the autopsy,

00:22:50.225 --> 00:22:51.105
but it wasn't there.

00:22:51.185 --> 00:22:52.225
How could that be?

00:22:53.385 --> 00:22:55.345
Medical Officer Zhao, in your view,

00:22:55.425 --> 00:22:57.625
could Physician Luo have killed himself?

00:22:57.705 --> 00:22:58.825
Suicide?

00:23:04.185 --> 00:23:05.105
What are you looking for?

00:23:05.705 --> 00:23:06.625
Needle marks.

00:23:07.185 --> 00:23:08.705
If my master took his own life,

00:23:08.785 --> 00:23:10.225
he'd needle himself first

00:23:10.305 --> 00:23:13.745
to slow his qi and blood
and trigger a heart attack.

00:23:17.265 --> 00:23:18.345
Danzhong.

00:23:20.585 --> 00:23:21.665
Neiguan.

00:23:24.585 --> 00:23:25.465
Quze.

00:23:26.465 --> 00:23:27.265
That's right.

00:23:27.345 --> 00:23:30.345
This special needling technique
is known only to my master.

00:23:30.425 --> 00:23:31.705
It throws the qi and blood off course.

00:23:31.785 --> 00:23:34.785
After needling himself,
he triggered the attack.

00:23:35.305 --> 00:23:36.345
But he was set on dying,

00:23:36.425 --> 00:23:38.225
so he deliberately didn't keep
his pills on him.

00:23:39.745 --> 00:23:40.585
It was suicide.

00:23:43.065 --> 00:23:44.985
But why would he kill himself?

00:23:45.505 --> 00:23:46.705
Why do you say that?

00:23:47.865 --> 00:23:50.585
Lately, my master
has been favored by Consort Shu,

00:23:50.665 --> 00:23:51.505
and in the limelight.

00:23:51.585 --> 00:23:55.265
Everyone at the Medical Office thinks
he'll be promoted to Imperial Physician.

00:23:55.345 --> 00:23:56.505
He's been waiting for it.

00:23:56.585 --> 00:23:58.065
Why kill himself now?

00:23:58.905 --> 00:24:02.105
Wasn't it always Physician Liu
who treated Consort Shu?

00:24:02.185 --> 00:24:05.425
I don't know how
Physician Liu offended her.

00:24:05.505 --> 00:24:07.785
A month ago, she stopped summoning him.

00:24:10.145 --> 00:24:12.385
Maybe White Asura helped.

00:24:12.465 --> 00:24:15.025
Did Physician Luo
ever mention Talent Dong?

00:24:15.105 --> 00:24:16.305
Talent Dong?

00:24:17.705 --> 00:24:20.585
The "ghost" you met on the Yin-Yang Road.

00:24:22.825 --> 00:24:24.865
My master never again
brought up what happened that night.

00:24:27.785 --> 00:24:28.945
Thanks for your hard work.

00:24:29.025 --> 00:24:30.745
It's late. Please go back.

00:24:34.265 --> 00:24:35.385
Your Ladyship,

00:24:36.345 --> 00:24:38.105
if you ever need another autopsy,

00:24:38.185 --> 00:24:40.225
I will be at your service.

00:24:48.265 --> 00:24:49.385
Could Physician Luo

00:24:49.465 --> 00:24:51.425
have grown a conscience
after meeting Talent Dong

00:24:51.505 --> 00:24:52.585
and killed himself to atone?

00:24:54.065 --> 00:24:56.025
Physician Luo only ever wanted
to climb the ladder.

00:24:56.545 --> 00:24:58.305
He was this close
to being Imperial Physician.

00:24:58.385 --> 00:24:59.465
Even if he wanted to atone,

00:24:59.545 --> 00:25:01.225
he wouldn't throw his life away.

00:25:05.545 --> 00:25:08.145
Mr. Xiao, what are you thinking?

00:25:09.625 --> 00:25:12.585
About Talent Dong and Physician Luo,
Dianjiang lied.

00:25:12.665 --> 00:25:14.185
I thought it over carefully.

00:25:14.265 --> 00:25:16.425
When Talent Dong saw me
disguised as Luo Zhian,

00:25:16.505 --> 00:25:17.625
she was shaken,

00:25:17.705 --> 00:25:20.705
but it looked more
like a plea for help, not revenge.

00:25:21.865 --> 00:25:23.025
Let's question Dianjiang again.

00:25:30.865 --> 00:25:31.945
Why is it Dianjiang?

00:25:32.025 --> 00:25:33.425
This is the ceremonial gown

00:25:33.505 --> 00:25:34.745
Consort Shu wore
at her birthday feast two years ago.

00:25:39.345 --> 00:25:40.585
ALL HAIL WHITE ASURA

00:25:46.545 --> 00:25:48.505
The rack's fixed to the ground.

00:25:48.585 --> 00:25:50.385
No wonder it could hold her up
without falling over.

00:25:51.025 --> 00:25:52.585
The body's stiff.

00:25:52.665 --> 00:25:54.185
She's been dead at least two hours.

00:25:54.785 --> 00:25:56.145
Every lead ends in a death.

00:25:56.225 --> 00:25:57.625
What does this White Asura want?

00:25:59.265 --> 00:26:01.025
Dianjiang killed herself too?

00:26:06.985 --> 00:26:08.385
It took some doing.

00:26:08.985 --> 00:26:10.185
It's tied so tight.

00:26:10.265 --> 00:26:11.625
Could suicide do that?

00:26:12.985 --> 00:26:16.825
Pan Yongqi's plan
was to dress up suicide as murder.

00:26:16.905 --> 00:26:18.985
But things changed on the spot,
and we caught him.

00:26:19.065 --> 00:26:21.065
So he had someone else
light the pine strip for him.

00:26:22.265 --> 00:26:24.065
Luo Zhian went
to the Yin-Yang Road on purpose,

00:26:24.145 --> 00:26:24.985
so he'd run into Talent Dong.

00:26:25.585 --> 00:26:27.665
He wanted people to think
he was scared to death by a ghost,

00:26:27.745 --> 00:26:29.505
to cover up the truth

00:26:29.585 --> 00:26:30.905
that he needled himself
and triggered the attack.

00:26:32.785 --> 00:26:35.505
Dianjiang also died
with a talisman in her mouth.

00:26:35.585 --> 00:26:38.545
By White Asura's logic,

00:26:38.625 --> 00:26:40.425
it should've been suicide too.

00:26:42.185 --> 00:26:44.945
But her hands were tied.
How could she do it?

00:26:45.665 --> 00:26:46.905
We'll have to try and see.

00:26:49.105 --> 00:26:51.345
Dianjiang once served
in our Embroidery Office.

00:26:51.425 --> 00:26:52.265
CHIEF STEWARD
EMBROIDERY OFFICE, PALACE WORKSHOP SERVICE

00:26:52.345 --> 00:26:53.825
Her embroidery is superb.

00:26:53.905 --> 00:26:55.025
She'd been in the palace five years,

00:26:55.105 --> 00:26:56.505
quiet and unnoticed,

00:26:56.585 --> 00:27:00.705
until one day,
Consort Shu saw her pattern.

00:27:01.465 --> 00:27:03.305
Consort Shu praised her to the skies

00:27:03.385 --> 00:27:04.745
and ordered her to make

00:27:04.825 --> 00:27:06.305
the ceremonial gown
for the next year's birthday feast.

00:27:07.065 --> 00:27:10.185
She even promised her
all the gold thread and jewels she wanted.

00:27:10.265 --> 00:27:12.025
Dianjiang was stunned by the favor.

00:27:12.545 --> 00:27:14.465
That gown took a very long time.

00:27:14.985 --> 00:27:17.025
The whole piece used Yunjian embroidery.

00:27:18.185 --> 00:27:20.665
No other embroiderers here
could match Dianjiang's skill,

00:27:21.425 --> 00:27:23.745
so almost all of it was done by her alone.

00:27:25.745 --> 00:27:27.225
Until that day…

00:27:29.305 --> 00:27:30.385
You checked carefully?

00:27:30.465 --> 00:27:31.305
Yes.

00:27:31.385 --> 00:27:32.745
It can't be wrong.

00:27:32.825 --> 00:27:34.225
Does anyone else know?

00:27:34.785 --> 00:27:36.545
The moment I found out,
I came straight to you.

00:27:36.625 --> 00:27:38.185
I can't let anyone else know about this.

00:27:49.945 --> 00:27:52.185
Dianjiang, what are you doing?

00:27:57.825 --> 00:27:59.145
Is this gown beautiful?

00:27:59.825 --> 00:28:01.745
This is Consort Shu's gown!

00:28:03.065 --> 00:28:04.225
Then…

00:28:04.945 --> 00:28:06.705
Is Consort Shu's gown beautiful?

00:28:09.745 --> 00:28:11.145
After that,

00:28:12.145 --> 00:28:14.305
Dianjiang went back to acting normal.

00:28:15.505 --> 00:28:17.345
But I truly couldn't keep her.

00:28:17.945 --> 00:28:20.825
So I made an excuse
and transferred her to Qinghui Palace.

00:28:20.905 --> 00:28:22.945
Her sneaking the gown never got exposed.

00:28:23.025 --> 00:28:24.625
Dianjiang escaped death.

00:28:24.705 --> 00:28:26.745
But she'd never return
to the Embroidery Office.

00:28:27.785 --> 00:28:28.985
I never thought

00:28:30.265 --> 00:28:32.585
Dianjiang would still end up dying
inside that gown in the end.

00:28:34.065 --> 00:28:37.065
I don't know why she was
thrown out of the Embroidery Office.

00:28:37.145 --> 00:28:39.265
But day and night,
all she wanted was to go back.

00:28:39.345 --> 00:28:41.225
She cherished her hands the most.

00:28:41.305 --> 00:28:42.505
Every night,

00:28:42.585 --> 00:28:45.465
she'd soak them in warm water,
then rub on ointment.

00:28:45.545 --> 00:28:48.345
Her hands were even softer than my lady's.

00:28:48.425 --> 00:28:49.625
But lately,

00:28:49.705 --> 00:28:51.585
her hands were covered in sores.

00:28:52.305 --> 00:28:54.025
She hadn't sewn in a long time.

00:28:54.105 --> 00:28:55.185
Where's the ointment?

00:29:02.945 --> 00:29:06.265
Every bit of her modest monthly pay
went straight to this stuff.

00:29:08.465 --> 00:29:10.785
This was a gift from Consort Shu
back when she favored her.

00:29:10.865 --> 00:29:11.985
White Peony Balm.

00:29:12.065 --> 00:29:13.665
Fine and fragrant.

00:29:13.745 --> 00:29:15.705
She'd only dare use a little on holidays.

00:29:17.905 --> 00:29:19.505
Now her hands are ruined.

00:29:19.585 --> 00:29:21.305
She can't even hold a needle steady.

00:29:21.385 --> 00:29:22.905
To her, that's worse than death.

00:29:29.865 --> 00:29:30.945
Medical Officer Zhao.

00:29:35.625 --> 00:29:36.665
Your Ladyship.

00:29:37.345 --> 00:29:38.465
I tested it with a silver needle.

00:29:38.545 --> 00:29:39.825
This balm is laced with poison.

00:29:39.905 --> 00:29:41.665
But it's colorless and odorless.
I can't tell what it is.

00:29:41.745 --> 00:29:42.785
Try it.

00:29:43.865 --> 00:29:46.145
What a treat.
Thank you for thinking of me.

00:29:51.945 --> 00:29:53.025
Rest assured.

00:29:53.105 --> 00:29:54.785
Within three days,
I'll find out exactly what it is.

00:29:55.745 --> 00:29:56.865
Thanks.

00:30:01.825 --> 00:30:04.105
That one… looks nice.

00:30:04.945 --> 00:30:07.305
Let go! Let go!

00:30:07.385 --> 00:30:08.425
Gu Lingzhou!

00:30:12.265 --> 00:30:13.385
Gu Lingzhou!

00:30:16.785 --> 00:30:18.905
If this rack had been fixed
to the floor like Dianjiang's,

00:30:18.985 --> 00:30:20.585
you'd have strangled yourself just now.

00:30:20.665 --> 00:30:22.145
I'm fine.

00:30:26.785 --> 00:30:28.705
It's been an hour,
and we're getting nowhere.

00:30:28.785 --> 00:30:29.905
Want me to carry you?

00:30:29.985 --> 00:30:31.185
No. Absolutely not.

00:30:32.385 --> 00:30:34.585
- Mr. Xiao.
- Where's Her Ladyship?

00:30:34.665 --> 00:30:37.105
- Investigating at Qinghui Palace.
- Investigating what?

00:30:37.705 --> 00:30:39.625
How Dianjiang managed to kill herself.

00:30:51.465 --> 00:30:52.505
Peiyi!

00:30:54.905 --> 00:30:55.745
You want to see me?

00:31:00.465 --> 00:31:02.145
What? Worried about me?

00:31:02.825 --> 00:31:03.865
Afraid I'd hang myself?

00:31:18.905 --> 00:31:21.305
I borrowed it from Medical Officer Zhao.

00:31:21.385 --> 00:31:22.745
I can't afford this if it's ruined.

00:31:22.825 --> 00:31:24.625
Is there anything
in this palace you can't afford?

00:31:25.225 --> 00:31:28.305
This dummy was made
to mimic real joints and acupoints.

00:31:28.385 --> 00:31:29.865
So there is, just this dummy.

00:31:29.945 --> 00:31:31.745
Besides Medical Officer Zhao,
only I can use it.

00:31:31.825 --> 00:31:32.665
It's priceless.

00:31:35.665 --> 00:31:37.385
Why are you making that face?

00:31:38.705 --> 00:31:41.265
Mr. Xiao, I didn't snatch this dummy!

00:31:45.145 --> 00:31:46.305
This isn't ordinary rope.

00:31:47.225 --> 00:31:48.265
It's rattan-fiber cord.

00:31:49.665 --> 00:31:51.225
It grows underwater.

00:31:51.305 --> 00:31:53.505
Once dried, it's braided into rope,

00:31:53.585 --> 00:31:54.705
tough as can be.

00:31:54.785 --> 00:31:57.665
Soak it in hot water, and it turns soft.

00:31:58.745 --> 00:32:00.425
Once it cools, it slowly tightens again.

00:32:00.505 --> 00:32:03.185
That's how Dianjiang killed herself.

00:32:33.225 --> 00:32:39.465
DO NOT ATTEMPT. DANGEROUS ACT

00:33:13.985 --> 00:33:15.945
But on Dianjiang's body,

00:33:16.025 --> 00:33:17.625
there were no signs of struggle.

00:33:19.225 --> 00:33:21.425
In her room, I found Softening Powder.

00:33:21.505 --> 00:33:24.665
She likely took it
to keep herself from struggling.

00:33:25.985 --> 00:33:28.825
So you have solved how Dianjiang died.

00:33:29.905 --> 00:33:30.785
Then I can rest easy.

00:33:32.425 --> 00:33:34.345
Mr. Xiao, wait!

00:33:35.905 --> 00:33:37.105
This dummy

00:33:37.185 --> 00:33:39.345
was given to me by Medical Officer Zhao
the moment she heard

00:33:39.425 --> 00:33:40.785
I wanted to reenact Dianjiang's death!

00:33:41.945 --> 00:33:43.025
Of course.

00:33:43.105 --> 00:33:46.625
Everyone's things in this palace
will gladly be handed over to you.

00:33:46.705 --> 00:33:47.545
What's so strange about that?

00:33:48.425 --> 00:33:49.425
No, I mean…

00:33:50.025 --> 00:33:52.145
I didn't snatch it, and I didn't steal it!

00:33:52.225 --> 00:33:53.225
I didn't force her either.

00:33:53.305 --> 00:33:55.305
I only just learned
she had such a treasure.

00:33:58.465 --> 00:34:00.625
How did you figure out

00:34:00.705 --> 00:34:04.185
the key to Dianjiang's suicide
was that special rattan-fiber cord?

00:34:04.265 --> 00:34:07.945
On Dianjiang's neck and limbs,
besides the rope marks,

00:34:08.025 --> 00:34:11.025
there was also
a ring of small blisters from scalding.

00:34:11.105 --> 00:34:13.505
So I guessed it wasn't ordinary rope.

00:34:13.585 --> 00:34:16.905
White Asura would do this for no reason?

00:34:18.344 --> 00:34:20.505
We've had all sorts of scams here before.

00:34:20.585 --> 00:34:22.824
Either someone behind them
was after wealth or lust

00:34:22.905 --> 00:34:24.665
or it was for power.

00:34:24.744 --> 00:34:27.225
Some even wanted to curse others.

00:34:28.425 --> 00:34:30.905
But White Asura only wanted to kill.

00:34:31.505 --> 00:34:33.945
Now their followers are dying one by one.

00:34:34.025 --> 00:34:35.585
What benefit does that bring
to White Asura?

00:34:36.425 --> 00:34:39.665
I'm afraid the White Asura now
is no longer the same as before.

00:34:43.465 --> 00:34:44.705
There's another issue.

00:34:44.784 --> 00:34:46.425
How did Dianjiang obtain that gown?

00:34:46.505 --> 00:34:47.344
I looked into it.

00:34:47.425 --> 00:34:50.065
A few days ago, Consort Shu's palace
was thrown into chaos

00:34:50.145 --> 00:34:52.344
when her parrot, Lady in Snow,
suddenly panicked and flew wildly.

00:34:52.425 --> 00:34:54.264
They all went after that parrot,

00:34:54.344 --> 00:34:56.585
and the gown
was likely lost during that time.

00:34:58.225 --> 00:35:01.665
So the gown's storeroom
wasn't broken into or messed with?

00:35:02.705 --> 00:35:03.905
Clean and neat.

00:35:03.985 --> 00:35:05.465
If not for Dianjiang's case,

00:35:05.545 --> 00:35:07.265
they wouldn't have known
the gown was lost.

00:35:07.345 --> 00:35:10.305
Before, there was no time frame
to charge her.

00:35:10.905 --> 00:35:12.505
Now, let's see what tricks she has left.

00:35:13.585 --> 00:35:14.705
Thanks for going to get her.

00:35:15.425 --> 00:35:16.265
My pleasure.

00:35:59.665 --> 00:36:01.025
White Asura!

00:36:01.705 --> 00:36:02.825
White…

00:36:04.985 --> 00:36:07.825
These two packs of fruit powder
were found in your room.

00:36:07.905 --> 00:36:11.265
One is the parrot's favorite,
and the other is what it hates.

00:36:11.345 --> 00:36:13.465
You controlled the parrot,

00:36:13.545 --> 00:36:15.265
helping White Asura
with many tasks, right?

00:36:15.345 --> 00:36:17.225
The ginseng seeds under the magnolia tree,

00:36:17.305 --> 00:36:18.545
the maze by the altar,

00:36:18.625 --> 00:36:20.705
and Consort Shu's gown,
all of it was you, wasn't it?

00:36:30.385 --> 00:36:31.825
No!

00:36:34.145 --> 00:36:34.985
You can talk now?

00:36:42.185 --> 00:36:44.905
I'll admit to what you say.

00:36:46.505 --> 00:36:48.985
The followers of White Asura,
though not nobles,

00:36:49.065 --> 00:36:53.145
have enough small power
to serve White Asura's needs.

00:36:53.905 --> 00:36:56.545
Pan Yongqi is familiar
with the patrol routes in the palace,

00:36:56.625 --> 00:36:58.785
Luo Zhian could get
the medicine and poison,

00:36:58.865 --> 00:37:01.985
and Dianjiang, being a Cold Palace maid,
had the most freedom to act.

00:37:02.065 --> 00:37:03.025
Am I right?

00:37:04.145 --> 00:37:05.665
Pan Yongqi's ginseng seeds,

00:37:06.185 --> 00:37:07.385
Luo Zhian being favored,

00:37:08.025 --> 00:37:09.625
and Dianjiang's long-cherished gown,

00:37:09.705 --> 00:37:11.745
it was all done this way?

00:37:13.505 --> 00:37:17.305
The blessings White Asura gave us
are beyond anything we could've imagined.

00:37:17.905 --> 00:37:20.545
Each one of us just does what we can.

00:37:21.465 --> 00:37:24.705
Everything is about
helping each other among you followers.

00:37:24.785 --> 00:37:26.185
What does White Asura have to do with it?

00:37:27.505 --> 00:37:28.985
Without White Asura,

00:37:29.065 --> 00:37:30.545
how would we help each other?

00:37:32.545 --> 00:37:34.625
Then why did White Asura cause suicides

00:37:34.705 --> 00:37:36.705
and take innocent lives?

00:37:37.345 --> 00:37:41.305
Only the most devout followers
are chosen to welcome White Asura.

00:37:41.385 --> 00:37:43.185
What an exalted honor!

00:37:43.265 --> 00:37:44.865
Tell us something we don't know.

00:37:46.825 --> 00:37:48.425
What do you want to know, Your Ladyship?

00:37:49.025 --> 00:37:51.425
Tell me about your sister, Gonglian.

00:37:51.945 --> 00:37:52.945
By the way,

00:37:53.025 --> 00:37:55.545
I also found out that Fuqu
has a sister named Gonglian.

00:37:55.625 --> 00:37:59.025
She used to serve Consort Shu
in the flower garden.

00:37:59.105 --> 00:38:00.545
One night two years ago,

00:38:00.625 --> 00:38:02.785
she jumped from a high building
by the Yin-Yang Road.

00:38:02.865 --> 00:38:05.185
Our bureau investigated
and concluded it was suicide.

00:38:08.105 --> 00:38:11.265
She fell from the high tower
to welcome White Asura too?

00:38:12.185 --> 00:38:15.465
If it weren't for her,
I wouldn't have encountered White Asura.

00:38:16.425 --> 00:38:17.785
If it weren't for her,

00:38:17.865 --> 00:38:19.905
White Asura wouldn't have abandoned us!

00:38:19.985 --> 00:38:20.945
It's all her fault!

00:38:21.905 --> 00:38:25.985
White Asura made the parrot
choose me from all the maids,

00:38:26.065 --> 00:38:28.105
so I wouldn't be bullied
in the Bureau of Gardens anymore.

00:38:28.745 --> 00:38:29.585
And Gonglian

00:38:30.465 --> 00:38:33.105
also received
many blessings from White Asura.

00:38:33.185 --> 00:38:35.505
But why did she abandon White Asura

00:38:35.585 --> 00:38:36.945
at the most crucial moment?

00:38:49.185 --> 00:38:50.305
White Asura…

00:38:53.225 --> 00:38:54.665
On the seventh day of next month,

00:38:55.385 --> 00:38:57.065
I will come.

00:38:57.665 --> 00:39:01.665
Faithful believer Gonglian,
hasten to welcome me.

00:39:02.905 --> 00:39:05.505
White Asura, how should I welcome you?

00:39:05.585 --> 00:39:06.705
White Asura?

00:39:18.385 --> 00:39:21.425
Welcoming means having her kill herself?

00:39:22.025 --> 00:39:23.105
That's not suicide.

00:39:23.185 --> 00:39:27.425
Being chosen to welcome him
is a huge blessing.

00:39:27.505 --> 00:39:30.665
Any believer would do so
without hesitation!

00:39:30.745 --> 00:39:32.985
But Gonglian not only feared death,

00:39:33.065 --> 00:39:35.345
but even slandered White Asura as false!

00:39:35.425 --> 00:39:38.865
She claimed she was the one behind it all!

00:39:39.745 --> 00:39:41.905
If all this was arranged by her
behind the scenes,

00:39:41.985 --> 00:39:44.225
then how could White Asura
enter our dreams

00:39:44.825 --> 00:39:47.465
and tell us he was about to descend?

00:39:49.105 --> 00:39:50.305
It's contradictory.

00:39:50.385 --> 00:39:51.505
It doesn't add up!

00:39:52.145 --> 00:39:53.905
White Asura helped her so much,

00:39:53.985 --> 00:39:55.225
but she only thought of herself.

00:39:55.305 --> 00:39:56.985
No matter what, she refused…

00:39:57.065 --> 00:39:58.745
So you forced her to die?

00:39:58.825 --> 00:40:00.265
We were helping her!

00:40:01.185 --> 00:40:02.225
You know?

00:40:04.625 --> 00:40:06.985
She saw White Asura
manifest before her own eyes.

00:40:07.065 --> 00:40:08.025
Of course she knew

00:40:08.105 --> 00:40:10.465
they would come back for her
after they first descended.

00:40:10.545 --> 00:40:14.345
But she was so confused, so useless!

00:40:14.945 --> 00:40:16.705
So you killed her?

00:40:17.465 --> 00:40:19.105
What's the point of killing her?

00:40:21.105 --> 00:40:24.265
Welcoming White Asura
requires true sincerity.

00:40:24.865 --> 00:40:26.425
We wouldn't kill her.

00:40:27.985 --> 00:40:30.905
Maybe she realized it in the end.

00:40:30.985 --> 00:40:34.705
But she left on the very day
White Asura was meant to descend.

00:40:35.425 --> 00:40:36.505
It was too late then.

00:40:36.585 --> 00:40:38.025
It wouldn't help.

00:40:39.265 --> 00:40:40.505
After that,

00:40:40.585 --> 00:40:43.025
White Asura never appeared
in our dreams again.

00:40:43.665 --> 00:40:44.545
He abandoned us.

00:40:48.545 --> 00:40:51.505
How many people knew that Gonglian
should welcome White Asura?

00:40:53.545 --> 00:40:55.105
Many followers knew.

00:40:55.825 --> 00:40:58.665
And how many people
helped her make the final decision?

00:41:00.945 --> 00:41:01.785
I don't know.

00:41:04.305 --> 00:41:05.225
Luo Zhian,

00:41:06.705 --> 00:41:08.105
Pan Yongqi,

00:41:09.545 --> 00:41:10.465
Dianjiang,

00:41:11.745 --> 00:41:12.865
and you.

00:41:15.465 --> 00:41:17.025
We were helping her!

00:41:17.105 --> 00:41:19.585
What if White Asura let you welcome him?

00:41:24.545 --> 00:41:25.745
That would be…

00:41:26.585 --> 00:41:28.625
my highest honor.

00:41:33.905 --> 00:41:37.545
I'll ascend with you.

00:41:39.185 --> 00:41:40.025
Wuren!

00:41:43.345 --> 00:41:44.265
You won't die.

00:41:45.145 --> 00:41:46.305
White Asura won't come either.

00:41:46.385 --> 00:41:47.785
Someone!

00:41:49.345 --> 00:41:50.865
- Your Ladyship.
- Keep an eye on her.

00:41:50.945 --> 00:41:52.145
Understood!

00:41:57.025 --> 00:41:58.745
Your Ladyship, I've found it.

00:41:58.825 --> 00:42:00.985
Southwest people
are practicing witchcraft.

00:42:01.065 --> 00:42:02.545
During the early autumn epidemic,

00:42:02.625 --> 00:42:04.465
they claimed to have
a secret method of healing.

00:42:04.545 --> 00:42:05.705
No need to drink medicine,

00:42:05.785 --> 00:42:08.505
just follow certain rituals,
write on a bowl of water in the air,

00:42:08.585 --> 00:42:10.905
then drink the water from the bowl,
and the illness would be cured.

00:42:10.985 --> 00:42:12.425
And it actually worked.

00:42:12.505 --> 00:42:14.265
Many palace maids
and eunuchs came to see him,

00:42:15.105 --> 00:42:16.185
and he made a lot of money.

00:42:16.825 --> 00:42:17.665
What kind of person?

00:42:17.745 --> 00:42:20.625
The eunuch in charge of night patrol
and timekeeping, Wang Anping.

00:42:21.825 --> 00:42:23.945
He has easy access to the palace at night.

00:42:24.865 --> 00:42:26.105
Where is he now?

00:42:26.185 --> 00:42:27.705
We've detained him.
We're searching his room now.

00:42:39.225 --> 00:42:42.025
WANG ANPING, EUNUCH

00:42:42.985 --> 00:42:44.345
You are White Asura, aren't you?

00:42:44.425 --> 00:42:46.425
No… No…

00:42:46.505 --> 00:42:47.745
What do you mean no?

00:42:48.265 --> 00:42:49.585
Still denying it?

00:42:50.625 --> 00:42:51.465
Yes…

00:42:52.945 --> 00:42:56.025
- I am, but not completely.
- Speak plainly!

00:42:57.185 --> 00:42:58.865
ALL HAIL WHITE ASURA

00:43:03.985 --> 00:43:04.865
Your Ladyship,

00:43:05.665 --> 00:43:07.465
I just asked them to serve me faithfully,

00:43:07.545 --> 00:43:08.585
promising they'd be reborn

00:43:09.185 --> 00:43:11.745
as wealthy and noble souls
in their next life.

00:43:15.465 --> 00:43:16.825
Your Ladyship… Your Ladyship…

00:43:18.745 --> 00:43:21.625
They only gave me offerings!

00:43:21.705 --> 00:43:22.985
But it was all voluntary!

00:43:24.705 --> 00:43:28.025
I just wanted to make some money.

00:43:28.105 --> 00:43:30.025
I never planned to cause anyone's death.

00:43:30.105 --> 00:43:32.025
The killings by White Asura
have nothing to do with me.

00:43:32.785 --> 00:43:35.065
Their deaths have nothing to do with you?

00:43:35.145 --> 00:43:35.985
What about Gonglian?

00:43:36.065 --> 00:43:38.505
The Palace Investigation Bureau
already investigated.

00:43:38.585 --> 00:43:39.745
Gonglian…

00:43:40.625 --> 00:43:42.065
committed suicide.

00:43:42.785 --> 00:43:45.905
You egged on those followers
and pushed her to her death.

00:43:45.985 --> 00:43:47.345
Your hands may be clean of this,

00:43:47.425 --> 00:43:49.265
but that doesn't make you innocent.

00:43:49.945 --> 00:43:51.945
But I didn't kill her!

00:43:52.465 --> 00:43:54.785
Even if you bring me before His Majesty,

00:43:54.865 --> 00:43:56.865
I am not guilty.
