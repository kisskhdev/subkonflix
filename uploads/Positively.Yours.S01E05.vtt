[This drama is fictional and any similarity
with reality is purely coincidental.]

00:00:40.215 --> 00:00:42.538
[Production guidelines were followed
when filming children and animals.]

00:00:42.538 --> 00:00:44.048
I even wonder why

00:00:44.048 --> 00:00:45.338
[Episode 5]
I'm talking about this right now.

00:00:45.338 --> 00:00:49.738
It's just that I want you to feel a bit
at ease, at least for today.

00:00:52.138 --> 00:00:53.838
Does this mean

00:00:54.972 --> 00:00:57.272
I'm falling for you?

00:01:06.272 --> 00:01:08.705
- I mean...
- Wait a minute.

00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:12.905
Sorry, but you should go first.

00:01:17.472 --> 00:01:19.805
Can I have a word with you?

00:01:43.605 --> 00:01:45.205
- That's not it.
- Not what, exactly?

00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:47.638
You're not doing this because you like me.

00:01:47.638 --> 00:01:51.105
It's just because you saw my mom's text

00:01:51.105 --> 00:01:54.338
and felt bad for me.

00:01:54.338 --> 00:01:56.805
Do you start liking someone
just because you pity them?

00:01:56.805 --> 00:01:58.505
I don't.

00:01:58.505 --> 00:02:01.472
I wasn't sure how to define this
until I said it out loud,

00:02:01.472 --> 00:02:03.738
but now I'm sure.

00:02:03.738 --> 00:02:07.305
To be precise, it's because I like you.

00:02:09.772 --> 00:02:12.005
President, I...

00:02:13.972 --> 00:02:16.005
I mean, I just...

00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:19.772
I don't think this will work.

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:22.672
I'll pretend I didn't hear any of this.

00:02:25.005 --> 00:02:26.705
No...

00:02:41.372 --> 00:02:45.105
Right, he's the President.

00:02:45.105 --> 00:02:47.172
Born into wealth.

00:02:47.172 --> 00:02:50.338
If I got involved, I'd only get hurt.

00:02:50.338 --> 00:02:52.805
And that would be the best-case scenario.

00:02:52.805 --> 00:02:54.772
My Yeol Mu...

00:02:57.038 --> 00:02:58.705
Yeah.

00:02:58.705 --> 00:03:02.072
I did the right thing. I did good.

00:03:06.538 --> 00:03:09.838
Does this mean I'm falling for you?

00:03:09.838 --> 00:03:12.405
To be precise, it's because I like you.

00:03:12.405 --> 00:03:15.905
Ah, it drives me crazy.

00:03:15.905 --> 00:03:18.838
Why is my heart beating so wildly?

00:03:23.105 --> 00:03:24.838
It's okay.

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:28.101
What have I done?

00:03:28.101 --> 00:03:29.913
Jeez.

00:03:32.472 --> 00:03:33.772
What is this, some new workout?

00:03:33.772 --> 00:03:35.205
Does that help clear your head?

00:03:35.205 --> 00:03:36.638
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

00:03:36.638 --> 00:03:39.238
Sorry.

00:03:39.238 --> 00:03:41.838
Anyone would think you
just confessed and got rejected.

00:03:43.038 --> 00:03:44.138
Is it true?

00:03:44.138 --> 00:03:46.638
Hui Won said she doesn't like you?

00:03:47.605 --> 00:03:49.438
I don't know.

00:03:49.438 --> 00:03:51.838
How am I supposed to face her at work now?

00:03:51.838 --> 00:03:52.872
Why couldn't you?

00:03:52.872 --> 00:03:55.705
The rejecter should feel awkward.
The rejected should be proud.

00:03:55.705 --> 00:03:57.838
Is being honest about your feelings a crime?

00:03:57.838 --> 00:04:01.105
Square your shoulders! Engage your core!

00:04:01.105 --> 00:04:02.805
Down.

00:04:06.005 --> 00:04:09.172
- What's wrong?
- Wait, I've got a cramp! A cramp!

00:04:09.172 --> 00:04:10.338
That hurts!

00:04:10.338 --> 00:04:11.438
Ouch, it hurts.

00:04:11.438 --> 00:04:14.472
Hold on, I've got a cramp too.

00:04:14.472 --> 00:04:17.438
Yes, I understand.

00:04:18.105 --> 00:04:19.838
Then text me right away.

00:04:19.838 --> 00:04:22.572
I'll check my schedule and get back to you.

00:04:22.572 --> 00:04:24.405
Okay.

00:04:29.538 --> 00:04:31.638
My life got completely ruined because of you.

00:04:31.638 --> 00:04:34.472
You should never have been born.

00:04:41.038 --> 00:04:43.405
Why didn't you contact me?

00:04:48.072 --> 00:04:50.472
That day, I...

00:05:00.338 --> 00:05:01.805
How shameless of me.

00:05:01.805 --> 00:05:04.038
After saying those things, I...

00:05:05.672 --> 00:05:07.938
Why is this so hard on us?

00:05:21.172 --> 00:05:23.305
How can I face him from now on?

00:05:23.305 --> 00:05:25.538
Being honest isn't a crime.

00:05:37.905 --> 00:05:40.605
Where did she pop up from all of a sudden?

00:05:48.738 --> 00:05:50.438
Where did she go?

00:06:20.072 --> 00:06:23.505
Wait, we don't need to make things awkward.

00:06:41.905 --> 00:06:44.138
Last time, targeting campers,

00:06:44.138 --> 00:06:46.372
we briefly ran a pairing promotion

00:06:46.372 --> 00:06:50.405
where people could enjoy our Taehan Beer
alongside various camping events.

00:06:50.405 --> 00:06:55.405
The results showed good response
and decent sales performance.

00:06:55.405 --> 00:06:57.672
Given the recent increase
in camping enthusiasts,

00:06:57.672 --> 00:07:01.572
for Taehan beer to position itself
as the best beer for camping,

00:07:01.572 --> 00:07:04.138
we believe these initiatives
need to be long-term

00:07:04.138 --> 00:07:08.005
and substantive, not just one-off events.

00:07:08.005 --> 00:07:10.672
That's why we...

00:07:18.738 --> 00:07:19.838
Are you avoiding me?

00:07:19.838 --> 00:07:21.338
- Me?
- Am I making you uncomfortable?

00:07:21.338 --> 00:07:23.038
Oh, not at all.

00:07:23.038 --> 00:07:25.205
It's a misunderstanding, really.

00:07:25.205 --> 00:07:26.972
Misunderstanding?

00:07:26.972 --> 00:07:30.538
If there's nothing else, I've got work to do.

00:07:35.572 --> 00:07:37.472
She's avoiding me.

00:07:46.805 --> 00:07:50.105
Why do we keep running into
each other? This is awkward.

00:07:55.638 --> 00:07:58.638
Jang Hui Won, why didn't you
answer your phone?

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:10.838
What happened yesterday?

00:08:10.838 --> 00:08:12.581
I told you to text me when you
got home, but no response.

00:08:12.581 --> 00:08:13.705
Jeez.

00:08:13.705 --> 00:08:17.905
I'm the one who turned him down,
yet I seem more bothered by it.

00:08:20.272 --> 00:08:21.638
Are you listening?

00:08:21.638 --> 00:08:23.172
Yeah.

00:08:23.172 --> 00:08:25.505
I'm asking what happened.

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:28.238
Are you two dating?

00:08:28.238 --> 00:08:31.838
No, no, it's not like that.

00:08:31.838 --> 00:08:35.805
If it wasn't that, then
what did you say to him?

00:08:37.705 --> 00:08:39.505
Honestly, I regretted it the whole way home.

00:08:39.505 --> 00:08:42.305
I shouldn't have stepped aside.

00:08:42.305 --> 00:08:44.005
Why?

00:08:49.672 --> 00:08:50.672
Well...

00:08:50.672 --> 00:08:52.672
You must've been really embarrassed.

00:08:52.672 --> 00:08:54.438
I mean,

00:08:54.438 --> 00:08:55.472
he came at you so recklessly,

00:08:55.472 --> 00:08:57.172
right in front of me...

00:08:57.172 --> 00:08:59.672
You're the type to get startled

00:08:59.672 --> 00:09:02.005
and run away when someone suddenly pushes in.

00:09:02.705 --> 00:09:05.938
So, it bothered me that I couldn't step in

00:09:05.938 --> 00:09:07.013
and protect you.

00:09:07.013 --> 00:09:08.905
Oh.

00:09:08.905 --> 00:09:09.972
I thought...

00:09:09.972 --> 00:09:12.605
Protect me from what? We're friends.

00:09:12.605 --> 00:09:15.072
My sleepiness is gone. Need to go back.

00:09:15.072 --> 00:09:16.805
Thanks for the drink.

00:09:25.472 --> 00:09:27.272
This is driving me crazy.

00:09:36.638 --> 00:09:39.005
Weren't you close with Reporter Park?

00:09:39.005 --> 00:09:42.938
He pulled that postpartum care center
no-alcohol article immediately last time.

00:09:43.605 --> 00:09:46.038
It's not easy being the target
of everyone's anger.

00:09:46.038 --> 00:09:48.638
A reporter needs to have persistence.

00:09:49.738 --> 00:09:52.205
I had him disciplined
through the Deputy Editor.

00:09:52.205 --> 00:09:53.672
Oh.

00:09:53.672 --> 00:09:56.872
Good job. Well done.

00:09:59.272 --> 00:10:03.105
Since it's come to this,
let's stir things up a bit.

00:10:03.805 --> 00:10:08.372
If we damage Taehan Liquor's image,

00:10:08.372 --> 00:10:11.205
the board will have
no choice but to step in, right?

00:10:11.205 --> 00:10:15.105
- How?
- You know Oh Jin Woo, Taehan Liquor's model?

00:10:15.105 --> 00:10:18.205
Seems he was recently scammed
big time in an investment.

00:10:18.205 --> 00:10:22.505
There's no one easier to control
than someone desperate for money.

00:10:22.505 --> 00:10:23.738
Slip him some cash

00:10:23.738 --> 00:10:25.838
and ask him to stir up
just enough controversy...

00:10:25.838 --> 00:10:28.805
How are you going to clean up
the mess after that?

00:10:29.638 --> 00:10:33.572
Instead of money to buy his silence,
how about buying him a drink?

00:10:33.572 --> 00:10:35.005
Heard he likes his drinks, right?

00:10:35.005 --> 00:10:36.672
A drink?

00:10:36.672 --> 00:10:41.138
People who like drinking often make mistakes.

00:10:55.005 --> 00:10:56.405
Ah, Team Leader.

00:10:56.405 --> 00:10:58.105
Yes?

00:10:58.105 --> 00:11:00.138
What's with our ace? Why the long face?

00:11:00.138 --> 00:11:02.605
Like someone who just lost a big sale.

00:11:02.605 --> 00:11:04.605
What? This is even more suspicious.

00:11:04.605 --> 00:11:06.305
Tell me. My lips are sealed.

00:11:06.305 --> 00:11:08.705
I know, yes, I know.

00:11:12.038 --> 00:11:13.805
Um...

00:11:13.805 --> 00:11:16.705
This isn't about me, it's about a friend.

00:11:16.705 --> 00:11:17.705
Okay.

00:11:17.705 --> 00:11:20.772
So, someone confessed
to my friend's female friend

00:11:20.772 --> 00:11:23.272
right in front of him.

00:11:23.272 --> 00:11:27.105
Logically, as a friend,
he should be supportive,

00:11:27.105 --> 00:11:30.172
but secretly, it seems he hopes
she'll reject the confession.

00:11:30.172 --> 00:11:31.172
Hold on.

00:11:31.172 --> 00:11:33.905
So, did that friend commit
some serious crime?

00:11:33.905 --> 00:11:35.772
Or does he have some major flaw?

00:11:35.772 --> 00:11:37.438
No, it's nothing like that.

00:11:37.438 --> 00:11:39.005
No? Then the answer is simple.

00:11:39.005 --> 00:11:40.572
He likes her. That female friend.

00:11:40.572 --> 00:11:41.905
Pardon?

00:11:41.905 --> 00:11:43.238
Are you stupid, Assistant Manager Cha?

00:11:43.238 --> 00:11:46.138
You should've made a scene,
but why just watch?

00:11:46.138 --> 00:11:48.805
It's always the ones who don't
even know their own feelings,

00:11:48.805 --> 00:11:49.838
hiding behind friendship

00:11:49.838 --> 00:11:52.605
and saying, 'We're friends forever!'

00:11:54.305 --> 00:11:55.429
I'm getting married.

00:11:55.429 --> 00:11:56.773
What?

00:11:57.472 --> 00:12:00.672
You'll come to the wedding, right?

00:12:03.238 --> 00:12:04.938
Hui Won.

00:12:06.841 --> 00:12:08.901
[Wedding day]

00:12:15.525 --> 00:12:17.038
[Kang Du Jun and Jang Hui Won]
No way.

00:12:17.038 --> 00:12:18.038
No way.

00:12:18.038 --> 00:12:20.305
This makes no sense.

00:12:20.305 --> 00:12:22.149
No!

00:12:23.872 --> 00:12:24.905
That's so shallow.

00:12:24.905 --> 00:12:26.172
I said no!

00:12:26.172 --> 00:12:28.205
Assistant Manager Cha! Assistant Manager Cha!

00:12:28.205 --> 00:12:29.472
- Yes?
- Oh, dear.

00:12:29.472 --> 00:12:32.472
It's not too late! Go after her!

00:12:32.472 --> 00:12:36.138
Running after a bus that's already gone
will only make you sore.

00:12:36.138 --> 00:12:38.341
No, this isn't about me.

00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:41.405
Don't thank me. It's nothing.

00:12:50.838 --> 00:12:52.972
I mean, I just...
I don't think this will work.

00:12:52.972 --> 00:12:54.472
I'll pretend I didn't hear any of this.

00:12:54.472 --> 00:12:57.538
If there's nothing else, I've got work to do.

00:13:01.338 --> 00:13:03.938
We did upper body yesterday.
How about lower body today?

00:13:03.938 --> 00:13:06.705
I noticed your core strength
was a bit weak yesterday.

00:13:06.705 --> 00:13:08.405
Your shoulders seem a bit slumped too.

00:13:08.405 --> 00:13:10.538
I'll stick with you one-on-one
and coach you properly.

00:13:10.538 --> 00:13:13.105
Forget it. I'll just rest today.
Not in the mood.

00:13:13.105 --> 00:13:15.272
I see it now. There is a reason
your shoulders are slumped.

00:13:15.272 --> 00:13:16.672
What is it this time?

00:13:16.672 --> 00:13:18.372
Tell me everything.

00:13:18.372 --> 00:13:20.572
Wasn't it you who told me
to stand tall and be confident?

00:13:20.572 --> 00:13:22.038
What's the point of being confident

00:13:22.038 --> 00:13:23.405
if she won't even face me?

00:13:23.405 --> 00:13:25.705
Is Hui Won avoiding you?

00:13:27.872 --> 00:13:31.605
On second thought, I'd feel pressured too.

00:13:32.472 --> 00:13:34.972
I mean, it's not just a coworker,

00:13:34.972 --> 00:13:36.472
it's the President confessing his feelings.

00:13:36.472 --> 00:13:38.205
Who would just accept that so easily?

00:13:38.205 --> 00:13:40.372
Maybe in dramas.

00:13:41.138 --> 00:13:42.738
Is that so?

00:13:42.738 --> 00:13:44.338
Was I only thinking about my own feelings?

00:13:44.338 --> 00:13:46.805
Emotions don't work the way we want them to.

00:13:46.805 --> 00:13:50.605
Still, in times like this, honesty is best.

00:13:50.605 --> 00:13:52.172
What if I'm honest and she avoids me again?

00:13:52.172 --> 00:13:54.438
Ah, come on.

00:13:54.438 --> 00:13:57.905
Sitting here worrying
won't solve anything, you know?

00:13:57.905 --> 00:13:59.905
You've got something you're good at.

00:13:59.905 --> 00:14:01.605
Just...

00:14:03.905 --> 00:14:06.105
Go for it head-on.

00:14:10.572 --> 00:14:12.272
You startled me.

00:14:13.505 --> 00:14:14.505
Where are you going?

00:14:14.505 --> 00:14:16.037
You don't need to know.

00:14:16.037 --> 00:14:17.592
You...

00:14:18.238 --> 00:14:20.905
He's surprisingly good
at listening to others.

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:35.172
May I have a word?

00:14:43.805 --> 00:14:45.972
This doesn't seem like a misunderstanding.

00:14:45.972 --> 00:14:47.705
It is a misunderstanding. Got proof?

00:14:47.705 --> 00:14:50.372
The fact you're asking
for proof tells me everything.

00:14:50.372 --> 00:14:51.772
This won't do.

00:14:51.772 --> 00:14:54.138
It seems my confession
is making you uncomfortable.

00:14:54.138 --> 00:14:55.272
No, it's not that.

00:14:55.272 --> 00:14:57.105
I'm not asking for an answer.

00:14:57.105 --> 00:14:58.705
I was just frustrated.

00:14:58.705 --> 00:15:03.538
If I didn't say it, it felt like
I was lying to myself. It's just venting.

00:15:03.538 --> 00:15:07.338
Whether I hide my feelings
or hold them back, that's for me to handle.

00:15:07.338 --> 00:15:09.972
So stop avoiding me from now on.

00:15:09.972 --> 00:15:13.105
Because I want to keep seeing you.

00:15:27.838 --> 00:15:29.572
Who's there?

00:15:30.605 --> 00:15:32.572
Get over here, quick!

00:16:17.072 --> 00:16:19.372
Still, you shouldn't shove someone like that.

00:16:19.372 --> 00:16:22.505
I got a cramp! A cramp!

00:16:25.432 --> 00:16:27.013
Jeez.

00:16:28.472 --> 00:16:31.438
Says she has a cramp but runs just fine.

00:16:31.438 --> 00:16:32.438
I told you.

00:16:32.438 --> 00:16:35.272
I can't even breathe if I can't see you.

00:16:35.272 --> 00:16:38.005
Not for a day, not even a single second.

00:16:38.005 --> 00:16:39.938
You're my oxygen.

00:16:39.938 --> 00:16:41.272
So don't avoid me.

00:16:41.272 --> 00:16:43.205
I'm not avoiding you!

00:16:43.205 --> 00:16:44.605
Then what is it?

00:16:44.605 --> 00:16:46.005
You avoid eye contact,

00:16:46.005 --> 00:16:47.038
run away when we meet,

00:16:47.038 --> 00:16:48.272
and pretend not to hear me when I call you.

00:16:48.272 --> 00:16:51.738
Well... I don't know
why I'm like this either.

00:16:51.738 --> 00:16:53.572
Does this mean I'm falling for you?

00:16:53.572 --> 00:16:55.272
Whether I hide my feelings or hold them back,

00:16:55.272 --> 00:16:56.538
that's for me to handle.

00:16:56.538 --> 00:16:58.205
So stop avoiding me from now on.

00:16:58.205 --> 00:17:01.005
Because I want to keep seeing you.

00:17:01.005 --> 00:17:04.005
Why is he being so honest?

00:17:05.438 --> 00:17:07.372
Whenever I think of you,

00:17:07.372 --> 00:17:10.538
my heart keeps going thump thump.

00:17:10.538 --> 00:17:11.738
Don't hide those feelings.

00:17:11.738 --> 00:17:13.172
- Did she...
- I'll take responsibility.

00:17:13.172 --> 00:17:15.038
I thought she said Du Jun.

00:17:15.038 --> 00:17:18.205
Ah, I must be crazy. Why am I like this?

00:17:19.005 --> 00:17:21.205
I need to get a grip.

00:17:35.038 --> 00:17:37.672
Has he always been that tall?

00:17:48.138 --> 00:17:51.805
Let's keep the new product lineup
for the first-half of next year as is.

00:17:51.805 --> 00:17:52.805
But earlier, I noticed

00:17:52.805 --> 00:17:55.272
the promotional items tied
to food brand collaborations

00:17:55.272 --> 00:17:58.438
seem to lack competitor analysis data.

00:18:25.797 --> 00:18:28.805
What? What's wrong with me?

00:18:29.572 --> 00:18:31.172
Report back immediately.

00:18:31.172 --> 00:18:33.772
Oh, and I heard the Try Golden Ratio Glass

00:18:33.772 --> 00:18:35.072
got great feedback.

00:18:35.072 --> 00:18:37.705
When launching the new product...

00:18:53.505 --> 00:18:56.405
Share today's discussion
with Purchasing and Marketing,

00:18:56.405 --> 00:18:58.905
and we'll schedule a follow-up for details.

00:18:58.905 --> 00:19:00.638
Yes.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.597
Oh.

00:19:12.772 --> 00:19:14.472
Um...

00:19:17.049 --> 00:19:18.680
Oh you...

00:19:21.005 --> 00:19:23.138
I guess I went way too hard...

00:19:25.105 --> 00:19:27.972
in those meetings
and now my throat's on fire.

00:19:27.972 --> 00:19:29.672
Yes.

00:19:31.605 --> 00:19:34.972
Ah, why is this happening? Is it defective?

00:19:35.638 --> 00:19:37.105
It happens occasionally.

00:19:37.105 --> 00:19:39.038
Of course.

00:19:39.038 --> 00:19:40.738
Just a moment.

00:19:45.172 --> 00:19:47.005
Why won't this open?

00:19:51.638 --> 00:19:53.005
Ow, darn it.

00:19:53.005 --> 00:19:56.372
Wow, this is no ordinary bottle.

00:19:56.372 --> 00:19:59.505
Excuse me for a moment.

00:20:10.238 --> 00:20:11.972
Well then...

00:20:17.538 --> 00:20:19.605
That was so cool.

00:20:37.705 --> 00:20:40.072
Confess twice and you'll lose your mind.

00:20:40.072 --> 00:20:42.172
Did Hui Won say yes then?

00:20:42.172 --> 00:20:44.738
Someone like you wouldn't understand.

00:20:44.738 --> 00:20:47.338
You're not the Kang Du Jun I know.

00:20:47.338 --> 00:20:49.938
Where did that cold, sharp-eyed guy go?

00:20:49.938 --> 00:20:51.472
Where did this clumsy guy come from?

00:20:51.472 --> 00:20:53.472
Who are you?

00:20:53.472 --> 00:20:54.738
Clumsy guy?

00:20:54.738 --> 00:20:56.705
You're the clumsy one.

00:20:56.705 --> 00:21:01.372
Every single day is popcorn-worthy drama.

00:21:03.105 --> 00:21:04.872
What's that now?

00:21:08.905 --> 00:21:11.105
Around 11 p.m. last night in Gangnam, Seoul,

00:21:11.105 --> 00:21:15.405
celebrity Mr. Oh crashed
into a tree while drunk driving.

00:21:15.405 --> 00:21:17.165
[Actor Oh's DUI crash]
According to police,

00:21:17.165 --> 00:21:18.872
after drinking with acquaintances,

he caused the accident on his way home.

00:21:21.638 --> 00:21:26.138
[Actor Oh's BAC at license revocation level]
At the time of arrest, his BAC was 0.143%.

00:21:26.138 --> 00:21:27.872
[Actor Oh crashed into a tree]
Fortunately, there were no casualties,

00:21:27.872 --> 00:21:30.373
[Controversy over the 5-year beer ad model]
but Mr. Oh has been a beer model

00:21:30.373 --> 00:21:32.238
for a liquor company for five years,

00:21:32.238 --> 00:21:34.117
making the shock even greater.

00:21:34.117 --> 00:21:35.242
[Actor Oh's DUI accident]
Due to this incident,

00:21:35.242 --> 00:21:36.338
- projects starring Oh...
- Look.

00:21:36.338 --> 00:21:37.772
It's that model is Oh Jin Woo.

00:21:37.772 --> 00:21:40.338
What? Isn't he their model?

00:21:40.338 --> 00:21:42.138
Try!

00:21:42.138 --> 00:21:44.538
That's right. The liquor model got a DUI?

00:21:44.538 --> 00:21:45.872
- Is he insane?
- Jeez.

00:21:45.872 --> 00:21:48.038
Mr. Oh has admitted to all charges.

00:21:48.038 --> 00:21:49.748
[Beer ad model DUI]
And his agency announced

00:21:49.748 --> 00:21:51.772
a full suspension of activities...

00:21:51.772 --> 00:21:53.438
Yes, it's the New Product Development Team.

00:21:53.438 --> 00:21:56.205
You'll need to contact the PR team
for model and promotion inquiries.

00:21:56.205 --> 00:21:58.672
Would you like me to
connect you to the PR team?

00:21:58.672 --> 00:21:59.772
Yes, this is Taehan Liquor.

00:21:59.772 --> 00:22:03.372
We're also currently looking into the matter.

00:22:04.605 --> 00:22:06.472
Could someone take that call?

00:22:11.205 --> 00:22:13.005
Yes, Taehan Liquor Sales Team.

00:22:13.005 --> 00:22:14.972
Yes, well... about that...

00:22:14.972 --> 00:22:18.872
You should contact
the PR team to sort that out.

00:22:18.872 --> 00:22:20.072
We're the Sales Team here.

00:22:20.072 --> 00:22:24.138
Yes, thank you.

00:22:24.138 --> 00:22:26.705
We're swamped.

00:22:30.772 --> 00:22:33.038
Sorry I'm late.

00:22:37.105 --> 00:22:38.838
I'll get straight to the point.

00:22:38.838 --> 00:22:42.438
Do you have a solution for this situation?

00:22:42.438 --> 00:22:43.672
We're working on a solution.

00:22:43.672 --> 00:22:44.905
Working on it?

00:22:44.905 --> 00:22:47.138
Our Southeast Asia exports have collapsed.

00:22:47.138 --> 00:22:50.538
The damages alone are 8 million dollars!

00:22:50.538 --> 00:22:54.038
Does it make sense that Taehan Liquor
is shaking the entire group's stock price?

00:22:54.038 --> 00:22:55.672
First the postpartum
care center beer incident,

00:22:55.672 --> 00:22:58.038
then the new product plagiarism allegations.

00:22:58.038 --> 00:22:59.738
With these back-to-back scandals,

00:22:59.738 --> 00:23:03.005
people are even talking about owner risk now.

00:23:03.005 --> 00:23:04.805
If we can't fix this,

00:23:04.805 --> 00:23:07.397
it'll be hard to keep our footing.

00:23:08.185 --> 00:23:09.189
That's right.

00:23:09.189 --> 00:23:11.072
- That's enough.
- Right.

00:23:14.205 --> 00:23:17.772
The model's DUI didn't happen
because of President Kang.

00:23:17.772 --> 00:23:19.772
Questioning his management skills
over this is...

00:23:19.772 --> 00:23:21.805
He said they're working on a solution.

00:23:21.805 --> 00:23:24.305
Let's give him one more chance.

00:23:39.538 --> 00:23:41.438
Has the CEO of REM Entertainment
responded yet?

00:23:41.438 --> 00:23:44.872
They just notified us they'll join
the entertainment group meeting.

00:23:44.872 --> 00:23:46.638
As they should.

00:23:46.638 --> 00:23:49.072
Betraying me would only hurt them.

00:23:49.072 --> 00:23:52.005
- The time?
- Reserved for 7 p.m.

00:23:52.005 --> 00:23:54.072
Okay.

00:23:54.072 --> 00:23:57.605
This should be enough of a warning.

00:23:57.605 --> 00:24:00.605
People who like drinking often make mistakes.

00:24:00.605 --> 00:24:03.572
The outdoor brands have already
quickly cut ties with Oh Jin Woo.

00:24:03.572 --> 00:24:05.538
Let's replace our model quickly too.

00:24:05.538 --> 00:24:09.172
We can't let our company name
be associated with a DUI offender.

00:24:09.172 --> 00:24:11.772
Did you know there are memes
mocking Try Beer now?

00:24:11.772 --> 00:24:14.172
That's why entertainment companies
are backing out.

00:24:14.172 --> 00:24:15.372
They don't want to be
associated with controversy.

00:24:15.372 --> 00:24:17.238
Did we encourage drinking?

00:24:17.238 --> 00:24:19.338
Honestly, that actor messed up.

00:24:19.338 --> 00:24:20.538
Exactly.

00:24:20.538 --> 00:24:23.672
We built up exports to Southeast Asia
with this Asian Prince branding.

00:24:23.672 --> 00:24:24.672
And this is how he repays us?

00:24:24.672 --> 00:24:29.105
What do we do now? It'd be hard
to find someone with a clean record.

00:24:29.105 --> 00:24:30.238
We have to find someone.

00:24:30.238 --> 00:24:33.705
A new model to revitalize our image.

00:24:33.705 --> 00:24:35.472
Four days should be enough, right?

00:24:35.472 --> 00:24:37.372
Find a new model within four days?

00:24:37.372 --> 00:24:40.405
No. Find one and shoot ads in four days.

00:24:45.605 --> 00:24:47.638
Why is everyone so quiet?

00:24:47.638 --> 00:24:49.005
This is an emergency.

00:24:49.005 --> 00:24:50.838
The conditions are too strict.

00:24:50.838 --> 00:24:53.038
It's not easy to find someone
better than Oh Jin Woo.

00:24:53.038 --> 00:24:54.438
Who did you recommend, Team Leader?

00:24:54.438 --> 00:24:55.738
- Ji Eun Kyu.
- What?

00:24:55.738 --> 00:24:56.772
He's an idol.

00:24:56.772 --> 00:24:58.172
Look at his eyes.

00:24:58.172 --> 00:24:59.372
How pure they are!

00:24:59.372 --> 00:25:02.738
When I look into those eyes,
I feel my soul being cleansed.

00:25:02.738 --> 00:25:05.105
Come on, he's not sexy.

00:25:05.105 --> 00:25:08.072
What then? All the A-list actors
are being blocked by their agencies.

00:25:08.072 --> 00:25:09.438
Does the model really need to be famous?

00:25:09.438 --> 00:25:11.438
Try Beer has many loyal customers,

00:25:11.438 --> 00:25:13.038
so a fresh face might work.

00:25:13.038 --> 00:25:14.105
True.

00:25:14.105 --> 00:25:18.672
Isn't there a sexy man like a bitter stout?

00:25:20.772 --> 00:25:23.438
A sexy man...

00:25:28.672 --> 00:25:30.605
No idea.

00:25:30.605 --> 00:25:32.205
Clueless.

00:25:32.205 --> 00:25:33.638
What should we do?

00:25:33.638 --> 00:25:35.605
See? You have no answers either.

00:25:35.605 --> 00:25:37.938
Kang Du Jun.

00:25:37.938 --> 00:25:41.305
Huh? Did you just say Kang Du Jun?

00:25:41.305 --> 00:25:43.305
- Yes.
- Huh?

00:25:45.772 --> 00:25:47.505
What?

00:25:48.438 --> 00:25:51.372
- Me?
- You just said Kang Du Jun.

00:25:51.372 --> 00:25:53.672
No, that's not what I meant.

00:25:53.672 --> 00:25:55.772
Oh, that's kind of brilliant.

00:25:55.772 --> 00:25:57.805
Crazy. The President as our model?

00:25:57.805 --> 00:26:00.172
But President Kang has that sexy vibe, right?

00:26:00.172 --> 00:26:01.272
No, no.

00:26:01.272 --> 00:26:03.005
I was just spouting nonsense for a second.

00:26:03.005 --> 00:26:04.972
No, it's not bad.

00:26:04.972 --> 00:26:07.738
Since you brought it up, make a proposal too.

00:26:07.738 --> 00:26:08.938
- Me?
- Yes.

00:26:08.938 --> 00:26:10.872
We don't have time if we want
to shoot within four days.

00:26:10.872 --> 00:26:15.138
This is the time to shine,
so our team gets some credit.

00:26:15.138 --> 00:26:17.905
- Right?
- Exactly.

00:26:17.905 --> 00:26:20.638
Having the President as our model!

00:26:22.505 --> 00:26:23.538
Isn't that insane?

00:26:23.538 --> 00:26:26.805
I asked them to find a new model,
and their solution is me? Are you kidding?

00:26:26.805 --> 00:26:27.805
Why not?

00:26:27.805 --> 00:26:29.705
I thought it was perfect
as soon as I heard it.

00:26:29.705 --> 00:26:31.749
Look!

00:26:31.749 --> 00:26:33.972
[Proposal]
The new proposal with you as the model.

00:26:33.972 --> 00:26:37.305
Isn't this exactly the brilliant idea
to turn crisis into opportunity?

00:26:37.305 --> 00:26:39.038
No, forget that. Who did it?

00:26:39.038 --> 00:26:42.505
Seriously, who proposed this ridiculous plan?

00:26:42.505 --> 00:26:44.205
Well...

00:26:48.238 --> 00:26:49.272
It's Manager Jang?

00:26:49.272 --> 00:26:54.505
I brought her as you requested,
so you two can discuss it.

00:27:00.238 --> 00:27:02.605
Surprise!

00:27:03.972 --> 00:27:05.138
What do you think?

00:27:05.138 --> 00:27:08.172
Why not make your debut as a model?

00:27:09.072 --> 00:27:12.772
So, you pictured me as a sexy guy

00:27:12.772 --> 00:27:15.938
like a slightly bitter stout?

00:27:15.938 --> 00:27:17.205
Isn't this practically a confession?

00:27:17.205 --> 00:27:19.305
That's not it.

00:27:19.305 --> 00:27:23.005
It's not? Then fine. I guess I don't
have a reason to do it either.

00:27:23.005 --> 00:27:24.138
Wait, what I meant was...

00:27:24.138 --> 00:27:25.705
Manager Jang is leaving now.

00:27:25.705 --> 00:27:27.438
No, I mean...

00:27:27.438 --> 00:27:30.138
As soon as I heard the concept,

00:27:30.138 --> 00:27:32.872
you were the only person
I thought of, President.

00:27:32.872 --> 00:27:35.572
The more I worked on the proposal,

00:27:35.572 --> 00:27:38.472
the clearer it became that our brand
identity and your image

00:27:38.472 --> 00:27:40.972
are a perfect match.

00:27:42.938 --> 00:27:44.038
[Try Beer]
Look here.

00:27:44.038 --> 00:27:46.872
Try Beer's signature clean, refreshing image

00:27:46.872 --> 00:27:49.905
combined with the new urban,
sophisticated masculinity we're adding...

00:27:49.905 --> 00:27:51.005
Okay.

00:27:51.005 --> 00:27:52.605
Understood.

00:27:52.605 --> 00:27:57.072
Seems like you really
studied me in a short time.

00:27:57.072 --> 00:28:00.972
Well, in that case,
I'll accept, but I have one condition.

00:28:00.972 --> 00:28:02.772
A condition?

00:28:16.538 --> 00:28:18.472
You've been through a lot.

00:28:19.405 --> 00:28:23.405
So I heard he accepted after setting
some kind of condition?

00:28:23.405 --> 00:28:24.405
Yeah, right.

00:28:24.405 --> 00:28:26.172
Agreeing to his condition
should've been enough.

00:28:26.172 --> 00:28:28.405
Why do you have to show up
at the set where he's shooting?

00:28:28.405 --> 00:28:29.472
I'm fine.

00:28:29.472 --> 00:28:31.938
But is the President really okay?

00:28:31.938 --> 00:28:34.472
Yeah, he doesn't look okay at all.

00:28:37.738 --> 00:28:41.538
Where's the brave soul that'll tell him 'no'?

00:28:41.538 --> 00:28:43.205
Alright, President!

00:28:43.205 --> 00:28:47.138
Drink the beer and show us
a joyful expression.

00:28:50.872 --> 00:28:52.338
Oh, gosh.

00:28:52.338 --> 00:28:54.372
Well, just...

00:28:54.372 --> 00:28:56.338
Give us a bright smile.

00:28:56.338 --> 00:28:59.705
Drink the beer, cheer,

00:28:59.705 --> 00:29:01.405
and flash a bright smile.

00:29:01.405 --> 00:29:03.138
Smile.

00:29:03.138 --> 00:29:05.338
Sm... Smile.

00:29:06.372 --> 00:29:07.738
Ugh, jeez.

00:29:07.738 --> 00:29:08.905
What are you all doing?

00:29:08.905 --> 00:29:11.905
Say something!

00:29:11.905 --> 00:29:15.905
Man, even a robot would
smile better than that.

00:29:17.688 --> 00:29:19.305
Oh.

00:29:19.305 --> 00:29:21.338
Let's take a 10-minute break.

00:29:21.338 --> 00:29:23.005
Yes, okay.

00:29:23.005 --> 00:29:25.038
Oh, my.

00:29:25.038 --> 00:29:27.605
Will a break make him smile?

00:29:30.238 --> 00:29:32.372
It's his first time.

00:29:32.372 --> 00:29:34.305
But I'm genuinely curious.

00:29:34.305 --> 00:29:37.338
How much cooler the President
will look all dressed up.

00:29:37.338 --> 00:29:39.138
He'll look like a celebrity, won't he?

00:29:39.138 --> 00:29:40.838
Even as a fellow man, I admit he's handsome.

00:29:40.838 --> 00:29:42.505
Looking at him

00:29:42.505 --> 00:29:44.172
takes me back to my 20s.

00:29:44.172 --> 00:29:47.205
If I dressed up,
I could rival a celebrity too.

00:29:52.272 --> 00:29:54.838
Exactly. If they're shooting at the company,
we should sneak a peek.

00:29:54.838 --> 00:29:56.105
Where's the shoot?

00:29:56.105 --> 00:29:57.372
Team Leader, if it's close, are you going?

00:29:57.372 --> 00:29:58.938
Why not?

00:29:58.938 --> 00:30:00.872
Huh? I got the location from Manager Jang.

00:30:00.872 --> 00:30:01.938
Oh my goodness.

00:30:01.938 --> 00:30:05.405
It'd be great if you put
this much effort in every day.

00:30:05.405 --> 00:30:06.705
It's closer to the office than expected.

00:30:06.705 --> 00:30:08.238
Really? Let's go check it out.

00:30:08.238 --> 00:30:09.538
Can we really go check it out?

00:30:09.538 --> 00:30:12.638
Secretary Go will be with the President,

00:30:12.638 --> 00:30:15.438
so won't Manager Jang feel
left out if no one's with her?

00:30:15.438 --> 00:30:18.372
As teammates, nothing wrong with going.

00:30:18.372 --> 00:30:20.105
So, should I start the car now?

00:30:20.105 --> 00:30:22.672
We can't go empty-handed.
Should we get coffee and dessert?

00:30:22.672 --> 00:30:24.538
There's that new cafe in front of the office.

00:30:24.538 --> 00:30:26.572
Word is their coffee is really good.

00:30:26.572 --> 00:30:27.638
Shall we buy some?

00:30:27.638 --> 00:30:28.972
- Deal!
- Deal.

00:30:28.972 --> 00:30:32.072
But we have to finish the proposal today.

00:30:32.072 --> 00:30:33.438
Is everyone really okay time-wise?

00:30:33.438 --> 00:30:34.672
Oh, right.

00:30:34.672 --> 00:30:36.738
That's why we came in on the weekend.

00:30:36.738 --> 00:30:39.772
If that proposal is the issue,
we'll have to handle it tonight.

00:30:39.772 --> 00:30:41.605
I really want to go too,

00:30:41.605 --> 00:30:44.172
but I have plans with a friend tonight.

00:30:44.172 --> 00:30:46.505
Ugh, my little bunnies at home
are waiting for me.

00:30:46.505 --> 00:30:48.438
I need to rush home
to take over parenting duties.

00:30:48.438 --> 00:30:50.338
I have a book club meeting.

00:30:50.338 --> 00:30:53.438
Tak Soo always seems to
have plans whenever I see him.

00:30:53.438 --> 00:30:56.205
Well, if no one can make it, I'll skip too.

00:30:56.205 --> 00:30:58.105
I guess I should text my crush.

00:30:58.105 --> 00:31:00.305
Ugh, seems like today's just not our day.

00:31:00.305 --> 00:31:02.438
Everyone seems busy this weekend,
so let's wrap this up quickly and go.

00:31:02.438 --> 00:31:04.338
Understood.

00:31:04.338 --> 00:31:07.905
Hey, you're really not going, huh?

00:31:07.905 --> 00:31:10.638
I won't ask twice, okay?

00:31:10.638 --> 00:31:11.838
You're really not going?

00:31:11.838 --> 00:31:14.305
I won't ask thrice.

00:31:27.072 --> 00:31:30.138
But this mirror only shows my nose.

00:31:31.038 --> 00:31:33.738
Restrained emotions naturally
look more sophisticated.

00:31:33.738 --> 00:31:35.005
People just don't get that.

00:31:35.005 --> 00:31:37.172
What's so important
about looking sophisticated?

00:31:37.172 --> 00:31:39.038
It has to feel more real than reality itself.

00:31:39.038 --> 00:31:41.138
Only then will people crave beer
just from seeing the ad.

00:31:41.138 --> 00:31:43.472
I'm not even a real actor.
How am I supposed to do that?

00:31:43.472 --> 00:31:45.638
And can't we replace that director?

00:31:45.638 --> 00:31:47.805
He keeps getting annoyed at everything.

00:31:47.805 --> 00:31:48.805
Watch me.

00:31:48.805 --> 00:31:51.305
Now, imagine you're copying me.

00:31:51.305 --> 00:31:52.805
Make your eyes like shrimp.

00:31:52.805 --> 00:31:55.838
Pull your cheekbones up as high as possible.

00:31:55.838 --> 00:31:58.138
Smile.

00:32:10.172 --> 00:32:11.605
Why aren't you looking at me?

00:32:11.605 --> 00:32:13.105
Now, try it like this.

00:32:13.105 --> 00:32:15.538
Up, up, up.

00:32:15.538 --> 00:32:16.738
That's it.

00:32:16.738 --> 00:32:17.805
Wait, is this really right?

00:32:17.805 --> 00:32:20.372
Earlier you complained I looked like a robot.

00:32:21.372 --> 00:32:23.269
Then watch me.

00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:25.221
Hey!

00:32:26.372 --> 00:32:27.572
Huh? You smiled.

00:32:27.572 --> 00:32:28.638
See? It works.

00:32:28.638 --> 00:32:29.738
You look cool when you smile.

00:32:29.738 --> 00:32:31.072
Now.

00:32:31.072 --> 00:32:32.305
What am I supposed to do?

00:32:32.305 --> 00:32:35.272
Just once, just once.

00:32:36.105 --> 00:32:38.005
Do it just once for me, please.

00:32:38.005 --> 00:32:39.338
What do you mean 'just once'? Forget it.

00:32:39.338 --> 00:32:41.372
Why? Please do it, just once.

00:32:41.372 --> 00:32:42.905
- Just once.
- No.

00:32:42.905 --> 00:32:45.381
- What...
- Just do this once for me.

00:32:45.381 --> 00:32:47.105
Oh, oh.

00:32:47.105 --> 00:32:50.272
Oh, good. Good.

00:32:50.272 --> 00:32:52.272
Okay, okay.

00:32:52.272 --> 00:32:54.372
What happened in that short time?

00:32:54.372 --> 00:32:57.772
So natural! One more time!

00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:02.661
Yeah!

00:33:03.472 --> 00:33:05.438
Good, well done.

00:33:05.438 --> 00:33:07.705
Much better.

00:33:08.905 --> 00:33:11.072
Newborn clothes are this tiny?

00:33:11.072 --> 00:33:14.438
Wow, so adorable.

00:33:14.438 --> 00:33:18.172
But I still don't know Yeol Mu's gender.

00:33:20.997 --> 00:33:25.372
Who cares? Pink works for
both boys and girls.

00:33:25.372 --> 00:33:26.905
Oh my, it's too cute.

00:33:26.905 --> 00:33:28.672
How about this one?

00:33:29.405 --> 00:33:31.972
Hello? Hey, focus, focus.

00:33:31.972 --> 00:33:32.972
You're acting weird today.

00:33:32.972 --> 00:33:34.572
You've been glued to your phone all day.

00:33:34.572 --> 00:33:38.372
She's been at the shoot
for ages, and still no reply?

00:33:38.372 --> 00:33:39.538
Guess she's busy.

00:33:39.538 --> 00:33:41.438
I heard today's shoot is important.

00:33:41.438 --> 00:33:43.505
Aren't you going to pick one?

00:33:43.505 --> 00:33:45.305
You asked me to pick a present for Hui Won.

00:33:45.305 --> 00:33:47.905
This, a pregnancy gift.

00:33:47.905 --> 00:33:49.672
I never said it was a pregnancy gift, though.

00:33:49.672 --> 00:33:51.138
Huh?

00:33:51.138 --> 00:33:55.505
Hey, it's not even her birthday yet.
Should we make up a random holiday to buy it?

00:33:56.338 --> 00:33:58.138
Why? Don't you want to buy it for her?

00:33:58.138 --> 00:34:00.972
No, that's not it.

00:34:02.972 --> 00:34:05.638
Fine, let's take a look.

00:34:05.638 --> 00:34:07.538
See this. Isn't it adorable?

00:34:07.538 --> 00:34:10.105
It even has pockets, look.

00:34:10.105 --> 00:34:12.872
It is kinda cute.

00:34:12.872 --> 00:34:14.772
Why that reaction?

00:34:15.505 --> 00:34:17.538
Then how about this? This is super cute too.

00:34:17.538 --> 00:34:19.438
Check this out.

00:34:19.438 --> 00:34:21.372
Just buy whatever you like.

00:34:21.372 --> 00:34:23.105
Whatever you pick will look pretty anyway.

00:34:23.105 --> 00:34:24.138
Hey, Cha Min Uk.

00:34:24.138 --> 00:34:26.372
Maybe I'm hungry, so I can't focus.

00:34:26.372 --> 00:34:27.705
Shall we grab something to eat?

00:34:27.705 --> 00:34:29.405
Let's go.

00:34:30.505 --> 00:34:33.038
Why's he acting like that today?

00:34:35.605 --> 00:34:37.905
Right, going to the shoot won't help.

00:34:37.905 --> 00:34:38.905
Should be working instead.

00:34:38.905 --> 00:34:40.705
Weekend work isn't new.

00:34:40.705 --> 00:34:43.038
That's just how I am.

00:34:43.038 --> 00:34:45.405
- Oh! You scared me!
- Oh.

00:34:45.405 --> 00:34:47.405
Goodness! What are you doing, Manager Nah?

00:34:47.405 --> 00:34:48.638
You startled me.

00:34:48.638 --> 00:34:49.672
Why'd you come back?

00:34:49.672 --> 00:34:52.772
Well, my wife just called
saying she took the kids to her parents'.

00:34:52.772 --> 00:34:56.572
What? That means you're free!
Isn't that great? Why come back?

00:34:56.572 --> 00:34:59.872
Every day it's chaotic,
but weekends alone feel too lonely.

00:34:59.872 --> 00:35:01.538
Might as well catch up on work.

00:35:01.538 --> 00:35:03.272
Huh? But why aren't you
going home, Team Leader?

00:35:03.272 --> 00:35:04.372
I'm Team Leader Bang.

00:35:04.372 --> 00:35:07.738
Gotta do at least this much
to keep my team leader position.

00:35:10.821 --> 00:35:13.505
Oh my!

00:35:13.505 --> 00:35:16.405
Why are you here, Assistant Manager Choi?

00:35:16.405 --> 00:35:17.938
Now that I think about it,

00:35:17.938 --> 00:35:19.905
Manager Jang and I joined
the company together.

00:35:19.905 --> 00:35:21.372
But I'm still an assistant manager.

00:35:21.372 --> 00:35:24.105
I'm going to work hard
and aim for a promotion.

00:35:24.105 --> 00:35:25.738
Isn't it that your crush hasn't replied?

00:35:25.738 --> 00:35:28.005
No, it's not!

00:35:28.005 --> 00:35:30.238
Didn't you already leave?

00:35:30.238 --> 00:35:33.105
Oh, you scared me!
I left my book club book here.

00:35:33.105 --> 00:35:35.505
I just came back to get this.

00:35:35.505 --> 00:35:38.238
Well, I should get going...

00:35:38.238 --> 00:35:39.938
Get going...

00:35:44.205 --> 00:35:46.705
I think it's okay to slip up once in a while.

00:35:48.165 --> 00:35:50.272
Huh? Why are you still here?

00:35:50.272 --> 00:35:52.805
The main character always shows up last.

00:35:52.805 --> 00:35:54.138
The future of our Taehan Liquor.

00:35:54.138 --> 00:35:56.738
I knew you'd come back.

00:35:56.738 --> 00:35:58.938
Look at how tight our team is.

00:35:58.938 --> 00:36:00.138
Gives me chills.

00:36:00.138 --> 00:36:01.438
Well, yes.

00:36:01.438 --> 00:36:03.938
We are the future of Taehan Liquor.

00:36:03.938 --> 00:36:07.205
I'm feeling generous. Coffee's on me today!

00:36:07.205 --> 00:36:08.405
What's the occasion?

00:36:08.405 --> 00:36:11.305
You used to stretch every penny
raising three kids.

00:36:11.305 --> 00:36:13.272
On a day like today,
how could I not buy coffee?

00:36:13.272 --> 00:36:14.838
Tak Soo! That coffee shop earlier.

00:36:14.838 --> 00:36:16.105
- Yes.

Yes, I'll get you there safely.

to pull out your card in front of a senior?

I'm buying today.

So there's no need to bother
contacting our model

00:53:16.205 --> 00:53:19.438
or giving pocket money to the agencies.

00:53:19.438 --> 00:53:21.038
Okay.

00:53:21.038 --> 00:53:24.472
Let's bury the past nicely.

00:53:24.472 --> 00:53:26.305
Jang Hui Won.

00:53:26.305 --> 00:53:28.438
How are things with that woman these days?

00:53:29.172 --> 00:53:31.805
Your parents don't know yet.

00:53:32.572 --> 00:53:37.205
They'd be thrilled if they knew their son
got someone pregnant before marriage.

00:53:38.772 --> 00:53:42.072
But do the employees know
that Hui Won is pregnant?

00:53:42.072 --> 00:53:43.372
Well, anyone can get pregnant.

00:53:43.372 --> 00:53:45.372
What matters is whose child it is.

00:53:45.372 --> 00:53:47.205
That's enough.

00:53:51.272 --> 00:53:52.872
Still, she must feel relieved.

00:53:52.872 --> 00:53:56.472
When Hui Won is having a hard time,
you can just hold her hand.

00:53:57.605 --> 00:53:59.505
Well.

00:53:59.505 --> 00:54:00.938
If it gets tough this time,

00:54:00.938 --> 00:54:03.738
will you let go of her hand again?

00:54:04.905 --> 00:54:06.638
Like last time?

00:54:25.205 --> 00:54:28.638
I've put salt
in the second drawer, so use it.

00:54:28.638 --> 00:54:29.805
Are you okay?

00:54:29.805 --> 00:54:30.805
I'm okay.

00:54:30.805 --> 00:54:32.272
Did President Han say something again?

00:54:32.272 --> 00:54:36.005
She always comes without notice, seriously.

00:54:36.005 --> 00:54:37.838
It's nothing.

00:54:37.838 --> 00:54:40.238
What time is the buyer meeting?

00:54:40.238 --> 00:54:41.272
In 30 minutes.

00:54:41.272 --> 00:54:42.972
Are you sure you're okay?

00:54:42.972 --> 00:54:44.472
I'm okay.

00:54:44.472 --> 00:54:46.572
You go first. I'll be there soon.

00:55:18.821 --> 00:55:20.072
[Global partnership between

00:55:20.072 --> 00:55:21.405
Nice to meet you.

I'm glad we can collaborate like this.

00:55:23.038 --> 00:55:24.372
Nice to meet you.

00:55:24.372 --> 00:55:26.605
I'm glad we can collaborate like this.

00:55:26.605 --> 00:55:28.672

I'm very happy too.

00:55:35.938 --> 00:55:38.672
If it gets tough this time,
will you let go of her hand again?

00:55:38.672 --> 00:55:40.405
Like last time?

00:55:49.005 --> 00:55:50.738
President?

[Global partnership between
Taehan Liquor and JINSH Co]

00:55:59.805 --> 00:56:01.572
No problem.

00:56:11.738 --> 00:56:13.538
Don't let go.

00:56:13.538 --> 00:56:16.272
Don't give up, please, brother.

00:56:16.272 --> 00:56:18.472
Brother, please.

00:56:18.472 --> 00:56:20.172
Brother! No!

00:56:21.538 --> 00:56:23.525
What do I do?

00:56:26.338 --> 00:56:27.772
Will you let go of her hand again?

00:56:27.772 --> 00:56:29.472
Like last time?

00:57:08.638 --> 00:57:11.738
President, are you not feeling well?

00:57:14.605 --> 00:57:16.672
You are burning.

00:57:16.672 --> 00:57:20.038
If you feel dizzy, maybe lean on me?

00:58:41.733 --> 00:58:43.813
[Epilogue]

00:58:47.272 --> 00:58:48.705
Oh, you startled me!

00:58:48.705 --> 00:58:49.772
Why are you so surprised?

00:58:49.772 --> 00:58:50.972
Why are you so late?

00:58:50.972 --> 00:58:52.705
There's a meeting in 20 minutes!

00:58:52.705 --> 00:58:55.038
I didn't want to be late.

00:58:55.038 --> 00:58:57.438
When I go outside now,
people won't leave me alone.

00:58:57.438 --> 00:58:58.472
But they leave you alone just fine.

00:58:58.472 --> 00:59:00.105
You don't know how the world works, do you?

00:59:00.105 --> 00:59:03.605
If I go outside, there are
people recognizing me now.

00:59:03.605 --> 00:59:06.538
Manager Jang just happened to see that.

00:59:07.538 --> 00:59:10.872
Oh, thrilling. Feels so new.

00:59:10.872 --> 00:59:12.438
Are you excited about getting fans?

00:59:12.438 --> 00:59:14.805
Or are you excited because Manager Jang
saw and got jealous?

00:59:14.805 --> 00:59:17.305
A tall figure like this can't be hidden.

00:59:17.305 --> 00:59:20.205
With that nose bridge and those deep eyes,

00:59:20.205 --> 00:59:21.738
they're truly one of a kind.

00:59:21.738 --> 00:59:24.772
That's what Manager Jang said.

00:59:25.805 --> 00:59:27.172
Goodness.

00:59:27.172 --> 00:59:30.205
You were all like 'who on earth
came up with this idea?'

00:59:30.205 --> 00:59:31.472
And now you're looking so happy.

00:59:31.472 --> 00:59:35.838
And what exactly did you
make Manager Jang promise?

00:59:35.838 --> 00:59:38.005
You don't need to know.

00:59:38.005 --> 00:59:41.438
By the way, where did this mirror
come from? I can only see my nose.

00:59:41.438 --> 00:59:42.472
Hey, that's mine.

00:59:42.472 --> 00:59:46.072
It's yours? Even your mirror's
a mini version of you.

00:59:47.493 --> 00:59:50.238
Jeez. If you model twice, it's really
going to be a big deal.

00:59:50.238 --> 00:59:51.472
Oh, right.

00:59:51.472 --> 00:59:53.772
Can you get me a hat and mask?

00:59:53.772 --> 00:59:56.405
- Why?
- What if people recognize me?

00:59:56.405 --> 00:59:58.938
Manager Jang said that again.

01:00:00.038 --> 01:00:02.105
You're so annoying.

01:00:03.938 --> 01:00:05.638
Give it to me.

01:00:44.272 --> 01:00:45.738
It's almost time to get off work.

01:00:45.738 --> 01:00:46.981
Do you like Jang Hui Won?

01:00:46.981 --> 01:00:48.037
Is that not allowed?

01:00:48.037 --> 01:00:49.805
Are you trying to pick a fight right now?

01:00:49.805 --> 01:00:51.972
You keep acting childish
while competing with the President.

01:00:51.972 --> 01:00:53.005
You've been acting strange lately.

01:00:53.005 --> 01:00:55.305
- Get out.
- Do you really not know why I'm like this?

01:00:55.305 --> 01:00:56.905
Give me Taehan Liquor.

01:00:56.905 --> 01:00:58.038
What if I say no?

01:00:58.038 --> 01:01:01.572
You'll see for yourself why you
have no choice but to say yes.

01:01:01.572 --> 01:01:03.138
It's a safe and reliable place.

01:01:03.138 --> 01:01:04.572
I told you I'm keeping this baby.

01:01:04.572 --> 01:01:06.105
A shameful secret
I never want anyone to know?

01:01:06.105 --> 01:01:07.305
That's the kind of relationship it is.

01:01:07.305 --> 01:01:11.172
For me, that day was really wonderful.
