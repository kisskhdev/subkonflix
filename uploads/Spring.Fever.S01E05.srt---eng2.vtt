00:01:13.012 --> 00:01:13.846
Team White?

00:01:15.556 --> 00:01:16.849
1 HOUR AGO

00:01:16.932 --> 00:01:19.935
I'm resigning as parent rep
for Team White.

00:01:20.686 --> 00:01:21.604
You're resigning?

00:01:23.814 --> 00:01:24.857
Yes.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.110
I hurt my knee
while chopping wood the other day,

00:01:28.611 --> 00:01:30.446
so Dong-pyo's grandma will fill in for me.

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:32.656
Listen, I may not look it,

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.785
but I was on the relay team
at Shinsu Primary School back in 1967.

00:01:37.411 --> 00:01:40.289
I almost made it
to the National Sports Festival.

00:01:40.372 --> 00:01:42.249
Don't worry about a thing.

00:01:42.791 --> 00:01:43.792
In 1967?

00:01:44.585 --> 00:01:45.753
When I was 12.

00:01:48.505 --> 00:01:49.673
I see. (Support Admin Watch on

00:01:54.637 --> 00:01:57.431
30 MINUTES AGO

00:01:59.058 --> 00:02:02.394
It's time to unleash
my Story Slayer skills.

00:02:05.397 --> 00:02:09.443
Mr. Hong, what do you think justice means?

00:02:10.444 --> 00:02:11.278
Justice?

00:02:12.655 --> 00:02:13.864
"Justice."

00:02:13.948 --> 00:02:16.742
"Fiat justitia ruat caelum."

00:02:17.368 --> 00:02:19.787
"Let justice be done,
though the heavens fall."

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.330
That's what Kant said.

00:02:21.413 --> 00:02:25.668
In other words, following the rules
shouldn't depend on the situation.

00:02:25.751 --> 00:02:27.795
It's a virtue that must be practiced

00:02:27.878 --> 00:02:29.880
no matter how bad
the consequences might be.

00:02:29.964 --> 00:02:33.175
I drew this white ball
in front of the students.

00:02:33.258 --> 00:02:36.720
But to reverse that decision just because
it disadvantages your team?

00:02:36.804 --> 00:02:39.765
That violates the very rules
we established ourselves.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.226
Wow.

00:02:44.186 --> 00:02:45.479
Were you always this smart?

00:02:45.562 --> 00:02:48.941
You're always so quiet. I had no idea.

00:02:49.692 --> 00:02:52.277
You've got a way with words.

00:02:52.861 --> 00:02:55.906
Now then, I'll get straight to the point.

00:02:57.074 --> 00:02:58.158
I, Yoon Bom, will remain

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:00.494
on Team White as originally decided.

00:03:01.412 --> 00:03:05.290
This decision isn't for any other reason.

00:03:05.374 --> 00:03:07.292
It's because, as an ethics teacher,

00:03:07.376 --> 00:03:09.962
I need to show my students
what real justice looks like--

00:03:10.546 --> 00:03:12.256
Sure. Go ahead, then.

00:03:16.093 --> 00:03:16.927
Sorry?

00:03:17.553 --> 00:03:18.971
Fine, have it your way.

00:03:27.312 --> 00:03:30.065
Team White, are you ready to win?

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:30.983
Let's go!

00:03:31.066 --> 00:03:32.901
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

00:03:38.532 --> 00:03:40.242
Hey, Sun Han-gyul.

00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:45.080
Did you seriously play me?

00:03:45.831 --> 00:03:46.832
No. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:03:47.458 --> 00:03:49.793
Se-jin clearly said
Ms. Bom was on Team Blue.

00:03:49.877 --> 00:03:51.128
Here we go. Let's do this.

00:03:51.211 --> 00:03:53.213
-Let's go, Team White!
-There you go!

00:03:53.297 --> 00:03:54.757
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.758
Let's go.

00:04:00.596 --> 00:04:01.722
What's going on?

00:04:01.805 --> 00:04:04.016
Didn't you say your teacher
was on Team Blue?

00:04:05.184 --> 00:04:07.978
Who cares if she's on Team Blue or White?

00:04:08.562 --> 00:04:10.731
There's only one thing
you need to care about.

00:04:10.814 --> 00:04:12.066
Me. Don't you know that?

00:04:13.108 --> 00:04:15.694
I just thought you were both on Team Blue,

00:04:15.778 --> 00:04:18.906
so I was going to do everything
to help you both win.

00:04:19.698 --> 00:04:20.741
-Nope.
-Warm up.

00:04:20.824 --> 00:04:22.993
I'm hoping she loses.

00:04:23.494 --> 00:04:24.369
Your hands too.

00:04:25.037 --> 00:04:26.413
-Watch your wrists.
-Do you know

00:04:26.497 --> 00:04:28.749
why she came down here from Seoul?

00:04:29.458 --> 00:04:30.542
How do you know?

00:04:31.251 --> 00:04:33.545
What the heck? How do you know?

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:35.881
Did Dad tell you?

00:04:35.964 --> 00:04:38.425
So I had Secretary Jung look into it,

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:42.429
and there's a reason why Se-jin's teacher
volunteered to come here from Seoul.

00:04:42.513 --> 00:04:44.139
Why? What happened?

00:04:44.223 --> 00:04:47.267
It seems like she had some issues
with a man.

00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:49.019
What? Unbelievable.

00:04:49.103 --> 00:04:49.937
Oh, right.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.900
Apparently she's
actress Jeong Nan-hee's daughter.

00:04:55.734 --> 00:04:58.654
That explains it.
I thought she was pretty.

00:05:00.239 --> 00:05:02.533
So what is it? What did she do wrong?

00:05:02.616 --> 00:05:04.827
Gosh, it's nasty.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.037
Something with a parent,
that kind of thing.

00:05:07.121 --> 00:05:08.831
Oh, my goodness.

00:05:09.998 --> 00:05:12.751
Don't tell anyone what you just said.

00:05:13.335 --> 00:05:14.336
Got it?

00:05:15.796 --> 00:05:17.422
Then you have to win.

00:05:18.924 --> 00:05:21.927
Let me beat Evil Han-gyul,

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.471
and I'll do whatever you say.

00:05:28.433 --> 00:05:29.309
Okay.

00:05:29.935 --> 00:05:32.104
Now, let's kick off
Shinsu High's sports festival

00:05:32.187 --> 00:05:34.231
with the first event.

00:05:34.314 --> 00:05:37.568
First up is the relay race.
Isn't this exciting already?

00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:40.154
Absolutely. Keep an eye
on Oh Dong-pyo from Team White,

00:05:40.237 --> 00:05:41.655
a 12-second 100-meter sprinter.

00:05:41.738 --> 00:05:44.491
Choi Se-jin from Team Blue,
who runs 100 meters in 15 seconds.

00:05:44.575 --> 00:05:46.702
Oh Dong-pyo's grandmother, Yang Bok-hee,

00:05:46.785 --> 00:05:48.787
is in the race,
as Team White's parent rep.

00:05:48.871 --> 00:05:52.374
We've got Sun Han-gyul,
our school's top student,

00:05:52.457 --> 00:05:55.252
and Yoon Bom, the faculty's
young up-and-coming ethics teacher.

00:05:55.335 --> 00:05:56.503
TEAM WHITE

00:05:56.587 --> 00:05:58.380
Team White's lineup is spectacular.

00:05:58.463 --> 00:06:00.132
Team Blue also has a strong lineup.

00:06:00.215 --> 00:06:02.801
Hong Jung-pyo, science teacher
and Director of Academics.

00:06:02.885 --> 00:06:05.053
Kim Min-guk, Shinsu High's prankster,

00:06:05.137 --> 00:06:07.973
and Seo Hye-suk, parent representative,
who teaches Korean.

00:06:08.056 --> 00:06:09.099
TEAM BLUE

00:06:09.183 --> 00:06:11.059
You never know who'll win until it's over.

00:06:11.143 --> 00:06:13.979
That's why not giving up
until the last second

00:06:14.062 --> 00:06:15.564
can be a key strategy.

00:06:15.647 --> 00:06:16.565
That's right.

00:06:43.217 --> 00:06:45.052
What's all this?

00:06:45.135 --> 00:06:48.388
Do you think this is the Olympic finals
or something?

00:06:48.472 --> 00:06:49.556
What?

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.558
Do I look too cool
for you to recognize me?

00:06:59.107 --> 00:07:01.818
Relay runners, come forward!

00:07:05.656 --> 00:07:06.823
Let's go.

00:07:07.741 --> 00:07:08.575
What?

00:07:09.785 --> 00:07:13.372
Just because the situation's changed
doesn't mean our promise changes.

00:07:14.331 --> 00:07:15.290
I am

00:07:15.916 --> 00:07:17.209
counting on you, Uncle.

00:07:18.752 --> 00:07:19.962
Han-gyul, about me not--

00:07:20.045 --> 00:07:21.296
Oh, dear. Wait.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:26.343
You hurt your leg chopping wood.
Why are you out here?

00:07:26.426 --> 00:07:28.637
Leave the parent rep job to me

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.266
and go rest in the stands. Now!

00:07:32.349 --> 00:07:33.183
Go on!

00:07:33.267 --> 00:07:35.560
-Wait, but...
-Let's step off the field.

00:07:35.644 --> 00:07:37.938
-But--
-Come on, it's starting.

00:07:38.438 --> 00:07:40.565
Ms. Bom. I...

00:07:40.649 --> 00:07:41.650
-Hey.
-Come on.

00:07:41.733 --> 00:07:43.735
Did I hear that wrong?

00:07:43.819 --> 00:07:46.154
-First runner...
-Dong-pyo's grandma is running?

00:07:46.238 --> 00:07:47.656
-Take position!
-You got this!

00:07:48.573 --> 00:07:49.449
Ms. Bom.

00:07:50.075 --> 00:07:53.370
"Fiat justitia ruat caelum," right?

00:07:54.121 --> 00:07:55.622
Let's give it our all and run.

00:07:55.706 --> 00:07:58.333
Let's see if justice will be done.

00:07:58.417 --> 00:07:59.626
Geez, let's just watch.

00:08:00.294 --> 00:08:01.169
Go, Han-gyul!

00:08:01.253 --> 00:08:02.379
On your marks...

00:08:06.508 --> 00:08:10.095
His uncle is... not participating?

00:08:12.806 --> 00:08:13.640
Go!

00:08:13.724 --> 00:08:14.891
Yoon Bom's start was late.

00:08:14.975 --> 00:08:16.101
Go!

00:08:16.685 --> 00:08:19.855
Wow, Hong Jung-pyo's off to a great start.

00:08:19.938 --> 00:08:22.524
He's not letting
the young Yoon Bom get ahead at all.

00:08:25.193 --> 00:08:26.111
Swing your arms!

00:08:34.328 --> 00:08:36.121
Yoon Bom is picking up speed now.

00:08:36.955 --> 00:08:38.248
Run!

00:08:38.332 --> 00:08:39.833
She's making a move for the lead!

00:08:40.417 --> 00:08:43.837
Here comes Yoon Bom!

00:08:47.632 --> 00:08:48.925
No.

00:08:49.009 --> 00:08:50.010
Hey, look!

00:08:50.093 --> 00:08:51.053
Foul!

00:08:51.136 --> 00:08:53.388
Hong Jung-pyo, that's not right.

00:08:53.472 --> 00:08:54.348
Foul!

00:08:54.431 --> 00:08:58.477
What's happening?
Yoon Bom's form has collapsed.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.772
Hong Jung-pyo is pulling ahead again.

00:09:01.855 --> 00:09:03.106
Seriously, dang it!

00:09:04.733 --> 00:09:06.485
Seriously?

00:09:06.568 --> 00:09:11.615
And there it is. Seo Hye-suk
and Yang Bok-hee got the batons.

00:09:11.698 --> 00:09:12.908
It's Dong-pyo's grandma.

00:09:12.991 --> 00:09:14.117
-Ma'am.
-Ma'am.

00:09:14.201 --> 00:09:15.994
SUN HAN-GYUL,
THE BEST IN THE UNIVERSE

00:09:16.078 --> 00:09:16.912
-Ma'am.
-Oh, ma'am.

00:09:16.995 --> 00:09:18.789
What? Ma'am.

00:09:20.248 --> 00:09:21.166
Oh, no.

00:09:21.249 --> 00:09:22.793
What's happening here?

00:09:22.876 --> 00:09:26.254
Is Yang Bok-hee really going
at full speed?

00:09:26.338 --> 00:09:30.258
Is Team White losing
yet another chance to take the lead?

00:09:30.342 --> 00:09:32.886
Go! Faster!

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.472
What are you going to do, Evil Han-Gyul?

00:09:35.555 --> 00:09:37.599
Looks like I'll be cutting
the finish ribbon.

00:09:38.266 --> 00:09:39.893
-Now, the third runners...
-Let's go.

00:09:39.976 --> 00:09:41.395
...are getting ready.

00:09:41.478 --> 00:09:43.230
Han-gyul, go.

00:09:44.981 --> 00:09:45.941
Let's go.

00:09:46.566 --> 00:09:48.151
Ma'am, pass it to Han-gyul.

00:09:51.488 --> 00:09:52.447
Run!

00:09:52.531 --> 00:09:53.990
Han-gyul!

00:09:54.074 --> 00:09:55.575
-Run!
-Let's go!

00:09:55.659 --> 00:09:56.785
ALREADY A WINNER IN LOOKS

00:09:56.868 --> 00:09:58.662
-Why is he that fast?
-Wait.

00:09:58.745 --> 00:10:01.206
-Sun Han-gyul!
-Sun Han-gyul!

00:10:01.289 --> 00:10:02.290
What's this?

00:10:02.374 --> 00:10:06.461
Sun Han-gyul
is catching up to Kim Min-guk.

00:10:06.545 --> 00:10:08.046
Sun Han-gyul, you drive me crazy!

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:09.840
You've settled in my heart!

00:10:09.923 --> 00:10:11.758
Sun Han-gyul, you drive me crazy!

00:10:11.842 --> 00:10:13.552
You've settled in my heart!

00:10:13.635 --> 00:10:15.137
Sun Han-gyul, you drive me crazy!

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.596
You've settled in my heart!

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.433
Sun Han-gyul's really driving us crazy.

00:10:19.516 --> 00:10:21.309
He's ruthless to the opposing team.

00:10:21.393 --> 00:10:24.062
Oh, is this a comeback?

00:10:24.771 --> 00:10:26.022
A comeback!

00:10:26.106 --> 00:10:29.192
-Sun Han-gyul takes the lead!
-He's ahead!

00:10:30.527 --> 00:10:31.862
You got this!

00:10:32.696 --> 00:10:33.738
Run!

00:10:34.281 --> 00:10:35.198
Han-gyul.

00:10:35.282 --> 00:10:36.283
Here.

00:10:44.332 --> 00:10:46.585
What just happened?

00:10:46.668 --> 00:10:49.838
The baton flew away!

00:10:58.138 --> 00:10:59.347
You asked me last time

00:11:00.765 --> 00:11:04.144
if my intentions were good or evil.

00:11:05.479 --> 00:11:10.150
Once the sports festival ends,
you'll know the answer.

00:11:15.947 --> 00:11:17.741
GO, TEAM BLUE!
TEAM BLUE HAN-GYUL

00:11:53.944 --> 00:11:54.945
Hey.

00:11:55.904 --> 00:11:57.280
That dog...

00:11:57.364 --> 00:11:59.032
I can't believe this.

00:11:59.616 --> 00:12:01.326
-Se-jin, hurry!
-Go!

00:12:01.409 --> 00:12:03.787
Whose dog is that?

00:12:05.121 --> 00:12:06.456
CAPTAIN

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.543
Let go! Hey, drop it!

00:12:09.626 --> 00:12:10.627
Let go, you fool!

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:12.337
Dong-pyo, what are you doing?

00:12:13.547 --> 00:12:14.673
Let go.

00:12:15.757 --> 00:12:18.468
Run, Dong-pyo! Go, Dong-pyo!

00:12:18.552 --> 00:12:20.845
Finally, Oh Dong-pyo got the baton

00:12:20.929 --> 00:12:23.557
and is chasing Choi Se-jin.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.559
Faster! Swing your arms!

00:12:25.642 --> 00:12:28.395
But it'll be tough
to catch up to Choi Se-jin.

00:12:28.478 --> 00:12:29.521
You got this, Se-jin!

00:12:36.319 --> 00:12:37.529
That's right.

00:12:37.612 --> 00:12:40.365
Choi Se-jin crosses the finish line

00:12:40.448 --> 00:12:43.785
and claims victory!

00:12:46.454 --> 00:12:48.707
I-jun, I won!

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:50.917
I crushed Evil Han-gyul!

00:12:58.967 --> 00:13:00.343
Good job, kiddo.

00:13:06.099 --> 00:13:07.100
Han-gyul.

00:13:07.183 --> 00:13:09.311
How was I supposed
to take the baton like that?

00:13:09.394 --> 00:13:12.480
How could you not catch that thing?

00:13:12.564 --> 00:13:15.275
I told you to keep your eyes
on the baton during practice.

00:13:15.358 --> 00:13:17.819
You've really got some nerve saying that.

00:13:17.902 --> 00:13:19.863
Oh, gosh.

00:13:21.031 --> 00:13:22.032
Are you okay?

00:13:22.115 --> 00:13:25.243
It looks like my artificial joints
are completely messed up.

00:13:26.328 --> 00:13:29.497
I don't think I can run anymore.

00:13:31.708 --> 00:13:33.335
Stop scaring people here.

00:13:33.418 --> 00:13:35.879
Go somewhere else and calm down, okay?

00:13:36.671 --> 00:13:38.715
Please, I have to go now.

00:13:40.592 --> 00:13:43.511
What a thrilling start
from the first event.

00:13:43.595 --> 00:13:44.888
That's right.

00:13:44.971 --> 00:13:46.806
I can't wait for the next event.

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:47.891
That's right.

00:13:47.974 --> 00:13:50.644
With that, Team Blue takes the point
in the first relay event.

00:13:50.727 --> 00:13:51.561
TEAM BLUE

00:13:51.645 --> 00:13:54.648
We'll take a short break and be back
after the commercials.

00:13:54.731 --> 00:13:57.275
You're watching
Shinsu High's sports festival,

00:13:57.359 --> 00:13:59.653
filled with passion,

00:13:59.736 --> 00:14:02.322
here at the Shinsu High School main field.

00:14:02.405 --> 00:14:03.907
SHINSU HIGH
GOVERNOR CHOI CHANG-WOO

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:05.408
-Good work.
-Good work.

00:14:27.305 --> 00:14:28.181
Bom.

00:14:28.264 --> 00:14:30.850
See? The whole thing
about your knee injury was a lie.

00:14:32.852 --> 00:14:33.853
Bom.

00:14:35.605 --> 00:14:37.482
I had to lie because--

00:14:38.149 --> 00:14:39.609
Probably because of me.

00:14:40.735 --> 00:14:41.569
How did you know?

00:14:41.653 --> 00:14:43.238
Mr. Sun.

00:14:43.321 --> 00:14:45.824
Can't you keep
personal feelings out of this?

00:14:45.907 --> 00:14:49.411
Even if there was tension between us,
that shouldn't hurt the team.

00:14:49.494 --> 00:14:50.578
Gosh.

00:14:51.246 --> 00:14:52.789
That's not the reason.

00:14:53.373 --> 00:14:57.293
Of course,
I may have lost my temper with you.

00:14:57.377 --> 00:14:58.837
I admit that.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.047
But there was a good reason

00:15:01.798 --> 00:15:03.508
for me to act that way.

00:15:04.759 --> 00:15:06.761
What is the reason?

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:11.474
You want to know?

00:15:12.142 --> 00:15:12.976
Yes.

00:15:13.685 --> 00:15:17.522
Then... win the medal for Bom-sik.

00:15:18.481 --> 00:15:21.693
I'll tell you why
on the day Bom-sik gets the medal.

00:15:31.661 --> 00:15:34.998
Just because the situation's changed
doesn't mean our promise changes.

00:15:36.541 --> 00:15:37.834
No.

00:15:40.003 --> 00:15:43.381
Are you going to break the promise
you made to Bom-sik as his dad?

00:15:45.467 --> 00:15:46.301
Bom.

00:15:47.135 --> 00:15:48.636
Look, I'm Sun Jae-gyu.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:51.765
When I promise something,
I stick to it, no matter what.

00:15:51.848 --> 00:15:52.766
But?

00:15:53.975 --> 00:15:54.809
But...

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:58.438
the promises got all twisted.

00:15:58.521 --> 00:16:01.858
If I keep this one, it breaks the other,
and vice versa.

00:16:01.941 --> 00:16:04.235
It's driving me crazy, you know?

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.157
If that's your final decision...

00:16:10.283 --> 00:16:11.117
I get it.

00:16:14.329 --> 00:16:16.080
Wait, Bom.

00:16:20.168 --> 00:16:21.503
-What are you doing?
-Oh, my.

00:16:21.586 --> 00:16:22.962
What's wrong with me?

00:16:23.046 --> 00:16:25.131
Maybe I pushed myself too hard
in the relay.

00:16:26.925 --> 00:16:30.887
Since my legs have given out already,
I'll say a few things like this.

00:16:36.434 --> 00:16:38.728
Dong-pyo's grandmother's dream

00:16:38.812 --> 00:16:41.439
was to be a relay runner
at the National Sports Festival.

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.903
The 12-year-old girl
wanted to wear a medal

00:16:46.986 --> 00:16:48.822
around her neck someday.

00:16:50.031 --> 00:16:51.699
After all these years,

00:16:52.617 --> 00:16:54.077
she now has artificial joints

00:16:55.453 --> 00:16:57.872
and can't even run freely anymore.

00:17:00.792 --> 00:17:04.712
Don't you want to put a medal...

00:17:06.172 --> 00:17:08.758
around that girl's neck?

00:17:11.803 --> 00:17:13.346
Please don't crush...

00:17:14.931 --> 00:17:16.307
Ms. Yang Bok-hee's dream...

00:17:19.561 --> 00:17:21.646
that she's held on to for 70 years.

00:17:24.691 --> 00:17:25.567
Please?

00:17:29.779 --> 00:17:30.613
I am...

00:17:32.615 --> 00:17:33.825
counting on you, Uncle.

00:17:39.664 --> 00:17:41.749
I can't.

00:17:44.335 --> 00:17:45.503
Darn it.

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:48.214
Gosh.

00:17:50.466 --> 00:17:52.552
Last time, for real.
It's really the last time.

00:17:53.344 --> 00:17:55.972
Let me say just one last thing,
and I'll be out of your way.

00:18:01.561 --> 00:18:04.314
PLEASE FIND MY DAUGHTER
COMING TO THEATERS THIS MAY

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:07.775
I have a question for you, Ji-woo.

00:18:07.859 --> 00:18:10.486
How was it working
with actress Choi Jeong-hee?

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:14.991
We really clicked, like childhood friends.

00:18:15.074 --> 00:18:16.326
You can look forward to it.

00:18:16.409 --> 00:18:17.785
Ms. Jeong Nan-hee.

00:18:18.995 --> 00:18:19.829
Yes, go ahead.

00:18:19.913 --> 00:18:21.998
This is your first project in five years.

00:18:22.081 --> 00:18:25.501
Was there a particular reason
your big screen comeback took so long?

00:18:25.585 --> 00:18:27.629
Among all the scripts coming in,

00:18:27.712 --> 00:18:30.673
it's not easy to find one
that really feels right for me.

00:18:31.549 --> 00:18:33.259
As I read the script,

00:18:33.801 --> 00:18:37.305
it reminded me of everything
I shared with my daughter.

00:18:37.388 --> 00:18:41.768
It all felt like my own story,
so I had no reason to turn it down.

00:18:41.851 --> 00:18:43.561
Speaking of your daughter,

00:18:44.687 --> 00:18:48.191
didn't she teach
at Munsong High School in Gangnam?

00:18:48.775 --> 00:18:49.817
Not sure if you heard,

00:18:49.901 --> 00:18:53.071
but there was a small incident
at Munsong High last year.

00:18:53.863 --> 00:18:55.949
In class, a parent and a female teacher--

00:18:56.032 --> 00:18:58.785
Please DM me for personal questions.

00:18:59.994 --> 00:19:04.874
I feel a little uncomfortable taking away
attention from the other actors.

00:19:07.126 --> 00:19:11.005
Does anyone have a question
for the director?

00:19:11.089 --> 00:19:13.174
Yes, I have a question for the director.

00:19:13.675 --> 00:19:16.678
Your last film was loved
by eight million people...

00:19:22.517 --> 00:19:23.559
All right.

00:19:30.984 --> 00:19:31.985
TEACHERS' OFFICE

00:19:45.456 --> 00:19:47.959
She should make sure to eat properly.

00:20:10.732 --> 00:20:13.276
Running around on an empty stomach
isn't good for you.

00:20:13.359 --> 00:20:15.111
Make sure you eat your meals.

00:20:25.955 --> 00:20:28.041
It tastes exactly
like what I was looking for.

00:20:29.042 --> 00:20:31.794
Especially the bittersweet aftertaste.

00:20:31.878 --> 00:20:34.839
No restaurant has recreated that taste.

00:20:36.007 --> 00:20:38.342
Seriously? You'll give me
the secret recipe?

00:20:59.697 --> 00:21:02.784
Now, the players from both teams
are entering the field.

00:21:02.867 --> 00:21:06.370
If Team Blue wins the tug-of-war,
they take the victory.

00:21:06.454 --> 00:21:07.288
That's right.

00:21:07.371 --> 00:21:10.541
Except for soccer,
Team Blue got every point.

00:21:12.293 --> 00:21:14.420
This contest is really important
for Team White.

00:21:16.255 --> 00:21:18.466
Jjun, pull yourself together.

00:21:19.342 --> 00:21:21.511
Why are you so out of it? Jjun?

00:21:23.137 --> 00:21:25.598
I was briefly confused
about which line to get in.

00:21:26.933 --> 00:21:28.726
Now it's all clear.

00:21:35.191 --> 00:21:37.735
Everyone, take your positions
like we practiced!

00:21:38.319 --> 00:21:39.153
To positions!

00:21:40.196 --> 00:21:41.656
To positions!

00:21:44.158 --> 00:21:48.329
Let's forget about the ones who left.
Let's do our best until the end.

00:21:48.412 --> 00:21:49.247
Let's go!

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:51.040
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

00:22:06.347 --> 00:22:09.183
RODIN'S THE THINKER

00:22:09.267 --> 00:22:11.686
Last time, for real.
It's really the last time.

00:22:12.562 --> 00:22:15.189
Let me say just one last thing,
and I'll be out of your way.

00:22:16.983 --> 00:22:18.651
I actually came here

00:22:19.569 --> 00:22:22.697
not because of Bom-sik, or the kids...

00:22:23.823 --> 00:22:25.491
or Dong-pyo's grandmother.

00:22:29.996 --> 00:22:30.872
I...

00:22:33.457 --> 00:22:35.001
need you, Mr. Sun.

00:22:44.218 --> 00:22:45.219
Say that again,

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:47.430
one more time.

00:22:47.513 --> 00:22:49.724
Last time, for real.
It's really the last time.

00:22:49.807 --> 00:22:51.392
No, not that part.

00:22:53.603 --> 00:22:54.729
What did you...

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:57.815
just say?

00:22:59.901 --> 00:23:01.611
Mr. Sun, you're...

00:23:02.862 --> 00:23:03.738
the one

00:23:05.114 --> 00:23:06.532
I really need.

00:23:14.999 --> 00:23:17.210
The one you really need.

00:23:21.172 --> 00:23:22.548
The one you really need.

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:25.259
The one you really need.

00:23:46.614 --> 00:23:48.866
Judging by their games so far,

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:51.786
I'd say Team Blue has
a bit of an advantage in tug-of-war.

00:23:51.869 --> 00:23:52.787
Yes, I agree.

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:55.081
On top of that, Yang Bok-hee's out,

00:23:55.164 --> 00:23:57.416
so Team White is one player short.

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:00.336
How will Team White
deal with this setback?

00:24:00.419 --> 00:24:01.963
All eyes are on this next game.

00:24:02.046 --> 00:24:03.673
The game is about to start.

00:24:03.756 --> 00:24:04.590
TEAM WHITE
TEAM BLUE

00:24:34.412 --> 00:24:36.372
Get ready, set...

00:24:37.665 --> 00:24:38.916
That's not right.

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:42.295
What? What is it?

00:25:01.522 --> 00:25:03.065
What's happening, everyone?

00:25:03.149 --> 00:25:05.693
Sun Jae-gyu has appeared!

00:25:05.776 --> 00:25:07.570
Is he joining the team?

00:25:07.653 --> 00:25:09.030
This changes everything.

00:25:09.113 --> 00:25:12.408
No one can predict
how the game will play out.

00:25:16.495 --> 00:25:18.205
I'm stepping in...

00:25:22.293 --> 00:25:23.919
as Team White's parent rep.

00:25:24.545 --> 00:25:25.713
Mr. Sun.

00:25:25.796 --> 00:25:26.964
Uncle!

00:25:27.048 --> 00:25:27.882
Master.

00:25:27.965 --> 00:25:29.342
Geez, Uncle.

00:25:36.432 --> 00:25:38.100
Today's chant

00:25:38.601 --> 00:25:39.769
is "Hey, ho."

00:25:41.604 --> 00:25:43.647
When I say "Hey," you shout...

00:25:43.731 --> 00:25:45.649
-Ho!
-Ho!

00:25:54.658 --> 00:25:56.494
Tug-of-war isn't about using your arms.

00:25:57.161 --> 00:25:58.537
It's all in your legs.

00:25:58.621 --> 00:26:00.539
Keep your core tight until the end.

00:26:00.623 --> 00:26:02.708
Tighten your glutes and thighs.

00:26:03.376 --> 00:26:04.668
Heave, ho!

00:26:04.752 --> 00:26:06.837
-Heave, ho!
-Heave, ho!

00:26:07.588 --> 00:26:08.589
Got it?

00:26:08.672 --> 00:26:09.882
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

00:26:39.912 --> 00:26:42.164
The game starts on the referee's signal.

00:26:42.248 --> 00:26:45.501
-Heave, ho!
-Hey, ho!

00:26:45.584 --> 00:26:48.129
-Heave, ho!
-Hey, ho!

00:26:48.212 --> 00:26:50.798
-Hey.
-Ho!

00:26:50.881 --> 00:26:52.925
-Heave, ho!
-Heave, ho!

00:26:53.008 --> 00:26:55.261
The cheers from both sides
echo across the field.

00:26:55.344 --> 00:26:57.638
-Heave, ho!
-Heave, ho!

00:26:57.721 --> 00:26:58.681
-Heave, ho!
-Heave, ho!

00:26:58.764 --> 00:26:59.849
-Hey!
-Ho!

00:26:59.932 --> 00:27:02.226
-Heave, ho!
-Heave, ho!

00:27:02.309 --> 00:27:03.602
-Hey.
-Ho!

00:27:03.686 --> 00:27:05.563
We thought Team White had an advantage...

00:27:05.646 --> 00:27:07.022
-Uncle.
-...with the new player.

00:27:07.106 --> 00:27:08.023
It's a close match.

00:27:08.107 --> 00:27:10.734
-Hey!
-Ho!

00:27:10.818 --> 00:27:13.821
-Heave, ho!
-Heave, ho!

00:27:13.904 --> 00:27:16.615
-Hey, ho!
-Heave, ho!

00:27:18.284 --> 00:27:19.785
-Heave, ho!
-Heave, ho!

00:27:19.869 --> 00:27:21.579
-Hold!
-Heave, ho!

00:27:21.662 --> 00:27:22.705
Hold!

00:27:33.924 --> 00:27:34.800
Hold!

00:27:37.011 --> 00:27:38.637
This is why I can't trust you.

00:27:39.138 --> 00:27:41.932
You always make people trust you
and then betray them.

00:27:42.016 --> 00:27:43.893
You're the one who betrayed me.

00:27:45.644 --> 00:27:48.314
I'm the one
who should be resentful, not you.

00:27:56.572 --> 00:28:00.451
You're the smartest in school,
but you can't think straight?

00:28:01.285 --> 00:28:03.287
Pay the toll.

00:28:06.123 --> 00:28:06.957
Gosh.

00:28:08.083 --> 00:28:08.918
What?

00:28:10.294 --> 00:28:12.004
Wow, he's loaded.

00:28:14.381 --> 00:28:16.383
Damn it. Who are you?

00:28:18.928 --> 00:28:20.179
Sun Jae-gyu?

00:28:23.265 --> 00:28:24.099
Stay right there.

00:28:26.519 --> 00:28:27.436
Pick that up.

00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:33.609
Yeah, give it to him.

00:28:36.487 --> 00:28:37.363
You guys.

00:28:37.863 --> 00:28:41.575
Choi I-jun is someone
I respect as my parenting mentor.

00:28:42.451 --> 00:28:44.328
If anyone touches him at Haechon High,

00:28:44.411 --> 00:28:46.872
you'll have to get past me first.
Is that clear?

00:28:46.956 --> 00:28:48.374
Got it.

00:28:49.458 --> 00:28:50.376
Bye.

00:29:05.099 --> 00:29:07.351
"Read the following poem
and answer the questions."

00:29:08.644 --> 00:29:09.645
Aren't you going home?

00:29:10.354 --> 00:29:12.022
What's your deal, following me here?

00:29:13.399 --> 00:29:14.400
Cooperation.

00:29:14.984 --> 00:29:15.818
Cooperation?

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:19.238
You protect me, and I teach you.

00:29:19.321 --> 00:29:20.155
HAECHON
CHOI I-JUN

00:29:20.239 --> 00:29:24.577
I think this makes it
a fair trade between us.

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.204
No need.

00:29:28.289 --> 00:29:29.707
I'm not going to college.

00:29:31.542 --> 00:29:33.002
If I ever get money,

00:29:34.169 --> 00:29:36.046
I'll get extra formula for Han-gyul.

00:29:36.922 --> 00:29:38.632
I don't have any money for tuition,

00:29:39.592 --> 00:29:42.845
and no time to read any books.

00:29:44.054 --> 00:29:45.556
Stop talking nonsense and go.

00:29:48.559 --> 00:29:50.269
I'll take care of the tuition.

00:29:52.896 --> 00:29:53.981
You?

00:29:55.858 --> 00:29:57.985
If you don't have time
to read, then listen.

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:03.449
"Because I, a poor man,
love beautiful Natasha,

00:30:03.991 --> 00:30:08.454
the snow falls endlessly tonight."

00:30:09.496 --> 00:30:10.956
"Going to the mountains

00:30:11.665 --> 00:30:13.584
doesn't mean you're losing to the world."

00:30:15.544 --> 00:30:16.503
"You throw away

00:30:18.005 --> 00:30:20.924
the world because it's dirty."

00:30:25.888 --> 00:30:27.556
"Going to the mountains

00:30:28.223 --> 00:30:30.059
doesn't mean you're losing to the world."

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:32.645
"You throw away

00:30:34.396 --> 00:30:35.898
the world because it's dirty."

00:30:49.244 --> 00:30:52.623
I've never come in second
or felt regret in my life.

00:30:53.457 --> 00:30:57.920
And my very first regret
was helping you back then,

00:30:58.712 --> 00:31:00.089
Sun Jae-gyu.

00:31:01.465 --> 00:31:02.675
Are you done talking?

00:31:03.634 --> 00:31:08.055
I was holding back because a short show
would be rude to the viewers.

00:31:08.138 --> 00:31:10.140
But I'm wrapping it up now, okay?

00:31:10.224 --> 00:31:12.184
The two teams are still deadlocked,

00:31:12.768 --> 00:31:14.978
and they're completely worn out.

00:31:15.062 --> 00:31:17.439
At this point, they need to settle this.

00:31:28.075 --> 00:31:29.368
Hey!

00:31:29.451 --> 00:31:30.577
Ho!

00:31:37.668 --> 00:31:38.961
Hey, ho!

00:31:39.044 --> 00:31:41.964
With one powerful tug from Sun Jae-gyu,
Team Blue crumbles.

00:31:43.549 --> 00:31:45.592
And just like that, it's over.

00:32:00.774 --> 00:32:02.192
Darn it.

00:32:09.616 --> 00:32:11.618
Sun Jae-gyu is truly amazing.

00:32:11.702 --> 00:32:13.996
Just replacing one parent
completely changed things.

00:32:14.079 --> 00:32:15.914
Team White was on the edge.

00:32:15.998 --> 00:32:18.333
But now they've regained momentum.

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:26.008
It's impossible to tell who'll win.
Blue and White are neck and neck

00:32:26.091 --> 00:32:27.634
right up to the end.

00:32:56.622 --> 00:32:58.749
Where did everyone go?

00:33:00.584 --> 00:33:01.418
Who are you?

00:33:02.085 --> 00:33:03.045
Oh, sorry.

00:33:05.088 --> 00:33:06.465
Well...

00:33:08.675 --> 00:33:10.511
I'm...

00:33:11.053 --> 00:33:13.472
I'm here to see Mr. Sun Jae-gyu.

00:33:13.555 --> 00:33:14.890
I see.

00:33:14.973 --> 00:33:17.976
Han-gyul has a sports festival at school,
so everyone's there.

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:20.270
If it's urgent, should I give him a call?

00:33:20.354 --> 00:33:21.605
No.

00:33:22.189 --> 00:33:24.316
I'll call him myself.

00:33:26.235 --> 00:33:27.069
Well, then.

00:33:31.156 --> 00:33:32.324
Who is she?

00:33:35.536 --> 00:33:39.039
Is she the woman he mentioned earlier?

00:33:42.251 --> 00:33:44.253
THAT WOMAN

00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:52.261
The score's tied at 2 to 2.

00:33:52.344 --> 00:33:56.515
Whoever wins the last round
will claim the victory.

00:33:56.598 --> 00:34:00.352
Mr. Wi Jeong-hwan,
which team do you think will win?

00:34:00.435 --> 00:34:02.896
Yes, it seems Team White
has the upper hand

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:04.398
after winning the previous game.

00:34:04.481 --> 00:34:07.401
Having Sun Jae-gyu
really turned the tide for them.

00:34:07.484 --> 00:34:09.111
What do you think, Principal?

00:34:09.194 --> 00:34:11.321
I'm confident Team Blue
will come out on top.

00:34:11.405 --> 00:34:12.281
There's a reason.

00:34:12.364 --> 00:34:15.409
We've seen how inconsistent
Team White's play has been.

00:34:15.492 --> 00:34:16.952
On the other hand, Team Blue

00:34:17.035 --> 00:34:20.247
has earned many points
thanks to their steady performance.

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:22.040
That's right. And as we speak,

00:34:22.124 --> 00:34:24.501
the final event
of Shinsu High's sports festival,

00:34:24.585 --> 00:34:26.461
the piñata game, is kicking off.

00:34:26.545 --> 00:34:29.590
You've worked hard keeping up
with the tough training. Great job.

00:34:29.673 --> 00:34:32.843
Since this is the final game,

00:34:32.926 --> 00:34:35.053
blow off all the stress
you've been holding back.

00:34:35.137 --> 00:34:37.598
Toss it cursing at someone you hate,

00:34:37.681 --> 00:34:40.183
or shout out what you've been holding in
as you toss.

00:34:40.267 --> 00:34:43.020
Have fun and throw your heart out.

00:34:43.103 --> 00:34:44.146
I'll take care...

00:34:45.105 --> 00:34:46.940
of everything else, got it?

00:34:47.024 --> 00:34:48.525
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

00:34:48.609 --> 00:34:50.360
You're the one in charge of the outcome.

00:34:51.069 --> 00:34:52.237
Throw as hard as you can.

00:34:53.447 --> 00:34:54.531
Let's meet at the top.

00:34:54.615 --> 00:34:56.158
Go, Team Blue!

00:34:56.241 --> 00:34:57.993
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:12.424
Let's go.

00:35:15.344 --> 00:35:16.637
Let's go!

00:35:43.246 --> 00:35:44.581
It's not about the wrist.

00:35:44.665 --> 00:35:46.667
It's all about the snap, okay?

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:48.585
Pinch it, like this.

00:35:48.669 --> 00:35:50.671
Clench your fist.

00:35:50.754 --> 00:35:53.298
Picture the face of the jerk
you want to curse at.

00:35:54.508 --> 00:35:57.386
"Get the hell out of my sight!"

00:35:57.469 --> 00:35:58.303
Try it.

00:35:58.387 --> 00:35:59.930
I can't say that around students.

00:36:00.013 --> 00:36:02.599
Try it. That doesn't even count
as swearing.

00:36:03.141 --> 00:36:04.559
Hey, aim properly.

00:36:04.643 --> 00:36:06.478
Straight!

00:36:06.561 --> 00:36:08.063
Work harder!

00:36:08.897 --> 00:36:09.731
Harder!

00:36:12.359 --> 00:36:14.569
Get the hell out of my sight!

00:36:17.864 --> 00:36:19.032
Good job. One more time.

00:36:19.116 --> 00:36:19.992
One more time?

00:36:22.411 --> 00:36:25.288
Team White is finally landing hits.

00:36:25.372 --> 00:36:26.832
They're gaining on Team Blue.

00:36:27.332 --> 00:36:28.917
It's not my fault I'm ugly!

00:36:29.001 --> 00:36:31.378
It's not like I want my grades to suck!

00:36:31.461 --> 00:36:33.797
I have no idea what I want to be!

00:36:36.341 --> 00:36:38.802
I'll get a boyfriend!

00:36:39.845 --> 00:36:42.305
Right now, Team Blue's piñata
is starting to open up.

00:36:42.389 --> 00:36:43.640
It's open!

00:36:43.724 --> 00:36:45.559
Look at Team Blue.

00:36:45.642 --> 00:36:47.436
Oh, my.

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:48.854
Hurry.

00:37:21.595 --> 00:37:26.600
Who will claim the final victory
at Shinsu High's sports festival?

00:38:08.809 --> 00:38:10.227
CONGRATULATIONS, TEAM WHITE WINS

00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:12.020
The victory goes to Team White!

00:38:13.855 --> 00:38:15.065
Team White!

00:38:15.148 --> 00:38:16.983
Team White's piñata opens first.

00:38:17.067 --> 00:38:18.860
The final score is 3 to 2.

00:38:18.944 --> 00:38:22.197
After a fierce battle,
the ultimate victory

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:24.407
at the Shinsu High Sports Festival goes to

00:38:24.491 --> 00:38:26.910
-Team White!
-Team White!

00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:46.304
CONGRATULATIONS, TEAM WHITE WINS

00:39:29.723 --> 00:39:31.308
SPORTS FESTIVAL CHAMPION

00:39:42.152 --> 00:39:42.986
Traitor.

00:39:44.196 --> 00:39:46.615
You little punk.
You can't call your uncle a traitor.

00:39:47.616 --> 00:39:50.202
Since the day I was born,

00:39:50.285 --> 00:39:52.120
I've never gone back on a promise to you.

00:39:53.121 --> 00:39:55.916
You told me not to swear,
so I didn't even utter a harsh word.

00:39:55.999 --> 00:39:57.542
You told me to stay out of trouble,

00:39:57.626 --> 00:39:59.878
so I didn't even touch
a cigarette or alcohol.

00:39:59.961 --> 00:40:01.504
You told me to listen to teachers,

00:40:01.588 --> 00:40:03.715
so I even gave in to Hong Jung-pyo.

00:40:04.758 --> 00:40:07.844
But how could my one and only family

00:40:07.928 --> 00:40:09.387
break a promise with me?

00:40:11.473 --> 00:40:12.766
Why did you do that?

00:40:15.268 --> 00:40:16.186
Just why?

00:40:18.313 --> 00:40:19.147
I don't know.

00:40:19.981 --> 00:40:20.815
You don't know?

00:40:20.899 --> 00:40:22.567
Yes.

00:40:22.651 --> 00:40:24.653
I don't know why I ran around like crazy

00:40:24.736 --> 00:40:26.738
and went out to the field,
breaking a promise

00:40:26.821 --> 00:40:28.156
to my one and only nephew.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:30.242
I don't even understand myself.

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:40.293
So why did you try so hard to lose?

00:40:41.378 --> 00:40:43.922
Like you said,
I'm your one and only family.

00:40:44.005 --> 00:40:45.882
Do you really think I didn't know

00:40:46.549 --> 00:40:47.968
you threw the baton on purpose?

00:40:48.969 --> 00:40:49.803
I don't know.

00:40:49.886 --> 00:40:51.554
You don't know?

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:54.516
Just like you, I have no idea.

00:40:55.850 --> 00:40:57.018
I just...

00:40:57.602 --> 00:41:00.647
want to see her smile.
That's all I want to see.

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:03.024
It's the same for me.

00:41:15.203 --> 00:41:16.621
I'm the best

00:41:16.705 --> 00:41:18.999
No, Bom-sik is the best.

00:41:24.254 --> 00:41:26.798
I got the medal

00:41:26.881 --> 00:41:27.882
SHINSU HIGH
SUN JAE-GYU

00:41:32.512 --> 00:41:33.722
I got the medal.

00:41:33.805 --> 00:41:36.057
No, Bom-sik's Dad did!

00:41:41.563 --> 00:41:46.860
Everyone can see I'm totally killing it

00:41:46.943 --> 00:41:48.486
All right

00:41:49.321 --> 00:41:50.363
Sun Jae-gyu.

00:41:51.281 --> 00:41:53.742
What a killer guy.

00:41:55.785 --> 00:41:58.121
How can he get more attractive
the more I look?

00:41:58.913 --> 00:42:00.707
Smooth surface.

00:42:06.629 --> 00:42:08.256
Solid frame.

00:42:14.095 --> 00:42:17.057
Even that sparkling night dew.

00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:30.737
Back off, Yoon Bom.

00:42:35.408 --> 00:42:36.242
You want to know?

00:42:37.494 --> 00:42:38.328
Yes.

00:42:38.828 --> 00:42:41.498
Then win the medal for Bom-sik.

00:42:42.123 --> 00:42:45.293
I'll tell you why
on the day Bom-sik gets the medal.

00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:49.172
Geez, this mouth of mine is the problem.

00:42:49.798 --> 00:42:53.259
Even if it was urgent,
I shouldn't have made a stupid promise.

00:42:55.261 --> 00:42:57.514
I'm embarrassed to tell the truth,

00:42:57.597 --> 00:42:59.599
but I feel guilty to lie.

00:43:01.309 --> 00:43:02.894
What do I tell him tomorrow?

00:43:10.193 --> 00:43:15.490
The multi-purpose youth culture center
I'm planning is...

00:43:15.573 --> 00:43:19.911
We can use this section
for the press release.

00:43:19.994 --> 00:43:22.372
If you're going to include
the sports festival footage,

00:43:23.415 --> 00:43:26.626
let's include Se-jin
crossing the finish line in the relay.

00:43:26.709 --> 00:43:27.752
Come on.

00:43:31.172 --> 00:43:33.007
Wait, right here.

00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:42.058
My goodness.

00:43:42.142 --> 00:43:44.060
You don't cry even when you fail exams.

00:43:46.938 --> 00:43:47.939
Se-jin.

00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:49.899
You're no different.

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:53.278
There's no one on my side in our family.

00:43:55.572 --> 00:43:56.823
I'll make up for it.

00:43:57.574 --> 00:43:59.492
What can you do with a lost game?

00:43:59.576 --> 00:44:02.245
You lost the sports festival,
but you still have the finals.

00:44:03.163 --> 00:44:06.166
I'll sit with you
and tutor you personally, okay?

00:44:06.249 --> 00:44:07.459
Really?

00:44:08.001 --> 00:44:09.377
No, forget it.

00:44:15.425 --> 00:44:16.801
I mean it.

00:44:16.885 --> 00:44:21.264
I'll make sure you get first place
for the whole school on the finals, okay?

00:44:28.605 --> 00:44:29.564
What's wrong?

00:44:29.647 --> 00:44:30.648
Se-jin?

00:44:46.956 --> 00:44:48.208
Keep it if you want.

00:44:48.291 --> 00:44:50.502
There's no room for this stupid medal
in our house.

00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:58.384
You don't want it?

00:45:01.721 --> 00:45:03.640
Fine, it's not gold anyway.

00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:05.725
It's just metal.

00:45:07.101 --> 00:45:10.021
Forget that stupid sports festival
that doesn't affect your grades

00:45:10.104 --> 00:45:11.272
and focus on your finals.

00:45:26.621 --> 00:45:27.455
Eat up.

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:32.585
This is why you can't beat me.

00:45:33.253 --> 00:45:34.504
Studying is a stamina game.

00:45:34.587 --> 00:45:37.840
Crying out of frustration
drains your energy. How would you beat me?

00:45:48.059 --> 00:45:48.893
Sun Han-gyul.

00:46:11.541 --> 00:46:12.500
Do you...

00:46:14.377 --> 00:46:15.753
like me?

00:46:19.591 --> 00:46:21.092
Oh, my goodness.

00:46:21.175 --> 00:46:23.136
Bom-sik scored two wins.

00:46:23.219 --> 00:46:25.888
-I kept my promise, okay?
-I did too.

00:46:28.891 --> 00:46:32.145
Once you fill out
the animal registration form,

00:46:32.228 --> 00:46:33.938
the adoption is complete.

00:46:34.022 --> 00:46:35.773
Which of you will be taking him home?

00:46:36.357 --> 00:46:37.275
-Me.
-I will.

00:46:42.864 --> 00:46:45.199
Why would you take Bom-sik?

00:46:45.283 --> 00:46:47.452
Of course Mom should take him.

00:46:47.535 --> 00:46:49.996
He's named after me, "Bom-sik."

00:46:50.538 --> 00:46:53.041
Come on, that's nonsense.

00:46:53.124 --> 00:46:55.251
I was the first to know about Bom-sik.

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:59.922
I rescued him from the landslide
and pulled him out of the drain.

00:47:00.006 --> 00:47:03.676
Haven't you two agreed
on who's going to raise him?

00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:05.595
Doctor...

00:47:05.678 --> 00:47:07.555
I should be the one raising Bom-sik.

00:47:08.097 --> 00:47:10.683
I may not look it,
but I've raised a newborn

00:47:10.767 --> 00:47:13.269
into a proper high school student.

00:47:13.353 --> 00:47:14.187
Doctor.

00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:16.522
I'm a teacher with a degree in education.

00:47:16.606 --> 00:47:19.400
With years of experience
guiding teenagers,

00:47:19.484 --> 00:47:24.572
I'm confident I can support
Bom-sik's growth and development.

00:47:24.656 --> 00:47:27.659
Only one person can register the animal.

00:47:31.579 --> 00:47:33.039
I might give up on other stuff,

00:47:33.748 --> 00:47:35.249
but I could never give him up.

00:47:35.333 --> 00:47:37.752
I can't give up
on this little guy either, Doctor.

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:49.514
Bom-sik.

00:47:49.597 --> 00:47:51.641
No, it's okay. Everything's fine.

00:47:51.724 --> 00:47:55.061
I'm sorry. We shouldn't be doing this
in front of a kid.

00:47:56.437 --> 00:47:57.647
Don't cry.

00:48:00.358 --> 00:48:01.359
Give it to me, please.

00:48:02.777 --> 00:48:04.779
ANIMAL REGISTRATION, CHANGE REQUEST

00:48:06.572 --> 00:48:08.241
Twice a week.

00:48:08.324 --> 00:48:12.537
Since I gave up custody,
you have to let me visit him.

00:48:18.209 --> 00:48:20.753
All right, are you ready to be discharged?

00:48:29.011 --> 00:48:30.054
Stop right there.

00:48:32.765 --> 00:48:35.143
Didn't you promise to tell me the reason

00:48:35.226 --> 00:48:36.936
when we put the medal on Bom-sik?

00:48:40.898 --> 00:48:42.066
Did I?

00:48:44.277 --> 00:48:45.987
Promises are meant to be kept.

00:48:48.489 --> 00:48:51.242
Fine, I'll keep my promise.

00:48:52.493 --> 00:48:54.871
I said I'd tell you
on the day we put the medal on,

00:48:54.954 --> 00:48:57.248
but I never said what time, did I?

00:48:57.331 --> 00:48:58.207
Right?

00:49:07.675 --> 00:49:09.510
You have 12 hours left.

00:49:23.733 --> 00:49:25.693
I'm late because of traffic.

00:49:25.777 --> 00:49:28.112
I heard you had a rough time
at the showcase.

00:49:28.196 --> 00:49:29.113
Attorney Choi.

00:49:29.906 --> 00:49:32.533
You asked me
why I was so harsh to my daughter.

00:49:33.117 --> 00:49:35.203
This is exactly why.

00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:38.456
Honey, my medicine.

00:49:38.539 --> 00:49:39.373
Right. On it.

00:49:42.877 --> 00:49:43.961
Here.

00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:47.757
You know how it is, Attorney Choi.

00:49:48.466 --> 00:49:50.468
She's had a rough time
dealing with the press.

00:49:51.385 --> 00:49:53.721
I didn't tell Bom
because I didn't want her to worry,

00:49:54.263 --> 00:49:55.097
but if she knew

00:49:55.181 --> 00:49:57.809
her mom was relying on anti-anxiety meds
to hold it together,

00:49:58.392 --> 00:50:00.478
she would've understood a bit.

00:50:00.561 --> 00:50:02.647
What should I do?

00:50:03.272 --> 00:50:06.275
Isn't there a way to save Jeong Nan-hee
both as an actress

00:50:06.818 --> 00:50:07.819
and as a mom?

00:50:11.572 --> 00:50:14.033
TASK FORCE FOR SASHIMI

00:50:15.201 --> 00:50:17.537
Task force for sashimi!

00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:20.248
How expensive is this sashimi
that you even set up an office?

00:50:20.331 --> 00:50:22.083
Bluefin tuna? Sea bream?

00:50:23.459 --> 00:50:24.669
I've repurposed it.

00:50:24.752 --> 00:50:27.255
It's a task force for the grand opening.

00:50:27.338 --> 00:50:28.589
What? Wait, Attorney Choi.

00:50:28.673 --> 00:50:29.507
MOVING COMPANY

00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:31.717
Fresh air is the only good thing here.

00:50:31.801 --> 00:50:34.637
This town has no crimes, scams,
people live happily ever after.

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:35.930
Why open a business here...

00:50:40.017 --> 00:50:40.977
That plushie.

00:50:41.894 --> 00:50:42.770
That massager.

00:50:43.688 --> 00:50:44.897
That pencil holder.

00:50:44.981 --> 00:50:45.815
Those are all mine.

00:50:46.524 --> 00:50:49.402
What the heck?
Do you expect me to stay here alone?

00:50:49.485 --> 00:50:52.947
I don't have a friend or a girlfriend.
I can't be alone in this remote place.

00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:55.575
That's what
I should be telling you right now.

00:50:55.658 --> 00:50:59.579
Then how am I supposed
to add tangsuyuk when I get jjajang?

00:51:00.162 --> 00:51:01.873
Who toasts with me when I drink soju?

00:51:01.956 --> 00:51:05.042
Who do I share fried rice with,
the essential Korean finale?

00:51:05.126 --> 00:51:08.880
I'm fully aware
of the concerns in that situation.

00:51:08.963 --> 00:51:10.339
You're hired.

00:51:11.591 --> 00:51:12.633
You can start tomorrow.

00:51:13.217 --> 00:51:14.093
Thank you.

00:51:17.305 --> 00:51:18.222
ATTORNEY CHOI I-JUN

00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:23.853
This is why my mom told me
to read a lot of books.

00:51:26.147 --> 00:51:28.733
But, seriously, why here?

00:51:28.816 --> 00:51:30.151
What's in this nowhere town?

00:51:34.947 --> 00:51:35.865
Everything.

00:51:40.036 --> 00:51:42.663
Geez, why does time feel like
it's standing still?

00:51:46.167 --> 00:51:48.669
He's had all the shots,
so he shouldn't get sick, right?

00:51:50.338 --> 00:51:52.089
How much should I feed him?

00:51:52.173 --> 00:51:53.341
How many walks a day?

00:52:03.476 --> 00:52:06.479
Oh, my. What did he eat to poop that much?

00:52:07.313 --> 00:52:09.815
Wow, great job.

00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:18.574
What do I do?

00:52:19.450 --> 00:52:21.619
It's warm, so it feels weird.

00:52:21.702 --> 00:52:23.537
I should wait until it cools down, right?

00:52:23.621 --> 00:52:25.373
My goodness.

00:52:25.998 --> 00:52:27.208
Give it to me.

00:52:28.042 --> 00:52:30.378
No need to cool it down.

00:52:30.962 --> 00:52:33.923
Just pick it up.

00:52:34.006 --> 00:52:36.300
Moisture check, perfect.

00:52:37.677 --> 00:52:40.805
Digestion's great. He's healthy.

00:52:40.888 --> 00:52:42.014
Oh, my.

00:52:45.559 --> 00:52:49.188
Raising kids starts
with cleaning up their poop.

00:52:51.399 --> 00:52:52.733
Good job.

00:52:56.237 --> 00:52:57.071
Wait.

00:52:57.947 --> 00:52:58.948
Look at this.

00:52:59.448 --> 00:53:01.492
It's all bumpy. There's something here.

00:53:01.993 --> 00:53:03.411
It's nothing.

00:53:04.036 --> 00:53:05.454
Those are Bom-sik's nipples.

00:53:09.166 --> 00:53:10.501
I don't think I can do this.

00:53:11.627 --> 00:53:14.213
I took him in since he's cute,
not knowing how to raise him.

00:53:14.797 --> 00:53:16.716
If I mess up or end up hurting him,

00:53:16.799 --> 00:53:19.468
he might resent his mom too.

00:53:20.511 --> 00:53:21.512
Mom?

00:53:23.723 --> 00:53:25.224
Why?

00:53:26.350 --> 00:53:28.310
Did something happen
between you and your mom?

00:53:29.437 --> 00:53:31.522
I'm just saying.

00:53:32.815 --> 00:53:35.735
What kind of mom
would want to mess up raising her kid?

00:53:43.075 --> 00:53:46.829
I made tons of mistakes
when I was raising Han-gyul.

00:53:48.289 --> 00:53:51.125
I didn't know how to put a diaper on,
so I put it on backward.

00:53:52.126 --> 00:53:55.087
He was crying because he was tired,
but I kept feeding him formula.

00:53:56.881 --> 00:53:58.632
Can I give you a parenting tip?

00:54:00.384 --> 00:54:03.971
When raising a kid,
as long as you focus on this one thing,

00:54:04.055 --> 00:54:06.807
you might make mistakes,
but you'll never fail.

00:54:08.059 --> 00:54:09.018
What is that?

00:54:14.315 --> 00:54:15.149
Love.

00:54:18.110 --> 00:54:20.696
No matter how many mistakes parents make,

00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:22.364
if there's love in it,

00:54:23.282 --> 00:54:24.950
kids are bound to forgive them.

00:54:27.536 --> 00:54:29.622
So don't worry too much.

00:54:30.748 --> 00:54:32.500
From what I see, Bom-sik is...

00:54:33.501 --> 00:54:36.504
He'll get more love here
than most others get elsewhere.

00:54:37.088 --> 00:54:37.922
That's for sure.

00:54:38.672 --> 00:54:39.507
Am I right?

00:54:40.633 --> 00:54:42.802
Now, go to your mom, Bom-sik.

00:54:46.931 --> 00:54:48.015
It's almost done.

00:54:52.561 --> 00:54:54.688
It's all done. Bom-sik's house.

00:54:56.941 --> 00:54:58.567
Hang out here when you're outside.

00:54:59.527 --> 00:55:01.237
-Okay.
-You want to try?

00:55:01.946 --> 00:55:02.780
There.

00:55:02.863 --> 00:55:05.032
There you go.

00:55:06.158 --> 00:55:07.159
Wow.

00:55:07.243 --> 00:55:08.577
He seems to like it.

00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:10.454
Do you like it?

00:55:10.538 --> 00:55:13.082
I got you a house
when everything costs a fortune.

00:55:13.165 --> 00:55:15.167
So grow up fast and make me proud, okay?

00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:19.713
You did great. Do you like it?

00:55:23.968 --> 00:55:25.052
I love you.

00:55:35.855 --> 00:55:39.024
I love you, Dad.
Thank you for getting me a house.

00:55:41.861 --> 00:55:42.945
Thank you.

00:55:51.954 --> 00:55:52.788
Sure.

00:55:55.749 --> 00:55:57.084
Bom-sik.

00:55:57.168 --> 00:55:59.211
I love you too.

00:55:59.295 --> 00:56:00.254
I love you.

00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:08.012
Since we love each other,
shall we go for a walk?

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:11.682
Sure, let's go take a walk.

00:56:20.316 --> 00:56:21.567
Bom-sik.

00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:24.028
Leave him be.
There's only the two of us here.

00:56:25.571 --> 00:56:28.282
Even if you work here,

00:56:28.365 --> 00:56:30.534
shouldn't you not sneak in
like this at night?

00:56:31.452 --> 00:56:33.329
What if the owner finds out?

00:56:33.412 --> 00:56:36.207
He said it was fine,
so don't worry about it.

00:56:36.916 --> 00:56:40.169
Now, we have one minute left.

00:56:41.462 --> 00:56:43.255
Why are you so curious?

00:56:44.924 --> 00:56:47.259
Actually, I've got a few guesses.

00:56:49.678 --> 00:56:52.056
Is it because I saw your drunken antics?

00:56:53.474 --> 00:56:54.308
No.

00:56:55.142 --> 00:56:57.561
Or because I keep asking you
what happened in Seoul?

00:56:57.645 --> 00:56:58.604
No.

00:56:58.687 --> 00:57:02.107
Is it because I acted
as the Heir of the Wasp Family?

00:57:02.775 --> 00:57:03.692
Not at all.

00:57:04.568 --> 00:57:05.819
Then that must be it.

00:57:06.987 --> 00:57:08.072
Well...

00:57:08.155 --> 00:57:09.114
Isn't it because

00:57:09.865 --> 00:57:11.742
I keep trying to cross the line with you?

00:57:14.078 --> 00:57:16.789
It's not because
you might cross the line, Mr. Sun.

00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:18.999
What is it, then?

00:57:20.459 --> 00:57:22.503
If it's not because
I might cross the line,

00:57:22.586 --> 00:57:24.755
what made you that angry?

00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:33.889
Ten seconds.

00:57:37.184 --> 00:57:38.018
Nine seconds.

00:57:44.942 --> 00:57:46.527
I was afraid I might cross the line.

00:58:58.223 --> 00:58:59.683
Did you see that, Ms. Bom?

00:59:00.559 --> 00:59:02.394
-What's that?
-I'll show you

00:59:02.478 --> 00:59:04.146
what happens in Shinsu

00:59:04.229 --> 00:59:07.107
when I decide to make myself attractive.

00:59:07.191 --> 00:59:09.276
Oh, my. Wait, Mr. Sun!

00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:10.986
If it's that hard, then break it.

00:59:11.070 --> 00:59:14.406
If what you want is to break the promise,
then I suppose we should.

00:59:14.490 --> 00:59:16.784
Some jerk was trying
to break into your house.

00:59:16.867 --> 00:59:18.077
You're dead today.

00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:19.953
Jump in when needed, step back when not.

00:59:20.037 --> 00:59:23.248
If it's about you, I'm always jumping in.
I'll never step back.

00:59:28.712 --> 00:59:30.714
