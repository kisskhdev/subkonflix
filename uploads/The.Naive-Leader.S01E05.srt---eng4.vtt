WEBVTT

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.159
Take a look, take a look.

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.040
Dong Jiuguan's Tumble Wine.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.680
Drink it by day, full of energy.

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:45.120
Drink it at night, shake the bedhead.

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:47.400
Passing by? Weigh out two ounces.

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:48.959
Guaranteed, once you drink it...

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:51.439
One sip makes you want a second.

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:53.439
Take a look, take a look here.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.480
Take a look.

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:14.400
My woman.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.400
Why are you...

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.319
selling wine here?

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.240
I miss you so much.

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:32.479
What are you doing?

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.439
Spacing out this early in the morning?

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.800
I'm looking for...

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.120
I'm looking for my woman.

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:40.240
Get out of the way.

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:44.840
I miss you so much.

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:46.280
I really miss...

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.919
Papa.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:48.840
You son of a turtle.

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:49.840
You looking to die?

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.599
What's the matter?

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.080
I'm the Pair of Red Hearts.

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:00.439
You dummy.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.080
I'm a trained fighter.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.719
I think you look like a madman.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.240
What do we do with him lying here?

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.319
Don't mind him.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.599
He fell down on his own.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.719
It has nothing to do with me.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.719
He's burning up.

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:36.800
Is he still breathing?

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.000
You're in big trouble.

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:39.199
Dong Jiuguan.

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:40.840
You've got yourself into a huge mess.

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:41.919
Papa.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.039
Otherwise...

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.639
let's go find a doctor.

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.159
Where can we find a doctor?

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.439
They've all been conscripted by the soldiers.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.680
Dong Jiuguan.

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:51.120
If there are no doctors...

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.840
just get the one at the market entrance...

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.199
get the Veterinarian, won't that work?

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:57.000
Right, right, right.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.680
That's it.

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:58.840
A Veterinarian.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.120
No way, no way.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.680
Why not?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.439
Look, there are so many kinds of animals.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.919
The Veterinarian can cure them all.

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.960
Humans...

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.280
evolved from monkeys too.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.120
In the end, we're all animals.

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:10.159
He can cure him.

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:12.560
You, quick...

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:14.439
go find the Veterinarian, hurry.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.800
Alright, alright.

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:19.360
Xiu Gu.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.919
Is it a pig? Is it a chicken?

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.160
Is it male? Is it female?

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.959
It's an ox.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.199
Standing there and just fell over.

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:25.399
Standing there and just fell over.

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:26.639
Might be the Stagger Plague.

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:27.519
Where is it?

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:29.560
Maybe... maybe inside the house.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.399
Over there?

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:34.959
Great.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.240
Quick, quick, quick.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.600
Come.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.040
Right here.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.519
It's a human!

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:43.600
Can't treat him, can't treat him.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.439
You can, you can, you can.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.399
You can treat him.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.639
I treat livestock.

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:50.800
I just deliver piglets for sows...

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.120
castrate roosters...

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.040
I treat things that can't talk.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.040
He can't talk right now either.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.439
Doctor Veterinarian.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.600
Saving a life is better than building a seven-story pagoda.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.240
You're a living miracle doctor.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.920
Treat him.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.600
Go on, treat him.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.079
Give it a try.

00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:09.160
Just try.

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:10.079
Try it.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.000
Then I'll treat him.

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:14.319
Do it.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.040
Belly's a foot long

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:27.199
Give or take an inch

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.560
That's a fine set of lower teeth

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.600
He's burning up something fierce

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:45.600
I only brought sweat-inducing medicine for cows

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:47.800
Don't know if he can take it

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.680
At a time like this

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.439
Just give it a try

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:57.480
Give it a try

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.800
Give it a try

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.560
Then let's try it

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.560
Come here, Xiu Gu

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:08.000
Mix this with some water

00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:08.639
Okay

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:11.759
Whether you're cured or not

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:14.560
Depends on your own luck

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.199
You aren't a cow

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:20.040
And you aren't a horse

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:22.439
In this world

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.040
People live worse than livestock

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.959
If I manage to cure you

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.839
It means your life is cheap

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.639
If I treat you to death

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:37.240
It means your life is precious

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:39.480
Means Heaven wants to take you back

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.279
And there's nothing I can do

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.800
Here, hold this

00:06:45.519 --> 00:06:47.480
I... I can't do it

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:48.319
Let me do it

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.759
Aim it right

00:06:58.199 --> 00:06:59.199
He can still swallow

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.639
Done

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.879
Come on

00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:05.839
Help him up

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.639
Shake him hard

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:08.439
Help him up

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:11.120
Come on, help him up

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.079
Come on, lift him

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.839
One, two, three, four

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:18.439
Five, six, seven, eight

00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:31.879
Oh no, oh no, oh no

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.279
He's dead, isn't he?

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.600
I told you beforehand

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.319
I treat cows

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.800
Don't you leave! This...

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.360
What do we do now that he's dead?

00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:53.040
Don't tell me...

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.959
I can't even be an ox.

00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:00.519
Just treat him boldly.

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:04.959
Look, he's come back to life.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:07.920
It seems from now on,

00:08:08.199 --> 00:08:10.439
I can not only hang a veterinarian's sign,

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:13.199
but also a doctor's sign.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:15.839
You bastard.

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:17.439
Scared the hell out of me.

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:28.839
Thank you for saving my life.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.839
Take these corn kernels.

00:08:30.959 --> 00:08:31.759
They're for making liquor.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.680
They should be enough to feed you for a while on the road.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.199
I don't even know

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:39.440
where I should go.

00:08:39.759 --> 00:08:43.120
Eels and loaches don't even have hands or feet,

00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:44.480
yet they still strive to live.

00:08:45.039 --> 00:08:47.240
You're a huge pile when standing,

00:08:47.639 --> 00:08:49.080
and a massive lump when sitting.

00:08:50.159 --> 00:08:51.039
Surely

00:08:51.039 --> 00:08:52.919
you aren't worse than an eel or a loach?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.480
Good medicine tastes bitter; honest advice sounds harsh.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:58.840
Uncle Dong.

00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:00.600
Your words have woken me up.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.559
Who are you calling Uncle Dong?

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.799
Looking at your face,

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.639
we're about the same age.

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.120
Just call me Old Dong.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:12.360
Old Dong.

00:09:13.919 --> 00:09:14.600
Why don't

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.759
you let me stay here?

00:09:17.399 --> 00:09:19.000
I'll work like an ox or a horse here

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.480
to repay you for saving my life.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.480
No way.

00:09:22.559 --> 00:09:23.399
You eat so much,

00:09:23.399 --> 00:09:24.480
who could afford to feed you?

00:09:24.639 --> 00:09:25.039
I...

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.320
I'll eat a little less.

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:29.159
We don't know where you come from,

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.000
or if you're a good person or a bad one.

00:09:31.879 --> 00:09:32.799
Exactly, exactly.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.159
Look,

00:09:34.159 --> 00:09:36.559
my daughter has a childhood betrothal,

00:09:36.679 --> 00:09:38.639
and she's about to get married soon.

00:09:39.039 --> 00:09:41.480
Suddenly having you,

00:09:41.799 --> 00:09:42.879
a strange man around,

00:09:43.639 --> 00:09:44.159
isn't appropriate.

00:09:44.279 --> 00:09:45.759
I think it's very appropriate.

00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:49.080
Dad,

00:09:49.399 --> 00:09:50.519
you're getting old.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.320
The heavy work around the house

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.720
is very hard for you to do.

00:09:54.919 --> 00:09:56.559
Are you willing to work like an ox or a horse?

00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:57.320
I am.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.799
He can sleep in the woodshed.

00:09:58.879 --> 00:10:00.240
Eating just means an extra pair of chopsticks.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.879
He can lend a hand with whatever needs doing.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.159
It's very appropriate.

00:10:04.519 --> 00:10:06.879
If others see, they'll gossip.

00:10:07.559 --> 00:10:09.000
It will affect your marriage.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.440
That would be big trouble.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.240
Old Dong,

00:10:12.399 --> 00:10:13.279
I promise you,

00:10:13.759 --> 00:10:15.720
I will never fool around with her.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.159
Mouths are on other people's faces.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.360
Can you shut them up?

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.879
I'm not afraid of gossip.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.759
You said yourself it's my marriage.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.000
I know what I'm doing.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.000
It's settled then.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.919
I already have a woman.

00:10:28.519 --> 00:10:30.799
I definitely won't have any improper thoughts about her.

00:10:50.159 --> 00:10:50.759
Stop right there

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.039
You leave early and return late every day

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.320
What exactly are you up to?

00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:03.399
Still searching the whole town for him

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.919
I'm afraid you've got hysteria

00:11:07.879 --> 00:11:08.679
No, I haven't

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.799
Child, where does it hurt?

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.639
Tell me

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.879
So I can go fetch a doctor

00:11:14.879 --> 00:11:16.600
To take a good look at you

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.320
I am not sick

00:11:18.559 --> 00:11:19.480
Then how about this

00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:22.000
Go back to your parents' home for a few days

00:11:22.519 --> 00:11:23.919
Just to clear your mind

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.279
Great-uncle

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.240
Are you trying to drive me away?

00:11:31.799 --> 00:11:32.639
I won't go

00:11:33.679 --> 00:11:34.919
In life, I belong to Sha'er

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.399
In death, I'll be his ghost

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.000
I still need to care for you in Sha'er's place

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.159
To look after you until the end

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.720
Please don't drive me away

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.080
It's rare to see such devotion, child

00:11:49.639 --> 00:11:51.399
Then let's just live a quiet life

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.840
The things and people of the past...

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.320
Let them remain in the past

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.279
Don't dwell on them anymore

00:11:59.919 --> 00:12:01.240
Our family has been unfortunate

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.840
The Fan family has withered away

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:29.000
Red bean mooncakes, five-nut mooncakes

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:30.919
It's spilling! It's spilling!

00:12:36.399 --> 00:12:38.159
What kind of firecracker is that loud?

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.559
That's no firecracker

00:12:39.799 --> 00:12:40.840
Don't you guys know yet?

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.639
Fighting has started in the southwest again

00:12:43.879 --> 00:12:44.679
Fighting again?

00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:48.200
You're spilling it everywhere

00:12:48.279 --> 00:12:48.639
Okay, okay

00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:50.080
Xiu Gu, you fill it up

00:12:56.159 --> 00:12:57.279
Who's fighting who?

00:12:57.279 --> 00:12:58.159
Can't make heads or tails of it

00:12:58.759 --> 00:12:59.679
Those soldiers...

00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:01.039
It's like they're playing house all day

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.919
Fighting today, making peace tomorrow

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.720
Then teaming up to fight someone else the next day

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.919
As for me, I'm getting ready to return to Weiyuan

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.960
Commander Liao's territory is the only peaceful place now

00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:12.360
Let them fight

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.440
As long as they don't...

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.960
...smash my wine jar, I'm fine

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.320
Come here a second, brother

00:13:20.799 --> 00:13:21.279
Come

00:13:22.879 --> 00:13:23.879
You're from Weiyuan?

00:13:24.159 --> 00:13:25.039
I'm half a local, I suppose

00:13:25.039 --> 00:13:26.039
I've been away for years

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.279
We're fellow townsmen

00:13:28.519 --> 00:13:30.080
Could I trouble you to do me a favor?

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:30.600
Sure

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.960
Wait a moment, just a moment

00:13:32.919 --> 00:13:33.720
Hurry it up

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.039
Alright, that's enough

00:13:47.519 --> 00:13:48.080
Brother

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.679
Please take this letter for me...

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.320
...back to Weiyuan

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.639
Deliver it to the Fan family...

00:13:53.879 --> 00:13:55.720
...into the hands of the Young Mistress

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.840
Whatever you do, don't give it to...

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.200
...Old Master Fan

00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:58.879
Don't worry

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:00.440
Hold on

00:14:02.879 --> 00:14:03.799
Take this jar of wine...

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.360
...back with you as well

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:06.960
No problem

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:07.399
Thanks

00:14:07.519 --> 00:14:07.799
I'm off

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.159
How should we settle up for this wine?

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.840
You go on ahead

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:15.480
Alright, alright

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.600
For this jar of wine...

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:20.559
I'll just...

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.879
...carry two extra buckets of water

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.120
Fine, fine

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.679
The Young Mistress of the Fan family...

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.200
My woman

00:14:37.519 --> 00:14:38.759
So you're actually a young master

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.720
No wonder you don't know how to do any work

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.639
Then why don't you go home?

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.679
It's a sore subject

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.080
It's a long story

00:14:57.159 --> 00:14:59.000
Yu Zhen

00:14:59.639 --> 00:15:01.279
Yu Zhen

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.000
Xiu Gu

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.759
Xiu Gu, I'm back. Xiu Gu.

00:15:09.399 --> 00:15:10.440
Xiu Gu

00:15:12.159 --> 00:15:13.120
Xiu Gu

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.840
I came to see you before even going home.

00:15:17.399 --> 00:15:18.639
You really didn't have to.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.399
Gifts, gifts, gifts.

00:15:21.279 --> 00:15:22.399
These are all my...

00:15:22.399 --> 00:15:23.200
No need.

00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:24.440
These gifts are too precious.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:25.600
I cannot accept them.

00:15:26.639 --> 00:15:28.240
Why are you being so polite with me?

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.879
When my father was alive,

00:15:30.039 --> 00:15:31.279
he always reminded me,

00:15:31.519 --> 00:15:33.759
our Dong and Huo families are old friends.

00:15:34.159 --> 00:15:35.840
We must never be lacking in courtesy.

00:15:36.799 --> 00:15:37.240
Look.

00:15:37.399 --> 00:15:39.279
This bridal sedan chair is one I went to the provincial capital

00:15:39.399 --> 00:15:41.200
specifically to have custom-made.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.120
It suits you perfectly.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.120
It doesn't suit me.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.279
My house is shabby and small. It won't fit.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.320
That doesn't matter.

00:15:47.559 --> 00:15:48.720
On our wedding day,

00:15:48.799 --> 00:15:50.159
I will use this grand sedan chair

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.200
to marry you in grand style.

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:52.960
Xiu Gu.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.840
We have a guest.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.000
Who is this?

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:58.799
You don't know him.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.840
I suppose he's a relative of the Dong family?

00:16:02.039 --> 00:16:03.840
I need to know how to address him.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.000
Otherwise, it would be rude.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.480
Oh, my good son-in-law.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.240
Uncle Dong.

00:16:12.679 --> 00:16:13.360
Look at you.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.879
You've been gone for so long.

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:18.879
My daughter misses you every day.

00:16:18.879 --> 00:16:19.440
Isn't that right?

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.480
Don't talk nonsense.

00:16:20.639 --> 00:16:21.799
How is it nonsense?

00:16:22.039 --> 00:16:25.039
We've been longing for you like the stars and moon.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.840
Finally, you are here.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.279
Come, come. Please, please.

00:16:28.799 --> 00:16:29.320
Uncle.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.320
How should I address this gentleman?

00:16:31.879 --> 00:16:33.919
Address what? No need to address him.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.480
He is just our servant.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.519
What servant?

00:16:36.759 --> 00:16:38.039
He is my cousin.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.960
What cousin?

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.360
He is just...

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.039
a servant who chops wood and lights fires.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.440
Anyway, he is my cousin.

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.720
Let me explain.

00:16:53.639 --> 00:16:54.360
Well...

00:16:55.639 --> 00:16:57.200
Based on my age,

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.879
I should be Xiu Gu's cousin.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.399
Based on my looks,

00:17:02.879 --> 00:17:05.399
Old Dong and I are like brothers.

00:17:05.919 --> 00:17:06.559
And so,

00:17:07.919 --> 00:17:08.840
I should be

00:17:08.919 --> 00:17:10.160
Xiu Gu's cousin-uncle.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.079
As for the work I do,

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.960
I am also their servant.

00:17:16.759 --> 00:17:18.079
I should be their...

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.440
working servant cousin-uncle.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.880
Since it looks like you're engaged to her,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:24.559
Yes, yes, yes.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.119
you should also call me...

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:27.440
Fat Cousin-Uncle.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:28.720
Understood, understood.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:29.880
Whether it's

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.480
cousin or cousin-uncle,

00:17:31.839 --> 00:17:33.319
you are all relatives of the family.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.720
Your relatives are my relatives.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.200
So we are all one family.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.079
Then I pay my respects to Fat Cousin-Uncle.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.480
You are too polite.

00:17:45.279 --> 00:17:46.400
Well said, well said.

00:17:46.519 --> 00:17:48.000
One family, one family.

00:17:48.519 --> 00:17:50.519
Look, why so polite between family?

00:17:50.519 --> 00:17:51.200
Let's go, let's go.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.039
Come on, come on.

00:17:53.359 --> 00:17:54.279
Come inside and sit.

00:18:03.559 --> 00:18:08.759
A little nun

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:18.279
Just sixteen years of age

00:18:19.039 --> 00:18:25.480
In the prime of youth

00:18:25.519 --> 00:18:32.759
Sent into the nunnery

00:18:32.759 --> 00:18:37.240
To take the vows

00:18:37.759 --> 00:18:43.960
Day in and day out

00:18:44.519 --> 00:18:55.680
Burning incense and changing water

00:18:56.799 --> 00:18:57.640
Wait a moment

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.640
Troupe Leader Wen, someone is looking for you

00:19:03.079 --> 00:19:03.680
Who is it

00:19:03.799 --> 00:19:04.720
Seems to be

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.000
That widow from the Fan family

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:12.880
You are from Young Master Fan's household

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.480
I am his woman

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:16.720
My name is Yu Zhen

00:19:18.319 --> 00:19:19.160
You are

00:19:19.319 --> 00:19:20.400
Sha'er's master

00:19:21.599 --> 00:19:22.839
I wouldn't dare call myself his master

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.839
Young Master Fan is my benefactor

00:19:26.319 --> 00:19:27.480
He is a criminal now

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.039
And you still acknowledge him

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.519
I do, of course I do

00:19:31.319 --> 00:19:33.160
When I was in my direst straits

00:19:33.279 --> 00:19:34.559
He risked his life to help me

00:19:34.839 --> 00:19:36.440
He wouldn't save just anyone

00:19:37.039 --> 00:19:38.000
To him, you

00:19:38.279 --> 00:19:39.319
Must be very special

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.319
I just happened to sing an opera he liked

00:19:44.519 --> 00:19:45.799
That is also a kind of destiny

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.480
Then that destiny is between him and my husband

00:19:49.839 --> 00:19:51.440
Our troupe's repertoire

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.000
Is all chosen by my husband

00:19:58.559 --> 00:20:00.240
Actually, I came this time

00:20:01.279 --> 00:20:02.319
To ask for a favor

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.240
What is it

00:20:10.319 --> 00:20:11.200
Sha'er... he

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.680
Is not dead

00:20:13.039 --> 00:20:14.039
Not dead

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.640
Sha'er told me

00:20:16.039 --> 00:20:17.480
He considers you his true master

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.559
I'm just a woman, I can't travel far

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.279
But I know

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.440
The troupe travels everywhere to perform

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.039
When you go to other places

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.039
Please ask around for news of him

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.400
If you run into him

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.839
Could you help him if possible

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:34.480
Stop

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:35.799
Stop

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.000
Go

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:40.359
Stop

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:42.000
Go

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.000
What? What? What?

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.240
You knock over the water and think you can leave

00:20:51.319 --> 00:20:52.039
Get lost

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.279
I'm on official duty

00:20:53.599 --> 00:20:54.079
Come back

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.240
You having fun, kid

00:20:58.519 --> 00:20:59.319
You called me back

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.440
Either apologize or pay for the water

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.000
Are you tired of living

00:21:04.359 --> 00:21:05.519
Don't you recognize Regiment Commander Qin's soldiers

00:21:05.599 --> 00:21:06.640
I don't care what Commander you are

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:07.960
You have to be reasonable

00:21:08.319 --> 00:21:09.279
This is reason

00:21:11.039 --> 00:21:12.000
I don't believe

00:21:12.519 --> 00:21:13.640
You'd dare, right on the street

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:14.680
To beat me to death

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.440
What? What?

00:21:17.519 --> 00:21:18.440
Did you find him

00:21:19.559 --> 00:21:21.359
I told you not to cause trouble

00:21:21.799 --> 00:21:22.480
Go look, quick

00:21:25.759 --> 00:21:26.359
Fatty

00:21:26.519 --> 00:21:27.880
Those are Regiment Commander Qin's soldiers

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.480
Do whatever they tell you

00:21:29.839 --> 00:21:31.160
Quit acting up with me

00:21:32.119 --> 00:21:32.759
Found him yet

00:21:33.119 --> 00:21:33.599
No

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:34.839
Hurry, hurry! Up ahead

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.319
What a big official

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.920
Woodpecker official

00:22:17.799 --> 00:22:18.559
Who closed the door

00:22:33.839 --> 00:22:34.400
Come out

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000
I see you

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:45.440
Come out

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.400
Still trying to hide

00:22:53.279 --> 00:22:54.279
If you don't come out

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:55.640
I'll run you through

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:56.799
Hands up

00:22:57.799 --> 00:22:58.720
Hands up

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:05.559
You

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.279
Who are you

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:08.640
None of your business

00:23:09.599 --> 00:23:10.119
Back off

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:18.359
Brother

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.039
There's still one bullet in the gun

00:23:21.839 --> 00:23:22.759
Don't let it go off

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.519
I hate it when people point guns at me.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.119
An officer.

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.279
Then you bastard must be a deserter.

00:23:50.599 --> 00:23:51.920
You lied to me.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.200
There's a bullet in the chamber.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.279
You think I've never handled a gun?

00:23:57.079 --> 00:23:58.279
It feels light.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:23:59.759
One pull of the trigger...

00:24:03.039 --> 00:24:04.440
Quick, quick! Over there!

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:09.519
Don't move!

00:24:10.799 --> 00:24:12.680
Didn't you say you only had one bullet?

00:24:12.799 --> 00:24:13.880
All is fair in war.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:15.480
Move.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.000
Brother.

00:24:20.039 --> 00:24:21.039
I don't want trouble.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.480
I just want to borrow your place.

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.319
To lay low for a bit.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:25.440
Close the door.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.160
Those small fry soldiers.

00:24:32.799 --> 00:24:34.079
They're here to catch you, huh?

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:37.200
Regiment Commander Qin's troops are famously domineering.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.160
If they charge you with harboring a fugitive...

00:24:39.359 --> 00:24:40.759
Your whole family won't get away.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.000
As long as you help me survive this calamity...

00:24:45.079 --> 00:24:46.799
I will surely repay your kindness.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.319
Children of the Jianghu...

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.279
Never flake out.

00:24:54.359 --> 00:24:55.240
Send some men over there.

00:24:56.279 --> 00:24:57.160
The rest, follow me.

00:25:00.839 --> 00:25:01.519
What?

00:25:12.839 --> 00:25:13.839
Two of you, go up.

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:15.799
Come here.

00:25:16.119 --> 00:25:16.839
Hurry up.

00:25:22.759 --> 00:25:23.920
W-W-What is it?

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.200
Why is it you again, Fatty?

00:25:27.599 --> 00:25:28.480
Officer Woodpecker.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.319
Fate brings us together from afar.

00:25:32.839 --> 00:25:34.039
Have you seen anyone suspicious?

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:36.839
You barged in to watch me bathe.

00:25:37.079 --> 00:25:38.039
You're the suspicious ones.

00:25:38.799 --> 00:25:40.000
That loud gunshot just now...

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:40.960
Didn't you hear it?

00:25:41.079 --> 00:25:42.440
I thought it was firecrackers.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.559
Can't you tell firecrackers from gunshots?

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.240
I'm not a soldier like you guys.

00:25:47.519 --> 00:25:48.640
How would I know?

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.680
You're quite the alcoholic.

00:25:55.119 --> 00:25:57.920
Bathing in distiller's grains? Aren't you afraid of getting drunk?

00:25:59.039 --> 00:26:00.440
Bathing in distiller's grains...

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.000
Nourishes yin and strengthens yang.

00:26:08.079 --> 00:26:10.200
You damn fatty, did you just let one rip silently?

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:12.799
Detoxifies and beautifies the skin.

00:26:12.799 --> 00:26:14.440
Report! Nothing upstairs.

00:26:15.079 --> 00:26:15.839
Then go search ahead.

00:26:18.079 --> 00:26:18.759
Officer Woodpecker.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.359
Please close the door for me.

00:26:21.359 --> 00:26:22.319
I'm afraid of catching a cold.

00:26:23.079 --> 00:26:24.599
So much trouble.

00:26:34.279 --> 00:26:35.880
Brother, you are truly brave and resourceful.

00:26:36.599 --> 00:26:37.640
And loyal too.

00:26:38.519 --> 00:26:41.480
Children of the Jianghu never flake out.

00:26:42.359 --> 00:26:45.240
Seems like you've been around the block, brother.

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:46.119
Brother.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.200
Why are you in such a sorry state?

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:49.839
Betrayed by those close to me.

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:51.559
My army suffered heavy losses.

00:26:52.119 --> 00:26:53.640
If I can survive this calamity...

00:26:54.279 --> 00:26:55.759
I can regroup and rise again.

00:26:56.839 --> 00:26:59.319
I also hate those...

00:26:59.319 --> 00:27:00.799
Villains who betray their brothers the most.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:03.519
Exactly.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.119
I also detest those villains the most.

00:27:06.599 --> 00:27:07.599
Unlike you, brother.

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.359
We met by chance.

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:10.880
Yet you risked your life to save me.

00:27:11.359 --> 00:27:13.160
Brother, your righteousness reaches the clouds.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.920
If in this life...

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.759
I could have a big brother like you...

00:27:18.119 --> 00:27:19.720
It would be the fortune of three lifetimes.

00:27:20.799 --> 00:27:23.880
I've always loved making friends with heroes.

00:27:24.079 --> 00:27:25.839
You're upright, I'm straightforward.

00:27:26.079 --> 00:27:28.000
Let's become sworn brothers right now.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.079
I, Wei San.

00:27:33.519 --> 00:27:35.599
I, Fan Pengju.

00:27:35.839 --> 00:27:38.599
Share blessings, share hardships.

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:40.880
Fatty.

00:27:42.759 --> 00:27:43.640
Let me tell you.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:44.880
If you see anyone suspicious these couple of days...

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:45.880
Remember to report to me.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:46.799
Yes, sir.

00:27:51.519 --> 00:27:52.480
Does this actually work?

00:27:53.039 --> 00:27:54.160
It varies from person to person.

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.160
It works for me, but maybe not for you.

00:27:59.279 --> 00:27:59.839
Sir.

00:28:00.519 --> 00:28:02.200
Please close the door for me.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.960
Close my ass.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:13.920
He's gone.

00:28:14.839 --> 00:28:15.839
We didn't finish bowing just now.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.000
Let's continue bowing.

00:28:17.319 --> 00:28:18.000
No need, no need.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.680
We can just kowtow directly.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:20.440
Okay.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.079
From now on...

00:28:28.279 --> 00:28:30.319
...we are sworn brothers.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:32.599
Brother.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.200
Big Brother.

00:28:39.519 --> 00:28:41.319
Let us part ways here.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.000
All right.

00:28:45.599 --> 00:28:46.400
Farewell.

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:55.599
That won't work.

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:57.400
Looking like this...

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.039
...you'll get caught the moment you step out.

00:29:02.119 --> 00:29:03.400
Big Brother is truly Big Brother.

00:29:03.839 --> 00:29:05.400
You are cautious and wise.

00:29:10.319 --> 00:29:11.519
I need to think...

00:29:12.519 --> 00:29:13.960
...about how to...

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.759
...get you out of the city.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:17.720
Exactly.

00:29:22.079 --> 00:29:23.319
Come, come, come.

00:29:24.039 --> 00:29:24.480
Come.

00:29:26.039 --> 00:29:28.079
Go grab a bite at the tofu pudding shop ahead.

00:29:28.599 --> 00:29:29.799
Order some steamed pork belly.

00:29:29.799 --> 00:29:31.400
Have all the steamed rice you want. Go on.

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.400
Sure, sure, sure.

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.799
There's hard work ahead.

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.200
What are you up to?

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:43.880
I was thinking...

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.160
...you're about to get married.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.079
You should go out of town...

00:29:49.279 --> 00:29:52.359
...to visit your mother's grave and burn paper money.

00:29:53.039 --> 00:29:54.240
Take this bridal sedan chair.

00:29:54.319 --> 00:29:55.559
Let your mother see...

00:29:55.759 --> 00:29:57.480
...that you're living a very good life now.

00:29:57.599 --> 00:29:59.440
Put her mind at ease.

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.880
You sure are thoughtful.

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.640
Young Master Huo is thoughtful too.

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.920
I asked to borrow it, and he agreed right away.

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:05.920
I'm not getting in.

00:30:07.559 --> 00:30:08.240
Why not?

00:30:09.759 --> 00:30:12.119
Does this sedan bite your butt?

00:30:12.599 --> 00:30:14.519
Doing this is like selling me off.

00:30:15.319 --> 00:30:16.319
What do you mean?

00:30:16.599 --> 00:30:17.480
Can't you tell?

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.920
I don't want to marry him at all.

00:30:20.519 --> 00:30:23.839
Young Master Huo is educated and gentle.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.000
Why wouldn't you want to marry him?

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:28.240
I can't explain it in a sentence or two.

00:30:28.319 --> 00:30:29.119
Anyway, I'm not sitting in it.

00:30:32.079 --> 00:30:33.680
I've already borrowed it.

00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:35.920
Just sit in it for a bit.

00:30:36.359 --> 00:30:37.839
Consider it doing me a favor.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.680
What scheme do you have up your sleeve?

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.160
Just a trip out of the city.

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.000
As for the reason...

00:30:47.799 --> 00:30:48.799
...I can't tell you.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.759
As long as you agree...

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.640
...I'll repay you double in the future.

00:30:57.319 --> 00:30:58.559
It's not impossible.

00:30:59.599 --> 00:31:01.119
But if I help you this time...

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.039
...you have to help me next time.

00:31:03.359 --> 00:31:04.000
I definitely will.

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.680
A gentleman's word is his bond.

00:31:07.039 --> 00:31:08.599
Hurry up and get ready.

00:31:09.079 --> 00:31:10.319
We'll make it a quick trip.

00:31:27.079 --> 00:31:28.519
Let's go, let's go.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:29.240
Go.

00:31:30.319 --> 00:31:30.839
Hurry up.

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:32.319
I told them...

00:31:32.319 --> 00:31:34.319
...that I tied up a pig to take to the grave.

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.000
What are you saying?

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.119
You want me to pretend to be a pig?

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:41.799
Just bear with it.

00:31:41.799 --> 00:31:42.519
Fine, fine, fine.

00:31:46.319 --> 00:31:47.640
It's too small, I can't squeeze in.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.519
Just squeeze harder.
