WEBVTT

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.451


00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.350
Many things in this word,

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.630
if we make a mistake,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.570
we probably have
a second chance to fix them.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.430
We have the next semester
for exams.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.060
We have the next trains for BTS.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.439
Olympians have every four years
to retake the olympics.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.630
As long as we're healthy,
having hope

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.390
and courage to pursue our dreams,

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.120
We'll finally be successful
at the end of the day.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.130
What about love?
Do you think we have a chance

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.790
Come on, Nene. We're late.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.290
to turn back time and fix it

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.810
to be in love again
with the same one.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.800
Ton 5656.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.540
You look better than
your profile picture.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.220
- Do you want to do it now?
- Are you expecting someone?

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.800
No.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.870
Safety first. 54, right?

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:16.630
I'm 56.

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:32.030
Listen, I'll never sleep with
anyone else in this life.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.290
Sorry, let's meet again later.
I'm not ready today.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.940
If not, don't call me.
Delete your app for good.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.840
You smell bad.
Still have any energy left?

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.320
You just said you were tired
from playing basketball.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.960
When I see you, I'm reboosted.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.610
I can't help myself
when I'm smelling you.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.810
One more, please.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.210
- Won't you have a shower?
- I'll do it later.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.470
- Right here?
- Hold on.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.290
Come on, Kin.
We've been dating for years.

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.450
Safety first.

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.290
Don't you trust me?
Thinking I slept with someone else?

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:48.880
Who knows?

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:55.140
Listen, I'll never sleep with
anyone else in this life.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.810
Except you. I promise.

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.630
I trust you, but safety first.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.620
- Come on.
- Let's stop. Up to you.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.050
Tonight, I won't let you
go for sure.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.659
You don't need to buy
anything for me.

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:46.909
No, you train me to exercise
without any charge at all.

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:54.230
We're familiar neighbors.
The gym is the codo facility.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.780
I do it for you as a neighbor.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:10.870
Looks yummy. Nene would love it.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.230
Is she home today?

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:19.000
Yes, but she's slept early.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.800
On this trip to Japan,
I walked a lot.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.040
My legs are in pain.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.440
When we meet at the gym again,

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:37.100
I'll teach you how to stretch
after using your muscles too much.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:43.360
Here too. I'm so in pain, Than.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:49.730
May. May.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.500
Uncle.

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:57.070
What are you doing?
Why haven't you gone to bed?

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.590
Auntie May brought
some snacks from Japan.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:06.540
Hello. Remember me?
I'm on Floor 16.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.630
Hello, I do.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:13.080
Why did you wake up?

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.130
You should go to bed. It's late.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:21.690
I heard peple talking
so I came out.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:25.630
Let's see her off
and go to bed, okay?

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:28.310
I'll rub you hand
so you can sleep well.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:30.790
Are you leaving now?

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:33.940
- Well...
- Yes. Aren't you?

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.780
You had a long flight.
Please go back and take some rest.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.710
I'll teach you how to stetch
when we meet at the gym.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.360
Okay. I have to go.

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.430
Good night and goodbye.

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:49.120
Good nignt.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:06.170
You saved my life, sweetheart.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.490
Let's go to bed.
Wanna sleep in my room?

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.280
No, I want to sleep in mine.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.920
Sure. Let's go to bed. Come on.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.740
Uncle. Wake up.

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:41.470
Uncle.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:48.030
Go have a shower and get dressed.
It's my first school day.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.860
We can't be late.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.510
You've had a shower?
Washed your hair? Brushed your teeth?

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.200
Come on, I've done them all.

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.190
Can you get dressed on your own?

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.530
Sure, but you need to hurry up.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.210
Give me 15 minutes, okay?

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:19.230
Come on.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.180
Hello.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.140
I have no socks.
You haven't washed them.

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.230
- Please check the socks first.
- Sure.

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:57.770
- Do you want a bag?
- No.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.030
Okay.

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:27.090
170 baht in total.

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:37.800
Do you forget your wallet?

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.670
No, I'm sure I bring it with me.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.000
Where is it then?

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:47.990
- Can I pay by iBank?
- Sure.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:11.400
Uncle, is this your wallet?

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:15.310
Yes, thank you.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.020
Why do you have it?

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.840
Hold on, don't go. Please wait.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.840
- I'll have this one too.
- Sure.

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:31.140
Thank you.

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.960
- For you.
- Thank you.

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:36.250
Thank you.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:42.290
Hurry up, Uncle.

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:43.830
Grilled pork neck.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.190
- Thank you.
- Do you want carrot soup?

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:48.770
No, thanks. My son will be
just fine with the pork.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:49.960
- Okay.
- Thank you.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:58.070
Mawin, have you given the wallet
back to its owner?

00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.790
- I have.
- Good boy.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.990
Oh, what is in your hand?

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:05.460
The wallet owner gave me.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.260
Can I eat it?

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:10.070
Sure, but after school, okay?

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.490
You must eat this now.

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:21.500
Carrot soup. I'll give for free.

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:25.230
Thank you. Let's go.

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:42.110
- Let's go.
- This way.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.930
Your school is very beautiful.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.610
Please take her inside
after you fill it.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:54.530
- Hello, welcome.
- Hello.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.960
Which class are you in?

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:57.860
Mawain, K3.

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:01.490
Mawin. K3A?

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.070
- Correct?
- Yes.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.510
We have the document here.

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:12.880
Come on, Nene. We're late.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.640
- Are you excited?
- I am.

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:40.570
Kin.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.340
Can I fill it on the table inside?

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:51.430
Sure, please do.

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:53.440
Thank you. Let's go.

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:58.560
- It's hot out here.
- Which class is she in?

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:03.330
Oh, Nene, K3.

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:06.880
- Please check her name.
- Sure.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.390
There's an extra document
you need it fill.

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.130
Sure, okay.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:20.790
Here you are.

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:28.310
- In English here, please.
- Sure.

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:33.710
After this,
we'll take you and your parents

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:37.030
on a school tour
to introduce our rooms.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:43.170
All students get up
and follow me, please.

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:46.580
Come on, a row at a time.

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:54.020
And all of you will
follow your kids

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.300
to see what rooms our school has.

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.570
We'll go to the library,
the art room,

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.670
and finally the gym.

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:04.060
Okay, please come this way.
Follow your kids up there, please.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.540
This way, please.

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:14.099
Please follow your kids.

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:34.180
Your shoelace is untied, watch out.

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.970
Thank you.

00:17:58.270 --> 00:17:59.250
Please move aside.

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:01.640
I won't.

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:07.090
I said move aside.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:09.020
I won't.

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:18.730
I won't until you tell me
where you've been.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.310
Why did you leave me like that?

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:31.030
Do you know how I feel
when you're absent in my life?

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:35.800
It's like you never exists.

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:41.360
I wish it to go on like that.

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:44.600
So no one can block my way
like you're doing now.

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:48.680
Your wish won't come true.

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:53.690
Every time I tried to start
a new relationship,

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:57.390
I missed someone who left me.

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:05.880
Now I want to know the truth
from the one who left me

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.710
if he knows that
I miss him so much.

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.800
Mawin's and Nene's dads.
You're here.

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:19.790
I thought you were lost.
Please come inside.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:21.990
Okay.

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:29.390
Go inside.

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:31.870
Be careful.

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:15.590
Students, this is our gym.

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:18.060
It isn't only for sports,

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:22.160
but also for many activities
that need lots of space.

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:26.690
The next activity is ice breaking.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.640
You'll know each other better.
Both students and parents.

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:36.000
The kids are divided
into two groups.

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:38.600
And the parents stand
with the kids.

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:43.400
The rule is introduce yourself
to someone in front of you.

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:45.100
Then walk to your right.

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:49.440
The one on the far right must take
the positon in front of you.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:52.510
You get it? We have one more thing.

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:55.610
We have a song
and dance steps for you.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.530
Start with this side.
One, two, three.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:02.490
What's your name?

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:05.930
- My name's Nene.
- My name's Mawin.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.390
I like to do this.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.590
Go to your right.

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:27.680
Start with this side.
Ready? One, two, three.

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.790
What's your name?

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:35.210
My name's Nene.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:39.070
I like to do this.

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:40.230
Our turn.

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:43.690
What's your name?

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:46.880
My name's Mawin.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:50.660
I like to do this.

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:52.430
My name's Nene.

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:53.890
My name's Mawin.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:01.390
Start with the parents this side.
One, two, three.

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:05.710
What's your name?

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:09.010
My name's Than.

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:12.690
I like to do this.

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:16.110
What's your name?

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:19.440
My name's Akin.

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:23.190
I like to do this.

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:24.790
My dad is Than.

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:26.970
My dad is Kin.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.270
I told you not to call me dad.
They'll get me wrong.

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:34.110
I'm her uncle.
Thank you again for my wallet.

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:38.360
Nice to meet you again, Kin.

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:41.830
Nice to meet you, Nene.

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:43.990
And your uncle.

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:54.390
- Okay, to your right.
- Let's go.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.870
Hello.

00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:02.760
Hello, greet her mom.

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:06.890
Now you've introduced yourselves.

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:07.210
Yes.

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:13.690
Next, we have
a little active game, Chairball.

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:19.130
You can remember your friends
and practice group effort.

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:22.770
For parents, you can take a break
as you wish.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:35.520
Students, please follow me.

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.640
Parents. This way, please.

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:43.740
- Sit down.
- This way, parents.

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:46.460
This way, please come here.

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:52.390
Oh, can I have your contact?

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:56.800
We'll create a parent group.

00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:58.590
Thank you.

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:01.890
We'll create a parent group.

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:04.470
- Please scan to join it.
- Sure.

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:12.260
This is mine.
Same ID. Never change.

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:14.450
Thank you.

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:22.190
Have you joined the group?
Please scan this.

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:38.290
Go, Nene. Go for it.
Shoot. Well done.

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:40.610
She is my niece.

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:44.100
She's small, but she's good.
Does she eat a lot?

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:45.500
Yes, she does.

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.430
Nene.

00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:58.810
So high.
Why are you playing it like that?

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:04.300
Run, Nene, run.

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:09.290
Well done. Good job.

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:18.500
Come on, do it. Good job.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.760
It's okay. Try again.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.240
Go for it.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.510
Do you hurt anywhere?

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:39.460
Are you okay?

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:30.920
Are you okay?

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:33.800
I'm okay.

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:41.130
You weren't hit like the last time.

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:55.750
- Go for it, Nene.
- What's up, Fai?

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:01.340
Okay, I'm leaving the school.
See you in half an hour.

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:05.870
Excuse me, I have to go now.

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:09.340
- I'll pick him in the afternoo.
- Sure.

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:16.510
Mawin. Hey, sweetheart.

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:19.800
I have to go now. Fighting.

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:23.790
Watch out.

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:43.600
Go, Nene. Well done.

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:49.830
Hurry up, everyone.
Don't make any mistake today.

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:54.220
We're Beyond Perfect
House of Perfection

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:56.680
Hello, Too.
How much time do we have?

00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:00.560
8 for preparation, 37 for meeting.
Our client has other business.

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:01.670
Copy that.

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:09.300
AJ, How many time have I told you?

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:15.270
The client's glass must be of
the Danish Royal Copenhagen brand.

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:18.150
They don't use the same as us.
Change it.

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:21.740
Let me do it for you. Sorry.

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:28.830
Here it is, Too. Right this way.

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:33.440
Today we’ll serve the tea blend
that Mr. Don really loves.

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:34.330
Very good.

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:37.130
And for dessert,
we’ve got a mixed berry tart.

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:42.330
Topped with strawberry, berry, kiwi,
and mango from the North.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.320
Perfect.

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:49.500
Not just perfect,
it’s beyond perfect. Because we’re

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:53.280
House of Perfection.

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:01.090
Oh, 2 minutes and 20 seconds.

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:02.500
Mr. Don’s car is already out front.

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:07.230
Alright, everyone ready?

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:08.490
– Ready.
– Ready.

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:44.920
– Hello, Mr. Don.
– This way, please.

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:23.600
Alright then, let’s begin.

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:33.570
This is my latest project.
May I name the house?

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.250
– Yes.
– The Best One House.

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.460
I’m very disappointed.

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:43.490
Do you see any flaws
in this work?

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:50.190
There’s fruit stuck
on the model’s teeth.

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:52.740
And her lipstick is smudged
around the mouth.

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:57.790
Also, the photo’s retouched
so much it looks unreal.

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:01.540
– Yes, that’s it.
– Exactly.

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:07.490
Right. And this is why
we canceled all work with them.

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:12.340
Beyond Perfect would
never miss details like that.

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:15.840
You’ve seen our work before,
I believe.

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:20.360
– Car ads, milk powder, and…
– I know.

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:25.420
If I move The Best One’s
projects here…

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:28.600
Can you handle it?

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:31.800
– Absolutely, no problem.
– Easy for us.

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:33.680
– Right?
– Yes.

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:35.470
Good.

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:41.920
I heard this photographer
is in high demand everywhere.

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:45.580
This is Pond’s work,
a top-tier photographer.

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:48.030
He was born for this job.

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:51.650
Every shutter he hits
feels like magic.

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:55.470
The light, the shadow,
every detail...

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:59.150
It’s more than a picture.
It captures the product’s voice.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:03.160
Pond’s someone we know,
so we hire him a lot.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.710
He’s here to pick up
his check today.

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:08.830
If you want to meet him,
I’ll see if he’s arrived.

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:10.570
– Great.
– Good idea.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:19.170
Where is everyone? Too? Akin? Indy?

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.980
Meeting. Important client.

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.800
Everyone has to be there?

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:27.010
Yes.

00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:31.360
Pond actually came up
from the fashion scene.

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:35.300
When he moved to commercial work,
his eye became very unique.

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:39.260
People call him the young general
who wields a camera.

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:42.130
But he’s a bit artsy in person.

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.860
Skill-wise, I guarantee him.

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:48.420
True. Super cool,
totally hits the brief.

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:53.130
He’s here.

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:55.590
Hi, Pond.

00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:02.710
This is Donlapat. He’s our client.

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:07.020
A very important client
of Beyond Perfect.

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:14.640
I have a reshoot,
juice product, next Tuesday.

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:16.270
I want you to shoot it.

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:18.810
Any problem, Pond?

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:22.140
No problem.

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:25.690
Good. I want you for the shoot.

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:28.290
No problem. But I’m not going.

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:29.890
– Huh?
– Huh?

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:32.050
Why not?

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:33.560
Don’t feel like it.

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:40.400
Be professional, please.
If you’ve got no conflic,

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:43.980
Next Tuesday is booked,
it’s my sleep day.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:48.130
Sorry, important client.

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:50.010
Double the fee.

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:53.250
Sorry, I’m not motivated by money.

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:57.230
And rushed jobs, I don’t…

00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:58.310
Triple.

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:01.120
– Sorry—
– Five times.

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:07.710
Plus a van for gear,
Rabbit Love Studio, Ekamai.

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:10.659
Call time 10 AM to 8 PM.

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:19.300
Cash only. No checks.

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:26.449
For all other details,
talk to Mind, my secretary.

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:29.969
Everyone okay?

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.170
– Okay.
– Absolutely, Mr. Don.

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:36.010
If you’ll excuse me for a moment.

00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:38.230
Please, go ahead.

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:55.730
Pond, when this job’s done,
you’re buying drinks for us all.

00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:57.810
– I’ll book the place now.
– I’m in.

00:34:57.970 --> 00:34:59.200
You’re badass.

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:02.930
You’re crazy,
arguing with him like that.

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:07.310
– Nearly blew it.
– My hands were sweating, man.

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:37.830
You look good doing anything,
even taking a leak.

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:47.040
Rich people glow everywhere.

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:51.280
Everything you have
just looks good.

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.370
You’ve got bigger thing
than you know.

00:35:56.070 --> 00:36:01.440
Mine’s nothing fancy,
just simple stuff.

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:05.690
But when it’s needed,
it works just fine.

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:38.220
Then I’ll take
one blueberry yogurt.

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.390
Sure, I’ll get that ready for you.

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:43.070
Give me lots, okay?

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:48.440
– Mawin, go ahead.
– Thanks.

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:49.710
My treat today.

00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:53.700
Can I get Apple–Sugus
flavored ice cream?

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:55.280
Sure, one moment.

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:56.820
Aren’t you eating?

00:36:56.850 --> 00:37:01.430
– I am. One Thai milk tea.
– Coming up.

00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:08.450
Your dad is really late today, huh?

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.540
He’s coming. Teacher said so.

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:17.110
Eat a lot so
you’ll grow big and strong.

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:19.640
Sorry I’m late.

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:23.400
It’s fine.
Uncle and Nene kept me company.

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.860
He even bought ice cream for me.

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:30.740
Another Thai milk tea, please.

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:34.270
Same flavor you used to like.

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.190
I’ll take chocolate.

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:40.260
Why aren’t you getting Thai tea?
You usually...

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:41.800
Don’t feel like the same flavor.

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:45.820
Same flavor’s still great,
just saying.

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:50.720
Okay.

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:55.010
It’s on me.
You treated me plenty before.

00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.810
Thank you.

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:02.810
Let’s go.
Time to head home.

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:05.530
– Say thank you to him.
– Thank you!

00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:08.310
Hold on, Mawin’s dad.

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.650
How are you two getting home?

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:16.360
Skytrain.
It’s right next to our condo.

00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:20.250
I’ve got a car.
Come with me, it’s on the way.

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:21.740
How do you know it’s on the way?

00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:26.140
Yeah, how’d you know
where Mawin lives?

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:27.650
Exactly.

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:32.500
Anywhere’s “on the way”
if you want it to be.

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:35.830
No need. Don’t trouble yourself.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:36.810
It’s no trouble at all.

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:40.770
Come with us.
It’s harder for you to go alone.

00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:46.170
Skytrain’s packed
around this hour, right?

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:49.890
True, it gets crowded and stuffy.

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:52.930
I’m tired from activities already.

00:38:54.780 --> 00:39:00.610
Mawin, My uncle's car
is super comfy. Wanna try?

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:05.370
My dad has a car too,
just didn’t drive today.

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:10.490
Then come with us.
Really, it’s no trouble.

00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:13.970
Yes, not a bother at all.

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:18.240
Alright, Nene.

00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:30.520
– Yeah?
– Branch 2 is fully done now.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.870
You wanna come check
if everything’s done?

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:37.460
You handle it, I trust you.
I'm picking Nene up now.

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:40.070
I’ll come check tomorrow
first thing.

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:43.370
- Fine
- Thanks. See you.

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:50.440
My car’s right over here.

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:51.710
Lead the way then.

00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:56.070
Let’s go.

00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:12.310
Mawin, thank her uncle
for giving us a ride.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.270
- Thank you.
- Sure.

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:18.200
Uncle, I need to pee.

00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:20.890
Come on, I drove you here.

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:24.440
My niece needs the toilet.
You won’t help her?

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:28.570
Really, I really need to pee.

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:32.160
Can you hold it, Nene?
Not anymore?

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:34.010
No, I can't hold it.

00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:38.480
Use the lobby restroom.

00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:41.520
Okay.

00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:04.760
Uncle, I can’t hold it.
Please help me.

00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:08.010
What do I do? I need to pee so bad.

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:25.030
- Bathroom’s on the right.
- Thank you.

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:34.460
Put your bag away
and change clothes.

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:35.290
Yes.

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:37.340
Don’t forget today’s clothes
go in the basket.

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:39.780
- I won’t forget.
- Let’s go.

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:53.460
Don’t get too comfy in my place.

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:59.260
This is my room, not yours.
Nene’s just using the toilet.

00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:15.610
Seeing this, I miss it.

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:17.980
Miss what?

00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:25.120
Happy birthday to you.

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.240
Make a wish.

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:33.360
Thanks so much.

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.010
Happy birthday, Than.

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:50.940
I’m 18 this year.

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:53.300
Yeah, I know.

00:42:54.600 --> 00:43:00.100
And being 18 means
if you do anything to me,

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.290
you’re not breaking any laws.

00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:06.030
You’re naughty.

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:09.770
Why not take the chance
now that it’s here?

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.830
You’re bold now, huh?

00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:18.190
I’m grown now.
Back then, maybe it was just...

00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:19.280
Enough.

00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:40.510
If you won’t start,
an 18-year-old can.

00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:47.810
A high-schooler agreed.
Would a college guy resist?

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:21.450
Don’t dig up the past.
It won’t help anything.

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:27.020
It will,
because I still want to know

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:31.780
why you vanished from
my life without a word.

00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:38.110
Did you think making someone
love you then leaving is fun?

00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:42.270
And now you have a kid,
so back then, you...

00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:46.310
Stop talking nonsense.
Our story ended long ago.

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:51.340
We never even broke up.
How could it be over?

00:45:54.960 --> 00:46:00.800
I'm done. Thanks, Uncle Kin.
Your bathroom's so clean.

00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:02.120
Sure.

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:07.860
You may head home now.

00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:10.680
Let's go.

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:18.240
Put your shoes on first.

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:24.580
Thank you.

00:46:56.260 --> 00:47:02.500
Uncle, this condo has
a playground and pool too.

00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:03.780
That's nice.

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:06.460
And it’s close to my school.

00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:10.470
- You like it here?
- Yes, I do.

00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:22.430
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:29.610
- Hello, Please take care of him.
- Sure.

00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:31.710
- Study well, okay? Bye.
- Okay.

00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:34.320
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:39.000
Kin.

00:47:44.090 --> 00:47:46.180
- Oh, Nene.
- Hello.

00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:48.400
Hello, hello.

00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:50.850
- Ready?
- Study hard, okay?

00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:28.190
- Study and have fun.
- Mawin.

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:33.070
Want ice cream? I will buy it.

00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:35.770
Let’s go home, Mawin.
It might rain.

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:40.740
No?

00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:44.170
Oops, it spilled.

00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:17.500
Let's go.

00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:22.950
What are we running from?

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:26.990
True, we don’t need to run at all.

00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:29.060
Let’s go.

00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:43.840
- Dad.
- Yes?

00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:55.680
Hello, Mawin’s dad.

00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:59.070
Since our kids go
to the same school,

00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:02.040
Let me be your neighbor too.

00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:07.870
Such a coincidence,
our rooms are opposite.

00:50:29.530 --> 00:50:33.030
A new fitness club
just opened here.

00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:36.530
Hello! I’ll take care of you
to perfection.

00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:40.870
I’m not single.
My status is just unclear.

00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:44.440
You’ve been hurt before,
be careful this time.

00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:46.030
Is that encouragement?

00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:49.700
Nice to meet you,
my special customer.

00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:52.070
Don. My name’s Donlapat.

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:54.300
Let me kiss you.

00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:58.890
I missed you.
I won't let you go.
