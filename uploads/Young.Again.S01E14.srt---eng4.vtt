00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.420
You haven't washed in three days, your head is all greasy.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.459
What are you watching?

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.620
You don't even have any hair.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.379
I don't know why you even bother washing.

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:11.939
Don't.

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:13.259
I'm watching this right now.

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:14.500
I don't understand that one.

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:16.620
We can both understand this one.

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:18.819
Seek common ground while reserving differences, get it?

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.099
I don't. Give it to me now.

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:20.699
Stop it.

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.219
The TV is public property.

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:23.340
It's not just yours.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.020
What are you doing?

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.099
Trying to hog it all?

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:26.979
Is that even relevant?

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.500
Give it to me, quick.

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:29.580
I haven't finished watching yet.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.219
Go ahead and watch.

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:31.379
No one is stopping you.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.620
I want to watch the program that was just on.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.060
Look at you acting all entitled.

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:37.099
What do you want?

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:38.860
You think you can just watch whatever you want?

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.379
Who do you think you are?

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:41.099
No...

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.939
You are simply unreasonable.

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:49.340
Surrendering so soon?

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.259
That's not your style.

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.180
You should at least put up a fight.

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.300
Let's watch together, together.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.939
I won't wallow in the mire with you.

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.060
How can you call it wallowing in the mire?

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.340
You should say we're birds of a feather.

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:04.939
That's not right either.

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:07.259
It should be...

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.060
Shared interests.

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:10.060
You?

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.180
Share interests with me?

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.020
You're really overestimating yourself.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.479
What are you doing?

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.340
What is wrong with you?

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:33.099
Stealing my book is like killing my father!

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.139
Give me a break.

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.219
Your parents died ages ago.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.860
It should be "stealing one's wife."

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.979
That's not right either.

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:41.460
You don't have a wife or kids.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.479
It's a metaphor!

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.780
It means...

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:46.219
Forget it.

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:48.060
I can't teach a blockhead like you.

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:49.340
Then let me teach you.

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:50.620
You teach me?

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.139
What a joke.

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:53.979
I'm a professor from a top university.

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:55.259
Retired.

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:57.060
You're just an uncultured boor.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.460
I went to college too.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.740
The "commune-to-commune" kind.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.699
In my eyes, you're just illiterate.

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:03.500
Fine.

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:05.219
Even if I'm not as learned as you,

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.259
I have this in my hand.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.180
I have legs.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.780
What use are legs?

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:15.699
Can legs control the TV?

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.819
That would be amazing.

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:18.180
Oh my god.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.459
If I have legs, I can walk away.

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.139
I never want to see you again!

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:23.459
You think you can just avoid me?

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:25.220
We live under the same roof.

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:26.220
How can we avoid it?

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.579
What are you doing?

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:31.699
Li Jianguo.

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:33.819
Death before dishonor.

00:04:34.019 --> 00:04:35.980
Translated into Chinese you can understand:

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.579
"Even a worm will turn."

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.579
Death before dishonor.

00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:41.379
I can understand that phrase.

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:42.740
Oh my god.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.019
Xiao Cai.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.660
Someone's knocking.

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:49.060
Coming.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:51.779
What is it?

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:53.339
Are you reporting a death or something?

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:55.579
Come in.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.259
Professor Fan.

00:04:57.899 --> 00:04:58.860
You... you...

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:00.459
What's going on?

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:02.819
Are you moving in right now?

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:04.620
Oh, I'm a bit of a third wheel.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.980
Should I clear out for you?

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.100
Xiao Cai.

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:09.660
Don't talk nonsense.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.980
Who knows who'll be the one clearing out.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.980
Professor Fan.

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:14.540
Is something the matter?

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.339
Or who are you looking for?

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.819
Look, look, Xiao Cai.

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:23.379
Professor Fan, you're not mistaken, are you?

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.300
You're skipping the beautiful Ms. Liu,

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.180
and looking for me?

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:27.060
This matter...

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.379
I have to discuss it with you.

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:29.899
Ms. Liu won't do.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.740
What exactly is the matter?

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.620
I want to move to a different place.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.279
Swap with whom?

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:39.019
Anyone will do.

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:40.100
Even if you kill me,

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.779
I won't live with Li Jianguo anymore.

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:45.100
I've had enough.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.500
It's unbearable.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:47.420
To live with him,

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.420
I'd rather die.

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:50.819
Sit on my bed.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.800
Wait a moment.

00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:55.439
I don't quite understand.

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:58.439
Since Mr. Li and Mr. Fan have a conflict,

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.319
why don't you go resolve this conflict?

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:03.040
I am resolving the conflict.

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:04.600
I'm working hard on it.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.879
No,

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:05.839
I came to find you

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:07.920
precisely to resolve this conflict.

00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:10.319
But Mr. Li and I

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:12.720
have never had a conflict between us.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.800
Yes, so...

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.560
Professor Fan wants to swap with you.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.160
He, well, moves in here with you.

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:20.600
The two of them,

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.420
won't see each other,

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.879
so they won't be able to quarrel, right?

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.079
Miss Cai,

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.519
this method of yours

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:27.199
is not resolving the conflict,

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:27.839
but rather

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:29.800
escaping the conflict.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.439
To resolve a conflict,

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:33.120
well,

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.300
one should first find a conflict.

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:36.759
No,

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.000
I mean,

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:39.199
first

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:41.439
identify the conflict,

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:42.240
then

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.519
resolve it from a logical level.

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:47.519
Just give me a straight answer.

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:49.680
Are you willing to swap or not?

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.519
This

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.160
requires Mr. Fan himself

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:57.959
to come and negotiate with me.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.939
Good heavens,

00:06:58.939 --> 00:06:59.720
it's not two countries sending troops,

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.160
why do we need negotiations?

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.279
How about this,

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.000
whatever you want to negotiate, talk to me.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.120
I am now Professor Fan's

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.199
plenipotentiary ambassador.

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:10.819
Then please show me his authorization,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.399
let me see it.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.600
I still need authorization?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.420
Is verbal okay?

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.800
Authorization is necessary.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.120
It must be written,

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:23.319
and have his personal signature to be valid.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.639
Anyway, where is he right now?

00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:28.720
Ms. Liu took him outside

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.240
to negotiate with others.

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:32.720
We have to walk on two legs.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.980
We can't hang ourselves on a single tree.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.079
Why hang himself?

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.839
Does he want to commit suicide?

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.480
Later,

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.439
the Eighth Route Army's armed working team

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.720
completely annihilated this group of devils.

00:07:49.079 --> 00:07:49.879
It's just that

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.920
our Comrade Fan

00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:52.920
suffered heavy...

00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:55.240
suffered light injuries.

00:07:56.279 --> 00:07:57.839
The military sub-district commander decided

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.519
to let him stay here with you temporarily.

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:02.360
After his injuries heal,

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.839
let him go find the troops.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.339
This person looks so familiar.

00:08:09.399 --> 00:08:10.639
You recognized him?

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:12.759
Easy to recognize with glasses.

00:08:13.399 --> 00:08:15.680
Isn't this the devils' interpreter?

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.279
No,

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.759
he is not the devils' interpreter.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.319
He is one of us.

00:08:29.399 --> 00:08:31.600
Does the military sub-district have other missions?

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:33.080
No more.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.440
Just let him stay here with you for a while.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.360
Right.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.600
You must guarantee his safety.

00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:54.200
Let me introduce you

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.159
This is Uncle Gou of our Yangliu New Village

00:08:58.519 --> 00:09:00.120
A pioneer in resisting Japan and saving the country

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.480
And this is

00:09:01.639 --> 00:09:02.440
Professor Fan

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.360
Where are you hurt?

00:09:05.759 --> 00:09:06.720
Let me see

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.120
I'll get some herbs to apply on it

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.480
No, I'm not injured

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.759
Internal injuries

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.519
Uncle Gou

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.679
I'm leaving him in your hands

00:09:20.679 --> 00:09:21.600
I'm off

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.000
Guaranteed to complete the mission

00:09:26.519 --> 00:09:27.320
Good

00:09:27.639 --> 00:09:29.240
Wait for the day of victory

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:33.960
Don't go

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.840
Don't leave

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:35.960
You're just going to

00:09:36.279 --> 00:09:37.200
Hand me over to him?

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.639
He is a fortress household

00:09:38.759 --> 00:09:39.720
Reliable

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.039
Follow me

00:10:01.799 --> 00:10:03.960
If you ask me, you shouldn't bother with him

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.440
Look how old he is

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.080
Threatening to cut you off at the drop of a hat

00:10:07.519 --> 00:10:10.759
He said he wants to find a suitable tree

00:10:10.759 --> 00:10:11.559
To hang himself

00:10:11.559 --> 00:10:12.919
He's just scaring you

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.919
Let him try dying, I'd like to see it

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.360
The sky will rain

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.480
People want to commit suicide

00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:18.480
No one can stop it

00:10:18.519 --> 00:10:19.759
That's not quite right, is it?

00:10:19.759 --> 00:10:20.600
It should be

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.240
The sky will rain

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.840
Mother hopes to marry again

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.360
I know this idiom

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.879
Is this an idiom?

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.600
I suppose so

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.639
The sky will rain

00:10:30.639 --> 00:10:31.960
A mother will marry

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.960
Right, it's about the same as remarriage

00:10:40.159 --> 00:10:41.159
Uncle Gou

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.360
Your house

00:10:43.039 --> 00:10:44.159
The fortress household?

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.679
Seems to be over there

00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:46.600
My house

00:10:46.799 --> 00:10:48.799
Was burned down by the Japanese devils

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.320
I'm not done with those little devils

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.000
Uncle Gou

00:11:06.639 --> 00:11:08.360
Where are you taking me?

00:11:08.679 --> 00:11:09.679
To heal your wounds

00:11:09.879 --> 00:11:11.120
Don't expose yourself

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.000
Uncle Gou

00:11:22.279 --> 00:11:23.200
Are you

00:11:23.799 --> 00:11:25.480
Playing guerillas with the devils again?

00:11:31.159 --> 00:11:32.080
Professor Fan

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.440
You joined the resistance team too?

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.360
You brought another one out

00:11:58.879 --> 00:12:00.080
Where is this?

00:12:00.559 --> 00:12:02.039
Why don't I recognize it?

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:02.720
Then

00:12:02.759 --> 00:12:03.779
Then what do we do?

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.399
Don't be afraid

00:12:08.799 --> 00:12:10.840
We believe in the masses

00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:13.440
We believe in the organization

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.279
Any difficulty can be...

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.799
So what do we do?

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.639
I remember your house seems to be in that direction

00:12:23.759 --> 00:12:25.419
Why don't we go check over there?

00:12:26.759 --> 00:12:28.000
You recognize my house?

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.720
Why didn't you say so earlier?

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.360
Follow up

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.179
Forward

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:40.639
Go straight

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:46.639
Keep going forward

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.200
Comrade Old Fan, don't go

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.799
It's dangerous outside, there are devils

00:13:05.519 --> 00:13:07.120
I won't trouble Uncle Gou

00:13:07.519 --> 00:13:08.440
Comrade

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.759
My injuries have already healed

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.600
I'd better go catch up with the troops

00:13:13.039 --> 00:13:15.360
Then you must wait for me to put on my pants

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.240
To provide you cover

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.799
What are you doing?

00:13:22.799 --> 00:13:23.480
Shh

00:13:23.879 --> 00:13:25.320
I'm watching out for devils

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:26.960
Devils?

00:13:27.399 --> 00:13:28.720
Are you talking about me?

00:13:29.159 --> 00:13:29.960
No

00:13:30.159 --> 00:13:31.480
I meant the Japanese

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.399
Can we talk inside?

00:13:33.539 --> 00:13:34.679
Come

00:13:49.679 --> 00:13:51.240
I just want to change rooms.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.600
That's not too much to ask, is it?

00:13:52.639 --> 00:13:55.080
Not at all. That's a very low bar.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.759
Even a nobody like Mr. Liang...

00:13:57.759 --> 00:14:00.039
...can have a single room.

00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:01.840
I believe...

00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:04.080
Hey.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.080
You foreigner, why don't you learn the good stuff?

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.559
You sure learned how to gossip fast.

00:14:09.799 --> 00:14:11.559
I didn't make anything up about you.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.159
It is Professor Fan...

00:14:13.159 --> 00:14:15.279
...and his roommate, Mr. Li.

00:14:15.279 --> 00:14:16.320
They really are...

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.639
...unable to coexist peacefully.

00:14:18.679 --> 00:14:21.120
He came here seeking refuge.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.000
Is that so?

00:14:23.039 --> 00:14:23.840
Lao Fan.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.039
What for?

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.159
It's a long story.

00:14:27.679 --> 00:14:28.879
Too numerous to mention.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:30.879
That Lao Li...

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.960
He smacks his lips when he eats.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.399
He doesn't wash his hands after using the toilet.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:35.799
He lectures people all day long.

00:14:35.799 --> 00:14:37.080
And he brags whenever he opens his mouth.

00:14:38.559 --> 00:14:39.519
Sounds about right.

00:14:39.519 --> 00:14:40.399
Who is it?

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.080
The main thing is...

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.480
When he sleeps...

00:14:43.879 --> 00:14:44.879
He snores and makes weird noises.

00:14:44.879 --> 00:14:45.759
He talks in his sleep.

00:14:46.039 --> 00:14:47.879
He burps, farts, and grinds his teeth.

00:14:48.399 --> 00:14:49.519
Who could stand that?

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.879
No wonder his wife died early.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:54.960
I reckon...

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.879
...she died from lack of sleep.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.440
She must have been exhausted.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.480
That really is unbearable.

00:15:00.879 --> 00:15:02.480
So, what do you plan to do?

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.639
So we decided...

00:15:04.759 --> 00:15:07.000
...to ask you and him...

00:15:07.279 --> 00:15:08.559
...to swap rooms.

00:15:08.639 --> 00:15:10.120
You live with Mr. Li.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:12.879
Darn it.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.240
I couldn't stand that either!

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:15.899
No...

00:15:16.159 --> 00:15:16.840
Besides...

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.720
...why are you making decisions for me?

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.399
How about...

00:15:19.519 --> 00:15:22.039
...let Professor Fan sleep in your bed?

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.480
Two grown men...

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.159
...sleeping in the same bed?

00:15:27.559 --> 00:15:28.720
Is that appropriate?

00:15:28.879 --> 00:15:32.200
Or you could sleep on the living room sofa.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.559
Why should I?

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.360
That's even less appropriate for me.

00:15:35.399 --> 00:15:36.480
Alright, you two.

00:15:36.799 --> 00:15:37.480
Stop arguing.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.000
I'll sleep on the sofa.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.000
Sleeping anywhere...

00:15:41.159 --> 00:15:43.080
...is better than listening to Lao Li snore.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.720
What's that noise?

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.240
People might think

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.080
someone's renovating in the middle of the night.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.159
I thought it was

00:16:08.159 --> 00:16:10.159
a John Deere tractor.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:14.360
See that?

00:16:14.519 --> 00:16:15.559
As soon as I came out,

00:16:15.559 --> 00:16:16.960
he stopped.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.679
I think I played a part.

00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:28.240
It's worse than snoring.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.519
It sounds

00:16:29.519 --> 00:16:31.960
a bit like our German language.

00:16:38.639 --> 00:16:40.440
You'd better stick to sleep-talking.

00:16:40.519 --> 00:16:41.799
In Germany,

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.360
in our folklore,

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.399
there is something called a werewolf.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.120
It's a werewolf.

00:16:48.519 --> 00:16:49.919
On the night of a full moon,

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.440
that teeth grinding...

00:16:51.879 --> 00:16:53.240
He turns into a wolf

00:16:53.399 --> 00:16:54.720
and comes to eat people.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.399
Come here.

00:16:55.679 --> 00:16:58.000
Come check if the moon is full.

00:16:58.279 --> 00:16:59.960
Don't scare people like that.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.559
Can we get any sleep tonight?

00:17:08.279 --> 00:17:09.319
Morning, you two.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:10.460
Not...

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:11.519
Not as early as you.

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:12.400
Good morning.

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:13.839
What's good about it?

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:15.079
I got up late.

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:17.599
A night without Li Jianguo's snoring

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:19.200
makes for a comfortable sleep.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.599
You slept comfortably all night,

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:23.759
but for us,

00:17:23.799 --> 00:17:24.799
it was miserable.

00:17:24.799 --> 00:17:25.519
What?

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:27.319
Last night, you...

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:28.519
that snoring...

00:17:28.519 --> 00:17:30.359
was extremely loud.

00:17:30.559 --> 00:17:31.359
What?

00:17:32.059 --> 00:17:32.559
I...

00:17:33.119 --> 00:17:34.519
I really snore?

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.319
I always thought Li Jianguo was slandering me.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.200
No wonder, it's not easy for Li Jianguo either.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.279
Other people are devils.

00:17:42.599 --> 00:17:44.359
Other people are devils.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.279
That's a famous quote from your German philosopher.

00:17:47.279 --> 00:17:48.039
No.

00:17:48.079 --> 00:17:50.039
It's the French existentialist master,

00:17:50.039 --> 00:17:51.960
Jean-Paul Sartre who said it.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.640
What he meant was,

00:17:53.799 --> 00:17:57.920
the people around you are the devils you hate the most.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.680
No, what does he mean?

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.160
He means I'm a devil too?

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.400
Lao Lu!

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.319
You come back here!

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:07.160
Come back!

00:18:07.299 --> 00:18:07.640
No, wait...

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.720
You explain yourself!

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:09.960
Who is the devil?

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.799
The Empress Dowager has arrived!

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.680
The Empress Dowager has arrived!

00:18:18.019 --> 00:18:19.039
Come.

00:18:20.319 --> 00:18:21.119
Grandma.

00:18:22.839 --> 00:18:24.319
Please help mediate.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.839
You two silly children.

00:18:27.839 --> 00:18:29.759
The older you get, the less sensible you are.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.220
It's such a small matter.

00:18:33.839 --> 00:18:35.200
Isn't it just because...

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.000
Because of what again?

00:18:37.079 --> 00:18:38.000
Because...

00:18:38.839 --> 00:18:39.880
I forgot too.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.079
Exactly.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.359
So what?

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.359
Is it worth it?

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.119
You even want to run

00:18:47.279 --> 00:18:48.680
away from home.

00:18:49.519 --> 00:18:51.319
I'm telling you,

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.440
once you walk into this village,

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.279
and live in this courtyard,

00:18:55.359 --> 00:18:58.160
we are all one family.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.839
We must all get along amicably.

00:19:01.839 --> 00:19:03.480
No one is allowed to fuss.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.319
The old lady has spoken.

00:19:05.319 --> 00:19:06.299
Hurry up and apologize.

00:19:06.539 --> 00:19:07.079
Right.

00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:08.839
Don't make the old lady angry.

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.400
Brother.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.279
I was wrong.

00:19:17.319 --> 00:19:18.599
Brother, I was wrong too.

00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:23.400
Now those are good children.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.279
Come, hold hands.

00:19:27.799 --> 00:19:30.119
Hold hands.

00:19:30.279 --> 00:19:32.559
Walk together.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.559
Be happy.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.440
And grow tall.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.000
Help!

00:19:49.759 --> 00:19:51.160
I really can't take it anymore.

00:19:51.299 --> 00:19:51.920
No.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.440
What's wrong with you now?

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.359
Even a statue has a temper!

00:19:55.359 --> 00:19:57.319
I really can't stand this Mr. Liang anymore.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:58.480
What happened?

00:19:58.680 --> 00:19:59.839
Are you running away from home too?

00:19:59.839 --> 00:20:00.380
Yes.

00:20:00.839 --> 00:20:02.680
Please help me find a room.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:04.400
Who is it?

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.200
Who... who is this?

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.920
You want to stay at our safe house again?

00:20:10.839 --> 00:20:11.440
Um...

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:13.400
You...

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:14.160
Oh my.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:15.740
Oh dear.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.119
Isn't this Comrade Norman Bethune?

00:20:21.079 --> 00:20:22.559
Who is Norman Bethune?
