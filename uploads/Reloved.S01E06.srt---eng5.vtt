00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.390
Bro, someone wants to see you.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.710
Let's start over again, Kin.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.380
Take it, he intentionally
bought it for you.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.000
- Bro, let's eat.
- Oh.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.050
Let's find something to eat.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.780
- Let's eat.
- So starving.

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:21.970
I really don't know
what I made you sad.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.250
I'm sorry no matter what it is.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.340
Please give me a second chance

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.289
to show you that I have never
stopped loving you

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.630
since the day we met

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.850
until now.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.900
I've never been with anyone else,
and I won't do it.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.150
You can trust me.

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:52.590
No need to answer me.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.140
Just take it.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.520
Then I'll know that
you feel the same.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.290
Let me be the one who's
try to win your heart again.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.970
Kin. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.680
I know you're not good at lying.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.560
Are we still feeling the same, Kin?

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.460
Everything has changed.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.820
Something in the past is
still lingering.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:05.730
But now,

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.030
we must forget it and move on.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.380
Can you really do that?

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.210
I'm always here for you.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.300
Please answer me,
I'm waiting to hear it.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.490
Almost noon, won't you go to work?

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:53.100
My day off.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:56.580
Have work today?

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:58.540
I had.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.510
It was just cancelled.

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.890
I'm free now.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.460
Day off means to rest.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.940
Let's go on a trip.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.500
A trip?

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.630
Yes, a date.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:32.700
Just give me a quick shower.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.060
Have you had it?

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.960
No.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:36.980
Let's have it together

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:38.170
Hey.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.280
Everything including that
is off today.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.400
I promise that I won't do it today.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.400
Let's have a cute date
and spend time together.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.760
What's that?

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.630
Can I really trust you?

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.090
- You said...
- No.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.400
This is just a moring glory.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:59.670
Let's have a shower.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.000
Come on.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.180
Valentine's Day
came so fast this year.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.060
No, it didn't.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.360
- Then why did he give you...
- Maybe...

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.090
He owns a flower shop?

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.350
I think this one is better.
You can eat it.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:30.810
I don't think so.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.130
Shut up, enough.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.390
Let me ask him. Kin.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.409
When did you date him?

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.550
Why didn't you tell us?

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.010
I heard he wanted to
win over your heart.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.960
You're so fast, bro.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.000
- AJ.
- AJ.

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:49.340
He tried to win over my heart
since the university time.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.580
Now we meet again,

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:53.860
so he wants to do once more.

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:58.500
You should accept his love, Kin.
What are you waiting for?

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.550
He is so cute.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.840
He has a good job and so kind.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.230
Don't let him do it so many times.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.700
Would it be okay?
Kin has his own family.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.040
Is Than trying to have an affair,
and making Kin cheat on his wife?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.670
Or you're single now, Kin?

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.550
Stop, enough.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.390
Mind your own business.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.850
You're bad, AJ. Such a nosy boy.

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.060
Eavesdropping is disgusting,
you know?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.160
- That's bad.
- Yes.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.840
Come on, let's eat something.

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:36.920
Yes, I've been starving
since I eavesdropped him.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.890
I'm starving too.
Come on, let's go.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.830
Okay.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.130
Kin, come with us.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.380
Give me a minute.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:45.970
- Okay.
- Let's go.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.400
- Let's go.
- We'll go then.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.960
Mind your own business.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:54.730
- You're nosy.
- That's not good at all.

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:56.710
Eavesdropping is a bad manner.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.289
Let's pick Nene and Mawin up
together this evening.

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:54.740
Trying to win
my ex-boyfriend's heart.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.260
I've been looking for you.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.020
Don't act slick.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:35.310
So what will you do
about the new product?

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:40.370
Find someone to do it.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:43.830
What did the brand say?

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:46.820
Don.

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:55.210
And the timeline?

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.210
Okay.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:00.400
That's fine.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.420
You can change the model--

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:08.110
Pond, it's my work.

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:08.900
Day off.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.440
Love each other.

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:14.600
But don't create a commitment.

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:19.160
And may love be like
the ever-changing ocean

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.100
between the souls of both of you.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:24.840
Fill each other's cups.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.150
But don't drink from the same one.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:30.060
Give bread to each other.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.540
But don't bite from the same piece.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:36.370
By Khalil Gibran.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:38.760
I've finished it for you.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:42.100
How many boyfriends have you had?

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:47.690
Three?

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:48.690
Zero.

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.040
Never had one?

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:52.520
Yes.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.800
Probably because of your behavior.

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:57.770
Hey.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:04.890
I don't think
being single is a problem.

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:09.110
You?

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.380
Lend me your fingers.

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:24.040
Can I count you in?

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:30.550
Acting slick again.

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.090
For everyone, AJ.

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:20.660
One, two, three, four,

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.200
five, six, seven, eight.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.270
You're giving all of us, bro?

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:31.110
They'll be fresh in the afternoon.
For energy boosting.

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:35.530
Oops, the cup with hearts.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:37.640
Is it for Too?

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:42.580
I know whom it's for.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.790
But a lot of hearts...

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:49.040
Won't Kin think that
you're a two-timer?

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:53.570
Yes, that's true. Remove them.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.470
That's good.

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:08.920
Help me, AJ.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:09.850
I will.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.420
Fai.

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:17.330
- Yes?
- Please take care of the work.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.240
Sure.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:23.980
Let's keep going.

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:26.350
This is for you.

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:29.590
Comes with someone's heart.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.940
AJ, where's the photo I asked for?

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:34.870
Will you pass the internship?

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.240
- My gosh.
- Will you?

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:48.750
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.050
Thank you, bro.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.750
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:59.780
Mawin.

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:01.280
- Dad.
- Uncle.

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:03.350
Hello, Dad. Hello, Uncle.

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:03.880
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:05.850
Hello, Uncle. Hello, Uncle Kin.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:06.970
Hi.

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:08.580
Look at this.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.330
I have one too.

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:13.830
What is it?

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.450
They'll hold
a New Year party at school.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:22.000
I was chosen to be the princess.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:23.090
Wow.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:24.700
I'll be Snow White.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.010
Wow. And you, Mawin?

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:29.990
I'll be the prince.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.980
But I have to find the costume.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.890
Oh, where will we find them?

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:41.930
So do I, Dad.

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:44.550
My costume must be under
the same theme as Nene.

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:45.930
We'll play in the same story.

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:49.360
Okay, let's find out
where to buy it.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:56.450
This royal guard will find them

00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:58.640
for both of you, your higness.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.720
Could you please
get in the pumpkin carriage?

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:05.860
I'll drive you home.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.960
Wrong story.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:09.530
Wrong?

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:10.990
This is Snow White.

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:13.570
Which one has
the pumpkin carriage then?

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.950
Cinderella.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:16.530
I see.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.800
Sorry. Okay, get in the car.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:21.850
- Let's go.
- My princess.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.160
Show me how to walk like a knight.

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:29.600
Snow White.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:48.160
I've just start making a move.
Only this close is enough.

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:50.180
Close your eyes, Nene.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.710
You too.

00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:59.550
I'm not seeing anything.

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:01.810
Neither am I.

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:31.720
Anything else?

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:33.400
Let's see.

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:37.670
I'll have this one.

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:46.280
Are you a kid?

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.360
It's just a smile.

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:52.190
And this one.

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:06.280
These are perfect.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:15.450
Let's go.

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:19.230
- Let me see some salad.
- Sure.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:22.710
Both of them.

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:25.540
Can you eat all of them?

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.490
Come on, we can eat them.

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:35.420
How many? Two?

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:36.970
Make it four.

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:40.880
Ones with lots of fat.
These are very little.

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.810
I chose a mix of them.

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:57.900
Come on, let's go.

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:04.950
Go have a shower
and do your homework.

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:06.740
I have no homework today.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.720
Neither do I.

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:13.080
That's good. Let's swim, okay?

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:17.690
Good, can I bring
the balls and swimming ring?

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:18.670
You can.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:23.010
Let's swim together, Mawin.
I have some colorfull balls.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.950
You had a running nose last night?

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:28.330
I'm fine now. My nose is okay.

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:29.810
I'm better now.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.060
Let him exercise sometimes

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.860
so he won't get sick
easily like you.

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:40.230
I'll give you 15 mins
to get changed.

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:43.010
See you down
at the swimming pool, okay?

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:44.560
- Okay.
- Okay?

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.130
- Okay.
- Okay?

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.920
Come on, counting down. Let's go.

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:52.920
Let's go.

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:56.340
Come on, let's go.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.850
You see?
Someone won't swim with us.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.680
My dad can't swim.

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:03.800
I wanted to teach him,
but he refused.

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:06.590
You've ruined the reputation of
dating a sports science student.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.510
You're just my ex.

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.850
No, we've never broken up.

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.050
And now I'm starting my move again.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:15.300
Let's go.

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:16.550
Mawin.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:18.410
Nene.

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:23.260
Mawin.

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:32.680
Kin.

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:34.490
What? Hey.

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:43.960
Are you okay?

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.000
I'm fine.

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:48.680
Ouch! Easy.

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:52.690
I'll apply some ice to it.

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:55.020
Wait for me here, kids.

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:06.270
- Hold this for me, please.
- Sure.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.940
I think you should
take your shirt off.

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:13.760
Help me then.

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.100
Thank you.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:31.740
Ouch! Easy, Than.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.190
Sorry.

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:38.140
Does it hurt here?

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:39.800
Yes.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.020
Need my help?

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.060
No.

00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:22.590
Have a seat.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:24.550
I'll show you my skill.

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:28.940
Thank you.

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:31.330
You're multifunctional.

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:34.690
You are a good photographer,
a good masseuse,

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:36.370
and a good chef.

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:39.240
I'm so good on bed too.

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:42.450
This is a cute date, isn't it?

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.480
- You mentioned that again.
- My bad.

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:37.780
Has Mawin gone to bed?

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:41.110
Did the ice make you feel better?

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:42.330
It did.

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:44.530
Let me check if it's swollen.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:46.530
No need to. I'm fine.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:47.630
Ouch!

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:49.570
I don't think you're fine.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:51.680
Sit on the sofa.

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:53.660
Come on.

00:23:58.180 --> 00:23:59.270
Take off your shirt.

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:05.040
If you're shy, I'll close my eyes.

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:07.410
I'm not.

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:27.050
Ouch!

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:30.540
Easy.

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.160
Sorry, come on.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.240
I'll apply the ointment.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.690
Ouch! Easy, please.

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:53.640
You see? You're in pain
because of hard training.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.820
The match is coming.

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:01.880
The entrance exam is coming too.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:06.520
I know you love basketball
but this exam is also important.

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:09.600
I'm not afraid of the exam.

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:11.430
I have you with me.

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:15.000
I've read almost all of
your summary.

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:19.370
Have you thought about where
to study if you don't pass it?

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.640
I haven't. I'll pass it.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.440
I will be your junior
in the faculty.

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:28.320
I'll be there waiting for you
every evening

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:31.080
to check if you date someone else.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:34.400
You're the one who'll become
popular once you get in.

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:36.640
I don't care about them.

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:41.330
I'm going to hang a big sign
saying I have a boyfriend.

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:43.890
He's in the Faculty of Visual Arts.

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:45.530
His name is Akin.

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:47.260
Ouch!

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:50.880
Easy, please. Ouch!

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:54.200
Ouch!

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:56.040
Easy.

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:58.150
I'm doing it gently.

00:25:58.760 --> 00:25:59.950
Are you trying to get my attention?

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.170
Enough. Go to your room.

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:06.450
A bit more.

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:09.360
It took too long.

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:10.720
Opportunist?

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:13.060
You caught me.

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:17.230
Get up.

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:19.150
Go to your room.

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:22.800
Kin.

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:27.740
Do I have a chance in
winning you over this time?

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:33.790
I don't know.

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:38.070
It's like still standing on
an old feeling

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:40.270
that has never been explained.

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:42.370
What do you mean?

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:45.130
I can explain all of them.

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:49.060
An explanation is a truth
we dare to tell.

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:53.280
An excuse is a distorted truth.

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:56.010
And a lie

00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:58.840
has no truth from the start.

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:02.990
If you don't intend to
tell the truth,

00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:04.750
don't call it an explanation.

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:07.320
The truth of what?

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:09.690
Well...

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:11.550
Oh.

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.060
Why haven't you gone to bed?

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:15.930
Why have you woken up?

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:19.940
I heard you talking,
so I came out to see.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.120
Uncle Than brought me the ointment

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:24.640
He's about to leave now.

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:27.420
Thank you.

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:29.230
We can talk later.

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:30.990
Sure.

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:36.350
I have to go.
Please take good care of your dad.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.760
Don't let him carry heavy things.

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:38.970
Got it.

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:41.530
- Have a good dream.
- You too.

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:44.800
Good night, Kin.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.630
Mawin, let's go to bed.

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:02.880
You need to go to school early.

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:04.100
Let's go.

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:24.600
Can I own a steak restaurant
if I lose my job?

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:26.090
You tasted it.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.380
You'll never lose it.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.780
You're on an upward trend.

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:36.340
Has Beyound Perfect told you
about the new product?

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:38.710
They have.

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:44.870
I'm so full. Thank you.

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:46.490
There's one more.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:49.750
The dessert must be followed.

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:51.910
Full course, isn't it?

00:28:55.590 --> 00:29:00.970
By the way,
can I serve it on the sofa?

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:45.880
Tonight's dessert won't be served
on a plate.

00:29:57.850 --> 00:29:59.930
Let me show you how to eat it.

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:24.860
Sweet bite.

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:35.610
I have an option for you.

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.410
My dessert is not very sweet.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.480
If you want it sweeter,

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:42.780
I have a dipping sauce.

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:05.750
Where's my cute date?

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:08.820
Just a dessert

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.040
that isn't on a plate.

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:12.950
Isn't it cute?

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:34.590
You're so cunning.

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:37.520
Don't you like it?

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:12.140
Who's cunning now?

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.540
This is a product from
Krajood Maliwan

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:21.909
by Milwan Khongkua.

00:34:21.929 --> 00:34:25.429
Is it Krajood from Cha-uat,
Nakhon Si Thammarat?

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.870
They've distributed
the work to the community

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:30.300
to make these beautiful
bags and baskets.

00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:31.429
Beautiful.

00:34:31.699 --> 00:34:32.600
Very chic.

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:33.800
- Yes.
- I like it.

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:37.929
The next one is made from
tie-dyed cotton fabric.

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:40.270
It was inspired by Nai Khanom Tom.

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:44.210
Various elements have been added
to make it look more modern.

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.030
- Very chic.
- Turn it around, AJ.

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:47.570
Show it to Too and Indy.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:51.040
- Wow.
- Oh, Thai boxing.

00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:52.670
Beautiful.

00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:54.620
And the next one.

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:58.700
This is a bag from Prawpha.

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:02.070
It's a combination of Thai silk
and premium grade leather.

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:05.230
It looks beautiful and expensive
at the same time.

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:06.950
- Okay.
- Do you like it?

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:09.200
Well... I like it.

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:10.400
Which one the most?

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:13.650
I think this one is
perfect for you.

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:14.910
I like small bag. This one.

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:16.600
- That's big.
- Small?

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:44.320
Does it healed? Let me see.

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:47.690
It's been a week.
Doesn't hurt anymore.

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:49.090
I can use my arm now.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:52.950
Sure? Okay, raise your left arm up.

00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:57.890
Bend your arm and touch your head.

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:00.040
Yes. How does it feel? Hurt?

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.980
No.

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:03.640
Really?

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:06.610
Okay, don't move your left arm.
Now raise your right one.

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:10.330
Yes, bend it to touch your head.

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:13.770
So? Do you feel any tension?

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.050
I don't.

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:21.310
Okay, wait. I'll take a photo,
so you can see how it is.

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:25.970
Saranghaeyo!

00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:28.220
Are you kidding me?

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:30.940
A little smile each day
brightens the spirit.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.540
We have to get the costumes
for the kids this week.

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:41.270
You can go there with me.

00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:34.970
Mawin.

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:48.800
Why do you bring us here?

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.390
Hey.

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.050
Grandma. Grandpa.

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:07.560
- Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad.
- Hi.

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:16.000
Is that Akin?

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:20.010
Yes. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad.

00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:23.000
Hi, long time no see. How are you?

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:24.090
I'm good.

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:25.890
How are you?

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:27.830
- We're fine.
- We're good.

00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:32.550
Oh, who is this young boy?

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.240
Mawin, greet them properly.

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:40.570
Hello, Grandpa. Hello, Grandma.

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:43.350
My name's Mawin.
I'm Dad Akin's son.

00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:47.490
- Oh, Mawin.
- I see, Mawin.

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:50.270
Too cute for your own good.

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.910
Why is he too cute, Grandma?

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:54.770
Can't he be just cute?

00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:57.720
We can't praise kids too much.

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:00.270
Ghosts would steal them.

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:07.730
Come on, let's have
a glass of water inside.

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:08.640
- Come on.
- Okay.

00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:11.600
Why did you mention a glass?

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:14.390
Can't we use other containers?

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:18.110
You're such a curious girl.
Okay, I tell you now.

00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:22.110
It is what old people like to say.

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:27.800
All of you wait here, okay?
We'll be back.

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:29.290
Just a while.

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:36.830
Is this home a nice place to live?

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:39.150
Yes, it has a garden.

00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:42.180
If you live here,
you can play in there.

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:48.380
That's my photo when I was young.
Was I cute, Uncle Kin?

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:49.900
You were very cute.

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:53.660
How about me? Cute or not?

00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:58.760
Tada.

00:39:58.950 --> 00:40:01.550
- Wow.
- Wow.

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:04.510
Is that for me?

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:05.680
That's right.

00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.890
So cool.

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:09.840
- Don't forget to thank them.
- Thank you.

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:13.760
Where did you find them, Grandma?

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:20.440
Your uncle told me to use my skill.

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:23.140
She sewed them herself.

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:25.720
It must be tough for you.

00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:27.630
No, not at all.

00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:30.530
When Than and Sun
had thier school parties,

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:31.670
I did it for them too.

00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:36.050
I sewed this new prince costume
for you, Mawin.

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:39.670
Wow. Can I try it on, Grandma?

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:41.300
Sure, you can.

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:43.150
Do you want to try, Mawin.

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:46.330
If it doesn't fit you,
I'll have her fix it for you.

00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:47.360
Okay, come on.

00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:48.750
Come on, kids.

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:50.960
- Come here.
- Here.

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:07.500
Do you want to go out and see
the bougainvillaea we planted?

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:25.850
It's been growing
while we went seperate ways.

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:29.210
Now we meet again.

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:32.580
It will probably bloom soon.

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.330
It's been growing.

00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:44.450
We've been changing a lot
since that day.

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:49.160
Not only us.

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:54.010
Many things
have changed since then.

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:13.030
Wow.

00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:17.490
You're good looking, Mawin.
Just like your dad.

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:21.040
Is he good looking like me?

00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:24.700
What are you talking about?

00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:27.720
You're beautiful like
a princess, Nene.

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:30.910
Just like me when I was young.

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:32.790
- Yes.
- Do you agree?

00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:36.270
Come on,
let's practice your script.

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:39.590
- Princess.
- Are you ready?

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:42.600
Once upon a time...

00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:45.350
Wow, so beautiful.

00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:50.890
There was a little princess
holding an apple.

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:16.840
Snow White.

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:19.750
Witch, I got you.

00:43:48.010 --> 00:43:52.760
Please give a big hand
for Snow White.

00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:56.290
Our performers are very cute.

00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.900
Come to the front of the stage.

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:04.420
Snow White ends now.

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:05.710
Great job, Mawin.

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:09.120
- Great job, Nene and Mawin.
- Come to the front of the stage.

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:11.000
Let's take a photo together.

00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:14.170
Come to the front
and stand in line.

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:18.850
Smile a lot, Mawin.

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:29.740
Please give a big hand for
all of our students here.

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:32.470
Please come and take
a photo with us.

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.120
Where are your parents?

00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:37.100
Come on, Mawin.

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:40.450
Come on, Mawin.

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:42.020
Take a photo with me.

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:44.670
Great job, Mawin.

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:46.810
Both of you were so great.

00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:47.990
You're good too, Nene.

00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:49.770
Where is Mom?

00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:52.180
She's probably stuck
in traffic around here.

00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:56.210
Such a shame. I want her
to watch me on stage.

00:44:58.060 --> 00:44:59.410
- Let's take a photo.
- Let's take a photo.

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:01.870
Come on, let's take a photo.

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:05.740
Let's take a break here
for a moment.

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:08.530
We have activity booths
all over the place outside.

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:12.630
Take your parents for a walk
and play at the booths together.

00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:15.450
We'll meet here again later.
Let's go.

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:18.180
I want to play
the balloon popping game.

00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:19.640
Me too.

00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:21.580
Then let's go together, okay?

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:22.460
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:23.840
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:25.620
Can I play it?

00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:27.870
You want to?

00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:30.850
Fine.

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:32.940
How much?

00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:34.470
100 baht. I'll scan it.

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.210
- You can take it.
- Thank you.

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:54.310
One, two...

00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:57.600
Almost.

00:45:58.420 --> 00:45:59.230
Mawin.

00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:00.960
One, two...

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:08.330
What do you want this time?

00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:10.990
That one.

00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:23.720
- Yeah.
- You got it.

00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:27.130
Do it again.

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:28.270
Here.

00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:33.950
Tag me.

00:46:40.310 --> 00:46:41.500
A bit right.

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:43.000
A little bit right.

00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:44.310
Okay.

00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:49.780
Watch and learn.

00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:55.850
What do you want to eat?

00:46:56.590 --> 00:46:57.870
I don't know. Let's see.

00:46:59.010 --> 00:46:59.840
What do you want to eat?

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:02.160
- I don't know yet.
- Really?

00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:03.710
Oh, Mr. Don.

00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:09.680
You like to shop in this mall too?

00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:14.500
Yes, I'm here with my friend.

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:19.410
I'm here with my friend too.

00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:24.870
Everyone comes here
with their friends.

00:47:39.310 --> 00:47:40.260
Let's eat.

00:47:56.290 --> 00:47:57.430
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:18.960
Dad, let's go to the stage.

00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:20.050
Why?

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:22.520
Come on, we'll be late.

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:24.870
Where to?

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:27.020
- Come on.
- What?

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:34.330
The next one is another show
from a parent.

00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:38.100
You've seen the magic show.
Let's change the mood now.

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:40.270
There's a beautiful song
waiting for us here.

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.460
Okay.

00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:11.130
I wrote this song a long time ago.

00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:14.100
I wanted to sing it to someone,

00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:16.100
but I never had a chance.

00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:19.110
Please allow me to sing it today.

00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:45.870
We had to part,

00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:49.390
without a reason clear,

00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:54.610
And though I tried,
I couldn’t hold you near.

00:49:56.200 --> 00:50:03.720
So many whys were left unsaid,

00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:09.110
Just silence where
your words once led.

00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:14.050
And meeting you again today,

00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:18.210
I realize, though years have flown,

00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:24.110
My heart’s still yours,
you’re still my own.

00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:29.490
It’s been so long
since last we met,

00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:32.660
Do we still feel the same way?

00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:35.850
Just like the days
we used to share,

00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:40.200
those memories linger everywhere.

00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:43.850
Tell me, love, are you doing fine,

00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:46.610
Let's start it over again, Kin.

00:50:47.290 --> 00:50:51.180
Do your memories still softly call,

00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:57.910
the way they whisper
through my walls?

00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:36.040
Kin.

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:50.630
That song belongs to you and me.

00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:24.570
Excuse me.

00:52:44.830 --> 00:52:46.390
Hello, Meya. Where are you?

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:50.310
Hello, this is
Ramkhamhaeng 2 Hospital calling.

00:52:50.810 --> 00:52:52.220
Pond? Are you alone?

00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:55.760
If I want to start over
with someone,

00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:58.890
but I don't know
if he's in relationship,

00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:00.360
what should I do?

00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:03.620
You're not ready to admit it,
or you're not ready to reveal it?

00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:06.240
We're just not right
for each other.

00:53:06.570 --> 00:53:08.830
You don't have any of
your family photos.

00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:11.160
If you want a long love,

00:53:11.850 --> 00:53:13.480
you must have a clean start.
