WEBVTT

00:00:01.815 --> 00:00:03.733
Stimulants, narcotics, cannabis.

00:00:05.068 --> 00:00:07.237
People who have used these drugs

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.865
are now estimated
to total two million in Japan.

00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:14.452
The number of people arrested
for drug-related offenses

00:00:15.036 --> 00:00:17.247
is as many as 14,000 yearly.

00:00:18.081 --> 00:00:20.416
Then get this over with quickly,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.293
police mutt.

00:00:22.377 --> 00:00:23.503
Get lost,

00:00:24.337 --> 00:00:25.839
Ministry mutt.

00:00:25.922 --> 00:00:28.341
You went off on your own again?

00:00:28.424 --> 00:00:30.426
You can't just be biting at everything.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.178
That's why they call you Mad Dog!

00:00:32.262 --> 00:00:33.930
Become my "S."

00:00:34.013 --> 00:00:35.557
You're mad.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.475
You'll be my dog from today onwards.

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.185
Don't you care about your child?

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:42.063
Don't just make shit up.

00:00:42.146 --> 00:00:45.191
He acts like a friendly,
upstanding guy on TV.

00:00:45.275 --> 00:00:49.112
But they say he drugs women
and has his way with them.

00:00:49.696 --> 00:00:51.906
- Make him a customer.
- Seriously?

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.034
Follow Matsubara's orders.
Meet Kaga and make him ingest cocaine.

00:00:55.118 --> 00:00:56.619
Get it on video.

00:00:56.703 --> 00:00:57.996
What?

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.999
How would I know
where Kaga does his cocaine?

00:01:01.082 --> 00:01:05.378
Plus, I'll get killed if Matsubara
finds out I'm connected to you!

00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:06.504
A Mad Dog!

00:01:06.588 --> 00:01:08.882
Doesn't that refer to Mr. Kurosaki?

00:01:08.965 --> 00:01:11.134
Kurosaki is the NCD's Mad Dog.

00:01:11.217 --> 00:01:13.219
Katsuragi is the police's Mad Dog.

00:01:14.554 --> 00:01:17.390
Is this allowed?
For a cop to be this violent?

00:01:17.473 --> 00:01:18.808
Shut the hell up!

00:01:18.892 --> 00:01:21.895
What you've been trying
to attack all this time

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.188
is the state's authority.

00:01:25.148 --> 00:01:28.526
You're a dead man.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.368
You're familiar with Hibiki Kaga,
a regional celebrity in Chiba?

00:01:37.952 --> 00:01:39.203
The former boxer guy?

00:01:39.287 --> 00:01:41.623
He's on national TV too, occasionally.

00:01:41.706 --> 00:01:44.459
He's too timid on those
for his appeal to come through.

00:01:44.542 --> 00:01:46.419
People in Chiba love him though.

00:01:46.502 --> 00:01:48.922
Who cares how well he does in Chiba?

00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:52.675
- But he's Chiba's star!
- He's a star only in Chiba.

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.762
I get Chiba's TV channels
at my place here in Tokyo too.

00:01:57.472 --> 00:01:58.765
You mean that Kaga?

00:01:59.265 --> 00:02:00.433
Yeah, I mean that Kaga.

00:02:02.018 --> 00:02:05.313
Kurosaki's report says
that he's been using drugs recently.

00:02:05.396 --> 00:02:06.231
What?

00:02:08.274 --> 00:02:12.320
Well, that's a surprise. I've never heard
any rumors of the sort about him.

00:02:12.403 --> 00:02:16.074
He's also suspected of making women
do drugs and have sex with him.

00:02:16.157 --> 00:02:20.036
Using his popularity to prey on women?
What a scumbag.

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:23.623
He should get on his knees
in front of every person in Chiba.

00:02:23.706 --> 00:02:25.208
As with Igarashi's incident,

00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:28.044
drug-related cases in showbiz
have been going up every year.

00:02:28.795 --> 00:02:32.799
Capturing Kaga will make a big splash,
given his popularity with housewives.

00:02:32.882 --> 00:02:36.094
Go find evidence and information
we can use to bring in Kaga.

00:02:36.177 --> 00:02:37.345
Yes, sir!

00:02:38.012 --> 00:02:42.892
Isn't it likely that one of his victims
would be in a hospital for treatment?

00:02:42.976 --> 00:02:43.977
Good point.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.230
Aoshima, call every
single hospital in the city,

00:02:47.313 --> 00:02:50.358
and ask if anyone came in
for drug-related treatment recently.

00:02:50.441 --> 00:02:51.401
Yes, sir.

00:02:54.487 --> 00:02:56.698
I'll get going then, sir.

00:03:57.175 --> 00:03:58.217
Listen well.

00:03:58.301 --> 00:04:00.345
You'll pretend to be an S for the NCD,

00:04:00.428 --> 00:04:02.722
and leak their information
to the police as an S for us.

00:04:02.805 --> 00:04:05.600
- You mean like…
- A double agent.

00:04:06.184 --> 00:04:07.560
What's in it for me?

00:04:07.643 --> 00:04:11.064
I'll negate whatever dirt
Kurosaki has on you.

00:04:11.564 --> 00:04:16.527
Think long and hard
about who you ought to side with.

00:04:19.405 --> 00:04:21.783
The police or the NCD?

00:04:21.866 --> 00:04:25.119
Every one of you keeps demanding
whatever you want.

00:04:26.746 --> 00:04:29.707
I don't care if it's the police
or the NCD, I'll be your damn S!

00:04:31.542 --> 00:04:33.711
But just remember one thing.

00:04:36.923 --> 00:04:39.592
Don't think you can tame me that easily.

00:04:46.432 --> 00:04:47.517
Shit.

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:49.936
Mad bastard.

00:04:57.777 --> 00:04:59.821
And this guy too.

00:04:59.904 --> 00:05:01.906
Has he no shame?

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.880
Hey. Good job escaping the cops.

00:05:18.798 --> 00:05:20.466
Well, I got lucky.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:21.968
Good for you.

00:05:22.468 --> 00:05:24.512
You get to be free a while longer.

00:05:25.346 --> 00:05:26.681
Moving on.

00:05:26.764 --> 00:05:28.933
I've got another job for you.

00:05:30.476 --> 00:05:34.188
Kaga is being stalked by a woman
who he got hooked on drugs.

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:35.773
Snatch her.

00:05:36.357 --> 00:05:38.401
What? Why?

00:05:38.484 --> 00:05:42.029
Turns out that Kaga has connections
in the criminal world too.

00:05:42.113 --> 00:05:43.906
He must have begged some higher-ups.

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:51.164
This is the insane stalker woman.

00:05:55.209 --> 00:05:56.878
If you do a decent job,

00:05:57.378 --> 00:06:00.047
consider your debt cleared.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.884
Wait, for real?

00:06:08.222 --> 00:06:09.473
Here.

00:06:10.141 --> 00:06:12.518
- You're not joking, right?
- I'm not.

00:06:13.895 --> 00:06:16.981
You've been asking for more recently.

00:06:18.274 --> 00:06:21.611
I get flamed online all the time
because of out-of-context articles,

00:06:21.694 --> 00:06:25.781
and shitty ignorant amateurs try
to lecture me on what I'm doing wrong.

00:06:26.282 --> 00:06:28.492
I need a way to unwind, you know?

00:06:30.161 --> 00:06:32.705
Chiba's star sure is troubled.

00:06:39.003 --> 00:06:40.254
You trying to mock me?

00:06:42.465 --> 00:06:45.092
Come on, don't start
lashing out at me too.

00:06:49.388 --> 00:06:50.514
Sorry.

00:06:51.515 --> 00:06:55.102
To think she miscarried
even though you paid for the abortion.

00:06:55.853 --> 00:06:59.607
I would rather avoid any trouble,
so make sure you use condoms.

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.525
I know.

00:07:01.609 --> 00:07:07.031
To users of speed and coke like us,
that kind of trouble is the worst.

00:07:14.372 --> 00:07:16.290
The college student from before.

00:07:19.961 --> 00:07:22.880
Hello, what's up?

00:07:23.965 --> 00:07:25.550
Really?

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:28.386
You feeling okay?

00:07:30.555 --> 00:07:35.059
I can't remember
most of what happened that day.

00:07:35.685 --> 00:07:37.687
I didn't even drink that much.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.022
It's so weird.

00:07:40.106 --> 00:07:41.649
I see.

00:07:42.149 --> 00:07:44.277
How about we get dinner tonight?

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.695
What?

00:07:45.778 --> 00:07:49.782
There's a really good hot pot spot
I went to for a shoot recently.

00:07:49.865 --> 00:07:53.494
I'm sure you'll feel better
if you eat the hot pot there.

00:07:55.413 --> 00:07:56.622
Okay.

00:07:56.706 --> 00:07:58.958
Call you later, then.

00:08:01.627 --> 00:08:04.630
Another case of addiction,
like it always goes?

00:08:20.021 --> 00:08:23.691
Why are you drinking coffee
using a cup from someone else's home?

00:08:24.317 --> 00:08:25.359
It's hot water.

00:08:25.443 --> 00:08:26.819
Who cares?

00:08:28.988 --> 00:08:31.324
How did you get the police to release you?

00:08:32.533 --> 00:08:35.036
I threw the drugs down a drain as I ran.

00:08:35.536 --> 00:08:36.621
And then?

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:41.542
I said I panicked and ran
after they said they were police.

00:08:42.043 --> 00:08:44.962
So they released you
due to insufficient evidence?

00:08:45.546 --> 00:08:48.507
I see the police are as sloppy as always.

00:08:49.133 --> 00:08:51.135
Whatever. I have a mission for you.

00:08:51.218 --> 00:08:52.762
What, again?

00:08:53.262 --> 00:08:56.807
I'm still tired from the interrogation.
I didn't even get any sleep.

00:08:56.891 --> 00:08:57.892
Don't care.

00:08:58.392 --> 00:09:01.145
Hey, have you ever heard
of the Labor Standards Act?

00:09:01.228 --> 00:09:02.938
A criminal preaching law?

00:09:03.022 --> 00:09:06.067
- Could you treat me any worse?
- I'll arrest you if you refuse.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:09.695
There you go with that again.
I'm done with this already.

00:09:10.196 --> 00:09:11.530
Ow!

00:09:11.614 --> 00:09:12.698
Ouch!

00:09:12.782 --> 00:09:14.241
Not this again.

00:09:14.325 --> 00:09:17.286
You will do as I tell you,
or you will get arrested.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:18.788
Don't make me repeat myself.

00:09:20.039 --> 00:09:21.666
I get it. I'll do it.

00:09:22.166 --> 00:09:23.250
That hurts.

00:09:24.377 --> 00:09:27.171
And? What do you want this time?

00:09:27.254 --> 00:09:29.173
Find the women Kaga is preying on.

00:09:29.757 --> 00:09:30.508
What?

00:09:31.717 --> 00:09:32.551
What's wrong?

00:09:32.635 --> 00:09:35.388
Well, just a while ago…

00:09:37.807 --> 00:09:39.475
Matsubara ordered me to kidnap this woman.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.022
Kaga got her addicted,
and now, she's stalking him.

00:09:45.106 --> 00:09:47.983
There are probably others
going after her too.

00:09:49.026 --> 00:09:51.862
- What do they want with her?
- How would I know?

00:09:51.946 --> 00:09:53.489
I was only given orders.

00:09:55.449 --> 00:09:57.743
Stick to Kaga and get dirt on him.

00:09:57.827 --> 00:10:00.454
He's filming at a shopping district
in Chiba today.

00:10:00.538 --> 00:10:02.581
Really? Chiba?

00:10:02.665 --> 00:10:04.583
{\an8}That's so far.
I would have to go by train.

00:10:04.667 --> 00:10:06.127
{\an8}HIBIKI KAGA SCHEDULE

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:07.503
At least take me by car.

00:10:08.546 --> 00:10:10.965
I'll go by myself. Wish me luck, sir!

00:10:13.426 --> 00:10:14.677
On my way.

00:10:17.638 --> 00:10:21.434
Fate is chosen by time,
realized by the heart,

00:10:21.517 --> 00:10:24.645
and born when two souls
are attracted to each other.

00:10:25.312 --> 00:10:26.731
I'm Hibiki Kaga.

00:10:27.231 --> 00:10:31.360
I smelled the fragrance of romance
from the flowers of this street corner.

00:10:31.444 --> 00:10:32.611
Catch, catch!

00:10:33.904 --> 00:10:35.030
Let's go.

00:10:36.824 --> 00:10:40.453
Wait a second, take a look at this.

00:10:41.203 --> 00:10:45.666
The aura of these flowers is overpowering!

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:49.003
This shop is even more flowery than me!

00:10:49.503 --> 00:10:51.964
Let's take a closer look, shall we?

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.473
I'm so sleepy, damn it.

00:11:02.057 --> 00:11:04.769
Do you get watered every day?

00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:06.771
"Yes, I do."

00:11:06.854 --> 00:11:08.939
Man, that sounds nice.

00:11:09.023 --> 00:11:13.110
I wish someone would water me every day.

00:11:13.194 --> 00:11:14.236
Catch!

00:11:15.905 --> 00:11:17.406
- Good work today.
- Thanks.

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:18.991
We're done for the day.

00:11:19.074 --> 00:11:21.035
- Already?
- Yes. Thank you.

00:11:21.118 --> 00:11:23.037
Oh, wow. Nice work today.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.413
That's a surprise.

00:11:24.497 --> 00:11:28.792
Can you really use that shot of me pulling
love fortune slips alone at the shrine?

00:11:28.876 --> 00:11:30.961
I must have looked like a loser there.

00:11:31.045 --> 00:11:35.508
I think that will work great.
Should be relatable for lonely viewers.

00:11:35.591 --> 00:11:37.176
You serious?

00:11:37.259 --> 00:11:38.844
Hello?

00:11:38.928 --> 00:11:40.971
The shoot is over. Can I go home now?

00:11:41.055 --> 00:11:42.890
He's likely to take action now.

00:11:42.973 --> 00:11:45.643
Keep tailing him
until you get something on him.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.063
Will you at least pay for transportation?

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:53.692
What the hell is his problem?

00:12:00.491 --> 00:12:01.867
Eating out alone?

00:12:02.785 --> 00:12:04.453
I doubt that.

00:12:07.748 --> 00:12:09.542
Oh, there you are.

00:12:14.046 --> 00:12:15.381
Um…

00:12:16.924 --> 00:12:20.886
What happened after we ate the sushi?

00:12:21.929 --> 00:12:24.098
Wait, that's not her.

00:12:24.181 --> 00:12:27.643
I was alone in the hotel room
with no memory of how I got there.

00:12:29.436 --> 00:12:32.731
You said you felt unwell,
so I took you to a hotel.

00:12:32.815 --> 00:12:33.983
You don't remember that?

00:12:36.068 --> 00:12:38.779
The hot pot here is great.

00:12:38.862 --> 00:12:41.073
It will make you feel better for sure.

00:12:41.156 --> 00:12:42.783
Let's go in.

00:13:00.718 --> 00:13:04.805
Can I go home already?
This work environment is too toxic.

00:13:04.888 --> 00:13:06.724
My head hurts too.

00:13:06.807 --> 00:13:08.642
And? Where's Kaga?

00:13:10.519 --> 00:13:13.272
Still inside with a woman
who's not the target.

00:13:14.481 --> 00:13:16.400
Oh, that's her.

00:13:20.613 --> 00:13:22.448
- You go watch Kaga.
- What?

00:13:22.531 --> 00:13:24.366
Hey! The heck?

00:13:52.061 --> 00:13:52.895
Yes?

00:13:52.978 --> 00:13:54.730
You were right.

00:13:54.813 --> 00:13:57.316
At Minato Sakura General Hospital,

00:13:57.399 --> 00:14:01.320
a woman with symptoms of drug addiction
was brought in this morning.

00:14:01.403 --> 00:14:03.906
The symptoms point to a cocaine addiction.

00:14:03.989 --> 00:14:06.408
Understood. I'll head there right away.

00:14:06.492 --> 00:14:08.786
Be quick. Time is of the essence.

00:14:19.046 --> 00:14:20.464
- Where's Kaga?
- Still inside.

00:14:20.547 --> 00:14:22.007
- Get in.
- What?

00:14:26.261 --> 00:14:27.680
You in a hurry?

00:14:27.763 --> 00:14:29.974
We found a woman Kaga got hooked on drugs.

00:14:30.057 --> 00:14:30.891
What?

00:14:30.975 --> 00:14:33.060
We'll get to her before the police.

00:14:33.143 --> 00:14:33.978
Okay.

00:14:52.454 --> 00:14:53.706
It's this room.

00:14:59.086 --> 00:15:00.421
No way.

00:15:00.504 --> 00:15:02.464
I'll get a doctor.

00:15:08.595 --> 00:15:09.638
Why?

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:26.739
Why…

00:15:31.952 --> 00:15:33.954
Why!

00:15:37.875 --> 00:15:39.710
Damn it!

00:15:39.793 --> 00:15:40.919
Why?

00:15:41.003 --> 00:15:42.963
Why the hell?

00:15:43.047 --> 00:15:44.381
Shit.

00:15:45.591 --> 00:15:49.219
What the heck? Why are you crying?

00:15:50.012 --> 00:15:53.098
Isn't she just a stranger?

00:15:53.599 --> 00:15:56.310
It's just a drug addict who died.

00:16:00.981 --> 00:16:02.649
Ouch!

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:04.902
What's your problem?

00:16:08.947 --> 00:16:11.200
Try saying that again.

00:16:11.283 --> 00:16:12.659
What?

00:16:12.743 --> 00:16:14.036
I'll kill you.

00:16:14.119 --> 00:16:15.704
What are you getting worked up for?

00:16:17.706 --> 00:16:18.540
Get lost!

00:16:18.624 --> 00:16:20.459
What's up with you?

00:16:20.542 --> 00:16:23.462
Always so self-centered.
You're the one who brought me--

00:16:23.545 --> 00:16:24.588
Shut up!

00:16:24.671 --> 00:16:25.923
What is it with you?!

00:16:27.091 --> 00:16:28.717
Have it your way!

00:16:52.991 --> 00:16:54.993
You're at fault too, you know.

00:16:56.245 --> 00:16:57.246
What?

00:17:16.765 --> 00:17:17.933
Remember it now?

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:20.561
What?

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.729
Why?

00:17:23.397 --> 00:17:27.067
It would suck if this got
posted online, wouldn't it?

00:17:31.488 --> 00:17:35.159
We used some drugs
and had a lot of fun together.

00:17:35.242 --> 00:17:36.785
We're partners in crime.

00:17:37.703 --> 00:17:40.873
Now, let's eat while it's still soft.

00:18:02.853 --> 00:18:07.524
Damn, my head hurts, and so does my face.

00:18:08.025 --> 00:18:10.277
I can't sleep even though I'm sleepy.

00:18:11.028 --> 00:18:14.781
How dare he punch me
after making me do all that work?

00:18:15.407 --> 00:18:17.159
Goddamn narcotics agent!

00:18:17.659 --> 00:18:19.119
I'm gonna sleep again!

00:18:21.205 --> 00:18:24.374
The woman took her life at the hospital.

00:18:24.458 --> 00:18:25.459
What?

00:18:26.043 --> 00:18:28.670
According to Kurosaki, who discovered her,

00:18:28.754 --> 00:18:32.799
she's undoubtedly someone
who got hooked on drugs due to Kaga.

00:18:33.717 --> 00:18:35.594
What an absolute scumbag.

00:18:36.303 --> 00:18:37.971
Filthy beast.

00:18:38.764 --> 00:18:39.848
Let's arrest him.

00:18:39.932 --> 00:18:41.683
We can get his urine with a warrant.

00:18:41.767 --> 00:18:44.311
As I'm sure you all already know,

00:18:44.811 --> 00:18:48.232
even if an autopsy reveals
traces of drugs in her system,

00:18:48.315 --> 00:18:50.067
we don't know her relation to Kaga.

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:53.070
Are you saying we can't do anything?

00:18:53.153 --> 00:18:54.238
Yes.

00:18:54.321 --> 00:18:57.574
We can't get a search warrant,
let alone an arrest warrant.

00:18:58.075 --> 00:18:59.159
Shit.

00:18:59.868 --> 00:19:02.996
But we can't just let him
get away with this.

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.832
Are we going to let
scum like him roam free?

00:19:05.916 --> 00:19:10.254
I'm with you. We have to keep
gathering evidence in secret for now.

00:19:10.754 --> 00:19:13.298
I ordered Kurosaki to do so as well.

00:19:13.382 --> 00:19:15.050
Where the heck is he?

00:19:20.389 --> 00:19:21.723
Hot!

00:19:22.307 --> 00:19:23.392
It's hot water.

00:19:23.475 --> 00:19:24.601
Don't give me that!

00:19:24.685 --> 00:19:26.645
Wait, this is illegal trespassing!

00:19:27.312 --> 00:19:31.066
Shut up. Don't hide behind the law
when you broke it, criminal scum.

00:19:31.984 --> 00:19:33.944
I can't handle this today.

00:19:34.027 --> 00:19:36.655
My head hurts
from getting too little sleep.

00:19:36.738 --> 00:19:38.699
And that punch from you still hurts.

00:19:38.782 --> 00:19:40.325
Let me get some sleep.

00:19:40.409 --> 00:19:42.953
Look. My eyelids are so heavy.

00:19:43.036 --> 00:19:44.454
Good night.

00:19:54.089 --> 00:19:55.090
What are these?

00:19:55.173 --> 00:19:57.301
Loxoprofen Sodium.

00:19:57.384 --> 00:19:58.635
That's some new drug?

00:19:58.719 --> 00:20:01.930
It's a painkiller.
Should take care of most kinds of pain.

00:20:02.014 --> 00:20:03.140
You sure about that?

00:20:03.223 --> 00:20:06.560
You don't get to question
the effects of medicine, scum.

00:20:06.643 --> 00:20:08.061
Chill, man.

00:20:08.145 --> 00:20:09.813
I have a new mission for you.

00:20:09.896 --> 00:20:12.774
Did you hear the part
about me not getting any sleep?

00:20:12.858 --> 00:20:15.360
- Didn't you sleep yesterday?
- I couldn't!

00:20:15.444 --> 00:20:17.904
My head hurts like it's being
smacked by a hammer.

00:20:17.988 --> 00:20:20.699
Don't care! Your own fault
if you can't sleep at home.

00:20:20.782 --> 00:20:22.242
- You what?
- Just get dressed.

00:20:24.578 --> 00:20:25.829
All right already.

00:20:26.747 --> 00:20:29.624
Oh, one thing though.

00:20:29.708 --> 00:20:32.711
The woman from yesterday
had nothing to do with you, right?

00:20:33.211 --> 00:20:35.255
So why do you care so much?

00:20:35.339 --> 00:20:36.631
Not your business.

00:20:37.591 --> 00:20:41.470
Didn't expect
you would have that side to you.

00:20:43.055 --> 00:20:44.806
Ouch!

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:47.059
Shut up. Stop talking.

00:20:47.142 --> 00:20:48.393
I'll take down Kaga.

00:20:48.477 --> 00:20:51.271
That's why I'm letting you roam free.

00:20:51.355 --> 00:20:53.398
You just do as I tell you to.

00:20:54.107 --> 00:20:55.442
Get off me!

00:20:55.942 --> 00:20:57.152
That hurts.

00:20:58.362 --> 00:21:00.197
What do I have to do?

00:21:01.031 --> 00:21:03.742
We can't act in the open without evidence.

00:21:03.825 --> 00:21:06.912
My team is probably trying
to covertly gather evidence.

00:21:06.995 --> 00:21:09.373
But we're against time
when it comes to drugs!

00:21:09.456 --> 00:21:13.126
Another person could fall victim
while we stick to above-board methods.

00:21:14.961 --> 00:21:17.839
Remember the woman
at the hot pot place yesterday?

00:21:18.715 --> 00:21:19.549
Yeah.

00:21:19.633 --> 00:21:21.676
Kaga could be feeding her cocaine,

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.012
or potentially using her as a pawn.

00:21:24.638 --> 00:21:25.889
Tail her.

00:21:26.765 --> 00:21:28.058
About that,

00:21:28.725 --> 00:21:31.603
I have a bruise on my face
from you punching me.

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:34.898
Don't you think I might draw attention?

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.402
I will, won't I?
It's going to affect the mission!

00:21:38.485 --> 00:21:41.571
I think it's a bad idea!
Don't you think it's a bad idea?

00:21:42.906 --> 00:21:44.533
I bought makeup products.

00:21:45.033 --> 00:21:45.909
What?

00:21:46.451 --> 00:21:48.954
You were an actor, right?
Hide it with makeup.

00:21:50.247 --> 00:21:52.207
You bought way too much.

00:21:56.169 --> 00:21:59.714
You said to tail her,
but where even is she?

00:22:21.653 --> 00:22:22.612
A GPS tracker?

00:22:23.238 --> 00:22:24.948
She's at her home right now.

00:22:25.031 --> 00:22:27.200
- Isn't this a crime?
- So what?

00:22:27.284 --> 00:22:29.244
I have my own methods.

00:22:30.287 --> 00:22:32.539
{\an8}You really are mad.

00:22:33.039 --> 00:22:37.502
{\an8}She's a college student named
Aoi Sugihara, from what I could find.

00:22:38.003 --> 00:22:39.588
{\an8}If we keep track of her,

00:22:39.671 --> 00:22:42.591
{\an8}we'll uncover Kaga's
true colors soon enough.

00:22:44.384 --> 00:22:45.594
{\an8}Hey!

00:22:48.722 --> 00:22:50.265
{\an8}What's his problem?

00:22:52.684 --> 00:22:55.020
{\an8}Screw that! I'm not taking this!

00:22:55.103 --> 00:22:58.023
{\an8}I won't let him get his way.

00:23:00.859 --> 00:23:02.569
{\an8}Hello, Umezawa here.

00:23:03.612 --> 00:23:06.573
{\an8}I met with that shitty Kurosaki
from the NCD just now.

00:23:07.073 --> 00:23:08.450
{\an8}I have some info.

00:23:09.117 --> 00:23:10.035
{\an8}Do you want it?

00:23:12.412 --> 00:23:14.581
{\an8}I didn't expect a call
from you this quick.

00:23:15.832 --> 00:23:18.043
{\an8}Quite useful, aren't you?

00:23:25.592 --> 00:23:28.386
{\an8}Kaga told her to come
to a club in Roppongi tonight.

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:29.471
{\an8}Sneak in.

00:23:29.554 --> 00:23:30.430
{\an8}What?

00:23:30.513 --> 00:23:33.934
{\an8}You think they'll just let me
into such a crazy party that easily?

00:23:34.017 --> 00:23:36.269
I didn't say to go in as a guest.

00:23:36.853 --> 00:23:40.023
{\an8}As long as the rule
of law exists in Japan,

00:23:40.106 --> 00:23:42.692
{\an8}we have to prioritize
optics above all else!

00:23:42.776 --> 00:23:45.362
{\an8}Screw that! You're just trying
to cover your own ass!

00:23:45.445 --> 00:23:48.073
{\an8}- You really a dealer?
- If you get high…

00:23:48.156 --> 00:23:49.324
{\an8}KAGA CORNERS HIM

00:23:49.908 --> 00:23:52.452
{\an8}I'll buy enough for everyone here.

00:23:52.535 --> 00:23:54.329
{\an8}Goddamn it!
