WEBVTT

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.220
Compared to her contributions,

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.810
what we've done

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.900
is nothing.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.340
It's pointless

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.850
to say those compliments here.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.650
Go say them in Beijing if you can.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.850
Why aren't you eating?

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.120
Is it not good?

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.740
It's good. It's delicious.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.740
Just looking at it makes me hungry.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.930
What's wrong?

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:52.520
Can't sleep?

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.000
Did I wake you?

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.280
No.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.800
I haven't gone to bed yet.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.210
I just...

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.080
dreamed of Dolma.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.710
She must be cheering you on.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.500
She asked me

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.170
if we had given up on mining there

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.870
and if I was going to let

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.000
the information she died for be buried

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.120
in Bolamula forever.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.360
I couldn't answer her.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.630
You can show her

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.220
the report we've made

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.740
and tell her about what we've experienced.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.190
When dealing with others,

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.210
I have countless reasons

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:45.210
to convince them.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.590
But when facing Dolma,

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.340
I even doubt

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.680
whether what I've insisted on for so long

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.690
is right

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:57.970
or wrong.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.630
I don't know Dolma,

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:07.960
so I can't speak for her.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.080
But

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.480
would the Bolamula of her dreams

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.269
be a place full of gullies

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.230
where all living beings have been devastated?

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.300
Whether it's Dolma,

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.620
Lin,

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.080
or other colleagues in the County Party Committee,

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:37.310
everyone's love

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.540
for this land

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.860
is no less than mine.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.690
But why

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.570
are our understandings

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:48.770
so different?

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.370
Sometimes I'm afraid...

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.510
afraid that I'm the one who's wrong.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.560
If...

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.740
we can't even protect

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.810
the living creatures in this place,

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.870
how can we claim to love it?

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.070
The old me

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.420
might

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.390
have doubted

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:28.830
and wavered.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.750
But now,

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.560
I have only one answer.

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:39.190
I'm

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.450
proud of

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.560
what we are doing.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.159
I'm proud of you.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.270
Thank you.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.740
You're acting

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.540
more and more like a captain now.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.390
Duo, are you alright?

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.740
Han said

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.270
the same thing to me today.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:09.920
But he only said

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.500
I'm like a deputy captain.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:14.420
Besides,

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.430
in the team,

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:16.370
I'm not

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.010
the strongest physically,

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.070
nor do I have the ability

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.010
to make everyone's lives

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.860
better.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.420
I'm just

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.330
an ordinary

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:27.690
police officer.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:31.180
You never needed

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.250
to be like a scout

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.690
in the Mountain Patrol.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.470
Out there in the Uninhabited Zone,

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.510
you embody the law for us.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:41.510
If you hadn't stopped

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:42.870
He back then,

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:45.360
we might have done

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.330
the same things as the poachers.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.020
We all have to thank you for that.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:09.500
Look.

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:11.250
A little medal.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:14.300
I have one too.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.190
You've been in the Mountain Patrol

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:32.500
for over a year, right?

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:36.659
It's been a year and ten months.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:41.950
Sometimes I feel like

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.550
the days in the mountains...

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.710
are longer than a lifetime.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:50.930
Yeah.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.020
When I'm in the mountains,

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.180
I just want to come back soon.

00:07:58.130 --> 00:07:59.560
But after a few days back,

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.190
I'm already thinking about

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.130
going into the mountains again.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:23.180
Want it?

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:25.280
No, thanks.

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:36.750
Let's go up and have a look.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.100
A meeting of the Standing Committee.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.360
It's not appropriate.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:48.220
The topic of today's meeting

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:49.320
is to decide

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:50.740
whether to submit Mr. Lin Peisheng's

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.360
development zone application report

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.580
or Mr. Duojie's

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:54.770
reserve application report

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:55.740
to the city.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:57.620
I hope you all

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.500
can approach this objectively,

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.240
without

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.460
emotional bias.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:03.910
County Mayor Lin.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:08.700
Mr. Duojie's report

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:10.220
provides significant guidance

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:11.980
for the development zone planning.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.510
Incorporating his report,

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:14.750
I've made some adjustments

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.250
to my development zone plan

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:17.910
and formed two new proposals.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.100
Now,

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.720
I'd like to discuss them with you.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.090
The first proposal:

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:26.980
we'll start by

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:28.720
bringing in high-quality industrial and mining enterprises,

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.910
focusing on development

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:31.240
for three to five years.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.130
To fully boost the economy.

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:34.150
Let's remove our county's

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:34.890
"impoverished county" label

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:35.740
first.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.080
Once the county's finances have strengthened

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.010
and people's lives have improved,

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:41.480
we will then submit

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.150
the application report

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.200
for establishing a nature reserve to the higher authorities.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.580
I mentioned in my report

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.390
that the Tibetan antelope population

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:49.080
has already reached

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.480
the brink of extinction.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.270
In another three to five years,

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:53.340
they might

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.270
disappear from the planet

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:55.220
forever.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.000
Those are all estimates you made

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.260
based on the situation

00:09:58.290 --> 00:09:59.130
in the past.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.090
Things are different now.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.340
The largest

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.720
illegal mining and poaching gang

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.460
in Bolamula

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:05.960
has been taken down.

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:07.170
Also,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:08.840
the County Forestry Police

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:09.960
will be established soon,

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.170
so the problem of insufficient police force

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:12.170
will be resolved.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:12.980
Plus,

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:14.150
with our administration

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:15.010
of the development zone...

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:15.910
What makes you think

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:16.670
that Li Yongqiang's gang

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:17.910
is the biggest gang?

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.150
I've been in there for over two years.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:22.240
and I still wouldn't dare make that judgment.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.150
Do you know

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:24.860
how many routes there are into Bolamula?

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.240
How many checkpoints

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.170
can a county forestry police force set up?

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:27.910
Mr. Duojie!

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:30.200
Mr. Lin Peisheng.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.220
As I have said before,

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.080
let us discuss this rationally

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.410
and set emotions aside.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:36.370
Okay.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.240
Let me present the second proposal.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:40.750
We will submit

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.430
the application report for establishing

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:45.000
a nature reserve to our superiors

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:45.600
right now.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.240
However,

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.830
the reserve's scope

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.660
must be significantly reduced.

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:51.100
Bolamula covers

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.460
more than 40,000 square kilometers.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:53.250
A one-size-fits-all approach

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:54.770
would be irresponsible.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:56.200
Based on

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:57.770
the development zone application report's data

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.230
regarding mineral types,

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:00.630
distribution of mineral veins,

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:01.890
and mineral reserves,

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:02.910
combined with

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.720
the reserve application report's information

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.460
on Tibetan antelope migration routes,

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.590
climate, and hydrological features,

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:10.350
I've devised a compromise.

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:11.130
That is,

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.340
to limit the reserve's area

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:13.940
to

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:16.210
within 20,000 square kilometers.

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:19.360
Of course.

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:22.110
If we adopt this proposal,

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.130
economic development will proceed

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:25.660
more slowly than expected.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:27.510
But considering

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:28.750
the unique ecological importance

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:30.510
of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:31.940
to the entire country,

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:33.150
slowing down a bit

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.370
is worth it, in my opinion.

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:37.270
This is worth considering.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:38.940
I agree with this too.

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:39.820
I agree too.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:41.050
This is

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:43.750
a good solution that balances both interests.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.100
Deputy County Mayor Duo,

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.240
what do you think?

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.180
Wishful thinking.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.770
All armchair strategy.

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:57.890
Mr. Duojie!

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:02.890
Secretary Chen,

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:04.150
County Mayor Lin.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:07.770
What I'm about to say

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:09.170
is not driven by emotion.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:11.100
During this time,

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.230
I've been thinking—

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:15.100
can development and conservation

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:17.100
truly coexist

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:17.940
in Bolamula?

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:20.440
Like

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:21.750
all of you here,

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:23.170
I hope

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:23.910
we can find

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:26.340
a solution that balances both interests.

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:28.540
But I can't deceive myself.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.890
County Mayor Lin, you keep emphasizing

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:33.620
scientific,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:34.730
meticulous,

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.020
and moderate mining.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:37.840
Given our current human resources

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.410
and management capabilities,

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:40.100
what makes you think

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.230
we can achieve that?

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.700
And what makes you believe

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:44.080
the large industrial and mining enterprises

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.010
you're bringing in

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:46.150
will comply?

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:47.500
This is precisely the challenge

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:47.980
that tests

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.580
our capabilities as managers.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:50.390
The Party and the people

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:51.450
have placed us here

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:52.030
precisely to

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:54.030
shoulder these responsibilities.

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:55.200
Solving these problems

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.360
is our duty.

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:02.400
Bolamula

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:03.590
is a treasure trove.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.390
Once its doors

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.510
are opened,

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:07.710
it will test

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:08.500
not only

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:09.840
us as administrators

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:11.820
but also

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:13.710
the darkest, most greedy nature

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:15.050
of every person

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:16.890
who enters it.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:24.260
A single Tibetan antelope pelt

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:25.630
can sell for 600 yuan

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:26.910
to a street trader

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:29.030
on National Highway 109.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:31.770
When smuggled to South Asia,

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.770
the price skyrockets to 3,000 yuan!

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.220
Yet, made into a Shahtoosh shawl,

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.290
one can sell for

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.410
up to 40,000 US dollars

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:39.340
in European and American markets!

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:39.750
But

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.320
the cost to obtain a pelt

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:43.720
is only seven to ten yuan.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.880
According to Marxist theory,

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:49.410
when a business's profit

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:50.700
reaches 300 percent,

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:52.910
capital will dare to commit any crime,

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:53.910
trample all laws,

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:54.550
and even risk

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:55.720
being hanged!

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.040
And the profit from poaching

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.740
is far more than 300 percent.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:09.600
I sincerely urge you, comrades,

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.130
to consider this carefully

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.010
and not become the sinners

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:15.450
who open this treasure trove.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.870
Discussions about human nature...

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:43.410
are endless.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:46.170
The debate over

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:47.500
whether human nature is

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:49.320
Mencius, axe.

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:51.030
has persisted since the time of Mencius and Xunzi,

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:52.890
yet there's still no conclusion.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:53.860
As for the direction

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.460
Mazhi County should take...

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:57.720
I suggest

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.620
we decide by democratic vote.

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:05.870
Alright.

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:11.400
All in favor of submitting

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.320
the development zone application report to the city,

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.720
please raise your hands.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.870
Four votes.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:25.390
All in favor of submitting

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.650
the nature reserve application report,

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.220
please raise your hands.

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.340
Mr. Duojie,

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:45.580
what is your decision?

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:54.290
I abstain.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:57.770
What do you mean?

00:15:58.580 --> 00:15:59.200
Wasn't the reserve

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.580
your proposal?

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:06.170
I believe...

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:08.340
we should not

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:09.670
make this decision now.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.050
Once this step is taken,

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:17.600
recovering from it

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:19.870
would take at least

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:21.050
hundreds of years.

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:24.080
That cost

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:26.220
is not something

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.130
the few of us here

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:28.120
can bear.

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:32.550
On this trip to Beijing,

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.620
besides giving lectures at universities,

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:36.460
I'll meet with

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:38.910
leaders and experts from the Ministry of Forestry.

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:40.080
I'll ask them for feedback

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:40.890
on my report.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:44.860
I'll also bring

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.190
the development zone application report

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:49.580
to environmental

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:51.270
and geological experts

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.740
and have them do an assessment together.

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:57.620
County Mayor Lin

00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.840
has been proposing to build a development zone

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:00.840
for three years.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.420
We've waited three years.

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:07.510
We can also wait

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:09.700
another month or two.

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:20.589
Party Secretary.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:21.599
Director.

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:23.640
Uncle Lin.

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:24.329
No...

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:25.329
County Mayor Lin.

00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:26.609
County Mayor Lin.

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:32.610
Looks like the results are good.

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:36.000
How was it?

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:38.370
You're a Party member.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:39.510
Don't pry.

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:45.330
Duojie.

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:49.540
Have a safe trip.

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:51.150
Come back soon.

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:52.750
Okay.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:53.770
Goodbye.

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.230
Goodbye, County Mayor Lin.

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:09.150
Deputy County Mayor Duo, hello.

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:27.220
Hey.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.340
This knife is exquisite.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.440
Did you just buy it?

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:32.650
It's still Dolma's.

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:34.330
Tashi had someone make

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:36.460
a new sheath with a leather strap for it

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.200
and insisted on giving it to me.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.010
It's not appropriate

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:40.240
to take it on the plane.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.700
I'll leave it here for now.

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:43.790
This is nice.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.360
You should've given me something like this.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.310
What do the words carved on it

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:48.090
mean?

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.600
"As steadfast as a snow-capped mountain."

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:03.670
Let's go?

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:04.880
Go.

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:28.330
Maybe

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:29.840
some of you here

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:31.110
have heard of me before

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:33.110
and have some idea of who I am.

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:35.520
I'm very nervous

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:38.310
because I might not be

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:39.330
who

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:41.570
you expected.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:44.810
Actually,

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:47.550
my Mountain Patrol members and I

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:49.210
are ordinary people.

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:51.220
We are not

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:52.640
some legendary heroes,

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:55.850
nor are we immortal gods

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:57.880
who can't be killed.

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:02.400
Otherwise, I wouldn't be the only one...

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:05.920
sitting here today.

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:08.910
-Pull it over there.
-Okay.

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:11.880
Our deputy captain,

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.730
Comrade He Qingyuan...

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.400
Okay. Pull it tighter.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.050
Just sacrificed his life

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:17.030
in a battle

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:19.200
not long ago.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:22.790
The reason we've been able to

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:24.050
keep going until today

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.880
is that we can endure more hardship.

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:30.250
We love

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:31.210
this land more.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.420
Seeing the corpses of Tibetan antelopes

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:37.290
scattered throughout

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:38.550
the Uninhabited Zone,

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.440
we were just doing

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.640
what ordinary people

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.460
should do.

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:04.940
Let's go.

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:05.740
Okay.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:07.480
Sangba!

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:09.020
We should go!

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:10.770
Alright! Almost done!

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:28.510
County Mayor Lin!

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:29.790
What's the rush?

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:30.510
Secretary Chen has called

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:31.570
an emergency meeting

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:33.180
and asked you to come over right away.

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:34.240
A baby Tibetan antelope

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.310
can run faster

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.710
three days after it's born!

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:40.200
But it still can't outrun

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.140
the poachers' jeeps

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:42.970
and bullets.

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:45.630
In just a few years,

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.850
the Tibetan antelope population has been hunted down

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:50.450
from 200,000 to only 30,000.

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:56.780
These photos...

00:22:58.680 --> 00:22:59.540
and this one...

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:01.830
are all evidence

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.220
we took at the scene...

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:06.430
of the poachers shooting

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:07.790
and killing antelopes.

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.500
But Mazhi County is

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.100
a poverty-stricken county.

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.240
It's hard to get paid.

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:15.200
let alone provide much funding

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:15.980
for us to protect

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:16.790
wild animals.

00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:19.510
It's already remarkable that the county

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:20.550
could support us

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.770
in establishing the Mountain Patrol.

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:25.610
Many times,

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.680
my team members and I

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:28.550
ate

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:31.460
frozen tsampa and dried meat

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:33.440
and drank snow water

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:35.960
while chasing poachers out there.

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:38.460
The Municipal Discipline Inspection Commission

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:39.550
just forwarded a letter

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:40.480
from the public.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.160
Everyone, take a look.

00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:15.250
Chief.

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:17.750
Turn off the engine. All of you, get out of the car.

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:18.240
Chief,

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:19.780
what happened?

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:21.090
People might consider

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:22.900
some of my methods

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:23.880
radical.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.220
Well, I can't help it.

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:29.660
We had no other choice!

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:31.310
We could only do it!

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.710
If we keep working like this

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:37.240
and can make even a small contribution

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.370
to humanity and society in the future,

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:40.770
I think it's worth it!

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:02.270
Members of the Mountain Patrol

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:03.220
are suspected of

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:05.110
trafficking wildlife products

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.070
and illegally trading firearms and ammunition.

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:09.530
All of you, come back to the station

00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:10.930
with me for questioning.

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:14.310
Chief.

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:16.480
That's impossible.

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:18.000
How could we possibly

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000
do such things?

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:21.320
Follow orders.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:22.700
Take them all away!

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:23.160
Move.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:23.850
Move.

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:25.310
We are Forestry Police!

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:26.880
Police arresting police?

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.010
Move! Get in the car!

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:28.440
Get in!

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:30.490
Move!

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.350
Chief!

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000
County Mayor Duo.

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:38.140
I just received payment for my article.

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:39.220
I'd like to ask you, County Mayor Duo,

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:40.200
to accept it.

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:42.840
I don't know if it's enough.

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:43.700
First,

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.270
please buy a khata

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:47.630
and offer it to our fallen comrade.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.030
With the rest,

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.280
buy whatever supplies you need.

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:55.110
Thank you.

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:05.490
Your gun.

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:32.110
Take her away.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:37.220
Mainly,

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:38.090
I think the outside world

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:38.680
doesn't understand us enough.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:39.410
Okay, got it.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:40.500
So I also hope that

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:41.240
if you ever have time,

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.110
you can come to my hometown

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.970
and take a look.

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:44.460
You can see, um...

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:45.180
Excuse me.

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:46.110
Excuse me, everyone.

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:47.140
I want to speak with Captain Duojie

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:48.000
for a moment.

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:49.310
Okay.

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:53.160
Something happened to the Mountain Patrol.

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:56.920
Last November,

00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:58.010
you sold

00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:58.940
120 Tibetan antelope pelts

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:00.070
on the black market.

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:01.420
Is that true?

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:02.700
Impossible!

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:04.830
To raise money,

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:05.960
Captain Duojie

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.760
even mortgaged his own pasture!

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:08.790
How could we possibly

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:09.700
sell pelts?

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:12.240
We did.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:15.790
That was the first time.

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:20.090
At that time, our deputy captain,

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:20.980
He Qingyuan...

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.480
was shot in the Uninhabited Zone

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:27.910
and desperately needed money for surgery.

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:29.270
There were also team members

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:31.730
waiting for rescue in the Uninhabited Zone.

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:33.420
We needed to buy supplies

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:34.620
and get in there fast.

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:36.570
We really had no money.

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.000
How many times did you sell pelts in total?

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:40.590
Three.

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:42.000
Who ordered it?

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:11.030
According to the report,

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:11.660
the money

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:13.280
from the third sale of pelts

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:13.750
was also used

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:15.510
to purchase firearms and ammunition.

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:16.420
Is that true?

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:19.440
Yes.

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:21.340
What were they used for?

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:22.510
At Mount Qimar,

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:24.240
the illegal gold miners

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.170
had lots of guns.

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:27.480
The guns and ammo the Public Security Bureau gave us

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.410
weren't enough.

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.030
We had to make some preparations.

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:32.830
Who arranged the deal this time?

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:35.720
Me.

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.010
Did you know about

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:37.810
all of this?

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:47.580
No, I didn't.

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:08.110
Why did you come?

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:11.510
Where is the Captain?

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:14.310
Was he arrested too?

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:21.310
Say something.

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:24.530
Tell me.

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.040
After you got in trouble,

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:28.030
he immediately rushed back

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:29.290
from Beijing.

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:33.700
But on the way back from the airport,

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:37.390
he disappeared.

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:44.550
He disappeared?

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:49.180
Some people in the county are saying...

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:52.250
he fled to escape punishment.

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:56.850
County Mayor Lin is busy right now.

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:57.510
Let me in!

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:58.310
Miss Bai,

00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.680
he is busy.

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.550
I'll just say a few words!

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:00.980
Miss Bai!

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:01.270
Let me in!

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:01.570
Miss Bai!

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:01.880
Let me in!

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:02.420
He is busy!

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:03.030
Miss Bai!

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:03.680
Miss Bai...

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:04.680
County Mayor Lin,

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.090
I want to talk to you!

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:08.460
Okay.

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:09.900
Zhang, you may leave us.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:18.960
County Mayor Lin,

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:20.350
why do you say

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:22.280
Duojie fled to escape punishment?

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:27.310
The case is still under investigation.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:28.240
We are looking for him too.

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.500
He couldn't have fled!

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.270
The gold mine has been sealed off,

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:33.070
and the Mountain Patrol has attracted

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:34.180
so much attention.

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:35.750
He was even planning

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:37.110
to establish a reserve.

00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:39.010
He just received so much support

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:40.400
in Beijing!

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:41.740
He couldn't have just

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:42.480
left the Mountain Patrol behind

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.330
like this!

00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:47.940
Then...

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:50.290
where is he right now?

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:57.050
The county has mobilized

00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:59.110
almost everyone these past few days,

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:00.400
contacting all of Duojie's relatives

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.250
and friends.

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.010
The County Public Security Bureau

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:06.070
is also conducting searches

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.810
along the road from the airport

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:07.610
to the county.

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:14.150
I've known him for so many years.

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:15.710
I know

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.050
no matter what happens,

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:19.350
Duojie is a man

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:20.810
who owns up to his actions.

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:22.900
He would never hide just because of

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.100
something like this.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.290
You don't want this,

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:28.960
and I want it even less for Duojie

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.490
to end up in this situation.

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:40.340
But you did sell Tibetan antelope pelts

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:41.830
and illegally

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:44.610
purchase guns.

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:46.420
Is that entirely our fault?

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:50.350
We only earn 200 yuan a month,

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.060
and we often go unpaid for months.

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:54.070
Usually, we just eat

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:56.670
plain noodle soup, with no meat or vegetables.

00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:58.700
When we face poachers in the mountains,

00:33:58.700 --> 00:33:59.180
they have

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:00.030
loads of guns

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:01.140
and ammunition!

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:03.070
Our team member was injured

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:04.330
and nearly lost a limb!

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:05.680
We barely scraped together

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:07.140
the money for the surgery!

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.920
In our most difficult times,

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:13.010
Duojie even had to

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:14.150
mortgage his own pasture

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:14.940
just to cover

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:15.960
our gas money!

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:17.280
The funding allocated to us

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.940
was taken away just like that!

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.650
The herdsmen's livestock matter,

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:20.880
but

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:22.570
we don't?

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:25.820
"Fleeing to escape punishment?"

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:29.070
Why would he flee?

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:32.500
What crime did he commit?

00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:46.000
Uncle Lin...

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:53.590
Please help us.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.840
Please help us.

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:09.280
I understand how you feel.

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:13.100
I'm just as anxious as you are.

00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:16.500
But right now,

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:17.830
we still can't find him.

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.860
And without him, a lot of things

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:21.720
just can't be explained clearly.

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:28.920
I hope...

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:33.800
I hope you can understand.

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:40.700
I can't understand.

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:43.400
After discussion and approval

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:44.550
by the Party branch meeting

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:46.670
of the Mazhi County Public Security Bureau

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:48.630
and with the consent of the Bureau Party Committee,

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:50.630
it was decided to give Comrade Bai Ju

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:52.480
a Party warning.

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:53.960
Comrade Bai Ju

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.090
must properly accept

00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:56.210
the organization's decision

00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:58.270
and reflect deeply on her own issues.

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:30.150
As a Communist Party member...

00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:33.630
one must still seek truth from facts.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.400
What about Duojie's report?

00:36:57.010 --> 00:36:58.140
My suggestion is...

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:03.710
to submit both application reports

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:04.510
together.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:07.670
I agree.

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.960
Well...

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:47.000
how will the newspaper office

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.260
deal with me this time?

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:55.560
Forget it.

00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:57.250
Whatever happens, happens.

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:00.800
Tell me...

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:03.980
If back then,

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:06.280
I'd really seen them

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:07.420
selling pelts,

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:11.400
do you think I would've stopped them?

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:18.360
If it were me...

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:22.810
I couldn't have.

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:33.840
I guess...

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:36.730
this time,

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:39.120
whether I get transferred or suspended,

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:41.530
it'll be over in a week or two

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:42.690
at most.

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:45.840
At worst, I'll just lose my job.

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:47.610
Doesn't matter anymore.

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:51.540
I'll come back as soon as I can.

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:53.510
You don't need to come back.

00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:58.150
There is no Mountain Patrol anymore.

00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:00.940
The Captain is missing.

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.760
This path

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:05.940
is cut off.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.500
You never belonged here.

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:15.030
You don't need to come back.

00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:16.510
Bai Ju, I don't care.

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:18.650
I don't care at all!

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:22.630
The Captain hasn't been found yet.

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:23.070
And...

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:26.480
And you're still here.

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:27.150
I definitely can't...

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:27.840
You can't help with

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.300
the Captain's situation.

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:33.480
As for me...

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:38.230
even I don't know

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:40.920
what my future looks like.

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.500
So what could you possibly do?

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:50.560
Stop talking nonsense.

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:53.810
Care about yourself for once.

00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:17.750
A favor returned for a favor—

00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:19.940
that's

00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:22.860
how bonds are formed.

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:27.800
Thank you.

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:32.340
You said

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:35.820
this book means

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.000
a lot to you.

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:41.050
So...

00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:44.530
it shouldn't belong here,

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:48.000
and certainly not to me.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.040
It's time to return it to you.

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:10.360
But there are some things

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:11.560
I won't return to you.

00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:15.800
I'll keep them in my heart.

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:21.510
For us...

00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:26.150
just keeping them in our hearts is enough.
