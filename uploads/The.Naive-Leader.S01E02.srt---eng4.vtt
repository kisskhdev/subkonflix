WEBVTT

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:39.980
I think you're swatting a fly on a tiger's head

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:41.339
You must be tired of living

00:01:41.339 --> 00:01:43.260
I don't have time to waste with you

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:44.820
Scram

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:54.219
Misunderstanding, it's a misunderstanding

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.180
We're just passing through, looking for someone

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.980
Went the wrong way

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:58.779
Kneel down

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:00.020
Kneeling is a bit much

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:01.380
Squat down

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.939
What's up? What's up?

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.339
What's the matter?

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.540
I'll handle it

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.380
He has a gun in his hand

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.660
I saw it, it's a gun

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:17.820
Can't win against that

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.100
This whole thing...

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.540
...was never our business anyway

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.060
Open the umbrella, every man for himself

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.940
How could we possibly leave you here?

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.660
I'll go find two kitchen knives first

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.060
I'll go find a hoe

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.060
If you have treasure, offer it

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.340
If no treasure, undergo the test

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.820
Together we support the Han House

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:53.459
Creating fortune and prosperity

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.139
Here are my card and credentials

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:56.100
Please receive them

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:57.940
Gold plates, silver plates

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.179
Brother offers treasure to brother

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.179
If you accept this treasure, brother

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.220
May you rise to sit in the eight-bearer sedan

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.459
Which Dragon Wharf? Which chair do you sit in?

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.060
My surname is Fan

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.340
My given name is Pengju

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.980
Weiyuan Yizi Hall, holding the Yao rank

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:13.699
The flood has washed over the Dragon King's temple

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.340
So, brother, you are also in the life

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.179
My apologies, my apologies

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:20.739
The person is sick like this

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.859
Why beat a lame rabbit?

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:24.820
Brother

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.100
You want to raise the Banner of Brotherhood here

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:28.619
If you want to raise the Banner of Brotherhood

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:29.859
Then don't flake out

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.220
How much does she owe you?

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.060
She borrowed five silver dollars from our master

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:36.419
Now with interest rolling over

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:37.579
It's ten silver dollars

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.859
Chengdu to Huayang, cash on the spot

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.060
Luzhou crossing the river, a small matter

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:42.260
Small matter

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:43.660
I'll pay

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.060
How much do you have here?

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:49.019
One silver dollar

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.660
Two thousand eight hundred and sixty coppers

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.060
Not even enough for the principal

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.019
Two porcelain jars

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:09.579
A basket of vegetables

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.619
Plus a chunk of cured meat

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.540
What is this stuff?

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:14.220
Who wants this?

00:04:32.179 --> 00:04:33.780
High-quality silk

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.419
It's worth some money

00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:42.859
I don't need this anymore

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:45.939
The account is still far off

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:48.819
The account is still far off

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:54.059
A Jianghu emergency

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.059
I need to give my brother an explanation

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:29.819
Respect

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.140
Consider it done

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.259
Brother

00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:48.460
Not giving me face?

00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:57.059
Brother

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.379
You win

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.900
Today, this Banner of Brotherhood

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:03.220
Is yours to plant

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:06.179
Let's split

00:06:12.859 --> 00:06:13.460
Brother Fan

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.980
I will never forget your kindness

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:18.059
Get up, get up, quick

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:19.220
Get up

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.059
I truly consider you my master

00:06:25.739 --> 00:06:27.259
Hold on, let me sit a bit

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.100
Scarface

00:06:31.179 --> 00:06:32.580
You're playing the saint

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.619
We didn't collect enough debt

00:06:33.739 --> 00:06:35.059
How do we report to the Boss?

00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:36.580
Money is a small matter

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:37.859
How do I usually teach you?

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:39.379
In the underworld

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:40.419
Righteousness comes first

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.059
Don't look at that fool acting silly

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:43.540
He's loyal and has guts

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.259
We who are in the life respect Guan Gong

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:46.460
We can't give a hero a hard time

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.460
But the Boss will give us a hard time

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.059
The new guy from last month

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.660
Didn't collect the debt

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.259
Went back and got a leg broken

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.220
We're short so much money this time

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:55.739
I'm afraid someone's gonna die

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:58.939
Then let's not go back for now

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:01.540
So what do we do?

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.460
Take it one step at a time

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.939
What a disgrace

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:08.660
You disgrace, you disgrace

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.220
I told you to collect a debt

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.819
And you come back looking like this

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:14.499
You squandered all that money

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:16.460
I ran into bandits

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:17.619
What could I do?

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.499
Bandits? I'm the bandit!

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:20.619
Granduncle, Granduncle

00:07:21.179 --> 00:07:22.020
Granduncle

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.700
The bandits beat me, now you want to beat me too?

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:26.780
Go ahead and hit me

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.980
The Fan family line will end

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:31.660
Granduncle, if you want to hit someone, hit me

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:33.379
He managed to come back alive

00:07:33.499 --> 00:07:34.660
That wasn't easy

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:35.299
He...

00:07:35.739 --> 00:07:38.059
You believe that nonsense he says?

00:07:38.859 --> 00:07:39.939
I believe him

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.299
Look at the state of him

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.460
He was definitely bullied

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.059
Just spare him

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.020
I fought ten of them alone

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.059
Good thing I practice usually

00:08:07.259 --> 00:08:08.619
Does it really hurt that much?

00:08:09.379 --> 00:08:11.220
If I didn't scream my head off

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.220
Would Granduncle let me off?

00:08:14.059 --> 00:08:16.580
Good thing you were here today

00:08:16.859 --> 00:08:19.859
Otherwise I'd suffer without daring to make a sound

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:21.220
Speak up

00:08:22.059 --> 00:08:22.859
Where's the money?

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:25.580
Uh oh

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.819
I married a sharp wife

00:08:29.179 --> 00:08:30.259
Confess honestly

00:08:33.259 --> 00:08:35.100
You went to pay someone else's debt

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:36.739
Who did you pay for?

00:08:37.379 --> 00:08:38.180
Wen Yan

00:08:38.859 --> 00:08:39.659
Which Wen Yan?

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:41.580
That opera singer Wen Yan

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:44.539
Gently, please

00:08:45.019 --> 00:08:46.420
Wen Yan

00:08:46.739 --> 00:08:48.859
She's the star of the opera troupe

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.460
She's the master I haven't bowed to yet

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.060
You sure are loyal

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.539
Of course

00:08:56.739 --> 00:08:58.060
When Master is in trouble

00:08:58.259 --> 00:09:00.340
The disciple will never flake out

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.659
Then in your heart

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.220
Is the master important

00:09:07.779 --> 00:09:09.460
Or is the wife important?

00:09:09.539 --> 00:09:10.139
Wife

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.539
Heaven, Earth, Sovereign, Parent, Teacher

00:09:12.619 --> 00:09:14.300
You rank ahead of them all

00:09:17.539 --> 00:09:19.019
So, is she pretty?

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:20.739
Not as pretty as you

00:09:24.659 --> 00:09:25.859
I don't believe a word you say

00:09:26.259 --> 00:09:28.060
Really not as pretty as you

00:09:38.259 --> 00:09:39.499
I had this made especially for you

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:40.580
It's a gift

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.220
It's a bit heavy

00:09:44.379 --> 00:09:45.420
You don't have to wear it

00:09:45.859 --> 00:09:47.779
Just keep it under your pillow

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:51.779
All right

00:09:54.859 --> 00:09:57.100
You shouldn't go out anymore

00:09:57.379 --> 00:09:59.499
Don't worry about things outside

00:10:00.539 --> 00:10:03.460
Then what's the point of living?

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.259
Just settle down and live with me

00:10:06.859 --> 00:10:07.580
Fine

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:08.779
Tonight

00:10:08.779 --> 00:10:11.619
Let's enjoy our life together

00:10:13.539 --> 00:10:15.499
I should have let Patriarch Fan

00:10:15.499 --> 00:10:17.539
Give you a sound beating

00:10:17.619 --> 00:10:19.220
You wouldn't have the heart to

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.100
You're hurt this bad already

00:10:22.859 --> 00:10:23.980
It won't get in the way, really

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:24.700
Young Master

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.460
The medicine Patriarch Fan ordered

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.259
Darn it

00:10:32.259 --> 00:10:33.859
I'm not here, I'm not here

00:10:36.899 --> 00:10:37.739
It won't get in the way

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:39.700
You really are...

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.100
Something big has happened

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.820
Gentlemen

00:11:21.019 --> 00:11:23.060
It's a disaster

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.259
Something big has happened

00:11:25.259 --> 00:11:26.859
Don't rush, don't rush

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:27.619
Sit down and speak

00:11:27.619 --> 00:11:28.899
Everyone sit down, sit down

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.580
You have no idea

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:35.980
In the dead of night yesterday

00:11:36.379 --> 00:11:38.019
Ma Laohu's bandits

00:11:38.259 --> 00:11:40.300
Barged into my humble home

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.899
They looted all my stored grain

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.460
They also want our town

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:48.100
To scrape together a fixed quota

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.060
Of money and grain as tribute every year

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:51.859
If we don't pay up

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.060
They'll start a massacre

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:55.779
Before they left

00:11:56.139 --> 00:11:58.739
They even broke one of my legs

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.139
This injury will take a hundred days to heal

00:12:01.139 --> 00:12:04.899
I know they're killing the chicken to scare the monkey

00:12:07.379 --> 00:12:09.580
Can you change to a different cat call?

00:12:09.899 --> 00:12:11.379
That cat of yours sounds awful

00:12:11.379 --> 00:12:12.180
I'll change it then

00:12:14.659 --> 00:12:15.259
This is a ghost wailing

00:12:15.259 --> 00:12:16.060
Wolf

00:12:16.139 --> 00:12:17.100
Young Master Fan

00:12:18.779 --> 00:12:20.300
Please accept our bow

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.060
We greased our heels and fled back then

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.820
Today we're here to apologize

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.300
I can smash stones on my chest

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.499
But I can't smash guns

00:12:26.619 --> 00:12:27.539
I can shoot sparrows

00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:28.580
But I can't shoot bullets

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:31.180
Brother Fan, we let you down

00:12:31.539 --> 00:12:34.139
From now on, we brothers will train hard

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:35.539
We won't embarrass you

00:12:35.659 --> 00:12:37.180
What are you doing?

00:12:37.659 --> 00:12:40.019
Get up, get up. We're all brothers here

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.340
Master Wen was my business anyway

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.420
It had nothing to do with you guys

00:12:46.739 --> 00:12:47.980
Did you see that?

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.980
Young Master Fan really is magnanimous

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:54.539
You are Zhao Zilong of Changbanpo

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.580
You are Zhang Yide of Dangyang Bridge

00:12:56.659 --> 00:12:59.220
You are Guan Yunchang of the Five Passes and Six Generals

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.700
You are our Big Brother Fan

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.739
What Big Brother?

00:13:07.019 --> 00:13:08.379
Eldest Senior Brother is the Big Brother

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:09.259
No, no, no

00:13:09.539 --> 00:13:12.379
You fought Scarface with a bear's heart and tiger's gall

00:13:12.379 --> 00:13:13.499
I am ashamed to be inferior

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:14.619
From now on

00:13:14.619 --> 00:13:16.659
We brothers will follow your lead

00:13:18.379 --> 00:13:19.739
Brother Fan

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.580
Your first task as Big Brother is quite tricky

00:13:23.659 --> 00:13:25.019
Now that these bandits are here

00:13:25.019 --> 00:13:27.180
Life was already tough for us brothers,

00:13:27.619 --> 00:13:29.259
and now it's gone from bad to worse.

00:13:32.899 --> 00:13:33.539
It's all your fault.

00:13:33.659 --> 00:13:35.820
When bandits rob the rich, you should stay away.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:36.940
But you called us over to watch the show.

00:13:37.019 --> 00:13:37.779
To gawk at the spectacle.

00:13:37.779 --> 00:13:38.460
Exactly.

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.460
So the bandits robbed us too while they were at it.

00:13:40.619 --> 00:13:41.899
We hadn't collected enough debts to begin with,

00:13:41.899 --> 00:13:43.379
and now we have nothing left at all.

00:13:43.499 --> 00:13:45.300
How are we supposed to explain this to the boss?

00:13:45.499 --> 00:13:46.100
How was I supposed to know?

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.460
That the famous Ma Laohu gang

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.220
wouldn't even let small fry like us go?

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:50.619
And you too, Scarface.

00:13:50.779 --> 00:13:52.139
When Ma Laohu's men were robbing us,

00:13:52.379 --> 00:13:53.379
you should have pulled your weapon.

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.220
You lot are like old sows in a vegetable garden—

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:58.379
all you know how to do is run your mouths.

00:13:59.019 --> 00:14:00.420
I've only got one gun.

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:01.580
Ma Laohu has so many guns.

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:02.700
You think I can outshoot them?

00:14:02.859 --> 00:14:04.820
We need to report this to the authorities.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.700
In times like these,

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.580
those with guns make the rules.

00:14:08.619 --> 00:14:10.220
I'm afraid it might backfire on us.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.420
It won't.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.379
No matter how fierce the bandits are,

00:14:13.379 --> 00:14:15.300
they're still afraid of the army.

00:14:15.499 --> 00:14:17.820
Straw sandal fees, ammo fees, pursuit fees...

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:19.619
They'll fleece you for a fortune first.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:20.899
Once the soldiers have had their fill

00:14:20.899 --> 00:14:22.060
and leave,

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:23.820
Ma Laohu will come back for revenge.

00:14:23.899 --> 00:14:25.700
That's what you call a double whammy—

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.300
suffering at both ends.

00:14:27.739 --> 00:14:29.060
So what do we do?

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.300
I'll volunteer myself.

00:14:30.779 --> 00:14:32.100
I'll go negotiate with the bandits.

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.180
They've always been honorable.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:36.019
If we can buy some peace and quiet,

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.139
paying a little tribute

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.220
is nothing.

00:14:38.659 --> 00:14:40.060
If you ask me,

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.100
rather than taking this money and grain

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.700
and letting Ma Laohu's bandits waste it,

00:14:43.859 --> 00:14:46.940
we'd be better off offering it to Commander Liao

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.700
in exchange for his protection.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.499
They've all got fangs.

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:51.859
There isn't one that doesn't eat people.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.899
They've been suppressing bandits for years,

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.499
but have they ever wiped them out?

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.899
It's like getting married on a theater stage—

00:14:58.420 --> 00:14:59.659
it's all just for show.

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.100
Patriarch Fan,

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.259
you're a respected elder here.

00:15:05.779 --> 00:15:07.379
You have to come up with a plan for us.

00:15:07.659 --> 00:15:09.700
Give us some advice.

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.580
Why does this thunder keep crashing?

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:24.700
Fan Bao.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.220
You go take a look.

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.220
What's the matter?

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:28.100
Okay.

00:15:32.499 --> 00:15:33.420
Patriarch.

00:15:33.859 --> 00:15:35.060
Where am I supposed to look?

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.300
If I knew where to look...

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:37.460
why would I be asking you?

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.300
Now we'll have to be beggars.

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:43.619
Scarface.

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.460
How about we go to the opera house again?

00:15:45.619 --> 00:15:47.420
Maybe we'll run into that fat kid from last time.

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:48.460
Judging by his looks,

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:49.619
he must come from money.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.700
We'll make him cough up more cash.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.100
Anyway, he didn't give enough last time.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:53.420
What are you talking about?

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:55.659
I'm a man of the world.

00:15:55.659 --> 00:15:57.019
A deal is a deal.

00:15:57.019 --> 00:15:58.060
I never go back on my word.

00:15:58.580 --> 00:15:59.820
You're so honorable.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:00.899
We don't have any money now.

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:02.460
We really are going to have to beg.

00:16:02.659 --> 00:16:03.779
If the Master finds out,

00:16:03.859 --> 00:16:05.899
we won't live long enough to beg.

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.060
Ma Laohu and those bandits...

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:16.100
always act so brazenly.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:17.499
And they get away with it.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.300
That is because

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.859
no one recognizes them.

00:16:21.379 --> 00:16:23.300
No one knows where they're from,

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:24.940
nor do they know

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.980
where they hide out.

00:16:27.499 --> 00:16:28.460
Every time they pull a job,

00:16:28.619 --> 00:16:29.700
they leave the word "Ma".

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.300
To show it was Ma Laohu's crew.

00:16:32.619 --> 00:16:33.420
Unlike us.

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:34.899
Scared to leave a single trace.

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:36.460
How can you compare us

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:37.580
to those bandits?

00:16:38.019 --> 00:16:39.499
We're different from them.

00:16:39.619 --> 00:16:40.580
What's different?

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:42.300
We can be the same.

00:16:42.379 --> 00:16:43.899
Relying on bandits for troops

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.060
is like drinking poison to quench thirst.

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.420
The backlash is extremely dangerous.

00:16:48.619 --> 00:16:50.899
Better to reorganize the militia.

00:16:51.019 --> 00:16:52.619
Better to rely on oneself than others.

00:16:52.859 --> 00:16:54.940
Each family contributes troops for self-defense.

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.300
To escape the grip of soldiers and bandits.

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:58.700
Darn it.

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.100
We'll just have to go rob someone.

00:17:00.499 --> 00:17:01.700
Keep it down, keep it down.

00:17:01.859 --> 00:17:02.980
To cover this debt.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.420
Then wouldn't we be bandits?

00:17:04.779 --> 00:17:05.820
We'll disguise ourselves as bandits.

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.379
Bandits are robbing us,

00:17:07.499 --> 00:17:09.420
so we'll let them take the blame.

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:10.099
Do you understand?

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:11.220
They rob openly,

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:12.299
we steal secretly.

00:17:12.299 --> 00:17:13.220
This obviously isn't

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.499
how bandits operate.

00:17:14.499 --> 00:17:16.099
Who says bandits can't steal?

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:17.620
Boss.

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:21.539
We can also leave a "Ma" character.

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:24.180
Let those bastard bandits

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:25.900
take the fall no matter what.

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:26.779
Also,

00:17:27.299 --> 00:17:29.579
notify the young men of every clan.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.299
Restate the clan rules.

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:32.620
No matter who it is,

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.460
anyone who becomes a bandit will be beheaded.

00:17:36.019 --> 00:17:36.819
Colluding with bandits,

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:37.980
buried alive.

00:17:38.299 --> 00:17:38.980
Right.

00:17:39.339 --> 00:17:41.099
Harsh times call for harsh laws.

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:42.739
Whatever plan you have, Boss,

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.420
we'll do whatever you say.

00:17:45.579 --> 00:17:46.380
Brother Fan.

00:17:47.019 --> 00:17:48.059
Brother Fan.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.220
In these lean years,

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.499
bandits are everywhere.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.380
Warlords are carving up the land.

00:17:55.579 --> 00:17:57.620
Total chaos is coming.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.779
The world is descending into chaos again.

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:08.019
Bow to Heaven, Earth, and Guan Gong

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.860
Betray the brothers and you'll suffer

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:11.460
Loyalty and courage shine like the sun and moon

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.019
Greenwood heroes shed their hot blood

00:18:13.019 --> 00:18:15.019
Kill the rich, help the poor, the Brotherhood

00:18:15.019 --> 00:18:17.460
The poor folks all say it's right

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.299
Right

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:22.940
Brothers

00:18:23.299 --> 00:18:24.299
Let's discuss this

00:18:24.579 --> 00:18:25.779
Which rich family is suitable?

00:18:25.779 --> 00:18:27.299
In my opinion, the Wang family

00:18:27.299 --> 00:18:28.299
That won't do

00:18:28.499 --> 00:18:30.220
Old Man Wang just got his leg broken

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.299
Going again would break the rules of the Jianghu

00:18:32.299 --> 00:18:33.700
I think we should go to the Qian family

00:18:33.819 --> 00:18:34.819
The Qian family has lots of money

00:18:34.819 --> 00:18:35.620
The Qian family

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:37.019
The Qians have many people and many dogs

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:38.099
And guns too

00:18:38.099 --> 00:18:39.940
Why smash an egg against a rock?

00:18:40.019 --> 00:18:40.900
If you ask me

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:41.700
The Ji family

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:42.980
The Ji family's walls are low

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:43.900
Easier to climb over

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.140
I won't do it

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:46.460
Grandma Ji, when I was little

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:47.700
She washed my diapers

00:18:48.099 --> 00:18:49.620
I say, the Chen family

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:51.299
The dog hole is big, easy to crawl through

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:52.660
Discussing like this

00:18:52.819 --> 00:18:54.220
We won't have a result by tomorrow morning

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:55.700
Big Brother, be decisive

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:57.220
Fine, stop talking

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:58.819
Let's settle it with a finger game

00:18:59.299 --> 00:19:00.700
You represent the Wang family

00:19:01.059 --> 00:19:02.460
You represent the Qian family

00:19:02.739 --> 00:19:04.059
You represent the Ji family

00:19:04.299 --> 00:19:05.700
You represent the Chen family

00:19:05.739 --> 00:19:07.579
I'll represent our Fan family

00:19:07.779 --> 00:19:08.660
Whoever loses

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.059
That's the family we rob

00:19:10.059 --> 00:19:11.099
Deal, deal

00:19:11.099 --> 00:19:11.980
Come on, come on

00:19:12.579 --> 00:19:13.739
Random chopping!

00:19:13.739 --> 00:19:14.739
Eight horses!

00:19:14.739 --> 00:19:15.860
Five leaders!

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:16.819
You lost

00:19:17.499 --> 00:19:18.660
Random chopping!

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:19.579
Two brothers good!

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:21.420
You're done for, you're done for

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.099
Random chopping!

00:19:23.099 --> 00:19:24.220
Eight horses

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:25.980
You're done for again

00:19:26.299 --> 00:19:27.700
Random chopping!

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:28.900
Blow on empty!

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.059
Little Sister Seven is cute!

00:19:30.059 --> 00:19:31.420
All have it!

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:32.460
You lost

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:33.860
Rob the Fan family

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:35.299
Rob the Fan family

00:19:35.579 --> 00:19:37.299
What? Rob the Fan family?

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.299
Big Brother, how about this doesn't count?

00:19:40.299 --> 00:19:41.099
Let's play another round

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.499
What do you mean doesn't count?

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:44.339
Brothers, hearts aligned

00:19:44.339 --> 00:19:47.019
Children of the Jianghu never flake out

00:19:48.059 --> 00:19:49.499
We rob whoever loses

00:19:49.499 --> 00:19:50.819
We agreed on it

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:52.420
My family

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:53.980
Has lots of grain

00:19:54.099 --> 00:19:55.259
Most importantly

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:56.940
Robbing my own house

00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.059
It's not easy to get caught

00:19:59.499 --> 00:20:00.779
We'll listen to Big Brother

00:20:01.259 --> 00:20:02.220
Good

00:20:07.499 --> 00:20:10.380
You're the only one here who can handle a gun or stick

00:20:11.819 --> 00:20:13.220
If you encounter any situation

00:20:14.019 --> 00:20:15.700
Fire a warning shot

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:18.059
The town militia

00:20:18.499 --> 00:20:20.019
Will rush to the rescue

00:20:20.339 --> 00:20:21.420
When night falls

00:20:22.299 --> 00:20:23.700
Lock the front door

00:20:24.099 --> 00:20:25.259
Bar the back door

00:20:25.779 --> 00:20:28.460
You arrange the night watch

00:20:29.259 --> 00:20:30.059
Will do

00:20:31.499 --> 00:20:32.739
Give me the gun

00:20:37.299 --> 00:20:39.099
Yes, sir

00:20:50.019 --> 00:20:51.420
You must remember

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:54.700
I'll watch the first half of the night

00:20:55.299 --> 00:20:56.819
You watch the second half

00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:59.499
Why don't we watch together?

00:20:59.819 --> 00:21:00.980
Who wants to watch with you?

00:21:01.499 --> 00:21:04.220
In the second half, I'll be sleepy

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.019
Give me the gun

00:21:09.059 --> 00:21:11.860
You caught too many sparrows as a kid, your hand shakes

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.099
It's easy to misfire

00:21:15.099 --> 00:21:16.380
Your hands are shaking too

00:21:30.259 --> 00:21:31.220
Oh no, oh no

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:32.579
Senior Brother, someone's coming

00:21:32.579 --> 00:21:33.420
Someone's coming

00:21:58.860 --> 00:21:59.900
How could it be him?

00:22:02.259 --> 00:22:03.700
Didn't you scout it out already?

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:05.019
We've walked this way so many times.

00:22:05.019 --> 00:22:06.019
Which house are we stealing from anyway?

00:22:07.259 --> 00:22:08.140
This place in the daytime versus at night...

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:09.299
...looks completely different.

00:22:09.539 --> 00:22:11.059
What do I need you for?

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:24.980
Heaven helps me.

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:26.779
Ma Laohu

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:29.019
You're definitely taking the blame for this.

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:38.259
Don't move.

00:22:40.259 --> 00:22:41.259
Hands up.

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:43.180
Get down.

00:22:51.819 --> 00:22:53.539
Why did you come so late?

00:22:54.059 --> 00:22:54.700
Go.

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:56.299
Straight into the granary.

00:22:56.739 --> 00:22:57.380
Go.

00:22:59.819 --> 00:23:00.620
Go.

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.660
Why did Brother Fan change his mind?

00:23:14.299 --> 00:23:15.299
Playing with them...

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:17.140
...and not playing with us anymore?

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:18.819
You fool.

00:23:41.539 --> 00:23:42.980
Everyone go hide for a few days.

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:46.180
If anything happens, I'll take the heat.

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:48.220
Don't say a word.

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:49.259
Go.

00:24:02.019 --> 00:24:04.059
Why is "bed" written there?

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.660
Are you going to confess now?

00:24:22.019 --> 00:24:23.660
It's him.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:24.900
Who?

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.220
Those thieves.

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:29.579
I don't recognize a single one.

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.900
I only recognize the Young Master.

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:34.940
Did you see clearly?

00:24:35.019 --> 00:24:37.099
It is him.

00:24:38.019 --> 00:24:40.660
My butt! My butt!

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:43.660
Sha'er.

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:46.940
Sha'er.

00:24:48.579 --> 00:24:50.180
You've committed a serious crime.

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.299
What is it?

00:24:52.099 --> 00:24:53.980
Fan Bao confessed everything.

00:24:54.499 --> 00:24:56.259
Tell me, why are you so stupid?

00:24:56.259 --> 00:24:57.140
You help others...

00:24:57.339 --> 00:24:58.900
...move grain from your own house.

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:00.900
My family has plenty of grain.

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:03.299
Giving away some unhusked rice is no big deal.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:05.700
Rules were set this time.

00:25:06.099 --> 00:25:08.700
It's either beheading or being buried alive.

00:25:09.059 --> 00:25:11.099
I don't believe Patriarch Fan would tell me to die.

00:25:11.499 --> 00:25:12.099
Come on.

00:25:12.299 --> 00:25:13.019
Come on, let's play a bit.

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.299
Get up.

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:18.099
You sure are carefree.

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:19.900
Hurry up and go see Patriarch Fan.

00:25:20.019 --> 00:25:21.739
Confess who your accomplices are.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:23.140
Maybe Patriarch Fan...

00:25:23.779 --> 00:25:24.860
...will still spare you.

00:25:25.059 --> 00:25:26.299
How can I do that?

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:29.299
Children of the Jianghu never flake out.

00:25:29.539 --> 00:25:30.940
How would I get by in the future?

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:33.499
Can't you just make up a few names...

00:25:33.739 --> 00:25:34.900
...to hold them off for now?

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:36.220
Young Master.

00:25:39.059 --> 00:25:40.220
Young Master.

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.339
The Patriarch wants to see you.

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:45.460
You son of a turtle, you dog.

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:47.579
You disgraceful sellout! I...

00:25:47.739 --> 00:25:48.380
Kick.

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:49.620
One kick.

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:52.099
You betrayed me!

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:53.499
I know you're not happy with me.

00:25:53.499 --> 00:25:54.940
Don't kick here.

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:56.180
Kick here instead.

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:57.220
Here, kick however you want.

00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:58.180
Here, kick any way you like.

00:25:58.180 --> 00:25:59.299
Damn it.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:01.380
Stand still.

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:02.380
Stand still for me!

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:04.140
What's the use of hitting him?

00:26:05.339 --> 00:26:06.140
Patriarch.

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:07.539
Help me, Patriarch!

00:26:08.779 --> 00:26:09.579
Stand still.

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.299
He and I were just messing around.

00:26:13.299 --> 00:26:15.739
Messing around? Was it you...

00:26:19.019 --> 00:26:20.539
...and who else?

00:26:25.299 --> 00:26:26.339
There's Fan Bao

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:28.860
Patriarch, not me

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:29.779
Not me

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:31.259
Zhang Mangzi

00:26:31.499 --> 00:26:32.700
Young Master, don't talk nonsense

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:33.739
How am I involved?

00:26:33.739 --> 00:26:34.420
Tong Wazi

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:35.779
I'm not in it

00:26:35.779 --> 00:26:36.620
Qin Dahan'er

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:37.259
Young Master

00:26:37.259 --> 00:26:38.339
It's not me

00:26:38.499 --> 00:26:39.299
Mama Zhang

00:26:39.739 --> 00:26:40.779
Not me, not me

00:26:40.779 --> 00:26:42.180
They were all involved

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:44.739
Absolute rubbish!

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:46.059
The way you put it,

00:26:46.059 --> 00:26:47.339
my house of scholars

00:26:47.339 --> 00:26:49.980
has become a den of thieves!

00:26:50.259 --> 00:26:50.900
You said not to say it

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:52.339
So I won't say it

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:55.499
You'll be the death of me

00:26:55.499 --> 00:26:57.900
Patriarch Fan, don't get too worked up

00:26:58.059 --> 00:27:00.339
Just give him a beating and be done with it

00:27:00.579 --> 00:27:03.059
Patriarch Fan, don't be angry either

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:05.180
Your eagerness to protect your grandson,

00:27:05.539 --> 00:27:06.819
we all understand clearly

00:27:07.099 --> 00:27:08.499
To be honest,

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:10.660
if one's own son made a mistake,

00:27:11.059 --> 00:27:12.380
wouldn't one want to...

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:14.299
This isn't a mistake

00:27:14.499 --> 00:27:16.059
This is a crime

00:27:18.579 --> 00:27:21.059
If it were our children,

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:23.420
Patriarch Fan,

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:26.059
I'm afraid you'd handle it impartially

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:31.380
What the hell are you saying?

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:32.900
Do you have any idea?

00:27:33.059 --> 00:27:34.539
For miles around here,

00:27:34.539 --> 00:27:36.579
Patriarch Fan is highly respected

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:37.980
His word carries weight

00:27:38.099 --> 00:27:40.299
He is the representative of fairness and justice

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:42.299
He means what he says

00:27:42.299 --> 00:27:44.460
How could he have double standards?

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:48.140
If we all acted on emotion and not reason,

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:49.739
then this town of ours

00:27:49.739 --> 00:27:51.140
would have fallen apart long ago

00:27:56.019 --> 00:27:57.339
I'll ask you one more time

00:27:58.299 --> 00:28:00.299
That 'Ma' character on the backyard wall,

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:02.220
did you write it?

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:05.460
I wrote it for fun

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:06.980
So what?

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.180
Is writing a crime now?

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:12.180
Just wrote it for fun

00:28:14.099 --> 00:28:14.980
Lock him up!

00:28:18.019 --> 00:28:18.660
What?

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:20.900
What, what, what?

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:23.299
Granduncle

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:25.779
Are you really going to be ruthless?

00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:29.180
Handle it impartially?

00:28:30.019 --> 00:28:30.739
Fine

00:28:31.019 --> 00:28:31.700
Fine

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.140
You can't do this!

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:35.460
You can't do this!

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:42.299
Everyone,

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.339
right here and now,

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:47.940
the times are chaotic,

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.380
with trouble inside and out.

00:28:51.579 --> 00:28:53.900
Today, in this small town of ours,

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:56.900
peaceful days are hard to come by.

00:28:58.539 --> 00:29:02.180
It relies on everyone's joint efforts.

00:29:02.739 --> 00:29:05.739
But a single rat dropping ruins the soup.

00:29:06.739 --> 00:29:09.980
First, bandits raided my humble home at night.

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:12.180
Then, at the Fan family's,

00:29:12.499 --> 00:29:14.180
so much grain

00:29:14.339 --> 00:29:16.539
vanished overnight.

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:18.019
Guard by day, guard by night,

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:20.299
but a thief within is hard to guard against.

00:29:20.579 --> 00:29:22.059
I shouldn't have to say who.

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:26.700
Fan Pengju!

00:29:27.579 --> 00:29:28.739
Turn around and face me.

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:31.779
You!

00:29:32.339 --> 00:29:34.180
You are that rat dropping!

00:29:34.579 --> 00:29:35.180
You!

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:36.779
You are that thief within!

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:39.660
Fan Pengju.

00:29:40.499 --> 00:29:42.739
One look at the handwriting proves it wasn't you.

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.579
Was it someone else?

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:47.299
You need to understand,

00:29:48.099 --> 00:29:50.620
is it thievery or banditry?

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:53.259
Patriarch Fan,

00:29:53.579 --> 00:29:55.140
don't be anxious.

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:58.220
If he names his accomplices and isn't a bandit,

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:00.140
he can avoid the death penalty.

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:01.539
If he doesn't confess,

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:03.660
then he'll be treated as a bandit collaborator.

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:08.700
This is the rule you set yourself, sir.

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:11.140
Those who collaborate with bandits,

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:14.940
are buried alive.

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:19.700
I wrote the words.

00:30:20.779 --> 00:30:22.579
I sent the signal too.

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:24.860
Good people can do bad things,

00:30:25.339 --> 00:30:28.099
so why can't bad people do good things?

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:29.660
Fan Pengju!

00:30:30.339 --> 00:30:31.380
You're talking nonsense!

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:33.059
Do you know the consequences?

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:34.940
A life is at stake!

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:36.779
Under these circumstances,

00:30:36.779 --> 00:30:38.499
you're still spouting rubbish!

00:30:38.779 --> 00:30:40.339
You need to be clear,

00:30:40.739 --> 00:30:42.900
thief or bandit?

00:30:43.259 --> 00:30:44.819
Make it clear!

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:47.059
Me and my brothers,

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:49.940
we bow to Heaven, Earth, and Guan Gong.

00:30:50.779 --> 00:30:52.980
Enforcing justice for Heaven, supported by all.

00:30:53.099 --> 00:30:55.620
Killing the rich to aid the poor, the Brotherhood.

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:58.380
The poor folks all say we're right.

00:30:58.499 --> 00:31:01.380
We are an army of chivalry.

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:06.819
So you admit to collaborating with bandits.

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:08.900
Patriarch.

00:31:09.299 --> 00:31:10.099
Patriarch.

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:11.739
Sha'er didn't mean that.

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:12.779
He didn't collaborate with bandits.

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.180
He really didn't collaborate.

00:31:15.099 --> 00:31:15.940
Granduncle!

00:31:17.819 --> 00:31:18.860
He brought this sin on himself,

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:20.700
he cannot live.

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:22.499
Let him go.

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:25.339
Silly child.

00:31:25.779 --> 00:31:26.900
He already admitted his guilt.

00:31:33.339 --> 00:31:34.739
All rise!

00:31:37.739 --> 00:31:38.940
Take him to the execution ground!

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:41.339
Sha'er!

00:31:42.019 --> 00:31:42.700
Sha'er!

00:31:43.019 --> 00:31:43.620
Sha'er!

00:31:44.299 --> 00:31:45.819
Sha'er, you can't go!

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:47.860
What will I do if you leave?

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:48.819
Yuzhen.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:51.059
Stop crying and wiping your tears.

00:31:51.259 --> 00:31:52.259
Like this,

00:31:52.259 --> 00:31:54.900
how can I be a hero?

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:55.499
Move!

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:57.339
Then I won't live either!

00:31:57.539 --> 00:31:59.140
I'll go with you!

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.099
Let go!

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:01.819
Move!

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:02.380
Sha'er!

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:03.700
Stay strong!

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:04.819
Move!

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:07.460
Sha'er! Sha'er! Sha'er!

00:32:09.019 --> 00:32:09.739
Young Mistress!

00:32:09.819 --> 00:32:10.460
Young Mistress!

00:32:11.059 --> 00:32:11.779
Young Mistress!

00:32:13.579 --> 00:32:18.900
I hate Yang Guang for slaying the loyal,

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:32.940
slanderous ministers are in power.

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:41.860
Thinking of my parents, I cannot help it,

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:52.579
tears soak my battle robe.

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:04.259
A misfortune for the family

00:33:05.539 --> 00:33:07.259
To have birthed this vile spawn

00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:10.460
Of improper conduct

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:13.140
Betraying his own kin

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:15.739
Unrepentant despite discipline

00:33:16.259 --> 00:33:18.739
Self-exiled from the Fan clan

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:21.259
To pacify the region

00:33:21.739 --> 00:33:24.339
Capital punishment: live burial

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:27.980
Capital punishment: live burial

00:33:28.259 --> 00:33:30.940
Patriarch, you must think this through

00:33:31.259 --> 00:33:32.460
Let's not talk about that

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:34.940
I blame neither heaven nor earth

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:36.339
Nor do I blame myself

00:33:36.819 --> 00:33:38.140
I've lived this long

00:33:39.539 --> 00:33:40.339
Today

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:42.819
I'll go out in style for once

00:33:44.539 --> 00:33:47.499
Everyone has to die sooner or later

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:51.299
Rather than leave weeping and wailing

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:53.660
I'd prefer to die happily

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:55.499
In eighteen years

00:33:55.819 --> 00:33:57.539
I'll be a hero again

00:34:03.019 --> 00:34:04.779
Which blind fool dug this?

00:34:05.499 --> 00:34:06.499
It's so shallow

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:09.299
It won't be worth it if dogs dig me up later

00:34:09.539 --> 00:34:10.099
Brother

00:34:11.259 --> 00:34:13.019
Dig deeper. Do me a favor, dig deeper

00:34:13.019 --> 00:34:13.940
Young Master

00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:15.860
Young Master

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:16.940
Young Master!

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:18.460
I've failed you!

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:19.980
What are you crying for?

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:24.900
Let me tell you

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:26.740
When I jump down in a moment

00:34:27.019 --> 00:34:28.219
And lie flat

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:30.099
Only then can you cover me with dirt

00:34:30.499 --> 00:34:31.300
Do you hear me?

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:33.659
Fan Pengju

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:37.300
You really are a fool

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:42.499
You're the fool

00:34:44.019 --> 00:34:46.099
You smashed the incense burner

00:34:46.539 --> 00:34:47.820
When you die later

00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:50.900
No one will carry your spirit tablet

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:07.699
Darn it

00:35:08.579 --> 00:35:11.940
Lost my life over a finger-guessing game

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:14.099
Not worth it

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:19.139
Young Master
