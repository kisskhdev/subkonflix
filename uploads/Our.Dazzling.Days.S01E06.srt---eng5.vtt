[Our Dazzling Days]

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.780
[Episode 6]

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.080
All right, guys.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.310
Let's look at this question.

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.150
As for this one,

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.880
I know some of you
still don't know how to solve it.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.509
It is a bit difficult.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.759
Mr. Gu,

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.039
stop the class for a moment.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.880
Your class caused this incident!

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:03.970
Mind you, I know who it was!

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.010
Whoever did it,

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.970
step forward right now!

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.940
You've got some nerve.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.800
What? No one wants to admit it?

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.910
Fine.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.190
I'll give this saboteur

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.750
one last chance.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.520
Step forward now,

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.300
and I'll be lenient.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.870
If I have to check the handwriting
and figure out who did it,

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:35.940
whoever it is,

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.770
they'll be expelled right away!

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.030
Director.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.270
I posted them.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:50.960
I knew it was you.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.000
This just proves

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.650
that I was right about my judgment

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.980
of your poor character.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.080
Just wait to be expelled.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.630
Wait, you're deceiving us again.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.240
Didn't you just say you'd be lenient?

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.240
For you, you'll be

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.310
punished for multiple offenses.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.110
Director Hou,

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.470
don't listen to Xiaoman's nonsense.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.790
I wrote those criticism posters.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.030
It has nothing to do with him.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.680
Xia Lei!

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.840
You are still young.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.760
Don't take the fall for someone else

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.430
out of loyalty.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.590
Mr. Gu, it really was me.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.870
If you don't believe it,
look at the handwriting.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:23.520
L-Look.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.079
It definitely wasn't him. It was me.

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:25.740
You shut up!

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.910
Look, look at this handwriting.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.860
And... And that... that flyers were

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.950
also... also put up by me.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.120
It has nothing to do with anyone...

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.920
Director Hou!

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.310
I can testify that Xia Lei is lying.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.100
I'm not lying.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.100
You are.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.250
See? Huh?

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.480
Do you know who did it?

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.340
Anyway, he didn't do it alone.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.190
He did write the posters.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.829
But I printed the flyers.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.120
We put them up together.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.360
It has nothing to do with Xiaoman.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.530
He wasn't part of it at all.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.840
It has nothing to do with either of them.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.100
Who else was involved?

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:54.680
Me.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.040
Oh, my God.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:57.430
Meng Ge?

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.110
What did you do?

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.480
I didn't do anything.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:02.680
Why did you stand up

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.140
if you didn't do anything?

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.270
I leaked

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.950
the poster's content to them.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.500
Get the parents of the three of you

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.300
to the school.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.070
It's four, Director.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.000
You guys

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.089
really are out of your minds.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.530
Grades are the first priority right now.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.880
Sit down and get back to class.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.010
I'll talk to your parents after class!

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.650
[Teaching Building]

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:39.430
Mrs. Tong.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:42.460
You...

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.270
Where did you get the nerve?

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.070
What if you get officially punished?

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.920
Go... Hurry up.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.120
G-Go apologize to the Director.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.260
See if he'll forgive you.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.060
I'm not going.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.270
Mrs. Tong, Mrs. Tong.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.950
I'm not going. I won't go!

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.640
It was the Director's fault.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.370
I have nothing to hide. W-Why should I go?

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.600
N-Nothing to hide?

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.360
If so, why didn't you put them up

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.630
during the day?

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.290
Move aside.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.600
Why are you yelling at the kid?

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.240
Huh?

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.070
You never shut up.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:09.570
Just stay out of it.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:13.310
Mr. Ding.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.040
Do you think you were wrong?

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.480
I...

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:20.560
I-I was wrong.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.160
Wrong about what?

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.330
Why were you wrong?

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.270
If there was a mistake...

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.170
it's that you only posted them
at the school

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.100
and not at the plant headquarters.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.270
If I were you,
I'd have plastered them everywhere.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.200
I'd even have covered the ceiling.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.680
See? Mr. Ding's really something.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.070
How silver-tongued he is!

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.070
What a speech!

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.290
Dad.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.930
Made a fuss, huh?

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:03.960
It's already happened.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.960
The school will definitely
issue a punishment.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.300
But we can't accept a penalty mark

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:10.770
on the permanent record.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:12.270
Chief Engineer Yan is right.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.130
We absolutely can't accept that.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.380
So we're all on the same page.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.980
I'll do the talking when we go in.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.680
You...

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.720
Should I talk or not?

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.120
Just listen.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.800
W-What does this mean?

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.310
I have worked diligently,

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.270
dedicating my whole life to education.

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.510
I may not have
abundant students everywhere, right?

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.130
But give me credit for my hard work,
if not my achievements.

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:39.630
This was the first time someone

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:40.600
put up criticism posters about me.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.000
In the future, my work...

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.159
It's been a while since we last met,

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:45.960
Director Hou.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.120
Hello, Director.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.190
-Come on, sit down, please.
-Okay.

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.320
Have a seat, please.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.980
I was just outside,

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.030
and I heard everything you said.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.120
Indeed, after all these years,

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.450
we all know your reputation

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.240
in the school.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:05.980
Right?

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.310
Your achievements and credits are

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.060
evident to all.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.220
But this incident has already happened.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.670
I don't know
how the school plans to handle it.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.800
This incident has exerted

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.830
a terrible influence on the school.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:28.480
We must deal with it seriously

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.940
to make an example of them.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.860
Director, please don't.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.870
We f-failed to educate our child well.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.870
I'll have them come
apologize to you right now.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:36.560
Tong,

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.430
I don't think this is
about apologizing at all.

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:40.190
Sit down.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:46.280
I believe
the school will handle this carefully,

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.380
because it concerns the children's future.

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:50.470
Furthermore,

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.550
the school will also
consider its own interests,

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:54.140
right?

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.090
If this investigation continues

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:57.550
and the higher-ups learn that...

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:00.080
The content
written above is all fabricated.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.630
It is not true at all.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:05.110
We take pilot recruitment very seriously.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:07.360
But in our work,

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.380
slip-ups are inevitable.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.920
Where is the slip-up?

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:11.790
What slip-ups?

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:14.370
Sirs and madam,

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.870
before you came in,

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:17.430
I already admitted to Director Hou

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:18.630
that I made a mistake.

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:20.760
Here, I would also like to formally

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.040
apologize to you all.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.050
This is truly a misunderstanding.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:26.710
As the head teacher,

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.600
I didn't deliver the message properly.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.510
As a result,
the pilot recruitment information

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.110
did not reach every student,

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:35.169
causing today's misunderstanding.

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:38.580
Yan,

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.480
the situation is pretty clear now.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.510
It has nothing to do with the children.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:44.570
So why punish them?

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:46.870
Xiaoman, take the two of them back.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:47.610
Ding,

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:49.750
I disagree with you.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.410
I think we should take this opportunity

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.900
to teach them a good lesson

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.190
and let them know
the importance of following rules

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.070
and seeing the big picture.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:08:59.970
What happened? What is it?

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:01.270
I don't know.

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:03.200
I don't think he called me.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.270
That startled me.

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:09.570
Look at this mess. Well...

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.800
It was supposed to be my issue,

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:13.820
but you two were dragged into it.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.500
Thank you for your understanding,
Chief Engineer Yan.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.720
In handling this matter, the school

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.870
will definitely minimize the impact

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.530
and won't let it affect
the children's future.

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:29.440
"Won't let it affect
the children's future."

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.440
That's well said.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.480
Well, then...

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:36.790
About Xiaoman's pilot recruitment...

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:38.160
Here.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:41.480
Do you have
the Pilot Recruitment Office's number?

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.120
Yes, we do.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:43.910
Here, Director. Come on.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.390
Director, this one.

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:46.540
I'll call them right now.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:47.350
Right now.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:49.750
Immediate action.

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:52.160
Pilot Recruitment Office.

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.030
You three, come in.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.860
Director, I'm going to announce it.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:06.370
Okay.

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:10.320
Stand straight.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:14.010
I'm going to announce
the disciplinary decision.

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:16.630
This incident
stemmed from a misunderstanding,

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:18.870
but Xia Lei and Xiaodan's behaviors

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.840
still caused damage to the school.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.520
The school leaders and parents have agreed

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:25.600
to punish Xia Lei and Xiaodan

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.180
by making them
clean the teaching building for a month.

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:30.640
That's fair.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:31.660
As for Xiaoman,

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:34.150
the Director will contact
the Pilot Recruitment Office

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:36.610
to add your name
to the recommendation list.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:38.770
Make one more call
and see if anyone answers.

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:40.030
Okay, I'll call again.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:41.440
Calm down.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.310
Hello?

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.090
Is this the Pilot Recruitment Office?

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:53.960
This is Mr. Hou from Western Tiecheng
Dongfang Affiliated Middle School.

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:54.910
Yes, yes.

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:57.970
Here's the thing. Our school

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.020
would like to recommend
an additional student.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.050
He's excellent,

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.240
in great shape,

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:04.350
and very tall.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:06.900
His height?

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:08.480
1.87 meters.

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.820
1.9 meters with shoes on.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.670
He is 1.87 meters tall.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:14.970
Pardon?

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:19.730
So that's the case.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.960
Okay, yeah, I see.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.870
Thank you.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:27.720
Goodbye.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.960
Get ready.

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:30.710
To fill out the form?

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.420
Let's go! Time to take off!

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:34.130
You're over the limit.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.200
Over the limit by 2 centimeters.

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:39.960
So being tall is a problem?

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.810
With t-this height,

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:42.800
he'd e-even be leading the Honor Guard.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.710
Hear me out.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.390
For male pilots,

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:48.380
the maximum height is 1.85 meters.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.300
Why did you grow so tall?

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:51.880
Well...

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.750
I grew up eating everyone's food.

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:55.120
Eating here today, there tomorrow.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.360
Mrs. Tong's cooking is amazing,

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.870
and Mr. Ding feeds me
like livestock every day.

00:11:58.870 --> 00:11:59.630
Stop yapping.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:01.720
"Mr. Ding," "Mr. Ding."
Are you blaming us?

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.790
You must've secretly eaten
abundant feed yourself.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:05.300
Y-You call me over to eat every day...

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:05.990
Xiaoman,

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.320
I really tried to help you sincerely.

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:10.560
But it's okay.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.360
All roads lead to Rome.

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:14.840
With your build and height,

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:16.670
getting into a sports school is

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:17.710
also a good choice.

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:19.720
Getting into a sports school isn't
the same as flying a plane.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.270
Alright.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:21.930
Director Hou is right.

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:25.000
All roads lead to Rome, right?

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:26.430
So,

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:28.800
shouldn't we let the kids
go back to class first?

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.040
Right. You guys go to class now.

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:33.650
-Go back now.
-Go back.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.980
We went to all that trouble

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.260
for nothing in the end.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.360
Xiaoman, do you have any regrets?

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.910
No. Didn't you hear?

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:53.900
Even if my name were submitted,

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.810
I wouldn't have been selected.

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.380
It's okay. But after today, I realized

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:00.910
what matters most.

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:03.480
My friends matter most.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:04.690
No matter what happens,

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:06.890
my friends will always stand by my side.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.320
Just like what I read in that book.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.480
"Gold is like dirt

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:13.080
compared to priceless friends."

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.320
"Friends who are worth 1,000 gold."

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.460
That means "priceless," right?

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:16.990
Forget about gold and dirt.

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:18.990
Have you forgotten our poem?

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:20.690
"I am a kapok tree.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.250
As trees,

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:23.550
we stand together."

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:25.460
Okay.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:26.870
Xiaoman,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.280
give some thought

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:31.910
to the sports school
Director Hou mentioned.

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:32.750
Think it over.

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:35.550
They're back! There they come!

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.050
How did it go?

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:40.640
How did it go?

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:41.840
What did they say?

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:46.240
He didn't get selected.

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:49.080
It's okay, Xiaoman. Don't be discouraged.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.510
Whether it's
reading a self-criticism on stage or what,

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:53.100
you must count me in.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.280
Really, Meng Ge?

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:00.040
You're really willing
to share weal and woe with us?

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.470
Yes, of course! We are friends.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.270
I can't let you guys
steal all the spotlight.

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:04.960
Great.

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:06.550
Okay.

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:08.390
We are

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:09.910
not expelled.

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:13.510
Our punishment is to clean
the teaching building for a month.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:15.890
Good job, Yan Xiaodan.

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:17.070
I still have things to do. I'm leaving.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:18.120
Don't go, Meng Ge.

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:20.650
Didn't we agree to share weal and woe?

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:56.020
[Celebrate the Return of Hong Kong]

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:00.320
Why hasn't Sun Lulu

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.650
come to ask me about math problems lately?

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:06.770
She solved her problems herself.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:07.890
What do you mean?

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:11.840
Can't you tell

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:12.720
that she asked you questions

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.780
just to see Zhang Xiaoman every time?

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.360
Zhang Xiaoman, that fool,

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:18.960
delivered a letter for someone
without signing the sender's name,

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.960
which made Sun Lulu misunderstand.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.200
Now it's done for.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:24.080
Sun Lulu knows everything.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.280
So she's too embarrassed to come again.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.910
What? You don't believe me?

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:33.360
Xiaoman told me himself.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.910
Why would Xiaoman explain that to you?

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:36.790
Was it because

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.050
you got jealous?

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:40.600
Why would I get jealous?

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:41.140
I...

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.850
I just couldn't bear
to see that girl getting the wrong idea.

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:49.150
Fine.

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.110
It's best if you don't misunderstand.

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:55.310
A little more.

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:57.070
Move a little more.

00:15:58.050 --> 00:15:59.270
Look, a bit higher and a bit lower.

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:00.720
Let's work it out. Lower.

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:04.470
Right here! Nice!

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:05.770
Stay still.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:06.750
-Okay.
-It's here. Right here.

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:07.120
Okay.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:07.870
Keep it in this direction.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:08.810
Good. We have a signal.

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:09.240
Great.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:10.840
We have a signal.

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.720
There's a signal.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.790
Xiaoman! Where are you going?

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.510
Don't leave me alone here...

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:16.230
I...

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:18.980
Signal's connected.

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:22.270
You've started eating?

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:23.080
Red sausage!

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:24.550
We've got that thing here.

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:25.340
Looks delicious.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.320
The thing Dongdong brought from home.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.380
Chocolate... Chocolate champagne.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:31.030
Champagne? Alcohol?

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.430
I don't know. Chocolate.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:34.270
That should be a soft drink, I guess.

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:35.060
Dongdong!

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.550
Chocolate champagne.

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:37.810
Hurry up. I'll open it.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:38.960
Why didn't you wait for me?

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.420
Aren't we waiting for you?

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:43.690
-Open it. Let's drink.
-Open it!

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.220
Can your teeth really handle it?

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:46.320
You have your own "bottle opener."

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.320
There are cups! Come on, top them up.

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:49.960
Pour it. Smells pretty good.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.790
Let's substitute drinks for wine today.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:52.280
Cheers!

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.440
Come on. Cheers.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:54.550
Cheers!

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.260
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:02.160
I'll show you a magic trick.

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:02.990
What?

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:03.810
A magic trick.

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:04.480
Right here?

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:05.960
Just a second.

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:07.310
Where are you going?

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:09.109
He's going to do the magic trick.

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:11.020
These pickles are way too sour.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.160
Is this your magic trick?

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.130
You conjured this up?

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:17.109
Like a big bathtub.

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:18.109
Are you going to take a bath?

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:19.170
What are you doing?

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.000
A magic trick!

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:22.200
Come on. Come here.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.310
What is it?

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.170
I poured too much water. It's too heavy.

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:26.480
What?
Are you going to scrub someone's back?

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.140
Stand on it.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:30.480
Are you ready?

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.640
Behold.

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.550
Look.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:34.740
Watch closely.

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:40.970
Come on. Let's block the wind.

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:42.790
-Let's block the wind.
-We have to block it.

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:43.650
Block the wind.

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:45.910
Block it. Block the wind.

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:56.840
So high!

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:01.030
-This one is big! Amazing!
-This...

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:02.720
Does it look great inside?

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.350
It looks great! Especially from inside!

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:05.310
It's completely different.

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:06.830
So, what do you think?

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:07.550
Impressive.

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:09.510
Am I, Zhang Xiaoman, amazing?

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:12.200
Meng Ge. Meng Ge, you...

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:14.110
Why don't you try?

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.080
Go, go ahead.

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:28.510
Is it beautiful inside?

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:30.010
Yeah, it is.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:34.860
What's wrong? Don't you like it?

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:36.350
No.

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:38.390
It's too unreal.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.900
And I don't dare to like it.

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:43.640
It won't last at all.

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.010
But... But it's so beautiful.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.790
With your build,
I can't find the right angle.

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:48.510
What do you mean, Wang Dongdong?

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:49.960
No, no. I mean...

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.000
Get up!

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.750
Look at those two.

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:52.590
Stop talking!

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:55.150
Sometimes I quite envy them.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.620
They live in this soap bubble,

00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:00.170
never having seen the outside world.

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:01.720
They don't know

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:04.910
that the colorfulness of life is

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:07.470
just a reflection of the outside world.

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:12.030
But soap bubbles are easily broken.

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:16.280
Are you saying
our plant is like a soap bubble?

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.550
Our plant made this year's fireworks.

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:21.070
Did you know that?

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.070
My dad told me that.

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:25.810
But our plant
used to make smokeless powder.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.290
After switching
from military to civilian production,

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.020
what future do we have?

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.550
Why would you think about that?

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:39.750
Just tell me if you think
that moment was beautiful or not.

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:42.030
It was literally a flash in the pan.

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:43.430
Was it beautiful? Was it?

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:45.790
Was it great?

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.720
I can't say it wasn't.

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.400
See? A double negative makes a positive.

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:51.310
So it was beautiful.

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:53.270
Even if it's fleeting, it's beautiful.

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:54.310
Yeah, yeah, beautiful.

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:56.070
It's beautiful. Come on.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:58.550
Starting now,

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:01.400
we are broadcasting
this grand ceremony live.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.680
-Take it slow.
-Be careful, Lulu.

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:03.140
Come on.

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:04.510
Hong Kong's return is

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:07.780
the long-cherished call
in the hearts of Chinese people.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:09.640
Hong Kong's return is

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.400
the shared expectation
of all Chinese people.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.220
Let's go.

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:16.110
Over 150 years of this long journey,

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:19.310
over 150 years
of these unforgettable times.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:20.550
Today,

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:23.790
Hong Kong has finally returned
to the motherland's embrace.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:26.390
More than 6,000,000
Hong Kong compatriots are

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.360
finally free from colonial rule,

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:29.310
entering

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:31.350
a new era where they hold sway

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:32.750
over their own destiny.

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:39.590
It's returned.

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:40.240
Cheers.

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:42.270
-It's back! Welcome back!
-Cheers!

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.240
I'm out!

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.880
-Get a bottle.
-Pour it.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.480
Get a bottle. Here, Dongdong.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.400
-Come on.
-Thank you.

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:53.240
Fireworks!

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:56.240
Fireworks bloomed
in the sky for just an instant,

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.750
yet the plant's roar had lasted for years.

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:03.550
On a summer night in 1997,

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.640
dazzling fireworks

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.290
lit up half the sky over Western Tiecheng.

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:11.440
People looked up,

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.640
grinding the calluses on their palms,

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.680
through the countless days
and nights to come,

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.140
into longings and dreams,

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:20.450
into companionship and hope.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.010
Fireworks bloomed,

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.720
illuminating our youthful faces
time and time again.

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:29.190
We cheered with jubilation,

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:32.210
smiling as we embraced
the upcoming prosperity.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.880
We made wishes about our hometown,

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:35.880
about each other,

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.750
and about the future.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.880
But we never noticed
the gears of time were

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.880
already silently turning toward the bend.

00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:59.890
Come on, Mr. Li. This way, please.

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:01.200
Take a look, please.

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:05.640
You've opened
so many pool halls in Tiecheng.

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.440
You surely know the market well.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.410
And our asking price is really low.

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:11.880
You'll definitely make a profit
if you buy it.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.200
There are barely any customers here.

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:16.640
Well, it's not peak hours yet.

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:18.560
Once it is, it'll be packed.

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:19.670
Oh, right.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:21.720
Look at our cues.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:22.750
These are

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:24.350
a new batch we got 2 months ago,

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:25.350
of great quality.

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:28.070
And those lights on the wall.

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:29.110
You can check them out later

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:30.480
to see how good they are.

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:34.110
Okay. The equipment is good.

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:34.790
Right?

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:35.830
Later on,

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.720
tear down
those broken machines in the back.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.380
We can fit in a few more tables.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.480
And repaint the walls.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.480
This is way too old now.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.030
Okay, okay.

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:44.240
Once you take it over, you're the boss.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.110
You can do whatever you want.

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.440
Okay.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:46.530
Wait a minute.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:48.590
Mr. Li.

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.110
You might not have read this contract.

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:52.710
It's written very clearly here.

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:53.800
If you want to take over this place,

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.330
you can't make any changes.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.110
Look at you.

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:57.610
You didn't tell me

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.000
about this situation earlier!

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000
That's not what we mean.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.790
What's wrong? This is our plant.

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:03.640
We want to keep it as it was.

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:07.080
You think you can keep it
just because you want to?

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.360
Still living in the past?

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:12.030
Look at the reality, bro!

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.370
What do you mean?

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:15.040
I heard people saying

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:16.670
that people in your plant are

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:18.070
all leaving.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.480
I'm even worried

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:24.370
that no one will be playing
in the pool hall in a couple of days.

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:25.180
To be honest,

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:27.240
were it not for the low price you offered,

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.550
I wouldn't even take over this dump.

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:32.370
In this case, just don't take it.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.070
Right?

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.410
Hey, Wang Tieda.

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:38.750
Are you fooling me?

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:41.400
Why would I fool you?

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:44.030
I just don't want
to sell it anymore, okay?

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:45.880
The tools you use to make a living

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:47.970
have all turned into scrap metal!

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:50.240
And you're still acting tough with me?

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:53.500
You still think the East Chemical Plant
can be great again?

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:58.350
That's funny.

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:02.440
About what our factory has become,

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:04.590
is it up to you?

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:06.400
Or up to you?

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:07.210
Xiaoman...

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:08.720
Or up to you guys?

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:12.130
Exactly. Tiecheng has only been doing well
for a few years,

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:13.720
and you already dare to challenge us here.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.780
Have you forgotten

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.270
when you used to come here
to collect scrap?

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:19.920
Now you're looking down on us like a snob.

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.340
Who are you calling a snob?

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:23.930
It's you.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:25.590
Stop yelling here.

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:27.960
We haven't signed a contract.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.160
And you haven't paid.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.560
If you want to play this game,

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.830
I'll show you

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.640
how united our plant is.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.880
Fine, Wang Tieda.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.970
I'll remember you guys.

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.960
This isn't over.

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:49.320
Let's go.

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.200
See yourself out.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.400
W-Who does he think he is?

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.200
You don't want to sell it anymore?

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.660
I don't want to sell to him.

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:00.190
He scared the balls away.

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:00.700
Bro,

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:04.030
will we still sell this place
in the future?

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:06.010
Of course we will sell it.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.010
But I decide who I sell to.

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:42.640
Take a break.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.930
You need to balance study and rest,
don't you?

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.880
I'm doing a practice test.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:48.960
I'm timing myself.

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:50.590
Tell Mom

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.640
that I'm not eating
or drinking anything right now.

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.570
Let's talk about it after I'm done.

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.640
Okay.

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.290
Look, look at it.

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:08.440
Why are all your fish

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.480
so spiritless today?

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:11.000
Look.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.830
You need to pump some oxygen.

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:14.110
I'm buying this to keep my child healthy.

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:15.480
I can't let him get sick because of it.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:16.340
It's not fresh.

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:18.240
Miss, that's impossible.

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.640
You always buy fish here.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.970
When have I ever cheated you
with bad fish?

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:24.830
You must have
stocked up on pit-farmed fish.

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.130
The one I cooked last time

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:27.160
tasted so muddy.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:27.980
Look at this.

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:28.420
Wait.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.370
I'm feeding it to my child.

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:31.040
It has to be purely natural.

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.240
Look how lively this fish is.

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:34.890
Tong Guizhen,

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.710
are you done?

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:37.880
It's just eating fish.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:38.350
What?

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:39.440
In the whole East Chemical Plant,

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.610
is your son the only one
worthy of eating fish?

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:43.240
Hey, w-watch your mouth.

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:44.540
What does my son eating fish

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:46.350
have to do with you?

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.270
Besides,

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.440
my son will get a recommended admission
to Peking University.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.880
So what if he eats a good fish?

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.140
Is that too much to ask?

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:55.960
I remember

00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:58.720
the last time our plant
had a Peking University student was

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.920
when Halley's Comet visited Earth.

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:04.350
I'd like to see
what kind of spectacle will appear

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:06.010
in the sky this time next year.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.310
You are just jealous of my child.

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:10.400
But it's pointless.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.240
Listen,

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.030
Xia Lei will surely
pass the exam and study outside.

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:14.240
When he gets to the big city,

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.680
he can eat whatever he wants

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:16.880
from the sea or the lake.

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:17.590
Yeah, yeah.

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:19.160
Here, this one? Good.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.200
Look.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:21.830
Look at her mindset.

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.480
That's why they say

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.680
their family is "rich in spirit."

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.550
Who are you talking about?

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:27.880
What is "rich in spirit"?

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:28.400
It's about you.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.590
Why are your words so unpleasant?

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:30.640
-What do you mean?
-Who are you talking to?

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:31.880
What do you mean by "rich in spirit"?

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.070
Your family eats a fish,

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:34.200
and you just won't shut up about it.

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.640
You know what? Some people

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.940
just can't stand seeing others do well.

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:38.070
Forget about the fish!

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:39.800
Could you please stop arguing?

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.880
How about this?
You two pick whatever you want,

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:42.880
and I'll round down the price.

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:43.210
Okay?

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:43.880
Yeah, look.

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:45.200
-Right.
-Since he said so.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.030
I'm not eating.

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:46.480
Wait.

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:47.590
Eat it or not. I don't care.

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:48.590
What is wrong with her?

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:49.880
Use her discount for me.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:50.540
No problem.

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:55.290
T-This is quite fresh.

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:00.340
Dad, I'm home.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.520
Wash your hands. We'll eat soon.

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:05.590
Where's Mom?

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.010
She got into a fight.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:08.580
You two fought?

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:10.570
Nonsense. We didn't fight.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.000
Come here!

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:14.830
What's wrong?

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.610
She argued with someone
while buying groceries.

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:19.970
She didn't win?

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:21.240
I didn't hear that.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.170
What are you two whispering about?

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:24.480
The boy is hungry.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.550
He asked when we'd eat.

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:26.480
We'll eat soon.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.240
Xia Lei.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.480
Can you bring honor to me

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.110
and get the recommended admission?

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:34.070
How dare she call me
someone rich in spirit?

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.880
Screw them.

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:37.000
Come on. Make a promise to your mom.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:38.400
Mom, rest assured.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.610
I'll definitely do well on the exam

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:40.670
and make you proud.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:42.620
Time to eat!

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:44.060
Eat.

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.710
Here we go.

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:49.550
One two.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:52.710
Straight.

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:54.740
Rear straight.

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:56.550
One more time.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:58.010
One two.

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:00.590
One two.

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:02.080
One two.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:03.480
Good.

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:04.880
Left.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:05.960
Left.

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:07.640
Left hook.

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:09.690
Rear straight.

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:14.590
Don't you dare push it!

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:20.880
Come on. Let's keep going.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.140
It's fine. Ignore her.

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:29.130
Forget about her. Come on, hit me.

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:31.270
Straight punch. Use some force.

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:36.150
Hit.

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:39.070
Ignore her! Are you gonna hit or not?

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:44.850
Left.

00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:59.830
Practice by yourself for a bit.

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:04.600
-Are you done?
-Stay out of it.

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.550
Are you done?

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.010
Will you take me away or not?

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:11.790
How many times have I told you?

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:15.010
Why won't you take me away?

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.350
How many times have I repeated it to you?

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:18.400
I don't want you to mess around with me.

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.310
Nana's dad.

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.440
found a job for her in Shenyang,

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.440
but she doesn't want to go accept it.

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.040
She wants to go south with Da.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:25.790
But Da

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:27.660
wants her to keep the job

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.860
and wait until he's settled down.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:33.360
Isn't he just afraid
she'll suffer if she goes south with him?

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:38.870
But shouldn't people in love

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:40.200
stay together

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.530
no matter where they go?

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.190
That's true. You're right.

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:31.650
I'd like to emphasize the exam rules.

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.240
Don't cheat.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.800
If you cheat, you will be caught.

00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:37.640
Is that clear?

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.200
Understood.

00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:41.890
Pass them back.

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:47.560
Pass them on.

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:52.290
Pay attention. Only after the bell rings

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.920
can you start answering questions.

00:31:58.650 --> 00:31:59.580
The exam begins.

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:28.830
I'm back.

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:30.240
Sweetie is back.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.830
How was the exam?

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:35.440
It was okay.

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.640
As long as it's not math,

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:38.790
anything is fine.

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.240
Please, no more math exams.

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:44.450
By the way, Mom.

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:46.240
You know what?

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:50.000
Our proctor was so weird.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.330
Instead of proctoring,

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:53.980
he was hiding there reading about UFOs.

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.550
Your mom didn't ask about your teacher.

00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:56.790
She asked how you did on the exam.

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:57.830
I just said.

00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:58.750
It was okay.

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.000
Mock exams don't matter.

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.570
Your attitude is wrong.

What?

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.060
Let me tell you.

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:10.310
This mock exam is very important.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.240
It is a rehearsal for the Gaokao.

00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:16.200
Sweetie, your dad was a university student
of the class of 1961-1965.

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:18.200
You can't go wrong listening to him.

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:21.730
I want to discuss something with you.

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.140
I did pretty well on this exam.

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.170
And I can do well next time, too.

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:28.500
I can do well again.

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:29.070
If so,

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:32.670
can you let me go participate
in the host competition in Beijing?

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:34.350
Let go of me.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:35.830
Save it.

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:36.790
Get up.

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:37.620
I'm begging you.

S-Sit properly. Don't move.

Hey, at a time like this,

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.050
can you get your priorities straight?

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:48.240
How did I fail to prioritize?

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:48.830
I did!

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:50.230
The primary is studying.

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.550
As for the secondary,

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:52.590
I need to have hobbies, too!

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:54.920
I-I have dreams I want to pursue.

00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:55.790
Is that not allowed?

00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:57.240
I want to be a host!

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.070
Why can't I?

00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:59.200
Mom, say something!

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.690
What are you doing, old man?

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.030
You should encourage our Sweetie.

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:05.980
Work-life balance.

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:06.510
Exactly.

Go.

Okay, okay, I got it.

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.280
Go mind your own stuff.

00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:18.630
I promise I'll study hard.

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:21.190
Think about it another way.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.239
This might become a motivation.

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:25.090
Maybe I'll study even harder

00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:26.070
and better,

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:27.900

-That's enough.

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:39.480
I might consider it.

Really?

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:46.110
Forty-nine is okay, too?

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:47.920
Dad, how about around 50?

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:49.840
Give me some wiggle room.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.670
Fifty-five, fifty-four?

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:55.480
Does this count as your agreement?

00:34:55.929 --> 00:34:57.160
Dad, did you agree?

00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:58.970
I'll take that as a yes.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:00.880
I'm going to study hard then.

It's exactly Math that I'm worried about.

My math is already just average.

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:26.800
forced me to do more exercises.

Great.

Mr. Gu.

Xia Lei and Yan Xiaodan are
both good students.

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:21.440
Could there be a misunderstanding?

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:22.280
That's true.

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.270
If they weren't good students,

with such a cheating method.

There's a code on the scale.

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:46.510
Half a centimeter counts as one question.
