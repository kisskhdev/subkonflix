[Din]: Rose.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.260
Yes?

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.700
Please marry me.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.730
[Lom]: I’m the one who suggested that to her.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.900
This marriage will help keep you safe from Mr. Wasupol.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.900
I will marry you.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.700
[Din]: We also have to make it legal and sign a marriage certificate.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.220
[Rose]: I understand that we should make it look real both by law and in practice.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.460
[Nam]: We’ll help take care of the wedding arrangement.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.060
Thank you so much.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.340
For the security part, just leave it to me.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.700
And for the prewedding photoshoot, Fai will take care of it.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:59.729
Fine.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.980
But only because Nam asked me so.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.500
Din, have I done anything to upset Fai?

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.300
Fai mightn’t look so friendly but if you get to know her more, she’s actually a nice person.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.740
Sis, let’s do the prewedding photoshoot tomorrow. But it might look a bit dry in the background though.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.780
Then, should we do it at your farm instead? It’d look prettier there.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.500
Good idea. Can we do that, Rose?

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.100
Sure.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.800
Miss Din, Miss Din! Mr. Wasupol is here to see you.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.660
Is Wasu with him too?

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.060
No, Miss. Just Mr. Wasupol and two of his men. They’re waiting in their car now.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.140
How dare he show his face here. Come, Sis. I’ll go with you.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.500
I’ll go too. Wanna see his shameless face.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.780
No need. All of you just stay here. Please take care of Rose for me. I’ll go talk to him.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.200
I’m here to talk to you. Why did you force Rose to move in with you?

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.060
You must have misunderstood something. Rose is willing to stay here

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.100
What about your wedding with Rose? You’re taking advantage of her while Thipakorn is still in a coma.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:53.420
You’re well aware that my family and hers have long agreed that Rose should marry Wasu.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.180
No matter what, Rose has to marry Wasu.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.580
If only you’d taken pride in whatever you still have left of your family name, you wouldn’t have done this.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.980
It’s just your words, with no written agreement.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.780
I can also claim that before the accident, Uncle Thip told me to marry Rose.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.860
Don’t you think you’re going a bit too far?

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.019
Think about it, what if I tell everyone about this?

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.420
People might be talking that your parents haven't raised you well enough.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:22.700
That you have no shame.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.740
Neither have I then.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.860
Rose.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.800
Because I chose to marry her at my own will.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:45.460
I apologize for interrupting. But I have to protect the woman I want to marry.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:53.820
I don’t love Wasu, so I can’t keep my parents’ promise to marry him.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.300
And above all that, Uncle…

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.380
I love her.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.930
She’s the person I love and want to marry.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.860
You only came back not long ago, how on earth could you love her?

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.730
You still don’t know her well.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.540
And she’s also a girl like you.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.600
We’ve known each other since we were little.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.820
There might be times when we lost touch while I was still in the US.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:48.820
But my father has always kept me posted about her.
So, when we met again, we could feel the sparks pretty quickly.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.860
She is warm, kind, and very sweet.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.060
The next thing I knew, I’ve already fallen head over heels for her.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:08.220
Uncle, can you please not come between our love?

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.760
If you’re free, I'd like to invite you to our wedding too.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.100
Are you all right, Din?

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.100
Yes, I’m okay.

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.900
She’s probably still shocked after hearing you confessing your love to her.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.060
Well...

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:10.460
I only said that to make Mr. Wasupol believe Din and I are in love. Please don’t take it seriously.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.660
Thank you, Rose, for standing up for me.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.200
You did a great job there, Rose. Got him quite dumbfounded.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:26.130
But coming here to speak to you himself, I don’t think he would let it slide so easily.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.700
I’m not going to let anyone hurt you.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:35.330
Please promise me that you’ll be more careful from now on.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.740
Yes, I promise.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.060
Someone is getting flustered.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.260
Fine, I approve.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:02.860
I approve of your marriage with Rose. And I also accept her as one of our family…

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:06.380
and will no longer be against her too.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.100
Thanks a lot for understanding me, Fai.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.260
I really don’t trust that smile.

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:21.380
Like we could ever trust this rascal.

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.059
What are you doing, Boss?

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.340
Yes? Did you just call me?

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:41.940
It’s only you and me here, Boss.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:44.860
B…Boss?

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.860
Yes. Boss.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:55.580
Why are you calling me Boss? I’m younger than you.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:59.940
I don’t care if you’re younger or older. As long as you’re cool, I’ll call you Boss.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.380
Are you bothering her since early morning?

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.260
Of course, not. I was just saying hi to Boss Rose.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.460
Please don’t mind her. She’s quite nuts.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.900
Geez, first thing in the morning.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.300
Where’s Din?

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.330
She’s left since dawn to drop Nam off. She should be back soon.

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.980
Oh, Nam has gone home?

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.820
Yes, urgent work came up.

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.600
That one is busier than a superstar.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.540
Are you guys having breakfast?

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.060
You’re back? Took you long enough.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.300
Can I eat now?

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.740
Go ahead.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:47.600
All right then, let’s hurry and finish your breakfast so we can start shooting for the prewedding before the sun gets too strong.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.300
Have you got your outfits ready, Boss?

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.600
Yes, I have them all ready.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.300
What? Boss?

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:28.780
Okay, like this. Whose sister is this? So good-looking.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.780
Okay, ready?

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:39.560
Can you two move a little closer to her? We don’t need social distancing now.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:41.930
Like this?

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.580
Seriously, that little? Closer please.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:55.700
Wow, so close I’d need a microscope to see it. Lom!

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.940
Put your arm around her waist. Don’t just stand there like a log.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.180
Give her some respect.

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:14.540
It’s all right. I don’t mind at all. So that our photos will look pretty.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.980
Hug me a little tighter.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.660
Smile, sis. Or else they’d think you’re not married for real.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.960
Can you stop bossing me around?

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:32.860
Smile!

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.360
Please smile.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.420
Or else people mightn’t believe we’re married for real.

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:45.700
Smile like this.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.980
Smile like someone who’s in love. Like this.

Hello, sir. This way, please.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:25.060
We’ve prepared a seat for you. Please let us know if you need anything.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.460
Over here, please.

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:31.160
Food and drinks are available over there.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:31.900
Yes.

In case you’d like to have your meal here, please feel free.

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:36.660
Yes.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:51.730
I already told our men to keep watch at the entrance.
Some of us are also disguised as guests.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:53.820
Good. If there’s anything, tell me immediately.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:54.700
Yes, sir.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.300
Excuse me, can I take your picture, please?

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:28.420
Give these two glasses of wine to the governor and his wife.

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.460
Also ask them if they need anything.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.340
It’s so lovely.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.180
Do you like it?

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.780
Yes.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:15:00.780
Without Nam, Lom, and Fai; it wouldn’t have happened at all.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.420
I don’t think I can manage all this alone.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:07.300
I should go and thank everyone after this.

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:10.100
They are willing to do it for us.

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:12.530
But I still feel bad.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.100
I already told you that we’re a family now.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:20.940
Yes?

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:28.740
From now on, Amornjinda will never have to walk alone. They’ll always have Watinwanich by their side.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.060
Thank you so much.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:42.220
Even though this is just a fake marriage, I do feel safe with you here.

00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:01.380
Miss Din, Miss Rose, Mr. Wasu is causing a ruckus at the entrance.

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:08.600
I said you can’t go in.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.530
Why the hell can’t I?

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:12.360
You’re not invited.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.780
Did that bastard tell you so?

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:16.930
What are you doing here?

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:21.500
Loser, did you tell your men to take care of your guests like this?

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.820
Wasu, please don’t cause any problem here.

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.580
That’s not why I’m here, Rose.

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:30.540
I’m here on behalf of my father.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.140
Didn't you invite him yourself?

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.400
Fine, go in.

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:54.160
Let's go.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:11.940
1 2 3! That’s it. Thank you.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.859
Rose, come and take a picture with me.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.180
Hey, mug face. Take us a picture.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:38.180
Son of a bitch.

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:39.020

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:43.820
Just you wait.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.000
Give me your best smile.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.780
Done. Off you go.

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:01.260
You look so beautiful today.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:06.940
Rose, can you please go talk to the governor for me? I saw him looking our way.

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:08.500
Sure.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.160
Do you really think having the governor here could save your fucking ass from me?

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:20.980
You can try it if you want.

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:25.380
But there’s one thing I’m sure of--you’ll definitely lose more than you’d gain.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.340
I don’t care. I’ll do anything to make Rose mine.

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:37.140
She’s not yours. And she has never been one.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:44.820
Mark my words, from now on, Rose is my wife. Don’t you ever forget that.

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:45.740
- You!
- Mr. Wasu.

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:46.900
Remember what your father said.

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:54.860
You’ll never die in peace, Bastard!

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.400
It’s time to exchange rings, Sis.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:44.620
Din, this is not the ring I’ve chosen.

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:48.140
I told Nam to get a new one for you.

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.660
You're the most valuable thing in my life.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.940
That’s why I want you to have the best of everything.

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:29.100
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:33.980
What to do now? Everyone’s looking at us.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.060
Just ignore them.

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:45.530
But other guests might not believe it then.

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.380
What should we do then?

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:55.860
How about a cheek-to-cheek kiss?

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:00.500
Okay.

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:29.220
Rose.

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:29.940
Yes?

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.980
I…I…

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.500
Din!

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:35.260
Din!

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:36.940
Miss Din fainted! She fainted!

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:37.780
Miss Din!

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.260
Sis!

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.660
Miss Din fainted!

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:48.460
Please don’t die, Sis!

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:49.380
Miss Din!

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:51.140
- Sis!
- Miss Din!

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:52.140
Sis!

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:54.300
Miss Din!

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:55.260
My dear sis.

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:56.340
Are you really having it that bad?

00:24:55.620 --> 00:25:00.180
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:25.000
May I…come in?

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.020
Of course. It’s your room.

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:39.960
Are you feeling better?

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:45.100
Yes.

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:53.900
I see you haven’t showered yet. Aren’t you feeling a bit sticky right now?

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:59.420
I just got up. I’m about to go shower.

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.100
Why are you packing?

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:39.000
I’m going to sleep with Fai in the guest bedroom.

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:40.730
So that you can rest freely here.

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:46.940
Please don’t. I can go sleep in my room.

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:49.540
This way, you won’t have to bother Fai too.

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:53.980
No, you can’t. If Aunt Chan and Moddang find out,

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:56.780
they might think it suspicious why newlyweds like us are sleeping in separate rooms.

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:58.300
You’re right.

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:08.380
Just sleep here. I’ll sneak out and make sure no one sees me.

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:10.540
Okay.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.620
I’m going then.

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:20.260
Miss Din! What are you doing? Isn’t it already past the time for the bridal bed ceremony?

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:32.060
I just want to make sure everything in the guest room is all right, in case Fai might need anything.

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:35.380
Oh, that’s nothing at all. You can leave it to me.

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:38.380
Please go back into your room, Miss.

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:43.140
Don’t you know it’s a jinx to leave your room on your wedding night?

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:48.700
You shouldn’t come out until the next morning. Okay?

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:51.100
N…next morning?

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:52.800
Yes.

00:28:56.100 --> 00:29:00.020
I’ll leave it to you then.

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.380
Don’t worry. Let me take care of it.

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:08.020
Please go back inside, my dear miss. And don’t come out no matter what. Don’t open the door even if you hear anything.

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:13.340
Stay inside with your wife until the next morning. Our ancestors are really serious about this, Miss.

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:15.400
Good night.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.530
I guess you're stuck with me tonight.

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:45.460
We’d better go shower. It’s late.

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.460
You mean together?

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:55.960
I mean after you’re done showering, I’ll shower too.

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:03.160
Or…do you want to get in the bath together?

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:07.600
N…No.

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:13.780
Make it quick.

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:34.380
Din.

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:36.660
What are you doing?

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:40.900
Oh, just praying before going to bed.

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:44.400
I mean why are you sleeping on the floor?

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:47.600
I’ll sleep here tonight.

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.930
You can take the bed. It’s comfier.

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:51.700
You can’t do that!

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.700
I already feel guilty enough for taking up space in your room like this.

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:57.340
Let’s sleep together.

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:00.260
Sleep together?

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:04.700
I don’t think it’s appropriate.

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:06.700
But if you’re going to sleep on the floor,

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:09.260
I don’t think it’s appropriate either.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.260
Why not?

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:14.900
First,

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.900
this is your room.

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:18.620
Second,

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.300
you must be exhausted after a long day.

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:22.860
Third,

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:27.020
you’re older than me. I can’t sleep on a higher ground than you.

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:35.060
Oh.

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:37.760
But I’m comfortable like this.

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:38.730
But I’m not!

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:39.780
I can sleep here!

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:40.420
No, you can’t!

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.180
Yes, I can!

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.460
No, you can’t! Oh!

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:09.220
If it really makes you feel awkward,

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:17.380
should we just…stay up all night then?

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:21.340
How about we…

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:25.900
stay up all night to tighten our relationship?

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:34.860
Tighten our relationship…all night?

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:38.500
How?

00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:00.660
So…

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:04.860
What should we talk about?

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:15.330
How about your life when you studied in the US?

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:23.160
I’m more interested in how you began to look after Saen Rak farm.

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:32.800
I’m all ears.

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:38.900
W…well…

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:42.020
At first,

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:48.580
looking after the whole farm was really hard for me.

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.580
But right now, even though it’s still tough,

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:53.740
I’m really happy.

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:58.500
That I’m able to carry on with what my father had done and even make it better.

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:05.100
And that’s my story. Now, it’s your…

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:14.700
Good night, Rose.

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.980
Aunt Chan, is Rose up yet?

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:27.300
Yes.

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:30.860
Rose.

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:32.580
You’re up?

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:37.500
You do all the cooking yourself today?

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:41.960
Isn’t it usually Aunt Chan’s job?

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.100
I just…want to do something special for our first morning after the marriage.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.700
Whoever gets to be your wife is absolutely lucky.

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:57.620
You take such amazing care of her.

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:08.020
Actually, I planned to serve you breakfast in bed.

00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:11.260
But you got up first.

00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:12.660
Then,

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:15.900
maybe I should go back to sleep.

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:18.300
So that you can serve me breakfast in bed!

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:19.380
Are you serious?

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.460
Just kidding.

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:31.000
Why don’t you go shower first then?

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:37.420
Give me 20 minutes. I’ll dress up nicely and have breakfast with you.

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:39.400
Okay.

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:01.020
Wow! Looks yummy!

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:03.580
Did you get up early to make all this?

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:04.760
Hey, don’t!

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:07.060
It’s for Rose.

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:10.180
Go tell Aunt Chan if you want to eat anything.

00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:12.700
I see. They’re for Rose.

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:16.460
- It’s a lot. She won’t be able to finish them.
- Hey, I said no!

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:18.500
- What if it’s not enough?
- So hungry!

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.140
Hey! Don’t!

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:24.060
These are all for Rose. Don’t touch them.

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:26.700
Fai.

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:27.460
Hm?

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.130
I think our sister is getting confused about what's real and what's not.

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.980
Look, she even got up so early to cook for the bride.

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:36.620
Aren’t you getting too carried away?

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:41.060
Now, I’m starting to doubt if this is a fake marriage or not.

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:43.340
Right?

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:44.500
Hey!

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:45.380
Don’t!

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.060
I told you, didn’t I?

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:00.300
That you shouldn’t go cause a ruckus at their wedding.

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:05.730
I just went there to congratulate them.

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:12.200
You think I don’t know you well enough?

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:14.160
You just don’t want to lose to Din.

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:20.180
That bastard stole Rose from me, Dad!

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:22.400
I don’t believe one bit that Rose loves her.

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:24.860
There’s no way they’re married for real.

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:30.980
If that’s what you believe,

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:33.660
I’ll prove it to you.

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:37.140
What are you going to do?

00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:50.700
Are they fresh?

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:55.600
Mr. Boat.

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:56.660
Mr. Wasupol.

00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:57.600
I’d like you to try this.

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:02.260
It’s our latest one. Please try, you can order from us next time if you like it.

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:03.860
Thank you.

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:13.730
Here you go.

00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:14.530
Yes?

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:16.900
Don’t worry. I already gave you a discount.

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:18.860
Thank you so much.

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:23.220
How is Wasu?

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:24.620
Has he eaten anything yet?

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:26.620
He’s still not better, sir.

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:30.300
Is Mr. Wasu all right?

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.400
I actually wanted to ask you earlier.

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:34.660
Usually, Mr. Wasu would take care of this job himself.

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:37.000
But today, you’re here instead.

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:41.220
Mr. Wasu is heartbroken because Miss Din snatched Miss Rose from him and married her.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.500
He hasn’t been able to eat or sleep for many days now.

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:45.300
Snatched?

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:47.560
What happened, Mr. Wasupol?

00:42:56.420 --> 00:43:00.380
Actually, the parents from our farm and Chomchan farm…

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:03.420
have long agreed on the engagement between Rose and Wasu.

00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:07.730
Wasu has loved his Rose since very little.

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:12.300
So, he’s now devastated and still can’t get over it.

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.860
Why would Miss Din do that?

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:18.960
Yeah, why?

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:25.260
I don’t know too. But I’m afraid there might be another reason behind this marriage.

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:30.060
A reason behind this? What reason?

00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:38.540
Bee! Bee!

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:44.300
Do you know that Miss Din married Miss Rose because she actually wanted to take over Chomchan farm and claimed it hers?

00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:44.780
What?

00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:49.300
I knew it! That’s why they got married out of the blue like that.

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:52.780
But Miss Rose just came back not long ago. When did they fall in love?

00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:55.760
I heard they’ve liked each other since young.

00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:58.260
That’s not all, Bee.

00:43:58.530 --> 00:43:59.330
What else?

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:02.060
You’d better zip it up and don’t tell anyone.

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:06.500
Listen, Mr. Wasupol and Miss Rose’s parents…

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:09.980
have long agreed to have Miss Rose engaged to Mr. Wasu.

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:15.180
What? This means Miss Din stole Miss Rose from him then.

00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:17.180
She’s so shameless.

00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:21.660
Everyone in the market knows that Miss Din and Miss Rose are not married for real.

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:25.060
It’s purely a marriage of convenience.

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:25.700
Seller.

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:26.600
Yes?

00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:49.340
Have a safe trip. Thanks a lot.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.020
My pleasure.

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:54.060
Please take Boss Rose to visit me in Surat sometimes.

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:58.140
I’ll call you later about the case.

00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:00.300
Okay. Thanks a lot for coming.

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:03.380
Take care of yourself.

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:06.400
Bye Bye!

00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:07.460
- Let’s go.
- [Fai]: Bye Bye.

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:09.580
- See you.
- [Rose]: Bye Bye! See you.

00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:10.730
Let’s go, Fai.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:11.800
Let's go.

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:13.530
See you again.

00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:14.200
Have a safe trip.

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:15.000
See you.

00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:36.160
Miss Din, Miss Rose! We’ve got problems!

00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:43.860
Miss Din, Miss Rose. We’ve got problems!

00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:44.730
What is it?

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:47.660
People in the market are talking about your marriage.

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:49.960
What are they saying?

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:53.560
They’re saying that you two got married for mutual benefits.

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:57.130
Some even say Miss Din is planning to take over Chomchan farm.

00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:01.460
You two are so madly in love, how could that be possible?

00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:05.000
What else did they say? Tell me everything.

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.130
There’s no doubt who started this rumour.

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:12.560
He obviously wants to ruin your reputation.

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:15.530
Wasu must really hate me for taking you away from him.

00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:21.500
If they can spread the rumour,

00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:24.600
we can find a way to stop it too.

00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:29.100
What are you going to do?

00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:46.960
Hey. So, are Miss Din and Miss Rose actually lovers?

00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:51.220
I don’t know too. But I also find it suspicious.

00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:54.860
They suddenly got married without any sign or warning.

00:46:56.060 --> 00:47:00.180
Nonsense. Miss Din has always taken care of Miss Rose.

00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:05.420
When Miss Rose first came back from the US, Miss Din even sent some of our men to keep watch over her.

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:08.860
Do you know anything about it, Kaew?

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:15.340
No idea too. It’s probably just a rumour after all.

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:17.740
Look at that. There she is.

00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:22.140
Din!

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:23.800
Rose.

00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:32.400
What are you doing here, Rose?

00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:36.260
They are watching us.

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:40.700
I made you some snacks.

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:43.060
Are you tired?

00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:44.760
Not at all.

00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:46.860
Thank you.

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:48.460
Let me wipe off your sweat.

00:47:55.860 --> 00:48:00.460
They look pretty much in love to me. Seeing is believing indeed.

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:03.740
Yeah, people just like to gossip.

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:09.420
Thank you.

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:14.000
Do you want to eat them now?

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:17.460
Maybe later.

00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:30.020
Let me know if you want to eat anything.

00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:33.330
Hmm…what should I eat?

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:34.900
Guava maybe?

00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:36.100
Guava?

00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:37.100
Wait.

00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:37.700
Yes?

00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:38.500
Just a second.

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:42.860
Let me fix your hair a bit.

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:50.420
Have you finished your juice? You can have mine.

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.220
I guess the rumour wasn't true then.

00:49:02.730 --> 00:49:04.560
They look so madly in love.

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:07.900
I heard they went to sign a marriage certificate this morning.

00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:11.700
That’s why. Look how Miss Din is looking at her.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.140
Even my hubby has never looked at me that way.

00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:17.820
So, it’s not true then.

00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:20.020
- They're clearly in love.
- Yeah.

00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:22.380
Who on earth said she plans to take over Chomchan farm?

00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:26.660
Oh, the coconut juice again.

00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:27.700
Can I have one more?

00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:28.860
Sure, from this shop?

00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:30.620
Yes, oh!

00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:32.260
Rose!

00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:38.780
Does it hurt?

00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:43.540
Yes, my wrist too.

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:44.900
Can you stand up?

00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:50.180
1 2 3.

00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:51.540
Ouch!

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:55.900
I don’t think you can walk now.

00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:00.780
Get on my back then.

00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:02.620
What?

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:16.260
I can’t believe you’re now strong enough to carry me.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.900
Yeah. Back then, I could only stand there and watch Wasu giving you a piggyback ride.

00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:54.330
But with your foot hurt like this, will you be able to go on our honeymoon?

00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:57.130
Hm? What honeymoon?

00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:01.820
Lom suggested that we should go on a honeymoon.

00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:04.820
To make our marriage look even more believable.

00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:08.700
So, where will we go?

00:51:12.330 --> 00:51:13.660
Come on, please tell me a bit.

00:51:14.330 --> 00:51:16.700
Nope. I’ll make it a surprise for you.

00:51:17.130 --> 00:51:17.930
Please, Din.

00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:22.260
1 2 3. So cute.

00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:23.660
1 2 3.

00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:25.930
Thank you.

00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:29.660
Sis.

00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:31.140
Hey.

00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:31.980
Hi, Rose.

00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:34.900
Here’s your keys.

00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:36.560
Thanks.

00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:40.140
You must be exhausted after a long drive. Please rest well.

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:42.940
Thank you so much, Nam.

00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:45.980
Your resort is absolutely stunning.

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:47.140
Thank you.

00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:49.780
If you need anything, you can always tell our staff, Sis.

00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:53.260
Go on and get back to work. Don’t worry about us.

00:51:56.530 --> 00:52:00.200
Okay. I’ll get back to work then.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.530
Hope you and Rose will have a pleasant time here.

00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:15.860
She seems busy all the time, Din.

00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:18.560
Well, she’s a hotel heiress.

00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:22.460
Lom often tells me that Nam will probably end up marrying her work.

00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:26.020
But I think she’s amazing.

00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:30.020
She arranged everything for our wedding and made it incredibly wonderful.

00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:33.660
That’s because she’s the genius in our family.

00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:36.860
If she has her mind set on anything, there’s never a time she fails to succeed.

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:39.100
Cheers!

00:52:42.130 --> 00:52:45.560
Din and Rose are here now. I just gave them the room key.

00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:50.330
So, about our plan. Has it gone well?

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:55.960
Don’t worry. With that room I’ve arranged for them, they’ll definitely get to share a romantic moment there.

00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:00.530
Okay. Bye.

00:53:18.730 --> 00:53:20.460
Din! Din!

00:53:21.130 --> 00:53:22.400
Come see the bathroom.

00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:30.060
What is it, Rose?

00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:35.860
There’s no door. And you can see through these curtains. How are we going to shower then?

00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:41.660
Maybe Nam misunderstood and wanted us to have a real honeymoon. Look.

00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:54.620
I guess we have to take turns to use the bathroom.

00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:57.820
You can shower first. I’ll go wait on the veranda.

00:53:58.260 --> 00:53:59.060
Okay.

00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:12.530
Geez, Nam. What kind of joke is this?

00:54:36.130 --> 00:54:38.100
Why are they all like this?

00:54:42.130 --> 00:54:42.940
Moddang.

00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:43.460
Yes, Miss?

00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:46.780
Make sure you pack modest pjs for me. I have to be considerate of her.

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:50.700
You’re going on a honeymoon. Why would you bring modest pjs, Miss?

00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:53.660
You should be wearing one that’s sexy and revealing like this.

00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:55.930
Moddang.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:01.730
All right. I’ll pack the most modest pjs there is for you, Miss.

00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:10.180
Moddang!

00:55:23.730 --> 00:55:28.260
They’re gifts from me, Miss. I bought them especially for you.

00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:47.500
Rose.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:48.800
Yes?

00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:51.260
Are you okay?

00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:55.400
Is the air-con not cold enough?

00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:57.600
Oh!

00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:07.330
It’s just…Moddang has packed only this kind of pjs for me.

00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:10.930
So, I don’t have anything else to wear.

00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:13.580
That’s all right.

00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:15.900
We’re both girls. I don’t mind at all.

00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:21.780
Then, you should hurry and shower. So that you can rest.

00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:24.100
You drove all the way here today.

00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:26.740
I’ll…go shower then.

00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:27.780
Yes,

00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:47.580
Last time when I slept in your room,

00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:50.900
did I snore or sleeptalk?

00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:55.930
Not at all. You slept like a baby.

00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:04.500
Then, should we stay up all night again?

00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:06.860
We haven’t finished talking last time.

00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:09.100
Oh!

00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:12.060
Well…I…

00:57:12.730 --> 00:57:14.300
I…

00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:16.330
I was afraid you might get cold.

00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:17.760
I know.

00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:21.730
So, do you want to do it again?

00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:27.660
Up to you then. I’ll let you decide.

00:57:28.530 --> 00:57:29.800
Up to me again.

00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:33.160
We’re going to be together for quite some time.

00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:39.500
If you always let me decide, you might end up feeling agitated later on.

00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:44.860
Your happiness is also my happiness.

00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:49.100
Let’s sleep then.

00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:51.060
Good night.

00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:53.460
Good night.

00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:02.620

00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:07.700

[Next Episode]
[Rose]: Thank you, Miss Kaew.

00:58:38.530 --> 00:58:40.200
Do you want me to help carry her inside?

00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:42.330
Leave that to the wife to handle it.

00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:45.160
[Rose]: Are you going to Chiang Mai tomorrow with Miss Kaew again?

00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:47.760
I’ll go to Chiang Mai with you.

00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:50.180
Who do you have here, Miss Din?

00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:51.900
She’s not Miss Kaew, isn’t she?

00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:54.340
- This is Rose, my… #N - Din!

00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:55.360
Gun.

00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:58.580
[Gun]: I’ve always thought Din would fall for Miss Kaew.

00:58:59.130 --> 00:59:02.340
She always comes here with her.

00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:06.500
[Din]: I thought you’re only possessive of me whenever I’m with Kaew.

00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:10.360
But today, it seems you’re also jealous when I’m with Gun.

00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:12.100
[Lom]: She’s definitely jealous.

00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:13.820
What should I do then?

00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:16.220
Just do as I say.

00:59:31.060 --> 00:59:34.860
♫ Your touch burns a flame so bright,♫

00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:38.220
