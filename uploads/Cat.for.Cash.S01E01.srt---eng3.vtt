WEBVTT

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.760
Hey!

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.600
I know you're in there.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.152
Are you going to open the door or not?

00:00:46.176 --> 00:00:47.176
If not…

00:00:52.576 --> 00:00:55.976
Ti… Tiger, please don't hurt me.

00:00:56.008 --> 00:00:57.384
My kid just started school.

00:00:57.408 --> 00:00:58.968
I can't come up with the money in time.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.112
You can't come up with the money,

00:01:13.128 --> 00:01:14.624
or you can't stop spinning the slots? Huh?

00:01:14.648 --> 00:01:15.900
I'm really sorry.

00:01:15.928 --> 00:01:17.192
Please don't hurt me.

00:01:17.224 --> 00:01:19.190
I'll do anything you want.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.856
I'm sorry. I really am.

00:01:21.888 --> 00:01:22.488
I'm sorry.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.200
I'm sorry, bro.

00:01:23.232 --> 00:01:24.928
I'm really sorry. Please don't hurt me.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.088
I'm sorry. I beg you.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.176
I'm sorry.

00:01:29.216 --> 00:01:30.216
Argh!

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.992
If you don't pay me by tomorrow,

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.200
you'll end up like this phone.

00:01:55.144 --> 00:01:56.144
Understood.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.640
This is the last stop.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.440
Boss said this one's the toughest.

00:02:02.888 --> 00:02:03.816
I don't know why.

00:02:03.856 --> 00:02:05.728
Anyone who walks in here goes soft

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.240
and never comes back with the payoff.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.144
Well, well, well.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.640
They've got money to open a cat café,

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.016
but they can't pay off their debt.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.280
What's wrong with them?

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.600
Hey, Dong.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:50.720
You can go back first.

00:02:50.752 --> 00:02:51.752
What?

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.680
I'll take care of this case.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.248
You can hold him.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.072
Go ahead.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.216
You can hold any of my cats here.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.470
Just don't take them home.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.060
Well, I…

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.272
I'm allergic to cat fur.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.800
Oh, really?

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.130
But you're okay just
looking at them, right?

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.184
Jiro,

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.912
keep your distance.

00:03:33.936 --> 00:03:35.216
Social dis-cat-ing, dear.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.688
There he goes.

00:03:49.088 --> 00:03:50.088
Well…

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.816
actually, I'm here for...

00:03:50.848 --> 00:03:52.820
Are you here for a cat fix?

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.968
You must take off your shoes first.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.680
Welcome.

00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:12.400
Every cat here is a stray
that was abandoned.

00:04:12.424 --> 00:04:15.352
Cats are like people, you know?

00:04:15.368 --> 00:04:16.888
Even if they're the same breed,

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.440
they all have different personalities.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.248
(Most of them like being alone, though.)

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.250
(Cats like things neat and orderly.)

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.536
(Looking good is their top priority.)

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.168
(People usually think
cats don't understand us, )

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.944
(but they actually understand
everything we say.)

00:04:54.968 --> 00:04:56.936
(It's totally up to them
whether they feel like responding.)

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.976
I feel truly honored to visit Thailand.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.784
I love the racetracks here,
Thai food, and Thai massages.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.744
But what I love most is…

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.136
the Thai smile.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.648
My work here is done.

00:05:22.672 --> 00:05:26.624
You can freely enjoy
the party, Mr. Enrique.

00:05:26.648 --> 00:05:27.984
Have fun.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.224
Aren't you coming with me?

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.328
I still want to talk to you.

00:05:37.384 --> 00:05:40.280
(When you talk to cats,
you need to listen with your eyes.)

00:05:40.312 --> 00:05:43.112
(They respond to us
through their body language.)

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.304
(If cats get angry,
they flick their tails.)

00:05:46.328 --> 00:05:49.064
(You'd better run,
or they might scratch you.)

00:05:49.088 --> 00:05:50.888
Do you want to add a
cat to your friend list?

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.120
Huh?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.952
Make eye contact and blink slowly.

00:05:55.976 --> 00:05:58.576
If they blink back, it means
they've accepted your friend request.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.488
Or if you want to go
somewhere else with me,

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.080
I'm fine with that too.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.248
How about coming to my room?

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.152
My partner, who's an
F1 fan, is waiting for me.

00:06:20.176 --> 00:06:23.688
I'm sure you'll spend
the whole night talking together.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.232
Looks like his friend list is full.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.580
It's alright.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.256
I'll go find you a new boss.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.504
HOPE YOU FIND YOUR FAVORITE CAT.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.456
I've got plenty of cat bosses for you
to choose from.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.480
Come here.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.376
Go ahead, make your pick.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.144
Which boss do you like?

00:07:00.168 --> 00:07:03.384
JUMBO, JIRO, JENNIE

00:07:11.072 --> 00:07:14.416
LYNX.

00:07:18.368 --> 00:07:20.370
That one is named Lynx. He's my son.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.672
He ran off and became a stray.

00:07:22.712 --> 00:07:24.000
He's a tough nut to crack.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.384
If anyone can make him blink back,

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.728
I'm ready to give him up,

00:07:27.768 --> 00:07:28.928
along with this café.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.224
LYNX.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.700
"Cat for Cash" (Episode 1)

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.784
Je Meow, your ice is here.

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:52.408
Close the door for me, Krapor.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.304
The cats might sneak out.

00:08:53.328 --> 00:08:54.112
Oops, I forgot.

00:08:54.136 --> 00:08:55.136
I knew it.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.856
This cold guy is yours.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.048
My whole arm's already numb.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.040
Then hurry up and fill it.

00:09:04.072 --> 00:09:04.512
So cold.

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:06.510
Always with an intro.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.024
You're such a punctual guy.

00:09:09.048 --> 00:09:10.800
No wonder Jennie loves you so much.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:13.800
Sadhu.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.760
I've spent a fortune on her cat treats.

00:09:15.784 --> 00:09:17.568
Still, she won't even let me hold her paws.

00:09:17.608 --> 00:09:19.570
That's why that song was written,

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.664
♪ I shed my tears at a cat café ♪

00:09:23.136 --> 00:09:24.080
Don't give up just yet.

00:09:24.104 --> 00:09:24.752
Why, Sis?

00:09:24.768 --> 00:09:25.824
Just wait and see this man.

00:09:25.848 --> 00:09:26.848
Who?

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:28.700
Here he is.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.000
5

00:09:30.032 --> 00:09:31.128

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:40.640
Welcome to Cat-Cheer Café.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.288
Jiro.

00:09:43.312 --> 00:09:43.976
Jiro, my boy.

00:09:44.008 --> 00:09:45.688
I've got to respect Tiger's dedication.

00:09:45.728 --> 00:09:48.064
He's been here, same time, same place,
every day for three months.

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:50.608
Jiro still hasn't blinked back at him.

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.848
At first, he was like a sugar cat daddy.

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:54.896
Jiro.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.248
When treats didn't work,

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.048
he spoiled him with gadgets instead.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.632
But lately, he's been
coming in empty-handed.

00:10:07.656 --> 00:10:09.768
He's probably given up.

00:10:09.792 --> 00:10:11.088
Said who?

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.312
He's been wearing the same old shirt
for like a month.

00:10:13.336 --> 00:10:13.824
Huh?

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:18.288
He must've heard
cats recognize people by scent.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.608
Let's see if he finally gets recognized.

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:26.850
Jiro.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:31.840
Jiro.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:33.624
Let's be friends.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.380
Yes!

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:46.766
Jiro finally accepted his friend request.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:47.790
Let's go over there.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:50.120
Yes!

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.240
That was amazing, Tiger.

00:10:52.304 --> 00:10:54.696
Jiro finally accepted your friend request.

00:10:55.048 --> 00:10:56.048
Hey, Je Meow.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.608
This isn't Jiro.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.260
Huh?

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.744
They look really similar,

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.144
but Jiro has bigger eyes

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:09.760
and chubbier cheeks.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.624
Come on, no drama.

00:11:13.648 --> 00:11:15.200
I'm just messing with you.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.096
You're good, though.

00:11:16.128 --> 00:11:17.248
You remembered Jiro.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.608
This is another orange cat
someone's letting me look after for now.

00:11:19.632 --> 00:11:21.304
So I rotated him in with Jiro.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:26.168
Here you go.

00:11:26.192 --> 00:11:27.632
There he is.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.024
Your Jiro.

00:11:30.048 --> 00:11:30.824
Jiro.

00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:33.020
Tiger's here.

00:11:33.056 --> 00:11:34.280
Tiger could remember you.

00:11:34.312 --> 00:11:35.552
Give him a reward.

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:49.984
This is the real Jiro,
with the verified blue checkmark.

00:11:50.008 --> 00:11:51.216
Congrats.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:53.740
Je Meow.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.000
Can I take a picture of Jiro
for my phone wallpaper?

00:11:57.032 --> 00:11:58.032
Sure. Go ahead.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.968
How about I take it for you?

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:07.480
Make sure Jiro looks handsome.

00:12:08.968 --> 00:12:10.312
Nice.

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:18.832
(Our condo doesn't allow cats,
in case someone here didn't know.)

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.216
What's up?

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.976
(Hey, Lynx. We're all here.
(Where the hell are you?)

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:29.944
On my way.

00:12:29.984 --> 00:12:33.640
(Be real. Aren't you still at home
and standing us up?)

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:36.024
Good. If you already know, I'm hanging up.

00:12:36.048 --> 00:12:40.552
(Hold on. Remember telling me
you were looking for a full-time job?)

00:12:40.608 --> 00:12:44.416
(One of my clients is looking for
a full-time interpreter in Melbourne.)

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:48.272
(It's tough work, but the pay's huge.)

00:12:48.312 --> 00:12:49.304
When does it start?

00:12:49.328 --> 00:12:50.424
(Next month.)

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.688
(It's a long-term contract, though.)

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.088
(If I could stand being away from my bae,
I'd go myself.)

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:23.960
Tiger!

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:26.600
Hi, Je Meow.

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:28.376
Those are for Jiro?

00:13:28.408 --> 00:13:29.408
Yes.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.904
I'm not sure which one he'll like.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:35.824
Pick the blue one.

00:13:35.856 --> 00:13:37.528
Jiro told me he likes blue.

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:41.520
You can talk to cats?

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:42.750
Shhh.

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:47.688
Yes, I can talk to cats.

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:53.270
Kidding.

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.368
Cats see blue better than red.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:13:59.620
Oh.

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.140
It's in their nature.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:02.960
I see.

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:07.832
He's gonna like it.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:10.960
After you.

00:14:12.512 --> 00:14:14.510
Thanks for helping me carry these bags.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.848
Why did you buy so much stuff?

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:23.120
I bought ingredients
to make fried noodles for Lynx.

00:14:23.144 --> 00:14:24.488
It's his favorite.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.976
He's dropping by.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.184
I bought enough to make extra for you too.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.968
I saw you always checking out
Lynx's pictures.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.640
No, I didn't.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.520
Come on, I'm kidding.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.456
I actually wanted to cook for you

00:14:41.496 --> 00:14:44.104
to thank you for going easy on me
about the debt.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:45.750
So…

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.232
you already knew who I was?

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:51.656
I did.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.360
I'm sorry for paying back late.

00:14:55.392 --> 00:14:57.952
I haven't been well,
so I had to close the café a lot.

00:14:58.290 --> 00:14:59.290
But I promise

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:01.304
I'll pay off the debt as soon as I can.

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:03.130
Okay.

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.728
Why didn't you ask Lynx to help you out?

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:12.328
Oi, I was already glad
he even picked up my calls.

00:15:12.368 --> 00:15:14.330
We haven't talked in three years.

00:15:15.256 --> 00:15:17.260
I don't know if something's going on.

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:22.130
My son's a tough case, right?

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:24.024
Want to give it a shot?

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.432
If you win him over,
the cat café's included.

00:15:26.456 --> 00:15:27.456
I'll give it to you.

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.264
You're interested, right?

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:34.030
Let's go.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.400
Oi.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:46.900
Are you alright?

00:15:49.416 --> 00:15:50.416
You okay?

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:54.624
I'm okay.

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:57.360
I'll be fine.

00:15:57.392 --> 00:15:58.792
Just something that comes with age.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.096
Let's go.

00:16:04.144 --> 00:16:05.144
I'm okay now.

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:06.640
Let's go eat fried noodles.

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:18.380
Oh!

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.480
What time is it already?

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:24.000
Gosh, Lynx still isn't here?

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.968
Should you call him?

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.336
He probably had something urgent.

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:34.710
It's fine.

00:16:38.323 --> 00:16:42.729
No matter how urgent, he could've called.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.736
It's alright.

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:52.184
Just knowing he'd come
already makes me happy.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:58.584
I even thought he'd never
step foot in here again.

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:04.720
Cat owners get used
to being ignored by cats.

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.496
But when it's your own kid,

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:10.536
no matter how long it's been,

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:13.960
you never get used to it.

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:21.976
It's pretty late now, Tiger.

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:24.128
You should head home.

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:27.784
I'll pack you my Korat fried noodles.

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:29.192
You'll love it.

00:17:29.224 --> 00:17:30.312
You don't have to.

00:17:30.344 --> 00:17:32.856
Come on, my cooking's really good.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:33.832
I don't want to trouble you.

00:17:33.848 --> 00:17:35.224
Try them.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:09.416
Je!

00:18:09.624 --> 00:18:10.624
Je Meow!

00:18:12.712 --> 00:18:14.816
Je, Je Meow.

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:17.530
Je!

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:18.600
Je!

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:25.992
Meow~

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:41.632
(Hey! Call an ambulance now!)

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:43.048
(What do we do?)

00:18:43.096 --> 00:18:44.016
(What happened?)

00:18:44.048 --> 00:18:45.376
(What's wrong?)

00:18:45.408 --> 00:18:46.528
(What's wrong with Je Meow?)

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.760
(Why is Je Meow on the floor?)

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.016
(Have you called an ambulance?)

00:18:55.456 --> 00:18:57.040
(Call an ambulance. Call it now.)

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.200
Hello, someone passed out.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:03.992
Please send an ambulance right away.

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:07.624
PUNARI VILAWONG
8 AUGUST 1980 - 23 MARCH 2025

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:30.296
Where the hell were you that night?

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:33.024
Do you know your mother…

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:35.210
waited for you until her last breath?

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:00.144
Hey!

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:01.460
Hey!

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:03.780
Hey!

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:04.880
Hey!

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:16.744
I asked around.

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:19.656
It doesn't seem like anyone knows much.

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:23.184
They said his father
died when he was little.

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:25.056
They cut ties with their family.

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:27.976
His mother got pregnant
before the marriage.

00:20:28.001 --> 00:20:29.761
So he's been handling
everything on his own.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.680
Here.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:55.640
Do you feel better now?

00:20:58.760 --> 00:20:59.784
Who are you?

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:03.184
My name is Tiger.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.696
I took your mother to the hospital.

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:13.032
Oh, it was you. Thank you.

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:16.650
So…

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:20.608
what happened that night?

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:26.552
Something came up.

00:21:26.577 --> 00:21:27.577
What was it?

00:21:38.064 --> 00:21:39.064
I'm sorry.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:46.456
You should eat.

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:55.730
Hold on.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.528
Eaten yet?

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:03.264
I'm about to eat now.

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:05.488
I wasn't talking about you.

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:18.870
Hold up!

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:20.688
This bowl is for wet food.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:29.688
Were you my mom's regular customer?

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:37.230
No.

00:22:42.472 --> 00:22:43.968
I'm your mom's creditor.

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:52.816
To be more specific…

00:22:53.616 --> 00:22:55.620
your mother mortgaged this place to us.

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:58.544
And it's been overdue for several months.

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:06.328
Legally speaking,

00:23:06.633 --> 00:23:08.281
parents' debts…

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.504
don't pass on to the child, right?

00:23:10.984 --> 00:23:12.980
Now that's the plot twist.

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.592
But legally,

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:18.560
your inheritance
will be used to pay the debt.

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:20.720
So you have to choose.

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:22.152
Keep running this café,

00:23:22.184 --> 00:23:23.664
or go find the money and pay me back.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.464
Otherwise, I take the place.

00:23:28.576 --> 00:23:30.176
(Yeah, we're definitely losing the café.)

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.336
(There's no way Lynx wants
to keep this place going.)

00:23:32.368 --> 00:23:35.992
(But it's the only thing
Je Meow left for him.)

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:39.450
Hey.

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:40.510
Is there…

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:42.832
anyone else living here?

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:44.392
Just me.

00:23:44.696 --> 00:23:45.696
Why do you ask?

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.080
Are you sure?

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:49.344
Are you okay?

00:23:53.184 --> 00:23:54.976
Dong, let's go.

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.232
We'll come back tomorrow.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.624
This is my boss,

00:23:58.648 --> 00:24:00.736
taking off just like that.

00:24:47.656 --> 00:24:49.800
For crying out loud, Jiggo!

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:51.240
What's going on, Lynx?

00:24:51.272 --> 00:24:52.272
Lynx.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.232
What happened?

00:24:53.264 --> 00:24:55.424
Jiggo ripped my graduation gown.

00:24:56.430 --> 00:25:00.288
How many times have I told you
not to leave your stuff lying around?

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.320
So it's my fault?

00:25:01.376 --> 00:25:02.616
No.

00:25:02.664 --> 00:25:04.048
Cats don't know.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.560
They think it's something
they can play with.

00:25:05.584 --> 00:25:07.144
What you're saying is that I'm to blame.

00:25:07.168 --> 00:25:08.784
How many of my clothes
have already been torn up?

00:25:08.808 --> 00:25:10.624
How many books have already been ruined?

00:25:10.648 --> 00:25:11.424
Lynx.

00:25:11.448 --> 00:25:13.160
You always take the cats' side.

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:16.576
Can we just rent a new one? I'll go get it.

00:25:16.608 --> 00:25:18.688
That has nothing to do with this.

00:25:18.712 --> 00:25:19.656
Then what do you want?

00:25:19.688 --> 00:25:20.960
I'm not attending the ceremony!

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:24.776
What do you want?

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:27.136
You choose, Mom.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.760
Do you want to live with the cats or me?

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:57.616
(Hey, lil' bro.)

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:58.656
(Your fly's open.)

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:03.328
(See! He really can hear us.)

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:08.264
Yeah, I really can hear them talking.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:12.200
What happened to me?

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:14.904
(Je Meow must've used
her last drop of energy

00:26:14.936 --> 00:26:16.900
(to pass her power on to this young man.)

00:26:16.928 --> 00:26:17.928
What?

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.408
Je Meow could talk to cats?

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:24.368
How did her power come to me?

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:25.816
(How would we know?)

00:26:25.856 --> 00:26:29.752
(We only know this is a secret,
and you must not tell anyone.)

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:34.380
Who are you talking to?

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:40.560
I'm talking to…

00:26:40.592 --> 00:26:42.560
(Shhhhh.)

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:48.620
…myself.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.624
Have you decided

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:53.192
what to do with the café?

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.136
I'm not going to continue it.

00:26:59.228 --> 00:27:00.520
You can use it to pay off the debt.

00:27:00.544 --> 00:27:03.144
(See? I knew it.)

00:27:03.176 --> 00:27:05.488
(Then where are we supposed to be now?)

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:08.090
And…

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:10.320
what are you going to do with the cats?

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:12.784
Well…

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:16.880
I'll find people to adopt them, I guess.

00:27:18.512 --> 00:27:19.784
Or I'll send them to a foundation.

00:27:19.808 --> 00:27:22.488
(Granny Joo, what is a "foundation"?)

00:27:22.528 --> 00:27:26.824
(It's where they separate us
and send us to different places.)

00:27:26.848 --> 00:27:28.712
(What? No way.)

00:27:28.736 --> 00:27:32.400
(I'm not going.
(Jumbo wants to stay with everyone.)

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:33.440
Listen.

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:37.256
The cats here live together like a family.

00:27:37.288 --> 00:27:38.560
Why would you split them up?

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:40.528
Then you take them.

00:27:40.568 --> 00:27:41.760
I wish I could.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:43.944
But I'm allergic to cats.

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:47.248
Alright then.

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:49.220
I'm heading to the temple now.

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:56.264
(Oi, can Jumbo not go?
(I promise to be a good kid.)

00:27:56.288 --> 00:27:58.544
(Jumbo wants to stay with everyone.)

00:28:05.992 --> 00:28:07.312
I kind of know…

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.184
you had issues with your mom.

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.240
She told you?

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:13.464
Just some.

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:16.900
But you were coming back that night
to patch things up with her, right?

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:19.056
Keep running this café.

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:22.104
Your mom loved every cat like her own kids.

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:25.888
You choose, Mom.

00:28:25.912 --> 00:28:27.512
Do you want to live with the cats or me?

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.760
That was easy for you to say.

00:28:38.168 --> 00:28:40.170
You just pat their heads,
scratch their chins,

00:28:40.208 --> 00:28:41.984
take pictures, post them, and get likes.

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:44.080
But if you were me,

00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:46.728
all my clothes were covered in cat fur,

00:28:46.768 --> 00:28:48.256
and everything was scratched up.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:50.688
I couldn't go on holiday at all.

00:28:50.712 --> 00:28:52.680
I was stuck here cleaning up their shit.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.800
And I wasn't coming back that night
to patch things up with her.

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.080
I was going to tell her to
shut this place down, ditch the cats,

00:29:01.104 --> 00:29:02.664
and move overseas with me.

00:29:02.712 --> 00:29:04.192
And who the hell do you think you are

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.584
to tell me to keep running this café?

00:29:48.176 --> 00:29:49.176
Here.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:56.656
Lynx, I filled up the ice for you.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:58.688
Thank you, Krapor.

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:02.408
Do you know what your mother liked to eat?

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:06.256
Why?

00:30:06.296 --> 00:30:08.520
Today's the last day of her funeral.

00:30:08.552 --> 00:30:10.032
I want to give her a proper offering.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.544
So do you know what she liked to eat?

00:30:12.568 --> 00:30:13.568
I'll go buy it.

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:24.140
That's okay.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:40.980
Hello.

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:42.680
Grandpa and Grandma?

00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:45.480
I'm Lynx. I called you the other day.

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.616
I'm sorry for your loss, Lynx.

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:55.560
Thank you.

00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:57.904
So what happened to her?

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:02.904
It was heart disease.

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:05.500
She'd probably been
treating it for a while.

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.960
I don't know much of the details.

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:15.540
Wait.

00:31:16.344 --> 00:31:18.340
He hasn't been with her in a long time.

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.272
We should let him stay there alone.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:22.920
Alright, dear?

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:31.896
People can cut off family,

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:35.024
but they can't cut
disease out of their genes.

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:38.808
At the end of last year,
he had bypass surgery too.

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:47.976
May I ask you, Grandma?

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:51.280
What was the issue between them?

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:58.184
(When she was 8 months pregnant
with you, you suddenly stopped moving.)

00:31:58.232 --> 00:32:00.336
(The doctor said the cord
was wrapped around your neck.)

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:03.448
The patient has an
infection and is very weak.

00:32:03.488 --> 00:32:06.480
I'm afraid that if we operate on her,
she might not make it.

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:09.960
Tell the doctor to go ahead, Dad.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.416
Save my baby.

00:32:11.456 --> 00:32:12.456
Calm down, Meow.

00:32:13.104 --> 00:32:15.100
The baby's father didn't
even bother to show up.

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.420
Why would you still care
so much about the baby?

00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:19.744
Save yourself first.

00:32:19.768 --> 00:32:24.336
(The only way to save you
was to get you out right away.)

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:26.472
If you choose the baby,

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:29.976
you're no longer my daughter.

00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:33.960
(Luckily, the doctor managed to save
both you and your mother.)

00:32:33.985 --> 00:32:35.953
The sad part is…

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.288
after that day,

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:41.136
your grandfather and your mother
never spoke again until now.

00:32:41.896 --> 00:32:43.900
Mom and Grandpa were equally stubborn?

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:50.120
Your mother and grandfather
each loved their child more than anything.

00:32:52.216 --> 00:32:53.216
Grandma.

00:32:53.506 --> 00:32:54.506
Hm?

00:32:56.372 --> 00:32:57.976

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:20.248

The truth is, that night,
I was too afraid to see my mom.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.920
The person I went to see
asked me to stay and drink with them.

00:37:51.209 --> 00:37:53.213
I could've said no.

00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:57.010
But I didn't.

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:05.380
I knew my mom would choose
the cats no matter what.

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:10.568
What I didn't know…

00:38:14.432 --> 00:38:15.712
was that it would end like this.

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:38.760
Lynx.

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:42.510
There's a place I want you to come with me.

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:55.880
My job isn't fun.

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:01.520
I have to deal with people
looking at me with fear every day.

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:04.528
This is probably the only place

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:09.064
where no one looks at me like that.

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:14.088
Are you hungry, sir?

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:16.944
This servant will serve you right away.

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:28.088
What about that cat?

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:31.190
Would you like something to eat?

00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:32.810
Some bread?

00:39:35.528 --> 00:39:36.528
I…

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:40.790
I want to eat what's in the fridge.

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:44.540
But…

00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:48.232
it's been there too many days.

00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:51.380
I know.

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:55.700
Seven days.

00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:42.150
Seriously,

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:47.528
you pay to watch cats sleep,

00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:50.768
what's so fun about that?

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:58.208
To you, this place might just be a café.

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:01.200
But to them,

00:41:02.656 --> 00:41:04.660
it's their whole world.

00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:09.352
And trust me,

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:14.400
these cats will never forget your mother.

00:41:20.610 --> 00:41:21.610
How do you know?

00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:25.792
You talk like you can read their minds.

00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:39.080
I'll wash them for you.

00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:41.360
You should get some rest.

00:42:12.728 --> 00:42:13.728
(Seriously, )

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:17.624
(you pay to watch cats sleep,
what's so fun about that?)

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:01.260
I'm…

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:02.820
heading out now.

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:13.280
Hey!

00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:21.740
Thank you.

00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:46.232
I've signed them all.

00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:48.340
I just need your signature now.

00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:50.584
I'm just an employee.

00:45:50.624 --> 00:45:53.752
My big boss will send in his son to sign.

00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:27.392
Now you're my debtor.

00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:29.664
If you break the contract,

00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:31.990
don't say I didn't warn you.

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:01.504
Did you change the cat food?

00:47:01.528 --> 00:47:04.336
(Next Episode) Yes. Not only
that, I changed the litter too.

00:47:04.392 --> 00:47:07.552
(If you want us to get out there,
change everything back to how it was.)

00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:09.304
Hey, Krapor. Where are the other cats?

00:47:09.328 --> 00:47:11.688
Once I opened the
door, they all dashed out.

00:47:11.712 --> 00:47:14.232
You didn't mean to. Don't beat yourself up.

00:47:14.272 --> 00:47:16.328
But didn't they run off
because they were mad at me?

00:47:16.352 --> 00:47:19.384
Let's go bring Granny Joo's family back.

00:47:19.408 --> 00:47:22.928
I do need help, but I don't even have money
to pay you back right now.

00:47:22.968 --> 00:47:26.400
I help you run this café, and in return,
I get to be the cats' dad.
