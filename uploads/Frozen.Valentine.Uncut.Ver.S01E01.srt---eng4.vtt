WEBVTT

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.711
Hello, and for today,

00:00:15.711 --> 00:00:17.786
we’ll be holding auditions in two rounds.

00:00:18.154 --> 00:00:20.221
The first round will be introductions,

00:00:20.221 --> 00:00:21.741
showing your special talent,

00:00:21.741 --> 00:00:24.041
and then performing the assigned scene.

00:00:24.776 --> 00:00:26.057
Those who pass

00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:29.248
will move on to an acting test with our lead actress.

00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:34.272
Hello, my name is Pingrak Parin, I'm 19.

00:00:34.925 --> 00:00:37.000
I’m currently studying Communication Arts.

00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.736
You're passed the first round.

00:00:40.267 --> 00:00:42.997
This round we'll have…someone acting with you.

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.066
Okay.

00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.133
You can take a moment to focus and get ready.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.870
That day, I met Charm again.

00:01:42.627 --> 00:01:43.790
And I knew right away…

00:01:45.057 --> 00:01:47.424
those feelings never really disappeared.

00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:52.966
Charm, happy Valentine’s Day.

00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:54.066
I’m annoyed with you.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.933
No matter where you are,

00:02:35.333 --> 00:02:38.166
you’re still my Valentine,the warmest one I’ve ever had.

00:03:50.466 --> 00:03:51.266
Ouch!

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.333
Hey! Be careful.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:10.700
Can you get up?

00:04:27.933 --> 00:04:30.666
Hey…are you hurt anywhere?

00:04:31.366 --> 00:04:32.156
Uh…

00:04:32.483 --> 00:04:34.327
Do you want me to take you to the nurse’s office?

00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:35.661
Thank you, but… I’m okay.

00:04:35.865 --> 00:04:38.504
but… I’m okay.

00:04:59.733 --> 00:05:01.638
You!...Is this the senior

00:05:01.965 --> 00:05:03.627
who helped you the other day?

00:05:03.627 --> 00:05:04.127
Huh,

00:05:06.166 --> 00:05:09.706
that look.

00:05:09.706 --> 00:05:11.306
You’ve got a crush on her already, don’t you?

00:05:12.205 --> 00:05:14.578
Hey, what are you talking about?

00:05:15.191 --> 00:05:16.852
A crush on who?

00:05:17.533 --> 00:05:18.933
We’re still kids.

00:05:19.566 --> 00:05:22.818
Oh, okay. If you don’t like her, then you don’t.

00:05:23.166 --> 00:05:25.866
But I’m watching you.

00:05:26.366 --> 00:05:27.566
Cher, stop.

00:05:41.766 --> 00:05:43.800
You keep staring at Charm nonstop.

00:05:44.533 --> 00:05:46.466
You just stop and stare every time you see her.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.966
Well… she’s really nice, you know.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.966
There are so many people at school,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.082
but I’ve never met anyone

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.334
this warm before.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.666
If she were that kind, Are you totally into her already?

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.028
It’s not just that she’s pretty

00:06:12.846 --> 00:06:13.925
and kind.

00:06:14.906 --> 00:06:19.276
She’s thoughtful, and she’s always helping people.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.166
Your face’s turning red.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.133
Write it down, write it down.

00:06:52.066 --> 00:06:53.700
Happy Valentine’s Day, everyone.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Charm.

00:08:55.666 --> 00:08:56.666
I’m annoyed with you.

00:09:04.366 --> 00:09:06.266
I don’t like people following me around.

00:09:23.704 --> 00:09:24.694
Sorry.

00:09:26.618 --> 00:09:30.249
I just wanted to give flowers and… chocolate

00:09:30.249 --> 00:09:31.837
to you for Valentine’s Day, that’s all.

00:09:31.837 --> 00:09:32.541
I can’t accept it.

00:10:35.133 --> 00:10:38.616
A nerdy girl with glasses

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.580
has nothing special,

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.013
and Charm,

00:10:48.871 --> 00:10:50.315
who’s pretty,

00:10:51.541 --> 00:10:52.806
cool,

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:54.846
talented,

00:10:57.543 --> 00:10:59.462
and incredibly kind.

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.966
Wow, you were pretty harsh on her.

00:11:28.066 --> 00:11:29.002
I just don’t like that,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.913
girls who stick to me like a shadow.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:35.826
And I don’t want people thinking

00:11:36.398 --> 00:11:37.374
I’m playing around too.

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.169
Who could ever be better than your sweetheart, Mint?

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:44.096
Honestly,

00:11:44.545 --> 00:11:47.712
you could’ve just taken it to spare her feelings.

00:11:47.712 --> 00:11:49.370
And then give it to me to eat.

00:11:49.738 --> 00:11:51.872
Look at this, you already accepted so many.

00:11:52.689 --> 00:11:53.355
And trust me,

00:11:53.933 --> 00:11:54.766
by this evening,

00:11:54.966 --> 00:11:56.566
the guys from our neighboring school

00:11:56.666 --> 00:11:58.066
will definitely bring you more.

00:11:58.533 --> 00:12:01.294
I think you should prepare a basket for them

00:12:01.566 --> 00:12:04.234
Look at all this stuff, You won’t even help me carry them.

00:12:12.766 --> 00:12:14.966
Charm, let’s go.

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.466
They’re…actually perfect for each other already.

00:13:08.566 --> 00:13:10.366
Hey, what about the gifts?

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:20.300
Hey girls, could you help me hold this for a second?

00:13:23.666 --> 00:13:26.995
Umm…I really need to pee.

00:13:27.281 --> 00:13:30.052
By the way, do I have something stuck in my teeth?

00:13:36.766 --> 00:13:38.182
Sorry…

00:13:38.182 --> 00:13:39.770
Well…is there something in my teeth?

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.166
Charm!

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.966
Charm, I’m starting to get possessive of you.

00:14:03.333 --> 00:14:04.966
So many people are into you like this.

00:14:05.566 --> 00:14:06.966
Why would you be possessive?

00:14:08.366 --> 00:14:10.300
I only look at you, just you

00:14:17.333 --> 00:14:20.466
Then… tonight, let’s go watch a movie.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.376
After the movie,

00:15:03.275 --> 00:15:04.421
come back to my condo.

00:18:25.933 --> 00:18:27.876
Ugh…,you always gives me leftovers

00:18:27.876 --> 00:18:29.900
thinking that I will eat them

00:18:32.166 --> 00:18:33.666
But they’re good though.

00:18:34.066 --> 00:18:35.733
Of course they’re good.

00:18:36.133 --> 00:18:38.133
It’s Belgian chocolate.

00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:47.800
I think you should give up on Charm already.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.125
I can’t help it, Cher. I admire her.

00:18:50.493 --> 00:18:52.368
What am I supposed to do?

00:18:52.368 --> 00:18:56.571
Personally, I think she doesn’t like flat-chested kids

00:18:56.571 --> 00:18:58.600
like us, you know.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.400
Cher!

00:19:00.681 --> 00:19:03.266
She probably likes sexy types like Mint.

00:19:03.634 --> 00:19:05.948
Not nerdy girls with glasses like you.

00:19:05.948 --> 00:19:08.209
I’m not thinking that far.

00:19:08.617 --> 00:19:10.332
I just admire her.

00:19:10.332 --> 00:19:12.455
Just admiration.

00:19:13.358 --> 00:19:13.858
Yeah.

00:19:13.858 --> 00:19:14.600
Just admiration.

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:15.130
Yeah.

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.466
She said she’s almost home.

00:19:23.666 --> 00:19:25.966
I really want to go see Charmie

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.200
But…

00:19:27.966 --> 00:19:30.100
I’ll get cat hair on my clothes and get yelled by Mom, too

00:19:30.333 --> 00:19:31.600
I miss her though.

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:33.100
Next time, okay?

00:19:33.866 --> 00:19:34.666
See you.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:35.559
I’m going.

00:19:38.624 --> 00:19:39.465
Bye

00:19:39.465 --> 00:19:40.000
Bye-bye.

00:20:07.066 --> 00:20:08.150
I’m annoyed with you.

00:20:09.662 --> 00:20:11.482
I don’t like people following me around.

00:20:14.466 --> 00:20:15.266
Charm!

00:20:20.166 --> 00:20:22.733
I think you should give up on Charm already.

00:20:23.133 --> 00:20:25.649
I think she doesn’t like flat-chested kids

00:20:25.649 --> 00:20:26.866
like us, you know

00:20:27.466 --> 00:20:28.766
I’m almost home, Mint.

00:20:30.766 --> 00:20:31.566
Okay.

00:20:33.466 --> 00:20:34.480
Charm,

00:20:35.379 --> 00:20:36.286
sweet dreams.

00:20:39.166 --> 00:20:39.966
Thanks.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:53.500
Just wait and see.

00:20:54.733 --> 00:20:56.700
When I grow up, I’ll be prettier than Charm

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:58.733
and way hotter than Mint.

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:22.995
Do I look good?

00:21:22.995 --> 00:21:23.589
Turn left, turn right

00:21:24.529 --> 00:21:25.069
beautiful

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:26.800
Thank you ,mother.

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:38.983
I seriously can’t believe this.

00:22:38.983 --> 00:22:41.200
You grew up to be this hot.

00:22:42.333 --> 00:22:44.466
Look, I can’t even carry all these stuff.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:48.889
Hey… by the way,

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.590
have you talked to your parents yet?

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:53.645
About going to study BBA in the US.

00:22:55.606 --> 00:22:56.106
Huh…

00:22:57.266 --> 00:22:59.133
Cher, I don’t really want to go yet.

00:23:00.666 --> 00:23:02.666
I’m negotiating with my mom now,

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.000
asking to finish my bachelor’s here.

00:23:05.566 --> 00:23:06.262
Oh,

00:23:06.262 --> 00:23:08.266
have you seen this yet?

00:23:09.009 --> 00:23:09.509
Which one?

00:23:09.509 --> 00:23:11.400
Hold this for a second.

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.000
I’ll show you a photo.

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.200
What is it?

00:23:38.733 --> 00:23:40.666
You never forgot Charm, did you?

00:23:42.766 --> 00:23:43.566
Cher.

00:23:45.666 --> 00:23:47.100
Say whatever you want.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:49.966
That was a long time ago.

00:23:51.366 --> 00:23:52.400
I have nothing to forget.

00:23:53.266 --> 00:23:55.466
I didn’t even get the chance to remember her.

00:23:55.766 --> 00:23:56.566
Really?

00:23:59.133 --> 00:24:01.366
Your eyes don’t say that, Ping.

00:24:05.614 --> 00:24:06.114
Whatever!

00:24:06.614 --> 00:24:07.114
Oh!

00:24:07.966 --> 00:24:08.755
Can we go now?

00:24:08.755 --> 00:24:09.400
I’m tired.

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.000
Let’s go.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:10.500
Okay.

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:13.199
This one’s really heavy, what even is this?

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:29.910
How are you?

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:31.071
Tired?

00:24:31.071 --> 00:24:31.763
I’m okay.

00:24:33.866 --> 00:24:34.666
Kong.

00:24:35.333 --> 00:24:36.266
Hello, P’ Chee.

00:24:36.466 --> 00:24:37.266
Hello.

00:24:37.733 --> 00:24:39.066
How was today’s shoot?

00:24:39.733 --> 00:24:41.333
It was good. She’s easy to work with.

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:44.500
Hello.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:46.400
Hmm…

00:24:49.533 --> 00:24:51.533
Your name is Charm, right?

00:24:52.933 --> 00:24:53.733
Yes.

00:24:54.533 --> 00:24:55.866
Do you know me?

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:57.600
Of course.

00:25:00.566 --> 00:25:03.607
I’m about to launch a GL series,

00:25:03.607 --> 00:25:06.716
and your vibe fits the character perfectly.

00:25:07.819 --> 00:25:09.537
Would you be interested in auditioning?

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:12.900
Really?

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.733
Here’s my card.

00:25:23.533 --> 00:25:26.300
I hope we’ll get to work together.

00:25:30.266 --> 00:25:31.466
I’ll get going then.

00:25:32.266 --> 00:25:32.965
See you all later.

00:25:33.537 --> 00:25:34.232
Goodbye, Cheewin.

00:25:34.232 --> 00:25:35.944
Bye, you all!

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.271
Charmie!

00:25:51.006 --> 00:25:52.152
Come here!

00:25:53.214 --> 00:25:54.767
Playing hard to get, huh?

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:19.123
Whoa…

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.071
Almost a hundred thousand followers.

00:26:22.398 --> 00:26:23.520
Before now, how come I never

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:24.442
noticed that?

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.666
I thought I’d finally forgotten Charm.

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:39.366
But today,

00:26:40.933 --> 00:26:43.539
all those memories came rushing back.

00:26:43.539 --> 00:26:46.238
Stop it, Ping.

00:26:46.647 --> 00:26:48.123
It’s just a few photos.

00:26:48.776 --> 00:26:50.978
Why is my heart beating this fast?

00:26:56.166 --> 00:26:58.787
And if fate decides to mess with me…

00:26:59.482 --> 00:27:01.664
If I get to meet Charm again…

00:27:04.533 --> 00:27:06.065
Should I run away?

00:27:06.637 --> 00:27:07.879
Or…

00:27:09.041 --> 00:27:11.567
let myself fall for her all over again?

00:27:12.629 --> 00:27:13.333
Ugh!

00:27:38.133 --> 00:27:39.533
How’s the casting going?

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.733
Whew…submissions keep coming in.

00:27:43.133 --> 00:27:44.609
But I still haven’t seen chemistry

00:27:44.609 --> 00:27:45.700
that really wows me.

00:27:45.966 --> 00:27:47.966
We need to meet them in person to be sure.

00:27:48.666 --> 00:27:50.072
I want this series

00:27:50.072 --> 00:27:53.554
to tell a story about love

00:27:54.003 --> 00:27:55.116
and equality.

00:27:55.443 --> 00:27:57.916
It needs to feel beautiful

00:27:57.916 --> 00:27:59.385
and honest to the audience.

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:00.400
Alright.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:01.100
Okay?

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:03.506
As for the content,

00:28:03.506 --> 00:28:04.133
I expect that

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.976
I can show real value

00:28:07.976 --> 00:28:10.503
and sincere representation,

00:28:10.748 --> 00:28:11.845
not just riding a trend.

00:28:12.066 --> 00:28:13.152
Okay, got it.

00:28:13.152 --> 00:28:15.799
Well, if that’s all…I’ll brief the social team then.

00:28:16.044 --> 00:28:18.345
Should we set two guiding hashtags?

00:28:18.508 --> 00:28:20.829
The first one would be #LoveIsLoveStory

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:24.531
And the second one, #GLWithRespect

00:28:24.531 --> 00:28:25.031
Perfect.

00:28:25.266 --> 00:28:25.836
And we also

00:28:25.836 --> 00:28:27.800
need to appeal to foreign audience

00:28:28.066 --> 00:28:28.966
as well. Inter fans,

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:29.766
they’re really important.

00:28:29.766 --> 00:28:31.979
Make it clear, we’re making this GL series

00:28:31.979 --> 00:28:33.700
with high quality,

00:28:34.333 --> 00:28:35.779
We’re not just chasing hype

00:28:35.779 --> 00:28:37.166
or selling ships.

00:28:37.766 --> 00:28:38.759
Does that sound good?

00:28:38.759 --> 00:28:39.566
Sounds great.

00:28:39.866 --> 00:28:42.700
Once Charm confirms the casting,

00:28:42.866 --> 00:28:44.533
PR will be much easier.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.517
And for content like behind-the-scenes

00:28:46.517 --> 00:28:47.400
or workshops.

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.200
We’ll make it crafted,

00:28:49.366 --> 00:28:50.733
not just selling chemistry.

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:52.866
And when Charm’s deal is finalized,

00:28:52.966 --> 00:28:54.004
We must really know how

00:28:54.004 --> 00:28:55.700
to find the best chemistry match.

00:28:56.133 --> 00:28:58.106
And should we make short clips too?

00:28:58.106 --> 00:28:59.761
So it’s like…to make people

00:28:59.761 --> 00:29:01.681
understand the emotions conveyed through the series

00:29:01.681 --> 00:29:02.630
exactly as we want to convey.

00:29:02.998 --> 00:29:04.628
Some people might think we staged everything.

00:29:04.628 --> 00:29:06.700
or that we planned it all.

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:07.600
Good thinking, Jen.

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:09.600
Oh, and don’t forget

00:29:10.533 --> 00:29:12.500
to inform the university.

00:29:12.733 --> 00:29:13.675
Well then,

00:29:13.675 --> 00:29:15.258
I’ll ask my sister, Preem

00:29:15.258 --> 00:29:17.200
to help spread the word on campus.

00:29:17.533 --> 00:29:19.636
Okay. We’ll make our audience

00:29:19.636 --> 00:29:22.755
talked about this GL series everywhere.

00:29:22.755 --> 00:29:24.766
And let’s aim for awards too.

00:29:25.666 --> 00:29:26.466
So exciting.

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:27.666
Thank you, everyone.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.000
Thank you.

00:29:29.066 --> 00:29:29.866
Thank you.

00:29:30.766 --> 00:29:31.566
Sure.

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:34.600
Okay, I’ll be waiting for the casting results.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.000
Ping.

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:39.494
Oh, Preem.

00:29:39.494 --> 00:29:40.366
Hi.

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:41.400
Hi.

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:42.952
So…

00:29:42.952 --> 00:29:45.662
my older sister works at J Saffique Studio.

00:29:45.662 --> 00:29:46.200
Okay.

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.419
She said her studio is currently

00:29:47.419 --> 00:29:51.200
opening the casting for a new GL series.

00:29:51.486 --> 00:29:52.136
Oh.

00:29:52.866 --> 00:29:55.993
They asked me to find students from our faculty.

00:29:57.178 --> 00:29:58.912
And… I thought of you, Ping.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.326
I wanted to invite you to audition.

00:30:02.531 --> 00:30:03.031
Would you like to?

00:30:04.134 --> 00:30:05.500
You thought of me?

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:06.800
Yeah.

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:10.533
Well, it’s an open audition.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:12.300
No one’s locked in yet.

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:13.943
I also heard

00:30:13.943 --> 00:30:16.266
they’re approaching a model

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.766
to play the lead role.

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:27.700
Charm.

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:34.200
Do you know her?

00:30:42.133 --> 00:30:43.333
I’ll do it.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:47.500
Great, I’ll send you the details right away.

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:48.000
Okay.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:48.700
Bye.

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:49.700
Bye.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:54.600
Cher.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.300
Was that Preem?

00:30:56.666 --> 00:30:59.666
Do you know what just happened?

00:31:00.133 --> 00:31:01.500
She invited me to audition for a series.

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:02.629
Paired with Charm.

00:31:02.629 --> 00:31:03.129
Really?

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.166
Then you have to pass.

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:06.900
I really want to know…

00:31:07.566 --> 00:31:10.495
if you meet Charm again,

00:31:11.108 --> 00:31:12.423
will she remember you?

00:31:12.832 --> 00:31:14.375
I want to know too.

00:31:15.333 --> 00:31:16.992
If she sees me now,

00:31:19.035 --> 00:31:21.057
will she still be as cruel

00:31:21.751 --> 00:31:22.904
as she was back then?

00:31:22.966 --> 00:31:24.666
Cruel, but still lovable, right?

00:31:24.966 --> 00:31:25.766
What are you saying?

00:31:25.866 --> 00:31:27.060
If it were me

00:31:27.673 --> 00:31:29.389
who got those treating,

00:31:30.288 --> 00:31:32.086
I’d have stopped admiring her a long time ago.

00:32:08.666 --> 00:32:10.200
Yes, Pleun?

00:32:10.966 --> 00:32:13.400
Oh, Did your Phet just come back?

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:17.266
Okay, I’ll bring Ping with me

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:18.933
Alright, bye.

00:32:22.933 --> 00:32:24.300
Ping, my dear.

00:32:25.066 --> 00:32:25.766
Yes?

00:32:25.766 --> 00:32:28.879
This Sunday, you have to attend the launch of Aunt Pleun’s jewelry brand

00:32:28.879 --> 00:32:30.933
with me at our mall

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:33.838
Mom,

00:32:34.247 --> 00:32:36.309
do I really have to go?

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:37.484
Of course you do.

00:32:37.893 --> 00:32:40.075
This is mandatory.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.094
This event,

00:32:41.094 --> 00:32:43.400
also holding a diamond fashion show.

00:32:44.066 --> 00:32:45.200
Sounds fun.

00:32:45.765 --> 00:32:49.502
When you were kids,

00:32:49.502 --> 00:32:52.892
you used to play together.

00:32:52.892 --> 00:32:53.923
And most importantly, Aunt Pleun’s son

00:32:53.923 --> 00:32:55.996
just returned from the US. Do you remember him?

00:32:56.323 --> 00:32:58.129
You should talk to him.

00:32:58.129 --> 00:33:00.000
So when you go study abroad,

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.671
you won’t feel lost.

00:33:01.671 --> 00:33:04.202
If you need advice,

00:33:04.202 --> 00:33:06.161
you can rely on him.

00:33:08.266 --> 00:33:09.066
Okay, Mom.

00:33:10.166 --> 00:33:11.166
Good girl.

00:33:11.733 --> 00:33:13.733
Girl, you must dress nicely.

00:33:14.066 --> 00:33:17.000
I’ll have my secretary bringing outfits for you to choose.

00:33:18.166 --> 00:33:18.966
Okay.

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:20.400
Good job.

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:40.766
Thank you.

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:18.776
My life

00:36:19.348 --> 00:36:21.778
feels like it’s already been planned out for me.

00:36:23.004 --> 00:36:26.218
But sometimes, the path that looks perfect

00:36:27.362 --> 00:36:29.470
isn’t the one I want to take.

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:35.199
I don’t know if it’s fate…

00:36:35.975 --> 00:36:37.387
or just a game for my heart

00:36:38.858 --> 00:36:43.267
But that day was the day I saw you again.

00:37:11.733 --> 00:37:12.969
Hello everyone.

00:37:12.969 --> 00:37:14.450
Welcome,

00:37:14.859 --> 00:37:16.136
and thank you for coming

00:37:16.136 --> 00:37:17.698
to today’s audition.

00:37:17.698 --> 00:37:18.198
For today,

00:37:18.198 --> 00:37:20.709
we’ll be holding auditions in two rounds.

00:37:20.954 --> 00:37:22.925
The first round will be introductions,

00:37:22.925 --> 00:37:24.283
showing your special talent,

00:37:24.283 --> 00:37:26.703
and performing the assigned scene.

00:37:26.949 --> 00:37:28.418
Those who pass

00:37:28.418 --> 00:37:31.063
will move on to an acting test with our lead actress.

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:33.748
Number 009, please.

00:37:35.133 --> 00:37:38.178
Hello, my name is Pingrak Parin, I’m 19.

00:37:38.873 --> 00:37:41.761
I’m studying Communication Arts.

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.000
What’s your special talent?

00:37:44.566 --> 00:37:45.466
I can sing.

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:47.500
Go ahead.

00:38:09.566 --> 00:38:10.600
Thank you.

00:38:14.733 --> 00:38:18.266
Okay, let’s try the scene.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:20.600
Okay.

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:23.224
I want you to imagine

00:38:23.224 --> 00:38:26.200
confessing your feelings to someone,

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:29.566
but then got refused.

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:04.700
Hey,

00:39:09.966 --> 00:39:11.100
I like you.

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:31.666
I can’t accept this.

00:39:37.333 --> 00:39:38.200
It’s okay.

00:39:40.066 --> 00:39:40.866
I understand.

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:47.100
Thank you,

00:39:54.533 --> 00:39:59.500
for at least giving me the chance to say it.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:09.000
Okay.

00:40:21.166 --> 00:40:22.133
You passed the first round.

00:40:23.966 --> 00:40:24.766
I passed?

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:26.533
We’ll see you in the next round.

00:40:27.533 --> 00:40:28.333
You did great.

00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:29.500
Thank you.

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:30.066
Thank you.

00:40:30.066 --> 00:40:30.866
Thank you.

00:40:32.733 --> 00:40:36.237
This round, I want to see a love confession

00:40:36.237 --> 00:40:37.654
right before a kiss.

00:40:37.654 --> 00:40:40.456
We’ll follow safety protocols.

00:40:40.456 --> 00:40:43.702
We’ll start with holding hands,

00:40:43.866 --> 00:40:45.019
touching the cheek,

00:40:45.019 --> 00:40:46.336
and tilt in.

00:40:46.336 --> 00:40:49.415
When you tilt in, keep the distance within 10 centimeters.

00:40:49.415 --> 00:40:53.409
If the lips get too close,

00:40:53.409 --> 00:40:55.231
I recommend using a finger like this

00:40:56.011 --> 00:40:57.340
instead of an actual kiss.

00:40:58.035 --> 00:40:58.760
Are we alright?

00:40:58.760 --> 00:40:59.587
Yes.

00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:00.500
Okay.

00:41:00.966 --> 00:41:03.366
This round we'll have…someone acting with you.

00:41:04.733 --> 00:41:05.533
Okay.

00:41:05.866 --> 00:41:07.019
Well then,

00:41:07.019 --> 00:41:08.666
Stay focus as getting ready

00:42:20.566 --> 00:42:21.666
Pam…

00:42:24.533 --> 00:42:25.533
I love you.

00:42:30.166 --> 00:42:31.766
I’ve loved you for a long time.

00:42:38.133 --> 00:42:39.133
Pam,

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:46.966
Do you feel the same…even a little?

00:44:01.366 --> 00:44:02.166
That was amazing.

00:44:02.533 --> 00:44:03.666
Really amazing.

00:44:47.766 --> 00:44:51.466
Hello everyone, we’re the cast of Frozen Valentine.

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:54.200
So…how was it? Did she remember you?

00:44:54.466 --> 00:44:56.000
Not even a little.

00:44:56.533 --> 00:44:59.166
Wan, you really take such good care of Charm,

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:01.100
I wish I had a manager like that.

00:45:01.733 --> 00:45:03.466
Charm’s acting is seriously so good.

00:45:03.766 --> 00:45:05.400
The director asked me to tell you

00:45:05.533 --> 00:45:07.066
that you need to relax a bit more.

00:45:07.333 --> 00:45:10.200
Looks like we’ll need to add a few more workshop sessions.

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:15.933
No wonder my heart’s beating this fast.
