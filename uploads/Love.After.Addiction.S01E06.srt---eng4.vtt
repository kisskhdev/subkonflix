"Love After Addiction"

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.600
(Episode 6)

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.560
Next, who wants to perform?

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.959
If no one speaks up,
I'll just pick someone.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.960
I'll do it.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.120
Give me your harmonica.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.400
Here.

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.319
My name is Yoki.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.159
I...

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.400
It's complicated.

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:18.959
His skill is just so-so.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.840
Yeah, right, Brother Yang?

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.600
I want a turn too!

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.160
It's raining!

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:13.039
Go home and take in the laundry!

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.375
The clothes are all getting soaked.

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:14.800
Hurry up!

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.319
No, no...

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:16.439
Hurry up! Hurry up!

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.720
Go dance at home by yourself.

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:31.360
Really?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.680
Why did you leave without saying anything?

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:03.560
Weren't there so many people

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.920
crowding around you this morning?

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:09.279
You got even hotter!

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:12.519
No, I...

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:14.519
I... I am not jealous!

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.360
Who would be jealous of you?

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.360
I'm not.

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:20.199
Aren't you jealous?

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.160
Do you even believe that yourself?

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.160
I'm not!

00:06:28.312 --> 00:06:29.312
Xiao Meng.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.480
You look so beautiful today.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.800
Auntie.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.398
Do we look like a good match?

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:35.399
Perfect match.

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:39.439
See?

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:40.679
That's what everyone says.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.680
Get in.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.120
Get on.

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:50.279
No.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.800
Get on.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.919
Otherwise, I'll shout...

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.920
"Yang Meng, I love you!"

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:57.439
So the whole village will know.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.240
Yang Meng, I love you!

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.560
Yang Meng, I...

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:52.839
I'm sorry.

00:07:57.439 --> 00:07:58.439
Today...

00:07:58.879 --> 00:07:59.879
I went too far.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.520
I shouldn't have joked about my own safety.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.600
But...

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.040
Why didn't you ask me why?

00:08:10.713 --> 00:08:12.033
I was in a bad mood this morning.

00:08:12.839 --> 00:08:13.839
It was my own problem.

00:08:19.759 --> 00:08:20.759
It's fine.

00:08:21.279 --> 00:08:21.920
Next time, Brother Meng...

00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:23.359
Just remember to make me breakfast.

00:08:23.959 --> 00:08:25.279
I want oyster omelettes.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.240
What "Brother Meng"?

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.240
Don't you like it when others

00:08:29.319 --> 00:08:30.319
call you that?

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.200
So I'm the only one who can't?

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:33.799
Don't talk nonsense.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.480
Oh, right!

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.600
I found something in your closet today...

00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:46.279
Promise me.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.079
No matter what happens in the future,

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.280
no matter how important it is,

00:08:49.799 --> 00:08:50.360
you must never

00:08:50.361 --> 00:08:51.440
joke about your own life.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.720
Don't worry.

00:08:55.039 --> 00:08:56.240
I value my life very much.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.200
What exactly is your
relationship with Yang Meng?

00:09:09.559 --> 00:09:10.960
In what capacity

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
are you asking me?

00:09:12.759 --> 00:09:14.000
I'm just reminding you.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.880
Try to be a little more discreet, okay?

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.480
It's none of your concern.

00:09:19.039 --> 00:09:20.080
If anything, you

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.840
overreacted,

00:09:22.399 --> 00:09:23.519
a bit too much.

00:09:32.519 --> 00:09:33.519
Yeah.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.120
What right do I have?

00:09:48.759 --> 00:09:49.839
Still not asleep this late?

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.440
What are you working on?

00:09:51.799 --> 00:09:52.360
You came at the right time.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.600
Come. Sit.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Look.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.120
Along the main road into the village,

00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:00.679
If we set up two bus stops here,

00:10:00.919 --> 00:10:02.399
tourist flow would be better managed.

00:10:03.679 --> 00:10:04.679
And this bracelet,

00:10:05.519 --> 00:10:07.278
My hope is that in the future,
every person who comes to our village

00:10:07.279 --> 00:10:08.279
as a tourist,

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.840
could have a bracelet like this.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.080
That way, no matter how much time passes,

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.520
whenever they see this bracelet,

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:15.119
they'll think of our Lanwan Village.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.360
For them,

00:10:16.759 --> 00:10:17.879
it'll be a wonderful memory.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.440
It's very pretty.

00:10:27.399 --> 00:10:28.000
You are the very first person

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.120
to wear this bracelet.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.039
I made it myself.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.360
Don't break it.

00:10:35.679 --> 00:10:36.679
Are you... helping me?

00:10:38.159 --> 00:10:39.159
Not really.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:39.919
I genuinely think

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.000
our village is really nice.

00:10:42.799 --> 00:10:44.000
Every sea breeze here,

00:10:44.759 --> 00:10:46.080
every tide, I feel...

00:10:46.799 --> 00:10:49.079
this place truly deserves
to be discovered by more people.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.080
Count me in.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.120
I'll work with you.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.480
Your handwriting is so ugly.

00:11:00.919 --> 00:11:01.279
Look.

00:11:01.919 --> 00:11:03.440
This is the old route.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.680
It's already been adjusted.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.440
Really?

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.360
Then let me revise it properly.

00:11:11.679 --> 00:11:13.519
Why don't you stay with me?

00:11:14.279 --> 00:11:15.599
I'm afraid I'll mess it up again.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:19.840
Look here.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.976
The scenery at Little Wild Lake is actually

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.639
exceptionally, breathtakingly beautiful.

00:11:23.879 --> 00:11:25.120
But hardly anyone goes there.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.480
So here, we could

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.759
add one more stop.

00:11:27.879 --> 00:11:29.200
But we could move the Lanwan stop

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.360
over to this side.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:31.639
Right?

00:11:31.919 --> 00:11:33.159
That way, more people would go.

00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:36.519
And from this location,

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:37.976
around the Fishermen's Tribe area,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.080
if you look at the drawing,

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.720
we could actually

00:11:41.279 --> 00:11:43.159
add a bit more here.

00:11:43.759 --> 00:11:44.759
Don't you think?

00:14:54.639 --> 00:14:55.120
Ungrateful son!

00:14:55.639 --> 00:14:56.639
Dad...

00:15:30.639 --> 00:15:32.559
A true man stands tall
between heaven and earth!

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:33.919
You're a man.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.760
You must do what a man is supposed to do.

00:15:35.879 --> 00:15:37.279
You have your own responsibilities.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.840
Yoki.

00:15:55.639 --> 00:15:56.720
Can you understand me?

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.480
What are you doing here?

00:16:35.879 --> 00:16:36.879
What's wrong with you?

00:16:40.752 --> 00:16:42.152
You've been sitting here all night.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:43.720
Aren't you cold?

00:16:47.679 --> 00:16:48.679
When are you leaving?

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:52.840
What do you mean?

00:16:54.159 --> 00:16:55.159
Are you kicking me out?

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.600
It's fine if you don't leave.

00:16:58.559 --> 00:16:59.559
I'll be leaving anyway.

00:17:00.559 --> 00:17:01.559
Leaving?

00:17:01.679 --> 00:17:02.679
Where are you going?

00:17:03.679 --> 00:17:05.095
- Yang Meng...
- It's none of your business.

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:06.119
Yang Meng...

00:17:07.519 --> 00:17:08.599
Are you even human?

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:09.880
Who did I

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:10.519
stay up all night for?

00:17:10.799 --> 00:17:11.799
For me?

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:16.599
What is wrong with you?

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:20.599
Brother Yang Meng.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.240
Are you two...?

00:17:38.279 --> 00:17:39.279
Yang Meng.

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:40.559
Yang Meng.

00:17:41.079 --> 00:17:42.079
Yang Meng.

00:17:48.279 --> 00:17:48.960
I came... I came to bring you

00:17:49.039 --> 00:17:50.160
some tomatoes.

00:19:08.359 --> 00:19:09.359
Yoki.

00:19:10.519 --> 00:19:11.519
I'm sorry.

00:19:24.519 --> 00:19:25.519
Yang Meng.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.240
What's wrong?

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.440
Yang Meng.

00:19:35.319 --> 00:19:36.319
What's the issue with us?

00:19:41.119 --> 00:19:42.239
There is nothing between us.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.160
Come back!

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.440
Yang Meng!

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.240
What's the matter with you?

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.200
Get back here!

00:19:55.519 --> 00:19:56.519
Yang Meng!

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:00.960
Yang Meng!

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.440
Let me tell you—...

00:20:15.559 --> 00:20:16.559
mind your own business.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.440
He is rejecting you.

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.279
Do you not understand plain language?

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.480
Do you understand plain language?

00:20:25.119 --> 00:20:26.119
Are you done?

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.480
How amusing.

00:20:43.519 --> 00:20:45.055
Not enough fun in your
fancy celebrity circle?

00:20:45.079 --> 00:20:46.159
So you come here to mess with us?

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.160
Huh?

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.400
Can't stop hitting me, can you?

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.240
I didn't make all those
action movies for nothing.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.200
And what kind of saint are you?

00:21:01.039 --> 00:21:02.439
Stringing Ye Ran along on one hand,

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.120
and seducing Yang Meng on the other.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.640
Yang Meng...?

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.840
Stop playing innocent with me!

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.200
You big idiot!

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.000
It's Ye Ran that I like!

00:21:22.119 --> 00:21:23.000
Next time you decide to hit someone

00:21:23.079 --> 00:21:24.319
could you use your brain first?

00:21:26.519 --> 00:21:27.880
I should be asking you that.

00:21:32.759 --> 00:21:33.759
You really like Ye Ran?

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:34.960
What's it to you?

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:39.640
So...

00:21:40.799 --> 00:21:41.680
You intentionally made me

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.000
misunderstand you and Yang Meng.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:45.640
I admit it.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.240
I used a little trick.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.359
But it was to protect Yang Meng.

00:21:51.175 --> 00:21:51.774
I can't let my

00:21:51.799 --> 00:21:53.119
best friend get hurt.

00:21:54.359 --> 00:21:55.599
Especially by someone like you.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.200
Come on.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.720
Then tell me,

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.240
what kind of person am I?

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.520
The kind who dates a girl
and gets exposed as a cheating scumbag.

00:22:09.279 --> 00:22:10.839
And now comes here to bother Yang Meng.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.040
Who knows what your real intentions are?

00:22:14.039 --> 00:22:15.359
What are my intentions?

00:22:16.119 --> 00:22:17.200
Do I need to tell you?

00:22:18.599 --> 00:22:19.599
Then you tell me,

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.760
what exactly are your
feelings for Yang Meng?

00:22:26.279 --> 00:22:27.920
Falling asleep next to him the first time

00:22:28.599 --> 00:22:29.599
was an accident.

00:22:32.359 --> 00:22:33.359
No nightmares.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.560
No waking up in the middle of the night.

00:22:36.039 --> 00:22:38.160
After that, I found all sorts of excuses

00:22:38.519 --> 00:22:39.519
to stick by his side.

00:22:45.319 --> 00:22:46.319
I like Yang Meng.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:49.680
Quite honest.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.160
Then let's cooperate.

00:22:56.759 --> 00:22:57.759
Cooperate?

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:58.920
Yes.

00:22:59.359 --> 00:23:00.359
We each get what we want.

00:23:03.759 --> 00:23:05.400
We each get what we want?

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.160
Buddy,

00:23:12.599 --> 00:23:13.920
I never would have thought

00:23:15.799 --> 00:23:17.119
you're such a pervert.
