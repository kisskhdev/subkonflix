[Episode 18]

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.520
It was her.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.080
Is this

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.280
what you're looking for?

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.750
The Skysplitter fragment?

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.150
I don't need it anyway.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.120
You can have it.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:41.520
Ye Zhixin.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.470
Weigui.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.680
Ye Zhixin.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.240
Ye Zhixin!

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.750
Ye Zhixin.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:00.360
Are you all right?

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.960
Weigui.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.120
Something's off about Ye Zhixin.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.430
She might be from Tianwaitian.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.360
Are you sure?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.680
There's no mistaking it.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.520
She didn't want the Skysplitter fragment

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.710
because

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.360
she knew the fragment was fake.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:22.520
Think about it.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.000
Why did we

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.680
always run into members of Tianwaitian?

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.960
Rumors say the sect leader of Tianwaitian

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.560
has been looking for the Skysplitter.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:31.840
But I remember

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.120
that the sect leader of Tianwaitian

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.680
is a woman.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.910
There are countless martial techniques in this world.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.150
Moreover,

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.190
Tianwaitian

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.960
also knows many unorthodox techniques.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.120
So, she approached us previously

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:54.800
to get the Skysplitter.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.800
Divine Maiden?

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.630
Long time no see.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.360
It's you?

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.920
Ye Zhixin.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.720
Why?

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.070
Why did you lie to us?

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.040
Why did you want to hurt us?

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.160
We walk different paths.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.040
You can only blame

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.070
the Skysplitter you own.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.480
That was why

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.830
you went to extreme lengths to get

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:43.750
the Skysplitter.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.240
You're the reason

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.240
why Hua Xiaohua was poisoned.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.070
I see you've figured it out.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.190
However,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.830
it was the person whom Hua Xiaohua attacked

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:58.720
and you saved

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.360
in exchange for a pitiful sum

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.600
of bounty money.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.070
Just right ahead. The murderous woman and her lackeys.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.950
- Let's go. - Let's go.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.680
- Let's go. - Let's go.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:13.630
I'm sure

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.360
in the next few minutes,

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.360
you will be surrounded by all sects.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.870
Tell me.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.750
If they know

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.480
that the murderous killer

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.120
and the Skysplitter are both here with you,

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.360
do you think

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.120
the three of you can get out of here alive?

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.190
- Xiaohua. - Xiaohua.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.870
Weigui.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.040
It's time for you to decide.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.800
Hand over the Skysplitter

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.070
and I'll spare you.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.920
I showed mercy

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.430
but you didn't appreciate it.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.000
Weigui!

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.390
Xiaohua, are you all right?

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:48.480
Xiaohua.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:50.000
Xiaohua.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:52.630
What did you do?

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:54.560
What did you do to Xiaohua?

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:58.600
Xiaohua.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.600
It's me.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.190
Xiaohua.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.720
Lei Lingze.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.560
Quick.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:05.920
Kill me.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.920
Quick.

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:08.600
Kill me!

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:11.800
Weigui.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.560
Kill me now.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.160
Xiaohua.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.120
Kill me now!

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.190
Don't listen to her.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.680
Weigui, don't listen to her.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.190
My hands are already tainted with blood.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.510
If you don't kill me,

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.480
Lei Lingze and I will die.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:29.800
Weigui, why are you hesitating?

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.950
Kill me now!

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:36.310
Kill me!

00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:58.830
Xiaohua.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.510
Xiaohua.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:11.920
I bought this at the market.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.390
What a beautiful flower.

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:18.040
Not only is it beautiful,

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.000
it also has a special meaning.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.510
If you can give it to your beloved

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.800
during the festival,

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.630
you two will be together

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:24.560
forever.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.310
Lover?

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.950
I've never had the chance to give it to you.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.480
But now,

00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:40.120
I have.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.120
You two,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.600
please live well.

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:56.510
Xiaohua.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:57.840
Xiaohua!

00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:59.150
Xiaohua!

00:08:59.200 --> 00:08:59.870
Xiaohua.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:03.080
Xiaohua.

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:15.480
Ye Zhixin.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:17.870
I'll kill you!

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:26.600
Lei Lingze.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.080
You ruined my plan time after time.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.750
Are you trying to protect your friends

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:34.080
or be the first to take

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.960
the Skysplitter for your own use?

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.790
I want to protect my friends.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.360
I want to protect Weigui.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:41.840
Xiaohua.

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:02.480
I knew it.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.150
Forcing my inner force to unleash the sword technique

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.150
will only backfire on me.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:17.870
Where am I?

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:21.790
Weigui.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:23.720
Weigui.

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:25.360
Where am I?

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:27.720
This is Hua Xiaohua's abode.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.150
Hua Xiaohua's abode?

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:31.080
I saw it in her novel.

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:33.630
I was thinking hard

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:35.480
and I still couldn't decide

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:36.790
where we should live.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.510
So, I brought you here.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.480
Hua Xiaohua once mentioned this.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.080
She said her abode

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.120
was graceful and elegant.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:53.480
We

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:56.750
even made a promise together.

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:03.240
She said she lived behind a majestic mountain,

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:05.030
facing the pristine lake.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.910
Elegant, she said?

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:10.870
Hua Xiaohua

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:13.840
was indeed a good liar.

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:17.120
That was Hua Xiaohua for you.

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:21.120
She was a bubbly

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:22.670
and cheerful girl.

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:26.000
But we won't be able

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.270
to see the smile on her face anymore.

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:33.790
I killed her with my own hands.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:38.840
No.

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:40.670
It's not our fault.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.750
It's Ye Zhixin's fault.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:46.910
Weigui.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.000
I killed her with my own hands.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.320
I killed her with my own hands.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:57.550
Hua Xiaohua.

00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:59.550
Hua Xiaohua.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.390
I should die.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.080
I should die.

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:12.270
Weigui.
