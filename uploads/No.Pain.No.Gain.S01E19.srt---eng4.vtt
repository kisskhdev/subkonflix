(Adapted from the Qidian novel)

("Losing Money to Be a Tycoon"
by Qingshan Quzui)

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.220
=Episode 19=
(This story is purely fictional)

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.620
If they work for a company

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.550
like that for a long time,
they'll start to doubt

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.280
whether or not they deserve
to have a normal working environment,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.030
a normal working pace,

00:01:59.035 --> 00:02:00.670
and a normal life after work.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.140
So

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.190
we have to help them
get over that mental barrier.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.110
But how?

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.670
She just wanted to see
if we were working overtime at home.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.460
That's what bosses love
to check on, right?

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.020
Yeah.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.620
I didn't play the footage

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.700
to scare you.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.110
I just hope you'll be honest with me.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.390
I know you were pretending
to work overtime,

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.460
but that was unnecessary.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.450
The environment at Sky Fire

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.270
made you feel insecure.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.390
But don't worry.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.457
Rat race, office politics,
or emotional burnout

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.550
won't happen at Tengda.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.670
As for

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.830
Zhou Muyan and Zhao Xuming,

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.390
Mr. Pei has prepared a special plan

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.990
for them.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.110
They're about to experience

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.110
how Sky Fire's employees used to feel.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.950
Hold on.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.950
Clock in, please.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.270
Wei,

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.230
you just popped up out of nowhere.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:10.990
Clock in?

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.740
Your company doesn't do clock-ins.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.950
Special order from Mr. Pei.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.110
Both of you must clock in.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:22.550
Because

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:23.860
the system

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.020
only records your fingerprints.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.350
8:01 AM. You're late.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.990
8:01 AM. You're late.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.270
Come earlier tomorrow.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:36.550
Alright, go ahead.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.740
I'm going back to rest.

00:03:38.613 --> 00:03:40.270
I've been waiting since last night.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.670
What?

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.270
Where is everyone?

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.340
(Late Departure)

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.110
Where's your badge?

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:18.820
Mr. Pei says

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.590
both of you

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:21.820
must wear your badges

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:22.710
during work hours.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:25.940
Wei,

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.420
does Tengda even have badges?

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.670
Are you guys actually targeting us?

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.260
Even if we don't have them,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.030
does that mean
you don't want to wear one?

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.550
Mr. Zhou.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.409
What again?

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.990
Mr. Pei says we can't use the restroom
for more than ten minutes.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.070
You have ten seconds left.

00:04:47.102 --> 00:04:48.790
Wei is timing us outside.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:49.990
Hurry up.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.910
What kind of idiot came up
with this rule?

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.860
How could anyone finish in ten minutes?

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.910
You came up with this idea.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:56.550
You!

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.590
I can't afford another pay cut.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.060
Mr. Zhou.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.820
I'm sorry.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:00.860
I have to go now.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:08.420
Thank you.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.060
Thank you.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.060
Thank you.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.860
Thank you.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.590
Thanks.

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:22.420
Alright.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.060
Good work.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.860
Do people move more slowly

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.740
when they get older?

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.300
Don't push.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.620
Off work.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.820
Don't push.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.620
Enough.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.110
My bag.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.670
Where are we eating tonight?

00:06:03.813 --> 00:06:05.435
I heard nameless private kitchen

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.990
has unlimited free food.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.180
He can't go, can he?

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.300
Zhou,

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.420
reply to my messages

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.420
within ten minutes,

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.180
or I'll dock your pay.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.420
Zhou,

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.550
no phones during work hours,

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.550
or I'll dock your pay.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:40.670
Don't push.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:42.060
I...

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.670
Stop pushing me. My phone...

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:44.500
Hang in there.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:45.590
Say, Zhou,

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:46.860
I installed

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:47.940
a surveillance camera

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.620
just for you.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.180
Make sure you do your job properly.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.470
If I catch you slacking off,

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:53.620
I'll dock your pay.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:54.180
Also,

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.500
submit your daily work log.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.940
Miss it, and I'll dock your pay.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.670
Tomorrow,

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:00.820
prepare a presentation on

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.620
why Eternal Reincarnation failed.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.620
Remember to use plain language.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:07.990
That's all I can think of for now.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:09.500
I'll let you know if I think of more.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.990
- Off work!
- Off work!

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.420
- Off work!
- Off work!

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:33.990
Everyone,

00:07:34.568 --> 00:07:36.420
in response to
the company's strategic needs,

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:37.990
we're going to discuss Sky Fire,

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.550
which is my previous company.

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.620
Mr. Zhou.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:43.110
I'll briefly share

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:44.590
my experience

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.790
with Eternal Reincarnation.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:48.470
Many people see it

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:50.470
as a failure.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.150
But I think

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:53.940
most of you

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:55.420
never really understood

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.380
this game.

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:58.110
Mr. Zhou.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.300
What do strategic needs mean?

00:08:01.391 --> 00:08:04.124
And what do you mean by
"never really understood this game"?

00:08:04.168 --> 00:08:05.180
Weren't you supposed

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.180
to analyze what went wrong?

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.380
Just tell the truth.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.420
- Yeah. Exactly.
- Yes.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:14.910
Just be honest.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:15.500
Right.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:17.990
You want the truth?

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.110
Yes.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.740
Eternal Reincarnation failed

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.990
entirely because

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.110
Pei Qian acted unethically.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.990
He infiltrated Sky Fire

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.110
and stole our trade secrets.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:33.500
On top of that,

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.540
he tricked us into following

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:36.830
his marketing strategy.

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:38.110
And in the end,

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:39.500
my Sky Fire

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:42.110
was destroyed.

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.710
If it weren't for his conspiracy,

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:46.620
Sky Fire

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:48.740
wouldn't have lost that much money.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:49.860
So

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.380
Sky Fire didn't fail

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.860
because of our bad decisions.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.380
We lost because of

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.380
malicious,

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.620
unethical competition.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.740
It's utterly despicable

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:05.020
and shameless.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:13.950
Zhou.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.950
You're getting too emotional.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:20.230
Why are you

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:21.620
still blaming others

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.350
for your own failure?

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:25.260
- Exactly.
- That's right.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.430
Step back and look at it.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:29.950
Sky Fire blatantly copied

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:31.710
Tengda's

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:33.020
Returning to Shore,

00:09:33.146 --> 00:09:34.413
but failed to adapt it properly.

00:09:34.457 --> 00:09:35.590
That's why it failed.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:38.110
Everyone here witnessed that.

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:39.950
- Right.
- He's right.

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:41.230
I can testify for Mr. Pei.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:43.900
He didn't steal any trade secrets.

00:09:43.968 --> 00:09:45.368
You know that yourself, Mr. Zhou.

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:46.740
You never let us talk to him.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:47.740
Right.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:48.470
Exactly.

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:49.350
Mr. Zhou,

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.070
we never dared
to speak honestly to you.

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:52.310
But as matters stand,

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:53.990
how can you drag Mr. Pei into this?

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:56.470
We copied the game badly

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.350
and even threw away the best part.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:59.190
Am I right?

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:00.230
Yes.

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.950
She's right.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:02.230
Tengda's Returning to Shore

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:03.590
revived gamers' love

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:05.457
for classical poetry
and traditional culture.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:06.710
But we never

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:08.780
grasped its spirit.

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.260
Throwing money at it didn't help.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:10.950
Tell me about it.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:12.500
We should reflect on ourselves instead.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.070
Yeah. Well said.

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.990
Mr. Zhou,

00:10:19.213 --> 00:10:20.710
I believe you understand now, right?

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:23.020
Sky Fire failed

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.110
because all you cared about

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:26.657
was micromanaging your subordinates

00:10:26.657 --> 00:10:28.230
and sucking up to your superiors.

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:30.860
Your focus was never on the games.

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:33.900
You don't love making games.

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:35.140
You love

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:36.260
being in charge.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.470
- That's right.
- Yes!

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.900
So it was bound to fail.

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:46.590
What are you guys doing?

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:48.350
This is humiliating.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:49.740
Since when do you get

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.190
to criticize us?

00:10:51.924 --> 00:10:53.768
Do you really think
you're part of Tengda

00:10:53.791 --> 00:10:55.190
just because you joined?

00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:01.350
Tengda. You can't
even get the pinyin right.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:02.835
I noticed it the moment I got here.

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:04.500
What kind of management is this?

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:11.900
Mr. Zhou,

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:13.540
let's quit.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:15.430
No way we can't land a job.

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:16.350
Let's go.

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:18.110
Come on.

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:19.230
Xuming!

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:20.110
Why are they leaving?

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:20.990
Wait.

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:22.270
Leave now, and don't ever come back.

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:29.780
Mr. Pei knew

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:31.540
Zhou Muyan only stayed

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.350
for the huge payout.

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:36.900
Now that Zhao Xuming lost his temper,

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:38.590
the plan fell through.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:39.470
I know, right?

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:43.310
Don't worry.

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:44.500
Once you join Tengda,

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:45.740
you're part of us.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.380
- Great!
- Great!

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:05.190
After Zhao Xuming made a scene,

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:07.470
Zhou Muyan ended up
resigning voluntarily.

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:09.590
He didn't get his full compensation.

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.620
Mr. Pei,

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:12.070
how does revenge feel?

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.380
I thought it would feel great,

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:16.900
but now that it's done,

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:18.470
it's kind of meaningless.

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:20.900
So what if Zhou Muyan is gone?

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.230
There are thousands more like him
out there.

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:27.310
What about you,

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.990
Mr. Pei?

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:31.990
Are you going to keep going like this?

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:32.990
I knew

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:35.050
you didn't call me here
just to discuss Zhou Muyan.

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:36.710
You know, the way I'm living now

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:38.830
doesn't violate my agreement
with Mr. Sima.

00:12:38.902 --> 00:12:39.780
Alright, enough talk.

00:12:39.835 --> 00:12:40.991
I'm going back to work.

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:44.990
Mr. Pei.

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:48.260
The Sky Fire acquisition project
has reached its cycle end.

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:50.140
You need to sign the settlement sheet.

00:12:56.924 --> 00:12:58.791
Mr. Pei, don't you want to
take a closer look?

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:00.740
You may find a surprise.

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:03.430
Fine.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.740
Let me see how much money I made.

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.310
Sky Fire acquisition

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.830
ran at a loss?

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.740
After all, other Tengda projects
are making a profit

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:23.950
under your leadership,

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:25.230
so the loss isn't huge.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:26.710
But it's still a loss.

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:29.500
Your bonus from the loss portion
has been transferred.

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:39.380
So you're saying

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.080
that if I acquire a few more companies

00:13:41.102 --> 00:13:41.710
like Sky Fire,

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:42.710
could I turn profits

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:43.780
into losses?

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.830
According to
Clause 126, Chapter 5 of the agreement,

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:47.500
it would count
as a malicious acquisition.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.070
Stop. Say no more.

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:50.860
I knew breaking my promise
wouldn't end well.

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:51.740
I'm going.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:13:59.620
Ma Yang,

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.540
I've paid back the money you lent me.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:02.260
Thank you.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:04.900
The loss isn't big,

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.620
but it's still a small hit.

00:14:09.457 --> 00:14:10.680
Your appeal has been approved.

00:14:10.702 --> 00:14:12.768
Your designated driver account
has been reinstated.

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.470
Good things come in pairs.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.830
Why am I suddenly not used to this?

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.260
Why does it feel kind of cold?

00:14:22.613 --> 00:14:25.057
Are you confident about
the Divine Mountains and Seas?

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:26.350
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.350
Among Tengda games,

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:31.260
it's the largest in scale.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:32.020
I plan

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.540
to subcontract part of the production

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:34.590
to Late Departure.

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:35.260
That way,

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:36.813
everyone won't feel too much pressure.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:37.990
Pressure? What pressure?

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:39.090
There's no pressure at all.

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:41.500
Yeah. We're doing everything
during work hours.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:42.430
No pressure at all.

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:44.070
Liang,

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:45.590
you're different from

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:46.860
when you first joined us.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.140
You've got a lot of drive now.

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:50.140
When have I ever not?

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:55.070
It's just now I'm working on
something I actually like.

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:56.500
A rare genius programmer

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.710
like me doesn't even need overtime.

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:00.740
Just a little effort
and the results are great.

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:03.110
You have no shame, huh?

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:04.310
That's what makes

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:06.710
Mr. Pei different from everyone else.

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:13.540
He's way too different.

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:14.140
Yeah.

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:15.430
Way too different.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:16.540
A toast to Mr. Pei.

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:17.430
To Mr. Pei.

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:18.140
Come on.

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:21.260
Come.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:21.740
To Mr. Pei.

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:22.070
Cheers.

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:22.780
To Mr. Pei.

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:25.540
(Drop your worries,
make life a little sweeter)

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:02.990
Your turn.

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:10.350
You spaced out.

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:13.230
Hailu,

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.620
you're very capable at work,

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.900
but lately,

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:19.660
you've been distracted.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:22.780
The last time I played checkers

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.500
was in sixth grade.

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:27.860
I know

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:30.470
what you're thinking.

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:33.350
"Why am I playing checkers
with an old man?

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.590
That's childish and hilarious."

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.540
Don't underestimate checkers.

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:43.590
You think it's simple,

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:46.500
but the simpler a game is,

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:49.590
the longer it lasts through time.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.780
What are your next plans for Tengda?

00:16:58.590 --> 00:16:59.750
Your turn.

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:06.630
You said you saw
something different in him

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:08.580
that the rest of us didn't.

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.390
But look at Pei Qian now.

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:11.870
He just wants to make 5,000 a month,

00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:13.080
drives as a designated driver,

00:17:13.124 --> 00:17:14.670
and even works as a janitor.

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:15.710
He's completely given up.

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:16.740
He has no ambition at all.

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:21.870
Look,

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:24.390
as long as there are pieces
on the board,

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.580
I can use

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:27.870
my piece

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:29.870
or your piece

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:32.100
to jump over and move one step forward.

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:34.500
Every piece is the same.

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:36.190
No piece is above another.

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:38.430
I don't understand.

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:40.630
At this point,

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:42.670
what's the point of continuing?

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:44.190
Do you

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:45.150
really think

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:46.990
Pei Qian can become the person
you once were?

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:51.470
No rush.

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:53.390
You see,

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:56.870
once you've built enough bridges,

00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.780
sooner or later, you'll reach your goal.

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:03.230
Eventually,

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:07.150
you won't be able to stop yourself.

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:10.060
And,

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:11.190
by the end,

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.190
it won't be you playing
the game anymore.

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:15.950
The game will be playing you.

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:29.150
When Jinghong was founded,

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:30.670
all of us thought

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:32.870
we could keep going forever.

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:35.670
But the further we went,
the more we realized

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:37.430
nothing was in our control.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:40.260
After all these years
dealing with capital,

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:42.340
I've only learned one thing.

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:45.580
Once the game begins,

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.260
you can't stop.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:49.950
You have to keep playing,
no matter what.

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:11.180
(Fingle)

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:12.260
Eric,

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:13.710
please rest assured.

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:17.020
Fingle gave Zhao Xuming and me

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:18.990
a second chance

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:20.020
when I was at my lowest.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:22.710
I won't let down your trust

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:23.635
or your expectations.

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:25.540
Let's not talk about

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:26.780
the past.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:29.340
My dad has known you for years.

00:19:29.546 --> 00:19:31.020
He's always thought highly of you.

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:32.910
In the past, Fingle

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:34.500
mainly handled overseas game publishing.

00:19:34.702 --> 00:19:35.820
Now that my dad has retired,

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.340
I've taken over the company.

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:39.524
I'm going to lead Fingle
through a transformation.

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:41.990
Infinite Imagination

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:44.580
is our first self-developed game.

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.100
I need your help.

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:49.820
I'm honored.

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.260
As far as I know,

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.580
Tengda is working on
The Divine Mountains and Seas.

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:57.150
It overlaps in genre
with Infinite Imagination.

00:19:57.302 --> 00:19:58.710
Based on the development timeline,

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:00.780
our games will most likely launch

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:02.340
around the same time.

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:04.340
But I'm confident

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:06.260
that when the time comes,

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:08.990
Fingle will absolutely

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:12.190
wipe the floor with Tengda.

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:17.420
(CEO)

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:18.260
Well,

00:20:18.391 --> 00:20:19.430
I'm not concerned about

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:20.780
whether we can beat Tengda.

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:22.190
What matters more

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:24.260
is simply making a good game.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.260
(The Divine Mountains and Seas)

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:46.340
(Tengda Games)

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:47.340
- Bo!
- Bo!

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:48.502
- You're back.
- You're back!

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.191
Yeah. Today's the closed beta test.

00:20:51.191 --> 00:20:53.257
I had to be here
on an important day like this.

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.470
- Welcome back, Bo.
- Welcome back.

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:55.260
Thank you.

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:01.430
Roll-up banner.

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:02.190
Put it over here.

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:02.670
Okay.

00:21:03.257 --> 00:21:04.230
I'll leave this here.

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:07.820
Bo, you're back.

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:11.870
The Divine Mountains and Seas.

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:16.580
Nice.

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:18.060
Mr. Huang, you're back.

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:20.020
Wei.

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:20.870
Slow down.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.230
I haven't seen you at the office
in ages.

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:24.613
Yeah, I was revising the script.

00:21:24.657 --> 00:21:25.710
But today's the official test

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:27.010
for The Divine Mountains and Seas.

00:21:27.013 --> 00:21:27.857
I had to come back.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:28.260
Exactly.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:29.470
I even took a day off.

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:31.260
You know, this might be the only day off

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:32.540
I'll get in my entire life.

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:33.540
That's rough.

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.820
Well, no. Need a hand?

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:36.190
No. We've got enough people.

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:37.540
Yes. Move it further out.

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:38.780
Bo.

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:40.630
Ms. Lin,

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:42.580
congratulations.

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:43.990
You're here, Huang.

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.470
Not revising scripts today?

00:21:45.613 --> 00:21:47.857
Let's not talk about that
on a happy day like this.

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:50.020
Hold on.

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.430
I'm waiting for your title page.

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:54.340
Director Zhuang,

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:55.820
you call that a title page?

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.670
I've written 56 drafts.

00:21:57.670 --> 00:21:59.302
It's practically a different story now.

00:21:59.324 --> 00:22:00.430
And let me tell you this,

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:01.670
today is a big day for Tengda.

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:03.013
No one should bother me today.

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:05.780
Today's also a big day for Huang.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:07.990
He says no to people now.

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.340
This is the test build?

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:15.060
Yeah.

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:16.540
This chubby guy is agile.

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:17.150
Huang,

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:19.020
the combat system is amazing, too.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:20.060
Even Bao's computer

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:21.340
might not be able to run this.

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:23.470
It definitely can't.

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.820
Is that the Guardian of Justice?

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:29.870
He's throwing coins again?

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:31.013
That's cool.

00:22:31.035 --> 00:22:32.230
This is how he throws money?

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:34.190
Yeah. There are tons of ways for him
to throw money.

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:34.991
He's throwing money.

00:22:35.013 --> 00:22:35.950
Pretty awesome, right?

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:38.190
Ms. Lin, that's impressive.

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:39.230
I want to play, too.

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:40.150
Come on.

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:40.670
Let's go.

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:41.630
Gaming area.

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:42.580
Let's go.

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:57.060
Lv, use your skills.

00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:59.710
Slash him!

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:02.230
You two, step back.

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:04.235
The damage can't even
compare to mine alone.

00:23:04.257 --> 00:23:05.630
You guys are going so hard.

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:07.300
The thrill of combat is maxed out.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.470
Wei, you can catch fireflies
in this area.

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:11.060
Come over.

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:11.740
I'll pass.

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:12.990
I'm hatching dragon eggs.

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:15.100
This one might be twin baby dragons.

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:16.470
I see.

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:17.780
So chill.

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:19.470
A casual mode, huh?

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:20.950
Lin Wan,

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:22.020
the glacier dungeon

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.300
is so fun.

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:24.670
And it feels

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:25.950
kind of 4D.

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:27.950
My neck feels chilly.

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:30.950
Mine too.

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:32.910
Feels like a monster is staring at me.

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.740
Have you heard of this quote?

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:38.150
"When you look long into an abyss,

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:40.780
the abyss looks into you."

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:47.260
Mr. Pei...

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:24.710
Mr. Pei.

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:26.340
You said

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:28.540
you wouldn't care
whether we work overtime or not.

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:30.190
Mr. Pei,

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:31.910
The Divine Mountains and Seas

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:33.060
is just too fun,

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:34.820
and we got carried away.

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:35.670
Mr. Pei,

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:38.150
Lv got hooked.

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:38.835
You know, right?

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:39.710
We tried to stop him

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:40.430
but couldn't.

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:42.257
I wasn't the one
who started the overtime.

00:24:42.257 --> 00:24:42.740
Punish him.

00:24:42.746 --> 00:24:44.280
Make him go on a trip or something.

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:46.060
Mr. Pei,

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.500
I asked them to playtest the game.

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:50.390
We just

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:52.430
lost track of time playing.

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:54.540
Can you say something?

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:56.780
Everyone's really nervous.

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:15.060
Why are you all so nervous?

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:18.500
I just don't know what to say.

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:28.390
The Divine Mountains and Seas
is great.

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:30.580
Great job.

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:53.430
What was he wearing just now?

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:07.430
I've been wondering.

00:26:08.213 --> 00:26:09.470
What exactly have I been doing

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:11.950
the whole time?

00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:15.390
Why has Tengda become this good?

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:19.100
Am I actually succeeding

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:20.910
or failing?

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:23.390
At the rate,

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:26.260
The Divine Mountains and Seas
will be a huge success.

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:27.340
And you

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:29.630
will fail completely.

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:33.910
Think carefully.

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:37.430
If you don't stop them from launching,

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:38.630
Tengda

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:39.820
and you

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:43.060
may never get a chance
to turn things around.

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:17.580
Mr. Pei.

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:24.390
Today, you'll get to try

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:25.630
the cooking skills I picked up

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:26.910
while studying abroad.

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.591
What made you suddenly want
to treat me to a meal?

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:31.390
Without your support,

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:33.230
the game wouldn't have gone
this smoothly.

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:34.190
I wanted to thank you.

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:37.950
You don't have to thank me.

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:40.230
You guys are just that good.

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:41.300
No, I have to.

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:42.950
Your recognition

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:45.020
means a lot to me and to all of us.

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:50.190
Actually, I've noticed

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:51.820
you never seemed very happy

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:53.580
when past projects succeeded.

00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:55.740
Maybe

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:57.340
we're easier to satisfy,

00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:59.100
and you're aiming for something more.

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:00.820
But this time,

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:02.020
I can tell

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:04.390
you're genuinely happy about
The Divine Mountains and Seas.

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:12.060
This game

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:12.990
means something special

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:14.230
to me.

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:15.630
I hope

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:17.500
it can move people.

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:19.020
Before,

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:21.430
Tengda's games always won
in unexpected ways.

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:22.950
But this time,

00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:24.340
it feels like

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:25.540
the first time

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:27.100
we seriously made

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:28.820
a large-scale MMORPG.

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:30.430
It's different.

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:51.710
Do you know

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:53.740
why I was never happy

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:58.430
when our previous projects succeeded?

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:01.710
Sorry?

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:06.300
I mean...

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:12.020
I mean...

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:14.950
I never told you guys.

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.100
What I've always wanted to do

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:20.580
is...

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:22.430
You don't have to say it. We know.

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:23.950
You once said,

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:26.470
if you want to move more players,

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:28.813
you first have to move yourself
and the people around you.

00:29:28.835 --> 00:29:30.500
You can't just think about profit.

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:33.190
This time,

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:34.630
all of us put in

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:35.950
our most genuine feelings.

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:37.430
Everyone says

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:38.580
it reminded them of

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:40.368
why they loved this job
in the first place.

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:09.540

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:14.950
I've always wanted to
thank you properly.

We're able to work

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:18.740
without so many concerns

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:20.780
because you're here.

No matter what happens,

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:30.146
I'll stay with you all

00:30:30.191 --> 00:30:32.620
and make sure The Divine Mountains
and Seas launches smoothly.

00:30:41.657 --> 00:30:43.230

Stop knocking.

00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:28.150
Why are you banging
on the door so early?

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:29.100
Who is it?

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:31.150
Don't break my door.

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:32.060
Alright, alright.

- Qian!
- Stop looking.

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:48.950
He's not at my place.

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:49.630
See?

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:50.670
Tell me.

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:52.260
Where did you hide Qian?

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:55.390
My place is tiny.
Where could I hide him?

00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:56.430
Even if I really hid him,

00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:57.540
would I lie to you about it?

00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:59.910
I already told you he's not here.

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:01.340
Then where could he be?

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:03.430
Something must have happened.

Pei Qian last night?

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:23.020
What happened?

Who is it?

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:34.470
Why are they together?

Here's what happened.

00:32:56.910 --> 00:32:59.430
Last night, Lin Wan and I
were talking about work,

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:01.150
and I drank too much.

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:06.950
I've been tired lately,

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:07.820
so I

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.670
fell asleep on the couch.

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:14.820
Lin Wan was kind.

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:15.340
She...

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:16.580
She didn't wake me up.

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:18.946
She even prepared a new toothbrush
for me this morning.

00:33:19.013 --> 00:33:21.740
- We understand, Mr. Pei.
- We understand, Mr. Pei.

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:29.390

Awesome.

I've got a question though.

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:54.910
Why does the horse
my character is riding

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:57.060

That's no ordinary horse.

00:36:59.390 --> 00:37:00.660
That's a short-legged horse.

Its face is longer
than a regular horse's.

(but according to insiders,)

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:18.580
(one of its lead planners was)

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:21.540
(a core member of Sky Fire.)

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:23.580
(He was poached by the "Da" company.)

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:25.870
(And there's an even bigger figure.)

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:28.124
(The daughter of
a major real estate company, some Hua.)

00:39:28.146 --> 00:39:28.830
(Rumor has it)

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:29.990
(her abilities are average,)

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:32.390
(but her background is powerful.)

00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:33.580
(Looks like)

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:35.990
(this "Da" company isn't that serious
about making games.)

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:38.180
(There's barely any visible marketing.)

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:40.580
(Who knows where the money went?)

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:45.180
Even though no names
were mentioned,

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:47.080
anyone in the industry
can connect the dots.

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:47.790
It's obvious

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:50.430
they're talking about Wei and me.

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:52.140
These kinds of rumors

00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:53.580
are exactly what people love.

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:54.950
It went viral instantly.

00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:55.620
Wait.

00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:57.140
That Sky Fire's

00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:59.310
core member mentioned earlier was me?

00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:01.950
Wasn't I the one eliminated
at the bottom of the rankings?

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:03.180
This is unfair to me.

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:04.060
It's okay, Wei.

00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:05.060
It's okay, Lin Wan.

00:40:05.168 --> 00:40:07.450
This video was obviously
made by someone Zhou Muyan hired

00:40:07.457 --> 00:40:08.620
to smear us.

00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:11.180
I'm going to Fingle right now
to beat him up.

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:12.580
Scoundrel!

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:14.620
For crying out loud!

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:16.119
I swear I'll mess Zhou Muyan up.

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:16.910
Alright, calm down.

00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:18.700
I must punch him now.

00:40:19.702 --> 00:40:20.350
(Looks like)

00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:22.620
(this "Da" company isn't that serious
about making games.)

00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:25.580
(There's barely any visible marketing.)

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:27.580
