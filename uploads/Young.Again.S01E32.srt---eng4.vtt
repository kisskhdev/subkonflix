00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.180
Xiaofang

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:59.780
Is the bell in Grandma Jin's room broken?

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:02.340
It's been ringing non-stop all morning.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.760
The bell isn't broken.

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:04.980
Grandma Jin...

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.659
Her mind is a bit broken.

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.379
She just presses it for fun.

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:09.479
Let me tell you,

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:10.860
just this morning,

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:12.900
I've run over there eight times.

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:15.699
She's almost a hundred years old.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.939
Just like a child.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.080
When kids see things that make noise,

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.219
they like to press them for fun.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.719
Alright.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.000
I'll go instead.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.939
No need to go.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:27.599
I've already solved the problem.

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:29.080
I switched Xiaoxin to keep an eye on her.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.139
What problem?

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:32.900
Just those stories from Grandma Jin's past.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.580
What?

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:37.000
She's the Ninth Gege of the Aisin Gioro family.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.800
A close relative of the Emperor.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.000
*My Fair Princess*,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.879
was written about her family.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.199
Xiao Yanzi was based on her.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.099
That's not what I was told.

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:47.379
Grandma Jin told me

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.080
that Ziwei was based on her.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.919
No.

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:51.259
The old lady told me

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.080
Jinsuo was based on her.

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.159
Maybe Rong Momo was based on her.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.039
The image is much closer.

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:00.659
What are you saying?

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.620
Oh no!

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:02.759
Something happened!

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:03.659
What's wrong?

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.780
Grandma Jin is in bad shape!

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.840
Call an ambulance!

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:06.639
No.

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:08.819
Grandma Jin's bracelet is missing.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.460
Gold?

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.159
Jade?

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.680
Red agate? Turquoise?

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:14.060
An ancestral bracelet.

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.460
Yeah, I think I've seen that bracelet.

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:17.900
Grandma Jin said

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.620
the Emperor brought it out of the palace.

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:20.319
Come on.

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:22.219
I don't think we need an ambulance.

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:23.900
Call the police immediately.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.819
Wait.

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:26.460
If word gets out,

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.159
it'll be bad for our community's reputation.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.360
Maybe we should report to Director Chang first.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.800
I think

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.419
Yingzi has a point.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.039
So my opinion is,

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:36.819
we first check the surveillance footage nearby

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:38.000
and screen for suspects.

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:39.139
At the same time,

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:40.939
you need to go talk to Grandma Jin.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.159
Find out exactly what happened.

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:42.659
Okay.

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:43.659
Okay.

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.759
What are you waiting for?

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:45.259
Go!

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.939
Watch how you talk to her.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.219
Okay.

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:53.139
Have a seat.

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:53.900
Grandma,

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.800
I heard your bracelet is missing.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:58.659
What?

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.960
The bracelet!

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.960
The one...

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.280
the one you brought out of the palace.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.919
To tell you the truth,

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.280
that bracelet

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.460
was smuggled out of the Palace.

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.620
Even the Emperor didn't know.

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:14.500
Grandma,

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:15.860
the Emperor might not know,

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.300
but we need to figure this out.

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:19.720
Where exactly did it go?

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:20.740
Yeah, Grandma.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.839
We don't care how it came to be,

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.839
we just care how it went missing.

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:25.519
Exactly.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.860
Grandma,

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:28.500
think again.

00:04:28.579 --> 00:04:29.699
Where did you put the bracelet?

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:30.439
Right here.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.139
No...

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.160
maybe it's over there.

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:35.620
No...

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.040
probably over there.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.939
No, wait a minute.

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:39.980
Let me... let me think.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.660
No, let me think where...

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:42.480
Anyway,

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:44.240
after you finished cleaning,

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:45.579
the thing couldn't be found.

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:48.980
We didn't get any clues,

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:50.600
but we became suspects instead.

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:51.860
Just our luck.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.480
We learned in Criminal Sociology class,

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:55.699
theoretically,

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.379
everyone who has been to the scene

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.560
is a suspect.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.100
So the fact that you are suspects

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.100
makes sense.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.319
You're the one who's a suspect!

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:04.699
You're slandering us and gloating!

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:07.060
I think Wang Song is right.

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:09.240
If you want to prove you aren't suspects,

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.740
you have to provide evidence.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.100
Do you have evidence to prove

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.199
you didn't steal the bracelet?

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:14.139
This...

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.339
how can we prove that?

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:17.779
What kind of evidence do we need?

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:18.439
If you have it,

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:19.519
you can prove it.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.459
If you don't, how can you prove it?

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:24.620
Then there's no way to clear your suspicion.

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:26.300
Alright,

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:27.600
stop bickering, everyone.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.860
This matter

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:31.240
concerns all of us

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.759
and the reputation of our social practice.

00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:34.500
So no matter what,

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.339
we must solve this case.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.680
Isn't it just solving a case?

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:39.540
I'll do it.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:40.779
You?

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.379
I'm a die-hard fan of Conan Doyle.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.199
Known as

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.300
the modern-day

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.399
Sherlock Holmes.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.040
You're a fan of the anime Conan, right?

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.600
Conan is short for Conan Doyle.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.639
Your Sherlock Holmes is a knock-off.

00:05:58.519 --> 00:05:59.360
Look at this.

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:00.540
Agatha

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:02.319
Christie's great detective,

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.639
Poirot.

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:07.300
"Do not let evil enter your heart,

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.980
for it will make a home

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.339
there."

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.699
It has to be Conan.

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:13.779
Hocker Poirot.

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:14.160
Conan.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:14.639
Poirot.

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:14.839
Conan.

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:15.839
Enough.

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:16.800
Alright.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.420
Solving the case is up to you two.

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:22.319
Let's see if Conan is better,

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:23.779
or if Poirot is better.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.259
I...

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.319
The real-life Conan is here.

00:06:28.519 --> 00:06:29.720
I solve every case.

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:30.540
There is

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.600
only one truth!

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.720
Grandma,

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:34.220
let me walk you through

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.079
the timeline of the incident.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:37.959
When the bracelet went missing,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.819
did anything important happen?

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.000
Also,

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:44.079
were you wearing the bracelet,

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:45.160
or had you taken it off?

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:46.439
I don't remember.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.079
Anyway,

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:50.899
if I wasn't wearing it,

00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:52.459
then I had taken it off.

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:56.500
For a gold-inlaid jade bracelet like this,

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:58.459
back in the palace,

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:01.439
everyone had a jewelry box.

00:07:02.019 --> 00:07:03.959
The custom was to

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.579
rotate them.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.879
Daily disposable.

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:08.860
Grandma,

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:10.860
let's not talk about the palace.

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:13.000
Let's just confirm one thing.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.639
At that time, the bracelet...

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:15.660
did you actually

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.480
wear it,

00:07:16.579 --> 00:07:17.839
or take it off?

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:19.379
You child,

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:22.459
why is your memory so bad?

00:07:22.579 --> 00:07:24.639
You should eat some walnuts

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:25.920
to boost your brain.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.759
Didn't I tell you?

00:07:27.899 --> 00:07:29.060
If I didn't wear it,

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.240
I took it off.

00:07:32.079 --> 00:07:32.720
Calm down.

00:07:32.939 --> 00:07:33.519
Calm down.

00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:34.319
There is

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.279
only one truth.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.819
You're just talking...

00:07:36.959 --> 00:07:38.000
talking nonsense.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.560
Leave it to me.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.540
Conan,

00:07:40.779 --> 00:07:41.720
you should retire.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.959
The Great Detective Poirot

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.540
has arrived.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:50.779
Ms. Jin

00:07:51.699 --> 00:07:52.199
Young

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.579
man

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:55.839
How many

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.819
days has it been since you shaved?

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:00.720
This razor...

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:02.439
Grandma doesn't have one here

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.459
Look, this...

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.259
What do I need a razor for, Grandma?

00:08:07.339 --> 00:08:08.819
I am the great detective

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.279
Poirot

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.819
Broken gong?

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.959
Who's beating a broken gong?

00:08:14.019 --> 00:08:15.959
Why would I beat a broken gong?

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.160
The great detective Poirot

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.920
Po... or broken gong?

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:20.839
Still...

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.639
such a nice young man

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.839
Why pick such a name?

00:08:25.279 --> 00:08:26.879
Of course, it's to

00:08:27.259 --> 00:08:28.240
solve cases

00:08:28.839 --> 00:08:29.899
Scrap

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.980
You collect scrap too?

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.940
I see

00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:39.399
When collecting scrap

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.740
you have to beat a broken gong

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:42.960
right?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.120
What do you mean "right"?

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.580
Let's cut the nonsense

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:46.820
From now on

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.299
I will ask you questions

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.480
You only need to answer

00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:53.220
yes or no

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.580
Just yes or no is enough

00:08:56.779 --> 00:08:57.659
Do you understand?

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:58.899
Understood

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.279
Understood

00:09:00.659 --> 00:09:02.580
Nod for yes, shake for no

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:03.840
"Lai" is Come

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.899
"Qu" is Go

00:09:04.899 --> 00:09:06.159
Stop

00:09:06.159 --> 00:09:07.059
Stop

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.100
I'll start asking you questions now

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:11.559
Ms. Jin

00:09:12.259 --> 00:09:14.779
Do many people like your

00:09:15.259 --> 00:09:16.419
bracelet?

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.139
Yes

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.840
They like your bracelet

00:09:20.899 --> 00:09:23.100
Do they come to see you often?

00:09:24.179 --> 00:09:25.940
Kind of "Yes"

00:09:26.059 --> 00:09:27.159
Then do you know

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.820
the names of those who like your bracelet?

00:09:30.019 --> 00:09:30.879
Tell me

00:09:31.039 --> 00:09:31.659
I'll write them down

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.000
That's a big "Yes"

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:35.740
Well...

00:09:35.799 --> 00:09:36.440
Come on

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:37.179
Speak slowly

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:37.720
The first one

00:09:42.279 --> 00:09:42.980
Young

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.419
ladies,

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:45.879
gentlemen,

00:09:46.539 --> 00:09:47.539
mesdames,

00:09:49.279 --> 00:09:50.299
it is time to conclude.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:53.139
Now,

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.480
I already know very clearly

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.799
who stole Ms. Jin's bracelet.

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:01.019
At first,

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.000
I mistakenly thought

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.620
that there was definitely one person

00:10:04.679 --> 00:10:06.559
who sneaked into the room

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:07.899
and stole the bracelet.

00:10:08.259 --> 00:10:08.820
No.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.539
The truth may

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:13.240
not be like that.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.720
Those with the means,

00:10:15.179 --> 00:10:16.519
those with the motive,

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.460
the person who stole the bracelet

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.659
actually,

00:10:20.039 --> 00:10:21.559
is more than one.

00:10:23.259 --> 00:10:24.899
Is there something wrong with this kid?

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.440
I think he's a bit delusional.

00:10:27.059 --> 00:10:27.940
I think so too.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.000
Auntie Cai,

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:30.879
can we

00:10:30.879 --> 00:10:32.519
not be so dramatic, baby?

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.200
Did you once ask Grandma Jin

00:10:36.259 --> 00:10:39.000
how much the bracelet from the palace is worth?

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.100
Yes,

00:10:40.299 --> 00:10:41.200
I did ask.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.639
Just idle curiosity.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:46.320
Your son and daughter-in-law asked for money a few days ago,

00:10:46.539 --> 00:10:49.480
saying they needed a gift for the Relocation Office staff.

00:10:49.519 --> 00:10:51.279
You said don't waste that money,

00:10:51.279 --> 00:10:52.820
you would find something ready-made.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.159
Is this true?

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.320
And wouldn't you know,

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.600
this bracelet is a ready-made gift.

00:11:00.419 --> 00:11:01.220
Therefore,

00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:02.919
it is very likely that you,

00:11:03.019 --> 00:11:05.100
when Grandma Jin was not around,

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.480
just

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.360
This is completely made up.

00:11:29.419 --> 00:11:31.220
It's a huge injustice!

00:11:32.059 --> 00:11:32.600
Xiao Cai.

00:11:33.259 --> 00:11:34.379
If you really took it,

00:11:34.379 --> 00:11:35.320
take it out right now.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.820
We'll pretend we didn't hear anything.

00:11:36.879 --> 00:11:37.679
Uncle Liang.

00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:41.720
Auntie Cai's

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.919
son and daughter-in-law, before they looked for her,

00:11:43.919 --> 00:11:45.460
did they come to see you?

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.419
Yes.

00:11:46.419 --> 00:11:47.360
He was...

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:48.580
asking me for advice

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.460
on what gift for the Relocation Office

00:11:50.539 --> 00:11:51.340
would be more suitable.

00:11:52.279 --> 00:11:53.139
You told him

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.980
to ask Auntie Cai for it,

00:11:55.639 --> 00:11:58.200
which cast suspicion on Auntie Cai,

00:11:58.419 --> 00:11:59.840
thereby covering up

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:00.980
the real

00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:02.200
criminal.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.539
You mean...

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.139
you suspect me?

00:12:07.039 --> 00:12:09.159
The day Grandma Jin lost her bracelet,

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.200
didn't you invite Grandma Jin

00:12:11.259 --> 00:12:12.399
to have tea?

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:12.940
Yes.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.779
And you pushed Grandma Jin to the lakeside.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:16.740
Why don't you say

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.399
I pushed the old lady into the lake?

00:12:19.519 --> 00:12:21.259
After you pushed her there,

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.840
Grandma Jin's bracelet went missing.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:24.879
The process

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.320
could very well

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.440
be like this:

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:33.899
Grandma Jin,

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:36.980
old lady,

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.259
the sun is so nice.

00:12:38.259 --> 00:12:39.500
Let me take you for a stroll.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:40.980
I'll take you for a stroll.

00:12:42.059 --> 00:12:43.039
Don't move.

00:12:43.379 --> 00:12:44.539
Okay, let's go.

00:12:46.679 --> 00:12:47.940
Great.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.399
This is just great.

00:12:50.879 --> 00:12:52.059
Come on,

00:12:52.059 --> 00:12:53.200
let me push you.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:55.460
You're talking nonsense!

00:12:56.159 --> 00:12:57.340
That's appalling!

00:12:57.399 --> 00:12:59.240
I did a good deed and now I'm at fault?

00:12:59.299 --> 00:12:59.799
No,

00:12:59.799 --> 00:13:01.299
don't get angry, sir.

00:13:01.299 --> 00:13:03.500
We won't wrong a good person,

00:13:03.559 --> 00:13:04.340
but

00:13:04.879 --> 00:13:07.259
we won't let a bad person go either.

00:13:07.559 --> 00:13:08.460
Uncle Liang,

00:13:08.919 --> 00:13:10.600
think carefully.

00:13:10.679 --> 00:13:11.639
Who was it

00:13:12.039 --> 00:13:14.840
that asked you to push Grandma Jin to the lake?

00:13:17.179 --> 00:13:17.759
Manager Li.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:19.980
It was him.

00:13:20.779 --> 00:13:22.940
He said the old lady hadn't had sun for days,

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.200
and everyone was probably busy,

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.080
so no one pushed her.

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:26.379
I thought, "I have time,"

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:27.879
so I took the old lady out.

00:13:29.159 --> 00:13:29.980
Manager Li,

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.460
since you knew very well

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:36.360
Grandma Jin hadn't gone out for days,

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.419
you yourself,

00:13:38.419 --> 00:13:40.600
why didn't you take Grandma Jin out?

00:13:40.659 --> 00:13:41.340
Yeah.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.500
Your warm-heartedness

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.679
throughout our Evergreen Residence

00:13:45.779 --> 00:13:47.679
is famous.

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:48.940
You...

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.220
you actually dare to suspect me?

00:13:53.539 --> 00:13:55.139
Saying I used the "Lure the tiger from the mountain" ploy?

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:55.779
Look,

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.259
you don't deny this possibility, do you?

00:13:59.519 --> 00:14:01.259
It is entirely possible that you,

00:14:01.299 --> 00:14:04.620
after Uncle Liang pushed Grandma Jin away,

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:05.860
just...

00:14:33.139 --> 00:14:34.480
This is a complete frame-up

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.580
Persecution

00:14:35.659 --> 00:14:36.659
Pure fabrication

00:14:36.659 --> 00:14:38.139
I protest! I, Old Li...

00:14:38.139 --> 00:14:40.000
Old Li, don't get so excited

00:14:40.059 --> 00:14:40.759
If you really didn't take it

00:14:40.759 --> 00:14:41.940
What are you nervous about?

00:14:42.919 --> 00:14:44.159
The bracelet

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:46.320
Did President Li take it?

00:14:46.559 --> 00:14:47.779
Professor Fan

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.559
You know best, don't you?

00:14:52.919 --> 00:14:54.360
What do I know?

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.200
That day

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.860
Didn't you also go

00:14:57.919 --> 00:14:59.600
to Grandma Jin's room?

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:00.419
Well...

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:01.519
Yes

00:15:01.519 --> 00:15:02.340
Was it that day?

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.419
I went to look for Xiaofang

00:15:06.059 --> 00:15:07.340
I saw no one in the room

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:08.299
So I left

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.000
What bracelet?

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.399
I didn't see it at all

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:12.179
The truth

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.580
Could it be like this?

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:16.399
Xiaofang

00:15:17.259 --> 00:15:17.899
Xiaofang

00:15:36.259 --> 00:15:38.320
I have absolutely no motive

00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:39.779
I'm a man

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.000
What would I want a bracelet for?

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:42.519
To give as a gift?

00:15:42.799 --> 00:15:44.600
It is a unique item

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.240
rich in historical and cultural meaning

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.480
A royal bracelet

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.899
It signifies that the giver

00:15:49.899 --> 00:15:52.139
has superb artistic taste

00:15:52.139 --> 00:15:55.580
instantly inspiring respect and affection

00:15:55.639 --> 00:15:56.980
But who would I give it to?

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.080
Presumably

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.100
a lady you admire

00:16:00.159 --> 00:16:01.700
and have pursued for a long time

00:16:01.759 --> 00:16:04.000
and are just one step away from

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.399
That lady

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.480
For example, Teacher Liu

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.419
The problem is Teacher Liu

00:16:12.539 --> 00:16:14.960
She knows that bracelet is Grandma Jin's

00:16:15.059 --> 00:16:15.840
If I gave her this

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.519
wouldn't it prove I'm a thief?

00:16:19.299 --> 00:16:20.179
So

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.720
there is another possibility

00:16:22.779 --> 00:16:23.820
It wasn't you

00:16:23.899 --> 00:16:26.019
who gave it to Teacher Liu

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:28.480
It was Teacher Liu who...

00:16:34.679 --> 00:16:35.399
You...

00:16:35.399 --> 00:16:38.159
You're saying I sent him to steal it?

00:16:39.139 --> 00:16:39.700
I...

00:16:40.379 --> 00:16:40.860
I...

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.220
Even if I jumped into the Yellow River

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:43.500
I could never wash this clean!

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:43.759
No

00:16:43.759 --> 00:16:44.559
No need to jump in the river

00:16:45.179 --> 00:16:46.120
I'll testify for you

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:46.840
Teacher Liu

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:48.299
You didn't send me

00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:49.080
Right, I didn't

00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:50.220
Perhaps

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:54.320
Teacher Liu didn't order Professor Fan to steal it

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:55.620
Right

00:16:55.779 --> 00:16:56.659
Because

00:16:57.019 --> 00:16:59.620
if Teacher Liu ordered Professor Fan to steal it

00:16:59.679 --> 00:17:02.000
it would mean giving Professor Fan

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.580
massive leverage over her

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:07.460
leaving her forever under his control

00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:09.579
So it's more likely that

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.859
Teacher Liu stole it herself

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.099
Preposterous

00:17:58.559 --> 00:17:59.420
Absurd

00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:01.039
Ridiculous

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:03.400
I'm furious

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:05.559
Zhu Zhu

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:07.160
Listen to me explain

00:18:07.599 --> 00:18:08.539
These past few days, I...

00:18:08.759 --> 00:18:09.980
I never even...

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:13.019
...entered Grandma Jin's room

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.660
I mean, these messy conclusions of yours...

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.420
where did you come up with them?

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:18.059
Exactly

00:18:18.359 --> 00:18:19.220
Relying on this

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:23.400
Deduced by the little grey matter cells

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.359
Nonsense

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.700
It's all wild guessing

00:18:26.079 --> 00:18:27.579
You guys are the real suspects!

00:18:27.579 --> 00:18:28.140
Right

00:18:28.279 --> 00:18:29.319
Before you guys came...

00:18:29.359 --> 00:18:30.299
...at our Evergreen Residence...

00:18:30.299 --> 00:18:31.660
...when has anything like this ever happened?

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:32.559
Right? Isn't that so?

00:18:32.559 --> 00:18:33.440
Aren't you...

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.900
...the biggest suspects?

00:18:36.359 --> 00:18:37.420
What are you doing?

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.579
Didn't we agree not to get worked up?

00:18:40.099 --> 00:18:40.900
At first...

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.900
we also started investigating ourselves

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.160
But after checking over and over...

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.059
...we found none of them were it

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:47.039
So what could we do?

00:18:47.039 --> 00:18:49.779
We had to place righteousness above seniority...

00:18:49.819 --> 00:18:50.799
show no favoritism...

00:18:50.819 --> 00:18:52.700
and go after the grandpas and grandmas

00:18:52.819 --> 00:18:53.859
Let me say a few words

00:18:53.859 --> 00:18:55.059
This is just too infuriating

00:18:57.779 --> 00:18:59.559
I have a question for everyone

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:02.099
Is there anyone

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.720
who has truly seen

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.140
Grandma Jin's bracelet?

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.180
No.

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:06.559
No.

00:19:06.559 --> 00:19:07.519
I haven't seen it.

00:19:07.519 --> 00:19:08.559
I haven't seen it either.

00:19:08.859 --> 00:19:11.059
It seems Xiaofang has seen it.

00:19:12.079 --> 00:19:12.619
Right.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.420
I have seen this bracelet...

00:19:15.279 --> 00:19:16.380
...in a photo.

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.220
Why didn't you say so earlier?

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:18.940
Exactly.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.319
So after all this talk,

00:19:21.519 --> 00:19:24.079
not a single person has actually seen this bracelet.

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:25.920
So I think,

00:19:26.259 --> 00:19:27.680
it's very likely that Grandma Jin

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.480
doesn't have this bracelet at all.

00:19:31.019 --> 00:19:31.920
This bracelet

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:33.000
is just her...

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.539
turning her imagination

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:35.759
into reality.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.859
So what do we do?

00:19:39.039 --> 00:19:40.839
We can't invite the police

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.900
to interrogate her, right?

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:43.819
Right, exactly.

00:19:43.819 --> 00:19:45.240
And the old lady cares about face,

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.180
she won't admit it no matter what.

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:47.519
I have an idea.

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.140
Um...

00:19:49.859 --> 00:19:51.700
But it's a lousy idea.

00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:55.019
I'm sorry.

00:19:55.059 --> 00:19:56.460
Grandma Jin.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.920
I was confused for a moment

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.700
and stole your bracelet.

00:20:01.119 --> 00:20:02.200
I shouldn't have

00:20:02.339 --> 00:20:04.019
been blinded by greed.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.140
I was young and ignorant,

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:08.339
and morally corrupt.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:11.700
You...

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:12.200
Child...

00:20:12.279 --> 00:20:13.000
You just...

00:20:13.059 --> 00:20:14.500
You just admitted it like that?

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:16.980
Yes.

00:20:17.619 --> 00:20:19.259
After we found out he stole it,

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:21.299
we immediately started a surprise interrogation.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.400
We didn't let him sleep.

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:23.240
We didn't let him drink water.

00:20:23.319 --> 00:20:24.220
We didn't let him eat.

00:20:24.319 --> 00:20:25.380
The last one was the most effective.

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:26.500
He confessed right away.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:28.259
Children...

00:20:28.259 --> 00:20:31.599
You are forcing a confession!

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.400
Let Grandma take a look at you, child.

00:20:35.619 --> 00:20:37.720
You've suffered a grievance.

00:20:39.279 --> 00:20:41.200
It's all Grandma's fault.

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:42.779
No.

00:20:43.019 --> 00:20:43.880
Actually...

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:45.779
Grandma's bracelet...

00:20:45.839 --> 00:20:46.779
It simply...

00:20:49.279 --> 00:20:50.799
It simply wasn't lost.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:56.059
Then where did you get this bracelet from?

00:20:56.779 --> 00:20:58.460
I bought it at a street stall.

00:20:59.619 --> 00:21:01.500
It's made from a fine-comb frame.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.319
Children...

00:21:06.539 --> 00:21:07.940
Actually, Grandma...

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:10.420
just wanted...

00:21:10.579 --> 00:21:12.519
to chat with you all.

00:21:12.519 --> 00:21:13.779
To talk.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.579
But you all...

00:21:15.759 --> 00:21:17.859
always find me long-winded.

00:21:18.059 --> 00:21:21.160
You don't like listening to my stories about the palace.

00:21:21.519 --> 00:21:22.220
So I...

00:21:23.119 --> 00:21:24.180
So I thought...

00:21:24.279 --> 00:21:26.500
I'd say I lost my stuff.

00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:29.440
That way you'd all have to come, right?

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:30.740
You'd all have to...

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.000
chat with me for a while.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.640
Grandma has sinned, child.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:42.619
Grandma.

00:21:42.819 --> 00:21:45.140
We should tell you the truth too.

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.079
Zhu Zhu wasn't tortured.

00:21:48.779 --> 00:21:50.359
We were tricking you too.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.279
We also apologize to you.

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:54.180
Grandma, sorry.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.240
Sorry.

00:21:55.359 --> 00:21:56.079
Grandma Jin.

00:21:56.359 --> 00:21:57.799
If you want to chat in the future,

00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.859
just press this bell anytime.

00:22:00.099 --> 00:22:01.400
We'll be there whenever you call.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.559
We can chat about anything.

00:22:09.259 --> 00:22:10.619
Children...

00:22:10.859 --> 00:22:12.619
With these words from you,

00:22:12.759 --> 00:22:15.039
with this kindness from you,

00:22:15.299 --> 00:22:17.200
Grandma is content.

00:22:18.559 --> 00:22:19.400
Good.
