WEBVTT

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.239
Coming.

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:02.540
Professor.

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:03.640
Xiao Cai.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.659
You scared me to death yesterday.

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:07.060
If I hadn't learned...

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.780
some simple first aid back in the day.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.900
You call that simple first aid?

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.939
Good grief.

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:14.300
It was like a hex wrench and pliers.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.340
Pinching my philtrum...

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.139
nearly pried my front teeth off.

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:17.939
Sorry.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.219
But if I didn't use force, you wouldn't wake up.

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:21.039
That's true.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.740
But wait.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.539
The stock went up.

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:25.020
What were you shouting about?

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.659
I was really shocked too.

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.819
In the morning...

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:29.939
we just bought the stock...

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:31.979
and by afternoon it was up ten percent!

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:33.219
How could I not shout?

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:35.099
You're incredibly lucky.

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:35.659
You...

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:37.020
shouldn't be buying stocks.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.340
You should buy lottery tickets.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.099
Here.

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.699
This is the one thousand yuan profit.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.860
You take it first.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.180
Later I'll have Xiao Qian...

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.099
bring the principal back over.

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:47.099
Great. We'll just...

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.120
stop right here.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.020
That's great.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.979
What's so great about it?

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:52.300
Happiness has just begun.

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:54.180
How can we stop now?

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.860
No way.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:55.659
Absolutely not.

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:57.539
Do me a favor...

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:58.780
keep helping me trade.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.180
Keep trading?

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:01.180
I wouldn't dare.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.219
If someone dies...

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:03.500
I can't take the responsibility.

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:06.500
Wasn't that just because...

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:08.659
it was my first time fainting?

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:09.659
I promise.

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.819
From now on, let the stock soar like crazy.

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:12.740
Let it skyrocket.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.639
No matter how high, I won't faint.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.939
How high it goes...

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.620
is that up to me?

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:20.060
You don't have the say.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.060
Who calls the shots?

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.759
Honestly.

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:24.020
Professor, my brother.

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:26.060
I've figured it all out.

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:27.539
This one thousand yuan...

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:28.319
Five hundred yuan...

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:29.099
is for you.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.979
And this five hundred is for my grandson.

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:32.620
Why does that sound so awkward?

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:33.539
I don't want this money.

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:34.419
Not a single cent.

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:35.620
Give it all to your grandson.

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:37.379
That sounds awkward to me too.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:38.500
Take it.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.259
I don't want it.

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:40.819
I really... I can't take a cent.

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:41.159
Take it.

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.979
I say... honestly.

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:42.960
I really don't want it.

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:44.020
You think it's too little, right?

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.560
Fine.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:45.659
Then this...

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.060
This one thousand yuan...

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:48.340
You take it all.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.060
That's not what I meant. We'll earn more.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.139
I really don't want it. We'll earn more.

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:51.180
Please don't do this.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.099
Men and women shouldn't touch.

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.740
Let's not do this, okay?

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:53.139
No touching.

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:54.539
Why are you holding on so tight?

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:56.139
No, this... I can't take your...

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:56.900
You two...

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.340
You two... I didn't see anything.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.379
I didn't see a thing.

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:01.240
I'm just looking.

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:02.060
Don't.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.460
Don't say you didn't see anything!

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.259
Ms. Liu.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.580
Look closely.

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:07.180
What we're doing here...

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.580
what are we doing?

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.120
This...

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.939
We're...

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:11.120
We're exercising, right?

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:11.680
We're...

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.280
practicing...

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:13.219
Push Hands.

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:13.919
Right.

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:15.060
Push Hands.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.819
Just like this.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.100
Push.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:17.740
Right.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:18.899
Pushing back and forth.

00:04:24.459 --> 00:04:25.379
Mutton hotpot?

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.899
That works.

00:04:27.019 --> 00:04:28.060
Everyone's here.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:29.980
Have some candy.

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:34.420
Where did the sun rise from today?

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.540
Ms. Cai has become so generous.

00:04:36.579 --> 00:04:37.899
What are you saying?

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:41.060
I'm not generous every day.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.699
No.

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:43.899
I can't be generous every day.

00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:44.699
I...

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:45.540
Just eat your candy.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.540
Ms. Cai isn't just giving out candy.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.339
She bought new clothes too.

00:04:50.579 --> 00:04:52.420
She looks forty years younger.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.500
You noticed.

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:55.839
I bought this at the mall on sale.

00:04:56.019 --> 00:04:57.339
Thirty yuan a piece.

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:57.899
Is it worth it?

00:04:57.899 --> 00:04:58.980
Worth it. Definitely.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.060
That's why Old Cai is so good at managing money.

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:03.800
Buying up all these clearance items at once.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.459
Shoo.

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:06.160
These aren't clearance items.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.819
This schoolbag is for my grandson.

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:08.779
It cost over a hundred.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.540
This pencil case was over seventy.

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:11.779
This tracksuit...

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:13.899
...was two hundred even after twenty percent off.

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:15.300
Ms. Cai.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:16.920
For a child...

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.100
...to use such expensive things...

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.199
...isn't good for cultivating...

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:20.779
...a style of hard work and plain living.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.939
Boss Li.

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:26.899
His grandma has lived hard her whole life.

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:28.459
Lived plainly for most of it.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.540
Now for my grandson's generation...

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:31.459
...still plain?

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.740
It's time for a change.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.899
You guys chat.

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:35.100
Old Fan, come here.

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:36.420
Candy Ms. Cai bought.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.019
Hold on.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.819
How can Professor Fan eat candy?

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:42.899
I bought chocolate especially for you.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.899
Silky as satin.

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:45.980
Why?

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.740
We can only eat fruit candy...

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.600
...but Professor Fan...

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:50.540
...gets to eat "satin"?

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.459
Is eating satin appropriate?

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.699
He's eating choc...

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.160
Right, why does he get to eat chocolate?

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.060
Of course he can eat chocolate.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.620
Because Professor Fan...

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.379
...he didn't do anything.

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:03.939
Here.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.019
Eat up.

00:06:05.019 --> 00:06:06.699
Wait, if he didn't do anything...

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:07.579
...he gets chocolate?

00:06:07.579 --> 00:06:09.259
We didn't do anything either.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.579
Can we compare?

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.139
That is chocolate.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.620
It has special meaning.

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:14.540
Ms. Liu.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.779
What's special about it?

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:16.860
Let's all eat together.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:17.579
No.

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:18.579
We won't eat it.

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.100
If you won't eat it, I will.

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:36.620
Old Fan

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.339
Why are you up so early today?

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.899
That's right

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.600
Starting today,

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:44.279
I'm going to start exercising too

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:46.339
You see,

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.300
under my influence and leadership,

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:49.980
Professor Fan, who usually stays up all night

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.300
and never gets up in the morning,

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.360
has finally gotten up early to exercise

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:55.740
Tell me,

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.860
how should you thank me?

00:06:58.139 --> 00:06:59.579
Thank you for what?

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.019
Look at you

00:07:01.459 --> 00:07:02.420
You're always like this

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.459
Always the same

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:04.800
Only I,

00:07:05.019 --> 00:07:05.839
being the bigger person,

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:06.920
won't hold it against you

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:08.339
How about this?

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:09.699
I'll take you on as a disciple

00:07:10.019 --> 00:07:11.220
We can skip the initiation ceremony

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:12.980
You don't even have to pay tuition

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.660
How about I teach you Yang-style Tai Chi first?

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.100
Yang-style?

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.379
My mother was also called Yang Shi when she was young

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:20.819
I should be the one teaching you this style

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:22.180
What do you mean you teach me?

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:23.060
Honestly

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:24.079
Where are you going?

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:25.899
It's a secret. I'm not telling you

00:07:25.899 --> 00:07:26.819
A secret, huh?

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.379
Didn't we agree

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.019
to meet at the waterside pavilion?

00:07:31.779 --> 00:07:32.560
Little Cai is here

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:33.259
Professor

00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:33.980
Boss Li

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:34.740
You're both here

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.079
Fried dough sticks, milk, eggs

00:07:38.339 --> 00:07:39.779
Piping hot. Just bought from the cafeteria

00:07:39.779 --> 00:07:40.980
Still hot

00:07:41.019 --> 00:07:42.339
Boss Li, you haven't had breakfast yet, right?

00:07:42.339 --> 00:07:43.060
Not yet

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.220
You should hurry and go eat

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.879
Otherwise, the fried dough sticks will get soggy

00:07:47.139 --> 00:07:47.980
These fried dough sticks are just right

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:48.259
I...

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:50.779
I actually wanted to buy a portion for you too

00:07:50.779 --> 00:07:51.860
But then I thought,

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.819
you always have that...

00:07:53.819 --> 00:07:55.699
finish exercising before eating breakfast

00:07:55.699 --> 00:07:56.339
Right? Yes

00:07:56.339 --> 00:07:57.779
That is your good lifestyle habit

00:07:57.779 --> 00:07:58.579
I shouldn't break it

00:07:58.579 --> 00:07:59.220
Don't you agree?

00:07:59.220 --> 00:07:59.980
That is true

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:01.220
Why haven't you gone

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.100
to practice that Tai Chi yet?

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.000
I was just about to go

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:04.779
Chop-chop

00:08:04.779 --> 00:08:05.600
Hurry up

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.160
Look at the time!

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:07.879
Hurry up

00:08:09.779 --> 00:08:11.699
I know what the secret is

00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:18.500
What do you know?

00:08:18.579 --> 00:08:19.839
Come over and eat.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:22.300
While it's hot.

00:08:23.339 --> 00:08:24.300
Look at you.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.620
You won't take a commission.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.019
You won't let me make your bed.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.500
I have no way to repay you.

00:08:31.779 --> 00:08:33.139
So I thought, might as well...

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:34.899
Every morning,

00:08:34.899 --> 00:08:36.179
I'll buy you breakfast.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.059
Fried dough sticks.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:39.460
Bread.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:40.700
Eggs, milk.

00:08:40.779 --> 00:08:41.940
Guaranteed variety.

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:42.940
Whatever you like to eat,

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:44.039
I will buy for you.

00:08:44.259 --> 00:08:45.580
What I like to eat...

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.759
Is whatever's bad for my health.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:47.659
Forget it.

00:08:47.659 --> 00:08:48.779
Don't buy things for me anymore.

00:08:48.779 --> 00:08:50.159
I have to go practice my Tai Chi sword.

00:08:50.159 --> 00:08:50.820
Don't.

00:08:51.179 --> 00:08:53.100
Don't go practice Tai Chi sword.

00:08:53.179 --> 00:08:54.500
Come, sit down.

00:08:55.419 --> 00:08:56.899
You haven't told me yet.

00:08:57.019 --> 00:08:59.700
Which stock are we buying today?

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.539
Good heavens.

00:09:01.539 --> 00:09:02.580
Comrade Cai Xiaoying.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:03.620
I'll make a call right now.

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.379
To get your money back and return it to you.

00:09:05.779 --> 00:09:06.659
You, all day long...

00:09:06.659 --> 00:09:08.779
Chasing and pestering me like this.

00:09:08.779 --> 00:09:10.299
I really can't take it anymore.

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:11.419
Don't.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.059
Don't be angry.

00:09:13.059 --> 00:09:14.740
Great Professor Fan.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.240
Isn't it the money urging me on?

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:19.539
How about this.

00:09:19.539 --> 00:09:22.179
You just teach me how to trade stocks.

00:09:22.179 --> 00:09:22.940
Okay?

00:09:23.059 --> 00:09:24.299
Isn't there that...

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.080
Was it...

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.620
Confucius or Laozi...

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.179
Or Sunzi who said that...

00:09:29.179 --> 00:09:30.179
That famous quote.

00:09:30.659 --> 00:09:31.779
If you want to eat fish,

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.100
You have to know how to swim, right?

00:09:34.139 --> 00:09:35.740
You want to go into the river to catch fish?

00:09:36.179 --> 00:09:39.980
It's "Give a man a fish; teach a man to fish."

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:40.940
It means...

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.259
Giving you a fish...

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:42.899
Is not as good as...

00:09:42.899 --> 00:09:43.620
Giving me two fish.

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:44.159
Right.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:45.460
What do you mean "right"?

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.740
What two fish?

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:47.659
It means...

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.500
It's better to teach you how to fish.

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.299
That's exactly what I meant.

00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:52.940
So hurry up and teach me to fish.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:54.179
Why would I learn to fish?

00:09:54.179 --> 00:09:56.620
Hurry up and teach me to trade stocks.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.940
Look, how about this.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.460
You take me to that stock factory.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:01.659
Let's go look around.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:02.659
Take a look.

00:10:03.259 --> 00:10:03.779
Learn a bit.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.220
Then I'll know how to trade stocks.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.299
And I won't have to bother you every day.

00:10:08.779 --> 00:10:10.019
That is true.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:12.500
I've agreed.

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:13.740
One last time.

00:10:18.539 --> 00:10:19.840
Our Professor Fan,

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.120
is living the good life recently.

00:10:23.019 --> 00:10:25.100
He has personal service for food and water.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.100
Making his bed, folding his quilt.

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.139
A fitness partner for push-hands.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.220
Plus dating.

00:10:32.059 --> 00:10:34.039
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:36.940
He's just being shy.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:37.659
Look.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:39.179
Ms. Liu.

00:10:39.379 --> 00:10:41.100
You have no idea.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.299
When an old house catches fire,

00:10:43.299 --> 00:10:44.539
there's no saving it.

00:10:44.779 --> 00:10:46.139
Isn't that what I told you?

00:10:46.139 --> 00:10:48.259
It's from Qian Zhongshu's novel, Fortress Besieged.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.059
So you admit it then?

00:10:51.379 --> 00:10:52.980
This is a great thing!

00:10:53.299 --> 00:10:55.259
Looks like we'll be switching rooms soon.

00:10:55.259 --> 00:10:56.220
There's no rush.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:57.779
What do you mean?

00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.220
Who's switching rooms with whom?

00:10:59.779 --> 00:11:00.620
Professor Fan.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.139
I'm ready.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:03.340
Let's go.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.940
Do I even need to say who?

00:11:05.379 --> 00:11:06.179
Cai Xiaoying.

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.860
Professor Fan has been waiting for you for ages.

00:11:09.059 --> 00:11:11.019
Where are you two going today?

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:11.980
What do you mean "you two"?

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.139
I'm not going anywhere.

00:11:14.899 --> 00:11:16.220
Didn't we agree on this earlier?

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.379
You can't go back on your word.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.379
It was all settled, right?

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:22.820
We can't be fickle and heartless.

00:11:22.899 --> 00:11:24.539
And act like a scumbag.

00:11:25.139 --> 00:11:25.940
A scumbag.

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:27.139
Right, a scumbag.

00:11:28.059 --> 00:11:29.659
Who's a scumbag? Who?

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:30.860
Let me tell you.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.340
I'm taking Little Cai to see...

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.039
See a movie.

00:11:33.399 --> 00:11:34.600
Professor Fan said he'd take me to see...

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:35.799
That's not it at all.

00:11:36.379 --> 00:11:37.779
I'm not going to see a movie.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:38.899
Professor Fan.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.019
Whether you see a movie or not...

00:11:40.019 --> 00:11:41.779
...what does that have to do with us?

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.539
Is there any need to explain to us?

00:11:43.779 --> 00:11:45.000
Right, Ms. Liu?

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:45.899
That's right.

00:11:46.139 --> 00:11:47.740
Anyway, since you've made plans...

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.019
You should get going.

00:11:49.059 --> 00:11:50.659
Or the movie will start without you.

00:11:50.659 --> 00:11:52.139
It really has nothing to do with a movie.

00:11:52.139 --> 00:11:53.620
I really have to explain this to you.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.940
No need to explain anymore.

00:11:55.019 --> 00:11:56.259
Any later and the stock mark...

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.580
...the story film will start.

00:11:58.899 --> 00:12:00.740
I'll explain to you later, Ms. Liu.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:01.919
Honestly.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:04.659
Things have gone this far...

00:12:04.659 --> 00:12:05.580
...and he still wants to explain.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:06.700
Explain what?

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.179
What is there to be afraid of?

00:12:08.539 --> 00:12:09.700
Don't we seniors...

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.220
...have emotional lives too?

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:12.700
Are you saying...

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.220
Professor Fan and Auntie Cai...

00:12:16.059 --> 00:12:17.179
No way.

00:12:17.539 --> 00:12:18.659
Why not?

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:20.659
A single man and a single woman.

00:12:21.139 --> 00:12:22.460
A talented man and a beauty...

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.179
...though she's not exactly a beauty...

00:12:24.659 --> 00:12:26.100
...but there are no obstacles.

00:12:27.059 --> 00:12:28.139
What I mean is...

00:12:28.379 --> 00:12:30.779
A retired professor and a laid-off worker.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.419
Isn't the gap a bit too wide?

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:35.179
What's wrong with a wide gap?

00:12:35.899 --> 00:12:37.460
I was a poor boy back in the day.

00:12:37.899 --> 00:12:39.500
I fell in love with a capitalist's daughter.

00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:42.379
Didn't I still manage to win her over?

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.500
That was during extraordinary times.

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:47.100
There are plenty of examples from ancient times too.

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:48.139
For example...

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.620
Dong Yong and the Seventh Fairy.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.539
A poor boy...

00:12:52.539 --> 00:12:53.659
...and a fairy.

00:12:54.379 --> 00:12:55.659
One plows the fields...

00:12:55.659 --> 00:12:56.899
...the other weaves cloth.

00:12:57.059 --> 00:12:58.139
It didn't affect anything.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:12:59.299
And then there's...

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:00.860
Zhuge Liang and Huang Yueying.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:02.500
One was a viral heartthrob...

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:03.779
...and the other was famously plain.

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:05.820
Didn't they still make it work?

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:07.419
And also...

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:08.940
Xu Xian and Lady White Snake.

00:13:09.179 --> 00:13:10.500
Zhu Bajie and Gao Cuilan.

00:13:11.059 --> 00:13:12.779
Tuxingsun and Deng Chanyu.

00:13:13.779 --> 00:13:15.139
Chen Shimei and Qin Xianglian.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:16.820
They all had big gaps between them.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.500
But the examples you just mentioned...

00:13:19.179 --> 00:13:21.220
...didn't seem to end very well.

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.059
That's an after-sales issue.

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.620
It has nothing to do with us.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.299
As long as there's a spark...

00:13:27.659 --> 00:13:29.299
...anything can happen.

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.100
Look at Professor Fan and Little Cai.

00:13:31.179 --> 00:13:32.899
So we should all support them.

00:13:32.899 --> 00:13:33.740
Help them out.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.460
How are we supposed to help?

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:36.639
In our volunteer handbook...

00:13:36.639 --> 00:13:37.720
...there's no service for this.

00:13:38.899 --> 00:13:40.179
Everyone, let's take action.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.740
Notify everyone.

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.460
Create every opportunity for them.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:44.899
Let them be together as much as possible.

00:13:45.139 --> 00:13:46.000
Boss Li.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.539
Why are you so enthusiastic about this?

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:50.440
Isn't this just me...

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:53.100
...finding joy in helping others?

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.139
It's pure.

00:13:58.139 --> 00:13:59.240
Right, pure.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.120
Xiao Cai

00:14:02.379 --> 00:14:03.019
You're back.

00:14:03.539 --> 00:14:05.100
How was the movie?

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.460
We really didn't go to the movies.

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:07.220
Professor Fan.

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:08.419
We're done eating.

00:14:08.419 --> 00:14:09.419
We'll make room for you.

00:14:09.419 --> 00:14:10.500
You two take your time.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.179
Okay.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:11.820
Let's go.

00:14:11.899 --> 00:14:12.799
Don't go.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.399
All of you...

00:14:14.399 --> 00:14:15.080
Don't leave, everyone.

00:14:15.399 --> 00:14:15.639
Wait...

00:14:15.639 --> 00:14:16.080
We're done eating.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:16.799
We've finished our meal.

00:14:16.799 --> 00:14:18.100
Don't go, everyone.

00:14:18.759 --> 00:14:19.179
Let them go.

00:14:19.179 --> 00:14:20.259
Just let them go.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:21.240
Professor Fan.

00:14:22.179 --> 00:14:23.500
About the market K-lines...

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.080
You still have to explain it to me.

00:14:25.179 --> 00:14:26.240
Don't explain!

00:14:27.059 --> 00:14:28.720
I can't even explain myself clearly now.

00:14:28.899 --> 00:14:30.460
What are you afraid of?

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:31.980
Worst case, tonight back in the room...

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.980
I'll explain it directly to Ms. Liu.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:34.700
On your behalf.

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.340
Mom, there you are.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:38.820
I've been looking for you all afternoon.

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.299
What are you doing here, kid?

00:14:41.299 --> 00:14:42.460
Have you eaten yet?

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:43.179
I have.

00:14:43.259 --> 00:14:44.000
Listen...

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:45.980
Did that little fox...

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:46.960
...kick you out again?

00:14:47.179 --> 00:14:48.940
Mom, look at you, as soon as you open your mouth...

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.460
My wife's name is Hu Xiaoli.

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:52.659
I'm talking about Hu Xiaoli.

00:14:52.659 --> 00:14:54.340
You just said "little fox."

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:55.039
Fine.

00:14:55.299 --> 00:14:55.919
What's the matter?

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:56.779
The thing is...

00:14:57.539 --> 00:14:58.820
Just this afternoon...

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.220
Our little fox...

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.179
Hu Xiaoli.

00:15:02.179 --> 00:15:03.799
It's all your fault, I'm confused.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:04.899
My wife...

00:15:04.899 --> 00:15:06.779
...was washing clothes for our Doudou.

00:15:06.779 --> 00:15:07.740
Guess what?

00:15:07.899 --> 00:15:09.340
From inside the kid's pocket...

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:10.820
...she found five hundred yuan.

00:15:11.179 --> 00:15:12.620
She asked him where the money came from.

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:14.379
He insisted you gave it to him.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:15.519
At such a young age...

00:15:15.519 --> 00:15:17.059
...he's already learned to lie.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:17.980
I did give it to him.

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:19.419
You gave it?

00:15:20.139 --> 00:15:21.740
How is that possible, Mom?

00:15:21.779 --> 00:15:23.259
How much rent do you collect a month?

00:15:23.259 --> 00:15:24.500
Don't I know it?

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:27.419
After paying the odds and ends for this retirement community...

00:15:27.419 --> 00:15:28.580
...there's barely anything left.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:29.820
I really did give it to him.

00:15:30.179 --> 00:15:31.259
Mom, you...

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:33.539
...can't protect the calf like this.

00:15:33.779 --> 00:15:35.019
You darn kid.

00:15:35.179 --> 00:15:36.980
Who calls their own son a calf?

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:38.779
Let me tell you.

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:41.100
Mom's income is limited.

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.080
But this money, I have.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.059
If you don't believe me...

00:15:45.139 --> 00:15:46.220
...ask Professor Fan.

00:15:47.399 --> 00:15:48.460
Ask me?

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:49.899
Right.

00:15:50.419 --> 00:15:51.620
Mom, who is this?

00:15:52.059 --> 00:15:53.259
Let me introduce you.

00:15:53.899 --> 00:15:54.700
This gentleman...

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.059
...is our Evergreen Residence's...

00:15:56.059 --> 00:15:58.200
...most respected Professor Fan.

00:15:58.580 --> 00:15:59.980
Call him Uncle Fan.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:01.580
Hello, Uncle Fan.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:02.259
Hello.

00:16:02.899 --> 00:16:04.539
That five hundred yuan for Doudou...

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:05.899
...was given to me by him.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:07.779
I gave it?

00:16:09.419 --> 00:16:10.220
That's right

00:16:10.659 --> 00:16:11.620
It amounts to me giving it

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:12.419
You gave it

00:16:12.419 --> 00:16:14.059
I really have to thank you for this

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:15.940
That's not right

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.179
Why would you give my mom money for no reason?

00:16:18.179 --> 00:16:18.940
I am

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:19.659
Is it

00:16:19.659 --> 00:16:20.159
No

00:16:20.379 --> 00:16:21.539
It wasn't me, right?

00:16:21.539 --> 00:16:22.779
What is it... it's just me

00:16:22.779 --> 00:16:23.820
It... the thing is

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:24.740
Exactly

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:26.259
Uncle Fan

00:16:26.259 --> 00:16:27.740
You think Mom looks cute

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:28.659
No

00:16:28.779 --> 00:16:30.620
You think Doudou looks cute

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:31.460
And then?

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.659
You asked Doudou to give Mom pocket money

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:34.340
No

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.860
You asked Mom to give Doudou pocket money

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.120
Now you understand, right?

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:39.460
I'm even more confused

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:40.980
I'd better sort this out myself

00:16:41.379 --> 00:16:42.299
It's like this

00:16:42.379 --> 00:16:44.740
You think my mom looks cute

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.299
So you gave her five hundred yuan

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:47.940
That's inappropriate

00:16:48.419 --> 00:16:49.139
It's like this

00:16:49.139 --> 00:16:49.980
It was you

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.940
You think our Doudou looks cute

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.659
So you gave my mom five hundred yuan

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:55.700
Anyway, I...

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:56.740
My brain is a bit slow

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:59.340
I feel something is wrong here

00:16:59.419 --> 00:17:00.220
What's wrong?

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:01.220
What could be wrong?

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.379
Why are you so troublesome, child?

00:17:02.379 --> 00:17:04.119
Knowing I gave the money is enough, isn't it?

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:04.480
Hurry up

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.339
Go home

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:06.700
Tell that little vixen

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:07.799
Don't wrongly accuse my grandson

00:17:08.539 --> 00:17:09.539
You said it again

00:17:09.539 --> 00:17:10.420
Uncle Fan, did you hear that?

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:11.380
She said it again

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:12.720
What did I say?

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:13.440
You said

00:17:13.519 --> 00:17:14.319
Little vixen

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:14.859
Go

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:19.500
Little Cai

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.819
Isn't it tiring hiding things from everyone?

00:17:22.019 --> 00:17:23.819
Just tell the truth and be done with it

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:26.059
I really can't tell

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.740
If the little vixen knows I have money to trade stocks

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:32.460
Who knows what kind of trouble she'll stir up

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:33.619
I don't even dare to think about it

00:17:34.859 --> 00:17:36.220
Even an upright official can't settle family quarrels

00:17:36.299 --> 00:17:36.759
You...

00:17:36.759 --> 00:17:38.839
Hurry and explain to Ms. Liu for me

00:17:39.019 --> 00:17:39.539
Okay

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:40.380
No

00:17:41.619 --> 00:17:43.140
My mind is a mess right now

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:44.539
I have to go home for a bit

00:17:44.779 --> 00:17:46.880
I can't let my grandson suffer any grievance

00:17:48.299 --> 00:17:49.980
Then what if I suffer a grievance?

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:50.799
You

00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:58.980
Little Cai

00:17:59.619 --> 00:18:00.460
It's enough that you came

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:01.700
Why did you bring gifts?

00:18:02.859 --> 00:18:03.660
Boss Li

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:05.460
I have some business with Professor Fan

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.440
Please excuse us for a moment

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:09.700
Fine

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:10.559
Fine

00:18:12.059 --> 00:18:12.859
Old Fan

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:16.500
You're not far from changing rooms now

00:18:27.819 --> 00:18:28.740
Xiao Cai.

00:18:29.059 --> 00:18:30.619
Let's not do this, okay?

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.299
I have to do this!

00:18:32.299 --> 00:18:33.299
My dear Professor.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.140
Hurry up and check today's stock market prices.

00:18:36.299 --> 00:18:38.259
My stock has dropped.

00:18:39.779 --> 00:18:40.339
Well...

00:18:40.339 --> 00:18:42.079
It's normal for it to drop.

00:18:43.099 --> 00:18:45.259
That's my coffin money!

00:18:45.579 --> 00:18:48.200
Why don't you call and ask?

00:18:48.579 --> 00:18:49.299
Don't panic.

00:18:49.299 --> 00:18:51.099
I'll call.

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:52.500
Okay, I know.

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:53.299
I know.

00:18:57.299 --> 00:18:58.579
Hello, Xiao Qian.

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.140
I just wanted to ask you...

00:19:01.299 --> 00:19:03.779
About that stock you recommended...

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:05.460
What?

00:19:06.859 --> 00:19:08.579
I didn't... Hey, don't faint!

00:19:09.559 --> 00:19:10.359
Go on.

00:19:15.299 --> 00:19:16.859
Okay, I got it.

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:18.579
I know, I know.

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:22.099
So, Xiao Cai...

00:19:22.259 --> 00:19:22.819
Well, you...

00:19:22.819 --> 00:19:23.559
You...

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.059
Steady your emotions.

00:19:25.059 --> 00:19:25.700
Find a place to sit.

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:26.279
Just sit down.

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:27.480
Let's not rush.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:31.779
You...

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:32.900
What are you looking for?

00:19:33.099 --> 00:19:35.579
I'm looking for where Old Li keeps his nitroglycerin.

00:19:36.579 --> 00:19:37.599
Of course, I'm not saying...

00:19:37.599 --> 00:19:39.500
That you'll definitely have a heart attack.

00:19:40.299 --> 00:19:41.099
By the way, Xiao Cai.

00:19:41.099 --> 00:19:43.299
Do you have a history of heart disease? Do you?

00:19:43.299 --> 00:19:43.940
No.

00:19:44.579 --> 00:19:46.460
This time, you might just get it.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:47.539
I...

00:19:47.859 --> 00:19:48.619
Professor Fan.

00:19:48.619 --> 00:19:50.140
Just tell me straight.

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:51.220
My stock...

00:19:53.099 --> 00:19:53.900
It's fine.

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:54.920
Really.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:56.619
No big problem.

00:19:57.339 --> 00:19:59.980
Just a tiny little fluctuation.

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:00.980
It's nothing.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:02.180
Don't worry.

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:05.259
That "tiny little fluctuation" you mentioned...

00:20:05.259 --> 00:20:06.180
Is...

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:07.180
How big is it?

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:08.420
It's just...

00:20:08.619 --> 00:20:09.220
There is...

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:10.019
A little bit of...

00:20:10.299 --> 00:20:11.819
Slight oscillation.

00:20:12.619 --> 00:20:14.299
Just a temporary dip.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:16.900
Causing some buyers...

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.220
To do a bit of panic selling.

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:20.740
Can you speak plain Chinese?

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:21.779
My ten thousand yuan...

00:20:21.779 --> 00:20:23.259
How much is actually left?

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:24.259
Well...

00:20:24.259 --> 00:20:24.880
Xiao Cai...

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:26.859
You must not pass out when you hear this.

00:20:27.019 --> 00:20:29.059
Investing in stocks always has gains and losses.

00:20:29.059 --> 00:20:29.779
Right?

00:20:29.859 --> 00:20:31.579
Although we are down temporarily...

00:20:31.579 --> 00:20:32.900
But we must...

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:34.259
Look into the distance.

00:20:34.819 --> 00:20:36.160
There is still poetry and the distance.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:36.779
You...

00:20:36.779 --> 00:20:37.660
Save the "distance" for later.

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:38.700
Let me look at the present first.

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:39.980
How much money do I have left?

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:42.440
If you right now...

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:43.619
Were to sell...

00:20:44.819 --> 00:20:46.019
There's over five thousand left.

00:20:52.779 --> 00:20:54.980
I lost over four thousand in one day?!

00:20:55.339 --> 00:20:56.819
Xiao Cai, you must be strong.

00:20:56.819 --> 00:20:58.220
You must not faint.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.220
You have to believe in the distance!

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:02.059
Here.

00:21:02.059 --> 00:21:02.480
Find...

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.079
Find what?

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:03.539
What?

00:21:04.019 --> 00:21:05.859
Boss Li's nitroglycerin.

00:21:14.539 --> 00:21:16.660
Xiao Cai, you must be strong.

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:18.059
Xiao Cai is...

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:19.299
What's wrong with her?

00:21:19.579 --> 00:21:20.380
Do you even have to ask?

00:21:20.779 --> 00:21:21.819
Heartless and unjust.

00:21:22.099 --> 00:21:23.059
To seduce and abandon.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.460
That Old Fan is simply outrageous.

00:21:25.579 --> 00:21:26.380
Scum.

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:28.180
You mean...

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:29.460
No.

00:21:30.259 --> 00:21:31.980
I need to have a good talk with that Fan guy.

00:21:32.619 --> 00:21:33.420
Boss Li.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.400
What's the situation?

00:21:37.799 --> 00:21:38.599
Sit down.

00:21:39.359 --> 00:21:40.160
Sit down.

00:21:43.079 --> 00:21:44.079
Let me tell you.

00:21:45.319 --> 00:21:47.160
You must adopt an honest attitude.

00:21:47.759 --> 00:21:49.119
And seriously confess your problems.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.480
Don't harbor any...

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:52.960
...illusions of slipping through.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:54.099
What th...

00:21:54.099 --> 00:21:55.059
Wha...

00:21:55.059 --> 00:21:55.839
What is this?

00:21:56.039 --> 00:21:57.000
What crime have I committed?

00:21:57.079 --> 00:21:58.119
Still trying to deny it?

00:21:59.359 --> 00:22:00.240
Be honest!

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.279
I'm telling you.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.599
If you want to be a heartless scoundrel...

00:22:05.359 --> 00:22:06.319
...then I am Justice Bao.

00:22:06.839 --> 00:22:08.400
If you want to be Zuoshandiao...

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.720
...then I am 203.

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.039
Then what if I'm Wu Qionghua?

00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:12.240
Then I am Nan Batian.

00:22:15.319 --> 00:22:16.359
You dare get cheeky?

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.240
Master.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:20.000
Taste your servant's bullet!

00:22:22.359 --> 00:22:23.319
Stop with the cheekiness.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.180
Grinning and joking with me here.

00:22:25.279 --> 00:22:26.240
Honestly confess your problems.

00:22:30.259 --> 00:22:31.059
Xiao Cai.

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:32.819
About Xiao Cai.

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:34.220
You...

00:22:34.619 --> 00:22:35.980
Why did you break faith?

00:22:36.619 --> 00:22:37.940
Why did you seduce and abandon her?

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:40.460
Since you made a promise to her...

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:41.960
...you should be responsible to the end.

00:22:42.559 --> 00:22:43.539
What's the big deal?

00:22:43.539 --> 00:22:44.740
At worst, I'll pay her back.

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:45.339
Silence!

00:22:46.259 --> 00:22:47.619
Do you think money is everything?

00:22:47.819 --> 00:22:48.539
Do you think...

00:22:48.539 --> 00:22:49.579
...money can buy...

00:22:49.579 --> 00:22:50.900
...a clear conscience?

00:22:52.119 --> 00:22:53.759
I just helped her trade stocks.

00:22:54.119 --> 00:22:55.039
Is this really necessary?

00:22:55.359 --> 00:22:57.720
What is all this nonsense you're talking about?

00:22:57.839 --> 00:22:58.700
Stock trading.

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:00.980
Stocks.

00:23:01.099 --> 00:23:01.940
What else?

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:06.079
Boring.

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:11.259
Xiao Cai.

00:23:12.579 --> 00:23:15.299
Trading stocks is a perfectly legitimate thing.

00:23:16.339 --> 00:23:17.700
Why hide it?

00:23:18.539 --> 00:23:20.859
Wasn't I afraid you'd criticize me?

00:23:21.299 --> 00:23:22.500
Am I that kind of person?

00:23:23.259 --> 00:23:24.180
Besides...

00:23:24.619 --> 00:23:26.059
...laughing when you make money in stocks...

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:27.819
...and crying when you lose money...

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.539
...how can you trade stocks with that mindset?

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.420
You see? You're criticizing me now.

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:33.720
I'm not just criticizing you.

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:35.619
I'm also going to help you.

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:36.779
Old Fan.

00:23:37.859 --> 00:23:39.380
I'll transfer twenty thousand to you right now.

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:40.339
To invest in the stock market.

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.220
I want to take the losses Xiao Cai suffered...

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:42.980
...and win them back!

00:23:43.299 --> 00:23:44.819
Oh my god, spare me, please!

00:23:45.779 --> 00:23:46.599
Okay.
