00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.560
What? You tired?

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.879
My dad.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.439
Asked me for money again.

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.239
That's a novelty.

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:07.400
We don't ask our dads for money...

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:08.599
No, wait a minute.

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:09.340
Who?

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.159
Who asked whom?

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:12.840
My dad asked me for money. 10,000 yuan.

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.080
Wait, what?

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.240
You haven't even graduated yet.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.560
You're already supporting the family?

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.520
Why should you?

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.080
I'm not even close with them.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.719
Wait, who aren't you close with?

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.280
My parents.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.840
I grew up with my grandma.

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:28.800
I've lived in dorms since I was little.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.479
I go to Grandma's for New Year's.

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:31.960
I don't see them once a year.

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:33.280
Not close.

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:35.039
Listen to this.

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:36.879
He says he and his parents aren't...

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.159
What's wrong?

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:41.719
He and his parents aren't what?

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:43.080
Aren't...

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.800
Aren't bad.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.800
Right?

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.960
He has a great relationship with his parents.

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:48.280
Isn't that how it should be?

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.759
Right.

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:51.039
My relationship with my parents is great too.

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:52.280
No matter what I do,

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.639
they always support and encourage me.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.719
My parents never have a nice word to say.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.919
Every time we meet,

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:01.199
it's either disapproval or criticism.

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:02.280
That's nothing.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.599
My dad beat me since I was little.

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:04.840
He'd grab whatever was handy,

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.039
and give me a thrashing.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.400
Stop chatting. Let's go.

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:08.240
Let's go.

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:11.000
Students!

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I was just looking for you.

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:13.240
Where are...

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.120
you going?

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.000
To decorate the room for Ms. Liu.

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:17.000
You know, right?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.039
Tomorrow is Ms. Liu's 65th birthday.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.240
That's exactly why I came to find you.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.759
For Ms. Liu's...

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:24.360
65th birthday party,

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.000
I have an idea.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.319
But I need everyone's cooperation.

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.719
Is that okay?

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:29.199
Sure.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.939
Follow me.

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:35.139
President Li

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.259
Professor Fan

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:37.180
Old Liang

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.419
Ms. Liu, come here!

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.099
Xiao Cai

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.939
Why are you back so early?

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.939
Look at you, all spruced up.

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:47.379
Did you go on a date?

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:48.099
Who?

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:49.539
Who went on a blind date?

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:50.180
It's...

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.740
Xiao Cai.

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:53.659
This is a major life event!

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:55.500
Your old friend here has to vet him for you.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.300
What?

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.139
What are you talking about?

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:59.580
She's been pure and chaste her whole life.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.979
What nonsense are you spouting?

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:02.340
Honestly, you are too much.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.460
What's the situation?

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.060
This little lady went to a banquet.

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:10.780
Today...

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.699
...was my grandson Doudou's...

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:14.139
...grand fifth birthday celebration.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.439
The spectacle! The scale of it!

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.180
Balloons, ribbons, cold fireworks.

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:24.899
Fish, meat, big lobsters.

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:26.079
Listen to that.

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:28.500
The key thing was that cake.

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:30.699
It had so many layers!

00:04:30.899 --> 00:04:32.300
I took one look, and oh my...

00:04:32.579 --> 00:04:34.339
If we can't finish it, it'll just go to waste.

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:35.899
Don't throw it away! What a pity.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.980
So I thought of you guys!

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:40.199
Come on.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.860
Wait, you described such a lively scene...

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.019
...just to give us the leftovers?

00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:45.060
Well, we can't just throw it away.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.939
We must uphold...

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.819
...the revolutionary tradition of thriftiness.

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:48.420
Here.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.740
You get this piece, it has a flower.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.459
Okay, this is mine.

00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:51.819
Old Li, it's so sweet.

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:53.100
Can you eat this with your diabetes?

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.339
What's there to be afraid of?

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:55.699
I'll take an Acarbose pill first.

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:57.100
Let the two of them fight it out in my stomach.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.300
Xiao Cai.

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:00.699
Look how filial your son is.

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:02.339
And you always call him an ingrate.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.060
Let me tell you the truth.

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:09.660
The birthday banquet, the dinner...

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.860
...transport, gifts, booking the hotel...

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.060
...I paid for it all out of my own pocket.

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:15.819
Why on earth?

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.019
Isn't that just...

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.500
...living off one's parents?

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:19.680
Let them do it.

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:21.500
I have to act as sweet as honey about it.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.579
I have to be eager to do it.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.100
The "little fox" in our family said...

00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:25.819
...if I don't let them live off me...

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:28.019
...then I can forget about seeing my grandson.

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:29.819
Look at that.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.899
What's the use of raising sons and daughters?

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.220
In the end...

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.740
...how many are truly close to their parents?

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:37.060
Close? Yeah, right.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.699
All day long, behind your back...

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:40.379
...they're just calculating your assets.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.779
Others raise children for old age security.

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:46.980
For me, I'm aging and have to guard against my son.

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:48.579
I'll have a piece.

00:05:48.579 --> 00:05:49.939
I'm starving to death.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.420
Ms. Liu.

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:05.100
It's rare for you and me to have such a chance...

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:06.300
...such a time...

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.939
...to stroll in this beautiful setting.

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:11.939
If you have something to say, please say it.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.220
I...

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.339
Actually...

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:18.420
Actually, it's nothing.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.259
Ms. Liu, let's sit down and talk.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.699
Let us rest our weary legs.

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:25.439
Okay.

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:34.459
How should I put this?

00:06:35.579 --> 00:06:37.100
Seeing Xiao Cai today...

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:40.139
...with a home, career, children, and grandchildren...

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.620
...so happy and harmonious.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.620
It really makes you think.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:49.740
Even Xiao Cai has to...

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:51.420
guard against her son in her old age.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.379
And yet they seem so happy together.

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:57.060
Anyway,

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:58.540
anyway,

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:00.860
no matter what,

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:03.420
Xiao Cai has people who care about her.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.060
She's much better off than I am.

00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:08.779
I see.

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:09.779
Ms. Liu,

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.500
you are suddenly...

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.639
feeling lonely and isolated.

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:17.079
Actually, you're not alone.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.120
Don't you still have...

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:20.360
...us old friends?

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.079
That's right.

00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:23.480
Don't you still have me?

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.959
Wait, where did you...

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:27.519
You should be watching the evening news.

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:29.680
When did you sneak out?

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:31.360
Surprised, aren't you?

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.399
I just sneaked...

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:33.920
What do you mean "sneak"?

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.600
Xiao Liu,

00:07:36.279 --> 00:07:38.240
feel free to tell me anything.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.160
What I'm best at is...

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.600
doing ideological work.

00:07:41.839 --> 00:07:43.519
What's the use of telling you?

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.120
Ms. Liu's emptiness and loneliness...

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:47.240
that little bit...

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:50.240
is a topic for us single men and women.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.879
You parents with families and children...

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:54.279
wouldn't understand.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.240
Who says so?

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.240
I feel it the most deeply.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.319
How is that possible?

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.079
You have a daughter.

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:05.360
How could you understand?

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.800
Although I have a daughter...

00:08:08.199 --> 00:08:09.439
They say she's "Daddy's little girl."

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.519
But the better she treats you,

00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:14.240
the more annoyed you get.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.040
Really.

00:08:16.399 --> 00:08:17.279
So annoying.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.680
Is that a Humblebrag?

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.560
What does Humblebrag mean?

00:08:25.079 --> 00:08:25.879
Look here.

00:08:26.279 --> 00:08:28.160
Raising sons or daughters is useless.

00:08:28.439 --> 00:08:29.759
All she does is send me...

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:31.639
food, drinks, clothes, and daily items.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:34.240
Every year she takes me domestic and abroad,

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.159
sightseeing and traveling.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.600
And forces me to get three checkups a year.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.360
Is that really necessary?

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.120
President Li.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:42.000
President Li, you...

00:08:42.639 --> 00:08:43.440
Ms. Liu.

00:08:43.519 --> 00:08:44.879
This isn't a Humblebrag, is it?

00:08:44.879 --> 00:08:46.600
If that's not a Humblebrag, what is?

00:08:46.639 --> 00:08:47.440
Ms. Liu.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.600
Don't listen to him showing off to us.

00:08:49.799 --> 00:08:50.559
If you put it that way,

00:08:50.559 --> 00:08:52.279
I will show off to you then.

00:08:52.759 --> 00:08:54.799
Having children is better than having none.

00:08:55.039 --> 00:08:57.360
I made sacrifices for my children when I was young,

00:08:57.519 --> 00:08:59.600
so now I should reap the rewards.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.120
Ms. Liu.

00:09:01.399 --> 00:09:02.679
I'm not talking about you.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.000
As Xiao Cai says:

00:09:04.159 --> 00:09:05.620
"Raising children for old age" isn't guaranteed.

00:09:05.919 --> 00:09:07.480
"Living off one's parents" is actually common.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.559
If he lives off his parents now,

00:09:09.559 --> 00:09:11.879
it shows you still have value to be lived off of.

00:09:11.879 --> 00:09:13.440
It's better than being all alone,

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.679
by yourself, right?

00:09:14.879 --> 00:09:15.679
Ms. Liu.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.519
I'm really not talking about you.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.840
No kids, no burdens.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.879
Shows a high quality of life, right?

00:09:22.879 --> 00:09:24.159
Don't young people nowadays...

00:09:24.159 --> 00:09:26.039
like to be DINKs, right?

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.120
I don't know about DINK or not.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.399
They'll regret it when they get old.

00:09:30.679 --> 00:09:32.480
During holidays, going home for New Year,

00:09:32.639 --> 00:09:34.519
family reunions, family happiness.

00:09:34.639 --> 00:09:36.320
Ms. Liu, I'm really not talking about you.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.039
We don't regret it at all.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.799
During holidays, Ms. Liu and I keep each other company.

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:41.840
We...

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.480
care for each other,

00:09:43.639 --> 00:09:44.919
and help each other out.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.080
Your house full of children...

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.440
can't compare to the new friends...

00:09:47.919 --> 00:09:49.000
we made later in life.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.399
Right, Ms. Liu?

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.240
Where is she?

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.120
It's all because of you.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.000
Otherwise she wouldn't have...

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:58.679
What?

00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:00.320
Zhu Zhu is here.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.720
Zhu Zhu, when did you get here?

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.000
Grandpa Li, Grandpa Fan, I...

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.080
I just arrived.

00:10:05.799 --> 00:10:06.840
I saw everything.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:07.639
Eat up.

00:10:07.639 --> 00:10:09.759
No, how can I eat as soon as I walk in?

00:10:09.879 --> 00:10:11.519
I'm here to notify you two...

00:10:12.879 --> 00:10:14.440
What's in this bucket?

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.799
Can't you tell by looking?

00:10:15.799 --> 00:10:16.919
Then I'm opening it.

00:10:20.159 --> 00:10:21.200
Sachima!

00:10:22.759 --> 00:10:23.679
I can't eat this.

00:10:23.679 --> 00:10:24.399
Why not?

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.320
It's too sweet, I'll gain weight.

00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:27.480
It's sugar-free.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:28.519
You won't get fat.

00:10:28.639 --> 00:10:29.480
Then I'll also...

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.320
Maybe I'll taste a piece.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.480
Just a small piece.

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:33.919
Go ahead, eat, eat.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:36.720
Zhu Zhu.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.120
You seemed to say you were notifying us...

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:39.840
about something?

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.799
Dr. Chang asked me to tell you two...

00:10:41.799 --> 00:10:42.919
tomorrow night in the Activity room,

00:10:42.919 --> 00:10:45.039
we're throwing a surprise birthday party for Grandma Liu.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.039
Swallow before you speak.

00:10:46.039 --> 00:10:46.879
What did you say?

00:10:46.879 --> 00:10:48.159
Ms. Liu's birthday?

00:10:50.279 --> 00:10:51.080
When?

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.840
Tomorrow night at six.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:10:59.480
Say it.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.399
Why did you bolt faster than a rabbit?

00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:02.799
You weren't exactly slow yourself.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.000
What are you doing?

00:11:04.639 --> 00:11:05.840
Did you want to tell her,

00:11:06.159 --> 00:11:07.080
"Ms. Liu,

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.679
I've always remembered your birthday"?

00:11:09.679 --> 00:11:10.700
That's you.

00:11:12.039 --> 00:11:13.720
Uh, what I mean is,

00:11:13.919 --> 00:11:15.080
since Dr. Chang

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.879
is organizing this surprise birthday party,

00:11:17.039 --> 00:11:19.080
you, my friend, better not ruin it.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.159
Otherwise, it'd be such a buzzkill.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.039
Right.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.080
You don't need to tell me.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.720
Someone as sensible as me,

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.679
how could I not know that?

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.860
It's you I'm worried about.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.200
Don't you leak the secret.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.519
Good thing I'm supervising you.

00:11:32.639 --> 00:11:33.879
What do you mean, supervising me?

00:11:33.879 --> 00:11:34.960
I'm the one keeping an eye on you.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:35.720
Who's supervising whom?

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.639
I'm watching you.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.120
Who's knocking?

00:11:38.159 --> 00:11:38.960
Who is it?

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:39.759
Oh, it's you two.

00:11:39.759 --> 00:11:41.639
Knocking? I didn't knock.

00:11:41.759 --> 00:11:42.600
You knocked, didn't you?

00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:43.360
Why would it be me?

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.539
It was obviously you.

00:11:45.039 --> 00:11:46.000
I didn't knock either.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.159
You didn't knock?

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.720
And you didn't knock either?

00:11:50.399 --> 00:11:51.840
What are you two doing standing here?

00:11:52.039 --> 00:11:52.840
Yeah.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.159
Exactly. Yeah.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.600
What are we doing standing here?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:56.799
Admiring the moon.

00:11:56.919 --> 00:11:58.000
We're admiring the moon. Right, Old Li?

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:58.960
Right. Look.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.639
See, the moon has gone into the clouds.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.600
You two.

00:12:10.399 --> 00:12:11.799
I wanted to ask you two about tomorrow.

00:12:11.799 --> 00:12:13.320
Do you have any plans?

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.639
Tomorrow? I don't.

00:12:14.639 --> 00:12:15.159
Yes, you do.

00:12:15.159 --> 00:12:16.879
Old Li, you're going home tomorrow, right?

00:12:16.879 --> 00:12:17.679
No, I'm not.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.279
Oh, right.

00:12:19.279 --> 00:12:22.159
Uh, Old Fan is visiting a friend tomorrow too.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.039
Right, yes.

00:12:24.879 --> 00:12:25.679
Then...

00:12:26.039 --> 00:12:26.840
Alright then.

00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:28.840
Actually, tomorrow I...

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.320
I do have plans, actually.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:32.879
Good.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.879
Ms. Liu, you're busy tomorrow.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.519
I have to go home too.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.039
Okay.

00:12:40.799 --> 00:12:41.600
Goodnight.

00:12:42.039 --> 00:12:43.000
Goodnight.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.360
Hurry up and go.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.120
You go.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:49.919
You go first.

00:12:49.919 --> 00:12:50.639
Lead the way.

00:12:50.639 --> 00:12:51.539
Fine, let's go out together.

00:12:51.539 --> 00:12:53.360
Let's go together.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.879
Finally, it's all set up.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.159
Wang Song.

00:12:59.159 --> 00:13:00.440
I wanted to ask you earlier,

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.440
why the long face and the silence?

00:13:02.879 --> 00:13:04.200
He's not mad at you.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.159
His dad asked him for money, and...

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.279
I let it slip.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.120
No,

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.960
it's good enough we don't live off our parents.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.639
Why is your dad asking you for money?

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.320
It's all because my dad...

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.679
lost money in private equity.

00:13:16.879 --> 00:13:18.600
So your dad works in finance?

00:13:18.919 --> 00:13:19.720
Sort of.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.039
Actually, it's just...

00:13:21.039 --> 00:13:22.759
a few farmers from Group Two in our village...

00:13:22.919 --> 00:13:24.000
sold a cow,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.759
two sheep, and three pigs,

00:13:25.919 --> 00:13:27.480
and pooled the money for my dad to do business.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.039
Ms. Liu.

00:13:34.279 --> 00:13:35.759
We can't let Ms. Liu go to the Activity room.

00:13:35.759 --> 00:13:37.759
Or our surprise birthday party will be for nothing.

00:13:37.759 --> 00:13:38.399
Right.

00:13:39.399 --> 00:13:40.320
Ms. Liu, you...

00:13:40.679 --> 00:13:41.600
Where are you going?

00:13:41.799 --> 00:13:42.639
Nowhere special.

00:13:43.679 --> 00:13:45.480
I'm going to the Activity room.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.399
That won't do.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:47.679
Why?

00:13:47.679 --> 00:13:48.679
Be...

00:13:48.679 --> 00:13:49.360
Well...

00:13:49.399 --> 00:13:49.799
Be...

00:13:49.799 --> 00:13:50.200
Why?

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:50.919
Why?

00:13:51.159 --> 00:13:52.759
Because... I just remembered.

00:13:52.759 --> 00:13:53.200
Ms. Liu.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.639
I have a very important topic.

00:13:54.639 --> 00:13:55.600
That I need to discuss with you.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.559
That's fine.

00:13:56.679 --> 00:13:58.039
Let's go to the Activity room to talk.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.120
No.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.440
This topic of ours...

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.679
Must be discussed at the Waterside Pavilion.

00:14:02.679 --> 00:14:03.600
Right, let's go. To the Waterside Pavilion.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.039
The Waterside Pavilion is great.

00:14:05.039 --> 00:14:06.480
Let's go. Waterside Pavilion.

00:14:06.519 --> 00:14:08.080
Ms. Liu's birthday...

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:10.480
I haven't prepared a gift yet.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:12.799
Slow down.

00:14:14.159 --> 00:14:15.000
Honestly.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.600
The two grandpas are here too.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.039
Then you three elders chat first.

00:14:18.039 --> 00:14:19.000
We'll head out first.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:19.840
Wait a minute.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.600
Didn't you have an important topic to discuss?

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.360
A topic.

00:14:24.679 --> 00:14:25.480
That's a good thing.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.559
That's my strong suit.

00:14:26.799 --> 00:14:27.759
What kind of topic?

00:14:27.879 --> 00:14:28.840
I'm happy to offer advice.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.440
You can ask me any questions.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.019
With my...

00:14:32.159 --> 00:14:33.360
Rich life experience...

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.000
And vast successful experience...

00:14:35.399 --> 00:14:36.960
You're right to ask me.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:37.559
What is the question?

00:14:37.559 --> 00:14:38.240
Go ahead.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.279
Well, what is the question?

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:41.960
What is the question?

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:42.679
I...

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:44.639
What question?

00:14:44.759 --> 00:14:45.879
You say it.

00:14:45.879 --> 00:14:46.379
What question?

00:14:46.379 --> 00:14:47.039
What is the question?

00:14:47.039 --> 00:14:48.200
Right, what is the question?

00:14:48.639 --> 00:14:50.000
Um, right.

00:14:50.799 --> 00:14:51.799
The three of us...

00:14:51.799 --> 00:14:53.200
Want to ask you three elders...

00:14:53.879 --> 00:14:55.360
As parents...

00:14:55.679 --> 00:14:57.440
What exactly is the use of having children?

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:00.639
Well,

00:15:02.159 --> 00:15:02.820
I...

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:04.159
I've never been a parent.

00:15:04.519 --> 00:15:05.120
Yeah.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.480
So it's hard for me to answer this.

00:15:08.519 --> 00:15:10.820
So if you have questions, ask me.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.519
You've come to the right person.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:13.840
No need for discussion.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.899
I'll give you the conclusion straight away.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.039
Raising children for old age.

00:15:19.399 --> 00:15:20.279
I get it.

00:15:21.279 --> 00:15:22.120
Children...

00:15:22.279 --> 00:15:23.759
are just your investment.

00:15:24.159 --> 00:15:24.940
Bankbooks.

00:15:25.059 --> 00:15:26.120
ATMs.

00:15:26.799 --> 00:15:29.279
Parents can use repayment and filial piety as excuses

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.879
to take whatever they want from their kids.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.440
You young people nowadays,

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.960
that's just how you think.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.440
That's not me, Grandpa Li.

00:15:36.919 --> 00:15:37.960
Kids these days,

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.960
how many actually stay with their parents?

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:40.600
Parents...

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.159
lose money and time.

00:15:42.159 --> 00:15:43.120
If things go wrong,

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.840
they even have to raise their kids' kids.

00:15:44.879 --> 00:15:47.519
How many actually get to enjoy the blessings of grandchildren?

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.000
If you ask me,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.399
having kids is useless.

00:15:50.559 --> 00:15:53.200
In the future, forget about having kids,

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.799
I won't even get married.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.399
Me?

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.519
I envy Ms. Liu

00:15:57.519 --> 00:15:59.159
and Professor Fan's lifestyle.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.039
Envy us?

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.440
Having no one to rely on in old age?

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.679
It's called being free and easy.

00:16:05.039 --> 00:16:07.600
Money, leisure, and friends.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.440
What more could you ask for?

00:16:10.759 --> 00:16:11.559
Students,

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.480
let me summarize.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Raising children,

00:16:15.159 --> 00:16:16.960
is indeed not necessarily just for old age.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:18.879
However,

00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:20.519
raising the next generation

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.480
involves at least the following two points.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.000
Giving a lecture, are we?

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.879
Go ahead, Professor Fan. I'm listening.

00:16:26.879 --> 00:16:27.639
First,

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.799
the continuation of the tree of life.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.519
Passing the baton.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.200
The idea of carrying on the family line.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.159
Second,

00:16:34.559 --> 00:16:36.360
in the process of raising children,

00:16:36.559 --> 00:16:37.159
parents

00:16:37.379 --> 00:16:39.840
not only gain the joy of parenthood,

00:16:39.879 --> 00:16:41.159
but also in the process,

00:16:41.159 --> 00:16:42.879
receive edification and improvement.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.600
You lack this process,

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.600
that's why you're so childish.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.120
But I think Professor Fan makes sense.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.360
We discussed this in our social psychology class too.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.759
We can gain something through giving.

00:16:53.759 --> 00:16:54.440
And,

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.960
it's about finding pleasure through altruism.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:57.960
Exactly.

00:16:58.039 --> 00:16:59.120
And children,

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.039
supporting their parents in return,

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.639
is not only a traditional virtue of the Chinese nation,

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.599
but also a manifestation of altruism.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.759
Gaining a nobler happiness from it.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.640
Whether it's self-interest or altruism,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.160
having children is a natural law.

00:17:14.279 --> 00:17:15.839
Ms. Liu, you're an exception.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.559
Filial piety is the duty of children.

00:17:20.559 --> 00:17:22.400
Ms. Liu, you're still an exception.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:23.960
Actually,

00:17:24.519 --> 00:17:25.640
whether you have children or not,

00:17:26.039 --> 00:17:27.079
doesn't make a big difference.

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:28.700
Listen to him,

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:30.519
his head is full of paste.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:31.839
Grandpa Li,

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.599
you are indeed contradicting yourself a bit.

00:17:35.039 --> 00:17:36.640
So is it better to have kids,

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.160
or not to have kids?

00:17:38.519 --> 00:17:39.279
If you don't believe me, ask...

00:17:39.279 --> 00:17:40.720
Actually, I think,

00:17:41.599 --> 00:17:43.079
it's better to have kids.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.839
At least someone remembers your birthday.

00:17:45.839 --> 00:17:46.640
Birthday?

00:17:46.759 --> 00:17:47.599
That's for sure,

00:17:48.839 --> 00:17:50.160
it's nothing important.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:50.839
Right?

00:17:50.839 --> 00:17:52.079
It doesn't matter if you celebrate it or not.

00:17:52.079 --> 00:17:53.359
Birthdays aren't important.

00:17:53.559 --> 00:17:54.839
Who doesn't remember their own birthday?

00:17:54.839 --> 00:17:55.599
That's right.

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:43.579
What are you up to?

00:18:44.339 --> 00:18:45.140
You rascal.

00:18:46.099 --> 00:18:46.779
Nothing.

00:18:46.779 --> 00:18:47.900
I'm just taking a walk.

00:18:48.019 --> 00:18:49.660
Why are you nervous if you're just taking a walk?

00:18:50.059 --> 00:18:51.180
Are you here...

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.380
...waiting for Ms. Liu to spill the beans early?

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:54.140
Who?

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:55.539
Me?

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:57.140
No way.

00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:59.740
I wasn't waiting for Ms. Liu either.

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:01.220
Ms. Liu!

00:19:01.859 --> 00:19:02.660
Xiao Cai.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:04.900
What are you two doing?

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:05.619
Admiring the moon.

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:06.500
No.

00:19:07.259 --> 00:19:08.259
Is Ms. Liu in?

00:19:08.259 --> 00:19:09.019
She is.

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:10.660
She's been there since her nap.

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.099
Primping and preening.

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:13.539
She's sprucing herself up right now.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:21.500
What for?

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:22.339
Old Li.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:25.980
Everyone worked so hard on this surprise.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:27.779
You'd better not mess it up.

00:19:27.779 --> 00:19:29.059
Am I that kind of person?

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:31.460
Just worry about yourself.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:32.579
You're trying to boss me around?

00:19:32.579 --> 00:19:34.099
With that mouth of yours...

00:19:34.099 --> 00:19:35.339
It's like a sieve.

00:19:35.339 --> 00:19:36.259
If you don't keep it shut...

00:19:36.259 --> 00:19:37.619
You're bound to let it slip.

00:19:37.619 --> 00:19:38.539
Who?

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.539
Your mouth is as loose as an old waistband.

00:19:40.539 --> 00:19:41.680
You're one to talk.

00:19:41.779 --> 00:19:42.859
You really are...

00:19:44.339 --> 00:19:45.140
Ms. Liu.

00:19:46.059 --> 00:19:46.859
You two.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.339
Admiring the moon here again?

00:19:50.339 --> 00:19:50.980
Yes.

00:19:51.579 --> 00:19:53.299
No, wait. The moon isn't out yet, ha.

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:54.740
We are...

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.500
Admiring the sunset.

00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:58.339
Ms. Liu.

00:19:58.339 --> 00:19:59.140
Today you...

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:00.500
Look very stunning.

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:05.339
Because today is a special day.

00:20:05.819 --> 00:20:07.140
Don't you know?

00:20:07.299 --> 00:20:08.099
I know.

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:09.579
Today is that...

00:20:11.579 --> 00:20:12.700
Huairou Seniors' Day.

00:20:14.059 --> 00:20:14.859
Incorrect.

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.500
Professor Fan, do you know?

00:20:18.099 --> 00:20:19.220
I certainly know.

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:20.740
Today is your...

00:20:21.859 --> 00:20:23.740
It's the senior...

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.980
...fashion show rehearsal you follow, right?

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:27.940
Otherwise why would you be dressed...

00:20:28.779 --> 00:20:29.700
So beautifully?

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:30.940
Also wrong.

00:20:31.259 --> 00:20:32.740
The opening of Food Week?

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:34.579
Then whose birthday is it?

00:20:34.579 --> 00:20:35.259
Right.

00:20:35.579 --> 00:20:36.380
Who?

00:20:36.579 --> 00:20:37.619
Whose birthday?

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:38.700
Let me check.

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:39.420
Whose?

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:40.140
Let me check.

00:20:42.019 --> 00:20:42.819
Liang Sicheng.

00:20:43.079 --> 00:20:43.880
Liang Sicheng.

00:20:44.019 --> 00:20:46.140
His 122nd posthumous birthday.

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:46.819
Right?

00:20:46.819 --> 00:20:47.619
Liang Sicheng.

00:20:48.299 --> 00:20:49.180
You know him, right?

00:20:55.859 --> 00:20:57.380
If I hadn't kept a close watch,

00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:59.859
you almost let it slip.

00:20:59.859 --> 00:21:01.019
If I hadn't been so vigilant,

00:21:01.019 --> 00:21:02.220
you would have leaked it long ago.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:02.900
What are you talking about?

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:03.640
Who?

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:03.940
Who did I say?

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:05.019
I didn't specify.

00:21:05.099 --> 00:21:06.019
I was just saying.

00:21:06.019 --> 00:21:07.420
If I specified, I would have let it slip.

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:08.259
Didn't I check afterwards?

00:21:08.259 --> 00:21:09.779
That was good teamwork, right?

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:24.740
Who is it?

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:25.700
Grandma Liu.

00:21:26.099 --> 00:21:27.740
I'm here to clean up for you.

00:21:28.299 --> 00:21:29.259
Wang Song.

00:21:29.539 --> 00:21:30.500
Wang Song.

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:32.420
You're just in time.

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:33.019
Help me, quick.

00:21:33.019 --> 00:21:33.980
Hurry, help me out.

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:34.740
What's wrong?

00:21:34.779 --> 00:21:36.460
Help me order a cake.

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.019
I want a sugar-free one.

00:21:39.019 --> 00:21:40.259
I've been fiddling with this for ages.

00:21:40.259 --> 00:21:41.900
I... You shouldn't buy one.

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:43.259
Why?

00:21:43.259 --> 00:21:44.180
It's not that.

00:21:44.859 --> 00:21:45.900
It's not a holiday or anything.

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:47.380
Why are you buying a cake?

00:21:47.619 --> 00:21:48.420
I...

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:51.660
Today is my birthday.

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:53.779
And I...

00:21:54.099 --> 00:21:55.539
have no children.

00:21:57.099 --> 00:21:59.579
No one remembers my birthday either.

00:22:01.259 --> 00:22:03.059
Usually, I don't care.

00:22:03.059 --> 00:22:04.700
But today, I don't know why...

00:22:05.019 --> 00:22:06.640
I'm getting old.

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:08.460
Don't say that.

00:22:08.819 --> 00:22:10.420
It's just a birthday.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.420
I don't remember my parents' birthdays either.

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:16.420
It seems...

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:19.299
Seems like raising me was a waste, right?

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:20.960
Do you think...

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.940
my parents failed as parents,

00:22:24.259 --> 00:22:26.339
or did I fail as a son?

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:31.859
Ms. Liu.

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:33.700
Xiao Xin.

00:22:34.619 --> 00:22:36.539
Director Chang invites you to the Activity room.

00:22:36.539 --> 00:22:37.380
Why?

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:39.980
A knowledge lecture.

00:22:40.099 --> 00:22:41.500
A very important one.

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:43.940
Oh, Xiao Xin.

00:22:44.619 --> 00:22:46.059
At my age,

00:22:46.059 --> 00:22:47.539
what is still important?

00:22:47.539 --> 00:22:48.940
I'm not going.

00:22:49.019 --> 00:22:49.819
Tell Director Chang... No...

00:22:49.819 --> 00:22:51.140
You can't not go.

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.099
Director Chang insisted.

00:22:53.299 --> 00:22:55.740
Even if others don't go, you must go.

00:22:55.779 --> 00:22:57.099
If you don't go,

00:22:57.099 --> 00:22:58.779
my mission won't be complete.

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:00.059
Don't make this hard for me. No...

00:23:00.059 --> 00:23:00.380
Go on.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.420
Good child, listen to me.

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:01.819
Let's go.

00:23:01.839 --> 00:23:03.940
Just tell them I can't go.

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:04.880
What is going on with you two?

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:05.400
Don't drag me.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:06.539
My shoes!

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:07.539
My shoes!

00:23:08.099 --> 00:23:09.440
My shoes, you guys!

00:23:10.339 --> 00:23:11.380
Let's go.

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.980
What lecture? There's no one here.

00:23:14.339 --> 00:23:16.619
What are you guys up to?

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.380
Wishing Ms. Liu...

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.400
Happy Birthday!

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:28.559
Thank you.

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.059
Thank you all.

00:23:30.259 --> 00:23:31.980
You still remembered my birthday.

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:33.740
I've always remembered your birthday.

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:34.900
Give me a break.

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.579
You didn't even prepare a birthday gift.

00:23:36.579 --> 00:23:37.460
And you say you remembered?

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:38.119
Ms. Liu.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.539
Look at mine.

00:23:39.819 --> 00:23:40.500
Okay.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:42.460
Wishing Ms. Liu...

00:23:42.819 --> 00:23:43.819
health and longevity.

00:23:43.819 --> 00:23:45.480
Good.

00:23:46.539 --> 00:23:47.539
Thank you.

00:23:47.539 --> 00:23:48.779
Thank you, Professor Fan.

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:51.380
You even wrote the character "Longevity" just for me.

00:23:51.539 --> 00:23:53.619
He didn't write that just for you.

00:23:53.619 --> 00:23:55.779
He wrote this for Mr. Wen Xingyu.

00:23:55.779 --> 00:23:56.819
He added two vertical lines on the side,

00:23:56.819 --> 00:23:58.220
and it became "Ms. Liu".

00:23:59.299 --> 00:24:01.460
That's still better than you preparing nothing.

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:02.900
Who says I didn't prepare anything?

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:03.380
Yingzi.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:03.980
Bring it here.

00:24:04.339 --> 00:24:05.259
Honestly.

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:06.220
Ms. Liu.

00:24:06.539 --> 00:24:07.859
Look at the gift I bought for you.

00:24:07.859 --> 00:24:08.900
Do you like it?

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:11.140
It's a silk scarf.

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:11.900
Take a look.

00:24:17.059 --> 00:24:17.779
President Li

00:24:17.779 --> 00:24:19.940
I didn't expect you to have such good taste.

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:20.819
This must be Yingzi's.

00:24:20.819 --> 00:24:21.859
She bought it for her mom.

00:24:21.859 --> 00:24:23.420
But President Li commandeered it.

00:24:24.099 --> 00:24:26.859
You kid, you're not just greedy, you're cheeky too.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.940
Happy birthday, Ms. Liu.

00:24:31.859 --> 00:24:32.859
Thank you.

00:24:33.619 --> 00:24:35.380
I'm so happy.

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:39.099
I've had no children all my life.

00:24:39.579 --> 00:24:40.819
Lonely and solitary.

00:24:40.819 --> 00:24:41.940
I never expected that in my old age...

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:44.180
Ms. Liu, please don't say that.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:45.460
Our community...

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:46.819
is a home for the elderly.

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.099
And we are your family.

00:24:49.099 --> 00:24:49.779
Right.

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:53.519
The whole community is one big family.

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:54.220
Good.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:56.720
Hello?

00:24:57.519 --> 00:24:58.319
Dad.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.240
It's me.

00:25:00.599 --> 00:25:01.400
Xiao Song.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.519
Yes.

00:25:04.799 --> 00:25:06.279
I'm calling you...

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:07.980
to tell you...

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.420
I am not your ATM.

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:12.740
Nor your pension insurance.

00:25:14.779 --> 00:25:16.299
But I am your son.

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.220
I'll always be your biological son.

00:25:20.059 --> 00:25:21.700
I won't let you grow old with no one to rely on.

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:24.059
I'm transferring ten thousand yuan to you now.

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.339
I earned this money bit by bit working part-time.

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.299
Use it to pay back the money you owe people.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.059
Go visit my grandma when you have time.

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:36.180
That's all. Bye.

00:25:37.539 --> 00:25:38.339
What's up?

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.059
Your dad rushing you to send money again?

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:41.740
No.

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:45.299
This time I gave it to him willingly.

00:25:46.099 --> 00:25:48.980
Actually, it's not easy for them either.

00:25:49.619 --> 00:25:51.059
It's all for our family.

00:25:51.539 --> 00:25:52.859
You're pretty enlightened.

00:25:53.299 --> 00:25:54.779
Then let me have the cake.

00:25:56.579 --> 00:25:57.660
You eat it. Go ahead.

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:00.740
I'm going to listen to Yusheng and the others sing.

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:01.480
Thanks.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:10.119
Ms. Liu, happy birthday to you.

00:26:11.599 --> 00:26:13.480
Thank you. Happy birthday.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.319
Doctor.

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:16.539
Well, I...

00:26:17.279 --> 00:26:18.759
When I celebrate my birthday this year,

00:26:18.759 --> 00:26:20.759
I want to have a surprise birthday party like this too.

00:26:20.759 --> 00:26:21.339
What do you think?

00:26:22.599 --> 00:26:23.640
You've already said it out loud.

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:24.480
Where's the surprise in that?

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.720
There won't be anything unexpected.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.359
I haven't told you everything yet.

00:26:27.359 --> 00:26:28.319
Don't tell us everything.

00:26:28.319 --> 00:26:30.720
My birthday is August 16th.

00:26:30.799 --> 00:26:31.720
When the time comes,

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.440
I demand the same treatment as Ms. Liu.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.400
Exactly the same.

00:26:35.119 --> 00:26:37.119
Balloons, cake, cold fireworks.

00:26:37.119 --> 00:26:38.799
And what you young people just did,

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.119
playing instruments and singing.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.079
Professor Fan,

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.160
our internship ends in August.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.759
We probably won't be in the retirement community anymore.

00:26:45.759 --> 00:26:46.480
Yeah.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.640
I've already found a job starting in August.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.440
Why is there no one to care when it's my turn?

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:52.480
We'll take care of it.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:53.799
It's a promise.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.079
On the day of your birthday,

00:26:55.079 --> 00:26:56.319
no matter where we are,

00:26:56.319 --> 00:26:57.799
we'll rush back to celebrate your birthday, Professor Fan.

00:26:57.799 --> 00:26:58.920
What does everyone say?

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.119
Yes!

00:27:00.519 --> 00:27:01.319
Thank you.
