No, I'm saying I'll give it to you.

There's this lovely lady I met
at a massage place.

You said that single room felt cramped,
so that's what it was for!

You two only said a few words,

00:12:04.105 --> 00:12:07.138
So, are you married?

- Pardon?
- What's your religion?

Well...

I was too pushy, wasn't I?

00:12:20.405 --> 00:12:21.905
My son just works

00:12:21.905 --> 00:12:27.138
all the time and still isn't married,
so I worry about him.

00:12:27.138 --> 00:12:31.938
I'm truly happy after getting married.

00:12:31.938 --> 00:12:33.701
What was so great about it?

00:12:33.701 --> 00:12:35.138
Well...

00:12:35.138 --> 00:12:39.305
Nowadays, I spend
a lot of time alone like this.

00:12:39.305 --> 00:12:42.005
But it wasn't like this
when the kids were young.

00:12:42.005 --> 00:12:45.472
I'd chat about everything
with my husband after work.

00:12:45.472 --> 00:12:49.305
In summer, we'd go to the beach and swim.

00:12:49.305 --> 00:12:55.338
In winter, we'd warm our hands,
have snowball fights, and decorate trees.

00:12:55.972 --> 00:12:59.301
There was never a time I wasn't happy.

00:12:59.301 --> 00:13:00.738
Oh.

00:13:00.738 --> 00:13:02.597
I'm sorry.

Oh, I'm being sentimental in my old age.

00:13:04.438 --> 00:13:07.072
Oh, not at all!

00:13:07.072 --> 00:13:09.038
I'm so envious.

Just hearing this, I can tell you're
a wonderful wife and mother.

00:13:14.372 --> 00:13:17.438
I think the reason your husband
could comfortably talk about his day,

00:13:17.438 --> 00:13:21.472
and your children could laugh
and run around so freely,

00:13:21.472 --> 00:13:23.572
is that you created

00:13:23.572 --> 00:13:28.229
such a warm home.

00:13:28.229 --> 00:13:31.472
Oh my... I'm going to cry.

00:13:32.938 --> 00:13:36.572
My son probably doesn't know I feel this way.

00:13:36.572 --> 00:13:39.572
I'm sure your son knows.

00:13:39.572 --> 00:13:42.305
He just hasn't said it yet.

There's something like that.

How should I put it?

00:13:48.598 --> 00:13:50.405

Manager Jang, are you tired?
Can I get you some coffee?

00:21:34.105 --> 00:21:35.572
Ah, no thanks.

00:21:35.572 --> 00:21:39.205
Slept late last night. Feeling a bit groggy.

00:21:39.205 --> 00:21:41.538
A massage would be
perfect on a day like this.

00:21:41.538 --> 00:21:43.738
Ugh, I wish someone would just
give me a rubdown.

00:21:43.738 --> 00:21:45.905
Tell me about it.

00:21:45.905 --> 00:21:47.005
What about you, Tak Soo?

00:21:47.005 --> 00:21:49.738
Actually, I have a Level 2
massage certification.

00:21:49.738 --> 00:21:51.372
I could give you one later.

00:21:51.372 --> 00:21:53.105
- Here.
- What's this?

00:21:53.105 --> 00:21:57.538
This is for massaging the neck
and shoulders. It's pretty refreshing.

00:21:57.538 --> 00:21:59.405
All of a sudden?

00:21:59.405 --> 00:22:00.872
Manager Jang!

- Have you seen it?
- What?

00:22:02.172 --> 00:22:04.605
The President just had recliner sofas
delivered to every break room.

00:22:04.605 --> 00:22:05.872
Everyone's checking them out right now.

00:22:05.872 --> 00:22:07.038

one for each team, for our hardworking staff.

Lemon tea is for when you're stressed.

Hui Won,

00:22:45.938 --> 00:22:48.421
your stomach's been upset lately,
so stick to warm tea.

These are vitamin D and iron supplements,
essential for pregnant women.

00:22:59.038 --> 00:23:01.438
is the macaron you love from the bakery
next to the bank at the intersection.

00:23:01.438 --> 00:23:03.638
Eat one whenever you crave sugar, okay?

00:23:03.638 --> 00:23:06.705
Isn't it basic knowledge that pregnant women
should avoid sweets?

00:23:06.705 --> 00:23:10.072
Don't you know that the stress
of not eating what you crave

00:23:10.072 --> 00:23:11.272
is even worse?

00:23:11.272 --> 00:23:14.672
When the time comes for those cravings,
I'll naturally buy them for her.

00:23:14.672 --> 00:23:18.172
Do you think I can't afford to buy them
because I'm broke or something? Huh?

00:23:18.172 --> 00:23:21.072
You keep buying her things.

00:23:21.072 --> 00:23:23.305
- Why are you worrying about my child?
- What's going on with those two?

00:23:23.305 --> 00:23:24.905
No! How is it your child already?

00:23:24.905 --> 00:23:26.772
Isn't it too early to claim paternity?

00:23:26.772 --> 00:23:29.505
The baby she's carrying is my child,
so it's my child.

00:23:29.505 --> 00:23:32.472
Hey! What if someone hears you?
Be careful what you say.

00:23:32.472 --> 00:23:35.038
You keep forgetting I'm your boss.

00:23:35.038 --> 00:23:38.138
What exactly are you up to?

00:23:41.637 --> 00:23:44.705
Oh, how's the morning sickness lately?

00:23:44.705 --> 00:23:48.172
It was bad at first,
but I'm doing better now.

00:23:48.172 --> 00:23:51.338
I heard pregnant women
crave sweet and sour things.

Is that true for you too, Manager?

00:23:52.905 --> 00:23:56.172
Actually, I've been craving
cold raw fish soup lately.

00:23:56.172 --> 00:23:57.872

There's this place in Pohang
called White Lighthouse.

Their cold raw fish soup is
so refreshing and tangy. It's so good.

Ah, just thinking about it
makes my mouth water.

00:24:19.438 --> 00:24:21.838
Wow, please take me there sometime.

00:30:28.372 --> 00:30:29.701
you've even confessed?

00:30:29.701 --> 00:30:30.705
What?

00:30:30.705 --> 00:30:33.972
You seem to occasionally
forget that I'm the company president.

00:30:33.972 --> 00:30:35.205
Wow, petty.

00:30:35.205 --> 00:30:39.105
Didn't we agree to drop
the ranks and play fair?

00:30:39.105 --> 00:30:41.338
Another bottle of soju here, please.

00:30:41.338 --> 00:30:43.472
Just bring three bottles.

00:30:43.472 --> 00:30:45.638
Looks like we'll finish them quickly.

00:31:11.072 --> 00:31:13.738
Why are they both doing this to me?

00:31:13.738 --> 00:31:16.472
Why is the President making
it so obvious at work?

00:31:16.472 --> 00:31:19.005
What if someone sees?

00:31:19.005 --> 00:31:20.738
And what's with him all of a sudden?

00:31:20.738 --> 00:31:23.872
What if he gets fired from the company
for competing with the President?

00:31:24.938 --> 00:31:27.805
Jeez, why is everyone like this?

00:31:27.805 --> 00:31:30.638
I'm tired. Seriously.

00:31:30.638 --> 00:31:33.541
Seems like alcohol doesn't sit well
with you, Assistant Manager Cha.

00:31:33.541 --> 00:31:35.005
Go on.

00:31:35.005 --> 00:31:36.805
- You are drunk.
- Drink.

00:31:36.805 --> 00:31:38.472
How much did you drink in such a short time?

00:31:38.472 --> 00:31:41.005
President, do you know
how petty the President is?

00:31:41.005 --> 00:31:43.905
- I'm the President?
- He gave me this much paperwork

00:31:43.905 --> 00:31:46.472
and told me to sort it out within a week.

00:31:46.472 --> 00:31:47.538
No.

00:31:47.538 --> 00:31:50.372
You are saying things
they won't even remember.

00:31:50.372 --> 00:31:51.538
Let's go home. Let's go home.

00:31:51.538 --> 00:31:53.705
Mister, I didn't call a designated driver.
Leave. Hurry.

00:31:53.705 --> 00:31:55.138
What are you talking about?

00:31:55.138 --> 00:31:56.738
- Let's go home.
- No.

00:31:56.738 --> 00:31:59.005
Excuse me!

00:31:59.005 --> 00:32:01.305
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:32:01.305 --> 00:32:04.172
Assistant Manager Cha,
you call a designated driver.

00:32:04.172 --> 00:32:06.272
I don't have a car.

00:32:09.005 --> 00:32:10.105
What, you're sleeping now?

00:32:10.105 --> 00:32:13.172
Let's go home. Let's go home. Huh?

00:32:13.172 --> 00:32:14.872
Ow, hot.

00:32:14.872 --> 00:32:16.838
Home...

00:32:16.838 --> 00:32:18.472

[Game Over]
Who am I talking to?

00:32:23.525 --> 00:32:25.189
Wait...

00:32:26.872 --> 00:32:28.638
President.

00:32:29.438 --> 00:32:30.572
What is all this?

00:32:30.572 --> 00:32:34.338
I didn't know what you'd like,
so I bought everything.

00:32:34.338 --> 00:32:37.338
Chicken, pizza, tteokbokki, sushi...

00:32:37.338 --> 00:32:40.905
And this... desserts and salad too.

00:32:40.905 --> 00:32:41.972
All of this?

00:32:41.972 --> 00:32:45.772
But what exactly is your favorite food?

00:32:45.772 --> 00:32:47.005
- What?
- Your hobbies?

00:32:47.005 --> 00:32:51.205
I mean, not those random places,
just neighborhoods you often go to,

00:32:51.205 --> 00:32:54.272
or regular shops you visit.

00:32:54.272 --> 00:32:58.438
Did you come here in the middle
of the night to ask that?

00:32:58.438 --> 00:33:00.872
Assistant Manager Cha knows everything.

00:33:00.872 --> 00:33:02.872
He knows you can't handle spice

00:33:02.872 --> 00:33:06.005
so you eat malatang at level 0.5.

00:33:06.005 --> 00:33:09.672
He knows you choose spicy cold noodles
over plain cold noodles after meat.

00:33:09.672 --> 00:33:12.438
He knows everything. Only I don't know.

00:33:12.438 --> 00:33:16.038
Are you still not done
with that childish ego fight?

00:33:16.038 --> 00:33:17.705
Please stop.

00:33:17.705 --> 00:33:20.038
What if someone starts suspecting something?

00:33:20.038 --> 00:33:23.505
Ms. Jang Hui Won,
is that really so important?

00:33:23.505 --> 00:33:24.705
Of course it is.

00:33:24.705 --> 00:33:28.405
If our relationship is exposed,
I'm the one who'll be judged.

00:33:28.405 --> 00:33:31.772
No, no, no.

00:33:31.772 --> 00:33:35.138
What you're worried about won't happen.

00:33:35.138 --> 00:33:37.538
I'll block it all for you.

00:33:49.861 --> 00:33:51.461
You...

00:33:56.205 --> 00:33:58.072
Ugh, jeez.

00:33:58.072 --> 00:34:01.205
I told them to make up,
but what time is it now, seriously?

00:34:01.205 --> 00:34:03.638
Ugh, I'm stressed. She's not
off work already, is she?

00:34:03.638 --> 00:34:04.805
Hold on.

00:34:04.805 --> 00:34:05.861
Oh.

00:34:05.861 --> 00:34:07.461
Oh, Secretary Go.

00:34:07.461 --> 00:34:13.038
I didn't just pick it up.
I bought it for you.

00:34:13.038 --> 00:34:16.338
Thank you. It's warm.

00:34:16.338 --> 00:34:19.172
Secretary Go, you haven't left work yet?

00:34:19.172 --> 00:34:23.305
I suppose this is the fate
of a secretary serving the President.

00:34:25.272 --> 00:34:26.772
What about you, Team Leader Bang?

00:34:26.772 --> 00:34:29.472
Are you working this late?

00:34:29.472 --> 00:34:33.605
I suppose this is the fate
of a team leader guiding a team.

00:34:33.605 --> 00:34:36.438
People call me ruthless, but I enjoy working.

00:34:36.438 --> 00:34:38.605
Because mistakes aren't tolerated.

00:34:38.605 --> 00:34:40.105
That's admirable.

00:34:40.105 --> 00:34:43.272
Not ruthless, just impressive.

00:34:43.272 --> 00:34:46.972
This is the way I see you, Team Leader.

00:35:37.305 --> 00:35:39.072
Take it.

00:35:39.072 --> 00:35:40.901
That seems like an important call.

00:35:40.901 --> 00:35:43.905
Completely clueless.

Okay.

Yes.

What? The President?

00:35:52.672 --> 00:35:55.405
Why there? I just took him home.

Jeez, sober up before you leave.

00:36:13.172 --> 00:36:15.305
You're in no condition to even take a taxi.

00:36:15.305 --> 00:36:18.438
Why did you drink so much?
What if you get sick again?

00:36:18.438 --> 00:36:21.372
I didn't want to lose.

00:36:21.372 --> 00:36:23.772
What's so important about winning or losing?

00:36:23.772 --> 00:36:24.805
It matters.

00:36:24.805 --> 00:36:29.305
In the men's world, that's crucial.

00:36:29.305 --> 00:36:33.638
Anyway, I won't disturb you. Get some rest.

Alright.

00:36:52.438 --> 00:36:56.205
But only five minutes.

00:37:18.072 --> 00:37:21.038
was really wonderful.

00:38:15.405 --> 00:38:18.338
let go of your hand again.

01:04:13.672 --> 01:04:16.472
I hope the person you really need
by your side right now is me.

01:04:16.472 --> 01:04:19.205
I thought I was naturally
the one you needed, Ms. Jang Hui Won.

01:04:19.205 --> 01:04:22.038
But today, it suddenly occurred to me
that it might not be me.

01:04:22.038 --> 01:04:23.705
I confessed to Hui Won.

01:04:23.705 --> 01:04:25.872
And I'm confident I can handle it.
