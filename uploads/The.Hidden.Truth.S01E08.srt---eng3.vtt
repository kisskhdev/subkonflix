00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.430
Tie him up tight.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.000
Stop looking. Hurry up.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:28.870
Go get Bai.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.190
Quick.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:06.870
Rest in peace.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.940
=The Hidden Truth=

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.580
=Episode 8=

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.430
Come here.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.310
Listen.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.240
Go out the back, now.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.000
Find a crowded place.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.800
Let them see you.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.470
The more people, the better. Got it?

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.310
I'm not leaving.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.190
You have to.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.300
Go. Now.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.150
I'm not going.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.560
I said I'm not going.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.130
I'm back because I knew
Zhang Ming would be trouble.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.000
If he manages to get away,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
we're done.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.910
We? What do you mean we're done?

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.150
Wang Yimo, listen to me.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.590
Everything that happened,

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.470
I did it all by myself.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.680
It has nothing to do with you.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.520
Got it?

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.310
Even if something happens to you?

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.520
Even if I'm left an orphan?

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.520
Dad.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.800
Stop carrying everything

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.240
by yourself.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.840
I can help.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:29.910
Help how?

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.280
In my own way.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.080
Dad, tell me the truth.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.030
How much

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.360
does Zhang Ming know?

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.750
How involved is he?

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.910
Don't worry about it.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.800
He lost control today,

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.330
was it because of those casino guys

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.870
who came by earlier?

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.870
What happened between you?

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:52.710
Stop asking!

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.120
Wang Yimo,

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.960
I don't want you dragged into this.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.280
The moment you're in trouble,

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.560
I was already in it.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.920
Dad,

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.000
let me help you fix this.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.750
If you won't tell me,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.390
I'll figure it out myself.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.910
Wake up.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.760
Ali.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.430
I've done so much for you.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.040
I've worked here for years.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.750
You can't do this to me.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.400
Is that so?

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.270
Did you consider that

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.000
when you were stabbing us in the back?

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.520
Ming,

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.310
my dad's treated you well.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.240
Why did you go behind our back

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.070
and work with the casino people?

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.950
They came to me.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.360
I was forced.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.560
If I'd known it'd end like this,

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.600
I never would've let him go back then.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:08.800
What are you talking about?

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.200
Dad.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.630
What's he talking about?

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.720
What did you do?

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.190
What did you do?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.840
What's that sound?

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.630
I steered clear of his head

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.800
and kept the dirt thin

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.000
I thought

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.270
let fate decide.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.920
Didn't think he'd actually survive.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:36.680
Zhang Ming.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.840
This whole mess

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:41.750
is because of him.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.830
It's because of me.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.000
I followed everything you said.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.120
I just wanted money to save my mom.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.240
Murder's too big a crime, Ali.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.950
I didn't dare.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.390
My mom only has me.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.750
If something happens to me,

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.800
she's dead for sure.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.310
Murder?

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.680
Dad, did you kill someone?

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.040
Whom?

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.320
Ali…

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:20.270
Ali…

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.750
Please let me go, Ali.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.750
Ali, I'll do whatever you say.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:24.590
Ali.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.750
Whatever you say.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.190
I'll do whatever you tell me to.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:28.040
Please, let me go.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.000
I'm begging you, Ali.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.480
Dad, we can't let him go.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.270
He knows too much.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.830
Wang Yimo.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.240
I did so much for you.

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:39.680
You came back

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.600
two months early behind his back.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.040
You had me hunt dog thieves,

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.830
turned the whole city upside down.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:50.240
The Huacai case and the dog thefts

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:51.800
- are unclear.
- Shut up!

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.560
Now the cops are on me.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.190
You don't help me

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:56.720
and dump me when I'm done.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.870
That's cold, Wang Yimo.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:01.880
See you.

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:09.590
Ming,

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.160
I know you're under pressure

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.160
because of your mom.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.040
If you're in trouble,

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.120
talk to my dad anytime.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.800
You've worked here for years.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.750
If we can help, we will.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.750
But you can't steal from the restaurant.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.520
Mr. Zhang.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.400
Dr. Wang.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.040
Here's your mother's treatment bill

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:29.880
for this month.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.500
(Total amount)

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.360
Thank you, Dr. Wang.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.150
- No problem.
- Thank you.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.720
I won't tell my dad.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.320
But Ming,

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:42.110
I helped you.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.790
Now you have to help me.

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:44.950
Okay.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.670
My dad doesn't know I'm back yet.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.960
I need you to do a few things for me.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.390
You can't tell anyone.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:51.320
Especially my dad.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.150
If you help me,

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.340
I won't say a word

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.870
about the accounts.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.630
And I won't interfere with you again.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:01.390
Okay.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.440
Ali,

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:06.350
do you think

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.080
your daughter doesn't know

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.720
what you've arranged for her?

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.000
She knows everything.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:16.750
Dad.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.200
I'm worried about you.

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.200
We agreed

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:22.240
you'd sell it and move to Xinjing

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.510
to be with me.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.030
But then you backed out

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.510
and made excuses.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:28.690
You kept me from coming back.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.840
I have to know what happened.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:37.630
I've been used by both of you.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:40.000
I got nothing.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.480
Only blame piled on me.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.750
What you said today,

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:56.390
who else have you told?

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:57.960
Ali,

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.000
no one.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.440
I never meant to hurt anyone.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.670
I've worked for you all these years.

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:11.440
Please let me go.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:12.600
Ali.

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:13.840
Dad, don't let him go.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.360
Let me go, Ali.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.790
Ali, please. Ali.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.270
Ali... Ali.

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:21.670
Help me, Ali.

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:24.360
Ali, please have mercy.

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:26.030
Please, let me go.

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:27.320
Please...

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.320
It'll be over soon.

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:30.360
Ali.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:31.630
Go in peace.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.270
You sure you want to keep him?

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.080
We'll talk at home.

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:32.540
(Welcome to Hongyun Restaurant)

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.420
(Ali)

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:54.060
(Li Tong)

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:56.940
(Li Tong)

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.030
To the old house.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.550
The subscriber you dialed
can not be connected.

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:19.750
(Ali)
Please leave a message after the tone.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.800
Recording done.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.320
Ali?

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:46.120
Are you home?

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:53.990
Ali?

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:10.840
Dad.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.480
The person Zhang Ming mentioned

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:14.910
was Bai, right?

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.630
You tried to kill him back then?

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:24.550
Too bad he's still alive.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:28.510
That's why you won't leave.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.670
That's why

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:32.110
you won't let me come back.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.440
Dad,

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.910
I know everything you did

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:40.030
was to protect me.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.240
Especially now, with Bai.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.670
He's been using me to threaten you.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.960
But Bai is never satisfied.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:49.270
Every time you give in,

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:50.550
he just pushes further.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.560
Dad.

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.150
I'm not a helpless little girl anymore.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.030
I can protect you in my way.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.030
So you came back without telling me.

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:08.730
Don't think I don't know anything.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:12.150
If I hadn't protected you,

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:15.080
you'd have been in trouble already.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:16.790
You knew I came back?

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:23.390
I know

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.200
you wanted to help me.

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:27.550
But back then,

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.550
I thought

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.320
I had things under control.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.750
I believed if Bai was dealt with fast,

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:38.670
none of this would've happened.

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:41.750
I know you.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.360
Even if I'd asked,

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.720
you wouldn't have told me, right?

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.750
I found out you met Bai

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:50.630
and tracked his movements

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:53.480
between the casino and the shelter.

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:55.270
I used Zhang Ming,

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:56.960
the dog thieves,

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.360
and everyone

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:00.030
just to shift the police's focus

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:01.150
onto Bai.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.870
Only if he was caught would you be safe.

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:17.150
I won't be safe.

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:20.600
There's more than just Bai.

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:23.440
But you're different.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.240
You're my daughter.

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:26.840
You're my everything.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.150
You have to be okay.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.440
But Dad,

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:33.240
if anything happens to you,

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:35.440
what do I do?

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:38.960
I don't want anything else.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.550
I just want a warm home.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.440
You gave me a home.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.150
I can't lose you.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.910
You still have a future.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.360
Stop trying to talk me out of it.

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:01.200
I'm already in this.

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:06.910
Right now, the priority

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:08.840
is fixing what's in front of us.

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:12.270
Li Xu answers to Bai too.

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:14.440
What exactly is between you?

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:23.000
I've already

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.840
figured out a solution.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.150
Stay out of it.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.320
This ends here.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:32.960
Dad.

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:38.630
From now on,

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:40.920
leave it to me.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:51.080
There's a dermatologist
at Third City Hospital.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.910
Great with scar removal.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.440
If you want,

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:57.710
I'll go with you.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.070
Give it a try.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:16:59.920
It really works.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:02.680
Yimo,

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:04.510
thank you.

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:06.110
Trust me.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:07.830
No matter what happens,

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.310
I'll take good care of you both.

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:18.500
(Zhang Ming)

00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:26.790
A friend needs me.

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:27.680
I forgot.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.200
I need to go now.

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:30.430
That urgent?

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.360
Yeah.

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:32.400
Ms. Tong, take your time.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.240
I'm heading out.

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:34.870
Be careful.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.740
(Debt; Incoming Call)

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:06.100
(Debt; Incoming Call)

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:09.390
Hello?

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:10.920
Has the neighbor come back yet?

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:13.130
No.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.000
I just checked.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.590
They're not answering either.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.240
Find out where they went

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:20.750
and what they did.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.310
If they come back,

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:24.920
call me immediately.

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:45.910
Drink.

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:48.590
I really can't anymore.

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.960
Hello, sir.

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:12.550
Why aren't you singing?

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:17.480
What do you like?

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:18.400
I'll pick one for you.

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:35.150
Relax.

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:38.960
We've met before.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.400
I know your line of work.

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:44.000
Usually it's

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.200
a sick mom,

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:48.160
a gambling dad.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.310
But somehow,

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:52.830
you're different.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.750
You look like someone

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.590
who ran away from the mountains

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.350
with an abusive husband back home.

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:12.310
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.270
The scars on you

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.110
don't lie.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.480
Do what I say,

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:32.760
and money

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:34.830
won't be a problem.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.640
What do you want me to do?

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:39.550
Be clear.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.560
I don't take

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.520
dirty money.

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:49.870
Simple.

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:51.880
Get close to one person.

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:54.110
Become familiar.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.640
Tell me

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.920
his movements

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.350
and daily habits.

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:03.110
What's your relationship

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:05.070
with him?

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:06.670
Friends.

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:09.550
Best friends.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.480
Sorry.

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:13.110
New here?

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.560
Then let me help you.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:17.840
Thanks.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.310
Why do you think

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.000
I can do this?

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.350
Because you look just like

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.030
his late wife.

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:32.830
This face is what I need.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.560
Sir,

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.110
find someone else.

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:50.920
Dong'an Village, Baijia Town,
Daxishan Township.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:52.510
The Sun Family.

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:57.510
You think I'm bluffing?

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:00.000
That old jerk surnamed Sun

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:01.920
probably doesn't know

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:04.270
you're working here.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.000
I heard

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:09.880
he swore

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:11.240
if he ever found you,

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:13.350
he'd kill you.

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:15.630
So,

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:17.550
you still want to walk away?

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:42.680
Why aren't you replying?

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.920
Don't forget your task.

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.440
Any news, text me immediately.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.440
Or I'll kill you.

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:05.480
I'm watching you.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.310
Remember to call back.

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:43.800
Come in.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.030
Mr. Wang, you don't look great.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:03.520
So?

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.240
Decided yet?

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.030
On what?

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:09.680
What else?

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.270
How to solve the problem.

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:13.110
You wouldn't ask me here so early

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.350
just to drink tea, right?

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.160
Tea quenches thirst.

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:22.640
Not sure

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.720
if it quenches your thirst.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.270
Depends what kind of tea you brought.

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:42.720
An apartment in the city.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.000
And...

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.140
(Property Ownership Certificate)

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.680
Hongyun Restaurant.

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.030
That's some interesting tea.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.270
I know you're generous, Mr. Wang.

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:03.350
But this generous?

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.350
I'm afraid,

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:06.520
it's not just about settling

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:08.030
the issue between the two of us.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:12.880
Today,

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:14.550
the real point of this tea,

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:15.920
isn't the deal.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:18.920
It's an opportunity.

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:25.800
What kind of opportunity?

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:30.870
This time,

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.480
Bai used Zhang Ming to make trouble

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:35.880
to drive a wedge

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.920
between us

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.830
and to keep us under his thumb.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.440
But

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.680
I've run Hongyun for 15 years.

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:49.550
It's more than a place to eat.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.830
It's a business.

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:53.750
A cover.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.030
An identity.

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.000
A stepping stone.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.590
You two

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:04.720
have your goals.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:05.590
That's fine.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.030
I have mine too.

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:09.400
Then tell me straight.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.020
What do I get

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:12.590
out of this?

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:14.680
As long as Bai lives,

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.160
your resources stay scattered.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.200
You'll always answer to him.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.240
If he falls,

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.070
what you take over

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:30.480
isn't just a restaurant.

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:33.920
It's the whole board.

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:39.400
So you're not asking me

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.070
to clear out one man,

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.200
but to run the entire territory.

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:52.550
That's tempting.

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:54.190
But

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:56.160
are you really willing

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
to hand over everything

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:03.000
you built all these years?

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:05.510
I planned to leave with my daughter

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:06.720
to travel the world.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.510
This is a good moment.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.030
No wonder.

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:19.590
So the offer's on the table.

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:21.200
Whether you take it

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.790
depends on how ambitious you are.

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:30.950
Mr. Wang,

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.310
your mouth

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.880
is way sharper

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.550
than the tea you serve.

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.400
I'm just stating facts.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.310
You know it too.

00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:58.760
Deal.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.440
These days are your Lantern Festival.

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:33.200
I'll make you something nice to eat.

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:35.350
Not really my thing, though.

00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:38.510
The company wants to talk to you.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.160
Why? About what?

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:43.240
The livestream money I got from Li Xu...

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:45.310
I already wired it to the company.

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:47.920
The company's request.

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:54.720
The company's request.

00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:58.760
Now?

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:01.780
(Unknown Caller)

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:37.390
Yes.

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:38.870
I can hear you.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.160
No problems.

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.190
It's going smoothly.

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.920
I'll get more money.

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:48.350
This is just a small part.

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:50.800
Yes.

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.000
I have a new target.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:54.840
Don't worry.

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:01.000
Fifteen years

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:05.440
can change a person

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.200
completely.

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:12.440
Right?

00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:59.150
You're awake.

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:01.240
Sleep okay?

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.350
When did you get back?

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.200
You didn't come by these days.

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:08.400
I thought...

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.550
That I just left.

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:12.240
That I dumped you.

00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:13.670
Didn't need me anymore.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.680
So you could

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:17.400
cozy up

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.270
to Wang Li.

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:20.430
Is that it?

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.830
I'm your eyes and ears.

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:26.480
Taking your money,

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:28.550
putting on a show with him.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.070
So you know.

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:34.950
Sit.

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:53.870
I thought

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.830
you forgot who you work for.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.790
Living in the place I rented,

00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:00.160
doing the job I set up,

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.240
taking my pay,

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:03.670
and then

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:06.030
turning on me.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.590
I told you to keep an eye on them.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.040
Where are they?

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:31.590
They didn't come home.

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:33.350
So

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.270
you just stopped looking?

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.110
This place made you soft,

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:40.520
huh?

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:44.680
I really don't know.

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:47.680
They're not taking my calls.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.240
Call now.

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:08.380
(Ali; Calling)

00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:19.700
(Ali)

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:21.480
Hello, Li Tong.

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:26.840
Ali.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:29.670
Where are you and Yimo?

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:31.480
Last night,

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.230
I baked bread and brought it over.

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:35.230
You weren't home.

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:39.920
Family stuff.

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:41.760
We're at a relative's place.

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:43.360
It got late, so we didn't go back.

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.120
Is it serious?

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:48.280
Can you handle it?

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:49.680
Thanks.

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:52.280
We've got it. Don't worry.

00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:54.590
When will you be back?

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:57.110
Bread doesn't

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.240
keep long.

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:00.760
Not sure yet.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.070
Keep it for now.

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:04.920
Put it in the fridge.

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:06.920
I'll come get it

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:07.760
when we're home.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.280
Oh, right.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:11.320
It's windy at night.

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.230
Put on something warm.

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:16.090
Okay.

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:16.950
Thanks.

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:19.250
See you when you're back.

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.510
Ms. Tong, don't worry about us.

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:26.150
By the way, the scar cream I gave you...

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.240
Did you use it?

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:29.630
It might irritate at first.

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:30.630
Mild reaction.

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:32.320
Stick with it.

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:33.630
It works.

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:37.160
I've started using it.

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.160
Don't worry.

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:39.510
Good.

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:40.800
See you soon.

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:42.910
See you.

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.840
Seems you two aren't that close.

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.160
He goes places

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:51.590
without telling you.

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:53.960
They're both

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.510
very cautious.

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.030
Hard to trust anyone.

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:01.470
I think

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:03.510
they didn't tell me the truth.

00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:05.950
They're guarding against me.

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:10.470
Dad,

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:13.550
there's something

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:15.880
you won't want to hear.

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.320
But I have to tell you.

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.200
You're going to say

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:25.280
she was sent

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:28.030
by Bai to watch me.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:29.840
You knew?

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:34.480
How did you find out?

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:38.440
Remember when Li Tong got drunk?

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:41.150
Her presence never sat right with me.

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.190
A random neighbor,

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:45.840
suddenly all over you for no reason?

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:47.070
Especially

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:49.480
after you began to spiral.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.630
I suspected plenty of people,

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:53.710
her included.

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:03.940
(Wang Li was at the restaurant today.
He stayed home today)

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:05.440
(A business dinner)
But I couldn't figure out

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.800
(His daughter's back)
who was behind her

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.150
until that night at the restaurant,

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.110
when I saw the guy next to Bai.

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:15.200
But Dad,

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:17.110
if you knew all along,

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:18.800
why get so close to her?

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:26.840
Did you expose yourself?

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:31.000
No. I was careful.

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:32.680
This

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.360
is your only value.

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:40.510
If you mess this up...

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:42.030
I know the consequences.

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:44.800
What really happened

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.590
between you and Wang Li

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.030
that you hate him this much?

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:55.680
Curious, huh?

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:00.950
You're not

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.320
taking him out, are you?

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:40.000
Let's go back later.

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:42.280
Li Tong called already.

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:44.510
If we stay away too long,

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:46.960
Bai will get suspicious.

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.120
Right now,

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:50.670
we need him to think

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.150
he still controls us.

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:56.240
Okay.

00:38:58.110 --> 00:38:58.950
Dad,

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:00.920
you said you had a solution.

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:02.400
What is it?

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:05.880
Didn't we agree already?

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:08.350
From here on,

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:11.030
I'll handle it.

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:14.550
You stay out.

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:31.150
I noticed you

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:34.110
keep bumping into corners.

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:35.800
All bruised up.

00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:38.000
With these corner guards,

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:39.430
you won't

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.630
get hurt anymore.

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.920
Thanks, Ali.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:47.640
No need.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.230
If the restaurant were gone,

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:06.920
would you be disappointed?

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.320
That'd be good.

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.320
If it's gone,

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:13.190
the only thing tying you down is me.

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:15.510
We could go anywhere.

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:18.000
And you won't keep nagging

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.400
how the restaurant needs you.

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:23.510
Once this is over,
