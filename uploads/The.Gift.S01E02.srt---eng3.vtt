WEBVTT

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.800
You really expect me to believe

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.120
that you can see ghosts?

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.200
Help me…

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.160
I'll say the same thing.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.600
I have never known
the woman in your dream.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.120
So she's not my mother.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.240
Do you want to know
whether she was or not?

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.960
Why would you ask that?

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.960
She's right next to you now.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.800
Seriously?

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.880
Yeah.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.880
-Be serious.
-I'm serious.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.000
Left

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.600
or right?

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.520
You can't see her,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.160
but I can see her clearly…

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.520
Please. I'm scared enough
to be stuck here.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.560
Please go somewhere else.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.480
Uh…

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.000
Mr. Warat.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.680
It seems like she wants you
to help free something.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.000
Ugh.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.560
Please help free us first.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.800
Okay, so if she helps free us from here,

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.400
we'll help her too, right?

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.800
Then please let me out first.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.880
Hey! Don't promise things recklessly.
Are you crazy?

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.720
Is that clear?

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.000
I ran into a bit of trouble,
but I'm almost home. Tell Mom for me.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.640
Come on. Stop yelling.
We'll talk when I get home.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.920
Your family seems really close.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.200
There are only three of us. If we don't
love each other, who else would?

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.280
But don't change the subject.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.920
Let's figure out
how we could help Ms. Mysterious.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.400
We? I don't think so.
Sounds more like just you.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.680
How can you say that?
She helped you get out too, not just me.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.680
So we're both responsible together.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.120
I'll dedicate merit to her.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.480
What's wrong with you?
You keep changing the subject.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.480
Look, just because
I tolerate listening to you

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.000
doesn't mean I believe you 100%.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.200
I have to see it with my own eyes
before I'll believe it's real.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.640
Okay.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.640
Then I'll tell Ms. Mysterious
to go see you tonight, so you can believe.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.240
-You'll see her with your own eyes.
-No need.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.240
Oh?

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.120
Then what do I have to do for you
to believe and agree to help her?

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.760
I already told you I'll make merit.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.560
Thank you for bringing me home.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.080
-Is this your house?
-Yes.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.600
Uh, I'm an orphan.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.120
-Mama Toi, hello.
-Hello.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.520
-Oh.
-Come on.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.640
-This is Mama Toi, the owner of the house.
-Oh.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.360
Mom, this is Mr. Warat, the owner of

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.880
-the Vanich residence that I work for.
-Oh.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.040
Then please come inside.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.040
It's okay. It's late. I shouldn't
trouble you. I'll be going now.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.280
Thank you.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.040
Hurry up. Have you eaten yet?

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.680
-Kluay, why didn't you tell me you'd come?
-Hey.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.880
Well, Mrs. Wanee suddenly
called me in for an urgent meeting.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.880
Then don't you have a phone?
Why didn't you call me?

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.600
Well… why do you sound like
you didn't want me to come here?

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.400
Go see the Chairwoman.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.560
I'll wait. Call me when you're done.
Don't go anywhere until you see me. Okay?

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.400
-Got it?
-Alright.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.040
Why does it have to be this serious?

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.080
Ugh, go. I'll walk you there.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.720
Is something wrong, Som?

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.960
-Oh.
-Oh.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.360
Arnon, hello.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.960
-Oh, hello.
-Hello.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.200
-Oh, are you here on business?
-Yes.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.560
-And you, Som?
-Uh…

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.640
-Oh no, I'm out of time. We'll talk later.
-Okay.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.760
Arnon is a top lawyer here.
He works for Mr. Warat.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.560
Let's go. Hurry.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.720
There's nothing.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.320
Tell me now.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.280
I'm here.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.480
-Why did it take so long?
-Well…

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.160
I had to sneak out of the meeting.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.480
I had to make it look like
I didn't have outside business.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.760
I mean the information I asked you
to find, why did it take so long?

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.440
One day is long?

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.000
Every time in the past,

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.880
no matter what I asked you,
even if you didn't have the info,

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.640
you always tried to find something for me.
For example, the dog food.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.760
I wanted to do it,

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.920
you didn't have info,
so you took me to a veterinary hospital.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.560
Or stocks.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.480
You didn't have info,

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.480
but you found basic financial statements
for me to read.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.560
But it's strange.
When it comes to my mother,

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.960
you go silent and keep dodging it.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.480
Because this is more complicated
than anything we've dealt with.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.400
I think you should sit down first.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.240
After your mother passed away,

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.400
Mrs. Wanee took you into the main house

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.600
and dismissed all the staff,
a complete overhaul.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.000
And there was no news in the papers

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.640
since she never spoke to the media.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.040
There's only this,

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.960
news about Mr. Wichan, your father.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.560
And the wedding news?

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.200
A famous heir, yet the wedding
was kept completely quiet.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.080
What about that wedding photo?

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.720
Like I told you,

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.320
it's more complicated than you think.
The woman in the photo is not your mother.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.600
So who is she?
And why do you keep dreaming of her?

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.320
I forgot to tell you.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:44.000
Last night, I was trapped
in the rose arbor house with a woman…

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.520
named Kluay.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.600
Is my grandson alright now?

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.840
Yes. Mr. Warat has calmed down a lot.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.320
I'm glad the rose arbor house
wasn't demolished.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.400
Sooner or later,
it would've been demolished anyway.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.799
I'm just buying time now
because I don't want trouble with Warat.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.120
Thank you for helping us.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.200
If I wanted you

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.080
to stay and continue helping after
our contract ends, what would you say?

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.600
I…

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.000
Thank you very much, Mrs. Wanee.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:04.040
But I already have a new project lined up.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.280
Of course.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.160
Everyone wants to hire
someone as talented as you.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.600
But if there's anything
you need help with, just let me know.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.160
I'd be happy to help.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.680
It's like you can read my mind.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:22.080
How did you know
I was just about to ask for your help?

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.880
Come in.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.800
You called for me, Mom?

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.960
Stunned, huh?

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.200
Won't you say anything
about Kluay's mysterious sense?

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.160
I think things like spirits

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.720
or superstition

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.960
are pretty normal these days,
nothing exciting.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.760
Except…

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.080
something you encountered.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.000
Kluay encountered it. I didn't.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.440
Well, what about your dreams?

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.720
Alright. Let's do it both ways.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.680
We investigate
the real facts on one front,

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:10.760
and let that Ms. Mysterious
or whatever, help on the other.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:14.800
I really thought you weren't nonsensical
like most old people.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.800
-Guess I was wrong.
-Whoa, whoa.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.960
Thank you very much.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.280
Then why did you bother telling me
all this if you think it's nonsense?

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.960
I just wanted you to know that

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.040
I'm not the only one
experiencing strange things.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.120
That woman has to be
connected to me somehow.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.880
That's why we need her help.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.000
-A ghost, you mean?
-Exactly.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.920
No way. That's ridiculous.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.280
Mr. Warat.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:52.240
Because you already agreed
to help us with the work.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.000
Jirasin's engineering role

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.200
is to oversee technical
and construction matters

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.960
for all Vanich Group projects.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.240
And that includes the landscape work
that you're currently in charge of.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.760
Kluay already agreed

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.480
that she's willing to work with us.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.720
Well then, that's great.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.040
Thank you very much.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.120
Jirasin is like an adopted son to me.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.360
Helping him means helping me as well.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.080
Are you that stressed?

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.560
Sin.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.920
What's the rush? Stay and talk.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.560
I thought you didn't recognize me.
You were so quiet earlier.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.760
Uh, Sin…

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.040
I think

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.920
we should stop here.
Let's just go our separate ways.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.320
We already are going our separate ways.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.240
You're the one
who had the nerve to come work here.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:31.960
Good.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.520
I'll finally settle the score.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.280
Karma's caught up with you, you murderer.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.360
Wow.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.400
So this is the Chairwoman's favorite?

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:56.160
I never thought
you'd be so crude toward a woman.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.320
Mr. Warat, Kluay and I know each other.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.280
If you don't believe me, ask her
how we know each other.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:07.880
Dare to say it, Kluay?

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.360
What a gentleman.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.320
Looks like it's time to let Grandma
see just how gentlemanly you are.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.280
-Let's go see Grandma.
-Hey.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.200
Please stop. I don't want any trouble.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.360
Why?

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.040
Why be afraid of someone like this?
There's nothing scary about him at all.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.680
Mr. Warat, watch your words.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.920
Even if you're Mom's grandson,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.400
you don't get to belittle people.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.200
Mom?

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.080
You say that so easily.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.560
Since when did my grandmother
ever count you as her child?

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.240
Mr. Warat, don't despise me so much.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.840
You and I aren't that different.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:52.400
We're both kids with no parents,
living off Mrs. Wanee's charity.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.000
-But I'm not like you.
-How so?

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.040
Stay confident like this forever then.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:58.760
Jirasin!

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.640
-Get back here right now.
-Mr. Warat.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.160
-Let go of me.
-Hey, calm down.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.240
What's going on?

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:06.480
Mr. Arnon.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:11.480
I'm sorry for causing trouble
between you and Sin.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:15.760
You still respect someone
who harasses you like that?

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.680
I truly admire you.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.000
But next time,

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.320
if you stop me again, I'll come after you.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.520
Oh?

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.360
Wait, how could you take it out on her?

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.400
The one who caused the trouble
is Mr. Jirasin, not Ms. Kluay.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.640
It's fine. Let Mr. Warat
think whatever he wants.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:40.080
I'm going to finish the job at the
rose arbor house and leave Vanich anyway.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:44.280
As for helping Sin like Mrs. Wanee asked,

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.040
I'll have to find a way
to turn it down again.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:47.960
No.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.640
You have to keep working for me.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.800
Jirasin mocked me,

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.480
said I'm a kid with no parents.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.920
If he said that,
it means he knows something.

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.200
I need to find out who I am.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.360
You're not lying to me, right?

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.080
About the omen,
about the woman in the photo.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:16.000
Yes. Ms. Mysterious
really wants us to help.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.800
And I believe

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.840
she's connected to you.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.360
Then you have to stay
and help me investigate this.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:26.600
Can you?

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.840
See? If you had just called me,

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.880
I guarantee Jirasin would've been wrecked.

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.080
Ugh.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.840
Sin is stronger than before.
Don't fight with him, Som.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.880
Why doesn't he just sue us
and be done with it?

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.480
We didn't do anything,
yet he keeps forcing us to be guilty.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.400
This is insane.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.800
Well, Sin and Lakkana only had each other.

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.640
When Lak died,
of course Sin was devastated.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.800
But hasn't this gone on long enough?

00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:00.920
Som, help me think of a way
to turn down Mrs. Wanee's job.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.440
Ugh, what should I do?
How do I even tell her?

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.920
Just tell her Jirasin is crazy

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
and you can't work with him.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.360
Are you nuts, Som?

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.320
Ugh.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.320
I really wish I had
even a fraction of your boldness.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.640
Stop it. Being kind like this suits you.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.960
Let me handle being the villain.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:25.680
I'll help you think.
Your current contract is still ongoing.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.120
Then… you could just
ditch everything and run.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.320
Whoa. Are you crazy? How could I do that?

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.240
This doesn't work, that doesn't work.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.560
But I think you don't need to be afraid.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.560
You have Mr. Warat.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.000
Jirasin wouldn't dare challenge Warat,
the real grandson.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.760
But I haven't agreed yet to help him.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.400
But you already promised…

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.680
Ms. Mysterious, didn't you?

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.839
Aunt Nong, I'm back.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.520
Hey, Sin, when you're free,

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.600
come help me fix the storage room door.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:35.440
I just fixed it last week.
It's broken again already? What is this?

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.360
It wasn't very sturdy,

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.360
so I bought a new one to replace it.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.680
And what's wrong with you, Sin?
Where's this bad mood coming from?

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.480
It's Warat. Just like you said,
he's really playing the big shot.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.400
Sin, you ran into Warat already?

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.840
Sin, you should get close to Warat.
Build a relationship with him.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:05.200
If Mrs. Wanee legally adopts you,

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:09.320
you should get to know him
and don't fight with him.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.600
But I don't really agree with that.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:16.280
Why does Sin have to
rely on Warat so much?

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:20.440
Everything Sin achieved at Vanich,

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.680
he did on his own.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.720
Sin's capable.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.360
That's why Mrs. Wanee favors him.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.320
He oversees all engineering at Vanich.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.040
She'd be stupid not to keep
someone that talented.

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.920
Alright, alright.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.960
Just don't say I didn't warn you
when the time comes.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:47.200
No matter what, Warat is going to
end up in charge of Vanich.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.960
Sin is like my own nephew.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.560
Everything I've said is out of goodwill.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:57.120
Yes.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.080
Ah, look at him.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.200
Aren't you eating?

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.360
I'm annoyed.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.000
No matter how much time passes,
I'll never understand.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.400
Warat is just an ex-lover's child.

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.880
Why does Uncle Rut care about him so much?

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:31.040
No matter how many times you ask,
I can only say I don't know.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:36.080
All I know is that Warat
is Praewilai's son,

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.320
the woman he loved so much.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.000
He probably wants us

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:46.520
to love Warat
the same way he loved Praewilai.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:50.560
A horrible woman like Praewilai,
who destroyed my family,

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.160
will never be loved by anyone.

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:57.960
How dare he tell me
to treat her son like family?

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:02.160
Let's put Uncle Rut's story aside for now.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.160
If you dwell on everything,

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:08.400
we'll never move forward.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.800
Alright.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.720
But as of now,

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.440
Mrs. Wanee

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.200
is paying

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:23.280
for what her daughter
Praewilai did to your family.

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.400
And she's doing exactly
what she said she would.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:32.160
Mrs. Wanee always tells everyone
that I'm like her adopted son.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.040
Just "like."

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.360
But not truly one yet.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.920
I've never forgotten what I need to do.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.120
The Vanichs
will pay us back to the very end.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.520
Hearing that…

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.920
I can't help thinking of your mother.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:53.960
When that day comes,

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.720
Naree will finally rest in peace.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.880
Kluay, Kluay, wake up.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.280
Ms. Mysterious, please let me sleep.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.440
I'll dedicate merit to you.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.720
Don't want merit?

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:56.160
If you don't want merit,
then what do you want?

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.200
Help me.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:02.120
I want to help, really, but…

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.800
Help me.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.400
Kluay, are you awake, dear?

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.400
Uh…

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.480
Ms. Mysterious, please go for now.

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.440
I don't want Mama Toi to see you.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.400
Help me.

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:18.400
Kluay, who are you talking to?
Open the door for me.

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:19.320
Help me.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.320
Kluay. Kluay.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.240
Okay, fine, I'll help. But for now,

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.800
please go.

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.440
-Kluay, is something wrong?
-Uh…

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.720
No, Mom.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.560
Alright, go back to sleep.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:41.920
Okay.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.640
Why did I even promise her?

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.320
Why are there two sets?

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.360
Mr. Warat ordered them.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.360
What was he thinking?

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.720
Then add his favorite passion fruit
and carrot juice for him too.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:15.760
Yes, ma'am.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.880
-Good morning, Grandma.
-Oh.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.120
Warat.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.560
Thank you for having breakfast
with me today.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.600
Not just today, Grandma.

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.960
From now on, I'll have breakfast
with you every morning.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.680
And I'll go to the Vanich office as well.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.600
You should've thought this way
a long time ago.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.320
I'm really happy. Thank you, dear.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.040
You should thank Jirasin.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.360
He's the reason I decided
to step in and take care of Vanich

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.680
before everything gets taken over.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.480
Lately, the majority shareholders

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.920
have been acquaintances of Jirasin.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.240
Don't you find that strange?

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.880
His pawns?

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.480
I don't have solid proof yet,

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.520
but I don't think it's anything else.

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.320
But if

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.800
the majority shareholders
are Jirasin's people,

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.480
that means the position of

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.480
the next Chair of Vanich

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:26.200
could be in Jirasin's hands.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.800
He could be selected.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.520
Isn't that a bit too easy?

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.840
That's the company's rules and traditions.

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.160
But I think it's time.

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.440
What do you think I should do?

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:46.400
Whatever I say,
you never believe me anyway.

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.520
That's why I have to act, so you can see.

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:55.240
Jirasin is just doing his job,
following the assignments I gave him.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.680
Don't overthink it, Rat.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.880
Besides, I still

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:02.240
owe a lot to his family.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.480
Another thing I don't know about.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.400
Because it has nothing to do with you.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:11.520
Why would I burden you with troubles?

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.600
It's funny, Grandma.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.960
It's your own story,
yet I have no right to know it.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.000
As if I weren't really your grandson.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.720
Stop it right now, Warat.

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:26.000
You have no right
to raise your voice at me.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.600
It's you

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.400
-who should stop thinking this way.
-Warat.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.320
You talked about my rights, didn't you?

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.680
Then it should be me

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:40.320
who gets to choose
what I should or shouldn't do,

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.360
not you drawing the lines for me.

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.040
How many people whose lives

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:49.840
-you've drawn for and ended up ruined?
-Stop it right now, Warat!

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.760
From now on,

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.560
whether I do something or not

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.960
won't be because you order me to.

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.000
I'll do things

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.840
because it's what I should do.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.440
This area is almost done.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.320
Just a little finishing work,
and we should be able to hand it over.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.920
I think no later than Friday.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.480
-Yes.
-Okay.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.400
-Alright. Thank you.
-Yes.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:26.360
Hey.

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.240
I was just about to go find you.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.160
I didn't want to see you.

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.840
Not even a minute,
and you're already picking a fight?

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.680
If you have something to say,
say it quickly.

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:42.360
Do you want to listen or not?

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.760
Whatever.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:45.880
Hey.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.720
Ms. Mysterious came to see me.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:52.160
And last night, I promised I'd help her.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:53.640
That's good.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:57.160
It's good that I get to help her
and help with your mother's matter.

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.560
But it's not good
that I'll have to see Sin.

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:01.760
Why?

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:04.520
So you're saying

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.120
I look pathetic that I can't protect you?

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.360
-That's not what I meant.
-Then,

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:17.080
don't mention that bastard again.
I don't want to hear his name. Okay?

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.480
Okay.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.120
Come on. Let's get to work.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:25.800
I can't today. I'm very busy.
I have a lot to clear up here first.

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:29.280
This is my house.
So there's no need to rush.

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:34.520
-Mr. Warat.
-Go.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:35.600
Ow.

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.480
What's wrong?

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:49.640
Are you okay?

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.560
I… I saw…

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:57.360
I saw you injured.

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.920
Did I die?

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.240
Huh?

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.160
Ah, okay.

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.280
If it's not deadly, then it's fine.
Let's go.

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:08.480
Hey, why would you say
something like that?

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:11.440
Well, hurry up and go see Mr. Arnon.

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:16.320
So we can investigate what really happened
and find actual evidence.

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.520
Come.

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.840
-No need. I can walk on my own.
-Okay.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.080
There goes my work day…

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:41.000
This room used to be

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:45.600
where our legal department stored
all of Vanich's important documents.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.240
But after moving to the new building,
this room was vacant.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:53.000
So I planned to turn this place
into our secret meeting room.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.400
It's like we're some kind
of secret organization.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.360
Something like that.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.760
HELPED A BEDRIDDEN PATIENT

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:06.080
That's Dad.

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:09.440
This is a society page newspaper article.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.360
It must be from before you were born.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.720
I found it at the newspaper archive.

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:15.720
Alright, let's do this

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:20.280
slowly at first, so we don't lose our way.

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:22.920
This is Mrs. Praewilai,

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.960
your mother.
She died by falling off a building.

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.920
Back then, you must have been very young,

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.320
too young to remember anything.

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.160
I don't understand.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:37.120
Why did everyone hide the truth
about my mother from me?

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.680
At home,
there isn't a single photo of her.

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:43.040
This is the first time I've ever
seen her picture. How pathetic.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.400
That's what we still have to find out.

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:47.800
They hid the truth about my mother,

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.960
yet openly revealed
that my father married another woman,

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.160
your Ms. Mysterious.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.280
Oh?

00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:00.680
Mine? You dream about her too, don't you?

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:05.600
I think this woman must have been
someone Mr. Wichan loved very much.

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.960
Otherwise, the photo
would've been destroyed already,

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.280
certainly by Mrs. Wanee.

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.720
I already told you that Grandma ordered

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.520
everything at the rose arbor house
to be thrown away.

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:21.560
I think that included
these photos as well.

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.400
If we still have the photo,

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.880
we can make use of it.

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.560
I took a photo of it.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.120
Oh.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.480
Then why didn't you tell me?

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.200
You didn't ask.

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:51.840
That woman

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.360
married Dad.

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:58.840
Then why does she appear in my dreams?

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:05.440
Or could she actually be your mother?

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.560
I think it's possible.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:11.320
Otherwise, she wouldn't
have appeared in your dreams for decades.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:15.280
The fact that she's followed you
for so many years

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:17.480
might mean

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.960
she wanted to meet…

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.040
Ms. Kluay.

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:27.200
No, it's not like that.
I'm just a medium, Mr. Arnon.

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:28.800
That's exactly it.

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:31.960
Maybe Ms. Mysterious

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.400
has been waiting for both of you.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.320
I won't say I'm happy about that.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:46.160
Kluay, you have to take responsibility
for what you promised her.

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.040
Twice already. The first time

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.560
was at the rose arbor house.

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.520
The second time, you can't escape it now.

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.760
I never planned to run away.

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.280
Let's say I'll just do my best.

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:02.080
Grandma didn't leave any
of the old staff for us to question.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.480
What should we do next?

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:11.440
There is nothing in this world
that moves without leaving a trace.

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:15.520
Why didn't I think of this
back when I was at my father's funeral?

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.360
There had to be someone there who knew.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.840
We still have the 100-day merit ceremony.

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.560
Right.

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.880
Oh.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.760
Even though there may not be

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:29.240
as many guests as at the funeral,

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:33.560
I believe we can still find clues
from the guests or from Ms. Mysterious.

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.240
Yes.

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:52.000
With so few guests,
will we really get anything?

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:56.840
Mrs. Wanee only invited
close acquaintances.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.360
Don't feel discouraged yet.

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.640
We might find something very important.

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:05.960
Okay.

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.960
I'll head over there first then.

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:11.040
Sure.

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.200
I'm fine, thank you.

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.040
Yes.

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:16.880
Yes.

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.000
May I help you?

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:18.920
Sure.

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:37.160
Where are you going?
Do you really think I want to see you?

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:40.600
Uh.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:44.400
Excuse me, I'll go help out.

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:51.160
I was just asking where Mrs. Wanee is.

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:59.960
Mrs. Wanee is… over there.

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:02.800
What's going on?

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:16.480
Hello, Mr. Warat.
Please accept my condolences once again.

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.480
I told you already, didn't I?

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:22.440
If anyone behaves badly toward you,
report it to me immediately.

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:25.080
Today is an important day for your father.

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:29.920
I think you should learn to let go,
at least for one day.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.840
Even I, an outsider, know

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.040
that I should avoid conflict today.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.440
Get lost before I lose my patience.

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:45.520
Alright.
I don't have much time today anyway.

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:48.280
I need to take an important guest
to see Mrs. Wanee.

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:06.240
Wait, wait.

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.560
Wait. Stop.

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.600
-Sin.
-Yes.

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:17.960
That man is Wichan's son, right?

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:20.480
Yes. That's Warat.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.800
Should we go talk to Mrs. Wanee first?

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:36.080
She might not even welcome us.

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:38.880
Don't forget we're uninvited guests.

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.200
Let's go.

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.160
Uh.

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.000
Who is that?

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:51.880
I don't know,

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:54.960
but it feels strange.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.520
Thank you. Please, go ahead.

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.080
Oh, Jirasin.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.920
I must apologize
for not helping since early this morning.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.160
It's fine.

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.960
I was just asking Supol about you.

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.960
I was wondering where you were.

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.760
Mom, uh…

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:15.920
There are guests who wish to attend,
but they weren't invited.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.400
So I brought them to you first
to see if you'd be okay with it.

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:23.800
They wanted to attend this?

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.320
-Yes.
-Who are they?

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.640
Hello, ma'am.

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.320
Please accept my condolences.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:40.800
Thank you.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.160
Mom, this is

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:47.120
Aunt Anong, my biological aunt.
And this is Uncle Sarut,

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.960
my uncle-in-law.

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:55.160
I didn't think
you cared about Wichan's affairs,

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:57.000
so I didn't invite you.

00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.240
If you could abandon your wife and child,

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.560
then our friendship ends there.

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:04.800
Go ahead.

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:09.240
You wanna end our friendship
over this? You don't know me at all.

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:13.360
Go ahead.
You get to play the saint all by yourself.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.440
-Sarut!
-Yeah! Why?

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:17.520
Stop, both of you.

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.120
It's alright.

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.800
I hesitated for a long time about coming,

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.240
worried I might disturb you.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.680
But after thinking it through,

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:31.040
this is a major merit-making ceremony.
The 100-day merit

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:34.080
is the final act of merit
dedicated to the deceased.

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.600
Wichan was my friend.

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:41.040
So I came to pay my respects.

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:45.200
Thank you on Wichan's behalf.

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.280
-Take good care of the guests, Sin.
-Yes, Mom.

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:54.720
Sin, take me to meet Wichan's son.

00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:58.040
Yes.

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.040
That's him?

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.440
Jirasin's important guest?

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.560
I think there's definitely
something hidden,

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.000
some ulterior motive.

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.280
That's why he brings strangers

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:26.160
into an event like this.

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:33.960
What did you see?

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.240
NEXT EPISODE

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.840
But there must be something

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:41.640
that made those two

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:44.400
choose to appear at today's ceremony.

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.080
If you do anything to Kluay,

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:48.880
it's the same as doing it to me.

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:54.040
Because right now, we're dating.

00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:58.560
This girl?

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:26.080
