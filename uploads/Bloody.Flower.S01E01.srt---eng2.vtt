Hey, you think this is all on me?
That's on you for lending it to me.

Goodness, you're just can't stop talking.

Who on earth are you?

00:01:41.507 --> 00:01:42.777
I said, "Who are you?"

Hey, Prosecutor Cha.
Why did you come all the way in here?

00:04:29.847 --> 00:04:33.217
You promised you'd just watch.
It's dangerous. All right?

00:04:34.017 --> 00:04:36.247
Don't be difficult.
Please go back outside.

00:04:36.817 --> 00:04:38.587
This isn't even your case, Prosecutor Cha.

You're here much earlier than I expected.

00:05:36.507 --> 00:05:38.047
Could you give me five more minutes?

00:05:38.647 --> 00:05:40.177
I'm still treating a patient.

00:05:42.687 --> 00:05:43.717
Would you like to see?

00:05:44.017 --> 00:05:46.117
- What are you doing? Don't move.
- No, I'll be done in a second.

00:05:46.187 --> 00:05:47.557
I said, "Don't move!"

00:05:49.017 --> 00:05:51.487
All right. I'll stay perfectly still.

00:05:53.257 --> 00:05:55.257
Drop what's in your hand
and cooperate with us.

00:05:59.967 --> 00:06:00.967

will be used as evidence.

Get the forensics team in here
and tend to the victim.

Don't let anyone else
operate on the patient.

What was that?

00:06:32.667 --> 00:06:34.937
If my surgical methods get mixed up
with another's,

00:06:35.837 --> 00:06:37.407
they'll never recover.

00:06:38.437 --> 00:06:39.777
What are you talking about?

00:06:40.777 --> 00:06:43.607
You wouldn't understand
even if I explained it now.

00:06:45.577 --> 00:06:47.077
I'm telling you, don't let them get
any other treatment.

00:06:48.777 --> 00:06:49.987
You went to great lengths to find him.

00:06:50.687 --> 00:06:51.787

- Is it true a large settlement was paid?

00:07:56.287 --> 00:07:58.347
Why are you denying the use of a weapon
during the assault?

00:07:58.547 --> 00:08:00.517
Did you even give the victim
a proper apology?

00:08:00.857 --> 00:08:02.887
I've cooperated fully
with the police investigation.

00:08:03.527 --> 00:08:05.087
I apologize for the concern I've caused.

on the situation!

Excuse me. One moment, everyone!

This case has been closed
with no charges filed.

00:08:17.567 --> 00:08:19.637
That's enough, all right?

00:08:19.837 --> 00:08:22.377
But the CCTV footage confirms the assault,
doesn't it?

00:08:23.677 --> 00:08:25.707
Please have some faith
in the police investigation.

00:08:27.147 --> 00:08:30.517

You're a total lifesaver.

00:08:44.597 --> 00:08:48.697
No, really. I had faith in you
from the very beginning.

00:08:51.807 --> 00:08:54.977
You only got away with it
because it's your first offense.

Assault, drugs.

One little spark, and this all
blows up in your face. Got it?

00:09:02.247 --> 00:09:04.547
Yes, that's what I'm paying you
the big bucks for.

00:09:05.747 --> 00:09:06.757
That's what you're paying for?

Mr. Park,

I can get my hands on
the treatment for Batten disease.

00:10:11.947 --> 00:10:14.817
But the procedures for getting it
are extremely strict.

00:10:16.327 --> 00:10:18.387
Since it's a treatment for
a rare genetic disorder,

00:10:18.887 --> 00:10:20.857
you're aware the bidding costs are high,
aren't you?

00:10:21.397 --> 00:10:25.027
I know. I'll get the money,
no matter what it takes.

00:10:28.097 --> 00:10:29.567
I should tell you upfront.

00:10:30.437 --> 00:10:32.137
You have to be prepared
for the side effects.

I haven't told her yet.

Just a moment.

Would you take a look at this?

00:10:51.787 --> 00:10:54.627
It's a treatment for genetic disorders
being developed by a domestic company.

00:10:56.157 --> 00:10:58.797
It has also shown a positive response
in patients with Batten disease.

00:10:59.597 --> 00:11:02.237
It also recently passed clinical trials
on children.

00:11:02.797 --> 00:11:04.767
Now, it's still in the approval phase,

00:11:05.367 --> 00:11:07.507

in this early project,

00:11:07.807 --> 00:11:09.207

Any case she sets her sights on is ours.

With her background
as the youngest daughter of Sejin Group,

why does she make things
so hard for herself?

00:13:23.677 --> 00:13:26.147
I'm sure being passed over for promotion
was a big blow.

00:13:26.207 --> 00:13:29.577
What's the big deal?
She won't be a prosecutor forever.

00:13:30.347 --> 00:13:33.887
She could just coast for a while,
get a boost from her father,

00:13:34.357 --> 00:13:37.887
and land a cushy job as chief counsel
on the Sejin Group's legal team.

tarnish her father's name.

The comparisons must be brutal.

So what's the second reason?

00:13:57.977 --> 00:13:59.247
I guess it's just her nature.

Hello.

- I have a pretty good memory.
- That's good.

00:14:52.627 --> 00:14:54.337
Because I have
quite a few questions for you.

00:14:55.537 --> 00:14:56.607
Back at the crime scene,

00:14:57.067 --> 00:14:59.607
you told me you were
treating the victim, correct?

00:14:59.877 --> 00:15:02.707
Yes. He was a terminal cancer patient.

00:15:03.477 --> 00:15:06.247
By the time he came to me,
the cancer had already spread quite a bit.

00:15:06.777 --> 00:15:07.817
So I...

00:15:08.417 --> 00:15:09.777
Let's save that story for later.

What?

00:15:12.217 --> 00:15:13.387
But you're the one who asked.

00:15:15.557 --> 00:15:17.487
I was just confirming whether or not
you intended to kill him.

00:15:18.627 --> 00:15:20.657
All right, then.
Let's go through this step-by-step.

00:15:21.297 --> 00:15:23.867
What was all that stuff
in the refrigerator?

00:15:25.127 --> 00:15:26.227
You already saw what was in there.

00:15:28.767 --> 00:15:32.637
I'm asking you why you did it.
I want a clear explanation.

00:15:40.247 --> 00:15:41.377
It's for research purposes.

00:15:42.717 --> 00:15:44.817

The dismembered bodies.

00:15:51.427 --> 00:15:52.727
What kind of research?

00:15:56.457 --> 00:15:58.067
You're asking because you're
actually curious, right?

00:15:58.367 --> 00:16:01.237
- Why do you ask?
- The detectives didn't believe me.

00:16:02.597 --> 00:16:05.837
I'll have to hear it to judge, won't I?
What was the research?

00:16:07.237 --> 00:16:09.837
I was developing a cure
for incurable diseases.

00:16:10.377 --> 00:16:11.447
Incurable diseases?

00:16:11.807 --> 00:16:14.017
A cure that can overcome any disease.

00:16:14.547 --> 00:16:15.617
That's the kind of cure I was making.

00:16:16.377 --> 00:16:19.087
But to see if the cure actually works,

00:16:19.747 --> 00:16:23.527
- I needed a living human body.
- So, like a clinical trial?

00:16:23.787 --> 00:16:26.757
Yes. So I conducted experiments on people.

00:16:29.897 --> 00:16:32.727
Did you kill them during the experiments,
or...

00:16:33.227 --> 00:16:35.997
did you experiment on them
after you killed them?

00:16:39.167 --> 00:16:41.807
Since they died
after I administered the cure...

00:16:42.407 --> 00:16:43.407
No, that's not it.

00:16:43.807 --> 00:16:45.947
I think I administered the cure
after I killed them.

00:16:50.347 --> 00:16:52.217
It really depends on the situation.

00:16:52.987 --> 00:16:53.987
It's case-by-case.

00:16:55.917 --> 00:16:56.927
Fine.

00:16:57.987 --> 00:17:00.197
That's for the autopsy to determine.

00:17:01.697 --> 00:17:03.097
How many victims are there?

00:17:03.467 --> 00:17:04.527
Prosecutor Cha.

00:17:05.667 --> 00:17:08.597
How long are you going to keep asking
these pointless questions?

00:17:09.767 --> 00:17:12.667
I'm telling you I was developing a cure.
Aren't you curious about that?

00:17:13.537 --> 00:17:14.707
In an investigation,

00:17:15.177 --> 00:17:17.277
the first step is to establish
the scale of the crime.

00:17:19.477 --> 00:17:20.647
Now, tell me.

00:17:22.247 --> 00:17:24.917
The DNA analysis suggests
there are more victims.

00:17:25.447 --> 00:17:26.787
Where are these people?

00:17:27.387 --> 00:17:28.487
I'm sure they're around somewhere.

00:17:29.057 --> 00:17:30.057
Did you kill them?

00:17:30.287 --> 00:17:31.527
Come on, Prosecutor Cha.

00:17:32.257 --> 00:17:35.027
- You can't just keep demanding answers.
- I'm asking you, did you kill them?

00:17:36.997 --> 00:17:39.297
- It's the same as not killing them.
- Lee Woo Gyeom!

00:17:40.567 --> 00:17:43.507
We found more than five dismembered bodies
at the scene.

00:17:44.907 --> 00:17:45.907
And...

00:17:46.567 --> 00:17:49.207
they are the bodies
of the missing victims, aren't they?

00:18:02.057 --> 00:18:03.257
Here, take a look at this.

00:18:12.067 --> 00:18:14.037
(17-17)

00:18:15.397 --> 00:18:17.007
You know the answer, right?

00:18:17.807 --> 00:18:20.437
Just tell me what you see.

00:18:21.437 --> 00:18:23.807
Stop wasting my time. What's your point?

00:18:23.947 --> 00:18:26.407
You're the one wasting time.

00:18:27.347 --> 00:18:30.317
If we can't get on the same page,
how can this investigation get anywhere?

00:18:36.987 --> 00:18:38.857
- Zero.
- Exactly.

00:18:41.957 --> 00:18:45.527
I killed 17 people,
but in return, I saved the world.

00:18:45.627 --> 00:18:47.497
So in the end, the death toll is zero.

00:18:52.307 --> 00:18:54.807
It's as if I didn't kill a single person.

00:19:15.557 --> 00:19:17.167
(Police)

00:19:17.227 --> 00:19:18.227
Yes, Prosecutor Cha.

00:19:18.727 --> 00:19:21.997
- We found them.
- Lee Woo Gyeom has 17 victims.

00:19:22.197 --> 00:19:24.667
What? Seventeen victims?

00:19:25.937 --> 00:19:29.037
At the crime scene of Lee Woo Gyeom,
who was arrested yesterday,

00:19:29.037 --> 00:19:33.207
seven bodies have been discovered
out of a total of seventeen victims.

00:19:33.747 --> 00:19:37.647
Police are determining the time of death
and identify the bodies...

00:19:40.957 --> 00:19:41.957
Good.

00:19:46.587 --> 00:19:48.727
- Min Seo.
- Dad,

00:19:49.427 --> 00:19:51.197
Where have you been?

00:19:56.537 --> 00:19:57.537
Here you go.

00:20:04.277 --> 00:20:05.307
Let me know when you're heading out.

00:20:05.877 --> 00:20:06.877
Okay.

00:20:20.357 --> 00:20:21.497
So, Min Seo...

00:20:23.357 --> 00:20:24.527
You love dolls that much?

00:20:25.167 --> 00:20:28.067
- Yes.
- I know you love your dolls,

00:20:28.867 --> 00:20:30.167
but it's also good to go outside...

00:20:30.167 --> 00:20:31.837
- and play with your friends.
- But I don't have any friends.

00:20:33.737 --> 00:20:35.907
I was only at school for a week.

00:20:37.607 --> 00:20:38.607
I know.

00:20:40.977 --> 00:20:42.217
It's okay, Dad.

00:20:44.387 --> 00:20:45.617
Min Seo,

00:20:46.217 --> 00:20:49.217
once you're all better,
you're going to make so many friends.

00:20:49.517 --> 00:20:53.597
Dad will send you to middle school,
high school, and...

00:20:54.357 --> 00:20:55.957
I'll even send you abroad to study.

00:20:56.757 --> 00:20:59.127
- Really?
- Of course I mean it.

00:20:59.727 --> 00:21:02.597
Pinky promise? Promise.

00:21:07.407 --> 00:21:09.107
- Dad.
- Yes?

00:21:10.347 --> 00:21:11.347
Can't we all...

00:21:12.547 --> 00:21:13.617
live together again...

00:21:14.877 --> 00:21:16.147
like we used to?

00:21:20.757 --> 00:21:21.757
Of course.

00:21:22.887 --> 00:21:24.057
Of course we will.

00:21:41.707 --> 00:21:44.577
(Reporter Jo Woo Cheol, Daehan Ilbo News)

00:21:46.047 --> 00:21:48.377
Well, look who it is.
Long time no see.

00:21:50.317 --> 00:21:51.417
(It's not too late for the Prosecution...)

00:21:51.487 --> 00:21:52.517
(to stop the false charges and listen.)

00:22:03.827 --> 00:22:04.827
Reporter Jo.

00:22:06.267 --> 00:22:07.267
Well, hey!

00:22:11.207 --> 00:22:13.207
- How long has it been?
- It's been way too long.

00:22:13.267 --> 00:22:14.977
- Have a seat.
- No, please, you have a seat.

00:22:22.417 --> 00:22:24.447
- Here, I haven't touched this one.
- No, it's fine.

00:22:24.847 --> 00:22:26.017
I had something on the way.

00:22:29.787 --> 00:22:30.827
So, Reporter Jo.

00:22:31.357 --> 00:22:34.697
Why did you suddenly leave the paper
when you were doing so well?

00:22:35.997 --> 00:22:37.067
Don't get me started.

00:22:37.567 --> 00:22:40.097
Remember last year when I clashed
with the Prosecution?

00:22:40.497 --> 00:22:45.107
Well, after that, I lost all my sources,
got hit with a lawsuit, and was terrified.

00:22:45.537 --> 00:22:49.037
I still have to support my wife, right?
So I just started my own thing.

00:22:50.807 --> 00:22:52.347
So, how's it working out for you?

00:22:52.977 --> 00:22:55.447
Well, it's a relief not having to
walk on eggshells around the higher-ups,

00:22:56.147 --> 00:22:57.617
but the money's just not there.

00:23:02.487 --> 00:23:05.757
I've been following the Jeffrey case.
He's a famous producer, isn't he?

00:23:05.857 --> 00:23:09.227
I never imagined you'd be the one
to take his case.

00:23:10.397 --> 00:23:13.567
A man's got to feed his family.

00:23:16.067 --> 00:23:17.637
So here I am.

00:23:18.867 --> 00:23:20.237
So, Mr. Park.

00:23:21.007 --> 00:23:22.307
How about you and I...

00:23:22.577 --> 00:23:24.707
work on something
that'll help us both get by?

00:23:25.577 --> 00:23:26.577
A case?

00:23:31.817 --> 00:23:33.287
You've seen the news
about Lee Woo Gyeom, right?

00:23:33.687 --> 00:23:37.587
The serial killer who murdered 17 people?
He wants to hire you.

00:23:38.657 --> 00:23:40.857
The retainer has nine zeroes.

00:23:42.827 --> 00:23:47.667
Man, for that kind of money,
he could hire a big-name law firm.

00:23:47.737 --> 00:23:49.397
He'd have a much better shot
with them than with me.

00:23:50.137 --> 00:23:54.077
We can't have that.
I'm the one connecting you to him,

00:23:54.707 --> 00:23:56.177
so I need to get my finder's fee.

00:23:56.937 --> 00:23:57.977
Just kidding.

00:23:58.577 --> 00:23:59.877
Apparently, Lee Woo Gyeom has a reason...

00:24:01.077 --> 00:24:02.977
why it absolutely has to be you.

00:24:04.117 --> 00:24:05.117
And what reason is that?

00:24:07.217 --> 00:24:10.187
He said you'd know what it's about
if I mentioned Moon Se Guk.

00:24:12.327 --> 00:24:15.757
I can get you the treatment
for Batten disease.

00:24:16.197 --> 00:24:18.067
It's just that the procedure
is incredibly complicated.

00:24:24.567 --> 00:24:25.837
He knows Moon Se Guk?

00:24:26.507 --> 00:24:28.237
Yes. I heard it
from Lee Woo Gyeom himself.

00:24:32.647 --> 00:24:34.047
How in the world does he know Moon Se Guk?

00:24:34.517 --> 00:24:36.547
He said Moon Se Guk
was one of his victims.

00:24:41.757 --> 00:24:43.187
He killed him? Lee Woo Gyeom did?

00:24:43.987 --> 00:24:47.627
- Sir, did you call for a driver? Sir.
- Seriously.

00:24:47.697 --> 00:24:50.127
But why would Lee Woo Gyeom
kill Moon Se Guk?

00:24:56.797 --> 00:24:59.067
He wouldn't tell me the details.

00:25:03.577 --> 00:25:04.577
Damn it.

00:25:09.577 --> 00:25:12.317
Arrange a meeting for me with him.

00:25:20.557 --> 00:25:24.167
Section Chief Bang, get all the case files
on Lee Woo Gyeom from Detective Gong.

00:25:24.397 --> 00:25:27.237
But I heard they'll pick which department
gets that case after the meeting today.

00:25:27.297 --> 00:25:29.997
Exactly. And after that meeting,
it's going to be ours.

00:25:33.977 --> 00:25:35.037
What was that?

00:25:35.707 --> 00:25:37.847
I told you yesterday
I was going to land this case.

00:25:39.847 --> 00:25:41.677
I meant that I understood.

00:25:47.917 --> 00:25:51.827
Manager Lee, schedule an interrogation
with Lee Woo Gyeom for this afternoon.

00:25:52.087 --> 00:25:53.187
Yes, right away.

00:25:56.827 --> 00:25:58.527
- Prosecutor Cha.
- Yes?

00:25:58.667 --> 00:26:00.997
He has a meeting scheduled
with his attorney this afternoon.

00:26:02.897 --> 00:26:03.937
His attorney?

00:26:06.037 --> 00:26:07.107
Yes, come on in.

00:26:12.677 --> 00:26:14.577
I was just heading out. Let's go.

00:26:15.277 --> 00:26:17.787
I need to talk to you before the meeting.

00:26:19.287 --> 00:26:20.287
All right, have a seat.

00:26:30.767 --> 00:26:31.927
About the Lee Woo Gyeom case...

00:26:32.527 --> 00:26:33.727
Please assign it to me.

00:26:34.967 --> 00:26:36.597
What's the big rush?

00:26:36.867 --> 00:26:39.107
I did all the legwork
to bring this case in myself.

00:26:39.807 --> 00:26:43.947
I spent my whole paycheck schmoozing
the detectives at Guam Police Station.

00:26:44.047 --> 00:26:47.417
Give me a break.
Since when you worry about money?

00:26:48.477 --> 00:26:49.477
I know you missed the promotion,

00:26:49.547 --> 00:26:51.247
and that's why
you're acting like this, but...

00:26:52.247 --> 00:26:56.217
Prosecutor Cha, don't focus on cases,
but your peer reviews.

00:26:56.817 --> 00:26:59.957
Those reviews aren't because
I did something wrong.

00:27:00.727 --> 00:27:03.397
I know. They're all just jealous.

00:27:03.967 --> 00:27:07.267
Some crazy kid just walks away
from her dad's perfectly good company,

00:27:07.467 --> 00:27:10.937
rejects a match with a conglomerate heir,
and doesn't care what her superiors think.

00:27:11.307 --> 00:27:12.907
You live your life saying
whatever is on your mind.

00:27:13.207 --> 00:27:14.277
How could they not be jealous?

00:27:14.407 --> 00:27:18.077
That's exactly why I should take it.
I have no conflicts, so I would be clean.

00:27:18.447 --> 00:27:19.447
No.

00:27:20.307 --> 00:27:21.677
If only for the media attention,

00:27:21.947 --> 00:27:23.547
it has to be someone with
Prosecutor Kim's experience.

00:27:23.987 --> 00:27:26.487
Even with Park Han Jun
as the defense attorney?

00:27:27.817 --> 00:27:28.817
What?

00:27:29.757 --> 00:27:32.687
- Park Han Jun? From the CIU?
- You know the one.

00:27:33.087 --> 00:27:35.927
He won landmark unfair labor,
harassment, and injury cases...

00:27:35.927 --> 00:27:38.027
for the first time in Korea.

00:27:38.797 --> 00:27:42.037
He'd eat Prosecutor Kim for lunch.

00:27:42.597 --> 00:27:44.637
Wait, why would Park Han Jun
even take this case?

00:27:45.767 --> 00:27:47.637
What, is he that desperate for money?

00:27:49.107 --> 00:27:50.537
That's not the point.

00:27:51.447 --> 00:27:53.577
Director Oh, this is a serial murder case.

00:27:53.847 --> 00:27:56.017
If we can't get the death penalty,
whoever prosecutes will be crucified.

00:27:56.017 --> 00:27:57.617
No one is going to want to touch it.

00:27:58.617 --> 00:28:02.017
Don't just play hot potato with the case
until it blows up in our faces.

00:28:02.657 --> 00:28:03.657
Let me take the case.

00:28:04.287 --> 00:28:07.327
Listen, you can't take on a case like this
out of some misguided sense of justice.

00:28:07.397 --> 00:28:09.797
Are my peer reviews going to be
any different next year?

00:28:10.527 --> 00:28:13.997
Not unless I solve a major case myself...
There's no other way, is there?

00:28:14.467 --> 00:28:16.037
But what if our department...

00:28:16.737 --> 00:28:19.167
had the prosecutor who finally took down
Park Han Jun?

00:28:19.767 --> 00:28:21.907
Then you, the director who mentored me.

00:28:22.507 --> 00:28:25.247
Wouldn't you be setting off fireworks
instead of a bomb?

00:28:26.607 --> 00:28:27.847
Please, assign me the case.

00:28:39.027 --> 00:28:40.027
(1 Ha 3, 1941)

00:28:51.407 --> 00:28:54.537
This is Attorney Park Han Jun.

00:28:55.107 --> 00:28:57.137
And this is Mr. Lee Woo Gyeom.

00:28:58.147 --> 00:28:59.147
A pleasure.

00:29:01.377 --> 00:29:04.987
To give you a brief summary of the case...

00:29:05.047 --> 00:29:06.187
You killed Moon Se Guk?

00:29:08.687 --> 00:29:10.927
Aren't you supposed to be
the composed one here?

00:29:11.387 --> 00:29:12.927
You're very impatient.

00:29:13.187 --> 00:29:16.097
Comes with the territory.
You hesitate, you get stabbed in the back.

00:29:18.927 --> 00:29:19.927
Lee Woo Gyeom.

00:29:20.627 --> 00:29:21.767
Did you really...

00:29:23.967 --> 00:29:25.237
kill Moon Se Guk?

00:29:28.507 --> 00:29:30.337
Yes, I did. Why?

00:29:35.377 --> 00:29:36.377
Then...

00:29:37.017 --> 00:29:38.017
The cure.

00:29:38.747 --> 00:29:40.487
The cure that Moon Se Guk had...

00:29:41.587 --> 00:29:43.717
- What did you do with it?
- What are you talking about?

00:29:44.887 --> 00:29:46.387
All I did was kill him.

00:29:46.687 --> 00:29:47.697
What?

00:29:51.997 --> 00:29:54.067
But the fact that
you're looking for a cure...

00:29:54.967 --> 00:29:56.267
It must mean someone you know is very ill.

00:29:56.337 --> 00:29:59.167
- Don't play games with me...
- Is it a family member?

00:30:00.167 --> 00:30:01.777
Seeing how desperate you are...

00:30:02.077 --> 00:30:04.037
Could it be the daughter
you had so late in life?

00:30:07.617 --> 00:30:09.817
You're more naive than I thought.

00:30:10.217 --> 00:30:11.817
No wonder you got scammed
out of 2 million dollars.

00:30:15.417 --> 00:30:16.417
You...

00:30:17.387 --> 00:30:18.987
What was your relationship
with Moon Se Guk?

00:30:20.057 --> 00:30:24.797
Tell me exactly what you know. And...
Where is the cure that Moon Se Guk had?

00:30:25.327 --> 00:30:26.567
I'm telling you, there's no such thing.

00:30:26.967 --> 00:30:28.967
He said he completed the clinical trials.
He was clear.

00:30:29.937 --> 00:30:30.937
It has to exist.

00:30:35.337 --> 00:30:36.337
Attorney Park.

00:30:37.707 --> 00:30:39.807
There is no cure for Batten disease.

00:30:40.917 --> 00:30:43.747
Especially for someone like Min Seo,
who's already showing early symptoms.

00:30:44.817 --> 00:30:47.117
Death within a few years
is the only possible outcome.

00:30:49.957 --> 00:30:50.957
Mr. Park.

00:30:51.687 --> 00:30:53.327
Why don't we all sit down?

00:31:07.407 --> 00:31:08.407
Attorney Park.

00:31:09.637 --> 00:31:10.977
There's no need to get so worked up.

00:31:11.777 --> 00:31:13.177
Let's have a real conversation.

00:31:13.847 --> 00:31:15.647
Moon Se Guk may have lied to you,

00:31:16.317 --> 00:31:17.317
but I, for one,

00:31:18.147 --> 00:31:19.587
can cure Min Seo's disease.

00:31:21.157 --> 00:31:22.157
But...

00:31:24.257 --> 00:31:25.327
How do you...

00:31:26.327 --> 00:31:28.157
even know my daughter's name?

00:31:32.267 --> 00:31:34.237
Since you came all this way today,

00:31:34.567 --> 00:31:35.997
I'll give you a retainer
of one million dollars.

00:31:37.267 --> 00:31:39.107
And if you get me out of here,

00:31:39.507 --> 00:31:41.537
- I'll give you another million dollars.
- Lee Woo Gyeom.

00:31:42.737 --> 00:31:44.747
Didn't I tell you to stop playing games?

00:31:46.147 --> 00:31:48.377
You're a lawyer.
Is being scammed all you've ever known?

00:31:49.247 --> 00:31:52.947
I have the money, if not the cure.
You don't believe me?

00:31:53.887 --> 00:31:54.887
Reporter Jo.

00:31:57.517 --> 00:31:58.857
He's for real, Attorney Park.

00:32:02.697 --> 00:32:04.567
No need to be so grateful.

00:32:05.727 --> 00:32:07.897
It's the money
you got scammed out of anyway.

00:32:13.837 --> 00:32:15.437
Let's just say I believe you.

00:32:16.137 --> 00:32:17.437
But what if I just take the money...

00:32:18.707 --> 00:32:20.077
and refuse to represent you?

00:32:25.147 --> 00:32:26.287
I doubt that's going to happen.

00:32:27.657 --> 00:32:30.087
Once you meet the people I've cured,

00:32:31.787 --> 00:32:33.957
you'll be the one coming to me.

00:32:36.097 --> 00:32:37.097
Lee Woo Gyeom.

00:32:39.067 --> 00:32:42.437
What makes you so confident?

00:32:42.867 --> 00:32:46.067
They all had incurable diseases,

00:32:46.807 --> 00:32:48.077
and I'm the one who cured them.

00:33:03.987 --> 00:33:05.857
(Taesan Bank deposit: 1 million dollars,
From Lee Woo Gyeom)

00:33:13.197 --> 00:33:16.297
A million dollars in one go. I'm jealous.

00:33:17.437 --> 00:33:20.207
I should've studied harder in school.

00:33:22.377 --> 00:33:23.377
Reporter Jo.

00:33:25.307 --> 00:33:26.847
What's the deal between
you and Lee Woo Gyeom?

00:33:28.117 --> 00:33:29.247
I already told you.

00:33:29.517 --> 00:33:31.987
I make the introduction,
and I get a commission.

00:33:32.947 --> 00:33:35.117
I think it was about a week
before he was arrested.

00:33:35.457 --> 00:33:37.317
Lee Woo Gyeom contacted me directly.

00:33:37.657 --> 00:33:38.887
A week before he was arrested?

00:33:39.387 --> 00:33:41.757
I thought he was crazy at first,
of course.

00:33:42.397 --> 00:33:46.327
But he claimed he was curing people
of incurable diseases...

00:33:46.527 --> 00:33:48.037
and told me to go find his patients.

00:33:48.437 --> 00:33:51.707
And there was survivor,
right there in front of me.

00:33:51.937 --> 00:33:54.307
And then, the money hit my account.

00:33:55.437 --> 00:33:58.007
I figured, "This is meant to be,"
and I just went with it.

00:33:59.577 --> 00:34:03.077
- You saw this for yourself, Reporter Jo?
- Yes. I'm the one who found them.

00:34:03.517 --> 00:34:05.087
That's why I ended up writing the article.

00:34:07.417 --> 00:34:08.417
Is that right?

00:34:10.117 --> 00:34:12.427
All right.
First, let's go meet this survivor.

00:34:13.357 --> 00:34:15.797
(Guam Police Station)

00:34:15.997 --> 00:34:20.167
It looks like most of the evidence
from the scene will be admissible.

00:34:20.427 --> 00:34:22.697
The forensics lab called this morning.

00:34:23.237 --> 00:34:27.267
They found a common substance
in all the victims' bodies.

00:34:28.037 --> 00:34:32.347
Apparently, it's very similar
to a compound...

00:34:32.407 --> 00:34:33.777
from a new drug just developed in the US.

00:34:34.207 --> 00:34:38.587
It's just strange that Lee Woo Gyeom
seems to have used it first.

00:34:38.747 --> 00:34:43.257
The guy must've been brilliant.
He was top of his class in med school.

00:34:43.887 --> 00:34:46.527
But then, the car accident happened,
and it was all over just like that.

00:34:47.327 --> 00:34:49.757
He was in a vegetative state for 3 years,
you said?

00:34:50.057 --> 00:34:52.297
That's right.
He only had two family members,

00:34:52.767 --> 00:34:54.597
and his mother passed away
while he was in that state.

00:34:54.667 --> 00:34:58.037
So he was left with no next of kin.

00:34:58.737 --> 00:35:02.937
And this...
This is the victims' profiles.

00:35:03.437 --> 00:35:05.147
I think you should take a look at these.

00:35:05.507 --> 00:35:08.517
(Summary of victims' criminal records)

00:35:09.947 --> 00:35:11.547
They all have criminal records?

00:35:11.917 --> 00:35:12.917
Yes.

00:35:15.887 --> 00:35:16.987
(Guam Medical Center)

00:35:17.057 --> 00:35:21.127
In that case...
What kind of treatment was it?

00:35:21.727 --> 00:35:23.157
Did he explain that to you?

00:35:23.227 --> 00:35:27.797
He did, but what would I know
about any of that?

00:35:28.067 --> 00:35:31.467
Then what made you decide
to go through with it?

00:35:33.337 --> 00:35:37.637
My husband was in so much pain.
I just told him to do whatever he wanted.

00:35:38.407 --> 00:35:41.947
Excuse me, do you know anyone else
who got the treatment before your husband?

00:35:42.017 --> 00:35:46.717
Yes. I was referred by Sang Woo's Mom.
We used to work together.

00:35:47.287 --> 00:35:51.527
She said her son was cured
of incurable polio.

00:35:52.087 --> 00:35:53.087
In that case,

00:35:54.327 --> 00:35:56.227
could I get her contact information?

00:35:56.527 --> 00:36:01.537
There's the owner of the hair salon
right next door to where I used to work.

00:36:01.797 --> 00:36:04.907
She and Sang Woo's mom have been friends
for a long time.

00:36:06.067 --> 00:36:08.837
You can probably find out from her
if you go there.

00:36:08.907 --> 00:36:10.007
(Lee Woo Gyeom: Murderer or Savior?)

00:36:10.407 --> 00:36:13.247
Have you met any other survivors
besides him?

00:36:13.447 --> 00:36:17.217
Besides Lee Chang Se who I just met,
it's all just been hearsay.

00:36:17.677 --> 00:36:19.017
What? So you wrote this article...

00:36:19.517 --> 00:36:20.687
without even meeting them?

00:36:21.357 --> 00:36:23.517
A guy's got to eat.

00:36:23.757 --> 00:36:26.427
An article's merit is measured in clicks,
isn't it?

00:36:27.787 --> 00:36:28.797
There was a time...

00:36:29.457 --> 00:36:32.367
when you were all about social justice
and fighting the Prosecution.

00:36:32.427 --> 00:36:34.667
Now it looks like all you're fighting
is your own conscience.

00:36:36.097 --> 00:36:39.707
Gosh, that's a great line.
You should comment that on the article.

00:36:39.767 --> 00:36:41.137
I bet it would go viral.

00:36:42.537 --> 00:36:44.977
- Goodness.
- Sure. I'll comment that it's all lies.

00:36:45.047 --> 00:36:49.217
Come on. The other one sounded better.
You should post that one, word for word.

00:36:50.647 --> 00:36:53.317
Cut the crap and tell me already.

00:36:53.987 --> 00:36:55.987
Besides the victims
whose dismembered bodies turned up,

00:36:56.417 --> 00:36:57.417
the other ten...

00:36:58.487 --> 00:37:01.457
- Where did you dump their bodies?
- If you look at it from another angle,

00:37:01.997 --> 00:37:03.527
that's not what's important
here at all.

00:37:05.967 --> 00:37:08.437
You killed 17 people.

00:37:08.967 --> 00:37:11.737
You should see it as me saving them,
not killing them.

00:37:14.737 --> 00:37:17.277
Is that really what's important to you?

00:37:17.907 --> 00:37:21.617
Not the fact that all your victims
had criminal records?

00:37:25.417 --> 00:37:26.947
You figured that out sooner
than I expected.

00:37:27.717 --> 00:37:31.187
So at trial, you were planning on saying,
"I only killed bad guys."

00:37:31.327 --> 00:37:33.227
"Please let me off the hook?" Is that it?

00:37:33.427 --> 00:37:36.557
Please. That's so childish.
I have some self-respect.

00:37:36.957 --> 00:37:40.067
Stop posturing. This is vigilantism.

00:37:40.467 --> 00:37:41.967
You really think that's going to hold up
in court?

00:37:46.337 --> 00:37:50.337
Prosecutor Cha.
I saved patients with incurable diseases.

00:37:51.137 --> 00:37:53.947
Their deaths were a necessary sacrifice
to save others.

00:37:53.947 --> 00:37:55.347
So when exactly were you going to ask me
about that?

00:37:56.017 --> 00:37:58.347
Even if you saved 100 or 1,000 people,

00:37:58.687 --> 00:38:01.047
killing someone means you're a murderer,
doesn't it?

00:38:04.727 --> 00:38:08.427
Isn't that simpler math than 17 minus 17?

00:38:10.227 --> 00:38:11.497
Are we done here?

00:38:11.827 --> 00:38:12.827
Sit down.

00:38:14.027 --> 00:38:16.297
You don't get up before I do.

00:38:16.897 --> 00:38:19.867
If you wanted to be treated like a human,
you should've acted like one.

00:38:21.377 --> 00:38:23.737
Don't get cocky,
you murdering son of a gun.

00:38:24.077 --> 00:38:25.077
I apologize.

00:38:27.507 --> 00:38:28.517
Such a self-righteous ass.

00:38:29.377 --> 00:38:32.087
- What was that?
- Nothing.

00:38:34.347 --> 00:38:35.357
Forget it.

00:38:35.687 --> 00:38:37.557
You don't have to tell me
where you dumped them.

00:38:37.987 --> 00:38:41.957
I've already identified all the victims,
and I have more than enough to indict you.

00:38:42.657 --> 00:38:45.027
I couldn't care less
about your so-called "cure."

00:38:46.267 --> 00:38:48.667
You can go ahead
and run your mouth in court.

00:38:54.067 --> 00:38:56.137
You're just taking your bad mood out on me
because it's hot.

00:39:00.477 --> 00:39:02.417
If you insist on being this stubborn,

00:39:03.517 --> 00:39:04.947
you're the one walking away with nothing.

00:39:22.467 --> 00:39:24.667
We have to find those dump sites,
no matter what.

00:39:25.337 --> 00:39:27.937
What? You're saying
Lee Woo Gyeom won't cooperate?

00:39:28.277 --> 00:39:30.477
He's just trying to play games with us.

00:39:31.707 --> 00:39:33.747
If we just let him
spoon-feed us the answers,

00:39:34.047 --> 00:39:35.377
it'll be humiliating.

00:39:35.847 --> 00:39:37.147
But Prosecutor Cha,

00:39:37.347 --> 00:39:39.117
if you could persuade him,
we could find the victims much sooner...

00:39:39.187 --> 00:39:41.087
Persuade him?
I ought to be chewing him out.

00:39:41.557 --> 00:39:44.187
We'll find them on our own,
and then we'll indict him.

00:39:44.557 --> 00:39:46.827
- Got it?
- Yes, ma'am. Understood.

00:39:47.187 --> 00:39:49.327
I'll expand the search parameters
and get started.

00:39:52.067 --> 00:39:53.367
I think we've checked everything here.

00:39:53.427 --> 00:39:55.597
- Let's move on to the next alley.
- You guys check that way.

00:39:55.667 --> 00:39:56.767
We'll go this way.

00:39:58.267 --> 00:40:00.207
Excuse me, ma'am.
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

00:40:00.807 --> 00:40:02.607
We're from the Guam Police Station.

00:40:02.707 --> 00:40:03.907
- Do you have CCTV?
- Are any cameras installed?

00:40:04.237 --> 00:40:05.307
At our shop...

00:40:05.677 --> 00:40:07.007
By any chance,
could we check your CCTV footage?

00:40:07.277 --> 00:40:08.317
- May we see your CCTV footage?
- One moment.

00:40:08.377 --> 00:40:09.377
Just a moment.

Why are you looking for Sang Woo's Mom?

00:40:21.557 --> 00:40:25.767
I heard that
Sang Woo made a full recovery.

00:40:25.867 --> 00:40:27.467
- Really?
- Yes.

00:40:27.927 --> 00:40:29.237
No way, how did that happen?

00:40:29.597 --> 00:40:30.897
So, that's why...

00:40:31.537 --> 00:40:32.807
Her home address...

00:40:33.437 --> 00:40:35.507
or her new phone number...
Do you happen to have it?

00:40:36.107 --> 00:40:39.177
She only told me she'd contact me
once she got settled.

00:40:39.247 --> 00:40:41.247
She didn't give me any other details.

00:40:41.377 --> 00:40:44.477
Sang Woo's Mom had it really tough
when she was here.

00:40:44.787 --> 00:40:48.517
The money she made for his medical fees.
It was nowhere near enough.

00:40:49.357 --> 00:40:51.887
And she couldn't look after Sang Woo
while she was at work, you know.

00:40:52.487 --> 00:40:56.527
Look, what about places Sang Woo's Mom
or Sang Woo used to frequent?

00:40:56.697 --> 00:40:59.567
Or someone who was like family to them,
like you?

00:40:59.627 --> 00:41:01.897
Seriously, anything at all.
Please just tell us.

00:41:02.037 --> 00:41:04.437
I don't know if this will help. Hold on.

00:41:04.437 --> 00:41:07.707
Sang Woo really loved to draw, you know.

00:41:08.707 --> 00:41:10.737
Here it is, right here.
Take a look at this.

00:41:10.937 --> 00:41:12.007
He was so talented, wasn't he?

00:41:21.147 --> 00:41:22.487
- Over there.
- That way.

00:41:26.087 --> 00:41:27.357
Haven't seen them.

00:41:28.497 --> 00:41:29.497
Do you...

00:41:38.637 --> 00:41:39.807
No, I haven't seen them.

and a former medical student.

00:41:48.277 --> 00:41:50.617
We're here at the scene where police
are searching for more of his victims.

00:41:50.947 --> 00:41:54.787
Public outcry is growing
over the massive police mobilization.

00:41:55.417 --> 00:41:58.227
They say it's a waste of manpower,
all based on the suspect's single word.

00:41:58.287 --> 00:41:59.987
- Reporter Jo.
- Yes?

00:41:59.987 --> 00:42:01.127
The victims.

00:42:02.197 --> 00:42:03.427
Do you have any of them identified?

00:42:04.297 --> 00:42:05.927
The police aren't releasing any names yet.

00:42:07.367 --> 00:42:08.697
In that case, I need you to...

00:42:09.667 --> 00:42:12.007
do some digging on your own.

00:42:12.837 --> 00:42:13.937
Okay, I'll do that.

00:42:21.917 --> 00:42:23.217
You've had a long day, Prosecutor Cha.

00:42:23.647 --> 00:42:27.317

Mr. Lee Woo Gyeom.
Is it true that you murdered people?

00:42:40.127 --> 00:42:41.127
Yes.

00:42:41.367 --> 00:42:44.237
Is it false that you treated people
and saved their lives?

No.

Are you sure
this test was administered correctly?

00:42:55.777 --> 00:42:59.587
Yes. They said his responses were normal.
They even ran a different test pattern,

00:42:59.847 --> 00:43:03.217
and the results were still the same.
And the funny thing is,

00:43:03.417 --> 00:43:05.227
they said he was happy that he passed.

00:43:10.997 --> 00:43:12.597
Why are you still just searching?

00:43:13.127 --> 00:43:15.867
Lee Woo Gyeom is using the location
of the bodies as a bargaining chip.

00:43:16.097 --> 00:43:17.437
Just play along and wrap this up.

00:43:17.667 --> 00:43:19.867

by the nose for the entire trial.

because we can't find the victims.

00:43:22.377 --> 00:43:23.477
I understand.

00:43:24.077 --> 00:43:25.207
I'll think it over.

00:43:33.587 --> 00:43:35.017
This isn't a confession.

00:43:35.787 --> 00:43:37.357
You've written your own heroic epic.

00:43:38.927 --> 00:43:40.957

whether you believe me or not...

That's what changes the genre.

Whatever the genre, the ending
to this story is the death penalty.

00:43:59.177 --> 00:44:00.177
Fine.

00:44:01.347 --> 00:44:04.777
- Since we're on the subject, tell me.
- Tell me what?

00:44:04.777 --> 00:44:06.487
You said you treated people.

00:44:07.117 --> 00:44:08.187
So tell me all about it.

00:44:11.687 --> 00:44:12.857
Are you serious?

00:44:13.257 --> 00:44:14.757
Want to start with the cure?

00:44:15.627 --> 00:44:16.627
Actually, no.

00:44:17.257 --> 00:44:19.227
Start with how you made it.

00:44:23.137 --> 00:44:24.237
Are you going to tell me or not?

00:44:30.407 --> 00:44:34.347
The cure...
It all began with a dying potted plant.

00:44:36.717 --> 00:44:39.647
I poured some leftover liquid
from my research into the pot,

00:44:43.487 --> 00:44:45.457
and when I checked on it the next day,

00:44:46.657 --> 00:44:48.527
the dead flower had come back to life.

00:44:49.897 --> 00:44:51.697
That's the cure?

00:44:52.197 --> 00:44:53.197
Yes.

00:44:54.167 --> 00:44:55.197
Go on.

00:44:56.667 --> 00:44:58.667
Next, I took that cure,

00:44:59.567 --> 00:45:01.037
and put it in a fish tank.

00:45:02.237 --> 00:45:04.437
My dead goldfish came back to life.

00:45:05.677 --> 00:45:09.947
Then there was a cat with an injured leg.
It recovered so well that...

00:45:11.277 --> 00:45:12.417
it was jumping high again in no time.

00:45:18.257 --> 00:45:20.957
At this point, aren't you curious too?

00:45:22.457 --> 00:45:23.997
If it works on humans.

00:45:28.197 --> 00:45:30.197
That's when you started killing people?

00:45:30.967 --> 00:45:32.867
I told you, it wasn't murder.
It was research.

00:45:35.007 --> 00:45:38.977
- How long did you plan to keep this up?
- But the thing is...

00:45:40.007 --> 00:45:41.917
Humans are definitely a lot harder.

00:45:42.617 --> 00:45:44.217
How long...

00:45:45.747 --> 00:45:47.387
did you plan on going around
killing people?

00:45:51.957 --> 00:45:53.027
Seventeen people.

00:45:53.727 --> 00:45:54.857
That was it.

00:45:56.497 --> 00:45:57.497
Why?

00:45:58.357 --> 00:45:59.767
Because the experiment was a success.

00:46:02.137 --> 00:46:04.137
Who was the last victim?

00:46:05.837 --> 00:46:07.007
Hong Jae Gwang.

00:46:07.737 --> 00:46:08.937
Are you sure about that?

00:46:10.007 --> 00:46:11.007
Yes.

00:46:35.437 --> 00:46:36.497
Okay.

00:46:37.597 --> 00:46:39.707
Why didn't you resist arrest?

00:46:40.807 --> 00:46:42.177
You could've gotten away.

00:46:42.907 --> 00:46:45.037
I was planning to turn myself in
after treating my patient,

00:46:45.877 --> 00:46:47.077
Lee Chang Se, anyway.

00:46:49.417 --> 00:46:50.417
Turn yourself in?

00:46:51.517 --> 00:46:54.817
I was just waiting for the right moment
to prove my abilities.

00:46:55.617 --> 00:46:57.457
You didn't catch me.

00:46:58.587 --> 00:47:01.797
Why do you insist on proving it,

00:47:02.127 --> 00:47:04.327
specifically through a trial?

00:47:04.657 --> 00:47:07.897
Because that's the most official,
indisputable way.

00:47:14.237 --> 00:47:16.137
That's how I can be forgiven for my sins.

00:47:19.177 --> 00:47:21.747
Not forgiveness. Condemnation.

00:47:23.777 --> 00:47:24.877
We'll see about that.

00:47:26.487 --> 00:47:27.487
Okay.

00:47:30.087 --> 00:47:31.087
All right.

00:47:31.887 --> 00:47:34.587

of your so-called cure.

it's your turn to help me out.

00:47:40.997 --> 00:47:43.397
Where did you dump the remaining victims?

00:47:49.207 --> 00:47:51.007

- Yes, sir.

00:48:07.327 --> 00:48:09.127
- Let's go.
- All right.

00:48:19.637 --> 00:48:22.077
I heard there's something called
a plea bargain in trials.

00:48:22.877 --> 00:48:27.147
- Yes.
- Well, I don't want a lighter sentence.

00:48:29.547 --> 00:48:31.117
I want to make a different kind of deal.

00:48:32.247 --> 00:48:33.617
First, I'll need you...

You'll see for yourself once you check.

00:52:06.497 --> 00:52:09.237
It's complicated to explain in words,
you see.

00:52:14.467 --> 00:52:16.277
Moon Se Guk lied,

00:52:18.437 --> 00:52:19.507
but as for me,

00:52:20.977 --> 00:52:22.647
I can cure Min Seo's illness.

00:52:23.447 --> 00:52:24.847
Every single one of them...

00:52:26.287 --> 00:52:27.817
was treated by me.

00:52:42.137 --> 00:52:43.967
Now it's your turn to cross the line,
Prosecutor Cha.

00:52:45.807 --> 00:52:47.137
Come over to my side.

00:52:48.037 --> 00:52:49.907
I will personally show you in court.

00:52:51.577 --> 00:52:52.677
How I can save a life...

00:52:54.877 --> 00:52:56.277
without so much as a scalpel.
