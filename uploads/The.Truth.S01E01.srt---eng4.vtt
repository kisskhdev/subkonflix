What's it? Spit it out.

00:04:47.536 --> 00:04:48.536
I need money urgently.

00:04:51.296 --> 00:04:51.896
Okay.

The victim's name was Guo Bingbing,

a 14-year-old student
at No. 2 Middle School.

00:08:26.617 --> 00:08:29.017

We've asked you to come in today

00:13:05.416 --> 00:13:08.056
to see if you can help us
piece together Guo Bingbing's last days.

00:13:09.776 --> 00:13:12.017
What time did Bingbing usually
come home after school?

00:13:14.857 --> 00:13:17.617
So she generally
didn't linger outside, right?

00:13:31.896 --> 00:13:36.760
(Interview Room)

00:14:30.816 --> 00:14:31.737
(Forensic Unit)
Both eyeballs have

00:14:31.737 --> 00:14:33.377
petechial hemorrhages
in the conjunctivae.

00:14:33.377 --> 00:14:34.977
Livor mortis is dark purplish-red.

00:14:34.977 --> 00:14:37.017
And there is friction damage

00:14:37.017 --> 00:14:40.337
between the victim's lips and teeth
due to an anoxic stress reaction.

00:14:40.337 --> 00:14:41.617
These findings

00:14:41.617 --> 00:14:43.737
are consistent with mechanical asphyxia.

00:14:43.776 --> 00:14:46.377
The victim's hymen shows fresh tearing,

00:14:46.497 --> 00:14:48.337
but there's no sign of bleeding.

00:14:48.497 --> 00:14:51.776
This indicates that
when the suspect committed rape,

00:14:51.776 --> 00:14:54.776
the victim's blood circulation
had stopped. She was already dead.

00:14:56.416 --> 00:14:57.257
Food's here.

00:14:58.497 --> 00:14:59.656

00:15:05.377 --> 00:15:05.816
Okay.

00:15:05.816 --> 00:15:07.617
Master, yours.

00:15:07.704 --> 00:15:08.576
Let's talk over food.

00:15:09.097 --> 00:15:10.176
Ziwu, continue.

00:15:10.737 --> 00:15:11.977
Let's look at this.

00:15:15.137 --> 00:15:16.737
The wound is 0.5 cm wide,

00:15:16.856 --> 00:15:19.064
with a horizontal, backward band-like
epidermal abrasion

00:15:19.416 --> 00:15:20.536
and subcutaneous hemorrhage.

00:15:20.816 --> 00:15:22.857
The left ligature furrow
is more severely damaged.

00:15:22.857 --> 00:15:26.576
There are parallel, comb-like
skin folds, left higher than right.

00:15:28.017 --> 00:15:31.536
Combining the folds
left on the victim's skin,

00:15:32.377 --> 00:15:33.176
the wound depth,

00:15:33.176 --> 00:15:35.017
and compression hemorrhages
at the neck's back,

00:15:35.257 --> 00:15:38.497
the suspect
likely used a specialized tool.

00:15:38.696 --> 00:15:41.137
Like some kind of snare.

00:15:41.656 --> 00:15:43.377
But why did No. 2 Middle School choose

00:15:43.377 --> 00:15:44.857
such a location for their new campus?

00:15:44.857 --> 00:15:46.576
It's way too remote.

00:15:47.296 --> 00:15:48.056
Teachers

00:15:48.696 --> 00:15:49.696
and students

00:15:50.017 --> 00:15:51.497
all use that road to commute.

00:15:51.776 --> 00:15:53.576
It gets pretty busy during rush hours.

00:15:54.056 --> 00:15:55.896
But it clears out after that.

00:15:56.816 --> 00:15:58.457
Graduating classes finish late,

00:15:58.457 --> 00:15:59.497
so parents are worried.

00:15:59.696 --> 00:16:01.056
Most pick their kids up.

00:16:01.257 --> 00:16:04.536
The others make sure their kids
go home together.

00:16:05.617 --> 00:16:06.497
I heard the victim

00:16:06.497 --> 00:16:09.337
used to ride a bike home
with classmates before.

00:16:09.696 --> 00:16:11.416

The DNA samples from semen stains
found at the scene

00:16:21.257 --> 00:16:22.857
matched two unsolved cases.

00:16:24.617 --> 00:16:27.977
The suspect is linked
to the Weigang Street assault case

00:16:28.337 --> 00:16:29.936
(Juvenile Victimization Case)
and the Tianpeng Street rape case.

00:16:30.217 --> 00:16:31.497
Plus the latest one.

00:16:31.497 --> 00:16:33.617
It's three crimes in under a month.

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:44.896
Can you do it?

00:16:44.896 --> 00:16:45.497
Slow down.

00:16:45.497 --> 00:16:45.977
Buzz off.

00:16:46.497 --> 00:16:47.176

Come on.

00:17:02.337 --> 00:17:03.696
You made a bit of progress.

All thanks to your teaching.

Got it. I'll rub them later.

00:17:38.217 --> 00:17:39.017
Hold on.

00:17:51.217 --> 00:17:52.017
Like what you see?

Look at you.

00:18:13.536 --> 00:18:14.737
Don't return to this square.

00:18:14.737 --> 00:18:16.737
Why bother dealing
with someone like that?

00:18:18.376 --> 00:18:20.257

Why aren't you here yet?

00:19:29.417 --> 00:19:31.856
I'll wait across from the school.

(Yunxi Police Department)

Chief Xu,

00:20:26.177 --> 00:20:28.056
I fear the suspect will strike again.

00:20:28.737 --> 00:20:31.497
Since we've confirmed
it's the same person,

00:20:31.697 --> 00:20:34.257
evidence and clues
from the first two cases

00:20:34.457 --> 00:20:36.536
should help us catch him.

00:20:37.657 --> 00:20:39.816
Three crimes in over 20 days
is too frequent.

00:20:40.217 --> 00:20:44.457
Families of the first two victims
are unhappy with us.

00:20:44.816 --> 00:20:47.816
They feel we didn't take their cases
seriously enough.

00:20:48.616 --> 00:20:50.017
Now that there's been a murder,

00:20:50.017 --> 00:20:51.417
we're going back to them.

00:20:53.576 --> 00:20:54.257
Zhang,

00:20:54.816 --> 00:20:56.056
we asked you here to help

00:20:56.056 --> 00:20:59.017
because our female field officers
are all on the task force,

00:20:59.017 --> 00:21:01.536
and our admin staff
isn't familiar with the situation.

Don't worry.

00:21:03.576 --> 00:21:05.657
Supporting field officers
is part of our job.

00:21:06.417 --> 00:21:10.856
The parents
might say some harsh things later.

00:21:11.457 --> 00:21:12.977
Be mentally prepared.

00:21:14.056 --> 00:21:14.816

Let's go.

00:21:18.217 --> 00:21:22.257
You cops can't solve the case,
and now you're wasting our time?

00:21:22.376 --> 00:21:24.417
Isn't this just wasting
taxpayers' money?

00:21:24.776 --> 00:21:25.856
Have you no shame?

00:21:26.217 --> 00:21:29.017
Is this how public servants
treat the people?

00:21:30.697 --> 00:21:32.816
Ma'am, please stay calm.

00:21:33.576 --> 00:21:36.376
We asked you here today

00:21:36.937 --> 00:21:39.856
to approach the case responsibly.

00:21:41.536 --> 00:21:43.136
We need evidence to solve crimes.

00:21:43.977 --> 00:21:45.017
But honestly,

00:21:45.177 --> 00:21:48.856
the scene in your daughter's case
was heavily compromised.

00:21:49.096 --> 00:21:50.816
Trace evidence was destroyed.

00:21:51.257 --> 00:21:53.937
If our tech hadn't been meticulous,

00:21:54.336 --> 00:21:57.856
finding that cigarette butt
200 meters from the crime scene,

00:21:58.457 --> 00:22:00.977
we'd have no leads
on that case even now.

00:22:01.217 --> 00:22:03.977
Isn't calling us here now
still pointless?

00:22:05.376 --> 00:22:06.657
Can I say something?

00:22:07.697 --> 00:22:09.616
I've been here forever.

00:22:10.217 --> 00:22:12.417
That day, I skipped evening study

00:22:12.616 --> 00:22:13.616
to meet my friend.

00:22:14.217 --> 00:22:16.096
I first waited for him
at the school gate.

00:22:16.336 --> 00:22:17.816
But he never showed up.

00:22:17.816 --> 00:22:19.257
So I went to wait across the street.

00:22:23.937 --> 00:22:25.296
Why haven't you come yet?

00:22:25.457 --> 00:22:26.897
Hurry up, or I'll be mad.

00:22:48.897 --> 00:22:49.616
Xiaomeng!

00:22:51.177 --> 00:22:51.977
Xiaomeng!

00:22:54.257 --> 00:22:56.177
It's dangerous. Don't go.

00:22:57.017 --> 00:22:58.657
Are you okay?

00:22:58.657 --> 00:22:59.376
Are you alright?

00:23:01.657 --> 00:23:03.417
I'm here.

00:23:05.336 --> 00:23:06.776
It's okay now. It's okay.

00:23:08.536 --> 00:23:11.096
Can you describe in detail
what was used to strangle you?

00:23:13.417 --> 00:23:16.017
It felt like metal, I think.

00:23:16.776 --> 00:23:18.136
It was definitely rough.

00:23:18.177 --> 00:23:19.697
I tried to scream,

00:23:19.897 --> 00:23:21.417
but he was choking me so tightly.

00:23:21.417 --> 00:23:22.336
I couldn't.

00:23:22.816 --> 00:23:24.536
Did you see the attacker's face?

00:23:26.296 --> 00:23:28.376
He was behind me the whole time,

00:23:28.977 --> 00:23:30.336
so I didn't see his face.

00:23:30.737 --> 00:23:32.897
I only saw his back when he ran away.

00:23:33.536 --> 00:23:35.937
He was about the same height
as my friend,

00:23:36.217 --> 00:23:38.776
around 1.75 meters tall, I guess.

00:23:39.417 --> 00:23:40.737
Average build.

00:23:40.937 --> 00:23:42.096
He ran pretty fast.

00:23:43.217 --> 00:23:44.776
As for what he was wearing,

00:23:45.096 --> 00:23:46.977
it was drab and dirty.

00:23:46.977 --> 00:23:48.497
Definitely cheap stuff.

00:23:50.217 --> 00:23:50.897
Right.

00:23:51.816 --> 00:23:57.536
That plastic bag. The black one he put
over my head, it stank really bad.

00:23:57.536 --> 00:23:59.856
It smelled like rotten fish and shrimp.

00:24:01.816 --> 00:24:02.816
A fishy smell?

00:24:04.856 --> 00:24:05.856
Are you sure?

00:24:06.136 --> 00:24:07.457
I'm allergic to seafood.

00:24:07.657 --> 00:24:09.616
That fishy smell made me gag instantly.

00:24:10.937 --> 00:24:12.697
Chen Xiaomeng mentioned the fishy smell.

00:24:13.217 --> 00:24:16.296
And we found multiple fish scales
in Guo Bingbing's hair.

00:24:16.536 --> 00:24:18.856
So I think it's the same suspect.

00:24:19.977 --> 00:24:21.056
What about Li Ying?

00:24:21.417 --> 00:24:22.497
Her parents declined.

00:24:22.737 --> 00:24:24.336
They didn't want to make her suffer.

00:24:27.056 --> 00:24:27.856
I'll go.

00:24:29.257 --> 00:24:30.257
I'll go with you.

00:24:31.257 --> 00:24:33.296
We've already said everything
there is to say.

00:24:33.376 --> 00:24:35.136
What else do you want from us?

00:24:36.177 --> 00:24:38.776
Can't catch the criminal,
so you just keep harassing us?

00:24:39.336 --> 00:24:41.616
Can't you see
how much this hurts our daughter?

00:24:41.737 --> 00:24:44.056
We're here just to gather more clues.

00:24:44.056 --> 00:24:44.576
It'll help...

00:24:44.576 --> 00:24:46.177
We've already moved.

00:24:46.457 --> 00:24:47.536
And you've found us again.

00:24:47.657 --> 00:24:49.296
If the neighbors find out,

00:24:49.296 --> 00:24:50.497
how can we hold our heads up?

00:24:50.937 --> 00:24:52.296
Have you ever considered us?

00:24:56.737 --> 00:24:57.697
Just say less, will you?

00:24:57.697 --> 00:24:58.737
Ying is at home.

00:24:58.737 --> 00:24:59.457
What?

00:24:59.497 --> 00:25:00.616
Am I wrong?

00:25:00.816 --> 00:25:02.737
Ying attended a top city school.

00:25:02.737 --> 00:25:04.017
The school was hard to enter.

00:25:05.897 --> 00:25:07.616
Ever since that thing happened,

00:25:07.816 --> 00:25:09.897
you kept coming around constantly.

00:25:10.336 --> 00:25:12.217
We couldn't take it anymore

00:25:12.336 --> 00:25:14.657
and had to transfer her
to this district school.

00:25:15.136 --> 00:25:17.017
And now you've tracked us down here too.

00:25:17.296 --> 00:25:18.457
Will this ever end?

00:25:19.017 --> 00:25:20.257
Will it ever end?

00:25:21.497 --> 00:25:25.657
Ying used to be in the top three
in her whole school.

00:25:25.977 --> 00:25:27.697
Now she's fallen to beyond 20th place.

00:25:27.697 --> 00:25:30.017
If she can't get into a key high school,

00:25:30.017 --> 00:25:31.136
can you take responsibility?

00:25:32.376 --> 00:25:33.336
I understand

00:25:33.336 --> 00:25:34.737
how hard it's been for you...

00:25:34.737 --> 00:25:35.657
Enough.

00:25:36.096 --> 00:25:36.937
Stop talking.

00:25:36.937 --> 00:25:38.536
I know you have no answers for us now.

00:25:38.536 --> 00:25:39.136
Mom.

00:25:41.536 --> 00:25:43.056
Let me talk to the police.

00:25:50.697 --> 00:25:52.177
Ying, if you don't want to talk,

00:25:52.177 --> 00:25:53.376
you can go back to your room.

00:25:54.336 --> 00:25:55.816
I'm here. You have nothing to fear.

00:25:56.457 --> 00:25:57.856
Let's go inside for a while.

00:25:57.856 --> 00:25:59.017
What are you doing?

00:25:59.136 --> 00:25:59.897
Leave it to me.

00:25:59.897 --> 00:26:01.017
You? What can you do?

00:26:01.017 --> 00:26:03.017
If you hadn't been too lazy those days

00:26:03.017 --> 00:26:04.248
to fix the car,

00:26:04.248 --> 00:26:05.784
- it wouldn't have occurred.
- Just calm down.

00:26:05.784 --> 00:26:06.424
Leave it to me.

00:26:06.424 --> 00:26:07.776
Now the police are back...

00:26:09.096 --> 00:26:10.096
Sorry about that.

00:26:10.536 --> 00:26:12.296
She's just like that.

00:26:13.296 --> 00:26:14.977
Well, you talk first.

00:26:14.977 --> 00:26:16.296
I'll go cut some fruit for you.

00:26:22.856 --> 00:26:25.056
Li Ying, don't be nervous.

00:26:25.776 --> 00:26:27.816
We're just here to talk with you today

00:26:28.336 --> 00:26:31.376
and see if there were any clues
we might have missed the first time.

00:26:32.576 --> 00:26:34.177
The more clues we have,

00:26:34.376 --> 00:26:36.296
the faster we can catch the suspect.

00:26:39.096 --> 00:26:40.776
Now, please try to recall.

00:26:41.096 --> 00:26:42.376
On the day of the incident,

00:26:42.816 --> 00:26:46.897
did anything
particularly unusual happen?

00:26:49.776 --> 00:26:52.336
I've already told you everything I know.

00:26:55.657 --> 00:26:58.336
Like certain sounds,

00:26:58.937 --> 00:26:59.776
smells,

00:27:00.417 --> 00:27:01.376
or the environment.

00:27:02.457 --> 00:27:03.816
Anything felt unusual to you.

00:27:04.937 --> 00:27:06.217
You can tell us about it.

00:27:11.737 --> 00:27:13.217
Just say whatever comes to mind.

00:27:13.217 --> 00:27:13.977
It's fine.

00:27:21.296 --> 00:27:23.457
That night after evening self-study,

00:27:23.816 --> 00:27:25.296
my dad's car broke down.

00:27:25.737 --> 00:27:27.376
He told me to take a taxi home.

00:27:28.737 --> 00:27:30.657
Let's hang out again sometime.

00:27:30.657 --> 00:27:31.177
Sure.

00:27:31.177 --> 00:27:31.776
Bye-bye.

00:27:33.816 --> 00:27:34.776
We're off too.

00:27:34.904 --> 00:27:35.417
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

00:27:35.417 --> 00:27:35.897
Bye-bye.

00:28:48.096 --> 00:28:51.017
I told you that bag stank.

00:28:51.616 --> 00:28:53.417
It had a sour, rotten smell.

00:28:53.697 --> 00:28:56.136
Just thinking about that smell
makes me feel sick.

00:28:57.417 --> 00:28:58.136
Li Ying.

00:28:58.616 --> 00:28:59.296
Li Ying.

00:28:59.856 --> 00:29:00.576
What's wrong?

00:29:03.336 --> 00:29:04.336
Ying, are you okay?

00:29:06.576 --> 00:29:08.217
The bag with a sour smell.

00:29:23.417 --> 00:29:24.136
Wait.

00:29:40.056 --> 00:29:41.897
You must catch him.

00:30:23.992 --> 00:30:28.984
(Dan Qing, Core Member
of Huo's Drug Trafficking Ring)

00:31:21.576 --> 00:31:24.576
Officers handling the rape
and sexual assault cases

00:31:24.576 --> 00:31:26.616
secured surveillance footage
immediately.

00:31:26.816 --> 00:31:28.376
But the lighting was too dim.

00:31:28.497 --> 00:31:30.136
We didn't find anything useful.

00:31:31.217 --> 00:31:34.616
Huaibei Road is a newly opened road
in the district.

00:31:34.856 --> 00:31:36.536
It has no surveillance cameras yet.

00:31:37.616 --> 00:31:41.056
So I've expanded the search radius
to five kilometers.

00:31:41.536 --> 00:31:44.576
It's still ongoing
and doesn't look good.

00:31:45.576 --> 00:31:48.336
Multiple three-dimensional shoe prints
were lifted from the scene.

00:31:48.336 --> 00:31:49.897
Based on the full length of the prints,

00:31:49.897 --> 00:31:52.136
the suspect is estimated
to be around 1.75 meters tall,

00:31:52.136 --> 00:31:53.336
with a medium build.

00:31:53.497 --> 00:31:55.217
The stride pattern
shows a straight line,

00:31:55.217 --> 00:31:56.737
excluding him being drunk at the crime

00:31:56.737 --> 00:31:58.497
or having any physical disability.

00:31:59.017 --> 00:32:00.136
He was fully aware.

00:32:00.536 --> 00:32:02.056
The statements

00:32:02.056 --> 00:32:05.177
of the victims in both cases
are quite consistent.

00:32:05.177 --> 00:32:07.977
No other fingerprints were found
on Guo Bingbing's bicycle.

00:32:11.616 --> 00:32:15.737
Both the rape and assault victims
mentioned a fishy-smelling plastic bag.

00:32:16.257 --> 00:32:17.977
When we collected samples at the scene,

00:32:17.977 --> 00:32:20.536
we also found several fish scales
in Guo Bingbing's hair.

00:32:21.017 --> 00:32:22.576
These are the fish scales we collected.

00:32:22.776 --> 00:32:23.977
They're from carp.

00:32:24.616 --> 00:32:26.457
Considering the suspect's pattern,

00:32:26.737 --> 00:32:27.576
I suspect

00:32:27.616 --> 00:32:29.977
these scales likely fell out
of the plastic bag.

00:32:30.737 --> 00:32:32.056
But strangely,

00:32:32.217 --> 00:32:34.017
all the fish involved
are single-scaled fish.

00:32:34.296 --> 00:32:36.136
Now, for farmed carp,

00:32:36.536 --> 00:32:39.616
they're usually at least two-scaled
before being sold.

00:32:40.336 --> 00:32:43.096
Single-scaled ones
aren't typically sold in markets.

00:32:43.897 --> 00:32:45.776
But if it was caught wild

00:32:46.017 --> 00:32:47.497
or is a wild carp,

00:32:48.096 --> 00:32:49.296
then logically,

00:32:49.296 --> 00:32:51.856
we shouldn't have found
only single-scaled fish's scales.

00:32:52.376 --> 00:32:54.296
There should also be two-scaled,

00:32:54.296 --> 00:32:55.937
three-scaled, and even four-scaled ones.

00:32:58.336 --> 00:33:01.897
So I think the black plastic bags
the killer used

00:33:02.096 --> 00:33:05.776
were for transporting brood fish
to stock a new fishpond.

00:33:06.296 --> 00:33:08.737
For a new fishpond

00:33:08.856 --> 00:33:11.856
or one just stocked with fry,

00:33:12.177 --> 00:33:15.296
outsiders usually can't fish.

00:33:15.937 --> 00:33:16.856
Therefore,

00:33:18.497 --> 00:33:22.616
it's highly likely
the suspect owns his own fishpond.

00:33:23.336 --> 00:33:24.697
We also found some dust particles

00:33:24.697 --> 00:33:26.816
on Guo Bingbing's clothes.

00:33:26.897 --> 00:33:27.776
Tests revealed

00:33:27.776 --> 00:33:28.897
they're incense ash.

00:33:29.457 --> 00:33:30.977
And it's the really cheap kind,

00:33:30.977 --> 00:33:34.536
made from basic wood shavings
and chemical fragrances.

00:33:34.536 --> 00:33:36.096
Rumor has it incense ash kills sperm.

00:33:36.096 --> 00:33:38.616
Also, the cigarette butts collected
near the scenes

00:33:38.816 --> 00:33:40.017
yielded DNA.

00:33:42.336 --> 00:33:42.977
Ye Qian.

00:33:46.056 --> 00:33:47.417
For the rape and assault cases,

00:33:47.697 --> 00:33:50.457
the butts were from cheap cigarettes,
seven yuan a pack.

00:33:50.937 --> 00:33:53.776
But the third case is different
from the previous ones.

00:33:54.056 --> 00:33:55.417
It's a premium brand,

00:33:55.737 --> 00:33:57.536
costing about 70 to 80 yuan a pack.

00:33:59.257 --> 00:34:01.136
Even though I quit smoking years ago,

00:34:01.136 --> 00:34:03.657
I still understand a smoker's mindset.

00:34:04.376 --> 00:34:06.657
Habits of luxury are hard to unlearn.

00:34:06.937 --> 00:34:08.977
The suspect
is definitely a chain smoker.

00:34:09.337 --> 00:34:12.017
People like that
easily crave a cigarette when stressed.

00:34:12.017 --> 00:34:12.937
That also explains

00:34:12.937 --> 00:34:15.817
why he left cigarette butts
on the periphery after the crime.

00:34:15.817 --> 00:34:18.656
Therefore, the cigarette butt evidence
needs thorough analysis.

00:34:23.777 --> 00:34:24.377
Long.

00:34:25.136 --> 00:34:29.977
You've lived with Ye Qian
for about half a year now, right?

00:34:30.656 --> 00:34:32.857
It's 11 months and 13 days.

00:34:33.497 --> 00:34:35.536
It'll be 11 months and 14 days soon.

00:34:35.937 --> 00:34:36.656
Well,

00:34:36.656 --> 00:34:38.136
Captain Leng, we had an agreement.

00:34:38.136 --> 00:34:40.056
It'd just be a few months
for transition, right?

00:34:40.056 --> 00:34:41.616
But it's been almost a year now.

00:34:41.857 --> 00:34:43.616
I seriously can't live with him anymore.

00:34:43.616 --> 00:34:44.696
Find me a single room

00:34:44.696 --> 00:34:45.576
or make him leave.

00:34:46.136 --> 00:34:47.817
I'm keeping the single room in mind.

00:34:48.656 --> 00:34:49.497
If one's available,

00:34:49.616 --> 00:34:51.056
you'll get it first.

00:34:51.056 --> 00:34:52.176
Just hurry up.

00:34:52.297 --> 00:34:54.017
Did you have a conflict with Ye Qian?

00:34:54.536 --> 00:34:55.536
No conflict between us.

00:34:55.536 --> 00:34:56.696
We get along great.

00:34:56.696 --> 00:34:57.857
He's great with others too.

00:34:57.857 --> 00:34:58.176
Really?

00:34:58.176 --> 00:34:59.736
Then let him live with others.

00:34:59.937 --> 00:35:00.857
I can't live with him.

00:35:00.857 --> 00:35:02.897
I can't stand his habits.

00:35:02.897 --> 00:35:04.017
Stay strong for six months.

00:35:04.536 --> 00:35:06.136
By the way, I have a task for you.

00:36:17.977 --> 00:36:19.696
We've been here quite a while.

00:36:20.857 --> 00:36:22.216
Why hasn't anyone shown up?

00:36:23.777 --> 00:36:24.616
Be patient.

00:36:54.417 --> 00:36:56.656
We agreed on no alcohol before coming.

00:36:57.696 --> 00:37:00.176
It's fine. Just a little.

00:37:01.417 --> 00:37:02.616
We're just waiting anyway.

00:37:03.216 --> 00:37:04.656
This place is full of cameras.

00:37:04.857 --> 00:37:06.696
Bao Hei's people
are definitely watching us.

00:37:06.696 --> 00:37:07.977
Don't mess up the mission.

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:27.287
(Bao Hei's Garden)

00:38:00.417 --> 00:38:02.297
Hands off what's not yours,

00:38:02.297 --> 00:38:04.337
and mind off what's not your business.

00:38:05.297 --> 00:38:07.576
All these years with me,
how can you not remember?

00:38:07.736 --> 00:38:08.497
You forgot?

00:38:08.497 --> 00:38:10.176
Did you forget? Did you?

00:38:15.497 --> 00:38:16.297
Regretting it?

00:38:17.536 --> 00:38:18.297
Too late.

00:38:35.377 --> 00:38:36.176
Well?

00:38:37.777 --> 00:38:39.897
I'd say one's got decent composure.

00:38:40.056 --> 00:38:40.817
Look.

00:38:40.977 --> 00:38:42.176
But the other one...

00:38:43.536 --> 00:38:44.897
Zoom in on that woman.

00:38:50.857 --> 00:38:51.977
Were they checked at entry?

00:38:52.536 --> 00:38:53.937
Checked. No weapons.

00:38:55.777 --> 00:38:57.457
They've waited for hours.

00:38:58.017 --> 00:38:58.937
Should we...

00:38:59.056 --> 00:39:00.937
The bottle's open.
Let them enjoy themselves.

00:39:31.616 --> 00:39:32.937
Regroup! Regroup now!

00:39:33.136 --> 00:39:34.337
Push A site!

00:39:34.497 --> 00:39:35.977
Careful! Dodge!

00:39:36.457 --> 00:39:37.777
Smoke! Go!

00:39:38.256 --> 00:39:40.256
Watch your positioning.
Stop blocking me.

00:39:40.256 --> 00:39:41.017
Seriously.

00:39:41.777 --> 00:39:42.656
What are you doing?

00:39:42.656 --> 00:39:44.017
You flashed our teammate.

00:39:44.897 --> 00:39:46.417
So annoying. Get it together.

00:39:46.536 --> 00:39:48.417
Can't hold loot. Can't push sites.

00:39:48.536 --> 00:39:49.377
Si Yuanlong.

00:39:49.377 --> 00:39:50.136
Faster.

00:39:50.136 --> 00:39:51.777
What's this? Can we just regroup?

00:39:53.297 --> 00:39:54.457
You idiot.

00:39:54.736 --> 00:39:55.417
Si Yuanlong.

00:39:55.736 --> 00:39:57.256
Hurry! Dodge!

00:39:57.256 --> 00:39:58.216
Just go to B.

00:40:00.457 --> 00:40:01.136
What are...

00:40:05.576 --> 00:40:06.176
What's wrong?

00:40:06.497 --> 00:40:07.337
Keep your voice down.

00:40:07.937 --> 00:40:08.616
Okay.

00:40:12.337 --> 00:40:13.216
If you can't sleep,

00:40:13.216 --> 00:40:15.977
just get up instead of blaming me.

00:40:16.136 --> 00:40:17.136
How about I carry you?

00:40:17.136 --> 00:40:18.216
I'm a pro now.

00:40:18.497 --> 00:40:19.297
Let's play a few.

00:40:22.017 --> 00:40:22.897
In or not?

00:40:35.176 --> 00:40:35.800
The trash can.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:36.760
I didn't cross the line.

00:40:46.417 --> 00:40:49.497
Hey. W-Where are you going?

00:40:53.216 --> 00:40:54.017
Not your business.

00:40:55.457 --> 00:40:56.616
What's your problem?

00:40:56.616 --> 00:40:57.536
I didn't provoke you.

00:40:57.536 --> 00:40:58.536
What's that attitude?

00:41:03.256 --> 00:41:04.817
I don't want to babysit you either.

00:41:04.817 --> 00:41:07.736
But your master ordered me
to keep an eye on you

00:41:07.736 --> 00:41:09.017
and keep you out of trouble.

00:41:09.017 --> 00:41:10.977
Otherwise,
they'll take you off the case.

00:41:11.056 --> 00:41:12.576
Reassigning you to desk duty

00:41:12.576 --> 00:41:14.297
to keep you away from CID
is possible too.

00:41:14.297 --> 00:41:15.497
Your master could do that.

00:41:15.656 --> 00:41:17.136
I just want to take a walk

00:41:17.497 --> 00:41:18.256
and get some air.

00:41:18.576 --> 00:41:20.017
Well, I also want to take a walk

00:41:20.017 --> 00:41:21.216
and get some air.

00:41:21.576 --> 00:41:22.616
You annoy me.

00:41:22.616 --> 00:41:23.696
I need a moment alone.

00:41:29.017 --> 00:41:30.457
I annoy myself too.

00:41:30.777 --> 00:41:33.096
But the captain gave me the task

00:41:33.096 --> 00:41:34.216
to watch you closely.

00:41:34.216 --> 00:41:35.616
If I lose sight of you,

00:41:35.616 --> 00:41:36.817
both of us will be punished.

00:41:37.977 --> 00:41:38.817
So let's go together.

00:41:42.216 --> 00:41:43.017
Don't regret it.

00:42:07.017 --> 00:42:07.777
Awesome.

00:42:09.817 --> 00:42:10.576
Little Qian,

00:42:11.736 --> 00:42:12.696
it's such a blast.

00:42:12.897 --> 00:42:14.616
We've been living together
for a year now.

00:42:16.216 --> 00:42:17.736
Why didn't you bring me here sooner?

00:42:19.788 --> 00:42:24.726
(Off-Road Motorcycle Race)

00:42:30.968 --> 00:42:32.817
Is this how you do business?

00:42:33.528 --> 00:42:35.096
Gosh! I'm out!

00:42:35.417 --> 00:42:37.696
Find whoever you want to work with.

00:42:41.216 --> 00:42:42.136
No one's coming?

00:42:44.377 --> 00:42:45.176
No one?

00:42:45.497 --> 00:42:46.417
Not coming, huh?

00:42:48.736 --> 00:42:49.817
Not coming, is that it?
