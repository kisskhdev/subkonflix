=You Came on to Me First=

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.200
What are you trying to do?

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.280
So what if you won't allow it?

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.240
Yan Che.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.000
I won't let you hurt him.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.870
You really want to defend him?

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.920
Do you know what kind of person he is?

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.280
Of course, I do.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.480
He and I grew up together.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.760
Why must you always harm the innocent?

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.070
Get lost.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.430
If I tell you that he's a man

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.000
with a deceitful heart now,

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.590
would you believe me?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.560
If you can show me proof,

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.120
then I'll believe you.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.150
Che is

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.590
kind and sincere at his core.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.190
Ying Du,

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.760
I believe he'd never harm me.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.190
Suit yourself.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.640
I'm done caring.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.960
(Ying Du,)

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.760
(if what Oracle says is true,)

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.433
(and we're destined to walk)

00:01:56.444 --> 00:01:58.000
(toward an ending of mutual hatred,)

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.710
(can I change)

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.480
(this tragic fate)

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.400
(by keeping my distance from you?)

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.920
Your Majesty,

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:11.490
Zhaoli asked me

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.140
to deliver this ring to you.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.980
I don't want it.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:14.820
Alright then.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.200
Courting death?

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.030
This shabby ring

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.280
looks hideous,

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.470
but the size is just right.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.870
(Maybe)

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.360
(he'll throw the ring away)

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.520
(because he's upset with me.)

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.620
Zhaoli!

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.770
- Zhaoli!
- Zhaoli!

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.640
Zhaoli!

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:01.503
Zhaoli, where are you?

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.840
Zhaoli, where are you?

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.080
- Zhaoli!
- Zhaoli!

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.590
Where's Zhaoli?

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.560
Slow down, Grandmother.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.430
Where's Zhaoli?

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:10.520
Zhaoli!

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.150
No sign of her.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.500
Who could it be

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.030
that took Zhaoli away?

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.640
I only saw

00:03:16.651 --> 00:03:17.597
someone dressed in black

00:03:17.608 --> 00:03:19.190
with their face hidden and head covered.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.400
He knocked Zhaoli unconscious

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.680
and carried her away.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.560
Zhaoli is gone?

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.790
- What do we do?
- Hurry.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.400
But if she was knocked out,

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:26.910
why do I feel no pain?

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.960
You, head over there.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.510
Hurry up.

00:03:29.563 --> 00:03:30.849
- Over there.
- Search that way.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.630
(This ring)

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.520
(can block pain.)

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.360
Zhaoli.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.150
Your Majesty,

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.030
have you forgotten the Frostbite Curse?

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.560
Only when Zhaoli dies

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.750
can you survive.

00:03:54.756 --> 00:03:55.800
It seems Zhaoli has learned

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.360
of the backlash from my power.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.150
So, she gave me

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.430
this ring

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.870
to block my pain.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.080
She'd rather put herself in danger

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.710
than let me be caught up in it.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.990
Step aside.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.680
Your Majesty,

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.150
this must be a trap set
by the man in black.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.430
You've lost your power now.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.560
You can't risk it.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.120
I swore I'd protect her.

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:20.110
Your Majesty.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.080
Your Majesty,

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:27.800
please, wear this.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:32.790
Your Majesty.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.240
Your Highness,

00:04:42.633 --> 00:04:43.560
if you want to kill me,

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.980
why not

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.480
do it now?

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.560
The ruler is ready to kill me for you.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.510
How could I let you die so easily?

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.630
I'll make sure you suffer first.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.750
You made the ruler wear
the Soulfall Ring.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.950
He can't feel the pain you're in.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.870
So, don't expect him to come save you.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.510
How do you know about the Soulfall Ring?

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.270
Go on.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.470
Ying Du.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.750
Only when you're gone

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.360
will the ruler be mine again.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.150
Zhaoli.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:45.470
Ying Du.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.870
Why?

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.480
Why?

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.320
Your Majesty,

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.240
I met you first.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.950
I've been by your side all along.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.270
Why have you never spared me a glance?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.070
Why would you betray

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.870
my love?

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:03.800
I never made promises.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.966
So, there's nothing to betray.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.000
Ye Li,

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.360
your love

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.040
should not be spent on me.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.070
So what?

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.430
I am but a woman,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
hoping the one I adore feels the same.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.270
Is that wrong?

00:06:20.803 --> 00:06:22.289
Seeking true affection is never wrong,

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.390
but you should not ally
with those of ill intent

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.920
for your own desires

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.630
and harm the innocent folk.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.720
Last time, I spared your life.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.240
Yet you grew worse, showing no remorse.

00:06:32.795 --> 00:06:34.669
Then the dungeon
shall be your place to repent.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.520
Ying Du,

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.750
it is you who turned me into this.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.000
I despise you.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.240
Let's go home.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:55.270
Alright.

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:17.350
I'm sorry.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.920
It's not your fault.

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.040
Why are you apologizing?

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.430
It all started because of me.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:33.830
Since you admit your fault,

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.630
you must accept the punishment.

00:07:36.823 --> 00:07:38.096
Let's put on the medicine first.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.000
My wound has been treated.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.240
Yours hasn't yet.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.910
Zhaoli,

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:16.950
what are you

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:18.720
thinking now?

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.000
I...

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.070
I'm not thinking of anything.

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:36.870
Zhaoli,

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.000
I don't care what's on your mind,

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:40.840
but you'd better stop it.

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:42.750
Otherwise...

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:45.470
I...

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:48.296
I'm not thinking of anything.

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:04.470
Zhaoli,

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.080
you came on to me first this time.
