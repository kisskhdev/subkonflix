WEBVTT

00:00:05.527 --> 00:00:07.237
Stimulants, narcotics, cannabis.

00:00:08.738 --> 00:00:11.032
People who have used these drugs

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:14.119
are now estimated
to total two million in Japan.

00:00:15.286 --> 00:00:18.164
The number of people arrested
for drug-related offenses

00:00:18.748 --> 00:00:20.458
is as many as 14,000 yearly.

00:00:25.213 --> 00:00:26.673
Hand over the cocaine.

00:00:26.756 --> 00:00:28.383
Not unless you have the cash for it.

00:00:30.468 --> 00:00:33.054
If that Mad Dog finds out about this case…

00:00:33.138 --> 00:00:34.889
Then get this over with quickly,

00:00:35.598 --> 00:00:36.808
police mutt.

00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:38.059
Get lost,

00:00:38.893 --> 00:00:40.395
Ministry mutt.

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:46.234
You've been knee-deep
in crime for all this time.

00:00:46.317 --> 00:00:47.318
Don't move!

00:00:47.402 --> 00:00:49.112
Don't start thinking you can escape.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.996
Regional Bureau of Health and Welfare,
Narcotics Control Department.

00:01:11.676 --> 00:01:13.261
I'll give you a chance.

00:01:14.804 --> 00:01:15.847
Become my "S."

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.765
- What's an S?
- A spy.

00:01:19.726 --> 00:01:20.894
Okay.

00:01:20.977 --> 00:01:22.437
Okay, what?

00:01:25.356 --> 00:01:26.399
I will…

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:28.860
become your S.

00:01:32.363 --> 00:01:34.782
You'll be my dog from today onwards.

00:01:39.662 --> 00:01:42.665
You better not have
snitched to the cops about us.

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:44.459
I didn't.

00:01:44.542 --> 00:01:46.210
I ran away just before.

00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:51.299
The guys who got snatched were part-timers
who didn't know about you.

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.259
No need to worry.

00:01:53.801 --> 00:01:55.595
Fucking cops.

00:01:55.678 --> 00:01:59.057
Actually, they were
narcotics agents, not cops.

00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:01.559
What's it fucking matter?

00:02:01.643 --> 00:02:03.228
I'm sorry.

00:02:03.311 --> 00:02:05.313
And? What about the merchandise?

00:02:07.815 --> 00:02:08.942
They took all of it.

00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:16.157
Your quota will be three million a month
starting next month to make up for it.

00:02:16.241 --> 00:02:17.492
Three million?

00:02:17.575 --> 00:02:20.703
That's too much!
Two million is tough enough already.

00:02:25.208 --> 00:02:29.128
You're the one who let them
raid the damn place, shithead.

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.299
But I really can't do three million.

00:02:33.383 --> 00:02:34.759
Yeah, I hear you.

00:02:36.511 --> 00:02:39.681
I'll let you in on an easy way
to make three million.

00:02:44.936 --> 00:02:46.271
Seen him before?

00:02:46.354 --> 00:02:47.480
HIBIKI KAGA

00:02:47.563 --> 00:02:49.941
Yes. He's that former boxer?

00:02:50.608 --> 00:02:52.485
Hibiki Kaga.

00:02:53.695 --> 00:02:56.531
He's a hick who thinks he's a bigshot.

00:02:56.614 --> 00:03:00.159
Rumor is that he uses speed or coke.

00:03:00.743 --> 00:03:01.786
What?

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:04.205
Hard to believe, right?

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:08.251
He acts like a friendly,
upstanding guy on TV.

00:03:09.002 --> 00:03:13.089
But they say he drugs women
and has his way with them.

00:03:13.172 --> 00:03:17.677
Your job is to make him a customer.

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:19.971
Seriously?

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:24.934
Celebrities are all swimming in cash.

00:03:25.518 --> 00:03:29.105
Make the right connections
and you can easily make three million.

00:03:29.188 --> 00:03:30.523
But how?

00:03:30.606 --> 00:03:34.944
You're a former celebrity too,
so use your own damn brain for once!

00:03:37.572 --> 00:03:39.240
What is it?

00:03:39.324 --> 00:03:41.075
You got a problem?

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.017
Hey, I'm going to grab a bite.
Want to join me?

00:04:48.101 --> 00:04:48.935
What?

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.564
I'll have some, then.

00:05:03.241 --> 00:05:07.495
Premium sea urchin
has a rather mature taste.

00:05:10.998 --> 00:05:13.126
Nice. Have some more.

00:06:18.733 --> 00:06:19.775
Hello?

00:06:19.859 --> 00:06:20.860
Good morning.

00:06:20.943 --> 00:06:23.529
How are you? Feel any better?

00:06:25.031 --> 00:06:30.119
I don't… remember much about yesterday.

00:06:30.203 --> 00:06:31.996
Oh, yeah.

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:35.333
You said you felt sick
after eating that sushi.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.419
I had you rest in a hotel room.

00:06:38.502 --> 00:06:39.545
Remember that?

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:41.088
What?

00:06:42.173 --> 00:06:46.385
I've never lost my memory
like this before.

00:06:47.386 --> 00:06:48.471
Don't worry.

00:06:49.096 --> 00:06:50.932
You'll remember it sooner or later.

00:06:51.015 --> 00:06:52.683
What?

00:06:52.767 --> 00:06:54.852
I quite enjoyed it.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.105
- What…
- Sorry.

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:02.109
Filming is about to start.
I'll call you later.

00:07:22.421 --> 00:07:24.090
Why are you here?

00:07:27.343 --> 00:07:28.469
I'm coming in.

00:07:28.553 --> 00:07:30.805
You can't just barge in so suddenly.

00:07:30.888 --> 00:07:33.933
- Anything here you don't want me to see?
- No.

00:07:34.016 --> 00:07:36.185
Can I not have some privacy, though?

00:07:36.269 --> 00:07:37.228
No. I'm coming in.

00:07:37.311 --> 00:07:38.479
It's a basic right.

00:07:38.563 --> 00:07:40.856
- No. I'm coming in.
- Your shoes!

00:07:42.316 --> 00:07:44.694
Are you always this self-centered?

00:07:44.777 --> 00:07:46.404
Shut up. I'll arrest you.

00:07:46.487 --> 00:07:48.739
I'm getting pissed.

00:07:48.823 --> 00:07:50.283
Maybe I'll quit being an S.

00:07:50.783 --> 00:07:52.994
That hurts!

00:07:53.077 --> 00:07:55.288
{\an8}Ouch! Just kidding!

00:07:55.371 --> 00:07:57.290
{\an8}I'll do it! I'll be your S!

00:07:57.373 --> 00:07:58.708
{\an8}You sure?

00:07:58.791 --> 00:07:59.959
{\an8}I'll do it.

00:08:01.586 --> 00:08:03.713
It hurts.

00:08:03.796 --> 00:08:06.966
- You're out of control.
- Enough chitchat.

00:08:07.049 --> 00:08:09.010
Give me information.

00:08:10.052 --> 00:08:11.637
All right.

00:08:18.394 --> 00:08:21.439
- I see.
- Do you have to keep the shoes on?

00:08:24.025 --> 00:08:25.318
Hey, look.

00:08:25.401 --> 00:08:27.737
I gave you the info. Do the rest yourself.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:31.365
No. Follow Matsubara's orders.
Meet Kaga and make him ingest cocaine.

00:08:31.449 --> 00:08:32.950
Get it on video.

00:08:33.034 --> 00:08:34.327
What?

00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:37.413
How would I know
where Kaga does his cocaine?

00:08:37.496 --> 00:08:41.667
Plus, I'll get killed if Matsubara
finds out I'm connected to you!

00:08:41.751 --> 00:08:44.920
It's your own fault if you get found out.
Not my problem.

00:08:45.004 --> 00:08:46.130
Except it is!

00:08:46.213 --> 00:08:48.591
If they find out
I'm a spy for you and kill me,

00:08:48.674 --> 00:08:50.092
then it's on you!

00:08:50.176 --> 00:08:53.012
Wrong. Don't care. Shut up.
Don't blame others, criminal.

00:08:53.095 --> 00:08:54.388
That's going a bit far.

00:08:54.472 --> 00:08:57.266
- Don't you think so?
- I'll arrest you if you refuse.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:00.686
Not that again. Get off my back already.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.897
Yeah, I quit being your S.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.232
Hey, wait. I'm kidding!

00:09:05.858 --> 00:09:08.027
Please don't keep trying to arrest me.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:09.528
I'll do it.

00:09:12.531 --> 00:09:14.075
And we're back.

00:09:14.742 --> 00:09:16.952
You're too quick with those handcuffs.

00:09:17.036 --> 00:09:18.871
I'm too scared to talk to you.

00:09:21.499 --> 00:09:22.500
Answer it.

00:09:22.583 --> 00:09:23.834
Shut it, I was going to.

00:09:23.918 --> 00:09:25.419
- Answer.
- I will!

00:09:28.881 --> 00:09:30.466
Yes. Hello?

00:09:30.549 --> 00:09:31.884
Got a job for you.

00:09:32.468 --> 00:09:34.428
Go peddle goods at the cafe in Honmachi.

00:09:34.512 --> 00:09:36.305
Wait, right now?

00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:37.765
Don't ask questions.

00:09:37.848 --> 00:09:41.185
I'm helping you out here,
so you can meet your new quota.

00:09:41.727 --> 00:09:45.606
Screw this up, and get ready
to say goodbye to your precious organs.

00:09:46.899 --> 00:09:48.067
All right.

00:09:48.609 --> 00:09:49.652
I'll go.

00:09:52.905 --> 00:09:53.948
Too close!

00:09:54.615 --> 00:09:55.783
Why?

00:09:56.867 --> 00:09:58.202
Why, though?

00:10:06.711 --> 00:10:08.337
What is it?

00:10:08.421 --> 00:10:10.756
Why won't you answer my calls?

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:11.841
What do you want?

00:10:11.924 --> 00:10:14.468
Don't you care about your child?

00:10:14.552 --> 00:10:17.888
What? What are you on about?

00:10:17.972 --> 00:10:20.391
I gave you money to cover the abortion.

00:10:20.474 --> 00:10:22.059
What did you do to me?

00:10:22.685 --> 00:10:23.686
What do you mean?

00:10:24.895 --> 00:10:26.897
Did you use drugs on me?

00:10:26.981 --> 00:10:28.691
What are you saying?

00:10:28.774 --> 00:10:31.485
Sex with you never felt normal.

00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:35.781
I would suddenly lose my appetite,
and my mind would go all hazy.

00:10:35.865 --> 00:10:38.284
I told you, you just have
some kind of disease.

00:10:41.454 --> 00:10:42.580
It was cocaine.

00:10:44.123 --> 00:10:47.168
Don't just make shit up.

00:10:47.251 --> 00:10:50.004
I didn't even push you that hard!

00:10:50.087 --> 00:10:51.422
Stop it!

00:10:52.423 --> 00:10:54.759
You're making Aki cry.

00:10:54.842 --> 00:10:57.678
What? What are you even saying?

00:10:57.762 --> 00:10:59.054
No one is crying!

00:10:59.138 --> 00:11:00.806
It's okay, Aki.

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:02.725
He scared you, didn't he?

00:11:06.645 --> 00:11:08.481
That's a damn doll.

00:11:09.064 --> 00:11:10.524
You…

00:11:10.608 --> 00:11:12.568
You want money that badly?

00:11:14.028 --> 00:11:15.696
That's not what it's about!

00:11:16.197 --> 00:11:17.948
This is your fault!

00:11:18.032 --> 00:11:19.825
You did all of this!

00:11:19.909 --> 00:11:21.911
Screw that! Piss off!

00:11:22.578 --> 00:11:25.247
Get away from me! Buzz off!

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:39.720
I've been waiting for 30 minutes.
I don't see any customers.

00:11:39.803 --> 00:11:43.641
What? You messing with me?
You better be keeping your eyes open.

00:11:43.724 --> 00:11:46.685
They should be there somewhere.
Take another look.

00:11:48.646 --> 00:11:50.523
What a pain.

00:11:53.526 --> 00:11:54.777
Who are you guys?

00:11:55.486 --> 00:11:56.862
Police.

00:11:58.197 --> 00:12:01.242
Are you Kyonosuke Umezawa,
a dealer working for Matsubara?

00:12:01.325 --> 00:12:02.451
Come with us.

00:12:02.535 --> 00:12:05.079
Wait, hang on now.

00:12:05.162 --> 00:12:07.081
I think there has been a mistake.

00:12:07.164 --> 00:12:08.332
What mistake?

00:12:08.832 --> 00:12:10.334
Just think about it.

00:12:12.336 --> 00:12:14.713
Me? Come on.

00:12:16.632 --> 00:12:18.008
- Get him.
- Okay.

00:12:18.092 --> 00:12:19.802
Why? This makes no sense.

00:12:19.885 --> 00:12:21.345
Why am I getting arrested?

00:12:21.428 --> 00:12:23.180
Because you're a damn drug dealer!

00:12:23.264 --> 00:12:24.431
Shit!

00:12:25.724 --> 00:12:26.600
Hey!

00:12:28.227 --> 00:12:30.145
- Get him, damn it!
- Stop!

00:12:30.229 --> 00:12:32.231
- Chase him!
- Umezawa, you little shit!

00:12:32.314 --> 00:12:34.567
- You're not getting away!
- Move already!

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:35.526
After him!

00:12:35.609 --> 00:12:36.443
Umezawa!

00:12:36.527 --> 00:12:38.404
{\an8}Wait. Where's Kurosaki?

00:12:38.487 --> 00:12:40.281
{\an8}He's out patrolling.

00:12:40.364 --> 00:12:43.659
{\an8}Damn it. He's always going off on his own.

00:12:44.326 --> 00:12:45.828
Get back here!

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:48.956
Don't let him get away!

00:12:49.873 --> 00:12:51.125
Got you!

00:12:53.794 --> 00:12:55.170
Damn bastard!

00:12:55.879 --> 00:12:57.464
Why the hell is this happening?

00:12:57.548 --> 00:12:59.967
- Hurry!
- Just go already!

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:02.177
- Hurry up!
- Open it, quick!

00:13:02.261 --> 00:13:04.263
- You're in the damn way!
- Just go!

00:13:04.847 --> 00:13:09.184
Listen up. Katsuragi from the police
is also working this case.

00:13:09.268 --> 00:13:10.352
Get back here!

00:13:10.436 --> 00:13:11.937
Stop, damn it!

00:13:13.856 --> 00:13:14.898
Where is he?

00:13:14.982 --> 00:13:17.693
{\an8}NO TRESPASSING ALLOWED

00:13:17.776 --> 00:13:19.153
Hurry up and move!

00:13:19.236 --> 00:13:20.154
Go get him!

00:13:20.237 --> 00:13:24.366
EMERGENCY EXIT

00:13:27.453 --> 00:13:29.496
What? Who…

00:13:30.831 --> 00:13:32.416
Katsuragi, huh?

00:13:32.499 --> 00:13:35.502
Now, that's another troublesome fellow.

00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:39.632
Wait, Mr. Hainuma. Who is this Katsuragi?

00:13:39.715 --> 00:13:40.758
A Mad Dog!

00:13:40.841 --> 00:13:43.552
What? Doesn't that refer to Mr. Kurosaki?

00:13:43.636 --> 00:13:45.512
Kurosaki is the NCD's Mad Dog.

00:13:45.596 --> 00:13:47.765
Katsuragi is the police's Mad Dog.

00:13:52.561 --> 00:13:55.773
MPD, Narcotics and Firearms Division,
Akito Katsuragi.

00:13:56.523 --> 00:13:57.733
Yeah?

00:14:13.957 --> 00:14:15.334
Caught red-handed.

00:14:15.417 --> 00:14:17.961
Wait. Why am I getting arrested?

00:14:18.045 --> 00:14:19.672
That wasn't the deal!

00:14:20.214 --> 00:14:23.550
Didn't I become an S for you people?

00:14:23.634 --> 00:14:26.512
So why the hell am I getting arrested?

00:14:29.264 --> 00:14:32.476
What a funny thing to say.
What do you mean by S?

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:37.272
Like I said, I made a deal
agreeing to become an S for the NCD.

00:14:37.356 --> 00:14:40.025
Didn't they tell you?
Why are you arresting me?

00:14:40.109 --> 00:14:41.235
Whose S?

00:14:41.318 --> 00:14:42.695
A narcotics agent.

00:14:43.362 --> 00:14:45.364
His name is Kurosaki.

00:14:46.031 --> 00:14:47.324
Kurosaki?

00:14:51.412 --> 00:14:52.705
Interesting.

00:14:52.788 --> 00:14:54.999
Tell me more at the station.

00:14:56.709 --> 00:14:58.460
To hell with that!

00:15:00.087 --> 00:15:01.672
Too bad.

00:15:01.755 --> 00:15:03.590
That's obstruction of justice.

00:15:05.884 --> 00:15:08.637
That's not funny, damn it.

00:15:15.728 --> 00:15:16.979
I see.

00:15:17.813 --> 00:15:20.482
So that's how you gave
my subordinates the slip.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.401
You've had training?

00:15:22.985 --> 00:15:24.319
Shut up.

00:15:26.989 --> 00:15:29.366
That said, you're still just an amateur.

00:15:31.243 --> 00:15:32.369
Ow!

00:15:35.622 --> 00:15:39.376
His father and elder brother
are both University of Tokyo graduates,

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:41.170
and have successful careers.

00:15:41.253 --> 00:15:43.589
He's the only one
who didn't get into UTokyo,

00:15:43.672 --> 00:15:46.008
so he's got a bunch of issues around that.

00:15:46.091 --> 00:15:49.762
That's why he tries to upstage his family
by racking up successes.

00:15:51.472 --> 00:15:52.556
Close call.

00:16:08.405 --> 00:16:11.408
Kurosaki's driving force
is the eradication of illegal drugs.

00:16:11.492 --> 00:16:13.118
For Katsuragi, it's his career.

00:16:13.202 --> 00:16:15.704
And they'll both use any means necessary.

00:16:16.747 --> 00:16:18.457
They're both Mad Dogs.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:20.834
Wouldn't want to get on their bad sides.

00:16:23.504 --> 00:16:25.464
Speak of the devil.

00:16:59.289 --> 00:17:00.582
Is this allowed?

00:17:00.666 --> 00:17:02.209
For a cop to be this violent?

00:17:02.292 --> 00:17:03.544
Shut the hell up!

00:17:05.754 --> 00:17:10.175
You're the one adding to your crimes
by being violent towards a cop!

00:17:10.676 --> 00:17:13.637
I'm only employing violence
in response to that.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:18.475
Heck, I could even kill a meth dealer
and not get in legal trouble for it.

00:17:18.559 --> 00:17:19.476
Well?

00:17:20.602 --> 00:17:23.814
What you've been trying
to attack all this time

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:26.358
is the state's authority.

00:17:45.627 --> 00:17:48.797
You're a dead man.

00:17:52.885 --> 00:17:54.136
That poor Umezawa.

00:17:54.219 --> 00:17:56.889
Bet he didn't think he would get busted.

00:17:56.972 --> 00:17:59.433
He can't even pay his quota.

00:17:59.516 --> 00:18:02.561
It's better to get rid
of useless trash like him,

00:18:02.644 --> 00:18:05.314
and earn some favors with the cops.

00:18:07.149 --> 00:18:09.026
Heck yeah!

00:18:18.493 --> 00:18:21.997
{\an8}Guess you made the wrong move
teaming up with Kurosaki.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.123
{\an8}What?

00:18:23.207 --> 00:18:24.541
{\an8}What's going on?

00:18:25.542 --> 00:18:27.586
I looked into you.

00:18:29.755 --> 00:18:31.423
Made your acting debut at five,

00:18:31.506 --> 00:18:33.884
and your delinquent film
at fifteen was a hit,

00:18:33.967 --> 00:18:36.011
giving you a little popularity.

00:18:36.094 --> 00:18:38.639
Did you learn some martial arts
for that film?

00:18:40.015 --> 00:18:41.016
Yeah.

00:18:42.226 --> 00:18:44.603
Real fighting isn't about
what looks good on screen, idiot.

00:18:46.563 --> 00:18:49.316
You got cocky after starring
in that delinquent film,

00:18:49.399 --> 00:18:51.276
then got violent while drunk
and caused an incident.

00:18:52.194 --> 00:18:54.446
Got suspended,
so you did illegal gambling.

00:18:54.529 --> 00:18:56.990
Got into deep debt,
then started doing shady work.

00:18:57.074 --> 00:18:59.910
Then you got blackmailed
into becoming a meth dealer.

00:19:00.869 --> 00:19:02.162
What a clichéd downfall!

00:19:02.246 --> 00:19:03.413
Shut it!

00:19:05.666 --> 00:19:08.585
You barely put in effort,
but you dare to dream big.

00:19:08.669 --> 00:19:12.005
You got success through luck,
then lost it all to your own actions.

00:19:12.089 --> 00:19:13.674
You hid, ran, and made excuses.

00:19:13.757 --> 00:19:17.302
Your life is as flimsy as paper!
And you've reached a dead end.

00:19:17.386 --> 00:19:19.763
Your luck is out
for this go at life. Wait.

00:19:19.846 --> 00:19:22.474
Don't think your future lives
will go any better. Tough luck!

00:19:24.434 --> 00:19:27.020
You get violent as soon
as you get pissed off, huh?

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:31.233
Want to find out what happens
if you hurt a cop during interrogation?

00:19:31.942 --> 00:19:33.819
I got arrested for dealing drugs.

00:19:33.902 --> 00:19:35.862
I'm serving four to five years, anyway.

00:19:35.946 --> 00:19:38.282
Why not punch you and serve one more?

00:19:38.365 --> 00:19:41.952
After all, my luck is out
for this go at life.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.372
Actually, it might not be.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.960
There's one way for you to remain free.

00:19:50.043 --> 00:19:51.545
What?

00:19:51.628 --> 00:19:53.797
How is that even possible?

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.718
I want you to become my S.

00:19:57.801 --> 00:19:58.802
That's the condition.

00:19:59.469 --> 00:20:01.430
But I'm already an S for the NCD--

00:20:01.513 --> 00:20:04.599
No, I want you to be an S for the police.

00:20:04.683 --> 00:20:06.935
What? Aren't you on the same side?

00:20:07.019 --> 00:20:08.061
No.

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:10.147
The NCD takes orders

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:12.691
from the Minister of Health,
Labor and Welfare.

00:20:12.774 --> 00:20:15.736
They're a separate organization
from us police.

00:20:15.819 --> 00:20:18.405
Like different companies
in the private sector.

00:20:18.488 --> 00:20:23.160
And those separate organizations are both
after the same target. Drug traffickers.

00:20:24.828 --> 00:20:28.248
Well, not that a bottom-feeder
like you would understand,

00:20:28.332 --> 00:20:32.169
but bureaucracies like us are always
competing over accomplishments.

00:20:32.252 --> 00:20:33.378
To summarize,

00:20:34.171 --> 00:20:36.590
my promotion is on the line, dumbass.

00:20:37.716 --> 00:20:39.426
Promotion?

00:20:39.509 --> 00:20:42.679
If the all-powerful police
gets outdone by the lowly NCD,

00:20:42.763 --> 00:20:44.473
it will hurt my prospects.

00:20:44.556 --> 00:20:47.351
Conversely, if I can beat them
to the punch,

00:20:47.434 --> 00:20:48.852
I get a promotion.

00:20:49.436 --> 00:20:50.687
To that end,

00:20:51.271 --> 00:20:52.981
I want you to be my dog.

00:20:54.691 --> 00:20:58.236
I'm impressed at how many scummy lines
you can spout one after another.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.363
Listen well.

00:20:59.446 --> 00:21:01.448
You'll pretend to be an S for the NCD,

00:21:01.531 --> 00:21:04.493
and leak their information
to the police as an S for us.

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:06.536
You mean like…

00:21:07.662 --> 00:21:08.997
A double agent.

00:21:10.248 --> 00:21:11.458
What if I get caught?

00:21:11.541 --> 00:21:12.626
Just don't.

00:21:12.709 --> 00:21:14.044
Don't make it sound easy!

00:21:14.127 --> 00:21:15.420
Aren't you good at acting?

00:21:19.966 --> 00:21:21.218
What's in it for me?

00:21:22.469 --> 00:21:23.595
Let me think.

00:21:24.096 --> 00:21:25.097
Right.

00:21:25.889 --> 00:21:29.309
I'll negate whatever dirt
Kurosaki has on you.

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:47.869
Choose the wrong person
to wag your tail to,

00:21:47.953 --> 00:21:51.123
and the rest of your life
will be nothing but hell.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:54.835
Is that even allowed?

00:21:55.419 --> 00:21:58.797
That's the power of plea bargains for you.

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.340
Yeah, right.

00:22:00.424 --> 00:22:01.591
Listen.

00:22:02.259 --> 00:22:07.347
Think long and hard
about who you ought to side with.

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:12.519
The police or the NCD?

00:22:14.729 --> 00:22:17.607
Me or Kurosaki?

00:22:31.955 --> 00:22:33.540
{\an8}Enough already.

00:22:33.623 --> 00:22:36.835
{\an8}Every one of you keeps demanding
whatever you want.

00:22:38.628 --> 00:22:42.340
{\an8}I don't care if it's the police
or the NCD, I'll be your damn S!

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:47.304
{\an8}But just remember one thing.

00:22:51.057 --> 00:22:53.435
{\an8}Don't think you can tame me that easily.

00:23:04.237 --> 00:23:05.405
{\an8}At any rate,

00:23:05.488 --> 00:23:09.326
{\an8}make sure we get the ringleader
behind this case before the police do!

00:23:09.409 --> 00:23:10.577
{\an8}Yes, sir!

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.720
{\an8}The college student from before.

00:23:28.803 --> 00:23:31.556
{\an8}Another case of addiction,
like it always goes?

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:34.100
{\an8}I have some info. Do you want it?

00:23:34.851 --> 00:23:37.145
{\an8}- Ouch!
- I'll take down Kaga.

00:23:37.229 --> 00:23:39.564
{\an8}That's why I'm letting you roam free.

00:23:39.648 --> 00:23:41.441
{\an8}You just do as I tell you to.

00:23:42.108 --> 00:23:43.109
{\an8}No way.

00:23:43.193 --> 00:23:44.569
{\an8}Why?

00:23:44.653 --> 00:23:45.904
{\an8}Why are you crying?

00:23:45.987 --> 00:23:47.864
{\an8}It's just a drug addict who died.

00:23:47.948 --> 00:23:49.115
{\an8}KUROSAKI IS UNUSUALLY DISTRESSED

00:23:49.199 --> 00:23:51.409
{\an8}- Get lost!
- Have it your way!

00:23:51.493 --> 00:23:55.038
{\an8}THE MAD DOG AND HIS S PART WAYS ALREADY?

00:23:55.121 --> 00:24:01.002
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO ACTUAL PERSONS,
GROUPS, OR CASES IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL

00:24:01.086 --> 00:24:02.003
