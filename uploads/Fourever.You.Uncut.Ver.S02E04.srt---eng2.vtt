WEBVTT

00:00:09.343 --> 00:00:14.164
In the end, I chose to hurt the person I loved the most.

00:00:14.502 --> 00:00:16.834
All to protect another person I loved.

00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:19.774
So, what was the very first thing you gave P'Fah again?

00:00:20.125 --> 00:00:21.528
- What the hell was it?
- A sandwich and chocolate milk.

00:00:22.143 --> 00:00:25.263
Do you really think this is a good idea?

00:00:25.802 --> 00:00:29.201
Of course it is. You’ve come this far—you can’t back out now.

00:00:29.637 --> 00:00:31.120
What, do you think I’m some kind of delivery rider?

00:00:32.302 --> 00:00:36.752
It’s not that bad.
But if this is all it amounts to, then so be it.

00:00:41.297 --> 00:00:42.805
Please give this to the owner of the letter.

00:00:43.611 --> 00:00:44.810
Sure.

00:00:52.277 --> 00:00:54.016
So… you like him, huh?

00:00:54.885 --> 00:00:56.429
Not to the point of liking him yet.

00:00:56.791 --> 00:00:58.139
I just want to get to know him better.

00:01:01.263 --> 00:01:02.749
Do you even know who it is?

00:01:03.048 --> 00:01:04.019
I don’t.

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:06.520
Don’t you want to know?

00:01:07.321 --> 00:01:11.346
Judging by how he had someone else pass it on,
He clearly don’t want me to know.

00:01:11.626 --> 00:01:14.343
If he don’t want me to know, then I won’t.

00:01:14.943 --> 00:01:16.202
But I do want to know.

00:01:17.546 --> 00:01:20.388
Fah, I’ve got a question for you.

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:23.570
Normally, lots of people give you things.

00:01:24.629 --> 00:01:26.717
So why does this one stand out, huh?

00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:30.520
I don’t really know how to explain it.

00:01:32.774 --> 00:01:36.069
Reading the messages just makes me feel at ease.

00:01:36.755 --> 00:01:39.355
They’re simple, ordinary messages.

00:01:40.518 --> 00:01:43.792
He never ask anything or expect a reply.

00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:47.117
The only thing he hope for is that I’m doing well.

00:01:47.548 --> 00:01:48.991
That’s all.

00:02:02.404 --> 00:02:06.755
It feels like I could just float away.

00:02:07.152 --> 00:02:08.480
I get it.

00:02:09.955 --> 00:02:12.112
Do you think P'Fah knows it’s you?

00:02:13.151 --> 00:02:14.508
That he likes you?

00:02:16.065 --> 00:02:17.374
Or that he likes the person in the letters?

00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:26.512
If he feels good about the person in the letters,

00:02:26.656 --> 00:02:27.980
that’s not such a bad thing, right?

00:02:28.854 --> 00:02:30.488
Because the real Typhoon—

00:02:30.871 --> 00:02:32.905
can’t even bring himself to talk to P'Fah.

00:02:33.472 --> 00:02:35.078
But the person in the letters can do it.

00:02:36.598 --> 00:02:37.582
- Phoon.
- Hmm?

00:02:38.454 --> 00:02:39.616
Can I ask you something?

00:02:40.531 --> 00:02:41.687
Just hypothetically.

00:02:42.023 --> 00:02:42.893
If today—

00:02:43.185 --> 00:02:44.518
your dad wasn’t involved at all,

00:02:45.807 --> 00:02:47.597
would you still try to get close to P'Fah?

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.674
I guess I would—

00:02:53.183 --> 00:02:54.961
take better care of P'Fah.

00:02:55.626 --> 00:03:01.287
Not just writing letters, not just buying things and telling him to take care of himself.

00:03:02.554 --> 00:03:03.976
Good job, maew.

00:03:05.751 --> 00:03:09.517
But honestly, I think P'Fah would like you no matter what.

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:12.198
Even if he knew you were the one behind the letters.

00:03:12.616 --> 00:03:17.543
Because P'Fah probably likes how caring you are
and knows that you truly love him.

00:03:24.321 --> 00:03:27.648
Hey, stop it. Phoon’s about to explode.

00:03:28.195 --> 00:03:29.151
You really mean that?

00:03:30.155 --> 00:03:31.288
See? Proof.

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:36.942
Maybe he just bought things back for everyone or something.

00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:41.848
Come on. How could P'Fah buy things back for everyone?
So many people give him stuff.

00:03:42.171 --> 00:03:44.580
It has to be someone special.

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.173
No matter what, P'Fah likes you.

00:03:48.477 --> 00:03:49.798
Are you taking my side?

00:03:50.481 --> 00:03:52.334
Yeah, maybe a little.

00:03:52.617 --> 00:03:56.623
Why not? I’m your friend.
I’m supposed to support you all the way.

00:03:56.791 --> 00:04:00.357
Even North supports you that much—how could I fall behind?

00:04:00.562 --> 00:04:04.082
By now he might’ve already done some voodoo on P'Fah for you.

00:04:05.885 --> 00:04:11.084
Well, good then. I feel like the vibe’s gotten brighter somehow.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.373
You don’t look like a sleepy cat anymore.

00:05:54.651 --> 00:05:57.785
See? I told you the plan would work. You guys just didn’t believe me.

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:00.010
Huh? Your plan?

00:06:00.217 --> 00:06:01.456
It was Dao’s plan.

00:06:01.583 --> 00:06:02.838
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:06:02.974 --> 00:06:07.063
But I’m the one who made the plan 80% successful.

00:06:07.493 --> 00:06:10.986
And do you know who found the delivery Cupid?

00:06:11.297 --> 00:06:12.195
Me.

00:06:13.715 --> 00:06:16.167
I’m freaking handsome.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.300
And talented too.

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:20.967
And I can't help about it.

00:06:21.505 --> 00:06:23.345
So annoying.

00:06:23.555 --> 00:06:25.496
Enough. Get up here already—so dramatic.

00:06:25.862 --> 00:06:27.022
This man.

00:06:28.152 --> 00:06:30.134
But do you know what the problem is right now?

00:06:30.554 --> 00:06:34.662
The problem is Phoon doesn’t believe P'Fah actually likes him.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.125
What are you talking about?

00:06:37.811 --> 00:06:41.325
At this point, I think P'Fah’s already preparing the engagement procession.

00:06:41.417 --> 00:06:42.468
Whoa.

00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:47.198
But I’ve spoiled enough already—you’re the real spoiler master.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:49.431
What are you even saying?

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:53.020
Does P'Fah know you're the one who wrote the letters?

00:06:58.343 --> 00:07:01.197
No, of course not. How would he know?

00:07:02.328 --> 00:07:05.219
But you never know—Phoon is someone close to him.

00:07:05.604 --> 00:07:08.554
Does P'Tonfah know that you like him?

00:07:11.971 --> 00:07:14.275
I think P'Fah knows that I like him.

00:07:15.001 --> 00:07:16.133
I think—

00:07:16.568 --> 00:07:18.131
he only sees me as a little brother.

00:07:18.712 --> 00:07:19.527
Hey.

00:07:20.288 --> 00:07:23.100
Why do you assume P'Fah only thinks of you as a brother?

00:07:23.903 --> 00:07:24.711
Yeah.

00:07:25.441 --> 00:07:27.808
Maybe because we know each other so well.

00:07:28.785 --> 00:07:33.205
It’s like he’s always trying to draw a line.

00:07:33.697 --> 00:07:35.731
And I’ve never crossed that line.

00:07:36.386 --> 00:07:39.591
Wait—if P'Fah finds out you’re the one who wrote the letters…

00:07:39.902 --> 00:07:42.122
Wouldn’t he draw that line again?

00:07:42.928 --> 00:07:47.306
That’s exactly why I don’t want him to know it’s me.

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:50.410
So you’re not even thinking of crossing that line at all?

00:07:51.348 --> 00:07:52.240
Yeah.

00:07:57.194 --> 00:07:58.588
I…

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:00.884
I’m scared of losing P'Fah.

00:08:01.562 --> 00:08:05.333
You’re scared of losing P'Fah, but aren’t you scared he might fall for someone else?

00:08:08.823 --> 00:08:10.100
Of course I am.

00:08:10.334 --> 00:08:12.499
Just thinking about it already kills me.

00:08:15.914 --> 00:08:16.949
So what do we do?

00:08:17.395 --> 00:08:19.358
I think there’s only one way.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:21.727
There is?

00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:23.352
And that is—

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.684
- Go for it!
- Hey! You scared me.

00:08:26.157 --> 00:08:27.900
Just fight for it. You have to fight.

00:08:28.044 --> 00:08:29.078
Fight or not?

00:08:29.385 --> 00:08:30.274
Fight.

00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:32.542
Hey, that’s weak. Fight or not!!!

00:08:33.031 --> 00:08:34.488
Fight!

00:08:34.825 --> 00:08:38.260
I’ll make P'Fah know just how much I love him.

00:08:38.885 --> 00:08:41.588
That’s right. Good job. Fight!!!

00:08:41.834 --> 00:08:43.128
Fight!

00:08:43.188 --> 00:08:46.118
This one’s loud, that one’s all soft.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.620
- You always ruin the mood.
- Just look at yourself.

00:08:57.011 --> 00:08:58.528
What are you doing, P'Hill?

00:08:58.734 --> 00:08:59.802
Does it look like me?

00:09:00.465 --> 00:09:03.048
It’s cute, but you shouldn’t be drawing it here.

00:09:03.482 --> 00:09:05.063
So you’ll think of me while you’re studying.

00:09:05.271 --> 00:09:07.678
Come on, even if I don’t study, I still think of you.

00:09:08.484 --> 00:09:12.515
Wow, you came so early—I thought you were serious about studying.

00:09:13.202 --> 00:09:15.734
Turns out you came to hang out with—

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.140
- What?
- Shut up already.

00:09:19.825 --> 00:09:22.380
- My friends are looking for me. I’m off to class, P'.
- Mm.

00:09:22.488 --> 00:09:24.091
- Study hard, okay?
- Yes.

00:09:25.103 --> 00:09:26.955
Make sure you eat something too, P'Hill.

00:09:27.921 --> 00:09:28.820
I’m going now.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.952
- Mm, bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

00:09:51.005 --> 00:09:53.312
You came this early—here to pick something up?

00:09:53.887 --> 00:09:54.714
Yeah.

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:56.588
Must be really important, huh?

00:09:59.891 --> 00:10:00.813
Yeah.

00:10:01.322 --> 00:10:02.830
Really important.

00:10:16.168 --> 00:10:18.816
"Really important, huh?" "Yeah, really important."

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.032
That much, huh.

00:10:23.275 --> 00:10:25.884
Which ship I am on always sailing smooth nonstop.

00:10:26.047 --> 00:10:27.825
Now it’s your turn.

00:10:29.934 --> 00:10:32.792
- Stop teasing me already.
- Ooh, someone’s enjoying it.

00:10:32.885 --> 00:10:35.394
Alright, alright.

00:10:35.419 --> 00:10:37.051
You always get rough when you’re shy.

00:10:38.838 --> 00:10:41.124
Can’t even tease you a little.

00:10:41.385 --> 00:10:44.023
You’re happy, huh. You’re shy, huh.

00:10:45.142 --> 00:10:47.303
Students, please sit properly.

00:11:06.048 --> 00:11:09.401
Enjoy your meal. Have a nice day.

00:11:32.976 --> 00:11:35.663
Wow, you walked right past without even looking at me.

00:11:36.682 --> 00:11:39.860
There you go—smile a lot.

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:20.296
Lift your head a bit. Or am I supposed to talk to the back of your neck?

00:12:20.933 --> 00:12:22.454
North.

00:12:22.825 --> 00:12:23.921
Your voice is crack.

00:12:24.672 --> 00:12:27.924
Dude, my heart’s about to jump out of my chest.

00:12:28.942 --> 00:12:30.331
Calm down, maew.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.226
Want some chocolate? Might help.

00:12:32.564 --> 00:12:34.202
I don’t want chocolate anymore.

00:12:34.317 --> 00:12:38.069
Oh? Not other people’s chocolate anymore?

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:42.038
Only P'Fah’s chocolate now?

00:12:42.068 --> 00:12:45.660
- You seriously won’t stop teasing me, huh?
- It’s funny when you’re shy.

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:51.597
Dude, is this like flirting through messages or what? Or—

00:12:51.997 --> 00:12:53.127
am I just imagining things?

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.210
Read my lips.

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:58.303
P'Fah is flirting with you.

00:12:58.548 --> 00:12:59.373
Got it?

00:13:00.318 --> 00:13:03.885
At first, I thought we’d just be pen pals.

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:08.420
Hey, how can it stay just talking? I told you—you have to go for it.

00:13:08.771 --> 00:13:10.548
Are you really going to stay in your safe zone like this?

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:13.139
If you do, you’ll be stuck in that safe zone forever.

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.020
I know.

00:13:15.728 --> 00:13:16.724
Just give me some time.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.537
Oh please, acting like you need time.

00:13:18.782 --> 00:13:20.848
You said you were going to flirt with P'Fah.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.693
Look at this—now P'Fah’s the one flirting with you.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.586
And you made him like you first like this—

00:13:26.586 --> 00:13:27.917
what are you gonna do?

00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:30.328
What do you mean, like me first?

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.380
Wow.

00:13:31.471 --> 00:13:34.530
So you’re really going to let “sweet like you” slip away?

00:13:34.677 --> 00:13:41.357
Then just tell him—“I’m sweeter than the chocolate you gave me.”

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:43.792
Throw in a little compliment, maybe.

00:13:43.922 --> 00:13:44.865
Why not try it?

00:13:45.842 --> 00:13:49.389
I still don’t even know where our relationship is headed.

00:13:49.968 --> 00:13:51.257
And there’s my dad too.

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:55.730
No matter what, I can’t reveal myself as the one in the letters.

00:13:56.114 --> 00:13:57.096
So what—

00:13:57.417 --> 00:13:59.628
you’re going to make him like you and then disappear?

00:14:00.668 --> 00:14:01.834
That’s cruel.

00:14:02.254 --> 00:14:04.340
I never said I was disappearing anywhere.

00:14:04.518 --> 00:14:06.749
You’ve already disappeared from P'Fah once before.

00:14:07.125 --> 00:14:08.749
You’re going to do it again this time?

00:14:09.075 --> 00:14:11.114
P'Fah would be really hurt.

00:14:11.613 --> 00:14:13.616
I don’t want it to end the same way again.

00:14:14.485 --> 00:14:15.955
I don’t want to see P'Fah hurt.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.229
Deal with your dad first.

00:14:18.585 --> 00:14:22.242
The only reason is he’s afraid you’ll tell people you’re someone else’s kid and he’ll lose face.

00:14:22.601 --> 00:14:24.402
That’s totally his own fault anyway.

00:14:24.771 --> 00:14:26.589
Why the hell did he do that in the first place?

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.540
Want me to talk to him for you?

00:14:29.198 --> 00:14:30.580
Forget about that for now.

00:14:30.902 --> 00:14:36.454
Yeah, and don’t overthink it. Try following your own feelings sometimes. It’s your life.

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.350
Mm.

00:14:50.167 --> 00:14:51.717
Where the hell did you find North from, dude?

00:14:53.277 --> 00:14:55.752
I just kicked some dirt and he popped up out of nowhere.

00:14:56.528 --> 00:14:57.887
What kind of creature is that?

00:14:58.157 --> 00:15:00.010
I just feel like—

00:15:00.905 --> 00:15:02.308
North has really positive energy.

00:15:02.637 --> 00:15:05.405
More like positive-negative energy, if you ask me.

00:15:05.884 --> 00:15:07.675
Yeah, yeah, I know.

00:15:09.314 --> 00:15:12.093
I wish I could be positive energy for P'Fah too.

00:15:13.148 --> 00:15:15.069
Even if I’m not as strong as North.

00:15:15.616 --> 00:15:18.001
Why do you have to be strong?

00:15:18.044 --> 00:15:20.927
Like I said, just being yourself is enough.

00:15:21.164 --> 00:15:23.671
Don’t try to be like North.

00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:29.801
So, your med school exam results are out, right? How was it?

00:15:33.681 --> 00:15:35.158
I didn’t make it.

00:15:41.525 --> 00:15:43.171
But I’d already prepared myself for that.

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:45.743
I guess I wasn’t ready this year.

00:15:46.299 --> 00:15:48.214
I’ll try again next year.

00:15:48.711 --> 00:15:50.121
So why do you want to be a doctor?

00:15:54.681 --> 00:15:56.045
I…

00:15:56.668 --> 00:15:58.582
I want to fulfill Fun’s dream.

00:16:03.548 --> 00:16:05.943
And what about your own dream?

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:28.580
I don’t know. I’ve never eaten myself before. But this box of chocolate is just the right amount of sweet. It’s really good. Thank you.

00:17:56.802 --> 00:17:58.041
Shit.

00:17:58.551 --> 00:17:59.477
Huh?

00:18:01.965 --> 00:18:02.964
Is it morning already?

00:18:03.663 --> 00:18:06.072
Look over there—it’s almost evening.

00:18:06.414 --> 00:18:08.401
I finished class and came back, and you’re still asleep.

00:18:09.134 --> 00:18:11.957
Shit—did you take attendance for me or not?

00:18:15.607 --> 00:18:18.638
Don’t worry, buddy. You’re getting expelled soon anyway.

00:18:18.845 --> 00:18:20.345
You bastard, Fah. Asshole.

00:18:23.496 --> 00:18:26.151
Ugh.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.530
- Got a headache?
- Like hell I do.

00:18:33.954 --> 00:18:36.905
There—I bought you food and some hangover meds.

00:18:37.355 --> 00:18:38.345
Eat up.

00:18:42.715 --> 00:18:45.320
Thanks, man. You’re a damn saint.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.034
Why’d you get wasted like this?

00:19:02.114 --> 00:19:05.954
Fah, what about the person who sent the letter?

00:19:06.505 --> 00:19:07.688
Did you open your heart to him yet?

00:19:10.146 --> 00:19:13.817
Yeah. I think he’s pretty cute.

00:19:15.075 --> 00:19:17.660
And honestly, I really like this kind of normalcy.

00:19:21.539 --> 00:19:22.327
Oops.

00:19:23.948 --> 00:19:25.028
The chocolate bill.

00:19:27.782 --> 00:19:30.189
- How much?
- 550.

00:19:30.714 --> 00:19:33.053
- Sounds fine. Not expensive.
- Dollars.

00:19:34.214 --> 00:19:35.185
Dollars?

00:19:35.528 --> 00:19:37.290
Yeah. Plus ten dollars for the carrying fee.

00:19:38.435 --> 00:19:41.179
- Hurry up and transfer it.
- Where the hell did you get it from?

00:19:41.814 --> 00:19:42.927
Don’t ask.

00:19:43.093 --> 00:19:44.755
- Eighteen grand, right?
- Twenty. Transfer it.

00:19:44.862 --> 00:19:45.745
Mm.

00:19:46.642 --> 00:19:47.625
Transferred.

00:19:49.721 --> 00:19:52.343
Just you opening your heart already cost 500 dollars.

00:19:53.851 --> 00:19:56.002
All my friends are freaking sugar daddies.

00:19:57.143 --> 00:19:59.401
Says the guy—aren’t you one too?

00:19:59.804 --> 00:20:02.691
No way. I’m not letting anyone leech off my money.

00:20:03.068 --> 00:20:04.791
Love is such bullshit.

00:20:05.244 --> 00:20:09.334
Hurry up and eat. And if you’re leaving, lock the room for me.

00:20:09.911 --> 00:20:11.148
I’m going back to studying.

00:20:14.991 --> 00:20:15.869
Clean up too.

00:20:16.394 --> 00:20:17.176
Mm.

00:20:30.708 --> 00:20:32.435
Fah, can I borrow a shirt?

00:20:32.831 --> 00:20:33.580
Mm.

00:21:01.511 --> 00:21:03.057
Why the hell are you reading so much, Fah?

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:05.533
I’m summarizing what we learned today.

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.342
You skipped class—you should review too.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.860
Of course I am.
Aren’t you tired?

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:13.000
Of course I am.

00:21:15.703 --> 00:21:17.068
Being Tonfah is exhausting, huh?

00:21:20.228 --> 00:21:22.583
Yeah, being Tonfah is exhausting as hell.

00:21:22.899 --> 00:21:24.143
Then is being Arthit exhausting?

00:21:24.945 --> 00:21:25.900
Me?

00:21:27.072 --> 00:21:29.074
It’s fucking brutal.

00:21:29.817 --> 00:21:31.001
What’s brutal?

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:33.423
Everything.

00:21:36.528 --> 00:21:37.631
Hey, Fah.

00:21:37.774 --> 00:21:38.161
Yeah?

00:21:38.349 --> 00:21:44.146
Remember when Hill said if he combined you and me—

00:21:44.628 --> 00:21:47.103
he’d get one perfect person?

00:21:47.568 --> 00:21:48.671
Mm.

00:21:50.844 --> 00:21:54.331
But honestly, I don’t want to be combined with you.

00:21:55.291 --> 00:21:57.207
I’m just comparing, asshole.

00:21:58.665 --> 00:22:00.237
I don’t want to be combined with you either.

00:22:00.297 --> 00:22:01.071
Oh please.

00:22:08.477 --> 00:22:09.816
Haven’t you stopped yet?

00:22:10.168 --> 00:22:11.782
That habit of pressuring yourself.

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:17.117
Yeah.

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:29.640
If anything’s wrong, you can tell me, Fah.

00:22:34.241 --> 00:22:35.774
Just tell me, Fah.

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.260
I want to stick my nose into your business.

00:22:45.859 --> 00:22:47.725
I just don’t want to disappoint anyone.

00:22:49.583 --> 00:22:50.902
My dad…

00:22:51.634 --> 00:22:53.777
He wants me to be the sky that stands higher than everyone else.

00:22:54.474 --> 00:22:55.411
For my mom,

00:22:56.408 --> 00:23:00.165
she wanted me to be like a tree others could lean on.

00:23:01.294 --> 00:23:02.727
So I became Tonfah.

00:23:05.591 --> 00:23:07.814
By the way, why is your name Arthit?

00:23:08.997 --> 00:23:10.280
I was born on a Sunday.

00:23:10.866 --> 00:23:11.764
Pretty simple, right?

00:23:12.105 --> 00:23:14.740
Yeah, life doesn’t have to be that complicated, Fah.

00:23:17.785 --> 00:23:18.709
Well,

00:23:19.632 --> 00:23:21.321
both my parents are doctors.

00:23:21.752 --> 00:23:24.574
They’re kind and warm.

00:23:25.573 --> 00:23:27.294
And they really care about people around them.

00:23:28.195 --> 00:23:31.568
You know, they barely ever had to force me to do anything.

00:23:32.437 --> 00:23:33.982
I just grew up becoming like them.

00:23:35.268 --> 00:23:40.466
So I guess I got used to always checking if other people are okay.

00:23:41.842 --> 00:23:43.094
Like,

00:23:44.192 --> 00:23:45.856
can’t you just not care for once?

00:23:48.853 --> 00:23:50.733
I’ve tried, you know.

00:23:51.044 --> 00:23:54.244
But I tend to live up to other people’s expectations.

00:23:57.037 --> 00:23:58.208
Until sometimes

00:23:58.874 --> 00:24:00.362
I don’t even know

00:24:01.336 --> 00:24:02.925
what kind of person I want to be.

00:24:04.819 --> 00:24:06.471
So… are you happy now?

00:24:12.531 --> 00:24:13.259
Yeah.

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:15.700
See? You right there.

00:24:15.974 --> 00:24:17.259
Some people

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.228
don’t even know what the hell they were born for.

00:24:20.914 --> 00:24:22.026
Like me.

00:24:23.684 --> 00:24:25.376
When I tell you to be yourself,

00:24:26.121 --> 00:24:29.911
I don’t mean you have to be different or live just for yourself.

00:24:31.626 --> 00:24:35.851
For some people, just caring about others is enough.

00:24:36.536 --> 00:24:38.958
Damn, when you get serious,

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.275
you actually sound pretty thoughtful.

00:24:43.195 --> 00:24:44.017
Well,

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:48.754
I’m the serious type—just not very expressive.

00:24:50.348 --> 00:24:51.290
What does that even mean?

00:24:51.722 --> 00:24:54.320
What I’m saying is,

00:24:54.509 --> 00:24:57.285
as long as you’re living your life happily, that’s enough.

00:24:57.401 --> 00:24:58.057
Uh…

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:01.408
If you’re tired, take a break. You don’t always have to study.

00:25:01.705 --> 00:25:03.294
Studying doesn’t automatically make you smarter anyway.

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:06.592
Or you could just not give a damn like me.

00:25:07.579 --> 00:25:08.656
Uh…

00:25:09.379 --> 00:25:12.177
I’m off. See you.

00:25:12.469 --> 00:25:14.472
Thanks, man.

00:25:31.588 --> 00:25:32.977
So what’s your conclusion, exactly?

00:25:34.762 --> 00:25:36.527
Eighteen thousand baht chocolate.

00:25:37.998 --> 00:25:40.277
If Johan bought it, I wouldn’t even be surprised.

00:25:40.299 --> 00:25:41.368
But when it’s you…

00:25:42.601 --> 00:25:43.494
Yeah.

00:25:43.961 --> 00:25:45.838
I just wanted to buy it.

00:25:46.099 --> 00:25:46.979
That’s all.

00:25:47.352 --> 00:25:49.711
If he said he doesn’t like it, then he doesn’t like it.

00:25:49.915 --> 00:25:52.847
French chocolate. It’s just a kind gesture.

00:25:52.877 --> 00:25:55.096
Your “kind gesture” is seriously over the top.

00:25:55.948 --> 00:25:58.822
Honestly, is it really that weird? It’s just chocolate.

00:25:59.248 --> 00:26:01.189
Not weird. Totally normal.

00:26:02.576 --> 00:26:04.117
If it is for someone you like.

00:26:08.125 --> 00:26:10.459
So what is it, huh, Fah?

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:12.551
Well…

00:26:13.791 --> 00:26:15.317
I like him. So what?

00:26:19.234 --> 00:26:20.188
How much do you like him?

00:26:23.325 --> 00:26:25.546
I don’t know. I just do.

00:26:25.914 --> 00:26:28.496
I don’t know how to measure how much.

00:26:30.229 --> 00:26:33.422
Is it even possible to like someone you’ve never met?

00:26:34.434 --> 00:26:36.108
I guess that part doesn’t really matter to me.

00:26:36.468 --> 00:26:37.845
Just that he’s him.

00:26:38.967 --> 00:26:40.346
The person in the letters.

00:26:41.718 --> 00:26:43.157
That is enough for me.

00:26:47.595 --> 00:26:51.760
Come to think of it, nothing about you two is really stable.

00:26:52.402 --> 00:26:56.145
If he disappears, he could disappear just like that.

00:26:57.416 --> 00:27:03.189
And if one day he realizes someone close by is more real than a person in letters,

00:27:03.678 --> 00:27:07.441
he could disappear, and you wouldn’t even have the right to chase after him.

00:27:10.595 --> 00:27:14.013
After all this, you’re really okay with letting things stay like this?

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:24.192
Fah.

00:27:25.333 --> 00:27:26.487
I’m hungry.

00:27:28.312 --> 00:27:30.405
- Is something wrong?
- Someone asked me to give this to you.

00:27:32.054 --> 00:27:33.103
Who’s it from?

00:27:33.383 --> 00:27:38.060
It’s from my friend. He asked me not to say his name, but he said enjoy your meal.

00:27:38.358 --> 00:27:39.240
I see.

00:27:39.635 --> 00:27:41.955
I really can’t accept it. Please tell him I’m sorry.

00:27:42.561 --> 00:27:44.816
Please take it. My friend really likes you.

00:27:45.235 --> 00:27:47.774
I really can’t. I’m sorry.

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:50.890
I understand.

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:57.161
Fah, what’s wrong with you? You usually accept stuff from people, don’t you?

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.767
Didn’t you say if someone gives you something, you should accept it?

00:28:00.062 --> 00:28:01.017
It’s rude not to.

00:28:01.207 --> 00:28:02.708
That was when I already had someone in my heart.

00:28:03.352 --> 00:28:04.850
How could I just accept things from anyone?

00:28:05.265 --> 00:28:06.216
Right?

00:28:06.666 --> 00:28:07.337
Yeah.

00:28:14.468 --> 00:28:17.259
Fah, couldn’t you take it? What if it’s food?

00:28:17.272 --> 00:28:19.028
Where did you crawl out from, starving like that?

00:28:19.552 --> 00:28:21.128
I’m not asking for your stuff. I’m asking for his.

00:28:21.177 --> 00:28:23.647
- It’s his, you know that, right?
- I’m just hungry.

00:28:24.434 --> 00:28:26.711
Yeah, I was about to head over anyway.

00:28:28.444 --> 00:28:30.346
Huh? What?

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.383
A car accident?

00:28:32.598 --> 00:28:38.960
Yeah. I’m in a cast, stuck in my room. Probably won’t be going to uni for a while. Sorry.

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:41.429
Looks like I won’t be able to deliver it to P'Tonfah.

00:28:41.637 --> 00:28:44.305
Then what about my gift— hey, wait.

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:46.290
Cupid’s out of action.

00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:48.330
He can’t carry out the mission.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:49.780
What are we gonna do?

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.280
Isn’t there anyone else to replace him?

00:28:58.790 --> 00:28:59.810
Why are you acting like that?

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:02.960
You think it’s that easy to find someone?

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:06.110
It took forever to find someone suitable for this huge mission.

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:07.580
And negotiating everything took time too.

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:12.420
- You think just anyone will do?
- I know, okay? I’m stressed out too.

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:18.840
- Phoon.
- Hmm?

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:21.080
What if we use this chance to test P'Fah?

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:24.700
If P'Fah doesn’t get anything from you and starts getting anxious,

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.410
that’s actually a good thing.

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.850
Uh…

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:30.220
But I don’t want to test P'Fah.

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:33.640
Then what are we supposed to do? Wait until Bobby’s leg heals?

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:35.110
That’ll take forever.

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:38.850
I think we need to change the plan.

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:42.010
How about setting a place and taking turns exchanging the items?

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.130
Huh? What if you accidentally run into each other?

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:49.960
If P'Fah and the maew agree on the timing,

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:51.630
you guys probably won’t meet.

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:53.820
But if I were P'Fah,

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:57.220
I’d wanna secretly check who the other person is.

00:29:57.790 --> 00:29:58.660
Mm.

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:00.740
I don’t think P'Fah would do that, one hundred percent.

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:03.980
If he really wanted to know, he would’ve asked ages ago.

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:06.960
He really respects the person in the letters.

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:10.900
Still, this method sounds okay.

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:13.100
But wouldn’t that bother him?

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:17.160
Come on, we’re already this far. Toughen up.

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:20.040
Don’t give up yet.

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:23.620
I think that Dao's plan actually works.

00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:26.980
If you’re worried about P'Fah, just meet him in the medical building.

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:28.500
Any coffee shop will do.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:29.830
That way it’s convenient for P'Fah.

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:31.180
Right?

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:33.410
But coffee shops are always crowded.

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:39.240
What’s with you now?

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:43.350
I’m telling you, I’ve found a new Cupid for you guys.

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:46.730
Who?

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:48.320
Yeah, who?

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.400
Are you serious?

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:56.240
Yeah.

00:30:57.770 --> 00:30:59.410
Would this bother you, P'Gib?

00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:02.230
Not at all. I’m in.

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.680
Sounds fun.

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:05.780
I’ve never done anything like this before.

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:08.390
North.

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:10.280
Do you seriously know everyone on campus?

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:12.680
See? I told you to trust me.

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:16.890
Fah comes to my café every morning anyway.

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:18.410
It fits our plan perfectly.

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:20.110
I’ll tell you guys this.

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.060
P'Gib is beautiful and rich,

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:27.580
great at making coffee—and most importantly, great at planning.

00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:34.000
Wow, I can’t tell if you’re genuinely praising me or just want a discount coupon.

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:36.120
Probably the latter.

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:37.430
I mean it.

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:40.150
- But a coupon would be nice.
- See?

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:41.910
I knew it—that’s just like you.

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:51.370
Hey, North. That’s my cup. Yours is over there.

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:53.030
- I’m just tasting it.
- Then why didn’t you order cocoa?

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:55.120
- I can’t even taste it?
- No, I’m stingy.

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.350
What if P'Hill and P'Fah don’t show up?

00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:58.910
Are we just leaving it to fate?

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:00.850
Even if P'Fah doesn’t come tomorrow,

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:02.160
he’ll come another day.

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:04.640
I don’t think P'Fah would stop drinking coffee here.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:05.950
Because P'Gib pours too little.

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:09.520
Maybe I shouldn’t treat you to cake anymore.

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:11.110
I was just about to treat you.

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:14.130
- I’m not involved, okay?
- I’m just joking, P'Gib.

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:17.210
I told you not to get too close to Arthit.

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:20.400
At first, you were really cute.

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:21.780
That’s true.

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:23.680
This is all P'Arthit’s fault.

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:26.250
For staining someone pure and innocent like me.

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:27.610
How can you even say that, North?

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:30.940
You? I’ve only ever seen you decent when P'Johan was around.

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:32.740
Other than that—you’re a mess!

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:36.580
Let me tell you—“pure,” my ass. More like filthy already.

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:38.510
I’ll be the one to make you even dirtier.

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:41.440
Just wait till I need to take a dump first.

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:46.650
Whoa—are you okay?

00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:47.700
I’m fine.

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:55.120
I’m sorry I couldn’t contact you for several days.
The person who was supposed to pass the item on was unavailable.

00:32:55.157 --> 00:33:02.857
So I asked P'Gib for a favor.
Would it be too much trouble to ask you to pick it up here every morning?

00:33:02.872 --> 00:33:04.777
If it’s inconvenient, that’s totally fine.

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:08.822
The weather’s been changing lately. Please take care of your health.

00:33:08.826 --> 00:33:11.431
I feel like I might be getting sick myself.

00:33:11.644 --> 00:33:15.607
I already ordered hot coffee for you. Don’t order another one—one cup is enough.

00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:19.570
- Here you go, Fah. Your hot coffee.
- Thank you.

00:33:22.077 --> 00:33:24.170
- Uh, Mhor.
- Yes?

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:26.020
Do you want to look for him?

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:28.960
I don’t think that’s a good idea.

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:35.520
That’s good. If you got curious and started pressing me for answers,

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.430
I’d be in a really awkward position.

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:40.480
But—

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:42.490
I’ll give you a tiny spoiler, then.

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.160
What is it?

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:48.870
He is…

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:51.240
a really lovely person.

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:56.290
If about that, I already know.

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:01.350
What should I do next? Guess I’ll make more coffee.

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.780
Where did he disappear to? He told me to buy it and then didn’t show up.

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:08.170
He said he went to the drugstore.

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:09.440
Who’s sick?

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:14.866
Oh—then if he’s not coming, I’ll eat first. I can’t wait anymore. Oops.

00:34:15.315 --> 00:34:16.964
That’s mine.

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:21.060
You weren’t here yet. I was afraid it’d get cold.

00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:23.200
So I was gonna eat it for you—that’s all.

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:26.020
So what’s the conclusion—are we gonna lie in wait?

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.050
Nope.

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.570
Don’t you want to know who they are?

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:35.330
They clearly don’t want me to know.

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:38.150
Shouldn’t I think about his comfort first?

00:34:42.410 --> 00:34:43.680
Then what’s that?

00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:45.460
Oh, he's not feeling well.

00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:46.950
Oh.

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:03.330
You came so late—I’m about to close the shop already.

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.220
Here you go.

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:17.850
Phoon.

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:19.990
Are you sick?

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:22.140
Just a little.

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:27.120
Don’t worry about others so much that you forget to take care of yourself.

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:29.530
Thank you.

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:34.660
Should you see a doctor?

00:35:52.106 --> 00:35:55.693
To the patient: I’m not sure if you’re feeling better yet,

00:35:56.008 --> 00:35:59.422
but please monitor your symptoms and take the medicine as instructed.

00:36:00.054 --> 00:36:05.131
P.S. Don’t worry. I already asked my aunt, who’s a pharmacist, for advice.

00:36:05.475 --> 00:36:08.300
If you’re not getting better, please see a doctor.

00:36:09.023 --> 00:36:12.185
If there’s an emergency, you can call me at this number.

00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:25.281
- Saline for nasal rinsing
- Oral rehydration salts: 1 sachet in 600 ml, sip gradually
- Cooling gel patch until body temperature goes down
- Throat lozenges: 1 piece at a time

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:43.520
Hello, Foam. Where are you now?

00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:48.463
Oh wow, didn’t you say you were sick?
You sound so cheerful—are you better already?

00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:51.280
I got good medicine.

00:36:51.909 --> 00:36:52.914
What kind of medicine?

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:55.380
Not telling.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.210
Hold on a sec—there’s another call coming in.

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:03.540
Hello?

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:07.510
Sorry, is this Typhoon’s number?

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:10.420
Yes, it is.

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:11.960
Who is this?

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:25.610
Typhoon, dear.

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:30.860
I’m sorry if this makes you uncomfortable.

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:33.610
I’m okay.

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:38.530
Did you come to Chiang Mai with my dad?

00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:42.690
I heard he has clients here,

00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:44.840
so he comes often.

00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:48.720
No. I came here to see you, Typhoon.

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:54.580
Is there something you want to talk to me about?

00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:57.540
You’ve always known, right,

00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:59.410
that your father remarried me?

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:05.990
Yes.

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:11.190
But he never told me that he already had a family before.

00:38:12.970 --> 00:38:14.740
I only found out recently.

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:20.840
You’re not okay with the fact that he had a family before, are you?

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:23.690
That he already had a family.

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:25.700
I’m okay—

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:30.060
if he hadn’t lied and abandoned his own child like this.

00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:32.430
P'Rit.

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:35.190
Did he ever take care of you?

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:51.560
I caught him cheating.

00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:57.890
I’m sorry.

00:38:58.440 --> 00:38:59.960
I ended up crying in front of you.

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:04.650
It’s okay.

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:06.810
So I hired someone to investigate him,

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.330
and that’s how I found out—

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:12.560
not only did he have an affair,

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:15.050
he also had a family before,

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.790
and another son as well.

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.950
I’m in the middle of deciding

00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:24.410
the most important decision of my life.

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:30.660
I just want to know if he can be a good father to my child.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.420
I don’t know

00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:39.120
whether my dad can be a good father to your child,

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:41.890
but for me,

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:43.830
he never managed to be one.

00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:49.780
I understand.

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.190
Her name is Fai.

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:10.080
Fai.

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:16.020
P'Phoon’s little sister.

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:17.290
Hello.

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:21.890
My half-sister’s name is Fun.

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.980
Really? What a coincidence.

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:28.020
I named her “Phafai”

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:30.350
to match my own name, Phaphrae.

00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:33.730
Phafai? That’s such a cute name.

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:35.770
Thank you.

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:38.490
Then where is Fun?

00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:45.360
Fun passed away.

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:48.880
I’m sorry.

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:54.720
It’s okay.

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:58.260
Even though it’s sad that I’ll never see her again,

00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:00.520
thinking about Fun

00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:02.370
isn’t a bad thing at all.

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:07.840
You and Fun must have loved each other very much.

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:14.100
I did terrible things to Fun before she died.

00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:17.140
I didn’t even get the chance to apologize.

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:21.500
So now, I atone for my mistakes by

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:23.970
living my life for Fun.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.330
I believe your sister would rather want you to live your life for yourself.

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:32.660
I’ll get going now.

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:34.960
If anything happens, you can call me anytime.

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.380
Thank you very much.

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:37.440
Let’s go.

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:50.850
Living my life for myself… what does that even mean, Fun?

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:08.140
I believe your sister would rather want you to live your life for yourself.

00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:11.050
And what about your dream?

00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:14.730
What faculty are you studying in?

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:16.700
Veterinary Medicine.

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:21.110
P'Fah thought Phoon wouldn’t like this field.

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:38.430
Your peach tea is ready.

00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:42.700
This one’s on the house. Fah treated you.

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:45.830
He left plenty of money too. Want anything else?

00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:52.850
Mind if I sit here?

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:54.550
Oh… sure.

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:04.070
Phoon, do you really not want Fah to know that you’re the one from the letters?

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:06.720
Not really.

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:12.540
I don’t know… I think a relationship where one person knows everything

00:43:12.730 --> 00:43:14.200
while the other knows nothing at all

00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:16.340
is kind of sad.

00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:20.520
Fah seems to like you this much.

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:23.350
How do you think he’d feel

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:25.940
not knowing anything about the person he likes?

00:43:32.290 --> 00:43:34.940
Sorry, I was just rambling.

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:38.410
Uh, I’ll go get back to work then.

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.630
You can drink it now.

00:43:44.851 --> 00:43:47.632
I just made an important decision in my life.

00:43:47.687 --> 00:43:53.991
I can’t say what it is,
but thinking of you gave me more courage.

00:43:54.490 --> 00:43:57.517
So I just wanted to say thank you.
Thank you so much.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:05.025
I don’t know what good news you have, but congratulations.

00:44:05.041 --> 00:44:07.331
Please consider this a congratulatory gift from me.

00:44:31.225 --> 00:44:33.200
Phoon, is tomorrow P'Fah’s birthday?

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:35.259
How did you know?

00:44:37.382 --> 00:44:43.200
P'Hill took me to pick out a gift for P'Fah.
Why don’t you make use of this chance too?

00:44:43.558 --> 00:44:45.866
I already prepared a birthday gift for P'Fah.

00:44:48.088 --> 00:44:50.408
From Typhoon, or from the person in the letters?

00:44:53.997 --> 00:44:54.982
Both.

00:45:43.085 --> 00:45:46.810
The shirt’s really nice, but it’s too loose. I can’t wear it out.

00:45:47.087 --> 00:45:50.521
Sorry. I probably should’ve drunk more milk when I was a kid.

00:45:50.706 --> 00:45:53.320
But I really like it. I’ll wear it to sleep.

00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:56.940
You’re so kind. Thank you very much.

00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:22.680
Here—happy birthday.

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:24.060
Thanks.

00:46:24.616 --> 00:46:26.980
- This is from me and Ter together.
- Thank you very much.

00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:44.190
Happy birthday.

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:47.010
Thank you.

00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:53.600
I’m going to the restroom.

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:09.650
Damn it, Fah. It’s your birthday,
and instead of a bar,

00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:11.670
you dragged me here to tutor.

00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:13.380
Here.

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:14.930
Thanks.

00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:17.280
But you don’t have to next time.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:19.750
Here.

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:22.920
Happy Birthday P'Fah.

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:24.040
Thank you.

00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:53.310
Help! Help!

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:55.030
Someone’s stuck in here!

00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:04.730
P'Fah, help Phoon. I’m scared.

00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:06.910
P'Fah!

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:11.410
P'Fah, help Phoon. I’m scared.

00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:13.700
P'Fah!

00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:18.920
P'Fah, help Phoon. I’m scared.

00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:21.120
Phoon.

00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:32.130
Phoon, step back from the door first.

00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:47.530
P'Fah, I’m sorry. I did something wrong.

00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:49.930
Are you mad at me, P'Fah?

00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:51.860
It’s okay now.

00:48:52.410 --> 00:48:54.400
P'Fah is right here.

00:48:57.460 --> 00:48:58.820
I’m right here.

00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:04.070
Are you mad at me, P'Fah? Please don’t be mad at me.

00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:06.800
Calm down first, okay? You’re safe now.

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:09.470
Calm down.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000
I’m scared.

00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:40.090
P'Fah, I’m sorry. I did something wrong.

00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:57.320
I used to think of Phoon as just a younger brother.

00:50:58.010 --> 00:50:59.820
The kid next door I wanted to take the best care of.

00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:03.090
But you know he doesn’t see you as just a brother, right?

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:06.160
With P'Fah… it probably won’t stay the same anymore.

00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:11.270
So are you going to tell P'Fah about P'Fun?

00:51:11.550 --> 00:51:13.560
I think P'Fah is head over heels for you too.

00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:15.720
Whatever you say, he’ll go along with it.

00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:19.370
Has anyone ever told you how adorable you are?

00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:21.950
I really like your soft lips

00:51:22.610 --> 00:51:23.810
when I kiss you.
