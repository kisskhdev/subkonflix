[in Italian] Don't let her back in.

00:21:22.458 --> 00:21:24.958
[in English] How am I supposed
to get home?

00:21:25.041 --> 00:21:26.416
[James] You can keep the change.

00:21:27.541 --> 00:21:28.750
How dare you?

00:21:29.875 --> 00:21:32.375
Fuck you! Fuck you!

00:21:33.041 --> 00:21:34.166
My shoes. My shoes...

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:35.333
I hate you!

00:21:41.958 --> 00:21:43.458
[phone chimes]

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:32.083
So sweet.

00:22:38.541 --> 00:22:39.833
Narcissist.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:46.125
[June] Oh God, he's hot.

00:22:47.333 --> 00:22:48.500
Jeez.

00:22:51.041 --> 00:22:52.250
Enjoying yourself?

00:22:52.333 --> 00:22:53.416
[squeals]

00:22:54.583 --> 00:22:56.208
[penguin squeaks]

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.083
[June moans, kisses and mumbles]

00:23:02.166 --> 00:23:03.541
You should...

00:23:05.083 --> 00:23:06.916
Does the pillow have a name?

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.083
[squeals]

00:23:12.583 --> 00:23:13.791
What time is it?

00:23:14.375 --> 00:23:15.666
Almost ten.

00:23:15.958 --> 00:23:17.458
[sighs] Coffee?

00:23:17.541 --> 00:23:18.750
Ta-da!

00:23:19.875 --> 00:23:21.416
Best mummy ever.

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:24.958
-I don't know about that, but...
-Oh, sleepy.

00:23:25.041 --> 00:23:28.416
No, no, don't go back to sleep.
I want to know how your first day was.

00:23:29.166 --> 00:23:30.583
How are your classes?

00:23:30.666 --> 00:23:33.291
Who's your new friend
who lent you a 3,000-pound dress?

00:23:33.375 --> 00:23:36.458
And why do you have
a pile of boys' clothes?

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.541
Not to mention, who is that mysterious
pillow you're snogging with?

00:23:41.625 --> 00:23:42.875
Nighty night.

00:23:43.333 --> 00:23:46.000
[yells] You little shit!
You've got to tell me everything!

00:23:46.083 --> 00:23:48.041
-Everything!
-Okay, okay.

00:23:48.125 --> 00:23:49.416
[grunts]

00:23:49.958 --> 00:23:51.583
[sighs] I'm up.

00:23:58.125 --> 00:24:00.333
You know, it's his birthday next Tuesday.

00:24:07.125 --> 00:24:09.125
Isn't this supposed to get easier?

00:24:12.166 --> 00:24:13.208
It doesn't.

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:19.166
Right, I better get back to work.

00:24:24.291 --> 00:24:25.625
[sighs]

00:24:38.166 --> 00:24:41.541
Trophy, little trophy.
Trophy, little trophy...

00:24:41.625 --> 00:24:42.833
[June] Ow!

00:24:42.916 --> 00:24:44.583
[June] Mum, August hit me!

00:24:45.333 --> 00:24:47.166
[August] She's being annoying.

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:51.333
[June] My name is August White
and I'm so cool.

00:24:51.416 --> 00:24:56.291
-All the ladies love me.
-You are the definition of annoying.

00:24:56.375 --> 00:24:59.833
[June's indistinct noises]

00:24:59.916 --> 00:25:02.083
[June] You're future is bright,
my brother.

00:25:03.541 --> 00:25:06.375
-[Will] This is Gae Aulenti.
-[June] "Gao Lenti".

00:25:06.458 --> 00:25:09.250
-[Will] Gae Aulenti.
-[June] "Gao... Gao Aulenti".

00:25:09.333 --> 00:25:11.500
-[June laughs]
-Yeah, more or less.

00:25:11.916 --> 00:25:14.291
And you lived in Gae Aulenti
your whole life?

00:25:14.375 --> 00:25:15.416
Yeah.

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:17.875
But you moved around a lot.

00:25:18.875 --> 00:25:22.000
Milan makes it... seven.

00:25:22.458 --> 00:25:23.416
No, wait, eight.

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:24.625
-Eight?
-Yeah.

00:25:24.708 --> 00:25:25.958
And all new schools?

00:25:26.541 --> 00:25:31.208
[Will] I travelled for MMA fighting,
but I'm a lover, not a fighter.

00:25:31.291 --> 00:25:32.875
What do you like to do?

00:25:32.958 --> 00:25:36.833
I like to read thrillers
and watch true crime TV.

00:25:37.833 --> 00:25:40.125
I guess the dark turns me on.

00:25:41.166 --> 00:25:42.583
And do you also write?

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:46.291
No, I journal, but it's an outlet.

00:25:46.875 --> 00:25:49.875
I write occasionally... about my moods.

00:25:49.958 --> 00:25:53.166
-You don't strike me as moody.
-Good, I fooled you.

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:54.416
[chuckles]

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.708
[Will's phone rings]

00:25:59.291 --> 00:26:01.416
James Hunter. Bleah.

00:26:03.041 --> 00:26:05.125
One second, just one.

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:08.416
Hey, man. Can I call you back?

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.250
I'm just out with... my mum. Yeah.

00:26:12.208 --> 00:26:15.083
-[inaudible] "Mum"?
-[Will] I'll tell her you say hi, yes.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:17.666
[Will] Done.

00:26:19.833 --> 00:26:21.166
Are you okay?

00:26:22.333 --> 00:26:25.958
Just curious why you told him
I was your mum.

00:26:26.625 --> 00:26:28.791
It's not worth getting into it with him.

00:26:28.875 --> 00:26:31.166
He's been my best friend
since we were kids and...

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:32.250
"Best friend"?

00:26:33.208 --> 00:26:34.750
Will, he's awful.

00:26:35.458 --> 00:26:38.458
-He makes a bad first impression.
-First, second...

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:41.166
Third...
Yeah, they're all bad impressions.

00:26:41.666 --> 00:26:44.625
When we first met in elementary school,
I was afraid of James.

00:26:44.708 --> 00:26:47.041
I was shy and awkward.

00:26:47.791 --> 00:26:50.458
He wasn't scared of anyone,
and I wanted to be like him.

00:26:50.541 --> 00:26:51.375
Why?

00:26:51.458 --> 00:26:54.833
You don't know how many times
James has made me lose my temper.

00:26:55.375 --> 00:26:58.666
He does it with everybody, but then
he makes you fall in love with him.

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:01.041
Trust me, that would never happen.

00:27:14.416 --> 00:27:15.583
[June's phone chimes]

00:27:15.666 --> 00:27:17.875
-Did you like that?
-[June smiles timidly]

00:27:18.916 --> 00:27:20.833
-Oh, shit.
-What's wrong?

00:27:21.208 --> 00:27:23.833
Oh, I'm supposed
to be babysitting this...

00:27:24.375 --> 00:27:25.833
-I'll call you.
-Okay.

00:27:25.916 --> 00:27:27.666
-Thank you for the tour.
-Yeah.

00:27:28.333 --> 00:27:29.958
-And for the kiss.
-[chuckles]

00:27:30.041 --> 00:27:31.083

[in English] I'm so sorry I'm late.

It's okay.

-And this is Jasper.
-Hi, Jasper.

00:27:48.291 --> 00:27:51.166
Oh, thank you, Jasper.

00:27:53.875 --> 00:27:55.791
I should be back in about two hours.

00:27:55.875 --> 00:27:57.583
-Text me if you need me.
-Okay.

00:27:57.666 --> 00:27:59.500
-[in Italian] Bye.
-[in Italian] Bye.

00:28:02.208 --> 00:28:04.083
[June, in English] Have a nice time.

00:28:06.625 --> 00:28:10.208
So, Jasper, what would you like to do?
Do you want to play a game?

00:28:10.291 --> 00:28:11.458
MMA, yah!

00:28:11.541 --> 00:28:12.458
Ow!

[upbeat music playing]

What the fuck.

Jasper...

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:38.208
Bloody hell.

Jasper!

00:28:52.125 --> 00:28:54.000

-[shower water running]
-Jasper?

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.000
Is this another prank?

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:02.083
Okay...

00:29:02.333 --> 00:29:03.791
[both scream]

00:29:03.875 --> 00:29:05.000
-No!
-Ow!

-[in Spanish] Fuck!

00:29:08.041 --> 00:29:09.625
I live here, you imbecile!

00:29:09.708 --> 00:29:11.750
Jasper lives here.
This is Jasper's house.

00:29:11.833 --> 00:29:13.500
Yes, and he's my brother.

00:29:14.916 --> 00:29:16.333
God, this couldn't get any worse.

[clicks tongue] Snow White,
saying the Lord's name in vain again.

00:29:37.375 --> 00:29:39.291
All that over a naked boy.

00:29:40.708 --> 00:29:42.541
You must be quite repressed.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.916
I'm not repressed, I'm repulsed.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.208
Now get changed.

00:29:47.208 --> 00:29:48.625
Your wish is my command.

[balloon pops]

00:29:51.958 --> 00:29:53.500
I killed the bunny.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.125
You want to try?

00:29:56.416 --> 00:29:59.250
Do I want to pretend
to shoot defenceless animals?

00:29:59.333 --> 00:30:00.916
Well, they're balloon animals.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.125
Yeah, it doesn't matter.
The answer is no.

00:30:03.625 --> 00:30:06.041
Nor do I think
you should be teaching your brother.

00:30:06.125 --> 00:30:08.916
Well, if I don't teach him,
how's he going to learn?

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.958
What would you prefer, Snow White?

00:30:16.375 --> 00:30:17.958
Teach him how to sew?

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:19.583
Oh, good.

00:30:19.666 --> 00:30:23.583
I was wondering when you were going
to introduce sexism into the conversation.

Thank you.

00:30:40.291 --> 00:30:42.958
We've been busy trying to find
a special school for him.

00:30:43.041 --> 00:30:44.708
He won't go to St. Mary's?

00:30:44.791 --> 00:30:50.500
No, he has a mild form of autism
so that might not be the best fit.

00:30:50.583 --> 00:30:52.541
Where's his mum these days?

00:30:54.625 --> 00:30:56.458

[Jordan] No, not at all.

She had a breakdown over a year ago
and she is in rehab.

-I'm so sorry.
-No, no, no, please.

She and I have not been together
for years.

She has a new husband, but...

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.083
He's not a good man.

00:31:15.375 --> 00:31:16.208
Excuse me?

What gives you the right
to talk about my mother to some strangers?

00:31:20.166 --> 00:31:21.500
You know nothing about her

00:31:21.583 --> 00:31:24.000
and you're not exactly
the father of the year.

-Out.

[in Spanish] Stand up!

00:55:50.333 --> 00:55:53.375
[in English] My champion! James Hunter!

[crowd exults]

00:55:55.083 --> 00:55:57.291
Great, buddy. Great fight.

00:55:58.541 --> 00:55:59.666
What's up?

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.500
[throws up]

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.833
-I'm fine.
-You're not fine.

00:56:11.916 --> 00:56:14.708
You're having a reaction to the steroids.

00:56:14.791 --> 00:56:17.958
Let me guess, your body itches,
you're feeling nauseous.

00:56:18.416 --> 00:56:20.041
[coughs]
I feel...

00:56:20.875 --> 00:56:22.083
[throws up]

00:56:26.625 --> 00:56:28.500
-What are you, a doctor?
-Shut up.

00:56:29.958 --> 00:56:31.458
You're about one-eighty.

00:56:32.458 --> 00:56:34.041
-Is that good?
-No.

00:56:35.250 --> 00:56:37.875
Here, drink this.
You need the electrolytes.

00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:40.416
How could you know so much about this?

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.166
[June] My brother
was involved in steroids.

00:56:45.083 --> 00:56:47.916
-I didn't know you had a brother.
-Had.

00:56:49.333 --> 00:56:51.125
It's not something I like to talk about.

00:56:51.208 --> 00:56:54.375
-[Austin] Hey! Hey! How many times...
-He's having a reaction!

00:56:54.458 --> 00:56:57.375
To whatever you doped him up with.
What have you doped him up with?

00:56:57.458 --> 00:57:00.250
Is it Trenbolone Acetate
or Testosterone Cypionate?

00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:02.416
I don't know.

00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:04.791
You don't know!
How fucking stupid are you?

00:57:04.875 --> 00:57:06.333
What did you say? Say it again.

00:57:06.416 --> 00:57:09.375
-[James] Austin, chill.
-She can't fucking talk to me that way.

00:57:09.458 --> 00:57:12.083
-Give us a minute.
-I'm not going anywhere.

00:57:14.333 --> 00:57:15.458
Get out.

00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:17.375
Now.

00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:24.208
Alright, I'll go get the car.

00:57:28.541 --> 00:57:29.833
I don't like that guy.

00:57:31.291 --> 00:57:32.833
I think the feeling is mutual.

00:57:33.666 --> 00:57:35.125
You're lucky you're a girl.

00:57:35.416 --> 00:57:37.583
Oh. So, you think this is my fault?

00:57:38.291 --> 00:57:41.208
He should be apologising,
and you should be thanking me.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.375
It's not funny.

00:57:44.250 --> 00:57:46.458
This whole macho thing is bullshit.

00:57:46.541 --> 00:57:48.916
[techno music from the bunker]

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.000
What's that?

00:57:51.416 --> 00:57:52.583
It's the after party.

00:57:53.833 --> 00:57:54.666
[sighs]

00:57:54.750 --> 00:57:56.708
-[in Italian] Hi.
-[in Italian] Hi. Did you see June?

00:57:56.791 --> 00:57:58.666
[in English] No, not since the fight.

00:57:58.750 --> 00:57:59.875
-Okay.
-Bye.

00:58:02.208 --> 00:58:04.000
-[girl] Hey.
-[in Italian] Hi.

[Will's phone chimes]

00:58:27.416 --> 00:58:28.666
[Amelia, in English] Hi!

00:58:29.666 --> 00:58:32.583
Will, let's go to dance. Come on!

00:58:33.250 --> 00:58:34.625
I'll join you in a moment.

00:58:34.708 --> 00:58:36.916
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm okay. I'm okay.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:38.041
You sure?

00:58:38.375 --> 00:58:40.250
Alright. Oh, have you seen June?

00:58:40.916 --> 00:58:43.250
-No.
-Where did she go?

00:58:45.625 --> 00:58:46.875
Alright.
[kisses]

00:58:46.958 --> 00:58:49.041
Anyways... See you on the dance floor!

Fuck it.

00:59:33.541 --> 00:59:35.833
[James] Do you know what you're doing?

00:59:35.916 --> 00:59:38.083
[June] I've done this many times before.

00:59:40.291 --> 00:59:41.583
Ninety-five.

00:59:42.708 --> 00:59:45.375
It would be lower
if you weren't touching me that way.

00:59:46.291 --> 00:59:47.500
[June] I can stop.

00:59:51.541 --> 00:59:53.125
I don't want you to stop.

00:59:53.208 --> 00:59:56.000
[techno music plays]

[Will] Ari.

[heavy breathing]

01:00:50.208 --> 01:00:51.416
Are you okay?

01:00:52.166 --> 01:00:53.666
I'm fucking amazing.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.166
You're not drinking, are you?

What do you think, huh?

I don't know.

[Will] You taste so good.

-Will.
-You smell like chocolate.

No one wants me!

No one.

[clicks tongue] I don't.

This is wrong.

01:01:39.416 --> 01:01:41.083
What is it about you...

What is it about you?

[gasps from the bunker]

01:01:51.666 --> 01:01:52.708
[Jackson] Bro.

01:01:54.125 --> 01:01:55.375
We've got a problem.

01:01:56.625 --> 01:01:58.291
[James] Everyone, get out!

01:01:58.666 --> 01:02:02.250
[Jackson, in Italian] Did you hear?
Get out of the way. The party is over.

01:02:02.625 --> 01:02:04.791
[James, in Italian] Come on, go away!

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.541
[in English] You're okay, Will.

Fuck off!

01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:18.708
I'll follow you on his bike.
Let's get him home so he's safe.

01:02:18.791 --> 01:02:20.000
Okay, no worries.

01:02:21.041 --> 01:02:22.833
[James] Take my bike to your place.

01:02:22.916 --> 01:02:24.916
I'll pick it up
as soon as I drop him off.

-[June] Is he going to be okay?
-I'll explain later.

01:02:31.458 --> 01:02:32.583
I got you.

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:34.333
You're okay.

01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:58.791
You startled me.

What are you doing here?

01:03:00.583 --> 01:03:02.875
I need to talk to you about James.

Tell me what he told you about me.

Nothing.

You're his trainer.

I'm also his step-father.

01:03:13.208 --> 01:03:16.083
James is very, very important to me.

The last thing I need is for some cute
piece of ass to come between us.

Okay.

01:03:22.416 --> 01:03:26.333
Now I can see why the boys
are so enamoured with you.

01:03:26.958 --> 01:03:29.166
You're very, very pretty.

01:03:29.583 --> 01:03:31.208
May I come in for a moment?

01:03:32.291 --> 01:03:35.208
I don't think that's... My mum is asleep.

Your mum?

01:03:38.166 --> 01:03:40.833
I rang the doorbell, and no one answered.

01:03:41.541 --> 01:03:44.000
So, we are all alone.

01:03:52.125 --> 01:03:53.291
Oh...

01:03:54.416 --> 01:03:56.416
Shame on me.

this our little secret.

If I'm going to be your bodyguard,
I have to dress the part.

01:05:34.333 --> 01:05:37.041
You don't have to stay.
I can fend for myself.

Don't be stupid.

Are you going to tell me
what happened with Will tonight?

I don't think so.

Are you going to tell me
who threatened you?

01:05:54.958 --> 01:05:56.333
No one threatened me.

01:05:56.958 --> 01:05:58.250
Tell me what happened.

-You really do care about him, don't you?
-I care about a lot of things.

01:06:04.125 --> 01:06:06.166
Tell me what happened with him tonight.

01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:08.125
He's just going through some stuff.

[sighs] We're all going through stuff.

01:06:11.583 --> 01:06:13.500
What are you protecting him from?

01:06:16.208 --> 01:06:17.208
Himself.

01:06:20.125 --> 01:06:21.500
You know that girl, Ari?

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:24.750
-Yeah?
-Well, they used to be a thing.

01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:27.625
Pretty serious. Then shit happened.

01:06:28.458 --> 01:06:30.833
Will started getting too possessive and...

01:06:32.166 --> 01:06:33.791
And Ari just broke things off.

01:06:34.375 --> 01:06:35.541
He spiralled.

What do you mean, "spiralled"?

01:06:39.875 --> 01:06:41.041
Look, he's fine now.

01:06:41.125 --> 01:06:44.166
He has just to stay off things
that complicate his life.

01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:47.708
Things like me?

Something like that.

-Does he know that you are doing this?
-Hell no.

01:06:55.333 --> 01:06:57.166
Everything I do, I do for Will.

01:06:58.250 --> 01:06:59.333
For Will?

01:06:59.416 --> 01:07:00.708
Not for James?

01:07:01.333 --> 01:07:02.750
He's like a brother to me.

01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:04.541
I owe him my life.

-[chuckles] What are you doing?

[James] You liked cookies, huh?

01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:22.791
Yeah, I still do, I'll have you know.

01:07:24.375 --> 01:07:26.916
-I bet you were bossy.
-I was.

01:07:30.833 --> 01:07:32.125
Is this your brother?

01:07:33.083 --> 01:07:34.250
Yeah.

01:07:34.333 --> 01:07:35.916
How long ago...

01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:39.458
Almost two years now.

01:07:40.333 --> 01:07:43.291
[June] He was the one who taught me
how to ride a motorbike.
