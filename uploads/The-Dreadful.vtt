(metal clanging)

01:26.987 --> 01:31.192
(priest speaking in
foreign language)

01:46.574 --> 01:48.709
Thou art He that took me out

01:50.178 --> 01:51.712
of my mother's womb,

01:53.781 --> 01:56.417
my prayer shall
be always of thee.

01:59.687 --> 02:01.722
I am become, as it were,

02:03.524 --> 02:05.159
a monster unto many.

02:08.696 --> 02:09.997
But my sure faith

02:11.699 --> 02:16.003
and trust is in thee.

02:16.604 --> 02:20.007
(soft tense music)

02:25.579 --> 02:28.182
(communion host breaks)

02:52.840 --> 02:57.945
May God protect you
and your husbands in battle.

02:59.513 --> 03:04.485
- Beautiful sermon, how
he talked about new life.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.387
(soft chuckle)

03:06.487 --> 03:10.524
- Mistress May, what a
blessing to see you here,

03:10.624 --> 03:13.661
glowing like the Virgin
Mother herself. (chuckles)

03:13.761 --> 03:16.564
It brings such joy to my heart.

03:16.664 --> 03:21.335
Aw, may the Lord bring my Seamus
and your husband home soon.

03:21.435 --> 03:22.970
Mm-hmm.

03:23.036 --> 03:27.308
(bell tolling)
God is good.

03:27.375 --> 03:28.476
Thank you.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.415
Blessed day, Mistress.

03:37.685 --> 03:38.819
(chain clinking)

03:38.886 --> 03:40.654
[Anne] Won't she miss it?

03:40.721 --> 03:43.391
- She has plenty.
We have nothing.

03:48.962 --> 03:51.231
(birds chirping)
(eerie music)

03:54.668 --> 03:57.237
(Anne humming)

(brooding music)

04:09.850 --> 04:11.619
Come Anne.

04:11.719 --> 04:16.524
Whatcha looking at?
(brooding music continues)

04:26.934 --> 04:31.138
(pensive music)
(footsteps continue plodding)

(pensive music continues)

04:37.244 --> 04:39.880
(seeds rattling)

04:54.395 --> 04:59.266
(hair rustling)

05:14.281 --> 05:15.148
Oh.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.185
Oh.

05:25.793 --> 05:28.596
(water sloshing)

05:33.501 --> 05:36.437

(fire crackling)
(pensive music continues)

05:52.152 --> 05:53.954
(fire crackling)

05:54.021 --> 05:54.955
Mm, mm.

05:57.591 --> 06:02.362
(dish clanking)
(fire crackling)

06:03.764 --> 06:06.834
- (slurping)
- [Anne] Hmpf.

06:11.639 --> 06:14.408
(fire crackling)

06:15.709 --> 06:17.210
[Morwen] Hmm, mm.

06:20.448 --> 06:22.550
(soup sloshing)
(fire crackling)

06:22.650 --> 06:23.851
(Morwen exhales)

06:23.951 --> 06:28.422

(crickets chirping)

07:03.991 --> 07:05.425
(brooding music)

07:05.526 --> 07:07.995
- [children] <i>The fox fell out</i>
<i>on a chilly night.</i>

07:08.095 --> 07:11.131
<i>He prayed to the moon</i>
<i>to give him light.</i>

07:11.231 --> 07:14.334
<i>The fox and his wife</i>
<i>without any strife,</i>

07:14.434 --> 07:17.638
<i>cut up the goose with</i>
<i>a fork and knife.</i>

07:17.738 --> 07:19.907
<i>And the little</i>
<i>ones chewed on the bones,</i>

07:20.007 --> 07:22.109
<i>and bones, and bones.</i>

07:22.209 --> 07:23.544
(children laughing)

07:23.611 --> 07:28.048
(tender music)

07:32.352 --> 07:35.055
(waves lapping)

07:36.056 --> 07:37.257
- [child's voice]
Anne, come back.

07:38.726 --> 07:43.063
(dramatic music)

07:44.064 --> 07:46.834
(dramatic music)

07:48.301 --> 07:51.138
(crickets chirping)

07:54.107 --> 07:56.977
(plants rustling)

07:59.713 --> 08:02.683
- [Morwen] You have a way with
this stubborn ground.

08:02.783 --> 08:06.253
Oh, I could never get
anything to grow here.

08:08.421 --> 08:12.092
These beet roots will
be popular at market.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.661
We can barter them

08:15.262 --> 08:18.699
and this.
(chain clinking)

08:21.168 --> 08:22.670
Will you be selling that one?

08:22.770 --> 08:23.671
Aye.

08:25.238 --> 08:26.974
And we'll have bread
to eat tonight.

08:27.074 --> 08:30.678
(feet shuffling)
(Morwen exhales)

08:30.778 --> 08:31.679
Be safe.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.984
- My son chose well
when he picked a wife.

08:37.084 --> 08:38.385
You're my jewel.

08:38.485 --> 08:40.320
(Anne laughs)

08:40.420 --> 08:42.489
I'm always careful.
I know the roads.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.962
(eerie music)

08:50.831 --> 08:55.703
(leaves rustling)

09:02.776 --> 09:05.145
(Anne humming)

09:09.850 --> 09:10.550
[Seamus] <i>Anne?</i>

09:13.186 --> 09:15.255
(footsteps plodding)
(soft music)

09:15.355 --> 09:16.389
There you are.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.060
(wistful music)

09:20.160 --> 09:22.029
Seamus, you're back.

09:23.964 --> 09:25.666
I'm here, my love.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.668
(Anne laughs)

09:31.672 --> 09:34.207
(brooding music)

09:38.478 --> 09:40.080
(Seamus groaning)

09:42.683 --> 09:47.454
(Seamus screaming)
(brooding music continues)

09:50.557 --> 09:51.424
Help me.

09:53.393 --> 09:55.128
Pain.
(dramatic music)

09:55.228 --> 09:58.598
(Anne gasps and exhales)

10:06.573 --> 10:07.975
(Morwen chuckles)

10:08.075 --> 10:13.213
(pot clanking)

10:14.214 --> 10:15.215
- Is this all?
- Aye.

10:16.049 --> 10:16.917
Except...

10:21.855 --> 10:23.056
Oh, Morwen.

10:24.057 --> 10:26.426
(kissing)

10:26.526 --> 10:28.595
(vegetable thuds)
(Anne laughs)

10:28.696 --> 10:31.765
(knife rasping and thudding)

10:31.865 --> 10:33.233
(Anne exhales)

10:33.300 --> 10:34.301
(knife thuds)

10:34.401 --> 10:36.737
(grim music)

10:36.804 --> 10:37.671
Oh.

10:43.543 --> 10:44.644
(Morwen exhales)

10:44.745 --> 10:46.179
I...
(vegetable thuds)

10:46.279 --> 10:48.916
- Damn.
(dishes clanking)

10:53.553 --> 10:55.422
No matter. I don't mind.

10:57.124 --> 10:58.826
I've got my sweet Anne.

11:00.393 --> 11:03.096
Be patient. The
Virgin will provide.

11:04.564 --> 11:05.833
The Lady is merciful.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.467
She will to it that we have

11:07.567 --> 11:10.537
what we need to
fill our bellies.

11:10.637 --> 11:13.606
(fire crackling)

11:13.673 --> 11:17.778
- And I pray, too, that
Seamus will return soon.

11:17.845 --> 11:21.181
I thought he would be
here with us again by now.

11:21.281 --> 11:23.183
(Anne sighs)

11:23.283 --> 11:24.151
(pensive music)

11:24.251 --> 11:25.685
It's been so long.

11:27.620 --> 11:31.024
- He'll have to put an end
to this curse of poverty

11:31.124 --> 11:33.060
and become a wealthy man.

11:34.494 --> 11:38.799
Have faith in his
ambition. (laughs)

11:38.866 --> 11:41.001
This war will make us rich.

11:42.836 --> 11:47.140
I do.

11:53.346 --> 11:58.318
(waves lapping)
(birds squawking)

11:58.986 --> 12:01.321
(grass rustling)

12:04.191 --> 12:07.327
(man singing faintly)

12:11.698 --> 12:15.035
* <i>Aye, aye, this night is long</i> *

12:15.168 --> 12:18.839
* <i>I most unjustly</i> *

12:18.972 --> 12:22.175
* <i>Sorrow, and mourn, and fast</i> *

12:22.242 --> 12:23.944
(water pattering)
(waves lapping)

12:24.077 --> 12:26.914
* <i>Aye, this night is long *</i>

12:27.014 --> 12:29.850
* <i>I most unjustly</i> *
(bag rustling)

12:29.983 --> 12:34.287
(fish thuds)
* <i>Sorrow, and mourn, and fast</i> *

12:34.387 --> 12:36.857
(man singing faintly)
(pensive music)

12:36.924 --> 12:37.791
Jago.

12:39.559 --> 12:43.964
(waves lapping)
(pensive music continues)

12:48.435 --> 12:49.536
Hello, Anne.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.073
Back from Tewkesbury?

12:53.907 --> 12:54.774
I am.

12:57.244 --> 12:59.212
Are the wars over then?

13:01.781 --> 13:06.086
- Over for me.
(waves lapping)

13:06.186 --> 13:08.788
- Then it's good
to see you again.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.061
But where is my husband?

13:15.595 --> 13:19.766
(waves lapping)
(pensive music continues)

13:19.867 --> 13:24.671
(Jago slurping)
(soup sloshing)

13:40.220 --> 13:41.421
Where is my son?

13:45.725 --> 13:50.430
(Jago sucking fingers)
(fire crackling)

13:51.831 --> 13:53.300
Rivers of blood,

13:54.101 --> 13:56.303
(pensive music)

13:56.403 --> 13:57.270
bodies,

14:01.508 --> 14:06.279
his Lord's liberty
and maintenance, they all look the same,

14:08.081 --> 14:10.450
mangled and dirtied.

14:10.517 --> 14:13.653
(fire crackling)
(pensive music continues)

14:13.753 --> 14:16.456
Seamus and I, we,
we had to leave.

14:24.697 --> 14:25.966
You've known me.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.538
I'm a fisherman, not a soldier.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.477
What army does Richard have?

14:40.513 --> 14:42.315
Armies and fishermen
forced to square

14:42.382 --> 14:46.586
against some unknown man
at the other end of battle,

14:46.686 --> 14:49.356
and one of us'll kill the other,

14:51.358 --> 14:53.726
and it won't change anything.

14:55.462 --> 14:58.198
It won't cease the fighting,

14:58.298 --> 14:59.699
but the crown
would've lost a son

14:59.799 --> 15:02.002
who would've grown her
crops and fed her people

15:02.069 --> 15:05.238
if only she'd give him
a chance to come home.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.374
You abandoned your post.

15:08.341 --> 15:11.344
(pensive music continues)

15:11.411 --> 15:13.513
We agreed we would leave

15:15.748 --> 15:19.019
at night while the
captains were asleep.

15:21.054 --> 15:22.122
But we were,

15:25.592 --> 15:27.560
we were beset by thieves.

15:30.530 --> 15:31.531
They beat us,

15:33.933 --> 15:35.768
took what little we had.

15:41.341 --> 15:42.542
They killed Seamus

15:45.178 --> 15:46.046
nigh on.

15:51.384 --> 15:54.321
We should never have
left this place,

15:55.855 --> 15:59.993
this little cove.
(fire crackling)

16:01.428 --> 16:03.563
He was my dearest friend.

16:06.399 --> 16:07.834
You saw him die?

16:11.071 --> 16:11.738
Aye.

16:16.409 --> 16:20.913
- (exhales) How,
how did it happen?

16:20.980 --> 16:24.084
- Uh, it's too cruel for
a woman's ears, Morwen.

16:24.151 --> 16:26.986
- Oh, I'm no stranger
to cruelty, pup.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.689
My heart is already hard.

16:29.789 --> 16:31.691
They split him neck to navel.

16:31.791 --> 16:33.960
(Seamus screaming)
(blood squelching)

16:34.061 --> 16:35.995
(Anne whimpers)

16:36.096 --> 16:40.967
(pensive music)
(fire crackling)

16:50.277 --> 16:51.010
I am sorry.

16:52.479 --> 16:57.317
(fire crackling)
(somber music)

16:58.918 --> 17:02.455
(waves lapping)
(somber music continues)

17:05.192 --> 17:07.794
(Anne sobbing)

17:10.497 --> 17:11.631
Ah, Seamus.

17:15.468 --> 17:16.669
You were my heart.

17:21.441 --> 17:24.911
My chest is empty. (sobbing)

17:34.687 --> 17:38.525
(birds chirping)
(pensive music)

17:38.625 --> 17:41.361
(grass rustling)

17:59.045 --> 18:01.948
(Jago humming)

18:02.048 --> 18:06.886
(net rustling)
(Jago continues humming)

18:16.896 --> 18:19.699
(brooding music)

18:24.504 --> 18:29.309
(reins clattering)
(brooding music)

18:31.778 --> 18:35.482
(horse nickering)
(hoof thudding)

18:35.582 --> 18:38.551
(voices whispering)

18:45.124 --> 18:49.962
(Anne exhales)
(birds chirping)

18:50.897 --> 18:53.566
(pensive music)

18:59.306 --> 19:01.574
My son is not coming back,

19:07.046 --> 19:08.915
and you, left childless,

19:13.320 --> 19:16.956
a girl with no husband. (laughs)

19:19.326 --> 19:22.762
He's gone into dirt
with the rest of them.

19:24.997 --> 19:29.769
We're truly alone.
(pensive music continues)

19:31.304 --> 19:33.773
What, (sighs)

19:36.409 --> 19:38.445
what, what will we do now?

19:42.615 --> 19:45.184
(bag rustling)

19:46.185 --> 19:49.689
(Morwen exhales)

19:49.789 --> 19:52.158
I, I wanted to see him again.

19:57.930 --> 20:02.802
(clothes rustling)
(pensive music continues)

20:05.972 --> 20:08.375
(floor creaking)

20:08.475 --> 20:13.313
(grass rustling)
(pensive music continues)

20:24.324 --> 20:26.826
(waves lapping)

20:40.707 --> 20:45.545
(boat creaking)
(waves continue lapping)

20:50.249 --> 20:51.284
(dramatic music)

20:51.384 --> 20:56.255
(brooding music)

21:03.430 --> 21:05.865
(pensive music)

21:14.341 --> 21:19.145
(knife rasping)
(castaway grunting)

21:25.184 --> 21:30.056
(body thudding)
(birds chirping)

21:31.524 --> 21:32.892
It's safe. Come.

21:35.795 --> 21:40.099
(footsteps plodding)
(pensive music continues)

21:40.199 --> 21:42.902
(coins clinking)

21:44.571 --> 21:45.672
More dead?

21:47.807 --> 21:50.276
Yeah, drowned like the others.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.747
(coins clinking)

21:54.814 --> 21:57.484
- Have mercy on those
that crave thy mercy.

21:57.584 --> 21:59.085
Have grace unto them
and make it such

21:59.151 --> 22:01.854
that they may, too,
enjoy thy grace.

22:01.954 --> 22:02.822
Go forward to life.

22:02.922 --> 22:05.291
(bag rustling)

22:05.392 --> 22:08.828
- Wasting your
prayers on the wicked.

22:08.928 --> 22:11.698
God has laid his
judgment on 'em.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.134
(footsteps plodding)

22:15.234 --> 22:16.102
(door clattering)

22:16.168 --> 22:17.870
(feet shuffling)

22:17.970 --> 22:20.507
(hand thuds)

22:20.607 --> 22:22.141
(items clattering)

22:22.241 --> 22:25.945
God is smiling at us
to send such good luck.

22:29.081 --> 22:30.349
(boot rasping)
(pensive music continues)

22:30.450 --> 22:32.852
(boot thuds)

22:32.952 --> 22:37.790
(clothes rustling)
(pensive music continues)

22:39.492 --> 22:42.529
(Anne sighs)

22:42.629 --> 22:46.866
He smashed those pirates against
our rocks for our benefit.

22:46.966 --> 22:47.834
Yes.

22:49.368 --> 22:52.004
(Morwen grunting)

22:55.942 --> 22:58.310
(body rasping)

22:58.377 --> 23:00.813
- I'll trade these
trinkets in market

23:00.880 --> 23:03.683
and be back before
the sun is set.

23:03.783 --> 23:08.588
(footsteps plodding)
(pensive music continues)

23:11.991 --> 23:12.892
(pot clanking)

23:12.992 --> 23:15.495
(soup burbling)

23:15.562 --> 23:20.399
(soup sloshing)
(fire crackling)

23:24.003 --> 23:26.939
(utensil clanking)

23:27.039 --> 23:30.910
(birds chirping and squawking)

23:31.010 --> 23:35.848
(pensive music continues)
(birds continue squawking)

23:39.185 --> 23:42.421
(horse neighing)

23:42.522 --> 23:45.057
(brooding music)

23:50.362 --> 23:55.034
(feet pattering)
(brooding music continues)

23:58.337 --> 24:01.040
(birds squawking)

24:04.276 --> 24:06.979
- [Anne] I think
there's a man out there.

24:07.079 --> 24:11.150
- Silly child, there's
no one out there, hon.

24:11.250 --> 24:15.622
Sometimes I think you're
a bit mad (laughs)

24:15.722 --> 24:20.292
like your mother before you.
(brooding music continues)

24:21.528 --> 24:23.129
(Morwen exhales)

24:23.229 --> 24:24.764
Go on. Rest, child.

24:28.601 --> 24:31.270
(pensive music)

24:32.639 --> 24:37.143
(birds chirping)
(grass rustling)

24:38.778 --> 24:43.082
(Jago humming)
(footsteps plodding)

24:56.896 --> 24:58.097
Hello, Anne.

24:59.331 --> 25:03.803
Are you well?
(grass rustling)

25:03.903 --> 25:05.805
Where are you walking to?

25:06.973 --> 25:08.641
To church.

25:08.741 --> 25:12.478
- Ah, I've lost my taste
for pretty sermons.

25:12.579 --> 25:15.114
(grass rustling)

25:17.149 --> 25:20.720
But don't you know you
shouldn't be walking alone here?

25:20.820 --> 25:22.889
There are bad men on this road.

25:22.989 --> 25:24.123
They would steal a girl like you

25:24.190 --> 25:25.391
- away from home.
- I know the path.

25:25.491 --> 25:26.392
I'll be safe.

25:29.161 --> 25:31.497
I'll walk with you.

25:31.598 --> 25:33.532
Perhaps you'd like the company.

25:33.633 --> 25:37.136
- I shouldn't walk with a
man who's not my husband.

25:38.437 --> 25:40.740
Your husband's dead.

25:40.840 --> 25:44.744
(pensive music)
(grass rustling)

25:44.844 --> 25:47.747
- Walk well enough
without your help.

25:50.617 --> 25:53.252
(Jago sniffs)
(pensive music continues)

25:53.352 --> 25:58.157
(water sloshing)
(birds chirping)

26:02.561 --> 26:07.399
(item clattering)
(grass rustling)

26:16.142 --> 26:17.376
Hello, Morwen.

26:18.845 --> 26:21.513
What a fine day.
(grass rustling)

26:21.580 --> 26:25.417
Sun is nearly shining,
and the breeze is gentle.

26:26.853 --> 26:28.120
- Come, Anne.
(brooding music)

26:28.220 --> 26:31.023
(grass rustling)

26:33.826 --> 26:34.694
Hag.

26:35.895 --> 26:37.797
(knife thudding)

26:37.897 --> 26:42.769
(hands rasping)
(footsteps plodding)

26:43.602 --> 26:45.104
(knife thudding)

26:45.204 --> 26:47.273
- You were at
church all morning?

26:47.373 --> 26:48.607
- [Anne] Mm-hmm.

26:50.276 --> 26:53.746
(food sizzling)
(fire crackling)

26:53.846 --> 26:56.082
And he followed you there?

26:57.083 --> 26:58.317
[Anne] Yes.

26:58.417 --> 27:03.222
(Morwen groans)
(fire crackling)

27:04.423 --> 27:05.591
I never liked that boy.

27:08.127 --> 27:10.162
(Morwen laughs)
(pensive music)

27:10.262 --> 27:12.832
He always had a
jealous look about him,

27:12.932 --> 27:13.766
(knife thudding)

27:13.866 --> 27:15.601
even as a child.

27:15.702 --> 27:20.506
(footsteps plodding)
(pensive music continues)

27:20.606 --> 27:23.242
(birds chirping)

27:25.244 --> 27:29.015
Always following
Seamus everywhere.

27:29.115 --> 27:31.517
I saw the angry look in his eye,

27:32.819 --> 27:33.853
parentless rat.

27:35.587 --> 27:37.790
(birds chirping)
(pensive music continues)

27:37.890 --> 27:41.160
(laughs) Look like a stray dog,

27:41.260 --> 27:44.430
always sniffing
around for scraps.

27:44.496 --> 27:48.835
(rain pattering)
(pensive music continues)

27:48.935 --> 27:52.438
(footsteps plodding)

27:52.504 --> 27:55.641
Greed, has Jago's heart,
I'm sure of it.

27:58.577 --> 28:01.881
- It's...
(knife thudding)

28:01.981 --> 28:05.284
We were such close friends
before I married Seamus.

28:05.351 --> 28:08.821
I, I had forgotten
our time together.

28:08.921 --> 28:11.523
I, I do not think
him an evil man.

28:13.525 --> 28:18.197
- (laughs) Evil is
not always obvious.

28:18.297 --> 28:21.633
(fire crackling)
(pensive music)

28:21.700 --> 28:23.335
This is a time of war.

28:26.138 --> 28:29.341
There is a lot that
spreads all around us.

28:31.177 --> 28:34.013
Demons walk the earth
in the shape of men.

28:36.215 --> 28:39.218
(hooves clopping)
(metal clanging)

28:39.318 --> 28:43.189
Stay with me, and you'll
have nothing to fear.

28:43.289 --> 28:45.925
With me, you'll never be cursed.

28:47.026 --> 28:48.560
But if you disobey me,

28:51.831 --> 28:56.702
the knights of hell will
drag you down into the pit,

28:56.803 --> 29:00.072
and there'll be nothing
I can do to save you.

29:00.172 --> 29:04.944
(hooves clopping)
(horse neighing)

29:05.812 --> 29:06.678
I, I promise.

29:06.745 --> 29:07.379
Oh, oh.

29:11.217 --> 29:14.020
(fire crackling)

29:15.587 --> 29:19.859
(birds chirping)
(footsteps plodding)

29:19.926 --> 29:23.362
(person speaking faintly)

29:25.764 --> 29:28.935
(footsteps plodding)

29:29.035 --> 29:30.569
(door creaking)

29:30.669 --> 29:31.938
Ah, Anne, come.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.541
(door clattering)

29:35.607 --> 29:38.477
Friar Penros has found
us on the road home.

29:38.577 --> 29:41.047
- Friar Penros.
- Hello, Anne.

29:43.182 --> 29:46.919
- Sorry we don't have
more to offer you.

29:47.019 --> 29:49.388
This is the last of our stores.

29:50.622 --> 29:52.791
These are difficult times.

29:52.892 --> 29:57.096
- Course, uh, but do you
have anything to drink?

29:57.196 --> 29:58.664
My throat is parched.

30:00.867 --> 30:01.767
Hmm.

30:02.701 --> 30:04.270
(cup thuds)

30:04.370 --> 30:07.406
(Friar Penros laughs)

30:08.407 --> 30:11.277
(liquid sloshing)

30:13.245 --> 30:14.113
Bless you.

30:15.214 --> 30:17.850
(footsteps plodding)

30:17.950 --> 30:18.817
Mm.

30:20.619 --> 30:23.289
(lips smacking)

30:24.991 --> 30:25.992
(water sloshing)

30:26.092 --> 30:27.759
(cup thuds)
Mm.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.429
(fire crackling)

30:34.400 --> 30:36.635
Forgive me, Lord, my hunger.

30:39.638 --> 30:41.373
Blessed us, oh, Lord,
and these, thy gifts,

30:41.473 --> 30:43.675
which we are about to receive

30:43.775 --> 30:47.346
from thy bounty through
Christ our Lord, amen.

30:47.446 --> 30:48.814
- Amen.
- Amen.

30:48.915 --> 30:51.617
Mm, brings joy to my heart

30:51.683 --> 30:55.521
to see two such pious women.
(pensive music)

30:55.621 --> 30:57.156
(cup thuds)
(lips smacking)

30:57.256 --> 30:59.658
I'll show you a
special relic,

30:59.758 --> 31:02.861
so you can share in the
glory of my pilgrimage.

31:02.962 --> 31:07.833
(box and items clattering)
(pensive music continues)

31:15.307 --> 31:16.175
Just put that back.

31:16.275 --> 31:17.243
(bottle thuds)

31:17.343 --> 31:18.477
Here we are.

31:20.812 --> 31:25.484
- Oh, how beautiful.
(pensive music continues)

31:26.218 --> 31:27.053
Open it.

31:29.221 --> 31:32.091
(lid clanks)

31:32.191 --> 31:33.325
[Anne] Oh.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.861
Do not touch, child. Careful.

31:35.962 --> 31:39.198
These trinkets are more
valuable than you can imagine.

31:39.298 --> 31:42.834
- [Anne] (laughs) It's
wonderful, Father.

31:42.901 --> 31:46.172
- For our Lord
Jesus's blessed life

31:46.238 --> 31:48.107
from a Bethlehem dove.

31:50.676 --> 31:52.511
Three silver pieces,

31:54.080 --> 31:57.683
special price for
such a faithful flock.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.585
- We can't afford
such beautiful gifts.

31:59.685 --> 32:00.719
We don't have any money.

32:00.819 --> 32:03.089
(lid thuds)

32:05.391 --> 32:06.458
Very well then.

32:06.558 --> 32:08.260
(box clattering)

32:08.360 --> 32:09.928
(footsteps plodding)
(lips smacking)

32:10.029 --> 32:14.300
- Who else knows you've
returned from your travels?

32:14.400 --> 32:17.369
- You are but the first.
(utensil clanking)

32:17.436 --> 32:21.240
- I'm sure you're eager
to continue your journey.

32:21.340 --> 32:25.444
- Aye, I'm just passing
through. I am London bound.

32:27.579 --> 32:29.815
Well, thank you for
your hospitality.

32:29.915 --> 32:31.483
I must continue my journey

32:31.583 --> 32:32.718
before too much of
the day has passed.

32:32.784 --> 32:37.556
(items clattering)
(pensive music)

32:39.191 --> 32:40.959
A blessing before I go.

32:41.060 --> 32:45.264
(Friar Penros
inhales and exhales)

32:45.364 --> 32:48.334
The Lord shall preserve
thee from all evil.

32:48.434 --> 32:52.104
Yea, it is even he that
shall keep thy soul.

32:52.204 --> 32:55.507
Glory to the Father as
it was in the beginning.

32:55.607 --> 33:00.446
Lord have mercy upon us, our
Father, which art in heaven,

33:01.947 --> 33:03.582
and lead us not into
temptation, amen.

33:05.251 --> 33:08.354
- Amen.
(pensive music)

33:08.454 --> 33:11.990
- Beware of heretical
thoughts, my friend.

33:12.091 --> 33:13.992
Those lies do nothing for you

33:14.093 --> 33:17.996
but illuminate the hideous
truths that surround us.

33:18.097 --> 33:20.599
Stay in the warm, blind bliss.

33:21.967 --> 33:22.768
(dramatic music)
(Friar Penros grunts)

33:22.834 --> 33:24.002
(knife rasping)

33:24.103 --> 33:24.936
(Friar Penros screams)

33:25.003 --> 33:25.637
No, no.

33:27.839 --> 33:29.007
(Friar Penros grunts)
(knife rasping)

33:29.108 --> 33:30.109
(Morwen screams)
No.

33:30.176 --> 33:31.343
(body thudding)

33:31.443 --> 33:32.811
(Friar Penros coughing)

33:32.911 --> 33:34.213
[Morwen] Move aside.

33:34.313 --> 33:35.147
(Anne whimpering)

33:35.281 --> 33:37.149
(body rasping)

33:37.249 --> 33:38.550
(Anne gasps)

33:38.650 --> 33:42.521
(Anne whimpering and panting)

33:47.359 --> 33:49.395
What did you do?

33:49.495 --> 33:51.863
He was making a mess.

33:51.963 --> 33:55.167
- Are, are you mad? He's,
he's a, he's a man of God.

33:55.267 --> 33:56.502
He's a holy man.

33:57.503 --> 34:00.038
Ah, he wasn't a, a man of God.

34:02.641 --> 34:05.477
He was a charlatan and a fool.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.513
He was a false pretender.

34:09.148 --> 34:12.518
These items will feed
us through the winter.

34:13.485 --> 34:16.222
(Anne sobbing)

34:16.322 --> 34:17.489
You understand.

34:19.158 --> 34:22.728
You, you understand.
(pensive music)

34:22.828 --> 34:24.563
(Anne breathing heavily)

34:24.663 --> 34:27.433
(brooding music)

34:29.901 --> 34:33.505
(Anne and Morwen grunting)

34:39.478 --> 34:42.047
(thunder rumbling)

34:42.148 --> 34:44.750
(both grunting)
(body thudding)

34:44.850 --> 34:45.684
Come on.

34:46.518 --> 34:49.355
(Morwen grunting)

34:53.325 --> 34:58.130
(water sloshing)
(brooding music continues)

35:00.266 --> 35:05.103
(cloth rasping)
(brooding music continues)

35:08.006 --> 35:10.709
(grass rustling)

35:12.278 --> 35:16.715
(water sloshing)
(brooding music continues)

35:17.383 --> 35:19.951
(cloth rasping)

35:26.525 --> 35:31.330
(thunder rumbling)
(brooding music continues)

35:36.101 --> 35:39.471
There was talk around
Friar Penros, you know,

35:39.571 --> 35:42.441
that he was a philander.

35:42.541 --> 35:46.978
His heart had been claimed by
Mammon, by the lusty feels

35:47.078 --> 35:50.682
for material wealth,
and shiny objects,

35:50.782 --> 35:53.919
and the soft gaze of
foolish young girls.

35:55.587 --> 35:56.822
He was false.

36:02.994 --> 36:03.762
Morwen.

36:06.398 --> 36:07.266
Yes.

36:10.902 --> 36:14.773
- I don't know if I can
be as strong as you, as,

36:18.244 --> 36:19.044
as ruthless.

36:23.982 --> 36:26.985
I do not know if we
did the right thing.

36:28.687 --> 36:31.457
- All that matters
is that we survive.

36:33.625 --> 36:35.794
You must be very cautious

36:37.596 --> 36:39.465
not to give in to sin,

36:41.166 --> 36:41.800
to lust.

36:46.104 --> 36:49.675
I couldn't bear the
thought of you in hell,

36:51.677 --> 36:54.713
never to be reunited
with my son,

36:54.813 --> 36:58.517
your sweet husband in
Heaven where he sits now.

37:01.653 --> 37:03.489
You must be vigilant.

37:03.555 --> 37:05.023
You must be pious.

37:06.625 --> 37:08.894
You will be reunited with him.

37:08.994 --> 37:10.896
Isn't that what you want?

37:12.531 --> 37:16.201
- Of course.
(fire crackling)

37:18.704 --> 37:21.607
(Morwen laughs)

37:21.707 --> 37:25.344
- Well, mm.
(pensive music)

37:27.313 --> 37:29.047
Mm, you're a good girl.

37:34.720 --> 37:39.558
(birds chirping)
(pensive music continues)

37:43.562 --> 37:45.931
(rug thuds)

37:46.031 --> 37:50.869
(metal rasping)
(pensive music continues)

37:58.109 --> 37:59.378
[Anne] Morwen.

38:01.246 --> 38:02.414
(birds chirping)

38:02.514 --> 38:05.317
(animal squealing)

38:10.522 --> 38:12.090
(birds chirping)
(brooding music)

38:27.606 --> 38:32.478
(birds chirping)
(brooding music continues)

38:37.783 --> 38:38.684
(animal screeching)

38:38.784 --> 38:40.952
(footsteps plodding)

38:41.052 --> 38:45.924
(birds squawking)
(footsteps continue plodding)

38:47.125 --> 38:51.930
(bag rustling)
(pensive music)

39:00.171 --> 39:02.941
(grass rustling)

39:05.176 --> 39:09.515
(dramatic music)
(horses neighing)

39:09.615 --> 39:12.518
(hooves clopping)

39:16.788 --> 39:18.289
(sword rasping)
(Anne screaming)

39:18.356 --> 39:22.994
(hooves clopping)

39:32.871 --> 39:35.373
(Anne gasping)
(voices whispering)

39:35.474 --> 39:36.307
(Anne grunts)

39:36.374 --> 39:38.977
(Anne gasping)

39:39.044 --> 39:41.880
- [Jago] Anne.
(feet pattering)

39:41.980 --> 39:43.348
- Jago.
- Hey.

39:43.449 --> 39:44.583
- Did you see him?
- Did I see who?

39:44.683 --> 39:45.684
I, I, I think he is a demon.

39:45.784 --> 39:47.052
He's, he's not

39:47.152 --> 39:48.554
- from this world.
- Ah, there's-

39:48.654 --> 39:49.588
- He's following me.
- no one there.

39:49.688 --> 39:51.156
There's no one there.

39:51.222 --> 39:52.357
- It, it's just us here.
- No, he was there.

39:52.458 --> 39:53.759
He, he wears a, a suit of armor,

39:53.859 --> 39:55.561
and he, he rides a white horse.

39:55.661 --> 39:58.597
- Why would a
demon need a horse?

39:58.697 --> 40:02.400
It's just some soldier traveling
through to Manor Trematon,

40:02.501 --> 40:05.070
someone made of flesh and blood.

40:05.170 --> 40:07.105
Come. Sit down.

40:07.205 --> 40:10.576
(Anne breathing heavily)

40:21.653 --> 40:22.454
- Anne.
- Yeah.

40:26.492 --> 40:27.626
You found me.

40:32.230 --> 40:33.031
What?

40:34.700 --> 40:38.036
- You were scared, and
you came to find me.

40:39.771 --> 40:41.239
I'm glad you came.

40:43.875 --> 40:44.876
What is it?

40:47.012 --> 40:48.046
I'm afraid.

40:49.047 --> 40:50.816
(Jago laughs)

40:50.916 --> 40:52.618
Afraid.

40:52.718 --> 40:56.221
- Don't mock me, afraid
of what might happen.

40:58.123 --> 40:59.825
I don't want to be marked
by a knight of hell.

40:59.925 --> 41:03.328
I don't want to be cursed
and dragged into the pit.

41:03.428 --> 41:06.164
Cursed, Anne? Are you a child?

41:06.264 --> 41:09.768
- Morwen told me that-
- Ah, that hag.

41:09.868 --> 41:11.970
Doesn't know anything,

41:12.070 --> 41:14.072
just trying to scare you.

41:15.941 --> 41:17.108
Hell is real.

41:18.143 --> 41:19.077
Aye.

41:20.278 --> 41:21.446
I've seen hell.

41:23.414 --> 41:27.519
It's 50 leagues in that
direction, and it is real.

41:27.619 --> 41:29.621
(pensive music)

41:29.721 --> 41:33.358
Hell is the war between the
rich men and spilt blood.

41:34.926 --> 41:37.529
But this, Anne,
this is also real.

41:42.167 --> 41:45.103
I want you, Anne,
and you want me.

41:47.505 --> 41:49.107
Come to me tonight.

41:49.174 --> 41:52.110
There'll be no
demons to haunt you.

41:52.177 --> 41:56.948
Meet me where we used to play
as children. Do you remember?

41:58.283 --> 41:59.618
It's just us now.

42:01.587 --> 42:06.124
Come to me tonight.
(pensive music continues)

42:10.929 --> 42:16.001
(grass rustling)

42:20.505 --> 42:24.075
(person humming)
(grass continues rustling)

42:24.175 --> 42:26.978
(brooding music)

42:29.547 --> 42:34.152
(flesh squelching)
(brooding music continues)

42:48.900 --> 42:50.435
This is my dream.

42:52.037 --> 42:53.939
Go.
(dramatic music)

42:54.039 --> 42:56.875
(crickets chirping)

42:59.745 --> 43:02.247
(bed creaking)

43:13.825 --> 43:15.060
Are you awake?

43:19.030 --> 43:23.869
(clothes rustling)
(crickets continue chirping)

43:25.370 --> 43:26.371
(floor creaking)

43:26.437 --> 43:29.207
(feet shuffling)

43:30.441 --> 43:33.111
(door creaking)

43:34.880 --> 43:36.882
(door clattering)

43:36.948 --> 43:38.549
(Morwen inhales)

43:38.616 --> 43:41.787
(bedding rustling)
(footsteps plodding)

43:51.362 --> 43:56.234
(animal bellowing)
(eerie music)

44:14.920 --> 44:19.758
(knife rasping)
(fire crackling)

44:25.430 --> 44:27.432
- You came.
(pensive music)

44:27.498 --> 44:29.100
I shouldn't have.

44:31.269 --> 44:32.938
I shouldn't be here.

44:39.344 --> 44:42.848
(pensive music continues)

44:57.495 --> 45:00.866
(birds chirping)
(waves lapping)

45:00.966 --> 45:03.468
Wake up. (laughs)

45:03.534 --> 45:05.003
I have to go back.

45:06.972 --> 45:08.807
Come and live with me.

45:15.446 --> 45:17.515
- Come live with me.
- I can't.

45:17.615 --> 45:20.318
- Why can't you?
(pensive music continues)

45:21.953 --> 45:23.321
She needs me.

45:26.391 --> 45:29.027
- That woman can
fend for herself.

45:33.031 --> 45:34.365
She frightens me.

45:37.235 --> 45:39.938
(leaves rustling)
(pensive music continues)

45:40.038 --> 45:44.342
- [Jago] She will drain
every bit of life out of you.

45:46.244 --> 45:48.346
I can see it clear as day.

45:52.650 --> 45:56.354
Come live with me, and
I will make you happy.

46:00.091 --> 46:03.128
(footsteps plodding)

46:03.228 --> 46:06.364
(voices whispering)

46:17.242 --> 46:19.577
(clothes rustling)

46:24.782 --> 46:27.552
(bedding rustling)

46:40.265 --> 46:41.900
Where have you been?

46:41.967 --> 46:44.302
(pensive music)

46:44.402 --> 46:46.437
I wanted some fresh air.

46:52.878 --> 46:55.413
You know I'd die without you.

46:59.484 --> 47:01.419
I think you're my angel

47:08.226 --> 47:11.429
sent to care for me
in my son's absence.

47:15.500 --> 47:18.036
We're more precious
to each other

47:19.737 --> 47:21.940
than all the treasures
in the world.

47:24.675 --> 47:26.644
I don't want to be alone.

47:31.316 --> 47:32.217
I know.

47:36.154 --> 47:38.156
(Morwen inhales)

47:38.256 --> 47:40.458
Know I'll take care of you.

47:42.260 --> 47:46.197
(pensive music continues)

47:46.297 --> 47:48.066
(waves lapping)
(birds chirping)

48:04.882 --> 48:06.717
(pensive music)
(cart clattering)

48:23.301 --> 48:25.236
(cart creaking)
(pensive music continues)

48:25.336 --> 48:27.172
(footsteps plodding)
(crickets chirping)

48:32.010 --> 48:35.213
- What are you doing here
in the middle of the cold?

48:35.313 --> 48:36.681
(footsteps plodding)

48:36.747 --> 48:38.116
(traveler grunts)
(dramatic music)

48:38.216 --> 48:39.784
(knife rasping)
(blood squelching)

48:39.884 --> 48:41.052
- Help me. What are you
doing just standing there?

48:41.152 --> 48:42.453
Help me.
(traveler gagging)

48:42.553 --> 48:46.124
(footsteps plodding)
(both grunting)

48:46.224 --> 48:48.859
Okay. (panting)

48:48.926 --> 48:51.929
He may have valuables
in his pocket. Look.

48:52.030 --> 48:54.032
(footsteps plodding)

48:54.099 --> 48:57.402
(Morwen exhales)
(footsteps continue plodding)

49:02.607 --> 49:04.875

49:04.942 --> 49:06.777
(items clattering)
(pensive music continues)

49:19.857 --> 49:21.959
(footsteps plodding)
(pensive music continues)

49:23.628 --> 49:24.562
What's this?

49:29.967 --> 49:32.570
Nothing, it's just
a child's joy.

49:36.607 --> 49:38.176
(bag rustling)

49:45.883 --> 49:47.518
(coins clinking)
(pensive music continues)

49:47.618 --> 49:48.786
(bell tolling)
(coins continue clinking)

49:59.564 --> 50:02.100
(eerie music)

50:06.471 --> 50:08.339
(cloth rasping)

50:08.439 --> 50:11.509
(voices whispering)

50:16.614 --> 50:18.015

50:20.017 --> 50:22.820
(voices whispering)
(knight breathing heavily)

50:23.988 --> 50:27.225
(nuns singing in Latin)

50:41.872 --> 50:46.711
(baby vocalizing)
(pensive music)

50:53.884 --> 50:57.322
(baby crying)
(pensive music continues)

50:58.223 --> 51:03.060
(nuns singing in Latin)
(baby continues crying)

51:11.902 --> 51:12.703
(door clattering)

51:12.837 --> 51:14.672
* <i>Amen</i> *

51:16.507 --> 51:18.276
(clothes rustling)
(pensive music continues)

51:29.587 --> 51:32.257
- [Priest] God
protect you, child.

51:35.593 --> 51:36.561
(footsteps plodding)
(pensive music continues)

51:36.661 --> 51:39.530
(baby vocalizing)

51:46.504 --> 51:47.705
Huh, beautiful.

51:51.342 --> 51:52.210
Yeah.

51:54.379 --> 51:54.979
Morwen.

51:59.217 --> 52:03.221
(baby vocalizing)
(pensive music continues)

52:03.288 --> 52:06.157
(footsteps plodding)

52:07.592 --> 52:09.960
(May laughs)

52:12.197 --> 52:13.331
A gift.

52:13.431 --> 52:16.334
(footsteps plodding)

52:19.237 --> 52:20.805
(item clattering)

52:20.905 --> 52:21.739
(hand knocking)

52:21.806 --> 52:22.740
[Jago] Anne.

52:24.975 --> 52:26.911
Stay here, child.

52:26.977 --> 52:29.146
[Jago] Anne, are ya in there?

52:29.614 --> 52:32.517
(door clattering and creaking)

52:32.617 --> 52:34.752
[Morwen] What do you want?

52:36.387 --> 52:38.923
(door creaking and clattering)

52:38.989 --> 52:41.359
What, you're deaf now, too?

52:41.459 --> 52:43.328
It's not you I
want, is it? Anne.

52:43.428 --> 52:45.330
She came back to me, pup.

52:45.430 --> 52:48.266
Find yourself another
bitch to fuck.

52:50.301 --> 52:52.470
- Ah, move, you sorry
woman, or I'll push through.

52:52.570 --> 52:54.372
(hand thuds)

52:54.472 --> 52:56.774
- Go away.
(pensive music)

52:59.910 --> 53:03.514
- She's young, and strong,
and she can bear a child,

53:03.614 --> 53:05.049
and you would take
that from her?

53:05.149 --> 53:09.520
- (laughs) Yes,
1,000 times, yes.

53:09.620 --> 53:12.990
What joy has a husband or
child ever brought to me?

53:13.090 --> 53:14.692
None,
(saliva sputtering)

53:14.792 --> 53:17.127
only the grief of
losing them too soon

53:17.194 --> 53:20.731
and suffering a long and
angry life after they've gone.

53:20.831 --> 53:23.200
Yes, I would take that from her.

53:23.301 --> 53:26.203
Yes, I would live
through this winter.

53:26.304 --> 53:30.908
Yes, (laughs) I would deny
you the pleasure of her body.

53:31.008 --> 53:34.379
Ah, to hell with you. (groans)

53:34.479 --> 53:37.014
- And I will take you
straight to hell, fool.

53:40.951 --> 53:44.255
(footsteps plodding)
(pensive music continues)

53:46.691 --> 53:48.826
Anne, I'll wait for you.

53:50.561 --> 53:52.663
I'll wait for you, Anne.

53:54.699 --> 53:58.869
(Jago spitting)
(pensive music continues)

54:01.872 --> 54:04.208
(door creaking and clattering)

54:09.013 --> 54:11.749
(fire crackling)

54:15.420 --> 54:17.221
You're upset.

54:17.322 --> 54:20.858
Oh, sweet child, sweet
child, you're upset.

54:22.660 --> 54:23.528
(Anne exhales)

54:23.594 --> 54:24.862
This is our fate.

54:26.864 --> 54:28.799
It is not your destiny. (laughs)

54:28.899 --> 54:30.868
This is where we belong.

54:34.439 --> 54:36.073
You are my son's wife.

54:37.908 --> 54:39.276
I am your family.

54:41.912 --> 54:44.382
I am your responsibility.

54:44.449 --> 54:45.883
It is God's law.

54:51.589 --> 54:56.060
(Morwen sniffing)
(wind howling)

54:56.126 --> 54:58.596
(fire crackling)
(pensive music)

54:58.696 --> 55:01.265
(Anne sobbing)

55:02.567 --> 55:04.735
Mother, my heart is torn,

55:08.205 --> 55:10.475
and I am hungry all the time

55:12.977 --> 55:15.279
for things that I have lost.

55:17.214 --> 55:20.284
Why would you leave
me here to starve?

55:23.788 --> 55:27.291
(pensive music continues)

55:29.594 --> 55:30.595
Forgive me.

55:32.763 --> 55:34.832
I have an unruly tongue.

55:37.134 --> 55:39.937
Lord God, I am your
servant, always.

55:44.409 --> 55:45.543
But I'm afraid.

55:50.948 --> 55:53.618
What were you trying to tell me?

55:55.653 --> 55:57.988
(pensive music continues)

56:00.124 --> 56:02.460
(Anne sighs)

56:03.594 --> 56:06.196
(leaves rustling)

56:10.535 --> 56:12.302
(pestle thudding)

56:12.369 --> 56:15.706
(pestle rasping and clanking)

56:15.806 --> 56:19.043
(water sloshing)

56:19.143 --> 56:20.678
(kettle thuds)

56:31.188 --> 56:32.990
Morwen, are you awake?

56:39.530 --> 56:42.266
(Morwen snoring)

56:43.568 --> 56:46.070
(fire crackling)

56:46.170 --> 56:48.172
(door creaking and clattering)

56:51.676 --> 56:54.278
(waves lapping)
(pensive music continues)

56:58.082 --> 57:00.184
(birds chirping)

57:00.250 --> 57:01.719
I heard of a man

57:03.721 --> 57:07.925
who saw a beautiful woman
walking to church every day.

57:08.025 --> 57:12.296
(water sloshing)
(gentle music)

57:12.396 --> 57:14.932
Nobody knew where she was from,

57:16.934 --> 57:19.604
but the man fell
in love with her.

57:21.506 --> 57:25.442
Matha E. Chawalla was his
name, and he loved to sing.

57:28.112 --> 57:30.748
Finally, one day,
he followed her,

57:34.384 --> 57:37.421
and he sang a song
to her as she walked,

57:41.926 --> 57:44.562
and he was never seen again.

57:44.629 --> 57:47.798
(birds chirping and squawking)

57:47.898 --> 57:49.634
What happened to him?

57:54.939 --> 57:57.942
- Well, I think he
followed her into the sea.

58:00.545 --> 58:02.279
So she was a mermaid.

58:04.381 --> 58:06.851
(Jago laughs)

58:08.385 --> 58:11.488
Maybe I'll drag you
down into the water.

58:11.589 --> 58:15.693
(Anne laughs)
(gentle music continues)

58:54.799 --> 58:58.636
(chair clattering)
(fire crackling)

59:00.304 --> 59:01.138
Anne?

59:03.007 --> 59:04.575
(Morwen sighs)

59:14.351 --> 59:16.520
(door clattering)

59:19.223 --> 59:21.659
(feet shuffling)

59:22.727 --> 59:24.361
(Morwen sighs)
(hands rasping)

59:27.665 --> 59:30.034
(footsteps plodding)
(wind rustling)

59:32.136 --> 59:33.003
Anne?

59:34.972 --> 59:36.774
(footsteps plodding)
(wind rustling)

59:41.478 --> 59:43.180
Anne.
(footsteps continue plodding)

59:43.247 --> 59:45.082
(pensive music)
(footsteps continue plodding)

59:49.053 --> 59:50.420
Are you out here?

59:52.256 --> 59:54.925
(horse neighing)
(brooding music)

59:55.025 --> 59:56.226
(hooves clopping)
(brooding music continues)

59:59.563 --> 01:00:02.199
(feet pattering)

01:00:06.503 --> 01:00:08.205
(horse nickering)
(brooding music continues)

01:00:12.877 --> 01:00:14.478
(birds squawking)

01:00:19.516 --> 01:00:21.986
(hooves clopping)
(brooding music continues)

01:00:22.086 --> 01:00:24.254
(metal clanging)
(hooves continue clopping)

01:00:43.741 --> 01:00:46.610
(metal rasping)
(brooding music)

01:00:52.049 --> 01:00:53.818
(knight exhales)

01:00:57.722 --> 01:00:59.256
(Morwen breathing heavily)

01:01:01.458 --> 01:01:04.094
Anne.
(pensive music)

01:01:10.768 --> 01:01:13.871
(hooves clopping)
(pensive music continues)

01:01:30.921 --> 01:01:32.656
(footsteps plodding)

01:01:32.757 --> 01:01:34.892
(birds squawking)
(footsteps continue plodding)

01:01:37.194 --> 01:01:39.063
(dramatic music)
(metal clanging)

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:55.312
(brooding music)

01:01:59.784 --> 01:02:01.685
(footsteps plodding)

01:02:05.289 --> 01:02:06.356
(armor clinking)

01:02:07.691 --> 01:02:09.259
(dramatic music)
(sword rasping)

01:02:09.359 --> 01:02:10.194
(birds squawking)
(brooding music)

01:02:17.835 --> 01:02:19.703
(knight grunting)
(armor clinking)

01:02:29.746 --> 01:02:30.915
(knight groaning)

01:02:33.217 --> 01:02:35.052
(armor clattering)
(knight continues groaning)

01:02:48.999 --> 01:02:51.401
(knife rasping)
(knight screaming)

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:54.404
(knight coughing and gasping)
(dramatic music continues)

01:02:59.844 --> 01:03:01.645
(armor clinking)
(knight groaning)

01:03:05.950 --> 01:03:07.717
(armor clattering)

01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:09.219
(knight groaning)
(dramatic music continues)

01:03:11.255 --> 01:03:12.823
(armor clattering)

01:03:15.192 --> 01:03:17.261
(water splashing)

01:03:18.595 --> 01:03:20.397
(Morwen grunting)
(knight groaning)

01:03:25.102 --> 01:03:27.771
(knight coughing)
(Morwen continues grunting)

01:03:35.712 --> 01:03:37.581
(water splashing)
(pensive music)

01:03:50.394 --> 01:03:52.362
(Morwen grunts)
(knife rasping)

01:03:52.462 --> 01:03:57.167
(bag rustling)
(coins clinking)

01:03:57.267 --> 01:04:02.039
(knife rasping)
(voices whispering)

01:04:13.083 --> 01:04:15.685
(Morwen grunting)

01:04:24.962 --> 01:04:26.830
(waves lapping)
(birds chirping)

01:04:32.636 --> 01:04:34.871
- [Jago] What thoughts
have you in mind?

01:04:38.342 --> 01:04:40.544
Just thoughts, nothing more.

01:04:44.048 --> 01:04:46.483
- Share them with me.
(fire crackling)

01:04:56.326 --> 01:04:57.727
I think of demons.

01:05:00.664 --> 01:05:01.565
[Jago] Wow.

01:05:04.368 --> 01:05:07.704
- Yesterday, in the
sermon, the father spoke

01:05:07.804 --> 01:05:09.506
of the demon Mammon,

01:05:11.976 --> 01:05:16.213
who lusts for earthly
pleasures and material wealth,

01:05:19.216 --> 01:05:21.518
and I looked on Mistress May

01:05:23.387 --> 01:05:26.290
happy with her newborn child

01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:29.593
who wears a silver cross
fashioned for his tiny neck,

01:05:29.693 --> 01:05:32.029
and, and I was

01:05:35.165 --> 01:05:39.103
filled with a terrifying greed.

01:05:42.606 --> 01:05:44.574
(birds chirping)
(fire crackling)

01:05:48.545 --> 01:05:49.613
I want what she has.

01:05:52.849 --> 01:05:54.318
I want her wealth,

01:05:57.787 --> 01:06:02.059
and her comfort, and
her happy rosy cheeks,

01:06:02.526 --> 01:06:03.827
and her fat baby.

01:06:11.268 --> 01:06:13.337
Well, why shouldn't you?

01:06:18.375 --> 01:06:21.278
- Perhaps it's you
who are the demon.

01:06:22.546 --> 01:06:23.980
(pensive music)

01:06:24.081 --> 01:06:26.183
(Jago grunting)
(Anne laughs)

01:06:26.283 --> 01:06:28.152
(fire crackling)
(pensive music continues)

01:06:33.657 --> 01:06:35.592
You thinking on him?

01:06:41.598 --> 01:06:44.000
It was always the three of us,

01:06:47.471 --> 01:06:50.807
and now everything has
changed so suddenly.

01:06:52.909 --> 01:06:55.379
Aye, everything has changed.

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:00.617
Leave her.

01:07:02.352 --> 01:07:03.820
Come live with me.

01:07:08.458 --> 01:07:10.627
I'm all she has.

01:07:10.694 --> 01:07:13.830
- I need a wife, and
you have no husband.

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:18.001
Come live with me.

01:07:19.103 --> 01:07:20.837
You don't understand.

01:07:24.441 --> 01:07:25.909
But I want you now.

01:07:28.512 --> 01:07:31.215
(gentle music)

01:07:31.315 --> 01:07:33.049
You are a greedy man.

01:07:41.525 --> 01:07:42.426
Aye.

01:07:46.830 --> 01:07:51.668
(birds chirping)
(gentle music continues)

01:07:56.140 --> 01:07:57.941
(footsteps plodding)
(birds continue chirping)

01:08:03.247 --> 01:08:06.015
- Morwen.
(door creaking)

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:07.251
I must speak with you.

01:08:07.351 --> 01:08:10.254
(door clattering)

01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:16.893
I have decided I'm going to
live with Jago and be his wife.

01:08:18.662 --> 01:08:20.297
This is what I want.

01:08:23.333 --> 01:08:24.701
Do you hear me?

01:08:26.170 --> 01:08:27.070
Morwen?

01:08:29.373 --> 01:08:32.542
I have always obeyed
you in all things.

01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:35.745
I followed your commands

01:08:35.845 --> 01:08:39.716
even when the things you
did made my stomach turn.

01:08:41.185 --> 01:08:44.554
I was content to
stay by your side.

01:08:44.621 --> 01:08:46.723
You were my husband's mother.

01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:51.628
But Seamus is gone.

01:08:51.728 --> 01:08:54.130
- (dramatic music)
- Don't say his name,

01:08:54.231 --> 01:08:55.098
slut, whore.

01:08:57.534 --> 01:09:00.337
You'll burn with
the rest of them.

01:09:00.437 --> 01:09:03.273
Don't you see what you're doing?

01:09:03.373 --> 01:09:04.974
- Morwen, I-

01:09:05.074 --> 01:09:08.512
- You'll abandon me and
condemn me to death,

01:09:08.612 --> 01:09:11.615
and the knights of
hell will come for you,

01:09:11.715 --> 01:09:14.851
and I will cheer for them.

01:09:14.951 --> 01:09:19.756
You cannot abandon your duty
to me without consequences.

01:09:20.790 --> 01:09:22.359
They will pull you down to hell.

01:09:25.395 --> 01:09:27.163
(Anne whimpering)
(dramatic music continues)

01:09:34.771 --> 01:09:36.540
(footsteps plodding)
(brooding music)

01:09:43.112 --> 01:09:45.849
- I won't live under
her thumb, (gasping)

01:09:45.949 --> 01:09:47.784
not for one more moment.

01:09:49.286 --> 01:09:50.787
I'll do what I want.

01:09:58.795 --> 01:10:01.398
(wind howling)

01:10:09.806 --> 01:10:12.576
(brooding music)

01:10:29.526 --> 01:10:32.028
(brooding music continues)

01:10:35.499 --> 01:10:37.033
(dramatic music)
(armor clattering)

01:10:38.335 --> 01:10:40.337
(sword rasping)

01:10:41.305 --> 01:10:42.539
I'm sorry.

01:10:42.639 --> 01:10:43.940
(air whooshing)
(sword rasping)

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:47.844
(Anne inhales and exhales)
(fire crackling)

01:11:00.757 --> 01:11:01.891
(birds squawking)
(fire continues crackling)

01:11:06.496 --> 01:11:07.764
(birds chirping)

01:11:07.864 --> 01:11:08.732
(Jago sniffs)

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:12.869
[Jago] It's cold and early,

01:11:15.572 --> 01:11:18.442
too early. (coughs)

01:11:20.677 --> 01:11:22.779
- Today is Sunday.
- Is it?

01:11:26.583 --> 01:11:29.586
- Come to the sermon
this afternoon with me.

01:11:31.555 --> 01:11:34.558
God's words will
soothe your soul.

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:37.293
(Jago laughs)

01:11:37.394 --> 01:11:39.896
(gentle music)

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:49.906
- You think my soul
needs soothing?

01:11:53.710 --> 01:11:55.912
I will make you a pious man.

01:12:04.588 --> 01:12:07.524
- May it please you
to prosper, Zion,

01:12:09.225 --> 01:12:11.928
to build up the
walls of Jerusalem.

01:12:13.963 --> 01:12:16.933
Then you will delight
in the sacrifices

01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:19.603
of the righteous

01:12:22.739 --> 01:12:25.208
in burnt offerings
offered whole.

01:12:27.176 --> 01:12:30.547
Then bulls will be
offered on your altar.

01:12:33.249 --> 01:12:35.118
(feet thudding)
(pensive music continues)

01:12:40.957 --> 01:12:42.125
(priest singing in Latin)

01:12:59.008 --> 01:13:01.878
(waves lapping)

01:13:01.978 --> 01:13:04.948
- [Children] <i>The fox and his</i>
<i>wife, without any strife,</i>

01:13:05.048 --> 01:13:07.917
<i>cut the goose with</i>
<i>a fork and knife.</i>

01:13:08.017 --> 01:13:10.554
<i>They never had such</i>
<i>supper in their life.</i>

01:13:10.654 --> 01:13:12.188
<i>The little ones</i>
<i>chewed on the bones,</i>

01:13:12.288 --> 01:13:14.257
<i>the bones, the bones.</i>

01:13:14.357 --> 01:13:15.825
(bodies thudding)
(children laughing)

01:13:15.892 --> 01:13:17.927
(waves lapping)
(gentle music)

01:13:18.027 --> 01:13:19.896
You failed us. I win.

01:13:19.996 --> 01:13:21.698
- I did not.
- You're a liar.

01:13:21.798 --> 01:13:23.332
Stop. It was me.

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:24.701
I failed us.

01:13:24.801 --> 01:13:27.771
(fist thudding)
(Jago groans)

01:13:27.871 --> 01:13:30.707
(pensive music)
(waves lapping)

01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:36.045
(footsteps plodding)
(waves continue lapping)

01:13:42.586 --> 01:13:45.889
(pensive music)

01:13:45.989 --> 01:13:49.025
(footsteps plodding)

01:13:51.895 --> 01:13:53.630
Come on. Sun is down.

01:13:54.998 --> 01:13:56.232
We should leave.

01:13:57.701 --> 01:14:00.604
Just a small prayer for Morwen

01:14:00.704 --> 01:14:01.871
and for Seamus.

01:14:05.008 --> 01:14:08.377
- Seamus is dead
and in the dirt.

01:14:08.444 --> 01:14:09.212
I told you.

01:14:11.347 --> 01:14:13.382
Rotherham's men smashed his
head in, left him to die,

01:14:13.449 --> 01:14:16.886
and I don't want to
hear any more about him.

01:14:19.689 --> 01:14:24.093
- I thought it was the thieves
who split him neck to navel.

01:14:31.901 --> 01:14:35.071
- What does it matter,
Anne? Man's gone.

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:38.675
(pensive music)

01:14:38.775 --> 01:14:40.243
They found our camp.

01:14:42.378 --> 01:14:44.080
Seamus tried to fight.

01:14:47.250 --> 01:14:48.752
(air whooshing)

01:14:48.818 --> 01:14:50.286
And he was a fool.

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:55.124
Tell me.

01:14:56.893 --> 01:14:58.995
You must tell me the truth.

01:15:02.666 --> 01:15:03.299
Truth?

01:15:11.941 --> 01:15:14.143
I have always loved you, Anne.

01:15:15.278 --> 01:15:17.013
Do you not know that?

01:15:18.481 --> 01:15:21.117
And now you can be
mine, truly mine.

01:15:24.153 --> 01:15:27.791
We can leave Seamus
behind, his mother behind.

01:15:31.494 --> 01:15:33.630
Our lives are ours to live.

01:15:35.799 --> 01:15:38.134
We don't owe anyone anything.

01:15:41.605 --> 01:15:46.009
- Tell me the truth, or I
will never speak to you again.

01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:50.013
(pensive music continues)

01:15:57.721 --> 01:16:00.990
He changed while we was away.

01:16:05.461 --> 01:16:08.031
His ambition, it grew and grew,

01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:12.168
and he was unafraid.

01:16:12.235 --> 01:16:13.069
(clothes rustling)

01:16:13.169 --> 01:16:14.337

01:16:23.146 --> 01:16:24.180
an appetite.

01:16:25.682 --> 01:16:28.752

01:16:28.852 --> 01:16:32.922
(clothes rustling)
(Seamus gasping)

01:16:33.022 --> 01:16:34.724

01:16:34.824 --> 01:16:37.060
(bag rustling)

01:16:38.161 --> 01:16:40.029
What's wrong with you?

01:16:42.231 --> 01:16:43.099
Huh?

01:16:44.267 --> 01:16:45.969
(strap snaps)
(coins clinking)

01:16:48.037 --> 01:16:50.306
Scared of a dead man, huh?

01:19:07.710 --> 01:19:08.344
No.

01:19:09.913 --> 01:19:13.349
Seamus, don't.

01:19:16.820 --> 01:19:19.956
Seamus. (whimpering)

01:19:26.329 --> 01:19:28.231
(armor clattering)

01:19:33.837 --> 01:19:37.240
You came back to me. (sobbing)

01:19:45.181 --> 01:19:46.816
You came back to me.

01:19:49.085 --> 01:19:49.819
Ah, Seamus.

01:19:52.188 --> 01:19:53.990

01:20:34.730 --> 01:20:37.433
[Jago] I really had no choice.

(Anne exhales)
(pensive music)

01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:45.808
You left him behind.

01:20:47.410 --> 01:20:50.646
(sighs) I had no choice.

01:20:50.746 --> 01:20:52.515
(Anne exhales)

01:20:52.615 --> 01:20:54.517
Morwen was right.

01:20:54.617 --> 01:20:56.519
You always were a jealous boy.

01:20:56.619 --> 01:20:58.787
- Stay.
- Let go of me.

01:20:58.854 --> 01:21:00.689

01:21:31.654 --> 01:21:32.488
Father.

01:21:34.991 --> 01:21:35.558
Father?

Morwen, let me in.

01:22:19.702 --> 01:22:21.870
We, we are not safe here.

(door creaking)
(rain pattering)

01:22:26.075 --> 01:22:26.942

Anne, get it off.

01:23:01.144 --> 01:23:02.478
Anne, Anne, help.

01:23:05.448 --> 01:23:08.151
Help me. I can't get it off.

01:23:08.251 --> 01:23:09.752
Morwen.

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:13.489
- [Morwen] (groans)
Anne, please.

01:23:13.589 --> 01:23:16.092
- Are you trying to scare
me back into submission?

01:23:16.159 --> 01:23:18.127
[Morwen] Have pity on me.

01:23:18.227 --> 01:23:19.028
- So I come back to your side.
- I can't get it off.

01:23:19.128 --> 01:23:20.296
It hurts.

01:23:20.396 --> 01:23:21.864
You're being foolish.

01:23:21.964 --> 01:23:23.499
- [Morwen] No.
(fire roaring)

01:23:23.599 --> 01:23:25.101
(screams) No, it's
stuck, it's stuck.

01:23:25.168 --> 01:23:26.269
Horrible.
(fire roaring)

01:23:26.335 --> 01:23:27.603
Horrible, horrible.

01:23:27.670 --> 01:23:29.438
Get it off, get it off.

01:23:29.505 --> 01:23:33.176

- God, Anne, it's hurting me.

01:23:33.276 --> 01:23:37.480
(Morwen screaming)
(Anne gasping)

01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:38.514

Anne, Anne.

01:23:49.458 --> 01:23:50.893
Be still.

01:23:50.993 --> 01:23:52.361
- [Morwen] (screams)
No, I'm afraid.

01:23:52.461 --> 01:23:54.630
- There's nothing
to be afraid of.

01:23:54.697 --> 01:23:57.633

(Anne breathing heavily)

01:24:22.525 --> 01:24:24.660
Now you really are a demon.

01:24:26.662 --> 01:24:28.531
[Morwen] Forgive me.

01:24:31.033 --> 01:24:31.734
Forgive me.

01:24:34.537 --> 01:24:35.438
No way.

(voices whispering)
(pensive music continues)

01:26:48.371 --> 01:26:49.238

- Wait.
- What do you want?

01:27:38.354 --> 01:27:40.789
I was looking for you.

01:27:40.889 --> 01:27:42.558

01:27:56.905 --> 01:27:58.907
I will not be yours or hers.

01:28:01.744 --> 01:28:04.112
I don't belong to anyone.

01:28:07.950 --> 01:28:11.454
All your talk of demons, Anne,

01:28:11.554 --> 01:28:13.789
I'm not the one hurting you.

01:28:15.257 --> 01:28:17.960

01:29:04.339 --> 01:29:07.476
This will help you sleep.
(liquid sloshing)

01:29:07.576 --> 01:29:10.379
I'll be back before
the sun is down.
