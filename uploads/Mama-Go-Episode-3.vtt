WEBVTT

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:28.960
Take that! I'll teach you to pull my hair!

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.960
Take that for pulling my hair!

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.160
I'll teach you to pull my hair!

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.280
You're up to no good, are you?

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.600
I'll teach you to pull my hair!

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:34.479
I'll teach you to pull my hair!

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:35.000
Who are you?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.920
Let go of me!

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:37.240
Take that for pulling my hair!

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:38.320
Take that for pulling my hair!

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.119
Skipping school, not studying!

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:41.000
You're up to no good!

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.719
I'll teach you to pull my hair!

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.759
I hurt my back!

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:58.280
Why does it hurt so much?

00:00:59.320 --> 00:00:59.840
Oh my god!

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:00.520
Mom!

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:02.560
Are you okay?

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.880
My god.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.159
Why does it hurt so much in a dream?

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.079
This definitely isn't a dream.

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:06.840
Where did you get hurt?

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:08.040
It hurts so much.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.599
Where?

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:09.120
My back.

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:10.319
Which class are you in?

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.480
He... They... They were bullying a girl.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.280
They were hitting a girl.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.159
Let's go!

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:14.680
Don't run!

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.840
They were bullying a girl!

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:17.400
Don't run!

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.879
Run, run!

00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:18.799
Isn't this a dream?

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.319
Why run?

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.280
Don't... Don't run! Don't run!

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.040
Wait...

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:28.359
What... what is going on with me?

00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:30.680
Am I not dreaming?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.159
No one said it was a dream.

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.159
You said it yourself.

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:38.079
Wha...

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.079
What happened?

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:40.239
How did I become like this?

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:41.799
How did I become so young?

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:42.959
So wh... what exactly happened?

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:43.959
You have to tell me.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.120
How would I know?

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.120
So... so I'm not dreaming?

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.799
How did I change...

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.280
Become so... so young?

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:50.400
I'm not dreaming.

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:51.480
No... then... this...

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.439
Mom.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.200
Could it be the food you usually eat?

00:01:57.519 --> 00:01:58.879
Too many preservatives? In what you eat?

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.000
Causing...

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:01.920
You definitely know something. Speak!

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.840
I think...

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.439
Is it possible that...

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.800
It's the medicine from your treatment this time?

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.120
That medicine might have side effects.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.280
Achieving this cosmetic effect.

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:11.840
Where are you going? Where are you going?

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.560
I'm going to the hospital.

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:13.199
Why go to the hospital?

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:14.240
No, I need to get clear answers.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.240
What medicine? What side effects?

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.159
I have to ask the doctor!

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:16.680
Let me tell you...

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.840
Don't... don't go to the hospital. Don't go.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.080
Don't be impulsive!

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:21.719
Don't panic, don't be terrified.

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:22.960
Just calm down, okay?

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:24.520
Actually...

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.639
I gave...

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.280
I...

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.159
It hurts!

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.840
Let me see.

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:46.479
Mom.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.599
Mom.

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:48.759
You wait here.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.599
I'll go see where Doctor Xiaoyun is.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.240
Come back, come back, come back.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.800
Mom, let me tell you the truth.

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:56.120
Actually...

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:57.000
I...

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.800
Who are you?

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:03.520
Kong Xiaocan.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.080
You actually came back?

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Want to extort the hospital?

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:11.879
You didn't tell her, did you?

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:14.759
Kong Guifang.

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:18.400
Your smart, wonderful son Xiaocan...

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:20.520
stole from our laboratory...

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:21.360
the Secret Formula.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.280
And secretly gave you an injection.

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:25.199
As a result, your cancer was cured.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.039
Why?

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:27.439
I don't know either.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.039
Even your cells have rejuvenated.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.960
I'm giving you two choices now.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.199
One.

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:35.800
You tell people about this.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.240
You will be treated as a lab rat by the lab.

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:39.240
Be dissected.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.280
Experimented on day after day.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.280
Your son will become a prisoner and go to jail.

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:46.919
Two.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.400
Neither of us tells anyone about this.

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:50.080
And you...

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.400
Continue being a mom.

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:52.520
Live your life.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.800
Live your healthy, good life.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.039
We let this matter go.

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.599
Okay?

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:57.280
Two.

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:58.240
We choose two.

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:11.960
Nice sting.

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:13.599
Next time, you could actually sting...

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:17.759
Wait a moment. Giving you a shot.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.319
Kong Xiaocan.

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:25.279
Who told you to leak the secret?

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:28.480
Yes, I can enter if there's a door.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:30.120
Kong Xiaocan.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.360
That thick contract...

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:34.480
The confidentiality clause in black and white...

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.639
Can't you see it?

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:36.480
Wait a minute, Brother Ah Fu.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:37.319
I...

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.480
You...

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:41.560
You sent the bee to sting me?

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.680
That's right.

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:44.000
If I hadn't made the bee...

00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:45.800
sew that loose mouth of yours shut...

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:47.199
you would have caused even bigger trouble.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.319
Take off your pants.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.319
Are you crazy?

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.439
How can I give you a shot without taking off pants?

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.040
Hurry up.

00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:54.040
Okay, okay.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.360
I'm the crazy one.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.920
Haven't you seen those sci-fi movies?

00:04:57.519 --> 00:04:58.839
Is there a single Earthling...

00:04:58.839 --> 00:05:00.639
who is friendly to us alien beings?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.800
I reiterate once more.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.519
Are the pants off yet?

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:04.199
Taking them off right now.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.519
If you dare reveal my existence to anyone...

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.360
You will receive...

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:11.199
a very severe...

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:13.240
very severe punishment.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.240
Does that include my mom too?

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.680
Yes.

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:18.879
Not even your mom.

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:19.879
I'm leaving.

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:33.560
What are you doing?

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.959
Taking off my pants.

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:36.240
Take them off, off, off.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.920
Mom.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.360
Finding out you can restart your life...

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:11.279
actually makes you pretty happy, right?

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.279
Happy about what?

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.519
What do we do from now on?

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:16.519
You chose option two.

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:18.519
Well, I couldn't let you go to jail.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.680
You seemed pretty excited back there.

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:24.000
Didn't I think it was a dream?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.199
Just keep treating it as a dream then.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.519
How can I?

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:29.040
Can you make money or do anything in a dream?

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:32.000
Why are you always thinking about money?

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.360
Oh my god, what happened to this house?

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:44.560
Go clean it up right now.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.800
Cleaning.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.360
Then tell me, how can I go to work?

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.519
How do I make money?

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:53.399
How do I explain this to Auntie Niu and the others?

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.040
Oh god.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.079
I didn't put the bankbook back.

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:57.680
With how much my mom loves money,

00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:59.160
if she finds out I spent all the savings,

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:00.439
she'll tear the house down.

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:02.279
You definitely can't see Auntie Niu.

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:03.639
How do I explain you?

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:04.600
You don't need to worry about that.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.319
Leave it to me.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.319
I'll just...

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.160
tell them...

00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:08.360
you went abroad for treatment.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.480
You can't be Kong Guifang anymore anyway.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.800
I'll just say you're my cousin.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.879
You really just make things up on the spot.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.639
You lie without even blinking.

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:19.519
I haven't even settled the score for you skipping school and lying to me.

00:07:19.519 --> 00:07:20.680
Why are you bringing me up again?

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.279
Don't talk about me right now.

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:23.839
Right now, you...

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:25.040
move the flowers to the balcony for me.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:30.720
I know.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.199
It's a bit hard for you to accept right now.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.319
But actually, if you look at it,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.480
your illness is cured,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.920
and you've become young again.

00:07:39.399 --> 00:07:39.800
Right?

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.000
Most people who get cosmetic procedures

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.480
can't achieve results like yours.

00:07:42.519 --> 00:07:43.879
Since you're here, you might as well accept it.

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:45.759
Most people would be envious.

00:07:45.839 --> 00:07:47.160
Besides, I spent twenty-five...

00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:48.519
What did you spend?

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:50.519
Spend what money?

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:51.920
How much did you spend?

00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:52.680
Who spent... You...

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.000
Did my illness use up all the money?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:54.720
What? I said I spent...

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.279
Did my getting sick...

00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:56.360
make you spend all the family's money?

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:56.959
I'm asking you!

00:07:56.959 --> 00:07:57.839
Why won't you say... Listen to me finish!

00:07:57.839 --> 00:07:59.199
I said I spent twenty-five yuan.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.199
I bought you an online fortune telling.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.360
They said it was the best luck.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.759
A good sign. A blessing in disguise.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.800
It won't scan.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.720
You look different now.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:10.959
Why can't this mobile banking app

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:12.439
recognize my face anymore?

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.680
Please visit a branch to update ID info.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.240
Let me tell you,

00:08:16.399 --> 00:08:17.600
you're too impatient right now.

00:08:18.079 --> 00:08:19.199
You finally became young again.

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:20.040
Don't be so restless.

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:21.959
Just relax a bit, okay?

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:22.759
It wasn't easy to get here.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.120
Enjoy your life properly.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.319
Tomorrow or an accident,

00:08:25.319 --> 00:08:26.519
you never know which comes first. You...

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.199
Where are you going?

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.240
Checking the accounts.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.879
What for? Checking accounts? Aren't you tired?

00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:33.039
You just got home, rest a while.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.240
The bank needs to rest too.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.200
I'm dead, I'm dead.

00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:40.360
Darn... darn... I'm done for... darn.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.320
Because of the problem with your face,

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.679
we can't process this for you.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.840
Since your face has been updated,

00:08:55.919 --> 00:08:58.000
shouldn't you update your ID card too?

00:08:59.159 --> 00:09:00.200
Li Wai! Li Wai! Quick, quick!

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.080
Help! Help! Help!

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.000
Darn it, someone's gonna die! Someone's gonna die!

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
You broke up with Sister Rui?

00:09:03.519 --> 00:09:04.799
Why didn't you tell me such big news?

00:09:05.039 --> 00:09:06.080
No, no.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.720
Let's sit up straight and look forward.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.240
Come on. Three, two, one.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.039
Lend me money. I need to borrow money. You have to lend me some.

00:09:13.399 --> 00:09:13.879
How much?

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:14.919
The more, the better.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:18.720
Excuse me.

00:09:18.879 --> 00:09:19.679
Please scan your fingerprint.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:21.519
Thank you.

00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:24.919
Thank you.

00:09:26.799 --> 00:09:27.519
Is one thousand enough?

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:28.679
You... at least...

00:09:28.679 --> 00:09:29.639
lend me a hundred thousand first.

00:09:29.879 --> 00:09:31.440
Get lost. Do I look like a hundred thousand?

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.879
Your current balance is...

00:09:33.879 --> 00:09:34.200
Hello?

00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:38.919
135,358.

00:09:40.519 --> 00:09:41.799
It's about the same as before I was hospitalized.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.200
Xiaocan didn't lie to me.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.000
I didn't expect you really weren't bluffing me.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.039
Mom was wrong to blame you.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:50.840
Oh my god.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.679
I only borrowed it for a short while, and they deducted so much?

00:10:10.799 --> 00:10:11.120
I...

00:10:12.639 --> 00:10:13.039
I...

00:10:18.559 --> 00:10:19.440
Excuse me, coming through.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.399
Mac.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
How was my performance?

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.639
It was okay, okay, okay.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.120
Come on, come on, take off the clothes.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.679
Like this?

00:10:37.919 --> 00:10:38.519
Come on, turn around.

00:10:38.639 --> 00:10:39.559
Turn around, turn around, turn around.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.360
Hands down, and back.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.320
Forty-five degrees.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.840
This way, the clothes won't wrinkle easily.

00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:48.000
There's a seven-day return policy. Come on.

00:10:48.399 --> 00:10:50.360
The watch, ring, and necklace.

00:10:50.799 --> 00:10:51.679
Let me, let me, let me.

00:10:51.919 --> 00:10:52.679
You're so clumsy.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:53.840
You're going to break them.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:56.720
Change into your own clothes.

00:10:57.759 --> 00:10:58.799
Let me tell you this one more time.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.039
From now on, you must speak standard Mandarin to me.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.840
You'll run into a lot of situations like this in the future.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.679
The key is to talk less.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.279
Besides, we've established a cool and aloof persona for you.

00:11:09.279 --> 00:11:09.960
Do you understand?

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:10.840
I understand, bro.

00:11:12.279 --> 00:11:12.879
I understand, bro.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:15.840
What I mean is,

00:11:17.639 --> 00:11:19.399
there weren't that many people today.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.919
In the future, there will be more and more.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.519
If they crowd you, just dodge them.

00:11:22.519 --> 00:11:24.080
If you fall, let someone help you up.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.320
But the most important thing is not to talk.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:25.879
The moment you open your mouth,

00:11:25.879 --> 00:11:27.279
calling people "big sis" or "little sis"...

00:11:27.279 --> 00:11:29.080
it's just too provincial. Too provincial.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.320
The kid really needs to practice her Mandarin.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.200
Those clothes of yours...

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.200
Hang them up properly for me.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.639
Don't wrinkle them, I have to return them.

00:11:34.799 --> 00:11:35.559
Right, right, right.

00:11:35.559 --> 00:11:36.039
And then,

00:11:36.039 --> 00:11:37.080
to your fans,

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.080
just say "Goodbye, princesses," and that's it.

00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:40.200
Goodbye, princesses.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.320
Not a word more, no, no, no.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.240
In the future, if you want to change your persona or something,

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.440
I'll hire a plant for you.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.320
We can stage a whole "hero saves the damsel" scene.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:46.879
That's not a problem either.

00:11:47.159 --> 00:11:47.600
Oh, right, bro.

00:11:48.759 --> 00:11:50.799
You said you'd help me find a cram school.

00:11:50.879 --> 00:11:51.840
It's been so long since I signed up.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.039
I've been in the city for two months already.

00:11:53.039 --> 00:11:53.879
When can I finally go?

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:54.840
Alright, alright, alright.

00:11:55.679 --> 00:11:57.399
Let's just finish the work we have on our hands,

00:11:57.399 --> 00:11:58.519
and then you can go to class, okay?

00:11:58.919 --> 00:11:59.320
Okay.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.000
In a bit, I'll take you to the place you'll be staying.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.559
You can't keep staying at my place forever.

00:12:04.799 --> 00:12:05.240
Right?

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.279
Thank you so much, Mac.

00:12:07.799 --> 00:12:08.840
You brought me to the city to make money,

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.399
and you're even helping me find a place.

00:12:11.039 --> 00:12:11.399
First of all,

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:12.679
it's not "Maizi."

00:12:12.759 --> 00:12:13.679
It's Mac.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.159
Mac. C.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:16.879
C. Got it?

00:12:17.759 --> 00:12:18.360
From now on,

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.399
you just work hard with me.

00:12:20.759 --> 00:12:21.519
Do a good job at the events.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.159
We'll make money together.

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.919
I'll treat you better and better in the future, don't you worry.

00:12:25.399 --> 00:12:26.159
Okay, Mac.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.240
You're my benefactor.

00:12:29.679 --> 00:12:30.480
Okay, okay.

00:12:32.639 --> 00:12:35.080
I picked this residential complex especially for you.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.039
It's almost entirely old men and old ladies.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.679
The chance of a fan club emerging from this demographic...

00:12:41.039 --> 00:12:41.759
is basically zero.

00:12:42.799 --> 00:12:44.200
But you're famous now.

00:12:44.279 --> 00:12:45.600
So your safety awareness has to keep up.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:46.559
Come on.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:47.840
Let's see your new home.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:57.159
How is it?

00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.039
Look.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:00.480
Kitchen.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.159
Gas.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.240
Induction.

00:13:03.919 --> 00:13:04.679
You don't cook anyway.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.080
Come, this is the bathroom.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.879
A 90% new toilet, and...

00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:12.879
this non-partitioned bathroom.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.120
This is the living room.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.360
Mattress, AC.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.159
Scenic balcony.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.360
It has everything it should.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.240
The design concept of this house...

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.799
maximizes the preservation of its original look.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.279
Texture and style.

00:13:27.639 --> 00:13:28.919
It's the most popular style right now.

00:13:28.919 --> 00:13:30.720
Nordic industrial minimalist style.

00:13:32.159 --> 00:13:32.879
Anyway, you...

00:13:34.639 --> 00:13:35.440
You, you... don't...

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.360
It's definitely not fully furnished yet.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.039
So don't get upset.

00:13:40.679 --> 00:13:41.879
This house is great.

00:13:41.879 --> 00:13:42.960
No alkali stains at all.

00:13:43.519 --> 00:13:44.840
It even has an AC and a toilet.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.519
I love this place so much.

00:13:46.519 --> 00:13:47.320
Thanks, Mac.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:51.759
Here.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:53.720
It's mine.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:54.720
It's yours.

00:13:55.639 --> 00:13:58.159
I'll find you some furniture at the used market.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:58.919
Thanks, Mac.

00:14:00.399 --> 00:14:00.919
Mac.

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:02.320
Thanks, Mac.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:03.759
Take care.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:04.919
Try not to go out.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.480
If you do go out, wear a hat.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.440
Hat, mask, things like that.

00:14:08.159 --> 00:14:08.960
Bye, Mac.

00:14:16.399 --> 00:14:16.879
Toilet.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:42.440
Auntie Niu

00:14:42.559 --> 00:14:44.480
Anyway, that's the situation

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.320
My mom is abroad right now

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.519
Under professional medical care

00:14:48.799 --> 00:14:50.120
She's getting better

00:14:50.399 --> 00:14:51.879
My real aunt, my real aunt

00:14:51.919 --> 00:14:52.240
No

00:14:52.759 --> 00:14:53.799
We just haven't been in touch for a long time

00:14:53.799 --> 00:14:55.120
My mom probably didn't mention her. You forgot?

00:14:55.399 --> 00:14:56.960
Please take care of things at the neighborhood committee

00:14:57.559 --> 00:14:59.320
When... when she comes back and is better

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.080
I'll arrange it

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.200
We'll have a good get-together and visit you

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:02.679
Thanks for your trouble, Auntie Niu

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.360
Okay, okay

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.320
Oh my god

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:13.519
You're back

00:15:14.799 --> 00:15:15.159
Look

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.279
ID card

00:15:18.879 --> 00:15:19.759
It's a temporary one

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.399
I got it done

00:15:21.759 --> 00:15:23.440
No, but how did they just issue it to you?

00:15:23.759 --> 00:15:25.799
I just told the police officer I had plastic surgery

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.120
And anyway, the way I look now

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.200
Compared to my ID from twenty years ago

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.080
Looks exactly the same

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.519
And the fingerprints haven't changed

00:15:30.879 --> 00:15:31.320
See?

00:15:31.879 --> 00:15:33.360
This is all going too smoothly

00:15:33.639 --> 00:15:34.919
They accepted it, right?

00:15:34.919 --> 00:15:36.399
It's a big world, anything is possible

00:15:36.679 --> 00:15:38.080
So you... you should just accept it too

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.360
The past is in the past

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.799
Just accept your new identity

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:41.840
Cousin

00:15:42.639 --> 00:15:43.559
I am your mother

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.840
You have no manners

00:15:45.399 --> 00:15:46.080
Mom, I'm hungry

00:15:46.159 --> 00:15:47.000
Let's eat, let's eat

00:15:47.759 --> 00:15:48.759
Wait, I'll cook for you

00:15:50.039 --> 00:15:51.679
Tidy up this room for me

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.879
I've been gone so long and you haven't moved

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.440
I know, stop nagging

00:15:55.679 --> 00:15:57.120
With your mouth like that, you can't eat much, right?

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.000
I'll cook you some noodles

00:16:01.279 --> 00:16:02.080
Bro, are you home?

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.399
I'm downstairs at your place

00:16:03.879 --> 00:16:04.440
Let me tell you

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.600
Xu Rui is really angry this time

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.000
I explained your family situation to her

00:16:08.559 --> 00:16:10.039
I know you don't really want to break up

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.360
But you can't just... whenever something happens

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.200
Think about pushing people away, you know?

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.360
You know that son of the Kong family

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.080
You two really need to talk this time

00:16:15.159 --> 00:16:16.759
Truly an unfilial son

00:16:17.039 --> 00:16:19.039
His mom has only been gone a few days

00:16:19.399 --> 00:16:21.320
And he brought that girl to live together

00:16:21.679 --> 00:16:22.639
Gone so fast

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.480
Pancreatic cancer, it's fast

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.320
Even the ancients knew

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.960
When mom dies, you mourn for three years

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:28.679
Right? That's right

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.120
This guy

00:16:30.759 --> 00:16:31.279
I think

00:16:31.279 --> 00:16:32.320
By this time next year

00:16:32.559 --> 00:16:33.519
The baby will be out

00:16:33.919 --> 00:16:36.200
It'll be a happy family of three again

00:16:36.559 --> 00:16:37.039
Kong Xiaocan

00:16:37.039 --> 00:16:38.039
Unfilial son

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.320
Your uncle!

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.279
Old Man Li?

00:16:42.639 --> 00:16:44.759
They said "your uncle"

00:16:44.799 --> 00:16:46.279
Not "Uncle Li"

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:48.759
Kong Xiaocan

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:49.960
Open the door, Kong Xiaocan

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.399
Open up, quick

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:52.919
I know you're home

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:53.759
Kong Xiaocan

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:54.720
Open the door

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.360
Aren't you disturbing the peace?

00:16:56.559 --> 00:16:56.960
Kong Xiaocan

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:57.320
What are you doing?

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:57.799
I'm asking you

00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.000
When did my Godmother pass away?

00:16:59.320 --> 00:16:59.679
What?

00:16:59.679 --> 00:17:00.519
Who are you hiding in there?

00:17:00.879 --> 00:17:02.000
Come out! Who is it?

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:02.519
Keep your voice down

00:17:02.519 --> 00:17:03.039
Come out here

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.480
What do you mean your Godmother is gone?

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.240
Who is it? Hit him!

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.119
Who is she?

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:27.319
Kong Xiaocan, you scum.

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:28.359
You're two-timing scum.

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:29.200
Shut your mouth for a second.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.400
Who told you my mom is gone?

00:17:32.839 --> 00:17:33.480
Your neighbor.

00:17:34.359 --> 00:17:35.119
Said Mom just passed away,

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:36.640
and you two are having a baby.

00:17:36.799 --> 00:17:37.480
Which neighbor?

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.279
Are they crazy?

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:48.359
My big mouth.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:52.599
Little sister.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:53.960
You've got a way with words.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:55.400
Why are you cursing?

00:17:56.319 --> 00:17:57.359
You... didn't you curse too?

00:17:57.559 --> 00:17:58.400
Why can't I curse?

00:17:59.000 --> 00:17:59.359
I am your...

00:17:59.359 --> 00:18:00.640
No, no, no, cousin. You're my cousin.

00:18:01.279 --> 00:18:01.640
Cousin?

00:18:01.799 --> 00:18:02.920
Right, this is my cousin.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:03.720
Cousin.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:04.119
Oh, cousin.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:05.000
Cousin.

00:18:05.359 --> 00:18:06.640
Wait, let me explain everything one by one.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.720
First, my mom isn't gone.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.920
My mom went abroad for treatment.

00:18:10.519 --> 00:18:11.240
She's already better.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.400
She went to find my aunt abroad.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.079
And she...

00:18:14.559 --> 00:18:16.079
is my aunt's daughter.

00:18:16.359 --> 00:18:18.359
She's back in the country staying with us for a bit.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.160
Oh my god, you scared me to death.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:21.279
Okay, okay, okay.

00:18:21.279 --> 00:18:22.759
I'm relieved to know Godmother is okay.

00:18:22.759 --> 00:18:24.680
If my mom were gone, wouldn't I tell you?

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:25.000
Would I really...

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.839
I shouldn't have listened to those rumors.

00:18:26.839 --> 00:18:27.799
Exactly, what kind of person am I?

00:18:27.799 --> 00:18:28.640
They really talk nonsense.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:29.480
I'm sorry, cousin.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.359
I'm not usually like this.

00:18:30.599 --> 00:18:31.759
Usually, I'm actually quite...

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.079
I give up. My mouth hurts from talking.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.960
Uh, Kong Guifang.

00:18:49.559 --> 00:18:50.880
Listen, let me explain.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.000
That's a great name.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.119
Retro.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:56.599
I like it.

00:18:57.359 --> 00:18:58.119
So you...

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.400
Haven't you heard of Kong Guifang?

00:19:06.079 --> 00:19:06.720
I have.

00:19:07.559 --> 00:19:08.759
Cousin Kong Guifang, right?

00:19:08.759 --> 00:19:09.720
He mentions you all the time.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.599
Your cousin is a great guy.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.559
Uh, did you see anything else?

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:13.319
I did.

00:19:14.359 --> 00:19:15.960
May 11th birthday. Taurus.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.359
We're a perfect match.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.599
Let's check our compatibility later.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.720
Let me introduce myself.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:24.880
Hello.

00:19:26.119 --> 00:19:26.680
I'm Li Wai.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:27.319
You go wait outside.

00:19:27.319 --> 00:19:28.359
I'm Xiaocan's best friend.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:28.799
Get out.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.640
We grew up together.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.680
Get out. You go out first. Out.

00:19:32.279 --> 00:19:32.599
Cousin.

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:34.480
Let me tell you.

00:19:34.839 --> 00:19:35.759
About me borrowing money.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:38.559
You must not tell my cousin.

00:19:39.079 --> 00:19:40.200
Because if you tell her,

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:40.920
she'll tell her mom.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:41.880
Her mom will tell my mom.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.680
Then my mom won't be able to focus on treatment.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.000
Fine.

00:19:46.559 --> 00:19:47.119
So,

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.200
buddy.

00:19:48.759 --> 00:19:49.359
Let me ask you something.

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:50.839
Your cousin,

00:19:52.519 --> 00:19:53.680
does she have a boyfriend?

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.279
You've got some nerve.

00:19:56.279 --> 00:19:57.079
I'm warning you.

00:19:57.519 --> 00:19:58.920
Don't get any ideas about my cousin.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:19:59.640
If you dare try,

00:19:59.799 --> 00:20:00.559
we're done.

00:20:00.759 --> 00:20:01.359
Is it that serious? Why?

00:20:01.599 --> 00:20:02.319
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

00:20:02.319 --> 00:20:03.079
But she's a widow.

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:03.799
She's bad luck for husbands.

00:20:03.839 --> 00:20:04.480
You two aren't a match.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.519
You're full of crap.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.680
I... I... Let me in.

00:20:07.519 --> 00:20:08.000
I need a drink of water.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
If you dare, we're through.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.079
Don't even think about it.

00:20:11.319 --> 00:20:12.079
What are you doing here?

00:20:13.359 --> 00:20:13.680
I...

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:14.720
I forgot about that.

00:20:14.839 --> 00:20:15.400
Listen to me.

00:20:15.519 --> 00:20:16.799
Go apologize to Xu Rui right now.

00:20:17.079 --> 00:20:18.359
She's given you a way out.

00:20:18.359 --> 00:20:19.640
You need to take it, you know?

00:20:20.799 --> 00:20:21.640
I know. Stay out of it.

00:20:21.839 --> 00:20:22.359
Wait a minute.

00:20:22.599 --> 00:20:24.039
What happened to your mouth?

00:20:24.039 --> 00:20:24.799
Is it really inflammation?

00:20:25.359 --> 00:20:26.039
It's karma.

00:20:26.519 --> 00:20:27.200
Fresh lip fillers.

00:20:28.519 --> 00:20:29.160
Spent half the money.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.079
Go home and fill the other half.

00:20:33.039 --> 00:20:34.240
Take good care of your cousin, okay?

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.200
Make her feel at home.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:43.559
Where's Li Wai?

00:20:44.319 --> 00:20:45.000
He went home.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:45.839
Went home to eat.

00:20:46.319 --> 00:20:47.279
That brat.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.720
Didn't even remember my name.

00:20:48.759 --> 00:20:50.200
I washed his undies for nothing when he was little.

00:20:50.359 --> 00:20:51.599
Good thing he didn't remember.

00:20:51.799 --> 00:20:52.599
We almost got busted.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:53.920
But it's normal.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.519
He called you Auntie Kong when he was little.

00:20:55.519 --> 00:20:56.319
Later he called you Godmother.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:57.960
I don't know his mom's name either.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:58.960
I just call her Auntie Wang.

00:20:59.119 --> 00:20:59.880
And you.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.039
Why call me "cousin"?

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.839
If anything, call me "older cousin".

00:21:03.359 --> 00:21:03.759
You...

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.359
You almost slipped up just now.

00:21:05.359 --> 00:21:06.160
I was covering for you.

00:21:06.559 --> 00:21:07.319
It's too late now.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.559
It's "cousin". It's already public.

00:21:11.799 --> 00:21:13.000
Wash your hands. Get ready to eat.

00:21:21.559 --> 00:21:22.240
Mom, I gotta say,

00:21:23.079 --> 00:21:24.119
this ointment works pretty well.

00:21:24.119 --> 00:21:25.319
It's not as swollen now, is it?

00:21:27.359 --> 00:21:27.920
What are you doing?

00:21:28.799 --> 00:21:30.240
You're not really thinking of looking for a job tomorrow, are you?

00:21:30.599 --> 00:21:31.279
What else should I do?

00:21:32.119 --> 00:21:32.720
If I don't go make money,

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:33.880
do you expect money to grow on trees?

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.960
If my mom starts earning money for the family again now,

00:21:43.559 --> 00:21:46.160
she'll continue to burn herself out in the kitchen,

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.200
continue to keep the house spotless,

00:21:49.359 --> 00:21:51.519
continue to raise that bunch of little brats

00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:53.079
until they're green and chubby.

00:21:53.279 --> 00:21:54.160
She might even...

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.079
become a mother all over again.

00:21:57.079 --> 00:21:57.680
Xiaocan, come here!

00:21:57.799 --> 00:21:58.759
Come play with your little brother!

00:21:58.759 --> 00:22:00.599
Your brother is crying, come comfort him!

00:22:00.599 --> 00:22:01.440
Kong Xiaocan, are you leaving or not?

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.119
Your brother keeps crying!

00:22:02.119 --> 00:22:03.319
You won't comfort him, so get out!

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.759
Twenty-five years in exchange for this?

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:08.839
No way.

00:22:10.799 --> 00:22:11.319
No way, no way.

00:22:19.839 --> 00:22:20.240
Mom.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.359
Didn't you say you wanted to go to school?

00:22:24.359 --> 00:22:25.799
I thought I was dreaming back then.

00:22:26.519 --> 00:22:27.359
I was just talking nonsense.

00:22:28.119 --> 00:22:29.000
Well, I took it seriously.

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:30.759
I made a decision for you.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.039
Go study.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:33.640
Take the college entrance exam.

00:22:34.039 --> 00:22:34.599
Go to college.

00:22:35.839 --> 00:22:36.680
What nonsense are you spouting?

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.400
You should think about what we're going to do later.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.319
Stop worrying about the sky falling.

00:22:41.319 --> 00:22:42.079
What "later"?

00:22:42.079 --> 00:22:43.440
People live in the moment nowadays.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.359
Carpe diem.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.079
Besides,

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.599
it's not like our family has no money.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.119
You just say whatever comes to your mind.

00:22:48.119 --> 00:22:49.279
Where... where does this family have money?

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.000
It's not like we can't survive.

00:22:51.119 --> 00:22:52.480
But we literally can't survive!

00:22:53.359 --> 00:22:54.880
If worse comes to worst, I'll do a work-study program.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.680
You're full of... You can work?

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.079
When the time comes, the two of us,

00:22:59.519 --> 00:23:01.400
will walk into campus hand in hand.

00:23:01.559 --> 00:23:02.079
Work together.

00:23:02.079 --> 00:23:02.799
Think about it carefully.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.079
Going to school with your parent.

00:23:07.319 --> 00:23:09.480
Walking into campus with your son.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:28.640
Right?

00:23:29.319 --> 00:23:31.440
Getting into college isn't as hard as it used to be.

00:23:31.559 --> 00:23:32.920
And tuition isn't that expensive either.

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.000
Don't feel burdened.

00:23:34.279 --> 00:23:34.920
Unless...

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:36.880
Unless what?

00:23:37.839 --> 00:23:38.480
You're chicken.

00:23:39.039 --> 00:23:39.640
You don't dare.

00:23:40.559 --> 00:23:42.119
You used to brag all the time and call me dumb.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.680
Saying you didn't have the chance back then.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.480
That you didn't have the means.

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.799
Otherwise, you would've definitely gotten into a top university.

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.279
Well, the opportunity is right in front of you now.

00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:48.519
Are you afraid your brain is too slow?

00:23:48.799 --> 00:23:49.400
That you can't learn anything?

00:23:49.559 --> 00:23:50.839
That you'll fail the exam and lose face?

00:23:50.839 --> 00:23:51.880
And won't be able to brag to me anymore?

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:52.599
You're just escaping reality.

00:23:52.599 --> 00:23:53.599
You... you are a coward.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:55.440
A cowardess.

00:23:55.599 --> 00:23:56.440
A sticky rice woman.

00:23:57.759 --> 00:23:58.359
I hit the mark, didn't I?

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.599
If I'm right, there's only one way

00:24:00.599 --> 00:24:01.759
to slap me in the face and prove me wrong.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:03.319
That is to take the exam.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:04.400
And pass it.

00:24:08.559 --> 00:24:09.680
I'm speaking to you seriously.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.400
You finally managed

00:24:11.799 --> 00:24:13.079
to live life over again.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.400
Shouldn't you think about yourself for once?

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:16.400
Kong Guifang.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:19.480
No respect for your elders.

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:20.960
Don't...

00:24:24.599 --> 00:24:25.200
Hurry up and...

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.319
return Zhang Chi's clothes.

00:24:28.279 --> 00:24:29.400
It's happily decided then.

00:24:40.599 --> 00:24:42.079
You, you, you, hold this for me.

00:24:45.119 --> 00:24:46.160
Why do you have to do this?

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.319
Can't you just give it back directly?

00:24:47.839 --> 00:24:48.480
How am I supposed to return it?

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.160
Your mom, I'm wearing an armband...

00:24:50.559 --> 00:24:51.519
...and then going to see your Auntie Zhang?

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:52.720
Don't I have any dignity?

00:24:52.839 --> 00:24:53.400
Why wear an armband?

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.440
You're still wearing the armband? Don't.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:55.920
You can't go back to the neighborhood committee.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.680
Besides, Auntie Zhang doesn't know what you look like now.

00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.200
Shut up. Hold the pole.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.680
You don't believe me anyway.

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:01.920
I don't want to go anymore either.

00:25:02.359 --> 00:25:03.359
I'd rather help you sell beef pancakes.

00:25:03.359 --> 00:25:04.160
Sell what pancakes?

00:25:04.319 --> 00:25:05.720
The cart was confiscated by the committee.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.160
Then I'll steal it back for you.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.160
You child...

00:25:09.319 --> 00:25:10.759
Can't you have some ambition?

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:11.680
Like me...

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.880
What's good about selling beef pancakes all your life?

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.839
I don't want you to end up like me.

00:25:17.319 --> 00:25:17.799
I don't want that either.

00:25:17.799 --> 00:25:19.079
Seeing you work from dawn to dusk every day.

00:25:19.319 --> 00:25:20.400
If you really want what's best for me...

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.000
...then go study hard for me.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.200
Don't get into fights.

00:25:24.039 --> 00:25:25.319
Do you believe me or not?

00:25:25.759 --> 00:25:26.799
I really didn't fight.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:28.359
I can testify.

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.119
He really didn't fight.

00:25:30.119 --> 00:25:30.920
Someone was bullying him.

00:25:31.319 --> 00:25:31.799
Heroine.

00:25:32.279 --> 00:25:33.000
I... I can testify too.

00:25:34.079 --> 00:25:34.799
Brother Xiaocan.

00:25:35.279 --> 00:25:36.039
See? I told you.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.920
They really stole my school uniform.

00:25:40.279 --> 00:25:40.759
Xiaocan.

00:25:41.559 --> 00:25:41.920
Auntie Zhang.

00:25:42.279 --> 00:25:43.359
What are you doing here?

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:44.279
I was just...

00:25:44.839 --> 00:25:45.839
How is your mom doing?

00:25:46.759 --> 00:25:47.680
My mom...

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:50.200
You should believe your son.

00:25:50.599 --> 00:25:51.920
He really is a good kid.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:55.400
Xiao Chi, Xiao Chi.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.319
You study hard, okay?

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.440
You're a good kid.

00:25:57.559 --> 00:25:58.920
Yeah, this... this Zhang Chi is actually pretty good.

00:26:00.519 --> 00:26:01.000
Heroine.

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.640
Heroine, what's your name?

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:05.519
This...

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:15.640
Didn't change back.

00:26:21.799 --> 00:26:22.720
Xiaocan was right.

00:26:23.599 --> 00:26:24.599
Since I've become young...

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.400
...I should act like a young person.

00:26:27.279 --> 00:26:28.160
Doing some jerk things...

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.039
...should be fine, right?

00:26:30.839 --> 00:26:31.400
Kong Xiaocan.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:32.960
Hurry up, get out of bed.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:33.839
Come out with me.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:51.599
Auntie Niu

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.240
You scared me to death

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.440
My poor little heart

00:26:55.599 --> 00:26:56.160
You're looking pretty again

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:56.960
Your little heart?

00:26:57.039 --> 00:26:57.839
Look at that hairstyle

00:26:58.920 --> 00:26:59.480
So

00:26:59.559 --> 00:27:01.279
Didn't go inspect the market today?

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.839
On duty by yourself again?

00:27:03.079 --> 00:27:03.599
So

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:04.759
You're back

00:27:05.359 --> 00:27:07.480
When are you going back to your Belgium?

00:27:08.759 --> 00:27:09.519
Look at you saying that

00:27:09.519 --> 00:27:10.400
Others mock me

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.400
are you laughing at me too?

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:12.640
You kid

00:27:12.759 --> 00:27:14.400
You almost angered your mom to death

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.839
How is your mom's health now?

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:18.920
My mom is just

00:27:21.799 --> 00:27:23.079
a bit too good

00:27:23.599 --> 00:27:25.039
She can ride a three-wheeler on two wheels

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:26.559
So much energy

00:27:26.759 --> 00:27:27.799
Strength to move mountains

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:28.839
Strong as an ox

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:31.640
A powerhouse, my god

00:27:32.559 --> 00:27:34.240
You sound like a commercial

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.680
What are you doing here at my place?

00:27:36.119 --> 00:27:37.640
I'm helping my mom find... find something

00:27:38.039 --> 00:27:38.559
Find what?

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:39.440
Find

00:27:40.279 --> 00:27:40.920
Find some

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.079
Is it

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.440
what I asked your mom

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.839
to buy for me last time, that small fan?

00:27:44.839 --> 00:27:45.200
Yes, yes, yes

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:45.960
I think it's here

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.160
Not over there, at my mom's place

00:27:47.759 --> 00:27:49.279
You can take it back to your mom

00:27:49.279 --> 00:27:49.759
No need

00:27:49.759 --> 00:27:50.920
Stuff like this is expensive abroad

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:54.720
Oh my god

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:55.359
What's wrong?

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.640
You have a gray hair, Auntie Niu

00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:58.640
I'll pull it out for you

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.000
Nonsense, I just dyed it

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.440
Niu Meili, having gray hair isn't beautiful

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.880
Where is there gray hair? No, no

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:03.160
You

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.440
Don't touch my hair, listen to me

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:04.880
It's right here

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:05.359
Don't move

00:28:08.039 --> 00:28:08.519
Right here

00:28:08.519 --> 00:28:09.279
Don't move, don't move

00:28:09.319 --> 00:28:10.839
Let me dig, dig, dig

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:12.000
See? Isn't it?

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:12.640
Don't move

00:28:14.519 --> 00:28:16.079
What are you doing? You kid

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.440
I spent all morning on this

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.920
Why are you pulling it out?

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:19.599
All morning

00:28:19.599 --> 00:28:20.519
I forgot what my mom wanted

00:28:20.519 --> 00:28:21.279
I'll ask her later. No, you...

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:22.680
Auntie Niu, didn't you...

00:28:22.839 --> 00:28:24.400
This is trendy. Don't wear that fake...

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.359
Granny gray is awesome

00:28:25.599 --> 00:28:27.519
You're so annoying. Look at this

00:28:28.039 --> 00:28:28.720
Mom, Mom, Mom

00:28:36.599 --> 00:28:37.119
Go, go

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:42.920
Did you pedal? Push!

00:28:44.119 --> 00:28:45.160
Push!

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.839
I'm pushing hard! Keep it down

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.200
Hurry up

00:28:48.279 --> 00:28:49.400
Did you pedal?

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.519
Did you pedal? Push!

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.319
Put some effort into it! Push!

00:29:12.279 --> 00:29:12.640
Mom

00:29:13.119 --> 00:29:13.759
Go to school

00:29:14.519 --> 00:29:15.000
What?

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:16.640
I said,

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:17.960
go to school

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.839
Why did you bring me here?

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.200
To start from the top.

00:30:11.519 --> 00:30:12.160
Hello there.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.480
How would you like it cut?

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:16.559
Sir.

00:30:16.599 --> 00:30:17.599
Could you just make it...

00:30:17.799 --> 00:30:18.960
as chic and pretty as possible.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:19.799
Style it for her.

00:30:19.839 --> 00:30:21.039
Let me think.

00:30:21.119 --> 00:30:21.599
The main thing is...

00:30:21.599 --> 00:30:22.839
she doesn't usually style her hair.

00:30:22.839 --> 00:30:24.799
She's never had styling or a hairdo.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:25.359
Anyway, just...

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.039
see if you can give her big waves.

00:30:27.079 --> 00:30:27.960
Right, Tony?

00:30:28.319 --> 00:30:29.599
You don't need to dye it.

00:30:29.599 --> 00:30:30.720
What about those big curls?

00:30:30.799 --> 00:30:31.359
Let me look it up.

00:30:31.519 --> 00:30:32.160
Take a look.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:34.440
Is that a no?

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:35.640
Is that a no, Tony?

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:36.200
I can do it.

00:30:36.319 --> 00:30:37.000
Call me Kevin.

00:30:37.119 --> 00:30:37.839
Sorry, Kevin.

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.400
Just make it temporary.

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.039
But don't give her auntie curls.

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.240
My son is right.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.200
Live in the moment.

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.400
It's time to think about myself.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:47.720
It's just going to school.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.319
It's just restarting a life.

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:53.480
Let's start from the top.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:56.319
Look at you.

00:31:57.559 --> 00:31:59.079
You went from Xianghe

00:31:59.079 --> 00:32:00.599
straight to the Champs-Élysées.

00:32:01.079 --> 00:32:02.119
How is it, son?

00:32:02.359 --> 00:32:03.279
It's amazing.

00:32:03.279 --> 00:32:04.720
My cousin's fashion sense...

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:07.240
I'm your mother.

00:32:07.759 --> 00:32:08.359
Okay, okay, okay.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.440
It looks really good.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:21.759
Nineteen years old.

00:32:22.759 --> 00:32:24.440
Usually a quarter of one's life.

00:32:25.519 --> 00:32:26.480
Or a fifth.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.599
We always make life's most important decisions

00:32:31.759 --> 00:32:33.759
at our most immature age.

00:32:35.599 --> 00:32:36.119
Like me,

00:32:37.119 --> 00:32:37.799
Kong Xiaocan.

00:32:39.279 --> 00:32:40.279
Just starting my freshman year,

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.440
I skipped school to go to a snow mountain without telling Mom.

00:32:43.559 --> 00:32:45.440
After learning Mom had a terminal illness,

00:32:46.559 --> 00:32:48.400
I shed tears of sincere regret.

00:32:49.319 --> 00:32:50.960
Then I made a deal with an alien being,

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.079
trading twenty-five years of my life

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:54.480
to give to Mom.

00:32:55.759 --> 00:32:56.960
Letting her regain her health

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:58.640
and return to her youth.

00:33:00.319 --> 00:33:01.079
And now,

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:03.119
I'm keeping another secret from her.

00:33:03.519 --> 00:33:04.960
Using the last of our family savings,

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.119
I signed her up for a cram school.

00:33:07.119 --> 00:33:08.519
The very last sprint class,

00:33:09.079 --> 00:33:10.680
to fulfill her dream of going to college.

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:12.400
From now on,

00:33:13.039 --> 00:33:14.680
I will shoulder the burden of our little family.

00:33:15.279 --> 00:33:15.799
At least,

00:33:16.599 --> 00:33:18.279
regarding Mom restarting her life...

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:19.480
I want to sign up.

00:33:19.799 --> 00:33:20.559
I have no regrets.

00:33:23.759 --> 00:33:24.400
I've thought it through.

00:33:25.519 --> 00:33:26.400
My goal

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.559
is to get into Duxing University.

00:33:29.759 --> 00:33:31.559
That way I can go to school with you.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:33.880
No...

00:33:34.759 --> 00:33:35.200
How about that?

00:33:35.599 --> 00:33:36.160
Happy?

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:39.319
Go over there to pick up materials.

00:33:39.759 --> 00:33:40.079
Okay.

00:33:41.759 --> 00:33:44.279
Why do you have to cling to me even for college?

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:55.319
If we were to select

00:33:55.319 --> 00:33:57.000
a ranking of filial sons in this world,

00:33:59.279 --> 00:34:00.640
he would certainly be at the top.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.920
This handsome man is named Kong Xiaocan.

00:34:07.759 --> 00:34:09.079
He is an ordinary son,

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:12.280
but also a young man with a heart full of great love.

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.679
Who says the heart of a blade of grass

00:34:17.119 --> 00:34:18.320
can repay the warmth of the spring sun?

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:22.800
Countless poems praise a mother's dedication to her child.

00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:25.480
But even the most flowery language

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:26.920
would struggle to describe

00:34:27.519 --> 00:34:29.519
this young man's dedication to his mother.

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:32.639
He gave up a colorful future,

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:35.559
but gained endless glory.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:45.519
Xiaocan.

00:34:50.079 --> 00:34:50.639
What are you watching?

00:34:51.559 --> 00:34:52.199
Just looking around.

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:02.760
At your age,

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:05.639
don't look at this nonsense.

00:35:06.159 --> 00:35:06.800
What nonsense am I looking at?

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:07.519
What's wrong with watching this?

00:35:07.519 --> 00:35:08.639
Why can't I watch this?

00:35:10.239 --> 00:35:11.199
Lots of people watch it.

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:12.679
It's... it's bad for your health.

00:35:14.039 --> 00:35:15.079
Don't be like those people.

00:35:16.559 --> 00:35:17.599
Drink... drink your milk.

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.960
Watching comedy shows is bad for your health.

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.400
Where did you hear that?

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:42.599
Xu Rui

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:45.679
When you see

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.679
this video,

00:35:48.719 --> 00:35:49.159
I

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:50.880
will be gone.

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.400
They say

00:35:54.239 --> 00:35:54.599
everyone

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:56.320
must die eventually.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:57.840
It may be

00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.239
heavier than Mount Tai.

00:35:59.679 --> 00:36:00.360
Want some fruit?

00:36:00.599 --> 00:36:02.519
What are you doing? What?

00:36:03.239 --> 00:36:04.159
Are you still watching that?

00:36:04.159 --> 00:36:05.039
I wasn't, I...

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.119
What are you hiding?

00:36:06.519 --> 00:36:07.599
Stop just barging in.

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.199
Can't you knock?

00:36:09.199 --> 00:36:10.320
I'm a grown man.

00:36:10.599 --> 00:36:11.760
I just want you to eat fruit.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:12.880
Is it my fault now?

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:13.800
Get out.

00:36:15.719 --> 00:36:16.519
Eat the fruit.

00:36:17.079 --> 00:36:17.480
Grandma.

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:20.199
She meddles in everything.

00:36:20.239 --> 00:36:21.280
Won't let me watch comedies.

00:36:28.719 --> 00:36:29.280
Or

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:30.800
lighter than a feather.

00:36:32.039 --> 00:36:32.679
And I

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:35.000
am stuck in the middle.
