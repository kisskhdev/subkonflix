00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.150
Based on your description,

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.360
she's probably afflicted with a mind-altering poison,

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.840
also known as Peach Blossom Stupor.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.750
It is a dangerous poison.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.240
Once the toxin enters the bones and marrow,

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.280
the victim will lose their mind.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.430
At midnight,

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.560
the victim will lose control and kill innocents.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.630
My medicine

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.400
can only suppress the poison in her briefly.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:53.870
If

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.190
there is no

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.560
peach blossom mark on her forehead,

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.080
she can yet be saved if you send her my way.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:05.960
But if there is a peach blossom mark

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.470
between the eyebrows?

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.470
If there is a peach blossom mark between the eyebrows,

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.960
then I'm afraid it is too late.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.870
Hurry and go back now.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.400

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:29.480
Is it

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.630
the antidote?

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.920
Where did you get it?

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.120
Don't worry about it.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.240
Just know

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.720
that you'll be cured after you take the medicine.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.950

What are you doing?

Who the mastermind is doesn't matter.

But searching blindly

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:13.190
is futile.
