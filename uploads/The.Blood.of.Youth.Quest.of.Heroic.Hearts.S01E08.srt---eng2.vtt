00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.000
The hour of Zi...

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.560
You there.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.680
Come here.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.080

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.750
Come here.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.190
Go.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.150
It seems like

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.470
we must deliver the wedding gown

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:42.960
before we can meet the Divine Maiden.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.000
Do you remember

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.800
how we first died?

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.560
When we entered the room, the Divine Maiden was already dead.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.910
This wedding gown

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.310
is like a death curse.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.470
Who wears white

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.150
on their wedding gown anyway?

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.590
But we can't possibly make another one.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.520
Weigui!

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.240

Remember.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.960
We're in a dream.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.120
Your will

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.800
might change certain things.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:28.430
You did it.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.910
You did it!

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.840

Divine Maiden.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.310
Great.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.190
You're alive.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.280
But your gown...

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.520
How come...

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.120
Where is the gown here?

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.680
You disturbed my bride.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.680
Die!

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.360
Wait.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.390
Divine Maiden.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.600
It's us.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.920
I'm Lei Lingze.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.160
Hush.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.070
You might summon the ox-head butcher.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.040
What are you doing here?

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.270
We were about to ask the same thing.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.070
What's going on here?

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.630
I have no idea.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.040
I was invited to Liuli Manor,

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.240
but I lost consciousness.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.270
And I woke up

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.600
to this wedding gown.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.510
We're stuck in a dream.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.510
It must be because of the miasma.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.630
I've always

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.190
wanted to ask you this question.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:06.600
Have we

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:07.680
met before?

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.160
No.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.830
Now is not the time for this.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.070
Let's find a way to escape.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.750
Do you know

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.310
any array or poison that, when combined with miasma,

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.480
can create a dream,

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.190
trapping

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.720
people inside

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.360
with no way of waking up?

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:29.680
No, I don't.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.360
Since this is a dream,

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.360
we just need to find a way

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.600
to get out of the dream.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.750
Let's go.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.310
You're finally here.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.630
Thank you

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.360
for finding my bride.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.720
My love,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.310
come to the hall with me.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:12.560
Impossible.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.240
If you won't marry me,

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.720
they will die.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.680
Divine Maiden will not marry you.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.750
How dare you!

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.510
Lei Lingze,

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.680
are you okay?

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.950
Take him down.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.830
Let's go.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:35.720
You

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.190
will run away from the marriage for them?

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.560
Even if you kill me,

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.560
I still won't let her marry you.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:45.600
Die!

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.270
If this is a dream,

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.480
there must be a pattern.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.070
I refused to go through with the wedding

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:04.950
and I was killed

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:06.680
by the ox-head butcher.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:10.750
It seems like in this dream,

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.000
you must get married

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.950
before we can leave.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.480
No.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:16.510
We can't let Divine Maiden

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.750
marry a monster like that.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.240
When push comes to shove,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.160
I'll fight them.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.240
But our inner force is gone.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.190
You can't use your thunderbolt bombs

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:28.040
to defend yourself either.

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:31.800
Perhaps

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.920
we can go through with the matrimonial ritual

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.070
before we find a way to escape.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.360
Don't worry, Divine Maiden.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.480
We

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.240
will do our best

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:46.160
to protect you.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:48.430
I will be cautious too.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.190
Thank you

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.070
for finding my bride.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.270
My love,

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.190
come to the hall with me.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.960
The auspicious hour is upon us.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.550
Gentle light fills the hall.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:53.670
What a match

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.670
made in heaven.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.840
Bride and groom,

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.200
please hold each other's hands

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.720
and enter this blessed hall.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.200
First bow to Heaven and Earth.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.790
Second bow to your ancestors.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.320
Bow to each other.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.270
The ritual is complete.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.960
You may now enter the bridal chamber.

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.630
Wait.

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:28.000
Right, I almost forgot about you here.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.320
You helped me find my bride,

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:32.870
and therefore, you shall be rewarded.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.200
Consider the Skysplitter fragment

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.510
your gift.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.630
This is the Skysplitter fragment?

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.870
My love, let's go.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.150
Wait.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:57.440
We would like

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:58.550
to speak with the bride.

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:02.120
That depends if she

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.030
wants to speak with you or not.

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:05.720
Divine Maiden.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:08.480
Divine Maiden.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.320
Do you have nothing to say to us?

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:15.550
Have you forgotten

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.440
what we agreed to do

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.670
once after you went through with the matrimonial ritual?

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:21.910
Enough of this.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.600
Or I'll have to take action.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:25.440
You...

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:26.000
What's going on?

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:26.750
What did you say?

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:27.720
Let's go.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:28.120
Run.

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:32.240
How dare you!

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.440
You won't get away!

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:52.960
How could you be so reckless

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:54.510
and take that hit?

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:56.320
Divine Maiden,

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:57.480
forgive me.

00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.840
I won't

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.200
be able to protect you again.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:02.870
Weigui.

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:04.440
Just go.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.670
I'll stall them for you.

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:07.390
Shut up.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.080
You can't die.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:10.510
Or at least,

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:11.670
not here.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:14.960
Now's not the time for this.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:15.750
Let's go.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.510
The most dangerous place

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:19.510
is the safest place.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.870
Let's go.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:21.480
Let's go.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.200
This is...

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.720
Where we always wake up.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.480
How can we escape from this dream?

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.630
[Death is Life]

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.030
Death is life?

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:56.870
What does it mean?

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:02.550
Could this be

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:04.480
the solution to the riddle?

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.320
Does that mean

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.440
if we die,

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.600
we can wake up from the dream?

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:16.120
No way.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.150
Weigui and I died several times.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.000
But we never woke up from the dream.

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:26.750
In those times,

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.670
we were killed by the ox-head butcher.

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:30.320
Perhaps

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.120
the way to wake up

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:33.150
is suicide?

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.240
Let's

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:44.510
try it.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.000
After you.
