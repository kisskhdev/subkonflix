Duan Jiuxiu, Elder Tianji

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.850
was already killed by my aunt.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:44.820
Uncle Zhou,

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.850
why is he still alive?

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:50.770
Zhizhen,

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:52.610
are you all right?

00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:54.462
(Young Zhou Zhizhen, Peiqiong Manor)
I'm fine.

00:01:54.473 --> 00:01:55.210
Pingshu is injured.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.894
(Young Zhou Zhiqin)
I'll escort her back.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.250
Be careful.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.860
Goodbye.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:07.820
Look carefully.

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:09.220
Leave no one alive.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.410
Yes.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.820
I have

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.980
the Ziwei Method.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.260
I am a member of the Six Sects.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.290
How could I collude
with the demonic sect?

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.170
Elder Tianji has long been dead.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.290
Zhao,

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.820
don't listen to his slander.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.260
At a time like this,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.340
what is there left to hide?

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.380
When you and Elder Tianji came to me,

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.100
you said that with the Ziwei Method,

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.850
we wouldn't have to be
anyone's lackey anymore

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.730
or do dirty, exhausting work.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.890
You even said
that Zhou Zhizhen wasn't better

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.540
than you in fighting or capability,

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.980
so why couldn't you become the lord?

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.060
You said

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.290
you'd unify

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.660
the Six Sects soon.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.500
Shut up.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.850
Mr. Zhou,

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.890
you're so foolish.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.850
Why would Elder Tianji pass
his martial arts to you?

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.243
If not to rope you in as an inside man
among the Six Sects,

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.410
that old jerk

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.500
would never have survived

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.690
in the Li Sect.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.010
How could he cultivate the Ziwei Method?

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:21.730
Once I leave,

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.940
I will surely report to the Chief.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.290
Cowardly scoundrel.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.060
Sowing discord.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.130
Master,

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.060
didn't we agree to practice in secret?

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.730
If you report to the Chief,

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.340
we won't be able to practice anymore.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.540
Uncle Jiu knew you harbored
ulterior motives.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.679
He had me keep an eye on you.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.540
You really thought I fancied you

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.660
and was willing to be your deputy?

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.900
You...

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:02.690
Zhao,

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.820
hand over the saliva.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.780
Our sects have been friends
for generations.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.410
You are also about to marry Yuqi.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.060
We will be family.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.100
Now,

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:13.850
I've lost my son.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.780
You and Yuqi are my children.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.660
We can cultivate
the Ziwei Method together

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.540
and bring glory to our sects.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.540
That way,

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.980
we won't have to be submissive

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.020
or be suppressed by other sects.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.100
That's right, young lady.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.140
I also admire Ms. Cai.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.100
Once the Method is perfected,

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.850
we can go out to uphold justice.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.370
That would not disgrace Ms. Cai's name.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:35.730
Right?

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:36.570
Zhao?

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:41.700
That makes sense.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:44.490
It's not impossible.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:47.770
Here you go.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.170
You're still alive.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.980
Your lover is dead.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.850
Of course, I'm still alive.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:07.980
Uncle Jiu.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.810
You're a junior.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.390
I won't make things hard for you.

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.100
Hand over the saliva,

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:18.660
and you may leave.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.540
Saliva in exchange for my life.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.100
That's not a bad deal.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.810
But this saliva

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.660
is only a little.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.340
Is it enough for the three of you?

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.930
No matter which one of you I give it to,

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.250
the other two

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.370
will harbor hatred toward me

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.700
and want me dead.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.250
Give it to me.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.410
They won't dare act rashly.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.410
I don't believe it.

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.540
Unless you kill them all.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:00.010
No.

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:01.980
What if you fake your deaths

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.730
and escape?

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:06.580
Wouldn't I suffer a huge loss?

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:08.580
What do you want?

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.220
I want you to cut off

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.610
Zhou Zhiqin's head.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.370
When his head is separated
from his body,

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.100
I will hand over the saliva.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:30.250
Cai Zhao,

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.660
have you lost your mind?

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.290
If not for you letting
that damned man escape,

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:36.020
so many people wouldn't have died.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.060
Go to the underworld
and atone for your sins.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:40.690
Elder Duan,

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.170
don't listen to her sowing discord.

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.610
As expected

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.140
of that vile Cai Pingshu,

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.410
raising such a vicious little wretch.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:51.690
Fine.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:53.540
Since you say that,

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:55.220
let's perish together.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.140
- Wait.
- No.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.220
Let's talk it out.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.490
Talk it out, huh?

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:00.370
Then will you speak properly?

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:01.980
From now on,

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.290
I don't want to hear a single word

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.100
disrespecting my aunt.

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:06.660
Uncle Jiu was just anxious.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.340
He didn't mean to slight your aunt.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:09.540
We won't say it anymore.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:10.380
We won't.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.490
Stop putting on airs before me.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:18.370
If I'm unhappy,

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.810
I can let go of the saliva,

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:21.900
but you

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:24.730
must die.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:25.660
Then die.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:26.500
No, no.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.700
Are you going to do it or not?

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:35.490
I'll count to three.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:36.620
One.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:38.690
Two.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:40.140
Three!

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:40.980
Fine.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.050
I agree.

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:48.130
Uncle Jiu.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:49.370
Qinong,

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:51.930
I'm old.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.730
I can't wait any longer.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.410
Don't blame me.

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:36.220
Young lady,

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:37.770
there's no way out.

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:39.610
Hand over the saliva,

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.370
and I'll let you go.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:45.540
Here you go.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.940
You wretch. I'll kill you.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:07.060
Why are you still here?

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:10.650
Jerk!

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:11.700
You're not dead?

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.280
You were waiting for me.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:14.450
How would I dare die?

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:15.540
Impossible.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.060
I saw you dragged away by the python.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.130
That's true.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.850
But the python hates heat.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:24.730
When my mindful way circulates,

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:25.850
my whole body heats up.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:27.530
So, the python let me go.

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:29.420
I was quite lucky.

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:31.770
I even met a friend.

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:43.300
Qian Xueshen?

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:49.730
Weren't you already...

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.060
He bribed Mr. Zhang
and swapped identities with him.

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:55.010
The one who died there was Mr. Zhang.

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:56.850
Normally, once a person dies,

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.100
the Body Shift will end.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:01.180
But the corpse was destroyed at once.

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:03.010
So, it was flawless,

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:05.850
and his scheme succeeded.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.370
You also placed the statue

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:13.180
of my ancestor Gu Qingkong?

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:16.940
It's the Jade Statue.

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:21.650
Were you trying

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:23.580
to lure us into the ice cave

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:25.010
to be attacked by the python?

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:29.700
Why did you do this?

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.580
Because this hunting lodge

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:35.850
is my home.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.420
So,

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.730
you are the son of that family.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.180
What was that hunter's surname again?

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.130
I can't quite remember.

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:49.330
Tao.

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:51.610
If I remember correctly,

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.730
that young wife was quite pretty.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:56.220
That was my aunt.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.770
She was even pregnant.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.010
Fifteen years ago,

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.340
you should've long been buried
by the snow.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.770
It was my father and uncle

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:09.530
who dug you out one by one

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:11.890
and brought you home to recover.

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:13.850
Hey, everyone.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:14.700
Come and help.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.020
- Here, Shu.
- Father.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:18.660
Come on.

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:22.340
Some wandering martial folks

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:23.473
were searching for treasure,

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:26.370
using powder and causing an avalanche.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.530
Luckily, we heard the noise

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:30.420
and dug them out.

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:31.570
Their lives

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:32.820
were barely saved.

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:34.820
But the first thing

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.180
you did after waking up

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:40.770
was to silence them.

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:50.300
You beasts.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:51.730
I'll kill you!

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.490
My child is about to be born.

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:20.700
Please let me go.

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:29.220
In this barren, freezing land,

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:31.490
you're so delicate and pretty.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.610
After all, they did save us.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:34.850
Why not

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:37.220
let them die painlessly?

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.580
What a surprise

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.490
that you'd be so compassionate.

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:48.580
How pretty and delicate.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:50.890
Don't worry. It won't hurt.

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:56.260
What a sin.

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:58.490
Stop pretending.

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:00.220
Wasn't this your suggestion?

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.580
"Though they weren't part of Jianghu,"

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.770
"they often helped travelers."

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:07.490
"If they said something"

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:09.730
"and let people know
a righteous sect member"

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:13.060
"like you were mingling with us,"

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.420
"Qingque Sect wouldn't spare you."

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:17.700
Now, you're pretending?

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:18.770
Who is it for?

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:23.820
If Nie Hengcheng were to learn

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:27.100
that you colluded with Elder Duan
to secretly cultivate his skill,

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.370
do you think

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.820
he would spare you?

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:32.670
What did you say?

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:33.550
Enough.

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:35.370
We're on the same side.

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:36.300
Why argue about this?

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:38.370
Let's hurry and find

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:39.770
the saliva of the Snow-Scale Beast.

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:40.970
Then

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:43.220
what about these corpses?

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:47.490
Burn them all.

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.530
Save them from reincarnation.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.250
Failing to eradicate the roots

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:12.940
surely brings endless trouble.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.020
Back then,

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.770
we actually missed you.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.530
You were only 7 or 8 years.

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:20.850
Alone in the snowfields,

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:22.250
how did you survive until now?

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:24.220
I met my master, Master Qianmian.

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:25.770
He rescued me

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.580
and taught me all my skills.

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:30.580
After my master died,

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.890
I returned here.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.220
Eat, Snow.

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:49.300
I'll go steal some cured meat tonight.

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:50.686
I'll come feed you again tomorrow.

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:16.770
Snow,

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:18.420
you've grown so big already.

00:16:28.539 --> 00:16:30.530
I spread news everywhere
that the Snow-Scale Beast

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:32.010
had reappeared in the snow mountains,

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.060
luring the greedy ones here,

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:37.130
and then trapped them in the ice cave.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.380
(Zhou Yulin, Peiqiong Manor)

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:56.610
You killed so many innocent people
for the saliva

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:58.610
and even caused the death of your son.

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:00.250
Even if you master
peerless martial arts,

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:01.370
what use is it?

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:05.180
I've always tried to lure you all here.

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.700
Unfortunately,
my identity was exposed midway

00:17:07.711 --> 00:17:09.239
and I was captured by the demonic sect.

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:10.980
But heaven has eyes.

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:13.380
Miss Cai

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.620
brought me back here,

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:19.660
and I finally met the enemies.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.490
I deliberately put the saliva
in your son's hands

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:24.980
to make you kill each other.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.010
The saliva is yours?

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:31.860
That's right.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.180
The Snow-Scale Beast did appear here.

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:36.940
When I was little,

00:17:37.163 --> 00:17:38.810
my father and uncle collected
quite a bit

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:40.530
of the saliva that dripped
onto the ground.

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:43.050
Do you remember the bed you slept on?

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:44.900
Fifteen years ago,

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.700
the saliva of the Snow-Scale Beast

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.940
was in the ice chest under the bed.

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.620
You didn't have to wait for 15 years.

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.330
Take out the remaining slime.

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:58.860
The last beast is already dead.

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.380
What Miss Cai poured out just now

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:04.860
was indeed the last saliva in the world.

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:06.940
You're lying.

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.490
There must still be saliva.

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:11.620
Take out the remaining slime.

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:12.460
Don't.

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:13.590
My wounds haven't healed.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:14.500
I can't win.

00:18:14.886 --> 00:18:16.730
- We'll find a chance to leave.
- Take it out.

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:18.180
- Leave him to later.
- Take it out.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.220
Take it out.

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:24.660
What is this?

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:27.010
This is gland fluid I extracted
from the bodies

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:28.420
of a thousand female snakes.

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:30.250
Once male snakes smell it, they go mad.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:31.700
No matter where you flee,

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:32.980
they will devour you

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:36.700
until death.

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:52.460
Qinong.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.620
Come and help me.

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:56.180
Qinong.

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:02.370
Qian Xueshen!

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:32.140
I have the Ziwei Method.

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:33.380
I have the Ziwei Method.

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:34.220
Tell me.

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:35.980
Has Nie Zhe's Wudu Palm been perfected?

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:38.010
It's you.

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:39.620
Go, Qian Xueshen.

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.090
Why save me?

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.050
You're not a bad person.

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:44.250
You shouldn't die.

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:45.420
I'm not a bad person?

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:46.860
Are you blind?

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:49.140
I wanted to die long ago.

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:50.330
Qian Xueshen,

00:19:50.383 --> 00:19:51.860
your whole family is dead except you.

00:19:51.936 --> 00:19:53.763
When you reunite
with them in the underworld,

00:19:53.774 --> 00:19:55.294
your parents will surely be delighted.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:04.620
Mu Qingyan!

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.250
The avalanche! Run!

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:51.330
Zhao.

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:58.260
Zhao.

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:32.090
Where is this?

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:35.980
Where is Qian Xueshen?

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:41.730
Once you woke up, you asked about him.

00:21:43.513 --> 00:21:45.180
Why don't you think
about how to repay me?

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.050
I have no money.

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:48.700
Just my life.

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:57.940
Even if you ask me
to give myself to you,

00:21:57.986 --> 00:21:59.330
at most it's one night of passion.

00:21:59.546 --> 00:22:01.090
I won't take responsibility afterward.

is better than tasting

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:25.050
no sweetness at all.

The tri-colored peach blossoms
of Luoying Valley.

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:27.140
So, this place has quite a connection

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.140
with your Luoying Valley.

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:31.090
You're awake.

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:34.660
The landlady?

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:41.900
It must have been you two who saved us.

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:44.490
You soaked in the Wanzai Hot Spring
for quite some time.

00:23:44.636 --> 00:23:45.660
Your injuries have healed.

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.570
Only one of his poisons
remains hard to remove.

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:49.180
Thank you.

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:50.980
Sit.

00:23:58.860 --> 00:23:59.700
Senior,

00:24:00.373 --> 00:24:01.260
where is Qian Xueshen?

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:02.330
Is he all right?

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:03.730
He's much sturdier than you.

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:05.290
He woke up yesterday.

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:12.730
Why is that pretty boy

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:14.730
still alive?

00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:17.570
This is the pattern of Luoying Valley.

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:19.980
Senior, are you

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:23.090
a descendant of my ancestor,
Ms. Gu Qingkong?

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:29.180
This is my master's grandmaster,

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:31.700
your ancestor, Gu Qingkong,

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:33.780
Ms. Gu.

00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:36.490
200 years ago,

00:24:36.501 --> 00:24:38.999
Founder Beichen summoned spirit beasts
from the immortal realm

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:40.140
to eradicate demons.

00:24:40.423 --> 00:24:43.320
Later, martial practitioners discovered
that spirit beasts were helpful.

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:44.620
They forgot gratitude

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:45.860
and slaughtered them wantonly.

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:48.250
Ms. Gu, to protect the spirit beasts,

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:50.770
stood against all martial practitioners.

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:52.810
But no matter how gifted she was,

00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:55.050
she could not withstand
endless human greed.

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:56.850
In the end,

00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:59.620
she could only flee here
with the surviving spirit beasts

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:02.620
and vanish without a trace.

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:04.940
That's our first demoness.

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:06.010
Independent

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:07.180
and exceptional.

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:10.010
They say your demonesses defy the world

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:11.180
and are intolerable to all.

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:12.770
Why are you so proud about it?

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.090
They were smeared
because they were invincible.

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:16.500
No need to mind it.

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:18.700
Zhao is right.

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:22.660
Those people are simply shameless.

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:25.810
By the way, senior,

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:27.050
does the Snow-Scale Beast

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:30.140
still live today?

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:32.010
When your aunt came back then,

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:36.090
the last Snow-Scale Beast
was already at death's door.

00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:37.180
My aunt came here?

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.250
She also came to look for the saliva.

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:44.290
A masked man traveled with her.

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:47.730
This painting was drawn by that man.

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:53.940
(Uncle Zhou and Master are upright.)

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:55.330
(They shouldn't have worn masks.)

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:59.010
Why did my aunt seek the saliva,

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:00.250
and who was that man?

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:03.660
Have you known Qian Xueshen
for a long time?

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:07.620
The Tao family often brought prey
to my master and me.

00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:09.770
Shu and I grew up together.

00:26:09.993 --> 00:26:11.380
The inn at the foot of the mountain

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:13.700
was set up to avenge the Tao family.

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:15.860
First, to gather information.

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:17.260
Second,

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:20.490
to stop innocent people
from dying senselessly.

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.140
Since you were so close
to the Tao family,

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:24.540
then

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:26.620
why didn't you intervene

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.810
the night they were killed?

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:33.850
At that time,

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:36.980
I was away seeking spirit medicine
for the dying Snow-Scale Beast.

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:38.660
I wasn't on the mountain.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:40.810
The Tao family were all kind people

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:42.900
and saved many travelers.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:44.490
Who could have expected

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:46.090
that this world

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:48.220
and the people of Jianghu

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:50.490
had never changed?

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:52.770
Where is Qian Xueshen?

00:26:58.570 --> 00:26:59.420
Qian Xueshen.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:02.420
My name is not Qian Xueshen.

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:06.250
My name is Tao Shu.

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:07.460
Miss Cai.

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:08.890
Mr. Mu.

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:10.693
Thank you for helping me avenge them.

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:12.090
No need to thank us.

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:13.260
In the end,

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:15.180
all sects owe you a debt.

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:17.740
Qian...

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:19.130
Shu,

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:21.860
is there still even a little

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.620
of the Snow-Scale Beast's saliva left?

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:26.660
Has the Snow-Scale Beast

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:28.700
left behind

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:30.020
anything else?

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.010
Xuegu once said

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:35.860
the Snow-Scale Beast
seemed to have left an egg.

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:44.730
A Snow-Scale Beast lays eggs?

00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:49.090
Ancient dragons reproduce by eggs.

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:51.090
But this egg has been laid
for many years

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:52.420
and still refuses to hatch.

00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:54.180
Didn't you raise Peng birds before?

00:27:54.285 --> 00:27:55.792
You should know how to incubate eggs.

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:58.290
Call over your two Golden Pengs
to hatch it.

00:27:58.530 --> 00:27:59.660
My Golden Pengs are male.

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:01.220
Both of them?

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:03.330
That's too cruel of you.

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:04.250
I...

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:06.420
Peng birds and dragon beasts
are natural enemies.

00:28:06.464 --> 00:28:07.969
Dragon beasts are spiritual creatures.

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:08.940
If they sense danger,

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:10.220
they will never hatch.

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:12.250
Using Peng birds won't work.

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:14.380
My father once said

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:18.290
that ancient spirit beasts resonate
with their masters.

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:20.980
They rely on recognizing blood aura

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:22.730
to form a bond.

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:24.660
Since this Snow-Scale Beast

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:26.900
was saved by Luoying Valley's ancestor,

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:28.756
and they'd lived together for years,

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:30.810
it must recognize that blood aura.

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:33.220
Perhaps

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:37.090
the blood aura of Luoying Valley

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:39.570
can awaken it.

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:55.140
Did your father say

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:57.380
how much blood is needed
to raise a spirit beast?

00:28:57.570 --> 00:28:58.860
I've been weak in blood aura.

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:00.250
I don't know if it'll work.

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:13.170
Look.

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:14.330
It didn't work.

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:16.380
That shouldn't be.

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:18.370
Again.

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:25.940
Mu Qingyan!

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:26.780
Look.

00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:53.250
Dragon.

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:01.660
So good.

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:04.260
Dragon.

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:06.420
Spit out some saliva.

00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:11.380
You've got nerve.

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:13.490
Come on.

00:30:13.501 --> 00:30:14.660
If you don't spit out saliva,

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:15.683
I'll stew you into soup.

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:24.020
Get down here.

00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:27.196
If you don't come down,

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:28.330
I'll braise you.

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:31.890
Don't run.

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:34.380
Don't run.

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:37.373
I'll chop you into mince

00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:38.410
and make wonton.

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.620
Give me some.

00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:58.330
Please.

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:02.330
Come on.

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:12.980
I'm telling you.

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.140
Behave,

00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:16.860
or I'll kill you.

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:30.570
(Isn't this Grandfather's mechanism?)

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:34.290
It fell asleep.

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:36.900
So cute.

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:41.860
Once I get the saliva
and find my master,

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:43.420
I'll come back to keep it company.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.770
You complain for three days

00:31:48.939 --> 00:31:50.512
just because a wonton has no scallions.

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:53.220
Someone so attached to worldly pleasures

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:56.530
could hardly last three days

00:31:57.770 --> 00:31:58.980
on this cold, silent snow peak.

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:00.900
And you want to live here long-term?

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:04.330
Why say it out loud?

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:12.900
I selfishly forced it

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:15.290
to hatch.

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:19.770
There's only one Snow-Scale Beast
in this world.

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:21.730
It must be very lonely.

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:24.380
The Snow-Scale Beast
lives a very long life.

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:26.730
At least 200 years.

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:28.936
In 200 years, the world
will change many times.

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:30.730
Maybe somewhere out there,

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:32.770
another of its kind will appear.

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:33.820
So,

00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:36.090
we ordinary mortals

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:38.490
needn't rack our brains worrying

00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:41.660
about this long-lived little creature.

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:47.010
You seem pretty concerned yourself.

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:48.770
How would I care

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:51.700
about a little spirit beast?

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:52.890
Really?

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:06.380
Hard work pays off.

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:07.810
We finally got it.

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:16.810
But can this thing

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:20.050
really counter the Body Shift?

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:27.820
Don't move.

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:35.940
Young Master,

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:37.260
forgive me.

00:33:57.570 --> 00:33:59.140
Why turn me into a woman?

00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:11.260
After taking the saliva,

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:12.666
it takes two hours to take effect.

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:15.940
What if I can't change back?

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:16.860
Rest assured.

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:17.700
You will.

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:20.050
I have something to do. I'll go first.

00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:25.780
Anyway, the antidote takes two hours.

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:27.082
Since you have nothing to do,

00:34:27.093 --> 00:34:28.013
do me a favor.

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:29.780
Whatever is in your mind,

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:31.090
it's impossible.

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:32.570
Mu.

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:36.010
I even borrowed these clothes for you.

00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:53.010
Xuegu?

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:54.370
Senior,

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:56.650
Xuegu wants to ask you

00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:58.570
why you hid your identity from her.

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:00.420
Qian Xueshen said you have no name

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:01.300
and belong to no sect.

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:03.530
Why do you know
the Ning clan's mechanisms?

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:04.850
Could it be...

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:05.740
Is your mother well?

00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:07.050
Uncle?

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:09.650
My mother said
you disappeared 15 years ago.

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:11.260
Everyone thought you were dead.

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:12.940
I have been reborn.

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:14.210
The past

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:15.170
no longer counts.

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:17.700
Mr. Mu.

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:21.050
Is this the Qianmian Sect's Body Shift?

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:23.180
Uncle,

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:25.130
you even recognized him?

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:27.249
Xuegu and I have known each other
for over ten years.

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:29.210
I can tell at a glance.

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:31.050
Mr. Ning, sharp eyes indeed.

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:32.660
Uncle,

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:35.490
my mother and great-aunt
often think of you.

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:37.010
When do you plan to return?

00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:41.850
I won't.

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:43.340
The world is dull.

00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:45.010
My beloved matters more.

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:46.980
Xuegu is about to wake up.

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:49.820
I need to brew tea
and cook congee for her.

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:01.300
It really works.

00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:03.130
We can go back.

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:04.530
We'll depart early tomorrow morning.

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:06.340
Uncle warned me

00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:08.610
not to reveal the snow mountains
or his matters,

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:12.530
so the spirit beasts and they
can have their last pure land.

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:15.610
Once we part,

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:20.690
I don't think we'll meet again.

00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:25.530
Zhao,

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:29.010
would you give up everything

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:31.530
for the one you love?

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:37.300
Of course not.

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:38.700
As you said,

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:40.420
I'm attached to the bustling world.

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:41.700
Besides,

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:43.233
I haven't become the Manager yet.

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:45.480
How could I give up everything
for someone?

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:47.980
What if it were for me?

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:49.530
For you?

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:54.340
I'd be even less willing.

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:55.820
Think about it.

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:58.260
The Lord of Qianmian Sect
made a wrong choice

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:00.780
and ruined the entire sect.

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:02.860
The past warns the future.

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:05.130
I wouldn't do something that foolish.

00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:08.610
You're right.

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:11.140
What about you?

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:14.900
Would you give up everything
for someone?

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:16.180
I would.

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:17.850
I don't believe it.

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:19.900
There's nothing I can't give up.

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:22.980
As the Young Master,

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:25.170
you'll surely have
piles of gold and silver,

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:26.300
wives and concubines aplenty,

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:27.530
fine clothes, and rich food.

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:29.690
You have everything to give up,

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:31.490
but you just can't.

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:33.780
Is that how you see the life

00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:35.050
of the Young Master?

00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:36.330
Then what is it like?

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:00.610
What a lousy bird,

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:01.780
wanting to eat a little beast.

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:05.340
They're natural enemies,

00:38:06.573 --> 00:38:07.690
locked in deadly opposition

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:09.900
for generations.

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:10.740
Just like the Li Sect

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:12.210
and your Six Sects.

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:15.780
As long as you're happy.

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:20.650
You really aren't coming with us?

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:23.260
This frozen wilderness is deserted.

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:25.050
My uncle stayed for Xuegu.

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:26.300
Why are you staying?

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:27.330
For it.

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:33.090
The Snow-Scale Beast

00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:34.610
or the Body Shift

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:36.936
never should have reappeared
in this world.

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:39.380
I couldn't let go of this skin.

00:38:39.569 --> 00:38:41.455
Consider me leaving an heir
for the Tao family.

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:45.130
This is where my family
lived for generations.

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:46.650
Staying here,

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:48.420
I feel at ease.

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:50.570
I'll raise the little dragon beast.

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:53.090
Ms. Cai.

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:54.100
Mr. Mu.

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:56.740
Meeting you both was my fortune.

00:38:57.210 --> 00:38:58.860
All banquets must end.

00:38:58.980 --> 00:38:59.820
Let us

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:01.340
part here.

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:03.220
Take care.

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:04.320
Take care.

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:05.260
Take care.

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:13.860
(May we never meet again.)

00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:16.330
(Zhao,)

00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:18.050
(thank you.)

00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:20.780
(Thank you for believing in me)

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:24.300
(and not giving up on me.)

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:54.690
Come and help.

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:02.490
People

00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:03.940
are both good and bad.

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:07.010
Even if you save just one good person,

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:08.340
it's worth it.

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:09.570
Do you understand?

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:10.610
Mother.

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:14.260
Father. Mother.

00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:17.690
If I encounter travelers in need again,

00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:20.740
I will still save them,
just like you did.

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.050
You were never wrong.

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:26.820
Those who do evil are.

00:40:36.601 --> 00:40:47.261
