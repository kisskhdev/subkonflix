00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:19.750
Of course you wanna kill me.
You and Witch Baba are in cahoots.

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.583
Say that again.

00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:25.708
You two are in cahoots.

00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.666
-We're in cahoots?
-What?

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.875
-Influencer? Predictions?
-Let go!

00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:34.000
I have evidence
that you two are in cahoots!

00:00:37.125 --> 00:00:40.500
Witch Baba sent this encrypted message
to Wa Tsai in Bulgarian.

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:43.541
This is the translation.

00:00:47.583 --> 00:00:48.833
CHEN CHIA-JEN

00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:52.125
WITCH BABA
WATCH NEW VIDEO NOW

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.833
Mom.

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.083
Mom!

00:02:35.875 --> 00:02:38.000
Can you not listen to that when eating?

00:02:44.708 --> 00:02:47.333
I said, can you not listen to that
when eating?

00:02:48.291 --> 00:02:49.625
It's a live stream.

00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:08.416
What did you say? Say it again!

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.916
Fuck you, asshole! Pussy!

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.708
-I'll add a charge for insulting officers.
-What?

00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:14.500
-Mr. jen.
-Mr. jen…

00:03:14.583 --> 00:03:16.333
Fuck! You asshole! Pussy!

00:03:17.625 --> 00:03:18.541
Where are you going?

00:03:20.625 --> 00:03:23.625
Did you hear me?
I asked you where you're going.

00:03:24.291 --> 00:03:26.458
I already told you, I'm going to a gig.

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:29.541
That's so pointless.

00:03:30.333 --> 00:03:33.166
Singing for a bunch of people
you don't know.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.500
What a waste of time.

00:03:34.583 --> 00:03:35.791
That's my job.

00:03:36.291 --> 00:03:37.375
What job?

00:03:38.125 --> 00:03:40.833
Shouldn't you spend your time studying?

00:03:42.208 --> 00:03:44.041
What's it to you? I like it.

00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:50.125
You actually forgot.
Do you know what today is?

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.625
Mom's birthday, and? You're still a loser.

00:03:55.416 --> 00:03:56.416
What did you say?

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.875
You're not going anywhere.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.875
-Spend some time with Mom.
-What?

00:04:01.666 --> 00:04:04.000
-Put that down.
-No, give it back!

00:04:04.083 --> 00:04:06.541
-No! You're staying.
-Are you crazy?

00:04:06.625 --> 00:04:08.708
You're pathetic.
What do you even do all day?

00:04:08.791 --> 00:04:09.666
What did you say?

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:11.208
Say that again!

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.875
I said you're pathetic.

00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.333
You talk about Mom all day,

00:04:15.416 --> 00:04:17.500
but it's your fault Mom's dead!

00:04:17.583 --> 00:04:19.875
She should've seen a doctor.
You lied to me.

00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.416
You acted like we were a happy family!

00:04:26.583 --> 00:04:28.166
-What's wrong with you?
-Loser!

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.416
Loser!

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.625
You called me a loser?

00:04:30.708 --> 00:04:33.875
I said I hate you!
Why wejen't you the one who died?

00:04:34.625 --> 00:04:36.750
Give me my mom back!

00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.666
Back off. Mind your own business.

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:54.500
-I…
-Stay away from me.

00:05:30.208 --> 00:05:31.208
Hey, Yu-chieh.

00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:36.125
Have you checked your phone?

00:06:26.291 --> 00:06:29.083
WITCH BABA

00:06:32.083 --> 00:06:34.000
-Hello, everyone.
-Chiu-chiu.

00:06:34.083 --> 00:06:35.875
I'm Witch Baba.

00:06:36.375 --> 00:06:39.791
Yesterday, I predicted
that someone would die from drowning.

00:06:40.375 --> 00:06:42.416
I'm really sorry.

00:06:43.083 --> 00:06:44.875
We're still going to draw

00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.500
the next prediction.

00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:51.208
Obelisk reversed.

00:06:51.708 --> 00:06:53.750
Orient Express upright.

00:06:53.833 --> 00:06:56.333
Amazonia reversed.

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:57.458
In the future…

00:06:59.291 --> 00:07:03.166
In the future,
someone will be stabbed to death.

00:07:18.916 --> 00:07:20.833
-Hello?
-Hey, it's Hippo.

00:07:20.916 --> 00:07:22.041
I remembered.

00:07:22.125 --> 00:07:24.416
The Illuminati Cards unboxing video,

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.458
I think I remember who made it.

00:07:26.541 --> 00:07:27.375
Who?

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:36.958
Hello, what's up?

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:39.250
Oromo Cafe.

00:07:43.666 --> 00:07:44.833
Ting-yu is coming.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.541
I can go after this, right?

00:07:50.625 --> 00:07:52.708
You better not play any tricks.

00:08:02.208 --> 00:08:03.166
Is Little Egg here?

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:04.291
She's upstairs.

00:08:04.833 --> 00:08:07.125
YU-CHIEH

00:08:23.708 --> 00:08:24.541
You made it.

00:08:30.916 --> 00:08:32.500
Cheers.

00:08:48.208 --> 00:08:49.208
Why'd you bring him?

00:08:54.666 --> 00:08:56.375
I'll have lemon cake,

00:08:56.458 --> 00:08:58.916
caramel macchiato cake,
and German apple pie cake.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.125
-What do you want?
-Chocolate cake.

00:09:01.208 --> 00:09:02.666
-New York cheesecake?
-Okay.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.916
-The blueberry one looks better.
-Sure, and you?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.875
I'll have a cinnamon roll
and some opera cake.

00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.666
Okay, and some cocoa oolong cake.

00:09:11.458 --> 00:09:12.791
Rainbow cake.

00:09:12.875 --> 00:09:15.041
-Hey, do you want waffles?
-Yes.

00:09:15.125 --> 00:09:16.583
Honey cream mochi waffles.

00:09:16.666 --> 00:09:18.208
-Salad too, I'm hungry.
-Hey.

00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:20.625
Pork chop cheese salad.

00:09:20.708 --> 00:09:22.750
-Sounds good.
-Can you hurry up?

00:09:22.833 --> 00:09:25.750
Yes. The cop is paying, right?

00:09:25.833 --> 00:09:28.083
-What about drinks?
-I want a black coffee.

00:09:28.166 --> 00:09:29.333
-I want a latte.
-Latte.

00:09:29.416 --> 00:09:31.125
Let me confirm your order.

00:09:31.208 --> 00:09:32.833
TAKE MEDICINE
REMIND LATER

00:09:32.916 --> 00:09:35.041
NY cheesecake,
blueberry cheesecake, apple pie,

00:09:35.125 --> 00:09:37.333
caramel macchiato,
lemon cake, cinnamon roll,

00:09:37.416 --> 00:09:39.666
chocolate cake, honey cream waffles,

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:42.375
pork chop cheese salad, and rainbow cake.

00:09:42.458 --> 00:09:44.833
A house special, black coffee, latte,

00:09:44.916 --> 00:09:47.291
a strawberry smoothie,
and a mango smoothie.

00:09:47.375 --> 00:09:48.666
-That's right.
-Thanks.

00:09:51.666 --> 00:09:53.041
Listen, these cards…

00:09:53.125 --> 00:09:55.250
Is a drink enough? We can share food.

00:09:55.333 --> 00:09:56.583
Where did you get these?

00:09:56.666 --> 00:09:57.583
Is Wei Yen okay?

00:09:57.666 --> 00:09:59.833
-Did you hear about Wa Tsai?
-Pay attention.

00:09:59.916 --> 00:10:02.916
Oh, your friend is noisy.
Will you tell him to be quiet?

00:10:06.208 --> 00:10:07.333
Ask her for me.

00:10:10.875 --> 00:10:12.708
Just answer his question.

00:10:13.458 --> 00:10:14.583
That's so funny.

00:10:14.666 --> 00:10:16.750
So, we're relaying messages now?

00:10:16.833 --> 00:10:18.000
That's hilarious.

00:10:19.125 --> 00:10:20.833
Miss, can you cooperate?

00:10:20.916 --> 00:10:22.041
You're annoying.

00:10:22.125 --> 00:10:24.458
I don't want to talk to a killer cop.

00:10:26.375 --> 00:10:28.958
-Say that again.
-I'm not talking to a killer cop!

00:10:29.041 --> 00:10:30.208
You're coming with me!

00:10:30.291 --> 00:10:32.250
-Go ahead. Cuff me!
-What are you doing?

00:10:32.333 --> 00:10:34.500
-You're obstructing police work.
-Go ahead!

00:10:34.583 --> 00:10:36.041
-Do it!
-Stop filming!

00:10:36.125 --> 00:10:37.500
Stop filming! No filming.

00:10:37.583 --> 00:10:39.750
-Who do you think you are? My dad?
-Enough…

00:10:56.416 --> 00:10:57.625
You think you're my dad?

00:11:04.333 --> 00:11:05.541
What? What's going on?

00:11:05.625 --> 00:11:06.958
I'm fine…

00:11:08.375 --> 00:11:09.916
-Are you okay?
-What's wrong?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:10.916
I'm fine…

00:11:12.916 --> 00:11:14.208
Can we have some water?

00:11:14.291 --> 00:11:15.541
Waitress, water!

00:11:17.291 --> 00:11:19.125
How many do you take?

00:11:19.208 --> 00:11:20.375
One.

00:11:20.458 --> 00:11:21.708
-Have some water.
-Water.

00:11:26.166 --> 00:11:27.000
What now?

00:11:28.666 --> 00:11:30.416
-What's going on?
-I'm fine.

00:11:33.916 --> 00:11:34.750
Hey.

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:48.750
MEETING IN PROGRESS
DO NOT DISTURB

00:11:51.208 --> 00:11:52.125
Hi, sir.

00:11:54.875 --> 00:11:55.708
Sir.

00:11:56.375 --> 00:11:57.291
Sir.

00:11:59.083 --> 00:12:02.250
Excuse me…

00:12:03.083 --> 00:12:08.083
Sir, this is the request
to access Yeh Pin-hsuan's call logs.

00:12:08.166 --> 00:12:09.125
Please review it.

00:12:10.166 --> 00:12:12.541
-If she--
-Who is Yeh Pin-hsuan?

00:12:12.625 --> 00:12:15.833
She was at the Liu Yen-hua crime scene.
I find her suspicious.

00:12:15.916 --> 00:12:18.125
I'd like to look into her whereabouts.

00:12:18.208 --> 00:12:21.583
Shouldn't you focus on
Liu Yen-hua's activities before he died?

00:12:21.666 --> 00:12:22.500
No, but…

00:12:27.375 --> 00:12:29.416
Her dessert shop
isn't near the crime scene.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:31.708
Don't you find that strange?

00:12:34.625 --> 00:12:36.500
I won't sign it without evidence.

00:12:44.583 --> 00:12:45.833
I got it.

00:13:05.083 --> 00:13:08.041
CONTACT RECORDS RETRIEVAL REQUEST
SUBJECT: LIU YEN-HUA

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.708
I want to report a case.

00:13:21.791 --> 00:13:23.208
POLICE OFFICER: LI HSIN-PING

00:13:23.291 --> 00:13:25.625
-Miss, can you be more specific?
-I'm trying.

00:13:25.708 --> 00:13:29.958
My friend has been missing for five days.
I need you to find her now, please.

00:13:30.041 --> 00:13:30.958
Miss, calm down.

00:13:31.041 --> 00:13:32.458
-I called her mom.
-Relax.

00:13:32.541 --> 00:13:36.166
She hasn't heard from her either.
I called over ten times yesterday.

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:38.583
Miss, calm down. Leave your information.

00:13:38.666 --> 00:13:40.958
Her boyfriend used to beat her, you know.

00:13:41.041 --> 00:13:42.458
We have to follow procedure.

00:13:42.541 --> 00:13:43.791
I'm worried about her.

00:13:43.875 --> 00:13:46.291
What if when you find her, she's already…

00:13:55.291 --> 00:13:57.500
Things were pretty good between us.

00:13:57.583 --> 00:13:59.458
We were about to get married

00:13:59.541 --> 00:14:01.958
but she suddenly went missing.

00:14:02.041 --> 00:14:04.125
I'm guessing she got cold feet.

00:14:04.625 --> 00:14:06.166
-And…
-Excuse me.

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:07.958
she's stopped taking my calls.

00:14:08.625 --> 00:14:11.833
Have you contacted her family
or any other friends?

00:14:13.666 --> 00:14:14.791
No.

00:14:14.875 --> 00:14:16.500
She suffers from depression.

00:14:16.583 --> 00:14:17.541
Depression.

00:14:17.625 --> 00:14:19.041
I'm worried about her.

00:14:22.125 --> 00:14:24.458
Why didn't you ask him to open the door?

00:14:24.541 --> 00:14:26.125
Then you could've searched.

00:14:26.708 --> 00:14:29.666
We don't have a search warrant.
Do you want to get sued?

00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:37.375
Then why not request a search warrant?

00:14:38.041 --> 00:14:40.291
If it's that easy, you do it.

00:15:18.541 --> 00:15:21.625
This is a police investigation.
I have some questions.

00:15:22.458 --> 00:15:23.791
Did I do something?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.375
RETRIEVAL SUBJECT: YEH PIN-HSUAN

00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.583
-What now?
-What was that?

00:15:44.666 --> 00:15:46.375
Do you need to go to the hospital?

00:15:46.458 --> 00:15:47.833
-Well…
-Is he okay?

00:15:48.333 --> 00:15:49.750
Alright, fine.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.958
I bought it at An Shen Toy Store.

00:16:01.041 --> 00:16:02.500
What store is that?

00:16:03.083 --> 00:16:04.875
An Shen Toy Store.

00:16:05.458 --> 00:16:06.916
Do they sell masks, too?

00:16:07.583 --> 00:16:09.250
They do, yeah.

00:16:09.333 --> 00:16:12.166
But the killer might not be
the one wearing a mask

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.166
What do you mean?

00:16:16.791 --> 00:16:17.791
I mean…

00:16:17.875 --> 00:16:19.708
anyone can be the killer.

00:16:32.583 --> 00:16:35.375
WITCH BABA

00:16:37.833 --> 00:16:39.666
Hello, everyone.

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:41.958
I'm Witch Baba.

00:16:42.041 --> 00:16:45.750
Yesterday, I predicted
that someone would die from drowning.

00:16:45.833 --> 00:16:48.250
I'm really sorry.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.666
We're still going to draw

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:53.208
the next prediction.

00:16:56.833 --> 00:16:58.750
Obelisk reversed.

00:16:58.833 --> 00:17:01.250
Orient Express upright.

00:17:01.333 --> 00:17:03.958
Amazonia reversed.

00:17:04.041 --> 00:17:05.500
In the future…

00:17:06.583 --> 00:17:10.791
In the future,
someone will be stabbed to death.

00:17:37.291 --> 00:17:39.333
Obelisk reversed.

00:17:39.416 --> 00:17:41.208
Orient Express upright.

00:17:41.875 --> 00:17:43.708
Amazonia reversed.

00:17:43.791 --> 00:17:45.291
Everything online is fake.

00:17:45.375 --> 00:17:47.791
Anyone could be Witch Baba.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:54.500
So the police can't see my face.

00:17:56.166 --> 00:17:57.000
Thank you.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:17:59.958
Hey…

00:18:00.458 --> 00:18:01.458
Where are you going?

00:18:02.666 --> 00:18:03.750
Hey, shit.

00:18:04.583 --> 00:18:06.208
An Shen Toy Store?

00:18:06.291 --> 00:18:07.125
Yes.

00:18:08.291 --> 00:18:09.791
-Hey.
-Yes, but…

00:18:10.291 --> 00:18:13.083
I guess I'll eat all this by myself.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.291
CLOSED

00:18:20.666 --> 00:18:22.333
You don't know who Witch Baba is?

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.416
Think about it carefully, okay?

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.708
She singled you out.

00:18:35.041 --> 00:18:36.583
You must know her.

00:18:39.375 --> 00:18:42.333
One of my friends
is in the hospital, and the other's dead.

00:18:42.416 --> 00:18:44.833
And you're here eating a hot dog.

00:18:49.083 --> 00:18:50.166
What?

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:58.416
I'm free to go?

00:19:05.125 --> 00:19:05.958
Your…

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.833
buddy is no longer in critical condition.

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:11.666
Seriously?

00:19:13.041 --> 00:19:14.166
I just got this.

00:19:15.833 --> 00:19:18.416
A-HUA: WEI MENG-YEN IS OUT OF DANGER

00:19:30.375 --> 00:19:33.375
HAVE A GOOD EVENING

00:19:35.666 --> 00:19:36.666
Your daughter?

00:19:40.833 --> 00:19:43.375
You keep sending her
boomer greeting images.

00:19:43.875 --> 00:19:45.458
You must be driving her crazy.

00:19:48.625 --> 00:19:50.875
What do you mean,
"boomer greeting images"?

00:19:51.625 --> 00:19:52.708
The stuff you send.

00:19:53.416 --> 00:19:55.333
Everyone does it, don't they?

00:19:55.916 --> 00:19:57.583
Only old people send those, okay?

00:19:57.666 --> 00:19:59.166
I only send stickers.

00:20:02.375 --> 00:20:03.458
What stickers?

00:20:07.166 --> 00:20:08.166
I'll show you.

00:20:17.708 --> 00:20:20.583
Wow, you don't have a single sticker.

00:20:20.666 --> 00:20:22.166
I'll send you a sick one.

00:20:25.666 --> 00:20:27.000
That's so ugly.

00:20:27.083 --> 00:20:28.708
Ugly? You're ugly.

00:20:28.791 --> 00:20:30.750
This is so cute. Look.

00:20:34.208 --> 00:20:35.666
I designed this move.

00:20:36.916 --> 00:20:39.250
You shake your shoulders
on the second "Yo".

00:20:39.333 --> 00:20:41.208
Yo! Yo! Try it.

00:20:47.375 --> 00:20:48.500
I'll add you.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.791
-One more question.
-Sure.

00:21:01.666 --> 00:21:03.416
On Facebook…

00:21:04.583 --> 00:21:07.041
can you add people as friends?

00:21:07.833 --> 00:21:08.708
Facebook?

00:21:08.791 --> 00:21:09.875
Yes, you can.

00:21:09.958 --> 00:21:12.125
Usually, only friends can see your posts.

00:21:12.208 --> 00:21:14.500
But I'm an influencer, so it's diffejent.

00:21:14.583 --> 00:21:16.916
My posts get thousands of likes.

00:21:18.666 --> 00:21:20.833
I only asked if you could add friends.

00:21:21.333 --> 00:21:22.166
You can.

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:24.166
But you need a Facebook account first.

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:25.083
Do you have one?

00:21:30.458 --> 00:21:31.458
Here, I'll help you.

00:21:35.416 --> 00:21:37.125
You're unbelievable.

00:21:37.208 --> 00:21:38.916
Ajen't you guys close?

00:21:42.375 --> 00:21:43.916
Are you close to your pajents?

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:49.666
I don't have pajents.

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:55.791
My dad died,
and my mom ran off with another guy.

00:22:02.833 --> 00:22:04.125
Who raised you?

00:22:07.916 --> 00:22:11.125
My grandma.
I moved to Taipei for high school.

00:22:15.458 --> 00:22:17.250
So, what did you do for food?

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:22.708
Uber Eats.

00:22:23.458 --> 00:22:24.916
Do you think I'm a kid?

00:22:33.208 --> 00:22:34.791
I'm setting your profile picture.

00:22:34.875 --> 00:22:36.625
CHEN YU-CHIEH

00:22:36.708 --> 00:22:37.541
Done.

00:22:38.208 --> 00:22:40.500
Now, you just wait for her to accept it.

00:22:45.125 --> 00:22:47.166
-Thank you.
-No big deal.

00:22:50.875 --> 00:22:51.708
You can go now.

00:22:56.541 --> 00:22:57.541
I don't need them.

00:22:57.625 --> 00:22:59.500
Actually, she hates my smoking.

00:23:00.125 --> 00:23:00.958
Go on.

00:23:02.833 --> 00:23:04.250
-I'll get going, then.
-Okay.

00:23:09.416 --> 00:23:10.250
See you.

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:12.583
Hey.

00:23:26.166 --> 00:23:27.083
How did it go?

00:23:27.166 --> 00:23:29.791
Hello, Mr. jen?
I found Witch Baba's location.

00:23:30.416 --> 00:23:31.416
Really?

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.416
Sorry, sir. I jumped the gun.

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:34.541
I mean,

00:23:34.625 --> 00:23:36.583
I suspect Witch Baba is Yeh Pin-hsuan,

00:23:36.666 --> 00:23:39.083
so I checked her IP address.

00:23:39.166 --> 00:23:41.708
-There isn't enough evidence, but--
-Where is it?

00:23:43.041 --> 00:23:44.708
At an internet cafe.

00:23:45.833 --> 00:23:47.458
It's called RS E-Sports.

00:23:47.541 --> 00:23:49.000
No. 26, Yangguang St.

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:58.291
AN SHEN TOY STORE

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:46.083
Sir.

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.208
-Are you looking for someone?
-Police.

00:25:07.041 --> 00:25:08.708
How can I help you, officer?

00:25:08.791 --> 00:25:09.625
It's fine.

00:25:09.708 --> 00:25:12.000
I want to check
your surveillance cameras.

00:25:12.083 --> 00:25:13.875
They're all by the counter.

00:25:14.791 --> 00:25:16.625
Only the front? Nothing in the back?

00:25:16.708 --> 00:25:18.875
Just the ones in front. None in the back.

00:25:18.958 --> 00:25:19.958
Why not?

00:25:20.041 --> 00:25:22.625
We followed the regulations, officer.

00:25:22.708 --> 00:25:24.791
Okay, it's fine. Get back to work.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.375
Hey, sir.

00:26:10.125 --> 00:26:10.958
Hey!

00:26:11.041 --> 00:26:12.000
I'm talking to you!

00:26:12.083 --> 00:26:12.916
Hey!

00:26:14.583 --> 00:26:15.416
Stop!

00:26:55.458 --> 00:26:56.291
Get up!

00:27:17.125 --> 00:27:18.916
Kuo Ta-fu.

00:27:19.541 --> 00:27:20.875
What were you doing there?

00:27:23.875 --> 00:27:24.958
Gaming.

00:27:25.041 --> 00:27:26.791
Why did you run if you were gaming?

00:27:27.583 --> 00:27:28.666
A-Hua.

00:27:35.958 --> 00:27:37.166
Kuo Ta-fu.

00:27:37.833 --> 00:27:39.000
Hekeng Hospital doctor.

00:27:40.416 --> 00:27:41.666
I remember you.

00:27:42.875 --> 00:27:44.541
You treated Wei Meng-yen.

00:27:44.625 --> 00:27:46.333
You also caused the chest bleed.

00:27:48.041 --> 00:27:48.875
Doctor.

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:51.166
What were you doing there?

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:53.500
I've already told him, I was gaming.

00:27:53.583 --> 00:27:54.916
Gaming.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.291
And evading the police?

00:27:57.041 --> 00:27:58.916
He didn't say he was police.

00:27:59.416 --> 00:28:01.375
You ran as soon as you saw him.

00:28:01.458 --> 00:28:02.708
He didn't get a chance.

00:28:03.291 --> 00:28:05.333
Were you playing a gambling game?

00:28:06.166 --> 00:28:07.625
Got a lot of enemies?

00:28:07.708 --> 00:28:08.625
Or dodging debt?

00:28:09.416 --> 00:28:10.708
I want a lawyer.

00:28:12.041 --> 00:28:13.375
You want a lawyer already?

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.416
We see this all the time.

00:28:16.208 --> 00:28:17.958
You're clearly hiding something.

00:28:19.458 --> 00:28:21.416
Tough luck. Mr. jen is sharp.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.250
Otherwise, you would've escaped.

00:28:23.333 --> 00:28:25.500
TAKE MEDICINE
REMIND LATER

00:29:06.625 --> 00:29:08.625
-Hello, Mr. jen?
-Did you find anything?

00:29:11.291 --> 00:29:12.708
Nothing on camera.

00:29:12.791 --> 00:29:16.583
I checked his computer, too.
Nothing unusual in his browser history.

00:29:19.708 --> 00:29:20.541
Hello?

00:29:35.166 --> 00:29:37.208
-Pause…
-Here?

00:29:47.916 --> 00:29:50.083
WITCH BABA
DEATH BY DROWNING

00:29:53.541 --> 00:29:54.791
I knew it.

00:30:01.708 --> 00:30:05.333
XIMEN RED HOUSE

00:30:30.541 --> 00:30:32.708
Here's the Red House. Let's take a photo

00:30:34.333 --> 00:30:36.000
-Let's see.
-Take a photo of me.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:38.416
-He looks strange
-One more photo.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:39.416
Why is he…

00:30:40.583 --> 00:30:41.458
Sir…

00:30:41.541 --> 00:30:43.291
Sir, are you okay? Sir!

00:30:43.791 --> 00:30:44.875
Sir…

00:30:44.958 --> 00:30:46.416
Why is he bleeding so much?

00:30:50.208 --> 00:30:52.333
-Sir, are you okay?
-Are you okay?

00:30:52.416 --> 00:30:53.250
-Ambulance!
-911?

00:30:53.333 --> 00:30:54.375
Ximen MRT, Exit 6.

00:30:54.458 --> 00:30:55.375
Are you okay?

00:30:55.458 --> 00:30:56.375
A man collapsed.

00:30:56.458 --> 00:30:58.166
He has a knife in his stomach.

00:30:58.250 --> 00:30:59.458
He's bleeding a lot.

00:31:00.708 --> 00:31:02.750
If you were home,

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:07.166
you need at least one person
to prove that you wejen't home

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:09.208
or that you were home.

00:31:09.791 --> 00:31:10.625
Right?

00:31:10.708 --> 00:31:12.166
To the interrogation room.

00:31:13.375 --> 00:31:14.875
-Interrogation room.
-Let's go.

00:31:14.958 --> 00:31:17.291
-Hey, my lawyer's not here yet.
-Mr. jen.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.208
The news.

00:31:20.875 --> 00:31:23.083
Earlier tonight, at around 8:30 p.m.,

00:31:23.166 --> 00:31:25.958
a shocking murder occurred in Ximending.

00:31:26.041 --> 00:31:29.458
According to eyewitnesses at the scene,

00:31:29.541 --> 00:31:33.958
a man with serious injuries
showed up near the Red House Square.

00:31:34.041 --> 00:31:36.625
However, he collapsed almost immediately,

00:31:36.708 --> 00:31:39.166
which shocked the people nearby.

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:41.000
As for how all of this happened,

00:31:41.083 --> 00:31:43.416
Local police arrived on scene right away.

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:46.583
You can see
the yellow police tape is already up.

00:31:46.666 --> 00:31:48.125
From what we know so far,

00:31:48.208 --> 00:31:51.666
the victim is an influencer surnamed Lin.

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:54.250
However, he was allegedly involved

00:31:54.333 --> 00:31:55.708
in hostile online disputes.

00:31:55.791 --> 00:31:57.500
Whether that led to the murder

00:31:57.583 --> 00:32:00.208
is still under investigation
by the police.

00:32:00.291 --> 00:32:01.750
But if you look closely,

00:32:01.833 --> 00:32:06.625
there have been several recent killings
involving influencers.

00:32:06.708 --> 00:32:07.916
Could this affect

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.125
upcoming events like KOL STAGE?

00:32:10.208 --> 00:32:12.958
This has also drawn public attention.

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:16.750
Can you describe
what happened earlier again?

00:32:19.291 --> 00:32:21.291
There were two witnesses.

00:32:21.375 --> 00:32:23.625
Curjently, we haven't found…

00:32:24.916 --> 00:32:26.375
-Thanks.
-He fell down.

00:32:26.458 --> 00:32:28.666
-Stabbed.
-Four stabs to the stomach.

00:32:29.666 --> 00:32:30.500
Mr. jen.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.541
Lin Po-lun, 27, also an influencer.

00:32:35.625 --> 00:32:37.250
Four stab wounds to the stomach.

00:32:37.333 --> 00:32:39.625
He struggled for three minutes
before he died.

00:32:39.708 --> 00:32:42.041
Two people tried to save him, but failed.

00:32:42.125 --> 00:32:44.875
The crime scene is likely
the alley 500 meters ahead.

00:32:47.083 --> 00:32:48.791
No one saw the killer, right?

00:32:48.875 --> 00:32:49.708
No.

00:33:21.083 --> 00:33:21.916
Hsin-ping.

00:33:24.125 --> 00:33:24.958
Up ahead.

00:33:31.083 --> 00:33:33.000
This series of incidents

00:33:33.083 --> 00:33:37.333
were predicted
by a psychic online influencer.

00:33:37.416 --> 00:33:39.291
She shows up wearing a mask.

00:33:39.375 --> 00:33:43.125
And she runs her channel by drawing cards.

00:33:43.208 --> 00:33:47.833
She's predicted earthquakes
and even major building fires before.

00:33:47.916 --> 00:33:50.541
Whether this case is linked to her

00:33:50.625 --> 00:33:53.125
is still under investigation
by the police.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000
A-Hua.

00:34:07.083 --> 00:34:08.333
Why is he still here?

00:34:09.333 --> 00:34:10.583
Mr. jen detained him.

00:34:10.666 --> 00:34:12.750
He's a suspect
in the influencer murder case.

00:34:13.375 --> 00:34:15.916
Didn't another influencer
just get murdered?

00:34:17.166 --> 00:34:18.250
Right.

00:34:18.333 --> 00:34:19.666
But Mr. jen said--

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:22.375
The killing happened
while he's been detained.

00:34:22.458 --> 00:34:24.250
That's the best alibi.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.208
He's an ER doctor.
Holding him too long might cause problems.

00:34:32.625 --> 00:34:34.625
It's fine. I should report to Mr. jen.

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:38.541
The higher-ups are on to Mr. jen.

00:34:39.166 --> 00:34:42.125
If the netizens jump on him again
because of this…

00:34:42.208 --> 00:34:44.375
He'll face disciplinary action.

00:34:48.166 --> 00:34:49.250
Release him.

00:34:49.875 --> 00:34:51.125
I'll take responsibility.

00:35:05.833 --> 00:35:07.916
He walked this far after being stabbed?

00:35:08.708 --> 00:35:10.125
So, that means

00:35:10.208 --> 00:35:12.958
the body wasn't found
at the primary crime scene.

00:35:37.541 --> 00:35:39.708
Where did you get the gun?

00:35:39.791 --> 00:35:42.833
I applied for it
when I transferred to the field.

00:35:43.416 --> 00:35:44.666
Put it down first.

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:45.750
Okay.

00:35:45.833 --> 00:35:48.208
Did you forget
what you learned at the academy?

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.375
First, don't be afraid of the gun.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.958
Say the target's right in front of you.

00:35:59.041 --> 00:36:00.125
-Okay.
-Yeah.

00:36:00.208 --> 00:36:01.708
Relax

00:36:01.791 --> 00:36:03.541
Ready, aim.

00:36:04.208 --> 00:36:05.250
There you go.

00:36:05.333 --> 00:36:07.625
Your legs. One in front of the other.

00:36:07.708 --> 00:36:10.250
Relax your arms, but keep them straight.

00:36:10.333 --> 00:36:11.166
Okay.

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:13.875
Yes, that's right.

00:36:13.958 --> 00:36:15.125
Good job.

00:36:15.958 --> 00:36:18.041
Return the gun tomorrow.

00:36:21.708 --> 00:36:22.916
Seriously, Mr. jen?

00:36:27.416 --> 00:36:28.958
I'm not afraid of guns.

00:36:29.041 --> 00:36:31.375
I scored 95 on the shooting test.

00:36:32.916 --> 00:36:35.958
You've never fired a gun
and killed someone.

00:36:37.125 --> 00:36:38.250
No…

00:36:38.333 --> 00:36:39.708
I've never done that.

00:36:46.291 --> 00:36:49.416
This should be the primary crime scene.

00:36:53.375 --> 00:36:55.250
There's nowhere to hide nearby.

00:36:56.208 --> 00:36:57.208
I think…

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:01.291
the killer and the deceased
knew each other.

00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:09.625
And he was wearing slippers.

00:37:10.208 --> 00:37:13.041
-Maybe he lives nearby?
-He came out for a smoke.

00:37:19.875 --> 00:37:21.583
He was killed in a public place.

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:24.791
It must've been an impulsive killing.

00:37:25.458 --> 00:37:28.458
The weapon was probably purchased nearby.

00:37:31.083 --> 00:37:33.291
How do you know
it wasn't brought from home?

00:37:34.166 --> 00:37:35.833
You didn't look closely at the body.

00:37:35.916 --> 00:37:39.500
POLICE LINE
DO NOT CROSS

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.666
I heard stories about you
back in the Police Academy.

00:37:53.083 --> 00:37:56.875
They said that you solved a serial murder
after becoming squad leader.

00:37:56.958 --> 00:37:58.416
That's legendary.

00:37:59.125 --> 00:38:01.875
I hope I can be as good as you someday.

00:38:02.916 --> 00:38:04.833
You sure know how to flatter people.

00:38:08.666 --> 00:38:10.791
Which unit were you in before?

00:38:12.333 --> 00:38:14.791
I used to do desk work at the precinct.

00:38:14.875 --> 00:38:18.083
After transferring to the High-Tech Crime,
the workload exploded.

00:38:20.375 --> 00:38:21.583
My dad always says,

00:38:21.666 --> 00:38:23.833
I used to go home once a week.

00:38:23.916 --> 00:38:26.333
Later on, it became once a month.

00:38:26.416 --> 00:38:28.250
Then, once every three months.

00:38:28.333 --> 00:38:29.208
Then eventually--

00:38:29.291 --> 00:38:31.208
It was down to once a year.

00:38:31.708 --> 00:38:32.666
After that…

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:33.916
you never went home.

00:38:35.083 --> 00:38:36.666
You kept working cases

00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:38.291
until your body gave out.

00:38:39.208 --> 00:38:42.125
You never even knew
your own wife was dying.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000
At the end of the day, you're all alone.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.333
LIFE GOODS

00:39:02.416 --> 00:39:03.958
Was that too impulsive?

00:39:13.375 --> 00:39:14.541
The tag on the knife.

00:39:16.041 --> 00:39:18.083
LIFE GOODS

00:39:25.583 --> 00:39:27.916
-399 NTD.
-Li Hsin-ping, High-Tech Crime Unit

00:39:29.833 --> 00:39:31.458
We need to check your cameras.

00:39:31.541 --> 00:39:32.625
Okay.

00:39:38.625 --> 00:39:39.458
Four o'clock…

00:39:40.583 --> 00:39:42.666
Four-thirty, no.

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:44.125
And this is…

00:39:44.791 --> 00:39:45.666
Five o'clock.

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:48.250
And five-thirty.

00:39:49.625 --> 00:39:50.833
And…

00:39:51.333 --> 00:39:52.291
Six o'clock.

00:39:53.833 --> 00:39:54.750
Hey, wait.

00:39:55.375 --> 00:39:56.500
Give it to me.

00:39:59.083 --> 00:40:01.166
Yes, that's her. This woman.

00:40:05.958 --> 00:40:08.291
Amazonia reversed.

00:40:08.791 --> 00:40:10.125
In the future…

00:40:11.125 --> 00:40:15.125
In the future,
someone will be stabbed to death.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.208
399 NTD.

00:40:22.625 --> 00:40:24.083
I received 500 NTD.

00:40:25.708 --> 00:40:27.000
Your change is 101 NTD…

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:29.458
Miss.

00:40:36.375 --> 00:40:37.500
Witch Baba?

00:40:39.916 --> 00:40:40.750
Is it this one?

00:40:40.833 --> 00:40:41.666
Yes.

00:40:44.875 --> 00:40:46.333
-Wait!
-You can't do that.

00:40:46.416 --> 00:40:47.250
Thank you.

00:40:47.333 --> 00:40:48.333
You'll break it.

00:40:52.166 --> 00:40:53.583
Witch Baba?

00:41:10.083 --> 00:41:10.958
KAO PI

00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:19.375
-Hello?
-Hey.

00:41:19.458 --> 00:41:21.083
Who's the guy who got killed?

00:41:23.125 --> 00:41:24.500
The guy who got killed…

00:41:29.083 --> 00:41:30.166
Lin Po-lun?

00:41:30.666 --> 00:41:32.333
An influencer no one follows.

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:34.583
Wei Meng-yen, go to hell!

00:41:34.666 --> 00:41:35.625
The most fun…

00:41:36.208 --> 00:41:37.500
He dissed Wei Yen before.

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.708
So he has something to do with this?

00:41:41.791 --> 00:41:43.125
I don't get it.

00:41:44.916 --> 00:41:46.916
Could it just be a random killing?

00:41:50.208 --> 00:41:51.875
I wish that were the case.

00:41:53.375 --> 00:41:54.583
I'm coming over now.

00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:56.125
Okay.

00:41:56.208 --> 00:41:57.375
Okay, bye.

00:42:02.291 --> 00:42:06.958
WITCH BABA

00:42:08.458 --> 00:42:10.958
Hello, everyone. I'm Witch Baba.

AUDIO CALL
CHEN CHIA-jen

00:42:12.375 --> 00:42:14.833
Today is October 3rd.

00:42:14.916 --> 00:42:17.875
Yesterday, I predicted
that someone would die from drowning.

00:42:18.875 --> 00:42:21.083
I'm really sorry.

00:42:21.958 --> 00:42:23.833
We're still going to…

00:42:23.916 --> 00:42:27.958
We're still going to draw
the next prediction.

Obelisk reversed.

00:42:36.833 --> 00:42:39.333

Amazonia reversed.

00:42:45.041 --> 00:42:46.500
In the future…

00:42:47.541 --> 00:42:49.666
You'll never guess.

00:42:50.166 --> 00:42:54.208
In the future,
someone will be stabbed to death.

00:42:55.541 --> 00:42:56.708
Sorry about that.

00:46:58.041 --> 00:47:03.041
