WEBVTT

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.230
This isn't just the home of the herdsmen

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.450
and the Mazhi people,

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.840
but also the home of the Tibetan antelope

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.310
and all wild animals.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.810
They can't speak.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.920
They won't file reports to you.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.150
If we do it your way

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.120
and develop

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.090
everywhere

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.360
in Mazhi,

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.180
in 100 years,

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.800
we will be gone,

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.130
and the Tibetan antelope and wild animals

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.060
will be gone too.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.000
And Qinghai's sacred mountains and lakes

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
will also be gone.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.780
Whose home will this be then?

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.820
Everything in the Mountain Patrol

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.450
was like a dream.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.270
But I don't want to wake up.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.240
Mom said

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.370
in this world,

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.060
those kind-hearted,

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.220
upright people

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.870
don't always meet a good end.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.540
But those people

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.260
only follow their conscience

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.060
and stubbornly do the right thing.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.130
Even if they are misunderstood,

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.130
despised,

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.890
or hurt,

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.180
they never hold a grudge

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.350
and never worry about the outcome.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.220
Time, however,

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.460
will sift through the chaos

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:05.680
and reveal results

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.330
as precious as gold.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.480
Even if you don’t get to see it,

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.060
future generations

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.540
will.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.570
Now, I announce

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.010
the official

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.750
establishment of the

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.159
Bolamula National Nature Reserve!

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:20.980
You...

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:25.410
You are back?

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:29.500
I'm back.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:34.800
I won't leave again.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.810
I'm never leaving again.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.720
After

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:47.990
the Bolamula Nature Reserve was built,

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.770
7 provincial and national reserves

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:50.670
were set up

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.500
across Qinghai,

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.570
including Sanjiangyuan Nature Reserve,

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.350
Golmud Populus Forest Nature Reserve,

00:10:58.410 --> 00:10:59.670
the Keluke Lake Nature Reserve,

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:02.670
and Tuosu Lake Nature Reserve.

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:06.510
Altogether, there are eleven reserves,

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:07.820
covering

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:11.270
21.77 million hectares,

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.240
with annual environmental funding

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:15.530
reaching billions.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:18.220
Countless environmental volunteers,

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.270
alongside the Party and the government,

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.510
work together to protect this Sanjiangyuan region,

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.790
known as

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:26.440
the "Water Tower of China."

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.820
My family also moved from Mazhi County

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:31.720
to Tianduo.

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:33.530
My family gradually got used to

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:34.630
city life

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.050
and all found new careers.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:39.030
In recent years,

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.370
Tianduo has been vigorously developing its coal industry.

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:43.370
Around the city,

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.810
7 coal mines were built one after another.

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:48.600
As slag heaps grow

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.120
and the streets grow busier,

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:53.120
the conflict between resource development

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.980
and environmental protection

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.100
becomes clear once again.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:00.670
Captain Bai! Captain Bai!

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:01.270
Do you guys

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:02.290
Do you need backup?

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:03.350
Do you need backup?

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:04.860
No backup needed!

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:05.600
No backup needed!

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.440
The Deputy Captain and I

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.240
can handle it!

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:08.790
Alright! Alright!

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:09.650
Stop fighting!

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:10.010
Stop fighting!

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:10.340
Stop fighting!

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:11.170
Alright! Alright!

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:12.030
Stop fighting!

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:13.930
Captain Bai!

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:19.700
Talk this out!

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.030
No fighting!

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:21.550
Right!

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:22.750
You assaulted a police officer!

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:23.440
Do you know that?

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.840
Our captain is bleeding.

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:25.960
Who assaulted a police officer?

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.030
No one did!

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:28.220
You elbowed me!

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:29.440
Officer.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.120
Look at this.

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:31.870
I was really

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:32.430
hit by this lady.

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:33.050
My face was ruined.

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:34.790
He haggled with me for ages.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.270
One sheep is a thousand,

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:37.910
and he tried to cut the price in half.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:39.860
I said I couldn't sell it like that.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.130
In the end we agreed

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.620
on 1,500 yuan

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.030
for two sheep.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.960
Then he suddenly said he didn’t want them anymore.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:46.490
Alright.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.030
Calm down.

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:48.000
It's a free market.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:48.960
Can't I just ask?

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.400
Look at these sheep.

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:51.720
The more I looked at them, the more disgusting they seemed.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.100
You can’t eat them at all.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.440
So I didn't want them anymore.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.120
It is a free market,

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.780
but you have to keep your word.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:57.980
You didn’t want them,

00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:59.370
yet you bargained for so long.

00:12:59.370 --> 00:12:59.890
The price you offered

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:00.320
was accepted by this lady

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.270
in the end,

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.930
and then you backed out.

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:04.220
You're a grown man.

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.210
You can't go back on your word.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:07.860
That said,

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:09.390
no matter the reason,

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:10.590
you can't hit people.

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:12.340
Ma'am,

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:13.270
from now on,

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:14.200
no matter what happens,

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.260
talk it out calmly.

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:16.440
If there’s any dispute,

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.460
call 110

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:19.120
or find the market manager.

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.510
These things are easy to resolve.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.080
Don't get physical again.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:23.720
Got it?

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:26.820
Officer.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.750
Why don't you take the call first?

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:30.150
Yes.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:31.340
You go ahead.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:32.050
When you come back,

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:33.010
we’ll continue arguing.

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:33.770
Arguing?

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:34.690
Stop arguing!

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.280
The police are right here.

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:39.050
Don't move.

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:40.860
Excuse me.

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:44.910
Mr. Bai,

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:46.330
any instructions?

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:48.890
My dear sister,

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:50.050
it’s nearly impossible

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:51.700
to get through to you.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:52.510
Yeah.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.550
My phone hasn’t been working well lately.

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:55.950
Buy me a new one, will you?

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:56.740
Stop it.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:57.860
3:00 this afternoon—

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:58.790
be there on time.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:00.010
We’ll have

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.670
the moving company’s truck haul the big stuff.

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:02.890
We'll use our two cars

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.060
for the valuables.

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.120
Mom doesn’t have any valuables anyway.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:06.840
Those old things of hers

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.580
have been used for years.

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:07.890
Mr. Bai.

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:08.940
They should’ve been thrown away long ago.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.200
But she can’t bear to part with them.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.000
What can we do?

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:12.120
Be home on time.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.250
Don't dawdle until dark.

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:13.510
Mr. Bai.

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:14.110
You got it?

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:15.970
Or Mom will be upset.

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:17.350
Okay, I got it.

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:18.580
I'll bring you a sheep.

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:18.910
Okay.

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:20.710
I'll get to work now.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:21.390
Bye.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:27.810
We arrived?

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.800
Why did you stop here?

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.540
You were snoring too loud.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:36.270
Captain,

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.570
let me drive for a while.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:40.700
Just go back to sleep.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:50.490
Mr. Shao.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.800
Here's a summary of recent inspections

00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:59.130
of coal mines in several cities sent by

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:00.670
the Provincial Environmental Bureau.

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:01.740
Pick out the key points,

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:02.250
print them out,

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:03.510
and put them on my desk.

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:07.140
Print them out and put them on your desk?

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:08.180
You’re an investigative reporter

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:08.810
who covers environmental issues,

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:11.270
and you don’t know about paperless offices?

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:15.089
Yes, you’re right.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:15.680
How about this?

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:16.810
After you organize it,

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:18.400
email it to me, okay?

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:22.160
You.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.660
You really should start training some new people.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:24.260
Don’t dump

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:25.220
every task on me.

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:30.570
What's wrong?

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:32.290
You lifted the lid

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:33.240
on Tianduo,

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:34.480
and they even rolled out the red carpet

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.200
and invited you back to do follow-up reports.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:36.740
Why don’t you

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:37.740
seem happy at all?

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:38.810
Don't want to go?

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:40.750
Do you really think

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:41.400
my report

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.630
was lifting the lid?

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:44.220
You exposed

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:45.350
so many small coal mines

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.940
operating illegally.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.350
Isn’t that lifting the lid?

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:50.150
That's because you didn’t read my original draft.

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:51.850
What I exposed there

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:53.610
went far beyond those small coal mines.

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:54.180
The reality

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.250
is much worse.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.200
Thanks for your hard work, sir.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.050
Grab this side.

00:17:58.050 --> 00:17:58.980
It's a bit heavy.

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:01.010
Hold the top steady.

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:02.000
Hold it, hold it.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:02.510
You had time

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:03.960
to call me 3 times in a row,

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.400
but you couldn’t

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.330
spare a moment to call Mom?

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:06.250
Be careful.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.290
It's her moving day, and she's the only one late.

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:09.680
Mom is having a meeting at the hospital.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.740
She can't get away.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:12.880
That's definitely a lie.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:13.660
Come on, Ju.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:14.160
Why would Yan lie

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.690
about something like that?

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.310
I meant Mom.

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:20.940
There goes your occupational hazard again.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:21.460
You’re always suspecting

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:22.590
everyone of lying.

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:25.460
That small hospital is private.

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:26.900
They value Mom

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.310
because she has so much clinical experience,

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:29.770
so they give her a lot to do.

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:30.840
Put it here.

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:34.590
She uses this excuse every time.

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:36.250
How can there be so many meetings?

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:37.380
She's not Uncle Lin.

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.040
She just can’t sit still.

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:40.810
We brought her here after she retired

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:41.960
to enjoy life.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.160
Who would have thought

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.760
that she’d find another job?

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.240
Loving work too much

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.160
is a kind of illness.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.290
It needs treatment.

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:50.570
And it's hereditary.

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:51.830
Put it inside the room.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:54.700
What's wrong?

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:56.460
I just think you're impressive.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:57.880
Now that you bought a house for Mom in full,

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.270
you sound so confident.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.140
Chun chipped in too.

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.770
I couldn't afford it on my own.

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:03.900
And thanks to Yunfei

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.180
for bargaining with the agent.

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:06.010
He got the price down a lot.

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:08.410
Otherwise, we wouldn't have enough money.

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:09.750
Don't drop it.

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:11.000
These are all

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Mom's valuables.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:14.090
Her most precious things.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.030
What kind of valuables? They’re so heavy.

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.790
Books.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.330
These things

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:20.980
aren't worth a few cents

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:22.110
even as scrap.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:24.940
I can't. Sis,

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:26.030
help me out.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.020
Take one for me.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.380
You...

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.160
you don't exercise enough.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.290
You're out of shape.

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:35.900
Can you handle it?

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:36.850
Sure.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:38.350
Why not?

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.610
That doesn't sound like you.

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:41.870
Always causing chaos,

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:42.790
Go.

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:44.560
punching and kicking all day.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:45.900
If you can't handle it,

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:47.330
you should transfer to the SWAT team.

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:48.070
Transfer to SWAT?

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:49.470
It's not that I couldn't.

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:51.140
With my skills,

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:51.770
I...

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.010
Hurry up.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:55.510
What's wrong?

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:55.920
Hurry.

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:56.790
What happened?

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:57.240
Quick.

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:58.030
What is it?

00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.620
I threw my back out. Hurry.

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.980
Slow down.

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:03.460
Easy now.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:04.590
Lean back.

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:45.880
Chief Huang.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:46.530
Welcome.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.090
Hello.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:47.930
Chief Huang.

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:49.840
Chief Huang.

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:52.380
Welcome, Chief Huang,

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:53.900
and friends from the press,

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:54.660
to Xinhai

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:55.500
to guide our

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:57.300
coal mine rectification work.

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:58.270
You're too modest, Mr. Meng.

00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:59.610
I wouldn't call it guidance.

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:00.740
You are the experts.

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:02.400
Chief Huang,

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.880
the real experts are right here.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.080
Let me introduce you.

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:06.250
This is Mine No. 1's

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:07.420
Manager Bai Chun.

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:08.510
Mine No. 1

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:10.140
is also our benchmark mine.

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:11.720
This is Mine No. 2's

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:12.430
Manager Wu.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.440
Hello, everyone.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.090
Hello.

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:16.030
Mr. Meng.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:17.680
The people here today

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.440
are all from the province's

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:20.590
key media outlets.

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:21.940
If Xinhai

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:23.290
has any trade secrets,

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:24.880
discuss it with our reporter friends

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:25.610
beforehand.

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:27.460
Hearing is deceiving,

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:28.660
seeing is believing.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.080
You can film everything.

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:31.660
Feel free to film as much as you want.

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:32.650
It's also publicity

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:33.590
for Xinhai.

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:34.660
Come,

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:35.440
Manager Bai,

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.610
to introduce

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:37.830
Okay, Mr. Meng.

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:38.560
Chief Huang.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.240
This is Xinhai's

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:40.930
Mine No. 1.

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:41.640
The annual output

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.010
has exceeded one million tons.

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:44.420
We've been here before.

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:50.000
Yes.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.160
I was the one who received you last time.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.010
Look closely.

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.010
Do you see any changes here?

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:58.500
You might not be able

00:21:58.500 --> 00:21:59.460
to tell just yet.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:00.620
Over there,

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:01.610
on the mountain,

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.700
the patches with different colors

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:04.770
are where we recently

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:05.430
carried out

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:07.010
small-scale turf planting

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:08.250
and sowed grass seeds.

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:09.160
This was our miners'

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.440
voluntary initiative.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:11.720
Mine No. 1 became

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:12.940
Xinhai's benchmark

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.530
not just due to advanced technology,

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:16.190
but also an advanced mindset.

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:17.720
Right.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.020
High capacity, good efficiency.

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:21.660
And many workers.

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:24.890
Only then can we afford environmental protection.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:26.330
In the future,

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:27.330
this will be the next focus

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:28.250
of Xinhai's

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:29.550
rectification work.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:30.380
It involves not only

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:31.720
upgrading productivity,

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:32.290
but also

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.940
integrating management experience

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.610
and optimizing production models.

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:36.670
Xinhai Coal Mine's

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:38.530
development philosophy

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:39.850
is quite advanced.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.310
You are able to balance

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:43.500
production and

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:45.190
environmental protection.

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:47.130
You manage production well,

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:48.770
and your environmental work

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:50.180
is also impressive.

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:50.920
Isn't that right?

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:52.160
This is the

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:53.240
comprehensive competitiveness

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.040
that an enterprise should have.

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.180
For the next step,

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:57.440
the optimization and upgrading

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.970
of the city's coal industry

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:00.500
will depend on Xinhai.

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:07.960
Environmental protection isn't just about slogans.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:08.700
Nor can we just look at

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.550
the successful big companies.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.200
To thoroughly solve

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.070
the environmental dilemma

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:14.920
of small coal mines in Tianduo,

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:16.500
the City Coal Bureau

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.250
and Xinhai Group

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:19.000
have proposed

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.090
a consolidation plan

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:21.020
for small mines.

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:22.680
Now,

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.290
I will invite the Chairman

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:24.880
of Xinhai Group,

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:25.790
Mr. Feng Keqing,

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:27.390
to introduce the situation.

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:33.590
Regarding the small and medium coal mines

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:35.190
that failed rectification,

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:36.310
Xinhai plans

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.460
to merge them

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:39.330
into the Group

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:40.720
through acquisition and restructuring.

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.750
The goal is consolidation.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:43.980
We want to change the past situation

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.580
of disorderly development,

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.190
create economies of scale,

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.460
and move towards orderly growth.

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:51.040
For these mines,

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:52.500
we will strictly enforce...

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:53.740
Isn't today's meeting topic

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:55.340
environmental protection?

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.770
Why is it about consolidation now?

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:57.900
What does that mean?

00:23:58.980 --> 00:23:59.850
Consolidation

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:01.310
means letting Xinhai

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:02.840
shoulder a heavier burden.

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:07.860
It means swallowing up all the small mines.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.310
The detailed written report

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.130
has been placed in front of you.

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:16.350
Please review it.

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:27.110
Restructuring SMEs,

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:28.700
consolidating resources,

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:29.880
and upgrading

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:32.030
the industry...

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.270
This is a good thing.

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:35.270
But in the process,

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:37.740
shouldn't we prevent

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.010
one company from becoming too dominant

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:41.340
over the local industry

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:43.180
and forming a monopoly?

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:47.590
Deputy Mayor Lin might not be aware,

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:50.050
but since the beginning of the year...

00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:51.940
Coal prices continue to fall.

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.980
China Coal Group's

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.610
quarterly long-term contract price

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:55.590
has dropped by 6.5 percentage points

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:57.440
compared to the last cycle.

00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:00.110
5,500 kcal thermal coal

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:00.850
has already fallen to

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:02.240
590 per ton.

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:05.120
Asking us at a time like this

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:07.140
for Xinhai to lead the acquisition

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:08.440
and expand capacity,

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:10.480
we're not getting a bargain,

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.180
but taking on a heavy burden.

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:18.950
Since you feel the pressure is so great,

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.020
we can't let Xinhai

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:21.460
bear this loss

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:22.640
all alone.

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:24.770
Shouldn't we

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:25.830
pause for a moment?

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:27.610
Invite a few more

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:28.850
capable companies

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:29.810
to participate together.

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:31.090
This time, Xinhai is acting

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:31.980
solely in response

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:33.700
to the city government's call.

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:34.920
It is out of social responsibility

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.180
that we are doing this.

00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:38.140
Of course,

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:40.240
if you don't trust us,

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:40.960
the leadership can also

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:41.830
find more companies

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:43.420
to participate in the consolidation.

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:45.480
Xinhai is willing to take a backseat.

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:56.510
Coal Bureau,

00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:58.950
what is your opinion on that?

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.110
Regarding this rectification,

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.880
the Provincial Environmental Protection Department's

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.310
guidance is to complete it

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:06.790
within three months

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:08.620
and meet all standards.

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:11.010
One month

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:12.240
has already passed.

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:14.070
Based on our communication

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:14.790
with the city and several

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:17.000
large coal mining enterprises from other regions,

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.330
the results show that

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:20.460
none of them have expressed

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.620
an intention to participate.

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:24.920
As for the monopoly issue

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.420
raised by Vice Mayor Lin,

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:27.630
I think that's

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.450
giving Xinhai too much credit.

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:30.480
Coal resources

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:32.280
belong to the state, after all.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.070
No matter how big Xinhai is,

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:35.440
we must act in accordance with national laws

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.640
and policies.

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:39.830
Just discussing

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:41.560
won't lead to actual progress.

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.730
If a company

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:44.440
is willing to take the first step,

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.460
we should support them.

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:48.790
Chief Ma of the Environmental Protection Bureau,

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:50.320
do you have anything to say?

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:51.790
Chief Ma?

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:53.490
Chief Ma?

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:54.880
Song. Song.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:55.530
Here.

00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:57.070
Check what's going on.

00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:59.500
There was an equipment failure.

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.740
Chief Ma got disconnected.

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:02.010
I didn't want to disturb everyone,

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:03.010
so I didn't fix it.

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:04.240
Okay, I see.

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:05.810
Send the meeting minutes

00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:06.540
to him later.

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.920
Yes, Mayor.

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:08.540
Alright,

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:09.700
let's continue.

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:38.420
We're back.

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:39.530
You're back.

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:40.830
You moved everything?

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:41.360
All done.

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.050
Wenyuan is doing great.

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:44.310
Helping Grandma out.

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:45.150
What is this?

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:45.910
I don't know.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:46.980
Your eldest sister ordered it.

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:48.640
She said it's an air purifier.

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:49.790
You're back.

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:50.740
Mom.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.260
What are you doing?

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:53.950
Sleeping in broad daylight?

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.140
Let me look at my eldest girl.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:55.440
Second Aunt.

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.640
Stop fooling around.

00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:57.720
Get up.

00:27:57.810 --> 00:27:59.070
Second Sister threw out her back.

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:00.240
Threw out her back?

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:02.030
Is it serious? Let me see.

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:02.700
It's not serious.

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:03.570
Just a wrong move,

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:04.090
and I sprained it.

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:05.290
Mom, I checked it.

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:07.790
Lumbosacral ligament sprain.

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:08.480
Put a patch on it,

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:09.750
do some rehab,

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:10.910
and she'll be fine.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.460
At your age,

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:15.180
leave that kind of

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:16.310
frontline work

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.750
to the young ones.

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:19.550
Yes, yes, yes.

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:20.460
You're right.

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:21.610
I'll listen to you.

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:25.220
But I think Second Aunt is the coolest.

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:25.810
I want to be

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:27.010
a police officer too.

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:28.160
Really?

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:29.750
Then you'll be our family's

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:31.750
third-generation police officer.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.320
Wenyuan, let me tell you.

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:35.420
When I was young,

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:36.440
my skills were

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:37.050
absolutely amazing.

00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:38.070
Alright, alright.

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.810
Don't listen to your Second Aunt.

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:39.770
She's just bragging.

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:41.630
Heroes don't brag about the past.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:42.940
How am I bragging?

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:44.160
Come here.

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:45.500
Let's spar.

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:46.680
Face your age.

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:49.110
Forget fighting.

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:49.980
In two years,

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:50.700
just sneezing

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:52.100
will throw your back out.

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:54.440
You're exaggerating.

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:55.380
Just you wait.

00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:58.640
Where's your dad?

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:00.820
Over there.

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.090
Waiting for you to come back

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:03.020
to set the table.

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:11.330
Lingling, Wenyuan,

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:12.180
help me up.

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:14.810
Be careful,

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.340
don't hurt my back again.

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:20.050
Okay.

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.090
Wash your hands.

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:00.180
We're eating soon.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:03.030
Where are you going?

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:03.790
Outside.

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:05.530
Where exactly?

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.320
Outside is just outside.

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:08.660
Where else?

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:10.460
Slow down, Second Aunt.

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:12.010
Yeah, I know.

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:19.500
You think your Second Aunt is cool?

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:24.240
Wash your hands. We're eating soon.

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:24.940
Okay.

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:25.550
Wash up.

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:35.420
Let's go.

00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:36.780
Let's go.

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:39.960
What's going on?

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:40.500
Let's go.

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:41.350
I...

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.030
Your colleague came to deliver the sheep,

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:44.290
and I just ran into him.

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:45.750
I'm asking you.

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.250
This housewarming gift...

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:50.310
Lingling loves it.

00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:52.710
I ordered it specially a couple of days ago.

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:00.810
Dad is unbelievable.

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:03.020
He left without even taking a bite.

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:04.900
I feel like his hair

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:06.140
is getting thinner.

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:08.970
Grandma, did you notice?

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.660
Your dad is busy with work.

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:15.000
He stays up late often.

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:16.610
It's from exhaustion.

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:28.880
I found a table.

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:30.680
Here, put it here.

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:36.240
Ju,

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:37.850
you were thoughtful enough to buy this sheep,

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:39.000
but why didn't you ask Yunfei

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.060
to stay for dinner?

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:40.660
He came all the way

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:42.320
from the provincial capital.

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.030
I haven't settled the score with you yet.

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:47.740
Did you tell him

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:49.200
that we were moving today?

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:51.070
I've noticed something about you.

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:51.610
Why do you always

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:52.810
side with outsiders?

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.500
That's enough, you two.

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:55.440
Look at him pretending.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.530
I barely touched him.

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:57.460
I'm not pretending.

00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:58.400
I moved stuff all afternoon.

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.130
It hurts even when I don't move.

00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:02.310
No matter what,

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:03.550
Yunfei is like a brother to me.

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:04.810
How is he an outsider?

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:07.030
I'm your real brother.

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:10.720
I've been divorced from him for years.

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:11.480
From now on,

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:13.410
stop involving him in everything.

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:14.790
Hurry up and get to work.

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:17.460
Get to work.

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:19.490
Get to work.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:30.530
Look.

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:32.950
Why are you looking at me?

00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:33.700
Aren't you

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:35.230
quite experienced in this?

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:36.610
What experience?

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:38.100
Back in the day,

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:39.200
in one night,

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:40.910
you could skin so many pelts.

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:42.310
That...

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:43.720
That was over ten years ago.

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.380
Why do you keep bringing it up?

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:48.270
Fine.

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.030
Guo, go find Yan.

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:51.000
Let her do it.

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:51.880
She knows how to use a knife.

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:52.270
Okay.

00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:52.990
I'll go.

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:54.030
I'll go find her.

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:55.070
Okay.

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:56.980
I'll butcher it. I'll do it.

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:58.780
You don't need to worry about it.

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:01.830
Go ahead. I'll do it.

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:03.050
Don't worry about it.

00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:03.700
Go.

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:04.610
Do a good job.

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:08.050
My back...

00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:08.850
I'll help you.

00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:10.000
Here, here, here.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.130
Just follow my hand.

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:11.960
Sit down.

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:13.220
I'll give it a good rub.

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.570
Right here. Right here.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:20.810
How is it?

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:22.700
Better?

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:25.470
Why are you back so late today?

00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:28.370
I chatted with Mr. Meng for a bit.

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:31.550
The mine is having inspections and layoffs.

00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:32.810
It's a total mess.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.920
Layoffs at work...

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.200
You should talk less.

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:38.270
Things like this

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:39.900
are the easiest way to offend people.

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:40.750
If you're not careful,

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:41.590
both the higher-ups and those below

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:43.190
will have a problem with you.

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:47.250
Quite a few

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:48.480
old comrades who came with me

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:49.540
from the salt field

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:51.530
are at this age.

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:53.160
If they really get laid off,

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.820
finding a new job will be hard.

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:58.190
If they look around for help,

00:33:58.330 --> 00:33:59.790
it'll still be my problem.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:04.460
To be honest,

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:06.240
that report by Shao Yunfei

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.880
had a big impact.

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:09.280
It made the city leaders

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.340
and us at Xinhai

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.480
all very nervous.

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:14.090
Why don't you...

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:15.750
I'm not going to say anything.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.290
If you want to say something, you go ahead.

00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:19.510
Sis.

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:21.230
What's wrong?

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:22.260
Come look, quick.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:23.760
What happened?

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:24.500
Slow down.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:25.840
Slow down.

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:26.639
What's wrong?

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:30.350
Look at this stomach.

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:31.980
It's full of coal slag.

00:34:32.050 --> 00:34:33.580
Can we still eat this sheep?

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:44.300
Don't eat the tripe.

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:49.840
Congratulations on the new house, Mom.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:50.230
Come on.

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:51.070
Come on.

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:52.280
Cheers.

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:53.820
Happy housewarming, Mom.

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:00.920
Drink less.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.400
Eat more veggies, Lingling.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.530
Don't just eat meat.

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:05.030
How about

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:05.880
I call the kitchen in a bit,

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:06.650
and tell them

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:07.730
to take that sheep

00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:09.720
straight to my restaurant?

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:12.330
Are you President Bai?

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.510
Or are you becoming President Black-hearted?

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:15.920
How can you be so shady?

00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:17.000
Food our family won't eat,

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.360
you want to feed to others?

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.780
Inside that sheep's stomach,

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:20.840
it's all coal dust.

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:22.860
The heavy metal content is high.

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:24.480
Wrap it up and throw it far away.

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.070
Don't let anyone pick it up and eat it.

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:26.670
I know.

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:28.320
Around Tianduo,

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:29.460
there are so many mines.

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:30.320
What's blowing in the wind

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.900
is practically all coal dust.

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:33.830
Lamb prices have gone up recently.

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:35.130
The lamb in our restaurant

00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:36.930
is all imported from out of town.

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.700
Here, have some Coke.

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:40.190
It's cold.

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:44.690
Some small coal mines these days

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:46.020
are really outrageous.

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:47.210
They don't do any dust suppression.

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:48.230
They bought sprinkler trucks,

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.960
but they just sit there

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:49.940
unused.

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.690
Since they bought them,

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:51.500
why not use them?

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:52.840
To deal with inspections.

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:53.650
When inspectors come,

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:54.300
they fill them up,

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:54.900
drive them out,

00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:55.830
and put on a show.

00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:57.480
If you ask me,

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:58.670
we should take those

00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:00.130
non-compliant small coal mines

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:01.390
and shut them all down.

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:04.350
That's not realistic.

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:05.150
Think about a mine.

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:06.650
How many people depend on it for a living?

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:08.180
You can't just shut it down.

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:09.360
If you ask me,

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:11.520
my sister isn't cut out to be a leader.

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:12.500
As for being a captain,

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:13.690
she can only be a deputy.

00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:15.340
Her view is too one-sided.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.110
The seven coal mines in our city

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:18.840
were all introduced by Uncle Lin.

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:19.550
Our development these years

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:20.340
relied entirely on them.

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:22.070
How can she just shut them down?

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:23.210
Mom.

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:24.170
Here.

00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:30.480
Environmental awareness has improved,

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.680
which is a good thing.

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:33.530
But some people

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:35.050
tend to overcorrect.

00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:36.420
They only see one side,

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:37.730
or even just a corner,

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.170
and start making a fuss.

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:40.610
These sheep,

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:42.190
if those people saw them,

00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:43.300
they'd say

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:44.420
economic development

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:46.220
is destroying the environment.

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:55.130
Enough talk.

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:56.050
Let's eat.

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:00.360
Bai Ju,

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:01.190
eat more.

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:01.960
I am.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:03.490
Have some veggies, you two.

00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:13.210
Captain Bai,

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:13.780
yours.

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:18.880
What's that smell?

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:19.650
It stinks.

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:21.630
Someone threw stuff at me.

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:26.280
What happened? Assaulting a police officer?

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.030
Not exactly.

00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:28.610
It was just chaotic.

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:29.340
Coal dust,

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:30.170
sheep intestines, tripe...

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:30.840
they threw everything.

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:31.860
Got it all over me.

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:33.560
No wonder it smells so gamey.

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:34.320
After work,

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.320
wash up properly.

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:38.100
This isn't the first time, is it?

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:40.170
You're involved every time.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.280
And every time, you're leading

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.480
different herdsmen.

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:44.510
Why are you blocking

00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:46.170
the entrance to the coal mine?

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.460
If you have demands,

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:48.090
express them through

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:49.460
official channels.

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:52.170
What you're doing now

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:53.210
violates the

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:55.280
Public Security Administration Punishments Law.

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:57.150
Interfering with the company's normal production.

00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:57.920
Besides,

00:37:58.210 --> 00:37:59.470
none of these pastures

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:00.320
seem to belong

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.280
to your family.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.650
Your demand is

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.690
for them to stop mining.

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:06.380
You...

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:07.670
This demand... Captain,

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:08.860
isn't it too extreme?

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:09.590
Just in time.

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:10.890
I'll leave this to you.

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:12.870
What's going on?

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:21.730
Han,

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:23.100
do you know each other?

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:28.980
No.

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:34.440
Then you... you have to recuse yourself.

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:36.010
She does have to recuse herself.

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:37.610
The one I hit is her relative.

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:41.010
Who did you hit?

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:45.780
Does it hurt?

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:47.210
Yes.

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:51.010
Why don't you go somewhere

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:52.170
and get a couple of stitches?

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:52.920
Go to whom?

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.500
Have Mom stitch it?

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:55.880
It's fine.

00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:00.070
That Han Xuechao really is something.

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:01.800
He's too heavy-handed.

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:02.800
It's a minor injury.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.060
He'll get over it soon.

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:05.410
It was chaotic.

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:06.590
He didn't mean it.

00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:09.040
Maybe he didn't even recognize me.

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:12.360
Brother, thank you.

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:17.090
You choose to settle.

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:18.780
According to the 'Public Security Administration Punishments Law',

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:19.590
he'll be fined 200 yuan,

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:21.190
and that will be the end of it.

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:23.830
It's a good thing the person he hit was you.

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:25.960
That last part

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.920
sounds so weird.

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:41.500
I have things to do.

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:42.430
I'm leaving now.

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:43.980
Take care of your hand.

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:44.380
Okay.

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:45.610
Han.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:48.650
Han.

00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:56.030
Don't do this again.

00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.320
If it's classified as picking quarrels and provoking trouble,

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:00.110
it won't be as simple

00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:01.040
as paying a fine.

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:02.840
You'll be detained.

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:04.500
Let them detain me.

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:05.660
I'm not afraid.

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:08.380
It's not like I haven't been in there before.

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:09.380
Even going to jail

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:12.030
is better than being an ingrate.

00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:13.000
Han Xuechao,

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.330
what do you mean by that?

00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:17.260
You know exactly

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:18.000
what you did.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:18.730
What did I do?

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:22.110
Yeah.

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:24.030
What did you do?

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:26.210
What did our Mountain Patrol

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:27.010
do in the past?

00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:28.380
And what are you doing now

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:29.440
in that police uniform?

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:30.840
You speak for your brother,

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.240
for the coal mine people,

00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:33.260
and fine us.

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:34.750
I'm a police officer.

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:36.630
I'm doing my job.

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.670
You're worse than me,

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:40.200
a guy in a security uniform.

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:41.320
Hello?

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:43.590
I'll be right back.

00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:45.260
Fired?

00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:46.980
Why are you firing me?

00:40:47.650 --> 00:40:48.360
When I came out,

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:49.190
I asked the supervisor for leave.

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:50.390
You know that, right?

00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:51.750
So what if I hit someone?

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:52.680
I hit a bad guy.

00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:53.610
You know that, right?

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:53.980
I...

00:41:25.610 --> 00:41:26.280
Eat up.

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:28.760
I didn't put meat in your noodles.

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:36.650
If you want to

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:38.130
find a more stable job,

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:40.280
I can ask around for you.

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:40.980
No need.

00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:42.290
I'm not finished yet.

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:44.130
I know what you're going to say.

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:46.080
Isn't it just going to the mine

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:47.230
and working for Bai Chun?

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:49.430
Working is better than hitting people.

00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:00.280
Xinhai Group has offices and hotels

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:01.550
in the city.

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:03.710
You could be a security guard

00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:04.510
or something.

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:07.060
Is there a difference?

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:09.500
Without Xinhai,

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:10.550
will I starve?

00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:22.880
Han Xuechao.

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:26.780
You can't achieve environmental protection by protesting.

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:27.480
I was just doing

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:28.780
my job.

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:30.170
Doing this

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:32.400
won't do any good,

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:34.030
and will only break the law.

00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:35.360
In the end, the company

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:36.820
will just keep producing.

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:38.610
You can't help those herdsmen,

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:39.320
nor can you save the sheep

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.400
that are sick or dead.

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:41.150
You're just

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:42.390
asking for trouble.

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:50.510
I know what you're doing.

00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:58.820
But isn't that like looking for a needle
in a haystack?

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:01.710
If the police can't find anything,

00:43:06.070 --> 00:43:07.230
what makes you think you can?
