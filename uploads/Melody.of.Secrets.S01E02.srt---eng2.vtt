WEBVTT

00:00:00.105 --> 00:00:03.665
(My dreams would be far too mysterious beyond anticipation.)

00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:06.993
(Because I lost my memories 10 years ago.)

00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:08.801
(You are back now, Botpleng?)

00:00:09.605 --> 00:00:10.881
(Can we meet?)

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:14.073
I’m Tankhun, your lover.

00:00:14.113 --> 00:00:15.113
Are you the murderer?

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:16.515
What do you think?

00:00:16.885 --> 00:00:19.297
The deceased just sent you a parcel.

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:21.057
Then a week later,

00:00:21.405 --> 00:00:23.513
you became the one who found his body.

00:00:23.875 --> 00:00:25.251
Isn’t that too much of a coincidence?

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:26.921
Are you suspecting me, Officer?

00:00:26.945 --> 00:00:28.585
Are you sure he’s not lying?

00:00:29.135 --> 00:00:30.135
For sure?

00:00:30.225 --> 00:00:31.225
Sure.

00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:33.871
Coming from the only body language decipherer of the department.

00:00:33.895 --> 00:00:36.353
Maybe you want to protect him

00:00:36.393 --> 00:00:37.561
due to personal reasons.

00:00:38.145 --> 00:00:39.681
You can’t remember me,

00:00:40.605 --> 00:00:41.737
but I can.

00:00:42.085 --> 00:00:44.849
I can remember who Botpleng’s first love is.

00:00:59.561 --> 00:01:00.561
Oh.

00:01:04.015 --> 00:01:05.609
I’ve got your clothes prepared.

00:01:07.605 --> 00:01:08.977
Wash up and get some rest.

00:01:13.305 --> 00:01:14.793
You’re right.

00:01:15.465 --> 00:01:17.049
When you said I’m not ready yet.

00:01:20.725 --> 00:01:21.793
I’m sorry.

00:01:28.845 --> 00:01:30.009
You don’t have to apologize.

00:01:30.555 --> 00:01:31.715
You didn’t do anything wrong.

00:01:32.245 --> 00:01:34.849
Also, I’ve waited for 10 years.

00:01:35.485 --> 00:01:36.753
Just waiting a little longer

00:01:36.777 --> 00:01:37.845
can’t hurt, right?

00:01:45.845 --> 00:01:46.845
Then…

00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:51.233
Can I hold your hand and sleep tonight?

00:01:52.375 --> 00:01:53.375
I think

00:01:53.625 --> 00:01:55.281
being close to you

00:01:56.153 --> 00:01:58.155
might make me remember you faster.

00:02:02.605 --> 00:02:04.401
I don’t want you to wait too long either.

00:04:27.005 --> 00:04:28.081
(He kissed me.)

00:04:28.825 --> 00:04:30.089
(We kissed.)

00:04:31.635 --> 00:04:33.897
(We couldn’t get enough.)

00:04:36.721 --> 00:04:38.881
(We learned about each other’s bodies.)

00:04:40.435 --> 00:04:43.041
(The feeling of touching his skin)

00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:45.129
(felt entirely different from my own.)

00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:49.705
(So does when he touched me.)

00:04:53.645 --> 00:04:57.217
(Tankhun has a long scar on his left wrist.)

00:04:58.735 --> 00:05:00.913
(I softly stroked that scar.)

00:05:03.045 --> 00:05:06.713
(Hoping that the pain in his heart
would subside.)

00:05:19.265 --> 00:05:21.369
(If Tankhun really exists, )

00:05:22.315 --> 00:05:23.849
(then you’re probably not Tankhun.)

00:05:30.297 --> 00:05:33.073
POLICE STATION

00:05:48.595 --> 00:05:49.595
Why are you here?

00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:51.385
Got a ticket?

00:05:51.521 --> 00:05:53.193
If it’s a ticket, I can afford it.

00:05:54.017 --> 00:05:55.289
Why would I be waiting for you?

00:05:57.285 --> 00:05:58.649
Then say what you want.

00:05:59.155 --> 00:06:00.049
But if you can’t have it

00:06:00.073 --> 00:06:01.073
then don’t blame me.

00:06:06.455 --> 00:06:07.769
I want the details

00:06:07.793 --> 00:06:10.313
of the 2 murder and dismemberment cases
that happened yesterday.

00:06:11.805 --> 00:06:13.281
To serve it to your journalist?

00:06:13.595 --> 00:06:15.473
As a criminologist,

00:06:16.125 --> 00:06:17.457
I want to solve this case.

00:06:18.585 --> 00:06:19.977
As a police officer,

00:06:20.335 --> 00:06:21.681
I think you’re being weird.

00:06:23.245 --> 00:06:25.265
Not as weird as finding 2 bodies

00:06:25.297 --> 00:06:27.265
in 2 luggage on the same day.

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:29.725
The murderer is planning something

00:06:30.195 --> 00:06:31.569
And it won’t stop here.

00:06:32.295 --> 00:06:33.297
Don’t you think so?

00:06:42.405 --> 00:06:43.537
Let’s talk inside.

00:06:46.545 --> 00:06:48.081
I want to help Botpleng.

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:49.745
If what you’re trying to find

00:06:49.777 --> 00:06:52.017
is connected to the fact that Botpleng
used to live here,

00:06:52.521 --> 00:06:54.525
then I’ll help you find out the truth.

00:06:55.465 --> 00:06:56.673
Also,

00:06:56.725 --> 00:06:57.925
you’ve just moved here, right?

00:06:58.241 --> 00:06:59.801
Don’t you have to put out achievements?

00:07:00.275 --> 00:07:01.297
Wouldn’t it be better

00:07:01.725 --> 00:07:02.765
to have me help you think?

00:07:04.475 --> 00:07:06.937
I have nothing against you helping.

00:07:07.769 --> 00:07:09.765
But if the result shows that

00:07:09.793 --> 00:07:13.065
Botpleng or people close to him
is the suspect,

00:07:14.005 --> 00:07:15.017
would you be okay with that?

00:07:15.033 --> 00:07:17.257
I don’t mix personal and work matters.

00:07:19.095 --> 00:07:20.257
One more thing,

00:07:20.825 --> 00:07:21.993
I’m sure

00:07:22.355 --> 00:07:23.673
that Pleng is not the culprit.

00:07:35.905 --> 00:07:37.905
Then welcome to the team.

00:07:38.545 --> 00:07:40.009
Adviser Tankhun.

00:07:47.561 --> 00:07:49.565
But let me ruin your confidence a little.

00:07:50.785 --> 00:07:53.033
The link between the victims in both cases

00:07:53.725 --> 00:07:57.297
is that they both worked for Botpleng’s family.

00:07:59.035 --> 00:08:00.081
The first victim

00:08:00.445 --> 00:08:02.753
took care of the Thayadon house.

00:08:03.875 --> 00:08:05.329
While the second victim

00:08:06.885 --> 00:08:09.089
used to work for Botpleng’s father.

00:08:13.915 --> 00:08:15.001
I hope you

00:08:15.595 --> 00:08:18.097
will be able to separate
work and personal matters.

00:08:22.095 --> 00:08:23.633
Thank you for the coffee.

00:08:45.873 --> 00:08:47.875
Is Korat your backyard?

00:08:48.765 --> 00:08:50.177
What if I say

00:08:50.705 --> 00:08:51.705
I didn’t go back?

00:08:54.125 --> 00:08:55.881
Not you acting all weird, too.

00:08:56.685 --> 00:08:58.161
I’m stressed out enough.

00:09:02.965 --> 00:09:03.965
Hold on.

00:09:04.935 --> 00:09:06.361
Did you sleep with him?

00:09:06.735 --> 00:09:07.833
Are you out of your mind?

00:09:08.705 --> 00:09:09.705
Well…

00:09:10.125 --> 00:09:12.089
You only came back in the morning.

00:09:12.645 --> 00:09:14.065
Unless you guys happened to hook up

00:09:14.845 --> 00:09:16.605
what else is there to be stressed out about?

00:09:21.377 --> 00:09:23.375
Do you think scars can go away?

00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:25.105
Is it deep?

00:09:25.285 --> 00:09:27.125
Nowadays, laser treatments can fix it for you.

00:09:32.665 --> 00:09:33.665
Hey!

00:09:34.325 --> 00:09:36.097
Was it so rough that you hurt yourself?

00:09:36.129 --> 00:09:36.737
Damn you!

00:09:36.761 --> 00:09:37.553
That’s not it!

00:09:37.585 --> 00:09:38.585
Oh?

00:09:39.965 --> 00:09:41.137
I’m stressed out

00:09:41.555 --> 00:09:42.857
because there wasn’t any scar.

00:09:50.305 --> 00:09:51.377
No scar?

00:09:52.915 --> 00:09:54.089
What are you talking about?

00:09:57.585 --> 00:10:00.769
The diary says Tankhun has
a deep scar on his wrist.

00:10:01.725 --> 00:10:03.353
But this Tankhun doesn’t have it.

00:10:07.095 --> 00:10:08.329
Then it’s good

00:10:08.361 --> 00:10:09.641
that you haven’t slept with him.

00:10:10.405 --> 00:10:12.561
Because if he’s able to lie to you this well,

00:10:13.325 --> 00:10:16.193
when he said he isn’t the murderer,

00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:18.553
he could be lying to you then, too.

00:10:22.145 --> 00:10:23.145
What are you on about?

00:10:25.645 --> 00:10:27.289
Think carefully.

00:10:28.245 --> 00:10:30.073
Isn’t it too much of a coincidence?

00:10:30.585 --> 00:10:32.201
That you met Tankhun

00:10:32.225 --> 00:10:33.425
and the body at the same time?

00:10:34.665 --> 00:10:36.905
What if Tankhun were the murderer

00:10:37.795 --> 00:10:39.473
and he was using you as a witness?

00:10:43.805 --> 00:10:45.177
Also,

00:10:45.445 --> 00:10:46.897
when the second body that

00:10:46.929 --> 00:10:48.665
died exactly like the first one was found,

00:10:49.645 --> 00:10:51.681
Tankhun also has an alibi

00:10:51.721 --> 00:10:52.721
which is you.

00:10:57.585 --> 00:10:59.209
Isn’t that too much of a coincidence?

00:11:07.885 --> 00:11:09.329
POLICE STATION

00:11:09.355 --> 00:11:12.057
For both bodies found in the luggage,

00:11:12.415 --> 00:11:14.505
we found a relation

00:11:14.537 --> 00:11:17.097
that they were done by the same murderer.

00:11:18.335 --> 00:11:20.417
Therefore, we can conclude that

00:11:20.433 --> 00:11:22.377
the two murder cases

00:11:22.895 --> 00:11:24.921
are part of a serial killing case.

00:11:26.695 --> 00:11:29.681
So today, we invited the press here
to ask for cooperation

00:11:29.713 --> 00:11:33.257
to report necessary information only.

00:11:33.289 --> 00:11:35.689
So as not to impact
the search for the murderer

00:11:36.081 --> 00:11:38.085
who murdered the victims professionally.

00:11:39.375 --> 00:11:40.375
Excuse me.

00:11:41.325 --> 00:11:43.761
Are you saying that we, the press,

00:11:43.793 --> 00:11:46.025
are obstructing the search for the murderer?

00:11:47.805 --> 00:11:50.017
Don’t you think that’s blaming the press

00:11:50.041 --> 00:11:51.249
more than necessary?

00:11:51.695 --> 00:11:53.297
I understand

00:11:53.321 --> 00:11:56.241
that the press has its ethics to uphold.

00:11:57.555 --> 00:12:00.521
Still, the police confirm that
this is not blaming

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:02.353
but asking for cooperation.

00:12:02.393 --> 00:12:04.153
So that no other fatal incidents will occur.

00:12:05.525 --> 00:12:08.521
This method has been discussed

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:10.185
with our criminologist.

00:12:10.905 --> 00:12:12.097
Professor Tankhun.

00:12:28.801 --> 00:12:31.001
Hello, I’m Tankhun.

00:12:31.025 --> 00:12:34.425
Criminologist on criminal psychology
and criminal behavior.

00:12:35.355 --> 00:12:36.721
The adviser of this case.

00:12:42.265 --> 00:12:44.425
The autopsy confirms that

00:12:44.465 --> 00:12:45.905
both bodies died in the same manner.

00:12:45.937 --> 00:12:47.833
That is strangling with garrote knots.

00:12:47.881 --> 00:12:50.305
The bodies are then dismembered.

00:12:50.665 --> 00:12:52.201
The murder was done professionally.

00:12:52.495 --> 00:12:54.329
Everything was done decisively.

00:12:54.361 --> 00:12:55.361
No hesitation.

00:12:55.635 --> 00:12:57.673
The relation between the two bodies

00:12:58.415 --> 00:13:00.025
are that both of them

00:13:00.057 --> 00:13:01.761
used to work for the Thayadon family.

00:13:02.185 --> 00:13:03.185
Yes.

00:13:03.835 --> 00:13:04.873
The Thayadon family.

00:13:05.635 --> 00:13:08.577
And both victims are locals of the same area.

00:13:09.045 --> 00:13:10.409
A lot of murderers

00:13:10.625 --> 00:13:14.065
choose their victims
from the same province or hometown.

00:13:14.315 --> 00:13:16.089
But there can also be other reasons

00:13:16.113 --> 00:13:17.737
which we still don’t know about.

00:13:18.135 --> 00:13:20.281
Then what do you think was the motive?

00:13:23.121 --> 00:13:25.125
This is a murder with purpose.

00:13:25.865 --> 00:13:27.993
But we have to figure out the killing motive.

00:13:28.033 --> 00:13:29.625
Whether it’s revenge,

00:13:29.657 --> 00:13:30.657
cover up,

00:13:31.195 --> 00:13:32.481
or just for pleasure.

00:13:32.841 --> 00:13:34.845
But for a murderer this skilled,

00:13:35.715 --> 00:13:37.401
they must have been paid to kill.

00:13:37.715 --> 00:13:39.825
The strange thing is putting both bodies out

00:13:39.857 --> 00:13:41.129
to expose them.

00:13:41.405 --> 00:13:42.885
As if to mock the police’s authority.

00:13:42.921 --> 00:13:43.993
That’s right.

00:13:44.325 --> 00:13:45.529
It’s so crazy.

00:13:45.561 --> 00:13:47.489
Putting the bodies out in the open,

00:13:47.725 --> 00:13:49.129
as if they wanted us to find them.

00:13:49.505 --> 00:13:50.505
Then what do we do next?

00:13:53.925 --> 00:13:55.681
The press already knew about the bodies.

00:13:56.845 --> 00:13:58.345
We have to control the press first.

00:13:59.645 --> 00:14:00.889
(Based on the discussion

00:14:00.905 --> 00:14:02.089
with Professor Tankhun, )

00:14:02.125 --> 00:14:05.289
We realize that this murderer is daring,

00:14:05.325 --> 00:14:06.325
fearless

00:14:06.785 --> 00:14:08.673
and enjoy mocking the police’s authority.

00:14:08.729 --> 00:14:10.737
So I ask the press for cooperation

00:14:10.761 --> 00:14:12.681
in reporting this case
only as much as necessary.

00:14:13.735 --> 00:14:17.001
You can report the discovery of the bodies

00:14:17.025 --> 00:14:17.833
but I hope you would avoid

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:19.945
the mention of the serial murder.

00:14:21.045 --> 00:14:23.513
Since it would bring pleasure to the murderer

00:14:24.217 --> 00:14:26.215
and make them commit the crime again.

00:14:26.405 --> 00:14:28.377
You want us to hide it from the people

00:14:28.393 --> 00:14:30.537
that there is a murderer in the area?

00:14:30.577 --> 00:14:33.281
I’ll say it one last time.

00:14:34.155 --> 00:14:36.729
That this is the best way

00:14:36.753 --> 00:14:38.725
to handle this murderer.

00:14:40.995 --> 00:14:43.025
Thank you all in advance,

00:14:43.065 --> 00:14:44.193
for your cooperation.

00:14:44.689 --> 00:14:46.833
Have a safe journey back.

00:14:46.865 --> 00:14:47.337
Oh?

00:14:47.785 --> 00:14:48.961
We haven’t got any news.

00:14:53.245 --> 00:14:54.537
We didn’t get anything out of it.

00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:55.561
Yeah.

00:15:03.675 --> 00:15:06.353
POLICE STATION

00:15:07.455 --> 00:15:08.577
So damn weird.

00:15:08.885 --> 00:15:10.433
Asking for cooperation

00:15:10.775 --> 00:15:12.081
but not telling us anything.

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:13.377
Only the excuse of

00:15:13.401 --> 00:15:15.057
“protection, protection”.

00:15:16.385 --> 00:15:18.081
As if they’re trying to shut the press up.

00:15:18.735 --> 00:15:19.881
Is that even acceptable?

00:15:21.885 --> 00:15:22.885
Hey!

00:15:23.335 --> 00:15:24.335
Pleng!

00:15:24.805 --> 00:15:26.233
That bastard Pleng.

00:15:27.145 --> 00:15:28.145
Where did he go?

00:15:32.135 --> 00:15:33.135
Inspector.

00:15:34.125 --> 00:15:35.649
I have something to ask.

00:15:36.121 --> 00:15:38.125
Didn’t you understand the word
“one last time”?

00:15:38.153 --> 00:15:40.125
You can keep quiet if you want

00:15:40.555 --> 00:15:41.809
but if you’re trying to shut the press up,

00:15:41.833 --> 00:15:44.089
and keeping the people in the dark
about the serial killer,

00:15:44.105 --> 00:15:45.113
that’s unacceptable.

00:15:47.805 --> 00:15:50.073
Then, if the murderer can’t be arrested.

00:15:50.465 --> 00:15:52.217
The people are in more danger.

00:15:53.041 --> 00:15:55.281
Would you, Mr. Press,
be able to handle the consequences?

00:15:59.465 --> 00:16:00.809
So that means you already knew

00:16:01.425 --> 00:16:02.697
who the murderer is, right?

00:16:10.729 --> 00:16:11.257
Urgh!

00:16:11.561 --> 00:16:12.617
That’s you!

00:16:13.085 --> 00:16:15.025
You’re causing more people to die.

00:16:15.845 --> 00:16:16.881
What are you guys doing?

00:16:20.645 --> 00:16:22.057
It’s true what you said.

00:16:22.695 --> 00:16:24.449
Some people won’t agree with us

00:16:24.473 --> 00:16:25.537
and try to get in the way.

00:16:27.875 --> 00:16:28.875
Come with me.

00:16:41.645 --> 00:16:42.645
Are you aware

00:16:43.033 --> 00:16:44.689
that what you did

00:16:44.721 --> 00:16:46.145
was threatening Inspector Dao?

00:16:46.725 --> 00:16:47.905
And you know what?

00:16:48.275 --> 00:16:50.441
The police are threatening the press, too.

00:16:51.465 --> 00:16:53.913
Don’t the people have the right
to know what’s going on?

00:16:54.205 --> 00:16:56.889
Especially about a serial killer
which is lurking among us.

00:16:57.297 --> 00:16:59.295
The police should inform everyone
to stay alert.

00:17:02.165 --> 00:17:03.165
You’re right.

00:17:03.885 --> 00:17:05.113
It should be that way,

00:17:05.445 --> 00:17:06.937
if the murderer killed and hid the bodies

00:17:06.953 --> 00:17:07.953
like in the other cases.

00:17:08.445 --> 00:17:11.161
But this murderer wanted to show off
the bodies of the victims.

00:17:11.193 --> 00:17:13.265
If you make this case blow up,

00:17:13.535 --> 00:17:15.257
and encourage the murderer to kill more,

00:17:15.705 --> 00:17:17.169
can you handle the consequences?

00:17:21.935 --> 00:17:23.689
I didn’t know it’d be that bad.

00:17:25.685 --> 00:17:26.685
I’m sorry.

00:17:29.225 --> 00:17:30.825
The one you should apologize to

00:17:30.857 --> 00:17:32.881
is Inspector Dao, not me.

00:17:37.009 --> 00:17:38.457
But you’re angry too.

00:17:39.045 --> 00:17:40.889
Your brows are tied together.

00:17:42.065 --> 00:17:43.193
I’m not angry.

00:17:44.365 --> 00:17:45.365
If you’re not angry,

00:17:45.925 --> 00:17:47.521
then would you go somewhere with me?

00:17:50.035 --> 00:17:51.035
Yeah.

00:17:51.485 --> 00:17:52.485
Fine.

00:17:53.365 --> 00:17:54.617
I’ll go

00:17:55.445 --> 00:17:57.009
if it’s interesting enough.

00:17:57.455 --> 00:17:58.657
I guarantee

00:17:59.649 --> 00:18:01.645
it’s somewhere that will get you in the mood.

00:18:03.405 --> 00:18:04.953
Interesting enough?

00:18:18.175 --> 00:18:19.281
My mom used to say,

00:18:20.017 --> 00:18:22.015
desserts can get you in a good mood.

00:18:22.795 --> 00:18:24.113
Eat a lot.

00:18:24.995 --> 00:18:26.435
So you won’t be angry at me anymore.

00:18:41.525 --> 00:18:42.525
Oh?

00:18:43.937 --> 00:18:44.937
So sour.

00:18:45.285 --> 00:18:46.553
I thought you would like it.

00:18:47.655 --> 00:18:50.097
(Tankhun had star fruit for the first time.)

00:18:50.525 --> 00:18:51.697
(He loved it.)

00:18:56.175 --> 00:18:57.649
I remember your mom said

00:18:57.985 --> 00:18:59.985
you like chocolate cake.

00:19:02.845 --> 00:19:04.217
That’s what mom says.

00:19:05.055 --> 00:19:06.673
But the more I have it,

00:19:07.165 --> 00:19:09.449
I think I like fruit cakes.

00:19:10.045 --> 00:19:11.305
It’s refreshing.

00:19:12.593 --> 00:19:13.745
But just as people say.

00:19:13.785 --> 00:19:16.473
Our preferences probably change with age.

00:19:17.725 --> 00:19:19.889
You used to love star fruits.

00:19:31.521 --> 00:19:33.885
Anything else you’ve changed
from 10 years ago?

00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:46.685
Oh!

00:19:47.065 --> 00:19:47.905
Argh!

00:19:47.937 --> 00:19:48.937
Botpleng!

00:19:50.595 --> 00:19:51.595
Urgh.

00:19:56.765 --> 00:19:57.765
Come here.

00:20:07.935 --> 00:20:08.935
Hey!

00:20:09.685 --> 00:20:10.889
What are you going to do?

00:20:12.935 --> 00:20:14.393
Dress that hot water burn.

00:20:31.685 --> 00:20:32.685
What’s wrong?

00:20:33.565 --> 00:20:34.577
Does it hurt?

00:20:37.595 --> 00:20:38.595
No.

00:20:40.081 --> 00:20:41.465
Just thinking that you’re so nice.

00:20:53.215 --> 00:20:55.481
Why are you messing around
with that vacation house?

00:20:55.905 --> 00:20:56.905
Hm?

00:20:58.075 --> 00:20:59.385
How did you know?

00:20:59.945 --> 00:21:01.153
Why wouldn’t I know?

00:21:01.185 --> 00:21:02.953
That’s my daughter’s house.

00:21:04.685 --> 00:21:05.685
Then…

00:21:08.165 --> 00:21:09.777
You should have known

00:21:10.305 --> 00:21:12.385
that the one who watched over the house
was murdered.

00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:14.895
I think it’s a very strange case.

00:21:15.535 --> 00:21:17.297
Since we’re the owners of the house,

00:21:17.313 --> 00:21:18.921
shouldn’t we help them out?

00:21:20.145 --> 00:21:21.313
What are you on about?

00:21:23.315 --> 00:21:25.529
The owner of that house is my daughter

00:21:25.545 --> 00:21:26.545
not you.

00:21:27.695 --> 00:21:29.945
Don’t you stick your nose in
and try to help anyone.

00:21:29.977 --> 00:21:31.289
Your only responsibility

00:21:31.305 --> 00:21:32.233
is to make that mother of yours,

00:21:32.257 --> 00:21:33.817
who’s lying in bed all sick,

00:21:34.185 --> 00:21:35.545
feel at ease, and that’s it.

00:21:35.945 --> 00:21:37.409
Never go back to that house again.

00:21:38.965 --> 00:21:40.241
You must have forgotten.

00:21:41.445 --> 00:21:43.705
My normal life is being a journalist.

00:21:45.177 --> 00:21:47.175
And the fact that I’m covering a murder case

00:21:47.193 --> 00:21:48.953
should be a normal sight, isn’t it, Grandma?

00:21:50.115 --> 00:21:51.115
Also,

00:21:51.241 --> 00:21:53.245
Mom should actually be glad

00:21:54.085 --> 00:21:56.765
that I’m covering the news about
the one who watched over her house.

00:21:58.895 --> 00:21:59.801
Don’t act like you know

00:21:59.825 --> 00:22:00.961
what my daughter thinks.

00:22:02.295 --> 00:22:03.985
Stop seeking trouble.

00:22:04.265 --> 00:22:06.081
And stop getting involved with that case.

00:22:06.505 --> 00:22:08.505
Never go back to that house ever again.

00:22:10.245 --> 00:22:11.505
That house belongs to Mom.

00:22:13.585 --> 00:22:16.121
So there’s only one person
who can stop me from going there.

00:22:16.145 --> 00:22:17.185
And that’s Mom.

00:22:29.765 --> 00:22:31.289
I don’t understand my grandma.

00:22:33.125 --> 00:22:35.605
Why is she trying to stop me
from getting involved in the case?

00:22:35.845 --> 00:22:37.529
Because she’s worried
on your mom’s behalf.

00:22:37.937 --> 00:22:39.935
Your mom cherishes you
like the apple of her eyes.

00:22:40.305 --> 00:22:42.345
She even drove you back and forth
during university.

00:22:45.281 --> 00:22:47.285
But Grandma never cares about me.

00:22:47.835 --> 00:22:49.537
Even Tankhun cares about me more.

00:22:52.655 --> 00:22:53.897
What are you thinking?

00:22:54.641 --> 00:22:56.645
Maybe scars can go away.

00:22:58.015 --> 00:22:59.513
What the hell are you thinking?

00:23:00.105 --> 00:23:02.889
It’s as strange as it is.

00:23:03.405 --> 00:23:05.153
If I’m a little more superstitious,

00:23:05.925 --> 00:23:07.321
I would think you’re bewitched.

00:23:09.765 --> 00:23:10.961
Then tell me,

00:23:11.725 --> 00:23:13.433
what is there for him to fool me for?

00:23:13.785 --> 00:23:15.505
What do I have for him to fool me?

00:23:16.175 --> 00:23:19.065
And now he’s the only one who protects me

00:23:19.545 --> 00:23:21.545
and tries to trace back my memory.

00:23:22.805 --> 00:23:24.081
Listen to me.

00:23:24.935 --> 00:23:26.777
I’ll find out that answer for you.

00:23:26.793 --> 00:23:28.537
About why he’s being nice to you.

00:23:29.495 --> 00:23:31.169
And I’ll prove it to you.

00:23:31.209 --> 00:23:34.025
That this Tankhun is not the real one.

00:23:34.795 --> 00:23:37.169
And he’s approaching you for something

00:23:37.765 --> 00:23:39.097
and it’s not love.

00:23:41.445 --> 00:23:42.445
Go ahead.

00:23:43.015 --> 00:23:44.465
I’ll prove it too.

00:23:44.765 --> 00:23:46.481
That this Tankhun is the real one.

00:23:47.145 --> 00:23:48.753
And what’s happening between us

00:23:48.785 --> 00:23:50.257
is love, indeed.

00:24:24.085 --> 00:24:25.513
Would you like to relive the past?

00:24:48.085 --> 00:24:49.577
Can you remember

00:24:50.035 --> 00:24:51.665
what we did here?

00:25:00.195 --> 00:25:01.195
Hey!

00:25:02.915 --> 00:25:04.201
What are you doing?

00:25:07.175 --> 00:25:08.465
Reliving the past.

00:25:35.965 --> 00:25:37.257
You and I

00:25:39.085 --> 00:25:40.329
we did it here?

00:25:59.795 --> 00:26:00.849
What are you thinking?

00:26:01.125 --> 00:26:02.125
Pervert.

00:26:23.497 --> 00:26:24.497
You got it?

00:26:25.205 --> 00:26:26.205
Almost.

00:26:31.135 --> 00:26:32.905
Reminds me of when we were 17.

00:26:33.715 --> 00:26:35.729
I stole a potato from the farm nearby

00:26:36.475 --> 00:26:38.753
not a sweet potato bought
from a supermarket like today.

00:26:42.085 --> 00:26:43.937
I said I wanted grilled potatoes

00:26:44.665 --> 00:26:46.145
so you made a campfire for me.

00:26:48.345 --> 00:26:49.625
Took you so long to light it up.

00:26:51.015 --> 00:26:52.495
It didn’t even taste good in the end.

00:26:52.625 --> 00:26:53.833
Because it was a cassava.

00:26:54.985 --> 00:26:56.801
And I was so unlucky that I got caught.

00:26:57.855 --> 00:26:59.177
When I got back,

00:26:59.515 --> 00:27:01.089
my ears were full of my mom’s scolds.

00:27:01.975 --> 00:27:04.177
You can remember now?

00:27:05.885 --> 00:27:07.281
I remember from the diary.

00:27:08.225 --> 00:27:10.065
Actually, I still can’t remember a thing.

00:27:21.015 --> 00:27:22.481
You have me, Pleng.

00:27:23.975 --> 00:27:25.553
I will help you recall your memory.

00:27:36.697 --> 00:27:37.697
A-hem.

00:27:39.225 --> 00:27:41.297
Though a grilled cassava doesn’t taste good,

00:27:41.785 --> 00:27:43.785
it could ease your grumbling belly, Pleng.

00:27:46.525 --> 00:27:48.193
Though we don’t have the cassava,

00:27:48.815 --> 00:27:51.017
I will eat up all the grilled sweet potatoes.

00:27:54.695 --> 00:27:55.695
By the way,

00:27:57.005 --> 00:27:58.273
will you light up the fire now?

00:28:01.665 --> 00:28:03.209
I think if we wait until the fire is lit up,

00:28:03.233 --> 00:28:04.777
you would be starving to death, Pleng.

00:28:05.195 --> 00:28:06.649
I’ve prepared some sandwiches in the car.

00:28:06.665 --> 00:28:07.697
Have that for now.

00:28:08.155 --> 00:28:09.217
I’ll get it for you.

00:28:57.915 --> 00:29:02.257
HORROR!! FISHING LINE
BODY JAMMED INSIDE A LUGGAGE

00:29:04.255 --> 00:29:05.737
(The autopsy confirms that)

00:29:05.761 --> 00:29:07.857
(both bodies died in the same manner.)

00:29:08.215 --> 00:29:10.113
(That is strangling with garrote knots.)

00:29:13.825 --> 00:29:14.825
Pleng!

00:29:15.815 --> 00:29:16.881
Leave this place.

00:29:17.205 --> 00:29:18.377
Unless you want to die.

00:29:20.535 --> 00:29:21.535
Hey!

00:29:23.015 --> 00:29:24.015
Argh!

00:29:27.465 --> 00:29:28.465
Urgh!

00:29:57.525 --> 00:29:58.525
Urgh!

00:30:00.345 --> 00:30:01.345
Urgh!

00:30:01.845 --> 00:30:02.845
Pleng!

00:30:06.315 --> 00:30:07.315
Pleng!

00:30:07.645 --> 00:30:08.645
Pleng!

00:30:08.835 --> 00:30:09.835
Pleng!

00:30:10.145 --> 00:30:11.145
Pleng!

00:30:19.655 --> 00:30:20.169
Pleng.

00:30:20.475 --> 00:30:21.475
Breathe slowly.

00:30:21.673 --> 00:30:22.353
Breathe slowly.

00:30:22.377 --> 00:30:23.377
I’m here.

00:30:23.485 --> 00:30:25.017
Pleng, breathe slowly.

00:30:25.035 --> 00:30:25.897
Breathe slowly.

00:30:25.921 --> 00:30:26.921
I’m here.

00:30:37.515 --> 00:30:38.515
Pleng.

00:30:38.715 --> 00:30:39.785
I’m Tankhun.

00:30:40.245 --> 00:30:41.433
Your lover.

00:30:45.435 --> 00:30:46.435
Tan.

00:30:48.185 --> 00:30:49.521
Don’t ever leave me again.

00:30:54.245 --> 00:30:55.245
It’s alright.

00:30:55.645 --> 00:30:56.705
I’m here.

00:30:57.515 --> 00:30:59.009
No one can hurt you.

00:30:59.775 --> 00:31:01.001
I’ll protect you.

00:31:16.325 --> 00:31:17.921
Thank you so much, doctor,

00:31:17.953 --> 00:31:19.925
for accepting our interview.

00:31:20.255 --> 00:31:21.161
I’ve heard that

00:31:21.193 --> 00:31:24.713
NewsDay Deeply likes to
interview people of different occupations.

00:31:24.777 --> 00:31:26.105
But I didn’t know

00:31:26.145 --> 00:31:28.881
the owner himself would be interviewing me.

00:31:30.065 --> 00:31:31.273
Um… the thing is

00:31:31.305 --> 00:31:33.881
I only interview those I’m interested in.

00:31:34.765 --> 00:31:36.049
Let’s not waste time

00:31:36.065 --> 00:31:37.553
and jump right to the point.

00:31:38.485 --> 00:31:40.817
I would like to know about your background

00:31:40.841 --> 00:31:43.289
before starting Jennaree Podcast

00:31:43.321 --> 00:31:45.937
until you become Gen Z’s favorite
psychiatrist.

00:31:47.375 --> 00:31:49.713
It started because I studied in the UK
since I was young,

00:31:49.745 --> 00:31:51.715
I almost didn’t have any Thai friends.

00:31:51.737 --> 00:31:53.473
I wanted to speak Thai

00:31:53.521 --> 00:31:55.337
and share knowledge about psychology

00:31:55.361 --> 00:31:56.193
so I started the podcast–

00:31:56.225 --> 00:31:57.225
Um, doctor…

00:31:57.897 --> 00:31:59.895
Before we get into the podcast,

00:32:00.445 --> 00:32:01.121
the thing is,

00:32:01.445 --> 00:32:03.281
I want some new information.

00:32:03.321 --> 00:32:06.057
The fresh interview that

00:32:06.073 --> 00:32:08.055
you’ve never done anywhere before.

00:32:09.265 --> 00:32:10.417
How?

00:32:11.365 --> 00:32:12.769
Exclusive.

00:32:13.165 --> 00:32:14.725
Diving deep into your personal matters.

00:32:15.755 --> 00:32:18.249
I believe your fans

00:32:18.273 --> 00:32:20.177
would want to get to know you

00:32:20.193 --> 00:32:21.697
on a deeper aspect.

00:32:21.729 --> 00:32:23.033
For example...

00:32:23.325 --> 00:32:26.017
What sort of family did you grow up in?

00:32:27.285 --> 00:32:28.617
How many siblings?

00:32:29.395 --> 00:32:30.769
Are you close to your siblings?

00:32:31.265 --> 00:32:32.265
Things like that.

00:32:34.895 --> 00:32:36.337
I think my fans

00:32:36.353 --> 00:32:37.457
probably wouldn’t be curious

00:32:37.481 --> 00:32:39.713
about my personal matters.

00:32:40.315 --> 00:32:41.825
They’re more interested in

00:32:41.849 --> 00:32:44.209
the ways I can heal their hearts.

00:32:44.795 --> 00:32:47.209
Let’s continue talking about my career.

00:32:47.415 --> 00:32:48.289
Um…

00:32:48.313 --> 00:32:52.121
But doctor, personal matters
is a good resource to draw attention.

00:32:52.795 --> 00:32:55.153
For the psychological matters,

00:32:55.201 --> 00:32:57.155
I think one can just listen to your podcast.

00:32:58.055 --> 00:33:00.465
Today, I’d like to ask you
about your personal matters.

00:33:05.205 --> 00:33:06.205
Or…

00:33:06.645 --> 00:33:09.689
Do you not want to talk about your family?

00:33:11.285 --> 00:33:12.625
Is there any secrets?

00:33:16.761 --> 00:33:18.765
Your behavior, Mr. Muenmile,

00:33:18.785 --> 00:33:20.481
is actually of someone with secrets.

00:33:21.169 --> 00:33:23.165
You didn’t really want to interview me.

00:33:23.995 --> 00:33:25.609
What exactly do you want?

00:33:52.345 --> 00:33:55.497
Even if I can’t remember the time
I had a lover 10 years ago,

00:33:57.935 --> 00:33:59.033
but now I know

00:33:59.865 --> 00:34:02.049
how good it feels to have a lover
taking care of me

00:34:02.505 --> 00:34:04.505
Then you had better get used to it.

00:34:05.155 --> 00:34:06.449
Because you will be
taken good care of like this

00:34:06.473 --> 00:34:07.473
for a long time.

00:34:08.695 --> 00:34:09.695
No wonder why

00:34:10.725 --> 00:34:13.089
I seem head over heels for you in my diary.

00:34:15.435 --> 00:34:16.721
Because you’re this nice.

00:34:24.915 --> 00:34:26.121
You got hurt because of me.

00:34:27.335 --> 00:34:28.353
I’m okay.

00:34:31.805 --> 00:34:33.521
But from now on

00:34:34.289 --> 00:34:36.285
you might become the murderer’s target.

00:34:38.045 --> 00:34:39.217
That means

00:34:40.585 --> 00:34:43.657
the person I met today was the murderer?

00:34:44.505 --> 00:34:45.921
I’m just speculating.

00:34:46.753 --> 00:34:48.755
You might know the real identity
of the murderer

00:34:49.325 --> 00:34:51.177
that’s why he’s threatening you.

00:34:51.645 --> 00:34:53.329
You should stop covering this case.

00:34:54.273 --> 00:34:55.921
He might do worse.

00:34:59.545 --> 00:35:01.065
Please stop covering this case, Pleng.

00:35:13.977 --> 00:35:15.975
I thought you would understand me more.

00:35:19.241 --> 00:35:20.265
I’m saying this

00:35:21.125 --> 00:35:22.177
because I care about you.

00:35:23.675 --> 00:35:24.675
You know what?

00:35:25.775 --> 00:35:27.689
Ever since I lost my memory,

00:35:28.055 --> 00:35:29.945
I’m so sick of the word “care”.

00:35:31.121 --> 00:35:33.125
Mom, Grandma, and my friend.

00:35:34.725 --> 00:35:37.689
No one lets me do what I want for once.

00:35:40.335 --> 00:35:41.889
Because of the word “care”.

00:35:42.725 --> 00:35:44.353
Because they want the best for you.

00:35:46.161 --> 00:35:47.193
I know.

00:35:48.425 --> 00:35:50.833
But don’t you think I also care about myself?

00:35:51.405 --> 00:35:52.625
What I’m doing now

00:35:52.649 --> 00:35:53.969
is my own choice.

00:35:54.595 --> 00:35:56.089
Also, it’s my life, isn’t it?

00:35:57.095 --> 00:35:59.817
Why does everyone act like my life is theirs?

00:36:01.409 --> 00:36:03.405
Is it hard to just support me?

00:36:04.615 --> 00:36:05.615
Pleng.

00:36:07.515 --> 00:36:08.825
Can you not leave just yet?

00:36:09.515 --> 00:36:10.515
I’m sorry.

00:36:12.675 --> 00:36:14.145
Let me be on my own for a bit.

00:36:26.705 --> 00:36:27.937
How is it going?

00:36:28.495 --> 00:36:30.089
Did you get anything from the CCTV?

00:36:31.725 --> 00:36:34.297
There was no bike without a plate
like you described.

00:36:34.785 --> 00:36:36.001
You have to understand,

00:36:36.025 --> 00:36:37.289
this is in the countryside,

00:36:37.645 --> 00:36:38.865
there aren’t many CCTVs.

00:36:38.913 --> 00:36:41.297
The place you went to
was also very deserted.

00:36:44.365 --> 00:36:45.817
Then what are you going to do next?

00:36:46.297 --> 00:36:48.537
Are you going to let the witness
be the target like this?

00:36:51.855 --> 00:36:54.321
You want me to send some officers
to protect Botpleng, right?

00:36:54.635 --> 00:36:56.177
Isn’t that the police’s duty?

00:36:56.725 --> 00:36:58.217
If I weren’t there that day,

00:36:58.525 --> 00:37:00.129
Botpleng could have been a victim.

00:37:00.405 --> 00:37:02.249
I know you care about him

00:37:02.705 --> 00:37:05.265
but he’s not weak and fragile like you think.

00:37:08.205 --> 00:37:09.205
See?

00:37:09.765 --> 00:37:11.657
He’s so strong.

00:37:12.755 --> 00:37:15.265
Even without you, he can protect himself.

00:37:21.685 --> 00:37:23.225
But why, on that day,

00:37:24.555 --> 00:37:26.355
he didn’t seem to be able to protect himself?

00:37:27.015 --> 00:37:28.385
Maybe because you were there.

00:37:29.845 --> 00:37:30.761
So he wanted to be weak

00:37:30.801 --> 00:37:32.161
to have you take care of him.

00:37:34.035 --> 00:37:35.225
Just pulling your legs.

00:37:35.945 --> 00:37:38.689
Still, a criminal is more threatening than I am.

00:37:39.485 --> 00:37:42.497
I’ll get the protective police sorted.

00:37:43.225 --> 00:37:44.793
But Botpleng is quite odd.

00:37:45.455 --> 00:37:47.377
After being threatened in person like that,

00:37:47.409 --> 00:37:48.961
other people would have been scared.

00:37:49.965 --> 00:37:51.689
But he still wants to cover the case.

00:37:52.125 --> 00:37:53.685
Don’t you think that’s pretty fearless?

00:38:00.793 --> 00:38:03.897
(Yes, I’m also curious)

00:38:03.921 --> 00:38:06.649
(what your true self is like.)

00:38:17.845 --> 00:38:18.845
Tankhun.

00:38:21.755 --> 00:38:23.025
What are you doing here?

00:38:23.765 --> 00:38:24.817
I miss you.

00:38:27.685 --> 00:38:29.085
What if you came and I wasn’t here?

00:38:29.655 --> 00:38:30.655
Well…

00:38:33.595 --> 00:38:35.313
Probably staring at your roof instead?

00:38:35.865 --> 00:38:36.905
So you’re all the way here

00:38:37.681 --> 00:38:39.685
to stare at my roof?

00:38:41.215 --> 00:38:42.297
To make it up to you.

00:38:51.035 --> 00:38:52.681
Forgive me, Pleng.

00:38:57.365 --> 00:38:58.857
With a cassava?

00:38:58.873 --> 00:38:59.753
Seriously?

00:38:59.785 --> 00:39:00.785
Well…

00:39:01.975 --> 00:39:03.681
You said you wanted to relive the past.

00:39:14.465 --> 00:39:17.025
You’re making it up to me
with something that doesn’t taste good?

00:39:20.355 --> 00:39:21.355
What is it now?

00:39:23.535 --> 00:39:24.841
It’s hard to swallow.

00:39:25.975 --> 00:39:27.415
Got to wash it down with some water.

00:39:31.485 --> 00:39:32.725
Is this what you call romantic?

00:39:47.475 --> 00:39:48.475
Have some.

00:39:57.075 --> 00:39:58.489
Our memory

00:39:59.065 --> 00:40:00.241
doesn’t taste good at all.

00:40:17.635 --> 00:40:19.281
Then let’s create new memories.

00:40:57.505 --> 00:40:59.505
Get washed up and hurry home.

00:40:59.537 --> 00:41:00.713
My grandma will be back soon.

00:41:01.405 --> 00:41:03.009
Am I your secret now?

00:41:03.735 --> 00:41:05.601
I’d rather you be the truth.

00:41:06.405 --> 00:41:08.753
The truth that no one can take you away from me.

00:41:09.445 --> 00:41:11.769
The link between the two is

00:41:12.405 --> 00:41:14.577
they both used to work for the Thayadon family.

00:41:15.325 --> 00:41:16.873
I’m taking up the case because of you.

00:41:16.905 --> 00:41:17.217
LIKE.

00:41:17.525 --> 00:41:19.009
Who would ever let their first love

00:41:19.033 --> 00:41:20.553
go through such a dreadful case alone?

00:41:21.535 --> 00:41:24.505
Look for infamous news about Botpleng’s father.

00:41:25.205 --> 00:41:26.205
Dig deep.

00:41:26.635 --> 00:41:27.681
Tonight…

00:41:28.235 --> 00:41:29.321
Can I sleep with you?

00:41:32.365 --> 00:41:33.377
I just want to

00:41:34.635 --> 00:41:36.065
relive the memory.

00:41:41.845 --> 00:41:43.593
You’re looking for your older brother, right?

00:41:43.617 --> 00:41:44.921
The one who’s with you now

00:41:44.961 --> 00:41:46.297
is not Tankhun.

00:41:46.825 --> 00:41:49.089
That’s why you can’t remember him.

00:41:49.105 --> 00:41:51.521
Even if I don’t have the memory of 10 years ago,

00:41:51.561 --> 00:41:53.969
I think I have made new memories now.

00:41:54.345 --> 00:41:55.345
I like you.

00:41:55.655 --> 00:41:57.095
Will you please never be gone again?
