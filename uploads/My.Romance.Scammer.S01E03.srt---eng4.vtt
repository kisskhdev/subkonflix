WEBVTT

00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.240
You don’t know who he is.

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.880
How can you love him?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.640
Why don’t we get to know
each other right now?

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.200
You watch my back.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.440
I’ll watch your back.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.040
Nana.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.360
Look U up for me.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.680
What do you think you’re doing?

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.760
This is so disrespectful
to me and my husband!

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.720
Pai.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.680
I want to be alone right now.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.080
There’s no way I can let that happen.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.760
Come here.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.080
You’re adorable when you’re angry.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.160
Are you sad because of what I said?

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.000
You make a face like a little duckling
when you’re sad.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.800
Don’t be sad again, you hear me?

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.920
Well?

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.560
Everything okay on your end now?

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.200
Pai took some painkillers and went to bed.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.040
Same here.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.600
These cousins are adorable, aren’t they?

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.120
Stop that nonsense!

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.960
Don’t you know that
ever since you came into the picture,

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.200
Pai barely thinks about getting married.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.400
It’s affecting me!

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.200
Well, help me out then.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.000
When Mr. Pai and North stop fighting,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.360
we can both do our own things.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.120
That line of thinking doesn’t work on Pai.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.720
Which line of thinking works on him,
then, Mr. Pai’s Boyfriend?

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.560
Listen to me.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.000
Pai doesn’t trust you
because he doesn’t know you.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.800
The further you bring North away from him,
the more worried he gets.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.160
You need to gain his trust.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.040
That’s how we end this, you got it?

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.800
How can I even do that?

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.360
He won’t even look at me.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.240
I have an idea.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.120
We have to start tomorrow, though.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.760
Our targets are vulnerable right now.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.640
This is when we strike and knock them out.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.240
Okay.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.640
What’s the plan?

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.160
North.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.160
North.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.160
Wake up.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.480
Go get ready.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.720
Can I have one more hour?

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.680
Let’s go talk to Mr. Pai.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.240
What’s more to talk about?

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.160
We’re all good, right?

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.360
Things are all good with you,

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.560
but apparently not with me.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.560
I want to win him over, too, you know?

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.280
You don’t need to.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.240
It’s too much trouble.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.080
We’re better off staying away from him.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.360
Wait.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.040
North.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.760
Think about it.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.400
The longer we keep our relationship
secret from Grandpa,

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.960
the worse he’s going to think of us.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.280
If we want to be openly in love
in front of Grandpa,

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.800
we need to get through Mr. Pai’s first.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.240
Please?

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.640
No more sleep.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.800
I don’t want to be your secret husband.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.000
I want to be the husband
you can be proud of.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.880
Please?

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.120
Alright.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.120
Let’s get you dressed, then.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.520
Let me sleep in a little more, first.

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.640
I’m still tired.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:19.960
I’ll join you, then.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.720
Hey, I thought we’re going to sleep.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.520
Sure.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.280
(North agreed. We’ll be at his office today.)

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.600
Where are you going today, baby?

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.880
You’re up early.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.120
We have an appointment with Nana
about wedding planners.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.600
We do.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.520
I was busy worrying about North
so I… forgot.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.920
It’s alright.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.000
I understand.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.200
I know you’re tired.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.680
Can we stay like this for a minute?

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.920
I had such a bad headache last night.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.560
This is nice.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.680
Don’t stop, baby.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.600
What’s wrong?

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.120
Oh…

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.000
It’s just you aren’t usually so affectionate.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.040
I don’t know what to do.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.120
I told you I’m just tired.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.240
What’s with you?

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.000
Me?

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.960
You have this awkward look
on your face.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.840
Just like when we started dating.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.760
Awkward?

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.040
Why would I be awkward?

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.080
But look at you trying to
keep your hands busy.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.520
But why would I be awkward?

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.640
I should be the one asking.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:50.840
Oh!

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.640
Look at me.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.280
My hair is a mess. My eyes are swollen.
My nose is red.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.160
Why didn’t you say anything?

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Because there was nothing to say.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.360
You look adorable.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.800
You’re being so weird.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.200
Weird?

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.720
I’m not being weird.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.600
It’s not weird.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:14.600
You need my help with that?

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.520
I got it.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:16.320
I totally got it.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.320
You go and get ready.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.120
Wear your belt properly.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.360
Your fly is down.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.280
Pai!

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.520
Get dressed properly.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.280
Why don’t you get ready?

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.080
I’ll wait outside.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.320
Bye.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.360
Go straight ahead.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.440
Please be careful.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.160
Those files are important.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.400
Proceed carefully, please.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.040
Turn left.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.840
Oh, sorry. It’s the room on the right.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.280
Sir, careful with that photo.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:45.760
Nana.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:46.760
Yes?

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.080
What’s going on?

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.520
Mrs. Kia wants to set up
her private office here.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:53.960
Why?

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.160
I don’t know, sir.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.280
Why the long face?

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.160
Isn’t that good?

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.520
Aunt Kia will stay away
from your office from now on.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.080
That’s not a bad thing, actually.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.080
Just be out of each other's hair
so we don’t have to argue.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.320
She’s just looking out for you guys.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.360
It’s just her way of showing she cares.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.120
Don’t worry about it.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.480
I want to be half as patient as you, baby.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.360
Let’s get to work, shall we?

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.040
“Baby.”

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.160
Nana.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.200
Yes.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.000
Here.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.960
I picked out only the planners
who have managed weddings

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.880
for celebrities, politicians,
and businessmen.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.520
I guarantee they will do a good job
for your and Mr. Tim’s wedding.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.080
I went to almost all of these weddings.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.680
All they’re concerned about
are their images.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.720
Tears of joy or otherwise, everyone has to
get it together for some photos.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.200
Can you find me more genuine planners?

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:02.240
Of course.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.440
Lively and genui—

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.920
You should have knocked.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.200
I didn’t realize aunties needed to.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.000
Even Grandpa does.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.120
Fine, sure, of course.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.280
No one is above you in this company, Pai.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.360
You can order anyone around,
or overlook them, for that matter.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.440
Even our Master.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.040
Why don’t you say
what you’re here to say, Auntie?

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.840
I will be working here from now on.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:47.560
I heard work has been neglected lately
for personal pleasure.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.800
I never do that.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.120
How do you know that, Pai,

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.720
when no one seems to dare
to oppose you or give you a lesson?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.600
Of course, everyone is telling you
you’re doing a good job to your face.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.440
Behind your back, they’re all complaining
about how tired they are of you.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.760
It’s not me, sir!

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.000
I am never tired!

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.720
Without your money,
who’d even put up with you?

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.000
I have to sacrifice my time to take care—

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.760
If it is so much trouble for you,
stay away, Auntie.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.360
No one opposes Pai
because they respect his judgement.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.480
You should try that, too, Auntie,

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.200
if you still know what to do.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:29.400
Nana.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:30.360
Yes?

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.360
Show Aunt Kia to the meeting room.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:33.960
Da Zhan.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:34.960
Let’s go.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:36.760
Da Zhan.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.480
Make yourself scarce.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:39.720
Let adults talk.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:41.880
This way, please.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.320
I don’t need a chaperone.
I know my way around.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:56.360
Baby.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.080
Are you alright?

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:01.760
I’m fine.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.040
I’m going to step out for some fresh air.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:31.960
I’m sorry, Pai.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.040
I’ll apologize to Aunt Kia right away.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.600
Take your time to feel better first.

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.880
I feel awful.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.120
You didn’t need to see that.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.200
You totally surprised me.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.400
It wasn’t like you.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.840
I promise I won’t let it happen again.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.880
Aunt Kia is infuriating.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.280
It took you a long time to explode.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.840
That was already impressively calm of you.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:13.440
You’re…

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.320
Not mad at me?

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.200
You were so cool.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.120
You should get angry more often.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.560
This is no time to be joking, you know?

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.080
Alright.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.640
To be honest, it’s like I just got to
know you even better.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.440
I loved it.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:55.960
Damn it.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:56.600
The hell?

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:57.840
What the hell was wrong with me?

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.360
The Tim everyone knows
is a calm and collected guy,

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.440
but I had to freaking snap.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.640
You let your intrusive thoughts win, huh.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.280
Do I look like I’m in a laughing mood?

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.880
Well, after he saw your rotten nature—

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:19.200
I mean, after he saw your ‘true colors,’
how did he take it?

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.200
He loved it.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:33.000
Well.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:34.120
There ya go.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.680
Another fan of the red flag, I guess.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.040
You know what?

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:38.560
Screw it.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.680
I promise I won’t lose control
like that again.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.120
What made you snap, though?

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.040
That aunt of his is always nagging, right?

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.200
But Pai was tired today.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.000
He went through something last night.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.520
He barely got any sleep and his head hurt.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:55.760
Don’t you think that’s frustrating?

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.280
Can’t she let my boyfriend have
even a minute of peace?

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:00.680
Bro.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.960
Snap out of it.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.400
You call him your “boyfriend” now?

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.040
Not your “target?”

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:10.440
“Target,” my ass.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.880
This ain’t freaking archery.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:13.640
You dare talk back to me?

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:14.280
Careful.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.720
- Oh, bring it.
- Yeah?

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.600
I ain’t scared of you.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:17.640
What?

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.480
I think you clocked yourself
getting soft on him

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.880
and needed me here
to help you snap out of it.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.000
Alright.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.440
I’ll slap some sense into you.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.000
What?

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:34.880
What’s that?

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.200
Oh, now why the hell are you
ruining it like that—

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:45.320
Do. Not. Fall. For. Your. Target.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:46.600
At all costs!

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:48.760
I’m… I’m not—

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.000
You’re welcome.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.800
I’m not falling for my target.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.160
I’m just…

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:03.120
seeing him differently
because I saw a part of him that…

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.520
A part of him that makes me protective.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.680
But I don’t feel differently.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:25.680
Yeah.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.560
If that’s the case, then bravo.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:33.200
But to hear the word “protective”
come out of your mouth.

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:35.720
It can’t be good.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.520
Hong.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.520
What’s wrong with you today?

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.600
Are you bored?

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.360
You’ve been awfully quiet.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.160
Sorry?

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.120
You weren’t listening, were you?

00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:59.640
I’m sorry.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.040
I just happen to have
a lot on my mind lately.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.160
Are you going through something?

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.680
You can tell me, you know?

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:13.480
For you, I’m willing to help
anyway that I can.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:16.200
You’re too nice to worry about me.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.280
I’m going to fall head over heels
for you at this rate.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.560
Oh, Hong, you.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.640
Your mouth is as sweet as your face!

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.560
You adorable thing!

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:28.840
Oh?

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.080
Hong.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.440
I have to take this call.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:33.880
- Of course.
- I’ll be right back.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.160
Of course, Airy.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.160
Uncle, buy me the plushie.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:04.480
“Uncle”?

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.080
Kid.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.760
Can you let Uncle have this one?

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.920
You pick any of these.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:18.680
Maybe this one?

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.360
It’s bigger.

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:19.880
Or this?

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.680
I want this one.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:22.520
No way.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.480
I told you I want it!

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:29.840
How much is this?

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:30.640
My son!

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.440
Are you alright?

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.000
Let’s go to a different store.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:39.800
Hong.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:40.200
Yes?

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.600
Is everything okay?

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.360
Yes, it is.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.680
Oh, is this for me?

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.400
It’s not!

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:52.040
Oh, I mean, you don’t deserve
a plushie like this.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:55.560
You deserve something
pretty and beautiful.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.320
If it’s not for me, who is it for?

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.200
It’s for some kid in my neighborhood.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.000
He happens to look
exactly like this plushie.

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.360
I thought I’d buy it for him.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.640
Oh, you must really adore
this random kid, then?

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.920
If you don’t adore him, things like this
wouldn’t remind you of him.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.080
I see.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.600
Hong, there’s something I want over there.

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:25.560
Come shopping with me.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.120
Let’s go shopping, shall we?

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.160
You make a face like a little duckling
when you’re sad.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:49.920
Duckling?

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:51.200
Yeah.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.480
There’s nothing else today, is there?

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.040
There is.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.040
Mr. North asks to see you, Mr. Pai.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:21.880
North wants to talk to me?

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:22.560
Yes.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.880
Mr. North is waiting outside, with Mr. U.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.280
Shall I bring them in?

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.400
Bring—

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.560
We were kept waiting forever!

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.040
You should have knocked.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:37.360
I didn’t know I needed to.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.160
What did you need to talk to me about?

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:42.640
I didn’t.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.120
U did.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:45.240
Go on.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.520
I wanted to invite you over
for dinner at home.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.120
We’ll have a small party
and cook something.

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.520
We can get to know each other better.

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.640
I’ll see if I’m free.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.280
Just name the day.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.800
If we wait for you, it will never happen.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.120
You can pick any day, Mr. Pai.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.120
We’re alright with anything.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:05.760
I see.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:07.840
I don’t think I’m free at all this year.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:08.920
Maybe next year.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:12.760
Ms. Nana.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:13.280
Yes!

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.040
Oh…

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:22.200
Mr. Pai is busy all through this month.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.120
What about tonight?

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.080
Any time is fine.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.800
Wouldn’t it be too soon, North?

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:32.480
He’s right, North.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.240
When does Pai get off work tonight?

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.400
At half past seven.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.840
We’ll see you at U’s place at 8.30.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:39.520
- North!
- What?

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:40.840
It’s settled!

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:52.840
What?

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.080
You’ll only be free at 8, Mama?

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.160
Can you call the real estate place
to sort out the house first?

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.800
(Alright.)

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.840
(Good thing I took some photos
of what was where.)

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:05.680
(I’ll get it done.)

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:06.240
Right.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:07.280
Thanks.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.000
See you.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.000
North.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.640
They even have coconuts, U. Look.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:22.560
What are all these for?

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:23.880
What are we making?

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.480
I don’t know.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.840
I’m grabbing everything just in case.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.880
What do you think we can make
out of these?

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:32.480
Uh…

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:35.880
I don’t know.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.080
I don’t cook.

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:38.000
Oh?

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:39.120
Oh?

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:40.600
Oh.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:50.120
Two bitter melons, some young
pork ribs, whole white pepper,

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.320
and minced garlic.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:53.880
…Garlic.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:54.800
Yes, sir.

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:58.880
Come in.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.720
Oh, you don’t need to knock, baby.

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:06.240
It’s okay.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.720
What are you doing?

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:12.280
I got your text saying
we’re having dinner at U’s.

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.040
What is that all about?

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:16.800
North forced my hand.

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.360
So I thought I might as well
show off my best dish.

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.760
I’ll go get the ingredients ready for you, sir.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.400
Are you going to cook?

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.800
Don’t tell me you finally give in.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:33.920
No.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.280
This is an opportunity to show North that

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.480
U can’t take care of him
as well as our family does.

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.640
This bitter melon herbal soup is unrivaled.

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.160
CLOSED!

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:01.560
Your friend is a pastry chef, isn’t he?

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.800
He can do anything.

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:08.560
The drink and dessert menus of this place
are all his doing.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.200
Of course, they are

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.160
when a partner like you never bothers
to show up.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.880
I even have to mop the floor myself.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.040
Let me see.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:22.840
Impressive.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:27.240
You finally made the perfect
fried fish after five tries.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.880
If I knew you’d wasted all those sea bass, I’d have made you practice on tilapia.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.280
I’m nervous.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:37.280
Let me try it.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:55.640
Let’s go.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.440
What’s wrong?

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:10.360
I know we haven’t started
but I’m already tired.

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.640
Maybe we can just make a run for it?

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.160
North, hold on.

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:18.720
We’ve been practicing.
There’s no need to run.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:20.040
Stay.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.480
U, it’s not the cooking that exhausts me.

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:29.120
Just the thought of
having a long conversation with Pai

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.240
makes me tired.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.920
Can I ask you honestly?

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.040
Why do you always avoid him?

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.320
Wow.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:58.920
The ubiquitous half-used limes.

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.360
They’re really doing a good job
setting up this place.

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:03.920
I’ll get them.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:04.680
Okay.

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:12.880
Come on in.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:21.080
Please, come in.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:22.680
Please.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:26.920
Hello.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.480
How was traffic?

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.120
Typical.

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.280
North, where’s the bathroom?

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:34.520
- It’s…
- Over there.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:39.840
Baby.

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:40.720
Yes?

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:41.800
How’d you know that?

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:46.120
I mean, it’s a common house plan.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.160
You walk in and the bathroom
is usually the first room you see.

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.080
Why don’t you go?

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:50.200
Hurry up.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:50.960
Go on.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.240
Where’s your mother, U?

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.880
Oh, Mom went to Chiang Mai
with her friends.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.960
But she’s catching a flight back.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.320
Oh, too bad Chiang
didn’t get to stay longer.

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.680
What is that you have with you?

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:15.760
Pai said he’d cook.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:16.880
These are the ingredients.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.400
Do you cook?

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:30.440
little.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.360
Help me, then.

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.560
We can get to know each other better.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.720
Of course, Mr. Pai.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:42.160
North and Mr. Tim,
please make yourselves at home.

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.360
No need for the ‘mister.’

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:47.920
Tim, it is.

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:52.240
U.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.560
Right. Please.

00:26:58.840 --> 00:26:59.960
Do your best.

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:09.360
Do you think… they’re going to be alright?

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:10.720
I guess so.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.640
You wanna be in there with them

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.040
just in case?

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:15.200
Yeah.

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:17.000
Let me help.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.160
I also want to cook.

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:19.600
Get on it.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:38.400
I’m here to officially ask for
Pai’s hand in marriage to Tim.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:39.680
Holy crap!

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:42.000
Baby?

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:43.040
Yes?

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:43.960
Are you alright?

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.640
Oh, it’s… Holy crap!

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:48.480
Wow!

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.400
U is a talented guy, baby!

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:52.920
He is?

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:53.480
Yeah.

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:54.800
Come and look, baby.

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:55.760
What?

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:56.400
Look.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:00.040
He’s an arm-wrestling champion…
in third grade.

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.960
You were in an arm wrestling contest
in elementary school?

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.200
I was.

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:18.680
Wait.

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.000
Who on earth rang their own doorbell?

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.080
Baby.

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.120
Y–Yes?

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:36.560
I need to pee.

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:37.200
I’ll be right back.

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.680
I can’t hold it in anymore.

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.280
Goosebumps and all that.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.760
(U and I can’t have the same mother!)

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.440
(Go home. I’ll handle this.)

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:11.320
Baby.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:11.960
Yes?

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:13.000
What’s wrong?.

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:14.640
Oh, it’s nothing.

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:18.000
was just checking out the door over here
and I thought…

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:22.120
The architect didn’t do a good job.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.040
U. U!

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:24.920
U, hey!

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:25.600
Yes?

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:26.800
Do you need my help?

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:27.480
It’s alright.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.640
I’ll handle it. I’m an architect, remember?

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.680
You just stay put, Pai.
Alright?

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.160
U!

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:33.240
What?

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.680
Your door is broken.

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.440
Let’s come and take a look outside.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:37.800
My door?

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.840
It’s so badly done!

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:45.600
Come here, you.

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:46.760
That was a close call.

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.160
If I didn’t see Mama Oom,

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.680
we’d have to come up with a sob story
about how we’re two estranged brothers.

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:51.400
ap!

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:52.640
You hired her, too?

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:53.200
Hell yeah.

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.040
That was so close.

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.280
What do we do now?

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.720
I’ll get back inside first.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.160
You follow me later.

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.280
You have to tell Pai that
your mother can’t make it anymore.

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.240
Okay.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.880
And you’ll have to keep letting Pai
take his frustration out on you.

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:08.960
Damn it.

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:10.560
You almost blew it.

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.480
Everyone’s taking their frustration
out on me right now, apparently.

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:19.000
I can help with this, you know?

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.520
Give it here.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:22.880
North.

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:24.240
Fine.

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.520
Is there anything I can help you with?

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.760
Mr. Pai.

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.880
There’s a big thunderstorm in Chiang Mai.

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.840
My mother’s flight is delayed.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:42.680
I don’t want her to keep waiting
for her flight like this.

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:46.520
You should tell your mother

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:47.880
Right.

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.440
I’m sorry about this.

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.160
I’ll tell her.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:56.600
All done.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:59.000
Come and help me in the kitchen.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.320
Yes, Mr. Pai.

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.160
Why don’t you go set up the table, North?

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:08.400
But if I leave you alone with U like this,

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.920
are you sure you won’t start fighting?

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:13.360
How about this, guys?

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:17.120
Let’s set up a table and have dinner

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:18.800
on the front lawn outside?

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:20.640
Come on, North.

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.960
Get back to work.

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:29.760
Yes, sir.

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:38.800
Don’t worry.

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:40.360
Pai won’t hurt U.

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.280
I cannot not worry, Tim.

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.440
Forget about them getting along,

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:51.480
just convincing Pai that U and I really
are in love seems almost impossible.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.040
What makes you so in love, though?

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.760
Didn’t you guys just meet?

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:08.840
Did it take you and Pai a long time to fall in love?

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:24.240
For me, when I fall in love with someone,

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:35.880
it takes only an instant to know
they’re special.

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:45.240
And what matters is
what comes after, anyway.

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.040
Once you know you like them,

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.760
that’s when you decide if you want to
make a move or a move on.

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:59.480
You’re more mature than I thought,
you know?

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:05.360
You only ever see me through Pai’s eyes.

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.120
Of course I won’t come across as mature.

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:26.440
To wash away its bitterness,
cover bitter melon in salt

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:28.440
and refrigerate them for 20 minutes.

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.120
You can cook whatever dish you want
while waiting.

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:32.280
I see.

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:36.320
I’ll fry some appetizers
like nuggets and fries.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.240
North loves those.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:41.680
You shouldn’t let him eat
something so unnutritious.

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:46.800
But if he doesn’t enjoy nutritious food,

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:51.520
he’ll still eat the unhealthy food
when he’s alone anyway, Mr. Pai.

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:56.840
I’ll just…

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:08.520
What do you like about him?

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:11.280
Did you know who he is from the get-go
or did you find out later?

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:14.280
Oh…

00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:19.520
I only learned his family owns Empire
after I married him.

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.760
But if you’re asking me
when I fell for him…

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:24.360
When I got to talk to him, I guess.

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.120
Well, why?

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:29.920
Who wouldn’t like someone like North?

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.040
Answer me!

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.200
Right.

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:37.440
I like North because he’s kind.

00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:40.160
He doesn’t wish anyone harm.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:44.720
He’s the kind of person
you know can’t hurt a fly.

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.480
North is too naive.

00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:48.280
We’ve been trying to fix that about him.

00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:51.640
But I don’t think he needs fixing, Mr. Pai.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:55.080
He should be free
to live his life the way he wants.

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:57.160
Only from now on,
I’ll be watching his back.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:01.760
How would you do that?

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.080
Let’s say…

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:12.320
If North still believes in Santa Claus,
I’ll dress up as Santa every year.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.480
He doesn’t believe in that.

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:17.480
I was the one who told him
Santa Claus isn’t real.

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:19.840
Mr. Pai.

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:23.240
I believe there is
more than one way of growing up.

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:28.920
It’s possible for North to see the world
while keeping his optimistic outlook.

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:36.480
The world is a nice place because there
are people like North in it, don’t you think?

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.200
Let’s keep cooking.

00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:03.480
I have to apologize again that my mother
cannot come to dinner tonight.

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:05.480
It’s alright.

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:06.880
Try it.

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.040
Yes.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.760
It’s just as good as ever!

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.040
This is the first time
I’ve had anything like this.

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:24.800
The herbal soup recipe is
our ancestors’ secret.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:28.840
We’ve even received an expensive offer,
but we refused to sell it.

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.040
I see.

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.360
You know why?

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:37.000
Is there a prize if I get the answer right?

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:37.560
Watch it.

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.400
Sorry.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:46.120
Because we save the best things
for our family.

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.240
That’s our family motto for everything.

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:54.560
That’s why no one takes better care of us
than ourselves.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.640
Enough, Pai.

00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:59.600
Why are you scaring U away like that?

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:01.880
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:03.680
Pai.

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:06.680
Stop treating U like he’s planning to take me away to the North Pole.

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:11.320
Did you know what he said to me when we got here?

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:19.400
Can I ask you honestly?

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:23.120
Why do you always avoid him?

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.560
Because Pai is so strict.

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:28.240
Why is that?

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:28.960
U.

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.440
Are you teasing me?

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.560
Of course not.

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:37.800
But take a moment to think
why that is the case.

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:42.160
I promise I won’t say a word.

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:50.800
Because Pai is so strict.

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:55.040
Whatever I say or do seems to be wrong.

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.320
I once told him a joke,

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:59.600
and Pai turned it into a full-hour lecture.

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:02.200
I understand—

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:06.200
And all I do is make Pai’s life harder.

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:10.240
That’s why I want to stay away from him.

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:14.560
So that, whatever mistakes I make,
I have to deal with them myself.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.640
I don’t want to be a burden to anyone.

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:19.400
I think…

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.480
You’re taking it a little too far

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:24.800
since you don’t let him in on
what you’re doing with your life at all.

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:28.080
He’s been kept out of the loop on
how you’re dealing with your problems.

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:31.240
When he can’t estimate the situation,

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:33.240
he feels the need to take the matter into
his own hands and fix all your problems.

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:37.920
So if I talk to Pai more,
he’ll leave me more room to breathe?

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:41.120
I don’t know.

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:43.560
I just think it could be a good strategy.

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:45.720
You’ve been avoiding him
and it didn’t work, right?

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:47.480
Maybe it’s time to change things up?

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:49.400
We can even start today.

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.960
And one more thing,
U has been trying so hard to ensure

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.520
that this dinner is perfect.

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.440
He just wants to impress you, you know?

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.000
This fried fish,

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:06.520
we literally just learned
how to make it today.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:24.360
You don’t have to worry that
U will take me away from U, Pai.

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:28.600
What U is doing is the opposite, actually.

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:38.240
I… never said
I was ever worried about that.

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.400
That’s your assumption.

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:03.800
Thank you.

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.440
Not bad.

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:23.560
Thank you.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.880
That was hardly a compliment.

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:31.560
I’m actually happy the fish is even cooked.

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:32.560
What?

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.080
Of course it is fully cooked, U.

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:35.760
You practiced so much, you know?

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:37.400
You try it, too, Tim.

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:38.400
Of course.

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:41.520
Let me debone it for you guys.

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:43.640
Eat lots of fish, North.

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.840
Since we’re all together,

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:51.840
I’ve been curious about this.

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:55.160
How did you two meet?

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.080
Uhh…

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:01.880
How we met, huh?

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.920
Should I tell them
or do you want to, North?

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:05.640
I’d better do it,

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:10.280
because I don’t know how badly
you thought of me when we first met.

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:12.160
No way. Then let me tell them.

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:13.120
Let me tell them.

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:15.480
Here’s the thing…

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:55.080
U.

00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:00.920
Is everything actually really good
or am I just drunk?

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:03.840
It’s really good.

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:06.720
I didn’t have a sip
and even I am having a good time.

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:10.120
I can’t believe it.

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:16.200
I told you Pai would listen to us
if we talked to him nicely.

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:21.760
He just needed some time to accept that
his beloved little cousin is married, after all.

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:26.000
Are you really my husband?

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.520
You keep taking Pai’s side.

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:29.040
Are you friends with him now?

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:34.320
You seem happier when
you’re not fighting with Pai, you know?

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:42.240
Actually, Pai told me

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:45.920
what I feel for you isn’t love.

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:48.920
He said it’s just a whim.

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:54.640
And I couldn’t help but agree.

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:56.800
I was uncertain.

00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:59.360
I don’t know if it happened too fast.

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.120
I don’t know if this was love.

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:07.040
But today really made me realize that

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:09.200
I really do love you, U.

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:11.680
Oh.

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.560
What a relief!

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:15.640
Can you start off with an “I love you”

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.200
next time before you say the rest?

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:18.600
I was scared for a second!

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:21.600
U, stop it.

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:24.640
I can’t help it.

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:37.480
It was fun today.

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:38.480
Thank you.

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:39.680
Of course.

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:42.800
Thank you for such an amazing meal.

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:48.320
Let’s have lunch
at our family’s home sometime.

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:51.360
Wait!

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:55.240
Does that mean you accept U now, Pai?

00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:56.000
Yes!

00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:05.080
I’m just introducing him to the family,
not telling them you’re married.

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:10.480
Thank you, Pai.

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:11.600
Yeah.

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.400
Congratulations, U.

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:24.600
Congrats.

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:25.200
Alright.

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:26.880
Sorry about that.

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:29.480
Take it down a notch, you con.

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:35.160
See you.

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:52.440
Baby.

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.400
If I still believed in Santa Claus,

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:00.680
would you tell me the truth
or would you

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:03.200
dress up as Santa on Christmas?

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:10.000
I wouldn’t tell you the truth,

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.680
but I also wouldn’t dress up as Santa.

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:17.160
If you got sad that you didn’t get any
presents from Santa, I’d give you one.

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:18.480
You’d stop looking forward to Santa

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:20.080
and look forward to seeing me instead.

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:29.320
You and U somehow feel very similar.

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:34.000
How so?

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:40.320
You both fell first, and fell hard.

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:44.040
How does it feel to fall first, I wonder.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:49.080
How does it feel to fall first, huh?

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:54.520
Someone who falls first doesn’t want anyone to find out how cute his crush is.

00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:58.280
He can’t wait to win his crush over
as soon as possible.

00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:02.080
And once that happens, he wants to make
sure everything works out between them,

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:04.880
because he just knows in his heart
it can’t be anyone else for him.

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:06.640
You’re exaggerating.

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:08.160
I’m not.

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:09.720
I mean it.

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:12.200
I love you so much, you know?

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:14.120
I do.

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:16.240
This tells me everything.

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:17.440
I got it.

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:35.720
U looks at North the way you look at me.

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:45.360
Baby.

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:46.800
What’s that bag?

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:50.400
I almost forgot it.

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:57.200
I found this today and it reminded me
of you so I bought it for you.

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:04.240
A duckling?

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:07.600
He’s cute!

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:08.800
Let’s see.

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:10.920
He looks exactly like you.

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:12.400
He does not.

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:13.400
Take him back.

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:18.800
You’re totally hurting my feelings.

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:20.800
eally?

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:23.880
Alright.

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:25.200
I’ll agree he’s cute.

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:32.040
Let’s go home.

00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:44.400
We really did it.

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:50.280
There’s nothing to worry about
from here on out, right?

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:53.360
Pai is the hardest to impress.

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:57.480
If we don’t have to keep this
a secret anymore,

00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:00.000
do you want a wedding, North?

00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:04.480
I didn’t, at first.

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:11.880
But then I think you’d look really good as a groom and I can’t wait to have a big one!

00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:13.720
A big one?

00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:16.040
I want a funny wedding video.

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:17.760
My friend, Pure, can
make our wedding cake.

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:20.040
That will be good PR
for our bakery as well.

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:20.920
And the suits?

00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:22.400
I wear white and you wear black.

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:25.400
I’ll sing for you as a surprise that day.

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:26.840
No, don’t tell me!

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:29.400
It won’t be a surprise.

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:31.720
But you don’t know
which song I’ll sing, right?

00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:33.640
But I already know you’re going to!

00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:34.760
Well, guess I’m not signing, then.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.920
Wait, I’ve totally built up an expectation.

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:40.320
You’re serious about all this, aren’t you?

00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.480
It all sounds really fun, actually.

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.800
I guess we’ll have to wait for Pai to go through with his before we can go ahead.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:47.960
That’s a few months from now.

00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:50.000
Our wedding should be, like,
a week right after his!

00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:51.480
Oh, that soon?

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:52.680
That soon!

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:57.160
This is nice.

00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:01.840
It’s like I finally have a family today.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.320
Me, too.

00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:21.160
I love you, North.

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:32.200
I love you, too, U.

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:38.000
U!

00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:59.120
You seem stressed, baby.

00:49:59.120 --> 00:49:59.680
What?

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:01.960
You know you can be honest with me.

00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:02.880
I…

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:04.960
If we don’t get legally married,

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:07.440
it means my effort would be for nothing.

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:08.560
I know the truth now.

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:09.960
You need to divorce my cousin.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.200
No, I refuse.

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:13.000
I’ll stay here with North.

00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:17.680
You’re my whole world, Tim.

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:20.360
I can’t live without you.
