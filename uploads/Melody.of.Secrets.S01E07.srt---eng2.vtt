WEBVTT

00:00:00.665 --> 00:00:02.761
Which identity is my true self?

00:00:04.465 --> 00:00:04.973
Pleng!

00:00:08.245 --> 00:00:09.033
I know him.

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.949
(My name is Botpleng Thayadon.)

00:00:14.241 --> 00:00:16.002
(The only child of my parents.)

00:00:17.405 --> 00:00:18.390
How is it going, Tanu?

00:00:20.565 --> 00:00:21.433
Hello, Mrs. Kan.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:22.805
Hello, Mr. Petch.

00:00:28.665 --> 00:00:29.915
GRANDMA.

00:00:40.593 --> 00:00:42.315
He was in a deep hypnosis.

00:00:43.036 --> 00:00:44.702
But after the phone rang,
he got out of it.

00:00:45.515 --> 00:00:47.509
There must be something
about this ringtone.

00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:53.053
Okay, I’ll head back right away.

00:00:54.442 --> 00:00:55.204
The ringtone?

00:00:58.435 --> 00:00:59.475
What was the ringtone song?

00:01:00.305 --> 00:01:02.222
Probably Canon.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.007
Canon in D.

00:02:43.752 --> 00:02:45.430
Grandma set this ringtone for me.

00:02:48.487 --> 00:02:49.051
Why?

00:02:50.815 --> 00:02:51.804
I never asked.

00:02:52.585 --> 00:02:53.356
I thought

00:02:54.696 --> 00:02:55.604
she just did it.

00:02:57.335 --> 00:02:58.302
There’s something to it, right?

00:02:59.207 --> 00:03:01.706
You react to this melody.

00:03:02.665 --> 00:03:04.352
Which is from your dad’s old violin

00:03:05.425 --> 00:03:06.405
and also your ringtone.

00:03:07.128 --> 00:03:09.050
Maybe it’s the trigger of a hypnosis.

00:03:10.193 --> 00:03:11.285
Can you check on this?

00:03:13.827 --> 00:03:15.582
We’ll probably have to
check on everything.

00:03:16.845 --> 00:03:18.156
Just like how they’re checking on us.

00:03:24.324 --> 00:03:25.100
Is anything wrong?

00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:27.905
I think I saw a shadow
in front of your house

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.239
before your grandma called.

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:33.103
What did your grandma say?

00:03:34.342 --> 00:03:36.558
She just told me to hurry home.

00:03:41.832 --> 00:03:43.970
If someone’s watching,

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.602
this place might not be safe anymore.

00:03:48.302 --> 00:03:50.302
Let’s take this back to Bangkok.

00:03:50.887 --> 00:03:52.008
I also have a patient to attend to.

00:03:54.835 --> 00:03:55.380
But…

00:03:56.907 --> 00:03:58.356
Can I stay here for now?

00:03:59.635 --> 00:04:01.177
But we’re about to find out the truth.

00:04:01.764 --> 00:04:02.952
You saw that house,

00:04:03.506 --> 00:04:06.558
a new information you’ve never known
during the time you lost your memory.

00:04:07.436 --> 00:04:10.005
Not to mention that Canon in D song.

00:04:13.223 --> 00:04:13.739
Jen.

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:16.630
You can head back.

00:04:18.445 --> 00:04:19.356
I’ll stay with Pleng.

00:04:20.205 --> 00:04:21.134
Tan.

00:04:22.644 --> 00:04:24.201
Pleng is not just a suspect.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.656
He’s also my lover.

00:04:39.945 --> 00:04:42.813
Pleng’s family doesn’t want him
to remember

00:04:44.205 --> 00:04:45.576
because they don’t want him to get hurt.

00:04:47.675 --> 00:04:49.285
Hypnotizing him to remember

00:04:50.595 --> 00:04:54.836
is like forcing him
towards his most fragile memories.

00:04:57.055 --> 00:04:57.602
Jen.

00:04:58.685 --> 00:04:59.451
The truth

00:05:00.553 --> 00:05:03.684
is not so important that
we have to corner someone in.

00:05:04.876 --> 00:05:05.804
I’m sorry.

00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:33.205
Why were you gone for so long?

00:05:34.405 --> 00:05:34.952
Did I...

00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:37.475
make you and Doc Jen fight?

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.005
I was just grabbing my violin.

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:46.093
This is yours?

00:05:49.244 --> 00:05:50.352
Thun was very attached to me.

00:05:51.952 --> 00:05:53.553
He refused to study or do anything

00:05:54.455 --> 00:05:55.731
if I didn’t do it too.

00:05:57.626 --> 00:05:59.276
Sometimes being Thun’s brother

00:06:00.162 --> 00:06:03.505
brought me closer to
being this family’s son.

00:06:07.207 --> 00:06:09.001
I never enjoyed playing the violin.

00:06:12.448 --> 00:06:13.552
But I love it so much.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.839
Since it’s the only thing my dad loves.

00:06:18.685 --> 00:06:20.373
To the point that I don’t know now

00:06:22.787 --> 00:06:27.688
whether my dad’s violin still stands for
the love my family has for me.

00:06:30.374 --> 00:06:31.150
I’m afraid.

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:34.404
I’m afraid that if I know the truth,

00:06:36.602 --> 00:06:37.685
everything won’t be the same.

00:06:49.823 --> 00:06:51.407
I didn’t enjoy playing the violin either.

00:06:55.075 --> 00:06:56.174
Until I met you.

00:07:00.173 --> 00:07:01.284
That’s when I understand

00:07:02.885 --> 00:07:05.143
when a musician wants to play
the most beautiful melody

00:07:06.685 --> 00:07:07.900
for someone he loves

00:07:08.705 --> 00:07:09.502
and what it feels like.

00:07:16.375 --> 00:07:17.558
I want the sound of the violin

00:07:19.685 --> 00:07:21.150
to be the sound of love,
like it used to be.

00:07:23.255 --> 00:07:24.001
The love

00:07:25.005 --> 00:07:25.906
between you

00:07:27.425 --> 00:07:28.207
and I.

00:07:59.044 --> 00:08:01.272

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.130

on the seat

00:08:47.647 --> 00:08:52.106
of a bicycle built for two.

00:09:23.645 --> 00:09:25.207
The house I saw in my dreams

00:09:26.604 --> 00:09:27.507
used to be here.

00:09:28.395 --> 00:09:29.851
Even your memory

00:09:31.081 --> 00:09:32.306
can be erased.

00:09:33.476 --> 00:09:34.602
So does an entire house.

00:09:39.756 --> 00:09:41.110
The house can’t be brought back

00:09:41.899 --> 00:09:43.761
but my memory can.

00:09:44.891 --> 00:09:47.100
The one who wants to make me forget
made a mistake.

00:09:49.745 --> 00:09:52.205
For letting the housekeeper
send me the diary.

00:09:53.882 --> 00:09:54.534
That’s right.

00:09:55.399 --> 00:09:57.302
Or I wouldn’t be able
to reach you so easily.

00:09:58.928 --> 00:10:02.604
But why did he send that diary to you?

00:10:07.753 --> 00:10:09.137
Maybe because of Thunphob.

00:10:16.225 --> 00:10:16.702
Hey.

00:10:18.124 --> 00:10:19.602
Do you not believe in supernaturals?

00:10:24.775 --> 00:10:26.153
But I believe in the power of the mind.

00:10:27.405 --> 00:10:30.506
Thunphob’s mind that wanted us
to find the truth.

00:10:35.145 --> 00:10:36.457
It’s not the truth,

00:10:37.975 --> 00:10:39.257
what Thunphob sent me.

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:44.703
It’s you.

00:10:47.745 --> 00:10:49.401
Maybe you can hear
the melody of the leaves now.

00:10:50.965 --> 00:10:52.256
Since you’re this good at flirting.

00:10:54.645 --> 00:10:55.334
You have a point.

00:10:58.135 --> 00:11:00.307
I want to try listening
to the sound of the leaves again.

00:11:02.017 --> 00:11:04.884
I wonder if Botpleng’s memory returned,

00:11:07.195 --> 00:11:08.607
what melody would I hear from the leaves?

00:11:19.315 --> 00:11:20.250
Are you ready now?

00:11:21.379 --> 00:11:22.401
You can book Doc Jen.

00:11:23.825 --> 00:11:25.294
This time, I will turn off my phone

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:29.105
and won’t let anything
wake me up from the truth.

00:11:50.025 --> 00:11:50.657
Yes, Jen?

00:12:04.158 --> 00:12:04.703
Jen.

00:12:05.131 --> 00:12:05.854
How are you doing?

00:12:06.862 --> 00:12:07.815
Nothing big.

00:12:08.985 --> 00:12:10.416
I tried to run away
and jumped off the 2nd floor

00:12:10.445 --> 00:12:11.556
so I ended up like this.

00:12:12.851 --> 00:12:14.205
You got chased in a hospital?

00:12:19.373 --> 00:12:20.872
And you?

00:12:21.956 --> 00:12:22.956
Why are you with Doc Jen?

00:12:25.647 --> 00:12:27.315
Well, I…

00:12:27.534 --> 00:12:29.955
I reckon she’s alone, so I help out.

00:12:31.533 --> 00:12:33.306
So you and Tankhun can be at ease.

00:12:34.007 --> 00:12:34.507
Yeah.

00:12:37.125 --> 00:12:38.907
You guys are close enough
that you can call him over now?

00:12:41.225 --> 00:12:42.441
Well…

00:12:43.536 --> 00:12:44.608
I’m hitting on him.

00:12:45.653 --> 00:12:46.356
Alright?

00:12:47.272 --> 00:12:47.776
Jen!

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:49.808
Shouldn’t I call him over when I get hurt?

00:12:50.356 --> 00:12:53.204
Sympathy is a good chance for love.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:57.804
Okay.

00:12:58.219 --> 00:12:59.208
I see what it is now.

00:13:00.215 --> 00:13:01.109
I won’t ask you anything anymore.

00:13:02.725 --> 00:13:04.204
Good.

00:13:04.995 --> 00:13:06.204
Can we get to the point now?

00:13:07.645 --> 00:13:09.076
Tanu is already arrested.

00:13:10.107 --> 00:13:11.642
Why is this happening to Jen?

00:13:28.182 --> 00:13:32.207
Jennaree tries to recover Botpleng’s memory
that has been locked away.

00:13:33.685 --> 00:13:35.488
Botpleng’s memory
that has been locked away

00:13:35.505 --> 00:13:36.983
might have something to do
with the corruption.

00:13:39.177 --> 00:13:40.707
Botpleng was made to forget

00:13:42.119 --> 00:13:44.805
while the others involved were killed.

00:13:47.825 --> 00:13:51.407
SUSPECT.

00:13:51.746 --> 00:13:52.755
Why do I feel like

00:13:54.472 --> 00:13:56.359
there are missing puzzles.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:00.601
Are the puzzles missing

00:14:01.375 --> 00:14:02.804
or do you refuse to piece them together?

00:14:04.235 --> 00:14:06.307
Right now, what you’re supposed to do is

00:14:06.318 --> 00:14:08.903
find evidence
to arrest Botpleng’s family.

00:14:09.722 --> 00:14:11.604
Or would you like to wait
until Jennaree is gone, too?

00:14:14.305 --> 00:14:15.353
It’s time

00:14:16.488 --> 00:14:18.207
that you look for the culprit

00:14:18.875 --> 00:14:19.807
not a lover.

00:14:24.955 --> 00:14:26.170
I’ve talked to the governor.

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.002
There’s a recording too.

00:14:28.347 --> 00:14:29.451
In case you want to listen to it yourself.

00:14:33.793 --> 00:14:34.888
I became a journalist

00:14:36.025 --> 00:14:37.358
to set my dad’s record straight.

00:14:38.051 --> 00:14:39.401
But from the cases that happened,

00:14:39.859 --> 00:14:41.715
I’m so close to believing that
my dad’s guilty.

00:14:43.081 --> 00:14:45.159
But suddenly, you’re saying that
my dad’s not guilty?

00:14:45.776 --> 00:14:47.303
Hey, I’m not saying that.

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:51.405
Actually, I didn’t even think about that.

00:14:52.608 --> 00:14:54.204
I’m just helping you investigate

00:14:54.985 --> 00:14:56.703
in case we can find the real culprit.

00:14:58.072 --> 00:15:01.001
Whether it’s your mom, your grandma,

00:15:01.725 --> 00:15:03.010
or others who are involved.

00:15:04.875 --> 00:15:06.756
But after listening
to the governor’s words,

00:15:08.663 --> 00:15:09.605
I’m at a dead end.

00:15:18.233 --> 00:15:19.208
(What did you find out?)

00:15:19.825 --> 00:15:21.170
(If you’re putting it like that)

00:15:21.885 --> 00:15:23.705
(it must mean there’s something
I could find out)

00:15:24.585 --> 00:15:27.306
But you’re just unsure
if I know it, right?

00:15:27.522 --> 00:15:32.303
Being a journalist doesn’t mean
you can threaten or cross anyone.

00:15:32.525 --> 00:15:35.435
I’m sorry if you misunderstood
my intention.

00:15:36.528 --> 00:15:38.608
I heard that 15 years ago,

00:15:38.989 --> 00:15:43.638
you and Sheriff Petchkla
were the pioneers of wind power

00:15:43.659 --> 00:15:44.906
in the lower north-eastern region

00:15:46.669 --> 00:15:49.906
before you guys were
investigated for fraud.

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:54.509
Then everything ended
because Sheriff Petchkla died.

00:15:55.045 --> 00:15:55.657
You know what?

00:15:56.559 --> 00:15:59.035
The saddest part for me
was not Petchkla’s death

00:16:00.185 --> 00:16:02.703
but the fact that he died
before the result came through.

00:16:03.345 --> 00:16:04.887
(He conducted his duty honestly.)

00:16:05.863 --> 00:16:08.305
(He never cheated on anyone.)

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:10.885
(Let alone cheating on the country.)

00:16:18.145 --> 00:16:18.709
Then…

00:16:21.047 --> 00:16:22.607
If my dad’s never cheated on anyone,

00:16:23.916 --> 00:16:26.073
all our hypothesis is down the drain.

00:16:29.776 --> 00:16:32.808
That means digging up my dad’s case
was not what triggered the murderer.

00:16:33.706 --> 00:16:35.604
Then why did they kill
my parents’ subordinates?

00:16:39.562 --> 00:16:40.709
What if they killed

00:16:43.327 --> 00:16:44.807
because something else was the trigger?

00:16:48.425 --> 00:16:49.134
Such as you.

00:16:50.919 --> 00:16:53.802
Someone died at that house
since the first day you stepped into it.

00:16:55.415 --> 00:16:57.605
The only one who tries
to ward you off that house

00:16:58.099 --> 00:16:59.109
is our grandmother.

00:17:00.872 --> 00:17:02.030
Isn’t that suspicious?

00:17:05.808 --> 00:17:06.706
You’re trying to say that

00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:09.322
my grandma is behind all this

00:17:10.173 --> 00:17:11.808
including framing my dad?

00:17:12.992 --> 00:17:13.510
Yeah.

00:17:14.149 --> 00:17:17.907
Didn’t you say it yourself that
your grandma doesn’t love you

00:17:18.115 --> 00:17:19.109
and doesn’t like your dad.

00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:21.350
Isn’t it suspicious?

00:17:26.454 --> 00:17:27.936
I will feed the fish, too.

00:17:33.186 --> 00:17:33.684
Grandma.

00:17:34.515 --> 00:17:35.836
Would you like to make merit
for Dad with us?

00:17:37.185 --> 00:17:38.448
It’ll probably have an adverse effect.

00:17:39.405 --> 00:17:41.964
If you were to make merit,
it should be done with full intention.

00:17:43.945 --> 00:17:46.636
And if I want to do it,
I can be at it on my own.

00:17:47.019 --> 00:17:48.306
I don’t need your invitation.

00:17:55.546 --> 00:17:57.602
Grandma is not so fond of Dad.

00:17:58.436 --> 00:18:01.205
She thinks that your dad stole
her daughter and made me struggle.

00:18:02.426 --> 00:18:03.300
But that’s not true.

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:06.506
When I’m with your dad and have you,

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:08.137
I’m so happy.

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:12.307
It’s okay if you and I
are the only ones who like Dad.

00:18:12.817 --> 00:18:14.405
If Grandma doesn’t, then just let her be.

00:18:16.574 --> 00:18:17.214
This is it.

00:18:18.125 --> 00:18:20.902
A chance for you to prove
your dad’s innocence.

00:18:26.335 --> 00:18:28.105
Narrowing down the culprit
from anyone in your family

00:18:29.079 --> 00:18:30.084
to just your grandma?

00:18:31.327 --> 00:18:32.106
What do you think?

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:35.156
I don’t know.

00:18:36.385 --> 00:18:38.204
At this point, I don’t want
to believe anything anymore.

00:18:48.145 --> 00:18:48.601
Hey!

00:18:49.042 --> 00:18:49.709
Tankhun!

00:19:02.478 --> 00:19:03.309
He’s probably hungry.

00:19:10.416 --> 00:19:11.204
Are you okay?

00:19:12.835 --> 00:19:13.709
I’m okay.

00:19:13.965 --> 00:19:14.709
I should ask you.

00:19:15.122 --> 00:19:15.787
Are you okay?

00:19:16.601 --> 00:19:18.091
I learned martial arts.

00:19:18.493 --> 00:19:19.608
This won’t–

00:19:20.985 --> 00:19:21.977
Ouch! Ouch!

00:19:24.481 --> 00:19:25.355
And you’re saying you’re okay?

00:19:25.442 --> 00:19:25.967
Ow!

00:19:25.993 --> 00:19:27.445
Why did you touch it? It hurts!

00:19:28.995 --> 00:19:30.256
Right there. That’s it.

00:19:36.635 --> 00:19:37.825
But you said you’re okay.

00:19:38.377 --> 00:19:40.885
Hey, this is accidental and age-incited.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:41.805
Can’t help it.

00:19:45.614 --> 00:19:46.187
Thank you.

00:19:55.793 --> 00:19:56.968
So what are you going to do?

00:20:00.143 --> 00:20:01.207
Well… you’ll have to…

00:20:03.887 --> 00:20:04.807
Take care of me

00:20:05.335 --> 00:20:06.084
at my apartment.

00:20:08.845 --> 00:20:09.407
Why?

00:20:10.241 --> 00:20:11.152
Do you not want to go?

00:20:11.823 --> 00:20:12.408
No.

00:20:16.774 --> 00:20:17.907
But I meant to say

00:20:18.625 --> 00:20:20.171
I think your apartment is a bit too empty.

00:20:22.565 --> 00:20:24.305
I’ve never thought of
that place as my home.

00:20:25.282 --> 00:20:27.676
I was staying there just
to investigate Thunphob’s case.

00:20:31.432 --> 00:20:32.753
But I want to make it a home.

00:20:36.881 --> 00:20:37.813
Just having you there,

00:20:38.679 --> 00:20:39.685
that’s when it becomes a home.

00:20:43.035 --> 00:20:43.611
Good.

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:45.269
Then just give them to me.

00:20:45.512 --> 00:20:47.731
Both the one in Khao Yai
and your apartment too.

00:20:47.761 --> 00:20:48.389
Okay?

00:20:49.084 --> 00:20:49.636
Okay.

00:20:50.325 --> 00:20:51.690
And I’ll give you one more thing.

00:20:53.666 --> 00:20:54.201
What is it?

00:20:55.965 --> 00:20:56.900
Last name.

00:20:58.641 --> 00:20:59.263
Tan!

00:21:01.776 --> 00:21:02.771
People will see us!

00:21:03.573 --> 00:21:04.313
There’s no one.

00:21:04.509 --> 00:21:05.192
Put it on properly.

00:21:07.005 --> 00:21:07.768
-Just a bit?
-Hmm!

00:21:13.589 --> 00:21:14.478
I’m bored.

00:21:15.679 --> 00:21:16.807
Are you going to finish it today?

00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:18.084
There’s no rush.

00:21:24.131 --> 00:21:24.804
I don’t know.

00:21:26.728 --> 00:21:28.001
I think we need to hurry.

00:21:39.447 --> 00:21:41.507
Whether my memory returns or not,

00:21:43.423 --> 00:21:45.684
I will find the last piece of the puzzle.

00:21:49.447 --> 00:21:51.205
We will investigate, along with hypnosis.

00:21:52.205 --> 00:21:55.568
I won’t let anyone be the next victim.

00:22:04.225 --> 00:22:05.955
GRANDMA.

00:22:10.005 --> 00:22:10.651
What?!

00:22:14.543 --> 00:22:15.105
Mom!

00:22:34.355 --> 00:22:34.884
Yes?

00:22:38.749 --> 00:22:40.107
Why can’t Mom speak, Grandma?

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:43.666
Her muscles haven’t recovered.

00:22:43.896 --> 00:22:44.906
It will take some time.

00:22:48.742 --> 00:22:49.706
It’s alright, Mom.

00:22:51.555 --> 00:22:52.879
Just having you wake up to me,

00:22:53.739 --> 00:22:54.955
it already makes me so happy.

00:22:57.393 --> 00:22:58.700
I’ll take care of you, Mom.

00:23:01.015 --> 00:23:03.469
I’ll see if you can do what you say.

00:23:04.205 --> 00:23:07.905
Not just running around for people
who would destroy this family and your mom.

00:23:15.365 --> 00:23:16.604
Don’t be afraid, Mom.

00:23:19.657 --> 00:23:20.804
I will protect you.

00:23:35.857 --> 00:23:37.785
Why did you let Botpleng go home?

00:23:39.113 --> 00:23:39.906
You know full well

00:23:40.441 --> 00:23:42.571
that the most suspicious person
is Pleng’s Grandma.

00:23:43.095 --> 00:23:43.657
That’s right.

00:23:44.945 --> 00:23:47.530
But Pleng insisted
that he has to protect his mother.

00:23:48.716 --> 00:23:49.401
Why?

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:51.808
Aren’t you afraid that Pleng
would be in danger?

00:23:52.315 --> 00:23:53.604
If Madame were to hurt Pleng,

00:23:55.367 --> 00:23:56.401
she would have done it long ago.

00:23:58.835 --> 00:24:01.924
When I say ‘in danger’,
I’m not talking about Pleng’s life.

00:24:02.986 --> 00:24:04.801
I’m talking about his memory.

00:24:05.687 --> 00:24:08.008
If they can make Pleng forget everything,

00:24:11.335 --> 00:24:12.158
it’s over.

00:25:29.745 --> 00:25:32.100
(I sent you something.
Look forward to it.)

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:41.706
What did you get me?

00:25:50.785 --> 00:25:51.681
I got myself delivered.

00:25:54.844 --> 00:25:55.507
What do you think?

00:25:55.807 --> 00:25:56.482
Do you like it?

00:26:01.896 --> 00:26:02.805
What are you doing?

00:26:03.025 --> 00:26:03.862
Someone will notice you.

00:26:04.395 --> 00:26:05.008
Come over here.

00:26:15.295 --> 00:26:16.337
It’s really risky, you know?

00:26:17.235 --> 00:26:19.216
What would I do
if you got hurt like Doc Jen?

00:26:19.725 --> 00:26:20.558
You don’t have to do anything.

00:26:21.023 --> 00:26:21.955
I’ll run away in time anyway.

00:26:30.125 --> 00:26:31.201
Do you think I’m being reckless?

00:26:36.854 --> 00:26:39.005
You haven’t read my mind for a while now
that you’re so eager to do it?

00:26:39.515 --> 00:26:40.672
I’m not here to read your mind.

00:26:42.608 --> 00:26:43.475
I’m here because I want to see you.

00:27:13.829 --> 00:27:15.303
I’m so close to knowing the truth.

00:27:17.804 --> 00:27:18.509
Not too long

00:27:19.765 --> 00:27:21.608
and I’ll be there for you
to read my mind every day.

00:27:33.875 --> 00:27:34.759
I’m worried about you.

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:38.205
Don’t worry.

00:27:40.182 --> 00:27:41.107
This is my house.

00:27:42.267 --> 00:27:43.265
I can get away.

00:27:48.598 --> 00:27:49.106
Oh.

00:27:49.465 --> 00:27:50.115
By the way.

00:27:51.577 --> 00:27:53.102
I think I found something odd.

00:27:53.585 --> 00:27:54.305
Have a look.

00:27:55.413 --> 00:27:55.985
Here.

00:27:56.955 --> 00:27:57.506
What’s this?

00:28:00.558 --> 00:28:01.276
See?

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:04.405
There’s no picture of Grandma.

00:28:06.158 --> 00:28:06.836
I think

00:28:07.585 --> 00:28:08.977
I have to look for more evidences

00:28:09.915 --> 00:28:11.365
while waiting for Mom to get better.

00:28:22.525 --> 00:28:23.752
You won’t forget me again, right?

00:28:27.125 --> 00:28:27.706
Never.

00:28:45.862 --> 00:28:47.133
While you were asleep,

00:28:48.705 --> 00:28:50.900
I have so many things
I wanted to tell you.

00:28:52.001 --> 00:28:52.888
But this one

00:28:54.035 --> 00:28:55.555
is what you’d probably
want to know the most.

00:28:57.968 --> 00:28:59.303
I have a lover now, Mom.

00:29:02.927 --> 00:29:03.947
His name is Tankhun.

00:29:05.665 --> 00:29:06.905
He’s Thunphob’s older brother.

00:29:15.345 --> 00:29:16.552
Do you know Thunphob, Mom?

00:29:19.605 --> 00:29:21.407
You might know him as Tankhun

00:29:22.121 --> 00:29:23.703
but he’s actually Thunphob.

00:29:24.958 --> 00:29:26.552
He used Tankhun’s name
when he got to know me.

00:29:29.038 --> 00:29:29.561
Tan…

00:29:31.939 --> 00:29:32.442
Khun…

00:29:32.494 --> 00:29:33.005
Mom!

00:29:34.891 --> 00:29:35.404
Thun–

00:29:36.556 --> 00:29:37.059
Thun–

00:29:37.745 --> 00:29:39.902
Thunphob…

00:29:42.115 --> 00:29:42.555
Mom!

00:29:44.225 --> 00:29:45.595
Die!

00:29:45.644 --> 00:29:46.134
Mom!

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:48.060
-Die!
-Mom!

00:29:48.682 --> 00:29:49.156
Mom!

00:29:49.282 --> 00:29:49.927
Mom!

00:29:50.813 --> 00:29:51.253
Mom!

00:29:51.715 --> 00:29:53.050
-Die!
-I’m here, Mom.

00:29:54.017 --> 00:29:54.785
Die!

00:29:54.805 --> 00:29:55.187
Mom!

00:29:55.386 --> 00:29:56.171
What are you doing?

00:29:56.573 --> 00:29:58.103
What have you done to your mom?

00:29:58.510 --> 00:29:59.008
Huh?

00:29:59.679 --> 00:30:01.509
I just told her about Tankhun.

00:30:03.573 --> 00:30:04.196
That’s enough.

00:30:04.265 --> 00:30:05.041
Be on your way!

00:30:05.921 --> 00:30:06.715
Kan! Kan! Kan!

00:30:07.014 --> 00:30:07.399
Kan!

00:30:07.967 --> 00:30:08.476
Thun…

00:30:09.808 --> 00:30:10.216
Mom!

00:30:15.976 --> 00:30:16.358
Mom.

00:30:16.502 --> 00:30:18.657
Go! I’ll take care of my daughter.

00:30:18.945 --> 00:30:19.423
Go!

00:30:20.185 --> 00:30:20.805
Go!

00:30:22.503 --> 00:30:22.955
Go!

00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:38.256
(I think my mom)

00:30:38.776 --> 00:30:40.302
(knows what happened to Thunphob.)

00:30:54.865 --> 00:30:56.303
Botpleng Thayadon.

00:30:57.615 --> 00:30:59.035
Where are you right now?

00:31:00.545 --> 00:31:02.152
I’m at an old wooden house.

00:31:03.139 --> 00:31:03.801
No.

00:31:05.199 --> 00:31:07.026
Right now, you’re 18.

00:31:08.647 --> 00:31:10.405
You were in a long sleep.

00:31:11.681 --> 00:31:13.807
Then you wake up to see your mom.

00:31:15.958 --> 00:31:17.204
What do you see?

00:31:18.747 --> 00:31:19.278
Mom.

00:31:20.759 --> 00:31:22.456
She asks me how I’m doing.

00:31:23.626 --> 00:31:24.475
Good.

00:31:47.315 --> 00:31:47.956
Hello?

00:31:49.735 --> 00:31:51.032
(I’m having a meal.)

00:31:51.706 --> 00:31:52.654
(Do you have anything to say?)

00:31:53.971 --> 00:31:56.305
If not, I’ll hang up.

00:31:57.095 --> 00:31:58.257
I have to take care of my mom.

00:32:02.639 --> 00:32:03.909
Pleng got hypnotized by that family.

00:32:35.453 --> 00:32:37.605
Someone harmed the person
who tried to take Botpleng

00:32:37.696 --> 00:32:39.902
away from his mom and grandma.

00:32:41.857 --> 00:32:42.632
Do you know who?

00:32:44.702 --> 00:32:45.331
Here.

00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:48.804
Someone who used to work
for Kedsara’s husband.

00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:51.503
Now you know

00:32:52.635 --> 00:32:55.706
that the mastermind behind all this
is the Thayadon family.

00:33:00.795 --> 00:33:02.356
I have nothing to do
with the Thayadon family.

00:33:06.192 --> 00:33:08.408
But you do for Thunphob’s death, right?

00:33:19.895 --> 00:33:20.857
This is yours, right?

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:36.007
I have another good news for you.

00:33:37.627 --> 00:33:40.107
Khitakan, your old boss, is conscious now.

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:44.607
If she knows that you’re arrested,

00:33:46.626 --> 00:33:49.103
how can she be sure
that you won’t spill anything?

00:33:51.475 --> 00:33:52.432
She might

00:33:54.275 --> 00:33:55.958
knock you out entirely.

00:34:03.436 --> 00:34:04.105
Tanu.

00:34:06.084 --> 00:34:08.856
Right now, your time is counting down.

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:12.709
Stop protecting others.

00:34:13.819 --> 00:34:17.102
Your life is in your hands.

00:34:20.067 --> 00:34:24.085
Pick a smarter choice and let
the Thayadon face their karma.

00:34:29.073 --> 00:34:30.002
I’ll come clean.

00:34:40.076 --> 00:34:41.605
You have to thank me for many more things.

00:34:42.427 --> 00:34:45.607
Because I’ll do so much more for you.

00:34:45.885 --> 00:34:46.487
You’re boasting.

00:34:46.888 --> 00:34:47.651
I’m not!

00:34:47.952 --> 00:34:48.863
I’m being serious.

00:34:51.097 --> 00:34:53.102
It’s like we’re taking turns
being stuck in bed.

00:34:56.427 --> 00:34:57.254
Have a bite.

00:34:58.207 --> 00:34:59.552
It’s your favorite.

00:35:03.321 --> 00:35:04.804
I’m not sure if it’s good.

00:35:05.802 --> 00:35:07.287
But if you want to have a delicious one

00:35:07.805 --> 00:35:09.807
then you should quickly recover
and make one yourself.

00:35:18.965 --> 00:35:19.903
It’s really good.

00:35:20.825 --> 00:35:22.506
Someone’s tasting it for you, right?

00:35:23.404 --> 00:35:24.085
No.

00:35:25.355 --> 00:35:26.356
I only have you, Mom.

00:35:38.487 --> 00:35:42.087
Bless you.

00:35:48.559 --> 00:35:49.204
How are you doing?

00:35:49.927 --> 00:35:51.204
Feeling more at ease now?

00:35:52.447 --> 00:35:54.604
Ever since Pleng became
the same Pleng,

00:35:55.356 --> 00:35:56.703
I’m no longer worried.

00:35:58.029 --> 00:35:59.703
Thank you so much, Mom.

00:36:00.245 --> 00:36:01.641
I’m always a trouble for you.

00:36:03.293 --> 00:36:04.205
It’s alright.

00:36:07.019 --> 00:36:08.605
I hope you can really stop worrying.

00:36:09.254 --> 00:36:11.008
He keeps bringing trouble

00:36:11.549 --> 00:36:13.106
while his mom is sick.

00:36:16.353 --> 00:36:19.507
I think everything’s about to get better.

00:36:22.325 --> 00:36:25.534
5 years that I’ve been sick,
it felt like being dead, though I’m alive.

00:36:27.465 --> 00:36:28.705
Heaven must have seen

00:36:29.137 --> 00:36:32.303
that I’ve already repaid
all the sins I did to Thunphob.

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:46.045
This is a special bugging device.

00:36:46.654 --> 00:36:47.902
Inspector Dao gave it to me.

00:36:48.585 --> 00:36:49.777
Definitely better than the one you have.

00:36:51.885 --> 00:36:52.503
Thank you.

00:36:58.174 --> 00:36:58.891
I think

00:37:00.302 --> 00:37:01.706
Grandma will probably hypnotize me

00:37:02.235 --> 00:37:03.681
so that I’ll only remember things about me

00:37:04.407 --> 00:37:05.906
and forget about you and the murder cases.

00:37:06.756 --> 00:37:07.604
I also think that

00:37:08.773 --> 00:37:11.103
she probably does this to my mom, too.

00:37:14.025 --> 00:37:14.604
Yeah.

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:19.909
Hey.

00:37:21.035 --> 00:37:22.107
Aren’t you worried about me anymore?

00:37:23.641 --> 00:37:24.625
I told you

00:37:25.267 --> 00:37:26.307
it’s not dangerous.

00:37:29.005 --> 00:37:29.706
You’re right.

00:37:30.964 --> 00:37:32.106
It even surprises me

00:37:33.225 --> 00:37:35.250
how your grandma could do all this alone.

00:37:35.959 --> 00:37:36.801
Just a little more

00:37:38.026 --> 00:37:39.503
and we’ll get to know the truth.

00:37:48.335 --> 00:37:49.054
Just a little more

00:37:51.125 --> 00:37:52.333
and we’ll get to be together.

00:37:59.113 --> 00:38:00.309
(Heaven must have seen)

00:38:00.785 --> 00:38:04.004
(that I’ve already repaid all the sins
I did to Thunphob.)

00:38:22.925 --> 00:38:24.307
(Tankhun, I’m sorry.)

00:38:25.075 --> 00:38:26.805
(My mom’s the one who killed Thunphob.)

00:38:32.626 --> 00:38:33.687
Thank you, Mom.

00:38:35.537 --> 00:38:36.659
Well, here.

00:38:37.482 --> 00:38:38.482
No, you should do it yourself.

00:38:39.385 --> 00:38:41.339
Look, he’s all grown up now.

00:38:41.817 --> 00:38:43.405
You don’t have to be so accommodating.

00:38:44.945 --> 00:38:48.115
I want to make up for lost time
that I wasn’t there for him.

00:38:48.651 --> 00:38:49.186
Hmm.

00:38:53.851 --> 00:38:54.402
Pleng!

00:39:01.296 --> 00:39:01.968
Pleng, son.

00:39:02.873 --> 00:39:03.456
Pleng!

00:39:05.115 --> 00:39:05.587
It’s late.

00:39:05.893 --> 00:39:06.764
Where are you going?

00:39:12.208 --> 00:39:13.208
I’m getting out of here.

00:39:14.186 --> 00:39:14.802
Why?

00:39:22.699 --> 00:39:24.205
You and Mom can’t fool me anymore.

00:39:35.253 --> 00:39:36.084
My mom has come back to her senses now.

00:39:36.155 --> 00:39:37.401
-I have to go.
-Wait.

00:39:40.065 --> 00:39:41.635
The strings on your dad’s violin
have been changed.

00:39:41.909 --> 00:39:43.404
That’s why it doesn’t sound like
any other violins.

00:39:44.355 --> 00:39:46.057
Your ringtone is also Canon in D

00:39:46.632 --> 00:39:47.771
which is recorded from that violin.

00:39:48.599 --> 00:39:50.075
It’s the trigger of a hypnosis.

00:39:54.519 --> 00:39:55.051
Then…

00:39:56.959 --> 00:39:58.657
There must be a way to counter it, right?

00:40:00.805 --> 00:40:03.306
(You can play a podcast or any sound)

00:40:03.625 --> 00:40:05.035
(just so that there’s another
disrupting sound.)

00:40:05.127 --> 00:40:07.158
(Or you can recite
the multiplication table )

00:40:07.499 --> 00:40:10.199
(so that there are multiple sound waves
working unconstantly.)

00:40:14.451 --> 00:40:15.454
I knew it.

00:40:16.299 --> 00:40:17.897
You’re all about ruining this family!

00:40:18.079 --> 00:40:19.473
The ones who destroy this family–

00:40:19.536 --> 00:40:20.207
That’s you!

00:40:20.662 --> 00:40:21.684
It’s you and Mom!

00:40:21.795 --> 00:40:22.405
That’s not true!

00:40:24.215 --> 00:40:26.336
And you guys didn’t just
destroy our family.

00:40:26.985 --> 00:40:28.851
You also destroy the other’s family, too!

00:40:29.085 --> 00:40:29.706
That’s not true!

00:40:30.187 --> 00:40:31.112
That’s not true, honey.

00:40:31.125 --> 00:40:32.016
That’s not true.

00:40:32.382 --> 00:40:32.853
That’s not true.

00:40:32.983 --> 00:40:33.496
Pleng.

00:40:35.143 --> 00:40:36.088
That’s not it, son.

00:40:36.521 --> 00:40:37.001
Pleng.

00:40:37.779 --> 00:40:38.665
That’s not it.

00:40:39.675 --> 00:40:40.650
I love you.

00:40:41.294 --> 00:40:42.425
That’s not what it is, Pleng.

00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:54.500
But I hate

00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:00.088
I hate murderers like you guys.

00:41:03.466 --> 00:41:04.710
I hate this family.

00:41:05.703 --> 00:41:06.847
That’s not what it is, Pleng.

00:41:07.426 --> 00:41:08.073
Pleng!

00:41:08.565 --> 00:41:09.310
Pleng!

00:41:09.728 --> 00:41:10.639
Pleng!

00:41:15.079 --> 00:41:15.875
Pleng!

00:43:40.585 --> 00:43:42.082
Please don’t cry alone again, Pleng.

00:43:43.215 --> 00:43:44.376
There’s only your heart

00:43:45.473 --> 00:43:47.004
that makes me feel safe.

00:43:47.463 --> 00:43:48.734
I want to make it our home.

00:43:49.534 --> 00:43:50.085
Got you!

00:43:51.810 --> 00:43:53.004
Keep one with you at all times.

00:43:53.303 --> 00:43:54.402
You should keep one as well

00:43:55.016 --> 00:43:56.202
so that I can find you too.

00:43:56.325 --> 00:43:58.709
You don’t know that
I started buying things in pairs

00:43:59.182 --> 00:44:00.365
since the first time I met you.
