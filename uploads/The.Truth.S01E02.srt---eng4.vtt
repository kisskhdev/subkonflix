00:01:06.336 --> 00:01:10.778
=The Truth=

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.136
=Episode 2=

00:01:18.552 --> 00:01:19.472
You're all here.

00:01:20.832 --> 00:01:21.432
Zhao.

00:01:22.712 --> 00:01:24.033
You all look so beautiful today.

00:01:24.033 --> 00:01:24.753
You too.

00:01:24.753 --> 00:01:25.432
Exactly.

00:01:25.432 --> 00:01:26.593
You flatter me.

00:01:26.593 --> 00:01:27.712
Not at all.

00:01:27.912 --> 00:01:29.673
You look incredibly cool in this outfit.

00:01:29.673 --> 00:01:30.912
- That chain suits you.
- Little Zhao.

00:01:30.912 --> 00:01:31.960
(Han Zhao, Ye Qian's childhood friend)
Look, Ye Qian's here.

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:34.313
Little Qian.

00:01:34.313 --> 00:01:35.313
Don't call me that.

00:01:36.113 --> 00:01:37.912
I've called you that since childhood.

00:01:37.912 --> 00:01:38.873
What should I call you?

00:01:39.472 --> 00:01:40.313
Baby Qian?

00:01:42.584 --> 00:01:43.432
Nice bike.

00:01:43.432 --> 00:01:44.920
Didn't you say you weren't coming?

00:01:45.393 --> 00:01:46.233
I changed my mind.

00:01:47.873 --> 00:01:48.873
Not coming, huh?

00:01:50.593 --> 00:01:51.472
No one's coming?

00:01:51.673 --> 00:01:52.472
Alright.

00:01:52.472 --> 00:01:53.352
No one's coming?

00:01:53.472 --> 00:01:54.953
You're having a blast, Liu.

00:01:55.873 --> 00:01:56.632
Qing.

00:01:57.313 --> 00:01:58.552
Got held up by something.

00:01:58.552 --> 00:01:59.513
Sorry, I'm late.

00:01:59.513 --> 00:02:01.192
Liu, have a seat.

00:02:01.432 --> 00:02:02.233
Let's continue.

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:04.912
Really sorry about that.

00:02:43.793 --> 00:02:45.393
Is your racing legal here?

00:02:45.393 --> 00:02:47.393
All paperwork's in order.
Completely legal.

00:02:47.832 --> 00:02:49.633
The police deal with illegality.

00:03:07.073 --> 00:03:09.152
Well, after these three laps,

00:03:09.152 --> 00:03:10.992
Little Qian will be at least fourth.

00:03:12.513 --> 00:03:13.312
Don't believe me?

00:03:16.592 --> 00:03:17.393
Let's bet.

00:03:18.473 --> 00:03:20.992
Officers don't gamble.

00:03:22.673 --> 00:03:23.513
How boring.

00:03:23.712 --> 00:03:25.793
Just verbally, I know you're broke.

00:03:28.592 --> 00:03:29.393
Okay, let's bet.

00:03:29.673 --> 00:03:30.992
Qing, Liu.

00:03:31.832 --> 00:03:32.752
This one's on me.

00:03:50.592 --> 00:03:53.032
We'll fully compensate
for all damages here.

00:03:55.113 --> 00:03:56.992
I also apologize to you all
on Liu's behalf.

00:04:00.752 --> 00:04:01.793
However,

00:04:03.913 --> 00:04:05.113
keeping us waiting this long?

00:04:06.393 --> 00:04:07.913
Even for a first-time cooperation

00:04:08.393 --> 00:04:09.513
with mutual distrust,

00:04:10.113 --> 00:04:12.832
it's still too disrespectful.

00:04:15.312 --> 00:04:16.233
In business,

00:04:16.992 --> 00:04:18.113
rules matter most.

00:04:19.233 --> 00:04:22.033
Better to lose the deal than lose trust.

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:26.432
Perhaps this trip

00:04:27.432 --> 00:04:28.593
was a mistake for us.

00:04:29.512 --> 00:04:30.312
Let's go, Liu.

00:04:31.233 --> 00:04:32.392
Qing, wait.

00:04:33.512 --> 00:04:37.312
We're very sincere
about this cooperation.

00:04:41.312 --> 00:04:42.113
Excuse me.

00:04:42.312 --> 00:04:43.113
Need to take this.

00:05:03.552 --> 00:05:04.713
Overtaking on a bend?

00:05:05.512 --> 00:05:06.392
It's too dangerous.

00:05:07.512 --> 00:05:09.473
You don't know Little Qian at all.

00:05:26.872 --> 00:05:27.673
Cool!

00:05:27.673 --> 00:05:28.552
Awesome!

00:05:31.392 --> 00:05:33.312
You two grew up together.

00:05:33.593 --> 00:05:34.913
You must know him well.

00:05:34.913 --> 00:05:35.992
Since you know him so well,

00:05:35.992 --> 00:05:37.833
why haven't you won him over yet?

00:05:40.593 --> 00:05:41.632
He told you that?

00:05:42.233 --> 00:05:43.593
Isn't it obvious?

00:05:44.913 --> 00:05:46.593
Ever since he moved into our dorm,

00:05:46.593 --> 00:05:47.793
you've visited so many times.

00:05:47.952 --> 00:05:49.793
Even the security guard
at the gate knows you.

00:05:50.233 --> 00:05:54.752
And that ring you always wear.

00:05:55.233 --> 00:05:56.432
It's made of plastic

00:05:56.713 --> 00:05:57.992
with badly worn paint.

00:05:57.992 --> 00:05:58.793
I think

00:05:58.793 --> 00:06:01.552
he gave it to you
when you played house as kids.

00:06:03.713 --> 00:06:04.552
Am I right?

00:06:14.512 --> 00:06:16.752
You flaunt it in front of him daily,

00:06:17.233 --> 00:06:18.992
yet he shows zero reaction.

00:06:20.312 --> 00:06:21.153
Two possibilities.

00:06:21.153 --> 00:06:21.872
First,

00:06:21.992 --> 00:06:24.673
he's completely rejected you
in his heart.

00:06:25.072 --> 00:06:25.713
Second,

00:06:26.233 --> 00:06:28.233
he forgot about this ages ago.

00:06:31.416 --> 00:06:33.464
Little Qian has always had someone
in his heart.

00:06:34.392 --> 00:06:35.192
And it's not me.

00:06:37.192 --> 00:06:39.872
I hear it's trendy now
for girls to pursue guys.

00:06:40.273 --> 00:06:41.552
Why not try pursuing me instead?

00:06:41.793 --> 00:06:42.713
For a change.

00:06:47.552 --> 00:06:48.192
Get lost.

00:06:54.392 --> 00:06:54.992
Okay.

00:06:57.632 --> 00:06:58.312
Qing,

00:06:59.312 --> 00:07:02.392
our boss, Xiang, wants a word with you.

00:07:21.673 --> 00:07:23.392
When can we meet Mr. Bao?

00:07:27.432 --> 00:07:29.392
What do you mean by 'the right time'?

00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:32.512
Can you speak for Huo?

00:07:36.392 --> 00:07:39.512
My words are Huo's words.

00:07:48.632 --> 00:07:50.072
Qiang's side is all set.

00:07:50.673 --> 00:07:52.273
I thought it would take more convincing.

00:07:52.632 --> 00:07:54.793
Didn't expect that woman
to agree so readily.

00:07:56.392 --> 00:07:59.593
This time, Huo sent his woman
to liaise with us.

00:08:00.473 --> 00:08:04.113
Seems he's taking this cooperation
pretty seriously.

00:08:05.913 --> 00:08:07.312
What's the name of Huo's woman?

00:08:07.952 --> 00:08:10.192
She is... Dan Qing.

00:08:10.713 --> 00:08:11.512
Dan Qing?

00:08:15.992 --> 00:08:18.200
Engrossed in painting, time flies.
[*"Dan Qing" means "Painting" in Chinese]

00:08:19.593 --> 00:08:22.512
Wealth and fame
are fleeting clouds to me.

00:08:24.793 --> 00:08:25.593
Good name.

00:08:59.433 --> 00:09:00.553
You raced all night.

00:09:00.553 --> 00:09:02.272
Why are you still so worked up?

00:09:03.073 --> 00:09:04.032
Feeling down?

00:09:06.313 --> 00:09:07.713
What's with the suspect?

00:09:07.713 --> 00:09:09.313
I just don't get him.

00:09:09.313 --> 00:09:10.632
He's seriously disturbed.

00:09:17.792 --> 00:09:18.752
Do you really like her?

00:09:20.713 --> 00:09:21.512
I do.

00:09:22.152 --> 00:09:23.473
Han Zhao is a good girl.

00:09:24.073 --> 00:09:26.433
If you really like her,
pursue her properly.

00:09:27.953 --> 00:09:29.392
So, won't you help me?

00:09:29.833 --> 00:09:30.953
If you don't help me,

00:09:31.553 --> 00:09:32.672
what if I fail?

00:09:44.392 --> 00:09:47.152
Little Zhao told me you have

00:09:47.272 --> 00:09:48.833
a longtime unrequited love.

00:09:49.272 --> 00:09:49.953
Tell me about it.

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:53.632
Not your business.

00:10:39.912 --> 00:10:41.152
When did you start smoking?

00:10:42.233 --> 00:10:43.032
Give me one.

00:10:45.272 --> 00:10:46.272
What are you here for?

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:51.032
What?

00:10:52.872 --> 00:10:56.752
Your little dog bite
is more telling than the suspect's.

00:10:57.992 --> 00:10:59.632
See? Teeth bite marks.

00:10:59.632 --> 00:11:00.992
We've got a lead on our case.

00:11:05.193 --> 00:11:06.872
Get back before your master sees you.

00:11:08.032 --> 00:11:08.632
Lei,

00:11:09.193 --> 00:11:10.473
I need the cigarette butt photos

00:11:10.473 --> 00:11:11.473
to compare bite marks.

00:11:26.992 --> 00:11:30.353
The bite marks on all cigarette butts
left at the crime scenes are very deep.

00:11:30.593 --> 00:11:32.872
This reflects
the suspect's smoking habit.

00:11:33.313 --> 00:11:36.152
He likely doesn't hold the cigarette
with his hand much while smoking.

00:11:36.152 --> 00:11:38.473
Instead, he bites the cigarette
to take breaths.

00:11:38.672 --> 00:11:39.473
I speculate

00:11:39.473 --> 00:11:42.113
this habit is directly related
to the nature of his work.

00:11:43.152 --> 00:11:45.752
Do you think it's possible
that some people have a habit

00:11:45.752 --> 00:11:47.672
of biting down hard on the cigarette,

00:11:48.193 --> 00:11:49.272
taking a couple of puffs,

00:11:50.392 --> 00:11:51.672
and taking it with their hand?

00:11:53.433 --> 00:11:54.512
That's possible.

00:11:54.632 --> 00:11:57.593
But that would be a specific trait,

00:11:58.313 --> 00:11:59.113
rarely occurring.

00:11:59.113 --> 00:12:00.272
And if that were the case,

00:12:00.593 --> 00:12:03.313
the bite marks should be
from the upper and lower incisors,

00:12:04.473 --> 00:12:05.752
which are narrower.

00:12:06.553 --> 00:12:09.032
But look at those photos.
They're all molar marks.

00:12:11.632 --> 00:12:12.553
It's simple.

00:12:12.553 --> 00:12:13.336
He...

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:14.912
Just...

00:12:14.912 --> 00:12:15.713
Open wide.

00:12:17.073 --> 00:12:17.872
See?

00:12:18.073 --> 00:12:20.672
By biting the cigarette with his molars,

00:12:21.992 --> 00:12:23.473
it doesn't interfere with work

00:12:23.553 --> 00:12:25.193
or let the smoke sting his eyes.

00:12:27.096 --> 00:12:28.888
The locations of these three cases

00:12:28.888 --> 00:12:30.360
(Chen Xiaomeng, Weigang Street, Attempted Rape)
are Weigang Street,

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.568
(Li Ying, Tianpeng Street, Rape)
Tianpeng Street, and Huaibei Road.

00:12:32.568 --> 00:12:33.353
(Guo Bingbing, Huaibei Road,
Rape and Murder)

00:12:33.353 --> 00:12:35.632
They're across the city's east,
west, and north areas,

00:12:36.032 --> 00:12:37.792
tens of kilometers apart.

00:12:38.392 --> 00:12:39.912
The suspect is a mobile criminal.

00:12:40.073 --> 00:12:41.872
The interval between crimes
is about 15 days.

00:12:42.713 --> 00:12:46.512
Biting cigarette butts with molars
is common among heavy manual laborers.

00:12:47.233 --> 00:12:50.953
A renovation worker
fits the suspect's profile perfectly.

00:12:51.272 --> 00:12:52.313
And coincidentally,

00:12:52.512 --> 00:12:55.833
all three scenes are surrounded
by renovation sites.

00:12:56.752 --> 00:12:59.593
Combined with the suspect's
shabby clothing

00:12:59.832 --> 00:13:01.632
(Yunxi City Map)
and poor economic status,

00:13:02.233 --> 00:13:03.433
we can first hypothesize

00:13:03.872 --> 00:13:05.912
that the suspect works at a nearby site.

00:13:06.152 --> 00:13:09.113
His stint ends in around two weeks.

00:13:09.752 --> 00:13:11.672
He chose these three locations

00:13:12.193 --> 00:13:14.392
because he happened
to be working nearby.

00:13:14.953 --> 00:13:18.392
The expensive cigarettes
were likely given by his employer.

00:13:18.392 --> 00:13:21.752
And the cheap ones
must be his own purchase.

00:13:21.752 --> 00:13:23.632
Following this reasoning,

00:13:24.953 --> 00:13:27.313
there are quite a few trades
involved in renovation.

00:13:27.953 --> 00:13:30.433
Carpenters, masons, painters,
electricians, and plumbers.

00:13:31.992 --> 00:13:34.792
That's a lot of people to investigate.

00:13:36.912 --> 00:13:39.833
We conducted
field investigations on this.

00:13:40.152 --> 00:13:42.992
Plumbers and electricians
kick up a lot of dust while working.

00:13:43.233 --> 00:13:44.752
They generally don't smoke on the job.

00:13:45.433 --> 00:13:47.353
Nor do they smoke
by biting the cigarette butt.

00:13:51.872 --> 00:13:52.553
Ruled out.

00:13:58.672 --> 00:14:00.392
Painters wear masks when spraying paint

00:14:00.752 --> 00:14:02.272
to prevent inhaling harmful fumes.

00:14:02.833 --> 00:14:03.512
Ruled out.

00:14:09.473 --> 00:14:11.593
Carpenters make up
a large portion of renovation work.

00:14:11.632 --> 00:14:12.833
They work longer terms.

00:14:12.833 --> 00:14:14.113
And wood dust is fine,

00:14:14.113 --> 00:14:15.632
hard to clean off completely.

00:14:16.713 --> 00:14:19.272
But no wood shavings
were found on any of the three victims.

00:14:19.872 --> 00:14:20.833
Ruled out too.

00:14:35.593 --> 00:14:36.313
Masons

00:14:36.953 --> 00:14:38.473
require both hands for their work

00:14:38.992 --> 00:14:40.193
and likely work short-term.

00:14:40.992 --> 00:14:42.872
And they're exposed to a lot of dust.

00:14:43.593 --> 00:14:46.512
This matches the victims' description
of the suspect's characteristics.

00:14:47.473 --> 00:14:48.872
Ye Qian, here's what you do.

00:14:48.872 --> 00:14:49.912
Notify everyone

00:14:50.073 --> 00:14:52.672
to focus on all residences
around the crime scenes,

00:14:53.272 --> 00:14:55.512
both completed renovations
and those currently underway,

00:14:55.833 --> 00:14:57.272
to check the renovation crews.

00:14:58.152 --> 00:14:59.872
Prioritize investigating them

00:15:00.073 --> 00:15:01.392
to find any leads.

00:15:01.392 --> 00:15:02.152
Got it.

00:15:04.312 --> 00:15:07.064
(Welcome
to Yehai Building Materials Mall)

00:15:17.861 --> 00:15:22.360
(Buffet Restaurant)

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.408
(Meidu Concept
Decoration Engineering Co., Ltd.)

00:15:56.392 --> 00:15:57.073
Chief Xu,

00:15:57.313 --> 00:16:00.152
there are two renovation companies
that fit the criteria.

00:16:00.553 --> 00:16:02.433
Both are leading companies in the city.

00:16:02.752 --> 00:16:04.553
Each has over a hundred employees.

00:16:04.752 --> 00:16:06.872
If we DNA test everyone,

00:16:06.872 --> 00:16:08.713
it could easily alert the suspect.

00:16:08.953 --> 00:16:11.953
I suggest we investigate covertly

00:16:12.272 --> 00:16:13.872
to avoid tipping him off.

00:16:15.353 --> 00:16:17.713
As for suspects linked to the fishpond,

00:16:17.713 --> 00:16:19.392
there are about sixty.

00:16:20.833 --> 00:16:23.392
Any with prior records among them?

00:16:23.392 --> 00:16:24.032
Yes.

00:16:24.152 --> 00:16:25.992
Three have theft records.

00:16:26.193 --> 00:16:27.713
Two with sexual assault records.

00:16:28.433 --> 00:16:29.392
And they both

00:16:30.512 --> 00:16:31.512
are masons.

00:16:31.992 --> 00:16:33.313
One is Jiang Lianhong.

00:16:33.313 --> 00:16:34.353
The other is Wang En'tai.

00:16:34.632 --> 00:16:35.353
Wang En'tai

00:16:35.353 --> 00:16:37.473
had a work injury a month ago.

00:16:37.672 --> 00:16:39.032
His leg is in a cast.

00:16:39.152 --> 00:16:40.032
He can be ruled out.

00:16:40.473 --> 00:16:41.872
Have you located Jiang Lianhong?

00:16:41.992 --> 00:16:42.953
We've sent people on it.

00:18:46.872 --> 00:18:48.313
Ouch. It's me.

00:18:48.313 --> 00:18:49.113
Qian.

00:18:49.593 --> 00:18:50.472
Why are you here?

00:18:51.952 --> 00:18:53.672
You don't know your own strength.

00:18:53.672 --> 00:18:55.113
I shouldn't have come to you.

00:19:02.793 --> 00:19:03.593
Got news?

00:19:03.872 --> 00:19:04.593
No news.

00:19:12.872 --> 00:19:14.113
I've been trying to find her

00:19:15.392 --> 00:19:16.472
for almost ten years.

00:19:18.632 --> 00:19:20.113
Maybe I was mistaken.

00:19:22.113 --> 00:19:23.712
Won't know unless we try, right?

00:19:29.232 --> 00:19:30.232
I have a friend

00:19:30.513 --> 00:19:32.313
who works at this taxi company.

00:19:39.872 --> 00:19:41.432
I've done you another big favor.

00:19:42.033 --> 00:19:43.192
Next time you cook,

00:19:43.192 --> 00:19:44.232
count me in?

00:19:46.033 --> 00:19:46.753
Get lost.

00:19:50.152 --> 00:19:51.113
A hobble for livestock.

00:19:51.672 --> 00:19:52.232
I felt

00:19:52.232 --> 00:19:54.113
I'd seen it somewhere before.

00:19:54.113 --> 00:19:55.793
It took me a while to remember.

00:19:55.912 --> 00:19:59.593
As a kid, I found something similar
in my hometown pigpen.

00:20:01.313 --> 00:20:01.952
Chief Xu.

00:20:02.232 --> 00:20:02.793
Chief Xu.

00:20:03.712 --> 00:20:04.513
Proceed.

00:20:05.353 --> 00:20:07.432
Most people
have never even seen this thing.

00:20:07.553 --> 00:20:08.872
Let alone bought it.

00:20:09.672 --> 00:20:12.313
Only manufacturers, vets,

00:20:12.513 --> 00:20:14.113
or vet assistants would have access.

00:20:14.313 --> 00:20:15.192
Little Qian and I

00:20:15.192 --> 00:20:18.273
searched the whole city
to buy this thing.

00:20:18.776 --> 00:20:20.273
Chief Xu, the ligature mark's photo.

00:20:26.553 --> 00:20:27.513
A perfect match.

00:20:28.993 --> 00:20:30.152
According to the seller,

00:20:30.833 --> 00:20:31.833
snares of this pattern

00:20:32.353 --> 00:20:35.672
were sold to two farms
in the city back then.

00:20:36.432 --> 00:20:39.432
One is in the Taohua Village
in the west,

00:20:39.513 --> 00:20:42.432
and the other
is in Niulangang in the south.

00:20:43.553 --> 00:20:45.553
Both farms have

00:20:45.553 --> 00:20:46.872
more than 60 people.

00:20:46.872 --> 00:20:47.912
We need to screen them all

00:20:48.033 --> 00:20:50.073
to find the key lead.

00:20:53.712 --> 00:20:55.033
Sure about these measurements?

00:20:55.033 --> 00:20:57.353
No problem. Sofas are usually 900,

00:20:57.353 --> 00:20:58.472
and coffee tables 600.

00:20:58.472 --> 00:20:59.712
They'll fit here fine.

00:21:01.073 --> 00:21:01.872
Police.

00:21:02.712 --> 00:21:04.113
Take the client to see other rooms.

00:21:04.273 --> 00:21:05.232
Okay, come with me.

00:21:06.328 --> 00:21:07.392
Where's Jiang Lianhong?

00:21:08.392 --> 00:21:11.593
H-He left.

00:21:12.553 --> 00:21:13.192
He left?

00:21:13.353 --> 00:21:14.152
Yes.

00:21:14.472 --> 00:21:17.392
Today was the last day
for the masonry work.

00:21:17.833 --> 00:21:19.912
So he left after finishing.

00:21:20.672 --> 00:21:21.593
I'm the manager.

00:21:21.593 --> 00:21:23.793
You can talk to me.

00:21:23.793 --> 00:21:24.472
Where did he go?

00:21:24.472 --> 00:21:25.432
Can you reach him?

00:21:26.192 --> 00:21:27.553
H-He probably went home.

00:21:28.872 --> 00:21:30.392
Reach him now. Call him.

00:21:30.833 --> 00:21:31.912
Alright.

00:21:35.273 --> 00:21:36.513
Where did I put my bag?

00:21:36.912 --> 00:21:38.513
I-I need to grab my phone.

00:22:02.793 --> 00:22:03.472
Hello?

00:22:06.593 --> 00:22:08.033
T-That's impossible.

00:22:10.712 --> 00:22:11.432
Okay.

00:22:11.432 --> 00:22:13.152
I-I'll be right back.

00:22:26.632 --> 00:22:27.753
Which brick is loose?

00:22:30.033 --> 00:22:31.033
Which brick is loose?

00:22:31.472 --> 00:22:32.353
They want to see you.

00:22:33.833 --> 00:22:34.833
Jiang Lianhong, right?

00:22:36.793 --> 00:22:38.392
Police. We have some questions for you.

00:22:49.472 --> 00:22:50.672
W-What's this about?

00:22:52.912 --> 00:22:54.033
What's that in your hand?

00:22:56.353 --> 00:22:57.152
N-Nothing.

00:23:16.113 --> 00:23:18.113
Why does the bag smell
so strongly of fish?

00:23:19.872 --> 00:23:20.872
I don't know.

00:23:26.593 --> 00:23:27.353
Take him away.

00:23:29.033 --> 00:23:30.113
I... Wait.

00:23:30.553 --> 00:23:31.152
Brother.

00:23:31.392 --> 00:23:31.833
Move.

00:23:31.952 --> 00:23:33.073
Wait. Brother.

00:23:49.632 --> 00:23:50.313
Name?

00:23:52.073 --> 00:23:52.872
Jiang Lianhong.

00:23:53.113 --> 00:23:53.753
Address?

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.313
Niulangang, South Suburbs.

00:23:57.513 --> 00:23:58.192
Age?

00:23:58.952 --> 00:23:59.753
39.

00:24:01.273 --> 00:24:02.073
Jiang Lianhong,

00:24:02.912 --> 00:24:04.553
I have a few questions for you.

00:24:05.593 --> 00:24:09.392
You only need to answer yes or no.

00:24:12.392 --> 00:24:14.872
Starting last September,

00:24:14.872 --> 00:24:21.192
you leased a fishpond in Group 3,
Xiaojiang Village, Niulangang, correct?

00:24:22.993 --> 00:24:24.472
Answer yes or no.

00:24:28.313 --> 00:24:28.993
Yes.

00:24:29.273 --> 00:24:30.392
Over the past few years,

00:24:31.392 --> 00:24:35.712
you also assisted the local vet
in treating livestock, right?

00:24:36.073 --> 00:24:36.833
Yeah.

00:24:36.993 --> 00:24:38.593
And starting this March,

00:24:39.472 --> 00:24:44.672
a villager helped you become a mason
at Meidu Concept Decoration Company?

00:24:46.472 --> 00:24:47.152
Yes.

00:24:48.152 --> 00:24:50.632
The cases on Weigang Street,
Tianpeng Street,

00:24:50.872 --> 00:24:53.432
and Huaibei Road

00:24:54.033 --> 00:24:55.152
were all your doing, right?

00:24:55.313 --> 00:24:56.113
No.

00:24:56.824 --> 00:24:57.513
I didn't do it.

00:24:57.513 --> 00:24:58.672
You've got the wrong person.

00:24:58.753 --> 00:25:00.232
If you didn't do it, why did you run?

00:25:00.712 --> 00:25:03.753
I-I got into a fight at the hospital.

00:25:03.952 --> 00:25:04.993
I fought with a doctor.

00:25:04.993 --> 00:25:06.113
I thought it was about that.

00:25:09.432 --> 00:25:10.152
Chief Xu.

00:25:12.833 --> 00:25:13.632
How's it going?

00:25:14.073 --> 00:25:14.872
He's denying it.

00:25:15.353 --> 00:25:17.033
I heard the murder weapon wasn't found.

00:25:17.273 --> 00:25:18.672
What about the DNA results?

00:25:19.273 --> 00:25:21.073
Ziwu said they'll be out soon.

00:25:21.712 --> 00:25:22.672
Hurry them up.

00:25:23.353 --> 00:25:24.672
Okay, I'm on it.

00:25:30.353 --> 00:25:31.513
Seen this girl before?

00:25:32.513 --> 00:25:33.152
Yes.

00:25:34.672 --> 00:25:35.712
Looks just like her.

00:25:36.993 --> 00:25:38.472
She's obviously trouble.

00:25:40.313 --> 00:25:41.993
Hanging out with a bunch of punks.

00:25:42.232 --> 00:25:43.392
Completely thuggish.

00:25:43.833 --> 00:25:45.273
My hands are definitely swollen.

00:25:45.273 --> 00:25:46.152
Rub them later.

00:25:46.152 --> 00:25:47.513
Got it. I'll rub them later.

00:25:53.464 --> 00:25:54.593
What're you looking at?

00:25:57.672 --> 00:25:59.432
I'm talking to you.

00:26:00.952 --> 00:26:01.753
And her?

00:26:05.632 --> 00:26:06.553
I've seen her too.

00:26:11.593 --> 00:26:12.392
You have no idea.

00:26:13.353 --> 00:26:14.833
Her mother was awful.

00:26:16.952 --> 00:26:18.232
Why isn't the bus here yet?

00:26:21.192 --> 00:26:23.033
Well? Did you remember
all you learned today?

00:26:25.712 --> 00:26:27.273
It's 200 yuan a lesson.

00:26:27.432 --> 00:26:28.793
You better study hard.

00:26:29.232 --> 00:26:31.033
If you don't get
into a good high school,

00:26:31.033 --> 00:26:32.553
you won't get into a good college.

00:26:33.152 --> 00:26:33.952
Can't you see?

00:26:33.952 --> 00:26:35.392
So many graduates from good schools

00:26:35.392 --> 00:26:37.232
can't even find jobs these days.

00:26:38.152 --> 00:26:39.833
If you don't get into a good college,

00:26:40.232 --> 00:26:41.593
you'll starve later.

00:26:43.993 --> 00:26:44.993
It's coming.

00:27:02.152 --> 00:27:03.232
You country bumpkin.

00:27:03.672 --> 00:27:04.833
Stop pushing.

00:27:05.353 --> 00:27:06.833
Trying to cop a feel, are you?

00:27:06.833 --> 00:27:08.073
I'll call the cops on you.

00:27:14.712 --> 00:27:15.392
Chief Xu,

00:27:15.753 --> 00:27:17.273
it's been confirmed. Two days ago,

00:27:17.273 --> 00:27:19.912
Jiang Lianhong did have a fight
with a doctor at City Hospital.

00:27:20.353 --> 00:27:21.833
Jiang Lianhong's dad has uremia.

00:27:21.993 --> 00:27:23.073
Whenever he has dialysis,

00:27:23.073 --> 00:27:25.033
Jiang Lianhong accompanies him.

00:27:25.553 --> 00:27:27.472
According to nurses at City Hospital,

00:27:27.712 --> 00:27:31.753
Jiang Lianhong often conflicts
with doctors over minor issues

00:27:31.753 --> 00:27:32.833
and picks on them.

00:27:33.273 --> 00:27:34.273
It happened two days ago.

00:27:34.392 --> 00:27:36.432
The doctor told him to wait outside

00:27:36.432 --> 00:27:37.472
for his own turn.

00:27:37.712 --> 00:27:39.033
And he attacked the doctor.

00:27:39.073 --> 00:27:40.192
Quite the temper.

00:27:41.753 --> 00:27:42.353
Well,

00:27:43.353 --> 00:27:47.073
check Jiang Lianhong's dad's
medical records at the City Hospital.

00:27:47.073 --> 00:27:50.833
See if there's any overlap in timing
with these three cases.

00:27:51.353 --> 00:27:53.833
If there is, it means he had no time
to commit the crimes.

00:27:54.113 --> 00:27:54.993
Get it checked out.

00:27:55.313 --> 00:27:56.392
Okay, I'm on it.

00:27:59.753 --> 00:28:00.632
I'm a laborer, so?

00:28:01.232 --> 00:28:02.113
I was dirty, so?

00:28:02.113 --> 00:28:03.593
So I couldn't ride the bus?

00:28:03.593 --> 00:28:05.833
She dressed neatly and put on airs.

00:28:05.993 --> 00:28:07.192
Her heart's filthy.

00:28:08.753 --> 00:28:09.833
Those words from her.

00:28:10.152 --> 00:28:11.632
I was embarrassed for that kid.

00:28:14.513 --> 00:28:15.192
Seen her?

00:28:27.113 --> 00:28:28.152
I haven't seen this one.

00:28:28.952 --> 00:28:30.033
You sitting here

00:28:30.432 --> 00:28:33.232
means we've got evidence
linking you to the crimes.

00:28:33.753 --> 00:28:34.632
Confess now.

00:28:35.353 --> 00:28:36.553
I really haven't seen her.

00:28:37.432 --> 00:28:41.513
Did you think incense ash
would kill sperm

00:28:41.513 --> 00:28:43.113
and destroy evidence?

00:28:44.113 --> 00:28:45.392
What era do you think this is?

00:28:46.353 --> 00:28:48.672
Who believes
in that kind of nonsense anymore?

00:28:49.472 --> 00:28:50.672
You know what DNA is?

00:28:52.033 --> 00:28:55.952
Your DNA was found
at all three crime scenes.

00:28:56.273 --> 00:28:57.952
The match results are coming any moment.

00:28:58.432 --> 00:29:00.073
Let's see what excuses you'll have left.

00:29:00.313 --> 00:29:00.872
I...

00:29:04.472 --> 00:29:06.232
Let's talk about this.

00:29:12.113 --> 00:29:13.073
Nothing to talk about.

00:29:13.712 --> 00:29:15.113
22 years ago,

00:29:15.392 --> 00:29:17.353
your rape case confession stated

00:29:18.232 --> 00:29:19.392
you denied it at first

00:29:20.152 --> 00:29:21.273
and later admitted it.

00:29:21.833 --> 00:29:22.672
Why?

00:29:23.273 --> 00:29:24.472
Locked up for two years.

00:29:25.152 --> 00:29:26.513
The village pointed fingers.

00:29:27.472 --> 00:29:29.553
Now you're tied to rape-murder cases.

00:29:31.073 --> 00:29:32.432
What will they think of you now?

00:29:35.392 --> 00:29:36.192
Jiang Lianhong,

00:29:37.392 --> 00:29:41.353
your attitude now
is just like it was 22 years ago.

00:29:42.073 --> 00:29:44.273
Your statements and the evidence
don't match up.

00:29:45.073 --> 00:29:46.553
I admit to the case 22 years ago.

00:29:47.833 --> 00:29:49.113
But not to these three cases.

00:29:49.753 --> 00:29:50.872
I raped someone before,

00:29:50.872 --> 00:29:52.232
so you pin these three on me too?

00:29:52.672 --> 00:29:53.472
I didn't do it.

00:29:54.273 --> 00:29:55.073
Then tell me.

00:29:55.513 --> 00:29:58.353
When you were staring at Chen Xiaomeng

00:29:58.753 --> 00:30:00.513
that day in the square,

00:30:01.672 --> 00:30:02.993
what were you thinking?

00:30:06.192 --> 00:30:07.313
I've been out for some time.

00:30:08.753 --> 00:30:10.273
I haven't even touched a woman's hand.

00:30:12.632 --> 00:30:14.113
Looking isn't illegal, is it?

00:30:15.073 --> 00:30:15.872
Jiang Lianhong,

00:30:16.728 --> 00:30:18.273
we're offering you a deal to confess.

00:30:18.273 --> 00:30:19.313
Turning it down?

00:30:23.672 --> 00:30:24.192
Fine.

00:30:24.712 --> 00:30:25.753
Take a look at this.

00:30:28.553 --> 00:30:29.593
The ligature mark.

00:30:30.993 --> 00:30:31.872
Remember it?

00:30:44.593 --> 00:30:45.553
Think carefully.

00:30:47.513 --> 00:30:48.912
Seems Jiang Lianhong knows

00:30:49.353 --> 00:30:52.392
this is the ligature mark
left by a hobble.

00:30:54.073 --> 00:30:55.632
Why aren't the DNA results out yet?

00:30:55.993 --> 00:30:56.993
I'll push them again.

00:30:59.353 --> 00:31:01.793
He won't give in until he's cornered.

00:31:05.353 --> 00:31:06.313
I did it.

00:31:18.632 --> 00:31:19.232
Chief Xu,

00:31:21.033 --> 00:31:21.952
the results are in.

00:31:27.753 --> 00:31:28.872
After I got out,

00:31:31.152 --> 00:31:32.872
the whole village called me a rapist.

00:31:35.912 --> 00:31:37.273
And my dad got uremia.

00:31:38.432 --> 00:31:39.273
To this day,

00:31:41.712 --> 00:31:43.672
no matchmaker has ever come to my home.

00:31:46.152 --> 00:31:48.392
When I saw these girls,
I-I couldn't help it.

00:31:50.593 --> 00:31:51.392
Which ones?

00:31:53.432 --> 00:31:54.313
These three.

00:31:54.672 --> 00:31:55.793
Why kill Guo Bingbing?

00:31:55.993 --> 00:31:57.192
She saw my face.

00:31:57.513 --> 00:31:59.872
How did you commit these three crimes?

00:32:00.113 --> 00:32:01.793
I've confessed everything I should.

00:32:01.993 --> 00:32:03.553
Sentence me however you want.

00:32:04.073 --> 00:32:05.472
I have nothing more to say.

00:32:05.993 --> 00:32:07.232
Nothing more to say?

00:32:08.912 --> 00:32:09.912
Rape,

00:32:10.553 --> 00:32:11.392
molestation,

00:32:11.712 --> 00:32:12.513
and murder.

00:32:13.632 --> 00:32:15.353
These are still kids in school.

00:32:15.833 --> 00:32:17.073
What is human life to you?

00:32:17.192 --> 00:32:18.432
What do you take the law for?

00:32:19.033 --> 00:32:19.833
Jiang Lianhong,

00:32:20.432 --> 00:32:21.793
what exactly are you hiding?

00:32:21.912 --> 00:32:22.712
Confess.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:27.320
(Zhang Ziwu: The DNA results are in)

00:32:30.392 --> 00:32:31.192
Captain Leng,

00:32:31.513 --> 00:32:34.033
Jiang Lianhong's sample
doesn't match the ones from the scenes.

00:32:34.232 --> 00:32:36.232
But the Y-chromosome match
is exceptionally high

00:32:36.553 --> 00:32:37.553
with paternal lineage.

00:32:37.753 --> 00:32:40.113
The real suspect should be
a male of the Jiang family.

00:32:42.632 --> 00:32:44.152
Reach him now. Call him.

00:32:44.753 --> 00:32:45.672
Alright.

00:32:49.033 --> 00:32:50.472
Where did I put my bag?

00:32:50.472 --> 00:32:52.192
I-I need to grab my phone.

00:33:24.232 --> 00:33:25.192
Why are you lying?

00:33:26.912 --> 00:33:27.753
I'm not lying.

00:33:28.553 --> 00:33:31.632
You knew who it was when you saw
the photo of the ligature mark, right?

00:33:32.472 --> 00:33:33.048
I don't know.

00:33:33.048 --> 00:33:34.273
I don't know what you mean.

00:33:34.313 --> 00:33:35.753
I did the rape and the murder.

00:33:35.753 --> 00:33:36.513
It was all me.

00:33:36.513 --> 00:33:37.952
Just arrest me. Sentence me.

00:33:37.952 --> 00:33:39.833
The DNA results are back.

00:33:40.632 --> 00:33:41.313
It wasn't you.

00:33:42.192 --> 00:33:43.392
If you're locked away,

00:33:44.192 --> 00:33:45.192
what about your dad?

00:33:47.753 --> 00:33:49.033
Who exactly are you protecting?

00:34:02.392 --> 00:34:03.833
Listen up, team.

00:34:03.833 --> 00:34:04.513
Liu Yang,

00:34:04.833 --> 00:34:05.912
check immediately

00:34:05.912 --> 00:34:08.433
if Jiang Honghai returned home tonight.

00:34:09.033 --> 00:34:09.712
Jiao,

00:34:09.792 --> 00:34:11.832
keep working
with the ticketing platforms.

00:34:12.553 --> 00:34:14.953
See if Jiang Honghai
booked any tickets for today.

00:34:15.113 --> 00:34:17.312
Long-distance bus, train, or plane.

00:34:17.993 --> 00:34:19.312
Ziwu and Long, come with me.

00:34:19.312 --> 00:34:19.993
Let's go.

00:34:19.993 --> 00:34:20.513
Yes.

00:34:36.033 --> 00:34:36.712
Jiang,

00:34:37.792 --> 00:34:39.513
when are you paying this month's rent?

00:35:21.312 --> 00:35:21.873
Hello?

00:35:21.993 --> 00:35:22.792
Captain Leng,

00:35:22.953 --> 00:35:25.073
local police
at Jiang Honghai's hukou location

00:35:25.073 --> 00:35:27.192
said he hasn't returned home
in six months.

00:35:35.073 --> 00:35:35.832
Hold on.

00:35:37.232 --> 00:35:37.953
Hold on.

00:35:41.176 --> 00:35:42.473
(Yunxi International Airport
Ticketing Backend System)

00:35:42.473 --> 00:35:43.993
Captain Leng, we found it.

00:35:44.433 --> 00:35:47.632
Jiang Honghai booked a flight
to Shenzhen departing at 8:42 PM.

00:35:47.873 --> 00:35:49.352
He's likely through security by now.

00:35:53.113 --> 00:35:53.752
Chief Xu,

00:35:54.553 --> 00:35:56.712
we're on the way to the airport now.

00:35:57.272 --> 00:35:57.752
Yes.

00:35:57.752 --> 00:36:00.672
We've contacted the officers
at the airport.

00:36:01.832 --> 00:36:02.953
They'll assist. Right.

00:36:03.593 --> 00:36:06.232
We'll apprehend the suspect
the moment he appears.

00:36:06.473 --> 00:36:07.113
Rest assured.

00:36:08.033 --> 00:36:08.672
Hurry.

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:11.548
(Sterile Room)

00:36:37.352 --> 00:36:38.073
Captain Leng,

00:36:38.953 --> 00:36:41.672
DNA from the cigarette butts
perfectly matches Jiang Honghai.

00:36:48.632 --> 00:36:50.073
The departure time has passed.

00:36:50.073 --> 00:36:51.272
Jiang Honghai didn't board.

00:36:58.433 --> 00:36:59.393
Okay, Master.

00:37:17.152 --> 00:37:18.232
Jiang Honghai's gone.

00:37:22.513 --> 00:37:23.712
These are criminal cases.

00:37:24.152 --> 00:37:26.152
Jiang Honghai is suspected
of rape and murder.

00:37:27.553 --> 00:37:29.073
Have you considered the consequences?

00:37:32.593 --> 00:37:34.033
How do you know he did it?

00:37:38.473 --> 00:37:40.553
Listen, you better do this wall right.

00:37:40.632 --> 00:37:41.832
I know how you guys work.

00:37:41.832 --> 00:37:42.873
Don't worry.

00:37:42.873 --> 00:37:44.553
Leave it to me. You can count on it.

00:37:44.752 --> 00:37:45.880
Hurry up. Come on.

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:46.632
We're in a hurry.

00:37:46.913 --> 00:37:48.073
Yes, hurry up.

00:37:48.073 --> 00:37:48.632
Hurry up.

00:37:48.873 --> 00:37:49.832
Don't worry, ma'am.

00:38:25.152 --> 00:38:25.993
Hello? You're here?

00:38:26.513 --> 00:38:27.352
I'll be right out.

00:38:29.352 --> 00:38:30.832
I'll call the cops on you.

00:38:31.832 --> 00:38:32.433
Bad guy!

00:38:32.433 --> 00:38:33.352
Stay away from us.

00:38:53.913 --> 00:38:54.513
Here.

00:38:55.272 --> 00:38:57.473
Use this ruler
to measure this wall properly.

00:39:07.953 --> 00:39:08.593
How much?

00:39:09.113 --> 00:39:09.993
2.5 meters.

00:39:10.473 --> 00:39:11.632
You've got it crooked.

00:39:11.632 --> 00:39:12.672
Move it higher up here.

00:39:16.073 --> 00:39:17.433
(Why are you covering for him?)

00:39:18.393 --> 00:39:19.672
Honghai treated me well.

00:39:22.352 --> 00:39:23.792
After I got out,

00:39:25.232 --> 00:39:26.152
he gave me money,

00:39:28.352 --> 00:39:30.033
pulled strings to get me a job,

00:39:30.033 --> 00:39:31.433
and even found me a place to live.

00:39:34.473 --> 00:39:36.433
Jiang Honghai
can't just vanish into thin air.

00:39:38.033 --> 00:39:38.873
Where is he?

00:39:42.553 --> 00:39:43.792
I really don't know.

00:39:48.513 --> 00:39:51.033
Brief the interrogation results.

00:39:53.393 --> 00:39:54.993
Jiang Honghai is currently missing.

00:39:54.993 --> 00:39:56.232
But what we can confirm is

00:39:56.232 --> 00:39:57.553
he hasn't left Yunxi City yet.

00:39:58.352 --> 00:40:01.232
Any new leads on Jiang Lianhong?

00:40:01.752 --> 00:40:02.752
Not yet.

00:40:03.033 --> 00:40:06.632
He claims he doesn't know
Jiang Honghai's close private contacts.

00:40:06.752 --> 00:40:09.152
Sounds like he's playing us.

00:40:09.632 --> 00:40:10.433
Possibly.

00:40:11.352 --> 00:40:13.033
Captain Leng, food's here.

00:40:13.073 --> 00:40:14.033
Everyone, let's eat.

00:40:14.033 --> 00:40:14.553
Okay.

00:40:14.752 --> 00:40:16.953
Whoever's hungry, dig in. Come on.

00:40:17.953 --> 00:40:18.792
Let's make it quick.

00:40:19.352 --> 00:40:20.152
Go on.

00:40:21.312 --> 00:40:23.913
So, as long as
we catch Jiang Honghai now,

00:40:23.953 --> 00:40:25.513
everything will fall into place.

00:40:25.672 --> 00:40:26.352
Right?

00:40:26.993 --> 00:40:28.352
I'll be on it tomorrow.

00:40:28.553 --> 00:40:29.873
As long as he's still in Yunxi,

00:40:29.873 --> 00:40:31.232
he'll surface eventually.

00:40:32.473 --> 00:40:33.953
Why hasn't Jiang Honghai fled?

00:40:35.672 --> 00:40:36.393
Master.

00:40:37.152 --> 00:40:38.393
Jiang Lianhong said

00:40:39.352 --> 00:40:41.832
Chen Xiaomeng looks
very like someone he knows.

00:40:44.873 --> 00:40:47.553
Don't you guys think Chen Xiaomeng

00:40:47.553 --> 00:40:50.513
looks a bit like He Jie?

00:40:50.553 --> 00:40:53.232
Especially around the eyes and eyebrows.

00:40:53.272 --> 00:40:56.344
(Chen Xiaomeng, He Jie,
Li Ying, Guo Bingbing)

00:40:57.152 --> 00:40:58.553
Jiang Lianhong is definitely hiding

00:40:58.553 --> 00:40:59.473
something else.

00:40:59.993 --> 00:41:05.232
Check again if Jiang Lianhong
and Jiang Honghai contacted anyone else.

00:41:06.113 --> 00:41:07.873
According to Jiang Lianhong's coworkers,

00:41:07.873 --> 00:41:11.553
they often go to a restaurant
on Huaibei Road after work.

00:41:12.232 --> 00:41:13.953
Maybe that place holds some clues.

00:41:14.712 --> 00:41:16.232
Jiao, here's the plan.

00:41:17.232 --> 00:41:21.993
Review footage from Huaibei Road
and Chen Xiaomeng's place.

00:41:22.632 --> 00:41:25.232
See if Jiang Honghai
was caught by the camera.

00:41:26.352 --> 00:41:27.632
Ye and Long,

00:41:27.712 --> 00:41:29.033
head to Chen Xiaomeng's place.

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:30.033
- Hurry.
- Yes.

00:41:30.033 --> 00:41:30.712
Thanks.

00:41:31.152 --> 00:41:31.873
Wang Tong.

00:41:32.433 --> 00:41:33.152
And Liu Yang.

00:41:33.553 --> 00:41:34.832
Let's go have a chat with...

00:41:35.608 --> 00:41:36.752
- Jiang Lianhong.
- Jiang Lianhong.

00:42:10.073 --> 00:42:10.873
Hello, Mom.

00:42:12.152 --> 00:42:13.152
I'm downstairs.

00:42:14.033 --> 00:42:15.312
You're coming to get me?

00:42:15.712 --> 00:42:16.272
No need.

00:42:17.152 --> 00:42:18.672
I'm almost there.

00:42:41.033 --> 00:42:41.832
Chen Xiaomeng.

00:42:49.113 --> 00:42:49.752
Are you okay?

00:42:50.113 --> 00:42:51.553
Police. Don't run.

00:42:54.953 --> 00:42:56.232
It's okay now. It's okay.
