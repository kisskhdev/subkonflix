00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.840
Here, sir.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:49.720
This is yours.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.680
Alright.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.210
Run! Hurry!

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.080
Go!

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.790
Who are you?

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.350
How do you know my spells?

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.600
Your Majesty!

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.240
Ying Du,

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.350
just as I expected,

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.640
once you're separated from Wu Zhaoli,

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.280
you can't wield your full power.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.200
Today, I'll end your life for sure.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.840
Why won't the Grand Princess let me go?

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.840
You could've provoked anyone,

00:02:00.276 --> 00:02:02.760
but you chose to anger the ruler,
whom she cherishes the most.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.840
Naturally, she won't spare you.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.760
You drugged me

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.910
and took me there.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.750
Enough with the pointless talk.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:11.590
Hit her!

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.190
Hit her hard!

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.403
I never thought the Frost Seal

00:02:57.414 --> 00:02:59.000
could link you with Wu Zhaoli.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.190
If she's hurt, you're hurt.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.430
Zhaoli is in danger.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.430
Stop!

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.770
Mr. Luo. (Support Admin Watch on

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.640
What brings you here?

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.520
It's you.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.870
Are you here to kill me too?

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.800
We'll settle our accounts later.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.430
The ruler is in trouble.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.360
Come with me, now!

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.240
Trouble?

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.430
What happened to him?

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.750
The ruler's power
was transferred to you.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.446
There's a spiritual link
between you two.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.120
Only when he connects with you

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.000
can he summon all his power.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.310
So,

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.840
he needs me now.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.680
Let's go save him now.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.240
Let's go.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.750
I didn't expect that this time,

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.750
it would be so easy to take your life.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:11.840
Ying Du!

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.030
I'm here to save you!

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:18.240
Zhaoli, it's dangerous!

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.270
She truly fears nothing
when it comes to you.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.030
Ying Du,

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.390
hang in there.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.760
Zhaoli. (Support Admin Watch on

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.160
Ying Du.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.120
What a pity.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.040
However deep the feeling,

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.800
you'll be separated
by life and death soon.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:26.590
Zhaoli.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:29.790
Ying Du.

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.040
Thank goodness you're unharmed.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.000
I'm fine.

00:05:33.426 --> 00:05:34.800
You ran all the way here like that?

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.646
Were you not afraid of losing your life?

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:41.680
Zhaoli.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:42.590
Zhaoli.

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.480
Why won't Zhaoli's wound heal?

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.000
Zhaoli... Zhaoli.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.640
Your Highness.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.270
Has that healer perished?

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.640
Your Highness,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.455
we had trapped her,

00:06:13.466 --> 00:06:15.160
but just as we beat her
nearly senseless,

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.380
a group suddenly appeared
and struck at the ruler.

00:06:17.391 --> 00:06:18.920
That healer sensed something was wrong

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.240
and forced herself to go save him.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.310
To save him?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.040
Was he harmed?

00:06:23.051 --> 00:06:24.306
You can barely protect yourself,

00:06:24.317 --> 00:06:26.163
yet you still have time to worry
about others.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:30.470
Your...

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.520
Your Majesty.

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:34.240
Your Majesty, please hear me out.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.870
I said no one is allowed to touch her.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:36.740
If you kill me,

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:37.913
Wu Zhaoli will perish as well.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.270
What did you do to Zhaoli?

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.486
I gave her the Anti-Coagulant Powder

00:06:43.497 --> 00:06:44.830
that stops wounds from healing.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.950
Without the antidote,
she'll never recover.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.950
Hand over the antidote.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.080
Your Majesty,

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.720
she's led you into danger
time and again.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.480
I only did this for your sake.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:00.590
Ye Li,

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.720
have you forgotten
what I told you before?

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.190
If you harm another innocent soul,

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:07.870
I won't hesitate
to rid the people of you.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.630
Please, forgive me.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:14.950
I will never dare again.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.560
(Your Majesty,)

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.510
(you truly meant to kill me?)

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:08.190
It was you who saved me?

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.120
Yes. (Support Admin Watch on

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:10.030
Your Highness,

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.190
you've devoted yourself entirely
to the ruler.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.600
Yet he tried to kill you

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.830
for another woman.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.070
It seems he truly feels for Wu Zhaoli.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.160
Your chances are fading fast.
