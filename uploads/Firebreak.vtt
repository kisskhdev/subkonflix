WEBVTT

00:07.833 --> 00:14.708
A FIREBREAK IS A STRIP OF LAND
CLEARED OF TREES IN A FOREST…

00:14.791 --> 00:21.791
OR ANYTHING, OR ANYONE,
THAT CAN STOP A WILDFIRE FROM SPREADING.

00:37.541 --> 00:38.791
Hey! What's up?

00:38.875 --> 00:40.875
-Can you hear me?
-Sounds familiar.

00:40.958 --> 00:43.375
-A trip?
-I'll check my calendar.

00:43.458 --> 00:46.875
-I changed it to Monday.
-I'll see if I can fit it in.

00:46.958 --> 00:50.208
-I didn't go.
-I'll just leave!

01:45.541 --> 01:52.541
FIREBREAK

02:48.833 --> 02:51.291
-We're here. Come on.
-Let's go.

02:51.375 --> 02:54.291
Dani, help your mom.

02:54.375 --> 02:57.541
-Give me a hand, kids.
-You got everything, Lide?

02:57.625 --> 02:59.083
-Here.
-My suitcase.

02:59.166 --> 03:00.708
-Morning, Mara.
-Hi.

03:00.791 --> 03:04.333
I took photos earlier,
so I won't get in your way.

03:04.416 --> 03:06.375
-Okay.
-The furniture's great.

03:06.458 --> 03:08.458
We could ask for 20 grand more.

03:08.541 --> 03:10.958
Yeah, sure. Sounds good.

03:11.041 --> 03:14.166
Here are your keys.
I'll pick them up when you're done.

03:14.250 --> 03:15.458
-I'm Luis.
-Thanks.

03:15.541 --> 03:17.750
-Mara's brother-in-law.
-Nice to meet you.

03:17.833 --> 03:21.416
Don't worry. It'll sell fast.
It's a beautiful house.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.500
Okay. All set.

03:23.583 --> 03:26.500
-Race you!
-All right. I'm thirsty.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.750
We need to pack.

03:28.833 --> 03:30.791
You do it. It's your stuff.

03:30.875 --> 03:33.500
I don't know how to use this.

03:33.583 --> 03:38.041
We'll have one box for donations
and one for trash.

03:38.125 --> 03:40.958
"Donations." Right.

03:41.041 --> 03:42.958
-Don't throw the ball.
-Copycat!

03:43.041 --> 03:44.750
If you don't want to play--

03:44.833 --> 03:46.541
-I do.
-Then go play.

03:57.791 --> 03:59.333
Dani, come help.

03:59.416 --> 04:01.833
Mom, when are we going
for a walk in the woods?

04:01.916 --> 04:04.375
Later. We have to clean up
and eat lunch first.

04:04.458 --> 04:06.625
-Okay?
-All right. Promise?

04:06.708 --> 04:09.000
Sure. Go on.

04:09.083 --> 04:10.583
Dani, play with your cousin.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.500
-Want them?
-Yeah, they belonged to my parents.

04:14.583 --> 04:16.916
-My brother loved this one.
-Come on.

04:19.125 --> 04:21.875
Mara, this is like new.

04:21.958 --> 04:25.375
-You're not keeping it?
-No. I'm not a vest person.

04:25.875 --> 04:31.125
You or Luis can have it.
Just keep it out of my sight.

04:31.208 --> 04:32.708
You must've lost it.

04:33.750 --> 04:34.958
You're it!

04:40.333 --> 04:44.250
-Mara's going to regret this.
-You know how I feel about it.

04:44.333 --> 04:46.708
We can't pretend he never existed.

04:47.750 --> 04:51.375
Selling the house, tossing his clothes…
I mean, he was your brother.

04:51.458 --> 04:55.125
She needs to face her grief,
not run from it.

04:55.208 --> 04:59.666
I think that's exactly
what we're all trying to do here.

05:01.791 --> 05:02.791
Aunt Mara!

05:03.458 --> 05:04.791
-Check it out!
-Dani.

05:06.041 --> 05:07.541
Then you look, Mom!

05:39.416 --> 05:41.125
Delicious. I was starving.

05:41.208 --> 05:43.541
Why are you selling this place? I love it.

05:43.625 --> 05:46.000
-I wouldn't sell it.
-I love it too.

05:46.083 --> 05:47.916
But this is where Dad died.

05:52.166 --> 05:53.666
Lide.

05:54.375 --> 05:56.916
That's not why we're selling it.

05:57.416 --> 05:58.875
Lide, look at me.

05:59.833 --> 06:04.125
We're selling it because
we're buying a beautiful place.

06:04.875 --> 06:06.375
Really nice. By the beach.

06:06.458 --> 06:08.416
-Next to ours.
-Exactly.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.833
So we can spend our vacations together.

06:10.916 --> 06:13.541
-Sounds nice.
-We've talked about this.

06:14.125 --> 06:17.208
-But I like the woods.
-We'll come visit.

06:17.291 --> 06:19.833
-Right, to pick mushrooms.
-Yeah.

06:20.416 --> 06:23.583
If they're smooth and white
on the outside…

06:23.666 --> 06:24.666
Those are edible.

06:24.750 --> 06:27.958
Some are red with white spots. Those are…

06:28.833 --> 06:30.250
Is that the neighbor?

06:30.333 --> 06:32.250
-Those don't grow here.
-Hi, Mara.

06:32.333 --> 06:33.333
Hi, Santiago.

06:33.416 --> 06:34.541
-Hi.
-How are you?

06:34.625 --> 06:35.666
-Come in.
-Can I?

06:35.750 --> 06:37.291
-Of course.
-Hello.

06:37.375 --> 06:38.791
-Come sit.
-I'm good.

06:38.875 --> 06:41.833
-Hi.
-I just ate, and I've got work to do.

06:41.916 --> 06:43.666
The whole family's here.

06:43.750 --> 06:45.750
-My brother-in-law, Luis.
-Hi.

06:45.833 --> 06:47.750
-Gustavo's brother.
-We've met.

06:47.833 --> 06:49.458
You haven't met his wife, Elena.

06:49.541 --> 06:51.375
-Not in person.
-And Dani.

06:51.458 --> 06:52.833
-Hi.
-My nephew.

06:52.916 --> 06:54.541
-And Lide.
-Lide.

06:54.625 --> 06:57.416
I brought something for Lide.
Can I give it to her?

06:57.500 --> 07:00.083
-It's a butterfly.
-Of course. Go head.

07:00.166 --> 07:03.083
Hi, Lide. I brought you something.

07:03.166 --> 07:05.291
-It's from the forest.
-Right.

07:05.375 --> 07:08.125
-What do you say, Lide?
-Thank you.

07:08.208 --> 07:09.750
-Thank you.
-It's nothing.

07:09.833 --> 07:12.791
-So…
-I saw you packing up.

07:12.875 --> 07:17.625
Right. We're selling the house.
We're leaving. Today's our last day.

07:18.750 --> 07:20.458
-Right.
-So…

07:20.541 --> 07:22.666
If you need help or anything…

07:22.750 --> 07:24.083
-Sure.
-Thank you.

07:24.166 --> 07:26.500
-Thanks. Really.
-Have a good one.

07:26.583 --> 07:28.375
-All right, take care.
-You too.

07:28.458 --> 07:29.833
-Bye, Santiago.
-Bye.

07:29.916 --> 07:31.125
-Later.
-Bye.

07:31.208 --> 07:32.416
See you.

07:33.958 --> 07:35.375
He seems nice, huh?

07:36.250 --> 07:37.291
Yeah.

07:37.375 --> 07:41.541
We're not close,
but Gustavo hung out with him.

07:42.666 --> 07:44.708
He saw us hauling boxes all morning.

07:44.791 --> 07:48.375
-And now he offers to help?
-Luis…

07:48.458 --> 07:50.791
When we drive off he'll be like,

07:50.875 --> 07:57.000
"Need a hand, man?
Here I am, smelling like incense."

07:57.500 --> 07:58.958
Is it snowing?

08:27.500 --> 08:31.041
The wildfire has now burned
over 2,500 acres,

08:31.125 --> 08:34.208
and firefighters are working
to contain it.

08:34.291 --> 08:36.625
The prolonged, intense drought…

08:36.708 --> 08:38.083
That's a lot of acres.

08:38.166 --> 08:41.250
…has sped up how fast
the fire is spreading.

08:41.333 --> 08:43.166
Unless the wind changes direction,

08:43.250 --> 08:46.708
the fire is expected to be contained
by nightfall.

08:46.791 --> 08:49.458
There is also hope that the firebreak,

08:49.541 --> 08:53.500
created in late summer,
will keep the flames from spreading…

08:53.583 --> 08:55.750
Firebreaks don't work.

08:55.833 --> 08:57.208
That's all for now.

08:57.291 --> 08:59.958
Now, over to our correspondent…

09:00.041 --> 09:01.333
Let's pack up and go.

09:01.416 --> 09:04.166
-Firebreaks don't work.
-But, Mom.

09:04.250 --> 09:06.666
-We're not staying overnight, right?
-No.

09:06.750 --> 09:09.750
-Dani and I will take the workshop.
-Are you sure?

09:09.833 --> 09:12.916
-You take the bedrooms.
-No need to rush, but…

09:13.000 --> 09:15.250
-It'll be fine.
-We'll go.

09:15.333 --> 09:16.541
-We'll head out.
-Right.

09:16.625 --> 09:18.250
I won't seal all the boxes.

09:18.333 --> 09:20.875
-Let's go.
-We can come back another day.

09:23.500 --> 09:26.916
-Why'd Uncle Gustavo carve so many bears?
-He really liked them.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.250
Your uncle loved the mountains.
We used to come here all the time.

09:30.750 --> 09:33.208
He was really sad when they disappeared.

09:34.750 --> 09:39.125
Come on. We'll take these with us
and wrap them up later.

09:39.208 --> 09:42.541
-Maybe this is fine, though.
-Dad.

09:42.625 --> 09:44.541
-What?
-This is where he died?

09:45.916 --> 09:47.125
That's right.

09:47.208 --> 09:49.666
He wanted to spend his final hours here.

09:50.250 --> 09:52.208
That's why we're here, just you and me.

09:52.291 --> 09:54.708
So Aunt Mara doesn't have to be. Come on.

09:54.791 --> 09:57.416
You take this one.
I'll wrap these up later.

09:59.250 --> 10:00.625
-Got it?
-Yeah.

10:00.708 --> 10:02.083
Yep? Okay.

10:11.166 --> 10:13.625
We can toss this. Don't we have a bag?

10:13.708 --> 10:16.000
-With more.
-No.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.250
That's the last of it.

10:18.333 --> 10:19.666
Let's throw this out.

10:19.750 --> 10:20.958
This too.

10:21.041 --> 10:23.416
Lide, do you have my Rubik's cube?

10:23.500 --> 10:25.666
No. I wouldn't give it to you anyway.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.500
-Let me see that.
-No. It's mine.

10:27.583 --> 10:29.375
-I found it.
-Everything's yours.

10:29.458 --> 10:31.541
-No.
-You always get your way.

10:31.625 --> 10:33.541
-Where's my Rubik's cube?
-No idea.

10:33.625 --> 10:35.458
You said you wouldn't give it back.

10:35.541 --> 10:36.708
-Did not.
-Did too.

10:36.791 --> 10:38.708
-Let me see.
-I said no!

10:38.791 --> 10:40.250
-I found it!
-Let me see!

10:40.333 --> 10:42.666
-You're so annoying!
-Then leave.

10:42.750 --> 10:46.041
-This is my house.
-Not anymore, Lide.

10:48.333 --> 10:50.333
Keep your binoculars.

10:53.375 --> 10:56.791
I'm donating most of this.
Grab anything you want.

10:56.875 --> 11:00.833
Mom, look what I found.
I'll fill my canteen, and we can head out.

11:00.916 --> 11:03.458
We can't, honey. There's a fire.

11:04.041 --> 11:05.125
We need to leave.

11:05.208 --> 11:08.916
-We were supposed to say goodbye.
-We can't, sweetie.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.625
-It's really dangerous.
-You said we could.

11:12.708 --> 11:14.750
I know, but there's a fire.

11:14.833 --> 11:16.750
Will the hut burn down?

11:16.833 --> 11:20.916
It won't. The fire's far away.
But we need to pack up and go.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.208
-Come on.
-I don't care about the fire.

11:23.916 --> 11:27.458
We were supposed to go to the woods
and say goodbye together.

11:27.541 --> 11:29.000
I know, but there's a fire.

11:29.083 --> 11:31.875
-We were supposed to do it together!
-That's enough.

11:31.958 --> 11:34.083
We were supposed to say goodbye together!

11:34.166 --> 11:36.833
-There's a fire. Stop being ridiculous!
-I don't care!

11:36.916 --> 11:39.791
I don't care if you don't care.
Go pack up your things.

11:39.875 --> 11:42.458
-You liar!
-Go pack up your things!

11:42.541 --> 11:44.708
-No!
-I'm not telling you again.

11:45.500 --> 11:46.708
Go!

11:51.000 --> 11:52.833
Don't throw things!

12:00.083 --> 12:02.416
-Should I go talk to her?
-No.

12:02.500 --> 12:04.750
She's making this so hard for me.

12:08.500 --> 12:09.916
-Mara…
-What?

12:13.500 --> 12:14.500
What is it?

12:17.125 --> 12:18.458
These too?

12:19.500 --> 12:21.750
STORAGE

12:23.708 --> 12:25.666
You were together your whole lives.

12:28.625 --> 12:29.708
Exactly.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.875
And he still chose
not to fight until the end.

12:34.125 --> 12:35.708
Not even for us.

12:49.750 --> 12:53.708
-I'll do the kitchen.
-Yeah? Then I'll…

12:53.791 --> 12:55.916
Dani, come help us.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.666
Dani is a big help.

14:05.458 --> 14:07.250
-Time to go.
-Is that everything?

14:07.333 --> 14:09.083
-The car's loaded.
-All right.

14:09.166 --> 14:10.291
You ready, Dani?

14:11.416 --> 14:14.208
Dani, where's your cousin?

14:14.291 --> 14:15.416
No idea.

14:17.375 --> 14:19.958
-So that's it?
-Yeah, all set.

14:20.041 --> 14:22.833
Lide, sweetie, we're leaving.

14:25.625 --> 14:26.625
Lide.

14:38.708 --> 14:40.625
Did I leave my jacket in there?

14:40.708 --> 14:42.666
Not sure. Maybe in the bedroom?

14:42.750 --> 14:46.166
-Dani, buckle up.
-That's Lide's seat.

14:46.250 --> 14:49.583
I can't find Lide.
Dani, where's your cousin?

14:49.666 --> 14:51.916
-No idea. She's around.
-Where?

14:52.000 --> 14:53.166
How should I know?

14:56.291 --> 14:58.083
-Luis…
-Coming.

15:02.500 --> 15:03.541
Let me.

15:04.041 --> 15:05.125
Lide?

15:07.000 --> 15:10.916
She's not in there.
I bet she went to the hut.

15:11.625 --> 15:13.708
-She's not in there?
-She's in the hut.

15:13.791 --> 15:15.791
I told her not to go, but she still…

15:15.875 --> 15:17.666
-I'll go get her.
-I'll come too.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.583
-Call if she comes back.
-Okay.

15:20.166 --> 15:22.750
Come on. Let's wait inside.

15:22.833 --> 15:24.583
-Santi.
-Yeah?

15:24.666 --> 15:26.958
-Have you seen Lide?
-Yeah.

15:27.041 --> 15:29.541
-Where?
-In the hut. Just now.

15:29.625 --> 15:31.875
-I knew it.
-You know there's a fire, right?

15:31.958 --> 15:33.375
-Yeah, thanks.
-Yep.

15:33.458 --> 15:34.666
No worries.

15:43.375 --> 15:44.416
Lide.

16:08.958 --> 16:10.416
Lide!

16:10.500 --> 16:11.708
Lide!

16:20.000 --> 16:21.208
Lide!

16:23.791 --> 16:26.333
Mara, what's wrong?

16:26.833 --> 16:28.375
Lide's not in the hut.

16:28.458 --> 16:30.291
That's weird. She was just here.

16:30.375 --> 16:33.041
-You sure?
-Yeah, just a minute ago.

16:33.125 --> 16:36.291
-Inside?
-Yeah, right there.

16:36.375 --> 16:39.041
Luis, call Elena.
Ask if Lide's at the house.

16:41.625 --> 16:42.625
Yeah?

16:42.708 --> 16:45.250
-Hey, hon. Is she with you?
-No.

16:45.333 --> 16:48.166
-She's not here.
-No.

16:51.708 --> 16:53.791
Lide!

16:54.375 --> 16:55.500
Lide!

16:56.500 --> 16:57.583
Lide!

17:02.375 --> 17:03.708
Where is she, Luis?

17:05.541 --> 17:08.375
-If she's not in the hut, where is she?
-No idea.

17:09.583 --> 17:10.583
Lide!

17:10.666 --> 17:12.541
Everything looks the same out here.

17:13.125 --> 17:14.791
Lide!

17:19.375 --> 17:21.750
Luis, can you call Elena?

17:21.833 --> 17:23.416
Maybe she got turned around.

17:23.500 --> 17:27.125
No, she's not here.
Probably got lost in the woods.

17:27.208 --> 17:31.125
-Lide, please, honey!
-I can't hear you. Can you hear me?

17:31.208 --> 17:32.791
Lide!

17:32.875 --> 17:36.250
Baby, please don't do this.
Don't do this to me.

18:59.041 --> 19:00.041
Afternoon.

19:00.125 --> 19:01.750
-Hello.
-Good afternoon.

19:02.375 --> 19:07.125
Hello. I'm Sergeant Revuelta,
head of the Missing Persons Unit.

19:07.208 --> 19:09.000
-Corporal Baranda.
-I'm her mother.

19:09.083 --> 19:12.041
-I'm her husband's brother.
-And I'm his wife.

19:12.125 --> 19:15.041
Right. So your daughter is 8?

19:15.125 --> 19:16.125
Almost 9.

19:16.208 --> 19:18.625
When did you notice she was missing?

19:18.708 --> 19:20.208
-Just after lunch.
-Yeah.

19:20.291 --> 19:21.666
What time?

19:21.750 --> 19:24.583
-Around 3:00.
-Excuse me. Santiago!

19:24.666 --> 19:27.041
-Can you come here?
-What was she wearing?

19:27.125 --> 19:29.000
-For just a minute.
-A white top.

19:29.083 --> 19:31.208
Yeah, a light blue jacket.

19:31.291 --> 19:33.583
This is our neighbor.

19:33.666 --> 19:34.833
Hi. Good afternoon.

19:34.916 --> 19:39.541
He was the last person to see her
in a hut she'd built with her dad.

19:39.625 --> 19:41.083
Is her father here?

19:41.166 --> 19:43.208
No. My brother passed away.

19:43.291 --> 19:46.000
I'm sorry.
You were the last person to see her?

19:46.083 --> 19:48.125
-Yes.
-Did you talk to her?

19:48.208 --> 19:50.083
-I did.
-About what?

19:51.750 --> 19:53.833
-Nothing important.
-Nothing important?

19:53.916 --> 19:57.750
Did you notice any strange behavior?

19:58.500 --> 19:59.750
Was she anxious?

19:59.833 --> 20:03.208
I did find it strange at first.
Because of the fire.

20:03.291 --> 20:08.000
But she seemed calm,
and we talked for a bit.

20:08.083 --> 20:12.541
I figured she could find her own way back,
and I left.

20:12.625 --> 20:15.583
You didn't think it was odd
she was alone in the woods?

20:15.666 --> 20:18.000
-No.
-What were you doing at the hut?

20:18.083 --> 20:20.333
I work for the Department of Environment.

20:20.416 --> 20:22.416
-I'm in charge of the firebreak.
-Sorry.

20:22.500 --> 20:23.750
-Right.
-I also--

20:23.833 --> 20:25.625
Sorry. This is Lide.

20:25.708 --> 20:28.958
She's about four feet tall.
Has bangs, 8 years old…

20:29.041 --> 20:32.041
Do you have a piece of her clothing?

20:32.125 --> 20:34.625
An item for the search dogs?

20:35.333 --> 20:38.541
-Sure.
-I'll go get it, okay? Yeah?

20:39.916 --> 20:41.000
-Yeah.
-Okay.

20:41.083 --> 20:43.208
-It's okay.
-Get her pajamas.

20:43.291 --> 20:45.541
-All right.
-Unwashed, please.

20:45.625 --> 20:47.166
Her pajamas, Elena.

20:47.250 --> 20:50.500
We're expediting our procedures
due to the fire in the area.

20:50.583 --> 20:51.875
-Right.
-Yes.

20:51.958 --> 20:54.125
Units are on the way.
We'll join the search.

20:54.208 --> 20:59.666
She likely got turned around,
but she's probably close.

20:59.750 --> 21:04.291
-Thank you.
-We've activated our evacuation protocol.

21:04.375 --> 21:08.125
We need you
to leave this property and go home.

21:08.208 --> 21:11.208
Sure. As soon as my daughter is found,
we'll go.

21:11.291 --> 21:13.750
The fire is getting closer.
It's dangerous.

21:13.833 --> 21:15.875
That's why I can't leave without her--

21:15.958 --> 21:18.833
-We will keep you updated.
-Sir--

21:18.916 --> 21:22.125
But we need you to evacuate
as soon as possible.

21:22.208 --> 21:23.333
Excuse me, I--

21:23.416 --> 21:26.250
The roads will be closed
within the next few hours.

21:26.333 --> 21:29.583
I'm not evacuating
without my 8-year-old daughter.

21:29.666 --> 21:32.166
Ma'am, I understand your distress--

21:32.250 --> 21:35.083
-No, you don't.
-I do.

21:35.166 --> 21:36.583
You don't understand.

21:36.666 --> 21:39.541
I can't leave
without my 8-year-old daughter.

21:39.625 --> 21:41.833
-It's an order.
-All right. Let's--

21:41.916 --> 21:44.791
We have to follow protocol.
Given the circumstances--

21:44.875 --> 21:46.541
-We'll leave.
-What's your--

21:46.625 --> 21:48.291
-Sgt. Revuelta.
-Revuelta.

21:48.375 --> 21:51.750
-I'm sorry. Don't worry.
-You'll keep looking for her?

21:51.833 --> 21:53.250
-Evacuate the area.
-Yes.

21:53.333 --> 21:55.000
-Understood?
-Got it.

21:55.083 --> 21:57.875
We'll do everything we can
to find your daughter.

21:57.958 --> 21:59.583
It's "Lide." You got that?

21:59.666 --> 22:01.333
-Lide.
-We know.

22:01.416 --> 22:03.041
Anything I can do?

22:03.125 --> 22:05.458
You also need to evacuate.

22:05.541 --> 22:08.125
You know the area and the protocol.

22:08.208 --> 22:10.208
-Right.
-Someone will call you.

22:10.291 --> 22:12.333
Don't worry. She's just anxious.

22:12.416 --> 22:13.541
All right. Thank you.

22:13.625 --> 22:15.250
Okay. Thanks.

22:22.083 --> 22:23.916
Dani, go to Lide's room.

22:24.541 --> 22:25.750
I'll be right there.

22:26.375 --> 22:27.375
Don't worry.

22:27.458 --> 22:28.458
I'm not leaving.

22:29.083 --> 22:33.083
I don't care what they say.
I'm staying. You three go.

22:33.166 --> 22:34.958
Luis, there's a fire.

22:35.041 --> 22:37.458
Elena, it's dangerous.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.375
It's far away.
We can stay a little longer.

22:42.458 --> 22:43.666
It's okay. Really.

22:43.750 --> 22:45.708
-Elena, Luis, there's a fire.
-No.

22:45.791 --> 22:47.125
-It's okay.
-No. Mara.

22:47.708 --> 22:49.833
She'll show up. They'll find her.

22:49.916 --> 22:51.250
-Of course.
-It's fine.

22:51.333 --> 22:52.958
-You three go.
-No.

22:53.041 --> 22:54.125
They ordered us to--

22:54.208 --> 22:55.541
-We're staying.
-Yeah.

22:55.625 --> 22:57.208
We can't come back otherwise.

22:57.291 --> 22:59.333
-They're closing the roads.
-Really?

22:59.416 --> 23:01.791
The fire's still far away. We're staying.

23:01.875 --> 23:03.750
-We're staying.
-Yeah. With you.

23:03.833 --> 23:06.166
-Elena, are you sure?
-We're staying.

23:06.250 --> 23:07.791
-We're not leaving you.
-Yeah.

23:07.875 --> 23:09.833
-Thank you.
-We'll stick together.

23:10.916 --> 23:13.041
Come on! Go!

23:14.041 --> 23:16.291
Watch the line!

23:19.875 --> 23:21.875
-More pressure!
-Come on!

23:26.375 --> 23:30.333
Her name is Lide.
She's about four feet tall.

23:30.416 --> 23:34.625
Group One, you're with Revuelta.
Group Two, with Castro. Three, with me.

23:34.708 --> 23:36.791
Portillo, Group Four. Let's go!

23:37.291 --> 23:39.625
-Move!
-Let's go!

23:40.125 --> 23:41.333
Lide!

23:49.916 --> 23:50.916
Dani.

23:53.833 --> 23:55.916
I want to go look for her too.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.458
We can't, son.

23:57.541 --> 24:00.833
That's a job for the police.
We have to stay here.

24:00.916 --> 24:04.125
-Lide will find her way back.
-Are you sure?

24:04.208 --> 24:05.208
Yeah.

24:06.208 --> 24:07.750
I am. Just have faith.

24:08.791 --> 24:10.291
Lide!

24:10.375 --> 24:12.125
Check that area over there.

24:12.208 --> 24:14.208
Around the hut.

24:14.291 --> 24:15.625
Section one, clear.

24:24.500 --> 24:25.916
Lide, honey!

24:43.416 --> 24:45.083
Lide!

24:45.166 --> 24:47.916
There's too much smoke. The wind shifted.

24:50.333 --> 24:51.333
There!

24:51.416 --> 24:52.958
There's so much smoke.

24:53.541 --> 24:55.625
Smoke isn't fire.

24:55.708 --> 24:58.125
I'm keeping an eye on the fire.

24:58.208 --> 24:59.916
Look, it's really far away.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.291
They'll find Lide,
and we'll be home before you know it.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.541
-Lide!
-Let's go!

25:08.625 --> 25:10.833
Section one, clear. Moving west.

25:10.916 --> 25:13.458
-Visibility's terrible.
-Come on!

25:13.541 --> 25:15.125
The dogs can't keep going.

25:15.208 --> 25:18.916
We're waiting on HQ!
We'll keep you updated, okay?

25:34.708 --> 25:36.541
I shouldn't have yelled at her.

25:41.458 --> 25:44.500
I hate this house.
I hate this stupid forest.

25:48.750 --> 25:51.833
It wants to take everything from me. Why?

25:53.625 --> 25:58.083
That night Gus spent
in the woods alone changed him.

25:58.166 --> 26:01.750
He was never the same. He…

26:04.583 --> 26:06.208
-He gave up.
-No, Mara.

26:06.291 --> 26:08.208
-There was a treatment.
-No.

26:08.291 --> 26:10.125
There was a treatment.

26:10.625 --> 26:12.125
But he didn't even try.

26:12.208 --> 26:15.625
It was a trial.
He didn't want to be a guinea pig.

26:16.833 --> 26:17.833
That's your opinion.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.875
-And it was his.
-Honey.

26:20.958 --> 26:21.958
Damn it.

26:22.625 --> 26:25.416
If he were here,
he'd know exactly what to do.

26:31.333 --> 26:33.375
Hello?

26:33.458 --> 26:34.875
-Wha--
-Is it the police?

26:34.958 --> 26:38.750
Excuse-- Sorry. I can't hear you.
What was that?

26:44.625 --> 26:46.750
No.

26:46.833 --> 26:48.083
-What's up?
-Here.

26:48.625 --> 26:49.875
-What's wrong?
-Hello?

26:50.375 --> 26:52.791
Sorry, can you repeat that?
What did you say?

27:05.500 --> 27:06.958
That's ridiculous.

27:07.791 --> 27:08.833
Okay.

27:12.541 --> 27:14.916
-What is it?
-The conditions got worse.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.916
The wind changed direction,
so they're calling off the search.

27:19.000 --> 27:23.250
When conditions improve,
they'll head back out.

27:24.041 --> 27:26.250
That's it? That's all they said?

27:26.333 --> 27:30.041
They said we have to leave now.
That's what they're saying.

27:37.958 --> 27:41.708
We're going to look for her.
If they won't, we will.

27:41.791 --> 27:43.541
-Right.
-We'll find her.

27:43.625 --> 27:46.833
Right. I'm going to look for my daughter.

27:47.375 --> 27:50.166
Luis… it's dangerous.

27:50.750 --> 27:52.583
I'm keeping an eye on the fire.

27:53.083 --> 27:56.583
If it gets bad,
I'll come get you two, okay?

27:56.666 --> 27:59.333
-I should take Dani.
-No, honey…

27:59.416 --> 28:00.916
You'd leave us without a car.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.333
And if Lide shows up,
there'd be no one here waiting for her.

28:04.416 --> 28:08.333
Stay. If it gets bad,
I'll come back for you both.

28:09.916 --> 28:10.958
-Fine.
-Okay?

28:11.041 --> 28:12.625
-Okay.
-Don't worry.

28:12.708 --> 28:15.000
Luis, I'll go get Santi's car.

28:15.083 --> 28:18.916
I'll ask if we can borrow it.
Elena, call me if she comes back.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.208
-I will.
-Thank you.

28:21.333 --> 28:23.541
-When Lide's back, we all leave.
-Okay.

28:30.125 --> 28:31.125
Santi?

28:35.333 --> 28:36.333
Santiago?

28:40.708 --> 28:41.875
Santiago?

28:44.708 --> 28:46.750
-Yeah?
-Santiago?

28:46.833 --> 28:48.375
-What's up?
-It's Mara.

28:48.458 --> 28:49.500
-Excuse me.
-Hi.

28:49.583 --> 28:52.041
Listen, the police called off the search.

28:52.125 --> 28:53.583
I just heard it on the radio.

28:53.666 --> 28:56.833
Can we borrow your car
to look for her in the woods?

28:56.916 --> 28:59.666
-Ours isn't--
-Of course.

28:59.750 --> 29:01.125
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

29:01.208 --> 29:02.625
I'll come with you.

29:02.708 --> 29:05.458
-You don't have to.
-No, I'm coming.

29:05.541 --> 29:07.625
-The more, the better.
-Let's go.

29:12.208 --> 29:13.375
Wait.

29:18.208 --> 29:19.208
This one…

29:19.958 --> 29:21.833
-Santiago?
-Yeah?

29:23.250 --> 29:25.416
Mind if I check your place?

29:27.166 --> 29:31.083
-That's a bit…
-I just thought maybe…

29:31.166 --> 29:33.833
Maybe she's hiding in there, you know?

29:33.916 --> 29:35.708
And not in the woods…

29:36.416 --> 29:38.458
I would've seen her.

29:39.083 --> 29:41.083
Maybe you missed her.

29:41.791 --> 29:46.250
I'd feel better
if I could just take a quick look.

29:46.333 --> 29:48.583
-She was upset with me--
-Yeah, sure.

29:48.666 --> 29:49.958
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

29:50.041 --> 29:51.458
-I'm sorry.
-Come in.

29:52.666 --> 29:53.958
-Thank you.
-Excuse me.

29:54.041 --> 29:57.458
It's fine.
Anyway, this is the living room.

30:05.458 --> 30:07.833
-Sorry. I…
-No, it's okay.

30:08.791 --> 30:10.916
-If you don't mind checking…
-Sure.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.625
-Sorry, I just…
-Let's see.

30:19.541 --> 30:20.833
I'm sorry.

30:21.916 --> 30:24.250
-That's the bathroom.
-May I?

30:24.333 --> 30:26.333
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

30:36.625 --> 30:38.166
Here's the radio for…

30:38.250 --> 30:40.375
-I was listening to…
-Right.

30:45.291 --> 30:46.625
Can I check in there?

30:48.458 --> 30:50.250
I'd rather you didn't.

30:53.958 --> 30:56.250
Why? It'll only take a second.

30:56.333 --> 30:58.000
She's definitely not in there.

30:58.083 --> 31:01.250
This is part of my…
No, I'd rather you didn't. Not in there.

31:14.458 --> 31:15.708
What's this?

31:16.333 --> 31:18.791
That's…

31:18.875 --> 31:21.041
-Mushrooms, it's--
-Drugs?

31:21.125 --> 31:24.166
No, psilocybin. Psilocybin.

31:24.250 --> 31:27.125
-It's more like… medicine.
-For what?

31:27.208 --> 31:31.416
Stuff conventional medicine can't treat.
I use it to make…

31:32.583 --> 31:33.791
It helps a lot.

31:34.958 --> 31:36.375
Why are you still here?

31:42.958 --> 31:44.083
I don't know.

31:44.583 --> 31:46.125
I've got nowhere else to go.

31:54.250 --> 31:57.583
I'm sure Lide's in the woods.

31:57.666 --> 31:58.791
Luis.

32:02.666 --> 32:03.666
Luis.

32:09.625 --> 32:11.708
I think the firebreak will work.

32:15.500 --> 32:16.541
What's wrong?

32:18.458 --> 32:19.458
What is it?

32:21.125 --> 32:22.458
What's wrong?

32:22.541 --> 32:24.500
-Something's off.
-What?

32:24.583 --> 32:26.000
-He…
-What?

32:26.916 --> 32:29.625
-What's wrong?
-Something's not right. Luis!

32:30.875 --> 32:33.583
-Why wouldn't he let me in?
-Where?

32:34.166 --> 32:39.250
There's a room he wouldn't let us check.
And he was nervous. You could tell.

32:39.333 --> 32:42.333
-It's just weird.
-Think about it.

32:42.416 --> 32:46.166
He saw Lide, there's a fire,
and he didn't bring her home?

32:46.250 --> 32:48.625
Maybe he didn't know about the fire.

32:48.708 --> 32:51.083
-No.
-Okay, let's think.

32:51.166 --> 32:53.708
-I'm calling the police.
-There's no signal.

32:54.708 --> 32:56.041
No internet either.

32:57.541 --> 33:00.375
-Is it just your phone?
-No, there's no signal.

33:00.458 --> 33:02.041
-And yours?
-Since when?

33:02.125 --> 33:03.791
Like five minutes ago.

33:03.875 --> 33:07.666
Let's go back to his place
and get him to let us in.

33:07.750 --> 33:09.166
Why won't it go through?

33:09.875 --> 33:13.458
-It's not working.
-What's he up to? Is he leaving?

33:13.541 --> 33:15.125
He's leaving.

33:15.750 --> 33:17.916
-Santiago!
-Keep trying, okay?

33:18.000 --> 33:19.500
I will, but we're cut off.

33:19.583 --> 33:20.583
-Santi!
-Yeah?

33:20.666 --> 33:22.625
Wait. Santi.

33:23.791 --> 33:25.166
-Wait up.
-Yeah.

33:25.250 --> 33:27.166
-Where are you going?
-Well, I'm…

33:27.250 --> 33:29.875
-Huh?
-To get Lide.

33:29.958 --> 33:31.458
Do you know where she is?

33:32.125 --> 33:34.166
I'm guessing she's in the woods.

33:36.208 --> 33:38.083
Get in if you want. Let's--

33:38.166 --> 33:39.583
-We're coming.
-Sure.

33:39.666 --> 33:42.750
-She's probably in the woods.
-We're coming with you.

33:44.208 --> 33:45.791
Come on, Mara. Get in.

33:51.833 --> 33:54.083
-Are there still bears?
-Excuse me?

33:54.166 --> 33:57.291
-Are there bears in the woods?
-No, that map's old.

33:57.375 --> 33:58.708
No bears.

33:58.791 --> 34:01.041
-Ah, wait.
-What is it?

34:01.125 --> 34:05.125
It's getting dark.
You'll need flashlights.

34:05.208 --> 34:07.250
-I'll be right back.
-I'm coming.

34:07.333 --> 34:09.625
No, you stay.

34:09.708 --> 34:10.958
The key.

34:31.625 --> 34:32.958
Stay calm.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.625
Isn't this Lide's bracelet?

34:55.208 --> 34:56.750
See? That was quick.

34:56.833 --> 34:59.541
It's really important. If it gets dark…

34:59.625 --> 35:00.875
One for you, Luis.

35:01.458 --> 35:02.833
One for you, Mara.

35:03.708 --> 35:06.583
Finding her will only get harder.

35:06.666 --> 35:09.375
-We're wasting time--
-Wait. Turn it off.

35:09.458 --> 35:11.833
-Why?
-Turn off the engine.

35:11.916 --> 35:12.958
Turn it off.

35:14.041 --> 35:15.041
Sorry?

35:17.916 --> 35:18.916
Give me the keys.

35:19.583 --> 35:20.666
What's wrong?

35:23.625 --> 35:27.375
What's this? "Isolated area," "safe area"…

35:27.458 --> 35:28.875
What's this map for?

35:28.958 --> 35:31.541
They're notes for…

35:32.041 --> 35:35.208
Remember what I said earlier
about psilocybin?

35:35.291 --> 35:38.541
Besides my job
with the Department of Environment,

35:38.625 --> 35:43.875
I also do rituals in secluded areas.

35:49.708 --> 35:51.625
Santiago, where's my daughter?

35:52.416 --> 35:54.333
-It was in here.
-Right.

35:54.416 --> 35:56.916
She gave it to me earlier at the hut.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.416
No. That's a lie.

35:58.500 --> 35:59.916
She never takes it off.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.875
Never. I gave it to her.

36:02.958 --> 36:05.541
-There's no way she gave it to you.
-God.

36:05.625 --> 36:09.833
I want to check your place again.
Give me the keys.

36:09.916 --> 36:11.875
-Hey!
-Give me your house keys!

36:11.958 --> 36:13.000
Give them to her.

36:13.083 --> 36:14.458
-Hand them over!
-Do it.

36:14.541 --> 36:17.333
-I will.
-Let her check. Do it.

36:19.166 --> 36:20.958
To hell with the keys!

36:23.083 --> 36:25.125
-Lide!
-Mara!

36:25.708 --> 36:28.000
-Don't come any closer.
-Please.

36:28.083 --> 36:30.875
Open up! Lide!

36:30.958 --> 36:33.416
Stay right there. Give me the keys.

36:33.500 --> 36:35.583
-Lide!
-Luis…

36:35.666 --> 36:36.666
Lide!

36:39.500 --> 36:40.541
The keys. Now.

36:40.625 --> 36:42.083
No! Stop!

36:44.000 --> 36:46.500
-Just let her check.
-Lide!

36:51.166 --> 36:52.083
Come on, Luis.

36:55.500 --> 36:57.250
No funny stuff!

37:02.166 --> 37:03.166
I'm watching you.

37:08.708 --> 37:10.958
Mara!

37:12.750 --> 37:14.000
Open the door, Santiago!

37:14.083 --> 37:16.041
Mara.

37:16.125 --> 37:17.708
-Do what she says.
-Right.

37:17.791 --> 37:19.875
-Open it!
-Lide's not in here.

37:19.958 --> 37:22.708
-Open the door, Santiago.
-Lide's in the woods.

37:23.208 --> 37:26.625
-Do what she says. Open it.
-Okay, I'll--

37:26.708 --> 37:29.208
-Open the fucking door!
-Okay.

37:29.291 --> 37:31.500
-Do what she says.
-I'll open it.

37:54.375 --> 37:55.541
What is this?

37:57.208 --> 37:58.375
What's all this?

37:58.458 --> 38:00.125
-Your daughter isn't here.
-What…

38:01.916 --> 38:03.041
What the…?

38:07.833 --> 38:09.750
What's all this? Who are you?

38:11.083 --> 38:12.416
It's…

38:13.416 --> 38:14.625
What is it?

38:15.916 --> 38:19.000
-What's all this shit?
-It's…

38:29.333 --> 38:30.333
Where's Lide?

38:45.916 --> 38:48.583
What's in there? What's that room?

38:48.666 --> 38:50.583
Look, it's my meditation space.

38:50.666 --> 38:51.916
-No.
-Lide!

38:52.000 --> 38:53.125
This damn door.

38:53.208 --> 38:55.208
Open this one too.

38:55.291 --> 38:56.791
Now, Santiago!

38:56.875 --> 38:58.208
Do what she says.

38:58.291 --> 38:59.458
-Please.
-Fine.

38:59.541 --> 39:01.041
-Open it.
-Fine. There.

39:20.458 --> 39:21.458
Go in.

39:22.208 --> 39:23.291
Go ahead.

39:44.375 --> 39:45.458
See?

39:46.041 --> 39:48.166
She's not here. Like I told you.

39:48.250 --> 39:50.125
-Where's my daughter?
-She's not here.

39:50.875 --> 39:54.666
I didn't do anything to her, Mara.
She got lost in the woods.

39:54.750 --> 39:57.750
-I called the police.
-Good, Mara!

39:57.833 --> 40:00.375
Because I didn't touch her.

40:01.125 --> 40:02.583
-Where is she?
-I don't know.

40:03.375 --> 40:04.500
I don't know, Mara.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.958
In the woods or…

40:09.625 --> 40:12.125
Please tell me where she is.

40:12.208 --> 40:13.250
I don't know.

40:13.333 --> 40:16.291
-Mara.
-I'm begging you. Please.

40:16.375 --> 40:19.291
-Mara, listen.
-No. Where is she?

40:19.375 --> 40:21.666
-I didn't do anything.
-Don't touch her.

40:21.750 --> 40:23.083
No, don't you touch her.

40:23.166 --> 40:25.333
-Don't.
-Okay.

40:26.083 --> 40:27.541
Where's my niece?

40:27.625 --> 40:31.166
You had her bracelet.
You left her alone in the woods.

40:31.250 --> 40:33.458
During a fire. Are we the bad guys here?

40:33.541 --> 40:34.875
-I'm sorry.
-Where is she?

40:34.958 --> 40:36.750
-What's this?
-Huh?

40:37.291 --> 40:38.208
Huh?

40:40.000 --> 40:42.500
-That's for my rituals.
-What rituals?

40:42.583 --> 40:44.500
My rituals. If you'd just listen--

40:44.583 --> 40:47.333
-I don't believe you.
-Let me speak. Luis. Mara.

40:47.416 --> 40:48.833
You're not leaving.

40:52.166 --> 40:54.041
Stop!

40:54.125 --> 40:56.791
-Grab him!
-Luis!

40:56.875 --> 40:59.333
We're not stopping
until you tell us where she is.

40:59.416 --> 41:01.000
Luis, tie him up.

41:01.083 --> 41:03.166
I didn't do anything!

41:03.250 --> 41:05.000
-Come here.
-Please, Luis!

41:06.125 --> 41:08.666
You left a kid out there in the woods?

41:08.750 --> 41:10.416
You just walked away?

41:10.500 --> 41:13.291
Now you expect me
to believe your "ritual" bullshit?

41:13.375 --> 41:15.041
-Here.
-Luis!

41:18.375 --> 41:20.666
You think I won't? Where's my niece?

41:21.208 --> 41:22.250
Get up.

41:23.666 --> 41:26.416
Now you're gonna talk.

41:28.708 --> 41:30.916
Tie him to the chair.

41:32.625 --> 41:34.250
-Can you…?
-Where is she?

41:34.333 --> 41:35.875
-I don't know.
-Please.

41:35.958 --> 41:37.166
Mara, I don't know.

41:37.250 --> 41:38.750
Where'd you last see her?

41:38.833 --> 41:41.333
-At the hut.
-Then why isn't she there?

41:41.416 --> 41:44.333
-Because she got lost.
-Lies. She wouldn't.

41:44.416 --> 41:47.333
She's been coming here her whole life.
She wouldn't.

41:47.416 --> 41:49.000
Where's my daughter?

41:49.083 --> 41:50.333
Luis…

41:50.416 --> 41:53.291
Please. Do something. Make him talk.

41:59.250 --> 42:00.500
What is all this?

42:02.166 --> 42:03.375
What is this?

42:03.875 --> 42:05.125
What's all this for?

42:06.000 --> 42:08.500
What the hell is this?

42:09.375 --> 42:10.416
Talk!

42:10.500 --> 42:13.125
-Where's my daughter?
-I said I don't know.

42:15.791 --> 42:18.458
Where's my niece? You saw her at the hut.

42:18.541 --> 42:22.708
You kept her bracelet.
What did you do to her? Where is she?

42:23.625 --> 42:24.875
Where is she?!

42:28.375 --> 42:30.583
Talk! I'll make you talk.

42:30.666 --> 42:32.625
Where is she?

42:33.958 --> 42:36.333
-Luis.
-Where's my niece? Where?

42:36.416 --> 42:41.166
Why did you leave an 8-year-old
alone in the woods during a wildfire?

42:41.791 --> 42:42.916
Talk!

42:44.041 --> 42:45.041
Luis!

42:52.708 --> 42:54.125
What are we doing?

42:54.208 --> 42:56.375
-What?
-What are we doing?

42:56.458 --> 42:58.333
Getting him to tell us where Lide is.

42:58.416 --> 43:00.291
No, we need to call the police.

43:02.833 --> 43:05.625
Fuck. It's not working.

43:05.708 --> 43:08.791
-What?
-There's no signal.

43:12.625 --> 43:14.833
Mine isn't working either. Wait.

43:16.041 --> 43:17.250
I'll grab his phone.

43:19.500 --> 43:20.958
Luis.

43:21.041 --> 43:22.250
Don't move.

43:25.250 --> 43:26.375
The PIN.

43:27.666 --> 43:29.916
-What's the PIN?
-I'm not telling you.

43:31.375 --> 43:32.791
There's a fire.

43:32.875 --> 43:35.416
Stop screwing around and give me the PIN.

43:37.416 --> 43:39.250
What's the damn PIN?!

43:41.416 --> 43:43.375
The PIN, you son of a bitch!

43:43.875 --> 43:46.875
You gonna tell me or not?

43:46.958 --> 43:48.625
What's the PIN?

43:50.083 --> 43:51.625
-One…
-One, nine, eight…

43:51.708 --> 43:53.000
Nine, eight, eight?

43:54.333 --> 43:55.416
Mara!

43:56.875 --> 43:58.000
Mara!

43:58.583 --> 44:00.000
No. Stop.

44:00.083 --> 44:01.083
What?

44:06.291 --> 44:07.666
I wasn't hurting him.

44:08.250 --> 44:10.791
I swear. Mara.

44:11.375 --> 44:16.041
I won't hurt him. It's just to scare him
into telling us where Lide is.

44:16.125 --> 44:17.750
This asshole's lying.

44:18.625 --> 44:20.375
-I'll stop if you want.
-Yes.

44:20.458 --> 44:22.458
I'll stop if you want.

44:22.541 --> 44:24.458
-Yes.
-I'll stop, okay?

44:24.541 --> 44:25.416
I'll stop.

44:26.500 --> 44:27.500
Stop.

44:28.041 --> 44:29.791
We need to talk to the police.

44:29.875 --> 44:31.500
There's no signal here either.

44:34.583 --> 44:35.583
The radio.

44:35.666 --> 44:36.916
-The radio.
-The radio.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
Right.

44:46.125 --> 44:47.208
-What?
-It won't work.

44:47.291 --> 44:49.791
-It's not working?
-I can't use it.

44:49.875 --> 44:52.083
Here. The battery's down here.

44:55.166 --> 44:56.791
-Hello?
-Hello?

44:58.125 --> 44:59.958
-Hello?
-Hello! Wait.

45:02.250 --> 45:04.750
Can anyone hear me? Hello? Please.

45:06.666 --> 45:07.916
Yes, I'm--

45:08.000 --> 45:11.958
Hello, we're in the woods.
In the ranger's house.

45:12.041 --> 45:13.208
Can anyone hear me?

45:15.041 --> 45:17.166
It's dying. Low battery.

45:19.291 --> 45:20.666
-Do you copy?
-Hello?

45:20.750 --> 45:23.375
I'm the missing girl's mother.

45:23.458 --> 45:25.625
We need the police. Please!

45:26.666 --> 45:28.333
Hello?

45:41.125 --> 45:42.125
Luis.

45:43.000 --> 45:44.000
Luis.

45:46.458 --> 45:48.125
What if he did something to her?

45:52.083 --> 45:53.541
What if he did something?

45:55.916 --> 45:57.750
If I lose her, I'll die.

45:58.333 --> 45:59.833
That's not going to happen.

45:59.916 --> 46:01.208
It won't.

46:01.291 --> 46:04.125
We'll search every room.
Every corner. Every closet.

46:04.208 --> 46:06.791
Let's look. We'll find her.

46:08.041 --> 46:10.375
-We'll find her.
-Right. Okay.

46:11.791 --> 46:13.541
We need clues.

46:13.625 --> 46:15.958
-Right.
-There has to be something.

46:16.041 --> 46:17.875
Something that leads us to her.

46:18.500 --> 46:20.000
There has to be something.

46:31.500 --> 46:33.541
PITS AS SACRED SPACES

46:47.333 --> 46:50.625
MESSAGES
SPRING

46:53.291 --> 46:54.250
THAT WAS AMAZING.

46:54.333 --> 46:57.458
NEVER BEEN SO SCARED AND FELT
SUCH A RUSH AT THE SAME TIME.

47:01.416 --> 47:03.250
YOU'RE NOT GETTING RID OF ME.

47:03.333 --> 47:06.291
EVERYONE WILL FIND OUT,
AND YOU'LL GO TO PRISON.

47:11.916 --> 47:13.125
PHOTOS

48:45.500 --> 48:46.541
Mara.

48:47.583 --> 48:49.250
Can you listen, please?

48:49.333 --> 48:51.666
Why are you suspicious of me?

48:52.583 --> 48:53.583
What is it?

48:54.625 --> 48:55.708
The shovel?

48:56.500 --> 48:58.750
Your daughter was alone in the woods.

48:58.833 --> 49:00.291
-I was--
-Shut up.

49:00.375 --> 49:02.916
And about the bracelet, Mara…

49:03.416 --> 49:05.083
-It was on the ground.
-Mara!

49:08.583 --> 49:09.583
Mara.

49:10.875 --> 49:12.291
Don't let him go.

49:12.916 --> 49:14.291
Check the rope.

49:14.375 --> 49:15.458
You're not listening.

49:15.541 --> 49:17.125
-Shut up.
-You're not listening.

49:17.208 --> 49:19.000
Watch him. I'll check outside.

49:19.083 --> 49:20.833
You didn't let me explain.

49:55.500 --> 49:56.833
Where's my daughter?

49:59.708 --> 50:01.208
I don't know.

50:03.625 --> 50:05.833
She can't just disappear.

50:06.750 --> 50:08.625
Listen, I…

50:10.000 --> 50:13.791
I was in the car,
and I saw Lide in the hut, okay?

50:14.875 --> 50:19.000
At first, I tried to get her
to come home with me.

50:19.083 --> 50:22.666
But she seemed fine,
like she needed to be alone because…

50:24.708 --> 50:28.625
So I left. And I'm really sorry.

50:28.708 --> 50:31.833
She's been alone for a long time now.

50:33.583 --> 50:35.708
She's probably terrified.

50:36.458 --> 50:39.708
I'm sorry, Mara. I'm truly sorry.

50:39.791 --> 50:42.625
I should've insisted and brought her back.

50:42.708 --> 50:45.541
That's where I messed up. But that's it.

50:45.625 --> 50:47.333
I didn't do anything--

50:47.416 --> 50:49.250
I don't believe a word you say.

50:50.666 --> 50:53.000
I thought she'd be okay.

50:53.500 --> 50:54.875
Where's my daughter?

50:55.375 --> 50:58.250
I swear, I don't know. I'm so sorry, Mara.

50:58.333 --> 51:02.000
Where… is my daughter?

51:02.083 --> 51:03.416
In the woods.

51:03.500 --> 51:07.208
-Where is my daughter? Again.
-In the woods.

51:07.291 --> 51:09.291
-Where is my daughter?
-In the--

51:09.375 --> 51:12.250
Again! Where is my daughter?

51:12.333 --> 51:14.083
Where is my daughter?

51:16.083 --> 51:17.666
-Where?
-In the forest-

51:17.750 --> 51:21.000
Tell me! You should've brought her back!

51:21.083 --> 51:23.083
If she's hurt, I'll kill you. I swear.

51:23.166 --> 51:25.000
I could kill you right now.

51:27.666 --> 51:29.666
Forgive me.

51:43.416 --> 51:44.541
Luis?

51:46.250 --> 51:47.416
What are you doing?

51:48.291 --> 51:49.375
Look.

51:50.583 --> 51:53.291
-Look.
-What is it?

51:53.375 --> 51:55.625
-It's his phone.
-What?

51:55.708 --> 51:56.791
This bastard.

52:06.625 --> 52:08.916
-I know what you're going through.
-You can't.

52:09.000 --> 52:12.416
I know how you're feeling. I really do.

52:12.500 --> 52:15.833
Don't talk to me like that. Who are you?

52:15.916 --> 52:17.000
Stop it!

52:17.500 --> 52:19.250
I would never hurt a child.

52:19.333 --> 52:22.666
I'd never lay a finger on a child. Never.

52:24.958 --> 52:26.625
Here. Record it.

52:28.750 --> 52:30.625
You have to come here already.

52:30.708 --> 52:34.083
I haven't seen you all weekend!

52:34.166 --> 52:35.791
I want to be in it too.

52:35.875 --> 52:38.125
Come on. Let me.

52:39.375 --> 52:42.458
I also want you here.
We miss you so much, baby.

52:42.541 --> 52:44.833
-All right?
-Tell me, will I see her again?

52:44.916 --> 52:47.250
Just tell me if I'll see her again.

52:48.375 --> 52:53.291
I get that all of this
makes you suspicious of me.

52:53.916 --> 52:56.416
This is just a big misunderstanding.

52:57.000 --> 52:58.250
The map, the psilocybin.

52:58.333 --> 53:00.875
Yes, this is what I do. I help people.

53:02.291 --> 53:05.166
I do rituals with psilocybin

53:05.250 --> 53:08.875
to help people
leave their old life behind.

53:09.583 --> 53:11.750
To connect to something new.

53:14.291 --> 53:15.958
To stop being afraid of death.

53:34.458 --> 53:36.625
THE USE OF PSILOCYBIN IN TERMINAL ILLNESS

53:36.708 --> 53:40.000
REDUCING ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION
IN TERMINAL PATIENTS

53:48.416 --> 53:51.958
That night Gustavo spent in the woods…

53:55.625 --> 53:57.416
He didn't want me there.

54:00.708 --> 54:03.250
You were with him, weren't you?

54:07.958 --> 54:09.666
-Yes.
-Weren't you?

54:13.416 --> 54:14.791
What did you do to him?

54:16.708 --> 54:18.166
Nothing bad.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.958
You should've seen him.

54:23.041 --> 54:25.541
-What?
-It was what he wanted.

54:27.750 --> 54:29.458
He found peace, Mara.

54:30.625 --> 54:31.625
He found peace.

54:31.708 --> 54:32.833
Bastard.

54:32.916 --> 54:35.250
He found peace, Mara.

54:57.916 --> 55:00.416
No.

55:00.500 --> 55:01.500
Elena…

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
Mara…

55:08.833 --> 55:10.458
No, let me.

55:10.958 --> 55:12.708
-Please.
-No.

55:12.791 --> 55:13.875
Let me do it.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.250
-Let me.
-Mara!

55:18.333 --> 55:20.083
-Mara.
-No!

55:20.166 --> 55:23.666
No! Please! Let me!

55:23.750 --> 55:25.291
I'll do it.

55:26.333 --> 55:27.333
No.

55:27.416 --> 55:31.250
-No, please!
-Let me do it!

55:36.000 --> 55:37.125
No…

55:43.250 --> 55:45.250
It's not her.

56:01.750 --> 56:03.916
You son of a bitch!

56:10.458 --> 56:13.083
This piece of shit is messing with us!

56:18.375 --> 56:19.375
Luis.

56:21.875 --> 56:23.375
Where's the neighbor?

56:23.458 --> 56:24.625
Inside.

56:25.666 --> 56:27.375
-Tied up.
-What?

57:48.750 --> 57:50.208
Hi, Jorge.

57:50.833 --> 57:55.291
Look, I just dug the pit
for your rebirth ritual.

57:55.375 --> 58:00.250
I've got a few,
but I dug this one far from the house.

58:00.333 --> 58:03.708
I think the energy's perfect for you, and…

58:04.208 --> 58:06.666
Yeah. I'll show you.

58:14.083 --> 58:16.833
Anyway, see you.

59:28.541 --> 59:29.833
Hi, Lide.

59:32.708 --> 59:33.750
Are you okay?

59:35.958 --> 59:38.166
There's smoke. There's a fire nearby.

59:38.250 --> 59:39.208
Can you smell it?

59:41.125 --> 59:43.083
-Are you out here by yourself?
-Yes.

59:44.750 --> 59:46.375
Why are you all alone?

59:47.583 --> 59:51.958
I was leaving some of my dad's things.
Want to see?

59:56.041 --> 59:57.416
-What is it?
-Pictures.

01:00:05.625 --> 01:00:06.750
They're beautiful.

01:00:09.291 --> 01:00:11.500
My mom wanted to throw them away.

01:00:11.583 --> 01:00:13.041
I knew him.

01:00:13.625 --> 01:00:14.583
Really?

01:00:15.875 --> 01:00:18.291
I tried to help him when he was sick.

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:23.333
-To cure him?
-To stop him being afraid.

01:00:25.708 --> 01:00:26.708
Afraid?

01:00:28.208 --> 01:00:29.208
Of what?

01:00:31.416 --> 01:00:33.166
Of being away from you two.

01:00:36.208 --> 01:00:37.666
Mom said

01:00:38.666 --> 01:00:42.250
Dad didn't want to get better.

01:00:42.333 --> 01:00:45.958
-I heard her tell my aunt.
-He did want to.

01:00:46.041 --> 01:00:48.166
He couldn't, Lide.

01:00:48.250 --> 01:00:50.583
-He couldn't.
-Right?

01:00:51.208 --> 01:00:53.458
-Yeah.
-I think so too.

01:00:53.541 --> 01:00:56.625
Your mom will understand someday.
She just…

01:00:57.458 --> 01:00:59.125
She needs more time.

01:01:08.291 --> 01:01:09.541
What's this bracelet?

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.250
Is it yours?

01:01:17.333 --> 01:01:21.083
Yeah, but I don't want it anymore.
My mom gave it to me.

01:01:24.541 --> 01:01:27.416
-What should we do?
-You can have it.

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:29.000
-No, it's--
-It's yours.

01:01:30.166 --> 01:01:32.833
-You keep it.
-Are you sure?

01:01:32.916 --> 01:01:34.500
-I'm sure.
-Look.

01:01:34.583 --> 01:01:37.625
-You won't tell anyone?
-Of course not.

01:01:37.708 --> 01:01:41.291
I'll say I lost it.
Or that a bear stole it.

01:01:43.458 --> 01:01:44.833
You promise?

01:01:47.416 --> 01:01:48.625
Promise.

01:01:50.833 --> 01:01:53.208
Want me to drive you home?

01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:58.041
-No.
-No?

01:01:58.625 --> 01:02:00.666
I want to say goodbye to the hut.

01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:06.416
You'll head home
as soon as you're done here?

01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:08.833
-Okay.
-Promise?

01:02:10.125 --> 01:02:11.250
Do this.

01:02:15.166 --> 01:02:16.375
All right.

01:02:18.458 --> 01:02:19.916
Bye, Lide.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.041
Bye.

01:03:46.833 --> 01:03:49.000
No…

01:03:49.083 --> 01:03:50.125
That's not okay.

01:03:50.208 --> 01:03:51.958
You've lost your minds.

01:03:52.791 --> 01:03:54.083
He's lying.

01:03:55.291 --> 01:03:56.541
He's lying to us.

01:04:13.208 --> 01:04:14.458
What if you're wrong?

01:04:14.541 --> 01:04:15.791
-No.
-Yes.

01:04:15.875 --> 01:04:18.375
We need to make him tell us where Lide is.

01:04:18.458 --> 01:04:19.833
-No, honey.
-Yes.

01:04:19.916 --> 01:04:23.958
We need to leave, okay?
Call the police and get out of here.

01:04:43.916 --> 01:04:45.083
Hey, Dani.

01:04:48.125 --> 01:04:49.125
Dani.

01:04:50.875 --> 01:04:53.125
Can you untie me, please?

01:04:56.333 --> 01:04:59.875
Let's go look for your cousin together.

01:04:59.958 --> 01:05:01.875
Please. Untie me.

01:05:02.583 --> 01:05:03.583
Dani…

01:05:05.625 --> 01:05:06.625
Your…

01:05:07.625 --> 01:05:08.958
Your father and…

01:05:09.041 --> 01:05:11.458
and your… your aunt and your mom

01:05:11.541 --> 01:05:14.708
will go to jail if you don't untie me.

01:05:18.041 --> 01:05:20.375
-They did this to you?
-Yes.

01:05:21.166 --> 01:05:24.791
Yes, but they're confused.
They've got the wrong…

01:05:25.416 --> 01:05:29.375
They've got the wrong person.
They think I'm someone else.

01:05:30.291 --> 01:05:34.250
Someone different.
But… I didn't do anything wrong.

01:05:37.291 --> 01:05:39.375
Then why didn't you tell them?

01:05:39.458 --> 01:05:42.541
I tried, but your father won't…

01:05:43.375 --> 01:05:44.500
He won't listen.

01:05:45.541 --> 01:05:46.750
He just yells.

01:05:51.791 --> 01:05:54.541
Honestly, I'm scared.

01:05:56.583 --> 01:05:58.416
This is all my fault.

01:05:59.708 --> 01:06:03.000
I told Lide she was annoying, so she left.

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:04.666
It's not your fault.

01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:10.125
Look, untie me,
and we'll go… find your cousin together.

01:06:10.208 --> 01:06:13.041
I know this forest
like the back of my hand.

01:06:14.166 --> 01:06:16.666
Please, Dani.

01:06:18.333 --> 01:06:19.541
We have to go.

01:06:19.625 --> 01:06:20.708
-No.
-Yes.

01:06:20.791 --> 01:06:23.291
We need to push him
until he tells the truth.

01:06:23.375 --> 01:06:24.958
"Push him"?

01:06:25.041 --> 01:06:27.500
What if he's telling the truth?

01:06:28.708 --> 01:06:30.833
Maybe you two are wrong.

01:06:30.916 --> 01:06:34.583
He was with Gus that night in the woods.

01:06:34.666 --> 01:06:36.708
-What?
-Santi was there.

01:06:36.791 --> 01:06:38.333
-With my brother?
-Luis…

01:06:39.416 --> 01:06:40.375
My brother?

01:06:40.458 --> 01:06:41.708
Luis…

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.750
Dani, let's figure this out.
Just you and me.

01:06:49.916 --> 01:06:50.958
Thank you, Dani.

01:06:51.041 --> 01:06:53.416
-Call the police. Take Dani.
-No.

01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:55.583
-I'll keep going.
-No. Please.

01:06:55.666 --> 01:06:57.333
-Take Dani.
-No. Come with us!

01:06:57.416 --> 01:06:59.000
Come with us! There's a fire!

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.500
Thank you.

01:07:10.791 --> 01:07:11.791
Dani!

01:07:13.041 --> 01:07:15.833
Dani, where are you? Dani!

01:07:20.375 --> 01:07:21.958
Thank you.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.333
Open up!

01:07:29.125 --> 01:07:30.625
Open this damn door!

01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:34.416
The kid's with me! Open up!

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:37.083
-Open it!
-What?

01:07:37.708 --> 01:07:39.416
Mara, let me out!

01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:42.333
-Dani?
-Open the door!

01:07:43.416 --> 01:07:45.125
-He was getting away.
-What?

01:07:45.208 --> 01:07:48.416
I'll make him talk.
We have to pressure him.

01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:50.083
-Open up!
-Make him talk.

01:07:51.541 --> 01:07:53.583
Open this fucking door! Luis!

01:07:53.666 --> 01:07:55.458
You're not coming out!

01:07:55.541 --> 01:07:57.541
I'll keep pushing until he talks.

01:07:57.625 --> 01:07:59.250
He will. You'll see.

01:07:59.333 --> 01:08:00.541
Dad!

01:08:02.583 --> 01:08:04.291
-Son?
-Luis, the kid's here!

01:08:04.375 --> 01:08:05.625
-Dani?
-Open the door!

01:08:05.708 --> 01:08:08.083
What? Dani…

01:08:08.166 --> 01:08:10.083
Why's my son in there? Dani!

01:08:10.166 --> 01:08:12.000
I've got your son!

01:08:12.083 --> 01:08:14.000
-Why's Dani in there?
-Santi.

01:08:14.083 --> 01:08:15.791
-Dani!
-Dad, stop yelling.

01:08:15.875 --> 01:08:17.916
-What?
-Stop yelling, he says!

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.333
Why are you in there?
Dani! Son! Are you okay?

01:08:21.416 --> 01:08:22.666
I'm in here, Dad.

01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:25.458
Stay calm. Stay calm, son.

01:08:25.541 --> 01:08:27.041
Stay away from him.

01:08:27.125 --> 01:08:28.291
-Give me the keys.
-No.

01:08:28.375 --> 01:08:31.125
-What?
-I have your son, Luis. Open up.

01:08:31.208 --> 01:08:33.208
-Give me the key.
-He won't hurt him.

01:08:33.291 --> 01:08:35.666
-Give me the key.
-He won't hurt him.

01:08:35.750 --> 01:08:37.333
Luis!

01:08:37.416 --> 01:08:38.833
Give me the key.

01:08:38.916 --> 01:08:39.958
No!

01:08:41.708 --> 01:08:43.458
I need to know where she is.

01:08:43.541 --> 01:08:46.083
You locked my son
in there with that bastard.

01:08:46.166 --> 01:08:48.291
-Give them to me.
-He won't hurt him.

01:08:48.375 --> 01:08:50.958
I need him to tell me
where my daughter is!

01:08:51.041 --> 01:08:53.416
-Are you insane?
-Open up, or I'll hurt him!

01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:54.875
Open up!

01:08:54.958 --> 01:08:56.416
I'm opening the door!

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:59.125
If you hurt my son, I swear I'll kill you.

01:08:59.875 --> 01:09:03.083
-Luis, look.
-Listen. Don't hurt him.

01:09:03.166 --> 01:09:04.291
Take me. Leave him.

01:09:04.375 --> 01:09:05.458
-No.
-Take me.

01:09:05.541 --> 01:09:06.875
Luis, look.

01:09:06.958 --> 01:09:08.500
Look.

01:09:08.583 --> 01:09:11.583
Move back. I'm coming out with the boy.

01:09:11.666 --> 01:09:13.000
Don't drag him into this.

01:09:15.291 --> 01:09:17.375
Everyone stay calm.

01:09:17.458 --> 01:09:18.625
-Dani, son.
-Hey!

01:09:18.708 --> 01:09:20.458
-Son.
-Don't come any closer!

01:09:20.541 --> 01:09:22.416
-Come here.
-Stay back!

01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:25.000
-I'm sorry, Dad.
-I'm sorry.

01:09:25.958 --> 01:09:27.416
It's okay, buddy.

01:09:28.250 --> 01:09:29.708
I'm so sorry.

01:09:30.958 --> 01:09:32.625
I'll kill this bastard.

01:09:32.708 --> 01:09:34.041
-Don't hurt me.
-Luis.

01:09:34.125 --> 01:09:36.416
-Don't hurt him.
-Don't come any closer.

01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:38.208
-He's a kid!
-Don't follow me!

01:09:39.875 --> 01:09:41.541
-Calm down.
-Dani.

01:09:41.625 --> 01:09:43.625
-Dani.
-Get in.

01:09:43.708 --> 01:09:47.375
-Stand over there.
-Okay. Here.

01:09:47.458 --> 01:09:49.500
-Dani, it's okay.
-Stay calm.

01:09:49.583 --> 01:09:52.541
-That's it.
-He didn't do anything.

01:09:52.625 --> 01:09:54.166
-He's just a kid.
-Please.

01:09:54.250 --> 01:09:55.250
Let him go!

01:09:58.458 --> 01:09:59.750
Stay back!

01:10:00.333 --> 01:10:01.875
You stay inside!

01:10:01.958 --> 01:10:04.250
-Stay inside!
-Let him go.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.833
Dani, baby. I'm sorry.

01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:10.416
It's okay, son.

01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:12.500
-Dani.
-We'll stay here. Let him go.

01:10:12.583 --> 01:10:14.166
-Let him go.
-Luis, stay there.

01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:15.291
Don't hurt him.

01:10:15.375 --> 01:10:17.250
Listen to me.

01:10:17.333 --> 01:10:18.958
I need the car keys.

01:10:19.041 --> 01:10:20.583
Give me the keys.

01:10:20.666 --> 01:10:23.166
Don't. He'll take him.

01:10:23.250 --> 01:10:25.416
-Santiago, please…
-Give me the keys!

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:27.333
I don't have them!

01:10:27.416 --> 01:10:29.791
-Fuck!
-I don't know where I put them.

01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:31.500
Please.

01:10:31.583 --> 01:10:33.416
Let him go. He didn't do anything.

01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.041
-Let him go!
-Let him go!

01:10:35.125 --> 01:10:36.500
Let him go. Now!

01:10:36.583 --> 01:10:38.666
-No!
-No!

01:10:40.208 --> 01:10:41.833
Come out, and I'll hurt him!

01:10:41.916 --> 01:10:43.958
-Okay.
-Mara, stay by the door!

01:10:44.041 --> 01:10:45.750
Fuck!

01:10:45.833 --> 01:10:47.958
Stay back! Luis!

01:10:48.041 --> 01:10:50.166
We'll stay here! Just don't take him!

01:10:50.250 --> 01:10:52.750
Calm down. Don't hurt him.

01:10:52.833 --> 01:10:55.083
-Don't hurt him!
-The keys are in the car.

01:10:55.166 --> 01:10:56.208
-What?
-The keys.

01:10:56.291 --> 01:10:58.000
He's taking him in his van.

01:10:58.083 --> 01:11:00.291
-Mom!
-No!

01:11:00.375 --> 01:11:02.125
-No, Dani!
-Quiet!

01:11:02.208 --> 01:11:03.666
-Dani!
-Stay there!

01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:06.041
-I'll claw your eyes out.
-Get in. I'm sorry.

01:11:06.125 --> 01:11:10.083
Please, Santi. Don't take him.
He's taking him!

01:11:10.166 --> 01:11:12.041
-Buckle up.
-No!

01:11:18.041 --> 01:11:19.250
-Hey! No!
-Stop!

01:11:19.333 --> 01:11:21.458
-Dani!
-Mom!

01:11:21.541 --> 01:11:23.083
-No! Dani!
-Mom!

01:11:23.166 --> 01:11:24.916
Santi!

01:11:35.583 --> 01:11:37.250
-Dani!
-You bastard!

01:11:37.333 --> 01:11:38.333
Dani!

01:11:42.541 --> 01:11:43.708
Mom!

01:11:54.166 --> 01:11:56.708
Okay, Dani. Get out.

01:11:57.291 --> 01:11:58.500
Run back to them!

01:11:58.583 --> 01:12:00.750
Okay? Get out of the car.

01:12:00.833 --> 01:12:02.416
Get out, Dani!

01:12:04.625 --> 01:12:06.541
Dani, get out!

01:12:07.625 --> 01:12:09.458
Get out!

01:12:10.666 --> 01:12:13.875
-You piece of shit!
-No!

01:12:19.416 --> 01:12:20.958
Stop!

01:12:21.041 --> 01:12:23.166
Stop, Luis, stop! Stop!

01:12:34.333 --> 01:12:35.416
Santi, no!

01:12:37.291 --> 01:12:38.416
Santi, stop! Luis!

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.416
Please stop!

01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:42.791
Stop! Santi, enough!

01:12:43.666 --> 01:12:44.625
Leave him alone!

01:12:44.708 --> 01:12:45.750
No!

01:13:06.416 --> 01:13:07.958
It's okay. You all right?

01:13:08.541 --> 01:13:09.500
Luis!

01:13:10.041 --> 01:13:12.000
I'm sorry, Luis. I'm sorry.

01:13:15.083 --> 01:13:16.291
No…

01:13:22.791 --> 01:13:24.666
Stop! Luis! No! What are you doing?

01:13:24.750 --> 01:13:26.833
-No!
-What were you gonna do to my son?

01:13:27.416 --> 01:13:29.000
No!

01:13:29.083 --> 01:13:31.083
-Luis!
-Where's my niece?

01:13:31.166 --> 01:13:33.791
I know where Lide is!

01:13:34.666 --> 01:13:36.500
-I know where Lide is!
-Stop.

01:13:36.583 --> 01:13:37.833
He knows where she is.

01:13:37.916 --> 01:13:39.750
-I'll tell you.
-Where is she?

01:13:39.833 --> 01:13:43.625
-Where is she? Tell me.
-I'll tell the police.

01:13:43.708 --> 01:13:45.041
-What?
-Absolutely not.

01:13:45.125 --> 01:13:47.041
No, tell me. Where is she?

01:13:47.125 --> 01:13:49.208
-I'll only talk to the police.
-Tell me!

01:13:49.291 --> 01:13:52.375
-I'll only talk to the police.
-Tell me where!

01:13:52.458 --> 01:13:54.041
-In the woods.
-In the woods?

01:13:54.125 --> 01:13:55.291
-Alive?
-Yes.

01:13:55.375 --> 01:13:57.875
-She's alive, Elena.
-She's alive.

01:13:57.958 --> 01:13:59.875
She's okay. Take me to her.

01:14:01.166 --> 01:14:02.416
Come on, please!

01:14:03.625 --> 01:14:06.375
Get up. Let's go!

01:14:08.708 --> 01:14:10.666
-Which way?
-This way.

01:14:11.333 --> 01:14:12.458
Straight?

01:14:13.083 --> 01:14:14.208
This way?

01:14:14.875 --> 01:14:16.083
Take Dani.

01:14:16.166 --> 01:14:19.333
If we're not back in two hours,
call the police.

01:14:19.416 --> 01:14:22.125
-We'll come back in his car, okay?
-Okay.

01:14:22.916 --> 01:14:24.041
Here.

01:14:40.041 --> 01:14:41.208
Which way?

01:14:41.958 --> 01:14:44.083
-Which way?
-Straight ahead.

01:14:46.333 --> 01:14:47.500
Say it.

01:14:48.291 --> 01:14:50.250
We did what we had to do.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.208
Shut up!

01:14:55.250 --> 01:14:57.833
-I'm terrified of you, Luis.
-Of me?

01:15:07.291 --> 01:15:10.250
We're going to find Lide, okay?

01:15:20.666 --> 01:15:23.250
-Where is she?
-Right here! We're so close!

01:15:23.333 --> 01:15:25.791
-He's taking us toward the fire.
-Stop!

01:15:26.291 --> 01:15:29.166
-Where's my daughter?
-Please, listen to me.

01:15:29.250 --> 01:15:30.791
-What?
-What?

01:15:30.875 --> 01:15:34.416
I'm sorry you're hurting.
I'm so sorry, but I…

01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:35.833
What?

01:15:35.916 --> 01:15:36.958
I'm sorry.

01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.083
-Luis!
-He got away!

01:15:44.875 --> 01:15:46.333
Stop! No!

01:15:56.208 --> 01:15:58.291
I can't see him!

01:15:59.625 --> 01:16:01.333
Where'd he go?

01:16:19.708 --> 01:16:22.125
-Mara!
-Luis!

01:16:35.125 --> 01:16:36.125
Mara!

01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:40.750
Luis!

01:16:48.041 --> 01:16:49.083
Mara!

01:17:14.291 --> 01:17:16.000
Help!

01:17:18.083 --> 01:17:19.166
Lide.

01:17:20.458 --> 01:17:21.541
Lide.

01:17:21.625 --> 01:17:24.125
Lide!

01:17:29.875 --> 01:17:31.083
Keep shouting!

01:17:36.291 --> 01:17:37.791
Over here!

01:17:44.083 --> 01:17:45.708
I'm here!

01:17:45.791 --> 01:17:47.833
Lide, yell!

01:17:47.916 --> 01:17:49.208
I'm here!

01:17:53.541 --> 01:17:55.541
I'm in a hole.

01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:58.625
I'm down here!

01:18:00.333 --> 01:18:01.416
Lide.

01:18:01.916 --> 01:18:03.416
I'm down here.

01:18:03.958 --> 01:18:05.000
Lide!

01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:08.750
Lide, look at me.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.833
-It's Santi. Look.
-I'm stuck. I can't move.

01:18:15.833 --> 01:18:17.791
-Let me see.
-Help!

01:18:17.875 --> 01:18:20.250
Give me your hand.

01:18:21.208 --> 01:18:23.250
Come on! Give me your hand!

01:18:24.583 --> 01:18:27.041
That's it. Stretch. Grab my hand!

01:18:27.125 --> 01:18:29.541
-Pull!
-Give me your hand.

01:18:29.625 --> 01:18:32.000
I can't reach. Push it away.

01:18:32.583 --> 01:18:34.416
-The dirt…
-I can't!

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.666
Come on! I'll reach you!

01:18:36.750 --> 01:18:39.125
-I can't!
-Yes, you can!

01:18:39.208 --> 01:18:40.291
I can't reach!

01:18:40.375 --> 01:18:41.750
Come on!

01:18:45.666 --> 01:18:46.875
Wait.

01:18:46.958 --> 01:18:48.666
-I'll get a stick.
-No!

01:18:48.750 --> 01:18:51.083
-I'll be right back, okay?
-Please come back!

01:19:16.458 --> 01:19:18.958
-Lide, hang on.
-I can't.

01:19:19.041 --> 01:19:20.208
Now!

01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:23.916
That's it. You can do it. Pull hard.

01:19:36.666 --> 01:19:38.125
Okay. Come on.

01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:40.666
I've got you.

01:19:44.958 --> 01:19:46.083
That's it.

01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:49.250
Lide.

01:19:51.833 --> 01:19:53.708
Lide?

01:19:56.166 --> 01:19:57.125
Can you hear me?

01:19:58.041 --> 01:19:59.625
No!

01:19:59.708 --> 01:20:01.708
-No!
-Mara, no!

01:20:09.708 --> 01:20:11.625
-Mom?
-Honey.

01:20:13.791 --> 01:20:14.875
Are you okay?

01:20:14.958 --> 01:20:16.500
-Mom.
-Are you okay?

01:20:16.583 --> 01:20:19.625
-Mom!
-What? What is it?

01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:25.250
-I didn't know where you were.
-Mom!

01:20:25.833 --> 01:20:27.041
I'm sorry.

01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:31.833
My leg really hurts!

01:20:31.916 --> 01:20:33.041
It's okay, baby.

01:20:33.125 --> 01:20:35.000
You're okay now.

01:20:35.083 --> 01:20:37.541
Here. Cover your face. Can you do that?

01:20:37.625 --> 01:20:40.583
Okay? Like this?

01:20:45.250 --> 01:20:46.875
Come on. Let's go.

01:21:07.458 --> 01:21:09.666
We're almost there.

01:21:10.250 --> 01:21:11.708
What about Santi?

01:21:11.791 --> 01:21:13.875
Did he hurt you?

01:21:13.958 --> 01:21:15.166
I fell.

01:21:16.875 --> 01:21:20.291
I fell… into a hole.

01:21:21.541 --> 01:21:25.041
There was so much dirt.
I couldn't get out.

01:21:25.125 --> 01:21:26.000
What?

01:21:26.083 --> 01:21:28.166
I was chased by a bear.

01:21:28.708 --> 01:21:30.833
-And I fell.
-What?

01:21:32.458 --> 01:21:34.416
I couldn't find the house.

01:21:37.250 --> 01:21:38.250
Lide…

01:21:40.208 --> 01:21:41.208
He…

01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:44.375
He pushed you into that pit, didn't he?

01:21:44.458 --> 01:21:45.500
-Huh?
-No.

01:21:46.208 --> 01:21:48.250
Santiago. Yes, he did.

01:21:48.333 --> 01:21:50.750
-He saved me.
-He pushed you.

01:21:50.833 --> 01:21:52.125
He saved me.

01:21:53.708 --> 01:21:54.750
Wha--

01:21:55.250 --> 01:21:57.083
He didn't push you?

01:21:57.166 --> 01:21:58.458
No.

01:21:59.583 --> 01:22:01.666
-You fell by yourself?
-Yes.

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:06.416
Lide, I need you to tell me
if Santi hurt you.

01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:08.583
-Did he do anything to you?
-No.

01:22:11.375 --> 01:22:12.375
All right.

01:22:31.916 --> 01:22:32.958
Mara!

01:22:33.791 --> 01:22:34.791
Luis.

01:22:35.333 --> 01:22:36.708
-Luis.
-Lide!

01:22:37.375 --> 01:22:38.500
Lide!

01:22:40.833 --> 01:22:42.500
-Is she okay?
-She's okay.

01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:46.291
-Honey, are you okay?
-Yes.

01:22:46.375 --> 01:22:49.083
Are you alright, sweetheart?
Where was she?

01:22:49.166 --> 01:22:50.166
-She fell.
-Where?

01:22:50.250 --> 01:22:52.458
In a pit. But she's okay.

01:22:52.541 --> 01:22:54.208
-A pit?
-Yeah.

01:22:54.916 --> 01:22:56.666
Is she hurt? She's hurt.

01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:59.958
She thought she saw a bear,
and she fell in.

01:23:00.708 --> 01:23:01.958
Was it Santi?

01:23:02.041 --> 01:23:05.625
No, she just fell. She needs to go
to the hospital, but she's okay.

01:23:05.708 --> 01:23:07.541
-I'm cold.
-Let's get out of here.

01:23:07.625 --> 01:23:10.416
-Right.
-She needs a doctor.

01:23:12.750 --> 01:23:14.583
-Let's get out of here.
-It's okay.

01:23:14.666 --> 01:23:17.208
-Let's follow the firebreak home.
-Let's go.

01:23:17.833 --> 01:23:19.416
We're here now.

01:23:27.583 --> 01:23:29.708
-The keys?
-I've got them.

01:23:29.791 --> 01:23:31.458
-See if it's open.
-It is.

01:23:32.375 --> 01:23:33.541
It's over, baby.

01:23:34.875 --> 01:23:36.041
There.

01:23:36.125 --> 01:23:37.875
-Get some water.
-Right.

01:23:37.958 --> 01:23:40.083
-And blankets.
-Coming.

01:23:40.625 --> 01:23:41.666
Honey.

01:23:42.791 --> 01:23:45.083
It's okay. Does your leg hurt?

01:23:45.166 --> 01:23:46.708
-Not as much now.
-No?

01:23:47.291 --> 01:23:49.416
Does your head hurt?

01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:51.083
Anything else hurt?

01:23:51.166 --> 01:23:53.375
-No?
-I'm cold.

01:23:53.458 --> 01:23:55.750
Your uncle's bringing blankets.

01:24:28.416 --> 01:24:29.500
I love you.

01:24:32.291 --> 01:24:34.166
-I love you.
-Me too.

01:24:34.250 --> 01:24:36.125
I love you.

01:24:41.583 --> 01:24:42.666
Now, sweetie…

01:24:45.541 --> 01:24:48.166
Your uncle's taking you
to the hospital right away.

01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:50.000
The doctor will check you out.

01:24:50.083 --> 01:24:52.041
Everything will be okay.

01:24:55.333 --> 01:24:56.916
He'll take care of you.

01:25:24.125 --> 01:25:25.375
Mara?

01:25:25.458 --> 01:25:26.708
I'm thirsty.

01:25:27.833 --> 01:25:29.208
Right, honey.

01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:30.833
There.

01:25:32.416 --> 01:25:35.916
Hey, wait. Slow down, honey.

01:25:36.458 --> 01:25:37.541
Easy.

01:25:42.375 --> 01:25:44.125
That's it. Where did your mom go?

01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:46.541
Where's Mom?

01:25:46.625 --> 01:25:48.166
She left.

01:25:48.250 --> 01:25:49.958
-Which way?
-Straight ahead.

01:25:51.833 --> 01:25:53.250
Into the woods?

01:25:53.333 --> 01:25:54.958
-Yes.
-Yes?

01:26:14.416 --> 01:26:15.458
Mara!

01:26:19.291 --> 01:26:20.375
Mara!

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.041
Lide.

01:26:40.125 --> 01:26:41.875
Lide, hey.

01:26:42.416 --> 01:26:44.708
Lide, don't fall asleep, sweetie.

01:26:44.791 --> 01:26:46.250
Look at me, Lide.

01:26:51.583 --> 01:26:52.583
Stay here.

01:26:56.458 --> 01:26:58.458
Lide. Wake up.

01:28:52.083 --> 01:28:53.166
EMERGENCY

01:29:07.708 --> 01:29:09.000
Where's Mara?

01:29:11.250 --> 01:29:12.250
Are you family?

01:29:12.333 --> 01:29:14.166
No. I found him on the road.

01:29:15.083 --> 01:29:17.583
Can you hear me? Do you understand?

01:29:18.291 --> 01:29:19.958
Why were you on the road?

01:29:20.041 --> 01:29:22.375
-What happened?
-She got lost in the woods.

01:29:22.458 --> 01:29:23.666
She breathed in smoke.

01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:25.583
-Can you hear me?
-She fell in a pit.

01:29:25.666 --> 01:29:28.666
-She hasn't had water.
-Can you hear me? Look at me.

01:29:28.750 --> 01:29:31.500
-She's responsive.
-She hit her head here.

01:29:31.583 --> 01:29:33.208
We need an X-ray of her arm.

01:29:33.291 --> 01:29:35.875
-When did you find her?
-About an hour ago.

01:29:35.958 --> 01:29:37.833
-How old is she?
-Eight years old.

01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:45.000
-What do we have?
-Smoke inhalation.

01:29:45.083 --> 01:29:46.500
I'll get Dr. Bautista.

01:29:50.416 --> 01:29:52.541
Check her heart rate, pulse, and BP.

01:29:52.625 --> 01:29:55.250
You can't come in, sir. We'll update you.

01:29:56.791 --> 01:29:57.916
Can you hear me?

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:03.416
What's your name?

01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:06.250
-Santiago.
-Santiago, why were you on the road?

01:30:06.333 --> 01:30:09.041
What happened? Prep trauma bay four.

01:30:21.666 --> 01:30:23.416
Pupils, normal.

01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:25.333
-Any severe pain?
-Everywhere.

01:30:25.416 --> 01:30:26.416
-Everywhere?
-Yeah.

01:30:27.833 --> 01:30:29.958
-We'll start an IV, okay?
-Okay.

01:30:31.708 --> 01:30:33.750
-I'm dizzy.
-We'll lay you down.

01:30:33.833 --> 01:30:35.291
Oxygen, please.

01:30:35.375 --> 01:30:37.416
-Weight?
-Forty-two pounds.

01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:39.333
-What's her name?
-Lide.

01:30:39.416 --> 01:30:42.833
-Lide, can you open your eyes?
-She's weak. Inhaled a lot of smoke.

01:30:42.916 --> 01:30:44.916
Pulse ox 95. Close the curtains.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.625
Shut the door too, please.

01:31:24.958 --> 01:31:28.125
Honey, we found Lide.
We're at the hospital.

01:31:29.666 --> 01:31:31.125
I'll text you the address.

01:31:31.208 --> 01:31:32.833
I'd like you to come here.

01:31:33.333 --> 01:31:35.458
-Good evening.
-Hello. How are you?

01:31:35.541 --> 01:31:37.458
-Did you call?
-Yes, that was us.

01:31:37.541 --> 01:31:40.250
-Which way?
-The observation area.

01:31:40.333 --> 01:31:41.541
Follow me.

01:32:04.708 --> 01:32:05.791
Santiago.

01:32:11.916 --> 01:32:14.708
Call Radiology. Set up a CT scan.

01:32:16.875 --> 01:32:17.958
Excuse me.

01:32:18.791 --> 01:32:21.916
-Come in.
-Can you give us a moment?

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.375
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

01:32:26.625 --> 01:32:28.416
I don't know… I'm sorry.

01:32:31.916 --> 01:32:32.958
Forgive me.

01:32:34.375 --> 01:32:35.500
I'm so sorry.

01:32:49.333 --> 01:32:51.500
How are you feeling, Santiago?

01:32:51.583 --> 01:32:54.291
Whatever happened, you're safe now.

01:32:54.833 --> 01:32:59.291
Okay. Can you tell us
how you got those cuts on your face?

01:33:02.458 --> 01:33:03.958
It wasn't…

01:33:09.291 --> 01:33:10.916
I'm sorry. I don't…

01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:19.416
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

01:33:31.166 --> 01:33:32.541
I'm sorry.

01:33:34.916 --> 01:33:36.583
I'm sorry.

01:33:41.625 --> 01:33:42.625
It was a bear.

01:33:45.583 --> 01:33:46.625
A bear?

01:33:47.708 --> 01:33:48.958
Yes.

01:33:50.291 --> 01:33:52.000
Yes, I was attacked.

01:33:52.833 --> 01:33:54.416
By a bear in the woods.

01:33:59.333 --> 01:34:03.625
I guess she must've been…
protecting her cubs.

01:34:04.708 --> 01:34:07.000
Or she thought she was.

01:34:20.791 --> 01:34:23.291
She couldn't be reasoned with.

01:34:26.291 --> 01:34:28.875
-Mr. Serrano.
-How's my niece?

01:34:28.958 --> 01:34:30.708
Don't worry. Come with me.

01:34:32.166 --> 01:34:33.375
-Come in.
-Is she okay?

01:34:33.458 --> 01:34:35.583
She's sedated, but stable.

01:34:53.208 --> 01:34:56.375
I guess you won't be
pressing charges, then.

01:35:04.125 --> 01:35:05.125
No.

01:35:18.708 --> 01:35:21.125
Can you imagine a bear in jail?

01:37:05.291 --> 01:37:07.458
Lide, honey. How are you?

01:37:08.458 --> 01:37:12.625
Her leg needs time to heal,
and she hit her head, but she's okay.

01:37:12.708 --> 01:37:13.958
How are you?

01:37:14.458 --> 01:37:15.541
Fine.

01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:20.958
I'm sorry I was mean earlier.

01:37:21.041 --> 01:37:24.250
It's okay. I'm sorry too.

01:37:27.125 --> 01:37:28.958
You can't be here, ma'am.

01:37:30.333 --> 01:37:31.750
It's dangerous. Come on.

01:37:32.416 --> 01:37:33.958
Can you hear me?

01:37:36.750 --> 01:37:39.416
-Where's my daughter?
-Are you the missing girl's mom?

01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:42.541
We've been notified she's at the hospital.

01:37:47.541 --> 01:37:50.541
Can you make sure
my house doesn't burn down?

01:37:50.625 --> 01:37:52.750
Don't worry. The fire's under control.

01:37:54.708 --> 01:37:56.583
Come on. Let's go!

01:39:26.125 --> 01:39:28.041
I brought this flower for Lide.

01:39:33.416 --> 01:39:35.166
It's a fire lily.

01:39:40.166 --> 01:39:44.125
It only grows after a fire,
out of the ashes.

01:39:49.875 --> 01:39:51.916
I thought she might want to have it.

01:39:58.291 --> 01:39:59.375
Anyway…

01:40:01.333 --> 01:40:02.333
Santiago…

01:40:03.416 --> 01:40:04.416
Yeah?

01:40:07.250 --> 01:40:08.666
I'm sure she'll love it.

01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:10.958
Thank you.

01:40:34.916 --> 01:40:37.500
FIREBREAK

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:30.000
