EPISODE 12

00:01:07.172 --> 00:01:09.133
SCHOOL BULLETIN BOARD

00:01:09.216 --> 00:01:12.970
HELLO, I'M YOON BOM, THE ETHICS TEACHER

00:02:41.934 --> 00:02:46.188
Don't hide, don't avoid anything,
and don't run.

00:02:47.481 --> 00:02:48.482
Let's go.

00:03:39.074 --> 00:03:41.035
Han-gyul, did you see this?

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:45.998
BULLETIN BOARD

00:03:46.081 --> 00:03:48.459
HELLO, I'M YOON BOM, THE ETHICS TEACHER

00:03:49.418 --> 00:03:50.586
What's this?

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:11.440
Ms. Bom.

00:04:17.071 --> 00:04:18.822
Bom...

00:04:33.087 --> 00:04:34.713
Hello.

00:04:34.797 --> 00:04:37.299
I'm Yoon Bom, the ethics teacher.

00:04:42.471 --> 00:04:48.685
I'm sure many of you have been curious
about why I came down to this town.

00:04:57.486 --> 00:04:59.905
Despite the countless rumors,

00:04:59.988 --> 00:05:02.699
I have been silent about it

00:05:03.492 --> 00:05:04.993
because I was

00:05:05.577 --> 00:05:09.832
in a situation where I needed to be silent
instead of explaining myself at the time.

00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:15.546
I believed that everyone would be happy
as long as I kept silent,

00:05:16.755 --> 00:05:21.593
and I believed that my wounded heart
would heal with time.

00:05:22.553 --> 00:05:24.596
But I've realized

00:05:25.222 --> 00:05:30.644
the truth can only be protected
with courage, not with time.

00:05:32.062 --> 00:05:33.438
So now,

00:05:34.231 --> 00:05:37.526
I'm bringing myself to tell all of you
what I went through.

00:06:06.847 --> 00:06:07.723
Mom.

00:06:09.683 --> 00:06:11.185
Actually, I…

00:06:18.358 --> 00:06:19.776
I almost had a heart attack.

00:06:20.527 --> 00:06:21.486
Who's that now?

00:06:22.821 --> 00:06:24.907
Could it be a reporter?

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.866
What?

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:30.078
I'm sure it isn't. I'll go check.

00:06:36.752 --> 00:06:38.337
I'm sorry if you're offended.

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:42.925
But, as you said,
getting first place is pointless for me.

00:06:44.092 --> 00:06:47.012
I don't need good grades
since I'm not going to college.

00:06:47.095 --> 00:06:49.181
And I don't have parents fussing about it.

00:06:52.768 --> 00:06:54.186
It must've been fun.

00:06:55.896 --> 00:06:58.941
I had no idea
and said studying was a stamina game

00:06:59.024 --> 00:07:01.693
and that it felt like
the world noticed my effort.

00:07:02.277 --> 00:07:05.781
Watching me think I really beat you
must've been fun.

00:07:06.365 --> 00:07:08.700
I wanted to give you first place
as a present.

00:07:09.576 --> 00:07:10.619
That's all.

00:07:11.203 --> 00:07:13.247
Do you seriously think that's a present?

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:18.418
Giving someone what they want the most,
isn't that what a present is?

00:07:22.798 --> 00:07:24.091
Don't contact me for a while.

00:07:24.174 --> 00:07:25.092
What?

00:07:25.175 --> 00:07:28.387
I'll stop seeing you now
and focus on my studies.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.473
But, Se-jin, we just started going out.

00:07:31.556 --> 00:07:33.100
Coming first on my own terms…

00:07:35.769 --> 00:07:37.729
That's the present I want the most.

00:07:46.488 --> 00:07:47.614
Hello.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.242
I'm Sun Jae-gyu.

00:07:51.243 --> 00:07:52.536
I told him to come.

00:07:54.121 --> 00:07:56.999
Jae-gyu told me
he had something to discuss with you.

00:07:57.833 --> 00:07:59.751
We were gathering here anyway,

00:08:00.544 --> 00:08:03.088
and I thought it'd be better
to discuss it together.

00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:08.343
I met the department head at Disfact
before coming here.

00:08:08.927 --> 00:08:09.886
What?

00:08:14.141 --> 00:08:19.146
Can you can delete all the copies
of the conversation you recorded here?

00:08:24.901 --> 00:08:28.155
I mean, it's so easy
to make copies these days.

00:08:28.238 --> 00:08:30.198
So I need to be sure.

00:08:33.452 --> 00:08:35.454
Look. I need you

00:08:36.913 --> 00:08:39.583
to delete the original and copies
from your hard drive

00:08:39.666 --> 00:08:42.461
and cloud drive in front of me.
All of them.

00:08:43.795 --> 00:08:46.590
And drop the request
for a preliminary injunction.

00:08:52.721 --> 00:08:54.097
You see,

00:08:56.808 --> 00:09:00.979
I have a bad habit of getting things done
at all costs once I set my mind to it.

00:09:02.731 --> 00:09:05.400
If I delete the recording
and you publish the article,

00:09:05.484 --> 00:09:07.235
there will be no more settlement.

00:09:07.319 --> 00:09:08.695
And I'll take legal action

00:09:08.779 --> 00:09:11.281
against everything
including this agreement.

00:09:13.325 --> 00:09:14.493
You will…

00:09:17.454 --> 00:09:19.206
pay for your mistake.

00:09:22.459 --> 00:09:25.754
He promised not to publish the article.

00:09:27.381 --> 00:09:29.257
I can finally breathe again.

00:09:30.759 --> 00:09:32.928
It feels like I've been
dragged out of my coffin.

00:09:34.054 --> 00:09:37.557
I'll meet the reporter
and take care of legal matters tomorrow.

00:09:37.641 --> 00:09:38.558
Bom.

00:09:39.559 --> 00:09:41.353
You should be relieved too.

00:09:42.396 --> 00:09:43.647
It's all over now.

00:09:46.108 --> 00:09:47.567
It's not over for me yet.

00:09:57.828 --> 00:09:59.996
I'm sorry, Mom. I…

00:10:04.334 --> 00:10:07.003
I posted it on the school bulletin board.

00:10:07.921 --> 00:10:08.797
Post what?

00:10:09.756 --> 00:10:11.800
About why I came to the town

00:10:13.301 --> 00:10:15.178
and what I'd gone through.

00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:18.473
Everything.

00:10:20.183 --> 00:10:21.810
You foolish brat!

00:10:21.893 --> 00:10:22.978
Honey.

00:10:23.061 --> 00:10:25.355
You're too good for your own good.

00:10:25.439 --> 00:10:29.109
The reporter was about to quit,
so why would you reveal it first?

00:10:30.861 --> 00:10:31.695
Mom.

00:10:32.988 --> 00:10:35.407
I still have nightmares every night.

00:10:36.116 --> 00:10:38.702
About the woman slapping me
in front of the students

00:10:40.162 --> 00:10:42.706
and about the man
being in front of my place.

00:10:48.503 --> 00:10:50.005
If the world forgot about it,

00:10:51.715 --> 00:10:54.301
I thought it would
be erased from my mind too.

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:55.844
But, no.

00:10:56.636 --> 00:10:58.138
Even if the world might have,

00:10:59.723 --> 00:11:01.475
I can't forget about it.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:14.112
I did as you said back then,

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:17.199
so please listen to me this time.

00:11:19.451 --> 00:11:20.494
Please.

00:11:53.443 --> 00:11:55.153
Will you really be all right?

00:11:56.863 --> 00:11:58.406
Of course not.

00:12:00.242 --> 00:12:02.786
Then how about doing it tomorrow,
not today?

00:12:03.495 --> 00:12:04.996
Or do you want me to go in with you?

00:12:05.497 --> 00:12:06.331
No.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.751
I'm scared and nervous,
and I want to hide,

00:12:12.212 --> 00:12:14.172
but I have to sort this out myself.

00:12:17.467 --> 00:12:18.385
All right.

00:12:18.468 --> 00:12:22.097
Then good luck with it.
I'll be waiting here until you're done.

00:12:38.655 --> 00:12:41.658
All of you have read what I posted, right?

00:12:49.249 --> 00:12:53.003
I've always told you that
what needs to be done needs to be done.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.841
However, I myself have been
putting off what I needed to do.

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:00.010
And as a teacher,

00:13:01.344 --> 00:13:04.097
especially as someone teaching you ethics,

00:13:06.558 --> 00:13:07.934
I feel so ashamed.

00:13:11.062 --> 00:13:13.732
Even if you don't believe me,
there's nothing I can do.

00:13:14.608 --> 00:13:15.775
But still…

00:13:19.029 --> 00:13:20.488
I hope you do.

00:13:25.368 --> 00:13:30.415
And now,
there's not much time left between us.

00:13:31.249 --> 00:13:32.959
Putting aside what happened today,

00:13:33.043 --> 00:13:37.714
I'm going to do my best
to teach you until the end.

00:13:38.298 --> 00:13:39.299
Any questions?

00:13:41.217 --> 00:13:42.052
Yes, Se-jin.

00:13:43.803 --> 00:13:47.474
Ma'am, is our school going to
open the special class for the mock exam?

00:13:51.436 --> 00:13:54.522
I'll talk to the principal about that.

00:13:55.607 --> 00:14:00.403
Or, how about our class does
self-study sessions during the break?

00:14:01.029 --> 00:14:04.366
Geez… Choi Se-jin,
stop making such a fuss.

00:14:04.449 --> 00:14:07.160
-Why would we do that during the break?
-Exactly.

00:14:12.332 --> 00:14:13.291
Quiet.

00:14:13.375 --> 00:14:16.002
I know finals are over,
but don't hang around,

00:14:16.086 --> 00:14:17.504
and go straight home, okay?

00:14:17.587 --> 00:14:18.797
Yes, ma'am.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:19.756
Get home safe.

00:14:19.839 --> 00:14:21.508
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

00:14:25.512 --> 00:14:28.056
Ms. Bom just dismissed her class.

00:14:28.139 --> 00:14:29.099
She'll be here soon.

00:14:30.225 --> 00:14:32.519
When she comes,
no one says anything, okay?

00:14:32.602 --> 00:14:35.438
But we should ask her
about the bulletin board.

00:14:36.064 --> 00:14:38.608
She's been suffering because of it
since yesterday.

00:14:38.692 --> 00:14:41.152
How do you think she must've felt
to post it herself?

00:14:41.236 --> 00:14:43.822
Since she posted herself,
we should ask her

00:14:43.905 --> 00:14:46.241
whether she really had an affair or not.

00:14:46.324 --> 00:14:47.534
For God's sake.

00:14:48.076 --> 00:14:51.538
I already got the answer to that,
so ask me what you want to know.

00:14:51.621 --> 00:14:55.458
I heard it from Attorney Choi I-jun
that you like so much.

00:14:56.835 --> 00:14:58.420
Attorney Choi?

00:15:01.256 --> 00:15:02.799
Oh, she's here.

00:15:06.344 --> 00:15:10.807
Well, should I have soju with chicken feet
or beer with fried chicken?

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:12.684
How about soju with pork belly?

00:15:12.767 --> 00:15:14.144
Sounds great.

00:15:14.227 --> 00:15:15.061
Ms. Bom.

00:15:15.145 --> 00:15:18.148
We need to conduct a survey
regarding summer break classes,

00:15:18.231 --> 00:15:20.275
so please draw up the letter to parents.

00:15:23.236 --> 00:15:24.446
Ms. Bom.

00:15:24.529 --> 00:15:26.656
The principal's talking to you.

00:15:28.867 --> 00:15:31.661
Sure. I'll finish it
and give it you tomorrow.

00:15:32.787 --> 00:15:33.621
Okay.

00:15:57.061 --> 00:15:59.647
Mr. Park, this is Hong Jung-pyo.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.400
What happened?

00:16:03.109 --> 00:16:05.403
You told me it would make headlines,

00:16:05.487 --> 00:16:08.031
so I even told you
about her dating the thug.

00:16:09.407 --> 00:16:10.241
What?

00:16:11.451 --> 00:16:12.368
You pulled it?

00:16:18.166 --> 00:16:19.501
What are you…

00:16:23.713 --> 00:16:25.298
Hey, I-jun.

00:16:26.508 --> 00:16:28.218
I caught the one who tipped them off.

00:16:29.052 --> 00:16:30.094
Who?

00:16:32.138 --> 00:16:34.182
Well, the one who did it is…

00:16:36.059 --> 00:16:39.145
Hello? Mr. Choi, this is Hong Jung-pyo.

00:16:39.771 --> 00:16:40.980
It wasn't me.

00:16:41.064 --> 00:16:45.610
The reporter already knew about
the affair when he came to me.

00:16:45.693 --> 00:16:48.530
All I did was just humor him a little.

00:16:49.864 --> 00:16:52.283
Something like this won't happen again.

00:16:52.784 --> 00:16:56.579
So please don't tell the governor.

00:16:57.163 --> 00:16:58.832
Sure. Goodbye.

00:17:01.709 --> 00:17:03.002
DISFACT REPORTER PARK

00:17:03.086 --> 00:17:04.420
DELETE

00:17:05.046 --> 00:17:06.172
What are you doing?

00:17:06.256 --> 00:17:08.758
You said you wouldn't do it again,
so I helped you.

00:17:08.842 --> 00:17:09.759
Here.

00:17:20.228 --> 00:17:23.106
WELCOME TO SHINSU MARKET

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.115
Will you be okay?

00:17:32.198 --> 00:17:34.284
This is the most crowded place in town.

00:17:34.367 --> 00:17:38.121
Now that I've revealed my secret,
I should get used to criticism.

00:17:39.414 --> 00:17:41.499
If anyone criticizes you,

00:17:41.583 --> 00:17:44.168
I'll be your shield to protect you.

00:17:49.048 --> 00:17:49.883
Auntie.

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:51.593
I heard the rumor.

00:17:53.469 --> 00:17:55.513
I thought you two were married.

00:17:55.597 --> 00:17:56.973
Well, that's…

00:17:57.056 --> 00:17:58.808
If you're not, marry him already.

00:17:59.392 --> 00:18:01.311
Just have three or four kids,

00:18:02.103 --> 00:18:04.397
then he'll raise them really well.

00:18:06.649 --> 00:18:07.609
Geez.

00:18:12.864 --> 00:18:14.574
-Ms. Bom.
-Ma'am.

00:18:14.657 --> 00:18:15.575
Ma'am.

00:18:16.326 --> 00:18:18.202
I heard it from Dong-pyo this morning.

00:18:21.915 --> 00:18:24.250
I made some porridge. Come pick it up.

00:18:25.835 --> 00:18:26.669
Porridge?

00:18:27.378 --> 00:18:31.007
We had a good sesame harvest this year
thanks to Han-gyul's uncle.

00:18:32.175 --> 00:18:33.176
Goodness.

00:18:33.259 --> 00:18:40.099
Dong-pyo was worried sick about you,
so I made a big pot of porridge, okay?

00:18:41.142 --> 00:18:42.143
Thank you.

00:18:43.519 --> 00:18:44.771
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:18:51.653 --> 00:18:55.573
I guess people in Shinsu
aren't that harsh after all.

00:18:55.657 --> 00:18:56.824
They are, actually.

00:18:56.908 --> 00:18:59.744
I went through a lot
because of the rumor that I was a thug.

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:02.789
I can't believe these people.

00:19:02.872 --> 00:19:04.374
They treat you so differently.

00:19:04.457 --> 00:19:06.292
This is why your impression is important.

00:19:06.376 --> 00:19:10.797
They were so harsh to me,
while they are all so kind to you.

00:19:11.422 --> 00:19:13.257
Let's go. I'll buy you pumpkin sikhye.

00:19:13.341 --> 00:19:15.093
It's the best cure for cooling down.

00:19:15.176 --> 00:19:16.135
This way.

00:19:17.053 --> 00:19:18.179
Goodness.

00:19:18.262 --> 00:19:19.514
It's over there.

00:19:25.895 --> 00:19:26.854
Han-gyul.

00:19:28.731 --> 00:19:30.650
Why are you out here?

00:19:32.527 --> 00:19:34.988
REPORT CARD

00:19:40.076 --> 00:19:41.285
I'm sorry, Uncle.

00:19:42.078 --> 00:19:43.579
I wasn't thinking straight.

00:19:45.289 --> 00:19:47.125
You shouldn't apologize to me.

00:19:48.543 --> 00:19:50.420
You should apologize to Se-jin.

00:19:51.254 --> 00:19:52.964
I know it was wrong.

00:19:54.382 --> 00:19:57.719
But I truly did it for Se-jin.

00:19:59.303 --> 00:20:02.432
Her parents looked down on her
because she always came second,

00:20:02.515 --> 00:20:04.308
so I wanted it to stop.

00:20:04.392 --> 00:20:06.269
The one who looked down on her the most

00:20:08.021 --> 00:20:09.063
is you, Han-gyul.

00:20:09.647 --> 00:20:10.815
It's me?

00:20:12.191 --> 00:20:16.029
You decided she had no chance
no matter how hard she tried.

00:20:16.654 --> 00:20:20.575
That's why you thought you should
just let her come first. Right?

00:20:22.785 --> 00:20:24.412
That's not a present.

00:20:26.664 --> 00:20:27.790
That's charity.

00:20:40.219 --> 00:20:41.387
Here, have this.

00:20:47.894 --> 00:20:48.728
Uncle.

00:20:49.979 --> 00:20:50.813
What?

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.401
Can I go to college?

00:20:59.322 --> 00:21:01.324
-Is that also because of Se-jin?
-No.

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:06.037
To tell the truth,
I've wanted to go to college,

00:21:06.788 --> 00:21:09.332
but I thought
I couldn't leave you here alone.

00:21:10.583 --> 00:21:12.251
So once I graduated,

00:21:12.335 --> 00:21:14.337
I was going to work with you
at your company.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:15.838
I don't need you.

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:19.133
Talk about getting ahead of yourself.

00:21:19.217 --> 00:21:22.637
Phillip's doing a good job.
And who said I would hire you?

00:21:23.262 --> 00:21:25.014
You're ridiculous.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:27.892
Will you really be okay alone?

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:31.395
Both Ms. Bom and I will be going to Seoul.

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:35.817
Ms. Bom?

00:21:36.484 --> 00:21:38.611
Her term as an exchange teacher ends soon.

00:21:45.409 --> 00:21:47.120
Is it time already?

00:21:52.166 --> 00:21:54.794
Then I should start preparing myself.

00:22:01.259 --> 00:22:02.844
The meat is so good.

00:22:04.637 --> 00:22:06.222
I wonder if Ms. Bom's okay.

00:22:06.305 --> 00:22:10.685
Geez, woman, stop worrying about her
and try this meat.

00:22:13.771 --> 00:22:15.356
Forget it. I'm leaving.

00:22:15.439 --> 00:22:18.151
What? Why would you leave
in the middle of eating?

00:22:18.734 --> 00:22:20.153
Does it not suit your taste?

00:22:20.236 --> 00:22:22.196
Or did I make a mistake?

00:22:23.156 --> 00:22:25.241
I swear, I'll sew your mouth shut.

00:22:26.325 --> 00:22:27.201
Why?

00:22:27.285 --> 00:22:29.120
Just call me Ms. Seo instead.

00:22:29.203 --> 00:22:33.207
Who'd want to be called "woman"
at a nice restaurant on a Saturday?

00:22:34.208 --> 00:22:36.752
Geez, so that was the problem.

00:22:36.836 --> 00:22:38.963
All right, fine. I got it.

00:22:39.046 --> 00:22:44.677
If I called you
"old man," would you like it?

00:22:45.761 --> 00:22:48.055
If I don't call you "woman,"

00:22:48.139 --> 00:22:49.515
what should I call you?

00:22:51.934 --> 00:22:53.603
-Hey, you.
-"Hey, you"?

00:22:53.686 --> 00:22:55.313
-Look.
-"Look"?

00:22:55.396 --> 00:22:56.647
Hey.

00:22:57.815 --> 00:22:59.483
Forget it. What did I expect?

00:22:59.567 --> 00:23:00.860
-I'm off.
-Don't go.

00:23:00.943 --> 00:23:02.028
Hye…

00:23:06.782 --> 00:23:08.075
Hye…

00:23:09.285 --> 00:23:10.828
Hye…

00:23:13.372 --> 00:23:14.457
Hye-suk.

00:23:30.139 --> 00:23:31.182
Hye-suk.

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:37.271
I like that.

00:23:38.481 --> 00:23:39.315
Let's sit.

00:23:39.982 --> 00:23:41.150
Hye-suk, sit.

00:23:41.901 --> 00:23:43.653
Don't do that. Just sit.

00:23:51.994 --> 00:23:54.080
COURAGE TO BE HATED

00:24:05.216 --> 00:24:08.177
I think I now know why you're so mad.

00:24:09.971 --> 00:24:12.390
Se-jin, you can hate me.

00:24:13.015 --> 00:24:16.435
Hate me all you want
until you don't feel angry anymore.

00:24:16.519 --> 00:24:18.980
And when the hatred is gone,

00:24:19.772 --> 00:24:21.148
I want you to come back.

00:24:59.687 --> 00:25:00.896
All right.

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:05.026
Ta-da.

00:25:06.193 --> 00:25:07.945
This is spicy sauce.

00:25:09.405 --> 00:25:11.073
This is kkakdugi.

00:25:12.283 --> 00:25:15.119
And this is beef brisket soup.

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:18.039
Why did you bring so many?

00:25:18.122 --> 00:25:21.125
Well, I was going
to teach you how to cook,

00:25:21.208 --> 00:25:24.420
but I think you have no talent for it.

00:25:25.004 --> 00:25:29.050
These days, deliveries take just a day,
so why bother?

00:25:30.009 --> 00:25:30.885
All right.

00:25:48.486 --> 00:25:49.320
It's good.

00:25:54.408 --> 00:25:55.868
This is what I'm talking about.

00:25:57.370 --> 00:25:59.455
But why the sudden side dish delivery?

00:26:04.001 --> 00:26:07.088
You know, you're going back to Seoul soon.

00:26:08.672 --> 00:26:10.966
It's already time.

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:14.637
Right now, if you call me,
I can run over in ten minutes.

00:26:15.304 --> 00:26:19.100
But when you're in Seoul, I can't.

00:26:19.975 --> 00:26:22.978
So, before you leave,

00:26:23.062 --> 00:26:26.649
I'm going to teach you
everything you need one by one.

00:26:27.608 --> 00:26:29.652
So I can be prepared for us
to be separated?

00:26:29.735 --> 00:26:30.820
Come on.

00:26:31.404 --> 00:26:33.739
The diameter of the Earth
is about 13,000 km.

00:26:33.823 --> 00:26:36.033
But we're within just 400 km.

00:26:36.117 --> 00:26:38.411
We won't be "separated."

00:26:38.494 --> 00:26:40.079
We will be still "connected."

00:26:41.705 --> 00:26:43.290
We may be far from each other,

00:26:43.374 --> 00:26:46.043
but my heart will be there
wherever you are.

00:26:46.961 --> 00:26:49.422
So don't cry
when you're out of side dishes.

00:26:49.505 --> 00:26:51.590
Don't starve, and call me anytime.

00:26:51.674 --> 00:26:56.011
Then I'll send nutrient-balanced
side dishes to your place right away.

00:27:01.016 --> 00:27:02.810
It has so much meat.

00:27:02.893 --> 00:27:04.645
-I'll boil it for you.
-Okay.

00:27:19.201 --> 00:27:20.369
Now, seat belt on.

00:27:22.455 --> 00:27:23.831
What am I preparing for?

00:27:24.832 --> 00:27:26.667
If you say you miss me,

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:29.086
I can throw everything aside
and run to you.

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:33.466
But some days,
you might miss me out of the blue.

00:27:33.549 --> 00:27:35.551
You should know how to drive for that.

00:27:37.303 --> 00:27:39.013
I understand your intention,

00:27:39.096 --> 00:27:41.223
but I haven't had an accident
in ten years.

00:27:41.932 --> 00:27:45.394
That's because
you haven't driven in ten years.

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:47.855
All right, turn the left blinker on.

00:27:52.151 --> 00:27:53.444
No. Here.

00:27:55.571 --> 00:27:56.906
Now, put it into drive.

00:27:56.989 --> 00:27:58.908
Gently step on the accelerator.

00:27:59.617 --> 00:28:02.578
Was it the right one or the left one?

00:28:04.205 --> 00:28:07.416
I'm sorry,
but let's just cancel this project.

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.335
Come on, I was kidding.

00:28:09.418 --> 00:28:11.295
Did you really think I didn't know?

00:28:13.214 --> 00:28:15.049
-It's the left one, right?
-The right one!

00:28:15.633 --> 00:28:17.510
No, the left one! The brake!

00:28:17.593 --> 00:28:18.719
-The right one.
-The brake!

00:28:18.802 --> 00:28:20.596
-The right one.
-The left one!

00:28:20.679 --> 00:28:22.848
-I'm not doing this!
-Don't you know left?

00:28:22.932 --> 00:28:24.642
-Left…
-No, the right one!

00:28:28.187 --> 00:28:29.063
Ms. Bom.

00:28:33.442 --> 00:28:35.653
What? What's going on?

00:28:36.362 --> 00:28:38.447
Weren't we going to practice driving?

00:28:38.531 --> 00:28:42.243
Well, I don't think
that's good for either of us.

00:28:42.326 --> 00:28:45.913
So, how about we do
something else starting today?

00:28:48.749 --> 00:28:52.211
Come to think of it,
we haven't taken many photos together.

00:28:52.294 --> 00:28:56.840
So I thought it'd be nice to record
our fond memories together with pictures.

00:28:57.758 --> 00:29:00.844
Then, wherever we are,
we'll feel like we're together.

00:29:02.054 --> 00:29:03.430
I'd love that.

00:29:03.514 --> 00:29:05.558
Right. I know where to go first.

00:29:06.225 --> 00:29:07.142
Where?

00:29:07.768 --> 00:29:09.228
Just follow me. Okay?

00:29:37.089 --> 00:29:38.424
They look beautiful.

00:29:42.928 --> 00:29:44.096
It looks good.

00:29:52.229 --> 00:29:53.355
Thank you.

00:29:53.439 --> 00:29:55.316
-Now, look at the camera.
-Camera.

00:29:55.399 --> 00:29:56.859
One, two, three.

00:29:56.942 --> 00:29:58.360
-Team White, let's go!
-Let's go!

00:30:00.279 --> 00:30:01.989
BOM-SIK'S HOUSE

00:30:03.949 --> 00:30:05.409
Looking good!

00:30:11.582 --> 00:30:13.083
Now, prepare to choke.

00:30:13.667 --> 00:30:14.585
Ready.

00:30:14.668 --> 00:30:15.753
Look there.

00:30:36.899 --> 00:30:40.027
If you did your best this time,
you must be first place.

00:30:40.861 --> 00:30:42.446
But it's okay if I lose now.

00:30:43.238 --> 00:30:45.532
Because I gave it my all,

00:30:46.408 --> 00:30:49.953
and if it wasn't enough,
then I should accept that.

00:30:50.996 --> 00:30:54.166
I won't hate you or myself.

00:30:54.249 --> 00:30:55.167
I won't either.

00:30:56.001 --> 00:30:59.505
I won't hate myself if I win,
and I won't hate you if I lose.

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:03.759
All right.

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:07.388
-Ladies first. I'll open mine first.
-Okay.

00:31:08.847 --> 00:31:10.474
REPORT CARD

00:31:14.353 --> 00:31:15.270
What?

00:31:15.354 --> 00:31:16.855
First place for everything?

00:31:19.149 --> 00:31:21.318
Did you mark number three
for every question again?

00:31:25.739 --> 00:31:27.282
You really did that again.

00:31:27.366 --> 00:31:29.243
Otherwise, why am I in first place?

00:31:33.122 --> 00:31:33.956
Second place?

00:31:36.375 --> 00:31:37.292
Second place?

00:31:38.001 --> 00:31:40.087
You did your best this time, didn't you?

00:31:43.799 --> 00:31:45.634
I want to go to college now, and…

00:31:47.886 --> 00:31:49.346
Choi Se-jin, you…

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:51.181
Don't contact me for a while.

00:31:52.349 --> 00:31:55.102
What? You said
you wouldn't hate me for it.

00:31:55.185 --> 00:31:56.395
You said it yourself.

00:31:56.979 --> 00:31:58.981
I'm going to focus on my studies now.

00:31:59.565 --> 00:32:00.941
-Get out of my way.
-What?

00:32:01.567 --> 00:32:03.861
You really are angry. Are you, babe?

00:32:03.944 --> 00:32:05.320
-Hey.
-Hello, ma'am.

00:32:05.404 --> 00:32:07.948
-Move.
-Hey, you can do it too.

00:32:08.449 --> 00:32:10.200
Should I solve the questions for you?

00:32:14.455 --> 00:32:16.832
Wow, it's finished.

00:32:19.877 --> 00:32:20.836
It's so pretty.

00:32:23.839 --> 00:32:25.424
You're really leaving tomorrow.

00:32:27.342 --> 00:32:28.802
Gosh, I am.

00:32:29.386 --> 00:32:31.180
Don't overwork at the new school.

00:32:31.764 --> 00:32:33.849
-I won't.
-Take medicine if you feel unwell.

00:32:34.433 --> 00:32:35.517
Okay.

00:32:35.601 --> 00:32:37.019
You remember the skills?

00:32:37.102 --> 00:32:39.354
If anyone harasses you, don't be scared.

00:32:39.438 --> 00:32:40.481
Just take them down and--

00:32:42.649 --> 00:32:46.028
Tomorrow, we'll be 400 km apart.
Are you going to just talk?

00:32:47.654 --> 00:32:50.449
Is there anything else to do?

00:32:54.077 --> 00:32:55.871
Anything else? Like what?

00:32:55.954 --> 00:32:56.997
Well…

00:32:58.207 --> 00:32:59.666
For instance…

00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:13.263
What you're doing right now,
it's very dangerous.

00:33:13.847 --> 00:33:16.433
It's our last night, so why not…

00:33:17.893 --> 00:33:19.478
be a little dangerous?

00:33:23.065 --> 00:33:24.149
Then I'll do…

00:33:25.526 --> 00:33:27.152
something dangerous starting now.

00:33:55.222 --> 00:33:56.348
Let's go!

00:34:10.237 --> 00:34:11.947
1 YEAR LATER

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:14.575
SEOUL MYEONGSEONG HIGH SCHOOL

00:34:29.882 --> 00:34:33.760
HAPPINESS

00:34:36.013 --> 00:34:36.847
Happiness.

00:34:38.056 --> 00:34:41.852
If you're asked why you want to be happy,

00:34:41.935 --> 00:34:43.562
how can you answer?

00:34:46.148 --> 00:34:47.316
Aristotle said,

00:34:47.399 --> 00:34:51.028
"The ultimate aim
of all human actions is happiness."

00:34:51.111 --> 00:34:53.447
Unlike Plato who advocated
for an ideal world,

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:57.743
Aristotle focused
on the real world we live in.

00:34:57.826 --> 00:35:00.746
Let's go to page 62
of Ethics and Thoughts.

00:35:10.255 --> 00:35:12.382
-My college friend at Munseong High...
-Yes.

00:35:12.466 --> 00:35:16.428
...said that she had an affair there.

00:35:17.137 --> 00:35:18.597
-Affair?
-Yes.

00:35:19.348 --> 00:35:20.766
She's Jeong Nan-hee's daughter?

00:35:21.808 --> 00:35:23.352
I knew it.

00:35:39.201 --> 00:35:40.035
Ms. Bom.

00:35:41.328 --> 00:35:42.871
Hi. How did it go?

00:35:45.791 --> 00:35:46.708
This is the ruling.

00:35:47.376 --> 00:35:48.460
Read it yourself.

00:35:49.962 --> 00:35:51.088
COURT OF KOREA

00:36:02.724 --> 00:36:04.601
PARTIES' CLAIMS AND FINDINGS

00:36:09.189 --> 00:36:13.068
DAMAGES FOR MENTAL DISTRESS

00:36:20.409 --> 00:36:25.205
KIM HYEON-JU IS LIABLE
TO COMPENSATE FOR THE ASSAULT

00:36:27.916 --> 00:36:31.169
You have done well all this time.

00:36:39.886 --> 00:36:40.762
What is this?

00:36:41.596 --> 00:36:44.099
It's the ruling for the adultery case
you mentioned.

00:36:44.683 --> 00:36:47.602
I'd like you to know
that I was being stalked

00:36:47.686 --> 00:36:48.937
and spread the word.

00:36:52.107 --> 00:36:55.318
Right, and you also talked about me
being Jeong Nan-hee's daughter.

00:36:55.902 --> 00:36:57.362
That one is true.

00:36:57.446 --> 00:36:59.489
And that's the secret to my beauty.

00:36:59.573 --> 00:37:02.451
Well, then. Have a nice day.

00:37:12.502 --> 00:37:16.006
The guest for today's
"Meet the Successful Professional"

00:37:16.089 --> 00:37:19.259
was selected by the students' vote.

00:37:19.342 --> 00:37:23.013
It is also the person who donated
a scholarship fund to our school

00:37:23.096 --> 00:37:24.973
to cultivate local talent.

00:37:25.599 --> 00:37:28.769
The one that
an overwhelming majority voted for!

00:37:28.852 --> 00:37:30.812
The CEO of JQ Energy,

00:37:30.896 --> 00:37:36.026
Sun Jae-gyu!

00:37:57.923 --> 00:37:59.466
Hello.

00:37:59.549 --> 00:38:01.927
I'm the CEO of JQ Energy,

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:04.721
but I'm better known
as Sun Han-gyul's uncle.

00:38:04.805 --> 00:38:06.098
I'm Sun Jae-gyu.

00:38:20.153 --> 00:38:24.407
What? Han-gyul's uncle is... that guy?

00:38:25.158 --> 00:38:27.619
Right, you were away
as an exchange teacher.

00:38:27.702 --> 00:38:30.997
God, look at how he's dressed.

00:38:31.081 --> 00:38:32.499
Is he really the CEO?

00:38:32.582 --> 00:38:36.294
He looks like a thug
that hangs around the market.

00:38:37.003 --> 00:38:39.589
That's what we also thought at first.

00:38:40.632 --> 00:38:43.844
But I heard a rumor
that he goes around lifting cars.

00:38:43.927 --> 00:38:45.053
That's right.

00:38:45.137 --> 00:38:47.514
He always sets an example
in the neighborhood.

00:38:48.431 --> 00:38:52.894
According to rumors,
he also shovels in the mountains at night.

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.814
He cares about every life.

00:38:55.897 --> 00:38:56.898
That's right.

00:38:57.524 --> 00:39:00.485
When the typhoon hit,
he took care of everyone.

00:39:01.194 --> 00:39:02.779
Right, Hye-suk?

00:39:02.863 --> 00:39:03.864
That's right.

00:39:03.947 --> 00:39:06.491
What's going on?
Why are you all defending him?

00:39:07.534 --> 00:39:09.035
You just wait and see.

00:39:09.661 --> 00:39:12.372
You'll see what we're talking about.

00:39:12.455 --> 00:39:14.416
But why isn't he saying anything?

00:39:38.773 --> 00:39:39.816
Goodness.

00:39:42.068 --> 00:39:45.780
First of all, to the students and teachers
who invited me here,

00:39:45.864 --> 00:39:47.866
I'm truly grateful.

00:39:50.619 --> 00:39:53.330
Now, let's begin the lecture.

00:39:55.916 --> 00:39:59.586
JQ Energy is not just a company
that produces electricity.

00:39:59.669 --> 00:40:02.589
It's a company that reads trends
and designs the future.

00:40:02.672 --> 00:40:04.341
And today,

00:40:04.424 --> 00:40:08.053
we'll talk about how the energy industry
is changing in this AI era,

00:40:08.136 --> 00:40:13.099
especially what kind of role
renewable energy plays in the change.

00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:17.020
BOM BOM BOM

00:40:30.492 --> 00:40:31.618
By the way, Mr. Choi,

00:40:32.327 --> 00:40:34.079
are you really not moving your office?

00:40:34.788 --> 00:40:35.830
Right.

00:40:35.914 --> 00:40:38.792
Why are you still there?
There's nothing there.

00:40:38.875 --> 00:40:40.210
What do you mean, nothing?

00:40:40.293 --> 00:40:42.003
The most important thing is there.

00:40:43.421 --> 00:40:44.798
What's there?

00:40:46.549 --> 00:40:47.425
Well…

00:40:49.427 --> 00:40:50.387
A friend?

00:40:54.099 --> 00:40:55.350
JAE-GYU

00:40:57.435 --> 00:40:59.104
-Mr. Sun!
-Ms. Bom!

00:41:00.063 --> 00:41:02.857
I couldn't answer your calls
because of the lecture.

00:41:03.358 --> 00:41:05.110
It's so noisy here, so I…

00:41:05.193 --> 00:41:06.695
It's Ms. Bom!

00:41:06.778 --> 00:41:08.530
Han-gyul's uncle

00:41:08.613 --> 00:41:13.159
donated a scholarship fund
to our school, so I'm treating him!

00:41:17.372 --> 00:41:18.665
Goodness.

00:41:19.332 --> 00:41:21.543
Being here brings back memories.

00:41:22.502 --> 00:41:24.254
Anyway, why did you call so many times?

00:41:24.337 --> 00:41:25.922
Did you miss me that much?

00:41:27.757 --> 00:41:29.509
I got the ruling today.

00:41:29.592 --> 00:41:31.386
I wanted to tell you I won.

00:41:31.469 --> 00:41:32.387
Really?

00:41:33.388 --> 00:41:34.931
See? What did I tell you?

00:41:35.015 --> 00:41:37.767
I-jun can be a jerk sometimes,
but he's a good lawyer.

00:41:37.851 --> 00:41:39.102
He was a great student.

00:41:40.478 --> 00:41:42.355
Who are you calling a jerk, punk?

00:41:42.439 --> 00:41:44.399
-Did you hear that?
-Yes, I did.

00:41:45.483 --> 00:41:49.195
Geez, what are you doing here?

00:41:49.863 --> 00:41:53.700
Hang up already and come drink with me.

00:41:54.284 --> 00:41:58.038
Leaving bad blood between us behind

00:41:58.121 --> 00:42:00.457
There was no bad blood.
Let me talk to her more.

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:01.541
Goodness.

00:42:02.167 --> 00:42:04.377
-Ms. Bom.
-Mr. Hong, how have you been?

00:42:04.461 --> 00:42:06.546
Mr. Sun is pretty drunk.

00:42:06.629 --> 00:42:08.673
Call him some other time.

00:42:08.757 --> 00:42:10.216
-Let's go.
-Wait. Ms. Bom.

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:12.177
You drive me crazy!

00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:14.262
-Sun Jae-gyu.
-My shoes…

00:42:14.346 --> 00:42:17.724
You've settled in my heart!

00:42:18.308 --> 00:42:20.226
No, Mr. Hong. Hold on.

00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:23.188
Hello? Mr. Sun! Jae-gyu!

00:42:23.271 --> 00:42:24.356
Stop it.

00:42:24.439 --> 00:42:25.732
-Stop.
-No, Mom. Hold on.

00:42:25.815 --> 00:42:27.859
Yes. We should make a toast too.

00:42:27.942 --> 00:42:28.777
All right.

00:42:29.736 --> 00:42:32.572
Congratulations on Yoon Bom's win.

00:42:33.656 --> 00:42:35.784
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

00:42:35.867 --> 00:42:38.036
-Congratulations!
-Thank you!

00:42:44.501 --> 00:42:48.713
I've sold the land,
and the paperwork's all done.

00:42:51.716 --> 00:42:52.675
Then what is it?

00:42:59.391 --> 00:43:02.727
I wanted to pay for Han-gyul's tuition.

00:43:05.855 --> 00:43:07.982
I don't know if he's quick-witted

00:43:08.942 --> 00:43:10.443
or if he's matured early,

00:43:12.112 --> 00:43:14.447
but he's never contacted me since then.

00:43:17.117 --> 00:43:21.538
I can pay for his tuition too,
so do something I can't do for him.

00:43:22.664 --> 00:43:23.540
Like what?

00:43:25.125 --> 00:43:25.959
A picture.

00:43:30.213 --> 00:43:31.923
Whenever he started school,

00:43:32.006 --> 00:43:34.509
it was always just me and him
at the entrance ceremony.

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:37.095
He didn't say it,

00:43:37.929 --> 00:43:39.722
but I could see it in his eyes.

00:43:41.433 --> 00:43:44.269
He envied his friends
who were taking photos

00:43:44.936 --> 00:43:48.398
with their moms, dads,
and other family members.

00:43:52.235 --> 00:43:54.487
Let's do that
at his college entrance ceremony.

00:43:55.947 --> 00:43:58.491
Let's get him flowers
and take pictures with him.

00:44:01.661 --> 00:44:02.829
For Han-gyul,

00:44:04.205 --> 00:44:05.915
I'm sure that's the best present.

00:44:29.939 --> 00:44:31.983
Gosh, I miss him so much!

00:44:42.869 --> 00:44:45.413
If one day, out of the blue,

00:44:45.497 --> 00:44:48.208
you ever find yourself really missing me,
open it then.

00:44:52.337 --> 00:44:53.880
How much do I miss him now?

00:44:55.048 --> 00:44:56.966
Beep, beep. It's 100%.

00:44:58.843 --> 00:45:00.678
Then I should open it.

00:45:01.596 --> 00:45:04.140
Yes, Bom. Let's open it.

00:45:09.229 --> 00:45:12.065
I've gained some weight.
What if it doesn't fit?

00:45:14.442 --> 00:45:15.527
No.

00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:18.112
Sun Jae-gyu is not someone
that predictable.

00:45:18.196 --> 00:45:20.240
So I'm sure it's not a ring.

00:45:20.323 --> 00:45:22.617
But it'll be

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:25.828
something sparkly and shiny
that'll make me…

00:45:29.624 --> 00:45:32.585
Hey, Sun Jae-gyu!

00:45:37.924 --> 00:45:39.634
He thinks this is a gift?

00:45:40.176 --> 00:45:42.887
I've been holding myself
from opening it for this?

00:45:43.471 --> 00:45:44.514
Darn it.

00:46:50.538 --> 00:46:52.540
Geez, Ms. Bom.

00:46:56.169 --> 00:46:57.045
Ms. Bom…

00:47:06.137 --> 00:47:07.889
This darn lawyer…

00:47:08.473 --> 00:47:10.975
I thought it was her, darn it.

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:13.227
Gosh, my head.

00:47:17.482 --> 00:47:19.359
For crying out loud!

00:47:22.278 --> 00:47:23.237
What the...

00:47:24.781 --> 00:47:27.116
Goodness, my head.

00:47:28.117 --> 00:47:29.535
You threw me off again?

00:47:29.619 --> 00:47:31.537
How many times is this?

00:47:31.621 --> 00:47:35.333
You barge in with some pork belly
and sleep here whenever you want.

00:47:35.416 --> 00:47:38.211
When did I say it was okay
for you to sleep here?

00:47:39.295 --> 00:47:40.838
You ungrateful bastard.

00:47:40.922 --> 00:47:43.675
You got a place to live
and raised Han-gyul with my money.

00:47:43.758 --> 00:47:45.134
And you can't do this for me?

00:47:45.218 --> 00:47:47.804
Goodness.
I think I've done enough, so leave.

00:47:47.887 --> 00:47:49.055
I have to go out.

00:47:49.138 --> 00:47:50.723
Gosh, I'm so sick of this.

00:47:50.807 --> 00:47:53.267
Why can't you just stay home?
Where are you going?

00:47:54.686 --> 00:47:55.561
Jae-gyu.

00:47:57.563 --> 00:47:59.399
Sun Jae-gyu, where are you going?

00:48:22.171 --> 00:48:24.257
Ms. Bom, when did you get here?

00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:25.174
What…

00:48:26.342 --> 00:48:27.927
Why are you coming from there?

00:48:28.678 --> 00:48:30.722
-Where's Sun Jae-gyu?
-Jae-gyu?

00:48:31.472 --> 00:48:36.436
Well, I bet he's having
the hardest time in his life.

00:48:41.441 --> 00:48:45.278
Now, the panel consists
of P-type and N-type semiconductors,

00:48:45.361 --> 00:48:48.030
and electrons and holes
in the photoelectric effect

00:48:48.114 --> 00:48:50.700
diffuse towards each other
in a p-n junction.

00:48:50.783 --> 00:48:53.786
It causes a potential difference,
and if an external circuit

00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:55.079
-is connected…
-Mr. Gu.

00:48:55.663 --> 00:48:56.706
It's…

00:48:57.749 --> 00:48:58.875
Director Gu. What?

00:48:58.958 --> 00:49:00.960
I don't understand anything you say.

00:49:01.043 --> 00:49:02.920
Can you translate it into Korean?

00:49:03.504 --> 00:49:06.841
You've been working part-time for a while.
You still don't understand?

00:49:06.924 --> 00:49:09.594
How are you going
to get a job here like this?

00:49:09.677 --> 00:49:12.305
Sun Han-gyul,
the crown prince of JQ Energy,

00:49:12.388 --> 00:49:14.932
is abandoning the company
to go to college.

00:49:15.016 --> 00:49:17.310
Who will fill the gap except for us?

00:49:19.979 --> 00:49:23.566
Gosh, you guys are
also poor in character, not just in skill.

00:49:23.649 --> 00:49:27.403
This is why I told the boss
not to hire you so many times.

00:49:27.487 --> 00:49:30.281
Forget it. Just move that one. Go!

00:49:35.328 --> 00:49:37.622
Am I seeing things because I'm exhausted?

00:49:38.539 --> 00:49:39.957
Isn't that Ms. Bom?

00:49:40.041 --> 00:49:41.334
-Ms. Bom!
-Ms. Bom!

00:49:44.253 --> 00:49:45.838
-Ms. Bom!
-Ms. Bom!

00:49:45.922 --> 00:49:47.215
Guys!

00:49:47.298 --> 00:49:50.176
Dae-han and Min-guk,
you're really working part-time here?

00:49:50.259 --> 00:49:51.302
Ms. Yoon.

00:49:52.303 --> 00:49:53.763
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:49:54.597 --> 00:49:56.557
You did such a good job.

00:49:56.641 --> 00:49:59.811
While teaching these two how to work here,

00:49:59.894 --> 00:50:03.731
I realized how hard
it must've been for you.

00:50:04.649 --> 00:50:06.275
By the way, what brings you here?

00:50:06.859 --> 00:50:09.737
Right. I came to see Mr. Sun.

00:50:09.821 --> 00:50:12.990
Uncle… No, Mr. Sun went out
to go to the market earlier.

00:50:13.074 --> 00:50:14.408
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

00:50:15.201 --> 00:50:16.536
Then why won't he pick up?

00:50:16.619 --> 00:50:17.703
Oh, right.

00:50:18.996 --> 00:50:20.498
He left his phone here.

00:50:21.165 --> 00:50:22.750
If you see him, give it to him.

00:50:29.382 --> 00:50:30.216
Okay.

00:50:33.386 --> 00:50:35.972
Once the entrance ceremony is over,

00:50:36.055 --> 00:50:38.558
we'll go to the salt bread bakery
and wait in line,

00:50:38.641 --> 00:50:40.268
then take pictures at Seoul Forest

00:50:40.351 --> 00:50:43.354
and move to the cart bar street
in Eulmi-ro in the evening.

00:50:43.437 --> 00:50:45.481
We'll have beer with fish cake soup.

00:50:45.565 --> 00:50:49.068
Hey, what kind of date
is so tightly scheduled?

00:50:49.735 --> 00:50:53.281
We'll attend the same lectures
in the same college. We'll meet every day.

00:50:57.118 --> 00:50:59.912
Since we'll see each other every day,
let's take it slow.

00:50:59.996 --> 00:51:01.747
Let's go to Hangang Park again

00:51:01.831 --> 00:51:03.541
and go to see Ms. Bom too.

00:51:04.917 --> 00:51:06.043
Gosh, where is he?

00:51:07.295 --> 00:51:09.589
Hey, we can see Ms. Bom right now.

00:51:10.506 --> 00:51:11.340
Ms. Bom.

00:51:13.676 --> 00:51:15.303
Guys!

00:51:15.386 --> 00:51:16.679
You've gotten so pretty.

00:51:17.805 --> 00:51:19.765
-How have you been?
-Good.

00:51:19.849 --> 00:51:22.768
We were just talking about
how we'd go see you in Seoul.

00:51:22.852 --> 00:51:25.521
Really? When is
your entrance ceremony again?

00:51:25.605 --> 00:51:27.523
-Can I go there?
-Of course.

00:51:27.607 --> 00:51:29.400
This entrance ceremony will be crowded.

00:51:30.359 --> 00:51:32.153
Anyway, what brought you down here?

00:51:32.737 --> 00:51:34.363
To see Han-gyul's uncle?

00:51:35.948 --> 00:51:38.284
Right, I heard your uncle was here.

00:51:38.367 --> 00:51:41.621
He was, but he just went to the dojo
with the jiu jitsu people.

00:51:42.246 --> 00:51:43.122
What?

00:51:49.045 --> 00:51:50.671
Hye-suk, next week, let's…

00:51:51.589 --> 00:51:52.423
No.

00:51:52.965 --> 00:51:56.761
Except for the way you address me,
nothing's changed.

00:51:57.386 --> 00:51:59.847
Seafood stew, gamja-tang,
sundae-guk and naengmyeon.

00:51:59.931 --> 00:52:01.933
How can you eat Korean food all the time?

00:52:02.642 --> 00:52:04.393
That's why we'll go to a hotel…

00:52:05.686 --> 00:52:06.604
A hotel?

00:52:06.687 --> 00:52:07.980
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:52:08.064 --> 00:52:11.108
I got a family room
so that we can bring the twins too.

00:52:16.197 --> 00:52:17.740
The twins can't go.

00:52:18.282 --> 00:52:19.116
Why not?

00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:20.618
Don't ask.

00:52:20.701 --> 00:52:23.579
Whether it's a family room
or a honeymoon room,

00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:25.539
I'll go.

00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:30.670
People are watching.

00:52:32.922 --> 00:52:33.839
Ms. Bom!

00:52:33.923 --> 00:52:36.300
-Oh, attention! Hello, ma'am!
-Hello, ma'am!

00:52:36.384 --> 00:52:37.385
Hello.

00:52:38.010 --> 00:52:39.178
How have you been?

00:52:39.261 --> 00:52:40.262
Hey, Ms. Bom.

00:52:40.346 --> 00:52:41.639
Oh, Ms. Seo!

00:52:41.722 --> 00:52:43.724
Ms. Bom, I'm a blue belt now.

00:52:43.808 --> 00:52:45.768
Oh, really? Congrats, Dong-pyo!

00:52:46.811 --> 00:52:48.771
What? Mr. Hong?

00:52:50.481 --> 00:52:51.732
Hi, Ms. Bom.

00:52:51.816 --> 00:52:54.110
Oh, you work out here too?

00:52:54.193 --> 00:52:56.612
Geez, what's the point, though?

00:52:56.696 --> 00:52:58.739
He's not getting better at all.

00:52:58.823 --> 00:53:02.618
You can't even do an armbar.
How will you win the sports festival?

00:53:02.702 --> 00:53:06.122
I'm just pretending.
I'm hiding the skill for the day.

00:53:06.205 --> 00:53:07.790
Besides, at the next festival,

00:53:07.873 --> 00:53:10.459
there won't be Sun Jae-gyu
since Han-gyul 's graduated.

00:53:10.543 --> 00:53:12.086
So I stand a chance.

00:53:12.169 --> 00:53:13.254
I'm sorry,

00:53:13.921 --> 00:53:17.883
but where is the Sun Jae-gyu
you're talking about?

00:53:18.467 --> 00:53:20.011
I've been looking for him,

00:53:20.594 --> 00:53:21.971
and I'm getting tired.

00:53:22.471 --> 00:53:26.100
Oh, if you go to the beach,
you'll definitely meet him.

00:53:26.183 --> 00:53:27.977
Where you had your first date.

00:53:54.712 --> 00:53:55.921
Mr. Sun?

00:53:58.007 --> 00:53:59.592
You're here, Ms. Bom?

00:54:02.970 --> 00:54:05.306
Why do you look so handsome…

00:54:08.517 --> 00:54:10.436
I mean, why do you look like a model…

00:54:13.189 --> 00:54:15.441
I mean, why are you going around so much?

00:54:16.067 --> 00:54:18.611
And what's with the suit?
Is today a special day?

00:54:20.029 --> 00:54:22.031
Any day, any moment,

00:54:22.114 --> 00:54:25.868
I thought you might come see me,
so I've been wearing this all the time.

00:54:27.244 --> 00:54:28.162
What?

00:54:32.291 --> 00:54:33.125
30 MINUTES AGO

00:54:33.209 --> 00:54:35.961
Are you cuddling or what?
Do it properly. Like this!

00:54:37.421 --> 00:54:39.298
Master, my phone's ringing.

00:54:39.381 --> 00:54:41.008
-Your phone? Go take it.
-Yes.

00:54:41.759 --> 00:54:43.010
Come on.

00:54:43.094 --> 00:54:44.220
Pull it.

00:54:45.763 --> 00:54:46.931
Hello?

00:54:48.224 --> 00:54:50.893
What? Ms. Bom is here?

00:54:54.313 --> 00:54:55.397
What did you say?

00:54:56.524 --> 00:54:58.192
Ms. Bom is here?

00:54:59.193 --> 00:55:01.904
She's looking everywhere for you
right now.

00:55:02.655 --> 00:55:05.407
Han-gyul told her you were here,
so she's on the way.

00:55:05.491 --> 00:55:06.909
Here?

00:55:11.205 --> 00:55:14.208
But he said she looked furious.

00:55:14.291 --> 00:55:17.169
She looked like she'd confront you.

00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:19.547
I wonder what's wrong.

00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:20.631
Why would she…

00:55:25.386 --> 00:55:26.428
Oh, right.

00:55:27.763 --> 00:55:29.932
Hey, I think I know why.

00:55:30.015 --> 00:55:32.226
She's on the way. Where are you going?

00:55:32.309 --> 00:55:33.477
To the beach.

00:55:34.145 --> 00:55:36.188
-The beach?
-Listen, when she comes,

00:55:36.272 --> 00:55:38.732
tell her to come to the beach
where we had our first date.

00:55:38.816 --> 00:55:40.025
Tell her to take her time.

00:55:40.109 --> 00:55:41.443
I'm leaving. Good luck!

00:55:41.527 --> 00:55:42.403
Work hard!

00:55:42.486 --> 00:55:44.572
-Good luck!
-Good luck!

00:55:49.076 --> 00:55:51.203
You think I'll be fooled again?

00:55:52.830 --> 00:55:54.039
Fooled? I…

00:55:54.999 --> 00:55:57.418
You told me not to wear this
around other women,

00:55:57.501 --> 00:56:00.588
so I didn't even wear it at the lecture.
I've been saving it.

00:56:03.048 --> 00:56:04.383
Then what on earth is this?

00:56:11.849 --> 00:56:15.144
I thought it might be
something expensive or romantic,

00:56:15.227 --> 00:56:16.687
so I didn't let Bom-sik touch it.

00:56:16.770 --> 00:56:19.356
I even risked my life for it
during the typhoon.

00:56:19.982 --> 00:56:22.693
Whenever I missed you,
I thought of opening it.

00:56:22.776 --> 00:56:25.321
I hesitated and hesitated,
and I finally opened it.

00:56:25.905 --> 00:56:29.575
All that waiting and missing you
was for this gas-station giveaway gift?

00:56:32.912 --> 00:56:35.080
Is this funny to you?

00:56:35.164 --> 00:56:38.292
Gosh, just as I expected.

00:56:39.376 --> 00:56:42.588
I knew you'd come see me
all furious once you opened it.

00:56:43.756 --> 00:56:44.840
What?

00:56:46.383 --> 00:56:47.218
Ms. Bom.

00:56:47.843 --> 00:56:51.305
That arm sleeve is not just a free gift.

00:56:52.681 --> 00:56:53.682
To me,

00:56:55.184 --> 00:56:57.228
it's more special than anything.

00:56:58.729 --> 00:57:00.314
Before I met you,

00:57:02.316 --> 00:57:04.902
I always tried to cover this scar.

00:57:05.486 --> 00:57:10.866
I didn't have the courage to look at it,
so I always covered it with that sleeve.

00:57:12.159 --> 00:57:13.786
But after I met you,

00:57:14.411 --> 00:57:18.958
for the first time,
I felt like I didn't have to hide it.

00:57:21.752 --> 00:57:24.630
I couldn't do it on my own.
You helped me overcome it.

00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:33.806
If that's the case,
I'll keep it safe for you.

00:57:36.809 --> 00:57:38.769
What? What are you doing?

00:57:39.979 --> 00:57:44.191
Goodness. It's been so hard
carrying this in my pocket every day.

00:57:45.276 --> 00:57:47.236
I've been carrying this in my pocket

00:57:47.319 --> 00:57:49.238
for the day you'd come see me like this.

00:57:49.738 --> 00:57:52.157
And that day has finally come.

00:58:02.793 --> 00:58:05.254
My heart was as cold as winter,

00:58:05.838 --> 00:58:08.882
and you came to me like warm spring,
my lovely Bom.

00:58:08.966 --> 00:58:11.218
Whether it's cold or hot,

00:58:11.302 --> 00:58:14.346
I'll be your man
who is always there for you.

00:58:16.181 --> 00:58:18.767
If that arm sleeve is a symbol
of our memories,

00:58:18.851 --> 00:58:21.729
this ring will be a symbol
of our future together…

00:58:25.607 --> 00:58:26.900
What?

00:58:27.568 --> 00:58:29.320
I didn't even say half of my line.

00:58:30.487 --> 00:58:32.239
Whatever you say,

00:58:32.906 --> 00:58:34.450
my answer is yes.

00:58:58.265 --> 00:58:59.933
We should get married in spring.

00:59:00.017 --> 00:59:01.518
And have three kids.

00:59:01.602 --> 00:59:03.645
The snack bar lady said sons are no good.

00:59:03.729 --> 00:59:04.897
Then three daughters?

00:59:05.689 --> 00:59:08.233
Should we get our first home
in Seoul or here?

00:59:10.277 --> 00:59:12.571
Wherever it is and whenever it is,

00:59:13.113 --> 00:59:14.448
the one beside me...

00:59:16.867 --> 00:59:17.951
will be you.

01:00:29.064 --> 01:00:30.149
BOM LOVES JAE-GYU
