00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,220
=Episode 22=
(This story is purely fictional)

4
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,670
Everyone is here?

5
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,670
Let me make the introductions.

6
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,270
He

7
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,270
is Lawrence.

8
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,740
Mr. Law.

9
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,460
And this is the renowned director,
Director Zhuang Dace.

10
00:02:17,457 --> 00:02:18,300
Director Zhuang.

11
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,670
Mr. Law, I have long admired you.

12
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,300
This is the screenwriter of our show,

13
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,580
and the head of Feihuang Pictures,
Huang Sibo.

14
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:26,950
Mr. Law.

15
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:27,550
Yellow.

16
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,670
I really admire your work.

17
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,270
Mr. Ma. Have some water and have a rest.

18
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,270
No, it won't be necessary.

19
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,390
Ocean, there is really no need.

20
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,700
After all, today you are a bit...

21
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,510
You know?

22
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,070
I know.

23
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,230
Mr. Ma's motion sickness today

24
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,740
is quite serious.

25
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,740
I was not like this before.

26
00:02:46,013 --> 00:02:47,300
Maybe today, it is because of

27
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,270
this aircraft model...

28
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:50,830
Mr. Ma.

29
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:52,550
Mr. Ma.

30
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,510
I do not care who he is.

31
00:02:58,568 --> 00:02:59,813
A set visit is just a set visit.

32
00:02:59,857 --> 00:03:01,230
Have a drink and leave.

33
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,746
Why should he use my makeup artist?

34
00:03:02,746 --> 00:03:03,350
Careful.

35
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:05,550
Mr. Lu.

36
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,550
Mr. Lu.

37
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,020
The entire crew is waiting.

38
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,620
Can he afford to delay everyone?

39
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,390
Mr. Lu.

40
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,740
(Mr. Lu Zhiyao's Private Makeup Room)

41
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,390
This way.

42
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,580
The wind messed it up a bit.

43
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,020
Please fix it again.

44
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:20,950
Thank you.

45
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,670
Who is this?

46
00:03:23,724 --> 00:03:24,890
Why is he sitting in my seat?

47
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:27,460
Mr. Law.

48
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,020
Mr. Law.

49
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,550
This is our male lead.

50
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,550
Mr. Lu Zhiyao.

51
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,460
Mr. Lu.

52
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,580
This is from Tengda,

53
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,550
Mr. Lawrence.

54
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:35,860
Hi.

55
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,420
Nice to meet you.

56
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,950
Lu?

57
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,830
Do you have an English name?

58
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:44,620
(Sima Fu)
My hair is quite soft,

59
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,110
so spray a bit more hairspray.

60
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,070
Mr. Lawrence.

61
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,620
What's up?

62
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:58,510
We have been waiting day and night
for you to arrive at last.

63
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,230
You have no idea how much we missed you.

64
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,110
We were really hoping you would come.

65
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,070
Really?

66
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,900
Yeah.

67
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:13,950
Yeah.

68
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,350
- Wishing us a successful start.
- Wishing us a successful start.

69
00:04:18,435 --> 00:04:19,940
Now, let us welcome our producer,

70
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,180
Mr. Sima Fu,

71
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,500
to the stage for a speech.

72
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,260
(Northern Continent.
Wishing a Successful Launch)

73
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,710
Thanks to Qisheng
for hydration and moisture.

74
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,110
Qishenghua, the skincare brand
that pioneered

75
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,910
herbal skincare.

76
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,910
Thanks to Zhiguang
for myopia prevention.

77
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,110
Thanks to Ziguang, the lighting brand

78
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,910
that pioneered
purple light eye protection.

79
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,820
Thanks to Xiquan
for the healthy drinking water.

80
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,350
Thanks to Yuanxin
for formaldehyde-free living.

81
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,590
Thanks to Kelin
for the beauty in full bloom.

82
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,710
Many thanks

83
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,150
to all those who support us,

84
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,820
our eighty-three sponsors.

85
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,380
Did I hear that right?

86
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,590
We have eighty-three brands?

87
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,150
So he is not here

88
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,590
to interfere with the old project.

89
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,350
He is here to place new brands.

90
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,910
Wait, are all eighty-three brands

91
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,470
being placed into our show?

92
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,470
I believe

93
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,030
we will definitely surpass

94
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,910
Universal Studios.

95
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,350
Let me ask something.

96
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,150
Who is he?

97
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,790
No idea.

98
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,300
Why is my umbrella shading him?

99
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,590
It is extremely hot today.

100
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,910
Thank you all very much.

101
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,150
Now, let us get back to this project.

102
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,790
From the early stage,

103
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,710
the writing and polishing of the script,

104
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,710
to the later casting decisions,

105
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,457
including when we
decided to start filming,

106
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,029
and even the future production process,

107
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,810
I believe it will all
be a difficult journey.

108
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,590
I think everyone gathered here...

109
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,380
If I were to present
Her Highness Qishenghua's

110
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,710
Hydra Lock Moisture Radiance Mask,

111
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,710
how would you respond?

112
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:41,710
Wait.

113
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,550
Stop.

114
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,350
What kind of lines are these?

115
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,790
Where is the screenwriter?

116
00:05:45,924 --> 00:05:47,380
Have the screenwriter come over.

117
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,260
Coming.

118
00:05:50,013 --> 00:05:51,470
What is going on with these lines?

119
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,150
What is wrong?

120
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,550
What is going on with your lines?

121
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,590
Do not tell me this was demanded
by the brand.

122
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,590
You are the screenwriter.

123
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,030
If others tell you
to change it and you obey,

124
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,350
then what are you even writing for?

125
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,620
Exactly, Screenwriter.

126
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,030
Can you not have at least
some artistic principles of your own?

127
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:03,470
Right?

128
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:03,910
Yes.

129
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:05,910
This will not do.

130
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:06,590
Exactly.

131
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:07,940
This really will not do.

132
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,380
Everyone, am I right?

133
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,670
- Yes.
- Yes.

134
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:11,820
See?

135
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,260
Fine.

136
00:06:17,013 --> 00:06:18,350
I will revise it right away.

137
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,230
Fine.

138
00:06:22,991 --> 00:06:24,030
Technical adjustment.

139
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,524
Everyone, take a short break.

140
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,300
Hello.

141
00:06:30,302 --> 00:06:31,550
What is going on with you all?

142
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,790
What happened?

143
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,470
- Mr. Law...
- Mr. Law...

144
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:38,300
- He is driving us to the brink.
- He is driving us to the brink.

145
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,380
Wait.

146
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,590
Isn't Mr. Law doing a set inspection?

147
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,180
How is that affecting you over there?

148
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,150
Mr. Pei.

149
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,060
Before he went to visit the set,

150
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,740
he also arranged work

151
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,710
to insert brand advertising
into the game.

152
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:52,380
Lv worked overtime until he collapsed.

153
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,350
Is Lv all right?

154
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,940
Yes, he is fine now.

155
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,590
The doctor said

156
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,820
he is still young,

157
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,060
and severely sleep-deprived.

158
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,820
Lv, come on.

159
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,790
Say hello.

160
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,620
Say hello.

161
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,380
Mr. Pei.

162
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,060
Mr. Pei, I am fine.

163
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,790
I just need to sleep a bit.

164
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,380
Then, let him rest a little longer.

165
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,380
Let him rest.

166
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,260
All right.

167
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,940
During this period,

168
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,740
if anything happens,

169
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,940
inform me immediately.

170
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,260
The afternoon is off.

171
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,740
Everyone goes for a medical checkup.

172
00:07:23,746 --> 00:07:25,260
Any issues will count as work injuries.

173
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,368
The company will cover it.

174
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,350
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

175
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,470
But we cannot take time off.

176
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,940
Mr. Law said that,

177
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,990
even if he is not at Tengda,

178
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,420
he will still hold video meetings
to review the work.

179
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,550
Mr. Pei,

180
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,740
what are we supposed
to do if this keeps up?

181
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,790
(Unknowingly,)

182
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,590
(the nightmare
of life is repeating itself.)

183
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,910
(In the past, because of Mr. Law,)

184
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,110
(and his special business ties
with Tengda,)

185
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,030
(I gave him face,)

186
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,500
(and let everyone suffer.)

187
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,230
(Now that it has come to this...)

188
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,820
It is time to use my trump card.

189
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,380
I will send you a document.

Hurry.

202
00:08:30,902 --> 00:08:32,380
Mr. Law is calling a video meeting.

No problem, Mr. Law.

206
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,790
Any ideas you have,
feel free to raise them.

207
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,110
We guarantee we will get it done.

208
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,380
About how long will it take to finish?

209
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,350
We still need to discuss it.

210
00:08:51,391 --> 00:08:53,013
Then how long will the discussion take?

211
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,740
How about we discuss it first

212
00:08:55,746 --> 00:08:57,124
and get back to you afterward?

Anti Law Work Guide, second principle.

214
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,260
Make an effort,

215
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,540
but still cannot do it.

216
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,500
Lawrence, here is the situation.

217
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,140
The game development process

218
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,620
cannot be quantified.

219
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,620
However, we

220
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,430
are already improving process
based management

221
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,540
and resource integration,

222
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,740
doing everything we can

223
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:18,780
to em...

224
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,020
Em...

225
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,860
Empower the product...

226
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,350
That is feasible...

227
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,140
Within the three months you requested,

228
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,620
we can integrate
all potentially viable plans.

229
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,190
Integrate.

230
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,860
This arrives at the current

231
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,620
optimal solution.

232
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,780
Yes.

233
00:09:38,813 --> 00:09:40,020
Your eyesight is not great.

234
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,724
You should get yourself
a pair of glasses.

235
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,900
Alright.

236
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,620
What you are talking
about is the process,

237
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,900
but what I want is the outcome.

238
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,310
Result.

239
00:09:52,835 --> 00:09:53,990
What I just said was that

240
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,190
we have found the optimal solution
for the current situation.

241
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,629
We are now shifting
the focus of our work

242
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,740
to improving process-based management
and resource integration,

243
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,990
overcoming the challenge that

244
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,260
game development cannot be quantified,

245
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,540
and striving to follow your plan

246
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,540
to complete the integration

247
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,310
of all potential solutions
within three months,

248
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,900
thereby empowering the product.

249
00:10:07,924 --> 00:10:09,310
That sounds much more professional.

250
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,950
I totally understand now.

251
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:12,590
Anyway,

252
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,020
could you go into more detail

253
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,260
about how you will ensure that the game

254
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,740
becomes a hit after launch?

255
00:10:18,635 --> 00:10:20,524
We will roll out
full funnel deep marketing,

256
00:10:20,568 --> 00:10:21,740
using a matrix-based strategy,

257
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,540
to create a brand new
value conversion model.

258
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,780
Perfect.

259
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,740
Exactly what I had in mind.

260
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:29,900
Proceed.

261
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:30,900
Alright.

262
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,020
Alright.

263
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,860
Mr. Pei is really something.

264
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,020
Where did he
even learn all these tricks?

265
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,070
Let me tell you,

266
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,380
someone like Mr. Pei,

267
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,780
who has survived both Fuhui
and Sky Fire,

268
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,990
is rare these days.

269
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,190
He even teaches us personally,

270
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,620
without worrying that one day,

271
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,013
we might use these tricks on him.

272
00:10:51,324 --> 00:10:52,590
These skills are probably just

273
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,140
the tip of the iceberg for Mr. Pei.

274
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,140
(Tengda Games)

275
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,900
Mr. Pei.

276
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,260
This...

277
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,020
Mr. Pei.

278
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,260
You are finally back.

279
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,540
While you were away,

280
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,470
we really relied on

281
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,524
the Anti Law Work Guide

282
00:11:15,546 --> 00:11:16,900
you gave us.

283
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,260
It was truly effective.

284
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,660
We all owe you our thanks.

285
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,380
Save the thanks

286
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,070
for later.

287
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,260
Is this helicopter
really that nauseating?

288
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:27,900
Mr. Pei.

289
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,190
Mr. Pei.

290
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,310
Over here.

291
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,380
Mr. Pei. You need to come take a look.

292
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,020
Sima and Mr. Ma are arguing.

293
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,260
Ma Fu. Let me make this clear.

294
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,950
It was Mr. Pei who told me to hold back.

295
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:38,740
I am not afraid of you.

296
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,500
What did you just call me?

297
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,380
I called you Ma Fu.

298
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,620
Say that again!

299
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,260
Ma...

300
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,140
So what?

301
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,260
Loss.

302
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,740
You know how much effort it took
to secure this client.

303
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,140
We have to take

304
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,740
this case.

305
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,900
We cannot.

306
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,380
This case clearly states

307
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,500
that I must hand over
all my social media accounts.

308
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,620
And most importantly,

309
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,430
this case

310
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,780
forbids me from dating.

311
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,020
No relationships at all.

312
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,780
Even Lu Zhiyao is allowed to date.

313
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,500
Why am I not?

314
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,260
Is that so?

315
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,620
Who is he seeing?

316
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,620
Isn't it that...

317
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,040
Is this really the time for gossip?

318
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,950
This contract is indeed

319
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,260
going too far.

320
00:12:15,213 --> 00:12:16,740
As for the money in the contract...

321
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,260
Mr. Law,

322
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,310
this is not about money.

323
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,070
Do not assume money

324
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,310
can settle everything.

325
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,470
Do I look like someone short on cash?

326
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,430
Ma Fu.

327
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:31,780
Guys,

328
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,140
let us all calm down.

329
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,260
This case

330
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,260
is genuinely important.

331
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,190
It affects our long-term future.

332
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,260
Okay?

333
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,140
Shall we talk?

334
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,500
There is nothing to talk about.

335
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,380
There is nothing between us

336
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,590
worth talking about.

337
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,380
Ma...

338
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:48,740
Mr. Law.

339
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:49,780
How about this?

340
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,140
Take a moment to calm down.

341
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,780
I will go talk it over with Ma Yang.

342
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,380
Call me Ma Fu?

343
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,740
Ma Yang.

344
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,830
Qian, I was not snapping
at you just now.

345
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,860
This Ponytail Live thing

346
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,590
has been torturing me
these past two days.

347
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,435
I am really on
the verge of breaking down.

348
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,470
Ma Yang.

349
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,900
About this Sima Fu,

350
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,430
he is actually from the Sima family...

351
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:21,780
Forget it.

352
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,190
This is all on me.

353
00:13:23,257 --> 00:13:24,860
If you do not want to take this case,

354
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,860
then we will drop it.

355
00:13:25,968 --> 00:13:27,902
I will talk to him
and figure something out.

356
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,500
You need to figure
something out quickly.

357
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,346
You have no idea
what I have been through these two days.

358
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,860
Did you watch my livestream?

359
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,500
Look.

360
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,900
You did not even watch my livestream.

361
00:13:41,857 --> 00:13:43,413
If you have never suffered their pain,

362
00:13:43,413 --> 00:13:44,900
do not preach kindness to others.

363
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,620
If this keeps up,

364
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,020
there is no way
I will ever be able to date.

365
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,620
Enough.

366
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,260
I am going out to get some air.

367
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,020
Enough.

368
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,140
No.

369
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,500
Out.

370
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,620
It is a black cat.

371
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,110
I am allergic to it.

372
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,780
Okay?

373
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,635
I am allergic to it.

374
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,346
Mr. Pei.

375
00:14:13,835 --> 00:14:15,780
Mr. Lawrence said
he is allergic to cat fur,

376
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,746
and wants Yintang
removed from the company.

377
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,110
Loss.

378
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,020
This is an office.

379
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,140
A pet in the office

380
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,310
is not a good sign.

381
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:26,900
Mr. Law.

382
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,740
Yintang is not just any black cat.

383
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,430
It is our company mascot.

384
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,660
It has witnessed
Tengda's entire journey...

385
00:14:34,813 --> 00:14:37,102
from the very beginning
to where we are today.

386
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,950
And look at Yintang's forehead.

387
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,740
Jet black and glossy,
radiating nothing but good fortune.

388
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,470
It is a sign that our company will

389
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,791
continue to grow and prosper.

390
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,230
Well, okay.

391
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,710
But if it is staying in the company,

392
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,780
it has to create value.

393
00:14:58,057 --> 00:14:58,830
Here is the plan.

394
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,590
Set up social media accounts for it.

395
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,500
Bring it into
the broader Tengda content matrix.

396
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,620
And boost its IP value.

397
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,540
Yintang,

398
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,230
let us put up with this for now.

399
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,260
Once I get in touch with Mr. Sima,

400
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,990
I will get Sima Fu out immediately.

401
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:28,900
Tomorrow,

402
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,280
I will buy you more canned food,

403
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,257
and some dried fish too.

404
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,020
Please make sure to

405
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,620
like, comment, and share

406
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,430
to support Ponytail Live.

407
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,540
(These yoga pants
are extremely stretchy.)

408
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,260
- Yes.
- Yes.

409
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,620
(You can see
how well they fit the body.)

410
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,380
(Take a look at this pair right here.)

411
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,900
(You can honestly say...)

412
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,140
(Can...)

413
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,380
(They photograph
beautifully at the beach.)

414
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,380
(We only have ninety-nine orders left.)

415
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,660
(Just ninety-nine orders.)

416
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,230
(The current price is only 19.9 yuan.)

417
00:16:03,368 --> 00:16:05,102
Where are you? I am coming over.

418
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,110
The key point is,
the fabric barely wrinkles.

419
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:09,260
There are still some creases.

420
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:09,930
End the stream!

421
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,260
But...

422
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,260
Change your clothes right now!

423
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:11,857
Wait...

424
00:16:11,857 --> 00:16:13,080
Mr. Pei, we are still live.

425
00:16:13,102 --> 00:16:13,946
End it immediately!

426
00:16:13,991 --> 00:16:14,540
Please hold on.

427
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,350
We are still live.

428
00:16:15,413 --> 00:16:16,350
Hurry up!

429
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,830
What are you doing?

430
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:18,780
Sorry, Ma Yang.

431
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,500
I did not realize
this was how you streamed.

432
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,020
Change your clothes now.
End the stream.

433
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,780
Where am I supposed to go?

434
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,780
There are tens of thousands watching.

435
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,168
You cannot just leave them hanging.

436
00:16:25,168 --> 00:16:27,020
No, but you cannot stream
this product either.

437
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,590
Wasn't this one taken by Ma Fu?

438
00:16:28,591 --> 00:16:29,702
The quality is terrible.

439
00:16:29,724 --> 00:16:30,780
I have no choice, either.

440
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:33,310
If you are going to stream it,
just tell the truth.

441
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,260
If I tell the truth,
this product is done for.

442
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,500
Then, we destroy it live.

443
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,950
Destroy it live?

444
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,700
(Winter Fairy. Bare Legs Miracle.)

445
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,230
Guys.

446
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,020
This bare leg miracle product...

447
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,990
Do not buy it.

448
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,350
You think their color
looks natural, right?

449
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:55,860
Come on.

450
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,140
Turn off the beauty filter for me.

451
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,020
Everyone.

452
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:58,990
Now. Quickly.

453
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,500
Does it still look natural now?

454
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,830
It looks fake as hell.

455
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,870
The color of this product
is extremely unnatural.

456
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,820
And when you wear it,
it looks completely fake.

457
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,340
(Key selling point. Natural skin tone)
It is full of creases everywhere,

458
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,820
like a durian mille crepe.

459
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,870
They do the most marketing online.

460
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,150
They run the most ads.

461
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,340
(Read from the script)
Yet, the price is the highest,

462
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,580
and the quality is the worst.

463
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,580
Do you know how much

464
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,780
(Pause)
they sell this for?

465
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,740
One hundred eighty!

466
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,020
Shut up.

467
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,670
Pause? What pause?

468
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,100
Everyone.

469
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,390
Do not send me gifts.

470
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,190
I, Ma Yang, am not short on money.

471
00:17:29,813 --> 00:17:30,780
Just now someone

472
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,580
sent me a gift.

473
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,430
(Keep talking and I'll sue you.)
Kick him out.

474
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,190
Everyone.

475
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:33,990
Watch carefully.

476
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,190
I, Ma Yang,

477
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,390
will never coexist

478
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,260
with fake products!

479
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,710
This lotus leaf and winter melon

480
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,820
rose green tea

481
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,020
not only helps slim down,

482
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,540
but also nourishes the skin.

483
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,470
I will cut it open right now.

484
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,340
There is no winter melon inside at all.

485
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,150
(Product testing only. Do not imitate)
These rose petals are loose,

486
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,430
and the lotus leaves are shredded too.

487
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,300
Without dosage,

488
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,670
what benefits are there to discuss?

489
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,950
The Northern Realm
has been buried in sandstorms lately,

490
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,780
and yet, they claim you
cannot live without this herbal

491
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,430
pearl cream.

492
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,950
It is a complete scam.

493
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,413
Do you know why the ingredient list

494
00:18:13,502 --> 00:18:14,740
is written entirely in English?

495
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,540
It is meant to fool you.

496
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,910
Why can't I use my Qingyuan True Flame?

497
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,910
So it is the Black Sesame Divine Pill,
steamed and sun-dried nine times.

498
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,540
Your internal power

499
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,470
comes entirely from this?

500
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,100
This is fraud.

501
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,057
You all need to know,

502
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,680
black sesame is forty-six percent fat,

503
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,780
and twenty four percent carbohydrates.

504
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,710
After eating it,

505
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,580
there is only one bodily change.

506
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,430
Your face gets rounder
and you gain weight.

507
00:18:59,100 --> 00:18:59,990
Transition.

508
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,013
(You think this color
looks natural, right?)

509
00:19:05,013 --> 00:19:05,580
Director.

510
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,050
(Come on, turn off the beauty filter.)

511
00:19:07,057 --> 00:19:10,150
Director. I have revised all the title
pages related to product placement.

512
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,150
See if there are any issues.

513
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,100
(This fabric is completely ordinary.)

514
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,150
(What is this brand called?)

515
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,500
(It is called Winter Fairy.)

516
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,780
(They do the most marketing online,
and run the most ads.)

517
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,630
(But their prices are the highest.)

518
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,390
(Because of additives.)

519
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,820
(It is all meant to deceive you.)

520
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,580
(Even miracle pills
are not that effective.)

521
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,010
(You need to understand,
black sesame is forty six percent fat.)

522
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,870
Do you

523
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,580
never go online?

524
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:38,990
All those embedded brands

525
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,990
were completely destroyed

526
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,260
by your Mr. Ma

527
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,630
during his livestream.

528
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,870
The title pages...

529
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,540
This whole production has to be reshot.

530
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,990
Lu Zhiyao said

531
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:59,710
you need to rush and redo

532
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,470
everything related to his scenes.

533
00:20:05,591 --> 00:20:07,300
Not reverting to the original version.

534
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,910
He

535
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,430
has come up with

536
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,060
some new ideas.

537
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,780
Mr. Ma, ever since we switched
to destroying products on livestream,

538
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,780
those unlicensed sellers

539
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,635
have shut down
their online stores and vanished.

540
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,470
Mr. Law even called them startup brands,

541
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,780
but they were all junk products.

542
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,430
He said all the products involved

543
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,760
have been pulled for rectification,
along with public apologies.

544
00:20:51,768 --> 00:20:52,430
Good.

545
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,390
Honestly, it feels great.

546
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:54,870
Mr. Ma,

547
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,990
quite a few brands
have reached out to us,

548
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,100
saying that as long as

549
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,100
we do not mention them
during the livestream,

550
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,870
they are willing to sponsor us.

551
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:03,670
Sponsor us?

552
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:04,340
Yes.

553
00:21:04,657 --> 00:21:06,390
Is that not basically protection money?

554
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,710
Do they think we are the mob?

555
00:21:09,991 --> 00:21:12,146
Put together a blacklist
and send it to me. Right now.

556
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,710
It is already done.

557
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,300
I'll send you all
their requests immediately.

558
00:21:15,302 --> 00:21:16,102
Okay.

559
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,340
Sponsorship, huh?

560
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,340
Post it.

561
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,100
Post it.

562
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,190
Post it.

563
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,190
Mr. Ma.

564
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,390
You posted all
their private messages online?

565
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:37,340
That...

566
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,020
I am someone now

567
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,500
with a serious number of followers.

568
00:21:39,902 --> 00:21:41,580
Do you know
what my fans call themselves?

569
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,710
What?

570
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,740
They call themselves Aima.

571
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,230
They say I am a fighter.

572
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,630
They say I represent
the spirit of Tengda.

573
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,540
What if Mr. Law finds out?

574
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,630
We have Mr. Pei backing us.

575
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,190
Why would I be afraid of him?

576
00:21:56,813 --> 00:21:59,060
How could you let Ocean
destroy the products?

577
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,990
My entire business plan
has been completely ruined.

578
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,740
You cannot even imagine

579
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,190
what we are facing right now.

580
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,780
Do you know how much
we will have to pay in penalties?

581
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,670
An astronomical figure.

582
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,630
First,

583
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,390
we have to refund everything they have

584
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,540
already paid.

585
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,710
Second,

586
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,968
we have to pay Ponytail Live

587
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:25,300
all the breach penalties
under their cooperation agreement.

588
00:22:25,502 --> 00:22:27,480
On top of that,
we also have to pay the penalties

589
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,190
under Tengda's strategic
partnership with them.

590
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,910
They are even going to sue us.

591
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,740
This whole thing is

592
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:33,950
a complete

593
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,870
disaster.

594
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,710
Are you finished?

595
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:39,870
Then let me say a few things.

596
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:41,390
First,

597
00:22:41,657 --> 00:22:43,670
some of those products
involve false advertising.

598
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,670
If it goes to court,
we are not in the wrong.

599
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:46,820
Second,

600
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:49,630
many of those unlicensed products
do not meet standards at all,

601
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,300
so there is no breach on our side.

602
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:52,710
Third,

603
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,100
all your ridiculous schemes

604
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,910
are honestly no longer my concern.

605
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,150
But have you looked
at this quarter's accounts?

606
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,430
Even if we lose
and pay all the penalties,

607
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,480
it still costs less
than your personal expenses.

608
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,340
By the way, Ms. Xin,

609
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,430
all those helicopter expenses of his

610
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,190
will not be reimbursed by my side.

611
00:23:10,302 --> 00:23:11,870
He can bill his father for that.

612
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,710
You are crazy.

613
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,670
One last thing.

614
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,100
From now on,
speak Chinese when you talk to me.

615
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,102
Otherwise, I will not
respond to a single word.

616
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:31,670
Do not forget this.

617
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,100
Every decision I made

618
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,950
has your signature on it.

619
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,430
You are the one in charge of Tengda.

620
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,150
All the compensation payments

621
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,910
will ultimately fall on you.

622
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,190
So you can speak properly after all.

623
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:47,780
Ms. Xin.

624
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,910
Go take a look
at this quarter's accounts.

625
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,857
If he can actually make
the company lose money,

626
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,857
I will praise him.

627
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,020
But starting now,

628
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,430
please stop tormenting

629
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,060
everyone at Tengda.

630
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,300
Look at this.

631
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,260
Mr. Law really knows how to burn money.

632
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,780
Personal expenses,

633
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,470
losses from the production shutdown,

634
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,613
and penalties from destroying
products on livestream.

635
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,740
If Mr. Pei can keep this up,

636
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,540
you'll be

637
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,340
the biggest money loser of all.

638
00:24:34,368 --> 00:24:36,759
Whether who ends up the biggest loser
doesn't matter anymore.

639
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,470
What matters is that I cannot tolerate
him for even one more minute.

640
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,430

have this ominous feeling?)

we build a new model

and move toward a stronger
cultural industry ecosystem.

650

656
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,670

00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:28,009
I did not expect that my last order
before leaving the country

658
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:28,970
would still be with you.

00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,190
What a cursed coincidence.

660

661
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:35,070
I genuinely do not understand
what you are talking about.

662
00:25:35,546 --> 00:25:36,910
But that does not really matter.

663
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:37,870
As an

664
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:38,500

668
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,100
since you enjoy driving so much,

669
00:25:44,213 --> 00:25:45,950
I do not mind leaving this car with you.

670
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:47,950
IP?

671
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,990
You are really asking for trouble.

672
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:50,990
Let me be clear.

673
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:51,870
I have rheumatism.

674
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,060
I cannot drive your car.

675
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,780
Then, just leave it at the airport.

676
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,390

Yes, I am.

691
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,230
May I ask

692
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:15,910
what your relationship is

693
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,470

696
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:27,100
Sima Tu.

697
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,740
These names were
really chosen at random...

698
00:27:33,102 --> 00:27:34,670
Wait, do they also have
an eldest brother

699
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:35,740
named Sima Wan?

700
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,470
You mentioned before

701
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,260
that Mr. Sima

702
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,990
wanted his sons to come here
and toughen up a bit.

703
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:49,230
But now it feels like

704
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,635
he sent me here to be the whetstone

705
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:51,710
for his sons instead.

706
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,500
Let me be clear.

707
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,780
That is not in my contract

708
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,710
with Mr. Sima.

709
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,390
Get in touch with him immediately.

710

Mr. Pei.

711
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,540
To be honest with you,

712
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,870
ever since Sima Fu arrived,

713
00:28:03,257 --> 00:28:05,300
I have not been able
to reach Mr. Sima either.

714
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,230
In overseas,
his phone will not go through?

715
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,300
He was not kidnapped, was he?

716
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,768
Before leaving, Mr. Sima told us

717
00:28:15,791 --> 00:28:17,435
that he had a very important plan abroad

718
00:28:17,457 --> 00:28:19,740
and asked us not to contact him
for the time being.

719
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,990
A very important plan?

720
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,870
What kind of plan?

721
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,780
The boss's affairs

722
00:28:26,924 --> 00:28:28,902
are not something
I am entitled to ask about.

723
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:35,430
One Sima Fu is already more than enough.

724
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,060
Who knows where
these brothers came from?

725
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,580
What kind of working style is this?

726
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,710
I understand everything you said,

727
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:51,950
but why do you have to be
the one taking responsibility?

728
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:54,710
Why can it not be me?

729
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:55,820
Excuse me,

730
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:56,950
sorry to interrupt.

731
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,910

733
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,910
May I ask what kind of work

734
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,190
you intend to do at Tengda?

735
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,260
Mr. Pei,

736
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,100
I have already thought through

737
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,300
my responsibilities

738
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,540
and how I plan to work

739
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,710
after joining Tengda.

740
00:29:10,902 --> 00:29:12,230
I look forward to your guidance.

741
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,280
Here is the thing, Mr. Pei.

742
00:29:13,346 --> 00:29:14,702
From now on, report directly to me.

743
00:29:14,702 --> 00:29:16,880
I'll discuss things
with my second brother afterward.

744
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,740
Our third brother here
just likes to show off.

745
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:19,950
Please excuse him.

What is going on this time?

748
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,060
Mr. Pei, as soon as I heard
something major had happened,

749
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,340
I rushed back from the set.

750
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,230
You said in the group chat

751
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,500
that two investors were coming.

752
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:47,710
Are those the two?

753
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,500
They are also surnamed Sima.

754
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,950
Are they related to Mr. Law?

755
00:29:54,235 --> 00:29:56,300
They are not brothers
from the same family, are they?

756
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:56,870
Well...

757
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,990
They are Sima Fu's
second and third brothers.

758
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,500
Just like Sima Fu,

759
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,190
they are all investors in Tengda.

760
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,990
They may

761
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,100
be staying at Tengda for a short time.

762
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,390
Everyone will need to get used to it.

763
00:30:09,546 --> 00:30:10,710
Sorry for the inconvenience.

764
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:14,150
No wonder you told me earlier
to cut Sima Fu some slack.

765
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,020
So when are those two leaving?

766
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,080
How did you even get involved
with a family like this?

767
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,991
Since when has Tengda
had outside investors?

768
00:30:20,013 --> 00:30:21,280
Wasn't Tengda founded by us?

769
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,230
Alright.

770
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,260
Mr. Pei,

771
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,820
is Tengda facing
some kind of difficulty?

772
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,670
If funding is an issue, I can...

773
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:32,820
No need.

774
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,230
Our current investment allocation

775
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,413
is already fully subscribed.

776
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,990
And honestly,

777
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,870
those two can't be harder
to deal with than Mr. Law.

778
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:40,780
That's reassuring.

779
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,580
As Tengda continues to expand,

780
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,470
the issues we encounter
are bound to become more...

781
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,580
complicated.

782
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:51,990
Let's just take it

783
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,390
as part of the learning process.

784
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,390
Got it.

785
00:30:55,746 --> 00:30:56,670
We all understand.

786
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,300
Mr. Pei, don't worry.

787
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,430
We can handle this.

788
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,746
We won't put you in a tough spot.

789
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,150
Just make sure

790
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,100
you don't push yourselves too hard.

791
00:31:11,746 --> 00:31:12,820
- Mr. Pei,
- Mr. Pei,

792
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,390
- please call all department heads
- please call all department heads

793
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,768
- to the conference room.
- to the conference room.

794
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,968
- I want to speak with them directly.
- I want to speak with them directly.

795
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:20,150
Today,

796
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,390
the reason for this meeting

797
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,470
is simply

798
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,100
to meet

799
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,580
Tengda's core staff,

800
00:31:30,102 --> 00:31:31,020
have a conversation,

801
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,580
and talk things through.

802
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,870
You're welcome

803
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:36,150
to share your thoughts.

804
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,630
No need to speak freely just yet.

805
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,710
Let me wrap up

806
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:39,780
today's meeting first.

807
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,230
This was mainly my idea,

808
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,924
so I will chair the meeting, all right?

809
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,780
What is Tengda's
strongest pillar right now?

810
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,470
It is the gaming industry.

811
00:31:47,502 --> 00:31:49,190
The Divine Mountains and Seas
is currently

812
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,035
the hottest game on the market.
So we must

813
00:31:51,057 --> 00:31:53,870
fully support its development, right?

814
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:54,910
Sui.

815
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,835
(Support The Divine Mountains and Seas)
You are getting a bit carried away.

816
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,710
What we need is

817
00:32:00,035 --> 00:32:01,780
comprehensive and balanced development.

818
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,020
Every line of business

819
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:05,820
should become

820
00:32:05,946 --> 00:32:07,835
(Balanced development)
a core pillar.

821
00:32:09,968 --> 00:32:11,302
Tu, after all that you have said,

822
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,190
it is clear you
still have not figured out

823
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,410
what you actually want to do.

824
00:32:14,413 --> 00:32:16,260
If you ask me,
we should focus heavily on games.

825
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,013
If you cannot
get your core business right,

826
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,540
and still want to try side paths,
is that really wise?

827
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,820
Listen to me, all right?

828
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,340
No, better listen to me.

829
00:32:25,302 --> 00:32:26,746
To borrow one of your young people's

830
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,260
internet phrases,

831
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,470
dddd.

832
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,950
Those who know, know.

833
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,100
After all,

834
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,100
I do keep up with the times.

835
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,260
(My goodness.)

836
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,580
(This meeting is completely absurd.)

837
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,470
(These two Simas.)

838
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,990
(They are talking past each other.)

839
00:32:44,124 --> 00:32:44,950
Aren't these all

840
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,100
memes from two years ago?

841
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,580
Mr. Tu,

842
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,300
Mr. Sui,

843
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,710
let us focus the meeting
on a single key point.

844
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:53,150
We were previously developing

845
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:55,060
version 2.0
of the Divine Mountains and Seas.

846
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,946
Why don't we first decide
whether to continue pushing it forward?

847
00:32:57,968 --> 00:32:59,150
- Do not proceed.
- Proceed.

848
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,940
(Mr. Sima)

849
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:05,780
Hello.

850
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,230
The number you have dialed
is temporarily unavailable.

851
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:13,020
Hello.

852
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,500
The number you have dialed
is temporarily unavailable.

853
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,260
See? I was not lying.

854
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,020
There really is no way to reach him.

855
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,650
With his sons
causing this much chaos,

856
00:33:23,657 --> 00:33:25,680
he has the mood to focus
on some so-called major plan?

857
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:27,740
When he gets busy,

858
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,150
he does tend to vanish

859
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,430
like this.

860
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,500
Then, what usually happens every time

861
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,950
he disappears and comes back?

862
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,780
What happens is that

863
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,430
his group

864
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:40,630
moves up to another level.

865
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,230
Whether his group grows or not,
I honestly do not know.

866
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:48,500
But if this keeps going,

867
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,740
Tengda is going
to be completely wrecked.

868
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,820
(You have a new group message.)

869
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,190
(Lin Wan: Mr. Sui has
confirmed that the new 2.0 version)

870
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:59,260
(of the Divine Mountains and Seas
will be released tomorrow.)

871
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,150
(Lv Mingliang: Mr. Tu has confirmed)

872
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:02,080
(that the Divine Mountains and Seas)

873
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,300
(Version 2.0 will be postponed.)

874
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,340
(Lin Wan: Mr. Sui
announces that Version 2.0)

875
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,060
(will still move forward.)

876
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,391
(Lv Mingliang: Mr. Tu announces
the Version 2.0 can proceed as well,)

877
00:34:08,435 --> 00:34:10,470
(but he wants
to replace the illustrator.)

878
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:12,140
(Is that even possible?
We can't replace Ruan.)

879
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:12,990
(What should we do?)

880
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:14,500
Is this them doing actual work,

881
00:34:14,591 --> 00:34:16,020
or just fighting each other?

882
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:21,990
Mr. Pei.

883
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:22,990
You said before

884
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:25,220
that these two brothers
would be easier than Mr. Law.

885
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,430
Turns out they
are even harder to deal with.

886
00:34:27,635 --> 00:34:28,660
They do not dare touch us,

887
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,191
so they go after Ruan Guangjian instead.

888
00:34:30,213 --> 00:34:31,829
Now no one dares go back to the office.

889
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:33,490
Everyone is hiding out
at the gaming cafe.

890
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,390
I was the one who brought Ruan in.

891
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:36,990
No matter what, we have to protect him.

892
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:37,700
Mr. Pei.

893
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:39,700
Say something.

894
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,750
Do not serve the food yet.

895
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,310
Even Ms. Xin is here.

896
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:45,990
You are sick of them too, right?

897
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,880
(Tengda Business Group)
(Sima Tu: The meeting will continue)

898
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,257
(tomorrow at 9 AM.)

899
00:34:58,968 --> 00:35:01,299
(Business Group of Tengda)
(Sima Sui: The meeting will continue)

900
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,090
(tomorrow at 8 AM.)

901
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:04,750
Am I blind or what?

902
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,750
What is the difference
between these two groups?

903
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:09,060
The Tengda Business Group
was created by Sima Tu,

904
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,270
and Sima Sui is not in it.

905
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,430
The Business Group of Tengda

906
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:13,368
was created by Sima Sui,
and Sima Tu is not in it.

907
00:35:13,391 --> 00:35:14,270
Seriously?

908
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,870
Are they picking a fight on purpose?

909
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,060
Who could keep this straight?

910
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,790
I need to change the label fast,

911
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,620
or I will send something
to the wrong group.

912
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,300
(Tengda Group Without Tu, With Sui)

913
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,470
Lv, you did not change a remark.

914
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,700
You changed the group name!

915
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,390
What?

916
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,220
What do we do now?

917
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,270
Change it back.

918
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:33,950
I seriously cannot believe this.

919
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,100
Mr. Tu, Mr. Sui.

920
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:38,430
Here is the situation.

921
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,020
Tengda has internal rules.

922
00:35:40,057 --> 00:35:41,620
People do not start work this early.

923
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,724
How about we set
the meeting for eleven instead?

924
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:44,750
And one more thing.

925
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:46,220
I think our top priority right now

926
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,100
should be pushing forward

927
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,500
the new version
of the Divine Mountains and Seas.

928
00:35:48,568 --> 00:35:50,750
We need to get everyone
internally aligned first

929
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,830
before asking people to work.

930
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:53,350
If we cannot even agree among ourselves,

931
00:35:53,702 --> 00:35:55,570
are we not
just inviting others to laugh at us?

932
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,350
And also,

933
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:59,310
about our illustrator, Ruan Guangjian.

934
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:01,060
My suggestion is
that you take a look at his

935
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,220
social media accounts first.

936
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,746
He is verified, so he is easy to find.

937
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:06,750
You can review his art style
and his follower numbers.

938
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,390
After all, both his artwork

939
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:10,635
and the game itself
are very well received by players.

940
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:12,524
We should
be on the same page about that.

941
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,310
What is Pei Qian trying to do?

942
00:36:16,391 --> 00:36:18,391
Not a single person
shows up during work hours.

943
00:36:18,391 --> 00:36:20,310
They are pushing back against us?

944
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,750
This kind of unhealthy attitude
really needs fixing.

945
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,430
Alright then.

946
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,060
Cancel
tomorrow's meeting for now.

947
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,220
We will start
with employee one-on-one talks.

948
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,830
Employee talks are not the key issue.

949
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:38,950
Employee training is.

950
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,870
Start with employee talks.

951
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:44,020
Move on to employee training.

952
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,790
Talks during the day.

953
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,020
Training at night.

954
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,220
Starting tomorrow,

955
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,324
everyone will need to adapt
to a new work schedule.

956
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:54,310
We cannot keep being as lax as before.

957
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,020
Is this insane or what?

958
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,368
No, what is this supposed to be?
