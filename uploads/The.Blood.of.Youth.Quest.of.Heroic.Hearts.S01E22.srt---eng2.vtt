[Episode 22]

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.520
What would you like, gentlemen?

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.240
We want

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.400
to be different.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.000
Different?

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.280
Yes.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.720
Different.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.920
Count on me.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.800
This way, please.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.000
Come out.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.320
Come out.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.840
Well,

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.240
please bear with it.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.640
I think

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.920
it works quite well.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.640
Is this to your satisfaction?

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.520
Of course.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.800
Here you go.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.280
Thank you.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.160
Let's go.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.640
Buns! Hot, steamy buns!

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.760
Come take a look.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.600
You must be hungry.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.760
I'll buy some food.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.600
Wait for me.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.340
Buns.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.080
Sir.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.280
Two buns, please.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.320
All right.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.200
The big one.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.120
Here.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.400
Thank you.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:07.920
Buns!

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.360
What a dumb woman.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.960
She'll fetch me a great price.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.240
Spare me, Sir.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.920
Sir.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.640
Sir.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.560
Sir.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.680
I didn't know you were a man.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.080
Sir.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.320
Don't.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.760
Weigui.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.760
Weigui.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.160
Why did you come here?

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.760
What is going on?

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.360
Sir,

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.480
save me.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.320
I didn't know he was a man.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.480
I thought he was a lost girl,

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.200
and I wanted to escort her home.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.000
I...

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.520
It's all a misunderstanding.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.360
I see.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:52.800
You are a human trafficker.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.880
No.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.560
Of course, not.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.040
I'm not.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.640
Weigui.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.760
People like him

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.960
shouldn't be killed.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.040
He should be

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.200
castrated instead.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.000
You might as well kill me.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.160
Then, I'll kill you.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.880
Don't.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.520
Sir.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.120
I'm sorry.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.560
Please show mercy

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.240
and release me.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.720
I will turn over a new leaf.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.040
Spare me, Sir.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.280
Killing you will only

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.280
dirty my hands.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.320
Weigui.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.880
Let's continue our journey.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.720
We'll

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.360
leave him to his own fate.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.400
Let's go.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.760
Don't.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.480
Don't leave, Sir.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.920
Sir.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.840
We're in the middle of nowhere. Untie me!

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:34.440
Sir!

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.760
Miss.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.080
Miss.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.320
Save me.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.760
I just ran into a group of bandits.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.600
They stole everything from me.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.920
Save me.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.200
Sect Leader Ye,

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.160
you promised to get me the Skysplitter.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.920
But now,

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.200
the sword and its bearer are gone.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.640
How do you explain this?

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.360
Be patient.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.600
I know where they are.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.720
Even though we didn't get the Skysplitter,

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.240
I have ways to make them

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.800
surrender it to me.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.200
Weigui is now haunted by his inner demon

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.160
and has killed many.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.920
Righteous sects like yours should capture him

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.160
and restore peace to the world.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.280
Then,

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.760
we will lure Lei Lingze out.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.200
Desperate to save his friend,

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.840
he will give us

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.000
the Skysplitter.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.680
Fine.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.440
If we fail to get the Skysplitter this time,

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.080
I'll mobilize the entire martial arts world

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.760
to kill you.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.160
Sect Leader,

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.080
your ailment...

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:26.680
This time,

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.240
I must get the Skysplitter.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.800
Was this your home?

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:43.840
Did you return here before?

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.800
Who are you?

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.280
We are traveling

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.240
to visit our relatives.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:00.880
We don't have an accommodation.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.360
We were passing by and saw

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.280
that there was no one here,

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.440
so we came in.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.200
Are you the owner?

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:08.920
This place

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.760
hasn't been occupied for a long time.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.080
For a long time?

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.000
But it

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.480
doesn't look dilapidated.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.680
The previous owner

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.920
moved in from another region.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.760
He was so kind.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.640
Our village is poor.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.120
He helped

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.600
every household in the village.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.000
However,

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.360
one day,

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.840
his family was murdered.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.560
His only son

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.600
went missing as well.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.000
As his neighbors,

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.240
we keep the place tidy

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.960
from time to time.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.800
If the son returns someday,

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.360
he has a place to live, at least.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.400
I'm sure you won't be able

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.240
to find an accommodation now.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.240
Why don't you stay here?

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:55.920
The previous owner

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.520
was a kind person.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.240
If he were here,

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.560
he would've accommodated you as well.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.240
If the surviving son

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.400
were still alive,

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.080
he would be around your age now.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.200
Just stay here.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:13.960
Thank you.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:18.720
Weigui.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:19.840
Did you hear that?

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:21.720
Come.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.960
Suddenly, I realize

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.600
that some things are best

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.320
left forgotten.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.080
Indeed.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:58.600
Weigui.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:00.720
Weigui.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.560
Did you recall anything?

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:07.160
This sword.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:08.960
Do you remember it?

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.560
It's the Skysplitter we've been looking for.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.720
After we held a funeral for Hua Xiaohua,

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:16.680
I buried this sword

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.600
alongside her.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.440
But I took it out now,

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:21.760
thinking

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.440
that it can help dispel your inner demon

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.320
and recall your lost memory.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:32.400
Forget it.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.680
It's fine if you can't recall anything.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.000
Now that we're back here,

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:38.520
I'm sure

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.000
you'll overcome your inner demon

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.000
and reclaim your lost memory.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:45.560
Let's go.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.080
Which chamber did you stay in when you were little?

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:50.800
Do you still remember?

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:52.480
I want to visit it.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.760
Sir, please tell me

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.240
where he is.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.500
[Weigui's Father]

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.240
I can satisfy whatever demand

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.760
you make.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.120
I do not know where Xiao Se is.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.720
But everyone says

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.720
you're one of the few good friends he has.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.040
Surely, you know.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.800
It's just a rumor.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.800
I don't know anyone called Xiao Se.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:56.960
You lied.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.080
Uncle Xiao came to you before he left.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.240
He wants to live in seclusion.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.160
I shouldn't let anyone disturb him.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.200
Protecting each other.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:11.480
That's

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.520
what friendship means.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:15.560
Then,

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.320
can no one cure her at all?

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.240
Her ailment

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.280
is very rare.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.840
Even if there is a cure,

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.920
it comes at the cost of her life.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:30.720
After she is cured,

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.080
she only has three days to live.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.080
Therefore, why not let her cling to that hope?

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.200
It's painful,

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:40.880
but she will continue living.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:47.400
Weigui.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:48.400
Hide now.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.800
You must live.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:53.720
Father.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:39.120
Weigui.
