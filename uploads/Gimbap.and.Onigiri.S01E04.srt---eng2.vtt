WEBVTT

00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:54.576
Good morning.

00:00:57.495 --> 00:00:58.830
Good morning.

00:01:12.343 --> 00:01:14.262
Here. Enjoy.

00:01:15.597 --> 00:01:17.140
Everything looks delicious.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.267
I can really eat all this?

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.226
Yeah.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.562
Because I'm not going home for Chuseok,

00:01:22.645 --> 00:01:24.898
eomma brought me tons of side dishes

00:01:24.981 --> 00:01:26.858
and snacks that I love.

00:01:28.776 --> 00:01:30.236
Chuseok?

00:01:34.324 --> 00:01:36.743
It's kind of like Obon in Japan.

00:01:37.827 --> 00:01:39.037
I see. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:39.537 --> 00:01:42.206
Speaking of which,
are you going home for Obon?

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:50.465
I'm still thinking about it.

00:01:53.843 --> 00:01:56.012
Let's eat before it gets cold.

00:01:57.722 --> 00:01:59.224
Thank you for the food.

00:02:00.058 --> 00:02:01.726
Thank you for the food.

00:02:07.065 --> 00:02:08.816
This is good.

00:02:15.657 --> 00:02:16.824
Kkulmat.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.580
What? Was that wrong?

00:02:22.664 --> 00:02:25.083
That's what you say
when it's delicious, right--

00:02:26.501 --> 00:02:27.669
Kkulmat?

00:02:27.752 --> 00:02:28.962
Yeah, that!

00:02:29.545 --> 00:02:32.006
That's right. It's right, but…

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.050
You're too cute.

00:02:35.343 --> 00:02:38.012
The fact that you're
trying to remember Korean words

00:02:38.513 --> 00:02:39.514
makes me happy.

00:02:40.765 --> 00:02:41.599
I'm glad.

00:02:43.101 --> 00:02:44.269
Let's eat.

00:02:49.023 --> 00:02:51.067
I ate a little too much.

00:02:51.567 --> 00:02:55.029
You basically ate
all the seaweed soup, after all.

00:03:12.755 --> 00:03:14.716
Oh, sorry! I couldn't help myself…

00:03:16.843 --> 00:03:18.761
Did you want one too?

00:03:19.262 --> 00:03:20.096
Huh?

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:21.389
All right…

00:03:23.975 --> 00:03:25.560
I'll shu… sho…

00:03:26.811 --> 00:03:28.229
I'll share some with you.

00:03:29.731 --> 00:03:30.732
Thank you.

00:03:30.815 --> 00:03:33.026
NURUNGJI

00:03:34.277 --> 00:03:36.988
Can I ask what flavor this is?

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:41.034
A warm flavor.

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:43.244
A warm flavor?

00:03:43.328 --> 00:03:46.581
This is my favorite candy.

00:03:46.664 --> 00:03:49.292
It lifts my spirits
especially when I'm feeling down,

00:03:49.375 --> 00:03:50.835
so you have to try it.

00:03:52.003 --> 00:03:53.087
I'll look forward to it.

00:03:53.963 --> 00:03:57.342
Thank you for sharing
such a precious candy with me.

00:04:02.221 --> 00:04:03.681
What's wrong?

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:49.644
BIG BRO

00:04:56.692 --> 00:04:57.693
Hello?

00:05:05.284 --> 00:05:08.079
This is route number TE301.

00:05:08.663 --> 00:05:11.249
Last stop is Nagano Station.

00:05:13.584 --> 00:05:16.045
We will arrive at Nagano Station

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:18.673
at approximately 5:05.

00:05:22.135 --> 00:05:24.846
We will now turn off the lights…

00:06:43.382 --> 00:06:45.343
- You can do it!
- Taiga!

00:06:45.426 --> 00:06:48.221
- Run! Go!
- Run Taiga!

00:06:48.304 --> 00:06:49.263
You can do it!

00:06:49.347 --> 00:06:51.057
Taiga!

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:05.071
Taiga.

00:07:05.154 --> 00:07:06.781
You're off the team.

00:07:17.333 --> 00:07:19.585
Don't look so depressed.

00:07:20.294 --> 00:07:23.256
You were just a reserve member
this one time.

00:07:23.756 --> 00:07:25.383
I'm not depressed…

00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:29.804
If you have the time to be sulking,

00:07:29.887 --> 00:07:32.139
shouldn't you be practicing?

00:08:05.756 --> 00:08:07.717
Food is ready. Eat up.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.385
- Thank you.
- All right.

00:08:14.432 --> 00:08:16.225
I made the onigiri small for you.

00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:17.518
It's easier to eat that way.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.772
Right? Make sure you eat a lot.

00:08:21.856 --> 00:08:23.858
Here. Do your best.

00:08:23.941 --> 00:08:25.192
Thank you.

00:08:26.193 --> 00:08:27.737
Just don't get hurt.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.577
Forty-seven, forty-eight, forty-nine,

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:36.537
fifty, fifty-one…

00:08:50.885 --> 00:08:52.595
- Bye, Taiga.
- Bye.

00:08:52.678 --> 00:08:53.554
Bye.

00:08:54.055 --> 00:08:56.307
- Coach says he's treating us today.
- No way!

00:08:56.891 --> 00:08:58.434
How much will that be?

00:09:13.491 --> 00:09:14.659
5000 meters.

00:09:14.742 --> 00:09:16.494
Ready… Go!

00:09:22.333 --> 00:09:26.587
Forty-eight, forty-nine, fifty, fifty-one…

00:09:26.671 --> 00:09:28.923
First place, 13 minutes 51 seconds.

00:09:44.772 --> 00:09:45.690
Coach.

00:09:48.192 --> 00:09:49.110
Taiga.

00:09:52.196 --> 00:09:54.323
I understand that you're working hard.

00:09:55.199 --> 00:09:56.075
But you know…

00:09:57.868 --> 00:09:59.036
you're not the only one

00:10:00.329 --> 00:10:01.622
who is working hard.

00:10:09.672 --> 00:10:12.550
21. HASE TAIGA

00:10:19.223 --> 00:10:22.518
The dorm cafeteria is understaffed.

00:10:23.853 --> 00:10:26.021
So from now on, go and help them.

00:10:29.859 --> 00:10:32.528
- Man, that's brutal.
- The cafeteria?

00:10:32.611 --> 00:10:33.446
Poor guy.

00:10:33.529 --> 00:10:35.948
He got an endorsement and he's a reserve?

00:10:39.118 --> 00:10:40.327
You don't have to come out.

00:10:41.162 --> 00:10:42.997
I'll contact you once I get to Tokyo.

00:10:45.166 --> 00:10:46.083
Taiga.

00:10:48.836 --> 00:10:50.546
Are you really sure?

00:10:52.256 --> 00:10:53.174
Huh?

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.593
You know,

00:10:55.676 --> 00:10:58.012
you've loved running
since you were a child.

00:10:58.095 --> 00:11:00.765
You would run around all day if I let you.

00:11:01.932 --> 00:11:03.225
I bet you still want to run--

00:11:03.309 --> 00:11:05.144
Enough about track.

00:11:10.649 --> 00:11:13.694
There are a ton of people who are
on a completely different level than me.

00:11:15.237 --> 00:11:17.907
I tried to run as fast as I could,
but it was pointless.

00:11:19.366 --> 00:11:20.910
Just "liking" it…

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:23.954
was not enough.

00:11:27.374 --> 00:11:29.752
That's all there is to it.

00:11:31.378 --> 00:11:33.047
Don't make me talk about it anymore.

00:11:34.173 --> 00:11:35.090
Okay…

00:11:36.717 --> 00:11:37.968
You're right…

00:11:41.388 --> 00:11:42.723
It's okay.

00:11:42.806 --> 00:11:44.934
You didn't fail.

00:11:45.601 --> 00:11:47.978
You have a whole life ahead of you.

00:11:50.147 --> 00:11:51.232
Don't be anxious.

00:11:52.066 --> 00:11:55.110
Find something only you can do,
and do it at your own pace.

00:11:56.862 --> 00:11:57.821
I'm sure…

00:11:59.114 --> 00:12:02.535
As long as you try your best,
that's enough.

00:12:09.583 --> 00:12:10.876
Bye.

00:13:34.752 --> 00:13:35.711
Welcome home!

00:13:36.295 --> 00:13:37.338
Taiga!

00:13:38.881 --> 00:13:40.007
I'm home.

00:13:44.303 --> 00:13:46.096
You don't have time.
Hurry and get changed.

00:13:51.644 --> 00:13:52.645
Well then…

00:13:53.228 --> 00:13:55.189
I'd like to thank everyone

00:13:55.272 --> 00:13:57.775
who took time out of their busy schedules
to be here

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.818
for our father's 13th anniversary.

00:14:01.111 --> 00:14:01.945
May he rest in peace.

00:14:02.446 --> 00:14:03.364
- May he rest in peace.
- May he rest in peace.

00:14:08.786 --> 00:14:09.620
Yuji,

00:14:09.703 --> 00:14:12.039
- thank you for today.
- No, thank you.

00:14:13.999 --> 00:14:15.876
I must say, Masa, I'm so glad

00:14:15.959 --> 00:14:17.461
- I asked you for help.
- It was nothing.

00:14:17.544 --> 00:14:19.046
Good thing you did.

00:14:19.129 --> 00:14:22.967
Although, it is more than
90% a loan rather than "my home."

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:26.303
- That can't be helped.
- But I think you bought at a good time.

00:14:26.387 --> 00:14:29.014
The interest rates
and price of land were low.

00:14:30.265 --> 00:14:31.892
Hey, Haruto.

00:14:31.976 --> 00:14:34.979
- If Masa says so, that must be true.
- Yeah.

00:14:36.063 --> 00:14:37.690
- Right?
- If it's Masa.

00:14:37.773 --> 00:14:39.650
- Come here.
- You should all go to him for help.

00:14:39.733 --> 00:14:40.943
That's right.

00:14:43.362 --> 00:14:45.239
As expected…

00:14:45.322 --> 00:14:46.740
Come over here. Up we go.

00:14:49.368 --> 00:14:52.371
REMARKABLE!
RENEWS HIGHEST RANKING FOR THE PREFECTURE

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:29.158
I'll help.

00:15:30.576 --> 00:15:31.910
Thank you.

00:15:51.764 --> 00:15:54.850
Dad liked wood ear mushrooms, didn't he?

00:16:03.901 --> 00:16:04.985
Oh!

00:16:05.069 --> 00:16:07.029
You're good!

00:16:07.112 --> 00:16:08.781
I do this every day.

00:16:13.243 --> 00:16:15.037
- I'll take this.
- Sure.

00:16:53.992 --> 00:16:54.910
So?

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:57.538
Huh?

00:16:58.122 --> 00:17:00.749
What are you planning to do
with your life?

00:17:05.254 --> 00:17:06.463
Actually,

00:17:07.172 --> 00:17:10.467
the restaurant I'm working at right now
is pretty nice.

00:17:11.927 --> 00:17:15.347
You said it was
a privately run izakaya, right?

00:17:15.848 --> 00:17:16.765
Yeah.

00:17:17.391 --> 00:17:19.726
The owner and I run it on our own.

00:17:20.561 --> 00:17:22.563
And he relies on me a lot.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.316
You're the only part-timer?

00:17:27.401 --> 00:17:28.527
Yeah.

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:30.779
Come on, he relies on you

00:17:31.446 --> 00:17:33.115
because he has nobody else.

00:17:35.826 --> 00:17:36.910
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:17:38.996 --> 00:17:41.415
Anyone can do your job.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.340
- Dad!
- What's wrong?

00:17:50.841 --> 00:17:54.094
You little baby. Up we go. All right.

00:17:54.178 --> 00:17:57.556
Where's your mom? Let's go.

00:18:03.687 --> 00:18:06.732
But I guess what he said is right.

00:18:07.232 --> 00:18:08.942
No offense to your brother,

00:18:09.026 --> 00:18:11.195
but I think he's wrong.

00:18:11.904 --> 00:18:16.283
Both Tanomi, and the owner
really need you.

00:18:18.035 --> 00:18:19.578
You think so?

00:18:21.163 --> 00:18:22.873
Not only are you a good cook,

00:18:23.457 --> 00:18:26.126
but you're also good
at explaining the menu,

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:28.503
and you're always smiling,
no matter how busy it is.

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:34.468
But it doesn't have to be me…

00:18:35.219 --> 00:18:38.347
Just like he said, anybody can do that.

00:18:39.139 --> 00:18:40.599
That's not true.

00:18:42.559 --> 00:18:44.394
I don't think many people

00:18:44.478 --> 00:18:47.022
can keep that attitude up day after day,

00:18:47.522 --> 00:18:48.982
like it's nothing.

00:18:50.192 --> 00:18:52.778
It's something to be proud of. I know it.

00:18:57.366 --> 00:19:00.535
Being consistent
over a long period of time,

00:19:01.703 --> 00:19:03.288
is the most powerful trait.

00:19:03.997 --> 00:19:05.290
Am I wrong?

00:19:25.978 --> 00:19:27.479
I believe

00:19:28.772 --> 00:19:31.233
that your training right now
will not be wasted.

00:20:00.304 --> 00:20:01.847
NURUNGJI

00:20:12.566 --> 00:20:13.859
She's right…

00:20:15.402 --> 00:20:16.611
It's a warm flavor.

00:20:35.422 --> 00:20:38.842
Hey, where were you? Hurry up and help us.

00:20:39.843 --> 00:20:40.969
Hey…

00:20:44.139 --> 00:20:45.015
um…

00:20:47.059 --> 00:20:49.936
Right now, I'm training.

00:20:50.937 --> 00:20:51.772
Huh?

00:20:52.439 --> 00:20:54.066
It's true that right now,

00:20:54.691 --> 00:20:55.734
I'm just a part-timer

00:20:56.777 --> 00:20:58.904
and the work that I'm doing

00:20:59.696 --> 00:21:02.866
can arguably be done by anybody.

00:21:04.201 --> 00:21:05.369
But…

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:10.207
if I keep pursuing
this thing that anybody can do,

00:21:11.166 --> 00:21:12.709
in the end…

00:21:14.795 --> 00:21:18.006
I think it will turn into something
that only I can do.

00:21:21.426 --> 00:21:22.803
That's why, right now,

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:26.348
I want to treasure
the days I spend training.

00:21:28.517 --> 00:21:30.727
I want to make a steady effort,
and continue cooking.

00:21:33.772 --> 00:21:34.689
I just…

00:21:36.858 --> 00:21:38.652
wanted to tell you that.

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:53.375
What if it falls through again?

00:21:54.501 --> 00:21:55.335
What?

00:21:56.086 --> 00:21:58.964
Are you prepared to keep at it
until the very end?

00:22:00.966 --> 00:22:01.967
Prepared?

00:22:06.179 --> 00:22:07.431
That…

00:22:10.684 --> 00:22:11.852
I don't know.

00:22:16.231 --> 00:22:18.525
In the end, you haven't changed at all.

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:23.613
If you dillydally,

00:22:23.697 --> 00:22:26.241
and continue something without resolve,
you're only wasting time.

00:22:27.284 --> 00:22:30.954
Not to mention,
you already made a detour once.

00:22:53.268 --> 00:22:54.144
‪Who's that?

00:22:54.227 --> 00:22:55.437
My Senior. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:22:58.773 --> 00:22:59.858
Nice to meet you.

00:23:00.609 --> 00:23:01.902
I'm Kang Jun-ho.

00:23:03.945 --> 00:23:05.030
Let me carry those.

00:23:09.701 --> 00:23:12.204
Thanks for coming
even though it's your day off.

00:23:12.287 --> 00:23:14.247
It's nothing.

00:23:17.918 --> 00:23:19.002
Jun-ho,

00:23:19.628 --> 00:23:21.379
are you dating anyone?

00:23:21.463 --> 00:23:22.547
What?

00:23:24.591 --> 00:23:25.842
No, I'm not.

00:23:27.636 --> 00:23:29.804
Well then, what do you do for work?

00:23:29.888 --> 00:23:31.932
What are your parents like?

00:23:32.015 --> 00:23:33.099
What do you like to eat?

00:23:33.183 --> 00:23:35.268
Mom, please stop.

00:23:35.352 --> 00:23:36.436
I work

00:23:36.937 --> 00:23:39.814
at a foreign-owned trading company.

00:23:39.898 --> 00:23:41.775
My parents are civil servants.

00:23:41.858 --> 00:23:42.901
My hobby is playing soccer.

00:23:43.485 --> 00:23:46.154
I love sundae gukbap.

00:23:46.238 --> 00:23:48.198
Please ask me anything.

00:23:48.281 --> 00:23:50.325
What is your MBTI type?

00:23:51.326 --> 00:23:52.452
You know about MBTI too?

00:23:52.535 --> 00:23:53.912
What type of girl do you like?

00:23:53.995 --> 00:23:56.414
- Someone like you.
- You have good taste!

00:23:56.498 --> 00:23:57.666
{\an8}NARITA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

00:23:57.749 --> 00:23:59.834
{\an8}Jun-ho seems like a nice person.

00:23:59.918 --> 00:24:02.629
You're not thinking about
doing anything weird, are you?

00:24:02.712 --> 00:24:05.966
Jun-ho and I are like brother and sister.

00:24:10.553 --> 00:24:13.265
I have something to say, so sit down.

00:24:18.687 --> 00:24:21.773
A part-time instructor position opened up

00:24:21.856 --> 00:24:24.109
at a vocational school
in Gyeonggi Province.

00:24:24.192 --> 00:24:27.696
Once you graduate, work there.

00:24:28.947 --> 00:24:30.282
Wait a second.

00:24:31.032 --> 00:24:35.245
I've been working hard
to become an animator.

00:24:35.328 --> 00:24:36.454
I know that.

00:24:36.538 --> 00:24:37.539
But you can't

00:24:37.622 --> 00:24:41.751
become one
just because you want to, right?

00:24:41.835 --> 00:24:44.296
And plus, you yourself

00:24:44.379 --> 00:24:47.632
were saying that you don't know
if you have talent.

00:24:48.216 --> 00:24:49.634
Did you forget that?

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.222
Why do you have to go out of your way

00:24:54.973 --> 00:24:57.392
to choose a difficult path?

00:25:00.854 --> 00:25:02.105
Rin, listen to me.

00:25:02.188 --> 00:25:04.441
The most important thing

00:25:04.524 --> 00:25:08.236
is to lead a stable life.

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.531
Trust your mother, okay?

00:25:11.614 --> 00:25:13.783
Just do as I say.

00:25:14.659 --> 00:25:18.455
You only have half a year
until graduation anyway.

00:25:25.211 --> 00:25:26.212
Taiga.

00:25:27.005 --> 00:25:28.506
You don't have to rush.

00:25:33.636 --> 00:25:37.223
You don't have to do
anything extraordinary.

00:25:39.392 --> 00:25:42.354
You just do
what you can to the best of your ability.

00:25:47.233 --> 00:25:48.443
Nobody…

00:25:50.236 --> 00:25:52.447
expects anything from me anymore, huh?

00:25:58.036 --> 00:26:00.538
I think that hurts the most.

00:26:11.383 --> 00:26:13.301
But Mom…

00:26:15.345 --> 00:26:16.388
Thank you.

00:27:00.515 --> 00:27:02.434
All right.

00:27:06.855 --> 00:27:07.814
Okay.

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:09.691
What?

00:27:10.233 --> 00:27:12.235
Taiga? What's wrong?

00:27:12.318 --> 00:27:14.904
TANOMI

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:18.032
I wasn't able

00:27:18.825 --> 00:27:21.494
to stand up to my mother or my brother.

00:27:24.873 --> 00:27:25.790
Thank you.

00:27:28.126 --> 00:27:30.253
My brother may be right…

00:27:32.213 --> 00:27:33.715
In the end,

00:27:35.216 --> 00:27:36.968
I haven't changed.

00:27:37.802 --> 00:27:40.722
No, I might actually be worse.

00:27:43.349 --> 00:27:44.642
What do you mean?

00:27:47.395 --> 00:27:49.147
I'm 27 already,

00:27:49.772 --> 00:27:53.109
but I've accomplished nothing
and have nothing

00:27:54.402 --> 00:27:55.737
to call my own.

00:27:57.864 --> 00:27:59.657
I'm so pathetic.

00:28:08.249 --> 00:28:09.167
Taiga.

00:28:10.043 --> 00:28:11.586
Do you have time tomorrow morning?

00:28:17.509 --> 00:28:20.136
{\an8}NARITA CITY WHOLESALE MARKET

00:28:26.726 --> 00:28:27.852
BELL PEPPERS 100 YEN

00:28:27.936 --> 00:28:29.687
{\an8}MELONS

00:28:29.771 --> 00:28:30.813
BELL PEPPERS

00:28:30.897 --> 00:28:32.357
SHINE MUSCAT

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:35.276
ORGANIC VEGETABLES - FRESH VEGETABLES

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.780
All right, maybe I'll make corn tempura
or something.

00:28:38.863 --> 00:28:39.739
Oh?

00:28:39.823 --> 00:28:41.658
- Shige?
- Hey.

00:28:41.741 --> 00:28:43.243
You're not alone today?

00:28:43.326 --> 00:28:45.286
This is Taiga, he works at my place.

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:48.081
This is Mr. Nagamori,
who I've known for over 30 years.

00:28:48.665 --> 00:28:50.542
I'm Hase. Nice to meet you.

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:53.628
The one you've been talking about?

00:28:54.462 --> 00:28:56.214
I look forward to seeing more of you.

00:28:57.423 --> 00:28:59.634
- How's today's cabbage?
- They're from Tsumagoi.

00:29:00.927 --> 00:29:04.013
- Hey, Ito.
- Hey, Shige.

00:29:04.097 --> 00:29:05.473
What's in today?

00:29:05.557 --> 00:29:09.102
Today, we have nice flounder from Aomori.

00:29:09.602 --> 00:29:11.813
- That's great. This must be…
- This is…

00:29:11.896 --> 00:29:14.065
- Two kilograms?
- Yes, 2.6 kilograms.

00:29:14.148 --> 00:29:16.484
- 2.6?
- Yes. It's very fresh.

00:29:16.568 --> 00:29:19.153
- I'll come by later.
- Okay. Thank you.

00:29:19.237 --> 00:29:20.071
FOR TANOMI

00:29:20.738 --> 00:29:22.282
Here. Flying squid.

00:29:23.449 --> 00:29:24.742
For squid, (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:29:24.826 --> 00:29:28.413
you can tell that it's fresh
when it's dark and shiny, not faded.

00:29:28.997 --> 00:29:30.290
I'll pay, so wait for me.

00:29:30.373 --> 00:29:32.542
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

00:30:26.262 --> 00:30:28.765
Everything was really cool.

00:30:29.849 --> 00:30:32.894
You and everyone at the market.

00:30:36.439 --> 00:30:38.733
I quit high school before graduating.

00:30:45.365 --> 00:30:49.369
I started working as a cook
just to make ends meet.

00:30:50.995 --> 00:30:53.122
And I just kind of continued
down that path,

00:30:53.206 --> 00:30:54.999
and found myself here.

00:31:00.213 --> 00:31:02.966
Both people and things change.

00:31:07.512 --> 00:31:10.473
Yesterday, you said that you had
nothing to call your own.

00:31:11.224 --> 00:31:12.809
But is that really so?

00:31:31.285 --> 00:31:34.038
All right, should we get some
breakfast or something?

00:31:35.164 --> 00:31:37.542
- Yes.
- Down we go.

00:31:40.378 --> 00:31:41.379
Welcome back.

00:31:46.551 --> 00:31:47.844
It's good to be back.

00:31:55.518 --> 00:31:57.103
When my family makes gimbap,

00:31:57.186 --> 00:31:59.605
we flavor the rice even before we cook it.

00:32:05.153 --> 00:32:07.697
What we put inside is not always the same.

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:09.198
But one thing we always include

00:32:09.282 --> 00:32:10.450
is bell pepper.

00:32:13.119 --> 00:32:15.288
When I was a kid,

00:32:15.371 --> 00:32:17.415
I didn't like eating vegetables,

00:32:17.999 --> 00:32:21.252
so eomma cut them up finely
and put them in gimbap.

00:32:22.628 --> 00:32:24.797
In Korea, everyone brings gimbap

00:32:24.881 --> 00:32:27.508
on field trips and sports days.

00:32:29.677 --> 00:32:31.054
So on those days,

00:32:31.137 --> 00:32:34.307
the whole house
smells good from morning and all day long.

00:32:34.807 --> 00:32:36.976
- Sounds like the best morning ever.
- Yeah.

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:39.979
So from the moment you wake up,

00:32:40.063 --> 00:32:42.356
you know that it's going to be a good day

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:44.233
and it puts a smile on your face.

00:32:45.443 --> 00:32:46.277
‪Tada.

00:32:48.946 --> 00:32:50.073
Thank you for the food.

00:32:58.122 --> 00:33:00.166
The Park family's gimbap is so kkulmat.

00:33:03.878 --> 00:33:06.923
The takuan pickles
balance out the flavors perfectly.

00:33:07.006 --> 00:33:08.049
I wonder what it is…

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:12.637
I feel like Korean takuan
has a more refreshing aftertaste.

00:33:15.473 --> 00:33:17.225
Maybe it has a stronger vinegar flavor.

00:33:18.101 --> 00:33:19.102
That's true.

00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:21.896
That's why it goes so well with rice.

00:33:23.356 --> 00:33:26.359
Sometimes we make them spicy
and eat it with rice too.

00:33:26.859 --> 00:33:28.319
It's called danmuji muchim.

00:33:28.903 --> 00:33:30.113
- I see.
- Yeah.

00:33:31.531 --> 00:33:34.158
That's danmu… danmu?

00:33:35.409 --> 00:33:37.620
Danmuji muchim.

00:33:37.703 --> 00:33:39.372
Da… danmujimuchim…

00:33:39.455 --> 00:33:42.208
- Danmuji muchim.
- Danmuji mu…?

00:33:42.291 --> 00:33:44.544
- Danmuji…
- Danmuji…?

00:33:44.627 --> 00:33:46.504
- muchim.
- muchim.

00:33:52.885 --> 00:33:54.512
That reminds me…

00:33:55.138 --> 00:33:56.597
How did it go with your brother?

00:33:59.058 --> 00:34:01.394
It didn't go well at all.

00:34:07.817 --> 00:34:11.404
But you kind of look
like a weight has been lifted.

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:13.614
‪Yeah…

00:34:15.533 --> 00:34:17.952
In the end, I'm glad that I went.

00:34:18.703 --> 00:34:22.123
I was able to remember
things that I had forgotten too.

00:34:23.583 --> 00:34:24.876
Like what?

00:34:28.004 --> 00:34:29.505
Like how my mother made me

00:34:30.548 --> 00:34:33.718
onigiri every day
when I had club activities.

00:34:34.218 --> 00:34:35.636
- Every day?
- Yeah.

00:34:37.138 --> 00:34:40.349
I'm sure it was a lot of work for her too.

00:34:42.476 --> 00:34:44.729
Rather than thinking it's a lot of work,

00:34:44.812 --> 00:34:49.108
I think she just wanted to make sure
that you weren't hungry.

00:34:56.782 --> 00:34:59.452
When I was making gimbap earlier,

00:35:00.161 --> 00:35:02.038
that's what I was thinking.

00:35:03.122 --> 00:35:07.793
I wanted you to smile,
and say that it was delicious.

00:35:09.629 --> 00:35:12.298
I'm sure your mother was the same.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.135
Maybe…

00:35:17.345 --> 00:35:19.847
I understand that feeling too.

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:22.266
I…

00:35:23.184 --> 00:35:25.519
wasn't able to live up to my
family's expectations.

00:35:26.354 --> 00:35:29.774
So I think I always had feelings of guilt.

00:35:31.859 --> 00:35:34.362
Family's expectations?

00:35:36.822 --> 00:35:38.366
I don't think that's right!

00:35:40.117 --> 00:35:41.702
What? What does that mean?

00:35:42.453 --> 00:35:44.330
I don't think it's right to push your

00:35:44.413 --> 00:35:46.832
expectations on people,
or choose their future for them.

00:35:52.546 --> 00:35:53.756
Sorry…

00:35:54.674 --> 00:35:57.385
Taiga, sorry for calling you
on your day off.

00:35:57.468 --> 00:35:58.970
The thing is, just now

00:35:59.053 --> 00:36:02.431
I got a call from the hospital
saying that my older sister collapsed.

00:36:03.182 --> 00:36:04.058
What?

00:36:04.642 --> 00:36:08.646
If possible, can you take care
of the restaurant for two or three days?

00:36:13.943 --> 00:36:16.195
Here's the flying squid sautéed
in butter and soy sauce.

00:36:17.029 --> 00:36:18.739
{\an8}- Excuse me.
- Yes?

00:36:18.823 --> 00:36:21.117
{\an8}- One oolong highball please.
- Okay.

00:36:27.164 --> 00:36:28.082
{\an8}Welcome.

00:36:28.666 --> 00:36:30.251
{\an8}Working hard?

00:36:32.086 --> 00:36:33.713
{\an8}It looks like your own restaurant!

00:36:33.796 --> 00:36:35.881
{\an8}Oh, he is someone who is
always helping me.

00:36:35.965 --> 00:36:37.383
{\an8}Mr. Sakumoto.

00:36:37.466 --> 00:36:39.343
{\an8}Hello, I'm Sakumoto.

00:36:41.804 --> 00:36:43.055
{\an8}Have a seat over here.

00:36:53.357 --> 00:36:55.401
{\an8}- Here's your stewed Koya-dofu.
- Here it is!

00:36:55.484 --> 00:36:56.652
{\an8}- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

00:36:57.445 --> 00:36:59.905
{\an8}The appetizer has a good kick to it
and is delicious.

00:37:01.282 --> 00:37:03.451
{\an8}- Thank you.
- Wow, Taiga.

00:37:03.534 --> 00:37:06.537
{\an8}Mr. Sakumoto is an expert
when it comes to food.

00:37:07.413 --> 00:37:10.541
{\an8}- Is this Korean style?
- Yes.

00:37:11.292 --> 00:37:12.752
{\an8}It's called danmuji muchim.

00:37:12.835 --> 00:37:16.505
{\an8}I mixed Korean takuan
with garlic and chili powder.

00:37:17.089 --> 00:37:21.218
{\an8}At the end, I added a bit of sesame oil
to bring the flavors together.

00:37:25.431 --> 00:37:29.894
I had heard from Mr. Ito
that you were a former athlete.

00:37:30.394 --> 00:37:32.396
I think that it's amazing how you have

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:34.273
found another path for yourself

00:37:34.357 --> 00:37:37.193
even after ending
your career as an athlete.

00:37:37.943 --> 00:37:39.945
It's not something that everyone can do.

00:37:40.654 --> 00:37:42.406
Please continue to do your best.

00:37:44.784 --> 00:37:46.327
Thank you very much.

00:37:47.828 --> 00:37:49.205
Try the Koya-dofu.

00:37:51.165 --> 00:37:54.835
‪TANOMI

00:37:57.588 --> 00:37:59.298
Thank you for treating me.

00:38:00.925 --> 00:38:02.301
Thank you very much.

00:38:03.677 --> 00:38:05.262
I'm sorry I couldn't give this earlier…

00:38:09.517 --> 00:38:11.894
I work for a company called
Neo Meal Japan,

00:38:11.977 --> 00:38:15.398
and specialize in nutrition planning
and meal management for athletes.

00:38:15.898 --> 00:38:16.982
I see…

00:38:17.858 --> 00:38:19.777
- I hope to see you again.
- Bye.

00:38:20.945 --> 00:38:21.987
{\an8}Thank you.

00:38:33.791 --> 00:38:35.501
- Taiga?
- Huh?

00:38:35.584 --> 00:38:36.627
PREVIEW

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:38.754
Are you proposing
to Onigiri Man or something?

00:38:38.838 --> 00:38:40.798
{\an8}You don't care if we're far apart, do you?

00:38:40.881 --> 00:38:43.134
