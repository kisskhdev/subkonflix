=Episode 20=
(This story is purely fictional)

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.670
This video was obviously
made by someone

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.030
Zhou Muyan hired to smear us.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.580
I'm going to Fingle right now
to beat him up.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.990
Scoundrel!

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.060
Don't.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.030
For crying out loud!

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.670
I swear I'll mess Zhou Muyan up.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.502
Alright, calm down.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.110
I must punch him now.

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:05.700
(Looks like)

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.990
(this "Da" company isn't that serious
about making games.)

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:10.420
(There's barely any visible marketing.)

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.950
(Who knows where the money went?)

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.700
Don't act impulsively.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.670
You can't hit people.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:19.950
If you do, we're in the wrong.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:20.830
Yes.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:21.580
Get a lawyer.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.110
Sue him.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.420
Lin Wan, don't worry.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.860
The internet remembers.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.702
I'll repost Zhou Muyan
yelling at employees

00:02:27.724 --> 00:02:29.350
at Sky Fire another 200 times.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.140
Yes.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.190
Let's see if everyone knows
what kind of person he is.

00:02:32.191 --> 00:02:33.740
You led us to plan

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.350
the Divine Mountains and Seas.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.580
How do you want to fight back?

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.670
We'll all follow you.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.110
Follow.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.230
Yes, we'll do what you want.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:41.740
Thank you.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.510
As long as you're here,

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.350
I won't be affected.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:46.900
Don't worry.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.740
I'll have the legal
issue a clarification now.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.302
We can't let him slander us again.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.300
The key issue now

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.070
is how we save
the Divine Mountains and Seas.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.140
If this keeps up,

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.620
it'll really go down.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.510
We need to think about

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.390
how to turn this around.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.270
Easy.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.900
He slandered us,

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.020
so we just slandered him back.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.790
Isn't it just spending money? Spend it.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:07.550
Don't be impulsive.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.860
How dare someone like him
brag about his game?

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.140
He'll crash sooner or later.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.670
This time,

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.020
it's really brains vs brawn.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.390
Zhou Muyan

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.140
has already

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.510
written our script for us.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.790
Here. I'll stop writing
Northern Continent for now.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.550
I'll craft a story for him.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:23.550
- That works.
- Yes.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.990
I'll post that video of his.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.740
Follow

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.070
his persona and arrange it.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.140
Heaven closes one door,

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.700
but opens another window.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.140
Zhou Muyan showed up again.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.860
You must seize this new chance.

00:03:39.235 --> 00:03:41.350
The Divine Mountains and Seas
is already online.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.110
You've done right by them.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.350
Stop dwelling on it.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.620
You owe no one.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:52.180
Wait.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.550
That expression looks off.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.020
You aren't thinking of joining them

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.700
to go after Zhou Muyan, are you?

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.700
You're really something.

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:05.790
We're done.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:06.990
He's softening again.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.390
Get ready to drive forever.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.270
Wake up.

00:04:10.368 --> 00:04:11.924
If the Divine Mountains and Seas wins,

00:04:11.991 --> 00:04:13.070
we'll have no way

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.420
to get Sima's bonus.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.300
- There's no way.
- There's no way.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.350
- No way.
- No way.

00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:25.110
- There's no way.
- There's no way.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.260
In this world,

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.230
we can have one less
so-called good game.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.030
But I

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.110
won't let people
who truly gave their all

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.260
be let down.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.110
Here.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.030
Comrades.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.940
No matter what,

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.590
we must spend on promotion.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.470
We absolutely can't lose to Zhou Muyan.

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:09.180
I agree.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.230
I agree.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.670
Yes.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:11.550
Yes.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:12.860
100% agree.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:13.940
Lin Wan, what do you think?

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.300
The company has already invested a lot

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.260
in developing
the Divine Mountains and Seas.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.670
Let's see what Mr. Pei says.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.790
Lin Wan, look at everyone's enthusiasm.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:29.470
Sure. OK.

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.790
No problem.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.060
Mr. Pei

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.260
will definitely agree.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.380
Amazing, Mr. Pei.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.300
Mr. Pei.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.990
Amazing.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.110
Mr. Pei is the best!

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.990
Mr. Pei

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.620
will definitely agree.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.940
Awesome.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.620
He'll agree for sure.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:45.500
Absolutely no problem.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.940
That Zhou Muyan went too far.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:47.990
He's a real jerk.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.740
Yeah.

00:05:48.768 --> 00:05:49.946
You know what just happened?

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.740
Totally at ease.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:51.380
You have no idea.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.990
Yeah.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.940
This time, you...

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.820
Leave it to me.

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.060
You're not her match.

00:06:03.257 --> 00:06:04.590
Xin, this time, no matter what...

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:05.300
Move aside.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:10.670
The budget is approved.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.260
Don't lose to someone like Zhou Muyan.

00:06:17.635 --> 00:06:19.324
For the Divine Mountains and Seas,

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:20.500
the budget

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.590
has no limit.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.740
No limit.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:25.670
Wait and see.

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:26.350
I'll go

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:27.820
and make 800 marketing plans.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.940
We must win this promotional campaign.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.990
Sibo won't let you down!

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:33.420
Awesome!

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:34.740
Let's go!

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.550
- Alright.
- Let's go. Come on.

Mr. Pei, I'm sorry.

Sibo let you down.

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.820
We planned so many strategies

00:07:07.857 --> 00:07:09.413
and reached out to all kinds of creators

00:07:09.457 --> 00:07:10.550
and video bloggers,

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:12.150
but they all said their schedule

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.968
is full for the year.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.110
They can't take new jobs.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:15.500
Zhou Muyan

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.180
really went all out.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.500
Attacking Tengda is now the trend.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.110
Anyone speaking for us gets attacked.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.260
Smaller accounts
that didn't receive the job

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.230
dare not speak either.

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:24.191
They can only observe.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.060
This time,

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.910
they're really trying to kill us.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:30.260
It's fine.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.260
This isn't your fault.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.740
We'll think of a solution together.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.300
Since online marketing won't work,

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.500
we'll go offline.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.710

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:38.990

Alright, Mr. Pei.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.500
We'll keep pushing.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.620
But there's good news, Mr. Pei.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.910

Yes, Fuhui has grown strong lately,

but what about you?

00:12:52.924 --> 00:12:54.500

more and more about connections

Sacrificing the small to save the big

Got it, Dad.

00:13:16.857 --> 00:13:18.260
Fingle is wealthy and powerful.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.430
Once the game launched,
it crushed Tengda.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.230
Isn't it because Tengda is new

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:23.500
and took some of your market?

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:25.500
But, Dad,

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.070
I think what we should consider now

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:29.660
isn't how to monopolize.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:30.740
What we should think about

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.500
is how to make it bigger.

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:33.350
Isn't that right?

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:35.620
If an industry

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.140
has only one player,

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:38.430
that industry

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:40.070
is truly finished.

This is our last chance.

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:23.230

to be this resilient.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:50.740
(One G is missing.)

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:52.110
(They can't even spell)

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:53.350
(their own name correctly.)

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.070
(You can see that it's full of bugs.)

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:57.740
(And Tengda's abbreviation is TD.)
[*"TD" can stand for "unsubscribe" in Chinese. ]

00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.310
(It obviously means unsubscribe.)

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:02.260
How childish.

00:15:02.613 --> 00:15:04.213
There's something even more childish.

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:05.470
Look.

00:15:05.546 --> 00:15:07.710
(Expert Who Can't Soar)
The new set by Infinite Imagination

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:09.590
is called Expert Who Can't Soar.

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:11.110
This is too much.

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:12.590
Let's make one, too.

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:13.350
Make

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:15.020
a dull, lifeless rock.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:16.350
They attack Tengda,

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:17.470
and you scold their leader.

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:18.740
Wouldn't that make it easier

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:19.900
for them to find faults?

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:24.110
Then what should we do?

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:26.990
It seems
Fingle hasn't done anything wrong.

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:28.360
They made a game for the first time

00:15:28.368 --> 00:15:29.670
and were led astray by Zhou Muyan.

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:31.260
Didn't Mr. Pei say

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:32.590
those attacking us

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:33.590
are just minor nuisances?

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:35.070
Just ignore them.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:40.900
Wait.

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:42.230
Now

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:43.350
it's no longer minor.

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:44.230
Look.

00:15:44.791 --> 00:15:46.860
I searched
the Divine Mountains and Seas online.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:48.435
All results are Infinite Imagination.

00:15:48.591 --> 00:15:49.590
What does this mean?

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:53.020
Did they block our keywords?

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.020
They actually did.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.880
Anything
about the Divine Mountains and Seas

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.140
shows Infinite Imagination.

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:05.230
This tactic is too shady.

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:07.140
Check Net blocked us.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:07.950
Check Net

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:09.500
dominates all search engines.

00:16:09.546 --> 00:16:11.560
If everyone searches
the Divine Mountains and Seas,

00:16:11.568 --> 00:16:12.768
it automatically redirects

00:16:12.768 --> 00:16:14.110
to Infinite Imagination's results.

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:16.660
That'll cause us big trouble.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.500
Zhou Muyan clearly did this.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.110
Our data just started to rise,

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:22.457
and he played dirty tricks again.

00:16:22.502 --> 00:16:23.590
Though not clever,

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:25.070
it's effective.

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:27.350
They probably aren't just messing

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:28.368
with the search engines.

00:16:28.435 --> 00:16:29.260
I'll check elsewhere.

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.780
We're likely

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.020
blocked on other websites too.

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:41.990
Everyone.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.620
Something happened again.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.180
(Conference Room)

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:48.350
Now it's not just Check Net.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.110
Almost on all social platforms

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:52.230
and short video platforms,
our traffic can't rise.

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:53.350
I asked Mr. Qiao.

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:54.380
He said this is called

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.435
traffic limiting,
keyword blocking, or something.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.140
Our keywords have been blocked.

00:16:58.900 --> 00:16:59.924
Mainly, we haven't had

00:16:59.924 --> 00:17:02.350
any binding cooperation
with other platforms.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:03.302
We're indeed passive now.

00:17:03.302 --> 00:17:05.280
Once everyone searches
the Divine Mountains and Seas,

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.130
it automatically links
to Infinite Imagination.

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:09.100
Why does Zhou Muyan

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:10.470
have so many despicable tricks?

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:12.710
How much did he pay these companies?

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:14.230
We pay double, triple,

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:15.710
and make them block them online!

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:17.230
If we do this,

00:17:17.235 --> 00:17:18.540
how are we different from him?

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:20.950
It's different.

00:17:21.213 --> 00:17:23.780
Mr. Pei, the Divine Mountains and Seas
is the fruit of our labor.

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:25.060
We must win this time.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.020
Sibo.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:31.300
Look at you.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.430
Working 9-to-6 every day,

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:33.780
your eye bags are huge.

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.740
Is it different from overtime
at the old company?

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:37.430
Everyday, Infinite Imagination

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:39.100
updates, gives benefits,

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.990
and updates for big gift packs.

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:41.990
My upgrade resource pack

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.910
must keep up,

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:44.430
or users won't stay.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:45.230
Lv.

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.060
How long has it been
since you left on time?

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.780
Aren't you supposed to be a slasher?

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:50.950
No time for that now.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.020
Zhou Muyan is full of dirty tricks.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:54.740
And you.

00:17:54.857 --> 00:17:56.020
I don't even want to say it.

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:57.740
You lose your temper thrice a day now.

00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:59.060
What? Ate gunpowder?

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:01.540
I'm not losing my temper, Mr. Pei.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:02.910
Look online.

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:04.340
It's full of bad reviews.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:05.100
Look.

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.060
(Does Tengda think they're all that)

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:08.190
(because some of their games succeed?)

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:09.670
(They think their products
are guaranteed hits?)

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:10.950
(When it comes to big games, we can see)

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:12.430
(the real production level
of some companies.)

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:14.230
(I suggest playing Infinite Imagination.)

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:15.020
Mr. Pei.

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:16.820
I understand your point.

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:17.630
Of course, we can't

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:19.260
be like Zhou Muyan and his kind.

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:22.230
But if we don't act, what about
the Divine Mountains and Seas?

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:23.670
Do we just watch them

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:25.260
suppress us?

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:26.540
Yeah.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:27.540
Look.

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:33.150
I know.

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:35.740
Everyone gave their all
to the Divine Mountains and Seas.

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.430
It's indeed a good game.

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:39.020
Everyone has high expectations for it.

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:41.020
So, getting this feedback after launch,

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:41.780
everyone is angry.

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:42.670
Me too.

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:44.300
But are these comments

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:45.630
only from

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:46.990
Zhou Muyan's slander?

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:49.060
Mr. Pei,

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:50.630
if you put it that way,

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:51.820
you reminded me.

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:53.740
When I was at Sky Fire,

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.060
I already felt it.

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:56.060
Think about it.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:57.300
Tengda,

00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:58.780
a new company,

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:01.020
made four games that all succeeded.

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:02.950
Competitors are watching.

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:04.190
The Divine Mountains and Seas

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:05.580
is our first

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.260
large-scale multiplayer online game.

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:09.910
Many veteran game companies

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:11.260
already disliked us.

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.146
So they waited for Zhou Muyan
to spread rumors,

00:19:13.146 --> 00:19:14.500
and everyone piled on.

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:17.150
Lin Wan.

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:19.430
Do you remember I asked you

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:21.020
why you like making games?

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.340
Reality is sometimes too heavy.

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:27.500
We want a safe harbor

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:29.020
and a utopia.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:33.060
Yes.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:35.230
Life

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:37.300
can suffocate people.

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.990
You can't escape it,

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.500
but we can nap

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:43.580
and dream.

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:45.500
You have ideals

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:46.710
and emotions.

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:48.230
I believe you can do it.

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:53.950
Because games

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:55.780
can let many people

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.820
momentarily forget the harsh reality.

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:01.540
Now,

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:04.430
can it still make you forget
reality's troubles?

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:11.260
A creation

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.230
is actually the creators'

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:14.990
true emotional vessel

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:16.150
and reflection.

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:17.470
But look.

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:20.100
Everyone is full of worries every day,

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:21.190
trapped in marketing wars.

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:22.020
Can we

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:24.020
still create happiness for players?

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:24.950
We now

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:26.260
betray our original intention

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:27.740
and drift farther away.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:33.100
If games

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.150
want to attract players,

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:37.540
they can only rely on heartfelt content

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:38.910
and new gameplay.

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.820
We should

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.430
calm down and think about

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:44.470
what we can do
for the Divine Mountains and Seas.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:46.910
Is it just about defeating
a mere Zhou Muyan?

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:48.190
Zhou Muyan's nothing.

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:49.300
Trash.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:50.780
He's an industry parasite.

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:53.300
People like Zhou Muyan

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:54.500
will never disappear.

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:56.580
If we want a real rival,

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:58.500
there's only one.

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:00.670
It's ourselves.

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:15.540
I saw a comment saying

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.910
there are too many newbie tasks.

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:18.870
They're right.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.060
I recently thought about it carefully.

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:23.470
We set up
many gameplay features and characters,

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:25.430
pushing them all to players at once.

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:27.150
This makes newbie tasks

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:28.300
tedious and long.

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:30.870
I take responsibility for this.

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:31.950
When I played earlier,

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:33.580
I felt the time in the newbie village

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:34.302
was too long.

00:21:34.324 --> 00:21:35.540
I couldn't enter the main map.

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:38.340
Bao, you should have mentioned it
during the test play.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:39.870
I thought it was a minor issue.

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:41.324
Because once you get to the main map,

00:21:41.346 --> 00:21:42.150
it's really fun.

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:43.710
You enlightened me.

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:45.820
I think it's similar
to writing a script.

00:21:46.102 --> 00:21:47.710
If the story background is too complex,

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.990
the audience abandons it.

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:49.580
Right?

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:50.430
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:51.260
Exactly.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:52.580
Then I'll optimize the program.

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:53.820
I'll put those gift packs and XP

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:55.100
into the tasks.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:56.740
Will this improve the player experience?

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:57.710
Definitely.

00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:59.470
Another optimization method

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:01.430
is to let players

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:02.630
interact with the real world

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:04.013
in the Divine Mountains and Seas.

00:22:04.013 --> 00:22:04.724
For example,

00:22:04.724 --> 00:22:06.100
when players reach a restaurant

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.480
in the Divine Mountains and Seas map,

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.770
they can actually order takeout

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:10.910
and have it delivered to them
in real life.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.500
Good idea.

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.230
This really breaks
the dimensional barrier.

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:15.390
This can work, right?

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:16.500
No problem.

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:16.950
Huang.

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:17.968
Can we have players

00:22:17.991 --> 00:22:20.013
read Zhongdian Web Fiction novels
in-game?

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.260
That should be fine.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:23.150
Don't we

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:24.500
have a wishing pool area?

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:25.710
Can players

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:27.150
directly message Mr. Ma's

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:29.020
Dreams Fulfilled Immediately account?

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:30.150
- Yes.
- Yes!

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:32.500
Adding real-world interaction
like this makes it even more fun.

00:22:32.502 --> 00:22:33.100
Of course.

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:34.540
I also have an idea.

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:35.910
When I play the game,

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:36.950
there's a character

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:37.990
with a really long face

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:39.470
and very small eyes.

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:40.630
I think it doesn't look good.

00:22:40.635 --> 00:22:41.540
Let's ask our art team

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:42.990
to fix it up first.

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:43.500
Can we...

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:44.540
Lin Wan, let me tell you.

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:45.470
Well... No.

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:46.230
Can we...

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:47.060
This way...

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:47.470
This...

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:48.500
This...

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:51.710
Wait...

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.020
Isn't being ugly a problem?

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:54.910
Being ugly.

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.740
Shouldn't we reflect on that too?

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:04.140
(Stay true to our mission,
succeed for the greater good.)

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:05.260
Ms. Lin Wan.

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:06.368
Thank you for your hard work.

00:23:06.391 --> 00:23:07.470
- Ms. Lin Wan.
- Ms. Lin Wan.

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:08.500
Ms. Lin Wan.

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.013
Thank you for your hard work. Yada.

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:11.230
Comrades.

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:12.100
Infinite Imagination

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.230
is still increasing player benefits.

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:15.150
Listen up.

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.230
Hello, players.

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:19.546
To thank you for loving and supporting
Infinite Imagination,

00:23:19.591 --> 00:23:20.630
starting today,

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.990
anyone who registers
Infinite Imagination

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:23.820
will receive

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:24.740
discounts on downloads

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:27.060
for other games published by Fingle.

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.213
(Infinite Imagination)
Log in and play over two hours

00:23:29.213 --> 00:23:30.340
for seven consecutive days,

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:32.260
and you can download other Fingle games

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:34.150
for free.

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.235
Fingle really went all out.

00:23:36.235 --> 00:23:38.500
They spend money to promote
other games they represent,

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.440
bleeding funds
to support Infinite Imagination.

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:41.710
Don't worry about them.

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:44.430
Just focus on our own work.

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:46.470
Remember what Mr. Pei said?

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:48.591
- Surpass yourself.
- Surpass yourself.

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.150
Back to work.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:52.910
Wei.

00:23:52.968 --> 00:23:54.500
Have the newbie missions been optimized?

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:55.580
We simplified them.

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:56.910
They're no longer cumbersome.

00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:58.060
Yeah.

00:23:58.060 --> 00:23:59.340
The game's trial experience

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:00.300
is much better now.

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:01.500
Lv, Yada.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:02.540
Is it okay on your end?

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:04.910
Mr. Pei really reminded me.

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:06.230
I was only writing code,

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:07.870
completely ignoring player feedback.

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:09.670
We need to communicate more with PMs.

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:10.630
Don't worry.

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:12.213
I've put all the rewards and gift packs

00:24:12.235 --> 00:24:12.990
into the missions.

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:14.430
Fully coordinating with Lv.

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:15.710
The update will go live soon.

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:17.300
Mr. Pei is right.

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:19.580
A game attracts players with gameplay.

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.060
We should let players

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.300
focus on enjoying the game.

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.470
Everything goes back to the game itself.

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:30.260
I've modified it.

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:32.630
(Are people still playing
the Divine Mountains and Seas?)

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:34.230
(Seems like they quietly updated it.)

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:36.820
(How smooth. Tengda actually listened.)

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:39.260
(All the parts
we complained about are fixed.)

00:24:39.346 --> 00:24:41.435
(I ordered takeout in
the Divine Mountains and Seas.)

00:24:41.457 --> 00:24:44.540
(Half an hour later,
it actually arrived.)

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:46.710
(Tengda. Amazing.)

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:48.780
(Tengda, what god-tier move is this?)

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:50.500
(You can read web novels in-game?)

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:53.870
(Zhongdian Web Fiction's novels
are a bit abstracted,)

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:56.870
(but the process of collecting
fragments is interesting.)

00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:59.319
(The real-world collab in
the Divine Mountains and Seas)

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.613
(is incredible.)

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:01.910
ID.

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:04.150
Can't Compare to Boran.

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:06.390
The Divine Mountains and Seas, Zone 49,

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:08.500
Revelers' Zone. Takeout has arrived.

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:09.300
Whose is it?

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:11.260
Mine.

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.020
Coming.

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:18.540
(The Divine Mountains and Seas)

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:21.060
It's out.

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:22.060
The fragment dropped.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:24.390
(The CEO Has an Exclusive Crush on You)
You got a fragment to read

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:25.580
the extra chapter
of Chit & Chat's novel.

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:27.340
I've always wanted
to read this extra chapter.

00:25:27.346 --> 00:25:28.902
But in The Divine Mountains and Seas,

00:25:28.902 --> 00:25:30.020
fragments drop randomly.

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.190
Each player gets different texts.

00:25:32.257 --> 00:25:34.235
Which dungeon
did you get this fragment from?

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:36.540
(The Divine Mountains and Seas
launched a wishing mode,)

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:37.870
(collaborating
with Dreams Fulfilled Immediately.)

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.870
(Attention.
Dreams Fulfilled Immediately)

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:40.910
(no longer receive private messages.)

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:42.710
(Use the wishing pool
in the Divine Mountains and Seas.)

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:43.630
(I tested it, and it works.)

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:44.710
(The Divine Mountains and Seas)

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:46.391
Travelers
of the Divine Mountains and Seas.

00:25:46.391 --> 00:25:47.020
Don't worry.

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:47.740
So far,

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:50.060
we've received
tens of thousands of wishes

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:51.230
from travelers.

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:52.780
(Please give us a little more time.)

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:53.740
(We'll help everyone...)

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:55.150
(We'll help... We...)

00:25:55.613 --> 00:25:57.702
(We'll help everyone
fulfill their wishes one by one.)

00:25:57.746 --> 00:25:58.950
(Stay tuned)

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:00.430
(to the Divine Mountains and Seas.)

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:02.780
(Scan the QR code to download.)

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:06.540
Ms. Tang.

00:26:06.591 --> 00:26:07.768
This player wants a free meal

00:26:07.768 --> 00:26:09.260
from the private kitchen. Approve?

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:10.060
No problem, approved.

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:11.060
Ms. Tang.

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:12.990
This player wants to join Tengda.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:13.829
How should we reply?

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:15.020
Thank them for their interest.

00:26:15.035 --> 00:26:15.910
And tell them to follow

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:17.260
the recruitment info online.

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.060
Oh, right.

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:19.924
Give them
a few more sets of game equipment.

00:26:19.924 --> 00:26:20.546
Got it.

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:21.540
Ms. Tang.

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:23.540
This player wants Lu Zhiyao's autograph.

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:28.500
Mr. Lu, I'm here to visit.

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:30.150
I need your help with something.

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:39.580
Mr. Lu.

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:40.340
Well...

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:42.500
Could you provide
some autographed photos

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.346
for the Divine Mountains and Seas
players?

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:49.990
Originally,

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:51.990
I added a few lines to your character.

00:26:52.102 --> 00:26:55.470
But after thinking it through, it's
better to add them to Shi Huo instead.

00:27:00.302 --> 00:27:02.724
You add a few lines of dialogue,
and I'll sign a few autographs.

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:06.630
(Tang_Student)
(I really got Lu Zhiyao's autograph!)

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:07.946
(- I want one too.
- Me too!)

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:13.710
Is that how you film vertical videos?

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.780
You just rotate the monitor vertically.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:18.230
Where's everyone?

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:19.740
Where's everyone?

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:21.780
Mr. Shi.

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:23.302
No, what's the rush in calling me over?

00:27:23.324 --> 00:27:24.430
I can't amend the script.

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:26.340
Why should Lu Zhiyao's autograph

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:27.260
be used as a gift?

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:30.340
It's Mr. Lu.

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:31.780
He offered it voluntarily.

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:33.470
I'm not voluntary?

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:34.950
I'll also provide some.

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:39.340
Enough.

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:40.870
Enough.

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:42.300
I believe many friends

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.260
already received...

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:45.740
(autographs from Shi Huo and Lu Zhiyao.)

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:47.870
This collab in
the Divine Mountains and Seas

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:50.190
breaks the barrier between
reality and the game world.

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:51.580
(Do you still have extra autographs?)
(Completely)

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:53.260
(Can Mr. Qiao draw me too?)
(connecting them.)

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:55.260
(Truly an industry miracle.)

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:00.710
Okay, no problem.

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:01.100
Mr. Zhou.

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:02.300
Mr. Zhou.

00:28:04.035 --> 00:28:04.990
Continue optimizing.

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:07.260
What's up?

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:08.950
Tengda released a new update,

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.100
fixing several
previously criticized points

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:12.100
and also implemented

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:13.409
an internal collab between the game

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:15.020
and Tengda's ecosystem
to attract players.

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:15.780
Looks like

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:16.580
it's working.

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:23.910
Then find a way to suppress it.

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:25.820
But the budget...

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:28.020
Eric

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:29.060
might not give us

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:30.190
that much support.

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:31.500
After all,

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:32.470
Fingle

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:33.710
isn't ours either.

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:43.390
Just ignore it.

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:45.060
Keep going.

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:47.150
As for Eric,

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:48.390
I'll convince him.

00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:58.710
Come in.

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:06.740
Yada.

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:08.020
Want something to eat?

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:09.060
I'll order some takeout.

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:10.020
Later.

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:11.300
Wait until I finish this.

00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:16.300
After the update releases,

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:17.820
new players will start coming in.

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:19.740
We have to optimize the program quickly

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:20.910
to ensure smooth gameplay.

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:22.100
Speed it up.

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:23.100
Okay.

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:25.500
I missed mealtime again.

00:29:25.568 --> 00:29:27.430
I'm so hungry
that I'm getting hypoglycemic.

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:30.500
I'm so hungry.

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:31.820
Everyone.

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:33.340
You'll only

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:34.902
have energy to work after you eat.

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:36.300
Snacks alone won't do.

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:38.230
You need quality protein.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.870
Here it comes.

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.820
Here it comes.

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:50.990
Here.

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:52.430
Put them here.

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:54.020
Everyone.

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:55.630
From today on,

00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:57.190
your meals

00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:58.870
will be provided

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:00.470
by the private kitchen.

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:02.470
Don't just stay there.

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:03.500
Come over and eat.

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:04.470
Come.

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:05.190
Hurry up, come on.

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:06.260
It's fine, come on.

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:09.060
Everything's delicious.

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:11.020
How is it?

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:12.060
Come on.

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:12.580
There's more.

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:13.500
There's some here too.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.060
Eat that one. That steak is good.

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:19.500
Everyone.

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:21.430
I have more good news to announce.

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:23.990
Mr. Ma, Director Zhuang, and Sibo

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:26.780
have contacted a popular anime IP.

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:27.950
The rights holder tried out

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:29.230
the Divine Mountains and Seas

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:30.502
and thought it was excellent,

00:30:30.502 --> 00:30:31.540
so they've decided

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.100
to collaborate with us.

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:35.500
- Great!
- Great!

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:39.100
Thank you all.

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.150
Our shoot

00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:42.260
won't start anytime soon.

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:44.235
Director Zhuang and I
don't have much to do,

00:30:44.257 --> 00:30:45.470
so we came to help out.

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:46.500
Thanks, Huang.

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:48.190
Well,

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:49.470
the game

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:51.430
is connected to film and TV,

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:52.390
so I was thinking

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:54.820
maybe I could help expand it

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:55.946
from a story perspective.

00:30:55.991 --> 00:30:56.990
Not now.

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.710
Eat first.

00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:58.580
Yes.

00:30:58.580 --> 00:30:59.740
We'll expand later.

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.500
Eat first.

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:01.670
Eat up.

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:03.990
Sibo. You've done a great job
with this game.

00:31:04.035 --> 00:31:05.702
The rights
to the Divine Mountains and Seas

00:31:05.746 --> 00:31:06.540
are with you, right?

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:07.780
We have to do film and TV.

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:08.780
I'll go talk to Mr. Pei.

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:09.546
Stop right there.

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:10.580
Stop it.

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:13.780
This isn't open yet.

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:14.340
Everyone.

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:15.470
Good news.

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:17.191
Check Net,
several social media platforms

00:31:17.191 --> 00:31:18.740
and short-video platforms
that blocked us

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:19.768
are all sorted out now.

00:31:19.813 --> 00:31:21.780
We hadn't officially partnered before,

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:23.500
so we used this opportunity

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:24.500
to sign

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:26.150
new strategic cooperation agreements.

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:27.870
Now you can find

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:28.470
information

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:30.710
about the Divine Mountains and Seas
on all platforms.

00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:35.910
Come.

00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:37.300
Lin Wan, eat first.

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:38.020
Come eat.

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:39.300
You worked hard.

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:40.020
Everything's good.

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:42.820
Steak.

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:44.390
There's more. Looks delicious.

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:45.168
This steak is good.

00:31:45.213 --> 00:31:46.260
This is perfect for ladies.

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:47.910
Hardly any oil at all.

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:48.540
This one's good.

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:49.500
That one's fine too.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:50.500
Eat more.

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:51.340
Eat up.

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.100
Eat more.

(Infinite Imagination was fun at first,)

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:00.540
(but later it's just bad.)

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:01.710
(The gameplay's repetitive,)

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:02.820

they didn't put in effort.)

(Who knows where the money went?)

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:09.391
(They should've paid me.
I'd do a better job than them.)

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.020
(In the end, it's about the game itself.)

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:13.260
(When competing in games,
quality is above all.)

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:14.480

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.910
(you couldn't find the Divine Mountains
and Seas on Check Net.)

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:18.670
(It was definitely Fingle's doing.)

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.020
(It's finally fixed now.)

00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:22.020
(Tengda wouldn't
pull such dirty tricks.)

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:22.870
(I officially announce)

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:24.300
(unconditional support for Tengda.)

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:25.910
(I support
the Divine Mountains and Seas.)

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:28.740

As long as you increase my budget
a little more,

00:32:51.835 --> 00:32:53.920
I can definitely beat
the Divine Mountains and Seas.

00:32:53.924 --> 00:32:54.910
I will beat them.

00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:56.500
Eric. Give me one more chance.

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:56.990
Mr. Zhou.

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:58.020

Mr. Zhou.

I'm not here to discuss that.

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:05.630
This is no longer about
whether to increase the budget.

After verification by all departments,

These malicious actions

have crossed the bottom line

of game marketing practices.

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:25.702
Relevant authorities require our
cooperation with the investigation.

They don't know anything.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:29.630
This is just normal marketing.

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:30.780
Just tactics.

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:33.910
Sorry.

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:34.630
I'm sorry.

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:36.470
Sorry.

00:33:36.546 --> 00:33:37.390
Don't worry, I will...

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:39.260
I... I'll explain everything clearly.

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:41.390
I'm afraid it's already too late.

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:43.780
This incident

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:46.740
has caused serious damage

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:48.670
to Fingle, to me,

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:51.300
and to my father.

00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:57.430
You've been in this industry
a long time.

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:01.190
I hope

00:34:02.791 --> 00:34:04.190
you can see the bigger picture.

00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:34.620
I understand.

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.830
Eric.

00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:55.990
I... I'll explain everything clearly.

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:03.060
This was all my personal behavior.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:06.870
It has nothing to do with the company.

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:28.310
Mr. Zhou.

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:41.540
Xuming.

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:43.990
I've dragged you down.

00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:45.990
Mr. Zhou, don't say that.

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:47.660
All these years,

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:49.470
you've always taken good care of me.

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:53.180
Work hard.

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:54.500
There will be other chances.

00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:57.660
As for me,

00:35:58.270 --> 00:35:59.540
there's probably

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:03.270
no chance left in this industry.

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:14.390
Xuming.

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:17.540
You've followed me for years.

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:18.140
At this point,

00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:19.540
tell me the truth.

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.180
Where exactly am I worse than Pei Qian?

00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:27.060
Why would you think that, Mr. Zhou?

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:27.950
You're outstanding.

00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:29.350
How is he even comparable to you?

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.270
But ever since Pei Qian appeared,

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:32.220
my life

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:33.950
has felt like hitting a wall.

00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:37.060
You've seen it all.

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:38.700
I've always worked diligently,

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:39.870
never daring to slack off.

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:42.060
I always met
every request from my superiors.

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:43.910
Do you think those projects

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:45.830
were ones I wanted to do?

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:48.270
Every project the group assigned me

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:50.310
was a tough nut to crack.

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:52.910
But no matter how hard they were,

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:54.660
didn't Sky Fire

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:55.540
always complete them

00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:57.500
seriously and thoroughly?

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:00.310
We also became

00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:01.990
the most efficient studio
in the industry.

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:03.620
But now,

00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:05.790
I don't even know how I lost.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:07.270
Mr. Zhou.

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:10.020
Pei Qian knows nothing.

00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:11.470
He's just lucky.

00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:12.660
A fluke.

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:13.660
Pure dumb luck.

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:20.580
Xuming.

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:22.390
I'll trouble you

00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:24.660
to send me one last time.

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:25.390
Okay.

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:26.310
Where to?

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:42.620
(Shenhua International)

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:01.020
Qian.

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:08.270
Dreams Fulfilled Immediately.

00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:46.910
Well...

00:38:47.857 --> 00:38:48.500
Where is he?

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:49.220
What's wrong?

00:38:51.368 --> 00:38:52.524
I must have been mistaken.

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:53.470
I thought...

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:54.220
It's nothing.

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:57.020
I must get revenge today,
I'm telling you.

00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:04.870
Hello, everyone.

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:06.020
Welcome to

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:07.480
What Happens in the Gaming Industry?

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:09.140
Recently, Fingle has been suspected of

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:10.540
malicious commercial competition,

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:11.950
drawing widespread attention.

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:14.750
The relevant authorities will launch
a rectification campaign,

00:39:14.768 --> 00:39:17.220
focusing on self-media accounts
chasing traffic without limits,

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:18.430
spreading false information,

00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:19.700
inciting hostility and abuse,

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:21.413
and other online misconduct.

00:39:21.435 --> 00:39:23.750
Relevant regulations will
be issued to strictly punish

00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:26.020
seriously problematic
and non-compliant platforms,

00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:28.870
actively maintaining a clean,
harmonious online environment.
