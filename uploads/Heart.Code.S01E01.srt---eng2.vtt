OnStream.cam

00:01:52.165 --> 00:01:54.745
Ms. Vicky, the shop is full of customers.

00:01:55.475 --> 00:01:56.425
Okay.

00:02:04.065 --> 00:02:05.025
Want to take a photo?

00:02:08.315 --> 00:02:11.145
- This cake looks delicious!
- This place is adorable.

00:02:11.635 --> 00:02:12.705
Congratulations.

00:02:13.525 --> 00:02:14.665
Happy for you!

00:02:14.805 --> 00:02:17.185
Thank you very much. Congrats!

00:02:17.805 --> 00:02:20.345
- Wishing you prosperity.
- Congrats on the new shop!

00:02:20.605 --> 00:02:22.785
Thank you. Please, make
yourself comfortable.

00:02:23.085 --> 00:02:23.865
Ing.

00:02:24.205 --> 00:02:26.225
Please take the guest
to the reception room.

00:02:26.675 --> 00:02:27.465
This way, sir.

00:02:28.005 --> 00:02:29.265
Welcome.

00:02:29.795 --> 00:02:31.145
This shop is beautiful!

00:02:32.035 --> 00:02:33.465
Wow, this shop is beautiful!

00:02:34.115 --> 00:02:36.305
Dad, have you landed?

00:02:37.155 --> 00:02:39.625
Hurry up! The reporters are coming!

00:02:40.195 --> 00:02:41.505
I'll go greet the guests now.

00:02:41.675 --> 00:02:43.465
Alright, get to work, sweetie.

00:02:43.805 --> 00:02:44.705
See you soon.

00:02:46.845 --> 00:02:47.945
- Sir.
- Hmm.

00:02:48.955 --> 00:02:50.145
Should I go buy it for you?

00:02:50.285 --> 00:02:52.625
Oh, I'm here. I’ll pick it out myself.

00:02:53.395 --> 00:02:55.985
My daughter has her own style.

00:03:47.955 --> 00:03:50.225
- Hey, take care of this.
- Got it, boss.

00:03:50.795 --> 00:03:53.585
Hey A, go get the lotus for Lert.

00:03:53.795 --> 00:03:54.465
- Okay.
- Boss, customer's here.

00:03:54.645 --> 00:03:55.265
Alright everyone.

00:03:55.445 --> 00:03:56.265
Hurry up. Go.

00:03:56.375 --> 00:03:59.625
Captain Tarn has been
gathering information

00:03:59.765 --> 00:04:02.865
by going undercover
as an employee at a lotus shop.

00:04:03.235 --> 00:04:04.585
For three months.

00:04:06.205 --> 00:04:10.025
Leading us to
a major drug dealer's operation.

00:04:10.635 --> 00:04:12.785
Scattered throughout the market.

00:04:13.045 --> 00:04:18.225
These dealers hide the drugs inside
the flowers kept in crates and baskets.

00:04:20.435 --> 00:04:22.985
If this arrest goes smoothly.

00:04:23.505 --> 00:04:26.905
We’ll also get a list of the drug buyers.

00:04:28.925 --> 00:04:31.825
That means we can't fail this.

00:04:32.595 --> 00:04:35.105
We can't let even one person escape.

00:04:36.195 --> 00:04:37.465
- Captain Witthaya.
- Yes, sir.

00:04:38.095 --> 00:04:40.225
Keep an eye on
any suspicious customers.

00:04:41.195 --> 00:04:42.745
If they show up,
notify the team immediately.

00:04:43.005 --> 00:04:43.665
Yes, sir.

00:04:49.235 --> 00:04:50.265
The regular is here.

00:04:51.365 --> 00:04:52.465
As for the other units.

00:04:53.115 --> 00:04:54.825
Spread out and take your positions.

00:04:55.005 --> 00:04:56.065
Stand by for the arrest.

00:04:56.685 --> 00:04:59.065
- Wait for my signal only.
- Copy that.

00:04:59.955 --> 00:05:00.865
Hey, hey.

00:05:01.445 --> 00:05:01.945
Hey.

00:05:02.475 --> 00:05:03.185
Leave it.

00:05:12.795 --> 00:05:13.865
- Go.
- Sorry.

00:05:22.775 --> 00:05:24.665
The lotus has bloomed.
Prepare to harvest.

00:05:38.885 --> 00:05:42.025
Is the 1,000-lotus offering set done?

00:05:42.435 --> 00:05:43.825
Almost done. Oh.

00:05:44.405 --> 00:05:45.825
- Just finished.
- Go.

00:05:48.085 --> 00:05:48.945
Hey, How is going?

00:05:49.245 --> 00:05:50.825
- All set?
- All set.

00:05:53.795 --> 00:05:55.545
Target has entered Zone Bravo 3.

00:05:56.045 --> 00:05:56.945
All units, stand by.

00:06:06.955 --> 00:06:07.465
Here.

00:06:07.765 --> 00:06:09.065
- Is that everything?
- Check it. All set.

00:06:09.225 --> 00:06:09.905
All done.

00:06:16.965 --> 00:06:17.665
Hey, Stop.

00:06:19.365 --> 00:06:20.025
Sit!

00:06:20.795 --> 00:06:22.065
The police have you surrounded!

00:06:24.395 --> 00:06:26.025
Stop. Don't move.

00:06:26.535 --> 00:06:27.345
Sit.

00:06:30.875 --> 00:06:32.225
- Hey!
- Don't move.

00:06:32.645 --> 00:06:33.505
Sit.

00:06:34.795 --> 00:06:35.745
On your knees!

00:06:36.365 --> 00:06:37.345
Don't move.

00:06:37.565 --> 00:06:38.705
The police have you surrounded!

00:06:39.555 --> 00:06:40.625
I told you to sit down!

00:07:06.355 --> 00:07:07.065
Stop!

00:07:14.605 --> 00:07:15.265
Hey, follow.

00:07:19.005 --> 00:07:19.545
Go.

00:07:19.805 --> 00:07:20.385
Go!

00:07:24.635 --> 00:07:25.225
Hey.

00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:44.545
Captain.

00:07:50.245 --> 00:07:50.985
Stay still.

00:07:59.155 --> 00:07:59.865
Stop.

00:08:03.005 --> 00:08:03.985
I said stop!

00:08:09.395 --> 00:08:10.665
Ouch! Ouch!

00:08:10.845 --> 00:08:12.265
- Don't move
- Pick him up.

00:08:12.645 --> 00:08:13.185
Pick him up.

00:08:13.365 --> 00:08:13.905
Stop.

00:08:14.325 --> 00:08:14.905
Don't.

00:08:15.565 --> 00:08:16.345
Don't resist!

00:08:18.805 --> 00:08:19.665
Thank you so much.

00:08:22.885 --> 00:08:24.585
Oh, Mr. Phakphum. Hello, sir.

00:08:25.725 --> 00:08:26.625
Hold still.

00:08:31.785 --> 00:08:33.185
(Sending my support to Captain Than, Love.)

00:08:33.405 --> 00:08:36.745
Wait, is a fan actually
sending a gift to Captain Tarn?

00:08:37.845 --> 00:08:40.225
Do you know this Captain Tarn?

00:08:40.675 --> 00:08:42.265
Of course!
This is Mali we're talking about.

00:08:42.575 --> 00:08:46.305
Captain Tarn is a superstar!
How can you not know her.

00:08:46.835 --> 00:08:48.305
Let me show you a picture right now.

00:08:48.965 --> 00:08:49.825
Here.

00:08:53.405 --> 00:08:55.025
I love it so much!

00:08:55.645 --> 00:08:59.545
The only police officers
I know are my father and Brother X.

00:09:01.565 --> 00:09:04.665
What's her full name?
I might ask my dad about her.

00:09:04.845 --> 00:09:08.385
Her name is Police Captain Thara Klahan.

00:09:08.655 --> 00:09:12.305
I think she’s with the Special Crimes
Suppression Division.

00:10:43.155 --> 00:10:44.025
I can't take it anymore.

00:10:45.325 --> 00:10:46.465
Ouch! I give up.

00:10:49.725 --> 00:10:51.785
Ouch! I give up.

00:10:55.765 --> 00:10:56.345
Sit down.

00:11:06.405 --> 00:11:07.065
Lieutenant.

00:11:10.245 --> 00:11:14.585
All evidence is 90% pure
methamphetamine.

00:11:14.995 --> 00:11:16.465
It looks like it’s intended for export.

00:11:25.765 --> 00:11:26.425
Go.

00:11:28.185 --> 00:11:29.785
I must apologize, sir.

00:11:30.285 --> 00:11:31.865
The arrest didn't go as planned

00:11:32.045 --> 00:11:34.745
because the residential area
was hard to control.

00:11:34.965 --> 00:11:35.905
It's okay.

00:11:36.165 --> 00:11:39.545
As long as no officers
or civilians were hurt.

00:11:42.085 --> 00:11:43.025
Ah, sir.

00:11:43.525 --> 00:11:46.825
Captain Thara is in charge of
the investigation team for this case.

00:11:59.805 --> 00:12:00.545
Good job.

00:12:06.515 --> 00:12:08.265
There’s a bit of a situation here.

00:12:08.925 --> 00:12:09.705
But don't worry.

00:12:10.485 --> 00:12:11.505
Everything is cleared up now.

00:12:11.725 --> 00:12:14.265
Please hurry!
It's getting really crowded here.

00:12:14.645 --> 00:12:16.585
Understood.
I'll inform him right away.

00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:18.105
This place looks really nice!

00:12:19.245 --> 00:12:20.345
Want to go take some photos?

00:12:20.765 --> 00:12:24.185
Ms. Vicky. Minister Burin’s assistant
delivered this for you.

00:12:31.565 --> 00:12:32.225
Sir.

00:12:34.395 --> 00:12:35.985
- I’ll leave this in your hands.
- Yes, sir.

00:12:43.195 --> 00:12:45.465
My apologies.
We couldn't catch them this time.

00:12:46.195 --> 00:12:49.225
They had an accomplice waiting in a van,
and he drove them away.

00:12:49.795 --> 00:12:52.625
I’ve sent the plates number
to the team to check.

00:12:53.785 --> 00:12:55.505
I'm just glad you're okay.

00:12:55.885 --> 00:13:00.465
I’d like to request CCTV footage
within a 500-meter radius, last six hours.

00:13:01.125 --> 00:13:02.545
- Ok?
- Yes, sir.

00:13:07.085 --> 00:13:07.745
Sir.

00:13:08.675 --> 00:13:12.785
The suspect claims excessive force.

00:13:13.205 --> 00:13:16.865
I may need you as a witness for this arrest.

00:13:17.965 --> 00:13:18.745
Sure.

00:13:20.085 --> 00:13:21.025
Thank you, sir.

00:13:56.765 --> 00:13:59.225
Dad, where have you been?

00:14:00.355 --> 00:14:02.585
It’s my grand opening today,
where were you?

00:14:02.715 --> 00:14:06.745
Well... I got tied up with work.
I'm really sorry.

00:14:08.035 --> 00:14:09.225
you said you’d come.

00:14:17.075 --> 00:14:18.545
Are you still mad at me?

00:14:26.395 --> 00:14:28.065
Hmm, it's beautiful.

00:14:28.775 --> 00:14:29.945
Did you pick this out yourself?

00:14:30.365 --> 00:14:31.105
Yeah.

00:14:32.035 --> 00:14:34.745
After all, it’s a big day
for my beautiful girl.

00:14:35.955 --> 00:14:39.545
Your beautiful girl is still never as
important as your work, anyway.

00:14:39.735 --> 00:14:42.265
Whoa, who told you that?

00:14:43.085 --> 00:14:44.625
One day, you'll understand that

00:14:45.005 --> 00:14:48.025
you are the most
important person in my life.

00:14:51.965 --> 00:14:53.425
I know.

00:14:53.645 --> 00:14:55.065
Just kidding.

00:14:55.795 --> 00:14:57.825
You're my super dad.

00:15:02.795 --> 00:15:04.265
Oh, dad.

00:15:04.845 --> 00:15:07.225
Um, about Minister Burin.

00:15:07.605 --> 00:15:09.065
Is he a friend of yours, Dad?

00:15:09.805 --> 00:15:11.065
Um, what is he doing?

00:15:21.125 --> 00:15:23.905
I only see him around at event.
We aren't that close.

00:15:24.325 --> 00:15:25.225
Hmm.

00:15:26.025 --> 00:15:27.705
That bouquet is massive!

00:15:35.265 --> 00:15:36.985
The suspect confessed that

00:15:37.335 --> 00:15:39.785
he was hired to smuggle drugs
from the Northern and store them here.

00:15:40.045 --> 00:15:42.465
Then, various buyers would reach out to deal.

00:15:43.165 --> 00:15:45.265
The warehouse owner denied

00:15:45.685 --> 00:15:46.825
any involvement.

00:15:47.765 --> 00:15:48.785
All counted, Tarn?

00:15:49.555 --> 00:15:50.305
Yes.

00:15:54.125 --> 00:15:55.625
15 bags of meth pills.

00:15:55.885 --> 00:15:58.865
That’s a total of 3,257,000 tablets.

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:01.585
10 bags of Ice, weighing 300kg in total,

00:16:01.705 --> 00:16:05.185
7kg of Happy Water, and 500 E-pills.

00:16:10.475 --> 00:16:11.785
Right in the middle of the city.

00:16:12.485 --> 00:16:14.785
and they still dare to deal
such a massive haul!

00:16:15.885 --> 00:16:17.785
It’s obvious how they look at us.

00:16:18.915 --> 00:16:21.025
Sarge, send the report over
to Deputy Phakphum, too.

00:16:26.925 --> 00:16:29.865
Call me if something’s not right.

00:16:32.205 --> 00:16:33.505
Thank you, Inspector.

00:16:34.775 --> 00:16:36.625
Your daughter seems very bright.

00:16:37.925 --> 00:16:38.865
What is your name?

00:16:39.205 --> 00:16:40.465
My name is Looknam.

00:16:44.445 --> 00:16:45.665
She's cute.

00:16:47.815 --> 00:16:49.665
It’s my daughter’s birthday this Saturday.

00:16:49.955 --> 00:16:51.105
We’re having a small celebration.

00:16:52.255 --> 00:16:55.025
Bring Looknam along,
the kids can be friends.

00:16:58.525 --> 00:17:02.225
Oh, are you sure?
I wouldn’t want to impose.

00:17:03.525 --> 00:17:04.865
Not at all.

00:17:06.115 --> 00:17:07.785
Bring Looknam’s mother along too,

00:17:08.035 --> 00:17:10.665
so she can meet my wife, Yaowapha.

00:17:11.685 --> 00:17:13.785
Your family has been through
a lot of stress lately.

00:17:14.085 --> 00:17:15.745
Let your wife and daughter come out
and have some fun.

00:17:17.715 --> 00:17:18.825
Come join us, Looknam.

00:17:19.605 --> 00:17:21.425
You don't need to bring any gifts, dear.

00:17:21.765 --> 00:17:23.545
Just coming to play
with my daughter is enough.

00:17:24.365 --> 00:17:25.025
Yes.

00:17:26.805 --> 00:17:29.545
Dad, please? I really want to go.

00:17:29.765 --> 00:17:34.985
Please, Please, please?

00:17:35.645 --> 00:17:37.745
Captain Thara,
are the documents ready?

00:17:38.195 --> 00:17:38.825
Tarn.

00:17:40.125 --> 00:17:40.785
Tarn.

00:17:42.245 --> 00:17:42.985
Yes?

00:17:44.085 --> 00:17:46.065
The press conference is in two hours.

00:17:46.805 --> 00:17:47.945
Is the paperwork ready?

00:17:48.805 --> 00:17:49.665
Ready, sir.

00:17:50.395 --> 00:17:51.105
Ok.

00:17:51.355 --> 00:17:52.745
Back to work.

00:17:53.085 --> 00:17:55.505
- If you're clear, get ready downstairs.
- Yes.

00:18:12.075 --> 00:18:14.185
Let's call Noey this evening and celebrate.

00:18:16.775 --> 00:18:17.585
Hey, Tarn.

00:18:18.405 --> 00:18:19.545
What are you thinking?

00:18:20.005 --> 00:18:21.105
You’ve been off since earlier.

00:18:21.905 --> 00:18:23.385
I'm just thinking about work today.

00:18:24.125 --> 00:18:26.825
Yeah, I thought it was going to drag on today.

00:18:27.085 --> 00:18:29.465
Luckily, we had Deputy Phakphum
there to help.

00:18:30.965 --> 00:18:32.945
It’s no surprise he reached that level.

00:18:34.435 --> 00:18:35.985
Who knows how many people
he had to step on to get there.

00:18:37.115 --> 00:18:39.225
You're talking like
you've known him before.

00:18:40.725 --> 00:18:41.585
Tarn.

00:18:42.005 --> 00:18:43.025
Wow.

00:18:43.805 --> 00:18:45.065
There are so many gifts here!

00:18:48.725 --> 00:18:49.665
Hey.

00:18:50.595 --> 00:18:52.385
Princess Pastry.

00:18:52.675 --> 00:18:54.145
Wow, this box looks so high-end!

00:18:54.395 --> 00:18:55.385
This must be really expensive.

00:18:56.325 --> 00:18:56.905
Hey!

00:18:58.285 --> 00:18:59.025
What?

00:19:01.125 --> 00:19:02.145
Shoot!

00:19:02.385 --> 00:19:04.425
My girlfriend just invited me
to this cake shop's opening.

00:19:05.715 --> 00:19:06.425
So...

00:19:06.965 --> 00:19:07.905
I've gotta go.

00:19:10.605 --> 00:19:11.225
Oh!

00:19:12.085 --> 00:19:13.225
What's up with him?

00:19:17.155 --> 00:19:18.625
Oh, wow.

00:19:22.205 --> 00:19:23.145
Tarn, my dear sister!

00:19:23.795 --> 00:19:25.745
Have you ever heard that old saying?

00:19:27.135 --> 00:19:30.385
- We cannot live in this world alone.
- Umm.

00:19:30.565 --> 00:19:32.705
Whatever we have, it's better to share.

00:19:33.205 --> 00:19:33.865
Umm.

00:19:34.245 --> 00:19:35.745
Otherwise, it’ll go to waste.

00:19:35.955 --> 00:19:37.185
- Umm.
- This pastry is quite expensive.

00:19:38.835 --> 00:19:39.825
It'll go bad.

00:19:40.405 --> 00:19:41.225
Thanks a lot.

00:19:46.285 --> 00:19:47.505
Oh, P'Ken.

00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:15.025
(Los Angeles, America)

00:20:18.875 --> 00:20:19.825
Hello, honey.

00:20:20.755 --> 00:20:21.825
Still in bed, Mom?

00:20:23.085 --> 00:20:25.385
Yeah, I closed the shop late last night.

00:20:27.845 --> 00:20:28.945
I'll let you sleep then.

00:20:29.915 --> 00:20:31.705
It’s okay, I can talk.

00:20:34.525 --> 00:20:35.305
Mom.

00:20:36.355 --> 00:20:37.505
I met him today.

00:20:39.805 --> 00:20:40.545
Who?

00:20:42.905 --> 00:20:44.105
Inspector Phakphum.

00:20:45.405 --> 00:20:47.545
But he's the Deputy
Commissioner General now.

00:20:49.925 --> 00:20:50.545
But...

00:20:51.995 --> 00:20:53.305
How did you two meet?

00:20:56.325 --> 00:20:57.425
It was just a coincidence.

00:20:57.765 --> 00:20:59.785
I’ve been working for so long
and never even got close to him.

00:21:00.485 --> 00:21:02.985
I was in the middle of a bust,
and there he was.

00:21:03.925 --> 00:21:06.305
But your work isn't related to him
in any way, right?

00:21:08.325 --> 00:21:08.985
No.

00:21:12.035 --> 00:21:13.785
Then stay far away from him, okay?

00:21:15.165 --> 00:21:16.305
Don't you want to know?

00:21:17.165 --> 00:21:19.305
What really happened 19 years ago?

00:21:21.925 --> 00:21:22.985
It's in the past.

00:21:24.395 --> 00:21:25.665
Don't go digging it up.

00:21:26.165 --> 00:21:28.665
We both have a good life now.

00:21:32.075 --> 00:21:32.785
Tarn.

00:21:34.955 --> 00:21:36.145
I'm begging you.

00:21:37.315 --> 00:21:38.825
Just leave each other alone.

00:22:05.805 --> 00:22:07.785
So, are we just going to
let Dad die for nothing?

00:22:12.125 --> 00:22:13.185
Dad.

00:22:13.835 --> 00:22:14.945
Daddy.

00:22:15.125 --> 00:22:16.385
Are you in the backyard?

00:22:16.555 --> 00:22:19.385
Keep it down, Nam.
Think about the neighbors.

00:22:39.685 --> 00:22:40.345
Thana...

00:22:40.765 --> 00:22:41.665
Thana...

00:22:42.205 --> 00:22:42.945
Thana...

00:22:45.165 --> 00:22:46.225
Help!

00:22:46.605 --> 00:22:48.025
Help! Help!

00:22:48.245 --> 00:22:49.385
Help! Help!

00:22:49.685 --> 00:22:50.585
Thana...

00:22:51.245 --> 00:22:52.985
Why would you do this?

00:22:53.365 --> 00:22:54.145
Thana...

00:22:54.605 --> 00:22:56.145
Help!

00:22:56.565 --> 00:22:58.785
Help! Help!

00:22:59.245 --> 00:22:59.945
Thana...

00:23:02.525 --> 00:23:03.545
Thana...

00:23:11.115 --> 00:23:11.865
Dad.

00:24:20.945 --> 00:24:23.585
Is this for use or for sale?

00:24:26.285 --> 00:24:27.665
- Hey, answer me!
- Ow.

00:24:29.405 --> 00:24:30.305
Ow.

00:24:30.835 --> 00:24:34.985
I came to visit,
not to face an interrogation.

00:24:38.235 --> 00:24:39.385
Fine, whatever.

00:24:41.475 --> 00:24:42.585
And then what?

00:24:44.645 --> 00:24:47.705
I just realized, there's still Fundee.

00:24:48.045 --> 00:24:49.705
Someone once told me.

00:24:49.925 --> 00:24:53.945
if I hold Fundee
and count down from 100 to 1.

00:24:54.205 --> 00:24:55.745
I'll have sweet dreams.

00:24:56.365 --> 00:24:59.105
And what time did you
suddenly remember this?

00:24:59.885 --> 00:25:01.185
Past 3 AM.

00:25:01.565 --> 00:25:03.465
Wait, 3 AM?

00:25:04.075 --> 00:25:08.145
Ugh, maybe try remembering it
a bit sooner next time.

00:25:13.445 --> 00:25:14.945
Hmm, but...

00:25:15.675 --> 00:25:17.745
You haven't thought
about your dad in a long time?

00:25:18.885 --> 00:25:19.545
Right.

00:25:21.445 --> 00:25:23.545
Maybe Dad is trying to tell me something.

00:25:23.765 --> 00:25:25.265
Yeah, maybe. It’s possible.

00:25:36.515 --> 00:25:37.705
Anyway, I'm heading to work now.

00:25:40.085 --> 00:25:40.985
Hey, Tarn.

00:25:41.865 --> 00:25:43.785
Thanks for dropping off
that cake last night.

00:25:44.365 --> 00:25:45.145
It was so good...

00:25:46.245 --> 00:25:47.545
It felt like heaven in my mouth.

00:25:50.365 --> 00:25:51.305
Of course it's good.

00:25:51.815 --> 00:25:54.185
It cost 500 baht a slice!
It'd be crazy if it wasn't.

00:25:57.515 --> 00:26:00.305
Lucky Dr. Noey, having
such a famous friend.

00:26:03.155 --> 00:26:05.265
Hey, focus on your work, okay?

00:26:06.645 --> 00:26:07.305
See you.

00:26:08.045 --> 00:26:09.225
Yeah.

00:26:11.445 --> 00:26:12.625
Bye.

00:26:47.645 --> 00:26:50.745
Once the date is set,
I'll have X inform you, Doctor.

00:26:51.325 --> 00:26:53.265
Yes, sir. The sooner, the better.

00:26:56.125 --> 00:26:57.865
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:26:58.725 --> 00:26:59.985
Excuse me, sir.

00:27:00.725 --> 00:27:01.425
Yes.

00:27:05.965 --> 00:27:06.785
How's it going?

00:27:08.005 --> 00:27:09.585
I've checked the CCTV footage.

00:27:09.965 --> 00:27:11.785
They’ve been tailing us since the airport.

00:27:12.155 --> 00:27:15.065
As for the license plate, it’s a fake.

00:27:16.005 --> 00:27:16.785
Sir.

00:27:18.045 --> 00:27:20.545
Someone is definitely after you, sir.

00:27:21.405 --> 00:27:22.945
The bombing last month.

00:27:23.485 --> 00:27:25.065
You were the real target.

00:27:26.555 --> 00:27:28.385
It wasn't just a staged
incident to create a situation.

00:27:36.475 --> 00:27:37.865
- Oh, Inspector!
- Lieutenant.

00:27:39.925 --> 00:27:41.545
Oh, right. Team B is out
on a drug bust today?

00:27:41.685 --> 00:27:42.145
Yes.

00:27:42.285 --> 00:27:43.705
Make sure security is tightened, everyone.

00:27:44.505 --> 00:27:46.065
- Copy that.
- Thank you.

00:27:49.445 --> 00:27:50.105
Whoa,

00:27:50.805 --> 00:27:51.865
why are you putting on makeup?

00:27:52.405 --> 00:27:54.225
Team B’s handling the drug bust today.

00:27:56.165 --> 00:27:57.505
I didn't do anything.

00:27:57.865 --> 00:27:59.345
I just woke up like this.

00:27:59.695 --> 00:28:02.505
Hardly slept last night. Up 'til dawn.

00:28:05.535 --> 00:28:06.705
Whoa, what's this?

00:28:07.805 --> 00:28:08.785
Couldn't sleep either, huh?

00:28:10.445 --> 00:28:11.625
No, bro.

00:28:12.735 --> 00:28:16.225
His hi-so girlfriend dumped him.
she blocked him.

00:28:19.205 --> 00:28:20.545
- Hey.
- Yes, sir.

00:28:23.555 --> 00:28:25.145
Still not used to it, Pete?

00:28:25.885 --> 00:28:27.305
Since you joined my unit.

00:28:28.045 --> 00:28:30.425
Getting dumped has basically
become your daily routine.

00:28:31.285 --> 00:28:33.305
should I just switch departments?

00:28:35.765 --> 00:28:37.685
Even Tarn is single.

00:28:37.685 --> 00:28:39.985
This unit is a total romance killer.
Even Tarn is single.

00:28:42.045 --> 00:28:43.225
So drama.

00:28:43.555 --> 00:28:45.345
That has nothing to do with it.

00:28:45.645 --> 00:28:47.105
I have a wife, everything's normal with me.

00:28:47.445 --> 00:28:50.385
Everyone else in the team
has a girlfriend too.

00:28:51.555 --> 00:28:53.185
Huh? And look at Tarn.

00:28:53.885 --> 00:28:56.665
She's single,
and she's doing just fine, see?

00:28:57.765 --> 00:28:59.785
She even goes to
eat Moo-krata all by herself.

00:29:00.315 --> 00:29:02.425
She watches movies alone, too.

00:29:03.005 --> 00:29:04.905
And when she had appendicitis,

00:29:05.485 --> 00:29:07.665
she still rode her bike
to the hospital all on her own.

00:29:08.085 --> 00:29:09.385
She’s this pathetic,

00:29:09.725 --> 00:29:11.665
yet she doesn’t seem to care at all.
Right, Tarn?

00:29:13.525 --> 00:29:14.865
Now you've got me thinking, bro.

00:29:16.445 --> 00:29:18.105
Geez, it a compliment.

00:29:18.595 --> 00:29:18.985
Hmph.

00:29:19.165 --> 00:29:21.385
Come on, just enjoy life.
Don't overthink it.

00:29:22.645 --> 00:29:23.465
Sigh.

00:29:24.485 --> 00:29:25.225
Oh, right.

00:29:26.115 --> 00:29:28.945
Next time we have to go
undercover as junkies.

00:29:29.715 --> 00:29:30.745
Use this look as the reference, okay?

00:29:31.015 --> 00:29:31.825
A junkie look.

00:29:32.405 --> 00:29:33.505
I buy it.

00:29:51.845 --> 00:29:54.265
Oh, Vicky You're still here?

00:29:54.645 --> 00:29:56.105
Just going to check the stock for a bit.

00:29:56.365 --> 00:29:59.025
Okay, I'm heading out then.

00:29:59.325 --> 00:30:00.225
Get home safe.

00:30:00.685 --> 00:30:01.185
Ok.

00:30:15.595 --> 00:30:17.665
Tarn, let’s go somewhere else.

00:30:18.365 --> 00:30:19.705
Wound is still fresh.

00:30:20.675 --> 00:30:22.545
But Noey loves this place.

00:30:22.965 --> 00:30:25.865
She calls just to tell me how great it is.

00:30:26.445 --> 00:30:27.585
You tried it, right?

00:30:28.325 --> 00:30:31.225
It was freaking delicious!
Like, seriously,

00:30:31.485 --> 00:30:32.985
it deserves a Michelin star.

00:30:34.155 --> 00:30:35.945
You should really become a food reviewer.

00:30:36.365 --> 00:30:40.185
Believe me, I've never had
a cake this good in my entire life.

00:30:40.525 --> 00:30:41.985
Yeah, I get it.

00:30:42.425 --> 00:30:43.905
Wanna go offer food to the monks
tomorrow morning?

00:30:45.125 --> 00:30:46.265
Huh?

00:30:46.805 --> 00:30:48.505
It’s my birthday.

00:30:49.535 --> 00:30:50.785
Please? Go with me.

00:30:51.725 --> 00:30:54.105
Since my mom passed away,

00:30:54.405 --> 00:30:56.185
I haven’t really celebrated
my birthday at all.

00:30:56.385 --> 00:31:00.625
And a decent birthday cake?
I haven't even had a taste of one.

00:31:01.245 --> 00:31:01.905
Hmm.

00:31:04.325 --> 00:31:07.505
Geez, I get it. Fine, let's do it.

00:31:08.325 --> 00:31:09.465
I feel like making some merit too.

00:31:09.765 --> 00:31:11.625
That's all.

00:31:12.565 --> 00:31:13.225
Yeah.

00:31:14.005 --> 00:31:14.745
See you.

00:31:15.465 --> 00:31:17.985
That's why I wanted to surprise her
with a cake from this shop.

00:31:18.645 --> 00:31:20.425
She dropped that many hints
and you still call it a surprise?

00:31:20.765 --> 00:31:21.545
Oh.

00:31:22.755 --> 00:31:26.105
Do you really think
if the gang didn't keep reminding her,

00:31:26.405 --> 00:31:27.625
she wouldn't forget?

00:31:29.595 --> 00:31:32.105
Just like how you forgot to show up
at this shop's opening with your girlfriend.

00:31:34.045 --> 00:31:35.945
Just start fighting already.
I’m begging you.

00:31:36.085 --> 00:31:36.905
Hey.

00:31:37.605 --> 00:31:38.385
You jerk!

00:31:39.325 --> 00:31:39.945
Oops.

00:31:43.325 --> 00:31:44.145
Hello, Mom?

00:31:46.035 --> 00:31:48.345
Nong Noo, can you go buy
some fish sauce for me?

00:31:48.725 --> 00:31:51.105
Oh, sure. I'll go get it for you.

00:31:51.915 --> 00:31:52.825
Talk to you later.

00:31:55.245 --> 00:31:57.185
Okay, I'm on it.

00:31:57.715 --> 00:31:59.505
You're fully grown
and you still call yourself Noo?

00:31:59.955 --> 00:32:01.345
I'm in Kitty mode.

00:32:01.835 --> 00:32:03.545
Alright, I’m gonna go grab
that fish sauce for my mom first.

00:32:03.725 --> 00:32:06.145
Once you're done with the cake,
just meet me back here.

00:32:06.365 --> 00:32:07.545
- Got it.
- I'm off.

00:32:07.725 --> 00:32:08.465
See you.

00:32:44.605 --> 00:32:46.065
Um, excuse me.

00:32:47.165 --> 00:32:49.225
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

00:32:51.285 --> 00:32:53.865
I'm looking for
a birthday cake for a friend.

00:32:54.615 --> 00:32:56.105
Do you have any recommendations?

00:32:57.845 --> 00:32:58.905
I'm sorry.

00:32:59.325 --> 00:33:00.625
We're already closed.

00:33:01.255 --> 00:33:04.025
The staff must have
forgotten to lock the door.

00:33:04.485 --> 00:33:08.185
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't notice the sign.

00:33:09.045 --> 00:33:10.225
I’m so sorry.

00:33:10.475 --> 00:33:11.745
It's not that we don't want to sell,

00:33:11.965 --> 00:33:14.305
but we’re completely out of stock.

00:33:14.525 --> 00:33:16.425
We bake everything fresh daily.

00:33:19.155 --> 00:33:20.265
How about this?

00:33:20.725 --> 00:33:22.025
Come back tomorrow.

00:33:22.245 --> 00:33:25.505
Or you can call to order,
and we’ll deliver it for free.

00:33:25.965 --> 00:33:28.065
Oh, sure. Let’s do that.

00:33:29.405 --> 00:33:30.225
Wait!

00:33:33.045 --> 00:33:34.265
Could you.

00:33:35.245 --> 00:33:37.025
Please leave your name
and phone number?

00:33:37.885 --> 00:33:40.785
So I can let the staff know.

00:33:41.165 --> 00:33:45.105
On top of the free delivery
I'll give you an extra 20% discount

00:33:46.805 --> 00:33:47.585
Yes.

00:33:54.765 --> 00:33:55.705
Hey, watch out!

00:34:19.805 --> 00:34:20.425
Hey!

00:34:29.045 --> 00:34:30.105
Reporting a two-zero.

00:34:53.165 --> 00:34:54.105
Are you okay?

00:34:56.285 --> 00:34:57.145
I'm fine.

00:34:58.045 --> 00:34:59.025
Don't be scared.

00:35:00.325 --> 00:35:01.305
Don't be scared.

00:35:05.275 --> 00:35:06.545
You’re not hurt anywhere, right?

00:35:44.165 --> 00:35:45.745
- Please take care of this.
- Copy that.

00:35:47.405 --> 00:35:48.185
Vicky.

00:35:48.845 --> 00:35:49.825
How are you?

00:35:53.835 --> 00:35:55.065
I'm fine.

00:35:56.235 --> 00:35:57.305
Just a bit scared.

00:35:57.655 --> 00:36:00.985
Um, what about the others?
Is everyone else okay?

00:36:02.155 --> 00:36:04.065
Everyone else has
already gone home, Dad.

00:36:04.565 --> 00:36:08.185
It's just me and
the customer who helped out.

00:36:09.595 --> 00:36:10.745
Where is she now?

00:36:12.565 --> 00:36:15.505
She gave a statement
and then asked to leave.

00:36:16.165 --> 00:36:17.985
She said she's currently on duty.

00:36:18.085 --> 00:36:19.785
If her boss finds out,
she'll be in big trouble.

00:36:22.045 --> 00:36:23.065
X, take care of this for me.

00:36:23.835 --> 00:36:24.665
Yes, sir.

00:36:33.595 --> 00:36:34.345
Hello.

00:36:39.535 --> 00:36:42.385
Captain, do you happen to know
who rescued Ms. Vicky?

00:36:42.685 --> 00:36:43.705
Captain Tarn, sir.

00:36:44.725 --> 00:36:46.105
- Captain Tarn?
- Yes.

00:36:49.125 --> 00:36:52.025
And what exactly happened at the scene?

00:36:58.005 --> 00:36:59.305
He couldn't get to me.

00:36:59.945 --> 00:37:01.745
So he targeted Vicky instead.

00:37:02.715 --> 00:37:04.665
Are you certain it was him, sir?

00:37:06.285 --> 00:37:08.185
I'm as sure as you are.

00:37:09.815 --> 00:37:12.305
He's taking out everyone
who knows his secret.

00:37:13.125 --> 00:37:14.505
I’m not worried about myself.

00:37:15.715 --> 00:37:16.905
I’m only worried about my daughter.

00:37:17.985 --> 00:37:20.425
Then you should keep Vicky close
where you can keep an eye on her, sir.

00:37:21.635 --> 00:37:22.745
That way, you won't have to worry.

00:37:32.915 --> 00:37:35.505
I thought you wouldn't
be able to wake up in time.

00:37:36.405 --> 00:37:37.425
How could I not?

00:37:37.775 --> 00:37:39.265
I gave you my word.

00:37:40.865 --> 00:37:42.985
Happy Birthday, Noey, my bestie!

00:37:43.605 --> 00:37:45.585
May you get promoted real fast.

00:37:46.315 --> 00:37:47.865
And I hope you find your soulmate soon.

00:37:49.385 --> 00:37:51.145
I’d rather stay single until the day I die.

00:37:51.485 --> 00:37:53.345
Better to let the guys regret losing me.

00:37:53.565 --> 00:37:54.865
And who exactly is going
to regret that? Huh?

00:37:55.005 --> 00:37:55.865
Hey.

00:37:59.565 --> 00:38:03.025
Tarn! Why did you light an
incense to summon Pete here?

00:38:03.325 --> 00:38:04.505
I’m not dead yet!

00:38:05.725 --> 00:38:06.585
Geez,

00:38:07.385 --> 00:38:10.585
he’s been having a run of bad luck lately,
broken heart and all.

00:38:11.405 --> 00:38:12.585
What?

00:38:13.705 --> 00:38:16.465
So I bring him to offer food to the monks,
to gain some merit points for him.

00:38:19.155 --> 00:38:19.985
Yeah,

00:38:20.605 --> 00:38:23.265
and I’m planning to make
some merit for my dad, too.

00:38:26.005 --> 00:38:28.665
Hey, hurry up!
Let's go before we're too late.

00:38:30.885 --> 00:38:33.265
One set of offerings for the monks, please.

00:38:33.405 --> 00:38:34.185
Okay.

00:38:35.395 --> 00:38:37.625
Got any more?

00:38:37.965 --> 00:38:39.185
That was the last one.

00:38:43.485 --> 00:38:44.385
Let me join in.

00:38:45.045 --> 00:38:46.025
No way.

00:38:46.325 --> 00:38:48.025
This is for my birthday.

00:38:49.945 --> 00:38:51.865
Tarn, let me share yours.

00:38:52.875 --> 00:38:55.625
What? No, I'm doing this for my dad.

00:38:57.835 --> 00:38:59.345
Why don't you two just share it then?

00:39:00.325 --> 00:39:02.825
You know what they say
making merit together from the same bowl.

00:39:03.745 --> 00:39:05.585
Means you’ll be soulmates
in the next life.

00:39:05.825 --> 00:39:08.265
Whoa, Tarn!
How could you even say that?

00:39:09.005 --> 00:39:10.225
Please, Venerable Sir.

00:39:41.925 --> 00:39:46.385
(Praying)

00:40:02.725 --> 00:40:03.705
Hey, watch out!

00:40:10.685 --> 00:40:11.865
Someone is coming to help.

00:40:12.565 --> 00:40:13.505
Just stay calm.

00:40:27.005 --> 00:40:28.705
- Mali.
- Yes?

00:40:30.085 --> 00:40:32.945
Has Captain Tarn called to order a cake yet?

00:40:33.565 --> 00:40:34.585
Not yet.

00:40:35.165 --> 00:40:35.865
Oh.

00:40:36.885 --> 00:40:39.145
Or maybe she'll just come
and buy it at the shop.

00:40:39.795 --> 00:40:44.705
Only that couple
keeps coming back every hour.

00:40:57.325 --> 00:40:59.065
Princess Pastry, How can I help you?

00:41:00.925 --> 00:41:01.905
Sure.

00:41:03.445 --> 00:41:05.145
Would you like
a birthday message written on it?

00:41:06.485 --> 00:41:07.465
What is your name?

00:41:08.045 --> 00:41:09.265
Doctor Noey.

00:41:09.675 --> 00:41:12.385
Please leave your name
and contact number.

00:41:12.885 --> 00:41:18.425
Dad, there are two officers
circling my shop every hour.

00:41:18.765 --> 00:41:19.785
What is going on?

00:41:22.405 --> 00:41:24.105
Seriously, isn't this too much?

00:41:24.205 --> 00:41:25.905
You're scaring all my customers away.

00:41:27.075 --> 00:41:29.385
I've never had a problem
with anyone, I swear.

00:41:29.645 --> 00:41:30.865
When I opened this shop,

00:41:31.035 --> 00:41:33.865
I made sure there were
no competitors nearby.

00:41:35.345 --> 00:41:37.025
They must have targeted
the wrong person.

00:41:43.685 --> 00:41:45.065
It's not exactly the wrong person,
sweetheart.

00:41:46.085 --> 00:41:47.345
What do you mean by that?

00:41:48.045 --> 00:41:49.465
Their real target is me.

00:41:50.635 --> 00:41:53.025
They know you’re the apple of my eye,

00:41:53.485 --> 00:41:54.945
so they’re coming after you to get to me.

00:41:56.485 --> 00:41:57.585
Who are they?

00:41:59.065 --> 00:42:01.785
My line of work involves
stepping on a lot of people's toes.

00:42:04.165 --> 00:42:05.305
But for now,

00:42:06.205 --> 00:42:08.465
until I can bring them to justice.

00:42:09.875 --> 00:42:11.305
I want to make sure.

00:42:12.605 --> 00:42:14.425
You’re in a safe place.

00:42:15.915 --> 00:42:17.105
Dad, do you mean.

00:42:17.525 --> 00:42:19.225
You’re sending me abroad?

00:42:21.595 --> 00:42:22.825
No way.

00:42:24.005 --> 00:42:26.825
I don't want to go overseas.
I'll get homesick.

00:42:28.275 --> 00:42:29.345
It’s not like that.

00:42:29.995 --> 00:42:32.105
I just want someone to protect
and look after you.

00:42:33.925 --> 00:42:34.825
Look after me?

00:42:35.355 --> 00:42:37.705
Are you trying to set me up for a marriage?

00:42:37.925 --> 00:42:41.665
No, Dad. I'm only 23.
I have a bakery to run.

00:42:41.805 --> 00:42:44.665
- So many things I want to do.
- Calm down, sweetheart. Listen to me first.

00:42:46.365 --> 00:42:48.585
I want you to
come and work close to me.

00:42:49.285 --> 00:42:50.425
Close to you?

00:42:52.755 --> 00:42:53.905
As a police officer?

00:42:56.565 --> 00:42:58.305
But what about my bakery?

00:42:58.765 --> 00:43:01.105
You know how much I love baking, Dad.

00:43:01.235 --> 00:43:03.865
We can just hire a talented chef
to take over for now.

00:43:04.755 --> 00:43:06.985
Wait until I clear all this mess up.

00:43:07.715 --> 00:43:10.825
Then you can go back to
running your own shop.

00:43:18.645 --> 00:43:20.945
But Dad, I didn't graduate
from the Police Academy.

00:43:21.195 --> 00:43:23.065
I can’t shoot.

00:43:23.265 --> 00:43:25.345
Even firecrackers give me a heart attack.

00:43:25.425 --> 00:43:26.865
You don't need a degree
from the Academy.

00:43:27.055 --> 00:43:28.265
Don't have to touch a gun.

00:43:29.395 --> 00:43:31.585
There are other departments
where you can work.

00:43:33.165 --> 00:43:34.345
Like what?

00:43:47.535 --> 00:43:48.185
Go.

00:43:53.725 --> 00:43:55.185
Dad.

00:44:15.805 --> 00:44:16.705
P'Mart.

00:44:17.555 --> 00:44:20.705
Um, your documents.

00:44:24.125 --> 00:44:25.105
Are ready.

00:44:25.445 --> 00:44:27.825
So fast!

00:44:27.965 --> 00:44:32.385
Finished in just half an hour?
Anyone else would've taken an hour!

00:44:32.635 --> 00:44:36.425
You’re officially the number one pro
at photocopying.

00:44:36.565 --> 00:44:38.145
It's nothing,

00:44:38.285 --> 00:44:42.945
Um, when do the interpreting tasks start?

00:44:43.195 --> 00:44:43.985
Not yet.

00:44:44.145 --> 00:44:47.425
Most of the work right now is
for Chinese interpreters.

00:44:47.965 --> 00:44:52.225
How about you help me translate
some documents for the boss today?

00:44:52.765 --> 00:44:53.465
Here.

00:44:55.015 --> 00:44:57.065
All of these. Thank you.

00:45:14.645 --> 00:45:15.985
Dr. Anya is on the line, sir.

00:45:20.245 --> 00:45:21.345
Hello, Doctor.

00:45:22.165 --> 00:45:23.185
Hello.

00:45:23.645 --> 00:45:25.785
Has Mr. Phakphum
confirmed his availability yet?

00:45:26.565 --> 00:45:27.305
Not yet.

00:45:28.005 --> 00:45:31.025
Please follow up.

00:45:31.285 --> 00:45:35.545
No surgery now means a long wait,
as I'll be abroad.

00:45:36.315 --> 00:45:38.625
I'll inform him right away.

00:45:39.025 --> 00:45:40.945
- Thank you.
- Yes.

00:45:44.485 --> 00:45:45.545
She’s pushing for a schedule?

00:45:46.915 --> 00:45:47.665
Yes, sir.

00:45:49.435 --> 00:45:51.225
And while I’m in the hospital.

00:45:52.515 --> 00:45:53.825
Who’s going to watch over Vicky?

00:46:12.355 --> 00:46:14.905
How long has it been since
our last VIP protection training?

00:46:16.085 --> 00:46:17.385
Three years, sir.

00:46:24.275 --> 00:46:28.225
How about we invite Captain Tarn
from the Special Crimes Unit to join us?

00:46:29.145 --> 00:46:31.185
Captain Tarn. Who's that?

00:46:31.965 --> 00:46:34.425
Do you remember
who helped Vicky at the bakery?

00:46:37.045 --> 00:46:38.585
That was Captain Tarn.

00:46:40.445 --> 00:46:43.865
If we send her to train with Vicky,
you can rest easy.

00:46:55.725 --> 00:46:56.905
What’s this, P'Ken?

00:46:57.455 --> 00:46:58.945
The higher-ups invited you.

00:47:01.195 --> 00:47:02.185
No thanks.

00:47:02.995 --> 00:47:05.065
I'm already swamped with work until next year.

00:47:05.365 --> 00:47:08.385
Fine. I'll just tell them
you're not available.

00:47:10.645 --> 00:47:12.865
- I'll get back to work.
- Go ahead.

00:47:13.325 --> 00:47:19.105
You've been asking about him so much,
I thought you want to work with him?

00:47:21.685 --> 00:47:22.785
Who are you talking about?

00:47:24.685 --> 00:47:26.425
Mr. Phakphum, of course.

00:47:27.365 --> 00:47:31.145
He's running the training
and invited you personally.

00:47:32.405 --> 00:47:34.785
There's a rumor going around.

00:47:35.285 --> 00:47:38.025
That he's looking for a private bodyguard.

00:47:38.365 --> 00:47:39.945
That's why he only invited
the best of the best.

00:47:41.155 --> 00:47:42.185
But since you're not going,

00:47:42.505 --> 00:47:44.465
- I'll just shred this.
- Hey!

00:47:56.405 --> 00:47:57.225
All right.

00:47:57.685 --> 00:47:58.665
I'll go.

00:48:11.325 --> 00:48:12.185
Vicky.

00:48:13.565 --> 00:48:14.545
Vicky.

00:48:15.675 --> 00:48:16.585
Vicky.

00:48:17.605 --> 00:48:19.305
Sorry, how many copies do you need?

00:48:20.075 --> 00:48:21.625
I'm not asking for photocopies.

00:48:23.085 --> 00:48:25.265
Oh, Dad.

00:48:25.885 --> 00:48:27.425
Sorry.

00:48:28.365 --> 00:48:30.705
I've been making so many copies
I'm starting to lose it.

00:48:34.395 --> 00:48:35.905
Anyway, what is it?

00:48:37.445 --> 00:48:40.545
I want you to join
a special training session.

00:48:42.965 --> 00:48:44.065
Dad.

00:48:45.185 --> 00:48:50.305
I already agreed to work with you.

00:48:50.555 --> 00:48:52.545
Now you want me to do training too?

00:48:58.925 --> 00:49:00.745
I just don't want you to get bored.

00:49:01.125 --> 00:49:03.985
There aren't many
English interpreting jobs right now.

00:49:04.345 --> 00:49:06.505
So I thought you could do this
in the meantime.

00:49:07.165 --> 00:49:10.985
- What kind of VIP is this?
- It's for important people only.

00:49:11.325 --> 00:49:12.945
We don't host these very often.

00:49:16.405 --> 00:49:18.865
Do Thai celebrities
actually do this kind of training?

00:49:19.125 --> 00:49:20.265
Yes, Vicky.

00:49:21.045 --> 00:49:24.825
Only the top celebs.
And it's on a private beach.

00:49:27.355 --> 00:49:29.305
Just seven days, sweetie.

00:49:29.925 --> 00:49:33.065
Once you're done,
you can go back to your bakery.

00:49:33.295 --> 00:49:34.785
I won't force you to do anything else.

00:49:43.165 --> 00:49:44.145
So...

00:49:44.925 --> 00:49:45.985
When does it start?

00:50:10.685 --> 00:50:12.025
Don't you want to know, Mom?

00:50:12.655 --> 00:50:14.785
What really happened 19 years ago?

00:50:15.515 --> 00:50:19.625
Then stay far away from him.
Don't dig up the past.

00:50:24.525 --> 00:50:27.265
Help! Help! Help!

00:50:27.645 --> 00:50:30.705
Why are you doing this?

00:50:41.005 --> 00:50:42.545
My father once told me.

00:50:43.445 --> 00:50:44.705
if you do the right thing.

00:50:45.325 --> 00:50:47.945
You'll have no regrets,
even if it costs you your life.

00:50:48.085 --> 00:50:49.265

00:50:53.375 --> 00:50:56.625

(Presumed: Father was murdered in 2006)

00:50:57.965 --> 00:50:59.145
But I’m not afraid.

00:50:59.445 --> 00:51:01.905
(Involved in his father's death)
I will unmask him.

00:51:02.595 --> 00:51:04.785
And I will make him pay for what he did.

00:51:05.245 --> 00:51:07.305
(Accompanied by
a close subordinate named X)

00:51:07.525 --> 00:51:09.345
It’s Mr. Phakphum.

00:51:10.085 --> 00:51:13.785
He's running the training
and invited you personally.

00:51:13.955 --> 00:51:15.345
(Governor awards

Zero-Zero-Five.

Zero-Zero-Four.

00:51:39.215 --> 00:51:41.345
- Noey!
- Oh, Tarn!

00:51:41.765 --> 00:51:42.665
How did you get here?

00:51:43.005 --> 00:51:45.225
Senior at the unit had an urgent case,

00:51:45.365 --> 00:51:46.745
so I'm filling in for the medical unit.

00:51:51.285 --> 00:51:53.665
What time is it?
Why aren't you on the bus yet?

00:51:54.185 --> 00:51:56.825
Uh, not everyone is here yet.

00:51:57.645 --> 00:51:58.825
If they're not here, cut them.

00:51:59.215 --> 00:52:01.505
If you can't be on time,
how can you train?

00:52:03.045 --> 00:52:04.265
But we can't cut this one.

00:52:17.485 --> 00:52:18.985
Please wait 10 more minutes.

00:52:27.145 --> 00:52:28.425
They say someone hasn't arrived yet.

00:52:29.445 --> 00:52:30.265
Who is it?

00:52:32.885 --> 00:52:34.225
It's been an hour late already.

00:52:34.915 --> 00:52:36.185
They’re definitely going to get chewed out.

00:53:02.355 --> 00:53:04.865
Everyone, get in push-up position!

00:53:05.205 --> 00:53:05.985
Huh?

00:53:11.525 --> 00:53:13.785
You said you didn't want to be here
in the first place.

00:53:14.445 --> 00:53:17.505
So if you want to leave, I understand.

00:53:18.815 --> 00:53:21.025
I don't know who forced you to come.

00:53:22.205 --> 00:53:25.625
But I believe they mean well.

00:53:26.885 --> 00:53:28.105
If you can't handle this.

00:53:28.525 --> 00:53:30.185
You can't even go home. Go!
