00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.520
The duty of the Capital's Embroidered Uniform Guard

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.320
in the eyes of the common people,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.280
possesses the might of an eagle striking the sky,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.760
positioned high above in the heavens.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.760
Yet they do not know we toil day and night,

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.200
rising early and sleeping late,

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.720
seeking only not to disgrace the Imperial grace.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.480
Like hawks and hounds, claws and teeth,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.640
we obey the Eastern and Western Depots.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.920
I was raised and taught by the Eastern Depot since childhood.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.040
The grace of giving me a second life

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.800
must never be betrayed.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.800
However,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.440
holding a position requires fulfilling its duties.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.720
I must tread on thin ice all day long,

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.120
speaking and acting with caution.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.880
How can there be in this world

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.640
a perfect way to satisfy both sides?

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.080
Coroner,

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.960
have you determined the Superintendent's cause of death?

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.000
Replying to Your Honor,

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.520
I have examined carefully.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.000
The Superintendent

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.800
was killed by arrows

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.480
piercing vital spots.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.760
His face and arms

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.640
have superficial burn injuries,

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.600
but they were not fatal.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.440
In other words,

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.480
it was...

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.480
Impossible.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.720
I saw it clearly last night.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.480
It was the Embroidered Uniform Guard who ordered

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.880
the volley of arrows.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.120
How could they act so recklessly?

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.640
We absolutely cannot attribute Feng Hai's death

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.360
to the Embroidered Uniform Guard's poor command.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.040
If this gets out,

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.480
the Eastern Depot and the Embroidered Uniform Guard

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.080
will become the laughingstock of the entire capital.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.840
But right now,

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.600
the Grand Court of Justice knows Feng Hai's cause of death.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.440
Lord Shen,

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.400
gossip is hard to control.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.160
How can you, just because someone provoked you,

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.160
draw your blade to kill?

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.240
Then wouldn't Lord Shen have endless people to kill?

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.800
That would show a lack of magnanimity.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.000
Besides,

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.360
that Uncle Zhang's life is cheap.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.520
There is no need

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.880
for Lord Shen to do it himself.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.520
Right?

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.280
Such words,

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.720
do not let me hear them again.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.720
Better to think about why, on the Superintendent's body,

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.880
strange phenomena suddenly appeared.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.800
Last night,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.320
the Superintendent complained the execution ground was leaking.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.920
There has been no rain in the capital recently.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.560
Why would it leak?

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.320
It's the smell of pine resin.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.880
No wonder the water stains haven't dried overnight.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.480
Mixed in here are also

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.400
saltpeter,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.640
sulfur,

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:40.840
camphor,

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:42.560
and arsenic.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.200
Then there is no mistake.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.200
This is the Divine Machine Battalion's

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.760
recipe for the Fire Dragon Divine Artillery Formation.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.760
Igniting the substances to create smoke,

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.200
then dripping it onto the Superintendent's face and hands.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.200
Then using the clothes

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.200
and the illusion of falling snow to confuse the senses.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.160
It couldn't be more perfect.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.480
Vice Minister Zhang seems to be quite knowledgeable

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.720
about these firearms and mechanisms.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.320
What is so strange about that?

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.480
Vice Minister Zhang once served in the Divine Machine Battalion

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.520
under General Lin Feng.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.640
It would be strange if he didn't know.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.600
Correct.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.640
At this dripping speed,

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.360
in less than half an incense stick's time,

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:19.840
on the Superintendent's body,

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.200
enough quantity could accumulate.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.040
Then,

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.320
by using fire...

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.200
No.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.120
It was using wind to blind the eyes,

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.480
with chaotic butterflies, fire, and rising smoke.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.520
Before the execution supervision yesterday,

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.040
I had already asked the Imperial Observatory

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.160
to observe last night's celestial phenomena.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.320
A south wind would rise,

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.000
and there would be no fog.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.720
If the smoke on the Superintendent

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:49.920
was man-made,

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.440
then the fog

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.920
must also have been man-made.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.920
Who were those gathered in the south last night?

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.520
They were all opera singers and jugglers.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.640
Their props were all prepared there.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.200
A sturdy hardwood handle for stability.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.120
The tube is filled with sand and gunpowder, then lit

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.440
to generate smoke.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.160
Riding the south wind,

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.560
it drifted to the execution platform.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.120
The common people last night

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.720
could no longer distinguish reality from illusion.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.840
First came the spring snow,

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.040
and the scent of plum blossoms.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:46.760
The people all thought

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.320
that as the petals drifted away,

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.680
mixed with sparks,

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.680
they ignited the Superintendent.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.200
The supervising official disappeared.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:54.760
Form the arrow formation!

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:55.640
Fire!

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.400
From this, we can see

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.840
that the Superintendent's death

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.560
was not caused by supernatural forces,

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.840
but by the arrows of the Embroidered Uniform Guard.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.800
Illusion Magic

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.200
is achieved through drugs

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.320
or mystical techniques.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.080
What appears does not truly exist.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.200
Or perhaps,

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.040
it is a trick of the eye.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.640
In that case,

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:22.880
all the inconsistencies

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.080
can be easily explained.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.160
But last night,

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.960
the realism of fighting that evil ghost

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:27.840
still lingers.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.400
It must be

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.520
more than just simple Illusion Magic.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.240
Flowers in a mirror,

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.000
truth amidst the void.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.520
To make the battle-hardened Embroidered Uniform Guard

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.720
believe in

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.520
the authenticity of the illusion,

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.600
it shows that within it,

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.080
there must be something real.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.200
At the time of the execution,

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.360
everyone was affected by the Nuo opera masks.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.640
Therefore,

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.520
what appeared to everyone

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.440
was related to the Nuo opera masks.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:58.920
But,

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.400
there are millions of ghosts and monsters in the world.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.320
What appears in everyone's mind

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.520
must be different.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:05.600
So,

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.000
the key to seeing through the trick of the eye

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.520
is actually very simple.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.120
Find the one thing they all saw the same,

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:12.760
and that is the real one.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.360
This evil ghost moved with floating agility,

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.400
weaving freely through the Embroidered Uniform Guard.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.440
Even when struck with fatal wounds,

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.720
its speed never diminished.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.760
This struck fear into the Embroidered Uniform Guard,

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.360
causing them to lose judgment.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.360
Carved wooden puppets,

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.200
half like gods, half like ghosts.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.760
Their forms carved to mimic reality.

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.040
With the pull of a string,

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.400
they come to life.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.200
It is Puppetry.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.240
As long as the controller's hands can move,

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.600
it can fight without dying.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.520
This person is a woman from the Western Regions

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.120
Dressed in red

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.800
With slender, jade-like fingers

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.440
And a charming face

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.640
Every gesture she makes

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.160
Exudes an alluring aura

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:10.840
Well?

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:11.840
Is the drawing finished?

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:12.840
It's done, it's done

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.000
My Lord

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:15.280
Look

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.640
You really are as excellent as ever

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.280
This is a veteran of illusion magic

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.080
A puppeteer in the Western Region style

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.760
I'll have Shuimo and Danqing

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.080
Go to town and ask about their appearance

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.040
Lord Zhang

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.080
Are you sure you didn't over-beautify the assassin?

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:43.880
Is she pretty?

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.720
Could it be you've taken a fancy to this Dou E Snow Girl?

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:50.680
My Lords

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.080
You've misunderstood

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.680
Whenever it's a good-looking

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.800
And charming young woman

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:55.920
Our Lord

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.160
Never forgets a face

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.440
And captures it perfectly in drawing

00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:59.720
I think this girl

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.760
Has top-tier looks

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.880
Which happens to suit our Lord's taste

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:03.880
Come off it

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:04.760
Rather than calling her a girl

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.640
It's better to call her a little lunatic

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.120
I fought her last night

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.320
Her martial arts come from the Tang Clan

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.600
She excels in light footwork, short crossbows, and daggers

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.080
And the hidden weapons she uses are rare too

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:16.720
You could say

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.080
She is a peerless expert

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.240
If it is truly as Lord Zhang says

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:21.680
We should very soon

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.000
Be able to arrest these three suspects

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.200
My Lord

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.600
We searched from door to door

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.840
But found no trace of Li Chenyang

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:30.440
Yes

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.560
Although Li Chenyang is the Minister of War

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.200
He is merely a civil official

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.880
The capital was sealed off immediately

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.280
Where could he have fled to?

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:50.880
Last night, the Snow Girl

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.920
Descended from the sky to Li Chenyang's side

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.200
But even with her superior martial arts

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.560
She couldn't possibly take Lord Li, a mere civil official

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.960
And hijack him away from the execution ground

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:03.640
I think it was

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:08.920
A bait-and-switch

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.440
Battalion Commander Yuan

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.560
Check the Embroidered Uniform Guard death toll last night

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.120
The body count at the scene last night

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.440
Two officials were beheaded

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.720
Fifteen Embroidered Uniform Guards

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.400
Seven claimed by relatives in the capital

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:36.200
Also

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.160
Check last night's roster

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:38.840
If I remember correctly

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.200
The non-local Embroidered Uniform Guards supervising

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.480
Should only number seven people

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.400
In that case

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:45.720
Our Lord Li

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.040
Should be in the safest place in the capital

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:16.720
Girl

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:18.600
This place

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.600
Has its taboos

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.560
You can't just lie down here

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.440
My fortune is heavy enough to suppress it

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.800
I'm afraid you'll suffocate Lord Li

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:57.280
Search!

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:57.920
Yes, sir!

00:12:59.000 --> 00:12:59.480
You go over there.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:00.800
This way. This way.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:06.880
Check over there.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.240
Reporting, my lord.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:09.720
Nothing found.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:10.880
Reporting, my lord.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:11.560
Nothing here either.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.760
Where are the bodies of the Guards sent last night?

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:22.680
Reporting, Battalion Commander.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.240
The bodies of the deceased Guards...

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.480
...were all claimed last night.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.320
It is already dawn.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.640
The non-local officers should be preparing to leave the city.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.360
The city is sealed for three days.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.680
Who authorized you to send bodies out of the city?

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:37.960
Please calm your anger, Commissioner.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.200
Let's go.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.400
Commissioner Shen, no need to be anxious.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:49.680
Vice Minister Zhang.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.680
Why don't you focus on catching the suspect?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.720
I will lead the Embroidered Uniform Guard to track Li Chenyang.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:54.640
How about that?

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.000
The Grand Court of Justice and the Embroidered Uniform Guard are investigating together.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.360
The Grand Court naturally won't slack off.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:13:59.960
But rest assured, Commissioner Shen.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.120
We have arranged men to catch the suspect in the city.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.760
This Li Chenyang definitely cannot escape.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.480
You really think of everything.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.920
The capital is under curfew for three days.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:12.960
Why are you leaving the city?

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.040
The bodies of these seven non-local Guards...

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:18.680
...must be sent out immediately.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.320
To be buried in their hometowns.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.800
This is a document specially approved by His Majesty for the Commander.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:27.280
Hold on.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:34.800
We are under orders to investigate...

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:35.920
...the case of Li Chenyang's abduction.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:36.880
We suspect...

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.320
...that Li Chenyang is hiding...

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.160
...inside these coffins.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.000
So we must open the coffins to inspect the bodies now.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:51.080
Well...

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:54.920
My lord.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:55.480
My lord!

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:56.520
You can't open them!

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.160
This is our young master.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.160
Opening the coffin during transport...

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.680
...is a great taboo!

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:03.880
Men!

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:04.960
My lord!

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:05.640
Open the coffins!

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.000
My lord! You can't, my lord! My lord!

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:08.800
My lord!

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.160
Where exactly did we go wrong?

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.560
Commissioner Shen, no need to blame yourself.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.360
Perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.480
These unruly people.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.560
They have no manners at all.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:36.880
What is this?

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.040
It's disgusting.

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:39.840
Let me see.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.720
It smells of pig skin and yellow mud.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.400
These are materials needed for the Art of Disguise.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:52.640
Who was the one hugging you and crying just now?

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.080
A diversion.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.320
They tampered with the coffins on purpose...

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.520
...to draw our attention...

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:01.680
...to the bodies inside the coffins.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.120
Causing us to overlook...

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.520
...the people taking the coffins out.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:05.680
By now, they must be...

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:06.600
...on the official road out of the city.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.440
We absolutely cannot let Li Chenyang escape the capital.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:09.560
Battalion Commander Yuan.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:10.400
Here.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.360
Do a headcount.

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.520
Follow me out of the city to make the arrest.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.280
Vice Minister Zhang, stay and guard the city.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:15.760
In case of any unexpected incidents.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.520
When it comes to stealing credit...

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.240
...Commissioner Shen really doesn't hold back at all.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:50.920
My Lord! My Lord!

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:51.640
This lowly one is...

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.400
Wang Xi, the steward of Taiyuan Prefecture in Shanxi.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.240
Please spare my life!

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.960
Everyone, present your travel documents.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.880
Examine every word and sentence carefully.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.360
If anyone has forged them,

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:00.760
kill them on the spot.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.000
My Lord.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.160
Here are his documents.

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:10.560
Wang Xi.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.080
Raise your head.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.120
Do you not understand My Lord's words?

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.280
If you hesitate for another moment,

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.920
careful, or I'll make your head leave your shoulders.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.280
My Lord.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.280
This man's behavior doesn't seem faked.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:26.680
If he were using the Art of Disguise,

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.560
there should be signs of the skin peeling.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:32.600
My Lord.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.040
My Lord, spare me!

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.440
This face is real.

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.400
Indeed, there are no signs of disguise.

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.800
Li Chenyang doesn't even fear beheading.

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.880
How could he be scared into such a state by us?

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.360
Where did you get this stain?

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:50.800
In reply to My Lord,

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.400
it was when I was transporting the Little Young Master's body.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.160
I brushed against the coffin.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.520
I thought it was nothing,

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:57.720
so I didn't pay it any mind.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:58.400
I didn't expect

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.000
to bring bad luck to My Lord.

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.640
My Lord, spare me!

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:03.200
Forget it.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.160
Where have the others transporting the coffin gone?

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:07.080
In reply to My Lord,

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:07.840
I heard

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.080
they returned to the official residence in the old capital, Jiangnan.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.880
You should know how the Embroidered Uniform Guard operates.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.400
For the sake of your Little Young Master,

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.720
who once served the Embroidered Uniform Guard,

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.720
we will not pursue this matter with you today.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.920
Thank you, My Lord.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.240
If word spreads from Shanxi Prefecture

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.360
regarding any gossip about today,

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.200
do not blame us for disregarding past sentiments.

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.440
Now get lost, hurry!

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.920
Thank you, My Lord.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.520
Go, quickly.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.720
Thank you, My Lord. Thank you, My Lord.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.880
Along all official roads leaving the capital,

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:40.520
and the small paths,

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.120
pursue their whereabouts.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.080
Investigate everyone's identity clearly.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.000
Return and report.

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.080
If there is anything suspicious,

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.080
kill them on the spot.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:50.920
You treacherous castrated thief!

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.520
You treacherous castrated thief!

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.800
Framing the loyal and good!

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.600
Murdering

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.600
innocent commoners!

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.360
Robbing the rich and deceiving superiors!

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.080
Seeking personal gain!

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.320
Your crimes are truly heinous!

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:06.280
Today,

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.920
I shall take your life

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:09.800
and cast you into

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:14.000
the eighteen hells!

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.720
Good, good, good.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.320
My Lord.

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:38.040
This mortal world

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.880
is full of injustice.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.800
Please hide with me for three days

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:47.760
to find ironclad proof of innocence.

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:48.440
My Lord.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.160
While you were away,

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.000
a group of people

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.720
set up a stage here to perform.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.400
Among them, a woman in white

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.760
matches the figure of last night's assassin.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:57.960
This is clearly

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.680
a provocation to the Eastern Depot's authority.

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:02.560
Furthermore,

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.560
Vice Minister Zhang Yi of the Grand Court of Justice

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.400
clearly knows something is amiss,

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.720
yet refuses to arrest them.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.520
This...

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:14.800
What do you know?

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.400
Arresting them now

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.520
would only alert the enemy.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:20.560
Observing them closely

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.440
is the best strategy.

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:27.440
In three days, your name will be cleared,

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:31.640
and you shall return to the world.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.040
Thank you for saving me today, heroine.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.240
Heaven's justice is clear.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.440
I, Li Chenyang, have heaven and earth as my witness.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.360
I die with no regrets.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.320
I believe that one day,

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.080
the truth will come to light.

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:51.000
My Lord,

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.880
not arresting them now,

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.080
isn't that inappropriate?

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.360
The people of the capital are watching.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:58.960
If the Eastern Depot

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.320
suspects that our Grand Court of Justice

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.080
is intentionally shielding them,

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.160
wouldn't that be even more troublesome?

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.240
As long as they resist arrest in public,

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:07.800
their guilt

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.200
will be confirmed.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.680
Let me handle it.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:11.680
You?

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.000
If things go wrong, heads will roll.

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.040
I'll do it.

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:28.920
Audacious suspect!

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.280
Surrender at once!

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.480
My Lord,

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.000
why would you, for no reason,

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.200
attack a humble woman?

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.720
The Grand Court is committing violence in the street!

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.400
Your Grand Court is too bold!

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.040
Do you know who she is?

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:39.960
I don't care who she is.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.560
You are now a suspect involved

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:43.680
in last night's abduction case.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:45.560
Return with me to the Grand Court.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:46.440
My Lord,

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:48.440
I'm injured.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:49.800
I can't walk.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:50.400
Take her away.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:08.640
Lord Shen.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:09.800
Thank you for your trouble, Vice Minister Zhang.

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.560
This case has made new progress.

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.120
You are too kind, Lord Shen.

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:33.240
Tang Xi.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.040
Young Master of the Tang Clan.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.560
Rose to fame in the martial world at thirteen.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.240
Known as

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.360
Gateless.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.520
Put your legs down.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:57.720
Have you no manners?

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:04.960
Don't think that just because you're a girl,

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.880
I can't handle you.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.280
In the Tang Clan,

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:12.720
I am the rule.

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:13.880
This is the Grand Court of Justice.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.320
In the Grand Court of Justice, I am the rule.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.440
Don't think that because the Tang Clan is a Jianghu clan,

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.600
with the Imperial Court's protection,

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.840
that you can do as you please

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.040
and evade punishment.

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.760
If you don't want to implicate the Tang Clan,

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.040
then confess honestly.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.040
Why did you hijack Li Chenyang?

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.040
Where is Li Chenyang now?

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:44.920
Speak!

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.560
Where is your skill at talking back now?

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.320
Skill?

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.280
Naturally, I have it.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.680
I, Wu Qiangu, have traveled far and wide.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.000
I have seen all the strange arts under heaven.

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.240
You common people,

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.640
how could you grasp the methods?

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.360
So you're saying,

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.480
you admit to conspiring with Tang Xi and Yuan Ran,

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.280
using exquisite illusion magic

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.520
to hijack Li Chenyang?

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.280
Where is Li Chenyang now?

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.200
Lord Commissioner,

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:22.400
when did I admit to this fatal crime?

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:24.920
I, Wu Qiangu,

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.120
though a lowly person of the Jianghu,

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:30.560
cannot be so

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.800
framed like this.

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.320
If it wasn't you,

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:41.440
then how do you explain that before the execution,

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:42.960
you gave the commoners

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:43.800
plum blossom branches containing illusion powder?

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:44.760
Plum blossom branches containing illusion powder?

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.080
Of course, it was for

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.400
the elegant pleasure of gifting floral scents.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:51.760
Besides,

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.880
that kind of illusion at the execution ground,

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:56.560
how can it be considered exquisite?

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.240
The art of withering and flourishing plants...

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.000
In this world,

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.440
the true exquisite illusion magic is

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:09.640
resurrection from the dead.

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:10.960
Life and death,

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.040
changing endlessly.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:14.920
My Lord,

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.680
do you want to learn?

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:23.960
You monster.

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:25.440
Where is Li Chenyang?

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.360
My Lord seems

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.840
indifferent to life, death, or reputation.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.560
Then why do your eyes

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:36.080
reveal a hint of interest?

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.200
Is it that your parents are in their twilight years?

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:42.320
No.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.040
Not parents.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.360
It is a close relative.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.760
To raise My Lord to be so cute,

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.440
they must be a person of high status and power.

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.280
You are plotting something.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:14.640
What are you doing up there?

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.720
Can't I be up here?

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:23.360
This prison cell is really terribly stuffy.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.040
I can't catch my breath.

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.240
My chest feels tight.

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:28.840
I'm so tired now.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.640
Little official, can you do me a favor?

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.720
Help me undo my clothes.

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.160
What "Little official"?

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:39.200
I am a dignified rank 5 Battalion Commander of the Embroidered Uniform Guard.

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.040
You sit over there for me.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.280
I won't.

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:53.600
Yuan Ran.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.120
From the Western Regions.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:00.520
Last night before the execution,

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.600
why did you sing "The Injustice to Dou E"?

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.600
Carrying a puppet to commit murder at the execution ground.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.320
Your puppet...

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.600
Where is your puppet now?

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.400
Little official, you've touched my sore spot.

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.000
That puppet of mine...

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.480
I don't know which bastard

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.600
stole it away.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.000
That was

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.680
made from the bones of my short-lived husband.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:28.040
As soon as I mention this, my chest hurts terribly.

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:29.440
Little official,

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.040
hurry and rub it for me.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:50.880
How did it go?

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.400
That sorcerer Wu Qiangu...

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.280
his sorcery is formidable.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.800
He knows mind-reading spells.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.120
He's truly hard to figure out.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:00.320
That's nothing.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.160
That Western Region woman named Yuan Ran...

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.160
is more terrifying than my father's concubines.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:05.760
I suspect my chastity

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:06.640
has been tainted.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.480
That Tang Xi refuses to say a word.

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.200
He's wearing down my patience.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.520
It's fine if he doesn't talk.

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:13.560
If he won't talk, hand him over.

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:14.600
I need to calm down a bit.

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:17.560
Wait a moment.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.040
Let's go.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:40.760
Tang Xi.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.600
The Young Master of the Tang Clan.

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:47.960
Switching people already?

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.480
Wu Qiangu.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.400
Known in the Jianghu as Cloth Tiger.

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.000
Skilled in gambling techniques,

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.040
Illusion Magic,

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.000
and tricks of the eye.

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.600
Nothing but useless tricks.

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.920
Thank you for the compliment, my lord.

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:06.960
I'm just trying to make a living

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.480
in the Jianghu, that's all.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:11.720
This official is even more handsome

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:12.960
than that little official just now.

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.680
I wonder if you can be a bit tougher.

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.600
Don't think that just because you're a woman,

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.400
I won't beat you.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.800
Are you planning to interrogate us in shifts?

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.720
I advise you to give up.

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.120
I've been trained.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.920
I can outlast even the hawks of the Western Regions,

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:29.960
let alone humans.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.000
If possible,

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.720
please write down a name for me.

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:41.080
Does the Embroidered Uniform Guard skip torture now

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.520
and go straight for a blank confession?

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.320
I simply admire you.

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.280
I want to know a bit more about you.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.160
Let's be friends first.

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.280
If you want to beat or scold me, go ahead, my lord.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.960
Instead of saying these bluffing words,

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.520
why not do something meaningful?

00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.720
What a bunch of lunatics.

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:05.480
Let me tell you,

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.440
the one you moved against this time

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:08.880
is the Superintendent of the Eastern Depot.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.360
Tang Xi has the Tang Clan's protection.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.760
You and Yuan Ran are veterans of the Jianghu.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.200
You should know clearly

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.040
when disaster strikes,

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.560
how to play it safe.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.040
I was innocent to begin with.

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:21.360
If the Depot and Guard are determined to frame me,

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.520
there's nothing I can do about it.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:25.640
The city is sealed for three days.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.120
The time the Eastern Depot left for the Grand Court of Justice

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:29.400
doesn't seem to be much.

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:34.440
Speak.

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.680
After Li Chenyang was hijacked last night,

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:37.920
where did you go?

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.400
Where did Li Chenyang go?

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.600
I haven't eaten since yesterday.

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:44.920
How about

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.240
you cook a bowl of noodles for me?

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.440
I am very curious.

00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.720
With your current martial arts skills,

00:30:58.720 --> 00:30:59.400
could you not

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.280
slaughter the entire Grand Court of Justice and escape?

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.720
You killed Feng Hai anyway.

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.360
So the word "slaughter"

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.080
is a term of praise at the Grand Court of Justice.

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.400
Let me take a good look at you.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.480
This full official uniform...

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.960
I remember the Vice Minister of the Grand Court of Justice

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:21.320
seems to be

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.920
a soldier returned from the battlefield, right?

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.640
Can you not stand the sight of red?

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.760
Why is it red?

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.960
Is it the glow of the setting sun?

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.960
Is it war banners and armor?

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:45.120
Is the heart red like soldiers' blood?

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.280
Tell me.

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:50.440
What did you see?

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:51.560
What is it

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.720
that causes you such pain?

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:53.800
Get away!

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:12.240
Speak. Where is Li Chenyang?

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:14.320
Um...

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:16.640
Am I disturbing you?

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:17.800
Please continue.

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:18.960
Vice Minister Zhang.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:21.280
What is it?

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:23.600
Come here.

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:32.960
This is a disaster.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.920
Someone has escaped.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:39.760
Here, give that to me.

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:40.600
Here, give that to me.

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:45.480
Isn't this a coincidence?

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:46.760
Isn't this the Lord Zhang...

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:48.200
...who arrested us just now?

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.320
What happened?

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.120
Nothing.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.520
What could possibly happen?

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:00.360
You big shots love beating around the bush.

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.120
Let me just ask you something.

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:03.960
How is your relationship with Tang Xi?

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:04.760
Is that any of your business?

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.520
Of course it has nothing to do with me.

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:08.520
But she just took Battalion Commander Yuan hostage...

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.560
...and escaped the Grand Court of Justice.

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:10.920
Does that have anything to do with you?

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.600
Is that crazy girl even human?

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:16.800
I... I'll tell...

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:18.200
...those old fogies at the Tang Clan...

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.200
...that she did such an outrageous thing.

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.880
I was completely out of my mind.

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:27.520
Alright then.

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:31.600
Darn it.

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.000
Flattery didn't work.

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:49.600
So you've switched to coercion.

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:50.800
Getting serious now.

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.680
Harsh punishments and strict laws...

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:54.440
...break the courage of traitors.

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:56.200
As long as we pry open one person's mouth...

00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:59.160
...the others are sure to talk.

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:01.960
My Lord.

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.600
Were you scared just now?

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:06.320
Or afraid I'd find out something about you?

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.200
Just now, you indeed...

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:10.320
...triggered some memories for me.

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.120
But coincidentally...

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.600
When I was relaxing outside just now...

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.160
...I happened to hear Miss Yuan Ran and Lord Shen...

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:17.240
...being all lovey-dovey.

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:19.400
...and they accidentally let slip...

00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:20.560
...that it was the Tang Clan elders...

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.280
...who told her to protect Tang Xi.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.320
Lord Zhang's chain stratagem...

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:29.880
...is a bit crude.

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:33.840
Not at all.

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.960
After all, the things the Embroidered Uniform Guard uses...

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.440
...you know better than I do.

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:44.320
There are only things the Depots and Guards don't want to know.

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:46.240
After all, this...

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.440
...was once concocted by you.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:51.520
Its potency and severity...

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.480
...I believe you know better than I do.

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.880
You, Tang Xi, and Yuan Ran kidnapping Li Chenyang...

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.040
...is already a felony.

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:04.440
Speak.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.080
Why did you do this?

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.320
Where is Li Chenyang now?

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.960
This Bone-Corroding Incense...

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:11.960
If an ordinary person consumes it...

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:14.320
...even if they spill the truth...

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.400
...they will become demented and dull.

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:18.200
Would you use it...

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:20.720
...on the Tang Clan's Young Mistress?

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:23.640
Naturally, it is used on...

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:25.640
...people who aren't that important.

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:29.680
Whose life are you treating as cheap?

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:31.480
Whether a life is cheap or not...

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:32.680
...depends on whether you tell the truth.
