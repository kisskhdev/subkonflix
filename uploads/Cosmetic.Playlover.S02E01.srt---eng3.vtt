00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.720
Alright, let's shoot.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.780
Chest out a bit more.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:12.510
Mamiya-san.

00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:14.751
Show the same attitude you
have when greeting customers.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:16.990
Imagine there's a customer in front of you.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.070
Yes.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.270
Ah, that's good.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.370
(Go for it!)

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.750
Ugh...

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.500
Why do I have to be in it too?

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.530
Very good.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.650
Alright, let's shoot.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.759
Okay, let's take a group photo.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.170
Mamiya-san, please.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.430
Alright, then I'll leave it to you.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:51.950
Okay.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.500
How about you try looking at each other?

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.170
Ah, that's nice.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.690
Ah, perfect.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:58.880
Wonderful.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.290
A little closer, Mamiya-san.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.860
Good, good.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.700
(ROMY FEERIQUE JAPAN)

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.100
Ugh, my shoulders are stiff
from doing things I'm not used to...

00:01:14.856 --> 00:01:16.226
Anyway, why did I have
to be in the shoot too?

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.790
Isn't this the ad you took on?

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.710
What does it matter?

00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:21.560
Isn't this a great opportunity
to promote male BA jobs?

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.730
Well, that's true, but...

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.740
I'm not like you, who used to be a model.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.770
I'm amazed you can stay so calm
with so many cameras and eyes on you.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.910
Because that's what I used to do.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.030
How irritating.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.370
Natsume-san.

00:01:37.371 --> 00:01:39.199
You were really nervous
just now, weren't you?

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.220
No, I wasn't.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.520
- No, you clearly were.
- I said I wasn't!

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.460
I... I'm sorry.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.130
Excuse me, are you Mamiya-san?

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.226
The winner of the the Rookie of the Year
award in management at the awards ceremony?

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.250
That's me...

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.660
It really is you!

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.590
Um... I'm a first-year BA this year.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.686
I read your article in
the in-house magazine.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.340
I really want to be like Mamiya-san too.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.050
Um... I...

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.470
I'll do my best!

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.340
Thank you.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.770
Go for it!

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.020
Okay.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.270
Excuse me.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.370
Huh...

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.220
It's my first time hearing someone
say something like that to me.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.800
It seems there are quite a few rookies

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.370
who are influenced by Natsume-san.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.750
That wasn't my intention.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.996
Regardless of your
intention, that's how it is.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.020
Huh?

00:02:27.783 --> 00:02:29.760
Well then, let's get back to our work.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.920
Mm.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.300
My job is a BA, as in...

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.430
Beauty Advisor.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.940
Also commonly known as...

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.410
a 'beauty consultant'.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.920
I've been a BA for five years now.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.810
Currently,

00:02:46.137 --> 00:02:50.847
I'm the chief manager at this Romy Feerique
Yurakucho store.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.330
From skincare advice to
cosmetic recommendations,

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.840
we connect with customers through 'beauty',

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.530
and make them smile.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.630
That's what we, BAs, do.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:05.790
Welcome.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.370
Are you looking for anything in particular?

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.000
I'd like to try the new lipstick.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.610
The one on the poster.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.479
Ah, thank you.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.700
I'll show you right away.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.540
Before,

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.000
at this very store,

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.180
I was forced to team up with
Sahashi as the 'Two Princes' for sales.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.360
And that Sahashi, now...

00:03:31.415 --> 00:03:33.625
has become Romy's exclusive makeup artist.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:34.650
Here you go.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.359
Thank you.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.000
This is a natural coral shade.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.260
I think it's a very easy color to wear.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.320
Hey.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.030
Are you and Mamiya getting along?

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.280
There's nothing for you to worry about.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.510
Oh dear.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.100
If you two fight, I...

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.839
could use 'worrying about Mamiya'
as an excuse to get closer to him.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.850
I won't give you the chance.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.000
Just kidding, just kidding.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.460
But it's nice, isn't it?

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.230
Coming home,

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.010
to a life with Mamiya there.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.130
Unlike me, I'm always alone.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.050
Don't you have anyone?

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.430
If you'd be willing to give Mamiya to me...

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.480
I said I was just kidding!

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.000
Don't glare at me like that.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.060
And I...

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:35.980
am now with Sahashi...

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.000
living together.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.140
I can do it myself.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.510
It's fine.

00:04:43.886 --> 00:04:45.386
It feels so good...

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.420
Hey.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.060
When you were a rookie,
did you have anything that bothered you?

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.950
Why are you asking that all of a sudden?

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.630
No, it's nothing.

00:04:56.631 --> 00:04:59.111
I just thought maybe you went
through something back then too.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.070
Well...

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.710
Natsume-san is too much of a workaholic.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.100
Working hard is natural, isn't it?

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.860
- I just think you could do better.
- Mind your own business.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.080
I...

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.700
I've never lied to you about work.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.940
You really are excellent.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.620
At most, you just feel tired, right?

00:05:21.902 --> 00:05:22.926
Well, I'm sorry about that.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.690
That's totally useless.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:25.740
Huh?

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.130
No...

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.230
I just remembered that
rookie who spoke to me today.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.776
I read your article in
the in-house magazine.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.470
I really want to be like Mamiya-san too.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.090
Are you that concerned about that rookie?

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.100
No...

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.640
It's not what you think.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:43.210
How should I put it...

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.600
Up until now,

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.720
I've only focused on my own counter,

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.440
and my customers.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.310
I just wanted to become
the ideal BA for myself.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.180
Not for anyone else.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:57.980
But...

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.310
You take this color and put it here.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.600
What do you think?

00:06:02.652 --> 00:06:05.562
Just like how I admired
Tanouchi-san when I was a child,

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.780
the thought that there might
be juniors looking up to me,

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.830
makes me want to become an even better BA.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.060
If I become Romy's number one BA,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.960
could someone like me
help those struggling on the front lines?

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.640
Or help those who are hesitant
about entering this profession?

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:32.930
Something like that.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.860
Natsume-san, you can definitely do it.

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:42.770
What about you?

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.360
Do you have any goals?

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.130
Like, what kind of person do
you want to become in the future?

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.059
As long as I can make
Natsume-san think I'm amazing,

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.060
I'm fine with anything.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.510
You're always like this.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.390
But, I mean, if...

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:56.610
If I become Romy's number one BA,

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:57.940
then,

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.570
if you could also become the
number one makeup artist...

00:07:03.893 --> 00:07:05.923
It feels like a dream.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.790
If it's Natsume-san's dream,
I'll make it come true.

00:07:11.473 --> 00:07:12.473
To be number one.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.090
You said it.

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.070
You can't go back on your word.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:18.940
Okay.

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:22.790
Hey, that was a surprise attack.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.630
So, how about a proper kiss?

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.250
That's not what I meant...

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:48.800
"Cosmetic Playlover" Season 2
(Episode 1)

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.440
What do you think?

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:03.980
- It's beautiful.
- Right?

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.300
Then, please try this color too.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.410
- I'll remove this for you first.
- Okay.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:12.370
Sir.

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:14.849
The new product samples are almost used up.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:16.650
I'll go ahead and order
more to replace them.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:17.420
Thank you.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.420
Okay.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:21.930
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.250
Natsume-kun, good work.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:28.910
You too, good work.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.880
Tanouchi-san is...

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:33.330
someone I used to admire.

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:35.709
He was also the reason I became a BA.

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:37.430
I was doing sales rounds nearby,

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:39.190
so I stopped by to restock the samples.

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:40.860
Oh, thank you very much.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.010
I was just about to
place an additional order.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.520
The new products seem to be selling well.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:48.530
Yes, thanks to everyone's support.

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.530
Oh, by the way, did you know?

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.030
Emma Lauren is coming to Japan from Paris.

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.250
Huh?

00:09:55.251 --> 00:09:58.370
She's holding a workshop to train
Japanese makeup artists.

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:01.480
Of course, Sahashi is also
one of the workshop participants.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:04.659
He didn't say anything...

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:08.500
No, he hasn't been informed of this yet.

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.560
It was decided to coincide with
her sudden decision to visit Japan.

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:15.300
Headquarters should contact him today.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.300
What?

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:19.830
So you found out first, huh...

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.300
Mm.

00:10:21.325 --> 00:10:22.570
Today, Tanouchi-san...

00:10:24.232 --> 00:10:29.390
Well, it's amazing to be able to participate
in a workshop with Romy's top makeup artist.

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:30.690
Yeah, well...

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:32.800
I think it's a good opportunity,

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:35.280
but the annoying thing
is Nanjo-san is there too.

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:36.610
Huh? Nanjo-san is going too?

00:10:37.449 --> 00:10:38.649
How has Nanjo-san been lately?

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.866
He's been incredibly energetic.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.770
Energetic to the point
of being a bit annoying.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.220
Is Emma-san... still mad at me?

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:54.450
No, it's not that.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.370
Remember that one time,

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.540
I canceled on Emma-san at
the last minute for dinner?

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:01.510
I'm sorry.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.040
I can't make it.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.680
Something urgent came up.

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:06.550
I'm sorry.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:09.490
Natsume-kun!

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:13.310
I really need to apologize for that.

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:16.950
But she probably doesn't even remember me.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:19.910
She's the kind of person...

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.190
I don't think she'd
mind something like that.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:23.970
Why?

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:25.790
Do you two know each other?

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:27.710
Um...

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:29.889
Anyway, what do you want for dinner?

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:30.460
Huh?

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:31.520
Oh, right.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.509
During the workshop, I
can leave work at 5 PM.

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:35.509
What would you like to
eat? I can make it every day.

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:36.630
You're changing the subject!

00:11:57.830 --> 00:11:59.700
It's past ten already.

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:05.140
It's been a while since I slept so soundly.

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:06.450
Mm.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.600
Hey.

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.340
Since it's your day off, how
about we go out for lunch?

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:13.910
A date?

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:16.610
Yeah, something like that.

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:22.436
There's a good place nearby that I know of.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:23.660
Oh? Really?

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:24.880
Then let's go there.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:29.320
This is it.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:30.820
Oh, nice.

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:32.600
- Let's go.
- Mm.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.390
Toma!

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:37.900
Bonjour!

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:40.710
Hello.

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:42.470
Huh?!

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:47.090
Huh?!

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:49.650
I'm Emma Lauren.

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.480
Nice to meet you.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.020
Um...

00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:58.910
I'm...

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.270
Mamiya Natsume.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.180
Huh?

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:05.370
You're the one who stood me
up at the last minute, aren't you?

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:08.370
I'm very sorry.

00:13:09.193 --> 00:13:11.683
At that time, there were
some circumstances...

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.740
Wait, you speak Japanese?

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.560
Emma's mother is Japanese.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:17.940
Her husband is also Japanese.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:20.190
Oh...

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.250
So you two really do know each other.

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:23.910
So?

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:28.210
What was so important that it was more
important than having dinner with me?

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:30.740
That's because...

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.360
Because he came to me.

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:34.519
He said he wanted to
make up after our fight.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.880
So he was quite restless.

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:36.910
You...

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:37.970
Oh dear.

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:41.410
So you mean Toma is more important than me?

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:44.850
At that time...

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:47.660
I absolutely wanted to be with him...

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.360
So...

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.280
I'm truly very sorry.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.250
You don't have to apologize so formally.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.960
Natsume, you're really honest.

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:07.550
Natsume, why did you join Romy?

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:08.660
Ah.

00:14:08.661 --> 00:14:10.959
Because my mother was
a Romy beauty consultant.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.880
I've admired this job since I was little.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.200
I see.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:15.740
Do you like this job?

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.310
Do you have any plans for the future?

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.320
Yes, I do.

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:21.280
My dream is to become
Romy's top beauty consultant.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.680
Excellent.

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:25.720
You shine so brightly.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.660
Just as Tanouchi-kun said.

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:30.420
Full of hope.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.040
And so honest.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:35.130
You'll definitely be fine.

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:36.170
Go for it!

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:37.750
Yes!

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:39.550
Merci.

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.180
Compared to him,

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:51.190
you're still as charmless as ever, Toma.

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.470
I thought you might have
become a little more likable.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:55.640
Really?

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.980
But my temper is much
better than it was back then.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:00.130
Huh?

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:01.850
Why is the atmosphere so tense?

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.810
Natsume, listen to me.

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:08.970
During the last workshop,

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.440
Toma, he was...

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.080
really, really unlikable.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.160
So you two really met before during
the workshop...

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:19.620
Even when I personally trained him,

00:15:19.883 --> 00:15:24.403
he looked completely distracted.
I didn't know if he was even listening.

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:28.000
But his technique and taste
weren't bad, surprisingly.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.210
It was so frustrating.

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:31.860
At that time,

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.660
I was fighting with Natsume-san,
so I couldn't focus on the training.

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:35.930
You...

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:40.820
I'm sorry...

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.420
But this time,

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:47.419
your work ability has been recognized,

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.710
and you've joined my workshop team.

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:53.090
That means I wasn't wrong about you, right?

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:58.850
I admit you have the potential to shine.

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.420
That's why I wanted to
talk to you properly this time.

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:05.080
Toma, what about you?

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:06.790
What are your plans for the future?

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.840
As a Romy makeup artist, I also want to...

00:16:09.865 --> 00:16:10.865
Do you mean...

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:13.380
you want to become a top makeup artist?

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.740
Don't make me laugh.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.000
You can't do it as you are now.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:23.510
It's absolutely impossible
for you to become the best.

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.350
You'll hit a wall sooner or later.

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:29.410
Then...

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:30.910
what should I do?

00:16:31.773 --> 00:16:32.880
Toma...

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.830
It seems you're serious
about becoming the best.

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:42.020
Alright, Toma.

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:43.900
Stay after the workshop,

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:45.549
and I'll train you.

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:46.580
Huh...

00:16:47.065 --> 00:16:48.915
Hey, what's with that expression?

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:49.990
Hey, Toma...

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.580
Is just the workshop not enough?

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:54.390
- After all, isn't the workshop for...
- Don't underestimate me.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:57.740
I'm incredibly busy.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.530
I even made time especially for you.

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:03.700
So?

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:04.730
Are you unwilling?

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.000
It's not that I'm unwilling...

00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:09.260
It's just that I already have plans.

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:11.250
What are you talking about, Toma?

00:17:11.576 --> 00:17:14.016
An opportunity like this is rare,
you need to take advantage.

00:17:25.013 --> 00:17:27.413
Is it really okay to take on
Emma's personal training too?

00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:29.130
Of course.

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.890
It's personal guidance
from a top makeup artist!

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:35.940
But... I was planning to cook dinner for
Natsume-san while the workshop was happening.

00:17:36.793 --> 00:17:37.810
Huh?

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:40.030
- Don't tell me your 'plans' refer to this?
- Yeah.

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:44.190
I thought I could have dinner ready for you
when you came home during the workshop.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.830
That kind of thing doesn't matter.

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:48.490
This is such a rare opportunity.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:49.560
Do your best.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:54.110
I really like it when
Natsume-san says 'Go for it'.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.240
It really makes me feel like I can do it.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.600
Then...

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:00.520
Do you want me to say it again?

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:01.850
Mm.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.240
Go for it.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:10.320
OK.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:14.940
Toma.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.400
Go for it.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:19.260
OK.

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:23.860
Huh...

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.190
Maybe I shouldn't meddle too much?

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:30.170
Hm?

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.790
The training with Emma-san.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.840
I think you should go.

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.960
But maybe... you might not want to do it.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.640
Because sometimes I jump
to conclusions too quickly.

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:39.780
Not at all.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:42.710
I think what Emma said makes a lot of sense.

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:45.280
And not many people correct me like that.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.560
I'm quite interested.

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:48.980
It's just that...

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:52.300
I said I'd cook dinner and wait
for Natsume-san to come home.

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:54.630
I just hate not being
able to keep my promises.

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:57.330
That's fine.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:18:59.750
Go and study well.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.040
Yes!

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:07.170
And then,

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.500
Emma's workshop began.

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:11.540
To improve your skills,

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.610
you need to increase your knowledge,

00:19:13.766 --> 00:19:15.466
and accumulate practical experience.

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:21.080
Today, I'd like you to do makeup
for the models for the in-house show.

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:23.240
Models have different skin tones,

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:25.350
and bone structures.

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:28.880
The kind of makeup artist who shows
how nervous they are just because

00:19:29.175 --> 00:19:33.257
it's your first time working with
someone, is a failure.

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:36.560
No matter what kind of
model is in front of you,

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:39.590
you must be able to
instantly plan their makeup.

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:42.230
Alright.

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:43.690
Allons-y.

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:44.890
OK.

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:51.810
Still the same Spartan training, huh?

00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:59.070
Nice to meet you.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.600
Toma.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.470
He's probably still doing his training.

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:23.070
Hello?

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:24.580
Natsume-san.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:26.820
I thought you should be
leaving the store by now.

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:28.090
Huh?

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.060
Are you secretly watching me somewhere?

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.210
No way.

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:35.260
I'm just on a break right now.

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:38.690
I just wanted to hear your voice.

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:41.020
I see.

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:44.470
What did you do today?

00:20:45.496 --> 00:20:49.706
It felt more like a real-life
situation than a workshop.

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:52.430
Now, I'm the only one left.

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:53.840
Huh?

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:55.990
The whole team's skill level is very high.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.430
I'm actually the least experienced one...

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.320
But for some reason...

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.280
You're happy?

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.240
Yes.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.330
Maybe I caught
Natsume-san's fever for working.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.540
As long as you're happy.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
That's true.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.400
Well then...

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:17.220
I should probably head back.

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:18.730
Oh.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.080
Go for it!

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:22.830
I really do love your encouragement.

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:24.560
Hey you!

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.500
But still, go for it.

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:28.150
Okay.

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:30.250
Mm.

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:38.350
Toma.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.720
Ah.

00:21:39.813 --> 00:21:41.373
Sorry, I'll head right back.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:43.550
I have something important to tell you.

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:01.820
You're so slow.

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:10.540
Toma.

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.100
Good work. How was
Emma's personal training...?

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.200
Natsume-san...

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:17.980
I love you.

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:23.170
So suddenly... what's wrong?

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:27.150
I just suddenly wanted to say it...

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:31.170
Mm...

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.060
What's wrong?

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:06.710
Can't sleep?

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:10.390
Did something happen during the workshop?

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:14.170
No...

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:17.000
I just want to be with Natsume-san

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:19.530
like this for a little longer.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.920
How should I put it?

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.900
This unusual sense of unease.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:30.580
Did something happen?

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:39.770
Natsume-san?

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:43.030
You...

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.000
look tired.

00:23:45.933 --> 00:23:47.953
Let me pamper you once in a while too.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:03.166
(Next Episode)
Emma-san, is she seriously seeing him as...

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:04.190
Emma.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.240
Toma.

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:08.149
So, what does Natsume think?

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:09.229
About Toma?

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:11.740
Natsume-san, can I
talk to you for a moment?
