Back then,

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.930
we didn't really know
each other's full names.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:48.990
We used nicknames.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.150
I remember there was one guy,

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:52.200
called Moneybag.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:53.930
He wore a watch on every trip.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:55.220
Later, we found out

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.570
that his watch was broken.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.170
The hands didn't move at all.

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.730
There was also one called Monkey.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:01.720

Li Yongqiang

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.210
was Hongyuan Freight Company's

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.830
Oh, you mean the boss?

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.350

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.880
How would I

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.050
know the boss?

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:18.830
I only know one big shot—

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.120
our fleet captain.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:21.530
Then when did you

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:23.390
leave Hongyuan Freight Company?

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.970
1996...

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.670
1997, I think.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.050
I didn't leave by choice.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:32.390
The fleet captain

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:33.460
told us one day

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:35.450
that the company went bust

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:36.880
and not to come back.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:37.630
He gave us

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:38.200
a month's wages

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.330
and told us to leave.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.540
Just like that, we were unemployed.

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:45.310
Do you know

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:46.220
why this freight company

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.220
got into trouble?

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:49.220
I don't know.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:51.820
Because your boss, Li Yongqiang,

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.880
was involved in illegal gold mining.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:07:59.030
Is that so?

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:01.220
This incident

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:02.590
was a pretty big deal

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.140
in Mazhi County back then.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.620

No.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:12.180
Those years were tough.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.270
Nothing went right.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.820
Besides, there's a lot

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:17.590
I can't remember clearly.

Take care, you two.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.460
He was a bit too talkative.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:33.220

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.820
he wasn't telling the truth?

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.100
But his story

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.330
basically lines up

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.500
with what we know.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.409
There are no obvious holes.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:41.549
That actually

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.030
makes it more suspicious.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:44.410
Exactly.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.010
When someone is lying,

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:47.890
to make it look like

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:49.420
they're telling the truth,

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.830
they tend to add

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.260
a lot of trivial details.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:53.850
Like

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:57.150
the Moneybag, the Monkey,

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.250
the broken watch, and so on.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:00.410
To flesh out the lie

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:01.770
as much as possible

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.380
and make it seem real.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:05.240
There's one more thing

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.300
I can't figure out.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.110
In the pocket of the skeleton's pants,

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:12.710
why was there a gasoline ration ticket?

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:14.840
Back then, Li Yongqiang was shot dead,

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.720
and Qima'er Gold Mine was closed.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:18.530
With Hongyuan Freight Company

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:19.290
serving as Li Yongqiang's

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:20.370
front organization,

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:21.050
why would his employees

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:22.290
have any reason

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:23.780
to kill Captain Duojie?

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:26.930
And even left evidence

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:28.810
on the Captain's body?

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:31.870
It makes no sense.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.360
It doesn't add up.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:39.990
Keep investigating.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.260
Find everyone we can at Hongyuan

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.420
and check them one by one.

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:48.360
Since Chenlong Coal Mine was merged,

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.000
Manager Wu has been in charge.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.580
There isn't enough
dust suppression equipment,

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:52.890
and he only cares about mining coal.

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:53.790
The dust is so thick

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:55.320
that it is like a sandstorm.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:56.860
The Chairman said

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.410
the city is focusing on rectification,

00:09:58.410 --> 00:09:59.670
so there might be spot checks anytime.

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:00.530
Mr. Meng,

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:01.500
should we ask Manager Bai

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.500
to lend us some staff and equipment?

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.650
Next time you come here,

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.070
clean yourself up first.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:11.780
Mr. Meng,

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.030
this door of yours

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:14.290
isn't of good quality.

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:14.890
I'll ask General Affairs

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:16.090
to replace it for you.

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:21.590
No need.

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:24.060
You can get off work now.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.500
Hello.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:32.620
They've investigated Wu Jiang?

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:35.750
What did they ask?

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:48.300
Here, let me.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:51.250
I'll go air out

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.440
Uncle's blanket.

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:53.710
Zhacuo

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:55.720
really doesn't know
how to take care of others.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.520
Don't bother.

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:58.240
It's getting dark soon.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:59.800
I'll remind Zhacuo later.

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:07.410
Has Shao gone back
to the provincial capital?

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:08.620
How would I know?

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:10.700
Actually, Shao

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.230
has always cared about you.

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:14.750
You don't need to say that.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.820
I'll go air out the blanket.

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:21.480
Bai.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:27.690
Is this magazine still in print?

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:28.710
My child likes it,

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:30.440
so I've kept the subscription.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.890
Your child must be in the eighth grade,
right?

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:33.820
How are his studies?

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:34.700
Much better than mine.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:35.900
Especially English.

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:40.740
He'll transfer to Chengdu next semester.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.730
The educational resources
are better there.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.460
I'm going to Chengdu, too.

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:48.570
I'm leaving soon.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.360
I'm giving the supermarket
to my brother-in-law.

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:56.120
The money to open it

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:58.220
came from my father-in-law anyway.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:12.640
I'm sorry.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:15.200
I'm being a deserter again.

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.030
You don't need to say that.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.550
Roads are better curved,
and bows better bent.

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.170
Words are better straight,
and arrows better sent.

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:24.740
It's okay.

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:25.790
That's the truth.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:28.610
Back in the Uninhabited Zone,

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.000
the environment was so harsh.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:34.740
That's why you got sick.

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.030
Going to a place with a lower altitude

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:38.360
is the right thing to do.

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:41.780
If you told me at any time

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.200
that you wanted to leave,

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.400
I could understand.

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.180
But why must it be today?

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:50.650
Why now?

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.230
Just when the remains have been found?

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:55.130
But why did those remains

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:56.750
appear there?

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:57.550
What exactly did the Captain

00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:58.740
go through back then?

00:12:58.740 --> 00:12:59.750
Who was behind it?

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:00.890
None of these things

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:02.340
have been cleared up yet.

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:04.330
Because

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.960
the remains have been found,

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:07.390
I feel like I can finally

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:08.300
leave.

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:10.440
For years, it felt like a hand

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.210
was tightly

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.300
gripping my heart.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:13.720
Every day I stayed in Mazhi,

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.910
I felt like that.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.290
Do you understand?

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:27.510
I know.

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.200
You had heart surgery.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.260
When I first got out of prison,

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:40.810
I couldn't find a job.

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:45.070
I often couldn't sleep at night.

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.050
When I finally did,

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:48.780
I'd have nightmares.

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:50.420
I dreamt of Qima'er Gold Mine.

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.020
There was blood everywhere.

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:54.260
I kept thinking, if only

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:55.920
I hadn't returned to the team,

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:57.720
then none of this

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.920
would have happened.

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:01.540
But I always thought of

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:02.470
Captain Duojie.

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:06.800
I felt like he was watching me.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:13.890
It's been 17 years.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.120
I finally found the Captain.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:16.910
I feel like I can finally

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:18.080
find some closure.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:21.650
I used to always want

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:22.910
a permanent position.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:24.250
Then I went to prison.

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:25.910
So a permanent position

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:27.640
is out of the question for me now.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.360
Now I just want to survive.

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:32.100
At least watch my child grow up

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.100
and go to college.

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:46.680
Uncle Riga.

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:48.840
I'll come visit you again.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.900
Be careful in the mountains.

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:00.780
Over the years,

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:03.230
you've offended too many people.

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:07.390
There's a 2 million bounty on your head.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.040
Take care of yourself.

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:32.720
Okay.

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:39.690
Sangba.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.970
I found this while cleaning the basement.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.770
I'm returning it to you.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:52.930
You still haven't returned

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:53.840
that copy of "Light Weapons"

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.040
you borrowed from me.

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:58.060
I haven't finished reading it yet.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.260
I want it now.

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.470
Haven't you finished reading yet?

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:13.230
Mom said,

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.160
"If a pillar in the temple breaks,

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:18.190
one person alone can't fix it.

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:20.230
Everyone must offer support

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:21.040
to fix it."

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:23.590
Bai, what do you think

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:25.280
people live for?

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:39.070
[Light Weapons]

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.220
Actually,

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:44.240
I've never regretted

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.070
coming back.

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:46.960
Really.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:52.390
I know.

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:02.220
Go.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:28.970
I'll head back now.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:30.330
Wait.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.790
In the last couple of days,

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:34.370
what have you police

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:35.280
found out?

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:38.460
Well...

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:41.060
We're still investigating.

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.740
Does that Wu Jiang,
who came to cause trouble,

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:45.590
have something to do

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:46.720
with this incident?

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.640
I heard you guys are investigating him.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.000
You, you...

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.300
Who told you that?

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:56.790
The wind on the grassland told me.

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:01.700
I see.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:03.110
Do you go to that karaoke bar

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:04.180
a lot?

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.900
The owner has a big mouth.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:09.940
Bai,

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:10.890
we all

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.090
go there often.

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:12.840
Quite often.

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:14.590
What have you found?

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:15.180
Tell us.

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:16.960
Regarding the investigation details,

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:17.540
I can't

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:18.640
tell you anything.

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:20.080
Bai,

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:20.530
why do you treat us

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:21.330
as outsiders?

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:23.270
It's not about
being insiders or outsiders.

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:24.550
The police have rules.

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:25.420
Rules, rules.

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:25.830
Cases aren't solved

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:26.810
by following the rules.

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:28.550
An organization must have discipline.

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:29.240
Han,

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:30.950
go find a job.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.810
Meet more people,

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.250
read between the lines,

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:35.620
and socialize a bit.

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:38.950
I'm not arguing with you about this.

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:40.400
Shao, go start the car.

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:41.390
Did I argue? Did I?

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:41.760
No, no.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:42.540
Did I?

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:47.660
Drive safely.

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:56.070
What did she mean?

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:57.850
We were just talking nicely,

00:18:57.850 --> 00:18:59.140
and now, a few days later,

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:00.940
she's creating division again.

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:02.750
Couldn't you understand

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:03.940
what she meant?

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:07.250
She didn't say anything.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:08.810
But she also didn't tell us

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:10.020
to do nothing.

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:12.210
What can we do?

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.790
Help find clues.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:17.760
Is that what Bai meant?

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:25.720
I think that's what she meant.

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:30.340
Liu Haoyu, right?

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.030
You used to work

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:32.170
at Mazhi Hongyuan Freight Company,

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:32.810
right?

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:34.200
Here.

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:34.720
Thanks.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.450
These people on the list—

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.080
have you seen them recently?

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.400
I know most of them.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.640
I haven't seen this one in a long time.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.520
Maybe it's been 2 months.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.240
Two months?

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:46.740
Yes, yes.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:47.450
Two months.

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:04.010
Sir.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:05.920
Hello.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.900
We are
from the Municipal Public Security Bureau.

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:08.480
We'd like

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.700
to ask you something.

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:10.310
Okay.

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:12.420
Is your name Li Haiyuan?

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:13.140
Yes, yes.

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:14.450
You used to work

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:15.630
at Mazhi Hongyuan Freight Company?

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:15.930
Yes.

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:17.600
That was many years ago.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.620
Take a look at this file first.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:37.360
Is Sangba

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:39.130
getting used to Chengdu?

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.020
He's not very loyal.

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:42.280
He just left like that.

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:44.290
He's drunk on oxygen,

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:46.750
saying he's sleepy all the time.

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:49.400
Li,

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:50.640
how did you let the police

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:51.570
get on your tail?

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:53.400
What do you mean by that?

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.750
They are investigating a case,

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:56.480
and traced it to my old company.

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:58.770
When I was young,

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:00.160
I worked there as a driver.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.270
That was years ago.

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:04.070
Didn't you drive trucks in Mazhi before?

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.570
Yes.

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:06.000
Hongyuan Freight.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.140
I've heard of it. Big company.

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:09.680
Lots of people.

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:11.270
I don't know

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:12.350
what they are looking for.

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:13.790
They even asked me to recall,

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:14.280
well,

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:15.350
the missing page,

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:16.390
and who was on it.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:17.880
Seriously?

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:19.900
Who could remember that?

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:49.030
What's wrong?

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:50.500
I should be asking you that.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:51.760
What's wrong with you?

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.020
About the middle school,

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.400
I've asked around for you.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.680
Experimental Middle School
and No. 2 Middle School

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:58.880
are both pretty good.

00:21:58.940 --> 00:21:59.680
Experimental Middle School

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:00.450
focuses more

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.520
on students'

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:02.110
independence.

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:03.110
They value students'

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:04.310
holistic education.

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:05.500
No. 2 Middle School

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:06.900
is relatively stricter.

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:07.300
But

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:08.610
it depends on your child.

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:09.460
I think both of them

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:09.910
are fine.

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:10.370
Thanks.

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:29.270
Get out!

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:36.110
I heard this Bai Ju

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:37.160
was transferred from

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.820
the Mazhi County Public Security Bureau.

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:39.950
What did she ask you?

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.210
What else could she ask?

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:46.030
Asked about my routes.

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:48.150
Asked what cargo I hauled.

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:49.640
Asked if I knew Duojie.

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.180
Anyway, I just said

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:54.840
what the boss taught me to say.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.780
I didn't tell the whole truth,

00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:58.710
but I couldn't tell all the lies.

00:22:58.930 --> 00:22:59.830
I mixed truth with lies

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:01.160
and ran them in circles.

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:04.430
Don't talk too much to the police.

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.290
If they find you once,

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:08.550
they can find you a second time.

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:10.830
Mr. Meng,

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.390
are you afraid I have a loose tongue,

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.220
or are you afraid

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:15.140
I'll drag you down with me?

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:16.310
I'm reminding you.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.950
If you're smart,

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:20.140
you should know

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:22.160
that right now,

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.540
we need to stand together,

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.730
not fight amongst ourselves.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.750
Since it's your treat today,

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.100
I'll have to open another bottle.

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:49.070
Be careful.

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.180
Don't drink too much and mess things up.

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.500
Mr. Meng, have you finished?

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:04.550
Shen.

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:06.470
Mr. Meng,

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:07.380
what's up?

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.410
If you want to be with Wu Jiang
for the long run,

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:15.450
talk some sense into him.

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:17.040
Success isn't just about the present,

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:17.660
right?

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:22.660
Thank you, Mr. Meng. I'll tell him.

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:24.910
You're more sensible than he is.

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:26.740
Goodbye, Mr. Meng.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:42.400
Hello, Officer Bai.

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:44.720
You still owe me a meal.

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:49.900
Kung Pao Chicken.

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:51.290
That's all the dishes.

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:52.300
We also ordered a bottle of wine.

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:53.430
Please bring it out.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:57.550
We have fresh squeezed

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:58.440
corn juice,

00:24:58.550 --> 00:24:59.150
yam juice,

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:00.190
and pumpkin juice.

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:01.060
Take your pick.

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:03.450
No need. Just bring the wine.

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:06.780
Didn't you drive here?

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:07.420
Where do you get

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:08.590
so many questions?

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:12.450
Alright, alright.

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:13.650
We'll just drink tea.

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:14.840
Okay, tea is good.

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:26.620
That's it.

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:29.810
Enjoy your meal.

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:45.850
What's wrong?

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:47.940
We don't need you here anymore.

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:48.950
You can leave now.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.110
Our restaurant has a rule.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:52.140
In this room,

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.530
I have to stay and serve.

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:56.670
We didn't want to sit in this room.

00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:58.250
You insisted we

00:25:58.250 --> 00:25:59.070
sit in such a big room.

00:25:59.070 --> 00:25:59.940
Ju, since you're here...

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:00.400
Get out.

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:05.020
Take your time eating.

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:06.630
Call me if you need anything.

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.910
Let's eat.

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:14.800
Your brother is quite protective of you.

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:16.170
If I had known,

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:17.880
I would have picked a different place.

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:18.940
This place is fine.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.890
It's convenient for chatting.

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:22.910
Go ahead.

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:24.940
What do you want to see me about?

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:26.810
So direct.

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:27.950
Are you here

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:29.510
to continue the blind date?

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:33.920
I heard

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:35.750
you questioned Wu Jiang.

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:36.570
News of this

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:38.160
has spread through the company.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.760
Mr. Feng is quite concerned.

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:40.850
After all,

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:42.630
Wu Jiang is Xinhai's Vice President.

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:44.230
If something happens to him,

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:46.270
it won't look good for the company.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.440
Can you reveal

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:49.130
what exactly he...

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:49.890
Mr. Meng.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.660
For a company as big as Xinhai,

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:53.050
before you hire someone,

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:54.850
don't you do background checks?

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:58.040
Of course we do background checks.

00:26:58.510 --> 00:26:59.240
However,

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:00.460
people

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:01.570
always have a past.

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:03.490
What we can find

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:04.260
isn't much.

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:05.980
Then how did he

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.970
get into Xinhai in the first place?

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:10.440
Mr. Feng hired him.

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:12.090
I don't know the details.

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:13.310
But over the years,

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:14.640
he's done well at Xinhai

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:16.710
and hasn't caused any trouble.

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:19.530
Then regarding Wu Jiang's background,

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:20.660
how much do you know?

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:22.430
For example,

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.540
the time

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:24.380
when he worked

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.030
at Mazhi Hongyuan Freight Company.

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:27.750
Hongyuan Freight?

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.250
I don't know.

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:31.460
I know

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:33.150
he worked in freight early on.

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:34.940
What kind of goods did he transport?

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:36.340
Who did he interact with most?

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:38.440
Did you hear him mention these things?

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.150
I really don't know about that.

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:40.640
After all, that was

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.300
before he joined the company.

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:44.510
If you want to know,

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:45.550
I can actually

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:47.280
ask around indirectly for you.

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:52.330
Does this company

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:54.260
have anything to do with your work?

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:57.290
Do you realize just now

00:27:57.290 --> 00:27:59.490
how many times you said you didn't know?

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:07.820
We're at a restaurant,

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:09.920
not a police station.

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:11.880
Why is it every time we chat,

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.010
it feels like I'm being interrogated?

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:15.770
You feel that way?

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:18.900
Then maybe,

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:20.630
you have a guilty conscience.

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:27.660
It's just your professional habit.

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:35.330
Sorry, I have to take this.

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:37.950
Hello?

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:39.050
Mom.

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:40.750
When are you coming back?

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:42.110
I have something to tell you.

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:42.960
It's huge.

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:43.900
I know.

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:44.920
You got into a fight at school today,

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:45.840
didn't you?

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.610
I'll deal with you when I get back.

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:49.240
Don't listen to the teacher.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.640
He pulled my braid first.

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:52.330
Shao Zhuling,

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:53.990
how many times have I told you?

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.610
No matter what conflict

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:56.610
you have with your classmates,

00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:57.940
you can't get physical.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.750
You're half a head taller than that boy.

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:00.710
One push from you, and he goes flying.

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:01.830
Do you know your own strength?

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:03.550
I know.

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:04.380
If he hadn't fallen,

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:05.800
you would have kicked him, right?

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.200
The moves I taught you

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:08.380
are for defending against bad guys.

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:08.940
How could you use them

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:10.000
on your classmate?

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:12.440
What if you seriously

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:13.170
injured him?

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.480
I wouldn't.

00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:16.410
If you fight again,

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:17.160
I'll drive the police car over

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.020
and arrest you.

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:18.480
You...

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:20.190
We'll talk when I get back.

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:22.380
Sorry about that.

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:23.810
My kid is a handful.

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:25.500
It's fine.

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:28.070
I feel a bit more balanced now.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.140
It's like you're interrogating

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:33.250
everyone.

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:36.550
I've been forced into this.

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:37.810
You heard that just now.

00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:38.850
It's so worrying.

00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:41.850
Having a child at home

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:42.640
is lively.

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:44.910
Stop with the snide remarks.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.140
If it's good to have kids,

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:47.870
then why don't you get married?

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:50.270
Then why did you get divorced?

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:51.790
Don't change the subject.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:53.570
Fine.

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:57.320
Officer Bai.

00:29:58.330 --> 00:29:59.400
I'm not married

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:00.370
because

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:02.110
I haven't met the right person.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:03.870
After all, this kind of thing

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:05.000
depends on fate,

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:05.770
right?

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:22.360
What are you doing here?

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:23.360
You went to eat?

00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:25.830
Or should I starve?

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.180
With whom?

00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:28.670
No one.

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:30.660
No one?

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:32.150
I heard

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:33.500
it wasn't just "no one."

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:36.900
Bai Ji, that turncoat.

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.400
Don't blame Bai Ji.

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:41.610
We're worried about you.

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:42.590
You should

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:43.850
worry about yourself.

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:46.430
That man is Meng Yaohui,

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:48.330
General Manager of Xinhai.

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:49.610
He's my blind date.

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:54.850
What are you laughing at?

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:57.640
Then... I'm relieved.

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:00.220
Shao Yunfei.

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.710
Did you not hear me?

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:04.570
I just said

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:06.860
that was my blind date.

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:08.610
My mom set us up.

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:10.700
I... I heard you.

00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:12.460
You have a blind date.

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.060
But over the years,

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.360
you've been on plenty.

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:18.700
You scared them off immediately.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.480
In Tianduo, there are so many

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.120
older single men,

00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:24.280
and you've roasted almost all of them.

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:26.150
And which one has worked out?

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:28.570
This isn't our

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:29.770
first meal together.

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:39.530
Are you serious?

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:43.650
No.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.050
We have a work connection.

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:50.750
How many times have you met?

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:51.930
You are so annoying.

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:52.980
It's none of your business.

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:54.270
It has nothing to do with you.

00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:55.400
Bai Ju, listen to me.

00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:57.260
For some interactions,

00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:59.190
you might think they mean nothing.

00:31:59.330 --> 00:31:59.580
But

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:01.110
he might not think so.

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:04.750
Shao Yunfei.

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:05.850
After all these years,

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:07.050
you haven't changed.

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:08.720
Not everyone

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.480
is like you,

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:11.630
hunting for romance at work.

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.350
Hunting for romance?

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:15.430
That sounds terrible.

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:16.370
How can you compare him

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:17.310
to us?

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:19.310
We went through so much back then.

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:20.410
We came together

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:20.960
naturally.

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.420
I wasn't talking about us.

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:28.410
I was talking about...

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:30.030
that lady friend of yours.

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:31.110
What's her name?

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:32.370
Xiaodong,

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.900
Xiaoxi, or whatever.

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:35.250
Xi?

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.220
You mean Xiaodong?

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:38.890
Whatever.

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:39.400
Well.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:40.360
You...

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:41.380
Y-You...

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.660
Explain what you mean.

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:43.550
Don't you dare

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:44.480
pin this on me.

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:45.770
Shao Yunfei,

00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:46.770
stop pretending.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.140
I saw it all.

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:49.700
She texted you in the middle of the night,

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:50.360
calling you

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:52.660
Handsome Shao or something.

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:55.390
You really think you're a hunk?

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:56.920
That is a nickname

00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:57.750
my colleagues gave me.

00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:59.220
Everyone calls me that.

00:32:59.250 --> 00:32:59.740
Whatever.

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:00.570
It's been years.

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:01.160
Explain it

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.160
however you want.

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:03.530
Besides, Xiaodong

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:04.880
was my junior at school.

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:05.870
She was assigned to our newspaper office,

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:07.240
so I had to mentor her.

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:09.220
And she's already married.

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.040
They were college sweethearts.

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:12.590
Her husband was my junior too.

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:14.030
We were all close friends.

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:15.290
Why are you twisting it like this?

00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:17.480
Fine, you were close.

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:19.890
Go live with the two of them then.

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:21.910
What do you mean by living with them?

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:22.370
You...

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.980
It's been 4 years.

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:25.590
Why bring this up now?

00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:26.410
Wait a minute.

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:30.040
D-Did you divorce me

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:31.180
because of this?

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:33.270
Our divorce

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:34.720
wasn't about one thing.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:35.980
Nor did it happen

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:37.220
overnight.

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:37.830
If I had known

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:38.480
it was because of this,

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.850
I would never have agreed

00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:40.680
to the divorce.

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:41.660
You know perfectly well

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:43.010
why I divorced you.

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:43.880
Here we go again.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:44.610
What did I do?

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:48.660
All these years,

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.330
you've never told me

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:52.200
what's on your mind.

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:54.130
You always make decisions,

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:55.130
and I just follow.

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:55.830
Bai Ju.

00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.410
I care about you.

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:00.600
I'm worried about you.

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:02.810
Don't you understand?

00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:03.810
I still want to...

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:04.500
I'm sorry.

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:09.650
Since the Mountain Patrol was disbanded,

00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:10.580
all these years,

00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:14.830
I haven't had a good night's sleep.

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:17.010
Work.

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:18.570
Life.

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:20.190
Our child.

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.290
I can't handle any of them well.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.510
But I'm trying hard

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:27.810
to be a good mother.

00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:30.000
I'm doing my best

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:31.230
to be good to Zhuling.

00:34:33.659 --> 00:34:35.389
I know you care about the child.

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:36.880
Thank you.

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.400
But it's been 4 years.

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:41.920
We're used to it by now.

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:44.400
I decided to separate.

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:47.389
And I don't regret it.

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:51.940
I held you back,

00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:52.699
Shao Yunfei.

00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:57.940
Have I

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:00.940
made myself clear?

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:20.470
Where are you going?

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.770
I rented a place up there.

00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:27.510
Who are you kidding?

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:29.080
Seriously.

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:31.740
I've been transferred back.

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:38.540
You think you can go

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:39.600
wherever you want?

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:41.580
I just reported your case

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:42.460
to the leadership.

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:45.260
They'll discuss it at the next meeting,
but you...

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:46.830
T-Thank you, Chief Editor.

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:49.020
But after thinking it over,

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:49.920
I still feel

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:53.030
I'm not cut out to be a leader.

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:54.570
I'm just an errand boy.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:56.980
The Tianduo press station

00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:57.710
is short-handed, isn't it?

00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:59.280
I'd be a perfect fit there.

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:01.260
I think you being here

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:02.190
is a perfect fit.

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:03.360
You can take my seat.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.060
You lead me.

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:05.870
And I'll listen to you, alright?

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:15.340
Speak up. Why exactly?

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:20.840
Well...

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:25.050
How do I put this? As for me,

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:26.960
I have a career now,

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.170
but my family is falling apart.

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:30.900
You know about

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:31.510
my situation in Tianduo.

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:32.660
I think your career

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:34.150
is about to fall apart too.

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:35.030
Yes.

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:36.400
Chief Editor,

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.980
I don't care about the pay.

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:38.650
As for housing,

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:39.730
I can solve that myself.

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:40.760
No need for reimbursement.

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:42.050
Business trips are no problem either.

00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:43.820
As long as I can be stationed in Tianduo,

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:44.750
anything works.

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:51.980
Since you're silent,

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:53.820
I'll take that as a yes.

00:36:58.070 --> 00:36:59.110
Get out!

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.530
It's not that we won't let you in.

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:08.400
The truck broke down here.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.030
Right now, immediately,

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:10.490
call your person in charge

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.480
to deal with this situation.

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.810
The truck broke down...

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:17.580
Section Chief Guo, what brings you here?

00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:18.980
You didn't give us a heads-up.

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:20.650
I could've arranged someone
to pick you up.

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:21.340
Mr. Wu.

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:23.380
We're here
to inspect the rectification progress.

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:24.990
Why did you

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:26.760
block the road with a big truck?

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:28.210
Your visit today

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:29.410
is really bad timing.

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:31.020
Our dust removal equipment's

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:32.410
transport truck broke down.

00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:33.800
Look, I rushed back here

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:35.180
just

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:36.470
to handle this matter.

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:39.500
Xinhai,

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:41.280
a company of your size,

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:42.490
with so many mines,

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:44.780
can't even mobilize a tow truck?

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.110
No, no.

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:47.550
Inside,

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:49.330
they're stabilizing the slopes.

00:37:49.330 --> 00:37:50.730
It's not safe to drive in.

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:52.670
If there's a collapse,

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:54.990
who will take responsibility?

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:01.460
Alright.

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.100
We'll walk in then.

00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:04.900
Let's go.

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:06.250
Okay, okay.

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:11.700
I need to take this first.

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:12.130
Okay.

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:15.920
Hello?

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:17.370
Director Huang.

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:25.550
Okay.

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:27.110
Okay.

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:28.430
I understand.

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:29.640
No problem.

00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:41.120
Section Chief Guo.

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:42.620
Let's go in.

00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:45.980
Director Huang from the Coal Bureau

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:46.840
said your current

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:47.480
rectification tasks

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:48.690
are indeed tough,

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.580
so he wants to give you ample time.

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:52.670
In the future,
we will conduct joint inspections

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:53.610
with the Coal Bureau

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:54.940
and follow up in stages.

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:56.170
No problem.

00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:57.920
We will definitely cooperate.

00:38:58.860 --> 00:38:59.840
I'll see you out.

00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:01.580
No need.

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:02.480
We know the way.

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:03.760
We'll walk ourselves.

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:05.500
Okay.

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:07.680
Goodbye!

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:09.190
Take care!

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:17.820
Mr. Wu.

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:19.940
They'll come back, won't they?

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:20.740
Let them come.

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:23.300
We'll deal with whatever comes our way.

00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:25.210
For agencies
like the Environmental Protection Bureau,

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:27.470
I have ways to handle them if they return.

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:30.420
They're just
making trouble out of nothing.

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:35.480
Captain Bai, here to supervise?

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:36.540
Why don't you go in?

00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:37.530
Director Xia.

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:38.960
It's lunch time, isn't it?

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.760
I brought you some comfort food.

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:42.070
Our section's

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:43.530
lunches these past few days

00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:45.000
have basically been covered by you.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.520
I'd cover 3 meals a day.

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:47.630
I'm counting on you guys

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:48.630
to give me clues.

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:50.000
Here.

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:50.780
No, no.

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:53.950
I feel bad eating this.

00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:57.500
Are the results out?

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:05.670
Nothing has been found.

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:08.440
I just came back from the Chief's office.

00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:11.610
Not detected.

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:15.090
Synthetic fibers

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:15.670
interfere with DNA

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:17.110
to some extent.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.430
Plus, the clothes

00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:19.490
are too old.

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:20.940
The amount of DNA

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:22.260
is below the testing method's

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:23.090
sensitivity.

00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.900
In the end,

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:25.760
extraction failed.

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:30.250
The Chief has informed Tashi,

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:31.490
and he understands.

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:43.020
So,

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:45.070
from your professional perspective,

00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:46.260
are there other ways

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:46.890
to verify

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:48.560
the identity of the skeleton?

00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:50.070
Not at the moment.

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:53.920
If we can't verify it,

00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:56.780
it'll become a cold case again.

00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:58.140
It's too early

00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:59.360
to say that.

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:00.710
We're also cross-referencing

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:02.170
with the DNA database.

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:04.420
I know

00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:05.230
this case

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:06.420
means a lot to you.

00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:08.580
Just be patient.

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:11.640
I just want a definite answer.

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:13.440
Whether it's Duojie or not.

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:14.080
Xia.

00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:14.570
Come in.

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:16.320
The ballistics results are in.

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:18.590
Ballistics show

00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:19.280
the bullet found

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:20.440
at the skeleton site

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:21.900
and bullet 027

00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:23.440
that injured someone at Qima'er Gold Mine

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:24.700
came from the same gun.

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:26.420
Qima'er Gold Mine?

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:27.460
Yes.

00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:28.680
I've compared them.

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:29.820
The marks match.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:30.710
It's definitely

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:31.770
a Type 54 pistol.

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:36.980
It means this gun

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:39.730
was used by someone

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:42.840
at Qima'er Gold Mine.

00:41:58.140 --> 00:41:58.670
So, you're here

00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:59.730
to interrogate us.

00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:02.000
Are we suspects?

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:05.710
That's a bit harsh.

00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:07.370
We're all on the same team.

00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:09.020
Am I wrong?

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:10.440
When she needs us,

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:11.440
we're teammates.

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:12.190
When she doesn't,

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:13.320
we become outsiders

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:14.360
kept in the dark.

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:15.500
Now we've become

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:16.320
suspects.

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.940
Getting burned a little is all right.

00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:26.770
It only burned your hand,

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:28.110
not your mouth.

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:30.960
We just bicker,

00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:33.810
but our hearts are still together.

00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:37.940
Bai, go ahead and ask.

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.450
We'll cooperate.

00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:45.580
In the Qima'er Gold Mine raid,

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:47.020
you both took part.

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:47.890
I hope

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:48.550
you can recall

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:49.880
the situation back then.

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:51.420
Especially those gunmen.

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:52.480
Their

00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:53.380
looks,

00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:54.820
builds,

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:56.190
or

00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:57.430
any other features.

00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:59.290
The more details, the better.

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:04.010
It was so chaotic back then.

00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:05.830
Bullets

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:07.260
were flying everywhere.

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:09.030
Who had time to observe details?
