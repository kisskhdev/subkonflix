[The Blood of Youth: Quest of Heroic Hearts]

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.980
[Episode 6]

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.720
My friend,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.920
what is this place?

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.640
Hush, miss.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.000
If the superintendent hears us,

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.200
we'll be beaten up.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.080
Exactly.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.440
You speak like that?

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.400
I am not a miss.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.560
I'm a man.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.000
You must be new here.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.680
While we

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
have the body of a man,

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.480
we're actually

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.200
women.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.440
Don't say such outrageous things

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.960
or you might get us into trouble.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.080
You took the Gender Transformation Pill?

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.680
Yes.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.040
It won't turn a man into a woman.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.400
It just makes you very weak,

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.040
like you're a woman

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.360
who is being starved.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.960
Every month, the poison will act up

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.040
for a few days,

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.680
giving us an excruciating

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.560
abdominal pain.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.640
Lie down now.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.800
You have to work later.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.520
That's right.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.280
People in this chamber

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.920
are chefs.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.600
When we wake up,

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.920
we must chop wood, gather fruits,

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.680
and feed the animals.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.560
If

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.000
we didn't boil the water for the Red Maiden in time,

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.040
we...

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.240
We'll be caned!

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.600
Stop it!

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.760
Wait.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.400
You just accept this fate?

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.240
Listen.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.800
Let's devise a plan.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.240
I'll bring you with me.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.960
Don't say those things.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.760
If they think we're still longing

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.760
for the wonderful world outside,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.440
then

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.240
we

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.280
will be caged and drowned.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.320
I can't deal with your nonsense.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.920
Hush!

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.920
Hurry up!

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.360
To live in Qingyin Parlor,

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.600
you must make use of your hands.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.000
Why do I even keep you here?

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.160
You can't even do your work properly.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.960
Don't even think about slacking off.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.280
You're lucky that we're feeding

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.520
you here.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.680
You there.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.800
Wipe off the water already.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.760
When will the Red Maiden

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.040
give us a man?

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.600
Such favor will never befall us.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.960
The security is tight. How can I escape?

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.200
Is the woman in this portrait

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.520
the Divine Maiden they're talking about?

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.480
Who is the little girl?

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.480
Who is the one who saved me?

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.880
Are you okay?

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.440
I feel

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:04.880
weak.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.280
And I have a headache.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:07.960
My strength is completely drained.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.920
Perhaps it's because of the liquor?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.720
No way.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.120
I

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.200
feel energetic

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.240
and robust.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.120
Of course.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.840
The liquor

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.040
contains the Gender Transformation Pill.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.880
If a woman drinks it,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
she'll feel revitalized.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.560
If a man drinks it,

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.720
he'll be greatly weakened.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.160
You think you could fool me?

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.040
The moment you set foot in here,

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.080
I knew you were a man right away.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.760
Capture this lowly being.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.280
Send him to the courtyard.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.560
Impossible.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.080
There's no way she's a man.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.320
How can it be?

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.400
You're a woman.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.720
Yet you worked with a man to deceive me.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.840
I didn't know.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.120
He lied to me as well.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.680
I didn't know he was a man.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.080
I trust you for now.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.880
But decide for yourself

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.280
if you want

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.760
to stay in this parlor or not.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:27.560
Go inside.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.280
I didn't say anything.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:30.880
Nothing.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.360
Weigui.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.480
I didn't say anything.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.000
You've been captured as well.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.560
Who is she?

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.440
A newcomer.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:40.720
How do you feel?

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:43.800
I feel

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:44.920
weak.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.240
I have no strength left.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.160
Did you take the Gender Transformation Pill as well?

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.000
We're done for.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.640
We're done for.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.320
You can't

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.600
be my sidekick anymore.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.720
Only side chick.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:03.880
Oh.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.920
Wasn't Hua Xiaohua with you?

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:06.800
Where is she?

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:27.880
Oh, no!

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:28.720
Oh, no!

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.120
The Divine Maiden Shrine is on fire.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:30.680
What?

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.480
All Red Maidens must head to the shrine to put out the fire now.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.560
Let's go.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.080
Let's go.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.200
Quick.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.000
Hua Xiaohua.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.080
You've been captured as well?

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.920
No, I'm here to save you.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:47.800
How did you get in?

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.920
I burned their Divine Maiden portrait.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:51.720
She...

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.120
She burned the Divine Maiden portrait.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.320
She's so mean!

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.200
Cage her and drown her.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.840
I also found the Skysplitter fragment.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:59.680
The Skysplitter fragment?

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:07.880
Then what are we waiting for?

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:08.640
Let's run.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.040
Let's go.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:10.920
Come.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:16.720
Stop.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.880
I can't walk further.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.280
Let's run.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:22.880
Otherwise, she'll find out.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.000
- We won't be able to escape. - I can't.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:24.760
I can't.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:25.960
I'm

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.280
too weak now.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:28.560
Me too.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.240
Xiaohua, you should run first.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:31.080
Otherwise,

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.000
none of us will be able to escape.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.080
None of you will leave this place.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.760
You burned the Divine Maiden portrait

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.200
and stole the Skysplitter fragment.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.160
Meet your demise!

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.120
Stop!

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.200
Divine Maiden!

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.760
Greetings, Divine Maiden.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.160
Stand up.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.320
I do not need your respect.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.840
Oh, the almighty Divine Maiden.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.120
The Sun and the Moon bear witness

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.000
to the Red Maidens' loyalty.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:23.960
We will follow you forever.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.400
Should we betray you,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:26.800
we'll be condemned to eternal death.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.600
Should we betray you,

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:29.920
we'll be condemned to eternal death.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:30.600
Enough.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.320
I saved all of you

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.880
so that you can live a good life here.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.440
Instead, you turned this place into a living hell.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.920
You delivered us from misery.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.800
So we want to be like you

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.680
and deliver all women

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.640
from the confinement of men.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.560
Are you saving womankind?

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.800
What difference is there

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.920
between you and the men you hate the most?

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.040
In Qingyin Parlor,

00:10:58.760 --> 00:10:59.680
you are the men.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.120
You bully because you are strong

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.960
and empowered.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.040
You grow arrogant because of your privilege,

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.640
abusing others and thinking that's your right.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.040
Is this what you want?

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.520
How ridiculous.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.400
If I knew this would happen,

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.800
why should I save you back then?

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.080
Divine Maiden.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.200
We do repent.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.360
You have the Skysplitter fragment?

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:33.440
Yes.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.160
We chanced upon

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.400
the fragment previously.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:38.600
But

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.480
they snatched it away.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.640
Everyone wants the Skysplitter fragment.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.920
What is their reason for going after

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.520
the fragment?

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:11.560
Forget it.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.040
I will take away the fragment.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.440
Release everyone here.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.240
Do not stay here anymore.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:39.440
Xiaohua.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.120
Xiaohua.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:44.200
Xiaohua.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:45.800
Xiaohua.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:54.800
How do you feel?

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.440
I can feel

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.000
my strong pulse.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.160
I don't feel cold.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.440
The Peach Wine

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.360
is a wonderful nourishment.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.040
My skin is better too.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.280
I wonder if she has more in stock.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.800
I can take several bottles of them with me

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.920
to study their medicinal value.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:14.960
No, thanks.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.520
I won't even

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.360
be able to sleep well knowing those things are around me.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:19.920
However,

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.800
I sense that my inner force

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.240
has returned.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.800
The Divine Maiden must have

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:28.960
cured my ailment.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.280
She's so sweet.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.880
Why are you so happy, Lei?

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:40.520
Ye.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.360
What brought you here?

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:44.680
I heard something major

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:45.920
happened in Qingyin Parlor yesterday.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.440
I thought you must have been involved in it

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:48.280
so I came.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.800
But it seems like

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.280
everyone has left.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.720
Why are you dressed like this?

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.120
It's a long story.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.960
We had quite a perilous journey.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.720
We disguised ourselves,

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.560
got beaten up,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:07.640
and was

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.040
poisoned.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.400
Did you find the Skysplitter fragment then?

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:13.680
I did.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.080
But I lost it.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:16.480
I guess

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.680
the Red Maidens took it away.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:23.560
Wei...

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.360
Where's Weigui?

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:26.600
Right.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.000
Where's Weigui?

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.000
Weigui!

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.200
- Weigui. - Weigui.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:36.440
Weigui!

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:37.960
Weigui!

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:39.680
Weigui!

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:41.880
Weigui!

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:43.280
Weigui!

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:46.120
Weigui!

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:47.560
Weigui!

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:52.800
Weigui!

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.080
He isn't here.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:56.680
He must have gone out.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.160
Let's head out to find him.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:14:59.760
Wait.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.200
Is this

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:04.280
what you're looking for?

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.640
The Skysplitter fragment.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.160
I don't need it anyway.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.160
You can have it.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.480
But...

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.800
But this isn't right.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.360
Thank you, Ye.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.000
Let's look for Weigui.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:25.720
Do you want to join us?

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.680
I'll stay and examine the place.

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:28.400
Just go.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:29.400
Okay.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:29.840
All right.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:30.480
Let's go.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:30.720
Let's go.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:31.520
Xiaohua.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:32.200
Take this.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:32.840
I might lose it.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:33.200
Okay.
