00:00:16.788 --> 00:00:18.665
Thanks for waiting.

00:00:18.748 --> 00:00:21.376
Here's your chicken katsu
and stewed fish meal.

00:00:21.459 --> 00:00:22.752
Check please.

00:00:22.836 --> 00:00:23.920
Okay.

00:00:32.095 --> 00:00:34.472
-Excuse me. Can you take my order?
-Yes.

00:00:35.098 --> 00:00:36.599
Welcome.

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:50.071
Now I just save this…

00:00:53.032 --> 00:00:54.492
Texture… Texture…

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.454
Oh crap!

00:00:59.581 --> 00:01:00.707
-Sorry, Shige.
-What?

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.878
For the family at table one,
their child can't eat seafood.

00:01:05.587 --> 00:01:08.631
Oh really?
We just ran out of ginger pork, right?

00:01:08.715 --> 00:01:09.841
Yes. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:11.676 --> 00:01:14.596
Think of something we can make
with the ingredients we have left.

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:16.014
Okay.

00:01:27.025 --> 00:01:30.695
We can make Japanese-style Hamburg Steak
using leftover gyoza filling.

00:01:31.654 --> 00:01:34.324
-Sounds good. Can you do that?
-Yes.

00:01:38.077 --> 00:01:39.245
Excuse me.

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.206
Will your daughter be all right
with Japanese-style Hamburg Steak?

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.124
‎Yes.

Taiga.

00:02:43.977 --> 00:02:45.270
I'll bring the sign in.

00:02:46.187 --> 00:02:49.023
We need to think about our
new seasonal menu soon.

00:02:49.565 --> 00:02:51.401
Can't wait to see what it'll be.

00:02:52.735 --> 00:02:53.611
Want to do it?

00:02:55.363 --> 00:02:57.782
Huh? Me?

00:02:58.783 --> 00:03:00.368
You've been here three years already.

00:03:04.747 --> 00:03:08.126
-Thank you. I will give it a try.
-Okay.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.509
Huh? What do you mean
I have to move out by May?

00:04:40.218 --> 00:04:44.764
The dormitory you are currently living in,
is going to be temporarily closed

00:04:44.847 --> 00:04:47.600
for major renovation work
due to deterioration.

00:04:48.393 --> 00:04:49.769
Deterioration…?

00:04:49.852 --> 00:04:54.607
Well… We have been notifying everybody
about this for a while now.

00:04:55.233 --> 00:04:57.693
We also sent you a notice in the mail.

00:04:57.777 --> 00:04:58.611

Did you not receive that?

00:05:08.121 --> 00:05:10.540
Sorry… I found it.

00:05:11.332 --> 00:05:13.209
-Um…
-Yes?

00:05:13.292 --> 00:05:16.379
Do you know of any place where I can live?

00:05:17.213 --> 00:05:20.216
The raffle for the student apartments
has ended already, so…

00:05:20.883 --> 00:05:25.805
I believe you have no choice
but to find housing on your own.

00:05:40.444 --> 00:05:41.696
Thank you for the food.

00:05:54.083 --> 00:05:55.334

00:05:55.418 --> 00:05:56.460

00:06:25.573 --> 00:06:27.325
Thank you.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.081
You're looking for a place that allows
immediate move-in and early termination?

00:06:34.165 --> 00:06:37.585
Yes. I need to move by next month.

00:06:38.586 --> 00:06:43.341
The choices are pretty limited
at this time of year…

00:06:44.675 --> 00:06:48.554
By the way, do you plan on staying
in Japan after graduation?

00:06:48.638 --> 00:06:49.931
What?

00:06:50.014 --> 00:06:52.558
If you don't have to terminate your lease
in less than a year,

00:06:52.642 --> 00:06:54.727
you will have a lot more options.

00:06:58.981 --> 00:07:00.066
I don't plan to.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.360
I see.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.966
You haven't captured the theme at all.

00:07:26.008 --> 00:07:27.635
The theme for this assignment

00:07:27.718 --> 00:07:30.972
was "the expression of unique textures,"
was it not?

00:07:31.556 --> 00:07:34.684
I do not see any thought
put into the textures.

00:07:35.851 --> 00:07:38.980
For example,
you could have shown how slimy it is,

00:07:39.063 --> 00:07:40.773
or crisp it is.

00:07:40.856 --> 00:07:44.360
You need to work on the expression,
and depiction of textures.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.280
Okay.

00:07:52.368 --> 00:07:53.661
Slimy…

00:07:55.454 --> 00:07:56.497
Slimy…

00:07:57.331 --> 00:07:59.625
Slimy? Slimy…

00:08:03.963 --> 00:08:06.090
Slimy…

00:08:06.173 --> 00:08:07.008
‎TRANSLATE
‎JAPANESE - KOREAN

00:08:10.595 --> 00:08:13.431
-Hello?
-Sorry for calling suddenly.

00:08:13.514 --> 00:08:16.392
About the property at Haibara Residence
that you were looking at…

00:08:16.475 --> 00:08:20.354
Another customer has just made
an appointment to take a tour of it.

00:08:21.439 --> 00:08:23.441
If you still want to apply for it,

00:08:23.524 --> 00:08:25.776
since you are of foreign nationality,

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.446
you will need
your certificate of enrollment

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:32.575
and a translated bank balance certificate.

00:08:41.125 --> 00:08:42.126
Hey.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.964
-He's Hase, my classmate from college.
-Welcome.

00:08:48.466 --> 00:08:52.303
He does have a toned, athletic build.
I can picture him running.

00:08:52.386 --> 00:08:56.641
He was so good that he was assigned to run
the first leg of the High School Ekiden.

00:08:56.724 --> 00:08:58.142
-Really?
-Right?

00:08:58.768 --> 00:09:02.188
Not only that, but in college
he ran alongside athletes

00:09:02.271 --> 00:09:04.190
like Kikuchi and Okubo.

00:09:04.273 --> 00:09:06.692
-That's amazing! They're so famous.
-Yeah!

00:09:06.776 --> 00:09:08.944
Do you still run now?

00:09:09.028 --> 00:09:10.946
No. That's all in the past.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.407
Hey! You should be more proud!

00:09:14.992 --> 00:09:17.244
Taiga, take the appetizers to table two.

00:09:17.328 --> 00:09:19.830
-Yes.
-What do you want to drink?

00:09:20.456 --> 00:09:21.749
Maybe bottled beer.

00:09:23.125 --> 00:09:25.044
Here is your certificate of enrollment.

00:09:25.878 --> 00:09:27.254
Thank you very much.

00:09:28.631 --> 00:09:29.924
Welcome.

00:09:40.559 --> 00:09:41.894

00:09:41.977 --> 00:09:45.439
-This please.
-Okay. It'll be about 30 minutes.

PARK RIN

00:10:16.554 --> 00:10:20.433
Thank you very much.
That completes your application.

00:10:21.058 --> 00:10:24.353
I will contact you again,
once everything is reviewed.

00:10:25.062 --> 00:10:26.731
Thank you.

00:10:39.201 --> 00:10:40.745
I'm hungry…

00:10:46.083 --> 00:10:47.793
-Thanks for your work.
-Thank you.

00:10:47.877 --> 00:10:48.711
See you.

00:10:49.336 --> 00:10:50.880
Hey, Shige.

00:10:53.132 --> 00:10:55.217
Thank you for earlier.

00:11:06.687 --> 00:11:09.690
‎TANOMI

00:11:19.074 --> 00:11:21.660
I'm sorry, we're closed for today.

00:11:26.457 --> 00:11:28.000
Okay…

00:12:02.284 --> 00:12:05.329
MAMAMON

00:12:09.792 --> 00:12:12.836
You didn't know they were
remodeling the dorm?

00:12:13.671 --> 00:12:15.548
How can that even be?

00:12:17.299 --> 00:12:22.638
Well… I was really busy
with my assignment.

00:12:22.721 --> 00:12:26.016
What are you going to do
if you can't find a place to live?

00:12:26.892 --> 00:12:30.688
I know. It won't happen again.

00:12:30.771 --> 00:12:33.524
You know, when I ask about school,
you always say

00:12:33.607 --> 00:12:36.735
that you're doing fine.

00:12:36.819 --> 00:12:39.363
But are you really
keeping up with the class?

00:12:39.446 --> 00:12:41.490
All right, I get it!

00:12:43.117 --> 00:12:45.578
I'll do what I can
to find a place to live.

00:12:46.245 --> 00:12:47.121
Bye.

00:13:05.514 --> 00:13:08.934
TERMINATION NOTICE

00:13:20.487 --> 00:13:23.324
Joesongham-- I mean, I'm sorry.

00:13:24.533 --> 00:13:26.410
Um, are you hurt?

00:13:27.745 --> 00:13:29.330
Not at all.

00:13:29.872 --> 00:13:31.957
I'm really sorry.

00:13:32.041 --> 00:13:33.876
-Let me give you…
-It's fine.

00:13:39.548 --> 00:13:41.842
I'm really okay.

00:13:41.925 --> 00:13:44.011
No, please accept my apology.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.138
Give me your hand, please.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:50.517
Here.

00:13:54.813 --> 00:13:56.148
Thank you.

00:14:04.114 --> 00:14:05.741
Well… sorry about that…

00:14:07.576 --> 00:14:08.827
Wait…

00:14:32.226 --> 00:14:33.310
Enjoy.

00:14:35.896 --> 00:14:37.690
Thank you very much.

00:14:53.122 --> 00:14:54.289
It's good.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:59.837
Out of all the onigiri I've had in Japan,
this is the best.

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:03.048
Thank you.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.229
Are you okay?

00:15:18.689 --> 00:15:21.859
Yeah… I just cut my finger earlier.

00:15:23.277 --> 00:15:24.611
Wait a second.

00:15:30.743 --> 00:15:31.577
‎Here.

00:15:35.164 --> 00:15:37.207
I cut my fingers a lot too, from cooking.

00:15:41.795 --> 00:15:43.422
Thank you.

00:15:52.181 --> 00:15:53.599
Have this too.

00:16:06.028 --> 00:16:07.654
This is amazing.

00:16:08.906 --> 00:16:10.532
What is this called?

00:16:10.616 --> 00:16:14.453
It's shigure-ni
with shishito peppers and beef.

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:16.872
Shigure-ni…

00:16:18.248 --> 00:16:21.460
It tastes like Korean jang-jorim.

00:16:21.543 --> 00:16:23.253
Jang-jorim?

00:16:24.004 --> 00:16:25.798
How do you make that?

00:16:26.882 --> 00:16:30.677
I'm sorry, I don't know.

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:33.555
I'm not good at cooking, actually.

00:16:35.432 --> 00:16:37.518
I'm good at eating, though.

00:16:50.864 --> 00:16:54.368
You eat like you really enjoy the food.

00:16:59.498 --> 00:17:00.332
‎Again?

00:17:01.208 --> 00:17:04.878
No, um… This is because…

00:17:06.088 --> 00:17:07.506
my stomach is stimulated.

00:17:11.051 --> 00:17:12.845
If I make more, will you eat it?

00:17:14.388 --> 00:17:15.556
Yes!

00:17:46.295 --> 00:17:48.255
Let me try this.

00:17:51.967 --> 00:17:53.093
That's sour!

00:17:54.761 --> 00:17:56.263
Tada!

00:18:03.395 --> 00:18:04.479
Shigure-ni, was it?

00:18:05.105 --> 00:18:08.066
That's what he stuffed it with.

00:18:09.193 --> 00:18:11.820
-Don't think about it.
-What?

00:18:13.113 --> 00:18:19.828
Park Rin, I have a massive database
of information from movies and dramas.

00:18:19.912 --> 00:18:21.330
And according to that,

00:18:21.413 --> 00:18:26.251
Japanese men are generally nice
to everyone by default.

00:18:26.335 --> 00:18:29.254
It's not because you're
particularly special.

00:18:32.007 --> 00:18:34.426
Didn't you used to live in Japan?

00:18:34.509 --> 00:18:36.345
Yeah, but I was in elementary school.

00:18:36.428 --> 00:18:38.555
Plus this isn't like that.

00:18:47.397 --> 00:18:49.441
I'm not going to date anyone.

00:18:49.524 --> 00:18:52.736
If my mom finds out,
she'll drag me back home immediately.

00:19:04.915 --> 00:19:06.625
The seasoning is totally different.

00:19:11.755 --> 00:19:13.382
It looks similar, though…

00:19:14.216 --> 00:19:17.219
JANG-JORIM

00:20:08.645 --> 00:20:09.855
Amazing…

00:20:10.897 --> 00:20:13.025
Truly a genius. A genius.

00:20:17.904 --> 00:20:19.072
I'm so jealous.

00:20:19.823 --> 00:20:23.118
If I had this kind of talent,
I bet I would have no worries.

00:20:29.458 --> 00:20:32.878
I see… Your mother is pretty mad, huh?

00:20:34.546 --> 00:20:39.092
I know. It's my fault.

00:20:39.718 --> 00:20:41.636
But when you're here, don't you sometimes

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:45.140
feel like you've become so stupid?

00:20:46.641 --> 00:20:48.852
Things like checking the mail,

00:20:48.935 --> 00:20:51.063
and riding the bus…

00:20:51.146 --> 00:20:54.941
Things that I used to do normally
have suddenly become so difficult.

00:20:56.151 --> 00:20:59.112
‎If someone were to say,

00:20:59.196 --> 00:21:02.324
‎"That's the life you chose,"

00:21:03.116 --> 00:21:04.993
I'd have nothing to say back.

00:21:05.911 --> 00:21:06.787
But…

00:21:08.246 --> 00:21:09.915
I used to be a little more competent.

00:21:12.417 --> 00:21:13.668
What are you saying?

00:21:15.253 --> 00:21:16.213
Rin,

00:21:16.713 --> 00:21:18.465
you're very competent.

00:21:19.049 --> 00:21:20.550
You'll get through this soon.

00:21:20.634 --> 00:21:23.095
Trust me on this one.

00:21:24.679 --> 00:21:25.806
Okay?

00:21:27.015 --> 00:21:29.351
Okay. Thank you.

00:21:31.144 --> 00:21:34.231
I only have a year left,
so I'll try my best.

00:21:36.358 --> 00:21:38.735
Okay. You can talk to me anytime.

00:21:43.448 --> 00:21:45.242
You need to go back soon, right?

00:21:46.159 --> 00:21:47.494
What will you do for lunch?

00:21:48.578 --> 00:21:51.790
I'll just grab some onigiri.

00:21:57.337 --> 00:21:58.463
Hey,

00:21:59.005 --> 00:22:04.052
there's a good restaurant near the school.

00:22:05.178 --> 00:22:08.140
Do you want to go with me next time?

00:22:08.723 --> 00:22:10.767
-Want to go tonight?
-Really?

00:22:11.768 --> 00:22:14.229
I'd love that. Thank you.

00:22:15.355 --> 00:22:16.523
Shall we go?

00:22:21.611 --> 00:22:24.281
CLOSED

00:22:29.744 --> 00:22:32.122
‎JUN-HO - UGH, I'M TOO LAZY TO DO IT…

00:22:32.205 --> 00:22:33.957
SORRY THEY'RE CLOSED.
LET'S GO ANOTHER TIME.

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.334
‎TANOMI

00:22:43.758 --> 00:22:48.346
I'm sorry. Today is our day off.

00:22:49.181 --> 00:22:51.600
Yeah, I just noticed.

00:22:54.603 --> 00:22:56.771
Well, I'll come again.

00:23:00.275 --> 00:23:03.695
Did you eat already?

00:23:06.781 --> 00:23:10.619
If you have time,
will you please give me your input?

00:23:11.411 --> 00:23:13.538
-Input?
-Yes.

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:18.251
I'm thinking of doing a Korean-style dish
for our new menu item,

00:23:18.335 --> 00:23:19.502
but…

00:23:21.087 --> 00:23:23.048
it's not going so well.

00:23:23.131 --> 00:23:24.466
I'd appreciate your advice.

00:23:26.593 --> 00:23:27.677
Of course.

00:23:30.555 --> 00:23:33.183
Before that, may I ask you one thing?

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:34.768
Yes?

00:23:35.894 --> 00:23:38.146
My name is Park Rin.

00:23:38.855 --> 00:23:39.814
What is your name?

00:23:42.275 --> 00:23:43.818
I'm Hase Taiga.

00:23:45.362 --> 00:23:47.530
I'll call you Taiga then.

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:57.290
I want to use okra for its unique texture.

00:23:58.458 --> 00:24:00.460
It's my first time seeing

00:24:00.543 --> 00:24:01.795
-an okra.
-Huh?

00:24:02.379 --> 00:24:04.172
You don't eat okra in Korea?

00:24:05.507 --> 00:24:07.092
Do Koreans not like the slimy texture?

00:24:09.427 --> 00:24:10.470
Slimy!

00:24:11.471 --> 00:24:13.765
What does that mean?

00:24:13.848 --> 00:24:15.850
Let's see…

00:24:16.935 --> 00:24:17.978
Give me a second.

00:24:18.603 --> 00:24:19.771
All right…

00:24:34.661 --> 00:24:35.787
It's like this.

00:24:39.332 --> 00:24:40.959
I see!

00:24:41.501 --> 00:24:44.212
So this is what "slimy" means.

00:24:45.297 --> 00:24:47.382
That's been bothering me.

00:24:48.383 --> 00:24:51.803
Sorry, can I take a video?

00:24:52.387 --> 00:24:53.680
Yes, of course.

00:24:54.806 --> 00:24:57.058
It might help me with my assignment.

00:24:58.601 --> 00:25:02.272
I'm in graduate school,
majoring in animation.

00:25:02.355 --> 00:25:03.940
Animation?

00:25:04.524 --> 00:25:05.900
That's cool.

00:25:07.569 --> 00:25:09.988
I'm pursuing my dream.

00:25:11.281 --> 00:25:13.825
What's your dream, Taiga?

00:25:13.908 --> 00:25:14.909
What?

00:25:16.119 --> 00:25:19.414
I like to hear about
other people's dreams.

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:25.295
I don't have a dream.

00:25:26.254 --> 00:25:30.425
I'm only working here because I started
as a part-timer and never left.

00:25:31.134 --> 00:25:33.970
So you're in training.

00:25:34.721 --> 00:25:36.723
Just like me.

00:25:39.059 --> 00:25:40.477
Let's do our best.

00:25:41.478 --> 00:25:42.520
You can do it!

00:25:47.359 --> 00:25:48.443
Oh, that's it.

00:25:48.526 --> 00:25:51.571
Can you make a dish that even Koreans

00:25:51.654 --> 00:25:53.865
who don't like slimy textures would enjoy?

00:25:55.116 --> 00:25:58.078
That's a pretty tall order.

00:25:58.161 --> 00:26:01.790
Oh, you will be able to do it, Taiga.

00:26:01.873 --> 00:26:04.376
You're able to make
such delicious onigiri, after all.

00:26:07.212 --> 00:26:08.463
It'll be fine.

00:26:09.672 --> 00:26:10.632
I'm sure.

00:26:22.143 --> 00:26:24.938
Okay. I'll give it a try.

00:26:30.944 --> 00:26:32.278
Korean pancake with natto.

00:26:47.168 --> 00:26:49.170
Bibim-guksu with mekabu seaweed.

00:27:15.113 --> 00:27:17.782
Okra wrapped in samgyeopsal.

00:27:30.086 --> 00:27:31.671
Thank you for the food.

00:27:36.676 --> 00:27:38.052
I'm stuffed.

00:27:38.761 --> 00:27:41.389
Thank you for today.

00:27:42.223 --> 00:27:44.559
I have a good idea of what to do now.

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.687
No, thank you.

00:27:49.355 --> 00:27:52.817
Make sure you let me know
when you've perfected the dish.

00:27:52.901 --> 00:27:53.818
Yes.

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:07.040
In Korea, you add your own contact info
into the other person's phone.

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:41.783
I need to take out the trash
before I leave.

00:28:45.703 --> 00:28:48.706
Okay. Bye then.

00:29:28.705 --> 00:29:32.166
Want to go to that
makgeolli place we went to last time?

00:29:32.876 --> 00:29:35.587
Sorry, I already ate.

00:29:36.629 --> 00:29:37.547
Oh really?

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:39.841
Well, since I'm here,
I'll give you a ride home.

00:29:42.135 --> 00:29:42.969
‎Let's go.

00:30:30.183 --> 00:30:31.017
It's good.

00:30:32.477 --> 00:30:35.897
-I'm impressed, Taiga.
-Thank you.

00:30:38.066 --> 00:30:43.655
But for our customers, we might want
to bring down the spiciness a little bit.

00:30:44.948 --> 00:30:46.658
Okay, I'll try that.

00:30:51.621 --> 00:30:52.455
SECOND WOMEN'S DORM

00:30:52.538 --> 00:30:54.999
It's already been a week,

00:30:55.833 --> 00:30:58.711
and I still haven't received any word.

00:30:59.712 --> 00:31:01.631
I told you, "Don't think about it."

00:31:02.924 --> 00:31:04.467
Japanese men

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:08.471
don't contact you
unless there is a reason to.

00:31:09.555 --> 00:31:14.102
Well then, how are you supposed to
get to know them better?

00:31:15.687 --> 00:31:19.190
You'll just have to take your time
with this one.

00:31:21.192 --> 00:31:23.653
It may take at least half a year.

00:31:24.445 --> 00:31:25.613
Half a year?

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.952
Who is it? Onigiri Man?

00:31:31.995 --> 00:31:34.998
KAEDE REAL ESTATE

00:31:50.805 --> 00:31:56.936
HELLO, RIN
THANKS TO YOU, OUR NEW MENU ITEM IS SET

00:32:06.529 --> 00:32:09.907
RIN - HOW ARE YOU DOING?

00:32:22.295 --> 00:32:23.212
Taiga,

00:32:23.296 --> 00:32:25.840
sorry for contacting you out of the blue.

00:32:26.424 --> 00:32:28.718
No problem,
I was just leaving work anyway.

00:32:29.886 --> 00:32:30.887
Also…

00:32:32.138 --> 00:32:34.432
-I'm doing good.
-Huh?

00:32:35.641 --> 00:32:37.477
Oh, I'm glad.

00:32:38.144 --> 00:32:39.979
But… um…

00:32:40.646 --> 00:32:43.900
I didn't hear from you, so I was worried.

00:32:45.818 --> 00:32:46.778
I'm sorry.

00:32:47.445 --> 00:32:51.032
It was officially added to the menu today,

00:32:51.115 --> 00:32:53.826
-so I was going to contact you--
-That's not what I mean.

00:32:54.327 --> 00:32:58.164
I mean keeping in touch
about normal, ordinary stuff.

00:33:00.416 --> 00:33:02.919
Normal, ordinary stuff?

00:33:04.128 --> 00:33:07.632
Sharing things about your everyday life,

00:33:08.257 --> 00:33:10.927
like what you saw and what you ate.

00:33:12.804 --> 00:33:15.014
In order to get to know each other.

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:19.977
But…

00:33:21.437 --> 00:33:24.941
wouldn't that make your boyfriend upset?

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:26.692
Boyfriend?

00:33:28.277 --> 00:33:29.362
The other day,

00:33:30.279 --> 00:33:33.533
he came to pick you up from the restaurant
in his car.

00:33:35.952 --> 00:33:37.495
Jun-ho!

00:33:37.578 --> 00:33:40.665
He's just a friend.
I don't have a boyfriend!

00:33:51.008 --> 00:33:55.513
Taiga, do you have a girlfriend?

00:34:01.018 --> 00:34:02.103
No, I don't.

00:34:09.819 --> 00:34:10.778
Rain…

00:34:15.908 --> 00:34:19.036
-Let's run and find some shelter.
-Okay.

00:34:58.159 --> 00:34:59.243
It's like The Classic.

00:35:01.662 --> 00:35:02.872
The Classic.

00:35:03.581 --> 00:35:07.335
This is like a scene
out of my favorite movie.

00:35:36.447 --> 00:35:37.865
Wow!

00:36:03.683 --> 00:36:04.892
Please, use this.

00:36:24.787 --> 00:36:26.872
No, it's just… It's been a while

00:36:27.456 --> 00:36:29.125
since I used a handkerchief.

00:36:30.376 --> 00:36:31.794
Thank you.

00:36:43.222 --> 00:36:46.934
It's strange…
I was feeling down just a minute ago,

00:36:47.643 --> 00:36:51.564
but after running in the rain,
I feel much better.

00:36:54.775 --> 00:36:57.028
Something's making you feel down?

00:37:02.116 --> 00:37:04.952
Right now, I'm searching
for a new place to live, but…

00:37:06.912 --> 00:37:08.539
my application was rejected.

00:37:18.049 --> 00:37:20.885
When I messaged you, "How are you doing?"

00:37:21.635 --> 00:37:22.636
I think

00:37:24.138 --> 00:37:27.099
I was subconsciously asking myself that.

00:37:34.523 --> 00:37:36.776
But I can't give up.

00:37:37.485 --> 00:37:40.529
Because I want to stay in Japan
a little while longer.

00:37:48.996 --> 00:37:49.997
Um…

00:38:00.174 --> 00:38:02.510
Sorry, what were you saying?

00:38:05.888 --> 00:38:07.598
Can I help you search?

00:38:09.016 --> 00:38:09.892
What?

00:38:12.019 --> 00:38:13.187
If you…

00:38:14.105 --> 00:38:15.147
‎don't mind.

00:38:28.702 --> 00:38:30.830
-You are amazing, Rin.
-Amazing?

00:38:31.622 --> 00:38:33.165
What about it is amazing?

00:38:33.249 --> 00:38:34.500
PREVIEW

00:38:34.583 --> 00:38:36.127
When I'm with you,

00:38:37.378 --> 00:38:40.506
I feel like I can move forward.

00:38:40.589 --> 00:38:43.092
‎THIS DRAMA IS FICTION AND ALL CHARACTERS
