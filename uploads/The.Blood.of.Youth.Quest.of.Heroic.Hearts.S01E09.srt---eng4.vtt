[Episode 9]

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.280
Great!

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.710
You finally woke up.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:33.280

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.240
Isn't...

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.150
Isn't this from the dream?

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.000
How come it's here?

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.680
It's the tip I gave you.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.240
When I arrived,

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.910
I noticed many peculiarities.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.710
The entire manor

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.190
is shrouded in miasma.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.910
And the poisonous miasma

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.310
pulled you into a dream.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.520
Liuli Manor

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.000
houses many precious treasures.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:59.630
The miasma

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.190
is a test it laid out.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.190
It can create illusions,

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.430
drawing you into avaricious nightmares.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.400
Only by seeing through the illusion

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.430
can you wake up

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.120
and stay in this manor

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.120
as an esteemed guest.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.590
Before I passed out,

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.400
I recalled a trick taught by my master.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.470
I kept sniffing the Sobering Incense,

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.960
but I still slept nonetheless.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.710
Perhaps

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.360
the Sobering Incense took effect.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.630
Before long,

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:33.800
I woke up.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.240
I monitored both of your conditions

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.430
and thought of a book.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:38.680
It said

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.800
that dreams

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.590
were the opposite of reality.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.190
The more active you are in a dream,

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.360
the harder it is for you to wake up.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.470
Instead,

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.750
you need to die in the dream...

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:48.030
Weigui!

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.030
... before you can wake up.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.800
Lei Lingze!

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.400
- To wake you up, - Wake up.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.120
I came up with this plan.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.960
Only by killing yourself

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.910
in the dream

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.000
can you wake up.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.560
Thank you, Miss Xiaohua.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.910
Otherwise, we

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.150
would have died here.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.240
There are only

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.310
the three of us here.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.150
How come

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.470
the Divine Maiden

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:10.710
was in my dream?

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.590
Could it be that

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.360
she also came to the manor?

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:18.600
Perhaps.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:20.630
We can't stay here for long.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.240
Let's get out.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.600
It's still day

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.870
but there is no one.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.600
The miasma is gone too.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.870
How was your rest, young heroes?

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.560
How was my rest?

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.270
Young Master Lin,

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.480
what is the meaning of this?

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.040
We saved you out of kindness.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.310
Yet you poisoned us and put us to sleep.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.240
Is this how you treat your guests?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
This is a misunderstanding.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.870
You just arrived at Liuli Manor.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.040
You might need time to get used to the mist here,

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.830
so I handed out pillows

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.430
for you to rest properly.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.390
I appreciate that.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.510
We have things to attend to.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.160
Farewell.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:04.270
I...

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.800
Wait.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.870
Halt.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.630
Young Master,

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.920
the Skysplitter fragment is gone.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:29.480
Young heroes,

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:31.480
the Skysplitter fragment

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.270
is the manor's prized possession.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.270
I'll

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.600
have to explain this to my father.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:38.830
I may need you to stay here to assist us

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.070
in the investigation.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.190
What does your oversight have anything

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.270
to do with us?

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:44.750
Are you saying

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.950
we took your fragment?

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.600
Young Master Lin.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.720
Ye.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.800
I know them well.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.160
They will not do such a thing.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.920
Ye, you are my father's esteemed guest.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.560
But they are...

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.160
I can retrieve

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.000
the Skysplitter fragment with them.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.310
It must be Tianwaitian's doing.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.000
But...

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.480
Young Master Lin,

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.560
I understand your concerns.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.160
I can stay here if you want.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.750
Xiaohua!

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:27.510
I

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.310
agree with you.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.190
You

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.480
are the best candidate to stay back.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:36.680
Miss Xiaohua.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:38.040
Take care.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.310
I'll count on all of you.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.600
Let's go.

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:59.070
Hua Xiaohua.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:02.600
Wait for us to come back.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.720
Look.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.800
Scattered footsteps.

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:26.120
There were many of them.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:27.920
Take the shortcut.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:00.920
What a coincidence.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.480
Are you

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.600
trying to run away after stealing the Skysplitter fragment?

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:19.480
Come.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.070
Give it back.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.750
And I may

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:24.480
spare all of you.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:27.430
Attack!

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:04.080
Run!

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.270
We got the fragment.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:26.790
Weigui.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:27.840
Are you okay?

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.670
Did you remember something?

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:51.360
Weigui.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.000
Is your past

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.360
related to the Divine Maiden

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.550
and

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.080
the Skysplitter as well?

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.630
I'm not too sure.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:10.550
Nevertheless,

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.270
do you

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.270
really think that once we gather

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:16.480
the Skysplitter fragments, we can have the Skysplitter?

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.670
No one knows if it's true or fake.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.870
But ever since the Skysplitter fragments appeared,

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:24.960
there have been conflicts.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.440
Each sect suffers heavy losses as they fight for the fragments.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:30.030
And the common folks live in misery.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.360
The imperial court doesn't care either.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.080
No one knows for sure if the fragments can make the Skysplitter.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:35.510
But the world

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.000
is indeed the worse for it.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:38.870
Ye,

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.630
the Divine Maiden

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.200
said the same thing too.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.270
Who?

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.000
Before you arrived

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.000
at Qingyin Parlor,

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.790
the Divine Maiden said the same thing.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:50.750
Ye.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.750
Have you met the Divine Maiden?

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:54.750
Do you know her?

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:55.510
We're running out of firewood.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:56.550
I'll gather some.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:57.750
Ye!

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:11.360
Oh,

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.510
Hua Xiaohua is stuck in Liuli Manor.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:15.440
We must find a way

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:16.960
to save her tomorrow morning.

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:18.480
Also,

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:20.320
see if the Skysplitter fragment

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:22.000
triggers your memory or not.

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:23.870
It might solve the mystery of your past.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.000
Think.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.150
What can you remember?

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.320
I can't remember everything,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.750
but I always see scenes from my childhood.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:35.630
I have a feeling

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:37.910
that my father's death

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.550
has something to do with the Skysplitter.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.870
And Xiao Se, the owner of the sword, once told me

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.870
that to find the Skysplitter, I must visit

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.320
the corridor.

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:50.320
- The corridor? - The corridor?

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.270
Do you remember where it is?

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:00.320
Not very clearly.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:01.480
But

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.790
I remember roughly what it looks like.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:06.390
Perhaps the sword

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:08.150
can lead us to Xiao Se

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:09.910
and my past.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.550
Who's there?

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:13.510
It's me.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:14.840
It's me.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:16.910
Hua Xiaohua?

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.390
Am I hallucinating?

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:21.510
I'm real.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.550
How did you escape?

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.870
Young Master Lin freed me.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.750
He didn't want people to continue

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:28.670
coveting

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.120
the Skysplitter fragment he used to own.

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:31.000
He added

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.360
that if we found the fragment,

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:33.480
there was no need to return.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.320
Then

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.120
why did we dream of the wedding ceremony with the ox-head butcher?

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.840
I heard that when the first owner of Liuli Manor got married,

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:41.960
his bride ran away.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:42.790
He then became a laughing stock.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.720
That might have something to do with your dream.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.790
Then why go through the trouble?

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:51.150
He

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.510
could've given us the fragment

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:53.360
from the beginning.

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:55.240
He didn't want to cross his father for it,

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:56.120
but he also

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.480
wanted to protect Liuli Manor.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.440
That's why he asked us not to return.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:03.870
Then

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:05.790
where should we go next?

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:08.360
I think

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.790
we should find the corridor.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.550
Let's spend a night here for now.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.000
We depart tomorrow.
