WEBVTT

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.430
Mr. Wang, we did everything we could.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.640
Our condolences.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.000
- Happy birthday to you.
- Happy birthday to me.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.830
- Happy birthday to you.
- Happy birthday to me.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.440
- Happy birthday to you.
- Happy birthday to me.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:24.760
Make a wish.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.070
I wish I'd get better soon.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.030
So I can go out with Dad

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.600
to ride the carousel

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.110
and the Ferris wheel.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.000
I want to be with Dad forever.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.750
We'll always be together.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.790
(Bai: New banquet tomorrow night)

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.200
(I'll pay you next time)

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.660
(Calling Bai)

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.200
(My daughter's surgery can't wait)

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.590
(I need the money now)

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.840
(When are you paying me?)

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.000
(Bai Qiming, stop playing dead)

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.790
(Where are you? Pick up!)

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.030
I'll avenge you.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:54.470
Hi, Mr. Liu.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.470
Mr. Bai.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.920
Where's the money?

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:01.710
Mr. Liu,

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.120
I'm really sorry.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.360
I will pay it back.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.800
Just give me a few more days.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.960
Please.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.080
In Qingcheng,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.080
no one dares to owe Liu Xijun money.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.920
Yes.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.680
If you can't pay,

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.240
you pay with your life.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:17.630
I'll end you

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.590
like crushing an ant.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.980
=The Hidden Truth=

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.620
=Episode 9=

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.640
Dad.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.600
Get him into the car.

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.720
Quick. Move.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.560
He's still breathing.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.480
What do we do now?

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:24.790
Dad,

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.510
do you know

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.310
any doctors?

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.360
No one can know about this.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.200
What if

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.720
he's badly hurt

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.630
and dies here?

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.240
Then we take him to the mountains

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:50.590
and bury him.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:16.560
Huahua…

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.510
Huahua…

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.160
My Huahua…

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.390
My Huahua…

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.560
My Huahua…

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:39.310
Huahua…

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.040
Let's play.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.630
Huahua…

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:10.680
What are you doing?

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.000
I'm going to kill him.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.240
- I'll kill him.
- Are you insane?

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.830
I'm killing him.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:17.670
Lower your voice.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.720
Put the knife down.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.270
Put it down.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.630
I want them dead.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.510
You can't kill anyone.

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.790
I want him dead.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.560
Your hands

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.000
can't be stained with blood.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.150
I'll be back soon.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.200
Dad, I'll go with you.

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:54.080
Stay home.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.080
Stop doing everything alone.

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:00.150
Let me come with you.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.120
Ali, you're back.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.030
I cleaned the blood

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:29.320
at the door.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:41.840
Come in.

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:12.390
What exactly

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:15.390
is your relationship with Bai?

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.350
Ali,

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:21.080
he threatened me

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:23.840
and used me to get close to you.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:27.550
He has leverage on me.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:30.910
From the day I met you

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.790
until now,

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.030
how you treated me,

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.320
I know it in my heart.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.840
I just want to tell you the truth.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.000
I don't want to lie anymore.

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:27.710
Actually,

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:31.790
I ran away

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.510
from a village near Shancheng.

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:38.440
I'm married.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.150
I've got a husband.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:43.150
He's a drunk

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:45.440
who beat me every time he drank.

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:48.390
Eight years together.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.240
Beaten into four miscarriages.

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:56.120
We had no children.

00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:59.790
I knew

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.670
if it went on,

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.240
he'd beat me to death.

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:11.480
So I made up my mind

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:13.600
and ran.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.240
Four months ago,

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:25.120
I met Bai.

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:26.790
He said

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.270
you were his enemy

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:30.200
and made me move across from you

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.630
to get close to you.

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:36.030
If I didn't,

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:41.030
he'd tell my husband where I was.

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:47.720
Why are you

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.670
telling us this now?

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.200
Because you're a good man.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.320
And Yimo

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:57.670
is a good girl.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:00.120
The care you've shown me

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.080
has always been heartfelt.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.790
With you,

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.200
I felt like I got a second life.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:12.710
Ali,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.080
I truly wanted

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.270
to be a family

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:19.360
with you and Yimo.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:21.150
So many times

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:22.510
I wanted to tell the truth.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.030
But I was afraid

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.030
Bai would destroy everything.

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:34.320
Even more,

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:38.030
I was afraid

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:40.630
you'd hate me.

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:48.030
Now that it's all out,

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.360
I feel lighter.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.150
It doesn't get any worse.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.320
But I truly

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.270
don't want to lie anymore.

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:07.840
Does Bai know you're exposed?

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.280
No.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.790
He just thinks

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:13.550
I've given him less info lately.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.480
I can still calm him down for now.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:20.750
Ali,

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:22.870
whether you believe me or not,

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.550
let me help you once.

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:26.840
Let me be involved.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:28.550
You'll trust me more that way.

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:31.670
After this,

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:35.750
if you want me gone,

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.390
I'll leave

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:43.030
you and Yimo for good.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:46.960
I won't disturb you anymore.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.550
You see,

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:52.510
I need

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:54.790
to deal with him now.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.080
I work at a pet shop, right?

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:07.270
We partner

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.270
with a pet funeral service.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.320
They have a cremator.

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:15.630
That should work.

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:41.480
Lately,

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:43.000
Bai's been planning something.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.000
He might go after you two.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.680
Be careful.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.030
Do you smell that?

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:29.790
What are you doing?

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:34.920
The air

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:47.720
smells like revenge.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.110
You're crazy.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:59.590
Relax.

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:02.510
It's part of the plan.

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:55.480
Boss, Wang Li's here.

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:04.590
Mr. Wang.

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:07.000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:15.760
Mr. Wang,

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.640
what do you think?

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:18.880
I've given your office

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.310
a fresh touch.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.160
Does it look

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.070
more prosperous?

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:25.270
The restaurant's yours now.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.920
What about what you promised me?

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:34.110
You give me the restaurant.

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:35.720
I give you Bai.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.200
Fair and square, right?

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:39.480
However,

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.550
Bai's slippery.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.590
I need time.

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:49.350
We can't wait anymore.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.030
I told you he's a maniac.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.350
It's too dangerous

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:54.800
to have him on the loose.

00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:58.440
I understand.

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:01.400
The moment I get news,

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.920
you'll be the first to know.

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:10.190
Gotta go.

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.320
Bye.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.080
Boss.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.480
Is Wang Li pushing us to find Bai?

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:31.510
Should we send the guys out?

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:33.880
What are you talking about?

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.960
Is he your boss or am I?

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:38.750
What, trying to switch sides?

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.240
Who is he anyway?

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.310
What's Wang Li even worth to us?

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:45.680
Hunting for him?

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.750
I'm his errand boy now?

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.070
Whatever crap he's got with Bai,

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:51.590
that's their mess.

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:53.310
We've already got the restaurant.

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:54.630
What does it have to do with us?

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:56.030
Let them fight it out.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.440
Yes. Boss, you're right.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:22:59.720
You think?

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:01.590
I told you to get the tea.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.720
Forgot. I'll go now, right now.

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:04.560
Hey...

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.830
Useless.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.550
We're closed today.

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:24.350
You...

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:25.750
Bomb.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:27.760
Here you go.

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:31.960
Isn't that the cook from last time?

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:33.960
Didn't get enough?

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.510
Where are our people?

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:37.110
Where's Wang Li?

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:40.350
Wang Li sold the restaurant to our boss.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.920
Get lost. Or you'll be in trouble.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:43.520
Get lost.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.480
I'll...

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.200
Nobody move.

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:04.150
Drop it.

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:06.280
Don't do anything stupid.

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:20.820
(Wang Li)

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.830
Hongyun Restaurant is mine now.

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:31.830
Pfft. What profit?

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:33.240
I lost plenty.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.200
Still have to think about how to run it.

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:38.070
That's why I called

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:39.000
to ask if you know

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.680
any reliable accountants.

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.860
(Bai wants to see you)

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:23.910
What is it?

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.110
I saw Wang Li and his daughter.

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:44.200
They went home.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:46.670
And?

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:51.070
Since Li Xu took over Hongyun,

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:54.030
Wang Li looks crushed.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:55.920
Doesn't want to see anyone.

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:11.590
That's it?

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:17.200
You came all the way just to tell me that?

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.000
I…

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:25.960
I'm almost out of money.

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:28.880
Rent's about to be due.

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:51.240
Think you're working for me for pay?

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:53.350
Asking me for money?

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:57.110
Get this straight.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.720
Watching over Wang Li

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.400
is your chance to protect yourself.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.520
You want cash?

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:05.000
Figure it out yourself.

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:07.200
Keep your eyes on them.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.590
If they try to run,

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:11.720
tell me immediately.

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:15.190
Get out.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.080
Mr. Li.

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.240
Especially for you.

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:29.310
Not good enough?

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:33.920
You just took Hongyun Restaurant.

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:38.790
Another step up.

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.160
Should've been mine in the first place.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:45.840
Bai,

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.310
your mess with Wang Li

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:51.510
has dragged me into chaos.

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:54.000
Is this fun to you?

00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.400
It's just you today?

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:01.310
No crew?

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.790
Feels strange.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:09.720
Li,

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.830
burning bridges like that

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.310
isn't smart.

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:32.270
Save the threats.

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:35.350
If you called me here,
it means I'm still useful.

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.030
So say it. Why am I here?

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.750
Relax.

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.920
I asked you here today,

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:53.270
just to ask you something.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.680
Squeezing one restaurant

00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:57.550
out of Wang Li,

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.070
you think that's enough?

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.200
One restaurant's not enough

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.590
to cover my losses.

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.000
Let me tell you.

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.270
Wang Li has plenty of money.

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:21.590
I can bleed him dry for you.

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:24.150
But,

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:27.070
you need to do me a small favor.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.560
Say it.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:30.800
What favor?

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:37.350
I want the father and daughter.

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:46.590
Have some milk.

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.030
Good for your health.

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:12.440
Huahua…

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:15.310
Huahua…

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:18.200
My Huahua…

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:24.840
Yimo.

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:26.150
Yimo.

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:27.440
It's Dad.

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:36.550
What's wrong?

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:39.150
Dad.

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:44.350
I had a nightmare.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.040
It's okay.

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:49.270
I'm here.

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.040
Dad.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:01.840
If my hands

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:04.880
have already

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.350
stained with blood,

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:12.590
will you still let me be your daughter?

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:16.440
Don't say that.

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:21.160
My daughter's hands

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:23.270
have never touched blood.

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.440
Before I "officially" came back,

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:30.520
- I...
- Don't say it.

00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:37.960
You came back
the day we were at Hongyun.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.640
Whatever happened before that

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.000
has nothing to do with you.
