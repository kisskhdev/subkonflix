=Episode 8=

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.720
Can we extract DNA?

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.361
Waiting for the results.

00:02:25.401 --> 00:02:28.600
If we can confirm
these hairs belong to the victim,

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.720
then the owner of these clothes
is the real killer.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.681
You're staying here all night,

00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:44.880
leaving your dad alone?

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.880
Ms. Wang's with him.

00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:48.521
Have you eaten?

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.961
Bread's over there.

00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:50.760
Have some.

00:02:51.361 --> 00:02:52.841
Otherwise, your stomach will hurt.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.720
I ate.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.200
I'll go to Jiao.

00:03:18.801 --> 00:03:19.920
Any new clues?

00:03:20.281 --> 00:03:20.920
Master.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.081
Sit.

00:03:23.361 --> 00:03:25.160
Judging from this video,

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.920
these two individuals have
very similar builds and clothing.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.241
The bag he's carrying

00:03:30.241 --> 00:03:33.681
is basically identical to the one
we fished out of the lake.

00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:36.640
So we can conclude
they're the same person.

00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:40.521
If they're the same person,

00:03:41.121 --> 00:03:45.121
then this person exited the south gate
of the community at 1:05 AM,

00:03:45.121 --> 00:03:47.681
and reached the pond by 1:15 AM.

00:03:48.001 --> 00:03:49.640
That's several kilometers away.

00:03:50.401 --> 00:03:51.361
He was quite quick.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.440
After dumping the bag,

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.640
where did he go?

00:03:59.224 --> 00:04:03.960
(South gate, Pond)

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.801
Qian.

00:04:32.632 --> 00:04:35.736

(Dan Qing, long time no see.
Available this weekend?)

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.481
He took the bait already?

00:05:19.921 --> 00:05:22.561
Seems he still can't forget you.

00:05:23.001 --> 00:05:23.640
Right?

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.960
Bao Hei will definitely
send people to watch.

00:05:29.361 --> 00:05:32.561
Let's hope your ex-boyfriend is smart.

00:05:33.801 --> 00:05:35.241
I don't care.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.921
As long as he takes the bait,

00:05:40.041 --> 00:05:41.241
he can't escape.

00:05:49.944 --> 00:05:51.400
(Yunxi Police Department)

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.721
The blood

00:05:52.921 --> 00:05:54.921
(Hauled up: Sports jacket, scalpel, etc.)
on the gloves and on the scalpel

00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:57.520
are confirmed to belong
to the victim, Wang Xiaole.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.520
On the sports jacket,

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.760
I detected two different DNAs.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.840
One belongs to the victim Wang Xiaole,

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.561
the other is from an unknown male.

00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:11.921
I found some hairs
on the zipper of the sports jacket.

00:06:11.921 --> 00:06:14.721
Testing confirmed they also
belong to the victim Wang Xiaole.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.400
Based on the location, I speculate

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.440
when the killer

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.840
(Hauled up: Key, rubber gloves, etc.)
grabbed Wang Xiaole's hair,

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.001
he tore it out during repeated impacts.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.681
So we can be fairly certain
this unknown male is the killer.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.681
Can we find this person using the DNA?

00:06:29.161 --> 00:06:30.880
I've already uploaded the data.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.520
If this person has a previous record
in our system,

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.760
then we'll find him quickly.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.161
But if not,

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.200
then I can only run a comparison
after we apprehend a suspect.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.080
But we can confirm it's not Wu Da.

00:06:43.481 --> 00:06:46.320
This key appears to be a duplicate.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.041
Does it open
the victim's apartment door?

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.280
We've tried, Captain Leng.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:50.960
It does open.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.760
That bag looks like the giveaway
for signing up for a gym membership.

00:06:53.921 --> 00:06:55.481
If there's a brand on the bag,

00:06:55.481 --> 00:06:56.960
we could trace it.

00:06:57.161 --> 00:06:59.561
That gym went out of business years ago.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.921
Long, go sleep in my room.

00:07:11.721 --> 00:07:14.320
No prints on that thing.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.041
He wore gloves.

00:07:17.161 --> 00:07:19.721
Young people can sleep soundly.
I really envy him.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.880
I have some findings on the video.

00:07:26.104 --> 00:07:28.152
(Dongyuan, Alley 07)

00:07:28.152 --> 00:07:30.808
But it can't be enlarged any further.
This is the best it gets.

00:07:31.064 --> 00:07:35.161
Now we know the person is
in medium build, on the thin side.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.041
Estimated height
between 1.75m and 1.80m.

00:07:40.361 --> 00:07:42.280
He was heading towards Dongyuan.

00:07:43.121 --> 00:07:44.880
Dongyuan is an urban village.

00:07:45.481 --> 00:07:48.001
The permanent population
might be at least 3,000.

00:07:48.001 --> 00:07:48.640
Oh, no.

00:07:48.921 --> 00:07:50.361
That's just permanent population.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.481
Including migrant population,
it would be more.

00:07:52.481 --> 00:07:53.320
That's much more.

00:07:53.921 --> 00:07:56.921
The roads and terrain
in Dongyuan are complex.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.080
There are only about
seven or eight cameras total.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.520
Too many blind spots.

00:08:04.601 --> 00:08:06.921
If he is a resident of Dongyuan,
that would be manageable.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.440
If he just passed through

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.681
Dongyuan or hid there
briefly before leaving,

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.001
that makes it tricky.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.121
I'll say something.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.440
We currently know the suspect

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.128
had been peeking at the victim
for years from the pine woods

00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:24.208
behind Shancheng Community.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.921
That shows he's quite familiar
with the surrounding terrain.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.280
West of Shancheng Community,

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.561
less than 500 meters away

00:08:30.561 --> 00:08:31.840
(Map)
is the Ring Road.

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.880
The traffic there is very convenient.

00:08:33.961 --> 00:08:35.961
He could discard the clothes
along the way.

00:08:35.961 --> 00:08:38.104
The suspect left Shancheng Community

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.880
after the crime
without drawing attention.

00:08:40.001 --> 00:08:43.520
So I don't think he would
deliberately take a detour

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.481
to Dongyuan in the opposite direction.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.400
That'd also increase the risk
of being spotted and noticed.

00:08:55.241 --> 00:08:58.920
I think even if the suspect isn't
a permanent resident of Dongyuan,

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.800
he at least frequents this area.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.481
Captain Leng, I think

00:09:05.721 --> 00:09:08.481
if we take action
in the Dongyuan jurisdiction now,

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.760
we might alert the suspect
and he might flee?

00:09:13.361 --> 00:09:16.640
Our operation to dredge the sewage pond
was quite a scene.

00:09:17.441 --> 00:09:20.560
If the suspect was watching
from the shadows,

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.241
he must have alerted by now.

00:09:26.121 --> 00:09:28.520
Otherwise, to be safe,

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.576
we'll first coordinate with
the community security unit,

00:09:31.576 --> 00:09:34.400
and conduct a sweep under the pretext
of preventing robbery and theft.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.880
Start with the permanent residents.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.560
You, Wang Tong.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.121
Here!

00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:39.680
Liu Yang.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:40.081
Here!

00:09:40.081 --> 00:09:42.296
Based on the social circles
of Wu Da and Wang Xiaole,

00:09:42.991 --> 00:09:44.241
you conduct an investigation

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.280
to see if anyone has connections
to the Dongyuan area.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.280
Action! Hurry!

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:48.760
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.920
This is the Dongyuan urban village.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.241
Let's go take a look.

00:10:07.081 --> 00:10:07.760
Alright.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:08.201
This way.

00:10:16.201 --> 00:10:17.040
Who's the owner?

00:10:17.201 --> 00:10:18.800
Me! I'm the owner.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.201
Ask you something.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.361
We're from CID.

00:10:21.361 --> 00:10:21.880
Okay.

00:10:25.841 --> 00:10:26.481
Ma'am.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.560
Yes?

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.280
Ask you something.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:29.361
What is it?

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.201
Are your customers all regulars?

00:10:32.361 --> 00:10:33.640
- Any unfamiliar faces?
- Yes.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.361
All residents from nearby.

00:10:35.361 --> 00:10:36.121
All residents?

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:36.760
Yes.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:37.520
No strangers?

00:10:37.601 --> 00:10:38.121
No.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.081
Just ahead.

00:10:41.361 --> 00:10:42.121
Thank you.

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.081
Okay, no problem.

00:10:51.081 --> 00:10:51.880
This one's ready.

00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:52.640
Hurry.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.361
Okay. Come on.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.441
Have one.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:00.241
I'm not hungry.

00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:04.040
Take it easy.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.224
How long have you been a policeman?

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.241
Four years.

00:11:10.081 --> 00:11:10.880
Four years?

00:11:13.841 --> 00:11:14.401
Well, I...

00:11:15.192 --> 00:11:16.920
I became a policeman at twenty.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.441
I'll be retiring soon.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:23.400
I wanted to go all out
on this Shancheng case.

00:11:24.201 --> 00:11:26.721
But I'm old now, not capable as before.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.841
Can't keep up
with you young folks anymore.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.520
What flavor?

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.160
Ms. Wang.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:58.680
You're back.

00:11:59.081 --> 00:12:00.481
Dinner's kept warm for you.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.721
Go wash your hands and eat.

00:12:03.241 --> 00:12:04.040
Dad.

00:12:14.441 --> 00:12:15.441
Leng.

00:12:15.721 --> 00:12:18.280
I won't wash these dishes
of yours today, okay?

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.361
Well, you got off work early.

00:12:20.361 --> 00:12:22.441
I want to go back early today.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.201
My daughter brought the kids over

00:12:25.201 --> 00:12:27.361
and they're staying
at my place for a few days.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.520
Alright. Thank you.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.321
Leng, well...

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.920
I've worked for you
for years now, right?

00:12:37.081 --> 00:12:39.680
Well, we know each other pretty well.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.640
You know how expensive
everything is nowadays.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.201
I have elderly and kids to support.

00:12:48.312 --> 00:12:49.321
- I need to...
- Ms. Wang.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:50.441
Ms. Wang, I understand.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.040
My dad can't be left alone.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.680
Well, I'll give you
an extra 800 yuan a month.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.680
What do you think?

00:12:59.201 --> 00:13:01.241
That's too much.

00:13:02.001 --> 00:13:02.800
Thank you.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.121
My job is really demanding.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.160
You really helped me a lot.

00:13:07.841 --> 00:13:08.601
No problem.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:09.841
Then it's settled.

00:13:09.841 --> 00:13:10.441
Okay.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.601
I-I'm leaving then.

00:13:11.601 --> 00:13:12.721
Alright. Take care.

00:13:54.601 --> 00:13:56.081
I saw it online.

00:13:56.601 --> 00:13:59.241
Didn't expect
he's running an art gallery now.

00:14:26.008 --> 00:14:33.624
(Phone password)

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.121
Okay, see you then.

00:15:10.121 --> 00:15:10.920
Who's it?

00:15:11.721 --> 00:15:12.961
Who are you meeting then?

00:15:13.361 --> 00:15:14.361
None of your business.

00:15:14.841 --> 00:15:16.160
Is it your unrequited love?

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.601
How's it going? Tell me.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.800
You're wearing this tomorrow?

00:15:28.441 --> 00:15:29.001
What's wrong?

00:15:30.601 --> 00:15:32.961
It's nice. Suits you.

00:15:39.081 --> 00:15:39.880
Good taste.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:57.760
Master.

00:15:58.841 --> 00:16:00.361
New info from the medical school.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.201
They found the guy who got into
a fight with Wu Da during school.

00:16:04.481 --> 00:16:05.800
He is Niu Bosheng,

00:16:05.961 --> 00:16:07.321
male, 34 years old,

00:16:07.321 --> 00:16:08.001
a local.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.841
Ph.D. in Clinical Medicine
from Yunxi Medical University.

00:16:11.841 --> 00:16:14.760
They were in the same year at college,
but in different classes.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:18.241
He attended the same middle school
and high school as Wang Xiaole.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.280
He joined the mountaineering club
in college.

00:16:21.432 --> 00:16:24.152
After graduation, he worked
in General Surgery at Central Hospital.

00:16:24.952 --> 00:16:26.441
Under the counterpart support policy,

00:16:26.441 --> 00:16:30.201
he holds clinic hours every Wednesday
at Dongyuan Community Health Center.

00:16:31.321 --> 00:16:33.640
Wu Da got into a physical fight
with him during school.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.081
They got a demerit for it.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.721
So why did they fight?

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.841
Wu Da accused Niu Bosheng
of peeking and harassing Wang Xiaole.

00:16:48.248 --> 00:16:56.472
(Yunxi Central Hospital)

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.400
You did it on purpose?

00:16:59.441 --> 00:17:01.040
Didn't we agree not to wear it together?

00:17:01.481 --> 00:17:03.001
I swear on my life, man.

00:17:03.001 --> 00:17:04.360
I was sleeping when you got up.

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:05.881
How did I know you'd wear this?

00:17:07.001 --> 00:17:07.961
If you can't stand it,

00:17:07.961 --> 00:17:09.520
there's a clothing store.

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:10.481
Go buy a new one.

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:12.560
Why don't you buy one?

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.040
First, this isn't my fault.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.441
You should've told me last night.

00:17:15.441 --> 00:17:17.320
Second, I'm broke.

00:17:23.481 --> 00:17:25.080
It's field work today.

00:17:25.441 --> 00:17:26.520
Why are you coming along?

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:27.641
Your master said

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.280
that person is basically
a high-IQ criminal.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.721
You might need help, so he sent me.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:37.320
Don't reveal who we are at first.
Just talk to him.

00:17:37.641 --> 00:17:38.560
See how he reacts.

00:17:39.001 --> 00:17:40.360
Of course. Let's go.

00:17:44.441 --> 00:17:45.560
That's it?

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.641
Yes. Enter the info and hit submit.

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:48.600
That's it.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:49.481
Okay, thanks.

00:17:49.481 --> 00:17:49.961
No problem.

00:17:52.401 --> 00:17:53.201
Registered.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.161
You! Stay away from me!

00:18:04.881 --> 00:18:06.681
Where can I go? It's crowded here.

00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:08.201
I wish to stay away from you.

00:18:16.481 --> 00:18:18.201
Way too crowded.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:22.560
All hospitals are like this, crowded.

00:18:23.961 --> 00:18:24.800
Definitely.

00:18:26.001 --> 00:18:30.080
(Patient 047, Si Yuanlong,
please proceed to Room 1.)

00:18:31.241 --> 00:18:32.201
Let's go.

00:18:37.881 --> 00:18:39.201
Which one of you is the patient?

00:18:41.481 --> 00:18:43.641
Me. He's just here with me.

00:18:45.201 --> 00:18:47.241
A grown man needs company
to see the doctor?

00:18:47.641 --> 00:18:49.520
I'm emotionally fragile.

00:18:49.681 --> 00:18:50.600
What's the problem?

00:18:53.201 --> 00:18:54.120
My hand hurts.

00:18:57.681 --> 00:18:59.001
The wound's healing okay.

00:18:59.721 --> 00:19:02.080
Scar tissue doesn't look hypertrophic.

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.641
How did this happen?

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.008
Well...

00:19:07.352 --> 00:19:07.921
It...

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.201
He got drunk and rowdy with me.

00:19:11.201 --> 00:19:12.201
He even pulled a knife

00:19:12.201 --> 00:19:13.520
and said I stole his girlfriend.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.641
Tell me, is he crazy?

00:19:15.161 --> 00:19:15.760
Listen up!

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.201
I want all of it covered,

00:19:17.201 --> 00:19:19.080
the medical bills,
the trauma, everything!

00:19:19.401 --> 00:19:21.401
Why should I pay? Not a chance!

00:19:21.721 --> 00:19:23.681
You kept texting my girlfriend,

00:19:23.681 --> 00:19:25.520
like a ghost haunting me.

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.080
Yet you want me to pay your bills?

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:27.881
Wanting a beating?

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.481
Me? You're insane!

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:31.961
You always pester her.

00:19:31.961 --> 00:19:33.961
It's one-sided love. You know?

00:19:33.961 --> 00:19:35.360
Your girlfriend? You...

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:35.960
You...

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.881
You two, go out if you want to quarrel.

00:19:40.881 --> 00:19:41.721
This is a hospital.

00:19:44.641 --> 00:19:46.881
I'll prescribe you
erythromycin ointment.

00:19:46.881 --> 00:19:48.120
Apply it for several days.

00:19:49.881 --> 00:19:50.641
Okay.

00:19:50.641 --> 00:19:51.241
Alright.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:53.600
Anything else?

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.320
What's going on?

00:19:58.641 --> 00:19:59.600
Sorry, Doctor.

00:20:07.201 --> 00:20:07.881
Sorry.

00:20:07.881 --> 00:20:09.320
I'm really sorry.

00:20:28.481 --> 00:20:30.320
W-Wear the mask.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.800
Okay. Thank you.

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.001
We'll go get the medicine.

00:20:34.001 --> 00:20:34.721
Go get it.

00:20:34.721 --> 00:20:35.840
Thank you.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:45.641
Hello.

00:21:46.001 --> 00:21:48.001
Captain Leng, we have the results.

00:21:48.201 --> 00:21:50.881
It matches the male DNA
on that sports jacket.

00:21:52.201 --> 00:21:53.921
Thank you for your hard work.

00:21:54.441 --> 00:21:56.441
Tell the forensic unit staff
to get off work early.

00:21:56.921 --> 00:21:57.401
Okay.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:13.241
Confirmed.

00:22:54.392 --> 00:22:57.880
(Longyan)

00:23:03.201 --> 00:23:04.080
- Good!
- Impressive!

00:23:05.681 --> 00:23:07.600
Little Qian,
your cooking skills are amazing.

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.840
Why not consider being my partner?

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.441
You're wrong.

00:23:11.441 --> 00:23:13.721
Little Qian is the star
of our police force,

00:23:14.241 --> 00:23:15.760
Captain Leng's prized student.

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.481
He'll become unit chief,
deputy chief, then chief someday.

00:23:18.481 --> 00:23:20.481
Then off to the province, the ministry.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.800
Your small place can't satisfy him.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.120
But it can satisfy me.

00:23:24.681 --> 00:23:26.040
You? What can you do?

00:23:26.641 --> 00:23:28.600
I can be the fortune cat.

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.481
I'm serious.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:32.840
Quit being a policeman.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.721
It's exhausting and pays poorly.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:35.921
Think about it.

00:23:39.201 --> 00:23:41.520
You won't run off
early again today, right?

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.681
No, we definitely won't run off today.

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.881
What made you decide to cook here today?

00:23:58.881 --> 00:24:00.600
I promised him this before.

00:24:11.401 --> 00:24:12.201
Si Yuanlong.

00:24:15.001 --> 00:24:15.881
You like me?

00:24:18.201 --> 00:24:18.921
Y-Yes.

00:24:18.921 --> 00:24:21.280
Haven't I told you
s-several times before?

00:24:21.401 --> 00:24:23.201
It's real, not a joke.

00:24:23.401 --> 00:24:24.881
Do you still want to be my friend?

00:24:26.441 --> 00:24:28.201
I really enjoy being friends with you.

00:24:28.401 --> 00:24:30.120
But I don't like you as my boyfriend.

00:24:32.641 --> 00:24:33.481
And you, Ye Qian.

00:24:33.481 --> 00:24:35.080
I'm telling you. It's unnecessary.

00:24:36.481 --> 00:24:38.201
It's my business that I like you.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.360
You don't have to like me,
but don't set me up with anyone.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:42.120
What do you mean?

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:43.641
Do you look down on me or on him?

00:24:50.441 --> 00:24:52.001
I'm not worth your time.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:53.721
I'm sorry.

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.080
Wait. Are you really leaving?

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.641
You're just letting him leave?

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:14.800
Leave if you want.

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:19.001
I won't leave.

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.441
I'll stay with you.

00:25:26.721 --> 00:25:27.600
Sorry.

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.800
I was a bit harsh just now.

00:25:30.201 --> 00:25:31.040
Don't mind it.

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.721
It's fine.

00:25:32.721 --> 00:25:33.800
I'm glad that you see me

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.320
as a friend. Really.

00:25:35.441 --> 00:25:37.280
And I don't have many merits,

00:25:37.401 --> 00:25:39.201
but I'm definitely thick-skinned.

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.001
Did he get any news
about Chen Yumo recently?

00:25:50.641 --> 00:25:52.280
W-Why would you say that?

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.080
He's been in a good mood lately.

00:25:54.201 --> 00:25:56.080
He never apologizes to me
if he's in a bad mood.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.241
Well, he does have an appointment later.

00:26:04.641 --> 00:26:06.921
Probably with his unrequited love.

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:09.241
But I don't know the details.

00:26:09.241 --> 00:26:11.721
I just overheard them
chatting on WeChat.

00:26:11.721 --> 00:26:13.120
Do you know where they're going?

00:26:13.641 --> 00:26:15.641
To a place called Niu something...

00:26:15.641 --> 00:26:17.481
Probably a gallery run
by one of your friends?

00:26:19.441 --> 00:26:20.881
Come on. Let's go see the show.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.641
It's inappropriate.

00:26:24.201 --> 00:26:25.120
Coming or not?

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.080
If not, I'll go alone.

00:26:27.241 --> 00:26:28.040
Yes.

00:26:28.401 --> 00:26:29.401
If you go, I'll go.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.360
Name.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:36.401
Niu Bosheng.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:38.921
Niu Bosheng.

00:26:40.201 --> 00:26:42.201
Do you know why you're here?

00:26:43.881 --> 00:26:44.921
Xiaole is dead.

00:26:46.001 --> 00:26:47.520
You would definitely find me.

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.080
Tell us.

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.800
What did you do to Wang Xiaole?

00:26:58.201 --> 00:27:02.161
I set up a telescope in the woods

00:27:03.441 --> 00:27:04.641
north of her community.

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.681
You call that peeping.

00:27:08.201 --> 00:27:10.040
So why were you peeping at Wang Xiaole?

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:13.401
I love her.

00:27:15.401 --> 00:27:16.280
That's all?

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:19.600
That's all.

00:27:28.504 --> 00:27:45.848
(Modern Art Exhibition)

00:27:53.641 --> 00:27:56.080
Little Qian looks quite decent now.

00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.921
Why doesn't he just put on makeup?

00:28:00.481 --> 00:28:02.320
This is almost like wearing makeup.

00:28:04.921 --> 00:28:08.681
Right. About that thing, don't...

00:28:09.001 --> 00:28:10.201
Let's not mention that.

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:12.241
Okay.

00:28:12.241 --> 00:28:14.721
Besides, we don't suit.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:19.001
From family background
to interests to careers.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.441
And you're a policeman.

00:28:23.721 --> 00:28:25.320
If I weren't a policeman,

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.280
would I have a chance?

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.800
I'm joking. Don't be so shocked.

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:41.481
I know we're not from the same world.

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.280
Why did you become a policeman?

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.280
I talked about this
with Little Qian before.

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:52.850
My parents

00:28:53.752 --> 00:28:56.520
always hoped I'd find an easier job.

00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.280
But being a policeman
is anything but easy.

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:01.320
It's really exhausting,

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.560
with no fixed holidays

00:29:04.401 --> 00:29:05.201
or high pay.

00:29:05.401 --> 00:29:06.481
Just look how broke I am.

00:29:08.441 --> 00:29:10.800
But later, I thought it over.

00:29:11.921 --> 00:29:14.424
Becoming a policeman
is absolutely the best choice

00:29:14.424 --> 00:29:16.312
I've made in over 20 years.

00:29:17.441 --> 00:29:19.800
The sense of achievement

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.881
from cracking a case

00:29:23.001 --> 00:29:24.721
with some clues

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:29.641
is something no amount
of money can ever buy.

00:29:43.201 --> 00:29:44.191
Get him to talk about

00:29:44.191 --> 00:29:46.800
that fight with Wu Da
in med school that got him demerits.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.001
Talk.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:58.961
That's because Wu Da
caught me peeking at Xiaole.

00:29:59.201 --> 00:30:01.040
He even suspected
I had an affair with Xiaole.

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:02.921
Then we got into a fight.

00:30:03.921 --> 00:30:06.800
But at least that day,

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:09.520
Xiaole finally knew about me.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:15.120
Honestly, I never meant
to disrupt their lives.

00:30:15.921 --> 00:30:18.320
I just wanted to watch over her quietly.

00:30:19.641 --> 00:30:23.320
At first, Wu Da seemed like
a decent boyfriend.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.641
He treated Xiaole well,

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.441
and seemed faithful.

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.961
But he just couldn't make it big.

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:34.600
He couldn't even hold a scalpel steady,

00:30:35.001 --> 00:30:36.520
so he couldn't become a doctor.

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:41.320
Seeing all those pharmaceutical reps
making big money,

00:30:41.921 --> 00:30:43.641
he can barely scrape by.

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:46.600
But poor Xiaole suffered,

00:30:48.001 --> 00:30:49.600
living in such a remote place.

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:56.560
Actually, he didn't buy
that second-hand apartment himself.

00:30:59.001 --> 00:30:59.961
(Wedding of Wu Da and Wang Xiaole)
Is this the place?

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:02.201
Welcome!

00:31:02.201 --> 00:31:02.800
Congrats!

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:03.704
- Happy wedding!
- Happy wedding!

00:31:03.704 --> 00:31:04.560
Come on in.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:05.161
Okay.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.280
Did Wu Da borrow money from you?

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:20.721
Yes.

00:31:20.721 --> 00:31:23.080
He asked every classmate
from high school.

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:24.840
Did you lend him?

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.600
It was a huge amount.

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:27.881
How could I possibly lend him?

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:29.201
Besides,

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.360
he even needs to borrow money

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:34.001
to buy that second-hand apartment
in Shancheng Community.

00:31:34.001 --> 00:31:35.560
He's really hit rock bottom.

00:31:35.961 --> 00:31:37.840
He asked me
and I didn't know what to do.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:38.481
You know?

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.080
Don't lend him.

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:50.681
Why would Wu Da even invite you
to his wedding with Wang Xiaole?

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.201
Wouldn't it be awkward
seeing each other?

00:31:56.961 --> 00:32:01.320
Their wedding was just Wu Da's scheme
to rake in cash gifts.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:04.681
He sent invitations to everyone,
friends or strangers.

00:32:05.481 --> 00:32:06.881
Lots of people showed up.

00:32:07.481 --> 00:32:09.201
Actually, we didn't even greet.

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.360
But I loved Xiaole.

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:14.280
I can't stand seeing
Xiaole suffer like this.

00:32:14.921 --> 00:32:16.681
I took out 200,000 yuan myself.

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:20.800
I got a classmate to lend it
to Wu Da in his name.

00:32:21.201 --> 00:32:22.161
Then what?

00:32:22.881 --> 00:32:24.984
You asked the hospital leadership

00:32:25.688 --> 00:32:30.080
to take on the task at the Dongyuan
Community Health Center, right?

00:32:30.681 --> 00:32:34.001
Just to get closer
to Wang Xiaole, right?

00:32:35.721 --> 00:32:36.520
Right?

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:39.921
Right.

00:32:40.881 --> 00:32:42.760
I didn't want to be too far from Xiaole.

00:32:44.001 --> 00:32:45.401
I don't trust Wu Da.

00:32:45.401 --> 00:32:46.881
He's too useless.

00:32:46.961 --> 00:32:48.080
Don't trust him?

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:52.600
So you went to peek at her

00:32:53.481 --> 00:32:56.001
and did that disgusting thing
up in a tree?

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:21.761
I love Xiaole.

00:35:22.401 --> 00:35:23.720
I truly love Xiaole.

00:35:23.761 --> 00:35:26.160
I haven't touched any woman
besides Xiaole.

00:35:28.321 --> 00:35:31.321
But I... But I am a normal man.

00:35:31.321 --> 00:35:34.120
Right? I have desires too.

00:35:35.801 --> 00:35:37.600
Like Nabokov said,

00:35:38.801 --> 00:35:40.560
Xiaole is my life's light,

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:42.680
my desire's fire.

00:35:43.961 --> 00:35:45.080
She is my goddess,

00:35:45.961 --> 00:35:46.961
my soul,

00:35:49.401 --> 00:35:50.560
and also my sin.

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.240
You're so shameless.

00:35:54.881 --> 00:35:56.200
This isn't about shame.

00:35:57.481 --> 00:35:58.801
It's beyond morality.

00:35:59.881 --> 00:36:01.080
This is love.

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:03.001
Because I truly love her.

00:36:04.761 --> 00:36:07.361
Xiaole was shining to me,

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.720
making everything else in the world dim.

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:12.801
All I can do is,

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:15.401
silently,

00:36:16.281 --> 00:36:17.080
secretly,

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:22.680
far away in a corner, to watch over her,

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:24.401
bless her,

00:36:25.441 --> 00:36:26.240
and love her.

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:54.881
It's been so long.

00:36:54.881 --> 00:36:55.881
She's late, right?

00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:58.281
If I were Chen Yumo,

00:36:58.281 --> 00:36:59.401
I'll just stand him up.

00:36:59.761 --> 00:37:02.881
Stand him up. Please.

00:37:04.184 --> 00:37:05.881
If I were meeting you, I'd be early.

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:09.200
We're waiting anyway.

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.921
Let's make a bet.

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.080
You learned some bad tricks.

00:37:14.881 --> 00:37:15.680
Bet on what?

00:37:16.401 --> 00:37:17.961
Bet on whether his crush shows up.

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:18.921
I bet she comes.

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:21.200
Then I bet she doesn't come.

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.080
Fine. If you lose,

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.080
promise me one thing.

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:25.001
If I lose,

00:37:26.321 --> 00:37:27.441
I'll do whatever you say.

00:37:28.761 --> 00:37:29.401
Deal.

00:37:29.801 --> 00:37:30.481
Deal.

00:37:30.481 --> 00:37:31.200
Deal.

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:46.520
Ye Qian.

00:38:19.761 --> 00:38:21.001
You got here early?

00:38:21.921 --> 00:38:23.281
You weren't here when I arrived,

00:38:23.401 --> 00:38:24.520
so I came in first.

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:27.401
Let's go in.

00:38:27.801 --> 00:38:28.361
Let's go.

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:57.841
M-My fault.

00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:59.200
I jinxed it.

00:39:01.281 --> 00:39:02.801
I'll go buy you qingbuliang.

00:39:03.361 --> 00:39:04.160
No.

00:39:06.441 --> 00:39:07.321
A bet's a bet.

00:39:08.024 --> 00:39:09.881
Just to be clear.
I can't be your girlfriend.

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:11.401
Relax. It's definitely not that.

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.881
I'll go buy you qingbuliang.

00:39:22.801 --> 00:39:23.921
Alright.

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:25.921
Let's talk about that.

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.281
On the night of the crime,

00:39:28.801 --> 00:39:32.040
what were you doing
between 12 AM to 1 AM?

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:34.001
Sleeping at home.

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:35.120
With whom?

00:39:36.361 --> 00:39:37.160
By myself.

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.120
Where do you live?

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:40.881
Guanlan Court.

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:45.640
Think it over.

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:48.441
No need.

00:39:49.281 --> 00:39:50.921
I'm a person with regular habits.

00:39:51.321 --> 00:39:53.976
I have clinic hours at the Dongyuan
Health Center every Wednesday

00:39:53.976 --> 00:39:55.321
just to go see Xiaole.

00:39:55.441 --> 00:39:56.720
The clinic closes at 5 PM,

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:57.921
and she's home by 6 PM.

00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:00.441
Then I went to the woods
and watched until 9:30 PM.

00:40:00.801 --> 00:40:01.720
I went home after that.

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:03.761
Quite regular.

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:15.921
Take a look.

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:21.600
Yours, right?

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:24.640
Explain it.

00:40:30.281 --> 00:40:32.080
About this question... I...

00:40:33.441 --> 00:40:35.560
I-I don't know how to answer.

00:40:35.761 --> 00:40:38.080
I did own an identical jacket
and the same bag.

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:40.080
But both items were stolen.

00:40:40.281 --> 00:40:41.040
Stolen?

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:42.720
Where were they stolen?

00:40:43.321 --> 00:40:44.120
Six months ago,

00:40:45.001 --> 00:40:48.040
I kept that jacket as a spare

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:51.520
in the locker room
at the Dongyuan Community.

00:40:51.761 --> 00:40:53.321
But my locker was pried open

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:54.921
and I couldn't find them.

00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:57.120
Some colleagues and the security guards

00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:58.200
can prove this.

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:01.881
Since the stolen items weren't valuable,
I didn't report it to the police.

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:14.040
Here. Qingbuliang.

00:41:15.441 --> 00:41:17.441
I heard their qingbuliang is delicious.

00:41:18.001 --> 00:41:18.640
Try some.

00:41:19.761 --> 00:41:21.040
Not in the mood.

00:41:35.441 --> 00:41:36.841
What kind of art exhibition?

00:41:36.841 --> 00:41:38.240
It takes that long?

00:41:42.001 --> 00:41:42.881
In my opinion,

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:47.600
Little Qian finally
got to see his unrequited love.

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:50.281
He must have
a lot of things to talk about

00:41:50.281 --> 00:41:51.160
and memories to share.

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:54.001
He must cherish
every single moment with her.

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:03.281
Hey, where are you going?
The night snack is on me.

00:42:05.281 --> 00:42:07.361
Wait, I came straight
after work to be with you.

00:42:07.361 --> 00:42:08.240
I put in efforts.

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.281
Don't be mad.
I'll treat you to late-night snacks.

00:42:10.361 --> 00:42:12.361
No. Too angry to eat.

00:42:12.401 --> 00:42:13.321
Where are you going?

00:42:13.401 --> 00:42:14.160
Going home.

00:42:16.761 --> 00:42:17.680
Let me accompany you.
