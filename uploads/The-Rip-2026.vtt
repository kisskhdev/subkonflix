WEBVTT

00:16.083 --> 00:18.208
How'd--
How'd it go in there with the feds?

00:22.875 --> 00:24.625
Y-You've spoken with our IA team?

00:25.750 --> 00:27.125
Several times, yes.

00:28.625 --> 00:30.291
And they found your alibi suitable?

00:51.041 --> 00:52.875
There are eyes everywhere.

00:52.958 --> 00:54.541
I know. I can feel them.

00:54.625 --> 00:57.541
You just need to know that
I'm the only cop you can trust.

00:59.791 --> 01:01.958
I don't feel like I have any protection.

01:02.041 --> 01:05.666
And like I'm being watched.
I feel like I shouldn't have called.

01:05.750 --> 01:09.083
It's good you called me. That was smart.

01:09.166 --> 01:12.000
I have the address now.
I know where you are.

01:12.083 --> 01:14.375
How do I know
they're not tracing this call?

01:14.458 --> 01:16.125
This is a burner phone. You're safe.

01:16.208 --> 01:19.000
No one will know you're speaking to me.
You'll be okay.

01:19.083 --> 01:21.333
No, no, no. I feel like they know.

01:21.416 --> 01:22.458
They don't know.

01:22.541 --> 01:25.875
You just keep answering the phone
and doing what they say. Okay?

01:30.208 --> 01:31.250
I'm scared.

01:31.333 --> 01:34.208
I don't know what to do.
And I want out. I want out of here.

01:34.291 --> 01:35.791
I will get to you.

01:35.875 --> 01:38.791
I'll protect you,
and I will pull you out of there.

01:38.875 --> 01:42.250
Okay? Don't trust anyone.

01:42.333 --> 01:44.791
Okay. Call me soon, please.

01:44.875 --> 01:45.958
Bye.

03:11.333 --> 03:13.291
They fucking killed Jackie, Thom.

03:17.166 --> 03:18.708
What was she chasing? Do you know?

03:21.416 --> 03:22.416
Money.

03:23.125 --> 03:25.250
I think. A lot of it.

03:25.333 --> 03:29.000
All right, I'm gonna level with you now,
Dane, because we're up against it.

03:29.083 --> 03:30.833
The-The division's falling apart.

03:31.416 --> 03:33.583
The feds, they want TNT dismantled.

03:33.666 --> 03:36.500
And look at us. It's turning us
into cannibals, for Christ's sake.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.166
-Take a seat, please, Detective Ro.
-Ro.

03:39.833 --> 03:42.416
There's been some developments,
and we want to keep pushing,

03:42.500 --> 03:44.916
so we have a few more questions,
if you don't mind.

03:45.583 --> 03:48.833
How would you describe
your relationship with Captain Velez?

03:50.583 --> 03:51.750
She was my friend.

03:52.916 --> 03:53.916
And my bitch.

03:54.791 --> 03:55.958
She had my back.

03:56.541 --> 03:58.000
She looked after me.

03:58.500 --> 04:03.333
-And has her death in any way…?
-No, no, let's not "her death"…

04:03.833 --> 04:05.500
And let's "her murder."

04:06.000 --> 04:08.416
She was murdered.
Let's keep it real. Let's keep it a bean.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.208
And how's that make you feel?

04:13.500 --> 04:15.333
Shit makes me sick to my stomach.

04:15.833 --> 04:19.250
Detective Salazar, we're re-interviewing
your entire TNT team.

04:19.333 --> 04:20.375
No, it's…

04:20.958 --> 04:21.958
It's just TNT.

04:22.791 --> 04:26.291
Tactical Narcotics Team.
It's not "Tactical Narcotics Team Team."

04:28.875 --> 04:32.666
All right, last time we spoke,
you described the job as follows:

04:32.750 --> 04:34.583
"TNT works the dope game."

04:34.666 --> 04:38.250
"We jump the hole,
seizures, drugs, guns, mostly cash."

04:39.250 --> 04:40.375
Is that accurate?

04:41.166 --> 04:42.166
That's correct.

04:44.041 --> 04:45.083
Mostly cash.

04:45.958 --> 04:47.041
Does that create conflict?

04:49.125 --> 04:51.166
Conflict? What do you…
What do you mean?

04:51.250 --> 04:53.333
Like we steal the money ourselves? No.

04:53.416 --> 04:54.916
Those thoughts never cross your mind?

04:56.208 --> 04:57.958
You heard about the inside heist teams?

04:58.708 --> 05:01.541
Innuendo to that end, yeah.
Cops playing robbers, yeah.

05:01.625 --> 05:04.541
And working with other
corrupt law enforcement elements.

05:13.583 --> 05:17.458
When's the last time you guys caught
a cop killer in a conference room?

05:17.541 --> 05:18.541
I'm curious.

05:20.041 --> 05:22.791
What's the play today, guys?
Besides trying to dirty up some cops.

05:23.583 --> 05:27.208
That's probably the easiest work you can
get right now in the city of Miami.

05:30.250 --> 05:32.875
Are you gonna look me
in the eye and tell me

05:32.958 --> 05:35.000
that you think somebody
in TNT killed Jackie?

05:35.083 --> 05:37.208
I didn't say that. Did I say that?

05:37.291 --> 05:38.666
Then what is this?

05:38.750 --> 05:40.666
This is fucking Hail Mary bullshit.

05:40.750 --> 05:43.208
Trying to put this together
with popsicle sticks and glue.

05:43.291 --> 05:44.166
What the fuck is happening?

05:44.250 --> 05:46.500
Where's the…
Where's the fucking task force?

05:46.583 --> 05:48.708
-Why hasn't the world stopped?
-Dane…

05:48.791 --> 05:50.875
No, I don't get it.
I really don't. It makes no sense.

05:52.291 --> 05:53.708
Thom, you got a dead…

05:54.791 --> 05:56.541
Miami police captain.

05:56.625 --> 05:59.708
Because you guys blew it.
Can't catch a cop killer.

06:00.541 --> 06:02.583
Maybe that's because the killer is a cop.

06:03.083 --> 06:03.916
Christ.

06:07.083 --> 06:09.791
-You wanna put the cigarette out?
-No, I don't.

06:10.791 --> 06:12.125
-What else?
-All right.

06:14.291 --> 06:18.000
So far, we've interviewed
Baptiste, Salazar, Ro.

06:18.583 --> 06:20.833
We've interviewed your current commander.

06:20.916 --> 06:23.458
You know, the guy that just took
your promotion, Dane Dumars.

06:23.541 --> 06:26.208
Who deserved that bump as much
as anybody in this department.

06:26.708 --> 06:30.083
You aware of what that guy's been through?
His marriage, his kid?

06:30.166 --> 06:31.500
You two are close?

06:31.583 --> 06:34.166
Very. Which is why I don't sit around
and piss and moan

06:34.250 --> 06:37.708
about him getting fucking promoted.
Because Dane works for a living.

06:38.208 --> 06:39.041
-Like I do.
-Right.

06:39.125 --> 06:40.750
By the way, that was your bosses.

06:40.833 --> 06:43.916
Your fucking genius brain trust
that helped bust up VCAT.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.666
-VCAT? I'm not familiar…
-Violent Criminal Apprehension Team.

06:46.750 --> 06:48.250
And the reason they were shut down

06:48.333 --> 06:51.291
was because of widespread
and rampant criminal corruption.

06:51.375 --> 06:53.083
Not a lot of straight-A students.

06:53.708 --> 06:55.750
But superb fucking murder police.

06:56.708 --> 06:59.083
And you guys fucking torched the place.

06:59.166 --> 07:01.208
Which further
hamstrings Jackie's investigation

07:01.291 --> 07:03.291
because now all the VCAT guys,

07:03.375 --> 07:06.708
not just the bent ones,
are buried fucking alive.

07:06.791 --> 07:08.375
Are they approving any overtime?

07:08.458 --> 07:10.875
No, Dane, no. God, no.
Not with budgets, too.

07:10.958 --> 07:12.375
It's not a hill
anyone's willing to die on.

07:12.458 --> 07:15.083
And VCAT being shut down
has really hurt us.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.125
All right, so let us run it.

07:24.791 --> 07:26.333
-No.
-We'll run it off hours.

07:26.416 --> 07:29.041
Dane, if they got wind
that TNT was conducting

07:29.125 --> 07:31.583
a clandestine investigation
of their own captain's murder,

07:31.666 --> 07:34.208
they'd burn us at the stake
and feed the feds a barbecue.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.166
Were you and Captain Velez close?

07:40.375 --> 07:42.083
Were you in a relationship?

07:44.833 --> 07:46.458
You gonna answer the question?

07:50.833 --> 07:52.250
Is this what we're doing now?

07:54.583 --> 07:55.500
Cat got your tongue?

07:55.583 --> 07:57.208
-You fucking cunt.
-You'll say shit to anyone, right?

07:57.291 --> 07:59.791
-I called him a cunt. Write it down.
-You got nothing to say now, J.D.?

07:59.875 --> 08:02.250
You're a cunt.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.291
Are you fucking bozos here
because you think Jackie was dirty?

08:13.791 --> 08:14.708
Was she?

08:16.375 --> 08:17.583
Be very careful, Del.

08:18.208 --> 08:19.375
Fuck you.

08:22.166 --> 08:23.083
Let's not pretend

08:23.166 --> 08:25.833
that you don't have a huge
personal stake in this, because you do.

08:25.916 --> 08:27.166
All right? I know you do.

08:28.791 --> 08:30.333
Everybody fucking knows you do.

08:38.666 --> 08:39.833
So why don't you tell us

08:39.916 --> 08:43.500
about that double-shoulder rig
you're wearing there, Wild West, huh?

08:44.916 --> 08:46.250
You a fucking cowboy?

08:47.291 --> 08:49.791
One of those guns is yours, right?
Who's the other belong to?

09:01.250 --> 09:02.708
And what are you gonna do with it?

09:03.125 --> 09:04.375
-Fuck you.
-What's wrong with you?

09:04.458 --> 09:05.791
-Hey! Hey!
-Fucking piece of shit!

09:05.875 --> 09:07.083
Fuck off.

09:09.875 --> 09:12.750
-You fucking cunt! Fuck you!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

09:15.500 --> 09:16.625
What the fuck is he doing?

09:17.208 --> 09:18.833
He's fighting with his brother.

09:18.916 --> 09:19.833
Hey, hey, hey!

09:19.916 --> 09:22.708
-Come on, stop!
-Get the fuck off me!

09:23.333 --> 09:24.375
Get him the fuck out of here!

09:24.458 --> 09:26.500
What the fuck, man?
You're a fucking bully!

09:26.583 --> 09:28.000
Yeah, his brother's a fed.

09:29.375 --> 09:30.416
Jesus Christ.

09:37.583 --> 09:40.916
Hey, so you saw your brother.
How'd that go?

09:42.416 --> 09:44.000
Well, he's still an asshole.

09:44.708 --> 09:47.041
You know,
it's like the same fucking thing.

09:47.125 --> 09:49.041
Look, you want to have
a conversation with me,

09:49.125 --> 09:50.500
have a conversation with me.

09:50.583 --> 09:53.625
The guy became a fed so he could
talk down to people. I'm convinced.

09:55.041 --> 09:57.250
Well, was he hoping for a confession?

09:57.333 --> 09:59.458
No, I don't know
what anybody's hoping for right now.

10:01.125 --> 10:02.208
This is bad, Dane.

10:02.958 --> 10:05.666
If they're here, after all this time,
looking at us,

10:05.750 --> 10:08.083
it means they have no fucking idea.

10:08.166 --> 10:12.000
-Jackie's basically an afterthought.
-She's not even that. I mean…

10:13.916 --> 10:15.125
I don't think they're gonna clear it.

10:15.875 --> 10:18.791
Have a funeral,
fold the flag for your family,

10:18.875 --> 10:21.250
and fuck you. Thanks for your service.

10:21.333 --> 10:22.916
Either they think Jackie's dirty

10:23.000 --> 10:24.625
or they think we had
something to do with it.

10:24.708 --> 10:26.916
Yeah, or both.
Or they have no fucking idea.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.125
It's the easiest place to lay it on.
Just hang it on a dirty cop.

10:32.041 --> 10:35.541
What did fucking Thom
with an H have to say?

10:37.000 --> 10:39.666
That guy just got his dick
knocked in by the grind, man.

10:39.750 --> 10:41.916
He's done. He's not gonna help us.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.458
Everybody's got a fucking excuse.
We're all working hard.

10:44.541 --> 10:46.333
It's a job. Go out and fucking do it.

10:46.416 --> 10:48.291
If it's me, I throw chum in the water.

10:48.375 --> 10:51.750
I fucking shake it up. I yank the line.
I see what comes to the fucking surface.

10:51.833 --> 10:54.625
-You know what I mean?
-Exactly. You get some fucking movement.

10:54.708 --> 10:57.583
Fucking see who starts talking,
see who starts making mistakes.

10:57.666 --> 11:00.708
-Some fucking cop shit.
-Just fucking basic shit, man.

11:06.416 --> 11:09.250
I hate it here now, man. I hate it.

11:12.541 --> 11:13.875
I hate being a cop.

11:20.916 --> 11:22.041
I've been waking up

11:23.250 --> 11:24.250
every night

11:25.250 --> 11:26.125
like…

11:27.625 --> 11:28.916
thinking about time.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
It's like how much has passed
and how much I got left.

11:38.166 --> 11:39.875
What the fuck I'm gonna do with it.

11:42.958 --> 11:44.166
It's not fair.

11:47.375 --> 11:48.833
I don't know what to tell you.

11:50.291 --> 11:53.750
Maybe it's that shit Jackie
used to say, I always made fun of, like,

11:53.833 --> 11:56.083
"Well, just live to see another sunrise."

11:56.166 --> 11:59.583
Maybe that was the whole key to life.
"Just live to see another sunrise."

11:59.666 --> 12:02.833
Jackie… believed in witches, man.

12:03.333 --> 12:07.625
You're the problem with the
culture of the police department today.

12:07.708 --> 12:11.708
It's this kind of judgment.
A lot of people believe in witches and…

12:11.791 --> 12:13.666
Jackie believed in spirit animals.

12:14.333 --> 12:17.708
Yeah, I used to like your fucking spirit.
Let's go get cranked.

12:17.791 --> 12:19.750
-What do you say?
-I'm coming. I'm coming.

12:33.125 --> 12:36.000
Keep the donuts going, boys. Yeah!

12:39.625 --> 12:42.500
Do we have spare fucking tires?
Hey, guys, chill out.

12:42.583 --> 12:44.166
-Ho!
-Hell, yeah.

12:46.375 --> 12:47.500
The champ is here.

12:48.750 --> 12:49.625
The champ is here.

12:49.708 --> 12:52.750
Can we not be doing this dumb shit
in the fucking parking lot like idiots?

12:52.833 --> 12:54.208
It's not high school.

12:55.458 --> 12:58.958
I was gonna bet on your brother,
but we broke it up too fast.

12:59.708 --> 13:01.458
Wouldn't be the first bad bet you made.

13:02.166 --> 13:03.916
"You're a bully!"

13:05.291 --> 13:06.416
Who the fuck says that?

13:06.500 --> 13:09.375
No, on some real shit, though.
What is going on with this cash?

13:09.458 --> 13:11.083
Everything is just money, money, money.

13:11.166 --> 13:14.166
You know, we dope cops,
so I'm trying to make this make sense.

13:14.250 --> 13:17.166
You think it's those stash house hits
we've been hearing about?

13:17.250 --> 13:19.708
-What the hell are those?
-Some bullshit.

13:19.791 --> 13:22.750
It's cartel houses supposedly
getting knocked over by cops and feds,

13:22.833 --> 13:25.666
money disappears…
Heist teams are an urban fantasy.

13:25.750 --> 13:28.750
You run into a big fucking stash house,
you let me know. Okay?

14:17.041 --> 14:18.000
Okay, buddy?

14:20.833 --> 14:22.666
Look at this shit.

14:22.750 --> 14:24.166
Roll up in a fucking tank.

14:24.250 --> 14:26.208
When's the last time you had to arrest
somebody and you needed a tank?

14:27.166 --> 14:30.333
See, this is the kind of shit
I like. Big tanks, big wheels.

14:30.416 --> 14:31.625
You like that?

14:31.708 --> 14:33.083
But small guy.

14:33.166 --> 14:34.958
Look at that jump.

14:38.083 --> 14:41.208
It's unbelievable, the fucking artillery
and the machine guns. Okay.

14:41.791 --> 14:43.458
-Hey.
-Captain America!

14:44.125 --> 14:46.416
You get the Red Skull yet?

14:50.250 --> 14:52.333
Dude, DEA doesn't have
their own staging area?

14:52.416 --> 14:54.833
You're always using our parking lot
for your fucking armada.

14:54.916 --> 14:57.291
I'm bestowing overtime
on my former brethren in blue

14:57.375 --> 14:59.541
so they can make
their fucking mortgage payments.

14:59.625 --> 15:00.541
Oh, I see.

15:00.625 --> 15:03.625
Maybe this is the motherfucker
knocking over the stash houses

15:03.708 --> 15:06.666
with the cabal of Miami's finest
and feds put together.

15:06.750 --> 15:08.958
I'm DEA, Byrne,
so that makes me Miami's finest.

15:09.041 --> 15:11.541
Ask your fucking crooked cops
you socialize with.

15:11.625 --> 15:13.791
-Y'all look fucking dirty.
-I look fucking good.

15:13.875 --> 15:16.500
-Not you.
-Dayo. What's up, cabrón?

15:16.583 --> 15:18.791
What's up?
What's hot on the streets, hoes?

15:18.875 --> 15:21.041
And what? Are things any better?

15:21.125 --> 15:22.958
Until they catch our cop killer, no.

15:23.041 --> 15:24.041
Dominoes, motherfucker!

15:24.125 --> 15:26.833
You know, I really fucking feel
like they trying to fire us.

15:26.916 --> 15:28.916
They on our ass
and I don't like it one bit.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.916
They're not gonna let
a cop's body get cold,

15:31.000 --> 15:34.125
especially a captain who'll blow
a big-time media frenzy murder case.

15:34.208 --> 15:37.208
If VCAT didn't get disbanded,
arrest would have happened by now.

15:37.291 --> 15:39.875
Oh, yeah? What's DEA doing for us,
just out of curiosity?

15:39.958 --> 15:41.250
-Nada.
-Nada.

15:41.333 --> 15:42.583
-Well, come on.
-Not a fucking thing.

15:42.666 --> 15:44.541
It's not our fucking
front porch, now, is it?

15:44.625 --> 15:46.666
-Handle your scandal, officers.
-Okay.

15:46.750 --> 15:48.541
I'll keep that in mind
when you get fucked up.

15:48.625 --> 15:51.166
I'll tell you this. There's fucking
snitches in every division.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.791
Speaking of which,
you look a little snitchy.

16:05.625 --> 16:07.458
Oh, fuck. There he is. Look at that.

16:07.541 --> 16:09.500
The most corrupt cop
in all of fucking Dade.

16:09.583 --> 16:10.708
-Hi, Matty.
-Second!

16:10.791 --> 16:12.708
-How's it going, man?
-Trying to find a fuck to give.

16:12.791 --> 16:13.916
What's up, L.T.?

16:14.000 --> 16:18.083
Okay. Hey, TFOs, let's go.
You wanna make some money today or what?

16:18.166 --> 16:20.625
What are you fucking doing?
You playing fucking dominoes?

16:20.708 --> 16:22.583
We had a Crimestopper tip come in.

16:22.666 --> 16:24.333
-Just now?
-Yep.

16:25.083 --> 16:26.291
It's a quarter past quitting time.

16:26.375 --> 16:28.000
It's money up in a house in Hialeah.

16:28.083 --> 16:30.125
I wanna rip it.
Don't wanna end the week on a goose egg.

16:30.208 --> 16:32.875
-Overtime?
-No. This is extra credit.

16:32.958 --> 16:34.458
I need Wilbur, too.

16:34.541 --> 16:38.166
-L.T., come on, man. No overtime? Why?
-Budgets. I can't do it.

16:38.250 --> 16:40.083
So they get
to just fucking pay their bills,

16:40.166 --> 16:42.958
and we don't get to fucking pay our bills?
Make it make sense.

16:43.041 --> 16:45.750
I'm going regardless,
so do what you want, but I do need Wilbur.

16:45.833 --> 16:48.083
We need a money dog.
Take your own cars. Follow me out.

16:48.166 --> 16:51.375
-That's fucked up.
-He's asleep in my fucking car. Fuck.

16:52.208 --> 16:53.166
Yo!

16:54.750 --> 16:56.375
How much they said was in here?

16:56.875 --> 16:58.833
Don't know. 250 maybe?

16:58.916 --> 17:00.583
Word? Oh, shit.

17:01.458 --> 17:03.500
All right, bet. That's fucking easy rip.

17:03.583 --> 17:05.083
-Friday night?
-Yep.

17:06.625 --> 17:08.375
L.T. Hey.

17:09.083 --> 17:11.583
You mentioned Hialeah.
So we wanna get local PD involved?

17:11.666 --> 17:14.208
Absolutely not.
That entire department's upside down.

17:14.291 --> 17:16.041
How much is this rip supposed to be?

17:16.125 --> 17:17.583
-150K.
-A doper?

17:17.666 --> 17:19.666
Detective, can you sense
my patience fraying

17:19.750 --> 17:21.458
in real fucking time
from these questions?

17:21.541 --> 17:24.041
Sorry, my bad. Force of habit.

18:18.625 --> 18:20.333
All right, what do we tell 'em?

18:22.083 --> 18:23.208
A lie.

18:24.750 --> 18:26.958
Fucking houses all look abandoned.

18:27.041 --> 18:30.166
Get them to sign a consent to search
for dope instead of money.

18:30.250 --> 18:33.666
Yeah, we out here looking like a goddamn
Halloween costume for cops.

18:33.750 --> 18:35.791
What the hell going on?
Ain't it supposed to be a madhouse?

18:35.875 --> 18:38.083
What if they don't sign
because it actually is a dope hole?

18:38.166 --> 18:41.125
Well, then it's a protective search.
We clear the place anyway.

18:45.125 --> 18:46.791
Wilbur, come on, baby.

18:51.541 --> 18:53.583
Good boy, Wilbur. Good boy.

18:53.666 --> 18:54.875
What do we got?

18:54.958 --> 18:57.958
I've never seen him alert like this, boss.
He's going crazy.

18:58.833 --> 19:00.166
How much are they holding?

19:00.666 --> 19:01.666
75 grand.

19:01.750 --> 19:03.875
That's impossible.
He's peeing all over the house.

19:03.958 --> 19:06.083
There has to be a lot more money inside.

19:10.166 --> 19:11.625
Knock, knock. Miami PD.

19:15.625 --> 19:17.875
-Knock, knock.
-How you doing this evening, miss?

19:18.625 --> 19:22.125
Well, five cops magically appear
at my doorstep. I've been better.

19:22.875 --> 19:25.416
We had a Crimestopper tip
come in on this address.

19:25.500 --> 19:28.541
-A what stopper? What?
-It's called a Crimestopper tip.

19:28.625 --> 19:30.708
Said maybe there's some narcotics
on the premises.

19:30.791 --> 19:34.083
They're typically pretty reliable,
so we just gotta follow up.

19:34.166 --> 19:36.583
What's your name?

19:36.666 --> 19:37.500
Desi.

19:38.083 --> 19:40.250
That's your rock star name.
What's your full legal name?

19:43.125 --> 19:44.583
Desiree Lopez Molina.

19:44.666 --> 19:46.458
Do you have any ID? Driver's license?

19:46.541 --> 19:47.500
Inside.

19:47.583 --> 19:49.541
-Any animals in the house? Pets?
-Just me.

19:49.625 --> 19:50.625
You alone here?

19:51.166 --> 19:52.000
Just me.

19:52.583 --> 19:54.250
Do you mind if we come inside?

19:55.250 --> 19:57.791
-Do you have a warrant?
-We have a consent to search.

19:57.875 --> 19:59.041
What's the difference?

19:59.125 --> 20:03.166
The difference is we don't need a judge
to sign and approve a consent to search.

20:03.250 --> 20:04.541
So I can say no.

20:05.208 --> 20:07.500
-You can say no. Sure.
-And what would you say to that?

20:08.000 --> 20:10.166
Well, you would have to say no first.

20:13.666 --> 20:15.125
I don't have drugs in here.

20:15.208 --> 20:17.375
-Maybe a bit of weed.
-You don't have to worry about that.

20:17.458 --> 20:20.625
Sign the paper and we'll be in and out.
We want to go home, too.

20:23.875 --> 20:25.583
Don't do any of that pushy cop shit,
all right?

20:25.666 --> 20:28.958
What? Do I look like a pushy cop?
These guys are the pushy cops.

20:29.041 --> 20:31.375
Trust me.
That's who you don't want to fuck with.

20:33.541 --> 20:34.500
Yeah, we're good.

20:35.666 --> 20:36.958
What the fuck, guys?

20:38.541 --> 20:40.458
Come on, Wilbur.

20:40.541 --> 20:43.583
That's that pushy cop shit
I was talking about.

20:43.666 --> 20:45.500
Get it. Get it. Let's go.

20:47.625 --> 20:49.916
All right, Numa, go long. Mike, go right.

20:53.375 --> 20:55.291
Come on.

20:55.375 --> 20:56.750
Stay right by me.

21:00.500 --> 21:02.916
I'm letting him off leash.

21:03.750 --> 21:04.583
Go. Go.

21:22.041 --> 21:24.166
Is there anybody else in this house, Desi?

21:24.250 --> 21:25.125
Just me.

21:25.208 --> 21:28.250
The last thing you want to do
is lie to us right now.

21:28.333 --> 21:29.625
Promise, just me.

21:30.750 --> 21:33.000
All right, Wilbur, down! Shh! Wilbur.

21:33.958 --> 21:35.500
-Lolo, come get the dog.
-Clear.

21:35.583 --> 21:37.333
It's okay. Stop.

21:37.416 --> 21:39.250
Hey, what's in this attic, Desi?
What's up there?

21:39.333 --> 21:41.125
-Come on, come on.
-Don't know. Never been.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.125
I already told you,
I don't have any drugs.

21:44.208 --> 21:46.041
Dog doesn't alert for drugs.
Alerts for money.

21:51.458 --> 21:53.541
I-I think I'm going to need
that warrant now.

21:54.125 --> 21:55.458
Nah, dog alerted to something.

21:55.541 --> 21:57.625
We don't need a warrant.
We got probable cause.

21:57.708 --> 21:59.625
Desi, is there anybody in the attic?

21:59.708 --> 22:00.666
No.

22:00.750 --> 22:02.583
-Okay, go.
-Clear.

22:41.291 --> 22:42.416
Desi?

22:43.083 --> 22:43.958
Yeah?

22:44.583 --> 22:46.416
Why is this attic so clean?

22:47.458 --> 22:51.083
I already said, I don't know.
Never been up there.

22:51.791 --> 22:53.125
Why does it matter?

22:53.750 --> 22:55.833
Well, 'cause the rest of your house
looks like a fucking landfill,

22:55.916 --> 22:57.125
and this is spotless.

22:57.208 --> 22:59.958
You should have seen this place
before I started cleaning it up.

23:00.041 --> 23:02.541
Mi abuela, she just
never threw anything away.

23:03.916 --> 23:05.291
Hey, look at this.

23:06.250 --> 23:08.666
Electrical wire
shouldn't be sticking out like that.

23:27.250 --> 23:28.583
What the fuck is that?

23:40.833 --> 23:42.041
All right, get the sledge.

23:43.833 --> 23:46.625
All right, so how long
have you lived here, Desi?

23:46.708 --> 23:47.791
Two months.

23:48.583 --> 23:51.208
And you mentioned your abuela,
is she still around?

23:53.208 --> 23:55.000
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

23:55.083 --> 23:56.791
She passed away in June.

23:56.875 --> 23:58.875
I had been taking care of her
the last few years.

23:58.958 --> 24:00.833
-By yourself?
-Yeah.

24:01.333 --> 24:03.958
-Do you work?
-House is in probate.

24:04.041 --> 24:05.916
I've been fighting my sister for it.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.500
Bitch didn't lift a finger
for our grandmother,

24:07.583 --> 24:08.916
and now she wants to contest her will.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.125
Rest of the house is clear.

24:10.208 --> 24:12.916
So, Desi,
before we get into that wall up there,

24:13.000 --> 24:15.500
anything you want to tell us?
Maybe get ahead of it.

24:17.250 --> 24:20.250
I actually really do not know
what's up there.

24:21.416 --> 24:23.333
I swear on all I love.

24:23.416 --> 24:24.708
I'm telling the truth.

24:24.791 --> 24:27.208
I'd like to believe you, Desi,
but I've been doing this a long time,

24:27.291 --> 24:29.125
and when I told you
the dog alerts for money,

24:29.208 --> 24:31.583
I saw the look on your face,
and you were shook.

24:32.375 --> 24:34.166
What do you think is behind the wall?

24:36.625 --> 24:38.541
You guys brought a dog
that can smell money.

24:39.875 --> 24:43.041
So, I mean, it's highly likely that
you know a lot more than I do, right?

24:43.125 --> 24:44.208
Come on, Desi.

24:44.708 --> 24:48.333
You got a Colombian flag hanging over
the fireplace downstairs, and we're cops,

24:48.416 --> 24:51.541
so it kind of takes the mystery out
of who the money might belong to.

24:51.625 --> 24:53.750
Oh, that's real small-minded of you.

24:54.791 --> 24:57.250
-All Colombians aren't the same, you know?
-We're aware.

24:57.791 --> 24:59.250
But they do have great coke.

24:59.333 --> 25:00.750
In fact, all the coke
in the United States is Colombian.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.958
-And they have great food, too. Yeah.
-I'm sure they do.

25:03.041 --> 25:05.583
-They do.
-But they don't hide it in the wall.

25:09.125 --> 25:11.250
All you cops have the same look
on your face.

25:12.500 --> 25:15.041
The one that makes you feel like
you've done something wrong.

25:15.125 --> 25:17.250
-Did you do something wrong?
-I didn't.

25:17.333 --> 25:21.000
The receipt of stolen property,
knowingly or unknowingly, including cash,

25:21.083 --> 25:24.208
does actually constitute doing something
very seriously wrong.

25:24.291 --> 25:27.916
Desi, not seeing a crime does not
exonerate you from its commission.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.875
-Not if it's in your fucking house.
-You understand?

25:30.958 --> 25:32.916
Right, but it's not my home.

25:34.375 --> 25:36.208
This is my grandmother's house, remember?

25:36.916 --> 25:39.458
-Her estate is still in probate.
-Oh, yeah.

25:41.250 --> 25:42.875
That's pretty slick, Desi.

25:44.166 --> 25:45.500
Who gave you that loophole?

25:51.333 --> 25:52.833
Come on.

25:53.958 --> 25:56.500
I mean, we all love to
lecture and moralize, don't we?

25:57.333 --> 25:58.625
Make better decisions.

25:59.458 --> 26:01.250
Live a more honest life.

26:02.666 --> 26:04.541
Leave it in God's hands.

26:05.625 --> 26:08.208
But God isn't gonna
make the mortgage, is he?

26:09.666 --> 26:11.500
End of the month, bills are due.

26:12.583 --> 26:13.916
Medical bills.

26:14.708 --> 26:16.000
Lawyer fees.

26:16.875 --> 26:18.625
Funeral costs.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.125
So tell me…

26:23.041 --> 26:24.875
can you trade all that advice…

26:25.500 --> 26:27.416
and prayer and good intention…

26:27.958 --> 26:29.166
for cash?

26:31.375 --> 26:34.000
No, I guess not. Desi, I guess not.

26:37.958 --> 26:40.291
A-W-T-G-G.

26:41.791 --> 26:42.666
What does it mean?

26:44.416 --> 26:45.875
Are we the good guys?

26:47.458 --> 26:49.083
Do you need validation
that you're a good guy?

26:54.791 --> 26:55.958
Okay, sorry.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.708
How about the other one? W-A-A-W-B?

27:01.833 --> 27:03.250
We are and always will be.

27:05.375 --> 27:06.375
What are they?

27:06.458 --> 27:08.041
L.T. Bling bling!

27:12.125 --> 27:15.041
-What do you got?
-I don't know. But it looks big.

27:18.250 --> 27:19.958
Keep an eye on her.
Don't let her go anywhere.

27:24.083 --> 27:25.458
This is fucking crazy.

27:26.750 --> 27:28.291
Fucking boom.

27:38.875 --> 27:40.083
The fuck?

27:40.166 --> 27:41.875
Oh, shit.

27:50.750 --> 27:51.583
Oh, shit…

27:54.541 --> 27:55.458
Goddamn.

27:55.541 --> 27:57.583
There's $1.4 million in this bucket.

27:57.666 --> 27:59.166
That can't be. Is that real?

27:59.250 --> 28:01.666
-What's that noise? It's big?
-Shit. Damn.

28:02.250 --> 28:04.833
I eyeball 14 more
of those things at least.

28:04.916 --> 28:06.833
-Oh, God.
-But that's… if they average…

28:06.916 --> 28:08.041
Even more up there.

28:08.125 --> 28:09.541
That's a $20 million Rip.

28:10.291 --> 28:12.083
You ever seen this before?
What the fuck do we do?

28:12.166 --> 28:13.791
Hold on.
Just fucking hold on for a second.

28:13.875 --> 28:15.041
Give me just…

28:18.166 --> 28:19.791
All right, guys. You know what?
Just… Can you step…

28:19.875 --> 28:21.333
Step downstairs for a sec.
Give us a second.

28:21.416 --> 28:23.541
-Huh?
-Give us one sec. We'll be right there.

28:23.625 --> 28:25.375
Just… Let the L.T. just…

28:26.416 --> 28:28.541
Fuck, dude.

28:28.625 --> 28:29.708
You know what this means, right?

28:30.916 --> 28:31.916
Jesus Christ, dude.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.333
Hey, hey, phones.

28:33.833 --> 28:34.958
-Phones.
-What?

28:35.583 --> 28:36.750
What do you mean, our phones?

28:36.833 --> 28:38.500
I don't want anybody calling now.

28:38.583 --> 28:39.833
Give me your phones. Pass them up.

28:39.916 --> 28:40.750
Hand your phone up.

28:40.833 --> 28:42.041
-Dane, what are you doing?
-Hand your phone up.

28:42.125 --> 28:43.166
You don't trust us, boss?

28:43.250 --> 28:45.750
No, look, it's not--
I don't trust this fucking Rip, all right?

28:45.833 --> 28:47.500
Money like this does fucked-up shit.

28:47.583 --> 28:50.041
Just turn your pockets inside out.
I want your phones.

28:50.125 --> 28:52.000
It's the fucking Rip, Numa. It's not you.

28:52.083 --> 28:54.166
-Lolo, I need your phone.
-Okay.

28:54.791 --> 28:57.666
-Hand it up.
-You're not a dirty cop, are you?

28:57.750 --> 28:59.958
-I want everything. I want burners, 33s.
-I don't have burners.

29:00.041 --> 29:01.083
-Seriously?
-Dane, what are you doing?

29:01.166 --> 29:03.541
Let me get Lolo's phone.
I want Desi's phone, too.

29:03.625 --> 29:06.208
-I want to do a rapid I.D.
-Give me your phone.

29:06.750 --> 29:08.416
-Really?
-Yes, give me your phone.

29:08.500 --> 29:10.000
-Are you serious?
-Hand me your phone.

29:10.083 --> 29:11.083
L.T. It's…

29:11.166 --> 29:12.291
One more, one more.

29:12.375 --> 29:14.708
Hey, stop with the long fucking faces,
guys, all right?

29:14.791 --> 29:16.083
It's not a fucking purity test.

29:16.166 --> 29:19.083
I'm dealing with a fucking situation here.
I'm trying to get a handle on it.

29:20.833 --> 29:21.833
You want my phone, too, man?

29:21.916 --> 29:23.250
No, I don't want your fucking phone.

29:23.333 --> 29:25.333
I want you to help me figure out
what the fuck this is.

29:25.416 --> 29:26.541
Let's not start undermining our trust
in our fucking team…

29:26.625 --> 29:28.750
Don't fucking tell me
what I can and can't do right now.

29:28.833 --> 29:31.916
I'm fucking reacting, all right? I'm not
worried about fucking offending the team.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.958
All right, we gotta be smart now.
This is about trust.

29:34.041 --> 29:38.208
-Yes, yes.
-Dude, dude, it's me and you, okay?

29:39.416 --> 29:41.791
How much was the tip that came in?

29:42.750 --> 29:44.208
It said 300 grand.

29:44.750 --> 29:46.708
The Crimestopper tip
that just got called in said 300?

29:46.791 --> 29:48.333
300, 300.

29:49.333 --> 29:50.583
Fuck.

29:52.625 --> 29:54.750
-All right, we're in trouble, J.D.
-Yeah.

29:55.583 --> 29:56.416
A lot.

29:58.250 --> 30:00.541
Okay, I want to tear out the rest
of these containers from the wall.

30:00.625 --> 30:01.791
We gotta prep a count right now.

30:01.875 --> 30:04.541
Mike, I want you to help Numa take them
into the garage, all right?

30:04.625 --> 30:06.208
Because this is
all just drywall and plaster.

30:06.291 --> 30:07.166
Why does that matter?

30:07.250 --> 30:10.500
It's harder for a bullet to travel through
cinder block. That's why.

30:10.583 --> 30:11.416
-Shit.
-Fuck.

30:11.500 --> 30:13.083
-It's like that?
-It's exactly like that.

30:13.166 --> 30:14.250
Please, just get it done.

30:14.333 --> 30:16.000
Hey, man. Hey, Dane.

30:16.083 --> 30:17.291
You gotta move this money, man.

30:18.291 --> 30:19.166
No, I can't.

30:19.250 --> 30:22.000
The rules are you count the money
at the site of the seizure.

30:22.083 --> 30:23.666
-That's the fucking law, man.
-The rules, all right,

30:23.750 --> 30:25.125
that doesn't apply to
a cubic ton of fucking cash, dude.

30:25.208 --> 30:28.416
If we fuck this count up by one dollar,
IA is fucking up our ass.

30:28.500 --> 30:30.750
Looking for asylum
if we fucking get this count wrong.

30:30.833 --> 30:33.708
No, I'm not
not following procedure right now, man.

30:33.791 --> 30:35.750
We gotta fucking count the money here.

30:35.833 --> 30:36.833
All right, so we call the Major.

30:42.041 --> 30:43.791
-Do you want to involve him?
-No, I don't want to fucking involve him.

30:43.875 --> 30:45.125
You're talking about following protocol.
We can't pick and choose.

30:45.208 --> 30:47.416
-Do you trust our command structure?
-Not particularly.

30:47.500 --> 30:49.041
But we're coloring outside the lines.

30:49.125 --> 30:51.375
-We get just as fucked for violating that…
-All right, I'm not risking it.

30:51.458 --> 30:54.583
Dude, the longer we fucking stick around
here, the dicier this shit's going to get.

30:54.666 --> 30:56.333
Look, I know. I'm fucking aware, man.

30:56.416 --> 30:57.458
Okay, let me tell you something.

30:57.541 --> 31:00.166
Jackie told me that she was hip
to a big fucking Rip that was out there,

31:00.250 --> 31:01.958
and I think that's what this is.

31:02.666 --> 31:04.250
Look, I don't know. I don't know.

31:04.333 --> 31:06.666
All I know is that fucking
what we do right now

31:06.750 --> 31:08.708
and who we fucking talk to matters.

31:08.791 --> 31:10.083
We gotta tighten our shit up.

31:10.166 --> 31:12.375
-We gotta fucking close ranks.
-Boss…

31:12.458 --> 31:15.625
I already missed visiting my girls.
Can I FaceTime them good night real fast?

31:15.708 --> 31:18.291
Lolo, please understand
where we're at right now.

31:18.375 --> 31:21.083
I understand, but this is the kind of shit
my ex crucifies me over, boss.

31:21.166 --> 31:23.958
-Please, just a quick call.
-I cannot give you a phone. I am sorry.

31:24.041 --> 31:26.541
It's a quick phone call. It's my girls.
I need to say goodnight to them.

31:26.625 --> 31:29.625
It cannot be helped.
I'm sorry. I am. I am sorry.

31:29.708 --> 31:31.875
But you gotta let me
get my head around this, please.

31:31.958 --> 31:34.250
-Fuck me. Goddamn it.
-Let me call my brother, Dane.

31:34.333 --> 31:37.625
No. Your fucking brother, the Fed,
who you were in a fistfight with today?

31:37.708 --> 31:40.375
-Let's call Matty Nix at the DEA.
-No Feds, man. No, no. Goddamn it.

31:40.458 --> 31:42.083
This is my scene. Let me run it, please.

31:42.166 --> 31:44.208
All right, chain of command,
you're in charge. I get it.

31:44.291 --> 31:46.791
-No, don't fucking do that, man.
-I'm not trying to step on your toes, man.

31:46.875 --> 31:47.916
I'm trying to help you,

31:48.000 --> 31:49.916
and you're treating me
like an asshole. Okay, lieutenant?

31:50.000 --> 31:52.791
Run your fucking crime scene, but
I don't know what the fuck you're doing.

31:52.875 --> 31:54.875
You're both making a big mistake.

31:56.250 --> 31:58.833
You should just take
whatever money you want and walk away.

31:59.750 --> 32:02.083
Before this goes really bad for all of us.

32:04.458 --> 32:05.333
Hey!

32:06.333 --> 32:07.250
Hey!

32:09.416 --> 32:12.041
Hey, there's a black-and-white
coming up the street.

32:13.666 --> 32:15.708
Stay off the radios. No call-outs.

32:15.791 --> 32:18.583
Lolo, get the rest of those containers
with them. Get them to the garage.

32:39.833 --> 32:41.125
What's going on, fellas?

32:41.208 --> 32:43.208
This many Challengers
at the end of a block.

32:43.291 --> 32:45.166
It's either bangers or UCs.

32:46.083 --> 32:48.291
Yeah, we're on the job. TNT.

32:52.166 --> 32:53.458
Could you cut your light bar?

33:10.708 --> 33:12.250
We didn't get a heads up about this.

33:13.375 --> 33:14.875
No, you didn't.

33:16.041 --> 33:19.958
-Any reason why?
-Yeah. Only reason. You're Hialeah PD.

33:22.125 --> 33:24.541
-And what's that mean, Sergeant?
-Patrolman.

33:25.125 --> 33:27.458
Do you see the gold shield around my neck?

33:27.541 --> 33:30.541
Means we can't fucking afford
what you charge to keep a secret.

33:33.166 --> 33:34.791
I know you both outrank me…

33:35.291 --> 33:36.666
but fuck that.

33:36.750 --> 33:38.166
And fuck you both.

33:38.250 --> 33:41.000
-We'll call my chief and complain…
-Hold on. I know you.

33:41.958 --> 33:43.500
Shotgun, how do I know you?

33:45.833 --> 33:48.250
-You don't know me.
-Uh, yeah, I do.

33:49.791 --> 33:51.500
You never seen me.

33:53.916 --> 33:55.375
You have a blessed night.

33:57.000 --> 33:57.916
Officers.

34:01.833 --> 34:05.125
Dipshit riding shotgun.
I recognize him. He was a VCAT cop.

34:05.208 --> 34:06.041
What?

34:06.125 --> 34:09.750
Yeah. I saw him all over Seven Seas.
I recognize that motherfucker for sure.

34:09.833 --> 34:11.916
No, they fucking…
Half those guys got suspended.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.875
-The rest of them got fucking fired.
-Yeah, or reassigned.

34:14.958 --> 34:17.333
If a Catholic priest can do
all this shit and get reassigned,

34:17.416 --> 34:19.500
-you don't think cops can…
-Not with the VCAT thing, man.

34:19.583 --> 34:21.750
That was a fucking disaster.
Who kept their job after that?

34:21.833 --> 34:23.875
Police unions. Trust me.

34:24.458 --> 34:26.291
You think they're onto this place?

34:26.375 --> 34:29.208
If these assholes knew what was in there,
we'd be fucking smoked already.

34:29.291 --> 34:30.125
Yeah.

34:36.750 --> 34:37.958
I think we're gonna get hit.

34:39.208 --> 34:40.125
Yeah.

34:41.875 --> 34:44.291
All right, let's get the rifles, vest up,
get a vest on the dog.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.541
Live to see another sunrise, bro.

34:46.625 --> 34:48.791
That's sage fucking advice tonight.

35:15.291 --> 35:17.833
I don't understand why
they took our phones.

35:17.916 --> 35:19.708
Do they not trust us?

35:22.416 --> 35:24.416
You just worried about
this little side piece

35:24.500 --> 35:25.750
you think we don't know about.

35:25.833 --> 35:27.125
Your little fuck toy.

35:27.208 --> 35:31.000
Probably texting your phone right now
like, "Mami chula, I miss you."

35:31.083 --> 35:32.416
Are you guys just gonna leave me here?

35:32.500 --> 35:34.916
-That's not true!
-Tell me what the fuck is going on!

35:35.000 --> 35:38.375
-Mami… fucking, where you at?
-Fuck this!

35:38.458 --> 35:41.416
No, I just wanted to see
my kids, man. I wanted to talk to 'em.

35:41.500 --> 35:44.208
I feel you, baby. Listen,
we're gonna get your phone back, okay?

35:45.458 --> 35:46.291
What is this?

35:46.375 --> 35:48.333
I mean, Granny got the Yellow Pages.

35:48.416 --> 35:53.833
At this point, if y'all wanna call 1987,
I'm your girl, I got you.

35:53.916 --> 35:56.291
Granny wasn't playing.
I mean, she got everything in here.

35:56.375 --> 35:58.541
She got everything
you need in here, every year.

35:58.625 --> 36:00.541
Every decade, every century.

36:00.625 --> 36:02.500
Oh, shit.

36:02.583 --> 36:05.458
Mi tio had an old station wagon
just like this.

36:05.541 --> 36:07.541
Fuck. I wonder if it still runs.

36:07.625 --> 36:09.416
I doubt it. Everything in here old.

36:09.500 --> 36:11.333
Hey, look, this is all fun…

36:13.833 --> 36:15.333
But what the fuck are we doing?

36:15.916 --> 36:17.791
-We count the seizures on site.
-Yeah.

36:17.875 --> 36:19.958
Yeah, I know
we count the seizure on sight, Numa.

36:20.041 --> 36:21.916
I'm talking about not contacting command.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.291
Radioing in. Feels kind of funky.

36:24.375 --> 36:25.833
Okay, well, it's L.T.'s call, baby.

36:25.916 --> 36:28.208
What you tripping for?
We literally do this all the time.

36:28.291 --> 36:30.416
I'm not trying to get jammed up.

36:30.500 --> 36:32.458
This is not
how Jackie would handle this shit.

36:32.541 --> 36:35.208
This is not jumping a dope hole.
This is a huge hit.

36:35.291 --> 36:38.125
Act like you've been here before.
And then act like you're coming back.

36:38.208 --> 36:41.750
Yeah, all right. Is that advice for me?
How sweet. Miss me with that bullshit.

36:41.833 --> 36:42.791
-Whoa, whoa.
-All right?

36:42.875 --> 36:45.000
-We're on our back foot right now.
-Wait, when did anyone

36:45.083 --> 36:47.375
say otherwise?

36:47.458 --> 36:49.125
It's how you handle the twist.

36:49.208 --> 36:51.708
You need to chill, now. Calmate. Do you…

36:53.750 --> 36:55.208
-Yeah.
-He need a nap.

36:55.916 --> 36:57.208
And what are you doing?

36:57.291 --> 36:59.291
Look, that's a shitty fiberglass door.

36:59.375 --> 37:01.708
Let's move this car over there
for more cover, yeah?

37:01.791 --> 37:03.708
Okay, great. Do you want me to help?

37:04.291 --> 37:06.208
Yeah, just be on deck for the back door.

37:06.291 --> 37:07.666
Okay, great.

37:09.083 --> 37:11.833
All right, let's get our vests on,
tighten up.

37:12.416 --> 37:15.125
Get your rifles, extra mags.
Let's get our shit together.

37:15.208 --> 37:16.708
Those Hialeah cops must have
scared the shit outta you.

37:16.791 --> 37:18.250
Safety first. What are you doing?

37:18.333 --> 37:21.208
Trying to get this car to the garage door
so we can get cover.

37:22.708 --> 37:23.791
Yeah, smart.

37:24.916 --> 37:25.958
Where's the girl?

37:27.000 --> 37:28.708
She's, um, handcuffed in the kitchen.

37:28.791 --> 37:30.291
-Fuck you guys!
-Hey, Lolo…

37:31.166 --> 37:33.708
Look, I know you're salty about
the phones, about the girls. I get it.

37:33.791 --> 37:35.125
-It's all right.
-But look.

37:35.208 --> 37:38.333
Please understand, it's not panic.
It's just precaution.

37:38.416 --> 37:40.208
It's okay, boss. I got you.

37:40.291 --> 37:41.541
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

37:41.625 --> 37:43.166
Is this all the containers?

37:43.250 --> 37:44.250
Yeah, that's all of them.

37:44.333 --> 37:45.208
Okay.

37:45.708 --> 37:48.458
All right, Mike. Why don't you head out
front and just keep a fucking eye out?

37:48.541 --> 37:50.875
-If you see anything unusual, holler.
-We can move the car, Mike.

37:51.708 --> 37:52.916
I don't know shit about any container.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.875
So let's figure out a system
to count this.

37:55.666 --> 37:56.833
What the fuck?

37:59.333 --> 38:00.375
TEC-9.

38:01.541 --> 38:03.708
There's a weapons charge for Desi.

38:03.791 --> 38:04.791
Fuck this!

38:04.875 --> 38:05.916
All right.

38:08.083 --> 38:10.666
All right, here's what we're gonna do.

38:10.750 --> 38:13.458
If it's labeled, 250, we leave it.

38:13.541 --> 38:15.083
Just take their word for it. All right?

38:15.166 --> 38:17.083
Don't touch it. Don't open it.
Don't fuck with it.

38:17.166 --> 38:19.458
If it's janky and fucked up like this
and there's no label…

38:19.541 --> 38:21.166
-Just count it.
-We gotta count it, all right?

38:21.250 --> 38:22.500
Or else we'll be here for two days.

38:22.583 --> 38:25.458
So anything unlabeled, we just count it.

38:25.541 --> 38:28.083
Fuck me, it'll be so much easier
if we just stole this money.

38:28.166 --> 38:30.083
I swear to God.

38:31.166 --> 38:35.791
All right. We'll make two piles like that.
Dig through them. Now, that's not marked.

38:36.291 --> 38:37.125
Marked.

38:58.458 --> 39:00.583
I get a call to leave the house
for a few hours, and I do.

39:01.833 --> 39:04.083
And they don't ID themselves?
The caller, you don't know who it is?

39:04.166 --> 39:06.083
No, they don't, and I don't ask.

39:08.333 --> 39:11.000
So, strangers, people you don't know…

39:12.041 --> 39:14.333
-come in here into the house…
-I don't ask.

39:16.208 --> 39:19.333
-And you've never seen the people?
-No, never.

39:24.416 --> 39:27.500
You said take what we wanted
and walk away. Why?

39:27.583 --> 39:29.208
That's what they told me to say.

39:29.291 --> 39:31.625
They told you?
In case of this, in case of cops?

39:32.541 --> 39:35.083
I don't think they meant
take all of it, but…

39:36.041 --> 39:39.666
they know they're gonna take their losses,
so however much money you guys took

39:39.750 --> 39:42.041
probably wouldn't amount to much,
not for them.

39:54.375 --> 39:55.541
Who is that?

39:59.833 --> 40:01.083
It's my son.

40:02.666 --> 40:04.750
Desiree Lopez Molina.

40:07.708 --> 40:08.916
You got a snitch jacket.

40:11.250 --> 40:14.000
They redlined the report,
so it's hidden. Why?

40:14.833 --> 40:16.125
Ex-boyfriend.

40:16.833 --> 40:19.000
He sold drugs, and he stole money.

40:19.708 --> 40:22.625
He's a bad guy, so I worked with the cops.

40:23.125 --> 40:24.958
I didn't like it, or him.

40:25.625 --> 40:26.916
Yeah, I can see that.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.791
Was this dude addicted to jail
or just getting caught?

40:30.416 --> 40:31.500
Can't tell.

40:32.250 --> 40:35.375
Hey, look at this.
Redlined, check out the handler.

40:41.625 --> 40:44.625
You a snitch, kid? Miami-Dade?

40:45.208 --> 40:48.833
What happened? Somebody come by the house,
leave a business card?

40:48.916 --> 40:50.000
Tell you to call back?

40:51.708 --> 40:52.875
Is that what the tablet says?

40:52.958 --> 40:55.208
Don't fuck around. It's one of two things.

40:55.291 --> 40:58.125
Either you know how hot this fucking place
was and you wanted help,

40:58.208 --> 41:00.333
or you'll dime out this stash
and make a little money.

41:00.416 --> 41:05.000
Desi, a CI on a seizure in
the state of Florida can claim up to 20%.

41:05.083 --> 41:05.916
Is that…

41:07.041 --> 41:10.333
Is that what's happening? Cause a girl
can get rich snitching in South Florida.

41:11.083 --> 41:12.000
Easy money.

41:13.291 --> 41:15.500
Hey, I get it. What are you gonna do?

41:15.583 --> 41:18.250
Grandmother dies, a couple of guys
show up from the cartels,

41:18.333 --> 41:21.083
say, hope you don't mind if
we keep 20 million in your fucking attic.

41:21.166 --> 41:24.666
What are you gonna do?
You against the whole fucking cartel?

41:35.083 --> 41:36.291
Don't pick it up.

41:42.208 --> 41:43.041
Hello?

41:43.125 --> 41:45.833
You have 30 minutes
to get the fuck out of that house.

41:45.916 --> 41:48.666
Just do your job and take the money
that was supposed to be there.

41:48.750 --> 41:51.166
No one needs to die over 150K.

41:57.416 --> 41:58.875
What was it? What did they say?

42:00.375 --> 42:02.875
Apparently we have 30 minutes
to get out of the house.

42:05.500 --> 42:07.208
Can I talk to you privately for a second?

42:09.875 --> 42:13.666
No, please listen to them. They're gonna
come in here and kill everybody.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.791
300 grand, right?

42:23.208 --> 42:24.041
What?

42:25.041 --> 42:27.916
When I asked you upstairs
how much was the Crimestopper tip for,

42:28.000 --> 42:30.458
you said about 300,000.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.416
-That's right.
-No. Wrong.

42:32.500 --> 42:34.166
Because whoever just called
on the phone said,

42:34.250 --> 42:36.833
"No one needs to die in there for 150K."

42:39.333 --> 42:40.750
The guy on the phone said 150K?

42:40.833 --> 42:43.125
Yeah. So why are you telling me
it's twice that, man?

42:43.708 --> 42:44.541
First off…

42:45.125 --> 42:46.291
-back the fuck up.
-No, man.

42:46.375 --> 42:48.208
Don't tell me to back the fuck up.

42:48.291 --> 42:50.916
Fuck you.
Tell me what's fucking going on, Dane.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.291
Once more, for clarity, J.D.,

42:53.375 --> 42:56.458
this is my crime scene.
I will run it the way I see fit.

42:56.541 --> 42:58.833
You are not running shit
if what you plan to do

42:58.916 --> 43:01.166
is torch what's left of my fucking career.

43:01.250 --> 43:05.041
I will pop smoke on this thing and
go the fuck home. Do you understand that?

43:05.583 --> 43:07.541
What, you think I want to jack this Rip?

43:10.916 --> 43:12.416
Do you think I want to jack this Rip?

43:14.083 --> 43:16.083
Dude, I don't know what you're doing, man.

43:16.750 --> 43:20.291
Uh, y-you have not been yourself
since we've been here, okay?

43:20.375 --> 43:22.333
I told you what Jackie told me.

43:22.416 --> 43:24.791
And you are lying to me,
and you are holding shit back.

43:24.875 --> 43:28.083
And don't tell me I'm imagining shit
'cause I've known you too long.

43:28.166 --> 43:29.500
What is going on?

43:32.416 --> 43:34.041
I want to see the Crimestopper tip.

43:34.125 --> 43:35.833
I want to see the piece of paper.
I want to see the tip.

43:35.916 --> 43:36.791
Just the tip?

43:36.875 --> 43:40.541
Motherfucker, I am so far
from seeing the fucking humor in this!

43:40.625 --> 43:44.375
Do you understand me? I don't trust you
right now, and that's a fucking problem!

43:44.458 --> 43:47.458
Take out the Crimestopper report.
Show me the fucking tip.

43:47.541 --> 43:50.833
-Why?
-Why not? What do you have to hide?

43:50.916 --> 43:53.000
It's a Crimestopper tip.
It's not a state secret.

43:53.875 --> 43:54.708
I-I don't have it.

43:54.791 --> 43:56.125
Dude, why are you doing this?

43:56.208 --> 43:57.541
-Hey, I don't have it.
-Where is it?

43:57.625 --> 43:59.625
-I don't have it.
-In your car? At home? Where is it?

43:59.708 --> 44:01.541
On your fucking thing? Where is it, man?

44:02.875 --> 44:04.625
I would have never fucked you like this.

44:08.083 --> 44:10.666
Motherfucker. Call the Major, or I will.

44:58.208 --> 45:00.791
Do you think the cartel
would throw me a little loan, Numa?

45:00.875 --> 45:02.666
You know, cover my nut?

45:02.750 --> 45:05.500
Mmm. It don't hurt to ask, you know?

45:05.583 --> 45:08.291
I heard they're pretty cool
about loaning money to cops.

45:12.541 --> 45:15.083
I take home 80K a year after taxes.

45:16.125 --> 45:17.583
And for that, I get…

45:18.625 --> 45:21.708
shot at, spit on,
punched, kicked, insulted,

45:21.791 --> 45:23.625
made to feel like a fucking piece of shit

45:23.708 --> 45:27.458
for being a fucking sandbag
between chaos and civilized society.

45:28.666 --> 45:32.166
Honestly, I feel like you put a little bit
of thought into them thoughts, Lolo.

45:37.500 --> 45:39.125
What would you do with this, Numa?

45:46.916 --> 45:48.083
Everything.

45:54.666 --> 45:55.750
Just this.

45:59.125 --> 46:00.666
This little money right here…

46:04.083 --> 46:06.458
would make my life so much easier to live.

46:19.208 --> 46:21.708
Hey, Dayo. Wrap these pricks up.
Let's get out of here.

46:21.791 --> 46:23.041
I just started fucking with them.

46:23.125 --> 46:26.666
No, fuck them. You know, fuck you
especially. I don't like you, asshole.

46:29.583 --> 46:30.666
Good night. You have a good one.

46:30.750 --> 46:33.083
-We'll see you later.
-Yeah, fuck you.

46:33.166 --> 46:35.333
Hey, Byrne-sy, where you at?

46:35.416 --> 46:38.333
Hey, man, we walked into a real one
tonight. I may need your help.

46:40.666 --> 46:41.500
What's up?

46:42.083 --> 46:44.500
We had a Crimestopper tip
come in after closing.

46:44.583 --> 46:47.958
We ran it. Now I'm out here in Hialeah,
stuck in the shit.

46:48.750 --> 46:50.000
Stuck in the shit how?

46:50.500 --> 46:51.333
A Rip.

46:51.916 --> 46:53.916
More money
than you can fucking count.

46:54.000 --> 46:54.875
Fuck.

46:55.500 --> 46:57.666
Yeah, and I'm worried about Dane, dude.

46:57.750 --> 47:01.041
I don't know where his head is at.
He's not doing shit right.

47:02.791 --> 47:04.208
What the hell does that mean?

47:05.333 --> 47:07.083
Well, he hasn't called it in yet.

47:07.166 --> 47:08.875
The Rip? To Command?

47:09.458 --> 47:10.291
Yeah.

47:11.583 --> 47:12.916
Well, that's no fucking good.

47:13.708 --> 47:17.000
Is there anything
that you've heard about him?

47:17.083 --> 47:20.541
No, only that he's got a full head
of steam for solving Jackie's murder.

47:20.625 --> 47:22.958
Yeah… We all do. They were close.

47:24.500 --> 47:25.833
How close, J.D.?

47:26.583 --> 47:28.083
What are we talking about?

47:28.166 --> 47:30.041
J.D., you were in love.

47:30.125 --> 47:33.708
You and Jackie had a thing, it was
the world's worst fucking kept secret.

47:34.833 --> 47:35.958
Yeah, we did.

47:36.833 --> 47:38.541
Yeah, and you lost your promotion.

47:39.666 --> 47:40.916
To Dane.

47:42.500 --> 47:43.750
That wasn't personal.

47:44.333 --> 47:45.166
Says who?

47:45.250 --> 47:46.666
That just wasn't how Jackie did shit.

47:46.750 --> 47:48.583
-Says who?
-Says me.

47:48.666 --> 47:50.958
Look, what if Jackie
was working that stash house,

47:51.041 --> 47:52.875
the one you're on tonight, huh?

47:52.958 --> 47:55.291
And what if Dane found out about that?

47:56.666 --> 47:58.583
Does that track? Is that possible?

48:01.416 --> 48:03.708
I don't--
I mean, it's possible. It tracks.

48:04.625 --> 48:06.166
So ask yourself this.

48:07.083 --> 48:08.291
Slowly.

48:08.375 --> 48:10.500
Live to see another sunrise.

48:10.583 --> 48:14.708
Is the size of that Rip
worth the price of a Miami police captain?

48:15.333 --> 48:18.375
No, Jesus Christ,
Dane didn't fucking kill Jackie.

48:18.458 --> 48:20.250
I'm just saying that the guy is broke.

48:20.333 --> 48:23.250
He's in medical debt, his son is gone,
his marriage has imploded,

48:23.333 --> 48:26.958
and we both know he's been on the mend
mentally for more than a minute.

48:27.041 --> 48:30.250
Yeah, watch your ten-year-old son
die of cancer, wouldn't you be?

48:30.333 --> 48:33.416
That's right, and only he knows
how that will fuck up your frame of mind.

48:34.500 --> 48:36.958
But we all know
that he's never gonna truly recover,

48:37.041 --> 48:40.041
which means that he's a man
that we can never truly trust.

48:40.875 --> 48:44.000
J.D., what do you have to lose
after you've lost everything?

48:46.083 --> 48:48.541
Fuck! All right,
I gotta talk to my brother.

48:48.625 --> 48:52.666
Fuck that. Fuck the feds, don't do that.
Listen, I'm wrapping up right now.

48:53.916 --> 48:57.458
Let me get to you. Ten minutes,
I will text you. Watch your back.

48:57.541 --> 48:58.375
All right.

48:58.958 --> 48:59.791
Fuck.

49:00.500 --> 49:02.166
Dayo, come here.

49:08.666 --> 49:10.583
Who's gonna give a fuck?

49:10.666 --> 49:13.916
Who's gonna miss
10, 20, 30 thousand dollars?

49:15.000 --> 49:17.125
For real. Count this money,
make sure that shit is all here.

49:17.208 --> 49:19.333
I'm not trying to fucking
be here all night.

49:19.416 --> 49:22.666
Hey, guys, listen up.
I gotta run something by you, and…

49:23.916 --> 49:25.958
Listen. If you're not down with it,
I understand.

49:26.041 --> 49:27.583
But just between us…

49:29.000 --> 49:31.375
I think we can make
something happen here. All right?

49:31.458 --> 49:34.125
I know we're all thinking it,
so let's get realistic right now.

49:34.208 --> 49:37.916
But I wanna get mine,
and I know you wanna get yours. All right?

49:38.750 --> 49:39.916
I wanna get paid.

50:11.166 --> 50:12.625
What's going on, Mike?

50:12.708 --> 50:14.875
God… what the fuck.

50:14.958 --> 50:18.666
Sarge, you can't creep up
on someone like that. Damn.

50:20.583 --> 50:22.583
These lights is what's up.

50:22.666 --> 50:23.625
What lights?

50:24.208 --> 50:25.208
Those lights.

50:25.833 --> 50:27.791
They all came on at once. It was like a…

50:27.875 --> 50:29.750
on, like, a timer or something.

50:29.833 --> 50:31.875
-On both sides of the street?
-Yeah.

50:33.000 --> 50:33.875
Where are the people?

50:36.833 --> 50:38.125
I haven't seen a soul.

50:38.916 --> 50:39.833
Where are the cars?

50:43.041 --> 50:45.916
You hear this bullshit about
the cartels buying up the housing blocks?

50:46.000 --> 50:48.041
Let's not get into ghost stories, okay?

50:48.125 --> 50:50.041
We got enough fucking problems right now.

50:52.708 --> 50:53.541
Sarge.

50:54.916 --> 50:55.750
We good in there?

50:58.000 --> 50:59.750
Yeah. Relax. Everything's fine.

51:00.875 --> 51:02.500
-It's all right.
-All right.

51:04.666 --> 51:07.041
-Oh, shit. You see that?
-What?

51:07.125 --> 51:08.958
Watch, watch. Right there, right there.

51:09.041 --> 51:11.125
At first I thought it was,
like, electrical short,

51:11.208 --> 51:12.916
but I think it's falling into a pattern.

51:14.250 --> 51:15.500
Am I seeing shit?

51:17.250 --> 51:18.083
No.

51:18.875 --> 51:20.041
It is a pattern.

51:21.500 --> 51:22.708
It's Morse code.

51:24.166 --> 51:25.541
P-I…

51:26.375 --> 51:27.291
G…

51:28.458 --> 51:29.333
S.

51:30.583 --> 51:31.750
They know we're here.

51:32.250 --> 51:35.541
Yeah. Go let the lieutenant know.
I'm gonna check out that house.

51:36.541 --> 51:37.875
You gonna go solo?

51:37.958 --> 51:38.875
Yeah.

52:05.416 --> 52:07.583
Hey, Lotta, it's L.T. I need the Major.

52:10.500 --> 52:11.958
Major, hey, uh…

52:12.458 --> 52:15.708
So we had a tip come in late.
House up in Hialeah.

52:15.791 --> 52:17.875
Looks like the Rip's about 150K.

52:22.875 --> 52:26.458
Nah, don't send SWAT.
We're not gonna need… We're QRU.

52:29.208 --> 52:31.791
Yeah, we'll just…
we'll walk it out ourselves.

52:31.875 --> 52:35.875
Just let me finish the count,
and I'll check back in. Yeah.

52:41.541 --> 52:44.375
What the fuck am I gonna do?
What the fuck am I gonna do?

52:44.458 --> 52:45.875
What the fuck am I gonna do?

52:47.416 --> 52:48.625
What the fuck…?

52:54.583 --> 52:56.125
Ro, they're gonna steal the money.

52:58.041 --> 53:00.083
What? Who?

53:00.166 --> 53:01.208
Yeah.

53:01.291 --> 53:02.833
Your L.T., whatever,
and the other two, okay?

53:02.916 --> 53:04.250
I heard them talking in the garage.

53:04.333 --> 53:05.750
Wait, you heard them say this?

53:05.833 --> 53:07.458
Yes. All right?

53:07.958 --> 53:11.541
He called someone, a Major,
a higher command,

53:11.625 --> 53:14.708
and he told them that there was
only $150,000 in this fucking house.

53:14.791 --> 53:17.291
-Just now you heard them…
-Right before you walked in, okay?

53:17.375 --> 53:19.583
You may be the only fucking person
we can trust, all right?

53:19.666 --> 53:21.666
You gotta call somebody, anybody. Don't…

53:26.541 --> 53:28.416
What are you doing inside, Detective?

53:28.500 --> 53:31.500
Uh, Sarge sent me in to tell you
about this house up the street.

53:38.208 --> 53:39.541
What house up the street?

53:39.625 --> 53:41.416
He went to go check it out. They were…

53:41.500 --> 53:44.333
It's looking like they were using
their porch lights to signal somebody.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.791
Why don't we take a walk? You show me.

54:14.000 --> 54:15.458
I want you to arrest me!

54:18.916 --> 54:19.916
Take me to jail!

54:20.000 --> 54:22.916
Please, get me the fuck out of here!

54:26.125 --> 54:27.875
They're gonna fucking kill us!

54:30.625 --> 54:33.166
Uncuff me! Please, fuck, let me go!

54:33.250 --> 54:34.750
-Hello?
-Listen to me.

54:34.833 --> 54:39.083
People are gonna start dying
in ten minutes. Get the fuck out.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.666
Now, what were you and Desi discussing?

55:08.541 --> 55:09.625
Nothing.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.833
No, not nothing. That was a discussion.

55:16.250 --> 55:18.208
She's scared. What do you expect?

55:19.083 --> 55:20.125
Scared of what?

55:21.416 --> 55:22.375
Us.

55:23.500 --> 55:25.583
I think cops
make a lot of people nervous.

55:26.708 --> 55:28.000
They make you nervous?

55:29.000 --> 55:31.333
Sure. Some.

55:33.916 --> 55:35.750
It's right there. It's that house.

55:36.250 --> 55:39.333
The light keeps going on and off.
Sarge said it's Morse code.

55:40.041 --> 55:41.333
It spells out "pigs"?

55:47.875 --> 55:49.166
You get that, L.T.?

55:50.625 --> 55:52.125
You a snitch, Mike?

55:57.333 --> 55:58.625
You trying to rattle me?

56:00.666 --> 56:01.750
I don't know.

56:06.458 --> 56:07.958
You're not serious, L.T.

56:21.750 --> 56:24.333
Why don't you head back to the house
and help 'em finish the count?

56:27.208 --> 56:28.458
I'll handle the Sarge.

56:37.583 --> 56:38.625
All right.

57:12.083 --> 57:14.708
They're gonna rip the stash.
We need to move. Now!

58:05.416 --> 58:07.291
Please get me out of here.

58:07.375 --> 58:10.541
Hey, Desi, be cool, all right?

58:10.625 --> 58:12.208
Nothing's gonna happen to you.
I won't let it.

58:12.291 --> 58:13.291
Did you call someone?

58:14.041 --> 58:16.250
I did. They're on their way. Stay calm.

58:22.291 --> 58:23.708
Hey, it's Ro.

58:24.625 --> 58:25.541
What the fuck is this?

58:33.083 --> 58:35.166
Are these zip--
Why do you have zip ties on the door?

58:35.250 --> 58:37.000
We don't want people coming in or out.

58:37.708 --> 58:39.083
People? It's just us.

58:45.958 --> 58:46.875
What are we doing here?

58:49.166 --> 58:50.166
Counting.

58:51.125 --> 58:52.500
I thought you were on the street.

58:52.583 --> 58:53.625
I was.

58:54.625 --> 58:55.833
They sent me back in to help.

58:56.416 --> 58:57.958
We good. Lo, we good?

58:58.666 --> 59:01.333
Yep. We've got a system now. Thank you.

59:03.166 --> 59:04.458
It's looking like 20 mil?

59:05.958 --> 59:07.250
Help me with this right there.

59:13.875 --> 59:14.916
How are we looking?

59:15.000 --> 59:16.208
We got a phone call.

59:17.000 --> 59:18.041
Yeah? What'd they say?

59:18.625 --> 59:20.875
That we had ten minutes
before we started dying,

59:20.958 --> 59:22.958
and that was about five minutes ago.

59:23.041 --> 59:24.250
How close are we on the count?

59:24.333 --> 59:25.958
I know what the fuck you're doing.

59:26.041 --> 59:27.583
Not further than five minutes.

59:27.666 --> 59:29.416
All right, we gotta pick it up.
We gotta go.

59:31.958 --> 59:33.791
What the fuck are you doing, man?
You gonna help?

59:36.958 --> 59:37.791
Where's Sarge?

59:40.250 --> 59:41.375
We got separated.

59:43.291 --> 59:44.541
Find anything in that house?

59:46.666 --> 59:47.500
No.

59:48.583 --> 59:51.000
-Should I get him on the radio?
-Stay off the fucking radio.

59:54.250 --> 59:56.458
All right, Maglites.
Get them low. Keep them low.

01:00:26.166 --> 01:00:28.833
Fuck! Fuck! I got clipped.

01:00:28.916 --> 01:00:29.958
Motherfucker!

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:33.416
Stay with Lolo, Numa! Stay with Lolo!

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:36.166
Mike! Mike! On me! On me!

01:00:36.250 --> 01:00:38.375
Motherfuckers! They fucking got me!

01:00:38.458 --> 01:00:40.541
I got you. I got you.

01:00:40.625 --> 01:00:41.750
Come on.

01:00:43.541 --> 01:00:44.500
Fuck.

01:00:46.708 --> 01:00:48.291
We're not getting the power back.

01:00:48.375 --> 01:00:50.333
Help me! Get me out of here!

01:00:50.416 --> 01:00:52.375
We're gonna stop the bleeding.

01:00:54.333 --> 01:00:55.916
Fuck. The cars.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.208
Blood trail. Stay on me, Mike.

01:00:58.291 --> 01:01:00.833
-Get me the fuck out of here!
-Are you hit?

01:01:00.916 --> 01:01:03.166
No! But please,
get me the fuck out of here!

01:01:03.250 --> 01:01:05.541
We got a lot of real shit happening, okay?

01:01:05.625 --> 01:01:08.791
So if you don't have a bullet lodged
in your fucking body, please shut up!

01:01:15.333 --> 01:01:16.208
Fence, fence, fence!

01:01:17.958 --> 01:01:19.125
Vamos, vamos.

01:01:25.125 --> 01:01:26.750
You're fucking crazy!

01:01:26.833 --> 01:01:28.916
Desi! Is the dog okay?

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:29.916
Where's the fucking dog?

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.333
I can hear him but I can't see him.

01:01:32.416 --> 01:01:33.750
Wilbur!

01:01:41.125 --> 01:01:41.958
Wilbur!

01:01:42.041 --> 01:01:43.708
You guys are fucking crazy!

01:01:43.791 --> 01:01:45.625
-Wilbur!
-Get me the fuck out of here!

01:01:45.708 --> 01:01:47.083
Please shut the fuck up.

01:01:48.333 --> 01:01:49.708
Cover! Cover!

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:02.291
Listen, I'm gonna uncuff you.

01:02:02.375 --> 01:02:05.333
Don't fuck me up, okay?
Find some candles. Get some light in here.

01:02:05.416 --> 01:02:07.041
I know what the fuck you're doing.

01:02:10.625 --> 01:02:12.791
-I'm breaking loose!
-Mike, move. I got the roof!

01:02:49.583 --> 01:02:50.416
Coming out!

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:53.583
How many of these fucking guys
are out here?

01:02:54.250 --> 01:02:56.250
I don't fucking know.

01:02:56.333 --> 01:02:59.833
I'm pretty sure we got one of them.
There were three in the truck.

01:03:00.958 --> 01:03:01.958
Goddamn.

01:03:03.083 --> 01:03:04.750
Hey, down! Down! Get the fuck down!

01:03:04.833 --> 01:03:06.083
Down! Get down!

01:03:06.166 --> 01:03:07.375
Down! Down! Get the fuck down!

01:03:07.458 --> 01:03:09.000
Get down! Down! Get the fuck down!

01:03:09.083 --> 01:03:12.666
Hold up! Hold up! Hold up!
Hey! Hey! He's cool.

01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:13.833
What the fuck do you mean, he's cool?

01:03:13.916 --> 01:03:16.000
It's not him. He's the guy in the porch.
He's on look-out.

01:03:16.083 --> 01:03:17.125
What does he mean, it's not us?

01:03:17.208 --> 01:03:19.250
It's the guy from the porch light.
He's cartel.

01:03:19.333 --> 01:03:21.666
-They weren't the ones who fucking hit us.
-Who the fuck did?

01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:23.000
I don't know.

01:03:23.083 --> 01:03:23.958
Okay, claro.

01:03:24.541 --> 01:03:26.291
Yo, what are you doing? What's he doing?

01:03:26.375 --> 01:03:28.291
He's calling his boss. Calm down.

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:41.416
You need to remember that I'm up here

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:43.541
and you're down there.

01:03:43.625 --> 01:03:44.791
Shut the fuck up.

01:03:46.583 --> 01:03:47.541
Damn it.

01:04:03.375 --> 01:04:06.333
Let me tell you,
since it is likely being recorded,

01:04:06.416 --> 01:04:08.291
none of our members

01:04:08.375 --> 01:04:11.708
had anything to do with
whoever attacked you violently tonight.

01:04:12.583 --> 01:04:14.583
We also have no interest in the money

01:04:14.666 --> 01:04:16.875
that may have been discovered
in that house.

01:04:16.958 --> 01:04:19.791
Are you aware of the amount of money?

01:04:21.375 --> 01:04:22.791
That's of no importance.

01:04:22.875 --> 01:04:25.333
This is the chess game we play.

01:04:25.416 --> 01:04:27.583
And tonight you are the winner.

01:04:27.666 --> 01:04:30.125
And we don't want more
dead police officers.

01:04:30.208 --> 01:04:34.541
The captain who was killed
has already hurt our business enough.

01:04:34.625 --> 01:04:38.625
Did the cartel have anything
to do with the murder of Captain Velez?

01:04:44.333 --> 01:04:46.000
Good luck, Detectives.

01:04:46.083 --> 01:04:48.083
You will need a lot of it tonight.

01:04:54.166 --> 01:04:55.125
What's going on?

01:04:55.791 --> 01:04:57.083
-Let's go.
-He said…

01:04:58.416 --> 01:05:00.291
they're abandoning the stash house.

01:05:00.375 --> 01:05:02.333
He said it wasn't them that attacked us.

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:05.125
That's not all he fucking said.

01:05:05.208 --> 01:05:07.291
They're fucking walking away
from $20 million?

01:05:07.375 --> 01:05:09.208
Killing a cop is expensive.

01:05:09.291 --> 01:05:11.791
Killing five of us bankrupts
even the best dope game.

01:05:11.875 --> 01:05:13.125
These guys aren't stupid.

01:05:13.208 --> 01:05:15.416
At the end of the day,
20 million is a write-off.

01:05:24.333 --> 01:05:25.541
Lolo, you good?

01:05:25.625 --> 01:05:27.791
Yeah, boss, I'm good. I'm fine.

01:05:27.875 --> 01:05:29.666
Guys, the cartel didn't hit us.

01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:33.208
It wasn't them, and they're doing
a quitclaim. They're walking away.

01:05:41.625 --> 01:05:43.875
So if they don't want the money,
it's anybody's ball, yeah?

01:05:47.791 --> 01:05:48.833
What does that mean?

01:05:50.666 --> 01:05:52.750
Vouch what was in the Crimestopper.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.458
What about the rest?

01:05:56.166 --> 01:06:00.291
I mean, you want to be a thief, Lolo?
Commit. Come on, say it.

01:06:02.208 --> 01:06:04.000
Are you gonna pay
child support for my girls?

01:06:04.083 --> 01:06:05.708
Is this the example
you want to set for them?

01:06:06.291 --> 01:06:09.625
What does it matter…
I took a bullet for this money.

01:06:10.791 --> 01:06:12.291
You already called the Major, yeah, boss?

01:06:14.166 --> 01:06:15.000
Yeah.

01:06:15.666 --> 01:06:16.500
Yeah, when?

01:06:21.416 --> 01:06:22.250
Earlier.

01:06:25.375 --> 01:06:26.833
Yeah, I told him about the Rip,

01:06:26.916 --> 01:06:29.000
told him we were going to finish
the count, walk it out ourselves.

01:06:29.083 --> 01:06:31.500
With what? Our cars are fucking trashed.

01:06:31.583 --> 01:06:33.125
Call an SRT, get a retrieval team.

01:06:35.125 --> 01:06:36.791
-Are you assuming command now, J.D.?
-Where's the printout?

01:06:36.875 --> 01:06:38.208
Fuck the printout.

01:06:41.541 --> 01:06:45.625
There was no fucking Crimestopper report.
Just so you know, he made it up.

01:06:45.708 --> 01:06:47.500
To get us out here
to steal this fucking Rip.

01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:53.875
You were Jackie's second-in-command.
She knew about it. You knew about it, too.

01:06:53.958 --> 01:06:56.041
-Easy, motherfucker.
-Who's out there, Dane?

01:06:56.125 --> 01:06:57.666
Who just hit us right now?

01:06:57.750 --> 01:07:00.291
You part of some
fucking asshole, corrupt cop team

01:07:00.375 --> 01:07:03.291
-knocking over stash houses like this?
-Hey. What about you, man?

01:07:03.375 --> 01:07:04.625
-What about me?
-Huh?

01:07:04.708 --> 01:07:07.750
The fucking ex-VCAT detective
that you recognized.

01:07:07.833 --> 01:07:11.125
Shit started to get real weird after that
guy showed up. It's been weird ever since.

01:07:11.208 --> 01:07:13.125
You think I'm lying in the cut
with that fucking cunt?

01:07:13.208 --> 01:07:16.458
And then you disappear
for, what, 30-odd minutes

01:07:16.541 --> 01:07:19.625
and come back
with an armed cartel lookout?

01:07:21.416 --> 01:07:23.083
Did you shoot up the garage, man?

01:07:23.166 --> 01:07:24.000
Pick a lane, Dane.

01:07:24.083 --> 01:07:26.791
Either I'm mobbed up with the fucking cops
or I'm running with the cartel.

01:07:26.875 --> 01:07:28.625
And your own fucking brother,
a federal agent…

01:07:28.708 --> 01:07:29.708
Uh-huh?

01:07:29.791 --> 01:07:31.666
…keeps circling back, questioning you.
You, man.

01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:33.666
-Why?
-That is the weakest shit I've ever heard,

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:36.541
so let me put
my fucking foot through it right now.

01:07:36.625 --> 01:07:40.541
So when we're all getting deposed,
you remember this fucking moment.

01:07:43.291 --> 01:07:46.708
What did Mr. Cartel say on the phone
about Jackie?

01:07:52.791 --> 01:07:55.166
"Our people think she was killed

01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:56.833
by a member of her own team."

01:08:04.583 --> 01:08:07.583
-You kill Jackie, Dane?
-Oh, fuck you, man. Fuck off.

01:08:07.666 --> 01:08:10.833
You want to steal this Rip, Dane.
Just say it out loud.

01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:15.458
L.T., come on.

01:08:18.625 --> 01:08:21.000
I just figured it out
why you don't like being a cop.

01:08:21.083 --> 01:08:22.458
'Cause you're not a fucking cop.

01:08:23.958 --> 01:08:26.250
You're a fucking
piece of shit cop-killer…

01:08:27.916 --> 01:08:28.833
No, stop it!

01:08:31.125 --> 01:08:34.000
Stop it, guys. What are you…
What the fuck are you doing?

01:08:40.666 --> 01:08:42.125
Oh, my God. Stop!

01:08:44.708 --> 01:08:46.791
Stop it! Stop! Get off!

01:08:49.166 --> 01:08:50.000
-Break it up!
-Stop!

01:08:50.083 --> 01:08:51.416
Get the fuck off me!

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Fuck you!

01:09:00.041 --> 01:09:01.208
-Just go!
-Fuck you.

01:09:11.208 --> 01:09:13.125
We finish the count. Now.

01:09:13.208 --> 01:09:15.166
We get the money,
we get the fuck out of here.

01:09:15.250 --> 01:09:18.041
Hey, go sit with her.
She does not move.

01:09:18.708 --> 01:09:20.125
Are we arresting her?

01:09:20.208 --> 01:09:21.875
-What the fuck did I just say?
-All right!

01:09:21.958 --> 01:09:24.541
-When did you hear the word "arrest"?
-All right!

01:09:24.625 --> 01:09:25.875
Come on.

01:09:26.375 --> 01:09:28.583
Let's just go, girl.
Let's get this shit wrapped up, okay?

01:09:28.666 --> 01:09:31.041
It's been a long fucking night.
We're good.

01:09:31.666 --> 01:09:33.541
Just watch her and let's wrap this up.

01:09:38.041 --> 01:09:40.625
-They're gonna kill us, aren't they?
-It's gonna be all right.

01:09:40.708 --> 01:09:42.791
You have to help.
You're the only good one!

01:10:15.875 --> 01:10:17.750
Yo, Matty. Dane's doing the Rip.

01:10:17.833 --> 01:10:19.791
He's gone rogue, man.
You gotta fucking get here.

01:10:19.875 --> 01:10:21.125
We're inbound now.

01:10:21.208 --> 01:10:22.875
You got the full kick, whole team?

01:10:22.958 --> 01:10:25.791
No. Had to cut my starters loose.
Can't afford the fucking overtime.

01:10:25.875 --> 01:10:26.875
Fuck.

01:10:26.958 --> 01:10:28.833
Listen, I've got an armored Lenco.
We're good.

01:10:30.208 --> 01:10:33.541
I want to get to that armored count room
you guys set up by Jackson Memorial.

01:10:33.625 --> 01:10:35.416
J.D., how much you sitting on?

01:10:35.916 --> 01:10:37.166
I'm staring at over 20 mil.

01:10:39.375 --> 01:10:40.500
You shitting me?

01:10:41.208 --> 01:10:42.041
No, I am not.

01:10:42.125 --> 01:10:44.958
So get here fast as you fucking can
before somebody gets killed.

01:10:45.791 --> 01:10:48.458
You just fucking hang on.
We're right there. We're right there.

01:11:01.791 --> 01:11:04.416
Desi. Hey. Hey.

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:07.333
Listen, I had a burner in there.
A hidden phone.

01:11:07.416 --> 01:11:09.625
I think I lost it
when I was breaking up their fight.

01:11:09.708 --> 01:11:12.083
You don't have a phone that you use
to contact the cartel, do you?

01:11:12.166 --> 01:11:14.041
No, your boss took it from me, remember?

01:11:14.708 --> 01:11:15.750
Fuck!

01:11:22.291 --> 01:11:24.166
That's it. That's all of them.

01:11:24.875 --> 01:11:27.666
80 pounds apiece. Bullet-proofed.

01:11:38.375 --> 01:11:39.666
All right, Numa.

01:11:40.958 --> 01:11:42.875
This is the number. Don't say it out loud.

01:11:43.375 --> 01:11:45.333
-Got it.
-All right, Lolo.

01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:48.958
-Tell me when you got it.
-Okay.

01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:53.208
-I got it.
-Okay.

01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:58.041
Don't answer it.

01:11:59.250 --> 01:12:01.583
How are we getting this money
out of here, boss?

01:12:02.625 --> 01:12:05.500
-All the cars fucked up? Like, done?
-All of them.

01:12:06.583 --> 01:12:09.000
-See if Desi has the keys?
-You think it runs?

01:12:09.625 --> 01:12:11.291
I mean, it's shot to shit, but…

01:12:13.958 --> 01:12:15.750
Oh, shit! We're on fire!

01:12:15.833 --> 01:12:16.750
Get the bags.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.750
All right. We'll come back for the rest.

01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:34.000
Oh, my God! What the fuck?

01:12:37.375 --> 01:12:38.375
You all right?

01:12:40.041 --> 01:12:42.833
Oh, my God, the house.
The house is fucking burning.

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:46.333
The house is fucking burning!
Is anyone calling anyone?

01:12:46.833 --> 01:12:48.375
Only here to help. What can I do?

01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:58.583
All right, let's load the money bags
into the back of the Lenco.

01:12:58.666 --> 01:13:01.708
Numa, you stay here.
I want you to stay with Desi.

01:13:01.791 --> 01:13:03.791
-Wait for Fire and Rescue.
-No, boss, I'm fine. Let's go.

01:13:03.875 --> 01:13:06.208
No, we've been breathing in
a lot of smoke in there.

01:13:06.291 --> 01:13:07.291
Boss, I said I'm fine.

01:13:07.375 --> 01:13:09.958
I'm not gonna fucking
argue with you about this.

01:13:10.041 --> 01:13:12.083
-I want you to stay here.
-No, no, no.

01:13:12.166 --> 01:13:14.208
You're not fucking going anywhere.
We're done.

01:13:14.916 --> 01:13:16.833
-Hey, no, you are staying on site.
-Shut the fuck up.

01:13:16.916 --> 01:13:19.333
Hey. Listen to me.
You stay with me and the money.

01:13:19.416 --> 01:13:21.125
-You called Nix, motherfucker?
-I don't take orders from you.

01:13:21.208 --> 01:13:23.250
-No, no. I'm fucking in charge!
-You're finished. You hear me?

01:13:23.333 --> 01:13:25.458
-Fuck you!
-What the fuck are you two doing?

01:13:25.541 --> 01:13:28.291
Just fucking load in.
What the fuck's wrong with you two?

01:13:28.916 --> 01:13:30.541
So that's it? You're gonna burn us, boss?

01:13:30.625 --> 01:13:32.416
That's it? You're just gonna
take the fucking money?

01:13:34.208 --> 01:13:36.958
And what about
my grandmother's house? It's burning.

01:14:26.041 --> 01:14:27.916
In case anything jumps…

01:14:29.458 --> 01:14:31.291
I don't want to worry
about clearing my weapon.

01:14:58.708 --> 01:15:00.208
Where are we taking this money?

01:15:01.458 --> 01:15:03.833
DEA-held Wells Fargo near the hospital.

01:15:12.166 --> 01:15:13.250
What are you doing?

01:15:14.208 --> 01:15:18.000
I'm calling the Major.
I'll let him know to meet us at the bank.

01:15:19.291 --> 01:15:20.958
Dane already let him know,
didn't you, Dane?

01:15:24.208 --> 01:15:25.291
Yeah, he's aware.

01:15:25.791 --> 01:15:27.375
No, he's not.

01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:32.791
He knows about the Rip,
but not the total amount.

01:15:34.916 --> 01:15:36.166
How would you know that?

01:15:41.458 --> 01:15:44.000
You know, you never
answered my question from earlier.

01:15:45.291 --> 01:15:46.291
Are you a snitch?

01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:50.291
L.T., why don't you go fuck yourself?
That's my answer.

01:15:50.375 --> 01:15:51.708
Hey, everybody, calm down.

01:15:51.791 --> 01:15:53.458
People are tired.
It's been a long fucking night.

01:15:55.791 --> 01:15:57.333
Now it's about to get a lot longer.

01:15:57.416 --> 01:15:59.666
Dane, Ro is not Internal Affairs.

01:15:59.750 --> 01:16:00.916
I didn't say he was IA.

01:16:02.625 --> 01:16:04.416
He's snitching for someone else.

01:16:05.625 --> 01:16:06.791
Who's moving on this money?

01:16:06.875 --> 01:16:09.291
You mean the money
you've been trying to steal all night?

01:16:10.208 --> 01:16:14.291
That girl Desi told me that you
told the Major that the Rip was only 150k.

01:16:14.375 --> 01:16:16.458
That's right.
Did it sound something like this?

01:16:16.541 --> 01:16:18.750
"Hello, Major. This is Dumars."

01:16:18.833 --> 01:16:20.791
"Yeah, we took a tip late
on a house in Hialeah."

01:16:20.875 --> 01:16:22.916
"The Rip looks like it's about 150k."

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.750
"No, don't send SRT.
We're gonna walk it out ourselves."

01:16:25.833 --> 01:16:27.625
"We're gonna finish the count,
and I'll check back in."

01:16:27.708 --> 01:16:28.833
Is that what she heard?

01:16:28.916 --> 01:16:31.541
She told me that you were planning on
boosting that money with Numa and Lolo.

01:16:31.625 --> 01:16:33.166
That's what she told me.

01:16:33.250 --> 01:16:35.750
Detective, that girl heard me saying

01:16:35.833 --> 01:16:38.250
exactly what I wanted her to hear me say.

01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:40.958
Hey, guys, listen up.

01:16:41.708 --> 01:16:44.833
I got something I gotta run by you.
All right? Now…

01:16:46.291 --> 01:16:48.208
If you're not down with it, I understand.

01:16:48.291 --> 01:16:51.791
I'll deny that I ever said it.
But just between us…

01:16:53.083 --> 01:16:54.625
I think we can
make something happen here.

01:16:54.708 --> 01:16:56.708
All right? I wanna get paid.

01:16:58.291 --> 01:17:00.666
-I wanna rob the Rip.
-Let's do it.

01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:02.500
All right. Now, listen.

01:17:02.583 --> 01:17:05.083
I knew she'd tell you
about me and Numa and Lolo.

01:17:05.166 --> 01:17:06.583
Ro, they're gonna steal the money.

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:08.791
Because she trusted you.

01:17:09.541 --> 01:17:10.583
You looked the part.

01:17:12.416 --> 01:17:16.666
I also knew she'd tell you about the Major
and the phone call and the 150K.

01:17:17.458 --> 01:17:19.875
That wasn't the first time
you heard that number, though, was it?

01:17:22.208 --> 01:17:25.833
That's the number I gave you back at HQ
when you asked me about the Rip.

01:17:26.708 --> 01:17:29.541
-Yeah. You did. And…?
-And…

01:17:30.375 --> 01:17:33.291
he told me it was 300K.

01:17:35.583 --> 01:17:37.458
I told Numa it was 250.

01:17:38.125 --> 01:17:40.041
I told Lolo it was 75.

01:17:40.916 --> 01:17:44.875
The only person
who ever heard 150K was you.

01:17:45.583 --> 01:17:46.958
And whoever called the house.

01:17:48.541 --> 01:17:49.666
What are you talking about?

01:17:50.791 --> 01:17:56.041
The voice on the phone said,
"Take the 150K and leave."

01:17:56.125 --> 01:17:57.791
No one needs to die over 150K.

01:17:57.875 --> 01:17:59.583
How much is this Rip supposed to be?

01:17:59.666 --> 01:18:00.583
150K.

01:18:00.666 --> 01:18:04.708
-150K. Exact.
-Now, where'd he get that number?

01:18:05.333 --> 01:18:07.583
So I called the fucking house? How's that?

01:18:08.083 --> 01:18:09.791
I was standing right there.
You took my phone.

01:18:09.875 --> 01:18:11.208
You've been using a burner all night.

01:18:11.291 --> 01:18:13.916
I don't have a fucking burner.
I don't have a 33 on me.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.250
What's this, Mike?

01:18:23.708 --> 01:18:26.250
-I don't know. That's not mine.
-You've never seen it before? Yeah.

01:18:26.333 --> 01:18:28.583
Well, that's strange, because
that's the burner he took off you

01:18:28.666 --> 01:18:31.208
-when we were fighting in the garage.
-Yep. That's where I got it.

01:18:31.291 --> 01:18:32.791
Get the fuck off me!

01:18:33.875 --> 01:18:35.875
But don't worry.
There's an easy way to solve it.

01:18:35.958 --> 01:18:38.625
We'll just see if your face unlocks
the fucking phone. Let's test it out.

01:18:38.708 --> 01:18:41.833
-Guys, what are we doing here?
-What are you doing?

01:18:41.916 --> 01:18:43.791
-You called in those Hialeah cops.
-What?

01:18:43.875 --> 01:18:46.666
-You set fire to the stash house.
-Are you hearing this bullshit?

01:18:46.750 --> 01:18:49.333
You've been trying
to steal this Rip all night.

01:18:50.583 --> 01:18:51.916
See, the thing about lying, Detective,

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.125
it becomes real hard to keep
those timelines straight.

01:18:54.208 --> 01:18:57.541
Who did what? Who did it when?
The truth is much more of a straight line.

01:18:57.625 --> 01:18:59.666
-Okay.
-Unless…

01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:01.875
you're lying like me.

01:19:01.958 --> 01:19:03.833
The way I've been lying to you
all night long

01:19:03.916 --> 01:19:07.500
because then, truth be told,
it is a fucking art form.

01:19:10.333 --> 01:19:13.791
Don't feel bad. I've been bullshitting
everybody all night. Even him.

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:15.500
Till recently.

01:19:16.083 --> 01:19:17.291
Till just recently.

01:19:30.250 --> 01:19:31.833
You got something you want to tell me?

01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:35.416
-There never was any Crimestopper tip.
-No shit.

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:39.000
I got this from a burner
the night she was killed.

01:19:44.625 --> 01:19:45.958
Jackie sent this?

01:19:47.791 --> 01:19:49.666
You put this whole thing in play
on purpose?

01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:51.291
You gave me the idea.

01:19:51.875 --> 01:19:53.916
Bloody up the water,
see what rides to the surface.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Well, why didn't you fucking tell me?

01:19:56.083 --> 01:19:58.916
The only way to get everybody
to believe I'd actually steal the money

01:19:59.000 --> 01:19:59.916
is if you believed it.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:00.833
…fuckin' money…

01:20:00.916 --> 01:20:03.958
I made up the Crimestopper tip
to get all of us to the address she sent

01:20:04.041 --> 01:20:05.625
so we could see for ourselves.

01:20:05.708 --> 01:20:08.666
And maybe whoever killed her
would make a play.

01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:10.916
But J.D., man. The heist teams…

01:20:11.416 --> 01:20:14.458
-I think she was closing in.
-She was gonna use this Rip as bait.

01:20:14.541 --> 01:20:16.750
But they killed her
before she could put it in motion.

01:20:16.833 --> 01:20:17.958
Who?

01:20:18.458 --> 01:20:19.833
We're gonna find out tonight.

01:20:22.208 --> 01:20:23.541
But Mike Ro's with 'em.

01:20:24.166 --> 01:20:26.833
I had you from the second I heard "150K".

01:20:28.375 --> 01:20:30.416
Just needed to know
who you were working with.

01:20:32.208 --> 01:20:33.750
Where are the radios, Matty?

01:20:34.458 --> 01:20:35.833
-What?
-The radios?

01:20:36.958 --> 01:20:41.500
Why haven't we heard any pops?
Anything from dispatch? Any call-outs?

01:20:43.666 --> 01:20:48.291
We're taking $20 million across
North Miami. Who's fucking monitoring us?

01:20:48.375 --> 01:20:51.208
It's just us. Airtight, low-key.

01:20:52.458 --> 01:20:54.625
Why couldn't you bring
the BearCats out, Matty?

01:20:54.708 --> 01:20:55.750
Couldn't get them approved.

01:20:55.833 --> 01:20:56.833
Hmm.

01:20:57.333 --> 01:21:00.041
Yeah, where's your regular chalk?
Pop Squad?

01:21:00.125 --> 01:21:01.291
Where are those guys?
Where's Dayo?

01:21:01.375 --> 01:21:02.625
I sent him home.

01:21:02.708 --> 01:21:05.541
Again, no approval, zero overtime.
What is this, a fucking mystery?

01:21:05.625 --> 01:21:07.250
I told you how much was in the Rip.

01:21:07.333 --> 01:21:10.958
You also told me Dane was dirty
and might be wanting to steal it.

01:21:11.041 --> 01:21:12.416
Or I was acting like I did

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:14.833
to see who'd actually show up
and try to steal it.

01:21:17.833 --> 01:21:19.666
What are the odds
the Tahoe back there's got

01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:22.916
one or both of those Hialeah cops
we beefed with earlier?

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.041
Who's driving up front, man?
Anybody we know?

01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:30.541
-It was you who called the house.
-And shot it up.

01:21:33.250 --> 01:21:34.625
What the fuck is this?

01:21:35.250 --> 01:21:36.166
What the fuck is this?

01:21:36.250 --> 01:21:39.208
You trying to "two-and-two-is-four" me,
run up the flank? Fuck you both.

01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:41.416
Mike.

01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:44.541
Last chance, man. Make it count.

01:21:45.166 --> 01:21:46.958
Who else is moving on the money?

01:21:56.083 --> 01:21:57.750
You think I'm bent?

01:21:58.916 --> 01:21:59.875
Okay.

01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:04.166
Can I see that burner, Sarge?

01:22:21.833 --> 01:22:22.708
Redial.

01:22:49.625 --> 01:22:50.750
No!

01:22:55.291 --> 01:22:56.583
Down, down! Get down!

01:23:00.541 --> 01:23:02.208
You stay the fuck down!

01:23:11.541 --> 01:23:13.833
All right. We're fucking made.

01:23:14.583 --> 01:23:16.750
The move's out there.
It's all out in the fucking open now,

01:23:16.833 --> 01:23:18.333
so let's do something about it.

01:23:19.666 --> 01:23:21.166
We're good!

01:23:21.250 --> 01:23:23.916
We got something
we're working out in here.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.208
Get Dayo out of the front seat!

01:23:35.125 --> 01:23:36.708
Don't do any dumb shit, Detective.

01:23:50.083 --> 01:23:51.375
Nix, where the fuck am I going, man?

01:23:51.458 --> 01:23:54.708
This is fucking more money
than any one of us could ever spend.

01:23:54.791 --> 01:23:56.916
We mob up, we disappear in an hour…

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.583
We live like kings the rest of our lives.

01:24:00.333 --> 01:24:01.916
Except for this dumb fuck!

01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:04.666
You're gonna ride for the team, you fuck!

01:24:04.750 --> 01:24:07.041
Touch that gun, and I will kill you, J.D.

01:24:07.125 --> 01:24:10.375
I will fucking put a hole
right between your eyes.

01:24:10.458 --> 01:24:12.750
Nix, I have no fucking idea
where I'm going!

01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:14.583
What about Jackie?

01:24:14.666 --> 01:24:16.291
Did you kill her, Matty?

01:24:17.625 --> 01:24:18.666
Ro killed her!

01:24:18.750 --> 01:24:22.000
Fuck you, I did. Fuck you, I did.

01:24:22.083 --> 01:24:23.083
You shut the fuck up!

01:24:23.166 --> 01:24:26.541
You fucking pulled the trigger,
you fuck! You finished her!

01:24:41.208 --> 01:24:44.750
You finished her, you fuck!
You finished her!

01:24:44.833 --> 01:24:47.958
-Okay, let's focus.
-I gotta get this rig off the road, man!

01:24:48.041 --> 01:24:50.583
I can get fucking right.

01:24:53.791 --> 01:24:56.458
-What the fuck is that?
-You're gonna want me to take this.

01:25:07.625 --> 01:25:09.250
Go ahead. You're on speaker.

01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:11.916
Just got into position.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.166
Is that you
coming up the street right now?

01:25:14.250 --> 01:25:16.208
The Lenco, Tahoe behind you?

01:25:24.833 --> 01:25:28.541
-Yep, that's us. Where are you?
-We're right here.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.583
-Fucking… Who the fuck is that?
-It's my brother.

01:25:43.666 --> 01:25:44.750
Nix, what the fuck are we doing now?

01:25:44.833 --> 01:25:48.875
This is Special Agent Del Byrne
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

01:25:49.583 --> 01:25:53.000
I need everyone to exit the back
of the vehicle with your hands raised.

01:25:53.833 --> 01:25:55.125
It's over.

01:25:56.458 --> 01:25:58.833
-Put the gun down, man.
-Nix, I'm out.

01:25:58.916 --> 01:26:01.666
We're done. It's the feds.
It's the fucking feds out there.

01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:03.125
Here's what we're gonna do.

01:26:04.541 --> 01:26:07.791
We worked this thing together,
joint-agency, DEA and Dade, yeah?

01:26:08.291 --> 01:26:10.958
We took out the heist team, Ro,

01:26:12.166 --> 01:26:15.500
those Hialeah fucks, fucking ex-VCAT.

01:26:16.583 --> 01:26:18.166
This writes itself, guys.

01:26:18.250 --> 01:26:23.375
I repeat. Exit the back
of the vehicle with your hands raised.

01:26:23.458 --> 01:26:24.791
It's not gonna work, Nix.

01:26:24.875 --> 01:26:27.291
It's the fucking feds out there.
They're fucking everywhere.

01:26:27.375 --> 01:26:31.208
The fact is, no one wants this scandal.
No one needs more headlines. Instead,

01:26:32.291 --> 01:26:34.041
we fucking look like heroes.

01:26:34.791 --> 01:26:37.083
We took $20 million from the cartel

01:26:37.166 --> 01:26:39.500
and we're gonna gift it back
to the city of Miami?

01:26:41.041 --> 01:26:42.583
Let's think about this.

01:26:43.291 --> 01:26:45.291
This could be beautiful for us.

01:26:47.458 --> 01:26:48.958
Matty, they can hear you.

01:26:49.833 --> 01:26:51.583
I said, "You're on speaker."

01:26:53.083 --> 01:26:55.208
Agent Nix, how would you like this to go?

01:26:56.375 --> 01:26:57.625
-Fuck!
-Ro, stop!

01:26:57.708 --> 01:27:00.333
Get down, get down! Shit! No!

01:27:00.416 --> 01:27:02.291
Get on the ground now!

01:27:03.708 --> 01:27:05.708
-No, Mike, no!
-Ro!

01:27:10.875 --> 01:27:11.916
Shit!

01:27:22.666 --> 01:27:23.875
Take that rig!

01:27:46.166 --> 01:27:47.875
-Hands, hands!
-Where? Where'd he go?

01:27:53.625 --> 01:27:55.333
Hey! Hey, J.D.!

01:27:56.125 --> 01:27:59.166
J.D.! That's my fucking car, man!

01:28:24.333 --> 01:28:25.166
Fuck.

01:29:19.666 --> 01:29:20.625
Fuck you!

01:29:46.916 --> 01:29:48.083
Oof!

01:29:53.875 --> 01:29:54.708
Fuck!

01:31:34.583 --> 01:31:35.458
Stop.

01:31:37.875 --> 01:31:39.083
Mike!

01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:44.666
Stop it.

01:32:06.750 --> 01:32:07.750
Fuck.

01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:16.083
Fuck! Fuck!

01:32:28.166 --> 01:32:29.291
Goddamn it, Mike.

01:32:32.875 --> 01:32:34.916
Do you think I'm a piece of shit?

01:32:36.666 --> 01:32:38.000
What amount of money?

01:32:38.583 --> 01:32:41.208
What fucking amount of money?
I will cut you in. Huh?

01:32:41.291 --> 01:32:42.666
Let's work here. Come on.

01:32:42.750 --> 01:32:44.041
How much you got?

01:32:45.333 --> 01:32:47.083
Price of a Miami police captain?

01:33:55.416 --> 01:33:56.500
You get it now?

01:34:06.875 --> 01:34:08.541
Are you gonna execute me?

01:34:15.958 --> 01:34:17.583
It's moving fast, man.

01:34:20.833 --> 01:34:22.250
Wake up one day,

01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:24.625
you're old.

01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:39.791
Let's go.

01:36:23.541 --> 01:36:25.333
-Okay, sign off on this here.
-Got it.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.250
There has to be like… at least…

01:36:31.166 --> 01:36:33.333
Hey, they're on my ass.
I need that number.

01:36:33.416 --> 01:36:34.250
Got it.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.791
-Detective Salazar?
-Yeah.

01:36:38.875 --> 01:36:41.166
You have verbal confirmation
of your count?

01:36:41.250 --> 01:36:42.375
Yes.

01:36:43.458 --> 01:36:44.500
Yes.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.208
20,650,480.

01:36:53.875 --> 01:36:54.875
Detective Baptiste.

01:36:55.625 --> 01:36:56.625
You have a number for me?

01:36:57.125 --> 01:36:59.541
20,650,480.

01:37:03.625 --> 01:37:04.666
Lieutenant Dumars.

01:37:05.375 --> 01:37:06.750
You have written confirmation
of your count?

01:37:06.833 --> 01:37:07.916
Yep. Got it.

01:37:32.208 --> 01:37:33.416
Hey, good evening.

01:37:34.541 --> 01:37:35.666
Or morning.

01:37:36.958 --> 01:37:38.333
You'll be happy with that.

01:37:52.125 --> 01:37:53.166
Wow.

01:37:54.791 --> 01:37:56.166
To the dollar.

01:37:57.458 --> 01:38:00.125
Well done, Detectives. Well done.

01:38:05.166 --> 01:38:06.458
That's one solid Rip.

01:38:07.583 --> 01:38:09.625
Clear this place out. Mop it up.

01:38:09.708 --> 01:38:10.875
Roger that.

01:38:11.666 --> 01:38:14.375
Did he just say "one solid Rip"?

01:38:29.125 --> 01:38:30.375
-Holy shit.
-Oh, boy.

01:38:30.458 --> 01:38:32.083
She's getting a piece
of the fucking seizure.

01:38:32.166 --> 01:38:33.083
Oh, my God.

01:38:33.166 --> 01:38:34.333
-Wow.
-Well, shit, good for her.

01:38:35.708 --> 01:38:38.166
Her abuela's house
burnt down. She can have it.

01:38:38.250 --> 01:38:40.791
Well, babies, we did it. We did that shit.

01:38:40.875 --> 01:38:42.666
-Yeah, we did.
-Yes, we fucking did.

01:38:43.583 --> 01:38:46.500
You guys were great.
You guys were just great.

01:38:47.041 --> 01:38:48.000
Jackie'd be proud.

01:38:48.083 --> 01:38:50.583
I really feel like
she made that happen from beyond.

01:38:50.666 --> 01:38:52.208
She had that bruja thing.

01:38:53.458 --> 01:38:54.666
All right.

01:38:55.375 --> 01:38:57.125
-Yeah.
-I'm about to blow this popsicle stand.

01:38:57.208 --> 01:38:59.833
I got a real hot shower
and a big-ass empty bed

01:38:59.916 --> 01:39:02.458
that is waiting for big mama
to get home. I gotta go.

01:39:03.750 --> 01:39:05.583
Mm!

01:39:06.750 --> 01:39:08.875
-My leg…
-All right, get some rest.

01:39:09.833 --> 01:39:11.208
I'll see you guys.

01:39:11.291 --> 01:39:13.208
-Go see the girls.
-All right, how you getting home?

01:39:13.291 --> 01:39:14.125
-Bye.
-You take care.

01:39:14.208 --> 01:39:16.333
Oh, you ain't heard?
DEA's putting us in Uber.

01:39:16.416 --> 01:39:19.375
Uber Black, to be exact.
Real classy shit, you know?

01:39:19.458 --> 01:39:20.875
Bye, boss.

01:39:21.458 --> 01:39:22.333
-Say hi to the girls.
-I'm tired.

01:39:22.416 --> 01:39:23.291
I will.

01:39:24.625 --> 01:39:25.833
Let's go, papa.

01:39:26.583 --> 01:39:29.541
She get 20% of that Rip.
That's four million dollars.

01:39:30.166 --> 01:39:31.333
Yeah, looks like it.

01:39:31.416 --> 01:39:33.583
I mean, the IRS
is gonna take half of it, right?

01:39:33.666 --> 01:39:36.458
But yeah, she'll do all right.
Not a bad night's work.

01:39:36.541 --> 01:39:38.708
Yeah. If you can fucking get it.

01:39:38.791 --> 01:39:40.750
Yeah.

01:39:40.833 --> 01:39:43.875
Congratulations, Del. Did your job.

01:39:43.958 --> 01:39:47.791
Yeah, I did. Did your job too,
motherfucker. Thank me later.

01:39:48.291 --> 01:39:50.958
Hey. I'm sorry about yesterday.

01:39:51.041 --> 01:39:52.375
I'm sorry. I said it.

01:39:52.458 --> 01:39:54.625
-What, you want… You want a hug?
-Yeah, I want a hug.

01:39:54.708 --> 01:39:56.416
-No, I'm not hugging you.
-Give your big brother a hug.

01:39:56.500 --> 01:39:58.541
-I'm not hugging you, J.D.
-Hug your big brother who loves you.

01:39:58.625 --> 01:40:00.333
Back up. No chance. Get fucked.

01:40:00.416 --> 01:40:04.041
Come on. Hey, hug your brother
who loves you in front of all the feds.

01:40:04.125 --> 01:40:06.291
Come here. He's a bully, but he loves you.

01:40:06.375 --> 01:40:08.208
You're a fucking asshole, you know that?

01:40:08.291 --> 01:40:10.125
-You're an asshole too, but I love you.
-Yeah?

01:40:10.791 --> 01:40:12.500
-All right. Thanks, man.
-You okay, though?

01:40:12.583 --> 01:40:14.041
-Yeah.
-You sure?

01:40:15.375 --> 01:40:16.833
-Yeah.
-Okay.

01:40:18.083 --> 01:40:21.041
Hey, I'm gonna stop by Mom's later
for a cup of coffee,

01:40:21.125 --> 01:40:24.708
and just so you know, I'm gonna
take credit for fucking everything.

01:40:24.791 --> 01:40:25.875
-Oh, I know.
-All of it.

01:40:25.958 --> 01:40:27.375
-Why change? Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:40:27.458 --> 01:40:28.708
And you owe me a new car too.

01:40:28.791 --> 01:40:29.958
All right.

01:40:30.708 --> 01:40:33.000
Congratulations, kid.
Don't spend it all in one place.

01:40:33.083 --> 01:40:33.916
Thanks.

01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:37.416
Stop fucking around. I know you got
beer around here somewhere.

01:40:42.958 --> 01:40:43.791
Thank you.

01:40:45.958 --> 01:40:48.416
You knew I'd tell Ro everything,
didn't you?

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.125
Yeah, yeah.
I knew you'd do the right thing,

01:40:52.875 --> 01:40:54.125
even if it put you in danger.

01:40:58.125 --> 01:40:59.208
That, um…

01:41:01.708 --> 01:41:04.083
That captain, that policewoman
that was murdered,

01:41:04.666 --> 01:41:05.791
the one that I talked to…

01:41:06.333 --> 01:41:08.333
-Jackie.
-Yeah, Jackie.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:13.208
I don't know.
Through all this shit, she got us to you.

01:41:13.833 --> 01:41:16.666
-Is that weird to you?
-No, no.

01:41:16.750 --> 01:41:18.791
And if you knew Jackie…

01:41:20.708 --> 01:41:21.583
She'd…

01:41:22.333 --> 01:41:24.291
She'd say it was meant to happen that way.

01:41:26.708 --> 01:41:27.875
Then maybe it was.

01:41:28.916 --> 01:41:29.750
Yeah.

01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:37.875
Oh, you wanna know what they mean.

01:41:41.458 --> 01:41:42.541
"Are we the good guys?"

01:41:49.125 --> 01:41:51.166
Last thing, uh, my son said to me.

01:41:56.333 --> 01:41:57.666
"We are and always will be."

01:42:03.041 --> 01:42:04.791
Last thing I said to my son.

01:42:09.625 --> 01:42:10.500
How?

01:42:13.458 --> 01:42:14.958
Cancer, uh…

01:42:16.500 --> 01:42:18.500
He was ten years old. Jake.

01:42:27.083 --> 01:42:31.125
All right, Desiree Lopez Molina.
Stay the fuck out of trouble.

01:43:07.916 --> 01:43:09.625
Great work today, man.

01:43:11.250 --> 01:43:12.416
You, too.

01:43:44.625 --> 01:43:46.625
Look at the sunrise!

01:43:50.208 --> 01:43:51.500
So pretty!

01:43:51.583 --> 01:43:53.250
Imagine being that fired up for a sunrise.

01:43:53.333 --> 01:43:55.666
That's great. That's great.

01:44:04.250 --> 01:44:05.583
Jackie!

01:44:12.166 --> 01:44:14.208
Jackie, where are you, baby?

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:16.166
I'm right here!
