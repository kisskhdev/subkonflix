WEBVTT

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.710
Come on, slow down, slow down.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.430
Come, Jizi, sit.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.230
No, no, no.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.230
Division Commander, you sit, you sit.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.150
Just sit down.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.120
You, you...

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.040
If I tell you to sit, just sit.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.870
Here are paper and a pen.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.710
Just write down everything from

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.400
leaving the camp to returning.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.230
Who you met,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.920
what was said,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.590
and what happened.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.510
Including eating, drinking, shitting, and sleeping.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.430
How many times you used the latrine.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.000
Write it all down clearly for me.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Plain and simple.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.560
If there's any lying or hiding...

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.120
Division Commander, I understand, I understand.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.240
If I can't even pass this test,

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.360
you wouldn't believe

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.910
I could pass Division Commander Liao's test.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.750
Good brother.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.280
You've worked hard.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.870
Young Mistress! Young Mistress!

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.310
We found the Eldest Young Master.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.310
Really?

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:41.630
Master Wen.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.190
How is Sha'er?

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.910
Is he okay? Has he lost weight?

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.590
Did he get sick being out there alone?

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.870
Did he suffer a lot?

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.630
He is doing very well.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.360
I saw him, and he's even gained weight.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.800
Eldest Young Master is capable.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.310
He opened a hotpot restaurant.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.150
Opening branches everywhere.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.190
He's also quite lucky with the ladies.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.190
He's almost settled down out there.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.120
Yu Zhen.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.360
I came specifically to tell you,

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.960
I delivered the message you asked me to.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.960
Rest assured.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.840
Young Master Fan misses you too.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.870
He said he will definitely come back.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:15.800
Then why

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.800
didn't he come back with you?

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.030
When we parted ways,

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.520
something unexpected happened.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.470
What his situation is now,

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.240
we don't know either.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.080
That's right.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.310
He asked me to escort Troupe Leader Wen back.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.840
The situation was urgent.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.680
Heaven watches over the lucky ones.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.190
Once he handles it, he will return.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.190
You said

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.910
he opened a hotpot restaurant.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.520
What is the name of that place?

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:45.680
Dongshihui.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.400
Why aren't you in the kitchen frying the base?

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.840
You just guard the door all day.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.680
He's the one who injured Commander Qin.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.800
But the medical bills fall on us two.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.840
You still expect him to come back?

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.800
If he doesn't come back,

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.120
I will go find him.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.590
You damn girl.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.030
You don't run our business properly,

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.360
just thinking about running off.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.360
Is it even our business anymore?

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.080
The money all goes into Commander Qin's pocket.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.360
I'm done frying the base for him.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:23.750
Tell Gan Xia'er to go.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.360
Since you know Gan Xia'er is a spy from across the street,

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.360
why do you still keep him?

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.000
Gan Xia'er is already an outcast over there.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.680
If I kick him out too,

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.750
his old mother won't have anywhere to get medicine.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:40.800
I believe

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.720
this is also what Brother Fan would want.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.600
He knows to care for his old mother,

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.070
so you should think about your old man too.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.680
It's precisely because you have the secret recipe

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.950
that Commander Qin hasn't dared to harm us.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.240
If our business collapses,

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:02.950
in this town,

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.070
we won't be able to stay.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.830
Have a drink

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.720
Don't listen to his nonsense

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.920
That Scarface is just a punk

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.600
When you were being buried alive...

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.310
It wasn't that I didn't want to save you

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.750
There were so many people there

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.160
I couldn't do anything

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.430
Besides...

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.630
I really didn't steal your family's grain

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.920
Let's not talk about that

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.160
How did you become a bandit?

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.270
It's all because of you

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:46.950
Knowing you weren't dead...

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.430
I led the brothers everywhere looking for you

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.510
While we were searching...

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.560
We got abducted here and became bandits

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.560
So it's my fault?

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:56.480
Then let me out

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.510
Let's escape together

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.270
If I could escape, I would have long ago

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:00.510
I'm locked up here

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.160
We're going to die anyway

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:04.630
I'm not gonna die

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.120
Someone's coming

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.920
Brother Fan

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.310
Brother Scar

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.950
Brother Fan...

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.480
Is there something you haven't confessed?

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:36.310
Brother Fan

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:37.680
I'm asking if you...

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.070
...haven't confessed something

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:41.070
I...

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.680
...have confessed everything

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.720
That's strange then

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.750
This place is short on manpower

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.600
Usually they don't kill newcomers

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.600
Just tell me the honest truth

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.160
So I can go plead for you

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.190
You're a real man too

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.240
Do you remember my favor?

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:58.830
I do

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:59.750
Do you appreciate my help?

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:00.240
I do

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.360
Will you take me to escape?

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.920
Escape my ass

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.680
Tiger Ma is ruthless

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.190
The terrain here is complex

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:08.830
There's no way in hell to escape

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.240
Stop talking nonsense

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:33.950
This is the last meal.

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:35.510
I got you something good to eat.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.390
We're about to die anyway.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.560
How can I eat anything?

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:45.720
You still have to eat.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.360
Or you'll become a starving ghost.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.240
The two of us...

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.560
let's eat together.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.040
You don't even know me.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.240
Yet you ask me to eat with you.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.310
Anyway...

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:56.800
you're not a bandit.

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:58.510
Look at your face.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.480
You have delicate features.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.270
You must be a good person.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.480
Probably just like me.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.360
A fellow sufferer wandering the world.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.360
Where are you from, and where are you going?

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.390
A fortune teller told me to head west.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.630
I kept walking and ended up here.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.950
You actually believe in fate?

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.190
I don't believe in fate.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.560
But...

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.800
I have nowhere else to go.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.600
A young girl like you...

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:34.750
surviving in a place like this...

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.680
must have suffered a lot.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.750
How did you get here?

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:43.240
I was supposed to get married.

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:45.120
But the elders in my family...

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.600
offended someone powerful.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.030
To appease his anger...

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.000
they offered me to him.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:54.670
So he wouldn't kill everyone.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.790
After he tortured me enough...

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.720
he negotiated with the bandits...

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.630
and sent me here as a bargaining chip.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.550
How pitiful.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.750
How tragic.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.840
If only you'd met me sooner.

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:11.390
Otherwise...

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.440
I would have taken revenge for you.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:15.270
We aren't related or anything.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.960
You'd be willing to take revenge for me?

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.750
My ambition is to rob the rich to help the poor.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.630
And enforce justice on behalf of Heaven.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:23.720
Really?

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:25.240
Right now...

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.270
I can barely save myself.

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:28.440
I can let you out.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:30.030
No, no, no.

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:32.000
If you let me out...

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:33.870
it'll get you in trouble.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.390
As long as you're willing to avenge me.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:41.720
Alright.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.600
Then let's leave together.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:47.440
Alright.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.750
I'll go check if anyone's there.

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:49.550
Okay.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:56.790
Quick, no one's there.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:57.480
Let's go.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.270
This way is blocked.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:11.440
Go that way.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.320
We can't go there.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.630
Then where?

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:17.840
Come on.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:47.320
There are two people there.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.480
Let's climb down the wall over there.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:50.840
Okay.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:51.550
Let's go.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.960
There's a rope here.

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:00.550
Go this way.

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:02.200
Going that way just takes you back, doesn't it?

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:10.360
You're so strong.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.390
It's so scary.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.720
I'm scared to go down.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.790
Then I'll go down first.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.670
I'll catch you at the bottom.

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:18.480
Alright.

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:31.750
Come down, quick.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:32.870
Okay.

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:35.750
Be careful.

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:38.200
I've got you.

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:47.790
What was that?

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:49.840
Who's there?

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:50.960
What else could it be?

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:52.080
Must be a wild boar.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.150
Go patrol over there.

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:01.390
Let's go.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.630
I can't walk anymore.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.390
I hurt my foot.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.750
I'll carry you. Get up.

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:20.480
Division Commander.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.670
I've finished writing.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.480
It's very detailed.

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:38.480
Good.

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:40.000
Is it?

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:41.510
Write it again.

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:46.720
Write a better version.

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:00.750
You won't get away carrying me like this.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.390
Escape or not, we have to run.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.840
But...

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.240
I really can't take it anymore right now.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.080
Let's rest a bit first.

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:13.390
I...

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:15.320
I really can't walk anymore.

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:17.200
Why don't you go on ahead?

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:19.030
How is that possible?

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:20.870
You saved me.

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:22.910
How could I possibly leave you...

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:23.790
...all alone here?

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.120
Besides...

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:26.670
...a young girl...

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.910
...in a bandit's den...

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.510
...that just wouldn't be right.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:32.870
Let's try first.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.480
See if you can walk.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:40.630
I'll help you, let's walk a bit.

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:41.510
Let's go.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.750
Is it any better?

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.870
It still hurts.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.960
I'd better just carry you.

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:57.440
Climb up yourself.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.120
Okay.

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:02.600
You call that climbing?

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:04.600
You're pouncing on me!

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.120
How come...

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.750
...you're heavier than before?

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.080
Which way do we go?

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:12.550
Go that way. Over there.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.240
You pressed on my funny bone.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.960
Laugh a little quieter.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.670
Do you know how to massage?

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:30.750
Us wandering practitioners...

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.030
...have to know a little bit of everything.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.320
A young girl like you...

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:39.030
...if I don't cure you...

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.960
...it'd be a shame if you ended up crippled.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.870
Plus I have to take you on the run.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.720
This bird's nest hair of yours...

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:10.270
...looks too ugly.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:11.480
Come here, come here.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.550
Let me comb it for you.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.080
You know how to braid hair?

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:30.440
I used to braid my Missus's hair.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.480
Young girls...

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:24.200
...look good with two braids.

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:28.030
Here.

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:35.000
Here.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.080
I'll eat this one.

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:38.080
Okay.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.630
Then I'll eat the mushrooms.

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:44.360
So...

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.030
...where are we running to next?

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:49.390
We'll go find the garrison.

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:50.440
We can't go there.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.000
What I mean is...

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.360
...whether we can escape or not...

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.440
...we don't even know yet.

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:01.030
Only the army can fight bandits.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.360
I've been thinking...

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:05.080
...that fortune teller...

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.960
...told me to keep going west.

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.870
If I see someone with a gun, report to them.

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:10.270
People with guns...

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.310
...if not bandits...

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.070
...must be the army.

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:16.270
Not necessarily.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.790
He told me to join the army.

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:19.920
Join the army?

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:22.000
Would they even recognize you?

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:23.790
He gave me a...

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.920
...thing with a tiger head emblem drawn on it.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.030
That might be a token of proof.

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:30.200
Yeah.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.880
This tiger head emblem...

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:35.270
...I actually saw it...

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:37.400
...on a soldier before.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:39.480
You saw it? Where?

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.000
It was on my sworn brother.

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.110
What's his name?

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:45.200
His surname is Wei, called Wei San'er.

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:49.640
I saw it when we were bathing together.

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:51.680
Brother.

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.830
Big Brother.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.110
On the back of his hand...

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:01.880
...there was a tiger head emblem pattern.

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:03.480
But...

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:05.880
I can't...

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:09.200
I'm not sure...

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.400
...if it's the same one.

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:20.590
Wei San'er...

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:24.790
...how could a fortune teller know him?

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.110
So...

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.790
...are you still going to help me get revenge?

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:40.160
I will.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.510
Mushrooms on the mountain...

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.350
...how can you just eat them randomly?

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.270
How did I end up back here?

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.440
Where is that little girl?

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.070
Where is that little girl?

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.790
That little girl...

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.960
I was the one who tricked her into going out.

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:51.640
Don't blame her.

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:55.720
Big Brother.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:57.750
Do me a favor.

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:59.400
Let that little girl go.

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:37.400
Boss Ma.

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:50.830
Do I look good?

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:52.680
Boss Ma.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.350
You are Tiger Ma?

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:55.310
Who else?

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.640
I think...

00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:59.270
little girl,

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:01.590
you'd look better with two braids.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.240
You look like a bad guy like this.

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:06.200
Then do you think...

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:08.000
I'm a good person?

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.590
Anyway, you're not a bad guy.

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:13.640
Let him go.

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:14.440
Yes.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.160
Come here.

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:18.070
Shut your mouth.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.400
Boss Ma.

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:23.590
He is a little brother of mine.

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.270
When I roamed the world...

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:26.440
he was always following me.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.070
He has no bad intentions.

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:29.070
Look...

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.270
can we add him to my squad?

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:33.750
I'll definitely take him and teach him the rules properly.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.240
Why should he follow you?

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:38.270
Logically speaking, he and I are old acquaintances too.

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:39.880
Based on the headcount...

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.590
he should be assigned to my squad.

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:42.350
You're everywhere, aren't you?

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:43.030
What about it?

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:44.160
He should be killed.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:47.550
Why is it as soon as you speak,

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:49.110
it's all about killing this and that?

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:50.720
Who are you?

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.640
Who do you think you are?

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:55.880
Boss Ma hasn't even spoken yet.

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:58.310
And here you are jabbering away.

00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:59.240
Let me ask you.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.070
You guys...

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:02.590
Boss Ma...

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.110
when she twisted her ankle...

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:06.920
where were you all?

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.030
When Boss Ma was hungry...

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:10.960
where were you all?

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:12.350
Boss Ma and I...

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:14.480
have shared hardships together.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.440
Actually,

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:25.880
my coming up here was a misunderstanding.

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:28.680
But with so many brothers here...

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.830
It's fate, after all

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:32.720
If you were to kill me

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:35.590
it would ruin your feng shui

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.030
So what about his men?

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.790
So what if I am his man?

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.240
Actually, we are all

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:43.830
Boss Ma's men

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:46.000
Well said

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.720
Since you want to be one of my men

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:49.310
I'll grant your wish

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.310
Then I appoint you as

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.640
Strategist

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:54.510
From now on

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.310
you answer only to me

00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:59.350
Strategist

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:00.920
That won't do

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.200
Isn't he going to boss us around?

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:04.680
This won't work

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:06.110
That won't work either

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:07.680
You're really hard to please

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:08.960
He already said

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.510
it's fate, isn't it?

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:12.240
Will you take the job?

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.830
How am I worthy of this?

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.720
Becoming an officer right upon arrival

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.590
As expected of Brother Fan

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.440
Brother Fan really is impressive

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:24.400
Congratulations, congratulations

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.350
Same to you, same to you

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:26.070
Brother Fan

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:28.270
I'll be relying on you from now on

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:29.480
We'll look out for each other

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:30.750
Brother Fan

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:32.830
You really are formidable

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:34.750
What's all the noise? Shut up

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:41.350
If my brother becomes an officer, I fully support it

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:43.110
But to convince everyone

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:44.920
you might need to submit a Proof of loyalty

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.550
What kind of mess are you stirring up now?

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:47.720
None of your damn business

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.550
I know my brother

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:51.270
Since he is the Strategist

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:52.750
he should lead everyone on a job

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.400
So you can all get a good look at

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.720
my brother's resourcefulness

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:57.920
Big Brother

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:00.880
You used to be the leader

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.400
and we just followed behind your butt

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:04.200
No, no, no

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:06.240
Your past glory is not worth mentioning.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.030
Now that Boss Ma thinks highly of you,

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.440
you must live up to

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.750
Boss Ma's trust in you.

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.030
This proposal works.

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:17.240
If it fails,

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.110
you'll get a spanking.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.240
Understood.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.270
Yes.

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:24.960
So you're willing to believe me now?

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.270
Your three reports are basically consistent.

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:30.550
Which means it really happened.

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:31.750
Drink water. Drink up.

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:38.920
That Lucky General mentioned in your reports...

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:40.480
Is he really that formidable?

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:42.880
That man is really capable.

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.000
No matter how dangerous the situation,

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.240
he can resolve it.

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:48.240
The key is that he is righteous,

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.160
and decisive in action.

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.550
He's general material.

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.350
However,

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:55.310
I'm not sure if he's willing to join the army.

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:56.680
I was afraid if I mentioned it right away,

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.590
and scared him off, it would be trouble.

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:01.200
So I only gave him a token,

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:02.680
and pointed him in a direction.

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.790
Thinking I'd trick him into coming here first,

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.110
then slowly convince him to serve you.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.720
If he's really as formidable as you say,

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.830
and gets poached by other forces,

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.550
that would be a bit troublesome.

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:16.640
Division Commander,

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:17.960
rest assured on this.

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:19.680
With my friendship with him,

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:20.790
it's a sure thing.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.110
You're that sure?

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.400
If you are anxious,

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.830
I'll go out right now and bring him back.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.440
What if you run off too?

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:28.750
How could I possibly run?

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:29.480
Division Commander,

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.110
you just said you trusted me.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:37.590
You said you pointed him in a direction.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.310
Yes.

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:40.000
And gave him a token.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:40.750
Yes.

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:44.640
But the man just hasn't arrived.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.240
And I don't feel safe letting you go out again.

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:52.920
I don't want you risking yourself.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.160
The only plan for now

00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:59.480
is to wait.

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:00.680
That works too.

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:03.880
I have a good idea.

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:05.000
Division Commander, please speak.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.510
If he doesn't arrive in three more days,

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.400
you skip one meal.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.510
If he doesn't arrive in six days,

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.400
you skip two meals.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.160
Until he shows up.

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:16.790
When that time comes, I'll throw you a huge banquet,

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:17.880
and you can eat to your heart's content.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.640
If he doesn't come for a month...

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:20.550
Don't say a month,

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:22.400
I'd starve to death in half a month.

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:23.480
How is that possible?

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.350
You and I are brothers, brothers for life.

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:26.680
I'd whip up some rice soup,

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.200
just to keep you alive.

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:30.480
Doesn't this count as torture?

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:34.510
You're coughing, go see a doctor.

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:35.480
Exactly.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.310
This is the merchant caravan.

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:42.480
This is us.

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:46.160
This is you guys.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.590
Who is this?

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:49.270
This...

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.480
This is a tree branch.

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.070
Then where am I?

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.240
You want to go?

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:57.830
It's his first time commanding, he has no experience.

00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:58.920
It's still very dangerous.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.350
That's why I must go even more.

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:01.680
If he runs into trouble,

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.160
I can remedy it in time.

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.400
I'm here, aren't I?

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:06.400
You wait at home for the good news.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.200
If we really encounter danger,

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:10.920
won't you just protect me?

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:14.960
I'll protect you with my life.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:16.510
Good.

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:18.200
Brother Fan.

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:20.310
Merchant caravans are very alert nowadays.

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:22.350
At the slightest disturbance,

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:23.310
they run away immediately.

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.480
Do you have any way

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:25.960
to catch these people off guard?

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:30.480
I'll have my own way when the time comes.

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:48.680
Here they come! Here they come!

00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:51.000
Hurry up!

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.680
Enemies are bound to meet.

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:04.550
Keep those three.

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:11.590
Get ready.

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:18.880
Cut them down!

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.070
Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.000
Go, go!

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.400
Don't move!

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:37.400
Squat down!

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.160
Check for survivors first.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.110
Are you asleep?

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:49.440
No.

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.510
Then are you hurt?

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:52.640
No.

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:55.750
Then what's wrong with you?

00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:58.440
I faint at the sight of blood.

00:29:58.790 --> 00:29:59.720
Thanks to you,

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.240
the brothers can have a few good meals again.

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:07.400
Pack up.

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:09.400
Let's go, let's go!

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:15.440
Keep up in the back!

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.550
Let's go, Brother Fan.

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:20.550
You'll get used to it.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.110
Those three men...

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.480
what are we taking them back for?

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.200
To sleep with Tiger Ma.

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:28.750
Nonsense.

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:30.480
What do you mean nonsense? I'm not talking nonsense!

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:31.790
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.790
Big Brother went into Tiger Ma's bedroom.

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.480
After he came out, he was

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.030
head over heels for Tiger Ma.

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.480
I heard Tiger Ma is organizing

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.510
her own Suicide Squad.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.350
Big Brother was the one selected.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.680
But what they did inside the bedroom,

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.510
or what mission the Suicide Squad has,

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:46.350
nobody knows.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.480
Let's go, let's go.
