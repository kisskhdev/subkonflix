00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.750
Want to get a gym membership?

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.110
15% off for new members.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.270
Weren't you working in the car shop?

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.550
You're the boss
who bought a car from me!

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:05.550
Hi!

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.030
You're not selling cars anymore?

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.591
Why are you distributing fliers here?

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.230
My sales record didn't make the cut,

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.350
so I got fired.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.740
You didn't make the cut?

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.300
You just sold a car two days ago, right?

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.670
That's the only car I've sold.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.070
Understood.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.140
Are you interested

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.420
in a new job?

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.300
Hello.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.230
I'm the new manager, Tian Mo.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.990
Hello.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.020
I'm Li Yaling.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.300
Let's take a tour.

00:02:53.813 --> 00:02:55.230
That's right. I have a question.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.460
Xingniao Gym is a chain

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.057
but many of its branches closed down.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.390
However, Mr. Pei insists

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.790
on acquiring our headquarters.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.230
Does he intend
to run this gym seriously?

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.350
Mr. Pei said he was serious.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:10.900
Why did I hear him say

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.791
he wants
to replace all the equipment here

00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:13.670
for new ones?

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.020
Actually, our equipment here

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.900
is already the best in the industry,

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.270
and they are well maintained.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:19.740
So, I think

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.550
we can continue using it.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.350
But Mr. Pei wants to replace everything.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:26.950
What about the members?

00:03:27.035 --> 00:03:29.591
I heard he wouldn't
accept all the original members.

00:03:29.746 --> 00:03:31.457
He wanted to transfer them
to other branches

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.546
and pay the compensation
for breaching the contract.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.950
Should you discuss this with him?

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.740
Mr. Pei insists on the transfer.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.860
Compared to our last manager, you are

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:45.740
more gentle.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.070
But let me tell you.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.860
It's not easy working in this industry.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.110
Really?

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.550
Look.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.580
Where is this gym located?

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.700
The CBD.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.990
Every inch of land is expensive.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.390
The rent is unimaginably high.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.700
Look at the fitness equipment.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.700
If Mr. Pei is
going to replace everything,

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:13.950
do you know how much it'll cost?

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.300
More than a million yuan.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:16.790
The pool.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.260
Do you see anyone using it?

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.710
Only a few use it a month

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:21.550
but you need to maintain it every day.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.350
Next, personal trainers.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.180
Do you think everyone

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.590
can attract members just like me?

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.550
But you still need
to pay their salaries.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.990
Tell me.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.150
Who will be the one

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.550
taking all these responsibilities?

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.550
Who?

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.260
Selling classes?

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.300
It's doing sales all over again.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.230
What else do you think?

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.620
Personal trainers are doing sales.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.790
I'm planning to resign anyway.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.910
I won't be working
in this industry anymore.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.860
Why am I going back to doing sales?

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.030
That's right, Ms. Yaling.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.230
Mr. Pei asked me to tell you

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.550
that no matter what you say,

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.110
he will pay you triple

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.670
with no sales requirements.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:05.940
Pay me triple

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.790
with no sales requirements?

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.500
Then, I think

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.350
I can still work

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.590
in this industry.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.590
Then,

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:18.740
how does Mr. Pei

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.180

(Xingniao Gym)
Can't I apply for a membership?

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.030
No. That's not it, Sir.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.346
Our boss doesn't need you

00:06:00.368 --> 00:06:02.670
to apply for a monthly,
seasonal, or annual membership.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.790
Fine. You still don't let me
apply for a membership.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.590
This is a huge gym, but you don't allow
me to apply for a membership.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:08.670
What's the meaning of this?

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:09.590
Sir,

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.110
let me explain it to you.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.300
Our gym has no memberships.

00:06:13.324 --> 00:06:14.590
If you apply for a membership

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:15.790
and don't visit often,

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:16.813
wouldn't that be a waste?

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.940
We only charge by visits.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.110
If you visit one day,
you'll pay for one day.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.350
After you are done working out,

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.230
just scan the QR code to pay.

You should've said that sooner.

Let me scan the QR code.

Manager,

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.380
is there a personal trainer here?

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.260
I can pay for a personal trainer.

00:06:45.613 --> 00:06:46.657
Sir, sorry.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.946
As requested by our boss,
please do your own workout.

00:06:48.946 --> 00:06:51.230
We don't provide
any personal trainer services.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:56.230
That's...

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.299

Manager Tian,

00:07:23.213 --> 00:07:24.746
my whole career before this tells me

00:07:24.746 --> 00:07:27.020
that Mr. Pei is going in
the completely opposite direction.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.470
Customers come to work out

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.030
to build muscles and lose fat.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:31.790
Moreover, most customers

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:34.470
can only achieve this goal
through the coach's restrictions.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:35.524
Mr. Pei's arrangements

00:07:35.546 --> 00:07:38.230
are going in the opposite direction
from the customers' needs.

00:07:39.013 --> 00:07:40.613
Didn't you say the gym business

00:07:40.635 --> 00:07:42.924
is a business
where the bad crowd out the good?

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.550
Perhaps Mr. Pei is trying
to change this industry.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.340
My years of working experience
have crumbled.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:55.350
But Mr. Pei insists on doing this.

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.860
It's not enough
to have me alone as the trainer.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.790
All the previous trainers resigned.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:02.990
We must hire some new ones.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.470
Mr. Pei says
he already has candidates in mind.

00:08:08.635 --> 00:08:10.302
- Hello, Manager Tian.
- Hello, Manager Tian.

00:08:10.324 --> 00:08:12.550
- Everyone is ready.
- Everyone is ready.

Ms. Yaling.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:28.740
Are these the coaches hired by Mr. Pei?

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:30.230
Mr. Pei said

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.140
these were the elites
of DreamForge Capital.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:35.500
Come on.

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:42.860
They might look thin

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:44.070
but perhaps

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:46.470
they are good at getting sales?

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:47.470
Help me out.

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:48.470
Try harder!

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:49.830
Harder!

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:54.470
That's amazing.

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:22.110
Where's everyone?

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:25.620
Where's everyone?

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:29.380
Where's everyone?

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:30.860
I'm here.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.230
Why isn't anyone here?

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:33.590
Someone's here.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:34.950
Where's everyone?

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:35.830

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:36.710
Where's...

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:39.740
You scared me.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:42.710
Where's everyone?

00:09:44.831 --> 00:09:46.740
Mr. Pei said the gym is opening

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:47.710
and needs manpower.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:48.702
He took them all away.

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:51.350
Yes.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.280
Our shared phone booth project
has already been decided.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.620
We should indeed put

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:57.350
more focus

00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:58.500
on the gym.

00:09:59.057 --> 00:10:00.457
Everyone needs to go there.

00:10:01.813 --> 00:10:03.430
Tang, are you fine with the workload?

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:08.350
I'm fine.

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:09.470
I'm relieved to hear that.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:11.660
These juniors of mine

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.350
should finally start training.

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:15.590
They should train a little, at least.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:17.590
All right!

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:22.620
What a lunatic.

(DreamForge Capital)

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:53.540
Tian,

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.740
should we give out some flyers?

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:57.900
We will be officially open soon.

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:01.413
But Mr. Pei asked us not to do anything.

00:11:01.457 --> 00:11:03.450
We just need to wait
for the customers to show up.

00:11:03.457 --> 00:11:04.710
Can you stop telling me

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:05.830
about what Mr. Pei said?

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:07.213
If you can trust the boss's words,

00:11:07.213 --> 00:11:08.702
do you think this gym would close down?

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.590
We can obey his ideologies

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:18.270
but there needs to be someone
who can let him instill his ideologies.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.710
We should go give out flyers.

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:21.540
But Mr. Pei said

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:22.830
we must obey him

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:24.540
and not find any work to do.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:25.950
Then...

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.620
We must keep these sloths

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:29.590
in check, right?

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:30.710
I asked Mr. Pei about it

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:33.430
but he said just let them do anything
that they are comfortable with.

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:35.500
How could Mr. Pei
say something like that?

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.710
If the customers come here

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:37.660
and see the coaches

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.590
idling around,
do you think that's appropriate?

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:41.140
Mr. Pei.

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:44.500
Mr. Pei.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.780
What did you say just now?

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:47.830
She said

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:49.830
we should keep these sloths in check.

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:53.070

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:18.660
How brave.

00:12:19.124 --> 00:12:20.740
Someone actually took over this shop.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:23.500
You are...

I'm the boss of

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:30.070
you must do your best

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:32.070
to defeat us, Sloth Gym.

00:12:34.711 --> 00:12:35.620
I'll help you out.

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:03.500

can now be increased.

Come in.

Sibo,

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:17.310
why do you look so serious?

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:18.500
Mr. Pei,

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.830
regarding Zhongdian Web Fiction...

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.070
I know all about it.

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:23.830
When something new comes out,

00:13:23.835 --> 00:13:26.146
everyone should go through
the process of accepting it.

00:13:26.146 --> 00:13:27.140
Don't worry. I'm sure

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:28.380
it'll get better.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:29.430
Yes.

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:32.070
Mr. Pei, I want to discuss

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:34.710
the current situation
of Zhongdian Web Fiction.

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:36.780
We wanted

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:37.990
to invite a scholarly celebrity

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:39.110
to endorse it

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.190
but their charges are too expensive.

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:41.990
Sibo,

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:43.830
Zhongdian Web Fiction

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:45.500
is already doing well enough.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.470
Why do you want
to hire a celebrity to endorse...

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:55.310
Their charges are high?

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:56.724
Yes. They bring popularity

00:13:56.724 --> 00:13:58.110
but their charges are high,

00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:59.830
so the cost-performance ratio is low.

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:00.500
Mr. Pei,

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:01.780
can we consider

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:03.500
getting some popular webnovel authors?

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.102
Although they don't bring in
as much popularity as celebrities,

00:14:06.146 --> 00:14:08.020
they can improve
our content and reputation.

00:14:08.213 --> 00:14:08.710
Therefore...

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:09.310
Wrong!

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:11.310
Your focus is wrong.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.950
What is the main thing

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:14.350
about Zhongdian Web Fiction?

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.350
We need to bring in more popularity.

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:17.813
Content and reputation are things

00:14:17.835 --> 00:14:19.780
that we should be working on
in the next phase.

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:23.190
There's no cap on the budget.

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:24.990
Find me someone
with a lot of popularity.

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:28.110
All right.

has been on the rise.

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:53.380
Your team is very professional as well.

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:54.990
Thank you.

Thank you for your trust.

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:12.540
I think you've seen

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:14.620
200% of Mr. Pei's sincerity

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.710
in this collaboration.

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:21.190
This is a small gift from Mr. Pei.

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:22.190
Thank you.

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:30.190
Mr. Huang,

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:31.500
to be honest,

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.350
Yao normally only does

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:34.740
endorsements for luxurious brands.

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:36.020
We don't usually

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.950
work with startup companies.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:40.110
However,

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:41.590
Yao's image

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:44.110
is indeed scholarly.

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:46.146
We are also trying to present him

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.191
as someone who is highly knowledgeable.

00:15:48.213 --> 00:15:50.710
That is why we are willing
to give your company an opportunity.

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:52.070
I see.

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:55.950
Mandy,

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:58.500
what books
does Mr. Lu like to read usually?

00:15:58.568 --> 00:16:00.500
We can arrange
some activities to promote books

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.830
according to his book list.

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:05.230
You can ask him yourself.

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:14.230
Mr. Lu.

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:22.430
If you have a book that you recommend,

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:23.830
we can promote it as well.

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:30.380
Mr. Lu, what kind of books

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.020
do you usually like to read?

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:35.990
He usually reads many books

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:37.590
so he doesn't remember them suddenly.

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:39.470
Yes.

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:42.540
That happens to me often.

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:45.070
It's almost time.

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:47.710
Mr. Huang,

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:49.620
if there aren't any problems,

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:50.990
let's proceed.

00:16:51.191 --> 00:16:53.430
We still have a Hollywood project
to discuss later.

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:54.260
We have to leave.

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:55.310
Sure.

00:16:55.391 --> 00:16:56.835
Let's have a wonderful cooperation.

00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:57.710
Thank you.

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:02.350
Be careful.

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:09.540
Your gift!

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:43.950
It feels amazing
to return to the modern era.

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.950
I'm back!

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.020
- Bao, welcome back!
- Welcome back!

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.470
Thank you!

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:58.710
Enjoy.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:17:59.710
Thank you.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:03.300
Bao, you are finally back. Take it slow.

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:04.230
You don't know

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:06.190
how much I craved this bite out there.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:07.430
How pitiful.

00:18:07.635 --> 00:18:09.613
Traveling for a few days
is a form of recreation,

00:18:09.635 --> 00:18:11.020
but I might not be able to take it

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.591
if I'm out traveling
for months and years.

00:18:12.635 --> 00:18:13.260
Indeed.

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:16.300
Bao, you are getting fit now.

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:18.710
You can become a trainer at Sloth Gym.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:20.150
Sloth Gym?

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.990
What is Sloth Gym?

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:23.260
Sloth Gym

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.540
is a new gym that Mr. Pei invested in.

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:27.780
What?

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.300
Gosh.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.230
I think I've lost track of society.

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:33.470
Do you know?

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:35.546
Mr. Pei wanted me
to go to every tourist attraction

00:18:35.568 --> 00:18:36.950
and interact with the locals.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:38.390
He also wanted me to capture videos.

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:39.346
There wasn't a day

00:18:39.346 --> 00:18:41.302
when I could stay
at the hotel without stress.

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:42.870
The signal abroad was also bad.

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:44.710
I felt like
I've lost contact with all of you.

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:46.740
Tell me. What else
happened in the company

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:47.870
that I don't know about?

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:50.435
The test version of Returning to Shore
will soon be released.

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:53.230
So soon?

00:18:53.368 --> 00:18:55.835
Rest for two days
and come to the office to test it out.

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:57.670
Sure.

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:03.870
Bao, take it slow. Don't choke.

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:10.900
(Shenhua International)

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:14.260
(Return to Shore)
Testing of Return to Shore begins now.

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:15.910
The game has two modes.

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:18.539
The first mode is Free Poem Recital mode

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:20.150
and the other mode is Poem Battle mode.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:21.950
Bao, using an external controller

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:23.390
elevates the gaming experience.

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:24.150
Use my account.

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:24.870
Sure.

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:26.390
I can't wait.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:46.060
(Loading)

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:46.780
Bao,

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:47.630
are you sure

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:49.500
you don't need me
to give you a demonstration?

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.260
According to Mr. Pei's request,

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.230
the difficulty of this game
has been increased.

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:54.710
Don't worry.

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:57.100
I've played every type
of difficult games.

00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:58.230
Bao,

00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:59.780
I made my character well, right?

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.150
Does it look exactly like me?

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:03.020
Not bad.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.150
Bao,

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.020
I've completed the tutorial.

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:11.780
You can begin the battle right away.

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:13.857
(Continue)
Just play as you wish.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.300
No game is too tough for me.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:22.150
So cool.

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:22.910
Yes.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:23.360
Not bad.

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:49.870
Bao,

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:50.470
attack.

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:51.230
Do your best!

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:51.990
Do your best, Bao!

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:07.710
Bao, it's time. Use the ultimate attack.

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:08.746
Use the ultimate attack.

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:10.710
I can't.

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:12.500
- Use the ultimate attack, Bao!
- Bao!

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:13.150
The ultimate attack.

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:14.250
The ultimate attack, Bao!

00:21:14.257 --> 00:21:14.910
I can't.

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:15.300
Bao!

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:16.390
Now! Quick!

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:19.260
(Dead)
Game Over.

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:23.230
What's going on?

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:27.390
Mr. Pei requests
voice control in the game.

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:29.230
In Free Poem Recital mode,

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:30.857
when you use an ultimate attack,

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.780
you need to recite a poem you know

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:35.580
and state its dynasty and author

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.020
before you can use the attack.

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:39.670
I was careless.

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:40.630
Again.

00:21:40.946 --> 00:21:41.870
Bao, do your best.

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:42.300
Go!

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.230
Bao, do your best!

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:43.740
Go!

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:00.630
The goose

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:03.230
sings towards the sky.

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:05.430
Its white feathers
float above azure waters.

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:08.500
- Its red feet swim under the surface.
- Its red feet swim under the surface.

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:11.990
(Dead)
Game Over.

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:13.990
What's wrong?

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:15.390
Didn't I recite the poem?

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:17.020
You're an adult

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.100
and that's the only poem you know?

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:21.910
Even your three-year-old nephew
is better than this.

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:27.100
This is

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.580
the taunting system
requested by Mr. Pei.

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:31.710
In Free Poem Recital mode,

00:22:32.389 --> 00:22:34.820
Mr. Pei said simple poems
that we learned as children,

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:36.870
such as "Ode to the Goose"

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:38.990
and "The Peasants"

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:40.990
cannot be used.

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:42.546
They won't activate the ultimate attack.

00:22:42.546 --> 00:22:43.230
Mr. Pei...

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:47.150
I didn't realize
how much he loves Chinese culture.

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:48.580
But...

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:49.540
I've almost

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.470
forgotten everything
I learned in school.

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:52.430
It'll be too late

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:53.470
if I search while playing.

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:54.990
It's fine, Bao.

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:56.710
We'll work together.

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:58.470
Anyone who remembers a poem
will recite it.

00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:00.230
- All right!
- Okay!

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:04.100
Come on.

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:12.260
Again.

00:23:28.102 --> 00:23:29.470
Li Bai from the Tang Dynasty.

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:31.230
Cutting the water but it still flows.

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:35.430
Hurry.

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:36.500
Next sentence.

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:37.710
Continue.

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:39.430
What's next?

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:43.670
(Dead)
Game Over.

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:45.300
Are you stuck?

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.670
That's how you memorize poems?

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:47.950
How did you graduate?

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:50.910
You should go back
to the first year of primary school.

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:53.710
I'm not familiar with it.

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:55.230
Can't I do it slowly?

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:56.950
Mr. Pei requested this.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:58.540
You must recite it in time.

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:00.870
It must be difficult enough

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:02.740
for it to be a souls-like genre.

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:07.020
Again!

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:15.500
Shao You of the Qin Dynasty.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.470
A true meeting is worth more

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:19.780
than countless ordinary encounters.

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:22.990
(Dead)
Game Over.

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:25.230
Shaoyou has the surname Qin.

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:26.950
His full name is Qin Shaoyou.

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:28.524
A poet from the Northern Song Dynasty.

00:24:28.546 --> 00:24:31.060
Qin Shaoyou isn't a Qin Dynasty poet
called Shao You.

00:24:31.591 --> 00:24:32.990
Confucius from
the Spring and Autumn Period.

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:35.702
As Heaven is ceaseless in its motion,
the noble person never stops striving.

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:38.990
(Dead)
Game Over.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:40.230
This is from Zhou Yi.

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:42.020
It's not an ancient poem.

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:45.300
Modern, Vincent Fang.

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.635
Your hair is as white as snow.
Your departure is pitiful.

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:51.230
Hey, those are lyrics.

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:52.230
Not a poem.

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:53.300
Amazing.

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.230
Your knowledge

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.300
actually silenced the system.

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:00.990
(Dead)
Game Over.

00:25:03.302 --> 00:25:04.230
I'm not playing anymore.

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:05.710
I'm going to travel.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.430
I love traveling!

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:30.230
Du Fu from the Tang Dynasty.

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:33.230
Turning to see my wife,
I find her worries gone;

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:38.060
I roll up my books in wild joy,
almost mad with delight.

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:56.430
Great!

00:26:06.013 --> 00:26:07.990
Zhou Bangyan
from the Northern Song Dynasty.

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:10.480
Within the painted scene,
I recognize that face I once knew.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:16.780
Cao Pi from the Three Kingdoms.

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.360
When sorrow comes,
I think of you and dare not forget;

00:26:18.368 --> 00:26:20.302
Before I know it,
tears fall, soaking my robe.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.480
Aisin Gioro Hongli
from the Qing Dynasty.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.950
Gathering and sifting
through the Siku archives,

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:29.150
selecting from them
what's fair and worthy to pass on.

00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:30.710
Each man expresses loyal intent,
worthy of being recorded.

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:32.430
Though words may be taboo,
we endure and preserve them.

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:33.990
Better to be critical
than to blindly praise.

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:35.560
It's no shame to not be those
who praise without substance.

00:26:35.568 --> 00:26:37.500
Those who offend people
with honest words loyally

00:26:37.502 --> 00:26:39.324
deserve admiration and pity.

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:48.660
(Victory)

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:55.430
Huang, you're knowledgeable!

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:56.230
Huang!

00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.990
Mr. Huang!

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.670
I need to address you respectfully.

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.780
Why don't you release a strategy pack?

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:02.910
Use 100 poems

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:05.150
that everyone must memorize as a guide.

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:07.280
Otherwise, no one will be able
to complete the game.

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:08.630
Mr. Pei was the one

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:09.910
who came up with this game.

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:11.150
Mr. Pei is talented.

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:12.950
I dare not do this.

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:14.020
Let Mr. Pei play it.

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:15.190
I'm sure he'll do well.

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:16.390
Sure.

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:19.670
I win!

00:27:27.813 --> 00:27:29.740
If you enter here,
you can start to recite poems.

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:31.835
After reciting the poem,
you can use the ultimate attack.

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:37.635
A gentleman never...

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:39.780
(Dead)
Game Over.

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.300
Free Poem Recital mode?

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:44.260
For you, it's a Free Dying mode instead.

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:48.540
It is difficult indeed.

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:52.670
Let me choose an easier mode for you.

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:53.710
When you attack,

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:55.580
the screen will show you
half of the poem.

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.746
You need to recite the second half
within three seconds.

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:00.020
Then, you can attack.

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:05.020
(A gentleman never...)

00:28:05.457 --> 00:28:06.257
A gentleman...

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:07.470
Game Over.

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:10.020
I told you you'd die.

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.870
Just quit the game now.

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:20.020
This is even more difficult
than I imagined.

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:23.540
Did I misunderstand you?

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:26.540
The difficulty of every game now
is slightly greater.

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:27.780
Later, I'll ask Lv

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:29.235
to decrease the game's difficulty.

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:30.020
No need.

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:31.780
Just use this difficulty.

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:33.540
Keep increasing the boss's power.

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:35.950
I never expected

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:38.390
you guys to fulfill all my requests

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:40.710
and develop

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:41.630
such a game.

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:46.380
(The osprey calls)

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:47.230
Huang!

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:48.780
Save me, Huang!

00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:50.020
You don't know this?

00:28:50.168 --> 00:28:50.870
The osprey calls;

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:51.780
On the river islet.

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:53.780
Huang.

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:55.820
Drinking makes the sorrows worse.

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:57.213
What did you two learn in school?

00:28:57.213 --> 00:28:58.500
Huang! Help!

00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:00.430
Attack it. Attack it.

00:29:01.368 --> 00:29:03.480
(Please choose your stage)
This is a little tough.

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:05.580
If I do not come,
will you still not appear?

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:06.340
Huang.

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:07.060
Yes.

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:08.990
Help me recite this.

00:29:09.791 --> 00:29:11.835
All I see is the Yangtze River
flowing to the horizon.

00:29:11.857 --> 00:29:13.260
Huang!

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:16.660
♪Rising one by one♪

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:18.820
It's a smooth sailing journey.

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:20.260
Huang, over here!

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:22.540
Help us out.

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:23.540
Coming!

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:25.060
Huang, over here!

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:26.260
Sure. Ladies first.

00:29:27.405 --> 00:29:29.322
In June, West Lake's view

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:30.990
is like no other time.

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:31.950
Its view...

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:34.260
Lotus leaves stretch to the horizon,

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:37.470
flowers blush in the sun's prime.

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:49.020
In June, West Lake's view

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:51.390
is like no other time.

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:53.710
Lotus leaves stretch to the horizon,

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:56.190
flowers blush in the sun's prime.

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:01.910
Lotus leaves stretch to the horizon,

00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:03.390
flowers blush in the sun's prime.

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:05.870
West Lake's view is like no other time.

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:08.150
Bamboo staff and straw shoes
are lighter than a horse.

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:10.524
In my raincoat,
I roam through mist and drizzle at ease.

00:30:10.546 --> 00:30:11.910
I rarely speak in my life.

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:13.910
But when I do,
a single word moves thousands.

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:18.020
Jewels of beauties and seals of kings...

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:21.630
Jewels of beauties and seals of kings...

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:24.190
They all come
from beneath the waves and sand.

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:25.540
You don't even know this?

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:30.150
They all come
from beneath the waves and sand.

00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:36.470
My men have investigated this.

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:38.670
Everyone in Tengda

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:40.020
has been

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:42.710
memorizing poems recently.

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:44.390
Memorizing poems?

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:47.190
What is the purpose

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:49.260
of memorizing these poems?

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:52.780
Pei Qian has been doing things
with an unorthodox method.

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:54.150
So, there must be

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:56.470
an unknown

00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:57.910
and ruthless reason for doing this.

00:30:58.150 --> 00:30:58.950
I heard

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:01.190
his private kitchen
was not doing well,

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:03.710
so he started a web novel website

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:05.340
called Zhongdian Web Fiction.

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:07.340
Zhongdian Web Fiction?

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:10.390
It doesn't sound auspicious.

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:13.100
Is doing web fiction

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:14.613
something that costs a lot of money?

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:15.950
Pei Qian is probably

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:17.835
trying to venture
into the literature industry

00:31:17.924 --> 00:31:19.150
or even more.

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:20.630
For example,

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:22.230
doing IP rights

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:24.035
through literature

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.020
before going
into the entertainment business.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.710
I know Pei Qian very well.

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:30.260
He is ambitious.

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:31.950
He will not stop easily

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:34.060
in any industry!

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:41.630
Do you think

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:44.740
Pei Qian is indeed a far-sighted man?

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:46.190
However,

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.950
people fail to see the
cloud-piercing tree when it is young,

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:52.150
waiting until it towers high
before calling it great.

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:54.870
Perhaps

00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:58.260
he has been waiting for someone

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:01.150
who really knows

00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:03.190
and understands him.

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:05.670
As the saying goes,

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:10.780
a shared cup of wine makes us friends.

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:15.260
There's no need for two people
to know each other for a long time.

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:22.710
Pei Qian!

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:24.870
I see you!

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:27.190
Do you see me?

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:43.500
I'm not tired of working overtime.

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:44.910
It's normal to work overtime.

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:46.150
It's nothing.

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:47.870
The new game I'm working on

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:48.950
will be launched soon.

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:49.990
This is important.

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:51.630
I really don't want to go back.

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:53.670
Mom.

00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:55.100
I still have things to do.

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:56.390
I'm hanging up.

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:01.820
Sorry, Mr. Pei.

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:03.540
Did you hear everything?

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.190
Here. Have a candy.

00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:07.340
It improves your mood.

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:10.910
I actually feel like drinking alcohol.

00:33:17.457 --> 00:33:18.470
Just make do with this.

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:19.470
Alcoholic chocolate.

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:20.390
Next time,

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:22.260
I'll place some nice alcohol here.

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:24.950
Why are you here?

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:27.470
Didn't Mr. Qiao test the new game?

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:28.710
He raised a few issues,

00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:30.020
so I figured I'd come

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:32.150
and make some changes.

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:35.710
You are a good boss.

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:36.340
No.

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:38.710
I'm not a good boss.

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:39.500
Look.

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.150
I hired you

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:42.910
and I gave all this work to you.

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:44.710
Because of my tyranny,

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:46.746
you have no choice
but to work overtime in secret.

00:33:46.746 --> 00:33:48.680
Actually,
your parents' concern is reasonable.

00:33:48.746 --> 00:33:49.630
Shenhua is good.

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:50.630
If you go back,

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:52.630
you'll surely do better
than in Tengda Games.

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:54.680
Moreover, your parents' business
is going very well.

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.390
They know a lot better than you and me.

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:58.100
You should discuss it with them.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:00.390
That's how you solve a problem.

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:01.870
You must listen to them.

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:03.020
Understand?

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:08.350
I think I get it.

00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:10.524
My parents are definitely
more knowledgeable than I am.

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:13.430
I will tell them my opinion.

00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:14.660
They might understand me.

00:34:16.910 --> 00:34:17.750
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

00:34:17.768 --> 00:34:19.270
I won't be working overtime today, then.

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:20.020
You don't need to.

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:20.830
I'll go back

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:22.620
and talk to my parents

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.580
about why I'm staying in Tengda.

00:34:26.910 --> 00:34:27.910
Bye.

00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:49.540
Mr. Pei,

00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:51.540
did your employee misunderstand you?

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:52.580
Previously, I said

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:54.429
there were only
a few pieces of good equipment,

00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:55.350
so they should improve

00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:57.310
the ones that are weaker.

00:34:57.310 --> 00:34:58.430
Now,

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:01.100
they even nerfed the good ones.

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:02.140
Yes.

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:02.950
Look.

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.350
If I nerf the good weapons,

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:06.620
doesn't it mean

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:08.830
the others have been improved?

00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:10.310
It matches the theory of relativity.

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:12.660
You...

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:14.020
Is that how you understand it?

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:16.830
I also suggested

00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:18.620
you decrease the boss's difficulty.

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:20.060
Not only did you not decrease it,

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:21.502
but you even increased the difficulty

00:35:21.502 --> 00:35:22.270
of the later bosses.

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:24.620
When I increase the difficulty
of the bosses later,

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:26.970
doesn't it mean the bosses in front
are now easier to defeat?

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:28.500
I...

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:32.990
Fine.

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.870
I even asked you to consider

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:38.140
the harshness of how you taunt gamers.

00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:39.270
Right now...

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:40.620
I did.

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:42.540
Look. I added many puns

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:43.870
in the voice system.

00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:46.270
Gamers have to think about it
after they hear it.

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:47.350
There's a buffer now,

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:49.140
so it won't be as harsh.

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:54.020
Sure.

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:55.790
There's no problem now.

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:57.220
I won't bother you.

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:05.700
Is this how

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:07.310
they are playing games nowadays?

00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:09.870
You'll suffer more
in the future, Mr. Qiao.

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:11.950
I'll continue

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:13.870
with the rest after this.

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:19.430
Mr. Pei,

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:22.620
not many people
are visiting the Shared Phone Booth.

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:24.870
Business at Sloth Gym
also doesn't look good.

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:26.790
Why don't we cut our losses

00:36:26.957 --> 00:36:28.757
and invest in projects
that can make money?

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:29.950
Mr. Pei,

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:31.500
we spent a lot

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:32.991
on Lu Zhiyao's endorsement fees.

00:36:32.991 --> 00:36:35.660
However, it didn't bring much
to the website.

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:37.470
His fans

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:39.830
only care about liking
and commenting on his selfies.

00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:42.790
Not many people
actually visit the website.

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:44.790
I'm already reflecting on myself deeply.

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:45.540
This time,

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:47.790
I might have disappointed you.

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:48.750
Mr. Pei,

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.180
according to our plan,

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:52.568
Return to Shore will be
launched at the end of this month.

00:36:52.591 --> 00:36:54.100
Marketing gave a few proposals,

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:56.060
but Lv and I think it's not suitable.

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.140
I won't be going through.

00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:58.350
Just make your own decision.

00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:00.140
If you think we are lacking
in marketing budget,

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:01.020
I can provide more.

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:03.213
We must make sure
that the game is launched on time.

00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:05.270
Sibo.

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:07.870
You didn't disappoint me.

00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:09.540
This money spent was

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:11.350
worth it.

00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:13.220
Did you forget

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:15.390
the ideology of Dreamforge Capital?

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:17.257
Profit is not important.

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.500
The most important thing is...

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:21.220
To have dreams.

00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:22.270
Yes.

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:24.140
I think my wings have been clipped.

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:26.100
Ma,

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:28.700
the journey to one's dream

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:30.470
won't be successful immediately.

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:32.310
Be persistent on the journey.

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:34.310
Time tests people

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:37.430
as distance tests a horse.

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:42.270
Mr. Pei, you seem like
you're in a good mood.

00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:43.870
No.

00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:44.870
I've been

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:46.620
very anxious recently.

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:47.270
Look.

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:49.270
Zhongdian Web Fiction,

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:50.390

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:51.390
and Return to Shore

00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:53.310
will all be launched soon.

00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:55.270
Tengda is now blooming on all ends.

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:57.310
If you are persistent,

00:37:57.310 --> 00:37:59.660
you will see
that all your dreams have bloomed.

00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:04.180
All your dreams have bloomed.

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:07.220
Your pitch was off.

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:21.750
Hello, everyone.

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:22.540
Welcome to

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:24.540
"What Happens in the Gaming Industry?"

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:25.580
This morning at ten,

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:26.350
Tengda Games

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:28.220
launched a new game, Return to Shore.

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:30.950
(Return to Shore)
It received lots of feedback quickly.

00:38:31.235 --> 00:38:32.180
What is this stupid game?

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:33.270
Is Tengda joking?

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:34.020
Lousy game.

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:35.540
What kind of crazy game is this?

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.700
I can't use the ultimate attack at all.

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.768
Why must I recite a poem
while playing a game?

00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:41.099
(Souls-like games are hard enough)

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:42.740
(and you're asking me
to recite poems?)

00:38:42.746 --> 00:38:44.350
(Am I playing a game
or going to an exam?)

00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:45.870
(This is torturing the gamers.)

00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:48.430
(Those who have yet
to play this game, beware.)

00:38:50.035 --> 00:38:52.790
(It's difficult just for the sake of it.
There's no playability at all.)

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:54.390
(Everyone, turn back while you can.)

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:58.310
(The system kept taunting the gamers.)

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:01.140
(You should be
worshiping your customers.)

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:02.910
(Is it fun laughing at us?)

00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:04.750
You are right.

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:06.500
You get me.

00:39:11.746 --> 00:39:12.302
Come in.

00:39:12.324 --> 00:39:12.870
Mr. Pei.

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:13.990
There's an emergency situation.

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:15.924
Many people are
scolding Tengda on the Internet.

00:39:16.013 --> 00:39:17.100
Calm down.

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:18.700
I see everything.

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:20.140
The negative feedback

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:21.750
is posted between

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:23.790
It's obvious

00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:25.220
that someone is trying to bash us.

00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:26.350
Do we have proof?

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:28.100
Perhaps these are all

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:29.950
real feedback from gamers.

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:34.830
Some of the feedback is true,

00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:36.390
but we have indeed been attacked.

00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:37.270
I investigated it.

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:39.350
It's the company
that worked with Sky Fire.

00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:40.500
Yes.

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:41.990
It must be Zhou Muyan.

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:43.435
I'm sure he was the one attacking us.

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:45.500
We are innocent.

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:46.870
When facing haters,

00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:48.700
time will prove everything.

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:50.620
If we try to argue and fight back,

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:52.350
we will be no different from them.

00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:55.700
This is against Tengda's values.

00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:04.500
(What even is Return to Shore?)

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.150
(I won't even play it even if it's free.)

00:40:07.057 --> 00:40:08.910
(Sky Fire is the best
at developing games.)

00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:10.746
(I'll only play games
developed by Sky Fire.)

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.790
(Tengda Games is bad.)

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:15.435
(I'll only play games from Sky Fire.)

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:18.390
Marketing timed it well.

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:19.660
Return to Shore

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:21.750
will never become famous.

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:27.700
Well done.

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:31.220
Go and celebrate tonight.

00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:34.390
Mr. Zhou,

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:35.950
Return to Shore

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:37.580
is full of bad feedback on the Internet.

00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:39.020
We have

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:40.500
achieved some progress in stages.

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:43.750
It's Friday.

00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:46.540
Everyone has been on standby this month.

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:48.060
Give them

00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:50.220
this weekend off.

00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:13.430
Shared Phone Booth and
Sloth Gym are losing money.

00:41:13.435 --> 00:41:15.350
Zhongdian Web Fiction
is also losing money.

00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:17.470
Return to Shore
has a high production cost.

00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:20.060
It has made a huge loss indeed.

00:41:20.257 --> 00:41:22.013
The project was launched.

00:41:22.013 --> 00:41:23.830
Calculation will be
at the end of the month.

00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:25.430
Barring any surprises, Mr. Pei,

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:27.750
you will soon
realize a high profit for yourself.

00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:28.950
Xin,

00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:30.220
you've worked hard.

00:41:32.613 --> 00:41:33.857
Reduce the cost for me.

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.791
It's fine. I can pay this myself.

00:41:35.791 --> 00:41:38.350
I won't be claiming all these expenses.

00:41:40.830 --> 00:41:42.020
Everyone, you've worked hard.

00:41:43.168 --> 00:41:44.968
Today is a good day.

00:41:45.013 --> 00:41:46.950
We'll have a gathering during lunch

00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:49.168
and all of you can go home
for the rest of the day.

I'm very satisfied.

Wait.

What results have we achieved?

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:43.660
I don't know.

00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:45.470
Looking at him,

00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:47.540
they might think we are
having a celebratory feast.

to criticize us?

Is Mr. Pei

using the victory mindset method

00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:01.910
to encourage us?

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:03.470
I'm confused.

00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:06.430
Did we really get paid?

Hao Qiong,

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:10.020
did we really make money?

Hao Qiong, why are you laughing?

00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:13.220
Did we really make money?

00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:15.470
Can you eat?

00:43:16.124 --> 00:43:17.390
I don't have an appetite.

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:27.700
Why aren't you eating?

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:29.390
Are you not hungry?

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:33.660
I advise all of you

00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:35.470

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:41.835
Eat a grain of the company's rice

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.140
and the company will return you
a pot of rice tomorrow.

00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:46.910
Look.

00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:48.700
Hao Qiong eats well.

00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:50.140
We are lacking some main dishes.

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:52.310
I like to eat with rice.

00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:57.660
Hao Qiong, look at this.

00:43:57.660 --> 00:43:58.990
They are round and shiny.

00:43:58.990 --> 00:44:00.100
Make do with this

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:01.700
and think of it as rice.

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:02.540
Get a few spoonfuls.

Chef Lin,

00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:08.540
make a few dishes for them,

00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:09.830
so they have something to eat.

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:13.950

Yes.

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:49.990
What's going on?

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:55.390
I think it's here.

00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:56.950
I think this should be the place.

00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:57.950
