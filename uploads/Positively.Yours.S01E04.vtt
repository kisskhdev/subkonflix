Alright.

00:19:49.238 --> 00:19:50.905
Today's lunch is

00:19:50.905 --> 00:19:53.005
a special event prepared by

00:19:53.005 --> 00:19:55.438
the President and Chef Jung Ji Sun

00:19:55.438 --> 00:19:57.972
for our hardworking staff.

00:19:57.972 --> 00:20:01.772
We hope you enjoy it!

00:20:05.805 --> 00:20:07.072
What's the occasion today?

00:20:07.072 --> 00:20:09.738
Chef Jung Ji Sun is at our cafeteria?

00:20:09.738 --> 00:20:11.805
Our president is generous!

00:20:11.805 --> 00:20:14.505
Sugar-glazed sweet potatoes,
stir-fried seafood and vegetables,

00:20:14.505 --> 00:20:16.938
lobster jjampong, even dim sum!

00:20:18.738 --> 00:20:20.538
You said earlier you wanted jjampong.

00:20:20.538 --> 00:20:22.072
The menu is exactly Chinese food.

00:20:22.072 --> 00:20:23.805
Right.

00:20:30.838 --> 00:20:34.905
For our intern, an extra lobster! Thank you.

00:20:34.905 --> 00:20:36.738
Thank you.

00:20:39.305 --> 00:20:43.138
And for Manager Jang,
specially, an extra lobster.

00:20:44.672 --> 00:20:46.772
Oh, I'm sorry... I can't eat it.

00:20:46.772 --> 00:20:48.472
Manager Jang?

00:20:48.472 --> 00:20:52.072
Oh, my! Two whole lobsters
per person? Such luxury!

00:20:52.072 --> 00:20:54.838
There aren't many left, so I think
we have to stop giving them out. Sorry.

00:20:54.838 --> 00:20:56.538
Yes.

00:21:08.905 --> 00:21:10.672
Are you really that worried about her?

00:21:10.672 --> 00:21:15.105
She's suffering from morning sickness.
I can't just pretend not to notice.

00:21:15.105 --> 00:21:18.605
This is just consideration and goodwill.

00:21:18.605 --> 00:21:20.372
Oh, yeah?

00:21:20.372 --> 00:21:23.672
So is that the end of your goodwill?

00:21:23.672 --> 00:21:25.338
I don't know. What am I supposed to do?

00:21:25.338 --> 00:21:29.605
With this kind of thing, details
matter more than grand gestures.

00:21:29.605 --> 00:21:31.238
No wonder you're a chaebol heir.

00:21:31.238 --> 00:21:33.472
It needs sincerity.

00:21:33.472 --> 00:21:35.372
Sincerity?

00:21:37.672 --> 00:21:38.705
Jujube tea.

00:21:38.705 --> 00:21:40.338
Wow, retro vibes.

00:21:40.338 --> 00:21:43.338
Is this the welcome drink for Hanok Village?

00:21:43.338 --> 00:21:45.705
When I was little, whenever
I had a cold or an upset stomach,

00:21:45.705 --> 00:21:48.205
my mom would make me
lots of jujube tea syrup drinks.

00:21:48.205 --> 00:21:52.372
I looked it up, and they say it's good for
morning sickness and boosting immunity.

00:21:52.372 --> 00:21:55.005
Yeah, that's so thoughtful.
This is exactly what I mean by details.

00:21:55.005 --> 00:21:58.705
That's quite a lot, good luck.

00:21:58.705 --> 00:22:00.305
Where are you going?
You have to do this with me.

00:22:00.305 --> 00:22:02.605
I'm allergic to jujubes, seriously.

00:22:02.605 --> 00:22:05.272
Allergic to jujubes? You're joking, right?

00:22:05.272 --> 00:22:07.372
Want me to give you another allergy too?

00:22:07.372 --> 00:22:09.938
Where should we start?

00:22:09.938 --> 00:22:11.205
Shake it off, this first.

00:22:11.205 --> 00:22:13.005
Looks like this is going to be a busy one.

00:22:14.138 --> 00:22:15.638
Manager Jang hasn't come back?

00:22:15.638 --> 00:22:16.805
Did she go to the hospital or something?

00:22:16.805 --> 00:22:18.772
What on earth did she eat
to get gastroenteritis?

00:22:18.772 --> 00:22:20.105
I heard she ate bad raw oysters.

00:22:20.105 --> 00:22:21.438
Norovirus?

00:22:21.438 --> 00:22:23.472
Wow, I hear that's no joke?

00:22:23.472 --> 00:22:25.405
If it's severe, you have to be hospitalized
and get an IV drip. It's that bad.

00:22:25.405 --> 00:22:27.472
Shouldn't we report the place
if it got her that sick?

00:22:27.472 --> 00:22:28.838
Making someone that sick!

00:22:28.838 --> 00:22:29.905
Should I just report them?

00:22:29.905 --> 00:22:31.705
Please just pretend you don't know anything.

00:22:31.705 --> 00:22:33.638
Did she really

00:22:33.638 --> 00:22:34.772
come down with norovirus?

00:22:34.772 --> 00:22:36.372
Then what could it be?

00:22:36.372 --> 00:22:37.905
Hangover!

00:22:37.905 --> 00:22:39.272
Ah, probably not that.

00:22:39.272 --> 00:22:42.305
Manager Jang has a perfectly healthy liver.

00:22:42.305 --> 00:22:45.572
Could there be some story she can't tell us?

00:22:45.572 --> 00:22:47.805
Oh, what could there possibly be?

00:22:47.805 --> 00:22:49.305
No, there might be something.

00:22:49.305 --> 00:22:51.405
Like with the Germany
study program last time,

00:22:51.405 --> 00:22:54.172
she's been very suspicious lately.

00:22:59.905 --> 00:23:02.272
So, for the urgent matters first,

00:23:02.272 --> 00:23:04.538
the analysis of the first-half of next year's
liquor market trends.

00:23:04.538 --> 00:23:06.405
You two divide the work

00:23:06.405 --> 00:23:07.705
and handle it properly.

00:23:07.705 --> 00:23:09.105
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:23:09.105 --> 00:23:11.138
Do you like Hui Won or something?

00:23:11.138 --> 00:23:14.938
What? I'm just worried
she might meet some weirdo.

00:23:14.938 --> 00:23:16.005
You two handle this.

00:23:16.005 --> 00:23:18.205
Yes.

00:23:18.205 --> 00:23:20.472
Assistant Manager Cha.

00:23:20.472 --> 00:23:22.538
Assistant Manager Cha.

00:23:22.538 --> 00:23:24.272
Yes?

00:23:24.272 --> 00:23:26.672
Oh.

00:23:26.672 --> 00:23:29.272
Yes, I understand.

00:23:29.272 --> 00:23:31.838
And besides managing existing clients,

00:23:31.838 --> 00:23:34.872
you all know we need to develop
new client relationships too, right?

00:23:34.872 --> 00:23:35.872
Yes.

00:23:35.872 --> 00:23:38.053
Shouldn't the sales team
get some applause too?

00:23:38.053 --> 00:23:39.973
Ah.

00:23:40.605 --> 00:23:42.805
Why do my eyes just
want to close after eating?

00:23:42.805 --> 00:23:45.605
I need to wake up a bit.

00:23:45.605 --> 00:23:46.638
Oh, Assistant Manager Cha!

00:23:46.638 --> 00:23:48.205
- Oh.
- It's been a while.

00:23:48.205 --> 00:23:49.538
Manager, how have you been?

00:23:49.538 --> 00:23:51.909
What brings you to our floor?

00:23:51.909 --> 00:23:53.669
Oh...

00:23:54.372 --> 00:23:56.105
Here to see Manager Jang?

00:23:56.105 --> 00:23:59.938
We're starting the trend analysis
for the first-half of next year soon.

00:23:59.938 --> 00:24:02.038
So I thought she might
have some helpful materials.

00:24:02.038 --> 00:24:03.872
Oh, Assistant Manager Cha, as expected.

00:24:03.872 --> 00:24:05.805
So that's why you are so close
with Manager Jang.

00:24:05.805 --> 00:24:08.438
Do aces just understand each other?

00:24:08.438 --> 00:24:11.172
If you keep buttering me up like that,
I might actually believe it.

00:24:11.172 --> 00:24:12.505
I'm just working hard.

00:24:12.505 --> 00:24:14.672
What? Humble too?

00:24:14.672 --> 00:24:17.305
I'm jealous of you, Assistant Manager Cha.

00:24:18.238 --> 00:24:19.772
By the way, is everything okay
with Manager Jang?

00:24:19.772 --> 00:24:22.005
She can't seem to focus and seems sick often.

00:24:22.005 --> 00:24:23.738
Is that so?

00:24:24.672 --> 00:24:28.205
I haven't heard anything.

00:24:28.205 --> 00:24:31.038
Hui Won works so hard, that's probably why.

00:24:31.038 --> 00:24:32.505
She's a workaholic, you know.

00:24:32.505 --> 00:24:34.872
Yeah? Well, if nothing's wrong, that's good.

00:24:34.872 --> 00:24:36.472
Ah, then I'll head down first.

00:24:36.472 --> 00:24:39.205
Yes, please go ahead.

00:24:55.938 --> 00:24:56.938
Are you okay?

00:24:56.938 --> 00:24:58.972
If you're going to scold me, do it later.

00:24:58.972 --> 00:25:00.905
I don't even have the energy
to get scolded today.

00:25:00.905 --> 00:25:02.905
Am I someone who scolds you every day?

00:25:02.905 --> 00:25:04.938
I'm worried.

00:25:05.905 --> 00:25:09.072
But this boyfriend of yours...

00:25:09.072 --> 00:25:11.272
Oh, sorry.

00:25:11.272 --> 00:25:13.005
Hey, here.

00:25:13.772 --> 00:25:15.838
If it's tough, want to go to the hospital?

00:25:15.838 --> 00:25:18.472
No, it's just the morning sickness.

00:25:18.472 --> 00:25:20.638
Let's go get a prescription for that.

00:25:20.638 --> 00:25:21.805
I'll go with you.

00:25:21.805 --> 00:25:25.438
If someone sees us, they might
misunderstand. I'll handle it myself.

00:25:30.805 --> 00:25:33.338
You said you could handle it,
but you seem off.

00:25:41.872 --> 00:25:43.505
Here.

00:25:43.505 --> 00:25:45.738
Hold on to it properly.

00:25:45.738 --> 00:25:47.672
Don't spill it.

00:25:49.405 --> 00:25:51.105
Oh.

00:25:52.138 --> 00:25:53.838
Thank you.

00:26:00.472 --> 00:26:01.938
Call me if it gets hard.

00:26:01.938 --> 00:26:03.538
Even at dawn.

00:26:03.538 --> 00:26:04.705
Got it.

00:26:04.705 --> 00:26:06.538
Go quickly.

00:26:09.172 --> 00:26:12.172
That male friend worked at our company?

00:26:13.305 --> 00:26:16.005
Oh my, I went all out washing the jujubes

00:26:16.005 --> 00:26:17.472
and now my whole body aches.

00:26:17.472 --> 00:26:21.305
You know I shed my blood, sweat,
and tears for that jujube syrup, right?

00:26:21.305 --> 00:26:24.705
Try putting some real effort into me
instead of everyone else.

00:26:24.705 --> 00:26:27.238
If I'm choosing, I want
grand gestures, not details.

00:26:27.238 --> 00:26:29.105
You know, something big. That kind of thing.

00:26:29.105 --> 00:26:30.972
Are you even listening?

00:26:32.538 --> 00:26:33.572
The report.

00:26:33.572 --> 00:26:34.872
The report?

00:26:34.872 --> 00:26:35.972
The report is really not good.

00:26:35.972 --> 00:26:37.138
I thought it was fine.

00:26:37.138 --> 00:26:38.305
No.

00:26:38.305 --> 00:26:41.772
From beginning to end,
there isn't a single part I like.

00:26:41.772 --> 00:26:43.705
- Get the person in charge to redo it...
- No.

00:26:43.705 --> 00:26:44.805
No need for that.

00:26:44.805 --> 00:26:48.572
I know someone who's
perfectly suited for this job.

00:26:51.305 --> 00:26:52.372
You wanted to see me?

00:26:52.372 --> 00:26:54.469
Assistant Manager Cha Min Uk?

00:26:54.469 --> 00:26:58.072
I heard you are famous in the sales team
for being diligent and meticulous.

00:26:58.072 --> 00:26:59.269
They say you're the king of organization.

00:26:59.269 --> 00:27:00.773
Oh.

00:27:01.872 --> 00:27:03.672
And?

00:27:03.672 --> 00:27:08.438
The reports from the sales team
sometimes feel rough, so I was curious.

00:27:08.438 --> 00:27:12.405
I wondered just how meticulous
your reports would be.

00:27:19.772 --> 00:27:21.472
Well,

00:27:21.472 --> 00:27:22.872
it can be done
by the end of this week, right?

00:27:22.872 --> 00:27:24.605
This week...

00:27:27.005 --> 00:27:29.072
All of these?

00:27:29.072 --> 00:27:30.772
Yes.

00:27:31.972 --> 00:27:34.805
Yes, I understand.

00:27:39.845 --> 00:27:41.405
Oh.

00:27:41.405 --> 00:27:46.661
I hope I'm not taking time away
from your date, Assistant Manager Cha.

00:27:46.661 --> 00:27:47.905
Oh.

00:27:47.905 --> 00:27:50.238
I don't have a girlfriend.

00:27:51.405 --> 00:27:52.738
Is that so?

00:27:52.738 --> 00:27:56.438
That's surprising. You're quite good-looking.

00:27:56.438 --> 00:27:58.172
Well then.

00:27:58.905 --> 00:28:00.972
And perhaps,

00:28:03.372 --> 00:28:05.472
is there someone you like?

00:28:05.472 --> 00:28:07.938
You don't have anyone you like either?

00:28:07.938 --> 00:28:09.638
Pardon?

00:28:17.572 --> 00:28:21.438
Is he complimenting me? Or picking a fight?

00:28:22.338 --> 00:28:24.105
He's a bit odd.

00:28:24.105 --> 00:28:26.038
Are you handling
all the company work by yourself?

00:28:26.038 --> 00:28:27.372
Wow.

00:28:27.372 --> 00:28:30.105
Work really should be done
like Assistant Manager Cha does it, right?

00:28:30.105 --> 00:28:33.138
Wow, nice, yeah.

00:28:35.205 --> 00:28:38.505
Ms. Ye Jin, Ms. Ye Jin!

00:28:41.605 --> 00:28:43.438
The weather's gloomy today.

00:28:43.438 --> 00:28:45.105
- Did everyone bring an umbrella?
- Is it supposed to rain today?

00:28:45.105 --> 00:28:46.538
I have one at the office.

00:28:46.538 --> 00:28:48.805
I'm fine. I plan to go
for a run after work today.

00:28:48.805 --> 00:28:50.538
What? They say it's going to rain heavily.

00:28:50.538 --> 00:28:53.138
Ah, haven't you heard
of the 'rain-run' trend these days?

00:28:53.138 --> 00:28:54.672
- You gotta run when you can run.
- Look at that.

00:28:54.672 --> 00:28:56.405
Tak Soo is so passionate.

00:28:56.405 --> 00:28:58.372
- What about Assistant Manager Choi?
- Of course I have one.

00:28:58.372 --> 00:29:01.472
If I don't bring it, who else is going to?

00:29:01.472 --> 00:29:03.505
On a rainy day like this,

00:29:03.505 --> 00:29:05.705
is there no man to get wet in the rain
with me instead of just using an umbrella?

00:29:05.705 --> 00:29:07.472
Nope, none. And you'll catch a cold.

00:29:07.472 --> 00:29:09.572
This isn't romance.
It's turning into a disaster movie.

00:29:09.572 --> 00:29:12.238
Manager, your way of thinking is really...

00:29:12.238 --> 00:29:13.238
Be honest.

00:29:13.238 --> 00:29:15.705
Your wife scolded you a lot
when you were dating, right?

00:29:15.705 --> 00:29:18.372
No, she was totally into me.

00:29:19.738 --> 00:29:22.072
Hey, Manager Jang! Do you have an umbrella?

00:29:22.072 --> 00:29:25.138
- Is it raining?
- They said it'll rain heavily tonight.

00:29:25.138 --> 00:29:26.705
Looks like I'll need to leave
on the dot today.

00:29:26.705 --> 00:29:28.938
I didn't even bring an umbrella.

00:29:30.838 --> 00:29:33.105
Is Manager Jang still feeling unwell
from the norovirus?

00:29:33.105 --> 00:29:35.305
Even so, her pale skin looks even paler.

00:29:35.305 --> 00:29:39.905
She used to pull three all-nighters,
but now she's leaving early.

00:29:39.905 --> 00:29:41.772
Are you having a meeting or just chatting?

00:29:41.772 --> 00:29:42.872
Team Leader, did you bring an umbrella?

00:29:42.872 --> 00:29:44.005
They said it's supposed
to rain heavily tonight.

00:29:44.005 --> 00:29:45.638
Why? Should I use yours, Manager Nah?

00:29:45.638 --> 00:29:47.205
I'm really sorry. I only have one myself.

00:29:47.205 --> 00:29:49.938
Unless you're going to hand over yours
or stop the rain yourself,

00:29:49.938 --> 00:29:55.605
stop worrying about the weather
and get back to work.

00:29:58.705 --> 00:29:59.972
Is there someone you like?

00:29:59.972 --> 00:30:02.505
You don't have anyone you like either?

00:30:02.505 --> 00:30:04.172
Childish. So childish.

00:30:04.172 --> 00:30:05.172
What, are you a kindergartener?

00:30:05.172 --> 00:30:07.605
No way, did you hear that?

00:30:07.605 --> 00:30:10.838
Instead of doing your work,
you were eavesdropping outside? Jeez.

00:30:10.838 --> 00:30:14.272
Since when did you summon
employees separately to assign work?

00:30:14.272 --> 00:30:16.805
Just because he's close with Manager Jang.

00:30:16.805 --> 00:30:19.405
What did Assistant Manager Cha do wrong?

00:30:19.405 --> 00:30:21.538
It seems like you've got
some misunderstanding.

00:30:21.538 --> 00:30:24.305
Core talents of the company
are always under special management.

00:30:24.305 --> 00:30:26.772
He's famous in the sales team
for being diligent and meticulous.

00:30:26.772 --> 00:30:29.405
And it's only natural for a president
to show interest in employees.

00:30:29.405 --> 00:30:30.405
Should I just ignore it?

00:30:30.405 --> 00:30:32.172
Oh, is that so?

00:30:32.172 --> 00:30:35.472
Then why don't you pay some attention to me,
who's stuck by your side all day, huh?

00:30:35.472 --> 00:30:37.338
My birthday's coming up.

00:30:37.338 --> 00:30:38.338
Oh, wait a second.

00:30:38.338 --> 00:30:39.972
This is a bit sensitive.

00:30:39.972 --> 00:30:42.872
You don't know my birthday, do you?

00:30:50.005 --> 00:30:53.572
Come on, how long have we known each other?

00:30:53.572 --> 00:30:55.472
October...

00:30:55.472 --> 00:30:56.772
21st, right?

00:30:56.772 --> 00:30:58.905
Wow.

00:30:58.905 --> 00:31:00.938
I suspected it, but still...

00:31:00.938 --> 00:31:02.305
It's the 25th.

00:31:02.305 --> 00:31:04.038
October 25th.

00:31:04.038 --> 00:31:05.838
This is annoying.

00:31:05.838 --> 00:31:08.305
You keep calling me Secretary Go.

00:31:08.305 --> 00:31:10.638
But you do remember my name, right?

00:31:11.438 --> 00:31:14.505
Why would you say something that hurtful?

00:31:14.505 --> 00:31:15.938
You're talking nonsense.

00:31:15.938 --> 00:31:17.605
You!

00:31:17.605 --> 00:31:20.005
You're acting unlike yourself, that's why.

00:31:20.005 --> 00:31:22.538
Ugh, I don't know what's so special about you

00:31:22.538 --> 00:31:24.305
that I have to drive you home
on a rainy day like this.

00:31:24.305 --> 00:31:25.538
It's raining outside now?

00:31:25.538 --> 00:31:27.572
It's been raining for a while.

00:31:30.238 --> 00:31:32.538
Why? Do you have business
with the New Product Development Team?

00:31:32.538 --> 00:31:35.605
Just checking if our company's
core departments and key talents

00:31:35.605 --> 00:31:37.438
are preparing to leave work properly.

00:31:37.438 --> 00:31:40.705
Wait, do you even care about
when I leave work?

00:31:40.705 --> 00:31:41.972
Hey, hold on.

00:31:41.972 --> 00:31:43.738
Don't tell me...

00:31:44.438 --> 00:31:46.272
You're worried Manager Jang
might not have an umbrella?

00:31:46.272 --> 00:31:48.238
You didn't care when I got completely soaked.

00:31:48.238 --> 00:31:49.838
Just check real quick and leave right away.

00:31:49.838 --> 00:31:51.338
I'll head home on my own.

00:31:51.338 --> 00:31:53.338
Ah, I can go?

00:31:53.338 --> 00:31:54.538
You should've said so earlier.

00:31:54.538 --> 00:31:56.938
I'm clocking out on time.

00:31:56.938 --> 00:31:58.005
Si Hyeong!

00:31:58.005 --> 00:31:59.605
Don't make it obvious.
Seriously, don't let it show.

00:31:59.605 --> 00:32:01.338
Alright.

00:32:26.405 --> 00:32:28.405
- Good work today.
- You worked hard.

00:32:28.405 --> 00:32:30.638
- Yes, see you tomorrow.
- Yes.

00:32:35.638 --> 00:32:36.972
That's right.

00:32:36.972 --> 00:32:40.238
Jang Hui Won wouldn't
have brought an umbrella.

00:32:52.172 --> 00:32:54.117
Thank you.

00:32:54.117 --> 00:32:56.165
Oh.

00:33:07.472 --> 00:33:10.638
Don't tell me you were
planning to walk in the rain?

00:33:10.638 --> 00:33:12.105
What could I do? I didn't have an umbrella.

00:33:12.105 --> 00:33:15.105
The chance of rain was over 70%.
Did you not check the weather?

00:33:15.105 --> 00:33:17.438
I've been too busy to check.

00:33:17.438 --> 00:33:19.505
Unlike some people,
every day's a battle for me.

00:33:19.505 --> 00:33:21.838
What if you, a pregnant woman, catch a cold?

00:33:21.838 --> 00:33:23.172
Ugh, enough with the nagging.

00:33:23.172 --> 00:33:27.338
What kind of president chases an employee
after work just to nag them?

00:33:27.338 --> 00:33:28.605
So why did you come?

00:33:28.605 --> 00:33:31.705
Do you need something from me?

00:33:42.705 --> 00:33:46.605
It's not leftovers, and it's not
from someone else. Take it.

00:33:47.572 --> 00:33:49.872
You drove me just to give me this?

00:33:49.872 --> 00:33:52.305
'Just'? Just?

00:33:52.305 --> 00:33:54.638
Do you even know what kind of
handmade syrup this is?

00:33:54.638 --> 00:33:56.072
How would I know that?

00:33:56.072 --> 00:33:57.505
Well, this syrup...

00:33:57.505 --> 00:34:00.805
I personally made it,
paying attention to every single step.

00:34:00.805 --> 00:34:02.838
Have you ever made jujube syrup?

00:34:02.838 --> 00:34:05.338
You have to scrub it clean with baking soda,

00:34:05.338 --> 00:34:07.938
remove the stems and seeds,
and carefully prepare each piece of fruit.

00:34:07.938 --> 00:34:09.472
It takes a lot of care to grind it finely

00:34:09.472 --> 00:34:11.472
and simmer it over low heat.

00:34:11.472 --> 00:34:14.638
Are you angry because it was hard to make?

00:34:14.638 --> 00:34:18.238
Do you know how many batches
failed just to make this one bottle?

00:34:18.238 --> 00:34:19.972
- And you call it 'just'?
- So why bother?

00:34:19.972 --> 00:34:21.372
No one asked you, but why?

00:34:21.372 --> 00:34:23.072
Well, obviously...

00:34:29.105 --> 00:34:30.272
Because you are a top-tier employee.

00:34:30.272 --> 00:34:32.572
- What?
- They say you're outstanding.

00:34:32.572 --> 00:34:34.172
Your problem-solving skills are excellent.

00:34:34.172 --> 00:34:36.972
We have so much to tackle together.

00:34:36.972 --> 00:34:40.238
I can't just watch you wear yourself out.

00:34:42.605 --> 00:34:44.605
So I brought something
good for morning sickness,

00:34:44.605 --> 00:34:47.172
yet you are drinking cheap stuff
from another man.

00:34:47.172 --> 00:34:48.572
How could I not get angry?

00:34:48.572 --> 00:34:50.272
What?

00:34:51.238 --> 00:34:52.972
Nothing.

00:35:02.469 --> 00:35:04.438
[Mom]

00:35:15.372 --> 00:35:17.138
Hold on, I need to take this call.

00:35:17.138 --> 00:35:18.838
Yes.

00:35:28.005 --> 00:35:29.972
- Yes.
- Son?

00:35:29.972 --> 00:35:32.305
That high-pitched voice means
another blind date, right?

00:35:32.305 --> 00:35:33.738
If that's what this is about, I don't need...

00:35:33.738 --> 00:35:36.172
Why? Are you seeing someone?

00:35:36.172 --> 00:35:40.538
Don't tell me that's why you asked
for the jujube syrup recipe back then?

00:35:40.538 --> 00:35:43.505
- Mom.
- Well, if not, forget it.

00:35:44.705 --> 00:35:49.072
I met someone really nice
when I went for a massage.

00:35:49.072 --> 00:35:50.805
They say one detail speaks volumes.

00:35:50.805 --> 00:35:54.238
She grew up very upright
under a single father.

00:35:54.238 --> 00:35:56.805
Mom, you don't have prejudice
against things like that, do you?

00:35:56.805 --> 00:35:59.538
I'm saying that because not many
were raised properly in those circumstances.

00:35:59.538 --> 00:36:01.105
Mom, you shouldn't say that.

00:36:01.105 --> 00:36:02.238
Then what about Se Hyeon?

00:36:02.238 --> 00:36:03.638
Se Hyeon turned out fine

00:36:03.638 --> 00:36:05.572
because you played the role
of a father since her childhood.

00:36:05.572 --> 00:36:06.772
No.

00:36:06.772 --> 00:36:09.505
She would've grown up better
if it weren't for me.

00:36:09.505 --> 00:36:12.538
Without pain, just surrounded by love.

00:36:24.133 --> 00:36:27.072
[Mourn]

00:36:27.072 --> 00:36:29.972
Uncle, why are you crying?

00:36:33.305 --> 00:36:35.172
Se Hyeon, you are here.

00:36:41.272 --> 00:36:42.705
I'm not crying.

00:36:42.705 --> 00:36:44.869
- I never cry.
- Where's Dad?

00:36:44.869 --> 00:36:47.605
Why is Dad over there?

00:36:53.205 --> 00:36:54.972
He is...

00:37:07.038 --> 00:37:08.738
I'm sorry.

00:37:10.789 --> 00:37:12.869
I'm sorry.

00:37:20.872 --> 00:37:23.438
I'm outside now. Let's talk later.

00:37:23.438 --> 00:37:25.172
Du Jun.

00:37:37.172 --> 00:37:38.972
Food delivery's here.

00:37:38.972 --> 00:37:40.672
What's the occasion?

00:37:42.838 --> 00:37:46.172
No matter how busy you are, you have to eat.

00:37:46.172 --> 00:37:48.572
You look thinner every time I see you.

00:37:48.572 --> 00:37:49.672
Cut down on the coffee too.

00:37:49.672 --> 00:37:52.072
And stretch your neck
and shoulders more often.

00:37:52.072 --> 00:37:53.272
Okay.

00:37:53.272 --> 00:37:55.872
Hard to tell who's the mom
and who's the daughter.

00:37:55.872 --> 00:37:58.538
Dad would've really liked

00:37:58.538 --> 00:38:00.638
seeing us like this, right?

00:38:01.638 --> 00:38:03.605
Do you miss Dad?

00:38:05.238 --> 00:38:06.238
Not really.

00:38:06.238 --> 00:38:07.572
Uncle's like a dad to me anyway.

00:38:07.572 --> 00:38:10.072
But he isn't your dad.

00:38:10.072 --> 00:38:11.805
Your dad was so good to you.

00:38:11.805 --> 00:38:14.438
Well, I was too young back then.

00:38:14.438 --> 00:38:18.338
If not for that incident, your dad
would've been way better than your uncle.

00:38:18.338 --> 00:38:20.772
Don't say things that would hurt Dad.

00:38:22.005 --> 00:38:23.972
You startled me.

00:38:23.972 --> 00:38:27.738
Alright, let's eat quickly.
You must be hungry, hurry.

I'm okay.

can't take medicine casually?

Oh, that's cold.

and take some rest?

00:52:26.172 --> 00:52:29.338
I'd like to see a report organized
in your unique style.

00:52:29.338 --> 00:52:30.738
It can be done
by the end of this week, right?

00:52:30.738 --> 00:52:33.205
Why are you interfering
with her sleeping schedule?

00:52:33.205 --> 00:52:35.038
From now on, please refrain
from calling Ms. Jang Hui Won

00:52:35.038 --> 00:52:38.438
for personal matters after 7 PM.

00:52:44.645 --> 00:52:46.597
Well.

00:52:53.972 --> 00:52:54.972
[Reserved Parking]

00:52:58.437 --> 00:52:59.877
Let's go home!

00:52:59.877 --> 00:53:01.672
- Time to go!
- Let's go.

00:53:01.672 --> 00:53:03.238
Oh, Assistant Manager Cha.

00:53:03.238 --> 00:53:05.038
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

00:53:05.038 --> 00:53:06.272
Are you heading home now?

00:53:06.272 --> 00:53:09.038
You came for Manager Jang, huh?

00:53:09.038 --> 00:53:11.072
Yes, I came to see
if we could leave together,

00:53:11.072 --> 00:53:12.505
but I don't see her.

00:53:12.505 --> 00:53:15.005
Manager Jang went on
a field trip with the President.

00:53:15.005 --> 00:53:17.005
- I guess you didn't hear.
- A field trip?

00:53:17.005 --> 00:53:18.238
Yes, and just the two of them.

00:53:18.238 --> 00:53:19.672
- Just the two of them?
- Yes.

00:53:19.672 --> 00:53:21.305
They said they're visiting
a hop farm for research.

00:53:21.305 --> 00:53:25.905
I knew Manager Jang was ambitious,
but I didn't realize she was this driven.

00:53:25.905 --> 00:53:28.672
I'd feel uncomfortable
being alone with the President.

00:53:28.672 --> 00:53:32.572
I bet the President feels uncomfortable
being alone with Manager Nah too.

00:53:32.572 --> 00:53:35.305
- Assistant Manager Choi.
- Since they went out,

00:53:35.305 --> 00:53:37.072
will they clock out from there together?

00:53:37.072 --> 00:53:39.572
Well, they'll probably
leave straight from there.

00:53:39.572 --> 00:53:41.572
They say the water
and scenery are beautiful there.

00:53:41.572 --> 00:53:44.205
It feels more like a getaway than work.

00:53:44.205 --> 00:53:46.305
Come on, don't you all know Manager Jang?

00:53:46.305 --> 00:53:49.271
She'll work diligently and return
tomorrow with an amazing idea.

00:53:49.271 --> 00:53:50.272
- Right!
- Probably not?

00:53:50.272 --> 00:53:51.738
Admit it, Manager Jang is passionate!

00:53:51.738 --> 00:53:54.372
Then let's passionately
clock out for the day!

00:53:54.372 --> 00:53:56.072
We should go.

00:53:56.072 --> 00:53:57.605
- Yes.
- Come on in.

00:53:57.605 --> 00:53:59.338
Goodbye.

00:54:01.005 --> 00:54:02.705
See you.

00:54:15.972 --> 00:54:18.638
The farm is larger than I expected
with numerous hop plants,

00:54:18.638 --> 00:54:21.605
so I think future collaboration
would be beneficial.

00:54:21.605 --> 00:54:22.772
Sign a contract with us.

00:54:22.772 --> 00:54:25.038
We'll help you earn five times
your current annual revenue.

00:54:25.038 --> 00:54:28.405
What? Five times?

00:54:28.405 --> 00:54:31.638
I know you already supply domestic hops
to several other breweries.

00:54:31.638 --> 00:54:33.172
We won't interfere with that.

00:54:33.172 --> 00:54:35.872
However, to meet our supply demands,

00:54:35.872 --> 00:54:38.117
you'll need to triple your current
hop production.

00:54:38.117 --> 00:54:39.138
Is that feasible?

00:54:39.138 --> 00:54:41.938
We have to make it happen, of course.

00:54:41.938 --> 00:54:43.572
Oh dear, honey.

00:54:43.572 --> 00:54:47.493
Absolutely. We'll meet the demand
even if we have to hire more help.

00:54:47.493 --> 00:54:51.172
- Oh, wow.
- Thank you.

00:54:51.172 --> 00:54:54.372
You'll be swamped starting tomorrow. Wow.

00:54:54.372 --> 00:54:56.072
You've worked hard.

00:54:57.605 --> 00:55:00.038
You'll get busy soon!

00:55:00.038 --> 00:55:03.638
Don't they look perfect together?

00:55:06.605 --> 00:55:09.605
What is marriage, really?

00:55:09.605 --> 00:55:12.372
How can two people from different lives

00:55:12.372 --> 00:55:14.172
cherish each other like their own selves

00:55:14.172 --> 00:55:16.838
for so long like that?

00:55:16.838 --> 00:55:19.238
Someone said people marry

00:55:19.238 --> 00:55:22.272
because they desperately
need someone on their side.

00:55:22.272 --> 00:55:24.405
Marriage

00:55:24.405 --> 00:55:27.238
completes the insecure part of themselves.

00:55:30.638 --> 00:55:32.438
My side...

00:55:33.772 --> 00:55:35.138
You should've been on my side.

00:55:35.138 --> 00:55:37.405
Even if everyone else turns their backs,

00:55:37.405 --> 00:55:40.205
you should have been with me!

00:55:45.338 --> 00:55:47.905
And if the person you trusted
to be on your side betrays you,

00:55:47.905 --> 00:55:50.372
doesn't it hurt even more?

00:55:52.572 --> 00:55:54.405
Even if you start out inseparable,

00:55:54.405 --> 00:55:56.772
eventually you may end up
as enemies or strangers.

00:55:56.772 --> 00:56:00.438
Maybe it's better not to start at all.

00:56:04.072 --> 00:56:06.072
Is it

00:56:06.072 --> 00:56:08.038
because of your mother?

00:56:08.905 --> 00:56:09.938
[Mom: My life got completely
ruined because of you.]

00:56:09.938 --> 00:56:14.105
My life got completely ruined because of you.

00:56:14.105 --> 00:56:18.105
You should never have been born.

00:56:20.738 --> 00:56:23.172
You don't need to react
to words meant to hurt you.

00:56:23.172 --> 00:56:25.672
It's not your fault. Far from it.

00:56:25.672 --> 00:56:28.905
Did you happen to see my text?

00:56:30.605 --> 00:56:33.105
I didn't mean to see it, sorry.

00:56:33.105 --> 00:56:36.238
But your life is too precious
to be swayed by such words.

00:56:36.238 --> 00:56:37.605
Don't pretend to understand me.

00:56:37.605 --> 00:56:41.438
You grew up sheltered, so you might not
realize how hard that is,

00:56:41.438 --> 00:56:45.638
but for some, it's a lifelong struggle.

00:56:46.372 --> 00:56:48.105
Wait, I...

00:56:58.405 --> 00:57:00.472
Please drop me off here.

00:57:07.238 --> 00:57:09.672
Thank you for the ride.

00:57:09.672 --> 00:57:11.105
I'll should go.

00:57:11.105 --> 00:57:14.005
Are you really leaving like this?

00:57:14.738 --> 00:57:16.172
Thank you for your hard work today.

00:57:16.172 --> 00:57:19.738
I'll send you the hop farm proposal
as soon as it's finalized.

00:57:21.305 --> 00:57:23.038
No...

00:57:34.572 --> 00:57:37.538
You shouldn't take it out
on someone who took your side.

00:57:37.538 --> 00:57:40.505
How pathetic. Truly pathetic, Jang Hui Won.

00:57:47.872 --> 00:57:49.138
Huh?

00:57:49.138 --> 00:57:50.872
Min Uk.

00:57:54.672 --> 00:57:56.538
Where have you been?

00:57:56.538 --> 00:57:58.105
Were you with that person?

00:57:58.105 --> 00:58:00.138
- Huh?
- The baby's father.

00:58:00.138 --> 00:58:03.172
Is it President Kang Du Jun?

00:58:05.772 --> 00:58:07.438
I see.

00:58:07.438 --> 00:58:09.372
I'm sorry, I was going to tell you...

00:58:09.372 --> 00:58:11.472
What about the baby?

00:58:11.472 --> 00:58:13.272
Have you decided?

00:58:14.705 --> 00:58:15.905
I'm going to keep it.

00:58:15.905 --> 00:58:18.072
- Hui Won.
- I'm not giving up my dream.

00:58:18.072 --> 00:58:19.305
I'm just postponing it.

00:58:19.305 --> 00:58:24.072
After giving birth, I'll thrive
and do everything I want.

00:58:26.338 --> 00:58:28.805
But you said you didn't want marriage.

00:58:28.805 --> 00:58:30.772
And now you plan to keep it
and raise it alone?

00:58:30.772 --> 00:58:34.238
I can do it. I can.

00:58:35.872 --> 00:58:37.572
While you're thinking about this,

00:58:37.572 --> 00:58:40.538
where is he, and what is he doing?

00:58:40.538 --> 00:58:42.205
Shouldn't there be some plan?

00:58:42.205 --> 00:58:44.672
He said he would take responsibility.

00:58:44.672 --> 00:58:45.805
I refused.

00:58:45.805 --> 00:58:47.138
He said he'd take responsibility?

00:58:47.138 --> 00:58:49.405
Is he saying you should marry him or what?

00:58:49.405 --> 00:58:51.173
A chaebol heir who can
do anything with money,

00:58:51.173 --> 00:58:53.172
can he really do that just because of a kid?

00:58:53.172 --> 00:58:54.872
What if I can?

00:58:57.872 --> 00:59:02.005
I don't understand why this
is impossible right now.

00:59:02.005 --> 00:59:04.605
- President...
- If something like this happened,

00:59:04.605 --> 00:59:05.605
wouldn't you take responsibility?

00:59:05.605 --> 00:59:07.838
I wouldn't create
such an awkward situation in the first place.

00:59:07.838 --> 00:59:08.838
Hey.

00:59:08.838 --> 00:59:12.005
If you're planning to use
Hui Won, stop right here.

00:59:12.005 --> 00:59:16.038
She's not someone
for people like you to toy with.

00:59:16.038 --> 00:59:18.638
I've never thought of it that way.

00:59:20.805 --> 00:59:22.405
Do you think so too, Ms. Jang Hui Won?

00:59:22.405 --> 00:59:24.005
Do you think I'm toying with you?

00:59:24.005 --> 00:59:26.105
What?

00:59:26.105 --> 00:59:29.638
Then why not check if that's true?

00:59:29.638 --> 00:59:32.572
See whether I'm being sincere now.

00:59:35.338 --> 00:59:38.938
Lately, I don't know
why I'm having these thoughts.

00:59:38.938 --> 00:59:40.505
You'll help, right?

00:59:40.505 --> 00:59:41.538
Ugh, I don't know.

00:59:41.538 --> 00:59:44.138
Oh, do you want some meat, Your Highness?

00:59:44.138 --> 00:59:47.138
I shall prepare the meat, Your Highness.

00:59:47.138 --> 00:59:50.372
I get angry just seeing
her giggle with another guy.

00:59:50.372 --> 00:59:55.338
I gave up my lifelong dream
with my own hands.

00:59:55.338 --> 00:59:58.972
If I don't work now,
I feel like I'll actually die.

00:59:58.972 --> 01:00:00.838
Please stop telling me to rest.

01:00:00.838 --> 01:00:03.272
When she agonizes between work
and the baby, I feel sorry for her.

01:00:03.272 --> 01:00:05.272
How can you only think
about yourself until the very end?

01:00:05.272 --> 01:00:10.005
If I were you, I would never
live like you, understand?

01:00:17.272 --> 01:00:18.872
If she's crying alone,

01:00:18.872 --> 01:00:21.638
it bothers me a lot.

01:00:21.638 --> 01:00:24.605
I even wonder why I'm
talking about this right now.

01:00:24.605 --> 01:00:26.772
It's just that...

01:00:26.772 --> 01:00:30.972
I want you to feel a bit
at ease, at least for today.

01:00:41.138 --> 01:00:42.838
Does this mean

01:00:43.805 --> 01:00:46.238
I'm falling for you?

01:01:03.205 --> 01:01:05.238
[Epilogue]

01:01:05.238 --> 01:01:07.705
- Daddy.
- Daddy.

01:01:07.705 --> 01:01:09.705
Daddy, don't go.

01:01:09.705 --> 01:01:11.138
Don't go.

01:01:11.138 --> 01:01:12.805
Daddy.

01:01:12.805 --> 01:01:14.372
Daddy.

01:01:14.372 --> 01:01:18.005
Don't leave Mom behind.

01:01:18.005 --> 01:01:19.838
Daddy.

01:01:21.438 --> 01:01:23.272
Daddy.

01:01:23.272 --> 01:01:25.872
It isn't easy for you either.

01:01:25.872 --> 01:01:27.605
Daddy.

01:01:51.838 --> 01:01:54.272
I'm not leaving.

01:01:54.272 --> 01:01:55.972
Never.

01:02:36.672 --> 01:02:38.172
Are you avoiding me?

01:02:38.172 --> 01:02:40.505
It seems like you've been burdened
because of my confession.

01:02:40.505 --> 01:02:41.605
Don't avoid me.

01:02:41.605 --> 01:02:42.838
You like your friend, huh?

01:02:42.838 --> 01:02:44.272
Why are you just watching and doing nothing?

01:02:44.272 --> 01:02:45.272
How truly vulgar.

01:02:45.272 --> 01:02:47.772
The liquor model got a DUI?
Isn't that insane?

01:02:47.772 --> 01:02:49.272
If we can't fix this,

01:02:49.272 --> 01:02:51.072
it'll be hard to keep our footing.

01:02:51.072 --> 01:02:52.205
Then we must find

01:02:52.205 --> 01:02:53.905
a new model to revitalize our image.

01:02:53.905 --> 01:02:55.305
Well, my colleagues.

01:02:55.305 --> 01:02:57.438
How would they react
if they found out I'm pregnant?

01:02:57.438 --> 01:02:58.505
Why? Did anyone say anything to you?

01:02:58.505 --> 01:03:00.672
- She's pregnant!
- Wow! How'd she seduce him?

01:03:00.672 --> 01:03:02.072
Well, anyone can get pregnant.

01:03:02.072 --> 01:03:04.972
What matters is whose child it is.

01:03:04.972 --> 01:03:09.172
If it gets tough this time,
will you just give up again?
