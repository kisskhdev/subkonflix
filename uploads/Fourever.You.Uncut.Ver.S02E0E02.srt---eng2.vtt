WEBVTT

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.451


00:00:09.314 --> 00:00:11.029
To Thorfun.

00:00:11.368 --> 00:00:12.751
Phoon has arrived in Chiang Mai.

00:00:13.177 --> 00:00:14.965
Today, Phoon happened to run into P'Fah as well.

00:00:15.205 --> 00:00:16.684
And Phoon lied,

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.577
saying that Fun is doing fine.

00:00:21.401 --> 00:00:23.103
Do you want to stay in P'Fah’s room tonight?

00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:26.197
You’ll stay with me until I fall asleep, right?

00:00:26.877 --> 00:00:27.665
Yes.

00:00:28.299 --> 00:00:29.441
Uh, Phoon.

00:00:29.594 --> 00:00:31.392
Can I have Fun’s LINE ID?

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.164
Are you dating anyone right now?

00:00:36.237 --> 00:00:37.505
I’m not dating anyone.

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.659
I can’t be the sky for anyone.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.790
Can you be the sky for me?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.190
Is that not allowed?

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.930
Phoon.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.050
Phoon. Phoon.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.030
Yes?

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.430
Are you okay? You suddenly went quiet.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:09.990
Oh.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.810
I’m fine.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.650
I thought you were bored with what Fah was talking about.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.380
Looks like it’s about to rain. Should we head back?

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.180
Let’s go.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.910
Hey, Jo. Where have you been?

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.760
Just running some errands. What about you?

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:00.910
Out.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.190
You didn’t even wear a raincoat. You’ll catch a cold.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.650
I’ll be fine.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:08.920
Where are you heading next?

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.400
Back to my condo.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.950
And damn it, it’s raining again.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.320
What about you?

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.280
I’m heading back too.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.620
- Drive safe.
- You too.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.320
- See you.
- Bye.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.380
Was that your friend?

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.270
Yes.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.470
What’s his name?

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.390
His name is Johan.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.040
Oh, P’Johan.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:42.690
Why?

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:43.780
Interested?

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.100
No.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.890
If I were to recommend someone,

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.560
Jo would be the last person I’d recommend.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.360
No—second to last.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:56.670
The last one would be Arthit.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.080
Hmm. Why is that?

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.450
He’s not a very good person.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.100
If I were to recommend someone from the group,

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.200
I’d want you to meet Hill the most.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.260
Why do you think you need to introduce someone to me?

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.810
I just think it’d be good if you had someone to look after.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.620
And if there’s going to be someone, I want them to be a good, trustworthy person.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.620
So if you date anyone, they have to pass Thorfun first, right?

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.900
Yes.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.560
Then they’ll have to pass me too.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.890
I am your brother, after all.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.100
Looks like the power’s about to go out again.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.660
Will you be okay?

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:26.930
Uh…

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.750
Honestly…

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.170
Do you want to stay in P'Fah’s room tonight?

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.110
Yes.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.210
Sorry for bothering you again.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:04.780
It’s okay.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.070
I just ordered this.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:15.550
May I sit here?

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:16.780
Sure.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:27.600
Here’s some water.

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.740
I think it’d be better if you moved dorms.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.210
I’ll find a new place for you.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.110
My dad might scold me.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.140
He'd already paid the deposit.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.960
Then I’ll talk to your dad myself.

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:59.430
May I have your dad’s number?

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.640
I’ve sent you my dad’s number.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.290
Wait a moment. I’ll talk to your dad for you.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:39.540
Aren’t you going to bed yet?

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.990
Then I’ll go to bed first.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:46.800
Mm.

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:57.280
Who is it?

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:01.540
Hello?

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.840
Hello, Uncle. This is Tonfah.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:07.520
Oh, Tonfah?

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.700
You startled me. I was wondering who it was.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:15.610
Why are you calling? Is something wrong?

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.980
It’s about Phoon.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:21.180
About Phoon?

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.120
What is it?

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:26.750
About the dorm you chose for Phoon.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.980
It’s not very good.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.990
So I thought it’d be better for him to move.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.350
But I wanted to ask for your permission first.

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:39.980
I had no idea the dorm wasn’t good.

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.750
I’ve recently changed jobs and have been very busy.

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.770
So I asked my secretary to handle the booking.

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.070
I see.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.390
Alright then.

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:51.800
Tonfah studies here too?

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:53.050
I had no idea.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.480
Yes, I study here, and I happened to run into Typhoon.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:00.250
What? You ran into Typhoon too?

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:02.910
How was he?

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.290
Did he say anything or tell you something?

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:10.610
He didn’t say anything.

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:15.390
Did he mention Thorfun at all?

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.140
I heard she’s studying medicine near home, right?

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.520
Then I’ll take care of Typhoon myself.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.240
Including finding a new dorm.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.490
Then I’ll leave Typhoon in your care.

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.090
Yes, uncle. Don’t worry.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:41.180
How are you?

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.560
We’ll go look for a new dorm together.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:45.930
Did Dad allow it?

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.330
Yes.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:00.440
P’Fah.

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:02.060
Is something wrong?

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.660
No.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.860
You should go take a shower.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.330
You’ve been tired all day. Get some rest.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.390
Did Typhoon mention Thorfun at all?

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:33.320
Where are you, Fun?

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.470
Tomorrow morning, I’ll pick you up. Rith wants to talk to you.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.590
Are you sure you don’t want P’Fah to take you?

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:12.610
I’m sure.

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:13.950
Uncle said he’d come pick me up.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:16.660
They suddenly flew to Chiang Mai like this.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:18.160
Is something wrong?

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.000
Is it about what P’Fah called about last night?

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.110
I don’t know.

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:26.880
I’ll get going now.

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:28.440
Okay.

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.540
Why did you suddenly come to Chiang Mai?

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:13.980
Rith already had business with a client here.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:18.290
It suddenly got moved to today last night.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.020
It’s about P’Fah, right?

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:25.490
Probably.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:27.900
Is Dad angry?

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.780
I warned you not to get involved with Tonfah.

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:36.550
If Tonfah’s family finds out about his divorce,

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:40.820
because Thorfun’s mother caught him with another woman,

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.260
and knew about you who is his child—

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.550
An illegitimate child.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:53.690
That’s right.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:55.500
That’s why he doesn’t dare face them.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.570
He hasn’t contacted that family for years.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.320
But—

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.010
P’Fah’s parents aren’t like that.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:04.910
I know.

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.310
But Typhoon should know his father well.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.780
Rith really respects Tonfah’s parents.

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:14.990
He’s afraid of being seen badly.

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:18.430
And that it might affect his career.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.540
You have to understand him.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:24.770
I understand.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.730
You really are a good kid.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.060
Even after everything he’s done to you,

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:34.880
you still love him and respect him as your father.

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.370
He’s the only family I have left.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:13.370
Typhoon.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.170
You already knew Tonfah studies here, didn’t you?

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:18.820
Yes.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.640
But I didn’t think I’d run into him this soon.

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:24.970
What did you tell him?

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:28.830
I didn’t tell him anything.

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:35.370
What exactly do you want?

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:37.990
Wasn’t killing my daughter enough for you?

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:41.020
You even made Wit and Pha see me badly.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:42.700
I already told you, didn’t I?

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.750
You can study wherever you want,

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.570
but stay away from Tonfah.

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:47.720
Do you understand?

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:52.380
Or are you planning to tell Tonfah about Thorfun?

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:55.210
That you killed your own sister?

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:58.100
He must be so proud of you.

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:01.450
I didn’t kill Fun.

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:03.380
I didn’t mean to.

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:05.100
So you’re saying you’re not at fault?

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.340
Look at what’s happened to me.

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:10.890
Everything has fallen apart.

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:15.790
My family was torn apart.
And you’re saying you did nothing wrong?

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.490
Remember this—no one wants you.

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.120
I never even wanted you to be born.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:26.330
Do you know your mother abandoned you when you were little?

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.860
And now no one even knows where she is.

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:31.030
If it weren’t for Thorfun’s mother,

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:36.710
you wouldn’t even be standing here.
Look at how you repaid us.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:38.870
You killed our child.

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:43.750
And remember this well—

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:48.530
no one sees you as family except Thorfun and Tonfah.

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:51.890
Once Thorfun died,

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.720
you crawled back to Tonfah,

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:57.560
thinking he wouldn’t abandon you, right?

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:01.980
Dad, can I stay with P’Fah?

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:04.910
I won’t say anything. I promise.

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:07.720
Yes, you have to promise.

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.400
Because if you tell him,

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:12.850
he’ll abandon you anyway.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.840
Because you’re afraid he’ll hate you, right?

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:17.440
Right?

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:24.580
You have to withdraw from university within this week.

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:30.410
Dad.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.480
You already sold the house in Phuket.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:36.140
If I withdraw too, where am I supposed to go?

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.820
Where you go is your problem. I don’t care.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:44.320
But you must stay as far away from Tonfah’s family as possible.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.030
The farther, the better.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:49.400
As for money, I’ll have Kong handle it.

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:51.180
Remember this.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.680
Don’t ever let me see your face again.

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.460
Do you understand?

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:04.260
Dad, please don’t.

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:06.690
Please don’t abandon me.

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:08.930
I’m sorry.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:11.220
I was wrong.

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:15.710
No matter what it is, it’s my fault.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.410
I’m the only one at fault.

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:23.640
I never wanted to be born just to ruin your life.

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:29.650
I’ll stay quiet, but please…
don’t abandon me.

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:32.700
If you still see me as your dad,

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.280
then you must stop getting involved with Tonfah.

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:29.010
P’Fah.

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.610
Yes, P’Fah?

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.590
You didn’t reply, so I called.

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:46.010
Are you still with your dad?

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:49.220
No.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.460
I just got back to my room.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:56.940
P’Fah.

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:57.940
Yes?

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:04.060
Are you free these days?

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:07.930
Yeah, I am.

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:09.110
Why?

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:14.460
Could you take me out somewhere?

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:16.740
Please?

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:21.700
I really want to go out with you.

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:25.380
Sure. Where do you want to go?

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.660
Anywhere.

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:37.270
As long as you’re with me.

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:41.090
I want to go everywhere with you.

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.820
Are you okay?

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:48.660
What does your dad say?

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.680
Dad just came up for work.

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:54.770
So he stopped by to see me.

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:57.300
I see.

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:00.430
Uh…

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:02.600
I’ll hang up now, P’Fah.

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.360
If Fun were still here,

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:26.340
everything would be better.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.820
Why did it have to be you who left?

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:34.870
Why was I the one left behind?

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:39.250
Why couldn’t it have been me instead?

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:29.270
Typhoon.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.360
Are you okay?

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.650
It’s okay.

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:43.090
I think Dad might be stressed about work.

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:46.150
So he may have lost his temper.

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:47.830
Failing this exam—

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:49.470
it’s okay.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:51.960
You can retake it next time.

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.150
Can you stop saying that?

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.600
How can you say it’s okay?

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:00.800
You’d never understand me.

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:04.080
Everyone loves you.

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:07.250
I’m just bad luck.

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:10.950
No matter what I do, it’s never good enough.

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.020
This house doesn’t even need me.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:20.470
Don’t say that.
What do you want me to do for you?

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.290
There’s nothing you can do for me.

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:32.130
Typhoon.

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.460
You’re leaving again?

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:42.790
Can’t you stay?

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.360
Don’t call to chase after me.

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:46.110
Go.

00:23:18.352 --> 00:23:19.500
I’ll be back.

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:27.310
Typhoon.

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:28.560
Where are you?

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.530
Why is it so loud?

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:33.330
I told you not to call.

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.520
Let’s go home, okay?

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:36.460
I’m not going back.

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:39.680
Can’t we talk properly?

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:41.970
There’s nothing to talk about, damn it.

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:44.930
Stop calling me already. You’re annoying.

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:46.100
Typhoon.

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:01.450
Hey!

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:08.530
You just bumped into me.

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:11.470
Hey!

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:17.640
What the hell?

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.930
Stop calling already!

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:30.560
Typhoon, what happened?

00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:32.320
Are you okay?

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:34.410
Hello, Typhoon.

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:37.440
Stay right there. I’m coming to you.

00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:58.120
Still so young.

00:24:58.250 --> 00:24:59.260
Such a shame.

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:01.280
A good kid, top of the class.

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:03.710
So much potential. What a waste.

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:05.880
I heard she snuck out at night.

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:08.710
And then a drunk driver came the wrong way.

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:11.120
- Wow.
- She died on the spot.

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:12.700
That’s so pitiful.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.910
Why did she take the car out so late at night anyway?

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:22.480
They said her younger brother got into a fight at a bar.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.570
She was worried, so she rushed to find him.

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:29.120
Such bad karma, having a younger brother like that.

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:31.730
So young, yet already going into bars.

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:36.950
And he doesn’t even study.
The only sister he could rely on passed away first.

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.070
Mm.

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:41.800
I heard both the father and mother were arguing about it.

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:46.260
No one wanted to take the younger brother in.

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.450
- Really?
- Yeah, that’s what I heard.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.810
You little bastard! You damn kid!

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:57.930
You got my child killed!

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:00.290
You killed my child!

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:10.850
I’m sorry.

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:18.100
You damn kid, remember this — you should never have been born as my child.

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:21.260
Where are you going? Wait!

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:29.270
After that, our family fell apart.

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:33.970
So broken that it could never be put back together again.

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:39.660
That’s enough. I won’t put up with you anymore.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.800
Why? What did I do?

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.330
You’re just a womanizer, sleeping with anyone you please.

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:49.330
Even after marrying me, you got another woman pregnant.

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:51.090
Shut up. Stop talking.

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.830
Do you know how much I’ve endured raising that child for over ten years?

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:56.150
That’s already more than enough.

00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:03.320
Every time I see his face, I see how badly our family failed,
how utterly broken it became. Do you even know that?

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:05.870
I told you, I didn’t mean to get that woman pregnant.

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:10.490
He’s an illegitimate child, and he caused my child’s death.

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:13.520
Why wasn’t it that kid who died?

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:15.710
Why did it have to be Fun?

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:18.880
Why did it have to be my child?

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:21.480
Still crying like always.

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:30.560
Faun.

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:40.690
I’ve missed you all this time.

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:43.490
I know.

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:46.420
You wrote to me every single day.

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:54.570
I missed you too.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:06.080
You’ve been through so many terrible things, haven’t you?

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:11.190
I’m sorry.

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:14.470
I’m sorry I wasn’t there with you.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:22.330
I’m sorry too. I’m sorry… I’m sorry, Fun.

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:28.340
None of this is your fault.

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:45.100
Don’t cling to me anymore.

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:48.140
You have to move forward.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:50.890
Do you understand?

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.650
Please love yourself.

00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:59.740
Just like I loved you, okay?

00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:03.810
Would it be okay…

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:08.240
if I don’t want to endure anymore?

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:12.280
If I just let everything end…

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:16.210
and stop trying altogether?

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:20.320
Then I could finally go be with you.

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:21.910
Phoon.

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:30.040
Don’t hurt the person I love.

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.570
You have to take care of yourself.

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:43.870
Eat good food.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.390
Take yourself to good places.

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.770
Tell yourself you love yourself often.

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:56.490
Can you promise me?

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:01.150
Live for me.

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:40.610
Live for me.

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:17.570
Thank you for coming to see me.

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:20.110
Thank you so much.

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:29.930
Feel free to take a look.

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:40.200
Do you like it?

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:43.060
I do.

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:45.650
Can we move in today?

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:49.050
Well, you’ve already paid the deposit.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.660
You can move in right away if you want.

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:07.330
P'Fah.

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:08.200
Yes?

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:12.270
I’ll hurry and earn money to pay it back.

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:15.650
No need. Your father entrusted that money to me.

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:18.770
My dad?

00:32:19.998 --> 00:32:20.950
Yes.

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:28.340
Then shall we start moving your things?

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.600
I’ll go with you.

00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:48.250
Fun'd been busy lately? I texted her but she didn’t reply.

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:55.100
Well…

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.120
I guess so.

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:01.690
Oh.

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:07.030
At first, I thought…

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.650
you’d study photography.

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:24.220
P'Fah.

00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:25.790
Yes?

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:30.270
I’m going to take the medical school exam.

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:39.220
Really?

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:42.400
Yes.

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:45.000
Then…

00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:48.170
you’ll study here first and take the exam later, right?

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:54.990
Uh…

00:33:55.414 --> 00:33:56.192
Yes.

00:33:59.314 --> 00:34:00.980
P'Fah, could you…

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:03.460
help tutor me?

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.260
Well…

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:09.100
Of course I can.

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:10.690
But if we’re going to tutor,

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.340
you have to promise not to quit halfway.

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.210
You have to keep studying until the exam.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.860
Can you promise me that?

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:21.270
Until the exam...

00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:24.000
Yes.

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:27.710
Many students who start tutoring tend to change their minds halfway.

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:30.870
The tutor ends up feeling a bit hurt too.

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:33.370
But still—

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:36.690
The exam is still months away.

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:41.000
Can you promise me you'll stay until then?

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:46.990
Hmm?

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:48.100
Yes.

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:50.350
I promise.

00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:58.460
Why did you make that face?

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:03.220
You finally call yourself “Phoon” again like before.

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:07.070
Is that strange?

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.790
Not at all. It’s much better.

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:13.250
You’re the same, P’Fah.

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:16.240
You always refer to yourself as P’Fah.

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:21.540
That’s true.

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:28.390
Do you usually refer to yourself like that?

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:31.320
I only do that with you, Phoon.

00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:34.560
Do you remember why?

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:39.800
When we were kids—

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:41.970
There were a lot of kids in our neighborhood.

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:44.080
If I just called myself “P’,”

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.080
You’d get confused about which one.

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:48.090
So I used my name instead.

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:49.570
So you’d know.

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:51.040
Oh.

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:13.800
Thank you for helping me move dorms.

00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:18.590
Honestly, thank you for everything.

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:21.260
It’s no big deal.

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:29.430
I have to go now. I’m tutoring a junior.

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.130
Okay.

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:36.610
See you. Call me if you need anything.

00:37:21.647 --> 00:37:24.287
Do the homework on page 15.

00:37:25.681 --> 00:37:28.336
And, um...

00:37:29.115 --> 00:37:30.722
That should be enough for today.

00:37:32.256 --> 00:37:32.991
See you.

00:38:05.259 --> 00:38:06.090
P’Fah.

00:38:14.711 --> 00:38:16.303
Hello, P’Fah?

00:38:17.256 --> 00:38:17.971
Phoon.

00:38:18.204 --> 00:38:19.752
Is the new dorm all set?

00:38:20.665 --> 00:38:22.034
All set.

00:38:22.265 --> 00:38:23.641
It suddenly started raining.

00:38:23.868 --> 00:38:25.863
I was worried about a blackout, so I called.

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:39.762
Mm.

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.743
It’s just raining.

00:38:46.103 --> 00:38:47.005
P’Fah.

00:38:47.834 --> 00:38:48.651
Yes?

00:38:49.447 --> 00:38:50.980
What if—

00:38:51.314 --> 00:38:53.081
It’s a place where it rains all the time,

00:38:53.632 --> 00:38:54.657
Then—

00:38:54.949 --> 00:38:56.484
How do people

00:38:57.029 --> 00:38:58.234
live there?

00:38:58.463 --> 00:38:59.512
There is a place like that.

00:38:59.776 --> 00:39:01.334
Meghalaya State, India.

00:39:01.967 --> 00:39:04.751
It gets over 10,800 millimeters of rain a year.

00:39:04.967 --> 00:39:06.435
That’s nine times more than Thailand.

00:39:06.921 --> 00:39:09.299
They adapt by building steep roofs,

00:39:09.579 --> 00:39:10.533
So water doesn’t pool.

00:39:11.035 --> 00:39:12.029
They raise their houses,

00:39:12.208 --> 00:39:13.288
Grow rain-resistant crops,

00:39:13.777 --> 00:39:16.339
And always carry flashlights and umbrellas.

00:39:17.565 --> 00:39:18.557
You could say

00:39:18.834 --> 00:39:20.394
Rain is just normal there.

00:39:20.773 --> 00:39:22.281
Clear skies would be the strange thing.

00:39:22.709 --> 00:39:23.927
But some people—

00:39:24.087 --> 00:39:26.715
Learn to be happy in the rain.

00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:31.240
Learning to be happy in the rain.

00:39:35.085 --> 00:39:36.014
That’s true.

00:39:37.765 --> 00:39:38.684
Phoon.

00:39:39.373 --> 00:39:41.702
You’re serious about becoming a doctor, right?

00:39:43.651 --> 00:39:45.004
Of course.

00:39:45.357 --> 00:39:47.813
Good. I’ll prepare the materials.

00:39:48.112 --> 00:39:49.542
Shall we start tutoring tomorrow?

00:39:50.552 --> 00:39:51.432
Sure.

00:39:52.472 --> 00:39:53.725
Isn’t that too soon?

00:39:53.997 --> 00:39:55.785
You still have plenty of time.

00:40:04.008 --> 00:40:05.463
I don’t have much time.

00:40:37.742 --> 00:40:38.699
P’Fah.

00:40:45.688 --> 00:40:46.848
Have you been waiting long?

00:40:47.325 --> 00:40:48.392
Not at all.

00:40:49.345 --> 00:40:51.219
Do you want anything? I’ll order for you.

00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:53.029
Hmm.

00:40:53.299 --> 00:40:54.484
I’ll have an iced latte.

00:40:54.585 --> 00:40:55.703
Got it.

00:41:00.637 --> 00:41:01.565
One iced latte, please.

00:41:10.023 --> 00:41:11.456
Thank you.

00:41:12.351 --> 00:41:13.619
Here you go.

00:41:20.637 --> 00:41:21.453
P’Fah, look.

00:41:23.208 --> 00:41:24.675
The sky is so beautiful today.

00:41:25.431 --> 00:41:27.207
Even though it rained hard last night.

00:41:28.502 --> 00:41:29.536
That’s really nice.

00:41:29.798 --> 00:41:31.951
That the sky can make you smile like this.

00:41:35.788 --> 00:41:36.882
Phoon.

00:41:37.558 --> 00:41:38.337
Yes?

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:41.247
You’re smiling, you know?

00:41:44.057 --> 00:41:44.900
Yes.

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:48.988
And do you realize it?

00:41:52.324 --> 00:41:54.659
That you suit a smile more than anything.

00:41:54.958 --> 00:41:56.223
Smile a lot, okay?

00:42:00.071 --> 00:42:01.025
Oh.

00:42:01.854 --> 00:42:04.192
About today’s tutoring—

00:42:09.149 --> 00:42:09.934
Let me see.

00:42:33.924 --> 00:42:34.924
How do I do this?

00:42:34.968 --> 00:42:36.155
Okay, come on.

00:42:43.134 --> 00:42:45.574
Ah, this one. Read the question first, Phoon.

00:42:46.285 --> 00:42:50.642
They’re asking for a unit vector in the same direction as U, which equals U.

00:42:50.877 --> 00:42:54.894
and the absolute value of U, first we think about—

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:56.472
What is a vector?

00:42:56.952 --> 00:42:58.444
A vector is—

00:42:58.917 --> 00:43:01.130
Vector comes from—

00:43:04.278 --> 00:43:05.315
What are you looking at?

00:43:07.048 --> 00:43:08.691
If you don’t finish this problem,

00:43:09.977 --> 00:43:11.440
I won’t let you go home.

00:43:51.515 --> 00:43:52.376
Phoon.

00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:54.174
Let’s sit for a bit.

00:44:43.345 --> 00:44:47.543
Up ahead is the clock tower. When you come to class, you’ll see this clock tower.

00:44:48.394 --> 00:44:49.785
And this is the dormitory.

00:44:52.263 --> 00:44:53.737
The cafeteria is on the left.

00:44:56.628 --> 00:44:57.404
On the left.

00:45:02.391 --> 00:45:03.992
That’s the right, Phoon.

00:45:34.709 --> 00:45:36.440
I thought you didn’t like taking photos of people.

00:45:36.678 --> 00:45:38.592
Why have you been taking so many of me lately?

00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:43.168
I want to keep these moments as much as possible.

00:45:45.567 --> 00:45:46.604
And photographs

00:45:47.451 --> 00:45:49.097
Are the clearest proof.

00:45:52.595 --> 00:45:54.438
Like how you like taking pictures of Fun, right?

00:46:39.831 --> 00:46:41.106
Your time is up.

00:46:44.616 --> 00:46:45.546
I know.

00:46:52.031 --> 00:46:53.770
Let me stay with P'Fah a little longer.

00:46:54.115 --> 00:46:55.392
Until the semester starts.

00:46:58.666 --> 00:47:01.287
After that, I won’t interfere with P'Fah ever again.

00:47:04.733 --> 00:47:06.592
And if you guys run into each other at the university?

00:47:07.914 --> 00:47:09.161
I’ll pretend I didn’t see him.

00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:11.644
Like we’re strangers.

00:47:15.088 --> 00:47:16.842
And if Tonfah doesn’t agree?

00:47:19.084 --> 00:47:20.937
I’ll make him hate me.

00:47:23.302 --> 00:47:24.626
So much he won’t even want to look at me.

00:47:27.029 --> 00:47:28.831
Just make sure you do what you said.

00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:58.041
P’Fah.

00:50:15.118 --> 00:50:17.980
I’m not free today. Let’s cancel the tutoring session.

00:50:18.674 --> 00:50:21.149
It’s okay. Are you free tomorrow?

00:50:27.703 --> 00:50:28.672
I’m not.

00:50:30.028 --> 00:50:32.200
Then when are you free?

00:50:39.041 --> 00:50:40.094
I’m not free anymore.

00:51:40.075 --> 00:51:41.020
Aren’t you eating?

00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:45.515
I told you, I’m not hungry.

00:51:50.134 --> 00:51:51.306
Please eat a little.

00:51:54.945 --> 00:51:56.293
I said I’m not eating.

00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:02.770
I’m sorry.

00:52:06.837 --> 00:52:08.392
Did I do something wrong?

00:52:17.671 --> 00:52:18.428
I’ll head back first.

00:52:20.502 --> 00:52:22.099
How will you get home?

00:52:24.514 --> 00:52:25.514
I’ll call a taxi.

00:52:37.616 --> 00:52:40.223
Happy birthday, Johan!

00:52:40.414 --> 00:52:42.463
Bottoms up! Hey, Fah!

00:52:46.746 --> 00:52:48.908
Everyone!

00:52:49.226 --> 00:52:51.462
Today’s my friend Johan’s birthday.

00:52:52.841 --> 00:52:54.102
One big sip!

00:52:54.722 --> 00:52:56.444
Alright, together!

00:52:57.617 --> 00:53:00.106
Hey!

00:53:01.703 --> 00:53:04.768
Whoever finishes their glass gets cash!

00:53:06.068 --> 00:53:07.125
You’re ridiculous.

00:53:07.311 --> 00:53:11.480
Come on, enjoy it. Have some fun!

00:53:13.114 --> 00:53:14.795
It’d be way more fun without you.

00:53:17.405 --> 00:53:18.355
Hey!

00:53:18.485 --> 00:53:22.336
Alright, bottoms up! Cheers!

00:53:22.475 --> 00:53:24.237
- Come on, Fah!
- Where’d you come from, so hungry?

00:53:24.528 --> 00:53:25.389
Fah!

00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:27.656
Fah!

00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:31.722
Hey, Fah!

00:53:33.539 --> 00:53:34.391
What?

00:53:34.518 --> 00:53:35.625
What’s wrong with you?

00:53:38.023 --> 00:53:39.848
Nothing. I’m fine.

00:53:41.761 --> 00:53:43.914
I’m gonna step outside for some air.

00:53:48.629 --> 00:53:49.487
What’s with him?

00:53:50.075 --> 00:53:52.506
- What’s his problem?
- How would I know?

00:54:03.016 --> 00:54:04.278
Hey, go talk to him.

00:54:07.149 --> 00:54:08.013
This killed the mood.

00:54:11.808 --> 00:54:12.634
What’s wrong?

00:54:19.746 --> 00:54:20.906
Got something you wanna talk about?

00:54:26.788 --> 00:54:27.949
Do you think I’m okay?

00:54:29.037 --> 00:54:30.285
What do you mean?

00:54:33.198 --> 00:54:34.194
Everything.

00:54:34.851 --> 00:54:35.991
Who I am.

00:54:36.814 --> 00:54:37.724
My personality.

00:54:38.614 --> 00:54:40.047
The things I do.

00:54:40.337 --> 00:54:41.520
The things I say.

00:54:42.555 --> 00:54:43.776
Is there anything wrong with me?

00:54:45.595 --> 00:54:47.620
What made you lose your confidence like this?

00:54:53.293 --> 00:54:54.574
My brother.

00:54:56.358 --> 00:54:57.628
Your brother?

00:54:59.385 --> 00:55:00.042
Yeah.

00:55:01.613 --> 00:55:03.588
The kid next door when I lived in Phuket.

00:55:05.432 --> 00:55:07.077
He happened to study here.

00:55:07.629 --> 00:55:09.478
So we ran into each other again.

00:55:11.143 --> 00:55:12.337
Back then,

00:55:12.851 --> 00:55:14.031
We were really close.

00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:16.991
He is someone I can’t help but worry about.

00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:22.185
So much that it makes me want to take good care of him.

00:55:23.970 --> 00:55:26.188
But ever since I moved out of the house,

00:55:27.148 --> 00:55:28.878
and stopped contacting him,

00:55:30.155 --> 00:55:31.533
I’ve felt guilty ever since.

00:55:34.432 --> 00:55:35.416
And now,

00:55:36.284 --> 00:55:37.743
that we finally get to see each other again,

00:55:38.546 --> 00:55:40.568
I just want to make up for the time we lost.

00:55:41.785 --> 00:55:42.724
But…

00:55:45.361 --> 00:55:46.709
He is not okay with you anymore?

00:55:50.905 --> 00:55:52.770
At first, it seemed fine.

00:55:53.628 --> 00:55:54.635
But then suddenly,

00:55:54.805 --> 00:55:56.336
he started pulling away.

00:55:57.272 --> 00:55:58.739
He doesn't answer my calls.

00:55:59.065 --> 00:56:00.817
And barely reply to my messages.

00:56:01.988 --> 00:56:03.407
It’s like he doesn't want to see me anymore.

00:56:05.777 --> 00:56:07.170
So I started thinking that

00:56:09.530 --> 00:56:11.207
maybe it’s better if no need to have me around.

00:56:14.275 --> 00:56:16.949
While you were gone, did anything happen to him?

00:56:26.106 --> 00:56:27.308
It seems like

00:56:27.567 --> 00:56:29.065
his parents got divorced.

00:56:29.998 --> 00:56:32.801
But his dad and older sister

00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:35.207
are still living with him like before.

00:56:39.271 --> 00:56:40.745
Do you think he's hiding something from you?

00:56:44.971 --> 00:56:45.961
Hiding something?

00:56:48.284 --> 00:56:49.078
Maybe.

00:56:49.605 --> 00:56:50.878
I don’t really know.

00:56:51.888 --> 00:56:54.967
All I know is that this already makes he feel really bad about me.

00:56:56.044 --> 00:56:57.811
I don’t dare do anything at all, Hill.

00:56:58.148 --> 00:56:59.271
It feels like

00:56:59.557 --> 00:57:01.262
if I make even the slightest wrong move,

00:57:01.487 --> 00:57:03.040
I’ll lose him forever.

00:57:04.537 --> 00:57:05.890
Are you sure

00:57:06.248 --> 00:57:07.339
he’s just your younger brother?

00:57:10.805 --> 00:57:11.973
Why are you asking that?

00:57:16.311 --> 00:57:17.902
He seem really important to you.

00:57:21.379 --> 00:57:23.936
He's just my younger brother.

00:57:24.878 --> 00:57:26.368
I’ve taken care of him since we were little.

00:57:26.531 --> 00:57:29.160
So you think it’s your responsibility?

00:57:29.884 --> 00:57:30.669
Yeah.

00:57:38.666 --> 00:57:39.594
Fah.

00:57:40.125 --> 00:57:41.525
About what you asked me,

00:57:41.903 --> 00:57:43.333
whether there’s something wrong with you,

00:57:44.610 --> 00:57:45.602
for me,

00:57:46.142 --> 00:57:47.155
no.

00:57:49.625 --> 00:57:51.520
I believe you’ve done your best.

00:57:54.131 --> 00:57:55.294
You’re always taking care of others.

00:57:56.497 --> 00:57:57.794
Try caring about yourself too.

00:58:02.266 --> 00:58:03.170
Thanks, Hill.

00:58:06.995 --> 00:58:08.310
Right now, even I

00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:11.804
am starting to feel exhausted too.

00:59:10.568 --> 00:59:11.423
Dad.

00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:14.468
I don't want to do this anymore.

00:59:16.964 --> 00:59:18.377
I don't want to hurt P'Fah.

00:59:21.434 --> 00:59:24.128
If you don’t want to do it, then don’t show your face to me again.

00:59:31.891 --> 00:59:33.736
But P'Fah must hate me already.

00:59:34.754 --> 00:59:36.194
That’s even better then.

00:59:36.955 --> 00:59:39.885
So who are you going to choose—Tonfah or your father?

00:59:47.543 --> 00:59:48.696
Dad.

00:59:55.402 --> 00:59:57.128
Can Phoon ask for a chance?

00:59:59.091 --> 01:00:00.897
Just to see him one more time.

01:00:01.903 --> 01:00:03.945
Are you sure that will be the last time?

01:00:14.811 --> 01:00:16.192
Yes, I’m sure.

01:00:18.465 --> 01:00:19.465
And after that,

01:00:31.133 --> 01:00:33.247
I will never get involved with P' Fah again.

01:01:13.197 --> 01:01:13.973
Phoon.

01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:18.198
Have you been waiting long?

01:01:20.293 --> 01:01:21.202
Not long at all.

01:01:25.071 --> 01:01:26.146
Are you feeling unwell?

01:01:28.321 --> 01:01:29.405
I’m fine.

01:01:34.601 --> 01:01:35.722
You feel warm.

01:01:36.121 --> 01:01:37.869
Why didn’t you tell P'Fah if you weren’t feeling well?

01:01:40.625 --> 01:01:41.577
It’s okay.

01:01:46.466 --> 01:01:49.183
I don’t know when I might have hurt you unintentionally.

01:01:49.684 --> 01:01:53.884
If there’s anything you don’t like, can you tell me?

01:01:54.488 --> 01:01:56.020
I’ll try to improve myself.

01:02:00.635 --> 01:02:01.971
It’s really okay.

01:02:03.213 --> 01:02:04.742
You’re fine just the way you are.

01:02:08.687 --> 01:02:12.370
Then eat well, okay? After that, you can take your medicine.

01:02:25.395 --> 01:02:27.017
Stay over in P'Fah’s room tonight.

01:02:30.706 --> 01:02:33.842
With you being sick like this, I can’t leave you alone.

01:02:34.817 --> 01:02:37.761
Or should P'Fah stay in your room instead?

01:02:41.770 --> 01:02:43.377
Your room is fine.

01:02:45.037 --> 01:02:45.968
Okay.

01:03:16.262 --> 01:03:17.063
Here’s your medicine.

01:03:31.988 --> 01:03:32.955
Phoon.

01:03:33.272 --> 01:03:34.828
You seem to really like this chair.

01:03:39.722 --> 01:03:41.502
It can see the sky outside the window.

01:03:42.962 --> 01:03:44.471
It feels really relaxing.

01:03:59.888 --> 01:04:01.364
You’re still warm.

01:04:01.841 --> 01:04:02.988
Want to lie down and rest?

01:04:13.081 --> 01:04:14.905
I’ll sit here and read beside you.

01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:17.074
If you’re not okay, call me.

01:04:17.937 --> 01:04:18.909
Okay.

01:04:33.075 --> 01:04:34.891
This might be the last time

01:04:35.531 --> 01:04:37.585
that I get to be with P'Fah like this.

01:05:12.232 --> 01:05:13.632
The last time.

01:05:14.226 --> 01:05:15.856
The last time I wish would never come.

01:05:39.697 --> 01:05:41.198
Goodbye.

01:06:33.638 --> 01:06:34.580
P'Fah.

01:06:40.722 --> 01:06:41.684
Phoon.

01:06:42.688 --> 01:06:43.635
Phoon.

01:06:43.949 --> 01:06:45.161
You’re inside, right?

01:06:45.493 --> 01:06:47.114
Come out and see me for a bit.

01:06:48.248 --> 01:06:49.121
Phoon.

01:06:50.503 --> 01:06:51.782
Are you okay?

01:06:51.986 --> 01:06:53.365
Come out and talk to me, please.

01:06:54.644 --> 01:06:55.562
Phoon.

01:06:59.837 --> 01:07:00.681
Phoon.

01:07:01.462 --> 01:07:03.386
I know you’re inside.

01:07:03.511 --> 01:07:05.019
Aren’t you going to answer me?

01:07:09.776 --> 01:07:11.188
Do you hate me now?

01:07:16.216 --> 01:07:19.045
I really don’t know what I did wrong.

01:07:20.441 --> 01:07:22.032
But can you tell me,

01:07:22.291 --> 01:07:23.768
what I did wrong?

01:07:31.351 --> 01:07:33.413
You’re my important little brother.

01:07:35.122 --> 01:07:36.915
Can we go back to how things were?

01:07:50.931 --> 01:07:52.035
Get out.

01:07:54.685 --> 01:07:56.282
What nonsense are you rambling on about?

01:07:57.488 --> 01:07:58.743
It’s annoying.

01:08:00.377 --> 01:08:01.358
Do you realize,

01:08:01.859 --> 01:08:04.109
how damn annoying you are?

01:08:04.691 --> 01:08:06.302
And get away from my door.

01:08:06.997 --> 01:08:08.020
Go wherever you want.

01:08:17.435 --> 01:08:18.601
I’m sorry.

01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:20.622
I’ll go now.

01:08:48.856 --> 01:08:50.217
I’m sorry.

01:08:55.214 --> 01:08:56.783
I’m really sorry.

01:09:11.385 --> 01:09:13.755
I never wanted this to happen.

01:09:24.994 --> 01:09:27.234
It’s been sent ever since you were little.

01:09:27.391 --> 01:09:30.562
Since you were one year old, every March.

01:09:30.816 --> 01:09:32.002
Your birthday month.

01:09:32.152 --> 01:09:33.296
Mom?

01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:34.688
There's something?

01:09:34.948 --> 01:09:36.420
If you want to know, transfer the money first.

01:09:36.647 --> 01:09:37.644
Go get it at home.

01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:41.465
I’ve got an idea—how to get Maew to talk to P'Fah.

01:09:41.601 --> 01:09:43.625
- Why chocolate milk?
- Because I like it.

01:09:43.776 --> 01:09:44.728
We could just buy everything, you know.

01:09:44.801 --> 01:09:46.610
Wow, someone’s generous.

01:09:46.709 --> 01:09:48.296
I don’t think P'Fah likes that.

01:09:50.962 --> 01:09:53.063
Look at Fah—so possessive.
