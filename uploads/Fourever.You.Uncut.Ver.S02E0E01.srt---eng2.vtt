00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:12.451


00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.917
The sea doesn’t look beautiful today.

00:00:18.597 --> 00:00:21.619
But whether the sea is beautiful or not doesn’t really matter.

00:00:22.515 --> 00:00:24.062
Because for me,

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.157
it’s the same every single day.

00:00:32.336 --> 00:00:34.112
But the sky—

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.671
it’s never the same even for one day.

00:00:37.825 --> 00:00:39.866
Yet it’s still just as mesmerizing.

00:00:41.522 --> 00:00:43.808
I wonder if you’re looking at the same sky too.

00:00:54.952 --> 00:00:57.854
When I was a kid, whenever something upset me,

00:00:58.088 --> 00:01:00.308
I always came here to hide.

00:01:01.087 --> 00:01:04.814
This place was our secret base.

00:01:16.973 --> 00:01:18.703
Phoon… Phoon.

00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:19.961
Phoon.

00:01:20.991 --> 00:01:22.657
Fah is here now.

00:01:24.936 --> 00:01:27.724
He was the only one I wished would find me.

00:01:34.247 --> 00:01:35.241
Phoon.

00:01:36.645 --> 00:01:38.047
Fah is here.

00:01:39.303 --> 00:01:40.863
P'Fah.

00:01:40.976 --> 00:01:42.837
And he always managed to find me.

00:01:45.585 --> 00:01:47.297
- It’s okay, Phoon.
- P'Fah.

00:01:47.518 --> 00:01:49.602
It’s okay. I'm right here.

00:01:50.262 --> 00:01:53.100
- P'Fah.
- You don’t have to be scared, Phoon.

00:01:54.554 --> 00:01:56.262
P'Fah.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.282
Where have you been? Are you hurt anywhere?

00:02:33.312 --> 00:02:34.562
Mom and Dad aren’t back yet.

00:02:34.677 --> 00:02:35.854
Don’t be scared.

00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:37.462
I won’t tell Mom and Dad.

00:02:37.586 --> 00:02:39.773
that you sneaked out to play.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.330
- Really?
- Of course.

00:02:43.527 --> 00:02:45.650
Thank you, Fah, for bringing Phoon home.

00:02:46.171 --> 00:02:47.274
Then I’ll head back now.

00:02:47.405 --> 00:02:50.020
Otherwise Mom and Dad will know we snuck out late.

00:02:50.291 --> 00:02:52.871
- I’ll get scolded again.
- Okay. Bye-bye.

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:55.949
Come on. Go inside.

00:03:24.477 --> 00:03:26.856
I thought we’d get to attend the same high school again.

00:03:27.506 --> 00:03:28.613
What a shame.

00:03:28.853 --> 00:03:31.216
Then who’s going to tutor me and Phoon?

00:03:31.785 --> 00:03:33.684
Fun and Phoon are already good students.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.854
I will study hard.

00:03:36.124 --> 00:03:37.515
I’ll get into medical school.

00:03:37.777 --> 00:03:39.278
And become a doctor like you, Fah.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:40.835
I’ll work hard too.

00:03:41.188 --> 00:03:42.368
Let’s become doctors together.

00:03:42.897 --> 00:03:45.407
Don’t forget us once you have new neighbors, okay?

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.435
Aww. I won’t forget you.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.441
Phoon.

00:03:53.731 --> 00:03:55.567
We probably won’t see each other for a long time.

00:03:55.854 --> 00:03:57.016
Take good care of yourself.

00:03:59.019 --> 00:03:59.524
Yes.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.201
Alright, kids. Come take a photo.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.100
Come on, stand a bit closer.

00:04:16.054 --> 00:04:19.225
Alright then. One, two, three.

00:04:19.838 --> 00:04:21.017
Switch places.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.210
Switch left and right, quickly.

00:04:26.014 --> 00:04:28.805
One, two, three.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.520
One, two, three.

00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:03.465
Ms. Theerapa Chaowakornkul
Born: 13 September 1996
Died: 10 October 2013

00:05:03.475 --> 00:05:04.675
Phoon came to say goodbye.

00:05:08.573 --> 00:05:10.038
Goodbye, Fun.

00:05:29.303 --> 00:05:30.225
Yes, Uncle Kong.

00:05:30.616 --> 00:05:32.148
Why are you leaving so early?

00:05:32.546 --> 00:05:34.074
Isn’t your flight this afternoon?

00:05:35.257 --> 00:05:36.878
I stopped by to see Fun first.

00:05:37.186 --> 00:05:38.152
Why didn’t you tell me?

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.374
I could’ve taken you to the airport.

00:05:39.514 --> 00:05:41.589
Don’t you have to help my dad with work, Uncle?

00:05:42.183 --> 00:05:43.503
I didn’t want to bother you.

00:05:43.776 --> 00:05:45.413
Bother me? Not at all.

00:05:46.004 --> 00:05:48.576
Are you sure you can go to the airport by yourself?

00:05:50.322 --> 00:05:51.186
Yes, I can.

00:05:51.896 --> 00:05:55.299
I’ll send the rest of your things after you later.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:56.980
If you need anything, let me know.

00:05:57.194 --> 00:06:01.531
You’re going all the way to Chiang Mai alone. I can’t help but worry.

00:06:04.837 --> 00:06:05.912
Thank you.

00:06:06.472 --> 00:06:08.143
Have a safe trip.

00:06:10.142 --> 00:06:10.632
Yes.

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:20.557
Fun.

00:06:21.832 --> 00:06:23.666
Phoon is about to go see P'Fah now.

00:09:49.841 --> 00:09:51.841
To: Torfun

00:09:52.863 --> 00:09:54.662
I’ve arrived in Chiang Mai.

00:09:55.016 --> 00:09:56.453
I just got to the dorm.

00:09:56.837 --> 00:09:58.745
The semester is about to start.

00:09:59.121 --> 00:10:01.336
I really feel guilty toward you, Fun.

00:10:01.671 --> 00:10:05.542
For failing the medical school entrance exam, even though I tried so hard.

00:10:05.764 --> 00:10:07.721
I wanted to become a doctor for you.

00:10:08.254 --> 00:10:10.065
But next year, I’ll definitely make it.

00:10:20.343 --> 00:10:21.951
The weather is nice today.

00:10:22.361 --> 00:10:26.914
I’m thinking of going out to take some photos.
Please wish me luck so I don’t get lost again.

00:10:44.921 --> 00:10:46.305
Lost again?

00:10:54.423 --> 00:10:55.426
Excuse me.

00:10:57.971 --> 00:10:59.884
How do I get back to the university?

00:11:00.226 --> 00:11:01.921
I’m not going that way.

00:11:02.216 --> 00:11:03.346
That’s a different direction.

00:11:03.995 --> 00:11:05.700
Then where are you going?

00:11:05.884 --> 00:11:08.234
I’m heading to Tha Phae Walking Street. Someone called me to pick them up.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:11.823
The walking street?

00:11:14.087 --> 00:11:14.783
Yes.

00:11:15.016 --> 00:11:16.506
Then hop in.

00:12:17.192 --> 00:12:17.754
Oops.

00:12:19.291 --> 00:12:20.207
Sorry.

00:12:26.601 --> 00:12:27.749
Phoon.

00:12:30.222 --> 00:12:31.564
Do you remember me, Fah?

00:12:38.349 --> 00:12:38.970
Yes.

00:12:41.417 --> 00:12:44.241
It’s been so long. Almost four years, right?

00:12:44.736 --> 00:12:46.795
How have you been, Phoon? Are you doing okay?

00:12:49.745 --> 00:12:50.848
I’m doing fine.

00:12:51.626 --> 00:12:52.351
Really?

00:12:52.576 --> 00:12:53.998
What are you doing here all by yourself?

00:12:58.368 --> 00:13:00.881
Oh—Tonfah. It’s been a long time.

00:13:01.222 --> 00:13:03.429
I’m doing well. How about you?

00:13:03.597 --> 00:13:06.389
We’re doing fine too. Are you here alone?

00:13:06.758 --> 00:13:08.894
Yeah, but I’m heading back soon.

00:13:14.472 --> 00:13:16.920
Phoon. Phoon.

00:13:18.152 --> 00:13:19.798
Phoon. Phoon.

00:13:20.955 --> 00:13:21.933
Phoon.

00:13:27.598 --> 00:13:28.757
P'Fah.

00:13:39.792 --> 00:13:43.546
I saw this little guy running around in the rain by the roadside,

00:13:44.275 --> 00:13:46.887
so you followed it and ended up getting lost here, right?

00:13:52.475 --> 00:13:53.210
Yes.

00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:57.195
I’m sorry for causing you trouble again, P'Fah.

00:13:58.346 --> 00:13:59.576
It’s not a problem.

00:14:03.477 --> 00:14:05.010
What did I tell you?

00:14:05.459 --> 00:14:08.117
If you get lost, just sit and wait.

00:14:08.339 --> 00:14:10.211
I’ll come find you myself.

00:14:23.102 --> 00:14:24.425
I found you.

00:14:45.877 --> 00:14:47.407
So you’re actually studying here?

00:14:47.885 --> 00:14:49.485
I thought you were just here on vacation.

00:14:49.709 --> 00:14:52.339
The semester doesn’t even start for another two months.

00:14:54.964 --> 00:14:57.035
I just wanted to try living here first.

00:14:58.281 --> 00:15:00.240
There’s still a lot I need to adjust to.

00:15:01.404 --> 00:15:04.662
What made you decide to come study so far away by yourself?

00:15:05.785 --> 00:15:06.795
Well…

00:15:07.288 --> 00:15:08.968
I just wanted to give it a try.

00:15:11.967 --> 00:15:13.211
What faculty are you in?

00:15:14.244 --> 00:15:15.521
Veterinary Medicine.

00:15:18.586 --> 00:15:20.891
I thought you wouldn’t like that field.

00:15:22.157 --> 00:15:25.164
No, I actually like it quite a bit.

00:15:27.678 --> 00:15:28.531
And…

00:15:28.619 --> 00:15:30.450
You’re studying medicine, right?

00:15:31.165 --> 00:15:31.922
Yeah.

00:15:37.794 --> 00:15:38.682
Thank you.

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.354
I really thought I’d never see you again, Phoon.

00:15:49.518 --> 00:15:50.628
Yeah…

00:15:53.696 --> 00:15:54.408
Oh—

00:15:54.718 --> 00:15:56.044
So you came here alone?

00:15:56.139 --> 00:15:57.370
Did you come with any friends?

00:15:59.345 --> 00:16:00.122
I came by myself.

00:16:00.657 --> 00:16:01.445
Really?

00:16:01.911 --> 00:16:02.776
That’s impressive.

00:16:10.727 --> 00:16:12.280
You haven’t changed much at all, Phoon.

00:16:13.272 --> 00:16:14.748
You look just the same.

00:16:16.417 --> 00:16:17.945
It really brings back memories of when we were kids.

00:16:18.162 --> 00:16:19.182
Back then,

00:16:19.948 --> 00:16:21.357
we were always together.

00:16:22.114 --> 00:16:23.509
You, me, and Fun too.

00:16:29.589 --> 00:16:32.389
By the way, how’s your dad doing?

00:16:32.811 --> 00:16:36.158
I haven’t heard anything since you moved out.

00:16:39.588 --> 00:16:41.322
He’s doing fine.

00:16:42.124 --> 00:16:44.408
- Mm.
- My mom...

00:16:46.617 --> 00:16:48.853
I don’t really know how she’s doing.

00:16:52.757 --> 00:16:53.874
What do you mean?

00:16:58.266 --> 00:16:59.814
My parents divorced.

00:17:00.598 --> 00:17:02.106
My mom moved out after that.

00:17:05.131 --> 00:17:06.619
I’m sorry, Phoon.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:08.081
Are you okay?

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.438
How’s Fun doing?

00:17:24.537 --> 00:17:26.151
Fun’s doing fine.

00:18:09.105 --> 00:18:10.767
Thanks for driving me back.

00:18:11.189 --> 00:18:12.805
Drive safely.

00:18:13.059 --> 00:18:14.592
Okay. See you.

00:18:15.028 --> 00:18:15.622
Yeah.

00:19:14.912 --> 00:19:15.727
To: Torfun

00:19:45.281 --> 00:19:47.142
Dear Torfun,

00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:50.481
I ran into P'Fah today by chance.

00:19:50.939 --> 00:19:52.152
I was really shocked.

00:19:52.697 --> 00:19:54.106
I didn’t know what to do.

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:57.216
There were so many things I wanted to say to him,

00:19:57.386 --> 00:20:00.554
but when it came down to it, I could barely speak.

00:20:00.988 --> 00:20:03.462
He looked happy to see me.

00:20:04.309 --> 00:20:05.945
He even asked about you.

00:20:06.253 --> 00:20:07.924
And I ended up lying,

00:20:08.237 --> 00:20:10.875
saying you were doing fine.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.693
I’m sorry I lied to him like that.

00:20:35.391 --> 00:20:38.051
I was afraid that if he knew the truth,

00:20:38.614 --> 00:20:40.848
he’d be disappointed in me.

00:20:41.934 --> 00:20:46.314
He might get angry, just like Mom and Dad did.

00:20:47.242 --> 00:20:49.229
You’re not here anymore,

00:20:49.871 --> 00:20:52.271
and if P'Fah isn’t by my side either,

00:20:52.928 --> 00:20:54.586
who would I have left?

00:21:27.162 --> 00:21:28.512
You lied to me, didn’t you?

00:21:30.282 --> 00:21:32.408
- No, I didn’t.
- I already know about Fun.

00:21:33.294 --> 00:21:36.922
This is really bad—what you did, and lying to me too.

00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:40.349
Is there anything else you’re lying to me about?

00:21:41.567 --> 00:21:42.431
Huh?

00:21:46.354 --> 00:21:48.373
I’m seriously disappointed in you, Phoon.

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:52.524
You hurt everyone, especially Fun.

00:21:52.666 --> 00:21:55.441
If you hadn’t done that back then, Fun wouldn’t have died.

00:21:55.552 --> 00:21:57.413
Do you even realize you’re the one at fault?

00:21:58.447 --> 00:21:59.136
Yes.

00:22:02.435 --> 00:22:03.565
Another thing—

00:22:04.266 --> 00:22:05.951
I hate liars.

00:22:06.807 --> 00:22:09.496
And I can’t forgive people who keep hurting others.

00:22:10.871 --> 00:22:12.454
It’d be better if we never see each other again.

00:22:14.484 --> 00:22:16.527
P'Fah, I’m sorry.

00:22:16.552 --> 00:22:18.528
- Let go.
- P'Fah.

00:22:18.641 --> 00:22:20.823
P'Fah, I’m sorry.

00:22:20.903 --> 00:22:22.721
P'Fah.

00:22:23.314 --> 00:22:25.419
P'Fah, I’m sorry.

00:22:25.949 --> 00:22:31.120
P'Fah, please don’t leave me.

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.653
Please don’t leave me, P'Fah.

00:22:48.891 --> 00:22:49.946
Thank you.

00:23:01.625 --> 00:23:03.226
Two pork skewers and one sticky rice, please.

00:23:03.475 --> 00:23:05.611
Alright, dear. Why are you eating so little?

00:23:08.745 --> 00:23:09.728
Are you feeling sick?

00:23:10.192 --> 00:23:11.727
You look a bit pale.

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:14.334
No.

00:23:15.875 --> 00:23:16.493
Here you go.

00:23:16.577 --> 00:23:18.373
- How much is it?
- 20 baht.

00:23:21.622 --> 00:23:22.564
Thank you.

00:26:16.817 --> 00:26:18.640
My battery’s about to die.

00:26:40.845 --> 00:26:42.690
- Come here. Now.
- Ow!

00:26:42.842 --> 00:26:44.257
I told you to come here!

00:26:44.714 --> 00:26:46.539
Get in. Go inside.

00:26:46.703 --> 00:26:48.623
Do you even know what you’ve done?

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:53.011
How many times have I told you not to go into my office?

00:26:53.125 --> 00:26:57.588
Do you know that the vase you broke is worth more than your life?

00:26:57.797 --> 00:26:59.142
Get that through your head.

00:26:59.336 --> 00:27:01.602
Stay in here. Don’t go anywhere.

00:27:02.794 --> 00:27:04.336
Dad… Dad…

00:27:04.377 --> 00:27:06.413
- Stop crying.
- Dad, I’m sorry.

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:10.509
Dad, I’m sorry. I won’t do it again.

00:27:10.605 --> 00:27:12.354
- Don’t call me.
- Dad…

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.312
You little bastard. Shut up.

00:27:15.314 --> 00:27:18.816
P'Fah! Fun! Someone, please help me!

00:27:19.388 --> 00:27:22.142
- Phoon, are you inside?
- P'Fah, please help me.

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:25.450
It’s so dark. I’m scared, P'Fah.

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:27.237
Easy, Phoon.

00:27:27.259 --> 00:27:29.441
It’s really dark in there.

00:27:30.242 --> 00:27:31.654
Reach your hand out.

00:27:33.131 --> 00:27:36.740
Don’t be scared. I’ll stay with you until Uncle Kong comes back.

00:27:37.271 --> 00:27:39.459
Don’t go anywhere, P'Fah.

00:27:58.877 --> 00:28:01.257
Hello, P'Fah. Is this a good time to talk?

00:28:01.925 --> 00:28:03.167
Is something wrong?

00:28:04.874 --> 00:28:07.282
Uh… it’s just that at my dorm—

00:28:07.791 --> 00:28:08.887
the power went out.

00:28:09.697 --> 00:28:11.512
My phone battery’s almost dead too.

00:28:12.792 --> 00:28:14.345
Are you still afraid of the dark?

00:28:18.195 --> 00:28:19.050
I am.

00:28:20.924 --> 00:28:22.309
What room are you in?

00:28:24.887 --> 00:28:26.731
Room 302.

00:28:27.268 --> 00:28:31.890
I’ll get there before your phone dies,
so don’t hang up until we meet, okay?

00:28:32.488 --> 00:28:34.240
Okay.

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:03.771
Phoon?

00:29:06.004 --> 00:29:07.678
Phoon, are you okay?

00:29:13.757 --> 00:29:18.779
I asked the security guard downstairs.
He said the power will likely be out until morning.

00:29:22.656 --> 00:29:25.429
Then why don’t you stay over at my place tonight?

00:29:29.795 --> 00:29:31.170
Would that be okay?

00:29:32.888 --> 00:29:34.087
There’s no other choice.

00:29:34.342 --> 00:29:35.622
You don’t have to feel awkward about it.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.223
Let’s go.

00:29:44.835 --> 00:29:45.727
Careful.

00:30:21.505 --> 00:30:22.435
Let’s go.

00:30:41.887 --> 00:30:44.602
It’s not as dark here. Do you feel better?

00:30:46.838 --> 00:30:47.574
Yes.

00:30:54.205 --> 00:30:55.248
Do you want to wipe your sweat?

00:30:57.263 --> 00:31:00.060
Thank you.

00:31:34.045 --> 00:31:35.081
Make yourself at home.

00:31:36.471 --> 00:31:37.250
Okay.

00:31:38.602 --> 00:31:40.285
Are you sleepy? Want to go to bed now?

00:31:42.293 --> 00:31:43.588
I can sleep now.

00:31:44.983 --> 00:31:46.518
Then go sleep in the bedroom.

00:31:46.768 --> 00:31:49.696
Um… I can sleep on the couch.

00:31:50.028 --> 00:31:51.198
You should sleep in the bedroom.

00:31:51.405 --> 00:31:52.737
I’ll sleep outside.

00:31:55.142 --> 00:31:55.771
Come on.

00:32:11.579 --> 00:32:12.416
Here.

00:32:12.783 --> 00:32:15.401
I’m not sure if it’ll fit you, though.

00:32:15.555 --> 00:32:16.512
Try it on.

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:19.728
Thank you.

00:32:21.097 --> 00:32:23.419
If you need anything, just call me.

00:32:25.822 --> 00:32:27.162
Actually—

00:32:27.626 --> 00:32:29.462
I really can sleep on the couch.

00:32:31.103 --> 00:32:32.377
I don’t want to bother you.

00:32:35.502 --> 00:32:38.137
It’s fine. The bed’s more comfortable.

00:32:39.811 --> 00:32:41.290
Then—

00:32:42.795 --> 00:32:46.936
We could sleep in the same room.

00:32:48.185 --> 00:32:49.237
It’s okay.

00:32:49.589 --> 00:32:51.097
You sleeping there is better.

00:32:53.875 --> 00:32:54.931
Good night.

00:32:55.625 --> 00:32:56.284
Um—

00:32:56.917 --> 00:32:57.968
Good night.

00:32:59.037 --> 00:33:00.672
- P'Fah.
- Yeah?

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:03.580
Thank you.

00:33:04.493 --> 00:33:05.214
Yeah.

00:33:43.484 --> 00:33:46.287
Sorry. I was just grabbing a book.

00:33:46.474 --> 00:33:47.807
I ended up waking you.

00:33:53.802 --> 00:33:55.681
It’s okay. I wasn’t asleep yet.

00:33:56.457 --> 00:33:57.844
Is the bed uncomfortable?

00:33:58.761 --> 00:33:59.640
No.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:08.120
Sleeping with the light on makes it harder to sleep deeply.

00:34:08.536 --> 00:34:09.755
Want to try turning it off?

00:34:11.022 --> 00:34:12.105
I don’t think that’s a good idea.

00:34:12.445 --> 00:34:13.422
Why not?

00:34:13.734 --> 00:34:17.508
Maybe it’ll help your fear of the dark too.

00:34:19.322 --> 00:34:21.130
I’ve tried before, but—

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:23.859
I really can’t.

00:34:29.776 --> 00:34:32.829
Then I’ll stay with you. Try your best.

00:34:33.505 --> 00:34:34.518
If you’re scared—

00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:36.226
you can hold my hand

00:35:03.927 --> 00:35:06.557
You’ll stay with me until I fall asleep, right?

00:35:07.398 --> 00:35:08.214
Yes.

00:35:08.508 --> 00:35:11.562
Once you’re asleep, I’ll go sleep outside.

00:35:15.056 --> 00:35:16.740
- P'Fah.
- Yes?

00:35:18.336 --> 00:35:19.597
Good night.

00:35:21.125 --> 00:35:22.428
Good night.

00:36:12.288 --> 00:36:13.429
You’re awake?

00:36:15.745 --> 00:36:17.428
Sorry I woke up late.

00:36:18.047 --> 00:36:19.425
It’s okay.

00:36:23.958 --> 00:36:24.720
Mm.

00:36:25.444 --> 00:36:28.103
Go shower and get dressed. We’ll grab something to eat.

00:36:29.253 --> 00:36:30.331
Thank you.

00:36:34.284 --> 00:36:35.616
Hey, Phoon.

00:36:37.388 --> 00:36:39.155
Can I get Fun’s LINE ID?

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:45.068
We haven’t talked in a long time. I want to know how she’s doing.

00:36:47.613 --> 00:36:48.761
Uh—

00:36:49.226 --> 00:36:50.280
Wait a sec.

00:36:50.589 --> 00:36:51.718
I’ll send it to you.

00:36:52.774 --> 00:36:53.607
Okay.

00:37:25.201 --> 00:37:26.965
So Fun’s studying medicine near home?

00:37:32.133 --> 00:37:33.122
Yeah.

00:37:34.345 --> 00:37:37.805
That’s surprising. Why did Fun let you study here alone?

00:37:42.272 --> 00:37:45.125
I insisted on coming by myself.

00:37:47.597 --> 00:37:49.445
She didn’t even come to drop you off?

00:37:50.299 --> 00:37:52.456
Did something happen while I was away?

00:37:53.066 --> 00:37:54.379
Did you fight?

00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:57.379
No, nothing like that.

00:37:58.272 --> 00:38:00.648
She thinks I’m grown up now, so—

00:38:00.902 --> 00:38:02.213
she doesn’t worry as much anymore.

00:38:02.362 --> 00:38:03.114
I see.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:05.272
Yeah.

00:38:11.705 --> 00:38:12.682
P'Fah.

00:38:13.019 --> 00:38:13.765
Yeah?

00:38:14.511 --> 00:38:17.134
You haven’t heard anything from my family?

00:38:17.336 --> 00:38:18.060
No.

00:38:19.398 --> 00:38:21.040
Why do you ask?

00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:25.485
Nothing.

00:38:25.607 --> 00:38:26.696
- Oh.
- I thought—

00:38:26.819 --> 00:38:28.918
your mom and dad were still in touch with my dad.

00:38:30.882 --> 00:38:33.398
My parents hardly ever talk about your dad.

00:38:34.103 --> 00:38:36.081
It’s like he disappeared.

00:38:36.939 --> 00:38:38.268
So I thought—

00:38:38.438 --> 00:38:40.222
I’d never see you or Fun again.

00:38:46.568 --> 00:38:49.160
Will you ever go back to Phuket?

00:38:49.982 --> 00:38:51.077
Probably not.

00:38:51.282 --> 00:38:52.954
The old house was sold.

00:38:57.802 --> 00:39:00.109
If we hadn’t met here—

00:39:00.798 --> 00:39:02.493
we might never have met again, right?

00:39:03.948 --> 00:39:05.522
But we did meet.

00:39:05.819 --> 00:39:06.752
What a coincidence.

00:39:07.028 --> 00:39:08.669
Out of so many universities—

00:39:08.848 --> 00:39:09.800
you—

00:39:09.856 --> 00:39:11.765
ended up choosing the same one as me.

00:39:13.749 --> 00:39:14.746
Yeah, I guess so.

00:40:00.423 --> 00:40:02.554
Fun, it’s Fah.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.401
I ran into Phoon today. He’s studying at the same university as me.

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:19.188
Really?

00:40:25.808 --> 00:40:27.605
Is something going on at home?

00:40:31.866 --> 00:40:33.583
Why would you ask that?

00:40:39.352 --> 00:40:41.797
Phoon seems different. Different enough to worry me.

00:40:41.924 --> 00:40:44.998
Maybe I’m just overthinking it.

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:52.562
No. He’s still the same Phoon.

00:41:10.285 --> 00:41:12.571
Are you free tomorrow? Let’s go out.

00:41:40.431 --> 00:41:41.629
You look tired.

00:41:41.853 --> 00:41:43.103
Did you have trouble sleeping again?

00:41:44.971 --> 00:41:46.254
Well—

00:41:47.401 --> 00:41:48.051
yeah.

00:41:51.939 --> 00:41:54.780
Did you sleep well the night you stayed over?

00:41:56.497 --> 00:41:57.865
I did.

00:41:58.671 --> 00:41:59.472
Then—

00:41:59.743 --> 00:42:00.961
if you can’t sleep again,

00:42:01.324 --> 00:42:02.831
you can stay over again.

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.971
How long has the insomnia been going on?

00:42:15.207 --> 00:42:16.411
For a long time.

00:42:18.062 --> 00:42:19.294
Have you seen a doctor?

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:21.694
I have.

00:42:23.065 --> 00:42:24.348
Did it help at all?

00:42:26.951 --> 00:42:28.106
Not really.

00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:33.607
Have you talked to anyone about your fear of the dark or enclosed spaces?

00:42:33.811 --> 00:42:35.266
I think they might be related.

00:42:36.125 --> 00:42:38.299
No, I haven’t.

00:42:38.903 --> 00:42:41.419
Then let’s go. I’ll take you.

00:42:42.183 --> 00:42:43.988
It’s okay.

00:42:49.743 --> 00:42:52.020
Have you eaten yet?

00:42:53.607 --> 00:42:55.690
I have.

00:43:00.077 --> 00:43:01.432
Don’t lie to me.

00:43:01.745 --> 00:43:02.893
You haven’t eaten, right?

00:43:08.201 --> 00:43:08.893
Right.

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:24.272
Do you usually eat this little?

00:43:30.444 --> 00:43:31.474
Are you sick?

00:43:33.725 --> 00:43:34.491
No.

00:43:38.128 --> 00:43:40.195
I think we should make a deal.

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:45.277
You finish your meal, and I’ll take you out.

00:43:45.435 --> 00:43:46.047
Deal?

00:43:46.422 --> 00:43:47.382
Why?

00:43:47.671 --> 00:43:49.752
To fix a kid’s bad habit of not eating properly.

00:43:51.151 --> 00:43:54.161
- But—
- I’m not taking you out for free.

00:43:54.254 --> 00:43:55.625
Let’s call it a fair exchange.

00:43:55.776 --> 00:43:57.392
Then you don’t get anything out of it.

00:43:57.967 --> 00:43:59.645
So, do we have a deal?

00:44:04.223 --> 00:44:05.257
Alright.

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:09.986
Finish it quickly so we can go out.

00:44:34.164 --> 00:44:35.764
Why are you making that face?

00:44:36.677 --> 00:44:37.853
I’m full.

00:44:39.962 --> 00:44:41.733
The view here is really beautiful.

00:44:42.074 --> 00:44:44.604
Totally worth finishing your meal.

00:44:50.004 --> 00:44:51.877
Let’s go pay respect at the Buddha first.

00:44:52.653 --> 00:44:53.328
Shall we?

00:45:36.939 --> 00:45:38.776
Why do you like taking photos of the sky?

00:45:40.411 --> 00:45:42.257
Because it’s beautiful.

00:45:42.962 --> 00:45:44.162
Hmm?

00:45:58.037 --> 00:45:58.951
P'Fah.

00:46:00.508 --> 00:46:02.134
Wanna play a game?

00:46:02.635 --> 00:46:03.505
What kind of game?

00:46:05.903 --> 00:46:09.320
We take turns asking one question each.

00:46:09.882 --> 00:46:11.783
And if it’s a question you don’t want to answer?

00:46:13.444 --> 00:46:14.521
Well—

00:46:15.837 --> 00:46:16.965
Well—

00:46:17.348 --> 00:46:19.091
Then you don’t have to answer.

00:46:19.364 --> 00:46:20.451
Just kidding.

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:23.231
Sure. Who goes first?

00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:24.774
Me.

00:46:25.173 --> 00:46:25.859
Mm.

00:46:27.208 --> 00:46:29.401
I want to ask you something, P'Fah.

00:46:33.628 --> 00:46:36.285
While we weren’t seeing each other,

00:46:37.997 --> 00:46:39.782
how have you been?

00:46:41.789 --> 00:46:43.506
That’s more ordinary than I expected.

00:46:45.325 --> 00:46:47.645
I’ve been fine.

00:46:47.918 --> 00:46:49.625
Nothing special.

00:46:50.189 --> 00:46:53.091
Going to classes, reading,

00:46:53.597 --> 00:46:55.109
and tutoring on the side.

00:46:56.311 --> 00:46:57.448
What about you, Phoon?

00:47:02.645 --> 00:47:04.045
Me too.

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:06.989
Nothing special.

00:47:07.582 --> 00:47:08.149
Really.

00:47:10.554 --> 00:47:12.675
How were your high school friends?

00:47:13.379 --> 00:47:15.008
We were close, like normal.

00:47:15.850 --> 00:47:18.715
Studied together, hung out sometimes.

00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:20.266
Nothing out of the ordinary.

00:47:20.742 --> 00:47:22.345
And how about you?

00:47:25.242 --> 00:47:28.179
I’m doing okay.

00:47:28.435 --> 00:47:29.379
Mm.

00:47:32.905 --> 00:47:35.398
What about your friends now?

00:47:36.149 --> 00:47:37.983
My friends now…

00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:42.994
They’re all kind of weird.

00:47:44.681 --> 00:47:46.552
But it’s fun being with them.

00:47:48.364 --> 00:47:50.173
You don’t have friends here yet, right?

00:47:56.968 --> 00:47:58.349
How’s Sri Thong?

00:48:01.515 --> 00:48:03.511
Did you get lost?

00:48:04.906 --> 00:48:05.872
P'Fah.

00:48:06.585 --> 00:48:08.080
Can we keep it?

00:48:11.231 --> 00:48:12.189
I think

00:48:12.371 --> 00:48:14.460
we should find someone else to adopt it.

00:48:15.148 --> 00:48:16.968
But I want to keep it.

00:48:18.951 --> 00:48:20.530
It must be really lonely.

00:48:21.194 --> 00:48:22.776
If it stays with us, it won’t be.

00:48:24.601 --> 00:48:25.765
Are you lonely, Phoon?

00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:27.654
You have everyone.

00:48:28.893 --> 00:48:30.459
My parents aren’t with me,

00:48:31.562 --> 00:48:33.419
and P'Fah and Fun are both busy.

00:48:34.226 --> 00:48:35.158
I think

00:48:35.715 --> 00:48:37.568
your dad wouldn’t allow it.

00:48:42.231 --> 00:48:43.703
Then I’ll take care of it.

00:48:43.853 --> 00:48:46.007
And you can come play with it often, okay?

00:48:46.442 --> 00:48:47.287
Really?

00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:49.478
Thank you.

00:48:52.248 --> 00:48:53.860
What do you want to name it?

00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:00.949
How about “Sri Thong”?

00:49:01.337 --> 00:49:02.968
Mm, that’s nice.

00:49:04.848 --> 00:49:06.416
Sri Thong.

00:49:23.288 --> 00:49:25.060
Sri Thong.

00:49:30.645 --> 00:49:31.597
Oh no.

00:49:39.951 --> 00:49:40.979
I’m sorry.

00:49:41.745 --> 00:49:43.426
Even though you took such good care of it,

00:49:43.659 --> 00:49:44.853
but when it was with me—

00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:46.642
You don’t have to apologize.

00:49:46.888 --> 00:49:49.177
I believe you did your best.

00:49:55.724 --> 00:49:57.168
Now it’s my turn to ask.

00:50:03.588 --> 00:50:04.973
May I ask

00:50:05.573 --> 00:50:07.743
something personal?

00:50:08.235 --> 00:50:08.974
Sure.

00:50:15.771 --> 00:50:17.917
Right now,

00:50:18.823 --> 00:50:21.360
are you dating anyone?

00:50:23.468 --> 00:50:24.971
No, I’m not.

00:50:27.287 --> 00:50:28.170
That’s strange.

00:50:28.703 --> 00:50:30.688
- What about someone you’re talking to?
- No.

00:50:33.358 --> 00:50:34.902
Oh.

00:50:36.651 --> 00:50:37.804
Is that strange?

00:50:38.456 --> 00:50:39.878
For me?

00:50:40.405 --> 00:50:42.174
Love feels very distant to me.

00:50:45.035 --> 00:50:46.035
Why?

00:50:49.613 --> 00:50:52.047
I dated someone back in high school.

00:50:53.256 --> 00:50:55.302
After a while, I realized

00:50:55.791 --> 00:50:57.514
love is complicated.

00:50:59.186 --> 00:51:02.648
And I felt like I couldn’t really handle it.

00:51:05.282 --> 00:51:06.988
So we broke up.

00:51:08.265 --> 00:51:09.768
After that,

00:51:10.174 --> 00:51:12.635
love wasn’t something I was looking for anymore.

00:51:15.805 --> 00:51:17.305
I see.

00:51:22.512 --> 00:51:23.900
They even said

00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:28.051
that I were like their sky.

00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:31.921
I never wanted to be that.

00:51:37.121 --> 00:51:38.142
When it rains,

00:51:38.917 --> 00:51:40.600
the sky isn’t beautiful.

00:51:41.225 --> 00:51:42.696
No one wants to look at it.

00:51:45.417 --> 00:51:48.041
But people expect the sky to be beautiful every day.

00:51:52.450 --> 00:51:53.484
I

00:51:54.263 --> 00:51:55.921
can’t be anyone’s sky.

00:52:01.219 --> 00:52:03.005
Can’t you be

00:52:03.951 --> 00:52:05.321
my sky?

00:52:27.653 --> 00:52:29.968
A friend? What’s his name?

00:52:31.374 --> 00:52:32.568
Johan.

00:52:33.019 --> 00:52:34.954
- Interested?
- No.

00:52:35.365 --> 00:52:36.580
I’m taking the medical exam.

00:52:36.607 --> 00:52:40.915
Could you tutor me, Fah?

00:52:41.334 --> 00:52:46.854
In Mawsynram, India, rainfall reaches over 10,800 millimeters a year—
about nine times more than here.

00:52:47.165 --> 00:52:48.478
The sky looks beautiful today.

00:52:48.668 --> 00:52:51.717
It’s nice that the sky can make you smile this much.

00:52:52.708 --> 00:52:53.595
Phoon,

00:52:54.065 --> 00:52:55.391
keep smiling, okay?
