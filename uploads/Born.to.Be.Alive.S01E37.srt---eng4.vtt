[Born to Be Alive]

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.150
[Episode 37]

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.960
Come back.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.650
Just because you tell me to

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.780
doesn't mean I will.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.140
You...

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.579
Bai Ju told me everything.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:28.620
What did she say?

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:30.470
Something is wrong with

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.110
Hongyuan, Xinhai, and Meng Yaohui.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.120
It's not just illegal mining.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.590
There's a lot more going on with them.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.990
I don't know how to explain it.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.720
I was wrong, okay?

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.410
But your words were hurtful too.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.980
How can you say I have no conscience?

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.990
We've been investigating
and investigating,

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.450
but we still know nothing.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.870
I just got a bit anxious.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.030
Can't I get angry about that?

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.940
Didn't you get angry too?

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.550
When you get angry, that's what's scary.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.590
I only meant

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.240
to lecture you.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:14.660
But what you said

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.560
was much scarier

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:17.600
than my lecture.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:23.970
You're laughing?

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.790
You're still laughing?

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.850
How can you still laugh?

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.960
What a scary reporter.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.140
So, are we good now?

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.350
The Mountain God's steward is watching.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.030
You are...

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.970
Manager Zhao.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.850
You're from the Mountain Patrol.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.680
The Mountain God's steward...

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.560
I've always remembered you all.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.980
You can't mine that mountain.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.030
Why?

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.030
That is the Mountain God's

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.159
third wife.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.250
You see that one over there?

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.280
That's the Mountain God's second wife.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.810
The mountain to the south is

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.409
the Mountain God's steward.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.930
It's you.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.750
You still remember me?

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.420
I didn't expect to meet you again.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:02.560
Yeah.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:06.740
Zhacuo.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.690
You were right.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.230
Those mountains

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.030
can't be mined.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.920
Ding used to tell me

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.720
that his fate

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.810
clashed with the element of earth.

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:32.610
That's why

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.540
he never found any ore.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.450
When I was young,

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.860
I didn't believe in fate.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:38.790
I really didn't.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.930
But it's different now.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.190
After all these years,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.590
my mindset has changed.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.620
I suddenly realized

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.120
that, for every one of us,

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.920
every step we take

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.280
seems somehow

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.050
destined by fate.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.300
Back then,

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.220
if I hadn't gone down that road

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.830
to Bolamula

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.430
to explore for mines...

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:10.940
would everything that followed

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.180
have happened?

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.750
What...

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.050
followed?

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.830
What followed was...

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.220
was everything

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.710
you uncovered during your investigation.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.890
I handed over the company

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.360
and... retired.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.750
Who retires at such a young age?

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:37.630
I'm in poor health.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:40.830
I'm in poor health,

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:42.810
so I had to retire.

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.010
You look pretty healthy to me.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:47.620
You don't even need

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.400
supplemental oxygen anymore.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:51.830
Zhacuo.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.140
Even to this day,

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.790
I can't believe

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.950
we still have the chance

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.620
to have a meal together.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:05.610
After this meal,

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:06.610
you should leave.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:08.510
Don't

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.010
come see me again.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.440
We didn't come here for anything else.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:15.750
If you want,

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.480
next time we can bring along

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.350
other former Mountain Patrol members

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:19.340
to visit you.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.620
Next time...

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.330
I don't dare promise anything

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:30.530
about the future now.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.270
I might not even

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.260
make it to next year.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:45.710
Auntie,

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:46.570
please count it again.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.390
Check whether the money's all there.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:49.020
No.

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:49.960
It's all here.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.600
Bai,

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.220
thank you so much.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.230
You're welcome.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:55.890
What about that man?

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:56.890
Did you catch him?

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:00.510
We caught him,

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.250
but as for visitation...

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:03.620
Good!

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:04.720
People like him

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.950
belong in prison!

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:07.830
If you don't teach him a lesson,

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.470
he'll keep scamming people.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.770
You've thought it through?

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.390
Yeah, I have!

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.250
It's just that I caused too much trouble

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:19.890
for you police officers.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.830
It's fine.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:22.080
Let me show you.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:23.950
This is

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.170
my new boyfriend.

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:26.390
What do you think?

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:27.790
Pretty handsome, right?

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.120
Look.

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:33.610
Auntie,

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:35.830
this photo looks a bit...

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.130
Looks a bit fake.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.049
Don't worry.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:40.150
This time,

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:41.630
I'll just give him my affection.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:42.210
I definitely

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:43.809
won't let him take any money.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:45.950
Besides,

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:47.670
now I have you

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:48.770
by my side, don't I?

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:53.460
Although I'm terrible at

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.340
judging men,

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:56.520
I'm very good at reading women.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.010
I could tell at first glance

00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:59.340
that you're a good girl.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.440
Yaohui, my child,

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:03.430
over the years,

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:04.890
has offended many people.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.100
He's hardly made any real friends,

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.320
and he especially doesn't trust women.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:10.550
But I can feel it.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.730
He treats you differently.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:16.120
Auntie,

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.910
actually, you've misunderstood.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:21.240
Mr. Meng and I...

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:21.840
I...

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:25.800
Let me peel an apple for you.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.620
I'll get a knife.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:27.960
Wait here for a sec.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.220
Don't bother, Auntie!

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:57.700
Yaohui gave me this

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:58.760
as a birthday gift.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:00.460
I was born in the Year of the Ox.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:01.530
He said this elephant

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:03.080
has eyes like an ox.

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:05.430
I can't really tell though.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:08.220
He

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:10.110
seems cold on the outside,

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.000
but he's

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.360
actually warm inside.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.220
He really values relationships.

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:16.960
I'm not trying to set you up.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.410
I just hope that when it really matters,

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:20.220
you can give him a hand

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.130
like a friend.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:22.790
That's all I ask.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:25.650
Auntie,

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:27.120
this elephant's design

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.500
is pretty unique.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.660
Where did he get it?

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:30.600
Guangzhou.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:33.590
Where did you buy this?

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:35.080
I brought it back from my road trip

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.010
to South Asia.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:37.600
Shao, if you like it,

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.260
it's yours.

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:53.740
Meng Yaohui

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.790
really does have a strange taste

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:56.940
in gifts.

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:01.030
He takes after his father—practical.

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:02.770
He didn't inherit

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:05.090
any of my romantic genes.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.220
Being practical is good.

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:09.610
Auntie,

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:10.200
when did he

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.530
give you this elephant?

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:12.670
1997.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.000
My zodiac year.

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:18.830
That year,

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.320
something big did happen.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:22.330
Yaohui had a breakup.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.620
He said he didn't want to
stay in Tianduo anymore

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:25.460
and wanted to go somewhere else

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:26.790
for a change of scenery.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.080
The way he was back then,

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:29.670
I thought

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:30.600
he'd settle down in the south

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:31.840
and never come back.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.400
Didn't you ever think about

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:37.030
going to Guangzhou to see him,

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.010
or maybe

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.580
going with him at the time?

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.630
I... I had just gotten married
at that time

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:43.760
and couldn't leave.

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:45.370
Besides,

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:46.820
the south might be nice,

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.550
but it's not as good as Tianduo.

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:50.230
It's my hometown, after all.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:51.650
True.

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:53.460
You've been in Tianduo a long time.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:54.600
That's right.

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:56.370
Like... uh...

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:57.460
Mazhi,

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.190
Dingduo,

00:11:58.270 --> 00:11:58.910
Dongxiang—

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:00.360
I lived in all those places
when I was younger.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.890
I know those counties well.

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:02.630
Really?

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:04.840
Auntie,

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:05.790
can you help me

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:07.940
look through some photos of suspects?

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.750
Me? Can I?

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:11.460
Does it have anything to do with me?

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:12.170
It has nothing to do with you.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:13.170
Don't be nervous.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:14.170
I just

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.100
want you to help identify someone.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.320
After all, some of the cases

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.530
are about to reach
the statute of limitations.

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:20.510
I was thinking,

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:21.860
since you've been all over Tianduo,

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:22.870
lived everywhere,

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:24.200
and know a lot of people,

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:25.630
you could help me recall—

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:26.240
maybe,

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:27.980
just maybe, you'll remember some clues.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.060
Please take a look for me.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:30.300
Okay, okay.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.730
Then, let me...

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:32.720
let me get my glasses.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.120
Okay.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.790
Any small detail will do.

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:36.460
If you recognize someone, great,

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.390
but it doesn't matter if you can't.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:39.630
There are five photos in total.

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:40.460
Take your time.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:40.990
Alright.

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:43.870
I don't know this one.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.430
This one is actually kind of handsome.

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:49.270
Back then,

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.360
if he looked like this in a photo,

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.050
he must have been
even better-looking in person.

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:53.290
If I had seen him,

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.700
I definitely wouldn't have forgotten.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:57.790
This one...

00:12:58.390 --> 00:12:59.860
This one looks like a colleague of mine

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:00.990
from back in the day.

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:03.550
But that colleague of mine...

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.100
was a bit bald.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:08.200
This...

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:11.530
Um...

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:12.880
This one...

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.050
This... This one is way too blurry.

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:17.180
I can't see clearly.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.600
No wonder you can't catch the guy.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.060
Bai,

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:21.930
I'm really sorry.

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:23.060
I couldn't help you.

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:23.860
It's okay, Auntie.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.360
I was just trying my luck.

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.050
Thank you, Auntie.

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:28.510
Okay.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.860
Wang Fumin is the victim?

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:37.510
Do you have evidence?

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:38.480
Not yet.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:40.940
Previously, based on

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:42.270
the skeletal analysis,

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.580
we speculated that the body was Duojie.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.410
Among the items left at the scene,

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:47.600
we found some physical evidence

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.660
left by the killer.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.390
Based on that evidence, we inferred

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:51.410
that the missing employee
from Hongyuan Freight Company,

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:52.910
Wang Fumin,

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:54.940
was the suspect who killed Duojie.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.480
According to our investigation,

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.190
Wang Fumin

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:57.960
went abroad to work

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:58.980
17 years ago

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:00.870
and hasn't been heard from since.

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:01.990
It looks like

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.710
he fled to escape punishment.

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:05.130
But isn't there

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:06.390
another possibility?

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:07.960
You mean...

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:10.150
Wang Fumin was killed?

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:10.990
Yes.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.240
There's no record of him abroad,

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:15.820
possibly because

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:17.220
he never left the country

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:19.180
and was buried in the wilderness

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.190
for 17 years.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:22.500
Also,

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:24.250
based on the photos we obtained

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:25.790
and our questioning of the family,

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:26.620
his build

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.390
is similar to Duojie's.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:29.630
Moreover,

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:31.640
since Meng's mother could recognize

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.300
Wang Fumin,

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:33.580
I suspect Meng Yaohui

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.580
is also connected

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:35.620
to Wang Fumin.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:36.670
Then we need to verify

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:38.130
this theory of yours ASAP.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.120
Contact

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:40.430
Wang Fumin's son immediately

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:42.430
and collect his DNA for comparison.

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:45.750
Hello?

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.250
Is anyone there?

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:49.270
Wang Jian!

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:50.080
Wang Jian!

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:51.860
Wang Jian?

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:52.670
Hello?

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:54.460
Are you here to collect a debt

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.140
for yourself or on someone else's behalf?

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:57.070
What did you say?

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:00.920
Police!

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:02.810
We are police officers.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:04.260
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.190
Will you please cooperate with us?

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:08.470
Oh, you're police officers.

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:09.480
I thought

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:11.530
you were the debt collectors again.

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:13.270
Does Wang Jian

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:14.460
owe money?

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:16.150
He moved out because of his debts.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:17.860
He claimed his startup failed,

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.560
but actually, he loved
buying lottery tickets

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.620
and hoped to strike it rich every day.

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:22.830
When did he move out?

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:24.950
Do you know where he went?

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:26.340
Just a while ago.

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:28.020
After the police came looking for him,

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:28.640
he packed up

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.640
in a real hurry

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:30.620
a few days later.

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:31.870
Didn't say where he was going either.

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:32.610
Just loaded

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:33.840
some luggage into a van.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.440
He left a lot of stuff behind.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:38.700
Thank you, sir.

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:40.070
Sorry to bother you.

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:54.910
Mom.

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:58.240
You're back so late.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.200
Have you eaten?

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:00.950
I have.

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:02.170
You have?

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:05.510
You didn't drink?

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.320
No business dinner today.

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.720
I went to Dongxiang for some work.

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:13.010
You went to Dongxiang again?

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:15.240
I made a pot of tea.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.100
Come have a cup.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:21.980
Freshly brewed.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.140
I need to take this.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:29.150
Hello?

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:31.480
Don't push your luck.

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:34.040
I said I can't give you any more.

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:36.000
Leave immediately.

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.750
I'll give you an apartment in Dingduo.

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:40.950
Once you get there...

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:42.580
Once you get there,

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:43.910
you'll get another one.

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:00.340
Auntie.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:01.460
Bai,

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:02.840
what's up?

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:04.609
Nothing big.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.849
I just wanted to ask

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:07.069
if Yaohui has been

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:08.660
very busy these past few days.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:09.770
It seems so.

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:11.359
Why?

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:12.349
Have things not been

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:14.280
going well between you two lately?

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:16.050
Yeah.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:17.950
I've been texting him
these past couple of days,

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:20.050
and he hasn't been responding
very quickly.

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:20.589
I don't know

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:21.990
what he's been busy with.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.810
Now that you mention it,

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:24.849
I feel

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:26.200
he's been acting

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.599
a bit strange lately too.

00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:28.750
Really?

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:30.750
What's going on with him?

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:31.610
Yaohui has been

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.320
acting all secretive lately.

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:34.880
When I asked where he went,

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:35.880
he even lied to me,

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:37.730
saying he went to Dongxiang.

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:39.190
He went there again today.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.380
After he came back,

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:42.500
he was on the phone on the balcony,

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:43.720
saying something about

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.120
an apartment in Dingduo.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.550
He might have another woman in Dingduo.

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:49.480
But don't worry.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:51.320
I'm on your side.

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:53.610
I know, Auntie.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:54.760
Please help me

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:55.810
keep an eye on him.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.300
No problem.

00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:58.680
Leave it to me.

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:00.830
I'll hang up then, Auntie.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:19.460
Enjoy your meal.

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:29.180
So

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.280
if I hadn't called,

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:32.330
you still wouldn't have come to see me?

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:33.030
No.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:37.740
Shao.

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:40.420
I'm sorry.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.120
I've realized something.

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:45.150
You

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.440
Mountain Patrol folks

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:47.890
are all pretty passive

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:49.690
when it comes to relationships.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:51.820
I just thought

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:52.980
you were still mad.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.700
Ji is definitely still mad.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.560
That's why I'm playing peacemaker here.

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:00.810
So you're not mad anymore?

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:02.370
You might not

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.630
get your money back.

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:05.950
If getting angry paid off,

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:07.700
I'd do it every day.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.040
Visit Mom when you have time.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.230
I only came to see you

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:17.050
for her sake.

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:18.330
What's wrong with Mom?

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:20.190
You and Ji are fighting like this.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.590
And Chun has been missing for days too.

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:24.500
We finally reached him by phone that day,

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:24.940
but we don't know

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:26.230
if it was bad reception in the mines

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:27.010
or what—

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:29.420
he just said he didn't wanna do it anymore

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:30.820
and hung up immediately.

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:31.940
Do you know

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.000
how worried Mom is?

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:37.320
That's all I'll say.

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:39.790
Act a little more mature.

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:42.830
And another thing.

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:44.800
Did you

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:46.000
block me on Moments?

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:48.220
No, I didn't.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:50.130
You're accusing me wrongly here.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.010
Look.

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:53.340
I haven't posted anything on Moments.

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:53.770
Look.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:55.810
That's right!

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:56.250
I haven't seen

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:57.650
a single update from you!

00:19:57.850 --> 00:19:58.200
I don't know

00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.500
what you've been up to lately!

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:00.530
So what can I do?

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:05.010

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:07.070
he posts on Moments every day.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:08.870

Who is he?

This is Lin Jianshe?

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.000
How...

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:25.410
How...

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:26.740
how did he change so much?

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:27.180
He looks like

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:28.510
he's been inflated or something.

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:29.170
He's so fat.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.080
He's

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:32.000
living the good life abroad now.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:33.030
I heard

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:34.200
he even married

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.420
a foreign wife.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:36.290
Really?

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:41.220
He's certainly

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:42.350
doing quite well.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:45.910
But

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:47.390
how do you have his WeChat?

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.700
Back when we started using WeChat,

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:50.070
wasn't there a feature

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:51.330
that recommended friends

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:52.830
from your contacts?

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:54.960
He added me.

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:57.570
Why did he add you?

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:58.390
To show off.

00:20:58.420 --> 00:20:59.240
Why else?

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:00.460
He obviously wanted to flaunt it,

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:01.240
like, "Look at me, I'm abroad now,

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.640
living it up."

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:03.330
I'm telling you,

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:04.050
my Moments feed

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:04.880
is full of people like that.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.000
One more or one less

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:07.220
makes no difference.

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:20.770
How does Lin Jianshe know him?

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:22.220

No, no.

I'm sending it to myself.

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:34.510
Okay, sent.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:34.960
Look.

Chun, are you there?

I'm coming in.

I haven't been able to

reach him these past few days either.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:40.270
But I think

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:42.090
he really needs some rest.

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:43.380
What happened?

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:45.910
The regreening work has probably

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:47.440
put a lot of pressure on him.

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:48.330
Fortunately,

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:48.830
the inspection team

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:50.890
is quite satisfied with our results.

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:53.300
Then where did he go?

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:55.260
He didn't tell me that,

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:56.390
and I didn't ask.

00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:58.420
It works out, actually.

00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.310
He hasn't really

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:01.500
taken any annual leave
these past few years.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.430

Thank you

for giving the money to my mom.

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:29.050
It came out of your own pocket.

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:30.450
It was your money anyway.

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:32.050
But

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:33.250
you gave her the money

as a police officer.

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:34.940

that the money was really recovered.

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:38.680

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:52.060
I went to see your old teammate,

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:53.590
the herder.

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:56.290
I know.

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:58.500
I still hope you all can

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:00.160
seriously

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:01.330
think about it.

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:03.610
Sometimes,

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.340
when people get stuck in the past

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:06.940
or trapped by an obsession,

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:08.910
they just can't move forward.

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:26.240
Bai Ju.

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:28.610
You've been to

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:29.960
Bolamula so many times,

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:31.390
and you've been through

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:32.340
so much.

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.770
Have you ever thought about

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:36.270
just living well?

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.390
What counts as "living well"?

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:42.250
Moving on

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:44.160
and choosing

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:45.380
an easier path

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:47.710
instead of a lonely one.

00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:57.720
You've been in the Mountain Patrol

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.180
for over a year now, right?

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:03.000
It's been a year and ten months.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.480
No.

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:15.200
Think again.

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:27.220
It's been 18 years

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:29.350
and 10 months.

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:36.720
That really has been a long, long time.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:41.990
You've been gone for 17 years

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:43.120
and never came back.

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:49.280
I'm almost

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:50.550
as old as you now.

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:58.220
You've just matured.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:03.180
Have I?

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:09.400
But a lot of the time,

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.030
I'm still the same as before—

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:17.440
not knowing if

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.550
what I'm doing now

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:21.480
is right.

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.400
Just like in Bolamula,

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.550
not knowing whether to

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:32.750
keep following the path I chose.

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:36.300
If I keep going,

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:41.300
is home waiting ahead...

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:46.010
or just deeper desolation?

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:57.980
What do you think?

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:07.400
Not home yet?

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:09.310
Be careful on the road.

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:10.910
Call me if you need anything.

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:16.520
You're home,

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:18.340
but I didn't want to wake you.

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:12.400
It feels like after all these years,

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:14.000
it really hasn't grown much.

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:15.240
Do you think

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:16.030
we should give it

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:17.630
some more fertilizer, Chun?

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:22.160
How did you know I was here?

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:26.480
Because this is our home.

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:29.220
Where else could you go

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:30.850
besides here?

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:37.460
Look up.

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:39.010
What for?

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:40.450
Send it to Mom

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:41.540
so she won't worry.

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.570
She was afraid something happened to me,

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:46.500
so she asked you to come check on me?

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:49.560
She didn't ask.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.380
I wanted to come myself.

00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:01.240
While you were away,

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:03.630
something big happened at home.

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:06.080
What happened?

00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:09.400
I feel that my presence

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:12.160
is the greatest comfort

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.380
and encouragement to you.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:15.940
Because

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:17.240
having you by my side

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.130
is the greatest comfort for me too.

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:23.860
What exactly happened?

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:29.110
I had a fight with Bai Ji.

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.570
He's never been able to out-argue you
since childhood.

00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:36.100
What was it about this time?

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.640
You really are a worrier.

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:39.240
Take care of yourself first.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.700
What have you been doing,

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.300
staying here alone all this time?

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:50.920
Nothing much.

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.200
Just thinking about what I could do.

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.060
But even if I'd done something...

00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:57.960
it would've felt like

00:32:57.960 --> 00:32:59.290
I'd done nothing at all.

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:05.770
Have you been practicing tongue twisters?

00:33:05.770 --> 00:33:06.250
Yes.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:12.220
When Dad

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.660
planted this tree,

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:17.250
we all thought it wouldn't survive.

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:18.530
Who would have thought

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:19.860
it'd grow this tall now?

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.350
At the time, this was

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:26.180
the only tree

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:27.200
in our county.

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:32.170
When Dad planted it,

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:33.960
he surely couldn't have imagined

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:34.700
there would be

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:35.850
other trees now too.

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:38.070
I bet even this tree itself

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:39.090
didn't expect

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.810
to become...

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:45.480
the King of Trees here.

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:47.250
That's so cheesy.

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:49.460
Good thing Zhuling's name

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.660
wasn't chosen by you.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:51.740
Cheesy?

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:54.350
Think about the vitality of a tree.

00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:57.180
It never chooses its destination.

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.500
Once it takes root,

00:33:58.590 --> 00:33:59.850
it never moves an inch.

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.300
It entrusts its life to the earth,

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:05.500
wind, rain, and sunlight.

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:07.330
Do you know who in our family

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:08.389
is most like a tree?

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.320
Me?

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:12.500
It's Mom.

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:14.400
You...

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:15.699
You're like a rock.

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:21.150
You're terrible at comforting people.

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:22.880
What's wrong with being a rock?

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:26.560
A rock can lie on a mountain,

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:28.330
be buried in the soil,

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:29.980
or rest in a river.

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:32.690
With water flowing over it,

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.480
after years of washing and weathering,

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:36.639
it'll become rounder

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:37.770
and smoother,

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:38.980
or change

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:40.960
into some other shape.

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:49.050
But you

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:50.659
are still you.

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:00.820
Bai Ju.

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:03.650
Don't you have anything

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:04.780
to ask me?

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:06.690
About what?

00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:11.670
About Xinhai.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:15.650
If you want to talk about it,

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:17.050
you'll tell me yourself.

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:18.610
I don't need to ask.

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:30.540
I've already handed this photo over

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:32.500
to the Provincial
Discipline Inspection Commission.

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:34.210
They're taking it very seriously.

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:36.120
We just need to know

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:38.010
what exactly happened back then.

00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:39.300
Even a small piece of information

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:40.720
could be a breakthrough.

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:44.170
They just classified it as

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:46.630
"picking quarrels and provoking trouble."

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:48.870
What do you mean?

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.190
I reported them

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.280
back then.

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:55.030
Later,

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:55.630
they caught

00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:56.900
the guy

00:35:56.930 --> 00:35:57.860
who broke my leg.

00:35:58.210 --> 00:35:59.300
But they only charged him with

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.590
"picking quarrels and provoking trouble."

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:02.760
Feng Keqing did it?

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:09.260
Now

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:11.190
I don't know

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:12.080
how deep

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:14.030
his connections go.

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:17.420
Actually,

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:18.930
compared to Feng Keqing,

00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:20.920
the one who shocked

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:22.410
and disappointed me more

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:24.310
was County Mayor Lin.

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:27.810
Feng Keqing

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:28.500
was the one who

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.430
introduced me to County Mayor Lin.

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:33.070
I gave him coal,

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:35.440
and I even promised his son

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:36.270
a job at Tengda

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:38.210
after graduation.

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:39.440
Yes.

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:40.750
I admit

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:42.400
I had selfish motives at the time.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.480
But we should judge by actions,
not intentions, right?

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.300
I believe

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.500
I can honestly say

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:47.730
I did right

00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:49.700
by County Mayor Lin.

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:52.550
But...

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:56.040
after Tengda changed hands,

00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:57.640
Lin Jianshe

00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:59.170
still went to work there.

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.300
Feng Keqing arranged it?

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:01.830
Who else could it have been?

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:02.680
Lin Jianshe

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:04.070
went abroad not long after that.

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:04.930
They said it was

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:06.230
a company program

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:07.800
for talent development.

00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:09.570
Some talent.

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:16.260
Things

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:17.830
are really different now?

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:21.150
Yes.

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:23.130
The Provincial
Discipline Inspection Commission

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:24.010
is paying close attention to this matter.

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:24.760
They want to find out

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:25.890
who their backer is.

00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:27.010
You've provided us

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:28.230
with a crucial lead.

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:55.360
The transfer fee was...

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:56.750
was 10,000 yuan?

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:00.360
A company

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:02.780
plus my leg—

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:04.480
10,000 yuan.

00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:06.860
Ridiculous, isn't it?

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:14.210
You know, a rock can wait

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:16.070
hundreds of millions of years

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:17.780
and produce something.

00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:19.230
But humans can't.

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:20.510
Here.

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:22.360
Take this too.

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:24.450
Both of them are yours.

00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:25.050
Take them.

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:27.330
Manager Zhao,

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:30.070
would you be willing to go with me

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:31.530
to the provincial capital

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:32.730
as a whistleblower

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:33.980
to report

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:35.420
Lin Peisheng's connections from back then

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:38.480
to the Provincial
Discipline Inspection Commission?

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:46.650
Who?

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:51.920
That guy is still alive?

00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:57.570
Got it.

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:00.110
Then...

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:01.560
when should I go?

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:04.440
Okay.

00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:06.380
Got it.

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.690
In the back.

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:35.530
Him in the back.

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:38.990
Here!

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:43.090
What's wrong?

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:47.850
When will we get to the rest stop?

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.530
Didn't we just stop?

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:51.860
Don't worry.

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:53.150
We don't need a break.

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:54.430
Later,

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:56.190
Reporter Shao and I
will take turns driving.

00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:57.900
We'll reach the provincial capital soon.

00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:59.880
I want a break.

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.370
Then go to sleep.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:03.570
Well, just now...

00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:05.550
I drank a bit too much water.

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:07.480
I drank quite a lot too.

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:09.630
I'm older than you!

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:10.910
When you get to my age,

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:12.010
you'll understand.

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:13.470
When you get older, you...

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:15.340
you just can't hold it in.

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:19.090
Quick, pull over.

00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:21.770
Manager Zhao, hang on.

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:23.080
I'll pull over for you.

00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:24.710
No, no.

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:26.680
There's no cover here.

00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:27.730
Well...

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:30.120
Some things you can hold,

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:31.840
and some you just can't.

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:34.370
It's not that I can't hold it at all,

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:36.510
but I can't hold everything either.

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:37.340
Alright, alright.

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:38.250
Well, don't worry.

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:38.980
Just up ahead,

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:40.110
there's a rest stop.

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:41.780
Just hold it a bit longer.

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:43.860
Hurry, hurry.

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:11.030
No, thanks.

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:17.500
The old man is quite particular.

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.970
You think everyone is like you?

00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:24.510
What are you doing?

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:26.220
Reporting to my leader.

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:29.800
"Everything is going well on the road.

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.440
Remember to eat on time."

00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:37.190
You care so much about your leader.

00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:38.000
You have

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:39.170
great eyesight.

00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:41.920
I can even see there's a car

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:43.410
parked on that mountain.

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:50.050
Is that a car?

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:51.670
That black dot there.

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:53.670
Look closely.

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:55.230
Amazing, amazing.

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:02.040
Why is Manager Zhao taking so long?

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.110
The signal is bad.

00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:33.330
Manager Zhao?

00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:37.820
Manager Zhao!

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:40.090
Shao!

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:42.460
Shao!

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:43.340
Zhacuo!

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:44.320
Zhacuo!

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:08.390
Zhacuo!
