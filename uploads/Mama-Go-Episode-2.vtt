00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:28.760
You're putting on an act with me, aren't you?

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.679
You think you're tough now, huh? No, no.

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:30.239
Skipping school on me.

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:30.679
Stop moving around.

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:31.559
Skipping school... Look, look who this is.

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:32.039
You damn kid.

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:33.000
Look, you little brat.

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:48.960
Amazing, right?

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:58.560
Am I dead?

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.159
Or is this the final rally before the end?

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.000
How do I explain this... it's just...

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:10.159
You...

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.920
Just think of it as...

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.519
A dream.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.719
The kind that moves you when you wake up.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.439
That kind of sweet dream.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.959
Sweet dream.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.359
So beautiful.

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:27.560
Sweet dream.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.879
What sweet dream?!

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.519
Why is a damn kid like you in my dream?

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.560
Get the hell out of my dream!

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.719
Mom, Mom, no... you...

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.719
Hurry up, disappear!

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:37.359
I did a lot.

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:38.480
Okay, okay, okay.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.519
Mom, Mom, don't be like this.

00:01:39.519 --> 00:01:40.079
Get out! I...

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:40.319
I...

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.879
I'm disappearing.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.000
This jet-black, smooth...

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.719
...glossy hair.

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.000
These smooth, tender...

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:11.000
...and youthful hands.

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:17.400
This dazzling sunlight.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.479
Is this really a dream?

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:34.800
If this is a dream...

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.199
...then let a hearty rain fall!

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.719
Call for wind, get wind.

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:50.439
Call for rain, get rain.

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:54.719
Then let this sunshower come even more violently!

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.840
Wonder which influencer agency she's from.

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:44.080
Shooting short videos with a phone...

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.479
...and they brought in such a huge water truck.

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:48.719
This is respect for traffic.

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:50.039
Respect for one's profession.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.199
I really like this attitude.

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.719
Xiaotian.

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:57.400
Although you've achieved some success now...

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.879
...you must not get complacent.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.319
We still have a long way to go.

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:02.599
Emulate those better than you.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.719
Let's encourage each other.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.800
Wei Mingtian, I love you!

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.120
Mingtian!

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:40.439
Excuse me, excuse me.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.120
Finally, an artist who isn't late.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.879
Yeah, exactly.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.519
Looks like we can get off work on time today.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.319
Let's go.

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.160
Okay, let's change the pose, sir.

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:10.399
Hello, welcome.

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:16.959
Hello, welcome.

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:21.839
First thing after being reborn is grocery shopping.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.680
Average male life expectancy is 72 to 80.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.399
Let's compromise and say 75.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.920
75 minus 25 years.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.959
I can still live 50...

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:38.160
...living another 30 years is enough.

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:39.920
Won't have to suffer before kicking the bucket.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.480
Ms. Kong Guifang.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.319
I got you twenty-five years back.

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:00.720
Is this all the ambition you have?

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.360
Five beef patties.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.240
Coming right up.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.519
Here, girl.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.839
Thanks, thanks Sister Zhang.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.680
You...

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:13.240
Auntie Zhang, here... I... I'm paying...

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.519
My friend, my friend.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.240
Climbing the slope isn't tiring at all.

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:42.839
Look at me walking on air.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.639
Sister Thirteen.

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:55.720
Kid Star, Xiao Long.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.720
Third Sister, Fourth Sister, Brother Hu.

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:58.040
Carry on, carry on.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:58.600
Who is that?

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:00.240
No manners at all.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.360
I'm your elder!

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:02.480
Old Li.

00:07:02.519 --> 00:07:03.240
Wait for me.

00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:05.600
Auntie Thirteen, Master Star, Brother Long.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.040
Third Aunt, Fourth Great-Aunt, Grandpa Hu.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.240
Slow down.

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:10.240
This little brat.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.519
His mom's only been in the hospital a few days...

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:13.879
...and he's already brought a girl back.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.279
Do you need a key to open the door in a dream too?

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.600
I don't need a son in my dream.

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:36.079
Go away.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.079
Crazy.

00:07:57.439 --> 00:07:58.639
He's really gone.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:16.560
So white.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.000
So smooth.

00:08:18.839 --> 00:08:19.600
So young.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.079
Chased the big son away.

00:08:27.959 --> 00:08:29.399
Now the little brat can come in.

00:08:58.759 --> 00:09:00.960
Haven't been this smooth in a long time.

00:09:03.519 --> 00:09:03.879
Wait.

00:09:04.399 --> 00:09:06.000
Can't use the bathroom in a dream, right?

00:09:19.159 --> 00:09:20.919
No need to save water in a dream either.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.440
We don't need these kinds of details, right?

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.519
I've been menopausal for two years.

00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:53.240
Mom, let me tell you.

00:09:53.399 --> 00:09:54.879
Today you speak harsh words to me.

00:09:55.519 --> 00:09:57.039
Tomorrow you'll regret it for life.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.600
Isn't there a saying online? Right?

00:09:59.039 --> 00:10:00.440
If one could trade a life for a life,

00:10:00.559 --> 00:10:01.960
Heaven would be full of moms.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:03.480
And me.

00:10:08.039 --> 00:10:09.000
If you're so capable, open the door.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.480
Then are you capable of turning into a sanitary pad?

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.360
Grandpa Hu, Fourth Great Aunt, Third Aunt.

00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:18.480
Brother Long, Master Star, Auntie Thirteen.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.039
I'm a good son who buys pads for Mom.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.360
My mom has to forgive me now, right?

00:10:47.159 --> 00:10:47.960
You that mad?

00:10:48.399 --> 00:10:49.159
Can't let it go?

00:10:56.879 --> 00:10:59.919
That guy, are you asking for it?

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.320
Stealing my spot.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.480
So much nonsense.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.960
Just let me carry you.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.399
That marksman you're playing...

00:11:05.399 --> 00:11:06.960
Do you have ADHD?

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.759
Why did you Flash in place?

00:11:08.759 --> 00:11:10.240
Are you doing a standing long jump?

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.960
Have you no shame?

00:11:14.919 --> 00:11:15.279
Nice.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:16.840
Perfect.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:20.480
Li Wai.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.720
You know, we grew up together.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:23.799
I really envy you.

00:11:24.159 --> 00:11:24.960
You are already...

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.519
so childish now.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.679
You have the nerve to scold me?

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.399
But as for me...

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.639
Let's meet up if you have the guts.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.000
I've already achieved a great feat.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:33.360
You're on.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.039
And become a real man.

00:11:35.039 --> 00:11:36.240
And the pillar of the family.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:36.720
Come on.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.240
I really...

00:11:38.559 --> 00:11:38.919
Bro.

00:11:39.759 --> 00:11:40.440
Has Godmom landed yet?

00:11:40.639 --> 00:11:41.600
Landed where? What landing?

00:11:43.279 --> 00:11:44.639
Didn't you say she went abroad for treatment?

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:47.320
Yeah.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.919
She should be... almost in Milan by now.

00:11:49.639 --> 00:11:50.320
Milan?

00:11:51.799 --> 00:11:52.960
She... she's transferring there.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.279
The tickets are cheap.

00:11:55.399 --> 00:11:56.279
It's just that foreign...

00:11:56.799 --> 00:11:57.679
My aunt, you know.

00:11:57.679 --> 00:11:58.200
She arranged it for her.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.039
She's just getting some cosmetic procedures done.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.559
There are places nearby for cosmetic procedures.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:04.679
Why go so far?

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:05.639
Doesn't matter, doesn't matter.

00:12:05.799 --> 00:12:06.759
Don't... don't worry about it.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:09.519
It's not serious, right?

00:12:13.559 --> 00:12:14.360
Oh my god.

00:12:21.639 --> 00:12:22.919
Do you think a mother...

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:24.879
could really abandon her own child?

00:12:26.039 --> 00:12:26.440
Sure.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:27.240
My mom.

00:12:27.639 --> 00:12:28.440
I'm being serious.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.519
I'm being serious too.

00:12:31.399 --> 00:12:32.519
Although I don't remember clearly...

00:12:33.159 --> 00:12:33.919
but...

00:12:34.279 --> 00:12:35.200
my mom told me...

00:12:35.639 --> 00:12:36.879
ever since she gave birth to me...

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:37.840
she only did two things every day.

00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:39.320
Housework and childcare.

00:12:39.399 --> 00:12:40.320
Housework and childcare.

00:12:40.559 --> 00:12:41.559
I was really naughty when I was little.

00:12:41.759 --> 00:12:43.399
Eating, pooping, and wandering everywhere.

00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:44.600
My mom even said...

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.200
she'd trade ten years of her life...

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.720
for one day of peace without the kid.

00:12:51.159 --> 00:12:53.039
Ten years of life?

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.799
Weren't you raised by your dad?

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.679
That's because my mom had a breakdown.

00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:01.799
Our family was falling apart.

00:13:01.799 --> 00:13:03.200
The whole rhythm was off.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.559
So my dad had to quit his job...

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.200
to become a house husband...

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.320
and let my mom go out to work.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.360
That's when my mom got better.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:10.600
You have no idea.

00:13:10.799 --> 00:13:11.639
sometimes even now...

00:13:11.639 --> 00:13:12.720
they still argue about it.

00:13:12.799 --> 00:13:14.000
It breaks my heart when they fight.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:14.960
It's a total breakdown.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:18.720
Stop watching so many skits.

00:13:18.919 --> 00:13:19.519
Exactly.

00:13:22.559 --> 00:13:24.039
So your dad treats you okay?

00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:27.000
Of course my dad treats me well.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:28.480
But...

00:13:28.799 --> 00:13:29.639
my dad is my dad.

00:13:29.679 --> 00:13:30.519
I'm my dad's son.

00:13:30.879 --> 00:13:32.639
It's only right for my dad to raise me.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.879
Raising a child isn't just my mom's job.

00:13:35.159 --> 00:13:35.960
My mom is a person too.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.519
She has things she wants to do too.

00:13:41.799 --> 00:13:43.440
Things she wants to do.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.600
Since bringing Xiaocan to this city

00:13:55.759 --> 00:13:57.480
I only remember working

00:13:58.159 --> 00:13:58.759
Supporting the family

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.320
Taking care of Xiaocan

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.519
Now, this kind of aimless wandering

00:14:05.799 --> 00:14:07.000
I'm actually a bit unaccustomed to it

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.480
I've never had the chance

00:14:10.879 --> 00:14:12.639
To properly observe this city

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.200
Seems I never thought about what I wanted to do

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.559
But just watching all these different people

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.080
This feeling

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.279
Is already very good

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:28.799
This dream

00:14:29.919 --> 00:14:31.559
If I could keep dreaming it

00:14:32.039 --> 00:14:32.720
That would be great

00:14:36.879 --> 00:14:37.519
What are you looking at?

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.440
What kind of stuff can make money?

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.240
Bro, you want to make money?

00:14:45.639 --> 00:14:47.600
My mom's medical bills, going abroad, doesn't it all

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:48.840
Cost money?

00:14:48.879 --> 00:14:49.480
Don't I have to

00:14:49.919 --> 00:14:50.559
Step up?

00:14:53.159 --> 00:14:54.519
Why don't you be a gaming companion with me?

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.840
Can that make money? Will it work?

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:56.480
No.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.200
Just with your skill level

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.600
You play, I pay.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:00.440
No, no, no.

00:15:02.519 --> 00:15:02.879
Brother.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.320
Seriously help me think.

00:15:04.519 --> 00:15:05.759
What can I do right now to make money?

00:15:05.759 --> 00:15:06.679
You could get a job.

00:15:06.679 --> 00:15:08.480
Delivery, courier, aren't those okay?

00:15:08.519 --> 00:15:09.440
Yeah, okay.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:09.840
No.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.360
You can't handle that hardship.

00:15:11.679 --> 00:15:12.159
True.

00:15:12.559 --> 00:15:14.519
Between being spoiled and working

00:15:15.159 --> 00:15:16.519
Do we have something transitional?

00:15:16.639 --> 00:15:18.480
Like quick money but not too tiring.

00:15:19.519 --> 00:15:20.200
Donate blood.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:20.799
Okay.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.320
No.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.960
You donate all that blood

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.080
Then spending money on food to recover costs more.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.039
Mainly, blood donation is unpaid now.

00:15:29.159 --> 00:15:29.519
Right.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:30.600
Can't be tiring.

00:15:31.039 --> 00:15:32.120
Gotta be quick money.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.720
Can't cross legal red lines.

00:15:36.039 --> 00:15:36.559
Let me think again.

00:15:38.519 --> 00:15:39.720
Can't cross moral bottom lines either.

00:15:39.759 --> 00:15:40.159
Go to sleep.

00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:41.799
No, no, no. Think about it.

00:15:41.879 --> 00:15:42.840
Think, think.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:43.960
Urgent. Be serious.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.159
I really give up on you.

00:15:48.559 --> 00:15:49.440
Livestreaming.

00:15:50.039 --> 00:15:51.000
I was just about to say that.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:51.720
Livestreaming works.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.519
You're the man.

00:15:52.679 --> 00:15:53.320
That won't work.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.360
Although livestreaming nowadays

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:54.840
Has passed that

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.320
That peak period

00:15:56.559 --> 00:15:57.159
But let me tell you

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.120
We'll win by quantity.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:58.960
True, we can't make big money.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.519
Getting some small tips is... is fine too.

00:16:00.519 --> 00:16:01.759
But bro, there's one thing.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:02.600
This livestreaming

00:16:02.799 --> 00:16:04.840
We have to choose our lane clearly.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:05.480
Choose then.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:06.240
Mukbang.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:06.639
Okay.

00:16:06.759 --> 00:16:07.159
No.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:08.960
First, you're picky.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.080
Second, you can't eat much.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.039
Talent.

00:16:12.039 --> 00:16:12.600
Okay.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:12.960
No.

00:16:13.519 --> 00:16:14.320
You only know how to whistle.

00:16:14.759 --> 00:16:15.399
What else can you do?

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:16.799
What are you doing? You...

00:16:16.919 --> 00:16:18.240
Every time you get me fired up

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.720
You pour cold water on me.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:20.399
You can't do this.

00:16:21.039 --> 00:16:21.840
Bro.

00:16:23.039 --> 00:16:23.759
We have one

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.360
The most... innate advantage

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.720
That we bypassed.

00:16:26.759 --> 00:16:27.200
What?

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:28.919
Good looks.

00:16:32.879 --> 00:16:33.759
With these looks

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.559
Visual streamers

00:16:34.559 --> 00:16:35.720
This niche is spot on

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.960
Why think about useless stuff

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.320
No, do my looks

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:40.320
make the cut?

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.159
Definitely

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.320
Bro, did you forget?

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.879
The second handsomest at Heping No. 2 Primary

00:16:43.919 --> 00:16:44.919
Stop messing around, I'm telling you

00:16:44.919 --> 00:16:46.159
With looks like ours

00:16:46.399 --> 00:16:46.960
Alright, stop it

00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:49.320
How shameless do you have to be to be a visual streamer?

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.120
Give me a break

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:50.759
Here goes. No

00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:53.159
Hello everyone

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.320
We are the new visual streamers

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.000
The Long Dong Qiang Duo

00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.360
Why that name?

00:17:01.279 --> 00:17:01.759
No, us two

00:17:01.759 --> 00:17:03.039
No one. No one's watching

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:04.759
It's fine

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.680
People will come soon

00:17:05.759 --> 00:17:07.160
Turn on the beauty filter. For us

00:17:07.759 --> 00:17:08.960
What do we need a beauty filter for?

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:09.480
Isn't this fine?

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.359
Looks okay

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:10.960
Us two

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:12.480
Look just like that

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:19.680
Is... is it on?

00:17:19.759 --> 00:17:20.400
Is it on?

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:21.240
It's on

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:21.759
It's on, it's on

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:24.960
You're starting a battle?

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:25.680
Let's battle someone

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:26.160
Connect

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:26.480
Connect

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:27.480
Rejected

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.000
You have no viewers, who's gonna battle you?

00:17:33.319 --> 00:17:33.759
Me. Us two

00:17:33.759 --> 00:17:35.400
I... I'm going to the restroom, you watch it

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:38.240
Anyone here?

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:39.160
No

00:17:43.759 --> 00:17:44.480
Don't be like that. In a moment

00:17:44.839 --> 00:17:45.960
Can't show legs

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.640
We gotta be careful

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.920
We've been best friends since childhood

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.799
Back then, we were known as Heping No. 2 Primary's

00:17:52.559 --> 00:17:53.039
School hunks

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.359
There's no one, what do we say?

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.000
Opportunity favors the prepared

00:17:58.079 --> 00:17:58.720
Once someone comes in

00:17:59.119 --> 00:18:00.319
and sees it's exciting, they'll stay

00:18:00.319 --> 00:18:01.519
We can't... we have to keep talking

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:02.599
I'll whistle for everyone

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.359
Let's lie here a bit longer. Just a bit.

00:18:19.519 --> 00:18:20.000
Someone's here.

00:18:20.079 --> 00:18:20.599
We've got company.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.559
Welcome, welcome. Hello, hello.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.400
Welcome, welcome.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.279
We are... We are...

00:18:24.279 --> 00:18:25.480
We are the new...

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.119
Uh, uh, uh...

00:18:34.079 --> 00:18:34.799
Who are you calling ugly?

00:18:36.799 --> 00:18:37.519
Who is he calling ugly?

00:18:38.119 --> 00:18:38.799
Who? Say it.

00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:40.400
Not me. It's not me, right?

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.079
It can't be me, right?

00:18:41.359 --> 00:18:42.400
It... it can't be me.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:46.759
I've been ruled out.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:54.279
Why?

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.119
W-What?

00:18:57.519 --> 00:18:58.200
What's wrong with being short?

00:18:58.599 --> 00:18:59.519
Does being short bother you?

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:00.440
So what if he's ugly?

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:01.160
He's just ugly.

00:19:01.519 --> 00:19:02.319
Does it bother you?

00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:03.359
He's ugly and short.

00:19:06.599 --> 00:19:07.640
What's it to you?

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.039
Calling people ugly, calling people short.

00:19:09.079 --> 00:19:10.200
You big idiot.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.039
Darn it.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:16.319
Account banned.

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.079
Seriously.

00:19:20.599 --> 00:19:22.039
How could he tell I'm short?

00:19:27.119 --> 00:19:29.039
Bro, don't be too sad.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.039
Sometimes...

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.000
hearing the truth is good.

00:19:35.799 --> 00:19:37.359
Mainly, this is my fault too.

00:19:38.759 --> 00:19:39.680
I have a filter on you.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:41.400
Right?

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:41.759
You...

00:19:42.559 --> 00:19:43.440
Don't be sad either.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.279
Am I really that ugly?

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.920
You're not ugly. I think you're quite...

00:19:54.559 --> 00:19:54.920
Bro.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.599
That guy replied to me.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.079
Asked to meet tomorrow at six.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.200
Tomorrow morning at six.

00:19:59.359 --> 00:20:01.319
Fine. You pick the place, I'll be there.

00:20:01.759 --> 00:20:03.519
Whoever doesn't show is a coward.

00:20:04.599 --> 00:20:05.240
I'm not going.

00:20:16.599 --> 00:20:17.079
Can't sleep.

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.720
If I fall asleep, this sweet dream will end.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.400
How much?

00:20:23.599 --> 00:20:24.160
Twenty yuan.

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:42.400
Teacher.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.319
I'm dropping out.

00:20:45.359 --> 00:20:46.599
I can't take the college entrance exam anymore.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:48.960
Your grades are so good.

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.759
It's a shame to stop schooling.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.519
I know your family has gone through a lot.

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:54.359
But I believe...

00:20:54.359 --> 00:20:54.880
It's okay.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.319
There will be opportunities in the future.

00:20:59.799 --> 00:21:00.440
Goodbye, Teacher.

00:21:04.079 --> 00:21:04.720
Goodbye...

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.559
my high school.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.759
I'll never see...

00:21:10.839 --> 00:21:12.200
the university of my dreams.

00:21:18.759 --> 00:21:19.319
Uncle.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:21.880
Selling scrap.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:23.279
Okay.

00:21:28.119 --> 00:21:29.279
Aren't these all study books?

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:30.400
You don't want them?

00:21:34.599 --> 00:21:35.079
I don't want them.

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.599
How much for everything?

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.240
Selling this as scrap...

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:44.759
isn't worth much.

00:21:51.279 --> 00:21:52.039
So pitiful.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.319
A car accident.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:54.319
Mom is gone.

00:21:54.319 --> 00:21:54.799
Why?

00:21:54.799 --> 00:21:56.000
Dad hasn't even been discharged yet.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:58.680
Dad.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:00.680
A little girl all alone.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.000
What will she do in the future?

00:22:18.279 --> 00:22:20.000
It just rained outside

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.079
The air is nice

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:22.200
In a bit

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:23.839
I'll wheel you down

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.599
to get some fresh air

00:22:30.799 --> 00:22:32.519
It's so good to be able to go to school

00:22:37.359 --> 00:22:39.079
Parents usually write in cursive, right?

00:22:39.519 --> 00:22:40.640
This looks so real

00:22:40.799 --> 00:22:42.200
It looks exactly like your mom's writing

00:22:42.319 --> 00:22:43.839
We can definitely fool them today

00:22:44.039 --> 00:22:45.480
You won't get a beating today either

00:22:45.599 --> 00:22:47.359
Let me copy your math homework later

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.440
Then I want to copy your English

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:52.519
Let's go

00:22:52.599 --> 00:22:54.000
Off to McDonald's to play

00:22:55.119 --> 00:22:57.680
Kids these days are way too hardworking

00:23:05.119 --> 00:23:06.599
I'm going to the restroom, I'll be right back

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:07.640
Make sure you don't run off

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.000
Fans are very scary these days

00:23:10.319 --> 00:23:11.400
I saw at least five of them just now

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.680
They might be fans in disguise

00:23:14.759 --> 00:23:15.279
Don't run off

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:07.119
This is the spot

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:08.480
Bro

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.240
We'll go observe the situation in a bit

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.880
If That guy doesn't show up

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.319
we'll wait until seven thirty

00:25:13.599 --> 00:25:14.480
I'll treat you to beef offal noodles

00:25:15.079 --> 00:25:15.920
If he does show up

00:25:16.279 --> 00:25:17.279
we won't fight close quarters

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:18.440
We'll attack from a distance

00:25:19.279 --> 00:25:20.720
Spray him to death with this stuff

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:22.599
We run as soon as we spray

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:24.640
Once we're far away

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.960
I'll take a couple of photos of him

00:25:26.519 --> 00:25:27.920
I'll post them on the World Channel later

00:25:28.079 --> 00:25:28.839
and thoroughly humiliate him

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.240
I am simply a genius

00:25:33.759 --> 00:25:35.079
No one's here. Let's go eat noodles.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:36.039
Bro

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.200
We're already here

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.079
Don't chicken out. Wait a bit longer.

00:25:41.079 --> 00:25:41.960
Super Steel Cannon, da-da-da!

00:25:52.519 --> 00:25:53.319
You... you guys...

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:54.920
Who is That guy?

00:25:55.119 --> 00:25:58.559
We are all That guy

00:26:00.039 --> 00:26:01.200
Do... do you all live that close?

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.160
How many units are on your floor?

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.640
None of your business!

00:26:04.759 --> 00:26:06.680
Brothers, get the gear out!

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:26.720
Hello, Teacher!

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.279
Chase him!

00:26:29.519 --> 00:26:30.880
Chase! Chase him! Chase!

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.920
It's shameful if we lose!

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.400
If we win, we're monsters!

00:26:34.599 --> 00:26:35.359
Don't run!

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:12.319
Mom!

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:17.480
Perfect, perfect! You're right here.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.160
Quick, quick! Cover me!

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:18.559
Cover me!

00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:19.279
I can't, I can't, I can't...

00:27:19.559 --> 00:27:20.240
Someone's chasing me! Someone's chasing me! What are you doing?

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:20.880
How did you pop up again?

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:21.240
Don't ask.

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:21.960
Who? Who? Who?

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:22.720
Quick! Someone's chasing me!

00:27:23.599 --> 00:27:24.559
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?

00:27:25.119 --> 00:27:26.279
Up ahead! Up ahead! Chase him!

00:27:34.799 --> 00:27:35.359
That was close.

00:27:36.279 --> 00:27:36.920
Thanks to you, Mom.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.279
I almost didn't recognize you, Mom.

00:27:38.319 --> 00:27:39.440
You really are something.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:40.559
Mom! What are you doing? What are you doing?

00:27:40.559 --> 00:27:41.240
What are you doing, Mom?

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.759
Even in a dream, you won't let me have peace.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:43.880
You, all day long...

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:45.000
Can't you do something productive?

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.079
I am doing something productive!

00:27:46.079 --> 00:27:46.960
I did something huge!

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:47.559
What did you do?

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:48.839
Skipping school?

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:49.519
Lying to me?

00:27:49.519 --> 00:27:50.039
Going to the snow mountain?

00:27:50.039 --> 00:27:50.839
What else can you do?

00:27:51.359 --> 00:27:52.200
I'll beat you when I wake up.

00:27:53.079 --> 00:27:54.920
How come you're younger but your temper is bigger?

00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.519
Mom, Mom, Mom.

00:28:00.119 --> 00:28:00.519
How is it?

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.400
Now that you've returned to this state...

00:28:02.519 --> 00:28:03.039
Does it feel good?

00:28:03.519 --> 00:28:03.880
Is it awesome?

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.000
Since you're dreaming anyway...

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:05.559
Don't you want to...

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.440
do something earth-shattering?

00:28:08.079 --> 00:28:09.440
Like traveling the world?

00:28:09.599 --> 00:28:10.839
Eating delicacies from everywhere?

00:28:11.039 --> 00:28:12.839
You think everyone is as unproductive as you?

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.279
If I could go back to being twenty...

00:28:14.279 --> 00:28:15.200
I'd definitely go to school!

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:18.680
School?

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:23.119
Mom.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:24.319
I'll help you.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.279
What are you doing?

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.680
Isn't this Sister Zhang's house?

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.720
Why are you stealing Zhang Chi's clothes?

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.119
It's Zhang Chi's I'm stealing.

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.400
He doesn't like school anyway.

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.960
Don't talk nonsense. He's a good kid.

00:28:38.319 --> 00:28:39.079
What kind of good kid?

00:28:39.079 --> 00:28:40.319
All day long he just practices Peking Opera.

00:28:40.759 --> 00:28:41.640
Student Kong Guifang.

00:28:42.799 --> 00:28:43.440
Go to school.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.319
Fine. Satisfied?

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.440
Now it's starting to feel like a sweet dream.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:54.839
Go on.

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.480
Go dream about school.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.400
If you can't handle it...

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.079
give me a call.

00:29:01.079 --> 00:29:01.960
I'll come pick you up.

00:29:03.279 --> 00:29:03.839
Good luck!

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.519
Isn't that Mr. Yang who taught me?

00:29:15.039 --> 00:29:16.519
He gives away books if you take his class.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.119
Five sets a semester.

00:29:18.319 --> 00:29:19.119
My mom will probably...

00:29:19.119 --> 00:29:20.240
bring home who knows how many sets again.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:21.920
Oh my god.

00:29:22.119 --> 00:29:24.119
Welcome to my open class, everyone.

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.559
Sign up and get a free book.

00:29:25.559 --> 00:29:26.440
Everyone gets one. Come back.

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.079
Kong Guifang, come back.

00:29:28.079 --> 00:29:29.160
Buddy, get out, get out.

00:29:29.279 --> 00:29:30.559
I... I'm from this school too.

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:31.240
Where's your uniform?

00:29:31.799 --> 00:29:32.200
Don't have one.

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:32.920
Fine, fine, fine.

00:29:40.559 --> 00:29:41.400
Zhang... Zhang Chi.

00:29:43.119 --> 00:29:43.720
Brother Xiaocan.

00:29:44.279 --> 00:29:45.240
What are you doing? Not going in?

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:46.480
Let me ask you something.

00:29:46.559 --> 00:29:46.880
What's up?

00:29:47.079 --> 00:29:48.079
We're neighbors, right?

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:49.480
Lend me your uniform.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:50.319
I'll return it in a bit.

00:29:50.359 --> 00:29:50.960
You really want to wear it?

00:29:51.039 --> 00:29:51.319
Yeah.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:52.240
You really want to wear it?

00:29:52.279 --> 00:29:53.319
Is it convenient for you?

00:29:53.319 --> 00:29:54.240
If it's not convenient, then...

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.119
Sorry to trouble you. Thanks, bro! Thanks, bro! Thank you!

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:56.920
No, I... I'll be going now.

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:57.559
Thank you!

00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:58.400
Thanks, bro. Thanks, bro.

00:29:59.240 --> 00:29:59.720
This kid...

00:30:15.519 --> 00:30:16.319
Hello, students.

00:30:17.079 --> 00:30:19.359
I am Mr. Yang from Lezhi Middle School.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.079
Okay.

00:30:22.359 --> 00:30:23.319
As the saying goes...

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.759
If you put in the right effort,

00:30:25.039 --> 00:30:27.000
your grades will rise and never fall.

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.759
Doing problems takes no strength,

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.599
math is just memorization.

00:30:30.599 --> 00:30:31.319
Good.

00:30:32.759 --> 00:30:34.480
Recite the trig formulas with me.

00:30:34.759 --> 00:30:37.400
We'll recite along with you.

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.839
sin(pi/2 - alpha)

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.480
= cos(alpha)

00:30:42.799 --> 00:30:45.039
cos(pi/2 - alpha)

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.440
= sin(alpha)

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.039
Odd changes, even stays the same.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.000
Check the quadrant for the sign.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:52.160
Very good.

00:30:52.519 --> 00:30:53.799
Now, let's welcome

00:30:53.839 --> 00:30:55.759
Crazy Math's star student,

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.680
Wei Mingtian.

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.279
I guarantee everyone

00:31:05.559 --> 00:31:06.279
after taking the class,

00:31:06.279 --> 00:31:08.160
your math grades will improve by leaps and bounds.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.440
Good

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.759
Next, students who want to take the class

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.799
can come here to get free textbooks.

00:31:17.039 --> 00:31:18.240
Mom, Mom, Mom.

00:31:18.559 --> 00:31:19.640
Who are you? No, who are you?

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:21.960
Let's go.

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:22.359
Mom, no.

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:22.839
Kong Guifang.

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:23.839
Don't take it.

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.000
There's no room at home.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:25.680
We have several sets already.

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:26.319
Keep it down.

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:26.759
Don't.

00:31:27.359 --> 00:31:28.279
Mom, no, Kong Guifang.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.920
Mom, Mom, Mom.

00:31:32.359 --> 00:31:33.160
Help yourself.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.799
You think I can't find you just because you skip school?

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.240
Thing is, I love skipping school too.

00:31:39.279 --> 00:31:39.640
Brother Lei.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:40.920
I brought the guy.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:42.799
Who is this?

00:31:43.079 --> 00:31:44.119
It's Zhang Chi.

00:31:47.279 --> 00:31:48.839
This is the real Zhang Chi.

00:31:49.119 --> 00:31:49.480
Look.

00:31:49.759 --> 00:31:50.079
Don't touch.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.720
Don't touch. Doesn't Zhang Chi have a pig head on his back?

00:31:52.599 --> 00:31:53.359
Sorry, buddy.

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:54.480
Wrong person. You can go.

00:31:55.799 --> 00:31:56.319
Sorry.

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:57.720
Sorry.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:00.319
Zhang Chi.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:01.559
Brother Xiaocan.

00:32:01.839 --> 00:32:02.440
Getting bullied?

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.119
No, no.

00:32:04.559 --> 00:32:05.559
This idiot, still smiling.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:06.200
Let's go.

00:32:06.599 --> 00:32:07.000
Come with me.

00:32:07.599 --> 00:32:08.440
You can go.

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:09.480
But leave Zhang Chi here.

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.440
Trying to play school bully with me?

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.720
Kids, let me tell you.

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:18.200
I've been bullied since I was...

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.000
Today I can't let...

00:32:21.079 --> 00:32:21.519
Zhang Chi.

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:23.880
I've got your back this time.

00:32:26.559 --> 00:32:27.200
What's the deal?

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:32.640
You touch me again.

00:32:33.359 --> 00:32:34.279
I'll touch you right back.

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.000
You try that again.

00:32:37.079 --> 00:32:37.960
I'll do it.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.200
Okay, okay, okay.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.880
Fine, fine, fine.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.200
You forced me.

00:32:49.559 --> 00:32:50.559
I came prepared.

00:32:51.799 --> 00:32:53.440
Get this on your hair, your clothes,

00:32:53.519 --> 00:32:55.559
I tell you, your mom will kill you when you get home.

00:32:56.039 --> 00:32:56.519
It's super messy.

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:01.240
Dirty.

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:02.000
Right? We...

00:33:03.359 --> 00:33:03.880
Got any more?

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.119
I still have some.

00:33:05.559 --> 00:33:06.640
Let's see what you got.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.400
Fine, you really want to fight, huh?

00:33:09.359 --> 00:33:09.799
Stop it.

00:33:14.079 --> 00:33:15.759
A bunch of good-for-nothings.

00:33:16.039 --> 00:33:16.880
Bullying people here.

00:33:17.559 --> 00:33:18.359
And you, Zhang Chi.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.559
Skipping class to fool around here.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.039
Kong Xiaocan.

00:33:24.039 --> 00:33:25.319
Can't even give me peace in my dreams.

00:33:25.319 --> 00:33:26.079
Listen to me, it's not me.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:26.599
It's got nothing to...

00:33:26.599 --> 00:33:27.640
I'll deal with you when I wake up.

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:28.400
It has nothing to do with me. Go to class.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:29.079
Don't touch me.

00:33:29.079 --> 00:33:29.640
Wait a minute.

00:33:32.839 --> 00:33:33.839
Who said you could leave?

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:35.359
In my dream...

00:33:35.359 --> 00:33:37.200
You think I'd let you bully me?

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:37.799
What do you want?

00:33:38.079 --> 00:33:38.680
A real fight?

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:47.639
Darn it.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:49.599
It hurts.

00:34:50.679 --> 00:34:52.199
The dream is ending.

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:52.760
Oh my god.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:53.920
Mom.
