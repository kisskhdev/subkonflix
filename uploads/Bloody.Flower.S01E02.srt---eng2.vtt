Mom!

00:01:04.967 --> 00:01:06.797
Moon Se Guk lied,

00:01:08.867 --> 00:01:09.967
but as for me,

00:01:11.437 --> 00:01:13.037
I can cure Min Seo's illness.

00:01:13.977 --> 00:01:15.237
Every single one of them...

00:01:16.807 --> 00:01:18.147
was treated by me.

00:01:22.617 --> 00:01:24.187
You must be hungry.
Come on, let's go inside.

00:01:24.247 --> 00:01:26.117
Mom, can we make a quick stop
at the convenience store first?

00:01:26.417 --> 00:01:27.687
There's something I'm really craving.

00:01:28.217 --> 00:01:30.557
Gosh. Fine. Let's go.

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:34.097
Excuse me?

00:01:35.527 --> 00:01:37.867
Are you Kang Sang Woo?

00:01:38.897 --> 00:01:41.297
Yes, that's me.

00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:43.367
You are?

00:01:50.507 --> 00:01:51.607
Who are you?

00:01:54.317 --> 00:01:56.117

(Prosecution)

00:02:42.627 --> 00:02:44.697
This is Cha Yi Yeon
from Violent Crimes Unit One.

00:02:46.197 --> 00:02:49.767
I'll cut to the chase.
We've found all the victims' bodies.

00:02:51.937 --> 00:02:56.207
But to be blunt, we didn't find them.
Lee Woo Gyeom confessed.

00:02:56.747 --> 00:02:58.947
Where did you dump the remaining victims?

00:02:59.317 --> 00:03:00.877
On the mid-slope of Mount Cheonggye,

00:03:00.877 --> 00:03:03.217
facing the river,
at the 100-meter mark.

00:03:03.717 --> 00:03:05.087
Is he trying to get a reduced sentence?

00:03:05.487 --> 00:03:08.257
Yes. He asked me about a plea bargain.

00:03:08.587 --> 00:03:10.487
I don't want a lighter sentence.

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:12.327
I want to make a different kind of deal.

00:03:13.127 --> 00:03:17.627
To this day, the number of victims,
their identities, the body locations...

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:20.367
He's never given a straight answer
about any of it.

00:03:20.897 --> 00:03:23.437
He's toying with us even as we speak.

00:03:24.267 --> 00:03:26.007
He has no regard for human life,

00:03:26.677 --> 00:03:28.577
He's deceiving the entire nation watching,

00:03:29.547 --> 00:03:31.607
all while looking down on us from above.

00:03:32.317 --> 00:03:35.047
So what's your point?

00:03:37.017 --> 00:03:38.917
Now it's your turn to cross the line,
Prosecutor Cha.

00:03:39.817 --> 00:03:41.317
Come over to my side.

00:03:41.617 --> 00:03:43.657
I will personally show you in court.

How I can save a life
without so much as a scalpel.

00:03:48.757 --> 00:03:50.797
You crazy punk...

00:03:53.797 --> 00:03:56.207
We will be seeking the death penalty.

You seem more at ease today.

00:04:08.577 --> 00:04:10.447
I just came from seeing Sang Woo.

00:04:11.047 --> 00:04:12.517
That's just like you, Attorney Park.

00:04:13.787 --> 00:04:14.857
What do you mean? "Just like me?"

00:04:16.527 --> 00:04:17.857
You think you know me?

00:04:18.427 --> 00:04:22.727
That you're a good father
who loves Min Seo more than anything...

00:04:22.797 --> 00:04:25.997
Don't talk so casually about my daughter.

00:04:26.667 --> 00:04:28.697
Gosh, it was a compliment.
That's a little harsh.

00:04:29.567 --> 00:04:32.307
Did you really cure Sang Woo?

00:04:32.977 --> 00:04:34.107
Didn't you see him walking?

00:04:36.977 --> 00:04:39.877
That Sang Woo was cured because of you.
That's something I...

00:04:41.217 --> 00:04:42.217
How am I supposed to believe that?

00:04:43.117 --> 00:04:44.117
Good.

00:04:45.387 --> 00:04:46.987
You should keep doubting me.

00:04:47.687 --> 00:04:49.957
That's the only way
you'll want to see the real thing.

00:04:52.397 --> 00:04:53.497
Attorney Park,

00:04:55.457 --> 00:04:58.127
when people come back from the dead,

00:04:58.897 --> 00:05:01.097
they come to realize
more than what meets the eye.

00:05:02.307 --> 00:05:04.967
I was in a coma for three years
after a car accident.

00:05:13.117 --> 00:05:14.777
I had no idea how I woke up,

00:05:15.347 --> 00:05:17.847
much less why.

00:05:19.387 --> 00:05:23.257
My doctor said I had a new blood mutation,

00:05:25.697 --> 00:05:27.527
but I couldn't just take his word for it.

00:05:28.527 --> 00:05:31.097
I was just an ordinary med student
back then.

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:36.237
But there was another problem.

00:05:38.637 --> 00:05:40.037
As an aftereffect of the accident,

00:05:41.577 --> 00:05:43.647
waves of pain would hit me out of nowhere.

00:05:48.277 --> 00:05:51.047
The exact same pain
I felt during the car crash.

00:05:57.327 --> 00:05:58.957
I couldn't find the cause.

00:06:00.897 --> 00:06:02.827
So, since I was living
on borrowed time anyway,

00:06:03.767 --> 00:06:05.527
I started experimenting on my own body.

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:10.437
I did all sorts of crazy things,
not caring if I died.

00:06:12.267 --> 00:06:14.707
I injected myself with anything
that could possibly be a cure.

00:06:20.477 --> 00:06:21.577
But then one day,

00:06:22.687 --> 00:06:24.147
the pain was gone.

00:06:25.217 --> 00:06:27.717
I had created a cure
for an incurable disease.

00:06:28.257 --> 00:06:30.587
For the very disease that
they said was untreatable.

00:06:31.727 --> 00:06:35.457
The pain, the aftereffects of the coma...
They were all gone.

00:06:37.967 --> 00:06:41.137
You're saying you found a cure?

00:06:42.067 --> 00:06:45.977
Yes. And I realized that method
could be used to cure other diseases too.

00:06:48.837 --> 00:06:49.947
You can really...

00:06:51.007 --> 00:06:52.477
You can cure the Batten disease,
can't you?

00:07:01.557 --> 00:07:03.357
No one believed me at first.

00:07:06.627 --> 00:07:08.257
But they all survived,

00:07:09.127 --> 00:07:11.427
and every single person who woke up
was grateful to me.

00:07:14.397 --> 00:07:15.667
Life and death...

00:07:17.037 --> 00:07:18.437
It's nothing to me.

00:07:23.847 --> 00:07:25.407
(Court)

00:07:25.477 --> 00:07:28.617
- Bring back the death penalty!
- Bring it back!

00:07:28.677 --> 00:07:31.587
- Bring it back!
- Harsh punishment for violent criminals!

00:07:31.647 --> 00:07:33.787
- Punish them!
- Punish them!

00:07:33.817 --> 00:07:36.127
- That's Lee Woo Gyeom!
- Murderer! Killer!

00:07:36.227 --> 00:07:37.727
- Killer!
- Murderer!

00:07:39.057 --> 00:07:43.267
- Lee Woo Gyeom, you murderer!
- Hey, killer!

00:07:44.267 --> 00:07:47.237
- Bring back the death penalty!
- Bring it back!

00:07:47.297 --> 00:07:49.567
Following the arrest of
serial killer Lee Woo Gyeom,

00:07:49.607 --> 00:07:53.637
public support for resuming executions
has been rising dramatically.

00:07:54.037 --> 00:07:55.277
According to a recent poll,

00:07:55.277 --> 00:07:57.807
a staggering 74.3 percent
of respondents said...

00:07:57.907 --> 00:08:01.247
they were in favor of resuming executions.

00:08:01.547 --> 00:08:03.847
Meanwhile, the attorney
handling Lee Woo Gyeom's trial,

00:08:03.917 --> 00:08:07.317
Park Han Jun,
is also facing continued controversy.

00:08:07.857 --> 00:08:09.727
Attorney Park was
formerly a prosecutor for...

00:08:09.727 --> 00:08:11.027
the Central Investigation Department...

00:08:11.087 --> 00:08:13.757
before becoming a civil rights attorney.
However, in recent years...

00:08:23.767 --> 00:08:27.377
The defendant killed 17 people.
Is that correct?

00:08:27.777 --> 00:08:28.777
Yes.

00:08:29.037 --> 00:08:32.177
And you claim you killed them
while experimenting to create a cure?

00:08:32.617 --> 00:08:35.377
- Yes, that's correct.
- Assuming your claim is true,

00:08:35.917 --> 00:08:38.147
the process
in which 17 people were killed.

00:08:38.547 --> 00:08:42.287
- Where are the records of that research?
- Your Honor.

00:08:42.957 --> 00:08:48.397
The records in Exhibit 23 contain
the research on the 17 victims.

00:08:48.627 --> 00:08:49.667
Your Honor.

00:08:50.167 --> 00:08:54.067
However, the victims' bodies
are so severely mutilated...

00:08:54.197 --> 00:08:58.167
that the National Forensic Service reports
they can't confirm their identities.

00:08:59.277 --> 00:09:00.307
(Prosecution)

00:09:10.247 --> 00:09:11.247
Defendant!

00:09:12.117 --> 00:09:16.727
If your goal was research,
why dismember the victims so brutally?

00:09:16.857 --> 00:09:19.087
If your goal was truly research, then why!

00:09:19.997 --> 00:09:24.067
Why did Hong Jae Gwang have to be murdered
and left in such a wretched state?

00:09:28.837 --> 00:09:30.867
(Defendant)

00:09:33.507 --> 00:09:34.507
Your Honor.

00:09:35.177 --> 00:09:37.807
If the defendant's true intention
was research,

00:09:38.907 --> 00:09:43.387
would he have needed to desecrate
the victims' bodies to such an extent?

00:09:44.217 --> 00:09:45.217
How interesting.

00:09:45.687 --> 00:09:47.457
Therefore, we contend that this case...

00:09:48.117 --> 00:09:50.887
is just a series of thrill kills
by a psychopathic murderer.

00:09:50.957 --> 00:09:51.957
Your Honor.

00:09:53.227 --> 00:09:55.357
The prosecution's assertion
of "thrill kills" is...

00:09:55.857 --> 00:09:58.727
merely an emotional argument
with no evidence whatsoever.

00:09:59.167 --> 00:10:02.567
Sustained.
Prosecutor, do you have any grounds?

00:10:02.937 --> 00:10:05.267
Yes. I'll present them now.

00:10:07.307 --> 00:10:08.307
Defendant.

00:10:10.277 --> 00:10:11.707
You're familiar with
Jo Gyeong Chan, correct?

00:10:12.047 --> 00:10:13.047
Yes.

00:10:13.117 --> 00:10:16.917
Five years ago, you were hit by a car
driven by Jo Gyeong Chan,

00:10:17.347 --> 00:10:22.057
which left you in a coma for three years.
How did you feel about that?

00:10:22.627 --> 00:10:23.727
You must have been angry, right?

00:10:24.557 --> 00:10:28.157
Resentful that this happened to you.
And over time,

00:10:29.027 --> 00:10:31.027
towards the person responsible
for the accident,

00:10:32.067 --> 00:10:34.067
you must have felt anger
and a desire for revenge.

00:10:34.497 --> 00:10:36.567
- That's not true.
- It's not?

00:10:36.637 --> 00:10:37.637
No, it is not.

00:10:37.707 --> 00:10:40.177
Then why did you seek out
and murder Jo Gyeong Chan?

00:10:40.477 --> 00:10:41.507
Jo Gyeong Chan?

00:11:12.007 --> 00:11:14.707
Your Honor. The defendant's crimes...

00:11:15.337 --> 00:11:18.777
were premeditated murders born
from anger and a desire for revenge.

00:11:19.077 --> 00:11:22.917
He targeted adults whose disappearances
were unlikely to be investigated,

00:11:22.987 --> 00:11:26.817
making this a clear case
of calculated serial murder.

00:11:27.357 --> 00:11:29.957
I submit their traffic accident record
as evidence.

00:11:29.957 --> 00:11:32.587
The accident between the defendant
and the victim, Jo Gyeong Chan,

00:11:48.307 --> 00:11:51.207
- Look at him.
- Darn... He's a monster.

00:11:52.347 --> 00:11:53.347
Stop provoking them.

00:11:53.647 --> 00:11:55.747
I'm not provoking them. It's just absurd.

00:11:56.987 --> 00:11:59.087
- Look at him. My goodness.
- Order!

00:11:59.457 --> 00:12:01.087
I will have you removed
from the courtroom if not.

00:12:02.417 --> 00:12:04.387
(Defendant)

00:12:07.027 --> 00:12:09.127
Counsel for the defense, your rebuttal.

00:12:10.027 --> 00:12:12.737
(Defense Counsel)

00:12:13.367 --> 00:12:14.367
Your Honor.

00:12:16.507 --> 00:12:17.867
The prosecution's argument...

00:12:19.537 --> 00:12:20.737
does have some merit.

00:12:21.477 --> 00:12:25.247
And that's because you have yet to hear
the details of how my client...

00:12:25.647 --> 00:12:27.577
performed his treatments.

00:12:29.987 --> 00:12:33.387
Are you saying you can explain
the treatment process?

00:12:34.117 --> 00:12:35.217
I won't just explain it.

00:12:36.887 --> 00:12:40.097
I'll show you firsthand.

00:12:43.367 --> 00:12:47.697
I would like to call as witnesses
the six terminally ill patients...

00:12:49.437 --> 00:12:50.737
whom the defendant claims to have cured.

00:13:00.817 --> 00:13:02.017
So who are the witnesses?

00:13:04.647 --> 00:13:05.747
I still have to find them.

00:13:06.187 --> 00:13:07.187
What?

00:13:07.687 --> 00:13:09.257
So you were just bluffing?

00:13:09.927 --> 00:13:11.487
I had to shift the momentum of the trial.

00:13:11.827 --> 00:13:14.297
It was leaning in Prosecutor Cha's favor
from the start.

00:13:17.697 --> 00:13:19.967
You make it sound like it's my fault.

00:13:20.337 --> 00:13:21.567
That's because it is.

00:13:22.467 --> 00:13:25.467
Why did you have to mutilate
the bodies like that?

00:13:26.137 --> 00:13:28.677
You only call it "mutilation"
because you see it as murder.

00:13:29.647 --> 00:13:31.777
"Why are you dissecting a frog
so cruelly?"

00:13:32.107 --> 00:13:33.647
That's the exact same question.

00:13:34.047 --> 00:13:35.117
But Hong Jae Gwang was different.

00:13:35.417 --> 00:13:37.547
Because the experiment with him
was a success.

00:13:38.887 --> 00:13:41.857
So you drained all of his blood?

00:13:41.957 --> 00:13:45.527
Yes, that's when I figured out
how to create the cure.

00:13:50.827 --> 00:13:52.227
To you, when it comes to your experiments,

00:13:53.397 --> 00:13:55.067
murder is just part of the process.

00:13:58.637 --> 00:14:02.307
If Hong Jae Gwang's experiment failed,
you wouldn't have stopped at 17, right?

00:14:03.007 --> 00:14:04.407
Just be honest with me.

00:14:05.547 --> 00:14:06.647
Stop lying.

00:14:07.117 --> 00:14:09.847
- Lie about what?
- Because you wanted to kill him.

00:14:11.117 --> 00:14:12.117
That's why you killed him.

00:14:13.017 --> 00:14:16.257
That's why you killed
Jo Gyeong Chan first, isn't it?

00:14:17.627 --> 00:14:19.927
Be honest with me about your motive,

00:14:21.097 --> 00:14:25.067
and let's focus on proving your ability.
If you're caught lying in court,

00:14:25.997 --> 00:14:27.097
you won't escape the death penalty.

00:14:27.497 --> 00:14:28.667
I don't care.

00:14:29.267 --> 00:14:31.267
They won't execute me anyway.

00:14:32.137 --> 00:14:37.077
Besides, would they really execute someone
who can cure the terminally ill?

00:14:40.217 --> 00:14:41.217
That's only...

00:14:43.017 --> 00:14:45.087
if your treatment is recognized.
Only if it's recognized.

00:14:47.717 --> 00:14:48.787
That's why...

00:14:49.657 --> 00:14:52.727
I need you to get my ability recognized
through this trial.

00:14:52.827 --> 00:14:54.627
Get those witnesses to testify too.

00:14:55.697 --> 00:14:58.027
That's the only way to treat Min Seo,
right?

Do you really have to
take the Lee Woo Gyeom case?

It's not too late. Please, just drop it.

00:15:26.697 --> 00:15:28.597
I'll try to persuade the director again.

00:15:28.857 --> 00:15:29.897
It's fine.

00:15:32.497 --> 00:15:35.797
How is this fine?
You're not thinking straight.

00:15:36.197 --> 00:15:38.767
Why on earth would you agree
to defend a serial killer?

00:15:39.167 --> 00:15:40.707
If you become the public's punching bag,

00:15:41.007 --> 00:15:43.747
- what kind of client would hire you?
- I have to do this.

00:15:43.947 --> 00:15:44.947
But why?

00:15:45.777 --> 00:15:47.077
Why does it have to be you?

00:15:48.377 --> 00:15:50.387
It's a case I have to take.

Reporter Jo, it's me.
My GPS can't seem to find the place.

00:16:26.757 --> 00:16:30.657
The roads around here are a real maze,
so it's hard to find.

00:16:31.027 --> 00:16:32.057
What do you see around you?

- Really?

00:16:45.807 --> 00:16:49.107
- I see you.
- Yes. Just keep coming straight up.

You're here, Attorney Park.

00:17:06.727 --> 00:17:08.827
Man, you must've had a hard time
getting here.

No, I'm good.

00:17:36.757 --> 00:17:37.827
Come on, at least let me...

00:17:59.877 --> 00:18:01.347
Here, have a nice, cold glass.

00:18:02.977 --> 00:18:04.417
Don't worry, the water's clean.

If six witnesses claim Lee Woo Gyeom
cured their incurable diseases,

00:18:14.327 --> 00:18:16.197
do you think the court will see
the case a little differently?

00:18:16.827 --> 00:18:18.267
They'd have to.

00:18:18.667 --> 00:18:20.737
It would completely change
the motive for the murders.

00:18:23.337 --> 00:18:24.367
Yes.

00:18:25.167 --> 00:18:26.407
Right.

About Lee Woo Gyeom,

00:18:29.677 --> 00:18:31.307
I heard they're moving him
to solitary confinement.

00:18:32.547 --> 00:18:35.317
It's just a psychological tactic
to corner him.

00:18:36.417 --> 00:18:38.617
This puts us at a disadvantage
in so many ways.

00:18:42.717 --> 00:18:43.757
Reporter Jo.

00:18:44.487 --> 00:18:45.527
Yes?

00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:49.697

(Why Prosecution Ignores the Truth?)

00:18:57.007 --> 00:18:58.437
It's a reporter named Jo Woo Cheol.

00:18:58.767 --> 00:19:01.207
He's the one who's clashed with
the financial crimes unit before.

00:19:02.007 --> 00:19:03.977
Can't you shut him up?

00:19:05.177 --> 00:19:07.247
We don't need to respond
to this kind of tabloid trash.

00:19:07.317 --> 00:19:09.347
I'm telling you.
He's working with Attorney Park.

00:19:10.247 --> 00:19:11.617
With Attorney Park Han Jun?

00:19:11.947 --> 00:19:13.987
This is exactly why I can't relax.

to every little detail.

00:19:21.757 --> 00:19:24.327

understand?

and I'll handle it with no loose ends.

00:19:53.527 --> 00:19:56.827
Yes, of course. The director is back.

- He's got killer looks.
- Hey, new guy. Don't stare like that.

00:20:38.537 --> 00:20:41.707

00:20:46.307 --> 00:20:47.847

It must have been the increased dosage.

That drug was only tested on adults.

00:22:00.957 --> 00:22:03.387
It could be dangerous
for children like Min Seo.

00:22:04.727 --> 00:22:05.727
But still,

00:22:06.227 --> 00:22:08.197
we can't just go through
the same thing day after day.

00:22:08.927 --> 00:22:12.467
Doing the same thing over and over
is what's keeping our Min Seo alive.

I think about our Min Seo all the time.

00:22:30.747 --> 00:22:32.947
They said no other patient has held on
as long as our Min Seo has.

00:22:34.317 --> 00:22:36.157
We've done so well up to now,

00:22:37.657 --> 00:22:39.257
so our Min Seo will be fine.

00:22:40.297 --> 00:22:41.297

Appearing in court...

00:22:57.947 --> 00:22:59.107

by a murderer, what will they think?

Also, all six patients treated
by Lee Woo Gyeom are refusing to testify.

If we want to bring them in,
we might have to subpoena them.

00:23:57.267 --> 00:24:00.107
No, absolutely not. If we do that,

00:24:01.007 --> 00:24:03.477
we might not get the testimony we need.

00:24:05.307 --> 00:24:07.717

- We just have to keep...

- He's not with any crew.

Once their treatment is over, that's it.

00:25:44.247 --> 00:25:45.247
I see.

00:25:47.347 --> 00:25:48.747
But it must be nice to be Min Seo.

00:25:49.617 --> 00:25:51.517
Having a father who only cares about her.

00:25:51.887 --> 00:25:53.147
Focus on your case.

00:25:56.087 --> 00:25:57.087
Alright, then.

00:25:58.557 --> 00:26:02.057
Don't you have some kind of record
of how you treated them?

00:26:02.757 --> 00:26:04.727
- Of course I do.
- You do?

00:26:06.467 --> 00:26:10.097
But the witnesses have to testify
for the court to admit them as evidence.

00:26:11.007 --> 00:26:15.007
Since the witnesses can't testify now,
just submitting those records...

00:26:15.677 --> 00:26:16.977
is our best shot.

00:26:19.677 --> 00:26:23.447
If you go to my study,
there should be a red notebook.

00:26:23.747 --> 00:26:25.187
That's my research log.

00:26:26.217 --> 00:26:28.317
But I'm pretty sure
the police have already taken it.

00:26:28.617 --> 00:26:29.617
They did?

00:27:40.127 --> 00:27:42.027
"Human Clinical Trial Results."

00:27:42.097 --> 00:27:43.397
(Oh Min Gyu, Male, Batten Disease)

00:27:43.457 --> 00:27:44.467
Batten Disease.

00:27:45.497 --> 00:27:47.067
(Oh Min Gyu, 25 years old,
Recovered Batten disease)

00:28:01.477 --> 00:28:02.477
Hey!

00:28:03.417 --> 00:28:04.417
Stop right there.

00:28:06.687 --> 00:28:07.817
I said stop!

00:28:41.987 --> 00:28:45.087
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.
Please, just let me go.

00:28:46.957 --> 00:28:49.527
Hey everyone, this is legit the place
where Lee Woo Gyeom...

00:28:49.597 --> 00:28:52.627
dismembered his victim. Check this out.

00:28:53.937 --> 00:28:55.367
- Hey.
- The vibe in here is insane, right?

00:28:55.437 --> 00:28:57.967
Is this that "dare challenge"
that's going around?

00:28:58.307 --> 00:29:00.807
Yes. If this video blows up,
I can get ad revenue.

00:29:00.807 --> 00:29:04.307
- And the top guys make over a grand.
- Okay, I get it. Hey, Attorney Park.

00:29:05.007 --> 00:29:08.917
As you know,
we can't guard the scene 24 hours a day.

00:29:08.977 --> 00:29:10.017
And besides,

00:29:10.547 --> 00:29:13.417
this is on the kid who crossed the tape,
right?

00:29:13.487 --> 00:29:14.657
Yes, I'm sorry.

00:29:15.817 --> 00:29:16.817
You.

00:29:18.487 --> 00:29:19.727
Listen to me carefully.

00:29:20.327 --> 00:29:23.257
If you lie, you could be charged
with trespassing and obstructing justice,

00:29:23.427 --> 00:29:24.697
which means up to three years in prison...

00:29:24.967 --> 00:29:26.867
and a fine of up to five grand.
Understand?

00:29:29.967 --> 00:29:31.107
Tell me the truth.

00:29:31.967 --> 00:29:33.067
Did you go inside...

00:29:34.277 --> 00:29:35.637
or not?

00:29:37.077 --> 00:29:38.807
I swear I only filmed nearby.

00:29:38.877 --> 00:29:40.547
Besides, the doors were all locked.

00:29:40.877 --> 00:29:42.977
So you tried the doors, didn't you?

00:29:43.177 --> 00:29:44.947
You can't lie about this.
If you lie, you'll be in huge trouble.

00:29:45.017 --> 00:29:47.287
- You hear me?
- I'm sorry.

00:29:47.987 --> 00:29:49.217
I'm really sorry.

00:29:50.257 --> 00:29:51.427
I'll delete everything, I swear.

00:29:51.487 --> 00:29:52.857
- I'm really...
- Tell me the truth!

00:29:52.927 --> 00:29:53.927
Yes... I opened it.

00:29:54.297 --> 00:29:56.797
(Court)

00:30:05.007 --> 00:30:06.007
You're here early.

00:30:14.617 --> 00:30:15.617
We keep running into each other.

00:30:16.517 --> 00:30:18.447
I thought we were on opposite sides.

00:30:22.387 --> 00:30:24.657
How's Chief Oh doing?

00:30:25.427 --> 00:30:26.427
You mean Chief Oh?

00:30:26.957 --> 00:30:28.427
Back when I was on the bench,

00:30:29.027 --> 00:30:31.097
everyone was in an uproar
about some hothead who had just joined,

00:30:32.567 --> 00:30:34.467
and he told me he was the one
who took you under his wing.

00:30:35.067 --> 00:30:38.607
You mean the troublemaker,
the top student at the Training Institute?

00:30:39.467 --> 00:30:40.977
You should worry less
about other people...

00:30:41.407 --> 00:30:43.077
and more about the murderer
you're defending.

00:30:46.507 --> 00:30:47.517
Hello.

00:30:52.047 --> 00:30:53.147
I know you're all very busy,

00:30:53.747 --> 00:30:55.287
so I appreciate your cooperation.

00:30:56.987 --> 00:30:59.387
The defense witness will be present,

00:31:00.127 --> 00:31:01.797
- correct?
- Yes.

00:31:02.897 --> 00:31:03.897
That is correct.

00:31:05.297 --> 00:31:09.437
At the next hearing,
based on the witnesses' testimonies,

00:31:09.667 --> 00:31:12.367
we'll determine if the crime's motive
was truly to heal people or not.

00:31:12.737 --> 00:31:14.337
We will examine that closely.

00:31:14.537 --> 00:31:15.907
A change in motive...

00:31:16.437 --> 00:31:19.707
- won't change the outcome of this case.
- But the sentencing guidelines...

00:31:20.717 --> 00:31:21.717
could change, though.

00:31:23.117 --> 00:31:24.117
Look,

00:31:25.487 --> 00:31:27.587
he killed 17 people.

00:31:28.887 --> 00:31:30.117
Let's not do this here.

00:31:30.957 --> 00:31:32.157
Save it for the courtroom.

00:31:38.567 --> 00:31:40.327
You saw Reporter Jo's article, didn't you?

00:31:41.067 --> 00:31:42.497
Seemed pretty accurate to me.

00:31:43.497 --> 00:31:45.537
And what part of it is supposedly factual?

00:31:46.507 --> 00:31:47.507
Why?

00:31:48.777 --> 00:31:51.407
If it's not true, then prove it.

00:31:52.077 --> 00:31:54.047
Stop whining about it like a child.

00:31:54.947 --> 00:31:55.947
A child?

00:31:58.287 --> 00:32:02.857
You were my student once.
So you still seem like one to me.

00:32:05.727 --> 00:32:06.857
(Reporter Jo Woo Cheol, Daehan Daily)

00:32:07.087 --> 00:32:09.027
Give my regards to Reporter Jo.

00:32:09.697 --> 00:32:10.697
I'll be on my way.

00:32:10.767 --> 00:32:12.767
(Criminal Court, Civil Petitions Office)

00:32:15.137 --> 00:32:16.137
Hey, Reporter Jo, it's me.

00:32:16.137 --> 00:32:18.867
- Attorney Park, we have a huge problem.
- What?

00:32:19.137 --> 00:32:21.877
They're raiding the office right now!
It's total chaos!

00:32:26.847 --> 00:32:29.217
I'm almost there. I can see the office.
Hang on.

00:32:29.347 --> 00:32:33.957
No, they say my article is defamation,
violates the Comms Network Act,

00:32:34.017 --> 00:32:37.187
and is an obstruction of justice.
Can they really raid an office for this?

00:32:40.357 --> 00:32:44.797
We know you're in there!
Open up before we break the door down!

00:32:51.537 --> 00:32:53.567
They're breaking the door. They broke it!
They're in!

00:32:53.567 --> 00:32:55.537
Please hurry... Hey, wait a minute!
Hold on!

00:32:55.637 --> 00:32:58.207
Hey, what do you think you're doing?
You don't even have a warrant!

00:32:59.177 --> 00:33:00.377
Please cooperate.

00:33:00.677 --> 00:33:02.717
Let's just get this over with
quickly and painlessly.

00:33:03.417 --> 00:33:05.787
Look who it is.
You should've just opened the door.

00:33:06.117 --> 00:33:09.687
- I was on the phone.
- Hey! Hold on a minute!

00:33:10.487 --> 00:33:11.487
Hold on, everyone.

00:33:13.657 --> 00:33:15.697
Let me see the search warrant.

00:33:19.767 --> 00:33:21.367
This is all by the book.

00:33:22.267 --> 00:33:23.897
If we go back to Prosecutor Cha
empty-handed...

00:33:24.937 --> 00:33:26.067
So just step aside, please.

00:33:31.707 --> 00:33:32.707
Go ahead.

00:33:35.147 --> 00:33:37.317
What are you doing here anyway?

00:33:39.917 --> 00:33:41.157
But hold on a second!

00:33:43.517 --> 00:33:44.687
Everyone, just stop for a second.

00:33:46.127 --> 00:33:47.127
I...

00:33:48.227 --> 00:33:51.227
happen to share this office space.

00:33:52.267 --> 00:33:53.527
So anything that belongs to me...

00:33:54.667 --> 00:33:57.197
is absolutely off-limits. Understood?

00:34:01.237 --> 00:34:04.107
Sir, isn't this your desk?

00:34:05.547 --> 00:34:07.477
Your business cards are right here.

00:34:07.847 --> 00:34:08.847
About that...

00:34:11.547 --> 00:34:12.547
I put them in the wrong spot.

00:34:15.117 --> 00:34:17.317
This is my desk right here.

00:34:18.687 --> 00:34:21.497
Yes. That's right.
That's actually my desk.

00:34:21.597 --> 00:34:22.797
Yes, go ahead and take it.

00:34:23.597 --> 00:34:27.667
Sir, you're making this difficult.
This is clear obstruction of justice.

00:34:27.897 --> 00:34:31.167
Fine, then. Take whatever you want.

00:34:31.507 --> 00:34:34.577
But just know I'll be suing you
for larceny...

00:34:34.637 --> 00:34:39.147
for illegally taking my property.
We'll see who has the bigger headache.

00:34:40.007 --> 00:34:41.017
Just you wait.

00:34:46.117 --> 00:34:49.157
Man, what a chaotic day.
I thought I was going to lose my mind.

00:34:50.387 --> 00:34:51.657
That was Prosecutor Cha's doing, right?

00:34:52.357 --> 00:34:54.397
I heard she comes from
a pretty powerful family.

00:34:54.997 --> 00:34:56.497
She's the youngest daughter
of Sejin Group, right?

00:34:56.827 --> 00:34:57.827
That's right.

00:34:58.397 --> 00:35:00.967
So what's the bad blood between you two?

00:35:01.667 --> 00:35:03.537
She was my student back when
I taught at the Training Institute.

00:35:05.107 --> 00:35:06.737
But regardless of her family,

00:35:07.307 --> 00:35:09.907
she was the sharpest student
I ever taught...

00:35:11.547 --> 00:35:12.907
and the biggest pain in my neck.

00:35:13.147 --> 00:35:15.817
Gosh. For a student to be that rude
to her teacher...

00:35:17.917 --> 00:35:21.517
Man, today's been a mess.
When I'm stressed, I like to eat.

00:35:22.187 --> 00:35:25.557
Let's get a drink.
Hey, Min Gyeong! Over here!

00:35:26.487 --> 00:35:27.497
Attorney Park.

00:35:29.527 --> 00:35:31.127
- What's this?
- I invited her.

00:35:33.697 --> 00:35:34.897
Have you been well?

00:35:35.497 --> 00:35:36.997
Yes, I've been fine.

00:35:37.937 --> 00:35:39.007
- It's been a while.
- Yes.

00:35:43.307 --> 00:35:45.607
So, are you really not going
to hire me back?

00:35:47.377 --> 00:35:50.177
CEO Heo said Hae Gang will pay my salary,

00:35:50.277 --> 00:35:52.847
and that it's okay for me
to come and help you.

00:35:53.047 --> 00:35:55.457
Just stay at Hae Gang
and keep doing your job there.

00:35:56.257 --> 00:35:57.257
Attorney Park.

00:35:58.887 --> 00:36:02.327
After you left, I wasn't assigned
to a new supervising attorney,

00:36:02.397 --> 00:36:05.127
so all I do every day is make copies.
This has to be better than that.

00:36:05.667 --> 00:36:07.067
Gosh, what are you talking about?

00:36:11.437 --> 00:36:15.307
Attorney Park.
What if we let Min Gyeong here...

00:36:15.707 --> 00:36:17.337
try to meet with a witness?

00:36:17.707 --> 00:36:18.707
The witnesses?

00:36:19.477 --> 00:36:21.377
You haven't secured a witness yet?

00:36:22.117 --> 00:36:23.647
Not yet.

00:36:23.917 --> 00:36:27.757
Since it's a serial murder case,
most witnesses are reluctant to cooperate.

00:36:31.087 --> 00:36:32.657
Then let me give it a try.

00:36:33.157 --> 00:36:34.157
What?

00:36:34.627 --> 00:36:37.427
I happen to be amazing
at getting people on board.

00:36:38.427 --> 00:36:39.897
For example, at my college festival,

00:36:40.127 --> 00:36:43.897
I set up all the lonely students
on group dates,

00:36:44.167 --> 00:36:47.637
and our pop-up bar broke the all-time
school sales record. That was all me.

00:36:50.337 --> 00:36:51.577
But...

00:36:52.007 --> 00:36:55.847
- Recruiting a witness isn't exactly...
- You don't need a certificate for that.

00:36:56.477 --> 00:36:59.547
I don't have a certificate,
but I do have confidence.

00:37:00.347 --> 00:37:04.787
Maybe it's because
we're a couple of dreary faces...

00:37:05.027 --> 00:37:06.787
that it hasn't been working out.

00:37:07.387 --> 00:37:08.927
I know I can do a really good job.

00:37:09.557 --> 00:37:10.557
Please?

00:37:13.327 --> 00:37:15.967
For crying out loud.
What's gotten into you two?

00:37:17.437 --> 00:37:18.767
All right, fine. Then...

00:37:19.207 --> 00:37:23.737
Min Gyeong has no field experience,
so Reporter Jo, show her the ropes.

00:37:23.937 --> 00:37:26.147
Of course. That's my specialty.

00:37:27.307 --> 00:37:29.977
Min Gyeong, looking forward to working
with you. I'm Jo Woo Cheol.

00:37:30.047 --> 00:37:31.487
Hey, I'm just going to speak casually.

00:37:32.117 --> 00:37:33.847
Since you decided
to speak informally first,

00:37:34.787 --> 00:37:35.917
I'll do the same.

00:37:36.817 --> 00:37:39.487
- What?
- I'm just kidding, sir.

00:37:40.357 --> 00:37:43.357
- Well, then, shall we have a drink?
- All right.

00:37:43.627 --> 00:37:45.497
- All right, glasses up.
- Yes.

00:37:45.567 --> 00:37:47.637
- Cheers.
- Good.

00:37:50.737 --> 00:37:53.007
Lee Woo Gyeom will surely pay
for his crimes, right?

00:37:54.137 --> 00:37:56.607
But if it's true that he really cured
an incurable disease...

00:37:57.337 --> 00:37:59.347
so that he can help even more people,

00:37:59.647 --> 00:38:01.177
we have to at least give it a shot,
don't we?

00:38:06.317 --> 00:38:07.317
Ma'am.

00:38:08.117 --> 00:38:12.957
For the other patients and families
who are going through the same pain,

00:38:13.487 --> 00:38:14.497
please,

00:38:15.857 --> 00:38:16.997
I'm begging you.

00:38:19.867 --> 00:38:20.867
I understand.

00:38:22.637 --> 00:38:23.637
I'll testify.

00:38:26.307 --> 00:38:27.507
Thank you, ma'am.

00:38:29.477 --> 00:38:30.477
There's something.

00:38:33.447 --> 00:38:34.617
I received this.

00:38:34.617 --> 00:38:36.247
(From Lee Woo Gyeom)

00:38:47.057 --> 00:38:48.397
(To the sea)

00:38:48.457 --> 00:38:52.597
What in the world is this letter?
Did Mr. Lee Woo Gyeom really write this?

00:38:55.397 --> 00:38:58.767
If word gets out that I was sick,
it'll hurt my reputation at work.

00:38:59.837 --> 00:39:01.277
Please don't worry.

00:39:01.607 --> 00:39:04.137
Information about witnesses
is kept strictly confidential.

00:39:04.447 --> 00:39:06.077
- And we'll...
- But this is going too far.

00:39:06.607 --> 00:39:08.947
You're threatening to leak
my personal information to the press?

00:39:15.657 --> 00:39:20.187
You can promise me that nothing
will happen to my Sang Woo, right?

00:39:20.727 --> 00:39:22.157
Look, I'll agree to testify,

00:39:23.227 --> 00:39:24.397
but I won't be threatened like this.

00:39:25.027 --> 00:39:27.467
I promise I'll do whatever it takes...

00:39:28.037 --> 00:39:31.267
to make sure you're not harmed by this.
I'm counting on you.

00:39:33.907 --> 00:39:36.437
This is the only way
the witnesses will testify.

00:39:36.507 --> 00:39:38.747
Nothing good will come
from provoking the witnesses.

00:39:38.847 --> 00:39:40.607
You have to provoke them
to get a reaction.

00:39:40.807 --> 00:39:44.547
You think all witnesses are on your side?
They could do something unpredictable.

00:39:47.787 --> 00:39:48.787
From now on,

00:39:49.287 --> 00:39:52.027
everything and anything
related to this trial,

00:39:52.787 --> 00:39:53.987
you run by me first.

00:39:54.927 --> 00:39:55.927
Got it?

00:40:06.637 --> 00:40:07.637
Yes.

00:40:13.307 --> 00:40:14.307
Prosecutor Cha.

00:40:14.877 --> 00:40:16.217
Here's the defense's witness list.

00:40:16.477 --> 00:40:17.477
Thank you.

00:40:17.947 --> 00:40:19.487
The mother of a patient
Lee Woo Gyeom saved...

00:40:19.547 --> 00:40:22.017
and an actual patient he treated
are being called as witnesses.

00:40:23.857 --> 00:40:25.287
Polio.

00:40:26.427 --> 00:40:27.427
Blood cancer.

00:40:30.597 --> 00:40:32.397
(Kang Sang Woo, 18 years old,
Congenital incurable polio)

00:40:32.467 --> 00:40:33.467
Kang Sang Woo.

00:40:34.067 --> 00:40:35.367
Incurable polio.

00:40:37.197 --> 00:40:40.067
He had never walked a single step
in his life.

00:40:40.867 --> 00:40:41.877
Right.

00:40:42.307 --> 00:40:46.307
Apparently, at a support group
for families with incurable diseases,

00:40:47.147 --> 00:40:51.077
Sang Woo's mother met Lee Woo Gyeom
by Song Tae Jin's sister.

00:40:52.717 --> 00:40:57.557
Mr. Song had terminal blood cancer,
but he's now been declared fully cured.

00:40:58.087 --> 00:40:59.627
Of the six patients...

00:40:59.627 --> 00:41:00.757
with incurable diseases
that Lee Woo Gyeom treated,

00:41:00.857 --> 00:41:03.127
we've been unable to contact
the other four.

00:41:03.257 --> 00:41:05.927
Let's focus on the confirmed witnesses,
Kang Sang Woo's mother...

00:41:06.227 --> 00:41:07.837
and Mr. Song Tae Jin.

00:41:08.767 --> 00:41:11.407
The court will absolutely want to know...

00:41:11.407 --> 00:41:15.037
how Lee Woo Gyeom treated these people.

00:41:15.037 --> 00:41:17.207
So the question is how, in what way,

00:41:17.777 --> 00:41:19.507
we should disclose that. That's...

00:41:21.047 --> 00:41:22.347
That's the challenge.

00:41:26.387 --> 00:41:27.387
Attorney Park.

00:41:29.587 --> 00:41:32.757
You're worried about that letter he sent
to the witnesses, aren't you?

00:41:33.487 --> 00:41:34.497
Yes.

00:41:35.057 --> 00:41:36.057
The witnesses...

00:41:36.727 --> 00:41:38.467
I didn't want to force them to testify.

00:41:39.567 --> 00:41:42.437
Should we file for a postponement then?

00:41:42.897 --> 00:41:43.897
No, no.

00:41:44.537 --> 00:41:49.137
Given how impulsive Lee Woo Gyeom is,
there's no telling what he might do next.

00:41:50.477 --> 00:41:52.707
Let's find a better option for now.

00:41:53.577 --> 00:41:54.977
And do our absolute best...

00:41:55.977 --> 00:41:56.977
to be prepared.

00:41:57.047 --> 00:42:01.317
Well then, no time like the present.
Let's get right to it, good?

00:42:01.587 --> 00:42:02.587
Sure, sounds good.

00:42:03.017 --> 00:42:05.687
I'd much rather pull an all-nighter
than just be on copy duty.

00:42:05.857 --> 00:42:09.057
So, should I finally show you
what I'm made of?

00:42:28.017 --> 00:42:31.047
- Thanks for all your hard work.
- Good job.

00:42:31.417 --> 00:42:32.417
- Bye.
- See you later.

00:42:45.967 --> 00:42:49.237
Today is the 4th hearing of the 1st trial
of the Lee Woo Gyeom case.

00:42:49.437 --> 00:42:52.437
The focus of this trial
is expected to be...

00:42:52.437 --> 00:42:55.237
on the witnesses' testimony
about the treatment.

00:42:55.837 --> 00:42:57.077
Witness.

00:42:57.077 --> 00:43:01.317
Is it true you entrusted the defendant,
Lee Woo Gyeom,

00:43:01.577 --> 00:43:03.217
with treating your son, Sang Woo,

00:43:04.047 --> 00:43:07.247
- for his polio?
- Yes.

00:43:08.087 --> 00:43:09.157
That's correct.

00:43:09.717 --> 00:43:12.627
Then could you please describe
what happened at that time?

00:43:13.257 --> 00:43:15.597
He came with a bag of medical instruments.

00:43:16.257 --> 00:43:17.257
And...

00:43:18.297 --> 00:43:20.967
he injected what he called a "cure"
into Sang Woo's arm.

00:43:21.197 --> 00:43:24.937
And what were Sang Woo's symptoms
after the injection?

00:43:25.307 --> 00:43:27.367
Sang Woo seemed tired and fell asleep.

00:43:28.437 --> 00:43:29.907
He didn't wake up until dawn.

00:43:30.607 --> 00:43:31.607
How do you...

00:43:32.277 --> 00:43:35.147
- remember that after all this time?
- That morning,

00:43:37.147 --> 00:43:39.547
Sang Woo suddenly cried out and stood up.

00:43:42.087 --> 00:43:43.087
He stood up?

00:43:45.227 --> 00:43:46.727
So that everyone
in this court can hear you,

00:43:48.427 --> 00:43:50.127
please say that again...

00:43:51.057 --> 00:43:52.167
in a loud, clear voice.

00:43:53.497 --> 00:43:54.497
Yes.

00:43:55.437 --> 00:43:56.597
He stood up!

00:44:02.977 --> 00:44:04.207
Could you describe that moment...

00:44:05.847 --> 00:44:07.547
in more detail?

00:44:08.777 --> 00:44:11.447
"Mom! Mom, look at this!"

00:44:12.687 --> 00:44:14.387
That's what he shouted.

00:44:15.217 --> 00:44:18.887
I was shocked and rushed to his room,
and when I got there,

00:44:20.587 --> 00:44:22.797
he was standing on his own two feet.

00:44:25.627 --> 00:44:26.797
That's right.

00:44:27.097 --> 00:44:30.067
Not once in 18 years.

00:44:30.567 --> 00:44:32.467
Sang Woo, who could never stand,

00:44:32.467 --> 00:44:35.537
was standing there,
completely on his own,

00:44:36.037 --> 00:44:38.807
right there in front of the witness.

00:44:39.847 --> 00:44:41.107
Witness,

00:44:41.717 --> 00:44:43.077
that is the truth, is it not?

00:44:43.717 --> 00:44:44.717
Yes.

00:44:45.317 --> 00:44:48.187
- He was standing all on his own.
- And after that,

00:44:48.957 --> 00:44:52.557
did Sang Woo's condition get worse,
or did it not?

00:44:52.787 --> 00:44:53.987
It did not.

00:44:54.487 --> 00:44:56.627
It was as if Sang Woo
had been given a new life.

00:44:57.297 --> 00:44:59.367
He told me how incredibly grateful he was
to Mr. Lee Woo Gyeom.

00:45:01.667 --> 00:45:03.197
He asked me to be sure to tell him that.

00:45:11.407 --> 00:45:12.477
Thank you.

00:45:14.407 --> 00:45:15.817
I have no further questions, Your Honor.

00:45:21.147 --> 00:45:23.657
Prosecutor.
You may begin your cross-examination.

00:45:25.657 --> 00:45:30.297
Witness, how many hospitals gave you
the incurable polio diagnosis for him?

00:45:31.357 --> 00:45:33.127
Around seven, I believe.

00:45:33.297 --> 00:45:36.697
And did you tell each new hospital
of the previous diagnosis?

00:45:37.137 --> 00:45:41.237
Yes. So they'd know
what treatments he'd already had.

00:45:41.307 --> 00:45:42.777
Was that really the reason?

00:45:44.677 --> 00:45:48.947
Your insurance payouts for Sang Woo
were over 80,000 dollars in total.

00:45:49.177 --> 00:45:51.947
Isn't it true
you couldn't risk a different diagnosis?

00:45:52.047 --> 00:45:53.047
Your Honor.

00:45:53.647 --> 00:45:57.387
This line of questioning
is completely irrelevant...

00:45:57.457 --> 00:45:58.887
to the efficacy of the treatment.

00:46:02.127 --> 00:46:04.457
I am trying to establish that
if she intentionally shared the diagnosis,

00:46:04.527 --> 00:46:07.297
even if the incurable polio
was a misdiagnosis,

00:46:07.367 --> 00:46:10.697
the same diagnosis
would simply have been repeated.

00:46:12.007 --> 00:46:14.237
I'll allow it. You may continue.

00:46:22.577 --> 00:46:26.317
I'd like to call Seo Yeong Seok
from the National Forensic Service.

00:46:26.417 --> 00:46:30.617
When a prior diagnosis is shared,
the same mistake is more likely to occur.

00:46:30.917 --> 00:46:33.427
Can't they just ignore
the previous records?

00:46:33.687 --> 00:46:38.597
When you see dozens of patients a day,
it's hard to question the first diagnosis.

00:46:38.667 --> 00:46:40.897
What about in the case of Kang Sang Woo?

00:46:41.697 --> 00:46:44.367
Since there are no recorded cases
of a full recovery from incurable polio,

00:46:44.597 --> 00:46:48.607
- I think Sang Woo had another disease.
- Just a moment.

00:46:49.177 --> 00:46:52.177
- So the diagnosis was a misdiagnosis?
- Yes.

00:46:53.247 --> 00:46:56.577
The disease most often misdiagnosed
as incurable polio...

00:46:57.417 --> 00:46:58.617
is Segawa's disease.

00:47:02.487 --> 00:47:06.187
The two present such similar symptoms
that even doctors get confused. However,

00:47:06.687 --> 00:47:09.257
unlike incurable polio,
Segawa's disease...

00:47:09.797 --> 00:47:11.027
is completely curable.

00:47:11.927 --> 00:47:16.667
In your expert opinion, what he treated
was not incurable polio, is that correct?

00:47:16.737 --> 00:47:17.897
Yes, that is correct.

00:47:17.997 --> 00:47:22.077
To come out now and say
Sang Woo had Segawa's disease...

00:47:22.677 --> 00:47:25.247
You can't possibly conclude that, can you?

00:47:26.207 --> 00:47:29.047
It's more of a stretch to believe
an incurable disease was cured.

00:47:29.817 --> 00:47:31.077
Either way,

00:47:31.847 --> 00:47:33.717
the defendant, Lee Yu Gyeom...

00:47:34.317 --> 00:47:37.787
- It's a fact that he did treat him.
- Your Honor,

00:47:38.017 --> 00:47:41.597
the defense submitted no prior evidence
regarding Segawa's disease.

00:47:41.697 --> 00:47:42.897
Sustained.

00:47:43.197 --> 00:47:46.697
Attorney Park. Confine your questions
to the defendant's original claim.

00:47:48.067 --> 00:47:49.067
Nothing further.

00:47:51.907 --> 00:47:53.637
The court will recess for 30 minutes.

00:47:54.107 --> 00:47:56.507
And then proceed with the examination
of the second witness.

00:47:59.277 --> 00:48:00.307
Let's go.

00:48:03.077 --> 00:48:04.717
(Defendant)

00:48:04.847 --> 00:48:07.047
- Attorney Park.
- Attorney Park.

00:48:08.387 --> 00:48:09.387
Did you get a hold of him?

00:48:09.787 --> 00:48:11.587
I can't get in touch with Song Tae Jin.

00:48:13.627 --> 00:48:14.997
Right, keep trying.

00:48:15.757 --> 00:48:16.757
Okay.

00:48:17.927 --> 00:48:18.927
Attorney Park,

00:48:19.197 --> 00:48:20.927
please begin your examination
of the second witness.

00:48:21.267 --> 00:48:22.337
Your Honor.

00:48:23.937 --> 00:48:25.607
There's an issue with
the witness's appearance,

00:48:26.307 --> 00:48:28.307
so I request a postponement.

00:48:31.307 --> 00:48:34.447
Isn't witness testimony
the crux of this trial?

00:48:35.447 --> 00:48:40.247
A postponement is unacceptable.
The witness is present in the courtroom.

00:48:43.417 --> 00:48:45.357
Attorney Park,
what is the meaning of this?

00:48:50.827 --> 00:48:51.967
Your Honor.

00:48:52.327 --> 00:48:56.437
If the defense is not going to call
Mr. Song Tae Jin to the stand,

00:48:56.667 --> 00:48:59.067
I request that the prosecution be allowed
to call him as our witness.

00:49:00.267 --> 00:49:03.037
Your Honor, the witness
the prosecution is referring to...

00:49:03.107 --> 00:49:05.007
has been watching
the previous witness's testimony...

00:49:05.077 --> 00:49:07.907
and is likely feeling a great deal
of psychological distress.

00:49:07.977 --> 00:49:12.347
So, I object to the prosecution's request
to call him to the stand.

00:49:14.517 --> 00:49:15.887
Both of you, please be seated.

00:49:21.957 --> 00:49:25.167
The court will confer,
and then issue a ruling.

00:49:35.437 --> 00:49:38.037
The prosecution's request
to call the witness...

00:49:38.847 --> 00:49:39.977
is granted.

00:49:49.957 --> 00:49:50.957
Witness.

00:49:57.557 --> 00:50:01.627
Is it true you also received treatment
from the defendant, Mr. Lee Yu Gyeom?

00:50:04.467 --> 00:50:05.937
Yes, that's correct.

00:50:06.737 --> 00:50:08.167
And were you completely cured?

00:50:12.647 --> 00:50:16.777
No, I wasn't cured.
I'm receiving medical treatment again.

00:50:17.647 --> 00:50:21.287
That man is not a doctor.
He's a complete con man.

00:50:21.547 --> 00:50:25.557
He threatened to leak private information,
my medical records, and family details.

00:50:26.327 --> 00:50:27.357
Don't be fooled by him.

00:50:29.827 --> 00:50:30.927
Nothing further, Your Honor.

00:50:41.777 --> 00:50:43.707
(High Court, District Court)

00:50:45.907 --> 00:50:46.907
Excuse me, Song Tae Jin.

00:50:47.947 --> 00:50:48.947
Wait a second.

00:50:53.017 --> 00:50:54.017
What on earth...

00:50:54.917 --> 00:50:57.487
- Why did you do that?
- Do what?

00:50:58.217 --> 00:51:00.687
I'm asking why you testified
like that in court.

00:51:01.157 --> 00:51:05.527
Because it's the truth.
I'm getting worse again.

00:51:06.297 --> 00:51:07.497
But you clearly said...

00:51:07.767 --> 00:51:11.037
- You were cured.
- I thought I was.

00:51:11.837 --> 00:51:13.237
But it came back.

00:51:16.507 --> 00:51:17.907
Don't you ever...

00:51:18.477 --> 00:51:19.977
come near me again.

00:51:31.417 --> 00:51:32.657
Attorney Park.

00:51:34.127 --> 00:51:35.757
Is this really the best you can do?

00:51:36.627 --> 00:51:38.497
How are we supposed to
win the trial like this?

00:51:38.967 --> 00:51:40.497
You're the one who caused this mess.

00:51:40.927 --> 00:51:42.397
You're blaming me for this?

00:51:42.467 --> 00:51:45.407
Yes. This whole thing happened because
you threatened Song Tae Jin.

00:51:45.467 --> 00:51:47.907
I think you're mistaken.

00:51:48.937 --> 00:51:50.507
If I can't prove my abilities,

00:51:51.607 --> 00:51:52.777
Min Seo will die too.

00:51:55.917 --> 00:51:58.947
You... I told you...

00:51:59.747 --> 00:52:01.517
not to talk so casually about my daughter.

00:52:01.587 --> 00:52:05.227
That's my point.
Just let me prove myself already.

00:52:05.327 --> 00:52:08.727
That's all it would take,
but you were fumbling with the witnesses,

00:52:08.797 --> 00:52:10.327
so I had to step in.

00:52:10.397 --> 00:52:13.267
You stepped in and ruined everything,
you son of a bitch!

00:52:15.397 --> 00:52:17.967
(Fresh Sashimi)

00:52:17.967 --> 00:52:19.037
Mr. Song Tae Jin.

00:52:21.977 --> 00:52:23.577
I'm sorry for showing up unannounced.

00:52:24.307 --> 00:52:27.177
If you don't mind,
I'd just like to ask you a few things.

00:52:30.017 --> 00:52:33.747
They told me I was completely cured,
but since he's not a real doctor,

00:52:34.417 --> 00:52:36.187
so I got worried and went back
to the hospital.

00:52:37.617 --> 00:52:40.427
Sure enough, I had a relapse.

00:52:41.357 --> 00:52:46.067
So in other words,
Lee Woo Gyeom's treatment didn't work?

00:52:46.567 --> 00:52:47.597
That's right.

00:52:49.167 --> 00:52:51.697
In time, Sang Woo...

00:52:52.537 --> 00:52:54.007
will end up just like me.

00:52:54.837 --> 00:52:58.207
But after his treatment
from Lee Woo Gyeom,

00:52:58.277 --> 00:52:59.907
Sang Woo never received
any hospital treatments.

00:53:02.477 --> 00:53:06.217
To be clear, you went to the hospital
after Lee Woo Gyeom's supposed cure?

00:53:06.347 --> 00:53:07.347
Yes.

00:53:08.887 --> 00:53:09.887
So then...

00:53:10.887 --> 00:53:14.057
Prosecutor, you can't let the patient
get another procedure.

00:53:14.487 --> 00:53:16.757
If it interferes with my methods,

00:53:17.657 --> 00:53:19.167
he'll never be able to recover.

00:53:24.567 --> 00:53:28.637
So your condition got worse
when you resumed hospital treatment.

00:53:29.377 --> 00:53:30.377
What?

00:53:31.777 --> 00:53:33.347
Not because of Lee Woo Gyeom.

00:53:35.417 --> 00:53:37.917
Your records and witnesses
have been refuted,

00:53:39.217 --> 00:53:42.617
- so how can I possibly trust you anymore?
- What I want right now...

00:53:43.387 --> 00:53:46.727
is to prove my abilities
so I can treat people who are suffering.

00:53:46.987 --> 00:53:49.897
My intentions are good.
Why can't you convey that properly?

00:53:52.967 --> 00:53:53.967
Because...

00:53:55.027 --> 00:53:56.397
that's not what you really want.

00:53:56.937 --> 00:53:58.907
Would someone
with such good intentions...

00:53:59.707 --> 00:54:01.367
treat the witnesses like garbage?

00:54:03.907 --> 00:54:05.477
You, be honest with me.

00:54:06.847 --> 00:54:09.277
Why do you really want to prove yourself?

00:54:11.117 --> 00:54:12.247
You want me to tell you?

00:54:14.647 --> 00:54:16.117
Are you sure you can handle it?
