WEBVTT

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:37.439
Sending you to fight Commander Liao

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.359
This is the trap they set for you

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.239
Like I don't know that

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.400
Living under someone else's roof is hard

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.280
Brother

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:46.799
Why don't we just leave?

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:48.239
And become deserters?

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.280
We ate their food

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:52.920
So we have to perform for them

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:54.799
That is the rule

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.719
Otherwise, wherever we go in the future

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.680
We won't get by

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:00.400
Being a soldier

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.239
Surely you're not afraid of fighting

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:04.840
Who says I'm afraid of fighting?

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.519
The problem is this battle

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:07.920
Is like a dung beetle bearing gifts

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.120
It's nothing but death

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.959
True

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.639
If this battle must be fought

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.479
I actually have a plan

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.759
It's all your fault

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:23.000
Sweet-talking the brothers into this fire pit

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:24.800
The wise ruler you spoke of

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.439
Is this how he treats his brothers?

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:27.439
Alright, alright, alright

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.319
Don't blame him either

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.719
He didn't know

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.599
It would turn out like this

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:36.919
Tell us about your plan

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:41.560
We can imitate Zhuge Liang's alliance with Wu against Cao

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:43.599
Ally with Division Commander Chen to fight Liao's forces

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.039
Maybe we stand a chance

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.520
What does that mean?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.120
Zhuge Liang

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.400
Who is that?

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:51.479
You don't know?

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.240
The guy selling rice cakes at your gate

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:57.479
No way

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.759
When the adjutant betrayed me

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.439
He kicked me while I was down and tried to catch me

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.199
I haven't even settled that score with him

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:05.240
And now ally with him?

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:06.280
Don't even think about it

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.919
Commander, don't be so stubborn

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.479
Letting the higher-ups see your action

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:11.360
Is what matters most

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:13.000
We can't go fight a battle

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.479
That we know we can't win

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.680
Commander Fan can help you recruit troops

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.599
He is very useful

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.879
You can't let him die for nothing

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:23.360
Temporarily allying with Division Commander Chen

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.960
Is just to increase the odds of winning

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.039
And reduce the losses

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:28.000
As the saying goes, there are no permanent friends

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.560
And no permanent enemies

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:33.919
If I agree to this

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.919
Will that old cousin Chen actually do it?

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:37.439
Profit comes first in everything

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:39.000
As long as Division Commander Chen thinks

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.039
This battle is profitable

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:41.199
He will likely do it

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.520
How about

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.520
Letting Commander Fan go meet Division Commander Chen

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.319
What if it works?

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.879
If it doesn't work

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.199
Then let him attack Liao's forces alone

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.240
Coming

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.280
Coming, coming, coming

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.680
Stop right there

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:12.479
Stop

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.680
Get the hell out

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:18.800
I'll only say this once

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.080
I'm not after money or sex

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.199
But I am a ruthless man

00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:25.560
I'm the top fighter under Commander Liao

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:27.639
As long as you cooperate

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.360
I guarantee your safety

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.360
Up, get up

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:31.079
Move

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.079
Commander Liao invites Commander Chen's Fifth Concubine to tea

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.040
Move! Let go!

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.639
Commander Liao invites Commander Chen's Fifth Concubine to tea

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:40.439
Commander Liao invites Commander Chen's Fifth Concubine to tea

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:41.199
Get the hell out

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:43.120
Let me go

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:45.199
Commander Liao invites Commander Chen's Fifth Concubine to tea

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:45.839
They're coming, they're coming

00:04:46.079 --> 00:04:47.120
I saw them coming too

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.600
Let go

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.199
Don't scream

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:51.519
Help!

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:53.720
Someone help!

00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:56.639
Help!

00:04:58.519 --> 00:05:00.160
What do you think you're doing?

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.560
In broad daylight, right in the open

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:05.720
You bunch of bandits

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:09.360
Daring to abduct a decent woman

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.959
Where did this idiot come from?

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:12.519
Don't meddle in this

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:14.680
I'm one of Commander Liao's men

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:16.240
I don't care which commander

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:17.319
Commander Liao

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:21.639
I'm not afraid of Commander Liao

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.600
Let her go immediately

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.399
No

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:25.480
Let her go

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.319
No

00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:27.120
Let her go

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.480
No! What are you gonna do?

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.720
Come at me if you have the guts

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:30.759
No

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.920
Don't blame me for showing no mercy

00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:34.560
Hit him

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.560
Come on, get him

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:43.720
Had enough?

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.399
Enough

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.839
You know how tough I am now?

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:50.160
Why did you hit me?

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.079
We're here to save you

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:55.120
They are the bandits

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.519
You... you dare touch me?

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:02.560
You have a death wish

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:15.240
I'm going back to tell my Chen-Chen

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:16.959
Madam

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:19.639
We'll escort you home

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:20.480
Let's go

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:21.000
Move

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:24.079
This way

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:33.199
Commander Liao

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.000
You heard right

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:37.040
Everyone on the street heard it

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:42.360
Does that Liao Guanguan have nothing better to do?

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:44.319
Commander, let's go chase them first

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.480
Let's go

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.319
Right turn

00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:53.240
Old Chen

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:55.360
Fifth Concubine, are you alright?

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.720
Old Chen

00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:57.680
Old Chen

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.639
Someone bullied me

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:00.720
Old Chen

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:02.040
Old Chen

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:04.120
Chen-Chen

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.279
There, there. Don't cry

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:06.319
It's good that you're back

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:07.279
It's good that you're back

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.240
Following you

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.920
Even if I don't get to enjoy a good life

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.199
I still have to live this kind of

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.879
Life filled with fear

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:14.000
There, there

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:14.759
There, there

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:16.759
Division Commander Chen

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:18.600
Your wife

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.879
Commander Liao kidnapped her just like that

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.399
That is simply unacceptable

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.000
And this is?

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:25.839
They were the ones who saved me

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:26.720
Your humble servant

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.759
A subordinate of Commander Wei

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:30.399
Fan Pengju

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.360
This is our Commander Fan

00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:35.399
You are Fan Pengju?

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:37.120
I was thinking you looked familiar

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.560
Your portrait was everywhere a while ago

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.439
I didn't expect we'd meet in this way

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:43.560
Old Chen

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.959
You have to avenge me

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.000
Okay, okay, okay

00:07:48.279 --> 00:07:49.519
In broad daylight

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.759
Making it known to everyone

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.680
What exactly does this Liao Guanguan want?

00:07:53.079 --> 00:07:55.040
Isn't it because he covets my beauty?

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:56.279
Since I've been with you

00:07:56.519 --> 00:07:57.800
Although I work hard every day

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.360
But in the whole town

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:01.399
I'm still one of the best

00:08:02.279 --> 00:08:03.240
The Madam is right

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.000
I didn't expect

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.399
Commander Liao has a fetish for other men's wives

00:08:07.879 --> 00:08:09.120
As a man myself

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.639
I fully understand

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:12.759
Division Commander Chen's feelings right now

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.519
Adjutant

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.079
Here

00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:17.160
Take the Madam to rest

00:08:17.439 --> 00:08:17.839
Yes, sir

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.639
You have to vent this anger for me

00:08:19.639 --> 00:08:20.439
Okay, okay, okay

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.439
About this matter

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:27.680
How does Commander Fan think I should handle it?

00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:32.800
Commander Wei

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.600
Just happened to send me to attack Commander Liao's troops

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.360
Otherwise

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.399
Let's join forces

00:08:39.759 --> 00:08:41.480
And teach that Liao a lesson

00:08:45.759 --> 00:08:47.440
So the famous Commander Fan

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.039
Also operates this way

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:50.879
Have a seat

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.679
Truly unique

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.159
Wei Mangzi and I both know clearly

00:09:01.639 --> 00:09:03.759
Neither of us can beat Liao Guanguan alone

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.159
Only by cooperating

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.080
Can we stand against him

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.279
However

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.720
Commander Wei and I have some personal grievances

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.879
And he is quite petty

00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:14.679
Our Commander Wei says

00:09:15.399 --> 00:09:17.600
Even married couples have conflicts

00:09:18.639 --> 00:09:20.960
They fight at the head of the bed and make up at the end

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.080
Then when I fought you during the bandit suppression

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.679
You don't hate me either?

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.519
Bandits ought to be suppressed

00:09:29.159 --> 00:09:29.679
Otherwise

00:09:30.639 --> 00:09:32.200
I wouldn't be carrying this gun

00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:34.200
Sit, sit, sit

00:09:36.679 --> 00:09:38.519
You, Commander Fan, are quite interesting

00:09:39.039 --> 00:09:40.799
I've heard of your heroic deeds too

00:09:41.679 --> 00:09:42.399
How about this

00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:45.039
I'll give you, Commander Fan, some face

00:09:45.639 --> 00:09:46.600
And ally with you

00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:48.799
After this battle is over

00:09:48.799 --> 00:09:51.039
You consider coming over to my side

00:09:52.159 --> 00:09:54.000
So you don't have to... just to cooperate with me

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.639
...go as far as kidnapping my Fifth Concubine

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.240
You figured that out, huh?

00:10:10.279 --> 00:10:11.159
Wait a moment

00:10:11.679 --> 00:10:13.080
Let them sign

00:10:22.519 --> 00:10:24.519
That scoundrel Huo

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.240
Let me

00:10:30.279 --> 00:10:30.879
Commander Wei

00:10:31.639 --> 00:10:32.600
This is Staff Officer Huo

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.559
Good, young and promising

00:10:36.519 --> 00:10:37.360
No, no

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.000
He is Division Commander Chen's staff officer now

00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:44.039
Let me

00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:47.000
We'll figure something else out

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.120
Today is a family dinner

00:10:55.519 --> 00:10:56.600
Don't stand on ceremony, everyone

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.159
Come, sit down, sit down, sit down

00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:00.360
Commander Fan

00:11:00.639 --> 00:11:02.120
Is the hero of this operation

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:03.519
Come over here quickly

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:04.840
Sit, sit, sit

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.600
Why are you standing there like a post

00:11:12.799 --> 00:11:13.879
Acting like a telephone pole

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.399
The Commander is here

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.720
Come sit down, quick

00:11:21.679 --> 00:11:22.919
Can't I control you at all

00:11:23.159 --> 00:11:24.120
Won't listen to me

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.320
Come, sit

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.320
Sit down

00:11:28.399 --> 00:11:30.720
I really can't control you anymore

00:11:34.399 --> 00:11:36.200
We are all one family now

00:11:36.559 --> 00:11:37.759
With the same goal

00:11:37.919 --> 00:11:39.600
When the allied forces win later

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.120
Our spoils of war

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:42.720
Will be split fifty-fifty

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.399
Commander Wei is a stand-up guy

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:50.840
I believe

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.559
That the alliance between our two armies

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.639
Will surely be solid as a rock

00:12:00.039 --> 00:12:01.559
To the success of our alliance

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:02.559
Cheers

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:03.840
Cheers

00:12:04.559 --> 00:12:05.200
Cheers

00:12:11.559 --> 00:12:12.559
What's wrong with you

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.559
You've been pulling a long face since you got here today

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:17.679
Believe it or not

00:12:19.399 --> 00:12:20.639
I'll hit you in a moment

00:12:21.799 --> 00:12:22.960
Do you believe me

00:12:25.919 --> 00:12:27.840
I was splashing her, how did it get on you

00:12:28.279 --> 00:12:28.919
Sorry, sorry, sorry

00:12:28.919 --> 00:12:29.559
It's fine, it's fine

00:12:29.559 --> 00:12:30.519
Let me wipe it for you

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.399
My head hurts, sit down

00:12:41.919 --> 00:12:42.639
Sit down

00:12:43.799 --> 00:12:45.279
It's fine, really, it's fine

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:46.919
It's fine, it's fine, Commander Fan

00:12:47.759 --> 00:12:49.840
I am currently under the care of Division Commander Chen

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.320
Serving as a humble Chief of Staff under him

00:12:53.519 --> 00:12:55.000
Although there is conflict between us

00:12:55.519 --> 00:12:57.399
Like you killing my butler

00:12:57.399 --> 00:12:58.960
Or burning down my ancestral home, it doesn't matter

00:12:59.159 --> 00:13:00.039
We

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.679
Will always be allies

00:13:02.559 --> 00:13:03.159
Exactly

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.200
Do we have a conflict

00:13:05.639 --> 00:13:06.759
I don't think we have any conflict, do we

00:13:06.879 --> 00:13:07.559
That's right

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.240
No conflict, no conflict

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.440
There is absolutely no conflict

00:13:10.559 --> 00:13:12.200
Young Master Huo is broad-minded

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.159
I can't eat with the man who killed my father

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:23.840
I'm sorry

00:13:24.039 --> 00:13:24.960
My wife here

00:13:25.519 --> 00:13:26.759
Just has a bit of a temper

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.600
Sometimes she even hits me

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.480
I'll go teach her a lesson now

00:13:30.879 --> 00:13:32.000
You guys eat first

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:32.639
You guys eat first

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:33.639
Stop

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.000
Come, it's a small matter, doesn't affect anything

00:13:38.519 --> 00:13:39.200
Come, let's keep drinking

00:13:48.159 --> 00:13:49.519
You said you'd avenge my father

00:13:49.759 --> 00:13:51.000
The big battle is imminent

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.200
We can't touch him

00:13:53.279 --> 00:13:54.360
Just endure it for a bit

00:13:55.039 --> 00:13:56.960
This vengeance will definitely be taken

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.440
So you want to be partners with him

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.879
I just found out too

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.399
That he joined Division Commander Chen

00:14:02.399 --> 00:14:03.799
I don't understand you people

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.240
One moment you're fighting this one

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.159
The next you're making peace with that one

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.879
I only know he is my father's murderer

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:08.799
If you are going to

00:14:08.799 --> 00:14:09.840
Eat at the same table with him again

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:10.840
And you can still swallow it

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.399
Then excuse me for not joining you

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.120
Reporting.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.519
My shrew of a wife...

00:14:32.519 --> 00:14:33.799
...is too fierce.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.440
I apologize to the two commanders.

00:14:37.879 --> 00:14:38.519
I kneel.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.600
The Chen-Wei alliance must be solid as a rock.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:48.600
Well said.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.600
Then let's wish that our first battle...

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.480
...is a victory from the start.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.600
Cheers.

00:15:04.799 --> 00:15:06.639
Since my Sworn Brother joined our army...

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.799
...many able-bodied men came admiring your name.

00:15:08.919 --> 00:15:10.240
It allowed me to recover some strength.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.440
I really thank you.

00:15:11.519 --> 00:15:12.360
You're too kind.

00:15:12.879 --> 00:15:13.840
We are all family.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.279
Although they came for my name...

00:15:16.919 --> 00:15:18.480
...they are still your soldiers.

00:15:21.039 --> 00:15:22.200
Acting as the vanguard this time...

00:15:22.639 --> 00:15:23.720
...you take them with you.

00:15:24.039 --> 00:15:24.960
They all look up to you.

00:15:25.879 --> 00:15:26.720
They are loyal to you.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.000
These men haven't fought a proper battle.

00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:31.759
Should we send some experienced ones?

00:15:32.759 --> 00:15:33.600
What do you mean?

00:15:35.159 --> 00:15:36.320
Do you look down on Commander Fan?

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:39.639
Sworn Brother.

00:15:40.279 --> 00:15:40.960
This time...

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:42.440
...just let loose...

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:43.799
...and go all out.

00:15:44.399 --> 00:15:46.200
I'll handle the logistics support for you.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.679
Rations, weapons, take whatever you want.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.360
Commander Wei.

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.519
Those dry rations of yours are damp.

00:15:55.559 --> 00:15:57.120
It's normal in this weather.

00:15:57.679 --> 00:15:58.799
And you call yourselves a regular army?

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.240
We all know...

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.360
...rations are the top priority on the battlefield.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000
If the brothers aren't full...

00:16:04.159 --> 00:16:04.960
...how can they kill the enemy?

00:16:05.919 --> 00:16:06.559
You, Commander Wei...

00:16:06.559 --> 00:16:08.320
...surely understand this principle, right?

00:16:08.799 --> 00:16:09.559
What do you mean?

00:16:09.559 --> 00:16:10.679
What do you mean "what do I mean"?

00:16:10.799 --> 00:16:11.480
Are you being stingy?

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.440
Give us something good to eat.

00:16:12.559 --> 00:16:13.679
You are going to fight a war.

00:16:13.759 --> 00:16:14.960
You're not going to a banquet.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.279
Don't you know your own weight?

00:16:17.559 --> 00:16:19.000
My weight? You come here.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:20.799
Come on, come on.

00:16:22.559 --> 00:16:23.399
About this matter...

00:16:23.919 --> 00:16:25.480
...maybe I was negligent.

00:16:28.799 --> 00:16:30.000
If it's damp, it's damp.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.159
Is it moldy?

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.759
If it's not moldy, it can be eaten.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.320
Why be so delicate?

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.519
Some gun barrels are crooked.

00:16:39.399 --> 00:16:40.159
Some guns...

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:41.519
...jam.

00:16:42.159 --> 00:16:42.720
Commander.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.039
These are probably the rejects.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.080
Do you think being a regular army is easy?

00:16:47.559 --> 00:16:49.080
We aren't like some bandits...

00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:50.320
...robbing and looting.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.399
Money comes so easily.

00:16:51.639 --> 00:16:52.200
What do you mean?

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:52.759
What are you saying?

00:16:52.759 --> 00:16:53.919
I don't act lawlessly.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:54.639
Who is a bandit?

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:55.440
What's wrong with bandits?

00:16:55.519 --> 00:16:56.759
Bandits follow rules better than you do.

00:16:56.919 --> 00:16:57.639
And talk about honor.

00:16:59.759 --> 00:17:00.679
Can you pull the trigger or not?

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.519
If it fires, that's enough.

00:17:06.759 --> 00:17:07.320
Sworn Brother.

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:09.879
Among the three forces...

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.319
...our army is the weakest.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.599
This alliance with Division Commander Chen...

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:15.759
...if we win...

00:17:16.759 --> 00:17:18.319
...our days ahead will be easier.

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:19.599
So...

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.319
...please bear with it a bit.

00:17:22.279 --> 00:17:22.799
As for me...

00:17:23.519 --> 00:17:24.599
...I'll be in the rear...

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:25.559
...waiting for your triumphant return.

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:27.559
I'll have the celebration wine ready for you.

00:17:29.079 --> 00:17:30.640
No matter how round you draw the pie...

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.039
...it's better to have something practical.

00:17:32.039 --> 00:17:32.440
Right.

00:17:32.519 --> 00:17:33.400
Exactly.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:35.599
Otherwise...

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:36.759
...we won't be alive to eat it.

00:17:38.079 --> 00:17:39.359
Three armies in a standoff.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.160
Others looking on will also think...

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.519
...we look a bit shabby.

00:17:49.039 --> 00:17:49.519
All right

00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:52.240
Then I'll take out the best stuff

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:53.559
I've been saving for you

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.240
Commander

00:17:54.359 --> 00:17:55.839
That is our last trump card

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.119
You make it sound so intense

00:17:57.559 --> 00:17:58.400
What is it?

00:18:01.599 --> 00:18:02.519
A tank

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:05.759
A tank

00:18:06.759 --> 00:18:07.960
Can we go take a look?

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.000
It's already yours

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.079
Look all you want

00:18:11.799 --> 00:18:12.359
Jizi

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:13.640
Take Commander Fan there

00:18:14.319 --> 00:18:14.640
Let's go

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.519
Go, go

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.119
This way, please

00:18:19.559 --> 00:18:21.359
Are we really just sending those ragtag troops?

00:18:22.119 --> 00:18:23.799
They only listen to him, not me

00:18:24.039 --> 00:18:25.319
If I don't use them as cannon fodder

00:18:25.319 --> 00:18:26.200
what good are they?

00:18:26.519 --> 00:18:27.960
If they lose

00:18:28.079 --> 00:18:29.079
I won't be heartbroken

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.480
And if they win?

00:18:32.559 --> 00:18:33.519
Relying on them

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.000
to beat the well-equipped Liao Guanguan?

00:18:36.359 --> 00:18:37.279
Is that even possible?

00:18:39.599 --> 00:18:42.039
But Commander Chen doesn't want to lose this battle

00:18:42.359 --> 00:18:44.160
He'll definitely send his strongest troops

00:18:44.799 --> 00:18:46.359
We'll just tag along and reap the benefits

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.039
This battle

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.960
is the perfect chance to take that fool down a peg

00:18:55.319 --> 00:18:55.960
Otherwise

00:18:56.559 --> 00:18:58.480
he'll really think he's a hero

00:18:59.839 --> 00:19:00.799
Staff Officer Huo

00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:03.559
The latrines in the camp are all cleaned

00:19:05.759 --> 00:19:08.240
Given my friendship with Commander Qin

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.000
Commander Qin really ought to be scrubbing with me

00:19:11.839 --> 00:19:13.720
I don't want to get covered in filth

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.599
I warned you long ago

00:19:15.839 --> 00:19:18.640
The higher you climb, the harder you fall

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.079
I don't mind if Commander Qin laughs

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.119
Even if I, Huo, am scrubbing latrines

00:19:25.519 --> 00:19:28.200
I'll scrub my way to being Commander Chen's favorite

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.000
Commander Chen is taking me to the alliance banquet

00:19:32.279 --> 00:19:33.559
because he knows

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.160
that only I can keep Fan Sha'er in check

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.799
Shameless boasting

00:19:41.359 --> 00:19:43.279
That's just so I can match up

00:19:43.279 --> 00:19:44.440
to you, Commander Qin

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:45.839
Commander Qin

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.119
you are Commander Chen's elite general

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.400
If you and I were to join forces

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.279
we'd have both brains and brawn

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.480
When that happens

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.119
even Commander Chen

00:19:56.559 --> 00:19:58.079
could be manipulated a little

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.359
The world has certainly changed.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.359
A profiteer like you dares to show off in front of me.

00:20:08.799 --> 00:20:09.839
In the past,

00:20:10.759 --> 00:20:11.559
I would have shot you

00:20:11.559 --> 00:20:12.680
without even blinking an eye.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.599
Do you believe me?

00:20:14.119 --> 00:20:15.720
You should never underestimate

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.359
a soldier's loyalty.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:18.720
Loyalty?

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.920
Using the military's power

00:20:22.279 --> 00:20:24.400
to go to the gentry and merchants

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.359
and forcibly collect protection taxes?

00:20:26.799 --> 00:20:28.200
Using military personnel

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.319
to deliver takeout for hotpot restaurants?

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.759
Your residence, Commander Qin,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.720
is even more luxurious than Division Commander Chen's.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.640
Tell me, as a loyal soldier,

00:20:36.759 --> 00:20:38.400
shouldn't you hand it over?

00:20:39.319 --> 00:20:40.799
Are you threatening me?

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.319
I wouldn't dare.

00:20:43.839 --> 00:20:45.599
I've only heard rumors.

00:20:45.839 --> 00:20:47.079
And there's no evidence anyway.

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:48.200
I wasn't involved.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.480
But that Fan Sha'er...

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.559
he has always been Commander Qin's partner.

00:20:55.039 --> 00:20:57.079
Fan joined Commander Wei's forces long ago.

00:20:57.559 --> 00:20:59.359
Now with the two armies allied,

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.559
would he really run to Division Commander Chen

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.680
and rat me out?

00:21:02.799 --> 00:21:03.880
That's hard to say.

00:21:04.359 --> 00:21:05.599
You know as well as I do.

00:21:05.759 --> 00:21:08.799
Division Commander Chen has always wanted to recruit that Fan.

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.720
This alliance to attack Commander Liao's forces...

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.640
the person Commander Wei sent is Commander Fan.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:16.920
So I think

00:21:17.119 --> 00:21:20.319
Division Commander Chen might want to recruit him again.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.279
If he comes over,

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.559
he's already a commander himself.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.359
He'd be on equal footing with you.

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:27.599
After he arrives,

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:31.240
do you think Division Commander Chen will promote him?

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.279
Once he's promoted,

00:21:33.359 --> 00:21:35.119
he'll be walking all over you.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.480
Your life probably won't be easy.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.799
Then if he takes those matters in town,

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.279
and spices up the story,

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:45.640
Commander Qin,

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.799
you probably won't even be able to keep your underwear.

00:21:52.319 --> 00:21:54.559
I assume the Staff Officer has already thought of

00:21:54.559 --> 00:21:55.640
a countermeasure for me.

00:22:03.039 --> 00:22:04.319
Fan Sha'er

00:22:04.519 --> 00:22:06.279
cannot be spared.

00:22:06.839 --> 00:22:08.160
So we must seize this opportunity.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.440
Commander Qin,

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.640
you must ask Division Commander Chen for battle orders.

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:16.720
On the battlefield, bullets have no eyes.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.119
We can then take the chance...

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.920
Killing our own before the allies even march?

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.039
I can't take the blame for that.

00:22:27.039 --> 00:22:28.200
Commander Qin,

00:22:28.599 --> 00:22:30.920
we have always been on the same side.

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:31.880
I guarantee,

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.079
I won't let you take the fall.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.039
Furthermore,

00:22:35.559 --> 00:22:37.680
I will ensure you get the top credit.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.799
A tank!

00:22:41.359 --> 00:22:42.079
It's really a tank!

00:22:42.799 --> 00:22:43.680
This is awesome!

00:22:43.839 --> 00:22:45.079
Let me go up and try it, Brother.

00:22:45.079 --> 00:22:46.559
Alright, alright. Slow down, slow down.

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.079
Why is this barrel so thick?

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.839
Tank!

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.039
It really is a tank!

00:22:53.119 --> 00:22:55.200
This tank is indeed a tank.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.920
Except it doesn't move.

00:22:59.799 --> 00:23:00.720
Then what's the use of it?

00:23:02.279 --> 00:23:03.440
It is indeed useless.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.519
Screw it.

00:23:05.839 --> 00:23:06.480
Then Commander Wei...

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.880
does he actually want us to win the battle?

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.599
He wants to use this battle

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.400
to see if we can truly be of use to him.

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:17.759
That bastard Wei is doing this on purpose.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.519
Isn't he afraid we'll rebel?

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.000
Let's just rebel and be done with it.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:21.799
You're right.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.720
Let's rebel. We won't work for him anymore.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.000
We have already formed an alliance.

00:23:25.519 --> 00:23:27.000
Stabbing someone in the back...

00:23:27.599 --> 00:23:28.440
isn't righteous.

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:33.720
The tank is moving!

00:23:34.079 --> 00:23:34.839
The tank is moving!

00:23:34.839 --> 00:23:35.920
What is that?

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:37.119
Is it a rat?

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.720
Catch it! Catch it! Catch it!

00:23:41.319 --> 00:23:42.279
Let's see how big this rat is.

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:43.960
Who are you?

00:23:44.319 --> 00:23:45.279
Why did you hit me?

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:49.480
Brother!

00:23:49.839 --> 00:23:50.559
Brother!

00:23:50.839 --> 00:23:51.839
How come it's you?

00:23:56.319 --> 00:23:57.839
There's more food. Eat slowly.

00:23:59.119 --> 00:24:00.319
The kid is starving.

00:24:00.799 --> 00:24:01.759
Go pour him some water.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:04.480
Slow down, slow down.

00:24:08.039 --> 00:24:09.000
Now,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.319
I formally introduce to everyone,

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.680
my sworn little brother.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.799
What's your name?

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.200
I forgot to ask when we swore brotherhood last time.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.240
I have already abandoned my name.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.480
A child of the Jianghu wanders the world.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:29.039
Please give me a new name, Big Brother.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:32.079
You're the little beggars'

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.720
ringleader.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.079
How about we call you Little Boss?

00:24:37.759 --> 00:24:38.279
That works.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.799
That name's got a kick to it.

00:24:41.039 --> 00:24:43.079
You really do love swearing brotherhood everywhere.

00:24:43.319 --> 00:24:44.000
So what?

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:45.799
Everyone sitting here

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.839
is a sworn brother of mine.

00:24:48.079 --> 00:24:48.759
Except for you.

00:24:50.519 --> 00:24:51.680
We went back looking for you, too.

00:24:51.759 --> 00:24:52.599
But we couldn't find you.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.000
How did you end up here?

00:24:55.079 --> 00:24:56.039
My old man's people

00:24:56.279 --> 00:24:57.599
found me in that place.

00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.680
So naturally, I couldn't stay there anymore.

00:25:00.119 --> 00:25:00.680
Enough about that.

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.279
You just joined up and you're already a commander.

00:25:05.359 --> 00:25:06.519
Not bad.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.000
What were you doing over by the tank?

00:25:11.599 --> 00:25:13.319
I stayed there for ages without getting caught.

00:25:13.599 --> 00:25:15.079
We're planning to take the tank into battle.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:16.400
Who are you fighting?

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:17.680
Commander Liao.

00:25:18.519 --> 00:25:19.400
Commander Liao?

00:25:19.839 --> 00:25:21.359
You want to fight Commander Liao?

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.119
What are you laughing at?

00:25:23.559 --> 00:25:24.559
You look down on us?

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.599
I certainly do look down on you.

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.079
Just the few of you?

00:25:29.039 --> 00:25:30.680
That's Commander Liao.

00:25:31.519 --> 00:25:32.240
See that?

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:34.119
Even a kid can read the situation.

00:25:35.359 --> 00:25:36.279
Commander Liao...

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.359
is he really that tough?

00:25:38.519 --> 00:25:39.640
He's more than just tough.

00:25:40.319 --> 00:25:42.160
With those few junk tanks of yours,

00:25:43.279 --> 00:25:46.200
you couldn't even scratch the tip of Commander Liao's toe.

00:25:46.359 --> 00:25:48.000
Then why the hell are we fighting?

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.720
Forget it. We're not fighting.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.400
That won't do.

00:25:51.799 --> 00:25:53.839
This is our first battle for Commander Wei.

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.319
We can't just back down before we start.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.119
How would we ever show our faces again?

00:25:58.319 --> 00:25:59.720
Fighting when you know you'll lose?

00:26:00.279 --> 00:26:02.599
Why throw your brothers' lives away?

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:08.400
If you must fight, it's not impossible.

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.000
Take me

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:13.920
along with you.

00:26:15.359 --> 00:26:16.680
We're fighting a war,

00:26:16.799 --> 00:26:18.079
not playing house.

00:26:18.559 --> 00:26:20.039
War is about tactics.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.200
Outsmarting the enemy takes strategy.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.599
The Art of War speaks of...

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.119
Pre-battle preparations,

00:26:26.519 --> 00:26:27.960
the application of strategy,

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.799
Look at them, they're totally lost.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.720
and the analysis of enemy intelligence.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:32.960
About these things,

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:35.519
you probably don't know as much as I do.

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:40.720
You're quite something, Little Boss.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.880
To fight, you must strike their weakness.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.000
To attack, you must hit their vitals.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.079
Do you happen to know

00:26:48.079 --> 00:26:49.880
where Commander Liao's armory is?

00:26:52.759 --> 00:26:54.079
Or where his granary is?

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.920
How do you know that?

00:26:59.039 --> 00:27:01.200
With the sky for a blanket and the earth for a bed,

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.920
I crawl around everywhere, all day long.

00:27:03.759 --> 00:27:05.599
I even found your junk tanks, didn't I?

00:27:06.359 --> 00:27:07.759
Is there anything I can't find?

00:27:08.279 --> 00:27:09.400
Boss, have some water.

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:10.319
Here, have some chicken. Eat up.

00:27:10.319 --> 00:27:11.799
Let me pour you another bowl of water.

00:27:18.079 --> 00:27:20.440
You really do know everything.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:21.759
Take me with you.

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.480
Even if we can't topple Commander Liao,

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.039
we can at least make him hurt.

00:27:26.599 --> 00:27:27.279
Good.

00:27:28.759 --> 00:27:30.799
This is a battle we have to fight.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.720
The conditions are harsh and difficulties abound.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:35.640
However,

00:27:36.519 --> 00:27:37.920
we have allies.

00:27:38.839 --> 00:27:41.279
If worst comes to worst, the allies go first.

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.519
We'll just hide behind their butts.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:45.039
Exactly.

00:27:45.519 --> 00:27:46.839
If we win this battle,

00:27:47.039 --> 00:27:48.359
I'll go ask the Commander for a reward.

00:27:48.799 --> 00:27:50.519
Even if we lose, it's no big deal.

00:27:50.839 --> 00:27:52.799
I'll just go and explain it nicely to the Commander.

00:27:53.039 --> 00:27:53.920
None of this is important.

00:27:54.319 --> 00:27:55.200
What's most important is,

00:27:55.799 --> 00:27:56.720
on the battlefield,

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.720
everyone must focus on staying alive.

00:27:59.559 --> 00:28:01.119
Coming back safely

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.880
is the greatest victory.

00:28:03.559 --> 00:28:06.279
This time we're allying with Wei's forces to attack Liao's forces.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.279
How do you all think

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:09.960
this battle should be fought?

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.480
Since there are allies,

00:28:11.839 --> 00:28:13.160
let the allies charge in front.

00:28:13.519 --> 00:28:15.240
Let's not make senseless sacrifices.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.240
Preserve our strength,

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.759
and pick up the spoils later.

00:28:18.039 --> 00:28:18.960
If you think like that,

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.400
the other side thinks like that too.

00:28:20.599 --> 00:28:21.440
Then this battle,

00:28:21.839 --> 00:28:22.640
what's the point of fighting it?

00:28:23.039 --> 00:28:25.240
I think, since we are an alliance,

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.759
we should follow the rules of the pact.

00:28:28.279 --> 00:28:29.400
We show our strength,

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:30.759
and together with our allies,

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.279
if we fight, we fight to our heart's content.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.680
War,

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:43.039
originally has no black and white, right or wrong.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.279
To put it plainly, it's all a struggle for benefits.

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:46.960
Since we are fighting,

00:28:47.319 --> 00:28:49.720
we must find a way to maximize our benefits.

00:28:52.119 --> 00:28:53.839
Allies are allies,

00:28:54.519 --> 00:28:55.960
but we can't hang our heads

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:57.559
on someone else's body.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.960
We must fight side by side with the allies,

00:29:00.279 --> 00:29:02.079
and create opportunities for them,

00:29:02.839 --> 00:29:03.880
build ladders for them,

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.440
help them ram the city gates,

00:29:05.799 --> 00:29:07.839
and let them achieve victory.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.559
Then where does the benefit come from?

00:29:11.759 --> 00:29:12.400
Well,

00:29:13.559 --> 00:29:16.240
allies becoming enemies

00:29:17.119 --> 00:29:19.000
happens in a split second.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.359
Just after fighting Commander Liao,

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:23.960
we and the allies

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.720
will inevitably suffer casualties.

00:29:27.599 --> 00:29:29.039
To go to war with the allies again,

00:29:29.519 --> 00:29:31.480
do you think we can afford that?

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.079
The allies sent a bandit squad.

00:29:34.319 --> 00:29:35.039
Gentlemen,

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.200
we are wearing military uniforms.

00:29:37.759 --> 00:29:39.839
You make it sound so easy.

00:29:40.079 --> 00:29:41.319
If we do it your way,

00:29:41.599 --> 00:29:43.279
who would dare ally with us in the future?

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.839
Winners are kings, losers are bandits.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:49.599
History is written by the survivors.

00:29:50.799 --> 00:29:51.839
Gentlemen, please look.

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:53.400
Secret order from Wei's headquarters.

00:29:57.359 --> 00:29:57.920
Urgent order:

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.319
After Commander Fan and Chen's army finish attacking Liao's troops,

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:05.160
immediately execute the Chen army generals on the spot.

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.319
This is a secret order.

00:30:08.559 --> 00:30:09.119
Commander.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.039
So,

00:30:16.799 --> 00:30:19.039
they were the ones who broke faith first.

00:30:20.359 --> 00:30:21.839
At most, ours counts as...

00:30:22.039 --> 00:30:22.839
Counts as, counts as...

00:30:23.079 --> 00:30:25.039
counts as justifiable defense.

00:30:26.599 --> 00:30:27.119
Wicked.

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:29.640
Too wicked.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.480
However,

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:34.720
I like it.

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:36.799
Commander.

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.160
I am willing to lead the troops

00:30:39.319 --> 00:30:41.319
and complete this arduous task.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.480
No rush, no rush.

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.319
I am a greedy man.

00:30:48.039 --> 00:30:49.799
I want one more thing.

00:30:50.079 --> 00:30:51.240
Please enlighten us, Commander.

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.440
The regimental commander sent by the allies this time

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:56.880
is a bandit leader,

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.279
and also the hero who killed the Japanese,

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:00.720
Fan Pengju.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.119
He is a talent.

00:31:03.039 --> 00:31:04.240
Everyone knows I cherish talent.

00:31:05.519 --> 00:31:06.559
Sending you...

00:31:07.039 --> 00:31:08.920
would that make things difficult for you?

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.000
Well...

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:10.839
Division Commander Chen,

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.920
Commander Qin came up with the strategy.

00:31:14.039 --> 00:31:17.319
So it is most appropriate for Commander Qin to lead the troops.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:18.920
And I believe,

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.960
Commander Qin is a man who sees the big picture.

00:31:21.559 --> 00:31:23.799
I am willing to accompany Commander Qin

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.039
and lend a helping hand.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:26.920
Do you two take me for a fool?

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.319
Think I don't know you're settling private scores?

00:31:31.359 --> 00:31:33.039
Haven't you scrubbed enough toilets?

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.279
That is exactly why I must go.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.279
Serving as a staff officer under Division Commander Chen,

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.160
one must act like a staff officer.

00:31:40.519 --> 00:31:42.160
So I want to take this opportunity

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:43.640
to correct my previous mistakes.

00:31:44.039 --> 00:31:45.000
To let everyone know,

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.559
when it comes to Division Commander Chen's interests,

00:31:46.799 --> 00:31:49.599
my personal grievances are trivial.

00:31:51.359 --> 00:31:52.480
So, Commander Qin,

00:31:53.079 --> 00:31:54.759
are you willing to sign a military pledge?

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:56.759
A military pledge?

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:06.079
Commander,

00:32:06.279 --> 00:32:07.839
I am willing to sign a military pledge.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:09.680
In accordance with your instructions,

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.000
to complete the mission.
