WEBVTT

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:06.290
How is it?

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.080
It's still just a draft,

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.760
but I think it looks great.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.450
Thank you.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.090
Natsume-san.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.359
It turned out really well.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.670
Don't be so shy.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.700
You must be used to it by now.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.150
Oh, about that...

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.650
There's something I should
have confirmed earlier...

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.380
You two aren't suddenly
going to quit ROMY, are you?

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:32.890
Huh?

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.260
After all, I'm the one who
asked you to shoot this.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.370
I hope you'll stay a bit longer.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.310
I won't quit.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.200
I still have many dreams to achieve.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.250
Me too.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.530
I see.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.250
I'm relieved to hear that.

00:00:48.833 --> 00:00:49.833
Ah.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.270
Sorry, I'll be right back.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.570
Hello, this is Tanouchi.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.900
Yes.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.740
Oh dear.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.720
He's still so shy.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.210
Isn't that good?

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.540
These are precious photos of
Natsume-san, the future number one BA.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.146
You're making fun of me, aren't you?

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.170
No, I'm not.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.960
Hmm, I wanted to find
something to tease you about,

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.110
but you have no weaknesses.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.530
I feel like you've become more handsome.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.740
Huh?

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.780
Hmm...

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.090
Is it because your goal is clear? Ever since
you said you want to be a top makeup artist,

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.710
your whole demeanor has
become more composed.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.160
Isn't it because Natsume-san likes me?

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.200
I'm genuinely complimenting you.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.510
Then of course I'd become more handsome.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.820
Because I'm by Natsume-san's side.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.400
What kind of twisted logic is that?

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:51.539
That's right.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.460
I have dreams I want to achieve.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.710
So many of them.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.410
Together with Toma.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.820
Toma.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.940
Let's do our best together.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.800
Okay.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.600
Cosmetic Playlover Season 2
(Episode 3)

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.660
Speaking of which,

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.060
when will you be going to Paris?

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.070
I just spoke with HR.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.270
Emma already contacted headquarters.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:25.930
I see.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.186
After that, there are various
procedures like getting a visa.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.289
If all goes well,

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.776
the official appointment will probably
be made at the end of the fiscal year.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.030
End of the fiscal year...

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.470
So, March.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.280
Yes.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.350
Actually,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.030
I've been thinking
about something recently.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.040
What is it?

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.960
Didn't I say I wanted to become
'the best BA'?

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.530
But I've been wondering
what that truly means.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.070
Then I remembered former Chief Harada.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.170
Chief Harada...

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.980
Ah, she's a trainer now, right?

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.530
Yes, I ran into her at a
headquarters meeting the other day.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.950
She told me a lot about
her work as a trainer.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.980
I thought that training new
employees might be a good path too.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.760
In that case, Natsume-san,

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.330
are you going to leave the counter?

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:17.650
No.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.570
I really enjoy serving customers.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.190
I still want to be on
the front lines for now.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
However,

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.890
once I've grown a bit more,

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:27.839
and gained different
kinds of experiences,

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.870
there might be an option to
pursue that path in the future.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:37.910
Hmm?

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:41.940
Isn't that great?

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.050
Natsume-san, you can do
anything you set your mind to.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.310
Ah...

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.440
So, it's going to be
posted in our store too...

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.880
Manager Mamiya.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.400
Isn't he handsome?

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.200
And Sahashi-kun is amazing too.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.350
As expected of a former
model, he has great presence.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.840
Sahashi is fine, but me...

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.779
Oh, come on!

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.299
You're the pride of our cohort.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.919
You're a manager we're proud of.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.760
Ah... no, no, please.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.000
Don't say things like that.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.490
- Oh, he's shy.
- He's shy.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:25.900
Alright, you guys.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.780
- Back to work, back to work!
- Yes!

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:31.840
It's really good.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.170
- Huh?
- Even better than I imagined.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.710
Thank you.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.330
By the way, it really turned out well.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.280
Sahashi-kun, you didn't
go pressure PR, did you?

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.320
Saying they absolutely had to
use Mamiya-kun as the model.

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.410
I just said that if they were
going to focus on male staff,

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.740
it would be more suitable
to feature Natsume-san.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.310
The fact that he was chosen is a
testament to Natsume-san's own ability.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.080
Hmm.

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:14.206
I heard the news.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.880
So, you'll be parting ways in spring?

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.960
I knew it.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.060
I had a feeling Sahashi-kun
would catch Emma's eye.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.440
Huh?

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.880
What do you mean?

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:34.270
So,

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:39.790
I told Emma, 'There's a guy who seems
to fit the talent you're looking for.'

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.876
Why would you go out of your
way to do something like that?

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.300
You should have just left it alone.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.940
I don't like having more and
more ties holding me back.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.640
So,

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.920
I'm not interested in
promotions or anything like that.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.680
To be able to work freely,

00:06:55.796 --> 00:06:57.476
I need to do favors for promising juniors,

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.790
and for the company.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.760
That's my survival strategy.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.240
But you know,

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.270
joining Emma's team

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.280
is a really big deal.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:15.799
- You should do your best...
- Stop.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.800
Huh?

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:21.200
I only need Natsume-san to cheer me on.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.180
They're already being lovey-dovey.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.240
There's really no opening at all.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:27.680
But still, thank you.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.540
I appreciate the sentiment.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.326
(I'll be busy for a bit
longer, you go to sleep first.)

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:42.730
If I don't go to sleep first,
he'll probably refuse to work.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.680
Do... your best...

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:55.070
Alright...

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:31.400
Just come back soon...

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:10.850
I'm home.

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:13.650
Welcome home.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.040
Sorry, did I wake you?

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.200
No.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.340
I just wanted to say 'welcome home' to you.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.200
I also love it when you
say 'welcome home'.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:35.470
I was able to get through it
because your photo was in the store.

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:41.470
Well, yeah...

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.230
Of course, it'll be posted
in the Ginza store too.

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:49.970
But it just made me want
to see you even more.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.800
I see.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.890
The real thing is still the best.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.350
Oh no! We... overslept!

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.609
No need to panic so much.

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:29.340
Looks like there's no time for breakfast.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.450
Just grab something quick to eat.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.040
Then, at least a kiss.

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:36.900
Hey, you...

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:47.170
Didn't you say we don't have time?

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:49.190
I'm talking about you!

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:53.950
Okay.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:55.610
We'll make it in time like this.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.520
That's why I said there's no need to rush.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.350
Natsume-san is just too serious.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.080
If I were serious,

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:02.930
I wouldn't have
overslept in the first place.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:06.930
Today's defeat was caused
by hitting snooze twice.

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:12.980
By the way,

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.030
the Ginza store is starting a
limited-time event soon, right?

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.320
Yes.

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:20.610
They'll be selling limited edition products
and re-releasing discontinued shades.

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:23.190
Our store mostly has
makeup artists and experts,

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.080
so we'll plan things to
leverage that strength.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:26.700
I see.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.359
Our store also just released new products,

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.400
and reservations for
makeup sets are starting soon.

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:33.750
We need to stay focused and work hard.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:35.660
Yes.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.680
I'll go this way then.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:58.450
Please confirm the items you've selected.

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:00.920
Okay, no problem.

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:04.769
Oh, that's great. This item is
already sold out at the Ginza store.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:06.696
I'm glad you still have
it here, it's a great help.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.030
That's wonderful.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.420
The Ginza store has
been very popular recently.

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:14.730
Sahashi-san was already hard to book,

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.580
and now it feels even harder.

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:19.110
I apologize for the inconvenience.

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.520
If it's a product sold in our store,

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.199
you're always welcome to come here.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.280
Thank you.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:27.520
- I'll wrap it for you now, please wait a moment.
- Okay.

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:31.330
Let's eat.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.320
That guy...

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:44.340
Even after finishing his training,
he seems to be very busy.

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.840
I hope he's eating lunch properly.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.640
Hello, thank you for your hard work.

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:02.230
Huh?

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:03.550
He's transferring here?

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:08.930
Yes, it's a transfer, actually, he's a new
BA who just joined the company this year.

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:13.030
After training, he was
assigned to the Ikebukuro store,

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:15.240
but it doesn't seem to be going well.

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:17.210
He seems very troubled.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:22.982
So the company discussed transferring
him to the Shinonome Yurakucho store,

00:13:23.007 --> 00:13:25.160
which has a good record
with male makeup artists.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:30.530
It's well-known within the company that
you, Natsume, trained Sahashi-kun after all.

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:32.750
So that means,

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.020
he's a male BA?

00:13:34.373 --> 00:13:35.373
That's right.

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:36.950
What do you think?

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.340
Of course, I'm willing.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.640
If I can be of help.

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:42.590
That's great.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:44.500
Thank you.

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:45.770
I'll leave it to you then.

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:48.399
If there's anything I can do for my junior,

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.460
I'll do my best.

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.316
Did you successfully place the order
for the batch we discussed yesterday?

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:00.680
Yes, it's already ordered.

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:03.420
So I think it should arrive
in time for next week's event.

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:04.570
Okay.

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:06.280
Good morning.

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:16.510
I'm Hoshina Riku, assigned to the
Shinonome Yurakucho store starting today.

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:18.470
Nice to meet you.

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:21.420
Huh?

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:22.910
You're...

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:26.190
Are you Mamiya-san?

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:29.860
The winner of the the Rookie of the Year
award in management at the awards ceremony...?

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:33.410
Good morning.

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:34.950
I'm Manager Mamiya.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:39.010
Hoshina-kun, didn't you talk
to me at headquarters before?

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.030
Yes.

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.099
- You remember me?
- Ah, it was you after all.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:42.890
I'm so happy.

00:14:42.891 --> 00:14:44.990
Do you two know each other?

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.850
We talked once before.

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:49.880
I'm Sasaki, nice to meet you.

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:51.410
I'm Takano.

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:52.630
Nice to meet you.

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.020
I'm Sub-Chief Aizawa.

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.119
Customers here are
already used to male BAs.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.370
Don't feel pressured, just relax and work.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.640
If you don't understand
anything, feel free to ask anytime.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:09.130
I... I'm Hoshina.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.540
Nice to meet you.

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:16.860
Alright everyone, let's keep smiling today,

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:18.680
and do our best together.

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:20.390
Nice to meet you.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:25.020
Alright, Hoshina-kun.

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.820
I'll show you around the procedures first.

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:27.550
Yes.

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:28.780
Well...

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:32.820
I think the layout should be
similar to the Ikebukuro store.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.080
First,

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.440
- We manage inventory with this computer.
- Yes.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.270
Then, here are the skincare products.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.000
- And here's the base makeup.
- Yes.

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:44.170
And here are the testers.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.460
Here are the tools for makeup application.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.520
Okay, I understand.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.610
I heard he transferred
because he was having trouble,

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.470
but he doesn't seem like it.

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:01.370
I'll keep an eye on him.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.820
Alright, Hoshina-kun.

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:05.700
It's almost opening time.

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:08.470
Can you try serving customers
the same way you used to?

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:10.130
Huh?

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.150
Can I serve customers right away?

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.400
Of course.

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:16.910
Okay.

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:32.290
Welcome.

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:34.950
Welcome.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.580
Are you looking for anything in particular?

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.460
Today, I'd like to try
some eyebrow products.

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:49.930
Okay, I understand.

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:51.490
Please come this way.

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:03.660
- I'll put this cape on you first.
- Okay.

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:10.000
Excuse me, pardon me.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:11.920
Excuse me.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.610
I'll just tidy up your hair a bit.

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:21.930
Hmm?

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:24.180
I'll clip your bangs up for you.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.600
His technique seems a bit clumsy.

00:17:30.677 --> 00:17:32.727
And the stretches of silence are so long.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.450
Are you new?

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.300
Yes.

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:41.719
I just joined the company
this year, and after training...

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.466
- I just transferred here today.
- His hands stopped when he started talking.

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:45.520
I see.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.960
Yes.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:49.910
Hmm...

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.180
I feel like my skin type
has changed recently.

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:55.610
It's become very dry, I'd say.

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:58.329
I wonder if I should change
my skincare products.

00:17:58.330 --> 00:17:59.980
Ah... I...

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:01.850
No, that's... I'm sorry.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.860
I also have dry skin.

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:07.350
It's really troublesome, isn't it?

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:08.470
- Right.
- Ah, no.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:09.560
That's not it.

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:11.276
You need to listen more
carefully to the customer's concerns.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.390
My makeup doesn't
sit well recently either.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.750
- Oh, that must be tough.
- It is.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.299
(15 minutes later)

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.580
I have a dog at home.

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.030
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:21.810
I used to have one too.

00:18:21.811 --> 00:18:23.289
Oh? What breed?

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:24.499
Mine was a Corgi.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:25.820
Oh, mine too!

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:26.720
- Huh? The same?
- Yes.

00:18:26.721 --> 00:18:28.880
He's talking about dogs.

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.300
How cute.

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:33.070
I can't leave him alone.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:34.920
Its name was Pudding.

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:37.900
What about recently? Do
you still have a dog now?

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:38.910
Not anymore.

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:39.860
I see.

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:40.860
But I have a cat.

00:18:40.861 --> 00:18:42.270
- Oh? A cat?
- Yes.

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:43.450
Alright then,

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.010
everyone, good work today.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.640
Good work.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.360
Do you want to go eat later?

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.520
How about dumplings?

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:53.650
Sure, let's go.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:55.520
Ah, Hoshina-kun.

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:56.930
Yes.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.856
We have the same way
home for part of the way, right?

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:00.880
Yes.

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:02.950
Want to walk together?

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.470
Okay, of course.

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:09.260
So that's how it is.

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:10.710
Yes.

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:14.940
At my previous counter, I was hardly
ever assigned to serve customers.

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:16.980
Was it the manager's policy?

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:18.160
No.

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:20.380
I studied diligently during training,

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:22.780
and I was quite confident.

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.340
So when I was first assigned there,

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:26.390
I did have opportunities
to serve customers, but...

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:31.370
Maybe I was too nervous.

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:34.450
I would mix up product numbers,

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.310
or often get the service procedures wrong.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.940
After customers pointed it out,

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:42.550
I became even more flustered.

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:45.300
Everyone's like that at first.

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.440
But...

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.770
I started to feel scared afterwards.

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:54.450
Since then, I've basically been

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.750
doing cleaning or packaging,

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:58.990
and tasks like working
the counter or restocking.

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:03.040
I've been doing work that doesn't
involve customer interaction.

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:07.830
I...

00:20:08.772 --> 00:20:11.982
I was still thinking I wanted to work
hard to become like Mamiya-san...

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:15.430
By the way,

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:18.130
when I met you three months ago,

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.026
I read your article in
the in-house magazine.

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:23.730
I really want to be like Mamiya-san too.

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:26.320
Um... I...

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:27.890
I'll do my best.

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:30.810
His eyes were sparkling
so brightly back then.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.820
Is being a BA not the right fit for me?

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:41.200
That's not true at all.

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:45.450
Nervousness is just a
matter of inexperience.

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.810
You can't give up just
because of one mistake.

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:49.670
But...

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:51.780
- I can't cause any more trouble...
- It's okay.

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:56.000
For now, let's serve customers together.

00:20:57.610 --> 00:20:59.050
Although it will mean overtime,

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.180
let's practice makeup
application together too.

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:03.950
Okay.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.400
Hmm.

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.340
Hoshina-kun, why did
you want to become a BA?

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:15.570
Well...

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:20.560
It's kind of like habitual
underdog thing...

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.410
Habitual underdog?

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.640
So it's not because you're
interested in makeup?

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.550
To be honest, I'm not very interested.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:28.700
Huh?

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:32.360
In college,

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:36.040
the girl I liked was a fan of Sahashi-san.

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:37.690
I see.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:43.720
I thought, 'so that's how
you become popular...'

00:21:44.493 --> 00:21:46.513
Though there were
various other reasons too.

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.360
It was mostly on an impulse.

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:50.650
So that's how it was.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.790
That's a rare motivation.

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:56.220
I'm sorry... I know my
motivation isn't pure.

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:58.530
No, no, I don't think that at all.

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:03.230
Um...

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:05.340
Hmm?

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:10.080
Can I ask a question?

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:12.700
Yes, what is it?

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:18.450
What does it feel like

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:20.460
to love your job?

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:23.970
Huh?

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.400
Oh.

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.400
Still here?

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:45.450
I'm practicing with the model
I'll be in charge of for the show.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.200
Hmm.

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.230
Sahashi-kun, you've really changed.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.640
I never thought you'd become
so dedicated to your work.

00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:57.790
As expected...

00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:59.090
Is it Mamiya-kun's influence?

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:06.740
Yeah, I guess so.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.340
Oh~

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:09.490
What kind of influence?

00:23:09.676 --> 00:23:11.036
Tell your big brother here.

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:12.926
Under no circumstance would I say.

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:15.290
Wow, I completely take
back what I said earlier.

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:18.250
You haven't changed at all in that regard.

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:22.620
Alright, I'm heading off.

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:25.280
Good work.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:41.440
I couldn't answer
Hoshina-kun's question properly.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.200
Work...

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:46.450
Although there are tough times,

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:49.900
I really enjoy serving customers.

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.919
I'm happy when customers are happy.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.670
- Please take your time to try it.
- Okay.

00:23:58.980 --> 00:23:59.980
Huh?

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:03.320
Isn't that just my personal
feeling about work?

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:08.070
Maybe I should consult Toma...

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:14.400
Since I've taken this on,

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.930
I can't say 'I can't do it after all'.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000
As a manager,

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:21.540
as a senior male BA,

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:23.590
and most importantly...

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:27.140
I really want to be like Mamiya-san too.

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:34.060
That phrase...

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.480
It really made me happy.

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:40.660
Even if he wasn't very interested at first,

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:41.980
even if it was just a whim,

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.760
he once thought that way.

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.410
There must be some breakthrough.

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:50.730
Okay.

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:54.580
No matter what, I will...

00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:57.520
train Hoshina-kun to become a capable BA.

00:24:57.790 --> 00:24:58.790
Okay.

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:02.990
Okay what?

00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:04.190
Huh?

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.820
Toma, welcome home.

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:11.150
I'm home.

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:12.410
What's wrong?

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:14.730
You'll catch a cold, dry yourself first.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.110
I know.

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:20.720
Actually, today,

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:23.030
a new male employee joined our counter.

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:24.620
Ah, do you remember?

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:26.570
The one who spoke to
me at headquarters before.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:27.760
Ah...

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:29.090
Hmm.

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:31.020
His name is Hoshina.

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.680
I was wondering how I could
make him enjoy his work.

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:35.150
Hmm?

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:37.820
You really are a workaholic, aren't you?

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:39.390
Is that bad?

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.040
It's not bad, but...

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:43.730
when you're at home,

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.360
please think of me.

00:25:46.193 --> 00:25:47.393
I am thinking of you.

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:50.010
Or actually, I'm thinking
of you all the time.

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:51.610
That's good.

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:01.430
This is my 'welcome home' kiss.

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:07.730
I'm going to blow-dry my hair.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.049
Do you want me to help you?

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:14.050
No, thanks.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:16.589
(Next Episode)
That's your regular customer, right?

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:17.240
Are you really okay leaving them to him?

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.150
I...

00:26:18.151 --> 00:26:19.580
I'll take full responsibility.

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:21.919
Being too meddlesome
can backfire, you know.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.126
Why does that sound a bit angry?

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:25.130
Trust yourself for choosing this BA,

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:27.000
and try a little harder, okay?
