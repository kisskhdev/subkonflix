00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:54.359
Uncle Shan

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.519
Uncle Shan

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.799
Uncle Shan

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:58.260
You can't go out this door

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:59.620
Imperial Physician Sun said

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:00.180
That you...

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.000
The soft tissue needs rest

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:03.560
Get lost

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.739
I know my own tissue

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.000
It's none of your business

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:07.840
Don't! Move aside!

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.500
No way

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.219
Let me out

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:10.139
No

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.120
If you walk out this door

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.539
I can't take responsibility for it

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.259
Then don't take responsibility

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:16.860
You keep wrestling with me like this

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.139
You keep wrestling with me like this

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:18.960
I'm telling you

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.639
If my soft tissue gets hurt again

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:21.840
You really won't be able to

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.340
Afford the responsibility

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.659
Uncle Shan, oh my good Lord!

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.879
Can you stop making things hard for me?

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:32.580
The security team is cutting staff these days

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.759
Move

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:35.300
Stop

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:37.460
Don't make a mess

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.039
Listen to me

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:42.020
Old folks love to scam people

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:45.319
Uncle Shan

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.379
Why did you run out of your room?

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.379
Is that any of your business?

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:51.520
This old man's words are really biting

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:55.360
You think I want to mind your business?

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:58.340
I abhor evil, and when I see injustice...

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.599
I take action when it's called for

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.300
Shoo

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.180
Go back to your room

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.259
Boss Li

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:07.280
Boss Li

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:09.120
Just let me go out

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:10.319
For a couple of laps

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.659
Just two laps

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.439
Okay?

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:14.479
Walk a couple of laps

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.180
That's not right

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.120
You usually like staying in your room alone

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:20.780
Your soft tissue is injured

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.199
Why did you suddenly think of going for a walk?

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.840
That's right

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.340
I get it

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:27.419
Let's go

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.199
I'll walk a couple of laps with you

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:31.520
What did you figure out?

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.159
I figured out the thief business from last night

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:34.439
Let's go

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:35.300
I'll go walk with you

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:36.599
Let's go

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:58.360
Suspicious character.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.759
Suspicious character.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.460
What are you talking about?

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:04.900
Look closely at who I am.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.960
A famous movie star's...

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:08.080
...father.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.860
Mr. Liang.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.900
It's...

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:12.039
...getting dark out.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.479
Why are you still wearing sunglasses?

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.319
Dressing like that to walk the dog...

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:17.920
...isn't that suspicious?

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:18.860
I feel like it.

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:20.740
If these clothes get dirty,

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.100
my daughter buys me new ones.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.040
Say, Professor Fan,

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:26.839
I heard there's a thief in our community.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.560
Instead of helping catch the thief or analyzing the case,

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.000
what are you wandering around here for?

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.560
I am...

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.220
...analyzing the case right now.

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:35.240
No leads.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.199
When it comes to catching thieves,

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.160
ten of you tied together...

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.959
...aren't as good as my dog.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.339
How so?

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:47.939
Just yesterday afternoon,

00:04:49.079 --> 00:04:49.819
this dog of ours,

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:50.720
Bell here...

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.379
...wanted to enter the community,

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.579
but those two dumb guards wouldn't let him in.

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:56.259
If they had just let him in sooner,

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:57.459
whatever kind of thief it was,

00:04:57.459 --> 00:04:58.800
he would have taken them down for you.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.459
I get it now.

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:04.620
You get it, right?

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.199
What do you get?

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.959
You are that thief.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.939
What are you saying?

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:09.720
You're the thief!

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.779
You're the thief!

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:11.839
Your whole family are thieves!

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:12.699
Your ancestors were all thieves!

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:13.160
You...

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:14.699
Me, a thief?

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:16.379
I am a famous movie star's...

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:17.439
...father!

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:18.680
I know.

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:20.439
What I mean is,

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.500
I'm not saying you...

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.839
...are a real thief.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.420
It's just that yesterday,

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:25.139
the guards...

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.540
...wouldn't let Bell into the community.

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:27.980
So at night,

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.480
you came in pretending to be a thief.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.600
That way,

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:31.759
during the day today,

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:32.480
they would allow...

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.579
...dogs into the community.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.839
Tell me, is my analysis correct?

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:35.180
Am I right or not?

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.240
Your analysis is crap.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.100
Right about what?

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:38.180
Preposterous.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.959
Let me ask you first,

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.019
what did our community lose?

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.259
That's just it, nothing was lost!

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:44.839
So,

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.560
that means this thief...

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.879
...didn't come to steal things.

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:49.860
He came to scare people.

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:50.800
To scare people.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.740
Just admit it.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.560
Come close the case with me.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.519
Admit what?

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:54.740
Close what case?

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:55.939
You think our Bell...

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:57.480
...is so desperate to enter this community?

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.600
Me, pretending to be a thief?

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.360
Scaring people for fun?

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.560
Do I have nothing better to do?

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.800
Who am I?

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:02.660
I'll say it again.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.860
A famous movie star's...

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:04.600
...father.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.860
Good that you know.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.899
Let's go, Bell.

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:30.399
He's really been wronged.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.519
You definitely wrongly accused him.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.379
The thief isn't Mr. Liang.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.459
Is that so?

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:37.879
How can you be so sure?

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.160
Of course.

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:41.120
Because I know who the thief is.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.360
Who is it?

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.819
Why should I tell you?

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.199
Didn't you say you were...

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.220
More-or-Less?

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.680
You speak first.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.920
After you finish, I'll tell you where you're wrong.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.939
In my opinion...

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.240
So I've become the negative example?

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:54.220
Fine.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.899
I'll share my brilliant analysis...

00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:56.420
...with you.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.779
You should learn a thing or two.

00:06:58.459 --> 00:06:59.300
Currently...

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:01.100
There are a few possibilities.

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:02.660
The first one...

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.740
Is that Ms. Liu and Xiao Cai are lying.

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:07.319
Nonsense.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.160
Don't you dare slander Ms. Liu.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.459
I haven't finished yet.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.899
I just want to say...

00:07:12.459 --> 00:07:14.319
This possibility doesn't exist.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.019
Because that black shadow...

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.519
I saw it too.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:20.959
What happened?

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:24.899
What was that sound?

00:07:25.459 --> 00:07:26.959
I think I saw a black shadow.

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:29.160
Whoosh past the window.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.920
So the first possibility doesn't exist.

00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:34.120
If it's not possible, why mention it?

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:35.420
Hurry up and say the second one.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:36.879
The second one...

00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:38.800
Is that Mr. Liang...

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.060
To reasonably...

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.300
And legally bring the dog into the community...

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:43.839
Is playing tricks.

00:07:43.899 --> 00:07:44.759
This is also impossible.

00:07:45.259 --> 00:07:46.420
Go straight to the third one.

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:47.819
The third one is...

00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:50.279
Rumor has it that our Willow New Town retirement community...

00:07:50.379 --> 00:07:52.060
Is going to cut security staff soon.

00:07:52.439 --> 00:07:53.420
In other words...

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.680
A Jian and A Qiang...

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.259
Are at risk of being laid off.

00:07:56.699 --> 00:07:57.379
So...

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.300
Could they be...

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.300
Striving hard to achieve the Four Modernizations...

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.579
Our tomorrow...

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.300
Is sweeter than honey.

00:08:23.339 --> 00:08:27.279
Tomorrow...

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:31.600
Tomorrow is sweeter than honey.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.259
There isn't such a high note at the end, right?

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.679
Hooligan!

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:38.419
Hooligan!

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:38.899
Where?

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.340
Don't be afraid, Xiao Cai. Xiao Cai.

00:08:41.519 --> 00:08:41.899
Don't be afraid.

00:08:41.899 --> 00:08:42.379
Don't be afraid.

00:08:42.379 --> 00:08:43.460
It's okay.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:44.120
Ms. Liu.

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:45.919
What's wrong?

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:46.840
What's going on?

00:08:46.919 --> 00:08:47.460
What is it?

00:08:47.759 --> 00:08:48.440
Is there a problem?

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.419
What happened?

00:08:50.059 --> 00:08:51.360
You mean...

00:08:51.659 --> 00:08:53.820
It's A Jian and A Qiang...

00:08:54.059 --> 00:08:55.220
Crying thief to catch a thief?

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.559
Is that possible?

00:08:56.799 --> 00:08:58.759
Ms. Liu mistook a baton for a knife?

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.740
The lighting was bad, she couldn't see clearly.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:02.720
Impossible.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.740
Even if I don't have the correct answer...

00:09:06.519 --> 00:09:08.220
I don't believe these two kids...

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.899
Could do something like this.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.320
The two of them helped me save Uncle Shan.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.480
I know them well.

00:09:15.419 --> 00:09:16.679
Are there any other possibilities?

00:09:16.919 --> 00:09:17.679
Currently...

00:09:18.419 --> 00:09:19.759
There are only these three possibilities.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And you're just...

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.059
More-or-Less.

00:09:25.919 --> 00:09:27.759
More like a total mess.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.059
Then you tell me...

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:30.899
Who is it really?

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.500
Listen up

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.940
Today

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.100
I was pushing Uncle Shan

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.019
around the neighborhood for ages before I figured it out

00:09:43.159 --> 00:09:44.360
This thief

00:09:45.259 --> 00:09:46.659
is none other than

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:47.860
Uncle Shan himself

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:48.919
That's right

00:09:50.299 --> 00:09:51.159
What do you mean "that's right"?

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.679
With Uncle Shan's flimsy physique

00:09:53.759 --> 00:09:55.899
a face-plant could cause a soft tissue contusion

00:09:56.659 --> 00:09:58.460
Could he handle the heavy task of a cat burglar?

00:09:59.379 --> 00:10:01.279
Then you tell me, who is it?

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.399
It was Director Chang

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.279
who invited...

00:10:09.019 --> 00:10:10.960
The thief invited by Director Chang

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.820
Boss Li, are you okay?

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.220
Speaking of which

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.980
last week

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:17.539
Boss Li

00:10:18.279 --> 00:10:18.879
my old boss

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:20.340
Sit

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:21.879
Thanks

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:24.960
You wanted to see me about...

00:10:25.039 --> 00:10:25.779
I came here

00:10:26.799 --> 00:10:29.100
with a few suggestions for community development

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.940
Not as a leader, mind you

00:10:31.919 --> 00:10:33.139
just representing myself

00:10:33.659 --> 00:10:34.960
for Director Chang's consideration

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.200
It's fine, go ahead

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:38.440
Director Chang

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:40.340
Boss Li and Director Chang

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.940
are discussing major state affairs

00:10:42.039 --> 00:10:43.139
Community affairs

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.299
Is it urgent?

00:10:44.759 --> 00:10:45.840
It is quite urgent

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:47.539
Then we shouldn't disturb them

00:10:47.539 --> 00:10:48.039
Right

00:10:48.419 --> 00:10:49.539
You can say it later

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:51.039
Director Chang, come

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:51.879
I need to

00:10:51.899 --> 00:10:52.580
report something to you

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:54.000
Go ahead

00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:56.399
Our...

00:10:56.539 --> 00:10:57.940
cafeteria buffet

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.539
is it only for eating there

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.639
and not for taking away?

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.360
In principle, yes

00:11:04.799 --> 00:11:06.059
That Uncle Shan

00:11:06.279 --> 00:11:07.059
Shan

00:11:07.639 --> 00:11:08.759
he's no saint

00:11:09.019 --> 00:11:10.019
Alright, please continue

00:11:10.159 --> 00:11:12.460
Every time that Uncle Shan finishes a meal

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.519
he stuffs fruit in his pocket to take back

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:16.620
Is that so?

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.080
Every single time

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.200
Just now

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.980
he took two oranges back

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.940
You say, of all things to steal

00:11:23.019 --> 00:11:24.759
he just has to steal oranges

00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:26.799
Well, regarding stealing oranges

00:11:27.539 --> 00:11:29.740
it is well-documented in history

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:30.480
For example

00:11:30.659 --> 00:11:32.000
Lu Ji of the Three Kingdoms

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.700
at Yuan Shu's banquet

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.899
stole a few oranges

00:11:34.919 --> 00:11:35.559
to take back

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.000
to honor his mother

00:11:38.039 --> 00:11:39.840
Professor Fan, can you listen to me properly

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:40.899
without interrupting?

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.299
I heard you mention stealing oranges

00:11:43.399 --> 00:11:44.659
so I thought of this classic story

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.000
Showing off your knowledge

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.220
Get out

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:48.580
Listen properly

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.120
Okay

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.080
I'm leaving

00:11:50.139 --> 00:11:50.980
I'm leaving, alright

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.059
If you don't handle this matter

00:11:56.379 --> 00:11:57.700
Then starting tomorrow

00:11:57.799 --> 00:11:59.340
I'll start pocketing fruit too

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.419
I won't take those oranges

00:12:01.419 --> 00:12:02.840
I'll pick out the bananas

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.000
Fine

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:04.879
Auntie Cai

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.100
Don't worry, I'll definitely handle this well

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:08.059
Just rest assured

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:09.539
Can I rest assured?

00:12:10.299 --> 00:12:11.399
Just that old man Shan

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.059
Pulling a long face all day and never leaving his room

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.700
And muttering away in there

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.539
Talking to himself, saying nasty things

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:18.500
Tell me

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:20.559
Is he neurotic?

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:21.559
Look at what you're saying

00:12:21.559 --> 00:12:22.799
If he has an episode one day

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:23.460
And

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:24.519
Hits people or something

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.519
Self-harm or hurting others shouldn't happen

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.600
Actually, regarding his situation

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.639
I have a basic understanding

00:12:31.279 --> 00:12:32.960
The old gentleman does indeed show signs of

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.240
Some sort of emotional disorder

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.500
I will find someone to resolve it

00:12:35.919 --> 00:12:36.759
According to

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.639
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.419
And Freud's dream interpretation

00:12:40.799 --> 00:12:41.759
These reasons

00:12:41.759 --> 00:12:42.539
You talk too much

00:12:42.539 --> 00:12:43.480
I'll just listen to you

00:12:43.899 --> 00:12:45.480
Just get him sorted out soon

00:12:46.259 --> 00:12:48.139
Get that disorder of his sorted out

00:12:51.799 --> 00:12:53.840
Director Chang said he'd find someone to solve it

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:56.340
He should have hired a psychologist

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.399
I haven't heard of hiring a thief

00:12:58.919 --> 00:13:01.100
That's why I say you scholars have rigid minds

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.159
Didn't I tell you?

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.559
I walked around with Uncle Shan for a long time

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:07.980
He's not that "disordered" now

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.559
Looking left and right all over the community

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:12.779
Wandering east and turning west

00:13:12.779 --> 00:13:14.240
Sitting here, standing there

00:13:15.259 --> 00:13:17.259
Although his legs aren't very nimble

00:13:18.519 --> 00:13:20.679
His gaze is piercing

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:22.700
So I think

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.519
This is how Director Chang arranged it

00:13:26.179 --> 00:13:27.240
So

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:29.279
We're asking you to pose as a thief

00:13:29.279 --> 00:13:31.100
To commit theft in the community

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.580
And lead everyone

00:13:32.759 --> 00:13:35.919
To the vicinity of Uncle Shan's residence

00:13:36.779 --> 00:13:37.559
Understood

00:13:38.679 --> 00:13:39.299
Why?

00:13:42.159 --> 00:13:44.240
That way Uncle Shan can see

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:45.799
When an accident happens

00:13:45.879 --> 00:13:48.399
How much everyone cares for and protects him

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:51.519
Let him feel everyone's warmth, and won't he

00:13:52.519 --> 00:13:54.700
Suddenly see the light?

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.419
Do I need to push Uncle Shan over?

00:14:00.059 --> 00:14:01.679
So everyone can take care of him?

00:14:02.039 --> 00:14:02.860
Good ide...

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:03.899
No, that won't do

00:14:03.899 --> 00:14:04.679
Okay

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.299
After you're done

00:14:07.039 --> 00:14:08.200
You're a fresh face

00:14:08.279 --> 00:14:10.559
Remember to come back to me quickly

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:11.799
Don't worry

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:13.460
At my place

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:16.019
No one will be able to find you

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:22.639
Well?

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.379
You get it now, right?

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:25.500
I get it.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.980
I get that you're a self-righteous...

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:29.460
...big muddle-head.

00:14:29.539 --> 00:14:30.179
How can you

00:14:31.279 --> 00:14:32.259
compliment someone like that?

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.059
Do you have any common sense?

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.440
If the thief was hired by Director Chang,

00:14:37.659 --> 00:14:39.620
wouldn't he warn everyone?

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.080
Just to help one person,

00:14:41.139 --> 00:14:42.379
he's stirred up the whole community

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.480
so there's no peace.

00:14:43.539 --> 00:14:45.220
Is this something a director should do?

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.299
That's why I say you...

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.460
...study dead books.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:48.799
...read books to death.

00:14:49.139 --> 00:14:50.139
...read undying books.

00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:50.659
No.

00:14:50.899 --> 00:14:51.840
...die not reading books.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.139
How does it go?

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.259
It's called mechanical studying.

00:14:54.259 --> 00:14:55.179
Reading without thinking.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.000
Better not to read than to read yourself to death.

00:14:58.019 --> 00:14:58.639
See?

00:14:59.139 --> 00:15:00.139
You said it yourself.

00:15:02.879 --> 00:15:04.360
I remember someone saying...

00:15:06.759 --> 00:15:08.179
There are four people tied to a track,

00:15:09.139 --> 00:15:10.659
and one person tied to the side track.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:12.139
The train is coming.

00:15:12.559 --> 00:15:13.419
If you do nothing,

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.179
it kills the four people.

00:15:15.779 --> 00:15:16.700
If you switch the tracks,

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.320
you can save the four people,

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:19.320
but kill the one person.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.899
I told you that.

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.360
It's called the trolley problem.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.059
It belongs to the realm of philosophy.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.159
In real life,

00:15:26.159 --> 00:15:27.159
would that work?

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.200
Let's not guess blindly.

00:15:29.299 --> 00:15:31.200
We'll know if we ask Director Chang tomorrow.

00:15:31.259 --> 00:15:33.059
Ask then. Who's afraid of whom?

00:15:33.259 --> 00:15:35.159
If the thief was hired by Director Chang,

00:15:35.399 --> 00:15:36.340
what will you bet me?

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.000
If I lose,

00:15:38.059 --> 00:15:39.700
I'll give you a hardcover edition of

00:15:39.759 --> 00:15:40.740
the Great Chinese Dictionary.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:41.320
Get out.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:41.960
I don't want that.

00:15:43.679 --> 00:15:44.580
If you lose,

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.899
you treat me to a premium edition roast duck.

00:15:49.759 --> 00:15:50.799
If I lose,

00:15:51.279 --> 00:15:52.460
I'll treat you.

00:15:52.799 --> 00:15:53.340
Fine.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.899
No matter who pays,

00:15:55.059 --> 00:15:56.519
I'm definitely eating that duck.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.080
Director Chang.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:05.399
Boss Li, Professor Fan.

00:16:07.659 --> 00:16:09.259
Do you two have business with me?

00:16:11.139 --> 00:16:12.899
We did have something to ask you,

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:14.779
but seeing this gentleman...

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.379
This gentleman...

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:19.779
You hired this gentleman, right?

00:16:20.799 --> 00:16:21.299
Yes.

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:23.320
How did you know?

00:16:23.799 --> 00:16:25.059
Who am I?

00:16:25.799 --> 00:16:27.019
I could tell at a glance

00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:28.000
what was going on.

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:30.360
Thin and small.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.320
Must be agile.

00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:35.179
Where's the knife?

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:36.980
Where's it hanging?

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:37.940
Knife?

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.460
No, I...

00:16:39.899 --> 00:16:40.399
I...

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:41.059
I didn't bring a knife.

00:16:42.159 --> 00:16:42.840
Makes sense.

00:16:43.779 --> 00:16:45.240
Carrying that thing in broad daylight

00:16:45.299 --> 00:16:46.539
would easily reveal your identity.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.799
Can you stop leading the witness?

00:16:49.019 --> 00:16:50.080
What?

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.399
Asking him about a knife...

00:16:52.159 --> 00:16:52.960
Professor Fan.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.519
You still won't admit it?

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:56.460
Director Chang.

00:16:57.299 --> 00:16:59.220
Tell Professor Fan about your plan.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.940
You already know my plan?

00:17:02.679 --> 00:17:04.400
We are just about to go to Uncle Shan's

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.380
to execute the plan.

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:06.579
Let's go.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:07.640
Let's go together.

00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:09.900
We have plenty of time.

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:11.220
Okay.

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:11.759
Then...

00:17:11.759 --> 00:17:12.259
let's go.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:12.779
Let's go.

00:17:26.299 --> 00:17:27.220
Who is it?

00:17:27.299 --> 00:17:28.220
Coming.

00:17:31.359 --> 00:17:32.119
Uncle Shan.

00:17:32.799 --> 00:17:34.460
I'm here with Boss Li and Professor Fan

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:35.279
to see you.

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:37.779
If you want to come, come.

00:17:38.019 --> 00:17:39.279
If you want to sit, sit.

00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:41.299
I can't exactly

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.640
splash water and pave the road with yellow earth

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.700
to welcome you, right?

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.059
Wait a moment, I'll make tea for you.

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:50.759
No need.

00:17:51.579 --> 00:17:52.660
We didn't come for tea.

00:17:53.259 --> 00:17:54.720
Not for tea.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.299
Then what did you come for?

00:17:57.559 --> 00:17:58.779
If it's nothing,

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.299
I'll give you two "mountains" stacked together.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.339
How many of you?

00:18:03.019 --> 00:18:03.700
Please...

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:04.319
Get out.

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:07.839
Don't kick us out, brother.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:09.119
We have business.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:11.900
We brought the thief to you.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.700
Why bring a thief to me?

00:18:15.099 --> 00:18:15.640
Take a look.

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:16.160
Take a look.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.160
What if you like him?

00:18:17.299 --> 00:18:17.660
Me?

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:19.000
I like thieves?

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:19.720
Come.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.099
Take a look.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:24.759
Dad.

00:18:26.359 --> 00:18:27.059
What's going on?

00:18:27.819 --> 00:18:28.519
Dad.

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.299
Don't be so polite.

00:18:33.319 --> 00:18:34.220
He's not a thief.

00:18:34.319 --> 00:18:35.160
It's his son.

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.119
This is your son?

00:18:40.859 --> 00:18:41.799
You are a thief.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:43.880
I am not your father.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:44.880
Thief.

00:18:45.279 --> 00:18:46.900
Don't call him that.

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.259
So he is a thief.

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:50.240
He's not his son.

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:52.680
Your son is a thief?

00:18:53.339 --> 00:18:53.819
Old Li.

00:18:53.819 --> 00:18:54.960
Let me ask.

00:18:55.519 --> 00:18:56.200
Uh...

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.200
Uncle Shan.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.680
Is he really your son?

00:19:03.079 --> 00:19:04.079
He is my son.

00:19:06.339 --> 00:19:07.900
But he is a thief.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:09.640
Yes.

00:19:09.839 --> 00:19:11.480
In our country's folk proverbs,

00:19:11.519 --> 00:19:13.200
there is indeed such a saying.

00:19:13.259 --> 00:19:15.380
It's called: Better a clever rogue than a foolish simpleton.

00:19:15.839 --> 00:19:16.039
And...

00:19:16.039 --> 00:19:17.839
Would you die if you didn't lecture?

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.519
Uncle Shan.

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:21.740
Tell us,

00:19:22.339 --> 00:19:23.559
what exactly is going on?

00:19:27.299 --> 00:19:28.259
This wayward son...

00:19:29.519 --> 00:19:30.819
lost his mom when he was little.

00:19:32.539 --> 00:19:35.059
But he was a sensible child.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.200
Morals, intellect, fitness, arts, and labor—

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.559
he was number one in everything.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:42.819
Who would have thought,

00:19:43.259 --> 00:19:45.740
after college he joined a company,

00:19:47.619 --> 00:19:49.819
and a few years later committed economic crimes.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.940
He went to jail.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.359
Tell me, how could it not be a thief?

00:19:59.319 --> 00:19:59.940
Dad

00:20:01.619 --> 00:20:03.079
The facts of the case are clear

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.539
I've turned over a new leaf

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.160
Give me a break

00:20:09.019 --> 00:20:10.200
If you hadn't gone to jail

00:20:10.759 --> 00:20:12.400
would you have changed for the better?

00:20:14.519 --> 00:20:15.700
You know

00:20:16.119 --> 00:20:17.400
when you went to jail

00:20:18.019 --> 00:20:19.299
your father, I

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.099
almost died

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:25.380
Actually, you

00:20:26.099 --> 00:20:27.319
don't need to be so sorrowful

00:20:27.819 --> 00:20:29.339
I'm not sorrowful

00:20:30.599 --> 00:20:31.779
He went to jail

00:20:32.299 --> 00:20:33.619
and I was home alone

00:20:34.539 --> 00:20:37.359
The gas fumes almost killed me

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.380
If it weren't for my Loyal Dog Hachiko

00:20:42.019 --> 00:20:44.440
smashing the window to call for help

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.380
today

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.420
I wouldn't be here chatting with you all

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:53.160
Dad

00:20:54.359 --> 00:20:55.259
it's all my fault

00:20:55.559 --> 00:20:57.259
What good does blaming you do?

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.759
That's why I always say

00:21:01.359 --> 00:21:02.200
humans

00:21:03.579 --> 00:21:04.759
aren't as good as animals

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:07.240
You know

00:21:08.359 --> 00:21:11.299
you know your dad cares about his reputation

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.960
Ever since you went inside

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:18.140
Among the neighbors

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.059
relatives and friends

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.279
and colleagues in the industry

00:21:23.779 --> 00:21:25.519
I couldn't hold my head up

00:21:26.859 --> 00:21:28.980
Otherwise, would I have sold the house

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.119
and moved into this retirement community?

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:37.359
You're finished for life, kid

00:21:38.859 --> 00:21:40.119
I don't want to see you ever again

00:21:41.519 --> 00:21:42.140
Me and...

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:45.980
I live alone

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:47.960
just fine

00:21:48.619 --> 00:21:49.980
Don't say that, Uncle Shan

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.180
You can't always judge people by the past

00:21:52.519 --> 00:21:53.799
Your son is now

00:21:54.039 --> 00:21:54.819
different

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.200
A leopard never changes its spots

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.180
He'd run off into the sorghum fields

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.200
Yes, Dad

00:22:04.519 --> 00:22:06.079
I've now run into...

00:22:06.619 --> 00:22:08.400
I've turned my life around

00:22:09.339 --> 00:22:11.559
Three years ago, I registered my own company

00:22:11.759 --> 00:22:13.220
Now I'm already one of Huairou's

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.720
Advanced Individual Taxpayers

00:22:19.619 --> 00:22:20.579
You...

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:23.519
You really are Uncle Shan.

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:24.640
I didn't lie to you.

00:22:25.059 --> 00:22:27.220
This is called "A reformed prodigal is worth more than gold".

00:22:27.799 --> 00:22:28.279
Right.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:30.720
Uncle Shan,

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.519
this copy of *The Psychology of Happiness* is for you.

00:22:33.619 --> 00:22:35.859
It was written by my teacher, Mr. Peng Kaiping.

00:22:36.519 --> 00:22:38.420
Happiness must be found within oneself.

00:22:38.519 --> 00:22:39.059
From now on,

00:22:39.059 --> 00:22:39.700
you can't be that

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:40.859
bad-tempered, stubborn old man anymore.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:42.759
Everyone,

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.779
this matter has come to a happy conclusion.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.319
But the thief that got into Willow New Town...

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:48.220
hasn't been caught yet, right?

00:22:49.859 --> 00:22:51.339
Forget about catching any thief.

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.039
The thief...

00:22:53.119 --> 00:22:54.400
I caught him long ago

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.039
and locked him up.

00:22:56.059 --> 00:22:56.500
Caught?

00:22:56.839 --> 00:22:58.079
What's going on?

00:22:58.779 --> 00:22:59.619
Actually,

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.380
this is one I'm raising...

00:23:01.599 --> 00:23:02.880
a Rhesus macaque.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:03.980
That night,

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:05.019
it ran out.

00:23:05.019 --> 00:23:06.559
A Rhesus macaque?

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:07.299
That's right.

00:23:07.299 --> 00:23:07.859
Wait a minute.

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:10.460
I can't even bring a dog into this community,

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:11.900
but he keeps a monkey here for fun?

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:12.380
No,

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:12.740
Shan...

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:13.720
Uncle Shan,

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:14.420
our...

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:16.099
our retirement community doesn't allow pets.

00:23:16.099 --> 00:23:17.619
Let alone a monkey!

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.079
And that's... that's a protected species.

00:23:19.079 --> 00:23:19.519
Yes,

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.359
it's my fault.

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:22.880
This monkey...

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.160
last month, I...

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.099
rescued it from a vendor.

00:23:26.819 --> 00:23:29.059
I know we're not allowed to keep pets here.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.119
So what could I do?

00:23:30.119 --> 00:23:31.920
I secretly took that suitcase,

00:23:32.039 --> 00:23:33.359
put it inside,

00:23:34.319 --> 00:23:35.599
and snuck it in.

00:23:35.819 --> 00:23:36.839
I originally thought,

00:23:37.019 --> 00:23:38.640
once I nursed it back to health,

00:23:38.799 --> 00:23:39.940
and its injuries healed a bit,

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:40.660
I'd send it to

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.440
the Wildlife Rescue Center.

00:23:42.859 --> 00:23:43.799
But unexpectedly,

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.079
it got attached to me

00:23:45.119 --> 00:23:46.180
and wouldn't leave.

00:23:47.019 --> 00:23:48.640
I wondered why my Bell

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.839
kept barking at you.

00:23:50.019 --> 00:23:51.700
Turns out he wasn't barking at you,

00:23:51.819 --> 00:23:53.900
he smelled the monkey in your suitcase.

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:56.019
Exactly.

00:23:56.019 --> 00:23:57.119
And let me tell you,

00:23:57.279 --> 00:23:58.299
that monkey...

00:23:58.819 --> 00:24:00.259
got really spooked.

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:01.559
That night,

00:24:01.619 --> 00:24:02.400
in my room,

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.819
a jar of soybeans this big...

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:05.339
*Crash!* spilled all over the floor.

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:06.660
And because of those soybeans,

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:08.099
didn't I take a huge fall?

00:24:09.119 --> 00:24:10.680
And it ended up causing a scene

00:24:10.859 --> 00:24:11.680
that made our...

00:24:12.079 --> 00:24:12.940
Big Sister Cai...

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:13.400
get...

00:24:13.759 --> 00:24:14.400
get startled.

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:15.059
I'm sorry.

00:24:15.259 --> 00:24:16.839
Who are you calling Big Sister Cai?

00:24:17.079 --> 00:24:18.380
Call me Xiao Cai.

00:24:19.019 --> 00:24:19.740
Xiao Cai.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.539
That day you went for a stroll

00:24:23.539 --> 00:24:25.160
holding a bamboo pole

00:24:25.319 --> 00:24:26.819
and holding up a big apple

00:24:27.079 --> 00:24:28.660
so it was to catch the monkey

00:24:29.019 --> 00:24:29.960
That's right

00:24:30.039 --> 00:24:31.720
it was just to catch this monkey

00:24:32.819 --> 00:24:34.319
Didn't they say the thief

00:24:34.319 --> 00:24:36.200
was carrying a knife?

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.599
Right, it looked like a knife to me

00:24:38.019 --> 00:24:39.380
It wasn't a knife at all

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.700
That was the monkey's big tail

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:44.539
Uncle Shan

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:45.740
hurry up and tell me

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:47.019
where you hid that monkey

00:24:47.019 --> 00:24:48.599
Let's send it to the animal protection center

00:24:48.599 --> 00:24:50.160
and let professionals handle it properly, okay?

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:50.819
Right

00:24:51.099 --> 00:24:52.259
I just put it in my place

00:24:52.259 --> 00:24:53.720
keeping it in the bathroom

00:24:55.079 --> 00:24:55.799
How about this

00:24:56.039 --> 00:24:57.519
let's go over and deal with it now

00:24:57.519 --> 00:24:57.819
Alright

00:24:57.819 --> 00:24:58.380
Right?

00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:58.779
Right

00:24:58.940 --> 00:24:59.880
Take your book

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.220
Got it

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:02.299
Look at this mess

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:04.519
We shouldn't delay

00:25:05.259 --> 00:25:05.759
Everyone

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:07.180
the truth has come to light

00:25:07.539 --> 00:25:08.299
I won

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.460
Old Li, you have to treat me to roast

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:11.460
Where is everyone?

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:13.359
What about the roast duck?

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.259
The cooked duck has flown away
