00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:35.451


00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.120
Put your left hand on your head.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.680
- Like this?
- Mm-hmm.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.930
- Now raise your right hand.
- Like this?

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.820
- Okay.
- Is it alright?

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:48.760
Stay still.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.129
Not sure if you’ll remember

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.010
that small, special moment

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.360
when the whole world
stopped spinning.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.789
Just the two of us.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.970
Don’t move yet.

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:38.830
Hurry up, my leg is going numb.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.289
Don’t rush, give me a second.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.070
What’s this? Why throw it?

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:57.900
Then why suddenly smile?

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.080
I told you to stay still.
Your composition changed.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:11.080
If you want to be a model,
endure it.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.620
Otherwise, I’ll find someone else.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.900
I told you to stay still.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.890
Don’t move.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.050
I’m not moving.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.350
I’m still as can be.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.720
Still, I said. Do you not get it?

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:03.720
Are you teasing me?

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.540
Teasing? No way.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.070
You’re the one not listening.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.860
I said stay still.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.130
No fidgeting, don’t move.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:18.840
Do you not understand?

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.970
Hmm?

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.560
You’re teasing me.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.810
If you don’t want me to move,
stop your hand.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.500
Or if not, you move instead.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.920
Move? What do you mean?

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.070
Hmm?

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.680
You started it.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.150
Take responsibility.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.180
Take responsibility how?

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.180
Don’t leave it hanging.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.910
Finish it.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.260
Like this?

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.659
You...

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.280
Kin.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.180
Is it good?

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.260
Yes.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.030
Thank you.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.310
Do you know why you can’t move?

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:27.360
Kin.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.900
Why did you leave me like that?

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.180
Do you know how I have felt?

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.930
I wanted it to stay that way too.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.340
Hi, Pond. This is Mr. Donlaphat.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.020
- He is a client...
- A very important client

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.810
of Beyond Perfect
House of Perfection.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.740
I have a photo shoot to fix,
I want you to take it.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:45.770
What do you say, Pond?

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.900
Cash only, no checks.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.920
What a coincidence,
our rooms are right across.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.600
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.630
Uncle.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.060
Uncle, wake up.

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:38.290
Uncle.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.240
Uncle.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.550
Go take a shower now.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.480
Hello.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:04.950
- Hello.
- Hi, Nene.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:06.800
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.120
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.590
Mawin.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.790
Are you looking for someone?

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.400
Mawin is here early today.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.820
He’s been here since dawn.
His dad brought him.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.789
- It’s already quite early.
- Yes?

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:40.710
Oh.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.120
By the way,
did Mawin’s dad leave already?

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.570
He dropped him off
and left right away.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:50.030
Yes.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.940
Wake up, wake up!

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:04.400
Why is it so slow?
Why is it so lazy?

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.970
Oh, we are Beyond Perfect!

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.860
We need to have high energy!

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:17.300
- Because we are...
- House of Perfection.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.820
The energy still isn’t here, right?

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.790
Alright, if the energy
isn’t here, then...

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:28.760
Everyone, we need to
get up and paddle!

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:31.960
Paddle, paddle,
still water runs deep.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.390
Paddle, paddle,
still water runs deep.

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:38.780
Paddle and meet the log.
Paddle and meet the log.

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:42.580
- Who worked overnight?
- Get up and paddle!

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.810
Paddle, paddle,
still water runs deep.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.950
Paddle, paddle,
still water runs deep.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.230
Paddle and meet the sulking person.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.670
Who wants to sleep?
Get up and paddle!

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.780
Paddle, paddle,
still water runs deep.

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:01.120
Paddle, paddle,
still water runs deep.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:04.220
Paddle and hit the bridge.
Paddle and hit the bridge.

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.840
Who wants to work?
Get up and paddle! Yay!

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.190
Oh!

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.940
- Energy’s here. Let’s go!
- It’s here. Let’s start work.

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:15.150
Let’s talk about work now.

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:19.360
And let’s also pick the restaurant
for tonight, I’ll treat you all.

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:20.960
Wow, awesome!

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:24.250
Book the same table by the stage.
He'll treat as usual.

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:25.630
- Got it.
- Got it.

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:27.590
Alright, if you're ready,

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:30.920
Just update me on some work stuff.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:31.490
Sure.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.410
Akin, how’s the coffee going?

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:36.410
Still on track. I expect to finish
within this week.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.540
Great, that’s good. And...

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:43.700
Mr. Prasert, the campaign
for the EV cars we’re handling?

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.980
Oh yes, I’ve handled that already.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.220
I showed him our showreel.
He was stunned!

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.610
We’re definitely getting the job.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.600
Excellent, Indy.
But I have one request.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:56.570
For new clients, if there’s something
special, make sure they get it.

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.410
- Got it, I’ll take care of it.
- Okay.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.630
Anyone else need to
update anything?

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:01.750
- No, all good.
- All good.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:03.940
- Oh, wait. AJ.
- Yes?

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.500
When does the internship end?

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.720
According to the schedule,
five more months.

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.700
I want to who which month?

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.320
End of March.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.900
End of March? Hmm...

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:16.530
And after that,
do you want to work here?

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:18.350
It depends on your kindness.

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:20.060
I’m just kind of perfect.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:24.840
Well, we’ll talk about it later.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.260
Anyway, thank yo.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.100
I understand that
you're dedicated to our company.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.990
So, I have something special
to give you.

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:39.240
Is it a bonus?

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.710
Better than that! I want you to
take care of your health.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:45.880
Because people like us
get high pay,

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:49.390
but we work hard and party hard,

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:53.000
and get little rest.
That’s not perfect.

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:57.820
I’ve decided to set a KPI for whom
taking good care of their health.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.600
And there’ll be a special bonus
every 3 months.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.310
How will you evaluate?

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:06.460
By attendance or sick leave or...

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.850
Oh, I’m not that harsh, Akin.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.620
Our building just opened
a fitness center.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:16.710
And I want everyone to work out.

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:19.110
You can go before or after work.

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:21.310
You can work out there.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:26.230
The trainer will send me
monthly evaluations.

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:30.450
And anyone who meets
the criteria will get a bonus.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:31.150
That’s it.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.100
Okay, that’s still good.
Better than nothing.

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:38.590
Yeah, and if anyone has
questions about the evaluation...

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.960
This person will answer
all our questions.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:42.950
Who?

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:01.660
The release cue is perfect!

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.820
This is Nut.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.920
The owner of the gym
in our building.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.770
He will explain everything.
Please welcome!

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:16.950
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.860
Hello, I’m Nut.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.170
Glad to take care of you
and make you perfect.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:23.570
Perfect!

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.360
Perfect, of course, perfect.

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.590
- Like this, coach?
- Yes, that’s right.

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:40.050
Where should I tense up?

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:41.460
- The stomach.
- Stomach, yes.

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.460
- Keep it tense.
- One.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.300
- Can you do it?
- I can.

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:47.490
Two.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:51.510
- Whoa, AJ.
- Yes?

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.110
- This isn’t how you do it.
- Oh.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.440
AJ, you need to face forward first.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:57.850
Now, hold here.

00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:59.190
Or you can hold here.

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:01.430
Then slowly push up.

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:03.710
Breathe out while pushing.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:07.680
And when you lower it, breathe in.

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:11.650
Breathe in. That’s it.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:13.590
Nine.

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:15.630
Got it. Here we go.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:20.360
I’m about to puke! Ten.
Done, coach.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.010
Can I take a break? A whole hour?

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:25.740
An hour? One minute?

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.820
Three, four.
Feel your shoulders more.

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:33.130
Slowly lower, breathe in,
breathe out, push.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.090
You okay?

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.530
- Anything I can help with?
- Nut?

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.500
Whoa, hey!

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:44.620
You could barely sit earlier!

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.530
- Alright, ten reps!
- Huh?

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:48.780
Hah, let’s try!

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:53.280
One, two, three...

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.850
Whoa, fit like this,
you’ll have a six-pack in no time!

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.990
- See how fast I run?
- Yes.

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:00.390
Are you too slow?

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.080
Here, here, I’ll show you.
It’s like this, Fai.

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.970
Go faster.
Run as I push. Fai!

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:10.490
Run faster, Fai!
Faster, run, faster!

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.280
Faster, Fai, faster!

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.830
Don’t play like that,
it could be dangerous.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:19.390
Sorry, I was just playing around.

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:24.290
And, if we want more speed,
we press on the right.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.830
But if you need an incline,
press on the left.

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:34.940
- Oh, what are you doing?
- Yes?

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:38.670
Showing off your body or something?

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:43.590
The first one,
I totally win this, don’t I?

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:44.920
Right?

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:16.170
Come here, come on!

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:17.270
Why do you bring me here?

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.000
You need to exercise too,
to stay strong!

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.820
I’m strong already.

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:25.210
I just see you studying,
always sitting at the desk.

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:28.900
Come stretch a bit,
or you might get sick later.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:30.910
Which machine should I use?

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.490
I’ll show you first.
The first move.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.410
Pull it out,
then take a step forward.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.740
Push your body to a 45-degree angle,
arms perpendicular, then push it out.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.080
Breathe out when you push.

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:47.370
Alright, try it out.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.510
Step your leg.

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:55.980
Is this really safe?

00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:01.040
I’m a sports science kid,
trust me. Come on.

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.280
Alright, step your leg first.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.180
Step out one step. That’s right.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.849
One step is enough, step out.

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:13.630
Breathe out.

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:16.470
- Is it correct?
- Yes, and then breathe in.

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:18.010
Tighten your stomach too.

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:21.220
That’s it! Great.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:25.660
Okay.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.420
You okay?

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.700
Can we do cardio in
the room after this?

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:42.610
Let’s take a break,
then do another set.

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:43.850
Another set?

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:11.030
Are you following me everywhere?
Is this too much?

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:16.890
Who said I’m following you?
This is my turf.

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:24.130
I’m a co-owner of
the gym here with Nut.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:28.030
It’s who came to my place today.

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:30.340
You missed me, didn’t you?

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:42.310
You’re staring at me like that,
I’m blushing now.

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:44.310
It’s been a while
since you stared at me.

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:48.490
Do you think
I’m the same as before?

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.510
- I think I’m more toned.
- Stuck on the past, huh?

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.070
Why are you blushing?

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:20.500
You’ve done more before,
haven’t you?

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.420
More?

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:33.570
What do you mean by “more”?

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:35.710
Well...

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:39.480
I don’t really remember.

00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:57.830
Hey!

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.610
You’ve done more before,
haven’t you?

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:19.330
Why are you waiting here?

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:21.570
You're going to catch a cold.

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:23.590
Have all our fans left already?

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:28.730
What fans? They're just friends,
cheering for me.

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.780
- So you forgot about me?
- I didn’t forget.

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:34.590
Accepting gifts and taking pictures.
That’s why I was late.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:37.990
Some are in the clubroom already.
I can pick it up later.

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:39.550
You’ve been waiting for a while?

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:41.530
Can I say sorry?

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:43.140
What if you can’t?

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:48.320
Come on, I’m sorry!
I won’t be late next time.

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:52.430
Here, I brought you a gold medal.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.550
I didn’t want a medal.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.740
But I wanted to give it to you.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:02.500
Every shot I made,
I thought of you, I swear.

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:05.060
So, you want to shoot in my face?

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:07.960
- Huh?
- No, no!

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.370
It’s just that seeing
your face gives me strength.

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:15.370
I was just teasing you.
Seeing you gives me motivation.

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:20.030
Now, I got this gold medal.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.410
Don’t you think
I deserve a prize too?

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:27.330
Your fans already gave you a lot.
What else do you want?

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:32.790
But I want it from you.
Please give me a reward.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.240
- Please?
- What do you want?

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:41.590
Hmm... I want a kiss.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.410
One more, just a little more.

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:47.900
That's enough.

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.800
Thank you for cheering me on.

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:57.340
I want you to come cheer for me
every time I compete.

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.330
Hmm.

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:04.360
Hmm? Answer me.

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.100
I saie "hmm."

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:11.720
What does it mean?
Answer properly.

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:14.320
Yes.

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:16.780
What?

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:20.080
Yes.

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:42.520
I love you. Do you love me?

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:43.730
I do.

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:45.450
Do you love me a lot?

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:53.410
Again. Answer properly.
Do you love me a lot?

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:56.340
Yes.

00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:03.140
I love you so much that I don’t
think I can love anyone else.

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:07.470
- Really?
- Hmm.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.320
"Hmm" again?

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:12.580
You know, right?

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:15.950
What’s going to happen?

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.560
I’m heading out now.

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.040
See you, bro.

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:37.300
- See you.
- Bye.

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:51.420
Thanks, bro.

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:56.790
You're in a surprisingly
good mood today.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.000
Lately, it's been nothing
but good things.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.220
What kind of things?

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:09.060
Oh, first love is hard to forget.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.470
How do you know that?

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.240
It just feels familiar.

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:16.750
But you've never met
Kin before, right?

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:20.660
You’ve shown me pictures.
Almost all the pictures you have.

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:26.100
The way you act when you see him,
I'm sure, this is the one.

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:35.300
4th-year student in
communication arts

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:38.610
left a 1st-year
science sports student

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.650
without a care or any reason.

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:46.510
Are you reminding yourself
or trying to rub it in my face?

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:51.840
You know how much it hurt.
This time, it might hurt even more.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:55.000
Is this supposed to
be encouragement?

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:01.840
What do you think I should do?

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:06.950
Now that we've met again,
it can't end like before.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.860
I won’t let him slip away again.

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.290
Alright, let's go with that.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.820
But if you mess up and
he doesn’t want you back...

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:24.130
I’ll wait for my turn.

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.180
Bro.

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:29.390
I’m serious.

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:33.110
Being brothers is better anyway.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:38.100
What? Water drops on a rock every day,
does the rock never erode?

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:47.690
Where there’s effort,
there’s effort.

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:07.130
- Here you go, Akin.
- Thank you, Fai.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:09.930
Thank you.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.900
Everyone, Mr. Don has arrived.

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:18.830
Oh, great! So cool.

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.820
- Because we are Beyond...
- Perfect.

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.080
House of Perfection.

00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:33.990
Same floor.

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:39.680
Oh, you’re the important client.

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:43.470
Don, my name’s Donlaphat.

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:47.520
Sorry for not introducing myself,
Mr. Photographer.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:52.980
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Important Client.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.090
How was the juice shoot
the other day?

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:03.570
I approved it yesterday.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:09.320
I hope our future collaborations

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.360
will go smoothly.

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:23.390
Did you spill perfume
this morning?

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.840
The scent was so overpowering.

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:32.380
We’re not close enough for you
to comment on my personal stuff.

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.720
I’m just trying to help.

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:37.540
Also, that kind of scent is usually
worn by old men, or sugar daddies.

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:41.140
Trust me, throw it out
when you get home.

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:47.180
Thanks for the detailed critique.

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:49.510
Detailed?

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:55.130
Your critique was so thorough,
down to the tiniest details.

00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:59.460
You're welcome.
Appreciate it very much.

00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:03.310
But I think…

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:06.770
- We’re not close enough for…
- Come on.

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:10.860
Don’t drag it out, just accept
differences of opinion.

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:12.590
Learn to lose.

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:19.690
Everything’s ready?
don’t make mistakes.

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:24.330
- Wow! Oh my.
- Hello, your outfit looks great.

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:29.370
- Hello, Mr. Don.
- Hello.

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:32.870
Please, follow me to
the meeting room.

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:42.880
- Please sit.
- Okay.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:02.720
Not opening the file?
Want me to stare at a blank screen?

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:08.480
Oh, sorry. One moment please.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:11.400
Is it the file you
sent to me yesterday?

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:14.240
I can open it from
my computer instead.

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:16.120
Thanks.

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:22.630
Here it is. Shall we start?

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.860
This is the client’s first
project with us.

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.620
And I want to impress him.

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:31.690
The product is ice cream,
and he has high expectations.

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:34.530
I’ve reviewed
the marketing team’s research.

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:40.470
I can say this product
will shake up the market.

00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:41.690
Yes.

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:48.010
Pass on the details and timeline

00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:52.610
along with the client’s information
to Beyond Perfect.

00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:58.870
Please take care of it.

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:00.020
Gladly.

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:03.010
For the photographer,
we’ll use Pond as usual.

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:06.820
If he’s available, I don’t mind.

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:10.640
If the client likes my work,

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:13.870
I don’t mind either.

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:17.390
Great.

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:23.310
You can trust us.
The results will be high quality.

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:26.070
- Because we are Beyond...
- Perfect.

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:29.330
House of Perfection.

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.470
- Okay, let’s continue.
- Signature pose.

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:36.550
Let’s continue.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:41.490
Tonight there’s a small party to
celebrate the completed project.

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:44.690
You should join us.
Almost everyone’s going.

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:46.600
And today is also Singles’ Day.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.020
But we have
a meeting tomorrow morning.

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.460
Oh, that’s fine, Not late.

00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:53.960
Just a little sip.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:57.090
Pond, come with us.
We’re all here anyway.

00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:59.560
But I wasn’t involved
in the previous project.

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:04.060
Oh, it’s fine. Come along,
let’s celebrate Singles’ Day.

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.800
11.11, you know.

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:11.850
Good, I have no client
appointments tonight, right?

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:12.850
None.

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:16.740
Okay, then I’ll go.

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:18.590
Great.

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:21.120
Good.

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.150
Sounds fun.

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:26.380
Then I’ll join you.

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:32.090
Great. Fai, send the location
to Pond and Mr. Don too.

00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:35.140
Okay. Are you coming with us?

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:39.440
Uh, I’ll pass.

00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:41.600
I need to take care of some work.

00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:44.710
I also have some work to clear.
Excuse me.

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:47.600
Oh, no, Akin, come with us.

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.380
Just a quick drink,
then you can get back to work.

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.090
Today Mawin’s going to
his mom’s home.

00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:57.250
Alright, but not too late, okay?

00:33:58.050 --> 00:33:58.710
Okay.

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:02.610
- Okay.
- Let’s go together.

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:14.159
Singles’ Day 11.11 is
working well, huh?

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.000
Looks like there are
a lot of singles around here.

00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:21.880
At least there are two of us here.

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.380
I’m not single.

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:32.130
Just that my relationship
status isn’t clear yet.

00:34:32.199 --> 00:34:33.400
Mmmm.

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:37.370
How about we invite
our trainer to chill tonight?

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:41.530
Sure, there’s a new place
opening around here. Let’s go!

00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:43.590
Alright.

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:53.980
Please go inside.
This place is our regular spot.

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:56.270
It’s our regular spot.

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:57.740
Where’s AJ?

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:01.710
After finishing or getting a new one,
We always come here.

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:04.650
Let’s go quickly!

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:15.940
Okay, everyone, enjoy tonight!
The host is ready to pay.

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:17.680
Awesome.

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:20.190
Wait, are we all ordering
the same thing?

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.710
Yeah, go for it, little brother.

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:22.970
Hey, guys.

00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:26.090
- Big order, alright?
- Okay.

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:27.840
- Order food too, okay?
- Guys!

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:28.930
- Fai.
- Yes?

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:30.250
- Take care of Mr. Don.
- Of course.

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:31.940
- Pond, go all out.
- Okay.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:32.780
Yes, brother.

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:34.580
What would you like to drink?

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:38.790
- I’ll have wine, please.
- Let me check on that for you.

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:42.820
- Sorry, do you have any wine?
- No, sorry.

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:44.360
It’s okay, thank you.

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:48.210
Sorry, they don’t have wine
at the moment.

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:51.060
Would you like me to send
someone to buy it outside?

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:55.100
No, it’s fine.
I’ll have it on the rocks instead.

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:56.140
On the rocks, please.

00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:58.850
Sorry, do you have round ice cubes?

00:35:58.970 --> 00:35:59.840
No, sorry.

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:04.160
Should we change the place?
You might break out in a rash.

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:07.940
This place is not very high-end,
no wine, no round ice cubes.

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:11.620
It's fine, I'm relaxed about it.

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:16.110
- Thank you for caring.
- I wasn't really caring.

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:20.270
It just seems like
you are in the wrong place.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.280
- Oh, here we go!
- Here it comes!

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:27.130
Give Mr. Don first.

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:29.500
- Give him first.
- Here you go.

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.640
- Please go ahead.
- Go ahead.

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:34.550
Here we are!

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:38.960
For the Singapore project
that just finished,

00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:43.720
congratulations on
the new project from Mr. Don.

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:45.410
- Eh?
- What?

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:50.240
- And for the Singles’ Day.
- What does it have to do with this?

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:54.810
Single?

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:04.430
Refreshing after a long day's work.

00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:23.920
Excuse me, I need to
step out for a minute.

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:27.770
- Step out?
- Step out for what?

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:29.720
He needs to pee.

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:33.430
- Go, go!
- Alright, I’ll head out too.

00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:35.460
Oh, Kin.

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:38.210
- Don't leave yet.
- Don’t be drunk. We have a meeting.

00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:40.370
- What the hell?
- Kin.

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.960
- Goodbye. Mr. Dol, goodbye.
- Are you serious?

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:43.270
- I’m leaving now.
- Kin.

00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:46.470
- Are you serious?
- I’m leaving now. Goodbye!

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:47.900
Go home safely.

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:51.720
Going home early, huh?

00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:56.290
Tomorrow’s Saturday.
What meeting are we having?

00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:59.510
If it's not convenient,
we can postpone.

00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:03.980
It’s fine.
Everything is the same as usual.

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:06.940
Work hard, play harder.

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:10.200
And if they are not ready
for the meeting,

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:12.300
it will affect their evaluation.

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:14.720
Me?

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.180
Oh, I’m safe.

00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:23.790
- Let’s go!
- Cheers!

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:26.530
Mr. Don, would you like
anything else?

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.360
It’s fine,
I’ll just go to the restroom.

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:31.970
- Do you want my help?
- No, it’s fine.

00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:33.930
No need. Trust me.

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:36.950
- No need to.
- No need to. He can walk.

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:39.900
The customer’s going
to the restroom.

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:58.260
Are you drunk, our important guest?

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:02.100
Excuse me.

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:08.050
Excuse me...

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:10.990
Is this enough?

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:13.820
Move.

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:19.500
I moved. Just a bit.

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:22.380
Here you go.

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:31.100
Sorry.

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:35.750
Give me a kiss.

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:12.220
Are we continuing?

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:50.640
Harder.

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:04.280
So, where’s Pond?
He's already found a girl for sure.

00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:06.720
One single gone already tonight.

00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:08.540
Yeah, he’s off the market.

00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:11.380
Wait, where did Mr. Don go?

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:14.730
I think he probably
go home already.

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.160
Gone with the wind.

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:19.800
He’s scared of getting too drunk
and ruining his image.

00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:24.010
Let him be. Our client’s grown-up,
let him take care of himself.

00:42:24.090 --> 00:42:27.940
Hey, how can you just let him go?
He's the client!

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:31.060
- Fine, boss.
- Where is he now?

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:34.520
- Mr. Don, right?
- Where’s the glass?

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:38.130
- Let’s go.
- One more..

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:39.230
AJ, cheers!

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:19.980
- Cheers, bottoms up!
- Bottoms up!

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:27.450
For Singles’ Day,

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:31.100
I’m single. Are you single too?

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:33.640
I’m not. My boyfriend’s possessive.
He’s coming to pick me up.

00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:38.480
Hey, don’t ask about this one.

00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:40.720
Single but won’t admit it.

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:46.580
Hey, that’s called
“single with hope.”

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.530
Come on, another glass.

00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:53.340
- Coming right up.
- Let’s go.

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:56.420
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:43:57.930 --> 00:44:00.470
- Bottoms up!
- Bottoms up!

00:44:00.490 --> 00:44:01.810
- Here we go!
- Let’s go!

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:10.990
Here you go, fill it up.

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:14.350
- Hey, enough. Let’s go home.
- Another one?

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:17.210
The gym’s open as usual tomorrow.

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:20.540
That’s enough. Let’s go.

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:22.810
Waiter, check please.

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:24.060
Sure thing.

00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:28.150
Hey, you okay?

00:44:30.690 --> 00:44:32.000
I’m fine, no problem.

00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:33.580
Are you sure?

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:37.920
Hey, I think you’re not okay.
Let me take you home.

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:40.990
Hey, I’m fine, really.

00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:43.730
Are you afraid he won’t make it
to your room?

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:48.980
No, no, don’t say that.
This is my older brother.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:51.710
My good older brother.

00:44:55.090 --> 00:44:58.600
Same status. Never leveled up.

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.860
Let’s go.

00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:06.110
People live with hope, Nat.

00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:12.800
I’m off.

00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:13.900
Hey, hey.

00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:30.560
A little move, boss.

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:42.520
Boss, boss.

00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:00.050
Why isn’t it opening?

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:12.400
Hey, it’s not opening.

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:18.080
Hey!

00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:24.730
Hey, hey!

00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:38.140
Wrong room.
This isn't your room.

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:40.260
Water.

00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:43.140
Don’t start with that joke.

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:44.630
Water, please.

00:46:57.210 --> 00:46:58.210
Here, water.

00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:13.420
Hey, you can’t throw up here.
Go to the bathroom.

00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:17.830
Hey, wait.

00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:16.960
I miss you.

00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:20.950
I’ve missed you all along.

00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:24.720
When you get your senses back,
go back to your room.

00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:30.060
No.

00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:33.930
I want to stay like this forever.

00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:36.860
Stay in your arms like we used to.

00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:42.050
Hug for a long time,
I don’t want to let go.

00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:48.070
Than... Than.

00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:25.510
You little thing.

00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:29.730
Who says I’m little?
I’m not little.

00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:31.380
I’m not sleeping.

00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:37.040
What’s this?

00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:41.150
I’m so tired.
Do you think I’ll pass the exam?

00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:45.410
Just give it your best shot.
That’s all.

00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:49.060
Soon, you won’t be able to hang out
with high school kid anymore.

00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:52.930
You’ll be a senior,
and I’ll be freshmen.

00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:54.680
Pass it first.

00:49:56.510 --> 00:50:00.940
Gget up and drink some milk first.
Then you can study more, or sleep.

00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:03.990
Let me rest my eyes for 5 minutes.

00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:06.470
But don’t leave, stay here.

00:50:06.490 --> 00:50:09.110
I’ll fall asleep.
Wake me up in 5 minutes.

00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:10.380
Hmm.

00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:14.040
Hmm again. That’s not cute at all.

00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:17.070
You should say, “Yes, darling.”

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:19.350
Yes, darling.

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:22.610
Go ahead, close your eyes.
I’ll wake you up in 5 minutes.

00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:12.600
Is this how it feels
to never change?

00:51:29.710 --> 00:51:30.620
Let’s shower together.

00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:35.420
I haven’t cleared things up yet.
Let’s find a chance to talk about it.

00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:38.110
I think I’ve found a new kid
who’s perfect for this product.

00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:38.940
Who is it?

00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:41.940
Deal a kid named Nene
be the model for it.

00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:44.680
Than said, if you want something,
you should talk to him directly.

00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:47.390
I'm not sure, though.
When I’m drunk,

00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:49.930
I might spill everything about
last night to anyone.

00:51:50.310 --> 00:51:51.220
Is this blackmail?

00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:55.240
Tell me when you stopped loving me
and started loving someone else?

00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:58.720
Help me understand everything.
Right now, I’m completely confused.
