WEBVTT

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:02.019
That's enough.

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.159
You can drop me off here.

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:04.760
Dad, originally tonight...

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.219
...I was going to have dinner with you.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.920
But my company announced a team building event last minute.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.840
It's fine.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.379
The food here is great.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.759
If I don't eat it for three days, I miss it terribly.

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:13.659
Really.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.659
You should hurry back.

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:15.240
No.

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:16.300
I'll walk you inside.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.439
This bag is pretty heavy.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.139
Bag?

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:19.520
Just this bag?

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:21.039
You call this bag heavy?

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.340
You think your dad can't carry it?

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:24.580
No, I'm just afraid of tiring you out.

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:27.000
Don't you know your dad's physique?

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.840
Back in the day, I had iron shoulders and fleet feet.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.500
I even carried water for widows.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.360
I went up to the mountains and down to the countryside.

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.400
Did field marches, threw grenades, and fired guns.

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:38.159
You...

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:41.139
No, why are you hitting yourself so hard?

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:42.699
You're going to make yourself throw up.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.819
Just wanted to show off in front of you.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.580
But your dad really does have strong hands.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.979
Let me tell you, with my grip strength...

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:49.300
...if I gave someone a slap, hey...

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:51.520
...even I couldn't handle it.

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:53.520
Alright, you...

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:54.939
...you are very amazing.

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:56.479
You're the best, okay?

00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:57.680
Alright.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.800
Come on, give it to me.

00:02:59.379 --> 00:02:59.960
Go on now.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.199
Then I'll come pick you up on Saturday.

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.800
Saturday?

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:03.699
No need.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.300
It's hard enough to get a weekend off.

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:08.120
Shouldn't you go with your girlfriends...

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:09.680
...shopping, dining...

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.379
...and to karaoke?

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:12.520
Why always worry about picking me up?

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.500
That works too.

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.939
Friday.

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:17.280
Okay, off you go.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.680
If you don't go, you'll be late for the team building.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.340
I'm going, Dad.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.439
Okay, bye-bye.

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:23.319
My daughter insists on picking me up early.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.259
Who insists on picking you up early?

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:26.080
Old Liang.

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:28.680
I was just talking about my daughter.

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:31.479
Such an overly enthusiastic little padded jacket.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.419
She smothers me until I'm breaking out in a cold sweat.

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:34.780
Trying to annoy me, aren't you?

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.099
Pulling a Humblebrag on me here.

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:38.099
You were the one showing off first today.

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.259
Talking to me with your nose in the air the whole time.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.159
What's wrong with you?

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:42.919
Did you get a nosebleed?

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.360
Who got a nosebleed?

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.280
I'm wearing the...

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.620
...designer sunglasses my daughter just bought me from abroad.

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:50.479
The sun has gone down.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.680
And you're still wearing sunglasses.

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:53.120
Careful you don't fall into the lake in a bit.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:55.599
Boss Li is back.

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:00.419
What's the meaning of this?

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:01.699
Please wait a moment.

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:03.180
Don't you know who I am?

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:05.580
Liang Shengtian.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.259
The famous movie star...

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.919
...'s father.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.800
Doesn't matter if I know you.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.319
The retirement community won't let your dog in.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:14.979
Who are you calling a dog?

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:17.339
This weekend...

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.360
Ms. Liu, you...

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.720
Didn't go back home for a visit?

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.180
No.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.319
I'm carefree without a home.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.000
Even if I go home, I'm all alone.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.540
Then...

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.180
Might as well stay here where it's lively.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.439
Exactly.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.620
I don't like going home either.

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:31.759
When I go home and see that little fox in our house...

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:33.000
I get so angry, let me tell you.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.800
Me too.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:34.819
You have a little fox at home?

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.720
What little fox? I meant...

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.199
I'm also alone at home.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:39.860
Usually...

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:40.959
well...

00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:42.339
when I'm busy, I don't feel it.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.860
Working, giving lectures...

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:45.500
But...

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.040
once the holidays arrive...

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.160
inside my heart...

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.420
Actually, me too.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.300
Me too.

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:53.560
Usually, when things get busy, it's not obvious.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.040
What work?

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.420
Teaching.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.500
Right, I don't have any teaching.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.939
Of course.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.800
But I'm super busy playing matchmaker.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:59.800
I haven't been idle.

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:01.800
To tell you the truth...

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.100
back when I first retired...

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.660
my heart felt so empty.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.300
I had nothing to do but...

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.120
talk to myself...

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.319
and chat away.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.519
My colleagues all said...

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.639
I couldn't go on like this.

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:11.439
Yes, they advised me...

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:12.680
to get a pet or something.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.259
So what should I get?

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:16.660
Raise anything but a son.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:17.879
They grow up to be ingrates.

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:18.680
I raised a...

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.160
Ingrate.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.779
Ingrate.

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:22.639
What ingrate did I raise, tell me?

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:23.360
I say, Xiao Cai...

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.060
can you stop interrupting here?

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:26.180
I didn't interrupt.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.639
Aren't the three of us chatting nicely?

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.980
The Professor is talking about raising pets.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.379
You are talking about raising sons.

00:05:31.459 --> 00:05:32.120
That's a mix-up.

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:36.120
Actually, if you ask me,

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.939
why keep pets?

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.980
We can barely take care of people, honestly.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.860
By the way,

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:42.560
speaking of pets reminds me.

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:44.439
Next door at Longevity Residence,

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:46.019
an old man named Shan moved in.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.660
He's always muttering to himself.

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:48.579
Saying things like,

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:50.199
"Humans..."

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.379
"These humans..."

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:52.879
"Don't always deal with humans."

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:54.379
"It's better to deal with animals."

00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:55.980
"Animals are always animals,"

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.180
"but humans aren't always human."

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:01.180
Why does this old guy talk like that?

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:03.480
Isn't that painting everyone with the same brush?

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.120
Thank you.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:05.839
This old man,

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.420
must have been traumatized.

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:09.600
What did you say his name was?

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:10.779
Shan.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.800
His surname is Shan.

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:13.199
I saw it on his doorplate.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:15.740
Let me educate you.

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:17.160
The character for "single",

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.459
when used as a surname,

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:19.220
is pronounced "Shan".

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.000
This "Shan" has...

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.860
three origins.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.860
First, it comes from King Cheng of Zhou...

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.459
Professor, you're going too far back.

00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:30.180
Just tell Xiao Cai,

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:31.839
that old man's surname is Shan.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.540
His surname is Shan, right.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.139
He isn't kind at all, he's fierce.

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:38.120
He looks like he's got a chip on his shoulder.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.500
Ignoring everyone.

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:42.519
I think the name Shan suits him best.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.560
Let him go be a loner.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.939
Why won't you let me in?

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:48.439
I live right here.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:49.560
I paid in full.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.399
Do you know that or not?

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:51.360
We know.

00:06:51.579 --> 00:06:53.319
Don't you live in Evergreen Residence?

00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:55.000
If you know, why won't you let me in?

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.019
It's about your dog...

00:06:57.139 --> 00:06:57.920
Are you cursing me?

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:58.620
Cursing again?

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.220
No.

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:00.819
He said "this dog of yours."

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:01.660
You're still cursing!

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:04.060
You're answering too fast.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.779
Let us finish our sentence.

00:07:06.019 --> 00:07:07.800
He said the dog you're holding...

00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:08.620
...is not allowed in.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.699
My dog has a license.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:11.639
It has a leash.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.800
Why can't it come in?

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:13.899
Uncle Liang.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.120
Our retirement community just issued a new rule today.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.439
No pets allowed anymore.

00:07:17.519 --> 00:07:18.740
The director told us.

00:07:18.899 --> 00:07:19.500
First.

00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:20.680
Fear of scaring people.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.819
Second, fear of hurting people.

00:07:21.819 --> 00:07:22.959
Third, fear of infecting people.

00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:23.379
Fourth.

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:25.300
Fourth, you're too dogmatic, you know that?

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.519
I'm holding my dog on a tight leash.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.959
How could it possibly hurt anyone?

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:30.480
It's even less likely to scare anyone.

00:07:31.079 --> 00:07:31.860
Besides.

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:34.300
My dog is very smart.

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:35.839
It can guard the house.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.199
How does it guard?

00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:40.100
If a thief enters our community...

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.300
It can immediately...

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.680
Immediately pounce and bite.

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:43.540
You see?

00:07:43.579 --> 00:07:45.180
It could still hurt someone, right?

00:07:45.259 --> 00:07:46.879
Who said it bites?

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.540
It can immediately bark.

00:07:48.819 --> 00:07:49.980
Barking isn't okay either.

00:07:50.079 --> 00:07:51.660
Barking can hurt people too.

00:07:51.779 --> 00:07:52.300
The day before yesterday.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.019
Well...

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.540
An old lady at Pine and Crane Residence.

00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:56.519
Her leg got broken by a dog's bark.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.180
Impossible.

00:07:58.379 --> 00:07:59.620
Absolutely impossible.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.199
A dog bark broke a person's leg?

00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:04.319
That little dog barked...

00:08:05.079 --> 00:08:06.000
Her legs went weak...

00:08:06.379 --> 00:08:07.300
Her body tilted...

00:08:07.399 --> 00:08:08.279
She fell to the ground...

00:08:08.339 --> 00:08:09.500
And broke her femoral head.

00:08:09.699 --> 00:08:11.699
That's how the leg got broken by the bark.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:12.779
This...

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.639
But it wasn't my dog that barked and broke it.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.819
My dog only barks when it sees bad people.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.480
It doesn't bark if it doesn't see bad people.

00:08:23.899 --> 00:08:24.600
Mr. Liang,

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.720
didn't you say your dog

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.019
only barks when it sees bad people?

00:08:27.019 --> 00:08:28.839
Maybe this is a bad person.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.000
No, sorry.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:30.779
I didn't mean you.

00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:31.720
I meant...

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.679
Stop barking, Bell.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:33.480
Stop it.

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:34.320
Mr. Liang,

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.240
you'd better leave with Bell.

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:36.820
Exactly.

00:08:36.879 --> 00:08:38.659
Only old people come in and out of here.

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:39.860
If he scares someone into breaking a leg,

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.080
we can't take responsibility.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:41.779
Mr. Liang,

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.100
if you don't leave now,

00:08:43.139 --> 00:08:44.120
we will have to take

00:08:44.419 --> 00:08:44.960
your Bell

00:08:45.019 --> 00:08:46.000
into custody.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.919
You wouldn't dare!

00:08:48.539 --> 00:08:49.519
He's barking at me!

00:08:49.659 --> 00:08:50.519
I like it!

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:51.519
Is it any of your business?

00:08:52.279 --> 00:08:53.919
What are you fussing about here?

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.240
Step aside.

00:08:55.379 --> 00:08:56.340
Mr. Shan,

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.820
aren't I helping you?

00:08:58.919 --> 00:09:00.340
Do I need your help?

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:03.820
Come.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:05.740
Your name is Bell?

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.600
So beautiful.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:08.299
Good boy.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.399
How old are you?

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.440
My dog is acting so strange.

00:09:11.539 --> 00:09:12.019
He...

00:09:12.179 --> 00:09:13.480
usually doesn't bark.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.220
You don't look like a bad person either.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.740
You're the bad person!

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.440
What a good dog.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.639
He treats you as his master.

00:09:24.679 --> 00:09:26.759
Barking at people is his way of protecting you.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.779
That's called gratitude.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:31.559
People like you...

00:09:32.879 --> 00:09:34.200
aren't as good as this dog.

00:09:34.779 --> 00:09:35.240
You...

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:35.720
why do you...

00:09:35.759 --> 00:09:37.100
snap at everyone you see?

00:09:37.759 --> 00:09:39.259
I think you're worse than this dog.

00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:40.320
Let's go.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.019
Bell, let's go.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:54.519
No need, no need.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:56.379
I...

00:09:56.379 --> 00:09:57.960
I'm leaving now.

00:09:58.639 --> 00:09:59.500
You two, get up.

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:00.539
No need.

00:10:00.919 --> 00:10:01.480
No need.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.100
My back, watch my back.

00:10:03.879 --> 00:10:04.600
No need, no need.

00:10:05.039 --> 00:10:05.480
Get up.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:13.980
You're back.

00:10:14.679 --> 00:10:16.759
I thought you were coming back tomorrow.

00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:19.919
My daughter has meetings today and tomorrow.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.039
She's busy.

00:10:21.899 --> 00:10:22.820
She was dead set on

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.179
keeping me for dinner.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.379
But then I thought,

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.840
I shouldn't affect her work, right?

00:10:29.039 --> 00:10:29.840
So I came back.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.240
Well, you're back now.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:32.740
You haven't eaten yet?

00:10:32.779 --> 00:10:33.759
Cooking noodles for yourself?

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:36.259
Once I went back this weekend,

00:10:36.519 --> 00:10:37.659
my old comrades heard about it.

00:10:37.659 --> 00:10:38.860
They lined up to treat me.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.519
Eating every day, drinking every meal.

00:10:40.559 --> 00:10:41.860
A hell of booze and meat.

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.200
I couldn't turn them down.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.960
Brag on. Humblebragging again, huh?

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:45.820
It's annoying.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.240
I just wanted to make some porridge or noodles,

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.059
to rest my stomach.

00:10:51.299 --> 00:10:52.340
This weekend,

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:53.980
another elderly man moved in next door.

00:10:54.019 --> 00:10:54.639
His surname is Shan.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:55.580
You didn't know, right?

00:10:55.679 --> 00:10:56.580
What's new about that?

00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.240
I heard from Xiao Cai

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.720
that this old man might have psychological issues.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:02.820
What kind of issues?

00:11:03.379 --> 00:11:04.039
Well,

00:11:04.139 --> 00:11:05.620
he treats dogs like people,

00:11:05.679 --> 00:11:07.179
and treats people like dogs.

00:11:08.559 --> 00:11:09.559
A total oddball.

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:11.559
What's going on?

00:11:15.159 --> 00:11:15.879
What's that sound?

00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:17.419
I think I saw a dark shadow.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.159
It whooshed past the window.

00:11:20.759 --> 00:11:22.179
Is someone peeping at us?

00:11:22.299 --> 00:11:23.379
Impossible.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.519
Peeping at two old men?

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.000
That would be way too perverted.

00:11:26.279 --> 00:11:28.240
I think you're seeing things out of hunger.

00:11:28.519 --> 00:11:30.000
The noodles are almost ready.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.480
Have some with me in a bit.

00:11:31.539 --> 00:11:32.379
I just ate.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.279
With Ms. Liu...

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:34.919
...and Xiao Cai.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.679
After we finished eating...

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.940
...we went on to sing.

00:11:38.139 --> 00:11:39.500
We sang a new song.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:46.399
Flowers of Happiness Bloom All Around.

00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:47.460
Come on.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.480
You call that a new song?

00:11:49.559 --> 00:11:50.620
It's ancient.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.600
Besides, your singing was terrible.

00:11:53.139 --> 00:11:54.000
Listen to mine.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.779
Our Lives Are Filled with Sunshine.

00:11:58.779 --> 00:12:00.840
Filled with Sunshine.

00:12:00.879 --> 00:12:01.399
Alright.

00:12:01.399 --> 00:12:02.519
Yours isn't that great either.

00:12:02.779 --> 00:12:04.399
But Ms. Liu, on the other hand...

00:12:04.539 --> 00:12:06.059
...professionals just sing better.

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:07.379
The moment she opens her mouth...

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:10.379
...that voice...

00:12:11.879 --> 00:12:12.480
Ms. Liu!

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.159
Something's happened!

00:12:16.019 --> 00:12:17.139
Xiao Cai, don't be scared, Xiao Cai

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:17.679
Don't be scared

00:12:17.679 --> 00:12:18.159
Don't be scared

00:12:18.159 --> 00:12:19.259
It's okay

00:12:19.259 --> 00:12:19.919
Ms. Liu

00:12:21.059 --> 00:12:21.460
What happened?

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:22.100
Nothing

00:12:22.159 --> 00:12:22.919
Are you alright?

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:23.480
Ms. Liu

00:12:23.519 --> 00:12:24.059
Yes

00:12:24.059 --> 00:12:24.759
How are you?

00:12:24.879 --> 00:12:26.519
I'm fine, but Xiao Cai...

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.019
That's good then

00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:29.860
What do you two mean?

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.820
Why is it "good" when it comes to me?

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.159
No, you're okay, isn't that good?

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.519
What's wrong? What happened?

00:12:35.019 --> 00:12:35.679
What's the problem?

00:12:35.679 --> 00:12:37.120
Is there a problem we need to solve? Right

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:37.720
Xiao Cai

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.659
What happened to you?

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.600
Tell us about it

00:12:39.679 --> 00:12:40.220
Right

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:40.940
Well, it's just...

00:12:41.559 --> 00:12:42.379
Just now...

00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:45.659
I met a hooligan

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:46.500
What?

00:12:47.399 --> 00:12:48.240
A hooligan?

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.340
In broad day...

00:12:52.179 --> 00:12:53.580
In broad dark night...

00:12:54.039 --> 00:12:55.440
A hooligan got into our community

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.919
And he even harassed an old lady

00:12:58.940 --> 00:12:59.480
Xiao Cai

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:00.779
Tell us

00:13:01.539 --> 00:13:02.740
What did this hooligan do to you?

00:13:04.419 --> 00:13:05.120
Well...

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.559
Not much really

00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:10.220
Don't have any reservations

00:13:10.379 --> 00:13:11.120
Be brave

00:13:11.299 --> 00:13:12.059
Be bold

00:13:12.559 --> 00:13:13.759
The more specific, the better

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:14.980
Aren't you a pervert?

00:13:15.419 --> 00:13:16.279
Just understanding the situation

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.960
It was just Ms. Liu and me

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.120
We were sitting here singing

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.779
Sweet work

00:13:25.779 --> 00:13:27.740
is infinitely good, hey

00:13:27.899 --> 00:13:29.720
Sweet songs...

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.419
Xiao Cai

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:31.120
Xiao Cai

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.240
Don't sing

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.500
Didn't you say the more specific, the better?

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:35.940
I didn't ask you to sing

00:13:36.279 --> 00:13:36.860
What happened next?

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:37.360
Next...

00:13:37.419 --> 00:13:38.779
Ms. Liu and I were singing

00:13:38.779 --> 00:13:39.720
We were singing just fine

00:13:39.879 --> 00:13:40.379
Then...

00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:41.340
There was a black shadow

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:43.159
Then it went around behind me

00:13:43.279 --> 00:13:43.899
And then...

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.159
Whoosh, just like that

00:13:45.659 --> 00:13:47.120
I felt like he was trying to pick my pocket

00:13:48.759 --> 00:13:50.039
So it was just a thief

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:50.840
Not a hooligan

00:13:53.039 --> 00:13:53.740
Well...

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.379
The word "hooligan"...

00:13:55.679 --> 00:13:56.960
In ancient times in our country...

00:13:57.019 --> 00:13:58.299
Referred to vagrants

00:13:58.679 --> 00:13:59.679
So a thief...

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:00.899
Can also be a hooligan

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:02.759
But a hooligan isn't necessarily a thief

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:03.259
Stop

00:14:03.779 --> 00:14:05.700
We don't have time for your lecture right now

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:06.679
Xiao Cai

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.259
Did you see...

00:14:08.259 --> 00:14:09.600
What that thief looked like?

00:14:10.259 --> 00:14:11.139
Well...

00:14:11.539 --> 00:14:12.379
I really...

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:13.519
Didn't see

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:15.940
Then you... He went behind me

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:16.940
I don't have eyes in the back of my head

00:14:18.419 --> 00:14:19.179
That's true

00:14:19.539 --> 00:14:20.480
If you had eyes in the back of your head...

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.679
Wouldn't you be Voldemort?

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:23.340
Ms. Liu

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.019
Did you see anything?

00:14:26.159 --> 00:14:27.580
I actually did see something

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.919
Unfortunately, not clearly

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:30.179
No, I...

00:14:30.179 --> 00:14:31.759
I just saw a silhouette

00:14:31.919 --> 00:14:33.720
It was thin and small

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:35.379
Very agile

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.000
A professional cat burglar

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:40.179
It seemed like...

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.519
there was a knife hanging from his backside.

00:14:43.259 --> 00:14:44.919
A weapon, too? That's serious!

00:14:45.179 --> 00:14:45.919
And then what?

00:14:46.039 --> 00:14:46.799
And then...

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.440
Xiao Cai just screamed.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.059
Then we saw a figure...

00:14:50.059 --> 00:14:51.639
whoosh, it flew past over there.

00:14:52.879 --> 00:14:54.080
Now that you mention it, I remember.

00:14:54.179 --> 00:14:54.840
It seemed just...

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:55.399
just...

00:14:55.399 --> 00:14:56.500
it went whoosh, whoosh like that.

00:14:56.759 --> 00:14:57.080
Okay.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.019
Okay.

00:14:58.539 --> 00:14:59.500
Everyone, follow my command.

00:14:59.919 --> 00:15:00.419
Professor Fan,

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:01.879
you accompany Ms. Liu and Xiao Cai...

00:15:01.879 --> 00:15:02.159
Okay.

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:03.279
back to your respective rooms.

00:15:03.279 --> 00:15:04.000
Lock your doors and windows.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.519
Check if you've lost anything.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:06.360
A Jian, A Qiang,

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.980
you two come with me to catch the thief.

00:15:08.159 --> 00:15:08.759
Keep up.

00:15:09.039 --> 00:15:09.940
Yes, yes.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:14.600
This...

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:15.960
he really had a blast today.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:16.799
Quick, let's go back.

00:15:16.799 --> 00:15:17.340
Let's go.

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:18.120
Let's go.

00:15:23.919 --> 00:15:24.399
Keep up!

00:15:25.639 --> 00:15:26.279
Keep up!

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:39.659
Listen up.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.720
Once the thief appears,

00:15:42.019 --> 00:15:42.820
the two of you just...

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:43.600
charge!

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.240
Yes, sir!

00:15:44.299 --> 00:15:44.759
Wait.

00:15:45.279 --> 00:15:46.059
What about you?

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:47.860
I'll be cheering you on!

00:15:48.019 --> 00:15:48.500
Go, go!

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.080
Go, go!

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.620
Go, go!

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:52.620
Don't actually make a sound.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:53.639
Or the thief will hear you.

00:15:53.639 --> 00:15:54.220
Okay.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:15:59.679
Who are you afraid will hear?

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:05.179
Who are you trying to scare, old brother?

00:16:05.559 --> 00:16:06.940
Who's scaring whom?

00:16:07.019 --> 00:16:08.039
It's the middle of the night.

00:16:08.059 --> 00:16:09.360
You're right under my window,

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.960
sneaking around. What are you doing?

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:11.840
No, we...

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:12.720
we are...

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.320
Didn't you hear Xiao Cai shouting just now?

00:16:15.659 --> 00:16:17.159
A thief has entered our community.

00:16:17.379 --> 00:16:18.460
What thief?

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:19.259
Nonsense.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.240
There's no thief here.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.799
Ms. Liu saw him.

00:16:23.019 --> 00:16:24.159
Small and thin.

00:16:24.279 --> 00:16:25.320
Agile.

00:16:25.419 --> 00:16:27.179
And he's got a knife hanging from his backside.

00:16:27.899 --> 00:16:28.759
He has a knife?

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.220
So?

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.779
Do you have any clues?

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:33.779
Clues?

00:16:34.759 --> 00:16:35.600
I don't know.

00:16:35.799 --> 00:16:36.379
You...

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.480
Why don't you go check somewhere else?

00:16:38.519 --> 00:16:39.679
Hurry up and leave. Go on.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:42.919
Um...

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:43.960
maybe we should go.

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:45.399
Uncle Li.

00:16:45.899 --> 00:16:46.559
Uncle, my foot!

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.039
Why are you leaving?

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.059
We haven't caught the thief yet.

00:16:50.179 --> 00:16:51.639
But we're security guards.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:52.919
Disturbing an elder's rest...

00:16:52.919 --> 00:16:54.200
is also against the rules.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.419
Then how about...

00:16:55.419 --> 00:16:56.639
you search here first.

00:16:56.779 --> 00:16:58.539
We'll go look around elsewhere.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.240
Come back!

00:16:59.399 --> 00:17:00.039
Come back!

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.639
How can you leave?

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.299
Leaving me here alone, what's the big idea?

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:06.119
That thief has a weapon.

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:07.700
As the saying goes,

00:17:08.059 --> 00:17:09.119
"If a thief holds a knife,

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:10.140
even the police are helpless."

00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:11.599
You two can't leave.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:13.799
Then... we won't leave.

00:17:14.059 --> 00:17:14.579
But...

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.359
please don't make any more noise.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:17.220
I won't make a sound.

00:17:17.299 --> 00:17:18.039
Is that better?

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:20.259
Keep up.

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:20.740
Quick.

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:21.660
Keep up.

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.519
Who's commanding whom?

00:17:29.079 --> 00:17:30.180
Don't make a sound.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:31.700
Who's making a sound, old brother?

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:32.880
Old brother...

00:17:33.799 --> 00:17:34.640
Old Brother Shan.

00:17:35.319 --> 00:17:36.539
Is this old man's surname Shan?

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.099
Isn't it written right here?

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:38.960
Shan.

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:41.400
Darn it.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.500
The thief is in the old man's room!

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.079
Quick, break the door down!

00:17:45.819 --> 00:17:46.579
Watch me.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:49.400
Watch him.

00:17:49.859 --> 00:17:51.119
My head is still dizzy from earlier.

00:17:51.119 --> 00:17:51.539
Go!

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:54.160
Watch this.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.619
Washing my hands...

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:01.400
Hurry up.

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:02.960
Watch me.

00:18:04.319 --> 00:18:05.680
Oh no!

00:18:05.759 --> 00:18:07.000
Help!

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.180
The thief got into Old Shan's room!

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.339
He knocked the old man down!

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:13.519
Someone help!

00:18:21.059 --> 00:18:21.859
Imperial Physician Sun,

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.660
how is Old Shan doing?

00:18:25.559 --> 00:18:26.819
Well...

00:18:28.819 --> 00:18:30.259
it could be bad...

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.019
it's quite possible...

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.799
I'm afraid it's...

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:41.180
nothing serious.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.500
If it's nothing serious, why all this...

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:46.160
why are you...

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.319
what are you doing there?

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:48.779
Well, I...

00:18:48.799 --> 00:18:50.839
had a bowl of tofu pudding this morning.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.059
Did it get stuck in your teeth?

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:53.180
You should've said so earlier.

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:54.059
Here.

00:18:54.579 --> 00:18:55.220
Thanks.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.819
Getting tofu pudding stuck in your teeth?

00:19:00.019 --> 00:19:01.599
You'd probably get water stuck in there too!

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:04.200
And you too, Old Shan.

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:05.539
You were closing the window,

00:19:05.539 --> 00:19:07.039
how did you manage to fall flat on your face?

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.339
Luckily we hadn't gone far.

00:19:08.339 --> 00:19:09.059
We heard the noise.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.119
Otherwise, you'd have been on the floor all night.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.220
Pfft.

00:19:12.599 --> 00:19:14.000
If you hadn't been

00:19:14.039 --> 00:19:15.960
making a racket under my window tonight,

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.019
causing trouble...

00:19:17.279 --> 00:19:18.259
I turned around,

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.480
stepped on those soybeans, and fell flat.

00:19:22.259 --> 00:19:23.500
Save your breath.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.460
My medical bills,

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:26.799
lost wages,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.819
Compensation for lost youth...

00:19:29.319 --> 00:19:30.240
you have to pay for it all.

00:19:31.119 --> 00:19:32.180
Now he's trying to extort us.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:34.640
Seeing the doctor in our nursing home

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:35.640
is free of charge.

00:19:36.299 --> 00:19:37.039
Elder Shan,

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.779
I've finished your examination.

00:19:38.779 --> 00:19:39.660
It's nothing serious.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.619
Nothing serious.

00:19:40.759 --> 00:19:42.859
It's just that your waist and ribs

00:19:42.859 --> 00:19:44.559
have some soft tissue contusion.

00:19:44.619 --> 00:19:46.079
I've prescribed some topical medication.

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:47.500
If you're still worried,

00:19:47.559 --> 00:19:48.759
contact your family

00:19:48.859 --> 00:19:49.619
and go to the hospital.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:50.579
No, get a comprehensive...

00:19:50.579 --> 00:19:52.500
Don't contact anyone. I have no family.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.680
I'm all alone.

00:19:56.539 --> 00:19:57.700
You know, people...

00:19:58.359 --> 00:20:00.259
why aren't they as good as animals?

00:20:02.019 --> 00:20:03.140
Like you lot.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.240
My son...

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.299
Don't lump us in with your son.

00:20:08.299 --> 00:20:09.619
Isn't that taking advantage of us?

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.579
I mean you're all the same as my son.

00:20:14.819 --> 00:20:16.319
Not a decent one among you.

00:20:17.599 --> 00:20:18.240
Get out!

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:20.400
Get out!

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:22.339
All of you, get out!

00:20:22.759 --> 00:20:24.539
Old Shan, why are you like this?

00:20:24.539 --> 00:20:25.380
Stubborn,

00:20:25.519 --> 00:20:26.180
and always

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:27.319
spoiling for a fight!

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:27.900
Enough.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:29.180
Enough, Boss Li. Stop talking.

00:20:29.259 --> 00:20:29.940
Let's go.

00:20:30.319 --> 00:20:30.940
Let's go.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:31.980
Don't stoop to his level.

00:20:32.059 --> 00:20:33.140
Uh, Elder Shan,

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:35.700
try to avoid strenuous exercise.

00:20:36.079 --> 00:20:37.720
I know, I know. Just go.

00:20:38.059 --> 00:20:39.680
Mind your soft tissues.

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.539
Close the door on your way out!

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:47.819
That old man Shan nearly drove me crazy.

00:20:50.799 --> 00:20:51.279
Professor Fan.

00:20:52.819 --> 00:20:54.619
How can you set such an uncivilized example?

00:20:55.259 --> 00:20:55.980
What's wrong?

00:20:56.599 --> 00:20:58.279
Don't you know that our Willow New Town

00:20:58.279 --> 00:20:59.519
is a smoke-free community?

00:21:00.019 --> 00:21:01.220
And yet you're smoking.

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:02.500
Smoking a pipe, no less.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.160
It's an empty pipe.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.400
Then why are you coughing?

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.220
Why smoke it if it's empty?

00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:11.460
Just to satisfy the craving.

00:21:11.599 --> 00:21:12.579
Like a rubber pacifier?

00:21:13.619 --> 00:21:14.380
With this outfit of mine,

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.220
and a pipe in my mouth,

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.079
combined with my image and temperament,

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.339
don't you think I look like...

00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:22.259
Like a patient who escaped from Bedlam.

00:21:23.559 --> 00:21:25.099
The great detective, Sherlock Holmes.

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:25.799
No.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:26.619
My surname is Fan.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.640
Fan Holmes.

00:21:28.319 --> 00:21:29.359
Wood ear mushroom shreds?

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.500
Is that a cold dish?

00:21:31.619 --> 00:21:32.259
Don't be silly.

00:21:32.859 --> 00:21:34.559
Don't disturb my deduction of the case.

00:21:36.119 --> 00:21:37.440
Deduction of the case?

00:21:37.779 --> 00:21:38.859
For a matter this small,

00:21:39.819 --> 00:21:41.759
isn't it just a thief? Call the police.

00:21:42.279 --> 00:21:43.880
Once the police arrive, the truth will be out.

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:46.599
Once the police arrive, the truth will be out.

00:21:46.599 --> 00:21:47.359
That's right.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.019
Then what will happen in the next episode?

00:21:51.359 --> 00:21:51.859
What?

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:53.000
Next episode?

00:21:53.299 --> 00:21:53.960
What are you talking about?

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.220
I meant to say...

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:57.039
we can't call the police.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:58.720
If we don't call the police, what do we do?

00:21:59.799 --> 00:22:00.680
Let me tell you.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.799
I've been busy all day today.

00:22:03.099 --> 00:22:04.740
Going door to door doing a survey.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.400
And guess what?

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.480
From last night until now,

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:10.420
no one has lost anything at all.

00:22:12.259 --> 00:22:13.339
Then what is going on?

00:22:13.559 --> 00:22:14.359
Exactly.

00:22:14.779 --> 00:22:15.619
How can we report it?

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:17.440
How would the police open a case?

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.440
Just saying we saw a shadow,

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.500
but nothing was stolen?

00:22:20.539 --> 00:22:22.359
That our old eyes didn't see clearly?

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:23.400
Does that make sense?

00:22:24.619 --> 00:22:25.559
Then what do you suggest?

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:26.839
If you ask me,

00:22:26.839 --> 00:22:27.900
this matter must be...

00:22:28.359 --> 00:22:29.019
Professor Fan!

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:29.799
Boss Li!

00:22:31.099 --> 00:22:31.900
What's wrong?

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:33.980
Did you catch the thief?

00:22:34.319 --> 00:22:34.960
No.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:36.680
It's Shan.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.180
He ran out.

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.599
His soft tissue...

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.019
Let's go.

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:45.839
Excuse me.
