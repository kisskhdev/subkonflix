WEBVTT

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.840
Hey fam,

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.359
right now we're on the bus

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:26.040
heading to Donghu Park.

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:28.760
Ladies, are you doing the East Lake Jump today?

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.079
We'll see.

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:30.599
We'll see how it goes. It depends on Xiao Yin.

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:32.519
But Xiao Yin definitely isn't jumping.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.719
She's counting on this modern Chinese-style dress

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:36.120
to stun the whole crowd.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.640
Welcome everyone to this year's East Lake Jump!

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.159
Let me hear some noise!

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.719
Not enough, not enough!

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:47.239
Let's make some noise!

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.000
Our annual East Lake Jump,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.799
I know everyone's been looking forward to it.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.840
Let's take this hot afternoon

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.079
and cool down this summer!

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:03.040
Man, seriously. I give up.

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:05.959
Bro, hurry, hurry!

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.480
What are you doing?

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.479
What took you so long?

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.479
I've got a family to support.

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:12.479
Unlike a loafer like you.

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:13.199
Hurry, come with me, quick.

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:15.439
Is Xurui here?

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.479
Not yet.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.439
She's the team leader,

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:18.520
so she has to come on the school bus.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.280
Wait, what's wrong with you?

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.000
Don't tell me you chickened out.

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:23.120
I didn't chicken out.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.360
A couple of days ago,

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.240
there was a misunderstanding.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.560
I'm afraid she doesn't want to see me.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.840
Maybe I shouldn't come.

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:30.120
What happened?

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.400
Just a bit of a misunderstanding.

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:33.919
Bro, what are you talking about?

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:35.199
Anyway, no matter what,

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:36.719
just listen to me today.

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:38.280
Everything is under my control.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.319
After today,

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:40.759
I guarantee she'll change her mind about you.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.360
For real?

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.960
Let's go.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.759
Come on.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.439
It's all arranged.

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.479
Bro.

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.840
Where is it?

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.159
Stand here.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.639
Open your eyes wide and get ready.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.319
Is this cool or what?

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.759
A yellow bike and a camera.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.120
You jump while riding it.

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:04.240
Surprised, aren't you?

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.639
That's not all, there's more.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.919
Here.

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:07.759
Hold this.

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:09.919
Hold it, come on.

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:12.039
One, two, there you go!

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.919
Lin Xurui,

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:14.400
in life I'm yours,

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.919
in death I'm your ghost.

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.400
Kong Xiaocan.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.240
What are you doing?

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:19.000
No, wait.

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:20.520
You didn't chicken out, did you?

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:22.199
Bro, don't chicken out!

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:23.000
Are you crazy?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.800
If you don't go now,

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.240
you won't even qualify to be a ghost. Keep it down!

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.000
Only a psycho would ride that thing.

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:27.960
Look,

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:30.560
if you don't charge now,

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.719
you'll really be a dead ghost.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.560
Excuse me,

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.039
could you move in one seat?

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.960
I'd like to sit here for a bit.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.360
Thanks, thank you.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.599
Xiaorui.

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:01.719
About that... about Xiaocan.

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:02.439
Well, I...

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.479
I have something to discuss with her.

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:06.639
I'll go... go over there.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.439
I'm his mom

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.519
I had a serious illness

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.680
and used a miracle drug that was still in testing

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:26.959
which turned me into this

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:28.600
I know I look a bit young

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:38.920
Auntie

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.040
I...

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:43.240
Look at this mess I've made

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:45.079
It's all a misunderstanding

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.279
Xiaorui

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:48.519
Xiaocan really didn't mean to betray you

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.079
He's lucky to have met you

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:51.360
How could he betray you?

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.600
It's all my fault

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:53.879
I didn't explain things clearly

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:55.399
That child, Xiaocan...

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.480
he just doesn't know how to cherish things

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.600
Plus, our family went through such a big ordeal

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:00.800
Xiaorui

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.959
For Auntie's sake

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:05.480
please give Xiaocan another chance, okay?

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:12.759
A-Auntie

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.000
I'm sorry

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:22.839
A...

00:05:25.079 --> 00:05:25.759
I'm sorry, Auntie

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:27.959
I'm sorry

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.680
I'm sorry

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.319
Xiaorui!

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.199
Xiaorui, it's all a misunderstanding!

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.240
Darn it

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.240
Xurui won't even mention Xiaocan now

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:48.360
I messed up a perfectly good situation

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.879
Xiaocan, Mom is sorry

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.920
Hello?

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.120
Junior Kong, come find me as soon as you get off

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:00.920
I have a job for you wearing a mascot suit

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.000
Find someone else for this job

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:03.040
Don't be so quick to refuse

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:04.800
When we elect the Deputy Head next year

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.720
you'll know how important

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.439
these daily efforts are

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:08.519
I really don't want to go

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:09.759
Wear it yourself if you want

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:18.319
It'd fit you perfectly

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.680
It's practically custom-made for you

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:22.560
Your task

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:23.480
is very simple

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.920
Just put on this suit

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:26.759
walk around in the crowd

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.759
shout a bit, and jump around

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:31.720
But remember the key movements

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.000
I'll teach you. Come on

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.160
Hunch over

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:36.600
Bend your knees

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.360
Most importantly, curl your hands

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:40.199
Jump

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.680
Very good

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:44.120
Head on

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.040
Go on

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.079
Guys, I'm taking you to see the East Lake Jump

00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:52.199
Are the warriors ready?

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:57.480
Let's have our first warrior jump!

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:58.800
There, there, there!

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:06.519
That looks so fun

00:07:07.079 --> 00:07:09.000
I want to play with them too

00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:15.839
Right

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:16.839
Jump

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:17.920
Jump up!

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:19.439
Go!

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.399
Go steal the spotlight!

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:25.480
I'm roasting in here

00:07:25.959 --> 00:07:29.160
Is our second warrior ready?

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:29.839
Look!

00:07:31.079 --> 00:07:33.959
Turkey head! Turkey head! Turkey head!

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.240
The second warrior

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.680
That's a very unique look

00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:42.040
So cool!

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:42.439
This one...

00:07:42.439 --> 00:07:43.040
How was the jump?

00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:47.120
I guess it only scores points for style

00:07:47.439 --> 00:07:48.480
Our third one...

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:48.959
Is there another?

00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:51.040
Number three! Number three! Number three!

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.600
Let's go!

00:08:44.879 --> 00:08:46.159
It's a female warrior

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:48.519
Look, it's a girl

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.240
Even a girl dares to jump

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.679
She's so brave. Go for it!

00:08:52.679 --> 00:08:53.360
Go for it!

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.000
Today

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:57.679
That's amazing

00:08:57.679 --> 00:09:00.159
Courage is the true focus of our attention

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.840
Let's give a round of applause for this female warrior

00:09:05.559 --> 00:09:06.960
Another young lady

00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:12.159
Fam

00:09:12.159 --> 00:09:13.840
I give up. I'm too scared to jump

00:09:14.559 --> 00:09:15.639
Too scared to jump, so I'll dance instead

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.600
Look, so many people are watching the DJ girl too

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.440
She's so confident

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.360
Confident people become the focus wherever they are

00:09:25.759 --> 00:09:27.559
They all seem to be shining

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.919
They're all so eye-catching

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:32.960
In comparison

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.360
I always thought

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.039
dressing beautifully would win attention

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.519
What a shallow thought

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.960
I really feel ashamed

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.399
Why isn't Gui Fang here yet?

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.799
Yeah, where is Gui Fang?

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:46.519
Exactly

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:47.200
Where is she?

00:09:47.279 --> 00:09:48.639
Should I give her a call to check?

00:09:48.679 --> 00:09:49.559
Sure, give her a call

00:09:49.559 --> 00:09:50.440
Haven't seen her in a while

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.759
So cute

00:09:54.759 --> 00:09:55.320
Gangzi

00:09:55.519 --> 00:09:56.480
Is that you, Gangzi?

00:09:57.279 --> 00:09:58.440
Who do you think it is?

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:00.720
Fang'er

00:10:00.919 --> 00:10:02.039
Why is it you?

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:02.919
Oh my god

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.000
You're gonna get heatstroke in this

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.000
It's fine, it's fine

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.080
Why is it so thick?

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.080
It's just a little hardship

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:10.720
What hardship? Why suffer?

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.360
Hardship is meant for those who can take it

00:10:13.559 --> 00:10:14.279
You say it's nothing

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.240
but why put ourselves through that?

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.519
Last time. It's the last time

00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:20.600
Tell that Student Council senior to have a heart

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.159
You must be burning up, Fang'er

00:10:24.159 --> 00:10:24.919
I'm fine

00:10:25.159 --> 00:10:25.799
It's okay, it's okay, Fang Fang

00:10:26.039 --> 00:10:27.240
You didn't see them do the East Lake Jump, did you?

00:10:27.399 --> 00:10:27.960
No

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.799
It was really fun

00:10:28.799 --> 00:10:29.679
I recorded it all. Look

00:10:29.759 --> 00:10:32.279
Even the schedule for this event was made by you

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.639
Doesn't that mean you're the only one working?

00:10:36.039 --> 00:10:37.000
Those who can, do more

00:10:37.559 --> 00:10:39.600
It's also a validation of my abilities

00:10:39.759 --> 00:10:40.679
No, if you ask me

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.399
menial tasks like running errands

00:10:42.759 --> 00:10:44.480
you should just let the freshmen do it

00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:47.799
Unlike your school, which has so much talent

00:10:48.159 --> 00:10:49.639
The new people at our school

00:10:49.759 --> 00:10:50.799
aren't much use yet

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.840
These kids nowadays

00:10:59.080 --> 00:10:59.960
lack initiative

00:11:01.759 --> 00:11:02.759
Damn Gangzi

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.399
If I see you bullying Gui Fang again

00:11:04.559 --> 00:11:05.799
watch out or I'll kick you to the moon

00:11:05.879 --> 00:11:06.399
Wear it yourself

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:08.879
Hurry up

00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:15.919
Look

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.480
They jumped pretty far

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:17.960
Yeah

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.399
The entry was super clean

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:22.720
So brave

00:11:25.639 --> 00:11:27.480
This girl's form is perfect

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.320
Yeah, this girl

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.279
was especially elegant when hitting the water

00:11:29.279 --> 00:11:30.039
You guys wait for me a moment

00:11:30.039 --> 00:11:30.919
I'll be right back

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:31.759
Okay

00:11:38.679 --> 00:11:39.240
Xiaorui

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.919
Xiaorui is ignoring me too

00:11:55.039 --> 00:11:56.279
Welcome back to

00:11:56.639 --> 00:11:59.200
the East Lake Jump event site

00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:01.720
Look, it's our goddess senior,

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:02.799
Sister Xurui

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
She's so classy

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.919
She's just wearing a simple shirt,

00:12:06.919 --> 00:12:08.320
yet she stands out so much in the crowd

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.919
She is really beautiful

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:11.960
That's her for you

00:12:12.159 --> 00:12:14.120
This is what a goddess should look like

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.519
Don't be timid! Don't back down!

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.039
Show us your confidence and courage!

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.679
The second half will be even more exciting and spectacular!

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:27.759
Where is Xiao Yin?

00:12:27.759 --> 00:12:28.480
Come on!

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:29.519
Where is Xiao Yin?

00:12:29.679 --> 00:12:30.080
Xiao Yin!

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.840
Wasn't Xiao Yin just here?

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:32.919
Didn't she go look for you?

00:12:33.879 --> 00:12:34.440
Look, guys!

00:12:34.759 --> 00:12:35.600
Someone's about to pull a stunt!

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.440
Is the track ready?

00:12:37.679 --> 00:12:38.879
But before that, I want to see

00:12:38.879 --> 00:12:40.399
if you guys are ready!

00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:41.240
Who is this?

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:42.360
Xiaocan

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:43.600
Xiaocan

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.440
Who is Xiaocan?

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.360
He's my cousin

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.080
Cousin! Cousin! Cousin!

00:12:52.759 --> 00:12:58.840
Cousin! Cousin! Cousin!

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.879
Go!

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:03.679
Get ready!

00:13:05.399 --> 00:13:06.000
Here it comes!

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:07.879
Here goes nothing

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:08.600
Let's do this!

00:13:09.679 --> 00:13:10.919
I am Kong Xiaocan!

00:13:12.639 --> 00:13:14.080
Don't call my name!

00:13:14.559 --> 00:13:16.639
He is Kong Xiaocan!

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.480
Don't call my name!

00:13:19.639 --> 00:13:20.879
Kong Xiaocan!

00:13:25.879 --> 00:13:27.320
Lin Xurui!

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.519
I'm coming!

00:14:38.799 --> 00:14:39.600
Bro, are you still alive?

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.000
Pants.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:41.759
I'm coming to save you!

00:14:41.759 --> 00:14:42.279
Pants.

00:14:43.559 --> 00:14:44.240
My pants.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.240
Pants.

00:14:46.759 --> 00:14:47.320
Pants.

00:14:49.039 --> 00:14:49.360
Xiaocan.

00:14:57.639 --> 00:14:58.600
Xiaocan can't swim.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.519
He won't drown, right?

00:14:59.679 --> 00:15:01.519
Today brings a very special confession.

00:15:01.519 --> 00:15:02.720
Let's take a look, shall we?

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.559
Okay!

00:15:05.639 --> 00:15:10.240
Lin Xurui is a rascal.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.399
May I ask who Ms. Lin Xurui is?

00:15:14.399 --> 00:15:16.600
Would you like to come out and claim your confession?

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:22.919
Xurui! Xurui! Xurui!

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.000
It seems this confession method isn't great.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.759
Ms. Lin Xurui doesn't seem to accept it.

00:15:28.279 --> 00:15:29.960
Then how about we give him some encouragement?

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.720
Yeah!

00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:35.000
Kong Xiaocan.

00:15:35.919 --> 00:15:36.480
Are you okay?

00:15:36.759 --> 00:15:37.440
Relax.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:40.759
No need to hold me.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:47.120
Xiaocan.

00:15:47.879 --> 00:15:48.399
Xiaocan.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:48.840
Kong Xiaocan.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:49.600
Xiaocan.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.000
Xiaocan, are you okay?

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.799
Do you really have a death wish?

00:15:52.879 --> 00:15:54.240
How could you, just to pursue love,

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.200
risk your life like that?

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.559
You jumped without knowing how to swim.

00:15:56.559 --> 00:15:57.000
No, no, no.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.279
Wrong person. It wasn't me.

00:15:58.559 --> 00:15:59.440
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.120
Xiaocan, you...

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.919
Don't do this, I can't breathe.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.120
As someone who's been there,

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.519
I'll give you some advice.

00:16:05.639 --> 00:16:06.120
Kong Xiaocan.

00:16:06.639 --> 00:16:08.000
I'll give you some advice.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000
As someone who's been there... Wrong person.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:09.720
Kong Xiaocan.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:10.360
Xiaocan.

00:16:11.399 --> 00:16:12.039
Your cousin...

00:16:12.879 --> 00:16:13.320
here...

00:16:14.679 --> 00:16:16.039
is really risking his life for love.

00:16:16.159 --> 00:16:16.879
Is he okay?

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.320
Student.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.519
Student, are you okay?

00:16:21.799 --> 00:16:22.360
Li Wai.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:22.759
Kong Xiaocan.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:23.519
Are you okay?

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.600
We did it big time, Kong Xiaocan.

00:16:25.799 --> 00:16:26.200
Cousin.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:27.759
Cousin, we did it.

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:29.360
We did it.

00:16:31.879 --> 00:16:32.279
We did it.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.240
Let's hear your voices

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.120
for our last group of warriors, okay?

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:39.480
Okay!

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.799
Let's go!

00:16:43.159 --> 00:16:44.639
Run! Run!

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:52.840
Xiaocan.

00:16:53.759 --> 00:16:56.200
Mom seems to have made things worse between you and Xurui.

00:16:56.919 --> 00:16:57.679
I'm sorry.

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:07.799
Xiao Yin

00:17:10.279 --> 00:17:10.680
Xiao Yin

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:14.119
I've been looking for you everywhere.

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:15.160
What are you doing here?

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:16.839
Why are you drinking?

00:17:17.519 --> 00:17:19.599
You're the only one who notices me.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:20.640
What's wrong?

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.119
Stop drinking.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.039
Come, drink with me.

00:17:24.559 --> 00:17:25.319
I'm not drinking, I'm not drinking. Hold this.

00:17:25.759 --> 00:17:26.839
Drinking too much is bad for your health.

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:28.000
I'm in a bad mood. Stop drinking, stop drinking.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.160
Just drink with me.

00:17:29.359 --> 00:17:30.319
You're in a bad mood? I'll talk with you.

00:17:30.319 --> 00:17:31.319
No drinking, okay? Be good.

00:17:32.319 --> 00:17:32.920
Listen to me.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:33.559
No.

00:17:38.799 --> 00:17:40.960
I haven't had such a satisfying drink in years.

00:17:41.759 --> 00:17:42.240
So satisfying.

00:17:46.279 --> 00:17:47.200
Gui Fang.

00:17:47.559 --> 00:17:48.079
I'm listening.

00:17:48.519 --> 00:17:50.920
Why is every other girl more confident than me?

00:17:51.319 --> 00:17:52.680
They're all so sparkling.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:53.920
Nonsense.

00:17:54.359 --> 00:17:55.319
They aren't sparkling.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.400
You are the brightest one.

00:17:59.119 --> 00:17:59.680
Yes.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000
I'm sparkling too.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.640
Since I was little, back home...

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:04.920
I was the very brightest.

00:18:08.319 --> 00:18:11.480
But I'm not anymore.

00:18:13.279 --> 00:18:14.720
Don't cry, don't cry.

00:18:15.839 --> 00:18:18.039
In my eyes, you are the prettiest one.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.400
You are the shiniest one.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:20.920
If you don't believe me, ask them.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:22.839
You guys say it.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.720
Is she the best-looking one?

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.119
Is she the most sparkling?

00:18:32.319 --> 00:18:34.119
They aren't saying anything.

00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:36.039
They said it in their hearts.

00:18:36.039 --> 00:18:36.960
I heard it.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.119
Believe me.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:39.519
You're lying.

00:18:41.319 --> 00:18:42.519
You are prettier than me.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:47.759
That's true.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.119
But I'm happy that you're prettier than me.

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:54.000
Cheers.

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:55.680
Cheers.

00:19:01.079 --> 00:19:02.319
Actually, those girls...

00:19:03.119 --> 00:19:04.079
Appearance is just their...

00:19:04.079 --> 00:19:06.039
...most insignificant strength.

00:19:06.119 --> 00:19:07.240
They aren't just pretty...

00:19:07.599 --> 00:19:08.359
...but also confident.

00:19:08.839 --> 00:19:09.559
And brave.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.759
They aren't even afraid to do the East Lake Jump in front of so many people.

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:14.240
What about me?

00:19:15.079 --> 00:19:16.039
Always hesitating.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.160
Even if I dared to jump now, it's too late.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:23.400
Go.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:24.720
Go to school, go dream.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:25.319
Go to...

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:26.319
You go to school.

00:19:26.319 --> 00:19:27.279
Live for yourself for once, okay?

00:19:27.279 --> 00:19:28.119
Let it be.

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:35.400
It doesn't matter.

00:19:38.119 --> 00:19:39.480
East Lake isn't going anywhere.

00:19:40.559 --> 00:19:42.119
It's not too late for us to jump now.

00:19:42.519 --> 00:19:44.359
We just need to do something crazy.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.279
What's the big deal?

00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:47.680
To do it...

00:19:48.519 --> 00:19:49.759
...is what takes courage.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:50.599
Let's go.

00:19:51.079 --> 00:19:52.440
We'll go do the East Lake Jump right now.

00:19:54.519 --> 00:19:54.880
Let's go.

00:19:56.079 --> 00:19:56.799
Go do the East Lake Jump.

00:19:57.759 --> 00:19:58.200
Let's go.

00:19:58.759 --> 00:19:59.119
Let's go.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.359
Beauty, you haven't paid the bill yet.

00:20:02.839 --> 00:20:03.599
It's that expensive?

00:20:03.799 --> 00:20:05.079
I even returned the ones you didn't drink.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.079
Student, the event ended at noon.

00:20:09.599 --> 00:20:11.440
It's almost dark. Why are you only coming now?

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:15.880
Late again.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.759
When will I be able to live...

00:20:17.759 --> 00:20:19.559
...a real university life?

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.279
Charge!

00:20:25.559 --> 00:20:26.319
Fang'er.

00:20:26.599 --> 00:20:29.039
Why is it scarier now that I'm sober?

00:20:29.359 --> 00:20:30.640
Don't be afraid.

00:20:30.839 --> 00:20:32.000
Charge with me.

00:20:36.519 --> 00:20:40.240
Here we come.

00:21:33.559 --> 00:21:38.519
I am a big fool.

00:21:39.559 --> 00:21:46.319
I really don't want to live on this earth anymore.

00:21:47.359 --> 00:21:50.839
I'm too ashamed to live here.

00:21:51.279 --> 00:21:54.160
I committed social suicide.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:58.440
Social suicide.

00:21:58.799 --> 00:22:02.480
I don't want to live.

00:22:02.759 --> 00:22:05.839
It's really such social suicide.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:06.920
I...

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:20.680
Bro

00:22:22.119 --> 00:22:22.640
Hit me

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.960
Hit me with these iron bars

00:22:25.759 --> 00:22:28.400
I once had a friend

00:22:28.519 --> 00:22:30.839
Bro, I've blocked him now

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:31.920
Otherwise I'll feel guilty

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.000
I don't want to deal with you

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.160
Why don't you unblock me on WeChat?

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.519
I just want to delete you

00:22:35.519 --> 00:22:36.720
Bro, just want to delete you

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.759
Just hit me

00:22:37.839 --> 00:22:38.880
Don't even think about it. Xiaocan-ge

00:22:39.359 --> 00:22:39.920
Come help me! What's wrong?

00:22:40.039 --> 00:22:40.839
Slow down, slow down

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.559
Cousin, what... what happened here?

00:22:42.839 --> 00:22:44.279
They did the East Lake Jump then went drinking

00:22:44.559 --> 00:22:45.400
Couldn't stop them at all

00:22:46.799 --> 00:22:47.559
How much did they drink?

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:50.759
Two bottles got them like this?

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.319
Two dozen

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.880
I think you need a beating

00:22:54.319 --> 00:22:55.039
Who told you to drink so much?

00:22:55.039 --> 00:22:55.920
Doing such dangerous things

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.240
I'm telling you, I'm totally fine

00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:58.680
Let me tell you guys

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.079
I can go do the East Lake Jump again right now

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:01.720
You... I...

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:02.880
I really underestimated...

00:23:09.119 --> 00:23:09.440
Get up

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.039
Lie down properly, lie down

00:23:12.039 --> 00:23:13.400
I'll put the clothes here. Sober up a bit

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:13.920
Take a nap

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.200
Then change into these

00:23:17.039 --> 00:23:18.079
Just nap a bit and recover

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.240
I still have to wash the sheets

00:23:21.079 --> 00:23:21.480
Oh my god

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:22.640
The clothes are here

00:23:28.519 --> 00:23:29.119
How is Cousin doing?

00:23:29.119 --> 00:23:29.759
She's fine, all good

00:23:29.759 --> 00:23:30.720
Should we make some hangover soup?

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:31.720
No, no, no

00:23:31.799 --> 00:23:33.640
Okay, okay. You two...

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:34.319
It's fine. Thanks for your help

00:23:34.319 --> 00:23:34.799
Go home

00:23:35.039 --> 00:23:35.880
Let us help you some more

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:36.440
No need, no need

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.039
I got this, I got this

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:37.880
Can you handle it?

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:38.559
No problem

00:23:38.559 --> 00:23:40.039
I haven't... haven't blocked you yet

00:23:40.039 --> 00:23:40.960
Stop talking nonsense

00:23:41.119 --> 00:23:41.559
Okay, okay, okay

00:23:41.559 --> 00:23:42.240
Alright, alright

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:45.960
Oh my god

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:54.920
Are you okay?

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.039
You alright?

00:23:58.839 --> 00:23:59.599
Can you hear me?

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.440
It's okay. I'm coming in

00:24:10.599 --> 00:24:11.000
Oh my god

00:24:12.039 --> 00:24:12.599
Um...

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:14.880
Um...

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.799
This... these clothes...

00:24:16.799 --> 00:24:18.079
You tidy up in a bit too

00:24:18.079 --> 00:24:18.799
Change into them

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:20.680
Then you sleep in that room with Gui Fang

00:24:21.319 --> 00:24:23.799
I'll just... You recover a bit, sober up

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:24.720
It's you

00:24:25.079 --> 00:24:25.519
It's me

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:26.359
Kong Xiaocan

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.119
What's wrong?

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:28.799
You recognize me?

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:30.920
Need any help?

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.319
Am I the prettiest?

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.799
"Are you the prettiest?"

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.799
Don't copy me

00:24:40.079 --> 00:24:42.240
I'm saying... you are...

00:24:43.079 --> 00:24:44.319
You... You aren't the prettiest

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:48.880
You're quite pretty though

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:52.680
No, no, no

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.079
It's okay. No

00:24:53.079 --> 00:24:53.720
It doesn't matter, doesn't matter

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.200
What I say doesn't count anyway, right?

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:56.720
As for beauty, I think...

00:24:56.799 --> 00:24:57.799
If you think you're the prettiest

00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.000
Isn't it good if others think so too?

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.319
But we don't look good just for others

00:25:00.559 --> 00:25:01.359
Why listen to me?

00:25:01.759 --> 00:25:03.160
Just change your clothes

00:25:04.079 --> 00:25:04.640
Call me if you need anything

00:25:08.799 --> 00:25:10.400
He's so gentle

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.200
He likes me

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:22.640
How's it going?

00:25:32.359 --> 00:25:33.599
This... oh my god

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:36.880
I'll wash it tomorrow

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.440
Xiaocan

00:25:52.039 --> 00:25:52.519
What's wrong?

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.480
Mom let you down.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.799
Mom didn't mean to mess things up.

00:26:01.799 --> 00:26:03.880
Mom really wanted to help you.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:07.599
You don't find me embarrassing?

00:26:13.079 --> 00:26:14.640
My son is the best.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:20.319
Fighting for what you want...

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.359
...is nothing to be ashamed of, no matter how messy it gets.

00:26:25.599 --> 00:26:27.359
Mom is proud of you.

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:33.640
You're pretty amazing too.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.000
I couldn't even drink two dozen.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:36.559
Go to sleep.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.000
You're not mad, are you?

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:05.519
Today was all Li Wai's idea.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.640
I was out of my mind to listen to him.

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:09.519
Go ahead and scold me.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:10.680
I'll listen and won't talk back.

00:27:11.799 --> 00:27:12.839
Please don't block me, okay?

00:27:14.079 --> 00:27:15.279
I won't bother you often.

00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:19.599
We each embarrassed ourselves once.

00:27:19.839 --> 00:27:20.359
We're even.

00:27:20.759 --> 00:27:21.160
Let's turn the page.

00:27:52.039 --> 00:27:52.720
Xiao Yin.

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:55.559
Xiao Yin, wake up.

00:28:05.359 --> 00:28:05.920
Wake up.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.240
How did we get back yesterday?

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:10.920
I don't know.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:15.839
Where is this?

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:18.079
This is my house.

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.680
I think I dreamed about Kong Xiaocan yesterday.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.559
Don't we have Tri-Field Class today?

00:28:49.799 --> 00:28:50.359
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

00:28:50.839 --> 00:28:52.200
Don't... don't sleep. We're late.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:53.640
Hurry, hurry, hurry. Get... get up.

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:54.640
What is it?

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.880
Change clothes. Tri-Field Class.

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:56.599
We're late.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.000
My head is spinning.

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:00.559
What class?

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.720
Tri-Field Class.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:03.200
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.000
Xiao Yin, hurry up.

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:05.720
Wait, something's wrong.

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:06.240
We're late!

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.160
I wasn't dreaming.

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:08.799
I think I really saw Kong Xiaocan.

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.000
Why was he at your house?

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.400
He's my cousin.

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:17.880
Why didn't you say so earlier?

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.519
You never asked me.

00:29:20.319 --> 00:29:21.079
Xiao Yin, hurry up.

00:29:22.559 --> 00:29:24.119
Great, the teacher isn't here yet. We're not late.

00:29:24.119 --> 00:29:24.720
Gui Fang is here.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.319
She made the front page of the school forum yesterday.

00:29:26.319 --> 00:29:26.920
Did you guys know?

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.240
Saw it. Joke of the year.

00:29:29.279 --> 00:29:29.599
Fang'er.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.680
That video was hilarious.

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:31.480
What took you so long?

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.119
Did you sleep until now, Xiao Yin?

00:29:34.359 --> 00:29:35.039
Look, quick.

00:29:35.799 --> 00:29:36.599
It sprouted! It sprouted!

00:29:36.599 --> 00:29:37.240
Stop filming.

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.000
I'm about to puke bean sprouts too.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:41.839
Take it easy.

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:44.400
How much did you drink?

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:45.160
Quick, look.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:46.759
It really sprouted.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.119
Yeah, why have all of yours sprouted?

00:29:49.119 --> 00:29:50.440
Mine haven't done a thing.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.240
None of yours have?

00:29:51.319 --> 00:29:52.079
No.

00:29:52.759 --> 00:29:53.720
Can I dig one up?

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:17.160
Junior

00:30:18.519 --> 00:30:19.000
I'm busy

00:30:21.759 --> 00:30:22.920
I was just saying hi

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:25.480
Classmate, could you...

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:25.880
No

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.920
Xiao Cao

00:30:30.759 --> 00:30:33.160
Please do your own work from now on

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:33.960
Okay?

00:30:34.079 --> 00:30:34.559
Xiao... Xiao...

00:30:35.119 --> 00:30:35.839
Xiao Cao?

00:30:37.079 --> 00:30:38.480
You don't call me Senior anymore?

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.200
I'm not slacking off

00:30:41.559 --> 00:30:43.200
I'm giving the rookies a chance to practice

00:30:43.519 --> 00:30:44.839
I'm just distributing the work

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.799
Stop making empty promises

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.680
You're a perfectly good college student

00:30:48.839 --> 00:30:50.240
Can't you do something proper?

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.920
I don't know where you learned these bad habits

00:30:54.519 --> 00:30:55.200
Let me tell you

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.200
I'm the only one who'd tell you this now

00:30:57.359 --> 00:30:58.319
Once you enter the real world

00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.720
You'll suffer if you act like this

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:00.279
You know?

00:31:02.759 --> 00:31:03.720
Did you hear me?

00:31:05.359 --> 00:31:06.240
I really heard you

00:31:06.799 --> 00:31:07.160
Really

00:31:10.119 --> 00:31:10.480
Fine

00:31:11.079 --> 00:31:11.400
Go on

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.279
Why do I want to call her Mom?

00:31:24.079 --> 00:31:24.440
Gui Fang

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:25.559
Gui Fang

00:31:27.079 --> 00:31:27.839
You've gone viral

00:31:36.799 --> 00:31:37.200
Xiao Yin

00:31:38.119 --> 00:31:38.960
Xiao Yin, look

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.359
No

00:31:42.799 --> 00:31:45.160
It's a lifetime of dark history

00:31:45.359 --> 00:31:45.720
Look

00:31:46.279 --> 00:31:47.559
It's only been up for an hour

00:31:47.799 --> 00:31:49.240
Shares and likes are already over a thousand

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:52.799
That's really great

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.799
Mom is just like you now

00:32:32.359 --> 00:32:32.759
Mom

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:34.799
I'm proud of you too

00:32:39.039 --> 00:32:40.119
But letting loose for once

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:41.279
Feels pretty good

00:34:11.599 --> 00:34:12.800
Jumping when you can't swim

00:34:14.119 --> 00:34:14.840
