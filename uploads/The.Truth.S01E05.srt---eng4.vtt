00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.541
Chen Yumo, a local from Yunxi City.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.020
Ten years ago, you were gang-raped.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.461
Afterward, your whole family moved away.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.821
Five years later,
your parents died in a car accident,

00:02:01.341 --> 00:02:02.860
and you returned to Yunxi.

00:02:03.372 --> 00:02:04.780
(Dan Qing/Chen Yumo Profile)

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.780
You met Huo at the nightclub.

00:02:07.341 --> 00:02:08.940
(Dan Qing/Chen Yumo Profile)
Then you went to the border.

00:02:10.061 --> 00:02:11.621
When the rape happened,

00:02:11.621 --> 00:02:13.021
you were only 16 years old.

00:02:15.461 --> 00:02:16.581
You had a boyfriend.

00:02:16.581 --> 00:02:18.861
He was your classmate
at Experimental High School.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.741
His name was Ye Qian.

00:02:21.461 --> 00:02:24.341
(And that Ye Qian is now a cop.)

00:03:03.301 --> 00:03:04.100
Xiang.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.660
It's our first deal.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.141
Mr. Bao wants to be cautious.

00:03:11.341 --> 00:03:12.901
We all understand that.

00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:14.660
But if just because

00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:16.380
an ex-boyfriend

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.672
she barely remembers became a cop

00:03:20.952 --> 00:03:22.660
makes you question us,

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.700
it makes Mr. Bao's reputation

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.220
seem pretty overrated.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.100
You say she doesn't remember her ex?

00:03:37.341 --> 00:03:40.220
Then why did he go looking for her
at that hotel you used?

00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:43.741
Who says I don't remember him?

00:03:44.301 --> 00:03:45.100
I remember him.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.021
I'll remember him till death.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.141
If I hadn't been with him...

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.260
Stop beating around the bush.

00:03:54.741 --> 00:03:55.660
What do you want?

00:03:57.301 --> 00:03:58.660
Prove your sincerity.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.901
Prove she's

00:04:00.141 --> 00:04:01.100
not a cop.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.901
Go tell Mr. Bao.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.061
If he doesn't trust me,
we don't have to work together.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:15.741
This is

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:18.500
unnecessary.

00:04:23.061 --> 00:04:24.500
Take Madman with you.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.820
Xiang.

00:04:45.221 --> 00:04:46.421
I've got a video here.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.940
- I'd like to share it with you.
- Run? Come back.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.621
Boss.

00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:53.020
I know I was wrong.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.020
Please let me go.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.181
You want to die?

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.500
Tighter.

00:04:57.661 --> 00:04:58.661
Run? Get back here.

00:04:58.661 --> 00:04:59.380
Boss!

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:00.661
I know I was wrong.

00:05:00.661 --> 00:05:01.781
Please let me go.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.500
Boss, I know I was wrong.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.861
I'll never do it again.

00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:47.301
Well done, Dan Qing.

00:06:15.781 --> 00:06:16.460
Okay.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:18.500
Got it.

00:06:23.301 --> 00:06:24.460
All four are dead?

00:06:26.301 --> 00:06:27.500
You can check for yourself.

00:06:30.301 --> 00:06:32.700
They're probably just listed as missing.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.301
As our boss just said,

00:06:37.741 --> 00:06:39.781
us meeting like this is fate,
a rare chance.

00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:42.221
So how about this?

00:06:42.421 --> 00:06:44.700
Let your girlfriend

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.020
keep in touch with her ex-boyfriend.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.900
After all, in our line of work,

00:06:50.541 --> 00:06:52.421
good relations with the cops can't hurt.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.820
Buried where?

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.421
Give me the location.

00:07:09.741 --> 00:07:10.541
Xiang.

00:07:13.421 --> 00:07:15.221
Send someone unrelated to this location.

00:07:16.221 --> 00:07:17.020
Take pictures.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.301
Understood.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.301
Just a moment.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.140
One order of wontons.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:55.940
Sure.

00:07:56.181 --> 00:07:56.940
- Okay.
- No spice.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:57.940
No chili peppers.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:58.900
Just a second.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:07:59.580
Okay.

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.421
Add some greens.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:03.460
Got it.

00:08:03.861 --> 00:08:04.380
Hello?

00:08:05.061 --> 00:08:07.181
Where are you with the takeout?

00:08:07.181 --> 00:08:07.861
I'm starving.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.020
Bag snatcher!

00:08:15.221 --> 00:08:17.541
Move! Get out of the way!

00:08:31.541 --> 00:08:32.460
Move!

00:08:43.021 --> 00:08:44.061
Looking for trouble, huh?

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.340
Stay back!

00:08:52.421 --> 00:08:53.301
I'll kill you!

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:05.860
Make way.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:07.381
Coming through.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:08.620
What happened?

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:12.661
City CID.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:13.781
Thanks for your help.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:14.901
We'll take it from here.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:17.980
Officers,

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:19.580
they're the ones who snatched my bag.

00:09:19.781 --> 00:09:20.980
Alright, come with us.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:21.620
Take them away.

00:10:08.376 --> 00:10:14.488
(Interview Room)

00:10:40.172 --> 00:10:43.512
(Ye Qian's Profile)

00:10:47.061 --> 00:10:47.860
Dan Qing,

00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:49.541
still tailing them?

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:52.021
Yes.

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:44.620
Didn't you grab the keys?

00:11:50.661 --> 00:11:52.261
What took you so long?

00:11:52.261 --> 00:11:53.781
You could have crawled back by now.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.381
What brings you here?

00:11:58.661 --> 00:11:59.740
Quick, come in.

00:12:00.141 --> 00:12:01.781
- Where's Little Qian?
- Hotpot delivery?

00:12:02.061 --> 00:12:03.421
He went to get the takeout.

00:12:04.781 --> 00:12:05.940
If I'd known you were coming,

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.340
I wouldn't have told him to go.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.580
Don't flatter yourself.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:09.620
I am not treating you.

00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:11.220
Don't say that.

00:12:11.421 --> 00:12:12.740
You've brought so much.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.421
It'd be wasteful
not to finish it, right?

00:12:15.061 --> 00:12:16.141
What are you waiting for?

00:12:16.301 --> 00:12:17.061
Set it up.

00:12:17.061 --> 00:12:17.740
Right away.

00:12:20.901 --> 00:12:22.381
Give Little Qian a call.

00:12:22.381 --> 00:12:23.261
Ask him where he is.

00:12:23.261 --> 00:12:24.381
He's been gone forever.

00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:25.460
I won't.

00:12:25.781 --> 00:12:28.021
If he knows I'm here,
he'll find an excuse to bolt again.

00:12:28.181 --> 00:12:28.740
You call.

00:12:29.301 --> 00:12:30.580
I just did.

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:31.700
He didn't answer.

00:12:32.661 --> 00:12:33.940
No need to call. He's back.

00:12:37.141 --> 00:12:37.940
Dad? Mom?

00:12:38.261 --> 00:12:38.980
What a surprise!

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:39.580
Give me that.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.421
Come on in.

00:12:40.421 --> 00:12:42.340
Should've told me.
I could've picked you up.

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.460
Do we need an appointment?

00:12:45.781 --> 00:12:46.552
This is...

00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:47.704
Let me introduce you.

00:12:48.141 --> 00:12:49.980
This is my good friend, Han Zhao.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.460
And these are my parents.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:52.820
Hello, ma'am, sir.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:53.661
Hello.

00:12:53.781 --> 00:12:54.541
Long,

00:12:54.541 --> 00:12:55.781
where's your roommate?

00:12:56.181 --> 00:12:58.021
The tall, slim, fair-skinned one?

00:12:58.061 --> 00:12:59.740
He went to get the takeout.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:00.820
He should be back soon.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:01.620
Sit down.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:02.940
Mom, I'll get you a chair.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.501
Sir, have a seat.

00:13:04.501 --> 00:13:05.240
Okay.

00:13:06.261 --> 00:13:06.980
Long,

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.021
how is this place still such a mess?

00:13:09.301 --> 00:13:10.940
I need to tidy up for you later.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.061
Please don't tidy up for me.

00:13:13.061 --> 00:13:13.940
You did it last time,

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.340
and then I couldn't find anything.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.061
Just sit down and enjoy your meal.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.860
Look at you, then look at Ye.

00:13:19.021 --> 00:13:20.421
How is he so neat and tidy?

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.820
What sauce? Sesame paste?

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:23.501
I'll mix one for you.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:24.501
Anything's fine.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.141
These foods look so fancy.

00:13:28.261 --> 00:13:28.980
I'm so sorry.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.781
We didn't know Long had company.

00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:34.220
We wouldn't have come to intrude.

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:35.501
It's fine.

00:13:35.501 --> 00:13:37.381
I brought plenty of food.

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:38.820
Let's just eat together.

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:40.781
Han, right?

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:42.580
How old are you?

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:44.061
What do you do?

00:13:44.381 --> 00:13:46.261
She owns a restaurant.

00:13:46.501 --> 00:13:47.901
A high-end one.

00:13:49.301 --> 00:13:51.781
Running a restaurant is no easy job.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:52.820
It's manageable.

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:54.021
When Long was little,

00:13:54.021 --> 00:13:55.501
he wanted to open a restaurant too.

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.220
That's quite a coincidence.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:13:59.181
Eat.

00:13:59.781 --> 00:14:00.740
You have no chopsticks.

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.421
I'll get you a pair.

00:14:08.141 --> 00:14:09.860
Do your parents misunderstand something?

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:10.860
Clear things up.

00:14:11.781 --> 00:14:12.901
Probably not.

00:14:12.901 --> 00:14:14.381
Maybe they just think you're pretty.

00:14:14.901 --> 00:14:15.940
If they are mistaken,

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.381
just deal with it.

00:14:18.381 --> 00:14:19.181
I'm totally fine.

00:14:19.421 --> 00:14:20.460
I'll hit you.

00:14:21.061 --> 00:14:22.141
Just joking.

00:14:24.381 --> 00:14:25.021
Here.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.580
Hurry up and text Little Qian.

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:32.580
Ma'am.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:33.100
Okay.

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:33.820
Sir.

00:14:41.484 --> 00:14:53.176
(Si Yuanlong: Little Zhao is here)

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:24.620
We're so sorry, Han,

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:26.301
to have you drive us home.

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:26.980
Yeah.

00:16:27.381 --> 00:16:28.580
It's fine, sir.

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:29.781
It's just a quick drive.

00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:30.781
Don't be polite with me.

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:32.781
Long, don't see us off.

00:16:32.781 --> 00:16:33.501
Go back.

00:16:34.021 --> 00:16:35.220
I'm already here. Let me.

00:16:35.381 --> 00:16:36.141
Alright.

00:16:36.141 --> 00:16:37.381
You don't get to visit often.

00:16:37.661 --> 00:16:38.940
Rest early. Don't stay up late.

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:39.460
Don't worry.

Stop playing
those violent games all day.

00:16:42.021 --> 00:16:43.421
Just get in the car.

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:45.301
Get in, ma'am.

00:16:46.301 --> 00:16:48.301
Little Zhao, sorry for the trouble.

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:50.340
- Bye-bye.
- It's fine.

00:16:50.781 --> 00:16:51.301
Okay.

00:16:51.301 --> 00:16:52.100
We're leaving now.

Got it.

Take care.

00:17:16.021 --> 00:17:17.620
Little Qian, they've left.

My bike broke.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:56.501
Can you take a look?

00:18:19.061 --> 00:18:20.100
It's leaking oil.

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.140
The tank is empty.

00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:25.860
Is it easy to fix?

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.100
I need to open it up to see.

00:18:28.541 --> 00:18:29.660
If it's good,

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:32.180
I can bore the cylinders
and replace the pistons.

00:18:32.781 --> 00:18:33.701
If it's serious,

00:18:33.701 --> 00:18:34.741
it requires a new block.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:38.180

(Route of the crime)

Based on this route,

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:26.620
we can confirm

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:28.900
that He Changchun
is fleeing the province.

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:30.021
We already know

00:19:30.021 --> 00:19:31.501
his last known location

00:19:31.741 --> 00:19:32.701
was Linshui Township.

00:19:32.888 --> 00:19:35.096
Less than 300 kilometers
south of Linshui is the border

00:19:35.096 --> 00:19:36.900

and the neighboring province.

Captain Liao is rushing here now.

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.380
The roads around Linshui
are very complex.

00:19:49.461 --> 00:19:51.140
Manpower and time are both issues.

00:19:52.021 --> 00:19:52.900
True.

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.580
If we canvass the area
and launch a manhunt,

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:56.820
the efficiency will be low.

00:19:57.541 --> 00:19:59.420
If He Changchun senses something

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:00.580
and chooses to flee on foot,

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:02.820

south of Linshui,

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:04.380

Here's the auto repair shop address.

00:21:00.781 --> 00:21:02.620
Both the engine number and VIN match.

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.301
It has those stickers too.

00:21:04.301 --> 00:21:05.301

You guys are working on a Sunday?

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:13.860
Lend me a car, will you?

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:15.301
Doesn't he have one?

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.140
That place is far away.

Your...

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.620
Your bike is in bad shape.

00:21:45.301 --> 00:21:46.701
Can't fix it. Needs parts replaced.

00:21:48.941 --> 00:21:51.781
the piston rings and valve seals.

Both are shot.

But for your crankshaft case,

00:21:57.461 --> 00:21:58.660
I don't have one in stock.

From where?

00:22:23.064 --> 00:22:23.928
And by whom?

00:22:25.336 --> 00:22:27.100
Are there any other auto repair shops

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.580
around here besides yours?

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:31.660
Y-Yes.

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.061
It's just...

00:22:33.741 --> 00:22:35.100
Just a bit further away.

00:22:35.288 --> 00:22:36.741
There's one in the next town.

00:22:37.301 --> 00:22:38.420
Look, buddy.

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:40.580
W-What are you asking all this for?

00:22:40.781 --> 00:22:42.061
Are you fixing it or not?

00:22:42.461 --> 00:22:43.981
If you're not getting it fixed,

00:22:44.461 --> 00:22:45.781
I'll put it back together.

00:22:45.981 --> 00:22:47.860
Just pay the disassembly fee.

00:22:57.941 --> 00:22:58.741
Fix it.

00:23:02.021 --> 00:23:02.900
Okay. Wait a moment.

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.100
I'll have someone deliver it.

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:06.061
You know, the part is expensive.

00:23:06.061 --> 00:23:07.261

showed up at an auto repair shop
near Linshui.

Ye and Si Yuanlong
are both heading there.

We're rushing there now.

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:47.224
But with this rain,
we can't drive too fast.

00:23:47.224 --> 00:23:48.312
After getting the lead,

00:23:48.312 --> 00:23:50.021
we immediately contacted the local CID.

00:23:50.301 --> 00:23:51.701
They're on the way to assist.

00:23:52.741 --> 00:23:53.261
Okay.

00:23:54.221 --> 00:23:55.380
Hurry. As fast as possible.

Captain Leng, we're at the shop.

00:27:23.541 --> 00:27:24.941
He Changchun is driving east.

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:28.701
The owner is out. Get an ambulance.

00:31:45.301 --> 00:31:46.100

(Yunxi Police Department)

00:32:07.061 --> 00:32:08.140
Have some water.

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:17.340
Thanks. I was starving.

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:19.660
You're fed and watered?

This bag is yours, right?

00:32:33.221 --> 00:32:34.180
And this knife?

00:32:35.261 --> 00:32:35.981
It's mine.

00:32:42.461 --> 00:32:43.261
My parents.

00:32:47.981 --> 00:32:50.701
Why kill He Hongqing's whole family?

00:32:54.301 --> 00:32:55.261
They bullied us.

Explain it in detail.

00:32:58.420 --> 00:32:59.061
Okay.

00:33:00.741 --> 00:33:01.541
Let me tell you.

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:05.180
That year,

00:33:05.784 --> 00:33:06.860
my grandpa was very ill.

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.221
He called all his children
to divide the farmland.

00:33:11.541 --> 00:33:12.820
- My dad saw his dilemma.
- Little Qian.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.104
He let the others pick first.

00:33:14.104 --> 00:33:14.941
I can't open it.

00:33:14.941 --> 00:33:16.420
He ended up with the worst plot.

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:19.820
I spent three months
clearing rocks from that land

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:20.856
before planting anything.

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:23.461
The next year,

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:25.221
- during harvest...
- Thanks.

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:28.061
Good thing your tendon wasn't injured.

00:33:29.221 --> 00:33:31.420
- Long.
- My uncle, He Shanxiang...

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:32.860
Don't be so reckless next time.

00:33:33.541 --> 00:33:35.580
He brought a group to corner my dad

00:33:36.261 --> 00:33:37.900
and demanded those five acres back.

00:33:38.741 --> 00:33:39.941
They said Grandpa was senile,

00:33:39.941 --> 00:33:40.701
so it didn't count.

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:42.541
My dad argued with them,

00:33:42.541 --> 00:33:43.701
and they beat him up.

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:48.301
Yet my dad stayed silent
when he came home.

00:33:49.701 --> 00:33:51.061
Soon after, he died of anger.

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:53.541
(The irony is,)

00:33:53.848 --> 00:33:55.900
(they refused to bury him
in the He family graves.)

00:33:57.941 --> 00:33:59.221
I wouldn't stand for it then.

00:34:00.541 --> 00:34:01.820
But I still had my mom.

00:34:03.928 --> 00:34:06.264
She struggled to keep
the family together and raise me.

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:07.741
But then,

00:34:08.501 --> 00:34:10.501
they came to our place
on Chinese New Year's Eve

00:34:11.021 --> 00:34:12.740
(and smashed everything they could.)

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:15.220
(Mom fainted on the spot.)

00:34:15.352 --> 00:34:17.016
(At the hospital, they found cancer.)

00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:21.021
This year,

00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:23.740
my uncle's family
joined the village co-op

00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:24.821
for land transfers.

00:34:25.901 --> 00:34:28.220
They brought a land lease contract
to the hospital

00:34:28.541 --> 00:34:30.061
to trick my mom into signing.

00:34:30.901 --> 00:34:32.220
They harassed her over and over.

00:34:32.541 --> 00:34:34.341
Eventually, my mom
couldn't take it and died.

00:34:34.541 --> 00:34:35.580
The doctor said that

00:34:36.341 --> 00:34:37.461
had she not been so pressed,

00:34:37.461 --> 00:34:40.220
she might've lived another year or two.

00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:46.300
I'm the youngest in our generation.

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:48.780
They always bullied me growing up.

00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:50.861
I'd run home crying,

00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:52.061
and my dad would say,

00:34:52.541 --> 00:34:53.660
"They're family."

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:55.180
"They're fond of you

00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:56.541
and playing with you."

00:34:57.981 --> 00:34:59.861
My dad never fought back.

00:35:00.901 --> 00:35:02.140
He endured it his whole life

00:35:02.421 --> 00:35:03.620
until he was gone.

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:05.180
My mom endured it too,

00:35:05.901 --> 00:35:06.821
and now she's gone too.

00:35:07.501 --> 00:35:09.061
Now it's just me left.

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:12.381
I wanted to fight back.

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:14.461
Just this once.

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:18.501
Officer.

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:22.620
Do you think I was wrong?

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:25.780
Of course you were wrong.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:27.461
Why did you hurt more people?

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:32.620
That traffic cop

00:35:33.821 --> 00:35:35.341
suspected the motorcycle wasn't mine.

00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:38.021
He pressed me too hard. I had no choice.

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:40.981
The woman at the convenience store

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:42.740
scrolled on her phone.

00:35:42.941 --> 00:35:43.901
She saw the news

00:35:44.341 --> 00:35:45.341
and recognized me.

00:35:45.941 --> 00:35:47.381
And the auto repair shop owner

00:35:47.381 --> 00:35:48.421
was calling the police.

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:49.901
So I hurt him.

00:35:49.901 --> 00:35:50.780
What about Xu Gang?

00:35:52.461 --> 00:35:53.381
Who's Xu Gang?

00:35:53.381 --> 00:35:54.381
The motorcycle driver.

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:56.821
You stole his bike

00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:58.180
and then killed him.

00:35:58.780 --> 00:35:59.700
Remember now?

00:36:00.461 --> 00:36:01.541
I didn't know him.

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:03.341
(I didn't mean to kill him.)

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:05.580
(But he fought me desperately)

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:06.541
(over a motorcycle.)

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:08.700
(I panicked a bit.)

00:36:10.061 --> 00:36:11.901
(They were like)

00:36:11.981 --> 00:36:13.821
(a cornfield blocking my path.)

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:18.700
Whether I snapped them or chopped them,
I had to get through.

00:36:20.461 --> 00:36:24.501
You killed He Hongqing's whole family.

00:36:25.381 --> 00:36:27.061
Why did you spare the child?

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:32.580
I'm human,

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:34.620
not a monster.

00:36:37.341 --> 00:36:38.021
Besides,

00:36:39.064 --> 00:36:40.541
that kid hadn't done anything wrong.

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:43.780
After all this,

00:36:44.981 --> 00:36:46.981
you think your parents' deaths

00:36:47.421 --> 00:36:49.381
were entirely your uncle's fault.

00:36:50.341 --> 00:36:51.901
You think killing him was justified.

00:36:52.501 --> 00:36:54.260
If we hadn't caught you,

00:36:55.461 --> 00:36:56.421
were you going

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:03.180
to let your nephew settle that score

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:05.700
when he grew up?

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:08.300
To turn him into the next you?

00:37:08.901 --> 00:37:09.740
As you said,

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:11.580
that kid did nothing wrong.

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:13.421
The adults messed up.

00:37:14.021 --> 00:37:16.501
Why make a kid pay the price?

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:20.180
How are you any better than your uncle?

00:37:20.461 --> 00:37:21.140
Right.

00:37:21.901 --> 00:37:23.461
So I'm confessing everything now

00:37:25.941 --> 00:37:26.941
and cooperating fully.

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:28.421
I'm cooperating.

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:31.260
I wasn't trying to run.

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:34.300
My parents lived in that village

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:35.821
most of their lives

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:37.821
but never saw the real sea.

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:40.341
I wanted to take them to see it.

00:37:41.021 --> 00:37:42.220
The sea's better,

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.461
better than suffering
in the ancestral grave.

00:37:45.981 --> 00:37:46.740
Right?

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:54.620
Well? Want some more?

00:37:55.541 --> 00:37:56.580
No, I'm full.

00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:57.941
That's enough.

00:37:58.541 --> 00:38:00.180
We'll talk again next time, okay?

00:38:01.421 --> 00:38:02.260
Got it all down?

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:03.021
Yes.

00:38:03.021 --> 00:38:03.740
Officer.

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:05.941
Thank you.

00:38:06.421 --> 00:38:07.821
I've kept these things bottled up

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:11.700
and never told anyone.

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:23.300
(Your grievances deserved to be heard,)

00:38:24.061 --> 00:38:25.100
(but your crimes)

00:38:25.381 --> 00:38:26.700
(must face judgment.)

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:39.381
Can I ask a favor?

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:41.541
I didn't make it to the sea.

00:38:42.941 --> 00:38:43.821
My parents...

00:39:19.541 --> 00:39:20.341
Tired?

00:39:21.421 --> 00:39:22.220
No.

00:39:22.901 --> 00:39:24.381
Let me drive. You can take a break.

00:39:25.381 --> 00:39:26.180
It's fine.

00:39:28.541 --> 00:39:30.461
Why'd you say yes to He Changchun?

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:32.901
Didn't think much about it.

00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:36.220
Just hoped it might

00:39:36.981 --> 00:39:38.100
plant some kindness in him.

00:39:43.901 --> 00:39:45.821
Have you contacted
your parents recently?

00:39:49.981 --> 00:39:51.821
Filial piety
is the foundation of all virtues.

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:55.341
Call them more often, just to check in.

00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:58.461
Okay.

00:40:00.421 --> 00:40:01.140
Master,

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:04.341
I have a classmate in the States.

00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:06.580
I heard they've developed a new drug

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:07.780
for Alzheimer's.

00:40:08.341 --> 00:40:09.541
If you ever need it,

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:10.901
I'll have it brought for you.

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:12.780
Quite expensive, right?

00:40:14.381 --> 00:40:16.021
No. It's on me.

00:40:19.461 --> 00:40:20.501
How dutiful.

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:45.901
In the end,
we're all just a handful of ashes.

00:40:46.941 --> 00:40:48.140
Scattered by the wind.

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:50.780
Cast into the sea,

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:52.220
without a trace left behind.

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.700
Why be so stubborn while alive?

00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:59.981
We all meet the same end.

00:41:01.341 --> 00:41:02.021
Master.

00:41:03.941 --> 00:41:05.300
Why make me your apprentice?

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:09.021
Then why did you become a cop?

00:41:14.341 --> 00:41:15.660
I know you can't let it go.

00:41:16.501 --> 00:41:18.021
And I'm not asking you to.

00:41:19.061 --> 00:41:20.140
You're still young.

00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:21.260
Life ahead is long.

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:23.421
Don't trap yourself.

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:33.421
Master.

00:41:36.088 --> 00:41:37.700
Spend more time with Xiaoyu
when you can.

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:39.021
When he's around,

00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:41.780
you're genuinely happy.

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:45.941
A father's faults

00:41:45.941 --> 00:41:48.861
are as numerous as the stars.

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:51.021
But his virtues?

00:41:51.381 --> 00:41:52.700
Like the sun.

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:54.620
When it rises,

00:41:54.901 --> 00:41:57.180
the stars all vanish.
