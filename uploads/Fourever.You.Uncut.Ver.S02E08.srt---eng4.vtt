00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.050
Phoon, do you want to move in with me?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.973
You won’t get bored of me, right, P'Fah?

00:00:15.071 --> 00:00:16.011
No way.

00:00:16.084 --> 00:00:18.250
Do you want to see your mom?

00:00:18.737 --> 00:00:20.988
You said you’d take me anywhere I want to go.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.114
I already know where I want to go.

00:00:23.688 --> 00:00:25.591
P'Fah, can we head back now?

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.968
- Why?
- I didn’t think it would be this cold.

00:00:29.306 --> 00:00:30.720
Help me find Phoon's mom.

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:32.487
His real mom. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:00:32.717 --> 00:00:34.712
Could you stop interfering with Phoon's life?

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:36.654
He has endured enough already.

00:00:36.902 --> 00:00:38.294
Please let him go.

00:00:42.714 --> 00:00:45.053
Thank you, P'Fah, for helping me find my mom.

00:00:48.567 --> 00:00:49.677
It’s nothing.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.802
Half Japanese.

00:00:59.253 --> 00:01:03.522
She has one son and is now 39 years old.

00:01:04.922 --> 00:01:08.837
Then she must have had me at 19.

00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:13.774
P'Fah.

00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:15.417
Yes?

00:01:15.798 --> 00:01:17.789
She must not have been ready when she had me.

00:01:21.494 --> 00:01:23.162
Ready or not, I don’t know.

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:26.554
But she sent you gifts every year, didn’t she?

00:01:28.045 --> 00:01:29.312
Besides,

00:01:30.262 --> 00:01:32.383
Your name and your mom’s in Japanese,

00:01:33.728 --> 00:01:35.592
they both mean flowers.

00:01:37.127 --> 00:01:38.351
How so?

00:01:39.888 --> 00:01:40.865
Yuri.

00:01:41.241 --> 00:01:42.481
It means lily.

00:01:43.115 --> 00:01:44.739
And Ren means lotus.

00:01:52.717 --> 00:01:54.336
Do you want to see your mom?

00:01:57.345 --> 00:01:58.342
I’m not sure.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.154
She already has a new family.

00:02:01.678 --> 00:02:03.417
If I go see her, I’m afraid

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.368
I might ruin the new life she’s built.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.994
Then why don’t you try contacting her first?

00:02:14.072 --> 00:02:17.222
If she seems uncomfortable, you can step back.

00:02:21.247 --> 00:02:23.305
Did I make you feel uneasy?

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:25.835
You don’t have to overthink it.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.373
If you don’t want to go, it’s okay.

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:33.194
Actually,

00:02:34.371 --> 00:02:35.979
I do want to see her at least once.

00:02:47.457 --> 00:02:48.917
Her son’s name is Daiki.

00:02:50.143 --> 00:02:51.460
I’m going to have a younger sibling.

00:02:52.557 --> 00:02:53.585
That’s cute.

00:04:32.598 --> 00:04:34.242
Maew, are you mixed?

00:04:35.623 --> 00:04:36.680
Not exactly.

00:04:38.536 --> 00:04:40.614
My mom is mixed.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.841
Oh, so you’re 25% Japanese?

00:04:46.788 --> 00:04:49.630
You get half from your mom, right?

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:52.376
So?

00:04:53.022 --> 00:04:54.397
Are you going to see her?

00:04:56.155 --> 00:04:57.241
I don’t know.

00:04:57.795 --> 00:04:59.245
My mom already has a new family.

00:05:00.051 --> 00:05:01.460
I don’t know

00:05:02.143 --> 00:05:03.700
if I should go or not.

00:05:06.994 --> 00:05:08.167
I think you should.

00:05:08.955 --> 00:05:10.611
She probably misses you a lot.

00:05:11.161 --> 00:05:13.223
Otherwise, why would she send gifts?

00:05:13.367 --> 00:05:14.442
Yeah, true.

00:05:16.146 --> 00:05:17.477
Why don’t you try contacting her first?

00:05:18.771 --> 00:05:19.922
Like sending a letter.

00:05:24.549 --> 00:05:25.031
Well,

00:05:25.777 --> 00:05:26.660
that could work.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.632
I’ll write her a letter first.

00:05:28.811 --> 00:05:30.484
If she doesn’t reply, I’ll deal with it then.

00:05:31.352 --> 00:05:32.933
She will reply.

00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:36.527
Anyway, congratulations.

00:05:37.053 --> 00:05:40.465
You finally know who your mom is.

00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:41.826
Yeah.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.764
What about your dad?

00:05:51.902 --> 00:05:53.355
That’s probably over now.

00:05:54.074 --> 00:05:55.792
He’s already paid for what he did.

00:05:56.573 --> 00:05:58.118
I’ll live my own life.

00:05:58.844 --> 00:06:00.927
Living separately like this is fine.

00:06:06.721 --> 00:06:08.262
I’m really proud of you.

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:12.617
You’ve grown so much. You’ve really matured.

00:06:12.948 --> 00:06:16.274
- You used to cry whenever your dad came up.
- True.

00:06:16.663 --> 00:06:20.585
- You did great.
- Whenever he talked about his dad, his face was like a cat that ate poop.

00:06:23.816 --> 00:06:25.108
What’s wrong with you?

00:06:27.814 --> 00:06:28.951
Serves you right.

00:06:29.327 --> 00:06:30.327
There you go again.

00:06:30.733 --> 00:06:31.617
Thanks.

00:06:33.088 --> 00:06:34.721
When I was at my worst,

00:06:34.885 --> 00:06:35.939
you guys were the only ones

00:06:36.426 --> 00:06:37.448
who made things better.

00:06:40.905 --> 00:06:42.395
I’m an unlucky guy.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.038
I used up all my luck

00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:47.299
on meeting good friends like you guys.

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:56.005
- Maew, stop it, he’s about to cry.
- I’m not crying. You are. Don’t push it.

00:06:56.315 --> 00:06:58.314
You’re sniffling.

00:06:58.994 --> 00:07:01.442
Maew, honestly, it’s nothing.

00:07:01.783 --> 00:07:03.414
You don’t have to thank us.

00:07:04.437 --> 00:07:05.896
Just pay for our drinks instead.

00:07:09.321 --> 00:07:11.022
Seriously.

00:07:11.324 --> 00:07:14.928
You have zero common sense and can’t read the room.

00:07:17.065 --> 00:07:19.025
I just don’t like this kind of mood.

00:07:19.225 --> 00:07:20.379
It’s too tense.

00:07:25.515 --> 00:07:26.727
Hey.

00:07:29.954 --> 00:07:30.866
Thanks.

00:07:32.811 --> 00:07:33.554
What are you saying?

00:07:35.675 --> 00:07:38.257
Thanks for helping me with everything.

00:07:38.648 --> 00:07:40.401
And when Phoon got into trouble, too.

00:07:41.222 --> 00:07:42.194
Do you even realize?

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.980
- You’re like the group’s hero.
- Hero, my ass.

00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:50.390
- Are you crazy, thanking me out of nowhere?
- North’s blushing.

00:07:50.837 --> 00:07:52.143
I’m serious.

00:07:53.216 --> 00:07:55.080
I’m really glad to have a friend like you.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.549
Having a friend like you in this life

00:08:00.096 --> 00:08:01.656
is better than winning the lottery.

00:08:05.247 --> 00:08:06.225
I really love you.

00:08:07.268 --> 00:08:09.555
Hey, what kind of love talk is that?

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:12.712
Are you crazy, Ter? What are you saying?

00:08:12.771 --> 00:08:15.524
- No way.
- Acting cool, but you’re blushed, right?

00:08:16.097 --> 00:08:18.851
- No, I’m not.
- You are blushed.

00:08:18.902 --> 00:08:20.733
- I can tell.
- Are you nuts? Enough.

00:08:20.783 --> 00:08:24.349
There are tons of people here. What are you doing?

00:08:25.696 --> 00:08:26.930
But really,

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:30.349
I’m really happy

00:08:30.681 --> 00:08:31.722
to have you as my friend.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.641
Do you know you’ve always been positive energy for us?

00:08:42.677 --> 00:08:43.591
Love you, man.

00:08:44.044 --> 00:08:46.048
Hey, stop with the love stuff. No.

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:49.103
- Say you love us.
- What love nonsense again?

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:52.251
- I was getting emotional just now.
- Emotional about what?

00:08:52.487 --> 00:08:55.305
- Hurry up.
- Ter, behave yourself.

00:08:55.794 --> 00:08:56.755
Are you crazy?

00:08:57.955 --> 00:08:58.703
He's just shy.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.460
Three people are done.

00:09:09.897 --> 00:09:12.706
No, I’m not saying it.

00:09:12.921 --> 00:09:13.602
Hey.

00:09:20.931 --> 00:09:24.063
- Thanks, Dao.
- Thanks so much, Dao.

00:09:24.235 --> 00:09:26.256
Dao gives really good advice.

00:09:26.337 --> 00:09:29.059
- If we don't have you.
- Seriously, the group would’ve fallen apart.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.435
We’d be screwed without Dao.

00:09:31.465 --> 00:09:33.093
I’m really glad.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.087
Even though you never eat with us.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.143
To Ms. Nakamura Yuri.

00:09:55.093 --> 00:09:57.324
Hello, my name is Typhoon.

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:01.642
I am your son. May I call you Mom?

00:10:02.124 --> 00:10:06.371
I don’t know if it’s okay to write to you.

00:10:07.272 --> 00:10:12.722
But I want you to know how happy I am to know who my real mom is.

00:10:12.986 --> 00:10:18.102
I only recently found out that someone sent me birthday gifts every year.

00:10:19.365 --> 00:10:24.454
If it was you, I’m happy you still think of me.

00:10:38.164 --> 00:10:41.349
I’m not angry that you weren’t with me.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:47.619
No matter the reason, I just hope you’re doing well.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:30.600
As for me, I’m doing well.

00:11:31.315 --> 00:11:34.453
I’ve met someone I love, and who loves me.

00:11:37.368 --> 00:11:38.499
Thank you.

00:11:38.696 --> 00:11:40.720
Can I hire you to dress me for life?

00:11:40.971 --> 00:11:43.518
Sure, but

00:11:43.934 --> 00:11:44.985
there’s a small fee.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.634
Is it expensive?

00:11:49.546 --> 00:11:51.954
Not at all. Just...

00:11:52.983 --> 00:11:53.737
one kiss.

00:11:58.678 --> 00:12:00.700
What are you saying?

00:12:01.709 --> 00:12:03.168
You’ve gotten really cute lately.

00:12:04.512 --> 00:12:07.074
Whenever I talk like that, you get shy.

00:12:08.463 --> 00:12:09.585
You’re cute, P'Fah.

00:12:11.838 --> 00:12:13.177
Stop it.

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:21.250
I have friends and good people around me.

00:12:22.882 --> 00:12:23.761
Hey.

00:12:37.266 --> 00:12:38.442
Faculty of Fine Arts.

00:12:49.131 --> 00:12:51.930
I’ve found my purpose and goals in life.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:56.835
If one day you ever wonder whether I’m doing well,

00:12:57.284 --> 00:12:59.711
I’m doing fine. Don’t worry.

00:13:00.882 --> 00:13:01.896
Do you best, Phoon.

00:13:03.262 --> 00:13:03.967
Ok.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.829
I want to see you, Mom.

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:27.084
But if you don’t want to see me, that’s okay. I understand.

00:13:27.401 --> 00:13:33.385
I wish you happiness and smiles every day. From Typhoon.

00:13:33.866 --> 00:13:34.579
Ren.

00:14:14.548 --> 00:14:15.269
Is there any?

00:14:16.315 --> 00:14:17.183
Just a moment.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.900
Maybe she doesn’t want to see me.

00:14:38.749 --> 00:14:40.225
That’s why she hasn’t replied.

00:14:43.857 --> 00:14:45.250
Don’t jump to conclusions.

00:14:55.002 --> 00:14:56.774
What are you going to do next?

00:14:57.328 --> 00:14:58.985
I will probably look for work.

00:14:59.162 --> 00:15:01.530
Start a new life with Fai, just the two of us.

00:15:03.377 --> 00:15:04.650
That must be tough.

00:15:05.248 --> 00:15:08.494
At least I’ll have peace of mind knowing no one will hurt us again.

00:15:09.194 --> 00:15:10.410
You too, Phoon.

00:15:10.638 --> 00:15:12.373
Live your life happily.

00:15:12.702 --> 00:15:14.986
I’ll bring Fai to visit often.

00:15:16.004 --> 00:15:16.551
Okay.

00:15:16.945 --> 00:15:18.896
Please take good care of yourself, Aunt Phrae.

00:15:41.536 --> 00:15:42.317
You’re back?

00:16:24.644 --> 00:16:27.287
Ren, I’m sorry. I miss you. I’ll wait.
From Mom

00:16:31.248 --> 00:16:32.328
That’s wonderful.

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:37.761
Yeah.

00:16:47.734 --> 00:16:49.554
Enjoy your sweets.

00:16:56.551 --> 00:16:58.419
What does it mean?

00:17:00.235 --> 00:17:02.687
It means “Enjoy your sweets.”

00:17:17.419 --> 00:17:18.518
I will

00:17:19.031 --> 00:17:20.367
take you to see your mom.

00:17:23.008 --> 00:17:24.242
You're so kind.

00:17:24.948 --> 00:17:26.983
Hmm? Me?

00:17:28.016 --> 00:17:28.555
Yes.

00:17:29.785 --> 00:17:31.653
You must get complimented a lot, huh?

00:17:33.677 --> 00:17:34.914
Not really.

00:17:35.362 --> 00:17:37.072
With other people, it’s just normal.

00:17:37.899 --> 00:17:38.872
But with you…

00:17:41.605 --> 00:17:43.680
I can really do anything for you.

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:51.797
I can’t wait to see what the dessert looks like.

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:54.266
How to open it?

00:17:55.333 --> 00:17:56.019
Here you go.

00:18:05.706 --> 00:18:08.050
This is called Manju.

00:18:15.001 --> 00:18:16.228
Do you want to try it, P'Fah?

00:18:16.709 --> 00:18:17.672
You try it first, Phoon.

00:18:30.391 --> 00:18:31.522
Here.

00:18:31.591 --> 00:18:32.696
My mom sent it for me.

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:37.765
Wow, you’re all smiles just thinking about seeing your mama.

00:18:38.619 --> 00:18:40.008
Let him smile for once.

00:18:40.539 --> 00:18:42.924
- True.
- Sure.

00:18:43.031 --> 00:18:44.355
Congrats, Maew.

00:18:44.595 --> 00:18:45.256
Mm.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.631
So where are you meeting your mama?

00:18:49.022 --> 00:18:51.896
She sent me the address. We’ll meet there.

00:18:52.085 --> 00:18:54.291
There? Japan?

00:18:54.589 --> 00:18:55.162
Yeah.

00:18:55.717 --> 00:18:57.269
Whoa.

00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:01.635
So that means you and P'Fah get to go on another date in Japan, right?

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:03.663
- Hey!
- No, no!

00:19:03.783 --> 00:19:07.028
Hey, Ter, stop teasing him. Look at that smile—his cheeks must hurt already.

00:19:07.779 --> 00:19:09.826
Awww, so much shy, huh.

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.322
I'm just happy. What’s wrong with that?

00:19:16.591 --> 00:19:18.949
- Here, take some sweets.
- Thanks.

00:19:18.955 --> 00:19:20.503
Handing out snacks!

00:19:20.527 --> 00:19:21.949
- I’ll give you two.
- Thanks a lot.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.348
- Here.
- Hey, why do I only get one? Can I have two?

00:19:25.355 --> 00:19:27.242
- He eats a lot.
- Why?.

00:19:27.324 --> 00:19:30.570
- You're not handsome enough to get two.
- Then it should be you who get just one.

00:19:31.103 --> 00:19:32.094
- Hey!
- Too slow.

00:19:32.825 --> 00:19:34.118
Speed belongs to the devil—don’t compete with me.

00:19:34.197 --> 00:19:35.663
You steal my stuff all the time.

00:19:36.648 --> 00:19:37.954
You didn’t even split the bill last time.

00:19:38.528 --> 00:19:39.662
Look at you, pretending to be sulky.

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.485
- Here, kids.
- Thank you.

00:19:47.823 --> 00:19:49.200
Thank you.

00:19:54.173 --> 00:19:55.032
Oh, P'Gib.

00:19:57.758 --> 00:19:58.860
My mom sent these.

00:19:59.287 --> 00:20:01.302
Whoa.

00:20:03.417 --> 00:20:04.853
- Wow.
- Would you like to try some?

00:20:05.617 --> 00:20:07.115
Thank you, Phoon.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:12.773
Ever since you started dating Doctor Fah, you’re glowing.

00:20:14.383 --> 00:20:16.030
That’s what love does.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.260
Not just that.

00:20:17.472 --> 00:20:20.710
- He's even going on a honeymoon in Japan.
- What honeymoon?

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:22.037
You’re exaggerating, North.

00:20:22.051 --> 00:20:23.878
Don’t tell me you’ve already packed your bags.

00:20:24.001 --> 00:20:25.708
You’ve already planned it, right?

00:20:25.844 --> 00:20:29.731
Come on. Are you planning to introduce him to your mom too?

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:33.613
He must be trying outfits from day one to the last day.

00:20:34.217 --> 00:20:37.260
- The sweets are really good. Try them.
- Hey, are you changing the subject?

00:20:49.282 --> 00:20:50.408
Which one should I get?

00:20:53.751 --> 00:20:55.362
What do you think, P'Fah?

00:20:59.109 --> 00:21:00.440
Both of them.

00:21:03.477 --> 00:21:05.102
One is enough.

00:21:06.234 --> 00:21:08.829
Why? I’ll buy it for you.

00:21:10.048 --> 00:21:10.454
Hm?

00:21:13.509 --> 00:21:16.096
Then, is there any other one you want to see, Phoon?

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:17.432
Um…

00:21:18.814 --> 00:21:19.620
No.

00:21:32.491 --> 00:21:33.571
Should I buy a new camera?

00:21:35.828 --> 00:21:36.657
Sure.

00:21:40.001 --> 00:21:41.284
P'Fah, you should stop me sometimes.

00:21:41.823 --> 00:21:42.835
You spoil me completely.

00:21:43.005 --> 00:21:46.128
I like seeing you happy.

00:21:49.908 --> 00:21:52.976
Now I understand Jo and Hill.

00:21:53.592 --> 00:21:57.478
When you have a boyfriend, you just want to indulge him.

00:22:02.269 --> 00:22:03.219
You’re not buying it?

00:22:06.368 --> 00:22:07.800
Thinking about it…

00:22:07.964 --> 00:22:09.322
I already have a lot of cameras.

00:22:10.521 --> 00:22:12.690
I’d rather save the money to visit my mom in Japan.

00:23:02.517 --> 00:23:04.333
Are you excited about seeing your mom?

00:23:05.699 --> 00:23:06.542
I am.

00:23:07.145 --> 00:23:08.949
I never thought I’d really get to see her.

00:23:10.088 --> 00:23:13.912
At first, I thought she didn’t want to see me anymore.

00:23:15.497 --> 00:23:16.838
Why would you think that?

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.509
I don’t know.

00:23:21.594 --> 00:23:24.517
Maybe I’m just not used to being happy.

00:23:30.157 --> 00:23:31.570
Don’t think like that.

00:23:33.164 --> 00:23:37.241
You deserve happiness more than anyone. You know that, right?

00:23:40.201 --> 00:23:41.493
Thank you.

00:24:12.389 --> 00:24:13.293
Are you excited?

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:15.837
Yes.

00:24:17.139 --> 00:24:18.435
Very excited.

00:24:25.385 --> 00:24:27.063
Do you think it’ll be okay?

00:24:28.482 --> 00:24:29.688
It’ll definitely be okay.

00:24:30.657 --> 00:24:31.674
Trust me.

00:24:49.497 --> 00:24:50.125
Ren.

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:57.668
Mom.

00:25:06.625 --> 00:25:08.764
You’ve grown so much.

00:25:15.167 --> 00:25:16.552
I came to see you.

00:25:23.257 --> 00:25:24.915
Let’s go inside first.

00:25:42.352 --> 00:25:44.727
Your name is Tonfah, right?

00:25:45.739 --> 00:25:46.825
Yes.

00:25:47.121 --> 00:25:49.937
The one who called me.

00:25:52.696 --> 00:25:53.634
Yes.

00:25:54.091 --> 00:25:54.831
Well…

00:25:55.663 --> 00:25:57.251
Phoon really wanted to see you.

00:25:58.137 --> 00:25:59.731
So I helped look for you until I found you.

00:26:02.034 --> 00:26:07.201
Thank you for bringing my son to see me.

00:26:29.845 --> 00:26:30.628
I'm...

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:33.682
I’m really sorry.

00:26:36.044 --> 00:26:38.645
Mama loves you.

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:43.297
Mama missed you so much.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:48.054
I missed you too.

00:26:49.925 --> 00:26:51.075
I’ve always wanted to see you.

00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:28.007
Hello. Nice to meet you.

00:27:28.373 --> 00:27:29.662
I’m P'Tonfah.

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.779
Hello. Nice to meet you.

00:27:31.967 --> 00:27:33.045
I’m Daiki.

00:27:35.168 --> 00:27:36.060
Daiki.

00:27:37.808 --> 00:27:39.968
- Tonfah.
- You're so cute.

00:27:40.438 --> 00:27:41.081
Thank you.

00:27:42.337 --> 00:27:50.675
The first time I went to Phuket was to bring my mother’s ashes back to her hometown.

00:27:51.253 --> 00:27:54.054
That’s when I met him.

00:27:56.401 --> 00:27:58.314
So my grand-mother was from Phuket.

00:27:59.367 --> 00:28:00.407
He…

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:02.463
told me

00:28:03.482 --> 00:28:04.908
that he had no family.

00:28:06.813 --> 00:28:08.115
And I believed him.

00:28:10.654 --> 00:28:11.811
Until I got pregnant.

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.136
It’s okay.

00:28:18.699 --> 00:28:19.477
Please go on.

00:28:19.974 --> 00:28:22.653
He told me to get an abortion.

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:25.991
But I couldn’t do it.

00:28:26.348 --> 00:28:30.391
I wanted to raise my child as best as I could.

00:28:31.182 --> 00:28:33.728
But it wasn’t easy.

00:28:35.161 --> 00:28:37.013
I couldn’t bear seeing you starve.

00:28:37.404 --> 00:28:40.527
So I took you to ask him for help.

00:28:41.943 --> 00:28:44.560
His wife was furious.

00:28:44.795 --> 00:28:46.631
But she felt sorry for you.

00:28:47.059 --> 00:28:49.025
So she agreed to raise you.

00:28:49.468 --> 00:28:54.121
On the condition that I never interfered with their family again.

00:29:04.364 --> 00:29:08.315
She must have been hurt just as much.

00:29:10.912 --> 00:29:15.877
We were both hurt by the same man.

00:29:23.139 --> 00:29:24.454
I thought

00:29:25.016 --> 00:29:31.697
it was better for you. I secretly came to see you many times, but I never dared to approach.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.924
All I could do was send gifts.

00:29:35.924 --> 00:29:38.690
I’m sorry. This is my fault.

00:29:41.259 --> 00:29:44.780
I’m not here to decide who’s right or wrong.

00:29:46.256 --> 00:29:47.484
I don’t resent anyone.

00:29:48.232 --> 00:29:49.299
I don’t blame anyone.

00:29:50.407 --> 00:29:51.540
That’s all in the past.

00:29:53.284 --> 00:29:57.394
Please don’t feel guilty anymore.

00:29:59.857 --> 00:30:01.004
At first,

00:30:01.614 --> 00:30:04.281
Mama named you Ren.

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.557
But they changed your name, didn’t they?

00:30:11.672 --> 00:30:14.170
Why did you name me Ren?

00:30:14.712 --> 00:30:15.669
Ren

00:30:16.013 --> 00:30:18.244
means a lotus.

00:30:20.222 --> 00:30:25.797
A lotus that is already beautiful when it’s in the right place.

00:30:38.989 --> 00:30:39.767
Daiki.

00:30:43.322 --> 00:30:44.733
Go say hello to your big brother.

00:30:46.155 --> 00:30:48.028
Hello. Nice to meet you.

00:30:50.823 --> 00:30:52.065
He said 'My name is Daiki.

00:30:52.444 --> 00:30:53.401
Nice to meet you.'

00:30:55.677 --> 00:30:58.186
He’s wanted an older brother for a long time.

00:30:59.314 --> 00:31:02.478
He said he’s wanted an older brother for a long time.

00:31:03.131 --> 00:31:04.060
Really?

00:31:04.528 --> 00:31:07.285
I’ve always wanted a younger brother too.

00:31:07.862 --> 00:31:11.068
He said he’s wanted a younger brother too.

00:31:13.499 --> 00:31:14.398
Hello.

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:15.623
Hello.

00:31:36.053 --> 00:31:37.610
Thank you for letting me come see you.

00:31:39.002 --> 00:31:44.125
Why are you talking like we won’t see each other again?

00:31:45.063 --> 00:31:46.807
I just wanted you to see

00:31:47.394 --> 00:31:48.828
that I’m doing well.

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:51.640
This time,

00:31:52.663 --> 00:31:53.884
I just wanted to see

00:31:54.334 --> 00:31:55.894
that you’re doing well too.

00:32:02.085 --> 00:32:03.379
I want you to be happy

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:04.976
with the path you chose.

00:32:06.368 --> 00:32:07.528
As for me,

00:32:08.044 --> 00:32:10.351
I’ll be happy with the path I chose too.

00:32:12.555 --> 00:32:14.080
Even if we don’t live together,

00:32:15.887 --> 00:32:17.530
we still have each other, right?

00:32:20.525 --> 00:32:21.312
Mama.

00:32:22.192 --> 00:32:24.248
I can still be your mama, right?

00:32:30.026 --> 00:32:31.648
No matter what,

00:32:33.213 --> 00:32:34.862
I still want you to be my mama.

00:32:37.518 --> 00:32:38.296
And I

00:32:40.312 --> 00:32:41.380
will always be your Ren.

00:32:43.998 --> 00:32:47.354
We’ll get to see each other again, right?

00:32:50.448 --> 00:32:52.280
Come visit often, okay?

00:32:58.928 --> 00:33:00.525
I’ll come back to visit often.

00:33:02.626 --> 00:33:04.909
He said he’ll come back to visit again.

00:33:09.174 --> 00:33:10.259
Goodbye.

00:33:11.017 --> 00:33:11.653
Goodbye.

00:33:14.468 --> 00:33:18.201
Please take care of your health.

00:33:19.183 --> 00:33:19.977
I will.

00:33:22.743 --> 00:33:23.731
Goodbye.

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:32.740
Thank you.

00:33:33.299 --> 00:33:36.202
Please take good care of Ren.

00:33:38.034 --> 00:33:45.154
I’ll take care of and protect your son with my life.

00:33:47.585 --> 00:33:48.543
Thank you.

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:49.299
Thank you.

00:34:08.561 --> 00:34:09.724
You're really kind.

00:34:13.231 --> 00:34:14.242
Yes, you are.

00:34:14.425 --> 00:34:15.988
You're incredibly kind.

00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:20.448
Not many people would be happy when their parents remarry.

00:34:21.068 --> 00:34:23.385
And on top of that, you love you half-brother like this.

00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:27.678
Well, Daiki is adorable.

00:34:35.133 --> 00:34:39.069
I think you and your mom are really alike.

00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:40.783
How so?

00:34:43.441 --> 00:34:45.343
Probably you guys faces look similar.

00:34:46.232 --> 00:34:47.620
Especially the eyes.

00:34:53.768 --> 00:34:59.951
Thank you for giving him such a beautiful and radiant smile.

00:35:00.555 --> 00:35:06.773
He’s beautiful and radiant on his own.

00:35:08.817 --> 00:35:18.360
Because of the path you chose twenty years ago, I’ve had him to love until today.

00:35:19.146 --> 00:35:22.010
Thank you so much.

00:35:45.482 --> 00:35:46.342
How's going?

00:35:47.284 --> 00:35:48.008
How are things?

00:35:48.648 --> 00:35:49.471
Well…

00:35:49.856 --> 00:35:50.617
It’s cold.

00:35:52.626 --> 00:35:54.228
Where’s P'Fah?

00:35:54.847 --> 00:35:56.525
He looked tired, so he fell asleep.

00:35:57.075 --> 00:35:59.022
So I came out for a walk in the garden.

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:02.927
Morning, little one.

00:36:03.041 --> 00:36:04.386
Why did you get out of bed?

00:36:07.133 --> 00:36:07.760
Uh…

00:36:09.405 --> 00:36:10.173
Whoa.

00:36:14.601 --> 00:36:15.694
Why are you calling?

00:36:17.718 --> 00:36:18.880
He wanted to talk to Phoon.

00:36:19.456 --> 00:36:20.168
Oh?

00:36:21.056 --> 00:36:21.795
I’ll hang up now.

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:37.105
Are you okay, Phoon?

00:36:38.277 --> 00:36:40.077
P'Fah, it’s just that…

00:36:40.712 --> 00:36:41.620
Earlier…

00:36:43.037 --> 00:36:43.958
What is it?

00:36:44.325 --> 00:36:46.140
Everyone saw it already.

00:36:46.731 --> 00:36:48.029
The morning kiss?

00:36:48.896 --> 00:36:49.878
It’s okay.

00:36:50.204 --> 00:36:51.425
Don’t overthink it, Phoon.

00:36:51.909 --> 00:36:53.534
How can it be okay?

00:36:58.151 --> 00:36:59.014
Are you upset?

00:36:59.389 --> 00:36:59.986
Yes. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:37:00.949 --> 00:37:02.321
Very upset.

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:10.921
- What are you doing?
- Making it up to you.

00:37:11.648 --> 00:37:13.302
Who makes up like this?

00:37:13.712 --> 00:37:14.841
I do.

00:37:15.343 --> 00:37:17.094
Who told you to get out of bed?

00:37:17.312 --> 00:37:18.534
You looked tired.

00:37:18.962 --> 00:37:21.499
So I didn’t want to disturb you.

00:37:25.244 --> 00:37:25.672
Okay.

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:29.306
Okay?

00:37:30.902 --> 00:37:33.451
I understand now.

00:37:33.894 --> 00:37:35.663
But you can’t tease mr like that.

00:37:37.281 --> 00:37:39.122
I wasn’t teasing you.

00:37:39.712 --> 00:37:41.474
I really didn’t see it.

00:37:42.977 --> 00:37:44.807
- Really?
- Really.

00:37:45.155 --> 00:37:47.117
I never tease you.

00:37:47.645 --> 00:37:49.425
You tease me the most.

00:37:50.048 --> 00:37:50.838
Hey.

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:52.365
Then…

00:37:52.905 --> 00:37:54.534
Let’s not count what just happened.

00:37:54.801 --> 00:37:57.737
I think we need a proper round.

00:37:59.754 --> 00:38:01.019
A proper round?

00:38:01.856 --> 00:38:02.558
Well…

00:38:02.949 --> 00:38:04.605
A real morning kiss.

00:38:05.457 --> 00:38:06.508
That’s not it.

00:38:06.925 --> 00:38:07.942
Right?

00:38:08.202 --> 00:38:09.568
Just one morning kiss.

00:38:23.075 --> 00:38:24.525
Good morning again.

00:38:26.188 --> 00:38:28.248
Good morning.

00:39:06.835 --> 00:39:08.721
I heard from Ter that today’s Phoon's birthday?

00:39:09.426 --> 00:39:09.997
Yeah.

00:39:11.228 --> 00:39:12.434
I sent my gift with Ter.

00:39:13.014 --> 00:39:13.954
Thanks, man.

00:39:14.367 --> 00:39:16.520
Every birthday gives me a headache.

00:39:16.657 --> 00:39:18.093
I never know what to buy.

00:39:18.254 --> 00:39:19.469
I let North choose, I’ll pay for it.

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:22.645
That’s so you, Jo.

00:39:23.392 --> 00:39:24.577
Hey, buy one for me too.

00:39:24.922 --> 00:39:27.762
- Go ask your Papa.
- Hey, watch your mouth.

00:39:28.644 --> 00:39:30.825
Hi, Papa.

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:33.906
So what did you buy for him?

00:40:02.069 --> 00:40:04.666
Happy Birthday, my little one.

00:40:04.896 --> 00:40:07.788
May every day from now on be a good day for you.

00:40:08.324 --> 00:40:11.404
May all your wishes come true.

00:40:11.854 --> 00:40:14.182
P'Fah will always be cheering you on.

00:40:41.798 --> 00:40:42.813
Thank you.

00:40:47.533 --> 00:40:48.367
A camera?

00:40:49.074 --> 00:40:49.628
How much?

00:40:50.668 --> 00:40:51.568
Just over a hundred thousand.

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:52.949
What?!

00:40:54.536 --> 00:40:56.210
So you’re one of those people too now?

00:40:56.231 --> 00:41:00.090
Fah, once you have a boyfriend, you love like crazy, huh?

00:41:00.194 --> 00:41:01.882
- You don’t have one.
- Hey.

00:41:01.933 --> 00:41:04.536
- Watch your mouth.
- Better that way.

00:41:04.841 --> 00:41:06.471
- I pity for his boyfriend.
- Wow.

00:41:07.259 --> 00:41:09.887
You guys are such jerks.

00:41:11.665 --> 00:41:13.080
Is Arthit sulking?

00:41:15.998 --> 00:41:19.011
Wow, P'Fah bought a camera as a gift?

00:41:19.272 --> 00:41:20.291
Yeah.

00:41:20.362 --> 00:41:24.345
That’s huge. My gift and Jo’s look so little now.

00:41:26.817 --> 00:41:27.640
What gift of yours?

00:41:28.435 --> 00:41:29.077
Here.

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.705
- From me and P'Hill.
- Thank you.

00:41:31.736 --> 00:41:32.908
You’re definitely going to like it.

00:41:33.931 --> 00:41:36.454
Just the fact that you guys remembered my birthday already makes me happy.

00:41:38.269 --> 00:41:40.285
If you’re really happy, then I’ll take it back.

00:41:40.311 --> 00:41:41.522
- No.
- What?

00:41:41.856 --> 00:41:42.558
Hey!

00:41:42.914 --> 00:41:43.920
You’re pulling so hard.

00:41:44.499 --> 00:41:45.882
Why did you have to be born today?

00:41:46.915 --> 00:41:48.122
I want to go celebrate too.

00:41:48.835 --> 00:41:51.194
Then cancel your family plans and come celebrate my birthday with me.

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:54.241
Oh, so if I get cut out of the inheritance,

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:55.468
are you going to take care of me?

00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:57.662
Nope.

00:41:58.965 --> 00:41:59.957
Ugh.

00:42:00.586 --> 00:42:02.656
Let’s check out the birthday gifts and see what I got.

00:42:02.983 --> 00:42:03.751
Whose should we open first?

00:42:06.469 --> 00:42:09.785
Save mine for last. Start with the gloomy-looking box first—it looks nicely depressing.

00:42:09.814 --> 00:42:11.697
- That’s bullying.
- It’s cool.

00:42:11.724 --> 00:42:14.477
Bullying. You’re exaggerating.

00:42:14.511 --> 00:42:16.185
It’s style, just look at it.

00:42:16.254 --> 00:42:17.808
Simple but classy.

00:42:18.013 --> 00:42:20.029
Or start from Dao's?

00:42:20.746 --> 00:42:21.891
Did you get me an amulet or what?

00:42:34.685 --> 00:42:35.720
Taking photos again?

00:42:37.208 --> 00:42:38.198
P'Fah, look.

00:42:39.322 --> 00:42:40.518
You look like a model.

00:42:43.222 --> 00:42:44.700
That’s because the photographer is good.

00:42:53.202 --> 00:42:54.685
Time really flies, doesn’t it?

00:42:56.413 --> 00:42:58.684
It feels like we were just here not long ago.

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:01.413
Yeah.

00:43:05.589 --> 00:43:06.650
Do you remember, P'Fah?

00:43:07.057 --> 00:43:08.392
You said that…

00:43:08.921 --> 00:43:12.069
"I can’t be the sky for anyone."

00:43:15.143 --> 00:43:16.081
I remember.

00:43:16.728 --> 00:43:18.188
Do you still feel that way now?

00:43:24.244 --> 00:43:25.490
If that’s what Phoon wants,

00:43:25.826 --> 00:43:27.278
I can be anything for you.

00:43:31.665 --> 00:43:32.865
Thank you for bringing me here.

00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:35.805
Thank you again.

00:43:36.847 --> 00:43:38.077
Thank you so much.

00:43:39.315 --> 00:43:41.385
Even though you have been so busy,

00:43:42.441 --> 00:43:44.217
you still made time to be with me on my birthday.

00:43:48.117 --> 00:43:49.952
I don’t really do much for you, P'Fah.

00:43:52.454 --> 00:43:53.940
Just being a good kid is enough, Phoon.

00:43:55.115 --> 00:43:56.223
I'm a good kid.

00:43:56.518 --> 00:43:59.352
- And not naughty.
- You are. A naughty cat.

00:43:59.542 --> 00:44:01.340
I’m not naughty. And I’m not a cat either.

00:44:02.225 --> 00:44:03.208
Why not?

00:44:03.548 --> 00:44:05.400
Even your friends call you maew.

00:44:12.007 --> 00:44:13.383
- Maew.
- Yes?

00:44:15.622 --> 00:44:17.887
See? You said you weren’t a cat.

00:44:18.253 --> 00:44:19.314
Then why did you answer?

00:44:22.628 --> 00:44:24.564
If I were a cat,

00:44:25.512 --> 00:44:28.127
and really had nine lives,

00:44:29.767 --> 00:44:30.857
I’d give them all to you, P'Fah.

00:44:31.075 --> 00:44:32.851
Hmm? All of them?

00:44:34.152 --> 00:44:35.121
All of them.

00:44:39.714 --> 00:44:40.882
I’ll put them right into your hands.

00:44:42.902 --> 00:44:43.848
Okay.

00:44:44.367 --> 00:44:46.207
Then I’ll gladly take them all.

00:44:53.794 --> 00:44:55.062
Happy birthday.

00:44:56.524 --> 00:44:59.430
Thank you for becoming the best thing in my life.

00:45:31.173 --> 00:45:33.191
Come on, cheers!

00:45:33.725 --> 00:45:34.797
Yeah.

00:45:37.703 --> 00:45:39.011
Thanks for coming, Dao.

00:45:40.017 --> 00:45:42.425
It’s Maew’s birthday—how could I not come?

00:45:43.567 --> 00:45:47.063
Yeah, if you don’t come to my birthday, we’ll see about that.

00:45:49.714 --> 00:45:50.816
You get sulky so easily.

00:46:04.208 --> 00:46:05.979
It’s empty—time for a refill.

00:46:06.997 --> 00:46:08.020
Straight up.

00:46:08.648 --> 00:46:09.720
Hey, Jo.

00:46:09.965 --> 00:46:11.149
Control your boyfriend.

00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:12.429
Hey, he’s having fun.

00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:14.949
- Right?
- I am.

00:46:18.974 --> 00:46:20.220
- North.
- What?

00:46:20.271 --> 00:46:21.380
Are you trying to get me drunk?

00:46:22.059 --> 00:46:23.552
No way.

00:46:24.222 --> 00:46:26.222
How are you this strong with alcohol?

00:46:26.586 --> 00:46:27.561
That’s impossible.

00:46:27.749 --> 00:46:29.597
Let’s settle this.

00:46:30.511 --> 00:46:31.482
Whoever gets drunk wins—

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:33.437
no, whoever gets drunk first loses.

00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:34.628
- Deal.
- Yeah.

00:46:35.296 --> 00:46:35.995
Let’s go.

00:46:36.149 --> 00:46:37.777
- Bring it on.
- Yeah, bring it.

00:46:37.816 --> 00:46:39.746
- Come on.
- Let’s go.

00:46:39.918 --> 00:46:43.854
Cheers. Bottoms up.

00:46:49.091 --> 00:46:50.967
I love P'Hill the most.

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:57.222
Throwing up doesn’t count—but if you pass out, you lose.

00:46:58.872 --> 00:46:59.903
Cheers.

00:47:08.650 --> 00:47:11.826
Yes! I won!

00:47:14.866 --> 00:47:15.761
Yes, little one.

00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:17.315
You won.

00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:21.496
Ugh.

00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:24.182
Why was I even born a refrigerator?

00:47:24.389 --> 00:47:26.271
If I can’t even chill chicken in it.

00:47:27.256 --> 00:47:28.434
So annoying.

00:47:41.931 --> 00:47:44.160
I’ll go get a towel to wipe you down, okay?

00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:47.554
No.

00:47:50.561 --> 00:47:53.374
- I’ll just go grab a towel for a second, Phoon.
- No.

00:47:54.395 --> 00:47:57.644
No matter how good a person you meet,

00:47:58.429 --> 00:48:00.189
don’t ever leave me behind, okay?

00:48:04.143 --> 00:48:05.595
What are you talking about, Phoon?

00:48:05.979 --> 00:48:07.379
I don’t know. I’m drunk.

00:48:22.139 --> 00:48:22.958
P’Mhor.

00:48:23.379 --> 00:48:24.502
P’Mhor Fah.

00:48:24.608 --> 00:48:25.204
Yes?

00:48:27.299 --> 00:48:28.450
Don’t let me find out, okay?

00:48:30.275 --> 00:48:31.192
Find out about what?

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:36.607
That you were secretly checking someone else out during class.

00:48:38.521 --> 00:48:39.272
Really?

00:48:44.379 --> 00:48:45.505
P’Fah, do you like kids?

00:48:46.789 --> 00:48:47.792
Kids?

00:48:49.742 --> 00:48:51.722
Yeah, I do.

00:48:52.404 --> 00:48:53.103
Why?

00:48:54.728 --> 00:48:56.758
I like kids too.

00:48:57.244 --> 00:48:58.970
I want to have children.

00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:00.654
A whole house full of them.

00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:07.211
But P’Fah probably won’t have time for the kids.

00:49:07.752 --> 00:49:09.829
They’d love me more than you anyway.

00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:15.183
I would be Papa.

00:49:15.662 --> 00:49:17.435
The Papa who understands the kids the most.

00:49:25.151 --> 00:49:26.888
Why aren’t you answering, P’Fah?

00:49:28.179 --> 00:49:28.911
Well…

00:49:29.438 --> 00:49:31.074
You didn’t really ask me anything, Phoon.

00:49:33.416 --> 00:49:36.309
Then what would P’Fah name our child?

00:49:37.592 --> 00:49:38.814
A name?

00:49:42.934 --> 00:49:44.361
What should it be?

00:49:46.445 --> 00:49:48.611
I don’t know. You can decide, Phoon.

00:49:49.902 --> 00:49:51.712
But P’Fah works really hard.

00:49:52.668 --> 00:49:56.835
Will P’Fah even have time for me and the kids?

00:49:59.822 --> 00:50:04.148
Don’t worry, Phoon. I’ll try my best to make time for you and the kids.

00:50:04.434 --> 00:50:08.562
Then P’Fah has to be a really sweet Papa to them.

00:50:09.337 --> 00:50:10.211
I will. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:50:10.592 --> 00:50:11.645
But right now,

00:50:12.693 --> 00:50:13.797
it’s already late.

00:50:14.242 --> 00:50:15.161
Let’s go to sleep, okay?

00:50:15.367 --> 00:50:17.798
No. I won’t sleep. I’m not sleepy.

00:50:17.884 --> 00:50:19.870
- But you’re drunk, Phoon.
- I’m not.

00:50:20.551 --> 00:50:22.263
Why is Papa arguing with me?

00:50:22.976 --> 00:50:23.714
Wait a second…

00:50:24.354 --> 00:50:25.616
"Papa"?

00:50:25.909 --> 00:50:27.505
Papa’s arguing with me.

00:50:28.725 --> 00:50:31.160
Phoon, don’t be naughty.

00:50:33.114 --> 00:50:36.557
Papa scolds me—do you scold the kids too?

00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:39.616
If they’re naughty, then I have to.

00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:41.050
No, don’t scold them.

00:50:41.457 --> 00:50:44.480
If Papa scolds the kids, I’ll take them and run away.

00:50:44.768 --> 00:50:46.019
I won’t let them see you.

00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:52.361
In that case…

00:50:53.524 --> 00:50:55.245
Mama, don’t be so mean to Papa, okay?

00:51:01.952 --> 00:51:04.285
Ow, it hurts here.

00:51:04.548 --> 00:51:05.767
It hurts here.

00:51:19.570 --> 00:51:21.220
It hurts here too.

00:51:33.937 --> 00:51:34.681
Good night.

00:51:47.709 --> 00:51:48.471
Here you go, Phoon.

00:51:49.005 --> 00:51:49.804
Careful, it’s hot.

00:52:03.293 --> 00:52:04.253
Do you have a headache?

00:52:06.321 --> 00:52:08.517
A little.

00:52:08.709 --> 00:52:09.666
Next time,

00:52:10.038 --> 00:52:11.677
don’t drink this much, okay?

00:52:15.848 --> 00:52:16.324
Mm.

00:52:17.426 --> 00:52:19.480
It’s good. Did you make this yourself, P’Fah?

00:52:19.912 --> 00:52:20.708
I did.

00:52:21.309 --> 00:52:22.213
If you like it,

00:52:22.408 --> 00:52:23.263
eat a lot, okay?

00:52:31.674 --> 00:52:32.456
Phoon.

00:52:33.931 --> 00:52:35.422
Do you remember what you said

00:52:35.816 --> 00:52:37.062
last night?

00:52:38.124 --> 00:52:39.245
Last night?

00:52:40.088 --> 00:52:41.062
Why?

00:52:42.302 --> 00:52:44.478
You talked about

00:52:45.394 --> 00:52:46.282
having kids.

00:52:50.637 --> 00:52:51.631
Kids?

00:52:51.893 --> 00:52:52.570
Yes.

00:52:53.543 --> 00:52:56.837
You asked, “Does P’Fah like kids?”

00:52:56.942 --> 00:52:58.896
"Does P’Fah want to have kids?"

00:53:02.078 --> 00:53:06.268
Oh… I must’ve been drunk last night.

00:53:06.537 --> 00:53:07.508
I was just rambling.

00:53:16.423 --> 00:53:18.226
I won’t drink anymore.

00:53:19.521 --> 00:53:20.600
Why not?

00:53:22.386 --> 00:53:26.122
I think you’re pretty cute when you’re drunk.

00:53:29.533 --> 00:53:33.182
But you just told me not to drink too much.

00:53:35.764 --> 00:53:36.737
That’s true.

00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:42.293
I mean, you can drink—but only when I’m with you.

00:53:51.355 --> 00:53:52.608
Eat a lot, okay?

00:53:53.162 --> 00:53:54.327
- Mama.
- Hmm?

00:53:58.217 --> 00:54:02.041
If you’re still hungry, Papa can make more for you.

00:54:07.613 --> 00:54:08.739
Daotok.

00:54:10.157 --> 00:54:15.162
If you keep staring at us like that, I’m gonna puke on you.

00:54:17.277 --> 00:54:18.440
Don’t talk about puking.

00:54:18.887 --> 00:54:22.834
Enough. Stop arguing and help me check the exam results.

00:54:22.986 --> 00:54:24.497
Come help me root for this.

00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:27.182
Get up.

00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:34.025
Exam Results Announcement

Teerapat Chaowakornkul

00:54:36.174 --> 00:54:36.906
Shit.

00:54:43.823 --> 00:54:44.937
It’s okay, man.

00:54:46.568 --> 00:54:48.540
If I don’t get in this year, I can try again next year.

00:54:51.285 --> 00:54:53.146
You got in—holy shit, you got in!

00:54:53.191 --> 00:54:56.137
Your name’s on it. Come take a look.

Thirasophon University announces the admission results for Program Choice No. 6
Teerapat Chaowakornkul

00:55:00.468 --> 00:55:01.875
- I got in!
- Yeah.

00:55:02.133 --> 00:55:04.957
Yes!

00:55:55.525 --> 00:55:59.952
The sky is never the same each day, but it’s still just as captivating.

00:56:23.066 --> 00:56:26.001
To Typhoon,

00:56:31.293 --> 00:56:34.832
Even though I’ve written countless letters,

00:56:37.168 --> 00:56:39.810
to so many people,

00:56:42.157 --> 00:56:46.011
this is probably the first time I’ve ever written one to myself.

00:57:28.428 --> 00:57:29.454
Thank you.

00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:47.600
Thank you for growing stronger,

00:57:50.007 --> 00:57:52.297
and for accepting your own pain.

00:57:59.934 --> 00:58:02.149
Thank you for finding yourself in the end.

00:58:03.622 --> 00:58:08.358
Thank you for daring to open your heart, and for meeting so many good people along the way.

00:58:08.474 --> 00:58:09.503
Hey, you.

00:58:09.786 --> 00:58:10.877
The classroom’s this way.

00:58:12.801 --> 00:58:13.946
Yeah, I’m in the faculty.

00:58:14.493 --> 00:58:17.274
What should we do? That Phoon still gets lost like always.

00:58:17.848 --> 00:58:19.345
Will he survive without us?

00:58:23.213 --> 00:58:26.591
Are classes over yet? I’ll come pick you up.

00:58:29.939 --> 00:58:31.222
No need.

00:58:32.831 --> 00:58:33.945
Why not?

00:58:37.770 --> 00:58:43.788
Thank you for believing in love, enough to realize just how deeply you’re capable of loving someone.

00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:52.312
- Where to next?
- Maybe go eat.

00:58:52.797 --> 00:58:53.280
What about you?

00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:54.499
No idea.

00:58:55.232 --> 00:58:55.979
I’m hungry too.

00:58:56.961 --> 00:58:57.893
But I don’t feel like eating with you.

00:58:58.509 --> 00:58:59.472
What’s wrong with you?

00:59:00.848 --> 00:59:02.010
Phoon won’t let me go pick him up.

00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:09.946
Or maybe he’s studying photography now and totally surrounded by people.

00:59:09.964 --> 00:59:11.361
- Yeah, probably.
- Like Hill said.

00:59:15.192 --> 00:59:18.367
Oh, poor you, P'Fah.

00:59:18.962 --> 00:59:20.571
Your life is so tragic.

00:59:21.288 --> 00:59:24.560
Don’t listen to those idiots too much.
You know Phoon loves you to death.

00:59:24.717 --> 00:59:25.321
I know.

00:59:25.737 --> 00:59:27.162
I don’t believe a word those two say anyway.

00:59:27.296 --> 00:59:29.170
Huh?

00:59:30.331 --> 00:59:32.382
- Hey, Jo, did you hear that?
- Yeah.

00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:34.241
- See you at P'Gib’s shop.
- What the hell?

00:59:34.256 --> 00:59:34.986
He’s getting bold these days.

00:59:35.777 --> 00:59:36.890
Smiling nonstop.

00:59:41.657 --> 00:59:42.562
Where’s Phoon?

00:59:45.614 --> 00:59:46.423
Here.

01:00:06.444 --> 01:00:10.253
If it’s not too much trouble, may I see you again?

01:00:10.946 --> 01:00:13.122
There’s something important I’d like to talk to you about.

01:00:14.407 --> 01:00:16.082
- Thank you.
- You’re welcome.

01:00:27.016 --> 01:00:28.266
What’s up, little one?

01:00:41.555 --> 01:00:42.558
Hello.

01:00:46.533 --> 01:00:47.373
Hello.

01:00:49.685 --> 01:00:51.462
Thank you for meeting me.

01:00:54.441 --> 01:00:56.134
Thank you for coming to see me as well.

01:00:59.546 --> 01:01:05.146
Have you ever wondered what you would’ve done if I had walked away back then?

01:01:08.805 --> 01:01:13.321
Like I said before, I’d go back to the same place—where we feel at ease.

01:01:13.685 --> 01:01:15.075
No matter how long it takes.

01:01:23.777 --> 01:01:25.989
No matter how long, you’d still wait?

01:01:28.223 --> 01:01:28.980
Yes.

01:01:34.997 --> 01:01:35.823
One year.

01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:37.783
That’s fine.

01:01:42.617 --> 01:01:43.662
Two years.

01:01:44.250 --> 01:01:45.032
That’s still fine.

01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:46.829
Five years.

01:01:47.654 --> 01:01:48.407
That’s fine too.

01:01:48.635 --> 01:01:49.730
Then ten years.

01:01:50.801 --> 01:01:52.841
Phoon, stop teasing me already.

01:01:56.419 --> 01:01:57.826
I’m going to start counting down.

01:01:58.432 --> 01:02:01.468
If you still don’t say anything, you’ll be punished.

01:02:02.823 --> 01:02:03.656
Ten.

01:02:04.311 --> 01:02:05.034
Nine.

01:02:05.663 --> 01:02:06.337
Eight.

01:02:07.082 --> 01:02:07.681
Seven.

01:02:08.565 --> 01:02:09.050
Six.

01:02:10.059 --> 01:02:10.909
Five.

01:02:11.666 --> 01:02:12.687
- Four.
- P'Fah.

01:02:12.733 --> 01:02:14.334
- P'Fah.
- Three.

01:02:14.364 --> 01:02:15.365
I just—

01:02:15.463 --> 01:02:16.706
