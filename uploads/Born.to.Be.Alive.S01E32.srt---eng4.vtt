[Born to Be Alive]

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.220
[Episode 32]

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.810
Keep a close eye

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:44.710
on this person.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.180
Okay, okay.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:50.210
Han,

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:51.930
report on your work.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.509
As an informant,

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:58.000
I can't do anything useful.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.560
I've really just become a security guard.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.620
I'm doing safety training every day.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.380
You haven't gotten into the mine yet?

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.250
It's tough.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.730
You guys haven't gotten in either.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.860
There are cameras everywhere inside.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.390
How am I supposed to get in?

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.930
Maybe I should pull out.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.280
Just leave that batch of goods for now.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.010
We're not short on them anyway.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.510
Talk later.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.590
Okay.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.650
Bye-bye.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.050
You can speak Cantonese?

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.670
Just so-so.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.510
Hold on tight.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:39.070
Okay.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.660
Your Cantonese sounds nice.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.610
That's because you haven't heard
a native speaker.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.340
The ones in movies don't count.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.190
Three years, then another 3 years.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.190
The farthest place I've ever been

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.590
is the provincial capital.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.650
For work?

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.400
When I just got out,

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.579
a friend told me to go clear my head.

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.380
I stayed a few days and came back.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.620
I don't like crowded places.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.540
Were there few people in prison?

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:10.710
In prison...

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.120
How come I never noticed

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.570
you talk just like your sister before?

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:19.980
I taught her everything.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.360
The buns are toasted!

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.100
Come back and eat!

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.890
Coming!

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.240
We're coming back!

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:31.480
Giddy up!

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.970
Aren't you riding pretty well?

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:35.500
Giddy up!

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.380
Slow down!

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.170
Who said I couldn't ride?

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:39.090
Giddy up!

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.850
Slow down!

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:40.400
Giddy up!

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.120
Here it is.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:51.320
This person

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.000
left Qinghai

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.190
in 2000.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.960
His household registration
is now in Shandong.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.310
Next. Wang Fumin.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:01.280
Missing.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.910
Bai Ju,

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.810
where did you

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:05.810
find this information?

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:06.810
It's so detailed.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.770
Why is there Tibetan in it?

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.460
I have an informant.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.320
You're full of secrets.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.310
Wang Fumin.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.209
Born on March 27,

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.829
1953.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.829
Dongxiang County, Tianduo.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.570
He has a son, Wang Jian.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.900
This Wang Jian

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.500
doesn't have a steady job.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.740
He lives off odd jobs.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.050
I don't know if he's in at this hour.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.180
This building

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.710
is full of migrant workers.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.240
Rent is cheap here,

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:44.060
and it's pretty chaotic.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:49.170
Wang Jian.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.610
Tell us everything you know.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.150
Don't hold anything back.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.700
Captain Xie,

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:55.240
Captain Bai,

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.300
I'll head back now.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.909
Okay.

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:58.370
Thanks for your hard work.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.200
Wang Jian.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:03.510
Relax.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.410
We're just here

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.070
to understand the situation.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:07.270
Don't bother.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.140
Well, this...

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:11.590
Put them here.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.770
Wang Jian,

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.250
when was the last time

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.800
your father contacted you?

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:17.920
Well, I...

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.400
I don't remember clearly.

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:20.360
I think

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.070
it was in 1997.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.330
Not long after he went to South Asia,

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.910
he sent back 50,000 yuan.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.380
He telegraphed to say

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.690
he'd come home after making

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.090
big money working there.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.180
Where was the telegraph sent from?

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.540
South Asia.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.480
He sent money back the first 2 years,

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:38.940
but then

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.320
we lost contact.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.750
When exactly did he

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.030
leave for work in 1997?

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.210
I think

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.940
it was autumn.

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.040
Autumn.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.320
So, all these years,

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.170
you never looked for your father?

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.640
Well, I did.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:56.450
Back then,

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.140
when the money he sent ran out,

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:59.510
I wanted to find him.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.990
But for so many years,

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.250
there has been no news.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.060
My uncle

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.330
even followed the telegraph address

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.710
to South Asia once.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.950
They said

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.630
no such person existed there.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.040
Did your father

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.360
go alone that year,

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.340
or did he go with companions?

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:17.920
He said

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.470
someone was going with him,

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.080
but he didn't say who.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.030
He told me not to ask too many questions.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.400
When your father was home,

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.730
who was he closest to?

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.659
Did you meet any of his colleagues
back then?

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.500
There was an uncle.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.390
When my dad went on

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:38.510
long-haul drives,

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:39.409
he would come

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:40.690
to check on us

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:41.920
and bring us things.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.770
Later on,

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.470
after my dad went to South Asia,

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:45.500
that uncle

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.560
never came again.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.640
What is that uncle's name?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.740
I...

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:51.830
I called him Uncle...

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:52.790
Uncle Wu.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:53.700
Uncle Wu?

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.240
Which "Wu"?

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.280
I don't know.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.540
I just called him that as a kid.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.750
I don't know

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.460
what his last name really is.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:03.620
Wang Jian,

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:05.870
take a look at this photo.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:09.350
Is this him?

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:15.520
But as I recall,

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.130
Uncle Wu had thick lips.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.190
I can't remember clearly.

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.590
It's been too many years.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.600
It's okay.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:27.480
Captain Xie.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:28.730
We've checked.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.500
Wang Fumin does have a cousin.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.010
There are entry and exit records

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:33.190
for his trip to South Asia 6 years ago.

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:34.250
The timeline matches.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.050
It seems Wang Jian wasn't lying.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.990
But as for Wang Fumin,

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.550
there is no passport information

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.010
or entry and exit records.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:43.370
Going abroad was expensive.

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:44.130
Given Wang Fumin's

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.220
income situation,

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:45.950
back then,

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:48.310
he likely smuggled himself out.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:49.100
The time he left the country

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.000
highly coincides with the time

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.659
Captain Duojie went missing.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.120
Now his whereabouts are unknown,

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.520
so he's probably fled to avoid punishment.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:56.430
Fan.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.570
Check against

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.430
the list from Hongyuan Freight Company

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.010
to see

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.370
if there was an employee

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.500
surnamed Wu
with the falling-rising tone back then.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:03.890
Okay.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.330
Which Wu?

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.150
How many Wus can there be?

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:08.390
Just check them all.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:10.870
Got it, Captain Bai.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:11.670
Just a moment.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.570
Hurry up.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:18.560
Captain Bai,

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:19.360
found it.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:20.530
No one's surname is Wu
with the falling-rising tone,

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:21.640
but there's only one

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.840
with the rising tone,

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:23.670
Wu Jiang.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:32.740
Are you blind?

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.080
Who are you talking to, you old geezer?

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.210
What did you call me?

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:38.270
Getting old,

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.030
eyes dim, legs weak,

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:41.510
and hard of hearing, too!

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:42.870
Old geezer!

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:52.700
Security!

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.830
Make way! Security!

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:57.770
Stop fighting!

00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:59.780
Stop fighting!

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.370
Calm down, Mr. Wu!

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:02.170
You just wait!

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.480
Don't run, you brat!

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:05.740
Don't run, you brat!

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:06.550
You just wait!

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.050
Mr. Wu, Mr. Wu, you're bleeding!

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:09.070
Help stop the bleeding, quick!

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:09.980
Hurry, hurry!

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:10.690
Stop the bleeding now!

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:11.360
Get lost!

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:12.960
Mr. Wu! Mr. Wu!

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:13.820
It's fine, everyone.

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.080
Just a small misunderstanding.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:15.670
Small misunderstanding.

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:16.290
It's okay. It's okay.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:18.150
Tell everyone to keep having fun.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:37.910
Murder!

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.000
Still tough?

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.660
Get up!

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:40.600
Get up!

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:41.820
Murder!

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:43.870
Murder!

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.130
Murder!

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.180
Police!

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:47.150
Murder!

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:47.820
Freeze!

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:49.300
Stay right there!

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:49.840
Freeze!

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.050
Stand back!

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:52.510
He's a murderer!

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:53.540
Murder!

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.320
Officer,

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.840
he hit me first.

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:56.720
H-He tried to kill me!

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.530
He tried to kill me!

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:58.790
Look at what he did to me.

00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:59.890
That doesn't mean you can beat him

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:00.510
with a baseball bat.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:01.080
Don't move!

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:01.980
Stay right there!

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:02.320
I... I...

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.980
I was just trying to scare him.

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:04.980
Are you okay?

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:05.700
Can you get up?

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:06.030
I'm not okay.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:06.790
I can't get up.

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:07.200
I can't get up.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:07.670
Officer,

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:08.750
he's faking it.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:09.770
I didn't really hurt him.

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:10.460
Quiet.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:11.580
I'll call the police next time.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:12.480
Definitely call the police.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.480
Now you think of calling the police?

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.350
Do you need to go to the hospital?

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:20.580
Can you stand?

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:21.380
I can't get up.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:22.680
Where are you hurt?

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:23.980
My lungs.

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:25.270
Get up first.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:26.370
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:27.370
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:28.430
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:29.890
Don't hit me. Don't hit me.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:30.790
Call an ambulance first.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:31.250
Don't hit me.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:32.250
Are you okay, Bro?

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:34.930
Call an ambulance, hurry.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.000
You, get up.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:36.500
Mr. Wu.

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:38.340
Come here for a second.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:39.140
What's wrong?

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.070
Officer Bai.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.800
My trunk is a mess.

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:45.190
Sorry about that.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.640
This is all your stuff,

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.170
isn't it?

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:48.790
Yes.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.850
This is a controlled knife.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:55.710
I'm confiscating it.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:56.910
This is a craft piece.

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:59.290
A craft piece with a sharpened blade?

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:02.290
Officer,

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:03.030
a friend gave it to...

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.690
Don't move!

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:04.290
Captain Xie,

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:04.910
cuff him!

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:05.530
You've got the wrong guy!

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:05.810
Behave yourself!

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:07.240
He hit me first!

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:07.740
Get up!

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:10.470
Captain Xie.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:11.130
Get his bag.

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:12.170
That one.

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:21.770
Speak! Where did you get this?

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:22.880
It... It...

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:24.010
It... It...

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:25.180
It isn't mine!

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:26.860
T-This gun really isn't mine!

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:27.440
If it's not yours,

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.640
why was it in your car?

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:29.340
Officers,

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:30.690
I didn't do it.

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:31.480
I didn't.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.890
I didn't!

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.000
I don't know

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.550
where this thing came from!

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:41.290
[Criminal Police Brigade]

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:46.230
[Wu Jiang][Transportation]
[National Highway 109]

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:55.530
Bai Ju.

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:57.950
The ballistics report is out.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.580
Tests confirm the ballistic markings

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.460
from the submitted gun

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:05.980
match the bullet markings
found on the body

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.180
in the skeleton case.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.760
It also matches

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:09.770
bullet 027 markings

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:11.570
from the Qima'er Gold Mine case.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.710
All were fired from the submitted gun.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:29.910
I told you

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:31.460
that gun really isn't mine.

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.700
This is the crime scene photo
showing the gun

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.700
found in the trunk of your car.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:40.970
You must explain

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:42.370
where this gun came from.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:43.270
I really don't know

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.850
how that gun got in my car.

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:46.020
I told you

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.020
I'm being framed.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.500
Do you know Duojie?

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.280
Didn't you ask this before?

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:51.900
County Mayor Duo.

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:53.120
I know him.

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:54.320
Have you met him?

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:58.520
P-Probably not.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:00.900
I-I can't remember clearly.

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:04.400
Let me refresh your memory.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:08.510
This is your work history.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.190
Eighteen years ago,

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:10.790
you worked

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.790
at Mazhi Hongyuan Freight Company.

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:13.940
Yes.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.540
So what?

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:16.910
Just answer the questions.

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:18.120
Don't ask questions back.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.120
You should answer

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:20.070
whatever we ask.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.590
In 1997

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:24.150
and 1998,

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:25.970
what route did you usually take?

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.080
National Highway 109.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:30.890
Back then,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.320
that was the only road

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.410
from Mazhi to the provincial capital.

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:35.720
Duojie went missing

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:36.600
on that road

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:37.640
on his way
from the provincial capital's airport

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:38.360
to Mazhi.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:40.520
Forensic examination has confirmed

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.510
that the ballistics markings
of the gun found in your vehicle

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:43.460
match the bullet wound

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:44.530
on the suspected body

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:46.130
of Duojie that we unearthed.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:48.120
How do you explain that?

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:48.910
Nonsense!

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.940
Impossible!

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:51.360
I didn't kill anyone.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.650
Y-You...

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.350
Are you guys mistaken?

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:56.450
I-I'm wronged!

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:57.860
Someone wants to frame me!

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:58.660
Calm down!

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.520
Can shouting solve the problem?

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:03.220
The evidence is irrefutable.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:04.050
You'd better come clean

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:04.960
about where this gun came from

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.320
and your relationship with Duojie.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.570
That's your only way out.

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:09.540
I really have nothing to do with him!

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.200
What do you want me to confess?

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:14.330
Let me rephrase the question.

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:16.550
Do you know Wang Fumin?

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:19.410
You used to work

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:20.530
at the same place.

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:22.670
Have you forgotten?

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:27.510
Yes, I know him.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:28.950
How was

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:30.100
your relationship?

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.750
Just average.

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:33.000
Did you help Wang Fumin

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.480
go abroad?

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:42.060
Wu Jiang,

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:43.340
answer the question!

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.060
I don't know what you're asking.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:48.070
Officer,

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.240
someone must have

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:50.050
deliberately

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:51.480
set a trap for me.

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.950
I'm truly innocent.

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:54.570
Someone is trying to frame me!

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:55.300
Then tell me,

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:57.230
who's framing you?

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.070
With my temper,

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:06.210
I've offended plenty of people.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:06.960
Besides,

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.580
the tea and wine

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:09.610
in my trunk

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.610
were given to me by someone

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:11.860
just that afternoon.

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:14.580
There are cameras
in the company's parking lot.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:15.560
You can check.

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:16.840
I remember that bag

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.560
wasn't in the car at the time.

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:19.190
Did you go

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.150
to the Qima'er Gold Mine back then?

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.860
Someone is out to get me.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:27.980
I want a lawyer.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:30.300
Until then,

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:32.900
I won't answer any more questions.

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:48.580
Captain.

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:51.110
Is this the footage
from the Xinhai parking lot?

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.610
Yes.

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:55.850
Any findings?

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:58.490
The car was in its assigned spot,

00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:59.490
just like he said.

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:00.780
Over 2 days,

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:01.330
the trunk was only opened once

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:02.030
when someone delivered

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:03.150
something to him.

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.920
But you can't see

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:06.210
inside the trunk at all.

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:06.690
Look.

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:11.420
What about surveillance from other places?

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:12.480
Retrieving it now.

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:13.650
Here they are.

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:14.450
Here they are.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:16.010
This is from the garage

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:17.350
at Wu Jiang's complex.

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:17.780
This is from the entrance

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:19.240
of the Pharaoh Nightclub.

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:20.160
Give it to me.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.890
Give that to me. Give that to me.

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:23.240
Let me take over.

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:24.750
You've been watching all afternoon.

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:25.780
You have to interrogate him tomorrow.

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:26.690
Go back and get some rest.

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:27.150
Fan and I

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:28.570
will stay here and watch.

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:30.250
It's nothing.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.360
Back in the Uninhabited Zone,

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.590
I traveled by day,

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:34.640
watched by night,

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.340
and caught poachers at dawn.

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:38.400
I basically didn't need sleep.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.340
How old were you then?

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:40.400
How old are you now?

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:42.030
If you were

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:43.150
Fan's age,

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:45.000
I wouldn't bother with you.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:45.830
Captain,

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.250
how can you say that?

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:48.860
My master is still young.

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.830
It's precisely because I'm not young.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:53.630
I need to hurry up with my work.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.000
There isn't much time

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:55.850
left to waste.

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:58.910
It's not that you aren't young.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.530
You're just impatient.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:05.849
Hello?

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:10.420
Any broken bones?

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:10.960
Okay, okay.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.160
I'm coming right now.

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:13.150
What's wrong?

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:14.400
My kid fell.

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:15.940
I have to go to the hospital.

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:16.940
Is it serious?

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:18.079
I don't know.

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:19.569
Here. I'm leaving it to you.

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:20.200
Go quickly.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.050
Don't worry about anything else.

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:21.420
Okay.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:22.420
If anything happens,

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:22.980
let me know immediately.

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:23.760
Go, go.

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:24.260
Stop worrying.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:25.060
Bye, Captain.

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:35.530
Which one

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:36.550
is Wu Jiang's car?

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:50.000
Damn it.

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:51.140
It's a blind spot.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.330
This car.

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:53.550
The trunk is blocked.

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:54.820
Are you kidding me?

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:56.850
You can't see

00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:58.030
anything at all.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:01.110
Captain Bai,

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:02.550
do we still check?

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:04.680
We have nothing to lose.

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:05.440
Check.

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:07.050
Screen everything first.

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:07.620
On it.

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:18.180
What is it?

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:19.440
Wake up. Come here.

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:21.460
Hurry.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:28.480
Look here.

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.300
Look at this reflection.

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:33.470
Looks like there was someone.

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.180
But I can't see who it was.

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:38.610
Did he touch the trunk?

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.290
That light-colored car next to it.

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:44.460
It looks

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:45.550
a bit familiar.

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.870
That's right.

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:57.370
That's Mr. Meng's car.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:19:59.850
The day Wu Jiang was arrested,

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:00.400
were you also

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.460
in that nightclub?

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:02.460
No.

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:03.550
That night, we were

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:06.350
entertaining guests
at the restaurant next door.

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:09.140
Mr. Meng!

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:09.980
I thought

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:11.980
you weren't interested in coming here.

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:13.250
Let's have a drink later.

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:14.240
I'm meeting someone

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.440
for dinner next door,

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:16.770
but the parking lot there

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:17.710
is full.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.130
I just want to park here.

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:21.900
I'm running late.

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:23.610
Why don't you let me park here,

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.030
and you park over there?

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.490
Fine, I'll do you a favor.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:32.750
You never left

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:34.070
during the whole time?

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:35.310
No.

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.390
They were all VIP clients.

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:38.000
We couldn't possibly

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:38.820
leave in the middle.

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:40.270
As long as someone left that room,

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:40.870
it counts.

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.160
Even for a few minutes.

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:45.770
I think...

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:47.250
Yes.

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:49.660
Mr. Meng went out to take a call.

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:50.850
But it was less than 5 minutes.

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:52.010
He came back very quickly.

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:53.270
What time did he go out?

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:55.920
When he went out,

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:57.380
we were almost done eating.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.380
We were about to have the staple food.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:00.240
9 or 10 o'clock.

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:01.870
After 10 o'clock, I think.

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:03.270
Right, after 10 o'clock.

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:10.270
Then do you think

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:12.160
this person is Meng Yaohui?

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.800
Is there someone in this?

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:32.770
This.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:38.160
This...

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:39.340
This...

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:41.340
How can you tell anything from this?

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.070
Mr. Meng,

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.930
Mr. Feng is waiting for you.

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:08.000
Mr. Feng.

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:10.240
You're back.

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:18.750
[Freedom and Overstep]

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:21.010
How do you pronounce the last character?

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:23.880
Jian.

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:27.500
What does it mean?

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:30.580
Overstepping one's bounds.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:41.550
Zhao.

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:47.330
How do you pronounce the last character?

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:49.820
Chairman,

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:51.100
may I go

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:52.270
check a dictionary?

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:12.250
Do you think

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.320
she knows this character?

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:16.470
Yes.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:17.780
Then why

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:18.870
didn't she tell me?

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:26.850
I told you to get in touch

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:28.980
with that police officer surnamed Bai

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.720
to make use of her.

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.540
Is this how you make use of her?

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:34.910
Mr. Feng.

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:37.000
My idea is simple.

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.140
Since they've found Duojie's body,

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.000
they won't let this go.

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:46.330
If they investigate me next,

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:49.710
they'll find out about you, Xinhai,

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:51.980
and what happened back then.

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.470
Where is Wang Fumin now?

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:55.730
I don't know.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.510
Wang Fumin abandoned his family back then

00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:59.910
and ran off to South Asia.

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:01.680
We lost contact years ago.

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:04.170
He has a son in Dongxiang County.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.140
I heard the police have already
checked him out.

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:16.480
What do you think

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:18.040
Wu Jiang

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:19.070
will say in there?

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.270
His status at Hongyuan

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:24.020
was given by you.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:25.750
Without you,

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:26.920
he would be nothing.

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:29.200
If he doesn't admit

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.730
to his history at Hongyuan,

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:32.690
he'll have to spill

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.720
his real history.

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:35.530
Between those matters

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:36.680
and the murder case,

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.360
he knows which is more serious

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:39.510
perfectly well.

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:40.680
So,

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.300
he probably won't say anything.

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:45.790
None of us expected

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:46.720
that he had a murder charge

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.270
hanging over him.

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:50.080
I barely even

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:51.110
interacted with him

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.760
at work.

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:54.020
On the night Wu Jiang was arrested,

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:56.190
were you eating at the nearby restaurant?

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:56.680
Yes.

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.120
In a private room.

00:24:58.460 --> 00:24:59.920
Did you go out at any point?

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:01.010
I went out once.

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:03.380
To make a phone call.

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:05.150
Did you leave the restaurant?

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:06.680
No, I made it in the hallway.

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:08.230
Who did you call?

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:13.160
I called a colleague

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:16.300
to discuss the next day's work.

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:24.990
The time of his call matches

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:26.100
the time on the surveillance footage

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.140
when Wu Jiang's trunk

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:28.270
was opened.

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:31.070
He had it all planned out.

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:34.650
I'll get the team

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:36.220
to dig deeper into

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:38.030
Meng Yaohui's social connections.

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:38.460
Okay.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.230
[Chenlong Coal Mine] [Pass]

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:50.220
Go.

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:47.370
We're here.

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:48.390
Shoot now.

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:50.250
Hurry up.

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:50.850
Okay, okay.

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:52.050
It'll be trouble if we're spotted.

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:53.110
Alright, alright.

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:00.220
Hurry up.

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:05.980
Are you done?

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.570
A minute. A minute.

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:24.450
The safety officer is coming.

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:25.450
Hide, quick.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.170
Cover me up, come on.

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:26.930
Hurry, hurry.

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:27.370
Quick.

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.440
Stop, stop.

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:36.090
Stop.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:46.050
Manager Bai.

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:47.950
Who is in your truck?

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:50.580
Just me.

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:51.400
No one else.

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:52.440
Get out!

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:55.010
Get out!

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:07.060
Manager Bai.

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:24.440
What are you doing here?

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:28.850
Chun.

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:37.220
There are rules in the mine.

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:38.540
You can't bring outsiders in.

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:39.670
Don't you know that?

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:42.540
No, don't blame him.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.460
I asked him to do it.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.030
As for you,

00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:46.430
I'll deal with you later.

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:53.580
I'll tell

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:54.680
your fleet captain

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.070
that you have family matters to deal with

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:57.070
and are quitting.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.240
Go pack your things now

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.970
and process your resignation.

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:05.590
Thank you, Manager Bai.

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:17.200
See that?

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:18.640
You caused this.

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:21.640
I have a classmate in Inner Mongolia

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:22.500
who runs a mine.

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:23.350
I've already recommended him

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:24.280
to go work there.

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:30.670
Take a look.

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:32.170
Look at what you've done.

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:36.220
What?

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:37.600
Didn't you know

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:40.090
the rectification
has turned out like this?

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:42.240
Before, Wu Jiang

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:42.840
was in charge of this.

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:44.300
It's my first time in here.

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:52.250
What are you doing?

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:53.330
Move aside!

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.020
What are you doing?

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:57.070
Why did you delete my photos?

00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:58.230
These photos can't get out!

00:29:58.230 --> 00:29:58.630
You...

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:00.060
Bai Chun,

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.420
you've worked in mines for years.

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:02.460
Has the dust blinded you,

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:04.660
or has the slag buried your conscience?

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:06.200
Xinhai just took back

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.640
management of the small mines.

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.370
There might be some oversight.

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:11.330
The mining is indeed a bit crude.

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:13.300
Such serious environmental pollution,

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:13.740
and to you,

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:14.720
it's just a casual remark

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:15.700
about crude mining?

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:17.220
Then tell me, what is

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:18.480
management oversight?

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:18.960
Open-pit mines

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.220
are bound to have dust.

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:20.940
But a lot of dust

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:22.340
doesn't mean pollution.

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:23.640
If you go farm in a field,

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.760
you'll get covered in dirt.

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:25.820
Is that pollution?

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:30.180
Now you're just

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:31.200
being unreasonable, aren't you?

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:31.590
I am trying

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:33.190
to reason with you right now.

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:34.160
Could you please drop

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:35.400
your ignorant bias?

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:37.500
You always talk about
environmental protection,

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:38.200
keeping fixating

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:38.890
on our open-pit mine.

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:39.930
Do you know
what environmental protection is?

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:40.470
I...

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:41.760
A lot of dust

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:42.790
just doesn't look good, that's all.

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:43.310
But at least,

00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:44.030
it doesn't leave behind

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:45.520
non-degradable artificial substances

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:46.980
buried deep underground.

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:48.420
Go look abroad.

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:49.520
Many countries

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:50.830
rely mainly on open-pit mining.

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:52.350
I don't care about other countries.

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:53.700
I only care about what's in front of me.

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.350
Look for yourself!

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.180
The dust situation in your mine

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:57.300
is currently

00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:58.480
very serious.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:30:59.830
So what if there's dust?

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:00.570
Back when

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:01.520
you entered Bolamula,

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:02.640
it was also dusty inside.

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.180
There were sandstorms every other day.

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:05.840
Why didn't you choke to death?

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:11.290
Move aside!

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:12.680
Give it back to me!

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:15.960
I shouldn't have come here

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.490
to meddle in your business.

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.480
I should have let the security team

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.280
deal with you.

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:20.910
If you have energy to spare,

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:23.120
care more about your child.

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:30.180
Bring the car up.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.370
Take him away.

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:41.030
Come in.

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:57.270
Who are you?

00:31:58.100 --> 00:31:59.100
Hello, Mr. Wu.

00:31:59.240 --> 00:31:59.790
I am the lawyer

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:01.250
Mr. Feng arranged for you.

00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:02.310
My name is Xu Quan.

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.540
I haven't seen you at the company.

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:06.220
Mr. Wu,

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.750
there seems to be a misunderstanding.

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:09.210
I am not a Xinhai employee.

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:13.190
I've checked your case.

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:15.310
There is still room for defense.

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:16.920
My suggestion is that...

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.530
you plead guilty first.

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:21.740
In court,

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:23.760
you insist that you confessed voluntarily

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:24.820
and have repented.

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:26.730
Just stick to this point.

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:28.700
Maybe...

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:32.080
you'll get life imprisonment.

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:35.780
You can leave.

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:37.300
I don't need this.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:38.160
Mr. Wu.

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:41.810
This is also what Mr. Feng wants.

00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:44.540
What does that mean?

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:48.490
What does the boss mean by this?

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.140
Everyone knows perfectly well

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:52.220
who owns that gun.

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:53.800
What are they doing now?

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.300
Pinning it on me?

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:57.140
If I'm not doing a good job,

00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:58.500
just fire me.

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:00.510
Why go through all this trouble?

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:02.070
Mr. Feng asked me to tell you

00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:04.850
to cooperate with me with peace of mind.

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:06.090
As for things outside,

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:07.020
no need to worry.

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:09.180
As for your family,

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:11.470
the company will take good care of them

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:13.200
and do your filial duty for you.

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:31.500
I've read the draft

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:32.470
you wrote.

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:34.540
It was written very well.

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:37.670
Then why did you

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:38.440
tell our Chief Editor

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:39.440
not to publish it?

00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:41.660
In here,

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:42.680
regarding Chenlong's rectification,

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:43.270
the details described

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:44.530
are true, aren't they?

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:46.210
Reporter Shao.

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:49.590
Does truth represent the whole picture?

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:51.160
How much of their work

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:52.530
did you actually see?

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:54.680
Do you have any factual basis?

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:56.740
Actually,

00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:57.880
I took photos at the time.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:58.900
But later...

00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:00.590
Come in.

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:02.220
Director Huang.

00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:04.230
Mr. Feng, you're here.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.460
Reporter Shao is here too.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.000
Were you doing an interview?

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:09.850
Should I

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:11.250
excuse myself for a moment?

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:12.920
Just understanding the situation.

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.500
Mr. Feng, you came at the right time.

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:15.340
Let Reporter Shao

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:16.690
interview you properly.

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:18.420
Reporter Shao, what do you say?

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:19.500
Come, come.

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:20.260
Please sit.

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:21.690
Reporter Shao, sit here.

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:24.080
Mr. Feng.

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:25.940
Reporter Shao

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:27.520
is very concerned

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:28.719
about our Tianduo coal industry.

00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:29.380
We were just

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.800
talking about Chenlong.

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:31.590
Look at this.

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:46.480
This really is my oversight.

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:49.230
The head of Chenlong

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:50.590
has had some issues recently.

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:52.449
So the staff got out of hand.

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:54.210
Once the new management

00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:55.420
is in place,

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.770
I promise we'll enforce

00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:58.410
strict regulations.

00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:00.030
As long as it's cleared up.

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:01.820
Rectification

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:03.360
takes time.

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:06.040
Director Huang.

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:07.720
I brought

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:08.940
a photo album today.

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:13.040
Since you're here,

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.260
Reporter Shao,

00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:15.690
please give some advice.

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:17.550
I wouldn't call it advice.

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:18.070
Thank you.

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:18.530
Reporter Shao,

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:19.710
you might not know

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.130
that Mr. Feng likes photography.

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:22.760
Whenever he's free,

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:24.530
he goes out to shoot nature.

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:25.940
He's also

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:27.500
the Honorary Chairman

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:29.990
of the Tianduo Photographers Association.

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:31.630
Several of these photos

00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:32.710
are award-winning,

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:33.280
and they really capture

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:34.740
the beauty of our plateau.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.820
[Tianduo Commercial Bank]
[One million Yuan only]

00:35:44.590 --> 00:35:45.590
What do you think?

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:09.280
Great shots,

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:10.700
but don't take any more.

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:13.030
Reporter Shao,

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:14.690
what do you mean by that?

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:19.150
If I'm not mistaken,

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:20.350
this is a photo

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:21.940
of Mount Chawuma, right?

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:25.620
You have a sharp eye, Reporter Shao.

00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:27.510
And for this shot,

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:29.450
you didn't use a telephoto lens.

00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:30.880
You must have driven

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:31.880
right up to the mountain

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.070
and used a medium-wide

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:34.300
or a wide-angle lens.

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.160
Right?

00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:47.760
The landscape of Mount Chawuma

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:48.800
is unique

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:50.660
because the sandy surface

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:52.220
is covered in black gravel.

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:54.730
This gravel,

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:56.260
after years of weathering,

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:57.900
forms a hard crust.

00:36:58.260 --> 00:36:59.920
Once crushed by tires,

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:01.230
the landscape won't recover

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:02.390
for over 100 years.

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:11.120
Reporters

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.500
should stick to the facts.

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.340
You didn't see it yourself.

00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:18.450
Making such a judgment

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:20.010
is a bit rash, isn't it?

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:21.800
You have to be responsible

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.440
for what you say.

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:25.460
I didn't see it.

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:28.190
But my conscience did.

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:29.860
Whether you went there or not,

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:31.150
you know the truth.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:51.460
Farewell.

00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:53.870
Reporter Shao.

00:37:59.330 --> 00:38:00.270
We welcome you

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:01.670
to Tianduo.

00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:02.420
If you can

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:03.880
give our coal companies

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:05.450
more positive publicity,

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:06.400
I believe

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:07.230
Mr. Feng and I

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:08.640
will fully cooperate.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:10.000
But if you

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.020
keep writing articles like this...

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:16.090
I heard you're close

00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:17.730
to Mayor Lin.

00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:18.800
Why don't you

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:20.270
ask him what he thinks?

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:33.440
Mayor Lin.

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:41.540
Uncle Lin.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:42.510
Shao,

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:43.400
what are you doing here?

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:45.000
Why didn't you come to the house?

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:45.710
Last time

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:46.980
at the stadium...

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:51.390
Didn't you get altitude sickness?

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:53.720
Your Auntie Zhu gave me an earful.

00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:54.940
Come on, let's go home.

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:55.630
Uncle Lin.

00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:58.390
Was it you

00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.600
who blocked my draft?

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:05.650
Why?

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:10.670
Shao,

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:11.790
Tianduo

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:13.190
looks good right now,

00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:15.880
but there are very few

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:17.010
truly high-quality enterprises.

00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:17.720
Moreover,

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:20.090
among the black, white,
and red industries,

00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:21.690
regarding the distribution,

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:23.320
the black industry is the pillar.

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:24.290
If your report

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.170
gets out,

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:26.060
really...

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.320
If it really brings down Xinhai,

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:31.240
how will the city develop?

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:31.990
Tourism?

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:34.910
I said this over 10 years ago.

00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:36.070
If anyone wants

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:37.700
to come here for tourism,

00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:38.810
before they come,

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:40.930
I need to build the hospitals first.

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:42.900
So we just ignore the environment?

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:43.760
If we just let it

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:44.890
continue like this,

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:45.650
in the future,

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:47.130
it will take more time and money

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:48.240
to restore the environment.

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.040
By then, we...

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:51.110
Environmental protection is right,

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:52.130
but

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:54.510
it must be done gradually.

00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:56.730
So you're saying

00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:57.880
the city allows Xinhai

00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:59.280
to conduct such messy...

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:02.570
rectification?

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:03.650
Of course.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.820
If there are problems, we solve them.

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:07.930
You...

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:10.520
If a report like yours

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:11.330
gets out,

00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:13.090
and if the chain reaction

00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:14.290
can't be controlled,

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:15.820
then how much tax revenue

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.090
will the city lose?

00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:17.910
Have you

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:18.970
considered this

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:20.260
as a reporter?

00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:23.890
And as you saw

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:24.770
at the meeting,

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:26.930
my opinion actually

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:27.950
doesn't align

00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:28.980
with Mayor Wang's.

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:29.670
But

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:30.760
I'm about to retire,

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:31.830
so I can't openly

00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:33.230
disagree with him.

00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:34.800
Otherwise, people will say

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.030
that at the end of my term,

00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:36.710
I'm being

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:38.350
irresponsible

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:39.900
and reckless.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.070
It's hard for me to explain,

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:41.550
isn't it?

00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:43.010
Yes, Uncle Lin,

00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:43.870
I understand

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:44.900
everything you said.

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:46.180
I sympathize with you.

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.720
I really don't want
to make things difficult,

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:48.550
but the current environment...

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:49.550
Personally,

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:51.640
I really don't care.

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:53.500
You can ask

00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:54.930
the citizens of Tianduo.

00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:56.130
Ask them

00:40:56.930 --> 00:40:59.220
and see whether more people
support the coal mine

00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:00.420
or oppose it.

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:03.460
I believe,

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:05.980
since they all benefit from it,

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:08.440
most of them support it.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:15.120
You'll be transferred sooner or later.

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:17.380
As a reporter from the provincial capital,

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:18.830
writing a few reports here

00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:19.690
is easy for you.

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:21.480
But if you leave,

00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:23.030
who will deal

00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:24.460
with the remaining mess?

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:26.150
It will still be us,

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:28.210
the officials and people of Tianduo.

00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:36.360
You've come to me

00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:38.440
about this many times already.

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:39.300
In that case,

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:40.610
let's be frank.

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:43.880
Don't take offense at my bluntness.

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:44.920
As long as I

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.360
hold this position,

00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:48.490
I will still block

00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:51.220
such reports like yours.

00:42:02.530 --> 00:42:04.910
[Tianduo Deji Hospital]

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:09.230
You're in so much pain,

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:10.560
yet you can still smile.

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:12.820
Who would have thought

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:14.290
that the exchange expert at our hospital

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:16.360
from Beijing would be you?

00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:19.620
Liu Sen.

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.960
You didn't even tell me you were coming.

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:23.840
Are your wife and kid in Beijing?

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:25.410
I brought them with me.

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:27.300
I have to stay
at Tianduo People's Hospital

00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:28.400
for at least 3 years.

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:29.470
That's great.

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:31.360
You're a local, after all.

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.680
What's so great about it?

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:36.650
Ms. Zhang.

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:37.580
Your

00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:38.800
herniated disc

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:39.790
is very serious.

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:40.500
I'll prescribe you

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:41.920
a course of physical therapy.

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:43.040
Do it for a few days in a row

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:44.640
to reduce the inflammation.

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:46.960
Back then,

00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:48.200
conditions were tough.

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.400
The work was intense,

00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:51.710
and you didn't use your hips correctly.

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:53.050
As you get older,

00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:55.010
it might affect your daily life.

00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:57.480
This is an old problem.

00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:58.150
I'm fine.

00:42:58.180 --> 00:42:59.900
You shouldn't take it lightly.

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:01.000
The worst case back then

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000
was County Mayor Duojie.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:02.840
His herniated disc

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.110
compressed his nerves.

00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:05.600
His legs would go numb.

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:09.080
You know about that?
