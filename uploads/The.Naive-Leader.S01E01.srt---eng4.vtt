WEBVTT

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:30.599
The prosperity of the Southwest region

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:32.480
is the envy of everyone in the land.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.359
The Central Government has always viewed this place as a strong rear area.

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:36.519
Submitting to the Central Government,

00:01:36.519 --> 00:01:37.239
supporting the Central Government,

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:38.239
what an honor that is.

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:40.920
Take a long-term view.

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:43.680
Don't get hung up on immediate, petty profits.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.079
Senator He,

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.680
it was Division Commander Liao under Army Commander Liu

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:48.959
who played dirty first.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.879
He's the villain crying victim!

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:52.719
It was clearly your subordinate,

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.599
that Zhongjiang cousin, Division Commander Chen,

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.359
who seized our army's grain fields first.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.840
We merely

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.120
took back the grain harvested from the fields,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.560
that is all.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.599
As long as Army Commander Liu returns the military grain to me,

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:06.599
I will shake hands and make peace with him immediately.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.480
If you return the fields and the grain in full,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.959
I can still be cooperative.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.959
What are you saying?

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.919
You want the grain,

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.759
and you want the fields too.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.360
You really want the baby,

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.919
and you want the baby's mother too.

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:21.479
How is that possible?

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:23.120
No deal, no deal.

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:24.240
So, no deal?

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:25.479
No deal.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.639
Then let's keep fighting.

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:29.800
Let's fight! Who's afraid of whom?

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.719
You think I'm scared of you?

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:32.800
I say we go outside right now and duel one-on-one!

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.840
Enough!

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.960
Stop playing the fool in front of me.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.360
I solemnly tell you,

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:40.719
the Central Government has specifically

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:42.479
established a reserve force for this purpose

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:43.879
to help you solve your problems.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.919
The superiors' intention is very simple.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.560
Either coexist peacefully

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.000
and serve the Central Government wholeheartedly,

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:51.280
or the Central Government will send a garrison

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:53.960
to help you coexist peacefully,

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.280
and teach you to serve the Central Government wholeheartedly.

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:17.439
In eastern Sichuan, surrounded by mountains,

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.360
lies a town beyond the reach of the law,

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.560
Weiyuan.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.759
In an era of rampant warlords and bandits,

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.919
the people there sang opera while eating bitter herbs,

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.719
finding joy amidst their suffering.

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.759
Especially this "Fool."

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.080
"Fool,"

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.560
is what Northerners call a "simpleton."

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.439
His foolishness was full of flavor,

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:39.280
foolish enough to make you laugh and cry,

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.000
foolish to a dizzying degree,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.439
foolish enough to knock you off your feet.

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:46.879
He couldn't see the power struggles above,

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.319
couldn't grasp the schemes of the middle powers,

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.360
and couldn't figure out the tricks of the common folk.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.199
He muddled through life as if it were a game.

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:58.639
As the saying goes,

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:00.840
"Strong winds reveal sturdy grass,"

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:02.879
"Turmoil produces heroes."

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.639
This Simpleton relied on his foolishness

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:07.639
to maneuver through the chaos,

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.840
subduing demons and monsters,

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.560
finally becoming a Sichuan Army general fighting Japan,

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:13.000
and living out a

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.960
legend in troubled times.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.800
Oh no.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.240
If I hadn't gone looking for you today,

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:21.639
how would you have come back?

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:23.319
You, stand still!

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.040
Did the food make you stupid?

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.920
You even poked a hornet's nest!

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.360
Look at how badly Zhang Mangzi got stung!

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.639
I hired a wet nurse at a high price,

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.439
and instead of feeding her own baby,

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.759
she used it all to treat his wounds.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.439
Zhang Mangzi bet that I wouldn't poke the nest.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.199
I poked it, but he was too stupid to run.

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:43.759
Is that my fault?

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:44.319
Bet?

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.240
Bet?

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.120
Bet?

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.279
You can't speak three sentences without betting, you!

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.480
Stand still!

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.759
Get down on the ground properly!

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:53.199
Tell me first,

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:54.399
how many hits?

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.279
Here it comes, here it comes.

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:56.600
The thick one is coming.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.639
Thick one?

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:01.959
Can I even lift this?

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:05.199
This cane is neither thick nor thin.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.519
It's just right.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.519
Do you know this cane?

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:10.720
This was my father's...

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:12.600
your great-grandfather's.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.079
Using it to beat you

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.959
would insult our ancestors' virtue.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.519
Like planting vegetables by the outhouse,

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:20.040
just make do with it.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.959
If you don't beat me,

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.600
your anger won't subside.

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:29.399
But if you beat me,

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:31.240
you'll get tired and fall ill.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.839
What will we do if you get sick?

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:36.879
You're actually afraid I'll get sick?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.560
Even if I'm good for nothing,

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.879
I still have that much filial piety.

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:43.680
You have it? Some filial piety!

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.279
Get down on the ground!

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.480
Granduncle,

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.959
tell me,

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.040
what do I have to do

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.639
for you to spare me?

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:56.800
The fighting is off.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.560
I'll let you off the hook.

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:01.360
Since they don't want us to fight...

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.639
We might as well play Mahjong.

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:03.480
Red Dragon.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.319
Regimental Commander Qin.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.199
Your Division Commander Chen is quite something.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.000
Sending a regimental commander to deal with us?

00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:10.240
Our Division Commander Chen is merely a scholar.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.000
He doesn't know how to handle guns and cannons.

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:14.720
Unlike you, Division Commander Wei.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.519
You can't bear to waste a single bullet.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.600
What did you say?

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.040
The higher-ups want us to value peace.

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:22.240
So let's stop with the little tricks.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.680
Let's go. Let's go.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.199
As for this man...

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:27.279
He sneaked into my military camp.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.720
Asking questions left and right.

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:30.000
You two...

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.759
Who can give me an explanation?

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:35.959
Sir, it's a misunderstanding!

00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:37.439
I'm just a fortune teller.

00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:40.079
You calculated that my Chief of Staff and Brigadier Wang...

00:06:40.079 --> 00:06:41.519
...were astrologically incompatible with me.

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:43.399
Why didn't you foresee...

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.160
...that you'd get caught by me today?

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.600
It really is a misunderstanding!

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.959
I was just telling fortunes on the street.

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:49.120
An officer said my readings were accurate.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.720
He insisted on dragging me into the camp...

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.199
...to read his superior's fortune.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.120
Once I started, I couldn't get away.

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:55.720
Every officer wanted me to read for them.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.160
Division Commander Wei, do you know this man?

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.439
Never seen him.

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:03.839
You don't know him either?

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:04.639
I don't know him either.

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:05.720
Just take him out and shoot him.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.879
Save us the trouble.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.360
Sir! Spare my life! Spare me!

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:10.839
I can predict many things!

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:12.120
I predict...

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.920
The order from above to fight...

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.600
...is actually just an excuse...

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.759
...to avoid being pushed around by the top brass.

00:07:19.079 --> 00:07:19.959
Not necessarily.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.000
One of Bamboo.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.639
One of Bamboo. Mahjong!

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:24.480
Full Flush.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.120
Wait.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.920
Two winners on one discard.

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:29.160
Mixed Terminals, single wait on the One of Bamboo.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.680
Brother Wei.

00:07:31.079 --> 00:07:33.560
You hit a headwind as soon as you set sail.

00:07:39.399 --> 00:07:41.360
The battle was called off just like that.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.000
Otherwise...

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.199
Your butt would have been beaten to a pulp.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.360
It means it wasn't my time to die.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.079
Men at birth are naturally good.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.360
Natures are similar, habits make them different.

00:07:56.839 --> 00:07:58.279
If not taught...

00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.920
If not taught...

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.639
If not taught, nature will change.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.199
I've recited the Three Character Classic for years.

00:08:06.399 --> 00:08:08.160
Don't I know that nature changes?

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.399
If not taught...

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.680
The dog doesn't bark?

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.399
Must have met someone it knows.

00:08:17.839 --> 00:08:19.279
Of course it won't bark.

00:08:19.279 --> 00:08:21.120
Even books written by sages have mistakes.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.240
Boring sages hang on the wall.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.399
Heroes and brave men roam the world.

00:08:33.079 --> 00:08:35.399
One day I'll walk the path of chivalry.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.080
Helping the weak, crushing the strong, gaining fame.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.200
Young Master.

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:42.759
The Old Master told me to supervise you.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:45.559
No food if you don't study hard.

00:08:47.639 --> 00:08:49.919
Fan Bao, you petty villain, you jinx.

00:08:49.919 --> 00:08:52.000
Putting on a hat and acting all high and mighty.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:52.919
I'm going off to play.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.200
Young Master!

00:08:54.519 --> 00:08:55.399
Where are you running off to?

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.600
You need to study!

00:08:57.159 --> 00:08:57.799
Granduncle!

00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.399
Young Master!

00:08:59.399 --> 00:09:00.519
Young Master, don't run!

00:09:00.519 --> 00:09:01.720
Study, Young Master!

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:02.960
Young Master!

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.240
Where are you going?

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.039
Young Master, where are you running?

00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:09.960
Study! You need to study!

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:10.960
Young Master!

00:09:11.759 --> 00:09:13.120
Young Master!

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.159
Young Master Fan

00:09:31.159 --> 00:09:31.799
Please come in, please come in

00:09:31.799 --> 00:09:32.600
Please come in

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:33.799
Please come in

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.759
Today we have

00:09:34.759 --> 00:09:36.159
Mengding Spring Tea and Jasmine

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:38.159
Xue Tao dried tofu for a good chew

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.120
Look

00:09:39.919 --> 00:09:40.519
The usual

00:09:40.519 --> 00:09:41.320
Got it

00:09:44.919 --> 00:09:46.840
I, the Great King

00:09:47.759 --> 00:09:50.279
Mu Guiying

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.399
Hello, Mistress

00:09:56.519 --> 00:09:57.360
Young Master Fan

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.440
Hello, Mistress

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.320
Put it down

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.720
Move aside

00:10:13.639 --> 00:10:15.159
Brother Fan, are you all right?

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.320
I came specifically to visit Master Wen.

00:10:20.879 --> 00:10:22.200
Brother Fan, hurry up and get up.

00:10:24.279 --> 00:10:25.240
I can tell.

00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:26.720
You really do like Sichuan opera.

00:10:26.879 --> 00:10:28.320
Let's exchange pointers more often in the future.

00:10:28.399 --> 00:10:30.279
It's more than just liking it.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.519
I feel that all my skills...

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.679
...were learned from listening to Master Wen's operas.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.200
That Fahai costume you gave me...

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.000
...I've kept it enshrined at home.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.120
I can't bear to wear it.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.799
Once I've mastered the skills...

00:10:42.799 --> 00:10:46.519
...we'll perform "Jinshan Temple" together.

00:10:46.759 --> 00:10:47.519
It's a deal.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.399
Worship heaven, earth, and Lord Guan.

00:10:52.519 --> 00:10:54.320
Betray your brothers and you'll be done for.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.360
The Brotherhood of Robbing the Rich to Feed the Poor.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.200
The poor folks all say it's right.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.440
You're late.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.320
Watch it next time.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.240
Okay.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.600
Didn't you rob a wealthy household?

00:11:11.879 --> 00:11:13.559
Why is there only this little bit of flour?

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:14.879
Ask him.

00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:17.320
People call him Liang Dahu.

00:11:17.759 --> 00:11:19.720
Turns out his name is actually Liang Dafu.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.320
I thought it meant...

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:22.840
...a big household with lots of grain.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.279
Cut the chatter.

00:11:25.639 --> 00:11:26.279
How do we split this?

00:11:26.879 --> 00:11:28.120
I did the scouting.

00:11:28.559 --> 00:11:29.679
I was the lookout.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.279
I did the cleanup.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.519
I should get an extra bowl.

00:11:34.039 --> 00:11:34.799
I pried the door.

00:11:34.799 --> 00:11:35.440
I climbed the window.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.320
I took the loot.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.159
Then I deserve an extra bowl even more.

00:11:38.759 --> 00:11:40.480
You both make good points.

00:11:40.799 --> 00:11:41.960
So, for the sake of fairness...

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.000
...we'll decide by a duel.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.399
Get lost.

00:11:44.679 --> 00:11:46.080
Not this again.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.039
You take the lion's share every time.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.440
What's the point of competing?

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.759
Who can beat you anyway?

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.360
I want to join in too.

00:11:53.679 --> 00:11:54.840
Young Master Fan.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.519
You have a wealthy family and a big business.

00:11:56.679 --> 00:11:57.519
Why do you want to fight for food...

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.440
...with us folks who live hand to mouth?

00:11:59.759 --> 00:12:02.919
Eldest Brother leads us in the jianghu...

00:12:02.919 --> 00:12:04.840
...to uphold justice and chivalry.

00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:06.639
He set a rule long ago.

00:12:07.039 --> 00:12:08.320
For every job we pull...

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.240
...we must help a poor person.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.960
Today, I represent...

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:13.519
Granny Wang.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:14.840
Well said.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.559
We can't forget the rules.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.039
When roaming the jianghu...

00:12:18.159 --> 00:12:19.279
...what is most important?

00:12:19.399 --> 00:12:20.759
Honor.

00:12:22.519 --> 00:12:24.080
Honor is the most important thing.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.679
Your grandnephew...

00:12:25.679 --> 00:12:27.240
...is thirty-seven or thirty-eight.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.399
That's his nominal age, nominal age.

00:12:31.639 --> 00:12:33.159
He is the sole heir of the family.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.159
You want him to focus on his studies...

00:12:36.679 --> 00:12:38.480
...but who knew that Young Master Fan...

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.480
...is a bit too fond of playing?

00:12:39.559 --> 00:12:41.799
He causes trouble from morning till night.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.279
Find me someone fierce.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.320
Rumor has it that the Young Master has a "hard fate."

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.639
His parents at home...

00:12:49.639 --> 00:12:51.279
...were all cursed to death by him.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.440
I've introduced seven or eight girls to him...

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.200
...but none of them worked out.

00:12:58.279 --> 00:12:59.600
Then find someone even fiercer.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.279
I, Matchmaker Tian...

00:13:04.279 --> 00:13:06.360
...am quite famous in this town.

00:13:06.759 --> 00:13:08.519
If you think there's no way...

00:13:08.519 --> 00:13:09.960
...that's not entirely true.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.440
It's just that...

00:13:12.679 --> 00:13:14.320
Find me someone who can control him.

00:13:16.039 --> 00:13:18.399
I just thought of the perfect person.

00:13:18.799 --> 00:13:20.240
I'll go talk to them right away.

00:13:37.559 --> 00:13:39.000
You're pretty good.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.080
You son of a turtle.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.639
Come on then.

00:13:52.919 --> 00:13:53.720
What happened?

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.600
I practiced exactly according to

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.440
the book you sold me, didn't I?

00:13:59.679 --> 00:14:00.679
So where exactly

00:14:00.879 --> 00:14:01.879
did I lose?

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:03.679
This *True Spirit Sutra*...

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.960
the most important thing is the "Spirit".

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.519
There are spirits in the heavens,

00:14:07.679 --> 00:14:08.559
spirits in the earth,

00:14:08.759 --> 00:14:10.039
and spirits among men.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.879
As for the spirits among men,

00:14:12.919 --> 00:14:14.480
it depends on you,

00:14:14.679 --> 00:14:16.320
what kind of "spirit" you can realize.

00:14:17.919 --> 00:14:18.759
A born fool.

00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:09.519
Young Master, Young Master, Young Master!

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:10.799
It's terrible!

00:15:10.799 --> 00:15:12.039
Something big has happened!

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.240
Granduncle!

00:15:15.639 --> 00:15:18.399
I won't go through with this marriage!

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.360
I'd rather die than marry!

00:15:25.159 --> 00:15:26.639
Why aren't you hitting me?

00:15:27.519 --> 00:15:28.480
Young Master,

00:15:28.759 --> 00:15:30.360
you've been dry-wailing for so long,

00:15:30.759 --> 00:15:32.399
but you haven't wailed the Old Master out here.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.279
If you don't hit me, how can I wail?

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.399
Hit me.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.240
You're more ruthless than Granduncle.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.559
You told me to hit hard!

00:15:53.159 --> 00:15:54.799
Hitting me like this,

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.320
I might as well ask Granduncle to hit me.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.519
Then ask him to come hit you.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.320
But he won't come out.

00:16:00.679 --> 00:16:01.279
Go find him then.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:03.519
Young Master,

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:04.879
if you hit me

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.960
and it means you don't have to marry,

00:16:07.639 --> 00:16:08.559
then hit hard.

00:16:13.919 --> 00:16:16.679
You can't escape what's coming.

00:16:17.039 --> 00:16:17.720
Let's go.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:32.799
Granduncle.

00:16:34.159 --> 00:16:34.960
I know.

00:16:35.799 --> 00:16:37.159
You want me to come here

00:16:37.159 --> 00:16:38.639
and admit my mistake to the ancestors.

00:16:39.879 --> 00:16:40.639
Fan Bao.

00:16:41.279 --> 00:16:43.000
In front of the ancestors,

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.600
hit me hard.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.159
After the beating,

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.399
I won't have to go through with this marriage.

00:16:48.639 --> 00:16:49.600
Hit me!

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.159
Enough.

00:16:53.919 --> 00:16:55.240
Enough!

00:16:55.519 --> 00:16:57.200
Stop the charade.

00:16:57.759 --> 00:16:59.000
This marriage,

00:16:59.679 --> 00:17:00.799
is set in stone.

00:17:01.159 --> 00:17:02.120
Granduncle, I...

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.399
I really know I was wrong.

00:17:03.399 --> 00:17:04.519
Really.

00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:07.360
I promise the ancestors,

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.840
I won't go out and cause trouble anymore.

00:17:09.919 --> 00:17:11.400
Forcing me to marry

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.519
is driving me to my death!

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:23.440
Either you get married,

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.000
or I'll lie in there right now.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.599
Boss Liu, congratulations!

00:17:36.599 --> 00:17:37.400
Congratulations.

00:17:37.799 --> 00:17:40.119
Elder Wang, Elder Wang.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.000
An auspicious cloud blooms in the east,

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.960
a purple cloud arrives from the west.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.599
Auspicious and purple clouds meet,

00:17:50.119 --> 00:17:55.400
the bride and groom come to bow.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.480
First bow to Heaven and Earth!

00:18:00.799 --> 00:18:02.279
Bow to Heaven and Earth!

00:18:11.079 --> 00:18:12.839
Second bow to Granduncle!

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.599
Bow to Granduncle!

00:18:19.519 --> 00:18:21.359
Husband and wife bow to each other!

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.200
Enter the bridal chamber!

00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:35.960
What do I do?

00:18:36.519 --> 00:18:38.200
I can't take your place.

00:18:38.799 --> 00:18:41.480
Granduncle! Granduncle!

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.720
If you want to tie me down,

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.319
find a better rope!

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.720
I'm clearly a Golden Arhat,

00:18:48.759 --> 00:18:51.599
but you insist on matching me with patched-up clothes!

00:18:53.119 --> 00:18:54.480
I'm going to study!

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.680
There's no escaping this.

00:19:00.799 --> 00:19:02.680
I'll go in and call her Grandma,

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.200
and let her live with Granduncle!

00:19:15.279 --> 00:19:16.160
Let me tell you something

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.880
I don't have any money

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.599
The money all belongs to Granduncle

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.519
Why don't you marry Granduncle?

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.039
Our Granduncle...

00:19:23.359 --> 00:19:25.200
...has been single for decades

00:19:25.759 --> 00:19:27.599
Like aged wine, he's pure essence

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.240
Plenty of middle-aged ladies have their eyes on him

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.000
You wouldn't be losing out

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.599
You really are a Simpleton

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.599
I may be silly...

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.480
...but Granduncle isn't

00:19:40.359 --> 00:19:42.160
Stop talking nonsense

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.240
Good heavens!

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.400
I thought you were... that person

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:14.720
Who is "that person"?

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.839
I have a name. It's Yu Zhen

00:20:18.599 --> 00:20:19.759
You should call me Grandma

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.000
I'm not that stupid

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:27.640
I have a tough fate

00:20:28.039 --> 00:20:28.920
Aren't you afraid?

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:29.519
No

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.200
I'm even harder than you

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.240
I'm here to discipline you on Granduncle's behalf

00:20:38.119 --> 00:20:40.160
I'm willing to let you handle me

00:20:42.359 --> 00:20:43.519
Didn't you say...

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.079
...you wanted to study?

00:20:46.119 --> 00:20:47.039
I am studying

00:20:49.119 --> 00:20:49.720
Today...

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.240
...I'm going to study the book of "you"

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.240
In broad daylight?

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.720
People outside can see us

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.240
What's there to be afraid of?

00:20:56.359 --> 00:20:57.839
We're legally married

00:20:57.839 --> 00:20:59.039
Who cares?

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.000
I've stumbled right into paradise

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.400
Just my dumb luck

00:21:08.039 --> 00:21:10.039
My father was a schoolteacher

00:21:10.039 --> 00:21:10.920
He passed away early

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.920
I used to have an older brother

00:21:13.279 --> 00:21:14.759
He also fell ill and died

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.400
Leaving just my mother and me to rely on each other

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.839
She just wanted me to marry into a good family

00:21:21.519 --> 00:21:23.319
I really thank your mother

00:21:28.799 --> 00:21:30.440
Just as I'm getting emotional, you son of a...

00:21:32.839 --> 00:21:34.039
Come and catch me!

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.400
Come and catch me!

00:21:46.519 --> 00:21:47.519
Where did this stray cat come from?

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:48.839
Is it in heat?

00:21:58.039 --> 00:22:01.000
Zhongjiang black pork with garlic sauce

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.039
Here

00:22:05.799 --> 00:22:07.039
You're quite the cook

00:22:30.319 --> 00:22:31.119
Wait a moment

00:22:31.279 --> 00:22:32.839
You still need to wash your face

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.559
You really are a Simpleton

00:22:44.359 --> 00:22:45.200
Yu Zhen

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.519
I've got it all nice and warm

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.119
Come up here, quick

00:22:58.039 --> 00:22:58.839
Is it warm?

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:00.960
It can get even warmer

00:23:02.799 --> 00:23:05.640
Guidelines for Students, the Sages' teachings

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.480
Guidelines for Students, the Sages' teachings

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.640
First be filial, next be trustworthy

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.440
First be filial, next be trustworthy

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.839
Love everyone, draw near to virtue

00:23:19.119 --> 00:23:21.799
Love everyone, draw near to virtue

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.400
If energy remains, then study the arts

00:23:26.599 --> 00:23:29.359
If energy remains, then study the arts

00:23:31.559 --> 00:23:33.119
Study hard now

00:23:33.359 --> 00:23:34.160
Alright

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.440
Let me tell you...

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.640
...you have to memorize it

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.440
You got it

00:23:48.599 --> 00:23:51.880
Finally, I am worthy of the Fan family's

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:54.359
ancestors.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.279
Division Commander Liao,

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.480
I really am a fortune teller!

00:24:03.279 --> 00:24:04.960
Well, uh, well...

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.480
Right now, Sichuan is divided into three factions.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.200
Those capable of assisting a wise ruler,

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.759
like the Sleeping Dragon and Phoenix, are rare.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.119
I can help you find a lucky general

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.480
who can strategize and execute grand plans.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:16.559
You?

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.240
No, no, no.

00:24:17.319 --> 00:24:18.799
I've been observing the stars these past few nights.

00:24:18.799 --> 00:24:20.920
I discovered a lucky general not seen in a century.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.559
He is the incarnation of the Wisdom Star.

00:24:22.559 --> 00:24:23.559
Skilled in both literary and martial arts.

00:24:23.559 --> 00:24:24.640
Brave and resourceful.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.960
It's a pity he's still lost among the common folk.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.480
He is currently undergoing eighty-one tribulations.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:29.880
Is he a monkey?

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:31.680
He was actually born in the Year of the Monkey.

00:24:32.319 --> 00:24:33.759
Commander, Commander, Commander!

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:35.400
You are a hero of these chaotic times.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.680
If you wish to achieve supremacy,

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.200
you must have a lucky general to assist you.

00:24:40.119 --> 00:24:40.920
Fine.

00:24:41.519 --> 00:24:42.839
I will trust you this one time.

00:24:43.039 --> 00:24:44.680
Finding someone takes time and effort.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.000
I'm afraid one can't make bricks without straw.

00:24:47.039 --> 00:24:47.920
What do you mean?

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:49.799
Could you...

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.359
give me a deposit?

00:24:51.559 --> 00:24:53.079
Your life is the deposit.

00:25:07.079 --> 00:25:07.960
I'm off then!

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.359
Since you've been behaving yourself lately,

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.359
Granduncle has asked you to go collect debts.

00:25:15.599 --> 00:25:16.720
It wasn't easy for the old man

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.680
to lift your grounding.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.839
Make sure you don't cause any more trouble.

00:25:20.079 --> 00:25:20.880
Got it.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.359
Where are you going?

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.759
Young Master Fan, ever since you got married,

00:25:37.359 --> 00:25:38.720
you haven't stepped out the door once.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.559
Doesn't he miss his brothers?

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.319
Damn men, after they get married,

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.440
are they all like this?

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.599
You wouldn't understand.

00:25:48.519 --> 00:25:49.359
Brother Fan!

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:50.480
Young Master Fan!

00:25:50.599 --> 00:25:51.400
Brother Fan!

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.559
What are you guys doing here?

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.759
We've finally waited you out.

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.240
Oh no.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.440
What's the matter?

00:26:05.119 --> 00:26:06.279
Yu Zhen!

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.000
Yu Zhen!

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.400
I forgot to tell you something important!

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.440
What is it?

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.880
That boil on your butt...

00:26:17.039 --> 00:26:18.599
make sure you remember to apply the ointment.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.640
And don't sit on any hard benches!

00:26:21.799 --> 00:26:22.960
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.400
You have to walk the road with your feet.

00:26:24.519 --> 00:26:25.920
You know how to do that, right?

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:27.880
Hurry up and go.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.440
Simpleton!

00:26:33.799 --> 00:26:34.720
Come back!

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.200
I'm back.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.519
Say whatever you have to say all at once,

00:26:39.319 --> 00:26:41.319
so you don't have to run back all sweaty.

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:43.400
That's it, that's it.

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:45.599
Hurry back.

00:26:47.519 --> 00:26:48.319
I'm off!

00:26:53.839 --> 00:26:54.359
Coming!

00:26:54.359 --> 00:26:55.200
Coming, coming!

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.799
In this vast world,

00:27:05.119 --> 00:27:06.480
isn't brotherhood the greatest?

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:12.279
Yes!

00:27:12.319 --> 00:27:13.119
The mountains are high,

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.039
the waters are deep,

00:27:14.279 --> 00:27:15.880
but isn't brotherhood the deepest?

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:17.359
Yes!

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.559
Your brother's life or death—

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:20.920
do you still care about it?

00:27:21.039 --> 00:27:23.920
People of the Jianghu never flake out!

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.559
You sure are living it up.

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.319
While us brothers are starving to death.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.799
So hungry I'm tripping over my own feet.

00:27:40.319 --> 00:27:41.519
Falling flat on my face.

00:27:42.759 --> 00:27:44.640
I'm like a monk's head, too.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.279
I've got no way out.

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:49.799
Once I collect the debts...

00:27:50.119 --> 00:27:51.119
We'll discuss it then.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:52.519
Collecting debts?

00:27:52.839 --> 00:27:53.920
Why didn't you say you were collecting debts?

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.319
You should've asked the brothers to back you up!

00:27:56.119 --> 00:27:57.519
Even if it's a mountain of blades or a sea of fire...

00:27:57.519 --> 00:27:58.960
We brothers will go with you.

00:27:58.960 --> 00:27:59.920
Let's go, together. Let's go.

00:28:01.079 --> 00:28:03.039
Piping hot mutton soup!

00:28:03.039 --> 00:28:04.559
Come and get it!

00:28:06.119 --> 00:28:08.839
Authentic Weiyuan mutton soup!

00:28:08.839 --> 00:28:09.680
Boss.

00:28:10.039 --> 00:28:12.480
I'm here to collect the rent for these past few months.

00:28:13.279 --> 00:28:13.920
You want more soup?

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:14.559
Coming right up!

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.799
Coming, coming, coming!

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.079
Here you go.

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.559
Fill it up, fill it up!

00:28:19.839 --> 00:28:21.200
Here, here, here.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:21.960
What the heck are you doing?

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.000
It's brim-full already!

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.799
It doesn't cost anything, honestly.

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:26.880
Pay the rent.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.400
The bill?

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.720
Coming, coming, coming!

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:31.559
Stand still!

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.440
Are you paying or not?

00:28:34.799 --> 00:28:35.839
Young Master Fan.

00:28:35.839 --> 00:28:37.559
You can see I'm busy right now.

00:28:37.599 --> 00:28:38.640
It's not like I won't pay you.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.839
Just come back another day.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:40.720
If you don't pay today...

00:28:41.359 --> 00:28:43.319
It'll be like threshing grain in the rain.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.960
It won't end well.

00:28:45.599 --> 00:28:46.440
What are you doing?

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:48.599
You want to hit me?

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.599
Let me tell you.

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:51.839
They call me "One Touch Fall" around here.

00:28:52.039 --> 00:28:54.279
If you knock me over...

00:28:54.319 --> 00:28:55.839
Not only will you not get the rent...

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:56.960
My three wives...

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:57.720
And eight kids...

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:58.640
You'll have to support them all.

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.519
Here we come, here we come!

00:29:03.519 --> 00:29:03.960
Let's go.

00:29:05.759 --> 00:29:06.599
Go, go, go.

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:07.279
Stop eating!

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.480
That mutton soup...

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.880
It only tastes good with some wine added.

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:11.759
Come on, come on.

00:29:12.319 --> 00:29:13.119
Pay up.

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:14.599
Does it taste good?

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:15.559
Let me have a sip.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.039
Boss, do something!

00:29:18.039 --> 00:29:19.039
Do what? I can't do anything!

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:20.279
The boss is treating everyone today!

00:29:20.279 --> 00:29:21.279
Go, go, go!

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:21.920
No need to pay!

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:23.519
No, no!

00:29:24.599 --> 00:29:25.960
You guys are wrecking my business!

00:29:26.319 --> 00:29:27.119
I'm going to report you to the authorities!

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.400
Go ahead and report it!

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.039
I'll sue you right back...

00:29:30.119 --> 00:29:31.039
For owing money and not paying!

00:29:31.599 --> 00:29:32.279
Let's go!

00:29:32.359 --> 00:29:33.440
It's even livelier inside!

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.000
Go, go, go!

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:34.920
You can't, you can't!

00:29:36.079 --> 00:29:38.319
I'll pay, I'll pay!

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.400
See?

00:29:41.599 --> 00:29:42.720
When the brothers step in...

00:29:42.799 --> 00:29:43.880
Instant success.

00:29:44.319 --> 00:29:45.160
So, what do you say?

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.960
You should treat everyone to a meat meal.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:48.519
This...

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.920
I have to hand this over to Granduncle.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.599
I need to make a good impression.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.759
Your wife has only been here a few days...

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.279
And you've already forgotten our brotherhood?

00:29:56.319 --> 00:29:56.920
Exactly!

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:57.400
Heartbreaking.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.039
My heart aches.

00:29:58.039 --> 00:29:59.519
It hurts deep down in my soul.

00:30:00.039 --> 00:30:00.720
You've changed.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.480
You're no longer the...

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.000
Righteous and loyal Young Master Fan.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.359
Saying that about Young Master Fan...

00:30:06.359 --> 00:30:08.279
Is like weighing manure in the toilet.

00:30:08.319 --> 00:30:09.240
That's too much!

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.400
But the brothers helped you with all their hearts.

00:30:12.759 --> 00:30:13.680
Giving a little kickback...

00:30:14.119 --> 00:30:14.920
Isn't too much to ask, is it?

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:17.720
How much do you want?

00:30:34.319 --> 00:30:35.640
Let's go. Next one.

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:36.519
Let's go.

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.480
How much is it exactly?

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:39.720
I'm not telling you.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.359
Young Master Fan.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.480
Whatever catches your eye here...

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.519
Just take whatever you want.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.240
If you want me to pay rent...

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:46.640
I can't cough up the cash.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.440
What do you mean you can't cough it up?

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.640
How about this?

00:30:51.839 --> 00:30:53.519
I'll forge you a handy weapon...

00:30:53.759 --> 00:30:54.759
To cover the rent.

00:30:58.039 --> 00:30:58.839
You just...

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.240
Make me something I want to pay off the debt.

00:31:01.799 --> 00:31:02.519
What is it?

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:06.680
This.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.200
Is exactly what I want most.

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:10.799
What's the use of this?

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.440
None of your damn business.

00:31:17.319 --> 00:31:18.160
Pay up.

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.200
Young Master Fan.

00:31:20.799 --> 00:31:22.960
Business has been terrible.

00:31:23.319 --> 00:31:24.640
I really can't afford the rent.

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:26.839
So what do we do?

00:31:27.359 --> 00:31:27.880
How about...

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.519
I give you my son as payment?

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:30.559
As a bodyguard...

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:31.480
Or to carry your bags.

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:32.640
He can do anything.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.039
You're giving me this beanpole?

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.480
If it were a woman...

00:31:36.759 --> 00:31:37.880
We might consider it.

00:31:38.759 --> 00:31:39.880
Look at him.

00:31:40.039 --> 00:31:41.079
What can he actually do?

00:31:46.319 --> 00:31:47.119
Dad, watch this.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.480
That's actually pretty impressive.

00:32:01.079 --> 00:32:03.240
He's good enough to tag along for a meal.

00:32:03.759 --> 00:32:05.400
Another mouth to feed?

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.240
Just look at him.

00:32:07.359 --> 00:32:09.200
A dried shrimp like him won't eat much.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.160
Hurry up!

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.200
Thank you, Young Master Fan!

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.519
Thank you, Young Master Fan!

00:32:15.079 --> 00:32:16.160
Perform a special skill...

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.680
And you can pay off the rent.

00:32:36.119 --> 00:32:36.920
This is great.

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:57.960
I used to be the baby of the group.

00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:59.559
Now that a new brother has joined...

00:32:59.559 --> 00:33:00.640
I'm still the baby.

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:01.960
I'm not having it.

00:33:02.519 --> 00:33:04.079
Emperors love the eldest son.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.519
Commoners love the youngest son.

00:33:06.359 --> 00:33:07.960
Debt collecting turned into scrap collecting.

00:33:08.119 --> 00:33:09.240
Only you could pull that off.

00:33:10.519 --> 00:33:12.839
They really couldn't pay up.

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.359
The cut for the brothers...

00:33:14.359 --> 00:33:16.359
Is less than the fat on a chicken leg.

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:17.720
We probably need a raise.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:20.640
Yeah, two more mouths to feed.

00:33:21.519 --> 00:33:23.240
The brothers have risked their lives for you.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:25.319
You value loyalty the most.

00:33:25.759 --> 00:33:27.160
You gotta give us a raise.

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.119
I'll take you to the opera.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:31.960
To satisfy your craving.

00:33:32.319 --> 00:33:35.160
Our Master Wen's "Guiying Hunting Geese"...

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.160
He sings it beautifully.

00:33:52.279 --> 00:33:53.640
Why isn't the show on?

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:57.119
Paying back debts

00:33:57.119 --> 00:33:58.559
is the law of nature.

00:34:00.319 --> 00:34:02.200
I've been here so many damn times.

00:34:02.319 --> 00:34:04.279
You really won't show Scarface any respect?

00:34:05.359 --> 00:34:05.960
Sir.

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.640
My husband is so sick.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.920
Let's talk outside.

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:16.760
Our family really has no money left.

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:18.840
All the money went to treating his illness.

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.840
Just give me two more days of grace.

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.760
My money comes from three knives and six holes,

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.639
dug out of a basin of blood.

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:25.679
If you don't pay,

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.360
I can't report back to my boss either.

00:34:27.559 --> 00:34:28.760
What's going on? What's going on?

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.719
What a racket.

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:32.079
Master Wen, come here.

00:34:32.559 --> 00:34:33.679
Collecting debts owed.

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:34.760
Mind your own business and crawl away.

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.159
Only turtles crawl.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:37.760
Why don't you crawl for me to see?

00:34:38.039 --> 00:34:39.760
Whose belt wasn't tied tight,

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.519
that let you bastards loose?

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:42.559
Asking for a beating.

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:43.599
Who are you?

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.360
It's spacious outside. Come on.

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:46.320
Let's go.

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:47.519
Come on, come on, let's go.

00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:48.199
Move.

00:34:48.559 --> 00:34:49.480
Who's afraid of whom?

00:34:49.599 --> 00:34:50.360
Come on then.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:51.440
Stay here.

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.960
I think you're swatting flies on a tiger's head.

00:34:59.119 --> 00:35:00.400
Tired of living.

00:35:00.519 --> 00:35:02.039
Drawing a circle on two sheets of paper...

00:35:02.039 --> 00:35:02.880
You have such a big face.

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.440
With a little topknot on your head,

00:35:04.679 --> 00:35:05.840
you think you're taller than me?

00:35:06.159 --> 00:35:07.840
You're a worm fighting a rooster.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:08.679
You're looking to die.

00:35:08.679 --> 00:35:09.199
Come on.

00:35:09.239 --> 00:35:09.639
Come on.

00:35:09.719 --> 00:35:10.199
Come on.

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:10.800
Bring it on.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.360
I don't have time to waste with you.

00:35:15.079 --> 00:35:15.920
Scram.
