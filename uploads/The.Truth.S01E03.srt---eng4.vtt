=Episode 3=

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.669
Jiang Lianhong, take a look.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.669
I said she looked like...

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.270
He Jie.

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.669
You mean

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:28.669
the He Jie you raped 20 years ago?

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.470
What's He Jie's

00:01:32.589 --> 00:01:34.270
connection to Jiang Honghai?

00:01:36.589 --> 00:01:38.270
I've told you everything I know.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.029
Go arrest him.

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:40.669
Why do you keep questioning me?

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.070
Then let's start with this.

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.990
Who is this?

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.309
It's too blurry. I can't see clearly.

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:00.669
What?

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.584
You forgot who you ate with that day?

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:05.470
Jiang Han.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.869
Does he know Jiang Honghai too?

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:09.709
We're from the same village.

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:10.350
He's a mason.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.870
He referred all the masons.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.470
Why didn't you mention it earlier?

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:15.549
I didn't know he was involved in this.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.709
Check this guy out.

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:27.829
What's Jiang Honghai's

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.509
connection to the rape case

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:30.590
22 years ago?

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.989
That day, a lot of police
came to my place.

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:36.709
All there to arrest me.

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.669
They said I got a young girl

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:39.829
pregnant.

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:41.829
But I never did it.

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.470
I didn't even know her.

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.870
But that kid described everything
about me clearly.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.150
She even had my underwear.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.509
I only found out later

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.989
that Honghai was behind that.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.709
It was all planned.

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.269
You're saying

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.870
Jiang Honghai and He Jie

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.070
colluded to frame you?

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.310
Not just them.

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:18.310
Honghai's dad too.

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:20.870
And my own dad.

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.549
Then why would the victim
falsely accuse you?

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:26.590
Honghai was 25 that year.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.030
He got her pregnant

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.630
and secretly took her
to get an abortion.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.034
He Jie's parents called the police.

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:36.070
Honghai couldn't go to jail.

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:39.789
So he and He Jie

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.549
threw the blame on me

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.350
while his dad came to see my dad.

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:51.430
His dad was a village official.

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.630
He turned everyone against me.

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:57.509
Even the police were fooled.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.229
My family couldn't fight them.

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:01.669
Later, he gave us 20,000 yuan

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:03.590
and an acre of land.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.630
(My dad told me...)

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.790
"Son,

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.990
just admit it."

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.630
She's all settled in.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.430
Don't worry.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.550
We almost caught him.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.750
I should've anticipated his next move.

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:54.149
His target has been Chen Xiaomeng.

00:04:56.269 --> 00:04:57.870
Calm down.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.469
How can I calm down?

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.589
He almost succeeded.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.070
He's a murderer, a rapist.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:05.949
As I've already said,

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:07.870
we've sent people
to protect Chen Xiaomeng.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:09.389
Let's head back.

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:11.070
Captain Leng might have new leads.

00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:13.230
Let's go. I'll drive.

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:20.310
Let's go.

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:42.589
Captain Leng.

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:45.349
We got something.

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:48.070
Jiang Han, 40 years old,
no prior record.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:49.589
He also grew up in the village.

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:51.550
He's around the same age
as Jiang Lianhong.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.269
He teaches at a mason training school

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:55.190
and helps young villagers find work.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.349
Bring Jiang Han in immediately.

00:05:57.949 --> 00:05:59.349
See if we can get

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:00.589
new leads from him.

00:06:00.829 --> 00:06:02.750
Focus on finding Jiang Honghai.

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:04.070
Yes, sir. I'm on it.

00:06:05.131 --> 00:06:07.864
(Ye Qian: Chen Xiaomeng is safe.)

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.990
Should be here.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.750
Jiang Han?

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.349
City Police Department.

00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:25.389
A few questions.

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:28.349
I'm just a trainer.

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:30.310
Conditions in our village aren't good.

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:32.870
Many young guys rely on this skill

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:33.949
to make a living.

00:06:34.328 --> 00:06:35.990
(Yunxi Police)
Did you refer Jiang Lianhong too?

00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:37.790
Jiang Lianhong?

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.230
We do manual labor,

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.230
but jobs aren't easy to find now.

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:47.509
But he got lucky.

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:48.870
Met some good people.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.790
Someone pulled strings
to pay his training fees.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.709
Later on,

00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:54.709
they even gave him jobs
on construction sites.

00:06:55.829 --> 00:06:56.949
Who was that person?

00:06:57.509 --> 00:06:58.310
Jiang Honghai.

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.990
His family used to be
in the renovation business.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.750
They're pretty well-off.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.509
His dad used to be a village official.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.110
Most of the fishponds

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:07.589
in our village belong to his family.

00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:09.149
Right.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:10.430
Honghai has this habit.

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:12.990
He loves making soup
with live brood fish.

00:07:13.469 --> 00:07:14.349
Says it's nourishing.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:15.990
He has it every single day.

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:18.550
So, he always keeps
a fish tank where he lives.

00:07:19.269 --> 00:07:20.509
Every few days,

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.230
he has his family
deliver fresh brood fish to him.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.949
You may not know.

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:26.709
Brood fish are really expensive.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:28.829
Luckily, his family has fishponds.

00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:31.550
Or who could've afforded that?

00:07:32.331 --> 00:07:32.990
(Yunxi Police)

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.310
On May 25th,

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.430
where were you
between 10 PM and midnight?

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:38.750
May 25th?

00:07:39.149 --> 00:07:39.949
Let me think.

00:07:41.349 --> 00:07:43.430
That night,
I was drinking at a restaurant.

00:07:44.149 --> 00:07:45.750
Who were you drinking with?

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.670
Jiang Lianhong and Jiang Honghai.

00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:50.790
But Jiang Honghai can't hold his liquor.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.190
He was clamoring to leave before 11 PM.

00:07:53.349 --> 00:07:55.149
I drank for a bit longer
and then left too.

00:07:55.149 --> 00:07:56.829
Didn't pay attention to the exact time.

00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:59.589
Did you see Jiang Honghai again
after that?

00:08:00.029 --> 00:08:00.750
No.

00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:03.670
Besides home and construction sites,

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:04.550
does Jiang Honghai

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:05.750
have any other places to stay?

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:09.469
Jiang Honghai is a strange one.

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:11.070
He's used to keeping to himself.

00:08:12.389 --> 00:08:15.269
But I have a storage warehouse.

00:08:15.949 --> 00:08:17.630
A year ago, he asked me for its key

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.630
and wanted to keep
construction equipment there.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:21.430
He hasn't returned the key yet.

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:23.389
Where is that warehouse?

00:08:23.949 --> 00:08:25.469
28, North Xinyuan Lane.

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:27.389
In the abandoned place
by the noodle shop.

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:41.109
We got something.

00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:43.829
Jiang Honghai also drank
with them that night.

00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:44.709
And he left first.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:45.629
Wang Tong,

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:46.872
share the address.

00:08:46.872 --> 00:08:47.430
Yes.

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.989
Let's go.

00:09:12.749 --> 00:09:13.510
Master,

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:15.510
this building's abandoned.

00:09:15.749 --> 00:09:16.869
Lights on the second floor.

00:09:16.869 --> 00:09:18.070
Target is likely there.

00:09:18.749 --> 00:09:19.550
Standard procedure.

00:09:19.709 --> 00:09:20.390
Wang Tong.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:21.510
- You take point.
- Okay.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:22.270
You provide backup.

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:23.790
We secure the perimeter.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:06.390
Get down.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.709
Don't move.

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:34.109
Jiang Lianhong wanted to cover for you

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:36.629
and take the blame for you.

00:11:37.589 --> 00:11:38.430
Did you know that?

00:11:42.829 --> 00:11:43.390
He...

00:11:45.869 --> 00:11:46.869
he might have been

00:11:48.469 --> 00:11:49.469
doing it for his dad.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:55.352
(Dual usage of devices
is strictly prohibited)

00:11:56.829 --> 00:11:59.229
Why protect Jiang Honghai?

00:12:05.589 --> 00:12:07.229
My dad has uremia.

00:12:07.749 --> 00:12:08.709
He needs dialysis.

00:12:10.109 --> 00:12:11.109
I had no choice.

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:15.349
Once, when we were drunk,

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:17.510
he told me,

00:12:18.829 --> 00:12:19.709
"Lianhong,

00:12:20.229 --> 00:12:22.150
if anything ever happens to you,

00:12:23.469 --> 00:12:25.229
I'll take care of your dad
until the end."

00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:27.469
Well,

00:12:29.589 --> 00:12:30.550
my life is worthless.

00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:34.469
Whether I live or die doesn't matter.

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:37.550
Back then, you seduced He Jie

00:12:38.949 --> 00:12:40.510
and got her pregnant at just 13.

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:42.310
After her parents found out,

00:12:42.469 --> 00:12:44.070
you forced her to commit perjury

00:12:44.989 --> 00:12:47.510
and pinned all the blame
on Jiang Lianhong.

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:50.270
Now you've committed these three crimes.

00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:52.390
You've destroyed five families.

00:12:57.419 --> 00:13:02.264

you won't get away this time.

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:26.949

in the face of evidence.)

don't use landlines anymore.

Come on, have a drink with me.

00:27:11.349 --> 00:27:12.669
Another round.

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:16.510
Come on.

00:27:18.869 --> 00:27:19.829
Another one.

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:21.310
Come on.

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.768
Hello, you two.

00:27:28.568 --> 00:27:29.720
Right away.

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:43.270
You shouldn't have brought
your wife here.

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:44.990
We can't let loose.

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:50.070
I thought we were here
for business today.

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:56.189
Huo, famous across the Southwest,

00:27:56.189 --> 00:27:57.750
is actually henpecked?

00:27:58.149 --> 00:27:59.189
If this gets out,

00:28:00.669 --> 00:28:02.270
no one in our circle will believe it.

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:06.389
And from what I know,

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:08.829
your wife should be

00:28:08.829 --> 00:28:10.950
the young lady
of the Nanbang family, right?

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:15.790
Was that on purpose?

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:22.349
Don't bring up my ex-wife again.

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:23.990
Right, ex-wife.

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:30.189
So you lost your wife's family backing

00:28:30.589 --> 00:28:32.070
and couldn't operate there anymore?

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:34.470
That's why you want to move
into the Wannan market?

00:28:38.349 --> 00:28:41.109
The crackdowns over there
Have gotten stricter these years.

00:28:41.109 --> 00:28:42.149
Business is tough.

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:45.109
Plus, the market for the old goods
is shrinking.

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:46.869
I have to switch things up.

00:29:18.149 --> 00:29:19.030
It's on me.

00:29:27.389 --> 00:29:28.429
You don't trust us?

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:34.869
Huo, your reputation
has always been well-known.

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:37.950
But this is our first time
working together after all.

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:40.710
Caution is the parent of safety.

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:45.429
We have our own principles.

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:47.429
Business is business.

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:48.669
Flesh

00:29:49.629 --> 00:29:50.790
is something we don't touch.

00:29:55.629 --> 00:29:57.310
So, you won't give me any face?

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:00.629
I don't care about your rules.

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:02.629
This is Wannan.

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:04.869
If you want to get things done here,

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:06.869
you must play by our rules.

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:12.869
You're not cops, are you?

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:33.829
Old-timer,

00:30:34.669 --> 00:30:36.030
you've watched too many movies.

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:40.589
What era is this?

00:30:41.109 --> 00:30:42.710
You'll be ousted like this.

00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:44.510
Not touching flesh

00:30:45.629 --> 00:30:46.950
doesn't make us cops, right?

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:50.470
Truly sharp-tongued.

00:30:50.869 --> 00:30:52.990
You make it sound like
I'm pushing you too hard.

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:56.669
Since you won't give me any face,

00:30:57.349 --> 00:30:59.030
then there's no point
in working together.

00:31:04.869 --> 00:31:05.790
Sister-in-law,

00:31:07.429 --> 00:31:08.589
you make things complicated.

00:31:09.189 --> 00:31:10.470
What's wrong with using it?

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:13.750
I'll use.

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:48.109
What did you just call me?

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:51.109
Sister-in-law.

00:31:52.629 --> 00:31:53.950
What's our rule?

00:31:57.109 --> 00:31:59.270
We don't touch flesh.

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:01.230
Look at you.

00:32:02.109 --> 00:32:03.589
You've never quit, have you?

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:07.790
Breaking the rule knowingly.

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:10.109
Want out?

00:32:13.189 --> 00:32:14.470
But they were too arrogant.

00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:27.310
My apologies

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:29.429
for the drama.

00:32:30.829 --> 00:32:32.829
Since Mr. Bao doesn't want to cooperate,

00:32:33.149 --> 00:32:34.030
then

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:36.629
we'll take our leave.

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:50.950
Don't touch me.

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:16.030
We smashed up your place twice in a row.

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:17.790
My apologies.

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:29.710
Call Gui.

00:33:31.032 --> 00:33:33.656
(I miss you so much at Solo)

00:34:37.304 --> 00:34:37.990
You're here.

00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:38.629
Thanks.

00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:40.550
Have a seat.

00:34:41.269 --> 00:34:42.269
Why treat me again?

00:34:42.269 --> 00:34:43.669
You really don't have to.

00:34:44.309 --> 00:34:46.070
I looked for the person
you asked me to find.

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:47.269
At least within Yunxi City,

00:34:47.269 --> 00:34:48.990
I couldn't find any trace of her.

00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:52.990
Okay, thanks.

00:34:53.189 --> 00:34:55.709
Then, please just keep an eye out
for me whenever you can.

00:34:55.928 --> 00:34:56.536
(Ye Qian's friend)

00:34:56.536 --> 00:34:57.990
(Lawyer, Wannan Law Firm)
Who is Chen Yumo to you,

00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:59.070
that you'd go this far?

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:03.629
Someone very important to me.

00:35:05.629 --> 00:35:06.430
Let's eat.

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:09.269
Waiter, order please.

00:35:35.709 --> 00:35:37.589
Huo and Qing, you're here.

00:35:38.269 --> 00:35:39.229
Our boss

00:35:39.229 --> 00:35:40.870
has arranged this place for you.

00:35:41.149 --> 00:35:42.350
For the time being,

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:43.870
you can stay here peacefully.

00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:46.269
Here are the keys.

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:51.030
If you need anything,

00:35:51.149 --> 00:35:52.589
just tell me. I'm Qiang.

00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:54.109
Don't stand on ceremony at all.

00:35:57.229 --> 00:35:58.470
The decorations here

00:35:58.870 --> 00:36:00.669
aren't antiques
or cultural relics, are they?

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:03.390
Coming from a small town,

00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:04.709
we tend to be a bit clumsy.

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:07.950
We can't risk breaking
anything we can't afford.

00:36:09.749 --> 00:36:10.950
Qing, you're joking.

00:36:11.629 --> 00:36:13.470
With the goods you possess,

00:36:14.189 --> 00:36:15.269
you could buy anything.

00:36:17.189 --> 00:36:19.470
But we need the channels to cash them.

00:36:20.189 --> 00:36:22.749
That's exactly why we came
to find your boss' boss

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:23.830
for cooperation.

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:26.629
Don't worry about that.

00:36:27.229 --> 00:36:28.870
The place might be a bit old,

00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:30.390
but everything inside is new.

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:38.830
New wine in old bottles.

00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:40.870
Mr. Bao sure knows

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:43.709
how to keep up
appearances and substance.

with Bao Hei's side.

00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:58.030

arranged by Bao Hei.

along the southwest border.)

According to our CI,

(meth sales channels.)

00:37:21.749 --> 00:37:23.070
For the two gangs' cooperation,

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:24.550
given what we know now,
