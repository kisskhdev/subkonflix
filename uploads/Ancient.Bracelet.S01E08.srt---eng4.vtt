(That man in black shares
the same source of power as mine.)

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:55.166
(He even plotted
to separate me from Zhaoli.)

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.520
(It seems he knows my condition well.)

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.520
Ying Du.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.870
So, we're back in the tribe?

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.270
I'm sorry.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.790
I failed to protect you.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.960
It's fine.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.280
I'm not in pain.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:27.640
I know how much you hurt

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.680
better than anyone.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.960
Ying Du.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.190
Hold still.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.000
It'll sting a little.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.270
Ying Du,

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.280
I'd been wondering

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.130
why you always arrived just in time

00:02:06.143 --> 00:02:07.280
every time I got hurt.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.400
Only today did I realize

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.360
that when I'm hurt,
you feel the pain too.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.840
Is that really true?

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.960
So,

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.280
when you said you'd protect me,

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.430
it wasn't just because of the power.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.750
You also didn't want
to get hurt yourself.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.680
At first, that was true,

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.310
but later,

00:02:34.497 --> 00:02:35.586
every time you faced danger,

00:02:35.597 --> 00:02:36.690
it was always because of me.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.680
Today, to save me,

00:02:39.396 --> 00:02:40.623
you even nearly lost your life.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.080
Zhaoli,

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.190
I don't want you to be hurt ever again.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.440
Ying Du!

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.710
I'm here to save you!

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:53.750
Ying Du,

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.750
hang in there.

00:02:55.796 --> 00:02:57.176
You ran all the way here like that?

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.803
Were you not afraid of losing your life?

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.990
Zhaoli,

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.470
it was too dangerous today.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.470
From now on,
you must put yourself first.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.870
I can handle everything else.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.470
Since I made a pact with you,

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.680
I'm bound to help you.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.590
Is this only because of the pact?

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.630
Not entirely.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.470
Then...

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.200
Ying Du.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.240
Ying Du, what's wrong with you?

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:42.800
Ying Du!

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.910
Do you need to use your power?

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.040
Don't get me wrong.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.720
I only wish to heal your wounds.

Luo Cheng.

I have matters to report.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:29.240
He's here for you.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:32.670
Go now.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.350
Your Majesty,

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.750
I was worried. Your power had waned,

00:06:48.243 --> 00:06:49.716
so your grave injuries from yesterday

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.070
might not heal so soon.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.310
Yet you've recovered so well.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:54.490
It seems

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.120
Zhaoli must have tended to you
with care last night.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:03.060
Get to the matter.

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.240
I couldn't find anyone
who uses the same spells as you.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.070
His power is remarkably strong.

00:07:08.773 --> 00:07:10.446
Now, I share a spiritual link
with Zhaoli;

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.240
it's hard to say if I can match him.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.553
Your Majesty,

00:07:13.564 --> 00:07:15.673
that man lurking in the shadows
is far too dangerous.

(The top priority)

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.360
(is to find the man in black.)

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.240
Protect Zhaoli.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.600
Don't let her step outside,

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.070
and above all, keep her from harm.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.520
Yes.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.360
I am Oracle,

00:07:31.433 --> 00:07:32.870
well-versed in the past and present.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.160
There's nothing I don't know.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.240
May I ask what you seek to know?

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:38.560
Under what circumstances

00:07:38.866 --> 00:07:40.740
would two people's power
share the same origin?

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.480
I have, in fact,

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.430
heard of it before.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.190
Only the closest of blood kin,

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.920
parents or siblings,

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:54.000
may share the same power.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.870
No others could ever have it.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.360

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.040
(Why does my body suddenly burn
with restless heat?)

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:09.390
(Is Zhaoli...)

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:21.110
Zhaoli. (Support Admin Watch on

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:23.870
You're back?

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.240
You were waiting for me?

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:36.320
Why did you leave alone in daylight?

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.790
You even kept me inside

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.440
and left me till late at night.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.910
Don't leave me like that again.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.390
I fear harm may come to you.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.080
Zhaoli,

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.910
say that again.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.670
From now on, do not leave

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.840
without telling me.
