Aren't you going to eat lunch?

(Sunny Korean Medicine Clinic)

00:00:09.471 --> 00:00:11.371
Where did he go? He skipped breakfast, too.

00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:19.951
Have a seat, Grandpa.

00:00:21.881 --> 00:00:23.121
Are you protesting or something?

00:00:28.491 --> 00:00:29.861
Do my words mean nothing to you?

00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:33.361
Have you no shame, acting like this in front of your nephew? Pathetic.

00:00:33.531 --> 00:00:36.861
Fine, I'm pathetic. No wonder you voted for amazing Jeong Han.

00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:40.571
Good grief.

00:00:40.971 --> 00:00:42.841
What does he expect to accomplish by acting like that?

00:00:46.611 --> 00:00:47.771
Where did everyone go?

00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:51.181
- What about your aunt? - I don't know either.

00:00:51.711 --> 00:00:53.711
She just told me to make sure you two had lunch.

00:00:57.421 --> 00:01:01.451
Hey. It's not like he's the only one in the world selling that bag.

00:01:02.191 --> 00:01:04.861
Auntie, I'm telling you, it's a limited-edition Cabanel.

00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:08.131
Exactly. How many people do you think would be selling one?

00:01:09.231 --> 00:01:13.471
I'm so glad I added it to my watchlist on the resale app.

00:01:14.471 --> 00:01:15.601
What am I going to do?

00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:17.501
Will I be able to track him down?

00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:22.141
- What if he sees me and runs? - Don't worry, Auntie.

00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:25.011
Because I'll be the bait.

00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:29.481
Dong Suk, I can run 100m in 15.2 seconds.

00:01:29.581 --> 00:01:31.481
And I'm wearing sneakers today.

00:01:42.261 --> 00:01:44.301
Hey, Woo Jae, it's Eun Bin.

00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:49.001
I wanted to keep my promise, even if it were the end of the world, but...

00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:53.211
I'm having a massive dopamine rush, and my heart's going into overdrive.

00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:56.281
Okay. I was just about to call you, actually.

00:01:57.111 --> 00:01:58.481
Something's come up on my end, too.

00:01:59.081 --> 00:02:00.081
Yes.

00:02:00.581 --> 00:02:02.051
Okay, let's talk later.

00:02:10.021 --> 00:02:11.021
But...

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:14.561
shouldn't Dae Han come with us, too?

00:02:16.901 --> 00:02:18.501
I'm worried she might be with some guy.

00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:20.571
Dae Han...

00:02:22.201 --> 00:02:23.471
I don't want him...

00:02:24.271 --> 00:02:25.671
to see that.

00:02:34.851 --> 00:02:38.391
Pharmacy's closed. Where's Mom? She isn't answering her phone.

00:02:39.621 --> 00:02:41.921
Nurse Oh, do you know anything?

00:02:42.491 --> 00:02:44.091
You know everything that goes on around here.

00:02:44.661 --> 00:02:45.731
That's just it.

00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:47.631
I'm surprised there's something I don't know.

00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:51.700
I feel like I'm the only one in the family...

00:02:51.701 --> 00:02:53.701
who doesn't know what's going on.

00:02:54.801 --> 00:02:58.271
Then it must be about me. So why am I in the dark?

00:02:58.471 --> 00:03:00.471
About you? What? Is something going on with you?

00:03:01.041 --> 00:03:02.081
Nothing.

00:03:03.081 --> 00:03:07.581
Is there a family group chat that doesn't include me?

00:03:07.851 --> 00:03:08.951
You never know.

00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:11.021
We're not that mean.

00:03:12.351 --> 00:03:13.951
But it's so weird.

00:03:14.491 --> 00:03:18.791
I have this gut feeling that something's going on.

00:03:19.161 --> 00:03:21.831
Then it's nothing. You have the worst intuition.

00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:23.361
The worst intuition?

00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:26.201
I guess my intuition isn't very good after all.

00:03:29.641 --> 00:03:31.101
Oh, this way.

00:03:36.381 --> 00:03:37.411
It's that way.

00:03:40.911 --> 00:03:44.021
I'll go meet him. You two hide, then grab him.

Got it?

00:03:45.821 --> 00:03:47.451
Where on earth are we?

00:03:48.021 --> 00:03:50.061
What's he doing in a completely random neighbourhood?

00:03:51.321 --> 00:03:52.761
Let's go, Dong Suk.

00:03:53.361 --> 00:03:55.901

Hey, that guy.

00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:06.371
Oh, my. Wait.

00:04:07.371 --> 00:04:08.981
Isn't he the son-in-law from the Korean medicine clinic?

What is it?

00:04:19.821 --> 00:04:20.821
Look.

00:04:24.061 --> 00:04:27.661
- This is it, right? - Dong Suk, over here!

00:04:29.131 --> 00:04:31.261
- What now? - If you go this way...

00:04:31.331 --> 00:04:32.331
Where is this place?

00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:36.071
I'll hold them off. You go first.

Hello.

We just turn here.

- I don't think this is it. - My gosh!

- Fancy seeing you here. - Mother!

Have you lost your mind? Why are you calling her "Mother?"

00:05:33.561 --> 00:05:36.031
Doctor, what brings you here?

00:05:38.101 --> 00:05:39.831
The public health center here...

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:42.841
asked me to run a mental health program.

00:05:43.471 --> 00:05:48.141
That's so admirable. Mother, it's good to see you here!

might you be going?

Excuse me?

Stay back. Don't follow me.

Stop right there.

Get away from me.

00:09:22.361 --> 00:09:25.021
Just how long have you been planning this?

It's been about three years.

00:09:30.201 --> 00:09:34.331
- Three years? - Yes. While visiting you,

00:09:34.401 --> 00:09:36.701
we started running into each other.

00:09:38.471 --> 00:09:39.641
Wait, so...

00:09:40.641 --> 00:09:43.341
is that why you agreed so quickly when I suggested we live together?

00:09:43.681 --> 00:09:47.151
Yes. I thought I'd see him more...

00:09:47.211 --> 00:09:49.851
He's a married man! The head of another household,

00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:51.481

You think he saw us and ran off?

00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:17.641
No. Ji Hu's dad has no connection to this neighbourhood.

For a man with a wife and child, is this how you should be acting?

00:10:57.521 --> 00:11:01.251
If you wanted to be with her, you should've divorced your wife.

00:11:01.821 --> 00:11:03.221
If you just run off like this,

00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:07.361
your family is left to wait forever without ever knowing why.

00:11:08.131 --> 00:11:10.261
How can you be so irresponsible?

00:11:12.271 --> 00:11:15.231
My mother-in-law is talking about herself.

00:11:17.241 --> 00:11:18.471
Look, Hui Gyeong.

00:11:18.971 --> 00:11:23.011
You of all people know the pain our family has lived with,

00:11:24.011 --> 00:11:26.011
so how could you do this to us?

00:11:26.481 --> 00:11:27.481
Us?

00:11:29.381 --> 00:11:30.881
There you go again, ganging up on me.

00:11:32.451 --> 00:11:35.991
- What? - You two always take the same side.

00:11:36.491 --> 00:11:39.331
You're the doctor she's so proud of, and she's a pharmacist.

00:11:39.761 --> 00:11:42.931
That's why I always felt singled out by you, Mother.

00:11:43.131 --> 00:11:44.131
What...

00:11:44.761 --> 00:11:47.131
Are you saying I discriminated against you?

00:11:47.201 --> 00:11:49.071
It's true! You looked down on me because I'm an orphan,

00:11:49.141 --> 00:11:50.541
and you always favoured her over me.

00:11:51.571 --> 00:11:52.641
Have you forgotten?

00:11:53.341 --> 00:11:56.441
I'm an orphan, too. My parents passed away,

00:11:56.511 --> 00:11:58.541
and I was raised by my grandmother before I married into this family.

00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:00.511
Right.

00:12:01.411 --> 00:12:03.081
- That's right. - So?

00:12:03.181 --> 00:12:05.991
You really think Mother played favourites?

00:12:06.391 --> 00:12:07.721
What have you ever done?

00:12:08.091 --> 00:12:10.621
Have you ever lifted a finger since you got married?

00:12:10.921 --> 00:12:14.831
Have you ever once cleaned your own room or bathroom?

00:12:15.161 --> 00:12:19.671
She supported your education, and this is the scheme you cook up?

00:12:20.031 --> 00:12:24.571
- What? You felt singled out? - You never did housework either!

00:12:24.641 --> 00:12:26.011
And did I have an affair?

00:12:26.071 --> 00:12:29.941
You and your husband always fight. You just pretend to be happy on TV.

00:12:30.311 --> 00:12:33.551
I'm better off choosing love than living a lie like you.

00:12:33.911 --> 00:12:38.421
How dare you cheat and talk of love in front of your mother-in-law?

00:12:39.491 --> 00:12:42.251
- She is no longer my mother-in-law. - Hey!

00:12:42.661 --> 00:12:45.561
Snap out of it! Are you divorced?

00:12:45.861 --> 00:12:48.731
You're an adulteress who cheated on her husband behind his back.

00:12:48.791 --> 00:12:50.801
And a homewrecker who destroyed another family!

00:12:52.931 --> 00:12:55.771
You're really scary. You look like you're going to hit me.

00:13:09.021 --> 00:13:12.451
Don't delude yourself into thinking he's going to love you forever.

00:13:12.921 --> 00:13:17.091
Someone who's cheated once is much more likely to do it again.

00:13:18.061 --> 00:13:19.391
You don't know what you're talking about.

00:13:19.731 --> 00:13:24.031
He's not like that. He said he had never cheated before.

00:13:24.261 --> 00:13:26.631
We truly love each other.

00:13:26.801 --> 00:13:30.671
He might be sweet to you now, caught in the thrill of the affair,

00:13:31.071 --> 00:13:35.041
but will he be responsible when he's married with a child?

00:13:36.481 --> 00:13:39.611
Darling. You're not going to abandon me, are you?

00:13:39.781 --> 00:13:41.651
No, of course not. Never.

00:13:42.981 --> 00:13:44.821
You will both go back to your homes.

00:13:45.221 --> 00:13:46.691
Get your divorces, then you can be together.

00:13:49.691 --> 00:13:53.131
- What if my husband won't agree? - I'll make him.

00:13:53.791 --> 00:13:57.631
Do as I say, or you'll have to hide. Otherwise, you both...

00:13:58.601 --> 00:14:01.171
will end up in court on theft charges.

00:14:03.441 --> 00:14:04.541
What happened here today...

00:14:05.341 --> 00:14:06.941
stays between us.

00:14:07.641 --> 00:14:10.241
Consider it a final courtesy...

00:14:10.641 --> 00:14:12.111
to the people who were once your family.

00:14:12.651 --> 00:14:14.981
Yes, I understand.

00:14:15.921 --> 00:14:16.981
In that case...

00:14:17.581 --> 00:14:20.321
So I can keep the security deposit and the savings?

00:14:21.221 --> 00:14:24.361
If you let me keep it, I'll agree to a clean divorce.

00:14:24.821 --> 00:14:25.991
If you don't,

00:14:26.331 --> 00:14:29.301
I'll tell everyone in town that I ran off with him.

00:14:29.801 --> 00:14:31.131
You really are...

00:14:31.531 --> 00:14:34.031
a terribly conniving person, aren't you?

00:14:41.871 --> 00:14:44.641
(Taehan)

00:14:46.951 --> 00:14:50.181
I haven't seen the Director around. Did he go eat somewhere else?

00:14:51.181 --> 00:14:53.191
He's probably busy with marketing.

00:14:53.691 --> 00:14:55.621
You haven't seen him since we got back, have you?

00:14:55.991 --> 00:14:58.091
What? No.

00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:01.891
It's good to see you again, Yang Hyun Bin.

00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:11.841
I've missed you, Gong Ju Ah.

00:15:23.621 --> 00:15:24.781
Hold on!

00:15:27.351 --> 00:15:31.591
Yes. I'm sorry. Sorry about that.

00:15:40.971 --> 00:15:42.571
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

00:16:00.451 --> 00:16:02.251
All right, Director. I'll be heading out.

00:16:02.561 --> 00:16:03.561
Okay.

00:16:07.191 --> 00:16:08.261
Hey, have you been busy?

00:16:08.891 --> 00:16:10.731
Oh, we're at the office... What was I thinking?

00:16:11.161 --> 00:16:12.331
Have you been busy, sir?

00:16:14.601 --> 00:16:17.641
Yes. I just came from a meeting with the marketing team.

00:16:18.071 --> 00:16:19.441
I see.

00:16:24.511 --> 00:16:25.911
I should get going.

00:16:25.981 --> 00:16:29.111
You were thrown off by Eun Bin yesterday, right?

00:16:29.651 --> 00:16:33.451
- The double in-laws part? - Yes, that "sister-in-law" thing.

00:16:34.491 --> 00:16:36.921
It's fine. I'm sure she was just joking.

00:16:37.521 --> 00:16:38.521
Yes, probably.

00:16:40.761 --> 00:16:44.401
I should really get going. I'm busy with the contest deadline.

00:16:44.661 --> 00:16:46.601
Right, go ahead. Good luck with your work.

00:16:46.931 --> 00:16:48.471
You too, Director.

00:17:18.001 --> 00:17:20.871
So Hye. Working on the presentation for the contest?

00:17:21.071 --> 00:17:23.971
Yes, I am, but...

00:17:24.241 --> 00:17:27.941
it's my first time presenting, so I'm really nervous.

00:17:28.411 --> 00:17:31.281
I'll help. Just put together a draft of the presentation for me.

00:17:31.741 --> 00:17:32.751
That's amazing!

00:17:34.211 --> 00:17:37.821
Seriously, Ms. Gong, you're an absolute lifesaver.

00:17:39.491 --> 00:17:41.351
Okay, you can let go.

00:17:42.591 --> 00:17:44.721
- Gong Ju Ah. - Yes?

00:17:44.791 --> 00:17:45.921
The Vice President wants to see you.

00:17:46.791 --> 00:17:47.831
Okay.

00:17:49.661 --> 00:17:51.901
I called you here with a request for the Design Office.

00:17:52.261 --> 00:17:56.401
For the next season, we will launch Kim So Hye's design as its own line,

00:17:56.471 --> 00:17:59.071
as part of a strategy to elevate our brand image.

00:17:59.341 --> 00:18:01.271
Elevating the brand? I love it!

00:18:01.771 --> 00:18:06.651
They've requested a premium spot at Hyegyeong Department Store.

00:18:07.011 --> 00:18:10.721
But they take just two brands a season in that section,

00:18:10.781 --> 00:18:12.421
so it's not going to be easy.

00:18:12.951 --> 00:18:15.351
The waiting list to get in must be totally full too, Director.

00:18:15.721 --> 00:18:18.961
You're underestimating Pacu Nacho. He makes the impossible possible.

00:18:19.391 --> 00:18:22.661
I skipped the official channels and got a meeting with their buyer.

00:18:23.031 --> 00:18:27.271
So we need to rush to get a proposal ready by Monday.

00:18:27.971 --> 00:18:29.031
Any volunteers to help out?

00:18:29.171 --> 00:18:32.711
When it comes to proposals, our Gong Ju Ah is the expert.

00:18:33.671 --> 00:18:36.581
Then Ju Ah can do it. Go to Pacu Nacho's office.

00:18:37.281 --> 00:18:38.281
Wait, hold on.

00:18:38.341 --> 00:18:42.511
But I already promised to help So Hye with her presentation.

00:18:42.581 --> 00:18:45.851
Oh, then I guess Ms. Gong isn't available.

00:18:46.451 --> 00:18:48.621
Hey, it's all part of the same project.

00:18:48.891 --> 00:18:51.361
You can just use the proposal for the presentation materials.

00:18:51.421 --> 00:18:54.991
- That's not how it works. - Oh, come on, you two.

00:18:55.361 --> 00:18:57.501
Everyone here knows you two were each other's first loves.

00:18:59.231 --> 00:19:02.531
I'm pairing you for work, so maybe you can start a romance here, okay?

00:19:02.901 --> 00:19:07.641
Vice President, a comment like that qualifies as workplace coercion...

00:19:07.711 --> 00:19:09.041
and is grounds for disciplinary action.

00:19:09.311 --> 00:19:10.341
That's right.

00:19:11.611 --> 00:19:12.641
Is that so, Mr. Park?

00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:14.651
Coercion? What are you talking about?

00:19:15.511 --> 00:19:16.551
I'd call it an employee perk.

00:19:17.051 --> 00:19:20.651
- You're unbelievable. - Let's keep this professional.

00:19:21.091 --> 00:19:23.091
And let me make one thing perfectly clear.

00:19:23.621 --> 00:19:25.861
Gong Ju Ah and I are just friends.

00:19:26.731 --> 00:19:27.791
- Friends? - Friends?

00:19:29.561 --> 00:19:33.401
Yes. We're just friends.

00:19:42.311 --> 00:19:45.641
Friends? As if. He said he still had feelings for you.

00:19:45.881 --> 00:19:47.781
That was just the alcohol talking.

00:19:48.711 --> 00:19:52.281
Hey! Then why the long face? Are you sure you're just friends?

00:19:52.551 --> 00:19:54.891
I'm not disappointed! And yes, we're definitely just friends.

00:19:56.291 --> 00:19:57.661
"Just friends?" Whatever.

00:19:57.991 --> 00:19:59.591
Men and women can't be "just friends."

00:19:59.731 --> 00:20:02.161
Hey, then what does that make us?

00:20:02.431 --> 00:20:04.461
That's different.

00:20:04.761 --> 00:20:07.231
It's because Pacu Nacho likes Gong Ju Ah.

00:20:07.501 --> 00:20:09.771
Fine. Okay? I like her. Happy now?

00:20:10.141 --> 00:20:11.601
So what am I supposed to do about it?

00:20:11.971 --> 00:20:15.011
I have to go back in a year, and our families are sworn enemies.

00:20:15.341 --> 00:20:17.241
Oh, so you're "just friends" because you have no other choice.

00:20:17.311 --> 00:20:19.851
Right. So just drop it.

00:20:20.511 --> 00:20:23.521
Fine, I get it. I'll be watching.

00:20:26.151 --> 00:20:27.151
(Proposal: Background and Objectives)

00:20:34.891 --> 00:20:35.991
So, what do you think?

00:20:36.261 --> 00:20:38.531
I felt we needed a more aggressive marketing approach,

00:20:38.861 --> 00:20:41.301
so I just whipped up a draft on my own.

00:20:41.571 --> 00:20:43.571
Hush, you're distracting me.

00:20:44.141 --> 00:20:45.201
Right.

00:20:47.971 --> 00:20:51.011
Hey, you're pretty blunt with your director.

00:20:51.581 --> 00:20:53.781
That's a pretty high-handed thing to say.

00:20:54.411 --> 00:20:55.481
Point taken.

00:21:04.261 --> 00:21:06.391
So what don't you like?

00:21:06.831 --> 00:21:10.331
The proposal itself is a nice change from the usual.

00:21:10.401 --> 00:21:14.431
It's unique and impressive. It's just that the slogan is...

00:21:15.371 --> 00:21:16.371
It's kind of lame.

00:21:19.001 --> 00:21:21.741
"Return to our original luxurious vibe,"

00:21:21.811 --> 00:21:24.641
"classic yet experimental."

00:21:24.781 --> 00:21:26.981
That's the kind of feeling I was hoping for.

00:21:27.951 --> 00:21:31.281
Like "Return to Origin?"

00:21:33.851 --> 00:21:36.761
To get back to the essence of FG...

00:21:37.361 --> 00:21:39.061
How about "Return to FG?"

00:21:40.731 --> 00:21:45.301
- Do you like that one? - Yes. You catch on quick.

00:21:46.001 --> 00:21:48.971
Excellent. Very good job, Yang Hyun Bin.

00:21:49.031 --> 00:21:52.941
Are you going to keep treating me like that little middle schooler?

00:21:53.041 --> 00:21:56.811
I'm so proud. You've grown up. I'm impressed.

00:21:57.881 --> 00:22:01.281
- Okay, "Return to FG," it is. - Okay.

00:22:03.551 --> 00:22:06.621
Being back in this room after so long,

00:22:07.091 --> 00:22:09.561
it reminds me of my first day here.

00:22:10.661 --> 00:22:12.961
I even had a nightmare that night.

00:22:14.631 --> 00:22:16.331
Really? I thought it was great.

00:22:16.661 --> 00:22:20.131
Of course, you did. You knew who I was.

00:22:20.731 --> 00:22:25.101
You're so petty and sly. Knowing full well who I was.

00:22:25.301 --> 00:22:26.341
You enjoyed it, didn't you?

00:22:26.941 --> 00:22:28.910
You were unbelievably clueless.

00:22:28.911 --> 00:22:30.241
I told you my name, and you still had no idea.

00:22:30.311 --> 00:22:32.711
So you basically tricked me.

00:22:34.211 --> 00:22:36.451
Guilty as charged. Let's get back to work.

00:22:37.881 --> 00:22:38.881
Fine.

00:22:39.281 --> 00:22:42.291
Even if we work all night, I doubt we can finish by Monday.

00:22:43.261 --> 00:22:44.721
All right, then.

00:22:47.691 --> 00:22:50.461
"Return to FG."

00:22:53.071 --> 00:22:54.171
Not bad.

00:22:55.901 --> 00:22:59.371
Just check if you're for or against opening the night market.

00:23:01.811 --> 00:23:05.581
If we open a night market, it'll bring more youth, right?

00:23:05.911 --> 00:23:07.411
Yes, I suppose so.

00:23:08.651 --> 00:23:12.621
I heard Gopyeong Market became a tourist hot spot by opening one.

00:23:14.451 --> 00:23:16.891
- I hope it turns out well. - Yes, well...

00:23:19.961 --> 00:23:21.191
Darn it.

00:23:22.261 --> 00:23:23.601
How am I supposed to get all this done?

00:23:24.301 --> 00:23:25.601
That jerk...

00:23:27.201 --> 00:23:28.201
But wait.

00:23:29.101 --> 00:23:31.501
If the night market opens, doesn't that mean more work for me?

00:23:32.071 --> 00:23:33.111
Wait a second.

00:23:35.511 --> 00:23:37.211
(Onjeong Night Market Petition: For or against)

00:23:42.281 --> 00:23:44.321
(Onjeong Market Merchants' Association)

00:23:45.881 --> 00:23:48.851
I've collected all the petitions for and against the night market.

00:23:49.521 --> 00:23:51.521
- Already? - Yes, already.

00:23:52.391 --> 00:23:54.191
Man, a lot of people are against it.

00:23:55.931 --> 00:23:57.161
Really? Why?

00:23:57.931 --> 00:24:01.731
They worry night customers will mean their daytime business will suffer,

00:24:01.931 --> 00:24:03.800
and they'll be stuck with all the trash and noise.

00:24:03.801 --> 00:24:05.501
It's obvious it'll mean more work for them.

00:24:06.441 --> 00:24:08.310
That's what they said.

00:24:08.311 --> 00:24:10.141
You have no idea how hard I worked to convince them after all that.

00:24:11.511 --> 00:24:13.181
All right, I get it.

00:24:14.551 --> 00:24:15.851
I can't make it this weekend.

00:24:16.251 --> 00:24:17.251
Why not?

00:24:17.252 --> 00:24:21.091
Hey, I'm going golfing with City Councillor Hwang this Sunday.

00:24:22.051 --> 00:24:24.221
Sunday? Then what about tomorrow?

00:24:24.291 --> 00:24:26.591
Tomorrow, I have to hit the range and warm up.

00:24:27.091 --> 00:24:29.701
Like this. Wow, nice shot!

00:24:30.901 --> 00:24:33.631
Hey. If you want to get that nomination,

00:24:33.771 --> 00:24:38.401
don't show off. Just go easy on him. If you play too well without tact,

00:24:38.571 --> 00:24:41.741
you'll fall out of his favour. Kiss that nomination goodbye.

00:24:43.181 --> 00:24:45.311
Are you telling me you're worried about me?

00:24:49.721 --> 00:24:50.721
Get going.

00:24:52.121 --> 00:24:53.121
Hello?

00:24:54.151 --> 00:24:55.351
The Councillor's Office?

00:24:56.821 --> 00:24:58.591
You mean... Mr. Hwang?

00:24:59.831 --> 00:25:01.631
- Get going. - What? Yes.

00:25:02.991 --> 00:25:04.901
Yes, but may I ask what this is about?

00:25:06.471 --> 00:25:07.531
Right now?

00:25:08.431 --> 00:25:10.341
Yes, I'm available.

00:25:11.801 --> 00:25:13.541
Yes, I know the place. Okay.

00:25:17.111 --> 00:25:18.111
Why is he going in there?

00:25:30.821 --> 00:25:32.561
Hello, sir.

00:25:32.921 --> 00:25:35.291
- It's a pleasure to meet you. - Hello, Mr. Hwang.

00:25:35.791 --> 00:25:37.031
I hear you do a lot of good work.

00:25:37.231 --> 00:25:39.201
Why is Councillor Hwang meeting with that jerk?

00:25:39.361 --> 00:25:40.701
Let's talk more inside.

00:25:41.171 --> 00:25:42.301
Of course.

00:25:47.871 --> 00:25:48.941
What the...

00:25:50.981 --> 00:25:52.011
Councillor Hwang?

00:25:53.081 --> 00:25:54.381
Councillor Hwang? Our district's big shot?

00:25:54.981 --> 00:25:55.981
Yes.

00:25:56.651 --> 00:25:57.721
So, what did he want?

00:25:58.451 --> 00:26:00.450
He's recruiting for the city council.

00:26:00.451 --> 00:26:01.991
He asked if I'd be interested.

00:26:02.251 --> 00:26:04.721
That makes sense. You're respected in the community.

00:26:05.061 --> 00:26:06.961
Also, you're talented and so down-to-earth.

00:26:07.291 --> 00:26:11.301
I guess his parents were my patients at one point.

00:26:11.601 --> 00:26:12.661
I wonder who they are.

00:26:13.101 --> 00:26:15.131
So, you're not interested?

00:26:15.601 --> 00:26:17.501
You've talked about public health policy before.

00:26:17.701 --> 00:26:21.311
No. If your sister-in-law finds out, I'm a dead man.

00:26:21.511 --> 00:26:22.941
Gosh, seriously.

00:26:23.981 --> 00:26:25.981
Hey, by the way...

00:26:26.281 --> 00:26:28.281
Hasn't Bucket been trying to get in good with him?

00:26:28.611 --> 00:26:30.451
If he finds out you met with him, he's going to flip out.

00:26:31.381 --> 00:26:34.491
That's a given. Oh, brother.

00:26:35.621 --> 00:26:37.321
Dr. Gong is quite the sly one, isn't he?

00:26:38.361 --> 00:26:41.291
Don't tell me he's actually aiming to run for city council.

00:26:42.391 --> 00:26:43.731
That jerk's real target is me.

00:26:44.761 --> 00:26:46.801
His goal has always been to take whatever I want.

00:26:47.431 --> 00:26:49.971
Honey, try not to let it get to you.

00:26:50.701 --> 00:26:54.041
He won over my father, and now he's after Mr. Hwang.

00:26:54.111 --> 00:26:55.641
How can I not let it get to me?

00:26:55.941 --> 00:26:57.881
But we have that round of golf, remember?

00:26:58.241 --> 00:27:01.411
I'll be there all day, and I'll do my best to win him over.

00:27:03.451 --> 00:27:07.291
But where have you been? You didn't even make me lunch.

00:27:08.651 --> 00:27:11.491
Did you have a nice, cosy lunch with your father?

00:27:11.961 --> 00:27:16.431
- What father? I don't have one. - Honey, come on, let it go.

00:27:16.801 --> 00:27:19.101
Don't dodge the question. I'm asking where you went.

00:27:19.161 --> 00:27:22.331
What? You didn't track my phone?

00:27:22.531 --> 00:27:24.171
I guess the spark is gone.

00:27:24.301 --> 00:27:26.911
It's not that the spark is gone. It's that I trust you now.

00:27:27.871 --> 00:27:29.741
I have to admit I like the sound of that more.

00:27:29.811 --> 00:27:33.041
I just went shopping with your sister and Eun Bin.

00:27:46.321 --> 00:27:48.661
- Get out. Now. - Look.

00:27:49.131 --> 00:27:51.131
Please, just tell Dae Han to come out here.

00:27:52.001 --> 00:27:53.501
I don't want to go in that house.

00:27:59.271 --> 00:28:00.471
Keep your promise.

00:28:01.041 --> 00:28:03.841
Tell him who your affair was with, and I'll make you pay.

00:28:04.011 --> 00:28:06.411
How many times must I tell you? I get it, okay?

00:28:07.611 --> 00:28:08.681
So...

00:28:09.481 --> 00:28:10.651
the money is mine, right?

00:28:24.331 --> 00:28:25.331
You're back?

00:28:25.861 --> 00:28:29.371
My gosh, where is everyone coming from?

00:28:29.971 --> 00:28:31.341
Dae Han, go out there.

00:28:32.201 --> 00:28:33.241
Hui Gyeong's here.

00:28:35.811 --> 00:28:38.411
What? Hey... What's with him?

00:28:38.741 --> 00:28:41.351
What's going on? Did something happen to her aunt?

00:28:42.251 --> 00:28:43.751
I'll explain.

00:28:44.421 --> 00:28:46.221
Woo Jae, take Grandma inside.

00:28:51.561 --> 00:28:53.731
Why? What is it? What's going on?

00:28:55.531 --> 00:28:58.931
Your sister-in-law is seeing another man.

00:28:59.661 --> 00:29:01.931
The two of them are getting a divorce.

00:29:02.201 --> 00:29:03.231
What?

00:29:04.171 --> 00:29:07.111
What the... Who is this guy?

00:29:07.511 --> 00:29:09.141
We don't know who he is either.

00:29:11.411 --> 00:29:13.781
Go comfort your brother. Okay?

00:29:17.881 --> 00:29:18.881
Unbelievable...

00:29:34.201 --> 00:29:37.241
You're furious with me, aren't you?

00:29:38.301 --> 00:29:39.301
I was just curious.

00:29:40.311 --> 00:29:41.471
About why you did it.

00:29:43.841 --> 00:29:48.111
You knew how my father left us, and because of that,

00:29:48.581 --> 00:29:51.881
you knew how much pain our family went through.

00:29:52.081 --> 00:29:53.851
And I... Honey...

00:29:55.751 --> 00:29:59.691
I took such good care of you and cherished you so much,

00:30:00.531 --> 00:30:02.591
and I loved you so much.

00:30:03.031 --> 00:30:07.471
How could you do this to me? What did I do wrong? I want to know.

00:30:08.001 --> 00:30:10.471
You didn't do anything wrong to me.

00:30:11.501 --> 00:30:12.501
Then...

00:30:14.271 --> 00:30:15.771
Why did you do it?

00:30:16.171 --> 00:30:17.411
I just...

00:30:18.111 --> 00:30:21.481
I fell in love. Love...

00:30:21.751 --> 00:30:23.521
isn't a crime, you know.

00:30:40.301 --> 00:30:41.371
Who is it?

00:30:42.431 --> 00:30:43.871
Is it someone I know?

00:30:51.481 --> 00:30:52.481
Oh, Dad!

00:30:59.221 --> 00:31:00.251
Honey.

00:31:02.851 --> 00:31:04.491
I thought you weren't coming home.

00:31:05.321 --> 00:31:06.961
Of course, I'd come.

00:31:09.291 --> 00:31:10.601
I'm home.

00:31:14.671 --> 00:31:17.501
Honey... What happened?

00:31:29.951 --> 00:31:32.381
It's all here. Thank goodness.

00:31:32.451 --> 00:31:33.751
I'm saved.

00:31:34.751 --> 00:31:38.261
- I took the store items back. - Good.

00:31:39.691 --> 00:31:42.761
I was so worried! I was afraid you'd go gambling again...

00:31:42.831 --> 00:31:44.031
Let's get a divorce.

00:31:44.661 --> 00:31:46.701
- What? - I said, let's get a divorce.

00:31:46.831 --> 00:31:49.731
What do you mean, a divorce? What matters is that you're back.

00:31:49.801 --> 00:31:51.141
You can clean up your act, and we'll be fine.

00:31:51.401 --> 00:31:53.711
I no longer want to live with you, Yang Dong Suk.

00:31:53.741 --> 00:31:56.611
What? You're the one in the wrong. What right do you have to be angry?

00:31:56.671 --> 00:31:59.981
I really hate you. I can't even stand to look at you.

00:32:02.251 --> 00:32:03.251
What?

00:32:04.451 --> 00:32:05.451
Why?

00:32:07.921 --> 00:32:09.451
Why did you stop loving me?

00:32:10.021 --> 00:32:11.691
It's not that I stopped loving you.

00:32:14.991 --> 00:32:17.361
I never loved you in the first place.

00:32:18.331 --> 00:32:19.331
From the beginning?

00:32:20.971 --> 00:32:25.271
But, then... Then, why did you marry me?

00:32:26.541 --> 00:32:29.341
You were dependable, like a big brother,

00:32:29.741 --> 00:32:32.741
and like a good person. And...

00:32:35.511 --> 00:32:38.451
You come from a family of doctors, so I thought I would be well-off.

00:32:40.451 --> 00:32:41.521
Thanks.

00:32:42.691 --> 00:32:44.291
Thanks for being so honest.

00:32:45.661 --> 00:32:47.591
And if I'm being brutally honest,

00:32:48.091 --> 00:32:49.861
I never even wanted to have a child.

00:32:52.861 --> 00:32:54.431
Wow, it feels good to get that off my chest.

00:32:55.931 --> 00:32:59.041
So I was the only one in love this whole time, and I had no idea?

00:32:59.801 --> 00:33:03.371
Wow. You must have been miserable living with me.

00:33:04.511 --> 00:33:06.011
That's not it...

00:33:06.341 --> 00:33:10.321
I ran away because I couldn't stand seeing you get hurt.

00:33:10.381 --> 00:33:11.381
Let's do it.

00:33:12.951 --> 00:33:13.951
Let's get a divorce.

00:33:27.501 --> 00:33:29.701
- I am not divorcing you. - Yes, you are.

00:33:30.031 --> 00:33:31.601
If you don't, I'll run away again.

00:33:31.771 --> 00:33:34.671
If you hate me that much, at least stay for Ji Hu.

00:33:34.771 --> 00:33:38.381
Ji Hu's all grown up. He knows what's going on.

00:33:38.611 --> 00:33:42.451
I'll explain things to Ji Hu. Let's just end this amicably.

00:33:42.811 --> 00:33:44.581
I will never agree to a divorce.

00:33:44.921 --> 00:33:48.051
If my father or my brother finds out, they'll go ballistic!

00:33:48.121 --> 00:33:49.890
That's so ridiculous.

00:33:49.891 --> 00:33:51.891
Your mom, your ex, and your sister-in-law have all left!

00:33:51.961 --> 00:33:53.891
So why can't I?

00:33:54.661 --> 00:33:56.091
Please, stop.

00:33:58.001 --> 00:34:00.001
I won't ask you to be nice to me.

00:34:00.531 --> 00:34:03.071
It was so hard for me after my mom left.

00:34:03.671 --> 00:34:06.841
Hyun Bin and Eun Bin, too. After their mom left,

00:34:06.871 --> 00:34:08.841
they had such a hard time growing up.

00:34:09.671 --> 00:34:12.881
Please, let's not do that to our Ji Hu. Honey, please?

00:34:14.281 --> 00:34:15.911
I'll do better, I promise. Okay?

00:34:26.991 --> 00:34:29.631
(Taehan)

00:34:31.961 --> 00:34:34.071
Ms. Gong! Over here!

00:34:36.401 --> 00:34:37.841
Gosh, you scared me.

00:34:40.841 --> 00:34:43.241
Ms. Gong, has it been a few hours already?

00:34:43.941 --> 00:34:45.141
About five.

00:34:46.111 --> 00:34:49.511
So why are you eating dinner here instead of going home?

00:34:49.711 --> 00:34:54.491
I have no family waiting up for me, and my fridge is empty.

00:34:54.791 --> 00:34:58.091
I lost track of time while outlining my presentation.

00:34:58.661 --> 00:35:02.691
But I'm glad. I get to have dinner with you, Ms. Gong.

00:35:04.831 --> 00:35:08.331
Ms. Gong, would you want to go on a blind date with my brother?

00:35:09.231 --> 00:35:10.301
A blind date?

00:35:14.611 --> 00:35:16.871
Where did that come from?

00:35:17.181 --> 00:35:20.611
He's handsome, fit, and easygoing. And he makes tons of money.

00:35:20.681 --> 00:35:22.611
He's the total package.

00:35:23.151 --> 00:35:24.681
For a second, I thought you were talking about me.

00:35:26.521 --> 00:35:29.451
- You're laughing too loud. - My bad.

00:35:31.091 --> 00:35:34.191
Ms. Gong, please marry my brother.

00:35:34.261 --> 00:35:36.791
Please, be a part of my family!

00:35:37.661 --> 00:35:40.471
Forget it. I'm not thinking about marriage.

00:35:40.571 --> 00:35:45.241
- Come on, Ms. Gong. - Let's just eat. All right?

00:35:45.901 --> 00:35:46.941
Okay.

00:35:48.041 --> 00:35:49.111
Hey, by the way...

00:35:49.441 --> 00:35:52.181
- Are you two working late tonight? - Yes. Why?

00:35:52.781 --> 00:35:56.211
You must've missed the notice. There's a facility check at 8pm.

00:35:56.311 --> 00:35:57.351
They're shutting off the heat.

00:36:02.451 --> 00:36:05.861
Are there any meeting rooms we can book?

00:36:09.491 --> 00:36:11.661
None? Okay, got it.

00:36:13.461 --> 00:36:16.271
Oh, they're all booked? All right, I understand.

00:36:17.671 --> 00:36:21.041
What should we do? All the co-working spaces are full.

00:36:21.971 --> 00:36:23.271
Now, what?

00:36:24.181 --> 00:36:27.580
- Should we try a hotel? - What?

00:36:27.581 --> 00:36:30.151
Why? There's one right next door.

00:36:31.021 --> 00:36:32.251
Right, exactly.

00:36:32.881 --> 00:36:36.221
It's right next door, so tons of people will see us,

00:36:36.851 --> 00:36:38.861
and they might get the wrong idea, don't you think?

00:36:39.661 --> 00:36:41.391
We're just friends.

00:36:44.031 --> 00:36:45.531
I know, but still...

00:36:47.631 --> 00:36:49.101
Maybe we could...

00:36:50.031 --> 00:36:51.701
go to my place?

00:37:04.381 --> 00:37:07.421
You take this white sundae gopchang, wrap it in a perilla leaf...

00:37:07.921 --> 00:37:09.191
It'll blow your mind.

00:37:09.991 --> 00:37:13.561
I absolutely love sundae gopchang. How did you know?

00:37:14.731 --> 00:37:16.331
Because you've always loved it.

00:37:18.101 --> 00:37:19.101
That's right.

00:37:20.531 --> 00:37:23.631
I threw in some plain sundae too, on the house.

00:37:24.901 --> 00:37:28.041
It's nice you have company for once. You always come alone.

00:37:29.371 --> 00:37:30.371
Your girlfriend?

00:37:31.381 --> 00:37:34.281
Gosh, no. We're just...

00:37:34.781 --> 00:37:36.811
Friends. Old friends.

00:37:37.181 --> 00:37:39.781
Oh, my mistake.

00:37:40.991 --> 00:37:43.821
- Thanks so much. Have a good night. - You too. Come again.

00:37:43.891 --> 00:37:45.091
- We will. - Take care.

00:37:48.191 --> 00:37:50.131
Yes, I just got home.

00:37:51.131 --> 00:37:53.661
Did you narrow down the candidates for the model?

00:37:53.931 --> 00:37:55.871
Instead of an actor or a celebrity,

00:37:56.131 --> 00:37:58.441
we're looking for a prominent figure who hasn't been in ads or shoots.

00:37:59.071 --> 00:38:02.711
But in that case, won't they be completely unknown?

00:38:03.211 --> 00:38:06.941
But it's a win-win since they'd fit the premium image we're going for.

00:38:07.551 --> 00:38:10.921
Do you know Dr. Han Seong Mi? She's a psychiatrist on TV shows.

00:38:10.981 --> 00:38:12.821
Who did you say?

00:38:13.221 --> 00:38:14.891
Wow, you've already got everything set up.

00:38:15.121 --> 00:38:18.491
What was that? Hey, is that Gong Ju Ah with you?

00:38:19.091 --> 00:38:21.891
What are you two doing together at your place this late?

00:38:21.961 --> 00:38:24.701
- We're just friends, that's all! - Give me a break! Hey!

00:38:25.061 --> 00:38:27.501
My gosh! Did he just hang up on me?

00:38:28.231 --> 00:38:29.271
"Friends," my foot.

00:38:31.841 --> 00:38:32.871
What are you going to do?

00:38:33.571 --> 00:38:35.671
I'll just face some grilling, that's all.

00:38:36.141 --> 00:38:37.141
Come on, let's eat.

00:38:41.351 --> 00:38:43.681
I have a feeling it'll be more than just "some grilling."

00:38:44.781 --> 00:38:47.891
We'll deal with that later. Let's eat first.

00:38:49.091 --> 00:38:51.291
Okay, let's dig in.

00:38:51.991 --> 00:38:53.391
Okay, the sundae first.

00:38:57.761 --> 00:39:02.131
- This plump sundae and... - And the chewy tripe. Great combo.

00:39:04.371 --> 00:39:08.071
You have some too, Director. Oh, should I make a wrap for you?

00:39:08.911 --> 00:39:13.481
Okay, so some sundae and tripe.

00:39:13.841 --> 00:39:14.851
Some onion.

00:39:15.211 --> 00:39:18.981
- Add onion and a hot pepper? Good? - I'm okay.

00:39:19.481 --> 00:39:20.481
And then...

00:39:22.191 --> 00:39:23.191
Open wide.

00:39:23.721 --> 00:39:25.821
Hey, I made this wrap just for you.

00:39:26.121 --> 00:39:28.461
- Open wide. Come on. - No, I'm good.

00:39:30.231 --> 00:39:33.461
- Fine... - There you go. Delicious, isn't it?

00:39:36.801 --> 00:39:37.801
Delicious, right?

00:39:39.841 --> 00:39:40.911
All right, then...

00:39:44.911 --> 00:39:46.641
The rice cakes! I have to eat the rice cakes, too.

00:39:54.491 --> 00:39:57.361
What is it? Am I stuffing my face?

00:40:00.121 --> 00:40:03.591
Didn't I always say you have a healthy appetite?

00:40:04.501 --> 00:40:06.201
I don't really remember you saying that.

00:40:09.231 --> 00:40:12.101
Right. About the model for FG's premium line,

00:40:12.441 --> 00:40:14.311
they're considering Dr. Han Seong Mi.

00:40:14.941 --> 00:40:15.941
What?

00:40:16.811 --> 00:40:18.011
The people at work...

00:40:18.281 --> 00:40:20.881
don't know that Dr. Han is your mother, do they?

00:40:21.351 --> 00:40:25.221
Right. At work, Mr. Park is the only one who knows.

00:40:26.021 --> 00:40:27.021
You don't like the idea?

00:40:29.991 --> 00:40:31.661
My mom will probably turn it down.

00:40:32.161 --> 00:40:34.331
She absolutely hates that I'm a designer.

00:40:35.861 --> 00:40:40.161
She's still mad I quit medicine when I already had my license.

00:40:42.471 --> 00:40:44.501
So I'm the reason your relationship with your mother went sour.

00:40:45.471 --> 00:40:46.471
If I...

00:40:46.741 --> 00:40:48.871
hadn't opened up that new world for you,

00:40:49.211 --> 00:40:50.711
you would've become a doctor, right?

00:40:52.311 --> 00:40:55.451
I shouldn't have said anything! Now, I totally regret it.

00:40:56.051 --> 00:40:57.051
Seriously.

00:41:00.051 --> 00:41:01.091
By the way,

00:41:01.491 --> 00:41:03.291
why aren't you interested in getting married?

00:41:06.191 --> 00:41:09.491
Well... There's no big reason.

00:41:09.831 --> 00:41:14.101
It's just that I don't know any happily married people.

00:41:17.841 --> 00:41:18.841
Director.

00:41:19.571 --> 00:41:21.741
Do you remember my uncle?

00:41:22.871 --> 00:41:26.011
Of course, I remember Uncle Dae Han. He was always so good to me.

00:41:27.811 --> 00:41:30.721
He's been going through a really tough time lately.

00:41:31.551 --> 00:41:32.551
Why? What's wrong?

00:41:35.891 --> 00:41:38.391
His wife had an affair and left him.

00:41:40.731 --> 00:41:41.831
My gosh.

00:41:42.461 --> 00:41:44.261
Is there something in the water in Onjeong?

00:41:44.331 --> 00:41:49.101
- Right? Why is everyone leaving? - Unbelievable.

00:41:50.671 --> 00:41:52.340
The one she had the affair with...

00:41:52.341 --> 00:41:54.111
can't be someone in my family, right?

00:41:54.911 --> 00:41:58.281
Of course not! Don't even say something so awful.

00:41:59.011 --> 00:42:00.681
Gosh, I take it back.

00:42:00.981 --> 00:42:02.711
Now that I've said it out loud, that does sound horrible.

00:42:03.511 --> 00:42:05.751
Go away, bad juju! Go away!

00:42:06.121 --> 00:42:07.121
What are you doing?

00:42:07.181 --> 00:42:11.891
Don't jinx it! We can't repeat that nightmare from 30 years ago.

00:42:12.691 --> 00:42:16.661
For me, too. Go away, bad thoughts. Go away! Goodness.

00:42:17.431 --> 00:42:19.361
And this sundae also needs to...

00:42:20.131 --> 00:42:21.131
disappear into my mouth.

00:42:25.301 --> 00:42:27.541
So, he agreed to the divorce?

00:42:28.671 --> 00:42:29.741
That's great.

00:42:31.011 --> 00:42:33.311
Things are a little messy on my end.

00:42:34.311 --> 00:42:38.621
Hey, don't worry. I want a clean slate with you, too.

00:42:39.681 --> 00:42:41.951
Yes, I'll take care of it by tomorrow, no matter what.

00:42:42.521 --> 00:42:44.961
Yes. All right, sleep well.

00:42:45.221 --> 00:42:46.221
Got it.

00:42:49.261 --> 00:42:51.031
Do I have to get on my knees and beg her?

00:42:51.801 --> 00:42:53.201
Seriously... Darn it.

00:42:56.001 --> 00:42:58.001
Darn it!

00:43:08.411 --> 00:43:10.851
So that's why that jerk wanted a divorce.

00:43:11.721 --> 00:43:13.051
What are you going to do?

00:43:13.851 --> 00:43:16.121
Are you going to divorce him?

00:43:18.261 --> 00:43:19.491
I can't.

00:43:20.491 --> 00:43:21.831
I can't divorce him.

00:43:23.931 --> 00:43:24.931
I see.

00:43:25.661 --> 00:43:28.531
If you're not going to divorce him, then there's only one thing to do.

00:43:30.101 --> 00:43:32.341
We have to find out who she is and make her pay.

00:43:34.271 --> 00:43:37.781
Dong Suk. You need to listen to me carefully.

00:43:40.781 --> 00:43:43.581
Dae Han, please listen to me carefully.

00:43:44.521 --> 00:43:45.651
Okay.

00:43:46.481 --> 00:43:50.751
This only happened because your wife made an immature choice.

00:43:51.261 --> 00:43:53.391
It's not your fault at all.

00:43:54.931 --> 00:43:56.891
So please, don't blame yourself.

00:43:57.531 --> 00:43:58.831
Let's focus on helping you recover.

00:43:59.561 --> 00:44:02.371
But how can I not? The whole family's worried about me.

00:44:03.601 --> 00:44:05.171
I'm really okay, though.

00:44:05.501 --> 00:44:09.311
It's okay not to be okay, Dae Han. We're family.

00:44:11.741 --> 00:44:12.741
So...

00:44:13.041 --> 00:44:15.711
don't just force a smile and pretend you're okay.

00:44:16.281 --> 00:44:18.321
All your pent-up, painful feelings...

00:44:18.651 --> 00:44:21.551
Don't hold them in. Let it all out.

00:44:22.221 --> 00:44:23.221
Okay?

00:44:25.321 --> 00:44:26.321
Okay.

00:44:39.341 --> 00:44:40.541
What are you doing in my room?

00:44:41.541 --> 00:44:42.541
Were you waiting for me?

00:44:43.541 --> 00:44:46.141
Waiting? No. I just couldn't sleep.

00:44:46.711 --> 00:44:49.211
I was looking for some sheet music and thought it might be in here.

00:44:49.681 --> 00:44:52.481
What sheet music? You mean Dad's old yellow songbook?

00:44:53.481 --> 00:44:55.421
I bundled all that up and put it in storage.

00:44:55.721 --> 00:44:56.751
You did? I see.

00:44:57.791 --> 00:45:01.791
How about we sing one from memory? Mom's favourite.

00:45:01.891 --> 00:45:04.461
- "I Miss You More and More." - Right, that one!

00:45:05.631 --> 00:45:07.731
Is this the right key for it?

00:45:09.431 --> 00:45:10.731
Yes, that's it.

00:45:12.371 --> 00:45:16.041
My darling love, once so kind

00:45:16.411 --> 00:45:18.911
Have you forgotten me?

00:45:20.041 --> 00:45:25.481
Have you already forgotten me?

00:45:29.091 --> 00:45:30.391
Hey, did you hear about Hui Gyeong?

00:45:30.791 --> 00:45:31.791
What?

00:45:33.361 --> 00:45:36.361
- Yes, I heard. - Man...

00:45:37.861 --> 00:45:40.131
Gosh, I feel so bad for Seong Mi.

00:45:40.631 --> 00:45:43.371
If I had moved out, she could be using this room by now.

00:45:44.131 --> 00:45:47.271
Don't be silly. I like sharing a room with my wife.

00:45:49.111 --> 00:45:50.111
So I get the credit for that?

00:45:51.141 --> 00:45:54.011
Wow, thanks a lot. Really.

00:45:54.781 --> 00:45:56.051
Sing it. Come on.

00:46:01.891 --> 00:46:07.291
Have you forgotten me, leaving me to long for you?

00:46:08.861 --> 00:46:14.001
- Have you already forgotten me? - Have you already forgotten me?

00:46:17.001 --> 00:46:20.001
Goodness. Why are they singing? People are trying to sleep.

00:46:21.471 --> 00:46:24.211
I told him to go comfort him, and now look at them.

00:46:25.011 --> 00:46:26.781
That's your favourite song, isn't it?

00:46:27.411 --> 00:46:30.881
Dad used to sing that for you too, back in the day.

00:46:33.051 --> 00:46:35.750
They say sad things happen to people who like sad songs.

00:46:35.751 --> 00:46:37.860
Now, I wonder if these things keep happening...

00:46:37.861 --> 00:46:39.391
because I like sad songs.

00:46:40.491 --> 00:46:44.261
You're taking on too much by blaming yourself for everything.

00:46:45.161 --> 00:46:48.171
How can everything that's gone wrong possibly be your fault?

00:46:49.971 --> 00:46:51.841
Oh, Mother.

00:46:52.901 --> 00:46:55.741
My poor, heartbroken mother-in-law.

00:46:56.411 --> 00:46:57.911
I'm going to have to prescribe you a dose of love.

00:47:02.351 --> 00:47:04.051
We're going to be okay.

00:47:05.521 --> 00:47:07.181
We'll be fine, Mother.

00:47:09.321 --> 00:47:13.891
- I never knew - I never knew

00:47:13.961 --> 00:47:17.231
- That your heart - That your heart would change

00:47:18.761 --> 00:47:21.901
I really never knew

00:47:41.491 --> 00:47:43.651
Gosh, I swear...

00:48:23.431 --> 00:48:24.431
Are you awake?

00:48:25.831 --> 00:48:27.101
I wasn't asleep.

00:48:29.571 --> 00:48:31.401
You say that, but you were dead to the world.

00:48:32.001 --> 00:48:33.971
What would you have done if you'd taken a cab by yourself?

00:48:35.271 --> 00:48:39.381
Why turn on the seat warmer? I got cosy and fell asleep.

00:48:43.481 --> 00:48:44.481
Thanks for today.

00:48:47.251 --> 00:48:48.591
I'll be going in tomorrow, too.

00:48:49.451 --> 00:48:52.721
- Should I pick you up tomorrow? - No, that's okay.

00:48:53.361 --> 00:48:54.931
You should go get some rest.

00:48:55.791 --> 00:48:56.791
All right.

00:48:58.601 --> 00:49:00.131
Thanks for the ride home, Director.

00:49:11.041 --> 00:49:13.441
I'll wait up, so can you text me when you're home?

00:49:13.741 --> 00:49:14.781
I'll just end up worrying.

00:49:15.611 --> 00:49:17.811
- Okay. - Go on.

00:49:32.731 --> 00:49:35.171
Gosh, I don't want to be just friends.

00:49:36.071 --> 00:49:37.071
What am I going to do?

00:49:42.541 --> 00:49:43.541
Mom, are you crazy?

00:49:44.241 --> 00:49:46.211
She stole that money. You'll give it to her as alimony?

00:49:46.481 --> 00:49:49.281
I have my reasons. Just leave it at that.

00:49:49.681 --> 00:49:53.381
So you moved out of your apartment just to do them a favour.

00:49:53.921 --> 00:49:55.321
It's just money. I can always make more.

00:49:57.291 --> 00:49:59.320
About the model for FG's premium line,

00:49:59.321 --> 00:50:01.391
they're considering Dr. Han Seong Mi.

00:50:03.591 --> 00:50:07.661
Mom, are all the clothes you wear for your TV appearances sponsored?

00:50:09.031 --> 00:50:11.901
It's mostly my own stuff. Sponsored clothes are a pain.

00:50:12.671 --> 00:50:14.841
Your fees can't be high enough to justify buying new outfits.

00:50:15.211 --> 00:50:16.971
Don't start with me this early in the morning.

00:50:18.941 --> 00:50:20.041
I'm heading out.

00:50:21.511 --> 00:50:22.910
You came home so late last night.

00:50:22.911 --> 00:50:24.111
It's the weekend. Where are you going?

00:50:24.411 --> 00:50:25.621
I'm going to work.

00:50:26.051 --> 00:50:29.221
And here I was thinking you'd finally gotten a boyfriend.

00:50:29.351 --> 00:50:32.021
Oh, please. After what happened with Uncle? Dating?

00:50:32.121 --> 00:50:36.891
I've lost all interest. Bring me the most amazing guy in the world,

00:50:36.961 --> 00:50:38.001
and I wouldn't even blink.

00:50:39.631 --> 00:50:40.631
Gosh, that brat...

00:51:15.501 --> 00:51:16.501
Gong...

00:51:31.481 --> 00:51:32.481
Hey, So Hye.

00:51:32.751 --> 00:51:34.451
Oh? Ms. Gong.

00:51:34.821 --> 00:51:37.251
Is that your boyfriend, So Hye? He's handsome.

00:51:39.791 --> 00:51:41.761
What do you think? Not bad, right?

00:51:42.131 --> 00:51:45.031
Yes, you guys look great together. He's cute.

00:51:45.331 --> 00:51:47.561
If you think he's cute, I can set you up.

00:51:47.931 --> 00:51:49.271
He's actually my older brother.

00:51:49.831 --> 00:51:52.541
Oh, the total package?

00:51:52.641 --> 00:51:56.571
Yes! You should be my sister-in-law, Ms. Gong!

00:51:57.671 --> 00:51:59.341
I've told you I'm not interested in getting married.

00:51:59.511 --> 00:52:03.181
That's only because you haven't met the right guy yet.

00:52:04.051 --> 00:52:05.051
You think so?

00:52:06.321 --> 00:52:07.381
Good morning.

00:52:08.621 --> 00:52:10.491
- Good morning, Director. - Morning.

00:52:10.551 --> 00:52:14.021
- Good morning. - Hi. Ms. Kim, why are you here?

00:52:14.091 --> 00:52:15.161
You should be taking the weekend off.

00:52:16.231 --> 00:52:19.131
Okay, I'll talk to my brother and get right back to you.

00:52:19.601 --> 00:52:21.061
Is that all right?

00:52:21.601 --> 00:52:24.801
Gosh, this is awkward. I already said no, thank you.

00:52:25.401 --> 00:52:26.571
Anyway, let's just head inside.

00:52:26.901 --> 00:52:27.941
Okay.

00:52:35.851 --> 00:52:37.181
You're trying to set me up again?

00:52:38.081 --> 00:52:41.281
Gosh, So Hye. Why are you being so pushy?

00:52:41.551 --> 00:52:43.191
I'm telling you, I'm really not interested.

00:52:43.851 --> 00:52:47.921
Fine, okay. Just one cup of tea. That's it.

00:52:48.461 --> 00:52:49.461
Tea? Why?

00:52:49.891 --> 00:52:51.431
Let's just meet somewhere close by.

00:52:52.061 --> 00:52:54.501
What about the hotel coffee shop right next to the office?

00:52:55.701 --> 00:52:56.730
Yes.

00:52:56.731 --> 00:52:58.871
(Taehan Group)

00:53:11.781 --> 00:53:14.281
It's chrysanthemum tea, Father. Caffeine-free.

00:53:14.581 --> 00:53:15.591
All right.

00:53:16.551 --> 00:53:17.551
Father?

00:53:17.951 --> 00:53:21.531
I want to return the 40,000 dollars you transferred to me.

00:53:22.261 --> 00:53:23.261
Why?

00:53:23.431 --> 00:53:26.661
I originally asked because I had a pressing need for it,

00:53:26.831 --> 00:53:28.371
but that's no longer the case.

00:53:28.831 --> 00:53:31.941
Keep it anyway. Buy yourself something nice.

00:53:32.141 --> 00:53:35.741
No, Father. You always give me more than I need.

00:53:36.471 --> 00:53:40.981
And as for my husband... Please give him time to cool off.

00:53:41.141 --> 00:53:42.151
He'll come around soon.

00:53:44.211 --> 00:53:45.221
All right.

00:53:50.421 --> 00:53:53.661
That thing you said before about settling Hyun Bin down...

00:53:53.991 --> 00:53:55.061
What's the status on that?

00:53:55.761 --> 00:53:58.831
Oh, I was just about to bring that up.

00:53:59.461 --> 00:54:03.271
Councillor Hwang has a daughter who's more than ready to marry.

00:54:03.631 --> 00:54:04.631
Really?

00:54:04.841 --> 00:54:06.370
Starting tomorrow,

00:54:06.371 --> 00:54:07.971
I'll get close to the Councillor and his wife at golf.

00:54:08.071 --> 00:54:11.641
Then I'll set up their daughter with our Hyun Bin.

00:54:13.481 --> 00:54:14.711
You really do...

00:54:16.081 --> 00:54:18.681
have a plan for everything.

00:54:22.721 --> 00:54:25.361
(70s and 80s Throwback Concert)

00:54:30.891 --> 00:54:31.901
Hey.

00:54:39.641 --> 00:54:43.371
I left a printout of the proposal on your desk for you to review.

00:54:43.811 --> 00:54:45.281
I'm heading out for the day.

00:54:47.481 --> 00:54:50.781
Wait, she's just going to leave for her blind date like that?

00:54:53.851 --> 00:54:58.121
(Hotel)

00:55:15.071 --> 00:55:16.541
Why did I even follow her here?

00:55:17.311 --> 00:55:19.481
What do I care if she goes on a blind date?

00:55:20.041 --> 00:55:21.041
We're just friends.

00:55:53.211 --> 00:55:55.111
- Director? - What?

00:55:56.481 --> 00:55:58.921
You got my text, right?

00:55:59.221 --> 00:56:00.221
Yes.

00:56:01.421 --> 00:56:03.151
You said you were leaving, but you're here?

00:56:03.891 --> 00:56:06.521
I was just picking up some sweets for my uncle.

00:56:06.821 --> 00:56:08.961
Wow, this cake sells out so fast, you know?

00:56:09.191 --> 00:56:12.201
Luckily, I was able to get the last one.

00:56:12.701 --> 00:56:15.931
Actually, it's sold out every time, so I missed out last time too.

00:56:16.001 --> 00:56:18.741
I assumed I'd be out of luck again today,

00:56:19.071 --> 00:56:21.101
which makes finally getting one feel even better.

00:56:22.341 --> 00:56:26.881
My uncle can be surprisingly picky. I hope he likes it.

00:56:27.241 --> 00:56:29.681
If he hates it, too bad. He'll just have to like it, right?

00:56:32.351 --> 00:56:34.651
By the way, what brings you here, Director?

00:56:36.591 --> 00:56:37.621
I was just wondering that myself.

00:56:38.121 --> 00:56:39.721
Why am I here, indeed?

00:56:41.561 --> 00:56:44.291
Didn't you say you were stepping out to buy something?

00:56:44.761 --> 00:56:46.831
What did you need from here?

00:56:55.341 --> 00:56:57.341
(Police)

00:56:58.811 --> 00:57:01.711
(Onjeong Police Substation)

00:57:02.281 --> 00:57:04.911
Why do you think it's so quiet?

00:57:05.221 --> 00:57:06.381
Tell me about it.

00:57:06.951 --> 00:57:09.421
It's eerily quiet, like the eye of a storm.

00:57:10.591 --> 00:57:13.791
We can't tell anyone what we know, right?

00:57:14.161 --> 00:57:15.291
Of course not.

00:57:15.731 --> 00:57:17.991
As far as anyone's concerned, we don't know anything.

00:57:18.461 --> 00:57:21.501
But what if both families find out...

00:57:21.931 --> 00:57:23.131
That's only a matter of time, right?

00:57:23.471 --> 00:57:25.771
And then a tornado's going to hit.

00:57:25.841 --> 00:57:27.471
(Onjeong Police Substation)

00:57:27.541 --> 00:57:29.541
We could be looking at the storm of the century.

00:57:30.071 --> 00:57:31.171
Officer Jung.

00:57:31.711 --> 00:57:33.941
It's our job to stop it.

00:57:34.511 --> 00:57:38.621
It seems the peace of Onjeong rests in our hands.

00:57:41.181 --> 00:57:42.191
Yes, sir.

00:57:42.851 --> 00:57:45.621
We're on high alert. Let's start our patrol.

00:57:46.491 --> 00:57:47.491
Let's do it.

00:57:47.561 --> 00:57:50.461
(Onjeong Police Substation)

00:57:55.071 --> 00:57:57.501
Dong Suk, please listen to me.

00:57:57.631 --> 00:58:00.271
If we're going to live like this, maybe it's better if we...

00:58:07.211 --> 00:58:08.511
Ta-da!

00:58:09.511 --> 00:58:13.481
- We match. Do you like them? - What?

00:58:14.451 --> 00:58:16.121
Yes. You guys look great.

00:58:16.821 --> 00:58:18.721
I got a new outfit for the special occasion.

00:58:19.291 --> 00:58:21.291
So, how was your business trip?

00:58:21.561 --> 00:58:22.561
Sorry?

00:58:23.291 --> 00:58:25.161
Yes, of course.

00:58:25.701 --> 00:58:28.201
And here I thought you'd run off with the family silver.

00:58:29.171 --> 00:58:31.471
Honey, don't be ridiculous. As if he'd do that.

00:58:32.101 --> 00:58:33.671
And you, what's with the long face?

00:58:35.771 --> 00:58:39.341
Dong Ik, if I were really that kind of person,

00:58:40.241 --> 00:58:44.481
- we'd have to divorce, right? - Divorce? What are you saying?

00:58:45.251 --> 00:58:47.251
The word "divorce" is forbidden in this house.

00:58:47.681 --> 00:58:52.321
If anything like that happens, you'll leave this house in a casket.

00:58:53.021 --> 00:58:54.261
Honey, please.

00:58:55.431 --> 00:58:56.491
My gosh.

00:58:58.031 --> 00:58:59.061
Yes, ma'am?

00:59:00.461 --> 00:59:02.971
What do you mean by that?

00:59:05.001 --> 00:59:07.441
Mr. Hwang cancelled his tee time?

00:59:08.941 --> 00:59:10.371
What? All of a sudden?

00:59:10.771 --> 00:59:13.841
Wait, can you at least tell me why? Hello?

00:59:15.151 --> 00:59:16.211
Did they hang up?

00:59:17.311 --> 00:59:18.311
Yes.

00:59:19.251 --> 00:59:21.321
I'm sure that jerk Jeong Han is behind this.

00:59:21.721 --> 00:59:24.691
I told you. He'd try to take everything from me.

00:59:26.621 --> 00:59:27.821
That jerk...

00:59:29.091 --> 00:59:30.461
Yes, sir.

00:59:31.161 --> 00:59:34.861
I'm calling about the petition against the night market you signed.

00:59:35.131 --> 00:59:36.871
I just wanted to talk to you about...

00:59:37.671 --> 00:59:38.671
Pardon?

00:59:40.941 --> 00:59:42.771
So you haven't signed it yet.

00:59:43.371 --> 00:59:47.111
Yes, it seems I was misinformed. My apologies.

00:59:49.011 --> 00:59:52.751
Gosh, that jerk. I knew it. I can't believe that Bucket.

00:59:52.821 --> 00:59:53.951
Hey, Gong Jeong Han!

00:59:55.991 --> 00:59:57.821
Speak of the devil.

00:59:58.821 --> 01:00:00.191
You jerk. Explain yourself.

01:00:00.591 --> 01:00:03.131
- What did you do? - What did I do?

01:00:03.491 --> 01:00:06.531
You're the one in the wrong. How dare you come at me first?

01:00:06.631 --> 01:00:08.061
Why did you meet with Councillor Hwang?

01:00:08.501 --> 01:00:11.871
What did you say that made him cancel the golf outing?

01:00:13.041 --> 01:00:17.271
What are you talking about? Change my mind? How could I?

01:00:19.141 --> 01:00:21.881
If we try to run away, they'll chase us forever.

01:00:22.581 --> 01:00:24.751
Let's get a clean divorce and start over fresh, okay?

01:00:25.651 --> 01:00:28.450
Okay, fine. But let's meet, even if it's just for a moment.

01:00:28.451 --> 01:00:31.291
All right, I'll meet you there. Okay.

01:00:31.961 --> 01:00:35.191
Dong Suk, listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

01:00:36.491 --> 01:00:37.931
They say if you know your enemy and know yourself,

01:00:38.231 --> 01:00:39.861
you can win a hundred battles.

01:00:40.431 --> 01:00:43.571
If we're going to nail her, we need to know who she is, don't we?

01:01:16.701 --> 01:01:21.001
Did you want to say something to me? Is that why you gave me a ride?

01:01:22.071 --> 01:01:24.041
I was just gathering my thoughts on the way.

01:01:25.311 --> 01:01:28.181
What is it that's so serious? You're making me nervous.

01:01:28.911 --> 01:01:30.081
Earlier today,

01:01:30.881 --> 01:01:33.051
I didn't go to the hotel on business.

01:01:33.551 --> 01:01:34.851
I thought...

01:01:34.951 --> 01:01:36.951
you were on your blind date, so I followed you.

01:01:38.551 --> 01:01:40.461
My blind date is tomorrow.

01:01:43.131 --> 01:01:44.161
That's a relief.

01:01:45.161 --> 01:01:47.561
If that had been your date today,

01:01:48.671 --> 01:01:50.901
I probably would've crashed it.

01:01:52.971 --> 01:01:54.001
Why?

01:01:55.911 --> 01:01:56.971
Because I would've hated it.

01:02:00.941 --> 01:02:02.411
The thought of you smiling...

01:02:03.281 --> 01:02:06.551
at another guy like that... I just couldn't stand it.

01:02:08.521 --> 01:02:09.551
But we're...

01:02:10.151 --> 01:02:11.391
just friends.

01:02:12.561 --> 01:02:13.961
I know.

01:02:14.991 --> 01:02:17.861
My head knows that, but my heart...

01:02:18.231 --> 01:02:21.761
- My gosh. - Surprised? Yes, me too.

01:02:21.831 --> 01:02:23.631
- Auntie? - Auntie?

01:02:34.541 --> 01:02:37.511
- What is she doing here? - Hui Gyeong.

01:02:38.881 --> 01:02:40.351
- Hui Gyeong. - Oh, hi!

01:02:40.581 --> 01:02:41.581
Uncle?

01:02:42.621 --> 01:02:43.621
He's your uncle?

01:02:48.161 --> 01:02:49.161
- My gosh. - Oh, gosh!

01:02:49.761 --> 01:02:51.191
What is going on? What's with them?

01:02:51.791 --> 01:02:53.231
I have no idea.

01:02:57.731 --> 01:03:00.501
My gosh, what's wrong with them? What's their deal?

01:03:03.171 --> 01:03:05.311
- What? What's going on? - Auntie.

01:03:06.181 --> 01:03:07.181
What?

01:03:49.051 --> 01:03:51.951
(Recipe for Love)

01:03:52.021 --> 01:03:53.491
- You lost the election... - One, two, three.

01:03:53.561 --> 01:03:55.360
- because people don't like you. - Do this!

01:03:55.361 --> 01:03:58.761
It's a complete misunderstanding. Someone is trying to frame me.

01:03:59.101 --> 01:04:02.731
- So only Dad and Uncle don't know? - Right.

01:04:02.801 --> 01:04:04.931
Goodness gracious. You really scared me.

01:04:05.001 --> 01:04:07.241
I saw my uncle near home.

01:04:08.741 --> 01:04:09.771
Oh, my.

01:04:11.141 --> 01:04:12.981
Don't you ever contact that woman again.

01:04:13.111 --> 01:04:15.611
- I swear I'll do better. - You made the right decision.

01:04:15.811 --> 01:04:18.181
- Get your act together from now on. - I will.

01:04:19.621 --> 01:04:22.021
I really hope it goes well.

01:04:22.251 --> 01:04:23.821
(Yang Dong Ik to the rescue!)

01:04:23.891 --> 01:04:26.761
Do you know who your wife is having an affair with?
