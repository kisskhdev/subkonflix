WEBVTT

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.319
Cuckoo, cuckoo

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:43.280
Cuckoo, cuckoo

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:51.480
Cuckoo, cuckoo

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.439
What are you standing there for?

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:02.519
The bridal sedan chair

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.959
took Xiu Gu away.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.840
Impossible.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.599
Xiu Gu wouldn't go to the Huo family.

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:14.480
She was taken by force.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.279
Xiu Gu!

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:26.320
Xiu Gu!

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.040
Xiu Gu!

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:30.080
What are you shouting for?

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.600
Tell that Huo guy to come out!

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:32.999
Xiu Gu!

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.999
Fat Uncle.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.080
What brings you to my door?

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.999
You're like a fly gathering honey,

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.440
playing dumb, aren't you?

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.360
Where have you hidden Xiu Gu?

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.200
Tell her to come out!

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.160
Hold on, hold on.

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.839
I brought Xiu Gu home as my lawfully wedded wife.

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.480
Now you're at my door,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.480
looking for my wife.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.839
That's a bit unreasonable, isn't it?

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:03.799
Second floor of the winery.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.959
What second floor?

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:10.160
You saw it all, didn't you?

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:11.239
Saw what?

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.080
I didn't see anything.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.239
Xiu Gu

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.440
would never marry you.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.200
This man,

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.920
he has feelings for Xiu Gu.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.040
I can understand that.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.799
After all, Xiu Gu is a good woman.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.519
Otherwise,

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.360
I wouldn't have liked her for so long either.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.920
Right?

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.160
Exactly.

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:29.119
Everyone knows

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:30.679
Xiu Gu is your savior.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.399
How can you harbor

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:33.760
covetous thoughts toward your savior?

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.999
Xiu Gu is my childhood betrothed.

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:38.399
Only I can give her a good life.

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.200
You've only been here a few days.

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:42.119
So I'm warning you.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.880
If you keep pestering my Xiu Gu,

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.839
I won't be polite.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.480
This man is unreasonable.

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:49.360
Tell him to leave.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.320
Go, leave.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.160
It's very simple.

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:53.920
Call Xiu Gu out to say it to my face.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.160
You're being pestering and unreasonable.

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:55.640
See him out.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.119
Stop right there.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.519
What do you want to do?

00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:00.559
Or else?

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:01.959
Or else what will you do?

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:05.880
Fists have no eyes.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.799
Stand back.

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:14.920
Stand back.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.680
Go.

00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:27.919
Stand back.

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:29.240
Back out.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.839
Back up.

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.839
Keep backing up.

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:38.279
This is bullying!

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:41.240
What is going on here?

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:46.399
Nothing, it's nothing.

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:49.359
My relative, we have a little conflict.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.440
Commander Qin knows about it.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.039
I won't cause trouble for him.

00:04:58.479 --> 00:04:59.680
That's enough.

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:00.919
Bandits raided the prison.

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:02.640
Commander Qin is furious right now.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.760
Don't cause extra trouble here.

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:06.359
Understood.

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:08.959
Break it up, break it up.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.120
Break it up, move along.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.640
If you don't release Xiu Gu,

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.959
I'm not leaving.

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:20.279
Suit yourself then.

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:22.399
You just wait here.

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:24.159
Let's see if you can fly to the sky

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:25.359
or burrow into the earth.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.440
Close the door.

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:45.440
I'm not leaving!

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:01.120
Our Qionglai Town intestine noodles,

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.320
outsiders usually don't get to eat them.

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:16.760
Smells so good.

00:07:18.359 --> 00:07:19.839
Don't talk while eating noodles.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.080
You might choke to death.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.760
Choking is better than starving.

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:25.919
I'm not leaving.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.560
I'll find something to eat later.

00:07:30.039 --> 00:07:31.279
I'll wait you out.

00:08:16.919 --> 00:08:18.240
Cinnamon stimulates the appetite

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:22.080
Star anise enhances the fragrance

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.159
The spice is just right

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:35.240
I'm even hungrier now

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.680
You have hot and sour noodles

00:08:44.599 --> 00:08:45.920
I have soup to drink

00:08:52.999 --> 00:08:53.759
Why does it smell so good?

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:54.599
It smells pretty good, huh?

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.839
Let's have a pitch-in meal

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.200
How do we do that?

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.920
I'll provide the soup and stove

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.759
Your rotten vegetable leaves...

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.599
...we cook and eat together

00:09:06.759 --> 00:09:07.400
You don't say

00:09:07.639 --> 00:09:08.800
My belly is getting hungry now

00:09:09.479 --> 00:09:11.080
Tell you what, I'll be generous

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.800
Bring all the leftover veggies to cook

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.160
Bring the good ones too

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:14.920
Cook them all up

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.040
Come on, come on

00:09:16.119 --> 00:09:17.119
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up

00:09:17.759 --> 00:09:18.479
Hungry

00:09:18.639 --> 00:09:19.359
We're all hungry

00:09:19.359 --> 00:09:19.839
Deal

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.599
Brother, what is this?

00:09:30.599 --> 00:09:31.359
Beef offal

00:09:31.639 --> 00:09:32.280
Want to buy some?

00:09:32.479 --> 00:09:33.400
I'm not buying, I'm not buying

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:34.320
Then forget it

00:09:37.759 --> 00:09:39.080
What is that? It smells so good

00:09:41.119 --> 00:09:42.920
How about a pitch-in meal?

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.119
How do we do a pitch-in meal?

00:09:46.119 --> 00:09:47.879
I provide the soup, pot, and stove

00:09:48.359 --> 00:09:49.320
And the tables and benches

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.680
You just provide the beef offal

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:51.599
We eat together

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.080
Sure

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.320
My belly is hungry anyway

00:09:55.839 --> 00:09:56.920
Come on, come on

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.839
Let's eat meat!

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.759
The soup is fragrant, no tummy trouble

00:10:04.839 --> 00:10:05.839
I'll provide the loach

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.800
Herbs are nourishing, just missing tripe

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.920
I'll provide the tripe

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.639
Chicken, duck, fish, meat, anything goes

00:10:12.759 --> 00:10:14.239
Anything goes

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:16.959
Radish, blood curd, and tofu

00:10:16.959 --> 00:10:19.800
Eat tofu, eat tofu

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.520
Pitch-in meal, sit in a circle

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.639
Contribute more...

00:10:23.639 --> 00:10:25.040
...eat more

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.080
Contribute less...

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.520
...still get full

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.599
Contribute nothing, sit comfortably too

00:10:30.599 --> 00:10:32.200
That's right

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.040
Come on, come on

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.639
Cook it up, cook it up

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:44.680
Who are you looking for?

00:10:47.719 --> 00:10:48.479
Come, come

00:10:49.599 --> 00:10:50.239
Come here

00:10:50.719 --> 00:10:51.200
Sit

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:53.999
Is your Young Mistress in?

00:10:54.359 --> 00:10:55.400
Who are you?

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.280
None of your business who I am

00:10:57.359 --> 00:10:58.680
I'm just looking for your Young Mistress

00:11:00.119 --> 00:11:02.080
Our Eldest Young Master hasn't been gone long

00:11:02.479 --> 00:11:04.400
And you dare hit on our Young Mistress?

00:11:04.719 --> 00:11:06.040
Qin Dahan... Qin...

00:11:06.599 --> 00:11:07.959
What are you talking about?

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.719
I'm here to deliver something

00:11:11.239 --> 00:11:12.440
A jar of Qiong wine

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.719
Here, take it, take it

00:11:14.839 --> 00:11:15.920
There's this chubby guy

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.639
Told me to give this letter to your Young Mistress

00:11:18.839 --> 00:11:19.719
I opened it and took a look

00:11:19.719 --> 00:11:20.719
But I didn't understand it

00:11:20.959 --> 00:11:21.959
He repeatedly warned me...

00:11:21.959 --> 00:11:23.320
...not to give it to your Old Master

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.320
You don't look like the Old Master anyway

00:11:25.599 --> 00:11:26.080
Take it

00:11:26.639 --> 00:11:29.599
Stool... Snail... Sound...

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.599
Young Mistress

00:11:31.959 --> 00:11:32.959
Eldest Young Master

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.359
Where is that chubby guy now?

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.359
You mean the chubby guy?

00:11:39.759 --> 00:11:40.639
Where is the chubby guy...

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.200
I'm asking you!

00:11:42.839 --> 00:11:44.200
Don't rush, don't rush, let me think

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.080
I remember now

00:11:51.359 --> 00:11:51.839
Where?

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.359
I came out to buy meat

00:11:53.479 --> 00:11:54.160
I paid the money

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.680
He hasn't given me the meat yet!

00:11:57.839 --> 00:11:59.520
I haven't finished talking, why run?

00:12:27.759 --> 00:12:28.599
Since you're already here...

00:12:29.959 --> 00:12:31.359
Stay for lunch before you go.

00:12:33.959 --> 00:12:34.759
Forget it.

00:12:38.239 --> 00:12:40.040
About this marriage...

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.560
I really don't understand it.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.160
Before the wedding,

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.040
everything was exactly as it should be.

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:48.839
But after she crossed the threshold,

00:12:50.879 --> 00:12:53.599
I'm the Huo family's father-in-law, aren't I?

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.440
How did things end up like this?

00:12:57.839 --> 00:12:59.400
It's been days now.

00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:01.879
I haven't stepped away from here once.

00:13:02.239 --> 00:13:03.920
Xiu Gu has never come out.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.560
Whether she's doing well or not in there,

00:13:06.959 --> 00:13:07.719
nobody knows.

00:13:08.999 --> 00:13:10.479
Why wouldn't she be doing well?

00:13:11.359 --> 00:13:13.879
My son-in-law has always treated her fine.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.560
They grew up together.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.440
Young Master Huo has been sensible since childhood.

00:13:19.479 --> 00:13:20.800
I don't think it's come to that.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.599
I don't want to talk to you about this.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.959
When I rescue Xiu Gu later,

00:13:25.359 --> 00:13:26.639
I'll have her tell you herself.

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.239
Rescue?

00:13:29.839 --> 00:13:31.599
Why would you need to "rescue" her?

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.999
Come out, come out, let Xiugu come out!

00:13:36.239 --> 00:13:39.320
Come out, come out, let Xiugu come out!

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.639
What is going on here?

00:13:40.639 --> 00:13:42.160
Come out, come out, let Xiugu come out!

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.719
These people are here for a pitch-in meal with me.

00:13:43.719 --> 00:13:44.719
We're having hotpot.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.479
They brought their own meat and vegetables.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.479
Some even brought me wine.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.479
Come out, come out, let Xiugu come out!

00:13:51.479 --> 00:13:53.320
Since I'm stuck waiting here anyway,

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.239
anyone who wants to join the pitch-in meal

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.400
has to shout this slogan.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.479
Come out, come out, let Xiugu come out!

00:14:01.719 --> 00:14:04.440
Come out, come out, let Xiugu come out!

00:14:04.599 --> 00:14:06.320
A beggar from out of town

00:14:06.959 --> 00:14:08.280
dares to come to our Huo family turf

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.599
and shame the Huo family name?

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.839
Is he some giant snake we can't pin down?

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.479
When he's done making a scene,

00:14:15.599 --> 00:14:16.520
we'll just spend a little money

00:14:16.759 --> 00:14:19.080
and have Commander Qin charge him with disturbing the peace.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.160
Let him learn that

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.999
our Young Master is red-hot iron—

00:14:21.999 --> 00:14:22.879
you can't even touch him.

00:14:23.119 --> 00:14:24.160
That hits the spot!

00:14:25.639 --> 00:14:27.040
Let him make a scene.

00:14:27.479 --> 00:14:27.999
It's ready!

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.400
Come on in for the pitch-in meal!

00:14:29.479 --> 00:14:31.359
Come on, come on!

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:33.440
Come on, come on!

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.160
Come on, come on!

00:14:36.239 --> 00:14:37.520
You're really something.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.479
With the crowd you draw,

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.160
if you turned this into a business,

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.160
you'd make a fortune.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.320
Exactly.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.080
Boss Dong,

00:14:44.639 --> 00:14:46.719
this might be more profitable than selling wine!

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:47.759
Right, right, right.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.119
If you take your wine

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.200
and sell it here,

00:14:50.359 --> 00:14:51.639
you'll definitely make more money.

00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:53.479
Boss Dong,

00:14:53.719 --> 00:14:54.839
this shop is yours, right?

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.639
Why don't you give it a name?

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:01.719
That's right!

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:03.959
Alright, alright.

00:15:04.639 --> 00:15:05.680
Look here,

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.680
we've all gathered here

00:15:07.759 --> 00:15:08.920
for the love of good food.

00:15:09.599 --> 00:15:11.359
Let's call it "Gourmet Gathering."

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:12.719
Gourmet Gathering?

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:13.719
Sounds good, sounds good!

00:15:14.599 --> 00:15:15.160
Hold on.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:16.920
My surname is Dong.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.400
So let's call it "Dongshihui."

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.920
Great, great, great!

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.400
That works, that works!

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.119
Dongshihui! Dongshihui! Dongshihui!

00:15:27.599 --> 00:15:28.160
Let's eat, let's eat!

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:36.920
Come on down.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:40.920
Hurry!

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:46.479
Over there.

00:15:47.839 --> 00:15:48.999
What do you mean?

00:15:49.239 --> 00:15:50.320
We start from there...

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.639
...and dig a tunnel to the Huo house.

00:15:53.959 --> 00:15:54.839
Dig our way through.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.040
That's a bit extreme.

00:15:57.119 --> 00:15:58.440
Do you want to see Xiu Gu or not?

00:15:59.359 --> 00:16:00.040
Of course.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.999
They won't let us see her.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.839
Don't you think that's strange?

00:16:05.119 --> 00:16:06.680
If we don't dig through from here...

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:07.520
...and find Xiu Gu...

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.560
...how will you know...

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:10.800
...if she's safe...

00:16:10.959 --> 00:16:12.239
...or dead or alive?

00:16:16.359 --> 00:16:18.160
Just the two of us?

00:16:19.879 --> 00:16:21.839
Don't you have a better plan?

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:26.759
The two of us

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.879
Eat hotpot by day

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.999
Dig holes by night

00:16:32.839 --> 00:16:35.080
Fortune telling! Marriage divination!

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.320
No charge if it's not accurate!

00:16:39.239 --> 00:16:39.719
Miss

00:16:39.879 --> 00:16:40.959
Your cheeks are flushed like rosy clouds

00:16:40.959 --> 00:16:42.160
You're about to get lucky in love

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.080
Let me read your fortune

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:44.999
You creep

00:16:44.999 --> 00:16:45.719
Don't go

00:16:45.719 --> 00:16:47.320
That hotpot place is interesting

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.719
The shop is a dump, but the taste is amazing

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:50.440
Indeed

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.560
I heard that chubby boss

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.680
Made a weird rule

00:16:52.959 --> 00:16:54.520
Whoever shouts "Come out, come out"

00:16:54.759 --> 00:16:55.680
Gets a twenty percent discount

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.920
Is the boss's surname Sha?

00:16:58.759 --> 00:16:59.959
Who has the surname Sha?

00:16:59.959 --> 00:17:01.359
It's because he charges so little

00:17:01.359 --> 00:17:02.520
He doesn't make any money at all

00:17:02.719 --> 00:17:03.959
And he looks short and dumpy

00:17:03.959 --> 00:17:05.719
So people call him Boss Sha behind his back

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:08.879
Then why open a hotpot place if not to make money?

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:09.800
Who knows?

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:11.240
Maybe he has his own plans

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:13.280
Excuse me

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.399
Where is this hotpot place you mentioned?

00:17:16.159 --> 00:17:17.760
Up ahead. Dongshihui

00:17:19.679 --> 00:17:21.960
We really want to take you as our master

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.879
I just run this hotpot place for fun

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:26.080
I'm not taking apprentices. No, no

00:17:26.639 --> 00:17:28.080
Not bad at all

00:17:29.879 --> 00:17:30.760
When did you get here?

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.280
You're everywhere

00:17:32.919 --> 00:17:34.199
I divined where you were

00:17:34.839 --> 00:17:36.040
Just accept us

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.879
We sincerely want to learn your craft

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.000
This lousy hotpot

00:17:41.399 --> 00:17:43.520
Doesn't require any craft

00:17:43.639 --> 00:17:45.159
I can't learn anything too difficult either

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.040
We just want a skill to make a living

00:17:49.359 --> 00:17:50.119
Well

00:17:50.359 --> 00:17:51.879
It's not impossible

00:17:53.159 --> 00:17:53.800
Alright, alright

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:56.599
This hotpot looks simple

00:17:56.599 --> 00:17:57.359
But if you want to make it

00:17:57.359 --> 00:17:59.520
Numbing, spicy, fresh, fragrant, and not drying

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:00.240
That is very hard

00:18:00.439 --> 00:18:01.480
The secret recipe inside

00:18:01.599 --> 00:18:03.599
Isn't something you can figure out quickly

00:18:04.839 --> 00:18:06.159
There is no secret recipe

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.280
Just added some herbs

00:18:08.879 --> 00:18:09.560
Not worth much

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.359
Right, not worth much

00:18:11.679 --> 00:18:12.599
But why is it that you

00:18:12.599 --> 00:18:14.159
Can't recreate this flavor?

00:18:16.439 --> 00:18:19.520
Chinese medicine has a hundred flavors; the difficulty is in the balance

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:20.879
The ins and outs of this

00:18:20.879 --> 00:18:23.320
Are profound. There's plenty for you to learn

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.439
Hurry up and call him Master

00:18:25.639 --> 00:18:26.560
Master

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:28.080
That's right

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:29.520
It's almost mealtime

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.040
Go inside and find something to do

00:18:31.879 --> 00:18:32.359
Go in, go in

00:18:32.359 --> 00:18:32.760
Okay

00:18:35.119 --> 00:18:38.240
You with the yellow teeth, faking expertise

00:18:38.639 --> 00:18:40.080
Coming here to cause trouble?

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.480
I'm helping you

00:18:43.119 --> 00:18:44.399
Don't you think this is a business opportunity?

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:45.439
Well

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:47.800
Think about it

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.040
Once you teach the apprentices

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.119
You can open branches

00:18:51.599 --> 00:18:52.599
Apprentices teach more apprentices

00:18:52.679 --> 00:18:53.679
And open more branches

00:18:54.359 --> 00:18:56.320
When branches are blossoming everywhere

00:18:56.639 --> 00:18:58.399
You'll be the Grandmaster

00:18:59.119 --> 00:18:59.919
As the Grandmaster

00:18:59.919 --> 00:19:02.080
You'll just lie at home counting money every day

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.960
Who is this distinguished expert?

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.399
I am Xuanjizi

00:19:08.359 --> 00:19:08.879
Well said

00:19:09.879 --> 00:19:11.040
Well said

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:14.000
I thought only hotpot could make money

00:19:14.359 --> 00:19:15.679
After hearing you say that

00:19:16.159 --> 00:19:18.040
My vision was a bit narrow

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:19.960
Not at all, not at all

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.599
I don't want to be any Grandmaster

00:19:21.919 --> 00:19:23.520
Nor do I want to make money

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:24.839
Don't talk nonsense

00:19:25.199 --> 00:19:26.800
Money is a good thing

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:27.599
Exactly

00:19:27.679 --> 00:19:29.040
If not for money, what are you doing this for?

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.040
I'm doing it to

00:19:30.879 --> 00:19:32.720
Take down the bully across the street

00:19:34.159 --> 00:19:34.599
Bully?

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:35.439
Over there

00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:42.280
That's a pretty lofty ambition.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.119
But you're running on nothing but passion.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.080
You've got no bullets.

00:19:45.399 --> 00:19:45.919
How can you fight?

00:19:46.599 --> 00:19:47.879
Exactly, exactly.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.679
Money is what gives you a backbone.

00:19:50.679 --> 00:19:52.199
We can do both.

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.000
Right, right.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:55.879
Let's do it together.

00:19:56.359 --> 00:19:57.080
Together, together.

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.760
Open a branch, open a branch.

00:19:58.919 --> 00:20:00.000
We can open a branch.

00:20:05.919 --> 00:20:08.000
The bully is right across the street.

00:20:12.439 --> 00:20:14.159
Help me dig into their lair.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.080
Then I'll have time to teach apprentices.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.639
That's the only way to fulfill...

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.480
...your dream of making easy money.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.080
No problem, no problem.

00:20:31.919 --> 00:20:32.439
Together.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:34.679
We're all in this together.

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.439
Did we dig in the wrong direction?

00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:59.839
Impossible.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.760
I know that underneath their house...

00:21:02.159 --> 00:21:04.240
...there is a cellar for tea...

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:05.639
...and a tunnel to escape disaster.

00:21:06.879 --> 00:21:09.280
We just need to dig through to their tunnel...

00:21:09.839 --> 00:21:10.919
...and we'll be through.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.679
Even if they have a tunnel,

00:21:23.119 --> 00:21:24.800
the tunnel should be under the courtyard.

00:21:25.599 --> 00:21:27.679
Their courtyard should be in that direction.

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:30.919
Impossible.

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.480
I think it's right here.

00:21:34.359 --> 00:21:35.320
Is your guess even accurate?

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:36.800
Or is my compass more accurate?

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.439
If we dig wrong, it's all for nothing.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:40.439
Trust me.

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:41.919
This is my trade.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.359
You help out too.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.000
I provide the brains, you provide the brawn.

00:21:49.199 --> 00:21:50.119
Fair and square.

00:21:50.439 --> 00:21:51.000
You...

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.399
What's the situation up ahead?

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:56.800
Queuing for hotpot.

00:21:56.879 --> 00:21:57.679
Hotpot?

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.560
Hotpot is so unrefined.

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:00.480
What's so good about it?

00:22:00.839 --> 00:22:01.599
I find it strange too.

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.560
But there are so many people eating there every day.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:04.919
I'll clear the place immediately.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.040
Clear out, clear out, clear out!

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:07.839
Go, go, go!

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.040
Clear out, clear out, clear out!

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:12.879
Dongshihui.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:13.919
Stop.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:21.240
Two days ago, this Young Master Huo sent gifts.

00:22:21.439 --> 00:22:23.520
Asking me to arrest the boss of Dongshihui.

00:22:24.599 --> 00:22:26.520
It seems this Dongshihui boss...

00:22:26.639 --> 00:22:28.040
...is quite something.

00:22:28.839 --> 00:22:29.639
Move it, move it.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:30.520
Move it.

00:22:33.919 --> 00:22:34.480
Where is everyone?

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:35.599
Why is it all...

00:22:38.439 --> 00:22:40.280
A distinguished guest has arrived.

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:41.760
Clear the tables.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:42.399
Please sit.

00:22:42.399 --> 00:22:43.040
Please, please.

00:22:43.599 --> 00:22:44.599
Sit, sit, sit.

00:22:46.159 --> 00:22:47.480
A tiny hotpot shop.

00:22:47.879 --> 00:22:49.480
Looks pretty ordinary to me.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.040
What signature dishes do you have?

00:22:51.399 --> 00:22:52.080
Our shop...

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.240
Every dish is a signature dish.

00:22:55.839 --> 00:22:57.080
A toad yawning...

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.040
What big talk.

00:22:58.359 --> 00:22:59.599
Then bring a bit of everything.

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:00.439
Alright!

00:23:00.599 --> 00:23:03.320
A bit of every specialty in the house!

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.399
Go personally.

00:23:07.599 --> 00:23:09.080
Commander Qin.

00:23:09.199 --> 00:23:10.280
Your distinguished presence...

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.800
Why didn't you tell me?

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.560
I just stopped by for a hotpot.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.879
No need to disturb Young Master Huo.

00:23:16.599 --> 00:23:17.399
This kind of fly-infested joint...

00:23:17.399 --> 00:23:19.439
Surely can't catch Commander Qin's eye.

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.320
I invite Commander Qin...

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.960
...to my home for a sit-down.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.240
I'll have my chef prepare a good meal for Commander Qin.

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.320
Flies or mosquitoes, it's all meat.

00:23:28.599 --> 00:23:30.080
I came here for its reputation.

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.720
Here it comes!

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:36.240
Dongshihui's authentic spicy hotpot!

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:40.320
What are you doing here?

00:23:40.839 --> 00:23:42.040
We don't welcome you here.

00:23:42.919 --> 00:23:46.280
Come out, come out, let Xiugu come out!

00:23:46.839 --> 00:23:49.960
Come out, come out, let Xiugu come out!

00:23:50.839 --> 00:23:51.560
Commander Qin.

00:23:51.879 --> 00:23:53.919
This is the scoundrel I told you about.

00:23:54.119 --> 00:23:55.399
To steal my woman...

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.960
He opened this fly-infested joint right at my doorstep.

00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:59.399
Spying on me every day.

00:23:59.679 --> 00:24:00.159
Just look.

00:24:00.359 --> 00:24:01.760
Giving my household no peace.

00:24:02.399 --> 00:24:03.639
I request Commander Qin...

00:24:03.919 --> 00:24:05.679
...to purge this peace-disturbing...

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:06.760
...lawless element.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.800
Commander Qin...

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:14.080
The parent official of the local people.

00:24:14.159 --> 00:24:15.720
A good official!

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.359
I want to report a crime too.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:21.240
This man kidnapped a decent woman.

00:24:21.439 --> 00:24:24.199
That is the wife I married with a grand sedan chair.

00:24:24.879 --> 00:24:26.839
You can't have her, so you slander me here.

00:24:27.439 --> 00:24:28.800
Ever since she went in...

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.960
No sign of her, alive or dead.

00:24:31.159 --> 00:24:32.320
Call her out.

00:24:32.599 --> 00:24:33.639
Let's confront her face-to-face.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:35.240
Right.

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:36.800
I came to eat hotpot.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:37.800
You're making such a racket.

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:39.320
Whatever it is, sit down and talk.

00:24:39.679 --> 00:24:40.159
Sit.

00:24:40.359 --> 00:24:41.080
Fine, sit.

00:24:42.359 --> 00:24:43.199
Come, come, come.

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.119
Talk while we eat.

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.199
This hotpot tastes really good.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.080
I think your business is going to get bigger and bigger.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.480
Once the business gets big,

00:24:58.599 --> 00:25:00.760
do you need this officer to do anything for you?

00:25:01.119 --> 00:25:02.000
Yes, yes.

00:25:02.199 --> 00:25:03.919
Tell that bastard to release Xiu Gu.

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:05.399
Xiu Gu?

00:25:06.119 --> 00:25:07.599
Xiu Gu is our young mistress.

00:25:07.879 --> 00:25:09.040
Is her name something you can just shout out?

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:10.839
Right.

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.439
We are all men who do big things.

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.679
Why get so caught up in romance?

00:25:17.359 --> 00:25:18.520
Commander Qin.

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:22.080
This shop was opened for Xiu Gu.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.560
If Xiu Gu isn't here,

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.159
this shop has no meaning at all.

00:25:26.839 --> 00:25:27.839
So you mean...

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:30.119
Xiu Gu is your shop's treasure?

00:25:33.199 --> 00:25:35.520
Then just give Xiu Gu back to them.

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.359
You can just marry another one.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.720
Marry three, I'll be the matchmaker.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.000
Commander Qin.

00:25:42.639 --> 00:25:45.119
You're making things difficult for me.

00:25:46.599 --> 00:25:48.080
Otherwise, what did you think?

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.639
What's going on? Don't wreck the place.

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.480
Easy, easy, easy.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:57.599
What?

00:25:58.639 --> 00:26:00.199
We are...

00:26:00.439 --> 00:26:01.599
Reno... renovating.

00:26:08.119 --> 00:26:08.800
Commander Qin.

00:26:10.839 --> 00:26:13.280
Renovations are loud, might spoil your appetite a bit.

00:26:13.399 --> 00:26:14.040
How about this?

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.080
I'll pack it up and deliver it to your door later.

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.040
What is "packing it up"?

00:26:18.119 --> 00:26:18.960
"Packing it up" means...

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.839
pot, stove, and all the dishes,

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.560
all packed up and delivered to your residence.

00:26:25.159 --> 00:26:27.879
This meal is my tribute to Commander Qin.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:30.639
Sensible.

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.359
You should be sensible too.

00:26:37.879 --> 00:26:38.919
I have high hopes for you.

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.480
Farewell, Commander Qin.

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:48.040
Up!

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.480
She's truly a dwarf crossing a river—dead set on it.

00:27:04.359 --> 00:27:05.960
She hasn't eaten or drunk anything for days.

00:27:07.399 --> 00:27:09.080
She fainted several times in between.

00:27:10.159 --> 00:27:11.280
I told Mama Zhang to forcibly...

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:12.919
pour some sugar water down her throat.

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:14.800
Just to keep her alive.

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.560
This can't go on like this.

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:22.679
I'm afraid... someone might really die.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:39.720
This is the spot.

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:41.839
The height is right too.

00:27:42.359 --> 00:27:43.839
Come on, who's doing the final poke?

00:27:43.839 --> 00:27:44.599
Me, me.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:48.520
Poked it.

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.159
Let there be light!

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:00.720
How come I see the sky?

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:03.879
I don't see a house.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.280
I told you your direction was wrong.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:07.919
The compass can't be wrong.

00:28:09.359 --> 00:28:10.639
This should be the back garden.

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.639
Listen, there are birds chirping.

00:28:14.599 --> 00:28:15.599
Here, let me go up first.

00:28:15.599 --> 00:28:16.199
Come, come, come.

00:28:16.399 --> 00:28:17.000
Stand on this.

00:28:17.199 --> 00:28:17.720
Come, come, come.

00:28:19.359 --> 00:28:20.159
Easy, easy.

00:28:20.599 --> 00:28:21.080
Up.

00:28:21.439 --> 00:28:21.919
Up.

00:28:25.119 --> 00:28:27.280
This is a garden, it is a garden.

00:28:31.159 --> 00:28:32.119
The direction is right.

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:34.839
Why is there a wall?

00:28:37.679 --> 00:28:38.599
Garden...

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.800
Do you see that?

00:28:40.599 --> 00:28:41.919
Dongshihui.

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.080
The direction was dug correctly,

00:28:53.879 --> 00:28:56.800
but the distance is way off.

00:29:07.199 --> 00:29:09.159
What are you guys doing here?

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.119
We...

00:29:12.119 --> 00:29:12.639
We...

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:14.720
We...

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:15.839
Playing hide-and-seek.

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:18.639
Caught you.

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.000
I caught you too.

00:29:20.439 --> 00:29:22.439
You come catch me.

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:26.280
Didn't you want Xiu Gu?

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:29.520
Bring her over.

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:35.800
Come.

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:37.040
Returning her to you.

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.359
Did the Huo family not feed you?

00:29:49.439 --> 00:29:50.720
Don't mention the Huo family ever again.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.359
I went on a hunger strike myself.

00:29:54.119 --> 00:29:55.879
I didn't expect that as soon as I got out,

00:29:55.879 --> 00:29:57.119
you guys would have opened a hotpot restaurant.

00:29:58.439 --> 00:29:59.399
And doing so well too.

00:30:12.599 --> 00:30:14.119
Just look at this hand.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:15.399
Just take a look.

00:30:15.599 --> 00:30:17.199
Look at this hand.

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:21.480
Look how he tortured you.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.599
That bastard, Huo.

00:30:26.399 --> 00:30:27.639
I'm going to settle the score with him.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.280
What score can you settle on your own?

00:30:32.599 --> 00:30:33.159
Xiao Fan

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.960
Let's just let this matter go.

00:30:37.399 --> 00:30:40.439
Young Master Huo caught you then let you go.

00:30:40.679 --> 00:30:42.359
What exactly is his game?

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.399
I can't help but feel...

00:30:44.679 --> 00:30:46.800
...he's plotting some scheme behind our backs.

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.040
We're on the same wavelength.

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.000
We thought the exact same thing.

00:30:52.639 --> 00:30:53.639
This guy named Huo...

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:54.960
I wonder...

00:30:56.159 --> 00:30:58.040
The King of Hell's wife is pregnant.

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:00.760
What devilish scheme is he brewing?

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:03.560
I don't care what devilish scheme he's brewing.

00:31:03.839 --> 00:31:05.679
I'm going to fight him to the end.

00:31:05.679 --> 00:31:06.599
Dad

00:31:08.199 --> 00:31:09.960
Cutting ties with the Huo family...

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:11.439
...is a good thing.

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:14.520
All I want now is...

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:17.639
...to live a peaceful life.
