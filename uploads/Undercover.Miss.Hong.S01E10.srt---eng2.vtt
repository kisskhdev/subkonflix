00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:38.059
{\an8}UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

00:00:53.116 --> 00:00:54.325
{\an8}Stay still.

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:56.744
{\an8}- Hurry up and hand these out too.
- Yes, sir.

00:00:56.828 --> 00:00:58.997
{\an8}- Is it centered?
- It's perfect right now.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.582
{\an8}Hey, this is backwards.

00:01:00.665 --> 00:01:01.666
{\an8}You're looking into a mirror.

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:04.502
{\an8}Oh, you're right. "Over my dead body."

00:01:04.586 --> 00:01:07.463
{\an8}But if I'm being honest,
I support financial reforms.

00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:10.175
{\an8}All of it needs to be upended.

00:01:15.054 --> 00:01:15.889
{\an8}What is it?

00:01:17.182 --> 00:01:18.808
What's that around your head?

00:01:18.892 --> 00:01:20.059
Does it make me look old?

00:01:20.143 --> 00:01:21.394
Man, you're something else.

00:01:21.477 --> 00:01:24.689
Look at you, clawing your way back
to the head office to save your ass.

00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:27.817
How dare you suck on a candy
in front of the director?

00:01:28.818 --> 00:01:30.612
My roommate told me
to eat one at a time like this.

00:01:30.695 --> 00:01:31.529
You got a problem?

00:01:31.613 --> 00:01:33.197
Share if you have extra.

00:01:41.122 --> 00:01:41.956
What's this?

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.833
Resignation…

00:01:48.046 --> 00:01:49.005
Hey, kid.

00:01:49.589 --> 00:01:51.591
That's just how things are
in the real world.

00:01:51.674 --> 00:01:53.760
You need to know
how to own your failures--

00:01:53.843 --> 00:01:55.094
Who said I failed?

00:01:57.055 --> 00:01:58.640
I'm not done yet.

00:02:03.645 --> 00:02:04.854
Why you…

00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:07.523
Please process my resignation quickly.
I'll be off.

00:02:08.107 --> 00:02:08.942
What?

00:02:09.525 --> 00:02:10.818
Hey, take this back…

00:02:10.902 --> 00:02:13.196
Stop! Hong Keum-bo!

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:14.405
Hold on!

00:02:20.453 --> 00:02:21.663
Stop her! Hong Keum-bo!

00:02:21.746 --> 00:02:24.249
Hong Keum-bo! You can't resign!

00:02:24.332 --> 00:02:27.085
Not over my dead body!

00:02:27.168 --> 00:02:28.670
Did Ms. Hong just resign?

00:02:28.753 --> 00:02:29.587
Yeah.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.464
She quit.

00:02:32.382 --> 00:02:33.508
Why is she quitting?

00:02:35.635 --> 00:02:37.679
She must be getting married.
That has to be it.

00:02:38.554 --> 00:02:40.765
An older single woman
would only quit like that

00:02:40.848 --> 00:02:42.600
when she's getting married.

00:02:46.688 --> 00:02:47.522
Taxi!

00:02:53.528 --> 00:02:55.905
- Damn it.
- Hong!

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.366
Sir, take me to Hanmin's head office.
I'll pay you double.

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:00.118
Hong, wait! Stop!

00:03:02.787 --> 00:03:04.664
- Oh no.
- Why you…

00:03:11.337 --> 00:03:12.547
I'm coming with you.

00:03:13.047 --> 00:03:15.967
Damn it! Who said you could quit?

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.177
- Put your seatbelt on.
- What? Seatbelt?

00:03:18.261 --> 00:03:20.930
Who cares about seatbelts right now?

00:03:21.014 --> 00:03:22.098
Why won't this pull out?

00:03:22.765 --> 00:03:25.977
Hey, are you protesting
because things didn't go your way?

00:03:26.811 --> 00:03:28.730
This country's economy is in peril.

00:03:28.813 --> 00:03:30.732
Nobody cares about
a chairman embezzling money.

00:03:31.315 --> 00:03:32.900
They're not going to pursue it!

00:03:33.568 --> 00:03:34.902
How can you not understand that?

00:03:34.986 --> 00:03:36.154
Given the economic crisis,

00:03:36.237 --> 00:03:40.116
they're willing to let charges like
illegal slush funds and tax evasion slide.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.203
Turning a blind eye like this
only lets the big crooks run wild.

00:03:44.871 --> 00:03:47.498
The higher-ups letting them slide
are basically accomplices.

00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:48.875
Accomplices?

00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.002
You must be joking. Watch it!

00:03:51.961 --> 00:03:54.922
INVESTMENT AGREEMENT
INVESTMENT AMOUNT: 300 BILLION WON

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:00.053
KANG PIL-BEOM

00:04:06.434 --> 00:04:07.268
All right.

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:14.609
KANG PIL-BEOM

00:04:18.404 --> 00:04:19.405
Here.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.243
My goodness.

00:04:25.286 --> 00:04:27.163
Thank you.

00:04:28.164 --> 00:04:29.415
- Great.
- Thank you, sir.

00:04:31.209 --> 00:04:32.835
It was a pleasure.

00:04:34.545 --> 00:04:35.546
Thanks.

00:04:51.104 --> 00:04:54.190
Chairman Kang won't change his mind
now that the smoke's cleared, right?

00:04:54.774 --> 00:04:57.652
Hanmin can't even cover
the promissory notes due in two weeks.

00:04:57.735 --> 00:04:58.903
They keep up appearances,

00:04:58.986 --> 00:05:00.822
but they're a house of cards
at this point.

00:05:02.198 --> 00:05:03.616
Even now,

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:07.036
I think your decision
to target Korea next was spot-on.

00:05:08.621 --> 00:05:11.332
I guess you enjoyed the report
from the "advance scout."

00:05:11.916 --> 00:05:13.126
Most definitely.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.546
Chairman Kang may try to rein us in later,

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:18.297
given that he's naturally distrustful.

00:05:18.381 --> 00:05:21.968
I'll have the shell company we set up
start buying up bonds as well.

00:05:23.094 --> 00:05:24.178
Okay.

00:05:24.762 --> 00:05:27.473
Are there any issues
like someone you're wary of?

00:05:29.308 --> 00:05:30.309
There was someone,

00:05:31.477 --> 00:05:32.311
but I took care of it.

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:37.400
The IMF crisis has emerged

00:05:37.483 --> 00:05:41.070
as a major variable,
shaking up the 15th presidential election.

00:05:41.571 --> 00:05:44.782
The candidates continue to fiercely debate
over who bears responsibility,

00:05:44.866 --> 00:05:48.661
calling for a reckoning
within both parties and pressing voters

00:05:48.744 --> 00:05:50.580
to demand accountability
at the ballot box.

00:05:51.164 --> 00:05:52.206
Experts say major variables

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.251
will remain in flux
until the election's final days.

00:05:55.334 --> 00:05:57.295
As we reach the final stretch…

00:05:57.378 --> 00:05:58.921
I'm going to become a major variable.

00:05:59.005 --> 00:06:00.423
Sir, you can drop me off up ahead,

00:06:00.506 --> 00:06:02.967
and please drive him back to the FSS.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.719
Where are we?

00:06:04.802 --> 00:06:05.636
Hey, where are we?

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.389
What about the fare?
I didn't bring my wallet.

00:06:08.973 --> 00:06:11.642
Just call Nam Dong-gi down
once you've arrived at the office.

00:06:12.393 --> 00:06:13.436
Hey! Hold on a second.

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:15.646
- Sir, can't you roll the window down?
- Bye.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.565
Hey, wait! Hong!

00:06:17.648 --> 00:06:19.692
I hope you trip and fall!

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:21.986
Hong Keum-bo!

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:31.454
EPISODE 10: CLASH OF THE TITANS

00:06:32.538 --> 00:06:35.249
I went into the FSS today

00:06:35.875 --> 00:06:37.251
and saw Hong Keum-bo.

00:06:37.752 --> 00:06:38.586
It's her.

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:42.632
She's the one that came to the auto shop
with Chairman Kang's grandson.

00:06:43.549 --> 00:06:44.425
Really?

00:06:45.092 --> 00:06:47.011
She came in today
and handed in her resignation.

00:06:48.262 --> 00:06:51.474
People were talking about
her getting married or something.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.728
Her boss followed her out
and begged her to stay,

00:06:55.811 --> 00:06:57.438
but she never looked back once.

00:06:58.147 --> 00:07:00.024
She must've known it was a lost cause.

00:07:00.775 --> 00:07:02.485
It seems she's not a complete idiot.

00:07:03.486 --> 00:07:06.155
But how does Hong Keum-bo and Albert Oh

00:07:06.989 --> 00:07:08.407
know each other?

00:07:09.116 --> 00:07:10.284
Well?

00:07:10.368 --> 00:07:12.870
Should I dig deeper into Hong Keum-bo?

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:16.958
What could she possibly do
without her title?

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.051
No.

00:07:29.929 --> 00:07:32.390
Her car must have been there for a reason.

00:07:34.016 --> 00:07:35.893
Try tailing Albert.

00:07:37.144 --> 00:07:39.188
We need concrete evidence
to get rid of Albert

00:07:39.772 --> 00:07:42.275
and ensure a sure push for Nora
as the next president.

00:08:27.612 --> 00:08:28.654
EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

00:08:28.738 --> 00:08:30.364
This is your new employment contract.

00:08:32.033 --> 00:08:33.784
Even amid difficult economic conditions,

00:08:33.868 --> 00:08:36.454
we fought to preserve jobs
for our female staff,

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.291
but the recent round of restructuring
was an inevitable decision.

00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.711
We hope you understand
that these new measures are designed

00:08:43.794 --> 00:08:47.882
to strengthen internal cohesion
and help prevent future layoffs.

00:08:48.674 --> 00:08:51.218
"Contract employment.
Terminable at any time."

00:08:51.302 --> 00:08:53.304
"One female employee for three divisions."

00:08:54.889 --> 00:08:56.724
So they'll work us to the bone, huh?

00:08:56.807 --> 00:08:59.518
After stamping your seal or thumbprint,
leave the contracts here

00:09:00.519 --> 00:09:01.979
and return to your divisions.

00:09:03.522 --> 00:09:05.066
Collect them and bring them to me.

00:09:05.149 --> 00:09:06.609
Yes, ma'am.

00:09:21.582 --> 00:09:24.418
Being away from your post too long
will reflect poorly on all of us.

00:09:24.502 --> 00:09:26.629
Stamp your seals and return at once.

00:09:37.848 --> 00:09:39.225
What if it didn't burn?

00:09:41.435 --> 00:09:44.188
By the will of the heavens,
it ended up in my hands.

00:09:47.108 --> 00:09:48.442
Not a chance, Queen Bee.

00:09:50.361 --> 00:09:52.530
You'll be laden with honors
if you return with that.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.864
No.

00:09:54.448 --> 00:09:55.574
I'm going to steal it all.

00:09:56.826 --> 00:09:57.827
Are you in?

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:02.164
You're not reporting it to the FSS?

00:10:02.832 --> 00:10:05.793
I already did, but the higher-ups
have no intention to pursue it.

00:10:06.711 --> 00:10:08.546
Given that we're in an economic crisis,

00:10:08.629 --> 00:10:10.589
corporate corruption
is apparently off the table.

00:10:11.716 --> 00:10:13.634
The higher-ups are always the issue.

00:10:14.218 --> 00:10:16.053
I want to steal all of this money

00:10:16.137 --> 00:10:19.056
to oust the corrupt controlling
shareholder and complicit executives,

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.933
and save Hanmin's employees.

00:10:22.852 --> 00:10:24.854
You saw the ledger,
so you know I can't do it alone.

00:10:25.479 --> 00:10:28.441
You said you only went after dirty money.

00:10:30.985 --> 00:10:32.611
Then again, Hanmin's slush fund

00:10:33.404 --> 00:10:35.322
is the dirtiest money I've ever seen.

00:10:37.491 --> 00:10:40.202
You have three days to decide.
I hope you're in.

00:10:40.953 --> 00:10:41.787
Also,

00:10:41.871 --> 00:10:43.622
I can stay with Mi-sook tonight.

00:10:44.165 --> 00:10:45.207
I'm off to work now.

00:11:01.474 --> 00:11:02.892
{\an8}EMPLOYEE NAME: HONG…

00:11:43.599 --> 00:11:46.602
Didn't you say Hong Keum-bo would return
to the FSS on December 8th?

00:11:46.685 --> 00:11:47.811
{\an8}LETTER OF RESIGNATION

00:11:48.562 --> 00:11:51.899
I have that kid to blame
for my migraine right now.

00:11:52.483 --> 00:11:54.318
She showed up at the office today

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.862
and threw a resignation letter in my face.

00:11:56.946 --> 00:11:58.155
A resignation letter?

00:12:00.282 --> 00:12:01.367
Director Yun.

00:12:01.951 --> 00:12:03.577
Are you sure
you're not hatching another plan?

00:12:03.661 --> 00:12:06.080
You put her to work again, didn't you?

00:12:07.498 --> 00:12:08.832
Why you little…

00:12:09.333 --> 00:12:10.668
You think she'd listen to me?

00:12:10.751 --> 00:12:11.835
Don't you know her?

00:12:12.336 --> 00:12:15.756
I wouldn't even be talking
if I had some sort of decent plan.

00:12:15.839 --> 00:12:17.716
What could she even do there by herself?

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.052
She's just being stubborn right now!

00:12:20.719 --> 00:12:23.180
Don't get me riled up.
It's making my headache worse.

00:12:25.474 --> 00:12:28.102
She won't even answer my calls right now.

00:12:28.185 --> 00:12:31.939
Can you just sweet-talk her
into coming back here?

00:12:32.022 --> 00:12:34.525
- Director Yun!
- Just utilize your charm.

00:12:34.608 --> 00:12:35.776
I'm sure you can do it.

00:12:35.859 --> 00:12:38.112
Jeez, could you be any more frustrating?

00:12:44.076 --> 00:12:44.952
Damn it.

00:12:48.872 --> 00:12:52.418
{\an8}SUCCESS WILL NOT WAIT FOR YOU

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.145
Why are you cracking a book here
when you've never been much of a reader?

00:13:12.438 --> 00:13:15.774
You're surprisingly relentless
with maintaining your public image.

00:13:15.858 --> 00:13:17.276
You're 17 minutes late.

00:13:17.359 --> 00:13:18.319
I don't have much time.

00:13:18.402 --> 00:13:19.403
I'll give you ten minutes.

00:13:19.987 --> 00:13:21.447
I must say I'm curious.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:24.033
Why did you ask to see me out here?

00:13:24.116 --> 00:13:27.244
We're under constant surveillance
at the office and at the house.

00:13:28.454 --> 00:13:29.330
I'm talking about Oh Deok-gyu.

00:13:30.539 --> 00:13:31.373
Oh Deok-gyu?

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.878
He's been flipping out
ever since my daughter and I moved in.

00:13:35.961 --> 00:13:38.589
He might have a hulking body
and giant bug eyes,

00:13:38.672 --> 00:13:40.257
but he's the pettiest man alive.

00:13:40.841 --> 00:13:43.719
I'm thinking about securing a position
for Ms. Kang at the company.

00:13:44.595 --> 00:13:46.430
Why? Did the chairman tell you to?

00:13:47.598 --> 00:13:50.934
You're scared you'll be kicked out
if Oh Deok-gyu becomes president,

00:13:51.935 --> 00:13:54.021
so you'll use Nora and me
to shield yourself?

00:13:54.647 --> 00:13:56.148
We're in the same boat.

00:13:57.024 --> 00:13:59.818
After all, Mr. Oh's nemesis is you.

00:14:01.153 --> 00:14:03.197
I can persuade the chairman.

00:14:04.615 --> 00:14:07.910
How about officially introducing
Ms. Kang to the company

00:14:08.535 --> 00:14:12.122
with a carefully crafted résumé
that's impressive enough to position her

00:14:12.706 --> 00:14:13.999
as a successor?

00:14:16.085 --> 00:14:17.461
Hold on a second.

00:14:17.544 --> 00:14:19.546
Since Albert is a division manager,

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:21.340
my Nora should be ranked higher.

00:14:21.423 --> 00:14:22.675
Give her something higher.

00:14:22.758 --> 00:14:24.385
And she should have her own big office.

00:14:26.053 --> 00:14:28.180
Let's discuss the details over a meal.

00:14:28.764 --> 00:14:29.807
Shall we?

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:31.266
Then I'll have the full-course meal.

00:14:33.352 --> 00:14:34.186
Okay.

00:14:34.269 --> 00:14:35.104
Excuse me.

00:14:41.276 --> 00:14:43.153
RISK MANAGEMENT, RESEARCH,
CONFERENCE ROOM

00:14:48.909 --> 00:14:50.202
FEMALE STAFF DUTY ASSIGNMENT

00:14:50.285 --> 00:14:51.578
HONG JANG-MI: RESEARCH, TRADING, IT

00:14:58.877 --> 00:15:00.629
RECEIPTS FOR EXPENSE REPORTS

00:15:04.508 --> 00:15:07.302
Hong Jang-mi, you dared to humiliate me?

00:15:08.721 --> 00:15:11.765
An amateur would've wiped you out
with the rest of the layoffs.

00:15:11.849 --> 00:15:14.768
However, I'm more than that.

00:15:14.852 --> 00:15:18.564
I'll pay back that day's humiliation
with double the interest.

00:15:25.529 --> 00:15:27.656
Have this translated
by 8:30 a.m. tomorrow.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.199
Hey!

00:15:29.283 --> 00:15:31.535
The company is struggling,
yet you're wasting paper.

00:15:31.618 --> 00:15:33.245
Use scrap paper for that.

00:15:33.328 --> 00:15:34.872
I am using scrap paper.

00:15:34.955 --> 00:15:35.789
Hey!

00:15:36.331 --> 00:15:38.250
Look at all those numbers.

00:15:38.333 --> 00:15:41.128
Security is essential.
You can't just use any old document.

00:15:42.546 --> 00:15:43.464
Seriously?

00:15:43.547 --> 00:15:45.299
Does he expect me to harvest papyrus then?

00:15:47.718 --> 00:15:48.886
Stop glaring.

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:51.013
Ms. Hong, you're always…

00:15:51.096 --> 00:15:52.264
Just look at all this.

00:15:52.347 --> 00:15:54.767
You're always unprepared
for even your basic duties.

00:16:02.816 --> 00:16:05.736
From nine to noon, the Research Division.

00:16:05.819 --> 00:16:08.322
From noon to three, the Trading Division.

00:16:08.405 --> 00:16:09.698
And from three to six, the IT Division.

00:16:09.782 --> 00:16:11.784
Those are my assigned duty hours.

00:16:12.367 --> 00:16:14.953
If you'll excuse me,
I'll head to the Trading Division now.

00:16:17.915 --> 00:16:18.957
Hey!

00:16:19.041 --> 00:16:21.418
You don't get to tell me when you work!

00:16:21.502 --> 00:16:23.045
You'll work after hours if you have to.

00:16:23.879 --> 00:16:27.800
Why should I devote my time to a company
that could drop me at a moment's notice?

00:16:29.635 --> 00:16:30.928
What the…

00:16:34.306 --> 00:16:35.766
Get back to work.

00:16:38.769 --> 00:16:43.565
I swear, one day,
I'll wipe that smugness off your face,

00:16:43.649 --> 00:16:45.567
even if it's the last thing I do here.

00:16:45.651 --> 00:16:46.777
Damn it.

00:16:54.326 --> 00:16:57.996
Shouldn't we check with the boss
whether to scale back trading on this?

00:16:58.956 --> 00:17:00.666
Come on, what would Stoobert know?

00:17:01.458 --> 00:17:02.459
Who's "Stoobert"?

00:17:03.836 --> 00:17:05.420
Albert the "Stooge" Division Manager.

00:17:06.004 --> 00:17:07.714
"Stoobert" for short.

00:17:23.313 --> 00:17:24.273
Hello?

00:17:32.614 --> 00:17:34.408
Why make me come all the way here?

00:17:35.534 --> 00:17:37.786
Director Yun told you to return
on December 8th.

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:39.496
Why are you still here?

00:17:40.497 --> 00:17:42.457
You care way too much
about other people's jobs.

00:17:43.041 --> 00:17:46.295
Ms. Song has hired someone
to go after Hong Keum-bo,

00:17:46.378 --> 00:17:48.672
so get out of here
before you land yourself in trouble.

00:17:50.757 --> 00:17:53.886
I should've insisted on firing you
during the restructuring.

00:17:55.137 --> 00:17:56.430
You really are the worst.

00:17:56.972 --> 00:17:58.932
You'd fire me over a personal vendetta?

00:17:59.016 --> 00:18:00.475
Personal?

00:18:00.559 --> 00:18:03.437
I'm only trying to eliminate
a risk factor as management.

00:18:04.813 --> 00:18:08.358
Did it ever occur to you that I could
easily expose you for identity theft?

00:18:09.735 --> 00:18:11.278
No, never.

00:18:12.863 --> 00:18:16.033
You'll also be in trouble
if people learn about our past together.

00:18:16.116 --> 00:18:18.035
Maybe you've been abroad for too long,

00:18:18.118 --> 00:18:20.704
but Koreans eat up romantic entanglement.

00:18:20.787 --> 00:18:21.872
Romantic entanglement?

00:18:21.955 --> 00:18:25.542
The moment you expose my identity,
you'd be blowing yourself up too.

00:18:27.336 --> 00:18:28.962
Unless you want messy gossip around you

00:18:29.046 --> 00:18:32.007
and end up on Chairman Kang's bad side,
keep your mouth shut.

00:18:32.633 --> 00:18:34.760
This is a threat, just so you know.

00:18:42.517 --> 00:18:44.353
What is she thinking?

00:18:48.899 --> 00:18:49.858
Chairman.

00:18:50.359 --> 00:18:52.778
They say vitamins
help you feel energized in the morning.

00:18:52.861 --> 00:18:54.321
- Enjoy.
- Jeez.

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:56.031
Let's see.

00:19:02.454 --> 00:19:03.664
It's not bad.

00:19:03.747 --> 00:19:04.581
Right?

00:19:06.416 --> 00:19:07.709
Right.

00:19:07.793 --> 00:19:11.004
It looks like
Nora's still off in dreamland.

00:19:12.214 --> 00:19:13.840
Did she forget she now lives with elders?

00:19:13.924 --> 00:19:16.301
She still has a lot of growing up to do.

00:19:16.802 --> 00:19:18.804
Beauties run on extra sleep,
didn't you know?

00:19:20.806 --> 00:19:23.892
Albert must get his looks from his mother.

00:19:23.976 --> 00:19:26.019
He wouldn't be falling asleep
if he took after his dad.

00:19:28.397 --> 00:19:30.274
I wasn't sleeping!

00:19:32.109 --> 00:19:33.944
Oh, right.

00:19:34.027 --> 00:19:36.488
Have you set a date
for Nora's first day of work?

00:19:37.906 --> 00:19:41.285
She'll be starting next Monday,
and we're preparing a press release.

00:19:41.368 --> 00:19:42.577
Good.

00:19:42.661 --> 00:19:44.371
What? Nora's first day?

00:19:45.163 --> 00:19:46.123
At our company?

00:19:46.206 --> 00:19:47.082
No.

00:19:47.833 --> 00:19:50.085
Not at your company, but at our company.

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:53.714
We live in a competitive society.

00:19:54.881 --> 00:19:58.760
The sharpest one with the most potential

00:19:58.844 --> 00:20:00.595
will become my successor.

00:20:01.179 --> 00:20:02.347
Of course.

00:20:09.146 --> 00:20:09.980
Oh gosh.

00:20:28.332 --> 00:20:30.751
Ms. Kang will be
starting work here next week.

00:20:32.294 --> 00:20:34.212
She'll be a director, not a staff member,

00:20:34.296 --> 00:20:35.297
so she'll need her own office.

00:20:36.965 --> 00:20:39.551
Madam Choi will inspect it closely
and be ready to nitpick,

00:20:39.634 --> 00:20:41.511
so make sure it's properly set up.

00:20:42.596 --> 00:20:44.056
Yes, ma'am.

00:20:46.725 --> 00:20:50.729
She'll be frequenting the 12th floor
to prepare for Ms. Kang's engagement.

00:20:51.521 --> 00:20:55.275
Just let Admin and the front desk know
about Madam Choi's visits.

00:20:55.359 --> 00:20:56.485
An engagement?

00:20:57.152 --> 00:20:58.236
With President Shin?

00:21:08.455 --> 00:21:09.956
You saw her this morning.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:13.835
As if that ditzy, naive girl
could ever become a successor.

00:21:13.919 --> 00:21:17.881
Kang Nora's mere existence is
nowhere near meeting the qualifications.

00:21:17.964 --> 00:21:19.508
I'm not exactly qualified either.

00:21:20.258 --> 00:21:22.386
Son, have some confidence.

00:21:22.469 --> 00:21:23.720
Be a man.

00:21:23.804 --> 00:21:24.679
Dad.

00:21:24.763 --> 00:21:26.723
I just know myself and my place well.

00:21:26.807 --> 00:21:27.682
Why you…

00:21:30.644 --> 00:21:33.647
We need to deal with Kang Nora
pushing her way in.

00:21:34.356 --> 00:21:35.816
I mean, she's about to be engaged,

00:21:35.899 --> 00:21:38.026
so why does she suddenly need a new title?

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:39.027
Oh, boy.

00:21:39.111 --> 00:21:42.030
If President Shin joins her side,
things will get messy.

00:21:45.909 --> 00:21:47.994
The patient's name is Kim Mi-sook, right?

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:51.415
- Yes.
- Here's the total amount due.

00:21:51.498 --> 00:21:52.582
{\an8}MEDICAL EXPENSE STATEMENT
TO BE PAID: 674,500 WON

00:22:02.717 --> 00:22:03.802
I'll pay the full amount.

00:22:04.511 --> 00:22:05.345
Sure.

00:22:19.359 --> 00:22:20.485
She paid the hospital bill.

00:22:22.112 --> 00:22:25.115
As if it's not infuriating enough
that his daughter was right under my nose.

00:22:26.032 --> 00:22:28.910
Hospital fees are really expensive.

00:22:28.994 --> 00:22:30.829
Besides, Mi-sook and I were really close.

00:22:32.455 --> 00:22:34.457
The father claims
the company played no part,

00:22:35.041 --> 00:22:36.543
while his daughter pays the hospital bill.

00:22:36.626 --> 00:22:38.128
Are you playing arsonist and firefighter?

00:22:38.962 --> 00:22:40.881
It's all Kang Pil-beom's money anyway.

00:22:40.964 --> 00:22:42.757
Do you know how he made all that money?

00:22:43.425 --> 00:22:44.718
How did he make it…

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:46.094
ma'am?

00:22:46.553 --> 00:22:47.596
How do you know, big sis?

00:22:47.679 --> 00:22:48.889
Don't call me that.

00:22:48.972 --> 00:22:50.348
But you're ten years older than me.

00:22:50.432 --> 00:22:51.892
Both of you, stop it.

00:22:52.559 --> 00:22:53.602
Let her pay.

00:22:53.685 --> 00:22:55.729
That won't even make a dent
in her account.

00:23:08.533 --> 00:23:10.577
{\an8}STRICT BED REST
KIM MI-SOOK

00:23:24.549 --> 00:23:25.717
Mi-sook…

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.552
Besides, Mi-sook and I were really close.

00:23:50.492 --> 00:23:52.994
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

00:23:53.078 --> 00:23:54.204
Kang Nora?

00:23:54.287 --> 00:23:55.372
Who's that?

00:23:55.455 --> 00:23:56.456
Who could she be?

00:23:59.834 --> 00:24:02.003
NOTICE OF NEW APPOINTMENT:
EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 15, 1997

00:24:02.087 --> 00:24:04.297
{\an8}NAME: KANG NORA
POSITION: DIRECTOR

00:24:29.781 --> 00:24:31.491
Myeong-hwi and I were close friends.

00:24:32.826 --> 00:24:34.035
Any sister of his

00:24:34.577 --> 00:24:35.996
is a sister of mine too.

00:24:37.122 --> 00:24:40.166
I wonder if that princess over there
feels the same way.

00:24:42.002 --> 00:24:45.672
You know,
she looks familiar for some reason.

00:24:45.755 --> 00:24:47.007
TO THE WORLD, TO THE FUTURE
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

00:25:01.146 --> 00:25:02.772
She was the chairman's only daughter?

00:25:02.856 --> 00:25:03.690
I'm so jealous.

00:25:04.482 --> 00:25:05.775
She'll inherit the company, right?

00:25:06.943 --> 00:25:07.819
Is she married?

00:25:07.902 --> 00:25:10.405
I don't know about that,
but I read on Yeouido Pirates

00:25:10.488 --> 00:25:12.657
that she used to be a successful
Wall Street fund manager.

00:25:12.741 --> 00:25:13.575
Really?

00:25:14.576 --> 00:25:15.744
What a joke.

00:25:19.122 --> 00:25:20.290
Congratulations.

00:25:20.373 --> 00:25:21.207
Thank you.

00:25:24.044 --> 00:25:24.961
Oh, right.

00:25:26.713 --> 00:25:28.381
- It's an honor to serve you.
- I'm honored.

00:25:28.465 --> 00:25:29.883
- Congratulations.
- You too.

00:25:29.966 --> 00:25:31.843
- Congratulations.
- Yes, congratulations.

00:25:31.926 --> 00:25:33.887
- I'll do my very best!
- I'll do my best too.

00:25:34.971 --> 00:25:35.805
Hello.

00:25:40.894 --> 00:25:44.773
Kang Eun-joo got a score of 210…

00:25:45.607 --> 00:25:46.691
I mean, 21 points.

00:25:47.317 --> 00:25:48.318
Apple!

00:25:48.818 --> 00:25:51.112
It's Apple.

00:25:51.196 --> 00:25:53.615
The clueless entry-level minion
from the Trading Division?

00:25:53.698 --> 00:25:56.117
And the lowest score on the written exam?

00:25:56.201 --> 00:25:57.577
It's you? Ma'am?

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.037
Hello, sir.

00:26:02.499 --> 00:26:04.626
Who are you calling clueless?

00:26:04.709 --> 00:26:06.669
So what if she scored the lowest?

00:26:06.753 --> 00:26:08.088
Forget it. You may all leave.

00:26:08.671 --> 00:26:09.631
Go on, leave.

00:26:09.714 --> 00:26:11.424
The written…

00:26:22.227 --> 00:26:24.104
Don't let it upset you, my darling.

00:26:24.813 --> 00:26:26.940
What should we have for lunch?

00:26:27.023 --> 00:26:28.066
Should we call Mr. Shin?

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:30.777
No, I don't have an appetite.

00:26:31.361 --> 00:26:32.195
What?

00:26:33.321 --> 00:26:34.155
Gosh.

00:26:35.156 --> 00:26:36.324
You don't have an appetite?

00:26:37.158 --> 00:26:37.992
That's great.

00:26:38.076 --> 00:26:40.954
Let's go all out for this diet.

00:26:43.123 --> 00:26:43.957
Nora.

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.127
If anyone bothers you at work
or gives you a hard time,

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:48.378
just let me know.

00:26:49.254 --> 00:26:52.632
There's nothing I can't do
if it's for you.

00:26:57.387 --> 00:27:00.932
Ms. Song Ju-ran and I are joining forces

00:27:01.015 --> 00:27:03.268
to make sure you become the chairwoman.

00:27:03.977 --> 00:27:06.062
So do as she says, okay?

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.106
Okay.

00:27:08.815 --> 00:27:09.774
That's my girl.

00:27:48.688 --> 00:27:50.315
Queen Bee, have you been well?

00:27:52.108 --> 00:27:53.735
I'm back to work starting today.

00:27:53.818 --> 00:27:55.361
We ran into each other earlier.

00:27:57.197 --> 00:27:58.573
Director Kang Nora.

00:28:00.033 --> 00:28:02.660
Have you ratted out
Hong Jang-mi or Go Bok-hee

00:28:02.744 --> 00:28:04.245
to your mother?

00:28:04.996 --> 00:28:07.290
No, I'm surprisingly loyal.

00:28:08.583 --> 00:28:10.502
I do hope you remain loyal.

00:28:11.085 --> 00:28:12.337
Especially

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:13.630
when it comes to Hong Jang-mi.

00:28:19.511 --> 00:28:20.803
By the way,

00:28:21.554 --> 00:28:23.056
is Bom doing all right?

00:28:23.806 --> 00:28:24.682
Does she ask for me?

00:28:30.063 --> 00:28:31.064
She does not, ma'am.

00:28:44.702 --> 00:28:49.415
FEMALE EMPLOYEES' LOCKER ROOM

00:28:55.004 --> 00:28:56.297
Where is Bom right now?

00:29:12.564 --> 00:29:15.191
Why would the director,
who doesn't even wear a uniform,

00:29:15.275 --> 00:29:16.401
come in here?

00:29:17.443 --> 00:29:20.655
Just do as your parents say
and behave yourself on the 12th floor.

00:29:22.407 --> 00:29:23.741
You're worried about Bom?

00:29:23.825 --> 00:29:26.411
You left with your mom
and never looked back!

00:29:39.924 --> 00:29:42.051
You're no better
than the trio who bullied you!

00:29:42.635 --> 00:29:43.469
You're so mean.

00:29:44.178 --> 00:29:46.598
I'll find Bom and bring her to my place!

00:29:46.681 --> 00:29:47.682
Hey!

00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:50.310
That little…

00:30:01.446 --> 00:30:02.280
Ms. Hong.

00:30:03.907 --> 00:30:04.824
Are you working late?

00:30:06.576 --> 00:30:08.494
Big Al, aren't you going home?

00:30:30.433 --> 00:30:31.267
I used to complain

00:30:31.851 --> 00:30:34.103
that this office
felt like some tiny rented room,

00:30:35.021 --> 00:30:36.522
but now I find it so comforting.

00:30:52.747 --> 00:30:54.165
This is the first time I'm speaking today.

00:30:54.916 --> 00:30:57.251
The Trading Division
treats me like I'm invisible.

00:30:58.378 --> 00:31:00.713
Ms. Hong, I heard
you work for three divisions now.

00:31:01.214 --> 00:31:02.382
Isn't it tough?

00:31:02.465 --> 00:31:03.841
I'm just doing what I have to.

00:31:03.925 --> 00:31:05.051
I'll have to get used to it.

00:31:12.183 --> 00:31:13.768
You're still the head of a division.

00:31:13.851 --> 00:31:15.478
You should hold weekly meetings

00:31:15.561 --> 00:31:17.897
and offer encouraging words
in the morning.

00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:20.942
I overheard in the men's room

00:31:21.025 --> 00:31:23.403
that when the traders see you come in,

00:31:23.486 --> 00:31:26.155
that's how they know it's nine o'clock
and get to work.

00:31:26.239 --> 00:31:28.241
You know I'm never late.

00:31:28.324 --> 00:31:29.450
Right, Mr. Bang?

00:31:40.044 --> 00:31:41.379
I should head out now.

00:31:46.092 --> 00:31:47.093
Get home safe.

00:31:48.219 --> 00:31:49.053
Goodbye, Ms. Hong.

00:31:54.851 --> 00:31:57.645
Ms. Hong is so mature for her age.

00:32:00.148 --> 00:32:02.859
She has experience and wisdom
that a 20-year-old can't have.

00:32:02.942 --> 00:32:04.110
Yeah.

00:32:04.193 --> 00:32:05.611
She's quite big-hearted too.

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:09.240
She seems cold on the outside,
but her heart remains warm.

00:32:09.323 --> 00:32:11.117
She really feels like
the senior sometimes.

00:32:11.743 --> 00:32:13.536
Yeah, I agree.

00:32:16.873 --> 00:32:17.915
Show respect to your senior.

00:32:18.833 --> 00:32:19.709
Senior?

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.298
That day, Mr. Bang definitely said…

00:32:25.381 --> 00:32:27.717
He said she was senior to us.

00:32:29.594 --> 00:32:30.928
- No way.
- Come on now.

00:32:31.012 --> 00:32:32.638
- Of course not.
- How could she be?

00:32:32.722 --> 00:32:33.598
Come on now.

00:32:34.348 --> 00:32:35.683
Gosh, Mr. Bang can be so silly.

00:32:52.075 --> 00:32:53.785
- Mr. Lee.
- Yes?

00:32:55.161 --> 00:32:55.995
Maybe one drink?

00:32:56.579 --> 00:32:57.914
Seriously?

00:32:58.915 --> 00:33:00.416
Just one.

00:33:12.053 --> 00:33:13.387
Big Al.

00:33:13.471 --> 00:33:14.931
- Let's go.
- Yeah, let's go.

00:33:31.989 --> 00:33:34.784
Director Yun,
you really need to stop calling me.

00:33:34.867 --> 00:33:36.077
Listen.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.621
I called for a reason.

00:33:39.247 --> 00:33:41.624
I heard Hanmin issued short-term bonds.

00:33:42.458 --> 00:33:46.087
A private equity firm in Hong Kong
called DK Ventures bought in bulk,

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:47.880
and other firms bought some as well.

00:33:48.589 --> 00:33:51.384
But you know, DK Ventures

00:33:51.467 --> 00:33:53.553
is where Shin Jung-woo used to work.

00:33:59.559 --> 00:34:01.435
I'll call you back later.

00:34:18.494 --> 00:34:20.788
Are you here as a company representative?

00:34:20.872 --> 00:34:21.706
No.

00:34:23.207 --> 00:34:24.542
Then what are you doing here?

00:34:26.419 --> 00:34:28.004
I told you, Ms. Song is looking into you.

00:34:29.005 --> 00:34:30.631
I gave you several chances already.

00:34:31.215 --> 00:34:33.050
Are you just refusing
to return empty-handed?

00:34:35.344 --> 00:34:37.180
How are you so sure that I'm empty-handed?

00:34:38.306 --> 00:34:39.473
You don't have it.

00:34:40.266 --> 00:34:41.642
Back then and even now,

00:34:41.726 --> 00:34:43.436
you don't have what it takes
to face Chairman Kang.

00:34:52.737 --> 00:34:54.906
That's for the hospital bills.
Tell me if you need more.

00:34:55.615 --> 00:34:57.158
Don't waste your time…

00:34:58.701 --> 00:34:59.952
on misplaced sympathy.

00:35:16.719 --> 00:35:18.721
I just came for a short hospital visit.

00:35:22.225 --> 00:35:23.684
Don't get any wild ideas.

00:35:23.768 --> 00:35:26.604
I only turned a blind eye
so she'd submit the untampered financials.

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:29.732
It got Chairman Kang off our back,

00:35:29.815 --> 00:35:31.400
so she should at least be compensated.

00:35:36.739 --> 00:35:37.907
I don't have what it takes?

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.702
Then did you use me
because you had what it took?

00:35:42.411 --> 00:35:44.789
By throwing me on the task force
and playing dumb about the files?

00:35:46.123 --> 00:35:47.416
You were after the same result.

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:48.834
And what did I want exactly?

00:35:50.419 --> 00:35:52.713
The girl in there
is someone I used to live with.

00:35:53.422 --> 00:35:57.009
What do you know about the guilt
of thinking that I'm the one to blame?

00:35:58.636 --> 00:36:00.137
It wasn't your responsibility.

00:36:00.721 --> 00:36:02.640
How have you not changed at all
in nine years?

00:36:04.558 --> 00:36:05.977
Why shoulder the burden of something

00:36:06.894 --> 00:36:08.187
that's not your responsibility?

00:36:10.398 --> 00:36:12.483
Because I don't want
to be pathetic like you.

00:36:14.485 --> 00:36:16.279
Back then and even now…

00:36:18.322 --> 00:36:19.490
you're just a coward.

00:36:51.355 --> 00:36:53.107
Auntie, that hurts.

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:54.191
Does it?

00:36:57.737 --> 00:37:00.114
Filling in for your mom is no easy feat.

00:37:02.658 --> 00:37:03.743
Sorry.

00:37:03.826 --> 00:37:05.578
Of course, it isn't.

00:37:05.661 --> 00:37:08.539
My mom, Kim Mi-sook, is special.

00:37:10.333 --> 00:37:11.375
You're right.

00:37:11.459 --> 00:37:13.753
She is special, so she'll wake up soon.

00:37:13.836 --> 00:37:15.546
Just like Snow White?

00:37:16.672 --> 00:37:17.673
What?

00:37:17.757 --> 00:37:20.801
Like Snow White and like Sleeping Beauty.

00:37:22.261 --> 00:37:23.387
Mi-sook will wake up.

00:37:23.971 --> 00:37:27.266
The life of a princess
is a lonely and exhausting one.

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:28.809
But you have to endure it.

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:31.812
Bom, go to the small room
and read your fairy tale book.

00:37:31.896 --> 00:37:33.105
The aunties need to chat.

00:37:33.689 --> 00:37:34.857
Okay.

00:37:40.946 --> 00:37:42.239
Hong Keum-bo,

00:37:42.323 --> 00:37:44.784
you may be intelligent,
but you lack improvisational skills.

00:37:46.035 --> 00:37:47.661
Have you thought about my proposal?

00:37:48.621 --> 00:37:49.914
Let's clear a few things first.

00:37:51.165 --> 00:37:52.041
One,

00:37:52.625 --> 00:37:54.001
which slush fund will we steal first?

00:37:55.169 --> 00:37:57.421
The one hidden under the names
of the OW award winners.

00:37:59.215 --> 00:38:00.091
Don't tell me

00:38:00.174 --> 00:38:02.051
you knew about it from the start.

00:38:02.134 --> 00:38:03.844
Was that why you asked for a nomination?

00:38:04.595 --> 00:38:05.721
Of course.

00:38:08.224 --> 00:38:11.143
Do you remember
that obituary on the intranet system?

00:38:11.227 --> 00:38:12.812
Of Kim I-gyeong, the OW award winner?

00:38:14.271 --> 00:38:15.189
She died.

00:38:16.357 --> 00:38:18.317
That puts both you
and your sister in danger.

00:38:19.318 --> 00:38:20.403
Now my second question.

00:38:20.486 --> 00:38:22.530
What will you do
with the real Hong Jang-mi

00:38:22.613 --> 00:38:23.864
during this operation?

00:38:24.824 --> 00:38:26.075
Don't worry.

00:38:26.158 --> 00:38:29.203
The real Hong Jang-mi
is in a very safe place.

00:38:33.332 --> 00:38:36.335
PERFECT FOR COLLEGE ADMISSION SUCCESS!
SANGOL BOARDING CRAM SCHOOL!

00:38:46.303 --> 00:38:47.555
How is this even possible?

00:38:53.769 --> 00:38:54.770
HONG JANG-MI

00:39:21.088 --> 00:39:23.382
Lie low at the boarding cram school
for three months.

00:39:24.091 --> 00:39:26.886
No outings are allowed, day or overnight.

00:39:40.733 --> 00:39:42.234
Even so, you can't do this.

00:39:43.611 --> 00:39:45.821
Why is everyone telling me
that I can't and shouldn't?

00:39:45.905 --> 00:39:46.906
Because it's dangerous.

00:39:47.948 --> 00:39:50.367
The fear that President Kang's death
might be on me

00:39:50.451 --> 00:39:51.619
keeps me up at night.

00:39:52.369 --> 00:39:55.414
Do you know how I ended up at Hanmin
after wandering the country?

00:39:55.498 --> 00:39:57.249
Song Ju-ran summoned me.

00:39:57.333 --> 00:40:00.336
She hired me on the condition
that I spy on President Kang.

00:40:01.128 --> 00:40:01.962
And now,

00:40:02.046 --> 00:40:03.714
she wants me to bug President Shin.

00:40:12.681 --> 00:40:14.600
I knew Chairman Kang would say that.

00:40:14.683 --> 00:40:16.852
He's stingy with his own,

00:40:16.936 --> 00:40:19.313
but happy to rack up debt
with other people's money.

00:40:20.856 --> 00:40:23.984
He'll issue short-term bonds
with a one-year maturity,

00:40:24.068 --> 00:40:26.654
then ask to extend the repayment period
by another year or two.

00:40:27.238 --> 00:40:30.282
In the meantime,
we'll quietly accumulate more bonds.

00:40:30.866 --> 00:40:32.868
And if Hanmin goes bankrupt on its own?
That's a win for us.

00:40:36.997 --> 00:40:38.082
What does that mean?

00:40:38.165 --> 00:40:39.375
You understood, right?

00:40:40.292 --> 00:40:43.295
When a company goes bankrupt,
the bondholders become its owner.

00:40:43.379 --> 00:40:47.174
That's why Shin Jung-woo and DK Ventures
are buying up Hanmin bonds.

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:51.845
They're betting on Hanmin's demise,
based on inside information.

00:40:52.846 --> 00:40:54.682
They intend to snap up
the company for cheap.

00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:57.726
You can't trust any of them.

00:40:58.686 --> 00:41:01.355
Forget the ledger,
this is completely out of our league.

00:41:02.064 --> 00:41:05.359
I'm going to the hospital tonight
to say goodbye to Mi-sook.

00:41:05.943 --> 00:41:07.653
I'm officially rejecting your proposal.

00:41:16.787 --> 00:41:17.621
Gosh.

00:41:17.705 --> 00:41:19.498
You're home, as expected.

00:41:20.165 --> 00:41:22.209
Eun-joo, who used to live here,
called me today.

00:41:23.711 --> 00:41:24.878
Eun-joo did?

00:41:25.796 --> 00:41:27.756
Is that Auntie Eun-joo?

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:28.716
No.

00:41:52.448 --> 00:41:53.699
I do think

00:41:54.617 --> 00:41:56.619
what happened to Mi-sook is a tragedy,

00:41:56.702 --> 00:41:58.954
but we are a dormitory
supported by the city

00:41:59.455 --> 00:42:01.957
that helps unmarried women
achieve independence.

00:42:02.875 --> 00:42:04.918
As such, all rules must be followed.

00:42:05.836 --> 00:42:09.048
Outsiders are strictly forbidden
in this dormitory.

00:42:10.507 --> 00:42:12.301
Even if it's…

00:42:14.386 --> 00:42:15.429
a resident's child.

00:42:18.682 --> 00:42:19.516
Sorry.

00:42:20.809 --> 00:42:23.228
You two must figure out
what will be best for her.

00:42:23.312 --> 00:42:25.189
After all, neither of you is her guardian.

00:42:31.987 --> 00:42:34.365
I'll go back to the children's home.

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:37.910
So please don't get mad at the aunties.

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:53.092
I have a child here…

00:42:53.175 --> 00:42:56.428
We're unable to take in
any more children right now.

00:42:56.929 --> 00:42:58.806
I see.

00:42:58.889 --> 00:43:01.642
All facilities have been full
since the IMF crisis began.

00:43:01.725 --> 00:43:02.976
I see.

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:04.645
I'm sorry.

00:43:12.903 --> 00:43:15.322
I was wondering
if you could take in a child.

00:43:17.491 --> 00:43:19.660
Thank you. I'll call you back in a bit.

00:43:21.954 --> 00:43:23.664
I found a spot.

00:43:24.248 --> 00:43:25.541
We can drop Bom off tomorrow.

00:43:26.458 --> 00:43:28.001
The RA is right.

00:43:28.085 --> 00:43:29.586
We can't be responsible for her.

00:43:31.088 --> 00:43:32.756
Don't say that when she can hear you.

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:36.051
How would you pull off a massive task
when you can't even take care of a child?

00:43:42.516 --> 00:43:43.559
I knew from the start

00:43:44.643 --> 00:43:46.770
that the New Korea Fund had issues.

00:43:47.938 --> 00:43:50.149
But I couldn't stop Mi-sook.

00:43:50.983 --> 00:43:52.025
No, I didn't stop her.

00:43:52.818 --> 00:43:54.570
Because my work was more important.

00:43:57.322 --> 00:43:58.991
The fact that I was one of those people

00:43:59.992 --> 00:44:02.286
who refused to take responsibility
makes me so mad.

00:44:04.747 --> 00:44:05.706
I can't do it.

00:44:18.177 --> 00:44:19.720
I'll be your guardian from now on,

00:44:20.304 --> 00:44:21.889
just until your mom gets better.

00:44:22.931 --> 00:44:25.309
We can't live here together,

00:44:25.809 --> 00:44:27.561
but I think we can try something else.

00:44:52.669 --> 00:44:53.837
Eat up.

00:44:55.339 --> 00:44:56.924
Now that everyone is here,

00:44:57.966 --> 00:44:58.800
cheers!

00:44:58.884 --> 00:45:00.260
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:45:01.803 --> 00:45:03.764
- Have a good dinner.
- Thank you.

00:45:07.726 --> 00:45:09.019
Did our President Shin

00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:11.480
date a lot of women in Hong Kong?

00:45:12.981 --> 00:45:14.775
All he ever did was work,
so I worried about him.

00:45:16.527 --> 00:45:19.988
He would never reveal
his ally's weaknesses.

00:45:20.072 --> 00:45:20.906
It's the truth.

00:45:22.282 --> 00:45:23.742
His last relationship was nine years ago.

00:45:23.825 --> 00:45:25.911
I think he said
they were college sweethearts.

00:45:26.578 --> 00:45:27.412
Really?

00:45:29.081 --> 00:45:29.957
How classic.

00:45:31.375 --> 00:45:34.545
Yes, he's one tidy person.

00:45:45.222 --> 00:45:47.224
Wait, was that your sandglass?

00:45:48.725 --> 00:45:49.935
Well,

00:45:50.018 --> 00:45:51.436
that was a long time ago.

00:45:52.396 --> 00:45:53.564
If it was nine years ago,

00:45:53.647 --> 00:45:55.232
she must have a kid or two by now.

00:45:55.732 --> 00:45:56.692
Yeah, probably.

00:45:58.569 --> 00:45:59.403
Now,

00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:02.573
I also have exciting news
about President Shin and Nora.

00:46:03.782 --> 00:46:04.992
On January 16th,

00:46:05.576 --> 00:46:06.702
the two are getting engaged.

00:46:09.121 --> 00:46:10.706
Surprise, you two.

00:46:10.789 --> 00:46:12.624
The chairman gave his blessing.

00:46:13.333 --> 00:46:14.960
Congratulations.

00:46:15.043 --> 00:46:16.587
Cheers. You'll be there, right?

00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:18.463
Congratulations, you two.

00:46:20.882 --> 00:46:22.009
Congrats, Auntie.

00:46:23.594 --> 00:46:25.887
I guess you'll really be our family soon.

00:46:30.726 --> 00:46:31.893
Congratulations, Ms. Kang.

00:46:38.692 --> 00:46:41.194
{\an8}CLOSED DUE TO A FAMILY EMERGENCY

00:46:59.671 --> 00:47:00.589
You know,

00:47:01.757 --> 00:47:05.677
our Keum-bo is pretty overall,
but her eyes especially sparkle like gems

00:47:05.761 --> 00:47:08.055
because she gets them from me.

00:47:08.138 --> 00:47:09.890
If you look closely,

00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:12.601
this kid has got gems in her eyes too.

00:47:12.684 --> 00:47:16.355
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:21.068
- Could it be…
- Your imagination is running wild.

00:47:21.151 --> 00:47:22.027
You're wrong.

00:47:23.528 --> 00:47:24.821
Sweetie,

00:47:24.905 --> 00:47:28.950
can you tell me the name of the woman
who gave birth to you and raised you?

00:47:29.534 --> 00:47:31.870
It's Ms. Kim Mi-sook.

00:47:32.454 --> 00:47:33.455
Mi-sook…

00:47:34.373 --> 00:47:36.583
She's my colleague's daughter.

00:47:36.667 --> 00:47:38.835
I brought her here
because she has nowhere to go.

00:47:39.378 --> 00:47:41.421
Her mom's in the hospital,

00:47:42.339 --> 00:47:43.298
and she's still unconscious.

00:47:43.882 --> 00:47:46.343
- My goodness.
- The children's homes are full too.

00:47:46.426 --> 00:47:47.886
There are no empty spots.

00:47:47.969 --> 00:47:48.970
Oh dear.

00:47:49.971 --> 00:47:52.808
I guess the IMF crisis
has more parents dropping off their kids.

00:47:53.684 --> 00:47:56.561
I know you're busy with the restaurant,
so I'm sorry to ask you this.

00:47:56.645 --> 00:47:59.731
Don't be sorry. We're not busy.

00:47:59.815 --> 00:48:01.441
Don't worry about the kid either.

00:48:01.525 --> 00:48:03.694
Of course you should leave her with us.

00:48:03.777 --> 00:48:05.904
We raised two wild,
unruly sisters ourselves.

00:48:07.322 --> 00:48:08.657
By the way,

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:11.243
how'd it go with that young man last time?

00:48:12.536 --> 00:48:13.954
You know,

00:48:14.037 --> 00:48:16.498
the handsome man
you told us to zip our lips about.

00:48:17.082 --> 00:48:18.166
He died.

00:48:22.003 --> 00:48:23.004
Bom, have some more.

00:48:23.588 --> 00:48:25.257
Yeah, eat up.

00:48:26.258 --> 00:48:27.175
Have this too.

00:48:27.259 --> 00:48:29.010
Thank you.

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:32.723
Thanks.

00:48:32.806 --> 00:48:34.141
Goodness me.

00:48:34.808 --> 00:48:36.059
All thanks to Mi-sook's child,

00:48:36.143 --> 00:48:39.062
we get to hear our daughter
apologize and thank us.

00:48:41.815 --> 00:48:42.691
What's your name?

00:48:42.774 --> 00:48:43.942
It's Bom.

00:48:44.025 --> 00:48:46.278
- Gosh. Bom.
- Hello, Bom.

00:48:48.363 --> 00:48:50.031
- Is it good?
- Yes.

00:48:50.741 --> 00:48:51.575
Eat up.

00:48:57.456 --> 00:49:01.710
ULLALA CHICKEN

00:49:08.717 --> 00:49:11.261
Why did you follow us
if you weren't going to come in?

00:49:12.179 --> 00:49:13.805
I needed time to think.

00:49:14.931 --> 00:49:15.766
It's cold.

00:49:17.184 --> 00:49:18.226
I told you to come inside.

00:49:18.310 --> 00:49:22.147
How can I, when your parents think
I'm Hong Jang-mi's senior alum?

00:49:23.774 --> 00:49:25.025
Let's part ways here.

00:49:25.776 --> 00:49:26.610
Have a nice life.

00:49:28.278 --> 00:49:30.280
Thank you for everything, Go Bok-hee.

00:49:32.324 --> 00:49:35.494
After being called Ms. Go
and Queen Bee all this time,

00:49:36.077 --> 00:49:37.329
I'm Go Bok-hee in the end.

00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:10.904
Damn it.

00:50:11.446 --> 00:50:12.322
Come on.

00:50:25.836 --> 00:50:28.547
I'm not a kid.
What am I supposed to do with this?

00:50:35.428 --> 00:50:36.638
Hong Jang-mi.

00:50:36.721 --> 00:50:40.308
As of today, you're officially recognized
as a resident of Room 301.

00:50:40.392 --> 00:50:42.102
"We're college students."

00:50:47.399 --> 00:50:48.650
Bok-hee, wait.

00:50:49.484 --> 00:50:52.070
This is pepper spray for self-defense,

00:50:52.153 --> 00:50:53.738
and this is your lunch.

00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:57.492
Bok-hee, I'm always praying for you.

00:50:58.368 --> 00:51:00.829
My mommy prays every day.

00:51:34.529 --> 00:51:35.363
Why didn't you stop me?

00:51:36.948 --> 00:51:39.743
You'd never be able to
steal that money by yourself.

00:51:41.202 --> 00:51:42.037
Are you interested?

00:51:48.752 --> 00:51:49.794
Walk me through the plan.

00:51:50.795 --> 00:51:52.797
Steal 300 billion won and then what?

00:51:54.090 --> 00:51:57.010
Shin Jung-woo is betting
on Hanmin going belly up.

00:51:57.093 --> 00:51:58.261
Are you doing the same?

00:52:02.057 --> 00:52:03.892
I'm going to save Hanmin.

00:52:09.856 --> 00:52:12.651
If you look at
Hanmin's ownership structure,

00:52:12.734 --> 00:52:14.527
Oh Deok-gyu has 9%

00:52:14.611 --> 00:52:16.488
and Choi In-ja has 1%.

00:52:16.571 --> 00:52:20.033
Oh Deok-gyu inherited his shares
after his wife passed away,

00:52:20.116 --> 00:52:23.370
while Choi In-ja got hers from Kang
as a part of her divorce settlement.

00:52:25.538 --> 00:52:27.540
Kang Nora, his only daughter, has 5%

00:52:27.624 --> 00:52:29.501
and so does his grandson Albert.

00:52:30.251 --> 00:52:34.422
{\an8}After Kang Myeong-hwi died,
his 9% went to his father,

00:52:34.506 --> 00:52:37.050
which leaves Kang Pil-beom with 48.6%.

00:52:37.801 --> 00:52:40.637
So if all the shares
in his family are combined,

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:42.138
they have 68.6%.

00:52:42.639 --> 00:52:45.517
Hanmin is basically
a family-owned business.

00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.018
In other words,

00:52:47.102 --> 00:52:49.562
Hanmin is Kang Pil-beom's kingdom.

00:52:50.772 --> 00:52:52.607
You've been a goody-two-shoes
your whole life,

00:52:52.691 --> 00:52:55.318
so how would you steal
that massive amount of money?

00:52:55.819 --> 00:52:56.653
Teach me.

00:52:56.736 --> 00:52:58.446
I'm a fast learner.

00:52:59.572 --> 00:53:01.074
Unlike Shin Jung-woo,

00:53:01.157 --> 00:53:03.827
we'll steal the slush fund
and buy Hanmin's stocks.

00:53:05.787 --> 00:53:07.914
That'll take away
Kang Pil-beom's management rights,

00:53:07.998 --> 00:53:10.792
and blow up Shin Jung-woo
and DK Ventures's theft.

00:53:12.419 --> 00:53:16.297
Then we'll be able to protect
both Hanmin and its employees.

00:53:20.552 --> 00:53:24.305
I'm not interested in destroying them
or in saving the company.

00:53:25.181 --> 00:53:27.851
Set some aside for Mi-sook's
hospital bills and compensation,

00:53:27.934 --> 00:53:29.686
and give me a little hazard pay.

00:53:30.729 --> 00:53:31.855
If you can promise me that,

00:53:31.938 --> 00:53:33.857
I'm in with Hong Keum-bo.

00:53:35.567 --> 00:53:37.152
How much is a little hazard pay…

00:53:38.403 --> 00:53:39.487
exactly?

00:53:40.447 --> 00:53:41.656
Maybe 10%?

00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:42.574
Ten?

00:53:43.742 --> 00:53:45.493
Have you no shame?

00:53:46.619 --> 00:53:47.495
Hold on.

00:53:48.038 --> 00:53:49.539
She'll be stealing the slush fund

00:53:50.123 --> 00:53:52.292
and also monitoring Shin Jung-woo…

00:53:53.126 --> 00:53:53.960
That's right.

00:53:54.669 --> 00:53:56.755
You'll be needing Go Bok-hee
for several reasons.

00:53:58.798 --> 00:54:00.341
Based on how you do,

00:54:00.425 --> 00:54:03.178
I can give you a discount
and only ask for a one-way ticket to LA.

00:54:04.429 --> 00:54:07.891
I'll show you
what "the utmost best" looks like.

00:54:07.974 --> 00:54:09.642
You just wait and see.

00:54:14.856 --> 00:54:16.232
Let's see what the veteran can do.

00:54:28.578 --> 00:54:30.121
You have to request time off first.

00:54:30.205 --> 00:54:33.083
Cha is hell-bent on revenge
after that fiasco, right?

00:54:33.583 --> 00:54:34.793
I'll have to coax him.

00:54:35.585 --> 00:54:37.545
Maybe we should've asked
for help from Nora?

00:54:37.629 --> 00:54:38.797
He'd listen to a director.

00:54:39.756 --> 00:54:41.341
Why are you so submissive to authority?

00:54:43.384 --> 00:54:44.511
Everyone's like that.

00:54:44.594 --> 00:54:45.553
Everything about you,

00:54:45.637 --> 00:54:47.806
from the unyielding integrity
to the petty pride,

00:54:47.889 --> 00:54:49.390
needs to go now.

00:54:49.474 --> 00:54:52.352
It's hard to earn money,
but it's even harder to steal it.

00:54:52.435 --> 00:54:54.646
Especially in this tough economy.

00:55:07.367 --> 00:55:09.369
Amid challenges in corporate management,

00:55:09.452 --> 00:55:12.205
the burdens on ordinary citizens
are steadily increasing.

00:55:12.288 --> 00:55:14.582
Soaring inflation
that shows no sign of slowing

00:55:14.666 --> 00:55:16.376
and the threat of widespread unemployment

00:55:16.459 --> 00:55:19.462
are raising fears
of an unprecedentedly cold winter ahead.

00:55:22.590 --> 00:55:24.300
This place has really thinned out.

00:55:24.843 --> 00:55:27.846
Well, a 40% reduction
is basically half the workforce.

00:55:30.098 --> 00:55:32.642
By the way,
can we really trust DK Ventures?

00:55:33.476 --> 00:55:35.311
- Why do you ask?
- They're treating this place

00:55:35.395 --> 00:55:36.354
like occupied territory.

00:55:36.938 --> 00:55:39.232
They summon the division managers
and grill them.

00:55:39.816 --> 00:55:41.818
There's talk of a second restructuring,

00:55:41.901 --> 00:55:43.611
and the air in the office is tense.

00:55:44.571 --> 00:55:45.488
Big Al.

00:55:46.072 --> 00:55:46.948
Have you heard anything?

00:55:47.824 --> 00:55:49.033
Nothing.

00:55:49.826 --> 00:55:51.703
I'm sure President Shin
knows what he's doing.

00:55:55.331 --> 00:55:57.208
I hear President Shin was the facilitator

00:55:57.292 --> 00:56:01.254
who acted as a bridge
between DK Ventures and Hanmin.

00:56:02.463 --> 00:56:04.841
That's why his reputation
has been tanking.

00:56:04.924 --> 00:56:06.050
Tell us.

00:56:17.687 --> 00:56:20.064
I might not look it,
but I respect kinship.

00:56:20.565 --> 00:56:23.151
I don't feel comfortable
badmouthing my uncle-to-be.

00:56:23.234 --> 00:56:24.110
- Uncle?
- Uncle?

00:56:31.993 --> 00:56:32.827
Hey.

00:56:32.911 --> 00:56:35.496
- Ms. Hong, this too.
- Sure.

00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:38.041
- Ms. Hong, I need four copies of this.
- Sure.

00:56:38.124 --> 00:56:39.459
It's all missing.

00:56:41.461 --> 00:56:42.295
Seriously?

00:56:50.929 --> 00:56:53.431
What's this? I never asked for coffee.

00:56:54.182 --> 00:56:55.975
I'd like to take tomorrow off.

00:56:56.601 --> 00:56:58.186
I'd also like tomorrow off.

00:57:02.023 --> 00:57:04.651
But you see, we can't just do
what we want to do

00:57:04.734 --> 00:57:05.860
all the time.

00:57:05.944 --> 00:57:08.071
Say goodbye to your day off.

00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:11.991
Hold on, Ms. Hong.

00:57:12.075 --> 00:57:13.117
Let me ask you something.

00:57:14.577 --> 00:57:17.664
Were you close to Director Kang Nora?

00:57:17.747 --> 00:57:20.875
I've acquired intel
that you two used to eat burgers together.

00:57:22.919 --> 00:57:25.547
Why don't you compile an extensive list

00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:27.507
of what Director Kang likes?

00:57:33.429 --> 00:57:34.264
Goodbye now.

00:57:38.893 --> 00:57:41.813
{\an8}DIRECTOR KANG NORA'S FAVORITE FOOD
AND PREFERENCES

00:57:42.605 --> 00:57:45.233
Will that be enough
for Cha to grant you time off?

00:57:47.110 --> 00:57:50.196
You could also go
and make that withdrawal yourself.

00:57:52.115 --> 00:57:55.076
Why do I feel like
you're pushing me into danger?

00:57:55.785 --> 00:57:57.579
The money in Hong Jang-mi's account

00:57:57.662 --> 00:58:00.206
should be withdrawn by the account holder
to avoid suspicion.

00:58:00.790 --> 00:58:03.167
Context also matters
in fraud and embezzlement.

00:58:04.502 --> 00:58:08.339
Also, I'll be on standby on the 12th floor
in case of an emergency.

00:58:08.423 --> 00:58:09.591
There's one person

00:58:10.174 --> 00:58:11.384
who could help us with this…

00:58:12.885 --> 00:58:14.846
Damn it. I don't want to.

00:58:14.929 --> 00:58:16.848
I told you to lose that petty pride.

00:58:17.432 --> 00:58:18.391
If you can't do it,

00:58:18.474 --> 00:58:21.060
let's make a deal and not a request.

00:58:21.686 --> 00:58:24.397
Ms. Song might get
a confirmation call from the bank,

00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:27.150
so I'll have Madam Choi
keep her busy with her nagging.

00:58:28.610 --> 00:58:29.902
But to make that happen…

00:58:29.986 --> 00:58:30.862
{\an8}KANG NORA

00:58:30.945 --> 00:58:32.155
…we need her.

00:58:39.370 --> 00:58:40.496
What's taking her so long?

00:58:42.123 --> 00:58:43.708
I hear footsteps.

00:59:00.933 --> 00:59:03.227
Why did you take the stairs
and not the elevator?

00:59:04.354 --> 00:59:07.523
I figured I'd need
to avoid attracting attention

00:59:07.607 --> 00:59:09.567
and maintain secrecy.

00:59:10.401 --> 00:59:11.694
She's not completely clueless.

00:59:21.621 --> 00:59:24.165
I'm just trying to meet your eye level,

00:59:24.248 --> 00:59:25.333
big sisters.

00:59:28.586 --> 00:59:29.671
You want to see Bom, right?

00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:31.714
Yes.

00:59:32.256 --> 00:59:33.383
If you fill me in for a day,

00:59:33.466 --> 00:59:34.884
I'll tell you where Bom is.

00:59:35.468 --> 00:59:36.469
I can totally do that.

00:59:37.553 --> 00:59:38.554
But…

00:59:38.638 --> 00:59:39.889
what am I filling?

00:59:46.729 --> 00:59:49.774
{\an8}OPERATION DAY

01:00:02.578 --> 01:00:03.579
Ms. Hong?

01:00:04.163 --> 01:00:04.997
Do you have a cold?

01:00:21.389 --> 01:00:22.473
Ms. Hong.

01:00:31.441 --> 01:00:32.483
HONG JANG-MI

01:00:45.121 --> 01:00:46.164
Auntie?

01:00:55.006 --> 01:00:56.090
What are you…

01:01:01.345 --> 01:01:02.764
That was so rude of you.

01:01:02.847 --> 01:01:05.224
How could you strip me like that?

01:01:05.725 --> 01:01:06.601
Strip you?

01:01:07.310 --> 01:01:08.770
- No…
- Auntie.

01:01:08.853 --> 01:01:10.813
That could lead to a misunderstanding.

01:01:10.897 --> 01:01:13.608
Your mask was taken off, not stripped.

01:01:14.484 --> 01:01:15.401
It was about her mask.

01:01:15.485 --> 01:01:16.861
I see.

01:01:20.865 --> 01:01:22.742
I will apologize for that.

01:01:23.326 --> 01:01:24.202
I'm sorry.

01:01:24.702 --> 01:01:26.788
But you'll also need to explain yourself.

01:01:27.789 --> 01:01:30.708
Why were you delivering lunches
with someone else's name tag?

01:01:33.419 --> 01:01:36.172
Are you exercising
your right to remain silent?

01:01:37.590 --> 01:01:38.841
Ms. Go.

01:01:38.925 --> 01:01:40.259
Where's Ms. Hong Jang-mi?

01:01:41.969 --> 01:01:45.306
I believe I've mentioned
this several times before,

01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:47.266
but we're not friends.

01:01:49.936 --> 01:01:51.854
Where else would Ms. Hong be?

01:01:51.938 --> 01:01:53.856
I'm sure she's at the hospital
where her roommate is.

01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:56.859
She probably couldn't take time off,
so Auntie Nora covered for her.

01:01:56.943 --> 01:01:58.653
- Right?
- Right.

01:01:59.237 --> 01:02:00.071
He's right.

01:02:03.241 --> 01:02:05.618
I have to show up at the IT Division
by three o'clock.

01:02:06.118 --> 01:02:07.662
Take care now.

01:02:22.885 --> 01:02:23.886
I should get going too.

01:02:30.393 --> 01:02:31.519
Is it just me…

01:02:33.354 --> 01:02:35.940
or do you seem
particularly interested in Hong Jang-mi?

01:02:38.234 --> 01:02:39.569
I can assure you this.

01:02:41.112 --> 01:02:44.115
I am most certainly
not interested in Hong Jang-mi.

01:02:51.706 --> 01:02:53.207
You got caught by him, of all people?

01:02:53.291 --> 01:02:54.709
And your mom? Did you ask her to come?

01:02:54.792 --> 01:02:56.460
She should be here soon.

01:02:59.005 --> 01:03:00.006
Don't worry about me.

01:03:12.184 --> 01:03:14.061
By the way, where did Ms. Hong go?

01:03:19.108 --> 01:03:22.320
{\an8}You have to withdraw funds
from a total of three different banks.

01:03:22.403 --> 01:03:25.990
Breaking the large check into smaller ones
makes it harder to trace.

01:03:26.073 --> 01:03:27.658
Typically, at lunchtime,

01:03:27.742 --> 01:03:30.870
there are fewer tellers working
but more customers.

01:03:30.953 --> 01:03:32.747
So they process
deposits and withdrawals quickly

01:03:32.830 --> 01:03:34.206
to avoid holding up the line.

01:03:34.290 --> 01:03:36.834
That's the time you want to target.

01:03:39.003 --> 01:03:40.296
CHUNGSEO BANK

01:03:42.298 --> 01:03:45.176
Everyone is saying
you're about to close down for good!

01:03:45.259 --> 01:03:48.804
Help me withdraw the funds
from my five-year savings account first!

01:03:48.888 --> 01:03:50.514
Hurry up!

01:03:57.855 --> 01:04:02.151
My life and my friends' lives
are at stake here!

01:04:13.871 --> 01:04:15.915
3 BILLION WON TRANSFERRED

01:04:15.998 --> 01:04:18.459
{\an8}TRANSFER OF 3 BILLION WON!

01:04:18.542 --> 01:04:21.671
FARMERS' BANK

01:04:24.882 --> 01:04:26.425
FARMERS' BANK
CHECKING ACCOUNT

01:04:26.509 --> 01:04:28.052
There's one left now.

01:04:29.053 --> 01:04:30.596
The one with the largest balance.

01:04:43.192 --> 01:04:44.944
I have to do it today.

01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:49.490
I mean, do you think this makes any sense?

01:04:50.074 --> 01:04:52.743
My Nora is the only one
without an assistant of her own.

01:04:52.827 --> 01:04:54.996
She's not some lightweight executive.

01:04:55.746 --> 01:04:58.332
Just imagine how excluded she must feel!

01:05:00.626 --> 01:05:01.794
This is ridiculous!

01:05:02.670 --> 01:05:05.214
Ms. Song might get
a confirmation call from the bank.

01:05:05.297 --> 01:05:08.592
I'll be on standby on the 12th floor
in case of an emergency.

01:05:09.802 --> 01:05:12.263
Now serving customer number 217.

01:05:12.346 --> 01:05:13.264
That's me!

01:05:22.648 --> 01:05:23.899
S.J.R. CONFIRMATION REQUIRED

01:05:26.902 --> 01:05:28.029
What's wrong?

01:05:28.529 --> 01:05:30.948
It says I need to confirm with an "SJR."

01:05:31.782 --> 01:05:32.783
Oh, that.

01:05:34.368 --> 01:05:37.830
They sometimes use dual authorization
to hide the dirty money even deeper,

01:05:37.913 --> 01:05:40.583
so take Song Ju-ran's
authorization letter, just in case.

01:05:41.917 --> 01:05:43.210
"SJR."

01:05:43.294 --> 01:05:44.920
It stands for Song Ju-ran, my boss.

01:05:46.422 --> 01:05:49.341
That's why she gave me this.

01:05:49.425 --> 01:05:50.718
It's an authorization letter.

01:05:57.725 --> 01:05:59.101
AUTHORIZATION LETTER

01:05:59.685 --> 01:06:01.395
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD
HONG JANG-MI

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:08.069
I am indeed Hong Jang-mi.

01:06:08.694 --> 01:06:11.030
Yes, we've confirmed your name and face,

01:06:11.113 --> 01:06:14.408
but we should be extra careful
with such a large sum of money.

01:06:15.951 --> 01:06:16.827
Just a moment.

01:06:33.969 --> 01:06:34.929
Madam Choi.

01:06:38.182 --> 01:06:39.725
Let's talk in my office.

01:07:14.176 --> 01:07:18.139
{\an8}SPECIAL THANKS TO SHIN YU-NA
FOR HER APPEARANCE

01:07:49.211 --> 01:07:51.046
{\an8}UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:54.008
{\an8}I think that "Captain" knows something.

01:07:54.091 --> 01:07:54.967
{\an8}Who could it be?

01:07:55.050 --> 01:07:56.635
{\an8}We must find them
and get them on our side.

01:07:56.719 --> 01:07:58.012
{\an8}You suspect someone, don't you?

01:07:58.596 --> 01:08:00.639
{\an8}- If it wasn't an insider…
- Yes?

01:08:00.723 --> 01:08:02.224
{\an8}An outsider must have done it?

01:08:02.308 --> 01:08:05.477
{\an8}He needs to get beaten up out there
for him to accept our hand.

01:08:05.561 --> 01:08:06.896
{\an8}And you know what happens next.

01:08:06.979 --> 01:08:08.230
{\an8}Why can't I log in?

01:08:08.856 --> 01:08:10.983
{\an8}Maybe you got banned
for writing something inappropriate?

01:08:12.109 --> 01:08:13.527
{\an8}Hong Keum-bo.

01:08:13.611 --> 01:08:14.945
{\an8}Any updates on Ms. Song?

01:08:15.029 --> 01:08:17.323
{\an8}She'll be on your tail
once she realizes the funds are gone.

01:08:17.406 --> 01:08:19.533
{\an8}Inspector of the Capital Market
Investigation Division at the FSS,

01:08:19.617 --> 01:08:20.659
{\an8}Inspector Hong Keum-bo.

01:08:23.412 --> 01:08:28.417
