00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.630
did you realize?

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.160
The villagers are all gone.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:10.120
It's empty now.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.120
Right?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Where did they go?

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.680
They are over there.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.430
Why do they

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.000
look so pale?

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.480
What are you doing there?

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:33.600
Run!

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.240
Run, Hua Xiaohua! Run!

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:38.670
Hua Xiaohua!

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.870
Run!

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.790
Why aren't they chasing after me?

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:51.670
Don't make any noise.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.390
Save Weigui.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:57.510
I'll lure them away.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.200
Help!

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:02.440
Help!

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:16.670
How come

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.600
it turns dark so soon?

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.480
You see,

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.030
this village

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:24.550
is surrounded by mountains.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.750
Days and nights are irregular here.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.270
We're used to it.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.480
Is the bird related to the irregular

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:33.840
days and nights here?

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.150
Just stay here

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.360
and have some medicinal tea.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.550
He is limping on his other leg now.

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:02.600
Thank you.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:35.840
The tea is...

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:40.600
Quit struggling.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:41.790
I added

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.390
weakening powder in the tea.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.150
It makes my life easier.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:47.150
Who are you?

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.030
What do you want?

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.630
Who I am doesn't matter.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.670
What you

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:53.270
and your friend have

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.440
matter a lot.

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:02.480
My friends

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:03.440
will return soon.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:04.870
You should be afraid.

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:09.670
They can't even save themselves,

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.200
let alone you.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:14.320
Stop chasing me

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.200
or I won't play nice anymore.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.240
Help!

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.630
No Skysplitter fragment.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.000
Then you

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.480
shall be my thrall.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:53.790
Ye.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:54.960
How come you're here?

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:57.120
I knew you'd be in danger.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.960
Ye, save me!

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:02.320
Stay further back.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.200
Watch me.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:05.440
Ye.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:07.360
Be gentle.

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:08.670
Don't kill them.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:09.840
All right.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.550
I can't believe

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:47.120
you're that strong.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.200
Let's go.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:51.670
Ye.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.510
What do you think is wrong with the villagers?

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.030
I think

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:57.000
they are being controlled.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.120
Is Weigui in danger then?

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:24.460
