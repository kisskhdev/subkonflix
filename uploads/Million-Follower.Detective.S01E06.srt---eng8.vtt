WEBVTT

00:00:15.625 --> 00:00:18.958
Let the time poet take a moment to think

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.083
He walks down the street
with candy in his mouth

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.125
Set aside the old melody for now

00:00:27.208 --> 00:00:30.541
Just sing along

00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:42.875
Let--

00:00:43.458 --> 00:00:45.291
-CONTEST NEXT WEEK
-ARE YOU GOING?

00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:46.333
SOMEONE'S OUTSIDE

00:00:46.416 --> 00:00:47.250
Loser!

00:00:51.458 --> 00:00:52.500
Chen Yu-chieh?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.833
Are you home?

00:00:58.541 --> 00:01:00.166
Why are you hiding in your room?

00:01:01.208 --> 00:01:02.708
Chen Yu-chieh, come out!

00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.208
What about your mom?

00:01:47.083 --> 00:01:48.416
What are you doing?

00:02:36.208 --> 00:02:39.666
Let the time poet take a moment to think

00:02:40.541 --> 00:02:44.250
He walks down the street
with candy in his mouth

00:02:44.875 --> 00:02:47.833
Set aside the old melody for now

00:02:47.916 --> 00:02:51.208
Just sing along

00:02:53.708 --> 00:02:54.791
That's incredible.

00:02:55.541 --> 00:02:57.291
Did you write that yourself?

00:02:57.791 --> 00:02:58.625
Yes.

00:02:59.208 --> 00:03:01.458
Who did you write it for?

00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:04.833
I wrote it for someone…

00:03:04.916 --> 00:03:06.708
that I never want to see again.

00:03:08.125 --> 00:03:10.333
Someone you never want to see again,

00:03:10.416 --> 00:03:12.541
yet you've written a song for them?

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:14.833
Is that weird?

00:03:15.916 --> 00:03:16.833
Not really.

00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:19.000
I understand how you feel.

00:03:19.083 --> 00:03:21.333
Because I also have someone
I'm willing to…

00:03:22.125 --> 00:03:24.083
I'm willing to…

00:03:29.708 --> 00:03:31.083
I'm willing…

00:03:31.166 --> 00:03:32.750
I'm willing to dance for.

00:03:32.833 --> 00:03:35.458
Someone I'm willing to dance for.

00:03:36.083 --> 00:03:38.000
Then he must be someone very special.

00:03:41.375 --> 00:03:43.416
Yes, he was my first…

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.375
First…

00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.333
-First…
-First relationship.

00:03:46.416 --> 00:03:47.708
My first love.

00:03:49.333 --> 00:03:50.583
Okay, thank you.

00:03:50.666 --> 00:03:52.250
Next time, tell Kai-hsiang

00:03:53.041 --> 00:03:54.333
these two go with this.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
AUDITION FOR "SIX BROTHERS, ONE SISTER"
PLEASE PROCEED STRAIGHT AHEAD

00:04:02.916 --> 00:04:03.750
Hey.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.458
It's okay.
Everyone's nervous the first time.

00:04:08.708 --> 00:04:10.583
I dragged you down. I'm sorry.

00:04:10.666 --> 00:04:11.875
No, you didn't.

00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.166
And technically,

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.000
it wasn't my first audition.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.000
Do you audition often?

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:18.625
Yes.

00:04:19.166 --> 00:04:20.000
Quite often.

00:04:20.083 --> 00:04:22.083
Do you want to be an actress?

00:04:22.666 --> 00:04:23.916
I guess so.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.625
But whenever there's an audience,
I end up like that.

00:04:27.583 --> 00:04:30.583
It's okay. I always get nervous
before going on stage.

00:04:31.458 --> 00:04:33.833
You mean, when you perform?

00:04:33.916 --> 00:04:35.458
Yeah. Oh, by the way…

00:04:37.166 --> 00:04:38.750
I'm in a contest next week.

00:04:41.458 --> 00:04:43.125
-Next week?
-Yeah.

00:04:43.208 --> 00:04:44.958
I've applied the last three years.

00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:46.625
I finally got in this time.

00:04:46.708 --> 00:04:47.750
You should come.

00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:57.208
That audition two years ago,

00:04:57.291 --> 00:04:59.541
was when I met Yu-chieh
for the first time.

00:05:15.416 --> 00:05:18.125
Let the time poet take a moment to think

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.291
He walks down the street
with candy in his mouth

00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:26.833
Set aside the old melody for now

00:05:26.916 --> 00:05:29.791
Just sing along

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.708
She lights up every room she walks into.

00:05:36.625 --> 00:05:40.583
Even someone as shy as me
couldn't help being drawn to her.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:52.750
Thank you.

00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:08.625
Hey!

00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.500
Girl who didn't get the part.

00:06:12.541 --> 00:06:14.750
Come on, I was just kidding.

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:16.458
I haven't heard back either.

00:06:16.541 --> 00:06:17.875
There'll be other chances.

00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.083
Want to grab a bite?

00:06:20.666 --> 00:06:23.041
Alright, come on. Let's get some food. Go!

00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:25.166
What are we eating?

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.250
Up to you.
Oden, grilled skewers, or hot pot.

00:06:28.333 --> 00:06:29.333
What's your name?

00:06:29.416 --> 00:06:30.375
Li Ting-en.

00:06:30.458 --> 00:06:31.916
I'm Chen Yu-chieh.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.625
-Chen Yu-chieh?
-Yes.

00:06:35.208 --> 00:06:36.500
YU-CHIEH: FOUND A PLACE YET?

00:06:36.583 --> 00:06:38.000
TING-EN: NO, HARD TO FIND ONE

00:06:38.083 --> 00:06:39.333
YU-CHIEH: I HAVE AN IDEA

00:06:39.416 --> 00:06:40.291
TING-EN: I'M DOWN

00:06:40.375 --> 00:06:41.958
YU-CHIEH: YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS

00:06:42.041 --> 00:06:44.708
We became best friends very quickly.

00:06:45.416 --> 00:06:46.250
One…

00:06:48.041 --> 00:06:51.041
Yu-chieh and I rented a place together..

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.875
One, two, three…

00:06:57.625 --> 00:07:00.208
Rock, paper, scissors…

00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:26.541
Rock, paper, scissors.

00:07:26.625 --> 00:07:28.583
-Hey, you were too slow.
-I win!

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.583
Thank you, everyone.

00:07:43.208 --> 00:07:47.791
Look at you being all dramatic and hyper.
Why aren't you like that at auditions?

00:07:49.125 --> 00:07:51.208
Stop talking about auditions.

00:07:51.291 --> 00:07:53.291
I haven't heard from them this time.

00:07:53.375 --> 00:07:56.250
-I didn't get it again.
-Whatever. Same here.

00:07:56.875 --> 00:07:59.125
They probably can't afford
to film it anyway.

00:07:59.208 --> 00:08:00.500
How do you know?

00:08:00.583 --> 00:08:01.916
Just a wild guess.

00:08:03.875 --> 00:08:06.250
They wouldn't case me anyway.

00:08:06.333 --> 00:08:07.250
I'm not talented.

00:08:08.916 --> 00:08:10.041
Stop saying that.

00:08:10.125 --> 00:08:11.458
Why did you hit me?

00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:13.083
It's true, though.

00:08:14.375 --> 00:08:15.541
Fine.

00:08:19.125 --> 00:08:21.458
What? Are tarots your side gig?

00:08:21.541 --> 00:08:23.333
Be quiet. You'll see in a second.

00:08:27.166 --> 00:08:29.375
Pick one of these three cards.

00:08:29.458 --> 00:08:31.875
If I'm right,
you have to stop doubting yourself.

00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.250
This isn't even accurate.

00:08:34.041 --> 00:08:35.500
Fine. This one.

00:08:38.541 --> 00:08:39.583
This one?

00:08:42.541 --> 00:08:43.750
This one.

00:08:48.208 --> 00:08:50.291
-It's this one.
-How did you know?

00:08:50.375 --> 00:08:53.166
You looked at these two, but not this one.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:54.208
That's crazy!

00:08:54.291 --> 00:08:56.083
How did you do that? Teach me.

00:08:59.416 --> 00:09:00.583
My dad taught me.

00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:03.958
I see.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:08.708
How about using this?

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:11.958
One more time.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:14.916
What do you think?

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.541
Say something with the mask on.

00:09:17.625 --> 00:09:18.541
What should I say?

00:09:18.625 --> 00:09:20.625
Say what you'd say at the audition.

00:09:20.708 --> 00:09:22.458
No, that's so weird.

00:09:22.541 --> 00:09:23.541
-Ready.
-Hey!

00:09:23.625 --> 00:09:25.750
One, two, three, action.

00:09:26.333 --> 00:09:27.791
Hi, I'm Li Ting-en,

00:09:27.875 --> 00:09:31.416
I'm 18 years old, 157 centimeters tall,
and I weigh 40 kilograms.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.500
I'm into movies and skateboarding.

00:09:33.583 --> 00:09:35.041
I like to do cat impressions…

00:09:35.125 --> 00:09:38.333
Yu-chieh wanted me to practice
being on camera with the mask on.

00:09:38.416 --> 00:09:39.416
Yeah, right.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.333
-She taught me video editing.
-It's good.

00:09:41.416 --> 00:09:42.875
She went over videos with me.

00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.125
We shouldn't post this stuff online.

00:09:45.208 --> 00:09:48.666
Celebrities already draw a following.
You should put yourself out there.

00:09:51.125 --> 00:09:53.416
I can only read from a script.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.291
How can I draw a following?

00:09:55.375 --> 00:09:57.750
Then read from a script.

00:10:02.208 --> 00:10:03.125
Read this.

00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.750
No way. Who reads newspapers out loud?

00:10:07.833 --> 00:10:10.166
Find something interesting to read.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.333
Who reads newspapers nowadays?

00:10:12.833 --> 00:10:13.708
Hey.

00:10:14.708 --> 00:10:17.166
The show we auditioned for
actually got shut down.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:18.458
Seriously?

00:10:18.541 --> 00:10:19.750
Yes.

00:10:19.833 --> 00:10:21.291
Hey, it's true.

00:10:21.375 --> 00:10:22.791
You totally jinxed it.

00:10:22.875 --> 00:10:24.708
You jinxed it.

00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:26.791
What?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.875
I just had an idea for a gimmick.
I promise it'll be good.

00:10:31.458 --> 00:10:32.625
Let's hear it.

00:10:34.208 --> 00:10:35.291
Predictions.

00:10:35.375 --> 00:10:36.750
PANDEMIC HITS FILM INDUSTRY

00:10:36.833 --> 00:10:37.875
Wait a minute.

00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.333
Why did you upload videos
from an internet cafe?

00:10:45.041 --> 00:10:47.666
Because Yu-chieh's dad
doesn't like her being online.

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:49.916
We were worried he'd find out.

00:10:51.666 --> 00:10:53.458
After all, her dad is a cop.

00:10:54.791 --> 00:10:58.000
So, you intentionally avoided the police?

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.166
Not intentionally.

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:02.916
We had very few videos.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.833
We were only uploading once a month.

00:11:05.916 --> 00:11:08.333
Anyway, it was just for fun at first.

00:11:08.416 --> 00:11:10.000
We hardly had any subscribers.

00:11:10.666 --> 00:11:12.125
But around a week ago,

00:11:12.666 --> 00:11:14.458
Yu-chieh suddenly disappeared.

00:11:17.541 --> 00:11:18.416
Excuse me.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.666
Hello.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:21.125
One hour, please.

00:11:21.208 --> 00:11:24.416
Sure, number 18. Is that okay?

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.666
-Yes, thank you.
-Okay, this way.

00:11:32.083 --> 00:11:33.875
Hey, the lighting is so nice today.

00:11:34.458 --> 00:11:35.916
-Let me take your photo.
-No.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:36.875
Come on, quick.

00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.375
-No, you took tons.
-So cute.

00:11:38.458 --> 00:11:40.291
-Get out of here.
-So cute.

00:11:40.375 --> 00:11:41.708
VIDEO FROM UNKNOWN DEVICE

00:11:42.375 --> 00:11:43.875
I just got an AirDrop request.

00:11:44.458 --> 00:11:46.666
Who'd AirDrop you right now?

00:12:00.041 --> 00:12:01.041
What did they send?

00:12:01.666 --> 00:12:02.500
Hey.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:06.083
Let me see.

00:12:07.791 --> 00:12:08.625
Wait.

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:10.333
Wait.

00:12:10.416 --> 00:12:11.958
Didn't you notice?

00:12:22.125 --> 00:12:23.833
They were in my room, too.

00:12:23.916 --> 00:12:24.958
That's so creepy.

00:12:26.083 --> 00:12:28.041
They sent it through AirDrop,

00:12:28.125 --> 00:12:30.000
doesn't that mean they're here now?

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:32.500
-Okay, stop it. They're not in here.
-Or…

00:12:33.083 --> 00:12:35.125
-Nearby, then.
-Let's go to the police.

00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.875
Yu-chieh didn't come home that night.

00:12:41.458 --> 00:12:43.458
And I received this video.

00:12:45.541 --> 00:12:48.666
They used Yu-chieh's phone
to send me a video of her.

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:50.833
We didn't have time to go to the police.

00:12:52.416 --> 00:12:54.291
POST PREDICTIONS AS WITCH BABA

00:12:54.375 --> 00:12:56.541
They wanted me to film
four predictions by date.

00:12:57.333 --> 00:13:00.625
I can't contact anyone,
or Yu-chieh will die.

00:13:05.416 --> 00:13:06.958
In the future,

00:13:07.041 --> 00:13:10.083
someone will be shot and killed.

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:13.041
-I shot an episode.
-Freeze.

00:13:13.125 --> 00:13:15.958
-I never thought Wei Yen would get shot.
-Get back.

00:13:20.125 --> 00:13:20.958
It wasn't me.

00:13:24.166 --> 00:13:26.083
I didn't know who I could trust.

00:13:38.625 --> 00:13:39.708
WHO ARE YOU EXACTLY?

00:13:39.791 --> 00:13:42.041
It wasn't until Wa Tsai sent that message

00:13:42.125 --> 00:13:44.375
that I decided to ask him to contact you.

00:13:46.666 --> 00:13:47.916
CHEN CHIA-JEN

00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.416
BULGARIAN

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:52.750
TRANSLATE

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:54.166
And the video?

00:13:54.791 --> 00:13:56.375
-Huh?
-Where's the video?

00:13:56.458 --> 00:13:58.916
Didn't you say
the killer sent you a video?

00:13:59.583 --> 00:14:01.208
Hold on. Let me find it.

00:14:02.291 --> 00:14:03.125
Here.

00:14:07.083 --> 00:14:07.916
Let me see.

00:14:08.458 --> 00:14:10.500
I've watched this video many times.

00:14:10.583 --> 00:14:13.416
There's no audio.
I can't tell where it is.

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:19.250
It's not possible.

00:14:23.708 --> 00:14:26.625
She keeps looking to the right.
What's on the right?

00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:32.541
You were looking around for the first two,
but you didn't for this one.

00:14:33.041 --> 00:14:35.166
So if I don't look, it's real?

00:14:42.541 --> 00:14:43.375
What's this?

00:14:44.791 --> 00:14:46.083
Is that an outlet?

00:14:47.625 --> 00:14:49.083
Probably just a switch.

00:14:52.291 --> 00:14:53.208
A hospital.

00:14:53.708 --> 00:14:54.625
Hospital?

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.583
Why a hospital?

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.000
UPLOAD VIDEO

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:25.875
I remember you.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:29.958
You treated Wei Meng-yen.
You also caused the chest bleed.

00:15:30.791 --> 00:15:32.125
Mr. Chen.

00:15:32.625 --> 00:15:35.000
If you hadn't shot him,
this wouldn't have happened.

YU-CHIEH

That doctor?

CALLING LI HSIN-PING

00:15:59.000 --> 00:15:59.958
Hello, Mr. Jen?

00:16:00.041 --> 00:16:02.166
Kuo Ta-fu is the serial killer.

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:04.708
Trace his phone
and check his last location.

00:16:04.791 --> 00:16:05.958
Kuo Ta-fu?

00:16:06.541 --> 00:16:07.375
But…

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:14.666

What are you doing now?

00:16:31.375 --> 00:16:34.166
Mr. Jen just called,
he wants us to look into Kuo Ta-fu.

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:36.166
So please sign the search warrant.

00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:41.333
You really don't get it.

00:16:42.625 --> 00:16:43.958
Have you learned nothing?

00:16:46.375 --> 00:16:49.416
-But Mr. Jen said that Kuo Ta-fu--
-Mr. Jen…

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.916
Which unit are you in?

00:16:55.708 --> 00:16:57.250
Mind your own business.

00:17:01.583 --> 00:17:02.666
I'm sorry.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.125
Meeting time. Let's go.

00:17:14.625 --> 00:17:15.916
I'm sorry.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.166
Don't be sorry.

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:20.041
You need intuition to work a case.

00:17:20.125 --> 00:17:21.416
If you suspect her,

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.375
find the evidence.

00:17:23.458 --> 00:17:24.375
Yes.

CHANG CHIEH
CHIEF OF CRIME INVESTIGATION

00:17:44.541 --> 00:17:45.541
Just you?

00:17:50.166 --> 00:17:51.333
What's this?

00:17:51.416 --> 00:17:52.458
Sir.

00:17:52.541 --> 00:17:56.208
Kuo Ta-fu is a key suspect
in this influencer serial killing case.

00:17:56.291 --> 00:17:58.875
Please grant us permission to investigate.

00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:00.875
You shouldn't submit this to me.

00:18:02.416 --> 00:18:03.416
Where's your leader?

00:18:09.541 --> 00:18:10.791
Did Chen Chia-jen send you?

00:18:12.666 --> 00:18:13.833
Sir, please.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.708
What you're doing

00:18:17.791 --> 00:18:19.833
is bypassing the chain of command.

00:18:23.375 --> 00:18:25.625
I'm willing to accept the consequences.

00:18:25.708 --> 00:18:26.625
Accept them?

00:18:26.708 --> 00:18:27.541
Yes.

00:18:28.083 --> 00:18:29.458
What can you accept?

00:18:33.166 --> 00:18:35.125
I'm willing to leave High-Tech Crime.

00:18:41.375 --> 00:18:43.750
Only the traffic division unit
has openings now.

00:18:49.916 --> 00:18:52.375
Fine, then assign me
to the traffic division.

00:18:52.458 --> 00:18:53.291
Sir, please.

CALL HISTORY: YU-CHIEH

00:19:25.458 --> 00:19:27.625
Yu-chieh talked about you a lot, you know.

00:19:29.166 --> 00:19:31.541
She often shared stories
from her childhood.

00:19:32.333 --> 00:19:35.541
She was always excited
to see fried rice on the shoe rack.

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:42.541
Mr. Chen,

00:19:42.625 --> 00:19:45.166
I think I can send you a video.

00:19:48.333 --> 00:19:49.833
Why didn't she tell me?

00:19:54.083 --> 00:19:56.166
She didn't know what to say to you.

00:19:58.625 --> 00:20:00.750
I never wanted to bother her.

00:20:03.458 --> 00:20:04.708
She was always so busy.

00:20:05.791 --> 00:20:07.291
She wanted to be an influencer.

00:20:08.333 --> 00:20:09.500
She wanted to sing.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.541
What I need is very simple.

00:20:18.625 --> 00:20:20.125
I just want to know…

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:22.458
if she's hungry,

00:20:22.541 --> 00:20:23.625
DINNER IS BY THE DOOR

00:20:23.708 --> 00:20:24.708
if she's happy…

00:20:26.875 --> 00:20:28.375
or if anyone's picking on her.

00:20:40.625 --> 00:20:43.333
CALLING YU-CHIEH

DAD

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:08.125
Your dad called again.

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:10.083
What do you want to reply?

00:21:16.291 --> 00:21:17.375
Save me.

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:19.333
Save you?

00:21:21.333 --> 00:21:24.958
I've been texting him from your phone
for a week, and he hasn't noticed.

00:21:25.041 --> 00:21:26.291
You two aren't close.

00:21:26.958 --> 00:21:28.250
You think he'd save you?

00:21:32.875 --> 00:21:34.333
Do you have a daughter?

00:21:39.833 --> 00:21:41.333
No, so you don't get it.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.375
Fuck!

00:21:51.875 --> 00:21:53.875
People like you got my daughter killed!

00:21:54.458 --> 00:21:56.000
Get away from me!

00:22:24.125 --> 00:22:25.000
Mr. Jen.

00:22:25.083 --> 00:22:27.750
Kuo Ta-fu's wife died
at Hekeng Hospital a year ago,

00:22:27.833 --> 00:22:28.875
from a miscarriage.

00:22:28.958 --> 00:22:31.083
Huge blood loss.
Both mother and baby died.

00:22:31.166 --> 00:22:33.375
-She was DOA.
-Both mother and baby died?

00:22:34.375 --> 00:22:36.250
When exactly was that?

00:22:36.916 --> 00:22:39.458
3:23 a.m. on the 19th.

00:22:39.541 --> 00:22:40.375
Coming through.

00:22:40.458 --> 00:22:41.291
Excuse me.

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:52.583
What's wrong?

00:22:54.375 --> 00:22:55.291
Say something.

00:23:41.416 --> 00:23:43.666
Also, Kuo Ta-fu was last seen

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:45.458
at the West Hospital Building.

00:23:45.541 --> 00:23:46.583
It's been shut down.

00:23:46.666 --> 00:23:48.625
It's used as temporary doctor housing.

00:23:48.708 --> 00:23:49.541
Got it.

00:23:54.291 --> 00:23:57.666

00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:21.208

00:24:51.416 --> 00:24:52.333
Dad!

00:24:58.166 --> 00:24:59.000
Dad!

00:25:39.541 --> 00:25:40.500
Dad!

00:25:53.291 --> 00:25:54.166
Yu-chieh!

00:26:48.291 --> 00:26:50.875
Hey, don't come in. It smells awful.

00:26:51.625 --> 00:26:53.625
Why are you painting again?

00:26:54.458 --> 00:26:56.250
I didn't know it was a girl before.

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:59.000
I told you to just paint it white.

00:26:59.083 --> 00:27:00.833
White goes with everything.

00:27:00.916 --> 00:27:02.250
No way.

00:27:02.333 --> 00:27:04.500
White looks like a hospital.
It's bad luck.

00:27:05.416 --> 00:27:07.333
What if our daughter likes blue?

00:27:07.416 --> 00:27:09.416
I'll just change it back for her.

00:27:09.916 --> 00:27:11.416
You have too much free time.

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:14.000
-Go back to work already.
-Hey.

00:27:14.083 --> 00:27:16.041
Why can't I keep Ni-ni company?

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:20.916
No.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.250
I'm not naming her Ni-ni.

00:27:22.958 --> 00:27:24.416
Ni-ni is a cute name.

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:26.291
Shouldn't we ask a fortune-teller?

00:27:27.416 --> 00:27:28.250
You're right.

00:27:29.041 --> 00:27:30.875
How about we go next week, then?

00:27:31.458 --> 00:27:33.333
No. Let's go today.

00:27:34.083 --> 00:27:36.208
The paint isn't even dry yet.

00:27:36.291 --> 00:27:37.958
But Ni-ni said

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:40.541
she wants to go out today.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:45.416
Well?

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.333
Okay.

00:27:48.208 --> 00:27:50.166

-and "Kuo--"
-Kuo Hsueh-fu?

00:28:04.291 --> 00:28:05.916
You can't be serious?

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.625
I'm very serious.

00:28:09.291 --> 00:28:12.208
Why does the fortune-teller
have to wait until she's born?

00:28:12.291 --> 00:28:15.375
How do you read a baby's fortune
without the birth chart?

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:18.833
But the due date's soon.

00:28:26.625 --> 00:28:27.625
Who bought these?

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:32.541
You buy her shoes every time you go out.

00:28:33.375 --> 00:28:34.583
Come on.

00:28:34.666 --> 00:28:37.708
A girl can never have too many shoes.

00:28:43.125 --> 00:28:44.208
How much were they?

00:28:44.291 --> 00:28:45.916
They were cheap.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.208
Holy cow!

00:28:49.708 --> 00:28:51.541
That's ridiculous.

00:29:00.541 --> 00:29:01.541
Are you okay?

00:29:02.041 --> 00:29:02.875
Yeah.

00:29:03.375 --> 00:29:04.958
It's okay. I'm fine.

00:29:06.541 --> 00:29:07.875
Come on. Just ignore them.

00:29:09.166 --> 00:29:10.875
No way. They're out of line.

00:29:12.083 --> 00:29:13.125
-Hey, wait.
-Shit.

00:29:13.208 --> 00:29:15.250
-What?
-Can we even post this on UTurn?

00:29:15.333 --> 00:29:17.375
Who cares? Don't overthink it.

00:29:17.458 --> 00:29:19.833
-Faster…
-This is ridiculous.

00:29:22.625 --> 00:29:23.833
That's ridiculous.

00:29:35.416 --> 00:29:36.250
Fuck.

00:29:41.041 --> 00:29:42.833
Shit. That's not good.

00:29:45.375 --> 00:29:46.208
Let's go.

00:29:47.291 --> 00:29:48.416
Do we call the police?

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.125
-Let's go.
-It won't start.

00:29:51.208 --> 00:29:52.333
Hurry up, let's go.

00:29:52.416 --> 00:29:53.875
What the heck?

00:29:55.208 --> 00:29:56.208
-Ting-yu!
-Let's go!

00:29:56.291 --> 00:29:57.250
Let's go!

00:29:57.916 --> 00:29:58.750
Come on!

00:30:03.583 --> 00:30:04.541
Honey.

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:06.333
Are you hurt?

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.083
Are you okay?

00:30:11.791 --> 00:30:13.000
My water…

00:30:13.541 --> 00:30:15.250
I think my water broke.

00:30:16.375 --> 00:30:18.583
Hang in there.
We're going to the hospital.

00:30:18.666 --> 00:30:19.500
Hold on.

00:31:18.208 --> 00:31:19.083
Honey.

00:31:21.916 --> 00:31:22.750
Honey.

00:31:32.666 --> 00:31:34.875
Honey…

00:31:37.291 --> 00:31:38.958
Help!

00:31:39.666 --> 00:31:41.291
Help!

00:31:43.541 --> 00:31:45.416
Help!

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:47.166
Is anyone there?

00:31:48.458 --> 00:31:50.458
Please! Help!

00:31:51.125 --> 00:31:52.458
Help!

00:32:04.333 --> 00:32:06.125
-Sir.
-Stop her bleeding first, she…

00:32:06.208 --> 00:32:07.208
We're handling it.

00:32:07.291 --> 00:32:08.708
Sir, trust us.

00:32:27.041 --> 00:32:28.333
Mr. Kuo.

00:32:28.416 --> 00:32:30.375
This video captures everything clearly.

00:32:31.375 --> 00:32:33.250
This is a public safety offense.

00:32:33.791 --> 00:32:35.416
Our chances of winning are high.

00:32:39.333 --> 00:32:40.750
-Public safety offense?
-Yes.

00:32:41.416 --> 00:32:43.708
They can be sentenced
to at least seven years.

00:32:44.458 --> 00:32:45.541
Seven years?

00:32:45.625 --> 00:32:46.458
Yes.

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.291
They killed my wife and child,

00:32:52.791 --> 00:32:55.041
and they only get seven years?

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:58.416
Mr. Kuo, I have to be honest with you.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:01.708
It'll be hard to convict them
of negligent homicide in this case.

00:33:03.583 --> 00:33:05.000
What's hard about it?

00:33:05.666 --> 00:33:08.000
Their fucking license plates and faces

00:33:08.083 --> 00:33:09.458
are in the video!

00:33:09.541 --> 00:33:11.166
What's hard about that?

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:13.125
They didn't cause the car to flip.

00:33:13.208 --> 00:33:14.083
They didn't?

00:33:14.166 --> 00:33:15.291
So if you're driving,

00:33:15.375 --> 00:33:17.750
it's normal for a tire blow out
to flip a car?

00:33:17.833 --> 00:33:20.250
Mr. Kuo, yelling at me won't help.

00:33:20.833 --> 00:33:23.541
Please remain calm, okay?
I'm just stating the facts.

00:34:02.833 --> 00:34:04.375
Hey, don't come in.

00:34:04.458 --> 00:34:05.541
It smells awful.

00:34:06.166 --> 00:34:07.875
Why are you painting again?

00:34:08.375 --> 00:34:10.458
I didn't know it was a girl before.

00:34:10.541 --> 00:34:12.666
I told you to just paint it white.

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:14.458
White goes with everything.

00:34:22.833 --> 00:34:25.125
What if our daughter likes blue?

00:34:25.208 --> 00:34:26.875
I'll just change it back for her.

00:34:27.458 --> 00:34:30.375
You have too much free time.
Go back to work already.

00:34:33.125 --> 00:34:34.916
But Ni-ni said

00:34:35.666 --> 00:34:37.500
she wants to go out today.

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:19.083
Come on. Just ignore them.

00:35:19.833 --> 00:35:21.500
No way. They're out of line.

00:35:35.333 --> 00:35:36.708

BABA'S FOOD PICKS IN TAINAN

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:09.958
Hello, everyone.

00:36:10.041 --> 00:36:11.916
Welcome to Witch Baba.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.166
I'm Baba.

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:15.208
Today is May 19th.

00:36:15.291 --> 00:36:18.833
Last time,
I predicted a car accident. Voila!

00:36:18.916 --> 00:36:20.833
It actually happened, right?

00:36:20.916 --> 00:36:23.458
I told you guys to drive carefully.

00:36:23.541 --> 00:36:26.458
The car accident was fatal.

00:36:26.541 --> 00:36:29.375
That's pretty serious, isn't it?

00:36:29.958 --> 00:36:33.875
So, where did you guys go
this long weekend?

00:36:33.958 --> 00:36:35.375
Baba went to Tainan

00:36:35.458 --> 00:36:38.000
and ate way too much.

00:36:38.083 --> 00:36:40.041
Alright, that's it for today.

00:36:40.125 --> 00:36:41.083
Let's draw…

00:36:42.833 --> 00:36:43.875
NEIHU FATAL CAR CRASH

00:36:45.041 --> 00:36:46.875
It actually happened, right?

00:36:46.958 --> 00:36:49.500
I told you guys to drive carefully.

00:36:49.583 --> 00:36:52.375
The car accident was fatal.

00:36:52.458 --> 00:36:55.291
That's pretty serious, isn't it?

00:36:57.750 --> 00:37:00.291

00:37:26.708 --> 00:37:28.000
CID AGENT

00:37:31.666 --> 00:37:33.166
What have you found?

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:34.083
Sir.

00:37:35.291 --> 00:37:36.666
The Wei Meng-yen shooting

00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:38.875
was actually orchestrated by Kuo Ta-fu.

00:37:38.958 --> 00:37:40.458
Take a look at this.

00:37:41.916 --> 00:37:43.291
He threatened Wei Meng-yen.

00:37:43.375 --> 00:37:45.875
If he didn't comply,
he'd upload this video.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:49.250
But there is something odd.

00:37:51.375 --> 00:37:53.083
Why is this video

00:37:53.666 --> 00:37:55.791
different from the one online?

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:09.083
-Mr. Ho?
-Yes?

00:38:09.166 --> 00:38:11.250
We need Mr. Chen
to confirm the victim's phone.

00:38:12.166 --> 00:38:13.708
A-Li, give it to Chia-jen.

00:38:17.083 --> 00:38:17.916
Okay.

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:22.500
Check it again.

00:38:22.583 --> 00:38:23.416
Okay.

00:38:39.125 --> 00:38:40.125
CID AGENT

00:38:44.375 --> 00:38:45.208
Mr. Jen.

00:38:46.916 --> 00:38:48.083
Yu-chieh's phone.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:27.916
HOW'S EVERYTHING?

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:28.833
GOOD

00:39:39.333 --> 00:39:40.875
-WHERE ARE YOU?
-I'M AT HOME

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:15.958
All the evidence is gone.

00:40:16.666 --> 00:40:17.791
What do we do now?

00:40:22.125 --> 00:40:23.625
What about his old place?

00:40:24.458 --> 00:40:27.083
He sold it after his wife passed away.

00:40:27.625 --> 00:40:29.708
He has no contact with friends or family.

00:40:30.916 --> 00:40:31.750
Shit.

00:40:49.958 --> 00:40:51.541
I'm the only target left alive.

00:40:52.291 --> 00:40:53.458
I'll go live to bait him.

00:40:56.041 --> 00:40:57.083
Are you sure?

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.208
WITCH BABA

00:41:24.291 --> 00:41:25.166
Hello, everyone.

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:27.083
Here's the next prediction.

00:41:27.166 --> 00:41:30.291
Tomorrow, at KOL STAGE,

00:41:30.375 --> 00:41:34.250
Ting-yu will die.

00:45:36.666 --> 00:45:41.666
