WEBVTT

00:00:00.265 --> 00:00:03.683
The Botpleng I know is you.

00:00:03.814 --> 00:00:05.377
It has always been you, dude.

00:00:05.745 --> 00:00:06.955
You’re Tontharn, right?

00:00:07.855 --> 00:00:09.203
This might seem too early

00:00:09.595 --> 00:00:11.130
but I think I like you.

00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:13.290
Can we get to know each other?

00:00:15.165 --> 00:00:16.155
(In my life, )

00:00:16.185 --> 00:00:17.828
(I’ve never gotten to choose anything.)

00:00:17.855 --> 00:00:20.665
(Just going with what’s chosen for me.)

00:00:20.694 --> 00:00:22.875
(I’m an orphan my parents chose to abandon.)

00:00:23.365 --> 00:00:25.770
(The kind housemom chose to take me in.)

00:00:26.645 --> 00:00:27.799
(Growing up a little more, )

00:00:27.828 --> 00:00:30.068
(a kind family chose me to adopt.)

00:00:30.285 --> 00:00:33.275
(I was chosen to save his child’s life.)

00:00:41.045 --> 00:00:42.045
Hey!

00:00:44.705 --> 00:00:45.748
Let go of me, Tan!

00:00:46.225 --> 00:00:47.385
Let go of me, Tan!

00:00:47.421 --> 00:00:48.323
Let go of me, Tan!

00:00:48.352 --> 00:00:49.225
Don’t do it, Thun.

00:00:49.261 --> 00:00:50.279
You can’t do it.

00:00:51.055 --> 00:00:52.897
If you get hurt, I’ll get hurt too.

00:00:53.645 --> 00:00:54.897
Let go, Tan!

00:00:55.275 --> 00:00:56.745
Tell me what’s wrong.

00:00:56.774 --> 00:00:57.988
I’ll help you.

00:00:58.785 --> 00:01:00.505
What if I have a problem with Dad?

00:01:00.555 --> 00:01:01.625
How would you help me?

00:01:10.245 --> 00:01:11.515
You had a fight with Dad again?

00:01:14.495 --> 00:01:15.937
I don’t want to be like Dad.

00:01:17.755 --> 00:01:19.315
I don’t want to study what Dad studied.

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.115
I don’t get why he has to force me.

00:01:23.105 --> 00:01:24.105
I love the violin.

00:01:24.815 --> 00:01:26.148
I want to learn about the violin.

00:01:26.625 --> 00:01:28.235
I don’t know when I’m going to die.

00:01:29.665 --> 00:01:32.039
I just want to live life the way I want.

00:01:37.745 --> 00:01:38.890
I’ll talk to Dad.

00:01:40.675 --> 00:01:41.915
I’ll study that instead of you.

00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:49.545
But don’t you want to become a doctor?

00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:54.010
I want you to live life the way you want.

00:01:55.535 --> 00:01:56.535
As for me.

00:01:57.625 --> 00:01:58.883
I can be anything.

00:02:00.885 --> 00:02:03.915
If you love the violin and want to play it,

00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:06.330
then do it all you want.

00:02:16.895 --> 00:02:17.895
Tan.

00:02:24.495 --> 00:02:25.495
(That’s right.)

00:02:25.735 --> 00:02:26.992
(I can be anything.)

00:02:27.675 --> 00:02:28.905
(I’m used to it.)

00:02:29.603 --> 00:02:31.605
(To live the life others choose for me.)

00:02:36.145 --> 00:02:37.552
(But he came in and changed it.)

00:02:43.465 --> 00:02:44.795
(After meeting Tontharn, )

00:02:45.785 --> 00:02:46.890
(it was the first time)

00:02:47.155 --> 00:02:49.581
(that I think about living a life for myself.)

00:03:04.005 --> 00:03:05.005
Hello.

00:03:05.775 --> 00:03:06.970
My name is Tankhun.

00:03:08.495 --> 00:03:09.806
You’re Tontharn, right?

00:03:13.335 --> 00:03:14.875
It might seem too early

00:03:16.035 --> 00:03:17.385
but I think I like you.

00:03:19.523 --> 00:03:21.137
Can we get to know each other?

00:05:01.015 --> 00:05:02.410
Here it is.

00:05:02.446 --> 00:05:04.323
Fresh vegetable salad with lots of tomatoes.

00:05:04.345 --> 00:05:05.406
Just the way you like it.

00:05:10.035 --> 00:05:11.072
Thank you.

00:05:13.295 --> 00:05:14.206
It’s alright.

00:05:14.235 --> 00:05:16.199
I was only adding the dressing to the vegetables.

00:05:17.755 --> 00:05:19.079
Thanks for coming back to me.

00:05:23.215 --> 00:05:24.483
So that means

00:05:25.235 --> 00:05:26.715
you’re letting me make my moves?

00:05:30.095 --> 00:05:31.152
You know

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.003
how I feel, right?

00:05:37.085 --> 00:05:38.105
You’re confused.

00:05:39.305 --> 00:05:40.305
Happy.

00:05:40.595 --> 00:05:41.595
And afraid.

00:05:44.105 --> 00:05:45.646
When a person feels this way,

00:05:46.895 --> 00:05:48.672
how can he love anyone, Tan?

00:05:49.792 --> 00:05:51.795
The Tontharn inside me is empty.

00:05:52.675 --> 00:05:54.403
Full of guilt for Pleng.

00:05:55.295 --> 00:05:55.828
I’m afraid that who I really am

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.003
wouldn’t be the one you love.

00:05:59.385 --> 00:06:00.912
I’m afraid that I might hurt you.

00:06:02.705 --> 00:06:04.294
I’m not ready to love, Tan.

00:06:11.665 --> 00:06:13.545
The only thing I fear in life

00:06:14.965 --> 00:06:16.570
is not having you in my life.

00:06:18.425 --> 00:06:20.065
No matter how you want to live your life,

00:06:22.135 --> 00:06:23.603
you can go at it all you want.

00:06:25.115 --> 00:06:26.759
Just let me stay beside you.

00:06:30.175 --> 00:06:31.697
Whenever you’re ready to love,

00:06:32.941 --> 00:06:35.130
I’ll be waiting for that day, Tontharn.

00:06:45.675 --> 00:06:48.075
Actually, I didn’t like vegetables
because of how they taste.

00:06:49.435 --> 00:06:49.959
But when I was younger,

00:06:49.981 --> 00:06:51.683
vegetables were easier to find than meat.

00:06:56.045 --> 00:06:57.246
This is Tontharn.

00:06:58.795 --> 00:07:00.795
A poor child with no preferences.

00:07:01.635 --> 00:07:02.774
No dreams.

00:07:04.415 --> 00:07:06.083
Let’s get to know him together, Tan.

00:07:10.595 --> 00:07:13.035
Nice to meet you, Tontharn.

00:07:17.325 --> 00:07:19.094
(The life I want for myself)

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:21.695
(is living with this person.)

00:07:22.675 --> 00:07:25.603
(Doesn’t matter if he’s Botpleng or Tontharn.)

00:07:29.535 --> 00:07:31.079
Soft or fluffy?

00:07:31.955 --> 00:07:32.955
Soft.

00:07:38.097 --> 00:07:40.054
Cooling or dense.

00:07:41.535 --> 00:07:42.535
Cooling.

00:07:49.865 --> 00:07:51.683
White or black?

00:07:52.495 --> 00:07:55.290
Are you pulling my legs?

00:08:02.245 --> 00:08:03.632
I want to get to know you quickly.

00:08:03.905 --> 00:08:05.348
So we can become close in no time.

00:08:06.755 --> 00:08:08.105
You’re giving me headaches.

00:08:10.805 --> 00:08:11.828
Headaches?

00:08:12.145 --> 00:08:13.515
You look so happy, though.

00:08:13.955 --> 00:08:15.675
I’ve never seen you smile like this before.

00:08:16.615 --> 00:08:17.923
How can you?

00:08:18.295 --> 00:08:19.655
We’ve just got to know each other.

00:08:21.125 --> 00:08:22.125
Hey!

00:08:23.665 --> 00:08:25.923
How can you do that to someone you just met?

00:08:26.895 --> 00:08:27.530
I’m not okay with this.

00:08:27.566 --> 00:08:28.566
Get out.

00:08:28.765 --> 00:08:29.765
Go away.

00:08:31.515 --> 00:08:33.290
You’re the one who waltzed into my house.

00:08:34.035 --> 00:08:36.366
I’m only arresting the intruder.

00:08:37.305 --> 00:08:38.305
Tan!

00:08:40.195 --> 00:08:40.897
Hey!

00:08:41.105 --> 00:08:42.577
This is not it!

00:08:57.815 --> 00:08:58.708
See?

00:08:58.745 --> 00:09:00.563
I told you it would look good here.

00:09:01.555 --> 00:09:02.555
Yeah.

00:09:04.055 --> 00:09:05.283
It’s your turn now.

00:09:06.415 --> 00:09:08.112
Hmm? What?

00:09:09.145 --> 00:09:10.145
Well.

00:09:13.045 --> 00:09:15.574
I want to know the one who’s hitting on me, too.

00:09:16.614 --> 00:09:18.615
Tell me about your childhood.

00:09:18.995 --> 00:09:19.995
Sure.

00:09:20.195 --> 00:09:21.195
What do you want to ask?

00:09:25.821 --> 00:09:28.039
Why did you want to become a criminologist?

00:09:30.575 --> 00:09:32.803
Actually, I didn’t want to become a criminologist.

00:09:33.585 --> 00:09:34.905
I studied it instead of Thunphob.

00:09:36.555 --> 00:09:38.035
I actually wanted to become a doctor.

00:09:40.025 --> 00:09:41.675
Not quite, actually.

00:09:41.705 --> 00:09:43.174
I wanted to be anything

00:09:43.485 --> 00:09:45.828
that can make my adoptive parents proud.

00:09:47.457 --> 00:09:49.455
But I’ve just found a new life,

00:09:49.795 --> 00:09:51.072
after meeting you.

00:09:53.075 --> 00:09:54.090
A new life?

00:09:58.955 --> 00:10:00.512
A life where I want to be with you.

00:10:06.085 --> 00:10:07.085
Hey.

00:10:07.375 --> 00:10:08.781
We’ve just got to know each other.

00:10:08.825 --> 00:10:09.988
How can you do this?

00:10:10.865 --> 00:10:11.865
Oh?

00:10:12.555 --> 00:10:14.483
Didn’t you want to get to know me?

00:10:15.065 --> 00:10:18.097
I just want to try a one-night stand.

00:10:30.915 --> 00:10:32.737
This is not me giving consent to this.

00:10:33.695 --> 00:10:36.323
Because for me, there’s only

00:10:38.425 --> 00:10:40.199
every night forever.

00:11:26.035 --> 00:11:27.035
Thank you.

00:11:32.885 --> 00:11:34.221
Dao confessed.

00:11:35.646 --> 00:11:37.726
She didn’t want me to be the one
who solved the case.

00:11:38.435 --> 00:11:40.061
She’s the type to not give in to anyone

00:11:40.545 --> 00:11:42.105
even when it comes to things like this.

00:11:44.265 --> 00:11:46.425
At least her craziness brought the case to a close.

00:11:48.985 --> 00:11:50.483
Now it’s time for my businesses

00:11:51.405 --> 00:11:52.621
that have to be ended.

00:11:59.565 --> 00:12:01.028
Why are you resigning?

00:12:01.455 --> 00:12:03.244
If you’re stressed, then you can take a break.

00:12:03.268 --> 00:12:05.265
You can take as many day-offs you want.

00:12:06.355 --> 00:12:07.355
How many?

00:12:07.825 --> 00:12:08.825
3 months?

00:12:09.955 --> 00:12:10.999
Fine, 6 months?

00:12:12.445 --> 00:12:13.445
Right.

00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:15.174
Thanks a lot.

00:12:16.075 --> 00:12:17.763
I’m only becoming a journalist

00:12:18.115 --> 00:12:19.850
because it’s Pleng’s dream.

00:12:20.815 --> 00:12:21.815
I think

00:12:22.895 --> 00:12:24.468
this is no longer a place for me.

00:12:25.079 --> 00:12:26.319
What are you going to do, then?

00:12:29.015 --> 00:12:30.599
I’m going to look for that answer.

00:12:31.695 --> 00:12:33.617
I haven’t got to be myself for so many years.

00:12:33.639 --> 00:12:35.615
I don’t even know what I like to do.

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:50.770
Go for it.

00:12:51.155 --> 00:12:52.155
I’m rooting for you.

00:12:53.235 --> 00:12:54.650
But whoever you are,

00:12:55.215 --> 00:12:56.381
you’re still my friend.

00:13:00.895 --> 00:13:02.505
You’re so cliché.

00:13:04.475 --> 00:13:06.105
Are you really going to quit?

00:13:06.505 --> 00:13:07.195
Yeah.

00:13:07.475 --> 00:13:10.628
Then who’s going to stop Boss when he’s angry?

00:13:10.672 --> 00:13:12.534
Don’t you feel sorry for us?

00:13:13.855 --> 00:13:15.777
He doesn’t want to be a journalist anymore.

00:13:16.945 --> 00:13:18.475
Why are you pressuring my friend?

00:13:18.497 --> 00:13:19.821
Or do you…

00:13:21.095 --> 00:13:22.897
want to quit along with him?

00:13:23.505 --> 00:13:25.006
Come on, Boss!

00:13:25.625 --> 00:13:26.643
Mile!

00:13:28.805 --> 00:13:29.805
Just kidding.

00:13:31.085 --> 00:13:32.085
Let’s go.

00:13:32.285 --> 00:13:33.915
Let’s have a farewell meal for Tontharn.

00:13:35.475 --> 00:13:36.708
Can we do that later?

00:13:36.745 --> 00:13:37.745
Huh?

00:13:37.775 --> 00:13:39.175
I have an urgent appointment today.

00:13:39.345 --> 00:13:40.745
Come on!

00:13:41.315 --> 00:13:42.781
What a miss!

00:13:43.015 --> 00:13:44.272
Let’s do that next time.

00:13:57.535 --> 00:13:58.535
Kan.

00:13:58.895 --> 00:14:01.355
I have the maid prepare your food.

00:14:01.385 --> 00:14:02.679
It will get cold.

00:14:05.295 --> 00:14:06.643
You can go ahead, Mom.

00:14:07.295 --> 00:14:08.490
I’m not hungry.

00:14:09.935 --> 00:14:10.935
Hello.

00:14:23.265 --> 00:14:24.875
Can we talk?

00:14:26.095 --> 00:14:27.341
Sure, son.

00:14:28.643 --> 00:14:30.214
Have you eaten?

00:14:30.805 --> 00:14:32.148
Let’s eat together.

00:14:33.123 --> 00:14:34.123
It’s alright.

00:14:36.255 --> 00:14:37.639
I’m just here to say goodbye.

00:14:55.465 --> 00:14:57.465
Thank you so much, Mom Kan.

00:14:59.055 --> 00:15:00.505
For raising me like your own son.

00:15:03.715 --> 00:15:05.355
But I’m not Botpleng.

00:15:06.505 --> 00:15:08.112
I’m not your child.

00:15:09.385 --> 00:15:11.043
No, Tontharn.

00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:14.119
You’re my son.

00:15:19.645 --> 00:15:22.403
I made your family go through horrible things.

00:15:24.115 --> 00:15:25.850
I don’t deserve to be your son.

00:15:28.895 --> 00:15:34.170
Goodbye, Mom Kan and Grandma.

00:16:31.215 --> 00:16:33.959
Thanks for not getting at me
for hypnotizing you.

00:16:34.655 --> 00:16:36.985
Also, sorry for everything so far.

00:16:42.705 --> 00:16:45.945
It’s me who should apologize to you.

00:16:46.715 --> 00:16:47.715
It was because of me.

00:16:48.365 --> 00:16:49.705
Because of my family,

00:16:51.254 --> 00:16:53.255
that you and Mom had to lose Pleng.

00:16:55.255 --> 00:16:57.094
I should be thanking you.

00:16:58.515 --> 00:17:00.105
It’s because of your presence

00:17:01.305 --> 00:17:03.195
that I still have Tontharn left.

00:17:05.135 --> 00:17:06.337
Thank you so much.

00:17:10.335 --> 00:17:11.392
Goodbye.

00:17:32.835 --> 00:17:33.835
Grandma.

00:17:35.295 --> 00:17:36.308
From now on,

00:17:37.795 --> 00:17:39.697
you can miss Pleng all you want.

00:17:55.421 --> 00:17:58.010
6 MONTHS LATER.

00:17:58.039 --> 00:18:00.381
Keep taking good care of yourself like this, Tontharn.

00:18:00.545 --> 00:18:02.563
You’re doing much better.

00:18:02.599 --> 00:18:04.868
If you have anything before the appointment date,

00:18:04.897 --> 00:18:06.057
feel free to call me anytime.

00:18:06.335 --> 00:18:07.335
Thank you.

00:18:13.645 --> 00:18:16.694
Then, I’ll take your patient home.

00:18:17.185 --> 00:18:18.432
Well, well.

00:18:18.483 --> 00:18:19.930
You’re always giving him a lift.

00:18:20.075 --> 00:18:21.755
Never leave each other’s side like lovers.

00:18:23.785 --> 00:18:25.785
Um, we’re not lovers yet.

00:18:26.352 --> 00:18:27.966
We’re just getting to know each other.

00:18:28.175 --> 00:18:29.777
We haven’t put a label on it yet.

00:18:31.775 --> 00:18:34.163
Sounds so much like a Gen Z relationship.

00:18:34.192 --> 00:18:35.479
Are you okay with that, Tan?

00:18:36.345 --> 00:18:37.345
Of course.

00:18:37.645 --> 00:18:39.462
As long as he’s in the talking stage with me only.

00:18:39.486 --> 00:18:40.345
I’m all good.

00:18:40.454 --> 00:18:41.523
Come on.

00:18:41.581 --> 00:18:42.628
I’m always with you.

00:18:42.865 --> 00:18:44.505
How can I find time to talk to others?

00:18:45.575 --> 00:18:46.708
Are you saying that

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:48.290
because you’re thinking about doing it?

00:18:49.215 --> 00:18:50.723
Are you going to let me be by myself?

00:18:52.545 --> 00:18:54.279
Not putting any label on it

00:18:54.563 --> 00:18:56.250
but so clear on the actions.

00:18:57.275 --> 00:18:58.577
Gen Z, indeed.

00:19:01.625 --> 00:19:02.926
Then I’ll be leaving.

00:19:05.485 --> 00:19:06.485
See you.

00:19:26.195 --> 00:19:27.683
Have you started to realize your sin?

00:19:29.325 --> 00:19:30.635
I didn’t do anything wrong.

00:19:33.025 --> 00:19:35.072
It’s you who’ve been fooled.

00:19:35.625 --> 00:19:37.603
No matter how much you think you’re a victim,

00:19:38.895 --> 00:19:42.061
it’s not enough of a reason to kill someone.

00:20:00.915 --> 00:20:02.083
Becoming a murderer

00:20:03.985 --> 00:20:05.028
was your choice.

00:20:06.895 --> 00:20:08.483
Therefore, it’s you who’s evil.

00:20:16.215 --> 00:20:17.392
Stop blaming others.

00:20:18.625 --> 00:20:20.715
Stop finding reasons to justify yourself.

00:20:22.405 --> 00:20:23.697
You can’t fool anyone anymore.

00:20:24.365 --> 00:20:25.450
Except for yourself.

00:20:32.985 --> 00:20:33.985
Where are you going?

00:20:36.965 --> 00:20:38.054
I’m not guilty.

00:20:39.235 --> 00:20:40.672
I’m not guilty!

00:20:41.075 --> 00:20:42.526
You guys are the evil ones.

00:20:42.548 --> 00:20:44.046
I’m not guilty!

00:20:44.083 --> 00:20:45.225
You devils!

00:20:45.555 --> 00:20:46.897
You guys are the evil ones!

00:20:47.217 --> 00:20:48.403
I’m not guilty!

00:20:48.745 --> 00:20:49.472
Where are you going?!

00:20:49.501 --> 00:20:50.308
I’m not guilty!

00:20:50.345 --> 00:20:51.345
Let go!

00:20:51.675 --> 00:20:52.675
Let go!

00:20:53.325 --> 00:20:55.261
I’m not guilty, let go of me!

00:20:55.297 --> 00:20:56.468
Let go!

00:20:56.505 --> 00:20:57.505
Let go!

00:20:58.625 --> 00:21:00.061
I’m not guilty!

00:21:09.123 --> 00:21:10.323
Do you want me to go with you?

00:21:11.245 --> 00:21:12.245
It’s alright.

00:21:24.885 --> 00:21:26.708
I’m sorry, Tontharn.

00:21:37.785 --> 00:21:39.275
Are you settling in here alright?

00:21:47.615 --> 00:21:48.615
Sure.

00:21:49.312 --> 00:21:50.519
Easy.

00:21:52.055 --> 00:21:55.283
At least I don’t have to run away

00:21:57.905 --> 00:21:59.319
from the guilt,

00:22:00.405 --> 00:22:01.566
or from the truth

00:22:03.145 --> 00:22:04.868
that I can never escape.

00:22:08.145 --> 00:22:09.683
Please take care of yourself.

00:22:12.374 --> 00:22:13.374
Dad.

00:22:38.575 --> 00:22:39.895
Does your heart feel lighter now?

00:22:42.155 --> 00:22:43.155
Yes.

00:22:43.515 --> 00:22:46.155
But not quite entirely.

00:22:47.985 --> 00:22:49.006
Hey! Watch out!

00:22:50.035 --> 00:22:51.181
Sorry!

00:23:02.545 --> 00:23:04.875
It’s been 6 months since that day.

00:23:10.145 --> 00:23:11.145
Hey.

00:23:11.585 --> 00:23:12.945
I thought you said you could wait.

00:23:13.585 --> 00:23:14.585
I can wait.

00:23:15.095 --> 00:23:16.454
Just want to know

00:23:16.455 --> 00:23:17.655
if you’ve leaned in to me yet.

00:23:23.685 --> 00:23:25.290
In Tontharn’s heart,

00:23:26.605 --> 00:23:28.068
how far have I come through?

00:23:38.055 --> 00:23:39.065
Just know that

00:23:40.545 --> 00:23:41.545
in here,

00:23:42.995 --> 00:23:44.279
there’s only you.

00:23:44.625 --> 00:23:45.625
Okay?

00:23:46.735 --> 00:23:47.735
Yeah.

00:23:48.455 --> 00:23:49.975
Even if I have to wait my entire life,

00:23:50.245 --> 00:23:51.245
I’m up for it.

00:23:55.195 --> 00:23:56.195
Hey.

00:23:57.655 --> 00:23:59.254
Come on. Let’s go.

00:24:07.255 --> 00:24:08.272
TITLE DEED.

00:24:08.305 --> 00:24:11.457
This is where you can hear the waterfall, Tontharn.

00:24:15.695 --> 00:24:17.095
You want me to call you a rich man?

00:24:18.825 --> 00:24:20.221
I’m inviting you to invest.

00:24:24.535 --> 00:24:25.535
This is the place.

00:24:26.355 --> 00:24:29.123
Thunphob wanted to give Botpleng.

00:24:31.215 --> 00:24:34.883
This is where you can hear the water source.

00:24:37.075 --> 00:24:38.075
And this place

00:24:40.705 --> 00:24:44.519
is where you’ll get to achieve your dream.

00:24:48.065 --> 00:24:50.992
How did you know

00:24:51.035 --> 00:24:52.585
that I want to run a homestay?

00:24:56.585 --> 00:25:00.003
I want to build a home

00:25:01.195 --> 00:25:03.028
for those searching for a home like me.

00:25:07.315 --> 00:25:08.941
But isn’t this too much?

00:25:09.615 --> 00:25:11.843
I don’t have any money to invest with you.

00:25:13.715 --> 00:25:14.715
I know.

00:25:20.985 --> 00:25:22.381
So I brought you this.

00:25:30.475 --> 00:25:32.235
LOAN AGREEMENT.

00:25:32.615 --> 00:25:34.432
The interest rate with the bank is expensive.

00:25:34.468 --> 00:25:35.908
You’ll need a long time to pay back.

00:25:35.955 --> 00:25:38.679
You’ll have to take longer to achieve things.

00:25:40.555 --> 00:25:41.851
Are you not going to wait for me?

00:25:41.875 --> 00:25:43.166
When I say I’m going to wait,

00:25:43.515 --> 00:25:44.745
I mean it.

00:25:45.225 --> 00:25:46.897
But can’t I have a little shortcut?

00:25:47.505 --> 00:25:49.632
Instead of paying the high interest rate to the bank,

00:25:50.055 --> 00:25:51.683
I’d rather you give that money to me.

00:25:52.005 --> 00:25:53.428
I won’t make the interest too high.

00:25:53.805 --> 00:25:54.965
Won’t be harsh on you either.

00:25:56.415 --> 00:25:57.735
I’m sick of this rich man’s face.

00:26:13.095 --> 00:26:14.825
Are you going to look for another rich man?

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:17.375
I’m going to make money
to pay back the rich man.

00:26:19.175 --> 00:26:21.355
Thank you for waiting.

00:26:22.795 --> 00:26:24.105
I want you to know

00:26:24.655 --> 00:26:25.937
that you’re not alone.

00:26:27.755 --> 00:26:29.115
Whenever you want to fuel up,

00:26:30.295 --> 00:26:31.581
you can come and hug me.

00:26:34.355 --> 00:26:35.450
Who would want that?

00:26:39.348 --> 00:26:40.348
Hmm.

00:26:42.085 --> 00:26:43.981
RAI YAI YAEM HOMESTAY.

00:26:44.945 --> 00:26:46.145
I’m giving you only this once.

00:26:47.465 --> 00:26:48.650
Plus a ‘one night’?

00:26:49.955 --> 00:26:51.210
You’re driving me crazy!

00:26:54.235 --> 00:26:55.235
Thank you.

00:28:09.605 --> 00:28:11.159
It’s like a dream come true.

00:28:13.952 --> 00:28:15.130
Congratulations.

00:28:18.075 --> 00:28:19.574
What about you?

00:28:20.245 --> 00:28:21.297
Do you have a dream?

00:28:25.075 --> 00:28:26.075
Well.

00:28:27.255 --> 00:28:28.345
A dream?

00:28:30.635 --> 00:28:32.134
I might not have had it in the past,

00:28:32.985 --> 00:28:34.257
but I do now.

00:28:36.535 --> 00:28:38.155
I want to build a peaceful world

00:28:38.177 --> 00:28:39.305
for the people I love.

00:28:40.455 --> 00:28:43.828
So I’m happy working with the police.

00:28:45.885 --> 00:28:47.523
To get to know what the criminals think

00:28:48.545 --> 00:28:49.690
so we can fix it

00:28:50.275 --> 00:28:51.435
and prevent things in time.

00:28:54.865 --> 00:28:56.206
Just like how you helped me.

00:29:02.255 --> 00:29:03.559
If I haven’t met you,

00:29:05.315 --> 00:29:07.443
I would have been living life as I was told.

00:29:09.445 --> 00:29:10.875
You’re the inspiration

00:29:11.235 --> 00:29:13.283
for me to have a dream, Tontharn.

00:29:16.365 --> 00:29:17.479
Without you,

00:29:19.295 --> 00:29:20.817
I wouldn’t have dared to dream either.

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:45.799
FIRST LOVE HOMESTAY.

00:29:49.501 --> 00:29:50.501
One second.

00:29:56.815 --> 00:29:57.815
Hello?

00:29:59.605 --> 00:30:02.192
Yes, First Love Homestay.

00:30:03.955 --> 00:30:05.472
You can send it in the morning.

00:30:06.085 --> 00:30:07.872
Yes, thank you so much.

00:30:20.625 --> 00:30:21.625
Don’t say it.

00:30:21.955 --> 00:30:23.865
We have to wake up early tomorrow.

00:30:25.145 --> 00:30:26.145
Let’s go to bed.

00:30:29.775 --> 00:30:30.781
Tontharn.

00:30:31.945 --> 00:30:33.094
I’m a man.

00:30:33.137 --> 00:30:34.737
I’m also a man!

00:30:34.774 --> 00:30:36.803
But tomorrow is our homestay’s opening day.

00:30:39.085 --> 00:30:40.337
We need to save our energy.

00:30:41.015 --> 00:30:42.015
Come!

00:30:44.135 --> 00:30:45.135
Hurry up, Tan.

00:30:48.095 --> 00:30:49.095
Tan!

00:30:51.806 --> 00:30:53.486
FIRST LOVE HOMESTAY.

00:30:53.515 --> 00:30:55.181
Congrats, Tontharn.

00:30:55.505 --> 00:30:56.548
Thank you, Doc Jen.

00:30:57.405 --> 00:30:58.405
You too.

00:30:59.145 --> 00:31:01.712
I’m happy you realize what you want to do

00:31:01.763 --> 00:31:03.377
and you’re doing it so well.

00:31:03.965 --> 00:31:05.399
I’m so proud of you, dude.

00:31:06.519 --> 00:31:07.697
I wouldn’thave made it,

00:31:11.715 --> 00:31:12.715
without him.

00:31:14.895 --> 00:31:16.170
So…

00:31:16.665 --> 00:31:18.788
How long are you going to keep
my brother on the hook?

00:31:20.175 --> 00:31:21.175
Right.

00:31:21.455 --> 00:31:23.137
Waiting is torture.

00:31:25.166 --> 00:31:27.135
It’s not him who’s being tortured.

00:31:33.695 --> 00:31:34.975
What are you guys talking about?

00:31:36.975 --> 00:31:38.425
About a sadist

00:31:38.454 --> 00:31:40.039
who likes to torture himself.

00:31:50.345 --> 00:31:52.890
Um, is that Madam Kedsara?

00:32:00.015 --> 00:32:01.015
Grandma.

00:32:02.825 --> 00:32:04.432
I brought you some home fragrances.

00:32:04.468 --> 00:32:06.214
The guests will love the nice smell

00:32:06.388 --> 00:32:07.574
and they’ll keep coming back.

00:32:09.935 --> 00:32:11.508
Thank you so much, Grandma.

00:32:17.115 --> 00:32:19.872
What about Mom Kan?

00:32:21.605 --> 00:32:22.723
Ask her yourself.

00:32:42.025 --> 00:32:43.603
Pleng used to say that.

00:32:44.535 --> 00:32:46.388
I’ve always wanted you to be my mother.

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:48.679
I never thought.

00:32:50.975 --> 00:32:53.297
I would get to become your son as Pleng.

00:32:55.135 --> 00:32:56.926
It was a short time

00:32:58.355 --> 00:33:01.523
that showed me the warmth of a mother
for the first time.

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:11.295
But as Tontharn, who killed Pleng,

00:33:12.985 --> 00:33:15.435
I don’t know if you still want me as a son.

00:33:23.005 --> 00:33:24.294
Tontharn, my son.

00:33:29.905 --> 00:33:32.817
I’ve done what Botpleng asked me to.

00:33:36.225 --> 00:33:38.083
You’re my son, Tontharn.

00:34:05.505 --> 00:34:06.774
Though right now,

00:34:06.815 --> 00:34:08.585
there have been so many new laws,

00:34:09.055 --> 00:34:12.417
we still can’t solve the criminal cases

00:34:12.439 --> 00:34:13.959
that are occurring in the present day.

00:34:19.155 --> 00:34:20.257
Would it be better

00:34:20.279 --> 00:34:22.468
to reduce the issue of crime

00:34:22.505 --> 00:34:24.465
by preventing the occurrence?

00:34:27.365 --> 00:34:28.795
Um, aren’t there organizations

00:34:28.825 --> 00:34:30.795
that are dealing with this?

00:34:30.832 --> 00:34:34.774
Like the ONCB or the Royal Thai Police?

00:34:34.817 --> 00:34:35.399
Yes.

00:34:35.745 --> 00:34:38.088
But they’re more focused on
fixing the problem after it’s occurred,

00:34:38.112 --> 00:34:39.857
rather than preventing them.

00:34:40.805 --> 00:34:44.068
My dream is to build a unit

00:34:44.119 --> 00:34:46.599
that focuses on preventive measures

00:34:46.621 --> 00:34:47.821
rather than capturing.

00:34:47.872 --> 00:34:50.715
Analyzing data to forecast criminal action

00:34:50.745 --> 00:34:52.119
in risky areas.

00:34:52.605 --> 00:34:55.566
In the UK, there’s
the Neighborhood Policing Team

00:34:55.595 --> 00:34:57.952
which focuses on community relationships

00:34:57.988 --> 00:34:59.123
to reduce the crime rate.

00:35:00.335 --> 00:35:01.159
Professor.

00:35:01.203 --> 00:35:04.730
Will our country ever achieve that?

00:35:05.815 --> 00:35:07.261
I will make it happen.

00:35:09.175 --> 00:35:10.585
Starting with small steps

00:35:10.621 --> 00:35:12.294
by teaching you guys

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:14.295
to read a criminal’s body language.

00:35:24.374 --> 00:35:25.374
You know what?

00:35:26.585 --> 00:35:28.388
The name “First Love Homestay”

00:35:29.125 --> 00:35:32.672
came from Botpleng and Thunphob.

00:35:34.054 --> 00:35:35.406
It’s not that hard to figure out.

00:35:36.735 --> 00:35:37.735
What about you?

00:35:38.788 --> 00:35:41.028
You used to say that
looking at this place makes you sad.

00:35:42.515 --> 00:35:43.835
Has that changed?

00:35:45.505 --> 00:35:46.985
I now fall in love when I look at it.

00:35:49.795 --> 00:35:51.690
Thun and Botpleng would be glad.

00:35:52.265 --> 00:35:54.795
That their first love can change this place.

00:35:59.645 --> 00:36:01.268
What about you?

00:36:02.035 --> 00:36:03.283
Aren’t you happy

00:36:04.645 --> 00:36:06.083
that when I look, I feel

00:36:08.055 --> 00:36:09.055
love.

00:36:21.865 --> 00:36:23.210
Did you just

00:36:24.775 --> 00:36:25.879
say you love me?

00:36:27.905 --> 00:36:29.195
Love a dog, maybe!

00:36:29.225 --> 00:36:30.999
I love the one I was looking at.

00:36:34.815 --> 00:36:35.923
Thank you.

00:36:36.345 --> 00:36:37.345
For waiting.

00:36:38.495 --> 00:36:40.890
Thank you for telling me to follow my heart.

00:36:42.095 --> 00:36:43.095
Otherwise,

00:36:44.526 --> 00:36:46.525
I wouldn’t have been this happy.

00:36:50.525 --> 00:36:51.755
I love you, Tan.

00:37:57.185 --> 00:37:58.185
Tontharn.

00:38:06.485 --> 00:38:07.485
Tontharn.

00:38:12.355 --> 00:38:13.355
Tontharn.

00:38:15.935 --> 00:38:16.935
Tontharn.

00:38:23.985 --> 00:38:24.985
Tontharn.

00:38:46.005 --> 00:38:47.261
(Try closing your eyes)

00:38:48.115 --> 00:38:49.952
(and see what you can hear.)

00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:57.588
How should I listen to the leaves
for them to resemble a melody?

00:38:58.439 --> 00:39:00.435
Even the sound of that waterfall is louder.

00:39:01.015 --> 00:39:02.015
A waterfall?

00:39:12.095 --> 00:39:13.175
The sound of the waterfall?

00:39:18.005 --> 00:39:19.005
Tontharn!

00:39:22.435 --> 00:39:24.090
Where are you, Tontharn?

00:40:16.755 --> 00:40:18.083
You once told me

00:40:19.443 --> 00:40:20.817
your name is “Tankhun”

00:40:22.315 --> 00:40:23.995
because you have to return others’ favors.

00:40:24.795 --> 00:40:26.635
But it’s not so.

00:40:35.555 --> 00:40:36.788
Your heart

00:40:38.595 --> 00:40:40.512
is so big and warm

00:40:41.215 --> 00:40:42.883
that no one can ever replace you.

00:40:45.254 --> 00:40:47.255
Every time I call your name,

00:40:48.015 --> 00:40:49.297
I only think that.

00:40:50.272 --> 00:40:52.275
I have to love you even more.

00:40:53.515 --> 00:40:54.708
To return your favor

00:40:57.683 --> 00:40:58.683
of loving me.

00:41:00.485 --> 00:41:01.770
I really thank you

00:41:02.885 --> 00:41:03.885
for loving me.

00:41:05.695 --> 00:41:06.695
Thank you

00:41:07.185 --> 00:41:08.545
for being here for me to love you.

00:41:15.105 --> 00:41:20.679
Daisy, Daisy.

00:41:23.845 --> 00:41:27.479
Give me your answer, do.

00:41:35.265 --> 00:41:37.559
Yes, I do.

00:42:39.875 --> 00:42:40.875
Mom said that

00:42:41.255 --> 00:42:42.855
you have to ask for permission yourself.

00:42:46.905 --> 00:42:48.839
Pleng! Thun!

00:42:50.015 --> 00:42:51.312
Are you guys here?

00:42:52.175 --> 00:42:53.535
This is how you’re going to do it?

00:42:59.275 --> 00:43:01.297
Thun! Botpleng!

00:43:03.595 --> 00:43:05.370
I’m getting married to Tontharn!

00:43:10.845 --> 00:43:11.845
What’s next?

00:43:16.875 --> 00:43:18.875
I don’t know if you guys would mind.

00:43:19.995 --> 00:43:21.555
Even if you do, we’d still get married.

00:43:24.145 --> 00:43:25.145
Tan!

00:43:25.855 --> 00:43:26.855
It’s true.

00:43:27.015 --> 00:43:28.890
I’m just asking out of courtesy.

00:43:30.195 --> 00:43:32.810
Pleng wouldn’t try to stop love.

00:43:33.345 --> 00:43:34.905
He loved seeing people love each other.

00:43:36.375 --> 00:43:37.210
Just like…

00:43:37.254 --> 00:43:39.057
How he wanted Mom Kan love me.

00:43:41.185 --> 00:43:42.679
Thun was also that kind of person.

00:43:43.695 --> 00:43:45.015
He wanted Dad and Mom to love me.

00:43:51.075 --> 00:43:52.366
You guys are so nice.

00:43:56.365 --> 00:43:57.365
By now,

00:43:58.155 --> 00:44:01.246
they’d probably be riding a bike somewhere.

00:44:03.375 --> 00:44:04.599
Just like the two of us.

00:45:25.695 --> 00:45:27.215
Are you thinking of something naughty?

00:45:29.635 --> 00:45:30.635
No.

00:45:31.915 --> 00:45:33.057
I’m just thinking that

00:45:33.525 --> 00:45:34.628
it feels like a dream.

00:45:35.885 --> 00:45:37.414
That this handsome guy

00:45:37.855 --> 00:45:39.210
is becoming mine.

00:45:43.955 --> 00:45:45.559
Tontharn is a lovely kid

00:45:45.895 --> 00:45:48.090
but he always thinks otherwise.

00:45:48.126 --> 00:45:51.683
I used to think I should not love this boy.

00:45:52.895 --> 00:45:55.166
But time proved that

00:45:55.203 --> 00:45:57.165
you deserve to be loved.

00:45:58.405 --> 00:45:59.465
Thank you so much

00:45:59.985 --> 00:46:02.265
for making Khitakan happy

00:46:02.775 --> 00:46:05.006
and for making Botpleng happy, too.

00:46:06.515 --> 00:46:08.926
I hope your love life is filled with happiness.

00:46:09.505 --> 00:46:11.159
My youngest grandson.

00:46:26.265 --> 00:46:27.821
I have wronged you on so many things

00:46:28.785 --> 00:46:30.446
but you said that

00:46:30.483 --> 00:46:34.592
my love made your life better.

00:46:36.148 --> 00:46:38.145
I’ve always wanted to tell you

00:46:39.105 --> 00:46:40.679
that you love

00:46:41.205 --> 00:46:43.035
have saved my life too.

00:46:45.035 --> 00:46:48.337
Without Tontharn becoming my son that day,

00:46:50.215 --> 00:46:52.679
I wouldn’t be here.

00:46:54.635 --> 00:46:57.305
Thank you for forgiving me

00:46:57.952 --> 00:46:59.955
and becoming my son again.

00:47:03.475 --> 00:47:04.679
From now on,

00:47:05.175 --> 00:47:07.799
please take care of my heart, Tankhun.

00:47:10.085 --> 00:47:11.254
My pleasure.

00:47:19.255 --> 00:47:21.255
Ever since I knew you, Tan,

00:47:21.719 --> 00:47:24.075
you’ve never asked for anything from the family.

00:47:24.495 --> 00:47:26.730
You only did what was asked of you.

00:47:27.055 --> 00:47:31.392
Today, I’ll be making just one more wish
on their behalf.

00:47:32.295 --> 00:47:35.806
I wish Tan and Tontharn,

00:47:36.195 --> 00:47:38.461
a love filled with never-ending happiness.

00:47:45.515 --> 00:47:47.268
What about the grooms?

00:47:47.305 --> 00:47:49.265
Do you have anything to say to one another?

00:47:52.785 --> 00:47:56.483
I still remember the first time I saw him.

00:47:59.285 --> 00:48:03.428
His eyes looked confused, like a lost man.

00:48:04.965 --> 00:48:06.294
But he was brave enough

00:48:07.375 --> 00:48:09.217
to find out the truth.

00:48:17.785 --> 00:48:21.508
He’s also kind, attentive,

00:48:22.055 --> 00:48:23.406
and cares for me

00:48:24.765 --> 00:48:26.483
even though he never said it out.

00:48:41.065 --> 00:48:42.643
He loves justice.

00:48:45.075 --> 00:48:46.395
He accepts the truth.

00:48:47.326 --> 00:48:50.235
He can forgive people, truly from his heart.

00:48:51.566 --> 00:48:53.610
I can never forgive myself.

00:48:55.715 --> 00:48:57.457
I don’t even deserve to be here.

00:49:00.325 --> 00:49:01.690
I’ve wronged Thunphob.

00:49:03.985 --> 00:49:05.523
I’ve wronged you, too.

00:49:07.825 --> 00:49:09.137
I am Tontharn.

00:49:10.975 --> 00:49:12.359
I’m not Botpleng.

00:49:15.095 --> 00:49:17.741
The one you love is Botpleng.

00:49:18.345 --> 00:49:19.595
He’s Tontharn,

00:49:21.145 --> 00:49:22.708
who made my heart

00:49:24.625 --> 00:49:26.497
feel like it really comes alive

00:49:27.135 --> 00:49:28.135
for the first time.

00:49:35.625 --> 00:49:37.254
I have already told him

00:49:37.965 --> 00:49:39.697
that no one can ever replace him.

00:49:42.785 --> 00:49:44.483
Every time I’m lost

00:49:45.655 --> 00:49:47.057
or faces darkness,

00:49:49.443 --> 00:49:51.445
there’s always him as my guiding light

00:49:53.555 --> 00:49:54.890
to give me warmth.

00:49:57.355 --> 00:50:00.075
I feel like I’m always embraced by love.

00:50:02.955 --> 00:50:04.883
He’s like the love in a melody

00:50:06.035 --> 00:50:07.777
that goes on endlessly to me.

00:50:34.975 --> 00:50:36.097
Argh!

00:50:40.774 --> 00:50:42.775
They say a wedding is exhausting,

00:50:43.535 --> 00:50:45.021
that’s so true, right, Tan?

00:50:46.606 --> 00:50:48.605
So you’re out of energy

00:50:48.635 --> 00:50:49.915
to make this handsome guy yours?

00:50:52.119 --> 00:50:53.119
Woah!

00:50:56.075 --> 00:50:57.261
My energy is back.

00:51:00.435 --> 00:51:01.741
Just kidding.

00:51:01.785 --> 00:51:03.137
You’ve had a long day.

00:51:03.159 --> 00:51:04.159
Get some rest.

00:51:09.175 --> 00:51:10.175
Hey!

00:51:12.215 --> 00:51:13.530
But I was being serious.

00:51:23.645 --> 00:51:25.406
Become ‘my’ handsome guy.
