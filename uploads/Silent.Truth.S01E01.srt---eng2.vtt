WEBVTT

00:00:15.653 --> 00:00:17.021
Will we find it?

00:00:17.522 --> 00:00:18.490
I'm sure we will.

00:00:18.556 --> 00:00:19.757
-I'm pretty sure.
-It's so fun.

00:00:19.824 --> 00:00:21.693
There's a lot. We've seen them before.

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:22.594
Yeah.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:23.495
We found a lot.

00:00:23.561 --> 00:00:24.429
Yeah, a lot.

00:00:24.496 --> 00:00:26.831
Your bug cage is so small.

00:00:26.898 --> 00:00:27.732
This cage?

00:00:27.799 --> 00:00:29.033
It won't fit in there.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.069
-You think so?
-No worries.

00:00:31.136 --> 00:00:32.937
Just one is enough anyway.

00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:34.005
You're right.

00:00:34.772 --> 00:00:37.208
I don't want it to be too small though.

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:43.948
Just a little farther.

00:00:44.015 --> 00:00:46.017
-Junichi.
-Yeah?

00:00:46.084 --> 00:00:47.418
Let's go this way.

00:00:47.485 --> 00:00:48.319
What?

00:00:48.386 --> 00:00:49.754
-This way?
-Yeah.

00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:51.156
It's closer that way.

00:00:51.222 --> 00:00:52.690
No, this way is closer.

00:00:52.757 --> 00:00:54.759
This way is dangerous.
The other route worked last time.

00:00:54.826 --> 00:00:56.161
Just choose which way is best.

00:00:57.495 --> 00:01:00.198
Let's split into two groups.
Only Keisuke and I know the route.

00:01:00.765 --> 00:01:02.333
Which way do you want to go, Maki?

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.335
‎NO TRESPASSING

00:01:04.402 --> 00:01:05.670
Let's do rock, paper, scissors.

00:01:06.171 --> 00:01:08.973
Rock, paper, scissors.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.175
I'm paper.

00:01:10.241 --> 00:01:11.242
You and me, Naoto.

00:01:11.309 --> 00:01:12.210
All right, let's go!

00:01:12.277 --> 00:01:13.244
What?

00:01:13.311 --> 00:01:14.646
Wait for me.

00:01:14.712 --> 00:01:15.647
-Hurry up, Naoto.
-Wait.

00:01:15.713 --> 00:01:16.881
-Naoto.
-Sorry.

00:01:16.948 --> 00:01:17.849
Naoto.

00:01:18.449 --> 00:01:20.451
What should we do if we meet the culprit?

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:22.487
The one on the run.

00:01:22.554 --> 00:01:24.923
That bank robber, with a gun.

00:01:25.423 --> 00:01:26.491
We won't run into the robber.

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.662
What if, by some chance,
we run into the culprit?

00:01:31.162 --> 00:01:32.130
I'll protect you.

00:01:35.767 --> 00:01:36.868
I see…

00:01:41.105 --> 00:01:42.540
-Are you okay?
-Ouch.

00:01:45.877 --> 00:01:46.811
Thanks.

00:01:52.517 --> 00:01:53.384
Hey.

00:01:53.885 --> 00:01:54.719
Hm?

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.555
Have you kissed anyone before?

00:01:58.623 --> 00:01:59.557
What?

00:02:04.762 --> 00:02:06.931
-Stop!
-Ouch!

00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:09.133
Are you serious?

00:02:11.502 --> 00:02:13.738
It's your fault for fooling around.

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:28.786
What was that?

00:02:30.622 --> 00:02:31.389
What was that--

00:02:57.348 --> 00:02:58.449
That day,

00:03:00.685 --> 00:03:02.954
the four of us committed a crime.

00:03:14.932 --> 00:03:16.367
The crime we committed

00:03:17.268 --> 00:03:20.538
was sealed away in a time capsule
that would never be opened in the future.

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:39.190
It's been 23 years since then.

00:03:39.991 --> 00:03:41.526
I never saw them again.

00:04:12.523 --> 00:04:13.491
Riichi.

00:04:14.058 --> 00:04:15.493
Already?

00:04:18.262 --> 00:04:20.031
MITSUBA POLICE

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.708
Hello, it's Tobina.

00:04:30.775 --> 00:04:32.810
Hey, where are you right now?

00:04:32.877 --> 00:04:34.345
Well, right now I'm…

00:04:34.846 --> 00:04:36.647
Mr. Kamata in Mikoto-cho

00:04:36.714 --> 00:04:39.317
is complaining again,
so could you go and check on him?

00:04:43.488 --> 00:04:45.123
He specifically asked for you.

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:46.357
I'm off duty right now.

00:04:46.424 --> 00:04:48.192
Someone reported you guys to the police.

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:49.093
Shut up.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.027
Hello.

00:04:50.628 --> 00:04:51.963
Hello there.

00:04:53.197 --> 00:04:55.032
-What's going on?
-It's that old man.

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:56.768
This way.

00:04:56.834 --> 00:04:58.002
Try to keep it down.

00:04:58.069 --> 00:04:59.003
Shut up.

00:05:00.338 --> 00:05:02.640
Mr. Kamata. Hello.

00:05:02.707 --> 00:05:04.142
They're so loud.

00:05:04.208 --> 00:05:06.411
-Are you all right?
-Their motorcycle is so loud.

00:05:06.978 --> 00:05:08.546
Why don't you tell me what happened

00:05:09.113 --> 00:05:12.250
-while we play a game of shogi?
-Sounds great.

00:05:12.316 --> 00:05:13.184
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

00:05:13.251 --> 00:05:14.585
Are you serious?

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:17.321
That's insane.

00:05:17.388 --> 00:05:21.058
You were off-duty, but got called in
when it's not even a major incident?

00:05:21.692 --> 00:05:23.528
It just means things are peaceful.

00:05:23.594 --> 00:05:26.230
But still, what if you were on a date,

00:05:26.297 --> 00:05:28.266
or in a situation where you didn't
want to leave?

00:05:30.668 --> 00:05:31.636
You've got a point.

00:05:32.136 --> 00:05:33.738
I was so close to winning a good hand.

00:05:34.238 --> 00:05:35.206
What do you mean?

00:05:36.107 --> 00:05:37.875
Nothing shady, I hope.

00:05:37.942 --> 00:05:39.477
-Hello.
-What are you talking about?

00:05:39.544 --> 00:05:42.713
You've completely blended in,
in the two months you've been here.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:43.815
-Captain.
-Yeah?

00:05:43.881 --> 00:05:45.316
I just sent you my report.

00:05:45.383 --> 00:05:46.517
-Okay.
-Please review it.

00:05:46.584 --> 00:05:48.553
Mr. Tobina, you used to live
in this town, right?

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:50.121
Until sixth grade.

00:05:50.721 --> 00:05:51.556
Really?

00:05:51.622 --> 00:05:53.691
Do you have friends that still live here?

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.962
I haven't seen them at all
since I graduated.

00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:58.863
Really?

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.232
You haven't even
run into them around town?

00:06:02.867 --> 00:06:03.701
Nope.

00:06:03.768 --> 00:06:06.137
You might not notice them
even if you ran into them.

00:06:06.204 --> 00:06:08.039
It's been over 20 years, right?

00:06:08.105 --> 00:06:10.508
-It's been 23 years.
-Wow.

00:06:10.575 --> 00:06:12.109
That's crazy.

00:06:12.176 --> 00:06:14.312
Do you remember the girl
you liked in elementary school?

00:06:17.114 --> 00:06:19.584
Be honest. I don't remember at all.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.319
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:25.690
Stop!

00:06:25.756 --> 00:06:26.724
Ouch.

00:06:27.758 --> 00:06:28.993
Are you serious?

00:06:30.361 --> 00:06:32.597
It's your fault for fooling around.

00:06:33.998 --> 00:06:35.766
-Welcome.
-Hi.

00:06:38.102 --> 00:06:40.304
-Thank you.
-Thank you as always.

00:06:40.371 --> 00:06:41.606
Likewise.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.575
Your hair has gotten longer.

00:06:44.642 --> 00:06:46.143
You think so?

00:06:48.145 --> 00:06:51.215
Masaki got accepted.

00:06:52.383 --> 00:06:53.818
To Hamadai Middle School?

00:06:54.418 --> 00:06:57.588
No way! That's awesome!

00:06:57.655 --> 00:06:59.957
That's great, Maki! Congratulations!

00:07:00.024 --> 00:07:01.926
Clam down, Naoto.

00:07:01.993 --> 00:07:03.427
But it's great news.

00:07:03.494 --> 00:07:06.230
Both you and Masaki worked
so hard for this moment.

00:07:07.598 --> 00:07:08.766
Thank you.

00:07:11.335 --> 00:07:12.537
Speaking of Masaki…

00:07:12.603 --> 00:07:14.405
-Hey there.
-Hello.

00:07:14.472 --> 00:07:15.940
-Can you hold this for me?
-Sure.

00:07:16.941 --> 00:07:17.875
Thank you.

00:07:17.942 --> 00:07:21.479
Congratulations on your acceptance
into Hamadai Middle School.

00:07:21.546 --> 00:07:22.713
Thank you.

00:07:24.782 --> 00:07:25.750
So happy for you.

00:07:25.816 --> 00:07:27.218
There's cake here.

00:07:27.285 --> 00:07:29.220
-Cake?
-Mr. Naoto brought it.

00:07:29.287 --> 00:07:30.888
-Wow.
-Thanks.

00:07:30.955 --> 00:07:32.323
THE DAYS OF MARKING TIME
WILL COME TO AN END

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:33.724
AND A NEW CHAPTER WILL BEGIN

00:07:36.327 --> 00:07:39.163
MAKIKO

00:07:42.967 --> 00:07:43.901
Hello.

00:07:44.569 --> 00:07:45.636
Keisuke?

00:07:46.137 --> 00:07:47.939
When can you come over here?

00:07:48.005 --> 00:07:49.874
Let's see…

00:07:49.941 --> 00:07:51.876
You didn't come back last month either.

00:07:52.743 --> 00:07:53.611
Sorry.

00:07:54.445 --> 00:07:56.814
I'm okay, but I'm thinking about Masaki.

00:07:56.881 --> 00:07:59.617
You did promise to meet him
once a month, after all.

00:07:59.684 --> 00:08:01.752
Sorry, I haven't even had time
to sleep lately.

00:08:01.819 --> 00:08:03.955
I'm still in the office as we speak.

00:08:04.021 --> 00:08:05.389
I see.

00:08:06.891 --> 00:08:08.092
Well, try to take it easy.

00:08:08.593 --> 00:08:11.028
Instead of taking an hour and a half
to come here,

00:08:11.095 --> 00:08:12.630
I'd rather have you get some rest.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.132
I'll go there once things
settle down here.

00:08:15.199 --> 00:08:17.401
I want to celebrate Masaki's
school acceptance too.

00:08:18.202 --> 00:08:19.036
Yeah.

00:08:19.604 --> 00:08:20.438
Later.

00:08:20.938 --> 00:08:22.506
Bye.

00:08:30.514 --> 00:08:31.916
Nice, Junichi.

00:08:33.117 --> 00:08:34.585
Very nice.

00:08:36.387 --> 00:08:37.521
Good job, Maki.

00:08:39.023 --> 00:08:40.658
Good job, Naoto. Go.

00:08:41.392 --> 00:08:42.827
Very good.

00:08:45.029 --> 00:08:46.731
Meditation!

00:08:58.676 --> 00:09:01.245
SMILE SAKUMA

00:09:22.099 --> 00:09:24.602
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:09:24.669 --> 00:09:27.104
-I'll come again.
-We'll be waiting.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.608
Hello, this is Ma saison.

00:09:31.842 --> 00:09:33.711
Where is Makiko Iwamoto?

00:09:34.612 --> 00:09:35.446
Is she there?

00:09:36.047 --> 00:09:37.882
She's with a client right now.

00:09:37.948 --> 00:09:40.518
If you'd like to make an appointment,
I can do that for you.

00:09:42.019 --> 00:09:43.688
Makiko Iwamoto.

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:47.858
Manager.

00:09:47.925 --> 00:09:48.759
Yeah.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.127
Um…

00:09:50.194 --> 00:09:52.430
The caller keeps repeating,
"Makiko Iwamoto."

00:09:57.001 --> 00:10:00.071
Hello, this is the manager,
Iwamoto, speaking.

00:10:03.107 --> 00:10:04.742
Long time no see.

00:10:05.776 --> 00:10:07.178
It's Sakuma.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.550
-Excuse me, but…
-Can you come here right away?

00:10:14.552 --> 00:10:16.420
To Smile Sakuma.

00:10:17.321 --> 00:10:18.155
What?

00:10:20.324 --> 00:10:21.192
Um…

00:10:22.626 --> 00:10:24.061
Do you finally remember

00:10:24.962 --> 00:10:26.297
who I am?

00:10:34.572 --> 00:10:37.108
I'm not sure what this is regarding,

00:10:37.174 --> 00:10:39.243
but I'm currently assisting
another client.

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:41.612
His name is Masaki, huh?

00:10:43.314 --> 00:10:44.782
Your son, I mean.

00:10:47.551 --> 00:10:49.253
Why do you know about Masaki?

00:10:50.354 --> 00:10:51.789
Your son

00:10:53.591 --> 00:10:56.794
shoplifted from my store.

00:11:12.743 --> 00:11:14.145
NAOTO

00:11:18.449 --> 00:11:21.385
The person you have called
cannot answer the phone right now.

00:11:32.997 --> 00:11:39.170
SMILE SAKUMA

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.675
Ms. Iwamoto!

00:11:44.742 --> 00:11:45.643
Hello.

00:11:45.709 --> 00:11:47.711
It's unusual to see you here
at this time of the day.

00:11:47.778 --> 00:11:48.646
Is your shop closed?

00:11:48.712 --> 00:11:50.114
No, it's open today.

00:11:50.181 --> 00:11:52.049
I see. You know,

00:11:52.116 --> 00:11:54.885
it's taking so long
for my bangs to grow out.

00:11:54.952 --> 00:11:58.455
But there's an event coming up
so I'm trying to grow them out.

00:11:58.522 --> 00:11:59.490
Please do my hair again.

00:11:59.557 --> 00:12:01.425
Of course, any time.

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:14.305
Do you finally remember

00:12:15.072 --> 00:12:16.173
who I am?

00:13:18.502 --> 00:13:22.106
Sorry for taking you away from work.

00:13:22.907 --> 00:13:26.911
I sincerely apologize for the trouble
my son has caused.

00:13:35.486 --> 00:13:36.487
Come inside.

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:40.925
Where's my son?

00:13:42.059 --> 00:13:44.295
I have him waiting somewhere else.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.370
We can't let him overhear
the conversation between adults, right?

00:13:56.874 --> 00:13:58.108
Don't worry.

00:13:59.476 --> 00:14:02.713
This is my personal office.

00:14:19.663 --> 00:14:20.664
This thing

00:14:21.699 --> 00:14:23.300
is 330 yen.

00:14:24.668 --> 00:14:26.403
I'm very sorry.

00:14:28.472 --> 00:14:30.441
He's still just a kid.

00:14:31.275 --> 00:14:32.776
There's no need to make a big fuss

00:14:32.843 --> 00:14:35.079
over something as minor as shoplifting.

00:14:36.847 --> 00:14:39.316
Some people might think like that,

00:14:40.351 --> 00:14:42.720
but shoplifting is still a serious crime.

00:14:44.555 --> 00:14:46.657
Besides, I'm the store manager here.

00:14:47.791 --> 00:14:49.426
I have a certain position to uphold.

00:15:03.273 --> 00:15:06.443
I can refrain
from reporting this to the police.

00:15:07.211 --> 00:15:09.046
I'll even give you this video footage.

00:15:11.048 --> 00:15:12.216
That is,

00:15:13.984 --> 00:15:16.186
if you show me your sincerity.

00:15:20.157 --> 00:15:21.158
Sincerity?

00:15:22.192 --> 00:15:23.727
Okay. Roger.

00:15:24.228 --> 00:15:26.597
There was a report of a break-in
at a residence.

00:15:26.663 --> 00:15:28.532
The culprit is still at the scene.

00:15:28.599 --> 00:15:29.767
Tobina…

00:15:29.833 --> 00:15:30.701
and…

00:15:31.201 --> 00:15:32.236
Nagai.

00:15:32.302 --> 00:15:33.370
Head to the scene.

00:15:33.437 --> 00:15:34.371
Awesome!

00:15:34.438 --> 00:15:35.339
Yes!

00:15:36.573 --> 00:15:38.642
It's been a while
since we dealt with a culprit!

00:15:39.143 --> 00:15:41.178
Mr. Tobina, I'll bring the car around!

00:15:41.245 --> 00:15:42.813
Mitsuko.

00:15:43.547 --> 00:15:44.948
Mitsuko!

00:15:46.283 --> 00:15:48.986
Who needs those useless wings?

00:15:49.053 --> 00:15:51.355
He's a complete stranger.

00:15:51.422 --> 00:15:54.491
When I came home, he was watching TV
like he owned the place.

00:15:55.726 --> 00:15:57.094
Who's that on the bed?

00:15:57.161 --> 00:15:58.662
My mom!

00:16:00.898 --> 00:16:02.733
-I'll go inside.
-Okay.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.068
Hey dear,

00:16:04.635 --> 00:16:06.437
next time he forgets something,

00:16:06.503 --> 00:16:07.905
let's not take it to him anymore.

00:16:07.971 --> 00:16:10.174
It won't do any good.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.141
Nagai.

00:16:11.208 --> 00:16:12.443
Yes.

00:16:13.577 --> 00:16:14.611
Hello.

00:16:14.678 --> 00:16:16.713
"Mr. Yoshihiko Nakamura."

00:16:17.214 --> 00:16:19.016
"Specialized Nursing Home."

00:16:19.083 --> 00:16:20.818
"Chitose-en, Irohadai."

00:16:21.618 --> 00:16:23.320
Hello, Mr. Nakamura.

00:16:23.387 --> 00:16:24.855
Hello.

00:16:24.922 --> 00:16:27.925
OPPOSE THE CONSTRUCTION
OF THE SHOPPING MALL!

00:16:28.725 --> 00:16:30.360
-Nagai.
-Yeah?

00:16:31.028 --> 00:16:32.329
What's that?

00:16:33.163 --> 00:16:34.731
It's an elementary school
that closed down.

00:16:36.033 --> 00:16:37.267
That's where I went.

00:16:37.334 --> 00:16:39.870
Seriously? That's crazy.

00:16:41.572 --> 00:16:43.107
There're plans for a building complex,

00:16:43.173 --> 00:16:45.943
and the residents are staging
a protest against it.

00:16:46.009 --> 00:16:47.211
A building complex?

00:16:47.277 --> 00:16:50.247
A community center
and a large-scale shopping mall.

00:16:50.914 --> 00:16:53.884
It will be built by Mitsuba City
and Sakuma Land Development.

00:16:53.951 --> 00:16:55.419
Sakuma is a big name around here.

00:16:55.486 --> 00:16:57.688
They run the supermarket Smile Sakuma.

00:17:09.933 --> 00:17:11.301
That guy just now…

00:17:12.136 --> 00:17:13.303
the manager of this store,

00:17:14.238 --> 00:17:16.106
is Naoto's older brother.

00:17:17.841 --> 00:17:19.843
He decided to let us go this time.

00:17:22.145 --> 00:17:23.680
But promise me

00:17:24.882 --> 00:17:26.550
that you'll never do this again.

00:17:29.653 --> 00:17:31.121
Do you understand what you've done?

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:34.825
I'm sorry.

00:17:59.917 --> 00:18:01.084
It's okay.

00:18:06.056 --> 00:18:07.357
It's okay now.

00:18:38.055 --> 00:18:40.424
Thank you for coming all the way here.

00:18:41.391 --> 00:18:42.326
How's Masaki?

00:18:42.826 --> 00:18:44.528
He's in bed already.

00:18:52.536 --> 00:18:54.204
Did you get in touch with Naoto?

00:18:54.938 --> 00:18:55.906
No.

00:18:56.506 --> 00:18:59.409
I think he'll contact me
once he reads my message.

00:19:03.247 --> 00:19:06.216
You're meeting up with him tonight
at 11:00 p.m., right?

00:19:06.283 --> 00:19:07.117
Yeah.

00:19:10.387 --> 00:19:11.221
Hey,

00:19:12.456 --> 00:19:14.291
are you seriously going to comply
with his demand?

00:19:14.791 --> 00:19:16.593
There's no other option.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.996
Do you think someone
who's demanding 300,000 yen

00:19:19.062 --> 00:19:20.831
will stop with just this once?

00:19:21.398 --> 00:19:23.467
He's going to give me
the security video footage.

00:19:23.533 --> 00:19:25.269
He can make copies of that.

00:19:25.335 --> 00:19:26.970
Then what do you suggest we do?

00:19:27.037 --> 00:19:30.140
He says he'll report our son to the police
if we don't pay him 300,000 yen.

00:19:30.641 --> 00:19:32.709
Even if Masaki is reported
for shoplifting,

00:19:32.776 --> 00:19:34.244
the police can't do anything about it.

00:19:34.311 --> 00:19:37.347
He's only 12 years old.

00:19:37.414 --> 00:19:38.815
What if his school finds out?

00:19:39.716 --> 00:19:42.486
Can you guarantee that his admission
to middle school won't be revoked?

00:19:42.552 --> 00:19:44.588
Well…

00:19:45.656 --> 00:19:48.625
I guess there's a chance
of that getting revoked.

00:19:48.692 --> 00:19:50.360
There are tons of other middle schools.

00:19:50.427 --> 00:19:52.663
It's not that simple.

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:55.265
You don't get it, Keisuke.

00:19:56.667 --> 00:19:58.769
Do you have any idea how much I struggled

00:19:58.835 --> 00:20:00.904
to secure that highly recommended school?

00:20:04.041 --> 00:20:05.075
Either way,

00:20:07.244 --> 00:20:09.112
there's no other choice
but to buy his silence.

00:20:13.383 --> 00:20:16.286
If that's what you want,
then I'll pay the 300,000--

00:20:16.353 --> 00:20:17.354
It's okay.

00:20:18.355 --> 00:20:20.791
I already went to the bank
and withdrew the money.

00:20:23.393 --> 00:20:24.628
I'll go with you.

00:20:25.128 --> 00:20:27.331
-What?
-I'll talk to him.

00:20:27.831 --> 00:20:29.833
I'll make him sign a written agreement.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.968
If he accepts the money,
it will be considered extortion.

00:20:32.035 --> 00:20:34.571
He's the one who will be in trouble
if the police get involved.

00:20:38.475 --> 00:20:39.543
Okay.

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:41.745
Thank you.

00:20:48.185 --> 00:20:49.286
Masaki.

00:20:51.455 --> 00:20:52.422
I'm coming in.

00:21:34.131 --> 00:21:35.665
I'm Masaki's father.

00:21:37.667 --> 00:21:40.137
You didn't come alone.

00:21:42.539 --> 00:21:43.640
Where's the money?

00:21:44.141 --> 00:21:45.475
Let's talk first.

00:21:45.542 --> 00:21:47.411
No, hand me the money first.

00:21:47.911 --> 00:21:50.414
Unless you want me to cancel this deal.

00:22:14.004 --> 00:22:15.305
Whoa.

00:22:16.873 --> 00:22:17.707
Wow.

00:22:18.675 --> 00:22:20.577
I want written confirmation
of this exchange,

00:22:20.644 --> 00:22:23.046
-and hand over the security footage.
-Now, now,

00:22:23.113 --> 00:22:24.815
just slow down.

00:22:29.753 --> 00:22:32.355
Let's have a chat. Man to man.

00:22:40.363 --> 00:22:43.600
SMILE SAKUMA

00:22:43.667 --> 00:22:44.668
NAOTO SAKUMA

00:22:44.734 --> 00:22:46.136
SORRY FOR THE SUDDEN CALL

00:22:46.203 --> 00:22:47.671
ARE YOU BUSY? CAN WE TALK?

00:22:47.737 --> 00:22:49.072
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

00:22:49.139 --> 00:22:51.041
MASAKI SHOPLIFTED
FROM YOUR BROTHER'S SHOP.

00:22:54.478 --> 00:22:55.378
How was it?

00:22:55.879 --> 00:22:57.347
Sorry.

00:22:57.414 --> 00:22:58.248
What?

00:22:58.315 --> 00:23:00.784
Just as I thought, he won't end things
with 300,000 yen,

00:23:00.851 --> 00:23:02.786
and he didn't give me the footage either.

00:23:05.088 --> 00:23:07.123
He said if we don't
do as he says tomorrow,

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:08.758
he'll report it to Masaki's school.

00:23:09.259 --> 00:23:12.062
We shouldn't let him manipulate us
any further.

00:23:16.633 --> 00:23:18.401
What is he asking for now?

00:23:50.166 --> 00:23:54.671
JANUARY 17TH

00:24:00.844 --> 00:24:01.912
What time is it?

00:24:03.613 --> 00:24:05.382
It's past seven.

00:24:06.283 --> 00:24:07.617
Your night shift finally ended?

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.187
I'm so sleepy.

00:24:12.355 --> 00:24:14.257
It's tough working as a nurse.

00:24:15.559 --> 00:24:17.527
I can fall asleep in ten seconds.

00:24:22.365 --> 00:24:24.134
Good night.

00:24:28.138 --> 00:24:30.040
-You're leaving already?
-Yeah.

00:24:32.042 --> 00:24:33.743
Being a detective is tough too, huh?

00:24:34.911 --> 00:24:36.980
-Bye.
-I'll be off.

00:24:47.991 --> 00:24:50.827
I messaged Naoto and left a voicemail too.

00:24:51.328 --> 00:24:52.796
But he hasn't contacted me yet.

00:24:54.564 --> 00:24:56.766
I called Naoto's workplace.

00:24:57.367 --> 00:24:59.069
Sakuma Land Development?

00:24:59.135 --> 00:25:00.170
Yeah.

00:25:00.236 --> 00:25:02.739
Our design team is handling
Naoto's project,

00:25:02.806 --> 00:25:04.641
and I'm involved as an architect.

00:25:04.708 --> 00:25:06.743
The huge supermarket
that's going to be built

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:08.144
on the old school site?

00:25:08.211 --> 00:25:09.079
Yeah, that one.

00:25:09.579 --> 00:25:12.515
What? You're part of that project?

00:25:13.016 --> 00:25:15.352
Naoto didn't mention it at all.

00:25:16.786 --> 00:25:18.355
And what happened when you called?

00:25:19.089 --> 00:25:20.657
He's on a business trip to Korea

00:25:20.724 --> 00:25:23.393
and will be returning to Haneda
before 9:00 p.m. tonight.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.629
Before 9:00 p.m., okay.

00:25:27.631 --> 00:25:28.465
Hey.

00:25:28.965 --> 00:25:30.533
You're really doing this?

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:32.936
Yes, I'm going to comply with his demand.

00:25:34.204 --> 00:25:36.072
I'm going to protect Masaki
no matter what.

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.547
Okay.

00:25:45.181 --> 00:25:47.050
We're meeting him at 11:00 p.m., right?

00:25:48.084 --> 00:25:50.253
I'll go check-in at the hotel once.
I want to shower too.

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.222
You're not returning to Tokyo today?

00:25:52.288 --> 00:25:53.690
I'm staying here tonight.

00:25:55.258 --> 00:25:56.893
You can stay at my place.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.428
Oh…

00:25:58.495 --> 00:25:59.829
well, um…

00:26:00.563 --> 00:26:02.966
I can expense it anyway.

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:05.301
Then

00:26:05.869 --> 00:26:07.437
I'll go back to my shop.

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.315
You should at least come over for dinner.

00:26:19.382 --> 00:26:20.250
Oh…

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:23.653
I bet you're eating unhealthy things
since you're on your own.

00:26:24.854 --> 00:26:27.891
It's been a while,
so let's have a meal with Masaki.

00:26:45.408 --> 00:26:46.342
Hey.

00:26:46.409 --> 00:26:48.745
I have a lot of work to do today,
so I'll be staying overnight.

00:26:49.746 --> 00:26:50.613
Okay.

00:26:51.548 --> 00:26:53.683
How are you feeling? Still doing okay?

00:26:55.919 --> 00:26:56.786
I'm okay.

00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:58.588
What about you, Keisuke?

00:26:59.823 --> 00:27:01.691
I'm okay.

00:27:01.758 --> 00:27:03.526
Call me if you need me.

00:27:04.494 --> 00:27:05.328
Bye.

00:27:14.704 --> 00:27:16.706
Yes, thank you. Goodbye.

00:27:32.922 --> 00:27:35.091
This is where it was all along?

00:27:37.827 --> 00:27:38.661
I'm sorry,

00:27:39.362 --> 00:27:40.997
but I need to talk to you about something.

00:27:42.165 --> 00:27:45.101
Masaki shoplifted
from your older brother's supermarket.

00:27:53.843 --> 00:27:54.778
I'll be off.

00:27:56.446 --> 00:27:58.481
I think I should go too--

00:27:58.548 --> 00:27:59.749
You shouldn't come.

00:28:05.989 --> 00:28:12.395
SMILE SAKUMA

00:28:30.346 --> 00:28:32.081
Good morning.

00:28:32.715 --> 00:28:35.218
I'm going to begin the morning Smile Sale.

00:28:35.285 --> 00:28:37.453
Manager, I'm taking the key.

00:28:38.721 --> 00:28:39.856
You're not here?

00:28:43.026 --> 00:28:44.561
IGAWA

00:28:44.627 --> 00:28:45.728
Manager.

00:29:16.192 --> 00:29:18.561
Chief, good morning.

00:29:19.329 --> 00:29:20.296
Good morning!

00:29:21.431 --> 00:29:22.899
The murdered victim

00:29:23.399 --> 00:29:25.668
is said to be the son
of the Sakuma Land Development Company.

00:29:25.735 --> 00:29:27.670
The oldest son, not the second son.

00:29:27.737 --> 00:29:28.571
-Okay.
-No way.

00:29:29.539 --> 00:29:30.673
It's a big case.

00:29:31.174 --> 00:29:33.943
The Prefectural Police's First Division
will be coming and setting up.

00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:36.646
But it's under our jurisdiction.

00:29:36.713 --> 00:29:37.981
Please do your best.

00:29:38.047 --> 00:29:38.882
Yes, sir!

00:29:38.948 --> 00:29:40.550
Yes, sir.

00:29:40.617 --> 00:29:42.752
-Let's go.
-We'll be off.

00:29:42.819 --> 00:29:45.054
VICTIM

00:29:45.121 --> 00:29:49.025
Captain, your handwriting is insane.

00:29:49.092 --> 00:29:51.895
Maybe you should have someone else
do the writing.

00:29:51.961 --> 00:29:55.765
I'm the one who's going to write
on this board! Shut your mouth!

00:29:55.832 --> 00:29:57.300
Heave-ho.

00:29:57.367 --> 00:29:58.701
Thanks.

00:30:00.036 --> 00:30:01.437
Captain is fired up.

00:30:02.238 --> 00:30:04.407
It's been decades since we've had
a murder case like this.

00:30:04.974 --> 00:30:06.943
I never thought we'd have
a command center set up here.

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:08.044
You seem happy.

00:30:08.978 --> 00:30:10.380
I'm nervous

00:30:10.446 --> 00:30:12.615
to be paired up with a detective
from the First Division.

00:30:12.682 --> 00:30:13.516
Let's do this.

00:30:39.008 --> 00:30:42.612
MURDER INVESTIGATION OF
THE NISHIMATSU-CHO SUPERMARKET MANAGER

00:30:42.679 --> 00:30:44.314
I'm the captain
of Kanagawa First Division.

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:45.214
My name is Shirakawa.

00:30:45.281 --> 00:30:47.550
I'm Kosugi,
the chief of Mitsuba Police Station.

00:30:47.617 --> 00:30:49.519
I will be heading this investigation.

00:31:12.508 --> 00:31:15.278
The victim has been identified
as Hideyuki Sakuma, 40 years old.

00:31:15.345 --> 00:31:18.214
The manager of Smile Sakuma
in Mitsuba Minami.

00:31:18.281 --> 00:31:20.883
The crime scene was the manager's office
on the store premises.

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:23.152
It was a space
used exclusively by the victim.

00:31:23.219 --> 00:31:24.921
The body was first discovered

00:31:24.988 --> 00:31:26.456
by a supermarket employee.

00:31:26.522 --> 00:31:29.292
Shortly after 9:00 a.m., the employee
went to the manager's office

00:31:29.359 --> 00:31:32.095
to borrow the key to the safe
and discovered the body there.

00:31:32.161 --> 00:31:34.664
It appears he was shot
and killed with a handgun,

00:31:34.731 --> 00:31:36.632
but the weapon has not yet been found.

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:40.603
The Sakuma family is known as one of
the most prominent families in the area.

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:43.006
The current head of the family,
and the father

00:31:43.072 --> 00:31:44.540
of the victim, Hideyuki,

00:31:44.607 --> 00:31:47.010
is Hidemasa Sakuma,
and he is currently hospitalized.

00:31:47.076 --> 00:31:48.011
Last year,

00:31:48.077 --> 00:31:51.814
he suffered a stroke
and hasn't been discharged yet.

00:31:52.382 --> 00:31:55.785
It is said that the family business
is effectively being run

00:31:55.852 --> 00:31:58.187
by his second son, Naoto Sakuma,

00:31:58.254 --> 00:32:00.723
who is the managing director
of Sakuma Land Development.

00:32:01.591 --> 00:32:03.459
What was the victim doing
the day he was killed?

00:32:03.526 --> 00:32:04.794
Tobina.

00:32:04.861 --> 00:32:07.663
Tobina, your partner will be Ms. Nara.

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:08.965
Apparently,

00:32:09.032 --> 00:32:12.735
she's the odd one out
in the prefectural police force.

00:32:13.603 --> 00:32:16.906
-Your voice is so loud. Shush.
-Yes, sir.

00:32:16.973 --> 00:32:20.043
Nagai, you team up with Mr. Murakami.

00:32:20.109 --> 00:32:21.544
The one who's talking right now.

00:32:21.611 --> 00:32:24.547
Understood.

00:32:25.848 --> 00:32:27.517
-Sasakura is…
-Shush.

00:32:36.059 --> 00:32:38.061
We are from
the Kanagawa Prefectural Police.

00:32:39.228 --> 00:32:41.664
We have come to speak
with the Sakuma family.

00:32:56.913 --> 00:32:59.015
Hey Junichi, what are you doing?

00:32:59.082 --> 00:33:00.783
Stop that.

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:01.751
What're you doing?

00:33:01.818 --> 00:33:03.052
Keisuke, come and join me.

00:33:03.119 --> 00:33:05.254
-There's a branch right there.
-I'm not doing that.

00:33:05.321 --> 00:33:06.689
One costs tens of thousands.

00:33:06.756 --> 00:33:08.958
Liar. He's lying, right Naoto?

00:33:09.859 --> 00:33:11.094
What are you guys doing?

00:33:11.594 --> 00:33:12.795
Naoto!

00:33:16.065 --> 00:33:16.999
We're sorry!

00:33:26.809 --> 00:33:28.211
I'm Hideyuki's younger brother.

00:33:28.277 --> 00:33:29.745
My name is Naoto Sakuma.

00:33:29.812 --> 00:33:31.013
I'm Nara.

00:33:31.881 --> 00:33:32.949
I'm Tobina.

00:33:36.219 --> 00:33:37.253
Junichi?

00:33:40.723 --> 00:33:42.725
He was my classmate in elementary school.

00:33:42.792 --> 00:33:44.160
I see.

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.329
I haven't seen him since graduation,

00:33:46.395 --> 00:33:48.131
so it won't interfere
with the investigation.

00:33:49.432 --> 00:33:50.700
‎I see.

00:33:56.939 --> 00:34:00.109
Oh my, you've become a fine young man!

00:34:00.176 --> 00:34:01.777
You're a detective now?

00:34:01.844 --> 00:34:03.379
Long time no see.

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.448
I'm sorry,

00:34:05.515 --> 00:34:07.717
but my mother isn't feeling well.

00:34:08.284 --> 00:34:10.019
Then please take a rest.

00:34:10.086 --> 00:34:13.990
Perhaps we can talk with you another day.

00:34:14.056 --> 00:34:16.792
Then I will excuse myself.

00:34:17.927 --> 00:34:20.496
Junichi, please come

00:34:20.563 --> 00:34:22.698
-visit again when you have more time.
-Yes.

00:34:22.765 --> 00:34:25.067
I'll welcome you
with freshly-baked madeleines.

00:34:25.134 --> 00:34:26.769
Thank you.

00:34:26.836 --> 00:34:27.837
Goodbye.

00:34:37.213 --> 00:34:39.148
Sorry to interrupt this nice reunion,

00:34:39.215 --> 00:34:41.584
but we need to ask you about your brother.

00:34:41.651 --> 00:34:42.485
Of course.

00:34:43.319 --> 00:34:45.755
Your older brother lived here, right?

00:34:46.255 --> 00:34:50.693
He came back two months ago and lived
in that detached house.

00:34:51.861 --> 00:34:54.030
He wasn't living
in this spacious main house?

00:34:55.164 --> 00:34:57.033
It's been like that ever since
we were kids.

00:34:58.134 --> 00:35:00.970
Your brother was the son
of your dad's previous wife, right?

00:35:02.238 --> 00:35:03.139
Yes.

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.641
After they divorced,

00:35:06.375 --> 00:35:10.146
she lived with my brother for a few years,

00:35:10.213 --> 00:35:13.950
but then she left him
and went off somewhere.

00:35:14.016 --> 00:35:16.185
So my brother came to live here.

00:35:16.252 --> 00:35:18.721
Where was your brother before he came here
two months ago?

00:35:18.788 --> 00:35:19.855
In Tokyo.

00:35:19.922 --> 00:35:21.591
Were you in contact with him?

00:35:22.391 --> 00:35:24.260
We hardly kept in touch,

00:35:25.161 --> 00:35:27.230
and I didn't even know
where he was living.

00:35:28.164 --> 00:35:30.199
Once in a while he would contact me,

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:33.269
only to ask me to send him money
or something like that.

00:35:33.769 --> 00:35:36.439
Do you know anyone who had
a grudge against your brother?

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:40.776
I don't know anything about my brother's
social circle.

00:35:42.378 --> 00:35:43.379
But…

00:35:46.549 --> 00:35:47.850
recently,

00:35:48.584 --> 00:35:50.052
our company

00:35:51.554 --> 00:35:52.989
has been receiving threats.

00:35:53.055 --> 00:35:54.156
Threats?

00:35:54.924 --> 00:35:56.826
That's troublesome.

00:35:58.594 --> 00:36:00.563
It said that if we proceed

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:03.199
with the construction
of the building complex that our company

00:36:03.266 --> 00:36:04.100
is planning,

00:36:04.166 --> 00:36:05.801
divine punishment will befall us.

00:36:05.868 --> 00:36:06.702
OPPOSE THE CONSTRUCTION
OF THE SHOPPING MALL!

00:36:06.769 --> 00:36:08.504
What's this building complex?

00:36:08.571 --> 00:36:10.273
We plan to collaborate with the city

00:36:10.339 --> 00:36:12.074
to build a facility

00:36:12.141 --> 00:36:14.844
that combines a community center
and a shopping mall.

00:36:15.811 --> 00:36:19.115
I believe the person who sent the threat

00:36:19.181 --> 00:36:22.385
is a local retailer who opposes
the construction.

00:36:22.451 --> 00:36:25.855
If possible, we'd like to see
that letter containing the threat.

00:36:25.921 --> 00:36:27.323
I'm sorry.

00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:29.558
We received two threatening letters,

00:36:29.625 --> 00:36:32.695
but we threw both of them away.

00:36:33.963 --> 00:36:35.064
By the way,

00:36:35.831 --> 00:36:37.466
regarding last night…

00:36:38.034 --> 00:36:40.436
Where were you, Mr. Naoto?

00:36:41.237 --> 00:36:44.173
I returned from my business trip to Korea.

00:36:46.008 --> 00:36:49.945
I arrived at Haneda Airport
just before 9:00 p.m.

00:36:50.446 --> 00:36:52.982
It usually takes about an hour
to get here by car,

00:36:53.482 --> 00:36:55.685
but I got caught in traffic,

00:36:56.519 --> 00:36:58.254
so I think I didn't get home

00:36:58.321 --> 00:37:02.024
until a little before 11:00 p.m.

00:37:02.091 --> 00:37:04.093
Could you tell me which flight
you were on?

00:37:04.727 --> 00:37:05.661
Yes.

00:37:06.195 --> 00:37:07.663
Please wait one moment.

00:37:12.201 --> 00:37:13.235
It seems like

00:37:13.302 --> 00:37:16.105
his older brother
was quite a troublemaker.

00:37:17.373 --> 00:37:21.644
The families of victims usually exude
a palpable sense of grief,

00:37:22.478 --> 00:37:24.380
but there was no such feeling present.

00:37:28.384 --> 00:37:30.619
The owner of a hardware store
located next to

00:37:30.686 --> 00:37:33.489
the scene of the crime,
said he heard what sounded like gunshots.

00:37:33.989 --> 00:37:36.225
He stated that he heard them
shortly before 10:00 p.m.

00:37:36.292 --> 00:37:38.961
Based on the reports from forensic experts
regarding the rigor mortis,

00:37:39.028 --> 00:37:41.564
it's safe to conclude
that the victim was shot

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:42.765
shortly before 10:00 p.m.

00:37:44.066 --> 00:37:44.900
Sir.

00:37:45.401 --> 00:37:47.670
We contacted the victim's family,

00:37:47.737 --> 00:37:49.805
but they have no idea
who the perpetrator might be.

00:37:49.872 --> 00:37:52.141
However, it appears
that the victim's half-brother,

00:37:52.208 --> 00:37:54.710
Naoto Sakuma,
had recently been receiving threats.

00:37:55.811 --> 00:37:56.746
Sir.

00:37:57.947 --> 00:37:58.948
Mr. Sakuma is currently

00:37:59.014 --> 00:38:01.984
working on a project
to build a large complex, and it appears

00:38:02.051 --> 00:38:05.454
he has been subjected to harassment
by retailers opposed to the development.

00:38:05.521 --> 00:38:07.356
It is unclear whether it's related
to this case.

00:38:07.423 --> 00:38:08.557
Sir.

00:38:08.624 --> 00:38:11.894
We have new testimony from the employee
who was the first to discover the body.

00:38:11.961 --> 00:38:12.962
The day before the incident,

00:38:13.028 --> 00:38:15.097
an acquaintance, a hairdresser,

00:38:15.164 --> 00:38:17.366
reportedly came to the supermarket,
but not to shop.

00:38:17.433 --> 00:38:19.168
She apparently left with her son.

00:38:19.902 --> 00:38:21.971
This was unusual because this hairdresser

00:38:22.037 --> 00:38:25.641
used to frequent the store,
but hadn't been seen there recently.

00:38:25.708 --> 00:38:28.911
Therefore, we asked the hairdresser
to come to the station tomorrow.

00:38:28.978 --> 00:38:31.180
She's the manager
of the hair salon, Ma saison.

00:38:31.247 --> 00:38:32.815
Ms. Makiko Iwamoto.

00:38:33.749 --> 00:38:36.952
The first name is Makiko,

00:38:37.019 --> 00:38:41.490
and the last name is Iwamoto.

00:38:41.557 --> 00:38:42.892
Ms. Makiko Iwamoto.

00:38:44.193 --> 00:38:45.094
Roger.

00:38:46.195 --> 00:38:47.963
Regarding the bullet…

00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:49.398
Is something the matter?

00:38:50.299 --> 00:38:52.334
I had a classmate with that same name.

00:38:53.068 --> 00:38:54.703
Oh my…

00:39:00.209 --> 00:39:01.777
-You have everything?
-Yeah.

00:39:01.844 --> 00:39:02.745
Bye.

00:39:02.812 --> 00:39:04.713
Run, run.

00:39:05.948 --> 00:39:07.483
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:39:27.503 --> 00:39:29.071
Following Mr. Naoto Sakuma,

00:39:29.138 --> 00:39:31.674
this would be reunion number two, huh?

00:39:44.386 --> 00:39:45.654
Thank you for waiting.

00:39:45.721 --> 00:39:46.555
I'm Nara.

00:39:52.761 --> 00:39:54.129
I'm Tobina.

00:39:57.166 --> 00:39:58.400
Thank you

00:39:58.467 --> 00:40:01.170
for taking time out of your busy schedule
for us.

00:40:01.237 --> 00:40:02.705
Let's get straight to the point.

00:40:02.771 --> 00:40:04.907
We'd like to ask you some questions.

00:40:04.974 --> 00:40:06.075
Okay.

00:40:06.141 --> 00:40:07.843
The manager of Smile Sakuma,

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:11.046
Hideyuki Sakuma, was murdered.

00:40:11.113 --> 00:40:12.014
Are you aware of that?

00:40:12.915 --> 00:40:15.784
Yes, I saw it on the news.

00:40:15.851 --> 00:40:17.486
On Friday evening,

00:40:17.553 --> 00:40:20.689
you went to Smile Sakuma, right?

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:22.224
Yes.

00:40:22.291 --> 00:40:23.859
What did you go there for?

00:40:24.994 --> 00:40:29.198
My son called me to say
he had lost his wallet,

00:40:29.265 --> 00:40:30.900
so I went to give him some money.

00:40:30.966 --> 00:40:32.768
You have a son?

00:40:32.835 --> 00:40:35.037
-Yes.
-Is he in elementary school?

00:40:35.104 --> 00:40:36.906
Yes. Sixth grade.

00:40:36.972 --> 00:40:41.210
I see. Your son called you
on his smartphone?

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:44.747
No, he doesn't have a smartphone.

00:40:45.314 --> 00:40:46.649
I see.

00:40:47.149 --> 00:40:49.785
Actually, my sister's daughter,

00:40:49.852 --> 00:40:52.021
my niece, is in fifth grade,

00:40:52.087 --> 00:40:55.157
and they're arguing about whether or not
she should have a smartphone.

00:40:55.724 --> 00:40:57.126
I totally understand.

00:40:57.192 --> 00:40:58.294
By the way,

00:40:58.360 --> 00:40:59.995
did your son find his wallet?

00:41:00.496 --> 00:41:03.766
Yes, he had left it at home.

00:41:03.832 --> 00:41:05.434
-Is that right?
-Yes.

00:41:06.969 --> 00:41:09.538
Thank you so much for coming here today.

00:41:10.573 --> 00:41:11.407
Not at all.

00:41:11.473 --> 00:41:14.310
That's all the questions we have
for today.

00:41:14.376 --> 00:41:15.210
Detective Tobina.

00:41:15.945 --> 00:41:17.246
Please see her out.

00:41:19.448 --> 00:41:20.282
Yes.

00:41:42.371 --> 00:41:44.873
I didn't know you became a detective.

00:41:46.241 --> 00:41:47.743
What's up with you, Junichi?

00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:49.812
You didn't contact me even once.

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:53.582
-Why are you laughing?
-Because

00:41:54.283 --> 00:41:56.986
I totally thought
you had forgotten about me.

00:41:57.052 --> 00:41:59.054
There's no way I'd forget you.

00:41:59.121 --> 00:42:00.789
You didn't even blink an eye when we met.

00:42:00.856 --> 00:42:02.625
I heard from Naoto

00:42:02.691 --> 00:42:05.894
that you appeared before him
as a detective.

00:42:08.664 --> 00:42:09.898
I see.

00:42:13.202 --> 00:42:14.703
What? Is there something on my face?

00:42:17.006 --> 00:42:18.440
You haven't changed at all.

00:42:19.642 --> 00:42:20.776
You too, Junichi.

00:42:26.382 --> 00:42:27.516
But man,

00:42:28.183 --> 00:42:31.086
I was surprised to hear that you have
a child in sixth grade

00:42:31.587 --> 00:42:33.055
and became a hairdresser.

00:42:33.789 --> 00:42:35.424
You surprised me too.

00:42:35.924 --> 00:42:39.895
The Junichi we grew up with
is now a detective.

00:42:44.266 --> 00:42:47.403
It's been 23 years.

00:42:48.704 --> 00:42:49.605
Yeah.

00:42:52.441 --> 00:42:55.244
Where are you living right now?
Near Yokohama?

00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:57.179
No, around here.

00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:58.647
Since when?

00:42:58.714 --> 00:42:59.915
Two months ago.

00:42:59.982 --> 00:43:01.116
What?

00:43:01.183 --> 00:43:04.119
Why are you being such a stranger?
You should've contacted me.

00:43:04.186 --> 00:43:05.020
How could I?

00:43:05.087 --> 00:43:06.989
I don't have your contact information.

00:43:22.805 --> 00:43:24.006
MAKIKO IWAMOTO

00:43:24.073 --> 00:43:25.340
Contact me any time.

00:43:27.009 --> 00:43:28.043
Thanks.

00:43:36.752 --> 00:43:37.786
Hey…

00:43:37.853 --> 00:43:38.687
Yeah?

00:43:40.989 --> 00:43:41.924
-Your name…
-Ah.

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:43.025
Oh?

00:43:44.026 --> 00:43:47.129
You're wondering why I'm using
my maiden name when I have a kid?

00:43:47.196 --> 00:43:48.297
Yes, exactly.

00:43:48.831 --> 00:43:49.865
I got divorced.

00:43:52.367 --> 00:43:53.202
Oh.

00:43:54.303 --> 00:43:55.571
I see.

00:43:56.071 --> 00:43:56.905
Oh,

00:43:57.573 --> 00:44:00.476
I'll introduce you to my ex-husband.

00:44:03.112 --> 00:44:05.013
Long time no see, Junichi.

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:05.914
What?

00:44:06.515 --> 00:44:07.649
Keisuke?

00:44:10.119 --> 00:44:11.687
Keisuke!

00:44:11.754 --> 00:44:12.888
Wow.

00:44:13.455 --> 00:44:15.524
-No way.
-How have you been?

00:44:15.591 --> 00:44:16.759
What a surprise.

00:44:16.825 --> 00:44:18.093
I can tell.

00:44:19.094 --> 00:44:21.830
Reunion number three, huh.

00:44:24.166 --> 00:44:25.167
You haven't changed.

00:44:25.734 --> 00:44:28.270
Ms. Makiko Iwamoto
was my old classmate after all.

00:44:29.705 --> 00:44:32.074
She was teasing me,
pretending she forgot about me.

00:44:32.141 --> 00:44:34.443
She was always like that.

00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:37.379
She's lying.

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.114
She is?

00:44:39.181 --> 00:44:40.682
Ms. Makiko Iwamoto

00:44:40.749 --> 00:44:43.619
is clearly lying.

00:44:45.888 --> 00:44:46.789
Please elaborate.

00:44:46.855 --> 00:44:49.725
I didn't know you became a detective.

00:44:53.061 --> 00:44:54.062
Hello.

00:44:55.364 --> 00:44:56.598
I understand.

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:00.169
We have an emergency meeting.

00:45:00.235 --> 00:45:02.037
MITSUBA POLICE STATION

00:45:02.104 --> 00:45:04.439
We have called you all together

00:45:04.506 --> 00:45:06.909
as an emergency situation has come up.

00:45:07.676 --> 00:45:10.212
Furthermore, you are strictly prohibited
from disclosing

00:45:10.279 --> 00:45:12.114
the information I am about to share,

00:45:12.181 --> 00:45:13.182
for any reason whatsoever.

00:45:13.248 --> 00:45:15.751
The handling of this information,

00:45:15.818 --> 00:45:18.287
including its potential release
to the media,

00:45:18.353 --> 00:45:21.456
is being discussed by senior officials
of the prefectural police.

00:45:23.192 --> 00:45:26.895
The bullet extracted from the body
of the victim, Hideyuki Sakuma,

00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:31.633
was determined to have been fired
from New Nambu M60.

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:32.801
Seriously?

00:45:32.868 --> 00:45:36.839
The New Nambu M60, the standard issue
handgun of our police force,

00:45:36.905 --> 00:45:40.309
was the weapon used
in the murder of a civilian.

00:45:40.375 --> 00:45:42.578
That's the shocking result we received.

00:45:42.644 --> 00:45:43.979
That's crazy.

00:45:44.046 --> 00:45:46.248
The handgun in question
has already been identified.

00:45:46.315 --> 00:45:48.283
It was determined to be the handgun

00:45:48.784 --> 00:45:52.054
of Police Officer Kazuo Kiyohara,
who died in the line of duty 23 years ago

00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:55.390
and whose weapon
had been missing ever since.

00:45:57.693 --> 00:46:00.329
Twenty-three years ago,
within this jurisdiction,

00:46:00.829 --> 00:46:03.131
there was a robbery
of an armored cash transport vehicle…

00:46:03.198 --> 00:46:04.199
YAMATO TRUST BANK ROBBERY CASE

00:46:04.266 --> 00:46:06.969
…belonging to the Mitsuba branch
of the Yamato Trust Bank.

00:46:07.035 --> 00:46:08.337
Stand back!

00:46:08.403 --> 00:46:11.240
Put down that bag!

00:46:15.244 --> 00:46:17.112
The culprit, Nobukazu Oshima,

00:46:17.179 --> 00:46:18.680
stole 30 million yen in cash

00:46:18.747 --> 00:46:21.250
and fled to a forest five kilometers away.

00:46:22.451 --> 00:46:24.019
He had an encounter with Officer Kiyohara.

00:46:24.753 --> 00:46:26.054
There,

00:46:26.722 --> 00:46:30.425
he and Officer Kiyohara
shot each other, and both died.

00:46:31.093 --> 00:46:31.927
Oshima is believed

00:46:31.994 --> 00:46:35.530
to have had an accomplice, who is said
to have taken the 30 million yen

00:46:35.597 --> 00:46:39.468
and Officer Kiyohara's gun,

00:46:39.534 --> 00:46:43.805
but the 30 million yen and the gun
were never found

00:46:43.872 --> 00:46:44.940
and remain unknown.

00:46:46.808 --> 00:46:50.545
The handgun
that was lost 23 years ago was used

00:46:50.612 --> 00:46:51.947
in the recent incident,

00:46:52.447 --> 00:46:55.250
which is a very serious matter.

00:46:56.518 --> 00:46:58.153
We're changing the investigation strategy.

00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:01.356
Investigators have been mobilized
to locate and recover the murder weapon.

00:47:01.423 --> 00:47:04.293
Further instructions
will be given at a later date.

00:47:04.793 --> 00:47:05.827
Yes, sir.

00:47:27.282 --> 00:47:30.185
‎Dad! Dad!

00:47:31.053 --> 00:47:35.223
‎Dad! Dad!

00:47:36.425 --> 00:47:37.726
Dad!

00:47:43.365 --> 00:47:44.366
On that day

00:47:45.367 --> 00:47:47.436
the four of us committed a crime.

00:47:48.837 --> 00:47:50.172
We thought we had sealed

00:47:51.139 --> 00:47:55.410
the crime we committed in a time capsule
that would never be opened in the future.

00:47:56.545 --> 00:47:58.280
Along with that gun.

00:48:02.351 --> 00:48:03.552
This will be a secret

00:48:05.587 --> 00:48:08.557
between just the four of us.

00:48:09.691 --> 00:48:10.525
Okay?

00:48:42.924 --> 00:48:44.893
‎You came as a detective, right?

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.695
‎Can the four of us meet together?

00:48:46.762 --> 00:48:48.463
‎You came to confirm my story?

00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:49.831
‎About the lie…

00:48:49.898 --> 00:48:51.700
‎Let's open the time capsule.

00:48:51.767 --> 00:48:54.369
‎We hid the gun that caused
‎headlines back in the day.

00:48:54.436 --> 00:48:56.138
‎Let's just keep it between us for now.

00:48:56.204 --> 00:48:57.873
‎Promise you'll do that.

00:48:57.939 --> 00:48:58.874
