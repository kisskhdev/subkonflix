INHERITANCE PROPERTY DIVISION AGREEMENT

00:01:22.438 --> 00:01:25.232
"Inheritance property division agreement"?

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:35.826
SUN HEE-YEON

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:36.952
Sun Hee-yeon?

00:01:40.164 --> 00:01:43.292
Why is the seal
of a dead person stamped here?

00:01:47.922 --> 00:01:49.214
Sun Han-gyul?

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.636
Who… are you?

00:01:54.386 --> 00:01:55.387
Who am I?

00:01:56.972 --> 00:01:57.973
Well… (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:58.766 --> 00:02:00.017
"Sun Hee-yeon."

00:02:04.438 --> 00:02:07.066
It's my mom's name,
who you said died in a fire.

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:16.617
Han-gyul.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.830
How did a dead person's seal
end up on here?

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:26.543
I'll explain everything, so calm down.

00:02:26.627 --> 00:02:28.796
-People are sleeping inside--
-Is she alive?

00:02:33.676 --> 00:02:35.094
I said, is she alive?

00:02:42.351 --> 00:02:44.645
What is it? What's going on?

00:02:49.984 --> 00:02:51.485
No, it's nothing.

00:02:53.404 --> 00:02:56.699
It doesn't look like nothing to me.

00:03:03.455 --> 00:03:06.041
Go inside. I'll get you a heated blanket.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.969
EPISODE 9

00:03:22.933 --> 00:03:24.476
Eat up, Han-gyul.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.563
Your uncle made gaengsigi porridge
that you like.

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:39.908
Han-gyul.

00:03:41.035 --> 00:03:43.078
-I'm off to school.
-Wait.

00:03:43.162 --> 00:03:45.706
I need to give you an invite
to my grandma's 70th birthday.

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:47.958
You're going to school? It's too early.

00:03:50.544 --> 00:03:51.420
Hey. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:55.090
Evil Han-gyul.

00:03:58.093 --> 00:03:59.011
Why?

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:02.806
"Sun Hee-yeon."

00:04:04.308 --> 00:04:07.061
It's my mom's name,
who you said died in a fire.

00:04:08.937 --> 00:04:09.938
Is she alive?

00:04:12.066 --> 00:04:13.275
I said, is she alive?

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.198
I'll pay for the stay.

00:04:19.281 --> 00:04:21.658
-There's no need for that.
-I need to take care of it.

00:04:22.618 --> 00:04:26.371
I can't stand owing favors,
so this situation's uncomfortable for me.

00:04:27.331 --> 00:04:28.624
Let's call it even on this day.

00:04:28.707 --> 00:04:31.460
I'll buy you ice cream or something,

00:04:32.086 --> 00:04:33.378
so hit me up when you come.

00:04:43.055 --> 00:04:44.932
WORLD HISTORY

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:03.784
Hey.

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:06.078
I'm home.

00:05:07.371 --> 00:05:08.288
Han-gyul.

00:05:11.416 --> 00:05:14.336
Your mind's all over the place,
I bet it was hard to focus on the exam.

00:05:16.046 --> 00:05:20.467
Whatever you're wondering,
don't keep it inside, just ask me.

00:05:21.176 --> 00:05:24.680
I'll answer as best as I can, okay?

00:05:24.763 --> 00:05:28.183
What could I possibly expect from you,
who lied to me for 18 years?

00:05:28.267 --> 00:05:29.101
Han-gyul.

00:05:31.812 --> 00:05:34.690
Dong-pyo asked me
to help with the party tomorrow.

00:05:34.773 --> 00:05:37.484
I have to head out at dawn.
I'll go to bed early.

00:05:41.488 --> 00:05:43.323
Okay, get some rest.

00:05:43.407 --> 00:05:45.576
We'll talk after the party tomorrow, okay?

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.037
Ask me anything
you're curious about, all right?

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.725
I'm not going to ask you, Uncle.

00:06:10.684 --> 00:06:12.394
I'll ask her directly.

00:06:16.815 --> 00:06:20.027
"Seocho-gu, 33-5 Balpo-dong."

00:06:30.454 --> 00:06:31.496
What's this?

00:06:32.247 --> 00:06:36.001
It's a new marketing trick
from a small-town lawyer with no clients.

00:06:41.548 --> 00:06:42.841
LEGAL BRIEFS

00:06:45.844 --> 00:06:47.179
COURT RULINGS ON TEACHER ASSAULT

00:06:47.262 --> 00:06:49.932
You mentioned
a colleague of your colleague

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:52.726
who got assaulted by a parent.

00:06:56.355 --> 00:07:00.651
I put together the legal briefs
and court rulings from cases I worked on.

00:07:01.151 --> 00:07:03.946
I thought they might be useful
for that colleague.

00:07:04.905 --> 00:07:06.615
I appreciate it...

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:12.246
but I think that colleague
would rather bury it and move on.

00:07:21.922 --> 00:07:23.674
Nothing in the world
should just be buried.

00:07:28.178 --> 00:07:31.306
Once you bury something,
it's even harder to dig back up.

00:07:35.727 --> 00:07:37.062
Then pass along this message.

00:07:37.729 --> 00:07:39.898
I'll deal with the mess myself.

00:07:40.607 --> 00:07:41.483
Don't forget,

00:07:42.401 --> 00:07:44.528
Attorney Choi I-jun...

00:07:46.196 --> 00:07:47.364
is always on your side.

00:08:12.264 --> 00:08:14.725
Did Sun Jae-gyu make all of this
by himself?

00:08:14.808 --> 00:08:15.684
No way.

00:08:15.767 --> 00:08:19.646
At first, he seemed like
a total disaster as a bachelor,

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:22.149
but it turns out
he's the perfect husband material.

00:08:26.945 --> 00:08:27.779
Thanks.

00:08:28.864 --> 00:08:30.657
First of all,

00:08:30.741 --> 00:08:35.120
I sincerely congratulate Mrs. Yang Bok-hee
on her wonderful 70th birthday.

00:08:41.168 --> 00:08:43.628
Knowing that many elders would be here,

00:08:43.712 --> 00:08:48.175
I focused on balancing
both health and taste.

00:08:48.258 --> 00:08:51.136
If you look here,
for the marinated flounder,

00:08:51.219 --> 00:08:55.182
I used pear juice instead of sugar
to be mindful of blood sugar levels.

00:08:55.265 --> 00:08:56.683
As for the jeon,

00:08:56.767 --> 00:08:59.603
I used half soybean oil
and half perilla oil

00:08:59.686 --> 00:09:02.439
to keep the smoke point down
and bring out the flavor.

00:09:02.522 --> 00:09:05.400
Make yourself at home,
there's plenty of food.

00:09:05.484 --> 00:09:06.777
Enjoy as much as you like.

00:09:07.861 --> 00:09:08.820
One more thing.

00:09:09.738 --> 00:09:11.656
I'll grill the ribs on the spot.

00:09:19.206 --> 00:09:22.501
LA galbi. Next person. Hope you enjoy.

00:09:22.584 --> 00:09:23.877
Next in line.

00:09:24.753 --> 00:09:26.755
What's going on?
You haven't answered my texts.

00:09:28.131 --> 00:09:31.301
As you can see, I've got my hands full
with all the food prep.

00:09:32.135 --> 00:09:35.222
I've been meaning
to discuss something about Han-gyul.

00:09:40.936 --> 00:09:42.229
Okay.

00:09:44.898 --> 00:09:45.774
How about yukhoe?

00:09:46.775 --> 00:09:48.902
Here, grill it yourself.

00:09:48.985 --> 00:09:50.904
Ms. Bom, come over for a second.

00:09:56.701 --> 00:09:58.203
Did something happen with Han-gyul?

00:09:58.286 --> 00:09:59.538
That's the strange thing.

00:09:59.621 --> 00:10:01.289
He hasn't asked about his mom at all.

00:10:01.373 --> 00:10:03.667
It's a party, so noodles are a must.

00:10:04.876 --> 00:10:06.628
Yes, sure.

00:10:06.711 --> 00:10:08.713
Here you go, enjoy.

00:10:08.797 --> 00:10:09.714
Thanks.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.175
-It's self-serve from here on.
-Sorry?

00:10:18.723 --> 00:10:21.977
Geez, there are so many people here.
There's no time to talk.

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.020
So, where's Han-gyul?

00:10:26.148 --> 00:10:27.274
Is he not here?

00:10:27.357 --> 00:10:29.234
He headed out at dawn to help Dong-pyo.

00:10:29.317 --> 00:10:30.485
I haven't seen him.

00:10:31.653 --> 00:10:32.821
Then where is he?

00:10:32.904 --> 00:10:33.780
Look at you two!

00:10:36.366 --> 00:10:38.285
Standing side by side like this.

00:10:38.368 --> 00:10:39.744
You two look wonderful together.

00:10:40.996 --> 00:10:42.080
How is everything?

00:10:42.581 --> 00:10:44.458
-Everything okay between you?
-Auntie!

00:10:46.668 --> 00:10:47.502
Ma'am.

00:10:48.753 --> 00:10:50.755
Saying things like that
could get us in trouble.

00:10:51.923 --> 00:10:53.049
Wait!

00:10:54.426 --> 00:10:55.510
Isn't that tuna?

00:10:57.679 --> 00:10:58.847
There's only one tuna.

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:01.141
Only the fastest will get a taste.

00:11:01.224 --> 00:11:02.642
-Really?
-Where is it?

00:11:07.522 --> 00:11:11.318
So, have you guys started
working on having a kid?

00:11:12.652 --> 00:11:14.613
Ma'am, I'll explain everything later,

00:11:14.696 --> 00:11:16.031
so please keep it down.

00:11:16.114 --> 00:11:18.992
There's nothing embarrassing
about trying to have a baby.

00:11:19.075 --> 00:11:21.870
You're the man of the house,
so you need to work a little harder.

00:11:21.953 --> 00:11:23.914
You said you were hoping for a daughter.

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:29.169
Did you just say...

00:11:34.007 --> 00:11:36.426
"daughter"?

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.304
Mr. Choi, that's not it.

00:11:39.387 --> 00:11:42.224
Hey, Bom-sik's mom and dad,
I didn't know you were here.

00:11:44.601 --> 00:11:46.937
They come to the clinic together
and are inseparable,

00:11:47.604 --> 00:11:49.814
and today's no exception.

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:54.819
All the people
at the market have been talking.

00:11:54.903 --> 00:11:59.574
When she buys a pot,
he's there carrying it for her.

00:11:59.658 --> 00:12:00.992
What a gentleman.

00:12:01.076 --> 00:12:02.244
No, I didn't...

00:12:02.953 --> 00:12:04.162
See? I knew it.

00:12:04.246 --> 00:12:05.914
What's the point of me staying quiet?

00:12:05.997 --> 00:12:08.416
You guys went around
basically telling everyone in town.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.376
Mr. Jeong!

00:12:10.335 --> 00:12:11.503
Don't.

00:12:11.586 --> 00:12:12.796
You can't break your word--

00:12:12.879 --> 00:12:15.590
Han-gyul's uncle,
let's make this absolutely clear.

00:12:15.674 --> 00:12:17.050
I, Jeong Jin-hyeok,

00:12:17.759 --> 00:12:19.427
swear I never told anyone

00:12:19.511 --> 00:12:23.848
that you two were hugging in private.

00:12:23.932 --> 00:12:25.934
I've never mentioned the fact

00:12:26.017 --> 00:12:29.437
that you got down on your knees,
begging me to keep it a secret.

00:12:30.021 --> 00:12:32.315
All the others here
have given their account.

00:12:37.529 --> 00:12:38.655
Han-gyul's uncle is...

00:12:40.574 --> 00:12:42.242
dating Ms. Bom?

00:12:48.415 --> 00:12:49.499
What's taking him so long?

00:12:50.625 --> 00:12:52.127
He hasn't called, what the heck?

00:12:53.461 --> 00:12:54.504
Se-jin.

00:12:55.088 --> 00:12:56.631
Why are you still out here?

00:12:56.715 --> 00:12:58.592
The buffet's all set up inside.

00:12:58.675 --> 00:13:01.177
Dong-pyo, haven't you seen Evil Han-gyul?

00:13:01.261 --> 00:13:02.887
He went to Seoul.

00:13:04.139 --> 00:13:05.473
Seoul?

00:13:05.557 --> 00:13:07.559
He said he had to meet someone in Seoul.

00:13:07.642 --> 00:13:10.937
He couldn't make it today, but he left
a gift for Grandma early this morning.

00:13:12.897 --> 00:13:16.067
Right, he told me not to tell anyone.

00:13:40.884 --> 00:13:43.011
Uncle! Han-gyul's uncle.

00:13:45.722 --> 00:13:47.182
You see, Han-gyul...

00:13:48.016 --> 00:13:49.559
Well, he...

00:13:52.604 --> 00:13:53.772
What about him?

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:59.027
Sun Han-gyul went to Seoul.

00:15:01.923 --> 00:15:02.841
Who is it?

00:15:17.188 --> 00:15:18.148
Is that you, Han-gyul?

00:15:36.082 --> 00:15:37.125
I'm glad you came.

00:15:38.334 --> 00:15:39.502
I'm glad you came, Han-gyul.

00:15:45.091 --> 00:15:47.594
I'm sure you have a lot of questions.

00:15:49.512 --> 00:15:51.014
Can I ask?

00:15:54.267 --> 00:15:59.564
You were alive and well.
So why did you make me live with Uncle?

00:16:11.868 --> 00:16:12.744
Back then,

00:16:15.872 --> 00:16:16.831
I was...

00:16:18.666 --> 00:16:20.668
I was just too young.

00:16:23.004 --> 00:16:25.465
I had no idea
what I was doing when I had you,

00:16:26.966 --> 00:16:29.135
and I had to raise you alone.

00:16:29.844 --> 00:16:34.224
I couldn't earn enough
to even afford formula,

00:16:35.308 --> 00:16:37.519
so I left you with your uncle

00:16:38.436 --> 00:16:40.104
and went to work to make money.

00:16:42.273 --> 00:16:44.567
By the time I came back for you,

00:16:45.318 --> 00:16:48.029
the house had already burned down,

00:16:49.614 --> 00:16:52.867
and your uncle had left with you.

00:16:56.538 --> 00:16:58.248
You seriously call that an excuse?

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:00.500
With a few phone calls,

00:17:01.084 --> 00:17:04.128
you would've been able to find out
where I went or where I lived.

00:17:04.879 --> 00:17:09.217
Are you saying you haven't contacted me
all this time because you couldn't?

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:11.803
Your uncle

00:17:12.887 --> 00:17:14.973
wouldn't let me see you.

00:17:21.104 --> 00:17:24.858
I know it was hard for you
growing up without a mom.

00:17:25.984 --> 00:17:30.071
But all those years I lived without you
were a nightmare for me too.

00:17:34.701 --> 00:17:36.369
But Jae-gyu must've thought

00:17:39.873 --> 00:17:42.458
that if I wanted to start a new family,

00:17:43.084 --> 00:17:46.629
I had to hide the fact

00:17:48.256 --> 00:17:50.425
that you existed.

00:17:51.885 --> 00:17:55.138
He thought it was what's best
for both you and me.

00:17:55.221 --> 00:17:57.891
How's that supposed to be
what's best for me?

00:18:02.103 --> 00:18:03.062
You know what?

00:18:04.397 --> 00:18:06.983
I wasn't happy at all,
even when I came in first at school.

00:18:08.151 --> 00:18:11.029
Others might have envied my report card.

00:18:12.614 --> 00:18:16.576
But I... envied the kids
who were worried they would get yelled at

00:18:16.659 --> 00:18:18.119
by their moms for bad grades.

00:18:21.456 --> 00:18:25.335
All those award certificates and medals,

00:18:26.628 --> 00:18:29.005
maybe Uncle was proud of them,

00:18:29.881 --> 00:18:31.341
but I wasn't.

00:18:32.967 --> 00:18:35.970
I could see I was using
those things to try and cover up

00:18:36.054 --> 00:18:37.805
my insecurity of not having a mom.

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:44.062
May I take your order?

00:18:46.105 --> 00:18:48.483
Han-gyul, let's eat something first.

00:18:48.566 --> 00:18:51.277
You came all the way to Seoul
and haven't eaten anything, right?

00:18:52.737 --> 00:18:54.656
I'll have the truffle oil gnocchi.

00:19:04.666 --> 00:19:05.708
The same for him, please.

00:19:08.419 --> 00:19:10.672
Is that all right, son?

00:19:15.551 --> 00:19:18.137
What on earth is going on, Mr. Choi?

00:19:18.638 --> 00:19:22.141
I acted like I was divorced so things
would work out between you and Ms. Bom.

00:19:22.225 --> 00:19:24.435
I just gave Ms. Jeong an update

00:19:24.519 --> 00:19:26.896
that everything's going well
between you two.

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:27.814
Mr. Oh.

00:19:29.232 --> 00:19:32.443
I want to be alone and quiet
like a rock on a hill.

00:19:33.736 --> 00:19:36.990
Could you please
go have some tuna belly or something?

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:47.083
Ms. Hye-suk,
why are you looking at me like that?

00:19:48.668 --> 00:19:51.212
Seong-tae, have you never been married?

00:19:51.295 --> 00:19:52.213
Sorry?

00:19:55.258 --> 00:19:56.718
-It's true.
-Well...

00:19:56.801 --> 00:20:00.346
Hye-suk, please hear me out.
Let me explain why I did that.

00:20:03.016 --> 00:20:04.058
It's because of Ms. Bom.

00:20:05.143 --> 00:20:09.480
So, Mr. Choi is interested in Ms. Bom.

00:20:09.564 --> 00:20:10.982
I didn't have a way to help.

00:20:12.358 --> 00:20:14.986
Then I heard
you're the one closest to her.

00:20:17.113 --> 00:20:20.116
So basically, you didn't have
any feelings for me.

00:20:21.743 --> 00:20:22.577
Well...

00:20:24.328 --> 00:20:25.163
But...

00:20:27.331 --> 00:20:28.666
Hye-suk.

00:20:29.959 --> 00:20:30.877
Hye-suk!

00:20:35.757 --> 00:20:37.967
This is driving me crazy.

00:20:53.357 --> 00:20:55.318
I wish we could talk more,

00:20:55.985 --> 00:20:57.904
but you didn't tell your uncle
you came here,

00:20:57.987 --> 00:20:59.697
so I'm a little worried.

00:21:00.281 --> 00:21:04.285
If he finds out you came here,
he might not let you come see me again.

00:21:06.079 --> 00:21:07.080
Does that mean...

00:21:09.165 --> 00:21:10.750
it's okay for me to come again?

00:21:10.833 --> 00:21:11.751
Of course.

00:21:12.251 --> 00:21:14.921
Can I really come by?

00:21:17.924 --> 00:21:20.093
Is it okay if I give you a call?

00:21:20.718 --> 00:21:21.844
Sure.

00:21:21.928 --> 00:21:24.847
You have your family around.
Are you really sure it's okay?

00:21:27.225 --> 00:21:29.811
You're my family too.

00:21:33.022 --> 00:21:34.440
Let me ask you one more thing.

00:21:38.111 --> 00:21:39.654
Can I call you "Mom"?

00:22:01.467 --> 00:22:02.426
Right.

00:22:04.178 --> 00:22:05.012
Her number.

00:22:24.532 --> 00:22:25.950
I did what you told me to do.

00:22:28.828 --> 00:22:29.787
I swear I did.

00:22:30.788 --> 00:22:34.584
I told him I didn't leave him,
and that you wouldn't let me see him.

00:22:34.667 --> 00:22:37.587
I told him I did try to find him,
but I just couldn't.

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:39.755
I also said he's my family too

00:22:39.839 --> 00:22:41.799
and he can come anytime he wants.

00:22:42.967 --> 00:22:46.554
I said exactly what you told me,
every single word.

00:22:46.637 --> 00:22:50.183
Your uncle had left with you.

00:22:50.266 --> 00:22:52.101
He wouldn't let me see you.

00:22:52.185 --> 00:22:54.896
You're my family too.

00:23:00.443 --> 00:23:05.281
If you hurt Han-gyul,
even a tiny bit, I won't forgive you.

00:23:06.657 --> 00:23:08.326
From now on, whenever Han-gyul comes by,

00:23:09.076 --> 00:23:10.328
you smile no matter what.

00:23:11.495 --> 00:23:13.331
Whenever he calls,
you answer no matter what.

00:23:14.707 --> 00:23:18.544
You haven't been there for Han-gyul
until now, so make it up to him.

00:23:21.923 --> 00:23:25.051
Don't ever mention
that you abandoned Han-gyul.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.305
And if he asks...

00:23:32.141 --> 00:23:33.684
you blame me, no matter what.

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:38.272
That's the condition for me
to sign the agreement.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.358
You understand?

00:23:40.441 --> 00:23:42.276
Yes, I got it.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.153
So that's a promise, okay?

00:23:45.571 --> 00:23:46.572
I'm so relieved.

00:23:47.114 --> 00:23:48.324
Yes, thanks so much.

00:23:48.407 --> 00:23:53.120
Well, Han-gyul just left,
so he should be on the train soon.

00:23:53.204 --> 00:23:54.080
One moment.

00:23:56.249 --> 00:23:58.584
I've got to go pick up my kid.

00:23:58.668 --> 00:24:02.797
So, shall we decide
when we'll sign the papers?

00:24:03.965 --> 00:24:05.216
Are you coming to Seoul?

00:24:05.841 --> 00:24:08.427
No, it's fine, I can go there. I'll go.

00:24:46.299 --> 00:24:47.842
EVIL HAN-GYUL

00:24:47.925 --> 00:24:49.010
What?

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:53.347
Wait, why's Han-gyul calling you?

00:24:55.599 --> 00:24:56.517
Hey.

00:24:57.518 --> 00:24:58.352
Yes.

00:24:59.103 --> 00:24:59.979
What?

00:25:01.564 --> 00:25:02.398
Yeah.

00:25:03.524 --> 00:25:06.110
Okay, bye.

00:25:10.323 --> 00:25:12.450
Jjun, give me a ride to Seoul.

00:25:14.243 --> 00:25:15.077
Hold on.

00:25:15.995 --> 00:25:18.789
So you want to go see Sun Han-gyul?

00:25:18.873 --> 00:25:19.874
All the way to Seoul?

00:25:19.957 --> 00:25:22.460
I'll tell you everything on the way.

00:25:23.586 --> 00:25:25.671
Didn't you say you wanted to beat him?

00:25:26.422 --> 00:25:29.216
You said you'd do anything
if I helped you crush Han-gyul.

00:25:31.427 --> 00:25:33.095
But he needs me.

00:25:34.638 --> 00:25:39.435
Yes, I do want to win against him
and I do want to crush him.

00:25:41.228 --> 00:25:42.813
But for now, I have to go see him.

00:25:43.689 --> 00:25:45.149
So please, take me there, okay?

00:25:45.232 --> 00:25:46.817
Hurry up. Let's go now.

00:25:48.444 --> 00:25:50.196
Wow, the bubbles are coming out nicely.

00:25:53.366 --> 00:25:54.617
They're floating really far.

00:25:56.619 --> 00:25:57.453
Try again. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:26:10.966 --> 00:26:12.009
Here, eat this.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.638
Just sitting here won't solve anything.

00:26:17.223 --> 00:26:19.934
Han-gyul used to be that small too.

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:24.397
Have I ever told you?

00:26:25.731 --> 00:26:28.984
About Han-gyul
during his school performance.

00:26:30.945 --> 00:26:33.155
SHINSU KINDERGARTEN TALENT SHOW

00:26:33.739 --> 00:26:36.575
Ding-dong, the bell rings

00:26:36.659 --> 00:26:39.912
I ran to open the door

00:26:39.995 --> 00:26:44.333
And there was my dad I'd been waiting for

00:26:44.417 --> 00:26:48.587
Standing in front of the door

00:26:48.671 --> 00:26:52.007
I was so happy that I smiled

00:26:52.091 --> 00:26:55.594
And called out, "Daddy"

00:26:55.678 --> 00:26:59.598
But his face looked

00:26:59.682 --> 00:27:03.561
A little sad today

00:27:03.644 --> 00:27:07.690
Did something happen?

00:27:07.773 --> 00:27:11.193
Is something worrying you?

00:27:11.277 --> 00:27:13.863
Did something...

00:27:13.946 --> 00:27:15.030
Han-gyul, I'm here.

00:27:15.114 --> 00:27:19.118
Go wrong today?

00:27:19.201 --> 00:27:22.496
-Cheer up, Daddy.
-Cheer up, Uncle.

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:26.500
I'm here for you

00:27:26.584 --> 00:27:30.087
-Cheer up, Daddy
-Cheer up, Uncle

00:27:30.171 --> 00:27:34.258
I'm here for you

00:27:34.341 --> 00:27:37.970
Cheer up

00:27:44.935 --> 00:27:46.145
Uncle!

00:27:48.606 --> 00:27:52.109
People probably thought I was crying
because I was so moved,

00:27:54.487 --> 00:27:55.404
but that wasn't why.

00:27:56.197 --> 00:27:58.616
I cried because I was heartbroken.

00:28:02.161 --> 00:28:04.580
He was growing up
not knowing what his parents looked like.

00:28:07.124 --> 00:28:08.542
It broke my heart.

00:28:13.964 --> 00:28:14.924
Sorry.

00:28:15.883 --> 00:28:19.470
Everything with Han-gyul was so crazy,
I didn't even think about how you'd feel.

00:28:22.348 --> 00:28:26.727
Now that people have found out,
you can't be feeling great either.

00:28:30.189 --> 00:28:31.899
Laozi once said,

00:28:32.816 --> 00:28:35.486
"When life gets overwhelming
and complicated, think simple."

00:28:36.403 --> 00:28:39.823
For now, let's just think about Han-gyul.

00:28:44.453 --> 00:28:45.538
You should eat.

00:28:47.206 --> 00:28:48.457
It'll give you some energy.

00:28:50.334 --> 00:28:52.503
Okay, I'll eat.

00:28:52.586 --> 00:28:54.088
I should eat.

00:29:00.344 --> 00:29:01.554
It's good.

00:29:01.637 --> 00:29:03.180
-It's so good.
-Really?

00:29:20.239 --> 00:29:22.283
I'm not in the mood to take your call.
Hang up.

00:29:25.494 --> 00:29:26.328
What?

00:29:28.581 --> 00:29:30.833
-Why you?
-That's exactly my point.

00:29:30.916 --> 00:29:33.544
Why do I have to drive all the way
to Seoul to get your nephew?

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:40.801
Ever since he was tiny,
I'd comfort him, carry him, feed him,

00:29:40.884 --> 00:29:43.762
and now he's making
my dear little sister go to Seoul?

00:29:44.513 --> 00:29:45.472
Even so,

00:29:46.515 --> 00:29:48.434
I'm letting you know
since I should update you

00:29:48.517 --> 00:29:49.351
as his guardian.

00:29:49.977 --> 00:29:51.645
So no need to worry, you punk.

00:29:54.815 --> 00:29:55.899
Jjun.

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:04.908
Since when did you start
having feelings for Han-gyul?

00:30:06.201 --> 00:30:09.330
Jjun... No, I-jun, I mean, dear brother.

00:30:10.372 --> 00:30:12.166
I didn't mean to lie to you.

00:30:12.249 --> 00:30:15.753
You and Han-gyul's uncle
already don't get along.

00:30:15.836 --> 00:30:21.175
I was afraid talking about Han-gyul
might make you feel even worse.

00:30:37.858 --> 00:30:39.902
I'll be around having some coffee.

00:30:40.736 --> 00:30:42.071
Call me when you're done.

00:30:42.655 --> 00:30:43.489
Will do.

00:30:44.073 --> 00:30:47.534
I'll carry this gratitude
with me to the grave.

00:30:47.618 --> 00:30:48.494
I promise.

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:51.830
Go on, someone's waiting for you.

00:31:17.981 --> 00:31:19.900
This is where you wanted to come?

00:31:20.734 --> 00:31:23.153
You really came?

00:31:24.571 --> 00:31:25.823
"You really came"?

00:31:26.949 --> 00:31:29.493
What are you doing?
Can't you see how hot this is?

00:31:30.119 --> 00:31:30.994
Right.

00:31:33.122 --> 00:31:33.997
Sorry.

00:31:58.522 --> 00:32:00.190
-Is it good?
-Yes.

00:32:06.071 --> 00:32:08.699
That darn jerk.

00:32:09.992 --> 00:32:11.452
I should've known

00:32:11.535 --> 00:32:14.163
from the moment he started sweet-talking
with his smug grin.

00:32:14.246 --> 00:32:16.874
You knucklehead.

00:32:17.416 --> 00:32:18.250
Ms. Seo.

00:32:19.418 --> 00:32:21.378
Hey, Mr. Jeong!

00:32:22.171 --> 00:32:23.839
It's you, Mr. Jeong.

00:32:24.757 --> 00:32:26.550
Have a seat.

00:32:28.135 --> 00:32:29.052
Mr. Jeong.

00:32:30.012 --> 00:32:35.350
Mr. Jeong, where did you hear
about that slick jerk?

00:32:35.434 --> 00:32:37.686
Well, of course I'd find out,

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:39.938
since I cared.

00:32:41.106 --> 00:32:44.693
You were completely head over heels
for him. Why's that?

00:32:44.777 --> 00:32:47.029
He's not even good-looking,

00:32:47.112 --> 00:32:49.490
just boring and plain,
like a half-chewed rice cake.

00:32:51.825 --> 00:32:52.785
My name.

00:32:54.578 --> 00:32:55.913
What, your name?

00:32:59.291 --> 00:33:02.252
He just looked at me quietly...

00:33:04.338 --> 00:33:05.672
and then called my name.

00:33:06.882 --> 00:33:08.842
He said, "Hye-suk."

00:33:10.177 --> 00:33:11.720
Unbelievable.

00:33:11.804 --> 00:33:14.473
Of all things,
I can't believe you fell for that.

00:33:15.057 --> 00:33:17.184
When you get past 50,

00:33:18.894 --> 00:33:20.854
everything starts to feel blurry.

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:26.026
Life doesn't feel vivid anymore.

00:33:28.904 --> 00:33:32.241
But when he called my name,

00:33:33.492 --> 00:33:38.372
everything suddenly felt so vivid,
like I was truly myself again.

00:33:39.122 --> 00:33:43.252
My senses felt sharp,
like I'd put on a pair of glasses.

00:33:44.461 --> 00:33:45.921
My instincts felt alive again.

00:33:48.966 --> 00:33:53.846
And just like that,
I totally fell for him.

00:33:58.225 --> 00:34:00.102
Never mind what I was rambling about.

00:34:02.521 --> 00:34:05.482
Still, thanks for letting me know

00:34:06.775 --> 00:34:09.111
and for coming here.

00:34:10.404 --> 00:34:12.155
I'm a little drunk.

00:34:12.739 --> 00:34:15.242
See you at school tomorrow.

00:34:15.325 --> 00:34:16.326
My goodness.

00:34:17.244 --> 00:34:19.746
Don't forget your bag again.
You always forget.

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:21.415
Thank you.

00:34:21.498 --> 00:34:23.041
I'll get you a taxi. Let's go.

00:34:23.125 --> 00:34:24.960
I'm dizzy.
Take care of the check with that.

00:34:25.043 --> 00:34:27.004
I got this. How much do I owe?

00:34:28.171 --> 00:34:30.883
When I found out my mom was still alive,

00:34:31.675 --> 00:34:35.554
I just knew that she had abandoned me.

00:34:37.848 --> 00:34:42.185
But... I couldn't bring myself
to accept it.

00:34:44.521 --> 00:34:47.649
So I wanted to meet her
in person to see for myself.

00:34:51.236 --> 00:34:52.988
It must've been the worst day ever.

00:34:54.823 --> 00:34:56.533
Do you know what was even worse?

00:34:58.535 --> 00:35:01.538
I'm not hurt because she abandoned me.

00:35:02.748 --> 00:35:03.582
Then why?

00:35:05.334 --> 00:35:06.543
Because we grew apart.

00:35:10.213 --> 00:35:12.382
I only got to see her once,

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:16.303
and now it feels like
I'll never see her again.

00:35:25.479 --> 00:35:27.147
Hey, Sun Han-gyul.

00:35:30.442 --> 00:35:33.070
You're someone everyone loves.

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:37.783
She's just one person
out of eight billion people on Earth.

00:35:39.117 --> 00:35:41.912
Can't you just accept
that there could be just one person

00:35:41.995 --> 00:35:43.121
who might not love you?

00:35:45.415 --> 00:35:49.086
It's not just... one person.

00:35:49.169 --> 00:35:51.672
Geez, who else doesn't like you?

00:35:58.887 --> 00:35:59.763
Me?

00:36:03.558 --> 00:36:04.393
Hey.

00:36:05.435 --> 00:36:08.230
Do you seriously think I came
all the way here to pay for my stay?

00:36:10.732 --> 00:36:14.277
Can't you see my outfit?
Can't you see my shoes?

00:36:14.361 --> 00:36:16.029
Can't you see my lip tint?

00:36:16.738 --> 00:36:19.032
I was afraid it'd look too obvious
if it was too red,

00:36:19.116 --> 00:36:21.326
so I patted it on with my fingers.

00:36:21.952 --> 00:36:23.662
I tied my hair as if I didn't care,

00:36:23.745 --> 00:36:27.249
but I actually followed a video
and redid it three times.

00:36:27.916 --> 00:36:31.211
And if I didn't like you,

00:36:31.294 --> 00:36:34.423
would I have begged my brother
to drive 400 km to see you?

00:36:35.716 --> 00:36:39.845
Are you saying you actually like me?

00:36:41.346 --> 00:36:42.264
Wait.

00:36:42.931 --> 00:36:45.017
Am I being set up to confess here?

00:36:49.312 --> 00:36:50.230
Sun Han-gyul.

00:36:52.274 --> 00:36:53.608
I want to beat you.

00:36:55.444 --> 00:36:58.196
I want to crush you and take you down.

00:37:00.866 --> 00:37:05.078
But I keep finding myself drawn to you,
and it's driving me crazy.

00:37:09.541 --> 00:37:11.293
And what really drives me crazy is

00:37:12.669 --> 00:37:15.338
that I'm just one
of eight billion people who like you.

00:37:17.382 --> 00:37:20.427
It's pretty humiliating
and incredibly unpleasant.

00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:24.681
Still, I...

00:37:26.349 --> 00:37:27.184
Well...

00:37:27.768 --> 00:37:28.810
I like you.

00:37:33.732 --> 00:37:36.651
I'm saying I like you.

00:37:42.032 --> 00:37:42.866
Hold on.

00:37:43.742 --> 00:37:45.786
Did Sun Han-gyul just confess to me?

00:37:49.748 --> 00:37:50.749
Thank you...

00:37:52.584 --> 00:37:55.504
for saving me from the worst day.

00:38:09.101 --> 00:38:11.228
What? Don't look at me like that.

00:38:11.311 --> 00:38:12.145
Why?

00:38:15.941 --> 00:38:16.942
What?

00:38:50.976 --> 00:38:52.185
I'm back.

00:38:52.811 --> 00:38:54.229
Hey.

00:38:56.898 --> 00:38:58.692
You must be tired. Go get some sleep.

00:39:00.193 --> 00:39:01.153
Uncle.

00:39:04.447 --> 00:39:05.574
What is it?

00:39:07.325 --> 00:39:08.535
Is there something to eat?

00:39:19.462 --> 00:39:21.631
You know, like those restaurants
you see on TV?

00:39:21.715 --> 00:39:23.508
Is it called a "chandelier"?

00:39:23.592 --> 00:39:26.011
There was something sparkling
hanging from the ceiling.

00:39:26.469 --> 00:39:29.723
The server was wearing a suit
and asked, "May I take your order?"

00:39:29.806 --> 00:39:30.932
Wow.

00:39:32.267 --> 00:39:35.812
Looks like your mom took you
to the fanciest place.

00:39:37.189 --> 00:39:40.108
I couldn't tell what was what on the menu.

00:39:40.859 --> 00:39:43.278
She said, "Give my son what I'm having."

00:39:43.361 --> 00:39:45.238
So I got a thing called "gnocchi."

00:39:47.157 --> 00:39:49.409
It was this small,
kind of like a dumpling.

00:39:49.492 --> 00:39:53.038
It came in a creamy sauce
and was soft and rich.

00:39:53.121 --> 00:39:54.831
It slid down my throat smoothly--

00:39:54.915 --> 00:39:56.124
I'm sorry.

00:39:58.627 --> 00:40:03.215
If I knew you'd be this happy,
I should've let you see your mom sooner.

00:40:04.758 --> 00:40:08.178
She told you to call her again
and come see her again, right?

00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:14.851
She wouldn't stop telling me to come by

00:40:16.144 --> 00:40:17.896
and call her again.

00:40:19.231 --> 00:40:20.106
Good.

00:40:20.899 --> 00:40:23.360
Go see her often from now on, okay?

00:40:25.278 --> 00:40:26.112
I won't.

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:28.615
Why not?

00:40:30.075 --> 00:40:30.909
It's too far.

00:40:31.493 --> 00:40:33.036
It's not too far.

00:40:33.119 --> 00:40:35.372
Just say when.
I'll take you there anytime.

00:40:35.455 --> 00:40:37.332
It's not really my thing.

00:40:37.415 --> 00:40:39.501
I just tried the gnocchi out of curiosity.

00:40:40.126 --> 00:40:43.296
I prefer something spicy,
like gaengsigi porridge.

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:51.680
You got some more?

00:40:51.763 --> 00:40:52.681
Of course!

00:40:52.764 --> 00:40:55.308
I grabbed some fresh bean sprouts
at the market

00:40:55.392 --> 00:40:57.060
and cooked up a big pot.

00:40:58.478 --> 00:40:59.646
All right.

00:41:13.034 --> 00:41:14.911
-Uncle.
-What?

00:41:15.578 --> 00:41:17.664
I'm going out with Se-jin now.

00:41:19.416 --> 00:41:20.625
For real?

00:41:20.709 --> 00:41:23.336
Turns out, she had feelings for me too.

00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:24.921
Hey.

00:41:25.005 --> 00:41:27.007
Congratulations, Han-gyul.

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:28.758
Who could possibly not like you?

00:41:29.384 --> 00:41:30.885
So, did you confess?

00:41:30.969 --> 00:41:32.387
Did she say yes right away?

00:41:33.471 --> 00:41:36.057
-We had ramyeon at the Hangang River.
-Look at you!

00:41:36.141 --> 00:41:37.642
You're just like me.

00:41:37.726 --> 00:41:39.811
-Well done. Congrats!
-Knock it off.

00:41:39.894 --> 00:41:40.770
Eat up.

00:41:40.854 --> 00:41:43.023
So, you officially became a couple today?

00:41:43.106 --> 00:41:46.109
When's your anniversary?
When is your 100-day anniversary?

00:41:46.192 --> 00:41:47.360
I don't know.

00:41:53.616 --> 00:41:56.286
How could a teacher
who's supposed to teach students

00:41:56.369 --> 00:41:57.912
date a parent?

00:41:58.663 --> 00:41:59.581
Does this make sense?

00:41:59.664 --> 00:42:01.374
It doesn't make any sense.

00:42:01.458 --> 00:42:05.337
From a moral and ethical standpoint,
this is unacceptable, isn't it?

00:42:06.338 --> 00:42:08.757
Principal, wouldn't you agree?

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:12.927
Well, the school needs to be cautious
about these matters,

00:42:13.011 --> 00:42:16.514
but Ms. Bom isn't the type
to do anything wrong.

00:42:16.598 --> 00:42:17.640
Yes, I agree.

00:42:17.724 --> 00:42:20.477
And Han-gyul's uncle
may have looked rough at first,

00:42:20.935 --> 00:42:22.937
but don't we all know
what he's really like now?

00:42:23.563 --> 00:42:25.607
Yes, he's raising Han-gyul well

00:42:25.690 --> 00:42:27.317
and taking good care of the elders.

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:29.486
Plus, the CEO of JQ Energy
is Sun Jae-gyu, right?

00:42:29.569 --> 00:42:30.862
Snap out of it!

00:42:31.654 --> 00:42:34.824
Look at this.
Didn't I tell you how I got this scar?

00:42:35.492 --> 00:42:36.785
You've all lost your minds.

00:42:36.868 --> 00:42:40.455
How can you possibly fall for that thug
and take sides with him?

00:42:40.538 --> 00:42:43.458
I swear, just hearing his name
makes my blood boil.

00:42:43.541 --> 00:42:44.834
I feel sick to my stomach.

00:42:45.502 --> 00:42:49.589
He's tall as a beanpole,
and he looks full of lust.

00:42:52.759 --> 00:42:53.593
Yoon Bom.

00:42:54.344 --> 00:42:56.096
You've been through worse in Seoul.

00:42:58.014 --> 00:42:59.891
All you'll get are bruises.

00:43:00.975 --> 00:43:02.227
Stand up tall.

00:43:02.811 --> 00:43:03.853
Brace your core.

00:43:22.747 --> 00:43:23.581
Ms. Bom.

00:43:24.874 --> 00:43:27.710
Do you know why
we have to maintain distance from parents?

00:43:29.087 --> 00:43:31.840
Once you start
getting personally involved with parents,

00:43:31.923 --> 00:43:34.259
you end up favoring one child,

00:43:34.342 --> 00:43:38.972
and the damage inevitably falls
on the other students. That's my point.

00:43:39.597 --> 00:43:40.515
Do you understand?

00:43:41.057 --> 00:43:44.561
But you favor Choi Se-jin so much,
Mr. Hong.

00:43:47.313 --> 00:43:48.606
What are you talking about?

00:43:50.275 --> 00:43:53.027
When have I ever favored her?

00:43:53.111 --> 00:43:53.945
Don't you remember?

00:43:54.988 --> 00:43:57.699
You helped Choi Se-jin's dad
with his election,

00:43:57.782 --> 00:43:59.075
emceed campaign events,

00:43:59.909 --> 00:44:02.704
and threw yourself
into whatever the governor's doing.

00:44:03.288 --> 00:44:06.541
Doesn't that count as getting
personally involved with parents?

00:44:06.624 --> 00:44:09.169
No, that's not the same thing.

00:44:09.252 --> 00:44:13.590
I was simply lending a small hand
to public service.

00:44:13.673 --> 00:44:15.425
You're taking it the wrong way.

00:44:16.342 --> 00:44:18.052
In a backwater town like this,

00:44:18.136 --> 00:44:20.930
where you can barely find anyone under 50,

00:44:21.014 --> 00:44:24.601
if two young people start dating,
you should quietly be happy for them.

00:44:24.684 --> 00:44:28.104
Why are you making such a fuss
like it's some huge scandal?

00:44:28.188 --> 00:44:30.273
Did Ms. Bom have an affair?

00:44:30.356 --> 00:44:32.525
Did she cheat on someone?

00:44:41.618 --> 00:44:42.494
Ms. Bom.

00:44:44.245 --> 00:44:46.456
If there's someone you like, go for it.

00:44:46.539 --> 00:44:49.417
If you want to be with someone,
don't hold back and be with him.

00:44:52.003 --> 00:44:54.839
Spring may seem like it'll last forever,

00:44:54.923 --> 00:44:56.174
but it's gone in a blink.

00:45:00.678 --> 00:45:02.931
Live your life in full bloom, okay?

00:45:09.354 --> 00:45:11.064
Thank you, Ms. Seo.

00:45:14.484 --> 00:45:15.360
And... (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:45:17.278 --> 00:45:19.989
I'm sorry for any concern
I've caused, teachers.

00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:23.535
I'm fully aware of the concerns you have.

00:45:23.618 --> 00:45:26.371
However, I will never do anything shameful
in front of the students

00:45:26.955 --> 00:45:29.541
or neglect my responsibilities
as an educator.

00:45:29.624 --> 00:45:31.876
I assure you that such a thing
will never happen.

00:45:33.836 --> 00:45:35.505
I promise that, under any circumstances,

00:45:35.588 --> 00:45:37.840
I will not cause any trouble
for the school.

00:45:38.841 --> 00:45:42.762
So please trust me this once
and give me a chance.

00:45:44.514 --> 00:45:45.932
I'd appreciate your support.

00:46:05.702 --> 00:46:06.536
Ms. Bom.

00:46:08.997 --> 00:46:11.499
Have you been waiting for me?
What if someone saw you?

00:46:11.583 --> 00:46:13.209
Most people have already seen us.

00:46:15.461 --> 00:46:16.379
Right.

00:46:17.213 --> 00:46:18.423
We've already been busted.

00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:21.718
I was waiting for you
since I was so anxious.

00:46:21.801 --> 00:46:24.220
How was it at school? Was everything okay?

00:46:24.929 --> 00:46:27.056
I did my best to explain.

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.728
Now I have to brace myself
for whatever comes next.

00:46:31.811 --> 00:46:33.771
You don't need
to brace yourself for anything.

00:46:34.355 --> 00:46:36.649
If anything were to happen to you,

00:46:37.317 --> 00:46:40.361
I'll do whatever it takes to handle it.

00:46:40.945 --> 00:46:42.530
So don't worry about anything at all.

00:46:42.614 --> 00:46:45.033
Just stay calm and relaxed, okay?

00:46:45.783 --> 00:46:48.202
Cover your ears, close your eyes,

00:46:48.286 --> 00:46:50.038
and just keep smiling, all right?

00:46:51.122 --> 00:46:52.248
That's all, okay?

00:47:00.089 --> 00:47:02.842
The whole town knows about us now anyway.
Who cares?

00:47:03.551 --> 00:47:04.510
Today, let's...

00:47:05.136 --> 00:47:06.054
Don't smile.

00:47:06.137 --> 00:47:07.388
...smile as much as we can.

00:47:07.472 --> 00:47:08.765
Don't have fun.

00:47:08.848 --> 00:47:10.600
Let's have fun, like crazy.

00:47:10.683 --> 00:47:12.060
Don't be happy.

00:47:12.143 --> 00:47:13.686
Let's be as happy as we can

00:47:14.395 --> 00:47:16.981
and go to places we wanted to go
but couldn't before,

00:47:17.607 --> 00:47:19.901
without holding back, okay?

00:47:27.241 --> 00:47:28.368
Let's go.

00:47:57.188 --> 00:48:00.650
BOM LOVES JAE-GYU

00:48:12.995 --> 00:48:14.414
Ready? Smile.

00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:18.042
One, two, three.

00:48:28.886 --> 00:48:35.643
-One, two.
-One, two.

00:48:35.727 --> 00:48:37.979
-One, two.
-Hi.

00:48:45.695 --> 00:48:47.613
SASHIMI AND KING CRAB

00:48:54.704 --> 00:48:56.497
Here, Ms. Bom. Open up.

00:48:59.917 --> 00:49:01.002
How is it?

00:49:03.463 --> 00:49:06.132
This is absolutely mouthwatering.
Try some.

00:49:15.099 --> 00:49:15.975
How is it?

00:49:16.058 --> 00:49:18.102
It's so plump and sweet.

00:49:18.186 --> 00:49:19.020
Right?

00:49:19.103 --> 00:49:21.022
My tongue is crying tears of joy.

00:49:21.105 --> 00:49:22.982
Good grief, I can't watch this.

00:49:23.065 --> 00:49:25.359
What on earth are they doing
with each hand?

00:49:25.985 --> 00:49:27.570
Diving straight into the shell.

00:49:28.696 --> 00:49:29.614
It looks so good.

00:49:29.697 --> 00:49:33.034
I guess their other hands are busy
doing something else.

00:49:34.744 --> 00:49:35.995
Get in there.

00:49:36.746 --> 00:49:38.831
It's so plump. Wow.

00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:41.375
What? With a parent?

00:49:43.586 --> 00:49:45.338
Hasn't she still come to her senses

00:49:45.421 --> 00:49:47.673
or is she deliberately
trying to drive me crazy?

00:49:47.757 --> 00:49:49.383
After going through that mess here,

00:49:49.467 --> 00:49:52.053
how could she go there
and get involved with a parent again?

00:49:52.136 --> 00:49:53.763
I have no excuse.

00:49:53.846 --> 00:49:56.098
I should have watched more closely.

00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:03.439
Who is this guy anyway? What does he do?

00:50:04.607 --> 00:50:08.069
It just so happens I know him...

00:50:10.988 --> 00:50:14.909
Could it be
that jerk you've been looking for?

00:50:14.992 --> 00:50:20.039
That dumb thug who's all muscle
and ran off with your money?

00:50:26.754 --> 00:50:28.172
Honey, my meds.

00:50:28.256 --> 00:50:29.841
Yes, sure.

00:50:41.018 --> 00:50:44.105
Manager, cancel my entire schedule
for next week.

00:50:45.356 --> 00:50:47.483
You're not seriously going, are you?

00:50:48.317 --> 00:50:49.735
Ms. Jeong, calm down.

00:50:49.819 --> 00:50:52.989
Doing this could backfire on Ms. Bom.

00:50:53.072 --> 00:50:55.908
This whole mess is your fault,
and you're telling me to calm down?

00:51:00.788 --> 00:51:05.042
I should've gone down to Shinsu
to talk to Bom myself back then.

00:51:05.626 --> 00:51:08.880
Whether I go there and drag her back
or cut ties for good,

00:51:09.505 --> 00:51:11.048
I'm settling this once and for all.

00:51:11.132 --> 00:51:13.426
So both of you, stay out of it.

00:51:14.844 --> 00:51:16.262
From here on out, I'll handle it.

00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:40.953
You should go now.

00:51:41.787 --> 00:51:43.623
Okay, go on inside.

00:51:45.458 --> 00:51:47.710
I think I can only go if you let go.

00:51:49.754 --> 00:51:50.588
I should let go.

00:51:51.130 --> 00:51:52.673
Yes, let go.

00:51:55.843 --> 00:51:58.471
Why won't my hand let go?

00:51:58.554 --> 00:51:59.722
I know.

00:52:00.556 --> 00:52:01.891
Strangely, it's stuck.

00:52:03.768 --> 00:52:04.769
Then I have no choice.

00:52:05.394 --> 00:52:07.813
I'll walk you to the front door
and then go.

00:52:27.208 --> 00:52:28.292
What's going on?

00:52:28.876 --> 00:52:29.961
It's still stuck.

00:52:31.754 --> 00:52:33.714
Did we hold on for too long?

00:52:34.548 --> 00:52:36.050
In that case,

00:52:36.133 --> 00:52:40.846
I'll just walk you to your bedroom door,
and then I'll leave for real.

00:52:48.562 --> 00:52:50.356
You didn't just walk me to the door.

00:52:51.732 --> 00:52:54.610
You brought me inside the room.

00:52:56.654 --> 00:52:58.948
I don't think there's anywhere else to go.

00:53:02.284 --> 00:53:03.160
Right.

00:53:07.999 --> 00:53:10.251
I let go. It came off.

00:53:10.751 --> 00:53:13.170
We managed to let go, didn't we?

00:53:13.921 --> 00:53:15.047
Right.

00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:16.674
We let go.

00:53:16.757 --> 00:53:19.969
Don't step out, it's late.
I'll go by myself.

00:53:30.604 --> 00:53:31.439
Ms. Bom.

00:53:33.357 --> 00:53:35.484
Did you just stop me from leaving?

00:53:35.568 --> 00:53:37.069
Me? When?

00:53:39.196 --> 00:53:41.323
Maybe you got caught on the doorknob.

00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:47.329
There's no doorknob here.

00:53:48.205 --> 00:53:51.208
Then was it a nail? Or maybe a hanger?

00:53:56.964 --> 00:54:00.634
I thought maybe
you didn't want me to leave.

00:54:00.718 --> 00:54:02.344
Who? Me?

00:54:03.971 --> 00:54:08.267
So, are you saying you want me to leave?

00:54:09.268 --> 00:54:11.062
Why would you say that?

00:54:11.145 --> 00:54:15.483
I'm just saying that your clothes
probably got caught on something.

00:54:16.108 --> 00:54:18.444
It doesn't mean I wanted you to leave.

00:54:18.527 --> 00:54:23.115
So, you mean you wanted me to stay?

00:54:23.199 --> 00:54:26.243
Well, it's not like
I specifically wanted you to stay.

00:54:27.369 --> 00:54:28.204
I see.

00:54:30.289 --> 00:54:31.373
But...

00:54:33.417 --> 00:54:38.714
on second thought,
maybe staying isn't such a bad idea.

00:54:40.424 --> 00:54:41.550
Maybe you should go today.

00:54:43.385 --> 00:54:44.220
I see.

00:54:47.139 --> 00:54:48.599
What I mean is...

00:54:49.725 --> 00:54:52.311
I want to be with you,

00:54:52.978 --> 00:54:54.980
but at the same time,
I feel like we shouldn't.

00:54:55.064 --> 00:54:57.066
It's not like I want you to leave,

00:54:57.149 --> 00:54:59.151
but maybe leaving is the right thing,
you know...

00:55:02.113 --> 00:55:05.658
If you can't decide, I will.

00:55:14.625 --> 00:55:15.459
Han-gyul.

00:55:16.627 --> 00:55:18.129
I can't come home tonight.

00:57:08.948 --> 00:57:10.866
BOM-SIK'S HOUSE

00:57:33.222 --> 00:57:34.390
Did you sleep well?

00:57:36.183 --> 00:57:40.145
Yes. I think I slept well.

00:57:44.316 --> 00:57:47.444
Glad to hear it. I slept well too.

00:57:50.823 --> 00:57:53.617
Why is that vase there?

00:57:53.701 --> 00:57:54.535
Wait.

00:57:55.286 --> 00:57:57.413
Stay in bed a little more. I'll clean up.

00:58:45.294 --> 00:58:48.088
44-5 HAEEUN-GIL, SHINSU-EUP, JUAN-GUN,
GYEONGSANGBUK-DO

00:59:43.685 --> 00:59:46.939
I'll find out what kind of person
that Sun Jae-gyu guy really is.

00:59:47.564 --> 00:59:49.274
Jae-gyu. Oh, my!

00:59:50.442 --> 00:59:51.402
Why are you here, Mom?

00:59:51.485 --> 00:59:52.903
-You have a kid.
-He's my nephew.

00:59:52.986 --> 00:59:55.197
How could you meet a guy like this
in a nowhere town?

00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:57.408
Ms. Jeong.

00:59:58.742 --> 01:00:01.787
Ms. Bom, listen carefully
to what I'm about to say.

01:00:01.870 --> 01:00:03.372
Who are you, following me like this?

01:00:04.248 --> 01:00:05.374
Ms. Bom!

01:00:05.457 --> 01:00:09.044
Han-gyul's uncle got hit by a car
and has been taken to the hospital.

01:00:14.341 --> 01:00:16.343
