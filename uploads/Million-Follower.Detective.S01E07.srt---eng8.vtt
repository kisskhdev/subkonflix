WITCH BABA

00:00:12.083 --> 00:00:16.041
Last time, I predicted someone
would fall from a footbridge and die.

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:17.916
It actually came true.

00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.750
Is everyone excited for lunch tomorrow?

00:00:28.375 --> 00:00:29.375
…tomorrow…

00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:31.666
…tomorrow…

00:00:35.125 --> 00:00:38.083
Tomorrow, at KOL STAGE…

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:41.125
Who says you have to eat pomelos
during the Mid-Autumn Festival?

00:00:43.541 --> 00:00:45.375
DIE, TING-YU

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.083
Hello, everyone.

00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:55.041
Here's the next prediction.

00:00:55.125 --> 00:00:58.250
Tomorrow, at KOL STAGE,

00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:02.083
Ting-yu will die.

00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.416

FANG CHUN-JONG,
LIU HSIAO-LI, LI I-JU, HSU HUI-CHEN

00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:07.916
Mr. Jen.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.041
Alright.

00:02:10.541 --> 00:02:11.625
I'll go.

00:02:11.708 --> 00:02:13.083
Take them to the precinct.

00:02:15.125 --> 00:02:17.500
-Thank you, A-Hua.
-Where are you going?

00:02:18.208 --> 00:02:19.541
With Mr. Jen. I have to--

00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:23.750
Get in the car. Why are you following him?
You'll only mess things up if you go.

00:02:23.833 --> 00:02:24.666
Get in the car.

00:02:25.666 --> 00:02:26.750
Put them in the car.

00:02:27.875 --> 00:02:28.708
Hurry up.

00:02:30.916 --> 00:02:31.916
-Move.
-Let's go.

00:02:39.916 --> 00:02:40.833
Get in.

00:03:01.875 --> 00:03:03.625
Are you really following orders?

00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:06.500
What else can I do?

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.541
Kuo Ta-fu said I'm gonna die tomorrow.

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:21.666
Will you save me again?

00:03:24.708 --> 00:03:25.791
Tomorrow, at KOL STAGE…

00:03:25.875 --> 00:03:27.583
SHE DIDN'T EVEN DRAW ANY CARDS

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.125
-It's fake.
-It's edited.

00:03:30.208 --> 00:03:32.041
Yeah, I'm going. It's gonna be lit.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.375
-She's brutal.
-Hilarious.

00:03:35.458 --> 00:03:36.583
Why is that familiar?

00:03:36.666 --> 00:03:38.541
-The cops gave up.
-What do you know?

00:03:38.625 --> 00:03:40.166
-Go Ting-yu!
-Go, Witch Baba!

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.291
Take your mask off!

00:03:41.375 --> 00:03:43.250
Looking for two KOL STAGE tickets.

00:03:43.333 --> 00:03:44.250
How much are they?

00:03:44.833 --> 00:03:46.041
They're 6,000 NTD now.

00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:47.541
No way. Is it really 6,000?

00:03:48.166 --> 00:03:49.166
They're sold out.

00:03:50.083 --> 00:03:51.916
It's over 30,000 a ticket.

00:03:52.875 --> 00:03:55.208
OCTOBER 6TH

00:04:17.875 --> 00:04:19.166
Ting-yu is the coolest.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.708
Ting-yu.

00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:27.125
Keep moving.

00:04:27.208 --> 00:04:29.500
-Please keep moving.
-Keep moving.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.125
TAIPEI CITY FIRST PRECINCT

00:04:36.458 --> 00:04:37.458
Is that Ting-yu?

00:04:37.541 --> 00:04:39.041
That's a celebrity van.

00:04:39.125 --> 00:04:42.958
Ting-yu.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.416
Ting-yu.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Ting-yu!

00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.500
You, take that mask off!

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.500
Hey, you! Freeze!

00:05:04.666 --> 00:05:06.083
What are you doing?

00:05:07.708 --> 00:05:09.208
Why are you wearing a mask?

00:05:09.291 --> 00:05:11.250
They're giving them out at the station.

00:05:12.708 --> 00:05:13.958
Please show your QR code.

00:05:14.875 --> 00:05:15.875
Yes…

00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.416
Sure, you can take a sticker.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.750
Feel free to take one.

00:05:20.083 --> 00:05:22.125
No problem. Please keep moving.

00:05:22.208 --> 00:05:24.541
Next in line, please show your QR code.

00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:26.875
Kuo Ta-fu!

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:33.583
Move.

00:05:34.375 --> 00:05:35.500
-What?
-It's crowded.

00:05:35.583 --> 00:05:36.750
Stop pushing!

00:05:37.833 --> 00:05:39.041
What are you doing?

00:05:39.125 --> 00:05:40.625
-Move.
-What?

00:05:45.375 --> 00:05:46.750
Hey, stop him.

00:05:46.833 --> 00:05:48.083
Who is that guy?

00:05:48.166 --> 00:05:49.083
Stop him.

00:05:49.166 --> 00:05:50.416
Stop all of them.

00:05:51.541 --> 00:05:54.458
-Excuse me.
-Chia-jen. The venue is surrounded.

00:05:54.541 --> 00:05:57.541
-They can get in, but not out.
-It's about to start.

00:05:57.625 --> 00:05:59.083
Your team's in position, too.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.791
How's my hair and makeup?

00:06:02.875 --> 00:06:03.791
You look great.

00:06:03.875 --> 00:06:05.416
Hey, did you see that video?

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.458
Yes, it was scary.

00:06:06.541 --> 00:06:09.375
Don't you think her video
was edited so well?

00:06:09.458 --> 00:06:10.458
That's a good point.

00:06:10.541 --> 00:06:11.583
Yeah, and I've been…

00:06:11.666 --> 00:06:13.666
Hey, Braised Egg, quick question.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.791
-Do you think Ting-yu will show up?
-Of course not.

00:06:16.875 --> 00:06:19.083
You never know.

00:06:19.166 --> 00:06:20.750
-I think he will.
-No way.

00:06:20.833 --> 00:06:22.583
He has a meet-and-greet today.

00:06:25.541 --> 00:06:26.375
Who's this?

00:06:26.458 --> 00:06:27.500
Yo! Yo!

00:07:14.333 --> 00:07:19.125
Ting-yu…

00:07:29.375 --> 00:07:31.708
-What's going on?
-It's not time yet, right?

00:07:31.791 --> 00:07:32.958
I didn't do this.

00:07:34.666 --> 00:07:35.875
Everything's frozen.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.791
WITCH BABA

00:07:48.291 --> 00:07:50.791
Welcome to KOL STAGE.

00:07:50.875 --> 00:07:52.541
I'm Witch Baba.

00:07:52.625 --> 00:07:55.208
Witch Baba…

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.375
Can you trace the signal?

00:07:57.458 --> 00:08:00.541
The internet has been cut off.
It's connected to the screen.

00:08:02.125 --> 00:08:03.333
He's here, then.

00:08:03.416 --> 00:08:06.416
Thank you for coming to support
influencers at a time like this.

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.916
You all know that four influencers
caused several deaths

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.583
and you still showed up.

00:08:11.666 --> 00:08:14.541
That makes you all brainless fans.

00:08:22.625 --> 00:08:23.458
Move. Excuse me.

00:08:23.541 --> 00:08:25.416
-Move.
-Let us through.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.791
Don't push.

00:08:27.916 --> 00:08:28.875
Let us through.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.166
-But don't worry, guys.
-Move.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.500
I killed those four scumbags.

00:08:35.583 --> 00:08:37.125
One drowned.

00:08:37.208 --> 00:08:38.791
One fell to their death.

00:08:38.875 --> 00:08:41.500
One's in critical condition
at the hospital.

00:08:42.333 --> 00:08:43.458
By the way,

00:08:43.541 --> 00:08:46.291
the last one is about to die.

00:08:47.583 --> 00:08:50.208
Baba…

00:08:50.875 --> 00:08:53.708
You all came here
to see Ting-yu die, right?

00:08:53.791 --> 00:08:55.875
Typing away behind your keyboards

00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.708
is enough to get people killed.

00:08:57.791 --> 00:08:59.958
It has nothing to do with you guys, right?

00:09:00.041 --> 00:09:02.541
You just click the like button, right?

00:09:03.583 --> 00:09:05.541
This is hilarious.

00:09:05.625 --> 00:09:07.666
-Such brainless fans.
-What's she saying?

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:10.500
-What does that mean?
-She called us "brainless fans."

00:09:10.583 --> 00:09:12.333
Brainless? Why?

00:09:12.916 --> 00:09:14.833
You're just brainless.

00:09:15.541 --> 00:09:18.583
Brainless fans
create brainless influencers,

00:09:18.666 --> 00:09:21.458
which created this brainless online world.

00:09:21.541 --> 00:09:22.875
That's fantastic!

00:09:24.083 --> 00:09:25.833
Stop hiding behind your keyboards.

00:09:25.916 --> 00:09:28.125
Show everyone what you look like.

00:09:29.083 --> 00:09:31.708
You can all go to hell.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.416
I'm shocked.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:37.833
Can she even do this?

00:09:37.916 --> 00:09:39.041
I see myself.

00:09:39.125 --> 00:09:41.458
-Should we call the police?
-Show yourself!

00:09:41.541 --> 00:09:43.500
Shut it off. Why won't it turn off?

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:44.625
Why are you hiding?

00:09:44.708 --> 00:09:46.250
I can't control it from here.

00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.416
What the fuck!

00:09:49.583 --> 00:09:50.666
Show yourself!

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:51.916
The killer is here.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.541
-Find him now.
-Show yourself!

00:09:53.625 --> 00:09:55.083
Come out now!

00:09:56.125 --> 00:09:58.875
You're shameless! Show yourself!

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.916
What the fuck is that?

00:10:03.708 --> 00:10:05.666
This is messed up.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.500
Has she lost her mind?

00:10:07.583 --> 00:10:08.750
This will cause a riot.

00:10:08.833 --> 00:10:10.250
What do we do?

00:10:10.333 --> 00:10:11.166
She's crazy.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:12.083
Did you see it?

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:13.708
-See what?
-Ting-yu!

00:10:13.791 --> 00:10:15.541
-What?
-Ting-yu walked past.

00:10:15.625 --> 00:10:17.750
-He did?
-The real Ting-yu!

00:10:17.833 --> 00:10:19.541
-In the elevator?
-Go after him!

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.083
-You idiot.
-Don't push me!

00:10:23.583 --> 00:10:24.666
Show yourself!

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.458
Come out now!

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.166
Stop hiding back there, show your face!

00:10:35.708 --> 00:10:36.583
Hello?

00:10:40.375 --> 00:10:42.083
That's not the real Witch Baba.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:44.333
Ting-yu!

00:10:44.916 --> 00:10:45.791
How dare you?

00:10:45.875 --> 00:10:48.000
You're the last person to tell anyone off!

00:10:48.083 --> 00:10:49.750
Ting-yu!

00:10:52.416 --> 00:10:54.083
What do we do? Plug it back in?

00:10:54.166 --> 00:10:55.166
Hurry up!

00:11:04.083 --> 00:11:05.250
-Okay.
-It's your fault.

00:11:05.333 --> 00:11:07.000
I'm gonna die today anyway.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:08.916
Go to hell!

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.916
Before I die, I have something to say.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.041
She's the brainless one.

00:11:13.125 --> 00:11:14.500
Get off the stage!

00:11:14.583 --> 00:11:15.500
Get off the stage.

00:11:16.375 --> 00:11:19.041
The reason for these serial killings is…

00:11:20.708 --> 00:11:21.916
Killer!

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.416
What are you doing?

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.500
A year ago,

00:11:24.583 --> 00:11:27.666
Wei Yen, Wa Tsai, Kao Pi, and I
caused a car accident.

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:29.541
Fuck! This guy's an influencer?

00:11:29.625 --> 00:11:31.875
We honestly thought
it wasn't that serious.

00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.000
You thought so?

00:11:33.083 --> 00:11:35.041
But the accident still happened.

00:11:35.125 --> 00:11:37.416
-You've got some nerve.
-How dare you.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.041
And people died.

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:43.041
I want to apologize to the victims…

00:11:43.833 --> 00:11:45.500
the victims' families.

00:11:46.291 --> 00:11:47.333
Wei Yen…

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:49.416
Wa Tsai…

00:11:50.083 --> 00:11:51.041
Kao Pi…

00:11:51.125 --> 00:11:52.583
and all the influencers.

00:11:53.291 --> 00:11:54.333
I'm sorry.

00:11:54.416 --> 00:11:56.291
It's too late.

00:11:56.375 --> 00:11:57.875
It won't do anything.

00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.625
What I did was wrong. I'm sorry!

00:12:00.208 --> 00:12:01.458
Come down!

00:12:05.416 --> 00:12:06.416
Get off the stage!

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.125
-Come down!
-Off the stage!

00:12:08.208 --> 00:12:09.083
Come down!

00:12:09.166 --> 00:12:11.416
-That was badass.
-Awesome!

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.916
Did the cops make him say that?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.458
That's so cool.

00:12:14.541 --> 00:12:15.416
Off the stage!

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.916
I will cooperate
with the police investigation…

00:12:19.791 --> 00:12:21.625
and accept the judicial ruling.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.333
So please, everyone.

00:12:24.416 --> 00:12:26.083
Just hear me out, okay?

00:12:26.166 --> 00:12:27.916
-No!
-What are you gonna say?

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.250
Get down! We don't wanna hear it!

00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:31.958
Get off the stage…

00:12:32.041 --> 00:12:33.875
Witch Baba has nothing to do with this.

00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.333
Ting-yu!

00:12:35.416 --> 00:12:37.375
She's a victim, too!

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.208
-The real killer…
-Come down!

00:12:43.083 --> 00:12:44.833
…wanted revenge on all of us.

00:12:46.125 --> 00:12:48.250
For all influencers to pay the price.

00:12:49.083 --> 00:12:51.666
He kidnapped Witch Baba's friend.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:54.750
He forced her to make fake predictions.

00:12:55.333 --> 00:12:58.541
He's been holding her hostage
for over a week.

00:12:58.625 --> 00:13:00.166
Who is it?

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:04.000
-Say it!
-Yes, go ahead…

00:13:04.083 --> 00:13:06.666
So here's what I wanna say to the killer.

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:07.875
What do you wanna say?

00:13:08.458 --> 00:13:09.416
I'm sorry…

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:14.250
that I hurt your family.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.791
But the person you kidnapped is innocent.

00:13:20.708 --> 00:13:22.583
What you're doing is wrong.

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:25.625
If you really want revenge…

00:13:28.916 --> 00:13:30.375
come at me, if you dare!

00:13:34.375 --> 00:13:35.416
I'm waiting for you!

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.791
Come down, Ting-yu!

00:13:39.875 --> 00:13:41.291
Come at me!

00:13:45.083 --> 00:13:46.375
I'm waiting for you here!

00:13:46.458 --> 00:13:48.125
Come at me if you dare!

00:13:51.333 --> 00:13:53.000
Keep your word.

00:13:56.708 --> 00:13:57.541
How dare you?

00:13:58.125 --> 00:13:59.500
You've got some nerve.

00:14:00.083 --> 00:14:01.625
Baba and I are waiting for you!

00:14:09.333 --> 00:14:10.166
We're here.

00:14:11.708 --> 00:14:13.583
Baba and I are waiting for you here!

00:14:16.416 --> 00:14:17.583
What are you doing?

00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:20.125
What's going on?

00:14:20.208 --> 00:14:22.291
Why is he saying that on stage?

00:14:22.375 --> 00:14:24.208
He was killing it up there.

00:14:24.291 --> 00:14:26.500
-Ting-yu.
-Hey, where… May I ask…

00:14:26.583 --> 00:14:27.958
Where are you going?

00:14:28.041 --> 00:14:29.708
Excuse me.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:45.833
What are you doing?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.041
Who are you to say that crap?

00:15:42.708 --> 00:15:44.791
Who are you to say that crap?

00:15:49.333 --> 00:15:50.458
You…

00:15:57.750 --> 00:15:59.916
Ting-yu, go!

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Go!

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:28.750
Police!

00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.791
What was that?
Why did he leave after the speech?

00:16:35.875 --> 00:16:36.833
Where's Ting-yu?

00:16:37.458 --> 00:16:38.750
-Here.
-He's in there.

00:16:48.041 --> 00:16:49.166
Go on, shoot.

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:50.375
Two lives.

00:16:59.708 --> 00:17:01.666
Hey.

00:17:03.083 --> 00:17:04.083
How did this happen?

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.708
Hey, Ting-yu. Get up.

00:17:08.291 --> 00:17:09.375
Let's go downstairs.

00:17:09.875 --> 00:17:13.041
The door's locked. I can't go after him.
They went downstairs.

00:17:13.666 --> 00:17:16.625
Hello?
Is there anyone downstairs we can call?

00:17:18.666 --> 00:17:19.791
Yes, stop them.

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:55.458
Kuo Ta-fu!

00:17:59.916 --> 00:18:01.250
Fuck.

00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:04.250
Get out!

00:18:24.375 --> 00:18:25.500
Stop the car!

00:18:26.291 --> 00:18:27.125
Stop!

00:19:17.666 --> 00:19:19.208
Where's my daughter?

00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:20.375
Where's…

00:19:22.041 --> 00:19:23.666
What about my daughter?

00:19:28.041 --> 00:19:29.125
My…

00:19:32.083 --> 00:19:33.125
My daughter!

00:19:34.125 --> 00:19:35.416
She's dead.

00:19:40.291 --> 00:19:42.750
-Where's my daughter?
-She's dead.

00:20:12.458 --> 00:20:15.333
The next song is for my dad.

00:20:15.833 --> 00:20:17.083
He's not here today.

00:20:17.166 --> 00:20:18.791
Good thing he isn't.

00:20:20.833 --> 00:20:22.708
My dad's a police officer.

00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:28.333
He's one of those boring old men.

00:20:31.416 --> 00:20:34.916
To him, the Internet is only for
sending Boomer greeting images.

00:20:36.375 --> 00:20:38.416
So he's really against me
being an influencer.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.583
He's even more against me being a singer.

00:20:45.666 --> 00:20:48.666
He always asks,"Why are you streaming?"

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:50.791
"Is the Internet that fun?"

00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:52.541
It actually is that fun.

00:20:55.625 --> 00:20:57.875
I got into a big fight with my dad.

00:20:57.958 --> 00:21:00.083
I even reported him to the police.

00:21:00.791 --> 00:21:03.250
I got him a disciplinary warning.
True story.

00:21:07.416 --> 00:21:09.791
I haven't seen my dad for over a year.

00:21:10.625 --> 00:21:13.541
Over the past year,
I haven't wanted to see him.

00:21:14.916 --> 00:21:17.833
But today, I really wish he were here.

00:21:19.208 --> 00:21:21.125
I want him to know…

00:21:22.125 --> 00:21:24.083
Breathe in.

00:21:24.166 --> 00:21:26.541
…that many lovely things still exist.

00:21:27.541 --> 00:21:30.500
-Let's breathe in.
-Breathe in.

00:21:30.583 --> 00:21:31.666
Breathe out.

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:33.791
Seeing everyone around when I'm down…

00:21:33.875 --> 00:21:35.291
Request backup. Call 911.

00:21:35.375 --> 00:21:37.375
Knowing I'm not alone

00:21:37.458 --> 00:21:38.583
feels warm inside.

00:21:38.666 --> 00:21:39.666
Requesting backup.

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:41.666
557 East stairwell, requesting backup.

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:43.833
Ting-yu, don't die.

00:21:48.791 --> 00:21:50.958
I suddenly feel like crying.

00:21:51.625 --> 00:21:53.000
I want a hug.

00:21:57.083 --> 00:21:59.791
I want to hug my daughter, too!

00:22:47.291 --> 00:22:48.208
Dad.

00:22:49.291 --> 00:22:50.583
I'm doing very well.

00:22:54.541 --> 00:22:56.875
I finally found what I want to do.

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.083
And I'm having a lot of fun.

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.041
If, someday,

00:23:05.125 --> 00:23:07.416
I get myself into trouble…

00:23:09.333 --> 00:23:11.958
or if I end up somewhere far away…

00:23:40.708 --> 00:23:42.375
please come find me.

00:24:31.208 --> 00:24:32.416
Come in.

00:24:34.416 --> 00:24:35.416
Chen Yu-chieh.

00:24:37.083 --> 00:24:38.375
Li Ting-en.

00:24:40.291 --> 00:24:41.375
-Can I hug you?
-Yes.

00:24:41.458 --> 00:24:42.500
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.708
I missed you so much.

00:24:44.791 --> 00:24:46.416
I'm sorry.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:47.750
Why are you apologizing?

00:24:48.333 --> 00:24:50.291
You were locked up because of me.

00:24:51.333 --> 00:24:53.166
You really think you're Witch Baba?

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:54.458
Hey.

00:24:54.541 --> 00:24:56.458
-You've got some nerve.
-Ouch!

00:24:56.958 --> 00:24:58.916
-What's wrong?
-It hurts.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.583
You're totally fine.

00:25:02.666 --> 00:25:04.500
Did he do anything to you?

00:25:05.416 --> 00:25:06.708
No.

00:25:07.458 --> 00:25:09.958
I was actually kept in a separate room.

00:25:10.041 --> 00:25:12.291
I don't think he could even look at me.

00:25:12.375 --> 00:25:13.958
-Really?
-Yes.

00:25:14.041 --> 00:25:15.125
Why?

00:25:17.208 --> 00:25:19.041
I'm not sure. It was just a feeling.

00:25:20.583 --> 00:25:22.458
He said he had a daughter.

00:25:22.958 --> 00:25:25.791
Maybe I remind him of her.

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:28.958
That's so twisted.

00:25:32.291 --> 00:25:33.583
CHEN O CHIEH

00:25:33.666 --> 00:25:34.958
Do you want some?

00:25:35.625 --> 00:25:37.166
-You go ahead.
-Okay.

00:25:38.125 --> 00:25:39.500
Where's your dad?

00:25:39.583 --> 00:25:41.375
How are things between you two?

00:25:41.958 --> 00:25:42.833
I don't know.

00:25:42.916 --> 00:25:45.375
I've only seen him
a few times since I got here.

00:25:45.458 --> 00:25:48.375
He's always in a hurry.
I don't know what he's up to.

00:25:48.458 --> 00:25:50.583
Really? What's keeping him so busy?

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:53.875
No idea. It's good if he's busy.

00:25:53.958 --> 00:25:55.583
I don't know what to say to him.

00:26:00.291 --> 00:26:01.208
Hey.

00:26:01.791 --> 00:26:03.875
I may have told your dad something.

00:26:03.958 --> 00:26:06.875
-What did you tell him?
-That you don't know what to say to him.

00:26:06.958 --> 00:26:08.333
You're such a blabbermouth.

00:26:08.416 --> 00:26:09.666
Hardly.

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:11.958
He asked me why you never go home.

00:26:13.125 --> 00:26:13.958
And then?

00:26:14.625 --> 00:26:16.625
Then your dad said

00:26:16.708 --> 00:26:18.875
he doesn't need you to come home.

00:26:18.958 --> 00:26:20.291
It's just that, as a dad,

00:26:20.375 --> 00:26:21.958
he worries about his daughter.

00:26:23.166 --> 00:26:25.416
He worries if you're eating enough,

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:27.250
if you're sleeping well,

00:26:27.333 --> 00:26:28.916
or if anyone's picking on you.

00:26:31.166 --> 00:26:32.833
Bullshit, he'd never say that.

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.125
It's true.

00:26:35.208 --> 00:26:36.958
How is that possible?

00:26:37.041 --> 00:26:38.541
He even cried while talking.

00:26:38.625 --> 00:26:41.291
Yeah, right. Liar.

00:26:41.875 --> 00:26:43.541
-You're secretly loving this.
-No.

00:26:43.625 --> 00:26:45.041
-Mr. Jen.
-You're still here?

00:26:45.125 --> 00:26:46.250
-Hey.
-What?

00:26:46.333 --> 00:26:47.500
Wasn't that your dad?

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:50.958
Visiting the girls?

00:26:51.041 --> 00:26:51.958
Yes.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.416
-I think so.
-Stop it.

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:55.333
I'll get going.

00:26:55.416 --> 00:26:57.375
-Where are you going? Come back!
-Bye.

00:26:57.958 --> 00:26:59.083
Be nice to your dad.

00:26:59.166 --> 00:27:00.000
Come back.

00:27:08.291 --> 00:27:10.166
-Hi.
-Mr. Chen.

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:11.875
Is she still sleeping?

00:27:11.958 --> 00:27:13.166
I don't know.

00:27:14.791 --> 00:27:15.625
Thank you.

00:27:16.583 --> 00:27:18.083
I'll leave you two alone. Bye.

00:28:49.166 --> 00:28:50.958
That's from the contest I was in.

00:28:54.166 --> 00:28:55.500
Is it too loud?

00:28:57.166 --> 00:28:58.625
Guess what place I got?

00:29:02.916 --> 00:29:03.791
First place.

00:29:12.583 --> 00:29:13.833
Come here.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:19.333
Come on.

00:29:28.625 --> 00:29:30.291
I'm doing very well.

00:29:30.375 --> 00:29:32.000
I eat every day.

00:29:32.083 --> 00:29:33.541
No one's picking on me.

00:29:34.541 --> 00:29:35.666
And if someone does,

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:37.125
I know you'd be there.

00:29:40.541 --> 00:29:42.208
Mom would know that, too.

00:29:43.583 --> 00:29:44.416
Yes.

00:29:50.041 --> 00:29:52.250
Don't smash things up again.

00:29:52.791 --> 00:29:53.625
Okay.

00:29:56.708 --> 00:29:58.166
You're not mad anymore at me?

00:29:58.833 --> 00:29:59.666
I'm not.

00:30:09.333 --> 00:30:10.166
Thank you.

00:30:38.208 --> 00:30:39.791
How long are you gonna sleep?

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.708
Kao Pi and Wa Tsai are dead.

00:30:51.333 --> 00:30:53.375
Our video got people killed.

00:30:58.041 --> 00:31:00.375
We got a pregnant woman
and her baby killed.

00:31:05.375 --> 00:31:07.125
How are you still sleeping?

00:31:25.875 --> 00:31:27.791
Kao Pi's dad is still abroad.

00:31:33.125 --> 00:31:35.875
Wa Tsai's mom hasn't told his grandma yet.

00:31:40.583 --> 00:31:42.583
How do you want me to tell them?

00:32:03.166 --> 00:32:04.833
It's just you and me now.

00:32:15.875 --> 00:32:18.416
Didn't you say
you wanted ten million followers?

00:32:25.708 --> 00:32:28.333
Didn't you say
we'd all live in a big house together?

00:33:27.083 --> 00:33:28.833
This is from your computer.

00:33:28.916 --> 00:33:30.250
Are you okay?

00:33:32.041 --> 00:33:33.583
It's okay. I'm fine.

00:33:35.375 --> 00:33:37.083
Just ignore them.

00:33:38.583 --> 00:33:40.666
This is the version that leaked online.

00:33:41.541 --> 00:33:43.666
I think Ting-yu deleted the original file.

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:44.916
Why do you have it?

00:33:47.333 --> 00:33:48.875
We're running out. Shit.

00:33:48.958 --> 00:33:50.416
Who gave you the video?

00:33:53.125 --> 00:33:53.958
Hey.

00:33:55.291 --> 00:33:56.916
Get his head!

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.916
Shit! He's lighting the big one.

00:33:59.958 --> 00:34:00.791
Shit!

00:34:10.041 --> 00:34:12.458
There should only be one version
on the computer.

00:34:13.083 --> 00:34:15.000
Who gave you the other one?

00:34:18.708 --> 00:34:19.958
Kuo Ta-fu.

00:34:20.458 --> 00:34:22.625
You've already killed two people.

00:34:22.708 --> 00:34:26.000
Under these circumstances,
you're facing two life sentences.

00:34:26.083 --> 00:34:27.375
Please cooperate.

00:34:32.125 --> 00:34:33.416
You gave it to me

00:34:34.333 --> 00:34:35.333
just now.

00:34:42.208 --> 00:34:44.125
So, you didn't upload this video?

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:47.041
You're a fucking cop. Figure it out.

00:34:54.958 --> 00:34:57.041
I'm not the only one who wants them dead.

00:36:58.041 --> 00:36:58.875
Here he is.

00:36:58.958 --> 00:36:59.916
He's here.

00:37:04.583 --> 00:37:07.458
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,

00:37:07.541 --> 00:37:09.083
here's an update.

00:37:10.125 --> 00:37:11.791
Through the efforts

00:37:12.375 --> 00:37:14.125
of our task force,

00:37:15.125 --> 00:37:18.458
we've arrested the main suspect
in the serial killing case, Kuo Ta-fu.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:20.625
He has confessed that

00:37:21.375 --> 00:37:23.375
between September 28th

00:37:23.458 --> 00:37:25.208
and October 6th,

00:37:25.291 --> 00:37:27.708
he committed kidnapping,

00:37:27.791 --> 00:37:28.833
murder,

00:37:28.916 --> 00:37:29.833
police assault,

00:37:29.916 --> 00:37:31.833
and solicitation to commit murder.

00:37:33.166 --> 00:37:34.833
These include

00:37:35.333 --> 00:37:37.541
the kidnapping of Ms. Chen
on September 28th…

00:37:37.625 --> 00:37:39.291
Get away from me!

00:37:40.291 --> 00:37:43.833
the solicitation to murder of Mr. Wei
on October 1st…

00:37:45.958 --> 00:37:48.375
the drowning of Mr. Liu on October 3rd…

00:37:50.375 --> 00:37:53.291
the kidnapping of Mr. Lin on October 4th,

00:37:54.458 --> 00:37:55.583
and the fall

00:37:56.416 --> 00:37:59.083
of Mr. Kao from a footbridge
on October 5th.

00:38:03.458 --> 00:38:07.750
As this case is in the judicial process,
we're unable to disclose further details.

00:38:07.833 --> 00:38:09.166
-Thank you.
-Can you explain…

00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:11.875
We heard Kuo Ta-fu died while in custody.

00:38:11.958 --> 00:38:14.166
What's your response, Captain?

00:38:15.041 --> 00:38:15.875
Yes.

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:19.041
Kuo Ta-fu committed suicide
while in custody.

00:38:19.125 --> 00:38:22.208
Was Kuo's death caused by
Chen Chia-jen's use of excessive force?

00:38:22.291 --> 00:38:24.083
-No.
-He died in custody.

00:38:24.166 --> 00:38:25.833
Isn't the police accountable?

00:38:25.916 --> 00:38:29.791
-This case is in the judicial process.
-Will Wei Meng-yen also commit suicide?

00:38:29.875 --> 00:38:32.166
-Absolutely not.
-Is he in critical condition?

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:33.541
Mr. Wei is now stable

00:38:33.625 --> 00:38:36.625
-and out of danger.
-Has Kuo Ta-fu's motive been confirmed?

00:38:36.708 --> 00:38:38.375
Sorry, we can't comment publicly.

00:38:38.458 --> 00:38:40.416
-Thanks.
-Will Chen Chia-jen be punished?

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:42.708
Will Kuo Ta-fu's car accident case
be pursued?

00:38:43.958 --> 00:38:45.916
The task force
will get to the bottom of it.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.250
Thank you, everyone.

00:38:47.333 --> 00:38:49.125
Sorry, this is in the judicial process.

00:38:49.208 --> 00:38:50.708
That's all for today. Excuse us.

00:38:50.791 --> 00:38:51.625
-This way.
-Thanks.

00:38:51.708 --> 00:38:52.541
Captain…

00:38:52.625 --> 00:38:54.541
Can you say more about the motive?

00:38:54.625 --> 00:38:55.875
-Captain…
-The police…

00:38:55.958 --> 00:38:56.958
Captain.

I'm Witch Baba.

00:39:48.708 --> 00:39:52.708
Even though the serial killing case
seems over…

00:39:59.291 --> 00:40:02.458
there's actually another killer.

00:40:05.833 --> 00:40:08.000
There's one more killer.

00:40:09.458 --> 00:40:11.958
One more person is going to die.

00:44:33.208 --> 00:44:38.208
