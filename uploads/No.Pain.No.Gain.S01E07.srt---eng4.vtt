(This story is purely fictional)

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.750
(Whether or not you have regrets
from the past year,)

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.190
(Success, Joy)
(what awaits us next)

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.470
(Peace)
(will be a spring full of hope.)

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.670
(Out with the old, in with the new.)

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.300
(Here's to a new tomorrow)

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.110
(worth looking forward to.)

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.750
(Hello, tomorrow.)

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.470
It's the 8th day of Chinese New Year.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.270
This can't go on.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.950
We're in a wreck now.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.180
Chen Lei has left.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.390
We're lucky that business

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.390
isn't as bad

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.270
as we first started.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.860
Mr. Li Jr.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.000
- Your favorite fries.
- Thanks.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.070
Some time ago,

00:02:32.324 --> 00:02:33.580
when that singer was around,

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.110
this Internet cafe was booming.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.020
Now that he's gone,

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.700
business is plummeting.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.350
But I heard

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.680
that it was the owner
who made Chen Lei leave,

00:02:42.746 --> 00:02:44.670
and even gave him money
to pursue his dreams.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.390
Why did Pei Qian do that?

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.830
Beats me.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.830
When M&Y was at its peak,

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.700
Xingle couldn't even get
a single customer.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.550
If Pei Qian did this,

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.670
he must have a plan.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.230
I need to prepare before he strikes.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.270
Don't worry, Mr. Li Jr.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.950
They're out of ideas.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.790
This is the best time to attack them.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:07.670
Muyan.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.460
You're not in my position,
so you don't understand.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.550
In commerce, we value peace and harmony.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.830
If we can be friends,
we mustn't be enemies.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.270
We hired a new singer,

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.830
and he's pretty good.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.670
What else can we do?

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.110
Taking them down?

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:34.990
Easy as pie.

Hello?

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.700
Hello, Mr. Pei.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.990
Sorry for disturbing
while you're resting.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.990
But this is important.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.550
Fuhui Group's investment arm

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.670
contacted us,

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.620
hoping to buy out

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.110
our Internet cafe.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.950
I refuse.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.390
Mr. Pei, allow me to explain.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.550
They're not buying Tengda out,

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.270
just the Internet cafe, M&Y.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.140
It's initiated by
one of Fuhui Group's companies,

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.550
Lishi Capital,

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.260
operated by Li Fuhui's only son, Li Shi.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.710
I refuse!

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.110
Okay.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.300
It was my assistant who called.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.820
You see?

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.060
It's so annoying to get a call
when I'm resting.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.740
Mr. Li, I'm sorry.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.620
Mr. Pei has made it clear.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:44.990
After Chen Lei left,

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.860
it's true that our business
has been affected,

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.180
but we'll overcome this.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.860
Mr. Pei trusts me.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.110
I'm going to stay here

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.420
and figure something out.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.300
Anyway, buying us out
is out of the question.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.300
Not in this lifetime.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:01.860
Mr. Ma.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.860
Don't get so stressed out.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.990
It's a commercial deal,

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.300
so we aim for mutual agreement.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.420
However, there's something

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.990
that worries me.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.820
If you insist on holding on like this,

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.860
you'd be literally burning money.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.110
Things could turn into a disaster.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.860
That would be horrible.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.500
I don't think so.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.300
How about this, Mr. Ma?

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.860
Talk to Mr. Pei again.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.820
After all, with the terms
I'm offering now,

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.820
you could say I'm running a charity.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.620
You can rest assured about something.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.670
Mr. Ma, and you...

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:43.739
Mr. Zhang.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.768
Okay. Mr. Zhang.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.300
Both of you are excellent employees,

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.550
so I'll keep you around
after the buyout.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.820
You'll be having a new boss, that's all.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.550
Just do your job as usual.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.620
Nothing will change.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.860
Mr. Zhang?

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.420
Mr. Ma.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.850
Mr. Li has been talking for so long.

00:05:59.857 --> 00:06:01.300
Get him a Moscow mule.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.860
My treat.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:02.740
Sure thing.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:04.500
No need.

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.990
We're leaving. See you.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.420
He looks like a mule.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.940
Outrageous!

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.110
How could anyone

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.620
refuse me, the great Li Shi?

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:27.620
Exactly.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.620
M&Y has been doing badly.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.420
At this point,

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.260
you showed up with
funds and opportunities,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.940
yet they ignored you.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.380
This is weird.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.380
Well, call their boss.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.820
I'll meet him in person!

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:41.420
Yes, sir.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:47.835
(Segregate your trash)

00:06:47.835 --> 00:06:50.260
(Tonight, we are here)

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.670
(to witness...)

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.670
Mom, try this custard filling.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:55.060
Thanks, Son. Put it there.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.380
Come on.

00:06:58.168 --> 00:06:59.260
Why aren't you eating?

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.457
Sit down. Don't block the TV.

00:07:00.502 --> 00:07:01.180
Eat this.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.620
(I will now reveal)

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.820
(the winner of this year's)

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.380
(Dream Voice.)

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:08.670
(Our winner is...)

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.540
Chen Lei!

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.700
(Dream Voice: Chen Lei)

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.300
I told you he'd win!

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.620
Congratulations, Chen Lei!

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.260
This is awesome!

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.260
Chen Lei, is there anything

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.940
you want to say?

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.180
Thank you.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.230
Actually,

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.380
I started singing in an Internet cafe.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.350
They had

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:32.940
a terrible singer...

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.820
You can skip that part.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.670
I just want to say,

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.940
I was lost, unsure of where to go.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.500
Until I met someone.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:41.670
(He told me)

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.380
(that we need to go out,)

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.300
(get beaten up and bounce back)

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.300
(to know yourself truly.)

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.060
I didn't understand what he meant,

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.260
but now I do.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:53.260
I shall be grateful to him forever,

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:54.670
my big brother.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.620
Look, he's got a big brother.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.940
When will our son ever

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.670
have a good brother like him? Right?

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:02.670
(My big brother)

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.550
(is also my mentor in life.)

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.500
(He is the boss of M&Y Internet Cafe.)

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:09.670
(It was he who sponsored me
to be on this show.)

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:10.940
I heard

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.500
that after I left,
business has been bad in the cafe.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.060
So, I want to say

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.540
that after I win this,

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.100
I will go back to the cafe

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:19.580
(to sing)

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:20.540
(and help him out.)

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:21.860
(My dear brother.)

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.380
(Wait for me!)

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.260
(Let's give another round of applause)

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.060
(to Chen Lei!)

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.500
What a brilliant young man.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.140
What's wrong with you?

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.060
Welcome to Jinchuan.

00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:44.270
All passengers are reminded
to maintain order.

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.740
E-hailing passengers,
please proceed to floor B2.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:48.980
(After I win this,)

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.900
(I will go back to the cafe)

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.620
(to sing and help him out.)

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:53.260
Great!

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.900
(My dear brother, wait for me!)

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:55.740
I will.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.580
How touching! Replay that part.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.340
Ma Yang!

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.900
Mr. Pei, you're back.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.020
Why are you here again?

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.340
Mr. Pei, this is Li Shi
from Lishi Capital.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.980
He wants to buy our cafe.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.740
So, you're Mr. Pei?

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.380
We finally meet.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:18.900
Perfect timing.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:20.860
I'm here to ask you

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.380
what you think about my offer.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.700
I'll answer for him. No way. Get lost.

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:26.980
Why you...

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.020
Very well.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.100
But I'm telling you,

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.568
if there's something I can't get,

00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:32.500
I'll never give up.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:33.900
Just you wait and see.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.580
We'll be waiting.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.340
Mr. Li, I...

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.460
I'm happy to take your offer up!

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:41.460
Come on, ignore him.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:42.900
I've changed my mind!

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.580
Emotional intelligence
is not needed now.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.220
We're not scared of anyone.

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.460
Look how touching Chen Lei's speech is.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.380
He's our savior!

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.380
(...and my mentor in life.)

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.100
(He is the owner of M&Y Internet Cafe.)

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.860
(I will go back to the cafe)

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.900
(to sing and help him out.)

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:03.500
Mr. Ma.

00:10:03.613 --> 00:10:05.191
Chen Lei's coming back soon, right?

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.380
I have a great idea.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.580
Let's perform as a duo.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.900
We'll rock the scene! Want to bet?

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:13.220
No way.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.580
You're a great singer with good looks.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:16.740
You might just

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.340
overshadow Chen Lei.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:19.700
I'll play the guitar for him.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:20.413
That works, too.

00:10:20.413 --> 00:10:20.700
Right?

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:21.620
Of course.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:25.460
Li Shi?

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.340
What are you doing?

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:30.100
You're still here?

00:10:30.191 --> 00:10:30.780
Perfect timing.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.260
You're all here.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.460
Mr. Pei, my apologies,

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.700
but this place is mine now.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:43.780
Your place?

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.140
Your place is in the madhouse,
so buzz off.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.700
This kid's got a sense of humor.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:52.220
Very well.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.580
Open your squinty little eyes.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:55.860
Take a look at this.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.980
I've signed a contract
with the landlord here.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.340
Three times the price.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.220
I even paid for his penalty.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.460
So, right now,

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:05.620
you need to leave.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:06.840
I...

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:10.780
This is...

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.340
Real?

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:16.260
You...

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.490
Get rid of that fish!

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:23.460
You guys...

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:28.380
Are you...

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:30.020
Dancing?

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.220
Are you guys sick?

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:35.780
You idiots!

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:37.580
Use a ladder if you can't reach!

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.500
You'd better not touch that,

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:40.620
or else I'll beat you up!

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:41.580
I'm telling you!

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:42.380
Give me that!

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:48.220
Stop that! Who gave you permission?

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.580
Great!

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:51.260
Don't touch that!

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:52.220
Don't you touch that!

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:53.700
Don't touch me!

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:54.980
Put that down!

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:55.860
Don't touch me!

00:11:56.391 --> 00:11:57.780
We built this cafe from scratch!

00:11:57.968 --> 00:11:59.020
Who do you think you are?

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:00.660
Put it down!

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:01.260
Who let you...

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:02.620
Mr. Pei!

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.020
Mr. Pei, say something!

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:11.980
Don't touch that!

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:17.220
Don't touch me!

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:18.500
Don't touch me!

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:24.740
Mr. Li.

00:12:24.902 --> 00:12:26.500
They worked hard to build this cafe.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.260
I'm the boss of this cafe,

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:30.140
so direct your anger at me.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:42.340
How about this?

00:12:42.368 --> 00:12:44.613
How much did you pay?
I'll give you five times more.

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:46.780
10 times.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.700
Even 100 times...

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:52.580
And the answer is still no.

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.740
This place is mine now.

00:12:54.924 --> 00:12:55.780
Don't you go there!

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.460
Hurry up and take that down!

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.500
How dare you?

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:02.100
What the heck?

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:02.700
I...

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:05.900
Li Shi.

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.340
I'm going to record you.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.700
Every single face here.

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:11.980
Your crimes

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:13.460
will be recorded!

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.346
Put your phone down!

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.980
Do you know who my boss is?

00:13:18.502 --> 00:13:20.580
He is the only son of
the prestigious Li family,

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:21.580
Li Shi.

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.460
Founder of Lishi Capital,

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.380
future heir to Fuhui Group.

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:27.500
How dare you record him?

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.980
So what if he's from Fuhui?

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:30.700
Does that give him

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:31.820
the right to bully us?

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:34.860
He hit me!

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.700
He hit me!

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.620
Want to die?

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:46.380
Mr. Li.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:47.860
Must you escalate the situation?

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:48.340
We're just

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.540
trying to earn a living.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.035
Let's take a step back, you and me.

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:55.220
Let me remind you,

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.020
I don't rely on this cafe
to earn a living.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:57.780
Pei Qian.

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.260
You're too weak to take me on.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.700
I'm telling you, you're out.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:05.220
This is my place!

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.700
This isn't your place.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:14.180
Who's there?

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:14.860
This isn't

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:16.100
your playground!

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.020
A random nobody

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.780
has no right to decide anything!

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.780
But I do.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.260
Uncle Lin, Aunt Shen?

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.340
What brings you here?

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:27.100
Don't tell me

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:27.980
they are

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:29.460
the founders of Shenhua Group,

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.580
Lin Zhengnan and Shen Hua?

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:33.700
What? Lin Zhengnan?

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.220
Long time no see, Li Shi.

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:38.780
Uncle Lin, it's been so long.

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:40.460
You must be Mr. Pei.

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.700
Hello, I'm Lin Zhengnan,

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.380
director of Shenhua Group.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.580
We're also Wan's parents.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.140
She often talks about you.

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:50.280
This year, we're celebrating

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.213
Chinese New Year in Jinchuan,
so we dropped by

00:14:52.235 --> 00:14:53.100
to visit you.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:54.900
You may not know that this place

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.980
belongs to Shenhua Group.

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:00.380
Li Shi, as long as I'm around,

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:01.980
you'd better not touch a thing.

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:02.900
What?

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:04.340
We've been

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:05.420
observing you.

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:06.700
Mr. Pei,

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.460
you're so defensive of your employees.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:09.500
Lin,

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.820
he resembles you

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.220
when you were young.

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:14.380
We're going to bring justice

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.140
to Mr. Pei.

00:15:17.124 --> 00:15:18.060
Since we have signed

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:19.020
a contract with you,

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:20.580
as long as you want it,

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.460
this place will be yours.

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:23.460
Mr. Pei, don't worry.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:24.380
We will investigate

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.220
this incident thoroughly.

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.020
Shenhua Group won't allow incidents

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:29.860
of unlawful tenant eviction
to happen again.

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:33.220
This place

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:34.380
is yours to use

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:36.340
indefinitely, for free.

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:37.880
What?

00:15:37.924 --> 00:15:38.813
Oh, gosh!

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.900
Take it as

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:42.700
compensation.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:46.700
Let's go.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.220
Uncle Lin!

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:57.980
I didn't expect

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:00.260
that Lin Wan is your daughter.

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.780
Thank you for coming to my help,

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:03.620
but I think

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:05.140
I should pay the rent...

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:05.780
Mr. Pei.

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.020
My daughter Wan

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:09.460
has always been a stubborn girl.

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.100
Ever since she returned from overseas,

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.580
she has insisted on making games.

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:13.780
She's not interested

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.340
in the family business.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.100
She's got her own mind,

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.780
and we can't stop her.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.580
However,

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.700
ever since she came to Jinchuan,

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.020
she's happy to talk to us

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.380
about work.

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:29.220
She also looks more cheerful now.

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:30.180
Mr. Pei.

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:31.700
Thank you.

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:33.620
Not at all.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:34.580
Here's the thing.

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:35.580
I'm deducing

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:37.580
that you don't want Lin Wan

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.020
to work in the gaming industry.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:39.702
How about this?

00:16:39.702 --> 00:16:40.580
I'll talk to her,

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.460
and I'll pay the rent as usual...

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.020
Wan is an obstinate girl.

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:45.460
She wants to forge her own path,

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.340
and she refuses to use our money

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.580
to set up her own company.

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:50.780
She suffered a lot
when she worked at Sky Fire

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:51.780
at the lowest level,

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:53.340
but she survived.

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.780
Now that she
insists on working in Tengda,

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:58.100
we can only support her.

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.260
Mr. Pei, you may not know this.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.460
She doesn't listen to anything we say.

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:04.220
But she trusts you.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.900
Both of you are young.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.413
When you start a business together,

00:17:08.457 --> 00:17:10.580
you grow up together too, right?

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:12.980
Don't worry.

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.180
I will train her

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.460
to the best of my ability.

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:19.060
Great, we shall not
disturb you any longer.

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:20.060
Take care.

00:17:20.191 --> 00:17:21.300
I'll walk you to the door.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:22.060
By the way,

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.940
don't let Wan know we came.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.180
Yes.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.540
I understand.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:31.700
Mr. and Mrs. Lin,

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.420
why don't I pay the rent

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.700
as usual?

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.060
Good news, everyone.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.300
Mr. Lin is paying

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.980
for everyone tonight!

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.460
- Great!
- Wow!

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:47.540
The Lins...

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:50.420
You're my worst enemy.

00:18:01.924 --> 00:18:03.060
(Ms. Mei)
(Hello, Mr. Pei.)

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.413
(Your purchase contract is ready.)

00:18:04.435 --> 00:18:05.740
(Can you come over to take a look?)

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:07.280
(Mr. Pei, are you busy again today?)

00:18:07.324 --> 00:18:08.580
(Dude, are you coming?)

00:18:09.191 --> 00:18:11.340
(Dude, I know buying a house
is a serious decision,)

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.260
(but don't tell me you're canceling...)

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.260
M&Y's profits are consistently rising.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.420
(M&Y, little profit)

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.460
Crowded every night.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.500
Li Shi tried to step in.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.020
I thought I could finally
get rid of this burning problem,

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.980
and I failed because

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.460
Lin Zhengnan unleashed his money attack.

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.740
If this goes on...

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.220
My salary would always be 5,000 yuan.

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.220
I'm doomed.

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:51.700
What a calamity.

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:54.260
I can't keep you around anymore.

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:10.220
Lin Wan, how's work

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:11.420
since you joined us?

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.220
Anything challenging?

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:15.700
No.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.020
It's much easier
than my time in Sky Fire.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.220
Now that Lv is the project manager,

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:21.220
I've been meaning to ask

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.220
if you have other tasks for me.

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.020
I have an assignment for you.

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:27.220
I want you to list down

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:28.460
every game in the past 10 years

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:29.780
that proved to be unprofitable

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.300
with bad reviews.

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:32.820
I want a complete and detailed report.

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:34.220
Don't even miss out a single detail.

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:35.740
Submit the report once you're done.

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:37.180
I don't like reading electronic files,

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.820
so print it out.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:42.140
Mr. Pei, are you trying to learn

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.740
from those games' failure?

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:46.500
Kind of.

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:50.180
Sure, when do you need it?

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:50.980
This month.

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:52.980
This month?

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:54.980
This month is almost over.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:58.260
But I can complete it
if I work overtime.

00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:59.580
But our company...

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.020
If you need it,

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.140
I can give you

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:03.460
the privilege

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:04.220
of working overtime.

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:05.340
You'll be the only one here

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:06.300
who can work overtime

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:07.260
whenever you want,

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.140
and you can decide
how long you want to work.

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:11.740
Just me?

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:15.220
Just you.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:17.980
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:19.460
I shall work hard to complete my task.

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:20.260
I won't let you down.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:21.580
I'm going to work overtime now.

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:26.700
So young, so naive.

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.980
Once you work overtime,
you'll feel the pain.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.500
Go home and inherit
your family's business.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:39.980
Mr. Pei, are you holding a staff dinner

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:41.220
after the holidays?

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.140
Yeah.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.180
It's meant to relieve anxiety

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.260
that may arise
upon returning to work.

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:48.420
It helps everyone get ready
for another year of work.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:49.940
In such tough times,

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:51.660
what's wrong with treating everyone

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:52.580
to a good meal?

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:55.900
Besides,

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.020
my salary this month

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:58.700
is only 5,000 again.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.260
I can barely eat three meals a day. I...

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:02.220
I've been waiting for this dinner.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.220
According to the contract,

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.420
Chapter 8, No. 269,

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:08.460
staff dinners cannot exceed
150 yuan per person.

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.460
Your budget is too high.

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:11.900
Ms. Xin.

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.340
Everyone had to sit at separate tables

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:15.700
at our last dinner

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:17.460
thanks to your rules.

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:18.220
Besides,

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.220
with so many people in the company,

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:21.220
sitting separately

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.580
is bad for team building.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.460
If we want to find a restaurant

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:27.460
that can accommodate all our employees,

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:29.420
we need to spend
more than 150 yuan per person.

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:33.220
Chapter 8, No. 270.

00:21:33.591 --> 00:21:35.260
What about booking
the entire restaurant?

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:38.180
Chapter 8, No. 271.

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:39.220
No wasting.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:41.980
You won't let me do anything!

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.680
I just want to gather
everyone for dinner!

00:21:43.746 --> 00:21:45.235
It's not like I'm opening a restaurant!

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.980
Mr. Pei!

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.700
Is this the right way?

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.140
Are we lost?

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.260
Hang on, we're almost there.

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:21.340
Qian, what kind of restaurant is it?

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.220
Are you sure this is a good location?

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:24.140
Relax.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.740
I'm using a shortcut.

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:27.900
It's right in front.

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.580
My legs are breaking down.

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:38.340
Let me search my location.

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:44.020
There's no phone signal, Mr. Pei!

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:47.820
He's right.

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:48.700
No signal!

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:50.220
Are we still in Jinchuan?

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:51.740
Qian.

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:54.260
This doesn't look right.

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:55.700
Is this a dinner

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:57.260
or a survival challenge?

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:58.420
I know.

00:22:58.700 --> 00:22:59.980
This place

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.660
is far from the city,

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:03.460
but it's close to nature.

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.980
There are mountains, rivers and scenery.

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:08.980
But no people!

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:10.540
(National Highway 237,
Mingyun Villa)

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:29.500
Here we are.

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:31.140
Where are we?

00:23:31.191 --> 00:23:32.980
We're setting up
a private restaurant here?

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.260
This is nuts.

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:37.580
Mingyun Villa?

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:38.900
Mr. Pei.

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:41.980
Is this restaurant project
important to you?

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.660
When I worked at the Internet cafe,

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.140
I was just a humble cook.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:46.700
I don't think I can manage

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.580
a restaurant for real.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:50.340
Lin.

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:53.420
When managing a restaurant,
business comes second.

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:56.740
What's crucial is managing ingredients.

00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:58.700
You have the capabilities.

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:01.140
Besides, you're one of our own.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.340
I can't trust

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:03.900
outsiders anymore.

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.140
Look at you, so dependable.

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:08.220
Your fries

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:09.940
never come with ketchup,

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:11.460
unlike some villains

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:12.700
who'd stab you at the back.

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:13.700
Who stabbed whom?

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:15.420
Tell me, Qian.

00:24:15.502 --> 00:24:16.191
Who stabbed you?

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:17.220
Lin.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.980
Only you can be the restaurant manager.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:20.780
If we lose money,

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:22.260
I'll take responsibility.

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.020
I...

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:25.540
Mr. Ma.

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:26.900
Look.

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:27.740
Let's go.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:30.980
This place is too deserted.

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:38.340
Mr. Pei.

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:41.220
Since you trust me so much,

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:41.980
I'll do it.

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:43.460
But I need to ask

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:44.700
some questions.

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.820
We are currently

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.260
at the southeastern side of Jinchuan.

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:50.220
Driving from the west

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:52.220
or north side of the city

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.220
would take over two hours.

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:55.700
Everyone would be too tired to eat.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:56.260
Yeah.

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:58.460
Driving two hours for lunch,

00:24:58.460 --> 00:24:59.660
then another two hours back,

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:00.700
stuck in rush hour traffic,

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:01.724
just in time for dinner?

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.940
The thing is, there's nothing else here.

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:05.940
When we do something,

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:08.220
we can't just look at the present.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.420
Mingyun Villa will be

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:12.420
Jinchuan's next commercial center.

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.460
I'm pre-strategizing

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:16.380
to create

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:18.220
a solid foundation for Tengda's

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.740
high-end markets.

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.300
Okay.

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:24.460
Believe in me.

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:26.420
I will succeed this time.

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:30.060
(Mingyun Villa)

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:32.340
Come on. Let's take a look inside.

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:05.660
Mr. Pei!

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.980
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:08.500
It wasn't easy to get here.

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:09.700
Sorry for making you wait.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:10.420
Cui.

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:12.700
This is an awesome place.

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:19.220
Mr. Pei, you like this place?

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:20.260
Of course.

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.420
I'm telling you,

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.220
across this road is outside Jinchuan,

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:25.368
and it's not my territory,

00:26:25.391 --> 00:26:26.900
so I won't be able to serve you then.

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:27.980
Cui.

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:28.980
Did you ask them

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:30.140
if this place is up for rent?

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:30.700
Yes.

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:31.980
I'm telling you,

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.660
this is a complex case.

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:35.180
It took me a lot of effort

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:36.340
to locate the developer.

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:37.900
They told me

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:38.500
that this unit

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:39.500
is still first-hand.

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:40.740
It's never been sold.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:43.500
So they're selling it, not renting.

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:46.220
I see.

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:48.900
What a pity.

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:49.700
Yeah.

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:50.780
Exactly.

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:52.220
I'm telling you,

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:53.820
you could say this journey

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:55.020
is a work trip in itself.

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:57.140
So, let's go.

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.900
Looks like I'll have to buy this place.

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:26.580
(Mingyun Villa)

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:35.100
Slowly.

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:36.260
Excuse me.

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:37.740
We need two people up here!

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:38.700
Okay!

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:41.060
Mr. Ma, I need help!

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:42.500
Don't tough it out!

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.740
Where do I put this?

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:46.020
Let me think!

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:46.780
Mr. Pei.

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.060
(Hope of the Village)

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.740
It's so hard to see you in person.

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:52.540
Why are you setting up a restaurant

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:53.940
at such a place?

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:55.500
I...

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:56.500
No!

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:57.980
No!

00:27:58.260 --> 00:27:58.780
I...

00:27:58.900 --> 00:27:59.660
No...

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:00.700
Where do I put this?

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:01.740
Right here.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:03.020
Here.

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:05.380
Lin Wan.

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:07.020
What brings you here?

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:07.660
You asked me

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.460
to compile a list of failed games.

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:10.340
It's complete.

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:12.700
I've sent a copy to your email.

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:16.500
You've compiled everything?

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:17.980
From the past 10 years?

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:18.940
Yes.

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:20.500
Then,

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:23.980
what about another 10 years before?

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.260
Another 10 years before?

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:26.020
Yes.

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:27.700
You youngsters

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:30.740
need to learn
how to be humble and patient.

00:28:31.546 --> 00:28:32.657
Sure, Mr. Pei. No problem.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.980
Don't make me stop you
from getting work done.

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:37.020
Once you're done reading,
I'll talk to you again.

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:38.060
I'm off.

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:52.500
Mr. Pei, Mr. Ma, goodbye.

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:54.500
This girl's got gusto.

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:58.100
(Loss: Private Restaurant)

00:28:58.100 --> 00:28:59.900
(Profits: Games. Internet Cafe.)

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:04.540
(Total Assets)

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:07.220
(Shenhua International)

00:29:08.591 --> 00:29:09.340
Bao, you're back.

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:10.180
Over here!

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:11.500
Bao is back!

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:12.420
Mr. Pei, Bao is back.

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:13.420
Bao Xu is back.

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:14.260
Bao.

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:17.260
Bao.

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:18.660
Look, Yintang.

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:19.980
What happened to Bao?

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:20.946
You don't recognize him?

00:29:20.968 --> 00:29:21.780
That's Bao.

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:22.420
Yeah.

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:23.260
What happened?

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:23.940
Bao.

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.780
Your eyes...

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:38.260
Mr. Pei.

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:40.300
Not bad.

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:42.220
Your journey

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:43.740
has bulked you up.

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:48.740
How could I not bulk up?

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:50.740
I wake up early
and sleep late every day.

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:51.902
Video calls and location tags!

00:29:51.924 --> 00:29:53.940
Wherever I go,
I need to report immediately!

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:55.260
My yearly trip quota

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.460
has been stretched to the max!

00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:57.460
I'm telling you,

00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:58.940
I'm going to stay at home all day now.

00:29:58.940 --> 00:29:59.940
Don't send me

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:01.980
on these dumb trips anymore!

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:06.460
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:08.700
Not bad. Keep it up.

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:10.500
I told you,

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.980
you should join more tours like this.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:15.100
Bao.

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:16.500
Take a break.

00:30:16.591 --> 00:30:18.180
Come back to work when you're rested.

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:25.740
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:34.220
(Mingyun Villa)

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:41.220
That mountain path

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:42.580
reminds me

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:44.980
of my military training.

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:47.780
Why go through so much hassle
just for a meal?

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:48.700
Lin Wan.

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:50.740
Is the chef here?

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:51.980
Yes.

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:54.740
What kind of idiot

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.020
would dine at
a deserted place like this?

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:58.980
Mr. Pei spent a lot
renovating this place.

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:00.980
Let's take a look around.

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:01.740
Come on.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:02.540
Let's go.

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:03.260
Go.

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:07.260
This place...

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:08.260
It's not

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:10.500
what I'd expect
from a private restaurant.

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:17.740
The interior

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:19.500
seems better furnished than outside.

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:21.460
Yes,

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:24.340
but the style is...

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:25.900
I can't pinpoint it.

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:34.500
Where's Bao and Lv?

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:35.940
Didn't they come here early today?

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:36.940
Where are they?

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:38.500
They sent a message,

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:39.980
saying they're in the fields.

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:42.124
They're asking us to join them
to prepare ingredients.

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:43.500
- The fields?
- What?

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:53.260
(Carrots)
We've been toiling all morning.

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:56.180
You're finally here.

00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:58.500
It really is Bao.

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.500
We need to harvest these veggies?

00:32:00.902 --> 00:32:03.700
If it weren't for the work hours
being used for this group meal,

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.220
I wouldn't have come.

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:07.180
This is what we're eating?

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:08.740
It seems so.

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:10.902
This place is so remote,
and veggies are so expensive.

00:32:10.902 --> 00:32:12.700
I'm starving to death!

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:14.500
I think it's okay.

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:15.740
It looks fun.

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:17.220
Fun?

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:23.740
This is so much fun!

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.980
Come on. Let's do this together!

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:27.980
Come on!

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:29.500
Bao, help me.

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:30.420
I'll help you.

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:31.500
Which veggie?

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:32.220
The bok choy.

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:32.740
Okay.

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:35.220
My back is breaking.

00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:43.500
Here's the fish.

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:48.220
Mr. Pei, all dishes have been served.

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:50.260
Chef Lin, you've worked hard.

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:52.020
Tell everyone to sit down and dig in.

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:53.740
Okay, thank you.

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:55.020
Everything's ready.

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:56.980
Come on, sit down and have lunch.

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:57.780
Sit down.

00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:58.740
So,

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:00.780
since lunch is ready,

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:02.980
let me salute everyone

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:04.020
with a cup of tea.

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:04.740
Today,

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:07.220
we have three joyful events to share.

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:07.980
First,

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:10.140
Sibo is about to embark

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:11.540
on his own business journey.

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:12.300
Let's wish him

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:14.580
success and prosperity.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:16.020
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:16.500
Nice!

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:17.500
Thank you, everyone!

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:18.220
Second,

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:20.660
Bao Xu has returned to the team.

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:22.168
He has left an unhealthy lifestyle

00:33:22.191 --> 00:33:23.460
to begin a new life.

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:26.540
Third.

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:27.980
It's about

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:30.380
our unnamed private restaurant.

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:33.020
We're opening soon.

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:35.820
So, dine and drink
to your heart's content.

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.100
If you don't eat well,

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:39.020
you can't think well.

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:40.460
Cheers!

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:41.780
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:47.740
Dig in.

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:50.740
This fish

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:52.220
was hand-caught today

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:53.940
by Lv himself.

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:54.740
Try it.

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:00.180
Not bad.

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:02.700
Mr. Pei.

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:04.660
Here's the thing.

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:06.420
About this private restaurant,

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:08.302
shouldn't we reconsider
our business model?

00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:09.660
Just today,

00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:10.860
everyone has been working

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:12.140
in the fields or on the river.

00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:12.940
We're too pooped

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:14.660
to eat, and we just want to sleep.

00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:15.460
Ma Yang.

00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:19.380
You need to know

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.060
that this restaurant

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.380
caters to the rich.

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:24.180
That's why

00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:26.340
we need to think from their perspective.

00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:28.380
Do they lack good food?

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:29.860
What do they lack?

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:31.460
Morals?

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:37.500
According to historical records,

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:39.620
rich people

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:41.420
enjoy suffering when they don't have to,

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:42.660
and experiencing life.

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:44.300
I've heard of that.

00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:46.020
So,

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.260
we need to think from their perspective

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:50.740
about what they want.

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.340
Do they need

00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:55.060
good food?

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:56.020
No.

00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:56.980
What they want

00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:59.700
is the story and spirit
behind good food.

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:01.100
They lack spirit.

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:02.740
What are we selling here?

00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:03.980
We're selling

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:06.420
craftmanship.

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:11.300
Mr. Pei.

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:12.740
Shouldn't we name

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:13.580
our restaurant?

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:14.580
No one can search

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:15.524
our restaurant online.

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:18.020
No.

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:19.740
I believe

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.740
that in the endless stream of history,

00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:23.980
a name is but

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.260
a significant speck of dust.

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:28.140
Promotions,

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:29.460
advertising, and names

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:30.780
are nothing.

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:32.060
Ma Yang, I understand

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:32.740
that you

00:35:32.946 --> 00:35:34.700
haven't reached
my level of enlightenment,

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:35.820
so you can't understand yet.

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:36.300
So,

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.060
let me

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:38.540
give you a piece of fish.

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:40.500
Once you're as enlightened as I am,

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:42.300
you will understand my thoughts.

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:43.700
Pardon me while I talk to Sibo.

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:45.460
Sibo,

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:46.940
how's your business planning

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:48.180
getting along?

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:49.020
Mr. Pei.

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:49.700
Lately,

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.500
after much thought

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:53.020
and market research,

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:54.700
I have gotten a little inspiration

00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:57.060
for my business project.

00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:58.500
What do you want to do?

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:00.300
Web novels.

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:04.220
Web novels?

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:07.380
(A bunch of words,)

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:09.020
(which means no practical value.)

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:11.220
(Contract writer = Paying for nothing)

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:13.168
(Web novel = Contract Writer
and a bunch of words.)

00:36:13.168 --> 00:36:14.539
(Which means a guaranteed loss.)

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:15.780
I'll invest 1 million yuan in you.

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:16.924
I can add more if it's not enough.

00:36:16.946 --> 00:36:17.580
That's enough!

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:18.540
Enough!

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:19.340
Enough!

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:21.260
Mr. Pei, here's the thing.

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:23.220
You see, I've been making games,

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:26.460
but I love reading web novels.

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:28.660
I'm a literature enthusiast.

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:30.740
Now that you're giving me
a chance to start a business,

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:33.220
I want to make use of my talents

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:34.620
to launch Tengda's

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:36.780
first-ever web novel venture

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:39.100
so that we can create more value.

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:39.820
Then...

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:42.740
Don't worry

00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:43.580
about creating value.

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:44.260
Here.

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:46.260
Have some fish.

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:50.380
Where's Lin Wan?

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:51.740
Why isn't she here?

00:36:51.857 --> 00:36:53.580
That kid has fallen
in love with farming.

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:54.724
She's working in the fields.

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:01.060
Lin Wan.

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:02.060
You're not eating?

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:03.980
You've taken a liking to harvesting?

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:06.900
I think this is meaningful work.

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:08.900
I've never had such an experience.

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:12.860
By the way, Lin Wan,

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:14.780
I've read your reports.

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:16.220
Thank you.

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:17.740
No way.

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:19.380
You've finished reading everything?

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:22.100
I didn't want

00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:24.020
to waste your efforts.

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:26.380
Actually, I'm here

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:28.260
to talk to you

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:30.820
about my thoughts on life.

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:34.400
You've compiled so much information
in a short period of time.

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.130
You've been secretly
working overtime, right?

00:37:36.146 --> 00:37:37.820
The company made
such an unreasonable request

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:39.180
for something so unproductive.

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:40.180
If you stay here,

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:41.740
you'd have to work day and night,

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:42.980
until your break time

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:44.100
is spent in the office too.

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:45.540
What's the meaning of this?

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:48.140
Why don't you

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:50.300
go home, okay?

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:53.780
I brought this for myself,
but I haven't drunk any.

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:57.020
Did you understand

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:58.380
what I just said?

00:37:58.580 --> 00:37:59.780
I get it.

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:00.860
Mr. Pei, you think

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:03.220
that both Tengda and its employees

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:05.340
should step out of our comfort zone.

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:06.700
We need to think and act boldly

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:08.700
instead of limiting ourselves.

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:10.140
I will try my best to achieve

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:11.580
work-life balance.

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:19.940
Forget it.

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:22.900
Remember to claim your OT pay.

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:27.100
By the way,

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:29.820
I asked you to compile

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:32.700
more failed games
from another 10 years back.

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:34.500
Don't tell me you've completed it.

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:38.220
Mr. Pei, I've compiled everything.

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:41.060
I see.

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:43.180
Another 10 years back, then.

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:44.860
Okay.

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:48.220
Look.

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:49.660
Look at this.

00:38:49.702 --> 00:38:51.780
First, the Internet cafe,
now a private restaurant.

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:53.220
There's no end to their antics.

00:38:58.100 --> 00:38:59.140
Outrageous.

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:00.540
They're obviously provoking me.

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:02.100
Yeah.

00:39:02.102 --> 00:39:04.435
You told me that the Internet cafe
was just a coincidence,

00:39:04.502 --> 00:39:05.180
and I agreed.

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:06.620
But a private restaurant?

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:09.620
That's Lishi Capital's specialty.

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:11.900
Muyan.

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:14.860
Look around you.

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:17.260
This is what you call
a private restaurant.

00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:19.100
That thing they built?

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:20.180
It's pathetic.

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:20.860
I'm telling you.

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:22.180
Not anyone can get a share

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:25.020
of the private restaurant market.

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:28.700
Back when that long-faced guy
rejected me,

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:30.300
I'm sure it was Pei Qian

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:31.620
who made him do so.

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:32.660
Now, they should know

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:33.860
what I plan to do.

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:34.900
That long-faced guy

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:35.740
is dead loyal

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:37.860
to Pei Qian.

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:41.580
Mr. Li Jr.

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:44.180
I feel the same way.

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:46.500
I'm also dead loyal to you...

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:49.540
Between us,
we don't need to talk about that.

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:51.380
You see.

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:53.340
They opened an Internet cafe,

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:55.460
and now a private restaurant.

00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:57.180
What in the world

00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:58.700
are they planning?

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.180
Don't worry.

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:02.580
Tengda is not indomitable.

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:05.860
That long-faced guy
may be loyal to Pei Qian,

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:08.020
but what about the other employees?

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.460
We don't know about that.

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.820
Mr. Li Jr., are you sure
you don't want me to follow you?

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:49.980
No need.

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:51.460
I shall walk

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:53.900
this path by myself.
