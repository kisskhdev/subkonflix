=Do You Wish to Be My Brother's Bride?=

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.200
I should find a place
to settle in first.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:52.630
Wait.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.110
Have we

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.640
met before?

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.480
Why do you feel so familiar to me?

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.880
Ying Du,

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.400
we...

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.200
(We were once deeply in love.)

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.680
You know my name.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:18.790
(Indeed.)

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.510
(At this time, he hadn't met me.)

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.120
Yes.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.150
I know more than just your name.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.480
I know you are cool outside
but warm inside,

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.430
a fool who'd give his life for love.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.950
A fool?

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.680
Come in.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.880
Snow's falling hard.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.230
Do you plan on standing
in the wild all day?

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:09.020
(Wuyue tribe)

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.030
Miss,

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.360
why are you crying nonstop?

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.870
Did my brother just make you cry?

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.800
I just...

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.680
I just miss home.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.680
Every time I cry,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.910
my brother picks plum blossoms

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.080
and makes sweet congee to cheer me up.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.130
Du,

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.470
can you make some

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.560
for her

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.590
to cheer her up?

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.280
Little one,

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.000
he's your brother?

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.080
Then where are your parents?

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.400
Why

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.150
haven't I seen them around?

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.630
I've never met them.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.310
I only have my brother.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.870
Do you want to be my brother's bride?

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.360
I...

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.740
Well, I...

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.800
Little one,

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:21.910
what's your name?

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.990
Fengwu.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.240
My brother gave me that name.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.120
Feng as in whispering winds,

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.400
and Wu as in secret dealings.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:36.710
What a coincidence.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.280
Grandmother used to call me Fengwu too.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.680
You shouldn't have come.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.590
Your Majesty.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.150
You can't change anything.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.520
Why wager everything on one move?

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:16.680
But, Your Majesty,

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.480
Puluo State needs you.

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:19.750
(He is...)

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.750
(Luo Cheng of this lifetime.)

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.630
I spent three years

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.950
helping Puluo State end the turmoil,

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.070
turning a small frontier tribe

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.870
into what is now the Puluo State.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.040
Puluo no longer needs me.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.600
According to our pact, my duty now is

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.560
to protect Fengwu.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.960
Your Majesty,

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.830
four years ago,

00:04:41.841 --> 00:04:43.760
what kind of pact did you make
with the Goddess?

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.240
May I know the truth?

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.390
I promise

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.630
never again to disturb your life
with Fengwu.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.390
Four years earlier,

00:04:57.866 --> 00:04:59.160
Puluo suffered a crushing defeat.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.310
Thousands of comrades

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.680
were trapped deep within enemy lines,

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.040
with their fate unknown.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.480
To rescue them,

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.510
I sought the help of the Goddess.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.120
I foresaw that my daughter

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.310
would face a fatal calamity.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.390
If you are willing
to make a pact with me,

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.240
protect her forever,

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.480
and help her overcome all misfortune

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.630
after my death,

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.600
(Goddess Xingyue)

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.630
I shall grant you

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.000
my supreme power

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.390
to aid you through Puluo's crisis.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.870
Do you accept that?

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.310
If it can bring thousands of soldiers
back to life,

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.070
I'll do whatever it takes.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.920
I beg of you.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.240
For Puluo State,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.560
I have fulfilled my mission.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.070
But for Fengwu,

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.390
I must protect her

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.000
and honor my promise.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:25.710
Your Majesty,

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.160
I understand.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.190
(Ying Du made a pact with the Goddess.)

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.720
(But why did he later become the ruler)

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.600
(and even cross paths with me?)

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:46.920
You've heard the whole story.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.190
Still planning to hide?

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.830
Are you talking about me?

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:53.360
Who else could it be?

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.320
I...

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.160
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.190
I just...

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:09.360
Just what?

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.430
I only wanted to know

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.600
what pact you made with the Goddess.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.000
Who exactly are you?

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:22.270
Where did you come from?

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.680
Why do you know me so well?

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.350
I...

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:30.760
Du.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.830
Careful now.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.120
How did you get out?

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.070
Du, let her go.

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.000
She hasn't agreed

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.270
- to be your bride.
- Fengwu...

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:41.920
Bride? Fengwu is making that up.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:42.880
We...

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.680
You can turn back time too?

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.120
Who exactly are you?

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.870
What's your name?

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:55.710
Zhaoli.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:56.870
My name is Zhaoli.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.390
Ying Du, don't forget me.

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.620
(Year 11 of Rongxi)

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.750
Why am I

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.750
still here?

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.120
What are you doing here?

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.720
You look so familiar.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.070
Have we met

00:08:19.243 --> 00:08:20.723
(9-year-old Fengwu)
somewhere before?

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:22.270
Zhaoli,

00:08:22.729 --> 00:08:24.516
have you finished picking
the plum blossoms?

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.160
It's you.

00:08:35.766 --> 00:08:37.143
I've waited for you for four years.

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:40.320
At last, you've come.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.150
You've been waiting for me?

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.610
Zhaoli,

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:54.470
come here.

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.000
Ying Du, what did you just call her?

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.320
Zhaoli.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.390
Four years ago, you suddenly vanished.

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:05.505
Since then,

00:09:05.516 --> 00:09:06.510
in my brother's dreams,

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.120
he'd been calling your name,

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.030
lost and restless all day long.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.630
So, I took the name Zhaoli.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.200
That way, when he calls for Zhaoli,

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.630
he won't be reminded of you.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:16.840
Since you refuse
to be my brother's bride,

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:19.240
please, stay away from him.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.960
(Fengwu is Zhaoli,)

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.440
(which means me.)

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:26.150
Zhaoli, stop talking.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.750
(Why don't I remember anything?)

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.150
(Could they be Ying Du and me)

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:32.330
(from another time and space?)

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:33.680
Zhaoli,

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.200
no matter what, you must trust Ying Du.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.390
Do not harm him.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:38.960
Promise me.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.000
What are you talking about?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:40.840
Do you remember?
