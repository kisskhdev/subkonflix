Have you ever wondered

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.740
how different our lives would be

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.680
if goodness could be
redeemed for wishes?

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.720
Please scan your face.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.960
Blink.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.400
One more time.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.000
Turn your head to the left.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.760
Turn your head to the right.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.960
Open your mouth.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.640
Move your head in a circle.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.840
Smile.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.680
Verification successful.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.840
This is as messy as
a bank verification process!

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.520
3,600 points?

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.480
How did I get these?

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.760
For not talking back
when A-Mah disciplined me.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.280
For not crossing the road
during red lights.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.120
For helping stray cats.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.240
That would explain it.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.600
Please specify your wishes.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.280
It's gotta be money,

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.240
work,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.880
or a lover!

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.840
I wish I had the funds
to start my shio pan business.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.920
I wish for an inexpensive rental!

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.280
I wish for a hot,

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.160
posh, rich lover!

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.080
Your wishes exceed your merit points.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.280
Huh?!

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.800
Everything feels off-limits!

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.280
What the heck? Is it really too much
to ask to have someone by my side?

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.560
Stupid app.

What the heck? Is it really too much
to ask to have someone by my side?

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.240
Is this the 3,600-point wish I redeemed?

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.080
086...

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.420
Okay.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.840
Hello?

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.360
Could you tell me the rent
for the shophouse on Soi 7?

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.080
Huh?!

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.720
40,000!

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.120
With a three-month deposit?!

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.160
Well, do you offer any discounts?

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.080
Alright, thank you.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.000
My dream is way pricier
than I imagined...

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.080
Izzy, Natty, Bushy, me!

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.520
- Doesn't feel like we ate.
- Mmm.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.920
- Let's go.
- Go.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.440
Want some of the good stuff?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.720
Jeez, Auntie Itt!

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.400
Easy with the smacking!

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.440
It's Queen Izzy, you know?

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.200
I've told you so many times
not to call me that.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.200
Well, you're my mom's sister,

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.680
so how could I just call you that?

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.120
Jeez, I'm gonna smack your mouth!

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.760
She's right, though.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.300
Alright, alright, alright.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.800
I'll call you Izzy.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.560
How totally precious!

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.560
You too, Natty.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.880
I've told you so many times
not to serve herbal liquor to my niece.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.320
You're leading the youths astray!

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.800
That's over the top.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.840
"Leading the youths astray," huh?

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.080
Your niece is already 24,

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.080
right?

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:43.800
Facts.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.560
You've had it since you were 20.
Don't be a party pooper.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.280
Oh, burn!

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:50.880
So what happened today?

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.360
You've got such a long face.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.200
I was looking for a shophouse today,

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.480
and the cheap ones looked
straight out of a horror movie.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.240
Those in prime locations with good exposure

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.360
would cost me an arm and a leg!

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.120
Well, why do you have to be so ambitious?

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:10.800
He's right.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.560
You only perfected that special shio pan recipe
two months ago, no?

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.480
Hey.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.240
How about you test the waters
by selling online?

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.480
I bet that'll work.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.520
There's no way.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.320
My shio pan recipe is really special!

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.880
What if someone steals my thunder?

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.600
Besides,

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.170
shio pans are way too cute
to stay hidden in the kitchen.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:33.720
That's why a physical store is a must.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:34.990
Ugh.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.760
You have the attitude
of a Le Condon Blur graduate, sweetie.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.320
Jeez!

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.360
- It's 'Le Cordon Bleu,' sis!
- 'Le Cordon Bleu!'

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.960
Okay, "Le Cordon Bleu."

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.120
- Yeah.
- Yes, like that.

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:44.400
Okay, "Le Cordon Bleu."

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.080
Look.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.280
Why don't you move back in with A-Mah?

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.560
I think you'll be financially comfortable
and all that.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.680
She might even invest in your business.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.680
I don't think that's gonna happen, Bushy.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:57.640
Why not?

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.960
To that family,

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.360
I'm basically a second-class citizen.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.160
Ready?

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.600
Just a sec! Just a sec...

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.760
I'm sorry.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.720
Excuse me, can the girl
in the back scoot over, please?

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.200
- Me?
- That's right.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:21.880
Please scoot over.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.360
I'm trying, so just give me a sec.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.320
Just get it over with.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.000
I'm getting cramps now!

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.559
Three, two, one.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.559
Ever since Dad passed away,

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.280
I've become a parasite in that family.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.440
Plus, my older relatives told me

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.040
that A-Mah sees me as a jinx

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.800
who caused her beloved son's death.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.000
Girl, you're overthinking it.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.400
Facts.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.600
Mm.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:00.800
Right.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.970
Izzy said your old company

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.120
invited you back as a full-time employee,
didn't they?

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.920
Ugh! You can cross that option off, too.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.560
What now?

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.240
Just ask her.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.560
Please have a seat.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.560
I called you in because I wanted
to have a word with you.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.560
Your performance was excellent.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.000
Are you open to joining us
as a full-time employee?

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.200
Only a few months left
before your graduation, right?

[Jenika Leewatcharaanant (Jane)]

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.960
I can definitely wait.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.610
Honestly...

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:35.960
I don't see myself in the Comm Arts field.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.720
What?

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.320
So why pursue this field?

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.800
When I was in high school,
I didn't know which major to choose.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.160
I saw that lots of my friends
chose this field,

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.440
so I followed in their footsteps.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.640
But once I started working in this field,
I never really came to like it.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.520
Besides, I've seen my mom working
a 9-to-5 her whole life,

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.920
and I don't want that life.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.080
I want to be my own boss.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.600
Your own boss?

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.720
What's your plan?

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.160
I've never thought of it.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.380
Okay...

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.160
That's fine.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.150
There's that.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:17.600
Alright.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.680
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.160
Kids these days.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.400
"I want to be my own boss."

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.390
Seeing as how she was
that feisty toward him,

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.400
it'd be a wonder if they'd take her back.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.360
I just don't want to be anyone's employee!

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.120
- How about this?
- Hm?

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:42.800
Let's use our lucky points.

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:45.760
"Lucky points"?

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.920
Jane, how come you don't know about it?

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.560
Are you really a Gen Zer?

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.440
Even big girlies like us know that.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.400
Definitely.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.880
It's the application that lets you
redeem your good deeds for wishes.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.160
Haven't you heard of it?

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.280
- Stop talking nonsense!
- Ow!

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.560
Isn't that application a total scam?

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.600
Girl!

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.760
Scam, my ass.

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:09.160
Bushy and I already got our wishes.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:09.600
True.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.760
Do you remember the day you got sick
and had to go to the hospital,

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.600
when you weren't with us?

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.600
Yeah, I do.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.720
That was when it unfolded...

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.160
Ugh!

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.600
This place is dead silent.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.490
What are we going to do?

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.200
The installment's due in two days.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.240
Right, girl.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:36.440
If this goes on,
we won't be able to pay them.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.500
For sure.

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.000
I'm not even sure

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.610
if they'll send someone to beat us!

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:43.010
- Gosh!
- That's so scary!

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.200
Look.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:46.320
What?

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.240
I downloaded the 'Lucky Points' app,

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.200
but I don't know how to sign up.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.200
What even is that? It looks sus.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:53.560
It might not even be reliable.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.480
Let's just give it a try, in case it works.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:56.600
Fine, then.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.080
- Sign up.
- Here it is.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.320
Oh, I got it!

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.800
- There are 2,800 points!
- Whoa!

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.120
2,800?! Girl, you're insanely blessed!

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.120
Let's not waste any more time.
Make a wish.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:14.040
I wish both of us could pay off
the installments sooner.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.000
Sadhu!

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:17.560
Type it in.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.000
Like this?

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.880
Our bar offers five different drinks,

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.040
and our signature is the 'Soaring Unicorn'!

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.720
Whoa, what's going on?

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:33.720
Why are there so many people?!

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:34.600
I have no clue,

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.320
- but let's thank heaven first.
- Right.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.280
Sadhu!

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.240
Time waits for no one.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.320

You take care of the customers.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.600
- I need to take care of something.
- Okay.

- Come on in.
- Please!

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.760
- Drink as much as you want.
- You can even take pics.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.520
- This bar is run by women.
- Of course.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.640
Thank you, hotties.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.880
I don't know where you're from,

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.200
but I really appreciate you.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.600
- My pleasure.
- Handsome!

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.320
"Angels"?

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.640
They really told you that?

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:08.760
It's true.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:12.040
At first, I didn't believe
they were real angels,

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.560
but I pulled their hair,

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.720
- and nothing came out!
- Whoa!

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:20.960
I bit their nails,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:21.920
and they wouldn't budge!

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.240
Those are exactly
the signs of an angelic presence.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:38.120
You know, that day, sales totaled

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:39.580
around 20,000 baht!

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.720
- Whoa, 20,000!
- You tell her.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.440
Does it work that well?

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:45.920
It totally does.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.960
But you gotta have some merits with you.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.400
Otherwise, I can't guarantee it.

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:55.960
Is that legit?

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.400
Alright, I'll give you one more chance.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.800
Don't disappoint me.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:32.680
Copy!

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.320
The mission to destroy all grime

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.200
starts now!

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.360
Just start already!

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.600
Hey, that's for the toilet bowl!

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.280
Gosh, I'm gonna pass out.

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.240
- Are you?
- Don't!

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:51.920
Are you alright?!

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.600
Don't! Ew, it touched my head now!

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.880
Just get out!

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:56.920
Don't touch me!

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:57.880
Don't!

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:04.560
Typically, it only takes me
an hour to clean the whole house.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.400
Look at this.
Two rooms for the entire day?!

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.480
I'm sorry.

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.240
I've never really gotten
to use mops or toilet brushes...

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.000
How did you make it this far?

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:21.640
There's one room left.

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:24.680
I'll help you clean it.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.560
Hey! No!

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.040
Step back. I'll take care of this one.

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:48.620
Okay.

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.640
I promise to keep this a secret.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.680
Nobody's gonna know.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.760
Get out!

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.000
- I can help...
- Get out!

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:25.680
Did I really just let
a random stranger clean my whole house?

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:30.800
A little tiring, but worth it, huh?

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:37.880
Worth it, my ass!

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.180
It's even more tiring!

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:41.680
Chill,

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:42.480
alright?

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:51.220
Going to bed!

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:55.560
Hey!

00:25:58.180 --> 00:25:59.080
Where are you going?

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.620
Well, you said,

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:02.800
"Going to bed!"

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.100
So I'm doing the same.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.520
I mean,

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.960
I'm going to bed.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.840
'Cause this is my house,

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.840
and that's my bed!

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:17.640
Then, where am I gonna sleep?!

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:21.480
I don't know!

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.480
Me neither!

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:34.560
Now, I do.

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.020
Hey!

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:37.980
No way!

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.160
Why?

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:41.520
Bye-bye!

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:21.800
Whoa!

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.400
Get up.

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:45.360
And go.

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:54.150
Go!

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:48.120
This house?

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:49.000
Yes.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.880
Today, we have a big mission to complete:

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:09.040
a shio pan baking trial run
for my dream store.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.680
- Yay!
- Yay...

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:12.400
What are we cheering for?

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:17.770
So, what is shio pan?

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:19.720
It sounds really cute!

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:20.960
Did you name it?

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:24.640
Jeez, I didn't!

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:28.120
Shio pan is a type of bread
sprinkled with salt on top.

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.400
What's even more impressive

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.840
is that this is my special recipe!

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.400
Crunchy on the outside,
soft on the inside.

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:41.840
Not too sweet, not too salty.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:45.880
I guarantee everyone's gonna be hooked
if they try it.

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.400
That sounds pretty spectacular.

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:56.560
Of course.

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.520
It's my dream.

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:02.760
Opening my own bread shop
depends on this recipe,

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:06.020
and I've never been more confident in it!

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:16.400
Yesterday, your chores were kind of rough,

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.640
so I'm hoping you do better in the kitchen.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.280
Okay!

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:21.430
You can trust me!

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:31.680
At least there's no way my house
will catch on fire, right?

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.280
Definitely not!

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.440
No way...

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:07.280
Pass me some more flour.

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:09.780
Which one?

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.400
That one.

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:14.840
Let me open it for you.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.720
I'm sorry...

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:00.640
There.

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:08.720
Okay.

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:10.440
Now show me.

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.000
Mm, not bad. That's about it.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.320
Keep kneading. I'll be back.

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:23.280
Okay!

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:36.560
Hey!

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:38.580
What are you doing?!

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.720
Kneading the dough, apparently.

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:44.520
Ugh, that's not how it's done!

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:48.240
I told you to go easy on it.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.200
"Go easy."

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.520
Do you get it?

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.400
Alright, I'll do it again.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000
Easy...

00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:57.360
Stop it!

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.560
This batch won't work!

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.960
Who's gonna want to eat
when you knead with your elbow?

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.480
I'll eat it.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:06.720
Ew.

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.760
Whoa...

00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:10.200
Oh, you puffy...

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:10.840
Hey!

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:12.840
Don't touch it.

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:33.680
Keep an eye on it.

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:41.080
"Keep an eye on it."

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.360
Why does it take so long?

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:50.810
Maybe we can turn the temp up a bit

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.320
to make it bake faster.

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.120
Argh!

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.480
Whoa!

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.360
Apart from that sunny smile,
what else can you do?

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.440
Be real with me.

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:07.760
If you can't do anything,

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.960
why did those above send you to me?

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.280
It's because you didn't have many points.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.240
Huh?

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.920
Well, you just asked for someone, didn't you?

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:22.640
So those above sent me here

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:27.440
because I was the only one
who cost 1,200 points a month.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.840
Since you have 3,600 points,

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.800
I can spend three months with you.

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:40.200
Maybe if you'd requested
someone skilled in baking,

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:43.040
they would've sent one.

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:46.600
That is, if you have enough points.

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:54.480
So why are you the only one
who costs 1,200 points a month?

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:59.320
That's because
I was the cheapest one in the lot.

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:02.380
What do you mean?

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:06.000
My name is Z, like the letter 'Zed,'

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.440
the last letter of the alphabet.

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.120
If you want the top one,

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.240
that'd be A, B, or C.

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.120
So...

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:26.320
I'll help you clean the kitchen.

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.200
So I got the bargain-bin pick?

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:01.280
Goodbye, bargain-bin pick.

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:02.160
[Confirm]

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:55.400
Stupid app!

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.960
[Your request to return the wish
has been submitted; waiting for approval]

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:21.640
Don't be alarmed.

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:25.480
Who are you, pop?!

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.080
If you come any closer, I'll scream.

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:29.280
There are a lot of cops around here.

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:45.400
Doesn't taking off my glasses
make me look more pleasant?

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:47.080
Nuh-uh.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.280
I'm here to talk to you about Z, Miss.

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:52.600
Z?

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:54.700
Who's that?

00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:55.720
And who are you calling "Miss"?

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:59.720
The Z you returned to us this morning, Miss.

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:01.840
What do you mean, pop?

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:04.280
Could you please call me by my name?

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:05.880
I'm Duang-Jai.

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:08.000
At least call me uncle, not pop.

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:09.360
Okay,

00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:10.960
uncle.

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.480
I'm from the Lucky Points application.

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:17.320
I don't usually engage
with users directly,

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:19.200
but when it comes to Z,

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:23.720
could you please
reconsider your decision?

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.360
Why?

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:31.240
Here's the thing.

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:34.160
Z is scared of ghosts.

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:35.760
Ghosts?!

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:39.080
Because she couldn't complete your mission,

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:40.760
she was demoted!

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:44.560
Why are you pointing at me?

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:48.440
Please touch your finger to mine,

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.960
and I'll show you the condition she's in.

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:55.280
Just touch my finger,

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.280
like they do in E.T.

00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.040
For Z.

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:31.160
Step forward, please.

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:45.200
Only just dead.

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:48.960
Please proceed inside.

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:50.280
No!

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:52.680
I'll wash my face and go see my child!

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.480
You can wash up after you go inside.

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:01.840
I'm not dead, liar!

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.040
Please, just come on in.

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:11.680
There!

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:14.240
That's blood...

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:21.440
Before Z became a user's assistant,

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.640
she worked her way up from this position.

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.400
When she was first promoted,

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.960
her code even started with an N.

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:31.920
But she barely fulfilled any wishes,

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:34.400
so she kept getting bumped down

00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:36.680
until she became the bargain-bin pick
you called her.

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:40.240
Please leave me alone, guys.

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:41.720
Please spare me...

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.320
Whoa, Z!

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.320
Run faster!

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:57.760
Aren't we gonna give her a hand?

00:41:58.600 --> 00:41:59.520
That's not possible.

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:01.640
Even I don't have a say in this.

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:04.560
Let's now go.

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:16.560
As you saw,

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.960
Z is suffering in this position.

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:24.400
But I returned her to the app...

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:26.120
What do I do now?

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:27.600
Take a look over here.

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.180
When an angel fails a mission,

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:33.040
they're sent back to the app's recycle bin.

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:35.360
If the user changes their mind,

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:39.640
they have up to 48 hours
to request the wish back,

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:42.160
on probation for one month.

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:45.280
If the user insists on
returning the wish after that,

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:48.680
the return becomes permanent.

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:50.600
Hm...

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:54.280
Whoa!

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:56.760
Where did he go?!

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:02.480
[Reclaim the wish...]

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:12.500
What's the matter with her?

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:17.920
What did you find

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:20.240
that's making you sigh like that?

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:24.320
It's nothing, Izzy.

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:25.680
You sure?

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:26.680
Mm!

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:29.400
Girl, you're being sus.

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:36.600
[Reclaim the wish under probation]

00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:37.910
- Boo!
- Whoa!

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:39.960
Gosh.

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:42.360
Why did you have to scare me like that?

00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:46.400
Well, you've been staring at it
like it's gonna grow legs.

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.600
You're ruining your eyesight!

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:50.240
Facts. I thought you got your heart broken.

00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:52.960
Jeez, heartbroken?

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:53.840
I didn't!

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:55.080
Aha.

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:57.240
- Wait...
- Just don't get caught.

00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.120
- Exactly.
- I'm not!

00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:59.320
Right, sis?

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:00.840
- She does seem weird today.
- Doesn't she?

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.280
That's for sure.

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:04.200
She has that fishy look.

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:05.640
- She does have it.
- Mm.

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.210
Hey...

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:12.000
Do we have any customers like this?

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:13.280
My thoughts exactly!

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:14.840
I've never seen her before.

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:31.040
Z!

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:50.480
Hi again, Jane.

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:53.520
Hi.

00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:56.440
I'm sorry I misbehaved

00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:58.200
and that you had to send me back.

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:01.080
Oh...

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:04.200
It's all good.

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:08.400
That's her lover!

00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:43.480
Whoa!

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:45.680
How did you get in here?

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:49.960
You didn't lock the door today.

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.120
But this is my bedroom!

00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:59.080
Can't I just share a bed with you?

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:02.280
The couch downstairs is old,

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:03.560
and it's covered in dust.

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:08.160
Pwease?

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:09.560
Pwease lemme sleep here!

00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:24.320
Give it back!

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:33.080
So that settles it.

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:35.960
Don't cross the bolster.

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:37.480
And no snoring!

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:39.680
If I hear even the tiniest bit,

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:41.880
you can go share the dusty couch.

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:44.560
No worries,

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:46.120
I'm not gonna fall asleep.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.040
Why not?

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:50.880
I'm not sleepy.

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:53.120
Well, why not?!

00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:54.240
Look at the time!

00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:57.920
This body doesn't need sleep

00:46:58.360 --> 00:46:59.560
or rest.

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:01.680
"This body"?

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:06.560
Ohh...

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:10.440
Okay, I got it.

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:12.840
Thank you...

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:17.080
for letting me back on probation.

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:20.760
Mm.

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:22.640
It's fine.

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:26.360
This time,

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:28.560
do your best at your work.

00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:37.080
I'm going to sleep.

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:38.000
You should, too.

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:41.560
I told you that I couldn't!

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:47.680
Then consider this my order.

00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:50.040
Go to sleep.

00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:51.440
Okie!

00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:56.000
Okay.

00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:58.480
I'm gonna doze off now.

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:16.640
I told you to sleep!

00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:32.040
Alright, I'll try baking shio pan
one more time.

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:32.760
Mm!

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:35.400
Then, I'll have those at the bar try it.

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:39.720
Sure! I'll do my best to help.

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:45.040
I hope your approach to helping
is different from the other day.

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:47.680
Okay.

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:50.720
But it's fine.

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:53.280
We're not putting out any fire today!

00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:54.560
Copy that, boss!

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:56.360
Yay!

00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:57.720
Let's go!

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:17.600
♫You're as lovely as the galaxy♫

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:20.520
♫My heart's paper-thin♫

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:24.320
♫When you smile at me♫

00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:36.920
Whoa!

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:39.720
Your vocals are insane!

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:42.800
Well,

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:44.720
when you hummed the song earlier,

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:45.880
that was beautiful!

00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:47.880
I don't know what you mean.

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:51.960
Or could it be?!

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:55.760
Maybe you were a singer
before you passed away!

00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:57.920
Me? A singer?

00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:58.680
Mm!

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.000
That's nonsense.

00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:03.280
Finally, we found one thing
you're really good at.

00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:04.240
One thing!

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:06.520
- One thing?
- Mm-hm!

00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:07.560
Yay...

00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:10.240
I've been baking for so long...

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:11.960
Thanks.

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.880
Beautiful vocals...

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:21.400
Wait!

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:27.720
You good?

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:37.640
The Six Degrees of Separation theory,

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.840
also known as the Small-World Phenomenon.

00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:42.760
Oh!

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:45.080
What's that?

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:46.560
Ugh!

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:56.800
This is my junior-year project
for Mass Communication.

00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:03.400
It's a theory that says
no matter how far apart people are,

00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:06.440
there's a connection between them
through six people or fewer.

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:10.080
What if we use this theory
to find your old identity?

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:12.720
Through people you used to know,

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:14.560
people who heard you sing,

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:17.960
or even people who might
remember who you were!

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:24.320
I think we'll definitely find out
who you were

00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:28.080
if we use the six degrees correctly.

00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:30.640
That means...

00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:33.280
I'll finally know

00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:35.360
who I actually am.

00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:46.120
Yes!

00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:49.480
I'll make sure I find it!

00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:54.120
But don't think that I'll be nice to you.

00:51:56.560 --> 00:52:00.040
Since I'm stuck with you

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:01.560
for at least a month,

00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:03.800
I might as well get something out of it.

00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:08.640
Who knows? Maybe you were a doctor

00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:10.600
or a lawyer!

00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:11.760
You're right!

00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:18.200
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:26.440
Six Degrees, my ass.

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:30.600
Nope, I'm out.

00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:43.640
Jin, my No. 1 connection.

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:46.240
I need your help.

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:49.800
I think I know who you're looking for.

00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:51.280
There's no one else.

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:53.520
Why are you here talking about angels?

00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:55.000
That's nonsense.

00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:58.880
That heavy wolf cut
is so last decade

00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:00.080
You're dressing funny.

00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:01.280
Your hair was just short yesterday.

00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:02.120
- Shit!
- Shit!

00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:03.480
Whoa,

00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:05.160
why is it like this?

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:06.520
Are you fucking crazy, bro?!

00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:11.240
That angel's voice sounds familiar to me.

00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:14.160
If you wanna know where I recognized it from,
come help me with my work.

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:14.840
Periodt!

00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:18.520
That! That's it! On point!
