00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.100
In the Western , fruit has never been just food

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.000
it has also been a symbol of desire

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.400
The apple represents original sin

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.800
in the legend of Adam and Eve.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.700
Grapes symbolize prosperity and celebration.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.400
And the peach became a symbol of the body.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.000
Seduction

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.900
Linguistic studies suggest that

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.700
“peach” has long been used as a term for a beautiful lover.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.900
Desire

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.200
In today’s digital world

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.500
the peach emoji

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.500
has evolved into a coded symbol of lust

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.700
and the buttocks, as everyone understands

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.600
The question is

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.000
When someone sends you a peach emoji

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.900
Does he simply mean fruit

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.000
or is he making an offer that could change your life forever?

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.900
I look at the growing balance in my account with satisfaction

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.000
My bold decision to raise the commission rate for this job

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.700
It received a very positive response from clients.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.300
As the work quality increased

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.100
higher returns were only to be expected

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.699
I’ll be moving out of here soon

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.300
and leave this country

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.800
a country I no longer know who I’m staying here for

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.000
Tonight’s dinner is convenience store microwave food again

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.500
I’m not trying to save

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.300
I’m just too tired to go far

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.600
I worked all night

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.500
And then there was the wait for the writer to make revisions

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.500
Before I knew it, it was afternoon

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.600
If I drove into the city to eat right now, I’d probably fall asleep at the wheel

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.700
After dealing with the tasteless microwave food

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.500
Then I spent some time letting it settle before taking a shower

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.200
while accepting a new job from a regular client

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.800
Most are from publishers I’ve done cover work for

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.400
They’re getting books ready for the book fair season

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.200
Just watch

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.600
there’ll be tons of covers by me this time

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.600
Now that I think about it, there’s been a surge in BL novel cover jobs

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.200
I understand it’s a genre that’s gaining popularity

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.400
And just look at the briefs I’ve been getting

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.200
the bodies

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Muscles everywhere

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.200
Every image the writer attached

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.000
They left my mouth dry, my throat suddenly tight

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.200
They really knew how to pick them

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.300
You’re really cute, Peach

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.800
He always starts his videos like this

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.800
Peach Lover

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.000
A popular account on a gay adult website

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.700
Followed by hundreds of thousands

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.600
He calls his partner

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.700
Peach

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.300
Even though it’s only a nickname

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.300
Do you like it, Peach?

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.600
I like it

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.100
Want me harder?

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.400
Harder, please

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.300
Damn!

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.200
Who the hell?

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.700
This is such a mood killer

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.500
Hello , everyone

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.500
It’s been a long time, hasn’t it?

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.900
Have you guys forgotten me?

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.400
The reason I disappeared

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.600
because I broke up with Peach

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.900
Broke up

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.500
How did they break up?

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
But I’m coming back

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.400
the reason I’m back today

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.900
because I’m now accepting applications for new Peach

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:38.300
If you’re interested, all the details are in the description under the video

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Opening up for new Peaches?

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.500
So

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.700
the chosen one

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.000
actually get to meet him… for real

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.500
skipping the shower!

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.500
My name’s… Po

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.500
I’m a novel cover artist

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.700
let them choose me

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.500
Please

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.900
Forget the work!

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.600
Meeting him tomorrow… really?!

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.300
Hello

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.100
Hello

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.900
I need to go up to room… 1403

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:45.600
Alright, sir. Just a moment, please

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.100
Yes

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.000
You’re Po, right?

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:30.800
Yes , I'm Po

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.500
Please, take a seat in this room for a moment

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:33.400
Yes

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.100
Wait…

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.300
May I ask you something?

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.400
Sure...

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.300
but I can’t promise I’ll have an answer

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.500
Your boss

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000
is he a nice person?

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.900
It’s better if you, decide for yourself.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.000
Fianlly

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.900
I'm going to meet the real Peach Lover

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:45.800
So

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.700
Am I excited… or scared?

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.000
He’s here…

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.400
I’m finally seeing his face

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.400
I didn’t expect

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.400
Peach Lover would do it like this

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:43.900
Hello

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.600
H..Hello

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.100
What are you thinking?

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.700
I’m thinking…

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:05.900
You…

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.400
have got an amazing body

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.500
Love it

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.100
Your name’s Po, right?

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.200
Yes

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.500
I'm Po

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.800
Are you sure

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.100
to be my new Peach?

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.700
Yes, I’m sure

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.400
Why not try another path?

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.100
You’re good-looking

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.800
Me? Good-looking?

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.500
In my whole life

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.200
no one’s ever told me I’m good-looking

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.000
How could anyone call me handsome

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.600
you’re the one with the sweet face

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.500
But you have to be on camera

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.900
Are you okay with that?

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:36.600
I'm okay

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.700
Are you sure?

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.500
I'm sure

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.400
You’re really a strange one

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.200
Then...

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.400
I think I’ll have to taste you

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.700
To help me decide

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.500
Take your shirt off for me

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:48.500
You…

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.500
Truth is…

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.400
I’ve never been with anyone

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.300
Sasom!

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:27.100
a person I’ve seen on billboards

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.400
TV

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.000
Every time I see him

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.400
I feel like he’s someone out of my reach

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:37.700
I used to think… what if Peach Lover showed his face?

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.700
It would probably be someone...handsome

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:44.000
But it’s not the person in front of me… it’s not him

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:45.500
Why...?

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:48.300
Why do I always stop… and stare whenever I see him?

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.700
The moment I knew it was him… my heart nearly stopped

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:57.800
In

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.600
takes Po back

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:02.400
Yes

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.600
Where should I call the car to, Po?

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:23.300
Po

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:26.800
Po

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:39.300
Here, please

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:42.600
Thank you

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:46.800
Wait..Po

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.000
What?

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.100
My boss… he’s kind of pitiful

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.100
What do you mean?

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:08.600
When you asked me

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.000
If my boss is a nice person

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:15.200
Actually… he’s really a pitiful person

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:19.100
So...

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:22.300
Please keep his story a secret

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:29.100
I’m not going to reveal Peach Lover’s secret, anyway

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:31.600
okay

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:41.700
Even if anyone’s watching, there’s nothing to worry about

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:04.800
handsome

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.300
so damn handsome

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.400
So clean… must shower ten times a day

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:10.900
Just by smiling… or not smiling

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.100
He’s like a whole different person

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.100
But his eyes…

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.100
fierce

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:19.400
It’s frightening

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000
:01
draws you in

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:22.300
Yes

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:25.400
This is the one who kissed me with a burning tongue

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:30.000
He’s been well-known since he was a teen… and now he’s at the top

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:31.900
Damn… I shouldn’t have

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:35.100
I shouldn’t have ripped off his mask

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.400
A body like that

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:44.800
My Peach Lover

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.200
The one I’ve always dreamed about

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.300
It's crezy

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.400
I’m going crazy because of that man

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:33.000
I’m crazy about you

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.100
I’m so in love it’s driving me crazy, and I don’t know what to do with my heart anymore

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.400
Sasom...

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.100
You make me feel lost

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.300
But I don’t even want to find my way out

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:09.600
Damn it

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:14.000
I never thought I’d be this unable to stop watching

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:17.700
Sasom is such a great actor

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:21.100
His acting feels so natural

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:22.800
Everything looks perfect

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:25.500
It’s no surprise he’s earned so many awards

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.300
Stay here, In

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:53.200
Yes

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.700
Sasom

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:06.400
Who?

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.000
Sasom

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.300
May I come in

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:38.700
Sure

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.300
Did I act well? it was really fun filming it

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:08.400
Alright

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:14.500
But I like your series on iQIYI more

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.300
you’ve already finished that series?

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.200
I’ve only seen half of it

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:24.100
Yes

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.000
It’s finished

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000
So

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:33.100
Am I bothering you

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:34.900
No

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:38.700
I was just about to take a break

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:42.400
Sorry

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:47.600
What are you apologizing for?

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:50.900
About that day I sent you back

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.900
No problem

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:56.200
It was my fault

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:03.300
I shouldn’t have taken your mask off

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.800
This isn’t a competition to find a winner

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:10.700
Yes

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:15.700
Would you like to sit down first?

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:17.700
Good

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.000
Honestly

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.500
I was really shocked that day

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:59.100
The moment I realized you were still a virgin

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.100
It's...

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:10.900
really that bad?

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:14.699
It’s not like that

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:17.100
I just didn’t think you were still a virgin

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:19.699
That’s why I was shocked

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:23.100
Think about it

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:25.800
you actually filmed with me

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:28.199
and even dared to show your face on camera

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:34.000
Who would’ve thought you’d have no experience yet?

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:43.199
but...

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:46.000
I’m curious

00:34:48.699 --> 00:34:49.800
You

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.400
Why did you come here

00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:58.300
First

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:01.300
I'm here to say sorry

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:06.800
and...

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:11.100
the second?

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:15.700
second

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:21.800
I just want to ask you

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.800
Do you still want to be my Peach?

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:37.800
Yes, I do

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:43.300
but

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:47.400
Can I ask you something?

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:53.300
How did you become Peach Lover…?

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:54.400
I mean

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:57.700
I’m not saying it’s a bad thing

00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.900
but

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.800
you’re a well-known star too

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:06.200
So many people love you

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.200
That doesn’t seem like you

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:18.900
Not like me?

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.700
Or not like the image people expect me to have?

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.700
Peach Lover not by chance

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.200
It’s a place I chose myself

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:42.900
Could have been anyone

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:47.500
Could have been to love anyone

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.200
the way I wanted

00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:58.400
I’m just…

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.600
a person born into a family where my parents never loved me

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.200
Everything was just about money

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:09.400
Even my name…

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.900
was an investment

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:13.900
A life forced

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:19.800
pushing me to find an escape

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.200
But in the end there was no escaping

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:28.100
That’s why

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:31.200
I need a place where I feel safe

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:37.700
and Peach Lover

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:39.800
that my safe space

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.900
The only place that makes me happy

00:37:58.500 --> 00:37:59.000
I...

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:02.200
feel the same

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.400
I’ve never told anyone I like guys

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:17.500
Every time I think about it

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.500
I feel guilty

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.900
I feel like there’s something wrong with me

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.700
But when I saw Peach Lover through the camera

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.700
It was like someone was telling me

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:40.300
What I am

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.700
It’s not wrong

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.200
That’s why

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:52.900
I’m here

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:56.200
It’s not because of the money

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:59.000
Or… it’s not because I like trying strange things, either

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:05.200
I just...

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:10.400
want to understand my own feelings

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:20.000
more

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.200
Sasom

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.200
if you’re free

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:54.300
could you teach me?

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:02.900
Sure

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:08.500
I’ll teach you myself

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.500
All this time

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:07.300
I’ve been able to guess what you want almost every time

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:12.800
But today… it’s different

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.100
Staying the night here

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:26.000
with someone I just met?

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:30.500
Po

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:33.000
don’t seem ordinary

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:02.800
Take it off

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.100
Anything I’ve decided to do

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.600
I’ll never change my mind.

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:22.000
I’ll make you feel better

00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:34.900
You’re my new Peach… from now on

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:36.500
I never imagined

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:41.000
a Peach Lover would take care of me like this

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:44.500
Because you’re my Peach

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:13.000
Who the hell did you sleep with?

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:16.000
Can I ask you something?

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:18.200
Do whatever you want

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:20.100
but don’t mess with your dad, okay?

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:20.000
When I was a kid

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:23.300
I used to think my feelings were wrong

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:26.100
ผมโตมาในบ้านที่พ่อไม่เคยมองหน้า

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:28.600
A home where shouting happened every day

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.200
A house where I couldn’t tell anyone

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:33.400
that I liked men

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:35.300
So I grew up with silence

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:37.200
in dark rooms

00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:39.000
the only place

00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:41.600
where I could hide what my heart truly felt

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.600
I never felt like I had any worth

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:49.000
Until someone

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:52.200
ooked at me like no one had looked at me before

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:55.300
My taste isn't sex

00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:59.000
But it's my wish

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.400
That there will be people seeing me in the dark side

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:04.000
On the day I was the most empty-hearted

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:07.700
Today

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:10.000
I don't have to hide anymore

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:16.100
everyone think I'm perfect

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:17.800
But no one

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:19.300
saw that the child

00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:22.600
I've been caught standing in front of the camera since I can remember

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:26.300
No one asked what I wanted to be

00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:27.800
What do you want to like

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:30.000
What do I want to be ?

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:34.200
My name

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:36.400
is still the name my father gave me

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:38.800
to be able to sell

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:42.300
I never choose anything on my own

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:45.800
So I had to create my own safe space

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:48.600
Where I don't have to be a product

00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:51.100
don't have to smile on command

00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:55.200
Where I can be a normal person

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:57.500
A place that has the same needs as everyone else

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:02.600
My taste is not in control

00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:06.200
But it was freedom for the first time in my life

00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:10.700
The first time I got to choose for myself

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:12.700
Who do I want to see?

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:13.200
I wanted to love someone

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:20.400
and I chose him

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:33.800
You are listening to the program

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:35.800
"Our Hearts"

00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:38.800
Weekly advice session from a psychiatrist

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.800
Today the doctor will talk about

00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:46.200
The impact of the love we never received since childhood

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:50.000
in psychology

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.400
Children growing up in an unstable environment

00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:56.600
They often create their own safe space

00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:59.500
Whether it's a work of art

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:00.800
games

00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:02.400
online society

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:05.200
or some secret channel

00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:07.400
It's not wrong

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:10.800
But it is a survival mechanism of the mind

00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:14.600
Some people may have different love styles

00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:16.900
like confidence

00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:19.000
I like being seen

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.600
or feel safe

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000
When you have control over your own situation

00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:26.400
This kind of taste

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.700
is not perversion

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.200
It's not a dark secret

00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:33.300
But it's an echo

00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:35.700
of emotional wounds

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:37.600
that needs acceptance

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:41.500
As long as the relationship is based on consent

00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:44.800
Respect and Integrity

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:47.600
It's a form of love

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:50.400
That has a meaning that is no different from anyone else's

00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:54.300
And sometimes meeting someone

00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:57.100
who understands our wounds

00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:59.300
It helps heal the whole heart

00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:04.300
and help us dare to be ourselves more

00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:11.500
Because in the end, love is safe

00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:14.100
It's not perfect love

00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:16.300
But it is love that makes us...

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:20.600
No need to hide who we are anymore

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:34.900
I saw it in your application

00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:36.200
Do you draw pictures too?

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:37.200
Yes

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:39.400
I really want to have friends as a artist

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:43.700
So...can you be a model for me?

00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:47.600
In case you have an artist as a friend

00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:49.900
Can I ask you somthing?

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:51.800
You can do anything

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.600
But don't you dare disrespect your father
