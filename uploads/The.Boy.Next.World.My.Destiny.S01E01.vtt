00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.570
Just disappear.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:08.810
Damn it.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.770
- That's impressive.
- Right?

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.900
I'm actually kind of into it.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.360
The car is right there.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.830
- Thanks.
- Yeah, get home safe.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.270
Seriously... (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.010
I'm soaked to the bone.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.930
Why is it pouring like this?

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.990
Is this some kind of bad omen...?

"The Boy Next World My Destiny"
(Episode 1)

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.770
Staring at me while I sleep again?

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.160
Even though my face
and hair are a total mess.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:12.950
No, they're not.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.780
Morning.

00:03:25.082 --> 00:03:26.082
Fuu.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.070
Ah!

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.140
It was just getting to the best part...

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.670
What was I just dreaming about?

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.160
Crap! ...Ow!

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.050
Hey, Fuu! Class is about to start.

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:18.658
Seriously, what are you doing?

00:04:18.683 --> 00:04:20.003
Looking for your underwear again?

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.229
Uh... no, I was just about to.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.920
(Lucky Color Chart)

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.890
Wednesday is orange.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.310
Hmm... lucky orange.

00:04:31.773 --> 00:04:34.003
Fuu, just skip the lucky color today.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.430
No way, I can't.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.109
Last time I didn't follow it,

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.689
I dropped the remote on my pinky toe

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.850
and ended up with a fracture.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.279
And before that, the
pencil sharpener incident...

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.030
The exam starts in twenty minutes.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:45.630
Wait, what?

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:46.790
Hey, Ren.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:47.830
What do you mean, exam?

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.260
A pop quiz.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.020
If you're late for no
reason, you'll fail the course.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:01.970
Are you serious?

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.140
Where did you hear that?

00:05:03.316 --> 00:05:04.965
Attention, everyone.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:06.680
Just a quick announcement.

00:05:07.486 --> 00:05:08.846
In twenty minutes,

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.140
we'll be having an exam.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.320
If you have friends who aren't here yet,

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.370
please contact them.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.690
If they don't make it in time,

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.300
they won't get credit.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:20.570
The professor

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:21.860
told me about it earlier.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.620
No way... I haven't studied at all.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.700
Fuu, if you're listening,
get here in twenty minutes!

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:28.870
This is the worst luck.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.220
Wait, what's wrong?

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.310
(Rental Expired)
That movie I rented yesterday...

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.930
I fell asleep halfway through.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.810
Just give it up.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.480
It's more expensive than usual.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:45.990
You shouted so suddenly,

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.360
I missed the turn.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:48.790
That's because...

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.530
a huge bug just flew in!

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.990
Huh?

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:57.720
Wait... where's my wallet?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
I'll use mobile pay.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.410
Crap, my battery.

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.090
Um...

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.630
Could I borrow your charger for a second?

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.170
Three days after the accident.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.390
His vitals are back to
normal. Everything looks fine.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.450
If everything's fine,

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.700
then why won't he wake up?

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.670
Let's just keep observing him for now.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:49.740
Hey.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:52.390
It's about time you woke up.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:54.630
Sara.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.150
Without Fuu, I might actually starve.

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:34.130
Aren't you exaggerating?

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.230
You were doing just fine before you met me.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.090
But we've already met,
so that's not an option.

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.830
At first, you didn't even have
the courage to hold my hand.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:47.700
Have you ever thought about it?

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.160
If Sara hadn't answered that day...

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:54.830
we'd be in a world where we never met...

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:04.090
I wouldn't be able to go on.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.950
Seriously... my luck
is at rock bottom today.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.559
If you weren't so obsessed
with your underwear color,

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.980
you wouldn't have almost been late.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:18.630
Don't you get it?

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.846
It's because the color was
wrong that I almost missed it.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:21.830
Because the color was wrong,

00:08:21.831 --> 00:08:23.430
my bike broke down this morning.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.739
A bug made the taxi fare go up,

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:26.780
and I lost my wallet.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.260
Even the limited edition curry bread
I always buy was sold out.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.459
And you fell asleep
during your movie, right?

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.660
Ugh, exactly.

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:37.070
Oh.

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.520
It's that movie about parallel worlds.

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.050
It sounds pretty interesting.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.260
It is!

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:45.910
The hero travels through
parallel worlds to fight evil.

00:08:46.193 --> 00:08:48.393
He stands for justice no
matter which timeline he's in.

00:08:50.617 --> 00:08:52.347
Though I don't know how it ends.

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:55.250
It's kind of like how things are now.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:57.180
But you know,

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.060
isn't Fuu's luck usually way too good?

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:01.829
- Huh?
- Seriously.

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:03.689
That limited edition
curry bread is super rare.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:05.446
- I've never even seen it in person.
- Right?

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:06.710
I wish I had some of your luck.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.626
I shared some with you before, didn't I?

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:09.770
Thanks for that, by the way.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:12.130
- It was delicious.
- I know, right?

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:13.550
I had some before too, but...

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.310
All that good luck

00:09:15.311 --> 00:09:17.550
is only because I stick to my lucky colors.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:21.720
But today...

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.240
Ah!

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.150
It's not even rainy season.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.100
Orange underwear.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.090
It's your fault I'm having such a bad day.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.030
I'm just kidding. I'll go
change them right away.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.780
Don't worry about me, just get better soon.

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.999
As long as my guardian angel is safe,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.440
that's all that matters.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.710
Yes, I'm going now.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:34.390
Wait a second. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.480
He might be trying his best too.

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:39.229
Don't say that when
you don't know anything.

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:41.800
Fuu, do you already have a college in mind?

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:07.580
Coming.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Fuu.

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:28.250
I'm so glad you're okay.

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:50.570
Um...

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:54.930
If you don't mind, please take this.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.440
Thank you, Fuu.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.250
Ah...

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:05.780
I can't believe Sara knows my name.

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:08.500
Isn't that obvious?

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:10.420
No, not at all.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:13.419
It's because you've been a
big deal since high school.

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.940
You're famous at uni too, so
of course I know who you are.

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.060
But what happened to you?

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.060
Is that all?

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:24.780
Huh?

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:30.190
To you, Fuu, am I...

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:33.800
just some senior?

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:40.480
You're the cool, popular
senior everyone knows.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:57.510
Hey.

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:01.060
Why are you crying...?

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:14.710
Fuu.

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:20.510
You and I are dating.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.680
What did you say?

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.850
We're a couple.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:31.930
Um...

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:34.310
I'm sorry, but...

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:36.870
I'm not really good at
reacting to surprises.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.360
It's the truth.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.320
No, no, no.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.809
If you said we were
dating in another world,

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:50.570
I might actually believe you.

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:53.250
No, I still can't wrap my head around it.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.200
Parallel worlds.

00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:59.289
I just watched a movie about that recently.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:00.849
Well, only half of it. Of course, I
don't actually believe in that stuff.

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:04.940
I didn't believe it either.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:13.860
But...

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.300
Hello?

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:38.330
Ah.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:40.800
I'm coming back now.

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:53.760
Thanks.

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:02.970
Wait.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.070
What did you mean by that?

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:10.090
If you don't believe me,
I don't want to scare you.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:11.700
But...

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.360
Fuu, you always keep your
wallet in your back pocket.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.410
If you lost it, check there.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:20.260
What...?

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:38.670
No way...

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:41.590
How did Sara know...?

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.440
Welcome back, Sara.

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:47.940
What is even real anymore?

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:52.540
What should I do...?

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:57.110
Fuu.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.970
No, stop.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:10.900
Don't think about it.

00:17:16.113 --> 00:17:17.113
Everything is fine today.

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:38.910
Hey, Ren.

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:42.310
I don't know.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:43.450
I haven't even asked you anything yet.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:44.776
I'm telling you, I don't know.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.800
Who sent it?

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:47.770
And why is it all of Fuu's favorite foods?

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.230
My favorite foods are pretty well-known.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.280
Even seniors I've never
talked to know them.

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:01.490
Wow, so pretty.

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:03.370
Maybe something good will happen.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:04.840
Ren.

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:05.980
Yeah?

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.160
- Listen to me.
- Hold on, I'm taking a picture.

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:09.860
- Hey, listen!
- I said hold on.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.320
Hey.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:13.546
- Hey.
- Oh, you scared me. It's just Adachi.

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:14.610
Hey, did you guys see him?

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:15.740
That beautiful prince.

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:17.330
What?

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:21.200
That elegant, model-like pose.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:23.379
The girls keep fixing their makeup

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.300
and walking back and forth in front of him.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:29.720
Ah.

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:30.950
He's coming this way.

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:31.720
Hey, what are you doing?

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:34.050
You're the one who called him a prince.

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:35.849
Why are you hiding?

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:38.200
It's like you're the one who summoned him.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.530
Hello.

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.970
Sara, we meet again.

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.940
This is the one you
couldn't get this morning.

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:56.730
- It's my favorite...
- I'll be going now.

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:01.080
Seriously, why?

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.200
Fuu, since when are you so
close with that gorgeous senior?

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.069
Is he feeding you now?

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:07.070
No, it's not like that.

00:19:12.015 --> 00:19:15.185
(Sara: It'll spill,
so make sure the lid is on tight.)

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:16.400
He even has my contact info!?

00:19:16.425 --> 00:19:19.425
(Also, even if you don't know me yet,
I'm not giving up. So brace yourself.)

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.240
What were you thinking?

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:31.690
What? (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:34.150
Running out of the hospital like that.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.480
Everyone was frantically looking for you.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.120
Sorry.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:39.730
I was just worried about my boyfriend.

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.420
You've been saying that
ever since you woke up.

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.120
Listen to me.

00:19:45.186 --> 00:19:46.746
This Fuu Yotsuba you're talking about...

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.440
As far as I know,
you've never even spoken a word to him.

00:19:50.836 --> 00:19:52.480
But Fuu is my lover.

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:54.810
We've been together since high school.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.630
Please, just go back to the hospital.

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:08.690
I'm perfectly fine.

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:13.690
If he doesn't know me,

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:17.210
then I'll just win him over all over again.

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:32.490
I was supposed to be lucky today...

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:37.420
Hmm...

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:39.330
Parallel worlds, huh?

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:42.250
I never thought of it from that angle.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.030
How am I supposed to believe that?

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:46.460
Someone I've never even met.

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:54.600
Maybe you have met,
but you just didn't notice?

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:56.300
Huh?

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:02.670
Thank you.

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:05.830
- Thanks for coming by so often.
- Thank you, ma'am.

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.710
Ren is always dropping these little hints.

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:11.650
He's such a hint-master.

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:14.870
Lucky you.

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:17.680
It's rare to see you two
here at the same time.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:19.820
But,

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:21.520
there's only one left.

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:23.760
I'll let him have it.

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:27.670
Here.

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:00.360
Just like Ren said,

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.650
maybe I just didn't notice him...?

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:14.970
Is he really...

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.430
my boyfriend...?

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:35.960
Morning, Fuu.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.320
Fuu!

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:48.330
Fuu, wait.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.560
Fuu!

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:55.150
Are you upset because I touched you?

00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:58.540
It's not that.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.640
Then why did you run away?

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.760
It's because...

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.990
you startled me.

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:17.790
Startled you how?

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:20.219
The way you said good morning.

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:22.420
It sounded like you've said
it a thousand times before.

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:25.000
And I've been seeing you everywhere lately.

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:27.070
Even though we only met a few days ago.

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:30.960
I'm sorry.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:32.320
Why are you apologizing?

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:39.630
To me, our relationship is more than this.

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:42.930
But

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:45.640
to you, Fuu...

00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:57.670
Well...

00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:59.370
Can we start over?

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:04.190
Huh?

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:07.320
I don't want to scare you,

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:09.650
or make you feel uncomfortable.

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:13.330
But...

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:15.610
I can't just let this go.

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:20.140
It's okay if you don't believe me yet.

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:22.780
For now,

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:25.160
I'll just be that popular senior to you.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.040
In exchange,

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.270
can I ask you for one thing?

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:38.150
One thing...?

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:55.190
Let me court you.

00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:04.450
Please let me pursue you,
to make you my boyfriend,

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:47.350
Fuu, are you okay?

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:48.910
Huh?

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:50.110
Fuu?

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.360
I'll go get the doctor. Just wait here.

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:56.980
It's Fuu.

00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.790
My lover...

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:01.950
Fuu Yotsuba.

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:06.810
Get some rest for now.

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:05.310
