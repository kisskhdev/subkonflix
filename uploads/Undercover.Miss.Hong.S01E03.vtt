WEBVTT

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:38.059
{\an8}UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

00:00:39.018 --> 00:00:40.687
The Witch of Yeouido is coming.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.898
{\an8}You have been promoted to team manager
at the Financial Supervisory Service,

00:00:43.982 --> 00:00:47.110
and confirmed probe into the slush fund
of Hanmin Investment & Securities.

00:00:47.193 --> 00:00:49.571
The prosecution
and Financial Supervisory Service

00:00:49.654 --> 00:00:51.072
have already formed a task force team.

00:00:51.155 --> 00:00:51.990
HANMIN'S DECADE-LONG ALLEGATIONS

00:00:53.324 --> 00:00:54.158
"Yehppee"?

00:00:54.242 --> 00:00:55.660
Yehppee and I

00:00:55.743 --> 00:00:58.121
are getting the ledger together
for whistleblowing purposes.

00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:00.165
You can pick up the slush fund ledger

00:01:00.248 --> 00:01:03.626
at the president's office
on the 12th floor in Hanmin's head office.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.379
You could end up receiving
a prison sentence.

00:01:06.462 --> 00:01:08.214
Yes. I'm prepared for as much.

00:01:09.174 --> 00:01:11.050
{\an8}- Is it not there?
- This can't be.

00:01:11.134 --> 00:01:12.719
Maybe someone at Hanmin

00:01:12.802 --> 00:01:15.972
found out about you and President Kang?

00:01:16.055 --> 00:01:17.849
This is undoubtedly a warning.

00:01:17.932 --> 00:01:18.892
Keum-bo!

00:01:19.392 --> 00:01:20.852
Go undercover as some entry-level minion?

00:01:20.935 --> 00:01:23.062
They wouldn't imagine you doing this
in their wildest dreams.

00:01:23.146 --> 00:01:24.063
All right, sorry.

00:01:24.147 --> 00:01:26.107
I mean, you're 35.

00:01:26.191 --> 00:01:28.318
Who would ever think
you're in your twenties?

00:01:28.401 --> 00:01:31.112
I'll proceed
with the Hanmin undercover investigation.

00:01:31.195 --> 00:01:33.448
I'll find Yehppee within three months

00:01:33.531 --> 00:01:35.700
and retrieve the slush fund ledger.

00:01:35.783 --> 00:01:38.536
Let's hurry up.
The president is waiting for us.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.830
It's not like he's waiting out
in the hot sun.

00:01:40.914 --> 00:01:42.165
The three Yehppee candidates are

00:01:42.248 --> 00:01:45.293
So Gyeong-dong,
Bang Jin-mok, and Cha Jung-il.

00:01:45.376 --> 00:01:47.545
His assistant will have to know

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:49.005
who Yehppee is.

00:01:49.088 --> 00:01:51.591
Befriend that assistant
and just get the intel you need.

00:01:51.674 --> 00:01:52.884
Then focus on finding Yehppee.

00:01:52.967 --> 00:01:54.844
What's with the loitering?

00:01:54.928 --> 00:01:56.971
Please welcome President Shin Jung-woo.

00:01:57.055 --> 00:01:58.348
Hello.

00:01:58.431 --> 00:02:00.391
I'm Shin Jung-woo.

00:02:00.475 --> 00:02:03.353
Ms. Hong, you've been appointed
as President Shin's new assistant.

00:02:03.937 --> 00:02:06.105
Who says the new president
will have a new assistant?

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.068
Who would you say the late President Kang
was closest to at the company?

00:02:10.151 --> 00:02:13.529
If there was a general manager
he was close to, they might help you out.

00:02:13.613 --> 00:02:16.324
Come on. Who would help out
an assistant with no boss?

00:02:17.784 --> 00:02:18.618
I could come with you.

00:02:18.701 --> 00:02:19.744
We're roommates.

00:02:20.286 --> 00:02:21.120
How about this?

00:02:21.955 --> 00:02:25.333
You swoop in and show President Shin
how capable an assistant you are.

00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:30.380
Not a single person here
can answer my question?

00:02:30.463 --> 00:02:32.590
These are anticipated Q&As
for the chairman.

00:02:32.674 --> 00:02:33.758
Must read!

00:02:33.841 --> 00:02:35.009
I hope this works out.

00:02:35.093 --> 00:02:37.720
That means I can continue working

00:02:37.804 --> 00:02:39.597
- as your assistant, right?
- Yes.

00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:40.515
Thanks.

00:02:40.598 --> 00:02:43.101
I spent all night racking my brain,
wondering if I should visit Mr. So

00:02:43.184 --> 00:02:44.477
with a box of expensive ribs.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.771
You mean Mr. So Gyeong-dong
in the Trading Division?

00:02:46.854 --> 00:02:48.273
President Kang's mentor

00:02:48.356 --> 00:02:49.983
and a well-respected,
seasoned veteran in Hanmin.

00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:51.317
He's got to be Yehppee.

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:52.694
There's something fishy.

00:02:53.277 --> 00:02:55.113
How can you trust her?

00:02:55.697 --> 00:02:56.614
You mean Go Bok-hee?

00:03:02.328 --> 00:03:03.162
Damn it.

00:04:33.544 --> 00:04:35.254
Why does he work in the dark?

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:37.715
My poor heart.

00:04:59.946 --> 00:05:00.863
Keum-bo.

00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:02.615
Hong Keum-bo.

00:05:10.998 --> 00:05:12.250
Have we met, mister?

00:05:14.335 --> 00:05:16.796
May I ask you what your name is?

00:05:17.588 --> 00:05:19.298
What do you want my name for?

00:05:20.007 --> 00:05:21.801
You can't have my beeper number.

00:05:21.884 --> 00:05:23.052
I have a boyfriend.

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:27.140
Wait, I…

00:05:50.288 --> 00:05:51.664
Ta-da.

00:05:54.292 --> 00:05:56.711
Hong Keum-bo, Shin Jung-woo.

00:06:00.214 --> 00:06:01.257
Here.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.842
That's yours,

00:06:03.426 --> 00:06:04.510
and this is mine.

00:06:04.594 --> 00:06:07.346
Every time you're struggling
with a hard decision,

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.598
I'll be by your side.

00:06:10.558 --> 00:06:13.561
And every time you have
an important decision to make,

00:06:13.644 --> 00:06:15.271
I'll be waiting with you.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.278
- Keum-bo.
- Yeah?

00:06:23.738 --> 00:06:26.407
We should tell our seniors and colleagues

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.117
about our relationship, right?

00:06:29.368 --> 00:06:30.786
We should keep it a secret.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.288
I'll deny it all.

00:06:32.371 --> 00:06:33.247
I'm not sure

00:06:33.831 --> 00:06:35.082
I have much faith in your poker face.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.668
I'm confident

00:06:37.752 --> 00:06:39.170
that I won't get caught.

00:06:39.253 --> 00:06:40.171
Really?

00:06:40.254 --> 00:06:41.172
Most definitely.

00:07:03.986 --> 00:07:05.780
Hello, sir. It's Shin Jung-woo.

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:07.823
It's been a while.

00:07:08.616 --> 00:07:10.034
I was just wondering…

00:07:12.161 --> 00:07:14.247
if you knew
what Hong Keum-bo has been up to.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.553
I'm back.

00:07:30.429 --> 00:07:33.057
Jang-mi, you look extra tired today.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.684
I ran a bit. It's been a while.

00:07:37.937 --> 00:07:39.981
Being young must be so nice.

00:07:41.857 --> 00:07:44.193
Now that everyone's home,
how about a late-night snack?

00:07:44.652 --> 00:07:46.612
How does rotisserie chicken sound?
It'll be my treat.

00:07:46.696 --> 00:07:47.530
Yes!

00:07:47.613 --> 00:07:50.741
But it's almost midnight.
We can't order any deliveries.

00:07:51.659 --> 00:07:52.493
Oh, right.

00:07:52.577 --> 00:07:55.413
The RA made that very clear
at the orientation.

00:07:56.706 --> 00:07:58.249
It does sound really tasty though.

00:08:01.252 --> 00:08:02.378
Hello, sir.

00:08:02.461 --> 00:08:04.088
I'm calling from the women's dorm,
Room 301.

00:08:04.171 --> 00:08:06.382
Can we get two rotisserie chickens?

00:08:06.465 --> 00:08:07.508
Two bottles of beer too.

00:08:08.134 --> 00:08:10.303
Thank you. See you there.

00:08:13.598 --> 00:08:15.725
Do you know what sets
humans apart from animals?

00:08:17.852 --> 00:08:20.354
It's that we humans use tools.

00:08:36.203 --> 00:08:37.705
- Jang-mi.
- Why me?

00:08:37.788 --> 00:08:39.332
Do you expect me to do it then?

00:08:39.415 --> 00:08:41.125
This is clearly a job for the youngest.

00:09:17.745 --> 00:09:18.579
Jang-mi.

00:09:19.205 --> 00:09:21.040
Heave-ho.

00:09:23.209 --> 00:09:24.585
- Heave-ho.
- Heave-ho.

00:09:24.669 --> 00:09:25.795
Stop it.

00:09:27.171 --> 00:09:29.382
- Heave-ho.
- Heave-ho.

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:34.136
Heave-ho.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:35.513
Keep going.

00:09:43.062 --> 00:09:44.397
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:09:53.489 --> 00:09:54.323
Eat up.

00:09:54.407 --> 00:09:55.908
{\an8}JEOM'S ROTISSERIE CHICKEN

00:09:58.452 --> 00:10:02.623
CREDIBILITY

00:10:02.707 --> 00:10:03.541
SUSPICIOUS

00:10:03.624 --> 00:10:04.625
This is so good.

00:10:13.092 --> 00:10:14.260
Here. Take it.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.853
I'm not a kid.
What am I supposed to do with this?

00:10:34.321 --> 00:10:35.656
Hong Jang-mi.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:39.118
As of today, you're officially recognized
as a resident of Room 301.

00:10:39.201 --> 00:10:40.327
"As of today"?

00:10:41.245 --> 00:10:43.038
I've lived here for three days already.

00:10:45.124 --> 00:10:48.043
Come on, I let you have the pink one.

00:10:49.837 --> 00:10:51.005
Thanks.

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:03.309
Who is she to recognize me or whatever?

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.347
What's your deal?
Don't dig through my stuff!

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:42.973
Wait, I'm not…

00:11:43.557 --> 00:11:45.726
- No, hold on.
- Let go, you thief!

00:11:45.809 --> 00:11:47.144
What? Thief?

00:11:49.271 --> 00:11:50.105
- Bok-hee.
- Are you okay?

00:11:50.189 --> 00:11:51.065
Hey!

00:11:51.524 --> 00:11:53.734
You thief!

00:11:55.027 --> 00:11:56.195
Who's that at this hour?

00:12:10.668 --> 00:12:11.794
Bok-hee.

00:12:11.877 --> 00:12:13.337
If she were looking to steal,

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.881
she would've gone for your wallet,
not your notebook.

00:12:19.093 --> 00:12:20.344
Maybe she already did.

00:12:20.427 --> 00:12:22.054
You two, search her pockets.

00:12:23.097 --> 00:12:25.099
Go on and search them. Search away.

00:12:27.059 --> 00:12:28.561
It's your RA. Open the door.

00:12:32.439 --> 00:12:33.440
Put it away.

00:12:50.124 --> 00:12:52.501
I heard you shout earlier, Ms. Go.

00:12:53.002 --> 00:12:55.421
Are you experiencing issues
with your roommates again?

00:12:55.504 --> 00:12:57.381
You are one demerit point away
from eviction.

00:12:59.967 --> 00:13:01.885
We're all great friends here.

00:13:02.845 --> 00:13:04.179
Maybe the TV was too loud?

00:13:04.972 --> 00:13:06.390
We were watching a comedy show.

00:13:06.473 --> 00:13:07.516
Right.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.852
We're really into this series, you see.

00:13:09.935 --> 00:13:11.437
It's past midnight.

00:13:12.021 --> 00:13:13.147
In fact, it's color bars time.

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:19.903
This is the only way.

00:13:23.991 --> 00:13:26.243
Bok-hee's bag fell over,

00:13:26.327 --> 00:13:28.203
so I was just trying to be nice

00:13:28.287 --> 00:13:30.497
and pick up what fell out of it.

00:13:30.998 --> 00:13:34.668
That's when she came in
and treated me like some thief.

00:13:34.752 --> 00:13:35.628
No, I didn't.

00:13:36.211 --> 00:13:39.840
I've always been an honest,
tax-paying citizen.

00:13:41.425 --> 00:13:43.844
Taxes? You haven't even received
your first paycheck yet.

00:13:44.428 --> 00:13:46.889
Ms. Kim, she's lying through her teeth.

00:13:46.972 --> 00:13:48.891
She's a bad seed!

00:13:50.351 --> 00:13:51.518
That's enough.

00:13:52.019 --> 00:13:53.771
Ms. Go, bring me your bag.

00:13:53.854 --> 00:13:54.855
Pardon?

00:14:02.613 --> 00:14:04.073
Do you see anything missing?

00:14:05.741 --> 00:14:06.575
No.

00:14:13.165 --> 00:14:14.124
Any missing money?

00:14:15.459 --> 00:14:16.460
It is all there, but…

00:14:19.797 --> 00:14:20.631
What about this?

00:14:21.382 --> 00:14:24.259
It's a notebook from work,
but I use it as my diary.

00:14:25.594 --> 00:14:28.389
With no financial loss
or missing property,

00:14:29.098 --> 00:14:30.140
it'd be difficult to call this theft.

00:14:30.975 --> 00:14:32.893
It seems there's been
a little misunderstanding.

00:14:33.894 --> 00:14:35.187
Let's just settle this amicably.

00:14:49.326 --> 00:14:52.246
EPISODE 3: RIGHT UNDER THE NOSE
AND IN THE LINE OF FIRE

00:14:53.038 --> 00:14:56.333
{\an8}Chuseok, the nation's biggest holiday,
is fast approaching.

00:14:56.417 --> 00:14:58.627
{\an8}With a four-day holiday this year,

00:14:58.711 --> 00:15:00.921
{\an8}train stations and bus terminals
across the country

00:15:01.005 --> 00:15:04.591
{\an8}are bustling with people heading home
to spend time with their families.

00:15:04.675 --> 00:15:07.011
{\an8}Let's find out more
about the holiday traffic.

00:15:07.594 --> 00:15:11.890
The nation's 20 million people
are once again on the move for Chuseok.

00:15:12.474 --> 00:15:15.269
The highways have come
to resemble massive parking lots

00:15:15.352 --> 00:15:18.188
{\an8}with the gridlocks caused
by the influx of homebound traffic.

00:15:18.772 --> 00:15:21.942
{\an8}The lengthy delays for the past two days
had travelers face six-hour travel time…

00:15:22.026 --> 00:15:24.236
{\an8}JANG-MI'S SMILE (REPEAT)

00:15:24.319 --> 00:15:25.446
{\an8}"Jang-mi"?

00:15:26.947 --> 00:15:28.323
{\an8}Screw that.

00:15:28.407 --> 00:15:30.159
{\an8}Daejeon saw its highways

00:15:30.242 --> 00:15:32.995
{\an8}at a virtual standstill
with the convergence of holiday traffic…

00:15:33.078 --> 00:15:35.706
{\an8}Gather around, Room 301.

00:15:39.626 --> 00:15:40.669
{\an8}Happy Chuseok!

00:15:42.588 --> 00:15:44.173
{\an8}We should celebrate the holiday too.

00:15:45.049 --> 00:15:48.385
{\an8}Living under the same roof
and sharing meals makes us family.

00:15:58.687 --> 00:15:59.688
This is so good.

00:16:01.315 --> 00:16:02.191
Try that too.

00:16:07.488 --> 00:16:08.447
Look at this big chunk.

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:19.333
Seriously?

00:16:21.168 --> 00:16:22.711
Did you really show up empty-handed

00:16:22.795 --> 00:16:24.463
to a table set by your seniors
and expect to feast?

00:16:24.546 --> 00:16:26.173
But you didn't cook anything, either.

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:35.224
The braised short ribs
are really good, Mi-sook.

00:17:04.086 --> 00:17:06.213
Hey, turn that computer off.

00:17:06.296 --> 00:17:08.132
I can't sleep because of you!

00:17:08.215 --> 00:17:10.884
Are you sure it's not
the guilt keeping you awake?

00:17:14.972 --> 00:17:16.598
Did you already forget

00:17:16.682 --> 00:17:18.058
that I helped you keep your job?

00:17:19.017 --> 00:17:20.102
Hey!

00:17:32.781 --> 00:17:35.075
One of us will end up moving out.

00:17:35.159 --> 00:17:35.993
And for your information,

00:17:36.076 --> 00:17:37.035
I'm not moving out.

00:17:38.453 --> 00:17:40.038
I could say just the same.

00:17:44.251 --> 00:17:45.335
Oh my gosh.

00:17:45.961 --> 00:17:47.504
I guess she got kicked out.

00:17:50.174 --> 00:17:51.967
Do you want to sleep in our room?

00:17:53.677 --> 00:17:55.095
I didn't get kicked out.

00:17:55.179 --> 00:17:56.305
I'm fine.

00:18:02.269 --> 00:18:03.604
Please make me rich.

00:18:04.146 --> 00:18:05.731
I want to get married.

00:18:10.611 --> 00:18:13.739
Please let me find Yehppee quickly
so I can return home.

00:18:14.239 --> 00:18:15.073
I beg you.

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:26.210
{\an8}HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

00:18:26.293 --> 00:18:28.212
{\an8}WISHING ALL OF THE HANMIN FAMILY
A BOUNTIFUL CHUSEOK

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:33.175
HANMIN REWARDS WITH FULLY RIPENED RETURNS!

00:18:33.258 --> 00:18:35.302
Come on now.

00:18:35.385 --> 00:18:37.387
Why not? Spicier is better.

00:18:43.227 --> 00:18:45.604
Ms. Hong, is the cafe open today?

00:18:50.108 --> 00:18:50.943
It's so bitter.

00:18:52.069 --> 00:18:53.195
Never heard of two, two, two,
the golden ratio?

00:18:53.278 --> 00:18:55.280
Half your job is making coffee.

00:18:56.114 --> 00:18:59.284
You really should go back to Admin

00:18:59.785 --> 00:19:01.119
and relearn the basics.

00:19:03.455 --> 00:19:04.581
Come here for a second.

00:19:06.375 --> 00:19:07.834
You know Ms. Go in Admin?

00:19:08.377 --> 00:19:10.087
The spinster who's almost 30.

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:11.505
There's a new president in town,

00:19:11.588 --> 00:19:13.590
so how do you think
she managed to survive?

00:19:15.592 --> 00:19:19.054
Life must be so easy for women.

00:19:19.137 --> 00:19:22.140
But don't honey traps
and brute force feel a bit outdated?

00:19:22.224 --> 00:19:23.558
Times have changed. Right?

00:19:26.603 --> 00:19:27.729
General Manager Cha Jung-il.

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:29.982
What? Are you curious too?

00:19:30.774 --> 00:19:31.775
You are, aren't you?

00:19:32.401 --> 00:19:33.402
Shut that mouth of yours.

00:19:34.611 --> 00:19:36.446
Times have changed.

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:38.073
What?

00:19:38.156 --> 00:19:41.868
You should stop spreading nasty rumors
and act your age now.

00:19:41.952 --> 00:19:43.245
Hey!

00:19:43.328 --> 00:19:45.664
Did you hear about Ms. Hong
from Risk Management?

00:19:45.747 --> 00:19:47.624
I heard Cha from Research
has it out for her.

00:19:48.333 --> 00:19:49.167
Yeah.

00:19:49.251 --> 00:19:51.461
But I heard he was the one who started it,

00:19:51.545 --> 00:19:53.797
talking about how the new president
is keeping Go Bok-hee around

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.090
because she set a honey trap.

00:19:55.674 --> 00:19:56.925
Yeah, and after he did,

00:19:57.009 --> 00:19:58.760
Ms. Hong told him to shut up.

00:19:59.761 --> 00:20:02.431
Still, assigning her that translation task
meant for foreign-trained staff

00:20:02.514 --> 00:20:03.849
is taking it too far.

00:20:03.932 --> 00:20:06.852
There's no way a high school grad
could finish that by tomorrow morning.

00:20:07.477 --> 00:20:08.603
I know, right?

00:20:28.457 --> 00:20:30.042
I heard Cha has it out for you again.

00:20:30.125 --> 00:20:31.668
Yes, well…

00:20:31.752 --> 00:20:33.211
I'm sure you'll do obnoxiously well, but…

00:20:33.962 --> 00:20:35.756
You can speak a bit of English, can't you?

00:20:39.259 --> 00:20:40.093
Just a bit.

00:20:41.345 --> 00:20:43.138
I think it'll be faster if I do it myself.

00:20:45.015 --> 00:20:45.974
Jeez.

00:20:53.357 --> 00:20:54.816
Why wait? I told you to go on ahead.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:55.734
{\an8}GLOBAL STOCK MARKET REPORT,
TRANSLATED COPY

00:20:55.817 --> 00:20:56.943
You couldn't help anyway.

00:20:57.027 --> 00:20:58.403
I cheered you on in my heart.

00:20:59.821 --> 00:21:00.655
Let's go.

00:21:01.323 --> 00:21:02.366
Wait.

00:21:19.383 --> 00:21:20.425
LAXATIVE

00:21:27.557 --> 00:21:29.601
NORA'S LAXATIVES
CHA'S VITAMINS

00:21:33.063 --> 00:21:34.773
Don't you think that's a bit childish?

00:21:34.856 --> 00:21:36.566
Revenge is meant to be petty.

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:37.984
That's the way to piss them off.

00:21:39.027 --> 00:21:39.861
Jang-mi.

00:21:40.445 --> 00:21:41.696
You're not going to join in?

00:21:42.447 --> 00:21:43.281
Well…

00:21:51.373 --> 00:21:53.417
RECEIPTS FOR EXPENSE REPORTS

00:21:59.965 --> 00:22:00.799
Are you constipated?

00:22:06.221 --> 00:22:07.264
Good morning.

00:22:07.347 --> 00:22:09.641
- Hello, sir.
- Let's have another good day.

00:22:10.267 --> 00:22:11.101
Hello, sir.

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:21.695
GLOBAL STOCK MARKET REPORT,
TRANSLATED COPY

00:22:31.037 --> 00:22:32.247
To the future. To the world.

00:22:34.249 --> 00:22:35.167
Hanmin.

00:22:37.544 --> 00:22:38.670
MULTIVITAMINS

00:22:44.134 --> 00:22:46.803
This is my first team meeting
since I was hired.

00:22:46.887 --> 00:22:48.638
It's our first one as well.

00:22:48.722 --> 00:22:50.432
This is Risk Management's
first-ever meeting.

00:22:50.515 --> 00:22:53.393
But still, I see you managed
to prepare all this.

00:22:53.476 --> 00:22:54.311
That wasn't me.

00:22:54.394 --> 00:22:55.645
It was me.

00:22:58.064 --> 00:22:59.649
Come on, it's the female employee's job

00:22:59.733 --> 00:23:02.861
to put out the drinks
and snacks for the meeting.

00:23:03.528 --> 00:23:05.363
Noted.

00:23:09.451 --> 00:23:12.037
I need to get this over with
and find Yehppee.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.628
Now, we'll start the meeting

00:23:19.711 --> 00:23:22.589
on Hanmin's information-sharing
system development.

00:23:22.672 --> 00:23:24.341
Let us begin.

00:23:29.262 --> 00:23:32.224
We're not alone in pursuing
an internal information-sharing system.

00:23:32.307 --> 00:23:35.936
Since last year, many companies
have begun implementing such systems.

00:23:36.019 --> 00:23:37.604
These internal workspaces

00:23:37.687 --> 00:23:40.315
for communication and collaboration
are collectively referred to as

00:23:40.398 --> 00:23:41.733
the intranet system.

00:23:43.693 --> 00:23:44.861
The Risk Management Division?

00:23:44.945 --> 00:23:46.196
They can't get anything done.

00:23:46.279 --> 00:23:47.822
They have no brainpower

00:23:47.906 --> 00:23:49.157
or manpower.

00:23:49.241 --> 00:23:50.450
We need to outsource.

00:23:50.533 --> 00:23:51.409
They…

00:23:51.493 --> 00:23:54.287
First, we must develop a system
that can be easily used by all,

00:23:54.371 --> 00:23:56.206
even without a manual.

00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:58.667
If you look at the second factor,

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:01.169
- we need a system based on rank…
- Are they actually working?

00:24:15.517 --> 00:24:18.728
I will do my best to build
an information-sharing system

00:24:18.812 --> 00:24:21.439
that faithfully implements
all the elements I've discussed today.

00:24:22.774 --> 00:24:23.608
Thank you.

00:24:26.319 --> 00:24:29.030
But the most important part,
the development timeline, is missing.

00:24:29.114 --> 00:24:31.366
No need to rush it. We'll just…

00:24:31.449 --> 00:24:32.617
Three days.

00:24:34.452 --> 00:24:36.204
Come on now. Is that even possible?

00:24:37.455 --> 00:24:39.374
Possibility isn't a factor. We must do it.

00:24:44.421 --> 00:24:46.214
It's a directive from the president.

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:49.676
And Mr. Lee is very talented.

00:25:08.695 --> 00:25:10.905
Ms. Hong, you don't know
what you're talking about.

00:25:10.989 --> 00:25:14.451
Even industry professionals
couldn't complete it in three days.

00:25:14.534 --> 00:25:15.702
I will make it happen!

00:25:24.919 --> 00:25:26.087
Good luck! You got this!

00:25:27.255 --> 00:25:28.631
I knew it.

00:25:28.715 --> 00:25:29.549
Let's go!

00:25:30.717 --> 00:25:32.594
Great. Good luck.

00:25:34.054 --> 00:25:35.597
INFORMATION-SHARING SYSTEM
DEVELOPMENT DAY 1

00:25:41.186 --> 00:25:43.480
You're so much faster than I expected.

00:25:44.397 --> 00:25:45.273
Thanks.

00:25:46.316 --> 00:25:48.443
But you made a coding error.

00:25:50.528 --> 00:25:51.363
Here.

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:55.742
Sorry. That was a typing error.

00:25:55.825 --> 00:25:56.659
Mr. Lee.

00:25:57.494 --> 00:25:59.079
You're doing great.

00:26:06.169 --> 00:26:08.296
She's a pro
at the carrot-and-stick approach.

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:11.049
I can't tell who's the manager
and who's the new hire anymore.

00:26:11.591 --> 00:26:14.052
Ms. Hong, do you even know
what you're talking about?

00:26:14.761 --> 00:26:15.970
This is the moment

00:26:16.888 --> 00:26:17.889
I use my secret weapon.

00:26:18.973 --> 00:26:19.891
Oh my.

00:26:20.683 --> 00:26:22.060
My hair is just so in the way.

00:26:36.408 --> 00:26:37.325
I missed it.

00:26:37.409 --> 00:26:40.078
It's so far back.
You're going to rewind it that much?

00:26:41.079 --> 00:26:42.622
INFORMATION-SHARING SYSTEM
DEVELOPMENT DAY 2

00:26:44.916 --> 00:26:46.292
Lunch time.

00:26:46.376 --> 00:26:48.503
How about spicy pork stir-fry?

00:26:49.295 --> 00:26:50.839
Mr. Lee, let's resume after…

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.426
Did you not go home last night?
Could your hair be any greasier?

00:26:54.509 --> 00:26:57.387
No. This is my 29th hour in the office.

00:26:57.470 --> 00:27:00.056
Mr. Lee, you need to eat.
Let's go get some lunch.

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:03.893
I have Mr. Lee's lunch right here.

00:27:11.151 --> 00:27:13.319
She's going to bring him
a chamber pot at this rate.

00:27:14.904 --> 00:27:15.905
Do you need one?

00:27:17.198 --> 00:27:18.616
I'm okay for now.

00:27:20.076 --> 00:27:21.453
Eat up.

00:27:22.662 --> 00:27:23.496
Let's go, Big Al.

00:27:24.622 --> 00:27:26.249
- What should we eat?
- Spicy pork stir-fry!

00:27:31.838 --> 00:27:33.381
INFORMATION-SHARING SYSTEM
DEVELOPMENT DAY 3

00:27:33.465 --> 00:27:35.300
{\an8}MISS BEER

00:28:00.533 --> 00:28:01.367
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

00:28:02.535 --> 00:28:03.661
It's done!

00:28:07.207 --> 00:28:08.374
Is it all done?

00:28:12.003 --> 00:28:13.004
Team dinner time.

00:28:13.087 --> 00:28:14.464
We did it!

00:28:15.381 --> 00:28:17.175
No, we didn't do it.

00:28:17.967 --> 00:28:19.594
Manager Lee Yong-gi did it.

00:28:21.221 --> 00:28:23.139
You gave us
the most excellent performance.

00:28:23.223 --> 00:28:25.016
Well done.

00:28:25.099 --> 00:28:26.768
I'm so proud of you!

00:28:28.061 --> 00:28:29.229
Thank you.

00:28:29.312 --> 00:28:32.690
It was only possible
because of you, Ms. Hong.

00:28:33.274 --> 00:28:34.108
Thank you.

00:28:38.488 --> 00:28:40.490
Thank you.

00:28:41.324 --> 00:28:42.158
Thank you.

00:28:42.242 --> 00:28:44.828
INTRANET PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

00:28:54.838 --> 00:28:57.382
{\an8}PRESIDENT SHIN JUNG-WOO

00:28:57.465 --> 00:28:58.967
{\an8}You finished sooner than I expected.

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:02.637
I'm sure you're already aware,
but I didn't build it.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.056
Ms. Hong Jang-mi and Manager Lee Yong-gi

00:29:05.139 --> 00:29:07.225
gave it everything they had
to make it into a reality.

00:29:07.308 --> 00:29:09.227
Hong Jang-mi and Lee Yong-gi…

00:29:12.564 --> 00:29:15.942
It's a leader's job to enable employees
to stay focused on their work.

00:29:16.609 --> 00:29:20.363
Chairman Kang asked me
to provide you with guidance

00:29:20.446 --> 00:29:23.324
to ensure that you develop
into a leader befitting Hanmin.

00:29:24.242 --> 00:29:25.076
Me?

00:29:26.744 --> 00:29:27.745
Why?

00:29:30.331 --> 00:29:34.377
So you'll basically be taking on
the role of Mr. So.

00:29:36.462 --> 00:29:38.840
He started tutoring my uncle
on the stock market

00:29:38.923 --> 00:29:40.675
when my uncle was a college student.

00:29:41.259 --> 00:29:43.678
After my uncle joined the company,
he served as…

00:29:44.804 --> 00:29:45.889
a loyal aide.

00:29:46.639 --> 00:29:47.473
A "loyal aide"?

00:29:48.099 --> 00:29:49.017
Yes.

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.315
But you know

00:29:56.733 --> 00:29:58.443
that our chairman
also has a daughter, right?

00:30:01.571 --> 00:30:02.906
Feel free to play both sides.

00:30:14.042 --> 00:30:15.460
INTRANET SYSTEM ANNOUNCEMENT

00:30:15.543 --> 00:30:16.920
ALL INTERNAL MATERIALS WILL BE SHARED
VIA THE "INTRANET."

00:30:17.503 --> 00:30:20.423
{\an8}INTRANET SYSTEM
PLEASE LOG IN TO ACCESS

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.054
They're only making life difficult
with this nonsense.

00:30:26.137 --> 00:30:27.722
This would only be a challenge
for the general managers.

00:30:27.805 --> 00:30:28.848
Youngsters learn fast.

00:30:29.974 --> 00:30:31.142
I'm young.

00:30:32.018 --> 00:30:32.936
I'm in my prime.

00:30:35.146 --> 00:30:36.648
The intranet makes it so much easier.

00:30:37.148 --> 00:30:39.400
We're making
half the copies and deliveries.

00:30:39.984 --> 00:30:42.779
I know, right?
I heard they worked three nights straight.

00:30:42.862 --> 00:30:43.738
Seriously?

00:30:50.286 --> 00:30:53.748
Didn't you say you'd eat your hat
if Jang-mi got it done?

00:30:55.083 --> 00:30:56.376
When did I say that?

00:30:56.459 --> 00:30:58.586
And it's not like
Hong Jang-mi did it herself.

00:31:01.172 --> 00:31:02.131
The intranet.

00:31:02.215 --> 00:31:05.343
That's right. Albert, my son, made it.

00:31:05.426 --> 00:31:07.178
It makes life easier. It's nice.

00:31:08.763 --> 00:31:10.473
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, sir.

00:31:22.276 --> 00:31:23.987
That's not like you at all.

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:31.953
We were hearing feedback
on the new intranet system.

00:31:32.453 --> 00:31:35.540
Everyone gave five stars.
They are all very satisfied with it.

00:31:35.623 --> 00:31:36.541
Is that so?

00:31:37.542 --> 00:31:39.877
President Shin, what are your thoughts?

00:31:39.961 --> 00:31:41.963
It has an intuitive design
that maximizes usability.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.133
Division Manager Oh
graciously credited his team.

00:31:45.216 --> 00:31:46.342
Really?

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:48.261
Our Albert is

00:31:48.344 --> 00:31:51.055
just so humble, isn't he, sir?

00:31:51.597 --> 00:31:55.143
I told him to take it easy,
but he does his name proud.

00:31:55.226 --> 00:31:56.436
"Noble and bright."

00:31:56.519 --> 00:31:58.646
He nobly thinks about
the company's bright future.

00:32:01.858 --> 00:32:03.234
All right, everyone.

00:32:03.317 --> 00:32:05.111
Our job is done for the year.

00:32:05.194 --> 00:32:07.321
Don't do any work until next year.
That's all!

00:32:07.405 --> 00:32:09.198
Yeah! No more work!

00:32:20.209 --> 00:32:21.461
PERSONAL DETAILS
GO BOK-HEE

00:32:21.544 --> 00:32:23.129
Maybe I should try Go Bok-hee again.

00:32:24.255 --> 00:32:26.674
No, let's move on to
So Gyeong-dong straight away.

00:32:28.718 --> 00:32:32.180
PERSONAL DETAILS
SO GYEONG-DONG

00:32:35.641 --> 00:32:36.642
NOTES: DOG LOVER

00:32:38.811 --> 00:32:41.689
Maybe Yehppee is the name of his dog?

00:32:53.201 --> 00:32:54.035
Let's see…

00:33:07.799 --> 00:33:10.218
Oh my, I'm so honored.

00:33:10.301 --> 00:33:11.260
Mr. Lee.

00:33:11.803 --> 00:33:14.806
Do you happen to know
the name of Mr. So's dog?

00:33:14.889 --> 00:33:15.890
So pretty…

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:17.767
I mean, Yehppee.

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:19.811
Yehppee?

00:33:19.894 --> 00:33:21.521
Are you sure it's Yehppee?

00:33:22.105 --> 00:33:25.691
Of course. I heard about it
while drinking with So-Bang-Cha.

00:33:26.192 --> 00:33:27.527
"So-Bang-Cha"?

00:33:42.125 --> 00:33:43.543
Why don't you

00:33:43.626 --> 00:33:44.544
Know

00:33:44.627 --> 00:33:45.878
How I feel about you?

00:33:48.256 --> 00:33:51.050
They all differ in age,
year of hire, and rank, but they're close.

00:33:51.134 --> 00:33:52.760
That's why they got that nickname.

00:33:54.512 --> 00:33:57.014
You could even call them
the living witnesses

00:33:57.098 --> 00:33:58.307
to every rise and fall of Hanmin.

00:33:59.976 --> 00:34:02.270
I heard the late president

00:34:02.353 --> 00:34:06.023
really trusted
all three members of So-Bang-Cha.

00:34:06.607 --> 00:34:08.151
That's right. It seemed like that.

00:34:09.318 --> 00:34:11.195
Who did he trust the most?

00:34:13.614 --> 00:34:14.448
Jeong Won-gwan.

00:34:15.783 --> 00:34:16.742
I mean, Mr. So.

00:34:18.494 --> 00:34:19.412
I see.

00:34:23.166 --> 00:34:24.375
Hello, sir.

00:34:24.959 --> 00:34:27.295
- Hello there.
- He's our new hire.

00:34:27.378 --> 00:34:28.713
So Gyeong-dong.

00:34:28.796 --> 00:34:31.215
The legendary trader of Yeouido.

00:34:31.799 --> 00:34:34.427
In the securities market,
where returns are a measure of character,

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:38.306
he's admired not only for his talent
but also for his integrity.

00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:42.560
He's a Hanmin man to the core,
turning down any and every job offer

00:34:42.643 --> 00:34:44.228
that came his way all these years.

00:34:46.063 --> 00:34:48.482
- They hired a lot this year.
- Yeah.

00:34:50.067 --> 00:34:51.235
What would you like?

00:34:51.319 --> 00:34:53.779
- Kimchi pork stir-fry for me.
- Kimchi pork stir-fry?

00:34:57.742 --> 00:34:59.660
Yes, understood.

00:35:03.122 --> 00:35:05.708
Hello, this is from Mr. Cha.

00:35:05.791 --> 00:35:06.626
Thank you.

00:35:06.709 --> 00:35:08.461
- Hurry.
- A copy?

00:35:08.544 --> 00:35:09.378
Yes, hurry.

00:35:09.462 --> 00:35:10.755
And Ms. Kang, bring more coffee.

00:35:11.589 --> 00:35:13.466
- Yes, sir.
- Get me a refill.

00:35:15.259 --> 00:35:16.093
Sorry.

00:35:17.345 --> 00:35:18.304
My apologies.

00:35:18.387 --> 00:35:19.472
Get it together.

00:35:25.144 --> 00:35:27.647
- What would you like?
- I already told you the second one.

00:35:28.731 --> 00:35:29.607
Quickly.

00:35:38.532 --> 00:35:39.408
Oh no.

00:35:39.492 --> 00:35:41.369
Please don't fall.

00:35:46.415 --> 00:35:47.416
Darn it.

00:35:52.546 --> 00:35:53.631
Thank you so much.

00:35:56.217 --> 00:35:58.594
We should help each other out, Eun-joo.

00:36:07.019 --> 00:36:08.562
It's just so hard.

00:36:09.105 --> 00:36:10.481
Since I'm the youngest,

00:36:10.564 --> 00:36:12.942
I have to grab lunch
for all 20 traders by myself.

00:36:14.652 --> 00:36:16.904
They yell at me
for getting their orders wrong,

00:36:16.988 --> 00:36:18.489
for being so slow,

00:36:19.073 --> 00:36:20.658
and for delivery mistakes.

00:36:22.576 --> 00:36:24.662
But you know what's even more annoying?

00:36:25.496 --> 00:36:27.206
Even after stomaching all that criticism,

00:36:27.707 --> 00:36:29.792
I'm still hungry for food.

00:36:32.211 --> 00:36:33.796
Eat up, Eun-joo.

00:36:36.882 --> 00:36:38.050
It's so tasty.

00:36:40.636 --> 00:36:43.139
By the way, how is Mr. So Gyeong-dong?

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:44.974
My boss?

00:36:46.058 --> 00:36:47.810
He doesn't eat lunch.

00:36:48.436 --> 00:36:49.937
Apparently, he's been like that
for 20 years.

00:36:50.021 --> 00:36:51.105
Nine to six.

00:36:51.188 --> 00:36:54.650
He only ever leaves his desk
to go to the bathroom.

00:36:57.194 --> 00:36:59.780
But still, he never yells at me.

00:37:03.367 --> 00:37:05.953
Starting tomorrow, how about I help you

00:37:06.037 --> 00:37:07.872
since my team isn't busy at all?

00:37:13.627 --> 00:37:14.503
Let me wipe that for you.

00:37:23.012 --> 00:37:24.138
RISK MANAGEMENT DIVISION

00:37:35.649 --> 00:37:36.525
Good morning.

00:37:38.819 --> 00:37:39.653
What's that?

00:37:40.237 --> 00:37:41.072
Is it a gift?

00:37:41.989 --> 00:37:43.366
- For Ms. Hong?
- Yes.

00:37:43.449 --> 00:37:45.326
To thank her for her guidance and support.

00:37:45.409 --> 00:37:48.537
I bought some handmade cookies
that would go perfectly with coffee.

00:37:48.621 --> 00:37:49.830
What about for us?

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:52.958
Neither of you contributed anything.

00:37:53.042 --> 00:37:55.044
I also know
how to nitpick and micromanage,

00:37:55.127 --> 00:37:56.670
but I held back.

00:37:56.754 --> 00:37:57.922
Hold on.

00:37:59.006 --> 00:38:02.510
What's with the sudden perm
and highlights?

00:38:03.427 --> 00:38:04.303
Highlights?

00:38:05.304 --> 00:38:06.430
You got highlights?

00:38:06.514 --> 00:38:10.017
I'm going to need to have
a conversation with Ms. Hong.

00:38:10.101 --> 00:38:11.227
- About what?
- Why?

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:13.562
About how office romances ruin lives.

00:38:14.063 --> 00:38:15.689
- That's not what this is.
- It clearly is.

00:38:15.773 --> 00:38:17.108
- That's a misunderstanding.
- I don't think so.

00:38:17.608 --> 00:38:19.360
No, you can't… Darn it.

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:23.948
Hold on. Where's Ms. Hong anyway?

00:38:24.573 --> 00:38:25.449
Did she call out?

00:38:26.742 --> 00:38:29.286
You're not supposed to touch this.
Damn it.

00:38:30.246 --> 00:38:31.831
What would you like for lunch?

00:38:31.914 --> 00:38:33.416
Would you like Kimchi pork stir-fry again?

00:38:33.499 --> 00:38:34.458
Yeah, let's go with that.

00:38:40.172 --> 00:38:42.633
Now, shall we get started
on another exciting day?

00:38:45.469 --> 00:38:47.763
Let's once again survive today.

00:38:47.847 --> 00:38:49.682
Let's survive as long as we can.

00:38:50.182 --> 00:38:51.392
Beyond the Han River.

00:38:51.475 --> 00:38:53.227
- To the World! To the Future!
- To the World! To the Future!

00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:54.353
- Hanmin!
- Hanmin.

00:39:11.287 --> 00:39:13.164
Would you like to place your lunch order?

00:39:13.247 --> 00:39:14.206
Just the usual for me.

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:17.084
Sure.

00:39:28.304 --> 00:39:29.930
HANYE ELECTRONICS 11:27

00:39:45.446 --> 00:39:46.655
{\an8}YEHPPEE?

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:04.757
Big Al, let's grab
pork bone soup for lunch.

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:07.551
That sounds great,

00:40:08.552 --> 00:40:10.221
- but I have plans.
- With who?

00:40:10.304 --> 00:40:13.849
With the chairman, my dad,
and Mr. So from Trading.

00:40:13.933 --> 00:40:14.767
Really?

00:40:15.392 --> 00:40:17.478
Ms. Hong, join us for lunch.

00:40:17.937 --> 00:40:20.689
I have to help Trading
with the lunch deliveries.

00:40:22.816 --> 00:40:23.734
Enjoy your lunch.

00:40:23.817 --> 00:40:25.945
You'll look even more haggard
if you skip meals.

00:40:26.028 --> 00:40:26.862
Let's go eat lunch.

00:40:26.946 --> 00:40:28.531
I'll see you later.

00:40:36.121 --> 00:40:39.625
I jumped through hoops to get them
from a key shop down in Cheonggyecheon.

00:40:39.708 --> 00:40:42.461
They can open pretty much
all locked drawers and filing cabinets.

00:40:44.088 --> 00:40:45.506
These are the master keys.

00:40:52.096 --> 00:40:53.556
{\an8}TEN MINUTES TO THE MORNING SESSION CLOSE

00:40:54.932 --> 00:40:56.642
- Enjoy your lunch.
- Thanks.

00:40:58.143 --> 00:40:59.979
Ms. Kang, no cucumbers in mine, right?

00:41:00.854 --> 00:41:02.773
- You said anything, so…
- Are there cucumbers?

00:41:03.524 --> 00:41:04.358
Are you kidding me?

00:41:10.155 --> 00:41:11.907
GENERAL MANAGER SO GYEONG-DONG

00:41:16.912 --> 00:41:20.165
Dump all your Hanye Electronics shares
at the limit down.

00:41:20.791 --> 00:41:23.335
Once you sweep the order book,
we'll step in and clean it up.

00:41:24.128 --> 00:41:26.672
Just make sure
we get a clean start at 11:27.

Hey.

00:42:00.331 --> 00:42:01.457
Where's my lunch?

00:42:04.209 --> 00:42:05.210
Jang-mi.

00:42:06.003 --> 00:42:06.879
What are you doing?

00:42:22.436 --> 00:42:23.604
I need coffee.

00:42:23.687 --> 00:42:24.563
Coming.

00:42:29.068 --> 00:42:30.903
I'll be right back.

00:42:49.838 --> 00:42:50.673
{\an8}Are you crazy?

00:42:50.756 --> 00:42:51.924
{\an8}What's wrong with you?

00:42:52.925 --> 00:42:53.926

How much are you dumping at limit down?

00:43:05.187 --> 00:43:06.647
CORRECT/CANCEL

00:43:09.274 --> 00:43:10.401
Is this Korea Exchange?

00:43:10.484 --> 00:43:14.071
Please cancel the 11:27 order
for Hanye Electronics from Hanmin.

00:43:15.906 --> 00:43:17.074
Ms. Hong from Risk Management?

00:43:17.157 --> 00:43:20.202
There's no way she was smart enough
to prevent an order-entry blunder.

00:43:20.285 --> 00:43:21.245
She's just a new hire,

00:43:21.787 --> 00:43:23.038
a minion,

00:43:23.622 --> 00:43:24.456
a high-school grad.

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:25.833
What does she know?

00:43:25.916 --> 00:43:28.502
So who's the trader
behind the three-billion-won screw-up?

00:43:28.585 --> 00:43:29.628
Who knows?

00:43:29.712 --> 00:43:33.298
That idiot can forget about
ever working in Yeouido again.

00:43:34.049 --> 00:43:36.385
But that Ms. Hong…

00:43:37.594 --> 00:43:39.638
I feel like I've seen her
somewhere before.

00:43:40.389 --> 00:43:41.390
The interview, remember?

00:43:41.473 --> 00:43:44.226
She's the cheeky one who raised her hand
because we didn't ask her anything.

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:47.396
She was the one who pointed out
the exam question error?

00:43:50.816 --> 00:43:52.025
That little one

00:43:52.901 --> 00:43:54.611
likes to nitpick as if it were a hobby.

00:43:55.612 --> 00:43:57.948
I'm actually worried about Mr. So.

00:43:59.783 --> 00:44:01.660
This is complete nonsense!

00:44:02.286 --> 00:44:06.123
He claims he made the order-entry error

00:44:06.206 --> 00:44:08.167
due to a keyboard malfunction.

00:44:10.043 --> 00:44:11.295
It didn't seem intentional…

00:44:11.378 --> 00:44:13.297
Unbelievable.

00:44:14.006 --> 00:44:16.842
Are you trying to cover
for your subordinate right now?

00:44:17.384 --> 00:44:19.887
I guess one more slip
and the whole company will go under.

00:44:21.764 --> 00:44:25.017
We're discussing executed trades
with the relevant brokerages.

00:44:25.517 --> 00:44:28.812
But still, the error was detected,
and the order was canceled immediately.

00:44:28.896 --> 00:44:30.939
We requested the Korea Exchange
to cancel the order,

00:44:31.023 --> 00:44:32.691
which helped prevent additional losses.

00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:38.197
I heard some lowly female employee
was the one who canceled it.

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.449
Who cares about that right now?

00:44:41.074 --> 00:44:44.286
I was just worried about her going around,
spreading her "heroic" tale

00:44:44.369 --> 00:44:45.954
and damaging the company's image.

00:44:46.455 --> 00:44:48.207
I'm just concerned, that's all.

00:44:48.957 --> 00:44:50.083
More importantly,

00:44:50.709 --> 00:44:54.129
I've received a tip
that this incident has the FSS considering

00:44:54.213 --> 00:44:55.422
an investigation into us.

00:44:55.506 --> 00:44:57.674
What? Goddamnit!

00:45:01.386 --> 00:45:05.015
Is it true that a female employee
from Trading canceled the order?

00:45:05.098 --> 00:45:06.141
No.

00:45:07.309 --> 00:45:09.186
It's the new hire in Risk Management.

00:45:09.811 --> 00:45:12.606
Do you mean Ms. Hong Jang-mi?

00:45:20.989 --> 00:45:22.324
- Hey, you!
- Jeez.

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:28.372
Thanks to you,
I've had the worst indigestion recently.

00:45:28.455 --> 00:45:30.874
Listen, blending in is barely enough
to get you by right now.

00:45:30.958 --> 00:45:33.502
How can you go and attract
even more attention?

00:45:33.585 --> 00:45:37.005
Who cares if Hanmin makes an order error
and loses three billion won?

00:45:37.089 --> 00:45:38.298
That's none of your business.

00:45:38.382 --> 00:45:41.343
Look, my hand reacted
before I could think.

00:45:41.426 --> 00:45:43.804
You're so painfully predictable.

00:45:43.887 --> 00:45:47.933
I have to carry around antacids
because of you.

00:45:49.184 --> 00:45:51.687
Wait, how did you find out?

00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:52.938
Who told you?

00:45:53.021 --> 00:45:54.731
"Three billion won"?
That's quite detailed.

00:45:56.525 --> 00:45:57.985
If only no one else knew.

00:45:58.569 --> 00:46:01.572
Word has spread from Yeouido
all the way to Euljiro.

00:46:03.115 --> 00:46:04.199
Was it on the news?

00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:07.327
The news? As if.

00:46:10.622 --> 00:46:11.707
The Yeouido Pirates.

00:46:12.958 --> 00:46:15.210

{\an8}ANOTHER HISTORIC INCIDENT IN THE
SILENT BATTLEFIELD OF THE STOCK MARKET!

00:46:40.152 --> 00:46:41.320
Breaking news.

00:46:41.403 --> 00:46:44.948
A 20-year-old high school graduate
employee saved Hanmin?

00:46:45.032 --> 00:46:46.908
"A 20-year-old high school graduate…"

00:46:49.077 --> 00:46:50.829
It can't be, can it?

00:46:51.705 --> 00:46:54.374
Around 11:30 today,
Hanmin's Trading Division

00:46:54.458 --> 00:46:57.210
witnessed an order-entry error
of the century.

00:46:57.294 --> 00:47:00.881
It was an error that could've cost
the company three billion won.

00:47:00.964 --> 00:47:05.344
{\an8}The kicker in this story is
the unexpected heroine who saved the day.

00:47:05.427 --> 00:47:06.261

The heroine sensed danger in the air
and threw herself

00:47:58.021 --> 00:47:59.773
to rectify the situation.

00:48:06.113 --> 00:48:08.657
She was neither a high-paid trader

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:10.742
nor a foreign-trained analyst,

00:48:11.702 --> 00:48:14.371
but a lowly entry-level employee
with a high school diploma.

00:48:14.454 --> 00:48:16.248
Her name was Hong Jang-mi.

BREAKING NEWS: 20-YEAR-OLD FEMALE
HIGH SCHOOL GRAD EMPLOYEE SAVED HANMIN!

00:48:24.631 --> 00:48:27.592
The Yeouido stock market
is where you make your living.

00:48:27.676 --> 00:48:29.553
How can you not know
about the Yeouido Pirates?

00:48:31.138 --> 00:48:33.014
From stock-market rumors

00:48:33.682 --> 00:48:37.561
and backroom gossip at hostess bars
to top-tier corporate intel.

00:48:37.644 --> 00:48:41.106
All those come from the Yeouido Pirates,
the PC Communication site.

00:48:42.023 --> 00:48:45.152
The moderator
calls themselves the Captain,

00:48:45.902 --> 00:48:47.821
but nobody knows who they are.

00:48:48.572 --> 00:48:50.949
Some say they're
a retail investor from Myeongdong,

00:48:51.032 --> 00:48:54.578
while others say
they're a retired politician or a hacker.

00:48:54.661 --> 00:48:56.121
The rumor mill churns them out.

00:48:57.289 --> 00:49:01.334
But you know,
based on the caliber of their intel,

00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:04.087
they're clearly
a hotshot in this industry.

00:49:04.838 --> 00:49:06.840
The Captain of the Yeouido Pirates?

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:08.508
I've never heard of them.

00:49:09.384 --> 00:49:12.512
Wait, how do you know about this
when I just heard about it?

00:49:14.681 --> 00:49:17.476
Do you think I got this far
just on my card-playing skills?

00:49:17.559 --> 00:49:19.853
You always push your luck
and suffer alone in the end.

00:49:20.937 --> 00:49:23.398
I received my invite and joined ages ago.

00:49:23.482 --> 00:49:24.441
The Yeouido Pirates, that is.

00:49:26.234 --> 00:49:30.655
I still manage to maintain
good relationships with people,

00:49:31.239 --> 00:49:32.324
unlike you.

00:49:34.075 --> 00:49:35.118
Right.

00:49:35.744 --> 00:49:38.622
So I have neither friends nor colleagues.

00:49:38.705 --> 00:49:40.123
That's what you're saying, right?

00:49:42.334 --> 00:49:44.544
I didn't need this gossip rag
to be good at my job.

00:49:44.628 --> 00:49:48.048
Besides, we shouldn't be letting
such baseless rumors dictate our actions.

00:49:49.841 --> 00:49:51.802
Still, I guess we should check it out.

00:49:52.886 --> 00:49:54.012
Send me an invite.

00:49:55.889 --> 00:49:57.474
- I can't.
- Why not?

00:49:57.557 --> 00:49:59.392
You get one invite per account.

00:49:59.976 --> 00:50:01.478
Then you can just invite me.

00:50:02.771 --> 00:50:05.607
I've already sent mine to Nam Dong-gi.

00:50:06.858 --> 00:50:07.901
You chose that jerk over me?

00:50:09.486 --> 00:50:11.738
Why did it have to be
Nam Dong-gi, of all people?

00:50:11.822 --> 00:50:12.781
Damn weasel.

00:50:12.864 --> 00:50:13.907
My stomach is upset again.

00:50:20.330 --> 00:50:21.164
Jang-mi.

00:50:22.457 --> 00:50:23.750
Long day at work?

00:50:24.584 --> 00:50:26.837
Mi-sook, have you heard of
the Yeouido Pirates?

00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:29.506
Yes. I signed up recently.

00:50:30.257 --> 00:50:32.592
Then can you send me an invite?
Recommend me.

00:50:32.676 --> 00:50:36.304
Oh, I already used mine
on my branch section chief today.

00:50:37.222 --> 00:50:38.056
I see.

00:50:41.726 --> 00:50:45.355
I heard that Queen Bee
hasn't used her invite yet.

00:50:46.398 --> 00:50:47.816
Let me give you some advice.

00:50:51.611 --> 00:50:52.612
…and just bring her that.

00:51:15.677 --> 00:51:17.053
The scale of this slush fund is…

00:51:18.263 --> 00:51:20.098
I guess that's the head office for you.

00:51:20.599 --> 00:51:23.560
This job might be too big
for me to handle alone.

00:51:24.436 --> 00:51:26.187
I'm back.

00:51:26.771 --> 00:51:28.523
What's that in your hand? Cake?

00:51:29.524 --> 00:51:31.026
That looks so tasty.

00:51:31.109 --> 00:51:32.861
Bok-hee, you like cake too, don't you?

00:51:34.154 --> 00:51:35.697
It's too late for cake.

00:51:36.281 --> 00:51:37.699
I started my diet yesterday.

00:51:38.992 --> 00:51:41.369
Do you know
how many calories are in a cake?

00:51:46.833 --> 00:51:47.751
Bok-hee.

00:51:47.834 --> 00:51:50.003
Is there any chance you'd invite me
to the Yeouido Pirates?

00:51:50.837 --> 00:51:52.047
I already used up my invite.

00:51:59.471 --> 00:52:00.513
Let me get this straight.

00:52:01.264 --> 00:52:02.933
You all did it for one another

00:52:04.059 --> 00:52:05.060
and just left me out?

00:52:13.568 --> 00:52:14.486
Enjoy the cake.

00:52:27.082 --> 00:52:28.708
Oh no. I already used mine up.

00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:30.085
What about you, Mr. Bang?

00:52:30.835 --> 00:52:32.462
I invited him.

00:52:32.545 --> 00:52:34.089
Big Al, let's go to lunch.

00:52:34.673 --> 00:52:35.507
To Auntie's?

00:52:36.007 --> 00:52:37.008
Let's go to Auntie's, Mr. Lee.

00:52:37.092 --> 00:52:38.510
- Shall we?
- Yeah, let's go eat their soup.

00:52:38.593 --> 00:52:39.719
That sounds great.

00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:42.430
Time for lunch.

00:52:43.974 --> 00:52:45.016
Why didn't you ask me?

00:52:46.851 --> 00:52:48.687
- Pardon?
- For an invite to the Yeouido Pirates.

00:52:49.354 --> 00:52:50.271
I can do that for you.

00:52:55.276 --> 00:52:56.111
Really?

00:53:00.949 --> 00:53:02.784
- Do you mean it?
- Yes.

00:53:09.374 --> 00:53:10.291
Go on then.

00:53:11.251 --> 00:53:12.127
Sure.

00:53:14.129 --> 00:53:17.090
To start, what's your
PC Communication username?

00:53:17.173 --> 00:53:18.299
My PC Communication username?

00:53:19.592 --> 00:53:20.677
Do you not have one?

00:53:21.469 --> 00:53:22.303
Okay then.

00:53:22.887 --> 00:53:24.180
Give me your resident registration number.

00:53:24.264 --> 00:53:25.098
Six…

00:53:27.559 --> 00:53:28.393
Ms. Hong?

00:53:29.227 --> 00:53:30.061
What's the number?

00:53:31.563 --> 00:53:32.981
Well…

00:53:33.857 --> 00:53:35.984
I'll tell you
after you get back from lunch.

00:53:36.067 --> 00:53:36.901
No, I'm fine.

00:53:36.985 --> 00:53:40.113
Gosh, I shouldn't have
asked you during lunchtime.

00:53:40.697 --> 00:53:41.990
You're going to Auntie's, right?

00:53:42.073 --> 00:53:43.158
I'm really fine.

00:53:43.241 --> 00:53:45.160
- You must be starving. Go and eat.
- Wait…

00:53:45.243 --> 00:53:46.453
I'm not hungry anymore.

00:53:46.536 --> 00:53:47.412
Go on.

00:53:51.166 --> 00:53:52.792
HONG JANG-MI

00:53:52.876 --> 00:53:54.794
780511.

00:53:56.463 --> 00:53:58.173
780511…

00:54:13.688 --> 00:54:15.607
YEOUIDO PIRATES
REGISTRATION

00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:16.858
{\an8}YOU ARE NOW A YEOUIDO PIRATES MEMBER

00:54:16.941 --> 00:54:17.776
DISCUSSION BOARD

00:54:18.777 --> 00:54:19.986
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

00:54:20.070 --> 00:54:20.904
SEARCHING…

00:54:22.072 --> 00:54:23.615
HANMIN BLUNDER

00:54:23.698 --> 00:54:24.783
TRADING AT HANMIN SUCKS

00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:30.455
- That character dies eventually.
- Hey.

00:54:32.207 --> 00:54:34.709
- That's how the character dies.
- He dies like that?

00:55:02.779 --> 00:55:03.822
{\an8}HONG KEUM-BO

00:55:04.489 --> 00:55:05.990
SEARCHING…

00:55:09.285 --> 00:55:10.578
"HONG KEUM-BO" SEARCH RESULTS

00:55:10.662 --> 00:55:12.789
THE FAMOUS HONG KEUM-BO,
I DON'T LIKE THE WITCH OF YEOUIDO

00:55:12.872 --> 00:55:15.041
{\an8}HONG WAS AT MY COMPANY,
ANY SEOUN UNIVERSITY ALUMS HERE?

00:55:16.042 --> 00:55:17.877
Look at them all talk trash
behind my back.

00:55:19.212 --> 00:55:20.797
Who made this anyway?

00:55:21.631 --> 00:55:22.966
{\an8}MODERATOR: CAPTAIN

00:55:24.843 --> 00:55:25.677
"Captain"?

00:55:37.188 --> 00:55:39.399
HANMIN ALMOST LOSES BILLIONS OF WON
DUE TO ORDER MISTAKE

00:55:39.482 --> 00:55:41.943
What should you do
if the media asks for an interview?

00:55:42.026 --> 00:55:43.611
I will not respond to them.

00:55:43.695 --> 00:55:47.448
I will let Admin and the PR Division
know about the request immediately.

00:55:49.450 --> 00:55:52.328
The Financial Supervisory Service
will be here for an investigation today.

00:55:53.371 --> 00:55:55.415
It's just a formality,
but they could speak to you.

00:55:56.332 --> 00:55:57.250
So be prepared.

00:55:59.002 --> 00:56:00.378
The Financial Supervisory Service?

00:56:01.629 --> 00:56:05.800
Who knew we'd be inspecting
Hanmin's internal oversight?

00:56:06.593 --> 00:56:10.722
If Hong Keum-bo were around,
she would've insisted on being here.

00:56:11.347 --> 00:56:12.348
Just imagine.

00:56:13.433 --> 00:56:14.392
- Hey.
- Yes?

00:56:15.727 --> 00:56:17.854
We're here to perform our official duties.

00:56:17.937 --> 00:56:19.272
Take it seriously, okay?

00:56:20.481 --> 00:56:23.109
I was filling out the sell order
when I got thirsty.

00:56:23.193 --> 00:56:25.153
When I was looking around for my cup,

00:56:25.236 --> 00:56:27.530
a female employee I didn't recognize
suddenly jumped in.

00:56:28.406 --> 00:56:31.618
She misunderstood the situation
and caused this mess.

00:56:31.701 --> 00:56:32.869
So you're saying

00:56:33.912 --> 00:56:35.205
that you made a simple mistake?

00:56:36.581 --> 00:56:37.415
I feel wronged.

00:56:38.666 --> 00:56:41.502
Why would I ever do anything like that
and throw away my whole career?

00:56:42.086 --> 00:56:45.798
Shouldn't we first speak to
Ms. Hong Jang-mi and hear her out?

00:56:47.884 --> 00:56:48.927
Shut it.

00:56:50.595 --> 00:56:53.681
We believe he made an honest mistake.

00:56:55.808 --> 00:56:58.019
It was a devastating mistake
that could've tarnished

00:56:58.102 --> 00:57:00.772
the sterling reputation
of Hanmin Investment & Securities.

00:57:01.481 --> 00:57:02.649
Excuse me.

00:57:03.483 --> 00:57:05.818
Could you get us Ms. Hong Jang-mi--

00:57:12.742 --> 00:57:14.494
Someone could be lying.

00:57:14.577 --> 00:57:15.703
Just shut up already.

00:57:15.787 --> 00:57:17.455
Right? President Shin?

00:57:20.458 --> 00:57:21.501
Ms. Go.

00:57:22.252 --> 00:57:24.921
Please summon Ms. Hong Jang-mi
from the Risk Management Division.

00:57:25.505 --> 00:57:27.382
Yes, sir. I'll see to it immediately.

00:57:47.735 --> 00:57:49.195
You've reached Risk Management.

00:57:49.279 --> 00:57:51.197
Hong Jang-mi,
the president is asking for you.

00:57:51.281 --> 00:57:52.448
You'd better run up here.

00:57:54.033 --> 00:57:55.034
Right now?

00:58:08.965 --> 00:58:10.550
Why do you look like that?

00:58:13.344 --> 00:58:14.596
I'm just a bit nervous.

00:58:38.077 --> 00:58:39.120
Where's everyone?

00:58:39.203 --> 00:58:41.164
That's why I told you to hurry.

00:58:41.247 --> 00:58:43.541
It was a complete mess.

00:58:43.625 --> 00:58:46.377
Please summon Ms. Hong Jang-mi
from the Risk Management Division.

00:58:46.878 --> 00:58:48.880
Yes, sir. I'll see to it immediately.

00:58:57.263 --> 00:58:58.431
{\an8}ANTACID

00:59:09.525 --> 00:59:10.652
Sir?

00:59:11.903 --> 00:59:13.488
- What's wrong?
- Are you okay, sir?

00:59:14.447 --> 00:59:15.448
Sir?

00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:18.868
Sir, are you all right? What's wrong?

00:59:20.953 --> 00:59:23.331
- Call for an ambulance now! Hurry!
- Okay.

00:59:23.414 --> 00:59:25.208
Sir, are you all right?

00:59:27.502 --> 00:59:28.795
What's wrong, sir?

00:59:30.254 --> 00:59:31.255
Sir?

00:59:36.052 --> 00:59:37.553
That hurts, you punk.

00:59:38.137 --> 00:59:40.598
He's hurting! He's in pain!

00:59:41.391 --> 00:59:42.225
Sir.

00:59:42.308 --> 00:59:44.143
Hold on a second.

00:59:48.106 --> 00:59:49.065
Keep hitting him.

00:59:49.148 --> 00:59:51.859
Sir! Director Yun!

00:59:51.943 --> 00:59:54.153
YEOUIDO HANUI HOSPITAL

01:00:00.910 --> 01:00:02.245
If it weren't for my killer acting skills,

01:00:02.328 --> 01:00:04.997
your whole operation
would've been belly up.

01:00:05.790 --> 01:00:06.791
Hey.

01:00:06.874 --> 01:00:08.167
You pay for this today.

01:00:09.919 --> 01:00:11.421
You're really okay, right?

01:00:12.046 --> 01:00:15.133
There are plenty of fake patients here
who are worse off than me.

01:00:15.216 --> 01:00:17.135
Besides, you're in no place
to worry about me.

01:00:17.218 --> 01:00:19.512
You just worry about yourself, okay?

01:00:20.179 --> 01:00:22.014
Hanmin Investment & Securities

01:00:22.598 --> 01:00:24.350
has decided to conclude this by firing

01:00:24.434 --> 01:00:27.186
Hong Jang-mi, the entry-level minion
with a high school diploma.

01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:28.855
You're their scapegoat.

01:00:29.814 --> 01:00:30.982
You'd better prepare for your return.

01:00:31.899 --> 01:00:34.068
Why would I be kicked out?
I refuse to leave.

01:00:34.819 --> 01:00:37.989
Can you look into the accounts
of Assistant Manager Jung in Trading?

01:00:38.072 --> 01:00:40.450
I'm sure he received
a retainer fee beforehand.

01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:43.161
We'll carry out
an internal probe of our own.

01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:49.000
Our higher-ups

01:00:50.585 --> 01:00:52.587
have already been swept off their feet.

01:00:53.254 --> 01:00:54.213
What?

01:00:57.341 --> 01:01:02.305
One day, we'll be together

01:01:03.055 --> 01:01:07.685
Even if we're apart now

01:01:08.186 --> 01:01:13.524
My very existence depends on yours

01:01:14.108 --> 01:01:20.615
I'm only alive because you exist

01:01:25.912 --> 01:01:29.081
The Korean stock market
is only open from nine to three.

01:01:29.165 --> 01:01:30.833
So why the hell
does it get busier and nastier

01:01:30.917 --> 01:01:32.376
after the sun goes down?

01:01:36.756 --> 01:01:38.549
That's Chairman Kang's specialty.

01:01:39.258 --> 01:01:40.760
Cash handouts under the table.

01:01:46.307 --> 01:01:48.726
Don't tell me you're jealous.

01:01:49.852 --> 01:01:51.312
- Yeah.
- What?

01:01:52.355 --> 01:01:54.023
No, it's nothing.

01:01:56.025 --> 01:01:58.945
His son-in-law is a former official
at the Ministry of Finance and Economy

01:01:59.028 --> 01:02:00.988
and my immediate senior
in the civil service.

01:02:02.657 --> 01:02:03.950
Jeez.

01:02:04.033 --> 01:02:06.118
Money follows connections.

01:02:06.619 --> 01:02:09.121
And I have no connections whatsoever.

01:02:10.331 --> 01:02:12.291
You don't need to take it that far.

01:02:14.001 --> 01:02:14.836
However!

01:02:16.295 --> 01:02:19.131
Even today,
I invested in you, Hong Keum-bo!

01:02:19.215 --> 01:02:20.049
A long-term investment!

01:02:21.008 --> 01:02:23.177
So don't forget that
and keep digging until the end.

01:02:24.262 --> 01:02:26.055
I'll extend your leave as much as I can.

01:02:41.696 --> 01:02:42.947
Slow down.

01:02:46.367 --> 01:02:47.451
That's too hot.

01:02:47.535 --> 01:02:49.120
DISCIPLINARY HEARING NOTICE

01:02:49.203 --> 01:02:50.872
{\an8}HONG JANG-MI, RISK MANAGEMENT DIVISION

01:02:50.955 --> 01:02:52.665
{\an8}GROUNDS: HANYE ELECTRONICS ORDER ERROR

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:01.048
What's a disciplinary hearing?

01:03:05.511 --> 01:03:09.181
It's putting a bad employee on stage
to punish them for their wrongdoing.

01:03:10.725 --> 01:03:13.728
And what exactly did I do wrong?

01:03:24.906 --> 01:03:27.825
We're planning to dismiss Ms. Hong,
the one who reported the incident

01:03:27.909 --> 01:03:29.076
to the Korea Exchange.

01:03:29.994 --> 01:03:31.871
She didn't do anything wrong.

01:03:31.954 --> 01:03:33.706
It sounds like she'll be terribly wronged.

01:03:33.789 --> 01:03:37.752
Grievances may be resolved
through proper compensation.

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:43.424
A leader must put the organization
before personal sentiments.

01:03:44.467 --> 01:03:47.803
I believe you understand
what I'm trying to say.

01:03:51.223 --> 01:03:54.560
President Shin, why don't you give us
your reasoning first?

01:03:54.644 --> 01:03:55.603
Yes, sir.

01:03:56.228 --> 01:03:58.064
There are three people involved.

01:03:58.147 --> 01:03:59.982
A general manager, a trader,
and a staff member.

01:04:00.775 --> 01:04:02.526
If someone has to take responsibility,

01:04:02.610 --> 01:04:05.446
the entry-level employee
would pose the least risk.

01:04:05.529 --> 01:04:06.364
And…

01:04:06.447 --> 01:04:07.406
And?

01:04:09.033 --> 01:04:10.618
It will also be the easiest.

01:04:13.329 --> 01:04:14.163
Good.

01:04:16.207 --> 01:04:17.625
Pay attention, Albert.

01:04:17.708 --> 01:04:19.001
You need to learn this.

01:04:19.085 --> 01:04:20.544
Watch and learn, kid.

01:04:23.005 --> 01:04:25.716
I'll continue trying my best
to become a good mentor.

01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:28.719
Great. Thank you very much.

01:04:45.736 --> 01:04:47.571
Hanmin Investment & Securities

01:04:47.655 --> 01:04:49.156
has decided to conclude this by firing

01:04:49.949 --> 01:04:52.576
Hong Jang-mi, the entry-level minion
with a high school diploma.

01:04:53.077 --> 01:04:54.912
You're their scapegoat.

01:05:00.418 --> 01:05:01.919
She didn't even have dinner.

01:05:02.003 --> 01:05:04.422
She'll be fine.
She's young and full of life.

01:05:04.505 --> 01:05:05.673
What if Jang-mi gets fired?

01:05:05.756 --> 01:05:07.383
She'll be fine. She's young.

01:05:07.466 --> 01:05:08.884
She's clever.

01:05:08.968 --> 01:05:10.344
She'll find another job in no time.

01:05:14.181 --> 01:05:15.016
What?

01:05:30.197 --> 01:05:31.782
It's already our second team meeting.

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:36.871
Who knew it'd be
for Ms. Hong's disciplinary hearing?

01:05:38.414 --> 01:05:39.665
Ms. Hong.

01:05:46.756 --> 01:05:49.467
You might be too young
to know about this masterpiece,

01:05:49.550 --> 01:05:53.345
but this 1976 American film
helped shape the man I am today.

01:05:54.388 --> 01:05:56.390
After a boxing match,
the protagonist, Rocky,

01:05:56.891 --> 01:05:58.059
screams out, "Adrian!"

01:05:58.893 --> 01:05:59.935
his girlfriend's name.

01:06:00.728 --> 01:06:02.313
That's when the audience realizes it.

01:06:03.272 --> 01:06:04.106
He, in fact,

01:06:04.899 --> 01:06:06.317
was not defeated.

01:06:08.110 --> 01:06:09.570
Rocky loses on points.

01:06:13.157 --> 01:06:14.325
What I'm trying to say is,

01:06:14.408 --> 01:06:17.119
don't talk back in there
like you do with us.

01:06:17.870 --> 01:06:20.623
And don't be too disappointed
if it doesn't go your way.

01:06:21.123 --> 01:06:23.459
I can always write you
a recommendation letter.

01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:28.589
More importantly, the most iconic scene
in Rocky isn't the final one.

01:06:31.258 --> 01:06:34.095
Despite having nothing but poverty
and a tattered tank top to his name,

01:06:34.804 --> 01:06:38.099
Rocky meets heavyweight champion Apollo
without backing down and declares

01:06:39.558 --> 01:06:41.685
that he does not participate
in fixed fights.

01:06:44.772 --> 01:06:45.856
I'll be back.

01:06:53.114 --> 01:06:54.865
So you want her to get beaten up?

01:06:54.949 --> 01:06:56.617
Come on, Mr. Oh.

01:06:57.201 --> 01:06:58.536
No, that's not what I meant.

01:06:59.787 --> 01:07:00.788
Rocky…

01:07:01.914 --> 01:07:05.626
I wasn't sure if I should tell you
what Hong Keum-bo had been up to.

01:07:05.709 --> 01:07:08.420
After all that, Keum-bo joined
the Financial Supervisory Service

01:07:08.504 --> 01:07:11.006
and was successful enough
to be called the Witch of Yeouido.

01:07:11.090 --> 01:07:12.758
That is, before she screwed herself over.

01:07:12.842 --> 01:07:15.010
What do you mean by that?

01:07:15.094 --> 01:07:18.305
She was trying to go after Hanmin
and their slush fund recently,

01:07:18.389 --> 01:07:21.517
but things went awry,
and she was demoted to a regional office.

01:07:23.435 --> 01:07:24.270
Jung-woo.

01:07:24.854 --> 01:07:26.272
Just let her be.

01:07:26.355 --> 01:07:27.606
Don't look for her.

01:07:27.690 --> 01:07:29.275
She wouldn't want to see us.

01:07:29.358 --> 01:07:31.235
We turned our backs on her, after all.

01:07:31.318 --> 01:07:33.988
She was really young then too.

01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:37.741
One minute.

01:07:40.995 --> 01:07:43.747
Sir, the disciplinary hearing
will start at 9:30.

01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:48.377
All right. Thank you.

01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:49.378
I'll be in touch.

01:08:44.725 --> 01:08:45.768
{\an8}HANMIN FINANCIAL AUDIT

01:08:45.851 --> 01:08:47.228
{\an8}9 YEARS AGO, 1988
CHEONGSAN ACCOUNTING FIRM, SEOUL

01:08:47.311 --> 01:08:49.355
{\an8}What is it? Are there a lot of issues?

01:08:49.438 --> 01:08:52.733
Hanmin made sure
the numbers added up before sending them.

01:08:53.609 --> 01:08:55.694
They can't do that.

01:08:56.612 --> 01:08:59.823
Inflated financials, cooked books,

01:08:59.907 --> 01:09:01.659
and audit report wordplay.

01:09:02.326 --> 01:09:03.244
It's all unacceptable.

01:09:03.327 --> 01:09:05.079
- Mr. Yun.
- Yes, sir?

01:09:05.162 --> 01:09:08.749
You're right, the kid is bright,
but she's also clueless.

01:09:12.544 --> 01:09:14.421
CHEONGSAN ACCOUNTING FIRM
CEO KIM NAK-JEONG

01:09:14.505 --> 01:09:16.340
CPA SHIN JUNG-WOO

01:09:19.468 --> 01:09:23.389
Hanmin Investment & Securities
is a VIP client at our accounting firm.

01:09:23.472 --> 01:09:26.684
If we feign just a bit of ignorance,

01:09:26.767 --> 01:09:29.561
we all get to reap the benefits.

01:09:30.062 --> 01:09:31.814
A lie that benefits all.

01:09:31.897 --> 01:09:34.441
No such thing exists.

01:09:34.525 --> 01:09:35.859
{\an8}Hey!

01:09:35.943 --> 01:09:38.279
{\an8}I'll be sure to explain it to her
so she understands, sir.

01:09:38.362 --> 01:09:40.322
What an idiot.

01:09:44.702 --> 01:09:45.869
Jung-woo, can you step outside?

01:10:04.638 --> 01:10:05.848
Sorry, Keum-bo.

01:10:05.931 --> 01:10:09.351
I'll persuade him to do the right thing.

01:10:10.978 --> 01:10:12.730
Sir…

01:10:14.857 --> 01:10:16.233
Don't be a stranger now.

01:10:16.317 --> 01:10:18.610
In the Hanmin accounting fraud case…

01:10:18.694 --> 01:10:20.821
All right. Let's see this through.

01:10:20.904 --> 01:10:23.157
- Please take good care of us.
- Thank you.

01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:26.201
Taking care of the country's economy
is no joke.

01:10:26.285 --> 01:10:28.120
- Get back safely, sir.
- Sure. Thanks.

01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:30.581
CHEONGSAN ACCOUNTING FIRM

01:10:30.664 --> 01:10:34.251
Mr. Yun, the accountant
who was being investigated by the police,

01:10:34.335 --> 01:10:36.920
committed suicide
by jumping from his apartment building

01:10:37.004 --> 01:10:37.963
around 3 p.m. today.

01:10:46.764 --> 01:10:47.806
Don't do anything.

01:10:48.349 --> 01:10:49.975
Let's do as I say, just this once.

01:10:50.893 --> 01:10:51.769
Stay quiet.

01:10:52.478 --> 01:10:53.645
Stay quiet about what?

01:10:54.730 --> 01:10:55.939
Someone died.

01:10:56.023 --> 01:10:57.941
The company will make that right somehow.

01:10:58.025 --> 01:10:59.693
- So we just--
- You.

01:11:00.319 --> 01:11:01.779
You shouldn't do that.

01:11:01.862 --> 01:11:03.447
You can't!

01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:05.657
What does clinging to that
so-called conscience get you?

01:11:05.741 --> 01:11:07.868
It's not about gains.
It's about not losing it!

01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:15.209
And is whatever you gain worth losing me?

01:11:58.794 --> 01:12:00.796
{\an8}HONG JANG-MI

01:12:12.474 --> 01:12:13.684
Hello.

01:12:13.767 --> 01:12:15.144
I am Hong Jang-mi.

01:12:57.478 --> 01:12:59.313
{\an8}UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

01:12:59.897 --> 01:13:02.399
{\an8}A post on Yeouido Pirates
claims you were fired.

01:13:02.483 --> 01:13:04.276
{\an8}- Is it true?
- Me?

01:13:04.359 --> 01:13:06.111
{\an8}There are rumors
that an insider was involved

01:13:06.195 --> 01:13:08.155
{\an8}in the Hanye Electronics incident.

01:13:08.238 --> 01:13:09.323
{\an8}Oh my g--

01:13:09.406 --> 01:13:11.992
{\an8}I'll expose the truth.
I refuse to leave until I do.

01:13:12.075 --> 01:13:12.910
{\an8}I refuse!

01:13:14.077 --> 01:13:15.787
{\an8}What is all this?

01:13:16.330 --> 01:13:17.956
{\an8}Why do things keep blowing up?

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:19.708
{\an8}Why? I need to find Yehppee!

01:13:19.791 --> 01:13:21.293
{\an8}I found you, my peacock!

01:13:21.376 --> 01:13:22.211
{\an8}Do you want to hang out?

01:13:22.294 --> 01:13:23.754
{\an8}I despise romance.

01:13:24.463 --> 01:13:26.215
{\an8}Don't tell me you're here to see me.

01:13:26.298 --> 01:13:28.342
{\an8}I'm not here for you, Ms. Hong Jang-mi.

01:13:28.884 --> 01:13:30.636
{\an8}I'm here for Hong Keum-bo.

01:13:32.387 --> 01:13:37.392
