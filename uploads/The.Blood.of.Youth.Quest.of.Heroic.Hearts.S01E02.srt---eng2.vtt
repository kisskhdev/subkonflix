00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:20.310
Si!

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:21.280
Look at him.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.120
Look at him.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.590
Si! Si!

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.150
Where is everyone else?

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.150
Where is everyone else?

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:42.800
Who's doing this?

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.750
Who's doing this?

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.630
Weigui.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.800
Where are you?

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:49.520
Show yourself!

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.750
Is anyone hurt?

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.470
Where is everyone else?

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.150
Who's trying to play tricks?

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.800
Come out now.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.630
Don't just hide.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.030
Fight me if you can!

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.150
You're quite smart.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.710
I am not like those fools.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.000
Where are those two kids?

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.800
Where?

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:43.710
The mastermind

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.150
is laying out

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.470
a huge trap,

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.470
waiting to collect our lives,

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.430
one after another.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.560
We're not that important.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.360
It seems like the culprit

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.840
is after the Skysplitter.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.590
My guts tell me that the secret door is the exit.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.080
Should we take it?

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.910
Let's try.

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.830
It seems like

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.040
there are two temples.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:24.480
One yin

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:25.390
and one yang.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.430
The door is still sealed.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.120
If this is a trap,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.270
then naturally, you can't unlock the door from inside.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.040
Let's search for any contraption.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.310
It's you!

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.750
You despicable scoundrel.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.430
You've been lying to me.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.240
Everyone wants the Skysplitter.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.750
And I shall start with the fragment you have.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.510
So long as I breathe,

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.390
you shall never have

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.390
the fragment.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.240
Where is it?

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.270
My friends.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.680
How come you two

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.240
are fine?

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.270
Of course.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.000
We

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.720
put up an act

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.800
to

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.750
lure you out.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.720
It's the same place.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:50.000
He's dead.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:56.070
He was probably inflicted

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.750
with a cold toxin.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:02.680
But

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.430
there is no snowman in this place.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.630
How did he come into contact with the cold toxin?

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.270
We

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:12.680
have been misled.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.630
Misled?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.480
Look.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:16.630
There's a wound here.

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:18.870
Someone nearby

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:20.750
pricked him with a needle.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.750
If I'm not mistaken,

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.720
the creepy snowmen

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.830
are intended to be distractions.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:33.680
The culprit

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:35.870
might

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.240
be among us.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.000
You

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:45.830
sure are ruthless.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.160
Instead of fighting, you opted for tricks.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.270
You even killed your own

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.160
to get your hands on the fragments.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:07:59.390
San!

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.510
San, are you okay?

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:06.600
No one on the other side

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.160
was spared, I bet.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:12.000
I...

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.310
I don't want the fragment anymore.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.510
I don't want the fragment anymore.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:16.920
Let's talk.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.480
Think about the bigger picture.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.830
We can work together

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.270
and find a way out first.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.560
You'll be in charge,

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:23.240
okay?

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.480
Despicable scum.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.600
I might just kill you.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.720
Try it if you dare.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:51.670
I'll drag one of you with me.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:53.670
One of us?

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:01.550
Weigui.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:03.320
You're poisoned.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.030
Give us the antidote.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.030
I don't have the antidote.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.480
That is mine.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.910
Give it back.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.630
Qin Aoxiong.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:31.840
You're the descendant of a general.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.440
Give it back.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.790
Give it back!

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:39.480
A descendant of a prestigious clan.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:41.270
Yet you

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:44.720
committed such an unscrupulous deed.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.320
No!

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.630
My late father

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.080
gave it to me.

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:10.960
And you destroyed it!

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.790
What did I do

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.440
to deserve such a fate?

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:24.480
I hereby dictate His Majesty's

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:26.320
imperial decree.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.480
I have been working tirelessly to govern the nation.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:33.120
Fortunately, you, Qin Su, my loyal minister,

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.000
with your exceptional bravery on the battlefield,

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:36.270
have killed

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.440
2,067 enemies.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.150
This feat struck bandits with fear,

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:42.390
ensuring peace on the border.

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:44.510
The society feels safe, and the people

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:46.750
are protected because of you.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:48.480
I am delighted to have you as my minister,

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:50.150
and thus, I bestow upon you this special gift

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.390
so that everyone will learn of your achievements.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:53.840
Thank you,

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:54.790
Your Majesty.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.550
General Qin.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.150
This is

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.360
a gift from His Majesty.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.840
It is the rarest gift

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:06.390
in this world.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.750
Open it and take a look.

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.480
What...

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:16.910
What is the meaning of this?

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.670
There is no gift.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.750
Your death is the gift.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:27.670
Rare gift?

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:31.670
His Majesty is fearful of the descendants of the prestigious clans

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:33.080
like me.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.360
So he poisoned us.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.600
I am not long for this world

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:38.080
because of the cold toxin.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.550
No matter how hard I practice, my martial arts skills will not progress.

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:44.270
So I can only find the Skysplitter

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:46.240
to avenge my late father.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.630
You are the son of a loyal general.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.480
Hand over the antidote

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.200
and we will spare you.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.870
He has taken many lives.

00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:00.270
We have no right to pardon him on behalf of the innocent.

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:02.910
If I can never get the Skysplitter,

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:05.630
there's no reason for me to live.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:08.440
Father.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.030
I have done my best.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.270
Oh, no.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.390
He's dead.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:28.510
Your cold toxin...

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:30.870
Weigui.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:31.390
Weigui.

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:35.270
Weigui.

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.270
If I hadn't been training with cold qi since I was little,

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.550
I would've been dead like them.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:51.200
I'm not strong enough.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.390
I can only suppress the cold toxin in you momentarily.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:54.750
Right now, we must

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.320
look for an antidote.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.390
But we can't even get out of here.

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:11.720
Is anyone out there?

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:13.870
I am Lei Lingze

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.390
of Lei's Stronghold.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:16.750
I have

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:19.150
the Skysplitter fragment.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.120
As you already know,

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:22.720
when the Skysplitter appears,

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.000
the world will be upended.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:25.720
If you want it,

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.200
come here and take it.

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:28.390
Stop shouting.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:30.630
Are you trying to make sure

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:31.840
you'll die once you get out?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:37.390
Now that

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.200
you are my sidekick,

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:40.840
I must protect you.

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:44.030
Even if I'll die,

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:46.910
I'll make sure you'll get out of here.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.790
I just arrived here and I overheard

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.630
the declaration of such strong camaraderie.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:53.600
How touching.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.270
My friend.

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:56.750
Is there a contraption out there

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.000
that can unlock this door?

00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.870
If you can free us,

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.000
I

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.270
will reward you handsomely.

[Ye Zhixin]

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:20.320
Thank you for helping us.

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:21.360
How may I

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:22.390
address you?

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.080
I'm Ye

I'm Lei Lingze.

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:27.910
I'm

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:28.910
Weigui.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.080
Weigui?

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.270
About the Skysplitter fragment...

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:40.240
About the Skysplitter fragment...

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.440
The Skysplitter fragment

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.000
is a lie he made up

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:44.390
to escape.

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:45.670
He doesn't have it.

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:47.200
But we'll try

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:48.320
to give you whatever you want.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:51.390
It's okay.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:52.870
I wasn't expecting any reward

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:54.240
from saving you two.

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:55.840
Consider yourself lucky that I'm feeling

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.790
kind today.

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:57.960
Besides,

00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.270
Weigui is afflicted with the cold toxin.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.870
You should get him treated.

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.750
Okay.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.150
May we meet again.

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:46.630
You killed innocents just to get your hands

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.870
on the Skysplitter fragments.

is not a novel trick.

I'm acting under the orders of the Sect Leader of Tianwaitian.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.360

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.600
and that she was a rare martial arts prodigy.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.670
At the age of 18,

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.720
she attained the Unfettered Celestial Stage.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.030
I am nothing but a man

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:27.720
who is on his last legs.

Don't.
