[Our Dazzling Days]

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.680
[Episode 5]

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.670
Come on, Xiaoman. Over here.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.570
It seems they can't push it out.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.170
Come here.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.110
Let's wait for him to come over.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.870
Come here. Over here.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:49.300
Here.

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:50.560
Come on.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.640
Come on. One, two, three!

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:54.310
One, two, three!

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.380
One, two, three!

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.070
Alright.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.210
Alright.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.500
Thank you guys.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.350
Thanks.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.050
Why didn't you wave?

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.520
Why didn't you wave, huh?

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.199
Why, what's wrong?

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.400
Isn't Xiaodan your little girlfriend?

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.360
That's Xiaodan.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:16.150
Let me tell you,

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.040
I didn't ask for a cent.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.270
I did it for your sake.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.120
I'm a good friend, aren't I?

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.220
I'm going back. I quit.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.440
Wait.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.360
I didn't take any money.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.960
Hey, I was helping your girlfriend.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.810
Why are you leaving?

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.070
You guys do your thing.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.870
Are you busy, Ge?

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.660
Yeah, I am.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.160
There's a question I don't get.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.090
Can you teach me?

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.460
Why are you like this?
I really don't get it.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:46.320
Move your hand.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.950
Just help me with this one. Just this one.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.750
I've explained this question to you
a million times,

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.210
and you still don't get it?

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.190
I'm a liberal arts student, Sis.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.030
We liberal arts students

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.480
just can't compare to
you science students.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.140
We're dumb.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:59.560
Please, just explain

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.420
this question to me one more time.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.400
-Okay?
-I can't.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:03.630
Why not?

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:04.680
You didn't even look.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.520
I'm talking about this one.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.250
It's not the one from last time.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.910
Rectangle ABCD...

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.370
What are you doing?

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.040
Come up here and listen.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.910
Fold it along AC.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.829
The key point of this question is

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.030
that this is a rectangle.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.960
So these two angles must be equal.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.329
And if you fold it over,
these two angles are also equal.

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.030
This is a symmetrical triangle.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.710
These are both right triangles.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.280
Let EF be X,

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.560
and we already know AE equals 6.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.090
-Xiaoman.
-And EC equals 6.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.680
As I just told you,
these are symmetrical angles...

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.210
Xiaoman!

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.840
Pass it to me. Quick. Pass it.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.760
Come on. Pass it to me.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.090
-Pass it to me.
-Come on.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.050
-Lulu, here.
-Then CF equals 8 minus X...

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:52.870
Here. Catch.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.030
He doesn't know how to catch.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.150
Xiaoman, pass it to me.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.190
Isn't it much easier now?

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.470
Pass it to me. Me.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.030
Pass it to me.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.260
Don't pass it to him. Pass it to me.
Quick.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.120
Come on, quick.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.040
Pass it to me.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.630
Sun Lulu! Are you listening or not?

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.120
I am. I am.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.590
-I am listening.
-Here you are!

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:06.680
That's X, right?

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.410
And then A...

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.520
Look at you two.
You just had to play ball inside.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.580
Now you've hit her.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.040
It hit her in the face?

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.540
Lulu, can you still see?

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.700
Lulu.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.360
Where are you hit?

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.410
Are you okay?

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.070
It hurts.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:33.320
Let me see.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.320
Let me help you up.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.430
I... I can't move.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.800
Lulu,

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.170
you have to be okay.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.600
If anything happens to you,

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.120
how am I supposed to live?

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.000
Lulu.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.270
Lulu, say something! Lulu!

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.180
If anything happens to you,

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.360
how am I supposed to live?

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.270
Come on, give me your hand.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.510
I'll take you to the hospital. Let's go.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:55.600
Yeah, take her to the hospital.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.600
Let me help you up.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.510
Hurry, get up first.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.360
Help her up.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.840
Come on, give me your hand.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.850
I'll take you to the hospital. Let's go.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:02.930
Give them a hand.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.200
This...

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:07.430
What should we do?

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.960
Xiaoman.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.360
Xiaoman, come give me a hand!

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.270
I can't move her!

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.090
Xiaoman, hurry!

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.120
-Take her to the hospital.
-Come on.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.190
-Xiaoman.
-Hurry up. Come on.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.250
Make way. Make way.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.240
Sun Lulu fell.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.310
Make way! Come on, make way!

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.270
Make way! Make way! Everyone, move aside!

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.040
Make way! Come on.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.570
Be careful, don't bump her.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.380
Move aside!

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:21.450
Get out of our way!

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.160
What's happening with them?

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.750
Looks like Xiaoman and Sun Lulu
are becoming a couple.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.750
He was running around carrying her.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.340
What kind of nonsense is that?

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.510
If you two wanted to play,
you could've just played by yourselves.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.080
Why did you have to
keep throwing the ball at me?

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.080
Look at this mess.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.040
A girl

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.800
coming all the way from three floors up

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.280
to our classroom

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.590
to ask such a complex math question—

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.560
d-do you think that was normal?

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.830
Whether it was normal or not,

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.720
you shouldn't have thrown the ball at me.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.020
You still don't get it?

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.800
Get what?

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.520
She definitely wanted to get my attention.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.120
Why would she want your attention?
You know how to solve the question?

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.310
Want your attention my foot.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.240
You couldn't even catch a ball.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.160
Give me a break.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.570
Right, I couldn't catch it.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.540
B-But do you really think
she couldn't catch it?

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.040
She definitely did it on purpose.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.360
She wanted to make me anxious,

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.460
make me go grab the ball
and play with her.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.520
She just wanted to be friends with me.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.040
You're really overthinking this.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.360
Whether she could catch it or not,

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:36.750
she's actually bleeding now.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.570
Alright.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:44.720
Stop crying.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.930
That's much better.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.510
It's much easier to understand now.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.620
Lulu,

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.360
are you feeling better?

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.530
If you are, let's finish going over
that question from earlier.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:06:59.120
Ge,

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.140
my memory is a bit fuzzy.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.120
Who do you think
hit me with the ball just now,

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.790
Wang Dongdong or Xiaoman?

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.950
No one hit you.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:14.480
You fell on your own.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.500
I fell on my own? No way.

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:19.710
It must have been Xiaoman.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.980
I shouldn't have bothered
explaining the question to you.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.070
Hello, guys, excuse me.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:33.510
Could you give me a hand?

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:34.960
-Sure.
-No problem.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:36.730
Careful.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:37.430
Come on. Careful. One, two.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:38.560
One, two, three, up!

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:39.560
Alright.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.120
Thanks.

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:41.430
No, no, no. Actually...

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:42.720
I'm going that way. That way.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.120
Alright, alright.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:43.870
Actually, never mind.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:44.360
I'll do it myself.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.240
-I can roll it myself.
-It's fine.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.640
Really, no need. No need.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.850
I'll do it myself!

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:49.550
Thanks, both of you!

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.870
Alright then, take care.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:51.470
Take care.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:58.680
Xiaoman!

00:07:59.120 --> 00:07:59.680
Xiaoman.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:01.720
What's up?

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:03.020
Here.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:05.450
Thanks.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.240
Look at you,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.190
rolling in in your special ride again?

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:10.160
Xiaoman, want some gum?

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.560
I-I'll pass.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.750
Have a piece. It's really sweet.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:13.510
I really don't want any.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:14.430
Just try some.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.190
Stop it. Just give it to me.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.210
Okay, let him eat it. It's fine.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Xiaoman, I'm off then.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.510
Be careful when playing basketball.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:27.590
Alright. Go do your thing.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:28.520
I'm heading out.

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:30.600
What are you doing, Wang Dongdong?

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.270
No need, no need.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:32.270
I'll do it myself.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:33.750
What are you doing? I can do it myself.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:34.789
Let go!

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:36.909
-Let's go.
-What's your problem?

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:37.770
Fine, you push.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:39.690
I'm feeling dizzy.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:42.710
I know.

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:45.480
You're mad at me
for hurting your head, right?

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.360
Just go away!

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:47.740
You're so annoying.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:48.400
Be careful.

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:50.770
Go on. Be careful.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:53.410
Xiaoman, I'm leaving.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:54.610
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.640
How did she know I was here?

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.510
It's such a small place.
There's nothing you can miss.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:03.720
Look at her, being shy about
giving me a piece of gum.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.840
"Xiaoman, do you want some?"

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.170
Putting on all that act.

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:11.720
If you want to apologize to her,

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:12.880
just say it directly.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.440
Why are you dilly-dallying?

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.300
I can tell you've never
apologized to a girl before.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.750
You can't be too casual

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:19.880
or too direct.

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:21.730
It needs a sense of ritual.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.070
What sense of ritual?

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:27.340
Hello, lovely Sun Lulu.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.390
There are things I want to say,

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.970
but I don't dare to say them.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.030
But I still want to say them,

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:36.860
even though I'm too shy.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:39.400
You're so wishy-washy.

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:45.800
These are my true feelings.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:48.260
I've figured out how to apologize.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:50.550
I'm telling you,

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.360
don't make it so complicated.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:53.720
Just tell her directly.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.610
Just say sorry and be done with it.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.440
Why bother writing these things?

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.240
I caused Sun Lulu's head injury.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:03.330
Do you really think a simple sorry

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.280
is enough for her to forgive me?

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.530
That's true.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:10.390
Since you hurt her,

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.370
you do need to show some sincerity
in your apologies.

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:16.070
Then go ahead and write it.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.130
My writing skills alone aren't enough.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:20.340
Only with your beautiful handwriting

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:21.910
can I be fully prepared

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:23.530
and leave nothing to chance.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.670
Just say it. What do you want?

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.780
Well, I do have a favor to ask.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.670
Write a letter

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:34.640
to Sun Lulu in my name.

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:36.510
You want me to write this?

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:37.870
Yes, just this.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.580
You really are something.

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.110
Ride faster. Come on.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.560
I'm starving. I'm going to eat
two bowls of noodles when I get home.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.420
I'm hungry too.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.390
I'm going to eat a lot
when I get home later too.

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:52.510
Seriously. Hurry.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.080
Sun Lulu!

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:54.820
Wait, wait.

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:55.790
You go back first.

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:56.320
Lulu.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:58.200
-I'm leaving then.
-Come here.

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:02.070
Wait a second.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.230
What? Were you waiting here just for me?

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:06.630
I've been waiting for ages.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:07.270
What's up?

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:09.070
Someone asked me

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:10.880
to give you something.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:11.550
What is it?

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:13.360
What's this?

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:16.840
Don't read it here.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:17.910
T-Take it home and read it.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:18.720
Wait, what is it?

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.450
I'm leaving.

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:22.720
Xiaoman!

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:25.730
Why so mysterious?

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.480
I was calling you.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.450
Didn't you hear me?

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:33.080
What's up?

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.000
Where are you going?

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:36.880
To find Zhigang again?

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:39.750
Can't I?

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:43.510
I saw you yesterday.

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.840
How could you do that kind of thing?

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:48.870
"That kind of thing"?

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.270
What's wrong with me
earning a little money by pushing cars?

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:52.030
Otherwise,

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:53.630
h-how am I supposed to get by?

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:56.160
Are you that short of money?

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:57.320
You bet I am.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:07.960
Sweetie.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.270
If you're busy,
don't worry about cleaning.

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:10.910
Don't worry about it.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:11.630
I'll handle it.

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:12.750
Mom, I've finished writing my homework.

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:13.670
Let me do it. Give it to me.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:14.930
Alright then. I'll...

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:27.840
"Apply with zeal—

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.030
become an Air Force pilot"?

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:32.110
A pilot?

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:33.570
Don't go, Sweetie.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:34.870
That's too dangerous.

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:35.930
Don't go. Don't go.

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:37.970
You two don't understand.

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:40.480
Being able to fly in our motherland's
blue sky—

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.680
how glorious is that.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.720
So many people want to become pilots

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.910
that they're practically fighting for it.

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:48.080
Director Hou didn't even dare to
announce it publicly.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.940
He only gave the brochures to
the cadres' children.

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:53.270
How could he do that?

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:54.510
That's so unfair.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.550
No wonder I didn't hear about it
at school.

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:57.390
Let me tell you,

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:58.390
no one will get in.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.670
The requirements for pilots
are extremely high.

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:01.480
No chance.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:03.150
Where's my tea?

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.050
It's in the kitchen.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.140
I'll get it for you.

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:07.390
Okay.

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:10.220
Being a pilot.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.130
You know,

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.660
flying airplanes.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:13.570
How awesome.

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:38.800
Morning, Xiaodan.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:39.330
Morning.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.500
What are you doing?

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.630
Isn't this Xiaoman's handwriting?

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:59.540
He insisted that it was from someone else.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:00.840
Who else could it be?

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:03.310
Look.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.010
He wrote this letter to you?

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.120
Exactly. It was such a surprise.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.120
Do you think I should
give him something in return?

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.270
Just replying with a letter

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:15.270
feels a bit too perfunctory, doesn't it?

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:17.550
Xiaodan, do you know how to write
acrostic poems?

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:18.080
I don't.

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:20.910
Look at you.

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.670
I knew you wouldn't know how.

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:24.870
You science student.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:32.040
Get away from me.

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:45.130
Can't you sprinkle some water here?
It's all dusty.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.320
You're here, Xiaoman.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.080
I've been waiting for you for ages.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:48.740
What's with

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:50.030
this look?

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:52.270
Come on, sit.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:53.360
Here.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.330
What is this?

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.460
Take a look.

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:04.680
Recruiting pilots?

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:07.080
From our school?

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:09.010
Let me tell you,

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.770
I think this is perfect for you.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.120
You're already tall and well-built.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.440
With that pilot jacket on,

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.750
you'd definitely look super handsome.

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:16.960
Of course I'd look handsome.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:17.750
I look good in everything.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.480
But this is about being a pilot.

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:21.080
Oh right, you can keep this.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.270
Consider it a reward
for delivering me that letter.

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.800
What did you think
after reading that letter?

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.000
What do you mean what I thought?

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.840
Who asks that?

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:32.780
So annoying.

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:36.220
Why can't I ask?

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.210
I won't tell you even if you ask.

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:39.070
Suit yourself.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.160
I can't be bothered with you.

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:43.690
Pilot...

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.080
What exactly did Sun Lulu say?

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.270
"I won't tell you even if you ask."

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:48.720
But why?

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:49.490
I even...

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:51.270
I even wrote her a letter to apologize.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:52.380
Why can't you tell me?

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:53.660
I'm begging you, okay?

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.770
"I won't tell you even if you ask."

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:56.850
But why?

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:58.520
Why can't you tell me?

00:15:58.840 --> 00:15:59.550
Look at you.

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:00.150
Look at you.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:01.000
So pathetic.

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:02.270
That's exactly what she told me.

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:03.150
Look at you.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.590
Seriously, so pathetic.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.050
Dongdong, let me tell you.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:08.360
Girls

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.720
all love to say the opposite of
what they mean.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:10.600
Not telling you—

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.730
what does that mean?

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:13.750
It means she forgives you.

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:15.160
She's forgiven you.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.640
I love hearing you talk, Xia Lei.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.380
Sun Lulu gave you this?

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:22.080
Yes.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.720
But she only gave me this thing.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.100
T-There's no phone number or address
on it,

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.550
and it doesn't say
how I'm supposed to apply.

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:28.480
Who should I ask?

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:30.000
Ask Hou, of course.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.080
Good point.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.000
Pilot.

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:40.150
Cool.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.120
Director Hou.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.950
Director Hou!

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.160
Zhang Xiaoman, you scared me.

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:57.530
Can't you see I'm busy?

00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:59.590
It's okay, you do your thing.

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:02.120
I heard that
they're recruiting pilots from our school.

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:02.960
I want to apply.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.359
What do I need to prepare?

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.530
Recruiting pilots? Who told you that?

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:07.760
I saw the flyer.

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:10.510
This pilot recruiting thing
is quite complicated,

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:12.030
and the requirements are quite high.

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:14.960
They not only check
the students' motivation and character,

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.619
but also require good grades.

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:19.569
There are many things to be prepared.

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:22.550
It takes a lot more than
just running fast.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.510
Director, you say
there're many things to prepare.

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:26.550
What are they?

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:29.060
Everything.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.060
Just get prepared.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.110
Hello, Director Hou.

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:39.070
What's wrong with you guys?

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:43.080
Didn't I tell you greetings aren't needed
on special occasions?

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:46.820
I scared him.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:49.190
How did it go?

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.280
H-He didn't tell me how to apply.

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:56.480
He just told me
to get thoroughly prepared.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.380
What am I supposed to prepare?

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.090
Isn't he obviously trying to fool you?

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:03.660
Besides,

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:05.640
before he left just now,

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.200
he patted my shoulder twice gently.

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:12.350
Do you think he was giving me a hint,

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.200
or was he just wiping his hands on me?

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.600
What are you chatting about here?
Let's go.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:18.680
Give you a hint?

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.380
I think he was simply
wiping his hands on you.

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:23.570
Simply wiping his hands on me?

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:24.860
That's just mean.

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:27.400
Why do you suddenly want to be a pilot?

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.600
Are you kidding, bro?

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.720
Me, in an Air Force uniform.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.240
Once I put that on,

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:32.990
wouldn't I be

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.000
utterly handsome?

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:38.200
You do have the aura of a soldier.

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:39.550
Right.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.590
I have to learn from my grandpa, right?

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:46.350
Join the army, serve the country,

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:48.190
and serve the people, right?

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:52.380
Most importantly, the army
provides food and lodging, right?

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:54.440
You've really thought this through.

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.430
If you can't ask Director Hou,

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:05.560
why not ask Chief Engineer Yan?

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:06.960
Have Xiaodan ask for you.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:11.920
No, no. I can't.

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:13.070
Why not?

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.530
I can't really talk to Xiaodan these days.

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.930
Why is that?

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.510
The other day,

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:25.200
when Zhigang and the others
were trapping cars,

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.630
they got Chief Engineer Yan's car stuck,

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:27.690
and I was right there.

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:28.660
She saw me.

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:30.680
I'm too ashamed to talk to her.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:31.720
What's the big deal?

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.240
Then just ask someone else.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.960
So many people at our factory

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:36.650
used to serve in the military.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.450
Ask Mr. Ding.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.100
Mr. Ding's a battle hero after all,
isn't he?

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:47.280
Mr. Ding could work.

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:50.910
Let's go. Time for class.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.070
Xia Lei!

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.170
Come help me, quick!

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:04.450
Take two more steps, and I'll come help.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:05.510
Hurry.

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:08.360
I can't carry them anymore.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.080
I'm coming. I'm coming.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.360
Come on, it's just two buckets of water.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:13.640
Here. Give me a bucket.

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:16.040
Let's go.

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:19.450
Last one there is a rotten egg!

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.800
It's indeed quite heavy.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.660
Cut it out.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.280
Why did you get so much water?

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.400
What were you thinking?

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:38.900
I'm applying to be a pilot,

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:39.990
not joining the Navy.

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:43.070
Why did you get so much water for me
to practice holding my breath?

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:45.800
What if your plane gets shot down
by an enemy plane

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:46.850
and falls into the sea?

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:48.480
Why don't you fall into the sea yourself?

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.400
The book says

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:52.260
when ordinary people reach
an altitude of 2,500 meters,

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:53.860
they get altitude sickness.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.730
Planes usually fly in the stratosphere,

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:57.930
which is much higher than 2,500 meters.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.030
So I assume

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:00.350
a pilot's lung capacity

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:02.960
must be much stronger
than that of an average person.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:07.510
So the recruitment test
is bound to check your lung capacity.

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:09.880
I originally wanted to
take you to the river,

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.170
but Xia Lei wouldn't let me.

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:12.820
Didn't you fall into a river once
when you were little?

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:13.950
You're a bit scared of water now.

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:15.200
I just asked you about it.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.230
I'm not scared of water.

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:18.350
I just don't like going near the river.

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:19.550
Look, if it's for breath-holding practice,

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:20.640
wouldn't a basin of water be enough?

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.370
What's with the giant buckets?

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.910
It was my idea.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.780
The point is to simulate you

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:30.840
being completely submerged in water.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.720
But don't worry.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.400
Xia Lei and I will definitely save you.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.040
If you encounter any danger,

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.350
the two of us will be like

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:41.200
Sima Gang smashing... Sima Zhuang...

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.200
Sima...

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.880
Sima Guang smashing the vat.

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:45.690
Right.

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:50.120
Come on. Come here.

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:53.640
This thing right here—

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.720
try smashing it.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.690
If you can smash it, I'll get in.

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:57.540
It's just a metaphor.

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:57.950
Yeah.

00:21:58.170 --> 00:21:59.600
But don't worry about this bucket.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.930
It's totally clean.
I wiped it 3 or 4 times.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.010
It's spotless. Look...

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:08.480
Let's demonstrate
Sima Guang smashing the vat right now!

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:09.480
Smashing the vat!

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:13.540
Can it be smashed?

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.200
How did that feel?

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:17.720
Stop fooling around. Seriously.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.520
Hurry up and practice, Xiaoman.

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:21.170
Smashing the vat my foot.

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:24.870
There's too much water.

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:26.110
Come on. Let's get started.

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:27.510
Get ready. Come on.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.590
Three, two, one.

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:33.770
Let me catch my breath.

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:34.660
Hurry up.

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:35.980
Don't be nervous.

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:38.920
Get ready.

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.920
See? I told you he's scared of water.

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:51.440
He doesn't dare go down.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.160
-Xiaoman!
-Xiaoman!

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:23.670
Xiaoman!

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.880
Xiaoman!

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.200
Come here, Xiaoman!

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:28.030
Grandma.

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:30.880
How about I join the army

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.010
like my grandpa did?

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.340
That would be great, of course.

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:35.580
Look at your height.

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:37.190
In a military uniform,

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.480
you'd look just
as handsome as your grandpa.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:45.510
It's already two and a half minutes.

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:46.770
Two and a half minutes.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:47.770
Xiaoman.

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:50.070
Xiaoman?

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.340
Xiaoman, are you okay?

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:53.100
Did he pass out? Xiaoman?

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:56.480
Okay, okay.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.120
Six.

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.680
-Five.
-It's almost 3 minutes now.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:04.350
Four, three, two, one.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:05.600
That's three minutes!

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.130
Three...

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:09.750
Xiaoman.

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:14.400
Xiaoman!

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:15.010
Save him!

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:19.620
How are you?

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:24.640
Sit down. Sit down.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.350
Y-You didn't have to hold your breath
for so long.

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:27.480
It's been 3 minutes!

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:28.250
I got dizzy.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.350
It's about practicing lung capacity,

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:30.200
not risking your life.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.030
Exactly.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.830
Take a breath. Are you okay?

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:39.500
How do you feel?

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.820
Good for you. Three minutes this time.

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:46.130
Next time you can aim for 4.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.000
Why d-didn't you two pull me out?

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:51.720
We did! How else did you get out?

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:52.880
I tapped your fingers,

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.030
and I thought you reacted.

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:54.680
Really?

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:57.270
You held your breath for too long.

00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:58.460
If you couldn't handle it,
you should've come up.

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:00.320
It was your first time, after all.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.770
No more holding breath.

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:02.740
Once is enough.

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:03.830
That was too scary.

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:05.270
But you did pretty great this time.

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:06.270
Three minutes.

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:08.310
It worked. It worked.

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:09.200
The kite is up. Reel it in.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:09.790
Time to reel it in.

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:10.640
Reel it in.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:11.400
The wind is back.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.130
You alright?

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:12.880
-I am.
-Let it out.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.750
Xiaodan, Xiaodan, look.

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:16.830
Aren't those the boys from our class?

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:17.710
Xiaodan.

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:20.080
We just did some breath-holding practice.

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.160
Why do you three look like drowned rats?

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:25.620
We were helping Xiaoman with
his pilot recruitment training.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:29.400
We're doing

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:32.350
an anti-vertigo training later.

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.350
Time for the next training exercise.

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:36.260
The kite's falling!

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:37.270
Reel it in, reel it in.

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:38.550
Reel it in.

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:39.260
Why did...

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.320
Xiaoman, why did you kick the bucket?

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.030
Well, you guys have fun.

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:45.830
I have things to do.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:46.760
I'm heading out.

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:49.590
Is this...

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:51.200
Is this thing even safe?

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.610
-It is.
-This doesn't look like

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.840
equipment for anti-vertigo training.

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.340
Is this another one of your ideas?

00:25:58.750 --> 00:25:59.600
This spins.

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.700
Is that the same thing?

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:02.640
Well, it does spin.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.640
Just give it a try.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.200
Does this look safe to you?

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:05.830
It is safe.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.070
It's squeaking.

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:07.680
Give it a try.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.940
All the kids play on it.

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:10.270
Give it a try. Come on.

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:12.110
Sit on it.

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:13.800
Right. Sit on the edge.

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:15.230
Or you can lie on top of it.

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:17.430
Get on. Let's spin together.

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:18.480
Spin together?

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.240
You can sit right opposite me.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.070
Then we'll be balanced.

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:21.870
Come on. Let me get seated first.

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:23.640
Are you seated?

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:24.440
Wait a second.

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:25.200
Okay.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.400
Are you ready?

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:29.000
Captain Zhang Xiaoman
and First Officer Xia Lei

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.070
are ready.

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:31.880
Come on, ground crew Dongdong, let's go.

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:32.720

How is it?

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:47.350
Director Hou.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.720
He's doing physical training
for the pilot recruitment!

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.240
I'll definitely practice hard, Director!

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.970
I'll bring honor to our school!

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.400
Good, good. Keep training.

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:57.880
Thank you, Director Hou!

Join me. Join me.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:02.640
I'll count for you.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.640
Come on. One more set!

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:04.370

Xia Lei! Xia Lei.

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:19.990
Xiaodan, why haven't you gone home yet?

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:24.000
Give this to him for me.

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.750
Pilot Training Plan?

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.120
What do you mean?

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:32.030
I'm worried he'll crash and burn
before he even succeeds.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.880
Did you two have a fight recently?

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.070
What happened?

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.680
No, it's just he seems pretty busy.

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:45.740
And with so many people around him,
it's inconvenient.

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:48.040
Don't tell him it's from me.

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.880
I'm helping him
purely out of moral obligation.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:53.720
I'm off.

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:12.530
What's this?

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.760
Mr. Ding, what is this thing?

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:22.720
According to the pilot recruitment plan
provided by Xia Lei,

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.120
this thing was included.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:25.100
I welded it.

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.660
I wouldn't say it's roughly the same—

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:28.680
I'd only say

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:31.130
it's exactly the same.

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:32.170
Get on with it.

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:33.710
You made it yourself?

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:36.690
That's impressive, Mr. Ding.

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:38.210
Is it sturdy?

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:39.790
Who are you insulting?

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:41.070
Don't you know my skills?

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:41.720
Just get on.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.050
It can hold even two of you.

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:43.460
Get on.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.220
This looks pretty fun.

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:48.240
It must be sturdier
than that one in the park.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.490
You... You want me to get on?

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:50.890
You wuss. Are you scared?

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:52.110
How can you be a soldier
if you're like this?

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:53.640
It's... It's nothing to me.

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:54.190
Xiaoman.

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.470
Just put the things on the table.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.200
You need to get used to it.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:58.660
Come on.

00:29:59.070 --> 00:29:59.550
Come on.

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:02.200
Come on. Put your feet...

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:02.920
Put your feet in.

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:03.830
Right. Hold them there.

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:04.550
Hold them.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.240
Okay.

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:07.240
Come on, you all, move aside.

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.400
Move aside.
You don't know how to spin this.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.940
I've spun it before. I know how.

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:11.510
-Can you really do it?
-J-Just let go.

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:12.240
Don't worry.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.440
Dongdong! Dongdong!

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.000
Big brother! Big brother!

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:19.340
Dear lord! Dear lord!

00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:21.680
Dongdong!

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:24.840
Dear lord! Dear lord!

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.240
Dongdong!

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.750
Dongdong, my lord!

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.030
Alright, alright.
This is just a test spin.

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:33.400
Going full force on the first ride
won't work.

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.480
D-Dongdong!

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:36.310
Alright, alright.

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:37.800
I think it's very doable.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.290
Then let me announce it:

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:41.470
the inspection of Zhang Xiaoman's
pilot recruitment training results

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:42.710
officially begins!

00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:45.310
7! 6!

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:46.000
Are you okay?

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:46.830
-Are you okay?
-Xiaoman?

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:52.960
5! 4! 3! 2! 1!

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:53.960
Well done!

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.960
Xiaoman!

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.450
I announce that
he's successfully completed...

00:30:57.450 --> 00:30:57.960
Are you okay?

00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.420
20 spins on the gyroscope!

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:01.200
Impressive.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.640
Dongdong, get the next test ready for me.

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:03.720
-Got it.
-That was really impressive.

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.320
He's really getting into it.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.600
Time for the next test then.

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:10.360
Alright, step on this. Come on.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:11.550
I'll release it.

00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:13.350
This is the... The 10-meter one.

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:16.400
The one where you walk 10 meters
in a straight line after spinning.

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.460
What are you doing?

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:18.250
Ten meters.

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:19.320
Move further away.

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.510
But this spot is exactly 10 meters.

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:21.680
Go further away!

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:23.840
Just be bold and go further.

00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:25.590
Further away.

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:26.850
Is this okay?

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:27.640
Further back.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.900
Further back. Keep going. Further back.

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:34.240
Perfect. Right here.

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.040
Is this right?

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.270
Yes, right there. Good.

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:37.000
Here, right?

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:41.900
Mr. Ding, we're getting started.

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:42.900
Hurry up and do it.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:43.680
Next up,

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:46.160
elephant spin and walk in a straight line.

00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:48.200
Are you ready?

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:48.660
Come on.

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:49.880
Ready?

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:51.270
Go!

00:31:51.960 --> 00:32:00.440
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:01.480
Go!

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:04.110
-Straight line.
-Steady. Move forward.

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:04.590
Straight line.

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:05.480
-Help him. Watch him.
-Keep moving.

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.410
Walk in a straight line. Straight line.

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:07.240
-Xiaoman!
-Xiaoman.

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:09.880
Steady. Steady.

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:12.070
Xiaoman, be careful.

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:13.200
Slow down. Careful.

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:18.350
The ceremony is complete!
No, I mean, the test's complete!

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:19.000
It's done!

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:20.830
Wait, wait. Give me a minute.

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:21.880
A-Are you okay?

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:22.480
I'm okay.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.610
I just need a moment.

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:26.660
Are you sure you're fine?

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:27.380
I'm sure.

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:30.360
I could walk another 50 meters,
no problem at all. Impressive, huh?

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:31.930
Impressive. Go on then.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.550
Didn't you say
you could walk another 50 meters?

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:35.200
Xiaoman!

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:38.240
You passed all the tests!

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:38.920
Great!

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.070
I passed.

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:51.350
[Teaching Building]

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:53.070
Why can't I apply,

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:53.670
Director?

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.160
Wait, on what grounds can't I apply?

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.830
We worked our butts off
training for so long,

00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:59.680
and now you're just telling us no?

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:00.480
Why is that?

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.500
It's good that you've got the passion

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.880
to serve our country.

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:08.830
But regarding your moral character,

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:10.410
the school cannot vouch for you.

00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:11.990
What do I need you to vouch for?

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:13.600
What's wrong with my moral character?

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.660
You want to go push planes for people?

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:17.790
Pushing cars stuck in pits,

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:18.590
50 yuan a time.

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:20.240
If you push planes for people,

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.770
how much do you want to scam?

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:25.070
You were there scamming people
on the dirt road that day, weren't you?

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:26.070
Yet you've got the nerve to ask me

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:28.330
what is wrong with your moral character?

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:30.480
I'm going to fly planes.

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:31.810
Why would I push planes?

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:32.470
Did you see me

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:33.270
taking money?

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.200
I was just helping out, okay?

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.000
Just because you say
my character is flawed,

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000
does that make it true?

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.130
Registration for pilot recruitment
is already closed.

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:42.790
Closed?

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:54.100
So you never intended to
sign me up, did you?

00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:01.280
Sign you up?

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.270
I've already gone easy on you—

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:05.720
teaching you a lesson

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.900
without punishing you, okay?

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.909
Isn't this just fooling us?

00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:23.030
Unbelievable.

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:25.480
Registration ended
and we didn't even know.

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.480
We wasted all that time for nothing.

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:29.710
It wasn't for nothing.

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:31.969
At least it brought us closer together.

00:34:31.969 --> 00:34:32.610
Right?

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.010
It was absolutely for nothing.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.190
Pilot recruitment

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:38.449
at our school has always been exclusive.

00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:41.030
I heard non-cadre children
weren't able to register.

00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.840
In the end, only Director Hou's nephew

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:42.920
got registered.

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:45.469
W-Why didn't you tell us sooner?

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:48.889
Whoever gave you the news
didn't give you the full story?

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:49.630
No.

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:52.630
W-Why didn't you say so earlier?

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:53.290
I...

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.480
I didn't know either.

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.230
When I came in that day,

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:56.840
the flyer was just sitting here.

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:57.700
Who was it then?

00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:59.970
It must have been Xiaodan.

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:01.840
Right, Xiaodan. It was definitely her.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.770
She was here when I came in that day.

00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:05.780
It wasn't me.

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:09.690
Right, it was her, not me.

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:10.510
It wasn't you?

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:12.760
Then why did you make it
look like it was you,

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:13.960
folding it like this,

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:14.760
making it all crinkled,

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:15.450
and saying

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.440
you were repaying me
for delivering that letter?

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:17.320
Did I ask you for anything in return?

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.110
Did I?

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.440
Is this how you repay me?

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:21.510
I-I just thought it suited you.

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:22.320
You know, you in a flight suit...

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.320
Do I need you to tell me that?

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:24.150
Who doesn't know it suits me?

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.510
Look what you've done.

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:25.280
No wonder Xiaodan is always

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.030
giving me the side-eye.

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:27.030
Where is Xiaodan?

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:27.760
She went home.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.220
I'm done for. Look at this.

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.030
It's all messed up!

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:30.920
What a mess!

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:31.520
It's okay.

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:32.960
It's okay. It's okay.

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:33.440
Aren't you going home?

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.190
"Bringing us closer together" my foot.

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:35.480
Look at all this mess we've made!

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:36.230
It's okay.

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:37.800
It's okay. It's okay.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:39.180
I'm going home.

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:40.630
But

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.840
this really isn't my fault.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.440
What is his problem?

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:46.890
Unbelievable.

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:11.000
What do you want?

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:14.800
Well...

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:18.950
You gave me
that pilot recruitment poster, right?

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:21.000
I came to apologize.

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.220
And say thanks.

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.990
Then you haven't thanked me enough.

00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:31.250
Xia Lei's training plan was also from me.

00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:32.430
I knew it.

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:34.630
It didn't look like
it came from just anyone.

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:35.920
It was so professional.

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:38.920
Much better than
what we cobbled together ourselves.

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:42.730
What good did it do?

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:44.550
You didn't get in anyway.

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:46.130
Even though I didn't get in,

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:47.530
I still have to thank you.

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:48.840
I have to thank you

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:51.790
for thinking of me
for every good opportunity.

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.180
Even though you failed
the pilot recruitment,

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:57.550
you succeeded elsewhere.

00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:59.410
I still have to congratulate you.

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:01.000
Elsewhere?

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:03.590
What are you congratulating me for?

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:06.400
Congratulating you on getting that...

00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:09.250
I'm too embarrassed to say it.

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:11.760
What's there to be embarrassed about?

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:14.090
I saw the letter you wrote to
someone else.

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:16.670
Who did I ever write to?
Don't be ridiculous.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.960
That letter to Sun Lulu.

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:21.800
That... That wasn't my letter.

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.660
That was Wang Dongdong's letter.

00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:26.340
But it was your handwriting, wasn't it?

00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:28.270
He asked me to hand-copy it for him.

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:31.230
Seriously, what's your problem?

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:32.890
You copied someone else's letter

W-Who would have known

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:34.880
you had to include the signature?

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:36.280

I need to hurry

It was Wang Dongdong who wanted

that day.

I'm sorry.

It's okay. You were right, actually.

I shouldn't just do anything for money.

Why are you so anxious about making money?

Didn't the factory give you an allowance?

It's not that I'm anxious.
