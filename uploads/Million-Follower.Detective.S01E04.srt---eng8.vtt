WEBVTT

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.125
Yu-yu.

00:00:09.708 --> 00:00:10.833
Yu-yu.

00:00:12.541 --> 00:00:13.708
Yu-yu.

00:00:18.291 --> 00:00:19.541
It's Daddy.

00:00:22.208 --> 00:00:23.666
You've grown so much.

00:00:26.375 --> 00:00:27.208
Here.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.750
This is for you.

00:00:33.083 --> 00:00:34.833
Tell Grandma to buy you some meat.

00:00:36.625 --> 00:00:38.458
Isn't meat your favorite?

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:44.458
Sweetie, eat your meals.

00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.500
Don't upset Grandma.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.041
Okay?

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.208
Daddy will…

00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:54.750
come back for you soon.

00:01:02.416 --> 00:01:03.708
Go back now.

00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.833
You have to grow up safe and sound.

00:01:26.375 --> 00:01:30.000
THE LATE MR. LIN CHUNG-KUN

00:01:30.083 --> 00:01:31.541
Ting-yu, where are you going?

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:33.791
I don't know.

00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:35.291
If I bring it home,

00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:37.208
my grandma will use it for pickling.

00:01:38.375 --> 00:01:40.041
You should wash it first.

00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:42.916
Fuck, that's not the point, okay?

00:01:54.083 --> 00:01:55.750
Fuck, my grandma was right.

00:01:59.083 --> 00:02:00.958
Don't trust a damn thing my dad said.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.375
At least he didn't make you his caregiver.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.833
He died in the hospital.
That was decent of him, right?

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.833
Any inheritance?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.625
-Inheritance, my ass.
-Shit.

00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:17.666
He left a ton of debt.

00:02:24.583 --> 00:02:25.625
Come on, man.

00:02:26.375 --> 00:02:27.208
Why don't we…

00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:30.333
give him a sea burial?

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:32.333
Didn't he say the world was his home?

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.291
Fuck. Are you sure?

00:02:35.375 --> 00:02:36.916
Is this even legal?

00:02:37.541 --> 00:02:39.250
-It's fine.
-Fuck it!

00:02:39.833 --> 00:02:40.916
Feed him to the fishes.

00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:47.083
Hey, fuck! Hey!

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:48.333
-Shit, you idiot!
-Fuck.

00:02:48.416 --> 00:02:50.416
-Fuck.
-Fuck, I ate a dead guy.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.125
Fuck, you ate my dad!

00:02:52.708 --> 00:02:54.875
-Scatter it yourself. Fuck you!
-Idiot.

00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.833
Your dad's all over my clothes.

00:02:57.875 --> 00:02:59.083
It's in my hair!

00:02:59.166 --> 00:03:00.208
Take it!

00:03:01.125 --> 00:03:03.125
Help me brush it off. This is expensive!

00:03:03.208 --> 00:03:04.375
-Your arms.
-My arms.

00:03:04.458 --> 00:03:05.541
It's all over you.

00:03:17.125 --> 00:03:18.000
Yu-Yu.

00:03:19.458 --> 00:03:20.291
Daddy will…

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:22.833
come back for you soon.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.791
Fuck, what's the point of coming back now?

00:04:24.583 --> 00:04:25.625
Hey!

00:04:27.458 --> 00:04:29.041
Is anybody there?

00:04:32.041 --> 00:04:33.541
Anyone?

00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:36.500
Hey!

00:04:37.666 --> 00:04:38.916
Is anyone there?

00:04:45.583 --> 00:04:46.500
DIE

00:05:29.333 --> 00:05:31.083
OCTOBER 4TH

00:05:31.166 --> 00:05:32.000
Chia-jen.

00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:33.500
Chia-jen.

00:05:38.125 --> 00:05:39.666
Li Hsin-ping is off this case.

00:05:40.208 --> 00:05:42.083
Who decided that? Mr. Chieh?

00:05:42.666 --> 00:05:45.833
She altered documents to investigate Yeh,
so I put her on desk duty.

00:05:46.916 --> 00:05:48.875
Her punishment is a written apology.

00:05:57.708 --> 00:05:59.083
Did you release Kuo Ta-fu?

00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:00.791
Chia-jen.

00:06:00.875 --> 00:06:02.666
I detained him.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.208
Another killing happened
during his detention.

00:06:05.291 --> 00:06:07.083
I never said he killed Lin Po-lun.

00:06:07.166 --> 00:06:09.666
Did you detain him
over the influencer murder case?

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.208
Was Lin Po-lun an influencer?

00:06:11.791 --> 00:06:13.666
If anyone's releasing him, it's me.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.666
It's just protocol.
Once time's up, we have to release him.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.958
I don't want to cause
the precinct more trouble.

00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:21.208
Besides, you gave Kuo Ta-fu his alibi.

00:06:23.833 --> 00:06:26.000
The media is on our backs every day.

00:06:26.083 --> 00:06:29.250
-One slip and we're screwed.
-Don't be a cop if that scares you.

00:06:30.166 --> 00:06:31.875
How can I be a cop if I'm screwed?

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.000
-Morning, Mr. Jen.
-Hi.

00:06:37.083 --> 00:06:38.583
You're here too, Mr. Ho?

00:06:39.833 --> 00:06:42.625
We need High-Tech Crime Unit
on this case, too?

00:06:42.708 --> 00:06:44.083
The influencer murder case.

00:06:44.166 --> 00:06:46.541
The Internet and tech go hand in hand.

00:06:46.625 --> 00:06:47.916
So we must…

00:06:49.083 --> 00:06:50.166
Let's talk later.

00:06:59.208 --> 00:07:02.666
The preliminary cause of death
is excessive bleeding from stab wounds.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.750
There's a wound on the right palm,

00:07:05.833 --> 00:07:07.500
and one on the inner right arm.

00:07:07.583 --> 00:07:08.416
Right here.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.333
And four wounds on the abdomen.

00:07:11.875 --> 00:07:13.666
This stab was the fatal wound.

00:07:14.166 --> 00:07:16.625
It punctured the liver
and lodged under the rib.

00:07:17.583 --> 00:07:19.666
Any information about the killer?

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:20.875
Yes.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.875
There was skin and hair
found under his fingernails.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.333
Results from the lab just came in.

00:07:29.416 --> 00:07:31.750
There's no match in the database,

00:07:31.833 --> 00:07:34.125
but it's confirmed to be female.

00:07:35.333 --> 00:07:36.333
Female?

00:07:36.416 --> 00:07:37.250
Yes.

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:41.833
A female suspect
stabbed the victim four times.

00:07:42.375 --> 00:07:43.833
That requires close range.

00:07:44.916 --> 00:07:46.708
He was stabbed four times

00:07:46.791 --> 00:07:49.041
and put up no effective resistance.

00:07:50.458 --> 00:07:53.625
The killer is either trained
or someone he knew.

00:07:56.125 --> 00:07:57.875
I think it's someone he knew.

00:07:58.458 --> 00:08:00.916
Lin Po-lun was killed by stabbing.

00:08:01.458 --> 00:08:02.958
His wounds are low,

00:08:03.041 --> 00:08:04.541
stabbed upward from below.

00:08:04.625 --> 00:08:07.583
This suggests the killer
is likely an average-height female.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.541
Liu Yen-hua drowned
by being held underwater.

00:08:14.083 --> 00:08:15.541
He's 180 centimeters tall.

00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:18.125
It'd be hard for an average woman
to hold him down.

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:22.291
And the body was thrown off Yunong Bridge.

00:08:23.666 --> 00:08:26.125
The railing there
is at least a meter high.

00:08:27.833 --> 00:08:29.083
Considering all this,

00:08:29.166 --> 00:08:31.583
it'd be hard for a woman to do it alone.

00:08:37.375 --> 00:08:39.625
The killer isn't the same person.

00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:02.833
Call Kao Pi.

00:09:06.291 --> 00:09:07.916
Call Chen Chia-jen.

00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:12.625
Fuck!

00:09:20.583 --> 00:09:21.750
Fuck!

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.375
Help!

00:09:25.458 --> 00:09:27.000
Fuck…

00:09:29.625 --> 00:09:31.166
Help!

00:09:44.041 --> 00:09:46.875
I don't need them.
My daughter hates my smoking.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:26.333
Fuck!

00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.250
Is anyone there?

00:11:20.625 --> 00:11:22.125
Anyone?

00:11:25.541 --> 00:11:27.583
Is anyone there?

00:12:14.583 --> 00:12:16.833
ONE YEAR AGO

00:12:16.916 --> 00:12:17.875
Hello, I'm Wei Yen.

00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:18.833
Hi, I'm Wa Tsai.

00:12:18.916 --> 00:12:20.083
Welcome to our channel,

00:12:20.166 --> 00:12:22.000
Wei Fa Yen!

00:12:22.083 --> 00:12:24.000
Today, we're at Raohe Night Market.

00:12:24.083 --> 00:12:25.583
Yes, why are we here?

00:12:25.666 --> 00:12:26.916
It's pouring.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.791
What do you see here?

00:12:28.875 --> 00:12:30.583
Food. Don't they sell food here?

00:12:30.666 --> 00:12:32.250
-No. Think again.
-Right?

00:12:32.333 --> 00:12:33.541
Girls?

00:12:33.625 --> 00:12:35.000
Hey…

00:12:35.083 --> 00:12:36.333
Wet girls!

00:12:36.416 --> 00:12:38.583
-That's what you're thinking, right?
-No!

00:12:38.666 --> 00:12:40.416
-What else?
-Your turn.

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:41.750
-What is it?
-Yeah.

00:12:41.833 --> 00:12:43.958
-What? Dumbass.
-What "yeah"? Wrong!

00:12:44.041 --> 00:12:46.000
-What is it?
-There are a lot here.

00:12:46.083 --> 00:12:47.750
-What's that?
-Put your hand out.

00:12:49.125 --> 00:12:49.958
COCKROACH

00:12:50.041 --> 00:12:52.541
-You idiot!
-Get lost!

00:12:52.625 --> 00:12:54.458
-Hey, are you stupid?
-Damn!

00:12:54.541 --> 00:12:55.958
You're so immature.

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.000
-What are you looking for?
-Fireworks.

00:13:02.083 --> 00:13:04.708
-Fireworks?
-Fireworks on a rainy day?

00:13:04.791 --> 00:13:06.041
-You sure?
-You'll see.

00:13:09.375 --> 00:13:11.791
-I'll take the big one.
-I want sparklers.

00:13:11.875 --> 00:13:13.250
Are you getting sparklers?

00:13:13.333 --> 00:13:14.541
-What the heck?
-Why?

00:13:14.625 --> 00:13:15.458
For up your ass?

00:13:15.541 --> 00:13:18.250
-I'll throw in two small packs for free.
-Nice!

00:13:20.041 --> 00:13:21.000
-Here we go.
-C'mon…

00:13:21.083 --> 00:13:22.666
-Are you filming?
-Yes.

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:23.666
Here we go.

00:13:25.083 --> 00:13:26.208
Is it gonna shoot up?

00:13:26.291 --> 00:13:27.625
-No.
-Hurry…

00:13:31.458 --> 00:13:32.708
Holy crap.

00:13:32.791 --> 00:13:34.000
-Lame.
-That sucked.

00:13:34.083 --> 00:13:35.291
What the heck?

00:13:35.375 --> 00:13:36.458
For fuck's sake.

00:13:36.541 --> 00:13:37.916
One more time.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.208
Just film the gutter.

00:13:39.291 --> 00:13:40.708
Are they sleeping?

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:43.916
Hurry…

00:13:47.666 --> 00:13:49.500
Oh man, this video is lame.

00:13:49.583 --> 00:13:51.083
-What now?
-Don't film it, then.

00:13:51.166 --> 00:13:52.666
What about these two packs?

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:54.625
I told you to blast it up your ass.

00:13:54.708 --> 00:13:55.541
That's trashy.

00:13:55.625 --> 00:13:58.250
No, listen.
It'll look sick on camera. Trust me.

00:13:58.333 --> 00:14:00.041
-I'm not feeling it. Let's go.
-No?

00:14:00.125 --> 00:14:01.041
Fuck.

00:14:06.583 --> 00:14:08.166
Why the fuck did you do that?

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:09.833
-You idiot.
-It's not broken.

00:14:09.916 --> 00:14:11.250
-Hey.
-It's not broken.

00:14:11.333 --> 00:14:12.833
Hey, I got an idea…

00:14:12.916 --> 00:14:14.083
I have a sick idea.

00:14:15.125 --> 00:14:15.958
What?

00:14:16.625 --> 00:14:18.208
Shit.

00:14:18.291 --> 00:14:19.916
-Fuck!
-Fuck!

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.583
Your aim is too good!

00:14:21.666 --> 00:14:23.666
-I'll blow your head off.
-Stop it!

00:14:27.083 --> 00:14:28.291
Shit.

00:14:28.375 --> 00:14:29.500
What the heck?

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:35.750
-Hey, slow down…
-Get his face…

00:14:35.833 --> 00:14:37.250
I can't get him…

00:14:37.333 --> 00:14:39.958
Fuck! Hurry, get past him. Quick!

00:14:40.041 --> 00:14:41.625
Go faster!

00:14:42.833 --> 00:14:45.583
-Get his face! Aim for his tires.
-Fuck you!

00:14:46.666 --> 00:14:48.000
-So aggressive?
-Get him.

00:14:48.083 --> 00:14:49.333
Light the big one.

00:14:49.416 --> 00:14:51.416
Get his head!

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.083
-Shit…
-Hey! Fuck you!

00:14:53.166 --> 00:14:55.208
Wait, shit.

00:14:55.291 --> 00:14:57.083
Can we even post this on UTurn?

00:14:57.166 --> 00:14:58.625
Don't overthink it.

00:14:58.708 --> 00:15:00.708
Fuck, this is really dangerous!

00:15:12.583 --> 00:15:13.416
Fuck.

00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:18.833
Shit. That's not good.

00:15:19.833 --> 00:15:21.458
-What do we do?
-What now?

00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.750
-Let's go.
-Do we call the police?

00:15:26.833 --> 00:15:28.791
-Hey, let's go. Come on.
-What the heck?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.416
-Hey, Ting-yu, come on.
-Let's go!

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:33.958
-Come on!
-Let's go.

00:15:34.541 --> 00:15:35.625
Let's go!

00:16:00.458 --> 00:16:04.166
-Fuck you! Who said to light the big one?
-Fuck! What's wrong with you?

00:16:04.833 --> 00:16:06.041
Whose idea was it?

00:16:06.125 --> 00:16:07.000
Was it my idea?

00:16:07.083 --> 00:16:09.583
-You shouldn't have bought them.
-It's my fault?

00:16:09.666 --> 00:16:11.875
-Who else? Why are you yelling?
-Enough.

00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:13.541
You think you're innocent?

00:16:13.625 --> 00:16:14.666
-Enough.
-Fuck you!

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:17.000
-Stop it.
-Go home if you're so scared!

00:16:17.583 --> 00:16:19.000
What's the point of arguing?

00:16:19.083 --> 00:16:19.958
Fuck…

00:16:25.916 --> 00:16:26.958
What do we do now?

00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.458
Should we go back and check?

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:42.375
-They're fine, right?
-Are they?

00:16:45.125 --> 00:16:46.208
I don't know.

00:16:52.916 --> 00:16:53.750
Fuck!

00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:17.375
For a cybercrime
where the victims are influencers,

00:17:17.458 --> 00:17:19.541
we rely on tech now more than ever.

00:17:19.625 --> 00:17:21.333
Chia-jen, I think for this case,

00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:23.583
the High-Tech Crime Unit
should take charge.

00:17:24.291 --> 00:17:27.041
Mr. Chieh assigned Li Hsin-ping to me.

00:17:27.583 --> 00:17:30.083
If I need anything,
I'll contact her myself.

00:17:30.166 --> 00:17:31.000
So you told her

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:34.083
to look into Yeh Pin-hsuan?

00:17:34.166 --> 00:17:36.000
Do I report to you now?

00:17:38.166 --> 00:17:39.458
No, Chia-jen.

00:17:39.541 --> 00:17:41.125
Li Hsin-ping is a rookie.

00:17:41.208 --> 00:17:43.541
She's too inexperienced
and impulsive for this.

00:17:43.625 --> 00:17:45.791
And you know nothing
about the online world.

00:17:45.875 --> 00:17:48.583
Don't think that she's just a woman
in a mask. Online--

00:17:48.666 --> 00:17:51.041
Anyone could be Witch Baba.

00:17:51.791 --> 00:17:53.125
Of course I know that.

00:17:56.791 --> 00:17:58.416
Unless we narrow down the range,

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.333
this lead's completely useless.

00:18:00.416 --> 00:18:02.333
Listen, we've already started.

00:18:16.708 --> 00:18:17.833
MISSED CALL: TING-YU

00:18:17.916 --> 00:18:19.583
THIS IS TING-YU, YO! YO!

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:54.375
XIMEN RED HOUSE

00:18:54.458 --> 00:18:56.958
XIMEN RED HOUSE

00:19:21.291 --> 00:19:22.125
Hey!

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:23.750
Where's Lin Ting-yu?

00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:26.333
I don't know.

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:28.875
I'm talking about your friend, Ting-yu.

00:19:34.333 --> 00:19:35.166
Here.

00:19:37.375 --> 00:19:38.708
He sent it to me, too.

00:19:39.208 --> 00:19:40.375
When did he send it?

00:19:40.458 --> 00:19:42.916
He disappeared
after sending this photo yesterday.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.416
Around 2:30 a.m.

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:49.375
Is it from this angle?

00:20:12.833 --> 00:20:14.000
Is it here?

00:20:21.666 --> 00:20:22.916
What's this?

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.333
Ting-yu's blood.

00:20:26.875 --> 00:20:27.875
Is this blood?

00:20:42.916 --> 00:20:43.750
Hey.

00:20:45.333 --> 00:20:48.791
LETTER OF REPENTANCE NAME: LI HSIN-PING

00:21:00.041 --> 00:21:00.916
Hello, Mr. Jen?

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.458
Li Hsin-ping,
pull the surveillance footage now.

00:21:04.125 --> 00:21:05.458
Mr. Jen,

00:21:05.541 --> 00:21:07.791
I've been pulled from the case.

00:21:07.875 --> 00:21:10.291
-Mr. Ho said if I keep--
-Lin Ting-yu is missing.

00:21:13.958 --> 00:21:15.083
-What?
-Morning.

00:21:15.166 --> 00:21:16.000
Morning.

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.291
Kao Pi and I are in Ximending.

00:21:18.375 --> 00:21:20.791
-You mean…
-We found the place he was last seen.

00:21:21.375 --> 00:21:23.500
My initial read is that he was kidnapped.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.458
There's blood at the scene.

00:21:29.875 --> 00:21:31.500
Blood?

00:21:31.583 --> 00:21:33.000
Yes, Ting-yu's missing.

00:21:33.083 --> 00:21:36.125
There's blood on the ground.
It's probably his.

00:21:38.708 --> 00:21:41.041
There are surveillance cameras nearby.

00:21:41.125 --> 00:21:42.083
I need your help.

00:21:48.875 --> 00:21:49.708
Okay.

00:21:50.375 --> 00:21:51.708
What do you need me to do?

00:21:51.791 --> 00:21:54.291
Check for any suspicious people
or vehicles…

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:58.625
between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m.

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:00.666
Chengdu St.,

00:22:01.166 --> 00:22:02.000
Lane 10.

00:22:02.666 --> 00:22:03.500
Yeah.

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:08.583
Yes.

00:22:19.291 --> 00:22:22.291
LI HSIN-PING
HIGH TECHNOLOGY CRIME INVESTIGATION UNIT

00:22:25.916 --> 00:22:28.000
Obelisk reversed.

00:22:28.083 --> 00:22:30.333
Orient Express upright.

00:22:30.416 --> 00:22:32.291
Amazonia reversed.

00:22:33.291 --> 00:22:34.666
In the future…

00:22:35.458 --> 00:22:39.416
In the future,
someone will be stabbed to death.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:40.875
Sorry about that.

00:23:14.333 --> 00:23:16.125
Help!

00:23:28.583 --> 00:23:30.708
Between 2:30 a.m. and 3 a.m.,

00:23:30.791 --> 00:23:33.458
seven vehicles went in and out
of that alley.

00:23:35.541 --> 00:23:37.833
One of them was reported stolen last week.

00:23:38.458 --> 00:23:39.958
Follow the stolen car.

00:23:41.291 --> 00:23:42.708
Ting-yu's not answering.

00:23:43.375 --> 00:23:44.208
Keep trying.

00:23:46.125 --> 00:23:47.541
I'm on Zhonghua Road now.

00:23:48.416 --> 00:23:50.375
It went north from Zhonghua Road…

00:23:52.291 --> 00:23:54.125
got on the expressway on Civic Blvd,

00:23:54.833 --> 00:23:57.708
and then exited in Nangang
heading toward Xizhi.

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:51.000
And went on Huandong Blvd.

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:55.750
It last appeared

00:24:55.833 --> 00:24:59.041
-at No. 20 Jiadong St., Xizhi District.
-Okay.

00:24:59.125 --> 00:25:01.083
Don't hang up…

00:25:01.666 --> 00:25:03.291
Can you send it to me?

00:25:04.166 --> 00:25:05.000
Sending it now.

00:26:51.833 --> 00:26:54.083
Ting-yu!

00:27:04.958 --> 00:27:06.458
Is Ting-yu really here?

00:27:06.541 --> 00:27:07.375
Shush.

00:27:07.875 --> 00:27:09.250
Is Ting-yu going to die?

00:27:09.833 --> 00:27:11.166
How do you know he's here?

00:27:14.375 --> 00:27:15.291
Can you hear that?

00:27:16.541 --> 00:27:17.708
What's that sound?

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:15.083
Before he died…

00:28:18.125 --> 00:28:20.500
All her predictions
follow the same pattern.

00:28:21.625 --> 00:28:23.625
She orchestrated the whole thing.

00:28:25.416 --> 00:28:27.166
Suddenly, someone covered my mouth.

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:30.166
He was locked in that trunk,
just like I was.

00:28:32.166 --> 00:28:33.250
UTURN NOTIFICATION

00:28:34.916 --> 00:28:35.833
Hi, guys.

00:28:36.875 --> 00:28:38.250
I'm in the hospital.

00:28:40.208 --> 00:28:42.791
Witch Baba's prediction almost came true.

00:28:44.583 --> 00:28:48.166
I'm the victim
of Witch Baba's stabbing prediction.

00:28:50.625 --> 00:28:51.791
Last night,

00:28:52.291 --> 00:28:53.250
late at night…

00:28:56.041 --> 00:28:57.833
I was in an alley by the Red House.

00:29:02.166 --> 00:29:04.083
Suddenly, someone covered my mouth.

00:29:06.083 --> 00:29:07.708
Then my back hurt like hell.

00:29:14.791 --> 00:29:16.041
And I ended up with this.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.166
I don't know what was on that cloth.

00:29:27.125 --> 00:29:29.291
It smelled weird, and I passed out.

00:29:33.208 --> 00:29:34.666
I didn't see the perpetrator.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.583
Later, I woke up in a car trunk…

00:29:45.583 --> 00:29:47.166
and I was bleeding so much.

00:29:48.583 --> 00:29:49.875
Luckily, in the end…

00:29:51.791 --> 00:29:53.416
Officer Chen Chia-jen saved me.

00:30:04.416 --> 00:30:06.541
I also found this in the trunk.

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:23.833
This is Wa Tsai's earring.

00:30:31.541 --> 00:30:33.083
Before he died,

00:30:33.875 --> 00:30:36.458
he was locked in that trunk,
just like I was.

00:30:47.125 --> 00:30:49.250
Now I know Witch Baba's method.

00:30:51.333 --> 00:30:54.666
She locked me and Wa Tsai
in the trunk to die.

00:30:55.166 --> 00:30:57.041
After her prediction spreads,

00:30:57.125 --> 00:30:59.333
she'd dump our bodies…

00:31:00.666 --> 00:31:02.583
and say her prediction came true.

00:31:03.791 --> 00:31:06.208
All her predictions
follow the same pattern.

00:31:06.291 --> 00:31:08.708
She orchestrated the whole thing.

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:17.250
Hello, we're Egg Water River.

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:19.208
What are we discussing today?

00:31:19.291 --> 00:31:22.500
The popular urban legend, "Witch Baba".

00:31:22.583 --> 00:31:23.416
That's right.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:25.208
The name Witch Baba

00:31:25.291 --> 00:31:27.333
came from a Bulgarian psychic

00:31:27.416 --> 00:31:29.083
named Baba Vanga.

00:31:29.166 --> 00:31:31.166
The prediction cards she uses

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:33.125
are just an ordinary board game.

00:31:33.208 --> 00:31:34.958
Just an ordinary board game.

00:31:35.041 --> 00:31:37.208
You're always putting on a show.

00:31:37.916 --> 00:31:38.916
Would you please…

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.625
remove your mask and show yourself?

00:31:40.708 --> 00:31:43.083
Most fortune telling, or predictions,

00:31:43.166 --> 00:31:45.000
rely on psychological illusions.

00:31:45.083 --> 00:31:47.250
-Right.
-Witch Baba's method is more brutal.

00:31:47.333 --> 00:31:50.291
She's just waiting
for the "post hoc fallacy" to happen.

00:31:50.375 --> 00:31:52.250
"Post hoc fallacy"? What's that?

00:31:52.333 --> 00:31:53.916
Hey, Hippo, let me tell you.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.375
It's a coincidence!

00:31:55.458 --> 00:31:57.375
-Coincidence!
-It's a coincidence.

00:31:57.458 --> 00:31:59.583
I think this series of influencer killings

00:31:59.666 --> 00:32:01.500
was orchestrated by Witch Baba.

00:32:01.583 --> 00:32:03.916
From Wa Tsai, Ting-yu, to Lin Po-lun,

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.375
and she threatened Wei Yen.

00:32:06.458 --> 00:32:08.000
That's why he fired the gun.

00:32:08.083 --> 00:32:10.500
When Wei Yen opened fire
he didn't have a camera.

00:32:10.583 --> 00:32:11.583
No one was filming.

00:32:11.666 --> 00:32:13.166
People say he did it for show.

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:15.333
How is it a show if no one's filming?

00:32:16.791 --> 00:32:19.583
"Post hoc fallacy" is a logical error.

00:32:19.666 --> 00:32:20.583
Think about it.

00:32:20.666 --> 00:32:23.458
Like lottery news, traffic accident news,

00:32:23.541 --> 00:32:24.791
or earthquake news.

00:32:24.875 --> 00:32:26.541
Aren't there accidents every day?

00:32:26.625 --> 00:32:27.833
There are!

00:32:27.916 --> 00:32:29.791
When does Taiwan not have an earthquake?

00:32:29.875 --> 00:32:31.583
We get rocked every three months.

00:32:31.666 --> 00:32:33.666
So Witch Baba's videos

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:35.666
are completely random.

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:36.750
This is hilarious.

00:32:37.458 --> 00:32:39.750
I know why you won't take off your mask.

00:32:40.583 --> 00:32:41.625
Because…

00:32:41.708 --> 00:32:43.916
Because you're hideous. Shame!

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.333
Sometimes,

00:32:45.416 --> 00:32:47.125
-she uploads every few days.
-Yeah.

00:32:47.208 --> 00:32:49.625
Sometimes, she doesn't upload for months.

00:32:49.708 --> 00:32:51.208
-What's she waiting for?
-What?

00:32:51.291 --> 00:32:52.500
For something to happen.

00:32:52.583 --> 00:32:53.541
Exactly, she waits…

00:32:53.625 --> 00:32:55.833
I don't know why
she's targeting us influencers.

00:32:55.916 --> 00:32:58.625
We're normal people.
Being influencers is just our job.

00:32:58.708 --> 00:33:01.791
But nothing can extinguish
our passion for this job.

00:33:01.875 --> 00:33:02.958
-Only recently
-Yes.

00:33:03.041 --> 00:33:06.083
has she started
posting predictions frequently.

00:33:06.166 --> 00:33:07.916
Just like Ting-yu said,

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.958
she wants to make
her own prediction come true.

00:33:11.041 --> 00:33:12.041
I'm warning you.

00:33:12.125 --> 00:33:14.166
If you touch my friends, I'll find you.

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:16.208
You're gonna be the next victim.

00:33:16.291 --> 00:33:18.875
LITTLE EGG ROASTS DUCK EGG

00:33:18.958 --> 00:33:21.583
Witch Baba could be anyone.

00:33:22.125 --> 00:33:23.375
No matter who you are,

00:33:23.875 --> 00:33:26.000
I'm sure you make a living online, too.

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:28.541
Please turn yourself in.

00:33:28.625 --> 00:33:30.291
Stop hurting the community.

00:33:30.791 --> 00:33:32.125
Stop killing.

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.291
-KEEP ACTING
-TYPICAL INFLUENCER

00:33:36.375 --> 00:33:38.583
-CUT THE CRAP
-YOU'RE JUST WASTING TIME

00:33:59.833 --> 00:34:02.375
Hey, Mr. Jen. Were you looking for me?

00:34:02.458 --> 00:34:04.458
Yes, I'm taking you to meet someone.

00:34:04.541 --> 00:34:05.375
Thank you.

00:34:09.541 --> 00:34:10.625
Where are we going?

00:34:12.416 --> 00:34:14.500
EMERGENCY

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:18.916
Come in.

00:34:23.041 --> 00:34:25.250
Is that my hero?

00:34:26.166 --> 00:34:28.333
Have you brought me something fancy?

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:31.208
Ding Shang Fried Rice.

00:34:31.291 --> 00:34:32.208
It tastes great.

00:34:32.291 --> 00:34:33.958
-Fried rice?
-Yes.

00:34:34.041 --> 00:34:35.541
How could you?

00:34:36.166 --> 00:34:37.625
You're recovering well.

00:34:37.708 --> 00:34:39.166
Are you recording?

00:34:40.583 --> 00:34:42.166
If you had come a little later,

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:43.833
you wouldn't see me anymore.

00:34:44.541 --> 00:34:46.750
I wouldn't see a loser.

00:34:47.791 --> 00:34:50.333
Still a loser with a million followers.

00:34:51.291 --> 00:34:52.125
Who is she?

00:34:56.125 --> 00:34:56.958
Hello.

00:34:57.041 --> 00:35:00.333
I'm Li Hsin-ping,
from the Taipei City High-Tech Crime Unit.

00:35:00.833 --> 00:35:02.916
-Hello.
-I watch your…

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:05.791
What's Up Yo! Yo! channel.

00:35:06.458 --> 00:35:07.291
Thank you.

00:35:08.458 --> 00:35:09.625
I have a few questions.

00:35:09.708 --> 00:35:12.791
-I've already said everything.
-Is this your kidnapper?

00:35:12.875 --> 00:35:15.291
-No idea. I didn't see anyone.
-Just take a look.

00:35:18.125 --> 00:35:19.166
I don't know.

00:35:22.833 --> 00:35:24.666
Was the perpetrator male or female?

00:35:33.916 --> 00:35:34.916
Probably…

00:35:36.791 --> 00:35:38.041
not female…

00:35:39.041 --> 00:35:39.875
I think.

00:35:39.958 --> 00:35:41.000
Are you sure?

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:42.333
Think again.

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:45.541
I don't know. I didn't see anyone.

00:35:46.125 --> 00:35:48.791
Have you guys offended anyone lately?

00:35:48.875 --> 00:35:50.541
-Us?
-Yes.

00:35:50.625 --> 00:35:52.750
You, Wa Tsai, and Wei Yen.

00:35:52.833 --> 00:35:54.791
Didn't you often film together?

00:35:54.875 --> 00:35:57.458
You punks probably offend people
quite often, right?

00:35:58.416 --> 00:36:00.291
Hey, what's she talking about?

00:36:01.541 --> 00:36:05.000
I also think that the perpetrator
is targeting you guys.

00:36:05.083 --> 00:36:06.833
What about Lin Po-lun?

00:36:06.916 --> 00:36:08.375
I don't know him at all.

00:36:08.458 --> 00:36:10.875
It's just random killing.

00:36:12.333 --> 00:36:13.583
What about Yeh Pin-hsuan?

00:36:13.666 --> 00:36:14.791
Who is she?

00:36:22.041 --> 00:36:22.916
I don't know her.

00:36:24.583 --> 00:36:27.541
We suspect that she killed Lin Po-lun.

00:36:27.625 --> 00:36:29.041
But right now,

00:36:29.125 --> 00:36:30.333
we don't have a motive.

00:36:31.208 --> 00:36:33.375
But we're sure Liu Yen-hua

00:36:33.916 --> 00:36:35.125
was killed by a man.

00:36:36.541 --> 00:36:40.000
But she was at both crime scenes

00:36:40.083 --> 00:36:42.166
and in RS E-Sports.

00:36:42.875 --> 00:36:44.958
Post hoc fallacy.

00:36:46.458 --> 00:36:47.666
Coincidence.

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:49.333
You learned that online?

00:36:50.791 --> 00:36:51.625
Yes.

00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:56.500
Check your phone.

00:36:58.875 --> 00:36:59.708
What?

00:37:02.291 --> 00:37:03.375
Hey, what's going on?

00:37:03.875 --> 00:37:05.041
Are you leaving?

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.041
Why?

00:37:07.125 --> 00:37:08.666
I don't know.

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:16.000
She locked me and Wa Tsai
in the trunk to die.

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.375
After her prediction spreads,

00:37:18.458 --> 00:37:20.541
she'd dump our bodies,

00:37:20.625 --> 00:37:22.333
then say her prediction came true.

00:37:25.541 --> 00:37:27.958
All her predictions
follow the same pattern.

00:37:28.041 --> 00:37:30.166
She orchestrated the whole thing.

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:38.500
Witch Baba?

00:37:46.625 --> 00:37:48.375

00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:10.333
Sir.

00:39:12.625 --> 00:39:14.041
About Yeh Pin-hsuan,

00:39:14.125 --> 00:39:15.208
it's my fault.

00:39:15.291 --> 00:39:16.125
I misspoke,

00:39:16.208 --> 00:39:18.833
but I didn't do it on purpose. I'm sorry.

00:39:20.875 --> 00:39:21.750
She was with you.

00:39:26.291 --> 00:39:27.666
Chia-jen, I've warned you.

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:29.875
The online world isn't that simple.

00:39:29.958 --> 00:39:31.375
What's going on?

00:39:32.416 --> 00:39:35.000

Also, Ho Chen-wei,

00:39:46.416 --> 00:39:49.083
your High-Tech Crime Unit
is responsible for this too.

00:39:49.166 --> 00:39:50.000
Yes.

00:40:07.625 --> 00:40:09.000
What's going on now?

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:18.416
Witch Baba uploaded a new video.

00:40:25.416 --> 00:40:26.833
WITCH BABA

00:40:27.333 --> 00:40:28.750
Hello, everyone.

00:40:28.833 --> 00:40:30.458
I'm Witch Baba.

00:40:30.541 --> 00:40:33.125
Today is October 5th.

00:40:33.208 --> 00:40:36.708
Last time, I predicted that someone
would be stabbed to death.

00:40:36.791 --> 00:40:39.250
And it came true.

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:43.041
We're still going to draw
the next prediction today.

00:40:45.458 --> 00:40:47.541
Weather Rada upright.

00:40:50.583 --> 00:40:53.083
London Big Ben reversed.

00:40:54.583 --> 00:40:56.708
Alien reversed.

00:40:58.083 --> 00:40:59.458
In the future,

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.666
someone will fall from a footbridge
and die.

00:45:09.625 --> 00:45:14.625
