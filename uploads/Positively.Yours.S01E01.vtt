Why wouldn't I?

00:08:50.505 --> 00:08:52.838

Yeah, the odds are definitely high.

But what does he look like? Handsome?

00:09:53.605 --> 00:09:56.272
I don't know. He had sunglasses on,
couldn't really see.

That's because they tried

Sir, give me a bottle of Try...

00:11:34.038 --> 00:11:35.905
No, no, make it two bottles, please.

00:11:38.972 --> 00:11:40.138
Cheers.

00:11:40.138 --> 00:11:43.572
- You're going down tonight.
- I'm gonna beat you today.

00:11:45.605 --> 00:11:48.105
- No sipping!
- I finished it all.

00:11:52.572 --> 00:11:54.905
Sad?

00:11:55.621 --> 00:11:57.072
Huh? I'm not drunk.

00:11:57.072 --> 00:11:59.172
- You know, I'm usually super cool, right?
- It's not that, seriously.

00:11:59.172 --> 00:12:01.338
- Three, six, nine. Three, six, nine!
- Bang!

00:12:06.038 --> 00:12:08.105
Drunk?

00:12:08.105 --> 00:12:10.072
Wake up. Time for round two.

00:12:10.072 --> 00:12:12.805
Sir, another bottle of Try here, please.

00:12:12.805 --> 00:12:16.338
So then, he suddenly disappeared?

00:12:21.738 --> 00:12:23.505
Got it for now.

00:12:26.305 --> 00:12:28.205
Oh, my head...

00:12:29.338 --> 00:12:30.805
See?

00:12:30.805 --> 00:12:32.872
I told you I should go keep an eye on him.

00:12:32.872 --> 00:12:34.872
You know that blind date the other day?

00:12:34.872 --> 00:12:38.605
He set Chae Yeon's childhood pictures
as his phone wallpaper

00:12:38.605 --> 00:12:42.238
and even pretended to be her father.

00:12:42.238 --> 00:12:43.405
Oh, my head...

00:12:43.405 --> 00:12:45.538
I had to explain that mess...

00:12:45.538 --> 00:12:49.472
He's that desperate not to get married,
so let's give him some time.

00:12:49.472 --> 00:12:52.138
You calm down too.
Jeong Eum will be here soon.

00:12:52.138 --> 00:12:54.005
How could I possibly calm down?

00:12:54.005 --> 00:12:55.505
Do you think I don't know

00:12:55.505 --> 00:12:57.838
how the board's been itching to tear

00:12:57.838 --> 00:13:00.972
Du Jun apart ever since your sabbatical?

00:13:00.972 --> 00:13:03.138
- I'll try to handle that...
- Oh, dear.

00:13:03.138 --> 00:13:04.872
How exactly?

00:13:04.872 --> 00:13:08.805
Like last time, when everything blew up,
and you only showed up to clean the mess?

00:13:08.805 --> 00:13:12.038
He's not acting this way for no reason.

00:13:12.038 --> 00:13:15.338
It's that pointless
sense of responsibility of his.

00:13:15.338 --> 00:13:17.938
From what I see, Jeong Eum must be

00:13:17.938 --> 00:13:19.672
pressuring Du Jun somehow...

00:13:19.672 --> 00:13:21.438
Pressuring him how?

00:13:24.038 --> 00:13:26.172
Oh? You're here.

00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:28.138
Sit here.

00:13:28.138 --> 00:13:30.172
Se Hyeon has plans?

00:13:30.172 --> 00:13:31.172
Yes.

00:13:31.172 --> 00:13:32.538
Oh.

00:13:32.538 --> 00:13:34.338
Let's continue the conversation
you two were having.

00:13:34.338 --> 00:13:36.133
I love talking about myself.

00:13:36.133 --> 00:13:37.976
Oh.

00:13:38.672 --> 00:13:40.505
Well, since Du Jun

00:13:40.505 --> 00:13:45.005
keeps avoiding blind dates
and refuses to get married...

00:13:45.005 --> 00:13:47.838
Is marriage really necessary?

00:13:47.838 --> 00:13:50.872
It's not like marriage guarantees
you won't end up alone.

00:13:50.872 --> 00:13:52.605
Just like me.

00:13:58.405 --> 00:14:00.138
Excuse me for a moment.

00:14:01.438 --> 00:14:04.438
Yeah, I'm with my in-laws.

00:14:05.505 --> 00:14:07.572
Mr. Lee?

00:14:09.205 --> 00:14:12.105
Has that punk lost his mind?

00:14:15.105 --> 00:14:16.472
Tell him to get out.

00:14:16.472 --> 00:14:19.572
Show him what happens
when he stabs me in the back.

00:14:24.672 --> 00:14:25.905
Sorry, it's work-related.

00:14:25.905 --> 00:14:28.838
Oh, yes.

00:14:29.472 --> 00:14:31.172
It's okay.

00:15:01.705 --> 00:15:04.738
But seriously, why don't you
want to get married?

00:15:04.738 --> 00:15:06.072
I can't.

00:15:06.072 --> 00:15:08.372
I said I can't do it.

00:15:09.784 --> 00:15:13.336
No! No!

00:15:14.138 --> 00:15:17.938
How could I dare think of marriage,
after destroying a family with my own hands?

Fourteen bottles of beer?

00:15:59.238 --> 00:16:03.005
See? She didn't become
the youngest manager for nothing.

00:16:03.005 --> 00:16:04.972
What, did she even brag about proving it?

00:16:04.972 --> 00:16:06.872
Even without that, the Germany slot
is obviously Manager Jang's.

00:16:06.872 --> 00:16:07.905
Germany?

00:16:07.905 --> 00:16:09.272
Guess you haven't heard, Se Hyeon.

00:16:09.272 --> 00:16:12.572
Every three years, the company
picks top-performing employees

00:16:12.572 --> 00:16:14.005
for a study program in Germany.

00:16:14.005 --> 00:16:16.672
But competition's insane these days,

00:16:16.672 --> 00:16:18.438
so rumor is they're even
scoring creativity now.

00:16:18.438 --> 00:16:20.772
Still, who could possibly beat Manager Jang?

00:16:20.772 --> 00:16:25.405
I've never seen anyone so relentless
in new product development.

00:16:25.405 --> 00:16:28.638
She heard minerals were
used in medicine and cosmetics

00:16:28.638 --> 00:16:31.605
and went mining for ones
that could work in beer.

00:16:31.605 --> 00:16:34.405
That's not all. She planned
limited-edition beer with rare fruit

00:16:34.405 --> 00:16:35.805
and went trekking through jungles.

00:16:35.805 --> 00:16:37.772
Wow, is she some kind of Tarzan?

00:16:37.772 --> 00:16:40.872
Last month, for some special Himalayan yeast,

00:16:40.872 --> 00:16:42.005
she was scaling ice walls...

00:16:42.005 --> 00:16:44.205
Manager Nam In Nam?

00:16:44.205 --> 00:16:45.638
You went around calling me
Tarzan again, didn't you?

00:16:45.638 --> 00:16:48.672
Because of you, there are all
these weird rumors going around.

00:16:48.672 --> 00:16:50.305
Did I say anything that wasn't true?

00:16:50.305 --> 00:16:52.505
Just exaggerated a tiny bit.

00:16:52.505 --> 00:16:55.372
A tiny bit? About...

00:16:55.372 --> 00:16:56.838
- 70%?
- Assistant Manager Choi.

00:16:56.838 --> 00:16:58.138
It just shows Manager Jang's

00:16:58.138 --> 00:17:00.505
unmatched role
in our New Product Development Team.

00:17:00.505 --> 00:17:02.738
Our ace.

00:17:02.738 --> 00:17:04.773
Absolutely, you are my role model.

00:17:04.773 --> 00:17:06.437
I'm telling the truth.

00:17:06.437 --> 00:17:09.038
- Hey quiet now.
- Shut it.

00:17:09.038 --> 00:17:11.238
What? Why did everyone
suddenly stop laughing?

00:17:11.238 --> 00:17:12.805
Conference room. Now.

00:17:12.805 --> 00:17:14.805
No ideas at all?

00:17:14.805 --> 00:17:16.005
You, intern.

00:17:16.005 --> 00:17:18.238
- Yes?
- Got any brilliant ideas?

00:17:18.238 --> 00:17:20.472
They say Gen Z these days
come up with fresh, creative ideas,

00:17:20.472 --> 00:17:23.305
but I guess not all of them do.

00:17:25.505 --> 00:17:27.605
You must've learned something in a month.

00:17:27.605 --> 00:17:29.305
Didn't your supervisor teach you anything?

00:17:29.305 --> 00:17:30.805
Just scold me already.

00:17:30.805 --> 00:17:32.505
I think that's what you wanted to say to me.

00:17:32.505 --> 00:17:34.972
Fine, you talk well.

00:17:34.972 --> 00:17:36.338
Now, show me what you've got.

00:17:36.338 --> 00:17:38.838
Set an example as a senior.

00:17:40.372 --> 00:17:43.872
You think you can just sit back
now that Germany's basically a done deal?

00:17:43.872 --> 00:17:48.672
I suppose that's smarter than getting
involved and docking your own score.

00:17:52.838 --> 00:17:55.072
So, I just need to bring it
by the next meeting, right?

00:17:55.072 --> 00:17:58.972
A groundbreaking idea to boost beer sales?

00:18:01.638 --> 00:18:03.572
So, you went head-to-head
with your boss again?

00:18:03.572 --> 00:18:07.705
I worked all weekend because of her,
and now she's messing with my junior.

00:18:07.705 --> 00:18:09.938
Why's she always obsessed
with taking me down?

00:18:09.938 --> 00:18:14.038
Because a junior who's better
than her keeps threatening her turf.

00:18:14.038 --> 00:18:16.905
She blames you for last year's
failed promotion, right?

00:18:16.905 --> 00:18:18.272
No, that was

00:18:18.272 --> 00:18:21.572
because she tried to claim
our team's all-nighter as her work.

00:18:21.572 --> 00:18:24.905
Anyway, I stormed out in anger earlier,

00:18:24.905 --> 00:18:28.372
but where do I find such an idea?

00:18:28.372 --> 00:18:30.272

Did Mi Ran say that?

00:20:33.805 --> 00:20:36.372
No, I was hoping the three of us
could grab a drink after so long.

00:20:36.372 --> 00:20:38.572
But she said you have a very important date.

No, it's not that. Not at all.

I thought maybe you'd finally
started thinking about marriage.

00:20:46.338 --> 00:20:48.272
You know how my parents are.

00:20:48.272 --> 00:20:50.272

You still think your parents' divorce
was your fault?

So, why would anyone marry without love?

00:21:16.205 --> 00:21:19.838
Even if it hadn't been Dad's affair,
they would've divorced anyway.

00:21:19.838 --> 00:21:21.805
They weren't compatible.

You remember the commercial
building project I mentioned before?

I was thinking of doing that
together with Manager Song.

00:22:56.238 --> 00:22:57.905
I believe I addressed that last time.

There's already a qualified person for that.

I'll reassign the lead.

00:53:44.805 --> 00:53:47.072
Could he be married?

00:53:47.072 --> 00:53:50.438
Ah, I'm going crazy, I'm losing my mind!

00:53:50.438 --> 00:53:52.038
Manager Jang.

00:53:52.038 --> 00:53:53.872
Manager Jang.

00:53:53.872 --> 00:53:56.572
They say your proposal got approved.

00:53:56.572 --> 00:53:59.372
I mean, that logo placement!

00:53:59.372 --> 00:54:01.372
According to Manager Jang,
raising the logo placement on the glass

00:54:01.372 --> 00:54:04.305
increases the amount of beer and soju poured.

00:54:04.305 --> 00:54:07.538
If sales increase,
management won't object much.

00:54:07.538 --> 00:54:10.372
First, we'll produce a small batch
with the new print,

00:54:10.372 --> 00:54:13.413
and distribute 50 glasses to each partner.

00:54:13.413 --> 00:54:15.205
Everyone, get ready.

00:54:16.738 --> 00:54:19.838
Right, Manager Jang,
finalize the proposal details,

00:54:19.838 --> 00:54:22.005
including estimated development costs,
and submit it by next week.

00:54:22.005 --> 00:54:23.072
Talk to the procurement team,

00:54:23.072 --> 00:54:25.102
and get the schedules
from the beer glass manufacturer

00:54:25.102 --> 00:54:26.172
and the printing company too.

00:54:26.172 --> 00:54:27.438
Yes.

00:54:27.438 --> 00:54:28.605
We'll help too.

00:54:28.605 --> 00:54:29.972
Right, just tell us what to do.

00:54:29.972 --> 00:54:31.072
Thank you.

00:54:31.072 --> 00:54:32.805
Congratulations.

00:54:40.205 --> 00:54:41.905
That's when I made up my mind.

00:54:41.905 --> 00:54:44.205
I've decided that I must
study in Germany next.

00:54:44.205 --> 00:54:47.872
I've decided to create my own beer
that will captivate foreigners' taste buds.

00:54:47.872 --> 00:54:50.238
That's my dream.

[Day 3, 4, 5]

00:55:24.038 --> 00:55:28.738
I think it's better to raise it
just this subtly.

00:55:29.405 --> 00:55:31.972
We could even name it specifically
for soju-and-beer mixes.

00:55:31.972 --> 00:55:33.438
The 'Try' Golden Ratio Glass.

00:55:33.438 --> 00:55:34.872
Alright, cheers! Cheers!

00:55:34.872 --> 00:55:36.238

How is the change
of resort project manager going?

00:55:42.905 --> 00:55:46.405
Well, the Vice Chairman said he wants
to give Team Leader Park another chance...

00:55:46.405 --> 00:55:49.838
This project is so important to us. Are you
still looking for loyalty over capability?

00:55:49.838 --> 00:55:51.738
Find a competent person to handle it,

00:55:51.738 --> 00:55:53.672
before I leave.

00:55:53.672 --> 00:55:55.738
- Move on, please.
- At the Jeju resort,

00:55:55.738 --> 00:56:00.138
they plan to include locally crafted
brewery products in the room packages.

00:56:00.138 --> 00:56:01.272
A craft beer brewing machine.

00:56:01.272 --> 00:56:02.872
I really want that.

00:56:02.872 --> 00:56:03.973
Shall I buy you one?

00:56:03.973 --> 00:56:05.509
Hey!

00:56:15.572 --> 00:56:17.738
President.

00:56:17.738 --> 00:56:21.272
They also plan to release
a separate beer set.

00:56:22.072 --> 00:56:23.138
Yes, that sounds good.

00:56:23.138 --> 00:56:25.072
It connects with the local community.

00:56:25.072 --> 00:56:27.638
Let's extend the duration by about a week.

00:56:27.638 --> 00:56:29.605
[Day 7, 8, 9]
Next.

00:56:34.005 --> 00:56:36.838
Over here, please put it on the desk.

00:56:38.072 --> 00:56:39.805
Thank you.

[Day 9, 10, 11]

00:56:59.572 --> 00:57:01.405
When pouring wheat beer,

00:57:01.405 --> 00:57:04.705
tilt the glass at 45 degrees
and fill only 70%.

00:57:04.705 --> 00:57:07.938
Then, you should pour in the rest
including the settled yeast

00:57:07.938 --> 00:57:10.272
to deepen the flavor.

00:57:34.943 --> 00:57:38.661

Okay.

00:58:49.829 --> 00:58:51.938
- Nice.
- Great!

00:58:51.938 --> 00:58:53.972
- It's done.
- Wow.

00:58:53.972 --> 00:58:55.972
I knew this would be successful.

00:58:55.972 --> 00:58:57.738
- Fine.
- I knew this would be a hit.

00:58:57.738 --> 00:58:59.438
Go ahead.

What stomach issues are you having?

00:59:07.338 --> 00:59:10.972
I'm having indigestion
and feeling a bit nauseous.

00:59:10.972 --> 00:59:14.272
My back hurts,
and I'm shivering a little too.

00:59:14.272 --> 00:59:16.505
Well... yes.

00:59:22.305 --> 00:59:25.338
Could you possibly...

00:59:32.338 --> 00:59:33.638
No way.

00:59:33.638 --> 00:59:35.972
I'm pregnant?

00:59:37.205 --> 00:59:40.105
[5 Years Ago]
It is indeed an endometrial cyst.

00:59:40.105 --> 00:59:42.538
Moreover, your uterus is congenitally weak,

00:59:42.538 --> 00:59:45.772
so pregnancy might be difficult.

00:59:49.238 --> 00:59:50.905
They told me that pregnancy
might be difficult for me.

00:59:50.905 --> 00:59:52.872
What is this?

00:59:52.872 --> 00:59:54.538
Ah, it hurts.

Exercise, exercising.

Hurry up, I'm hungry.

01:00:00.872 --> 01:00:02.605
Yeah.

01:00:04.005 --> 01:00:05.372
Did you think I'd say that?

01:00:05.372 --> 01:00:07.105
You're acting weird today.
What is it? What are you hiding?

01:00:07.105 --> 01:00:09.872
- It's nothing.
- Got you.

01:00:11.905 --> 01:00:14.438
Mi Ran, let me explain first...

01:00:14.438 --> 01:00:16.405
Did you have a man?

01:00:17.538 --> 01:00:20.772
Last time you said you
liked someone. Is it him?

01:00:22.138 --> 01:00:24.138
Tell me quickly, who is it?

01:00:24.138 --> 01:00:25.472
Who on earth is he?

Mi Ran, wait a second.

Well, that's...

I don't know who it is.

01:00:30.672 --> 01:00:32.838
No, I know who he is.

01:00:32.838 --> 01:00:37.372
But I don't know his name or what he does...

01:00:38.372 --> 01:00:40.838
What should I do?

01:00:41.672 --> 01:00:43.938
You're now five weeks pregnant.

01:00:48.472 --> 01:00:51.172
Today, we checked
the gestational sac and yolk sac.

01:00:51.172 --> 01:00:53.872
You should be able to hear
the heartbeat around week seven.

01:00:53.872 --> 01:00:57.138
It might be slightly delayed
depending on your menstrual cycle.

Shall we schedule your next appointment?

01:01:10.805 --> 01:01:14.338
Even now, you're worried about
seeing someone you know?

What did the doctor say?
Are you actually pregnant?

What should I do now?

01:01:22.772 --> 01:01:26.405
What do you mean?
You need to find that man first.

Don't you remember anything
about the baby's father?

He's about 6'1", maybe?

He has double eyelids, thick eyebrows.

01:01:38.838 --> 01:01:42.772
He looks chic when not smiling,
but like a puppy when he does.

01:01:42.772 --> 01:01:45.972
You observed him in great detail.
