{\an8}ADAPTED FROM A SHUQI.COM NOVEL
ORIGINAL AUTHOR: SENLIN LU

00:01:44.105 --> 00:01:44.945
Of course…

00:01:46.465 --> 00:01:47.305
and you, too.

00:02:17.145 --> 00:02:18.305
Peiyi.

00:02:21.025 --> 00:02:22.665
How do you think Father

00:02:23.385 --> 00:02:24.705
will treat me?

00:02:26.625 --> 00:02:28.265
Like he's gotten me back,

00:02:29.145 --> 00:02:32.185
or will he hate having a rude,
unfilial daughter like me?

00:02:36.105 --> 00:02:37.345
His Majesty is gracious and merciful.

00:02:38.305 --> 00:02:40.665
No matter what, you're still his daughter.

00:02:57.545 --> 00:02:59.905
PALACE INVESTIGATION BUREAU

00:03:04.105 --> 00:03:06.545
Your Ladyship.
Inspector Du wants to see you.

00:03:07.705 --> 00:03:09.865
- I'm not in the mood.
- Your Ladyship, you should go.

00:03:09.945 --> 00:03:12.745
I haven't seen him that scary in ages.

00:03:27.065 --> 00:03:28.305
Why are you kneeling?

00:03:29.105 --> 00:03:31.905
Master, you called for me.
It must be because I messed up.

00:03:33.065 --> 00:03:34.145
What did you do wrong?

00:03:35.545 --> 00:03:36.665
I was too aggressive.

00:03:37.185 --> 00:03:38.305
I had no sense of limits.

00:03:38.825 --> 00:03:39.705
I overstepped my authority.

00:03:40.305 --> 00:03:41.185
Enough.

00:03:41.705 --> 00:03:42.865
All these years,

00:03:43.385 --> 00:03:45.505
I've spoiled you too much.

00:03:46.385 --> 00:03:49.105
From today on, stop taking cases.

00:03:49.745 --> 00:03:52.385
That Palace Investigation Bureau badge,
hand it over.

00:03:54.385 --> 00:03:55.225
Why should I?

00:03:55.825 --> 00:03:57.865
Because, as an Inner Guard,

00:03:57.945 --> 00:03:59.225
after you found the killer,

00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:01.985
you didn't bring her to justice at once.

00:04:02.065 --> 00:04:04.185
It looks like you were covering for her!

00:04:05.905 --> 00:04:09.025
At best, you neglected your duty.

00:04:09.105 --> 00:04:10.185
At worst,

00:04:10.265 --> 00:04:12.185
you bent the law for personal ties!

00:04:12.705 --> 00:04:13.905
Hand it over!

00:04:17.545 --> 00:04:19.064

00:04:20.425 --> 00:04:22.105
But I didn't take Wanshun
out of the Western Capital.

00:04:23.585 --> 00:04:26.025
You didn't take the last wrong step

00:04:26.105 --> 00:04:28.985
because Her Highness
knew the bigger picture.

00:04:29.065 --> 00:04:31.665
If Her Highness had insisted on leaving,

00:04:32.265 --> 00:04:36.145
right now, would you already
be on a boat heading south?

00:04:38.025 --> 00:04:40.665
If every enforcer were like you,

00:04:41.265 --> 00:04:43.345
how could the law work?

00:04:43.865 --> 00:04:45.665
Today someone covers for you,

00:04:45.745 --> 00:04:47.825
tomorrow you cover for them,

00:04:47.905 --> 00:04:49.825
and the law becomes meaningless!

00:04:51.865 --> 00:04:53.785
If I've done wrong,
I'll take my punishment.

00:04:55.305 --> 00:04:56.385
But she's Wanshun.

00:04:56.465 --> 00:04:58.105
She must face justice too!

00:05:00.105 --> 00:05:01.425
People aren't made of wood.

00:05:01.945 --> 00:05:02.905
Who can be without feelings?

00:05:05.025 --> 00:05:07.505
But you're the one enforcing the law.

00:05:08.265 --> 00:05:10.745
To rule and punish,
you can't shield your kin.

00:05:11.345 --> 00:05:14.225
Your duty is to find the truth,

00:05:14.305 --> 00:05:16.145
not judge right and wrong.

00:05:16.225 --> 00:05:19.545
If you can't even understand that,

00:05:20.225 --> 00:05:23.145
you can't shoulder this badge anymore!

00:05:26.865 --> 00:05:29.745
I know you reported everything truthfully.

00:05:29.825 --> 00:05:31.025
From here on,

00:05:31.105 --> 00:05:33.545
let His Majesty decide.

00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:36.545
ZICHEN HALL

00:05:43.945 --> 00:05:45.505
Heed His Majesty's decree!

00:05:50.465 --> 00:05:52.585
"Left General
of the Imperial Guards, Lin Ning,

00:05:52.665 --> 00:05:54.945
lusted after Princess Ningyuan's beauty

00:05:55.025 --> 00:05:57.745
and secretly bought black powder
to stage an accident.

00:05:57.825 --> 00:06:00.065
He took advantage of the chaos
to kidnap Her Highness,

00:06:00.145 --> 00:06:02.105
but Cui Manshu,
niece of the Right Chancellor,

00:06:02.185 --> 00:06:06.145
and several others
stumbled upon it by chance.

00:06:06.225 --> 00:06:10.185
Lin Ning saw his plot exposed
and brutally killed them.

00:06:10.265 --> 00:06:12.185
He fled in fear of punishment.

00:06:12.265 --> 00:06:14.185
Princess of Fuchang County, Li Peiyi,

00:06:14.265 --> 00:06:17.825
and Deputy Director of Astronomy,
Xiao Huaijin, saw it all clearly

00:06:17.905 --> 00:06:20.825
and killed him as he fled.

00:06:20.905 --> 00:06:24.385
You two acted without hesitation,
brave and smart.

00:06:24.465 --> 00:06:26.465
Princess Ningyuan was quick-witted

00:06:26.545 --> 00:06:27.905
and escaped safely.

00:06:27.985 --> 00:06:29.625
All shall be rewarded."

00:06:29.705 --> 00:06:30.825
Accept the decree!

00:06:30.905 --> 00:06:32.345
Thank you, Your Majesty,
for your kindness.

00:06:37.225 --> 00:06:39.265
Her Highness is still recovering.

00:06:39.345 --> 00:06:40.225
In three days,

00:06:40.305 --> 00:06:41.985
His Majesty will host
a banquet at Penglai Terrace

00:06:42.065 --> 00:06:43.265
in Her Highness's honor.

00:06:43.865 --> 00:06:45.785
You two may come as well.

00:06:45.865 --> 00:06:47.065
- Understood.
- Understood.

00:07:03.545 --> 00:07:04.625
Stop!

00:07:11.985 --> 00:07:14.265
Come. Come to my side.

00:07:24.145 --> 00:07:26.185
PENGLAI TERRACE

00:07:33.145 --> 00:07:34.785
Please, Your Highness.

00:07:41.745 --> 00:07:43.465
I'm sorry to worry you, Father.

00:07:45.185 --> 00:07:46.145
Come.

00:07:53.505 --> 00:07:54.345
Wanshun.

00:07:55.625 --> 00:07:58.865
I know you were wronged. I know it all.

00:08:02.705 --> 00:08:03.625
Father…

00:08:06.305 --> 00:08:08.065
You're so generous and kind,

00:08:08.825 --> 00:08:10.745
yet for my own selfish gain,

00:08:11.265 --> 00:08:12.945
I stirred up such chaos.

00:08:15.705 --> 00:08:17.105
My child, you've suffered.

00:08:18.265 --> 00:08:21.545
I won't let any child of mine be wronged.

00:08:22.545 --> 00:08:25.905
I'll prepare another
generous dowry for you,

00:08:25.985 --> 00:08:28.705
so you'll marry in peace,

00:08:29.305 --> 00:08:30.225
with no worries.

00:08:34.985 --> 00:08:37.305
Congratulations, Princess Ningyuan!

00:08:37.865 --> 00:08:41.705
Your Majesty, what boundless favor!

00:08:41.784 --> 00:08:44.505
In Uyghur,

00:08:44.585 --> 00:08:45.985
Her Highness will be

00:08:46.065 --> 00:08:48.785
the most honored, noblest queen.

00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:54.785
Thank you, Father.

00:08:58.745 --> 00:08:59.945
Don't be rash.

00:09:03.425 --> 00:09:04.705
Please withdraw your order, Your Majesty.

00:09:08.345 --> 00:09:10.385
Wanshun is a daughter of my Li family,

00:09:10.465 --> 00:09:11.785
a princess of Great Tang.

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:14.465
If your father and mother
were still alive,

00:09:15.065 --> 00:09:17.265
they'd surely explain the sense of it all.

00:09:17.905 --> 00:09:19.705
But since they're gone,

00:09:20.225 --> 00:09:21.865
I don't have to understand it.

00:09:24.985 --> 00:09:26.145
Peiyi.

00:09:26.225 --> 00:09:27.505
Your Majesty,

00:09:27.585 --> 00:09:30.065
Her Highness was blessed by your grace
and turned disaster into luck.

00:09:30.145 --> 00:09:33.705
Her match with Prince Wutele

00:09:33.785 --> 00:09:35.945
is fated to be.

00:09:36.025 --> 00:09:37.145
Peiyi…

00:09:39.105 --> 00:09:41.065
Let me speak to His Majesty myself.

00:09:44.545 --> 00:09:46.225
Your Majesty, if you're still in the mood,

00:09:47.105 --> 00:09:48.745
may I offer a dance,

00:09:49.425 --> 00:09:52.545
the Zhezhi Dance
Mother once performed for you,

00:09:53.345 --> 00:09:54.505
to thank your grace?

00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:09.385
PENGLAI TERRACE

00:11:31.145 --> 00:11:32.425
For 18 years,

00:11:33.145 --> 00:11:35.985
I never had the chance to speak with you.

00:11:36.625 --> 00:11:37.745
Today is a rare opportunity.

00:11:38.265 --> 00:11:40.425
I want to say what's in my heart.

00:11:41.545 --> 00:11:42.825
Or later,

00:11:44.065 --> 00:11:45.905
I may never get the chance.

00:11:48.665 --> 00:11:52.585
I'm lucky to be your daughter.

00:11:53.665 --> 00:11:55.345
But my luck is also limited.

00:11:56.185 --> 00:11:57.665
In 18 years,

00:11:59.065 --> 00:12:01.025
you only saw me three times.

00:12:03.705 --> 00:12:04.825
The first time,

00:12:05.785 --> 00:12:07.305
I was still little.

00:12:08.465 --> 00:12:11.185
You were checking
the princes' and princesses' lessons.

00:12:11.785 --> 00:12:13.385
You praised me for my talent,

00:12:15.105 --> 00:12:16.785
so I studied hard.

00:12:21.585 --> 00:12:23.225
From then on,

00:12:25.025 --> 00:12:28.625
I never had another chance
to show you my work.

00:12:36.385 --> 00:12:37.625
The second time,

00:12:38.745 --> 00:12:40.265
at your birthday banquet,

00:12:41.305 --> 00:12:44.105
I embroidered for you
"Dragon Soars Across the Seas."

00:12:44.985 --> 00:12:46.705
You praised it greatly

00:12:47.665 --> 00:12:48.585
and finally remembered

00:12:49.305 --> 00:12:51.705
you had a daughter
born of a desert dancer.

00:12:53.745 --> 00:12:55.225
So I kept improving my embroidery.

00:12:59.985 --> 00:13:00.905
Your Highness, please.

00:13:07.545 --> 00:13:09.225
Your embroidery has gotten even better.

00:13:09.305 --> 00:13:11.665
Give it to His Majesty
before the spring hunt.

00:13:11.745 --> 00:13:12.745
He will surely be pleased.

00:13:14.305 --> 00:13:15.385
But my patterns

00:13:17.745 --> 00:13:20.865
never had another chance
to be shown to you.

00:13:24.665 --> 00:13:25.985
The third time

00:13:27.905 --> 00:13:29.185
was this betrothal.

00:13:31.905 --> 00:13:33.185
This might be

00:13:34.265 --> 00:13:36.705
the best fate for me…

00:13:38.625 --> 00:13:40.465
as your daughter.

00:14:12.625 --> 00:14:13.825
But it's not so bad.

00:14:15.145 --> 00:14:16.225
Father,

00:14:17.505 --> 00:14:19.225
you won't forget me again.

00:14:27.705 --> 00:14:28.905
- Wanshun!
- Your Highness!

00:14:43.145 --> 00:14:43.985
Wanshun?

00:14:49.985 --> 00:14:50.865
Wanshun…

00:14:54.545 --> 00:14:55.665
Peiyi…

00:14:56.745 --> 00:14:58.105
You're so stupid.

00:14:59.625 --> 00:15:00.705
Why would you do this?

00:15:00.785 --> 00:15:01.905
Because…

00:15:03.185 --> 00:15:04.465
this way…

00:15:05.385 --> 00:15:09.345
no one can force me again
to do what I don't want.

00:15:12.265 --> 00:15:15.745
PENGLAI TERRACE

00:15:50.065 --> 00:15:51.025
Stop acting.

00:15:51.105 --> 00:15:53.145
Who keeps staring at a flower all day?

00:15:54.065 --> 00:15:55.385
His Majesty didn't see you.

00:15:55.465 --> 00:15:57.545
Those palace maids didn't see you either.

00:15:57.625 --> 00:15:59.065
You just tripped.

00:15:59.145 --> 00:16:00.425
Don't mind it.

00:16:02.505 --> 00:16:03.945
But it's fine.

00:16:04.025 --> 00:16:06.225
I saw it all, every bit.

00:16:16.345 --> 00:16:17.545
His Majesty asked me to give you this.

00:16:22.665 --> 00:16:24.625
Since you already finished
that horseback piece,

00:16:25.145 --> 00:16:26.305
why didn't you tell me sooner?

00:16:27.345 --> 00:16:29.905
Then I could help you get it
to His Majesty before the spring hunt.

00:16:29.985 --> 00:16:31.105
He would surely want to see you.

00:16:31.905 --> 00:16:32.985
It wasn't well done.

00:16:33.505 --> 00:16:34.345
Next time.

00:16:39.825 --> 00:16:42.265
These gold bangles are the prettiest.

00:16:43.265 --> 00:16:44.105
One for you, one for me.

00:16:47.105 --> 00:16:48.305
I hope someday

00:16:49.385 --> 00:16:51.305
we'll meet again.

00:17:24.464 --> 00:17:25.944
The ones who killed Wanshun…

00:17:28.905 --> 00:17:30.705
Lin Ning is one.

00:17:31.905 --> 00:17:33.745
Cui Manshu is one.

00:17:36.105 --> 00:17:37.425
I'm one.

00:17:41.625 --> 00:17:42.945
And…

00:17:43.545 --> 00:17:44.785
Who else?

00:17:47.705 --> 00:17:48.545
Your Majesty,

00:17:49.065 --> 00:17:50.665
the county princess
has been tirelessly working.

00:17:50.745 --> 00:17:51.905
And she lost her closest friend today,

00:17:51.985 --> 00:17:53.025
overcome with grief.

00:17:53.105 --> 00:17:55.585
Please allow her to rest for a few days.

00:18:13.265 --> 00:18:14.785
His Majesty is considerate.

00:18:14.865 --> 00:18:16.225
Your Ladyship, rest well.

00:18:16.305 --> 00:18:18.225
Stay away from the hall,

00:18:18.825 --> 00:18:21.425
or seeing things there
will stir old feelings

00:18:21.505 --> 00:18:23.065
and make you upset again.

00:18:36.785 --> 00:18:40.105
ZICHEN HALL

00:18:40.185 --> 00:18:42.425
VIRTUE SHINING, EVER-PROGRESSING

00:18:44.705 --> 00:18:46.665
Your Majesty, the matter
you ordered has a lead.

00:18:54.825 --> 00:18:55.705
Speak closer.

00:18:57.145 --> 00:18:59.105
A STAR HAS APPEARED IN THE GIRL MANSION
IT IS A MOST OMINOUS SIGN

00:18:59.185 --> 00:19:01.345
ON THE WUWU DAY OF THE FIRST MONTH
THE STAR HAS APPEARED

00:19:02.625 --> 00:19:05.465
This paper was found
in Princess Ningyuan's residence.

00:19:13.945 --> 00:19:16.505
Wanshun must have been misled
by that traitor Lin Ning

00:19:16.585 --> 00:19:17.945
to come up with such a foolish move.

00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:22.625
Lin Ning could move freely in the palace.

00:19:23.865 --> 00:19:25.665
Getting a secret memorial into the palace

00:19:26.185 --> 00:19:27.545
was not difficult task.

00:19:40.545 --> 00:19:42.225
Now that Wanshun has passed,

00:19:42.985 --> 00:19:44.025
has the omen come true?

00:19:45.425 --> 00:19:47.105
I dare not presume Heaven's will.

00:19:47.185 --> 00:19:49.305
But it seems this matter
doesn't involve the former dynasty.

00:19:49.385 --> 00:19:51.025
Your Majesty needn't worry.

00:20:00.945 --> 00:20:05.185
{\an8}TANG

00:20:17.825 --> 00:20:19.945
PRINCESS ZHAOYUAN

00:20:38.945 --> 00:20:41.425
Wanshun paid with her life
to escape that road.

00:20:42.305 --> 00:20:44.145
In the end, someone still has to walk it.

00:20:48.945 --> 00:20:51.345
There's something
I must confess to Your Ladyship.

00:20:53.425 --> 00:20:54.585
Before the banquet that day,

00:20:55.105 --> 00:20:56.345
I met the Fifteenth Princess.

00:20:58.385 --> 00:20:59.705
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:21:05.465 --> 00:21:06.345
Deputy Director Xiao,

00:21:07.105 --> 00:21:08.545
I have a question.

00:21:09.465 --> 00:21:10.385
I wouldn't dare.

00:21:11.105 --> 00:21:14.345
Do you think the stars above

00:21:15.225 --> 00:21:17.145
can truly foretell human affairs?

00:21:20.145 --> 00:21:22.585
I only know the stars
don't cause conflicts.

00:21:22.665 --> 00:21:25.345
But people use star omens
to stir up trouble.

00:21:26.345 --> 00:21:28.065
Then, in your view,

00:21:28.585 --> 00:21:30.465
was the chaos of the Lantern Festival

00:21:31.145 --> 00:21:32.705
caused by an omen

00:21:32.785 --> 00:21:34.865
or by people fabricating one?

00:21:36.745 --> 00:21:38.465
Every matter has its reason

00:21:38.545 --> 00:21:39.945
and a whole story behind it.

00:21:40.025 --> 00:21:42.545
Your Highness being safe
is what matters most.

00:21:44.105 --> 00:21:45.345
So you already knew.

00:21:45.425 --> 00:21:48.105
Looks like you don't believe in fate.

00:21:48.185 --> 00:21:49.345
I do.

00:21:51.465 --> 00:21:52.985
But we mortals

00:21:53.065 --> 00:21:54.665
can see what fate looks like

00:21:54.745 --> 00:21:56.345
only at the end of life.

00:22:01.545 --> 00:22:02.465
Thank you.

00:22:06.865 --> 00:22:08.865
You saw that secret memorial?

00:22:11.705 --> 00:22:14.865
You must've guessed
it was me and the Princess together.

00:22:14.945 --> 00:22:16.625
At the Princess's residence,

00:22:16.705 --> 00:22:18.625
I found clues
tied to that secret memorial.

00:22:20.065 --> 00:22:21.505
But the Princess alone

00:22:21.585 --> 00:22:24.665
couldn't have gotten that memorial
into His Majesty's study.

00:22:25.625 --> 00:22:28.185
It's a pity that even after seeing
such a dire omen,

00:22:29.025 --> 00:22:30.825
His Majesty still
wouldn't change his mind.

00:22:35.305 --> 00:22:36.625
Congratulations, Deputy Director Xiao.

00:22:36.705 --> 00:22:37.865
Why congratulate me?

00:22:37.945 --> 00:22:40.185
Back then, you agreed
to help me with the case

00:22:40.785 --> 00:22:42.185
because you wanted the chance

00:22:42.265 --> 00:22:44.505
to help His Majesty find
who delivered the secret memorial.

00:22:44.585 --> 00:22:46.425
Now the Princess's case is solved.

00:22:46.505 --> 00:22:49.105
The matter you wanted to check
is clear as day.

00:22:49.185 --> 00:22:50.225
Isn't that worth celebrating?

00:22:50.825 --> 00:22:52.105
His Majesty believes

00:22:52.185 --> 00:22:54.865
this was all Lin Ning
talking the Princess into it.

00:22:59.505 --> 00:23:00.345
Mr. Xiao.

00:23:02.345 --> 00:23:03.745
Law and loyalty…

00:23:04.265 --> 00:23:05.425
How can you have both?

00:23:05.505 --> 00:23:07.945
The law is where rule begins.

00:23:08.465 --> 00:23:10.545
A gentleman is where rule is rooted.

00:23:13.585 --> 00:23:15.025
I'm odd and unruly.

00:23:15.545 --> 00:23:16.385
I'm no gentleman.

00:23:17.105 --> 00:23:18.545
But I'm no villain either.

00:23:19.145 --> 00:23:20.665
I don't really know you,

00:23:20.745 --> 00:23:21.865
so I can't judge,

00:23:21.945 --> 00:23:22.865
and I won't accuse you.

00:23:24.905 --> 00:23:27.425
Farmers have their hardships.

00:23:27.505 --> 00:23:29.665
People in the deep palace have theirs.

00:23:30.185 --> 00:23:31.945
I just had a bit of luck,

00:23:32.545 --> 00:23:33.865
played a few clever tricks,

00:23:34.385 --> 00:23:36.585
won a little favor,
and only then stood back up.

00:23:39.025 --> 00:23:40.825
Wanshun was another me.

00:23:42.945 --> 00:23:44.705
A me who never stood back up.

00:23:49.505 --> 00:23:51.945
His Majesty has ordered a lavish burial
for the Fifteenth Princess.

00:23:52.025 --> 00:23:53.865
Posthumous title, Zhaosi.

00:23:54.665 --> 00:23:56.465
His Majesty still cherished
the Fifteenth Princess.

00:23:56.545 --> 00:23:59.785
You and I both know what "cherish" means.

00:24:03.265 --> 00:24:05.185
"Soaring past clouds,

00:24:05.825 --> 00:24:07.665
the soul ascends."

00:24:07.745 --> 00:24:08.905
Good thing

00:24:09.425 --> 00:24:11.425
she's already gone
to the place she wanted.

00:24:17.265 --> 00:24:19.425
You're not a cold, rigid man of law.

00:24:20.945 --> 00:24:23.225
I know that when
you came back from the temple,

00:24:24.185 --> 00:24:25.505
you didn't go to see His Majesty.

00:24:39.945 --> 00:24:43.505
PALACE INVESTIGATION BUREAU

00:24:53.265 --> 00:24:55.945
XIAO

00:25:17.105 --> 00:25:19.945
XIAO'S MANSION

00:25:21.305 --> 00:25:24.585
Huaijin is usually on duty
at the Astronomical Bureau

00:25:25.105 --> 00:25:26.345
and rarely comes home.

00:25:26.985 --> 00:25:30.145
Looks like you came for nothing.

00:25:31.665 --> 00:25:32.505
It's fine.

00:25:33.025 --> 00:25:35.705
The cakes you made
are even better than the palace ones.

00:25:35.785 --> 00:25:36.625
I didn't come for nothing.

00:25:37.345 --> 00:25:40.225
Your Ladyship, so you like touhua cakes?

00:25:42.145 --> 00:25:44.145
When I was little, I'd throw a fit.

00:25:44.225 --> 00:25:46.225
Only touhua cakes could cheer me up.

00:25:46.745 --> 00:25:47.665
They're soft, sweet.

00:25:47.745 --> 00:25:48.785
One bite and I'd feel right.

00:25:48.865 --> 00:25:50.305
Then I'd calm right down.

00:25:52.825 --> 00:25:56.385
Madam, your scent
is different from Mr. Xiao's sachet.

00:25:58.145 --> 00:25:59.465
That kind of sachet

00:25:59.545 --> 00:26:01.785
was made just for him and his father.

00:26:01.865 --> 00:26:05.665
My own incense is mostly floral.

00:26:07.345 --> 00:26:08.945
You make your own incense?

00:26:10.625 --> 00:26:11.745
Bring me my incense.

00:26:34.865 --> 00:26:37.425
None of these are what Mr. Xiao uses.

00:26:37.505 --> 00:26:40.145
They've used theirs up,
and I haven't made more yet.

00:26:40.825 --> 00:26:43.825
These scents
don't include the one you like?

00:26:43.905 --> 00:26:47.185
In Mr. Xiao's sachet,
there are sandalwood and myrrh.

00:26:47.265 --> 00:26:48.105
I really like it.

00:26:48.865 --> 00:26:52.345
Princess Consort of Duan
also likes men's incense.

00:26:54.625 --> 00:26:57.185
Your Ladyship is so dashing.

00:26:57.265 --> 00:27:00.505
You really do look like her in her youth.

00:27:02.625 --> 00:27:03.905
I misspoke.

00:27:04.425 --> 00:27:05.345
I've offended you.

00:27:05.985 --> 00:27:08.625
Please forgive me.

00:27:09.545 --> 00:27:12.625
The case at my home
15 years ago was too tragic.

00:27:13.145 --> 00:27:14.225
It's no secret.

00:27:15.145 --> 00:27:16.425
But these 15 years,

00:27:17.025 --> 00:27:18.705
everyone's been afraid to offend me.

00:27:19.225 --> 00:27:21.705
So, about my parents,
they all keep it hush-hush.

00:27:22.305 --> 00:27:24.945
I thought no one remembered Prince of Duan
or his consort anymore.

00:27:26.265 --> 00:27:28.545
Hearing you praise my mother just now,

00:27:28.625 --> 00:27:29.825
I'm truly comforted.

00:27:32.545 --> 00:27:33.985
Madam, don't be so stiff.

00:27:34.505 --> 00:27:36.945
I'd actually like to hear more
about my father and my mother.

00:27:39.985 --> 00:27:41.385
When I was young,

00:27:42.105 --> 00:27:43.785
I met Princess Consort of Duan once

00:27:44.305 --> 00:27:46.625
at the Shangsi Festival.

00:27:46.705 --> 00:27:48.145
Her Highness

00:27:48.665 --> 00:27:49.865
was stunning,

00:27:49.945 --> 00:27:51.905
bright and bold.

00:27:51.985 --> 00:27:53.305
Unforgettable at first sight.

00:27:53.385 --> 00:27:56.825
Prince of Duan was brave in battle,

00:27:56.905 --> 00:27:58.385
his name known far and wide.

00:27:59.225 --> 00:28:00.385
Heaven…

00:28:01.665 --> 00:28:03.465
is always so unfair.

00:28:05.945 --> 00:28:06.905
Yes.

00:28:07.785 --> 00:28:09.265
From that Lantern Festival on,

00:28:09.785 --> 00:28:11.745
I could never reunite
with my parents again.

00:28:14.025 --> 00:28:16.025
That Lantern Festival,

00:28:16.825 --> 00:28:17.705
Huaijin

00:28:18.425 --> 00:28:21.865
was on night duty
at the Astronomical Bureau

00:28:22.385 --> 00:28:23.465
and didn't come home.

00:28:24.065 --> 00:28:27.705
My husband and I
kept Old Madam Xiao company.

00:28:27.785 --> 00:28:30.385
She was used to keeping vigil
and chanting sutras

00:28:30.465 --> 00:28:32.225
during the Lantern Festival.

00:28:33.025 --> 00:28:34.945
She only slept after midnight.

00:28:36.145 --> 00:28:38.865
That night, my husband
had official business,

00:28:38.945 --> 00:28:41.025
but to honor his filial duty,

00:28:41.545 --> 00:28:44.945
he stayed with Old Madam
through the Zi hour,

00:28:45.025 --> 00:28:46.385
then hurried out.

00:28:49.465 --> 00:28:50.585
The Zi hour?

00:28:52.985 --> 00:28:56.225
Early the next morning,
my husband came home.

00:28:56.305 --> 00:28:57.785
Only then did I learn

00:28:57.865 --> 00:28:59.625
something terrible had happened.

00:29:05.585 --> 00:29:07.505
I was too young back then.

00:29:08.025 --> 00:29:09.585
I don't remember that night at all.

00:29:10.265 --> 00:29:13.545
For some things, to forget

00:29:14.465 --> 00:29:16.025
is a blessing in itself.

00:29:31.145 --> 00:29:31.985
Move.

00:29:35.705 --> 00:29:38.145
So you finally visited the Xiao's mansion.

00:29:39.705 --> 00:29:40.865
How else would I find the killer?

00:29:41.745 --> 00:29:44.225
If you can find the killer here,

00:29:44.305 --> 00:29:45.585
I'll call you Master.

00:29:46.745 --> 00:29:47.905
Why can't I?

00:29:48.585 --> 00:29:49.985
So you really are
hiding something from me!

00:29:51.305 --> 00:29:52.265
Yes.

00:29:52.345 --> 00:29:55.105
I hid it from you.
I drank great wine at Zuixian House.

00:29:55.945 --> 00:29:59.305
And I ate a plate
of top-notch braised lamb.

00:30:02.905 --> 00:30:04.145
So what did you find?

00:30:07.145 --> 00:30:09.505
Looks like you found nothing.

00:30:10.225 --> 00:30:11.105
My guess is,

00:30:11.185 --> 00:30:12.945
on the Lantern Festival night
15 years ago,

00:30:13.025 --> 00:30:16.825
they haven't sent anyone
to visit your family.

00:30:18.825 --> 00:30:21.065
Clearing suspicion is still a gain.

00:30:22.465 --> 00:30:23.465
Peiyi,

00:30:24.265 --> 00:30:25.785
let it go.

00:30:25.865 --> 00:30:29.665
Clinging too hard makes you see
enemies everywhere and clouds your mind.

00:30:29.745 --> 00:30:33.705
What was clear and simple
will turn hard to grasp.

00:30:35.465 --> 00:30:37.705
But if I can't even trust myself,

00:30:40.745 --> 00:30:42.225
who can I trust?

00:30:55.385 --> 00:30:56.505
Don't worry.

00:30:57.905 --> 00:30:59.465
Whatever I said back then,

00:31:00.745 --> 00:31:03.545
today I'll say the same.

00:31:05.385 --> 00:31:06.585
Do you think

00:31:08.345 --> 00:31:09.665
she truly forgot?

00:31:11.825 --> 00:31:13.985
She is sharp and quick.

00:31:14.825 --> 00:31:15.985
She came today

00:31:16.585 --> 00:31:19.585
for more than just liking that incense.

00:31:20.185 --> 00:31:23.745
If she remembers,
we must find a way to handle it.

00:31:24.345 --> 00:31:26.145
If she doesn't…

00:31:26.225 --> 00:31:27.665
We must stop her from remembering.

00:31:30.185 --> 00:31:32.305
If she doesn't get
the answers she wants here,

00:31:32.825 --> 00:31:34.145
she likely won't come again.

00:31:36.585 --> 00:31:38.105
Thank you, Mother.

00:31:38.185 --> 00:31:39.345
I'm going back to the Astronomical Bureau.

00:31:40.425 --> 00:31:42.385
Your father will be back soon.

00:31:42.905 --> 00:31:45.385
- See him before you go.
- No need.

00:31:46.265 --> 00:31:49.145
And today's matter
needn't be told to Father.

00:31:51.945 --> 00:31:53.145
I'll be going now.

00:32:01.225 --> 00:32:03.425
SPRING OF THE 13TH, YEAR OF DALI

00:32:03.505 --> 00:32:04.945
XINGQING PALACE

00:32:13.985 --> 00:32:17.545
So there really are
such special flowers in this world.

00:32:18.145 --> 00:32:20.065
I thought it was an exaggeration.

00:32:27.345 --> 00:32:28.505
Your Majesty, look.

00:32:29.305 --> 00:32:30.305
When the breeze blows,

00:32:30.985 --> 00:32:32.345
they glimmer with light.

00:32:32.425 --> 00:32:34.105
Like droplets of water.

00:32:35.865 --> 00:32:39.745
They aren't like the peony,
so grand and noble, so bold and open.

00:32:39.825 --> 00:32:41.585
But they're delicate and enchanting.

00:32:43.865 --> 00:32:46.985
And their scent is faint, yet there.

00:32:47.065 --> 00:32:49.025
It makes you want to lean in.

00:32:49.545 --> 00:32:51.465
No wonder they're called "Hundred Charms."

00:33:08.025 --> 00:33:11.025
Your Majesty,
this lady truly is so beautiful

00:33:11.105 --> 00:33:14.225
that it shames the moon and flowers.

00:33:15.625 --> 00:33:18.105
These flowers should be given to a beauty.

00:33:18.865 --> 00:33:21.665
This servant will pick them
for you at once!

00:33:38.745 --> 00:33:41.345
The wall!
There's something inside the wall!

00:33:44.665 --> 00:33:45.705
Your Majesty!

00:33:57.345 --> 00:33:58.065
- Your Majesty!
- Hurry!

00:33:58.145 --> 00:33:59.505
Get Consort Shu back to her palace, now!

00:33:59.585 --> 00:34:00.665
Get Consort Shu back to her palace!

00:34:00.745 --> 00:34:01.825
I deserve death!

00:34:01.905 --> 00:34:03.865
I deserve death!

00:34:08.225 --> 00:34:11.385
In Xingqing Palace, such cruelty happened!

00:34:11.985 --> 00:34:14.185
Summon the Palace Investigation Bureau
to thoroughly investigate it!

00:34:14.784 --> 00:34:17.185
This servant obeys!

00:34:27.665 --> 00:34:29.665
Thanks for covering for me,
Deputy Director Xiao.

00:34:30.264 --> 00:34:33.025
That robe… Let me burn it for you.

00:34:33.744 --> 00:34:34.585
Much obliged.

00:34:36.625 --> 00:34:37.665
Hurry!

00:34:59.305 --> 00:35:02.225
FLOWER ON THE WALL

00:35:11.825 --> 00:35:13.225
Your Ladyship,

00:35:13.305 --> 00:35:15.625
you just got your post back.
Don't do anything rash.

00:35:15.705 --> 00:35:17.545
By the order of His Majesty,
you are forbidden to examine the body.

00:35:18.145 --> 00:35:20.505
Keep your voice down.
Then no one will know.

00:35:22.585 --> 00:35:24.145
"Hundred Charms"?

00:35:24.705 --> 00:35:26.265
More like "demon charms."

00:35:27.145 --> 00:35:28.425
What did the Assistant Director here say?

00:35:29.065 --> 00:35:30.945
Tried to be clever, scared stiff,

00:35:31.025 --> 00:35:32.145
he couldn't say a word.

00:35:32.865 --> 00:35:34.225
Take him back.
We'll question him tomorrow.

00:35:34.305 --> 00:35:35.185
- Understood!
- Understood!

00:35:45.105 --> 00:35:46.145
Your Ladyship,

00:35:46.225 --> 00:35:48.545
I heard there's a man-eating flower
in the South Sea.

00:35:48.625 --> 00:35:51.105
Its seeds are tiny as sand, light as dust,

00:35:51.185 --> 00:35:52.345
hard to notice.

00:35:52.865 --> 00:35:54.865
If it lands on someone,
it takes root right away,

00:35:55.745 --> 00:35:58.145
feeding on flesh as soil,
marrow as fertilizer.

00:35:58.225 --> 00:36:00.105
By the time you notice,
it's already too late.

00:36:00.705 --> 00:36:02.665
You can only be drained alive

00:36:03.745 --> 00:36:04.745
and die in agony.

00:36:29.465 --> 00:36:30.385
Xiang embroidery…

00:36:31.025 --> 00:36:32.545
It must be from the palace.

00:36:33.145 --> 00:36:35.105
The seeds in the sachet sprouted,

00:36:35.905 --> 00:36:37.745
using the soil inside the wall
and the spring rain,

00:36:37.825 --> 00:36:39.265
and bloomed into flowers.

00:36:41.705 --> 00:36:42.945
Director of Embroidery, take a look.

00:36:43.025 --> 00:36:44.705
Is this stitching Xiang embroidery?

00:36:45.305 --> 00:36:46.985
Your Ladyship, it is Xiang embroidery.

00:36:47.065 --> 00:36:50.065
And workmanship like this
can only be Birou's.

00:36:50.145 --> 00:36:51.345
Get her out here.

00:36:51.425 --> 00:36:52.905
Birou isn't with
the Palace Workshop Service.

00:36:52.985 --> 00:36:54.105
She serves Talent Wang.

00:36:54.705 --> 00:36:55.865
Please wait.

00:37:00.025 --> 00:37:01.505
Your Ladyship, are you saying…

00:37:03.105 --> 00:37:05.825
the owner of this sachet is already dead?

00:37:05.905 --> 00:37:06.745
BIROU, PALACE MAID

00:37:12.865 --> 00:37:14.025
Your Ladyship,

00:37:15.065 --> 00:37:17.905
I gave this sachet to Hanxiao.

00:37:19.425 --> 00:37:21.865
Hanxiao from Consort Shu's palace?

00:37:23.945 --> 00:37:26.145
Did Hanxiao have any identifying marks?

00:37:26.225 --> 00:37:29.665
On the inside of both ankles,
she had cinnabar moles,

00:37:29.745 --> 00:37:32.745
perfectly symmetrical, very distinctive.

00:37:37.305 --> 00:37:38.385
Your Ladyship,

00:37:39.545 --> 00:37:41.185
did that body have them?

00:37:44.985 --> 00:37:47.065
PALACE INVESTIGATION BUREAU

00:37:47.145 --> 00:37:48.705
I found Hanxiao's exit record
in the Bureau of Palace Ladies,

00:37:48.785 --> 00:37:50.185
dated half a year ago.

00:37:50.265 --> 00:37:51.465
His Majesty cares for the palace maids.

00:37:51.545 --> 00:37:53.865
Every maid released
gets a resettlement payment,

00:37:53.945 --> 00:37:56.345
so they can marry and make a living.

00:37:56.425 --> 00:37:57.905
She already collected the money.

00:37:57.985 --> 00:38:00.265
Her exit date and household register
are all here.

00:38:04.385 --> 00:38:05.465
Chang'an County…

00:38:09.985 --> 00:38:11.425
Is this the Cai household?

00:38:11.505 --> 00:38:12.545
Yes.

00:38:15.385 --> 00:38:17.625
Miss, you're from the palace?

00:38:18.745 --> 00:38:20.385
Do you know my elder sister Hanxiao?

00:38:20.465 --> 00:38:22.065
So, you're Hanxiao's younger sister?

00:38:22.145 --> 00:38:23.585
Yes. My name's Zhenzhen.

00:38:24.105 --> 00:38:26.065
Miss, do you have any news of my sister?

00:38:26.625 --> 00:38:27.625
Who is it?

00:38:29.305 --> 00:38:31.425
Mother! They're from the palace!

00:38:33.785 --> 00:38:36.145
So, do you have any news of Hanxiao?

00:38:37.945 --> 00:38:41.345
Hanxiao was my best friend in the palace.

00:38:42.345 --> 00:38:44.625
After she left the palace, we lost touch.

00:38:44.705 --> 00:38:48.185
I came to Chang'an County on business
today, so I thought I'd check on her.

00:38:48.705 --> 00:38:49.945
How could she go missing?

00:38:52.185 --> 00:38:55.225
Outside the palace,
did she have anyone close?

00:38:55.305 --> 00:38:57.745
She never talked to us about that.

00:38:57.825 --> 00:38:59.585
So I don't know.

00:39:06.265 --> 00:39:08.505
Miss, I heard

00:39:09.105 --> 00:39:11.625
the court gives those leaving the palace

00:39:11.705 --> 00:39:13.105
a resettlement payment.

00:39:13.865 --> 00:39:15.025
Is that true?

00:39:15.625 --> 00:39:18.185
Of course. It's a lot of money.

00:39:18.265 --> 00:39:19.785
Then…

00:39:19.865 --> 00:39:21.825
can we… claim it?

00:39:24.625 --> 00:39:27.345
Why? Is your family short on money?

00:39:29.865 --> 00:39:31.585
My husband has been sickly.

00:39:31.665 --> 00:39:34.465
He can only mind a shop for others
and earns next to nothing.

00:39:35.185 --> 00:39:37.025
But everything costs money at home.

00:39:37.105 --> 00:39:39.185
Thankfully, we had Hanxiao.

00:39:39.265 --> 00:39:42.105
She landed a position in the palace
and supported us all.

00:39:42.185 --> 00:39:43.945
She was our backbone.

00:39:44.025 --> 00:39:45.985
If you rely on Hanxiao to support you,

00:39:46.065 --> 00:39:47.185
shouldn't you find her first?

00:39:49.345 --> 00:39:50.345
We…

00:39:50.865 --> 00:39:52.625
We will!

00:39:53.145 --> 00:39:56.065
But our whole family has to live, too.

00:39:57.905 --> 00:39:59.665
Madam, it's been so hard on you.

00:40:02.025 --> 00:40:04.745
This is all the money I have. Here.

00:40:05.305 --> 00:40:06.345
Oh…

00:40:08.825 --> 00:40:09.985
Well…

00:40:10.065 --> 00:40:13.065
I just don't know
where else to get news of Hanxiao.

00:40:15.625 --> 00:40:17.985
We have letters she sent before.

00:40:19.065 --> 00:40:20.705
Go get them, now! Hurry!

00:40:23.465 --> 00:40:25.345
The really old ones are gone.

00:40:25.865 --> 00:40:27.585
These are from the past two years,

00:40:27.665 --> 00:40:29.705
up until she went missing.

00:40:30.345 --> 00:40:31.505
I kept them all carefully.

00:40:32.425 --> 00:40:34.865
Miss, take a look. Maybe they'll help.

00:40:38.505 --> 00:40:39.425
I'll come again another day.

00:40:40.705 --> 00:40:42.505
If you remember anything else,

00:40:42.585 --> 00:40:43.665
tell me right away.

00:40:43.745 --> 00:40:45.385
Yes!

00:40:47.665 --> 00:40:49.745
Hanxiao was blessed to have friends

00:40:49.825 --> 00:40:51.305
like you two.

00:40:51.385 --> 00:40:52.585
Truly blessed!

00:41:06.505 --> 00:41:07.425
Miss!

00:41:09.425 --> 00:41:10.265
Miss!

00:41:11.185 --> 00:41:13.185
If you find my sister, please tell her

00:41:13.785 --> 00:41:14.985
I'm grown up now.

00:41:15.065 --> 00:41:17.305
I can fold 500 paper ingots
and earn one wen.

00:41:17.385 --> 00:41:18.705
I can help the household.

00:41:19.745 --> 00:41:21.505
She doesn't have to work so hard.

00:41:23.865 --> 00:41:25.065
And…

00:41:25.665 --> 00:41:27.625
if she really doesn't want to come back,

00:41:28.585 --> 00:41:29.425
then let her go.

00:41:31.025 --> 00:41:32.545
I won't beg her to return.

00:41:33.385 --> 00:41:34.785
I just want her safe.

00:41:49.905 --> 00:41:50.785
Hide it well.

00:41:50.865 --> 00:41:52.305
Don't let anyone find it.

00:41:52.825 --> 00:41:54.225
If your parents try
to send you into the palace

00:41:54.305 --> 00:41:55.545
or force you to marry,

00:41:55.625 --> 00:41:56.785
take this jade token

00:41:56.865 --> 00:41:58.345
to the Palace Investigation Bureau
in Xingqing Palace.

00:41:58.425 --> 00:41:59.385
Remember?

00:42:00.425 --> 00:42:03.105
Promise me,
and I'll help you find your sister.

00:42:06.065 --> 00:42:08.625
ZUIXIAN HOUSE

00:42:11.425 --> 00:42:12.825
Money for her father's medicine,

00:42:12.905 --> 00:42:14.065
money for her brother's schooling,

00:42:14.145 --> 00:42:15.705
money to fix the stove,

00:42:15.785 --> 00:42:17.625
money for coal and winter clothes…

00:42:17.705 --> 00:42:19.905
These letters are basically
about the family asking for money

00:42:19.985 --> 00:42:20.905
and Hanxiao sending money.

00:42:21.625 --> 00:42:23.705
That family is playing poor,
squeezing their daughter dry.

00:42:23.785 --> 00:42:25.385
You paid so much for these letters.

00:42:25.465 --> 00:42:27.505
You're encouraging
their habit of extortion.

00:42:28.865 --> 00:42:29.785
Look again.

00:42:29.865 --> 00:42:31.385
Do they say anything else?

00:42:32.025 --> 00:42:33.385
Where she'd go after leaving the palace,

00:42:33.465 --> 00:42:34.825
whether she needed
her parents to meet her, anything.

00:42:35.425 --> 00:42:36.985
There are lots still unopened.

00:42:37.065 --> 00:42:38.225
I'll read them one by one.

00:42:38.305 --> 00:42:40.305
Even if there is,
it's not worth that much.

00:42:41.985 --> 00:42:43.185
This lamb is so tender.

00:42:43.265 --> 00:42:44.465
Try some.

00:42:52.665 --> 00:42:55.865
What I gave Hanxiao's family
was tribute silver.

00:42:56.465 --> 00:42:58.745
The moment it hits the market,
someone will report it.

00:42:58.825 --> 00:43:00.745
The money will come back fast.

00:43:00.825 --> 00:43:03.145
So these letters didn't cost anything.

00:43:07.505 --> 00:43:09.705
I checked both the Capital Prefecture
and Chang'an County offices.

00:43:09.785 --> 00:43:11.785
In the past half year,
there's no record of Hanxiao registering.

00:43:13.785 --> 00:43:15.145
She left the palace,

00:43:15.225 --> 00:43:16.665
yet her body ended up back inside.

00:43:17.265 --> 00:43:19.745
Looks like the killer
can move freely in the palace,

00:43:19.825 --> 00:43:21.225
go anywhere without suspicion,

00:43:21.305 --> 00:43:22.825
and even come and go from the palace.

00:43:22.905 --> 00:43:25.145
What kind of status would that be?

00:43:25.225 --> 00:43:27.225
And they can hide a body in the harem.

00:43:28.705 --> 00:43:30.665
Mr. Xiao has the qilin badge.
He could do it.

00:43:33.465 --> 00:43:34.905
Or maybe it's not someone important,

00:43:34.985 --> 00:43:37.425
but someone low enough
that no one notices them.

00:43:39.425 --> 00:43:40.785
Did you spread the word I told you to?

00:43:40.865 --> 00:43:42.025
I did.

00:43:42.105 --> 00:43:43.545
Hanxiao got along with people.

00:43:43.625 --> 00:43:45.065
Hearing she died so horribly,

00:43:45.145 --> 00:43:46.625
some palace maid
will surely come with clues.

00:43:46.705 --> 00:43:49.665
Didn't His Majesty
order a quiet investigation

00:43:49.745 --> 00:43:51.105
to avoid panic?

00:43:52.105 --> 00:43:54.265
His Majesty also ordered we solve it fast.

00:43:57.825 --> 00:43:58.705
I'm done eating.

00:43:58.785 --> 00:44:00.225
Let's go back to the Palace
Investigation Bureau and wait.

00:44:01.985 --> 00:44:03.385
We already have a lead so soon.

00:44:05.705 --> 00:44:07.105
Your Ladyship, blessings.

00:44:07.665 --> 00:44:09.905
I'm Qingquan from Consort Shu's palace.

00:44:10.505 --> 00:44:11.345
I…

00:44:13.145 --> 00:44:15.145
I know who killed Hanxiao!
