00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.660
=My Greatest Danger Is You=

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.930
Che,

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.470
this matter ends here.

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:52.216
Do not bring ruin upon the whole tribe.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.200
But...

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.390
There is no but.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.280
Between the tribe and Wu Zhaoli,

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.400
you must make

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.710
a choice today.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.310
(Perhaps cutting ties with me)

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.560
(is good for Che.)

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.790
(At least in the future,)

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:21.790
(he won't have to struggle anymore.)

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.120
Your goal has been achieved.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.150
We can leave now.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.350
Fine.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.819
Since you don't wish to stay here,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.960
let's go.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.350
From this day on,

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.200
Wu Zhaoli of the Wuyue tribe

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.230
will no longer be your wife.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.840
Luo Cheng.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:41.710
Yes.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.200
Yan Che, take the decree.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.270
Ying Du,

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.787
I never thought you'd care so much
for Zhaoli.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.430
I was just troubled
about finding your weakness.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.120
Ying Du,

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.910
this seat

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.520
should be shared by you and me.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.310
Why is

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.470
the one by your side now

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.590
someone else?

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:57.590
Ye Li.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.750
Who are you?

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.750
Your Highness,

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.710
you're right.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.560
The one meant to stand beside him
should have been you.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:11.630
What do you want?

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.030
I want

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.560
to help you regain

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.280
what was lost.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.080
You want to turn me against the ruler?

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.800
I'll never agree to that.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.520
He is my elder brother.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.560
Yet you share no blood ties with him,

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.430
do you?

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.120
Your heart has long been devoted to him,

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.750
yet you can only watch helplessly

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.190
as others take that place beside him.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.910
I truly feel all these years

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.000
of devotion are undeserved.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.560
Are you truly willing to let it go?

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.910
I dislike seeing other women near him,

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.710
but it is his choice to make.

00:03:43.887 --> 00:03:45.187
All I wish is for his well-being.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:46.750
Then, do you realize

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.240
Wu Zhaoli is Saintess Xihe?

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.240
The Saintess is bound by fate.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.750
She must never fall in love.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.680
Otherwise, fate will punish her.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.030
When that happens,

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.680
Ying Du's soul will also shatter

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.030
because of her.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.590
The ruler

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.120
will lose his soul

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.000
for that woman?

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.030
(In my second life,)

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:12.213
(it feels like everything has changed.)

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.120
(Ying Du bears deep hostility
toward Che.)

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.070
(He keeps saying that Che will harm me.)

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.120
(Che seems burdened)

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.560
(with secrets he cannot share.)

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.830
(Everlasting Joy)
(What happened back then?)

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.230
Oracle,

00:04:38.241 --> 00:04:39.887
(Oracle)
do you know the Fengwu Bracelet?

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.430
The Bracelet is an ancient treasure.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.190
It can turn back time.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.160
(As long as I get the Bracelet,)

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.120
(I can uncover why he slew)

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.800
(Grandmother and the entire tribe.)

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.920
Ying Du.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:00.590
Ying Du?

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.837
(That's the wound
I stabbed him with that day.)

00:05:21.703 --> 00:05:23.470
(Doesn't he have the power
to heal himself?)

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.390
(Why has it still not mended?)

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:27.680
(Forget it.)

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.360
(I'll find the Bracelet first.)

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.160
Why weren't you affected
by my calming incense?

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.000
Zhaoli,

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.630
whatever you're thinking,

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.040
don't dig any deeper.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.190
The more you know,
the greater the danger.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.430
My greatest danger is you.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.160
What exactly are you hiding from me?

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.480
Why won't you say anything?

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.230
Zhaoli,

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.560
you only need to remember

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.920
that no matter what, I'll keep you safe.

00:06:03.183 --> 00:06:04.376
What's happening to your hand?

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.720
Are you worried about me?

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:08.720
Of course not.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.560
Who said I'd worry about you?

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.510
(The Frostbite Curse
is striking more often.)

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.600
(It seems I won't last much longer.)

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.750
(I must repair the Bracelet soon.)

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:25.920
(That way, even if I'm gone,)

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.510
(the Bracelet can still protect Zhaoli.)

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:41.230
Your Majesty,

00:06:41.453 --> 00:06:43.166
Yan Che has begun to act,
just as expected.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.000
He met Ye Li in secret last night.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.600
Find out what they're after.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:50.670
Yes.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.640
Your Majesty,

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:57.720
your Frostbite Curse is worsening.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.480
The Frost Seal is fading fast.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.800
If you keep draining your power,
you may not survive.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.640
It's nothing.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.600
(The Bracelet.)

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:07.920
(I found it.)

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:21.720
What are you doing?

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:24.710
(Ying Du,)

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.546
(since you refuse to say anything,)

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:28.160
(I'll find out)

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:30.390
(what danger you were talking about.)

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.390
Could it be because it's damaged

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:51.150
that it shows no reaction?

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:12.750
I wonder if Oracle can help

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:13.750
awaken the Bracelet.
