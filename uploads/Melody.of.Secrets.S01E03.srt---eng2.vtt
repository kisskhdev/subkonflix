WEBVTT

00:00:00.105 --> 00:00:01.361
I will prove to you

00:00:01.385 --> 00:00:03.665
that this Tankhun is a fake one.

00:00:03.697 --> 00:00:06.089
And approached you because he wants something.

00:00:06.113 --> 00:00:08.689
Why does everyone act like my life is theirs?

00:00:50.685 --> 00:00:51.897
Oh, Tankhun.

00:00:53.195 --> 00:00:54.195
You’re up?

00:00:56.845 --> 00:00:57.845
Hey.

00:00:58.285 --> 00:01:00.521
Don’t make a face as if I defiled you.

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:03.529
It’s you who invaded my sleeping space.

00:01:06.715 --> 00:01:07.715
So…

00:01:12.675 --> 00:01:13.755
Are you feeling better now?

00:01:23.095 --> 00:01:24.577
Why do I feel weird?

00:01:26.105 --> 00:01:27.105
Tankhun!

00:01:27.435 --> 00:01:28.435
Tankhun!

00:01:29.065 --> 00:01:30.481
Here you go. Some medicines.

00:01:35.965 --> 00:01:37.281
Are you sure

00:01:38.605 --> 00:01:40.005
you don’t have to go to the doctor?

00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:43.005
Yeah.

00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:47.365
I should be okay after some antihistamines.

00:01:48.595 --> 00:01:50.161
You’re allergic to cassava?

00:01:50.185 --> 00:01:52.657
Uncooked cassava is naturally toxic.

00:01:52.915 --> 00:01:54.729
I was in a hurry to see you

00:01:54.777 --> 00:01:56.913
so I might now have cooked it through.

00:01:57.175 --> 00:01:58.577
If you don’t believe me,

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:59.913
you can get me a cooked one.

00:01:59.945 --> 00:02:00.945
I’ll eat it and show you

00:02:01.265 --> 00:02:03.449
so you know that I’m fine.

00:02:05.905 --> 00:02:07.985
I thought you were allergic,
so I threw them all out.

00:02:09.985 --> 00:02:12.425
You haven’t had water, right?

00:02:16.965 --> 00:02:18.633
The antihistamine I have at home

00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:20.161
makes you sleepy.

00:02:21.355 --> 00:02:22.993
I don’t want to fall asleep here.

00:02:28.445 --> 00:02:29.817
The antihistamine you have at home

00:02:30.305 --> 00:02:31.305
is strong indeed.

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:35.113
You’re lucky

00:02:35.725 --> 00:02:37.289
that no one is home

00:02:37.735 --> 00:02:39.137
so you could stay the night.

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:40.809
Hey.

00:02:41.385 --> 00:02:42.833
Get washed up already.

00:02:43.275 --> 00:02:44.833
Before my grandmother comes.

00:02:47.685 --> 00:02:49.281
Am I your secret now?

00:02:53.913 --> 00:02:55.915
I’d rather you be my truth.

00:02:58.365 --> 00:03:00.873
The truth that no one
can take you away from me.

00:03:41.845 --> 00:03:42.633
Yeah?

00:03:42.665 --> 00:03:43.969
(We need to talk.)

00:03:43.993 --> 00:03:45.009
(I’ll call you back.)

00:03:45.385 --> 00:03:46.737
You’re with him, right?

00:03:47.273 --> 00:03:48.961
Yeah, why?

00:03:48.993 --> 00:03:50.617
Kick him out.

00:03:51.475 --> 00:03:52.593
What are you talking about?

00:03:53.085 --> 00:03:54.805
Just hurry up and say what you want to say.

00:03:55.195 --> 00:03:56.897
(The person who’s with you now)

00:03:56.913 --> 00:03:57.961
(is not Tankhun.)

00:03:57.985 --> 00:03:58.985
(He’s Thunphob.)

00:04:02.485 --> 00:04:04.377
Tankhun’s younger brother.

00:04:04.425 --> 00:04:07.033
(That’s why you couldn’t recognize him.)

00:04:07.385 --> 00:04:08.385
How did you know?

00:04:10.195 --> 00:04:11.593
Who are you talking to, Pleng?

00:04:12.015 --> 00:04:13.015
(Pleng!)

00:04:13.525 --> 00:04:14.525
(Pleng!)

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:16.889
Something about work.

00:04:19.155 --> 00:04:19.913
I see.

00:04:20.177 --> 00:04:21.177
Is this mine?

00:04:25.505 --> 00:04:26.505
No.

00:04:28.125 --> 00:04:29.561
Not yours.

00:06:04.445 --> 00:06:06.073
When you invited me for tea

00:06:06.505 --> 00:06:08.505
I didn’t think it would be this serious.

00:06:11.275 --> 00:06:12.313
My mom likes it.

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:15.165
I’ve been making her one every day.

00:06:16.785 --> 00:06:19.225
She even sulked at me when I didn’t.

00:06:19.425 --> 00:06:21.257
It’s tough being an only child.

00:06:22.165 --> 00:06:23.793
That’s why I want a sibling.

00:06:24.495 --> 00:06:26.081
So my mom can put it on someone else.

00:06:27.125 --> 00:06:28.353
What about you?

00:06:29.955 --> 00:06:31.153
Do you have any siblings?

00:06:32.065 --> 00:06:33.065
I do.

00:06:33.475 --> 00:06:34.857
But we haven’t talked in a while.

00:06:35.435 --> 00:06:36.449
Are you guys not close?

00:06:41.285 --> 00:06:42.617
You can tell me.

00:06:43.115 --> 00:06:44.915
I want to know how it feels to have siblings.

00:06:45.485 --> 00:06:47.281
Just kids who grew up together.

00:06:48.315 --> 00:06:49.609
Nothing interesting.

00:06:52.135 --> 00:06:53.241
Your tea

00:06:56.045 --> 00:06:57.209
is even more interesting.

00:07:25.975 --> 00:07:26.985
Try it.

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.285
See if it deserves your interest.

00:07:46.895 --> 00:07:48.073
My family’s ritual.

00:07:49.585 --> 00:07:51.209
You have to have tea with cookies.

00:07:52.605 --> 00:07:55.057
(Just knew that Tankhun has
a mild allergy to nuts.)

00:07:55.765 --> 00:07:57.085
(He will throw up if he has one.)

00:08:15.535 --> 00:08:16.535
Pleng.

00:08:18.105 --> 00:08:19.105
Yes?

00:08:21.035 --> 00:08:22.473
If you weren’t a journalist

00:08:22.805 --> 00:08:24.289
you could open up a tea cafe.

00:08:24.321 --> 00:08:25.321
It’s really good.

00:08:27.325 --> 00:08:29.577
(You’re really not Tankhun?)

00:08:38.615 --> 00:08:39.615
Pleng!

00:08:39.925 --> 00:08:40.925
The cookie…

00:08:41.145 --> 00:08:42.537
Are there nuts in it?

00:08:43.285 --> 00:08:44.285
Uh…

00:08:46.285 --> 00:08:47.521
I don’t know.

00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:48.569
Why?

00:08:49.565 --> 00:08:50.345
I’m allergic to nuts.

00:08:50.377 --> 00:08:51.817
This one’s real. I’m not pretending.

00:08:54.965 --> 00:08:55.965
Tankhun!

00:08:57.521 --> 00:08:58.521
Yes!

00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:02.697
Oh!

00:09:03.135 --> 00:09:04.135
Tankhun!

00:09:07.845 --> 00:09:10.225
(I don’t know where you get your info)

00:09:10.265 --> 00:09:12.721
(but I’m sure he’s the real Tankhun.)

00:09:16.595 --> 00:09:17.595
Are you okay?

00:09:18.245 --> 00:09:19.605
Do you need to go to the hospital?

00:09:22.525 --> 00:09:23.525
It’s alright.

00:09:24.955 --> 00:09:26.721
I already had some antihistamine.

00:09:27.585 --> 00:09:29.273
I guess it’s still working.

00:09:37.895 --> 00:09:38.895
Come here.

00:09:51.185 --> 00:09:52.505
Shall I call a doctor in?

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:55.265
It’s okay.

00:09:55.297 --> 00:09:56.497
I’m not that sick.

00:09:58.495 --> 00:09:59.495
Look.

00:10:00.505 --> 00:10:01.929
Don’t make me feel like

00:10:01.945 --> 00:10:03.665
you’d always be unlucky around me.

00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:07.315
I’m actually lucky to have you.

00:10:12.665 --> 00:10:13.665
Thank you.

00:10:14.165 --> 00:10:15.673
For caring so much about me.

00:10:21.753 --> 00:10:22.817
Then…

00:10:24.725 --> 00:10:26.329
Shall we have the doctor examine you?

00:10:26.915 --> 00:10:28.075
In case there’s anything bad.

00:10:32.605 --> 00:10:33.605
Hey!

00:10:34.555 --> 00:10:36.033
I’m not your doctor.

00:10:36.555 --> 00:10:37.809
You’re quite cheeky.

00:10:41.945 --> 00:10:43.289
I actually

00:10:43.321 --> 00:10:44.825
have a personal doctor.

00:10:46.005 --> 00:10:47.745
Why do you need a personal doctor?

00:10:51.445 --> 00:10:52.873
That’s my secret.

00:11:11.765 --> 00:11:13.097
Mom is the only one

00:11:13.525 --> 00:11:14.737
who knows about my secrets

00:11:15.417 --> 00:11:16.857
and our relationship.

00:11:17.857 --> 00:11:19.855
But she has been in a coma for a long time.

00:11:22.665 --> 00:11:23.665
Then I…

00:11:25.925 --> 00:11:27.657
I’m your secret, indeed.

00:11:28.545 --> 00:11:29.545
Yes.

00:11:31.655 --> 00:11:32.833
You’re a secret.

00:11:35.215 --> 00:11:37.609
But a secret I want to unravel.

00:11:40.405 --> 00:11:42.977
I lost you along with my memory.

00:11:46.415 --> 00:11:47.977
But I will find it.

00:11:57.795 --> 00:11:59.521
Then hurry up and find me.

00:12:09.205 --> 00:12:10.205
You know what?

00:12:10.685 --> 00:12:12.065
During university,

00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:14.865
my mom would drive me around every day.

00:12:16.155 --> 00:12:18.609
My friends even called me a mama boy.

00:12:18.633 --> 00:12:20.605
I was so embarrassed.

00:12:21.615 --> 00:12:23.409
I wanted to look up “new mom near me”.

00:12:26.993 --> 00:12:28.995
But after mom got into an accident

00:12:29.875 --> 00:12:31.761
and fall into a coma like this…

00:12:35.395 --> 00:12:37.041
I’d rather she’s not sick

00:12:37.481 --> 00:12:39.485
and drive me around for the rest of my life.

00:12:39.755 --> 00:12:41.585
Your mom probably loves you dearly.

00:12:47.473 --> 00:12:48.529
Can you believe it?

00:12:49.505 --> 00:12:51.353
I’ve never gone clubbing.

00:12:52.505 --> 00:12:55.105
Mom was always with me wherever I went.

00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:56.817
Don’t know why she’d be so worried.

00:13:02.325 --> 00:13:03.681
Then do you want to go with me?

00:13:06.365 --> 00:13:08.425
Do you mean now?

00:13:08.655 --> 00:13:09.655
Yeah.

00:13:10.045 --> 00:13:11.785
Right here, right now.

00:13:42.633 --> 00:13:44.113
(What sort of power does he possess?)

00:13:44.561 --> 00:13:46.565
(It makes my body feel so light.)

00:13:48.385 --> 00:13:49.801
(As if I can fly.)

00:13:55.805 --> 00:13:57.689
(If I can wish anything from god, )

00:13:58.275 --> 00:14:00.417
(apart from mom’s recovery)

00:14:07.135 --> 00:14:09.873
(I wish I could remember Tankhun forever.)

00:14:16.145 --> 00:14:17.713
(Never forget him again.)

00:14:34.225 --> 00:14:35.225
I feel like

00:14:36.335 --> 00:14:37.897
my heart is beating so hard.

00:14:41.795 --> 00:14:43.393
Your cheeks are so red.

00:14:44.525 --> 00:14:45.817
Are you allergic to anything?

00:14:55.045 --> 00:14:56.417
I just found what I’m allergic to.

00:14:58.825 --> 00:14:59.825
It’s you.

00:15:05.635 --> 00:15:06.635
Yeah?

00:15:09.681 --> 00:15:11.673
Well then…

00:15:13.195 --> 00:15:15.961
You’ll have to use me as an antihistamine.

00:15:26.115 --> 00:15:28.537
Even if I can’t remember
what happened 10 years ago,

00:15:29.075 --> 00:15:30.075
But I think

00:15:31.705 --> 00:15:33.505
I’ve made new memories.

00:15:36.735 --> 00:15:37.737
I think

00:15:40.569 --> 00:15:41.801
I like you.

00:15:43.945 --> 00:15:45.481
Will you please never be gone again?

00:16:03.485 --> 00:16:04.485
Um…

00:16:04.575 --> 00:16:05.961
I’m sorry once again

00:16:06.905 --> 00:16:08.281
about the cookie with nuts.

00:16:10.009 --> 00:16:11.009
It’s alright.

00:16:11.057 --> 00:16:12.241
You didn’t know.

00:16:12.289 --> 00:16:13.561
If you did and still do it,

00:16:13.585 --> 00:16:14.785
that’s when I should be angry.

00:16:18.575 --> 00:16:20.801
Still, it’s a cookie from my house.

00:16:21.017 --> 00:16:22.545
I should have asked you first.

00:16:24.805 --> 00:16:26.481
It won’t happen again.

00:16:28.577 --> 00:16:29.601
I promise.

00:16:31.913 --> 00:16:33.915
(Because you are actually Tankhun.)

00:16:47.915 --> 00:16:50.481
Tankhun was allergic to nuts like the diary said

00:16:50.913 --> 00:16:52.915
so you just believed him?

00:16:53.295 --> 00:16:54.369
With that face,

00:16:54.835 --> 00:16:55.985
you probably don’t trust me.

00:16:56.265 --> 00:17:00.089
Being allergic to nuts is not a great secret.

00:17:00.125 --> 00:17:01.217
If he’s really Tankhun’s younger brother

00:17:01.233 --> 00:17:02.645
pretending to be him,

00:17:03.285 --> 00:17:04.665
then he should have known it.

00:17:06.081 --> 00:17:08.085
But you believe the undercover plot, huh?

00:17:11.165 --> 00:17:13.297
Because there’s a sound reason

00:17:13.473 --> 00:17:15.985
that Thunphob is pretending to be Tankhun.

00:17:17.985 --> 00:17:18.985
What are you on about?

00:17:28.125 --> 00:17:29.353
Check this out.

00:17:31.255 --> 00:17:33.001
Jennaree Rongsomphong.

00:17:33.033 --> 00:17:34.233
I’ve just interviewed her

00:17:34.649 --> 00:17:36.645
and sneakily asked about her family.

00:17:37.455 --> 00:17:39.049
But she wouldn’t talk about it

00:17:39.555 --> 00:17:41.155
and even avoided answering the question.

00:17:42.245 --> 00:17:43.305
That’s so suspicious.

00:17:43.935 --> 00:17:45.535
Looked like she’s keeping a secret, too.

00:17:47.153 --> 00:17:49.755
Maybe she just didn’t want your nose
in her personal life.

00:17:53.475 --> 00:17:54.993
Then have a read by yourself.

00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:56.137
Perhaps you can see light.

00:18:03.005 --> 00:18:04.233
“Wish fulfilled.”

00:18:04.795 --> 00:18:06.977
“The Rongsomphong family thrilled”

00:18:07.275 --> 00:18:08.705
“when Thunphob Rongsomphong”

00:18:08.745 --> 00:18:10.937
“is accepted into the criminology department”

00:18:10.969 --> 00:18:13.089
“at the University of Staffordshire. ”

00:18:14.025 --> 00:18:16.865
“He’s preparing to be a criminologist
following his father’s footsteps.”

00:18:17.155 --> 00:18:19.241
“While Tankhun Rongsomphong”

00:18:19.505 --> 00:18:22.681
“made it into the faculty of medicine
at University College London.”

00:18:23.445 --> 00:18:25.193
“Looking forward to finding out”

00:18:25.217 --> 00:18:28.081
“which brother Jennaree,
the youngest daughter, will resemble.”

00:18:33.995 --> 00:18:35.601
If you still don’t believe me,

00:18:36.113 --> 00:18:38.115
you’ll have to find out the answer yourself.

00:18:46.521 --> 00:18:48.081
VICTIMS.

00:18:48.105 --> 00:18:50.489
The link between the two victims is

00:18:51.025 --> 00:18:53.025
both used to work for the Thayadon family.

00:18:54.321 --> 00:18:56.325
One worked for Botpleng’s mom.

00:18:56.825 --> 00:18:58.825
One worked for Botpleng’s dad.

00:18:59.645 --> 00:19:00.645
What do you think?

00:19:00.745 --> 00:19:02.233
The murderer picked the victims

00:19:02.795 --> 00:19:04.251
who have worked for the Thayadon family.

00:19:04.275 --> 00:19:05.017
Reasons?

00:19:05.289 --> 00:19:07.285
From the fact that the bodies were shown off,

00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:08.673
there could be 4 main reasons.

00:19:09.205 --> 00:19:11.409
One, for revenge or to humiliate the victims.

00:19:11.995 --> 00:19:13.753
Two, for attention.

00:19:13.777 --> 00:19:15.097
Projecting power to the public.

00:19:16.125 --> 00:19:19.057
Three, to tear the victim’s dignity and worth.

00:19:19.775 --> 00:19:22.137
Four, for fame.

00:19:22.535 --> 00:19:24.177
Then I’ll start with the grudge.

00:19:24.405 --> 00:19:26.673
I’ll dig into what sort of work
the Thayadons do

00:19:26.697 --> 00:19:28.675
that could make the murderer feel vengeful.

00:19:29.085 --> 00:19:30.089
Just the Thayadon family?

00:19:34.555 --> 00:19:36.745
You think Botpleng discovering the body

00:19:36.777 --> 00:19:37.953
was a coincidence?

00:19:38.985 --> 00:19:41.753
There has been news about the Thayadons
in the past

00:19:41.777 --> 00:19:44.633
But it would be impossible to find out now

00:19:44.945 --> 00:19:47.049
because Petchkla Thayadon, Botpleng’s dad,

00:19:47.073 --> 00:19:48.241
is now dead.

00:19:48.605 --> 00:19:52.289
Khitakan Thayadon is unwell now.

00:19:53.065 --> 00:19:54.473
She’s in a coma.

00:19:56.475 --> 00:19:58.009
There’s only the heir left.

00:19:58.365 --> 00:19:59.365
What about that?

00:19:59.605 --> 00:20:00.609
Or would you…

00:20:01.685 --> 00:20:03.353
Sneakily ask your boyfriend about it?

00:20:08.465 --> 00:20:10.121
There’s no point trying to ask him.

00:20:10.365 --> 00:20:11.737
Botpleng lost his memory.

00:20:13.365 --> 00:20:15.085
You’re not even denying the boyfriend part.

00:20:22.255 --> 00:20:23.457
DISTRUST.

00:20:31.125 --> 00:20:32.505
FEARFUL / BRAVE / IMPATIENT / CHEERFUL

00:20:32.529 --> 00:20:34.009
PANIC / SENSITIVE

00:20:34.033 --> 00:20:35.273
MULTI-PERSONALITY / MEMORY LOSS

00:20:37.233 --> 00:20:38.489
DISTRUST.

00:20:39.065 --> 00:20:40.121
I think

00:20:42.017 --> 00:20:43.265
I like you.

00:20:45.935 --> 00:20:46.889
LIKE.

00:20:46.913 --> 00:20:48.913
MULTI-PERSONALITY / MEMORY LOSS /
PANIC / SENSITIVE

00:20:57.275 --> 00:20:58.275
Inspector.

00:21:02.335 --> 00:21:03.335
Well.

00:21:04.035 --> 00:21:05.553
I’m here to apologize.

00:21:06.615 --> 00:21:08.105
What happened the other day,

00:21:08.153 --> 00:21:09.505
I think I crossed the line.

00:21:09.985 --> 00:21:11.545
Only caring about the journalist’s role

00:21:12.065 --> 00:21:14.489
that I forgot the police
have their responsibility too.

00:21:17.049 --> 00:21:18.081
I’m sorry.

00:21:20.875 --> 00:21:22.201
Did Tankhun ask you to come?

00:21:23.215 --> 00:21:24.401
Why do you think so?

00:21:24.885 --> 00:21:26.649
Because you left with Tankhun that day.

00:21:27.793 --> 00:21:29.795
He was part of what made me realize.

00:21:30.235 --> 00:21:31.281
But I’m here today

00:21:31.635 --> 00:21:33.329
because I personally want to apologize.

00:21:35.633 --> 00:21:37.635
Then I’ll accept your apology.

00:21:38.175 --> 00:21:40.881
Let’s do our best in each of
our responsibilities from now on.

00:21:41.545 --> 00:21:42.745
We owe each other nothing now.

00:21:49.065 --> 00:21:50.585
That’s not all why you’re here, is it?

00:21:51.295 --> 00:21:52.889
I want to ask you about Tankhun.

00:21:55.125 --> 00:21:56.753
Can you spare some time?

00:22:10.235 --> 00:22:11.265
Sorry,

00:22:11.305 --> 00:22:12.865
for making Mr. Preppy have a hard time.

00:22:13.795 --> 00:22:15.049
I’m not having a hard time.

00:22:15.685 --> 00:22:17.305
And I’m not preppy.

00:22:18.285 --> 00:22:19.929
You don’t have to downplay it.

00:22:20.241 --> 00:22:22.245
Your last name screams wealth.

00:22:25.405 --> 00:22:27.665
So why did you become a journalist?

00:22:28.395 --> 00:22:29.395
You enjoy it?

00:22:30.725 --> 00:22:31.897
More than just enjoying it.

00:22:33.097 --> 00:22:35.095
I feel the need to become a journalist

00:22:35.129 --> 00:22:36.649
to clear the bad news about my dad.

00:22:38.645 --> 00:22:40.697
But don’t you have my information already?

00:22:41.849 --> 00:22:43.845
You probably knew my dad is infamous.

00:22:45.715 --> 00:22:47.793
But I believe my dad didn’t do that.

00:22:49.137 --> 00:22:51.135
I will definitely clear the bad news for him.

00:22:51.535 --> 00:22:52.535
Yeah.

00:22:53.565 --> 00:22:55.137
You’re a journalist now.

00:22:56.325 --> 00:22:57.401
Why don’t you fix it?

00:23:01.605 --> 00:23:02.945
Or do you not have any proof?

00:23:05.645 --> 00:23:07.097
I just can’t find them yet.

00:23:07.729 --> 00:23:09.185
If you can’t find them yet,

00:23:09.835 --> 00:23:11.369
don’t blame yourself.

00:23:12.705 --> 00:23:14.481
As far as I have dealt with the cases,

00:23:14.975 --> 00:23:16.441
even the person we love

00:23:16.775 --> 00:23:18.337
and no matter how much we trust them.

00:23:19.209 --> 00:23:21.205
They still can do things you never imagined.

00:23:29.515 --> 00:23:30.515
Sorry.

00:23:30.705 --> 00:23:32.473
Did I make you feel discouraged?

00:23:33.435 --> 00:23:35.601
Let’s talk about your topic instead.

00:23:37.505 --> 00:23:39.105
What did you want to know about Tankhun?

00:23:40.325 --> 00:23:41.609
I want to know

00:23:42.985 --> 00:23:43.889
how Tankhun became involved

00:23:43.913 --> 00:23:45.593
in the case that I found the body.

00:23:53.465 --> 00:23:55.465
(Inspector Dao said Tankhun is good.)

00:23:55.497 --> 00:23:57.465
(He was at the right place at the right time.)

00:23:57.529 --> 00:23:59.249
(So she invited him to join the case.)

00:23:59.273 --> 00:24:00.793
(She wouldn’t slip out anything else.)

00:24:01.205 --> 00:24:02.485
(What are you going to do next?)

00:24:03.085 --> 00:24:04.085
(Keep going.)

00:24:07.535 --> 00:24:08.535
Hey!

00:24:12.425 --> 00:24:13.777
Don’t die yet.

00:24:13.793 --> 00:24:15.569
You haven’t set your dad’s reputation right.

00:24:16.635 --> 00:24:17.977
To cross the street in this country,

00:24:17.993 --> 00:24:19.673
just checking the red light is not enough.

00:24:19.885 --> 00:24:21.713
Even the drivers don’t bat an eye.

00:24:22.057 --> 00:24:23.417
Watch out next time.

00:24:24.235 --> 00:24:25.235
Yes.

00:24:25.295 --> 00:24:26.497
Thank you, inspector.

00:24:27.275 --> 00:24:28.881
Then please excuse me.

00:24:39.525 --> 00:24:40.553
Hello, Lt. Nim?

00:24:41.215 --> 00:24:42.481
I told you to find out about Botpleng’s dad.

00:24:42.505 --> 00:24:43.505
How is it going?

00:24:45.175 --> 00:24:48.265
Then dig up more about his infamous news.

00:24:48.785 --> 00:24:49.833
Dig deep.

00:24:50.401 --> 00:24:51.689
Be as detailed as possible.

00:24:56.655 --> 00:24:57.655
Yeah.

00:25:03.225 --> 00:25:04.225
Yeah.

00:25:04.565 --> 00:25:05.857
Let’s talk later.

00:25:05.881 --> 00:25:06.921
I have to go.

00:25:15.435 --> 00:25:16.513
Surprised?

00:25:17.995 --> 00:25:20.209
I feel like dining with you

00:25:20.685 --> 00:25:21.685
so I came.

00:25:23.485 --> 00:25:25.281
I’ll be your chef today.

00:25:26.585 --> 00:25:27.665
Is it okay?

00:25:28.873 --> 00:25:30.875
I didn’t let you know the time beforehand.

00:25:33.245 --> 00:25:34.245
It’s alright.

00:25:37.135 --> 00:25:38.817
I have something to ask you.

00:25:40.885 --> 00:25:41.885
Yes?

00:25:43.485 --> 00:25:46.537
Why did you ask Inspector Dao about me?

00:25:53.405 --> 00:25:54.497
I just wanted to know about you

00:25:54.513 --> 00:25:56.057
from the other’s perspective.

00:25:58.285 --> 00:25:59.777
So what did you find out?

00:26:02.535 --> 00:26:04.337
You’ve already talked to Inspector Dao.

00:26:04.353 --> 00:26:05.513
Why bother asking me?

00:26:06.365 --> 00:26:08.033
I’m curious, so I’m asking you.

00:26:08.065 --> 00:26:10.225
Or do you want me to ask
the people around you instead?

00:26:14.255 --> 00:26:15.255
Nice sarcasm.

00:26:19.355 --> 00:26:20.761
Inspector Dao only said that

00:26:20.809 --> 00:26:22.369
you got to handle my case

00:26:22.775 --> 00:26:24.393
because you’re good, that’s it.

00:26:28.185 --> 00:26:29.185
Yeah.

00:26:29.575 --> 00:26:30.575
I’m good.

00:26:31.495 --> 00:26:33.057
I took up the case because of you.

00:26:33.737 --> 00:26:35.735
Mainly because I wanted to help you.

00:26:36.615 --> 00:26:37.833
One more thing.

00:26:41.065 --> 00:26:42.737
Who would ever let their first love

00:26:43.475 --> 00:26:45.001
go through such a dreadful case alone?

00:26:52.315 --> 00:26:53.315
You’re such a talker.

00:26:57.561 --> 00:26:57.937
Here.

00:26:58.305 --> 00:26:59.305
Urgh!

00:26:59.695 --> 00:27:00.841
Hey! Sorry.

00:27:00.857 --> 00:27:01.857
Ouch!

00:27:02.665 --> 00:27:03.337
Open your mouth.

00:27:03.353 --> 00:27:03.809
Ouch!

00:27:03.825 --> 00:27:05.425
Open your mouth, I will blow it for you.

00:27:07.105 --> 00:27:08.121
Open your mouth.

00:27:13.815 --> 00:27:14.865
Feeling better?

00:27:26.565 --> 00:27:28.401
Drink up so it will stop burning.

00:27:29.005 --> 00:27:30.057
That’s a sauce.

00:27:33.833 --> 00:27:34.833
Here.

00:27:49.935 --> 00:27:50.935
Look.

00:27:55.965 --> 00:27:57.033
Can I ask for a favor?

00:28:02.155 --> 00:28:03.155
What is it?

00:28:04.585 --> 00:28:05.585
Tonight

00:28:06.115 --> 00:28:07.465
can I sleep with you?

00:28:23.215 --> 00:28:24.225
I just want to

00:28:25.485 --> 00:28:27.081
relive the memory.

00:28:50.805 --> 00:28:51.805
Hey.

00:28:52.035 --> 00:28:53.529
Just in case you misunderstood.

00:28:54.285 --> 00:28:55.985
By asking to sleep with you

00:28:56.817 --> 00:28:59.633
I meant holding hands to sleep like that day.

00:29:02.377 --> 00:29:04.375
What if I say no?

00:29:35.565 --> 00:29:36.565
Just kidding.

00:29:37.273 --> 00:29:39.275
I won’t do anything without your consent.

00:29:40.705 --> 00:29:42.417
If you want to hold hands to sleep,

00:29:44.415 --> 00:29:45.705
I will hold your hand all night.

00:30:04.273 --> 00:30:05.425
I won’t let go of you.

00:30:35.465 --> 00:30:36.633
Aren’t you sleepy?

00:30:37.295 --> 00:30:38.441
I’m a night owl.

00:30:39.045 --> 00:30:40.805
If you’re sleepy, then just go on and sleep.

00:30:40.835 --> 00:30:42.017
I won’t let go.

00:30:46.015 --> 00:30:47.825
I’m the one holding your hand.

00:30:48.415 --> 00:30:49.895
It’s you who’s only holding the book.

00:31:08.505 --> 00:31:09.753
Now I’m holding you only.

00:31:10.245 --> 00:31:11.353
Satisfied?

00:31:24.125 --> 00:31:25.125
What about this?

00:31:26.035 --> 00:31:27.035
Do you like it?

00:31:28.485 --> 00:31:29.805
You like it when someone rubs it.

00:31:31.165 --> 00:31:32.165
You remember?

00:31:34.145 --> 00:31:35.721
I could remember from the diary.

00:31:36.455 --> 00:31:38.721
Don’t know if you still like it like 10 years ago.

00:31:39.473 --> 00:31:41.475
I might like it even more.

00:32:37.115 --> 00:32:39.257
POLICE STATION

00:32:51.255 --> 00:32:53.265
The information about the Thayadon family.

00:32:54.415 --> 00:32:55.415
Thanks.

00:32:55.945 --> 00:32:57.785
What about the CCTV footage I asked for?

00:32:57.825 --> 00:32:58.337
Found anything?

00:32:58.377 --> 00:33:00.009
Already on the hard disk.

00:33:00.325 --> 00:33:01.385
Actually…

00:33:01.433 --> 00:33:03.177
With just a bike running the red light,

00:33:03.201 --> 00:33:04.769
I could just look into it for you.

00:33:05.489 --> 00:33:06.489
It’s alright.

00:33:06.553 --> 00:33:07.713
You can go back to your work.

00:33:40.875 --> 00:33:41.875
Tankhun.

00:33:47.785 --> 00:33:48.825
Tankhun.

00:33:58.593 --> 00:34:02.297
ENJOY YOUR MEAL.
I’LL BE RIGHT BACK.

00:34:12.585 --> 00:34:13.841
What’s your plan?

00:34:14.257 --> 00:34:16.255
I will make him trust me

00:34:16.525 --> 00:34:18.105
and get the secrets out of him.

00:34:18.515 --> 00:34:19.641
Get it right.

00:34:20.235 --> 00:34:21.633
Don’t forget he could be the fake one

00:34:21.657 --> 00:34:22.881
and is trying to use you.

00:35:13.835 --> 00:35:14.835
Doctor Jen.

00:35:15.045 --> 00:35:16.457
I have something to say to you.

00:35:16.785 --> 00:35:17.985
I’m not available.

00:35:18.675 --> 00:35:20.001
If you really want to talk,

00:35:20.041 --> 00:35:21.409
please make a reservation

00:35:21.433 --> 00:35:22.849
and don’t sneak up on me like this.

00:35:24.845 --> 00:35:26.645
You’re looking for your older brother, right?

00:35:27.445 --> 00:35:28.449
I know

00:35:28.835 --> 00:35:30.377
where Thunphob is.

00:35:32.375 --> 00:35:34.041
There’s no way you would know.

00:35:34.495 --> 00:35:36.081
And stop following me.

00:35:36.113 --> 00:35:37.401
Otherwise, I’ll call the police.

00:35:39.185 --> 00:35:42.289
(Mrs. Ounjai Kiawmana, age 75)

00:35:42.337 --> 00:35:43.697
(wearing a blue patient robe)

00:35:43.721 --> 00:35:45.695
(is missing from the patient room.)

00:35:45.729 --> 00:35:47.393
(If you see her,
please notify the staff immediately.)

00:35:47.417 --> 00:35:48.457
(Thank you.)

00:36:10.605 --> 00:36:12.097
Are you lost, Grandma?

00:36:16.285 --> 00:36:20.201
Not every old person is lost and forgetful.

00:36:21.025 --> 00:36:24.105
That means you’re not lost,

00:36:24.145 --> 00:36:25.865
but you ran away?

00:36:27.615 --> 00:36:30.097
Everyone inside is busy looking for you.

00:36:30.445 --> 00:36:32.225
Why bother looking for me?

00:36:32.249 --> 00:36:34.089
It’s good that I’m gone.

00:36:34.113 --> 00:36:37.593
So that my kids wouldn’t fight.

00:36:40.385 --> 00:36:42.385
When my parents were gone,

00:36:43.545 --> 00:36:45.289
I never thought it was good, Grandma.

00:36:45.625 --> 00:36:47.201
Your parents…

00:36:47.605 --> 00:36:48.769
It’s been many years ago.

00:36:50.385 --> 00:36:52.129
I still miss them every day.

00:36:52.985 --> 00:36:57.105
And I believe that your kids miss you, too.

00:36:58.705 --> 00:37:00.585
It’s better to solve problems together

00:37:00.937 --> 00:37:02.935
than avoiding it and being alone, Grandma.

00:37:04.145 --> 00:37:06.665
You can trust someone who’s been alone
for a long time like me!

00:37:07.049 --> 00:37:09.045
Then I’ll go check on them.

00:37:09.525 --> 00:37:11.585
See if they still fight.

00:37:13.225 --> 00:37:15.673
People only fight

00:37:15.705 --> 00:37:17.305
over something important.

00:37:17.705 --> 00:37:19.513
Then I am important?

00:37:19.537 --> 00:37:20.537
Yes.

00:37:20.915 --> 00:37:23.673
You should quickly get a girlfriend.

00:37:24.185 --> 00:37:25.825
So you won’t be lonely.

00:37:26.985 --> 00:37:27.985
Yes, Grandma.

00:37:30.695 --> 00:37:32.473
(Here you are, Grandma.)

00:37:32.521 --> 00:37:34.177
(We’ve been looking everywhere for you.)

00:37:36.155 --> 00:37:37.555
Let’s go. Be careful on your steps.

00:37:39.965 --> 00:37:41.657
Were you eavesdropping on me?

00:37:43.033 --> 00:37:45.257
Well, you were loud enough.

00:37:46.735 --> 00:37:47.841
But still…

00:37:48.615 --> 00:37:50.857
I’m sorry about your parents.

00:37:52.865 --> 00:37:54.249
Rest assured.

00:37:54.865 --> 00:37:56.185
My parents are alive and kicking.

00:37:58.085 --> 00:37:59.085
You…

00:37:59.255 --> 00:38:00.545
You lied to the grandma?

00:38:02.125 --> 00:38:03.649
It’s called a tactic

00:38:04.285 --> 00:38:05.785
to make people realize stuff.

00:38:07.875 --> 00:38:09.241
But about Thunphob,

00:38:09.745 --> 00:38:10.865
I’m telling the truth.

00:39:49.805 --> 00:39:50.953
Canon in D.

00:40:02.955 --> 00:40:03.961
Tankhun.

00:40:22.297 --> 00:40:25.489
THUNPHOB.

00:40:38.485 --> 00:40:39.865
I couldn’t remember you

00:40:42.335 --> 00:40:43.737
because you’re not Tankhun.

00:40:46.445 --> 00:40:48.081
You’re Thunphob, right?

00:40:55.385 --> 00:40:56.809
Why did you pretend to be Tankhun?

00:40:58.195 --> 00:40:59.681
I didn’t pretend to be Tankhun.

00:41:02.085 --> 00:41:03.085
What about this?

00:41:03.945 --> 00:41:04.945
What’s this?

00:41:05.673 --> 00:41:07.675
Why does the present you were to give me

00:41:07.713 --> 00:41:09.449
include Thunphob’s watch?

00:41:10.195 --> 00:41:11.195
Pleng.

00:41:13.465 --> 00:41:14.497
Listen to me.

00:41:15.445 --> 00:41:16.873
It’s not like that.

00:41:17.885 --> 00:41:19.289
You are Thunphob, right?

00:41:22.385 --> 00:41:23.609
Answer me.

00:41:25.605 --> 00:41:27.177
You are Thunphob, right?

00:41:28.125 --> 00:41:30.857
Pleng, listen to me.

00:41:31.295 --> 00:41:32.825
What are you going to lie to me next?

00:41:34.825 --> 00:41:35.873
Actually…

00:41:40.993 --> 00:41:42.233
Here is Thunphob

00:41:42.635 --> 00:41:43.777
your brother.

00:41:50.135 --> 00:41:51.135
No.

00:41:51.665 --> 00:41:53.153
That’s Tankhun.

00:41:56.815 --> 00:41:58.217
You’re Botpleng, right?

00:41:58.241 --> 00:41:59.241
Jen.

00:41:59.415 --> 00:42:01.561
He deserves to know the truth.

00:42:01.601 --> 00:42:02.705
What truth?

00:42:04.955 --> 00:42:05.857
Huh?

00:42:05.873 --> 00:42:07.153
What truth?

00:42:14.195 --> 00:42:15.195
Your lover

00:42:18.935 --> 00:42:19.953
is Thunphob.

00:42:22.725 --> 00:42:23.725
Not me.

00:42:31.805 --> 00:42:32.805
That bracelet.

00:42:35.405 --> 00:42:37.161
Thunphob really had it made for you.

00:42:43.095 --> 00:42:44.105
Before he died.

00:42:51.889 --> 00:42:52.889
Botpleng.

00:42:56.049 --> 00:42:57.049
I’m sorry.

00:43:02.115 --> 00:43:03.465
This is Thunphob.

00:43:04.135 --> 00:43:05.937
When we took the picture,

00:43:05.961 --> 00:43:08.441
he said he was going
to meet you in Thailand.

00:43:09.525 --> 00:43:11.073
Thunphob always told us

00:43:11.105 --> 00:43:12.833
that he fell in love with you here.

00:43:13.281 --> 00:43:15.285
You guys were each other’s first love.

00:43:17.505 --> 00:43:19.153
(I saw him)

00:43:19.177 --> 00:43:21.001
(after following the sound of the violin)

00:43:21.025 --> 00:43:22.697
(all the way to that tree.)

00:43:22.721 --> 00:43:23.721
Uh…

00:43:24.895 --> 00:43:25.895
Hi.

00:43:32.705 --> 00:43:34.705
(He said his name was “Tankhun”.)

00:43:35.925 --> 00:43:39.193
(We met in winter when we were 17.)

00:43:42.595 --> 00:43:45.705
(Tan made me enjoy the violin
for the first time.)

00:43:49.285 --> 00:43:51.513
(Just like getting to know love
for the first time.)

00:44:08.689 --> 00:44:10.121
He has always been here,

00:44:12.855 --> 00:44:14.425
while you were with me?

00:44:29.049 --> 00:44:31.045
Your sister said he loved me dearly.

00:44:34.555 --> 00:44:35.555
Yes.

00:44:42.845 --> 00:44:44.473
What Thunphob did wrong

00:44:48.165 --> 00:44:49.289
was using my name

00:44:52.035 --> 00:44:53.235
while he was in love with you.

00:44:59.015 --> 00:45:00.793
So what you did for me

00:45:02.795 --> 00:45:04.329
was because of Thunphob?

00:45:18.325 --> 00:45:19.325
I’m sorry.

00:45:26.177 --> 00:45:28.175
Considering what you have done for me,

00:45:32.175 --> 00:45:33.921
he probably loved me dearly.

00:45:45.035 --> 00:45:46.035
You know what?

00:45:50.505 --> 00:45:52.201
I’m not angry that you fooled me.

00:45:57.055 --> 00:45:58.721
But I’m angry right now

00:46:02.249 --> 00:46:03.689
because you made me love you.

00:46:29.275 --> 00:46:30.835
Do you really not feel anything at all?

00:46:31.035 --> 00:46:33.873
What I did was disgusting.

00:46:33.885 --> 00:46:36.305
If what you did was pretending to be Thunphob–

00:46:36.337 --> 00:46:37.521
I love Thunphob.

00:46:38.045 --> 00:46:39.545
Can I still do anything to make it right?

00:46:39.569 --> 00:46:41.545
What’s my body language telling you?
