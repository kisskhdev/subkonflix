WEBVTT

01:15.000 --> 01:17.120
During the 1980s

01:17.200 --> 01:20.410
the tribals love who lived
in Raigad's creek region

01:20.790 --> 01:23.830
Weren't aware of the value
of the black gold found in the creek.

01:24.120 --> 01:25.330
This black gold was nothing

01:25.410 --> 01:28.000
But the sand found in the depths
of the creek.

01:29.200 --> 01:31.660
Raigad's collector Kutta Swami Devi Gowda,

01:31.790 --> 01:33.660
who had been transferred

01:33.790 --> 01:35.450
from Karnataka.

01:36.040 --> 01:39.330
He was well aware of the value
of this black gold.

01:39.660 --> 01:42.500
During his tenure in the Raigad region

01:43.040 --> 01:46.580
he let the sand smuggling continue.

01:47.540 --> 01:51.620
But Pandhari Nath Tandel
of the Kopra village

01:51.910 --> 01:54.410
was well aware of this illegal activity.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.830
He gathered some villagers

01:56.910 --> 01:59.250
and mobbed the collector's office.

01:59.700 --> 02:01.290
The collector Kutta Swami

02:01.370 --> 02:04.290
and Pandhari Nath had a major showdown.

02:04.540 --> 02:06.950
A really honest and talented young man

02:07.040 --> 02:09.330
Of that village named Krishna Bhoir

02:09.789 --> 02:13.660
wasn't aware
of Kutta's illegal activities.

02:14.250 --> 02:16.330
He thought all this was happening

02:16.410 --> 02:18.450
for the development of the village.

02:19.160 --> 02:21.160
Under this impression, Krishna

02:21.250 --> 02:25.000
started fighting against his own people
defending Kutta Swami

02:26.120 --> 02:29.000
That mob included Pandhari Nath

02:29.080 --> 02:33.000
And his extremely beautiful daughter

02:33.330 --> 02:34.950
Charu Sheela.

02:35.620 --> 02:39.540
When the argument between Kutta Swami
and Pandhari Nath escalated

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
Charu used her fearlessness and wisdom.

02:44.080 --> 02:46.200
She exposed Kutta Swami

02:46.290 --> 02:48.200
And thus got her father released.

02:48.790 --> 02:53.160
Kutta Swami couldn't
bear this public humiliation.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.830
And thus began the battle
for the right of the land.

02:59.700 --> 03:01.790
But that battle

03:01.870 --> 03:03.870
was also the start of a love story.

03:04.370 --> 03:07.160
Shrimurli, Kutta Swami's son

03:07.370 --> 03:09.660
was watching all that from the car.

03:10.040 --> 03:13.200
Charu's fearlessness made him fall
in love with her.

03:13.790 --> 03:16.830
He was always against
his father's illegal activity.

03:17.250 --> 03:20.000
Shrimurli was so madly

03:20.080 --> 03:22.660
In love with Charu that

03:22.910 --> 03:25.000
That he would come to the village

03:25.080 --> 03:28.250
To catch a glimpse
of Charu under various disguises.

03:29.450 --> 03:31.910
Somewhere Charu was aware of it too.

03:33.290 --> 03:36.500
Slowly but surely Charu fell in love
with him too.

03:37.500 --> 03:42.370
But this love story that started
with this battle

03:42.830 --> 03:44.540
would end so tragically.

03:44.620 --> 03:47.450
Neither of them had imagined that.

03:50.250 --> 03:53.790
Charu and Shrimurli
who were madly in love

03:54.000 --> 03:57.330
meet each other on his birthday
at the river bank.

03:58.120 --> 04:00.250
Both are in their prime.

04:00.330 --> 04:02.540
And they get intimate unknowingly.

04:03.160 --> 04:07.290
Unfortunately Krishna Bhoir
happens to see that.

04:08.500 --> 04:11.700
The moment Krishna tells Kutta Swami
what he saw

04:11.830 --> 04:13.620
he gets enraged.

04:14.040 --> 04:16.160
He sends Shrimurli

04:16.250 --> 04:19.910
to their village in Karnataka citing
some excuse.

04:21.410 --> 04:23.160
The very next night

04:23.250 --> 04:26.160
Pandhari Nath dies
under mysterious circumstances.

04:26.660 --> 04:30.250
Charu gets suspicious.

04:30.790 --> 04:34.250
And she starts
to blame Krishna Bhoir for it.

04:34.830 --> 04:37.370
She knows it was a little too late.

04:38.080 --> 04:41.120
Now the only option she has

04:41.450 --> 04:44.330
is to wait for Shrimurli.

04:44.660 --> 04:49.790
Because she is pregnant
with Shrimurli's child.

04:50.250 --> 04:54.660
Charu becomes cruel and tough
due to the murder of her father

04:54.790 --> 04:57.540
and the tragic end of her love story.

04:58.040 --> 05:00.910
Charu who is eight months pregnant vows

05:01.000 --> 05:03.080
to never let any love story

05:03.160 --> 05:05.830
in the Bhoir family be fulfilled.

05:06.450 --> 05:09.450
And thus starts a revenge story.

05:10.040 --> 05:14.000
Babu might have to pay
for it in the future.

05:35.370 --> 05:37.000
Pour it quickly.

05:38.370 --> 05:40.790
Boys, you will get drunk.

05:41.200 --> 05:43.660
By night you must be fully sober.

05:44.120 --> 05:46.200
I will give you quarter bottle daily

05:46.290 --> 05:47.580
and one full bottle also.

05:47.830 --> 05:50.950
But in the morning I don't want
to see any goods on the boat.

06:06.660 --> 06:09.930
- Hey.
- Are you there?

06:25.660 --> 06:26.790
- Jana,
- Yes?

06:26.870 --> 06:28.330
- turn the light in this direction.
- Here.

06:31.120 --> 06:32.700
Oh, God. Who is he?

07:15.330 --> 07:19.000
'I am Babu's death.'

07:25.450 --> 07:29.000
'I am Babu's end.'

07:45.620 --> 07:50.080
'I am Babu's doom.'

08:05.620 --> 08:07.330
Who are you?

08:08.120 --> 08:10.160
For this single question

08:11.870 --> 08:15.620
I will destroy Babu's empire.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.000
Ankush (elephant goad).

08:28.040 --> 08:30.120
Sir, there is a phone call
from mister Nitin.

08:30.370 --> 08:31.910
So late in the night?

08:33.700 --> 08:34.950
Hello.

08:36.289 --> 08:37.450
What?

08:38.080 --> 08:39.120
When?

08:39.409 --> 08:41.289
Okay, I will go there immediately.

08:42.830 --> 08:44.700
- Leave
- I'll show you.

08:49.200 --> 08:52.040
Get me snacks and a bottle.

08:52.120 --> 08:53.870
Go on.

08:57.040 --> 08:58.200
Hey, Babu!

09:00.540 --> 09:01.910
Hey, Babu!

09:02.450 --> 09:03.750
Babu!

09:03.830 --> 09:05.500
Hey, hey.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.580
Babu, what happened?

09:08.000 --> 09:09.040
What happened?

09:15.160 --> 09:16.790
Babu!

09:23.040 --> 09:24.370
Babu!

10:02.160 --> 10:04.250
You rascal.

10:05.660 --> 10:09.330
Are you happy now?

10:11.290 --> 10:13.870
If anything happens to Babu...

10:14.660 --> 10:18.950
...I will kill you wherever you are.

10:19.290 --> 10:20.330
Got it?

10:20.790 --> 10:21.450
You rascal.

10:44.040 --> 10:45.160
Hey!

10:45.250 --> 10:46.450
12 bottles!

10:47.790 --> 10:49.540
Let me get some feel of the liquor.

10:49.620 --> 10:52.330
Forget the feel.
Chill, or else I will hit you.

10:52.410 --> 10:53.540
Santya.

10:54.620 --> 10:56.120
- That is what I am saying.
- What?

10:56.410 --> 10:59.330
If it is less chilled,
you don't feel the taste.

10:59.580 --> 11:02.370
Hey, idiot, why are you complaining?

11:03.250 --> 11:04.080
Wait.

11:04.200 --> 11:05.450
Today is birthday.

11:05.540 --> 11:06.660
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.410
- Of Babu.
- Of Babu.

11:23.330 --> 11:24.660
"Hey Babu!"

11:27.950 --> 11:29.040
"Babu!"

11:34.450 --> 11:35.540
"Babu!"

11:41.040 --> 11:42.040
"Babu!"

11:47.580 --> 11:48.580
"Babu!"

11:54.620 --> 11:57.830
There he is. Our hero has arrived.

11:58.910 --> 12:01.080
- Babu is here!
- Hey!

12:13.000 --> 12:14.040
"Babu!"

12:30.080 --> 12:33.330
"When Babu is there.
When Michael is dancing"

12:33.410 --> 12:36.580
"The volume is full and rhythm is fast"

12:36.660 --> 12:39.950
"When Babu is there.
When Michael is dancing"

12:40.040 --> 12:43.200
"The volume is full and rhythm is fast"

12:43.290 --> 12:46.410
"There is music, Indian banjo"

12:46.500 --> 12:49.620
"There is celebration
all over Kopra village"

12:49.830 --> 12:53.200
"Our swag and our steps"

12:53.290 --> 12:56.200
"King Kong dances
to the rhythm of ding-dong"

12:56.290 --> 12:59.200
"Babu!"

12:59.450 --> 13:02.700
"When Babu is there.
When Michael is dancing"

13:02.830 --> 13:06.040
"The volume is full and rhythm is fast"

13:06.120 --> 13:09.290
"When Babu is there.
When Michael is dancing"

13:09.370 --> 13:13.040
"The volume is full and rhythm is fast"

13:13.330 --> 13:16.410
"Babu!"

13:38.370 --> 13:41.790
"Print on front and back covers of books"

13:42.000 --> 13:45.080
"The tale of Babu's fame"

13:45.290 --> 13:48.410
"We are virtuous boys"

13:48.500 --> 13:51.620
"You are part of my friend circle"

13:51.700 --> 13:54.950
"When the public laughs there will be"

13:55.040 --> 13:58.250
"Joy in our hearts"

13:58.330 --> 14:01.660
"I will click a photo and hang a banner"

14:01.750 --> 14:04.750
"I felicitate everybody"

14:04.830 --> 14:08.330
"Ekveera is our Goddess"

14:08.410 --> 14:11.370
"I sing praises of Mother Goddess"

14:11.450 --> 14:14.540
Hey Babu! He has come!

14:14.620 --> 14:17.790
"When Babu is there.
When Michael is dancing"

14:17.910 --> 14:21.080
"The volume is full and rhythm is fast"

14:21.200 --> 14:24.410
"When Babu is there.
When Michael is dancing"

14:24.500 --> 14:27.910
"The volume is full and rhythm is fast"

14:31.040 --> 14:33.700
"Govinda! Gopala! "

14:34.250 --> 14:36.910
"Govinda! Gopala!"

14:37.450 --> 14:40.200
"Govinda! Gopala! "

14:40.790 --> 14:43.580
"Govinda! Gopala! "

14:44.040 --> 14:46.830
"Govinda! Gopala! "

14:47.290 --> 14:50.160
"Govinda! Gopala! "

14:50.540 --> 14:53.790
"Govinda! Govinda! Govinda!"

14:53.870 --> 14:57.790
"Govinda! Govinda! Govinda!"

14:57.870 --> 15:02.620
All hail Lord Krishna.

15:05.290 --> 15:06.950
A little higher. A little bit.

15:07.620 --> 15:09.000
A little bit.

15:10.040 --> 15:14.290
Ah! Wonderful, Babu. Excellent.

15:14.370 --> 15:17.830
A little bit lower. Lower. Lower.

15:19.160 --> 15:23.040
Babu, your hands are not
working the same as earlier.

15:24.330 --> 15:26.370
Babu. Hey, Babu!

15:26.500 --> 15:28.330
Why are you staring over there?
I am here.

15:28.500 --> 15:29.370
Stupid.

15:30.620 --> 15:31.830
I know.

15:32.500 --> 15:35.290
You need a friend
when you want to attract a girl.

15:35.620 --> 15:38.660
And once the girl is attracted,
you forget your friend.

15:38.910 --> 15:40.370
I know. Ouch!

15:40.450 --> 15:41.950
How can you say that?

15:44.950 --> 15:46.370
First let me attract one.

15:46.580 --> 15:48.330
Did you see? Did you see?

15:48.540 --> 15:49.580
It is like this.

15:49.660 --> 15:52.960
When we take out fish,
garbage collects in the net.

15:53.040 --> 15:55.620
We discard it.
Similarly you too are going to discard me.

15:55.700 --> 15:58.290
I know. Do you think I am an idiot?

15:59.080 --> 16:00.290
First let me attract one.

16:00.370 --> 16:04.410
I was in deep sleep in early morning...

16:08.410 --> 16:10.410
Babu, how will I wash my underwear?

16:10.500 --> 16:14.040
Everything seems rosy when I see her.

16:14.120 --> 16:14.910
What are you saying?

16:15.000 --> 16:16.160
Wear dark goggles.

16:16.410 --> 16:18.500
The whole world will
look dark including her.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.750
She is here.

17:22.829 --> 17:24.500
- Babu.
- Yes?

17:24.579 --> 17:26.200
She is very beautiful.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.750
My purpose is served. Go.

17:29.250 --> 17:31.250
Boys, get ready, okay?

17:31.410 --> 17:33.750
Are you ready? Are you ready?

17:33.830 --> 17:35.410
Play as soon as she comes.

17:35.500 --> 17:36.370
Mamdya,

17:36.540 --> 17:38.250
enough of veneration.

17:38.330 --> 17:39.540
- Put it aside.
- Santya...

17:39.620 --> 17:41.370
he simply drinks and eats.

17:41.450 --> 17:42.830
He plays well too.

17:43.250 --> 17:45.910
- I know, I know. Take your positions.
- I already am at the position.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.330
- Mamdya, play on time, okay?
- Hey, Santya...

17:47.410 --> 17:48.120
- Okay?
- Bring it fast?

17:48.200 --> 17:49.750
- Yes. Wait.
- Bring it.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.120
Babu. Babu.

17:57.580 --> 17:58.410
What is this?

18:00.080 --> 18:00.700
Go.

18:02.250 --> 18:03.080
Are you ready?

18:03.160 --> 18:04.700
- Look at me. Look at me.
- Yes ready.

18:05.080 --> 18:06.540
Is she there? Is she there?

18:08.200 --> 18:09.040
No.

18:09.910 --> 18:11.040
Is she there? Is she there?

18:13.620 --> 18:15.120
No, no, don't.

18:16.410 --> 18:17.450
Hey, play it. Play it.

18:17.540 --> 18:19.040
She is here. She is here.

18:19.120 --> 18:20.080
Mamdya, play it.

18:20.160 --> 18:21.120
Play it, Mamdya.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.410
What are you doing?

18:22.580 --> 18:23.950
- Hey, play it, Mamdya.
- Yes, yes.

18:24.040 --> 18:25.450
Hey, Mamdya, play it.

18:25.950 --> 18:29.000
- My sweetheart is passing by.
- Hey, stupid, play it.

18:30.040 --> 18:31.330
Hey, hey!

18:31.410 --> 18:33.040
- What happened?
- Hey, wait. Wait.

18:33.120 --> 18:34.750
- Why are you running away?
- Wait.

18:36.330 --> 18:37.960
Look over there. Over there.

18:38.040 --> 18:39.830
Because of you my sweetheart went away.

18:39.950 --> 18:41.540
Babu, my backside.

18:44.450 --> 18:45.450
Bro, she gave me a look.

18:45.540 --> 18:47.410
You look handsome.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.160
Where are you wandering?

18:56.040 --> 18:57.830
- I wanted...
- Photo.

18:57.950 --> 18:59.500
- He wanted to get his photo clicked.
- Photo. Photo.

18:59.580 --> 19:00.960
- Krishna! Come here.
- Photo.

19:01.040 --> 19:01.790
I am coming.

19:01.950 --> 19:02.790
Let us go.

19:03.040 --> 19:04.450
Hey, where are you going?

19:04.540 --> 19:06.120
To get his photo clicked. Photo.

19:06.540 --> 19:07.290
Babu...

19:07.580 --> 19:09.200
Take this cart to our place.

19:10.040 --> 19:10.790
Me?

19:10.870 --> 19:12.040
Right now?

19:12.410 --> 19:13.330
When?

19:14.830 --> 19:15.500
Take it there.

19:15.580 --> 19:17.200
I am taking it.

19:17.910 --> 19:19.040
Coming.

19:19.250 --> 19:20.500
They want to click photo.

19:22.250 --> 19:24.040
- Babu, get on.
- What?

19:24.120 --> 19:25.200
- Get on. I will handle this.
- Sure.

19:25.290 --> 19:28.000
In the evening
we will have beer at the tank.

19:47.620 --> 19:51.910
"Jingle bell,
jingle bell is tinkling in my ears"

19:55.080 --> 19:59.370
"Last night I dreamed
single bed turned into double"

20:02.660 --> 20:06.450
"Jingle bell,
jingle bell is tinkling in my ears"

20:06.540 --> 20:10.040
"Last night I dreamed
single bed turned into double"

20:10.120 --> 20:12.290
"My heart failed"

20:12.370 --> 20:14.200
"My heart failed"

20:14.290 --> 20:16.000
"Still I came alive"

20:16.080 --> 20:17.950
"Still I came alive"

20:18.040 --> 20:21.580
"Now I can hear your heartbeats"

20:21.660 --> 20:26.120
"Whenever you smile I see my future wife"

20:26.200 --> 20:29.830
"You are the only one and no one else"

20:29.950 --> 20:33.660
"You are my dear future wife"

20:33.750 --> 20:37.500
You are the only one and no one else"

20:37.580 --> 20:42.660
"You are my dear future wife"

21:03.290 --> 21:06.910
"You are on threshold
and in wedding pavilion"

21:07.040 --> 21:10.660
"You are waiting with a garland in hands"

21:14.160 --> 21:18.330
"You are on threshold
and in wedding pavilion"

21:18.410 --> 21:21.960
"You are waiting with a garland in hands"

21:22.040 --> 21:25.830
"I will give a red rose;
we will take couple pose"

21:26.000 --> 21:29.580
"We will seek blessings as a couple"

21:29.660 --> 21:31.500
"The banjo was playing nicely"

21:31.580 --> 21:33.500
"Move"

21:33.580 --> 21:35.540
"Oh, no, a ruckus started"

21:35.620 --> 21:37.250
Oh, a ruckus has started/i>

21:37.330 --> 21:38.960
"The boys got in the mood"

21:39.040 --> 21:41.000
"The path got blocked"

21:41.080 --> 21:48.040
"I see you dancing without care"

21:48.500 --> 21:52.200
"Jingle bell,
jingle bell is tinkling in my ears"

21:52.290 --> 21:55.790
"Last night I dreamed
single bed turned into double"

21:55.910 --> 21:59.790
"My heart failed, still I came alive"

21:59.910 --> 22:03.620
"Now I can hear your heartbeats"

22:03.700 --> 22:08.080
"Whenever you smile I see my future wife"

22:08.160 --> 22:11.830
"You are the only one and no one else"

22:12.000 --> 22:15.580
"You are my dear future wife"

22:15.660 --> 22:19.370
"You are the only one and no one else"

22:19.450 --> 22:23.500
"You are my dear future wife"

22:27.410 --> 22:28.450
Okay, sir.

22:30.250 --> 22:31.700
- Brother, do you want tea?
- Yes.

22:37.660 --> 22:39.540
Hey. You.

22:58.250 --> 22:59.620
Wait here.

23:00.080 --> 23:00.830
Come.

23:00.910 --> 23:02.160
Sir, N. B. Suppliers.

23:02.580 --> 23:04.000
We supply sand.

23:04.290 --> 23:07.660
You must have thought
that we are sons of the soil...

23:08.250 --> 23:10.040
...so you will get low quality material.

23:10.370 --> 23:12.250
No, no. Never.

23:21.000 --> 23:25.790
We will give you better
quality than the duplicate sand...

23:26.370 --> 23:28.290
...supplied to Setu Construction.

23:36.830 --> 23:39.370
Come on, vacate the room.

23:39.450 --> 23:40.700
Vacate the room.

23:40.790 --> 23:42.040
What unruly behaviour is this?

23:42.120 --> 23:43.160
Who are you?

23:43.250 --> 23:44.160
King.

23:44.950 --> 23:45.950
Supplier.

23:46.200 --> 23:48.790
Sir, he is Anilrao Tandel.

23:49.120 --> 23:51.790
And brother, this is our new collector.

23:52.000 --> 23:52.960
Vaman Kadam.

23:53.040 --> 23:56.620
Sir, previously he had
all the tenders for sand.

23:57.080 --> 23:59.200
It was with me earlier also

23:59.790 --> 24:02.080
and in future also it will remain with me.

24:02.160 --> 24:03.500
No question about it.

24:27.000 --> 24:27.950
Sir,

24:28.540 --> 24:32.200
it will be okay if you go against rules...

24:34.370 --> 24:37.120
...but it won't be okay
if you go against me.

24:38.080 --> 24:40.040
Currency note
without Gandhiji's picture...

24:40.950 --> 24:43.500
...and sand transport without Anilrao,

24:45.870 --> 24:49.410
are just garbage.

24:52.660 --> 24:55.540
In future if I see you there,

24:56.040 --> 24:58.290
I will bury you...

24:58.910 --> 25:01.160
- ...and Babu in the same sand.
- Hey.

25:01.250 --> 25:02.580
Calm down.

25:03.080 --> 25:04.790
- Calm down.
- Namdev,

25:06.370 --> 25:09.080
observe discipline in office
and wait outside. Please.

25:11.370 --> 25:12.580
Come out.

25:14.040 --> 25:16.120
I won't leave until you come out.

25:20.790 --> 25:23.250
- What were you saying?
- Come on.

25:31.620 --> 25:34.540
It is business of sand and not grains.

25:34.830 --> 25:36.290
Attend to your farms.

25:36.370 --> 25:37.830
Do not come to the dam.

25:37.950 --> 25:38.950
Oh?

25:39.330 --> 25:41.660
I thought that Anilrao has pet dogs.

25:41.750 --> 25:44.540
- But actually they are monkeys.
- Hey!

25:49.160 --> 25:51.330
Babu is capable of dealing

25:52.700 --> 25:55.120
wherever you want...

25:55.330 --> 25:57.370
...whenever you want

25:58.370 --> 26:00.160
and with any number of persons.

26:02.330 --> 26:03.120
"Babu!"

26:06.450 --> 26:07.200
"Babu!"

26:11.700 --> 26:13.540
Stupid,

26:14.040 --> 26:15.790
there is no need to touch me.

26:17.160 --> 26:19.330
My love has gifted it.

26:20.040 --> 26:21.410
If you stain it even a little bit...

26:21.500 --> 26:25.080
...I will teach you a lesson
you will never forget.

26:25.160 --> 26:25.920
Got it?

26:26.000 --> 26:27.080
"Babu!"

26:35.000 --> 26:35.750
"Babu!"

26:58.660 --> 26:59.580
"Babu!"

27:18.250 --> 27:21.330
"Babu!"

28:24.410 --> 28:26.830
Hey, keep this in mind.

28:27.250 --> 28:30.370
There is only one sand king in this place.

28:31.660 --> 28:33.290
Anilrao Tandel.

28:33.910 --> 28:35.370
No question about it.

28:38.410 --> 28:40.790
When there is a coup in an empire...

28:41.200 --> 28:43.700
...the king has to die first of all.

28:45.250 --> 28:47.540
And anyway, you look more like

28:48.660 --> 28:51.200
a worker and less like a king.

28:52.250 --> 28:53.580
What do you do?

28:54.160 --> 28:56.370
Do you do business or extort money?

28:56.790 --> 28:59.040
If you knew what I do,

28:59.250 --> 29:01.290
you would have come to my office...

29:01.700 --> 29:03.660
...before approaching the collector.

29:05.910 --> 29:09.660
Do you want to expand your
business or create enemies?

29:10.200 --> 29:12.540
I never fear enmity.

29:15.450 --> 29:19.370
But now I will enjoy
doing business with you.

29:19.700 --> 29:21.040
I am giving it.

29:22.580 --> 29:24.290
I am handing over the tender to you.

29:25.660 --> 29:28.700
Excavate as much sand as you wish.

29:30.830 --> 29:34.250
I want to see if you are fit
to be an enemy.

29:37.080 --> 29:39.080
I too don't fear enmity.

29:40.080 --> 29:43.160
But the standard of enmity
should not be lowered.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.450
Standard.

29:47.620 --> 29:48.790
Yes.

29:49.370 --> 29:50.660
Standard.

30:09.830 --> 30:13.450
Our work was accomplished.

30:15.080 --> 30:17.000
I want that boy.

30:17.200 --> 30:19.040
Under any circumstances.

30:20.830 --> 30:22.910
And she is not my choice.

30:24.040 --> 30:26.500
Mother, I want to marry her.

30:27.450 --> 30:29.410
That's it.

30:30.500 --> 30:32.580
I don't care.

30:35.250 --> 30:38.250
Stop dreaming about marriage already.

30:41.910 --> 30:43.330
Leave it to me.

30:51.330 --> 30:53.250
Babu sheth, here is the tender.

30:54.750 --> 30:56.160
Your tender is accepted,

30:56.790 --> 30:58.540
but be careful.

30:58.870 --> 31:00.080
You too.

31:31.200 --> 31:35.200
"No Banjo. Or Disco. Play the sand rap."

31:35.290 --> 31:39.750
"I work hard. I will be my own boss."

31:47.160 --> 31:51.120
"No Banjo. Or Disco. Play the sand rap."

31:51.200 --> 31:55.450
"I work hard. I will be my own boss."

32:11.200 --> 32:13.120
"Ignite the fire in the belly."

32:13.500 --> 32:15.250
"Feel the rage."

32:15.500 --> 32:17.120
"Your parents' love."

32:17.200 --> 32:19.040
"Just trust the ocean."

32:19.200 --> 32:21.410
"Work hard."

32:21.500 --> 32:23.410
"No slackness when it comes to work."

32:23.500 --> 32:25.330
"I will make my dream"

32:25.410 --> 32:27.450
"come true no matter what."

32:27.540 --> 32:29.450
"Leave the disputes aside."

32:29.540 --> 32:31.410
"And rally as a team."

32:31.500 --> 32:33.410
"Don't stop. Don't get tired."

32:33.500 --> 32:35.410
"Fire the truck."

32:35.500 --> 32:37.160
"Put the brakes on and"

32:37.450 --> 32:39.120
"offload the sand."

32:39.450 --> 32:42.950
"The loading is done. Move it."

32:43.500 --> 32:46.290
"Praise the Lord."

32:47.200 --> 32:48.540
"Praise the Lord."

32:48.620 --> 32:51.160
"Let our sand sell for the price of gold."

32:51.540 --> 32:53.500
"Well said, brother."

32:53.580 --> 32:55.620
"Awesome."

33:10.580 --> 33:11.660
Wait!

33:13.620 --> 33:14.950
I won't spare him now.

33:24.750 --> 33:28.830
"This girl is going today..."

33:30.040 --> 33:35.950
"...to her in-laws' house"

33:40.160 --> 33:41.500
The rascal...

33:42.200 --> 33:44.750
the rascal ruined my family.

33:45.120 --> 33:47.200
He ruined my family.

33:49.040 --> 33:52.160
But do not light my funeral pyre...

33:52.870 --> 33:56.330
...before destroying his family.

33:56.790 --> 33:58.250
Are you listening?

33:58.620 --> 34:00.290
Are you listening?

34:00.580 --> 34:04.040
At least now become sensible.

34:04.330 --> 34:08.040
You brother and sister unite.

34:08.250 --> 34:09.449
And...

34:10.159 --> 34:15.750
And ruin Krishna Bhoire's family.

34:16.659 --> 34:20.120
My daughter got married.

34:20.580 --> 34:23.290
My daughter got married.

34:24.409 --> 34:29.199
But I don't see my son-in-law.

34:30.040 --> 34:32.159
Where is son-in-law?

34:33.909 --> 34:35.830
Krishna!

34:36.199 --> 34:38.750
Ruin Krishna. Ruin him! Ruin him!

34:38.830 --> 34:40.330
Mom!

34:44.000 --> 34:46.949
Drink this.
You will be able to speak easily.

34:48.040 --> 34:49.370
Drink it.

34:49.449 --> 34:51.199
Drink.

34:52.580 --> 34:54.580
Drink it. You will feel strong.

34:55.620 --> 34:56.659
Drink.

34:59.620 --> 35:01.000
Let go of it.

35:01.580 --> 35:03.790
- Listen to me!
- Let go of it.

35:04.450 --> 35:07.950
You eat four times a day.

35:08.330 --> 35:10.950
- You are very strong.
- Let go of it.

35:11.160 --> 35:12.830
Very strong.

35:12.950 --> 35:16.080
But what is the use of this strength?

35:16.160 --> 35:17.500
Let go of it.

35:17.580 --> 35:21.660
What is the use of this strength?

35:22.000 --> 35:22.950
Let go of it.

35:23.040 --> 35:25.040
Let go of it? - Why?

35:25.410 --> 35:27.450
Listen to me...

35:27.660 --> 35:29.000
Let go of it.

35:29.160 --> 35:31.410
Listen to me.

35:31.660 --> 35:34.040
- Listen to me!
- Let go of it.

35:34.160 --> 35:35.500
I won't.

35:35.580 --> 35:37.580
- Listen to me!
- Let go of it.

35:37.660 --> 35:39.200
Hey, girl...

35:39.410 --> 35:40.330
Let go of it.

35:40.410 --> 35:45.410
I cannot bear to see you
in this condition.

35:45.750 --> 35:48.500
- Let go of it!
- I can't bear to see it!

35:48.660 --> 35:50.080
- Let go of it!
- I can't bear to see it!

35:50.160 --> 35:52.370
Listen to me!

35:52.450 --> 35:54.120
- Let go of it!
- I won't let go.

35:54.200 --> 35:55.580
Let go of it!

35:55.660 --> 35:56.750
No!

35:56.830 --> 35:58.290
I said let go of it!

35:59.790 --> 36:03.000
Let go of it! Let go of it!

36:03.330 --> 36:05.200
Oh, God.

36:06.450 --> 36:10.500
Where have you left your own child?

36:11.580 --> 36:13.000
Find him.

36:13.120 --> 36:16.700
Or there will be no one
with you when you die.

36:16.790 --> 36:19.200
To sit by your side.

36:19.290 --> 36:22.540
Listen to me, girl.

36:32.200 --> 36:33.500
Babu.

36:33.750 --> 36:36.040
Babu sheth.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.120
I am very bored of drinking.

36:40.200 --> 36:41.950
Are you bored?

36:42.080 --> 36:44.160
Have beer.

36:46.250 --> 36:48.080
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

36:49.120 --> 36:50.370
Let us go to Goa.

36:56.370 --> 37:00.330
On this side liquor,
on the other side Paru.

37:00.410 --> 37:05.540
On this side chicken legs
and on the other side bare legs.

37:10.120 --> 37:12.160
Tea for mom and toast for dad.

37:13.410 --> 37:15.250
Goa went into tunnel.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.200
Why appreciate it?

37:17.290 --> 37:18.660
Bare legs.

37:19.200 --> 37:20.330
Shut up.

37:22.120 --> 37:23.620
I say,

37:24.410 --> 37:25.620
are you coming?

37:25.950 --> 37:27.620
Where? To Goa?

37:28.160 --> 37:29.290
To pee.

37:30.040 --> 37:31.500
To Goa to pee?

37:33.580 --> 37:35.080
He is going to Goa right now.

37:35.160 --> 37:36.660
- Hey, go and pee.
- A tripped.

37:37.790 --> 37:39.450
Who goes to Goa to pee?

37:39.700 --> 37:41.080
Oh, no...

37:41.620 --> 37:43.250
- What happened?
- The zip is missing.

37:43.790 --> 37:45.450
Keep your hands to the front.

37:45.540 --> 37:46.450
There.

37:46.540 --> 37:47.910
Take them to the back.

37:48.000 --> 37:48.700
There.

37:48.790 --> 37:51.660
Back or front,
take them where the zip is...

37:51.750 --> 37:54.410
...and do the job.

37:54.950 --> 37:59.000
I found it, Babu. I found it.

37:59.160 --> 38:01.410
How to take him to Goa?

38:07.040 --> 38:09.410
There is pressure
in his stomach that is why....

38:10.040 --> 38:11.660
- Bald man...
- I drank too much.

38:11.750 --> 38:12.540
Look.

38:12.620 --> 38:14.830
We will go when we feel like it.

38:18.040 --> 38:20.290
- We will take tempo and truck and go to Goa.
- Babu.

38:20.370 --> 38:22.410
Babu. Babu.

38:22.790 --> 38:27.450
Over there two trucks are stealthily
driving towards the highway.

38:30.040 --> 38:32.000
Look over there.

38:32.080 --> 38:33.700
Sada, where is the key?

38:33.790 --> 38:35.540
- Give him the key!
- Give him the key!

38:36.040 --> 38:37.330
- Hurry up.
- Hurry.

38:37.620 --> 38:40.040
- I know who the thieves are.
- Babu, don't spare them.

39:38.830 --> 39:41.540
Enough, enough. Back up. Back up. Stop.

39:42.120 --> 39:43.790
Lock the truck properly.

39:45.950 --> 39:48.040
Sada, keep a watch.

39:48.330 --> 39:49.660
They can come any time.

39:50.910 --> 39:52.450
What to do with these?

39:53.000 --> 39:54.450
There are no documents for the vehicles.

39:54.950 --> 39:55.950
Come, I will tell you.

39:56.540 --> 39:57.450
Where is Babu?

39:57.700 --> 39:59.330
Babu must be down there on the shore.

39:59.500 --> 40:02.200
Look, there is an order
from the collector.

40:02.660 --> 40:04.620
- Excavation is stopped for three months.
- Okay.

40:05.450 --> 40:07.750
Do not allow anybody to
excavate sand from the port...

40:07.830 --> 40:09.000
...and we too must not excavate it.

40:09.080 --> 40:09.790
Okay.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.450
Sada, this is stolen goods.

40:12.540 --> 40:13.700
Keep a watch over it.

40:13.790 --> 40:15.790
- Okay.
- I will see what to do with it.

40:15.870 --> 40:16.370
Yes, sure.

40:16.450 --> 40:18.200
We will have to lodge
a complaint about this.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.290
Tell Babu to meet me.

40:20.580 --> 40:22.370
- I will be waiting at the street corner.
- Okay.

40:27.540 --> 40:28.750
Rama, come here.

40:29.450 --> 40:31.040
Put this tyre over there.

40:51.950 --> 40:54.040
Sometimes I feel very scared.

40:54.580 --> 40:56.700
You know my father's temperament.

40:56.790 --> 40:57.910
I know.

40:59.330 --> 41:01.750
Do not worry at all.

41:03.540 --> 41:08.950
Tonight I am going to talk
to my parents about our marriage.

41:09.790 --> 41:10.790
What?

41:11.450 --> 41:13.200
That is what I am scared of.

41:14.080 --> 41:15.120
Why fear?

41:17.500 --> 41:18.370
Fine.

41:18.790 --> 41:21.950
Do not tell them that
we are having an affair.

41:24.580 --> 41:27.120
Just tell them that you like me.

41:29.080 --> 41:32.200
And then come to my house...

41:34.040 --> 41:35.700
with your parents.

41:40.040 --> 41:41.750
Why not reveal it?

41:42.370 --> 41:43.540
We are having an affair, right?

41:45.910 --> 41:47.370
I feel scared.

41:47.750 --> 41:49.410
I don't feel scared.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.120
But I do.

42:12.620 --> 42:15.410
- Stop the vehicle.
- Hey, stop!

42:15.620 --> 42:16.830
Stop.

42:20.660 --> 42:22.160
Where are you going?

42:22.250 --> 42:24.750
What is the truck loaded with?
Check the truck.

42:44.040 --> 42:45.750
Sir, it's N.B Supply's truck.

42:45.830 --> 42:47.700
It is full of sand.

42:48.620 --> 42:51.330
- Don't you get it?
- You will speak.

42:51.500 --> 42:53.790
You keep quiet. You will speak.
I am there. Speak.

42:54.750 --> 42:57.160
He can't do it.

42:57.250 --> 43:00.040
Hey, do not interfere if you can't do it.

43:00.120 --> 43:01.200
- I will speak.
- No.

43:01.910 --> 43:03.290
Mother! Mother!

43:07.700 --> 43:09.910
Mother, did you see? Did you see?

43:10.160 --> 43:12.660
This? Grandmother, tell me. This?

43:12.910 --> 43:14.290
Does anyone do this?

43:14.540 --> 43:17.700
Does any daughter-in-law
do this for her mother-in-law?

43:18.250 --> 43:20.410
Does your daughter-in-law do this for you?

43:21.000 --> 43:23.500
No. And in looks also
she is very attractive..

43:23.950 --> 43:26.450
You get to see such
daughters-in-law only on TV.

43:26.540 --> 43:28.540
No, no, there are in our village as well.

43:28.660 --> 43:29.540
Right, Babu?

43:29.620 --> 43:30.950
- Yes.
- Ask Babu.

43:31.120 --> 43:32.660
- Am I right?
- Yes.

43:32.750 --> 43:35.830
I will tell you. Right, Babu?

43:36.080 --> 43:39.080
You know Warchi Wadi?

43:39.370 --> 43:40.910
The corner of Hanuman temple.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.960
- That one.
- Who?

43:43.040 --> 43:44.660
Sandhya. She eloped.

43:44.750 --> 43:46.700
Really? That must be Manda.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.450
Why do you speak if you don't know?

43:49.040 --> 43:52.330
Not that one. I know her. I have seen.

43:52.620 --> 43:54.040
Let me tell you.

43:54.370 --> 43:57.250
There is no other girl like her
in the whole village.

43:57.330 --> 43:59.370
- Really?
- So beautiful.

43:59.700 --> 44:03.290
Let me tell you. Lips like a fish.

44:03.750 --> 44:06.700
Walks like a serpent.

44:06.790 --> 44:07.660
Is it?

44:07.750 --> 44:09.120
Doe-eyed.

44:09.200 --> 44:11.330
Hey, Santya, let it be. Let it be.

44:11.410 --> 44:13.450
You too will look the same after drinking.

44:13.540 --> 44:15.950
Go and look at yourself in a mirror.

44:17.000 --> 44:18.580
It seems the girl is a drunkard.

44:18.660 --> 44:19.660
What?

44:25.580 --> 44:28.160
Babu, they don't understand me
if I am normal.

44:28.540 --> 44:30.290
Let us have a couple of drinks.

44:30.370 --> 44:32.500
We will tell the whole village. Come.

44:33.040 --> 44:34.160
- Hey.
- Even they found out!

44:34.250 --> 44:36.660
Come. Your appearance is deceptive.

44:36.750 --> 44:38.250
- I have had enough of your nonsense.
- Sir, what happened?

44:38.330 --> 44:39.410
You are showing off like a hero.

44:39.500 --> 44:41.410
Sir, what happened?

44:41.500 --> 44:42.080
Sir.

44:42.160 --> 44:43.790
- Move it.
- Let go of my collar.

44:43.870 --> 44:45.790
- Go and call Babu's father.
- Yes.

44:53.620 --> 44:55.120
- Sawant, bring him out.
- Leave me.

44:55.200 --> 44:56.250
I will teach him a lesson.

44:56.330 --> 44:57.910
- I haven't excavated sand.
- Move it.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.620
- Have you complained?
- I know. At whose behest you have done this.

45:00.700 --> 45:03.040
Sir, we have paid all the bills
and submitted invoices.

45:03.330 --> 45:04.500
Sir, I have been doing
business since many months.

45:04.580 --> 45:05.620
Would I make a mistake?

45:05.700 --> 45:08.750
Would I abandon a truck loaded
with sand at the check post?

45:09.160 --> 45:12.160
Babu, I understand everything you say...

45:12.410 --> 45:14.830
...but I really didn't know
that they were going to arrest you.

45:15.410 --> 45:17.540
- Sir, you...
- Move. You have talked a lot.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.580
Jadhav, lock him up.

45:19.700 --> 45:21.000
Sir. Sir.

45:21.250 --> 45:22.330
Gorinde sir, I haven't done anything.

45:22.410 --> 45:24.750
Hey, smart boy,
if you utter another word...

45:24.830 --> 45:26.500
...I will stuff the baton in your mouth.

45:26.660 --> 45:30.580
ML06 4810 and ML06 2129.

45:30.660 --> 45:32.370
You have stolen both the vehicles.

45:33.040 --> 45:34.290
- Jadhav, bring the file.
- Yes, sir.

45:34.370 --> 45:35.450
2129?

45:37.250 --> 45:37.950
Here, sir.

45:38.040 --> 45:39.040
4810?

45:39.910 --> 45:40.540
Look at this.

45:40.750 --> 45:41.700
Complaint about theft.

45:41.950 --> 45:43.040
Documents and owner.

45:43.540 --> 45:45.410
Say whatever you want to say
in the court.

45:46.120 --> 45:47.620
Let me see who saves you.

45:53.160 --> 45:55.370
- Bring out the rascal.
- Hey, move.

45:55.660 --> 45:57.200
You rascal enter my house

45:57.290 --> 45:58.700
- and rob me?
- Bring out the rascal.

45:58.790 --> 46:02.040
Do you have the capacity?
You rascal.

46:04.750 --> 46:06.250
What had I told you?

46:07.080 --> 46:10.250
There is only one sand king in this area.

46:12.040 --> 46:13.660
Anilrao Tandel.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.200
You rascal.

46:16.620 --> 46:18.000
Hey, Gorinde, take him.

46:18.080 --> 46:19.540
I have brought the associate of the thief.

46:19.620 --> 46:21.540
That too after proper treatment.

46:22.370 --> 46:23.830
Book him for attempt to murder.

46:24.120 --> 46:25.160
This is the evidence.

46:26.540 --> 46:28.290
Will you lock him up or shall I do it?

46:29.290 --> 46:32.660
- You rascal.
- Hey, Anil, I am there.

46:33.040 --> 46:34.120
Yes,

46:34.790 --> 46:36.540
but you are not where you are needed.

46:36.830 --> 46:38.120
I am there.

46:41.540 --> 46:42.620
Excavate.

46:43.120 --> 46:44.450
Excavate! Excavate!

46:45.290 --> 46:49.660
You are suitable only for uprooting,
not for excavation.

46:50.410 --> 46:52.540
Do you understand your worth?

46:53.040 --> 46:55.040
Hey, Tandel...

46:55.450 --> 46:58.540
- Just wait until I teach you a lesson.
- Let him go.

46:58.620 --> 47:00.370
I said let him go.

47:14.620 --> 47:16.870
Will you fight them alone?

47:18.870 --> 47:20.120
Do use your head sometimes.

47:20.330 --> 47:22.370
Who had told you to act foolishly?

47:23.000 --> 47:25.040
Hey, idiot, I am talking to you.

47:26.910 --> 47:29.200
I will have to deal with this as well.

47:29.450 --> 47:30.950
Weren't we facing enough trouble?

47:31.080 --> 47:32.790
- And you added to it.
- Hey,

47:34.250 --> 47:36.750
your love affair has ruined everybody.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.410
And what have you handled before this?

47:39.950 --> 47:42.200
Where was your smartness at that time?

47:44.620 --> 47:45.580
Sir. Sir.

47:46.040 --> 47:48.200
Why have you arrested Babu?

47:48.450 --> 47:49.950
What has he done now?

47:50.830 --> 47:53.620
Look, I understand what you want to say.

47:54.330 --> 47:57.080
The case for theft is stronger
than the one for smuggling of sand.

47:57.290 --> 47:59.250
To whom you are explaining?

47:59.410 --> 48:01.790
Stop shopping adornments for that girl...

48:02.750 --> 48:05.160
- ...and think of what is going on.
- Quiet. Quiet.

48:05.250 --> 48:06.250
Hey,

48:07.750 --> 48:09.040
don't teach me.

48:09.250 --> 48:10.620
Have you gone crazy?

48:11.370 --> 48:12.290
Tell me.

48:13.160 --> 48:13.790
Speak.

48:13.950 --> 48:14.660
Hey,

48:15.290 --> 48:16.950
this is what you had left out.

48:17.160 --> 48:18.540
Are you fighting with each other?

48:21.790 --> 48:23.040
Forget this.

48:23.700 --> 48:26.250
Go today itself and meet the collector.

48:26.580 --> 48:28.000
He will do something. Go.

48:28.080 --> 48:30.330
Sir, my son cannot commit theft.

48:30.410 --> 48:31.790
Someone has implicated him.

48:31.950 --> 48:33.000
Sir. Sir!

49:04.540 --> 49:05.700
He is Abhay Poddar.

49:05.790 --> 49:07.160
Owner of Setu Construction.

49:07.540 --> 49:08.910
He posted your bail.

49:10.120 --> 49:11.410
Sir, why this favour?

49:11.500 --> 49:12.700
Not favour.

49:12.950 --> 49:14.160
This is business.

49:14.620 --> 49:16.120
Come and meet me in my office.

49:19.830 --> 49:21.160
- Deshpande, let us go.
- Yes, sir.

50:32.080 --> 50:33.160
Anilrao.

50:34.120 --> 50:35.200
Anilrao!

50:36.910 --> 50:39.830
Are you going to meet
the girl here itself?

50:41.160 --> 50:43.120
Tea is getting cold. Come on.

50:47.370 --> 50:48.500
Anilrao,

50:51.370 --> 50:54.120
she looks so nice even
when she is not dressed up.

50:56.660 --> 50:58.830
Girl, get ready.

51:07.200 --> 51:09.250
Do not make haste unnecessarily.

51:10.790 --> 51:12.750
She still hasn't rejected Babu's proposal.

51:14.580 --> 51:16.580
Do only what I tell you.

51:17.250 --> 51:19.950
Then this girl will be married off to you.

51:21.660 --> 51:24.040
I realised it long time back.

51:37.120 --> 51:40.830
At least show respect for food even
if you don't respect your parents.

51:40.910 --> 51:42.040
Yes.

51:42.120 --> 51:43.450
Give it to me.

51:44.290 --> 51:45.370
You eat.

51:47.580 --> 51:48.830
Have you done business?

51:49.040 --> 51:50.000
Have you?

51:50.830 --> 51:52.290
Have you become wiser?

51:53.290 --> 51:55.620
You couldn't handle
the business we have...

51:57.120 --> 52:00.160
...but you will have to survive
on this business all your life.

52:00.250 --> 52:01.250
Got it?

52:02.200 --> 52:07.200
I say no arguments at mealtime.

52:07.910 --> 52:09.540
I like Mhatre's daughter Supriya.

52:09.750 --> 52:10.500
What?

52:11.450 --> 52:13.330
And I want to marry her only.

52:14.450 --> 52:17.120
Babu, what is going on?

52:18.250 --> 52:19.960
Do you realise what you are saying?

52:20.040 --> 52:22.410
Tomorrow we have to go to her
house with marriage proposal.

52:23.870 --> 52:25.750
Did you see? Did you see his arrogance?

52:26.120 --> 52:29.160
He doesn't consult us.
He directly informs us.

52:31.290 --> 52:35.540
He likes her
but who knows if she likes him?

52:36.250 --> 52:37.250
So come with me.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.830
- I will ask her in your presence.
- Hey,

52:40.830 --> 52:43.040
I don't have time to spare
to accompany you.

52:47.080 --> 52:48.200
Then I will go alone.

52:48.540 --> 52:49.500
- Babu.
- Hey,

52:49.580 --> 52:51.040
- Listen to me.
- show arrogance after eating.

52:51.200 --> 52:52.540
Don't act arrogantly while ignoring food.

52:53.700 --> 52:55.120
You need not go.

52:55.910 --> 52:57.620
I and Kunda will go.

53:10.040 --> 53:14.080
Babu is being forced
to suffer for my deeds.

53:14.370 --> 53:16.040
That is what I constantly feel.

53:18.410 --> 53:21.410
Sometimes I wonder
why Babu is being punished...

53:22.580 --> 53:24.160
...for the decision I took?

53:24.450 --> 53:27.660
I feel like telling him everything but...

53:28.500 --> 53:30.830
...I am unable to do anything.

53:31.200 --> 53:33.200
You are worrying unnecessarily.

53:35.040 --> 53:36.250
Everything will be fine.

53:37.370 --> 53:39.580
Oh, my! Babu's photo in newspaper?

53:39.660 --> 53:40.870
What did the boy do?

53:41.040 --> 53:43.660
Abundance of sand mafia
in Raigadh district.

53:43.870 --> 53:44.870
Babu Bhoir.

53:45.120 --> 53:46.750
What else is he going to do?

53:53.120 --> 53:55.000
Mhatre sheth,

53:57.160 --> 53:58.120
Babu.

53:58.410 --> 53:59.540
Hey, play it!

54:00.120 --> 54:01.500
Hey, stop!

54:02.660 --> 54:05.750
Hey, are you leading your
father's wedding procession?

54:05.910 --> 54:09.250
I love Supriya so we came here.

54:09.330 --> 54:11.410
Hey, are you worthy of it?

54:11.500 --> 54:15.450
Hey, Jagan,
do not tell me who is worthy of what.

54:15.750 --> 54:17.580
There is no need to tell.

54:17.750 --> 54:19.700
Read what is printed in the newspaper.

54:19.830 --> 54:22.330
Your son is a thief.

54:22.500 --> 54:24.830
I would rather stuff
my daughter in a sack...

54:24.910 --> 54:26.450
...and throw her in the sea...

54:26.540 --> 54:29.250
...but I won't marry her off to your son.

54:29.540 --> 54:33.450
What to expect from the son
of a vegetable vendor?

54:33.540 --> 54:35.750
- All of you are thieves.
- Brother,

54:36.290 --> 54:37.500
do ask your daughter also.

54:37.580 --> 54:38.330
Hey.

54:38.540 --> 54:40.370
Uncle, please listen to me.

54:40.700 --> 54:42.250
Hey, stay within your limit.

54:42.330 --> 54:43.200
Jagan.

54:43.370 --> 54:45.290
I am known as Jagan sheth.

54:45.370 --> 54:46.040
Go away.

54:46.120 --> 54:48.540
We want a rich son-in-law.

54:48.620 --> 54:49.620
Supriya,

54:50.750 --> 54:51.830
tell them

54:52.830 --> 54:54.830
how much we love each other.

54:55.870 --> 54:56.750
Tell him!

54:57.040 --> 54:59.660
Tell them how much we love each other.

55:00.410 --> 55:01.700
Tell your parents.

55:03.040 --> 55:04.910
All the dreams we dreamt.

55:05.080 --> 55:06.500
I will fulfil all of them.

55:06.750 --> 55:08.580
Supriya. Hey, Supriya,

55:09.410 --> 55:11.160
there is no need to fear the world.

55:11.250 --> 55:12.450
These are our times.

55:15.250 --> 55:16.540
Look at me once.

55:16.620 --> 55:18.120
Supriya, don't cry.

55:18.330 --> 55:20.290
Tell them. Look at me.

55:20.370 --> 55:22.290
Supriya, I am Babu.

55:24.080 --> 55:25.700
Look. Look, who is here.

55:25.830 --> 55:29.450
Look. Your sister-in-law has come.

55:29.660 --> 55:32.330
Supriya.
Supriya, I have fixed everything.

55:32.620 --> 55:34.450
Speak. Supriya.

55:35.160 --> 55:36.290
Hey, shh!

55:36.370 --> 55:38.040
- Babu.
- Look, she spoke.

55:38.120 --> 55:39.620
- Santya, she spoke.
- Come.

55:39.700 --> 55:41.250
- She said that she likes Babu.
- Let us go.

55:41.330 --> 55:42.540
Kunda, look, she spoke.

55:42.620 --> 55:43.870
- People are watching.
- Look.

55:44.000 --> 55:45.120
- Let us go.
- Look, everyone.

55:45.200 --> 55:45.870
She spoke.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.370
- Santya, she spoke.
- Babu, let us go.

55:47.500 --> 55:49.200
Supriya, look at me.

55:49.580 --> 55:52.660
- Supriya...
- Enough!

55:57.000 --> 55:57.830
Supriya.

56:00.750 --> 56:02.750
Ba... Babu.

56:03.290 --> 56:04.250
Supriya.

56:07.700 --> 56:08.870
Supriya.

56:11.040 --> 56:13.330
Supriya!

56:20.370 --> 56:21.370
Babu.

56:23.540 --> 56:24.830
I thought

56:26.250 --> 56:28.040
that she will be crazy for you...

56:29.620 --> 56:31.700
...but in fact you are crazy for her.

56:33.620 --> 56:36.370
Tea for mom and toast for dad.

56:39.040 --> 56:40.080
Hey,

56:40.700 --> 56:44.120
who is Babu?

56:46.200 --> 56:47.290
Hey, Babu.

56:48.870 --> 56:50.250
Hey, Babu.

56:52.410 --> 56:53.410
Hey,

56:54.950 --> 56:55.700
go.

56:57.160 --> 56:58.410
Take her along.

57:00.000 --> 57:04.160
Take her and fly away like a bird.

57:04.580 --> 57:05.330
What?

57:05.910 --> 57:07.000
Well?

57:07.540 --> 57:09.000
Hey, Babu.

57:12.700 --> 57:15.040
You are a hero. Hero.

57:16.580 --> 57:18.660
Do not act like a coward.

57:19.500 --> 57:20.290
Look.

57:22.330 --> 57:23.540
Tell me

57:26.040 --> 57:27.330
what is love?

57:28.410 --> 57:30.580
Tell me what is love?

57:31.080 --> 57:32.250
I will tell you.

57:34.080 --> 57:36.040
Love.

57:38.080 --> 57:39.450
Go on making efforts...

57:40.830 --> 57:44.330
...till you die.

57:45.700 --> 57:47.080
Santya is there.

57:47.540 --> 57:51.040
Santya is there for Babu.
Santya is there till he dies.

57:54.120 --> 57:56.200
Go, my lover boy.

57:57.830 --> 57:59.620
Bing home your bride.

58:00.120 --> 58:01.120
Go.

58:11.040 --> 58:12.250
Santya.

58:29.870 --> 58:30.750
Supriya!

58:38.620 --> 58:39.700
I know

58:42.080 --> 58:45.200
that you love me as much as I love you.

58:45.330 --> 58:47.750
Yes, but it is a different thing

58:48.450 --> 58:50.370
that one needs guts to say that.

58:51.160 --> 58:52.160
Come.

58:53.040 --> 58:55.160
We will show our love to the world.

58:55.250 --> 58:55.870
Come.

58:56.620 --> 58:57.660
Where, Babu?

58:57.750 --> 58:59.750
We will elope and get married.
Come on.

59:00.540 --> 59:02.500
No, Babu. I cannot do it.

59:02.580 --> 59:05.450
Supriya, your father won't listen.
Don't be scared.

59:05.540 --> 59:07.080
Babu, listen to me.
I won't be able to do it.

59:07.160 --> 59:08.410
- Supriya, I am there.
- Babu.

59:08.500 --> 59:09.580
Supriya, come!

59:27.790 --> 59:29.580
She is my daughter-in-law.

59:32.370 --> 59:34.080
She is not available for anybody.

59:50.120 --> 59:51.830
The unworthy

59:53.910 --> 59:55.370
should not fall in love.

01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:14.370
"Small size. Big size"

01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:18.410
"Small size, big size, burden of woes"

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:20.200
Bro, what does small mean?

01:00:20.290 --> 01:00:21.250
Tiny. Tiny.

01:00:21.330 --> 01:00:22.370
Tell him.

01:00:22.450 --> 01:00:26.330
"Small size. Big size"

01:00:26.410 --> 01:00:30.870
"Small size, big size, burden of woes"

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:42.370
"It closes in from all sides and traps me"

01:00:42.450 --> 01:00:46.370
"God, please untangle the web
and do a miracle"

01:00:46.450 --> 01:00:50.330
"It closes in from all sides and traps me"

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:54.120
"God, please untangle the web
and do a miracle"

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:56.330
"All joy is lost."

01:00:56.410 --> 01:00:58.200
"How do I walk on road"

01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:02.410
"Mend my broken heart somehow"

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:06.410
"Small size. Big size"

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:10.410
"Small size, big size, burden of woes"

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:14.450
"Small size. Big size"

01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:18.700
"Small size, big size, burden of woes"

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:35.200
"I will build a nice big bungalow
in the village"

01:01:35.290 --> 01:01:37.700
Babu, direct a huge one!

01:01:38.410 --> 01:01:42.330
"I will build a nice big bungalow
in the village"

01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:46.370
"I would have begotten children,
but not possible now"

01:01:46.450 --> 01:01:50.410
"This is new illness, you must bear it"

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:53.620
"There is no remedy for it"

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:58.000
"Fill up my glass. Let me drink it"

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:02.450
"Mend my broken heart somehow"

01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:06.410
"Small size. Big size"

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:10.410
"Small size, big size, burden of woes"

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:14.410
"Small size. Big size"

01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:19.160
"Small size, big size, burden of woes"

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:38.370
"When a jolly boy becomes old"

01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:42.330
"When I grew up I fell in love"

01:02:42.410 --> 01:02:46.450
"I am a lover but she doesn't care"

01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:50.330
"Tell her how I will live without her"

01:02:50.410 --> 01:02:54.370
"Sadness has filled my heart"

01:02:54.450 --> 01:02:57.580
"Mend my broken heart somehow"

01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.450
Hey, look at the size.

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:03.450
"Small size. Big size"

01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:07.450
"Small size, big size, burden of woes"

01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:11.410
"Small size. Big size"

01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:16.200
"Small size, big size, burden of woes"

01:03:30.410 --> 01:03:33.620
Slowdown. Slow down.
Babu!

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.370
We fell down. We fell down.

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:41.450
We fell down.

01:03:58.870 --> 01:04:00.620
Babu,

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:03.500
close your eyes.

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.410
Close your eyes.

01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:07.200
Close your eyes.

01:04:07.450 --> 01:04:08.620
Look over there.

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:12.500
Now open them

01:04:13.290 --> 01:04:14.750
and extend your hands.

01:04:17.330 --> 01:04:19.290
It is Indian banjo.

01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:34.450
The cause of heartbreak
is different for each person.

01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:38.330
For some it is big

01:04:40.330 --> 01:04:43.410
and for some it is very big.

01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:47.580
Play it.

01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:51.290
Play it.

01:05:19.250 --> 01:05:21.330
Hey, Babu.

01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:35.250
Santya.

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:32.330
I lived my life without any expectations.

01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:34.200
Neither from my parents,

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.120
nor from my husband.

01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:44.040
But a person should be adamant
at some point.

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:47.620
You might get scolded...

01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:52.870
...but at least people
do notice your preferences.

01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:00.080
But ever since I was born

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:04.830
I have looked after others' preferences.

01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:11.620
My joys and sorrows,

01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:15.160
everything is for your sake.

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:22.330
I just kept waiting for one thing, that...

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:31.870
...at some point you will belong to me.

01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:38.580
Doctor!

01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:40.870
Doctor!

01:07:41.790 --> 01:07:43.040
Doctor!

01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:52.580
Sister, please call
the doctor immediately.

01:07:53.330 --> 01:07:55.250
He is suffering.

01:07:55.330 --> 01:07:57.000
Please call the doctor.

01:08:49.950 --> 01:08:50.830
I am sorry.

01:08:50.910 --> 01:08:52.540
We could not save him.

01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:55.000
It was too late.

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:01.080
Doctor.

01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:15.950
So you have set up camp here today.

01:10:18.250 --> 01:10:20.200
It is my beer. It is mine.

01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:21.830
Did it fall on my head?

01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:22.620
Over there.

01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:25.870
Hey, is this the place
to get drunk and lie down?

01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:27.870
We fell down in the courtyard.

01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:30.160
Is this your house?

01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:32.000
We didn't fall down in your house!

01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:35.000
I know people like you very well.

01:10:35.370 --> 01:10:36.370
Right now you are in my courtyard.

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:38.160
It won't take you long to enter my house.

01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:40.540
You know us very well, do you?

01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:42.250
Are we street-dwellers?

01:10:42.330 --> 01:10:44.000
- Don't we have a home?
- I can see that.

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:45.330
You were lying in the street.

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:47.540
Go away.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.620
Right now I just poured water on you.

01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:52.910
Next time if I see you here,
I will make by brother pee on you.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:53.950
Did you see?

01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:55.660
Did you see what she said?

01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:57.200
Are you leaving or shall
I hit you with the bucket?

01:10:57.290 --> 01:10:58.910
- You are threatening with a bucket...
- Get lost.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
- You sister of a peeing brother.
- Don't show me the bottle.

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:02.120
Get lost.

01:11:02.370 --> 01:11:03.370
Crazy girl.

01:11:03.870 --> 01:11:06.450
Give me the bottle.

01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:09.290
Babu, a thorn went through my foot.

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:13.790
- Babu, we will drink as long as we live.
- Cheers.

01:11:14.450 --> 01:11:17.500
Fall in love with dumb animals.

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:22.000
Do not fall in love with talkative girls.

01:11:23.950 --> 01:11:29.290
Because you can never predict...

01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:33.450
...when she will ditch you.

01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:34.750
You can never predict it.

01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:37.040
- You can never predict it.
- You can never predict it.

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.540
- Where did you see them?
- I can't tell.

01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:40.410
- Where did you see them?
- Okay.

01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:41.370
But...

01:11:41.950 --> 01:11:44.700
I should marry her.

01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:46.960
What should I do, Santya?

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.250
I should marry her.

01:11:48.330 --> 01:11:50.120
Move, you moron.

01:11:50.290 --> 01:11:52.580
Look, everyone's sitting inside.

01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:54.080
What should she take?

01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:55.500
My name.

01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:57.540
Your name.

01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:01.660
You should have married her

01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:07.620
Chickpeas. Chickpeas.

01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:11.250
- He entered my cowshed.
- She should take my name.

01:12:11.330 --> 01:12:13.500
- I will teach him a lesson.
- She must.

01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:16.080
Hey, drunkards, get out of here!

01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:18.330
- Run off.
- Get lost!

01:12:24.790 --> 01:12:28.080
I am looking for Babu.

01:12:31.450 --> 01:12:32.500
You see?

01:12:33.290 --> 01:12:34.660
You entered my cowshed.

01:12:35.450 --> 01:12:38.080
Couldn't you find any other place
in the village to get drunk?

01:12:39.330 --> 01:12:41.750
If I see you again
I will throw you into the stove.

01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:54.290
Babu.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.330
- Fall in love with dumb animals.
- Fall in love.

01:13:00.450 --> 01:13:04.040
- Don't fall in love with a talkative girl.
- Yeah.

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.910
The cow gave birth to a calf.

01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:07.750
See how nice it is.

01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:09.250
Leave them. Come inside fast.

01:13:09.330 --> 01:13:12.120
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:14.870
Congratulations.

01:13:15.330 --> 01:13:16.580
A calf was born.

01:13:17.250 --> 01:13:18.580
When should I come to eat sweets?

01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:19.580
- Come.
- Come.

01:13:19.950 --> 01:13:20.790
Leave!

01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:22.330
Santya, it's a cow.

01:13:22.450 --> 01:13:24.450
It's a buffalo, not a cow.

01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:26.660
Not a cow. Hey, Babu!

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:28.920
What you say is fine,

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.370
but it would have been good...

01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:31.620
...if you had asked Babu.

01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:32.790
Right.

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:34.290
Why ask him?

01:13:34.750 --> 01:13:37.200
Your daughter is very nice.

01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:39.000
Who will refuse her hand?

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:43.540
You trusted my word
and have agreed to this marriage.

01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:45.330
I will treat her like my own daughter.

01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:47.700
Yes, but we should
know about the groom also.

01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:49.290
- True.
- What kind of a person he is?

01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:51.450
What for?

01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:53.330
You won't find a boy like my Babu...

01:13:53.410 --> 01:13:55.700
...even if you search in 100 villages.

01:13:55.790 --> 01:13:56.790
- Right?
- Yes, yes,

01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:59.620
we know about your son's reputation.

01:14:00.290 --> 01:14:01.330
Zomada.

01:14:02.250 --> 01:14:05.290
I am confident that Sunita
will manage everything.

01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:08.250
I trust you as a human being.

01:14:08.330 --> 01:14:10.660
So everything will be as per your wish.

01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:12.750
Really? Shall we fix the alliance?

01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:15.250
- Sure.
- Yes, go ahead.

01:14:20.370 --> 01:14:22.620
'Do you understand what I am saying,
you idiot?'

01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:24.920
I am talking to him. Why are you angry?

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.160
Babu, you listen to me at least. Babu!

01:14:27.330 --> 01:14:28.370
Hey,

01:14:29.370 --> 01:14:32.790
is Mhatre's daughter very special?

01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:35.830
Didn't you get us humiliated
when you took us there?

01:14:39.410 --> 01:14:40.620
Keep this in mind.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.500
If you don't mend your ways now...

01:14:42.580 --> 01:14:44.580
...even I won't be able
to do anything in future.

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:50.540
Whatever bad name you
have earned is enough.

01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:51.700
Stop it now.

01:14:52.830 --> 01:14:54.500
And keep one thing in mind.

01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:55.830
Even now

01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:58.830
I am running this house.

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:00.450
Everything will be as per my wish.

01:15:00.540 --> 01:15:02.250
Who had told you to go there
without asking me?

01:15:02.330 --> 01:15:04.040
- You and I are going on different paths.
- Babu.

01:15:04.330 --> 01:15:05.290
'I don't want to marry!'

01:15:05.370 --> 01:15:07.700
Calm down. We will talk to him tomorrow.

01:15:08.370 --> 01:15:10.370
I am not asking you. I am telling you.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.830
She is a very nice girl, you idiot.

01:15:21.410 --> 01:15:25.000
You tell me where I am wrong.

01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:28.580
Every time you support him.

01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:30.830
What about his sister?

01:15:31.950 --> 01:15:34.540
He doesn't care about her future.

01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:38.160
Hey!

01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:40.950
Hey, where are you going?

01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:08.250
Hey... hey...

01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:49.000
"Your dream in my eyes"

01:16:49.450 --> 01:16:52.000
"Your dream in my eyes"

01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:54.910
"My hand in your hand"

01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:58.040
"Your dream in my eyes"

01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:01.000
"My hand in your hand"

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:07.500
"Your fish is trapped in your net"

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.160
"Trapped in your net"

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:49.120
"My dear, I will make
flowers bloom in thorny paths"

01:17:49.450 --> 01:17:54.330
"My dear, I will make flowers bloom"

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.700
"By filling wind in your sails"

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.950
"I will support you"

01:18:01.450 --> 01:18:06.330
"I will support you"

01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:10.040
"When you face"

01:18:10.370 --> 01:18:13.410
"problems in your life"

01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:16.000
"When you face problems in your life"

01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:19.250
"I feel like crying?

01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:22.160
"When you face problems in your life"

01:18:22.250 --> 01:18:25.450
"I feel like crying?

01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:31.660
"Your fish is trapped in your net"

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:39.950
"She got trapped in it"

01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:27.830
"All my promises to you"

01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:30.660
"I will always remember, my dear"

01:19:31.450 --> 01:19:35.950
"I will always remember, my dear"

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.910
"The home of our love"

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.000
"You will see it in my eyes"

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:48.660
"You will see it in my eyes"

01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:55.250
"To your unspoken love"

01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:58.160
"To your unspoken love"

01:19:58.250 --> 01:20:01.370
"My heart calls out"

01:20:01.450 --> 01:20:04.120
"To your unspoken love"

01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:07.120
"My heart calls out"

01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:14.120
"Your fish is trapped in your net"

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.910
"She got trapped in it"

01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:28.000
"Your dream in my eyes"

01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:31.450
"My hand in your hand"

01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:37.160
"Your fish is trapped in your net"

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.290
"She got trapped in it"

01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:56.700
All okay, Babu Seth? - Yes.

01:20:57.410 --> 01:20:59.580
Barkya, make strong tea for us.

01:21:00.870 --> 01:21:03.540
- Offer free tea to everybody.
- So Mr. Contractor, why did you come here?

01:21:03.620 --> 01:21:05.870
You could have called me.
I would have come to your office.

01:21:05.950 --> 01:21:07.290
Who is he?

01:21:07.370 --> 01:21:08.750
He is Babu Bhoir.

01:21:08.830 --> 01:21:10.790
He had a quarrel with Anil Tandel.

01:21:10.870 --> 01:21:12.450
- What really?
- Yeah.

01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:14.950
- He lost everything because of that.
- Yes, everything is going on smoothly.

01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:16.620
The sand business. His love.

01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:17.660
He lost everything.

01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:19.750
- Then his father got him married to a girl.
- Okay, fine. How are you?

01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:21.830
- But people still respect him a lot.
- Yes, things are fine.

01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:23.660
- Whenever he comes here,
- Yes, fine.

01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:26.000
- people tell him their problems.
- Yes.

01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:26.580
Okay.

01:21:26.660 --> 01:21:29.120
- And he tries his best for them.
- Everything is fine.

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:29.950
I see.

01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:41.290
Would you like to have tea?

01:21:41.410 --> 01:21:42.580
I will pay for it.

01:21:44.750 --> 01:21:45.580
Come.

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:49.290
Babu sheth,

01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:51.500
if you want to ditch rikshaw
and ride in a car,

01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:53.040
then collaborate with me.

01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:54.580
Both of us will benefit.

01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:56.750
I have got tender for airport.

01:21:57.830 --> 01:22:02.040
You need not ask me how
and why I got it.

01:22:02.370 --> 01:22:03.910
I am able enough.

01:22:04.830 --> 01:22:09.330
But you have the power
to complete the job.

01:22:09.870 --> 01:22:15.500
And I need not ask when
and how you will do the job.

01:22:15.870 --> 01:22:19.250
Because I am certain
that only you can complete this job.

01:22:19.660 --> 01:22:21.910
So are you doing it?

01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:31.000
I am no longer the kind
of person you have heard about.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.830
I don't think I am of any use to you.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.330
I have stopped doing dishonest work.

01:22:38.450 --> 01:22:39.830
Babu,

01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:46.120
you know that the rage is your mind
is stronger than earlier.

01:22:46.910 --> 01:22:49.830
But the rage doesn't show on your face.

01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:53.160
That is what I want.

01:22:56.410 --> 01:22:57.660
What am I supposed to do?

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.700
I want to start a partnership.

01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:08.790
You will decide the name of the company.

01:23:45.370 --> 01:23:51.250
"Your dream in my eyes"

01:23:51.370 --> 01:23:53.920
"Your dream in my eyes"

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.000
"My hand in your hand"

01:23:57.330 --> 01:23:59.920
"Your dream in my eyes"

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.160
"My hand in your hand"

01:24:03.250 --> 01:24:09.500
"Your fish is trapped in your net"

01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:17.450
"Trapped in your net"

01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:30.200
This is our real beginning, Sunita.

01:24:36.290 --> 01:24:37.330
I will wait.

01:24:50.790 --> 01:24:52.000
Have you forgotten me?

01:24:52.290 --> 01:24:53.830
It is not possible to forget you.

01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:56.750
But if I keep thinking of you,

01:24:57.910 --> 01:24:59.370
it will be injustice to Sunita.

01:25:00.540 --> 01:25:01.700
What have I done?

01:25:01.870 --> 01:25:02.830
Great.

01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:06.660
Are you asking me after all that happened?

01:25:06.910 --> 01:25:07.750
What do you mean?

01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:10.660
My parents' insult right in front of you.

01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:13.040
Have you forgotten that?

01:25:19.370 --> 01:25:21.750
But you got married before I did, right?

01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:29.830
Didn't your parents want
a son-in-law owning nine dumpers?

01:26:41.950 --> 01:26:43.450
Doesn't it hurt you?

01:26:47.950 --> 01:26:48.910
What?

01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:54.790
My behaviour.

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:07.250
Once you understand the relationship...

01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:10.410
...no space remains for any kind of hurt.

01:27:14.330 --> 01:27:15.450
After

01:27:17.790 --> 01:27:22.450
marriage you never insisted
on expressing your love to her.

01:27:24.410 --> 01:27:25.410
It means

01:27:26.830 --> 01:27:28.790
you respect your love.

01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:33.330
Why should I force my love on you?

01:27:39.410 --> 01:27:41.290
I too respect my love.

01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:48.750
Sunita, it is amazing.

01:27:50.910 --> 01:27:52.370
You are uneducated,

01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:56.120
but how come you are so sensible?

01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:05.870
In the sea, your boat is in the middle...

01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:10.620
...the two of us are at the two extremes.

01:28:14.410 --> 01:28:15.870
Now you have to decide

01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:22.000
whether to go to the one you love...

01:28:24.750 --> 01:28:27.000
...or to the one who loves you.

01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:44.250
Come. Come, madam. Come.

01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:46.000
Wow!

01:28:46.450 --> 01:28:48.620
The office is so big.

01:28:49.250 --> 01:28:51.500
This is our model of airport.

01:28:52.830 --> 01:28:54.290
The officer is in there. Come.

01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:55.370
Sit.

01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:57.910
I...

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Sit.

01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:12.370
This is airport architecture plan.

01:29:14.660 --> 01:29:16.410
7/12 Extract, serial number 7A.

01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:19.750
Survey number 71/71.

01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:22.620
This plot size is 50 acre.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.910
It is owned by Babu Krishna Bhoir.

01:29:27.580 --> 01:29:29.120
That is why I bailed him out.

01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:32.700
But he turned out to be a rascal.

01:29:34.580 --> 01:29:38.910
I have acquired the 50 per cent
land surrounding it.

01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:54.370
All the land we have acquired
adjoining the airport

01:29:54.450 --> 01:29:55.410
more than it...

01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:57.370
This plot...

01:29:58.250 --> 01:30:00.290
If you help me acquire this plot...

01:30:01.870 --> 01:30:03.540
...I can give you

01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:06.000
whatever you want.

01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:10.290
And what do I want?

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.540
The end to Krishna Bhoir's bloodline.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:20.370
What is the guarantee

01:30:21.830 --> 01:30:23.620
that it will be as you say?

01:30:23.830 --> 01:30:29.580
Charusheela madam, you are
dreaming of eliminating Krishna Bhoir

01:30:29.790 --> 01:30:33.040
...with the help of a man who
is currently dreaming about a girl.

01:30:33.250 --> 01:30:34.620
There is no guarantee

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:38.250
when he will ruin himself and you.

01:30:38.330 --> 01:30:39.580
Mind your tongue.

01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:48.120
I don't think there will be

01:30:50.450 --> 01:30:52.410
another opportunity for this.

01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:04.370
Madam, think over it and let me know.

01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:07.910
"O girl, you and I will get married"

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:11.330
"You have made me crazy"

01:31:11.410 --> 01:31:12.250
Call him.

01:31:12.330 --> 01:31:17.500
- "O girl, you and I will get married"
- Sir, you're called.

01:31:17.580 --> 01:31:23.660
"You have made me crazy"

01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:25.750
Did she really drive you crazy?

01:31:28.370 --> 01:31:33.450
How would you know about
the joy of being crazy in love?

01:31:34.950 --> 01:31:37.500
Everybody gets punished
for falling in love.

01:31:37.580 --> 01:31:38.580
Anil, just think.

01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:40.500
What we had decided to do

01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:43.200
and how silly your behaviour is.

01:31:43.290 --> 01:31:44.790
Weren't you fooled?

01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:47.410
Didn't the idiot ditch you?

01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:54.200
Wow, this is great.

01:31:54.500 --> 01:31:57.250
What you do is miracle
and what I do is atrocious!

01:31:57.330 --> 01:31:58.750
Mind your tongue.

01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:01.330
You take care of mother, okay?

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.830
I don't want to become like you.

01:32:04.250 --> 01:32:06.290
You are neither here nor there.

01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:07.910
Listen.

01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:12.040
Don't preach to me, okay?

01:32:12.370 --> 01:32:14.410
Don't preach to me.

01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:20.120
After many years this house
will be illuminated with lamps!

01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:24.080
Crackers will be burst. Boom! Bang! Bang!

01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:28.000
The whole village will be decorated!

01:32:28.290 --> 01:32:32.750
My wedding procession
will start from this house!

01:32:32.830 --> 01:32:35.790
And the whole village
will feast on mutton.

01:32:35.870 --> 01:32:39.000
Hey, rice chapatti and intestine curry.

01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:40.540
And at the time of turmeric ceremony...

01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:43.750
...full liquor bottles will be opened.

01:32:43.830 --> 01:32:44.450
Direct.

01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:48.620
"O girl, you and I will get married"

01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:54.750
"She drove Tandel crazy"

01:33:06.410 --> 01:33:10.200
Today I realised that
there is someone close to me.

01:33:11.330 --> 01:33:13.000
I grew up among

01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:15.920
15 people including siblings.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.910
Still I was alone.

01:33:19.700 --> 01:33:20.910
Incomplete.

01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:29.910
Today I felt as if I am complete.

01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:51.540
I cannot speak like you.

01:33:53.700 --> 01:33:57.950
But hold my hand till the end.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.120
Only if you promise me something.

01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:10.040
Hanuman's mace and Babu's
promise will never break.

01:34:39.910 --> 01:34:42.540
Come. Madam, he is my friend.

01:34:42.660 --> 01:34:44.410
About my commission...

01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:48.200
- Come. He won't refuse my request.
- Someone who is ungrateful.

01:34:48.410 --> 01:34:49.000
Come.

01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:54.160
Damn.

01:34:55.370 --> 01:34:58.540
Horizontal word four letters...

01:34:58.620 --> 01:35:00.540
what can it be?

01:35:00.790 --> 01:35:02.540
Sit.

01:35:02.790 --> 01:35:04.000
Done.

01:35:04.290 --> 01:35:06.120
The puzzle is a bit difficult.

01:35:06.370 --> 01:35:07.660
Horizontal...

01:35:07.870 --> 01:35:09.000
- Babu.
- Yes?

01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:10.750
Babu sheth.

01:35:10.830 --> 01:35:13.290
Someone who is ungrateful.

01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:15.500
Rascal.

01:35:16.910 --> 01:35:17.700
It is in the puzzle.

01:35:17.790 --> 01:35:19.870
Hey, I don't have time.

01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:24.950
You have just arrived. What's the hurry?

01:35:25.870 --> 01:35:27.660
You made me breathe the air in jail.

01:35:27.750 --> 01:35:30.660
You should at least
enjoy the air from the fan.

01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:33.200
- Hey, Raja.
- Yes?

01:35:33.410 --> 01:35:35.000
Take this money.

01:35:35.790 --> 01:35:37.790
Madam has come for the first time.

01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:40.250
Bring snacks and cold drink.

01:35:40.330 --> 01:35:41.330
Okay.

01:35:42.330 --> 01:35:44.580
Babu, I suggest...

01:35:46.250 --> 01:35:50.000
...we should make peace.

01:35:50.790 --> 01:35:53.750
Who benefited from family feud?

01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:57.750
If we want to benefit...

01:35:59.790 --> 01:36:02.290
...we will have to forget enmity.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.750
Did you come here to say this?

01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:11.000
Just like your father, you too love...

01:36:12.450 --> 01:36:15.910
...to create hurdles in everything.

01:36:25.450 --> 01:36:28.080
Our lands are stuck because
of your lands.

01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:34.330
While carrying on old enmity,
new enmities will be created.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:35.870
Got it?

01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:41.080
What do I gain?

01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:44.950
There is monetary benefit,

01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:48.450
but no benefit in enmity.
Surely you realise that?

01:36:50.830 --> 01:36:54.080
And if you don't realise it,
you will pay dearly.

01:36:59.250 --> 01:37:00.870
I won't hand over the land.

01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:08.080
I too am not scared of enmity.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.580
I will withdraw all
the charges against you.

01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:29.370
What will you do?

01:37:41.830 --> 01:37:43.910
Had you said this earlier...

01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:51.950
I give it.

01:37:54.460 --> 01:37:55.580
I give the land to you.

01:37:56.410 --> 01:37:58.540
Police is here. Run away.

01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:00.120
- How come police is here?
- Hey, catch him.

01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:02.290
- Run! Let's run!
- Run!

01:38:02.370 --> 01:38:03.580
Let go of me!

01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:05.040
Come on.

01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:55.910
Ahmad Abdul Qazi Sattar.

01:38:57.660 --> 01:38:59.200
Age 18 years.

01:39:01.370 --> 01:39:02.450
Nashik?

01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:07.750
Savarkar Road, hotel Swagat.

01:39:08.750 --> 01:39:13.120
A waiter took 20,000 in cash
from hotel Swagat and ran away.

01:39:15.790 --> 01:39:18.250
Section IPC... what?

01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:20.450
Section...

01:39:22.830 --> 01:39:25.200
Section IPC 379.

01:39:28.370 --> 01:39:29.580
The same year,

01:39:30.450 --> 01:39:31.910
Mumbai Nariman Point...

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:37.620
...cycle thief gang's best
thief Abdul Sattar disappears.

01:39:39.410 --> 01:39:41.450
Shall I tell you more?

01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:50.790
Shall I tell you your second
wife belongs to which place?

01:39:53.540 --> 01:39:58.540
Address Chembur East,
Alibaba slum, Ward number 4.

01:39:58.870 --> 01:40:02.040
Car theft, sand smuggling...

01:40:04.950 --> 01:40:06.000
Look, Abdul,

01:40:07.290 --> 01:40:11.660
I can get you out of all these problems.

01:40:12.830 --> 01:40:13.750
Got it?

01:40:15.290 --> 01:40:16.500
Now it is up to you.

01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:20.080
Will you go on honeymoon with prisoners or

01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:23.080
with second wife?

01:40:24.330 --> 01:40:26.040
Do not think so much.

01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:34.200
Sign it.

01:40:37.290 --> 01:40:39.290
Do you think I am stupid?

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.330
Do I need to think so?

01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:51.750
Listen. You do not know
mister Tandel's connections.

01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:56.290
You and your Tandel.

01:40:57.870 --> 01:41:00.290
Connections, connections, connections.

01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:03.080
Forget connections.

01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:05.330
How was the tea?

01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:07.750
- What?
- Tell me.

01:41:08.580 --> 01:41:09.580
It was poisoned.

01:41:09.790 --> 01:41:10.620
Well?

01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:21.000
This is its antidote.

01:41:35.330 --> 01:41:36.580
Forget it, sir.

01:41:38.370 --> 01:41:42.450
Anyway, the one you want
to help thinks otherwise.

01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:47.250
He drank the tea, right?
He will die in pain.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:50.330
You are right.

01:41:50.910 --> 01:41:52.080
He would have been useful.

01:41:52.290 --> 01:41:53.660
- Let it be. Let him die.
- I will do it.

01:41:55.450 --> 01:41:57.200
I will do it. I will sign it.

01:41:57.910 --> 01:41:58.870
I will do it.

01:42:17.950 --> 01:42:20.950
This is water.

01:42:24.660 --> 01:42:27.040
Abdul, the earlier thing
was tea with less water.

01:42:30.330 --> 01:42:31.330
See you, sir.

01:42:32.700 --> 01:42:33.540
Jadhav.

01:42:33.620 --> 01:42:34.580
Yes, sir.

01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:37.950
Put him in the car.

01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:43.080
You don't know me well.

01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:45.370
- No...
- No, you don't know me well.

01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:47.920
When you know me well,
you will realise it.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:52.000
You will feel proud
of the son-in-law you have got.

01:42:52.370 --> 01:42:54.830
You know, you have found a son-in-law
who is one in a million.

01:42:54.910 --> 01:42:55.700
One in a million.

01:42:58.950 --> 01:43:01.540
Come with me to the society gathering.

01:43:02.660 --> 01:43:07.290
You will see the respect
I command in the society.

01:43:07.370 --> 01:43:12.200
Then you will know your
son-in-law is the best.

01:43:12.870 --> 01:43:18.290
Lawyers, doctors and anybody
who is there salutes me.

01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:22.450
Anybody who comes there salutes me.

01:43:22.830 --> 01:43:24.330
Hey, come.

01:43:24.580 --> 01:43:25.750
Hey, let go of me.

01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:28.290
- Hey, come on.
- Hey, do you know

01:43:28.370 --> 01:43:30.290
whose collar you have grabbed?

01:43:30.370 --> 01:43:31.960
That is what I will show him. Come.

01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:33.080
- Hey!
- Get up.

01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:35.000
- Hey.
- Come on.

01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:36.540
Move it.

01:43:36.620 --> 01:43:38.000
Leave me.

01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:39.660
Come. I'll show you how Salim used to die.

01:43:39.750 --> 01:43:41.000
Get in the car.

01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:42.660
- Leave me.
- Get me out first.

01:43:42.750 --> 01:43:44.200
- Get me out first.
- Leave me.

01:43:44.290 --> 01:43:47.370
- You had it now.
- Hey, stop. Hey, stop.

01:43:56.700 --> 01:43:57.830
Babu.

01:43:58.040 --> 01:43:59.290
Babu sheth.

01:44:00.910 --> 01:44:01.790
Babu.

01:44:09.370 --> 01:44:10.700
Babu sheth.

01:44:13.290 --> 01:44:18.330
Do not take to heart
what happened earlier.

01:44:19.250 --> 01:44:21.500
What happened is in the past.

01:44:21.660 --> 01:44:24.000
We should not take it to heart.

01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:26.540
We should forget it.

01:44:31.330 --> 01:44:32.950
I do not take anything to heart.

01:44:33.540 --> 01:44:37.040
It just weighs on my mind.

01:44:39.290 --> 01:44:41.500
Babu sheth, joke.

01:44:43.330 --> 01:44:47.540
Babu sheth, I know very well.

01:44:49.660 --> 01:44:54.660
You are going to get Anil Tandel released.

01:44:56.870 --> 01:44:58.290
I too know that.

01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:05.910
Jagan Mhatre.

01:45:09.950 --> 01:45:11.250
Hadn't I told you?

01:45:12.790 --> 01:45:16.370
Someday I will bring you to my feet.

01:45:22.580 --> 01:45:23.700
Play it.

01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:34.660
Hey, Babu. Babu!

01:45:34.870 --> 01:45:38.000
Hey, Babu sheth.

01:45:38.910 --> 01:45:40.000
Babu sheth!

01:45:43.250 --> 01:45:46.200
Madam, it is written
here that you have withdrawn...

01:45:46.290 --> 01:45:48.750
...all the charges against
Babu Krishna Bhoir.

01:45:48.910 --> 01:45:52.910
And I, that is the boss
and my associate Abdul...

01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:56.790
...are responsible for implicating him.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:00.250
- But the consequences will be very bad.
- Hey, lawyer,

01:46:02.700 --> 01:46:04.580
everything is happening for our benefit.

01:46:06.750 --> 01:46:08.500
- Have you signed it?
- Yes.

01:46:18.910 --> 01:46:20.450
Sign.

01:46:21.410 --> 01:46:23.080
- Signature for what?
- For release.

01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:25.000
The charges against
you have been withdrawn.

01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:26.450
Withdrawn?

01:46:26.540 --> 01:46:27.330
- Yes.
- By whom?

01:46:27.540 --> 01:46:28.910
He is sitting outside.

01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:02.330
Anilrao Tandel.

01:47:02.830 --> 01:47:05.870
Sand king Anilrao Tandel.

01:47:08.250 --> 01:47:10.040
Let me tell you a story.

01:47:11.250 --> 01:47:15.000
Everybody thinks that
Ramayan and Mahabharat...

01:47:15.370 --> 01:47:17.370
...are the tales of Ram and the Pandavas.

01:47:17.580 --> 01:47:19.330
But in fact it is not so.

01:47:20.330 --> 01:47:22.950
They are the tales of Sita and Draupadi.

01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:28.450
It is the same about the two of us.

01:47:29.700 --> 01:47:33.750
This book is not about Babu and Anil,
but about Supriya.

01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:36.620
Got it?

01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:47.790
And it is my wish that
this book should be completed.

01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:54.540
That is why I am getting
you freed for the sake of Supriya.

01:47:59.910 --> 01:48:02.660
But what did you gain by implicating me?

01:48:16.950 --> 01:48:18.290
Hey, excavate!

01:48:19.660 --> 01:48:22.500
Datta! Pull up the anchor!

01:48:22.580 --> 01:48:24.370
Pull it.

01:48:24.450 --> 01:48:28.540
Hey, Gampa!
Take out spades and ghamela.

01:48:28.620 --> 01:48:31.200
I understood when

01:48:31.290 --> 01:48:33.290
Santya's matter was told me that day.

01:48:33.370 --> 01:48:36.120
About all his conspiracies.

01:48:41.250 --> 01:48:42.700
Meeting has begun.

01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:43.750
Okay, wait.

01:48:47.620 --> 01:48:51.120
Mister Poddar, I had already told you.

01:48:52.750 --> 01:48:55.000
Some day he will create history.

01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:57.370
He's a trustworthy person.

01:48:57.450 --> 01:48:59.620
That is why I told you and got him bail.

01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:02.540
We have been working
together since so many years.

01:49:02.620 --> 01:49:05.040
Abhay Poddar doesn't make
mistake in understanding people.

01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:06.250
Absolutely right.

01:49:06.330 --> 01:49:08.080
He made such a good plan

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
to teach a lesson to that stupid woman.

01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:13.370
Charusheela Tadel.

01:49:13.910 --> 01:49:16.450
Who knows her outside the village?
Tell me, sir.

01:49:16.540 --> 01:49:18.790
But sir, your acting was too good.

01:49:18.870 --> 01:49:21.000
I have seen his charades many times.

01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:22.870
Absolutely right, sir.

01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:27.620
Tehsildar sir. See you after two days.

01:49:27.700 --> 01:49:29.620
For the airport's inauguration.

01:50:11.290 --> 01:50:13.160
Blood relation.

01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:18.540
Babu, tell me how a person
can test blood relation?

01:50:18.620 --> 01:50:22.370
How to check who is friend or foe?

01:50:22.870 --> 01:50:24.870
- But what happened here?
- What happened?

01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:27.410
The foe has become friend.

01:50:34.410 --> 01:50:38.120
Babu, what was the dialogue from a movie?

01:50:39.870 --> 01:50:42.580
My kin looted me.

01:50:43.540 --> 01:50:45.370
Did outsiders have the guts?

01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:46.700
Wow!

01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:51.330
You see,

01:50:52.580 --> 01:50:54.410
if the sister couldn't
have married life...

01:50:54.500 --> 01:50:56.370
...should the brother also not have it?

01:50:56.500 --> 01:50:58.080
Is it justified?

01:51:00.410 --> 01:51:02.750
But, Babu, tell me.

01:51:02.830 --> 01:51:04.160
Tell me something. - What?

01:51:04.950 --> 01:51:06.620
What will he do now?

01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:11.370
He can do everything if he wants.

01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:13.540
But only

01:51:14.910 --> 01:51:17.450
if he stops listening to his sister.

01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:20.620
She pulls the strings and this man dances.

01:51:25.790 --> 01:51:27.790
Jhamura, will you dance?

01:51:27.910 --> 01:51:28.920
I will dance.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.750
Jhamura, will you fall in love?

01:51:32.620 --> 01:51:34.370
Will you fall in love?

01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:38.330
He will.

01:51:43.750 --> 01:51:45.000
Hey, rascals.

01:51:59.790 --> 01:52:02.910
I won't be known as Charusheela...

01:52:03.620 --> 01:52:06.040
...if I don't ruin you and your father.

01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:11.580
- Hey, idiot.
- What?

01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:13.830
What were you blabbering?

01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:16.950
Wait and see.
I will kill you first of all.

01:52:17.370 --> 01:52:18.660
Well, Anilrao?

01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:22.000
Have you become a monkey?

01:52:22.290 --> 01:52:26.540
Those whom you befriended
made you dance to their tune.

01:52:27.750 --> 01:52:31.000
If not for yourself,
as least show respect for your family.

01:52:31.750 --> 01:52:36.000
Get out of the craze
for the girl and behave like a man.

01:52:37.160 --> 01:52:39.450
Are you teaching me how to behave?

01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:43.080
Are you teaching me how to behave?

01:52:45.870 --> 01:52:48.040
Are you teaching me?

01:52:48.580 --> 01:52:50.540
She is teaching me.

01:52:57.540 --> 01:52:58.830
Standard.

01:53:02.330 --> 01:53:05.330
This is the standard of my enmity.

01:53:07.620 --> 01:53:09.830
I could have given
a reply at that time also...

01:53:09.910 --> 01:53:11.370
...in public square.

01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:17.290
Charusheela Pandharinath Tandel...

01:53:17.370 --> 01:53:19.700
...keep one thing in mind.

01:53:21.410 --> 01:53:23.500
Babu and his father will still be alive...

01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:29.160
..even after your 10 generations
have perished.

01:53:31.660 --> 01:53:33.330
Do you know why?

01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:38.120
Because Hanuman's mace
and Babu's promise...

01:53:41.040 --> 01:53:42.950
...will never break.

01:53:59.160 --> 01:54:00.290
Surya!

01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:09.410
It's do or die.

01:54:09.620 --> 01:54:11.330
Get ready, folks.

01:54:37.330 --> 01:54:40.540
"Today there is turmeric ceremony"

01:54:40.620 --> 01:54:43.040
"Turmeric ceremony"

01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:46.000
"Koliwada is bathed in yellow"

01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:48.580
"Koliwada is bathed in yellow"

01:54:48.660 --> 01:54:51.250
"The girls will glow and boys will dance"

01:54:51.330 --> 01:54:56.330
- "Play hit songs on banjo
- Hey, Dadlya!"

01:54:56.700 --> 01:54:59.410
"Dadlya is serving English liquor"

01:54:59.500 --> 01:55:02.120
"English liquor. English liquor"

01:55:02.250 --> 01:55:04.910
"The boys want a glass of cocktail"

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.620
"They want cocktail. They want cocktail"

01:55:14.540 --> 01:55:16.830
Madam, you?

01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:24.830
The document you signed

01:55:26.540 --> 01:55:28.500
was not for your release...

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:31.410
...but for implicating you.

01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:33.500
"Dadlya!

01:55:34.750 --> 01:55:37.330
Sand smuggling, theft of truck...

01:55:39.540 --> 01:55:43.450
...you are implicated in all these crimes.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:47.660
You gave in writing
that you are responsible for al this...

01:55:48.410 --> 01:55:49.700
...that is why Anil was freed.

01:55:49.790 --> 01:55:51.120
"Dadlya!

01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:57.250
You have the last chance to take revenge.

01:55:59.290 --> 01:56:00.620
"Dadlya!

01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:06.370
"Dadlya! Dadlya!"

01:56:07.700 --> 01:56:09.000
End the matter.

01:56:12.660 --> 01:56:15.830
"Smear turmeric on body."

01:56:15.910 --> 01:56:18.410
"Request the bride to dance"

01:56:18.500 --> 01:56:21.160
"Banjo man continue to play"

01:56:21.290 --> 01:56:24.000
"Don't move and play it"

01:56:26.620 --> 01:56:29.410
Hey. Hey. Hey, hey, hey!

01:56:29.500 --> 01:56:32.040
"Smear turmeric on your body"

01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:34.750
"Request the bride to dance"

01:56:34.830 --> 01:56:37.540
"Banjo man continue to play"

01:56:37.620 --> 01:56:40.370
"Don't move and play it"

01:56:40.450 --> 01:56:42.910
"Body will sway and lose balance"

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.450
"Play hit songs on banjo"

01:56:45.540 --> 01:56:48.250
"Hey, Dadlya!"

01:56:48.410 --> 01:56:51.250
"Dadlya is serving English liquor"

01:56:51.330 --> 01:56:53.790
"English liquor. English liquor"

01:56:53.870 --> 01:56:56.700
"The boys want a glass of cocktail"

01:56:56.790 --> 01:56:59.500
"They want cocktail. They want cocktail"

01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:15.830
"Santya has got drunk"

01:57:15.910 --> 01:57:18.370
He is losing his mind.

01:57:18.450 --> 01:57:21.250
"Liquor is stocked up on the
upper floor in the house"

01:57:21.330 --> 01:57:23.920
"Let Dadlya handle
the arrangement for drinks"

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:25.330
"But I will show off"

01:57:25.410 --> 01:57:26.700
"I will throw currency notes"

01:57:26.790 --> 01:57:29.080
"Play hit songs on banjo"

01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:31.960
"Hey, Dadlya!"

01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:34.750
"Dadlya is serving English liquor"

01:57:34.830 --> 01:57:37.580
"English liquor. English liquor"

01:57:37.660 --> 01:57:40.290
"The boys want a glass of cocktail"

01:57:40.370 --> 01:57:43.040
"They want cocktail. They want cocktail"

01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:45.830
- "Hey, Dadlya!"
- "Dadlya is serving English liquor"

01:57:45.910 --> 01:57:48.500
"English liquor. English liquor"

01:57:48.580 --> 01:57:51.290
"The boys want a glass of cocktail"

01:57:51.370 --> 01:57:53.960
"They want cocktail. They want cocktail"

01:57:54.040 --> 01:57:56.540
"Dadlya is serving English liquor"

01:57:56.620 --> 01:57:59.250
"English liquor. English liquor"

01:57:59.330 --> 01:58:02.000
"The boys want a glass of cocktail"

01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:05.120
"They want cocktail. They want cocktail"

01:58:15.700 --> 01:58:18.000
Babu! Hey, get up!

01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:21.750
Hey, Babu! Babu!

01:58:21.830 --> 01:58:24.020
Hey, Babu. Babu.

01:58:27.660 --> 01:58:31.330
Hey! Hey!

01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:37.080
Sir.

01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:39.540
Serve wafers. Don't you have chicken?

01:58:39.620 --> 01:58:40.500
Of couse, sir.

01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:41.950
- Serve it.
- Right away.

01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:46.960
Finish it.

01:58:47.040 --> 01:58:48.790
- No, sir. Thank you.
- There is only this much.

01:58:48.870 --> 01:58:50.830
- No, sir. Thank you.
- Why are you in a hurry?

01:58:50.910 --> 01:58:52.000
Yes.

01:58:54.250 --> 01:58:54.790
Yes?

01:58:54.870 --> 01:58:56.410
Why are you impatient?

01:58:56.620 --> 01:58:57.580
Am I not there?

01:58:57.750 --> 01:59:00.410
Why do you act if you don't have brains?

01:59:01.250 --> 01:59:04.790
Every time I save you
but still you create a mess.

01:59:04.870 --> 01:59:07.330
Sister, that's enough.

01:59:07.910 --> 01:59:10.620
Don't take me for a fool
because I don't say anything.

01:59:11.410 --> 01:59:14.450
I have come here to strike
a very big deal.

01:59:14.660 --> 01:59:16.000
Tell me what happened.

01:59:16.160 --> 01:59:18.660
Who told you to give
a contract on Babu's life...

01:59:18.750 --> 01:59:20.620
...without informing me?

01:59:21.660 --> 01:59:23.660
Your associate stabbed him in the stomach.

01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:24.910
What are you saying?

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:29.370
Oh, my God.

01:59:32.790 --> 01:59:35.290
Won't it be good if he dies?
Right, sister?

01:59:35.370 --> 01:59:38.000
Who had told you to get into a mess?

01:59:38.450 --> 01:59:40.950
Who had told you to do this?

01:59:41.120 --> 01:59:44.290
Sister, I didn't give a contract.

01:59:44.580 --> 01:59:46.540
Does he have a dearth of enemies?

01:59:46.620 --> 01:59:47.660
You are accusing me.

01:59:47.790 --> 01:59:48.700
I will handle it.

01:59:48.790 --> 01:59:50.790
I have no connection with the incident.

01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:53.370
Do not show your face
in the village for a month.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:54.950
Hey,

01:59:56.370 --> 01:59:58.910
Anil Tandel is not scared of anybody.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.790
Do what I have told you.

02:00:04.040 --> 02:00:05.910
And don't tell me your capabilities.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.040
Sister, do not question my capabilities.

02:00:08.120 --> 02:00:09.290
Disconnect the call.

02:00:09.830 --> 02:00:11.790
I should fear them and go into hiding.

02:00:14.330 --> 02:00:16.250
Who could have killed him?

02:00:17.870 --> 02:00:21.290
Forget it.
Let me have a drink in his name.

02:00:21.370 --> 02:00:22.870
Hey, serve me chicken!

02:01:07.750 --> 02:01:10.290
Ministry of public works,

02:01:10.370 --> 02:01:12.830
Maharahtra, Mr. Suryakant Patil

02:01:12.910 --> 02:01:15.580
has arrived.

02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:21.330
Today we have seen this golden day.

02:01:22.290 --> 02:01:26.950
Shivaji's coronation had taken
place in this very land of Raigadh.

02:01:28.540 --> 02:01:33.000
And it is a matter of pride that
the struggle of the sons of this soil...

02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:35.330
...has become successful.

02:01:35.540 --> 02:01:38.500
If the history of Raigadh
district is to be narrated...

02:01:38.580 --> 02:01:43.750
...we will find that here the
strong and hardworking community...

02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:46.620
...had farming, fishing, and saltpans...

02:01:46.700 --> 02:01:49.330
...as the chief source of living.

02:01:49.700 --> 02:01:54.790
Agri community in this
place respects all religions...

02:01:54.870 --> 02:01:58.660
...and lives in harmony with all.

02:01:58.750 --> 02:02:00.700
It will certainly reach
the pinnacle of progress...

02:02:00.790 --> 02:02:03.620
...because of the
development of the airport.

02:02:03.700 --> 02:02:06.660
And one of a man among us

02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:12.330
who has reached the pinnacle
of success very soon, is...

02:02:13.250 --> 02:02:19.950
...not Babu,
but Babu sheth, has arrived.

02:02:43.620 --> 02:02:45.080
This is not right.

02:02:46.790 --> 02:02:49.000
You cannot go back on your promise.

02:02:50.370 --> 02:02:54.000
I want a promise from you
that I would die before you.

02:02:55.330 --> 02:02:59.330
I will face all the problems
that come our way.

02:03:01.910 --> 02:03:03.790
But give me your word about this.

02:03:06.790 --> 02:03:08.660
Don't I listen to you all the time?

02:03:11.410 --> 02:03:12.370
Tell me.

02:03:26.290 --> 02:03:29.410
Hanuman's mace and Babu's promise...

02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:32.540
...will never break.

02:03:51.250 --> 02:03:54.620
Send me out of here as a dead body.

02:03:58.160 --> 02:04:00.000
Do not tell anybody.

02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:22.500
Hey, Babu.

02:04:23.450 --> 02:04:25.120
Hey, Babu.

02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:23.410
Friendship with Agri people
is very good,

02:05:23.500 --> 02:05:26.660
enmity towards Agri people...

02:05:32.160 --> 02:05:35.370
Over.

02:05:53.870 --> 02:05:55.580
Stay here.

02:07:57.040 --> 02:08:01.370
Babu!

02:08:07.950 --> 02:08:11.870
Satya.

02:09:52.910 --> 02:09:55.370
That's the locket.

02:10:17.790 --> 02:10:19.200
Let's go.

02:10:27.540 --> 02:10:29.160
Let's go.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.080
Let's go. Come on!

02:10:35.660 --> 02:10:37.970
Let's go. Come on!

02:10:43.250 --> 02:10:46.330
Babu,

02:10:47.870 --> 02:10:51.120
don't spare him!

02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:54.580
Babu!

02:11:22.700 --> 02:11:25.160
Babu!

02:11:57.080 --> 02:11:58.250
Satya!

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:32.160
Satya!

02:12:34.530 --> 02:12:35.950
Satya!

02:12:41.200 --> 02:12:43.450
Satya.

02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:51.830
Satya.

02:12:57.160 --> 02:12:58.910
Sir, your call.

02:13:02.330 --> 02:13:08.700
Hey, I will make you an orphan
then only I will kill you.

02:13:08.790 --> 02:13:14.000
Then you will understand the
price one has to pay as an orphan.

02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:18.250
If you are one from my acquaintances
I will kill you.

02:13:18.620 --> 02:13:23.080
And if you are a stranger I will bury you.

02:13:46.120 --> 02:13:48.160
I will find people speaking all languages.

02:14:01.910 --> 02:14:03.540
What are you doing?

02:14:04.120 --> 02:14:04.950
What?

02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:06.660
Do you understand Marathi?

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:08.500
I don't know Marathi?

02:14:09.370 --> 02:14:10.500
Hindi?

02:14:10.580 --> 02:14:12.450
I don't know Marathi or Hindi.

02:14:12.540 --> 02:14:13.870
Don't bug me.

02:14:13.950 --> 02:14:15.200
Are you here to booze?

02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:21.750
Have your drink and beat it.

02:14:25.500 --> 02:14:27.080
Hey, one omelette please.

02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:34.200
Tea for mom and toast for dad.

02:14:36.040 --> 02:14:37.290
"I am a fisherman."

02:14:37.370 --> 02:14:38.450
"Waiting for the palanquin"

02:14:39.450 --> 02:14:40.950
"At Mumbai's shore."

02:14:41.500 --> 02:14:42.910
"The Maratha fisherman."

02:14:43.080 --> 02:14:44.290
"Let's get wasted."

02:14:44.830 --> 02:14:45.950
"Let's go to the market.

02:14:46.040 --> 02:14:47.000
Cheers.

02:14:47.080 --> 02:14:49.500
Who do you want?
