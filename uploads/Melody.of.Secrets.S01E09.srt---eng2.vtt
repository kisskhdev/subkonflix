WEBVTT

00:00:00.134 --> 00:00:01.174
Pleng! Go!

00:00:01.297 --> 00:00:02.297
Let go!

00:00:02.835 --> 00:00:04.206
Stop it!

00:00:04.235 --> 00:00:05.235
Let go of me!

00:00:06.075 --> 00:00:07.075
Dad is sorry.

00:00:08.515 --> 00:00:10.439
I’ll make you become my brother.

00:00:10.805 --> 00:00:12.075
I can remember now.

00:00:12.228 --> 00:00:13.537
I’m Tontharn.

00:00:24.735 --> 00:00:26.817
(Mom wanted me to learn the violin)

00:00:26.846 --> 00:00:28.366
(So I can become good at it like Dad.)

00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:37.297
Botpleng.

00:00:41.435 --> 00:00:44.010
(Mom probably wanted to hear Dad’s violin again.)

00:00:45.355 --> 00:00:46.395
Botpleng.

00:00:51.505 --> 00:00:53.181
Practice before the instructor arrives.

00:00:54.315 --> 00:00:55.315
Okay.

00:01:01.215 --> 00:01:02.846
But I can hardly remember

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:04.155
what it sounded like.

00:01:04.185 --> 00:01:05.472
PETCHKLA THAYADON.

00:01:17.155 --> 00:01:18.483
(I met him)

00:01:19.425 --> 00:01:20.868
(after following the sound of the violin)

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.126
(all the way to that tree.)

00:01:40.555 --> 00:01:42.555
Uh… Hi.

00:01:56.115 --> 00:01:57.275
You’re so good.

00:01:58.595 --> 00:02:00.105
I’m also learning the violin.

00:02:00.705 --> 00:02:01.843
My name’s Botpleng.

00:02:02.915 --> 00:02:03.915
I’m Thun…

00:02:06.995 --> 00:02:07.995
I’m Tankhun.

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.365
Nice to meet you, Tankhun.

00:02:37.255 --> 00:02:39.806
(Tan made me enjoy the violin for the first time.)

00:02:42.355 --> 00:02:44.410
(Just like knowing love for the first time.)

00:03:19.475 --> 00:03:21.217
(On Christmas of 2015)

00:03:21.755 --> 00:03:24.628
(the christmas songs could be heard
from the village’s office.)

00:03:28.995 --> 00:03:33.195
(I felt familiar with every melody I heard.)

00:03:34.355 --> 00:03:35.610
(But in that moment, )

00:03:35.885 --> 00:03:38.686
(I felt like I’ve actually become a melody)

00:03:38.723 --> 00:03:40.410
(when I’m in his embrace.)

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:20.803
(He was the final melody)

00:04:21.345 --> 00:04:22.985
(that completed me.)

00:04:39.857 --> 00:04:41.175
I fear death

00:04:42.255 --> 00:04:43.683
only after meeting you.

00:04:45.795 --> 00:04:47.305
Melodies become beautiful

00:04:47.348 --> 00:04:48.868
only after I met you, too.

00:05:00.865 --> 00:05:01.966
Come back quickly.

00:05:02.975 --> 00:05:04.599
I’ll get treated quickly

00:05:05.355 --> 00:05:06.694
and come back to see you.

00:05:07.905 --> 00:05:08.606
You have to hurry back

00:05:08.635 --> 00:05:09.835
even if you haven’t recovered.

00:05:11.315 --> 00:05:12.905
I’ll be back

00:05:12.948 --> 00:05:13.966
just in time to see you.

00:05:17.865 --> 00:05:19.559
As long as you come back.

00:05:20.175 --> 00:05:22.315
I’m going to wait for you right here.

00:05:23.425 --> 00:05:24.461
I’ll be back.

00:05:40.035 --> 00:05:41.392
You have to come again next year.

00:05:42.105 --> 00:05:43.355
Come again every year.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.650
On Christmas day,

00:05:47.005 --> 00:05:48.097
we’ll meet here.

00:06:10.485 --> 00:06:11.485
Mr. Pleng!

00:06:13.825 --> 00:06:14.825
Tontharn!

00:06:17.485 --> 00:06:18.672
You’re back?

00:06:19.745 --> 00:06:20.745
Yes.

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:24.250
I’m back to see Mom Kan and you.

00:07:57.555 --> 00:07:59.334
I was the one who caused Pleng’s death.

00:08:00.955 --> 00:08:02.134
I’m Tontharn.

00:08:05.955 --> 00:08:06.955
Pleng.

00:08:15.535 --> 00:08:16.905
Are you sure

00:08:17.775 --> 00:08:19.646
that you

00:08:20.675 --> 00:08:21.894
want all the memories back?

00:08:28.025 --> 00:08:29.595
I want the truth.

00:08:39.425 --> 00:08:40.621
I can remember now.

00:08:46.135 --> 00:08:47.135
Tankhun!

00:08:47.415 --> 00:08:48.415
Tankhun!

00:08:48.625 --> 00:08:49.625
Tankhun!

00:08:49.835 --> 00:08:50.835
Tankhun!

00:08:50.865 --> 00:08:51.595
Tankhun!

00:08:51.617 --> 00:08:52.617
Pleng!

00:08:52.915 --> 00:08:53.915
Tankhun!

00:08:54.335 --> 00:08:55.879
Pleng! I’m here.

00:08:56.355 --> 00:08:57.428
Pleng, it’s me.

00:08:58.815 --> 00:08:59.815
Pleng.

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:08.955
Pleng, it’s okay.

00:09:11.494 --> 00:09:12.505
I’m here.

00:09:15.175 --> 00:09:16.175
I’m here.

00:09:26.655 --> 00:09:30.955
What you’re seeing now is the arrest

00:09:30.985 --> 00:09:34.388
by the Behavioral Investigation Division or BID.

00:09:34.432 --> 00:09:35.899
They’ve asked for back-ups to arrest.

00:09:35.923 --> 00:09:38.177
Pol. Maj. Darakorn Decha—.

00:09:50.175 --> 00:09:51.254
Tankhun.

00:10:07.079 --> 00:10:08.468
Everything has ended.

00:10:10.548 --> 00:10:11.828
You’re alright now.

00:10:13.535 --> 00:10:15.094
But I’m not Botpleng.

00:10:29.095 --> 00:10:32.883
You’ll always be Botpleng for me.

00:10:35.235 --> 00:10:36.235
You.

00:10:38.295 --> 00:10:39.319
Only you.

00:10:58.125 --> 00:10:59.421
I love you.

00:11:01.385 --> 00:11:02.577
I love you.

00:11:05.055 --> 00:11:06.083
I love you.

00:11:09.705 --> 00:11:10.723
I love you too.

00:11:13.665 --> 00:11:14.665
You.

00:11:15.725 --> 00:11:16.810
This you.

00:11:19.295 --> 00:11:20.803
It has always been you.

00:11:27.425 --> 00:11:28.505
Stay with me.

00:11:54.395 --> 00:11:56.395
Yesterday I was Botpleng.

00:11:58.855 --> 00:12:00.083
Then I woke up the next day

00:12:01.375 --> 00:12:02.905
and I’m another person.

00:12:06.945 --> 00:12:08.483
I used to think so, too.

00:12:10.715 --> 00:12:12.352
The day before, I was an orphan.

00:12:13.265 --> 00:12:14.795
The day after that, I have parents

00:12:16.205 --> 00:12:17.588
and two siblings.

00:12:19.565 --> 00:12:21.079
When you were adopted

00:12:22.225 --> 00:12:23.457
what did you think of it?

00:12:24.255 --> 00:12:25.923
I was pretty grown up back then.

00:12:27.185 --> 00:12:28.963
So I didn’t want to be adopted that much.

00:12:30.505 --> 00:12:31.755
But Thunphob’s parents

00:12:32.685 --> 00:12:34.925
wanted someone whose bone marrow
that matches Thunphob’s.

00:12:36.295 --> 00:12:37.705
And they found me.

00:12:41.795 --> 00:12:44.650
Back then, I thought it was good that way.

00:12:45.855 --> 00:12:46.855
So that my life

00:12:47.295 --> 00:12:48.723
can finally be of use.

00:12:50.945 --> 00:12:52.475
In trade for them

00:12:52.512 --> 00:12:55.457
donating to the orphanage where I stayed.

00:13:04.375 --> 00:13:06.090
When I get to see the sky

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:09.135
and not being an orphan for the first time,

00:13:13.105 --> 00:13:14.105
it was beautiful, though.

00:13:15.765 --> 00:13:18.286
But for me, it’s huge

00:13:19.665 --> 00:13:20.883
and frightening.

00:13:25.905 --> 00:13:27.188
My name is “Tankhun”

00:13:28.095 --> 00:13:29.275
so I wouldn’t forget

00:13:30.075 --> 00:13:32.075
whose gratitude I should repay.

00:13:33.375 --> 00:13:34.375
Housemom.

00:13:34.915 --> 00:13:35.879
Dad and Mom.

00:13:35.908 --> 00:13:36.708
Thunphob.

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:37.730
Jennaree.

00:13:39.414 --> 00:13:41.415
Everyone who’s been a family to me.

00:13:44.305 --> 00:13:48.665
In that vast sky, I keep flying higher.

00:13:50.832 --> 00:13:52.119
But it gets more difficult.

00:14:02.915 --> 00:14:06.075
Thunphob had depression.

00:14:07.135 --> 00:14:08.250
He wanted to be like me.

00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:09.675
He admired me.

00:14:11.955 --> 00:14:15.072
So I had to be good to protect him.

00:14:15.745 --> 00:14:16.890
I couldn’t be weak.

00:14:19.825 --> 00:14:21.414
My parents died in a car accident.

00:14:22.225 --> 00:14:23.675
Thunphob went missing.

00:14:24.497 --> 00:14:26.495
Jennaree distanced herself from the family.

00:14:27.945 --> 00:14:30.495
Then one day, I understood.

00:14:32.275 --> 00:14:33.275
That I

00:14:35.755 --> 00:14:37.275
can’t replace anyone.

00:14:49.485 --> 00:14:51.195
You are you, Tankhun.

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:57.135
Even if I didn’t know your past at all,

00:14:58.705 --> 00:14:59.974
I’d still love you.

00:15:03.135 --> 00:15:04.912
Even if you’re not here,

00:15:06.335 --> 00:15:07.850
no one else could replace you.

00:15:08.715 --> 00:15:09.715
Yes.

00:15:11.305 --> 00:15:13.443
You are also you.

00:15:15.235 --> 00:15:18.221
You don’t have to replace anyone.

00:15:20.485 --> 00:15:21.843
And nobody

00:15:23.805 --> 00:15:25.159
can ever replace you.

00:15:50.795 --> 00:15:51.795
I think I’m ready

00:15:53.335 --> 00:15:55.261
to return that Botpleng

00:15:56.895 --> 00:15:58.141
to Thunphob.

00:16:37.115 --> 00:16:38.490
My dad’s name is Tanu.

00:16:40.265 --> 00:16:41.734
I’m Tanu’s son.

00:16:44.175 --> 00:16:45.290
My mom is Napa.

00:16:47.505 --> 00:16:49.675
My dad works for Khitakan.

00:16:52.585 --> 00:16:54.395
She let me call her “Mom”.

00:17:08.115 --> 00:17:09.966
Napa has heavy hands.

00:17:13.295 --> 00:17:14.701
Do you want to give him to me?

00:17:16.215 --> 00:17:18.003
I’ll raise him as if he’s my child.

00:17:18.025 --> 00:17:19.865
I’ll give him everything like I give Botpleng.

00:17:20.315 --> 00:17:21.974
I want a brother!

00:17:29.315 --> 00:17:31.195
Having you adore him

00:17:31.217 --> 00:17:33.494
is more than Tharn could ever ask for.

00:17:40.835 --> 00:17:44.221
(Mom’s angry that I keep being
with Mom Kan and Pleng.)

00:17:45.535 --> 00:17:46.970
What the hell are you doing?

00:17:47.014 --> 00:17:48.277
I’m going to hit him until he learns

00:17:48.301 --> 00:17:49.654
that he’s my son.

00:17:52.255 --> 00:17:52.708
Mom!

00:17:52.723 --> 00:17:54.257
Are you okay, Mom?

00:17:55.981 --> 00:17:56.981
Mom!

00:17:57.335 --> 00:18:00.585
(Finally, Dad moved us away from that house.)

00:18:00.897 --> 00:18:02.895
Why did you hit Mom, Dad?

00:18:09.457 --> 00:18:11.455
(Mom kept hurting me)

00:18:14.255 --> 00:18:15.668
(and others too.)

00:18:20.614 --> 00:18:22.665
(She killed the guy who came to collect debt)

00:18:23.315 --> 00:18:24.846
(and Dad took her blame.)

00:18:27.415 --> 00:18:29.137
(Dad knew I loved Mom.)

00:18:29.585 --> 00:18:30.948
(I would choose Mom.)

00:18:32.995 --> 00:18:34.286
Go back and live with Mrs. Kan.

00:18:35.885 --> 00:18:36.963
I’m begging you.

00:18:37.195 --> 00:18:38.621
(Mom had to go back)

00:18:39.185 --> 00:18:40.665
(because she didn’t have a choice.)

00:18:42.755 --> 00:18:44.665
Pleng was nice to me as usual.

00:18:47.285 --> 00:18:49.472
We had so many things in common.

00:18:51.685 --> 00:18:53.479
Our hand writings were similar.

00:18:57.025 --> 00:18:59.341
We had similar thoughts.

00:19:04.385 --> 00:19:06.097
He had me call him my older brother.

00:19:09.495 --> 00:19:10.795
He took care of me

00:19:14.381 --> 00:19:16.385
and asked me to be his younger brother.

00:19:29.515 --> 00:19:32.461
I will hide and film when she hits you.

00:19:33.315 --> 00:19:35.152
My mom knows someone at the MSDHS.

00:19:35.188 --> 00:19:36.374
They can probably help us.

00:19:42.345 --> 00:19:44.061
Will anything happen to Mom, Pleng?

00:19:47.395 --> 00:19:48.643
I don’t know.

00:19:49.405 --> 00:19:51.697
But I don’t want anything to happen to you anymore.

00:19:55.315 --> 00:19:57.006
Your Mom should seek medical help, too.

00:20:10.675 --> 00:20:12.512
(Pleng was going to film a video)

00:20:12.548 --> 00:20:14.046
(when Mom hit me.)

00:20:18.045 --> 00:20:19.045
You’re back, Mom?

00:20:21.765 --> 00:20:24.337
I know you’re going to leave me, too.

00:20:24.366 --> 00:20:25.283
Just like your Dad.

00:20:25.326 --> 00:20:26.941
Just like your grandparents.

00:20:27.905 --> 00:20:28.992
That’s not it, Mom.

00:20:29.028 --> 00:20:30.214
You just have to get help.

00:20:30.535 --> 00:20:31.850
I’m not sick!

00:20:33.021 --> 00:20:34.330
You bastard of a son!

00:20:34.374 --> 00:20:35.319
You’re horrible!

00:20:35.348 --> 00:20:37.283
You love them so much, huh?

00:20:37.319 --> 00:20:37.857
Mom!

00:20:38.145 --> 00:20:39.945
- If you love them, then go!
- Stop it, Aunty!

00:20:41.415 --> 00:20:43.566
You think you can take him from me so easily?

00:20:43.595 --> 00:20:44.599
It’s done.

00:20:48.095 --> 00:20:49.290
Are you okay, Tontharn?

00:20:52.905 --> 00:20:53.905
Let’s go.

00:20:55.886 --> 00:20:56.886
Mom!

00:20:58.515 --> 00:21:00.366
Pleng! Pleng!

00:21:00.403 --> 00:21:01.403
Pleng!

00:21:02.015 --> 00:21:03.763
Pleng! Pleng!

00:21:04.495 --> 00:21:05.495
Pleng!

00:21:05.915 --> 00:21:06.915
Pleng!

00:21:07.085 --> 00:21:08.085
Pleng!

00:21:08.195 --> 00:21:09.697
You come with me.

00:21:10.606 --> 00:21:12.090
Come with me!

00:21:12.485 --> 00:21:13.843
I told you to come out.

00:21:13.886 --> 00:21:16.235
Get out! Go!

00:21:16.755 --> 00:21:17.617
Go!

00:21:17.661 --> 00:21:19.137
I told you to go!

00:21:19.181 --> 00:21:20.679
Go!

00:21:22.555 --> 00:21:23.555
Come here!

00:21:23.695 --> 00:21:24.695
Mom!

00:21:25.635 --> 00:21:26.635
Mom!

00:21:27.325 --> 00:21:28.845
I think the house is catching on fire.

00:21:29.065 --> 00:21:31.130
Good! Let him die here.

00:21:32.335 --> 00:21:33.937
Or would you like me to die?

00:21:35.545 --> 00:21:37.028
Is this how you raise your kid?

00:21:39.445 --> 00:21:40.141
F*ck!

00:21:40.177 --> 00:21:41.443
How did you get here?

00:21:41.486 --> 00:21:43.312
What the hell are you doing?

00:21:43.355 --> 00:21:47.166
(I didn’t ask Dad how he got out of jail.)

00:21:48.745 --> 00:21:50.461
(And when Mom said she’s taking me away, )

00:21:51.605 --> 00:21:53.523
(was it away from Pleng)

00:21:54.375 --> 00:21:55.617
(or from Dad?)

00:21:56.585 --> 00:21:57.585
Pleng!

00:21:58.995 --> 00:21:59.675
Pleng!

00:22:00.003 --> 00:22:01.003
Pleng!

00:22:01.975 --> 00:22:02.975
Pleng!

00:22:03.108 --> 00:22:03.755
Pleng!

00:22:03.792 --> 00:22:04.792
Tontharn.

00:22:05.975 --> 00:22:07.363
Stop being crazy!

00:22:07.392 --> 00:22:08.392
F*ck!

00:22:12.465 --> 00:22:13.465
What’s going on?

00:22:16.245 --> 00:22:17.275
Let’s go.

00:22:17.319 --> 00:22:21.341
(I just thought I had to get him out of here.)

00:22:21.392 --> 00:22:23.174
Botpleng, where are you?

00:22:23.585 --> 00:22:24.585
Tontharn!

00:22:24.628 --> 00:22:26.970
Hang in there, Mom Kan’s coming to get you.

00:22:32.175 --> 00:22:32.999
Tontharn!

00:22:33.021 --> 00:22:34.021
Pleng!

00:22:35.835 --> 00:22:36.835
Pleng!

00:22:38.815 --> 00:22:40.526
(Mom Kan was looking for Pleng.)

00:22:40.548 --> 00:22:41.548
Pleng!

00:22:41.695 --> 00:22:43.850
(I thought no matter what, )

00:22:43.886 --> 00:22:45.537
(Pleng must have been safe.)

00:22:47.535 --> 00:22:48.585
After that,

00:22:53.275 --> 00:22:54.999
I became Botpleng.

00:23:08.995 --> 00:23:10.883
I accidentally shot my wife.

00:23:12.825 --> 00:23:15.370
Then I met Mrs. Kan, who was passed out.

00:23:16.735 --> 00:23:18.403
I helped her out,

00:23:18.446 --> 00:23:20.086
but the flame was growing really quickly.

00:23:22.585 --> 00:23:23.585
Mrs. Kan!

00:23:25.435 --> 00:23:26.435
Tontharn!

00:23:37.055 --> 00:23:38.055
Tontharn!

00:23:38.505 --> 00:23:39.505
Tontharn!

00:23:42.755 --> 00:23:44.286
Botpleng’s dead

00:23:44.315 --> 00:23:46.192
and Kan was alive but dead inside.

00:23:46.425 --> 00:23:48.291
Luckily, there was still one more living person

00:23:48.315 --> 00:23:49.843
she had to take care of.

00:23:51.925 --> 00:23:53.421
What’s going on, Mom?

00:23:54.045 --> 00:23:55.915
Tontharn lost his memory.

00:23:56.215 --> 00:23:58.963
And to allow Khitakan to live on,

00:23:59.505 --> 00:24:01.981
I decided to do the nastiest thing.

00:24:02.515 --> 00:24:03.603
I’ve ever done.

00:24:11.605 --> 00:24:14.410
Chomphon has studied hypnotization.

00:24:14.454 --> 00:24:16.185
We used to use this to treat my husband

00:24:16.655 --> 00:24:19.559
when he was sick.

00:24:20.075 --> 00:24:23.188
Chomphon said the moment between
sleep and awake

00:24:23.685 --> 00:24:26.926
is the best time to hypnotize

00:24:27.185 --> 00:24:29.966
and create Botpleng’s identity.

00:24:30.075 --> 00:24:31.588
My name is Botpleng.

00:24:32.695 --> 00:24:35.872
Dad likes to play this song for Mom and me.

00:24:47.425 --> 00:24:48.592
Botpleng.

00:24:49.985 --> 00:24:51.486
Botpleng, my son.

00:24:53.995 --> 00:24:56.126
Everytime I hear this song,

00:24:57.645 --> 00:24:59.923
it’s like I can hear my mom calling me.

00:25:01.425 --> 00:25:02.955
It makes me realize

00:25:03.855 --> 00:25:05.748
how much Mom loves me.

00:25:09.697 --> 00:25:12.657
I saw Tontharn turning into Botpleng.

00:25:14.035 --> 00:25:15.705
It would be better

00:25:16.345 --> 00:25:18.679
for him not to remember that his dad is a murderer.

00:25:20.005 --> 00:25:21.683
That his mom is a psychopath.

00:25:22.255 --> 00:25:24.105
That was probably the best thing

00:25:24.163 --> 00:25:25.566
I could have done for him.

00:25:27.445 --> 00:25:28.890
So you killed Thunphob?

00:25:29.935 --> 00:25:31.297
- Hurry up, Mom!
- Wait, wait, wait!

00:25:31.319 --> 00:25:33.094
Your uniform is still out of place.

00:25:34.615 --> 00:25:36.505
You’re a junior now

00:25:36.803 --> 00:25:38.763
but you’re still not wearing your uniform neatly.

00:25:39.075 --> 00:25:41.035
If I’m all grown up

00:25:41.072 --> 00:25:43.501
then you have to let me go to places alone.

00:25:45.015 --> 00:25:47.181
My boy is only 3 years old.

00:25:50.095 --> 00:25:52.126
Mom, I’ll be back.

00:25:52.148 --> 00:25:53.668
I’ll get you soy milk on the way back.

00:25:54.065 --> 00:25:54.570
Okay.

00:25:54.865 --> 00:25:55.217
Let’s go.

00:25:55.246 --> 00:25:56.246
Let’s go.

00:25:58.055 --> 00:26:00.105
(Everything was going well)

00:26:00.141 --> 00:26:02.105
(had that boy not returned.)

00:26:05.065 --> 00:26:07.065
(I asked Thunphob to meet up with me.)

00:26:07.094 --> 00:26:09.501
(To ask him not to take Botpleng away from me.)

00:26:10.825 --> 00:26:11.908
Where’s Botpleng?

00:26:12.245 --> 00:26:13.857
The one who’s with you is not Botpleng.

00:26:14.235 --> 00:26:15.363
Botpleng’s dead.

00:26:16.815 --> 00:26:17.815
You should leave.

00:26:18.355 --> 00:26:20.497
Your Botpleng is no longer here.

00:26:21.185 --> 00:26:22.345
You’re his mother.

00:26:22.905 --> 00:26:24.497
Why did you do this to Pleng?

00:26:24.985 --> 00:26:26.272
Even if he’s dead,

00:26:26.308 --> 00:26:28.214
you can’t replace him with anyone.

00:26:28.755 --> 00:26:30.315
No one can replace Botpleng.

00:26:30.615 --> 00:26:32.495
You’re the one who doesn’t understand anything.

00:26:32.655 --> 00:26:35.188
I can’t live without Botpleng.

00:26:35.605 --> 00:26:37.108
Not this Botpleng.

00:26:37.585 --> 00:26:39.690
This is not my Botpleng

00:26:39.735 --> 00:26:42.097
and I won’t let you replace him with anyone.

00:26:42.465 --> 00:26:43.872
What are you going to do?

00:26:43.915 --> 00:26:45.395
You can’t take Botpleng away from me.

00:26:55.605 --> 00:26:56.774
Run away, Mrs. Kan.

00:26:57.615 --> 00:26:59.770
No one will take your Botpleng from you.

00:27:04.715 --> 00:27:06.403
(I left him in the car, )

00:27:06.895 --> 00:27:08.221
(put the gear on neutral)

00:27:09.159 --> 00:27:10.875
(and pushed the car into the river.)

00:27:11.835 --> 00:27:13.370
Letting Botpleng’s secrets

00:27:13.735 --> 00:27:15.290
sink with him.

00:27:16.175 --> 00:27:17.188
As deep as it can go.

00:27:18.912 --> 00:27:20.915
Where did you go after that?

00:27:21.675 --> 00:27:23.210
I learned that.

00:27:23.239 --> 00:27:25.215
Mrs. Kan got into an accident that night.

00:27:41.025 --> 00:27:44.054
I left on a ship and lived there.

00:27:45.105 --> 00:27:48.090
Then I heard that the boy was murdered.

00:27:49.215 --> 00:27:52.039
I knew his parents; they worked for Mrs. Kan.

00:27:52.068 --> 00:27:53.392
So I return right away

00:27:53.435 --> 00:27:54.774
to protect my son.

00:27:55.485 --> 00:27:57.079
What about the fishing net

00:27:57.925 --> 00:28:00.555
and the fact that you tried to hurt everyone?

00:28:01.105 --> 00:28:03.814
The news said the murderer used a fishing net

00:28:04.785 --> 00:28:05.952
so I tried to get one

00:28:05.981 --> 00:28:07.115
to follow his steps.

00:28:08.485 --> 00:28:10.337
I hurt Tontharn

00:28:10.374 --> 00:28:13.297
because I didn’t want him to get involved in this.

00:28:14.065 --> 00:28:15.785
What about the fact that you pleaded guilty

00:28:16.755 --> 00:28:18.163
and ran away from the court?

00:28:18.846 --> 00:28:20.845
I just didn’t want this case

00:28:21.255 --> 00:28:22.868
to lead back to Mrs. Khitakan.

00:28:24.255 --> 00:28:25.655
As for running away from the court,

00:28:25.895 --> 00:28:26.977
I didn’t run,

00:28:27.006 --> 00:28:28.265
someone helped me.

00:28:30.015 --> 00:28:31.275
Inspector Dao?

00:28:31.905 --> 00:28:33.028
There’s no one else.

00:28:40.257 --> 00:28:41.257
No.

00:28:42.405 --> 00:28:43.566
I don’t believe it.

00:28:45.135 --> 00:28:46.432
I don’t believe you.

00:28:48.815 --> 00:28:49.988
Don’t lie to me.

00:28:50.845 --> 00:28:52.395
Don’t lie to me.

00:28:53.105 --> 00:28:55.006
Because if everything were true,

00:28:55.025 --> 00:28:57.159
everything you did

00:28:57.188 --> 00:28:58.675
would have been a waste, right?

00:29:01.205 --> 00:29:02.662
And what would someone stupid like you

00:29:02.686 --> 00:29:03.690
know about it?

00:29:04.515 --> 00:29:06.730
Yes, I’m stupid.

00:29:07.075 --> 00:29:08.134
But I’m not wicked.

00:29:09.095 --> 00:29:11.479
You are both stupid and wicked.

00:29:11.875 --> 00:29:14.185
How many innocent people did you kill?

00:29:14.214 --> 00:29:15.854
Just to take revenge on someone innocent.

00:29:18.655 --> 00:29:19.937
So disgusting.

00:29:22.705 --> 00:29:24.381
You are the disgusting one.

00:29:24.417 --> 00:29:25.417
Nim!

00:29:26.175 --> 00:29:27.043
Nim!

00:29:27.094 --> 00:29:28.475
Come back and release me!

00:29:28.512 --> 00:29:29.588
Nim!

00:29:30.865 --> 00:29:31.988
You stupid lot!

00:29:32.017 --> 00:29:33.472
You’re the stupid one.

00:30:01.295 --> 00:30:02.295
I’m sorry.

00:30:03.465 --> 00:30:04.875
Did I startle you?

00:30:07.455 --> 00:30:08.919
I’m the one to say sorry.

00:30:11.225 --> 00:30:13.603
Sorry that Tankhun bothered you to stay with me.

00:30:16.565 --> 00:30:18.083
The Botpleng I know

00:30:18.835 --> 00:30:20.308
is you.

00:30:21.585 --> 00:30:23.268
It has always been you, dude.

00:30:24.495 --> 00:30:25.945
You’re my Pleng.

00:30:31.075 --> 00:30:33.552
You’re still the same Botpleng for everyone.

00:30:34.495 --> 00:30:36.250
Nothing has changed.

00:31:19.855 --> 00:31:20.992
You know what?

00:31:22.759 --> 00:31:24.505
I’ve never thought of this place as a home.

00:31:25.265 --> 00:31:26.265
I’m living here

00:31:27.945 --> 00:31:29.275
just because I have to stay

00:31:30.766 --> 00:31:32.112
to investigate Thunphob’s case.

00:31:35.095 --> 00:31:36.468
Look what happened now.

00:31:54.465 --> 00:31:55.465
Over there.

00:31:57.675 --> 00:31:59.275
You cooked for me.

00:32:05.615 --> 00:32:06.615
Here.

00:32:08.165 --> 00:32:09.937
You helped me finish a jigsaw.

00:32:16.875 --> 00:32:17.875
At this place.

00:32:19.645 --> 00:32:21.174
You helped me shower.

00:32:25.615 --> 00:32:27.312
I can’t remember

00:32:28.515 --> 00:32:30.090
how it felt

00:32:31.195 --> 00:32:32.490
to be alone anymore.

00:32:36.495 --> 00:32:37.603
I love you.

00:32:48.845 --> 00:32:50.934
Can you take me to Botpleng?

00:32:53.645 --> 00:32:54.645
Sure.

00:32:55.935 --> 00:32:57.079
I love you.

00:33:38.595 --> 00:33:39.615
This place used to be the house

00:33:39.639 --> 00:33:41.646
with both my good and bad memories.

00:33:44.015 --> 00:33:45.559
I met Pleng here

00:33:49.135 --> 00:33:50.883
and lost Tontharn here.

00:34:23.792 --> 00:34:26.046
I used to come here with Pleng all the time.

00:34:27.875 --> 00:34:30.308
He liked to come here to practice violin

00:34:31.275 --> 00:34:32.810
before his lover comes back.

00:34:33.445 --> 00:34:35.763
Thun used to play the violin as a hobby.

00:34:36.625 --> 00:34:39.363
But after returning to the UK, he acted up.

00:34:40.625 --> 00:34:42.192
He refused to study criminology

00:34:42.221 --> 00:34:43.806
even when he already got accepted.

00:34:43.828 --> 00:34:45.690
He wanted to learn the violin professionally.

00:34:51.875 --> 00:34:55.006
How great must their loves have been?

00:34:56.555 --> 00:34:58.468
I used to want to meet Thunphob.

00:35:01.475 --> 00:35:03.195
I want to see them together for once.

00:35:09.775 --> 00:35:12.534
I think they’re together now.

00:35:54.925 --> 00:35:56.221
You used to say

00:35:56.765 --> 00:35:57.792
the sound of a waterfall

00:35:57.828 --> 00:35:58.895
makes you feel at ease.

00:36:04.605 --> 00:36:06.505
I should have asked for a star.

00:36:11.195 --> 00:36:12.446
If you ask for it now

00:36:14.595 --> 00:36:16.195
doesn’t mean you’re not going to get it.

00:36:19.665 --> 00:36:21.785
I thought you said
you were born to return the favors?

00:36:22.985 --> 00:36:24.759
Why are you so spendy with your money?

00:36:26.905 --> 00:36:28.715
I am returning the favor.

00:36:30.854 --> 00:36:33.690
Returning the favor for being with me.

00:36:45.695 --> 00:36:46.695
Here you go.

00:36:47.965 --> 00:36:48.965
What are you doing?

00:36:49.805 --> 00:36:51.261
Your stubble is starting to grow.

00:36:51.283 --> 00:36:52.315
Let’s give it some water.

00:36:52.555 --> 00:36:54.192
Water? Stubble?

00:36:55.615 --> 00:36:56.686
Stubble?

00:36:58.635 --> 00:36:59.741
Tankhun!

00:37:12.515 --> 00:37:14.948
I’ve never seen you with stubble.

00:37:17.185 --> 00:37:18.497
But getting to see it,

00:37:19.295 --> 00:37:20.381
it’s kind of cool.

00:37:21.205 --> 00:37:24.388
I get to see this side of Dr. Tankhun,

00:37:24.755 --> 00:37:27.065
the super cool criminologist.

00:37:29.255 --> 00:37:30.286
And who was it

00:37:31.025 --> 00:37:33.341
that made me have less time
to take care of myself?

00:37:34.255 --> 00:37:35.255
Hey.

00:37:35.525 --> 00:37:36.090
Are you saying that

00:37:36.119 --> 00:37:37.479
you’re all worked up because of me

00:37:37.875 --> 00:37:39.875
that you don’t have time to take care of yourself?

00:37:41.025 --> 00:37:42.025
I’m only kidding.

00:37:42.725 --> 00:37:44.999
I left it for you to shave it for me.

00:37:45.028 --> 00:37:47.355
So I can feel closer to you than before.

00:37:49.985 --> 00:37:51.505
That’s why I left it for you to shave.

00:37:52.715 --> 00:37:54.483
I want to be closer to you.

00:37:57.635 --> 00:37:59.239
Is this not close enough?

00:38:02.865 --> 00:38:04.010
I’m not sure.

00:38:04.735 --> 00:38:07.072
Sometimes I still think I’m not there yet.

00:38:14.025 --> 00:38:15.683
How close do you want to come?

00:38:28.135 --> 00:38:29.443
What are you doing?

00:38:29.795 --> 00:38:31.632
This is a shaving blade. Don’t you see?

00:38:32.015 --> 00:38:33.095
I’m not scared to get hurt.

00:38:35.043 --> 00:38:36.432
But I’m scared you'll forget.

00:38:37.455 --> 00:38:38.455
Forget that I love you.

00:38:39.123 --> 00:38:40.563
This you,

00:38:42.275 --> 00:38:43.625
who’s right in front of me.

00:38:47.415 --> 00:38:48.592
I won’t forget.

00:38:54.228 --> 00:38:55.486
You should finish shaving.

00:39:42.335 --> 00:39:43.335
Fresh vegetables.

00:39:43.363 --> 00:39:45.275
You can keep it for when you want to have it.

00:39:45.935 --> 00:39:47.821
For those, when they get cold,

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:49.450
you just have to grill them again there.

00:39:49.555 --> 00:39:52.017
In the future, if we keep chickens,

00:39:52.395 --> 00:39:54.395
we’ll have fresh eggs every day.

00:39:56.995 --> 00:39:59.188
You’re going to have a farm?

00:40:00.095 --> 00:40:01.290
Hmm.

00:40:02.485 --> 00:40:03.552
I don’t know.

00:40:04.515 --> 00:40:05.806
This is our house.

00:40:06.505 --> 00:40:07.595
We need to discuss.

00:40:19.215 --> 00:40:20.795
When I was young,

00:40:24.635 --> 00:40:26.185
I only got to eat morning glories

00:40:26.585 --> 00:40:28.003
because they grow back easily.

00:40:31.425 --> 00:40:32.861
I ate bamboo shoots

00:40:34.039 --> 00:40:35.603
because we could find them.

00:40:37.145 --> 00:40:38.825
I used to have chickens, too.

00:40:40.865 --> 00:40:42.475
But when they stopped laying eggs,

00:40:45.275 --> 00:40:46.592
I would eat their flesh.

00:40:51.415 --> 00:40:52.730
Tontharn.'

00:40:53.825 --> 00:40:55.159
He was Tontharn.

00:40:56.755 --> 00:40:58.039
Not Botpleng.

00:41:00.305 --> 00:41:02.854
You used to be able to say it more directly, Tontharn.

00:41:11.625 --> 00:41:12.625
Tan.

00:41:15.755 --> 00:41:17.254
I am Tontharn.

00:41:18.925 --> 00:41:20.315
I’m not Botpleng.

00:41:25.285 --> 00:41:26.868
We aren’t in love.

00:41:28.615 --> 00:41:31.275
The person you love is Botpleng.

00:41:35.945 --> 00:41:36.945
Yeah.

00:41:41.545 --> 00:41:42.781
Let’s break up.

00:41:48.785 --> 00:41:50.039
Are you sure?

00:41:59.665 --> 00:42:00.665
I am.

00:42:03.825 --> 00:42:04.825
Okay.

00:42:05.355 --> 00:42:06.432
Then let’s break up.

00:42:42.095 --> 00:42:43.095
Hello.

00:42:43.905 --> 00:42:45.188
I’m Tankhun.

00:42:47.295 --> 00:42:48.795
You’re Tontharn, right?

00:42:51.555 --> 00:42:53.072
It might seem too fast

00:42:54.065 --> 00:42:55.690
but I think I like you.

00:42:57.515 --> 00:42:59.515
Can we get to know each other?

00:43:52.475 --> 00:43:54.395
I’ve also found a new life

00:43:54.432 --> 00:43:55.655
after meeting you.

00:43:56.685 --> 00:43:58.737
Not putting a label on it

00:43:58.781 --> 00:44:00.519
but so clear on the actions.

00:44:01.175 --> 00:44:02.730
Gen Z indeed.

00:44:02.766 --> 00:44:04.359
Whenever you want to fuel up,

00:44:04.395 --> 00:44:05.421
you can come and hug me.

00:44:05.855 --> 00:44:07.051
Are you confessing your love to me?

00:44:07.075 --> 00:44:08.366
To a dog, maybe!

00:44:08.395 --> 00:44:10.032
I love the one I’m looking at!

00:44:10.265 --> 00:44:12.083
Thun! Botpleng!

00:44:12.515 --> 00:44:14.185
I’m marrying Tontharn!
