[Born to Be Alive]

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.200
[Episode 39]

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.900
Do you know Zhou Fusheng?

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:48.560
Who?

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.620
The account holder
who transferred you the money

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.880
is named Zhou Fusheng.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.200
He's a migrant worker from the south.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.300
He admitted he needed money

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.030
and sold his ID to someone else.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.990
Why do you think

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.060
this guy named Chen

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.310
used a false identity

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.370
to get close to you?

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.290
I don't know.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.230
I...

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.910
I really don't know.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.520
Mr. Meng!

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.620
Mr. Meng.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:13.800
Mr. Feng is on the phone for you.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.130
Are you there, Mr. Meng?

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.970
Mr. Meng!

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.050
Coming.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.240
We couldn't get anything else

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.170
out of Wang Jian.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:29.240
The lead ended

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.770
at the remittance account.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:32.760
Although there's no evidence

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.480
proving

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:34.310
Meng Yaohui

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.220
is the one who moved Wang Jian
to another location.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.340
He suddenly appeared

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.340
at the scene where I found Wang Jian.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.460
That makes him highly suspicious.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.710
If it really is Meng Yaohui,

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.010
he may attempt to flee.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:47.960
I'll apply

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.440
for an exit ban on him.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.420
The DNA has been sent

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.640
for expedited testing.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.400
The results should be back soon.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.900
Okay.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.330
What's wrong?

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:03.360
Tell me.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.270
The DNA results

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.680
aren't out yet.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.340
It's all just theory at this point.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.630
Every theory

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.110
could bring us one step closer

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.050
to the truth.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.840
Go ahead.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.579
Wang Fumin and Meng Yaohui

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.180
left Tianduo at the same time

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.640
when Duojie went missing.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.300
Wang Fumin might have

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.240
fled abroad,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.520
whereabouts unknown.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.730
Meng Yaohui lied

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.160
about going to Guangzhou.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.510
But the evidence suggests

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.970
he might have gone abroad.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.960
These two

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.720
are likely the ones who killed

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:37.380
and hid

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.780
Duojie's body.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.800
It's even possible...

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.240
Come in.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.000
What's going on

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.260
with Wang Fumin's son?

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.980
Why are the police looking for him?

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.500
You're not talking?

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.190
Fine.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:06.570
Go.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.270
That body...

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.490
is indeed Wang Fumin's.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.390
What about Duojie's?

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.990
I'm asking you about Duojie.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.890
Did you kill him or not?

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.220
Yes.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.500
Where is the body?

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.190
I threw it into Cangduo Lake.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:52.670
The fish would've

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.630
taken care of it.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.780
It's impossible for anyone to find it.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.659
That was the safest

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.880
and most efficient way

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.470
I could think of at the time.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.570
Then what about

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.160
Wang Fumin's body?

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.790
Didn't you say he went abroad?

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.120
Wang Fumin...

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.180
I killed him, too.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:12.170
Wang.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:13.310
Where is he?

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:14.480
Almost there.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.680
Two kilometers left.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.070
A sand-colored Jeep.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:18.460
Got it.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:51.860
What happened?

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.790
How could you be so careless?

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:54.600
Who knows?

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:56.450
He was like

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:57.870
a wild yak.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:20.040
This time,

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.390
we split it thirty-seventy.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:24.760
What did you do this time?

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.780
Getting thirty percent
is already too much.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.770
Seventy for me, thirty for you.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.240
Just because of this,

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:38.010
I deserve more.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.020
Otherwise, you cover

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.360
my medical bills.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:45.130
I fired the gun.

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:46.720
I threw the body in the lake.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.850
If it weren't for the boss,

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.900
you'd get ten percent at most.

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:54.120
Meng.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.880
Don't risk your life

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:00.990
for money you won't live to spend.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:19.380
In a rush,

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:21.620
I had to drive the car

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:22.640
out into the wild

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:24.900
and bury his body.

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:29.660
Just for fifty thousand yuan,

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.010
you killed Wang Fumin?

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:38.010
I was young and impulsive.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:40.410
I lost my head.

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:44.290
So, you knew all along

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:45.550
that the body was Wang Fumin.

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:47.550
Why didn't you say it from the start?

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:52.440
I didn't expect

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:53.860
that after so many years,

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.520
the body could still be found.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:58.520
I panicked.

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:00.980
You panicked?

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.080
You kept a gun

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:07.630
for 17 years

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.230
and managed to stash it
in Wu Jiang's trunk?

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.290
Why do I feel like

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.290
you planned this all along?

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:18.500
No.

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:20.700
I just didn't expect

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.560
that a moment of impulse back then

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:25.220
would

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:27.680
spiral out of control.

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:38.270
Enough.

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:42.110
We're done with you here.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.150
Go.

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.340
You heard all that, right?

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:45.090
This guy can't be trusted.

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:50.410
Even a Tibetan Mastiff bites its master.

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:53.060
A Tibetan Mastiff

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:54.190
only has one master.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:55.960
You're keeping a wolf

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:56.690
by your side.

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.420
Figure out how you're
gonna deal with this.

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:01.330
Since you're here,

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.000
why not come up and sit for a while?

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.800
You can chat with my mom for a bit.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:06.410
The person upstairs

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:07.250
talking to her

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:08.400
should've been you.

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:11.240
Don't work so late from now on.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.820
Aren't you working overtime, too?

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:17.860
My work

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:19.840
will be over soon.

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:56.850
Mr. Meng is back.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:02.750
Thank you for your hard work.

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:11.790
Mom.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.280
Are you coming back tonight?

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:18.150
Should I leave the door unlocked for you?

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:19.480
I'm not coming back tonight.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.370
No need.

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:23.250
Get some rest.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:24.890
Okay.

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:26.080
You go to bed early, too.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:26.610
Bye-bye.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:40.490
Hello?

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:48.930
You're back.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:53.940
I told you,

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:55.700
imported liquor hits hard.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:56.580
Drink less.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.280
There's twenty million yuan inside.

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:11.380
The password is the anniversary
of my dad's death.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:22.960
What's wrong?

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.030
Not enough for you?

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:28.400
Or are you upset

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.630
the password isn't your birthday?

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:34.950
I don't want this money.

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:40.030
You're really drunk?

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:47.880
Bai is downstairs.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.180
When you came back just now,

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:51.360
didn't you see her?

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.360
I'm not smart enough,

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:00.910
but I understand everything.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:03.770
I know

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:05.370
why someone

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.930
is watching me downstairs.

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:09.030
I also know

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:11.540
why you

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:13.030
want to give me this money.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.480
I also know

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:17.410
that back then,

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.880
you never went to Guangzhou.

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.900
Don't worry.

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:27.310
I didn't tell Bai.

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:34.010
After I remarried,

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:37.510
I went to Guangzhou to find you

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:39.270
at the address you gave me.

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:43.820
Then why didn't you tell me?

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:55.000
When I received your gifts,

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:56.440
I was very happy.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.420
I kept telling myself,

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.400
if my son still cares about me,

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.420
that's all I need.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:05.570
I thought

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:08.630
I could fool myself

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:10.030
like this for a lifetime.

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:14.050
But it doesn't work.

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:16.590
In the end,

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:18.500
I didn't even have

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:19.760
a single person who would speak honestly

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:20.700
to me.

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:37.600
Do you want me to turn myself in?

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.600
Or are you going to turn me in?

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.220
In this life,

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:48.920
the two people I owe the most

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:50.970
are you

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:52.680
and your father.

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:56.400
Yaohui.

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:00.830
Don't turn into someone like me.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.680
I told you,

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:52.900
I don't want that money.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:54.420
Pack your things.

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:56.570
We're leaving the country

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:57.520
in two days.

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:23.550
You're back.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:28.000
I have a business trip tomorrow.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:30.730
So I can't drink too much.

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:32.640
Just a little.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.720
Is this

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:38.960
the last meal?

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:42.150
A make-up drink.

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:46.560
What do you have to apologize for?

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:48.290
I don't think

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:50.230
I did anything wrong, either.

00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:59.080
You still think

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.740
we are the ones who were wrong.

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.480
I don't know.

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:06.440
I only know

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:07.330
that there are

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:09.000
things I can do

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:11.170
and people who need me.

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:15.090
If I turn my back on Xinhai,

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:17.110
I'm turning my back

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:18.840
on the last ten years of who I am.

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:21.690
I can't do that.

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:27.150
You're a smart man.

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:31.910
But I have one condition.

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:37.370
I hope you can let Bai Ji off the hook.

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:42.860
You know why Xinhai

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:44.260
is giving him a hard time.

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:56.180
I remember that year

00:22:57.610 --> 00:22:59.540
when I was still deputy mine chief,

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:01.430
the barrier on the upper bench

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.680
suddenly collapsed.

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:04.790
I took the hit for you.

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:06.590
You broke a bone.

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:09.270
I've always remembered

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:10.580
that favor.

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:14.430
Being too honest

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:16.580
can get you into trouble.

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:18.960
Not everyone appreciates it.

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:20.830
I saved you,

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:22.400
and yet I'm the bad guy?

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:28.730
Good to see you back.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:46.500
Who is it?

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:47.700
Lin,

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:49.310
it's me.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:50.880
Zhang Qinqin.

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:53.600
Sit down.

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:55.410
I'll pour you some tea.

00:24:57.210 --> 00:24:59.410
I brought you some moxibustion sticks.

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:00.920
Zhu Li mentioned a long time ago

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.570
that she wanted you
to learn how to use it.

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:03.510
I've been busy.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:05.210
It just came to mind now.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.340
She...

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:09.920
She went on a trip

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:11.370
to Hangzhou

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:13.860
over these past few days.

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:14.810
Well,

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:16.300
I'll take this time

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.500
to learn it properly.

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:18.910
You really should learn.

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:20.280
When you retire

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:22.130
and go to Jianshe's place,

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.140
she'll be counting on you.

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:30.460
Time really flies.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.350
Back in Mazhi,

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:34.640
when Zhu Li had heart trouble,

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:37.440
I advised her to move
to a lower altitude place.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.290
She said

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.010
she couldn't bear to leave those children,

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:42.400
and she couldn't leave you

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.340
alone in Mazhi.

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:46.140
Getting old makes me nostalgic.

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:47.140
I can't help

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:49.210
rambling about the past.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.440
In other words,

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:53.900
in the end,

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.160
what we remember most clearly

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.640
always seems to be things

00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:57.600
from our youth.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.000
Maybe...

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:04.920
That was the best time

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:05.950
of our lives.

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:09.570
Back then, we had drive

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:10.910
and ambition.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:14.940
A few days ago,

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.390
Bai Ju went back to Mazhi.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:25.750
Who is it?

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.010
Wen.

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:28.330
Manager Bai.

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:29.240
Sit.

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:31.210
Sit.

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:34.070
Can you pull up the surveillance footage

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.980
from July 23rd

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:35.770
to July 26th

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:37.290
at the company entrance?

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:38.510
Sure.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:40.240
Did something happen?

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.940
It's a private matter.

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:42.000
Don't tell anyone.

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:43.070
I lost something.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:43.870
Okay.

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:53.660
Is it easy to look up?

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:54.840
Yes. Just a moment.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:23.780
Wen.

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:26.140
This... this license plate.

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:26.950
Zoom in a bit.

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:28.240
Okay.

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:38.370
I haven't been back in years.

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:39.770
Mazhi County

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.170
must have changed a lot.

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:44.430
Bai Ju said there are traffic lights

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:45.950
and running water now.

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:47.270
I heard

00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:48.590
that soon,

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.090
across the Mazhi River,

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:53.030
they're developing a new district.

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:53.790
That's good.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:54.960
Good.

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:56.880
She also said
that she met an old herdsman

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.740
at the animal husbandry station.

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:00.230
He mentioned you.

00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:02.440
He mentioned that snowstorm

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:03.540
in the '90s—

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:05.790
more than half

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.360
of their livestock died.

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.070
It was County Mayor Lin

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:11.640
who helped them secure

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:12.920
livestock and fodder.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.570
He also took the risk

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:16.340
to apply to the superiors

00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:18.180
to waive the animal husbandry tax.

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:19.910
The livestock in Mazhi today

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:21.290
are mostly

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:22.250
the offspring

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:23.380
of the livestock he secured

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:24.440
back then.

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:26.810
Without County Mayor Lin,

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.970
there would be no Mazhi today.

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.880
I really want to see

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.080
what Mazhi looks like now.

00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:52.030
Last night,

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:54.410
Zhu Li called me.

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:12.700
What...

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:15.060
What did she say?

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:18.070
She said

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:20.590
only after living to this age
did she realize

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:22.760
that sometimes, having too much

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:23.820
isn't a good thing.

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:26.720
Money,

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:27.810
status,

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:29.110
power—

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:30.810
all of it.

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:33.880
But there is one thing

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:36.120
that's better when it's full.

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:38.090
What is it?

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:41.570
The moon.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.420
She said she really misses

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:47.430
the full moon in Mazhi.

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:50.900
She said she used to think
the moon

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:51.720
looks the same

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:52.960
wherever you are,

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.010
and there's no difference.

00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:57.770
But now she feels

00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:00.440
the moon in Beijing

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.440
is different

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:05.270
from the one here.

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:08.180
Maybe

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:09.670
the higher the altitude,

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:12.540
the closer you are to the sky,

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:14.820
the more beautiful it looks.

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:34.640
Did...

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.120
Did she tell you all that?

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.460
She said she regretted it,

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.340
but it was too late.

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:05.580
Excuse me, is Lin Peisheng home?

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:13.900
Is Lin Peisheng home?

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:47.010
Ma'am.

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:48.920
Ma'am, hey, you.

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:52.240
Come here.

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:54.720
Clean up

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:56.470
the General Manager's office.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:32:59.510
Okay.

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:01.930
Take out the trash in the office

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:03.130
and the inner office.

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.240
Be quick about it.

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:12.930
Alright, alright.

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:13.730
Mop the floor,

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:14.700
and do the inner room, too.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:15.430
Hurry up.

00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:25.630
Hello? What's wrong?

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:28.070
What's the rush?

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:29.360
I'll go find it for you.

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:05.720
Excuse me, is Lin Peisheng home?

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:11.520
Yes.

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:35.990
Are you Comrade Lin Peisheng?

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:38.170
I am.

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:40.840
We are from the Provincial
Discipline Inspection Commission.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.070
Please come with us.

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:46.990
Let me grab a jacket.

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:00.830
Director Zhang,

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:04.060
I can't blame anyone

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:05.420
for how I ended up today.

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:08.290
Ultimately,

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:09.460
I only have myself to blame

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:11.650
for making the wrong choice
at a critical moment.

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:12.500
I don't have the face

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:13.840
to go back to Mazhi

00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:14.980
to face

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000
my former leaders and the herdsmen.

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.760
If you ever go back to Mazhi,

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:26.530
please tell them,

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:29.570
"County Mayor Lin owes them an apology."

00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:53.380
Hello.

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:54.550
The DNA test results

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:55.300
are out.

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:56.750
What is the result?

00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:57.900
According to the results,

00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:59.500
the tested individual is conclusively

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:01.050
the biological parent of the deceased.

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:02.510
The victim is Wang Fumin.

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:03.730
Meng Yaohui

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:04.950
is the prime suspect.

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:06.980
Okay, I see.

00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:08.560
You guys come in first.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:09.730
Notify the bureau immediately

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:10.590
to send backup.

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:11.530
What's wrong?

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.160
I found a Type 56

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:13.940
semi‑automatic rifle

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:15.210
in Meng Yaohui's office.

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:15.800
A rifle?

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:17.400
Get out of there now.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:19.330
We'll be there as soon as possible.

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:27.780
What's wrong, Manager Bai?

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:28.670
Mr. Meng is back.

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:29.800
I need to talk to him.

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.440
Do...

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:30.980
do you want me

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:31.740
to copy the surveillance footage for you?

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:32.390
No need!

00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:49.070
Mr. Meng,

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:50.070
you're back.

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:50.520
Um,

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:51.590
she's almost done cleaning.

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:52.090
Who asked you

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:53.150
to clean my office?

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:55.150
I thought you were away on business,

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:55.880
so I had someone come

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:57.610
to give it a thorough cleaning.

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:00.010
Ma'am,

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:00.720
Mr. Meng is back.

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:01.460
Come out.

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:06.170
It's fine.

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:07.800
You can go do your work.

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:08.110
Okay.

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:09.710
Call me if you need anything.

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:24.130
Take this away, too.

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:33.110
[Mine No. 2 Cash Ledger
of Xinhai Coal Mine]

00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:40.490
Are you going back empty-handed?

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:47.600
You're late.

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:49.640
The stuff in the secure records room

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:50.970
has already been moved.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.810
I've been with Feng Keqing
for over ten years.

00:38:57.090 --> 00:38:58.300
I know him too well.

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:05.360
Go right now

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:07.420
and wipe the accounts

00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:09.230
in the confidential room.

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:10.610
And Bai Chun

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:13.000
has been with me for ten years.

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:15.180
I know exactly

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:17.890
what he's thinking, too.

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.460
You're a smart person.

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:29.820
And you know exactly

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:31.960
what I'm thinking.

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:34.920
I was never going

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:36.750
to work for Feng Keqing forever.

00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:39.510
These are

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:41.710
the surveillance records and accounts

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:42.980
from Xinhai Coal Mine.

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:45.220
He doesn't know I kept a backup.

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:47.710
These are enough to prove

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:49.910
the illegal mining at Xinhai Coal Mine.

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:09.010
I have only one request.

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:16.280
Please

00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:19.610
give me two days.

00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:23.510
You want to be a good person

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:25.070
report Xinhai

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:27.210
and then just walk away?

00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:32.380
I beg you.

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:35.440
Please give me a chance.

00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:41.980
I originally planned

00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:44.540
to send these things
to Reporter Shao in two days.

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:45.600
Since you're here,

00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:48.030
giving them to you is the same.

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:50.090
With these,

00:40:50.730 --> 00:40:51.210
you won't have to

00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:52.260
dig any further.

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:19.360
You're right.

00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:21.550
I didn't expect

00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:23.000
my work to end

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.800
even faster than I imagined.

00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:30.090
I will treat these

00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:31.520
as if I got them

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:33.150
from the confidential room.

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:39.270
Thank you.

00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:42.650
That's a huge favor you're doing

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:43.220
for me.

00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:46.790
And thank you on behalf of my mom.

00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:47.810
Don't say that.

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:50.610
I'm not even sure

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:52.470
if I can give you two days.

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:55.870
Okay.

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:01.510
See you.

00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:06.310
Maybe I shouldn't say, "See you."

00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:16.550
See you.

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:35.410
Bai.

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:40.960
You left something behind.

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:54.990
That's not mine.

00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:58.050
It is.

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:02.190
Because you knew

00:43:02.970 --> 00:43:04.220
that kind of oil

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:07.030
wouldn't be used on hinges.
