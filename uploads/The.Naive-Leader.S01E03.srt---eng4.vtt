WEBVTT

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.560
Young Mistress

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:49.079
The Old Master

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:52.000
Look at this

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:06.599
Young Mistress

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.319
I think the Eldest Young Master

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.079
would be more comfortable staying in his own room

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.199
Since he can't enter the Ancestral hall anyway

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.560
Then I'll go put it there

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.800
Let's go back and sit down

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.680
It's cold at night, you might catch a chill

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:31.639
Don't worry about me

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:34.360
The Eldest Young Master is gone

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.759
Why torture yourself like this?

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.840
I should have gone with him

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:43.120
Leaving me all alone

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.560
How am I supposed to live?

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:48.159
Please don't cry

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:50.719
I'll go get you a coat

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.800
Yu Zhen

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.199
Wait for me to come back for you

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.600
Simpleton

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:52.720
Is that you, Simpleton?

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.759
Young Mistress, why are you here?

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.720
Simpleton

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.800
My Simpleton

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.399
Why did you leave all by yourself?

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.360
Take me with you, Simpleton

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:28.680
Young Mistress, don't be too sad and heartbroken

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:32.040
What if you cry yourself sick?

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:39.360
Eldest Young Master

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:41.439
Is he really just...

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:45.759
Is there any possibility

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.920
How could that be possible?

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:50.120
That soil was packed so tight

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.839
But what if?

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.639
Is there really no chance at all?

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:57.000
Young Mistress

00:05:57.319 --> 00:05:59.759
Stop letting your imagination run wild all day

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.199
And don't mention this in front of The Old Master

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:04.879
Right now

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:07.600
He can't take any more shocks

00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:09.120
Young Mistress

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.800
Let's go, let's go back inside

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:32.839
All rise

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:36.560
Take him to the execution ground

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.720
Simpleton, Simpleton

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.160
Simpleton, you can't leave

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.279
What will I do if you leave?

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.959
Eldest Young Master, I'm sorry

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.199
Eldest Young Master

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.959
I hope you

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:52.160
have a fool's luck

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:06.160
Guests upstairs, guests downstairs

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:09.160
Listen to this waiter's declaration

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.639
If you need to dump, there's paper

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:15.519
Don't tear up my bamboo mats

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:18.680
If you need to piss, there's a pot

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.279
Don't draw a map on the bed

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:24.800
If you need to fart, use a jar

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.519
Don't let out silent smoke in bed

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:33.720
You've finished all the wine

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:37.800
Guests upstairs, guests downstairs

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.600
Listen to this waiter's declaration

00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:43.920
If you need to dump, there's paper

00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:47.319
Don't tear up my bamboo mats

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.959
If you need to piss, there's a pot

00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:53.720
Don't draw a map on the bed

00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:56.079
If you need to fart, there's...

00:07:58.079 --> 00:07:59.920
Where did my twice-cooked pork go?

00:08:01.319 --> 00:08:02.639
Where do you think you're running?

00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:04.839
Let me tell you

00:08:05.759 --> 00:08:08.839
You'll never get away!

00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:10.319
Get out here

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.319
Gold

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.120
Gold

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.480
Heavy reward for missing son

00:08:20.079 --> 00:08:22.199
Which family's kid ran away?

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.720
Little dirty face

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.600
Did you just come back from catching mudfish?

00:08:28.279 --> 00:08:29.199
When it comes to finding people

00:08:29.279 --> 00:08:31.240
My eyes are the sharpest

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.160
Which family's young master is this?

00:08:33.879 --> 00:08:35.560
So I can claim the reward later

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.759
And not know which door to knock on

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.440
Weiyuan rice! Weiyuan rice!

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.440
You can stuff down three bowls in one go!

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.240
It smells so good!

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.799
Zhongjiang noodles! Zhongjiang noodles!

00:08:54.799 --> 00:08:56.559
Every strand is perfect!

00:08:56.679 --> 00:08:58.799
They don't get mushy and look great!

00:08:59.559 --> 00:09:00.639
Cook me a bowl, will you?

00:09:00.879 --> 00:09:01.879
Sure thing, just take a seat.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.679
It'll be ready in a jiffy.

00:09:02.679 --> 00:09:05.840
Eight-Treasure Fried Cakes! Eight-Treasure Fried Cakes!

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.960
Delicious Eight-Treasure Fried Cakes!

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.360
That's exactly right.

00:09:11.399 --> 00:09:13.000
The three division commanders stopped fighting.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.120
But the bandits are making even more trouble.

00:09:15.399 --> 00:09:16.000
Do you guys know?

00:09:16.039 --> 00:09:17.320
That Ma Laohu...

00:09:17.759 --> 00:09:19.159
In the underworld, they call him...

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.679
The man-eating Living Yama!

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.039
Those three commanders aren't pushovers.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.000
So why can't they catch that bandit Ma Laohu?

00:09:25.039 --> 00:09:26.320
They haven't got a clue what to do.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.360
You're just a traveler passing through.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.039
You don't know the ins and outs of this place.

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:33.000
That Ma Laohu hides right inside...

00:09:33.159 --> 00:09:34.679
The mountains of the Tri-border Badlands.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.879
He robs money here, then hides on the other bank.

00:09:37.039 --> 00:09:39.000
Kills people there, then hides over here.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.360
The three armies have a prior agreement.

00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:42.879
No crossing borders.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.759
So tell me, how can they suppress the bandits?

00:09:44.759 --> 00:09:46.039
How could they?

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.759
Absurd times, different skies for different places.

00:09:51.039 --> 00:09:53.519
Kill someone here, run to the other side,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.559
and you get off scot-free.

00:09:55.919 --> 00:09:56.840
Ain't that the truth.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.039
If you ask me, those bandits...

00:09:58.679 --> 00:10:00.039
Are gonna be hard to wipe out.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:05.919
Boatman!

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.799
How much to take me across the river?

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.480
Your money's no good here.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.519
You saying this isn't money?

00:10:13.759 --> 00:10:15.320
It is money, sure.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.639
But on the other bank, they won't accept it.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.080
That's weird.

00:10:19.799 --> 00:10:21.480
Don't people on the other side use money?

00:10:21.639 --> 00:10:23.240
The other side is Division Commander Chen's territory.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.639
He has his own silver dollars.

00:10:24.639 --> 00:10:26.759
Yours are from Division Commander Liao's territory.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.240
They don't circulate in both places.

00:10:28.399 --> 00:10:30.679
Only Yuan Shikai dollars and gold bars work everywhere.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.039
Weiyuan rice! Weiyuan rice!

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.159
You can stuff down three bowls in one go!

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.519
It smells so good!

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:45.559
Weiyuan rice! Weiyuan rice!

00:10:46.159 --> 00:10:47.519
So the money doesn't work...

00:10:47.639 --> 00:10:49.759
But everyone has to eat rice, right?

00:10:51.159 --> 00:10:53.559
I'll buy up all that Weiyuan rice.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.480
I'll give you a bag as payment.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.279
How about it?

00:10:56.279 --> 00:10:58.600
You're really tying a feather to a flagpole.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.039
You've got some serious gall!

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.960
With that much rice,

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.279
if I help you ship it across,

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.519
that's smuggling.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.440
If I get caught, I'll end up in the clink.

00:11:06.559 --> 00:11:07.960
What smuggling?

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.159
It's rice for my own consumption.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.039
Tell you what, I'll give you two bags.

00:11:12.159 --> 00:11:13.440
Who's gonna believe that story?

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.080
One person eating all that rice?

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.519
I'm just an ordinary boatman.

00:11:17.679 --> 00:11:19.080
I don't want to wade into your muddy waters.

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:20.120
Find someone else.

00:11:20.639 --> 00:11:21.399
Three bags.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.799
Three bags. If anything happens, it's on me.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.919
Even if you gave me eight bags,

00:11:24.919 --> 00:11:26.039
I wouldn't dare make the run.

00:11:26.279 --> 00:11:27.919
If I actually took that across for you,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.679
I'd be like a clay idol crossing a river—

00:11:29.879 --> 00:11:31.360
unable to even save myself.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.960
Immortals of the Three Realms, boundless power

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.840
We hasten to welcome you

00:11:51.559 --> 00:11:54.200
All great deities descending

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.480
Deities, please form a line

00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.879
Don't crowd together for a meeting

00:11:59.879 --> 00:12:02.039
Lest you step on each other's backs

00:12:02.799 --> 00:12:05.279
Jade Emperor, possess this body

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:12.360
Urgently order Guanyin Bodhisattva

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:18.320
To come and resolve your suffering

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.399
Resolve suffering

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.480
Oh, Heavens

00:12:23.879 --> 00:12:25.840
Please make the waters recede quickly

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.720
Let the crops come back to life

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.000
Water God, have mercy

00:12:31.279 --> 00:12:34.639
Don't drown all my grain

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.919
Buddha, save us

00:12:37.919 --> 00:12:41.000
We have no food left at home

00:12:42.279 --> 00:12:44.080
Bodhisattva protect us

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.559
My Buddha is merciful, saving all beings

00:12:53.879 --> 00:12:56.879
Namo Amitabha

00:12:58.759 --> 00:13:00.600
How did you come up with this?

00:13:00.919 --> 00:13:02.519
Dressed up like that now

00:13:02.799 --> 00:13:03.879
If we get caught

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
We'll say it's rations for the temple

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.279
They surely won't say you're smuggling

00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:09.159
Right?

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:14.240
It can be sensed, not told

00:13:14.279 --> 00:13:14.799
Right?

00:13:15.879 --> 00:13:18.159
Amitabha

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.000
You arrogant little beggar

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.879
You caused our village to flood

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.320
Why blame me?

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.559
You kid, in our village

00:13:26.559 --> 00:13:28.360
Dried your underpants on the Dragon King's head

00:13:28.759 --> 00:13:31.480
The water didn't rise, nor was there a discharge

00:13:31.639 --> 00:13:32.799
It just rained for a few days

00:13:32.879 --> 00:13:34.240
Everywhere else is fine

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.159
Only our village got flooded

00:13:36.159 --> 00:13:38.480
If it's not you, who is it?

00:13:38.559 --> 00:13:40.639
That's a problem with your village's canal

00:13:41.039 --> 00:13:43.200
Must have cut corners when building it

00:13:43.399 --> 00:13:44.320
You can't blame me

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.679
I think you're a turtle eating coal

00:13:47.039 --> 00:13:48.559
You black-hearted bastard

00:13:48.759 --> 00:13:49.879
How dare you!

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.039
Today

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.039
I'm going to sacrifice you to the Dragon King

00:13:53.039 --> 00:13:55.440
To appease his anger

00:13:59.159 --> 00:14:01.000
Don't touch me, I ain't afraid to die

00:14:02.559 --> 00:14:04.679
In eighteen years, I'll be a hero again

00:14:05.919 --> 00:14:06.679
Mom

00:14:06.919 --> 00:14:08.879
I'm coming to join you

00:14:10.519 --> 00:14:12.000
The Bodhisattva's working miracles!

00:14:22.799 --> 00:14:25.399
Just monks, what's the fuss?

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.840
Those bags on the boat

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.080
Look like rice!

00:14:30.159 --> 00:14:31.720
We are saved! Saved!

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.399
The Bodhisattva has manifested!

00:14:33.519 --> 00:14:35.279
The Bodhisattva has manifested!

00:14:36.759 --> 00:14:37.639
Don't go!

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:40.320
You haven't paid for the immortals' meal yet!

00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:43.360
What? What? What?

00:14:43.559 --> 00:14:44.120
What?

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.360
Master

00:14:48.759 --> 00:14:50.759
I knew you came to do good deeds

00:14:50.879 --> 00:14:53.519
You're giving our whole village a way to survive

00:14:53.519 --> 00:14:55.639
What? That's not what I meant

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.720
We can carry it

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.799
No need to trouble you, Master

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.360
I know, living Bodhisattva

00:15:07.799 --> 00:15:09.360
You are too generous

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.440
This is simply sending charcoal in snow

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.840
My child is saved

00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:17.919
Thanks to you. Thank you, thank you

00:15:17.919 --> 00:15:18.480
Okay, okay, okay

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:18.960
Thank you

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.600
We will burn more incense and lamps for you

00:15:21.679 --> 00:15:22.600
Thank you, thank you

00:15:22.799 --> 00:15:24.120
Once we get through this crisis

00:15:24.159 --> 00:15:26.240
We'll definitely offer more incense money

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.000
Fine, fine, fine

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.279
Amitabha. Thank you, thank you

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.440
You go back first

00:15:31.759 --> 00:15:33.000
I'll go get you something to eat

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.159
Good, good, good

00:15:36.279 --> 00:15:37.879
Monk, stealing my rice bowl?

00:15:38.799 --> 00:15:41.200
Those are refugees, no profit to be made

00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:43.240
Look clearly, who is robbing whom?

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:47.320
You great philanthropist

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.200
Move, move out of the way

00:15:52.279 --> 00:15:52.960
Little fatty

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:53.840
Come here

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:54.759
Come down

00:15:57.039 --> 00:15:58.559
Looking at your appearance

00:15:58.799 --> 00:16:00.120
Doesn't look like you've gone hungry

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.600
I ate Guanyin soil

00:16:01.759 --> 00:16:03.639
Can't shit, so I'm bloated

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.559
Don't be so jumpy.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.279
I know you're following me.

00:16:23.559 --> 00:16:25.279
I'm in a really bad mood right now.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.720
Stay... stay away from me.

00:16:30.519 --> 00:16:31.720
Have you never seen this before?

00:16:31.759 --> 00:16:33.240
Or do you think it's fun to watch?

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.879
Turn around. Turn around.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.039
When will you be able to find...

00:16:40.039 --> 00:16:40.879
...that lucky general you mentioned?

00:16:41.679 --> 00:16:43.120
That depends on fate.

00:16:43.919 --> 00:16:47.159
He hasn't been enlightened yet.

00:16:49.679 --> 00:16:51.039
He's still wandering among the common folk.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.519
What does he look like?

00:16:52.799 --> 00:16:55.360
One head, two eyes.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.480
With a nose and a mouth below.

00:16:58.639 --> 00:16:59.919
Does anyone have two heads?

00:17:03.159 --> 00:17:05.600
It's not just an ordinary head.

00:17:06.039 --> 00:17:07.960
It's a perfectly round head.

00:17:08.519 --> 00:17:10.880
And the eyes aren't ordinary either.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.599
They're a pair of squinty eyes.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.759
With a protruding mouth below.

00:17:18.279 --> 00:17:19.599
He looks a bit like a monk.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:24.039
But you wouldn't be able to recognize him.

00:17:24.039 --> 00:17:25.599
Only my wisdom eye can identify him.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.279
I've been observing him for a long time.

00:17:40.319 --> 00:17:41.279
What are you looking at?

00:17:41.559 --> 00:17:43.039
You still owe me three bags of rice.

00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:48.160
Let fate decide. Amitabha.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.079
Don't leave just yet.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.640
I don't have any left myself.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.000
I think you're a pretty decent guy.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:58.920
I...

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.319
...hid two bags of rice.

00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:03.400
Here.

00:18:04.799 --> 00:18:06.119
I'll give you a bag.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:07.759
Just consider it...

00:18:08.079 --> 00:18:09.599
...my good deed for the day.

00:18:10.039 --> 00:18:12.200
Thanks for the rice.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.839
It's him, it's him.

00:18:21.319 --> 00:18:22.519
Go report to Division Commander Liao immediately.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.319
Just say I've found his lucky general.

00:18:24.519 --> 00:18:26.400
I will find a way to overcome all difficulties.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.240
And bring him back.

00:18:27.319 --> 00:18:29.319
Ask the Commander to rest assured and wait for my good news.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.400
You just find a way.

00:18:31.799 --> 00:18:33.079
I'll handle overcoming the difficulties.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.000
Brother Fan.

00:18:40.279 --> 00:18:41.839
Eldest Young Master Fan.

00:18:43.279 --> 00:18:45.680
You died so miserably!

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.079
What are you saying?

00:18:47.519 --> 00:18:48.960
He took the blame for us.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.160
How can you say it's miserable?

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.920
What taking the blame?

00:18:52.079 --> 00:18:52.799
Listen up, everyone.

00:18:53.079 --> 00:18:54.200
We didn't do anything.

00:18:55.079 --> 00:18:57.720
Young Master Fan's death has nothing to do with us.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.839
We are here for the sake of our brotherhood.

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.480
To send him off on his final journey today.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:02.799
From now on, regarding this matter,

00:19:03.079 --> 00:19:04.559
none of you are to mention it again.

00:19:04.759 --> 00:19:05.519
Do you hear me?

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.160
Got it.

00:19:06.799 --> 00:19:07.920
Alright.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.000
I should have guessed long ago.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.640
So it was you guys.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.200
Usually, our Eldest Young Master

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.279
treats you with total sincerity.

00:19:15.519 --> 00:19:17.240
But the moment trouble strikes,

00:19:17.599 --> 00:19:20.200
you wash your hands of him completely.

00:19:20.279 --> 00:19:21.720
Although we did start this affair

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:22.680
together with Eldest Young Master Fan,

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.759
we really didn't do anything!

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.319
Fan Bao, this really has nothing to do with us.

00:19:27.519 --> 00:19:29.400
We never even entered the Fan family gates.

00:19:29.599 --> 00:19:31.279
The ones who really stole the grain were another gang.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.359
The leader was a guy named Scarface.

00:19:34.119 --> 00:19:35.400
We all saw it.

00:19:35.599 --> 00:19:36.480
Yes, yes, yes.

00:19:37.559 --> 00:19:39.000
What you're saying is the truth.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.319
I'm not stupid.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.720
I'll swear a blood oath on my brothers' lives.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:43.839
I'm willing to.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.599
Fine then, you go and

00:19:47.079 --> 00:19:48.319
capture Scarface.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.119
Restore our Eldest Young Master's innocence.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.000
He plays with guns.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.599
How would I dare provoke him?

00:19:53.759 --> 00:19:54.480
Fine.

00:19:54.799 --> 00:19:56.799
Then go to the elders in town

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.240
and explain it clearly. That works too.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.160
Empty words are no proof, how can we explain?

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.319
What if they arrest us instead?

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.680
Besides, Young Master Fan is already gone.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.759
Clearing it up is a waste of effort.

00:20:13.279 --> 00:20:14.359
Let me tell you something.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:15.720
The Eldest Young Master

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:16.960
is not dead.

00:20:18.119 --> 00:20:18.759
He is not dead.

00:20:18.759 --> 00:20:19.400
Not dead.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:20.839
You're lying!

00:20:21.519 --> 00:20:22.400
Where is he then?

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.240
He...

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:24.960
He...

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:28.799
I want to know where he is too!

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.720
Does he still think we stole the grain?

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.240
If he comes back, will he report us?

00:20:36.519 --> 00:20:37.680
Anyway, right now,

00:20:37.759 --> 00:20:39.640
you help me find the Eldest Young Master first.

00:20:40.079 --> 00:20:41.000
You won't have to say anything,

00:20:41.359 --> 00:20:43.200
I'll explain it for you.

00:20:43.279 --> 00:20:44.799
You don't even know where he is.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.000
How do we find him?

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:46.960
Exactly.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:48.240
This...

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.920
This won't work, that won't work.

00:20:51.359 --> 00:20:53.720
Our Eldest Young Master treated you as brothers for nothing.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.400
In short,

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.640
either you go and

00:20:58.039 --> 00:20:59.039
capture Scarface,

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.519
or help me find the Eldest Young Master.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.480
Otherwise, I'll go report you.

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:07.039
Fine.

00:21:07.519 --> 00:21:08.319
I promise you.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.160
We'll go find Young Master Fan.

00:21:10.599 --> 00:21:11.240
For real?

00:21:11.319 --> 00:21:12.240
Definitely.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.400
Since we've decided, we'll do as we say.

00:21:14.599 --> 00:21:16.079
Let's go, we're leaving now.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.319
Let's go.

00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:18.119
Let's go.

00:21:21.119 --> 00:21:22.920
Now it's like yellow mud in the crotch.

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.119
It's not shit, but it looks like shit.

00:21:24.559 --> 00:21:25.559
That idiot.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.240
He'd even sell out his own Young Master.

00:21:27.319 --> 00:21:28.519
Can we really stay here?

00:21:28.519 --> 00:21:30.000
Let's just get out of here first.

00:21:56.839 --> 00:21:59.839

What do you want?

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.119
It's already mine. I won't give it back to you.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.359
How much are you selling it for?

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.480
Ten coppers a bowl.

00:22:19.799 --> 00:22:20.880
Buy some.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.160
You won't be able to sell it.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.039
None of your business.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.720
Rice for sale! Selling Weiyuan rice!

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.480

My rice is ten coppers a bowl!

00:22:52.519 --> 00:22:53.440
Rice for sale! Rice for sale!

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.000
My rice is eight coppers a bowl!

00:22:57.279 --> 00:22:59.440
You're like Li Kui's axes, hacking right at me, huh?

00:22:59.559 --> 00:23:01.680
The Eight Immortals cross the sea, each showing their own skills.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.079
If you can't win, go somewhere else.

00:23:04.559 --> 00:23:06.960
Six! My rice is six coppers a bowl!

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:07.839
Six! Six!

00:23:07.839 --> 00:23:08.799
Come on! Come on!

00:23:09.119 --> 00:23:11.319
My rice is four coppers a bowl!

00:23:11.319 --> 00:23:12.200
Four!

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.240
Come! Have a bowl!

00:23:13.519 --> 00:23:14.519
Young Master.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.079
Pitiful. It is a bit pitiful.

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.519
My rice is two coppers a bowl!

00:23:19.519 --> 00:23:21.200
Two coppers a bowl!

00:23:21.359 --> 00:23:22.119
Wait.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.400
My rice costs nothing! Giving it away for free!

00:23:24.519 --> 00:23:26.000
It's free?

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:26.480
Giving it away!

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.359
No money needed!

00:23:34.319 --> 00:23:35.519
Give me some! Give me some!

00:23:38.799 --> 00:23:40.920
You wait here. I'll go check it out.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.279
Don't alert him.

00:23:43.079 --> 00:23:44.119
Are you going to grab him directly?

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.319
Or is there another way?

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.160
I need to think about it again.

00:23:48.599 --> 00:23:49.799
Then I'll think about it too.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.960
Are you selling this for two coppers?

00:23:57.079 --> 00:23:58.319
Only a simpleton would sell!

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.599
Your son is giving it away for free!

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.400
You won't even sell for two coppers?

00:24:02.599 --> 00:24:04.400
What are you father and son up to?

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.240
Father and son?

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.880
Who's father and son with him?

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:10.960
Not selling!

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:11.799
Go, go, go!

00:24:11.799 --> 00:24:13.480
Please leave, please leave, please leave.

00:24:21.599 --> 00:24:22.440
You're cheating!

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.480
You punk!

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.160
I'm teaching you a lesson.

00:24:26.279 --> 00:24:30.119
About the complexity of society and the dangers of the Jianghu.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.960
Petty cleverness isn't enough.

00:24:35.359 --> 00:24:36.440
You still need experience.

00:24:37.559 --> 00:24:39.279
Small things reveal big truths.

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.599
The mission has changed now.

00:24:40.759 --> 00:24:42.039
Keep a close eye on Fu Jiang.

00:24:42.279 --> 00:24:43.799
I have other matters to attend to.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.680
You're leaving just like that?

00:24:52.759 --> 00:24:54.119
Then I'm leaving too.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.640
Don't even think about running.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.559
I could appear beside you at any moment.

00:24:58.920 --> 00:24:59.680
Understood.

00:25:22.359 --> 00:25:23.119
Little brother

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.519
Once my rice is sold out

00:25:25.759 --> 00:25:27.839
I'll treat you to Eight-Treasure Oil Cake

00:25:28.519 --> 00:25:30.599
Save those tricks for kids

00:25:31.039 --> 00:25:32.720
You ruined my business

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.640
I'll ruin yours too

00:25:35.519 --> 00:25:36.799
Rice for sale, rice for sale

00:25:36.799 --> 00:25:39.160
Selling rotten rice, moldy rotten rice

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.759
Fine, fine, you're the boss

00:25:42.359 --> 00:25:43.759
I'll sell somewhere else

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.160
Wherever you go, I'll follow

00:25:46.599 --> 00:25:48.319
Let's see how you sell it then

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.119
Rice for sale, rice for sale, rotten rice

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.640
Selling moldy rotten rice

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.519
Grown-ups eat it and wobble about

00:25:54.519 --> 00:25:56.680
Kids eat it and smoke comes out

00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.319
What's your problem?

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.799
Wherever you go, I'll ruin it for you

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.920
Fine, sit down first

00:26:10.279 --> 00:26:11.119
Do you believe

00:26:11.279 --> 00:26:12.279
My one bag of rice

00:26:12.559 --> 00:26:14.599
Can be sold for the price of five bags

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.400
You're blowing hot air

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.519
Talking absolute nonsense

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.119
It's like catching a turtle in a jar

00:26:22.119 --> 00:26:24.000
It's in the bag

00:26:24.839 --> 00:26:26.920
You play along with me

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.640
When I make the money

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:29.960
I'll give you a cut

00:26:30.759 --> 00:26:31.400
I swear

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.240
I swear

00:26:34.519 --> 00:26:35.559
How do we do it?

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:40.119
Get me some pots and pans

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.519
Seasonings and a stove

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.400
Which house do you want? You pick

00:26:43.519 --> 00:26:44.359
Stealing?

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.160
Borrow goods, not money; favors must be returned

00:26:47.519 --> 00:26:48.960
Don't make it sound so bad

00:26:49.079 --> 00:26:50.319
It's borrowing

00:26:51.119 --> 00:26:52.119
You know the rules

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.359
How do we split it?

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000
Thirty-seventy

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.279
I get seven, you get three

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:58.240
No way

00:26:58.559 --> 00:27:00.119
I'm providing so much stuff

00:27:00.279 --> 00:27:01.720
I have to count the cost

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:02.680
Fifty-fifty

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:03.839
No way

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.160
I'm providing the skill and the idea

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.599
That counts as cost too

00:27:07.759 --> 00:27:08.720
Thirty-seventy

00:27:08.799 --> 00:27:11.440
This is my turf, I say what goes

00:27:11.519 --> 00:27:13.920
This is my rice, I say what goes

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.880
I have a gang of brothers to feed

00:27:24.319 --> 00:27:26.319
You're actually a righteous guy

00:27:27.559 --> 00:27:28.599
Of course

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:30.640
Deal

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.400
Jianghu folks never flake out

00:27:39.839 --> 00:27:42.160
You all know your tasks, right?

00:27:42.319 --> 00:27:43.640
We know

00:27:43.799 --> 00:27:45.160
We two will find pots and pans

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.799
We three will get eggs and seasonings

00:27:46.839 --> 00:27:48.200
I'll go catch quails

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.279
We'll go catch small fish and shrimp

00:27:50.759 --> 00:27:51.559
Action

00:27:57.279 --> 00:27:58.160
I didn't run

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.640
Continue

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:13.599
Little Master

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.559
I have to take you back

00:28:16.279 --> 00:28:17.400
Don't blame me

00:28:43.599 --> 00:28:45.359
Step right up, take a look

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.039
Come see my egg fried rice

00:28:47.119 --> 00:28:48.960
Fragrant rice, fresh eggs

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.799
Fresh and tasty, top-notch stuff

00:28:50.799 --> 00:28:52.480
Fills your belly, tastes divine

00:28:52.559 --> 00:28:54.319
Delicious, nutritious, and cheap

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.200
Golden bright, smells so right

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.680
Come look at my egg fried rice

00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:59.599
It's so delicious

00:28:59.799 --> 00:29:00.880
I've never had

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.400
Fried rice this good

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:03.559
Let me have a bite

00:29:04.519 --> 00:29:06.119
Better than my mom's cooking

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:06.839
Give me a bite

00:29:06.839 --> 00:29:07.440
It's really good!

00:29:07.519 --> 00:29:08.359
Give me a bowl

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.559
Come, come, come

00:29:09.759 --> 00:29:11.240
Egg fried rice, smelling sweet

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.119
Even without teeth, you can eat it

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.079
Every grain is golden and jumping

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.039
Cilantro and onions, perfect pairing

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.119
Eggs and shrimp, all in the mix

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:21.680
Even Emperor Qianlong loves it

00:29:22.359 --> 00:29:23.799
Don't go leaking my

00:29:23.799 --> 00:29:24.640
Ancestral secret recipe

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:25.480
Give me a bowl then

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.240
One bowl coming up, here

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.640
I want some too, I want some too

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.680
Not bad, I'll have a bowl too

00:29:31.599 --> 00:29:32.640
You wait here

00:29:32.799 --> 00:29:33.880
I'll go meet him

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.279
Your face is extraordinary

00:29:52.519 --> 00:29:54.519
Born with a lucky look, no need to boast

00:29:54.519 --> 00:29:56.559
A face full of nobility and splendor

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.079
Selling fried rice today

00:29:58.079 --> 00:29:59.480
Is in your destiny

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.839
As for the future

00:30:00.839 --> 00:30:02.880
Future? Go to the back of the line!

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:15.160
I am Xuanjizi, I only guide the destined

00:30:15.359 --> 00:30:17.400
Just tell me your birth date and time

00:30:17.519 --> 00:30:20.279
I can guarantee your meteoric rise

00:30:20.599 --> 00:30:21.400
Get lost

00:31:06.079 --> 00:31:08.119
You've got some tricks

00:31:08.759 --> 00:31:11.720
Fifty-fifty split. Here's yours

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.279
I'll keep mine

00:31:13.799 --> 00:31:15.839
Seems you really know your stuff

00:31:16.119 --> 00:31:17.759
You can even make fried rice interesting

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.039
Couldn't tell you had skills too

00:31:20.359 --> 00:31:21.680
You have plenty of tricks

00:31:22.279 --> 00:31:23.519
Looking at you

00:31:24.039 --> 00:31:26.559
You don't look like a beggar

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.799
Since we work so well together

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.079
Why not keep collaborating?

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.960
Mainly, I know where rice is cheap

00:31:36.359 --> 00:31:37.359
Give me the money

00:31:37.599 --> 00:31:38.920
I'll buy the rice and come back

00:31:39.079 --> 00:31:40.440
We'll keep making fried rice

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:47.079
That money will be gone in two days

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.279
Listening to you just now

00:31:49.559 --> 00:31:51.359
You must be from across the river too

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.559
That makes us fellow townsmen

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.720
We're both drifters in this world

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.640
We should help each other out

00:31:58.079 --> 00:31:59.119
Brother

00:32:01.119 --> 00:32:02.000
Alright

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:04.880
Take it to buy rice

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.480
I'll wait for you under that tree

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:09.200
Alright

00:32:17.319 --> 00:32:17.960
Big Brother

00:32:18.119 --> 00:32:19.599
Why did you come back so late?

00:32:19.799 --> 00:32:21.480
I had to get the fried rice money

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.640
All back, didn't I?

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.480
Tomorrow we'll take Little Bit to the doctor

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.400
Find the best physician

00:32:31.279 --> 00:32:32.319
With the rest of the money

00:32:33.079 --> 00:32:35.839
I'll treat everyone to Zhongjiang noodles, fully loaded

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.519
For now, I brought back Eight-Treasure Oil Cakes

00:32:38.839 --> 00:32:40.000
Go, line up outside

00:32:56.359 --> 00:32:57.039
Boss

00:32:57.039 --> 00:32:59.160
So, are we still doing business with that fatty?

00:32:59.359 --> 00:33:00.880
Who'd want to hang out with him?

00:33:01.039 --> 00:33:02.319
That guy is a Simpleton.

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:04.279
Why turn down a chance to make money?

00:33:08.079 --> 00:33:09.759
The hexagram is Kan.

00:33:10.279 --> 00:33:11.880
Positioned at the bottom six.

00:33:12.279 --> 00:33:15.160
The Image says: Repeated Kan, entering the abyss.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:18.200
Losing the way brings misfortune.

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.039
Speak plain English.

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.400
The hexagram shows...

00:33:23.759 --> 00:33:25.480
You've fallen into the water.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.480
And you've fallen quite deep.

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.720
The person you're waiting for won't come back.

00:33:31.519 --> 00:33:34.559
If you'd asked me for a reading during the day...

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.440
Maybe I could've helped you avoid this disaster.

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.160
None of your damn business.

00:33:40.759 --> 00:33:42.920
Anyone with eyes can see it.

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.319
You got played by that kid.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.759
I have my own judgment.

00:33:48.039 --> 00:33:49.799
Why are you so stubborn?

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.720
I'm giving you guidance.

00:33:51.839 --> 00:33:53.759
You don't understand the ways of the world.

00:33:53.759 --> 00:33:54.400
Fine, fine, fine.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:55.599
I don't understand, I don't understand.

00:33:56.559 --> 00:33:58.000
Then let me calculate it for you.

00:33:58.119 --> 00:33:59.839
Were you born in the Year of the Monkey?

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.440
I'm the Monkey King himself.

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:04.039
My fate is up to me, not the heavens.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.119
I never believe your nonsense.

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:09.519
Get lost.

00:34:10.039 --> 00:34:11.519
You pig head.

00:34:13.119 --> 00:34:15.639
Even if you come back with me, I can't report success.

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:16.599
Pig head.

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:18.880
The one with glasses.

00:34:19.519 --> 00:34:21.880
Didn't you predict he wouldn't come?

00:34:25.559 --> 00:34:26.840
He predicted *you* wouldn't come.

00:34:29.039 --> 00:34:29.920
Don't go.

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.159
I saw it wrong, it probably isn't him.

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:33.159
It is him.

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:35.159
I have to get him back.

00:34:35.559 --> 00:34:37.079
I don't even know if it's him.

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.119
I know.

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:44.360
Where's the rice?

00:34:45.239 --> 00:34:45.960
Pick one.

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.280
Left or right?

00:34:49.519 --> 00:34:50.320
Right.

00:34:54.079 --> 00:34:55.480
What the heck is this?

00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:56.519
It stinks!

00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:58.239
I went to find you food.

00:34:58.239 --> 00:34:59.320
Eat up.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:00.679
This.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.199
Eight-Treasure Oil Cake.

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.199
That's more like it.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.840
Were you pulling my leg just now?

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.840
You just waited for me so honestly?

00:35:13.079 --> 00:35:14.559
Weren't afraid I'd slip away?

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:15.719
And bail on you?

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:18.320
You couldn't possibly escape.

00:35:19.559 --> 00:35:21.679
I've practiced the "True Scripture".

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:23.960
I think you're truly mental.

00:35:24.119 --> 00:35:25.159
Don't believe me?

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.800
I'll show you right now.

00:35:33.639 --> 00:35:34.400
See that?

00:35:35.559 --> 00:35:36.960
There's a pumpkin there.

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:39.119
I'll smash it to bits instantly.

00:35:51.599 --> 00:35:52.800
Why didn't it break?

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:55.480
Three days without practice, I'm rusty.

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.440
I'll hit that jar.

00:36:18.039 --> 00:36:19.440
The jar didn't break either.

00:36:23.519 --> 00:36:25.480
I'll use a big one to hit.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.880
He's actually got some tricks.

00:36:45.719 --> 00:36:47.159
He didn't hit anything.

00:36:47.679 --> 00:36:48.880
That sucked.

00:36:49.519 --> 00:36:51.679
I'm starving, I have no strength.

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:54.440
I'll hit it after I eat.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.280
Where's the rice?

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.199
We don't want rice.

00:36:58.719 --> 00:36:59.440
This...

00:37:00.039 --> 00:37:01.360
Pure profit, no cost.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.280
Cow dung!
