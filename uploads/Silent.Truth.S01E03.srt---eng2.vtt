WEBVTT

00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:07.645
The murdered victim is Hideyuki Sakuma,
40 years old.

00:00:07.712 --> 00:00:09.013
It's a big case.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.783
The Prefectural Police's First Division
will be coming and setting up.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:12.951
Please do your best.

00:00:13.017 --> 00:00:14.352
Long time no see, Junichi.

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:17.655
You appeared before him as a detective.

00:00:17.722 --> 00:00:19.958
If you bump into Ms. Makiko Iwamoto,

00:00:20.024 --> 00:00:21.626
try to get more information from her.

00:00:21.693 --> 00:00:23.261
About the lie she told.

00:00:23.328 --> 00:00:24.863
Reunion for the four of us.

00:00:26.598 --> 00:00:29.300
Let's open the time capsule.

00:00:29.367 --> 00:00:31.836
We hid the gun that caused
such a stir back then.

00:00:31.903 --> 00:00:33.304
Detective Tobina came here,

00:00:33.371 --> 00:00:36.374
and shortly after,
the latest incident occurred?

00:00:36.441 --> 00:00:38.543
What I'm about to tell you
is confidential information.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.080
I'm telling you this
because we are involved in this case,

00:00:42.147 --> 00:00:44.215
but I need you to keep this a secret.

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:46.818
The bullet extracted from the body
was fired

00:00:47.318 --> 00:00:48.953
from Kazuo Kiyohara's…

00:00:51.356 --> 00:00:55.226
The bullet was fired from the gun
that belonged to Keisuke's father.

00:00:55.293 --> 00:00:56.728
It was identified as his gun.

00:00:57.495 --> 00:00:58.763
That can't be.

00:00:59.664 --> 00:01:01.466
The gun that was placed

00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.468
in the time capsule, and buried here,

00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:08.573
is the murder weapon that killed Sakuma.

00:01:42.974 --> 00:01:44.976
It looks like it was recently dug up.

00:02:34.926 --> 00:02:36.261
What combination should we use?

00:02:37.795 --> 00:02:38.696
It doesn’t matter,

00:02:39.264 --> 00:02:40.565
we won’t be opening it again.

00:02:41.165 --> 00:02:42.166
Really?

00:02:43.034 --> 00:02:44.469
Let’s remember it just in case.

00:02:46.271 --> 00:02:47.105
What should we use?

00:02:47.171 --> 00:02:48.539
What about 1029?

00:02:50.508 --> 00:02:51.342
Oh, never mind.

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.177
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

00:02:53.745 --> 00:02:55.213
We can use my birth date.

00:02:59.417 --> 00:03:00.318
What's the combination?

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.689
- One…
- Zero…

00:03:06.658 --> 00:03:08.626
- Two…
- Nine.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.814
It's gone.

00:03:36.888 --> 00:03:39.524
One of us here opened the time capsule

00:03:40.024 --> 00:03:42.093
and took out that gun.

00:03:44.796 --> 00:03:47.398
Was the bullet found
in Naoto's brother's body

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:50.768
- really fired from my dad’s gun?
- Yeah.

00:03:51.536 --> 00:03:53.538
Bullets fired from a gun
have rifling marks,

00:03:53.604 --> 00:03:55.273
and the rifling marks

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.741
of all police handguns are registered.

00:03:58.276 --> 00:04:01.346
Is it possible that someone other than us
found and took the gun?

00:04:01.412 --> 00:04:02.980
Let's start by confirming that.

00:04:06.384 --> 00:04:08.219
Did any of you tell someone the location

00:04:09.954 --> 00:04:11.989
or the combination to this time capsule?

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:13.424
No.

00:04:13.491 --> 00:04:15.026
I didn't tell anyone.

00:04:15.093 --> 00:04:16.561
I didn't either.

00:04:16.627 --> 00:04:18.429
If that's the case,
we're the only ones left.

00:04:21.032 --> 00:04:22.667
Let me confirm one more thing.

00:04:24.602 --> 00:04:25.503
Did any of you

00:04:27.271 --> 00:04:28.873
open this time capsule?

00:04:31.109 --> 00:04:32.276
I did not open it.

00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:36.414
- I didn't open it.
- I didn't open it.

00:04:36.481 --> 00:04:37.949
- Then why is it missing--
- Hey!

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:40.151
What about you, Junichi?

00:04:40.218 --> 00:04:42.120
You could’ve opened the time capsule too.

00:04:43.554 --> 00:04:44.655
I didn't open it.

00:04:44.722 --> 00:04:46.090
Did you tell anyone the combination?

00:04:47.492 --> 00:04:48.459
No.

00:04:53.064 --> 00:04:54.165
I'm sorry.

00:04:56.868 --> 00:04:57.935
It was you, Naoto?

00:05:02.206 --> 00:05:04.675
No! That's not it…

00:05:05.543 --> 00:05:08.880
It's all because I suggested burying it
in a time capsule back then.

00:05:09.814 --> 00:05:11.149
I've been thinking…

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:14.886
Let's bury a time capsule
after the graduation ceremony.

00:05:16.354 --> 00:05:17.455
Time capsule?

00:05:18.756 --> 00:05:21.859
Once we graduate,
the school will be closed down.

00:05:23.127 --> 00:05:24.962
That means no one will go there anymore,
right?

00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:28.099
Yeah, let's do it.

00:05:29.467 --> 00:05:30.701
I have something

00:05:31.903 --> 00:05:34.305
I want to bury in the time capsule.

00:05:34.972 --> 00:05:38.209
It was my fault for taking the gun
in the first place.

00:05:39.677 --> 00:05:42.513
I had it hidden in the drawer of my desk
at home,

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.282
but I had regretted taking it,

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:47.652
so I felt relieved when I was able
to bury it in the time capsule.

00:05:47.718 --> 00:05:49.187
It’s also my fault too,

00:05:52.123 --> 00:05:53.825
since it was my idea to go to the forest.

00:05:53.891 --> 00:05:57.795
Since the armed bank robber
is still at large,

00:05:57.862 --> 00:06:00.565
all elementary and middle school students
in the city

00:06:00.631 --> 00:06:02.733
will all walk home together in groups.

00:06:03.234 --> 00:06:05.770
- What?
- You've got to be kidding me.

00:06:05.837 --> 00:06:09.140
Even after returning home,
you guys are prohibited from going outside

00:06:09.207 --> 00:06:11.342
unless accompanied
by a parent or guardian.

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:13.578
- What?
- No way!

00:06:15.446 --> 00:06:17.415
- Hey!
- Hey!

00:06:17.482 --> 00:06:19.684
Screw the group system!

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.352
- I knew you'd say that.
- Yeah!

00:06:21.853 --> 00:06:22.787
What should we do?

00:06:22.854 --> 00:06:25.690
- We're going there, of course.
- We are?

00:06:25.756 --> 00:06:26.824
We're going, right Keisuke?

00:06:26.891 --> 00:06:28.025
- Of course.
- Yeah.

00:06:28.092 --> 00:06:29.327
You coming, Maki?

00:06:29.393 --> 00:06:31.996
I guess I have no other choice.
I'll go too!

00:06:32.063 --> 00:06:33.231
All right!

00:06:33.297 --> 00:06:35.666
There's no point
in bringing all that up now.

00:06:37.935 --> 00:06:40.471
What's done is done, and we can't undo it.

00:06:43.307 --> 00:06:44.842
Let me confirm one last thing.

00:06:46.244 --> 00:06:47.812
Tell me your alibi for Saturday night,

00:06:49.313 --> 00:06:51.616
- the night the incident occurred.
- Hey, wait a minute.

00:06:52.116 --> 00:06:53.217
This is like an interrogation.

00:06:53.284 --> 00:06:56.921
I just want to know
who opened the time capsule.

00:06:56.988 --> 00:06:58.155
But that's not all.

00:06:59.657 --> 00:07:02.159
"The person who killed
Naoto's brother is among us."

00:07:03.027 --> 00:07:04.962
"Now's your chance to come forward."

00:07:05.496 --> 00:07:08.199
"Raise your hand, and I’ll arrest you."
That's what you're saying!

00:07:08.266 --> 00:07:10.801
- That's not what I'm saying!
- That's enough!

00:07:13.404 --> 00:07:15.373
Let’s call it a day.

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:20.945
Is that okay, Junichi?

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:30.187
- Okay.
- Let's go.

00:07:30.988 --> 00:07:32.056
Keisuke, can we talk?

00:07:32.123 --> 00:07:33.057
Hey…

00:07:33.124 --> 00:07:34.659
I have no intention of starting a fight.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.239
The police are aware that Makiko is lying.

00:07:49.507 --> 00:07:50.908
Makiko’s lie?

00:07:50.975 --> 00:07:53.911
Isn't it true that the reason
Makiko went to Smile Sakuma on Friday

00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:57.048
was because her son shoplifted?

00:08:01.385 --> 00:08:02.219
Huh?

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.789
There's no way Masaki would shoplift.

00:08:05.823 --> 00:08:07.358
- You really don’t know?
- Yeah.

00:08:08.659 --> 00:08:10.728
I guess Makiko didn’t consult with you.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.868
Was the breakup so bad
she can't consult you?

00:08:18.369 --> 00:08:19.904
Mind your own business.

00:08:19.971 --> 00:08:21.772
The fact that the police
suspect shoplifting,

00:08:21.839 --> 00:08:24.208
means they think Makiko and Sakuma

00:08:24.275 --> 00:08:25.776
had some kind of connection.

00:08:27.345 --> 00:08:28.679
Don't underestimate the police.

00:08:35.987 --> 00:08:37.188
Damn it.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:50.835
It's all right.

00:08:55.873 --> 00:08:56.741
What's all right?

00:08:59.043 --> 00:09:00.878
Well, I don't really know…

00:09:03.414 --> 00:09:05.816
But it'll be all right.

00:09:20.698 --> 00:09:21.599
Fine.

00:09:22.099 --> 00:09:23.401
Give me time. I'll tell the truth.

00:09:23.467 --> 00:09:24.635
Why can't you tell me now?

00:09:24.702 --> 00:09:27.605
I can, but Makiko…

00:09:28.806 --> 00:09:31.442
Something important is at stake
for Makiko.

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.613
I took lightly the things
that were important to Makiko.

00:09:36.113 --> 00:09:37.748
That's why we ended up breaking up.

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:49.160
But I had regular clients at this shop,
and there was also

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:50.895
the matter of Masaki.

00:09:51.896 --> 00:09:56.000
Ever since elementary school,
he set his sights on Hamadai Middle School

00:09:56.067 --> 00:09:58.202
and he’d been attending cram school too.

00:10:01.906 --> 00:10:02.840
Okay, fine.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.777
I'll talk to Makiko tonight and make sure
we talk to the police tomorrow.

00:10:09.146 --> 00:10:10.648
Fine. Let's get back.

00:10:11.716 --> 00:10:13.751
Can I ask you a question too?

00:10:14.652 --> 00:10:15.486
What is it?

00:10:16.287 --> 00:10:17.421
What did you think

00:10:18.289 --> 00:10:21.158
when you found out that Makiko and I
married and then divorced?

00:10:24.095 --> 00:10:25.029
Nothing in particular.

00:10:25.596 --> 00:10:28.332
When we were kids, Makiko liked you.

00:10:29.233 --> 00:10:30.768
That’s ancient history.

00:10:31.635 --> 00:10:36.073
Did you think, "Why did you marry Keisuke?
You used to like me."

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.074
No way.

00:10:37.141 --> 00:10:39.043
Or "You and Keisuke ended up divorcing?"

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:41.445
"You would have been happy
with me forever."

00:10:41.512 --> 00:10:43.447
That would've never crossed my mind.

00:10:43.514 --> 00:10:45.382
Why didn't you contact Makiko?

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:47.718
After you graduated and moved,

00:10:48.719 --> 00:10:50.688
didn't you ever think about
contacting Makiko?

00:10:52.723 --> 00:10:54.391
If I had, I would’ve contacted her.

00:10:55.826 --> 00:10:57.528
You're right.

00:11:00.264 --> 00:11:03.067
You contacted her though, huh?

00:11:03.734 --> 00:11:04.702
No.

00:11:06.237 --> 00:11:08.773
Around the time when I saw you
in Yokohama…

00:11:10.074 --> 00:11:11.542
Keep your hands to yourself.

00:11:11.609 --> 00:11:14.578
Junichi, you were a police officer,
and I was a university student.

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:17.982
Makiko was attending a cosmetology school
in Yokohama

00:11:18.048 --> 00:11:19.350
while working part-time at a cafe.

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.388
Thank you for waiting.

00:11:24.455 --> 00:11:25.656
Thank you.

00:11:26.857 --> 00:11:27.691
Watch out.

00:11:27.758 --> 00:11:30.694
There’s someone staring at you, Iwamoto.

00:11:31.228 --> 00:11:32.129
What?

00:11:33.264 --> 00:11:35.966
Thank you for waiting.
What would you like to order?

00:11:36.467 --> 00:11:38.736
You’re Makiko Iwamoto, right?

00:11:39.336 --> 00:11:40.171
What?

00:11:42.006 --> 00:11:42.840
What?

00:11:43.641 --> 00:11:45.009
Keisuke?

00:11:45.509 --> 00:11:46.443
Yeah.

00:11:47.077 --> 00:11:48.412
No way!

00:11:49.513 --> 00:11:51.615
I met her by chance, so I talked to her.

00:11:51.682 --> 00:11:53.951
I see.

00:11:54.752 --> 00:11:57.321
I ran into both you and Makiko.

00:11:58.522 --> 00:12:01.392
I didn’t tell Makiko that I had seen you.

00:12:02.493 --> 00:12:05.462
I didn’t want you to take Makiko
away from me.

00:12:09.867 --> 00:12:11.235
I wouldn’t take her away.

00:12:11.302 --> 00:12:13.904
Even if you didn’t,
she would’ve gone to you.

00:12:15.739 --> 00:12:17.041
I guess so.

00:12:17.107 --> 00:12:18.542
Hey!

00:12:20.611 --> 00:12:22.112
You’ve always been like that.

00:12:23.647 --> 00:12:24.648
Let's go back.

00:12:43.467 --> 00:12:44.535
He's sleeping.

00:12:45.603 --> 00:12:48.439
It seems the police already know about
Masaki's shoplifting.

00:12:50.374 --> 00:12:51.842
We have to tell the police about it.

00:12:52.409 --> 00:12:54.345
Wait a minute,
what's going to happen to Masaki?

00:12:55.679 --> 00:12:57.882
The police might contact the school,

00:12:57.948 --> 00:13:00.117
and his acceptance could be revoked.

00:13:00.184 --> 00:13:02.753
It would also cause trouble for the school
that recommended him.

00:13:04.889 --> 00:13:06.891
We can have Junichi help us with that.

00:13:06.957 --> 00:13:09.526
- Will he be able to help us?
- I’ll ask him to help us out.

00:13:09.593 --> 00:13:12.096
- What if he can’t do anything about it?
- Just calm down.

00:13:13.631 --> 00:13:17.201
I thought you understood and supported me.

00:13:17.701 --> 00:13:19.403
Someone died!

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.572
There's no way we can just
keep quiet like this.

00:13:22.072 --> 00:13:24.041
If we keep lying, we'll become suspects.

00:13:24.108 --> 00:13:25.643
It's better to tell them beforehand.

00:13:27.077 --> 00:13:29.580
Of course, we won’t tell them everything.

00:13:32.082 --> 00:13:33.651
Let’s decide how much to disclose.

00:13:35.619 --> 00:13:36.754
Let's also discuss

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.556
what to say when we’re asked about
our alibi for Saturday.

00:13:44.161 --> 00:13:45.296
Okay.

00:13:55.039 --> 00:13:56.907
Why didn't you contact Makiko?

00:14:08.152 --> 00:14:09.320
Good morning.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.488
Good morning.

00:14:12.623 --> 00:14:13.757
You're here early.

00:14:13.824 --> 00:14:15.292
You too, Chief Kosugi.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.129
I hope Tobina
isn't causing you any trouble.

00:14:19.697 --> 00:14:20.631
Trouble?

00:14:21.131 --> 00:14:25.002
I hope he hasn’t been rude
or inconvenienced you in any way.

00:14:25.069 --> 00:14:26.303
I'm not one to talk.

00:14:27.938 --> 00:14:32.042
I hear that you're a standout figure
at headquarters, Ms. Nara.

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:35.379
I hear that people are saying
I’m difficult to deal with.

00:14:35.879 --> 00:14:39.249
The police force is still very much
a male-dominated, hierarchical society.

00:14:42.119 --> 00:14:44.989
I imagine things are quite difficult
with all the different factions.

00:14:45.489 --> 00:14:46.457
Factions?

00:14:47.424 --> 00:14:49.560
I guess you’re not concerned with it.

00:14:51.261 --> 00:14:53.230
Since I'm already
in a faction-based workforce,

00:14:53.297 --> 00:14:55.766
I think I'll try flattering someone
for once.

00:14:56.533 --> 00:14:57.568
Thanks.

00:15:02.272 --> 00:15:03.607
Drink up.

00:15:17.921 --> 00:15:20.124
Sorry for taking up your time
this morning.

00:15:20.824 --> 00:15:22.026
I don’t mind.

00:15:22.526 --> 00:15:23.894
I'm glad you called.

00:15:24.395 --> 00:15:26.296
I had decided to go jogging every morning,

00:15:26.363 --> 00:15:30.334
but I gave up after three days, and I was
feeling disappointed with myself.

00:15:32.302 --> 00:15:34.204
Wow, even you have days like that, huh?

00:15:34.838 --> 00:15:37.241
What about you?
What's up with you this morning?

00:15:37.741 --> 00:15:38.575
What do you mean?

00:15:38.642 --> 00:15:39.543
Well…

00:15:40.077 --> 00:15:42.646
Could it be that you were swayed
by a woman you used to like,

00:15:42.713 --> 00:15:43.680
perhaps at a class reunion?

00:15:43.747 --> 00:15:44.681
Huh?

00:15:45.649 --> 00:15:47.584
- What?
- You had a class reunion yesterday, right?

00:15:47.651 --> 00:15:49.153
Ms. Nara had mentioned it.

00:15:51.321 --> 00:15:54.224
How was the reunion last night?

00:15:54.291 --> 00:15:55.759
Oh, it was a wake, huh?

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.828
It was like a class reunion.

00:15:59.963 --> 00:16:02.566
Did you guys have fun
reminiscing about the past?

00:16:02.633 --> 00:16:04.668
Yes. We had a lot of fun.

00:16:04.735 --> 00:16:06.203
I see.

00:16:07.071 --> 00:16:10.107
So? Did you glean any intel from it?

00:16:10.607 --> 00:16:14.812
Ms. Makiko Iwamoto says she wants to talk
about her visit to Smile Sakuma on Friday.

00:16:14.878 --> 00:16:16.046
Detective Tobina,

00:16:16.113 --> 00:16:17.948
you were able to persuade her?

00:16:18.015 --> 00:16:19.416
No, I didn’t do anything.

00:16:19.483 --> 00:16:21.218
She said she wanted to talk to us.

00:16:21.885 --> 00:16:24.521
Her ex-husband, Mr. Keisuke Kiyohara,
will be coming too.

00:16:24.588 --> 00:16:27.558
Finally, all the players will be present.

00:16:49.913 --> 00:16:51.315
Your jacket button?

00:16:52.015 --> 00:16:52.983
It's missing.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:55.419
It’s the jacket I was wearing
when I met Sakuma.

00:16:55.919 --> 00:16:58.188
You’re sure you were wearing it that day?

00:16:58.922 --> 00:16:59.890
Yeah.

00:17:00.624 --> 00:17:02.526
I wonder if I dropped it there…

00:17:04.094 --> 00:17:05.295
The police suspect

00:17:05.362 --> 00:17:07.898
that you and Sakuma
had some kind of connection.

00:17:08.465 --> 00:17:11.702
If a button was found at the crime scene,
they would have questioned you about it.

00:17:12.903 --> 00:17:14.705
Maybe they’ll find it later.

00:17:15.205 --> 00:17:18.709
Maybe they found it already
and we’ll be asked about it today.

00:17:18.775 --> 00:17:19.743
Yeah…

00:17:21.411 --> 00:17:24.047
If they ask, you should acknowledge
that it's your button.

00:17:24.882 --> 00:17:26.016
Since we're going to tell them

00:17:26.083 --> 00:17:28.485
that we went to that office
to cut that initial deal with Sakuma.

00:17:29.186 --> 00:17:30.087
Okay.

00:17:31.188 --> 00:17:32.389
Without further ado,

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:36.426
please tell us about what happened
at Smile Sakuma on Friday.

00:17:37.861 --> 00:17:39.263
I’m sorry,

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:41.832
I lied about something.

00:17:43.333 --> 00:17:45.235
I went to the supermarket on Friday

00:17:45.869 --> 00:17:47.204
because I received a call

00:17:48.038 --> 00:17:50.707
from Mr. Sakuma saying that my son
had shoplifted.

00:17:51.341 --> 00:17:54.478
My son was accepted into middle school
through a recommendation process,

00:17:55.812 --> 00:17:58.749
and I didn't want his admission
to be revoked.

00:18:02.286 --> 00:18:03.453
Mr. Sakuma told me

00:18:04.588 --> 00:18:07.925
he would not contact
the police or the school,

00:18:08.792 --> 00:18:10.727
if I proved how sincerely sorry I was.

00:18:12.696 --> 00:18:15.299
So I agreed to pay him 300,000 yen.

00:18:15.365 --> 00:18:16.867
And then?

00:18:22.406 --> 00:18:26.276
She contacted me,

00:18:27.077 --> 00:18:28.912
and the two of us went
to hand him the money.

00:18:30.147 --> 00:18:33.116
What time was that?

00:18:33.183 --> 00:18:34.651
It was eleven o'clock at night.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:39.323
Agreeing to that deal
might have been reckless.

00:18:39.823 --> 00:18:42.826
But it was in my son’s best interests,

00:18:42.893 --> 00:18:44.595
so I don't regret the decision.

00:18:46.997 --> 00:18:48.865
The agreement was that

00:18:49.366 --> 00:18:50.734
in exchange for 300,000 yen,

00:18:50.801 --> 00:18:54.504
he wouldn't report your son's shoplifting
to the police or the school.

00:18:55.706 --> 00:18:58.242
But what happened to the video footage?

00:19:00.644 --> 00:19:02.646
The security camera footage?

00:19:02.713 --> 00:19:03.780
Yes.

00:19:05.215 --> 00:19:08.552
I was supposed to receive that
in exchange for 300,000 yen,

00:19:09.052 --> 00:19:11.088
but I was so nervous
during the transaction

00:19:11.154 --> 00:19:12.623
that I forgot to get it from him.

00:19:13.657 --> 00:19:15.659
I was planning to contact him again,

00:19:15.726 --> 00:19:18.495
but then that whole incident happened.

00:19:20.631 --> 00:19:23.166
I see.

00:19:25.168 --> 00:19:26.103
Yes.

00:19:34.177 --> 00:19:35.045
The thing is…

00:19:38.582 --> 00:19:40.817
the data from the day of the shoplifting

00:19:42.185 --> 00:19:44.421
hasn't been found yet.

00:19:45.022 --> 00:19:46.123
Is that right?

00:19:47.724 --> 00:19:49.259
I wonder what happened to it?

00:19:52.763 --> 00:19:54.698
Did Mr. Sakuma dispose of it?

00:19:55.299 --> 00:19:56.600
Do you think he did?

00:19:56.667 --> 00:19:59.636
That Mr. Sakuma, who extorted
300,000 yen because a child shoplifted?

00:19:59.703 --> 00:20:00.704
I don't think so.

00:20:01.505 --> 00:20:04.374
That day, we gave him 300,000 yen,
and that was the end of it,

00:20:05.375 --> 00:20:09.246
but honestly, I was still worried
that he might keep demanding more.

00:20:09.313 --> 00:20:13.950
Mr. Sakuma might have hidden it
somewhere safe.

00:20:18.689 --> 00:20:21.158
Now we’ve told you all we know.

00:20:21.892 --> 00:20:25.595
But is there anything else
you’d like to know?

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:28.832
Let's see…

00:20:31.635 --> 00:20:34.037
Detective Tobina, was there anything else?

00:20:35.672 --> 00:20:37.507
- No.
- Then that's it.

00:20:39.142 --> 00:20:40.911
{\an8}Thank you for coming today.

00:20:40.977 --> 00:20:42.412
{\an8}- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.681
{\an8}I'll walk you guys out.

00:20:46.483 --> 00:20:49.353
{\an8}One more thing…

00:20:50.554 --> 00:20:52.422
{\an8}About my son's shoplifting…

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:56.093
will it be reported to the school?

00:20:56.159 --> 00:20:58.795
We will report this as a fact
to the investigation headquarters.

00:20:58.862 --> 00:21:00.664
As for reporting this to the school,

00:21:00.731 --> 00:21:03.400
we will leave it to the discretion
of Detective Tobina of the local police.

00:21:11.908 --> 00:21:12.876
I'll see you out.

00:21:15.679 --> 00:21:16.813
Thank you.

00:21:22.419 --> 00:21:23.954
I'm glad we got that over with.

00:21:25.989 --> 00:21:28.425
They didn't say anything
about the jacket button,

00:21:29.192 --> 00:21:32.529
and they didn't ask us
about our alibi for Saturday either.

00:21:46.443 --> 00:21:48.812
Thank you for being understanding
about the shoplifting incident.

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.882
By the way,

00:21:54.017 --> 00:21:56.253
I assume
that Mr. Keisuke Kiyohara's father

00:21:56.953 --> 00:21:58.922
is indeed Police Officer Kazuo Kiyohara,

00:21:58.989 --> 00:22:02.492
who was killed in the line of duty
23 years ago, right?

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:04.661
That's correct.

00:22:06.196 --> 00:22:09.032
I learned about it when I read
the files from 23 years ago.

00:22:11.067 --> 00:22:11.968
I'm sorry.

00:22:12.469 --> 00:22:14.771
I should have informed you about it
in advance.

00:22:14.838 --> 00:22:16.239
I agree.

00:22:24.714 --> 00:22:25.549
I'm sure you know--

00:22:25.615 --> 00:22:27.350
The victim's younger brother,

00:22:27.417 --> 00:22:29.252
Mr. Naoto Sakuma,

00:22:30.454 --> 00:22:32.789
Mr. Keisuke Kiyohara,

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:35.725
Ms. Makiko Iwamoto,

00:22:37.227 --> 00:22:38.962
and you, Detective Tobina.

00:22:41.398 --> 00:22:42.566
The four of you

00:22:43.366 --> 00:22:48.104
were the first people
to discover the body of Officer Kiyohara.

00:22:49.906 --> 00:22:51.641
Is that correct?

00:22:54.811 --> 00:22:55.645
Yes.

00:22:58.715 --> 00:23:00.116
That's correct.

00:23:06.723 --> 00:23:08.892
This is very interesting.

00:23:10.961 --> 00:23:14.130
The four people involved
in the incident 23 years ago

00:23:15.265 --> 00:23:18.468
are reunited because Sakuma was murdered.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.307
Detective Tobina.

00:23:26.042 --> 00:23:26.943
Yes?

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:28.745
I want the four of you to gather together

00:23:28.812 --> 00:23:30.680
so that I can confirm something.

00:23:34.784 --> 00:23:35.685
Okay.

00:23:45.295 --> 00:23:47.964
Junichi? What's up?

00:23:48.031 --> 00:23:49.132
Sorry to bother you at work.

00:23:49.199 --> 00:23:50.400
It's all right.

00:23:50.467 --> 00:23:51.768
Do you have time right now?

00:23:51.835 --> 00:23:53.970
I have a client waiting for me.

00:23:54.037 --> 00:23:55.138
Oh, I see.

00:23:56.106 --> 00:23:57.140
Then can we talk later?

00:23:58.008 --> 00:23:59.543
Sure.

00:24:04.848 --> 00:24:06.516
- Welcome back.
- Hi.

00:24:06.583 --> 00:24:07.517
This is my son, Masaki.

00:24:08.552 --> 00:24:09.653
Oh.

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:12.455
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:24:12.522 --> 00:24:14.758
This is…

00:24:14.824 --> 00:24:16.059
I'm Junichi.

00:24:18.461 --> 00:24:20.797
You like playing baseball?

00:24:20.864 --> 00:24:21.865
Yes.

00:24:22.399 --> 00:24:23.500
Want to play catch?

00:24:24.301 --> 00:24:25.235
- What?
- Let's do it.

00:24:25.302 --> 00:24:27.203
- Really?
- Let's do it.

00:24:32.576 --> 00:24:33.677
Nice catch.

00:24:34.678 --> 00:24:36.680
Very nice.

00:24:38.415 --> 00:24:39.449
Good job.

00:24:50.894 --> 00:24:53.029
All right, good job.

00:24:53.096 --> 00:24:54.230
Good one.

00:24:55.398 --> 00:24:56.499
Give it all you've got.

00:24:57.167 --> 00:24:58.234
- Come.
- Okay.

00:25:01.237 --> 00:25:02.973
- Whoa!
- Sorry!

00:25:03.039 --> 00:25:04.107
Hold on.

00:25:04.674 --> 00:25:06.643
You must be naturally athletic.

00:25:07.877 --> 00:25:10.280
You're Keisuke and Makiko's child
after all.

00:25:11.648 --> 00:25:12.816
Your parents

00:25:14.017 --> 00:25:16.586
were both really good at sports.
Did you know?

00:25:16.653 --> 00:25:19.556
- I heard that they used to do kendo.
- That's right.

00:25:20.056 --> 00:25:21.891
- I used to do it with them.
- Oh, wow.

00:25:22.592 --> 00:25:23.893
Keisuke's father,

00:25:24.394 --> 00:25:26.563
your grandfather,
is the one who taught us.

00:25:28.331 --> 00:25:30.333
- He taught us how to play ball too.
- Wow.

00:25:32.035 --> 00:25:33.036
I

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:36.740
lost my father when I was little,

00:25:37.741 --> 00:25:39.376
so I was very attached to him.

00:25:40.744 --> 00:25:43.647
Keisuke's dad was a police officer.

00:25:45.482 --> 00:25:47.851
And what do you do?

00:25:48.418 --> 00:25:49.219
I'm a detective.

00:25:50.654 --> 00:25:51.521
What is it?

00:25:51.588 --> 00:25:52.555
What is it?

00:25:52.622 --> 00:25:55.859
You're not a very good liar.

00:25:57.827 --> 00:26:00.964
Hey, I'm not kidding.

00:26:01.531 --> 00:26:02.298
Look.

00:26:02.365 --> 00:26:02.966
JUNICHI TOBINA

00:26:03.033 --> 00:26:05.435
- You're serious?
- I'm serious. I'm a detective.

00:26:05.502 --> 00:26:07.504
- Wow.
- A real detective.

00:26:12.809 --> 00:26:13.977
What is it?

00:26:17.347 --> 00:26:19.783
Am I going to get arrested?

00:26:29.626 --> 00:26:31.161
Well, shoplifting is a crime, huh?

00:26:35.899 --> 00:26:37.500
We won't arrest you this time.

00:26:38.501 --> 00:26:41.871
I promised my mom and dad
that I'll never do it again.

00:26:43.907 --> 00:26:44.874
Good.

00:26:46.342 --> 00:26:47.177
Understood.

00:26:50.513 --> 00:26:53.183
- Is Makiko scary when she gets mad?
- What?

00:26:54.718 --> 00:26:55.585
Thank you.

00:26:55.652 --> 00:26:57.554
- Thank you.
- Please come again.

00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:59.322
- See you again.
- Bye.

00:27:09.365 --> 00:27:12.302
{\an8}Makiko has been tough ever since
she was in elementary school.

00:27:13.536 --> 00:27:15.705
- We have a friend named Naoto--
- I know him.

00:27:15.772 --> 00:27:16.840
You know him?

00:27:16.906 --> 00:27:19.476
Naoto used to get bullied.

00:27:19.542 --> 00:27:21.644
When that happened, Makiko would get angry

00:27:21.711 --> 00:27:22.946
and make us get revenge.

00:27:23.012 --> 00:27:24.347
- You did it?
- Yeah.

00:27:24.414 --> 00:27:27.350
Because we're too scared
to stand up to her.

00:27:27.417 --> 00:27:28.752
- Since she's so tough.
- Hey!

00:27:28.818 --> 00:27:29.753
- Oh crap.
- Hey.

00:27:29.819 --> 00:27:31.387
- Run!
- Hey, stop right there.

00:27:32.122 --> 00:27:34.357
- I'm scared.
- Who are you calling tough?

00:27:34.991 --> 00:27:35.892
I'm scared.

00:27:35.959 --> 00:27:38.962
- Stop telling him unnecessary things.
- Watch out.

00:27:39.028 --> 00:27:40.830
Watch out for her.

00:27:42.966 --> 00:27:43.867
So?

00:27:44.434 --> 00:27:46.202
What did you want to talk about?

00:27:52.242 --> 00:27:54.644
I want you to come
to Mitsuba Police Station again.

00:27:55.612 --> 00:27:56.446
What?

00:27:58.281 --> 00:28:00.884
Detective Nara realized
that the four of us were the first

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:03.987
to discover Keisuke's father's body,
and she wants to talk to us.

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:11.594
Okay.

00:28:12.095 --> 00:28:13.463
I'm sure it goes without saying,

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:17.700
but please pretend you don't know about
the details of the investigation I leaked.

00:28:19.068 --> 00:28:20.503
Specifically, the fact that the weapon

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:24.174
used in the Sakuma murder
was the gun we buried 23 years ago.

00:28:29.145 --> 00:28:30.413
Okay.

00:28:30.914 --> 00:28:32.382
But first,

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:35.919
there's something I want to ask you.

00:28:36.419 --> 00:28:37.720
What is it?

00:28:38.855 --> 00:28:40.523
I want to confirm one more time.

00:28:42.826 --> 00:28:43.893
Makiko…

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:49.365
You didn't open the time capsule, right?

00:28:55.271 --> 00:28:56.406
{\an8}Makiko…

00:28:59.943 --> 00:29:01.778
You didn't open the time capsule, right?

00:29:04.347 --> 00:29:06.716
Junichi, do you suspect me?

00:29:07.217 --> 00:29:09.252
Given the circumstances,
I have no choice but to ask.

00:29:10.653 --> 00:29:12.555
Given the circumstances,

00:29:12.622 --> 00:29:14.591
you really think
I could dig that up on my own?

00:29:20.864 --> 00:29:21.831
Yeah.

00:29:23.099 --> 00:29:24.534
Are you serious?

00:29:24.601 --> 00:29:27.503
Junichi, even you had to have
another person to help dig that up.

00:29:31.908 --> 00:29:33.176
I guess you couldn't do it alone.

00:29:39.449 --> 00:29:41.985
You're saying that I have an accomplice?

00:29:46.923 --> 00:29:48.858
Do you think I'd take

00:29:49.359 --> 00:29:51.895
such a risk with someone?

00:29:57.767 --> 00:29:59.903
I've had enough of that already.

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:02.438
That day,

00:30:03.706 --> 00:30:06.142
we all learned our lesson, didn't we?

00:30:08.211 --> 00:30:11.047
We were told not to leave the house
because a bank robber

00:30:11.114 --> 00:30:12.382
was on the loose,

00:30:13.383 --> 00:30:15.351
but you said you were going to the forest.

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:20.323
I went with all of you guys
because you're the one who suggested it.

00:30:23.359 --> 00:30:24.360
What do you mean?

00:30:24.427 --> 00:30:27.130
If Keisuke or Naoto
had suggested going to the forest,

00:30:27.196 --> 00:30:29.299
I would've just said, "Are you crazy?"
and went home.

00:30:30.533 --> 00:30:31.401
Why?

00:30:35.538 --> 00:30:37.140
I don't know why.

00:30:45.348 --> 00:30:48.985
Anyway, I won't take any more risks.

00:30:52.522 --> 00:30:54.891
- Me too.
- Because you're a detective?

00:31:01.731 --> 00:31:02.632
Liar.

00:31:03.333 --> 00:31:06.936
You're a detective, but leaked
info about the investigation to us.

00:31:13.009 --> 00:31:14.377
You're right.

00:31:15.545 --> 00:31:18.114
What situation have we gotten
ourselves into?

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:26.522
Right when we finally got to reunite

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:29.325
after 23 years…

00:31:37.533 --> 00:31:38.601
I

00:31:40.169 --> 00:31:42.305
didn't open the time capsule.

00:31:48.978 --> 00:31:50.113
I understand.

00:31:54.784 --> 00:31:55.785
I believe you.

00:32:04.494 --> 00:32:05.928
Good evening.

00:32:05.995 --> 00:32:07.764
Good evening to you too.

00:32:08.698 --> 00:32:11.300
Excuse me, I'm from
the Mitsuba Police Station.

00:32:11.367 --> 00:32:14.103
We're asking people if they saw
anyone suspicious around here.

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:16.305
It's regarding January 17th.

00:32:16.372 --> 00:32:17.407
January 17th?

00:32:17.473 --> 00:32:20.309
Were you walking your dog
at this time on that day?

00:32:20.376 --> 00:32:21.978
I don't remember.

00:32:22.045 --> 00:32:23.146
- I see.
- Sorry.

00:32:51.841 --> 00:32:52.675
MITSUBA POLICE STATION

00:32:52.742 --> 00:32:55.812
Thank you for coming here
time and time again.

00:32:56.679 --> 00:32:59.549
We haven't yet heard your alibis
for Saturday night,

00:32:59.615 --> 00:33:01.117
which is the night

00:33:01.184 --> 00:33:02.919
Hideyuki Sakuma was murdered.

00:33:02.985 --> 00:33:04.921
So we will question you two individually.

00:33:06.589 --> 00:33:09.425
After that,
when Mr. Naoto Sakuma joins us,

00:33:09.492 --> 00:33:11.427
we will ask all of you some questions.

00:33:12.528 --> 00:33:13.362
Okay.

00:33:13.863 --> 00:33:17.600
Makiko and I meet once every two months.

00:33:17.667 --> 00:33:20.770
The main purpose is to talk about our son.

00:33:20.837 --> 00:33:23.139
That Saturday was the day
we were supposed to meet,

00:33:23.206 --> 00:33:25.341
and given our son's shoplifting incident,

00:33:25.408 --> 00:33:26.742
we discussed what to do.

00:33:26.809 --> 00:33:28.945
We left our son with my parents

00:33:29.445 --> 00:33:33.216
and talked together at a restaurant
near the train station at 8:00 p.m.

00:33:33.282 --> 00:33:36.486
After that, I went to the hotel

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.054
and checked in.

00:33:38.121 --> 00:33:40.823
I went back to the hair salon.

00:33:41.557 --> 00:33:45.695
But I still wanted to discuss
my son a little more,

00:33:46.829 --> 00:33:50.133
so we arranged to meet again
at a restaurant.

00:33:50.833 --> 00:33:52.835
What time was that?

00:33:53.736 --> 00:33:56.139
- I think it was around 10:30.
- I think it was around 10:30.

00:33:57.673 --> 00:34:01.010
Then we went to her house,
and drank together.

00:34:01.577 --> 00:34:03.279
Since it was a hassle
to go back to the hotel,

00:34:03.346 --> 00:34:05.815
I just stayed there until morning.

00:34:07.049 --> 00:34:08.150
I remained there.

00:34:08.217 --> 00:34:09.185
Ms. Iwamoto,

00:34:09.252 --> 00:34:13.122
you were at the hair salon until
a little before 10:30, is that right?

00:34:13.189 --> 00:34:14.190
Yes.

00:34:14.257 --> 00:34:16.526
Was anyone else there with you?

00:34:16.592 --> 00:34:18.694
No, I was alone.

00:34:26.569 --> 00:34:29.639
Is it because they used to be married?

00:34:31.741 --> 00:34:34.777
It's very interesting
how perfectly their alibis

00:34:36.245 --> 00:34:37.547
line up with each other.

00:34:47.056 --> 00:34:48.157
Now,

00:34:48.724 --> 00:34:52.728
what I'm about to tell you
must be kept strictly confidential.

00:34:52.795 --> 00:34:53.696
Yes, ma'am.

00:34:55.631 --> 00:34:57.300
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:34:59.268 --> 00:35:01.404
It turns out

00:35:02.238 --> 00:35:05.308
that the weapon used in the murder
of Hideyuki Sakuma

00:35:06.008 --> 00:35:08.578
is the gun that belonged
to Officer Kazuo Kiyohara,

00:35:08.644 --> 00:35:11.247
which went missing 23 years ago.

00:35:11.981 --> 00:35:13.182
- What?
- Ms. Nara.

00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:15.484
Is this allowed?

00:35:15.551 --> 00:35:17.820
This is confidential information
about the investigation.

00:35:19.956 --> 00:35:21.724
You must be shocked by this news.

00:35:21.791 --> 00:35:22.792
Yes.

00:35:26.896 --> 00:35:28.264
Are you sure about that?

00:35:28.331 --> 00:35:29.165
Yes.

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:33.069
Bullets fired from a handgun

00:35:33.135 --> 00:35:35.037
have what are called rifling marks.

00:35:36.138 --> 00:35:37.907
Rifling… marks?

00:35:38.541 --> 00:35:39.875
I've never heard of that before.

00:35:41.277 --> 00:35:43.746
- Really?
- Yes.

00:35:46.649 --> 00:35:48.417
The person who killed Mr. Sakuma

00:35:48.484 --> 00:35:51.687
was in possession of the gun that belonged
to Mr. Kiyohara's father.

00:35:52.622 --> 00:35:54.557
Whether the culprit had the gun
for many years,

00:35:54.624 --> 00:35:57.827
or acquired it recently is unclear.

00:35:58.327 --> 00:35:59.795
But the source of the gun

00:35:59.862 --> 00:36:02.465
is likely a key to solving the case.

00:36:03.966 --> 00:36:07.870
So, that means the person who killed
Mr. Sakuma is someone connected

00:36:09.205 --> 00:36:11.407
to the incident from 23 years ago?

00:36:12.074 --> 00:36:13.709
I cannot say for sure.

00:36:14.944 --> 00:36:19.515
But it is true that
there is some connection

00:36:20.016 --> 00:36:23.653
between this incident
and the incident from 23 years ago.

00:36:25.721 --> 00:36:26.756
Therefore,

00:36:27.923 --> 00:36:29.659
I have a question for all of you

00:36:29.725 --> 00:36:32.762
who were the first to discover
Officer Kiyohara's body.

00:36:36.599 --> 00:36:39.168
While playing in the forest,

00:36:40.036 --> 00:36:42.538
all of you heard gunshots.

00:36:44.206 --> 00:36:46.075
While fleeing the forest,

00:36:46.642 --> 00:36:49.845
you discovered the body
of Officer Kiyohara

00:36:50.346 --> 00:36:53.949
and immediately left the forest
to report it to the police.

00:36:57.186 --> 00:36:59.822
That's what the investigation file states.

00:37:02.858 --> 00:37:05.061
Are there any discrepancies?

00:37:08.431 --> 00:37:09.765
It was a long time ago,

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:12.902
so my memory is a bit hazy,

00:37:13.602 --> 00:37:15.304
but I think it's mostly accurate.

00:37:19.442 --> 00:37:21.844
What about you, Mr. Kiyohara?

00:37:26.415 --> 00:37:29.852
I was in shock after discovering
my father's body,

00:37:29.919 --> 00:37:31.387
and I was very upset.

00:37:32.955 --> 00:37:35.191
I don't remember the details very well,

00:37:35.257 --> 00:37:36.625
but yes, I think

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:39.128
that statement is generally accurate.

00:37:40.629 --> 00:37:44.633
When the police discovered
Officer Kiyohara's body,

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:46.902
his gun was already missing

00:37:46.969 --> 00:37:48.904
from his holster.

00:37:50.673 --> 00:37:53.976
Did any of you witness anything
at the scene?

00:37:55.311 --> 00:37:57.580
For example, a suspicious person

00:37:57.646 --> 00:37:59.782
or any unusual sounds would be helpful.

00:38:00.549 --> 00:38:02.985
Ms. Iwamoto, do you remember anything?

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:07.623
I don't remember much of what happened.

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:09.291
I was in a panic.

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:13.763
- I'm sorry.
- Mr. Sakuma, how about you?

00:38:14.864 --> 00:38:17.099
I don't remember much either,

00:38:17.166 --> 00:38:20.803
but there was a man lying on the ground
a short distance away

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:23.172
from Keisuke's father.

00:38:23.873 --> 00:38:26.108
That must've been the culprit
Nobukazu Oshima.

00:38:26.842 --> 00:38:27.676
Yes.

00:38:28.244 --> 00:38:31.280
He robbed 30 million yen
from an armored cash transport vehicle

00:38:31.347 --> 00:38:34.450
of a bank in Mitsuba City
and fired his gun.

00:38:35.618 --> 00:38:40.589
That bullet
killed a male resident of that city.

00:38:43.959 --> 00:38:47.129
It was always believed
that he had an accomplice,

00:38:48.364 --> 00:38:51.801
and when we discovered
Officer Kiyohara's body,

00:38:53.068 --> 00:38:54.804
the gun was missing.

00:38:56.772 --> 00:38:58.407
It's presumed that the accomplice took it.

00:38:58.908 --> 00:39:00.242
That's what Chief said.

00:39:02.144 --> 00:39:02.978
There's

00:39:04.747 --> 00:39:07.316
something that bothers me
about that speculation.

00:39:23.632 --> 00:39:24.800
But never mind.

00:39:29.805 --> 00:39:30.706
That's it?

00:39:30.773 --> 00:39:31.740
For today.

00:39:34.977 --> 00:39:38.481
In any case, the murder of Mr. Sakuma

00:39:38.547 --> 00:39:41.917
is undoubtedly connected to the incident
that occurred 23 years ago.

00:39:43.953 --> 00:39:45.254
See you again…

00:39:46.255 --> 00:39:47.089
Mr. Keisuke Kiyohara.

00:39:49.825 --> 00:39:51.193
Mr. Naoto Sakuma.

00:39:52.328 --> 00:39:53.762
Ms. Makiko Iwamoto.

00:39:57.032 --> 00:39:58.167
Mr. Junichi Tobina.

00:40:01.437 --> 00:40:03.005
See them out.

00:40:03.839 --> 00:40:04.673
Yes.

00:40:13.682 --> 00:40:14.717
Junichi,

00:40:16.085 --> 00:40:17.119
I

00:40:18.787 --> 00:40:20.789
didn't open the time capsule.

00:40:23.225 --> 00:40:24.426
Junichi.

00:40:28.864 --> 00:40:29.698
Hm?

00:40:30.499 --> 00:40:32.134
Are you leaving already?

00:40:34.003 --> 00:40:34.937
Yeah.

00:40:35.437 --> 00:40:36.472
I see.

00:40:39.174 --> 00:40:40.409
Sorry, did I wake you?

00:40:40.476 --> 00:40:42.611
No, it's time for me to wake up.

00:40:42.678 --> 00:40:43.646
Okay.

00:40:43.712 --> 00:40:44.647
Yeah.

00:40:46.215 --> 00:40:47.983
Hey Junichi,

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:51.186
once your work settles down,
I want to go on a date.

00:40:51.253 --> 00:40:52.588
A date?

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:57.826
- Yeah, I'll think of places to go.
- Yeah.

00:40:58.327 --> 00:40:59.361
Okay.

00:40:59.428 --> 00:41:00.329
Okay.

00:41:01.297 --> 00:41:02.398
I gotta go.

00:41:02.898 --> 00:41:04.934
- Someone suspicious?
- Yes.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.036
Reports of sexual harassment
are increasing in this area.

00:41:07.536 --> 00:41:09.138
I haven't seen anything.

00:41:09.638 --> 00:41:10.472
I see.

00:41:10.539 --> 00:41:11.740
Thank you for your time.

00:41:12.241 --> 00:41:14.877
- Thank you.
- It's a great day for a walk, huh?

00:41:15.978 --> 00:41:18.647
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

00:41:18.714 --> 00:41:20.115
What a big dog.

00:41:20.616 --> 00:41:23.586
- High-five. Wow.
- Good boy.

00:41:24.086 --> 00:41:26.455
- It's a well-trained dog.
- Thank you.

00:41:26.522 --> 00:41:28.457
He says you are well-trained.

00:41:29.024 --> 00:41:30.326
Recent ongoing?

00:41:30.392 --> 00:41:31.260
OPPOSE THE CONSTRUCTION
OF THE SHOPPING MALL!

00:41:31.327 --> 00:41:33.495
I think I remember seeing someone
walking around

00:41:33.562 --> 00:41:35.698
inside the school grounds
during my evening walk.

00:41:36.699 --> 00:41:37.733
When was that?

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:38.968
That was the day

00:41:39.034 --> 00:41:41.804
when I ended up taking a late walk,
so it was Friday.

00:41:43.806 --> 00:41:45.074
Was it a male or a female?

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:46.041
It was a man.

00:41:46.542 --> 00:41:47.876
Can you describe him?

00:41:47.943 --> 00:41:50.312
I couldn't see since it was too dark.

00:41:50.813 --> 00:41:53.282
But I can identify the parked car.

00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:55.784
It was a black SUV
with a Shinagawa license plate.

00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:00.589
SHINAGAWA

00:42:04.026 --> 00:42:06.662
Is it because they used to be married?

00:42:07.162 --> 00:42:09.865
It's very interesting how perfectly
their alibis line up with each other.

00:42:24.913 --> 00:42:26.015
‪I'l do it.

00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:28.183
No,

00:42:28.851 --> 00:42:30.319
- I'll do it.
- No.

00:42:30.819 --> 00:42:31.987
Think of Masaki.

00:42:32.488 --> 00:42:35.357
Plus, he might use his strength
against you.

00:42:36.191 --> 00:42:38.527
- Can you really do it, Keisuke?
- Yeah, I can do it.

00:43:19.802 --> 00:43:20.669
{\an8}Wow!

00:43:21.236 --> 00:43:22.671
{\an8}So cool!

00:43:23.872 --> 00:43:25.340
{\an8}- Tobina.
- Yes?

00:43:26.508 --> 00:43:29.244
{\an8}You better not get too cocky.

00:43:30.612 --> 00:43:31.547
{\an8}I'm sorry.

00:43:32.114 --> 00:43:33.215
{\an8}All right, let's go.

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:36.118
{\an8}Excuse me.

00:43:36.185 --> 00:43:37.486
{\an8}Enjoy.

00:43:56.438 --> 00:43:59.775
{\an8}You're saying that I have an accomplice?

00:44:13.055 --> 00:44:13.589
PREVIEW OF THE NEXT EPISODE

00:44:13.655 --> 00:44:15.157
She's Mr. Junichi's girlfriend.

00:44:15.224 --> 00:44:15.924
{\an8}Are you guys going to get married?

00:44:15.991 --> 00:44:16.825
{\an8}EACH INDIVIDUAL'S WAVERING FEELINGS

00:44:16.892 --> 00:44:19.294
{\an8}Whatever it was that
I desperately wanted to win,

00:44:19.361 --> 00:44:20.796
{\an8}he won it instead.

00:44:21.296 --> 00:44:23.632
{\an8}Can you come to the station please?

00:44:23.699 --> 00:44:25.334
{\an8}What are you doing?

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:27.035
{\an8}The alibi has been proven wrong.

00:44:27.102 --> 00:44:28.003
{\an8}THIS DRAMA IS A FICTION

00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:28.971
