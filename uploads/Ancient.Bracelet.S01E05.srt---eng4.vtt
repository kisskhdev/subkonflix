00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.940
=Ancient Bracelet=

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.380
=Episode 5=

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.660
=I'll Keep You Safe=

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.320
If I kill you

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.640
by accident,

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.320
I could say you were killed

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.150
by the poison.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.710
Besides,

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.430
the chief is my uncle.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.710
Who do you think

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.880
he'll help,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.000
you or me?

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.280
Your Majesty, please don't go.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.130
Let go.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.000
Your Majesty!

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.480
If you keep drawing on your power

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.790
without the Frost Seal,

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.870
your life will be at risk.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.910
By then,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.310
even the Frost Seal

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.680
can't help you.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.310
(The Goddess's power is unique.)

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.240
(I've long suffered from the backlash.)

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.790
(Zhaoli took away my Frost Seal.)

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.590
(Yet she felt no backlash at all.)

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.480
(Could she be the Saintess Xihe
I've been looking for?)

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.510
I never thought that today,

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.710
this humble life of mine

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.350
would be of concern to so many.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.000
You're indeed humble.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.450
So, what makes you think

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.940
Che would care for you?

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.550
Oh, right.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.840
Isn't your secret lover formidable?

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.680
Today, I'll make you understand

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.760
that those men's affections
mean nothing.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.710
None of them can protect you.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.760
This is the magical artifact I obtained.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.120
Once it detonates,

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.040
you'll be slowly consumed by its power;

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.080
your organs will fail one after another.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.520
Wu Luoluo,

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.030
the harder you try to grasp something,

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.380
the further it slips from your hands.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.000
Even if you kill me,
you'll never have it.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.080
Then let's have a try.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.640
You...

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.470
Since you're here,

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.630
let's settle
old and new grudges together.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.630
(He and the husband from my dreams)

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.150
(share the same spell.)

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.710
From this day on,

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.520
I'll keep you safe.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.680
How about that?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.120
Your Majesty,

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.630
you just humiliated me;

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.030
now, you want to protect me?

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.280
What on earth are you doing?

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.220
About what happened today,

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.870
I'm sorry.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.310
It won't happen again.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:52.750
I don't believe you anymore.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.360
Ying Du.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:16.550
So cold.

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:18.510
The cold poison is acting up.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.480
(Ying Du,)

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.950
(without the Frost Seal,)

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.190
(your power has weakened greatly.)

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.680
(I can end you soon)

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.800
(and take your place.)

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.870
How strange.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.950
Why is his body still so cold?

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.640
You're awake.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:29.600
Ying Du,

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.610
are you out of your mind?

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.800
Why not tend to your wound first?

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.160
Once this poison goes into the organs...

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.600
That's none of your concern.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.760
Well.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.360
Since you're awake,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.950
leave now.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.680
I knew you wouldn't just watch me die.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.240
I'd save anyone, not just you.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.070
I didn't finish talking

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:01.360
in the daytime.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.070
What do you mean?

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:04.630
You're right.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.160
No one has the power
to decide your fate at will.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.160
Though the pain you suffered

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.310
was never my intention,

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.120
it still happened because of me.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:13.630
I know you don't believe me,

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.630
but I still want to tell you this.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.430
When I said I'd protect you,

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:21.600
I meant it.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.630
I wasn't toying with you.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.000
The ruler protecting a healer?

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.150
I think

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.070
you want to use me for something.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.630
Here's a deal.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.160
(As expected,)

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.630
(he wants something from me.)

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.240
My power has been acting strangely.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.950
Only when I make contact with you

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.800
can I fully wield it.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.270
So, I wish to form a pact with you.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.040
You'll be my link to channel power,

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.760
and I

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:55.800
will protect you in return.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:00.710
Of course,

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.390
I'll also use the Bracelet

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.720
to help you find the one
from your dreams.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:10.510
Why do you say

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.240
you can only use your power

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.000
when we are in contact?

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.360
(About our shared fate,)

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.600
(the fewer who know that, the better.)

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.240
When you were in the Palace,

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.170
we pretended to have consummation.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.160
Somehow,

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.680
I transferred my power to you.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.800
So, you came here for this.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:34.750
Why didn't you say so before?

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.560
I didn't want you to misunderstand.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.800
I never meant to keep it from you.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.880
Alright then.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:42.360
I'll agree to it.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.750
The ruler will safeguard me

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:45.930
and help me find someone.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:47.190
Why would I refuse such a thing?

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.630
(Zhaoli,)

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.510
(why does he make you feel
so disheartened?)

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.390
I did not summon you.

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.750
Why do you come on your own?

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:10.900
If the ruler were to learn...

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.660
With his present condition,

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.560
he cannot sense my presence at all.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.510
Besides,

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.270
he's not here, isn't he?

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.040
How dare you bring this up?

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:21.740
You once told me

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.500
that the healer has a rare constitution

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:24.830
and she can ease the ruler's pain

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:27.080
from the Frostbite Curse
caused by the Goddess's power.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.660
But now, the ruler is bewitched by her

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.920
and refuses to return.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.680
Please, calm your anger.

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:34.600
The ruler likely stays there

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.000
to reclaim his power.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.480
But if that healer

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:40.720
were gone,

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.960
the ruler's thoughts

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.600
would return to where they belong.

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.240
In that case,

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:49.360
end her life.
