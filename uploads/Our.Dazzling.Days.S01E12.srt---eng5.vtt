[Our Dazzling Days]

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.789
[Episode 12]

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.310
Mr. Ding.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.789
Xiaoman left you a letter.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.130
Left me what?

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:48.509
Left you a letter.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.340
Where is he?

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:51.590
He went to Shanghai.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.850
He left carrying a bag.

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.640
Where is the letter?

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.800
It's by the door.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.000
Uncle Ding, don't worry about me.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.030
I just don't want to sit around waiting

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.760
for Xiaodan and Xia Lei to call.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.250
I want to see them in person

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.030
and have a proper talk with them.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.960
Besides,

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.190
I've hardly

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.820
ever left East Chemical Plant in my life.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.230
I've only ever seen Shanghai in pictures
on calendars.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.030
I should go out and see the world.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:06.310
Well, uh...

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.910
Excuse me.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.800
Um, do you know
where the Architecture Department is?

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.260
The Architecture Department?
That's my department.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.060
You are?

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.520
I-In that case, do you know Xiaodan?

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.250
Yan Xiaodan?

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.079
What is her major,

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.810
and what's her concentration?

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.110
Architecture. Just... architecture.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.170
You don't go to this school, do you?

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.240
That building in the back,

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.079
Building No. 2,

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.810
is our main academic building.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Thank you. Thank you.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.630
No problem.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.079
No. 2... No. 2, right?

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.360
The one in the back!

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.450
Nice.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.560
If we keep building it
like Xiaodan is doing,

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.420
our group could take first place.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.680
You've built it so high.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.840
Should we add another piece? Well...

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.240
Let's try one more piece?

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.120
I don't really dare anymore.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.380
-Look at this—maybe we shouldn't.
-The structure isn't very stable.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.240
How about pushing it to the limit?

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:53.520
Let's add one more piece?

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.400
If it falls,

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.870
it'll be hard to rebuild.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:56.590
It won't.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.770
Let me think. Let me think.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.930
If I add another, I'll put it here...

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.470
Xiaodan.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.410
Do you know that guy?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.680
What guy?

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.400
That one.
He's been staring at you for a while.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.890
Xiaoman!

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.250
How did you get here?

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.310
I got... I got the letter you wrote me.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.160
So... So I came.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.470
Have you lost weight?

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.560
No. But your thing fell over.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.710
It's okay.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.909
My boyfriend.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.450
It's fine. Go back to class.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.060
You came all this way. I...

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.830
It's okay.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.000
I'm happy just staying with you,
whatever we do.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.030
Go ahead. I'll wait for you.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.490
-Okay. Wait for me.
-Okay.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.940
I'll come to you after class.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.420
Okay.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:53.870
Sorry. Sorry.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.050
I was so excited.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.560
What should we do now?
We were just saying we wanted first place.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.430
It's okay. We understand.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.960
Honestly, your boyfriend is
quite handsome.

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:04.790
He's really nice.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.200
Good for you.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.160
Xia Lei and I called Uncle Ding
a couple of days ago,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.420
but we couldn't get through to him at all.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.920
Yeah.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.120
Well... Uncle Ding's phone was broken,

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.780
so the call didn't go through.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.170
Does Xia Lei know you're here?

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.060
No, he doesn't.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.680
I didn't have time to tell him.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.940
I haven't told anyone.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:25.770
How about this?

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.620
We'll go back to my dorm in a bit.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.680
I'll call Xia Lei,

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.970
say there's something urgent,

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:30.870
and have him come over.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.110
Let's surprise him. What do you think?

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.870
That sounds good.

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:33.630
Let's scare him.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.680
-Yeah, yeah.
-Let's see how he reacts.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.120
Right.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.120
He won't see me

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.680
hiding here, right?

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.800
Right. Don't move.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.310
Don't move. Lower. Get lower.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:41.640
Why are you pressing me down?

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.870
Hurry. He's coming. He's coming.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:43.510
He can't see you.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.440
He can't see you.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.750
Is he here yet?

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:49.310
Almost, almost.

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:50.270
Don't move.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.120
It's just a few steps—he's still not here?

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.720
H-He's not very agile.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.830
All he's good at is studying.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:57.690
Still not here?

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.270
Almost, almost. He's here!

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.480
Xiaoman, happy birthday!

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.190
Happy birthday, Xiaoman!

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.510
Happy birthday!

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.210
Didn't expect it, huh?

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.510
Surprised?

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.360
Ready, go.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.510
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.040
♪ Happy birthday to Zhang Xiaoman ♪

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.870
Happy birthday, Xiaoman!

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.720
And congratulations on coming of age.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:23.450
Right.
Congratulations on becoming an adult!

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:24.560
You're an adult now.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.180
We should've put that hat on him just now.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.240
It's not too late to put it on now.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.890
Hurry up.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.510
Let him wear it and make a wish.

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.070
Come on.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.430
No. I... I...

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.270
Blessings in the candlelight.

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.000
No. I'll wear it as a scarf instead.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.860
-Around my neck.
-Let me help you.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.620
Okay, it's on.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:39.600
Does it look better like this?

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.720
It does. Hurry, make a wish.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.270
Okay. There are three candles here.

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.690
Just like the three of us.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:47.570
Together forever,

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.170
never apart.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.970
But you said your wish out loud—

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.980
does that mean it won't come true?

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.480
I think it really depends on what we do.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.270
And the three of us

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.870
have to work on
this particular wish together.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.540
-Blow them.
-Blow.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.830
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.170
Let me see what it says.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.480
May 21st—we all love you.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:10.640
Happy Coming-of-Age.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.270
That's quite romantic of you.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.130
It comes straight from the heart.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.720
You two are quite something.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.560
Y-You tricked me.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.310
She lied and said we should surprise you,

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.000
but it turns out
you two teamed up to surprise me.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.720
Well, your sudden arrival was
already a surprise in itself.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.480
And when Xiaodan first told me,

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:28.800
I was so stunned

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.510
I thought I'd misheard.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.630
So we threw this together in a rush.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.120
And this cake is just so-so.

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:36.430
Isn't it nice?

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:37.360
Three flowers—

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.890
like the three of us,
all blooming flowers.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.000
Blooming forever.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.270
The age of blooming.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.270
It's good! Very good!

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.510
Why are there no stars

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.110
in the Shanghai sky at night?

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.360
Maybe it's because of
the architectural nightscape—

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.360
all the lighting.

00:07:58.510 --> 00:07:59.240
What's that?

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.070
I just learned it. Basically,

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.510
decorative lighting on buildings

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.830
does brighten the city at night,

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.100
but it also washes out the starlight.

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:09.600
Gosh, that's a pity.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:11.610
Let's cut the cake.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.560
Come on.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:14.680
You do it.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:15.230
Come on.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.670
Where should I cut?

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:17.670
Cut here. Here.

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:23.650
You know, Magellan

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.000
traveled to so many places.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.430
But I bet he never went in circles

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.510
around the same spot this many times.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.560
Back in the old days,

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:32.870
you know what they'd call this?

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:33.510
What?

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:35.510
"A donkey pulling a millstone."

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.480
-Going round and round in the same spot.
-You're so annoying.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.360
What nonsense.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.270
But look,

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.270
this track doesn't have a finish line.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.120
And since there's no finish line,

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:45.840
we can

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:47.600
just keep walking

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:48.620
forever and ever.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.840
But we can't just keep going
in circles forever, right?

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:53.240
It's okay.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.240
I can accompany you wherever you go.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.480
And if you ever pull ahead,

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:00.270
I'll just run a few steps to catch up.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.510
Then, as you're running to catch up,
you'll look up

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:07.310
and find me right in front of you.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.760
Or you'll turn around and find me
still right behind you.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.390
Your school's environment

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:28.250
is really nice.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.850
Where do you want to take me?

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.010
Let's see if you can guess.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.640
What does Shanghai have

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.550
that the East Chemical Plant doesn't?

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:38.480
There's plenty.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.820
The Oriental Pearl Tower, right?

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:43.320
The Bund.
Our plant doesn't have that either.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.960
And that... that hotel.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.180
Our plant doesn't have that. None of it.

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:48.670
Wrong.

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:49.510
Then what is it?

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:50.720
I'll give you a hint.

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:54.510
I must be a kapok tree,
standing beside you.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.600
As trees, we stand together.

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:58.240
Right?

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:00.480
What?

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:02.270
Trees.

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:05.600
I-I haven't seen them yet.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.460
What do those two trees look like?

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:10.840
So we'll go to a park later
to find an oak tree

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.630
and see if there really is a kapok tree

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:14.920
standing right beside it.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:15.870
Sure.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.840
It's a deal.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:17.390
Let's go.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.270
It fell off.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:24.540
Dad.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.360
-Chief Engineer Yan.
-Xiaoman.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.480
You came all the way to Shanghai

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.340
and didn't come to say hello to me?

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.270
Well... um...

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:32.720
Wait, Dad.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.870
How did you know Xiaoman came to Shanghai?

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:35.360
Your Uncle Ding told me.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.360
He said you left a note and ran off.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.030
Right?

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:40.150
Yes.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.100
Don't you have classes today?

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:48.490
I have a general class
in the third period this afternoon.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:50.630
Alright, it's noon.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.150
Let's have lunch together.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.950
Let me check out the food
at your school cafeteria.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:10:59.870
You okay?

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.680
I'm fine.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.960
-It's nothing.
-Why did he suddenly

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.000
come to your school?

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.240
It's okay. Let's go.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.630
My dad knows
we celebrated your birthday belatedly,

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:08.380
so he specifically ordered
a bowl of birthday noodles for you.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:08.840
Really?

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.150
There's no cake,

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.720
so just make do with
a bowl of longevity noodles, okay?

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.510
Thank you, Uncle Yan.

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:17.150
See?

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:18.150
You got what you wanted.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.790
There's seafood here.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:21.120
We asked them to
add it especially for you.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:23.280
I wonder how it tastes.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:24.150
Let me try it.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:27.790
How is it?

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:30.600
I'm telling you,

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:32.860
this is the best bowl of noodles
I've ever had.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:33.700
Then eat more.

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:37.510
Xiaoman.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.720
My transfer order came so suddenly
this time

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.670
that I rushed to Shanghai.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.960
Otherwise, by all rights,

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:47.030
I should've personally gone to
pick you up.

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:48.120
No need. It's fine.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.440
Uh... Mr. Ding picked me up.

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:51.670
It was nothing, actually.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.120
I went straight home.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.150
Everything went smoothly.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:55.000
Speaking of which,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.510
I really have to thank you.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.910
If you hadn't stood up for Xiaodan,

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:01.770
she wouldn't have gotten into college
so smoothly.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:04.120
No. A-Actually,

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:05.510
that had nothing to do with her
to begin with.

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:06.840
I caused the trouble.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.120
If anything, I dragged Xiaodan into it.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:09.910
Whoever it was—

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:11.120
you or Xiaodan—

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.510
as long as you're kids from our plant,

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:14.320
it's my responsibility
to look out for you.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:14.720
Yes.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.120
Dad, we're eating.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.120
Why bring this up?

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.920
Are you going to let us eat or not?

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:21.270
I can't eat.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.340
How about this?

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.360
Go buy some drinks for us.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.240
I'll go. I'll go.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:25.550
What do you want?

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:26.510
No, you don't know the area.

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:28.360
Let Xiaodan go. Go buy some drinks.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.150
W-What do you want to drink?

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:30.410
Whatever. You decide.

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:32.720
Okay. The card's with me.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:38.970
Xiaoman.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:43.150
You... didn't even say a word

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.280
and just ran off to Shanghai like that.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.960
Do you know how worried Uncle Ding was

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.000
when he called me?

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.150
I know.

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:53.840
I really didn't think it through
this time.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.720
I wanted to wait for Xiaodan's call
at home,

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.000
but it d-didn't come.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.750
I got anxious and just rushed over.

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:02.510
I handled this poorly.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:04.110
I really have to lecture you.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:06.080
You're a grown-up now,

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:06.720
right?

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:09.510
You can't just act on impulse anymore.

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:12.400
You have to learn to
consider other people's feelings—

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.360
especially those who care about you,
love you,

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.490
and worry about you.

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:16.970
Yes, I understand.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.150
It's just this once.

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.910
I promise I won't do it again.

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:20.750
No next time, alright?

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:21.360
Yes.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:22.720
Eat up.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:27.570
You know, Xiaoman,

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.510
I went to great lengths to

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:32.750
get transferred back to Shanghai
this time.

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:34.480
It was all for Xiaodan.

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:37.120
I can't guarantee

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.150
I can pave the way for her whole life,

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.090
but at least I have to
get her out of the mountains.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:47.020
Xiaodan has always been a good student.

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:48.370
She's good at everything.

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:51.080
I believe she'll succeed in the future.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:52.880
She'll realize all her dreams.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.440
I hope she'll have a future
full of possibilities.

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:00.720
I can't let her future be bound to
the East Chemical Plant.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.650
Don't you agree?

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.850
Chief Engineer Yan.

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:17.000
I... I came this time

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.390
and saw Xiaodan studying here.

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:21.510
The school's good.

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:22.510
Everything is great.

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:25.510
Honestly, I feel... reassured.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.120
I won't stay long.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.380
I'll go back tomorrow.

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:35.080
That's not what I meant.
Stay as long as you like.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.110
It's fine. Since I left home

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.670
and came straight to Shanghai,

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:39.990
I should visit family while I'm here.

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.870
Right, right.

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.670
Give them my regards when you see them.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:44.380
No problem.

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:49.080
Also... whatever comes up
back at the plant,

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:50.760
call me directly.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:52.750
Okay.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:57.030
Eat more.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.110
What are you two chatting about?

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:00.170
Just random stuff.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:08.760
What's wrong?

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.150
Nothing.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.280
Just chatting about things back home.

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:13.630
Eat more.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.450
Let me take you to the station.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.280
No need.

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:19.620
Just focus on your classes.

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:20.510
Tell me honestly—

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:21.360
when I went to buy drinks,

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.090
did my dad say something to you?

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:23.910
We were having a good time.

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:25.150
Why are you leaving all of a sudden?

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:26.670
He didn't say anything.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:29.470
For real?

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:30.410
For real.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.320
Then why are you leaving?

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.580
Didn't you say you'd stay a few more days?

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.310
Because I don't want to
just spend these few days with you.

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:41.910
I want to be with you forever.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.030
So I have to go back

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:46.770
to prepare for our future.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:53.150
But I don't know

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:54.950
when we'll see each other again.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.670
There are still so many places in Shanghai

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:57.800
I haven't shown you.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:04.120
It's okay. As long as I get to see you,
this trip to Shanghai is enough.

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:22.870
Alright, go back to class. I'm leaving.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:24.770
Go on.

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:40.790
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.260
we are arriving at Shanhaiguan Station!

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.510
Passengers disembarking,
please take your belongings

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:48.310
and get ready to leave the train!

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.790
Almost there. I need to grab a spot.

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:50.620
Young man.

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:52.670
What's in that drawing?

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.420
You've looked at it several times.

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.260
It's a drawing of our plant.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.850
-Hey, watch it.
-I'm sorry.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:01.470
Finally found a spot.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:06.720
Young man.

00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:09.550
You're pretty young.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:15.040
It's not a holiday or anything.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.079
Is it easy to take time off
from university?

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:21.240
I-I'm not a university student.

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.750
I came to visit friends.

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:25.069
I'm sorry.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:27.490
Now that you mention it...

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.890
you really don't look like one.

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:36.080
This drawing is quite nice.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:37.980
My girlfriend drew this for me.

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:39.640
Your girlfriend drew this?

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.160
Yeah.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.720
She's really good.

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:45.720
She's a college student, right?

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.240
Yeah.

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:51.680
She studies architecture
at Shanghai... Tongzhou University.

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:53.720
Impressive!

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:55.550
Shanghai Tongzhou University—

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:57.010
that's really something!

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:58.880
That university is amazing.

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.840
They say graduates from there

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:03.720
are highly sought after in the job market.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:04.320
Is that so?

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:05.260
You're screwed.

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:06.130
She's definitely

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:07.730
going to settle in Shanghai.

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:09.640
What are you going to do?

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.350
Alright, alright, you sit tight.

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:15.000
Just sit.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:15.880
I gotta get off.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.020
Okay, okay.

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:36.520
Mr. Ding.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.860
I-I've been thinking lately.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:40.750
Well, I'm thinking of

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:41.750
going to Shanghai to find work.

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:43.480
Do you think that's a good path?

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:45.550
What can you do there?

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:49.360
Haul sacks on a construction site?

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.740
Enduring hardship isn't a skill.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.510
Young people are all the same.

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:55.590
I was young once, too.

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:56.790
I've been there.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:58.770
What you're saying...

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.600
Don't you want to give...

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.200
give Xiaodan a—what do you call it?

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.960
A happy and stable life?

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:06.540
Of course I do.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.840
Go to technical school then.

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:10.000
Turning, fitting, milling,
planing, and welding—

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.660
master just one,
and you'll never be out of work.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.680
The technical school's already
started its term.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.410
How am I supposed to enroll now?

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:20.110
Tell me.
What did you do with Xiaoman this time?

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.200
He came to Shanghai to find me.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.110
Like a dream... It feels like a dream.

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:27.350
And a sweet one.

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:29.590
Do you know what the best part
of a sweet dream is?

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:31.400
It's when it comes true!

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:32.750
I know.

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:36.350
Look how happy you are.

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.880
I could tell you liked him
back in high school.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.730
Who was it that kept denying it?

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:43.000
Really? Did I deny it?

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:45.310
I guess... I guess that did happen.

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:46.750
But back then,

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.610
didn't the teachers always think

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.550
you and Xia Lei were together?

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:51.200
Exactly.

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:53.720
We got called to the office

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.000
because of some cheating incident.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.590
Then, out of nowhere, the teacher asked,

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:57.880
"Are you two dating?"

00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.770
Gave me such a fright.

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:01.970
I was so afraid of being misunderstood.

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.950
By the way,

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:05.430
I remember...

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:08.720
isn't your school
quite close to Xia Lei's?

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.590
It'd be so convenient for you two
to look out for each other.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:12.790
Why not consider him?

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:15.380
We were desk mates in high school.

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:18.200
If I were interested,
it would've happened ages ago.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.800
It was never going to happen.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:21.750
Why...

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:24.640
don't you like him?

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.050
He was a top student.
First in the whole school.

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:28.690
Then why don't you like him?

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.880
Didn't you grow up together?

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:33.470
True.

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:35.440
You need to like the person,

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.430
not a class ranking.

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:39.540
Xiaoman was dead last,

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:41.200
but I still like him, right?

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Xia Lei...

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.480
My impression of him is that...

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:52.610
he's always been preparing for exams

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.330
and rushing somewhere,

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.660
but I never knew where he was headed.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:57.830
And I always felt

00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:59.640
he didn't know where he was headed either.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:00.160
So...

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.690
what is there to like about him?

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:05.940
That makes sense.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.320
What do you think of Xiaoman?

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:09.310
Xiaoman?

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:11.410
Just like his name,

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.000
the little East Chemical Plant

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.800
is enough to satisfy
all his expectations in life.

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:20.110
What about me?

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.270
You?

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:26.350
You...

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:29.330
are pretty fickle.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:31.750
Me? Fickle?

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:33.880
I don't mean romantically.

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:37.480
I think you're pretty fickle
toward the world.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.160
But it's exactly because of
that "fickleness"

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.420
that you can always pursue what you want.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:49.930
Director Liu.

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:52.350
Well, how did you two end up
coming here together?

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:53.150
Go have a seat.

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:55.880
We

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:58.320
came today about Xiaoman.

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:01.080
We were hoping
you could help get him into school.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.550
For enrollment,
you need to talk to the school.

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:05.720
True, but...

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:07.750
we thought if the organization could
put in a word,

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:09.810
it would be easier to get things done.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.530
Dr. Tong,

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.000
I just

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.660
push papers in the office now.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:17.150
I really have no influence
over the school.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:18.440
Besides,

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:22.090
the organization can't
take care of everything, can it?

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:25.350
But Xiaoman is a good kid.

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:27.910
He was retaliated against
for doing a good deed.

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:29.540
That Feng Xiaobo he hit—

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:31.490
he's a little thug.

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.200
He did it to protect himself

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:33.900
and his classmates.

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:35.140
It was self-defense.

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:37.590
I know all that.

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.790
But...

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.020
Then tell me,

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:41.550
if he can't get into technical school

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:42.880
b-because of this,

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:44.580
he can't become a worker.

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:46.200
Then he won't have a job.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:46.920
And without a job,

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.720
won't his whole life be finished
before it starts?

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:53.110
I understand everything you're saying.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.640
We all watched

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.350
Xiaoman grow up.

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.750
Yes.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.240
Back then,

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:01.000
when his grandma ran that newsstand,

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
I was the one who helped apply for it.

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:06.640
And that year
at the plant anniversary celebration,

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.610
he and that... what's his name... Sen?

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:09.330
Zhuang Sen.

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.070
Right, right.

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:12.200
They made a scene on stage,

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:14.880
and I got dragged into trouble
for that later.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.730
After his grandma passed away,

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:19.880
I ran around taking care of everything

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.310
I could for him.

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:24.270
Okay, I know about

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:25.200
this matter.

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:26.530
I'll report it to the leadership,

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:27.350
and we'll discuss it in a meeting...

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:28.350
Alright, alright, Liu.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:29.660
Spare me this "report and discuss"

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.120
bureaucratic runaround.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:32.790
What's the use of
spouting that useless crap?

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:34.640
What? Is this our first day here?

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:37.270
Every time you officials
start talking like that,

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:39.360
the plant just waits for your meetings.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.070
The plant can wait for your meetings,

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:41.350
but can Xiaoman wait for it?

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:43.000
No, Ding, stop getting so agitated.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.200
We... we're just discussing this...

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:44.750
Who's agitated?

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:45.590
Since I came in, entering the room,

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:46.640
did I say a word?

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:48.350
Wasn't it you who wound me up?

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:51.070
Always talking about the good deeds
you've done.

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:52.590
What, afraid we won't know?

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:53.660
Only talking about the good parts!

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.400
Well, if I don't say it, you won't know.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:55.880
Listen up—

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.720
frankly, who's to blame
for Xiaoman's situation?

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.980
It's our plant's fault, I'm telling you!

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:02.590
If only the plant had
had effective management measures

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:03.590
and been a bit stricter,

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:04.160
don't you agree?

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.750
If the plant had implemented
more effective measures across the board,

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:08.750
would Xiaoman—a mere kid,

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:09.720
a little brat—

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:11.950
have needed to report
that gas station?

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000
Would he have ended up
in juvenile detention?

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.550
Would he have lost his schooling?

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:16.750
Don't you have a clue?

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:18.290
Ding, I don't like hearing you say that.

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:19.310
So what if you don't like it?

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:19.590
Well,

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:21.350
Director Meng stepped in back then!

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:22.880
I wasn't afraid to slap him in the face
back then,

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.540
and I'm not afraid to do it now!

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.730
He could step in back then,
so why can't he now?

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:29.730
Fine! I won't argue with you.

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:31.930
Always waving your arms around.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.310
Dr. Tong,

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:35.850
here's the situation:

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.000
now, the school and the hospital

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:41.670
are gradually being separated
from the plant.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:43.070
The technical school now

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:45.000
falls under the local education bureau.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.750
We don't have a say anymore.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.590
Then just let Xiaoman
come back to work here!

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:54.680
Listen up,

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.310
you have to find a future for him.

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:57.960
Right. You have to help him.

00:24:58.590 --> 00:24:59.050
Well...

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:02.000
H-How am I supposed to find one for him?

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:05.440
Don't glare at me.

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:06.920
I just remembered something.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:10.750
The technical school is
under local management now,

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.110
but Principal Jin of the school

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:15.550
came from our plant.

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:16.640
Who? Jin Fu?

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:18.070
It's "Jin Changfu."

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.750
Jin Changfu.

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:20.400
Right. So here's what you do—

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.070
find Principal Jin.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.270
As long as the technical school
agrees to accept Xiaoman,

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:25.510
the organization will

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:28.350
give you its full cooperation on
everything else. Okay?

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:29.500
Does your word count?

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:30.630
Of course it counts.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:31.790
Come on, Tong Guizhen, let's go.

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:32.350
I'll handle this.

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:32.880
Don't waste time with him.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.740
It's useless. Let's go. Let's go.

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.750
You downed it in one go.

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:39.750
My senior can still hold his liquor.

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:41.410
Put it there.

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:42.400
I'll pour myself.

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.550
Good baijiu. Saved it for years.

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:44.720
We never had the heart to drink it.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.590
Senior, you are so hospitable.

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:46.200
So hospitable.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:46.960
-Yes.
-So hospitable.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.350
-Drink more.
-You go open

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:48.750
that bottle.

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:49.590
-No, no, no.
-Okay!

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:50.680
T-There's more here!

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.750
No, no. Enough, enough.

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:52.530
I really appreciate it!

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:53.350
We'll buy more if there's none left.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:54.000
We'll go buy more.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:54.860
Keep drinking.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.420
-We're happy today.
-Yes.

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:58.070
You've made something of yourself now.

00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:00.330
We haven't seen each other in a long time.

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:01.310
Do you remember

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:04.110
when you were...
still a worker in the plant back then?

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:04.680
That time,

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.750
didn't you get into a fight with thieves?

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:09.130
-Yeah.
-He was so rash!

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.880
That was... He was truly young.

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:11.750
As fearless as a newborn calf!

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:12.350
He went out alone

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:14.210
and took on three guys by himself.

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:15.410
One against three!

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:16.750
Good for you.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.200
But frankly speaking,

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.050
if I, your senior, hadn't stepped in,

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:20.920
if I hadn't acted,

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:21.590
if I hadn't helped,

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:22.590
your two hands—

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.200
let's be honest—
wouldn't you have lost them?

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:25.550
Right, right.

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:26.830
You'd have been left with
just two stumps, right?

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:28.160
What are you saying?

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.030
True story!

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:29.960
That's true?

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:30.960
Really. Really.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:31.830
I owe

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:33.310
my life to my senior.

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.200
But about Xiaoman's situation...

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.330
What about Xiaoman?

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:40.860
What's wrong? What's wrong with Xiaoman?

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:41.390
Exactly.

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:43.200
In a sense,

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.520
isn't he just like you?

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:46.540
When he saw someone being bullied

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:49.750
and the country's interests being harmed,

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.920
he rushed in without a second thought!

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.160
Back in the day, y-you were awarded

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.720
the "Heroic Citizen," right?

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:56.850
What about Xiaoman?

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.350
Fine.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.400
We accept that we get nothing.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.590
We accept it with no complaints.

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:03.500
But how can you deny him his schooling
over this?

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:05.430
Exactly. Look what a good kid he is.

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:06.440
Everyone at the plant says

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.570
Xiaoman is a good kid

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:08.590
whenever he's mentioned.

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:10.240
Yes, right!

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.700
However... the school rules

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:14.090
are set in stone.

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:14.650
No, wait.

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:20.910
Slow down, Senior.

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:21.930
Jin.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:24.110
Right.

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:28.240
You're now the principal
of the technical school.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.760
So what if you're the principal?

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.580
You don't care about
your fellow workers anymore?

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:36.350
Senior...

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:38.350
Your status rises, your vision rises,

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:39.810
and ours stays low, is that it?

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:40.350
How could that be?

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:42.070
Senior, what are you saying?

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:45.200
Well, it's precisely because
I'm the principal

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.200
that I can't break the rules,

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:48.000
right?

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:48.960
The key issue is

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.310
that Xiaoman didn't take
the college entrance exam.

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:53.510
He has no student registration
and no scores.

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:55.920
How can I let him enroll directly
without the exam?

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:56.750
For that,

00:27:56.750 --> 00:28:00.410
he'll probably have to wait
until next year to take the exam again.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:01.520
Can we do this?

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:05.640
See if this is possible.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:06.920
As the principal,

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:10.750
could you allow a student
to audit classes?

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.200
That's possible.

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:13.660
Then, as the principal,

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:15.860
can you let a student skip a grade?

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:17.970
That's also possible.

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:20.560
Exactly. Plenty of students skip grades.

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:21.560
No problem.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:22.750
Alright then.

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:24.080
I'll have a drink first.

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:26.590
Slow down.

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:28.620
You'll choke again.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.660
You always down it in one gulp.

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:35.310
Here's the situation.

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:40.150
There is a student. He missed the exam.

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:43.480
Let him audit classes first,

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:48.270
then take the entrance exam next year.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:49.830
If he passes,

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:53.190
let him skip to the second year.
How about that?

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:55.490
Let me think it through...

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.260
That's a good idea.

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:02.470
That's why you're my senior!

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:04.000
You really have a lot of ideas!

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:04.680
See?

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:06.410
This works.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.450
I've always had a rigid mind.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.000
That's our Ding for you!

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.200
Come on!

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:13.250
It's settled?

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:14.750
Let me pour you some. Have some.

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:16.720
-Here.
-Don't drink too much.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:17.750
No more words.

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.630
We're real brothers. Bottoms up!

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:21.850
Slow down. Slow down.

00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:26.510
You're a true friend.

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:27.610
My good brother.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.200
Don't worry. For our factory's children,

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.660
schooling is guaranteed.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.370
You should've been
Party Secretary long ago!

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:38.080
We thank you
from the bottom of our hearts.

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:40.240
Xiaoman, today you've got to tell me.

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:42.180
I heard you were holding a knife then,

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:43.970
and with one stab, you pierced

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:45.640
Feng Xiaobo's stomach.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.310
When he was running down the street,

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:49.240
his intestines were spilling out.

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:53.370
He was just holding them
while running all over the street.

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:56.110
Is that true? Man, you're fierce.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.240
I really admire people like you.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.610
What are you on about? That's not true.

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:03.160
But I don't regret it.

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.410
Regret wouldn't change anything.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.080
Do you remember Sun Lulu?

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:08.990
What about her?

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:10.520
We're really together now!

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.110
Thanks to the letter

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:14.550
you wrote for me back then.

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:17.240
If not for you, neither of us
would've said anything first—

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.770
who knows
how long we would've dragged it out?

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.240
Sun Lulu...

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:29.130
Treat her well.

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:30.070
Treat her well.

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:30.530
Will do.

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.310
Attention, everyone.

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:37.710
We're having class in this workshop today.

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:39.320
There are tools everywhere.

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:41.480
Don't touch any tools

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:43.030
unrelated to your studies. Understood?

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:44.630
-Understood!
-Understood!

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:46.260
Last time, I went over

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:48.000
the safety precautions for welding.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:48.880
Do you all remember them?

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.000
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:51.190
You should remember them well.

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:54.050
I don't care whether you become
good welders or not,

00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:56.720
but you must remember
the safety precautions.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.880
I'm not joking.

00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:59.440
I had a student once.

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:01.800
He didn't pay attention in class.

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:04.760
Later on the job, he made a mistake.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.730
He was electrocuted
while replacing the welding rod.

00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:09.660
Aren't welding gloves insulated?

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.610
Welding gloves are insulated.

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:13.760
But he sweated through them.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.970
The electrode holder
jolted him off his feet,

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:19.880
and he landed right back on it.

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:21.880
As a result, electricity went through
his whole body.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.540
And he was gone just like that!

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:25.400
I had another student.

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:27.880
Because he didn't check the surroundings,

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:30.080
some molten slag fell to the floor below

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.880
and set it on fire.

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:33.720
He was trapped upstairs

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:35.720
and burned alive!

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.900
So you must be careful!

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:40.680
And I had yet another student.

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:43.080
He was careless
when changing the gas tank.

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:44.110
It exploded.

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:46.920
You all know how powerful a gas tank is!

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.160
He was blown to pieces!

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:51.470
You can imagine that scene.

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:54.730
Mr. Teng, was your master
Old Heretic Huang?

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.360
Was your master Old Heretic Huang?

00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:59.900
You are Old Heretic Huang!

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:01.880
From what you've just said yourself,
aren't you basically the same?

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.610
Your students are
like Old Heretic Huang's disciples—

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:06.210
hardly any of them survived.

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.270
Believe it or not.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.370
I'm telling you,

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:15.850
if you don't believe me...
feel free to keep spacing out.

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.110
Watch closely!

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:18.000
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:18.570
Okay.

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:28.750
This is one of those trulli in Italy.

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.720
Beautiful, isn't it?

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.000
-It's beautiful.
-Very nice.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000
Very nice.

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:33.480
I took these
after the college entrance exam

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.740
when I went traveling.

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:35.880
I've got plenty more.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.480
Is this Alberobello in Italy—

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:38.790
the "Paradise Town"?

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.030
I read somewhere

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:43.130
that there are thousands of
these stone-roofed houses left there.

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:44.440
It's so beautiful.

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:46.110
Your photo looks even better
than the reference material.

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:47.270
That's straight from the source.

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:47.960
You like it?

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.000
It really is well taken.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.200
I'll print a set for you.

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.480
Sure. Thanks.

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:55.720
This is a stone house

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.380
in the town of Yvoire, France.

00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:59.110
I went there in high school.

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:00.480
But at that time,

00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:03.000
I didn't take proper photos
or keep records.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.680
All I took were tourist snapshots.

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:05.980
They were completely useless.

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:07.640
-That's a pity.
-What a shame.

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:09.680
But I didn't go inside this stone house.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:10.410
Did you go in?

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:12.790
No. It was under protection when I went.

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:16.030
But I went to that one. Wait a second.

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:21.750
This looks nice.

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:22.790
This place is really beautiful!

00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:23.310
You've been there?

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:24.110
I haven't.

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.510
Have you been inside this one?

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:27.110
No.

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.230
I remember it was really cool inside.

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:31.140
And on the dining table inside,

00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:33.370
there was a 14th-century candlestick.

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.110
A 14th-century candlestick?

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.790
Xiaodan?

00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:38.330
You really should go see it sometime.

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:41.720
Bro, stop working out.

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:44.110
The more you exercise, the hungrier I get.

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:45.270
If I burn a few more calories now,

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:46.800
I can eat more later, right?

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.880
What took you so long?

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.140
Let's go. Let's go eat.

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.300
I'm not going. You guys go ahead.

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:56.270
Why not?

00:33:57.790 --> 00:33:59.310
I'm going to
the hometown association gathering.

00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:01.440
I want to get to know people
from my hometown.

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.680
You should've said that earlier—
we've been waiting for you.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:05.670
Bring back some goodies
after the gathering.

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:06.260
Sure.

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:08.270
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:14.050
This one... He is, right?

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:15.590
Hey, man.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:16.840
Is this
the hometown association gathering?

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:17.880
Yes. You're here for it, right?

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:18.670
Yes. I'm from Tiecheng.

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:19.469
Right, right.

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:20.190
We were just waiting for you.

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:21.320
There's an empty seat here!

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:21.880
Sit here.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:22.960
I'll sit over there.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:23.710
Okay. Sit.

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:27.320
How about some beer?

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:27.800
Thanks.

00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:29.280
Take off your bag.

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.940
Everyone's pretty much here.

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:32.480
Fellow townsmen,

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.400
hello everyone. You all know me, right?

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.590
-Yes, we do!
-Yeah!

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:37.670
I won't waste your time
introducing myself then.

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:38.280
No need.

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.880
Who doesn't know you, Director Zheng?

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.320
Exactly. Who doesn't know you?

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:42.409
He's the third vice director
of the Student Union's

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:43.670
External Relations Department—

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:44.110
last name Zheng.

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:46.320
Look at the environment
we're eating in today.

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.480
Doesn't it look like the peaks and ridges

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:50.110
of our hometown?

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:50.670
-It does!
-Yeah!

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:52.480
They surround us tightly.

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:52.900
Exactly.

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:54.460
Once we gather like this,

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:56.710
doesn't that warmth from home
come right back?

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:57.880
-It's back!
-It's back!

00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.030
-It's all back!
-Yeah!

00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.670
It's back!

00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:00.320
Since it's back,

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.480
let's have a drink first!

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:03.230
-Cheers!
-Bottoms up!

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:03.800
Cheers!

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:09.320
As they say, when fellow townspeople meet,
the feeling is something else.

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.000
I propose

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:11.710
that our newer members

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:13.760
introduce themselves

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:15.110
in their hometown dialect. How about it?

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:15.880
-Okay!
-Yeah!

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.540
Who wants to go first? Come on!

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.280
Hello, everyone!

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.440
I'm Zhao Zhiyong.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.550
I'm from Beita!

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:27.110
Anyone who treats me to
a bowl of cold noodles

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:28.840
is my sworn brother for life!

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:29.710
-Great!
-Yeah!

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:30.600
I'll treat you!

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:36.430
My name is Guan Shengnan.

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:38.130
I'm from the countryside.

00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:40.920
I went to high school in Erdaogou Town.

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:42.760
Back home,

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.670
we distinguish
between rural and urban areas.

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:46.150
But we are in Shanghai now.

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:47.110
We're all...

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:47.550
Right.

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:50.290
-From the countryside!
-From the countryside!

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.960
Who's next?

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:56.070
Uh...

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.670
My name is Xia Lei.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.230
I can't speak the Tiecheng dialect.

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:01.670
I'm from the East Chemical Plant.

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:03.670
I'm studying
communication engineering here.

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:04.960
-Good!
-Yeah!

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.160
-Welcome!
-Welcome!

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:09.920
Buddy.

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.880
You're from the East Chemical Plant?

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:12.480
Yes.

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.920
No wonder your outfit is so weird.

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.360
It's normal for someone like you
not to speak

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.620
our Tiecheng dialect.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.470
After all, you claim to be from
the East Chemical Plant

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:26.000
and never mention the region.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:26.780
There he goes again.

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:28.510
Alright, why start this again?

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.120
I think you're pretty weird!

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.780
He is from the East Chemical Plant.

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:32.840
Why can't he say it?

00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:35.260
Hey there.

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:39.190
I think you look good today.

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:41.360
Right. It looks very nice!

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.110
See? Our sister knows how to talk.

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:43.710
Right?

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:46.110
Suits are for formal occasions.

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:46.840
Right?

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:47.110
-Yes.
-Right!

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:49.070
That shows he takes our gathering
very seriously!

00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:50.320
Yes, he values it!

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:51.340
My turn!

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:53.590
I'm Fan Weijie,

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:55.480
a sophomore majoring in finance!

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:57.480
I didn't get the chance
to hang out with you

00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:58.610
in my freshman year.

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:00.230
I've always regretted that!

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:01.880
I hope you fellow townsmen
will look out for me!

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:02.940
I'll drink to that!

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.480
Yeah.

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:04.480
Come on, we'll drink with you!

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:06.510
-Come on!
-Bottoms up!

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:07.870
Wait a second.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.800
Where is your hometown?

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:14.030
Don't tell me
you're from East Chemical Plant too?

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:15.110
I grew up

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:17.270
in the same village as Director Zheng.

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:19.290
We were raised on millet rice.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.590
I've got more stories
than gray hairs in my beard.

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:21.390
What's wrong?

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:22.280
So...

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.440
does Director Zheng have to call you...

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.190
"Uncle"?

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:28.110
Nonsense!

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:29.800
Director Zheng

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:31.480
is from the city!

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:32.840
City, countryside—

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.440
now that we're in Shanghai, we're all...

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.280
-From the countryside!
-From the countryside!

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.030
All us country folk, let's drink together!

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.670
Come on!

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:39.110
Bottoms up!

00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:40.170
To us country folk!

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:41.190
Come on. Cheers!

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.670
-Cheers!
-Yeah!

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:43.130
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.230
Come on, everyone, dig in.

00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:48.290
Eat while it's hot!

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.450
Thanks for earlier.

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:53.960
No big deal. We're from the same hometown.

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:55.390
But we can't blame him.

00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:58.210
We're just different from the locals
in Shanghai.

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:02.900
Yeah, of course we're different.

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:04.670
You look quite tacky.

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:07.800
You said earlier

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.800
that I value this gathering,

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:11.190
and that's why I dressed like this.

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:12.280
I was trying to help you out.

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.230
Couldn't you tell?

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:14.320
You got it wrong.

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:16.710
Look at your outfit. It's so countrified.

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:18.310
Come on, stand up. Let me see.

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:20.590
How is my outfit countrified?

00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:21.480
I wasn't wrong, was I?

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:22.280
See that?

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.360
A belt with punched holes.

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.480
Look at that belt—so outdated.

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:25.840
It's even peeling.

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.320
So many holes.

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:30.530
That's not what a boss's belt looks like.

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:32.770
What kind of belt does a boss wear?

00:38:32.770 --> 00:38:33.640
A boss's belt?

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:36.670
Come on, let me show you

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:38.330
what a boss's belt looks like.

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:40.510
This is a belt a boss would wear.

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:43.070
See this? Clean, neat.

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:43.920
It never peels.

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.380
One smooth pull—no holes.

00:38:46.070 --> 00:38:47.800
What do you like to clip on your waist?

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:48.670
My keychain.

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:49.810
Shanghai locals

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:52.110
clip on phone pouches, you know?

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:55.920
You open it and slip your phone in—
so convenient!

00:38:56.070 --> 00:38:57.550
Clip on this kind of belt

00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:59.670
and wear this phone case.

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:01.480
Then who would say
you're a country bumpkin?

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:02.110
Right?

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:03.670
Well...

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:05.920
this kind of belt
must be expensive, right?

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:06.920
Of course.

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:08.150
In stores, yeah.

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:09.450
But I have a source.

00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:11.380
I can get you top-grade knockoffs—

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:12.880
the best quality around.

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:14.480
And cheap. Want one?

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:15.570
Sure! Get me one.

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:16.860
Hold on. Wait a second.

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:20.430
Did you go around the dorms
selling leather shoes before?

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:23.110
Yeah.

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:25.920
Listen to me, everyone.

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.880
This guy is a scammer.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:29.590
The head of my dorm

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.190
went to the Mianyang
hometown association gathering.

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:34.030
He told me he met a guy from his hometown

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:35.480
and bought a pair of

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:37.630
Norrona leather shoes from him.

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:41.630
The leather cracked
after less than a week.

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:44.760
Let me ask you, was that you?

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:47.300
Aren't you from Mianyang?

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.180
Since when are you from Tiecheng?

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:51.630
On my grandmother's side,

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:53.230
I really am from Mianyang.

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.050
Who cares which side you claim!

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:57.140
What are you doing?

00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:58.480
-Hey, don't get physical!
-What do you think you're doing?

00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.670
Why don't you take out your ID card

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:00.920
and show it to everyone?
That'll settle it.

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:01.920
I've noticed something—

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:04.230
he's been picking on us country folks
from the start.

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:05.920
Director Zheng, see? I told you.

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.460
It's not easy for us
to get together like this!

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:09.530
I don't know what it is about Tiecheng

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:11.440
that produces someone like him!

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:12.110
Don't get angry.

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:13.020
It's no fun anymore.

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:13.480
Well...

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:16.520
With that glib tongue of his,

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:19.120
he doesn't seem like
he's from Tiecheng to me.

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:23.670
Xiaoyi!

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:25.400
Weijie?

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:27.590
-Come join us.
-It's been so long.

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:28.440
Long time no see.

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:30.110
That belt last time was really nice.

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:30.590
Not bad, right?

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:32.800
-Yeah.
-I just got a new batch of phone pouches.

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:33.830
Do you want to take a look?

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:34.440
Let me see.

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:34.840
Look.

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.920
I really didn't expect this.

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:39.320
A small Tiecheng
hometown association gathering,

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:41.110
and we ended up with two impostors.

00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:42.510
That's enough. Sit down.

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:43.670
Stop talking.

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:45.130
Well...

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:47.110
Why is the mood so down?

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:49.040
Come on. Let's have another drink.

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:49.960
He left, so let him go.

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:51.320
But we should stay happy,

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:52.110
-right?
-Right.

00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:53.480
It's not easy for us to get together!

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:53.960
Come on.

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.670
Cheers.

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:55.480
Director Zheng,

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:57.580
I just remembered I've got something to do
this afternoon.

00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:58.510
So I'll be going.

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.660
You've barely touched your food.

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:02.330
Stay a little longer.

00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:03.440
Yeah, what could be more important

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.110
than a hometown gathering?

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:07.070
There's

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:09.800
no one else here
from the East Chemical Plant!

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.070
You guys,

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:13.280
why are you all so petty?

00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:16.410
I really have something to do.

00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:18.210
Director Zheng, how about this?

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.660
Since we're having a meal here,

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:21.260
shouldn't we split the bill?

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:21.920
Take this.

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.050
Put your money away.

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:25.090
Alright, I won't keep you.

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:26.400
But today's meal

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:27.070
is on me.

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:29.750
I'm treating
all my little brothers and sisters.

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:31.230
Let's keep in touch from now on.

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:33.290
Just let me know if you need anything.

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:34.070
Put it away.

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:35.670
Okay. I'm sorry, Director Zheng.

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:36.190
It's fine.

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:37.110
I really have something to do.
I'll get going.

00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:37.830
Okay, okay.

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:43.630
Come on, everyone.

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:44.230
Come on.

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:45.440
Let them leave.

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:46.880
Let's keep drinking.

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.550
Come on!

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:50.360
Hey!

00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:53.590
Bro, call me if you need anything.

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:54.110
Okay.

00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:58.120
Wait. Wait a second.

00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.200
What's wrong?

00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:02.720
Come sit for a while.

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:04.060
Sit with me.

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:04.840
Come on.

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:06.150
What for?

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:07.440
Sit.

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.370
Sit for a while. Let's chat.

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:13.920
Why did you come out too?

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:16.360
Feels suffocating.

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:18.300
Suffocating in there, wasn't it?

00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:20.000
Just admit it—

00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:21.960
Tiecheng doesn't welcome you.

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.990
How about we go to the Fujian
hometown association gathering?

00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:26.920
Wait. Where are you actually from?

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.230
When I'm with Tiecheng folks,
I'm from Tiecheng.

00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:31.690
When I'm with Fujian folks,
I'm from Fujian.

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:34.280
So you came to the gatherings

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:35.810
really just to sell things?

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.760
What else?

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:39.930
I'm studying finance.

00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:41.480
I run a small business

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:43.410
and try to get some clients.

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:44.670
Many of them are my clients.

00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:46.810
Aren't you embarrassed if you get caught?

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:48.750
What's there to be embarrassed about?

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:50.230
As the saying goes,

00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:52.320
the thick-skinned get their fill,

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:54.150
while the thin-skinned starve.

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:57.180
You didn't get any just now, did you?

00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:58.590
I'll take you to Cafeteria No. 2.

00:42:58.590 --> 00:42:59.230
My treat.

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:00.320
I... I'll pass.

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:01.320
I really have things to do.

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:02.320
I still have some things to handle.
