=I Only Believed You'd Love Me=

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:50.960
Why...

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.840
Why?

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.950
Ying Du,

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.840
it really was you.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.510
Why?

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.510
Why would you do this?

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.130
Zhaoli,

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.280
from the moment I learned
you were the Saintess,

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.310
I knew this was the fate set for us.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.350
You should never have fallen for me.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.680
I never once believed in that fate.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.200
I only believed you'd never hurt me

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.280
and you'd be kind to my grandmother

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.840
because you loved me.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.280
Now, your heart holds resentment.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.920
That's how it should be.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.640
Ying Du!

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.600
Grandmother.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.760
It was my fault.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.310
I should've trusted your words.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.950
If I had believed you,

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.560
you wouldn't have died, Grandmother.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.040
No one else would have died.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.000
I was wrong.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.840
It was all my fault.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.590
Ying Du,

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.470
I'll take his life myself.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.630
I'll kill him with my own hands.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.470
Grandmother,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.520
I'll surely avenge you.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.280
(I heard that girls)

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.190
(tend to adore such little trinkets.)

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.360
(I suppose Zhaoli would like them too.)

00:03:30.616 --> 00:03:32.000
I hadn't even gone looking for you,

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.590
yet you came to me on your own.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.960
It was you who used Ye Li

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.470
to strike against Zhaoli, wasn't it?

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.840
Right.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.870
Ye Li's obsessive love for you

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.470
is the sharpest blade
I can wield over her.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.520
You're too dangerous

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.840
for Zhaoli.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.190
I'll rid her of this threat.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.710
Why aren't you resisting?

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:13.630
Because

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.840
my goal is already achieved.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:25.790
Zhaoli.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.560
Che.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.110
Zhaoli,

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.240
do not trust him again.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.760
Che!

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.310
Let me go!

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.070
You killed Che.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.630
You'd kill me

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.000
for him?

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.320
Yes.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.950
That's the Saintess's power.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.920
You can't heal on your own.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.520
Zhaoli,

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.120
why are you treating me this way?

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.360
You've never looked at me
like that before.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.950
I hate you!

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.630
You killed Che!

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.270
You killed Grandmother!

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.260
Zhaoli, it wasn't me.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.440
Ying Du,

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.510
if I hadn't gone looking
for the Bracelet

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.160
or made that deal with Ye Li,

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.680
I never would've met you.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:51.560
If I hadn't met you,

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.410
Grandmother and Che

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:53.593
might still be alive and well.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.510
All of this was my fault.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.480
I've failed them!

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.520
Zhaoli!

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:06.880
- As expected,
- Zhaoli.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.000
we still couldn't escape...

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.720
We couldn't escape

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.270
our fate.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.520
This.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.360
This little trinket.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.240
Do you like it?

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:27.670
Zhaoli.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.240
Your grandmother

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.920
guards you most in this world.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.360
How could I ever harm her?

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.510
As long as you stay with me,

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.240
I'll do anything you ask.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.070
If it were possible,

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:41.800
I wish

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.160
that we'd never

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:49.870
meet again.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:02.350
No!

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:04.480
Zhaoli!

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.000
Zhaoli!

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:11.590
Zhaoli.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.440
Ying Du,

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.190
in the end, I'm the one who won.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.950
The time has come.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:24.950
Once she's gone,

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.870
your journey ends as well.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.270
I'll take over your body

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.630
and become the new Ying Du.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:34.710
Zhaoli,

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.480
I won't let you die.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.400
He...

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.160
He's channeling all his power

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.190
to awaken the Bracelet
and turn back time.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:10.560
He's risking his life!

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:25.590
