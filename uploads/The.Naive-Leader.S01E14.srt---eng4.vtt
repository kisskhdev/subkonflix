WEBVTT

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.400
I, Fan Pengju, have returned!

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.560
He's back! He's back! He's back!

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.120
Fan Pengju.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.560
Don't... don't be so arrogant.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.040
You're back, fine, you're back.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.840
But... but you brought so many bandits.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.350
Don't open your mouth just to spout nonsense.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:04.870
Up until now,

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.350
have I touched you at all?

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.120
Have you ever seen

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.120
such reasonable bandits?

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.200
You just haven't started robbing us yet.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.280
You made such a big scene.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.000
Is it just for show?

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.310
It's to tell you clearly

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.190
who calls the shots now.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.080
Elders,

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.870
Simpleton didn't collude with bandits before,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.240
and he isn't a bandit now.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.430
They are the Brotherhood, who are above the law.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.590
They surely won't do anything to harm everyone.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.840
Yu Zhen.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.280
These few here...

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.120
ganged up to bury me alive.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.710
I'm the bigger man,

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.910
so I won't hold it against them.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.030
On the contrary,

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.400
I've come to protect you.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.840
You?

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.960
Protect us how?

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.840
If you don't cry "stop thief" while being the thief,

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.120
or steal from your own, that's good enough.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.960
I won't rob you.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.910
There are plenty of people who want to rob you.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.240
As long as you provide some money and grain regularly,

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.080
I will keep you safe.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.430
To put it plainly,

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.750
you just want to take money

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.400
out of us common folks' pockets.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.960
Wrong.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.360
The common folks are suffering right now.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.800
Even bandits feel bad robbing them.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.280
What do they want to rob?

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.280
They want to rob you lot who are fat with wealth.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.560
You're the shrewd one.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.960
You want both fame and fortune.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.030
I'm taking your money to ward off disaster for you.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.750
This... this probably isn't up to you.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.120
We have the local militia.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.520
Your local militia?

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.470
Do they have as many men as I do?

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.430
Do they have as many guns as I do?

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.120
Old Master! Old Master! Old Master!

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.960
Why are you shouting in such a panic?

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.680
The Young Master is back!

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.150
The Young Master is back!

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.360
Are you dreaming?

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.080
Now,

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.910
I can't hide it from you anymore.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.400
To tell you the truth,

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.520
the Young Master never died.

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.470
I knew from the very beginning

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.150
that he was alive all along.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.720
Whose kid is this?

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.120
He looks quite sturdy.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.510
I'm from the Qian family.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.000
What are you doing?

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.160
What?

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.000
Is the lollipop tasty?

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.680
It's tasty.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.240
Tell your grandpa to give some money

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.160
for those other kids

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.000
to buy some too, okay?

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.830
Okay. We have money at home.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:51.680
See that?

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.240
Even the kid is so sensible.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.190
As a grandpa, set an example.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.560
And the rest of you,

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.160
hand it over.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.390
Set an example too.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.360
Come on, hurry up.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:07.270
Take it out.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.000
Are you dismissing a beggar?

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.480
This is money to save your lives.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.070
Yes.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.510
I... I didn't bring enough money today.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:15.750
I... I'll go back and get it later.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.430
Make way, make way, make way

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.390
Hurry, make way, make way

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:33.480
Make way, make way

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.160
Granduncle

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:38.390
Granduncle

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.160
Granduncle

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.920
Stand up

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:43.510
Kneel down

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.870
You unfilial son

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.560
Buried alive for colluding with bandits, yet unrepentant

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.190
Now you've gone and become a bandit yourself

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.000
I am not a bandit

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.510
In front of so many people

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.000
You kidnapped someone's child

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.720
How is that any different from what bandits do?

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.430
It is even worse than them

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.480
I did it to help more children

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.160
You think you're the King of Heaven?

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:12.160
What is it?

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.680
In front of all these people

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.750
I still need to save face

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.430
You think it's like before?

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.000
You can hit me whenever you want?

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.000
You... your wings have hardened

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.000
I am working on the redistribution of wealth

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.070
You wouldn't understand

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.160
Every family's property

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.310
Isn't it accumulated by generations of ancestors

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.680
Through hard labor?

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.600
It doesn't just fall from the sky

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.870
You've read too many books at home

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.360
What is happening out there

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.070
You don't understand at all

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.310
For the poor to turn their lives around now

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:55.870
It is basically impossible

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.430
Do a little business

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.000
And get exploited by local ruffians

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.000
If the business gets big

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.390
The government loots you

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.240
These... my brothers here

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.160
Only went up the mountain because they were too poor and miserable

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.920
Then what about these old masters?

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:19.630
How did they offend you?

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.240
They have a lot of money

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.310
Take it out for everyone to use

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.830
Use it together?

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.240
A disgrace to the Fan family

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.000
I failed to teach you properly

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.120
I have failed everyone

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.240
Disband your men immediately

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.120
And come back with me

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.000
I will give everyone an explanation

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.120
Explain what? What explanation?

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.190
Since I was little

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.480
You've always controlled me

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:47.630
You never supported me

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:48.800
Now I...

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.830
Have brothers and guns

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.560
I want to call the shots myself

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.630
You call the shots?

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.000
If you don't go back today

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:01.480
Then don't ever go back in this lifetime

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:05.600
I didn't want to go back anyway

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:07.870
You...

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.920
Young Master, what are you doing?

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:25.630
Simpleton!

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.750
Simpleton!

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:30.920
Old Master! Old Master!

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:31.560
Granduncle.

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:32.360
Old Master!

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:37.360
To produce such a disgrace...

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:39.120
And even set up a spirit tablet for him!

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.600
I... Even if the Fan family line ends with me...

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.750
I will strike his name from the genealogy!

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.840
Go to hell!

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:48.870
Old Master!

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:49.870
Easy, easy, Old Master.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.320
Easy, easy, Old Master.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.720
Old Master! Old Master! Old Master!

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.200
Help! The Old Master has fainted!

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.960
Quick, someone come! Help!

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.000
Rich folks, halt!

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:01.630
Pay up.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.000
Toll fee.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:03.840
Search, search, search.

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:05.480
What are you hiding from?

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.150
What on earth is this?

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.480
Halt!

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.790
Got any grain at home?

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:13.320
Got any money?

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:14.600
Grain.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:15.440
Not bad.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:17.120
Take this.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.120
This is for you.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:18.750
Go.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.320
Thank you!

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.000
Go, go, go.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:21.080
Open the gate!

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:22.670
Come, Yu Zhen.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.150
You have a bowl too.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.600
Are you trying to anger Granduncle to death?

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.150
I can't reason with him.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.240
The things I'm doing now...

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.790
He just doesn't understand.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.440
Isn't that clearly...

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.870
Cutting ties with him?

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:39.600
Those old fogies...

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.960
Never looked me in the eye once.

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:43.870
You don't want your man...

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.630
To never amount to anything.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:48.080
You have to support me.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:50.000
Brother Fan.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.240
I support you.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.720
But you really shouldn't have used the child.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.720
Brother Fan would never hurt a child.

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:00.550
Eat up.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:01.600
It's not poisoned.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.080
Eat up.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.240
If you don't eat, I'll beat you!

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.720
You're so used to being a bandit...

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.670
You've forgotten how to be a good person?

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.150
Let me do it.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.390
Sister Yu Zhen.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:16.030
Brother Fan definitely wouldn't...

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.840
Do anything wicked.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.080
Sometimes extreme measures are normal.

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:22.080
It's the Jianghu, unavoidable.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.080
You just need to trust Brother Fan.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.080
Supporting him is the right thing to do.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.440
Are we good people?

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:42.630
See that?

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:43.960
Keep feeding him.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:44.960
Come on.

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:48.390
Eat, come on.

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:50.120
Come eat. Good boy.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.510
Men at birth...

00:10:55.630 --> 00:11:00.440
Are naturally good.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.630
I'll write it down.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.080
You must remember this.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.320
Okay.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:26.910
Right.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.910
Come on! Come on! Come on!

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:30.870
Harder! Harder!

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:34.480
Okay, good, good, good. Come on.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.030
That's enough. That's enough.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.870
That chubby little brother who looked after you before...

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.840
You really couldn't find him?

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:50.030
We couldn't.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.870
We looked everywhere we could.

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:56.120
Don't move!

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:00.510
What are you all doing?

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.550
I'm teaching you to read.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.440
I'm teaching them combat.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.600
Learning this stuff at such a young age?

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.510
Reading is useful.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.790
Learning this is more useful.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.510
In this day and age...

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.270
I want to teach them from a young age...

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:17.910
...how to protect themselves.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:22.150
I want to learn this! I don't want to study!

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.630
When you grow up...

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.270
...do you all want to become bandits?

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.320
If we can be as dashing as Big Brother Fan...

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:28.510
...then I want to be a bandit too!

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:29.390
When I grow up...

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:31.840
...I want to roam the Jianghu with Big Brother Fan.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.270
Good, good, good.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.440
But let me make one thing clear.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.550
We are not bandits.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.440
We are the Brotherhood that robs the rich to aid the poor.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.150
It's all the same!

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.000
It's all the same!

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.550
We just want to follow Big Brother Fan!

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:45.000
I want to follow Big Brother Fan too!

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:46.750
Alright, alright, follow me.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.480
Go out and practice.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:57.630
The little ones just think it's fun.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:59.320
Don't take it to heart.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.080
Learning these things so young...

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.550
...is it really useful?

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:05.390
Sister Yu Zhen.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.510
Not every child...

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:10.270
...has someone to care for and look after them.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:12.360
And certainly not every child...

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.790
...is as lucky as you are.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.750
To have a father who is a teacher...

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:19.720
...and a man like Big Brother Fan.

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:23.120
They can only rely on themselves.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:26.000
Only by learning these things...

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:27.870
...can they take good care of themselves...

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.240
...and not get bullied.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.870
Give us that gun!

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:33.000
Give the gun to me!

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.600
Come on, give us the gun!

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.750
Give us the gun!

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:57.510
Doctor Niu, thank you.

00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:58.510
You're too kind, too kind.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.360
It's just ahead, not far now.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.080
It's right there.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:06.390
When I found him...

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:08.320
...he was already stone cold dead.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:10.550
I've brought you here, so I'll be going now.

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:12.440
Don't say I brought you here.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.670
And definitely don't say you know me.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:16.510
You...

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:18.390
...even though you treat cows...

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:19.360
...but...

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:20.910
...you cured me.

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:22.750
You're my lifesaver.

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:23.630
And now...

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.630
...you've buried Xiu Gu's father.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.750
I must reward you handsomely.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:29.960
No, no, no.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.870
No need, no need, no need.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:33.960
If... if...

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.840
I'll be stuck in this mess like a cat in sticky rice.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.240
They'll say I'm colluding with bandits.

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:40.440
If I tell you to take it, just take it!

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.390
Seriously...

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:42.960
Who dares to run their mouth?

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:44.320
I'll deal with them.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:45.320
Take it.

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:50.000
You can go now.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:03.910
Lao Dong

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:06.510
You

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:08.390
saved my life.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.750
And you died saving Yu Zhen.

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:17.360
Without you, we wouldn't be here.

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:20.360
Your kindness...

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.840
we must repay it.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.840
When you were alive...

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:31.270
you worried most about Xiu Gu.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.270
You worried about her future marriage.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.630
Now she is...

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:43.750
all alone and helpless.

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.600
Miserable...

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:49.670
and solitary.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:54.910
And Yu Zhen won't say where she stands.

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:57.360
Lao Dong...

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:00.480
what am I supposed to do?

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:02.480
I agree.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:08.630
Lao Dong!

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:11.790
Yu Zhen has agreed!

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:12.840
Come.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:14.790
The three of us...

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:16.750
will kowtow to Father.

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:32.360
Lao Dong...

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.200
for your death...

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.150
I will make sure justice is served.

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:38.200
Bad news!

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.270
Bad news! Bad news!

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.440
Why the panic?

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:42.910
That Fan guy and Xiu Gu...

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:44.120
are here with a bunch of bandits!

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:46.960
We were just looking for him.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.600
Now he's delivered himself to our doorstep.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:49.790
They brought guns, too!

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:52.720
Young Master, perhaps you should hide for now.

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:53.790
Why should I hide?

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:55.600
Would he dare touch me?

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.600
Dong the Drunkard died at our hands.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.030
A desperate dog will jump a wall.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.600
A cornered rabbit will bite.

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.790
Go, go notify Regiment Commander Qin.

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:05.510
Yes.

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:06.670
Use the back door.

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:14.550
Come on!

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:18.590
Get the weapons!

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:39.550
Don't move! Don't move!

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:46.750
Put them down! Put them down!

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:52.350
Come here! Squat down!

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:54.070
Keep a low profile.

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:55.680
Don't shoot.

00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:59.200
Tell Huo to come out!

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:00.240
How dare you!

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:01.880
Our Young Master...

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.960
isn't someone you can see just because you want to.

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:10.790
Search the place!

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:11.720
Yes!

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.270
I won't make things hard for the servants.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.640
Every debt has its debtor.

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:25.920
I'm only after the ringleader who bullies people.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.590
You smug villain.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.920
This isn't a place for you to throw your weight around.

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:46.270
Boss, no one's here.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:47.960
He must have run away.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.640
So Huo abandoned you lot?

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.440
I hate disloyal people like that.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.510
What a joke.

00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:00.070
Our Young Master knows when to yield to circumstances.

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:03.310
A life for a life.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.550
Then come at me.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:20.310
I was the one who tied you up.

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:22.720
Young Mistress Fan...

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.590
was also detained by me.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:27.550
And your old man...

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:29.720
was killed by me.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.350
It has nothing to do with our Young Master.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.550
The Huo family has shown me kindness for two generations.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.070
This life...

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:41.510
I will pay with it.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:53.480
Do it, then.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.790
Since you're a man of honor...

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:03.720
I'll grant your wish.

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:06.070
I'll send you on your way.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:58.590
Brothers

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:00.270
Hurry up, let's go

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.640
The soldiers will be chasing us soon

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.830
Xiu Gu, take this one

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:07.350
Young Master Huo is the real culprit

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.400
I don't need you to remind me

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:09.920
I won't let him off either

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.270
Let's go

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:14.480
Yu Zhen, sit here

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:15.590
I don't want to sit

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.240
Then I'll walk with you

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:23.200
What's wrong with you?

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:28.590
Simpleton

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:30.750
I feel like

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.000
I barely recognize you anymore

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.830
I don't even recognize myself

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:37.400
Lately

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.240
I've changed so fast

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.680
All these things

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.070
it's like I was born knowing them

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:45.400
I didn't even have to learn

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:48.070
It all comes so naturally to me

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:50.960
You mean killing and arson?

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.310
Does that come naturally to you?

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:56.640
I meant upholding justice

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.480
You actually think you're doing good deeds?

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.110
You've been so sarcastic lately

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:08.960
What's the matter?

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:17.880
You are not my Simpleton anymore

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:20.310
I'm not your Simpleton

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:22.270
then whose Simpleton am I?

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.440
I used to think

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:28.480
it was just my lack of experience

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.160
not understanding the dangers of your Jianghu

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:35.310
But my Simpleton

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.310
wouldn't be so cruel to Granduncle

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:39.550
beating people on a whim

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.310
nor would he teach children to be delinquents

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.240
"I'm here to send you on your way"

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:46.510
nor would he take a life

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.550
or burn down people's houses

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.400
In your eyes

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.070
am I really that bad?

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:56.270
Didn't you see the good things I did?

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.680
I adopted those homeless children

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:02.160
I repay kindness with kindness

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:04.440
Did you not see any of that?

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.640
But you can't lose your conscience

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.240
and become so ruthless

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.270
You didn't see how they treated me

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:12.750
If you don't believe me, ask Xiu Gu

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:15.960
Why can't you be like

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.240
Xiu Gu and support me?

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.720
I haven't been like Xiu Gu

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.880
going through so much with you

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:23.790
But I also don't think

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.310
that what Xiu Gu does is for your own good

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.070
What?

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:32.160
Big Brother

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.880
I wasn't eavesdropping

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:34.880
I was guarding the rear

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:35.680
Look

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.270
they've gone far ahead

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:38.350
You two didn't catch up

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:39.640
As your armed guard

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.880
I have to protect you closely

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.070
Go, go, go

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:45.510
You two keep arguing

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:46.510
I'll wait for you over there

00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:59.160
Simpleton

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.720
come back with me

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:04.920
I can't go back

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:06.510
And I don't want to go back

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:08.960
Then let's find a small town to settle down

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:11.400
Live a quiet, peaceful life

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:12.680
Okay?

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:15.480
My ambition

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.400
is to roam the Jianghu

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.590
Now that so many brothers follow me

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.070
and they do it willingly

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:25.550
It wasn't easy to get where I am

00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:27.550
I want to achieve things

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.400
I want to do big things

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.000
You just

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:36.680
can't accept it yet

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:40.960
There's still plenty of time

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:43.510
Slowly

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:47.790
you will understand me

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:09.440
Division Commander Chen

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:11.960
Division Commander Chen

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:13.240
What is it?

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:14.480
Division Commander Chen

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:17.440
Division Commander Chen! Help me! Division Commander Chen!

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.000
Why is it you again?

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:20.160
It's the bandits!

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.680
Those bandits are trying to wipe me out!

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.070
Did you step on a bandit's tail?

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.720
For them to target you everywhere?

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.400
Before, because of the cargo matter,

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.110
I asked you, Division Commander Chen, to help suppress the bandits, right?

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.160
Who knew they were so cunning?

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.510
They managed to get away.

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:34.790
So...

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.400
Now they've come to take revenge on me.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.030
Why is the version I heard different?

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.880
That girl's father...

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.400
Seems to have died at your hands.

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:47.750
He...

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:50.350
That was my butler, a momentary slip-up.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.830
Besides...

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:53.830
He was colluding with bandits!

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.790
He deserved to die!

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:58.440
Then what did you run here for?

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.070
Division Commander Chen.

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:03.400
I've decided.

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:05.110
I want to give up business and join the army.

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:07.640
Nowadays bandits are rampant.

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:09.310
I wish to serve under your banner, Division Commander Chen.

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:11.550
To help you suppress the bandits.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.510
You want to join the barracks?

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:15.310
Go report to the recruitment office.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.000
You're joking, Division Commander Chen.

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:20.720
I am a scholar.

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:22.960
I'm afraid I can't carry a gun.

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.240
Division Commander Chen.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.880
This is my entire fortune.

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:34.480
I hand it to you to expand your armaments.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.240
If you don't mind, Commander...

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:49.160
Let me see.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.750
Move Two to Six.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.590
Remove Four and Eight.

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:29.920
Sacrifice a piece to take the lead.

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:32.350
That's interesting.

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:33.590
Commander.

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:36.310
This game of black and white pieces...

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.640
Is just like two armies facing off.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.880
I, Huo, have read a few books on military strategy.

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:44.640
I know well that Zhuge Liang's brilliant plans...

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.680
Can defeat a million mighty soldiers.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.270
No matter how fierce Lu Bu was...

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:50.590
He still met his end at White Gate Tower.

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:55.240
You could let me try being a Staff Officer.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Thank you, Commander.

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.030
From now on...

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.270
I am a piece on your chessboard, Commander.

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:01.240
Wherever you point...

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.070
I will strike there.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.680
To offer advice and strategy for you...

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.830
I will not hesitate.

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:16.790
Staff Officer Huo.

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.000
Please.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.920
Thank you, thank you.

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:24.200
That I have this day...

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.790
Is entirely due to the trust of my brothers.

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:29.920
Is entirely because you brothers backed me up.

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:32.830
Drink more wine.

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:34.830
We'll eat meat in a bit.

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:36.510
Alright!

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:38.400
Cheers!

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:39.200
Brother Fan

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:40.400
To be honest,

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:41.880
I really don't see

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:42.960
what charm you have

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.510
to win over two women.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.270
You wouldn't understand that.

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:47.920
A woman's perspective and a man's

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:48.920
are different.

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:49.880
Women can see things

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.160
that we men cannot.

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:53.720
My wife...

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:55.640
saw I was the chosen one.

00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:57.110
As for Xiu Gu,

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.550
sometimes she's like a brother,

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.270
sometimes like a sister.

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:03.200
Anyway, it's different.

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:04.790
Different is good.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.750
If they were the same, why get two?

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:09.110
Most importantly,

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.640
how did you convince the first wife

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.110
to let you take a second one?

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.110
I'm just lucky.

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:16.270
I found one who is understanding,

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.030
and then found another understanding one.

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.510
I wonder when we

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:22.790
will have such good fortune.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.310
You will, you will. Always.

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:26.030
Everyone will have this good fortune.

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:27.400
Come on.

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.790
Cheers! Cheers!

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:48.830
I live at the Yangtze's source,

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.720
and you at the Yangtze's end.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.750
Day after day I think of you but cannot see you,

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:00.350
though we drink from the same river.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.750
When will this water cease to flow?

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:08.830
When will this sorrow end?

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:12.400
I only wish your heart is like mine,

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:17.510
and never betrays my longing.

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:29.200
They are all drinking.

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:33.160
I came to watch the sunset with you.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:45.830
Yu Zhen.

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:49.070
They say you have the air of a matriarch.

00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:56.510
Simpleton.

00:30:57.510 --> 00:30:58.310
I'm leaving.

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.440
I married Fan Pengju,

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:05.750
not a bandit chief.

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.270
Although you keep denying you're a bandit,

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.790
in the eyes of the world,

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:14.160
there is no difference.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.510
You have your lofty ambitions,

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:20.310
and I have principles I stick to.

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:22.400
I know

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:24.880
you are sincere to me.

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:27.640
And I, to you,

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.000
am also sincere.

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:33.270
But I can't be like you,

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.160
nor can I stop you.

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:39.310
We walk different paths.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.070
I don't want to make things hard for you.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:44.720
Do not worry about me.

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.400
