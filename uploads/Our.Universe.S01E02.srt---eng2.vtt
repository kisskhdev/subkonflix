Do you really have to turn me
into some kind of burden?

00:04:29.045 --> 00:04:30.297
How are you a burden?

00:04:30.297 --> 00:04:31.381
I am.

00:04:31.381 --> 00:04:33.633
Like this thing stuck to you,
weighing you down.

Hyun Jin.

00:04:34.926 --> 00:04:37.579
You already have your hands full with Woo Joo,

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.623
and you still went out of your way
to make a room for me here.

00:04:42.767 --> 00:04:44.127
I'm never moving into this house.

00:04:44.978 --> 00:04:46.462
So please...

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:49.340

If only they'd sent it a few days earlier...

Then I wouldn't have fought with my sister...

I wouldn't have said
those awful things to her...

Am I a burden to you?

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:41.076
- Who said that?
- You did.

You haven't even tied the knot

00:05:43.161 --> 00:05:44.788
and you've spent your whole life
looking after me.

as the chief mourner for Sun Woo Jin.

00:08:21.986 --> 00:08:23.846
He was apparently such a good person

right there at the funeral.

- Don't do it there...

- No.
- Hold on tight.

Hey.

00:14:47.371 --> 00:14:49.624
Seriously, how are you planning
to do this by yourself?

00:14:49.624 --> 00:14:51.042
Will you actually be fine?

00:14:51.042 --> 00:14:53.961
I was only here for a bit
and I'm already drained.

00:14:53.961 --> 00:14:55.463
I'll manage.

00:14:55.463 --> 00:14:57.006
Things should get better

00:14:57.006 --> 00:14:59.884
once my arm's healed up.

00:14:59.884 --> 00:15:00.968
So

00:15:00.968 --> 00:15:02.970
that Pimang jerk who did this to your arm

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:04.330
hasn't even called?

00:15:07.183 --> 00:15:08.601
No conscience,

00:15:08.601 --> 00:15:09.811
no sense of responsibility.

00:15:09.811 --> 00:15:11.270
Whatever, screw him.

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:12.605
Woo Joo and I will get by

00:15:12.605 --> 00:15:14.190
perfectly fine without him.

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:16.926
He's probably off
living his best life somewhere.

00:15:22.052 --> 00:15:23.825
So this is the look I want for the kitchen,

00:15:23.825 --> 00:15:26.035
and this is for the living room.

00:15:26.035 --> 00:15:28.371
And over here,

00:15:28.371 --> 00:15:30.915
I need the outlets
completely flush with the wall.

00:15:30.915 --> 00:15:34.126
This is where the TV and soundbar will go,

00:15:34.126 --> 00:15:34.836
so I need a quad outlet.

00:15:34.836 --> 00:15:38.214
That's really not an easy job.

00:15:38.214 --> 00:15:41.509
Once the TV goes up, you won't even see it.

00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:43.636
I can't wrap my head around

00:15:43.636 --> 00:15:44.720
doing recessed work

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.180
in a place this old...

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.516
They said it's possible
if you open up the floor.

00:15:48.516 --> 00:15:49.934
I absolutely need

00:15:49.934 --> 00:15:52.019
everything to look clean inside.

00:15:52.019 --> 00:15:53.771
Well if you're such an expert,

00:15:53.771 --> 00:15:55.523
do it yourself then.

00:15:55.523 --> 00:15:58.442
If I tear up the floor like you're suggesting

00:15:58.442 --> 00:16:00.027
and accidentally hit the plumbing,

00:16:00.027 --> 00:16:01.612
we're looking at a flood.

00:16:01.612 --> 00:16:03.823
And if this unit and the one downstairs both
get water damage,

00:16:03.823 --> 00:16:05.074
are you going to cover that?

00:16:05.074 --> 00:16:06.492
That's exactly

00:16:06.492 --> 00:16:08.452
why I'm spending money

00:16:08.452 --> 00:16:11.438
to hire someone with your expertise.

00:16:12.832 --> 00:16:15.376
I'm already giving you a deal,

00:16:15.376 --> 00:16:16.752
a huge deal,

00:16:16.752 --> 00:16:17.879
actually the biggest deal possible,

00:16:17.879 --> 00:16:21.591
but you keep piling on requests

00:16:21.591 --> 00:16:23.467
and I can't make any progress.

00:16:23.467 --> 00:16:25.761
I'm begging you here.

00:16:25.761 --> 00:16:28.055
We need this done right
so we can start on the floors

00:16:28.055 --> 00:16:29.599
and tiles,

00:16:29.599 --> 00:16:32.339
and actually move in on time.

00:16:42.382 --> 00:16:43.926
Oh my, look at the veins on his hands.

00:16:49.368 --> 00:16:50.602
Gosh.

00:16:57.043 --> 00:16:58.819
His knife skills are amazing.

00:17:23.298 --> 00:17:24.403
What do we have here!

00:17:24.403 --> 00:17:26.656
The bok choy salad has a bolder seasoning,

00:17:26.656 --> 00:17:28.366
tailored for single folks.

00:17:28.366 --> 00:17:29.909
For the wild chive greens
doenjang tofu pancake,

00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:32.119
I let the fragrance do the heavy lifting.

00:17:32.119 --> 00:17:33.663
And this one's

00:17:33.663 --> 00:17:35.147
purely for show.

00:17:36.916 --> 00:17:39.943
Let me try some.

00:17:43.798 --> 00:17:45.202
Of course.

00:17:46.008 --> 00:17:48.135
The cafeteria is empty because everyone's off

00:17:48.135 --> 00:17:49.679
to taste your cooking here.

00:17:49.679 --> 00:17:50.930
This crowd is double

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:53.057
what we had at the "Today's Meal" launch.

00:17:53.057 --> 00:17:57.144
Team 3 has topped sales
three consecutive times now.

00:17:57.144 --> 00:17:59.939
We couldn't have done it
without the directors backing us.

00:17:59.939 --> 00:18:02.942
Order volume has already
tripled our original goal,

00:18:02.942 --> 00:18:06.595
so we're still on
for that production line expansion, correct?

00:18:07.446 --> 00:18:09.031
And Director Kim,

00:18:09.031 --> 00:18:11.659
you're aware we've got
another project in development, right?

00:18:11.659 --> 00:18:14.245
How many projects are you running at once?

00:18:14.245 --> 00:18:14.954
Doesn't that wear you out?

00:18:14.954 --> 00:18:17.707
If you all greenlight things quickly,
it's really no problem.

00:18:17.707 --> 00:18:19.542
I'll have the proposal to you

00:18:19.542 --> 00:18:21.544
by three this afternoon then.

00:18:21.544 --> 00:18:23.590
There you go again.

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:27.076
With you delivering winners back to back,

00:18:27.076 --> 00:18:29.969
how come you keep having vacancies?

00:18:29.969 --> 00:18:31.637
That's why we're hiring someone new soon.

00:18:31.637 --> 00:18:33.080
Yeah.

00:18:38.936 --> 00:18:40.479
Mr. Park.

00:18:40.479 --> 00:18:42.440
Was the whole vein display

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.216
really necessary though?

00:18:45.317 --> 00:18:48.137
I mean, I was impressed too.

00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:53.506
How'd you lock down
the production line expansion on the spot,

00:18:53.506 --> 00:18:56.770
plus get the green light
for the new product so effortlessly...

00:18:59.248 --> 00:19:02.365
Was all that showmanship intentional?

00:19:02.365 --> 00:19:03.911
You plan with your head,

00:19:03.911 --> 00:19:06.155
but you persuade with your body.

00:19:07.047 --> 00:19:08.049
Excuse me?

00:19:08.049 --> 00:19:10.426
One cooking demo beats a hundred meetings.

00:19:10.426 --> 00:19:11.969
They never

00:19:11.969 --> 00:19:13.662
look at the actual documents anyway.

00:19:15.306 --> 00:19:16.766

00:19:16.766 --> 00:19:19.042
- Nice work.
- Great work.

Alright, thanks.

Yeah.

Or should I ask my mom for help?

No.

00:41:34.989 --> 00:41:36.032
Actually, going back
to the first family meeting...

00:41:36.032 --> 00:41:36.950
No, all the way back to Pimang...

00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:38.184
No!

00:41:40.008 --> 00:41:42.327
I swear on my life

00:41:44.290 --> 00:41:46.275
I will never deal with her again.

00:41:50.463 --> 00:41:51.547
My precious babies.

00:41:51.547 --> 00:41:52.887
I'm going to keep my babies safe.

00:41:52.887 --> 00:41:55.051
Any chance I could stay
one more month in the studio...

00:41:55.051 --> 00:41:57.387
The next tenant already signed.

00:41:57.387 --> 00:41:59.305
[Storage service]
My piece measures 800 millimeters across.

00:41:59.305 --> 00:42:00.932
You'd have to book immediately,

00:42:00.932 --> 00:42:01.724
but the wait list is pretty long.

00:42:01.724 --> 00:42:03.685
This is a tiny studio apartment.
I can't fit furniture like a sofa in here.

00:42:03.685 --> 00:42:05.566
Didn't you always say
your home would never betray you?

00:42:05.566 --> 00:42:07.009
Guess it betrayed you?

00:42:18.908 --> 00:42:20.743
All right.

00:42:20.743 --> 00:42:22.704
Keep coming.

Keep coming.

Keep coming.

Keep coming.

Okay, this way, this way.

Not that way,

this way!

Oh my, hey...

Oh my, the peppers, the peppers!

00:42:39.721 --> 00:42:41.139
Stop, stop.

00:42:41.139 --> 00:42:42.849
Whoa, seriously,

00:42:42.849 --> 00:42:45.000
you're driving all over the peppers!

00:42:49.272 --> 00:42:51.482
These peppers are so plump and good.

00:42:51.482 --> 00:42:52.842
Whoa, seriously.

00:42:53.581 --> 00:42:54.610
What's going on?

00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:56.362
Why did you come out here?

00:42:56.362 --> 00:42:57.590
Is someone moving in?

00:42:57.590 --> 00:42:58.656
Which floor are they going to?

00:42:58.656 --> 00:43:00.408
You know...

00:43:00.408 --> 00:43:01.951
As far as I know,

00:43:01.951 --> 00:43:04.579
nobody left this morning...

00:43:04.579 --> 00:43:07.123
Mom, they destroyed your peppers.

00:43:07.123 --> 00:43:09.024
Oh my, what am I going to do?

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:12.003
Seems like we have a new neighbor.

00:43:12.003 --> 00:43:13.254
Yeah.

00:43:13.254 --> 00:43:16.174
Oh my, look at you! Here is our Summer...

00:43:16.174 --> 00:43:17.592
and here is Spring...

and little Autumn is here too!

It's Daddy.

00:43:21.721 --> 00:43:23.056
Hey, Lee Jae Min.

00:43:23.056 --> 00:43:24.515
Shouldn't you be out on a delivery?

00:43:24.515 --> 00:43:26.208
You checking crypto again?

00:43:35.234 --> 00:43:36.486
Excuse me,

00:43:36.486 --> 00:43:38.071
which unit are you heading to?

00:43:38.071 --> 00:43:40.615
Okay, go to unit 206.

00:43:40.615 --> 00:43:41.891
206?

00:43:54.524 --> 00:43:56.050
Hi, Woo Joo!

00:44:04.125 --> 00:44:06.294
- Just drop everything in the living room.
- Yes.

00:44:06.294 --> 00:44:07.962
Hold on,

00:44:07.962 --> 00:44:09.839
what's happening here?

00:44:09.839 --> 00:44:12.366
The baby's aunt.

00:44:13.134 --> 00:44:16.178
You said I'm incredibly dependable.

00:44:16.178 --> 00:44:17.888
You're super responsible.

00:44:17.888 --> 00:44:20.558
And the baby and I have incredible chemistry.

00:44:20.558 --> 00:44:22.310
And you and Woo Joo have amazing chemistry.

00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:25.062
And you mentioned you'd like

00:44:25.062 --> 00:44:26.981
to raise the baby here with me.

00:44:26.981 --> 00:44:28.774
To be honest, if you don't mind,

00:44:28.774 --> 00:44:31.343
I'd love to raise Woo Joo here
with you anytime.

00:44:34.363 --> 00:44:35.698
So you don't actually mean

00:44:35.698 --> 00:44:37.766
you're moving in, do you?

00:44:38.784 --> 00:44:41.329
Sure, this is Woo Joo's place,

00:44:41.329 --> 00:44:42.663
but...

00:44:42.663 --> 00:44:44.415
I'm already living here.

00:44:44.415 --> 00:44:46.066
And why is that an issue?

00:44:46.751 --> 00:44:47.943
We've

00:44:55.885 --> 00:44:57.058
already

00:44:57.970 --> 00:44:59.204
stripped

00:45:00.598 --> 00:45:01.915
down together.

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:05.127
We've already stripped together.

00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:07.104
Going forward,

00:45:07.104 --> 00:45:08.422

I appreciate

00:45:15.279 --> 00:45:16.805
your cooperation.

00:45:21.952 --> 00:45:24.622
Cooperation for what?

00:45:24.622 --> 00:45:25.790
How does any of this make sense?

00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:28.793

Then,

00:45:30.836 --> 00:45:34.548
do you have 5.36 million won?

00:45:34.548 --> 00:45:36.217
5.36 million won?

00:45:36.217 --> 00:45:38.452
- What are you talking about?
- Damage compensation.

00:45:40.846 --> 00:45:42.217
This is the scene of the incident

00:45:42.217 --> 00:45:43.766
from the day

00:45:43.766 --> 00:45:45.286
you left the baby with me and disappeared.

On that exact day

when you left for your interview,

00:45:48.793 --> 00:45:49.814
this is the tragic evidence

[Marble repair, one million won]
of all the damage I suffered.

00:45:52.547 --> 00:45:55.094
If you're still not convinced,

00:45:55.897 --> 00:45:57.154
here's more from that same day.

00:45:57.154 --> 00:46:01.450
On that exact day
when you went to your interview,

00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:03.327
thanks to the phone

00:46:03.327 --> 00:46:04.829
Woo Joo wrecked,

00:46:04.829 --> 00:46:06.789
I missed the contractor payment
and the critical window,

00:46:06.789 --> 00:46:08.833
which led to a complete catastrophe.

00:46:08.833 --> 00:46:10.918
As a result, my move-in

00:46:10.918 --> 00:46:12.569
was delayed by a full month.

00:46:13.337 --> 00:46:15.423
The bill for all of this

00:46:15.423 --> 00:46:18.575
is exactly 5.36 million won.

00:46:22.596 --> 00:46:23.876
Wait,

00:46:23.876 --> 00:46:25.423
you're not seriously

00:46:25.423 --> 00:46:28.688
telling me you plan to stay here, are you?

00:46:28.688 --> 00:46:30.229
This is simply temporary shelter

00:46:30.229 --> 00:46:31.964
for myself and my babies.

00:46:34.859 --> 00:46:36.527
But strictly speaking,

00:46:36.527 --> 00:46:38.529
we're not even related,

00:46:38.529 --> 00:46:40.114
and beyond that,

00:46:40.114 --> 00:46:42.516
you're a man and I'm a woman.

00:46:43.826 --> 00:46:45.411
Hang on,

00:46:45.411 --> 00:46:47.062
do you actually view me as a man?

00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:50.624
Of course not.

00:46:50.624 --> 00:46:53.068
You're so not my type.

00:46:54.879 --> 00:46:57.256
The feeling is mutual.

00:46:57.256 --> 00:46:58.883
You're simply Woo Joo's aunt to me,

00:46:58.883 --> 00:47:01.010
that's all you are.

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:02.011
Then it's settled,

00:47:02.011 --> 00:47:04.538
we can live together just fine.

00:47:05.649 --> 00:47:08.635
No, this still isn't okay.

00:47:08.635 --> 00:47:09.994
Wait, hold on.

00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:13.153
Why am I seeking approval from you

00:47:13.153 --> 00:47:16.066
when someone else actually owns this place?

00:47:16.066 --> 00:47:18.040
By your own logic,

00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:19.753
the owner here isn't you,

00:47:19.753 --> 00:47:21.763
it's Woo Joo.

00:47:26.327 --> 00:47:27.912
When I think about it,

00:47:27.912 --> 00:47:30.080
at the funeral, Woo Joo was
the true chief mourner.

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:31.899
Which means Woo Joo is also the true owner.

00:47:32.833 --> 00:47:34.794
So, what's your take?

00:47:34.794 --> 00:47:36.921
Can I be your tenant?

00:47:36.921 --> 00:47:38.380
Huh?

00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:39.489
Yes.

00:47:40.841 --> 00:47:42.676
Sure.

00:47:42.676 --> 00:47:44.077
See? He said yes.

00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:51.668
Ta-da.

00:48:39.291 --> 00:48:40.901
At your service, Master.

00:48:44.488 --> 00:48:45.948
Woo Joo, what's in your mouth?

00:48:45.948 --> 00:48:47.449
Please tell me that's not chocolate.

00:48:47.449 --> 00:48:48.993
For breakfast today we have

organic rice, locally grown cabbage,

00:48:52.329 --> 00:48:53.539
and Korean carrots.

00:48:53.539 --> 00:48:54.928
Need me to continue?

00:48:58.633 --> 00:48:59.837
It's excellent for longevity.

00:48:59.837 --> 00:49:01.154
This is decaf.

Woo Hyun Jin.

00:50:35.057 --> 00:50:36.792

I got the BS job!

00:50:52.989 --> 00:50:55.035
Oh, congrats.

00:50:55.035 --> 00:50:56.245
Woo Joo, clap.

00:50:56.245 --> 00:50:57.079
Clap.

00:50:57.079 --> 00:50:58.831
Give your auntie a "thumbs up".

00:50:58.831 --> 00:51:00.797
That's right.

You know,

rather than hanging around here,

00:51:03.002 --> 00:51:04.753
why not go out with your friends?

00:51:04.753 --> 00:51:06.296
Step outside, breathe some fresh air,

00:51:06.296 --> 00:51:07.739
treat yourself to something tasty.

00:51:08.465 --> 00:51:10.175
Pick up some outfits for work.

00:51:10.175 --> 00:51:12.953
Don't worry about Woo Joo or the house.

00:51:14.263 --> 00:51:15.872
Say bye, Auntie's going out.

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:23.046
Woo Joo, I'll be back.

00:51:26.379 --> 00:51:27.401
Does this make any sense?

00:51:27.401 --> 00:51:30.654
He's a man, I'm a woman,

00:51:30.654 --> 00:51:32.031
how can we live together?

00:51:32.031 --> 00:51:33.323
Men and women should keep their distance.

00:51:33.323 --> 00:51:35.308
Nobody's asking you to share a bed with him.

00:51:35.915 --> 00:51:36.952
Why wouldn't you though?

00:51:36.952 --> 00:51:39.246
Just be housemates, nothing more.

00:51:39.246 --> 00:51:40.706
Honestly, I see no problem with it.

00:51:40.706 --> 00:51:42.875
If anything, it's beneficial.

00:51:42.875 --> 00:51:44.168
With childcare and chores,

00:51:44.168 --> 00:51:46.086
you can divide it all evenly.

00:51:46.086 --> 00:51:47.321
Evenly?

00:51:52.426 --> 00:51:53.635
Not a chance.

00:51:53.635 --> 00:51:55.054
Absolutely not.

00:51:55.054 --> 00:51:56.680
Yesterday he stormed in

00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:59.332
and I got caught off guard,

00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:02.061
but tonight I will

00:52:02.061 --> 00:52:03.312
definitely kick that man out.

If I just stay on that woman's good side,

I can save on rent and storage,

00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:23.248
It's freezing.

00:52:23.248 --> 00:52:25.209
Not a servant, it's called strategy.

00:52:25.209 --> 00:52:27.336
It's pure paternal devotion to my babies.

00:52:28.295 --> 00:52:29.588
After those repair costs,

00:52:29.588 --> 00:52:31.590
my account's down to 153,000 won,

00:52:31.590 --> 00:52:33.467
and the loan payment is due soon.

00:52:33.467 --> 00:52:34.968
But you know how things between men and women

00:52:34.968 --> 00:52:36.453
can get complicated.

00:52:37.179 --> 00:52:38.347
What if you end up

00:52:38.347 --> 00:52:39.723
catching feelings for her?

00:52:39.723 --> 00:52:41.642
Catch feelings? Not in a million years.

00:52:41.642 --> 00:52:44.353
But that woman seemed
really set on getting rid of you.

00:52:44.353 --> 00:52:46.236
What if she doesn't back down?

00:52:46.236 --> 00:52:48.190
Not going to happen.

00:52:48.190 --> 00:52:50.943
Even fate is working in my favor.

00:52:50.943 --> 00:52:52.260
She...

00:52:53.612 --> 00:52:55.096
landed a job.

00:53:06.291 --> 00:53:07.417
Hyun Jin.

00:53:07.417 --> 00:53:08.710
You're not buying anything?

00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:10.546
Let me buy you something to celebrate your job.

00:53:10.546 --> 00:53:12.756
No, I already have enough clothes.

00:53:12.756 --> 00:53:15.092
What are you reading?

00:53:15.092 --> 00:53:17.953
I've got to find childcare for Woo Joo,

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.997
but nannies cost over 2 million won.

00:53:21.646 --> 00:53:23.642
And daycares are all backed up...

00:53:23.642 --> 00:53:24.935
Gosh.

00:53:24.935 --> 00:53:27.963
Adapting to our company at first
is going to be really demanding.

00:53:28.689 --> 00:53:30.065
Exactly.

00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:32.109
Woo Joo and I are both

00:53:32.109 --> 00:53:34.511
going to need time to settle in.

00:53:38.574 --> 00:53:40.242
You think that woman

00:53:40.242 --> 00:53:42.536
will actually follow your grand plan?

00:53:42.536 --> 00:53:43.704
Just wait and see.

00:53:43.704 --> 00:53:47.082
She'll reach out to me
in less than ten minutes.

00:53:47.082 --> 00:53:48.250
Ten minutes.

00:53:48.250 --> 00:53:51.634
Tick tock tick tock...

00:53:51.634 --> 00:53:52.713
Just consider that guy

00:53:52.713 --> 00:53:54.256
a short-term assistant.

00:53:54.256 --> 00:53:56.216
Hire him, use him, endure him.

00:53:56.216 --> 00:53:58.218
You hold all the power anyway.

00:53:58.218 --> 00:53:59.928
Still, something about it feels wrong.

00:53:59.928 --> 00:54:01.638
Hyun Jin.

00:54:01.638 --> 00:54:05.601
Suppress that old-fashioned mindset of yours.

00:54:05.601 --> 00:54:07.419
Just think about what benefits you now.

00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:12.382
All right.

00:54:15.152 --> 00:54:16.862
I got a message.

00:54:16.862 --> 00:54:20.032
There's something pressing we should sort out,

00:54:20.032 --> 00:54:21.909
don't you think?

00:54:21.909 --> 00:54:24.269
Let's talk in the living room at seven tonight.

00:54:28.332 --> 00:54:29.458
One month.

00:54:29.458 --> 00:54:32.628
Exactly one month, no longer.

00:54:32.628 --> 00:54:33.795
Let's do nine to six.

00:54:33.795 --> 00:54:35.005
During my hours at BS,

00:54:35.005 --> 00:54:37.324
I need you to look after Woo Joo completely.

00:54:38.431 --> 00:54:39.468
Agreed.

00:54:39.468 --> 00:54:42.262
And keep the apartment tidy while you're at it.

00:54:42.262 --> 00:54:44.765
Just maintain things like you have been.

00:54:44.765 --> 00:54:45.766
Auntie.

00:54:45.766 --> 00:54:47.083
Yeah.

00:54:49.228 --> 00:54:50.646
Okay.

00:54:50.646 --> 00:54:52.356
But it's fifty-fifty.

00:54:52.356 --> 00:54:55.425
In good conscience, as co-residents.

00:54:56.181 --> 00:54:57.319
Agreed.

00:54:57.319 --> 00:54:58.862
Water, gas, electric,

00:54:58.862 --> 00:55:00.113
wifi included,

00:55:00.113 --> 00:55:01.848
all split in half.

00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:08.163
Done.

00:55:08.163 --> 00:55:10.624
And since Woo Joo technically owns this place,

00:55:10.624 --> 00:55:12.751
his diapers and formula

00:55:12.751 --> 00:55:14.194
are also split evenly.

00:55:15.545 --> 00:55:16.946
Fine, agreed.

00:55:18.048 --> 00:55:19.597
Agreed.

00:55:19.597 --> 00:55:20.849
[Roommate Agreement]

00:56:22.759 --> 00:56:23.761
Pimang?

00:56:23.761 --> 00:56:24.927
Looks like something's on it.

00:56:24.927 --> 00:56:26.532
No, forget it. Don't buy it.

00:56:27.206 --> 00:56:28.261
Pimang guy?

00:56:28.261 --> 00:56:30.777
So you really are Woo Jin's brother?

00:56:30.777 --> 00:56:32.289
- One random day,
- One random day,

00:56:32.289 --> 00:56:34.052
- another "universe"
- another "universe"

00:56:34.052 --> 00:56:35.469
- suddenly dropped into it.
- suddenly dropped into it.

00:56:35.469 --> 00:56:36.469
Mommy.

00:56:36.469 --> 00:56:39.672
What am I supposed to do with the baby?

00:56:39.672 --> 00:56:42.386
We need to decide which of you will raise him.

00:56:42.386 --> 00:56:44.093
What? You smiling?

00:56:44.093 --> 00:56:45.386
This is not the time to smile.

00:56:45.386 --> 00:56:46.706
Read the room.

00:56:48.264 --> 00:56:50.487
Why did you...

00:56:50.487 --> 00:56:51.767
Why did you just leave the baby with me?

00:56:51.767 --> 00:56:52.810
I'll raise him.

00:56:52.810 --> 00:56:54.927
I'll take care of Woo Joo.

00:56:54.927 --> 00:56:56.535
Will you actually be fine?

00:56:57.386 --> 00:56:58.678
Woo Joo and I will get by

00:56:58.678 --> 00:57:00.286
perfectly fine without him.

00:57:00.969 --> 00:57:02.528
Look at this place...

00:57:02.528 --> 00:57:04.446
Seriously, how are you planning
to do this by yourself?

00:57:04.446 --> 00:57:05.511
I have to get in

00:57:05.511 --> 00:57:08.350
so I can raise Woo Joo right.

00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:13.302
Your place is flooded right now.

00:57:13.302 --> 00:57:15.761
So when will I be able to move in?

00:57:15.761 --> 00:57:18.127
At least another month.

00:57:18.127 --> 00:57:20.136
Hold on, what's happening here?

00:57:20.136 --> 00:57:22.803
So you don't actually mean
you're moving in, do you?

00:57:22.803 --> 00:57:25.302
Just consider that guy a short-term assistant.

00:57:25.302 --> 00:57:27.719
With childcare and chores,
you can divide it all evenly.

00:57:27.719 --> 00:57:28.469
One month.

00:57:28.469 --> 00:57:30.678
I need you to look after Woo Joo completely.

00:57:30.678 --> 00:57:32.017
Done.

00:57:32.017 --> 00:57:33.052
Agreed.

00:57:33.052 --> 00:57:35.702
I appreciate your cooperation.

00:57:38.530 --> 00:57:39.929
Make sure you knock

00:57:40.572 --> 00:57:41.905
when you need me.

00:57:41.905 --> 00:57:43.574
Hold on, you don't have work?

00:57:43.574 --> 00:57:45.905
How can you look after Woo Joo
while I'm at work?

00:57:45.905 --> 00:57:48.281
You're so useless.

00:57:48.281 --> 00:57:51.156
Just until I find my footing at the company.

00:57:51.156 --> 00:57:54.072
Hello, I'm Park Yoon Seong,
manager of Planning Team 3.

00:57:54.072 --> 00:57:57.947
I really wanted Yoon Seong
to only see me at my best.

00:57:57.947 --> 00:57:59.215
- Let me have it.
- No way.

00:57:59.215 --> 00:58:01.384
What if you end up falling for that woman?

00:58:01.384 --> 00:58:02.905
No, Woo Joo.

00:58:02.905 --> 00:58:04.245
No!

00:58:04.947 --> 00:58:07.039
Oh crap.
