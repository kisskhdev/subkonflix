WEBVTT

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.580
Natsume-san's omelet is so delicious.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:12.580
And the coffee you made too.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.070
Ever since Emma's training ended yesterday,

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.170
Toma has been acting

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.390
a little strange.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.920
Is he okay?
Emma's personal training...

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.330
Natsume-san...

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.100
I love you.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.520
So suddenly... what's wrong?

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.240
I just suddenly wanted to say it...

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.720
Maybe it's not just

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.430
that he's tired.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.950
What is this feeling...?

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.280
Natsume-san.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.560
Aren't you eating?

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.420
Oh, no, I am.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.209
You too, hurry up and eat.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.040
There are still tomatoes left.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:59.790
Alright, alright.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.070
I'll eat them.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.840
I hope I'm just overthinking.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.300
"Cosmetic Playlover" Season 2
(Episode 2)

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.320
This weekend is the launch day
for our new summer foundation.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.446
It's our product that we have the
most confidence in this season.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.060
Please understand the customers'
skin concerns and distribute samples.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.080
Please do your best to promote it.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.310
Yes!

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.320
Also, sales for the new
lipstick are doing well.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.690
Please continue your
efforts in that area too.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.110
And,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.270
I have a meeting at headquarters today.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.060
Aizawa-san,

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.590
while I'm away,

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.090
I'll leave things to you.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.160
Understood.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.870
Now, let's all work
hard with a smile today!

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.630
Thank you for your hard work.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.780
While the interpretation
of the concept is good,

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.690
it doesn't fully highlight the
positives of the bone structure.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.500
Also, pay more attention
to the lighting conditions.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:58.730
Yes.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.740
Atsushi's base makeup is really well done.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.470
And the color scheme is excellent.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.150
It's very pleasing to the eye.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.790
I just followed the basics.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:16.530
Oh dear.

00:03:16.531 --> 00:03:17.949
Having personal
characteristics is a good thing.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:18.970
Here we go again.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.890
Well, this is fine for me.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.640
Something important...?

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.030
Actually, I want to make you...

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.506
(Emma Lauren Makeup Artist Training
Workshop Location: Conference Room A)

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.020
Toma must be

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.650
working hard right now too.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.500
I need to do my best too.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:13.970
Mamiya-kun?

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.680
Huh?

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.640
- Oh, long time no see.
- Long time no see.

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.620
You're looking well.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.290
You as well, Chief Harada.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.700
I'm not the chief any longer,

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.710
you are.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.260
Oh, right... I just got
used to calling you that.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.120
I heard you're working hard as a chief.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:34.690
Thank you.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.560
What are you doing now that
you're back at headquarters?

00:04:38.733 --> 00:04:40.293
I'm in the training department.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.340
To become a full-fledged trainer,

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.600
I'm learning every day.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:46.880
A trainer, huh...

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.280
Is it completely different from a BA's job?

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.610
Perhaps it's the same in essence.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.970
What a trainer needs to have is

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.820
a personality that genuinely
rejoices in others' growth,

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.280
and a convincing authority.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.190
Also,

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.050
a passion for the brand, I suppose.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.700
Ah, now that you mention it,

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.960
you actually possess all of that.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.780
Huh? Me?

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.130
In June,

00:05:13.131 --> 00:05:17.460
the new recruits that we're training might be sent
to your department, so please take care of them.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.640
I'll be counting on you then.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.340
Yes, of course, no problem.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:33.810
Hello?

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.606
I figured your meeting would be over
by now, and you'd be on your way home.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:38.630
Huh...

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.510
You're not secretly watching
me somewhere again, are you?

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.630
Because I'm on a break right now.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.200
I see.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:48.820
Will you be late again today?

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.420
Probably.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.840
Natsume-san, you should go to bed first.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.110
I can wait for you.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.410
Being waited for actually stresses me out.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.730
I might even sneak out
of training halfway through.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.180
You can't do that.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:02.870
I understand.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.060
I'll go to bed first.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:05.790
Okay.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.020
Natsume-san.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:09.580
Hmm?

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.260
Tell me to do my best.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.400
Okay.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.680
Do your best.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.340
Alright, I'll do my best.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.490
Ah, I should get going.

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.030
- See you then.
- Mm.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.570
I'm full.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:01.180
It'll probably be like this
until the workshop ends.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.350
Even though we live together.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.360
No, no, no.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.830
Don't, don't, don't.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.930
He's working hard too.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.440
I also need to

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.040
do what I can.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.730
Alright, um...

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:57.390
I'm home.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.560
Natsume-san...

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.110
Good morning.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:55.570
Morning.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:57.410
Huh?

00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:59.186
Toma, are you going to
the workshop again today?

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:00.210
Yes.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.410
Natsume-san, you have
the day off today, right?

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:03.470
Yeah.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.950
Then I should get going.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:08.620
Wait.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.840
It's your day off, you
could actually rest at home.

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.900
It's fine, I'll walk with
you part of the way.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:18.980
You want to be with me that much?

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.100
Huh?

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:21.590
Ah, no... um...

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:23.780
well what if I did, then so what?

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.340
No, I'm happy too.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.280
But, I can go by myself from here.

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:31.930
Okay.

00:09:31.955 --> 00:09:32.955
I understand.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:34.510
Do your best.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.080
Okay, I'm leaving.

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:37.630
Mm.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:46.710
Natsume!

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:51.950
- Emma-san?
- You're just in time.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.340
So, Natsume, what do you think?

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.600
About Toma taking the next step?

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.260
I'm very happy.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.800
It also makes me feel
like I need to work harder.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.870
It's a great motivation for me.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.600
I see.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.660
As I said last time,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.300
I also sensed his potential.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.620
That's why this time,

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:23.050
I made thorough preparations like this,

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:24.970
looking forward to meeting him.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.760
Preparations?

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.250
I heard from Nanjo-kun

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.530
how to deal with that charmless Toma.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.650
Nanjo-san?

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.420
He said the only way was
to bring up Natsume's name.

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:45.199
The moment your name was mentioned,

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.060
his eyes really changed, it startled me.

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:50.029
But thanks to that,

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.850
he finally got on track obediently.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:55.970
I'm really sorry for using you.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.700
Um... what do you
mean, Emma-san?

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:06.820
I have something important to tell you.

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:09.820
Something important...?

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:13.030
Actually, I'm considering

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:18.430
making you one of my successors.

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:24.030
Successor?

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:25.970
A top makeup artist?

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:27.050
That guy?

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.830
It's not like a promotion.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:37.230
It's just a testing phase for promising stars
to see if they can be key training candidates.

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:40.060
Why him?

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.030
You see, makeup artists

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:52.130
all want to express themselves.

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:56.580
For example, Nanjo-kun is that type.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:00.630
He wants to show originality in his makeup.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.410
He's an artist at heart.

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.000
That's not a bad thing in itself.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:09.940
However,

00:12:09.941 --> 00:12:12.950
it's not suitable for becoming a
top figure who symbolizes the brand.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.650
Consistently embodying the brand's colors,

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.830
and protecting the brand image,

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.020
these are the necessary
conditions for a top figure.

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:26.589
Toma, in a good way,

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:28.230
doesn't have strong personal preferences.

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:30.029
Rather than the artistry of makeup,

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:32.620
he's more interested in
structure and technique.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.060
He can reliably absorb what's incomplete,

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.600
and flexibly adapt to corrections.

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:43.160
On top of that, the individuality he
displays is also very well-balanced.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:45.539
This type of person

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.750
is very valuable to a brand.

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:52.699
Those who want to cherish their own style

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.530
often feel that the brand is a constraint,

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:57.380
so many don't stay long.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:58.840
Morning.

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:00.310
Good morning.

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:03.810
Sahashi-kun, morning.

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:06.740
Hello.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.970
Do your best today too.

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:13.510
There are countless people

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:15.260
with better skills than Toma.

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:17.540
However,

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.920
I feel he has potential worth training.

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:22.530
That's how I feel.

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:25.390
Emma-san.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.500
Are you seriously considering him as...

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.190
You can ask him about the rest yourself.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.900
What he'll do next is up to him.

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:35.550
Understood.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.120
In any case,

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.679
you're not the only one who's happy

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.430
about Toma's growth.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:43.740
So, Natsume, you do your best too.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.749
I'm sure you two will influence each other

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:49.090
and grow together.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.040
Okay.

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:52.290
I understand.

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:56.710
The atmosphere got too serious, didn't it?

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.260
Alright, have a cup of
coffee before you go.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.450
Have a pleasant holiday.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:04.900
Ah.

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.110
Thank you for the hospitality.

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:13.010
Toma...

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.750
wants to be Emma-san's successor...

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:19.160
So that's why he...

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.020
Natsume-san.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.820
I love you.

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:25.680
I just wanted to stay with you

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:28.220
like this for a little longer.

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:32.020
I had a feeling he was acting strange then.

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:38.860
The days I can personally
train you all like this

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.370
are numbered.

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:43.410
Everything I've taught you,

00:14:43.435 --> 00:14:44.955
make sure you absorb it well.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.320
Allons-y.

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:48.670
Yes!

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.360
Excuse me.

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:17.290
You're home.

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:19.050
I'm home.

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:22.570
Did something happen?

00:15:22.594 --> 00:15:23.794
Huh...

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:25.610
Oh, no.

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:26.770
Nothing happened.

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:29.360
By the way, have you had dinner?

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:30.420
Yes, I have.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:33.070
You must be tired, go take a bath.

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:37.250
Before that...

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:39.960
Can I talk to you for a bit?

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.320
Uh...

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.400
OK.

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:48.550
Natsume-san.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:51.960
Actually, I...

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:56.100
Emma asked me if I
wanted to aim for the top.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:58.860
Hmm...

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:00.950
I heard from Emma-san.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.120
Huh?

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.040
Is that so?

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:07.419
After I saw you off this morning,

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:08.640
I happened to run into her.

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:12.680
Why did she have to say anything?

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:15.430
But that's all I heard.

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:20.640
He told me to hear it directly from
you how you decide to proceed.

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.020
I see.

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:25.530
Mm.

00:16:32.609 --> 00:16:33.800
All this time,

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:36.470
while working diligently,

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:41.217
I've always made decisions with only one
thing in mind: to stay by Natsume-san's side.

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:45.030
That hasn't changed even now.

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:48.610
It's just...

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.980
Feelings and the future...

00:16:53.376 --> 00:16:54.956
which one should I prioritize?

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:57.050
That's what I'm thinking about.

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:00.410
Feelings and the future...

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:08.610
I don't aspire to become like
Emma, the pinnacle of Romy.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:15.580
I want to become the top makeup artist at
Romy Japan, right where you are.

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:24.590
I want to become someone
Natsume-san can be proud of,

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:29.020
as well as considering my
feelings after Emma's training,

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:35.030
That's the conclusion I came to after
considering both of those things.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:37.090
Toma...

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:40.060
However...

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:42.050
to achieve this goal,

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:44.860
I must join Emma's team

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.510
and learn from them.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.760
After personally experiencing
the techniques of a top team,

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:53.340
I feel like it would be difficult to
hone the same kinds of skills in Japan.

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.320
So that means...

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:03.680
You're going to Paris to study with Emma?

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.060
Not immediately, it's a future plan.

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:12.910
How long will you be gone?

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:18.680
Emma said at least two years.

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:23.730
I see.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.160
I...

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:37.770
I can't go to Paris with you.

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:43.180
Because I also have...

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:47.140
a dream of continuing to grow as a BA.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:51.320
But,

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:55.730
I will support the path you choose.

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.090
If you want to go to Paris to study,

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.390
I will support you.

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:07.350
I won't hold you back.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.000
But...

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:16.150
That means we'll be in a
long-distance relationship, right?

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.730
I still can't do it.
I can't be separated from you.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.520
I'll wither and die.

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:27.140
Wither and die?

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.330
You're exaggerating too much.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.760
Do your best.

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:35.090
I'll always be by your side.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.470
If I only consider my feelings,

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:50.340
I can't even imagine
being separated from you.

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:54.700
But,

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.150
considering the future,

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.410
I don't want to stagnate.

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:07.080
Because I hope that from
now on, I can always...

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:11.960
achieve all sorts
of dreams with you.

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:17.340
I didn't expect him to be
troubled to this extent...

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:22.630
So confused and lost...

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:25.830
Hey, Toma.

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:31.370
Don't think about me
first, just think carefully.

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:40.260
I'm not going anywhere.

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:43.840
And I believe in you.

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:46.060
And I'll support you.

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:49.410
So,

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.760
you need to think about
what you truly want to do.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:01.200
Do you want to go and learn from Emma-san,

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:02.950
or not?

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:05.130
There are only these two options.

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:07.450
It's simple, right?

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:10.000
Natsume-san...

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:14.500
The feeling of 'wanting to be together'

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.920
and the feeling of 'wanting
to work hard at makeup'

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.760
are both equally strong.

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:23.470
That's why you're hesitating so much.

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:28.290
In that case,

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:33.090
in the past, you gave me
so much support at work.

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:37.070
This time, it's my turn to...

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:39.850
support you.

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:42.710
That's all it is, right?

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:53.000
Natsume-san, you...

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:56.090
are truly a strong person.

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:03.650
I'm not strong at all.

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.600
My feelings are the same as yours.

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:12.870
But,

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:16.050
seeing you...

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:22.660
with this incredibly cool dream of 'wanting
to reach the top', I'm truly happy.

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:27.490
I will definitely support you.

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.720
You really are strong.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.620
Am I?

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:48.710
I respect you very much.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:52.720
I love you the most.

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:56.780
Mm.

00:22:58.570 --> 00:22:59.670
It's the first time I've...

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:02.470
heard Toma's dream so clearly.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.280
He said as long as I cheer him on,

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.250
he can keep working hard.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.440
So,

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:13.210
I will keep telling him,

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:17.030
so that you can achieve your dream,

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.470
this time, it's my turn to...

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.420
support you.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.160
Well then,

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:30.630
my training course ends today.

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:35.140
Please continue to strive to
improve your skills from now on.

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:36.700
Good work, everyone.

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:38.580
Thank you very much.

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:55.840
Emma...

00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:57.870
Toma.

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:00.290
Yesterday...

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.230
I talked to Natsume-san.

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:05.870
And what did Natsume say?

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:08.700
He said, 'Go for it.'

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:11.100
I see...

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:14.870
In that case,

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:16.870
regarding the assignment to Paris,

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:18.430
I'll officially start processing it.

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:21.530
Okay.

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:23.860
Thank you so much.

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:34.490
Thank you for coming.

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:41.030
Customers haven't stopped
coming since noon today.

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:42.780
We're truly grateful to everyone.

00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:45.990
Pre-orders for the new
foundation are quite high too.

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:48.800
The texture is really amazing, isn't it?

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:51.740
Pre-orders for the summer
collection will also start next week.

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:53.430
Let's all do our best together!

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:54.740
Yes!

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:57.060
- I'll send the data to headquarters first.
- Okay.

00:24:58.550 --> 00:24:59.550
Welcome.

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:01.330
Welcome.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.000
Excuse me, I'd like to see some lipsticks.

00:25:04.566 --> 00:25:07.566
Certainly, these are this season's
new arrivals. Would you like to try them?

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:13.940
Paris, huh...

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:18.700
Emma said at least two years.

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:25.100
Can I really handle a long-distance
relationship with him for two years...?

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:27.650
No, no.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:28.960
I need to pull myself together.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:32.070
I also need to aim to become the best BA.

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:36.630
Huh?

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:38.750
But,

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:41.790
what exactly is a 'great BA'?

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.096
(Next Episode)
It can't be helped that it turned out that way.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.459
The real thing is the best.

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:53.649
Even though he's just a new BA,
he seems quite troubled.

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:55.190
What does it feel like

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.820
to love your job?
