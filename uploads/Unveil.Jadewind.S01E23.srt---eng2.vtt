{\an8}ADAPTED FROM A SHUQI.COM NOVEL
ORIGINAL AUTHOR: SENLIN LU

00:01:34.105 --> 00:01:35.185
And the sentence?

00:01:35.265 --> 00:01:36.105
Strangling.

00:01:36.185 --> 00:01:38.345
Steal something valuable
or serious enough,

00:01:38.425 --> 00:01:39.265
and your clan

00:01:39.345 --> 00:01:40.425
gets dragged in.

00:01:42.225 --> 00:01:44.305
- How many clans?
- At least three.

00:01:44.385 --> 00:01:46.665
If it's worse, nine.

00:01:49.705 --> 00:01:50.945
Are these seeds valuable?

00:01:52.025 --> 00:01:52.865
Priceless.

00:01:54.625 --> 00:01:56.305
- Then sentence him at once.
- Understood.

00:01:57.905 --> 00:01:59.265
Please have mercy, Your Ladyship.

00:02:00.105 --> 00:02:01.385
Even if I must die,

00:02:01.905 --> 00:02:04.065
can I at least take the ginseng seeds home

00:02:04.985 --> 00:02:06.385
to save my son?

00:02:09.905 --> 00:02:10.744
Explain.

00:02:16.385 --> 00:02:17.545
My young boy

00:02:19.265 --> 00:02:20.825
has always been frail

00:02:21.585 --> 00:02:22.985
and takes medicine all year round.

00:02:23.065 --> 00:02:26.025
A few months ago,
he developed another strange disease

00:02:26.745 --> 00:02:28.225
and was aching to the bones.

00:02:28.305 --> 00:02:30.065
But in the vast Western Capital,

00:02:30.145 --> 00:02:32.145
nobody was able to cure him.

00:02:32.225 --> 00:02:34.985
One day, a traveling physician

00:02:35.065 --> 00:02:36.545
said he had a folk remedy for it.

00:02:36.625 --> 00:02:40.025
{\an8}But the prescription
contains an essential ingredient,

00:02:41.065 --> 00:02:42.225
the ginseng seeds.

00:02:43.185 --> 00:02:45.265
Those are exclusively for the royal family

00:02:45.345 --> 00:02:46.985
and hard to obtain for commoners.

00:02:47.065 --> 00:02:48.785
I tried everything

00:02:48.865 --> 00:02:51.265
and spent a fortune on the black market,
only to get two pieces.

00:02:55.265 --> 00:02:56.865
Fortunately, the prescription worked.

00:02:56.945 --> 00:02:59.985
My son took the medicine and slept soundly

00:03:00.065 --> 00:03:02.065
without crying at all.

00:03:03.265 --> 00:03:04.905
But he wasn't cured.

00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:06.345
So we couldn't stop the medicine.

00:03:06.425 --> 00:03:09.585
Once we stopped it,
he ached all over again.

00:03:13.505 --> 00:03:15.345
It's alright.

00:03:17.545 --> 00:03:20.905
We needed
two ginseng seeds every seven days.

00:03:21.425 --> 00:03:24.945
They are expensive and hard to obtain,
even with a fortune.

00:03:25.025 --> 00:03:26.665
Even those who are well-connected
in the black market

00:03:26.745 --> 00:03:28.505
can't get so many of those.

00:03:31.185 --> 00:03:34.585
Even if it's to save your son,
you can't steal from the palace.

00:03:34.665 --> 00:03:36.425
I-I didn't steal anything.

00:03:36.505 --> 00:03:39.105
H-How would I even have
the chance to steal those?

00:03:39.905 --> 00:03:41.105
The…

00:03:43.105 --> 00:03:44.705
The deity gave them to me.

00:03:45.345 --> 00:03:46.185
Deity?

00:03:52.505 --> 00:03:53.505
Your Ladyship.

00:03:54.665 --> 00:03:56.545
Do you believe in deities?

00:04:00.985 --> 00:04:03.305
WORSHIPPING A FALSE DEITY

00:04:04.185 --> 00:04:06.945
I watched my son
suffer from illness every day

00:04:07.945 --> 00:04:09.585
and my wife grow skinnier.

00:04:11.545 --> 00:04:14.265
I could do nothing
but drown my sorrows in liquor,

00:04:15.425 --> 00:04:16.465
right up until the night

00:04:17.064 --> 00:04:18.345
I was on duty in the palace.

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:21.425
I got drunk and had a dream.

00:04:55.185 --> 00:04:56.425
Later, I realized

00:04:57.305 --> 00:04:58.785
that it wasn't a dream.

00:04:59.665 --> 00:05:01.265
White Asura is back for real.

00:05:01.985 --> 00:05:03.505
My son could be saved.

00:05:06.905 --> 00:05:07.865
What utter nonsense.

00:05:07.945 --> 00:05:09.505
How dare you lie to Her Ladyship?

00:05:09.585 --> 00:05:11.385
Are you asking for a beating?

00:05:21.705 --> 00:05:24.465
You said that White Asura is back.

00:05:27.185 --> 00:05:28.025
Yes.

00:05:28.665 --> 00:05:30.985
They showed up and left?

00:05:31.905 --> 00:05:32.785
That's right.

00:05:33.665 --> 00:05:34.625
I lack the fortune

00:05:34.705 --> 00:05:37.265
to have followed them
from the very beginning.

00:05:39.985 --> 00:05:42.705
I don't know when he showed up.

00:05:43.305 --> 00:05:45.905
But I know
that they vanished two years ago.

00:05:49.785 --> 00:05:50.865
That's right.

00:05:50.945 --> 00:05:52.105
Two or three years ago,

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:54.105
whispers spread through the palace

00:05:54.705 --> 00:05:57.265
that White Asura averted disasters
and cured illnesses.

00:05:57.345 --> 00:06:00.065
But those rumors circulated
only among the eunuchs and palace maids.

00:06:00.665 --> 00:06:02.705
The palace handles
such matters with great caution.

00:06:02.785 --> 00:06:04.905
Inspector Du was worried about witchcraft

00:06:04.985 --> 00:06:06.585
or gathering people to plot something
and looked into it,

00:06:06.665 --> 00:06:09.385
only to find that the so-called believers

00:06:09.465 --> 00:06:11.985
mostly received some favor
purely by chance.

00:06:12.065 --> 00:06:13.625
There was nothing shady.

00:06:13.705 --> 00:06:15.945
Nor had there been any trouble.

00:06:16.025 --> 00:06:18.705
So he told us to keep an eye on it
just in case trouble arises.

00:06:19.785 --> 00:06:22.025
What you said rings a bell.

00:06:22.105 --> 00:06:24.945
There are often rumors in the palace

00:06:25.545 --> 00:06:26.385
about deities and spirits.

00:06:26.465 --> 00:06:28.025
In the end, they all went away,

00:06:28.105 --> 00:06:30.105
soon replaced by new rumors.

00:06:30.785 --> 00:06:32.625
Only half a year later,

00:06:32.705 --> 00:06:34.585
no one spoke of White Asura again.

00:06:34.665 --> 00:06:36.065
White Asura is real.

00:06:36.585 --> 00:06:39.025
White Asura is real.

00:06:39.105 --> 00:06:40.905
As long as you are devoted,

00:06:40.985 --> 00:06:43.105
they will grant you w-whatever you want.

00:06:43.705 --> 00:06:46.545
How do you know
they're the one who helped you?

00:06:47.825 --> 00:06:49.785
They manifested in my dreams

00:06:50.705 --> 00:06:52.145
and told me I'd get

00:06:52.945 --> 00:06:54.145
what I wanted

00:06:55.185 --> 00:06:56.465
in a few days.

00:06:58.265 --> 00:07:00.825
Two ginseng seeds lasted for seven days.

00:07:01.345 --> 00:07:02.225
What happened next?

00:07:04.625 --> 00:07:07.225
Did White Asura tell you
to dig Brilliant Lady Dou's magnolia

00:07:07.305 --> 00:07:08.585
by the Penglai Pool?

00:07:12.665 --> 00:07:14.145
The medicine was ending.

00:07:17.025 --> 00:07:18.585
I grew anxious.

00:07:18.665 --> 00:07:21.025
I didn't know if White Asura
would appear again.

00:07:21.785 --> 00:07:23.465
Thankfully, they were compassionate.

00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:25.025
That night,

00:07:25.705 --> 00:07:28.145
they manifested in my dream again.

00:07:28.225 --> 00:07:31.745
They told me to wait
at the Penglai Pool the next day.

00:07:32.345 --> 00:07:34.545
Then, I would be guided

00:07:34.625 --> 00:07:35.625
to the ginseng seeds.

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:37.825
I went to the Penglai Pool the next day

00:07:38.425 --> 00:07:39.945
and went around it.

00:07:41.745 --> 00:07:43.345
I was quite flustered,

00:07:43.865 --> 00:07:46.985
wondering how they would
give me instructions in broad daylight.

00:07:48.265 --> 00:07:49.585
Then I heard the call

00:07:49.665 --> 00:07:51.345
of a most unusual bird.

00:07:51.945 --> 00:07:54.665
I looked up and instantly spotted

00:07:55.185 --> 00:07:57.745
that beautiful and dazzling white parrot.

00:07:57.825 --> 00:07:58.665
I knew

00:07:58.745 --> 00:08:00.985
that must be the instruction
given by White Asura.

00:08:02.345 --> 00:08:03.625
But people

00:08:03.705 --> 00:08:05.625
were coming and going during the day.

00:08:06.185 --> 00:08:07.145
I dared not act rashly.

00:08:08.185 --> 00:08:09.865
I memorized the location of the parrot

00:08:10.905 --> 00:08:14.025
and went back at night,
when no one was around.

00:08:25.305 --> 00:08:27.025
White Asura didn't deceive me.

00:08:28.065 --> 00:08:29.825
I found the ginseng seeds.

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:35.664
But I also destroyed
Brilliant Lady Dou's magnolia.

00:08:36.385 --> 00:08:40.585
I was planning to lie low for a while.

00:08:41.545 --> 00:08:44.105
But my son desperately
needed the medicine.

00:08:44.705 --> 00:08:46.745
Besides, although Brilliant Lady Dou

00:08:46.825 --> 00:08:48.545
and Your Ladyship
started the investigation,

00:08:48.625 --> 00:08:50.905
White Asura had left me
more ginseng seeds.

00:08:51.705 --> 00:08:55.145
I knew it was risky, but I had no choice.

00:08:55.905 --> 00:08:58.345
I had to save my son.

00:09:00.265 --> 00:09:02.865
As long as you sincerely
believe in White Asura,

00:09:03.705 --> 00:09:06.065
you'll get whatever you want.

00:09:06.745 --> 00:09:08.545
It's only been us failing them.

00:09:08.625 --> 00:09:10.305
But they have always

00:09:10.385 --> 00:09:13.905
been blessing the poor and pitiful.

00:09:15.105 --> 00:09:16.065
This time,

00:09:17.145 --> 00:09:19.145
I certainly won't let them go.

00:09:22.185 --> 00:09:23.865
How are you going to keep them here?

00:09:29.745 --> 00:09:30.825
With piety.

00:09:33.745 --> 00:09:36.065
That person in white was White Asura?

00:09:36.145 --> 00:09:37.265
Yes.

00:09:37.345 --> 00:09:40.025
Was it a man or a woman,
and what did they look like?

00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:42.785
Deities exist beyond
mortal concepts of gender.

00:09:42.865 --> 00:09:46.065
How could we mortals
perceive their true form?

00:09:46.665 --> 00:09:48.665
Were you in the palace each time

00:09:49.385 --> 00:09:50.545
White Asura manifested?

00:09:51.265 --> 00:09:52.105
That's right.

00:09:53.825 --> 00:09:54.945
Don't you find it strange?

00:09:56.385 --> 00:09:57.265
What…

00:09:58.425 --> 00:09:59.265
What about it?

00:10:00.065 --> 00:10:01.265
They kept helping you

00:10:01.785 --> 00:10:02.945
without asking anything in return?

00:10:05.425 --> 00:10:08.905
They simply asked for my piety.

00:10:11.505 --> 00:10:12.705
What kind of piety?

00:10:13.225 --> 00:10:14.225
How much money?

00:10:14.305 --> 00:10:15.465
Money?

00:10:16.465 --> 00:10:19.065
Would deities ever need
such mortal things?

00:10:22.665 --> 00:10:25.905
If White Asura
was so compassionate and desireless,

00:10:26.425 --> 00:10:27.465
why did they leave?

00:10:28.185 --> 00:10:30.385
And why did they come back
after two years?

00:10:31.425 --> 00:10:34.625
They left out of disappointment.

00:10:35.705 --> 00:10:37.265
They came back out of mercy.

00:10:38.785 --> 00:10:40.105
With gratitude to you, White Asura.

00:10:43.505 --> 00:10:46.385
A white parrot showed you the spot?

00:10:47.905 --> 00:10:48.745
Yes.

00:10:49.945 --> 00:10:54.025
There is only one white parrot
that flies around the Penglai Pool.

00:10:54.945 --> 00:10:55.785
That's right.

00:10:56.825 --> 00:10:59.465
It's Lady in Snow, given to Consort Shu

00:11:01.465 --> 00:11:02.825
by His Majesty.

00:11:06.025 --> 00:11:06.625
TRANQUIL BREEZE, LUMINOUS MOON

00:11:06.705 --> 00:11:08.825
Why did you come so early in the morning?

00:11:08.905 --> 00:11:10.345
I've been busy till dawn.

00:11:10.425 --> 00:11:13.625
I went to sleep
but felt hungry all of a sudden.

00:11:13.705 --> 00:11:17.505
And I started craving
a bowl of five-flavor wontons.

00:11:18.385 --> 00:11:20.585
Then I just ended up in your palace.

00:11:23.145 --> 00:11:25.345
I just hate to see you work so hard.

00:11:25.425 --> 00:11:26.665
You're ruining your health.

00:11:27.385 --> 00:11:29.985
The five-flavor wontons
you have are the best.

00:11:30.065 --> 00:11:32.305
I'll take a bowl to His Majesty.

00:11:32.385 --> 00:11:34.985
His Majesty is busy with work.
Don't bother him.

00:11:36.705 --> 00:11:38.465
Why are you so shy?

00:11:39.065 --> 00:11:40.865
If he doesn't come, just invite him.

00:11:40.945 --> 00:11:43.305
Don't let Brilliant Lady Dou
walk all over you.

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:47.905
The fates of the palace people
shift like the tides.

00:11:47.985 --> 00:11:49.305
You know this well.

00:11:50.105 --> 00:11:52.585
His Majesty's favor ebbs and flows.

00:11:53.185 --> 00:11:55.545
When His Majesty used to visit me often,

00:11:55.625 --> 00:11:57.265
they were all smiles.

00:11:57.345 --> 00:11:58.945
Perhaps it's for the good.

00:11:59.465 --> 00:12:02.305
At least now I can glimpse
what is true and what is false.

00:12:03.905 --> 00:12:04.905
Aren't you worried?

00:12:06.785 --> 00:12:07.945
Why would I be?

00:12:09.625 --> 00:12:10.905
Then I'm relieved.

00:12:11.745 --> 00:12:14.425
No matter what,
you're the only Consort Shu in the palace.

00:12:16.465 --> 00:12:18.585
May you be well, Your Highness.

00:12:19.985 --> 00:12:21.745
This little thing startled me.

00:12:22.585 --> 00:12:23.945
That was really loud.

00:12:24.025 --> 00:12:26.265
Fuqu. Take Lady in Snow out.

00:12:26.345 --> 00:12:27.385
Understood.

00:12:28.305 --> 00:12:29.185
Wait.

00:12:32.625 --> 00:12:33.825
Let me see it.

00:12:37.905 --> 00:12:39.345
This parrot is well kept.

00:12:39.865 --> 00:12:41.905
Beautiful feathers and a nice voice.

00:12:43.345 --> 00:12:44.625
Are you taking care of it?

00:12:44.705 --> 00:12:45.425
FUQU PALACE MAID

00:12:45.505 --> 00:12:48.145
I'm simply taking it out
for a few hours every day.

00:12:48.225 --> 00:12:50.145
Someone else is looking after it.

00:12:52.385 --> 00:12:54.225
Where does it usually go?

00:12:54.745 --> 00:12:56.425
Sometimes, Yuchun Garden.

00:12:56.505 --> 00:12:57.985
Sometimes, Penglai Pool.

00:12:59.185 --> 00:13:00.625
How do you make it listen?

00:13:04.705 --> 00:13:07.065
Lady in Snow
is His Majesty's gift to Her Highness.

00:13:07.145 --> 00:13:08.465
It doesn't listen to me.

00:13:08.545 --> 00:13:10.905
I only set it free in the garden

00:13:10.985 --> 00:13:12.465
every day.

00:13:12.545 --> 00:13:14.425
Wherever it goes, I follow.

00:13:14.505 --> 00:13:16.905
When it's tired, it flies back on its own.

00:13:16.985 --> 00:13:18.545
And I bring it back.

00:13:23.105 --> 00:13:25.665
Your Highness,
I'm taking Lady in Snow out.

00:13:31.145 --> 00:13:32.865
That little thing is very clever.

00:13:33.385 --> 00:13:34.905
It's quite like a child.

00:13:35.585 --> 00:13:36.625
How is it clever?

00:13:36.705 --> 00:13:39.265
It only says,
"May you be well, Your Highness."

00:13:39.345 --> 00:13:41.385
I was teaching it to greet His Majesty,

00:13:41.465 --> 00:13:42.785
but it couldn't learn.

00:13:44.785 --> 00:13:47.145
Has Your Highness heard of White Asura?

00:13:48.425 --> 00:13:49.265
What is that?

00:13:51.145 --> 00:13:53.705
Nothing. I just learned about it.

00:13:54.825 --> 00:13:56.145
Your Highness.

00:13:56.225 --> 00:13:58.545
I'll go to sleep. See you another time.

00:13:58.625 --> 00:13:59.625
Go ahead.

00:14:05.785 --> 00:14:08.425
It's been half a month.
I finally got a good night's sleep.

00:14:08.985 --> 00:14:10.025
Your Ladyship.

00:14:10.545 --> 00:14:11.545
Hungry?

00:14:18.945 --> 00:14:20.025
I know you're the best.

00:14:20.705 --> 00:14:22.905
You should be hungry.
You slept for eight hours.

00:14:23.985 --> 00:14:25.225
Have I slept so long?

00:14:27.025 --> 00:14:27.865
Your Ladyship.

00:14:28.825 --> 00:14:30.945
Your Ladyship,
Pan Yongqi finally confessed.

00:14:31.025 --> 00:14:32.785
By "devout worship,"

00:14:32.865 --> 00:14:34.465
they meant performing rites
for White Asura

00:14:34.545 --> 00:14:35.905
at a shrine within the palace.

00:14:36.585 --> 00:14:38.705
He was so stubborn. How did you break him?

00:14:39.745 --> 00:14:40.785
It must have been your idea.

00:14:41.625 --> 00:14:43.025
I offered him ginseng seeds.

00:14:43.545 --> 00:14:44.665
Let's take a look.

00:14:44.745 --> 00:14:46.185
Ginseng seeds?

00:14:46.705 --> 00:14:49.185
Your Ladyship,
can you use the evidence like that?

00:14:50.105 --> 00:14:50.985
What evidence?

00:14:51.505 --> 00:14:54.025
They're not registered.
How are they evidence?

00:14:59.385 --> 00:15:00.345
But…

00:15:00.985 --> 00:15:03.025
I'm in charge of the registration.

00:15:38.065 --> 00:15:40.145
- This way.
- No tricks.

00:16:01.105 --> 00:16:01.945
Right here.

00:16:23.145 --> 00:16:24.585
White Asura.

00:16:35.145 --> 00:16:36.425
White Asura.

00:16:38.865 --> 00:16:39.705
White Asura.

00:16:39.785 --> 00:16:41.505
- White Asura is here.
- Behave.

00:16:41.585 --> 00:16:42.545
Watch him.

00:16:43.625 --> 00:16:45.185
White Asura. White Asura.

00:17:42.105 --> 00:17:44.105
The Upper Primordial Heavenly Court

00:17:44.745 --> 00:17:46.305
manifests its majesty,

00:17:47.545 --> 00:17:49.185
where the central gate

00:17:49.865 --> 00:17:50.825
is occupied by the upright and impartial.

00:17:55.945 --> 00:17:58.385
Someone set a trap
in the bamboo forest to hypnotize you.

00:17:58.465 --> 00:18:00.345
That person was likely watching.

00:18:01.025 --> 00:18:03.665
To see clearly in the bamboo forest,
you'll need a bird's-eye view.

00:18:29.305 --> 00:18:30.225
Your Ladyship.

00:18:30.825 --> 00:18:31.985
Why are you here?

00:18:32.065 --> 00:18:33.985
I work at the Bureau of Gardens,

00:18:34.065 --> 00:18:36.945
responsible for planting.
I had just repotted the flowers.

00:18:37.025 --> 00:18:39.025
Why were you standing by the railing?

00:18:39.105 --> 00:18:41.905
The sound of bells made me curious.

00:18:41.985 --> 00:18:43.145
So I looked around.

00:18:43.745 --> 00:18:45.585
You are so intertwined with this case.

00:18:45.665 --> 00:18:46.745
I keep running into you.

00:18:47.345 --> 00:18:48.265
Your Ladyship.

00:18:48.345 --> 00:18:51.065
I have always followed the rules
and never done anything wicked.

00:18:51.665 --> 00:18:53.985
The honest ones who turn wicked
are truly troublesome.

00:18:56.585 --> 00:18:59.185
What kind of plants
require handling late at night?

00:18:59.265 --> 00:19:01.425
These plants have delicate roots.

00:19:01.505 --> 00:19:03.105
If repotted in daylight,
they won't survive.

00:19:03.185 --> 00:19:04.425
It must be done at night.

00:19:04.505 --> 00:19:05.705
Full of tricks.

00:19:06.825 --> 00:19:07.985
Your Ladyship, spare me.

00:19:09.745 --> 00:19:12.305
I wouldn't find ginseng seeds
in these pots, would I?

00:19:13.385 --> 00:19:14.865
Ginseng seeds?

00:19:14.945 --> 00:19:16.545
These are just common plants.

00:19:16.625 --> 00:19:17.945
Do you know White Asura?

00:19:18.865 --> 00:19:19.705
No, Your Ladyship.

00:19:21.545 --> 00:19:23.505
Won't you even ask me what that is?

00:19:32.585 --> 00:19:35.345
It's late. You'd better
get going, Mr. Xiao.

00:19:36.505 --> 00:19:37.785
How long will you avoid me?

00:19:38.385 --> 00:19:40.425
- Do you think you can stop me?
- No, I don't.

00:19:41.145 --> 00:19:41.985
But I have to.

00:19:43.825 --> 00:19:44.825
Alright.

00:19:44.905 --> 00:19:47.545
Tell me, Mr. Xiao. What do you want?

00:19:49.065 --> 00:19:50.065
I want to apologize.

00:19:52.905 --> 00:19:55.865
I withheld the truth
because I was arrogant.

00:19:56.945 --> 00:19:59.785
I thought I was protecting you
by keeping those memories from you.

00:20:01.465 --> 00:20:03.705
But the truth is, I was weak.

00:20:04.345 --> 00:20:07.025
I figured if I couldn't face it,
neither could you,

00:20:07.105 --> 00:20:09.985
and if I couldn't take it,
you couldn't either.

00:20:11.025 --> 00:20:11.945
But I was wrong.

00:20:15.345 --> 00:20:16.745
I have not lived through

00:20:17.545 --> 00:20:18.985
your 15 years of pain,

00:20:19.585 --> 00:20:22.105
so I have no right to decide for you.

00:20:22.905 --> 00:20:23.865
You're a lot braver than I am.

00:20:23.945 --> 00:20:25.985
You deserve the truth you want.

00:20:26.825 --> 00:20:27.865
You don't need to apologize.

00:20:28.465 --> 00:20:29.545
You did nothing wrong.

00:20:30.865 --> 00:20:33.305
I forced you to stay by my side
because you could help me

00:20:33.385 --> 00:20:34.825
regain my memories.

00:20:34.905 --> 00:20:37.505
Now, I remember it all.

00:20:37.585 --> 00:20:39.825
- I don't need you anymore.
- But I need you.

00:20:41.145 --> 00:20:41.985
At the Lantern Festival Banquet,

00:20:42.585 --> 00:20:44.385
you used His Majesty's authority
to keep me by your side.

00:20:44.465 --> 00:20:47.025
Someone as smart as you
must have known that I stayed

00:20:47.105 --> 00:20:49.185
not just because of that imperial decree.

00:20:55.145 --> 00:20:55.985
Peiyi.

00:20:57.265 --> 00:21:00.025
I may not have many ways to make you stay.

00:21:01.345 --> 00:21:02.825
But I wish to stand by your side.

00:21:05.905 --> 00:21:06.785
That's all I know.

00:21:12.145 --> 00:21:13.745
Mr. Xiao, stop talking big.

00:21:14.745 --> 00:21:16.345
No one stays by anyone's side forever.

00:21:17.065 --> 00:21:19.145
My parents and my master

00:21:19.225 --> 00:21:20.625
all left me.

00:21:21.905 --> 00:21:23.985
No matter how reluctant they were to die,

00:21:25.025 --> 00:21:27.465
death would never show mercy.

00:21:29.065 --> 00:21:31.025
All these years of investigation work

00:21:31.905 --> 00:21:33.225
taught me one thing.

00:21:34.145 --> 00:21:36.505
Even if I try my best
and uncover the truth,

00:21:37.585 --> 00:21:39.145
it doesn't change anything.

00:21:41.985 --> 00:21:43.945
The dead are dead.

00:21:44.745 --> 00:21:46.465
The living still suffer.

00:21:47.065 --> 00:21:48.745
I advise you to stay away from me.

00:21:49.625 --> 00:21:51.465
I'm really a cursed lone star.

00:21:52.465 --> 00:21:55.025
Stay by my side and you will die.

00:21:55.105 --> 00:21:57.025
- I'm not afraid.
- But I am.

00:22:00.545 --> 00:22:02.385
I don't want to lose anyone again.

00:22:03.065 --> 00:22:04.185
Do you dare to take a gamble?

00:22:07.025 --> 00:22:08.905
On what? Against whom?

00:22:08.985 --> 00:22:11.345
Against Heaven. Against fate.

00:22:14.745 --> 00:22:16.065
See if I end up dead

00:22:17.305 --> 00:22:18.145
by your side.

00:22:18.225 --> 00:22:19.305
Are you crazy?

00:22:19.385 --> 00:22:21.145
Just think I'm crazy.

00:22:22.985 --> 00:22:24.465
I was going crazy

00:22:25.145 --> 00:22:26.265
without you.

00:22:29.305 --> 00:22:30.385
I've made up my mind.

00:22:30.905 --> 00:22:33.705
- This is my business alone.
- No, it's not.

00:22:36.705 --> 00:22:39.985
I'm not doing it just because of you.

00:22:40.865 --> 00:22:42.545
This is also my nightmare.

00:22:43.065 --> 00:22:44.625
I also want to wake up.

00:22:49.665 --> 00:22:52.585
It would be best
if I could face it with you.

00:22:54.105 --> 00:22:55.345
Even if you turn me down again,

00:22:57.385 --> 00:22:58.465
I won't give up.

00:23:05.665 --> 00:23:06.625
Alright.

00:23:07.385 --> 00:23:08.505
I'll take a gamble.

00:23:09.265 --> 00:23:11.705
If you die, I will avenge you.

00:23:11.785 --> 00:23:14.105
- If I die--
- I will avenge you,

00:23:15.065 --> 00:23:16.185
no matter what.

00:23:23.905 --> 00:23:24.785
Let's go find Wuren.

00:23:31.985 --> 00:23:33.025
Your Ladyship.

00:23:34.825 --> 00:23:36.865
- What happened?
- Pan Yongqi died.

00:23:44.345 --> 00:23:45.225
What happened?

00:23:58.745 --> 00:23:59.585
White Asura.

00:24:02.545 --> 00:24:04.265
White Asura.

00:24:04.345 --> 00:24:06.265
- White Asura, don't go.
- Stop fooling yourself.

00:24:06.865 --> 00:24:08.665
If White Asura could protect you,
how did you get caught?

00:24:09.345 --> 00:24:10.545
Give me another chance.

00:24:11.505 --> 00:24:12.825
Give me another chance.

00:24:13.425 --> 00:24:14.905
Give me another chance.

00:24:24.785 --> 00:24:26.945
I shall return with you, White Asura.

00:24:28.905 --> 00:24:29.865
Pan Yongqi.

00:24:33.985 --> 00:24:35.505
I shall return with you,

00:24:36.745 --> 00:24:38.465
White Asura.

00:24:44.585 --> 00:24:46.305
Did you see anyone pass by
with a crossbow?

00:24:46.385 --> 00:24:47.545
No.

00:24:47.625 --> 00:24:49.225
I didn't see anyone all the way.

00:24:50.145 --> 00:24:51.905
Pan Yongqi showed no signs of fear

00:24:51.985 --> 00:24:53.665
and didn't even try to dodge the bolt.

00:24:54.665 --> 00:24:55.865
I can't tell what it was like.

00:24:58.265 --> 00:24:59.105
Pious.

00:25:00.625 --> 00:25:02.585
Yeah. He was pious.

00:25:04.545 --> 00:25:06.985
This bolt is used by the Imperial Guards.

00:25:07.065 --> 00:25:08.585
The maximum range is about ten zhang.

00:25:09.185 --> 00:25:10.905
If I trace the trajectory of the bolt,

00:25:10.985 --> 00:25:12.385
I might find traces of the killer.

00:25:14.585 --> 00:25:16.505
Who knows what lurks in these bamboos?

00:25:16.585 --> 00:25:17.425
Don't go alone.

00:25:19.225 --> 00:25:20.185
Go with Mr. Xiao.

00:25:20.265 --> 00:25:21.265
Alright.

00:25:25.945 --> 00:25:26.905
You reconciled?

00:25:28.665 --> 00:25:30.025
Stay here. I'll look around.

00:25:30.105 --> 00:25:31.185
Understood.

00:25:34.945 --> 00:25:36.665
I came from the rockery

00:25:37.185 --> 00:25:39.505
and ran into Wuren near here.

00:25:40.545 --> 00:25:42.505
Judging from the location of the body

00:25:42.585 --> 00:25:44.265
and the angle of the bolt shot,

00:25:44.345 --> 00:25:46.625
we can confirm
that the bolt came from here.

00:25:47.345 --> 00:25:49.785
The two of you came from two directions,

00:25:49.865 --> 00:25:51.905
but neither of you spotted the killer.

00:26:01.545 --> 00:26:02.945
Mr. Xiao, stay here.

00:26:03.025 --> 00:26:04.025
I'll go.

00:26:04.865 --> 00:26:05.785
Be careful.

00:26:09.025 --> 00:26:09.945
Found it.

00:26:12.825 --> 00:26:15.105
Killed by a bolt. No poisoning.

00:26:15.185 --> 00:26:16.385
No other wounds.

00:26:18.585 --> 00:26:21.585
Outsiders can't easily obtain the weapons
of Imperial Guards.

00:26:21.665 --> 00:26:22.625
An Imperial Guard did it?

00:26:22.705 --> 00:26:25.465
But since he wanted to play tricks,

00:26:25.545 --> 00:26:27.025
why reveal his identity?

00:26:32.385 --> 00:26:33.625
"All hail White Asura"?

00:26:34.225 --> 00:26:36.825
He was tied up.
When did he put it in his mouth?

00:26:38.185 --> 00:26:40.465
This paper has been waxed
and doesn't get wet.

00:26:40.545 --> 00:26:43.105
He probably kept it in his mouth
before going to the altar.

00:26:43.905 --> 00:26:45.105
He knew he was going to die?

00:26:49.345 --> 00:26:50.865
If I had been more alert,

00:26:50.945 --> 00:26:52.025
Pan Yongqi wouldn't have died.

00:26:52.105 --> 00:26:54.825
He was determined to die.
You couldn't do much.

00:27:01.065 --> 00:27:02.625
These bells…

00:27:02.705 --> 00:27:04.305
The killer set up the bells

00:27:04.385 --> 00:27:07.065
to hypnotize you the moment you enter
the bamboo forest.

00:27:07.145 --> 00:27:09.665
The night in the bamboo forest
was silent and eerie.

00:27:09.745 --> 00:27:12.185
Dense stalks and leaves obscured the moon,

00:27:12.265 --> 00:27:13.945
leaving you disoriented.

00:27:14.025 --> 00:27:17.145
That person lured you with a bell's chime.

00:27:17.225 --> 00:27:19.105
When you fixate on abnormal sounds

00:27:19.185 --> 00:27:21.225
with heightened tension,

00:27:21.305 --> 00:27:23.225
your other senses let down their guard.

00:27:23.305 --> 00:27:25.985
In the end, when you reached the altar,

00:27:26.065 --> 00:27:28.105
the spinning wind wheels

00:27:28.185 --> 00:27:31.425
hypnotized you and rendered you confused.

00:27:31.505 --> 00:27:32.665
White Asura.

00:27:33.705 --> 00:27:34.705
I remember

00:27:35.225 --> 00:27:36.745
that Pan Yongqi
knelt in front of the altar

00:27:36.825 --> 00:27:37.985
and shouted, "White Asura."

00:27:38.065 --> 00:27:39.345
Then we saw the ghostly figures.

00:27:40.265 --> 00:27:41.185
Pan Yongqi set us up?

00:27:42.625 --> 00:27:45.305
No. His reaction was the same as ours.

00:27:45.385 --> 00:27:47.025
He was more like a pawn.

00:27:47.105 --> 00:27:49.385
But his blind worship of White Asura

00:27:49.465 --> 00:27:51.065
enhanced the hypnosis.

00:27:51.145 --> 00:27:52.385
What he shouted

00:27:52.465 --> 00:27:54.345
became the key
to pushing us into the illusion.

00:27:55.025 --> 00:27:56.105
These bells

00:27:56.185 --> 00:27:58.065
were strung on the bamboo branches

00:27:58.145 --> 00:27:59.305
and chimed when the wind blew.

00:28:00.185 --> 00:28:01.425
But their tones were sharp and hasty.

00:28:01.505 --> 00:28:05.465
Some bells were hung there,
but there was more to it.

00:28:08.185 --> 00:28:10.385
There was a weasel caught in a snare.

00:28:10.985 --> 00:28:13.665
There were plenty of bells
tied to the bamboo.

00:28:13.745 --> 00:28:15.985
The weasel struggled
and jostled the branches,

00:28:16.065 --> 00:28:17.985
making the bells clatter in bursts.

00:28:18.665 --> 00:28:21.585
I set it free.
And it smoked me with a fart.

00:28:23.745 --> 00:28:26.025
How did the weasel get caught by this net?

00:28:35.265 --> 00:28:36.705
This is an animal trap.

00:28:36.785 --> 00:28:38.705
Put the food in it.

00:28:38.785 --> 00:28:39.665
When the weasel

00:28:39.745 --> 00:28:41.745
steps on the wire
connecting the mechanism,

00:28:41.825 --> 00:28:42.665
it bounces off

00:28:42.745 --> 00:28:44.065
and the net closes

00:28:44.145 --> 00:28:45.585
to trap the weasel inside.

00:28:45.665 --> 00:28:47.985
This is rare to find in the palace.

00:28:48.065 --> 00:28:49.665
Lightweight and hidden.

00:28:49.745 --> 00:28:51.905
A few leaves can cover it up.

00:28:52.505 --> 00:28:54.585
This murderer has a lot of tricks.

00:28:57.785 --> 00:28:58.905
Have you found the crossbow?

00:28:59.505 --> 00:29:01.945
Yes. But the bolt was the bamboo.

00:29:05.745 --> 00:29:06.865
Bing Shen 57.

00:29:07.465 --> 00:29:09.705
Pan Yongqi's helmet also bears that code.

00:29:10.265 --> 00:29:12.105
He was shot by his own crossbow.

00:29:14.865 --> 00:29:16.905
This bamboo is extremely tough

00:29:16.985 --> 00:29:19.145
and holds enough power to pull the trigger

00:29:19.225 --> 00:29:20.305
and shoot the bolt.

00:29:27.425 --> 00:29:29.665
What a perfect spot.

00:29:29.745 --> 00:29:31.305
The person knew that this crossbow

00:29:31.385 --> 00:29:33.865
had to be steady to hit the target.

00:29:35.505 --> 00:29:36.785
Bamboo leaves fall this season

00:29:36.865 --> 00:29:39.185
and cover the ground in an instant,

00:29:39.265 --> 00:29:41.065
covering the footprints.

00:29:58.705 --> 00:30:00.065
Deep at the heel, shallow at the toe.

00:30:00.145 --> 00:30:01.825
The pressure rested on the hindfoot.

00:30:01.905 --> 00:30:03.825
Proof of retreat.

00:30:05.065 --> 00:30:06.505
He was pulling back the bamboo.

00:30:10.265 --> 00:30:12.705
The person should be above six chi.

00:30:12.785 --> 00:30:14.065
Strongly built.

00:30:14.825 --> 00:30:17.505
His left foot bears greater weight

00:30:18.105 --> 00:30:20.505
and turns outward,
while his right steps normally.

00:30:25.945 --> 00:30:26.865
It was Pan Yongqi.

00:30:28.065 --> 00:30:29.705
Pan Yongqi?

00:30:30.945 --> 00:30:33.305
He set up the trap to kill himself?

00:30:35.865 --> 00:30:38.385
No wonder he looked like
he knew about his doom.

00:30:38.985 --> 00:30:40.545
The bamboo is tough.

00:30:40.625 --> 00:30:43.425
Attach it to the trigger
and it shoots the bolts powerfully.

00:30:43.945 --> 00:30:47.025
So, something must be placed there
to catch the trigger.

00:30:47.705 --> 00:30:49.345
Remove it when it's time,

00:30:49.425 --> 00:30:51.145
the bamboo bounces back

00:30:51.225 --> 00:30:53.305
and pulls the trigger to release the shot.

00:30:53.385 --> 00:30:55.185
But we've searched this area.

00:30:55.265 --> 00:30:57.425
There was nothing
except for this crossbow.

00:30:58.145 --> 00:30:59.025
Ice.

00:30:59.105 --> 00:31:00.865
Ice cubes are hard enough
to hold the trigger.

00:31:00.945 --> 00:31:02.185
When the ice melts,

00:31:02.265 --> 00:31:04.425
the bamboo can pull the trigger.

00:31:05.145 --> 00:31:06.705
When Pan Yongqi was shot,

00:31:06.785 --> 00:31:07.985
did you hear or see something?

00:31:12.185 --> 00:31:13.145
The drum.

00:31:13.985 --> 00:31:16.745
Pan Yongqi heard the drums

00:31:16.825 --> 00:31:18.305
and rushed to the altar to die.

00:31:18.385 --> 00:31:19.905
So it wasn't ice.

00:31:19.985 --> 00:31:22.305
It's hard to control how fast ice melts.

00:31:31.385 --> 00:31:32.265
It was a pine strip.

00:31:34.825 --> 00:31:36.825
A pine strip was set
behind the crossbow trigger.

00:31:36.905 --> 00:31:39.825
When it burned to the trigger,
it would drop off,

00:31:40.505 --> 00:31:42.665
allowing the bamboo to pull the trigger.

00:31:42.745 --> 00:31:45.145
The pine strips used for incense
in the palace are all standardized.

00:31:45.225 --> 00:31:47.345
It takes two hours to burn.

00:31:47.425 --> 00:31:50.305
Someone timed it
and lit the strip beforehand.

00:31:50.385 --> 00:31:53.265
Then the ashes drifted away with the wind,

00:31:54.225 --> 00:31:56.265
but the few traces left could prove it.

00:32:01.345 --> 00:32:02.585
I shall return with you,

00:32:04.385 --> 00:32:05.225
White Asura.

00:32:06.265 --> 00:32:08.025
Pan Yongqi was arrested yesterday.

00:32:08.545 --> 00:32:10.945
When did he light the pine strip?

00:32:11.545 --> 00:32:12.785
Someone else did it.

00:32:12.865 --> 00:32:14.745
And this person is extremely cautious.

00:32:15.345 --> 00:32:17.825
He scattered
these fallen leaves on purpose

00:32:18.345 --> 00:32:19.825
to cover the footprints.

00:32:20.425 --> 00:32:22.265
So, Pan Yongqi had a solid plan.

00:32:22.345 --> 00:32:23.545
If he hadn't been caught,

00:32:24.145 --> 00:32:25.785
he could have completed
everything on his own

00:32:25.865 --> 00:32:27.425
and embraced his death at the altar.

00:32:28.025 --> 00:32:29.465
But if anything happened,

00:32:29.545 --> 00:32:31.385
someone else who knew his plan

00:32:31.465 --> 00:32:33.385
would light the pine strip for him.

00:32:33.985 --> 00:32:34.945
No wonder.

00:32:35.745 --> 00:32:38.145
I gave him the ginseng
seeds at the Wei hour,

00:32:38.705 --> 00:32:40.625
but he confessed
halfway into the Shen hour.

00:32:41.985 --> 00:32:44.425
He wasn't being tough. He was waiting

00:32:44.505 --> 00:32:47.345
for his partner to light the pine strip

00:32:47.425 --> 00:32:49.065
so he could go to the altar as planned.

00:32:49.145 --> 00:32:51.665
That person helped him commit suicide.

00:32:52.385 --> 00:32:55.265
We have to find that person
to get an answer.

00:32:55.865 --> 00:32:57.705
We have always been in charge

00:32:57.785 --> 00:32:59.305
of the gardening in Xingqing Palace.

00:32:59.385 --> 00:33:02.425
Everything you want to know
is recorded here.

00:33:04.905 --> 00:33:06.105
{\an8}Supervised by Fuqu.

00:33:07.185 --> 00:33:08.025
It's her again.

00:33:08.825 --> 00:33:10.585
The one who takes care of Lady in Snow?

00:33:11.425 --> 00:33:12.305
That's right.

00:33:13.265 --> 00:33:15.545
Fuqu doesn't talk much.

00:33:15.625 --> 00:33:18.625
She's either tending to the plants
or being alone.

00:33:18.705 --> 00:33:21.065
She only likes Lady in Snow.

00:33:22.145 --> 00:33:25.345
She is tending to the garden.
Why did she go to serve Consort Shu?

00:33:26.105 --> 00:33:28.625
They say that Lady in Snow
only listens to her call.

00:33:28.705 --> 00:33:31.625
It landed on her the first time it saw her

00:33:31.705 --> 00:33:33.185
by the Penglai Pool.

00:33:33.865 --> 00:33:35.945
So Consort Shu asked her to take it out

00:33:36.025 --> 00:33:37.945
for fun every day.

00:33:38.465 --> 00:33:40.185
She likes the bird, too,

00:33:40.265 --> 00:33:42.065
and often makes puree for it.

00:33:42.145 --> 00:33:44.705
But she doesn't serve Consort Shu.

00:33:45.305 --> 00:33:47.985
The palace maid personally sent
by Consort Shu for this job

00:33:48.065 --> 00:33:48.905
is called Mingcui.

00:33:57.465 --> 00:33:59.225
Heading to see Lady in Snow again?

00:34:05.345 --> 00:34:08.105
Refreshing aroma. You made it yourself?

00:34:08.945 --> 00:34:10.264
I don't burn incense.

00:34:12.225 --> 00:34:14.225
I probably got the smell from the flowers.

00:34:15.585 --> 00:34:18.784
It smells good.
I bet Lady in Snow likes it, too.

00:34:26.985 --> 00:34:29.105
From the magnolia to the bird,

00:34:29.185 --> 00:34:31.465
to the pavilion near the altar,
we keep seeing her.

00:34:31.545 --> 00:34:33.585
She's definitely hiding something.

00:34:33.665 --> 00:34:34.625
Why don't we arrest her?

00:34:34.705 --> 00:34:36.304
We can't anymore.

00:34:36.385 --> 00:34:37.585
Why not?

00:34:38.225 --> 00:34:39.385
I asked the chief gardener.

00:34:39.905 --> 00:34:42.865
Fuqu was taking care of the plants
from the beginning of the Shen hour

00:34:42.945 --> 00:34:45.304
until I came to her and never left.

00:34:46.264 --> 00:34:49.385
The guards nearby and her fellow workers
can testify for her.

00:34:52.185 --> 00:34:53.105
Your Ladyship.

00:34:53.744 --> 00:34:54.705
I found something.

00:34:54.784 --> 00:34:57.385
The southwestern shamans
use sound and visual tricks

00:34:57.465 --> 00:34:59.425
to hypnotize victims
and make them submissive.

00:34:59.505 --> 00:35:02.185
And they often set snares
in the thick woods

00:35:02.265 --> 00:35:04.785
to trap wild mice for medicine testing.

00:35:05.305 --> 00:35:08.945
So this person can roam the palace
undetected at night

00:35:09.025 --> 00:35:10.945
and knows the ways of the shamans.

00:35:11.025 --> 00:35:12.865
I'll follow this lead.

00:35:15.465 --> 00:35:17.905
Mr. Xiao. What should we look into?

00:35:18.505 --> 00:35:21.665
One particular item has strict records
of its amount and usage.

00:35:21.745 --> 00:35:23.665
Any misappropriation of it
will leave a trace.

00:35:24.665 --> 00:35:25.505
Ginseng seeds?

00:35:28.545 --> 00:35:29.745
That's all?

00:35:29.825 --> 00:35:30.785
No.

00:35:30.865 --> 00:35:32.705
These are left outside for emergency use.

00:35:32.785 --> 00:35:34.785
Most of them are in high cabinets.

00:35:38.585 --> 00:35:39.905
Why are there two locks?

00:35:40.665 --> 00:35:43.025
Precious materials
are not accessible to all.

00:35:43.105 --> 00:35:46.105
We check the prescriptions from the Aide

00:35:46.185 --> 00:35:48.385
to the Imperial Physician
before giving them out.

00:35:48.465 --> 00:35:49.905
We hold two keys.

00:35:49.985 --> 00:35:53.145
One with me,
the other with Physician Luo Zhian.

00:35:53.945 --> 00:35:55.745
But they're so small.

00:35:55.825 --> 00:35:57.865
Isn't it hard to detect
even if some are stolen?

00:35:57.945 --> 00:35:59.345
No.

00:35:59.425 --> 00:36:01.465
There are records
of their dosage and quantity.

00:36:01.545 --> 00:36:03.705
Physician Luo checks them every month.

00:36:03.785 --> 00:36:05.265
And I double-check afterward.

00:36:06.065 --> 00:36:07.785
What if something spoils?

00:36:07.865 --> 00:36:09.825
We burn them in bulk.

00:36:17.385 --> 00:36:19.585
MEDICINAL MATERIAL USAGE RECORD

00:36:21.625 --> 00:36:24.825
Wooden box, pine needles,
dried lotus leaves.

00:36:25.465 --> 00:36:26.785
Ginseng seeds fear damp?

00:36:26.865 --> 00:36:27.785
That's right.

00:36:27.865 --> 00:36:29.945
They may not be easy to spoil,

00:36:30.025 --> 00:36:32.865
but they must be stored
in a cool, dry, and ventilated place.

00:36:33.745 --> 00:36:35.425
Why is the loss
in the eighth and ninth months

00:36:35.505 --> 00:36:36.825
higher than usual?

00:36:36.905 --> 00:36:39.305
The Western Capital is rainy and humid
this time of year.

00:36:39.385 --> 00:36:41.825
So the loss is higher than usual.

00:36:42.825 --> 00:36:43.865
Indeed.

00:36:43.945 --> 00:36:45.785
The loss in these two months

00:36:45.865 --> 00:36:47.425
was nearly 10% higher
than the rest of the months.

00:36:47.505 --> 00:36:48.585
It's the same this year.

00:36:49.385 --> 00:36:50.385
Your Ladyship.

00:36:50.465 --> 00:36:52.945
Physician Luo won't be back
from the palace any time soon.

00:36:53.025 --> 00:36:55.945
We're not allowed
to leave our keys behind.

00:36:56.025 --> 00:36:58.745
If Your Ladyship
wants to check the ginseng seeds,

00:36:59.945 --> 00:37:02.545
- you may have to wait.
- It's alright.

00:37:02.625 --> 00:37:04.145
Do you know

00:37:04.225 --> 00:37:06.425
where Physician Luo
resides in the Western Capital?

00:37:06.505 --> 00:37:07.385
Take us there.

00:37:08.545 --> 00:37:11.225
Physician Luo lives here alone.

00:37:11.305 --> 00:37:13.025
His family is in Weizhou, their hometown.

00:37:13.105 --> 00:37:14.865
The room faces north.

00:37:14.945 --> 00:37:16.185
It's a bit dark.

00:37:17.305 --> 00:37:18.745
Physician Luo gets paid well,

00:37:19.265 --> 00:37:20.265
but his room is so humble?

00:37:20.345 --> 00:37:22.385
He doesn't care about such things.

00:37:22.465 --> 00:37:24.545
He's working in the palace
most of the time

00:37:24.625 --> 00:37:26.225
and only comes back to sleep.

00:37:26.305 --> 00:37:28.905
Besides, he sends
most of his income back home

00:37:28.985 --> 00:37:31.145
to support his entire family.

00:37:37.185 --> 00:37:38.465
The room is cold and damp.

00:37:38.545 --> 00:37:41.105
The clothes smell musty.
Is there no place to air and dry them?

00:37:41.945 --> 00:37:42.865
Yes, there is.

00:37:42.945 --> 00:37:45.425
There's a patio where we get some sun.

00:37:52.785 --> 00:37:54.665
What do you think, Mr. Xiao?

00:37:55.345 --> 00:37:58.105
This yard may be dry and airy,

00:37:58.185 --> 00:38:00.265
but why didn't you remove the hive?

00:38:00.345 --> 00:38:02.705
It's troublesome
if you get stung by a bee.

00:38:04.105 --> 00:38:05.945
I haven't seen a bee for a while.

00:38:18.065 --> 00:38:19.105
What…

00:38:23.625 --> 00:38:26.185
Physician Luo stole these
from his own post!

00:38:31.185 --> 00:38:33.305
Spoiled ginseng seeds
have no medicinal use.

00:38:33.385 --> 00:38:34.625
They serve nothing.

00:38:34.705 --> 00:38:36.785
We would burn them anyway.

00:38:36.865 --> 00:38:38.985
You've never played cards, have you?

00:38:40.505 --> 00:38:42.985
Then it's natural that you haven't seen
the tricks of cheaters.

00:38:46.465 --> 00:38:47.785
How many leaves am I holding?

00:38:48.905 --> 00:38:49.985
Five.

00:38:59.945 --> 00:39:01.025
What…

00:39:08.105 --> 00:39:08.945
I switched them.

00:39:10.185 --> 00:39:11.745
That's how Physician Luo

00:39:11.825 --> 00:39:13.865
stole fresh ginseng seeds from the stock.

00:39:15.865 --> 00:39:17.345
Take us to Physician Luo.

00:39:21.745 --> 00:39:22.825
Why didn't we take

00:39:22.905 --> 00:39:24.865
the east path to Talent Liu's palace?

00:39:24.945 --> 00:39:26.585
We should go from there.

00:39:27.185 --> 00:39:28.985
But Physician Luo insists
on taking this Yin-Yang Road

00:39:29.065 --> 00:39:30.505
to see Talent Liu these days.

00:39:30.585 --> 00:39:33.825
This path may be shorter,
but it's really freaky.

00:39:33.905 --> 00:39:34.985
Yin-Yang Road?

00:39:35.505 --> 00:39:37.465
It is a winding corridor
connecting the palaces.

00:39:37.545 --> 00:39:39.385
But it faces the northwest

00:39:39.465 --> 00:39:41.225
and rarely gets sun during the day.

00:39:41.305 --> 00:39:44.065
There is no light at night,
which makes it even darker.

00:39:44.145 --> 00:39:45.745
Day and night, the sun and the moon

00:39:45.825 --> 00:39:47.505
can only illuminate parts of the path.

00:39:47.585 --> 00:39:50.065
The eunuchs and palace maids named it

00:39:50.145 --> 00:39:51.745
the Yin-Yang Road for fun.

00:39:51.825 --> 00:39:53.025
Although it's a shortcut,

00:39:53.105 --> 00:39:54.665
people would rather avoid it.

00:39:55.185 --> 00:39:56.825
Few people take this path,

00:39:57.465 --> 00:39:58.945
which makes it

00:39:59.025 --> 00:40:00.545
even more gloomy.

00:40:01.505 --> 00:40:02.625
Just around the corner.

00:40:17.065 --> 00:40:18.985
Who dropped the lantern?

00:40:29.945 --> 00:40:30.785
Look around.

00:40:34.945 --> 00:40:36.305
Over there.

00:40:39.305 --> 00:40:40.225
Physician Luo.

00:40:41.145 --> 00:40:41.985
It's Physician Luo.

00:40:51.145 --> 00:40:54.745
ALL HAIL WHITE ASURA
