ASTRONOMICAL BUREAU

00:00:21.425 --> 00:00:22.665
Huaijin.

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:26.665
Father.

00:00:27.985 --> 00:00:29.185
What are you doing here?

00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:31.105
Court officials can't just enter
the Astronomical Bureau freely.

00:00:31.985 --> 00:00:34.105
XIAO WENYUAN, CROWN PRINCE'S GRAND TUTOR

00:00:34.185 --> 00:00:35.905
You've been away from home for five years.

00:00:36.705 --> 00:00:39.905
You and I both live
in the Western Capital.

00:00:39.985 --> 00:00:41.785
And we're both officials.

00:00:43.065 --> 00:00:46.425
But I never expected
it would be so hard to meet.

00:00:47.545 --> 00:00:50.465
You should've known this
before I worked here.

00:00:51.425 --> 00:00:52.465
I know.

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:54.745
Officials from the Astronomical Bureau

00:00:54.825 --> 00:00:56.425
are forbidden to mingle
with court ministers,

00:00:56.945 --> 00:00:58.345
even if they're father and son.

00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:02.265
But His Majesty has specifically
allowed you to visit home.

00:01:03.145 --> 00:01:04.305
You refuse to go back,

00:01:05.225 --> 00:01:06.145
so I came to see you.

00:01:06.785 --> 00:01:08.145
Why?

00:01:08.225 --> 00:01:10.145
Are you going to kick me out now

00:01:10.905 --> 00:01:12.545
or report me to the Emperor?

00:01:13.945 --> 00:01:16.305
I guess you have
something important to say.

00:01:18.225 --> 00:01:19.665
I'll get straight to the point.

00:01:21.185 --> 00:01:22.745
I heard His Majesty wants you

00:01:22.825 --> 00:01:24.585
to assist
the Palace Investigation Bureau, right?

00:01:26.825 --> 00:01:28.785
You're still beating around the bush.

00:01:28.865 --> 00:01:31.225
You're trying to mention
Princess of Fuchang County, right?

00:01:34.465 --> 00:01:36.065
She didn't recognize me.

00:01:36.145 --> 00:01:38.465
Maybe, as everyone says,

00:01:38.545 --> 00:01:40.185
she doesn't remember
what happened that night long ago.

00:01:40.905 --> 00:01:42.985
But when she was investigating,

00:01:43.065 --> 00:01:44.545
she never asked for help from anyone.

00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:47.945
So, why did she keep you by her side?

00:01:48.985 --> 00:01:51.385
Do you mean she's faking memory loss?

00:01:53.625 --> 00:01:56.505
She is smart, sensitive,

00:01:56.585 --> 00:01:57.625
and calculating.

00:01:58.545 --> 00:02:00.105
Whether she remembers it or not,

00:02:00.185 --> 00:02:03.225
you should keep your distance from her.

00:02:04.225 --> 00:02:05.065
Father,

00:02:07.025 --> 00:02:08.385
are you feeling guilty?

00:02:12.225 --> 00:02:13.265
Are you still blaming me?

00:02:14.945 --> 00:02:16.185
I've already explained it to you.

00:02:16.985 --> 00:02:18.025
Back then,

00:02:18.665 --> 00:02:20.065
I had no other choice.

00:02:20.905 --> 00:02:22.185
Now, with the Imperial decree,

00:02:22.905 --> 00:02:24.225
I have no choice either.

00:02:25.905 --> 00:02:29.225
Whether you want to hear it or not,

00:02:30.585 --> 00:02:32.025
as a father,

00:02:33.065 --> 00:02:34.545
I only care about you.

00:02:37.985 --> 00:02:39.185
It's getting late.

00:02:39.705 --> 00:02:41.945
Even the Astronomical Bureau
allows you to come and go freely.

00:02:42.025 --> 00:02:43.465
The curfew shouldn't stop you.

00:02:45.025 --> 00:02:45.865
See you, Grand Tutor.

00:04:40.945 --> 00:04:46.585
{\an8}‪ADAPTED FROM A SHUQI.COM NOVEL
‪ORIGINAL AUTHOR: SENLIN LU

00:04:57.585 --> 00:04:59.785
Why are you here, Mr. Xiao?

00:05:01.985 --> 00:05:03.265
It has nothing to do with him.

00:05:07.505 --> 00:05:08.905
I've been following him.

00:05:08.985 --> 00:05:09.825
He didn't have time to commit the crime.

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:26.705
Do you recognize her?

00:05:29.865 --> 00:05:30.785
Are you afraid of seeing blood?

00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:37.145
She's the Right Chancellor's niece,
the Ninth Lady, Cui Manshu.

00:05:38.185 --> 00:05:39.945
I had planned to question her tomorrow,

00:05:40.865 --> 00:05:41.705
but she's already dead.

00:05:48.585 --> 00:05:51.105
The blood hasn't even dried.
The killer hasn't gone far.

00:05:53.825 --> 00:05:56.305
It matches the shoe prints
found by the stage.

00:05:56.385 --> 00:05:57.705
Both are from palace-issued oiled boots.

00:06:10.865 --> 00:06:11.705
He must have gone in that direction.

00:06:29.105 --> 00:06:30.385
You still suspect me?

00:06:31.385 --> 00:06:32.625
I've never suspected you.

00:06:33.225 --> 00:06:34.425
So why did you follow me here?

00:06:35.265 --> 00:06:38.585
Shouldn't you stay out there
waiting for news?

00:06:44.905 --> 00:06:46.385
MAP OF YANSHOU WARD

00:06:47.025 --> 00:06:48.865
This house isn't marked on the map.

00:06:50.105 --> 00:06:51.745
Earlier, I passed by here
with Prosecutor Gu.

00:06:51.825 --> 00:06:55.145
I found it's very close to the waterway
and not far from the black powder shop.

00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:57.065
Yet it's not marked on the map.

00:06:57.145 --> 00:07:00.025
So hidden, so the killer
must have chosen it.

00:07:01.065 --> 00:07:03.345
I've heard some people can track
someone by their traces.

00:07:03.985 --> 00:07:05.905
So you can do that too.

00:07:05.985 --> 00:07:07.505
Looks like I picked the right person.

00:07:09.345 --> 00:07:10.425
Are there any other clues?

00:07:11.345 --> 00:07:12.225
The shoe prints are incomplete.

00:07:12.305 --> 00:07:13.265
These are all we have for now.

00:07:24.185 --> 00:07:25.505
Are you going to examine the body?

00:07:27.945 --> 00:07:29.145
Please step back.

00:08:03.945 --> 00:08:05.065
A knife was stabbed into the chest.

00:08:05.825 --> 00:08:08.025
The wound is deep enough
to spill this much blood.

00:08:20.585 --> 00:08:23.385
The killer must've hated you deeply.

00:08:23.945 --> 00:08:25.225
Who is he?

00:08:39.745 --> 00:08:41.144
This wedding robe is beautiful.

00:08:42.144 --> 00:08:43.185
Such a pity.

00:09:15.505 --> 00:09:16.665
There's the scent of black powder.

00:09:16.745 --> 00:09:17.665
Be careful.

00:09:39.665 --> 00:09:41.385
It matches the black powder
left on the stage.

00:09:41.465 --> 00:09:43.985
This house
really was the killer's hideout.

00:09:44.625 --> 00:09:47.465
From these shoe prints,
the killer must be six chi tall.

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:48.705
But there are only partial prints.

00:09:48.785 --> 00:09:50.785
We can't confirm if these prints
are left by the same person.

00:10:00.585 --> 00:10:02.185
Tomorrow, let's visit
the Right Chancellor's mansion.

00:10:02.825 --> 00:10:04.865
We need to find out
why this unmarried woman

00:10:04.945 --> 00:10:06.665
appeared here in a wedding robe.

00:10:21.785 --> 00:10:22.745
Peiyi!

00:10:26.985 --> 00:10:28.585
- Peiyi!
- Wanshun!

00:10:28.665 --> 00:10:29.585
Peiyi!

00:10:30.945 --> 00:10:32.505
WU SHUYUN, PRINCESS CONSORT OF DUAN

00:10:33.945 --> 00:10:35.145
Mother.

00:10:35.225 --> 00:10:36.305
LI JING, PRINCE OF DUAN

00:10:38.225 --> 00:10:39.145
Father.

00:10:41.585 --> 00:10:42.505
Father!

00:10:53.185 --> 00:10:55.905
PALACE INVESTIGATION BUREAU

00:11:19.865 --> 00:11:20.985
PRINCE OF DUAN'S FAMILY MASSACRE CASE FILE

00:11:21.065 --> 00:11:23.465
You're finally here.

00:11:27.265 --> 00:11:28.745
Where is the real case file?

00:11:30.745 --> 00:11:33.705
This has always been the real one.

00:11:34.225 --> 00:11:36.105
On the night of the Lantern Festival,
15 years ago,

00:11:36.185 --> 00:11:39.345
weakened from years

00:11:39.425 --> 00:11:40.705
of continuous warfare

00:11:40.785 --> 00:11:43.065
and suffering
from a long-standing illness,

00:11:43.145 --> 00:11:45.625
Prince of Duan went mad.

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:47.425
He slaughtered his entire household,

00:11:47.505 --> 00:11:49.425
then took his own life to atone.

00:11:49.505 --> 00:11:53.425
Prince of Duan's only daughter, Li Peiyi,

00:11:53.505 --> 00:11:56.625
stayed at the palace due to illness
and thus survived.

00:12:00.985 --> 00:12:03.305
It's because I lost the memory
of that day,

00:12:04.025 --> 00:12:06.225
you've all been lying to me.

00:12:06.305 --> 00:12:10.105
It's the truth. Why would we lie?

00:12:10.185 --> 00:12:13.505
That day, you had a fever
and stayed in the palace.

00:12:13.585 --> 00:12:15.105
You were unconscious
for three days and nights.

00:12:15.185 --> 00:12:16.305
When you woke up,

00:12:16.385 --> 00:12:18.665
the tragedy had already happened.

00:12:18.745 --> 00:12:20.985
It's just normal
that you don't remember it.

00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:25.025
His Majesty never wanted
to tell you about this.

00:12:25.105 --> 00:12:27.785
But you kept asking,

00:12:27.865 --> 00:12:29.865
and His Majesty
couldn't bear to withhold it.

00:12:30.745 --> 00:12:32.425
I've told you these things

00:12:32.505 --> 00:12:34.625
so many times over the years.

00:12:34.705 --> 00:12:36.385
Why don't you believe me?

00:12:36.465 --> 00:12:38.545
Because my father wouldn't lose control,

00:12:38.625 --> 00:12:40.025
and he would never kill my mother!

00:12:40.865 --> 00:12:43.225
Just because
you don't want to believe them

00:12:43.305 --> 00:12:45.025
doesn't mean they didn't happen.

00:12:45.105 --> 00:12:47.905
Peiyi, this case
has already been concluded.

00:12:48.585 --> 00:12:50.865
Instead of clinging to the past,

00:12:50.945 --> 00:12:55.225
it's better to focus
on finding the murderer of the princess.

00:13:03.825 --> 00:13:04.665
You can keep it.

00:13:19.785 --> 00:13:20.945
Your Ladyship.

00:13:21.025 --> 00:13:22.305
CUI MINZHONG, RIGHT CHANCELLOR

00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:23.785
You remind me so much of Manshu.

00:13:27.945 --> 00:13:29.225
I lost my composure.

00:13:30.945 --> 00:13:31.785
Sorry about that.

00:13:35.305 --> 00:13:37.305
No need for formalities, Sir.

00:13:37.385 --> 00:13:39.065
It's easier for me to sit here.

00:13:40.425 --> 00:13:41.265
All right.

00:13:42.785 --> 00:13:44.465
How is Consort Shu?

00:13:44.545 --> 00:13:46.025
Manshu was murdered.

00:13:47.105 --> 00:13:48.545
As Consort Shu's older brother,

00:13:49.185 --> 00:13:50.945
I'm worried about her sorrow.

00:13:52.145 --> 00:13:53.705
She is indeed heartbroken.

00:13:54.745 --> 00:13:56.225
In one night,

00:13:56.825 --> 00:13:58.465
two noble ladies lost their lives.

00:13:58.545 --> 00:14:00.305
His Majesty is furious.

00:14:00.865 --> 00:14:01.945
Consort Shu is distressed.

00:14:03.265 --> 00:14:05.385
I feel heartache and unease too.

00:14:08.745 --> 00:14:10.425
Your Ladyship and Deputy Director Xiao

00:14:10.505 --> 00:14:13.025
are so concerned about Manshu's case.

00:14:14.785 --> 00:14:16.945
I am deeply grateful.

00:14:20.625 --> 00:14:22.185
It's time for lunch.

00:14:22.905 --> 00:14:24.185
I've prepared a simple meal.

00:14:24.265 --> 00:14:25.665
Please, take your time.

00:14:25.745 --> 00:14:28.025
If you want to know anything,

00:14:29.105 --> 00:14:31.665
just question my men after the meal.

00:15:06.865 --> 00:15:07.905
ENTERING THE MANSION
HOUR OF XU, NINTH LADY CUI, TWO MAIDS

00:15:07.985 --> 00:15:09.065
Sir, please take a look.

00:15:09.145 --> 00:15:10.225
Last night during the hour of Xu,

00:15:10.305 --> 00:15:12.545
after leaving the palace,
Lady Cui returned directly to the mansion

00:15:12.625 --> 00:15:14.025
with no stops in between.

00:15:16.225 --> 00:15:18.145
After returning, did she go out again?

00:15:21.265 --> 00:15:23.705
Last night during the hour of Xu,
she returned here,

00:15:23.785 --> 00:15:25.225
but was murdered in Yanshou Ward.

00:15:25.305 --> 00:15:27.425
Yanshou Ward is far from here.

00:15:28.105 --> 00:15:30.185
If she didn't leave in a carriage,

00:15:30.705 --> 00:15:31.825
she must have

00:15:32.505 --> 00:15:35.065
been abducted and taken to Yanshou Ward.

00:15:35.985 --> 00:15:37.785
This mansion has tight security.

00:15:37.865 --> 00:15:40.745
It's impossible for someone
to forcefully abduct a lady.

00:15:43.065 --> 00:15:44.745
Whose carriage
did Lady Cui take last night?

00:15:44.825 --> 00:15:46.225
Tell me honestly!

00:15:46.305 --> 00:15:47.585
Or else, 50 lashes for each person!

00:15:49.745 --> 00:15:50.705
It was mine.

00:15:50.785 --> 00:15:52.625
I took Lady Cui to Yanshou Ward.

00:15:52.705 --> 00:15:54.185
When we arrived there,

00:15:54.265 --> 00:15:56.745
she asked me to stop the carriage
outside a house.

00:15:56.825 --> 00:15:57.705
She then got out of the carriage

00:15:57.785 --> 00:16:00.505
and told me to go straight back.

00:16:00.585 --> 00:16:03.225
Was there anyone else in that house?

00:16:05.065 --> 00:16:06.025
It was pitch dark.

00:16:06.105 --> 00:16:07.065
There should have been no one.

00:16:08.105 --> 00:16:10.865
Along the way, especially in Yanshou Ward,

00:16:10.945 --> 00:16:15.305
did you see a solitary man
about six chi tall and very sturdy?

00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:18.065
No, I didn't.

00:16:21.185 --> 00:16:23.745
What was Lady Cui wearing
when she got on the carriage?

00:16:24.665 --> 00:16:27.585
A yellow skirt, with a flowered cloak.

00:16:29.865 --> 00:16:31.825
- Did she carry any bags?
- No.

00:16:35.505 --> 00:16:38.505
These girls are too clumsy
to explain it clearly.

00:16:38.585 --> 00:16:39.865
If Your Ladyship has any questions,

00:16:39.945 --> 00:16:41.105
just ask this old servant.

00:16:41.185 --> 00:16:44.065
Do you mean Her Ladyship
can't understand them

00:16:44.145 --> 00:16:45.425
without your help?

00:16:46.945 --> 00:16:48.025
I dare not.

00:17:03.185 --> 00:17:05.985
- You served Lady Cui yesterday?
- Yes.

00:17:06.065 --> 00:17:09.585
Has she had any conflicts lately
or any secret relationships?

00:17:13.345 --> 00:17:16.105
Your Ladyship, we servants should
not gossip about the master's matters.

00:17:16.184 --> 00:17:17.825
Otherwise, we'd be
kicked out of the mansion!

00:17:17.905 --> 00:17:20.704
This is an investigation, not gossip.

00:17:27.025 --> 00:17:29.505
Your Ladyship, I really can't say it.

00:17:29.585 --> 00:17:30.705
You can't say it?

00:17:31.825 --> 00:17:33.105
That means you know something.

00:17:34.985 --> 00:17:35.985
I don't know anything.

00:17:40.225 --> 00:17:43.105
Fine. Everyone, rise up.

00:17:46.465 --> 00:17:48.225
Bring the matron in.

00:17:48.305 --> 00:17:51.265
Tell her the servants
have spilled everything.

00:17:51.345 --> 00:17:52.305
Understood.

00:17:53.785 --> 00:17:56.545
Please show mercy. Please show mercy.

00:17:57.265 --> 00:17:58.985
I truly know nothing.

00:17:59.065 --> 00:18:00.305
I really didn't say a word.

00:18:00.385 --> 00:18:02.105
If I'm kicked out,

00:18:02.185 --> 00:18:05.265
I'll have no choice but to work
in some drink shop.

00:18:05.345 --> 00:18:07.705
Then I'll truly be left with no hope.

00:18:08.305 --> 00:18:09.585
Please show mercy.

00:18:10.345 --> 00:18:12.545
Please, Your Ladyship, be merciful.

00:18:21.385 --> 00:18:24.105
WUXIANG DRINK SHOP

00:18:24.185 --> 00:18:26.225
UNFILTERED SPRING BREW
CARE FOR A TASTE?

00:18:28.065 --> 00:18:29.145
I found it.

00:18:29.225 --> 00:18:30.265
That house was originally owned

00:18:30.345 --> 00:18:32.465
by a concubine's son
from a wealthy local family.

00:18:32.545 --> 00:18:34.705
He died young,
and the house was left vacant.

00:18:34.785 --> 00:18:35.785
No one dared live there.

00:18:35.865 --> 00:18:37.985
Later, it was sold
to a merchant from the north.

00:18:38.065 --> 00:18:39.745
I finally found this merchant.

00:18:39.825 --> 00:18:43.545
He said he had rented the house
to a gentleman

00:18:43.625 --> 00:18:46.025
named Guo Hua.

00:18:46.105 --> 00:18:47.425
Then, did you find Guo Hua?

00:18:47.505 --> 00:18:49.185
No. However,

00:18:50.745 --> 00:18:52.745
I got the lease from the merchant.

00:18:58.745 --> 00:19:01.345
Didn't you order any drinks?

00:19:04.025 --> 00:19:04.905
We've been waiting for you.

00:19:05.825 --> 00:19:06.665
You're so kind.

00:19:07.505 --> 00:19:09.345
Lady, please bring me a bowl of drink.

00:19:09.865 --> 00:19:10.785
Alright.

00:19:12.865 --> 00:19:14.425
Servants
from the Right Chancellor's mansion

00:19:14.505 --> 00:19:15.705
asked me to question you.

00:19:17.865 --> 00:19:20.425
Lady Cui is dead.

00:19:24.265 --> 00:19:25.105
Please sit.

00:19:30.185 --> 00:19:31.185
How did she die?

00:19:31.265 --> 00:19:32.545
She was murdered.

00:19:34.945 --> 00:19:36.465
Heaven is just.

00:19:36.545 --> 00:19:38.105
She truly got what she deserved.

00:19:43.665 --> 00:19:45.225
I'm Li Niang.

00:19:45.305 --> 00:19:49.305
She's the reason my face looks like this.

00:19:59.305 --> 00:20:00.705
You ruined this luxurious embroidery!

00:20:01.345 --> 00:20:03.905
You're not worth a single thread of it!

00:20:04.825 --> 00:20:06.545
Speak!

00:20:07.625 --> 00:20:08.465
When…

00:20:09.065 --> 00:20:11.265
When I was ironing, I accidentally--

00:20:13.305 --> 00:20:16.345
Then you covered it
with two yellow silk threads.

00:20:16.425 --> 00:20:18.745
And you thought I wouldn't notice, huh?

00:20:20.665 --> 00:20:22.825
Since you're so clumsy,

00:20:22.905 --> 00:20:24.785
I'll teach you properly.

00:20:25.505 --> 00:20:27.065
- Young lady!
- What are you doing?

00:20:27.145 --> 00:20:28.105
- Please, spare me!
- Let go!

00:20:28.185 --> 00:20:29.145
Don't just stand there!

00:20:29.225 --> 00:20:31.465
- Come here and hold her down! Hurry!
- Please!

00:20:31.545 --> 00:20:33.025
Please, young lady, spare me!

00:20:33.105 --> 00:20:34.345
- Please, young lady…
- Let go!

00:20:34.425 --> 00:20:36.505
- Spare me!
- Hold her down! Hold her down!

00:20:36.585 --> 00:20:38.905
At least a donkey can grind grain for me.

00:20:38.985 --> 00:20:40.465
With you lot,

00:20:40.545 --> 00:20:43.465
I doubt I'll ever get a decent robe made.

00:20:45.785 --> 00:20:46.785
So inhuman!

00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:52.745
I wish I were the killer.

00:20:53.265 --> 00:20:55.745
But so many want her dead.

00:20:55.825 --> 00:20:56.665
It's not my turn.

00:20:57.385 --> 00:20:58.825
Heaven's justice is clear.

00:20:58.905 --> 00:21:01.345
Her wealthy friends' days

00:21:01.425 --> 00:21:03.425
are surely numbered too.

00:21:04.585 --> 00:21:06.745
Life is really getting
more hopeful for me.

00:21:07.425 --> 00:21:10.105
With her kind of character,
it's no surprise she made enemies.

00:21:10.185 --> 00:21:11.545
But how did she make friends?

00:21:11.625 --> 00:21:13.305
Like attracts like.

00:21:14.105 --> 00:21:14.945
Who are they?

00:21:16.585 --> 00:21:17.785
‪Shh.

00:21:30.385 --> 00:21:32.905
ZHOU HELAN, ZHAO LUOSHUN

00:21:34.785 --> 00:21:36.105
WANG YUHUA

00:21:40.745 --> 00:21:41.865
Well…

00:21:43.585 --> 00:21:45.305
they're all high-status noble ladies.

00:21:47.425 --> 00:21:49.585
Has Lady Cui
mentioned the Fifteenth Princess?

00:21:51.185 --> 00:21:52.345
Of course, she has.

00:21:52.865 --> 00:21:54.745
Lady Cui is arrogant and overbearing,

00:21:54.825 --> 00:21:56.025
bullying so many people.

00:21:56.105 --> 00:21:58.985
Only the Fifteenth Princess
made her suffer.

00:21:59.065 --> 00:22:01.745
So, when she talks about the Princess,

00:22:01.825 --> 00:22:02.905
she grits her teeth.

00:22:02.985 --> 00:22:04.185
What happened?

00:22:06.425 --> 00:22:07.465
I only heard

00:22:07.545 --> 00:22:10.105
that Lady Cui bullied others

00:22:10.185 --> 00:22:12.345
and was punished by the Princess.

00:22:12.425 --> 00:22:15.105
But no one dares say

00:22:15.705 --> 00:22:17.785
exactly what happened.

00:22:17.865 --> 00:22:19.705
All these years,

00:22:19.785 --> 00:22:23.545
someone finally punished this evil lady.

00:22:24.785 --> 00:22:27.425
The Princess will certainly be blessed.

00:22:29.345 --> 00:22:30.825
She deserves every blessing.

00:22:31.425 --> 00:22:33.705
If there's no solid evidence,

00:22:33.785 --> 00:22:34.705
hastily interrogating these three people

00:22:34.785 --> 00:22:35.945
in the name
of the Court of Judicial Review

00:22:36.025 --> 00:22:37.225
may be difficult.

00:22:37.305 --> 00:22:39.785
Powerful families
generally care about their reputation.

00:22:39.865 --> 00:22:42.225
If we act rashly,
it will not look good for either side.

00:22:44.185 --> 00:22:46.145
Yunchui House makes excellent cured meat.

00:22:46.225 --> 00:22:48.665
Wuren, book three fine rooms there.

00:22:48.745 --> 00:22:50.025
I'll join you shortly.

00:22:52.745 --> 00:22:54.865
Why has she suddenly taken
an interest in cured meat?

00:22:54.945 --> 00:22:56.785
She means that in her name,

00:22:56.865 --> 00:22:58.065
she will invite the three noble ladies

00:22:58.145 --> 00:23:00.585
to meet at Yunchui House
under the pretense of casual conversation.

00:23:00.665 --> 00:23:02.185
Keep it low-key and dignified.

00:23:02.265 --> 00:23:03.545
That way, perhaps
it will stir up less trouble.

00:23:05.985 --> 00:23:07.665
So, where are you going?

00:23:07.745 --> 00:23:11.745
The killer could openly bring black powder
into the palace without being noticed.

00:23:11.825 --> 00:23:13.585
They must have some skill.
I'll go check it out.

00:23:13.665 --> 00:23:18.305
YUNCHUI HOUSE

00:23:26.665 --> 00:23:29.745
ZHAO LUOSHUN, NOBLE LADY

00:23:42.705 --> 00:23:46.385
ZHOU HELAN, NOBLE LADY

00:23:49.065 --> 00:23:50.705
The Minister's mansion
has eyes everywhere.

00:23:50.785 --> 00:23:52.265
Her Ladyship is worried
that going there hastily

00:23:52.345 --> 00:23:53.625
would cause unnecessary gossip about you.

00:23:53.705 --> 00:23:55.065
WANG YUHUA, NOBLE LADY

00:23:55.145 --> 00:23:56.705
The Right Chancellor's mansion urged me.

00:23:56.785 --> 00:23:58.385
How could I dare stay at home any longer?

00:24:05.825 --> 00:24:06.985
So many dishes.

00:24:12.345 --> 00:24:13.185
This cured meat is quite good.

00:24:13.265 --> 00:24:15.625
Did you meet with Lady Cui last night?

00:24:17.345 --> 00:24:19.745
Her Ladyship asked me here to talk,

00:24:20.345 --> 00:24:21.505
and now you're questioning me?

00:24:22.225 --> 00:24:24.065
Why are you being so difficult?

00:24:24.145 --> 00:24:25.345
It's such a simple question.

00:24:25.425 --> 00:24:26.745
Just answer it.

00:24:27.425 --> 00:24:29.545
Yesterday, my mother was unwell.

00:24:29.625 --> 00:24:31.465
She insisted I stay at home with her.

00:24:31.545 --> 00:24:32.625
With such festivities out there,

00:24:32.705 --> 00:24:34.425
she wouldn't let
any women in the house leave.

00:24:35.025 --> 00:24:36.985
I never even caught a glimpse
of the palace lanterns.

00:24:37.065 --> 00:24:38.585
How could I have seen Manshu?

00:24:41.185 --> 00:24:42.945
Do you know

00:24:43.025 --> 00:24:44.945
why Lady Cui went to Yanshou Ward?

00:24:45.025 --> 00:24:46.985
Did she ever mention it to you before?

00:24:48.265 --> 00:24:50.265
The noble ladies
on the west side of the city all say

00:24:50.345 --> 00:24:52.705
that stepping westward from Zhuque Street

00:24:52.785 --> 00:24:54.625
makes you lose some of your noble air.

00:24:54.705 --> 00:24:57.865
Let alone Yanshou Ward,
a place full of scoundrels.

00:24:57.945 --> 00:24:59.185
Manshu would never go there.

00:24:59.265 --> 00:25:01.265
Do you know

00:25:01.345 --> 00:25:03.545
the issue between her
and the Fifteenth Princess?

00:25:05.065 --> 00:25:07.225
No, I don't. Didn't Helan come here too?

00:25:07.865 --> 00:25:09.185
Go ask her.

00:25:09.265 --> 00:25:10.465
She is the closest to Manshu.

00:25:10.545 --> 00:25:13.545
There are things
Manshu would never tell us,

00:25:13.625 --> 00:25:14.625
but Helan knows all about them.

00:25:30.265 --> 00:25:31.505
You're wearing a storax sachet.

00:25:32.705 --> 00:25:33.745
It smells wonderful.

00:25:43.545 --> 00:25:45.265
Daily supplies are brought

00:25:45.345 --> 00:25:48.105
into the palace
at the precise hour of Yin.

00:25:48.785 --> 00:25:50.945
These past few days,

00:25:51.025 --> 00:25:52.105
besides the daily supplies,

00:25:52.185 --> 00:25:55.625
the palace also received gifts
from the Uyghur prince,

00:25:55.705 --> 00:25:59.025
as well as the New Year tribute
to Consort Shu

00:25:59.105 --> 00:26:01.105
from the Right Chancellor
and the Armory Director.

00:26:03.025 --> 00:26:04.025
TWO CARTS OF GOODS, THREE HORSES
THE DRIVER: ZHOU HELAN

00:26:04.105 --> 00:26:04.945
Lady Zhou?

00:26:05.585 --> 00:26:08.105
Does the Armory Director send gifts
to Consort Shu every festival?

00:26:08.745 --> 00:26:11.745
Before, he'd only send a cart
for her birthday.

00:26:12.385 --> 00:26:14.265
The New Year tribute is new this year.

00:26:14.345 --> 00:26:16.865
What's more,
it was a total of three carts.

00:26:21.745 --> 00:26:24.225
Cui Manshu's murder has nothing
to do with me.

00:26:24.305 --> 00:26:25.145
I'm going home.

00:26:26.665 --> 00:26:28.705
Aren't you close friends?

00:26:31.625 --> 00:26:32.745
She is the Right Chancellor's niece.

00:26:32.825 --> 00:26:33.825
Everyone revolves around her.

00:26:33.905 --> 00:26:36.785
I'm just a general's daughter
who enjoys swinging swords.

00:26:36.865 --> 00:26:37.705
We're nothing alike.

00:26:38.305 --> 00:26:40.505
Your father relies
on the Right Chancellor's favor.

00:26:40.585 --> 00:26:42.505
As his daughter, it's understandable

00:26:42.585 --> 00:26:45.305
you'd try to keep good relations
with Lady Cui.

00:26:45.385 --> 00:26:46.425
There's no shame in that.

00:26:47.145 --> 00:26:48.985
Even Wang Yuhua says

00:26:49.065 --> 00:26:50.665
that you and Cui Manshu are the closest.

00:26:51.265 --> 00:26:53.025
You two share so many confidences.

00:26:53.825 --> 00:26:56.105
I always thought
you were clever and sharp.

00:26:56.185 --> 00:26:58.705
I never expected you to be so ordinary.

00:26:59.825 --> 00:27:01.545
No point in saying more.
I'll take my leave.

00:27:08.345 --> 00:27:11.385
Bossed around by Cui Manshu,
you've let your training slip.

00:27:20.425 --> 00:27:22.745
Consort Shu gave you storax sachets.

00:27:22.825 --> 00:27:25.425
Wang Yuhua and Zhao Luoshun both got one,

00:27:25.505 --> 00:27:26.785
yet you were left out.

00:27:27.705 --> 00:27:29.065
Cui Manshu has always been arrogant,

00:27:29.145 --> 00:27:32.305
never associating with daughters
of officials below the fourth rank.

00:27:32.385 --> 00:27:33.745
You won't admit your association with her

00:27:33.825 --> 00:27:37.345
because she only bullies you
and doesn't offer friendship.

00:27:39.985 --> 00:27:40.905
You're right.

00:27:41.625 --> 00:27:43.025
Cui Manshu has always been showy

00:27:43.105 --> 00:27:45.265
- and enjoys bullying the weak.
- Of course.

00:27:45.345 --> 00:27:46.865
- I never wanted to get involved with her.
- Take it.

00:27:47.665 --> 00:27:48.905
But one day,

00:27:48.985 --> 00:27:50.825
my father came back
from the Right Chancellor's mansion,

00:27:51.785 --> 00:27:53.225
drunk and out of his mind.

00:27:54.145 --> 00:27:55.625
I later found out

00:27:55.705 --> 00:27:58.105
that the Right Chancellor
had heard that I was arrogant

00:27:58.185 --> 00:27:59.465
and unwilling to associate with Lady Cui,

00:27:59.545 --> 00:28:01.625
which caused her to cry and complain.

00:28:02.465 --> 00:28:04.105
He asked my father

00:28:04.185 --> 00:28:06.265
to resolve
the misunderstanding at his house.

00:28:06.345 --> 00:28:08.065
But there was no misunderstanding at all.

00:28:08.145 --> 00:28:10.385
He just wanted my father
to make a public statement

00:28:10.465 --> 00:28:11.665
and teach me a lesson

00:28:11.745 --> 00:28:14.865
to live in harmony as close friends.

00:28:16.025 --> 00:28:18.145
That night, my father kept apologizing,

00:28:18.225 --> 00:28:19.345
until he was coughing up blood.

00:28:20.145 --> 00:28:21.345
He didn't want me to suffer.

00:28:21.985 --> 00:28:23.585
But my mother couldn't bear it.

00:28:23.665 --> 00:28:27.545
For the peace of our family,
she begged me to play along

00:28:27.625 --> 00:28:29.225
and be friends with Cui Manshu.

00:28:31.665 --> 00:28:32.865
What are you doing there?

00:28:32.945 --> 00:28:34.385
Pour us some water!

00:28:35.305 --> 00:28:36.545
And bring the pastries over.

00:28:36.625 --> 00:28:38.705
She doesn't need me to be her friend.

00:28:39.905 --> 00:28:42.785
She just wants me there to humiliate me.

00:28:43.385 --> 00:28:45.905
For my father's sake, I had no choice.

00:28:47.065 --> 00:28:49.065
I just never thought

00:28:49.145 --> 00:28:52.625
she'd resent me so much
just because I didn't put on a smile

00:28:52.705 --> 00:28:54.785
when she was humiliating me.

00:28:55.785 --> 00:28:56.745
That day,

00:28:56.825 --> 00:28:59.065
it was Cui Manshu's birthday.

00:28:59.145 --> 00:29:03.305
My mother had custom-made
a crimson fox fur cloak

00:29:03.385 --> 00:29:04.785
as a gift to her.

00:29:04.865 --> 00:29:07.625
My lady, crimson fox fur is quite rare.

00:29:07.705 --> 00:29:08.745
Helan searched far and wide

00:29:08.825 --> 00:29:10.305
to gather enough to make this cloak.

00:29:10.385 --> 00:29:13.185
May it bring you prosperity.

00:29:16.425 --> 00:29:17.585
Madam Zhou,

00:29:17.665 --> 00:29:20.785
this fur collar feels so soft.

00:29:22.345 --> 00:29:23.665
You certainly know quality!

00:29:23.745 --> 00:29:25.425
It took quite some gathering.

00:29:25.505 --> 00:29:27.105
The fur is taken

00:29:27.185 --> 00:29:29.065
from under the arms of foxes
barely a year old--

00:29:29.145 --> 00:29:30.065
How dare you!

00:29:30.145 --> 00:29:32.225
Cui Manshu, what are you doing?

00:29:33.745 --> 00:29:35.705
On my birthday,

00:29:35.785 --> 00:29:38.225
you skinned a fox and plucked its fur
to celebrate for me?

00:29:39.665 --> 00:29:40.705
Don't you know

00:29:40.785 --> 00:29:44.905
Consort Shu and the Right Chancellor's
maternal family's surname is Hu?

00:29:45.825 --> 00:29:47.025
Fox reads the same as Hu.
Such a deathtrap,

00:29:47.625 --> 00:29:48.625
you deserve major punishment!

00:29:48.705 --> 00:29:50.545
Don't start it!

00:29:51.905 --> 00:29:53.985
My lady, I didn't mean any harm.

00:29:54.065 --> 00:29:56.625
We can't take on this accusation.

00:29:57.385 --> 00:29:59.265
If it weren't
for my friendship with Helan,

00:29:59.345 --> 00:30:01.785
I would have made
this matter known to Consort Shu.

00:30:01.865 --> 00:30:03.905
That's a crime punishable by death.

00:30:04.705 --> 00:30:06.665
My lady, punish me however you wish.

00:30:07.265 --> 00:30:10.625
Just don't let Consort Shu
or the Right Chancellor find out.

00:30:10.705 --> 00:30:13.025
You'll take whatever punishment?

00:30:13.105 --> 00:30:15.505
- Y-Yes.
- Fine.

00:30:17.265 --> 00:30:21.105
Then kneel to my family shrine

00:30:21.185 --> 00:30:22.185
and kowtow 100 times.

00:30:23.465 --> 00:30:25.705
We should only kneel to heaven and earth,
to our parents.

00:30:25.785 --> 00:30:27.505
Why should we kneel to your family shrine?

00:30:29.145 --> 00:30:29.985
So, you refuse?

00:30:30.985 --> 00:30:33.025
- Fine.
- My lady…

00:30:34.545 --> 00:30:36.545
Fine. I'm willing to kneel.

00:30:36.625 --> 00:30:38.985
I hope you will let it go

00:30:39.865 --> 00:30:40.825
and don't hold it against us.

00:30:45.105 --> 00:30:46.785
Whatever you want, come at me.

00:30:46.865 --> 00:30:47.865
Don't make things hard for my mother!

00:30:47.945 --> 00:30:50.025
After all, she is your elder.

00:30:50.105 --> 00:30:52.865
I'll kneel for her, 200 times.

00:30:52.945 --> 00:30:53.905
I'll kneel to your family,

00:30:53.985 --> 00:30:56.465
wishing your family happiness every year

00:30:57.185 --> 00:30:58.025
and a bright future.

00:31:00.865 --> 00:31:02.265
Helan…

00:31:17.825 --> 00:31:20.825
Cui Manshu often takes pleasure
in humiliating others.

00:31:20.905 --> 00:31:24.385
I heard that the Fifteenth Princess
once taught her a lesson for this,

00:31:24.985 --> 00:31:26.545
making her lose face in public.

00:31:27.345 --> 00:31:28.385
Do you know the details?

00:31:29.225 --> 00:31:30.065
No, I don't.

00:31:31.545 --> 00:31:33.305
It seems not many people know about it.

00:31:34.865 --> 00:31:38.265
Do you know why Cui Manshu
went to Yanshou Ward last night?

00:31:38.825 --> 00:31:39.665
No, I don't.

00:31:43.745 --> 00:31:46.025
- Give me your hand.
- What?

00:31:47.025 --> 00:31:48.985
You, unlucky in relationships,

00:31:49.065 --> 00:31:50.905
have been bullied
and tormented by Cui Manshu.

00:31:51.745 --> 00:31:52.865
Let me see

00:31:52.945 --> 00:31:55.425
when you'll meet someone
who will bring you luck.

00:31:56.185 --> 00:31:57.305
You can read palms?

00:31:58.625 --> 00:31:59.545
I have many talents.

00:31:59.625 --> 00:32:01.025
TWO CARTS OF GOODS
TWO HORSES, THE DRIVER: ZHOU HELAN

00:32:02.265 --> 00:32:03.665
On the tenth day of the month,

00:32:03.745 --> 00:32:05.785
Zhou family only sent two carts
of New Year tribute?

00:32:06.625 --> 00:32:09.185
One person records these entries,

00:32:09.265 --> 00:32:11.705
one person checks them,
and another person verifies them.

00:32:11.785 --> 00:32:13.065
There won't be any mistakes.

00:32:14.545 --> 00:32:16.585
This line is called
the "official-ghost line."

00:32:16.665 --> 00:32:19.305
Where fortune hides misfortune,
within danger lies grace.

00:32:19.385 --> 00:32:21.945
A life near nobility,
yet bound to trouble.

00:32:23.065 --> 00:32:25.385
So what if I know my fate beforehand?

00:32:25.465 --> 00:32:26.985
I still have to live it out.

00:32:27.065 --> 00:32:27.905
No need to read it.

00:32:27.985 --> 00:32:29.425
I haven't finished yet.

00:32:31.785 --> 00:32:32.785
Helan,

00:32:33.385 --> 00:32:36.065
you're still holding grudges
against Cui Manshu,

00:32:36.145 --> 00:32:38.545
with secrets buried deep in your heart.

00:32:38.625 --> 00:32:40.065
Nonsense!

00:32:41.065 --> 00:32:41.905
I won't let you fool around.

00:32:42.745 --> 00:32:43.665
I'm going home.

00:32:47.625 --> 00:32:48.545
From the beginning,

00:32:48.625 --> 00:32:51.025
you've been trying
to distance yourself from Cui Manshu.

00:32:51.105 --> 00:32:54.265
I know you've been bullied by her,
ashamed to speak about it.

00:32:55.145 --> 00:32:57.145
But the truth is,
it's very easy to see through it.

00:32:57.945 --> 00:33:00.345
The real reason you distanced yourself

00:33:00.425 --> 00:33:03.105
is to hide something
that is unfavorable to you.

00:33:04.265 --> 00:33:05.545
I gave you a chance.

00:33:05.625 --> 00:33:07.945
You didn't spill,
so I had to read your hand.

00:33:08.705 --> 00:33:10.025
Can a hand reveal anything?

00:33:10.105 --> 00:33:11.545
Of course, it can.

00:33:14.945 --> 00:33:15.985
On this lease,

00:33:16.665 --> 00:33:18.585
the fingerprint
of Guo Hua's right index finger

00:33:18.665 --> 00:33:19.745
is an inverted shape.

00:33:19.825 --> 00:33:21.665
Your right index finger
also bears the same shape.

00:33:23.065 --> 00:33:24.305
WANG BOWEN, GUO HUA, DOU LUHONG

00:33:24.385 --> 00:33:26.385
The house in Yanshou Ward
is rented by you.

00:33:26.465 --> 00:33:27.305
Why didn't you admit it?

00:33:28.145 --> 00:33:31.105
A fingerprint can't prove it's me.

00:33:31.705 --> 00:33:33.265
Fingerprints are unique.

00:33:33.345 --> 00:33:35.665
A fingerprint like yours
is one in a million.

00:33:37.025 --> 00:33:38.865
If you don't want to admit it, fine.

00:33:38.945 --> 00:33:42.105
Wuren, go and find that merchant.

00:33:42.185 --> 00:33:44.305
Let him meet this gentleman,

00:33:44.385 --> 00:33:45.905
- Guo Hua.
- Understood.

00:33:45.985 --> 00:33:47.345
Wait.

00:33:48.065 --> 00:33:49.545
So what if I rented it?

00:33:51.505 --> 00:33:53.545
Cui Manshu's death
has nothing to do with me.

00:33:54.145 --> 00:33:55.465
After I returned home last night,

00:33:55.545 --> 00:33:57.425
I practiced swordsmanship
with my father until midnight.

00:33:57.505 --> 00:33:59.305
The Zhou family can testify for me.

00:34:00.985 --> 00:34:03.465
Even if you're not involved
in Cui Manshu's death,

00:34:04.145 --> 00:34:05.425
what about the Fifteenth Princess's death?

00:34:06.905 --> 00:34:08.824
I checked the palace records
for this month's entries.

00:34:08.905 --> 00:34:09.985
On the tenth,

00:34:10.065 --> 00:34:12.344
the Zhou family sent three carts
of New Year tribute to Consort Shu.

00:34:12.425 --> 00:34:14.225
But in Consort Shu's
storage record that day,

00:34:14.304 --> 00:34:15.145
only two carts were logged.

00:34:15.744 --> 00:34:16.784
One cart of goods

00:34:16.865 --> 00:34:19.665
disappeared between the palace gates
and Consort Shu's palace.

00:34:19.744 --> 00:34:22.185
Coincidentally, someone saw you

00:34:22.264 --> 00:34:24.145
escorting a cart of goods
to the side door.

00:34:24.225 --> 00:34:27.264
As for whether the cart contained
black powder,

00:34:27.344 --> 00:34:29.344
the Inner Guards will find out soon.

00:34:32.225 --> 00:34:33.065
No need.

00:34:34.705 --> 00:34:35.945
I'm indeed involved

00:34:37.425 --> 00:34:38.784
in the Fifteenth Princess's death.

00:34:47.705 --> 00:34:49.145
Cui Manshu

00:34:49.824 --> 00:34:51.945
and the Fifteenth Princess had a grudge

00:34:53.264 --> 00:34:55.744
on the day my mother and I
were humiliated.

00:34:55.824 --> 00:34:57.385
Faster.

00:34:57.465 --> 00:35:00.025
Don't delay my birthday banquet.
It's about to begin.

00:35:03.105 --> 00:35:04.305
Wait a moment!

00:35:08.065 --> 00:35:09.385
Your Highness is here.

00:35:09.465 --> 00:35:10.545
Stand up.

00:35:22.145 --> 00:35:24.025
These green plums are freshly picked.

00:35:24.105 --> 00:35:26.505
You treated us to some earlier.

00:35:27.145 --> 00:35:29.025
His Majesty and Consort Shu both like it.

00:35:29.105 --> 00:35:31.425
But His Majesty never asked
what's your purpose

00:35:31.505 --> 00:35:33.585
in serving plums, as his surname Li
reads the same as plums.

00:35:36.825 --> 00:35:39.745
Your loyalty is clear for all to see.

00:35:40.505 --> 00:35:42.345
But since the Emperor has been so lenient,

00:35:43.105 --> 00:35:44.385
please show mercy.

00:35:46.585 --> 00:35:48.945
Since Her Highness pleaded for you,

00:35:49.905 --> 00:35:51.545
I'll let you off this time.

00:35:57.745 --> 00:35:58.825
What are you staring at?

00:35:58.905 --> 00:35:59.945
Why aren't you starting the banquet?

00:36:01.785 --> 00:36:03.305
You foolish thing!

00:36:09.625 --> 00:36:11.545
Take your mother back to get cleaned up.

00:36:11.625 --> 00:36:13.145
You're all tired today.

00:36:13.225 --> 00:36:14.785
Go back and rest early.

00:36:16.345 --> 00:36:18.505
The Princess saved us both

00:36:18.585 --> 00:36:20.145
and gave Cui Manshu face.

00:36:20.225 --> 00:36:23.225
But Cui Manshu
sees her as a thorn in her side.

00:36:24.305 --> 00:36:26.025
Cui continues to humiliate me

00:36:26.585 --> 00:36:29.305
while plotting revenge
against the Princess.

00:36:30.385 --> 00:36:31.465
One day,

00:36:31.545 --> 00:36:34.305
she seemed to learn
some secrets about the Princess.

00:36:35.105 --> 00:36:36.065
Every few days,

00:36:36.145 --> 00:36:37.585
- she'd secretly discuss
- Who'd thought

00:36:37.665 --> 00:36:40.265
- with Lady Wang and Lady Zhao.
- the Fifteenth Princess actually did it!

00:36:41.665 --> 00:36:43.065
If word gets out…

00:36:53.105 --> 00:36:55.625
Go pick some fresh flowers
from the courtyard.

00:36:55.705 --> 00:36:57.145
The flowers in this room have withered.

00:36:59.545 --> 00:37:02.185
They never included me
in those conversations.

00:37:03.305 --> 00:37:04.745
But once,

00:37:04.825 --> 00:37:06.385
she suddenly told me

00:37:06.465 --> 00:37:08.825
that the Princess was going
to have some great joy,

00:37:08.905 --> 00:37:10.505
and I should go and congratulate her.

00:37:10.585 --> 00:37:12.185
A few days later,

00:37:12.705 --> 00:37:14.345
the news spread that the Princess

00:37:15.505 --> 00:37:17.345
was going to marry the Uyghur prince.

00:37:17.945 --> 00:37:20.105
So, Cui Manshu made Wanshun marry off?

00:37:20.985 --> 00:37:23.945
Zhou Helan, since you knew about this,
why didn't you tell me?

00:37:24.025 --> 00:37:26.105
- I…
- Go on.

00:37:33.905 --> 00:37:35.785
After I learned about this,

00:37:36.865 --> 00:37:38.065
I prayed day and night,

00:37:38.665 --> 00:37:40.145
hoping the Princess

00:37:40.225 --> 00:37:42.585
to marry a good man
and stay away from conflict.

00:37:42.665 --> 00:37:43.785
But at the end of last month,

00:37:43.865 --> 00:37:47.385
Cui Manshu suddenly asked me
to rent a house for her.

00:37:49.465 --> 00:37:52.465
I learned that on the winter solstice,
she met with the Princess.

00:37:52.545 --> 00:37:55.265
Although I don't know
what exactly they talked about,

00:37:56.065 --> 00:37:56.985
it seemed

00:37:58.305 --> 00:37:59.745
the Princess wanted
to speak with the Emperor.

00:38:13.425 --> 00:38:15.705
I was worried about being implicated,

00:38:17.145 --> 00:38:19.065
so I followed Cui Manshu's orders,

00:38:19.945 --> 00:38:21.065
dressing as a man,

00:38:21.145 --> 00:38:23.825
using a fake name,
and renting a secluded house

00:38:23.905 --> 00:38:25.625
in Yanshou Ward.

00:38:26.265 --> 00:38:27.625
On the tenth of this month,

00:38:27.705 --> 00:38:29.505
my father and mother
were particularly happy,

00:38:30.345 --> 00:38:33.065
saying it was a rare chance
to meet Consort Shu.

00:38:33.665 --> 00:38:36.265
They asked me to present
the New Year tribute to her.

00:38:36.345 --> 00:38:37.945
My father and mother

00:38:38.025 --> 00:38:39.945
prepared two full carts
of New Year tribute.

00:38:40.665 --> 00:38:42.745
But when I was about to enter the palace,

00:38:42.825 --> 00:38:46.145
Cui Manshu suddenly told me
to send one cart of things

00:38:46.225 --> 00:38:47.265
to the side gate of the palace.

00:38:47.345 --> 00:38:48.905
She wouldn't even let me check it.

00:38:50.025 --> 00:38:51.665
I dared not check or ask.

00:38:52.705 --> 00:38:53.705
I just had to do as she said.

00:38:54.825 --> 00:38:57.905
But after I entered the palace,
I became more and more afraid.

00:38:57.985 --> 00:38:59.145
So, I secretly checked it.

00:39:01.705 --> 00:39:02.545
It was black powder.

00:39:04.705 --> 00:39:06.425
But you didn't know
what that black powder was meant for.

00:39:08.425 --> 00:39:09.865
What good could she do with it?

00:39:11.945 --> 00:39:13.345
But it was too late.

00:39:13.985 --> 00:39:17.665
It was recorded as my family's cart.

00:39:18.825 --> 00:39:20.265
Though I was scared,

00:39:21.425 --> 00:39:22.905
I didn't dare ask more questions.

00:39:25.745 --> 00:39:27.505
Then, on the night
of the Lantern Festival…

00:39:38.105 --> 00:39:39.465
I was horrified.

00:39:40.105 --> 00:39:41.545
That's when I realized

00:39:41.625 --> 00:39:43.865
why she had me brought in
the black powder.

00:39:43.945 --> 00:39:46.945
I asked her if she was behind that.

00:39:47.025 --> 00:39:49.665
She dared to kill even the Princess!
She's completely crazy!

00:39:50.705 --> 00:39:51.865
But she actually told me…

00:39:53.585 --> 00:39:55.865
This death was a mercy to her.

00:39:57.745 --> 00:40:00.345
So, you had the chance to stop all this,

00:40:01.065 --> 00:40:04.265
but you did nothing. Is that so?

00:40:05.465 --> 00:40:06.585
I didn't dare.

00:40:07.505 --> 00:40:09.105
I've been bullied for so long.

00:40:10.745 --> 00:40:13.345
I didn't know how to fight back.

00:40:13.425 --> 00:40:16.385
You're putting on the face of a victim,
playing along with me.

00:40:17.065 --> 00:40:19.625
But you know full well
that you were aiding evil.

00:40:19.705 --> 00:40:23.105
You know that black powder
could take someone's life.

00:40:23.185 --> 00:40:25.825
As long as that life isn't yours
or your father's or mother's,

00:40:25.905 --> 00:40:27.705
it's of no concern to you, right?

00:40:27.785 --> 00:40:28.825
What else could I do?

00:40:29.545 --> 00:40:31.585
Do you want me to die for the Princess?

00:40:31.665 --> 00:40:33.745
Do you want me to watch helplessly

00:40:33.825 --> 00:40:35.985
as my father and mother
are humiliated by others?

00:40:36.065 --> 00:40:38.465
You've never suffered this kind of insult.

00:40:38.545 --> 00:40:41.985
As a county princess, favored
by the Emperor and Consort Shu,

00:40:42.065 --> 00:40:43.465
naturally you'd never
be humiliated by anyone.

00:40:43.545 --> 00:40:45.385
You have no father, no mother,
so you wouldn't know

00:40:46.105 --> 00:40:48.625
what it feels like to have your parents

00:40:50.625 --> 00:40:51.545
in someone else's hands.

00:40:51.625 --> 00:40:53.065
That's too much!

00:40:56.865 --> 00:40:58.265
Ungrateful!

00:40:59.785 --> 00:41:01.345
Wanshun saved the wrong person.

00:41:01.425 --> 00:41:02.825
Say whatever you like.

00:41:04.345 --> 00:41:06.985
I was ungrateful, helping evil succeed.

00:41:07.065 --> 00:41:09.545
Anyway, I wouldn't die
at Cui Manshu's hands.

00:41:09.625 --> 00:41:12.865
Now you can take me
to the Ministry of Justice,

00:41:12.945 --> 00:41:14.385
chop me up, I'll accept it!

00:41:14.465 --> 00:41:16.185
- No need for all that trouble!
- Your Ladyship, calm down!

00:41:21.945 --> 00:41:23.425
Why did Cui Manshu
show up at Yanshou Ward?

00:41:24.985 --> 00:41:26.185
I don't know.

00:41:26.865 --> 00:41:29.465
I only rented the house for her.

00:41:29.545 --> 00:41:30.785
I've never been there.

00:41:30.865 --> 00:41:32.945
The black powder you brought in alone

00:41:33.025 --> 00:41:35.225
couldn't possibly kill the Princess
at the banquet.

00:41:37.025 --> 00:41:38.625
You must have had an accomplice.

00:41:39.225 --> 00:41:40.065
Who is it?

00:41:43.665 --> 00:41:45.545
Cui Manshu wouldn't let her know.

00:42:24.265 --> 00:42:25.385
Your Ladyship…

00:42:26.465 --> 00:42:28.465
I'm sorry for the Fifteenth Princess.

00:42:29.105 --> 00:42:32.185
Please blame me alone.

00:42:33.145 --> 00:42:34.905
Don't drag my parents into it.

00:42:52.745 --> 00:42:54.185
Your Ladyship!

00:42:54.265 --> 00:42:55.705
Lady Wang and Lady Zhao
suddenly started vomiting blood!

00:42:59.025 --> 00:43:00.865
Go to Zhao Luoshun's place.
Give her the pills.

00:43:00.945 --> 00:43:02.305
Prick Shaoshang and Zhongchong
on the right hand

00:43:02.385 --> 00:43:03.825
- and squeeze out the toxic blood. Hurry!
- Understood.

00:43:23.465 --> 00:43:24.545
It's too late.

00:43:33.065 --> 00:43:35.425
The sauce is poisoned.
It's raw aconite toxin.

00:43:36.025 --> 00:43:36.865
Seal the shop.

00:43:36.945 --> 00:43:38.625
Anyone who's touched this food,
arrest them all.

00:43:38.705 --> 00:43:39.745
Understood.

00:43:41.225 --> 00:43:44.545
Your Ladyship just ate these dishes
with Lady Wang.

00:43:44.625 --> 00:43:46.105
She didn't eat the sashimi.

00:43:46.185 --> 00:43:47.425
Her cup was very clean.

00:43:47.505 --> 00:43:49.185
There was no sauce in it.

00:43:49.265 --> 00:43:50.345
I didn't touch this dish.

00:43:52.305 --> 00:43:54.825
Your Ladyship.
Since Lady Wang hasn't come back,

00:43:54.905 --> 00:43:55.745
Madam Wang's downstairs looking for her.

00:43:57.745 --> 00:43:58.585
What a hassle.

00:44:01.145 --> 00:44:03.025
She's been inside for so long.
Why hasn't she come out yet?

00:44:03.105 --> 00:44:04.505
What should we do now?

00:44:04.585 --> 00:44:06.505
Let's go inside and check!

00:44:06.585 --> 00:44:07.985
- Let her out!
- Let her out!

00:44:08.065 --> 00:44:08.905
My dear!

00:44:08.985 --> 00:44:10.585
- Let us in!
- Open it!

00:44:11.225 --> 00:44:12.505
We can't all be stuck here.

00:44:12.585 --> 00:44:14.265
You go investigate the poisoner.

00:44:14.345 --> 00:44:15.345
Go through the back door. Hurry!

00:44:15.425 --> 00:44:16.545
Understood!

00:44:19.465 --> 00:44:20.225
You're leaving too?

00:44:20.305 --> 00:44:22.305
What, stay and get caught up
in their mess?

00:44:22.385 --> 00:44:24.425
The three noble ladies died here.
We can't ignore it.

00:44:25.025 --> 00:44:26.185
Do you want to stay here and deal with it?

00:44:26.865 --> 00:44:28.105
Rather than lingering here uselessly,

00:44:28.185 --> 00:44:29.625
we should hurry and catch the killer.

00:44:29.705 --> 00:44:31.185
My dear!

00:44:32.865 --> 00:44:34.265
- Move.
- My dear!

00:44:34.345 --> 00:44:35.185
It's too late.

00:44:36.585 --> 00:44:38.265
Do you remember what I said earlier?

00:44:38.345 --> 00:44:40.505
- What?
- Prick Shaoshang and Zhongchong

00:44:40.585 --> 00:44:42.265
on the right hand
and squeeze out the toxic blood.

00:44:42.345 --> 00:44:43.985
If the blood turns from dark to bright,

00:44:44.065 --> 00:44:46.025
I'll be saved. Otherwise…

00:44:49.345 --> 00:44:50.985
- Your Ladyship!
- Your Ladyship!

00:44:55.785 --> 00:44:56.905
It's up to you now.

00:44:58.665 --> 00:45:00.865
My dear? My dear?

00:45:02.865 --> 00:45:04.105
My dear?

00:45:07.465 --> 00:45:08.385
My dear!

00:45:09.625 --> 00:45:10.665
My dear!

00:45:10.745 --> 00:45:14.225
My dear daughter has been here

00:45:14.305 --> 00:45:16.705
for just two hours.

00:45:16.785 --> 00:45:19.385
How come she ended up like this?

00:45:21.105 --> 00:45:24.545
Your Ladyship, can you tell me

00:45:24.625 --> 00:45:26.985
what exactly happened?

00:45:27.065 --> 00:45:29.025
Your daughter was poisoned.

00:45:29.105 --> 00:45:30.705
I'm investigating who poisoned her.

00:45:30.785 --> 00:45:32.145
Li Peiyi,

00:45:32.865 --> 00:45:34.385
I still had some respect for you

00:45:34.465 --> 00:45:36.865
as the county princess.

00:45:36.945 --> 00:45:39.105
My daughter shouldn't have come here.

00:45:39.705 --> 00:45:42.705
She came to assist you
with your questioning,

00:45:42.785 --> 00:45:45.305
but she lost her life in your hands.

00:45:45.385 --> 00:45:47.185
If it weren't for you bringing her here,

00:45:47.865 --> 00:45:50.025
she wouldn't have died!

00:45:50.105 --> 00:45:51.545
How could you…

00:45:51.625 --> 00:45:55.025
How could you show
such an indifferent attitude?

00:45:55.105 --> 00:45:58.185
Madam, Her Ladyship is just
earnest in investigating.

00:45:58.265 --> 00:45:59.785
Why don't you take Lady Wang

00:45:59.865 --> 00:46:01.225
back to your house
and let her rest in peace now?

00:46:01.305 --> 00:46:03.185
Then Her Ladyship
can continue the investigation,

00:46:03.265 --> 00:46:04.265
consoling Lady Wang.

00:46:04.345 --> 00:46:06.665
Continue the investigation?

00:46:07.705 --> 00:46:10.985
Can it bring my daughter back?

00:46:11.065 --> 00:46:13.185
Today, you must give an explanation

00:46:13.265 --> 00:46:16.345
to the Minister's mansion and all of us!

00:46:18.665 --> 00:46:19.985
Madam, what explanation do you want?

00:46:21.185 --> 00:46:22.785
Bind her

00:46:22.865 --> 00:46:25.705
and take her to the Emperor
to have him judge.

00:46:25.785 --> 00:46:26.625
Who dares?

00:46:29.425 --> 00:46:31.145
- Your Ladyship!
- Your Ladyship!

00:46:31.225 --> 00:46:32.505
Your Ladyship!
