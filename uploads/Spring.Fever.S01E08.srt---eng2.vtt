WEBVTT

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.171
Sun Han-gyul?

00:01:06.255 --> 00:01:07.089
EPISODE 8

00:01:13.053 --> 00:01:15.389
Who… are you?

00:01:15.472 --> 00:01:16.640
Who am I?

00:01:18.475 --> 00:01:20.686
Well… I…

00:01:25.608 --> 00:01:27.651
Well, I…

00:01:28.527 --> 00:01:29.528
I'm just…

00:01:33.824 --> 00:01:36.285
Don't tell your uncle, okay?

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.205
What? I can't…

00:01:48.797 --> 00:01:52.718
Didn't she say watching me work out
was more fun than watching drama shows?

00:01:53.427 --> 00:01:54.803
Gosh, this foolish woman.

00:01:54.887 --> 00:01:57.681
What should I do
to make her come to her senses?

00:01:57.765 --> 00:01:59.099
This is crazy.

00:02:01.727 --> 00:02:03.103
What the hell?

00:02:03.187 --> 00:02:04.730
Everywhere I go, people are…

00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:08.317
What?

00:02:11.362 --> 00:02:12.237
Wait...

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.493
My goodness!

00:02:20.496 --> 00:02:23.791
Geez, what's all this?

00:02:25.668 --> 00:02:26.752
Darn sand.

00:02:32.466 --> 00:02:36.679
So, Ms. Bom and Mr. Sun, you two are…

00:02:36.762 --> 00:02:37.972
Right?

00:02:38.055 --> 00:02:40.683
Generous and merciful Mr. Jeong,

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.853
if you could turn a blind eye
to what you just saw,

00:02:44.937 --> 00:02:47.231
we'll be indebted to you until we die…

00:02:47.314 --> 00:02:49.149
No, even after we die.

00:02:49.233 --> 00:02:50.401
No.

00:02:50.901 --> 00:02:51.944
Stay out of it.

00:02:52.778 --> 00:02:53.988
Let me handle it.

00:02:58.325 --> 00:03:00.786
What? What are you going to do?

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:02.287
What are you doing?

00:03:12.006 --> 00:03:13.215
You scared me there.

00:03:16.468 --> 00:03:19.847
I wish you a long life
and peace for your family.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.473
Always.

00:03:24.351 --> 00:03:27.396
We both practice martial arts.
If you turn a blind eye,

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:29.690
whatever you want, Mr. Jeong,

00:03:29.773 --> 00:03:32.526
I'll do it for you. Please?

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.279
-Whatever?
-Yes, whatever you want.

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:44.788
Well, since you're asking so desperately,

00:03:44.872 --> 00:03:47.958
it'd be terrible of me
not to do you a favor.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.879
-First, Ms. Bom.
-Yes, Mr. Jeong.

00:03:56.008 --> 00:03:58.594
You're close with the lawyer,
Se-jin's brother, aren't you?

00:04:00.137 --> 00:04:02.431
I want you to get information
on his paralegal.

00:04:02.514 --> 00:04:04.391
The paralegal?

00:04:05.392 --> 00:04:07.519
-Is that really all you want?
-Yes.

00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:10.689
And, you.

00:04:11.356 --> 00:04:12.191
Yes, sir.

00:04:13.442 --> 00:04:14.359
Gosh, this is heavy.

00:04:14.443 --> 00:04:16.278
Oh, give it to me.

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:19.698
Come here.

00:04:22.326 --> 00:04:23.911
-Come with me.
-Okay.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.708
You've got strong trap muscles.

00:04:52.815 --> 00:04:54.983
Don't tell your uncle, okay?

00:05:02.282 --> 00:05:04.743
-Uncle, I…
-But still,

00:05:04.827 --> 00:05:07.621
how could he ask me to do that?
This is crazy.

00:05:08.664 --> 00:05:10.499
Geez.

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:21.760
Hello.

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:36.984
Ms. Bom.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.736
Did you see me on the weekend?

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.364
See you? When? What do you mean?

00:05:44.116 --> 00:05:46.034
Why do I feel like I saw you?

00:05:46.702 --> 00:05:51.582
I think I saw you with someone
at an amusement park.

00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.001
Goodness!

00:05:54.626 --> 00:05:55.836
It was me.

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:57.087
What do you mean?

00:05:57.171 --> 00:06:01.175
Some middle-aged woman ran off
to have fun, leaving her purse behind.

00:06:03.135 --> 00:06:06.346
Then I ran into Ms. Bom.
So we went around together.

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:08.223
Is that a problem?

00:06:09.933 --> 00:06:14.146
Then are you saying Ms. Bom went
to the amusement park by herself?

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:16.565
People go out to eat
or drink alone these days,

00:06:16.648 --> 00:06:18.150
so why not go to an amusement park?

00:06:18.734 --> 00:06:19.943
I couldn't agree more.

00:06:20.777 --> 00:06:23.739
Look, stop suspecting her
for no good reason

00:06:23.822 --> 00:06:25.282
and just check your purse.

00:06:30.287 --> 00:06:31.288
Ms. Bom.

00:06:37.502 --> 00:06:40.088
These are the questions.
Get back to me as soon as possible.

00:06:43.884 --> 00:06:46.845
By the way,
what did you ask Mr. Sun to do?

00:06:47.596 --> 00:06:51.642
You didn't ask him
to kill someone for you, did you?

00:06:57.731 --> 00:07:00.692
SPORTS CENTER

00:07:01.652 --> 00:07:04.071
I shouldn't have signed up for six months.

00:07:05.364 --> 00:07:07.783
I'm not sure if they'll give me a refund.

00:07:18.794 --> 00:07:19.628
Mr. Jeong?

00:08:03.171 --> 00:08:04.256
Han-gyul's uncle...

00:08:06.174 --> 00:08:07.592
got knocked down?

00:08:09.094 --> 00:08:11.513
Have you ever lost in your life?

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:18.687
That's like asking
if I've ever died before.

00:08:19.604 --> 00:08:21.940
That's never happened
and will never happen…

00:08:22.024 --> 00:08:23.233
On Monday,

00:08:24.693 --> 00:08:29.448
the mighty Sun Jae-gyu
will lose to me, Jeong Jin-hyeok.

00:08:30.866 --> 00:08:33.577
My eyes must be getting old.
I must be seeing things.

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:36.246
The man on the ground
truly isn't Mr. Jeong,

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.290
but Han-gyul's uncle?

00:08:39.249 --> 00:08:40.876
Oh, you're here, Ms. Seo.

00:08:41.668 --> 00:08:44.296
All my hard work paid off.

00:08:44.379 --> 00:08:46.882
Anyway, why is he still
lying on the ground?

00:08:47.466 --> 00:08:49.384
Maybe he's hurt somewhere?

00:08:54.056 --> 00:08:56.808
Mr. Sun, it's done. You can get up now.

00:08:58.518 --> 00:09:00.937
I'll stay like this for a while.
You can go.

00:09:06.443 --> 00:09:09.488
You're no match for me. I ought to…

00:09:14.493 --> 00:09:17.079
Gosh, I'm so impressed.

00:09:17.162 --> 00:09:19.206
You've improved so much.

00:09:19.289 --> 00:09:21.875
Seeing that you're back
after a long break,

00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.378
I guess you'll start training again.

00:09:25.379 --> 00:09:28.006
Well, that's not it.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:31.343
I'm so busy these days,
so I came to get a refund…

00:09:35.847 --> 00:09:37.349
Go and get changed.

00:09:39.184 --> 00:09:43.563
Today, I'll be nice and teach you
my secret skills to beat Sun Jae-gyu.

00:09:44.481 --> 00:09:48.026
You mean I can beat him like that too?

00:09:50.779 --> 00:09:51.822
See that?

00:09:52.406 --> 00:09:55.534
He still can't even get up. Can't you see?

00:09:56.576 --> 00:09:57.994
Go get changed quickly.

00:09:58.995 --> 00:10:00.122
Okay, I will.

00:10:00.205 --> 00:10:02.749
Goodness, that's so impressive.

00:10:11.216 --> 00:10:14.136
I wonder what he's doing right now.

00:10:25.647 --> 00:10:26.481
Here.

00:10:28.358 --> 00:10:30.652
If one day, out of the blue,

00:10:30.735 --> 00:10:33.572
you ever find yourself really missing me,
open it then.

00:10:35.407 --> 00:10:37.868
I think I miss him a little.

00:10:39.578 --> 00:10:42.164
How much do I have to miss him
to open this?

00:10:55.927 --> 00:10:58.638
No. It hasn't been that long.

00:10:59.222 --> 00:11:00.182
This isn't right.

00:11:25.207 --> 00:11:27.167
What could be in the box?

00:11:30.045 --> 00:11:30.921
Perfume?

00:11:31.796 --> 00:11:32.923
A handwritten letter?

00:11:34.549 --> 00:11:37.552
Or… maybe a ring?

00:11:51.566 --> 00:11:53.068
-I'm sorry!
-Goodness!

00:11:54.444 --> 00:11:57.364
Bom-sik, are you okay? Are you okay?

00:12:00.158 --> 00:12:01.159
I'm sorry.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:09.376
It's that woman.

00:12:16.883 --> 00:12:18.009
It's that woman.

00:12:29.479 --> 00:12:30.313
My purse.

00:12:31.106 --> 00:12:32.190
Oh, right.

00:12:37.362 --> 00:12:38.738
It must be a Holly bag.

00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:41.783
You know it?

00:12:42.867 --> 00:12:45.662
Well, I only carry big ones
from that brand,

00:12:46.329 --> 00:12:48.373
so I didn't know
they made such small ones.

00:12:49.082 --> 00:12:51.668
But what you're carrying right now…

00:12:53.753 --> 00:12:55.630
I mean, I have them at home. Big ones.

00:12:55.714 --> 00:12:58.633
Right, at home. I see.

00:12:59.926 --> 00:13:02.470
I really have them at home.

00:13:02.554 --> 00:13:04.347
I bought them at the department store.

00:13:04.431 --> 00:13:07.559
-No discount.
-Anyway, what is that smell?

00:13:08.518 --> 00:13:09.811
Oh, my God!

00:13:09.894 --> 00:13:11.855
Goodness. Why are you barking at me?

00:13:11.938 --> 00:13:13.982
Bom-sik, you shouldn't bark.

00:13:15.317 --> 00:13:16.318
Bark at her!

00:13:16.943 --> 00:13:17.944
Good.

00:13:18.028 --> 00:13:19.571
No, stop barking.

00:13:21.865 --> 00:13:24.659
Oh, no. He doesn't usually bark
at just anyone.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.121
Maybe he knows you're not welcome here.

00:13:31.416 --> 00:13:33.293
What did you just say?

00:13:33.376 --> 00:13:35.086
If you're offended, I'm glad…

00:13:38.298 --> 00:13:39.424
I'm sorry.

00:13:40.383 --> 00:13:44.387
But when it comes to insurance,
you can recommend it to those who need it,

00:13:44.471 --> 00:13:47.182
but it's not right
to push it on people repeatedly...

00:13:47.265 --> 00:13:50.727
Is that what Jae-gyu said?
Did he say I came to sell insurance?

00:13:51.311 --> 00:13:52.395
"Jae-gyu"?

00:13:52.896 --> 00:13:54.314
That's impressive.

00:13:54.814 --> 00:13:56.775
He can lie to women now.

00:13:59.486 --> 00:14:03.615
Then you're not here because of insurance?

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:14.084
As for the relationship
between him and me,

00:14:14.834 --> 00:14:17.295
you should hear about it
from Jae-gyu himself.

00:14:19.214 --> 00:14:20.048
Well, then.

00:14:20.131 --> 00:14:22.634
What… Wait.

00:14:29.182 --> 00:14:30.016
What then?

00:14:31.393 --> 00:14:34.813
She's not an insurance agent?

00:15:06.219 --> 00:15:07.512
Hey…

00:15:21.693 --> 00:15:22.986
"A gift for a crush"?

00:15:23.069 --> 00:15:24.571
Is there someone you're into?

00:15:24.654 --> 00:15:26.614
-No.
-Where are you going?

00:15:26.698 --> 00:15:29.492
-Come here.
-Oh, my goodness.

00:15:30.994 --> 00:15:31.828
Han-gyul.

00:15:31.911 --> 00:15:33.496
When you confess your feelings,

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.540
-a gift is not what matters.
-That's right.

00:15:35.623 --> 00:15:36.875
When I was in middle school,

00:15:37.459 --> 00:15:41.087
I stole my mom's credit card
and bought a Korean beef bouquet.

00:15:41.171 --> 00:15:43.923
Then I cleared off the table
during lunch and told her,

00:15:44.632 --> 00:15:46.843
"We're going out if you take this."

00:15:46.926 --> 00:15:50.847
Everyone in the cafeteria went wild,
like they were at a concert.

00:15:51.431 --> 00:15:53.933
So how did it go? Did it work?

00:15:54.601 --> 00:15:55.435
She transferred.

00:15:56.603 --> 00:16:00.023
She was so embarrassed
that she cried her eyes out

00:16:00.106 --> 00:16:01.983
for four whole days.

00:16:02.066 --> 00:16:05.361
After that, she was never seen
in Shinsu again.

00:16:05.445 --> 00:16:07.614
-You little--
-It's true anyway.

00:16:09.908 --> 00:16:10.742
Quiet.

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:15.205
Quiet.

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:18.875
Finals begin tomorrow.

00:16:19.375 --> 00:16:21.419
You should compete with exam results.

00:16:21.503 --> 00:16:22.712
Sir.

00:16:22.796 --> 00:16:26.216
It's Dae-han's turn
to be the bottom in the finals this time.

00:16:28.468 --> 00:16:31.930
What? If we count the mock exam,
it's your turn now.

00:16:33.097 --> 00:16:34.098
Quiet.

00:16:36.351 --> 00:16:39.938
Everyone is only curious
about who comes last in this school.

00:16:42.649 --> 00:16:46.236
But then again, the top student
has never changed.

00:16:46.319 --> 00:16:49.405
Come on, sir. You only dote on Han-gyul.

00:16:49.489 --> 00:16:50.406
Quiet.

00:16:57.205 --> 00:16:58.248
I got it.

00:16:59.499 --> 00:17:00.500
Got what?

00:17:01.709 --> 00:17:02.585
The gift.

00:17:03.795 --> 00:17:07.173
The gift that will make her happy.

00:17:11.845 --> 00:17:13.137
I think I finally got it.

00:17:36.786 --> 00:17:40.874
INHERITANCE PROPERTY DIVISION AGREEMENT

00:17:40.957 --> 00:17:43.585
After I warned her so much
not to come here…

00:17:46.546 --> 00:17:47.380
What was that?

00:17:48.339 --> 00:17:49.549
That sounds like Bom-sik.

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:01.477
Bom… No. Ms. Bom.

00:18:03.479 --> 00:18:07.025
Today's not the day I see Bom-sik.
Why are you here?

00:18:13.698 --> 00:18:15.700
You should keep your promise.

00:18:16.284 --> 00:18:20.163
If you already miss me so much,
how are you going to wait for two years?

00:18:20.246 --> 00:18:21.581
My goodness.

00:18:22.916 --> 00:18:24.792
She's not an insurance agent.

00:18:26.544 --> 00:18:29.088
I just ran into her.

00:18:29.172 --> 00:18:30.048
Tell me the truth.

00:18:31.925 --> 00:18:36.346
If you lie to me again,
forget the two years. We're through.

00:18:42.769 --> 00:18:44.270
CO-INHERITOR: SUN HEE-YEON

00:18:44.354 --> 00:18:45.396
Sun Hee-yeon!

00:18:47.398 --> 00:18:49.067
Stop it, Dad!

00:18:49.901 --> 00:18:51.945
Are you out of your mind?

00:18:52.028 --> 00:18:54.447
We don't even know who the father is.

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:56.783
How dare you bring the kid home?

00:18:56.866 --> 00:18:59.953
You're right!
I'm crazy for coming here again.

00:19:00.036 --> 00:19:03.581
I knew you'd beat me like this.
Still, he's your grandchild,

00:19:03.665 --> 00:19:05.708
so I thought you should see him.

00:19:05.792 --> 00:19:10.296
You left home because you hate me,
and now you say he's my grandchild?

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:14.258
I'm going to kill you today, you brat.

00:19:15.468 --> 00:19:16.302
Hee-yeon.

00:19:20.056 --> 00:19:21.474
-Jae-gyu!
-Go!

00:19:22.016 --> 00:19:23.518
Take the kid and go!

00:19:47.125 --> 00:19:49.627
Jae-gyu. Are you okay?

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.505
Are you out of your mind?

00:19:53.089 --> 00:19:55.258
How could you bring the kid here?

00:19:56.092 --> 00:19:58.219
How can I be in my right mind?

00:19:59.095 --> 00:20:02.682
Every time he comes back from fishing,
he drinks and smashes everything.

00:20:04.517 --> 00:20:07.979
Jae-gyu, do you still believe
Mom died in a car accident?

00:20:10.815 --> 00:20:11.816
I don't.

00:20:11.899 --> 00:20:14.402
I believe she was trying
to get away from him--

00:20:14.485 --> 00:20:15.695
That's enough!

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:22.618
You left after he kept beating you.
You should've known better.

00:20:23.703 --> 00:20:25.496
How will you raise the kid by yourself?

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:26.998
Do you have money to feed him?

00:20:27.582 --> 00:20:28.624
Speaking of which,

00:20:29.792 --> 00:20:33.796
if I'm going to raise him,
I should go to Seoul and earn money.

00:20:43.765 --> 00:20:44.599
Sun Han-gyul.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.394
That's his name.

00:20:50.229 --> 00:20:51.397
You saw it too, right?

00:20:52.315 --> 00:20:55.068
He's a horrible man,
but he won't touch the baby.

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.154
While you take care of Han-gyul,

00:20:58.738 --> 00:21:01.491
I'll go earn enough money
for you, me, and Han-gyul

00:21:01.574 --> 00:21:03.701
to live comfortably, no matter what.

00:21:05.828 --> 00:21:09.999
After that, the three of us
will live far away from him.

00:21:11.876 --> 00:21:15.338
Somewhere he'll never find us again.

00:21:19.634 --> 00:21:20.802
I'll come back for you.

00:21:21.886 --> 00:21:23.179
I'll come for you two.

00:21:25.139 --> 00:21:29.894
Since she disappeared like that,
I haven't heard from her once.

00:21:32.313 --> 00:21:34.482
I'm sorry I lied to you,

00:21:35.608 --> 00:21:39.862
but I haven't even told Han-gyul yet,
so I couldn't tell you.

00:21:43.199 --> 00:21:44.075
Does that mean

00:21:45.576 --> 00:21:49.372
Han-gyul doesn't know
that his mother is alive?

00:21:51.249 --> 00:21:55.086
That woman... is dead to me.

00:21:58.047 --> 00:22:01.175
Han-gyul thinks
his parents died in a fire,

00:22:02.218 --> 00:22:05.138
so don't say anything to him about it.

00:22:05.888 --> 00:22:07.473
I understand how you feel.

00:22:08.641 --> 00:22:11.894
But I still think you should tell him
his mom is alive--

00:22:11.978 --> 00:22:14.105
She doesn't deserve to be his mom.

00:22:18.651 --> 00:22:21.320
She may not,
but a child still misses their mom.

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:24.615
They hate their mom but still miss her.

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:28.494
Do you know
how it feels like to live like that?

00:22:31.581 --> 00:22:33.166
If I were Han-gyul,

00:22:34.458 --> 00:22:38.880
I'd want to know where I came from
and who my parents are.

00:22:40.047 --> 00:22:42.258
I'd want to know that all my life.

00:22:45.386 --> 00:22:49.557
He has the right
to know who his parents are.

00:22:51.517 --> 00:22:52.351
Bom-sik.

00:22:54.896 --> 00:22:55.813
Hey.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:57.315
Hey.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:58.941
You must be tired.

00:23:00.067 --> 00:23:01.944
Is it already our day with Bom-sik?

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:04.030
Yes.

00:23:09.035 --> 00:23:11.037
-Right, here.
-Okay.

00:23:14.165 --> 00:23:17.293
Then take good care of Bom-sik
until the day I take him back.

00:23:17.877 --> 00:23:19.921
And what I told you as Han-gyul's teacher…

00:23:21.881 --> 00:23:23.966
I hope you think about it.

00:23:24.967 --> 00:23:25.801
Bye, then.

00:23:35.061 --> 00:23:36.437
Let's go. Come here.

00:23:37.563 --> 00:23:38.648
-Let's go in.
-Okay.

00:23:45.279 --> 00:23:46.572
Bom-sik, come here.

00:23:47.198 --> 00:23:52.161
A child who went missing 31 years ago
came back to their family recently.

00:23:52.745 --> 00:23:54.997
In 1995, they went missing

00:23:55.081 --> 00:23:58.292
during an outing in Seoul,
and their fate remained unclear for years.

00:23:58.834 --> 00:24:02.588
However, advances in DNA analysis
have now confirmed their identity.

00:24:02.672 --> 00:24:04.590
Han-gyul, is everything okay?

00:24:05.758 --> 00:24:06.592
Yes.

00:24:07.134 --> 00:24:09.220
If you need anything, tell me.

00:24:09.929 --> 00:24:10.972
You know,

00:24:11.055 --> 00:24:14.433
if you wanted, I'd be willing to give you
my liver or gallbladder.

00:24:15.101 --> 00:24:16.727
Even a kidney.

00:24:19.021 --> 00:24:20.481
You draw the line at a kidney?

00:24:21.649 --> 00:24:25.236
For me, if you needed it,
I'd even be willing to give you my heart.

00:24:26.445 --> 00:24:29.240
You're my mom and my dad,
the only family I got.

00:24:29.824 --> 00:24:33.661
So what if I can't breathe?
What if my blood can't circulate?

00:24:46.048 --> 00:24:47.591
Why'd you say that all of a sudden?

00:24:49.302 --> 00:24:50.594
Is something wrong?

00:24:51.262 --> 00:24:52.471
Of course not.

00:24:52.555 --> 00:24:54.724
You have your finals tomorrow.
Go to bed early.

00:25:01.605 --> 00:25:03.441
Typhoon Wangsse, which hit Okinawa,

00:25:03.524 --> 00:25:06.277
is moving north-northwest at a rapid pace.

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:09.613
From tomorrow night,
the eastern and southeastern coasts

00:25:09.697 --> 00:25:13.909
are expected to receive up to 400 mm
of heavy rain, along with strong winds.

00:25:13.993 --> 00:25:17.163
Residents in these areas are urged
to take extra precautions.

00:25:22.918 --> 00:25:24.378
MATH

00:25:44.523 --> 00:25:48.736
That woman... is dead to me.

00:25:55.993 --> 00:25:58.120
Han-gyul, are you finished already?

00:26:01.582 --> 00:26:03.042
It's only been ten minutes.

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:05.628
Yes.

00:26:06.337 --> 00:26:07.880
That's Sun Han-gyul for you.

00:26:07.963 --> 00:26:09.882
No wonder he's the top student.

00:26:13.427 --> 00:26:14.261
Quiet.

00:26:25.356 --> 00:26:28.359
Today I took the math, ethics
and bioscience exams.

00:26:28.442 --> 00:26:31.153
English, literature
and world history are tomorrow.

00:26:32.071 --> 00:26:36.659
And Dong-pyo wants to discuss
his grandma's 70th birthday with you.

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:44.834
INHERITANCE PROPERTY DIVISION AGREEMENT

00:26:44.917 --> 00:26:47.461
CO-INHERITOR: SUN HEE-YEON

00:26:49.422 --> 00:26:50.881
SUN JAE-GYU

00:26:59.265 --> 00:27:01.350
Think about it rationally, Jae-gyu.

00:27:03.436 --> 00:27:04.645
Dad…

00:27:06.355 --> 00:27:08.732
What did Dad ever do for us?

00:27:09.733 --> 00:27:13.112
The only thing he left us
is that piece of land that won't sell.

00:27:14.321 --> 00:27:16.449
If a resort is built there…

00:27:19.994 --> 00:27:22.288
I hoped you'd say
you came to see Han-gyul.

00:27:24.498 --> 00:27:26.125
I carried the crying kid on my back,

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.212
and waited for you to come back every day.

00:27:32.089 --> 00:27:33.466
"Han-gyul, your mom…

00:27:35.342 --> 00:27:37.386
will come back for us no matter what."

00:27:39.263 --> 00:27:40.556
"Let's wait one more day."

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:42.892
"Let's wait two more days."

00:27:47.938 --> 00:27:50.024
I'll vanish like you want.

00:27:53.986 --> 00:27:55.613
I won't come to see you…

00:27:57.698 --> 00:28:01.535
or run into Han-gyul ever again.

00:28:03.579 --> 00:28:04.747
If you sign here--

00:28:14.423 --> 00:28:15.424
Hey, Dong-pyo.

00:28:16.425 --> 00:28:17.384
What?

00:28:20.971 --> 00:28:25.434
All right. I'll come pick you up now,
so don't worry. Look after your grandma.

00:28:26.477 --> 00:28:27.311
Okay.

00:28:28.354 --> 00:28:30.189
What is it? What's wrong?

00:28:30.272 --> 00:28:32.316
The power went out in the neighborhood.

00:28:34.902 --> 00:28:36.695
EMERGENCY ALERT

00:28:36.779 --> 00:28:37.655
Right.

00:28:37.738 --> 00:28:40.241
I guess our house is okay
thanks to the solar panels.

00:28:40.324 --> 00:28:43.661
Dong-pyo's grandma needs electricity,
so I'll go get her.

00:28:43.744 --> 00:28:47.623
You tell other neighbors to come here
if they need electricity too. Okay?

00:28:47.706 --> 00:28:49.083
Wait. Then…

00:28:50.167 --> 00:28:52.002
Can Se-jin and her brother come too?

00:28:52.086 --> 00:28:53.837
Why would you bring I-jun here?

00:28:53.921 --> 00:28:57.758
Se-jin needs to study for tomorrow too.
She must be so frustrated right now.

00:28:58.676 --> 00:29:01.136
But it's pouring.
I can't tell her to come alone.

00:29:02.805 --> 00:29:04.139
As you wish. I'll be back.

00:29:14.358 --> 00:29:15.442
Did you pee?

00:29:18.195 --> 00:29:19.905
-Give it back now!
-I won't.

00:29:21.282 --> 00:29:24.910
Ms. Seo. Let me tell you
about the way of a true educator.

00:29:24.994 --> 00:29:28.372
It was back when I was 26 years old.

00:29:28.455 --> 00:29:31.250
When I started out as a teacher...

00:29:31.333 --> 00:29:33.002
They all took the offer and came.

00:29:34.795 --> 00:29:36.547
Stop running!

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:37.715
Hey!

00:29:41.343 --> 00:29:43.804
Bottom of the ninth. Two outs,

00:29:43.887 --> 00:29:46.265
two strikes, two balls.
It's a crucial moment.

00:29:46.348 --> 00:29:49.268
The tension is building.
Here comes the pitch!

00:29:49.351 --> 00:29:50.811
The batter makes contact!

00:29:50.894 --> 00:29:52.521
-It's big.
-It's going over.

00:29:52.605 --> 00:29:54.690
-It's going over.
-It's going over!

00:29:54.773 --> 00:29:56.150
-It's going.
-Home run!

00:29:56.233 --> 00:29:59.737
A home run in the bottom
of the ninth. Unbelievable!

00:30:01.322 --> 00:30:04.158
Hey! Who ran off
after clogging the toilet?

00:30:04.241 --> 00:30:05.784
Min-guk took a big dump.

00:30:05.868 --> 00:30:07.745
I needed to make space in my stomach.

00:30:07.828 --> 00:30:09.788
What are you, a pooping machine?

00:30:11.206 --> 00:30:12.916
I can't believe this.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.085
It was their birthday party and…

00:30:21.759 --> 00:30:24.595
Out! It's out!
They're going into extra innings.

00:30:24.678 --> 00:30:26.096
Uncle!

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:27.723
My goodness.

00:30:27.806 --> 00:30:31.143
Why on earth is everyone here?

00:30:34.521 --> 00:30:35.814
-Here.
-Okay.

00:30:38.192 --> 00:30:39.818
Hey! Keep it down, brats!

00:30:39.902 --> 00:30:41.403
Stop that and stay quiet.

00:30:43.238 --> 00:30:45.240
Everyone, quiet!

00:30:51.413 --> 00:30:53.874
Order is most crucial
when you're in a group.

00:30:54.541 --> 00:30:56.627
It seems like you all need
to stay the night here,

00:30:56.710 --> 00:31:01.173
so from now on,
you will have to do as I say.

00:31:01.256 --> 00:31:02.174
Do you understand?

00:31:02.257 --> 00:31:03.759
-Yes, Master!
-Yes!

00:31:03.842 --> 00:31:06.178
First, Ms. Seo and Mr. Jeong.

00:31:06.261 --> 00:31:08.889
Please find some ingredients
in the fridge and cook.

00:31:10.766 --> 00:31:13.060
Well, all right.

00:31:13.811 --> 00:31:14.853
Mr. Wi.

00:31:15.437 --> 00:31:18.232
If there are more coming,
pick them up with Phillip.

00:31:18.315 --> 00:31:20.109
-Yes, sir.
-Han-gyul.

00:31:20.192 --> 00:31:22.194
You assign the rooms
and prepare their beds.

00:31:23.153 --> 00:31:24.405
-Dong-pyo.
-Yes.

00:31:24.488 --> 00:31:25.531
Clean and organize shoes.

00:31:25.614 --> 00:31:27.533
Uncle, what about us?

00:31:27.616 --> 00:31:29.118
Right. You two…

00:31:30.077 --> 00:31:32.162
Do nothing. That's more helpful.

00:31:34.998 --> 00:31:37.209
If you're done with assigning tasks,

00:31:37.292 --> 00:31:39.670
-we'll get back to the game.
-Mr. Hong.

00:31:40.504 --> 00:31:43.090
You need to take on
the most important task.

00:31:46.093 --> 00:31:49.638
Well, since I'm the head teacher
at school,

00:31:50.222 --> 00:31:51.390
I'll supervise.

00:31:52.516 --> 00:31:53.892
Unclog the toilet, please.

00:31:56.937 --> 00:31:57.771
The toilet?

00:31:57.855 --> 00:31:58.939
It's clogged.

00:31:59.022 --> 00:32:01.900
The toilet usually
has to deal with just two people,

00:32:01.984 --> 00:32:04.737
but now there are ten people.
It must've been hard on it.

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:06.613
Okay? Okay.

00:32:06.697 --> 00:32:10.117
All right. If you don't like the task
I've assigned you,

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.161
you can leave here now.

00:32:12.244 --> 00:32:14.329
For your information,
in this neighborhood,

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:18.542
the only place you can watch TV
during a blackout and a typhoon

00:32:18.625 --> 00:32:19.877
is this house.

00:32:20.544 --> 00:32:22.838
Now, to your positions!

00:32:22.921 --> 00:32:24.256
To positions!

00:32:25.758 --> 00:32:27.009
Let's get moving!

00:32:32.097 --> 00:32:33.098
Uncle.

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.309
I can't reach Ms. Bom.

00:32:35.934 --> 00:32:36.769
Ms. Bom?

00:32:36.852 --> 00:32:38.562
She hasn't been answering my calls.

00:32:40.355 --> 00:32:43.275
Ms. Bom was with Se-jin's brother.

00:32:44.818 --> 00:32:46.278
I talked to her an hour ago.

00:32:53.118 --> 00:32:54.453
Were you with Ms. Bom?

00:32:56.079 --> 00:32:57.623
Did you hear? Well,

00:32:58.165 --> 00:33:00.667
she wanted to thank me
for the special lecture,

00:33:00.751 --> 00:33:02.127
so she came to my office.

00:33:02.211 --> 00:33:04.296
Forget that. Where is she right now?

00:33:06.089 --> 00:33:10.093
While we were talking, she got a call
from Mr. Jeong and left in a hurry.

00:33:10.177 --> 00:33:11.053
Why do you ask?

00:33:12.721 --> 00:33:13.597
She's not here?

00:33:14.598 --> 00:33:18.143
I heard that the lower areas got flooded.

00:33:19.728 --> 00:33:22.314
Han-gyul, take good care of them.

00:33:33.367 --> 00:33:34.409
Ms. Bom!

00:33:36.703 --> 00:33:38.080
Ms. Bom!

00:33:53.136 --> 00:33:54.346
Ms. Bom!

00:33:57.224 --> 00:33:58.600
Ms. Bom!

00:34:00.435 --> 00:34:01.645
Ms. Bom!

00:34:10.279 --> 00:34:13.198
Goodness. What a brat.

00:34:13.282 --> 00:34:15.534
Following around some singer.

00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:18.412
I don't believe you.

00:34:18.954 --> 00:34:20.789
Were you worried about me, Seong-tae?

00:34:21.707 --> 00:34:22.583
Ms. Bom?

00:34:22.666 --> 00:34:25.127
Han-gyul's uncle went to find her.

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:26.420
Don't worry.

00:34:27.004 --> 00:34:29.548
How's Seoul? Is it raining a lot?

00:34:32.759 --> 00:34:35.012
All right. So, does he have any kids?

00:34:35.095 --> 00:34:36.096
Kids?

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:38.181
He's never been married. What kids?

00:34:38.265 --> 00:34:40.601
No, he's divorced.

00:34:40.684 --> 00:34:44.021
He said he went to family court
to file for divorce in 2017.

00:34:44.104 --> 00:34:45.564
I doubt that.

00:34:45.647 --> 00:34:47.774
Mr. Choi came down here with Mr. Oh

00:34:47.858 --> 00:34:51.737
because all of their colleagues
were married except for him.

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:52.779
What?

00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:56.366
I heard you.

00:34:57.034 --> 00:34:59.536
I'll call you before I go to sleep.

00:35:01.121 --> 00:35:02.706
Bye, Seong-tae.

00:35:05.083 --> 00:35:06.627
He's so sweet.

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:07.544
Goodness.

00:35:07.628 --> 00:35:09.630
-Can we talk for a bit?
-Why?

00:35:10.422 --> 00:35:11.798
Let's talk.

00:35:12.382 --> 00:35:14.134
-What is it?
-Just follow me.

00:35:16.386 --> 00:35:17.721
Come on.

00:35:19.389 --> 00:35:20.307
What's with him?

00:35:26.396 --> 00:35:28.065
What? What is it?

00:35:30.609 --> 00:35:33.236
That Seong-tae guy or whatever,

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.113
how much do you know about him?

00:35:38.075 --> 00:35:41.244
He has his own apartment
in Suro-dong, Seoul.

00:35:41.328 --> 00:35:42.496
And in 2017…

00:35:43.538 --> 00:35:46.416
Why do I have to tell you this?

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:48.418
Did he ask you for money?

00:35:48.502 --> 00:35:50.295
What on earth are you getting at?

00:35:50.379 --> 00:35:51.880
Romance scams.

00:35:52.673 --> 00:35:53.507
What?

00:35:54.466 --> 00:35:58.095
They're con men that act interested
and pretend to love you

00:35:58.178 --> 00:35:59.972
just to get money out of you.

00:36:01.974 --> 00:36:05.227
Are you saying
Seong-tae approached me for money?

00:36:05.769 --> 00:36:09.272
I guess I look quite rich.
Thanks for thinking of me that way.

00:36:14.569 --> 00:36:17.114
Look. Don't be shocked.

00:36:17.614 --> 00:36:19.616
Okay? Listen to me carefully.

00:36:20.492 --> 00:36:21.743
That guy's...

00:36:23.078 --> 00:36:24.454
never been married.

00:36:26.123 --> 00:36:27.791
-Never married?
-Yes.

00:36:27.874 --> 00:36:29.835
Like you?

00:36:32.337 --> 00:36:34.631
He says he's divorced!

00:36:34.715 --> 00:36:38.844
Why on earth would a bachelor
pretend to be a divorcee?

00:36:38.927 --> 00:36:42.014
Enough. Stop talking nonsense
and go eat your dinner.

00:36:42.806 --> 00:36:44.975
If you can't believe it,
go ask him yourself.

00:36:45.058 --> 00:36:47.019
It's what Se-jin's brother said!

00:36:49.187 --> 00:36:51.106
Gosh, it's impossible to talk to her.

00:36:51.815 --> 00:36:52.983
She never listens.

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:15.922
God, how could you do this?

00:37:16.465 --> 00:37:20.510
I mean, on top of heavy rain, a blackout?

00:37:22.387 --> 00:37:24.222
It definitely went this way.

00:37:28.143 --> 00:37:29.311
Where on earth is it?

00:37:35.484 --> 00:37:36.568
Ms. Bom!

00:37:37.861 --> 00:37:39.780
-Ms. Bom!
-What?

00:37:40.906 --> 00:37:42.407
I'm even hearing things now.

00:37:47.079 --> 00:37:49.581
Please be here. Please. Darn it.

00:37:51.249 --> 00:37:52.167
There.

00:37:54.044 --> 00:37:55.504
SHINSU BATHHOUSE

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.715
I found it!

00:38:30.455 --> 00:38:31.623
Darn it.

00:38:32.749 --> 00:38:35.585
I came to watch baseball.
Why am I doing this?

00:38:35.669 --> 00:38:38.171
And Dong-pyo's grandma
took the remote control.

00:38:40.423 --> 00:38:43.260
Anyway, I'm quite impressed
by Han-gyul's uncle.

00:38:43.844 --> 00:38:47.764
The power went out,
and he brought all of us to his house,

00:38:47.848 --> 00:38:49.724
fed us and is letting us sleep here.

00:38:49.808 --> 00:38:51.601
It's not an easy thing to do.

00:38:51.685 --> 00:38:52.811
Quiet.

00:38:54.479 --> 00:38:56.481
Mr. Toilet, is it not done yet?

00:38:56.565 --> 00:38:58.358
I really need to go.

00:38:58.441 --> 00:38:59.943
-Use the other one!
-Okay.

00:39:01.111 --> 00:39:03.572
Sir, the toilet
in the master bedroom just died too.

00:39:03.655 --> 00:39:04.823
Please unclog that one too.

00:39:04.906 --> 00:39:07.826
Stop pooping already! You're killing me!

00:39:07.909 --> 00:39:09.953
Please don't yell. Hold on.

00:39:10.036 --> 00:39:11.037
I ought to…

00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:16.084
Hey, what are the others doing?

00:39:16.168 --> 00:39:19.004
I'm coming at you. I'm coming.

00:39:19.087 --> 00:39:20.255
Bring it on.

00:39:20.338 --> 00:39:22.924
Now, jump! And one, two, three!

00:39:25.177 --> 00:39:26.553
Evil Han-gyul.

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:29.431
He should be studying for tomorrow.

00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:30.974
He's playing games?

00:39:31.474 --> 00:39:33.226
Finishing moves. One, two, three.

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:34.686
-Take this!
-What are you doing?

00:39:38.315 --> 00:39:39.191
I crushed you!

00:39:39.274 --> 00:39:44.070
The top student in Shinsu High
has been beaten by Oh Dong-pyo!

00:39:45.864 --> 00:39:48.116
Pick another game. I'll go do the laundry.

00:39:49.075 --> 00:39:51.119
Which game should I crush you at?

00:40:29.741 --> 00:40:30.825
Oh, my.

00:40:35.247 --> 00:40:37.415
No. I can explain…

00:41:16.746 --> 00:41:20.333
What are you doing here?

00:41:22.627 --> 00:41:23.586
What do you think?

00:41:24.337 --> 00:41:25.213
I was snooping.

00:41:25.797 --> 00:41:27.007
-Snooping?
-Yes.

00:41:27.799 --> 00:41:30.593
I'm more honest than I may look,
so I'll be straight with you.

00:41:30.677 --> 00:41:33.263
I came here to find out something.

00:41:33.346 --> 00:41:35.932
How you solved
all the questions in ten minutes

00:41:36.016 --> 00:41:37.976
and how you always top the exams.

00:41:38.059 --> 00:41:39.811
Why are you looking for that answer here?

00:41:40.395 --> 00:41:41.730
Then where should I?

00:41:44.232 --> 00:41:45.275
Follow me.

00:41:50.739 --> 00:41:52.824
This is the on-off switch.

00:41:52.907 --> 00:41:54.576
Adjust the brightness with this.

00:41:57.037 --> 00:41:59.080
And for online lectures, use this.

00:42:00.999 --> 00:42:03.710
I'll make sure
no one comes in here from now on,

00:42:03.793 --> 00:42:05.337
so study as much as you want.

00:42:06.004 --> 00:42:07.881
I changed the pillow cover and comforter.

00:42:10.967 --> 00:42:12.761
If I sleep here, what about you?

00:42:12.844 --> 00:42:15.764
We have an expensive couch.

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:29.861
I've read this one.

00:42:32.364 --> 00:42:33.615
And this one too.

00:42:36.117 --> 00:42:37.869
These are the notes he lent me.

00:42:40.288 --> 00:42:41.206
Darn it.

00:42:41.289 --> 00:42:43.708
There's nothing special here.

00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:58.014
So this is Han-gyul's room.

00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:32.257
Ms. Bom, can you hear me?

00:43:39.764 --> 00:43:40.723
Mr. Choi?

00:43:41.891 --> 00:43:43.435
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

00:43:45.478 --> 00:43:46.855
What happened?

00:43:47.439 --> 00:43:49.190
The sign was swaying because of the wind.

00:43:49.691 --> 00:43:51.443
I think you got frightened and fainted.

00:43:53.611 --> 00:43:55.196
You left the office long ago.

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.699
What have you been doing all this time?

00:44:00.785 --> 00:44:02.829
I had to do something.

00:44:03.663 --> 00:44:04.873
Thank you.

00:44:05.832 --> 00:44:09.127
Let's talk inside. Can you walk?

00:44:23.016 --> 00:44:23.975
Come in.

00:44:26.227 --> 00:44:28.938
This is the only place
we can use electricity right now.

00:44:31.483 --> 00:44:32.650
ACTRESS JEONG NAN-HEE

00:44:34.402 --> 00:44:38.323
You should go take a shower first
so you don't catch a cold.

00:44:38.406 --> 00:44:42.076
-I'm going to take this call.
-Okay.

00:44:44.412 --> 00:44:45.246
Hello?

00:44:55.173 --> 00:44:56.508
You're home.

00:44:59.135 --> 00:45:03.306
Well, Mr. Choi said
this is the only place with electricity.

00:45:05.808 --> 00:45:08.019
What were you doing outside
in this weather?

00:45:08.603 --> 00:45:12.065
Well, I was looking for something.

00:45:12.732 --> 00:45:14.651
Where's your common sense?

00:45:16.319 --> 00:45:18.363
Who goes out to do that in this rain?

00:45:18.446 --> 00:45:19.364
Look.

00:45:20.156 --> 00:45:23.535
Don't you think
I must've had my reasons to do that?

00:45:23.618 --> 00:45:25.995
You may have, but you're being a nuisance.

00:45:27.872 --> 00:45:31.501
"Are you hurt? Are you okay?" Shouldn't
you ask something like that first?

00:45:31.584 --> 00:45:33.169
Those kinds of questions...

00:45:33.753 --> 00:45:35.922
are for people with common sense

00:45:43.096 --> 00:45:44.806
I came to wash up with lights on,

00:45:45.557 --> 00:45:47.308
but I should just shower at my place.

00:45:48.101 --> 00:45:51.271
Since I only use expensive shower gels
from department stores.

00:46:00.697 --> 00:46:02.407
Common sense? A nuisance?

00:46:02.991 --> 00:46:05.618
When was I a nuisance to him?

00:46:11.833 --> 00:46:13.084
Why did you follow me out?

00:46:14.252 --> 00:46:17.297
Shower gels from supermarkets
or department stores are all the same.

00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:18.840
Why is it so important

00:46:18.923 --> 00:46:21.676
that you're going
to your place with no electricity?

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:25.179
You clearly don't know
what I was implying.

00:46:25.763 --> 00:46:28.182
Do you really think
it's because of shower gel?

00:46:28.933 --> 00:46:32.604
I'm soaking wet, and you went on
about common sense out of the blue.

00:46:33.479 --> 00:46:36.608
Since you've only lived
in an apartment in Seoul,

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:42.196
you might find rain romantic,
watching it from high up in your room.

00:46:42.697 --> 00:46:43.698
But it's different here.

00:46:45.158 --> 00:46:46.701
Here, when a typhoon comes,

00:46:47.994 --> 00:46:52.457
it's common sense
to abandon your house or boat to survive.

00:46:53.416 --> 00:46:57.086
What's more important than your life
that you went out in a typhoon?

00:47:01.883 --> 00:47:02.842
Happy now?

00:47:10.308 --> 00:47:13.519
You know, I care about my life so much.

00:47:14.103 --> 00:47:17.857
Look. I have such a nice body.
How can I not cherish my life?

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:19.192
But that's…

00:47:20.485 --> 00:47:22.862
your first gift for me.

00:47:26.658 --> 00:47:27.742
So,

00:47:29.118 --> 00:47:32.914
you couldn't go home in this weather
because of this stupid thing?

00:47:33.581 --> 00:47:35.458
It could be something expensive.

00:47:35.541 --> 00:47:36.668
Like jewels or gold.

00:47:37.251 --> 00:47:40.505
If it's something like that,
it would've been such a waste.

00:47:41.673 --> 00:47:42.590
And if…

00:47:43.424 --> 00:47:45.176
If it's…

00:47:46.594 --> 00:47:48.012
an engagement ring,

00:47:49.222 --> 00:47:52.975
I would've ended up
turning away your sincere feelings.

00:47:56.145 --> 00:47:57.647
I should've kept it at home.

00:47:59.023 --> 00:48:02.443
Why did I have to carry it
in my bag and lose it?

00:48:02.944 --> 00:48:07.532
Ms. Bom. I could buy it for you
a thousand times over,

00:48:07.615 --> 00:48:11.911
so don't ever put yourself in danger
for something like that.

00:48:12.912 --> 00:48:15.540
What if the sign really hit you?

00:48:17.083 --> 00:48:18.209
How did you know?

00:48:21.087 --> 00:48:21.921
What?

00:48:23.131 --> 00:48:25.717
How did you know
I almost got hit by a sign?

00:48:32.181 --> 00:48:33.266
Ms. Bom!

00:48:34.392 --> 00:48:35.685
Ms. Bom!

00:48:36.269 --> 00:48:37.687
Ms. Bom!

00:49:30.281 --> 00:49:32.658
What about Ms. Bom? Is she okay?

00:49:32.742 --> 00:49:35.036
I think she fainted from shock.

00:49:37.789 --> 00:49:38.623
What about you?

00:49:43.169 --> 00:49:44.045
I'm fine.

00:49:44.128 --> 00:49:45.797
So hurry up and take her home.

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:47.840
Don't worry, and go get it treated now!

00:49:54.972 --> 00:49:58.643
I treated it and got changed quickly
so you wouldn't find out.

00:50:01.771 --> 00:50:06.526
But still,
I think I was too harsh earlier.

00:50:08.778 --> 00:50:10.822
The thought that the sign nearly hit you

00:50:11.322 --> 00:50:14.534
made me mad. I felt a surge of anger.

00:50:16.869 --> 00:50:20.122
Are you crying, Mr. Sun?

00:50:20.206 --> 00:50:21.415
Am I?

00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:23.668
It's not rain?

00:50:23.751 --> 00:50:24.794
No, you're crying.

00:50:26.254 --> 00:50:29.340
Ms. Bom. Let me tell you about me.

00:50:29.924 --> 00:50:33.427
I don't think I've ever cried
except when I was born.

00:50:36.556 --> 00:50:38.015
Look. They're tears.

00:50:38.641 --> 00:50:39.517
What?

00:50:44.272 --> 00:50:45.606
What's wrong with me?

00:50:46.274 --> 00:50:49.485
Now that you know I'm okay, stop crying.

00:50:49.569 --> 00:50:50.403
Stop.

00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:57.285
I can't stop.

00:50:57.869 --> 00:50:58.703
What?

00:51:00.454 --> 00:51:04.750
I've never cried before,
so I don't know how to stop.

00:51:07.879 --> 00:51:10.840
Then try reciting
the multiplication table.

00:51:10.923 --> 00:51:12.383
The multiplication table?

00:51:12.466 --> 00:51:17.054
I read somewhere that you cry
when your right brain is active.

00:51:17.138 --> 00:51:20.516
So if you use your left brain,
it might make the right one inactive.

00:51:21.267 --> 00:51:22.393
The multiplication table?

00:51:24.687 --> 00:51:26.731
One times two is two.
Two times two is four.

00:51:26.814 --> 00:51:28.816
Two times three is six.
Two times four is eight.

00:51:30.776 --> 00:51:31.777
It's not working.

00:51:33.237 --> 00:51:34.947
Then how about this?

00:51:39.994 --> 00:51:41.203
I'm not ticklish.

00:51:42.204 --> 00:51:45.958
Nothing logical or physical works.
What should I do?

00:51:47.043 --> 00:51:51.881
Then how about
something romantic, like this?

00:52:05.144 --> 00:52:08.648
I think it's working.

00:52:11.359 --> 00:52:12.360
That's a relief.

00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:13.694
Let's go, then.

00:52:16.614 --> 00:52:17.531
Well…

00:52:19.533 --> 00:52:23.746
I think
to make it stop completely, you know…

00:53:42.533 --> 00:53:46.954
Since the power's back on,
I should go home…

00:53:47.038 --> 00:53:50.374
Just... stay the night here.

00:53:51.292 --> 00:53:53.502
I can't let you be alone.
I'll be too worried.

00:53:55.212 --> 00:53:57.298
Han-gyul likes gaengsigi porridge,

00:53:57.381 --> 00:54:00.551
so I bought some bean sprouts.
Let's eat together in the morning.

00:54:01.761 --> 00:54:03.888
By the way, Han-gyul still…

00:54:05.973 --> 00:54:07.349
doesn't know, does he?

00:54:13.939 --> 00:54:14.774
Ms. Bom.

00:54:17.443 --> 00:54:18.694
I'm…

00:54:21.697 --> 00:54:22.907
more scared…

00:54:26.368 --> 00:54:28.788
of Han-gyul finding out
his mom abandoned him...

00:54:34.001 --> 00:54:36.670
than him finding out that I lied to him.

00:54:40.966 --> 00:54:42.259
That scares me more.

00:55:21.882 --> 00:55:24.635
Why did you come out?
Do you want some water too?

00:55:25.261 --> 00:55:27.972
No. I felt a bit cold.

00:55:31.016 --> 00:55:32.977
The comforters here are all we got.

00:55:34.687 --> 00:55:37.731
Wait here. I'm sure
there's a heating mat in my uncle's room.

00:56:03.174 --> 00:56:04.800
COURT OF KOREA

00:56:17.313 --> 00:56:20.065
"Inheritance Property Division Agreement"?

00:56:30.826 --> 00:56:31.744
"Sun Hee-yeon"?

00:56:35.039 --> 00:56:38.542
Why is the seal
of a dead person stamped here?

00:56:42.796 --> 00:56:43.923
Sun Han-gyul?

00:56:46.717 --> 00:56:48.552
Who… are you?

00:56:49.345 --> 00:56:50.179
Who am I?

00:56:51.931 --> 00:56:54.141
Well… I…

00:57:00.272 --> 00:57:02.358
Hey. Evil Han-gyul.

00:57:03.609 --> 00:57:07.238
I haven't forgiven her yet.

00:57:08.906 --> 00:57:11.867
But you said he has the right
to know who his parents are.

00:57:14.078 --> 00:57:15.496
What you said...

00:57:17.581 --> 00:57:19.458
has been stuck in my head.

00:57:23.712 --> 00:57:27.049
I'll think more about
what will be better for Han-gyul.

00:57:34.848 --> 00:57:35.766
Uncle.

00:57:38.727 --> 00:57:39.561
Yes.

00:57:57.997 --> 00:57:59.039
"Sun Hee-yeon."

00:58:03.043 --> 00:58:05.671
It's my mom's name,
who you said died in a fire.

00:58:15.973 --> 00:58:16.890
Is she alive?

00:59:09.526 --> 00:59:12.988
Uncle! Han-gyul went to Seoul.

00:59:13.697 --> 00:59:15.074
I'm glad you came, Han-gyul.

00:59:16.533 --> 00:59:19.495
Because your uncle
wouldn't let me see you.

00:59:19.578 --> 00:59:21.497
Can I call you Mom?

00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:23.916
Because I was heartbroken.

00:59:23.999 --> 00:59:27.669
You haven't been there for Han-gyul
until now, so make it up to him.

00:59:27.753 --> 00:59:31.298
Today, let's be confident
and have as much fun as we want.

00:59:31.382 --> 00:59:32.257
Let's do that.

00:59:39.306 --> 00:59:41.308
