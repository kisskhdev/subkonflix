Ms. Hong Yeon Hee.

00:01:07.715 --> 00:01:08.715
Ms. Hong Yeon Hee.

00:01:17.925 --> 00:01:19.125
I've been waiting for you.

00:01:21.425 --> 00:01:22.425
Ra Young.

00:01:50.625 --> 00:01:51.785
Where's Ms. Hong Yeon Hee?

00:01:53.485 --> 00:01:54.955
You came because of the text?

00:01:56.795 --> 00:01:57.795
"Help me."

00:02:00.735 --> 00:02:02.065
I'm the one who sent that.

00:02:06.165 --> 00:02:07.535
What have you done?

00:02:11.875 --> 00:02:14.475
"Okay. I'm sorry."

00:02:14.975 --> 00:02:16.315
"I won't do it again."

00:02:17.015 --> 00:02:19.685
Okay. I'm sorry.

00:02:20.115 --> 00:02:21.355
I won't do it again.

00:02:21.785 --> 00:02:24.655
That's what you said, Ra Young. You said it yourself.

00:02:27.055 --> 00:02:28.125
That night...

00:02:29.025 --> 00:02:30.465
It was a night just like this.

00:02:33.735 --> 00:02:35.795
Now I remember it all so vividly.

00:02:37.165 --> 00:02:38.165
That night.

00:02:40.905 --> 00:02:42.475
The sound of the crickets,

00:02:44.145 --> 00:02:45.345
the sound of the wind.

00:02:47.515 --> 00:02:48.615
And you...

00:02:50.985 --> 00:02:54.185
- Think this nonsense will work? - Let me go!

00:02:57.425 --> 00:03:01.795
Is that why you brazenly dragged my wife into your scheme?

00:03:04.425 --> 00:03:05.765
It's just like back then.

00:03:07.235 --> 00:03:09.195
No matter what happens here,

00:03:10.265 --> 00:03:11.765
there's no one to help you.

00:03:13.805 --> 00:03:14.805
And...

00:03:15.675 --> 00:03:16.935
you...

00:03:18.045 --> 00:03:19.375
won't be able to say a word anyway.

00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:21.245
You were the same way back then.

00:03:21.875 --> 00:03:22.875
Because you were scared?

00:03:23.845 --> 00:03:27.114
You kept quiet to cover for your friends who cracked my head?

00:03:27.115 --> 00:03:28.685
No, that wasn't it, Ra Young.

00:03:29.455 --> 00:03:31.085
Could you really have reported them?

00:03:32.155 --> 00:03:34.025
Did you have the courage to stand up in court?

00:03:35.255 --> 00:03:39.225
Afraid the whole world would find out what happened to you.

00:03:40.325 --> 00:03:43.035
Afraid they would forever see you as nothing but a victim.

00:03:43.735 --> 00:03:45.635
That's what you were afraid of, wasn't it?

00:03:47.005 --> 00:03:48.505
You're still afraid, aren't you?

00:03:52.005 --> 00:03:53.005
That's not true.

00:03:55.075 --> 00:03:56.375
- I'm not... - What?

00:03:57.715 --> 00:03:58.785
Go on. Say it.

00:03:59.415 --> 00:04:01.485
Say it, and I'll let you go.

00:04:02.685 --> 00:04:05.085
What happened to you that night?

00:04:06.825 --> 00:04:08.355
Say it yourself.

00:04:10.995 --> 00:04:11.995
Shut it.

00:04:12.425 --> 00:04:13.425
Why?

00:04:13.765 --> 00:04:15.895
It's not like you're telling the whole world.

00:04:16.265 --> 00:04:17.965
After all, I already know everything.

00:04:18.665 --> 00:04:20.575
That terrified look on your face, just like now,

00:04:21.435 --> 00:04:23.275
your look of utter despair,

00:04:23.635 --> 00:04:26.605
how helpless and pathetic you were.

00:04:27.345 --> 00:04:28.815
I saw it all.

00:04:34.215 --> 00:04:35.255
You can't do it?

00:04:39.825 --> 00:04:43.155
Then why start something you can't finish,

00:04:43.225 --> 00:04:45.665
pulling a stunt like this, Ra Young?

00:04:49.795 --> 00:04:51.935
You'll never escape that night. You know why?

00:04:52.565 --> 00:04:56.435
Because I can crush you like this whenever I want!

00:05:35.015 --> 00:05:36.545
What's the situation with the Magan Hotel?

00:05:36.815 --> 00:05:38.945
Yes, sir. It's been handled.

00:05:39.785 --> 00:05:41.655
It's unlikely she'll regain consciousness.

00:05:46.755 --> 00:05:49.295
Are you out of your mind? Leaving just one text...

00:05:49.355 --> 00:05:50.965
and going in there alone? What were you thinking?

00:05:51.425 --> 00:05:52.725
Nothing happened.

00:05:56.835 --> 00:05:58.735
How are you feeling? Are you okay?

00:06:02.805 --> 00:06:04.505
Yes, I've found Ra Young.

00:06:05.245 --> 00:06:06.445
How's the victim?

00:06:06.875 --> 00:06:08.915
They're saying it was an overdose. She's in critical condition.

00:06:09.275 --> 00:06:11.845
She had cardiac arrest en route. They said we have to wait and see.

00:06:13.445 --> 00:06:16.085
All right. I'll stay and watch over things.

00:06:18.125 --> 00:06:19.485
Did you find our guy?

00:06:19.755 --> 00:06:21.495
Looks like he slipped out through a private gate.

00:06:21.555 --> 00:06:24.195
There's no CCTV. It seems he didn't come in that way.

00:06:26.795 --> 00:06:28.595
(Episode 8)

00:06:28.695 --> 00:06:30.865
So, what do you want to do?

00:06:31.605 --> 00:06:35.035
Well, anything that'll cheer us up.

00:06:36.035 --> 00:06:38.575
Something to blow off all this frustration and stress.

00:06:40.005 --> 00:06:41.015
Let's go.

00:06:53.755 --> 00:06:56.725
This is seriously the most fun I've ever had.

00:06:57.765 --> 00:06:59.525
I had a feeling we'd click.

00:07:00.265 --> 00:07:02.935
This is the first time I've ever been out this late.

00:07:03.865 --> 00:07:05.335
And I've never worn clothes like these before.

00:07:06.735 --> 00:07:08.835
So, are you feeling a little better?

00:07:09.875 --> 00:07:10.875
Yes.

00:07:11.175 --> 00:07:14.715
But it kind of feels like I'm doing something I shouldn't be.

00:07:15.145 --> 00:07:17.845
That's what makes it fun. It's a thrill, you know?

00:07:19.045 --> 00:07:20.045
Hold still.

00:07:24.925 --> 00:07:27.895
But is your face really okay?

00:07:28.425 --> 00:07:30.295
Yes, it's fine now.

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:32.295
That must have hurt so much.

00:07:32.925 --> 00:07:34.035
Who did that to you?

00:07:37.705 --> 00:07:40.635
Whoever it was, I'll have to make them regret it.

00:07:45.245 --> 00:07:46.245
Close your eyes.

00:07:55.585 --> 00:07:59.125
They'll probably come to regret it bitterly.

00:08:09.435 --> 00:08:10.495
Hello?

00:08:10.765 --> 00:08:11.765
Sang A?

00:08:12.335 --> 00:08:14.775
This is Yoon Ra Young, the attorney. You remember me, right?

00:08:15.435 --> 00:08:17.375
Where are you? Are you still out?

00:08:17.845 --> 00:08:19.075
Why? What is it?

00:08:20.675 --> 00:08:22.215
Your mom's been hurt.

00:08:22.815 --> 00:08:26.545
Don't tell anyone. Just take a taxi right now. Immediately!

00:08:29.255 --> 00:08:30.255
What's wrong?

00:08:31.225 --> 00:08:32.255
I'm sorry.

00:08:32.785 --> 00:08:34.095
I have to go right now.

00:08:35.325 --> 00:08:36.355
I'll call you later.

00:09:17.865 --> 00:09:20.935
Don't let anyone know you're here.

00:09:21.435 --> 00:09:23.205
And make sure you tell Sang A that too.

00:09:24.675 --> 00:09:26.675
I'll keep her out of school for a while.

00:09:27.875 --> 00:09:29.975
I'll have someone from my team posted here.

00:09:30.475 --> 00:09:34.415
You'll have to stay with them. It's the only way you are safe.

00:09:37.455 --> 00:09:38.455
And here.

00:09:40.055 --> 00:09:41.055
Take it.

00:09:54.235 --> 00:09:55.275
Thank you.

00:09:55.735 --> 00:09:56.805
Promise me.

00:09:58.545 --> 00:10:00.915
That you'll bring that jerk down for good.

00:10:04.045 --> 00:10:05.085
I will.

00:10:06.045 --> 00:10:07.115
I promise.

00:10:10.485 --> 00:10:11.655
I overheard you earlier.

00:10:14.225 --> 00:10:16.555
About the DNA sample you asked for.

00:10:17.795 --> 00:10:20.265
I never would've given it to Park Je Yeol.

00:10:21.195 --> 00:10:22.665
Not if I'd known...

00:10:24.065 --> 00:10:25.905
what Park Je Yeol did to you.

00:10:30.375 --> 00:10:31.405
I know.

00:10:46.255 --> 00:10:47.895
- Sang A. - Mom.

00:10:53.495 --> 00:10:54.535
What happened to your face?

00:10:55.195 --> 00:10:57.905
Did Dad do this?

00:10:59.035 --> 00:11:01.605
- I'm okay. - You call this okay?

00:11:03.335 --> 00:11:05.375
If only I hadn't gone out...

00:11:06.245 --> 00:11:07.405
It's not your fault.

00:11:08.015 --> 00:11:11.985
I'm sorry, Sang A. This will never happen again. I promise you.

00:11:22.455 --> 00:11:27.025
The number you have dialled is not available. After the beep...

00:11:30.395 --> 00:11:31.535
Sang A, it's Dad.

00:11:32.465 --> 00:11:33.905
Are you with your mom right now, by any chance?

00:11:35.275 --> 00:11:38.005
I don't know what your mom told you, but none of it is true.

00:11:38.475 --> 00:11:40.745
You know how your mom is, Sang A. She's not well.

00:11:41.145 --> 00:11:44.075
When she gets like this, we're the ones who have to help her.

00:11:44.685 --> 00:11:46.745
You know what I'm saying, right?

(Yoon Ra Young)

00:11:55.055 --> 00:11:56.055
It's me.

00:11:56.755 --> 00:11:58.695
She's with her mom, and they're safe.

00:11:59.795 --> 00:12:02.895
I'll file for a protective order. For the child too.

00:12:03.395 --> 00:12:06.065
I wouldn't try to contact or approach them if I were you.

00:12:06.435 --> 00:12:08.375
How dare you run off with my daughter?

00:12:09.535 --> 00:12:10.835
But you know, Ra Young...

00:12:11.545 --> 00:12:13.605
You know that's completely useless.

00:12:14.375 --> 00:12:16.075
You think the world's changed a lot, don't you?

00:12:16.775 --> 00:12:18.385
But you and I both know it hasn't.

00:12:19.185 --> 00:12:21.255
And you haven't changed either.

00:12:22.155 --> 00:12:23.455
You know what I mean, don't you?

00:12:23.915 --> 00:12:25.055
The one thing I know...

00:12:25.355 --> 00:12:26.755
is that I'm going to watch you crumble...

00:12:27.285 --> 00:12:29.495
with my very own eyes.

00:13:19.775 --> 00:13:21.275
You're here.

How are you feeling?

00:13:25.415 --> 00:13:28.585
I feel a bit better than yesterday, so they moved me here.

00:13:33.825 --> 00:13:35.925
Forget the victim for a second. I'm worried about you.

00:13:36.325 --> 00:13:37.995
You know you shouldn't be pushing yourself like this.

00:13:39.495 --> 00:13:41.195
When I think about what happened to Yoo Jeong,

00:13:41.835 --> 00:13:43.235
I can't rest easy.

00:13:49.205 --> 00:13:52.075
I'll stay here, so why don't you get some sleep?

00:13:59.185 --> 00:14:00.185
I'm sorry.

00:14:01.415 --> 00:14:02.915
I'm the one who did wrong,

00:14:03.315 --> 00:14:05.625
but you can't even bring yourself to hate me.

00:14:06.455 --> 00:14:09.095
Right now, just focus on your condition.

00:14:10.025 --> 00:14:12.925
I'm going to do my best to do the same.

00:15:22.965 --> 00:15:23.965
How bad is it?

00:15:24.435 --> 00:15:25.805
It's not looking good.

00:15:26.665 --> 00:15:27.665
Is that so?

00:15:28.435 --> 00:15:31.605
So what exactly happened?

00:15:31.905 --> 00:15:35.415
What's this about a sex trade app? Break it down for me.

00:15:36.115 --> 00:15:37.115
I'll tell you on the way.

00:15:57.265 --> 00:15:59.565
Go to the apartment. Stay on high alert.

00:15:59.735 --> 00:16:01.005
Yes, ma'am.

00:16:07.675 --> 00:16:09.575
This is better, right?

00:16:09.945 --> 00:16:11.285
We can't let them get us again.

00:16:14.145 --> 00:16:16.085
I did exactly what you said with the thing you gave me.

00:16:26.525 --> 00:16:28.395
The evidence implicating Park Je Yeol...

00:16:29.265 --> 00:16:32.365
- should all still be on here. - It's probably password-protected.

00:16:40.605 --> 00:16:42.445
I'll start by trying to crack the password.

You're a feisty one.

00:17:46.975 --> 00:17:48.875
What's happening? Is it being deleted again?

00:17:48.975 --> 00:17:51.175
Don't worry. I was prepared for this.

00:17:51.715 --> 00:17:53.845
They got me once, but they won't get me twice.

00:17:54.685 --> 00:17:57.555
No matter how they try to delete it, the data here is safe now.

00:17:57.615 --> 00:17:58.625
So don't you worry.

00:18:01.155 --> 00:18:04.325
But we do have one problem.

00:18:06.065 --> 00:18:08.595
There's a limit on the number of password attempts.

00:18:08.865 --> 00:18:11.965
If we fail too many attempts, the encryption key gets wiped.

00:18:12.205 --> 00:18:14.975
And then we can't decrypt the data, even if it's still there.

00:18:15.435 --> 00:18:17.945
- How many tries do we have left? - Three more.

00:18:18.205 --> 00:18:21.715
This method is too risky, so I'll try to find another way in.

00:18:40.825 --> 00:18:44.395
How am I supposed to take this?

00:18:45.365 --> 00:18:49.735
This is a faithful execution of our contractual obligations.

00:18:52.005 --> 00:18:53.645
This suspension of services...

00:18:54.615 --> 00:18:55.945
without any prior notice?

00:19:06.055 --> 00:19:07.685
The security and safety of our members...

00:19:08.495 --> 00:19:10.525
supersedes all other terms of the contract.

00:19:11.265 --> 00:19:13.425
That was the core of our agreement, after all.

00:19:13.865 --> 00:19:17.495
And that's the very reason you chose to partner with me.

00:19:20.405 --> 00:19:22.805
This sounds like a rather precarious situation.

00:19:23.435 --> 00:19:26.105
We're not at a green light, but it's not a red light either.

00:19:26.475 --> 00:19:29.145
Rest assured, and please be patient.

00:19:31.615 --> 00:19:34.715
And why should we keep trusting you?

00:19:37.815 --> 00:19:40.625

00:19:41.085 --> 00:19:43.195
Because they'll be completely sunk before they can.

its age limit was never revised, correct?

00:28:50.675 --> 00:28:51.675
(Do Jun)

00:28:55.545 --> 00:28:56.545
Do Jun.

00:28:57.245 --> 00:28:58.785
I think you should come to the apartment.

00:29:04.615 --> 00:29:06.025
How much longer do you think it'll be?

00:29:06.955 --> 00:29:11.155
I don't know. We only have one shot left.

00:29:12.225 --> 00:29:14.725

("Kim Jae Won's Quest")

00:29:51.095 --> 00:29:52.535
You didn't think I had it in me, did you?

00:29:53.305 --> 00:29:54.535
Just like 20 years ago.

00:29:55.005 --> 00:29:56.335
You thought I'd just run away, didn't you?

00:29:57.005 --> 00:30:00.705
Do you have any idea what you've just done?

00:30:02.145 --> 00:30:03.145
I know perfectly well.

00:30:03.645 --> 00:30:07.545
You were right. You broke me. But that doesn't mean you beat me.

00:30:09.385 --> 00:30:10.815
I think I've changed.

00:30:12.225 --> 00:30:13.285
I wonder if the world has too.

00:30:19.965 --> 00:30:20.965
("Kim Jae Won's Quest")

00:30:54.925 --> 00:30:55.965
(System, Password attempts remaining: 1)

00:30:58.495 --> 00:31:01.605
The illegal prostitution app? So we just have to get in, right?

00:31:02.205 --> 00:31:04.035
We only have one attempt left.

00:31:06.045 --> 00:31:07.045
Let me take a look.

00:31:07.345 --> 00:31:08.375
Yes, sure.

00:31:18.855 --> 00:31:20.125

00:31:23.895 --> 00:31:25.665
So? Think you can crack it?

00:31:26.925 --> 00:31:29.695
Yes. It's not like I have a choice.

(Decryption pipeline)

00:31:34.835 --> 00:31:37.775
Even for Baek Tae Joo, this is going to be tough.

00:31:38.875 --> 00:31:42.575
It looks like the server is blocking access to the app entirely.

00:31:43.475 --> 00:31:45.075
If we fail just one more time,

00:31:46.485 --> 00:31:47.515
it'll really be game over.

00:31:48.045 --> 00:31:52.385
The usual way won't work. We need another solution, fast.

00:31:54.055 --> 00:31:55.055
I think I'm in.

00:31:55.355 --> 00:31:57.125

Da Eun?

00:32:30.755 --> 00:32:32.465
My name is Hwang Hyeon Jin. I'm an attorney.

00:32:33.165 --> 00:32:34.165
Can you hear me?

00:32:42.635 --> 00:32:43.935
No, that's impossible.

00:32:44.675 --> 00:32:46.645
I've been stuck on this for days.

00:32:47.305 --> 00:32:49.145
No, I'm telling you, with conventional methods,

00:32:49.715 --> 00:32:51.145
it's impossible to get in.

00:32:51.615 --> 00:32:52.985
Exactly. That's why...

00:32:53.585 --> 00:32:57.815
I modified the attempt counter and the device block check routines,

00:32:57.885 --> 00:33:00.085
then repackaged it to bypass the authentication.

00:33:00.925 --> 00:33:02.155
You did all that just now?

00:33:03.755 --> 00:33:05.295
How did you even test that?

00:33:05.595 --> 00:33:08.195
- Mind if I take a look? - Yes, of course. Go ahead.

00:33:16.905 --> 00:33:17.975
So, did that help?

00:33:21.405 --> 00:33:23.075
I don't really do regrets.

00:33:24.045 --> 00:33:25.545
Rather than dwelling on the past,

00:33:26.015 --> 00:33:28.015
I'd rather take a single step forward.

00:33:31.885 --> 00:33:33.225
But I think I would've regretted it...

00:33:34.025 --> 00:33:35.355
if I hadn't taken your hand.

00:33:44.065 --> 00:33:45.065
See? I told you.

00:33:46.705 --> 00:33:49.335
That we'd make a great team.

00:34:25.305 --> 00:34:26.305
You're back?

00:34:29.745 --> 00:34:30.745
I told them.

00:34:32.515 --> 00:34:33.785
I told them everything.

00:34:36.415 --> 00:34:38.385
It took me way too long, but...

00:34:40.385 --> 00:34:41.385
I finally did it.

00:34:53.235 --> 00:34:54.535
Did you put up a good fight?

00:35:00.245 --> 00:35:01.245
This is for...

00:35:02.415 --> 00:35:04.945
the 21-year-old you.

00:35:09.385 --> 00:35:10.455
You've been through so much...

00:35:11.055 --> 00:35:12.255
to get here.

00:35:30.375 --> 00:35:31.875
What are people saying?

00:35:34.375 --> 00:35:35.375
So now,

00:35:36.945 --> 00:35:37.975
what's going to happen?

00:35:39.485 --> 00:35:40.745
Whatever the outcome,

00:35:41.815 --> 00:35:43.155
we'll face it together.

00:35:45.285 --> 00:35:46.285
You know that, right?

00:35:50.125 --> 00:35:53.725
Today, let's not look anything up,

00:35:54.265 --> 00:35:55.395
and try not to think about it.

(Incoming call)

00:36:40.405 --> 00:36:41.405
Yes, hello?

(We're rooting for you, Attorney.)

00:36:50.585 --> 00:36:53.255
What is all this?

00:37:00.095 --> 00:37:01.125
Look.

00:37:04.595 --> 00:37:08.565
Attorney, it's me, Han Yu Jin. You remember me, right?

00:37:09.105 --> 00:37:11.905
I was only able to take the stand...

00:37:12.005 --> 00:37:15.075
because you stood by me and gave me courage.

00:37:15.605 --> 00:37:17.145
Now I'm returning that courage to you.

00:37:18.575 --> 00:37:19.585
All of this...

00:37:20.845 --> 00:37:23.715
is from our clients?

00:37:24.115 --> 00:37:26.025
Looks like broadcast viewers sent them too.

00:37:26.455 --> 00:37:29.255
I've gotten more than my fair share of funeral wreaths,

00:37:30.525 --> 00:37:33.165
but this is a first for us.

00:37:34.565 --> 00:37:36.435
I did some digging on my way over,

00:37:36.795 --> 00:37:38.795
and all the talk about us online has completely vanished.

00:37:39.105 --> 00:37:41.665
Everyone's going crazy over Connect and Park Je Yeol.

00:37:42.605 --> 00:37:44.375
The stage is perfectly set.

00:37:46.445 --> 00:37:47.905
Then it's time to bring out the guillotine.

00:37:58.755 --> 00:38:01.125
(The people's police: Here to serve and protect)

00:38:02.495 --> 00:38:03.955
The evidence is ready.

00:38:04.625 --> 00:38:06.995
You can't trust the cops. Or anyone. You know that.

00:38:07.795 --> 00:38:08.895
Come alone, and be discreet.

00:38:09.395 --> 00:38:10.835
Got it. I'm on my way.

00:38:11.135 --> 00:38:12.135
Hey.

00:38:13.705 --> 00:38:14.705
Where are you off to?

00:38:18.375 --> 00:38:19.445
Hello?

00:38:19.505 --> 00:38:23.645
The admin account access logs and server logs were also there.

00:38:23.915 --> 00:38:26.615
We also found financial details and orders to procure victims.

00:38:28.915 --> 00:38:31.615
This is more than enough evidence to put Park Je Yeol away.

00:38:31.755 --> 00:38:34.555
Solicitation of murder, solicitation of statutory rape,

00:38:34.625 --> 00:38:37.795
money laundering, and running a criminal enterprise.

00:38:38.455 --> 00:38:40.765
He won't be seeing the light of day for a very long time.

00:38:41.895 --> 00:38:44.535
What about the users? Was their information on there too?

00:38:44.935 --> 00:38:46.405
Not for now. It's encrypted.

00:38:46.835 --> 00:38:49.435
But once we secure the server, they say we can trace everyone.

00:38:53.005 --> 00:38:54.005
That must be him.

00:38:58.275 --> 00:38:59.285
Hello.

00:39:01.015 --> 00:39:02.915
I told you to come alone.

00:39:03.315 --> 00:39:04.315
Come on, you know.

00:39:05.285 --> 00:39:06.325
You know you can trust him.

00:39:07.455 --> 00:39:08.755
Hyeon Jin, how have you been?

00:39:09.525 --> 00:39:10.595
Are you holding up okay?

00:39:12.665 --> 00:39:13.665
Come in.

00:39:13.925 --> 00:39:14.925
Thanks.

00:39:25.505 --> 00:39:26.505
The evidence?

00:39:27.375 --> 00:39:28.375
Right here.

00:39:28.675 --> 00:39:30.675
When will the investigation start?

00:39:31.045 --> 00:39:32.175
We need to lock him up fast...

00:39:32.245 --> 00:39:34.815
- so he can't do anything more. - Now that we've broken the story,

00:39:34.885 --> 00:39:36.285
the police will have to act quickly.

00:39:37.185 --> 00:39:38.255
Everybody freeze.

00:39:39.625 --> 00:39:40.885
What do you think you're doing?

00:39:43.525 --> 00:39:44.655
Have you lost your mind?

00:39:46.465 --> 00:39:49.695
You know, right? These are live rounds. Okay?

00:39:50.265 --> 00:39:53.035
Let's do this the easy way. And no one gets hurt.

00:39:53.635 --> 00:39:56.775
Seon Kyu, bring that to me. Come on.

00:40:11.355 --> 00:40:15.425
You're sure you won't regret this, aren't you?

00:40:16.055 --> 00:40:17.925
Darn it.

00:40:18.725 --> 00:40:20.325
I really don't want to do this either.

00:40:20.595 --> 00:40:23.465
But what choice do I have? This is how it turned out.

00:40:24.565 --> 00:40:26.205
Give it to me. Now.

00:40:27.505 --> 00:40:28.505
Hurry up!

00:40:32.805 --> 00:40:34.105
What do you think you're doing?

00:40:34.505 --> 00:40:36.515
Shoot me! Go on, shoot!

00:40:38.015 --> 00:40:40.685
Shoot me, or I'll kill you. Shoot!

00:40:40.745 --> 00:40:41.845
You jerk...

00:40:56.395 --> 00:40:57.595
From the very beginning, you...

(Firearm use permit confirmation, Name: Kim Seung Jin)

00:41:17.455 --> 00:41:21.155
You're arrested for destroying evidence and aggravated threat.

00:41:21.855 --> 00:41:25.155
You have the right to remain silent, and the right to an attorney.

00:41:26.225 --> 00:41:29.995
When you asked me to come with you, was this your plan all along?

00:41:30.265 --> 00:41:32.135
I was hoping it wouldn't come to this.

00:41:32.835 --> 00:41:35.205
Seung Jin. You jerk.

00:41:35.905 --> 00:41:38.675
Gosh. It's Team Leader Jang. Hold on.

00:41:40.075 --> 00:41:41.745
Even when I saw your burner phone,

00:41:42.845 --> 00:41:45.245
even when you pulled that stunt at Lee Seon Hwa's crime scene,

00:41:46.445 --> 00:41:47.685
I wanted to believe you.

00:41:48.415 --> 00:41:49.415
That I was wrong about you.

00:41:59.795 --> 00:42:02.365
- Here he comes! - He's coming!

00:42:03.465 --> 00:42:06.405
Are you being booked for running the Connect In app?

00:42:06.465 --> 00:42:08.005
Police were also involved in running the app.

00:42:08.065 --> 00:42:09.875
Who are the high-ranking officials who used the prostitution app?

00:42:09.935 --> 00:42:10.935
Do you have any comments?

00:42:11.005 --> 00:42:13.405
Did you sexually assault someone 20 years ago?

00:42:21.545 --> 00:42:22.545
Prosecutor Park.

00:42:22.885 --> 00:42:24.715
I didn't think you were coming in today.

00:42:24.915 --> 00:42:27.555
Why? Did I file for a day off?

00:42:29.425 --> 00:42:30.495
What's on my schedule today?

00:42:31.495 --> 00:42:33.565
What time is the interrogation for the Mujin-dong case suspect?

00:42:35.795 --> 00:42:39.905
- About that... - You haven't cleared your desk yet?

00:42:40.465 --> 00:42:41.965
Isn't anyone going to clean up in here?

00:42:42.405 --> 00:42:45.475
Gosh, the stench is so bad you can smell it from outside.

00:42:49.145 --> 00:42:51.375
I knew you were getting reckless.

00:42:52.175 --> 00:42:53.585
It seems your final stop...

00:42:54.485 --> 00:42:55.485
(Prosecutors' office)

00:42:56.455 --> 00:42:57.685

The number you have dialled is not available. After the beep...

00:43:58.615 --> 00:44:01.515
Sir. We can still get out of this.

00:44:01.745 --> 00:44:06.185
The only evidence they have is the data they pulled from my phone.

00:44:06.255 --> 00:44:07.725
If we challenge it as illegally obtained,

00:44:08.025 --> 00:44:09.955
it will be ruled inadmissible.

00:44:10.655 --> 00:44:14.865
But what if the girls come forward to testify as victims?

00:44:14.925 --> 00:44:16.565
They saw our faces.

00:44:16.835 --> 00:44:20.365
The only one they have is that girl from the Magan Hotel.

00:44:20.465 --> 00:44:23.135
And even then, she was drugged when she was matched with us,

00:44:23.605 --> 00:44:25.105
so she won't remember a thing.

00:44:25.575 --> 00:44:29.675
You see how quiet the others are, don't you?

00:44:29.815 --> 00:44:31.375
Who's going to step up and talk?

00:44:32.075 --> 00:44:35.145
The entire country would find out what was done to them.

00:44:35.685 --> 00:44:39.655
They're probably hiding somewhere, quiet as mice.

00:44:40.325 --> 00:44:45.225
Yes. We also figured we wouldn't be implicated.

00:44:45.955 --> 00:44:47.625
You know how these things go.

00:44:48.095 --> 00:44:50.895
People will make some noise for a while,

00:44:51.365 --> 00:44:54.135
but they forget all about it if it doesn't concern them.

00:44:55.535 --> 00:44:59.035
If you could just help us get through this...

00:44:59.175 --> 00:45:02.505
No, I think you're misunderstanding me.

00:45:03.045 --> 00:45:06.715
You can't dodge the arrow. Nor should you.

00:45:07.985 --> 00:45:09.315
What are you...

00:45:09.715 --> 00:45:12.615
The arrow's already been fired. Someone has to take the hit.

00:45:13.585 --> 00:45:16.325
I trust you're not foolish enough...

00:45:16.925 --> 00:45:18.725
to make an enemy of all of us.

00:45:20.265 --> 00:45:24.265
It's a shame you're taking the fall, not LnJ.

00:46:25.995 --> 00:46:27.265
What happened to your face?

00:46:27.765 --> 00:46:28.765
Are you okay?

00:46:30.165 --> 00:46:31.295
It's nothing.

00:46:32.265 --> 00:46:34.305
Are you okay, Attorney?

00:46:36.875 --> 00:46:38.175
I mean, after the broadcast.

00:46:38.735 --> 00:46:39.875
I saw it too.

00:46:42.875 --> 00:46:44.275
You weren't surprised?

00:46:44.915 --> 00:46:48.515
I didn't mean to expose Connect like that.

00:46:50.355 --> 00:46:52.215
It was bound to happen eventually.

00:46:56.895 --> 00:46:58.125
And...

00:46:58.825 --> 00:46:59.865
you heard, didn't you?

00:47:00.665 --> 00:47:02.495
Everything else I said on there.

00:47:11.375 --> 00:47:16.045
To be honest, it's still agonizing, and I'm terrified.

00:47:17.875 --> 00:47:22.045
If the nation were reading the diary I planned to take to my grave,

00:47:22.115 --> 00:47:23.285
this is what it would feel like.

00:47:26.885 --> 00:47:28.085
But you know, Min Seo...

00:47:29.325 --> 00:47:32.555
For the past few days, I've been sleeping so soundly.

00:47:33.425 --> 00:47:34.765
For the 1st time in 20 years.

00:47:36.465 --> 00:47:42.865
I now realise it's because I fought for myself.

00:47:45.805 --> 00:47:48.245
I was the one who was hurt. I was the victim.

00:47:49.745 --> 00:47:53.545
I deserved respect, to be cared for and to receive an apology.

00:47:54.085 --> 00:47:59.885
But for 20 years, I just abandoned that wounded part of myself.

00:48:00.755 --> 00:48:02.325
All because I was afraid of what people would think.

00:48:06.695 --> 00:48:08.025
So what's your point?

00:48:10.935 --> 00:48:13.065
Why are you telling me all this?

00:48:13.165 --> 00:48:17.505
I just wanted to tell you, Min Seo.

00:48:18.375 --> 00:48:19.905
That even though it's hard and I'm scared,

00:48:20.475 --> 00:48:24.645
I feel like I can finally move on to the next chapter of my life.

00:48:27.115 --> 00:48:28.945
What's the point of any of that?

00:48:31.355 --> 00:48:33.425
Does that make what happened to me just go away?

00:48:35.355 --> 00:48:36.855
It's the same for you, isn't it, Attorney?

00:48:39.055 --> 00:48:41.565
Can you clear all this away and go sleep in your room right now?

00:48:42.795 --> 00:48:46.435
No, you can't. You're too scared someone might be outside your door.

00:48:46.765 --> 00:48:48.705
From there, you have a clear view of the whole house.

00:48:50.075 --> 00:48:54.345
And can you live without all these extra locks?

00:48:54.705 --> 00:48:56.815
Can you leave the house without your stun gun?

00:48:57.775 --> 00:49:00.585
No. I bet you can't, Attorney.

00:49:02.315 --> 00:49:04.855
I'm the same way. I'll have to live like this forever.

00:49:05.015 --> 00:49:07.955
Scared, in agony, wanting to die, and plagued by nightmares.

00:49:09.385 --> 00:49:12.755
But at least, we can stop it.

00:49:13.265 --> 00:49:18.035
So that others like me won't suffer nightmares forever.

00:49:20.865 --> 00:49:22.635
Unless I can make them suffer exactly what they did to me...

00:49:23.875 --> 00:49:24.875
No...

00:49:25.505 --> 00:49:27.975
Unless I can make them suffer even more,

00:49:29.475 --> 00:49:30.945
none of it means anything to me.

00:49:33.145 --> 00:49:34.215
Thank you for the meal.

00:49:44.955 --> 00:49:49.625
Prosecutor Park, tied to the scandal for running the sex app Connect In,

00:49:49.935 --> 00:49:52.035
has appeared at the Mujin District Prosecutor's Office.

00:49:52.865 --> 00:49:56.005
When asked by reporters if he admits to the allegations,

00:49:56.065 --> 00:49:57.975
- Darn. - he offered no comment and...

00:49:58.035 --> 00:50:00.345
- entered the office stone-faced. - The nerve of that guy...

00:50:00.445 --> 00:50:02.345
Look at him, waltzing in with his head held high.

00:50:07.785 --> 00:50:10.555
Better get used to it. You'll be seeing a lot more of that.

00:50:12.485 --> 00:50:13.785
How's Da Eun doing?

00:50:14.425 --> 00:50:15.585
She's doing much better.

00:50:16.085 --> 00:50:19.555
But she can't seem to remember any of the details.

00:50:20.765 --> 00:50:24.395
I was hoping we could get a lead on the users.

00:50:32.005 --> 00:50:34.305
- Yes. - There's a call for you, Attorney.

00:50:35.005 --> 00:50:36.245
Put them through, please.

00:50:38.815 --> 00:50:42.015
Attorney Yoon Ra Young, LnJ Law Firm. How may I help you?

00:50:46.855 --> 00:50:47.855
Hello?

00:50:49.995 --> 00:50:53.765
I'm calling because I saw you on TV.

00:50:56.565 --> 00:50:57.565
I'm...

00:50:58.535 --> 00:51:00.165
a victim of Connect.

00:51:07.105 --> 00:51:09.445
Hello? Are you still there?

00:51:09.505 --> 00:51:12.575
Yes. I'm listening. Please, go on.

00:51:55.825 --> 00:51:57.095
Attorney Yoon Ra Young?

00:51:59.695 --> 00:52:00.765
You've come to the right place.

00:52:29.955 --> 00:52:33.365
I know how difficult it must have been for you to come here.

00:52:34.295 --> 00:52:37.235
Thank you for being so brave.

00:52:41.665 --> 00:52:43.105
Actually, that time...

00:52:45.205 --> 00:52:48.075
when you were on TV talking about Connect,

00:52:50.215 --> 00:52:52.615
I really struggled with what to do back then too.

00:52:54.215 --> 00:52:55.615
But I was just too scared.

00:52:58.655 --> 00:53:01.425
But I realised if I don't do anything,

00:53:02.085 --> 00:53:05.925
those people will just keep doing those horrible things.

00:53:06.695 --> 00:53:10.295
I have to stop someone else from going through the same thing.

00:53:12.865 --> 00:53:13.905
That's why I'm here.

00:53:15.765 --> 00:53:21.445
Do you happen to remember any of the users?

00:53:22.205 --> 00:53:24.645
A face, a name, anything like that.

00:53:27.285 --> 00:53:28.485
Those men...

00:53:29.685 --> 00:53:34.385
were very careful to hide their identities.

00:53:36.225 --> 00:53:39.625
I didn't recognise anyone just by their face,

00:53:40.865 --> 00:53:43.635
but I might recognise them if I saw a picture.

00:53:46.265 --> 00:53:47.605
The app's been deleted,

00:53:49.205 --> 00:53:52.035
so all I have left is my memory...

00:53:53.505 --> 00:53:56.305
Is that enough to make them pay?

00:53:58.445 --> 00:54:02.015
Su Eun, your testimony is powerful evidence on its own.

00:54:02.785 --> 00:54:07.785
But to secure a conviction when other evidence is scarce,

00:54:08.125 --> 00:54:13.125
we need consistent testimony from other victims as well.

00:54:13.665 --> 00:54:17.235
So, are there others who have reached out?

00:54:20.565 --> 00:54:25.675
A few other victims said they would come forward, actually.

00:54:30.745 --> 00:54:32.645
But no one's shown up yet?

00:54:44.095 --> 00:54:45.095
Su Eun.

00:54:46.395 --> 00:54:50.135
How long were you standing outside our office?

00:54:52.665 --> 00:54:53.865
About five minutes.

00:54:55.305 --> 00:54:57.005
That's common here.

00:54:57.935 --> 00:55:02.905
Most people have a hard time coming in for the first time.

00:55:12.915 --> 00:55:14.555
It's only a few steps,

00:55:15.885 --> 00:55:19.095
but crossing that threshold...

00:55:20.225 --> 00:55:23.425
can sometimes take all the courage a person has.

00:55:33.945 --> 00:55:35.045
It's cold out.

00:56:13.515 --> 00:56:17.255
Let's wait a little longer. They might just need more time.

00:56:18.155 --> 00:56:19.155
Okay.

00:56:25.825 --> 00:56:28.825
Looks like raising all that hell was worth it.

00:56:30.195 --> 00:56:31.195
Come on in.

00:56:39.005 --> 00:56:41.645
Attorney, I'm here because I saw the broadcast.

00:56:42.405 --> 00:56:43.575
Me too.

00:56:46.815 --> 00:56:49.345
Everyone, thank you so much for coming.

00:56:50.685 --> 00:56:51.885
Please, have a seat over here.

00:57:25.585 --> 00:57:26.955
Let me make you all a promise.

00:57:28.555 --> 00:57:29.955
To protect every one of you,

00:57:34.225 --> 00:57:37.395
we will do everything in our power.

00:58:00.285 --> 00:58:04.055
(Honour)

00:58:55.605 --> 00:58:58.045
A scandal that will shake the nation to its core.

00:58:58.645 --> 00:59:00.745
You think they'll even bat an eye at this?

00:59:00.845 --> 00:59:02.885
The green hoodie. Apparently, they're Han Min Seo's.

00:59:03.245 --> 00:59:04.385
Issue an APB. Now!

00:59:04.685 --> 00:59:06.785
Do you really think you can handle making an enemy of us?

00:59:07.055 --> 00:59:08.755
I'm not the one who raised the stakes.

00:59:09.055 --> 00:59:11.825
I've always been a firm believer that justice will prevail, ma'am.

00:59:11.995 --> 00:59:15.495
- My mom is the one making a move. - What in the world did they want?

00:59:15.995 --> 00:59:17.095
Where are you right now?

00:59:17.695 --> 00:59:19.895
- If you want to know, come find me. - What is this?

00:59:19.965 --> 00:59:22.035
- We're with the Joint Task Force. - You can't come in here.
