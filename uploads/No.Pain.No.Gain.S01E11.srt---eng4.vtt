00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.220
=Episode 11=
(This story is purely fictional.)

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.300
What's going on?

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.390
I think it's here.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.190
I think this should be the place.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.180
It looks like it.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:09.740
Hello.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.620
Did Lu Zhiyao

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.510
come to this farm before?

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:13.990
Farm?

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.620
Do you mean the garden?

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.620
Is this the private kitchen
at Mingyun Villa?

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.420
Why isn't there a restaurant name?

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.180
Lu Zhiyao was here, right?

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.300
Lu Zhiyao was...

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.300
Look. It's this place!

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.230
Yao's farm is inside!

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.420
Yes!

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.460
Everyone!

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.300
This is the farm Lu Zhiyao visited!

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.500
(Lu Zhiyao)

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.420
Let's go!

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.420
Go!

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.110
What are you doing?

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:42.420
All of you!

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:43.830
No!

00:02:43.968 --> 00:02:44.813
You can't come in!

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.070
All of you have no reservations!

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.830
No! You can't come in!

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.110
Someone!

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.420
Help!

00:02:50.791 --> 00:02:51.902
Someone!

00:02:51.924 --> 00:02:53.346
You can't make reservations today!

00:02:53.346 --> 00:02:54.830
You can't come inside!

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:56.740
Stop!

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.420
Mr. Pei!

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.620
What's going on?

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.620
Mr. Pei, help!

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:25.860
Are you okay, Chef Lin?

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.350
Who are all these people?

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.270
Why did Lu Zhiyao

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.990
upload a photo

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.510
of himself at the private restaurant?

00:03:41.902 --> 00:03:43.110
That's from a long time ago.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.670
Zhongdian Web Fiction

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.300
hasn't been doing well,

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:47.830
and I noticed his fans

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:48.950
love his posts,

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.110
so I made a deal with him

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.324
and got him to upload a post.

00:03:51.368 --> 00:03:52.670
He uploaded the post yesterday,

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.790
and it's trending until now.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.620
Lu Zhiyao is reading again.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.790
Nobody cares, okay?

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:59.670
Oh my god.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.420
Top three.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:02.950
He's a trendsetter.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.110
He attracts views.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.550
But his fame didn't benefit

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.550
Zhongdian Web Fiction.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.350
Instead,

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:09.830
he managed to viralize the restaurant.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.300
I guess my efforts didn't go to waste.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.550
Yeah, good job.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.300
His fans

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.860
don't look like bookworms to me.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.260
They're into selfies and photos.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.670
If Lu Zhiyao could go viral,

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.150
why not Shi Huo?

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.110
I think that guy's got potential.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.110
Look at the comments.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.550
It says,

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.060
"Isn't that the handsome genius

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.110
from the other class?"

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.300
"Hubby.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.350
Those who say the stars look beautiful
have never seen your eyes."

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.300
"Nonsense. Where are his eyes?"

00:04:37.457 --> 00:04:38.910
They're arguing in the comments, look.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:39.670
No, thanks.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:40.740
That's too scary.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.860
"If I knew he were in Jinchuan,
I'd have gone there.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.820
So, where's the private restaurant?"

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:47.900
(Mingyun Villa)

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.420
These netizens really found it?

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.380
They can search for anything.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.740
Impressive.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.420
No wonder Mr. Pei wasn't sad at all.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:00.550
He even came to cheer us up.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.300
He was banking on the restaurant.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.990
He must have seen this coming.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.740
He's good at holding surprises back.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.260
Despite the challenges,
he's built a successful restaurant.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.060
I can't drag Tengda down.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.180
I must find a way

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.860
to make my project succeed.

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:16.180
Bye.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.740
Huang is right.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.670
We can't let our game fall into hiatus.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:22.740
No action, no progress.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:23.860
There must be a way.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:24.670
Let's get to work.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.860
Come on.

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:44.380
Zhang Wang.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.260
Even the restaurant is picking up.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.260
We can't do worse than that, right?

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.420
We need to work hard.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.990
What do you think the gym

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.860
and the phone booth have in common?

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.060
Call Tian Mo.
We need to meet and discuss.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.820
Goodness, what in the world is this?

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.260
They're trending again.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:08.300
Pei Qian got Lu Zhiyao

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.260
to promote his nameless private kitchen.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:11.860
I knew it.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.110
He had an ulterior motive
for venturing into showbiz.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.820
Customers are actually
flocking over to that deserted hill.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.500
Did you see the news?

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.740
Yes.

00:06:22.346 --> 00:06:24.110
In the era of information technology,

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.500
he's just heaping resources.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:35.500
No.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.420
No...

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.110
I think I get it.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.860
This guy is deep.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.860
He's not just heaping resources.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.990
He's doing cross-industry marketing,

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.500
you know?

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.470
He's integrating resources.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.380
Mr. Li Jr.

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.110
Are you sure Pei Qian thought of that?

00:06:58.860 --> 00:06:59.860
Incredible.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.550
Such heights.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:06.260
No way.

00:07:06.657 --> 00:07:08.180
I've already reached amazing heights,

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.620
and I never even thought of that.

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:12.550
Pei Qian.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:16.300
What kind of heights have you reached?

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.060
Hello, this way.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.990
So pretty.

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.740
Yeah.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.110
Zhen.

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:29.860
Put this at the back.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:31.380
(Loving Zhiyao is an attitude.)

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:32.060
Come on.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:32.990
Selfie.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.180
(No Photographing)

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:42.990
No photos.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.990
Seriously, no photos?

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:46.060
They're crazy.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:46.670
Let's go.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:47.740
Excuse me.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:48.990
Do you have a reservation?

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:49.860
Yes, we have.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:50.990
Zhen, come here.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.110
Usher the customers in.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:53.060
Hello, this way.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:53.670
Thank you.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.110
Mr. Pei.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:01.620
So,

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.860
our customers are very enthusiastic.

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.740
What's more,

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.524
they've been using
the reservation system

00:08:06.524 --> 00:08:07.110
as we asked.

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:08.380
This means they can accept

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.380
our current model.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:09.990
This is great.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.620
So,

00:08:11.702 --> 00:08:13.235
should I report to you

00:08:13.257 --> 00:08:15.260
our income for the past two days? Okay?

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:18.670
Mr. Pei, I can see

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:20.740
you're not in the mood to talk.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.860
Enjoy some wine and fresh air.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.110
Take a break.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.620
I need to get back to work.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.500
Zhiyao took that photo here!

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.620
It's here!

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:30.380
Come on!

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.990
(Zhiyao is the best!)
Let's take some photos!

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.950
Come on!

00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:38.340
(Zhiyao is the best,
he aces every test!)

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.070
Li Shi?

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.470
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:45.260
You...

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:46.350
You saw through me?

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:47.260
Come on.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.260
Was I too obvious?

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.350
You're here to spy on us?

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.380
No.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:56.740
I noticed that you

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.740
have done a good job turning the tide,

00:08:58.740 --> 00:08:59.780
so I'm here

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.140
to learn from you.

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:04.260
Mr. Li.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.020
If you want

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.950
to replicate our business model,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.380
as an honest businessman,

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.260
I must tell you responsibly

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.860
that our business model

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.110
cannot be replicated

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:16.500
because it's purely based on luck.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.660
Mr. Pei, you're too modest.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:23.860
As far as I know,

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:25.310
you've invested a lot

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:26.380
in this private restaurant.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:27.860
If there's no substance,

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.860
why would you persist until now?

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.500
I'm telling you. Since I was a kid,

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:33.502
I've been studying MBA.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.540
So, I can tell there's something here.

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.710
Mr. Li.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:44.230
If you must

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:45.990
replicate our business model,

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.830
how about this?

00:09:47.146 --> 00:09:48.213
Let's exchange numbers.

00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:51.080
When you open your restaurant,
I'll bring some friends over to support.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.740
Mr. Pei, how generous of you.

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:53.380
Sure.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.720

I was too careless.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:09.620
To think a puny person like Lu Zhiyao...

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.500
You're not going to ruin my plan.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:15.660
Thank goodness

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.430

Mr. Pei, bad news!

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:28.620
I'm telling you...

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.110
Are you okay?

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.740
Sit down.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.590
There's a new private kitchen in town.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:34.830
Oh.

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:36.380
Oh?

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.500
That's all you have to say?

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.620
It was called Ming House.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:41.613
Lately, they renovated

00:10:41.635 --> 00:10:43.260
and got renamed as Ming House Banquet.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.380
They also have
a vegetable and fish farm.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:46.990
It's obvious that they're copying us.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:48.860
Wait, let me call to confirm.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:49.990
Call who?

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:52.990
Li Shi?

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:54.860
Since when did you add his number?

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:57.620
He...

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:58.380
Hello?

00:10:58.620 --> 00:10:59.950
Mr. Li Jr., I wanted to ask

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:00.990
if Ming House Banquet

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:02.260
is yours?

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:03.380
Yeah, Mr. Pei.

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.310
You keep saying you don't care,

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:07.260
but you've been keeping an eye on us?

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.620
Who's keeping an eye on you?

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:09.260
Why would we?

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:09.740
Who are you?

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:10.260
Shameless!

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:10.990
What the heck?

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:11.500
You jerk!

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:12.110
No.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:13.860
We're calling

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.190
to congratulate you.

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.990
Call you next time.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:19.260
So,

00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:22.620
since when did you become friends
with him behind my back?

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.860
What do you mean?

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:27.620
He kept asking me about our restaurant,

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.380
so I figured out he's opening one, too.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:32.380
Clever.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:33.500
I realized that Li Shi

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:34.768
and Zhou Muyan are the same.

00:11:34.791 --> 00:11:35.990
They're both copycats.

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.740
Shameless jerks.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.990
Ming House Banquet?

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:40.380
More like Hell's Banquet!

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:40.860
Well...

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:41.380
Disgusting.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.740
Let's get everyone

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.110
to go there.

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:45.500
It's time for me

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.900
to settle some scores with them.

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.190

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:49.260

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:53.190
Got it!

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:54.860
Congratulations, Mr. Gao!

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:55.990
Lucky catch!

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:58.230
Try catching another one.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.620
Mr. Wang, what do you think?

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.480
You can fish your own fish
and cook it here.

00:12:02.524 --> 00:12:03.950
Isn't it a novel idea?

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:04.860
Not bad.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.780

What kind of look is that?

What rights?

Let me remind you.

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:05.900
Is your

restaurant

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:08.110
copying

What's with that outfit?

We're here to eat.

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:18.500
Don't worry, Mr. Pei.

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.470
I'll get rid of him today!

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:25.900
I get it.

to sabotage my place,

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:32.380
right?

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:33.880
I'm telling you, if that's the case,

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:35.140
we don't welcome you.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:36.260

Yeah.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:59.140
By the way,

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:01.780
you found out

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.590
that it was Pei Qian who took over

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:04.740
our gym, Xingniao?

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:05.350
Yeah.

DreamForge Capital,
which bought the gym,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:08.620
is owned by Pei Qian.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.020
See, he's into

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:13.780
restaurants

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:14.780
and Internet cafes.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:16.260
Both were profitable.

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:18.430
This shows that he's got substance.

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:21.500
When he noticed

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:22.740
Xingniao Gym was doing badly,

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:23.860
he automatically

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.380
took our problem into his hands.

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:26.310
Today,

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.900
my private banquet is open,

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.590
and he's here to support me.

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:31.500
I guess

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:33.660
he's not really that hostile

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:34.500
towards us.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:36.500
I think so, too.

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:46.500
Hello?

Mr. Li Jr.

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:49.070
I just received news

that it was Pei Qian

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.430
who bought Xingniao Gym.

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:52.950
Is he

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:54.780
trying to rob us clean?

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:55.860
Muyan.

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.260
Your news travel slow.

00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.660
Besides, I think your word choice

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.260
is inaccurate.

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:03.470
How is he robbing us clean?

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:05.020
In fact, he's doing us

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:06.380
a huge favor.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.140
Mr. Li Jr., what do you mean?

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:09.710
You're getting the wrong idea.

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:16.620
Pei Qian.

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:23.020
You're constantly surprising me.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:49.300
(We are finding a driver for you.)

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:07.910
Ma Yang.

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:09.580
Ma Yang.

00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:12.260
We haven't talked for days.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:13.780
Why are you so mad at me?

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.230
The Tang poet Bai Juyi wrote,

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.540
"Heaven and earth
may cease to exist someday,

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:21.020
but this hatred
shall remain indefinitely."

00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:22.990
Ma Yang.

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:25.260
Listen to me.

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:27.300
Li Shi and I

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.990
are not what you think.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:31.580
The Tang poet Yuan Zhen wrote,

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:33.780
"When you've seen the ocean,

00:17:33.791 --> 00:17:35.300
even rivers would look like puddles."

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:39.740
Ma Yang.

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:41.990
I know you've been holding
a grudge against Li Shi

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:43.257
because of the Internet cafe.

00:17:43.257 --> 00:17:44.500
I went to his restaurant

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.740
simply because their food is expensive.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.020
The Song poet Lu You wrote,

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.060
"In the palace you sit,

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.500
surrounded by wine and luxury.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.060
The wind has thinned our love.

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:56.470
My nostalgia

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.820
has pained me for years.

00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:59.340
Alas, alas, alas!"

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:03.820
The modern poet Ma Yang says,

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.020
I dedicated my heart

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.500
to the moon,

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:09.630
but the moon would rather

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:11.060
shine at the gutters.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.060
(Game Over)

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:19.300
(Dead)

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:23.300
I have decided.

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:25.540
I will duke it out with Li Shi

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:28.020
in the venture capital industry.

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:35.740
Ma Yang.

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:37.910
Looks like you've been
reading ancient poetry.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.820
Ever since we developed
Returning to Shore,

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.260
everyone in Tengda

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.780
has become more cultured.

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:44.260
So what?

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:45.780
After I finish this,

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:46.950
I'm going to write

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:48.580
a new investment proposal.

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.230
Tengda won't be just

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:53.820
making waves in poetry.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:55.630
In the venture capital industry,

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:56.500
we'll beat the crap

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:57.780
out of Fuhui

00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:59.020
and Li Shi.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.060
I'll show them

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:02.500
who's the god-tier investor

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.780
in all of Jinchuan.

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:05.500
Nice!

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.470
Eat slowly.

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:09.820
Once you come up with a proposal,

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:11.260
I'll be behind you all the way.

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:12.470
But now,

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:14.190
we already have the phone booth project

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:15.990
and Sloth Gym.

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:17.300
DreamForge's quota

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:18.390
for this quarter

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:19.300
has been used up.

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:20.813
Ms. Xin wouldn't approve new projects.

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:22.990
Otherwise, I would've
let you invest more.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.150
It's all because

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:26.740
our investments failed.

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:32.470
Don't be so pessimistic.

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:34.060
I told you.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:37.060
You can't forge dreams overnight.

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:41.740
I will persist.

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.740
One day, you will see

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.990
your dreams blossom.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:47.580
Exactly.

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.820
(Moving on to local news.)

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:53.060
(Let's look at the next story.)

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:54.820
(Lately, shared phone booths)

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:55.870
(built across Jinchuan)

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:57.820
(has become a sensation among youths,)

00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:59.390
(turning into viral spots)

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:01.500
(on social media.)

(Its inventor Zhang Wang said)

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.060
(Jinchuan Phone Booths go viral)

(Shared Phone Booth)
(for the city's youths.)

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:12.020
Qian, you're right!

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.580
My dreams

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:14.820
have blossomed!

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.460
(Grilled Cold Noodles, 35 yuan)

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:29.390
What kind of grilled cold noodles
would cost 35 yuan?

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:33.020
Sir.

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:34.150
Want to buy a bag?

00:20:34.302 --> 00:20:35.540
Your girlfriend would love it.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:36.990
Look at this.

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:37.780
Top quality

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:38.780
and trendy design.

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:40.780
Come on, I can give you a good deal.

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:42.860

Dude.

00:20:54.702 --> 00:20:55.635
Want to get a number?

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:57.260
What number?

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:58.230
For the phone booth.

00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:58.990
30 yuan for one.

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:00.346
50 yuan for two, absolutely genuine.

00:21:00.635 --> 00:21:02.780
There are even scalpers
for this dumb phone booth?

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:04.260
Get me a number.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:05.780
I've been coming for days,

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:06.780
and I haven't gotten one.

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:07.990
Me too.

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:09.300
Look at the line today.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:10.457
I don't think I can get in.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.260
Not to mention
the other 18 booths over there.

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:13.910
The 18 booths over where?

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:15.820
At Fanshen Road.
There are probably fewer people,

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.457
(Shared Phone Booth)
but it's not ready yet.

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:19.470
I'll scan to pay.

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:20.020
For two?

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:20.780
Yes.

Excuse me.

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:55.990
Ruan Guangjian?

00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:59.260
Mr. Pei.

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:00.430
Are you here to console me?

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:01.780
Why would I?

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.020
Anyway, perfect timing.

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:04.235
Just finished the final touches.

00:22:04.257 --> 00:22:05.540
What do you think of this beast?

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:06.910
Why are you drawing this?

00:22:06.946 --> 00:22:08.702
Ma Yang and Zhang Wang,
do they know this?

00:22:08.724 --> 00:22:09.500
Of course.

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:11.500
I was officially commissioned
by Returning to Shore.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.540
Lin Wan helped me.

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:13.500
I know.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:13.870
I mean,

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:15.710
why are you drawing here?

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:16.780
Mr. Pei.

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.020
Lin Wan told me all about it.

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:19.780
You got Lu Zhiyao to promote

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:20.780
your private kitchen.

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.060
Your cross-promotion campaign

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:24.260
is awesome.

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:26.260
We didn't even think about it.

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:27.020
So,

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:28.390
I'm here to apply a new skin

No way!

I don't even know

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:41.060
how this dumb booth got viral.

she had nowhere to go.)

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:57.500
(So, she sought refuge
at a phone booth.)

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:13.710
I will go back to office

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:15.430
and solve this issue.

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:17.430
Okay.

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:19.230
Don't worry.

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:21.710
Got it.

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:47.150
(Everyone says)

00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:49.500
(our phone booths
are like treeholes in the city)

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:51.190
(that soothes the heart.)

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:53.100
(Now, it's gone viral.)

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:55.020
(It's even become a tourist attraction.)

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:58.100
Everyone's stressed out.

00:25:58.100 --> 00:25:59.100
This is a great place.

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:00.740
No matter how rowdy the city is,

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:01.670
we can still have

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:03.190
a safe, personal space

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.740
where we can

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:06.300
make calls, gossip,
and complain about our bosses.

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:07.710
Anything is fine.

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:08.470
It accommodates

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:10.020
our youths' mental desires.

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:11.230
I must say,

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:11.820
Mr. Pei,

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:13.150
you have a keen eye

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:14.470
for investment.

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:16.950
Guangjian.

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:17.870
Go get some rest.

00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:19.190
Let me destress inside.

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:20.430
Sure.

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:27.990
Mr. Pei!

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:29.910
That's right!

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:31.190
Vent it all out!

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:34.230
That's right!

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.950
Excuse me.

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:36.950
It's Mr. Pei!

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:38.670
Mr. Pei is here?

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.190
You're awesome!

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:45.257
- We want to play, too!
- Me too!

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:46.230
Sorry.

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:47.710
This phone booth

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:49.190
is still under renovation.

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.950
That's right.

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:51.950
If you want to vent out...

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:52.950
What else can you do...

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:54.670
Here's a free voucher for you.

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.791
(Sloth Gym, FREE)
Head to Sloth Gym and try out

00:26:56.835 --> 00:26:57.950
all our services for free!

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:05.950
Calm down.

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:08.150
I need to calm down.

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:11.470
There's still Sloth Gym.

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.760
(Sloth Gym)

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:16.670
Come on, let's do this.

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:17.260
Yeah.

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:18.100
Come on.

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:18.950
Wait.

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:20.470
Take that!

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:21.670
See?

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.950
That's your trump card?

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:24.100
Genius.

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:24.670
Pass.

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:25.857
I've been reserving this card.

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:27.430
I'll take it.

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:32.150
I got it.

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:34.630
Anyone else?

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:43.470
Here.

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:44.500
Have some tea.

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:45.630
Come on.

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:56.470
I hope I get a good card this round.

00:27:57.670 --> 00:27:59.950
I love this flavor, but it's sold out.

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:00.740
Let me try.

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:04.150
Peace.

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:11.180
(Don't be angry.)

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:15.190
I can't take it anymore!

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:16.870
Take that, you jerk!

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:17.740
(Jerk)

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:22.340
(Jerk)

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:23.740
Tian Mo, Li Yaling!

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:24.950
Where are you?

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:27.740
Mr. Pei, you're here.

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:33.950
Calm down.

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:35.670
Everyone's napping.

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:38.470
Welcome to Sloth Gym.

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:39.950
Peace.

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:02.340
Mr. Pei!

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:03.260
Mr. Pei.

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:04.150
Mr. Pei.

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:05.260
Mr. Pei.

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:07.820
Peace, peace...

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.360
(Shenhua International)

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:21.150
Can anyone tell me

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:22.910
what happened?

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:24.740
Why did things turn out this way?

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:34.190
The phone booths

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:36.710
and Sloth Gym
were doing badly before, right?

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:38.190
Ma Yang, is your mouth

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:39.260
feeling constipated today?

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:41.430
Here's the thing.

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:43.950
I was inspired by Lu Zhiyao.

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:46.740
He promoted the restaurant, right?

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:48.190
So, I talked to Tian Mo

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:50.430
and decided to launch a cross-promotion

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:51.710
between Sloth Gym

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:53.710
and the phone booths.

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:55.710
Then, the phone booths went viral,

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:57.060
and so did

00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:57.500
Sloth Gym.

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:01.430
Mr. Ma made a swift, wise decision.

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:03.540
Zhang Wang.

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:05.230
Mind your words.

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:07.260
We're just executing

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:08.710
Mr. Pei's

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:10.190
visionary ideas.

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:11.670
Mind your words.

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:12.820
Yes.

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:15.710
Forget about the phone booths.

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:17.670
How did the gym go viral?

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:19.710
It's not even a gym anymore.

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:21.990
It's all because of
your wise decisions, Mr. Pei.

00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:25.020
Again?

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:25.990
What's it

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:27.950
got to do with me?

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:30.230
You created the business model.

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:31.950
We didn't understand back then,

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:33.430
but now we do.

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:36.100
Now, everyone's promoting
healthy lifestyles,

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.813
but no one's got the energy to work out

00:30:37.835 --> 00:30:38.950
after a long day at work.

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:40.150
However,

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:41.470
Sloth Gym

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:42.710
provides the solution

00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:44.710
to help everyone achieve their gym goals

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:46.670
while relaxing the body.

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:47.950
It's two birds with one stone.

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:48.990
Mr. Pei.

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:52.470
Our client base is the same.

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:55.710
Whether it's the phone booth users,

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:57.910
the gamers,

00:30:58.150 --> 00:30:59.390
or our customers

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:01.190
at Sloth Gym...

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:02.449
If you keep talking like that,

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:03.780
I'll beat your head off your neck.

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:05.710
Basically, we just

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:07.670
integrated our client base.

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:11.300
Why didn't anyone tell me?

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:14.150
Everyone was busy...

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:14.950
Busy?

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:17.740
You have time to set up 18 phone booths,

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.470
but no time to tell me?

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:27.020
Mr. Fei...

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:28.580
It's Pei.

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:30.430
Mr. Pei, here's the thing.

00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:32.670
The phone booth is running
on a franchise system.

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:33.950
We already have a franchiser.

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:34.710
DreamForge Capital

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:36.190
mainly provides

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:37.910
sales and assembly services.

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:39.710
The franchiser manages the operations.

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:41.710
That's why we could branch out quickly.

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:43.910
Where did the franchiser come from?

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:45.950
Even I was amazed.

00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:47.430
He came to us

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:49.670
to offer his support.

00:31:58.670 --> 00:31:59.390
Mr. Li Jr.

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:00.990
It's Mr. Pei.

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:02.390
Mr. Pei?

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.020
(Mr. Pei)

00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:09.430
Friendships

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:11.500
are often built

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:13.820
unknowingly.

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:16.500
(Mr. Pei)

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:22.230
Hello, Mr. Pei.

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:23.710
What is it?

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:26.470
Mr. Li Jr.,

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:27.260
why did you

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:28.950
invest in the phone booths?

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:30.740
Why not?

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:32.470
Mr. Pei.

00:32:32.857 --> 00:32:34.457
Thanks for supporting Ming House Banquet

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:36.190
as well as Xingniao Gym.

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:37.820
You were a great help.

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:39.540
You deserve my gratitude,

00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:40.470
and I, Li Shi,

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:41.740
am a grateful man.

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:42.670
That's why

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:44.710
I invested a little money

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:46.710
into your phone booths.

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:49.430
Take it as my token of gratitude.

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:51.430
Xingniao Gym?

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:54.710
Naughty boy.

00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:56.430
Even now,

00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:58.190
you're still going to deny that you knew

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:00.260
Xingniao Gym was mine?

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:08.670
Mr. Pei.

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:11.710
We had some misunderstandings
in the past,

00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:13.340
but now I understand

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:16.300
you've never treated me as an enemy.

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.990
Mr. Pei.

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:18.390
I shall remember

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:19.950
your friendship.

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:21.910
No matter what people say about you,

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:23.950
I will support you.

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:25.260
Mr. Li Jr.,

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:26.670
please don't.

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:29.100
I don't expect anything in return.

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:31.630
I know.

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:34.060
Mr. Pei, you have a keen eye.

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:35.500
So, I just want to collect

00:33:35.813 --> 00:33:37.100
some scraps along the way.

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:39.260
Now that your gym

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:40.500
and phone booths

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:41.820
have gone viral,

00:33:41.902 --> 00:33:43.035
I called some contacts,

00:33:43.146 --> 00:33:45.060
and we've got dozens
of interested franchisees

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:46.500
from all over the country.

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:48.500
Mr. Li Jr., there's been some sort

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.060
of serious misunderstanding between us.

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:51.470
I've been trying to explain,

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:52.430
but you refuse to listen.

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:53.300
I'm being honest now.

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:54.470
I never wanted to earn money.

00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:55.470
If I did,

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:56.630
that's purely coincidental.

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:57.630
Don't follow blindly,

00:33:57.630 --> 00:33:58.230
got it?

00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:59.670
I totally get it,

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:00.060
Mr. Pei.

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:01.300
You don't.

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:03.740
My achievements today
are all based on pure luck.

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:06.020
Taking one correct step,
that's pure luck.

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:08.060
But taking every step correctly?

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:09.020
What's that?

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:09.750
Bad luck.

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:17.540
I know

00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:19.870
you're wary of

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:20.910
other investors.

00:34:20.910 --> 00:34:22.790
That's why you often

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:23.580
talk ambiguously.

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:25.020
I can understand.

00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:27.060
But I'm different.

00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:31.580
I can totally understand you.

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:32.700
And I think

00:34:32.910 --> 00:34:33.790
smart people like us

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:34.660
should work together

00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:35.910
and make an impact

00:34:35.910 --> 00:34:36.580
on the market.

00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:38.100
Together, we can expand

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:38.620
the market!

00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:42.830
Like what I said,

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:44.180
Mr. Pei,

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:45.750
you can take the meat,

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:46.750
and I'll just

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:48.660
collect the scraps.

00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:51.270
You like collecting scraps?

00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:52.540
Are you a garbage collector?

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:57.870
I don't care whether
I collect garbage or scraps.

00:34:58.500 --> 00:34:59.270
Anyway,

00:34:59.702 --> 00:35:01.635
I'm looking forward to working with you.

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:02.540
In the future,

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.830
I hope we can benefit each other

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:07.580
and make

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:08.140
big money.

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:10.180
Let's make big money!

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:13.540
Yeah!

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:21.990
Sibo?

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:23.390
Sibo?

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:24.180
Over here!

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:25.390
I'm here, Mr. Pei! Here!

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:26.830
Here!

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:29.430
Stand there!

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:31.500
Sibo.

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:33.950
Zhongdian Web Fiction
is my pillar of strength.

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:35.580
You won't betray me, will you?

00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:36.719
Mr. Pei, what do you mean?

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:37.910
You uncovered my potential.

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:39.280
I have only gratitude towards you.

00:35:39.324 --> 00:35:40.540
Why would I betray you?

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.480
There's nothing unusual
going on here, right?

00:35:42.524 --> 00:35:43.580
I can't afford to take

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:44.750
another blow.

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.660
Mr. Pei.

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:48.790
I may have to disappoint you.

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:50.270
We have published

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:51.830
our contract writers' fictions

00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:53.620
online, but the data

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:54.390
isn't promising.

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:56.910
Let me see.

00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:58.020
I was reading it just now.

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:01.430
Most of them haven't generated any hype.

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:07.060
That's great.

00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:10.660
Keep it up.

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:13.140
Mr. Pei.

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:15.500
The overall data is bad,

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:18.910
but there's still one fiction
that's made its mark.

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:21.310
It's called "The CEO
Has an Exclusive Crush on You".

00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:22.990
It's ranked No. 2 on the trending list,

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:25.470
and is generating positive income.

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:27.350
It's also attracting
lots of new readers.

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:30.270
What CEO is that?

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.470
It doesn't sound like

00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:33.910
what I asked you to write.

00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:34.750
Yes.

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:36.790
They're actually external submissions.

00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:38.220
I didn't pay much attention at first,

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:40.020
but it's been generating good reviews.

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:41.020
It's just that...

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:42.180
The story doesn't follow

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:44.390
our unconventional model.

00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:45.502
Mr. Pei, what do you think

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:46.430
we should do?

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:47.660
Remove it.

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:49.500
We've already published 101 chapters.

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:50.060
Look.

00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:52.100
Many netizens are asking us
to update quickly.

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:53.750
Remove it.

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.870
Mr. Pei.

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:58.540
If we remove it,

00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:00.350
the penalty fees would be high.

00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:01.350
Pay them three times.

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:04.100
By the way,

00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:09.180
you said that was No. 2 on the list.

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:12.270
What about No. 1?

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:15.470
Me.

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:18.750
I wrote a novel tied in
to Returning to Shore.

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:20.430
I...

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:21.270
Yes!

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:22.660
Mr. Pei.

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:24.060
It wasn't my idea alone.

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:25.990
It was Lin Wan who proposed it.

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:27.140
Huang.

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:29.270
I have an idea

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:30.430
about your web fiction.

00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:32.470
Why don't you write

00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:34.189
a tie-in story about Returning to Shore?

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:35.902
We're under the same company, after all.

00:37:35.924 --> 00:37:37.080
Let's connect everything

00:37:37.124 --> 00:37:38.390
and turn Returning to Shore

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:40.140
into a corporate IP.

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:41.180
First step,

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:42.750
a tie-in novel.

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:50.060
Great idea.

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:52.540
Let me try it out.

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:54.430
Don't tell Mr. Pei.

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.540
Mr. Pei, don't worry.

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:56.950
I followed the unconventional model

00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:58.540
you have instructed us.

00:37:58.540 --> 00:37:59.870
At first, we didn't get any views.

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:01.302
But when the game became viral,

00:38:01.324 --> 00:38:02.020
so did the novel.

00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:03.470
The game has gotten viral?

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:09.540
No. 1, Mr. Pei!

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:12.100
(Zhongdian Web Fiction)

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:13.700
He looks stronger

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:15.310
than he is.
