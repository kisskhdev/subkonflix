[Born to Be Alive]

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.180
[Episode 40]

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.120
Because you know

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.200
this type of oil...

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.000
isn't used on hinges.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.470
And the smell of gun oil...

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.340
is hard to mask.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.940
Yes.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.740
No matter how deeply you hide things,

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.010
you can't hide them forever—

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.910
like Wang Fumin's death

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.360
and the gun in Wu Jiang's car.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.570
Give me a way out.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.050
When you aimed your gun

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.329
at someone else,

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.460
did you ever consider
raising the muzzle just one inch—

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.860
to give them a way out?

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.600
Are you alright?

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:55.800
Get out of there!

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.050
Get out of there!

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:58.320
Chun...

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.130
Chun! Chun!

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.580
Chun!

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.730
Press down on your wound.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.110
Out of the way!

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.940
[Xinhai Coal Mine]

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:41.850
They went off-road.

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.310
Send the location to them.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:14.960
Pick it up now!

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.110
Step on it, Captain!

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.700
We're losing them!

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:24.440
Stop yelling!

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.400
The chassis is too low—

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.860
any faster and we'll flip!

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.630
Captain!

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:19.510
Get ready.

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:41.860
Fan, get down!

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.039
Bai Ju, take cover!

00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:58.430
Fan!

00:08:58.450 --> 00:08:58.910
Fan!

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:02.590
Gun!

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.050
Is this Emergency Services?

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:05.340
This is
the Criminal Investigation Detachment.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.340
We need an ambulance 30 kilometers west

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.600
of Xinhai Coal Mine.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.140
We have two people with gunshot wounds.

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:17.150
Did you kill Wang Fumin?

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:21.800
Yes.

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:25.480
Were you

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:28.170
connected to
Captain Duojie's disappearance?

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:29.900
Yes.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:36.210
Where is he?

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.270
Would you still

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.760
believe me at this point?

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:52.820
I wanted to believe you.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:56.080
Tell me,

00:10:57.830 --> 00:10:58.690
where is he?

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:00.870
I don't know.

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:07.350
I didn't...

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.440
I didn't kill Duojie.

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:22.220
Stop looking at him. Shoot!

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.670
Kill him!

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:43.430
I don't want to owe anyone any favors.

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.180
Whether you make it out alive

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:49.450
depends on your luck.

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:52.550
On my way back,

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.410
I found

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.830
Duojie's car parked on the road.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.010
To avoid being discovered,

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.650
I dragged Duojie's car

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.090
deep into the wilderness

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.540
and burned it.

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:56.350
Did you see

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:57.510
who took him away?

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.100
No.

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:01.830
I was too far away.

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:04.860
But...

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:07.130
I remember

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:09.870
the last digits of the plate—

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:11.810
5 and 8.

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:19.530
So...

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:22.100
So this is

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:23.930
how it all ends.

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:26.650
Maybe

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.650
the worst ending...

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:33.860
is actually the best one.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:38.710
Tonight...

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:42.810
I can finally

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.240
get a good night's sleep.

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:04.390
All these years,

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:05.840
I've done

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.720
many dirty deeds for Feng Keqing,

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:08.910
including the incident

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:10.320
at Qima'er Gold Mine.

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.620
The person who's been shielding
Feng Keqing all these years

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.350
is someone you'd never expect.

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:35.330
But you'll find out soon enough.

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:36.470
That's

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:38.480
all I can tell you.

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:24.750
I've already told you everything

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:25.980
about my family's

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:29.800
violations of laws and regulations.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.660
Violating discipline...

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:39.720
was indeed a momentary lapse of judgment
on my part.

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:43.190
I failed to
discipline and supervise my family.

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:45.570
Now, I am...

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:47.920
willing to accept punishment.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:48.960
Mr. Lin Peisheng,

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.730
today we're not here

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:51.810
about your family.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.450
It's about something else.

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:54.690
The police

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:56.100
need to question you.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:15.050
According to forensics,

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.750
a large amount of blood

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:17.960
was detected

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:19.650
in the gap

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:21.980
under the passenger seat of that Santana.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.600
Our investigation found

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:25.500
that the vehicle

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.700
was once registered under Feng Keqing,

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.980
then transferred to Lin Jianshe,

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:32.130
and then sold to a used car lot.

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:35.180
But when the car was sold,

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.240
Lin Jianshe had already gone abroad.

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:41.860
Do you have anything to explain?

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:45.720
It was me.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.460
I sold it in Lin Jianshe's name.

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:58.150
As for the blood...

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.460
He was shot at the time.

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:15.260
I never knew...

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:19.200
a human body...

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:23.720
could bleed so much.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:33.570
Back then,

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:35.780
Feng Keqing told me

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:38.320
he was going to kill Duojie.

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:40.870
I hurriedly took Lin Jianshe's car

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:42.800
and rushed toward the airport,

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:44.750
hoping to run into Duojie

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:46.170
and stop all this.

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:48.360
But...

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.030
I was still too late.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:02.350
Duojie?

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:03.880
Duojie!

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:05.220
Duojie!

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:07.200
Duojie?

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:11.440
Lin...

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:15.230
Let's go.

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.100
He was badly injured.

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:51.080
I just wanted to get him back
to the county town as quickly as possible.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:51.690
Duo.

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:53.980
Duo, hang in there!

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:55.050
I'm taking you

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:56.460
to Director Zhang right now!

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.610
I'm afraid even the real Dakini

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.890
couldn't save me now.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:05.800
Don't talk nonsense!

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:12.640
I know...

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:15.530
who wants me dead.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:18.660
You saw...

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:21.200
who shot you?

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:25.170
As soon as I got off the plane,

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:28.030
a man named

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:29.420
Feng Keqing

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:31.350
stopped me.

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:32.770
County Mayor Duo!

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:37.480
Hello, County Mayor Duo.

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:39.140
I'm Feng Keqing.

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:40.610
I'd like to talk to you

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:42.210
about developing Bolamula.

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.260
There's nothing to talk about.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:47.270
County Mayor Duo,

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:48.850
please take a look at this.

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.190
He said...

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:00.750
he knew the county officials well.

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:04.610
Do you know him?

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:08.790
I've seen him.

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:11.440
Runs a restaurant, I think.

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:13.970
He's not that simple.

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:19.530
He said Qima'er Gold Mine

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:20.490
was his...

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:24.570
and that Li Yongqiang worked for him.

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.680
He also showed me

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:30.820
a mining permit

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:31.340
for Bolamula.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:33.640
[Qinghai Provincial
Land Administration Bureau Document]

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:34.870
It has the seals of

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:38.140
the Provincial Land Administration Bureau

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:41.690
and the County Government.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.120
How did he get

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:51.590
those official seals?

00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:57.900
Duo?

00:22:59.090 --> 00:22:59.700
Duo!

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:01.810
Duo!

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.450
I conspired with my junior at university,
Huang,

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:14.310
to secretly stamp the Provincial
Land Administration Bureau's seal.

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:16.440
Regarding the County Government's seal,

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.070
I stamped it myself.

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:21.220
Even though I did all those things,

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:22.550
I still

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:23.960
wanted to get Duojie

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.240
to the hospital.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:27.090
But I didn't expect

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:29.250
my car to break down on the way.

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:32.500
Duo... Duo, hang in there!

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:33.570
I'll go fix the car!

00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:34.500
I'll push the car!

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:35.500
I'll go find help!

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:36.580
Don't bother.

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:38.630
In my condition,

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:40.490
I won't make it to the county town.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.260
I know

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:46.190
you were the one who stamped

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:47.780
the seals.

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:10.240
Clear water flows east...

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:15.090
muddy water flows west.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.810
Even if they come

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:21.490
from the same spring...

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.850
they won't flow together.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.920
Since we met

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.050
and started working together,

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:42.810
it's been 20 years, right?

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.720
To be honest...

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:56.060
I couldn't stand you at first.

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:01.730
You're younger than I am by...

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.480
by...

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:07.410
Three years.

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:15.710
Everyone else thought

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:17.770
that, as a college graduate, you were

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:20.830
calm and measured in your approach.

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:23.910
At the time, I was the only

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:27.170
one who thought, "This young man

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.350
is pretentious

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.570
and ambitious."

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:43.480
No wonder...

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:47.150
you didn't

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:48.510
talk much to me at first.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:51.750
I thought

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:53.410
you were just bad at Mandarin.

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:55.510
Later...

00:25:58.170 --> 00:25:59.430
we argued a lot.

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:02.810
That's when I realized

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:05.170
you spoke Mandarin very well.

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:12.330
We did fight a lot.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:17.870
But I know...

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.300
you are a good man

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:28.240
and a good official.

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:35.610
When herdsmen couldn't bear to sell
their yaks and sheep,

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:41.260
you said that
what we were taking from the grassland...

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.720
had exceeded its...

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.000
its...

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:51.730
Exceeded its carrying capacity.

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:56.630
Anything beyond that is destruction

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:57.610
and waste.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.910
So I know

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:09.660
your ambition

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:14.160
was never driven by self-interest...

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:21.960
but was for the herdsmen,

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:26.490
for the grassland—

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.590
not for yourself.

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:52.400
I...

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:58.300
I always thought

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:01.730
we were two rivers

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:04.880
taking different paths
but flowing toward the same sea.

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:12.710
Eventually, we would merge.

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:40.960
No.

00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:47.310
You don't like the smell.

00:30:58.330 --> 00:30:58.990
Dad?

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:14.260
Dad.

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:46.430
Dad,

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:48.410
where are we going?

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:49.690
To the grasslands.

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:51.460
Home.

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.150
After Duojie died,

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:17.170
I found

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.720
I couldn't explain

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:21.160
how I knew he would get shot.

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:22.820
I was scared

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:25.680
that my dealings with Feng Keqing
would be exposed.

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:28.290
So I decided to take his body

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:30.350
and bury it in the wilderness.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:03.890
These days,

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:05.550
I often think that

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:08.690
if Duojie were still alive,

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:12.740
he would definitely argue with me.

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:17.000
But every argument

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.040
would've been a kind of correction.

00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:21.740
After he was gone...

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:25.930
I made one mistake after another,

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.270
until...

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:31.650
there was

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:32.600
no turning back.

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:39.680
Those are all excuses.

00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:43.950
A person with true conviction...

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:46.560
doesn't rely on

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:47.730
someone supporting

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:50.920
or correcting them...

00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:56.280
but on the direction...

00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.860
of their own heart.

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:04.050
Environmental protection and development

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:05.580
have never been opposites.

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:06.700
It seems

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:09.570
you never truly understood that.
