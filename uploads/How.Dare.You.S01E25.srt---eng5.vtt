[How dare you!?]

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.020
[Episode 25]

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.259
Your Majesty.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.800
Your Majesty.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.870
The antidote.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.229
The antidote!

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.009
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:56.990
Give me the antidote!

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.850
Where is the antidote?

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.850
Give it to me now.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.010
Give it to me!

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:02.400
Hurry, give it to me!

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.560
Don't you want
your little Crown Prince to live?

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.790
-Give me the antidote!
-If anything happens to her,

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.780
all of you will die!

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.590
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.190
Your Majesty, please don't.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.840
You Xia people

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.870
will die a terrible death!

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.980
Where's the antidote?

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.690
-Give me the antidote!
-CEO Dan!

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.410
CEO Dan.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:38.329
Stop it.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:39.510
Let go now.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.980
CEO Dan.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.230
Dan...

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.720
We haven't eaten the hot pot
in the chamber yet.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.680
Mr. Bei made a hot and sour soup base.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.170
And we still have...

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.890
so many things we haven't done yet.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:01.520
Remember?

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.320
Look at me.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.590
Look at me.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.440
I'm going

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.680
home...

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.840
I'm going home...

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:42.630
It's all right.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.490
It's all right.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.490
Wanyin.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.980
Yes.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:00.750
Your Majesty!

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.930
Eunuch An.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:05.550
Yes.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:07.370
Stay here.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:09.680
Without my word,

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.750
the Empress Dowager has to stay alive.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:13.190
Yes.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.000
Imperial Physician Xiao.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.440
Yes.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.720
Take the little Crown Prince
back to the palace.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.779
Guard him closely.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.410
No one is to approach him!

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.750
Yes.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:21.930
Guards!

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.040
His Majesty has fainted from grief.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.160
Take him back to the palace quickly!

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.050
Your Highness.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.860
How is it?

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.720
Is the Empress Dowager dead?

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.370
There's a skilled young physician

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.570
who's helping to keep her barely alive.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.540
What about the Emperor?

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.890
The palace is in chaos.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.580
They say

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.800
the Emperor collapsed
from excessive grief.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.080
Even the little Crown Prince
fainted and was taken away.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.680
I knew that old thing

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.890
wouldn't die so easily.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.880
Perhaps this time

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.420
we won't even need to act ourselves,

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.050
and they'll fight
until both sides are destroyed.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.720
Wanyin.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.240
Are you alright?

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.600
Imperial Physician Xiao sent me a message

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.680
and told me what happened.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.720
I was terrified!

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:25.680
Are you okay?

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.800
I'm fine.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.970
It's CEO Dan.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.730
He's not doing well.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.240
I temporarily used acupressure

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.120
to stop the poison from spreading.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.380
But this poison is extremely dangerous.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.120
It will make him delirious
when it takes effect.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.590
Wanyin,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.330
please watch him for me.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.630
I need to test this poison powder again.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.240
It's all my fault.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.070
I knew the Empress Dowager
wasn't a good person,

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.600
yet I still wasn't on guard.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.080
I saw the Crown Prince
as soon as I entered,

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.840
but it never crossed my mind.

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:10.690
Don't blame yourself.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.170
Who would be wary of a young kid?

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:14.260
Besides,

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.230
you reacted fast enough.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.620
Most of the poison

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.180
was blocked by you.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.390
That's true.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.800
But how come nothing happened to me?

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.330
CEO Dan only touched a bit

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.840
and suddenly became delirious.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.890
I feel something's off,

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.020
but I can't figure out why.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.210
The poison knows who to poison.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.290
What do you mean?

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.090
I'm just guessing.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.350
It's the same poison,
but it only works on specific people...

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.190
The Crown Prince

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:51.490
must've sprinkled poison trigger on him.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:53.520
Poison trigger?

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:06.680
The Empress Dowager has passed away!

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.340
The Empress Dowager has passed away!

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:15.100
[Taiji Hall]

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.720
The Empress Dowager has passed away!

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.480
The Empress Dowager has passed away!

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.060
The Empress Dowager has passed away!

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.620
The Empress Dowager has passed away!

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.220
The Empress Dowager has passed away!

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:41.770
Wanyin.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:44.770
You're awake.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.700
Does your head still hurt?

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:51.890
Are you all right?

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:52.480
I'm fine.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.850
That powder wasn't poisonous.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.420
Not poisonous?

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.220
Then why did I...

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:03.910
Xie Yong'er reminded me.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:06.870
Do you remember what the Empress Dowager
said before she died?

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:09.270
That she regretted using the wrong poison.

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:11.260
I think she did say that.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.480
It was my bad luck.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.540
I chose the wrong poison.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:18.680
There are two parts to a poison:
the seed and the trigger.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.270
The Empress Dowager must have planted

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.270
the poison seed when you were young.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.190
Later,

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.570
she would periodically

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.290
administer the poison trigger on you,

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.610
gradually worsening your headaches,

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:33.200
making you unable
to control your emotions,

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.059
and turning you into
the tyrant everyone speaks of.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:38.390
You mean

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:42.179
what the Crown Prince sprinkled
was a poison trigger?

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:42.710
Exactly.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:45.800
That's why even though
I inhaled most of it,

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.000
I remained unharmed.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:48.840
But you only came in contact
with a little,

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.300
and immediately acted up.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.150
I just don't know

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.880
how she planted the poison seed in you.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:00.830
Empress Ci Zhen

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.130
had a very difficult time
during childbirth.

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:08.340
I fear I was born with it.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.230
So Xiahou Dan's fate...

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
was written before he was even born.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:28.000
So all my struggles

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:31.730
were meaningless.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.080
But he met you and me,

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.350
so it wasn't all for nothing.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.320
We've narrowed down the poison's origin

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.510
to the Qiang State.

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:43.970
Finding it

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:45.960
is just a matter of time.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.030
Wanyin.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.240
Thank you.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.690
On behalf of this unfortunate Xiahou Dan,

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.120
thank you.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.240
With the Empress Dowager dead,

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:22.700
Prince Duan's next target

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:24.600
will be us.

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:28.080
I forgot to tell you yesterday.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.720
News came from the border

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.610
that all three armies are mobilizing.

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.120
What we feared has come.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.380
Our worst suspicions are confirmed.

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:39.360
So,

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.840
before Prince Duan's reinforcements
arrive,

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:44.660
the Empress Dowager's funeral

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:46.450
must be expedited.

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:50.840
The Azure Dragon of the East,
the White Tiger of the West,

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.960
the Vermilion Bird of the South,
and the Black Turtle of the North—

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.750
each of these four celestial guardians
has seven mansions beneath them.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:01.360
Unfortunately, they all have conflicts
with the Empress Dowager's burial date.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:05.030
Even though the Empress Dowager
led a diligent life full of blessings,

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:07.410
we should not go against heaven's will

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.000
and disturb her peace.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.360
This newly appointed
Imperial Astronomer Director

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:14.710
speaks quite like Yang.

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:16.080
Of course.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:18.240
I wrote this speech.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.000
Didn't you transfer
to the Ministry of Personnel?

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.200
Why are you still
handling the Imperial Astronomer's affairs?

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.620
It's just a small favor.

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:25.990
Her Highness calls it

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:27.160
resource exchange.

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:28.240
Besides,

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:30.270
what if I need the Imperial Astronomy's
help in the future?

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:31.030

I have finally determined

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.150
that the 14th day of the 11th Lunar Month

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:41.080
is an auspicious day
that comes once in a hundred years.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.270
It's suitable for burial,

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:43.400

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.500

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.910
Good!

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:58.100
A good day indeed!

An auspicious day!

is just three days from now.

Mr. Chen,

I have none, Your Majesty.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.630

Your Highness.

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:30.170
May I have a word with you?

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.040
What is it?

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:50.010
Your Highness,

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:51.030
I have failed you.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.750
I've searched through all of
the Imperial Medical Bureau's books

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:57.350
but still couldn't identify
the exact components of the poison.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:16:59.980
I knew it.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.120
Whenever someone asks
for a word in private,

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.800
it's rarely good news.

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:07.970
But I haven't come empty-handed.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.130
Physician Xiao,

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.410
please tell me everything at once.

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:15.250
My apologies, Your Highness.

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:19.030
The poison His Majesty was exposed to
at Mount Bei

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:21.690
should have prevented
his wounds from healing,

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.050
yet he recovered remarkably quickly.

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:27.240
This time,
while most of the poison trigger

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.920
the Crown Prince released this time
was inhaled by Your Highness,

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.320
His Majesty still inhaled more than usual.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.130
Yet the headache

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:36.080
only occurred once that night.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:37.170
Therefore,

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:39.030
I have a bold idea.

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:40.550
Please continue.

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:42.110
Your Highness mentioned

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:43.920
fighting poison with poison last time,

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.160
which from a medical perspective

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:45.890
is feasible.

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:48.090
So if we can find

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:51.640
a poison that counteracts
the one in His Majesty's body,

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.300
I have a 50% chance of success.

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:56.590
I understand.

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:59.060
I'll send a message by carrier pigeon

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:00.790
and ask Tu'er to help us search.

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:03.120
I hope there's enough time.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.180
Your Highness's devotion to His Majesty

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.460
will move the heavens.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.300
I'm sure we'll make it in time.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.480
Physician Xiao,
you've always been straightforward.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.140
But now you're flattering me?

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:24.110
Physician Xiao, what are you doing?

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:25.410
Your Highness,

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:26.720
I dare

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.440
to make a request of you.

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:30.800
Go ahead.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.270
I see His Majesty trusts you greatly.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:38.750
After His Majesty

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.290
resolves the matter with Prince Duan,

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:42.440
could Your Highness

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.420
put in a good word with His Majesty

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.010
and ask him

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.130
to release Consort Xie?

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:50.580
You mean...

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:53.270
You mean Xie Yong'er?

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:56.800
You two...

00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:59.480
Your Highness, please don't misunderstand.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.510
My relationship with Consort Xie
is completely innocent.

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:03.030
It's just that day in the flower house,

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:04.630
when I first met Consort Xie,

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:06.080
she showed me kindness.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.260
She is such a wise and kind person.

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:10.070
I truly cannot bear

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.170
to see her wither
like those angelica plants,

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:14.310
fading day by day.

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:16.890
Therefore,

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:17.920
I beg

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.640
Your Highness to help her.

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:24.010
Physician Xiao, please rise.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.380
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:27.750
Yong'er is fortunate

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.280
to have a friend like you.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:35.800
Don't worry.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.580
We're thinking of the same thing.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.160
On the day of
the Empress Dowager's funeral,

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.070
after Prince Duan follows
the funeral procession out of the city,

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:47.270
I will send people to escort her

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:49.930
to leave the capital
in the opposite direction.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.130
By that time,

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.600
it will be too late
for Prince Duan to find her.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.530
The Emperor and I

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:59.110
don't know if we can
ultimately defeat Prince Duan.

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:00.960
So every additional day
Yong'er stays in this palace

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.360
is another day of danger.

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.450
Only by leaving this palace

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.880
can she truly be safe.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.200
So Your Majesty
and Your Highness have already...

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.610
I am ashamed.

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:14.000
I

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:16.730
will do everything in my power

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:18.610
to protect His Majesty from harm.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.340
You've reminded me of something.

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:26.740
Since parting is inevitable,

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.010
then her final memories

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.330
shouldn't just be the warmth in her hands.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.040
What did Physician Xiao say?

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:51.830
Today is the winter solstice.

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:53.090
Do you want dumplings?

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:54.640
Dumplings?

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.770
Your Majesty!

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:03.640
Why did you leave me?

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:15.910
Her Majesty has fainted from grief.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.300
Someone help take her back to the palace!

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.020
This is just dough.

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.360
You can only wrap it after rolling it out.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.720
What is this?

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:42.940
My buns.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.310
They're better than yours.

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:45.110
Look at yours.

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:46.310
The filling's coming out.

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:47.030
So what?

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:48.480
Don't you think it's novel?

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:48.940
Well...

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:52.680
I'm better than you.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:55.740
How so?

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:58.090
Given how I know my own incompetency.

00:21:58.830 --> 00:21:59.630
You know what?

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:00.830
It looks like you.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.940
But I did it according to how you look.

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:03.960
Stop!

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.360
All of you!

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.990
Get out of here.

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:08.670
Stop wasting my ingredients!

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:12.410
Everyone out! Did you hear me?

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:12.880
Move it!

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:27.830
This fish is not for eating.

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:29.160
You can look at it but not eat it.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.510
It symbolizes abundance.

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:31.110
Is that so?

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:32.750
Come, have some dumplings.

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:32.960
Here.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:33.480
Have some dumplings.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:33.960
Try them.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.160
What filling is this?

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:37.070
What filling don't you eat?

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.310
I don't eat pork.

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.910
It's pork.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.460
It's beef filling.

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:44.490
Delicious.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:46.480
Cen,

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:47.510
it's hot.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.310
Today is the winter solstice.

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:51.110
Have a drink to warm yourself up.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:51.840
All right.

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:54.060
Come on.

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:54.790
Well...

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:56.770
We're together again.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.840
I wish Cen good health.

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:01.400
And a speedy recovery.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.530
Thank you for your hospitality today.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.040
Thank you, Er Lan.

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:06.450
Come, drink up.

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:14.580
Have some more.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.750
One cup is enough.

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:18.790
Er, you…

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.280
why are you acting
like a controlling wife?

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:23.750
Yang,

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.200
you haven't even started drinking
and you're already talking nonsense.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.510
Today is the winter solstice.

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:29.440
We should drink until we're drunk.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:30.550
Besides,

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.840
Er's cooking skills are so impressive.

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:37.790
He can serve in court
and cook in the kitchen.

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:39.160
If you were a woman,

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:42.110
countless families
would be lining up to propose.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.750
Yang, what's gotten into you today?

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:46.640
-Why? Don't like hearing what I'm saying?
-Stop drinking.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.160
That's enough, don't drink anymore.

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.070
Come on, stop drinking for now.

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:49.130
What's the matter?

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:51.920
If you want to marry someone

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.730
just because she's good at cooking

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:56.030
rather than
for her personality and talents,

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:57.830
you might as well remain single.

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:58.830
Li is right.

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:01.310
When it comes to knowledge and wisdom,

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:02.640
gender doesn't matter;

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.160
only ability counts.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:06.690
Er.

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:09.070
Being a good cook is useless.

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:10.780
Can't you tell?

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:12.270
He's insulting you.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:13.580
Is that so?

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.080
Quite a harsh insult too.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:16.570
Hey, Cen, you...

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:19.490
See? He's half recovered.

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:20.950
Give me back my wine.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:22.600
Here.

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:26.200
Drink your wine.

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:29.370
Come on, let me pour it for you.

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:34.560
General!

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:35.410
General!

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.950
There's an urgent confidential message.

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:45.840
[The Empress Dowager's funeral will be
held on the 14th of the 11th Lunar Month]

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.050
[The advance party has gathered
at Mount Bei. The remaining troops]

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:49.920
[will arrive at the city gates in 5 days
to intimidate the Royalists.]

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:54.830
I knew it.

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:58.000
Once the Empress Dowager dies,

00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:00.750
Prince Duan would certainly make his move.

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.830
This kingdom

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:06.110
will likely fall into chaos.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:07.490
General,

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:08.460
should our Right Army

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.390
still be moving around in stealth?

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:14.750
Is that still necessary?

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:18.820
All three armies are already on the move.

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.160
It's just a matter of who's faster now.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.620
Dumplings with wine bring more prosperity.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.000
Dumplings with fish
bring abundance every year.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.510
One should hold the dumpling bowl
on the winter solstice.

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:30.840
Otherwise, you will freeze off your ears!

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:32.830
Here.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:33.920
Thank you, Mr. Bei.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:34.720
Thank you.

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:36.200
Time for dumplings!

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:37.920
Eat.

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:41.570
Thank you, Mr. Bei.

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:48.810
I just bit onto something.

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:49.760
What's wrong?

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:56.550
That's good luck!

00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:58.190
I wish

00:25:58.270 --> 00:25:59.510
everything goes as you wish

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:00.970
and peace year after year!

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:02.660
Mr. Bei.

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:06.070
I pay you respects as your junior.

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:07.560
Wishing you good health

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:09.030
and success in everything
in the coming year.

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:10.160
You shouldn't, you shouldn't.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.530
It's fine, Mr. Bei.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:12.500
Just accept it.

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:24.590
I found one too!

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:26.960
Yong'er.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.290
Then we wish you

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:30.590
a smooth departure from the palace

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:32.520
to see the world and find yourself.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:33.930
Thank you.

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:35.240
Xie Yong'er.

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:36.370
I thank you too.

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:38.640
All these talks are useless.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.950
When I leave the palace,

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:41.810
just give me enough travel money.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.100
My turn now.

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:45.350
Do I have one too?

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:51.560
Is there one?

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:57.470
Wait, Mr. Bei,

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:59.520
how many coins did you put in total?

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:02.420
There's one in every dumpling.

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:05.140
Luck is something

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.640
you need to make yourself

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:08.250
if you want it.

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:10.820
Then eat more.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.250
All your travel money is in the dumplings.

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:14.650
What a cheapskate!

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:18.100
It's delicious.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:20.430
Eat up.

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:24.320
[Tablet of the Mother of the Prince, Li]

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:53.970
Mother.

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:55.630
The dumplings are ready.

00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:59.710
Look at you.

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:01.610
You got flour all over your face.

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:02.380
Come here.

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.500
You look like a little kitten.

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:11.490
Mother.

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:12.550
You eat.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:14.780
You eat first.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:22.890
Mother.

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:24.830
What are you embroidering?

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:26.760
I'm embroidering a sachet for you.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.000
May it bless you

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:31.110
and keep you healthy every year.

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:40.420
Mother.

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:44.380
You've been gone for 14 years.

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:50.350
I think about you every day.

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:57.460
The sachet you embroidered for me,

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.950
I wear it every day.

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:16.740
Mother, please bless me with

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:20.280
triumph and success

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:23.790
tomorrow.

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:33.000
What do you want to do
after leaving the palace?

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.260
I want to travel and see the sights first,

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.880
then explore this world properly.

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:40.680
And then...

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:42.540
live in seclusion?

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.850
No way!

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.110
I want to wait
until you've stabilized the country,

00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:47.910
then get some royal investment.

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:49.720
What do you think

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:51.830
about me starting a business empire?

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:53.510
Look at you.

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:54.990
Truly the chosen one.

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:58.410
Do you have specific business plans?

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:02.050
I plan to develop a food delivery service,

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:04.840
starting with the city
as the foundation.

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:05.750
That's a good one.

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:06.950
I want to invest in it!

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.890
We could also do package delivery.

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:10.180
But transportation

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:11.750
is inadequate in this world.

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:13.010
We need to build roads.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.520
If I were to make cars,

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.880
would you invest?

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.110
Why not go all the way

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:21.240
and build a maglev tube system?

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:22.660
Maglev?

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:24.100
What's that?

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:25.670
Oh no,

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.600
when "Devil's Favorite Concubine"
was published,

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.660
maglev tubes didn't exist, did they?

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:32.580
I read about it in sci-fi novels.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.280
I can't explain it properly.

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:37.480
You want me to build something
from sci-fi novels?

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:38.940
You think too highly of me.

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.200
I'm just kidding.

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:45.790
You mentioned before

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:47.790
that in your world,
you lived in...

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:48.850
Where was it again?

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:50.350
Bei...

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:51.960
Bei...

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.360
Just a small county town.

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.820
You wouldn't have heard of it.

00:30:58.570 --> 00:30:59.170
All right.

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:01.770
By the way,

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:03.490
remember to

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:03.990
pass this letter to Xiao Tiancai

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:05.200
[To Xiao Tiancai]

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.530
after I leave tomorrow.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.530
You're friend-zoning him?

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.130
You're really friend-zoning him?

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:17.960
Don't make our dear Physician Xiao

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.590
so upset that he goes on strike.

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:21.460
It's not friend-zoning him.

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.490
I told you we're just friends.

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.600
You're overthinking it.

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:27.140
Fine.

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:29.030
I'll pass this to him.

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:34.830
Thank you.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.020
I never thought

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.590
the person I'd entrust something to

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:40.850
would be you in the end.

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:47.560
This plot

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:49.740
is like a wild horse running free.

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:52.470
At this point of time,

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:55.310
I really don't know where it's heading.

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.320
I'm not surprised at all.

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.400
We're from the same place after all.

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:02.650
We're like a mirror in this world.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:06.960
That's right.

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:09.610
I finally understand.

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:11.350
In this world,

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.530
having someone who understands me
like you do

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:16.550
isn't dangerous

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:19.910
but comforting.

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.070
Sis...

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.340
You're being so dramatic.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:39.830
All right.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.130
I'm leaving.

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:44.160
Don't forget to miss me.

00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:07.310
Wanyin!

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:12.820
It's a deal.

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:16.070
When I get my food delivery business
up and running,

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:17.450
you'll teach me

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:19.830
some specialty snacks from your hometown.

00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:20.370
Sure!

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:51.130
Your Highness.

00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:56.590
Your Highness.

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.610
Go and prepare.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:09.320
Yes.

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:15.239
Leave!

00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:38.560
I once said

00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:44.620
to prevent them from using foresight
to predict the future,

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:46.989
at a critical moment,

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:49.739
I would insert a small variable.

00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:53.800
Now, that moment has come.

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:16.710
These

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:19.030
were truly written by Consort Yu?

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:19.830
That's right.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:22.650
Even this sachet

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:26.020
was embroidered for me by her own hands.

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:32.070
What I'm about to say,

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:34.920
you must remember word for word.

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.360
That year at the Lantern Festival
flower market,

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.220
she was dressed

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:43.050
fully in plain white clothes,

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:46.920
yet her breathtaking beauty
could not be concealed.

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:49.850
At that time,
she had not yet entered the palace.

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:52.570
You two were deeply in love

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.440
and exchanged tokens of affection.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.150
You thought

00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:59.690
you would marry her and bring her home

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:01.000
to grow old together.

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.530
But who could have imagined her father

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000
was a vain man.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.710
For his own career,

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.360
he sent his daughter into the palace

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.440
to become a consort.

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:19.400
From then on,
separated by the palace walls,

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:22.610
you could not ease the pain of longing.

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:26.250
However, this woman was quite clever.

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:29.980
She became the Emperor's favored consort

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:32.910
and used some methods

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:36.970
to have you promoted to
Commander of the Imperial Guards.

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:39.230
From then on,

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:43.310
you had some convenient means to meet.

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:47.990
But you were not content—

00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:52.770
not content to sneak around forever
like this.

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:55.830
Moreover,

00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:59.410
she was pregnant with your child.

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:09.910
Such words

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:12.740
will cost me my life.

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:16.150
If you are unwilling,

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:20.790
I can send you out of the city tonight.

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.580
To live out your days

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:26.940
in a remote manor
doesn't sound bad at all.

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:29.950
Your Highness misunderstands.

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:34.540
Rather than live like a rat in the gutter,

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:37.430
I'd rather take a gamble.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.530
I'm betting that Your Highness

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:43.540
is the one chosen by destiny.

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.110
But will the Emperor

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:49.950
really buy this story?

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:54.960
Whether he buys it doesn't matter.

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:57.010
By that time,

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:01.720
all the civil and military officials
will be present.

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:05.600
Yu Wanyin's reputation as a seductress

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:08.280
will spread forever.

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:12.320
If Xiahou Dan shields her,

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.620
then he's blinded by lust.

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:19.290
He'd be an incompetent ruler.

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:21.920
In this way,

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:23.710
our military action

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:25.400
will be...

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.920
fully justified.
