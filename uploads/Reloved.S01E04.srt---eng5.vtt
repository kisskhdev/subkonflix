00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.451


00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:07.520
Yes.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.890
On the left?

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.890
Meya.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:15.830
Yes.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.500
I’m Akin.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.250
We talked on the phone.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.150
Yes.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.200
May I ask...

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.290
You…

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.520
We met three months ago.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.100
It was just a one-night stand.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.290
He told me he already had someone.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.380
What do you want?

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.750
We agreed on the phone to end it.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.350
But when I found out…

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.250
I just want him to know

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.440
before I decide anything.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.550
I’m not asking for anything.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.420
Have you talked to him?

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.810
I think it’s between you two.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.700
You two should talk directly.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.080
I only want to know
how this happened.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.860
Hello, Than. What are you doing?

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.130
Thinking about you.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.380
Stop teasing. Tell me.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.000
Just finished basketball practice.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:41.870
What time is it there?

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.820
Here? Almost eleven.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.710
Cold?

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.840
Very cold.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.650
So when are you coming back?

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.850
This coming Sunday.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.170
Oh, then school starts right away.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.480
It's okay.
Do you want anything from here?

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.480
Nothing. I just want to see you.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.360
So clingy. Have you been naughty?

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.560
No. I came back right
after practicing.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.810
And visited my parents. That’s all.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.040
Good. Good boy.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.900
- If I know you are...
- I’m always your good boy.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.990
Both in front and behind your back.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.460
You can trust me.

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:32.550
I should go now.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.840
That's my number.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.060
Tell me if you need help.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.710
Or should I not tell him?

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.740
Maybe it’s better
if he never knows.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.590
Then it ends for real.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.190
Cutting ties completely.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.450
It’s something only you can decide.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.200
I’d rather not comment.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.800
Excuse me.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:16.820
You live alone.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.950
And the room is so big.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.270
So I hope to ask you
for a place to stay.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.250
I think I found a new face
for this product.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.560
Get the girl named Nene
to be our model.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.260
Alright. I'll let her do it.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.980
- Good job.
- Well done, kids.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.850
Help me understand everything.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.720
I don’t know how to feel

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.909
to see you again like this

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.490
with your son.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.580
Not knowing might be better.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:01.610
How is he?

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.060
The doctor said
it’s nothing serious.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.820
But he wanted a full check.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.020
His head may have hit the ground.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.360
He will be fine.
He’s with the doctor now.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.580
Yes. Mawin will be fine.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.530
I’m sorry.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.870
If I hadn’t asked him to play,
this wouldn’t happen.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.810
It’s okay.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:28.420
It was an accident.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.350
No one wanted this.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.960
Are you tired from
shooting all day?

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.450
Take her home first.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.290
I want to stay with you.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.210
I want to wait for him too.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:45.440
Thank you.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.650
Take her home first.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.210
She must be tired.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.420
Alright. Let me know
if anything comes up.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.590
Nene.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.430
Let’s go home first.

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.680
Mawin, do you hurt anywhere else?

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.010
No, the doctor said not to worry.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.230
CT scan shows his head is fine.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.800
And the soft cast on his arm
will heal ina few days.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:45.370
Thank you, doctor.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.560
Please come to the counter.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.060
There’s medicine and
insurance papers to sign.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:53.310
Okay.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.120
Everything’s fine.
You two go ahead.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:58.560
She should rest.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.300
Alright, I’ll go now.

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.820
Goodbye, Uncle.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.660
Goodbye.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.420
I’ll go now. Get well soon.

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:13.450
- This way, please.
- Okay.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.380
- Mawin’s fine now.
- Sorry, where’s the finance desk?

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:44.670
Thank you.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.000
Mawin.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.050
Mom.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:12.750
How are you?

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.200
I was shocked when he called me.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.720
I’m okay. It hurt a lot at first.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.540
It barely hurts now.

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:23.600
I’m sorry I didn’t
watch him well enough.

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:25.850
It’s alright. Accidents happen.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:26.900
Kids are playful.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.040
Right? You were being playful, huh?

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.840
How about staying with me
while you recover?

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.400
Won’t you be busy?

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.150
I won’t. I have an assistant now.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.940
Good. I can hug you
every night again.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.810
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:47.220
Thought there’d be more of you.
It’s group work.

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:49.680
They all left already.

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:51.040
Just left a moment ago.

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.970
You guys drank too?

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.330
A bit. Celebrating the project.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:02.460
What happened to your neck?

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.810
Not sure. It’s itchy though.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.810
Let me see. Yes, what’s that?

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:17.430
We brought snacks to your room.

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:18.550
Ants were everywhere.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.830
Really?

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:20.370
Yeah.

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:24.150
I’m heading up first.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.410
Excuse me.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:27.050
See you.

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.510
Let’s go. Have you eaten?

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:32.770
Ants? Really?

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:34.850
Why does it look like that?

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:40.000
It was ants.
If not ants, then what?

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.850
I don’t know.
It doesn’t look like ant bites.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:45.700
Ants, really.

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:50.010
Her room had tons of ants.
They ate snacks.

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:52.330
So the ants swarmed the place.

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.430
I want the truth.

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.160
Who made that mark?

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:59.380
I told you — ants.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:02.460
You think I did something?

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:04.110
Anyone would think that.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:09.510
I’d never do that.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.380
You know how much I love you.

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.070
Why would I ruin our relationship?

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.080
Do you trust me?

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.580
Mm… I trust you.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.520
Don’t say that word.

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:25.180
Answer properly. Do you trust me?

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:29.720
Give me a kiss.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.130
I would never cheat on you.

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:36.440
Never even thought of it.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:37.800
Really.

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:40.930
Overthinking makes you age faster.

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:48.500
Smile like this lollipop.

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.840
Smile again.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:56.620
Wider. Just a bit more.
Wider smile.

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:57.080
Enough.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.480
Let’s go.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.850
Then I did this pose.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:56.950
And this one.

00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:59.560
This pose, then this one.

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:02.010
- Wow.
- Wow.

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:08.390
I’m a big star now—
a professional model.

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:13.770
Then I need your autograph now.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.330
You’ll be too busy later.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.970
Please sign for me.

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:21.770
Oh, me too!

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:26.110
Everyone wants one.
Give me one too.

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:27.850
This is prettier.

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:30.390
This one is clearer.
Could sell for a good price.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:33.160
Do you really want to live
with Grandpa and Grandma?

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:37.250
You don’t want to live with me?

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.010
You’ll have a baby sibling soon.

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:42.260
You can help me take care of it.

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:44.490
Not my sibling.

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:47.000
Of course it is. Why not?

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.960
Don’t pressure her.

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:54.950
You have a new family.

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:57.030
She’ll need to adjust there.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.120
And the baby coming too.

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.380
Let her stay with us.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.740
This home is her home too.

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:10.060
Right?

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:12.400
Do you want to go with me?

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:14.790
Let’s see which room you want.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.870
See what I prepared for you.

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:18.410
Wow.

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:20.190
Let’s go.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:32.540
Please look after her.
She refused to go with me at all.

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:34.800
Maybe she doesn’t like Steven much.

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:39.330
Don’t worry.
We’ll take good care of her.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:44.280
Send us updates from over there.

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:46.900
Think of this place
as your family too.

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:49.900
Okay. Thank you.

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:55.330
Excuse me, Nene.

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:59.060
Do you have a personal manager yet?

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:00.690
Uncle Than already booked me.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:03.610
- Oh.
- 50 off from me.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.100
50 baht.

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.320
- 50 baht?

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:11.660
If I don't manage well,
will I get fired?

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.340
Not sure.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.470
Now there's hope.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:18.420
Please consider it.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.040
Dad, are you stealing my job?

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:24.530
How’s the new gym branch going?

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:28.290
Not doing well yet.
Still low customers.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.100
Probably because
the economy isn’t great.

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:36.510
People are busy working,
not focusing on health.

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:40.010
Guess we need to rethink our plans.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:41.910
Slow and steady.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.560
Is his gym nice?

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:51.050
It’s nice. Lots of equipment,
even treadmills.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:52.520
Really?

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.220
I helped him with guests.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.340
- Wow, impressive.
- Eh?

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:01.060
Did you help or just cause chaos?

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.380
Chaos.

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:06.280
Nene.

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:09.430
Please eat some sausage,

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:11.940
and consider my proposal.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.400
You've got a gift for her.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.990
We missed our target this month.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.360
This location is the best, though.

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.030
What do you think it is?

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:36.620
- Hi.
- Hello.

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:38.410
Wow, I really need to work out.

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:40.400
Hello.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.210
The gym is so quiet.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.780
Quiet isn’t good.

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:47.940
If it stays like this,
we won’t see each other anymore.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.690
Oh, then that’s bad.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:58.470
Alright, if today you post
and tag the gym,

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:02.400
I’ll give extra points.
No post, no tag, no points.

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:04.880
Nut, make sure to check.

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.210
Anyone who doesn’t post
or tag will lose points.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:08.980
Yes.

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:11.830
Got it, let’s do it.

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:13.090
Take the picture now!

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:19.220
Now, start with me!

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:21.790
Post it!

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:25.830
Boom!

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:34.940
Lifting weights is heavy,
but lifting my heart is heavier.

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:38.480
Lift weights every day,
hoping to win your heart.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.140
Get used to the gym,
so I can eat without limits.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.290
Exercising because boss told me to.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.320
Done.

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:46.710
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:50.370
Posted.

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:54.000
Done too, but if the likes go up,

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:55.380
will there be any extra rewards?

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:56.210
Okay.

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:57.530
Awesome, thanks.

00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:00.190
I posted too—both photo and clip.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.180
- Great.
- Great.

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:04.860
Is Akin not coming today?

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:06.780
He took leave.

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:08.620
He said he's sick, can't get up.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.590
So he's working from home.

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:12.180
Oh, I see.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:13.740
Let's go.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.170
- Ready, bro.
- Let's go.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:15.830
- Go.
- Go.

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:16.980
Fai, this way.

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:17.910
Go, get to work.

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.700
Yes.

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:36.560
All done.
I turned off this section.

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:37.820
Please turn off the rest.

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:39.120
Wanna grab dinner?

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:43.320
So we can discuss the new plan
as Too suggested.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.960
- Can we do tomorrow?
- I’ve got stuff today.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.130
Stuff? Going to take care of Akin?

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.500
Matters of the heart come first.

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.240
So where does work rank then?

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:00.640
What do you mean?

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:05.280
I get it—love is important.

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:09.360
But stability in life is
just as important.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:13.520
Don't chase him so hard
you ruin your own life.

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:16.810
But sometimes what's inside...

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:20.100
It drives our life too,
don’t you think?

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:21.900
Or am I wrong?

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:29.210
Yeah.

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:31.200
Go on.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.780
I’ll handle things here.

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.310
I’m always rooting for you.

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:23.810
Are you alone?

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:26.930
Yeah.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.630
Easy to guess from that look.

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:33.100
Heartbroken, huh?

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:40.640
Welcome to single life,

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:42.560
but not lonely.

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:53.720
Do you think...

00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:59.340
Someone can disappear
from your life

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.740
without any reason at all?

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:07.940
Yeah.

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.940
We deserve to know why they left

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:16.220
if we are worthy enough.

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:22.340
Leaving without a word

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:26.980
hurts even more. Damn it.

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:31.060
Don’t overthink it.

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:35.530
He didn't love you, so he left.
Simple as that.

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.940
If he loved you,
he wouldn't leave. Right?

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:48.590
Nice to meet you.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:50.500
I’m Nut.

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:54.760
Than.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:57.320
My name is Than.

00:22:58.890 --> 00:22:59.930
I had a boyfriend.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.290
We haven’t broken up.

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:10.230
But I think I’m single now.

00:23:58.330 --> 00:23:59.030
What?

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:01.840
Porridge. I made it myself.

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:04.600
Mawin’s not here. Take it back.

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:08.260
I made it for you.
Too said you're sick.

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:11.720
Thanks, but it’s nothing serious.

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:15.200
Nothing serious, huh?

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:20.510
It's not nothing.

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:22.560
Have you taken meds yet?

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:25.230
I was about to
until someone bothered me.

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:33.960
Have you eaten anything?

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:35.720
Not really hungry.

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:38.450
You should go. I’m going to sleep.

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:54.290
What are you doing?

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:57.890
Checking your fever.

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:00.440
Like in Korean dramas.

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:02.690
You’re burning up.

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.920
Eat, take medicine,
then rest, okay?

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:38.440
I can eat by myself.

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:49.800
Your KPI will drop this month.

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:55.060
Skipped the gym
and even got sick leave.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:58.580
- Adjust my evaluation score.
- No.

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:00.530
I’m loyal to my duty.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.780
How’s my porridge? Good?

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.240
Honest answer or sugar-coated?

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.710
Come on.

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:10.880
I’ll give it 10 points.

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:12.990
Out of 100.

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:17.640
At least it’s not negative.

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:22.830
Don’t be dramatic.

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:24.480
I can eat myself.

00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:38.280
You’re really burning up.

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:40.060
Shouldn’t you see a doctor?

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:43.630
Food and meds should help.
I’ll be fine.

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:48.410
Done eating?

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:50.000
Have a bit more.

00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:51.230
I’m full.

00:26:57.250 --> 00:26:58.350
Then take your meds.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.640
How long have
these dishes been here?

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:25.740
Leave them. I’ll wash them later.

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.760
It’s fine. I’ll take care of them.

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:37.320
When Nene’s not here,
my room feels so quiet.

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:38.640
Is yours like that too?

00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:41.960
Do you cook or just buy food?

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:42.900
I think…

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:48.690
You fell asleep, sick boy.

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:05.780
Excuse me.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:39.800
Get well soon.

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:13.840
Leave it.
I’ll wash after this game.

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:15.650
Don’t leave it dirty.

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:19.290
Your soft hands might
get ruined by dish soap.

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:21.790
Then come help.

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:23.370
Wait, almost done.

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:33.410
Put worn clothes
in the white basket.

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:36.520
Laundry service will pick them up.
No need to wash.

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:39.050
They iron and return twice a week.

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:42.720
I don’t have many.
I reuse them first.

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:51.130
Warm milk helps you sleep better.

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:54.060
Who said I’m sleeping?

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:03.060
You washed all the dishes?

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:04.060
Yeah.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.260
I was about to help.

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:11.170
Do you have work tomorrow?

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:14.380
Meetings all afternoon.

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:16.910
So your morning’s free.

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:21.090
Meaning… you can get up late.

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:24.000
What?

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:27.940
A massage. Good?

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.020
Yeah… feels good.

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:34.840
Shall we move to the bed?

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:36.760
I can massage better there.

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:44.290
Do you even use what you bought?

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:50.220
Some things are just nice to have.

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:54.680
When you need them,
they’re right there.

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:58.450
Not for everyday use, but…

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:00.690
Important when needed.

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:05.310
No wonder this room has everything.

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:09.830
At least…

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:14.300
It makes me feel like
I lack nothing.

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:17.040
Unlike me.

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:21.130
I lack everything. I have nothing.

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:23.810
Really?

00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:31.710
Your back is stiff too.

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:33.450
Yeah.

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.220
How’d you learn to massage?

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.980
Nothing special.

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:43.750
Just a few small skills.

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:48.170
Alright, flip over.

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:33.350
What are you doing?

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:38.510
Is that too naive a question?

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:42.440
Just small set.
Big meetings tomorrow.

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.280
Meetings at 1 pm. Big set, please.

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:49.720
- Two
- One is enough

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:51.070
Otherwise, I won’t wake up.

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:54.780
So don’t poke me like before
in the morning.

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.210
Let morning handle itself then.

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:02.250
And now?

00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:28.330
Prasertsakulchai.

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:45.310
Enough. Morning class.

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:48.090
You have class, I don’t.

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:54.930
You shouldn't have turn 18.

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:56.980
Once you unlocked, no holding back.

00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:00.560
Before, you feared the law.

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:04.050
Now you must enjoy your rights.

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:08.670
Dating someone younger is tiring.

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:10.750
Tiring, but do you love me?

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:13.010
Yes.

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:16.690
If we can marry someday…

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:19.140
Will you take my surname

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:20.740
or I'll take yours.

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:22.640
Thinking too far.

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:26.210
Better to be prepared.

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:28.890
Thanwa Theerapanyakul.

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:30.660
Akin Phongdej.

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:33.020
Better you take my surname.

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:35.290
- Marry in or out?
- Not sure.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.610
So it counts as
living together first?

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.230
Even before ripe, huh?

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:43.300
Let me taste.

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:45.660
Ripe or not?

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:49.000
Than, no.

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.070
Going to shower for class.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.770
Come on.

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.050
What’s up so early?

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:32.240
Bro.

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:34.510
Check the pics I sent.

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:36.200
Sure.

00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:42.880
What’s that?

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:47.620
Why does Mavin have
a different surname?

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:49.490
I don't know.

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:55.650
Well, you work at that office.
Help investigate.

00:37:57.070 --> 00:37:59.710
Okay, that’s it.
Going back to bed.

00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:11.350
Who called so early?

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:14.090
Nothing. Go back to sleep.

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:19.960
Where are you going?

00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:21.900
Taking a shower.

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:24.570
Wait.

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:26.290
What?

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:34.400
- What?
- Poking.

00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:36.140
Why?

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:40.810
Add some energy to the morning.

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:48.520
Have a nice day.

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:51.710
That’s not enough.
One more, please.

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:54.470
- No.
- It won't long.

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:56.440
No.

00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:01.950
You like it rough, right?

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:03.650
No.

00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:07.650
Please.

00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:10.250
Hmm.

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:12.040
Not too long, okay?

00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:13.560
We must leave by 10.

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:15.250
How much time do we have?

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:18.200
15 minutes.

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:20.650
Perfect. Timer starts.

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:15.360
You didn't go back to your room?

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:19.740
I wanted to but
I fell asleep unknowingly.

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:21.640
Feeling better now?

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:23.690
Can you work today?

00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:31.760
Much better.

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:36.550
I’ve prepared breakfast.

00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:40.670
Go back to your room. No gym today?

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:42.140
I’ll go.

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:46.840
Thanks for staying up last night.

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:51.690
Consider it returning the favor
for watching over me.

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:54.690
We’re even now.

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:01.470
Still here? Go back already.

00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:05.110
You’re still using your
original surname, right?

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:07.520
Yes. What’s up?

00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:12.870
Then why doesn’t Mavin
use your surname?

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:17.210
That’s a family matter.

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:20.060
Ah, a secret.

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:24.310
I'm having a shower.
You can leave now.

00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:27.740
You always dodge my questions.

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:29.420
What’s the matter?

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:32.080
It’s none of your business.

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:36.350
Oh, or actually…

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:38.850
Mavin isn’t your son?

00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:42.730
- But he is…
- Why do you care?

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:47.450
So I don’t need to know anything?

00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:48.680
Is that it?

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:51.140
You…

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:52.830
Some pain

00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:55.950
doesn’t heal by digging it up.

00:41:58.310 --> 00:42:00.110
It heals only when we forget it.

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:02.810
Can you really do that?

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:05.690
I can’t.

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:09.980
I never forget anything about us.

00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:11.350
Believe me.

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:14.110
Let the past stay where it belongs.

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:17.380
Nothing gets better
by digging it up.

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:23.230
If something is broken,
I’m ready to fix it.

00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:27.290
If I made mistakes,
I want to make them right.

00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:29.890
Just tell me.

00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:33.540
Will you give me a chance?

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:38.830
Someone asking just for a chance

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:43.380
because they never valued
the chances given before.

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:46.650
Get out.

00:42:58.870 --> 00:43:00.480
What you're seeing

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:03.830
is a bag made from tie-dye
shibori from Phayao.

00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:08.180
Inspired by the sunlight reflecting
on Phayao’s river crane.

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:09.420
Very special.

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:13.040
It can also unfold into
a multipurpose cloth.

00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:15.230
- Show me. Wow.
- Here.

00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:16.680
It can be detached on both sides.

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:17.700
- Yes
- Wow, nice!

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:18.920
Is this one

00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:22.790
supported by the Department
of Business Development.

00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:26.800
Exactly, And it’s 100%
singular fashion.

00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:30.180
Using leftover fabric
to make valuable products

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:32.090
- Wow, nice.
- Very nice indeed

00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:33.910
- I love this kind of work
- Very chic

00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:36.170
Take it to Japan.
Contact buyers directly.

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:38.120
- Got it
- It sells well in Japan.

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.790
Definitely.

00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:39.840
We need to take photos too.

00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:42.420
- AJ, take photos for me.
- AJ.

00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:44.700
Hey, AJ.

00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:48.250
You know what we just talked about?
Where the fabric came from?

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:50.330
- Chiang Mai.
- No.

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:51.760
Where?

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:53.020
- Chiang Rai.
- No.

00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:16.950
Alright, one each, stress relief.

00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:19.590
Stressed about sales
not reaching target?

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:21.540
Or about Akin?

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:23.720
I don’t get it, man.

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:26.760
Sometimes things seem to improve.

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:29.100
Sometimes worse than before.

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:30.910
Which issue is this?

00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:34.020
Gym or your ex-boyfriend?

00:44:34.450 --> 00:44:35.600
Akin.

00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:38.200
I’m lost here.

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:42.910
Old issues unresolved,
new one unclear.

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:45.320
I want to apologize to him.

00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:47.170
I don’t even know what I did wrong.

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:50.110
I want to fix past mistakes

00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:52.960
but he never told me
what I messed up back then.

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:56.390
Hope and disappointment

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:58.670
keep switching back and forth
that I don’t know

00:44:58.690 --> 00:45:00.510
whether to move forward
or step back.

00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:04.690
Trying to love someone again

00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:07.210
without knowing what you did wrong

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:13.180
is like running after something
in a dark room.

00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:25.700
Love is never easy.

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:27.690
Especially loving
the same one again.

00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:30.350
It’s tough.

00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:52.680
I think the second
or third one is better.

00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:56.760
Don's car is coming.

00:45:58.210 --> 00:46:00.670
Why is it parked on the roadside?

00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:03.610
If he's here, get ready then.

00:46:03.830 --> 00:46:04.650
Yes, got it.

00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:30.470
The sauna theme.

00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:34.160
Than.

00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:38.820
The building management
sent a letter.

00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:48.530
They want to change from
collecting GP from our revenue

00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:50.780
to charging rent by actual space.

00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:52.790
Starting next month.

00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:57.920
They probably think
revenue share isn’t worth it.

00:46:58.750 --> 00:47:01.540
Can we afford rent by space?

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.960
Based on the brief,
the client wants to present…

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:10.990
It’s not too late, right?

00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:13.420
Sorry about that.

00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:16.720
The car I took dropped me midway

00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:20.300
so I had to walk,
very inconsiderate.

00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:23.060
He should have dropped me
a bit closer, my bad.

00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:25.880
Sorry. Alright, continue.

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:30.440
Based on the brief,
the client wants to show strength,

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:32.510
good health, and modernity.

00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:36.860
This model is a famous influencer
we found now.

00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:38.270
He’s also a bodybuilder.

00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:41.730
The second person is a foreigner.

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:44.690
We tried several types,
Thai and foreign.

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:48.690
The third is
a trending celebrity right now.

00:47:49.350 --> 00:47:51.630
He’s good, looks genuine.

00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:53.630
Not like just
photographing a model.

00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:55.440
He looks like
a normal attractive person.

00:47:56.350 --> 00:47:58.710
This one is okay.

00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:02.900
He's the most distinctive
among all of them.

00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:06.710
This one looks Thai enough.

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:09.120
And his eyes convey meaning well.

00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:12.450
This one has done skin shoot.

00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:17.350
Another, if you look closely,
one side of the face is bigger.

00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:19.750
He’s older in real life.

00:48:20.090 --> 00:48:22.830
His skin isn’t like this,
probably heavily edited.

00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:24.830
For on-ground activities,

00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:26.880
he might look too mature
for the product.

00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:28.530
Are you in a hurry?

00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:34.110
Why does this set seem
easier than the last kid’s shoot?

00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:35.760
Pond.

00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:44.090
Actually, the last look...

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:48.460
AJ, stand up.

00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:49.270
Me?

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.870
Thai, good build, unique.

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:06.080
It works. I’m fine with it.

00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:07.640
Oh, okay.

00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:10.480
Let Akin review the others.

00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:11.860
Then send them for my pick.

00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:15.160
I’ll discuss with the brand
and update soon.

00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:18.180
Sure, I’ll send this evening.

00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:19.160
Alright.

00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:23.210
Thanks for the info and feedback.

00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:24.420
Mr. Photographer.

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:27.150
My pleasure.

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:41.040
Ouch.

00:49:43.790 --> 00:49:46.670
Wow, so strong.

00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:48.940
Hidden muscles, AJ.

00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:53.760
From intern to model now.

00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:56.160
He’s shooting next week,
so he’s training hard.

00:49:58.910 --> 00:49:59.830
- Khamin
- Yes?

00:50:00.350 --> 00:50:01.790
Check on AJ, please.

00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:02.820
- Sure
- He might get hurt.

00:50:02.850 --> 00:50:04.530
Okay.

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:06.720
Alright, come here.

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:09.450
Khamin will take care of him,
don’t worry.

00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:11.880
How many sets for me?

00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:13.450
Another two sets, please.

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:16.040
- Two more? And done?
- Yes.

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:18.850
- Okay
- After sets, then dyeing.

00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:21.520
Oh gosh, dyeing my hair, right?

00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:22.140
Yes.

00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:29.390
Increase incline a bit
and add speed.

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:31.880
Hold here with both hands.

00:50:32.050 --> 00:50:33.920
You can track your heart rate too.

00:50:45.690 --> 00:50:48.240
Come on, I wouldn’t prank you.

00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:55.640
You need more cardio time.

00:50:56.570 --> 00:50:59.680
Your heart rate looks strange.

00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:04.130
With this rhythm,
no way your heart is steady.

00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:10.630
Great job.

00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:13.960
Next in the program,
shoulder workout.

00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:19.090
Hold it, hold it.

00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:27.160
I think if you build shoulders more,
it'll be great.

00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:28.840
Look at mine.

00:51:29.530 --> 00:51:33.340
It's still warm to lean on, right?

00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:39.440
Okay, two more, lift.

00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:45.900
Pond, check the logo for me.

00:51:46.650 --> 00:51:48.800
Nice. Holding with one hand works.

00:51:50.730 --> 00:51:51.650
Hold on, Pond.

00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:55.220
Add more here
so the muscle line shows clearly.

00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:56.300
Thank you.

00:51:57.510 --> 00:52:00.160
Wow, you work instantly.

00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:03.980
Won’t you help her apply the oil?

00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:10.250
Not skilled. I’m usually
the one getting oiled.

00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:15.760
Anything else to adjust?

00:52:15.790 --> 00:52:19.190
Be careful with
the product logo placement.

00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:20.110
Pond, watch the reflection.

00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:21.500
Okay, Pond?

00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:23.040
Okay.

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:24.820
Alex’s first set is done.

00:52:25.210 --> 00:52:26.740
Is the next model ready?

00:52:26.770 --> 00:52:28.230
If ready, come to the set.

00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:30.140
Yes, all set.

00:52:30.930 --> 00:52:33.160
- See you.
- Take care of him.

00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:36.240
Next is AJ.

00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:39.300
Oh, I can’t wait to see
how he looks.

00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:42.650
Here he comes.

00:52:42.670 --> 00:52:45.290
Wow.

00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:48.780
Hello, AJ.

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:51.860
Didn’t expect you’d look
this good fully styled.

00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:54.310
I’m a model today.

00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:55.870
Not an intern.

00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:56.790
Wow.

00:52:56.930 --> 00:52:58.780
Please take very good care of me.

00:53:00.330 --> 00:53:02.210
Get on set. Stop posing.

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:03.880
Make sure to do it well.

00:53:04.110 --> 00:53:06.360
May I interrupt?

00:53:06.590 --> 00:53:07.060
What?

00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:09.840
Fei, the other model,
still isn’t here.

00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:10.840
Then call him.

00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:12.160
I did. He didn’t answer.

00:53:12.190 --> 00:53:13.180
Call his manager.

00:53:13.210 --> 00:53:15.220
I did. No answer either.

00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:17.140
Fai. Give me the number.

00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:18.740
Okay, I sent it.

00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:24.850
Hello, hi.

00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:27.880
This is Too from Beyond Perfect.
Where are you?

00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:30.090
Yes, today.

00:53:30.110 --> 00:53:32.170
The team is already at the studio.

00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:34.050
No, today.

00:53:34.770 --> 00:53:36.140
Could you come now?

00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:38.640
What? Out of town?

00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:40.750
Can you make it back in time?

00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:42.960
Hello? Hello?

00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:48.820
- Fai
- Yes?

00:53:48.850 --> 00:53:51.610
His manager said she wrote down
the wrong date.

00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:53.750
She thought it was next week.
Who booked him?

00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:57.400
I did. But I’m sure it’s correct.
We have documents.

00:53:57.850 --> 00:53:59.590
But look at this.

00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:01.440
He posted this half an hour ago.

00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:04.800
I texted the organizer.
Fei was at event since the morning.

00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:06.290
Can he really do that?

00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:08.480
Ditching us to take another event?

00:54:09.610 --> 00:54:11.200
Fai, blacklist him.

00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:12.870
- I will.
- Don't call him anymore.

00:54:12.890 --> 00:54:14.070
Yes.

00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:15.890
So what do we do now?

00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:19.330
We sincerely apologize, Mr. Don.

00:54:19.810 --> 00:54:22.100
We’ve never dealt with this before.

00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:24.460
Me neither.

00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:34.070
So we’d bring you the best
alternatives for you

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:35.390
to consider.

00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:44.600
These are Than and Nat.

00:54:46.050 --> 00:54:47.480
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:49.110
Take your shirts off.

00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:51.960
Come on, quickly.

00:54:54.330 --> 00:54:54.850
Please.

00:55:02.170 --> 00:55:03.500
Thank you.

00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:06.440
These two are totally fresh.

00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:10.860
They’ve never represented
any products before, right?

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:13.840
I’ve reviewed this product before.

00:55:14.570 --> 00:55:16.620
And this one too.

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:18.120
Oh… I see.

00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:19.620
What about Than?

00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:22.530
- Never.
- There you go.

00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:24.570
What do you think?

00:55:31.070 --> 00:55:33.310
What will Nat and I be doing?

00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:35.560
Oh, very simple.

00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:38.580
You go in,
get makeup and hair done.

00:55:38.610 --> 00:55:43.480
Then on set, pose,
hold the product, just that.

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:47.420
Maybe apply some oil too,
little things like that.

00:55:48.370 --> 00:55:49.590
Easy, right?

00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:56.790
So I have to get makeup, hair,
and oil applied too?

00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:59.120
Yes, so you look manly.

00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:01.710
You’re always shirtless anyway.

00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:02.930
It’ll look manly.

00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:10.260
Okay, but I have one condition.

00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:13.670
If you agree, then I'll agree.

00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:24.190
AJ, last set.
Give me a handsome pose.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:25.460
Okay.

00:56:25.590 --> 00:56:27.830
I want some coffee.

00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:30.360
No caffeine, with milk.

00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:32.400
But not cow’s milk,
goat’s milk instead.

00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:34.170
AJ, stop being annoying.

00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:37.150
Pose properly
or you’ll fail your internship.

00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:42.080
- Akin.
- Yes?

00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:45.220
The model booked for today

00:56:45.250 --> 00:56:47.060
ditched us and took another job.

00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:50.070
I understand
it’s our responsibility.

00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:52.390
- But we must fix this now.
- Yes.

00:56:52.410 --> 00:56:55.680
I proposed a new model to Mr. Don,
and he agreed.

00:56:56.590 --> 00:56:58.610
If he agrees, then it’s no issue.

00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:02.060
But our model wants
to speak with you.

00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:03.710
He wants the brief, right?

00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:05.200
Sure, no problem.

00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:07.570
I’m not sure, something like that.

00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:09.220
Talk to him for me.

00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:10.060
Sure.

00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:11.420
- Thanks.
- Yes.

00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:26.890
- Hello, Fai.
- Hello.

00:57:27.250 --> 00:57:28.860
Hello, Akin.

00:57:29.930 --> 00:57:33.100
Fai will brief you on what
you’ll need to do.

00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:36.420
But Too said you would
be the one briefing me.

00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:39.860
And I haven’t agreed yet
to do the shoot.

00:57:41.570 --> 00:57:42.850
- Fai.
- Yes?

00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:45.240
May I speak with Akin privately

00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:46.470
about the shoot?

00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:51.710
Sure. I’ll go check the set.

00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:52.980
Thank you.

00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:05.090
So are you shooting or not?
Stop dragging it out.

00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:08.000
I told Too I want to help.

00:58:08.420 --> 00:58:10.480
I’ve never done
anything like this before.

00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:12.180
I’m completely new.

00:58:13.030 --> 00:58:14.730
So you’re taking my first time.

00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:18.830
And I have to go shirtless, too.

00:58:19.170 --> 00:58:21.990
Plus people will be applying
oil on my body.

00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:26.170
I’m not comfortable with
random hands touching me.

00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:28.060
But it’s the client’s product.

00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:30.400
- Or I will ask...
- I understand.

00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:32.460
I didn’t say I won’t do it.

00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:34.310
But the person applying oil on me

00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:36.090
must be you.

00:58:36.930 --> 00:58:41.880
I don’t feel safe when
other people touch me.

00:58:42.170 --> 00:58:45.220
I’m a bit protective of myself.

00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:46.800
You should understand.

00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:49.630
Fine. Go get ready.

00:58:50.090 --> 00:58:51.020
One more thing.

00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:56.840
You must have dinner with me
for one week.

00:58:57.310 --> 00:59:00.750
In exchange for helping
your shoot go smoothly.

00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:05.440
If you don’t want to, it’s fine.

00:59:05.470 --> 00:59:08.170
You can find
another pro model.

00:59:08.190 --> 00:59:09.100
- If you can…
- Okay, okay.

00:59:09.830 --> 00:59:10.550
That’s all?

00:59:11.090 --> 00:59:11.920
One more thing.

00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:12.770
What now?

00:59:13.210 --> 00:59:14.950
A deposit first,
in case you bail on me.

00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:22.460
Go gentle, okay?

00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:24.660
My skin is sensitive.

00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:27.720
I'm protective of you.

00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:29.630
Me too.

00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:30.740
Can you tell me?

00:59:31.550 --> 00:59:32.680
What did I do wrong?

00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:34.360
Do you feel anything?

00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:38.380
If you feel uncomfortable,
just say it.

00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:39.720
I’m ready to move out.

00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:42.550
Do you hear me?
You can knock back.
