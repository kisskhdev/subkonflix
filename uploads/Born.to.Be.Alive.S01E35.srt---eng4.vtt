Leave it there.

Be quick.

We need to talk to you.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:58.570
Hello.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.410
Officer Bai asked me to come.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.940
This way.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.190
You're here.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:05.830
You've been drinking.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.020
You know why

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.020
I called you here?

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.850
Come with me.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:22.950

find that man.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.840
I just want to ask him

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.750
why he lied to me.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.500
Why? Why?

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.720
For the money in your account.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.780
I don't believe it.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.780
There are

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.430
so many of us in our dance team.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.960
Why did he

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.810
specifically add me on WeChat?

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:06.240
He said

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.920
he fell for me at first sight.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.000
If I were a scammer,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.730
I'd pick you at first sight too.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.480
Out of all those old ladies,

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.390
I bet you were wearing

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:14.100
the most jewelry,

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.160
weren't you?

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.070
Did that make you

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.270
dance half a beat slower
than everyone else?

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.050
He's actually got a bit of conscience.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.820
He left

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:21.890

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:22.920
off your neck.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:23.340
Hey...

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.670
That's enough.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.280
Alright, Mom.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.300
Cheer up, okay?

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.050
I'll make up

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.510

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.810
I want the man.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.900
I just want to ask him to his face,

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.750
during the time

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:41.830
we spent together,

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.830
was every word he said to me

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:45.740
a lie?

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.840
You...

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.810
Why won't you wake up?

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:51.650
This isn't love.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.690
It's a scam!

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:53.659
Impossible!

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.830
What's wrong with me falling in love?

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.409
Fine. Let's go home now.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.380
We'll just consider it

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.430
money spent on a lesson.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.980
Let's go.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.860
Let's go home. Come on.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:02.570

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:03.330

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.330
That's enough.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.270
You've been scolding her
since you came in.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.000
Why don't you look at yourself?

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.980
Many elderly people have been
scammed recently.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:12.810
You think it's because

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:13.470
they're too trusting

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.200
and out of touch with the times.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:15.830
But have you ever wondered

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.030
why they get scammed?

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.640
These elderly people

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.840
share a common trait.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:22.560
Either they live alone

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.240
and their children are in other cities,

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.390
or their children are busy with work

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.970
all day

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.450
and don't have time for them.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.930
You can't just

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.590
blame your mom for what happened.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.320
You're responsible for it too.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:35.670
Come on, Ms. Wang,

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:36.620
calm down.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.350
Let's go home, okay?

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:38.980
Okay.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.560
Okay?

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:41.240
Careful.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:56.860
Watch your step.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:06:59.850
Don't worry, Ms. Wang,

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:00.720
we will

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:01.750
keep you updated.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.340
Mom, you go up first.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.380
I'll have a few more words
with Officer Bai.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:06.790
Okay.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.680
Bai, thank you.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.720
Now that we're friends on WeChat,

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.270
feel free to chat with me anytime.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:15.220
Sure thing.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:15.570
Okay.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:16.580
Go on up, Ms. Wang.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.660
I'll go up now.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.120
Give me the bag.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:19.530
Okay.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.570
Watch your step.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:30.800
Thank you.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:32.750
Even driving us back.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.390
No problem.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:35.360
They called me over

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.730
because I'm familiar

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.310
with

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.040
the suspect's background.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.900
This guy is a repeat offender.

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:42.600
Having you handle

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.950
these trivial cases

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.960
is a waste of your talent.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:48.490
How can you call them trivial?

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:50.800
All cases

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:51.950
are major cases.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.430
For another family,

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:55.010
this could be

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:57.010
a catastrophe that bankrupts them.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.240
Just like Wu Jiang's death.

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:04.770
It might look like a simple

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:05.830
traffic accident.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:07.230
But for me,

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.450
it's not over yet.

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.780
Letting a case like this affect your work—

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.320
is it worth it?

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.360
It's not about whether
it's worth it or not.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.490
Once you've seen it,

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.490
you can't pretend you haven't.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:26.110
That's the police.

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:34.750
Alright,

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:36.120
you should go up now.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.059
I should go too.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:01.340
I asked you to post

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.070
on Moments to make us official.

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:04.770
Look at this.

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:05.910
What does this post

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:06.910
have to do with me?

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:15.460
Look.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.290
Fine.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.500
I'll forgive you this time.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.480
I'll post one too.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:31.240
I'm going to post it openly.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:32.190
Let me tell you,

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.030
I've never shown off
my relationship before.

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:36.550
When I dated as a kid,

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:37.810
it was like being a spy.

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:39.270
I had to hide it from my mom.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.470
Back then,

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:41.360
Auntie Zhang opposed it

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.160
because she didn't want it to
affect your studies.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.770
Now you don't have to hide it,

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:47.170
but she still opposes it.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:49.600
She's afraid it'll affect your future.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.060
Who said my mom opposes it?

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:53.150
Waiter.

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:54.670
Two Cokes, please.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:55.000
Thanks.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:55.330
Sure.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:56.650
Cold one for me.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:57.410
Okay.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:58.510
Thanks.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.180
I'm not stupid.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:04.840
I can tell.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.210
Don't worry.

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:09.680
I won't make things difficult for you.

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:11.530
Here.

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:12.250
Thanks.

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:12.790
Thanks.

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:18.800
What do you mean by that?

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:22.230
Are you getting cold feet?

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.650
If you don't back out, I won't either.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:28.990
Here.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:40.700
Eat up.

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:41.210
Let's

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.450
go see a movie after we finish.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:43.090
But

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:44.670
I don't watch action movies.

you liked that kind of stuff.

I was going to ask you.

Xinhai reported that they found

he just caused a scene at Xinhai.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:56.580
Xinhai suspects him

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.460
of plotting a security incident.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:11:59.590
That's impossible.

what he can

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.580
and cannot do.

I don't think

Han would do something like that either.

Since we were kids,

you use this tone when you're angry.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.280
It gives me the creeps.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.940
You used Han to investigate those things.

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:41.280
Now he's locked up.

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:43.570
And you're on leave

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.800
because of this case.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.220
You need to weigh the consequences

It's not that.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:08.280
I just don't get it.

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:11.320
What do you see in Han?

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:19.640
You need a reason

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:20.600
to hate someone.

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:23.520
You also need a reason to love someone.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.260
But you don't need that to like someone.

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:30.850
I don't quite understand.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:32.870
So at the moment,

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.700
you like Han,

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:37.070
and this is the first stage.

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:38.600
So the second stage is love?

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:40.820
Can you really divide it like that?

I'm going to bully him.

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:03.820
If I go back to Guangzhou,

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:05.680
I'll definitely take him with me.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.500
and introduce him to my girlfriends.

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:12.770
this introversion of his.

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.460

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:08.329
where I will

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:09.500
report on our work.

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:10.440
After the meeting,

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.630
we can go inspect

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:12.920
the first enterprise.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:13.880
The first enterprise

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.030
is on the west side of the city.

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:16.030
It's not far.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:16.790
Okay.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:17.640
Please.

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:18.670
This way please.

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:20.010
Was the journey smooth?

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:20.670
Yes, it was.

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:22.210
Thank you for coming.

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:34.640
Tianduo

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.140
has developed

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:37.990
and changed a lot in recent years.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.430
Look at these highways,

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:41.480
they extend in all directions.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.200
This is thanks to

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.700
the support from the province.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.140
Thanks to the special road subsidy

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:45.680
provided by

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.810
Department of Transportation.

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:47.380
Yes.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.730
Without it, we wouldn't

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:49.970
have been able to build

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:51.500
such high-grade highways.

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.710
Director,

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.230
it's the Municipal Government

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:04.940
Emergency Duty Office.

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:06.490
Please excuse me, I need to take this.

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:07.490
Go ahead, take it.

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:10.150
Hello, go ahead.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:12.530
What?

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:15.200
Are there any casualties?

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.680
Okay, I see.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:19.270
What happened?

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:21.800
Mingjia Chemical Factory

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.380
has had a chemical gas leak.

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:26.410
Report it to Mr. Director.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:29.520
Director,

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:32.960
it was the Municipal Government
Emergency Office.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.270
They said Mingjia Chemical Factory

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:35.180
in the east of the city

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.710
has had a chemical gas leak.

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.760
I'll go over there

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:38.980
and check.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.210
Are there any casualties?

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:41.290
We don't know yet.

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:44.480
This is no small matter.

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:46.410
How about this?

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:47.530
Let's all

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:48.400
go there

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:49.680
and check together.

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:52.820
Let's go there now.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.520
To Mingjia Chemical Factory.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.370
Yes, Mayor.

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:56.030
Sir,

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:57.610
to Mingjia Chemical Factory.

00:18:57.610 --> 00:18:58.190
Okay.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:15.590
The Mayor is here.

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:16.520
Hurry!

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:21.150
Hurry.

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:25.420
Mayor Lin.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.900
What's the situation?

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:27.630
This morning,

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:28.790
the Emergency Office

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:30.290
received reports from nearby residents

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:31.200
saying that they smelled

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:31.880
an unpleasant odor

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:32.920
in their homes.

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:34.400
It smelled like rotten eggs,

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.560
and a bit like gas.

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:36.740
They thought

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:37.500
it was their own

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.560
gas tanks leaking.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:39.870
After inspection,

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:41.470
we pinpointed the location.

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:43.000
It was this chemical factory

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
that had the leak.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.840
Have you found the leak point?

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:47.610
This is Director Huo, who just arrived

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:49.070
in our city today for an inspection.

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:50.050
Hello, Director.

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:51.140
Tell us the specifics.

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:51.400
Okay.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.390
Let's talk as we walk.

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:52.990
Director,

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:54.650
it appears to be

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:55.680
the evaporator in Workshop 4

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.780
of our factory.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:57.920
We have activated

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:58.920
the emergency protocol

00:19:58.920 --> 00:19:59.950
and welded

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:01.110
the leaking gasket.

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:01.820
By now,

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:02.770
the leak has been brought

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:04.240
under preliminary control.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:04.700
Just now,

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:05.290
I heard from

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:06.770
colleagues at the Meteorological Bureau

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:07.810
that for the next couple of days,

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:09.610
we'll have winds of force five or six.

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:10.570
So the fumes should

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:11.900
disperse very quickly.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.530
Your response was fairly prompt.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.350
"Safe production"—

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:18.210
safety comes before production.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.610
Rather than solving problems,

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:21.790
the most fundamental thing

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:23.240
is to take preventive measures.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.610
You must address the root cause

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:26.220
to avoid these issues.

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:27.490
Director Huo,

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:29.110
I am very sorry.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.180
I'd like to offer

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:31.310
my apologies to you.

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:33.120
You just arrived today,

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:34.700
and this happened.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.180
Our work

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:37.400
has not been solid

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:38.460
and thorough enough.

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.520
No need to rush into self-criticism.

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:42.420
The top priority is to quickly

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.500
and properly handle the aftermath.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.500
Immediately shut down relevant workshops

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.810
and conduct a thorough inspection.

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:48.310
Yes.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:49.630
Do exactly as Director instructed.

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:49.940
Go, now!

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:50.480
Yes, sir.

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:01.370
Truck 3! Truck 3!

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.140
Stop loading.

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:03.000
Hurry up and go!

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:05.100
Move it!

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.290
Mr. Meng. Mr. Meng.

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:08.980
Copy that. Go ahead.

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:11.090
We can't move the crushers out in time.

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:12.530
We can't move the crushers out in time.

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:13.530
What should we do?

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:17.660
Bai Chun.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:20.710
Bai Chun. Are you there?

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:21.870
Bai Chun, come here.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.200
Do we have any aged seals left?

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:26.680
Yes.

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:27.910
They're inside.

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:29.890
I'll have someone bring them to you.

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:31.890
Seal them all. Don't miss anything.

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:35.350
Is there any loess left?

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:36.680
Is there any loess left?

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:01.800
It's green. Why aren't we moving?

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.260
Is there a traffic jam?

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:06.610
This road

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:08.850
isn't usually congested.

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:10.110
What's going on today?

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:15.380
Hello, what's going on?

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.540
Hurry up

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:19.970
and move the truck, okay?

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:20.980
Hurry up. Be quick.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:22.270
The leadership has urgent matters
to attend to.

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:23.200
What's going on?

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.220
Mayor, here is the situation.

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.420
A box truck up ahead

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.170
flipped over

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.270
and blocked the road.

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:29.180
Was anyone hurt?

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:30.270
No one was hurt,

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:30.740
but

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:31.350
the driver

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:32.290
is trapped inside the truck.

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:32.960
Traffic police and fire and rescue

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.440
are on their way.

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:35.370
But we won't be able to

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:36.960
get through for a while.

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:39.880
Sir,

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:41.370
I'm sorry

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.800
about this accident.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:44.310
It's fine.

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:46.370
We have the patience to wait.

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:51.400
Everyone,

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.200
the altitude

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.920
at the mining area is indeed a bit high.

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:56.530
The bus is

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.810
supplying oxygen for us.

00:22:57.810 --> 00:22:59.050
After we get off,

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:00.010
if anyone

00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:00.830
feels unwell,

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:02.240
please let us know

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.040
immediately.

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:04.050
Okay.

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:05.890
We've overcome

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:08.360
many difficulties on this trip.

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:11.650
But in any case,

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:13.920
we must

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:16.360
see Xinhai today.

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:53.770
Liu! Liu!

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:56.010
Stop!

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.000
What's wrong, Mr. Meng?

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.050
This area is fine now.

00:23:58.050 --> 00:23:58.550
Go over there.

00:23:58.550 --> 00:23:58.960
See that?

00:23:58.960 --> 00:23:59.830
Where the coal seam is exposed.

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:00.290
Pack up.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.340
Load the truck.

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:02.220
Go over there.

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:05.680
Someone got run over! Back up!

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:06.760
Hua, hang in there.

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:08.570
Hua, hang in there.

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:09.070
What happened?

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:09.530
What happened?

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:09.920
Old Hua.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:10.520
A reversing truck.

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:11.380
He got run over.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:14.240
Get a car down here

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:14.950
and get him to the hospital, now!

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:15.340
Hurry!

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:16.160
Get a pickup truck!

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.110
Get a pickup truck, quick!

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:17.960
Make way.

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:19.180
Move aside.

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:21.220
Clear out if you're not helping.

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:21.860
Don't crowd around.

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:22.790
Get back to work!

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:27.970
Hold off on calling an ambulance.

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:30.380
Take him to the dorms.

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:31.240
The mine clinic

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:32.610
can't handle this.

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:34.640
The inspection team is almost here.

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.000
We can't go to the hospital now.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:36.530
Mr. Meng—

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:37.400
I'll take full responsibility.

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.030
It's a matter of life and death.

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:38.660
None of us

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.480
can bear the consequences
of delaying treatment.

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:44.510
Bro,

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.610
it's a special situation today.

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:48.830
I promise you,

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:49.760
the company will

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.490
give you double compensation.

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:56.810
Take him to the dorms.

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:57.540
Get the medic

00:24:57.570 --> 00:24:58.480
to stop the bleeding first.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:58.810
Okay.

00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:59.270
No.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.900
He must go to the hospital.

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:01.630
Manager Bai,

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:02.770
at a time like this,

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:04.630
please consider the big picture.

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:09.490
Whose big picture?

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:24.430
Mr. Meng.

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:26.090
The pilot car is leading
the inspection team

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:26.600
up here.

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.250
Copy that.

00:25:58.740 --> 00:25:59.350
Sir.

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:00.220
Welcome.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:01.090
Watch your step.

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:01.540
This is

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:03.200
the head of the provincial
environmental inspection team.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:03.900
Deputy Director of Department

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:05.350
of Environmental Protection,
Mr. Huo Xiaoyue.

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:06.400
Meng Yaohui of Xinhai Group.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:06.900
Hello.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:07.920
Welcome, everyone,

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.580
to Xinhai for the inspection.

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:11.890
We look forward to your feedback.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:12.850
Okay.

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:14.520
Let's begin.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:16.240
This way, please.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:16.840
After you.

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.170
What's the situation here?

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:24.980
After the mining ban was issued,

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:26.700
we ensured strict compliance.

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:27.290
This is a batch of

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:28.700
vehicles that have been
taken out of service.

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.500
We haven't disposed of them yet.

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:33.030
Is the officer in the back okay?

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:33.760
Take it slow.

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:35.090
Song,

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:35.440
come on,

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:35.920
the oxygen tank!

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:36.750
On it!

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:39.160
I'm sorry.

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:40.540
Xinhai Coal Mine

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:41.920
is located at a high altitude.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.180
Since you just came up,

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:44.610
you might feel a bit unwell.

00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:46.140
No rush. Let's walk slowly.

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:47.070
Right.

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:47.350
It's okay.

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:48.070
Take it slow.

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:49.130
Let's look around.

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:52.260
Over here,

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:53.660
the main area of Mine No. 2

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:54.740
has been shut down.

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:57.010
You can see

00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:58.540
that white area over there.

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:00.350
That area stopped operations long ago.

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:02.610
Currently, only this small

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:03.410
corner area

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.940
is undergoing work of
clearing out stockpiles

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:06.670
and disposing of outcrop coal.

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:08.720
Since we have this inspection today,

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:09.630
for safety reasons,

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:11.070
we stopped work early.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.320
What do you mean by

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.770
"disposing of outcrop coal"?

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:16.460
Based on expert studies

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:18.050
and to avoid wasting resources,

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:19.240
following the principle of

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:20.040
environmental conservation,

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.500
we mined less than

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:23.180
50,000 tons of outcrop coal.

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.160
It is worth noting that

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:26.580
all revenue from

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:27.610
this outcrop coal

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:29.400
is going to slope regreening.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.770
It helps cover

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:33.920
the funding gap for slope management.

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:35.850
Your approach

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.240
is quite flexible.

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:38.770
Indeed,

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:40.720
we should allow some flexibility.

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:43.150
The regreening work at this mine

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:44.550
is on the right track.

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:45.740
It is proceeding in a solid

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:46.870
and orderly manner.

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:48.510
The most obvious sign

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:49.610
is that

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.680
the air quality index

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:52.790
has significantly improved.

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:53.720
The air quality

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.220
is much better now.

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:56.660
Environmental work

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:57.860
benefits the present

00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:58.880
and the future.

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:00.550
For the mining area's

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.010
ecological restoration project,

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:03.070
we have also made

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:04.230
long-term plans.

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:06.500
The measures and plans

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.420
adopted by your city

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:09.570
are quite pragmatic

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:10.530
and effective.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.810
This aligns with the requirements
from above

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:14.680
and the city's actual situation.

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:17.290
This mine is indeed

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:18.700
at a high altitude.

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:20.420
I see that some of you

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:21.770
are not quite used to it.

00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:22.630
How about this?

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:24.070
Let's go to their canteen

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:25.010
for a work lunch.

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:27.160
Then we'll go to Mine No. 1

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:28.730
to check the regreening there.

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:29.530
Just a moment.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.070
Our inspection team

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:32.030
received a signed

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:33.770
letter of complaint from the public,

00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:35.050
claiming they have found

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:36.050
that Xinhai Coal Mine

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:37.710
is engaged in illegal mining.

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:46.860
Sir,

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:48.560
during the recent

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.810
rectification of small and medium-sized

00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:51.070
coal mines in the city,

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:52.850
someone came to Xinhai

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.250
to disrupt production order

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:55.050
and cause trouble.

00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:56.450
They were investigated.

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:58.320
As for illegal mining...

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:01.440
That is purely their imagination.

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:02.510
As far as I know,

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:04.160
in the city,

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:05.760
there are indeed enthusiastic

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:06.960
environmentalists.

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:08.580
They feel

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:10.030
the development of the coal industry

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:11.160
leads to pollution,

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:12.510
so

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:14.290
in their call for
environmental protection,

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:15.550
their course of action

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.240
can be a bit radical at times.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.290
These are the materials

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:27.880
and photos submitted by the whistleblower.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:43.950
Manager Meng,

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:44.810
take a look.

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.360
Is this Xinhai?

00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:59.310
These...

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:01.550
do look a bit like us.

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:04.080
You said earlier that

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:04.900
Xinhai Coal Mine

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:06.830
mined 50,000 tons of outcrop coal.

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:07.750
Yes.

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:09.180
Looking at

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:10.610
the data on the registry,

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.500
and based on a coal truck's

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:14.460
carrying capacity of 50

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:15.500
to 100 tons,

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.370
a rough estimate would suggest

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:18.260
it is likely far more than

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:19.160
50,000 tons.

00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:23.130
And the nighttime traffic volume

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:25.210
is two to three times that of the day.

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:26.520
So

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:28.230
how do you explain that?

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:32.670
Is the data here

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:33.510
accurate?

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:36.020
Judging by the data

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:37.570
on the registry,

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.170
the coal transport volume does

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:41.640
come into question.

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:43.390
But the authenticity

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.350
of this registry

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:47.470
needs further verification.

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:50.720
Vice Mayor Lin.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:51.930
Director Ma.

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:54.420
Hurry up and

00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:55.820
set up a dedicated team.

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:57.750
Investigate thoroughly.

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:58.220
Yes.

00:30:58.820 --> 00:30:59.550
Confirm the mining

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:00.790
and sales data,

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:03.430
and report to the inspection team
as soon as possible.

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.900
Okay.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:12.660
Coming.

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:15.080
Shao Yunfei!

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:20.110
What's wrong?

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:21.450
Was it you who gave the photos

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:22.050
taken by Han

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:23.380
to the inspection team?

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:26.590
Yes, right.

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:28.330
Han

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:29.510
had a bad feeling when he

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:30.810
received the call from the mine.

00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:32.510
He told me to act at my discretion

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:33.310
and submit the materials

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:34.160
in his name.

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:35.690
So you just did?

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:37.580
Well, I should have

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:38.720
discussed it with you beforehand.

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:39.260
But...

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.610
this inspection

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:41.610
was too sudden,

00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:42.770
so I didn't have time to tell you.

00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:43.640
Shao Yunfei,

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:45.110
you've been

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.850
an investigative journalist

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:46.830
for so many years.

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:47.820
How come you just

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:49.160
don't get it?

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:50.770
Han did capture

00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:51.450
something.

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:52.810
But it definitely doesn't form

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:54.100
a complete chain of evidence.

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:55.040
Doing this now

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:55.980
will only alert them

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.780
and make them even more guarded.

00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:59.190
It will make gathering evidence

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:00.350
even harder later on.

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:01.480
Do you understand?

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:03.960
"A complete chain of evidence"?

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:04.660
Right.

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:07.160
We've been investigating Xinhai

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:07.860
for so long.

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:09.270
And the result?

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:11.880
Han has been detained.

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:13.020
You've been kicked out of the task force

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:14.420
and forced to take leave.

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:15.310
And me?

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.130
I can only write

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:17.080
what they want me

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:17.750
to write.

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:18.850
Other than that,

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:20.400
anything involving Xinhai

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:21.420
gets blocked.

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:23.480
That they dare to do this—

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.690
who knows how much protection they've got

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:26.780
behind them?

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:28.460
We finally have

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.220
the provincial environmental
inspection team here.

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:31.620
Are we going to let them
get away with it again?

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:32.150
What do you think

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:32.960
those photos from Han

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:33.740
can prove?

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:35.200
I'm asking you—what can they prove?

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.400
Keep your voice down.

00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:38.000
Xinhai can just make up an excuse

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.240
and get away with it.

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:55.490
Maybe.

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:57.880
Maybe in the eyes

00:32:57.910 --> 00:32:58.710
of those people at Xinhai,

00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:59.350
we're just a few

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:00.880
flies they can't get rid of.

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:02.770
Maybe this complaint

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.570
will end up being a waste of time,

00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:07.030
just a splash in the water.

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:08.480
But does that mean

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:09.070
we should just

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:09.940
do nothing?

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:11.720
I'm not telling you

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:12.670
to do nothing.

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.090
I just want you

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:15.250
to be less reckless

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:15.980
and think about Zhuling

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:17.180
before you act.

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:18.020
Am I reckless?

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:21.630
When I first

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:23.120
left the Mountain Patrol,

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:24.500
Captain had me hand in

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:25.370
his reserve work notes

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:26.420
to the provincial authorities.

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:27.590
Because he knew

00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:29.240
we'd only get one chance.

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:31.360
Giving it one try

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:33.510
is better than watching

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:34.500
irreversible damage

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:35.200
happen,

00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:36.600
and then regretting it.

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:41.190
Promoting the Mountain Patrol back then,

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:43.920
writing articles to protect
Tibetan antelopes,

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:45.690
and exposing Xinhai's illegal mining now—

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:47.030
it's all the same to me.

00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:49.880
It's all for protecting the environment.

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:52.720
It is something I must do

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:53.870
at all costs.

00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:55.810
You say that when I do things,

00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:57.290
I don't think about Zhuling.

00:33:57.290 --> 00:33:59.220
Since she was born,

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.020
everything I do,

00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:01.850
every single moment,

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:02.980
I'm thinking of her.

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:04.420
I'm doing this

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:05.630
so when she grows up,

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:06.430
I can tell her,

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:07.660
regardless of ability

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:08.540
or outcome,

her father,

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:10.980
when it was time to stand up,

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:11.949
did not retreat.

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:13.280
I did what an ordinary person

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.420
should do.

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:22.860
I know...

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.239
you've always wanted to be

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:27.170
a good reporter.

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:30.050
In Bolamula,

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:32.960
that time we almost froze to death,

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:36.360
I asked you,

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.130
if you regretted entering the mountains.

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:41.300
But you said

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:44.820
you regretted

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:47.080
not joining the Mountain Patrol sooner.

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:50.340
Don't make fun of me.

00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:53.550
I'm not making fun of you.

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.720
Bolamula is the highest place

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:04.280
I have ever been.

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:07.950
Not just in altitude.

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.420
Once you reach the peak,

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:11.340
the only thing you can do

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:12.340
is go down.

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:14.210
Back then, I said

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:16.670
I stayed in the provincial
capital for work.

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:18.180
I separated from you and Zhuling.

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:19.120
But in these past few years,

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.380
I've achieved nothing

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:22.460
and ended up here again.

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:24.530
Like you said,

if you don't finish the road,

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.970
you can't reach your destination.

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:36.500
I didn't say that.

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:36.870
are powerful and effective.

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:38.980
The ban on coal mining

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:40.510
and ecological restoration work

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:42.040
are progressing smoothly.

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:43.170
Slope management

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:44.610
and mine regreening work

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:45.830
have had a good start.

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:48.250
However, there are two matters

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:50.390
I need to bring to everyone's attention.

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:51.190
First,

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.900
regarding Mingjia Chemical Factory's

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:55.710
chemical gas leak incident,

00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:57.020
we issue a criticism.

00:38:57.570 --> 00:38:59.070
The municipal government must

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:00.590
investigate liability as soon as possible

00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:02.800
handle it according to
laws and regulations,

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:03.850
and submit a written report

00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:05.150
to the provincial government

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:06.550
and include the results.

00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:08.340
Second,

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:09.690
regarding the outcrop coal issue

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:10.920
at Xinhai Coal Mine,

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:12.980
the information we gathered

00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:14.440
through public surveys

00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:15.710
does not align with

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:17.520
what the municipal government reported

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:18.190
to us.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:20.980
Whether

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.540
there are deeper issues,

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:24.800
we cannot conclude at present.

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:27.050
Although the inspection

00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:28.150
has ended,

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:31.580
the inspection team will
continue to follow up

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:33.660
and get to the bottom of this matter.

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:39.000
We thank the inspection team

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.300
for checking on our city's

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.050
environmental protection work.

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:42.760
Regarding the issues

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.010
raised by the inspection team,

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:45.090
we accept them all.

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:48.110
We will promptly rectify them accordingly.

00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:56.320
Come in.

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:00.220
Chief, you were looking for me?

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:01.600
Good, very quick.

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:02.000
Come on,

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.200
let me introduce you.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:04.440
Sir,

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:06.260
this is Bai Ju,

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:07.510
whom I just mentioned.

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:08.120
This is

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:09.440
Mr. Huo, head of the
provincial environmental

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:10.230
inspection team.

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:10.890
Hello, sir.

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:11.880
Hello.

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:12.760
This is—

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:13.290
[Mu Zhonghe, Discipline Inspection
Commission of Qinghai Province]

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:15.140
Mu Zhonghe of the Provincial
Discipline Inspection Commission.

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:15.700
Hello, sir.

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:16.190
Hello.

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:18.360
Bai Ju,

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:19.490
grab a chair.

00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:20.270
Let's sit and talk.

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:20.670
Okay.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:28.970
Officer Bai,

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:30.470
our

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:31.940
environmental inspection of Tianduo City

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:33.030
is coming to an end.

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:34.970
There are some matters

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:36.180
our colleague from the
Discipline Inspection Commission

00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:37.910
would like to discuss with you.

00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:40.480
Officer Bai,

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:42.130
based on the complaint

00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:42.980
we received

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:44.110
and this

00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:45.670
inspection in Tianduo,

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:46.970
we suspect that

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.800
there are major issues

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.680
behind Xinhai Coal Mine.

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:52.570
Since we currently

00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:54.090
lack solid evidence,

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:55.320
we have requested

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:56.650
support and assistance

00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:58.380
from the Municipal Public Security Bureau

00:40:58.380 --> 00:40:58.800
to secretly

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.460
investigate Xinhai's issues

00:41:00.590 --> 00:41:01.690
after we leave

00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:03.320
Tianduo City.

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:07.440
We have reported this matter

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.390
to the provincial leadership

00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:09.250
in charge

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:10.210
and the Provincial

00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:11.360
Public Security Department.

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:12.530
They all agreed.

00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:15.680
You are more familiar with the situation

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:16.390
at Xinhai.

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:17.720
You are the best fit

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:18.720
for this mission.

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:20.190
This investigation

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:21.590
isn't just about Xinhai,

00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:24.020
but also the umbrella behind it.

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:25.820
The provincial leadership
has instructed that

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:26.800
there shall be

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:28.430
no exceptions to Party discipline

00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:29.290
and state laws.

00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:30.540
No matter who is involved,

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:32.140
whatever their background,

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:33.550
we must get to the bottom of it.

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:34.280
Understood.

00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:36.250
I appreciate your trust.

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:38.340
I promise to complete the task.

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:41.180
We must not alert them before

00:41:41.410 --> 00:41:42.900
having obtained evidence.

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:43.870
The smaller the target

00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:44.800
and the fewer the people,

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.730
the better for the investigation.

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:47.330
Of course,

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:48.980
given that the situation at Xinhai

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:49.980
is quite complex,

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:52.370
you can have a few

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:53.210
assistants.

00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:54.420
Also,

00:41:54.490 --> 00:41:55.610
for your safety,

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:56.460
you may carry

00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:57.430
a pistol, handcuffs,

00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:58.500
and other police equipment

00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:00.560
while executing the investigation.

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:03.070
Chief,

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:05.840
I'd like to request for a comrade

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:07.220
from outside the police system

00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:08.280
to be my assistant.

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:10.740
Your Mountain Patrol teammates

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:11.490
won't do.

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:14.910
I'd like to recommend my ex-husband,

00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:15.920
Shao Yunfei,

00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:16.860
a reporter for Western Evening News

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:17.860
based in Tianduo.

00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:20.580
He is politically reliable

00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:21.400
and highly sensitive

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:22.860
to environmental issues.

00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:24.170
More importantly,

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:25.320
he has done many reports

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:26.470
on Xinhai.

00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:27.500
Also,

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.080
his identity as a reporter

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:30.880
also provides excellent cover.

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:33.490
Chief Shi,

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:34.690
I think

00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:35.820
Officer Bai's request

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:36.680
is reasonable.

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:39.930
It's approved.

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:42.940
Chief,

00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:44.920
I believe there is one person

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:46.010
who should be a major suspect

00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:47.570
in this case we are investigating.

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:48.170
This person

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:50.320
is also linked to Xinhai's illegal mining.

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:50.820
I request permission

00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:52.550
to put him under surveillance.

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:55.680
You can buy anything over there.

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:57.300
Why go through all this trouble

00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:58.160
to mail it over?

00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:59.270
What if they don't like it?

00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:00.020
Why bother?

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:00.950
It shows

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:01.980
that we care.

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:05.100
You can't get this hardcover edition

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:07.600
of the Four Great Classical Novels abroad.

00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:08.880
I'm going out for a bit.
