[Born to Be Alive]

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.190
[Episode 38]

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.539
Zhacuo!

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:47.950
Zhacuo!

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.810
Really getting old.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:56.780
So slow.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.340
Manager Zhao.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.340
Manager Zhao.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.940
Zhacuo!

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.320
What happened?

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.840
What happened?

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.000
Get to the hospital, fast.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.170
He's lost too much blood.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.570
He won't make it
to the provincial capital.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.810
Is this how you handle things?

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.260
Wake up.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:39.660
Don't sleep.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.250
What do we do?

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.400
Drive faster!

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.690
No, I mean behind us.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.540
It's been following us for half an hour.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:55.760
Baima,

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.130
are you at the pasture?

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:37.560
Zhacuo,

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:38.460
it's catching up.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.060
Keep driving! Keep driving!

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:03.410
Get out.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.560
Friend,

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.500
is something wrong?

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.760
You ruined my pasture.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:09.750
What pasture?

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:10.910
My pasture.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:12.340
I followed

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.540
the tire tracks ahead of me.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.800
See? You've admitted.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:15.560
These tracks

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.510
were made by you.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.149
No.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.829
They were made by the car ahead of me.

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:19.630
The car ahead?

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.190
Why didn't I

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.130
see it?

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.870
It just passed.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:22.690
Right there.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.510
Ahead?

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.370
Where ahead?

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:26.920
I didn't see anything.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.980
I only saw you.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:31.100
Hey, you,

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.150
watch your attitude.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.270
You ruined our pasture,

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.200
and you still...

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.050
Is this enough?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.800
Well...

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.060
This pasture

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.760
doesn't belong to just me.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.659
Ask my brothers here.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.220
We're almost at the hospital.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.290
Hang in there.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:39.430
Hello?

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.020
In the major hospitals in the city,

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.180
I've arranged people to watch.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.980
Rest assured.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.000
Okay.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.370
Keep a close eye.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.760
I'm coming right over.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.130
Wait.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.159
Bai Ji!

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.120
Bai Ji!

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.070
Come here, quick!

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.950
Yunfei?

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.520
Doctor!

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:56.280
Who is this?

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.180
Doctor!

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.060
What happened?

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.540
What happened?

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:59.060
Doctor, come here!

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.930
How did this happen?

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:00.650
Hurry, hurry!

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:01.310
Easy, easy!

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.520
Come on!

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.160
Where is Mom?

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.090
Mom is upstairs.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.570
Go, go!

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:05.190
Go get her!

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.810
Go get her!

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:06.260
Over here!

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.320
Let's go! Let's go!

[Tianduo Deji Hospital]

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.370
Where is the emergency room?

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:24.310
What are you doing?

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:25.770
I'm asking you a question!

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:27.340
Sorry,

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:27.920
Miss.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.130
We are friends of the injured man

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.000
who was just brought in.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.980
We're very worried about him.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.180
His name is Zhao Yuji.

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:33.850
The one with the knife wound, right?

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:34.170
Yes.

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:35.540
Turn left ahead.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:13.600
What are you doing?

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.460
Where is Zhao Yuji?

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:18.540
Police! Drop the knife!

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:18.950
Freeze!

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.200
Let him go! Stand against the wall!

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:20.880
Ju!

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:21.650
Save me!

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:23.360
Bai Ji.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.450
Are you okay?

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:26.530
He has a knife!

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:30.190
Did that scare you?

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:30.760
Scare?

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:31.730
Me?

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:33.990
I've seen it all.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:52.640
Why do we meet here?

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.100
Aren't you afraid

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:56.340
of being seen?

00:07:58.130 --> 00:07:59.390
You really are scared.

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:01.160
That's not like you.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:04.920
You said you'd ask your friends
in the province

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.250
to keep an eye on things.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.560
Is this how they do it?

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:08.620
Zhao Yuji is now

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.150
in the provincial capital.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:13.620
It happened so suddenly.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.470
News didn't travel that fast.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.430
Besides,

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:21.450
before they left,

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.440
I had already told you.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.810
Your people failed to stop them.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:29.900
Why are you blaming me?

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:30.990
Alright, alright.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.409
Let's not talk about useless things now.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.240
The key is what to do next.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:37.909
At the mine,

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.470
should we scale back?

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.260
Lin.

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.940
How can you laugh at a time like this?

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.220
Why can't I?

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:54.550
Come.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:55.740
Look.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:58.380
Look at this.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.540
Look how well Tianduo

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:01.750
has been developed.

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:03.910
It's so beautiful.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.120
The people
from the Discipline Inspection Commission

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:06.790
don't care

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.220
how well you've built it.

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:12.150
They only calculate

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:13.870
what they want to.

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:26.110
Let them calculate then.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.480
What are you afraid of?

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:34.520
Zhao Yuji's matter

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.830
was so many years ago.

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:37.650
He signed the contract himself

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.320
to sell the company.

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:41.740
Later,

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.140
his leg was broken.

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.640
It's just a charge of disorderly conduct.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.760
All the accusations against us

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.840
are just his imagination.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:53.830
That case was settled years ago.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.000
Digging it up now

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:01.580
won't do any good.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:12.520
What about Jianshe?

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.140
That's a minor issue.

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:19.250
At most,

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:21.240
I concealed from the organization

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.570
my child's information.

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:24.630
It's just a disciplinary violation.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.200
As long as what Xinhai

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.390
is doing now

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.320
doesn't get exposed,

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.210
I have a way to get through this.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:37.840
Don't worry about that.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.280
I know what I'm doing.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:45.140
That is the one thing

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.470
I dread hearing you say.

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:50.500
How many times have your people messed up?

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:52.500
If it happens again,

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:55.810
no one can save you.

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:26.430
You...

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.430
Why were you sitting in the dark?

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:29.840
Come here.

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:31.720
I've bought

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.780
your plane ticket.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.000
It's to Beijing.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.060
Once you get there,

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.530
apply for a visa immediately.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:37.730
When you get the visa,

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:38.720
go abroad immediately

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.720
and find Jianshe.

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:41.090
What's wrong?

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:42.890
Is Jianshe in trouble?

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:45.600
Or is it our grandson?

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:51.630
Wait a minute.

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:52.490
Me, go abroad?

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.470
How can I leave

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.360
just like that?

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.080
Song Ping?

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:16.340
What does this mean?

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:21.390
It means

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:26.120
from now on,

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.460
your name is Song Ping.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:35.530
Lin.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.200
Are you...

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.780
Is there really no other way?

00:12:58.540 --> 00:12:59.390
As it stands,

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:04.580
this is our only option.

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:15.850
The flight is tomorrow morning.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.400
Go pack your bags quickly.

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:19.110
Don't bring too much,

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:20.970
to avoid attention.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:23.120
Go ahead.

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:44.850
Is this my fault?

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:49.940
Did I

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:54.100
push you too hard sometimes?

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.510
No, how would...

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:04.140
It's not your fault.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.230
You did it for Jianshe,

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:08.250
for this family.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:16.550
[Xining Huiren Hospital]

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.200
Since things are stable,

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.430
I'll go back today.

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:27.030
There are still many patients in Tianduo

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:28.130
waiting for me.

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:30.370
Mom.

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:33.970
Bai Ju and I

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.730
didn't mean to keep it from you.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.890
We just couldn't talk about it.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:40.020
I understand.

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:43.180
Thanks, Mom.

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:46.050
No need to thank me.

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:48.670
I want to wait

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.390
for the old man

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:50.410
to recover a bit

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:51.080
and explain the situation

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:51.980
to the organization

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.860
before going back.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:53.790
It's only right.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.190
It's your job.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:57.130
You must finish what you started.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:01.960
It's happening again.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:04.540
Why do I always drop the ball

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:05.740
at critical moments?

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:08.850
Over 10 years ago,

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:12.460
I went with Captain Duojie

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:13.170
to Beijing.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.200
In Beijing, we heard

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.660
something happened to the Mountain Patrol.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.350
When we came back, everything had changed.

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:22.350
But now,

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.300
it's another critical moment.

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:31.080
Why is it that every time

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.800
Bai Ju needs me,

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:34.840
I can't be

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:36.170
by her side?

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:39.820
Put that way,

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.240
I am pretty incompetent.

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:43.490
Incompetent at what?

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:45.500
Shao, I've noticed

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.390
you're sharp

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:48.810
and progressive at work,

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:50.370
but when it comes to personal matters,

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:51.700
you're so backward.

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:54.310
I can see

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.170
how Bai Ju feels about you.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.190
She likes you

00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:59.380
not because

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:00.860
of what you do for her,

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:02.000
but because

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.580
of who you are.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.700
Don't think about anything else now.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.000
Just do your job.

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:12.920
I think staying here

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:14.420
and holding down the fort

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:16.000
are what she wants most.

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:25.650
Is the fish ready?

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:27.550
Almost.

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:28.490
Hurry up.

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:43.600
Hurry.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:46.170
Mom!

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.000
They're back.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.220
Shao.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:51.880
You're back.

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:55.600
We're back.

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:04.130
Mom.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:21.510
It's been a while.

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:23.170
It feels like

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:24.270
the whole family has not

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:25.730
sat down for a meal in ages.

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:29.400
We're not all here, though.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:31.180
True.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.390
Isn't Yan

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:33.570
on duty today?

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:35.070
Right.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:36.160
Next time, Bai Chun

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.490
can't be absent either.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.090
Bai Ji.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:42.910
Come on.

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:43.920
Taste

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:45.280
the fish I made.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:48.590
Your sister went early in the morning

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:49.850
to the market to buy it.

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:50.780
It's very fresh.

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:56.370
Do you really think I came here to eat?

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:58.930
Like I'm desperate for a meal?

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:01.140
What did we say on the way here?

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:02.450
Didn't we agree to talk nicely?

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:03.510
What are you doing?

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:04.860
Weren't you curious on the way here

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:05.500
about what happened

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:06.430
at the hospital?

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:07.200
Ask her.

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:08.240
The person who knows best

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.500
is sitting right here.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.010
Shao asked me the whole way.

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:12.740
I didn't know

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:13.830
what to tell her.

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:15.680
All I know is that we helped a witness.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.800
Is this witness related

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.710
to Xinhai?

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:21.880
You and Brother-in-Law...

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.660
You and ex-Brother-in-Law,

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:25.220
what inside info have you found

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:26.880
about Xinhai?

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.220
Bai Ji.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:31.970
You're really

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.420
putting me on the spot.

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:34.970
Fine.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:36.090
Can this

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.270
witness's testimony

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:38.510
take down Xinhai?

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:41.570
All I can say is,

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:43.110
it's not

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:44.050
that simple.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.140
That tells us nothing.

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.410
I sent you info

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.160
on 3 third-party

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.490
testing agencies.

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:00.550
Shao Yunfei and I

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:01.810
picked them together.

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:03.460
Look them over

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:04.310
and see

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:05.330
which one to pick.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.980
They are all authorities

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.260
on grass seed testing.

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:11.050
We also discussed it.

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:12.320
If later on,

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.840
you have to pay a penalty,

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:16.170
I'll sell my apartment

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.220
to help you out.

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:20.440
Ju,

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:23.210
you're a leader of some sort.

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:24.200
How can you be

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.480
so naive?

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:26.520
Finding

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:27.160
a testing agency

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.760
won't solve the problem now.

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:29.610
Let alone a third party,

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:30.090
even a fourth

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:31.120
or eighth party won't help.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:31.690
Bai Ji.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:32.790
Save it.

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:34.110
What are you doing?

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:37.050
I finally get it.

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:39.110
He just wants to screw me,

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.320
screw us.

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:42.270
I don't know

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:43.790
what kind of backing he has.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:45.210
I only know one thing now—

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.180
facing these people,

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:48.360
if we keep retreating,

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.020
we'll have nowhere left to go.

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:51.540
Only by fighting back

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:52.470
can we...

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:54.270
might we protect our family

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:55.960
and what's important.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:01.310
Anyway, I'm not good

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:02.260
at big speeches.

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:04.300
That old man

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:05.560
is the best example.

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:17.920
Mom.

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:20.930
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:22.300
You said everything

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.890
I wanted to say.

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:25.640
What else is there for me to say?

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:30.660
Sure enough.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.180
Experience teaches better than words.

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:35.470
That's good.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.570
You've grown up.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:43.580
Come on, eat.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:45.960
Ju made this fish especially for you.

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:51.010
Thanks, Ju.

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.550
Ju,

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:55.170
let's eat.

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:05.580
What's going on?

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.940
Why didn't you call me for a meal?

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:11.350
You're finally back.

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:13.720
I'm back.

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:19.320
It's ready?

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:20.000
Yeah.

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:28.460
Shao has good taste.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.990
These beans have a strong berry aroma.

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:31.640
Really?

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.850
You should learn how to make it.

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:36.200
It's simple.

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:38.770
You two are both

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:39.980
fancy people from the big city.

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.720
I don't have the energy to learn.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:42.650
It's just a cup of coffee.

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:45.180
You're being prejudiced
against our region.

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:47.810
What's wrong?

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.480
What does Chun want to talk to you about?

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.850
He's acting all mysterious.

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:52.670
Don't pry.

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:53.770
Finish your coffee

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:54.460
and go home.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:55.490
It's hot.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:03.550
Chun.

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:06.070
You'd better

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.590
think it through before you speak.

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:10.980
For some things,

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:12.330
once you tell me,

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:14.530
as a police officer—

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:17.060
Xinhai is indeed involved
in illegal mining.

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:20.520
During the inspection,

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:21.850
someone tipped them off

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:23.220
in advance.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.220
Meng Yaohui took us

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.280
to forge the scene,

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:29.280
covering up the illegal mining

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.620
to deceive the inspection team.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:33.760
Do you have evidence?

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:36.480
Is a witness enough?

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:37.900
There's a miner

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:38.980
who was injured at the site.

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:40.180
He had an amputation.

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:42.760
But Xinhai used money

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.560
to suppress the whole incident.

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:45.460
I'm not sure

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:46.990
if he's willing to testify.

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:48.850
We still need

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:50.310
substantial evidence.

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:51.560
For example,

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.930
photos or videos of the scene,

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:55.050
or sales records

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:56.650
and financial transactions

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:57.510
regarding the illegal mining.

00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:58.440
Anything works.

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:00.110
Regarding this,

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:01.080
Meng Yaohui, from the very beginning,

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.610
set up off-the-book accounts.

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:03.260
He established

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:04.380
a separate finance office.

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:05.220
It's not accounted for

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:06.660
with the group's finances.

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:07.290
And he never lets

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:08.330
unauthorized personnel near it,

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:09.200
including me.

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:15.140
These past few days,

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:18.150
I've been watching Meng Yaohui.

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:26.340
When did you plant that?

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:52.650
Mr. Meng.

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:57.310
Mr. Meng.

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:01.260
You're awake.

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.290
The rain is really heavy.

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:06.570
It hasn't stopped yet.

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:08.810
As someone who has been to Bolamula,

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:12.670
you shouldn't say things like that.

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:14.530
Thanks for seeing me home.

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:16.250
Bye.

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:18.660
Bai Ju.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.730
You've been to Bolamula

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:25.100
so many times.

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:27.440
You've been through

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.410
so much.

00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:31.300
Have you ever thought about

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:34.570
living a good life?

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:39.880
What counts as a good life?

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:42.640
Looking forward.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:45.330
Choosing

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.200
a smoother path,

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:49.380
not a lonely one.

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:52.940
But I don't feel lonely.

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.320
I used to have the Captain

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:57.730
and friends.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:00.920
I still do now.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:03.110
To me,

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:06.280
they've always been with me.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.770
They've never left.

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:09.570
Besides,

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:12.230
I'm not afraid of being alone.

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:16.760
Goodbye.

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:32.990
These few days,

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:34.500
I've only seen

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.000
his daily routine.

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:40.460
You've done plenty.

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:42.660
Leave the rest to me.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:44.840
Chun.

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.480
If you really find evidence,

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:50.720
what should you do?

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:52.900
The forces behind Xinhai

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:54.030
are complicated.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:56.590
You'll definitely get implicated.

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:00.040
But my little sister is a police officer.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.430
She will protect me.

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:04.870
But what if your little sister

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:06.200
smashes your rice bowl?

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.010
But I'm a stone.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:10.850
From the army

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:12.820
to the coal mines,

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.290
no matter where I am,

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:15.680
I find

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:16.720
my place.

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:18.940
Wherever I'm needed,

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:19.960
that's where I go.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.220
I know

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:23.610
that right now, the one who needs me most

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:24.480
is my sister.

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:26.490
So I have to stand firmly

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:27.580
by her side.

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:29.490
No one can move me.

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:35.110
I said you were a stone,

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:37.160
not a brick.

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:40.250
To be moved wherever needed.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.300
If you need me to be,

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:49.530
I can also be a brick.

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:52.610
After all these years,

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:54.340
I know you are

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.000
a responsible police officer.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000
I just hope

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:59.160
you can achieve your goal

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.730
and stay safe.

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:04.290
As for the future,

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:06.470
whether you're alone

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:08.050
or with someone,

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:12.230
it'll be fine as long as you're happy.

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:18.170
That second part

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:21.140
sounds just like Mom.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:26.590
Mom loves you.

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:39.750
And so do I.

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:46.010
I know.

00:27:57.550 --> 00:27:58.000
Chun.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:02.700
I'm off.

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:04.770
Off now?

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:15.240
Is it good?

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:22.810
All right.

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:24.070
Stop drinking coffee.

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:25.160
Have some fruit.

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:30.980
Come clean.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:33.170
How much did you overhear?

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:36.330
I wasn't eavesdropping. Really.

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:41.000
Fine.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.610
I just caught the tail end.

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:44.690
I didn't hear much.

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:53.030
It's not some

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:54.310
dirty secret.

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:56.280
There's nothing to eavesdrop on.

00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:57.490
The fact that Chun likes you?

00:28:57.490 --> 00:28:58.860
I've known it for ages.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.850
You never felt it?

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:12.070
I...

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:17.860
Really.

00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:20.720
I just pretended not to know.

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:22.340
Think about it.

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:23.000
When we were kids,

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.090
all those love letters

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:25.020
boys gave you—

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.970
Chun confiscated them all.

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:28.930
He never cared about me growing up.

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:30.260
He only cared about you.

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:31.610
I even secretly confronted him,

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:33.140
asking why he was so biased.

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:34.640
Just from his reaction,

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:35.720
well,

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:37.160
any idiot could tell

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.350
it was because he liked you.

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:47.160
You're so dense.

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.290
What should I do?

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:54.440
What is there to do?

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:55.580
It's been so long.

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:57.140
It's ancient history.

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:16.340
I love you, too.

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:20.540
Just like how Chun

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:22.140
and Mom do to you.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.000
Don't get emotional yet.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.750
I have my limits.

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:31.100
Work is work,

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:33.640
but safety comes first.

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:34.230
Got it?

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:37.530
Also,

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:39.570
I have to take Han with me.

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:43.410
That's not up to me.

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:46.300
You have to ask if he's willing.

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:48.100
He wouldn't dare to refuse.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.500
If he refuses,

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:53.470
I'll put him in a chokehold

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.030
and drag him away.

00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:56.420
You're choking me?

00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:57.900
Assaulting a police officer!

00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:58.200
I...

00:30:58.550 --> 00:30:59.480
Police assault!

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:00.530
Go ahead and scream.

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:01.880
Sue me.

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:03.860
So annoying.

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.280
You're so annoying.

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:32.540
Why do you

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:34.010
still drive this old car?

00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:35.790
Didn't Shao buy you

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:36.920
a new one?

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:38.940
She told you?

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.420
The new car is at home.

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:45.150
It's too nice.

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:46.510
I can't bear to drive it.

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:48.560
This old thing,

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.170
patch it up,
and it'll run for a few more years.

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:54.770
You two,

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:55.750
breaking up one minute,

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:57.550
and getting back together next.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.320
Are you playing us for fools?

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:00.800
Impermanence.

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:03.060
That's life.

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:05.350
Don't give me that Zhacuo crap.

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:07.420
Han.

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:10.110
Since you've made up,

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:12.790
as for future matters,

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:14.590
you should stay out of them.

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:15.220
Bai.

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:19.150
I think impermanence

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:20.410
means the unexpected.

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:22.790
I thought I would

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:23.990
be single all my life.

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.420
Who knew at my age,

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:28.500
I'd meet Bai Shao.

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:30.090
You didn't meet her

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:30.780
at this age.

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:33.270
It was 18 years ago

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:34.200
that you met her.

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:42.240
I couldn't have imagined it
18 years ago either.

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:45.700
We weren't going to take you on patrol.

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:48.370
We all thought

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:49.780
you wouldn't last.

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:52.830
But you've kept at it

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:55.380
until now.

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:04.140
Bai,

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:07.220
I have to keep working with you.

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:14.180
Mom.

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:15.880
Mom.

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:17.620
Slow down. Slow down.

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:18.530
Slow down. Slow down.

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:19.950
Slow down. With your old arms and legs,

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:21.950
you shouldn't carry so many things.

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:23.570
You came back early

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:24.700
without telling me.

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.590
Good thing I bought a lot of groceries.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:27.900
Since you bought so many,

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:29.300
are we expecting guests?

00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:31.110
I'm always prepared.

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:33.980
Last time,

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:35.590
when Bai came to visit,

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.520
we had a really good chat.

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:38.680
I heard.

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:41.310
I can tell

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:42.110
that she is

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:43.640
a little interested in you.

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:45.100
When a woman

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:46.920
cares about a man's past,

00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:48.700
that says a lot.

00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:49.970
By the way,

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:52.090
it seems a colleague of yours

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:53.070
got into trouble.

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:54.330
Bai is looking for him.

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:55.770
Who?

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:56.810
The one who picked you up

00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:58.290
to work in Guangdong.

00:33:58.680 --> 00:33:59.490
Wang.

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.170
But I didn't tell her

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:05.570
it had to do with you.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:07.630
Better to avoid trouble.

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.179
How about that?

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:10.790
I'm not that stupid, am I?

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:14.580
Tell me earlier next time,

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:15.949
so I can explain to her.

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.719
What's there to explain?

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:19.020
If she doesn't mention it,

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:19.980
just let it go.

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:22.610
Let's go. Time to eat.

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:25.860
Here.

00:34:25.989 --> 00:34:27.170
Bye, Uncle Han.

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.730
Get in the car, Zhuling.

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:28.320
Bye.

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:38.800
Auntie Wang.

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.330
Bai, are you busy?

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:41.400
No, I'm not. Go ahead.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.199
What's wrong?

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:44.060
I was just about to cook,

00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:44.980
but Yaohui

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:46.420
left in a hurry.

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:48.650
He's gone to Dingduo County again?

00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:49.290
Yes.

00:34:49.949 --> 00:34:51.679
My intuition is usually right.

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:53.300
He didn't have any plans.

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:54.989
He just decided to go on a whim.

00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:57.480
Maybe he's gone to see someone.

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:00.830
Okay, I understand, Auntie.

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:02.080
I'll find him

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:03.300
and get to the bottom of it.

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:04.180
Okay, okay.

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:05.810
Thanks, Auntie.

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:27.420
Drink up.

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:30.890
Where are you going?

00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:32.160
To patrol the mountain.

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.360
Patrol the mountain?

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:34.650
Just the two of you?

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.510
Even if I'm the only one left,

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:37.770
I still have to patrol.

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:40.460
He's confused.

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:44.340
He still thinks it's the 90s.

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:54.420
I won! I won!

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:54.960
Look.

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:56.210
I'm amazing.

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.780
You each have to

00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:57.940
buy me a popsicle.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.380
Aren't you afraid
of getting a stomachache?

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:01.150
A bet is a bet.

00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:02.440
It's not my fault you didn't win.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.280
If you're so good,

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.610
go buy a lottery ticket.

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:11.780
He said his start-up failed,

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:13.520
but actually,
he loves buying lottery tickets,

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.450
hoping to strike it rich every day.

00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:49.210
Excuse me. Excuse me.

00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:58.040
Wang Jian.

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.130
What do you want?

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:01.170
Who are you?

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:02.540
Sorry.

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:04.830
I mistook you for someone else. Apologies.

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:05.960
Weirdo.

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:28.010
Mr. Meng.

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:30.200
You've got the wrong person.

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:31.540
No, I haven't.

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:32.680
It is you, Mr. Meng.

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:36.570
It really is you, Mr. Meng.

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:39.590
Is something the matter?

00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:41.160
Meeting you here

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:42.450
is such a coincidence.

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:43.770
As the saying goes,

00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:45.430
fate brings people together.

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:47.670
Is this a chance encounter?

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:49.210
I have things to do.

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:49.940
I'm leaving.

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:52.750
Don't be in a rush, Mr. Meng.

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.480
Regarding the proposal

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:55.700
we talked about before,

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:57.500
we've discussed it thoroughly,

00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.320
and we all think it's pretty good.

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.120
That's right.

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:01.350
I heard

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:02.910
you can arrange a job for me,

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.860
and the salary is negotiable.

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:35.360
How did that person

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.450
claiming to be Wang Fumin's friend

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:37.660
contact you?

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:39.940
Days after you

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.370
visited my house

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:42.160
last time,

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:43.790
he called me.

00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:45.490
He said his surname is Chen,

00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:47.240
and that he's an old colleague of my dad,

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:49.570
who went abroad
to work with him back then.

00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:51.770
I didn't believe him at first,

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:53.570
but he accurately stated

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:54.590
my dad's

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:55.690
remittance times

00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:56.950
and amounts back then.

00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:58.070
He also said my dad

00:41:58.090 --> 00:41:59.690
took good care of him abroad,

00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:02.410
and that he wanted to repay the kindness.

00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:04.850
So he paid off your debts for you.

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:06.050
He put another 500,000

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:06.940
into your card.

00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:12.790
Did you ask him

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:15.000
where your father is now?

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:16.190
I did.

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:18.350
He said he didn't know either.

00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:19.380
He said it was because

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:20.330
he couldn't find my father

00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:21.980
that he came to me.

00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:25.050
He also bought me a house

00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:26.280
in Dingduo County.

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:27.630
He said he wanted to help me

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:29.320
improve my living conditions.

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:30.140
So generous.

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:32.920
What are the plans for the next step?

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:34.800
For the future,

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:36.530
he said he'd send me abroad

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:38.360
and arrange a good job for me.

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:39.610
How do you contact

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:40.940
this guy surnamed Chen?

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:42.320
Just...

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:43.430
by phone.

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:44.920
Haven't you met him in person?

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:45.470
No.

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:47.400
He sounded like he was

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:49.020
in his thirties or forties.

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:52.960
Do you know Zhou Fusheng?

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:55.120
Who?

00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:57.150
The owner of the account
that sent you money

00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:58.410
is named Zhou Fusheng.

00:42:58.510 --> 00:42:59.780
A migrant worker from the south.

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:00.960
He has admitted
that he was short of money,

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:02.630
so he sold his ID card to someone else.

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:03.550
Why do you think

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:05.900
this Chen guy used a fake identity

00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:06.950
to get close

00:43:06.970 --> 00:43:07.800
to you?
