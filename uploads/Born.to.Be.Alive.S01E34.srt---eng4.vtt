[Episode 34]

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:46.190
Why are you looking at me?

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.729
You look great in this outfit.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.180
Just as good as back then.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.850
Look.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.480
Comrade Bai Ju, stop laughing.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.370
It's your turn.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.070
I want to set up a forestry police unit.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.180
I saw this at home a few days ago.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.770
So I transferred it to my phone.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.590
I thought you might want to see it.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.000
It would be best

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.190
if we could also get

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.460
a helicopter.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.579
With 40,000 square kilometers,

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.840
patrolling the mountains
would only take a day.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.430
Then just fly

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.500
straight back to the county

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.030
and go home to take a shower.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.050
That would be pure bliss.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.890
It feels like...

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.710
a lifetime ago.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.010
I can't believe

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.240
I used to do that.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:12.350
Captain.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.790
Your turn.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.550
Give us a summary.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.430
Let me talk about my dream.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.340
I hope that in the future,

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.000
the world

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.090
will no longer need nature reserves.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:37.340
Bai Ju.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.270
All these years,

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:42.730
you haven't changed a bit.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:44.079
All these years,

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:45.210
along the way,

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.280
you could give up anything.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.460
But I believe you won't stop.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.270
Besides, you're divorced now.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.160
You can't stop.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:58.510
You can't.

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.850
Director Huang, Director Huang.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:37.550
About this regreening project,

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.159
wasn't it agreed

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:39.220
that 2 companies would do it together?

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.630
Why has it now

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.010
gone solely to Xinhai?

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.659
Exactly.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:42.640
The regreening area is so huge,

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.950
and you just give it all to them?

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.130
We have technical teams too.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.830
We can guarantee

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:46.570
the quality.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.440
Didn't I tell you?

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.790
I don't have the final say on this.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.670
The city has issued the document.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.280
Didn't you hear what Mayor Wang said

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.610
at the meeting just now?

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:57.800
Alright, alright.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.600
It's settled.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.030
Director Huang.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:01.780
Director Huang!

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:02.520
Forget it.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.250
Don't you get it?

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.590
Mayor Wang decided this.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:07.910
The original plan to have 2 companies

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:08.890
do the regreening project

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.350
was proposed by Vice Mayor Lin.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.060
He didn't even show up today.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.690
Forget it.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:14.830
Let's go. Let's go.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.970
Let's go.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:22.640
Mayor Wang,

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.300
take care.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:25.810
Goodbye, Mr. Feng.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:46.420
Chun.

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.330
How much severance pay do you think

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.530
the mine will give us?

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:51.570
Who told you

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.070
we're being laid off?

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.480
Where's your

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.610
"Don't believe or spread rumors" now?

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:58.320
Do we really need to hear it from others?

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.120
Those with connections

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.130
are already looking for their next job.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.570
It's just us

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.430
who are still stuck here waiting.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.020
The group spent a fortune

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:08.970
on the integration before.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.930
There's not much left in the accounts now.

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.070
I heard from Mr. Meng

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.010
that the whole group

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.410
is struggling right now.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.030
The severance package

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.640
won't be ready anytime soon.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:18.970
Don't worry.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.340
Just wait a bit longer.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.980
Wait?

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.060
Let me tell you,

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.870
that Meng guy

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:24.930
is just fooling you.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:25.860
Struggling?

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.220
Those coal bosses

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.000
are only thinking about

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.510
how to stuff more money

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:29.800
into their own pockets.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.430
Exactly.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:31.560
They surely have enough money

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.180
to last them for their next lives.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.250
Now that they're done with the mine,

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.310
they can take the money and live it up.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.860
What's that phrase again?

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.110
Anyway, it means

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:41.180
being totally free.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.220
You mean financial freedom?

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.070
No.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.800
M-Mr. Meng.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:45.350
Mr. Meng.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:46.540
Having lunch?

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.770
Have you eaten, Mr. Meng?

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.170
I have. You guys go ahead.

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:50.980
You guys chat.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.020
We will head out first.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.220
Right, right, right.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.810
Goodbye.

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.930
Mr. Meng.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.740
Don't take it to heart.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:05.480
Mining suspension

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.220
is hard for everyone to accept.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.250
Those two were actually

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:09.180
being polite.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.620
You haven't heard about

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:11.730
what those workers from Mine No. 2 said.

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:12.660
It's much worse.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:13.700
Mine No. 2?

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:16.680
After Wu Jiang's accident,

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.240
didn't Mine No. 2

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.970
become completely unmanaged?

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:19.980
These past few days,

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:20.560
I've been cleaning up

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.660
this mess for him.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.680
As the assistant to the General Manager,

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.210
you're neglecting your duties.

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:27.940
You don't even think to help me.

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:29.800
Mining is fully banned now.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.130
What else is there to do?

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:32.810
Regreening.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.120
You have experience with this.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:36.700
Didn't your Mine No. 1

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:37.360
research

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.040
grass planting technology before?

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:39.510
We just

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.240
did a few experiments on our own.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.570
But when we reported it,

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.670
the group wasn't very interested,

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:44.940
so we didn't continue.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.540
Times have changed.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:48.990
Now,

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.420
this is the top priority.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.159
Xinhai will take over

00:07:53.159 --> 00:07:54.960
the mine's regreening project.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.260
So,

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:57.720
are you up for the job?

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.060
That's a good thing.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:02.710
Does that mean

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:03.310
the company can

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:04.390
keep some staff

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.900
to carry out the project?

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:07.430
We need to control the numbers

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:08.760
to avoid overstaffing.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.310
Those two buddies of yours...

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:10.890
They did a pretty good job

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:11.950
in planting grass.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.120
They were the most active.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.640
With the layoffs, can we...

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.100
You've got the wrong idea.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.760
I want to borrow them from you.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:20.590
Transfer them to Mine No. 2

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:21.570
to work on the regreening project

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:22.220
to help me.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.420
No problem.

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:25.250
Come in.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.360
Mr. Meng, are you in a meeting?

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:28.390
The room you asked for

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:29.060
is ready.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.690
How would you like it set up?

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:31.710
Cleaning up a room?

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:32.370
Let me help.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:33.289
Bai Chun.

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:36.570
I'm just clearing out a room

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:37.630
to store some junk.

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:39.240
You go do your work.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:44.900
Don't make copies

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:46.460
of this key for anyone else.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.340
I'll keep it.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:48.950
Got it, Mr. Meng.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.280
[Kunlun Restaurant]

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:02.320
Yunfei.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:03.810
You're here.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.390
Two boxed meals.

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:06.670
One meat, one veggie.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:07.170
Okay.

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:08.870
No, no, no.

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:09.580
Use mine.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:11.150
Sure.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.100
Mr. Bai.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.540
How's it going?

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:30.410
The coal mine shut down just like that.

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:31.320
Those bosses

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.660
are getting ready to move out.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:33.920
Every time I go collect debt,

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.320
they just tell me to wait.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:36.030
If I wait any longer,

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:37.630
my restaurant will go under.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:40.800
What does this mean?

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.340
It's payment for the debt.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:46.670
They paid me with a dog.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:51.100
It's alright.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:52.290
Selling boxed meals is fine too.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.010
It's good.

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:54.620
Zhuling loves boxed meals.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.120
I guess

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.780
you're back to your old trade.

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:59.800
Worst case, I'll close the restaurant

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:01.310
and go be a househusband.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:02.410
Yan

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:04.360
is about to become Chief Physician.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.070
Isn't that great?

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:06.480
If I'm a househusband,

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:08.050
I'll just cook for her alone.

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:08.980
I-I'll take care of her.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.180
Take good care of her.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:11.860
Living off your wife, huh?

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:12.280
What?

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.250
So?

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.410
What's wrong with living off my wife?

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:17.100
Someone can't pull it off
even if they try.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.410
You can just eat these...

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:19.810
bachelor's boxed meals.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:25.770
Hello.

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:29.550
Alright.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.440
Sure, no problem.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:33.110
Okay, okay.

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.600
See you later.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.660
Alright, alright.

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:35.640
Who was that?

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:37.680
Your sister.

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:38.240
My sister?

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.040
She called me.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:40.050
My sister called you?

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:41.310
Your sister called me.

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:42.840
I don't need the boxed meals.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:43.240
Look at

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.770
that smug look on your face.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:47.910
Since you don't need the boxed meals,

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:48.650
you don't want your box back?

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:49.980
I'll leave the box here.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.760
I don't even want this restaurant anymore.

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:19.150
Uncle Lin.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.040
Uncle Lin.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.250
Uncle Lin.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:24.270
I really can't keep up with you.

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:24.940
Bai Ji.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:26.320
You...

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:27.790
I thought

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.920
it was those small mine owners again.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:31.460
Sorry to disturb you.

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:32.870
It's the first time

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:34.330
I've seen you exercising.

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:35.460
Business isn't busy,

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.920
so I thought I'd exercise.

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:41.170
Your restaurant

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.960
must have been affected quite a bit.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:45.900
Uncle Lin.

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:48.920
There is something

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.320
I'd like to discuss with you.

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:53.410
Uncle Lin.

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:55.720
Is this request of mine

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.560
making things harder for you

00:11:57.890 --> 00:11:59.550
than those small mine owners?

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:00.540
Yes.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:04.000
Bai Ji.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.610
Regreening is a good thing.

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.200
But if you want to bid,

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.930
I can't put in a good word for you.

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:16.860
Everything must be legal,

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:17.760
compliant,

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:18.820
and fair.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:27.210
But if you are

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.620
really interested,

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:32.140
I can help you

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:34.050
by introducing a technology company.

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:34.790
Go find them first

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:35.650
and learn more.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:37.240
Okay, okay.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:37.970
That's great.

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:39.170
Thank you, Uncle Lin.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.530
Back then,

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.950
when you came back from
the Tanggula Road Maintenance Squad,

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:47.470
I told your mother

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:48.710
that this decision

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:50.770
would affect the child's future.

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:54.130
Later, when you got your own restaurant,

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:55.730
I was happy for you too.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.670
Now that you want to switch

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:01.390
to the regreening business,

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:03.240
you need to think it through.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.900
This is a long-term endeavor.

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:06.760
You won't make quick money.

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:07.980
But

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:10.650
it will benefit future generations.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.450
I think it's very meaningful.

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.350
Changqing Ecological Technology Company.

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:21.100
A grass-planting company.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:22.000
This name

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:23.050
sounds quite grand.

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:23.760
Of course.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:27.510
Have you made up your mind?

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:29.300
I've made up my mind.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:30.860
I'm selling the restaurant.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:31.790
I'm done with it.

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:33.940
The regreening business

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.370
is more profitable

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.770
and has a better future.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:39.860
If I do it well,

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.410
it will benefit future generations.

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.470
It's a great cause.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:44.320
Don't make it sound so big.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.080
To do this,

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.300
how much do you want to invest?

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.100
I discussed it with Chun.

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:51.670
This regreening project

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:52.790
is related to his work,

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:53.850
so he can't invest,

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:55.590
but he'll lend me some money.

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.220
Plus the money from selling the restaurant

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.100
and my savings over the years,

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:00.980
I can acquire

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:02.410
50% of the shares.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:06.900
But I think

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:08.890
if we're going to do it,

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:09.960
we should go big.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:11.890
Now, Mr. Chang

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:12.630
has agreed to transfer

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:14.340
80% of the shares.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.730
What's in it for him, then?

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.030
He worked so hard to build the business.

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:22.030
Why would he just hand it over to you?

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.690
You don't understand, Mom.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.090
First,

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:27.950
the market for grass seeds

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.790
is usually very niche.

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:32.940
It's only because we've caught

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:33.910
the wind

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.320
of this regreening project.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.310
So there's a chance

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:37.780
for mass production.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:38.530
Second,

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:40.290
they are pressed for time.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:40.930
He can't find

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:41.460
a suitable investor

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:42.650
in the short term.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.560
Without our investment,

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:45.270
he can't produce

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:46.270
on a large scale.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.120
So,

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.270
on the surface,

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:50.010
it looks like they're taking a hit.

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:51.320
But as long as the project
gets off the ground,

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.650
the actual money earned

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:54.550
will be much more than before.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:57.840
What did you mean

00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.200
by "pressed for time"?

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.120
This isn't just business.

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:02.890
It's a task assigned from above.

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:04.180
They have to complete

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:07.120
the pilot project in Xinhai
within the deadline.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:08.050
In Xinhai?

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:10.930
Yes.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:14.220
Xinhai is in charge of the coal mine's
regreening project.

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:14.940
I'm warning you,

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.270
don't work with Xinhai.

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:18.820
There might be problems there.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:19.750
Problems?

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.130
Is there something wrong
with Chun's workplace?

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:23.130
Don't listen to Ju's nonsense, Mom.

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:24.520
This is a task assigned by the province.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.050
Xinhai is just a pilot site.

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:27.130
What kind of problems could there be?

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:27.730
Besides,

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:28.820
the first pilot site

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.100
is at Chun's mine.

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:31.600
He's in charge.

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:32.620
Would he scam me?

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:35.890
I'm a public official.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.800
I can't be involved
in investment or business.

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:39.480
This matter

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.810
originally didn't have much to do with me.

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:42.810
But I still want to advise you

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:44.340
to think it over carefully.

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:47.180
If this is really such a good thing,

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.580
why didn't the company

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:50.400
find someone else to take over?

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:51.620
Why would such a good opportunity

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.020
fall right into your lap?

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.720
Why

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:55.220
can't it fall into my lap?

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:56.220
Why can't I

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.460
have a little bit of good luck?

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:58.430
Do I always have to be unlucky?

00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:59.820
That's not what I meant.

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:00.890
Why are you getting so worked up?

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:01.930
I think it's fine.

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:07.680
Ms. Bai has stated her position.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:08.130
Come on,

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:09.340
analyze it for us.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.250
Why do some people

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:17.780
work hard their whole lives

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:19.270
but never make much money,

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:21.020
while others

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.210
can seize opportunities
and make a fortune?

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:24.810
The key lies in information.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.170
For most people,

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:27.960
the channels to obtain

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:28.500
effective information

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:29.410
immediately

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.460
are very limited.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:31.640
But the channel Bai Ji used

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.440
to get the information this time

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.770
came from Uncle Lin.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.100
Exactly.

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:38.550
A company recommended by Uncle Lin.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.800
A path he pointed out.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.320
You really know your stuff, Shao.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.500
A real career woman.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:44.890
An entrepreneur.

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:46.290
Stop the nonsense.

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:47.670
Just tell us the truth,

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:50.020
how much capital are you short?

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:53.730
The transfer fee for my restaurant
is one million.

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:55.080
Chun lent me some money.

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:57.150
Plus my savings,

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.110
I can scrape together one million.

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:01.250
I'm still short one million.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:02.620
That much?

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:04.430
Mom.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:06.900
Mom.

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:10.119
My fixed deposit

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:11.270
can't be withdrawn.

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:13.640
I can only take out 100,000 now.

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:16.250
Is investing in you

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:17.349
gonna give a higher return
than the bank interest?

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:18.089
Yes,

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.260
much higher than

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:20.400
the bank's fixed deposit rate.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.160
The bank gives 3

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:21.890
to 4 percent.

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:23.270
I'll give you 14

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:24.069
or 15 percent.

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:24.950
Either is fine.

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:26.740
That high?

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.750
This isn't illegal fundraising, is it?

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:31.810
You need to spend less time
on the internet

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:32.590
for the wrong information.

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:33.880
What illegal fundraising?

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.410
There's a police officer
sitting right here.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:38.610
Ju, tell Mom,

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.220
is this illegal fundraising?

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:40.830
This counts as

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:42.460
a loan between family members.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.010
As long as it's used for legal business,

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:45.740
it's not illegal fundraising.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:47.880
Alright.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:49.700
With a police officer backing me up,

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:50.720
I'm relieved.

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:52.290
I support you.

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:54.350
I'll give 100,000.

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:55.290
Mom.

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.170
Since a police officer is backing you up,

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:57.810
just withdraw

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:58.740
all your fixed deposits.

00:17:58.740 --> 00:17:59.740
-Enough.
-No way.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:01.040
Don't eye Mom's

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:02.240
measly savings.

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:03.830
I'll cover

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:05.180
the remaining 900,000.

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:08.070
But I can't give

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:09.010
any more than that.

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:10.050
My business's working capital

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:10.630
can't be withdrawn.

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:11.960
Enough. That's enough.

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:13.270
Shao,

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:14.800
this 900,000 is more than enough.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.500
You'll be my major shareholder.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.200
Consider this money Mom's investment.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.400
Mom is the major shareholder.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:19.960
I don't want it.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.130
You have to take it.

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:22.760
Here, Mom, have some water.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.940
Shao, have some water.

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:28.570
Stop pouring.

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:33.390
Hello?

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:34.640
Ju,

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:35.610
can you talk?

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:37.440
I can. Go ahead.

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:39.200
There's a new development
in the Wu Jiang case.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.550
This Wu Jiang isn't Wu Jiang,

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:41.180
but we don't know

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:42.510
if Wu Jiang even exists.

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:43.000
Are you telling me

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.270
tongue twisters?

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:44.830
The Yunnan police

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:45.890
just contacted us.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.420
They said Wu Jiang's DNA

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.200
matches a suspect

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:48.740
from a 1997

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:49.720
drug trafficking case

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:50.350
in Yunnan.

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:51.950
1997?

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:52.920
Yes.

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:53.850
In 1997,

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.350
a drug dealer at the Yunnan border

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:57.120
had a shootout with anti-narcotics police.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.090
He was injured while escaping

00:18:58.090 --> 00:18:59.180
and left bloodstains.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.270
We can now confirm

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:01.790
that this fugitive drug suspect

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:02.460
is him.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:03.920
That means...

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:05.040
This Wu Jiang,

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:06.730
the Vice President of Xinhai,

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.120
has a fake identity and resume.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.780
Then do you know Li Yongqiang?

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.610
Li Yongqiang?

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:15.920
Do you know Wang Fumin?

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:17.680
This Wu Jiang at Xinhai

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.920
we investigated

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:19.570
is not the original Wu Jiang

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:21.230
from Mazhi Hongyuan Freight.

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:21.920
When Captain Duojie had the accident,

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.570
he was in Yunnan.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.650
He has an alibi.

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:26.500
So,

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:27.660
it couldn't be him

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:29.190
who killed Captain Duojie.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.360
[Yunnan Police Crack 17-Year-Old Case;
Former Drug Dealer Turned Company VP]

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:33.490
That means

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:35.190
the prime suspect

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:35.900
you're tracking now

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.200
has a fake identity.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.380
He isn't Wu Jiang.

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:45.650
Doesn't this mean
we're back to square one?

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.200
So up until now,

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:48.290
we can't confirm the person

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:49.010
who killed the Captain

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:49.640
is Wu Jiang,

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.740
nor can we prove the body

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:51.600
is the Captain.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:52.760
So what have we actually investigated?

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:53.890
Calm down.

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:00.790
At least one thing

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:01.650
is certain now.

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:03.380
Someone,

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:05.010
or perhaps an organization,

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:06.200
wants us to believe the body

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:06.960
is the Captain

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.560
and the murderer is Wu Jiang.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:10.790
And they killed Wu Jiang

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.690
because they want the police
to close the case

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:13.830
and bury the truth of this matter

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:15.140
forever.

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:16.660
Didn't we suspect

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:17.440
another person

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.330
before?

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:20.290
What is his name again?

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:21.710
Wang Fumin.

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:22.830
Right.

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:24.960
Right after the Captain went missing,

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.290
he ran off to South Asia.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.130
This guy is highly suspicious.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.770
How about I go to South Asia?

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:33.290
When I first bought my car,

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:34.200
I drove there myself.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.190
I know the route pretty well.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:36.120
What do you know?

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.350
How are you going to find him?

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:38.420
There's been no news of him

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:39.240
2 years after he left the country.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.640
We don't know if he's dead or alive!

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.220
Even his son

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:42.080
can't find him!

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:43.330
You certainly can't!

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:44.240
Since nothing works,

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.040
let's just stop investigating!

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:46.940
You go be a security guard,

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:48.000
and I'll go herd my cows!

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.070
That way, everyone is happy!

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:50.030
What are you saying?

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:51.380
Who said we're not investigating?

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:52.400
How are you going to find him there?

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.730
What's the noise about?

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:14.470
Look.

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:15.460
This big patch.

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:17.250
It has grown well

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:19.320
because we got plenty of rain.

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:21.010
Look at this patch.

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:23.580
This one isn't good.

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:25.160
The slope is too steep

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.300
to hold water and soil.

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:27.660
I'll have to redo it later.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:28.590
Look over there.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.280
Nothing has grown at all.

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:34.770
But

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:35.720
with the way

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:37.350
you guys scatter seeds,

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:39.230
I bet half of them just fed the birds.

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:40.360
Too inefficient.

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:43.870
There's a shotcrete machine
used in underground mines,

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:46.140
mixing the soil, sheep dung,

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:47.340
and grass seeds together.

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:48.020
You can add a bit of water,

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:49.690
then spray it directly onto the slope.

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:51.100
It's fast and even.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.920
You always have so many ideas.

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:55.050
A shotcrete machine

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:56.250
isn't cheap.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:57.500
I won't see results

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.460
anytime soon.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.800
Without cash flow,

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:00.480
whatever I do,

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.010
I have to consider the cost.

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:03.350
I have connections.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.290
We can rent one

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:06.010
for 30% of the price.

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:08.600
T-Thirty...

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:12.400
Later, I will go back

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:13.650
and run the numbers.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.320
I need to check the budget

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:16.000
and think about it.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Don't wait.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.180
Decide now.

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:20.310
I'll give you 10 seconds.

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:21.480
Or I'm out.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.180
10.

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:25.160
9.

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:26.460
8.

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:27.310
Chun.

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:27.800
7.

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:28.350
You're not even

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:29.610
trying to discuss this.

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:30.140
You...

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.290
Fine, fine.

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:31.750
Fine.

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.310
Go ahead and do it.

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:34.370
I've been worrying about

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:35.700
low efficiency anyway.

00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:38.280
Just wait for the results.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:39.230
I'm off.

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:56.940
Hello?

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:58.200
Meng.

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:00.010
You really forget people

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:01.640
once you're done with them.

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:03.490
I remember paying you

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:04.960
every single penny.

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:06.980
Take the money, close the shop,

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.170
take your people,

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:09.860
and never come back.

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:10.950
Meng.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.310
That'll cost extra.

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:15.650
You want me to close the shop,

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.160
but what about after that?

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.060
Ding and I

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:20.110
have mouths to feed.

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:22.040
Okay, I got it.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.170
I'll add more money.

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:26.230
Pick it up at the usual place.

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:27.740
Shen,

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:29.950
don't be like someone else.

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:31.670
Quit while you're ahead.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:55.370
Coming! Coming!

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:57.380
Leader.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:58.690
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:01.970
You're on the clock.

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:02.710
Where did you go?

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:03.770
I ate something bad

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:05.740
and had to use the bathroom.

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:09.880
Go get some medicine from the infirmary.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:10.810
Thanks, Leader.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:20.820
Talk to me.

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:22.040
Any news?

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:23.810
It's right up there.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:26.770
That Wang Fumin

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:28.670
didn't even resign

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.130
or take his salary.

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:31.730
He just vanished.

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:35.510
Same as what we knew.

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.360
What about the real Wu Jiang?

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.420
Haven't found him.

00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:39.830
Don't know.

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:43.050
I'm late.

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:47.930
Pour me some water.

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:52.180
Although the fake Wu Jiang is dead,

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:53.710
I've been working at Xinhai

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:54.900
for over a month now,

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.080
and I've finally got onto the night shift.

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:57.500
I took some

00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:59.160
interesting footage inside.

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:00.310
Do you want to see it?

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.760
Hurry up.

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:04.590
It concerns you.

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:06.120
Me?

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:17.770
Sir!

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:20.430
Are there any trucks behind you?

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:21.610
No, I'm the last one.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:23.050
Is something wrong?

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:23.740
No.

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:25.350
I'm covering a shift today.

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:26.140
I'm a little sleepy,

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:27.460
so I want to nap for a bit.

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:28.410
Okay, go ahead.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.050
It'll be a while

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:30.010
before we come down.

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:30.470
Really?

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.530
Okay.

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:32.440
Drive safe.

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:33.130
Okay, okay.

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:39.280
Coming! Coming!

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:40.980
Leader.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.220
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:43.280
I ate something bad

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.050
and had to use the bathroom.

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:01.350
Han, listen.

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:03.350
I tried everything

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:05.110
but couldn't get these photos.

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:06.950
Is this illegal mining?

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:08.610
Very likely.

00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:11.030
I also filmed this.

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:13.770
Look.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:15.480
During the day,

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.880
very few trucks go up to the mine.

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:17.900
But at night, the number of coal trucks

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:18.770
skyrockets.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.590
Doesn't this mean

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:22.000
that after the mining ban,

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:22.680
Xinhai has never

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:23.880
stopped production?

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:26.740
Han, I think

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:28.900
you have a gift for being an informant.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:31.480
Really.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.090
Is that so?

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:33.620
I even ran into Meng Yaohui,

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.450
and he didn't even catch me.

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:37.280
Next time, can you

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:38.910
film the mining area directly?

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:39.950
Take a video,

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:41.110
to make the chain of evidence complete

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:42.770
and leave Xinhai speechless.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:44.850
Later on,

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:45.440
I'll get you

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.440
a pinhole camera,

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:47.180
okay?

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:49.010
Yeah.

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:51.490
Since you care about the environment,

00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:52.920
you can just follow Shao

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.530
and do undercover work.

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.290
You don't know.

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:57.370
I can't get in

00:27:57.370 --> 00:27:58.700
that mining area at all.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:27:59.940
The road is full of patrols

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:00.980
at night.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:03.500
It's very strict.

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:06.740
We'll have to think of another way.

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.130
Stop thinking about it.

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:09.460
If you get caught,

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:10.630
even Bai Chun can't save you.

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:11.500
I know.

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:13.030
I was thinking of

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:14.630
posting it online directly.

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:15.700
But then I thought,

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:16.460
I was afraid of implicating

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:17.440
Bai Chun,

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:18.320
who got me into the mine.

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.380
So I didn't post it.

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:21.290
Keep backups

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:22.640
of these photos,

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:23.370
wait until the chain of evidence

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:24.460
is complete,

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:27.070
then submit everything to the authorities.

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:31.090
I don't want to.

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:34.450
The bosses at Xinhai

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.460
and the city leaders

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:36.960
are all

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:38.120
thick as thieves.

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:39.260
Everyone knows that.

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:40.790
The moment I hand this over,

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:41.520
it'll end up right

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.850
in Meng Yaohui's hands.

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:44.080
I'm not an idiot.

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:54.370
Here.

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:55.110
Chun, let me.

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:57.240
-Let me. Let me.
-It's okay. It's okay.

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.160
It's not heavy. It's not heavy.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.020
It's not heavy.

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:02.240
Um,

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:04.250
there's something
I want to talk to you about.

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:04.850
What is it?

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:07.860
How is Xinhai's regreening project

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:08.950
coming along?

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:12.490
Planning another investigative report?

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:13.090
No, no, no.

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:13.920
Just curious.

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:15.000
After all,

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:16.350
it's a key city project.

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:23.440
Chun, I'm curious.

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:24.790
You've worked in coal mines

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:25.770
for so many years.

00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:27.300
You know better than anyone

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:28.330
that the regreening project

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:29.530
is a losing business.

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:31.380
Just sowing grass seeds

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:32.830
and preventing soil erosion

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:34.720
require a huge investment.

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:37.520
It doesn't make financial sense.

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:39.420
Xinhai has no background

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:40.140
in environmental protection,

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:41.190
so why would a private company like it

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.790
be willing

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:42.920
to operate at a loss?

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:47.900
The policy has changed.

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:48.920
The state requires

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.090
ecological restoration of mines.

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:51.850
Regreening is a mandatory target.

00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:53.420
Xinhai is answering the call.

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:55.070
They must do it regardless of the cost.

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:57.200
"Regardless of cost" is just a slogan.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.160
The Xinhai bosses

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.620
aren't philanthropists.

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:01.220
You should know
the operating costs of coal mines

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:02.540
better than I do.

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:04.160
Money flows out like water

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:05.180
every single day.

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:06.670
Would you do it?

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.530
What do you mean by that?

00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:13.280
How much outcrop coal is there?

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:14.710
Can it cover

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:15.990
the regreening costs?

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:18.470
If funds aren't enough,

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:19.480
is it possible

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:21.360
that they...

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:22.840
What are you trying to say?

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:25.440
Is it possible that they're engaged in

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.370
illegal mining?

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:33.610
You're something else.

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:35.220
You really are.

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:36.870
You shouldn't be a reporter.

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:38.270
You should write novels.

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:40.850
You're getting better and better
at telling stories.

00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:41.910
I just feel like this whole thing

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:43.040
doesn't make sense.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.220
I'm just a shallow guy.

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:45.370
I put money first.

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:46.650
You probably think this

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:47.240
sounds

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:48.110
so ridiculous,

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:49.640
like I'm talking nonsense.

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:50.250
That's because

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:51.390
you have principles

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:52.370
and a bottom line at work.

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:53.040
But that doesn't mean

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:53.750
everyone at Xinhai

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:54.570
is like you.

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:56.950
I don't mean anything else.

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.980
I just want to give you a heads-up.

00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:00.930
Don't get dragged into this.

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:05.200
I've worked in the mines

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.250
for over 10 years.

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:08.580
I've heard of mining beyond boundaries.

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:10.610
I've heard of destructive mining too.

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:12.180
But I've never even heard

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:13.290
of illegal mining.

00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:19.300
Alright.

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:22.140
Well,

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.270
if you think everything is fine,

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:25.130
then just forget I said anything.

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:33.320
What time do you start work tomorrow?

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:38.990
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.700
Don't you want to chat?

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.570
You type really slow.

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:49.580
I was hoping

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:51.110
to video chat with you.

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:52.460
But now I can't even

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:53.410
hear your voice.

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.020
You know what chatting like this

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:01.180
reminds me of?

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:02.560
Streamers.

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:04.550
Streamers?

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:07.040
Do you watch livestreams too?

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:09.260
I saw a livestreaming app

00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:10.830
on your phone last time.

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:13.050
I knew you liked watching them.

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:15.770
Alright.

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:17.220
Stop talking.

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.280
Your workers will beat you up later.

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:21.120
If you're free after work tomorrow,

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.650
I'll pick you up for dinner.

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.240
Why are you up so late,

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:26.240
talking and laughing?

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:27.300
What are you doing?

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:28.850
Mom.

00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:30.370
It's the middle of the night.

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:31.970
Who are you on the phone with?

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:33.710
A friend.

00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:35.560
A man or a woman?

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:37.640
A man.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.460
He's in Guangzhou?

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:42.370
Since he's in Guangzhou,

00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:44.230
you asked him to dinner tomorrow?

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:49.890
Tell him

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:52.620
to set a time to come here for dinner.

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:56.250
Turn off your phone.

00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:56.950
Go to sleep.

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:10.090
Did you hear all that just now?

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:12.580
My mom wants you to come over for dinner.

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:14.030
Han.

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:16.280
Chives and egg.

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:18.010
I remember that one time

00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:18.820
I made this filling,

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:19.800
and you really liked it.

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:20.460
Yes, yes.

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:22.980
Times were tough back then,

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:24.510
so I only used one egg.

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:26.650
Today I used 3 eggs.

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:28.830
Thank you. Thank you, Director Zhang.

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.140
Oh, you.

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:33.950
You used to

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:35.440
come to my house every day.

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:36.940
But you didn't visit me

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:38.310
all these years.

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:42.360
So much happened back then.

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.500
I was too embarrassed to come.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:45.820
Don't say that.

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:47.120
Zhacuo still sends me

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:47.820
yak jerky

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:49.250
from time to time.

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:50.030
Back then,

00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:50.800
when Sangba was in the county town,

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.060
we still kept in touch.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:52.760
Once,

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:54.000
I took a research team

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:54.750
to the conservation station,

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:56.480
and he was the one who hosted us.

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:57.420
You just don't consider me

00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:58.400
family,

00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:00.480
always calling me "Director Zhang."

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:04.930
Tastes good.

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:07.290
Tastes just the same.

00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:08.920
I added 3 eggs.

00:34:08.969 --> 00:34:10.500
How could it taste the same?

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:12.110
It's even better.

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:16.610
Bai Ju told me about your situation

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:18.420
a few times over the years.

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:22.080
You've always been like this,

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.679
keeping everything inside.

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:27.020
It's good in a way, but also bad.

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:28.540
Good for others,

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.239
but bad for yourself.

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:33.670
One time,

00:34:33.699 --> 00:34:34.909
Bai Ju arrested you.

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:37.040
You said something to her.

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:38.830
She came back and told me.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.040
I felt bad for a long time.

00:34:43.449 --> 00:34:44.260
You said,

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:47.679
"Now that the Mountain Patrol is gone,

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:49.710
no one looks after you."

00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:58.030
You still have me.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:03.690
From now on,

00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:06.460
I'll look after you.

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:16.320
Thank you.

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:19.570
Thank you, Auntie Zhang.

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:23.230
Alright.

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:24.960
He's here to eat.

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:26.900
Yes, yes.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:27.840
Yes.

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:29.740
Enough talk. Enough talk.

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:30.490
Let's eat.

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:32.960
Eat more, Han.

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:33.630
Here.

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:42.440
By the way, Han.

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.960
Do you have something to say?

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:46.970
Why did you decide

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:48.280
to visit me today?

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:14.450
Please show me

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:15.600
your Mine No. 2 pass.

00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:17.270
Here.

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:20.910
Manager Bai, what brings you here?

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:22.140
Lift the bar.

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:22.830
Manager Bai,

00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:23.690
you can't go in.

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:25.530
The mining area has rules.

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:26.550
Vehicles and personnel

00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:27.280
without the blue pass for Mine No. 2

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.000
are not allowed

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:28.930
to enter.

00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:32.200
Don't you know who I am?

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:33.360
Manager Bai,

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:33.940
who in Xinhai

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:35.280
doesn't know you?

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:36.470
Then let me through.

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:39.570
Look,

00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:40.320
they just installed

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.650
this camera yesterday.

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.380
If I let you in against the rules,

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:44.510
I'll get fined.

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:46.560
Please don't make this hard for me.

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:47.670
Why don't you

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:48.860
call Mr. Meng

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.290
and ask for permission?

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:54.020
Manager Bai.

00:36:56.830 --> 00:36:57.440
Forget it.

00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:04.690
Let me see your pass.

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:15.210
Bai Chun,

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:16.440
your Mine No. 1

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.100
has been pretty quiet lately.

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:19.440
How do you have time

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:20.660
to come to Mine No. 2?

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:24.150
Mr. Meng.

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:26.400
At Mine No. 1,

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.130
during the slope maintenance,

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:29.410
the daily amount

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:31.090
of residual and outcrop coal cleared out

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:31.570
is only enough

00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:32.970
for one transport shift.

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:34.730
But I heard

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:36.920
the transport team at Mine No. 2

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:38.570
is not only working 3 shifts

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:40.170
but has also increased their trips.

00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:40.770
So I wanted

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:41.980
to go into Mine No. 2

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:43.530
and learn a thing or two.

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:47.230
Bai Chun,

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:50.130
you've really matured.

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:53.480
You've learned to talk in circles.

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.620
Then I'll be straight with you.

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:56.550
Things aren't like they used to be.

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:57.820
Sloppy work

00:37:57.930 --> 00:37:59.120
and failing dust control standards

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:00.350
are minor details.

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:02.010
Problems can be fixed.

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:04.050
But with the mining ban in effect,

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:05.590
digging even one more shovel

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:06.510
is illegal mining.

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:08.110
You'll go to prison for that.

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:10.240
Coal can't speak for itself.

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:12.460
It won't tell you

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:13.990
which piece is outcrop coal

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.030
and which piece

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:16.490
is freshly mined raw coal.

00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:19.090
After washing, dewatering,

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:20.290
drying, and grading,

00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:21.690
once it's shipped out,

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:23.220
they all have just one name:

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.400
commercial coal.

00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:29.100
Am I right, Manager Bai?

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:31.990
I see.

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:16.140
Who built this bench road?

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:18.310
The height is over the limit,

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:19.710
and it's not wide enough.

00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:21.300
These are safety hazards.

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:22.850
And that working face over there,

00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:23.630
2 months ago,

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:25.450
it was already mined to the edge.

00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:26.510
But now stripping operations

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:27.570
are still ongoing.

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:29.000
This must be a violation.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.330
It's definitely not mining outcrop coal.

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:33.590
So, do you want

00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:35.690
to take pictures of them?

00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:38.620
Take pictures

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:40.910
and send them to Shao Yunfei

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:43.030
to expose Xinhai for using

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:44.500
outcrop mining as a cover

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:45.670
for illegal mining.

00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:53.590
That would be
the absolute right thing to do.

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:54.810
And I won't stop you.

00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:00.020
But Bai Chun,

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.330
there are two sides to everything.

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:04.570
This is the side

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:05.800
we can all see.

00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:08.640
But what about the other side?

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:12.940
What do you mean?

00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:16.510
Them.

00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:20.010
Their lives

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:22.080
will never be seen.

00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:26.980
Yu, Liu,

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:28.240
they're down there.

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:29.190
And many other brothers

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:30.360
who worked with you

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:31.340
in Mine No. 1.

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:34.850
You should know them better than I do.

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:39.040
Coal mining is a high-risk industry,

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:40.530
but why do they

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:42.530
insist on working on the front line?

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:43.610
Yes.

00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:45.860
Mine No. 2 has safety issues.

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:47.070
Since you can notice,

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:48.190
can't they?

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.490
But why does no one speak up?

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:52.710
Why do they continue

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:53.830
to work overtime?

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:55.760
It's not necessarily true

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:56.510
that they can only stay

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:57.550
in this one place.

00:40:57.650 --> 00:40:58.210
The regreening project

00:40:58.210 --> 00:40:59.280
can absorb some of them.

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:01.130
But compared to mining,

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:03.290
does regreening pay the same?

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:07.400
Neither you nor I can bear

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.140
the impact of shutting down production.

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:10.620
They and their families

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:11.940
can bear it even less.

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:15.300
Take your brother as an example.

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:16.480
He can switch to the regreening business

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:16.860
because

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:18.320
he still has some capital.

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.450
But what about them?

00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:22.580
If they had any choice,

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:24.590
who would want to do this?

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:30.890
I'm also just

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:32.090
working for the boss.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.170
In my position,

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:36.210
being responsible to the boss,

00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:38.250
making money for him,
and keeping him satisfied

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:39.230
are fine.

00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:42.340
But I can also

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:44.800
think a little more

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:46.280
about the people under me.

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:25.400
When mining outcrop coal,

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:29.420
we still need to pay attention to safety.

00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:36.910
Don't worry.

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:39.620
I'll handle these issues.

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:43.260
You just focus on the regreening project.

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:54.970
Hello, Mr. Meng.

00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:56.210
Hello, Mr. Meng.

00:42:57.070 --> 00:42:57.940
Hello, Mr. Meng.

00:42:57.940 --> 00:42:58.480
Hello, Mr. Meng.

00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.100
Hello, Mr. Meng.
