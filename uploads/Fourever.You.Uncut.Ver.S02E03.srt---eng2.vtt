WEBVTT

00:00:09.118 --> 00:00:10.780
Oh, it’s Tonfah?

00:00:11.063 --> 00:00:14.008
Yes. I study here, and I happened to run into Phoon.

00:00:14.216 --> 00:00:16.400
Did Phoon mention Fun at all?

00:00:16.684 --> 00:00:17.927
Didn’t I already tell you?

00:00:18.281 --> 00:00:20.293
You can study wherever you want,

00:00:20.474 --> 00:00:22.028
but don’t get involved with Tonfah again.

00:00:22.154 --> 00:00:23.688
Is he hiding something from you?

00:00:24.182 --> 00:00:25.040
Maybe.

00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:28.908
I don’t know… it’s like if I make even the slightest wrong move,

00:00:29.204 --> 00:00:30.560
I’ll lose him forever.

00:00:30.706 --> 00:00:33.482
Are you sure he’s just your brother?

00:00:33.831 --> 00:00:35.872
Phoon is P’Fah’s important little brother.

00:00:36.288 --> 00:00:39.634
Do you even realize how damn annoying you are, P’Fah?

00:00:43.902 --> 00:00:45.693
To Thorfun.

00:00:52.632 --> 00:00:53.934
In the end,

00:00:54.736 --> 00:00:57.448
Phoon chose to hurt the person I loved the most,

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.397
to protect someone else I loved.

00:01:01.174 --> 00:01:03.223
Now there’s no P’Fah anymore.

00:01:03.882 --> 00:01:06.268
I hope Dad will love me a little more.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.435
P’Fah asked if I hate him now.

00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:14.444
No way. Even if I died, I’d still love P’Fah.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.358
The person I hate the most in the world

00:01:18.014 --> 00:01:19.306
is myself.

00:01:21.057 --> 00:01:24.139
A world without Fun and P’Fah feels so hard to live in.

00:01:28.242 --> 00:01:30.210
But I already promised Fun.

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:36.453
So I’ll try to live well. Please pray for me, Fun.

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:54.585
Freshman?

00:01:54.946 --> 00:01:56.432
Yeah, freshman.

00:01:56.934 --> 00:01:58.106
Do we need to sign our names?

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.499
They told us to register here.

00:02:03.404 --> 00:02:05.398
Uh… I’m Easter.

00:02:05.672 --> 00:02:07.008
I’m Typhoon.

00:02:10.481 --> 00:02:11.413
I’ll treat.

00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:13.365
Why?
Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.054
Because you waited for me earlier.

00:02:16.373 --> 00:02:17.709
It’s really okay, though.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.915
- Try it.
- So who are we waiting for?

00:02:22.428 --> 00:02:23.558
My roommate.

00:02:25.121 --> 00:02:26.505
Where the hell is he?

00:02:27.706 --> 00:02:28.693
Why isn’t he here yet?

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:50.474
Man, speak of the devil. Hurry up.

00:02:59.367 --> 00:03:00.157
Phoon.

00:03:00.894 --> 00:03:02.605
This is my roommate, North.

00:03:03.617 --> 00:03:06.091
***North—this is Phoon, my friend.

00:03:06.167 --> 00:03:07.771
Wow, so I’m “***North” now?

00:03:07.897 --> 00:03:09.293
Yeah, suits you perfectly.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.854
- Did you order mine not sweet?
- I did.

00:03:12.682 --> 00:03:14.607
I ordered it extra sweet.

00:03:15.471 --> 00:03:16.600
I don’t like it.

00:03:17.143 --> 00:03:17.970
Well, I do.

00:03:18.165 --> 00:03:20.496
- If you like it, eat it yourself.
- Fine, but you’re paying.

00:03:21.354 --> 00:03:22.102
Again?

00:03:22.185 --> 00:03:24.103
Phoon, don’t go hanging out with people like this.

00:03:24.875 --> 00:03:27.168
I’m North, first-year electrical engineering.

00:03:27.445 --> 00:03:29.804
I’m Typhoon, first-year veterinary.

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:33.031
- Where are you from?
- Phuket.

00:03:33.228 --> 00:03:35.432
Seriously?

00:03:35.631 --> 00:03:39.013
Can you speak Southern Thai?

00:03:39.484 --> 00:03:41.346
- I can’t.
- Oh, you can’t?

00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:43.374
- What about you, North?
- I’m from Lampang.

00:03:43.554 --> 00:03:48.245
But I’m not very good at it yet. I still need to learn.
I’ll teach you later, okay?

00:03:49.078 --> 00:03:49.866
Got it?

00:03:49.934 --> 00:03:51.854
Translate it. Put subtitles up now.

00:03:52.008 --> 00:03:53.456
Make them big. I’m confused.

00:03:56.211 --> 00:03:58.077
Au means speaking. Bo-chang means you're not good at it.

00:03:58.336 --> 00:04:01.112
Life in university isn’t as bad as I thought.

00:04:01.634 --> 00:04:03.377
I think I'm doing pretty well.

00:04:04.733 --> 00:04:06.291
Fun, you don’t have to worry.

00:04:09.691 --> 00:04:11.506
I met really good friends.

00:04:12.035 --> 00:04:13.712
So good that I wonder

00:04:13.997 --> 00:04:15.506
if someone like me really deserves them.

00:04:18.485 --> 00:04:21.074
Didn’t you say turn left? I followed you!

00:04:21.327 --> 00:04:23.031
Well, that is left.

00:04:23.752 --> 00:04:24.682
That’s right.

00:04:24.928 --> 00:04:28.111
But sometimes fate likes to play tricks.

00:04:28.395 --> 00:04:29.333
Sorry.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:30.832
Whatever.

00:04:31.518 --> 00:04:34.010
Ter said someone would come pick us up, right?

00:04:34.342 --> 00:04:35.328
So we’ll—

00:04:36.982 --> 00:04:40.583
- Let’s wait around here.
- Because no matter how far I get lost,

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.573
You’re Ter’s friend, right?

00:04:51.471 --> 00:04:53.619
P’Fah will always find me.

00:05:06.303 --> 00:05:07.550
P’Hill.

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:08.198
Snacks.

00:05:09.096 --> 00:05:11.629
- Hi, Easter.
- Hi.

00:05:13.431 --> 00:05:14.594
Here’s a sandwich.

00:05:21.505 --> 00:05:23.022
- Want some?
- Yeah, sure.

00:07:03.216 --> 00:07:05.694
That’s it for today. You can all go home.

00:07:06.549 --> 00:07:08.626
Yay! Let’s go!

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:11.826
Hey.

00:07:12.703 --> 00:07:14.017
Let’s go reading today.

00:07:14.604 --> 00:07:15.637
So diligent.

00:07:15.899 --> 00:07:17.648
Of course.

00:07:18.005 --> 00:07:21.539
P'Mhor are always studying, and I also want to see P’Hill.

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:26.312
That’s called wanting to see your boyfriend, not studying.
Don’t make excuses.

00:07:28.854 --> 00:07:33.481
Here, Phoon. You want to take the med exam, right?
Got P'Mhor to tutor you.

00:07:33.642 --> 00:07:35.139
Come on, please.

00:07:35.915 --> 00:07:38.582
Even though deep down I don’t want you to pass.

00:07:39.595 --> 00:07:41.525
Look at him, cursing his own friend.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:42.961
Hey, I’m not cursing anyone.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.888
What, you want me to stay alone with you in the faculty or something?

00:07:44.899 --> 00:07:48.230
- What’s wrong with being with me?
- See? This is exactly what happens when I’m with you.

00:07:48.918 --> 00:07:50.717
Phoon, look at your friend.

00:07:52.644 --> 00:07:54.120
I'm gonna miss you.

00:07:54.638 --> 00:07:55.773
Come on, let’s go.

00:07:56.792 --> 00:07:57.297
Mm.

00:07:57.487 --> 00:07:59.640
Ugh, you’re overthinking it like it’s an exam. Let’s go.

00:08:00.087 --> 00:08:04.008
- Fine, I’ll go too.
- That’s right, Foam. If Phoon’s going, you have to go too.

00:08:05.038 --> 00:08:06.911
I can’t. I’ve got plans today.

00:08:07.383 --> 00:08:08.139
With who?

00:08:08.398 --> 00:08:10.108
I’m allowed to have plans sometimes, you know.

00:08:10.167 --> 00:08:12.111
You’ve got plans every day.

00:08:12.337 --> 00:08:15.733
Just remember this—let your girlfriend help you during exams then.

00:08:15.797 --> 00:08:16.939
Ugh, stop nagging.

00:08:17.765 --> 00:08:19.829
Hurry up, Phoon.

00:08:20.401 --> 00:08:21.693
Our gang only has two people now.

00:08:45.229 --> 00:08:46.745
Huh? Where’s everyone else?

00:08:48.333 --> 00:08:50.211
Probably buying snacks.

00:08:50.819 --> 00:08:53.216
- They’re on their way.
- Oh.

00:09:01.851 --> 00:09:03.257
You sleep your life away.

00:09:03.351 --> 00:09:04.681
And eating my space too.

00:09:09.419 --> 00:09:10.768
That’s just how it is.

00:09:14.884 --> 00:09:16.506
Maybe… this is for the best.

00:09:29.848 --> 00:09:31.334
Auntie Nuan.

00:09:38.503 --> 00:09:39.774
Yes, Auntie Nuan.

00:09:39.909 --> 00:09:41.863
How have you been, Phoon?

00:09:42.669 --> 00:09:43.754
I’m doing well.

00:09:44.112 --> 00:09:45.669
And you, Auntie Nuan?

00:09:45.884 --> 00:09:49.859
I’m fine. Why haven’t you contacted me at all?

00:09:50.137 --> 00:09:54.229
I’m sorry, Auntie. I’ve been really busy lately.

00:09:54.659 --> 00:09:58.260
Phoon, have you heard? The house has been sold.

00:10:00.623 --> 00:10:02.762
- Really?
- Yes.

00:10:03.084 --> 00:10:06.539
Today the Mister asked me to come pack things up for the last time.

00:10:06.761 --> 00:10:10.514
There are still some of your things left, Phoon. I just couldn’t bring myself to throw them away.

00:10:11.044 --> 00:10:12.891
Will you come back to the house?

00:10:17.542 --> 00:10:18.285
Yes.

00:10:19.045 --> 00:10:20.998
I still have some free days next week.

00:10:21.317 --> 00:10:24.653
Alright then. Call me when you arrive.

00:10:24.902 --> 00:10:26.189
I’ll be waiting.

00:10:26.705 --> 00:10:27.610
Okay.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.111
Fun.

00:10:42.164 --> 00:10:44.351
Another piece of proof of the memories we shared…

00:10:45.082 --> 00:10:46.844
is about to disappear.

00:11:11.494 --> 00:11:14.047
So what will you do next, Auntie Nuan?

00:11:14.194 --> 00:11:16.437
I’ll probably go back home and take care of my grandchild.

00:11:17.042 --> 00:11:18.471
I’m getting old already.

00:11:19.051 --> 00:11:21.328
I don’t think I’ll look for another job.

00:11:22.084 --> 00:11:24.974
That’s good. You’ll finally get some rest.

00:11:25.514 --> 00:11:28.688
You raised me and Fun for so many years.

00:11:31.002 --> 00:11:34.401
Shall we go see Fun first?

00:11:34.835 --> 00:11:35.503
Yes.

00:11:48.278 --> 00:11:49.429
Auntie Nuan…

00:11:50.524 --> 00:11:53.986
Is it possible… that Fun is still here?

00:11:55.875 --> 00:11:56.957
Phoon…

00:11:57.927 --> 00:12:00.077
I don’t want to say this, but—

00:12:01.017 --> 00:12:01.859
still…

00:12:02.171 --> 00:12:05.493
those who have passed on are gone.

00:12:06.842 --> 00:12:10.524
If you keep holding on, it will only hurt more.

00:12:13.711 --> 00:12:17.425
Fun wouldn’t want you to be in pain either.

00:12:31.654 --> 00:12:32.814
Fun…

00:12:33.805 --> 00:12:35.500
Auntie misses you.

00:12:52.296 --> 00:12:53.665
I'm back.

00:12:56.213 --> 00:12:57.287
Did you miss me?

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.133
I’m sorry that I…

00:13:00.491 --> 00:13:02.608
couldn’t come see you every day like before.

00:13:05.414 --> 00:13:06.672
You must’ve been so lonely.

00:13:13.545 --> 00:13:15.066
I dream about you too, Fun.

00:13:16.114 --> 00:13:18.925
In my dreams, it feels so real…

00:13:20.042 --> 00:13:21.853
sometimes I think…

00:13:23.032 --> 00:13:24.771
you’ll really come see me.

00:13:29.494 --> 00:13:31.001
I’m sorry for being selfish.

00:13:33.391 --> 00:13:34.709
Would you be mad at me, Fun,

00:13:35.271 --> 00:13:36.954
if I wished you could stay?

00:13:40.192 --> 00:13:41.638
I don’t want you to go anywhere at all.

00:14:20.198 --> 00:14:22.339
These are all that’s left of Fun’s things.

00:14:22.642 --> 00:14:23.942
What should we do?

00:14:28.733 --> 00:14:30.318
Can we donate them?

00:14:31.111 --> 00:14:32.265
Would that be okay?

00:14:32.903 --> 00:14:34.124
I think…

00:14:34.911 --> 00:14:37.702
Fun would want them to be useful to others.

00:14:39.871 --> 00:14:42.167
I’m not sure if I should say this,

00:14:43.105 --> 00:14:44.592
but there’s something

00:14:45.204 --> 00:14:46.992
I want you to know.

00:14:48.694 --> 00:14:49.840
What is it?

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:53.751
Fun knew from the very beginning

00:14:54.062 --> 00:14:56.776
that you weren’t the biological child of this family.

00:15:00.727 --> 00:15:01.647
Really?

00:15:04.038 --> 00:15:09.560
That night, Fun and I overheard Miss and Mister arguing.

00:15:11.545 --> 00:15:15.662
I was afraid Fun might not take it well,

00:15:17.134 --> 00:15:18.595
but it turned out that…

00:15:19.158 --> 00:15:20.440
Fun…

00:15:20.835 --> 00:15:22.878
still loved you just the same.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.567
But after Fun passed away,

00:15:29.054 --> 00:15:31.133
everything started to fall apart.

00:15:32.037 --> 00:15:34.940
I didn’t know what to do either.

00:15:38.205 --> 00:15:41.444
Phoon, you’re not the one who destroyed this family.

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:45.120
Fun never thought that way.

00:15:47.521 --> 00:15:49.296
Please don’t blame yourself.

00:15:56.451 --> 00:15:57.531
Thank you.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:46.278
The truth I wanted you to come see… is all of this.

00:16:47.293 --> 00:16:49.958
Mister wanted me to throw these away.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.623
But I secretly kept them.

00:16:54.927 --> 00:16:56.237
What are they?

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:03.348
They’ve been sent since you were one year old, Phoon.

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:05.631
Every year.

00:17:06.087 --> 00:17:07.524
Around March.

00:17:08.647 --> 00:17:10.247
Your birth month.

00:17:11.927 --> 00:17:14.303
There’s no sender’s name, but…

00:17:14.774 --> 00:17:15.927
there is a recipient’s name.

00:17:20.613 --> 00:17:21.570
My mom?

00:17:24.757 --> 00:17:28.740
Miss threw away many of them already.

00:17:29.047 --> 00:17:32.588
This is all I could secretly keep.

00:17:38.548 --> 00:17:39.656
It’s okay.

00:17:40.398 --> 00:17:41.600
This is already enough.

00:17:42.814 --> 00:17:44.280
Thank you, Auntie Nuan.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.102
I hope things are the way you think they are.

00:17:52.074 --> 00:17:55.484
At least your real mother still thinks of you.

00:17:56.508 --> 00:17:59.742
But she must have had some reason…

00:18:00.023 --> 00:18:02.002
that kept her from coming to see you.

00:18:06.028 --> 00:18:06.897
Yes.

00:18:07.739 --> 00:18:09.456
I hope she had a reason.

00:18:10.574 --> 00:18:12.100
Any reason at all.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:14.640
As long as it wasn’t because she didn’t love me.

00:19:06.573 --> 00:19:08.920
Back from Phuket yet?

00:19:08.937 --> 00:19:10.691
Yeah, just got back to my room.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.300
We’re having a dinner party.

00:19:13.328 --> 00:19:14.850
What’s the occasion?

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.423
The occasion is that we feel like eating.

00:19:19.124 --> 00:19:21.078
Who’s going?

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:24.266
Me, North, P’Hill, and P’Hill’s friends.

00:19:28.164 --> 00:19:29.343
P’Hill’s friends?

00:19:29.724 --> 00:19:32.422
Yeah, lots of people. It’ll be fun.

00:19:38.481 --> 00:19:39.242
But…

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.722
Alright, I’ll go.

00:19:46.216 --> 00:19:47.970
Cool. I’ll pick you up.

00:19:48.666 --> 00:19:50.001
Mm, okay.

00:19:58.731 --> 00:20:00.145
So are you going or not?

00:20:00.777 --> 00:20:02.056
I think I won’t go.

00:20:02.597 --> 00:20:03.694
Because of Phoon?

00:20:06.188 --> 00:20:07.152
Yeah.

00:20:08.042 --> 00:20:10.020
He’d probably feel more comfortable if I didn’t go.

00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:13.844
You should talk it out already. It’s awkward.

00:20:14.682 --> 00:20:16.330
Does he even want to talk to me?

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:21.668
He can’t even look at my face.

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:27.595
Okay, I’ll stop. You get like this every time Phoon comes up.

00:20:27.877 --> 00:20:29.764
I’ll tell them you’re busy.

00:20:30.269 --> 00:20:31.137
Mm.

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:45.871
P’Fah, look. The sky’s so beautiful today.

00:20:46.625 --> 00:20:48.311
Even though it rained so hard last night.

00:20:49.573 --> 00:20:53.198
It’s nice that the sky can make you smile this much.

00:21:15.231 --> 00:21:15.960
Hey!

00:21:16.694 --> 00:21:17.934
So where the hell did Fah go?

00:21:18.262 --> 00:21:19.216
He’s busy.

00:21:19.545 --> 00:21:20.688
What do you mean, busy?

00:21:21.007 --> 00:21:23.743
Why are you asking so many questions? Busy means busy.

00:21:23.754 --> 00:21:25.118
You’re annoying as hell.

00:21:25.238 --> 00:21:27.231
Damn it, Jo, I only said two sentences.

00:21:27.574 --> 00:21:29.271
- Asshole.
- Asshole?

00:21:29.414 --> 00:21:30.515
What kind of asshole?

00:21:31.085 --> 00:21:32.269
Hill, look at him picking on me.

00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:40.001
Hey, didn’t you say you were busy?

00:21:48.441 --> 00:21:50.875
The more I think about it, the more I feel like being free is better.

00:21:52.619 --> 00:21:53.952
What do you mean, “being free is better”?

00:21:56.946 --> 00:22:00.198
Arthit, I want to sit here.

00:22:02.797 --> 00:22:05.951
The hell’s wrong with you? There’s tons of space—go sit somewhere else.

00:22:06.041 --> 00:22:08.090
Go sit next to Jo. Your fling.

00:22:09.151 --> 00:22:10.179
Jo? My fling?

00:22:10.311 --> 00:22:11.016
Yeah.

00:22:11.804 --> 00:22:12.724
This asshole?

00:22:12.909 --> 00:22:14.408
Come on, hurry up.

00:22:15.949 --> 00:22:17.397
I’m doing this just for you.

00:22:18.431 --> 00:22:19.685
I don’t even want to sit there.

00:22:20.234 --> 00:22:21.200
Next to that poser.

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:30.354
Want to move to another table?

00:22:35.124 --> 00:22:36.042
Hey.

00:22:37.656 --> 00:22:39.100
Long time no see.

00:22:45.059 --> 00:22:45.811
Yeah.

00:22:58.223 --> 00:22:59.456
Phoon, want some shrimp?

00:23:00.801 --> 00:23:02.007
- Huh?
- Careful, it’s dripping.

00:23:02.395 --> 00:23:03.752
Looks damn good. Share some with me.

00:23:03.841 --> 00:23:05.118
- Share what?
- The shrimp.

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:07.112
- What shrimp?
- The one you’re peeling right now.

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.654
If you want shrimp, order your own.

00:23:08.684 --> 00:23:10.647
Wow, North, you’ve got some nerve.

00:23:10.758 --> 00:23:12.967
I never once complained about you eating my stuff from the fridge.

00:23:13.179 --> 00:23:14.634
- Stuff from the fridge?
- Yeah.

00:23:15.653 --> 00:23:18.417
Weren’t you buying it to share?

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:20.478
To share?

00:23:20.841 --> 00:23:21.788
- Share with you?
- Yeah.

00:23:21.804 --> 00:23:24.561
- You’re the one stealing.
- Then just tell me next time.

00:23:24.625 --> 00:23:26.389
Basic manners say you should ask first.

00:23:26.602 --> 00:23:27.922
Since when do I have manners?

00:23:27.992 --> 00:23:29.357
- You don’t.
- Exactly.

00:23:29.379 --> 00:23:30.845
- Give it to me.
- Don’t eat it.

00:23:31.008 --> 00:23:32.487
Two pieces. Peel them too.

00:23:33.508 --> 00:23:34.280
Always me.

00:23:34.542 --> 00:23:35.641
Good job.

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:39.342
Hey, peel it properly.

00:23:45.902 --> 00:23:47.309
Shrimp. It’s shrimp. Keep it neat.

00:23:49.903 --> 00:23:50.936
Thank you.

00:24:06.462 --> 00:24:09.503
Hey, why are they taking so long to pay?

00:24:09.804 --> 00:24:10.705
Yeah, seriously.

00:24:11.822 --> 00:24:15.266
Or are P'Mhor arguing over who should pay?

00:24:16.309 --> 00:24:18.509
One thing’s for sure—P’Arthit won’t be one of them.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:23.927
Phoon.

00:24:24.219 --> 00:24:24.654
Hm?

00:24:26.765 --> 00:24:29.136
I’ve got something I want to ask you.

00:24:32.571 --> 00:24:35.438
Jeez, you’re stalling again. When are you gonna ask?

00:24:35.546 --> 00:24:36.536
I’ll ask.

00:24:36.739 --> 00:24:38.309
- So what’s going on between you and P’Fah?
- Huh?

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:41.986
Damn it, North. You really don’t beat around the bush.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.768
Who would even know how to answer that?

00:24:43.982 --> 00:24:45.434
You keep going “uh… uh…” like that.

00:24:48.442 --> 00:24:51.026
It’s a long story.

00:24:51.285 --> 00:24:52.905
Are you guys ready to hear it?

00:24:53.259 --> 00:24:55.271
Ready. Totally ready.

00:24:56.288 --> 00:24:57.734
Yeah, go on.

00:25:01.946 --> 00:25:02.829
So…

00:25:04.718 --> 00:25:05.868
So?

00:25:06.368 --> 00:25:08.518
Me and P’Fah…

00:25:08.663 --> 00:25:10.222
Yeah? What about it?

00:25:11.122 --> 00:25:12.232
What are you guys talking about?

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:15.040
Oh—nothing, P’Hill.

00:25:15.238 --> 00:25:16.505
I’m so full. Let’s head back.

00:25:16.577 --> 00:25:18.488
Bye, P’. Bye.

00:25:18.574 --> 00:25:19.998
Bye, P’Hill.

00:25:20.259 --> 00:25:21.491
See you.

00:25:22.474 --> 00:25:23.998
What were you guys talking about?

00:25:25.231 --> 00:25:28.068
Hmm… top-level secret.

00:25:28.485 --> 00:25:29.949
If you want to know, transfer some money first.

00:25:31.211 --> 00:25:32.121
Go get it at home.

00:25:35.789 --> 00:25:37.002
I’m heading off.

00:25:37.034 --> 00:25:38.324
P'Jo, have you transferred yet?

00:25:38.368 --> 00:25:40.754
- I’m coming with you, Jo.
- Why are you coming?

00:26:29.115 --> 00:26:30.539
Dao? How did you get here?

00:26:30.586 --> 00:26:32.991
Ta-da!

00:26:33.226 --> 00:26:34.302
I called him myself.

00:26:34.619 --> 00:26:39.717
I felt like the problem you’re dealing with is too big for just me and North to handle alone.

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:43.287
Don’t tell me everyone showing up this morning—

00:26:43.783 --> 00:26:45.703
was because of me and P’Fah?

00:26:45.832 --> 00:26:46.802
Yeah.

00:26:48.506 --> 00:26:50.376
So how long are you gonna make me wait? Come inside.

00:26:51.377 --> 00:26:53.946
- Fine.
- Go on in, Dao. Don’t be shy.

00:26:54.656 --> 00:26:55.988
Hey, aren’t you gonna grab some snacks?

00:26:57.099 --> 00:26:58.285
Come on, I’m starving.

00:26:59.256 --> 00:27:01.127
Alright, you guys. Start talking.

00:27:01.268 --> 00:27:03.819
Today, no need to wait for Foam. He chose sleep.

00:27:04.054 --> 00:27:06.970
Think about it—between friends and sleep, he chose sleep.

00:27:07.186 --> 00:27:09.822
And you? Between friends and food, what do you choose?

00:27:10.128 --> 00:27:13.395
- I choose 'between'
- Choose what? Be clear.

00:27:13.955 --> 00:27:14.770
I choose everything.

00:27:16.531 --> 00:27:17.871
I’ll give you one more chance.

00:27:18.342 --> 00:27:20.395
Fine—eating with friends.

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:22.717
You’re such a glutton.

00:27:22.764 --> 00:27:24.103
Come on, North.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:26.645
Aren’t you gonna eat?

00:27:31.555 --> 00:27:33.271
Alright, let’s do this.

00:27:35.115 --> 00:27:36.971
The reason we’re all here today—

00:27:37.071 --> 00:27:37.880
Mm.

00:27:38.405 --> 00:27:39.435
So what is it, exactly?

00:27:42.071 --> 00:27:43.041
It’s about me.

00:27:46.517 --> 00:27:49.900
Yeah, I know it’s about you—but can you actually tell us?

00:27:50.598 --> 00:27:51.754
It’s about me.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.592
My story.

00:27:54.807 --> 00:27:56.685
Fine, then. I won’t pry.

00:27:58.205 --> 00:28:00.216
I just don’t know how to explain it—like—

00:28:00.437 --> 00:28:01.668
Relax, Maew. Just kidding.

00:28:02.266 --> 00:28:03.225
So what is it?

00:28:04.217 --> 00:28:05.179
Can you tell us?

00:28:06.075 --> 00:28:07.016
Is it a secret?

00:28:09.465 --> 00:28:10.604
A big secret?

00:28:11.755 --> 00:28:13.192
A really big one.

00:28:14.014 --> 00:28:15.674
I don’t want anyone to know.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.162
Especially...

00:28:17.804 --> 00:28:18.749
P'Mhor.

00:28:23.105 --> 00:28:24.315
But I have one request.

00:28:24.951 --> 00:28:26.065
After I tell you—

00:28:26.894 --> 00:28:28.638
don’t hate me, okay?

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.151
We don’t hate you.

00:28:32.696 --> 00:28:34.943
Even if you will scratch us, we won’t hate it.

00:28:36.114 --> 00:28:37.659
You said it yourself—remember that.

00:28:37.882 --> 00:28:39.260
In case one day you feel like scratching us.

00:28:39.914 --> 00:28:42.260
Yeah, no one’s gonna hate you.

00:28:43.481 --> 00:28:45.591
- You can relax.
- Then—

00:28:46.567 --> 00:28:49.044
- Start talking.
- Yeah, go on.

00:29:14.971 --> 00:29:17.960
So that’s why you like taking pictures of the sky, right?

00:29:21.317 --> 00:29:22.826
Because you like P’Fah.

00:29:24.794 --> 00:29:26.678
Honestly, after hearing everything—

00:29:27.117 --> 00:29:31.506
what the hell is wrong with your dad?

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.186
It makes me so mad just listening to it.

00:29:36.602 --> 00:29:38.475
Thanks for getting angry on my behalf.

00:29:38.736 --> 00:29:40.531
Yeah… not everyone

00:29:41.191 --> 00:29:42.882
is ready to be a parent.

00:29:43.564 --> 00:29:44.491
But still—

00:29:44.961 --> 00:29:46.805
he’s already my dad.

00:29:47.997 --> 00:29:50.543
And he’s the only one I have left.

00:29:52.561 --> 00:29:55.331
Yeah… you’re really strong.

00:29:56.985 --> 00:29:58.792
- Me?
- Yeah.

00:29:59.219 --> 00:30:01.306
After all that, you can still smile.

00:30:01.811 --> 00:30:03.158
You’re seriously amazing.

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:06.545
Ah.

00:30:07.026 --> 00:30:10.259
Hey, it’s okay. Come on, group hug.

00:30:12.071 --> 00:30:13.980
- Ouch!
- I’m joining too.

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:18.925
Thanks, everyone.

00:30:23.442 --> 00:30:25.284
Alright, alright.

00:30:27.703 --> 00:30:28.830
So… who’s comforting who here?

00:30:29.214 --> 00:30:30.512
It’s just sad, okay?

00:30:30.591 --> 00:30:32.905
Come on, it’s not even your story.

00:30:40.023 --> 00:30:40.890
It’s okay.

00:30:45.285 --> 00:30:46.484
Is that P’Fun?

00:30:48.339 --> 00:30:49.100
Yeah.

00:30:54.331 --> 00:30:55.685
You still keep the photo up like this.

00:30:56.435 --> 00:30:57.742
Don’t you miss her like crazy?

00:30:58.585 --> 00:30:59.851
I miss her a lot.

00:31:01.139 --> 00:31:02.911
My tear is back—pause it first.

00:31:05.728 --> 00:31:06.407
Hey!

00:31:06.856 --> 00:31:08.331
I’ve got a great idea for you.

00:31:12.028 --> 00:31:13.168
Here.

00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:18.251
Here.

00:31:19.226 --> 00:31:20.358
Why don’t we put our photo up?

00:31:21.342 --> 00:31:22.490
Isn’t that a bad idea?

00:31:27.585 --> 00:31:30.253
Here—right here.
You’re the guardian spirit, so you belong down here.

00:31:30.474 --> 00:31:32.180
Ah—hey!

00:31:35.367 --> 00:31:37.177
So I have to study while staring at your faces?

00:31:37.391 --> 00:31:38.816
- Exactly.
- Yep.

00:31:39.001 --> 00:31:40.536
Like we’re keeping you company.

00:31:41.444 --> 00:31:42.466
That’s nice.

00:31:42.502 --> 00:31:44.595
He kind of like it.

00:31:44.715 --> 00:31:46.475
- Don’t ask me for more, though.
- Yea.

00:31:46.792 --> 00:31:47.745
That’s all I’ve got.

00:31:48.228 --> 00:31:49.062
Just one photo.

00:31:54.693 --> 00:31:57.082
So what are you gonna do about P’Fah?

00:31:59.032 --> 00:32:00.259
I honestly don’t know yet.

00:32:01.333 --> 00:32:03.598
Are you just gonna let things stay awkward like this?

00:32:04.404 --> 00:32:05.782
It’s just…

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:07.204
not a good idea.

00:32:07.804 --> 00:32:09.125
It’s way too awkward.

00:32:09.822 --> 00:32:11.842
Yeah, I noticed.

00:32:12.048 --> 00:32:13.402
I think you and P’Fah are—

00:32:13.607 --> 00:32:16.245
- weird.
- Do you think P’Fah’s mad at me, North?

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:17.851
For pushing him away like that?

00:32:19.068 --> 00:32:20.190
If it were me?

00:32:20.908 --> 00:32:22.087
I’d punch you.

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:26.277
- That bad?
- That bad. With a mouth like that, you deserve it.

00:32:26.327 --> 00:32:27.777
Then you’d be first in line.

00:32:29.125 --> 00:32:31.828
- I probably do deserve a punch.
- Yeah, bring your face here.

00:32:33.482 --> 00:32:35.977
- Say no more.
- Hey, what are you doing?

00:32:36.242 --> 00:32:38.829
He wants to get punched, is that okay?

00:32:38.887 --> 00:32:40.657
You scare him. Come here.

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:48.080
I’ve been thinking about this all along.

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:50.630
That I could get over P’Fah.

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.250
If I just stayed out of it, it should end.

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:56.080
But the more we see each other,

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:57.950
the more distant we feel.

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:02.990
I guess I just regret it.

00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:04.910
That things can’t go back to how they were.

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:08.260
And it hurts.

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.470
If in the end, I have to lose P’Fah.

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.910
So what was “before” like, then?

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:18.130
Well…

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:20.120
We took care of each other.

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:22.740
We worried about each other. We meant well.

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:25.660
I just want him to know that—

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:27.760
if he has no one,

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.670
and he turns around,

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.720
he’ll always find me right here.

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:36.250
no matter who I am in his life.

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:41.460
No matter who you are in his life?

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:49.670
I’ve got it.

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:53.010
A way for Maew to talk to P’Fah,

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:54.580
to look after him,

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:57.870
and let P’Fah know someone always cares.

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:02.090
What is it?

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:08.840
He's here.

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:11.710
Hey!

00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:18.200
Let’s see—what was the first thing you gave P’Fah?

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:20.170
- What is it?
- A sandwich and chocolate milk.

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:22.480
Isn’t that too basic?

00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:25.790
I didn’t know what he liked, so I bought what I like.

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:28.650
But I think P’Fah would like it.

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.830
Hey, I already re-check with P’Hill.

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:34.040
You can take the stuff

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:35.490
and leave it before class.

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:36.600
Mm.

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:39.600
Have you written him a letter yet?

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:40.780
I have.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.260
See? A smiling picture.

00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:47.480
Even with zero expectations, I’m still disappointed.

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:51.070
Why didn’t you write at least a message?
So he’d know how you feel.

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:55.730
It’s my first one. I didn’t know what to write.

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.740
Um… Hello.

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:00.440
That’s way too basic.

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:04.600
You’ve gotta write more than that,
so he’ll remember you.

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:07.160
P’Fah, I freaking like you so much.

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:09.080
Hey, that works!

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:10.330
I’m kidding.

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:11.500
Ugh.

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:13.080
But we agree, though.

00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:16.080
We think he’d find it kind of funny.

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:20.040
Yeah, just write it. Trust me.

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:22.850
Okay.

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:26.930
Come on, you practiced forging handwriting, right? Let me see.

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:29.560
I

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:31.090
really like P'.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:32.460
So much.

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:37.900
But if you call him “P’,” won’t he know we’re freshmen?

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:39.170
Yeah.

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:45.110
I think you should write “you.”

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.030
That way he won’t know if it’s a senior or a junior.

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.810
Right?

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:49.960
- “You?”
- Yeah, write “you.” Better that way.

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:51.690
Smart for once.

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:53.190
In my whole life.

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:57.130
I really, really like you.

00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:58.910
So much.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:00.910
- Yeah.
- That’s it. Exactly.

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:02.290
Let’s do this.

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:05.500
Let’s go. Let’s go.

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:09.780
Do you think this method will really work?

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:13.550
You’re already this far. You can’t back out now.

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.400
Or if Maew’s not ready, should we come another day?

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:17.920
Today’s the day.

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:19.660
Be more confident.

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:21.800
Come on.

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.240
Hey, P’Arthit.

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:36.380
You scared the hell out of me.

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:40.660
What should we do?

00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:43.820
Phoon, now’s the moment.

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:46.070
Put it down there. He’ll see it.

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:48.670
He’ll take it to P’Fah himself. Go.

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:50.570
Right now.

00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:51.590
Damn it.

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.170
P’Fah has hundreds of friends.

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:55.290
Why does it have to be this idiot who needs to pee?

00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:57.970
Then it has to be this idiot.

00:36:58.650 --> 00:36:59.600
- On me.
- Huh?

00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:04.710
Be careful, okay?

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.950
- North, stop messing around. Hurry up.
- Relax.

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:14.510
Why don’t you rappel down next time?

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:11.090
To: Tonfah

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:15.560
Do you think I’m a delivery rider or what?

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.090
Hey!

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:34.280
- What?!
- He just ate it.

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:38.630
What’s wrong with him?

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:40.970
How come?

00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:42.220
It’s okay.

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:45.250
It’s okay, man.

00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:47.160
It’s just a snack.

00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:49.930
But I think the letter should reach him.

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:51.250
Yeah.

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:52.190
I guess.

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:53.100
Wait—

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.490
I don’t know, what if he ate the letter too?

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:57.120
Who the hell eats letters, North?

00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:59.380
His name’s Arthit, right?

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.160
Yeah, P’Fah’s friend.

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:02.620
Bad attitude.

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:05.520
If he were nice, would he eat someone else’s stuff like that?

00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:15.440
Fah.

00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:16.900
Someone left this for you.

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:22.960
- Is it good?
- Yeah, it’s good.

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:27.770
How many pieces is this today already?
You’ve got a lot of admirers lately.

00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:29.880
Yeah.

00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:33.150
Open it.

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:36.340
I thought you ate it all.

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:37.630
There’s more.

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:45.380
Hey, there’s milk left.

00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:58.850
I really like you so much.

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:01.690
What are you smiling about?

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:04.810
Nothing.

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:06.340
Cute.

00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:28.070
Is it worked?

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:38.210
Speak of the devil.

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.590
We’ll begin the next mission starting tomorrow.

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:50.410
I’d like to inform you that I’ve found a delivery person for you.

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:54.270
Bobby is willing to deliver for you every morning in exchange for one can of cola.

00:40:54.750 --> 00:41:01.480
I guarantee that P’Fah will never be able to trace it back to you. Over.

00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:08.250
Copy that. Out!

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:23.730
Why chocolate milk anyway?

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:25.330
Because I like it.

00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:26.860
And you bought just one?

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:31.610
- I could’ve bought them all.
- Ooh, big spender.

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:34.990
Hey!

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:42.250
That one’s Bobby’s.

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:45.400
Who’s Bobby?

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:46.970
Cupid.

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:48.810
I mean Bobby.

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:51.220
He’s a friend of my cousin.

00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:52.830
Some distant relative, and—

00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:54.720
Huh?

00:41:57.370 --> 00:41:59.670
Well, Bobby is—

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:06.040
Just one is fine.

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:09.400
One is enough to fill P’Arthit anyway.

00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:12.630
Better than throwing it away.

00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:13.330
Yeah.

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.910
So about the letter—

00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:21.680
Do you know what you’re going to write yet?

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:24.120
Hmm.

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:27.670
I honestly have no idea yet.

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:37.690
Don’t forget, man. Your first letter has to make a grand debut.
So he’ll remember you.

00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:40.470
Enough already.

00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:43.110
Why make such a big deal out of it?

00:42:44.890 --> 00:42:47.180
So P’Fah will be impressed.

00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:55.620
I’ll give it a try.

00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:01.410
How dare you take my snacks out?

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:08.930
Where’s the letter?

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:11.130
Here. I’m about to write it.

00:43:20.290 --> 00:43:22.520
Hurry up. I’ve got class, you know.

00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:28.930
What do you think of my handwriting?

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:33.740
- Looks natural?
- Hey, it works. Pretty convincing.

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:35.760
You’re good at forging handwriting too.

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:37.940
Not weird, right?

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:39.610
Heh. Perfect.

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:47.670
Give this to Bobby too.

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:49.360
Roger that.

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:50.610
Count on me.

00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:52.510
Hey.

00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:54.040
See you.

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:16.610
P’Fah.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.790
Um… someone asked me to give this to you.

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:23.290
Yes.

00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:44.530
Thank you.

00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:15.680
This morning, the weather is nice.
The sky is clear.

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:17.760
The sun isn’t too harsh.

00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:20.420
It’s a good start to the day.

00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:23.160
I hope you’ll be happy all day long.

00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:44.980
That Bobby guy delivered it straight to P’Fah himself.

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:47.610
So what did P’Fah say?

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:49.300
He didn’t say anything.

00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:52.880
Okay.

00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:55.540
Hey, it’s fine. You’re just getting started.

00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:56.230
Yeah.

00:45:56.290 --> 00:45:58.670
Don’t you realize how many people send him stuff every day?

00:45:59.210 --> 00:46:02.130
True. This kind of thing takes consistency.

00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:04.370
If you keep sending them, you’ll win him over eventually.

00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:05.270
Exactly.

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:06.560
But—

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:09.720
Honestly, I don’t want to compete with anyone.

00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:14.500
I just want to be by P’Fah’s side, in any way.

00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:17.910
So many people like him anyway.

00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:20.490
I don’t think it has to be me.

00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:25.620
- But it’s impossible not to nope, right?
- Hope.

00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:27.230
Well…

00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:29.100
Just a little.

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:31.340
Only a little, though.

00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:34.210
Yeah, so—

00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:36.040
Why send letters anyway?

00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:39.910
- Honestly, wouldn’t adding him on LINE be easier?
- Come on.

00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:42.750
I’d probably get blocked right away.

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:47.350
Maew likes writing letters, so he's using the way he likes.

00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:49.870
To express his feelings to someone he likes.

00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:51.300
That feels best.

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:53.820
Yeah, I mean—

00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:55.470
Writing letters…

00:46:56.070 --> 00:46:58.840
It’s like reflecting on your own feelings.

00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:00.980
Besides getting to—

00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:02.970
Write to the person you love,

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:04.550
You also get to understand yourself.

00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:07.610
Even if he doesn’t reply to your letters.

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:10.230
Even if P’Tonfah doesn’t reply,

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:12.580
At least he’ll know that

00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:14.160
Someone out there likes him.

00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:15.270
Yeah.

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:16.750
True.

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:19.010
That’s better than liking someone for nothing.

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:21.360
What do you mean, liking someone for nothing?

00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:23.190
Liking them and keeping it to yourself.

00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:29.520
If you love someone and they don’t even know,
what’s the point in the end?

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:35.360
For me, meant well only has meaning
when it actually reaches someone.

00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:38.010
Hey, hey. Ow.

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:45.180
So when you realized you liked P’Jo,

00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:46.470
What did you do?

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:48.650
I told him straight up.

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:50.720
And I even gave him my gear.

00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:54.930
- He gave him his gear before they were even dating.
- Of course.

00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:56.880
If I like him, why would I hold back?

00:47:57.720 --> 00:47:59.150
I don’t think I could do that.

00:47:59.690 --> 00:48:03.180
You don’t have to be like me. What you’re doing is fine.

00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:05.550
Don’t overthink it yet.

00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:07.850
Wait and see how P’Tonfah reacts first.

00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:12.630
If he really isn’t okay with it, then you can step back.

00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:14.510
Huh? Step back?

00:48:14.650 --> 00:48:16.840
Hey, just back off like that?

00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:19.290
- You just started.
- True.

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:24.170
I think you should keep sending letters like this
and see how he responds first.

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:28.520
But in the end, you have to let him know
that you’re Typhoon who likes him.

00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:30.170
Not just the kid next door.

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:32.600
Come on. You’ve got this.

00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:37.850
Don’t overthink it, Maew.

00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:39.450
Is it good?

00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:44.350
With them around, even heavy things feel lighter.

00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:47.770
I felt like I’d been given a special blessing by you, Fun.

00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:49.680
Since having friends,

00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:52.620
I no longer felt abandoned.

00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:54.910
Don’t worry, Fun.

00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:57.050
I'm stronger now.

00:48:57.380 --> 00:49:00.360
I eat more, sleep more,

00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:02.360
Smile and laugh,

00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:04.200
And much happier.

00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:09.270
And most importantly, I finally had the courage to follow my own feelings.

00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:12.730
From now on, it’s up to P'Fah.

00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:54.120
The weather is nice this morning.

00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:58.000
The sky is clear, and the sun isn’t too hot.

00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:00.690
It’s a good way to start the day.

00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:03.590
I hope you’ll be happy all day.

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:13.060
Mm.

00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:19.760
I don’t think P'Fah likes it.

00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:23.930
I won’t tease you then.

00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:26.670
I’m going.

00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:37.190
Hello? Yes, yes.

00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:38.980
Hurry up, hurry.

00:50:42.010 --> 00:50:43.780
Let’s go, go.

00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:13.560
P'Fah, enjoy your meal.

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:15.230
Thank you.

00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:23.050
You seem more okay than I expected.

00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:24.500
How so?

00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:29.890
I thought you were going to back off already.

00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:31.440
P'Fah didn’t reply.

00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:33.340
And there are other competitors too.

00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:38.310
It’s not that bad, even though I want to talk to him.

00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:42.140
If this is all it gets to be, then this is all it is.

00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:48.140
Do you remember what you told me, North?

00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:51.040
At least it reached him.

00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:53.190
My feelings.

00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:58.260
I’m glad you’re okay.

00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:01.900
You’ve really grown up, Maew.

00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:50.340
Jo, look at Fah. He’s being possessive.

00:53:02.590 --> 00:53:05.150
I guess you haven’t eaten breakfast yet.

00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:09.130
You might be wondering why I often give you tuna sandwiches and chocolate milk.

00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:11.690
It’s not because I don’t know what else to give you.

00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:14.090
I just think they taste good.

00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:52.380
Hey.

00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:54.260
What is it?

00:53:55.650 --> 00:53:56.560
What’s this?

00:53:56.970 --> 00:53:58.120
Just open it.

00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:08.500
Chocolate milk and sandwiches really are delicious.

00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:10.420
Make sure you finish them.

00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:17.470
Caught you.

00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:20.200
So, do you like him?

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:21.890
Not to the point of liking him yet.

00:54:21.970 --> 00:54:23.330
I just want to get to know him more.

00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:25.610
I feel like I could float right now.

00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:28.940
Does he like you, or the person in the letters?

00:54:29.530 --> 00:54:32.400
He keeps trying to draw a line between us.

00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:34.760
But I’ve never crossed that line.

00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:37.210
Look at this. P'Fah is totally flirting with you.

00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:39.460
So what about the person who sent the letters?

00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:42.060
I think he’s pretty cute.

00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:43.980
Happy birthday.

00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:45.290
Thank you.

00:54:45.690 --> 00:54:47.510
Don’t you want to know who he is?
