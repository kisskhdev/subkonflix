00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.810
(Previously)
My name's Leo. I'm your brother.

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.883
You two seem close. Are you dating?

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.105
So what do I do to make two cats get along?

00:00:07.134 --> 00:00:08.392
Cats are like humans.

00:00:08.414 --> 00:00:10.160
You need to help them build good memories together.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.181
Let's do this together.

00:00:12.203 --> 00:00:13.738
Why do I have to help you?

00:00:13.767 --> 00:00:14.858
I'm your friggin' brother.

00:00:14.901 --> 00:00:15.869
Just do whatever I tell you.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.287
Yeah!!!!

00:00:19.316 --> 00:00:21.752
Tiger. Can I go into Mom's room?

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.989
If you're worried about your brother, go talk to him.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.810
Yuck, you smell like cigarettes.

00:00:29.847 --> 00:00:33.483
But this smell is what tells you you're not alone anymore.

00:00:33.653 --> 00:00:34.555
Happy birthday na.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.698
Thank you for this birthday gift.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.781
Hey!

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.461
I'm older. Just do what I say.

00:00:51.476 --> 00:00:52.574
When you can't win the argument,

00:00:52.603 --> 00:00:53.810
you pull the seniority card, huh?

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:55.890
Calm down, you two.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.738
We just had a bonding party last night.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.236
Didn't that help at all?

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.850
I already eased up.

00:01:00.887 --> 00:01:02.450
I'm letting him watch the café alone.

00:01:02.487 --> 00:01:03.476
Why are you still whining?

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.821
You think I don't know?

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.752
You're leaving the café to me
because you're going to Korat.

00:01:07.774 --> 00:01:09.454
I'm going there to make merit
for Mom's 100-day memorial.

00:01:09.483 --> 00:01:12.021
You already took care of the funeral.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:13.607
It's my turn this time.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.192
You stay here scooping cat litter.

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:16.720
If you just need someone to watch the café,

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.850
want me to help out?

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.600
Good.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.498
You draw lots for us.

00:01:21.556 --> 00:01:24.029
Whoever's name comes up
gets to go make merit for Mom.

00:01:24.058 --> 00:01:25.600
That's not the kind of help I meant.

00:01:25.629 --> 00:01:26.000
Deal.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.916
The winner goes with Tiger.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.549
The loser stays here cleaning cat poop.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.454
I can just watch the café for both of you.

00:01:41.483 --> 00:01:42.181
Draw!

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.658
PUNARI VILAWONG

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.436
I knew…

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.189
you'd pick me no matter what.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.410
I knew you'd want me to do this, right?

00:02:05.432 --> 00:02:07.258
JE MEOW

00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:07.985
LYNX / LYNX

00:02:08.014 --> 00:02:10.327
I've been such a good little brother to him.

00:02:10.356 --> 00:02:12.007
Didn't you really leave anything for me,

00:02:12.596 --> 00:02:13.876
besides cat litter duty?

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.981
The 2-digit lottery would be nice, mom.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.792
Cat-Cheer Café, wel...

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.545
Thank you, Mom.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.698
You sent me the jackpot.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.185
How are you while you're here, Mom?

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.610
Not lonely, I hope.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:46.887
It's your old stomping grounds after all.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:52.400
By the way,

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.225
I met Leo.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.720
We're doing fine.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.760
They really are, Je Meow.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.469
Except they fight every day.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.152
I fight with all your kids, don't I?

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.156
Every single one of them's a pain.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.138
Especially the one you said
would be the hardest to crack.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.749
I've experienced that firsthand.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.945
Hey.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.909
Who are you talking about?

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.192
I mean…

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.330
the one your mom promised me.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.607
She said if I could get him
to accept my friend request,

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.916
she'd give him to me
plus the cat café.

00:03:31.563 --> 00:03:33.560
Now I've got the café.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.098
All that's left is…

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.778
Water, Mom.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.410
I forgot to bring you water.

00:03:40.525 --> 00:03:41.667
Can you go buy it for me?

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.189
Changing the subject already, huh?

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.109
I know…

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.905
If you were still here,

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.436
you'd be laughing right now, right?

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.734
Who told me he'd never have
a lover in this lifetime?

00:04:18.756 --> 00:04:19.607
Come on, Mom.

00:04:19.643 --> 00:04:22.123
As far back as I can remember,
you were left all alone.

00:04:22.152 --> 00:04:23.352
Who would dare have a lover?

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.210
And you kept telling me every day
that being alone was best.

00:04:28.232 --> 00:04:29.621
You actually believed me?

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:34.312
You can tell, right?

00:04:34.334 --> 00:04:35.847
Tiger's a good person.

00:04:35.883 --> 00:04:37.134
He's so good that…

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.301
I don't want him to make a bad choice,

00:04:41.045 --> 00:04:42.591
like you did with Dad.

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.400
If you were still here, I'd want to ask you...

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.225
how can a kid born from a mistake like me

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.480
be a good partner to someone?

00:04:58.014 --> 00:04:59.250
Why are you back already?

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.945
I'm not done talking to Mom.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.930
Hi.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.500
"Cat for Cash"
(Episode 6)

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.992
Have you been to Korat before?

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.112
This is my first time here.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.745
Grandpa Petch keeps
his parents' ashes at this temple.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.261
So he brought your mom's ashes here too.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.818
Have you two eaten yet?

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.861
We already had a little something.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:33.265
That's good.

00:06:33.301 --> 00:06:35.076
Then come eat at our place.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.840
Right, honey?

00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:37.323
Since you're already here.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:38.240
Okay?

00:06:38.276 --> 00:06:39.490
Thank you, Grandma.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.396
But we should head back
and look after the café.

00:06:41.556 --> 00:06:43.883
Come on. Stop by just for a bit.

00:06:43.912 --> 00:06:45.563
It's not far from here.

00:06:45.585 --> 00:06:46.334
It won't take long.

00:06:46.487 --> 00:06:47.389
Come on, honey.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.520
Let them head back and rest.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.989
Oh, sorry.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.970
Alright then, have a safe trip home.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.101
Grandpa Petch,

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:00.887
where's your house?

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.152
I think Lynx would love to try
Grandma's cooking.

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.770
Don't you want to see
the house your mom grew up in?

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.025
Lynx never mentioned
he had a younger brother.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.116
I'm his half-brother.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.570
Lynx never mentioned

00:07:29.607 --> 00:07:31.105
having such a good-looking vet...

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.909
I mean, such a dedicated vet.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.530
Granny Juu's pretty old.

00:07:38.552 --> 00:07:40.640
Je Meow asked me
to check on her every month.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.505
How about food?

00:07:43.549 --> 00:07:44.785
Are you asking me out?

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.261
You can pick the place.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.509
I meant Granny Juu.

00:07:48.552 --> 00:07:50.014
Is she eating normally?

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.330
Oh.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.720
Yeah, she is.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.236
Then there's nothing to worry about.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.280
This month you pass, Granny Juu.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:04.916
Since you're here,

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:07.570
can I treat you to dessert?

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.843
I'll take a bread with
butter and condensed milk.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:13.381
Krapor.

00:08:13.403 --> 00:08:14.007
Yes?

00:08:14.043 --> 00:08:15.069
What are you doing here?

00:08:15.512 --> 00:08:17.510
I never miss free food.

00:08:18.538 --> 00:08:21.789
Dr. Pom, how's Granny Juu
doing this month?

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.214
She's in good health
for a 15-year-old cat.

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.890
Whoa, 15 years?

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:33.454
I heard one cat year
equals four human years.

00:08:33.498 --> 00:08:35.665
If there's anything
you want to do for her, do it now.

00:08:35.694 --> 00:08:36.770
Don't make her wait.

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:39.709
If there's anything
I want to do for her…

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.705
Does finding her
a grandson-in-law count?

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:48.000
I've got an idea.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.323
Can you wait here for me?

00:08:51.352 --> 00:08:52.349
I'll be right back.

00:08:52.385 --> 00:08:55.600
I'm sure Granny Juu's
gonna love this.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:07.716
Look who's here.

00:09:11.141 --> 00:09:12.545
Who's here?

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.072
Come on in, kids.

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:16.145
Hi again.

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:17.309
PRESIDENT OF THE KORAT
CAT OWNERS ASSOCIATION

00:09:17.345 --> 00:09:20.690
Grandpa Petch is the president of the
Korat Cat Owners Association.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:21.570
Oh.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.978
Come on up.

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:26.640
Make yourselves at home.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.923
(Who's that? He looks like Meow.)

00:09:31.374 --> 00:09:33.370
He's Meow's son.

00:09:34.645 --> 00:09:37.115
(That means he's your grandson.)

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.290
(Can he talk to us like you do?)

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:44.683
You're wondering, huh?

00:09:46.014 --> 00:09:48.010
Let's find out.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:11.876
How is it?

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.483
Can you eat it?

00:10:13.512 --> 00:10:15.040
It's really delicious.

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:20.320
How's the café doing?

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:24.821
It's doing well, Grandpa.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.436
How's the cat association?

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.138
It's doing well too.

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:39.789
You've got to try my omelet.

00:10:39.832 --> 00:10:40.901
It's not just a simple omelet, you know.

00:10:40.923 --> 00:10:41.985
No one makes it like I do.

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.578
Give me some.

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:48.676
I have it every day,
and it's always delicious.

00:10:51.876 --> 00:10:52.712
Thank you.

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.741
No, Lynx, just leave it.

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:14.160
Let your grandpa clean up.

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:15.600
You come with me.

00:11:15.643 --> 00:11:17.301
I've got something to show you.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.301
Come on.

00:11:19.352 --> 00:11:19.978
Okay.

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:52.603
Grandpa Petch.

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:53.781
Hm?

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.480
That piano is yours?

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:57.556
No.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.978
So you've been helping Lynx at the café,

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.829
are you two friends?

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.101
Well… not exactly.

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:15.192
We…

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:19.730
(Looks like they're dating for sure.)

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:22.269
No, I'm just his creditor.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:27.541
(What? Don't tell me he can hear me too?)

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:37.527
How did my family's secret
end up with you?

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:45.985
What's taking Krapor so long?

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:57.709
Yeah, we've been waiting forever.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.694
It's not a bad thing though.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:04.538
I should treat him to a meal to thank him.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.032
I'm back.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:11.920
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:15.672
Krapor.

00:13:15.701 --> 00:13:16.327
Yeah?

00:13:16.363 --> 00:13:17.243
What did you bring?

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:18.676
You guys,

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.832
do you know what old folks want most,

00:13:21.883 --> 00:13:24.720
but their kids can't give them?

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:26.261
What is it?

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:29.410
It's… time.

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:32.814
That sounds kind of familiar.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:34.603
Isn't that from How to Make
Millions Before “Grandmeow” Dies?

00:13:34.625 --> 00:13:35.381
Grandma!

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:39.134
Granny Juu had babies once.

00:13:39.192 --> 00:13:42.516
Je Meow gave one to my mom.

00:13:42.552 --> 00:13:45.636
So I brought her child here
so they could spend time together.

00:13:45.672 --> 00:13:47.512
They can have a happy reunion.

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:49.076
Hold on, Krapor.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:50.530
What's wrong?

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:52.887
They might fight.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.781
No, they won't.

00:13:55.811 --> 00:13:57.062
They're mother and child.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.618
They'll definitely recognize each other.

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:07.207
Hey, AJ. What's gotten into you?

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:08.909
That's your mom.

00:14:08.945 --> 00:14:10.560
I told you.

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:12.203
Cats recognize each other by scent.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.381
When the scent changes,

00:14:13.418 --> 00:14:15.380
they can't recognize
even their own mom and dad.

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:18.465
And that's the end of my Grandmeow story.

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:20.276
What a bummer.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.527
Your mom was a smart student.

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:31.367
She was at the
top of her class every year.

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:34.901
Every day, she'd just bury
herself in books in this room.

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:40.218
I can't picture that.

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:43.054
All I remember is Mom buried in the couch,

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.629
drinking beer and
watching melodramas day in day out.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.567
Deep down, she probably
wanted that kind of life.

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:52.450
But she felt obligated to your grandpa.

00:14:52.472 --> 00:14:55.098
One time, she snuck out
to play games with her friends.

00:14:55.141 --> 00:14:56.378
Grandpa caught her.

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:58.654
He dragged her home
and beat her with a cane,

00:14:58.676 --> 00:14:59.738
and she ended up with a fever.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:07.127
How did a top student like Mom
end up with Dad?

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.789
She never told you anything about that?

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.629
She told me that...

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.734
Dad was a senior who gave her
advice about grad school.

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:17.520
She was kind of innocent,

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:19.614
and he got her drunk.

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:24.465
Actually, she wasn't really that innocent.

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:31.243
She was smart like Grandpa,

00:15:31.287 --> 00:15:33.883
but boy-crazy just like me
when I was young.

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:40.138
But Mom always told me
she didn't care about love.

00:15:40.661 --> 00:15:41.403
Really?

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:43.963
She just didn't say what she really felt.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.738
If she didn't care about it,

00:15:45.781 --> 00:15:47.978
you wouldn't be here.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:51.818
Even though things didn't work out
between your mom and dad,

00:15:51.861 --> 00:15:55.214
it was definitely love in the beginning.

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:03.621
There's a lot you don't know.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.967
I've kept all her stuff in this room.

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:09.920
Take your time getting to know her.

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:11.985
Alright.

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:43.090
I was the last person with Je Meow.

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:47.992
I remember she whispered
something in my ear.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:50.792
Next thing I knew,

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:53.461
I could hear cats talking.

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:58.858
It's a power transfer.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.465
We can communicate with cats.

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:07.985
This power only gets passed down
to blood relatives.

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.018
Even Grandma Tam doesn't have it.

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:18.218
I think Je Meow wanted
to pass it on to Lynx,

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:19.869
but…

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:21.701
she didn't get the chance.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.807
But I can pass it back to Lynx now.

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:27.556
You can't just easily pass it back.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:34.850
And this power can only
be transferred once.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:43.069
I already transferred it to Meow.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.120
So that means…

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:49.061
I'm the only one
who can pass it on to Lynx?

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:51.738
Let me go get him.

00:17:51.767 --> 00:17:52.698
Hold on.

00:17:54.312 --> 00:17:59.403
Only someone who truly loves cats
can use this power.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:01.898
Do you think Lynx is ready?

00:18:04.515 --> 00:18:05.973
I'm not sure.

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:09.112
But don't worry.

00:18:09.963 --> 00:18:11.960
I'll keep this power safe

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.498
and won't give it to anyone else.

00:18:13.534 --> 00:18:14.901
(Can we trust him?)

00:18:14.945 --> 00:18:19.549
(To be sure, make him marry Lynx now.)

00:18:19.592 --> 00:18:20.436
No need to go that far yet.

00:18:20.472 --> 00:18:22.909
(Why?! You don't like our Lynx?)

00:18:22.952 --> 00:18:24.690
It's not like that. Well, I…

00:18:24.734 --> 00:18:25.294
Hey!

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:29.570
So how do you feel about my grandson?

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:37.600
I like Lynx.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:42.356
Will that be okay with you?

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:48.807
At least…

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:54.320
you've got the guts
to admit your true feelings,

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:58.007
unlike Lynx's dad.

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.258
You don't have to worry at all.

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:03.789
I promise

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:06.000
I'll make Lynx love cats

00:19:06.529 --> 00:19:08.000
and he'll be able to talk to them eventually.

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:14.603
Now I understand

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.578
why my daughter gave this power to you.

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:36.814
Excuse me, Mom.

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:42.356
(The Diary of Maew Meow's Journey)

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:46.523
(First day of my uni life – Dad dropping
me off and picking me up like a kid.)

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:49.323
(Good news, Dad's letting me
go to Loy Krathong.)

00:19:49.352 --> 00:19:52.814
(Bad news, Dad's deadline is 6 PM.)

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.556
(If I end up single, it's his fault.)

00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:00.930
(Woohoo, I finally snuck out to watch
a movie with my uni friends for the first time.)

00:20:00.967 --> 00:20:04.021
(The scene where the heroine plays
“Canon” on the piano was so romantic.)

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:07.512
When you were with me,
all I ever saw you play was money pool.

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.076
"THE HUNT FOR 9 CATS"

00:20:14.284 --> 00:20:19.284
(Yay! Dad finally let me stay over
with my friends to celebrate graduation.)

00:20:19.323 --> 00:20:25.025
(Since Korat is the city of cats,
we're going to find all 9 cats on this trip.)

00:20:25.054 --> 00:20:28.741
(Whoever finishes this trip together
will be friends until old age…)

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.323
(Like a cat's 9 lives.)

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:23.200
Someone left this Canon sheet music here.

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:25.396
So I played it.

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:31.840
I know who left it.

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:42.443
Mom once planned a trip to
search for cats around Korat with friends.

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:46.029
But she never got to go

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:48.712
because she had me.

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:54.603
Since we're already here,

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:56.647
how about we go find those cats for her?

00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:57.847
Can we do that?

00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:59.221
Why not?

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:01.636
You still owe me a date, remember?

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.752
Take care of yourself.

00:22:17.781 --> 00:22:19.403
Come visit us some time.

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:20.494
Yes, Grandma.

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.498
Here. I made extra for you two.

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.370
Thank you so much.

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:29.360
Please excuse us then.

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:32.029
Goodbye.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.614
Have a safe trip.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.254
Please take care.

00:22:38.552 --> 00:22:39.832
Thanks.

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:46.712
CHOMPHON GATE

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:54.050
Before anything else,

00:22:54.072 --> 00:22:55.330
we should pay our respects here.

00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:01.978
May this trip help us find all 9 cats.

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:06.800
They say after you pay your respects,

00:23:06.836 --> 00:23:08.334
you walk through the gate and make a wish.

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:09.978
If you walk 1 round,

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:11.578
you'll come back to Korat again.

00:23:11.621 --> 00:23:12.472
That's nice.

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:14.276
Your grandparents would be happy.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:16.538
If you walk 2 rounds,

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:18.400
you'll get a job in Korat.

00:23:18.429 --> 00:23:19.498
This one's nice too.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.247
If the café fails,
we can find jobs here.

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:24.850
If you walk 3 rounds…

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:27.949
What happens?

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:31.389
You'll get a lover from Korat.

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:34.945
You were born here.

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:37.636
Does that count as being from Korat?

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:43.687
We should get going,

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:44.850
or we won't find all 9 cats.

00:24:18.763 --> 00:24:21.570
(This trip starts with a local cat breed.)

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.600
(Cat No. 2 is an indie teen cat.)

00:24:31.643 --> 00:24:33.600
(Never stays inside the box.)

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:42.123
(Cat No. 3 is a beauty queen cat.)

00:24:42.589 --> 00:24:44.590
(So gorgeous, it earned a crown.)

00:24:46.363 --> 00:24:49.592
(Cat No. 4 is a flirty cat.)

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:52.450
(Loves using bridges to get closer.)

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:59.490
(Cats No. 5 and 6
are on Cat Walking Street.)

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:04.261
(One's the big boss,
the other's the baby of the gang.)

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:08.370
(Cat No. 7 is a shy cat.)

00:25:08.392 --> 00:25:11.709
(It likes to play hide-and-seek
on this mountain.)

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:15.381
Is this one a statue or a painting?

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:18.320
I'm not sure either.

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.789
But Mom drew it like this.

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:24.341
It's somewhere on this mountain.

00:25:24.378 --> 00:25:25.272
Let's go up and see.

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:32.123
You really didn't have to walk me back.

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:34.007
I feel bad making Krapor

00:25:34.036 --> 00:25:36.010
watch the café for you.

00:25:36.996 --> 00:25:37.992
I had to.

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:41.309
You came all this way
to check on Granny Juu.

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:47.032
Being a cat is kind of sad, isn't it?

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:49.563
They can't even recognize
their own kittens.

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:54.480
I'm actually jealous of Granny Juu.

00:25:56.385 --> 00:25:57.061
Why?

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.523
My parents split while
I was still in the womb.

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:05.992
Not long after I was born,

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:09.578
before I could meet my dad, he died.

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:13.265
At least Granny Juu and her child

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.243
had some time together.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.985
If I ever ran into my dad somewhere,

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:24.894
we probably wouldn't
even recognize each other,

00:26:26.989 --> 00:26:28.567
just like Granny Juu and her child now.

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:35.578
Then tonight, after you close the café,

00:26:35.621 --> 00:26:37.578
can you bring Granny Juu
and her child to my clinic?

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:40.967
I might have a way
to keep them from fighting.

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:07.483
I looked everywhere.

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:09.738
I didn't see a cat like what your mom drew.

00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:12.967
Yeah, I looked through that side.

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:13.898
I couldn't find one either.

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:24.509
Actually, Mom drew this ages ago.

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.112
It might not be here anymore.

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:35.941
Watch your head.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.149
You okay, right?

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:48.480
Ouch.

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:51.316
What's wrong?

00:27:51.347 --> 00:27:52.940
Leg cramp.

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:58.480
Then let's rest here for a bit.

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:04.101
Have some water.

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.920
You're not playing hard to get anymore?

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:22.421
And you're not asking
for permission anymore either.

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:30.800
Feeling better now?

00:28:35.294 --> 00:28:35.694
Yes.

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:48.160
Lynx.

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:50.923
Let me see your mom's drawing again.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.665
The cave opening is the cat ears.

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:11.098
And the railings are the whiskers.

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:14.829
Yeah. You're right.

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.360
Take pictures for me.

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:33.083
“They say…

00:29:33.112 --> 00:29:35.374
if you ask someone to be your lover here,

00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:36.807
it'll come true.”

00:29:45.898 --> 00:29:50.800
“I can only dream that someday
someone will bring me up here.”

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:01.301
I'm sorry for you, Mom.

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:04.567
Real life wasn't as romantic
as you dreamed.

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:20.472
Since you're chasing these cats
to make your mother's dream come true,

00:30:22.378 --> 00:30:24.380
don't you want to help fulfill
another dream of hers too?

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:40.130
After this trip, let's become boyfriends.

00:31:02.823 --> 00:31:06.087
PHA KEP TAWAN, THAP LAN NATIONAL PARK

00:31:06.123 --> 00:31:07.090
We're here.

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:09.287
Cat No.8 is on this cliff.

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:11.665
Mom wrote it here...

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:14.269
“Cat No. 8 is a sleepy black cat.”

00:31:14.654 --> 00:31:16.650
“It only shows up at sunset.”

00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:20.530
It's right there.

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:24.523
Look at the shadow.

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:26.727
It looks just like the sleeping cat
your mom drew.

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:28.589
You're right.

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:32.523
But this one has ears.

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:39.985
Then let's add ears to it.

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:41.403
Okay.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.800
Now I get why they call it Sunset Cliff.

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:10.174
What's wrong?

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:11.927
Isn't it beautiful?

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:18.770
I've always thought that I was the
reason why my mom's life fell apart.

00:32:20.186 --> 00:32:23.840
If I hadn't been born,
she might still be here.

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:25.978
She would've stayed with
Grandpa and Grandma.

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:29.687
Maybe some decent guy
would've asked her out and

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:33.330
taken her to watch
a beautiful sunset like this.

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:40.698
You know what?

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:43.629
Your grandpa said…

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.327
you have something like your mom.

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:48.152
But I think…

00:32:49.066 --> 00:32:52.948
it's actually something of hers
that is still in you.

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.741
You didn't ruin her life.

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:01.985
But you made her…
still alive in this world.

00:33:02.014 --> 00:33:07.156
♪ I told you I love you, love you ♪

00:33:07.192 --> 00:33:08.632

everything you see,

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.069

Dr. Pom.

00:34:02.974 --> 00:34:04.290
I brought Granny Juu and her child.

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:06.821
This way.

00:34:06.843 --> 00:34:08.080
I've set up a room for them.

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:09.556
What?

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:13.214
Won't they fight
if they're in the same room?

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:14.807
Remember what you told me?

00:34:14.843 --> 00:34:17.112
If you met your dad somewhere,

00:34:17.141 --> 00:34:18.530
you wouldn't recognize each other.

00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:21.934
When Granny Juu met
her child at the café,

00:34:21.963 --> 00:34:23.956
the place was full of her scent,

00:34:23.992 --> 00:34:25.330
so her child got scared.

00:34:25.367 --> 00:34:26.676
So I thought

00:34:26.727 --> 00:34:32.283
if we bring them somewhere new
where neither of their scents is around,

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:34.181
maybe they won't fight.

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:40.341
Lynx.

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:41.287
Did you get anything?

00:34:41.323 --> 00:34:42.487
I've got bad news.

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:45.767
The owner of the last cat
went down to run errands.

00:34:46.181 --> 00:34:47.658
He will probably come back
tomorrow morning.

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:50.763
What do we do then?

00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:52.400
It's already dark.

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:54.683
If we go back,
we should leave now.

00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:57.163
Or else…

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:06.938
Lucky they have a tent for rent here.

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:11.978
And lucky you just happened
to pack extra clothes in your trunk.

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.207
I only brought them
to change during the trip.

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:20.014
I didn't actually plan
to stay overnight with you.

00:35:21.352 --> 00:35:22.218
Whatever.

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.850
I'm the one who asked you
to come up here anyway.

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:30.138
Let's see what your grandpa
cooked for us.

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:37.527
Wow.

00:35:46.705 --> 00:35:48.710
It looks like Korat stir-fried noodles
that Mom used to make.

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.920
Tonight we survived
thanks to your grandpa.

00:35:57.790 --> 00:35:58.312
Wow.

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:03.832
Honestly, I felt bad too.

00:36:06.021 --> 00:36:08.020
They even invited us over for a meal.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.992
We barely talked at the table.

00:36:14.341 --> 00:36:16.340
Like eating with strangers,

00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:19.672
rather than family.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.320
It smells just like Mom's stir-fried noodles.

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:35.476
Lynx told me…

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:39.360
Meow made stir-fried noodles for him a lot.

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:44.872
That means she remembered
what you taught her.

00:36:47.338 --> 00:36:49.340
Scent is like a cat's memory.

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:54.247
When cats are apart so long
they can't remember the old scent.

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:56.654
You just need to let them create
a new memory

00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.440
until they become the same scent again.

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:01.643
It tastes exactly like Mom's too.

00:37:01.701 --> 00:37:06.007
♪ It must be you who healed my heart again ♪

00:37:06.043 --> 00:37:08.756
♪ Used to ache with pain ♪

00:37:08.814 --> 00:37:15.330
♪ It feels so good now with you by my side ♪

00:37:15.367 --> 00:37:20.240
♪ I'll hold you close, won't let go, won't let it fade ♪

00:37:20.276 --> 00:37:23.585

00:37:23.629 --> 00:37:33.076
♪ 'Cause it's you, I found my home ♪

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:39.992
Here, Lynx.

00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:41.287
Let me rub this balm on your leg.

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:45.338
It's okay. I can do it myself.

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:49.549
Let me.

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:50.676
No, thanks.

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:51.498
Hey.

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:08.363
What's wrong?

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:10.690
It's not like we haven't stayed over
together before.

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:16.260
Yeah, but we usually have
a bunch of cats around.

00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:23.956
I'm not the kind of guy
who takes advantage.

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:28.298
My dad said the same thing to Mom
the first night they stayed together.

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:29.694
Look what happened.

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:31.287
They had me.

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:33.680
Let's be boyfriends first.

00:38:33.723 --> 00:38:34.836
Then you can worry about that.

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:52.749
Can I ask you something?

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.040
Why do you want to be my boyfriend?

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:03.425
You're like a cat, I guess?

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:07.265
Be serious.

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:21.658
When you want a cat,

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:24.661
do you need a reason

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:28.836
other than how cute it is?

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:40.923
But you know what?

00:39:42.043 --> 00:39:44.040
I never planned on
having a partner in this life.

00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:48.349
What's with that?

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:52.305
I'm definitely not the first person
in the world to hit on you.

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:56.429
If you were born with
a womanizer for a dad

00:39:57.832 --> 00:39:59.830
and a mom who gave up on love,

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:04.000
you'd think the same way.

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:07.527
No, I think of it differently.

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:11.505
What my parents couldn't give me,

00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:15.025
I'll make it happen myself.

00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:32.974
Honestly, I used to think
I was born by mistake,

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:37.585
until I came here.

00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:41.614
I learned that Mom once
had a beautiful love too,

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.112
even if it didn't last long.

00:40:47.934 --> 00:40:49.287
If it does exist,

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:53.629
I want to experience it once too.

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:34.974
What are you doing?

00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:37.134
Didn't you say you're not the type
to take advantage?

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.992
I can't stand seeing a cat shiver.

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:47.156
Are you not okay…

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:52.283
with me being like this?

00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:06.312
If you want to hug me,

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:09.541
you can't be just anyone.

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:17.410
Come back and visit again.

00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:19.309
Thank you.

00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:20.967
Have a safe trip.

00:43:21.003 --> 00:43:21.694
Thank you.

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:26.647
I just found out each national park
has its own signature stamp.

00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:27.430
THE LAST CAT WILL BE SIGNED
BY A NATIONAL PARK OFFICER.

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:30.334
Congrats on finally collecting all 9 cats.

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:34.341
Mom said

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:37.090
whoever collects all 9 cats together

00:43:37.585 --> 00:43:39.590
will be friends until old age.

00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:43.098
Who are you calling a friend?

00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:48.887
I'm your boyfriend.

00:44:02.647 --> 00:44:04.334
And I'll be that until we're old.

00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:29.592
(Next Episode)
How's everything?

00:44:29.621 --> 00:44:30.916
I heard what happened here.

00:44:30.952 --> 00:44:32.654
So those guys were looking for you, Leo?

00:44:32.676 --> 00:44:34.334
I shouldn't have let you stay.

00:44:34.363 --> 00:44:35.221
Who are you to say that?

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:36.334
You think you're so damn righteous…

00:44:36.378 --> 00:44:37.498
If you weren't the only family I had left,

00:44:37.527 --> 00:44:39.032
I never would've set foot in this place.

00:44:39.069 --> 00:44:40.240
Have you talked to Leo yet?

00:44:40.290 --> 00:44:40.989
Not yet.

00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:42.225
- Our dad's not dead.
- WICHIEN 08140199773

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:42.647
What do you want to do now?

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:43.650
Do you want to go live with him?

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:47.265
It's gonna be okay. It'll pass.

00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:49.592
If this is what you're like when drunk,

00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:51.076
I'm not talking to you.

00:44:51.112 --> 00:44:54.014
Why? Just a goodnight kiss then.

00:44:54.276 --> 00:44:56.280
I warned you. Don't do this.
