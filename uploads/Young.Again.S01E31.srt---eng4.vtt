00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:02.599
Director

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.099
Hello

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:05.480
Just call me Little Chang

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:06.459
Aunt Luo

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.060
You...

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:07.700
Is something up?

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:09.159
It's a small matter

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:09.879
Come

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.520
Just tell me if something's up

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.419
No need to be polite with me

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:14.699
Better to be polite

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.780
By the time

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.039
I finish speaking

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.259
you might not be so polite to me

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.020
What a thing to say

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:23.099
How could I be impolite to you?

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:24.139
Don't worry

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:25.479
No matter what you say

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.099
I promise to be very polite to you

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.860
You

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.379
are the master of our community

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.240
What is it, exactly?

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.580
I'm fickle

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:34.479
I...

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:37.599
have let you down

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:38.879
Come on

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:39.419
Aunt Luo

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:41.139
Being fickle is no problem

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:42.379
This...

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.699
who is the "old" one?

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.620
It's you

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.240
Me?

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.939
I...

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.759
It's your...

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:48.840
My who?

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.240
It's this place of yours

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.099
My...

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:53.979
I want a change

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.479
Change places?

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.479
I thought you wanted to change people

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.539
Change places...

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.000
No

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.819
You're changing...

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.319
Where do you plan to move?

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:07.599
I'll tell you the truth

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.500
I heard that new development

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:12.580
in Four Seasons Green Hills

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:13.759
opened an...

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:16.340
Alps International Nursing Home

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.879
It's cheap and good

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:19.639
I want to move there

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:26.780
So that's it

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.819
You agree?

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:30.800
If I don't agree

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:33.139
what else can I do?

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:34.400
That's great

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.020
Thank you

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.039
I knew you were the easiest to talk to

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.360
Thank you

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.000
Thanks a lot

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.699
Later

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:40.300
settle the bill for me

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.000
I'm going to pack my things

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.900
Bye-bye

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.840
You're just letting her go?

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:56.180
At least deduct her deposit

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:57.979
Forget it

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.840
Refund it all to her

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.939
Xiao Fang

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.340
Get those college students for me

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.759
I want to send them undercover

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.319
to gather some intel

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:09.900
I want to see

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:12.580
that Alps International Nursing Home

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:14.319
exactly what kind of

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:15.659
game they're playing

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.740
Sorry.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.079
We're not hiring salespeople.

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:29.600
We're not here to apply.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.639
We're here to learn about this place.

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:32.920
You guys...

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:34.920
came to the wrong place, right?

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.939
This is a nursing home.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.839
The youth apartments...

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:39.100
are across the street.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.699
We know.

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:44.319
We...

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:45.680
are all here on behalf of our elders

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:47.079
to check things out.

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:50.319
Is that so?

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:53.120
Then may I ask, how many elders?

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.240
Six.

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:54.920
No.

00:04:55.019 --> 00:04:55.660
Twelve.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.160
Could also be twenty-four.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.240
Four per family.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.819
Right.

00:04:59.579 --> 00:05:01.120
Does that count as a group buy?

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.279
Can we get a discount?

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:02.980
Yes.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.959
Absolutely.

00:05:04.019 --> 00:05:04.660
Please come in.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.000
Please come in.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.980
Take a look.

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:14.639
The brochure says...

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:16.439
you have artificial intelligence here.

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:17.240
High-tech stuff.

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:19.759
Yes.

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:23.160
That's a project currently in development.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.079
And health experts from Switzerland?

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.180
Right.

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:29.579
We're currently in talks.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.220
Tickets are already booked.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.160
Your ad also mentions...

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:36.279
regular full-body checkups for the elderly.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.439
Yes, we have a traditional military doctor.

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:41.040
He regularly checks the elders'

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:41.899
pulses.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.899
That's it?

00:05:44.079 --> 00:05:45.120
The ad...

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.839
also promised...

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:48.139
24-hour dining service.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.100
Yes.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.319
We have a cafeteria during the day.

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:53.620
At night, we mainly distribute...

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:54.759
instant noodles.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.759
So that's your 24-hour dining service?

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.860
You guys are really good at advertising.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.420
Thanks for the compliment.

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:08.019
Actually, if you look closely at our prices,

00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:09.120
you'll understand.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.379
With our fee structure,

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:14.100
compared to the promises in the ad,

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.199
there is a tiny little...

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.240
gap.

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:17.939
It's fine.

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:19.399
If you can't do it, don't say it.

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:22.920
Otherwise, who would come?

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:23.699
That business

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:25.339
has all been snatched by Willow New Town.

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:29.040
We have a special offer

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.019
just for you.

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:34.339
What kind of offer for us?

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:36.180
We do have one.

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:37.699
As long as you mobilize

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:39.360
your elders to move in

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.420
and purchase our VIP package,

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:44.540
every month we will

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.379
give you back 1,000 yuan.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.600
One senior,

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:49.579
1,000 yuan.

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:50.779
Four seniors,

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.899
4,000 yuan.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.420
Your monthly pocket money

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.959
is taken care of, isn't it?

00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:57.699
You want us

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.199
to scam our own dads?

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:00.300
Yes.

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:01.540
No.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.439
No.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:03.199
Uh...

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:04.379
It's not scamming your dads.

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:05.680
It is

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:06.740
living off parents.

00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:07.980
No.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.139
You can't say it like that.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.180
Isn't that how it is nowadays anyway?

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.879
We are helping your elders

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.100
pass on their inheritance

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:16.319
to you in advance.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.399
Isn't that good?

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.560
No.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:19.379
Let's go.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.339
Xiao Xin.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.019
Let's go.

00:07:21.379 --> 00:07:22.620
Think it over again?

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.560
Think it over.

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:24.519
Just think about it.

00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:25.899
Four thousand!

00:07:26.519 --> 00:07:27.459
Four thousand!

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.620
AI promises unfulfilled.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.399
Foreign experts still negotiating.

00:07:31.519 --> 00:07:33.120
Regular checkups are just pulse-taking.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.699
Meal delivery is just instant noodles.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.459
So I think

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:37.839
we have nothing to fear.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.220
That's hard to say.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.120
Nowadays,

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.019
it's the false ads that trick people.

00:07:43.819 --> 00:07:44.459
That's right.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.319
Our Grandma Luo was tricked away by them.

00:07:48.319 --> 00:07:49.019
I heard

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.480
Auntie Cai also wants to go take a look.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.339
This...

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.740
Then what should we do?

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:54.399
I suggest

00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:56.560
if they hand out brochures,

00:07:56.639 --> 00:07:57.660
we shoot a commercial.

00:07:57.879 --> 00:07:59.339
To overshadow their influence.

00:07:59.819 --> 00:08:00.519
Good idea.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.279
They are called Alps.

00:08:02.459 --> 00:08:03.579
We'll be called

00:08:03.959 --> 00:08:04.980
Bavaria.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.040
They have Swiss experts.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:08.500
We have a German doctor.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.480
Where would we get a German doctor?

00:08:11.019 --> 00:08:11.720
Me.

00:08:11.819 --> 00:08:12.620
Right.

00:08:13.139 --> 00:08:14.379
You've got it wrong.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.579
I am a senior technician.

00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:18.139
Not a health doctor.

00:08:18.439 --> 00:08:19.560
If a machine breaks,

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.259
changing parts is enough.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.480
If a person breaks,

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.040
you can also change a part.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.779
Organ transplant, right?

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.660
But I don't know how.

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:30.459
People...

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:31.459
if not fixed properly,

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:32.720
will die.

00:08:32.779 --> 00:08:34.200
Machines die too.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:35.659
They crash.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:37.419
They crash.

00:08:37.899 --> 00:08:39.559
If a machine crashes,

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:41.159
it can still be fixed.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:42.620
But once a person dies...

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:43.740
Once a person dies, well...

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.200
maybe, perhaps...

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:46.960
no.

00:08:47.639 --> 00:08:48.340
So,

00:08:48.539 --> 00:08:50.480
you need to find someone else for this.

00:08:50.799 --> 00:08:51.720
Don't, Uncle Rudy.

00:08:52.399 --> 00:08:53.360
Actually, we came to you...

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.100
not to really be a health expert.

00:08:55.279 --> 00:08:56.179
It's for a commercial.

00:08:56.639 --> 00:08:57.379
A commercial?

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:57.960
I...

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:58.720
I don't know how to do that.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.340
We want you to shoot a commercial.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.419
To play the role of a...

00:09:01.419 --> 00:09:02.940
German health expert.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.220
Be an actor.

00:09:04.379 --> 00:09:05.480
Right.

00:09:05.539 --> 00:09:06.299
Acting.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.399
Being an actor.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:08.879
Yes.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:10.940
You should've said so earlier.

00:09:11.139 --> 00:09:13.080
I can totally do that.

00:09:14.419 --> 00:09:15.100
Okay.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.259
I am the German longevity and wellness...

00:09:19.399 --> 00:09:21.139
sixth generation successor.

00:09:21.299 --> 00:09:21.940
Based on...

00:09:22.019 --> 00:09:25.559
my 30-plus years of wellness experience.

00:09:25.559 --> 00:09:26.220
Stop.

00:09:27.659 --> 00:09:28.679
Who wrote these lines?

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.720
That would be me.

00:09:31.299 --> 00:09:32.759
Are you out of your mind?

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:34.840
German longevity wellness...

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:35.799
and a "successor"?

00:09:35.899 --> 00:09:37.460
You think this is some ancestral quack doctor?

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.679
Why not?

00:09:38.899 --> 00:09:40.500
Our country's ancient medicine...

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.299
spread to Germany with Marco Polo.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.320
Marco Polo was Italian, okay?

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.539
Really?

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:48.279
I...

00:09:48.279 --> 00:09:50.460
I always thought he was in Germany.

00:09:51.259 --> 00:09:52.139
Also, this...

00:09:52.259 --> 00:09:54.580
concept of "nth generation successor"...

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.100
isn't really German.

00:09:56.259 --> 00:09:56.860
We use...

00:09:56.919 --> 00:09:58.360
"The First," "The Second"...

00:09:59.059 --> 00:09:59.720
For example...

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:01.159
William II...

00:10:01.159 --> 00:10:02.820
or Frederick IV.

00:10:02.899 --> 00:10:04.019
Then you can be called...

00:10:04.059 --> 00:10:05.919
Longevity Wellness...

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:06.720
The Sixth.

00:10:06.759 --> 00:10:07.360
Get out.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.039
What nonsense.

00:10:08.299 --> 00:10:10.679
We want to shoot a high-class commercial.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:11.940
But the way you're doing it...

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:12.940
makes it a joke.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:13.600
Exactly.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:14.840
Rewrite it.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.240
Scrap it and start over.

00:10:17.039 --> 00:10:18.139
I have a suggestion.

00:10:18.519 --> 00:10:19.639
I can introduce...

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.559
German retirement communities.

00:10:22.259 --> 00:10:24.460
Learn from their strengths...

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.340
to make us better.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.399
That's a good idea.

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.100
Why don't we just let Uncle Rudy write it?

00:10:36.139 --> 00:10:36.799
Germany

00:10:37.159 --> 00:10:40.299
has the second-oldest population

00:10:40.299 --> 00:10:41.059
in Europe,

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.679
but there are over 12,000

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.279
nursing institutions in Germany.

00:10:46.419 --> 00:10:49.419
So Germany has become a retirement paradise.

00:10:49.799 --> 00:10:50.759
Besides nursing institutions,

00:10:50.899 --> 00:10:52.460
there are also

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.480
home-based care,

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.159
shared housing for seniors,

00:10:56.259 --> 00:10:57.240
retirement tourism,

00:10:57.399 --> 00:10:58.279
vacation care,

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.419
reverse mortgages,

00:10:59.539 --> 00:11:00.539
and mutual aid care.

00:11:00.539 --> 00:11:01.399
Hold on, stop.

00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:02.059
Uncle Rudy,

00:11:02.559 --> 00:11:04.299
this isn't really working either.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.019
Why?

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.419
This commercial of ours

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.620
is to introduce Willow New Town,

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:12.259
not to introduce the German care model.

00:11:12.659 --> 00:11:15.639
Aren't we supposed to draw from the German model?

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:16.799
Drawing from it

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:19.700
is just so we can

00:11:19.799 --> 00:11:21.440
take the German care content

00:11:21.539 --> 00:11:23.679
and present it as our own.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.379
You mean

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:26.759
fake it?

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.139
That's not considered faking.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.639
It should be considered

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.960
an aspiration for a better future.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.240
But if we do this,

00:11:34.519 --> 00:11:35.399
wouldn't we be just like

00:11:35.399 --> 00:11:36.620
the Alps International Nursing Home?

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:37.279
Wouldn't it be the same?

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.080
How can that be the same?

00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:40.720
They don't have our

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.779
authentic handsome German uncle!

00:11:43.299 --> 00:11:44.120
That's right.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.240
Uncle Rudy,

00:11:45.279 --> 00:11:47.480
you are our core competitive edge!

00:11:47.779 --> 00:11:51.179
But Uncle Rudy isn't a real health expert.

00:11:52.139 --> 00:11:53.899
Do you think those TV wellness experts

00:11:53.899 --> 00:11:54.860
are all real?

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.500
They're all just extras.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:57.200
Exactly.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.340
I think

00:11:58.860 --> 00:11:59.740
lying

00:11:59.799 --> 00:12:00.600
is bad.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:02.600
I cannot lie to people.

00:12:03.019 --> 00:12:03.500
Then...

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:04.919
how about this?

00:12:05.159 --> 00:12:06.659
At the bottom of the ad,

00:12:06.659 --> 00:12:07.940
we write in very, very,

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.580
very, very, very small text:

00:12:09.679 --> 00:12:11.139
"Spokesperson: Rudy."

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.440
Then it's not lying, right?

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.059
That works too.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:13.940
That actually works?

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:14.940
Why wouldn't it?

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.220
To deal with scammers,

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:17.200
you have to do this.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.799
I think it's still not good.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.860
How about this?

00:12:21.039 --> 00:12:21.659
Uncle Rudy,

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.799
you just honestly introduce the German care model.

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:25.860
We'll film it,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:26.779
and then

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.580
you just say a few slogans for us.

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:29.399
Is that okay?

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:31.519
If it's like that,

00:12:31.539 --> 00:12:32.399
that would be fine.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.279
I'll think about it.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.179
Willow New Town

00:12:42.279 --> 00:12:44.419
In collaboration with a famous German nursing institution

00:12:44.419 --> 00:12:45.600
jointly created

00:12:45.659 --> 00:12:48.159
Bavaria International Retirement Community

00:12:48.159 --> 00:12:49.200
Welcome to visit

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:49.820
Why

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.059
that's not my voice

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:53.000
it's dubbed

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.039
Dubbed

00:12:54.559 --> 00:12:57.200
Then my introduction to the German elderly care model

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.460
why is it gone?

00:13:01.559 --> 00:13:02.879
Well, about that

00:13:03.559 --> 00:13:04.200
Uncle Rudy

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.960
The way you introduced the German elderly care model

00:13:08.019 --> 00:13:08.580
was excellent

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:09.279
Right

00:13:09.279 --> 00:13:10.840
It was simply too amazing

00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:12.399
So

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.100
it would be a pity to put it in this ad

00:13:14.559 --> 00:13:15.220
Exactly

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.539
So, we just cut it out

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:19.899
You think

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.679
what I said was excellent

00:13:21.679 --> 00:13:22.200
Right

00:13:23.019 --> 00:13:24.519
so you just

00:13:24.559 --> 00:13:25.440
cut me out?

00:13:25.799 --> 00:13:26.440
Uncle Rudy

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.200
We didn't cut *you* out

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.460
we took that video clip

00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:31.240
cut it out and saved it

00:13:31.659 --> 00:13:32.480
And then?

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:33.539
Then we just threw

00:13:34.759 --> 00:13:36.740
threw it onto a video website

00:13:37.179 --> 00:13:38.779
We specially created a

00:13:38.779 --> 00:13:40.500
introducing the German elderly care industry

00:13:40.659 --> 00:13:42.460
and even from all over the world

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:43.879
advanced elderly care experiences

00:13:43.879 --> 00:13:44.720
special program

00:13:45.159 --> 00:13:47.480
You'll be the host of this special

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.100
How about that?

00:13:49.279 --> 00:13:50.980
I'll be the host?

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.220
That's awesome

00:13:56.799 --> 00:13:57.639
What does that mean?

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.059
It means good

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.080
Hello

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.019
Bavaria International Retirement Community

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:07.759
Okay

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:08.940
Welcome to visit

00:14:10.659 --> 00:14:13.340
We'll arrange a specific time and notify you

00:14:14.519 --> 00:14:15.240
Yes

00:14:15.679 --> 00:14:17.639
Everything in the ad is available

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.360
Okay

00:14:19.539 --> 00:14:21.320
We'll notify you once it's arranged

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.340
Goodbye

00:14:25.779 --> 00:14:27.080
Good heavens

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.220
I'm exhausted

00:14:29.899 --> 00:14:30.500
How did it go?

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.419
Any feedback after the broadcast?

00:14:32.679 --> 00:14:34.580
The feedback is overwhelming.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.059
Everyone is rushing to visit.

00:14:36.179 --> 00:14:37.960
They want to see what we said in the ad,

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:38.960
if it's actually true.

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:40.840
What do we do?

00:14:41.039 --> 00:14:42.960
Then we have to really let them see it.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.019
Here, go gather all the seniors.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:47.539
We must let everyone

00:14:47.539 --> 00:14:48.860
know the importance of this matter.

00:14:49.179 --> 00:14:50.779
Director Chang, we heard

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.059
we opened a new Ba-something

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:54.799
International Retirement Community.

00:14:54.799 --> 00:14:55.059
Right.

00:14:55.059 --> 00:14:56.080
When do we move there?

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.379
Please sit down first.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.879
No need to move.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.399
We don't mind the trouble.

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:01.879
Just get a bus for us.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.000
No need for a bus.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.700
Just stay right here and relax.

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.639
Haven't we been staying put?

00:15:06.779 --> 00:15:09.360
Such a high-end new community,

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.480
how can we not be excited?

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:12.580
Yeah.

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.200
Construction riding a thousand-mile horse,

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.399
one day equals twenty years.

00:15:15.799 --> 00:15:16.480
Don't get excited yet.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:16.940
I...

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:18.399
didn't get on.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:19.860
Even with a bus, you can't move.

00:15:19.899 --> 00:15:20.779
Why?

00:15:21.519 --> 00:15:22.039
Because

00:15:23.919 --> 00:15:24.960
there's nowhere to move to.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.580
Isn't there that

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.299
International Retirement Community?

00:15:29.379 --> 00:15:30.879
The Bavaria one?

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.019
Yes.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:32.679
Well,

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.039
this Bavaria...

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.600
translated, it just means

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.220
Willow New Town.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.340
Then why change the name blindly?

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.919
Isn't Willow New Town fine?

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:42.159
Exactly.

00:15:42.159 --> 00:15:42.940
I was just saying, that

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.120
Einstein from the University of Cologne

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.240
looked like Rudy.

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:45.879
Yes.

00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:49.059
That was indeed played by Mr. Kraut.

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:49.519
K...

00:15:49.539 --> 00:15:50.659
Is there a real professor?

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:51.259
Yeah.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:52.600
There is,

00:15:52.659 --> 00:15:55.059
but we are still in contact and negotiations.

00:15:55.379 --> 00:15:56.139
Then this...

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:56.940
You're...

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.679
isn't this false advertising?

00:15:58.679 --> 00:15:59.659
Yes, false.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:00.519
It's a scam.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:01.259
Right.

00:16:01.379 --> 00:16:04.340
Director Chang, how could you do this?

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:05.259
Uncles and Aunties,

00:16:05.259 --> 00:16:06.360
listen to my explanation.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.940
This... well, this kind of thing,

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.519
it doesn't align with

00:16:10.519 --> 00:16:11.980
my own moral standards either.

00:16:12.059 --> 00:16:13.200
But right now, this

00:16:14.159 --> 00:16:16.600
the market competition is just too fierce.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.580
Ever since that Alps Retirement Community

00:16:20.159 --> 00:16:20.840
opened up,

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.120
too many seniors have flocked over there.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:25.820
Even Aunt Luo went over.

00:16:26.799 --> 00:16:27.440
Then you...

00:16:28.059 --> 00:16:29.159
you tell me,

00:16:30.019 --> 00:16:31.159
what should we do?

00:16:31.559 --> 00:16:32.279
Then you should...

00:16:34.679 --> 00:16:35.360
What should we do?

00:16:35.759 --> 00:16:36.340
Yeah, what do we do?

00:16:36.419 --> 00:16:37.840
What to do?

00:16:37.919 --> 00:16:38.659
So...

00:16:39.259 --> 00:16:40.139
We decided...

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:41.559
To accept the challenge.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:42.639
And brave the difficulties.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:43.919
We decided...

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:45.820
For Willow New Town...

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:48.179
To carry out a real, genuine upgrade.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:49.539
That means...

00:16:49.539 --> 00:16:51.000
We're really doing international cooperation.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.039
Exactly.

00:16:52.659 --> 00:16:53.460
Actually...

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.279
I have entrusted Mr. Kraut...

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.159
To actively partner with the German side.

00:16:57.919 --> 00:16:58.879
To truly...

00:16:58.879 --> 00:16:59.559
Take the foreign...

00:16:59.639 --> 00:17:01.659
Advanced retirement community concepts...

00:17:01.899 --> 00:17:03.019
And bring them here to us.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.220
To give everyone truly top-notch service.

00:17:06.039 --> 00:17:06.799
If...

00:17:07.059 --> 00:17:08.019
If that's the case...

00:17:08.019 --> 00:17:09.859
I think this is a good thing.

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:11.940
However...

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:14.880
This still requires...

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:15.980
All you elders...

00:17:16.299 --> 00:17:17.940
To cooperate with our work a bit.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:19.980
I wonder what you all think?

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:20.519
No...

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:21.680
Such a good thing...

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.220
We can't just stand by.

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:23.660
Right.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:24.480
Yeah. Tell us...

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.859
How should we cooperate? Right.

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:28.000
It's very simple.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:29.180
We just need...

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.240
All of you...

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.920
The veteran elders of Willow New Town...

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.319
When our new seniors...

00:17:35.319 --> 00:17:37.160
Come to visit our community...

00:17:38.319 --> 00:17:39.180
To slightly and intentionally...

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.079
Show off the happy life here.

00:17:41.079 --> 00:17:41.779
That will do.

00:17:42.119 --> 00:17:42.759
When necessary...

00:17:42.759 --> 00:17:45.380
A little bit of exaggeration is fine.

00:17:46.279 --> 00:17:46.740
Just...

00:17:46.839 --> 00:17:47.720
I promise...

00:17:48.359 --> 00:17:49.619
As long as everyone...

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:51.359
Cooperates with our tour...

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.559
Lunch for a week...

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:55.539
Will be completely free.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.059
Just free lunch?

00:17:59.140 --> 00:17:59.819
This is...

00:17:59.859 --> 00:18:00.920
A fee for living ads.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:01.599
Exactly. Yeah.

00:18:01.839 --> 00:18:02.579
Old leader...

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:04.500
So what you mean is...

00:18:04.519 --> 00:18:05.960
I think at the very least...

00:18:07.099 --> 00:18:08.819
Dinner should be free too.

00:18:10.079 --> 00:18:10.619
Fine.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:12.319
I'll make the call.

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:13.700
As long as you all...

00:18:13.799 --> 00:18:15.319
Cooperate with our tour...

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.180
Three meals a day for this week...

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.099
Are all free.

00:18:22.539 --> 00:18:24.180
Over here, we often have seniors

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:25.839
playing the piano and such.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:26.579
This person here...

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.579
this is the famous actress Liu Minzhi.

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:30.500
You all recognize her, right?

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:32.700
She is...

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:33.819
Hello.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:35.019
Don't know her.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.000
At your age,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.180
you must have seen the movie *Flowers of the Motherland*.

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:40.420
Yes.

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:41.160
Seen it.

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:42.240
I remember now.

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.559
She played the teacher, right?

00:18:44.619 --> 00:18:45.619
No.

00:18:45.619 --> 00:18:47.220
She was that cute little girl,

00:18:47.279 --> 00:18:47.799
Huahua.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.700
Huahua has gotten this old?

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:52.180
Well, obviously.

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.880
That movie is fifty years old.

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.140
I forgot about that part.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:58.380
Then she doesn't look old at all.

00:18:58.519 --> 00:18:59.980
She looks positively young!

00:19:00.519 --> 00:19:01.400
Grandma Liu here,

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.640
after carefully comparing

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.119
nearly a hundred nursing homes,

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:06.960
finally chose our Willow New Town.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.839
She plays the piano quite well, too.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.960
When Grandma Liu first arrived,

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.240
she couldn't play at all.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:15.559
But,

00:19:15.759 --> 00:19:17.519
after studying here for three months,

00:19:17.519 --> 00:19:18.740
she plays this well.

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.240
You teach that well here?

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.099
I want to learn piano too.

00:19:23.099 --> 00:19:23.720
It's decided.

00:19:23.859 --> 00:19:24.839
I'm picking this place.

00:19:25.519 --> 00:19:26.960
See this gentleman?

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.099
Before he came to our place,

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:30.980
the doctors had already given him a death sentence.

00:19:31.019 --> 00:19:32.000
The doctors said,

00:19:32.059 --> 00:19:33.759
"Just eat whatever you like, and that's it."

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:36.259
Uncle Li, not wanting to burden his family,

00:19:36.339 --> 00:19:38.220
compared nearly a hundred nursing homes,

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:39.480
and finally chose us.

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:40.779
And guess what?

00:19:41.259 --> 00:19:42.900
Oh my, a miracle happened!

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:44.559
Thanks to German specialists

00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:45.380
and our traditional medicine doctors'

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.960
careful treatment,

00:19:47.039 --> 00:19:48.099
look at his physique now.

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.400
Gosh, just like a twenty-year-old!

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.960
He does a hundred push-ups a day like it's nothing.

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.059
How many?

00:19:54.099 --> 00:19:55.579
A day, not at once.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:56.779
Twenty at a time, right?

00:19:56.779 --> 00:19:57.619
Five times a day.

00:19:57.619 --> 00:19:58.640
That makes exactly one hundred a day.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.799
Hello, Uncle Li.

00:20:01.079 --> 00:20:01.599
Hello.

00:20:02.019 --> 00:20:02.799
So tired.

00:20:03.859 --> 00:20:04.880
Don't tease us.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.680
Play along, meals are free.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.119
Now,

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:09.359
let's invite Uncle Li

00:20:09.359 --> 00:20:11.119
to do twenty push-ups for everyone.

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:11.779
How about that?

00:20:11.859 --> 00:20:12.640
Great!

00:20:13.279 --> 00:20:14.220
I just...

00:20:14.279 --> 00:20:15.640
Where is the applause?

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.140
Right here!

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:16.759
Okay.

00:20:19.359 --> 00:20:20.859
I'm playing along...

00:20:22.119 --> 00:20:23.039
I...

00:20:28.559 --> 00:20:29.400
Grandpas, Grandmas

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:29.960
Here,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.920
is our featured senior activity center.

00:20:32.019 --> 00:20:33.660
The seniors usually stay here,

00:20:33.799 --> 00:20:35.259
playing chess, reading books,

00:20:36.059 --> 00:20:38.599
spending their very rich twilight years.

00:20:39.079 --> 00:20:41.299
That one is reading an English book.

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:42.759
Impressive.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:44.319
Must be a professor.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.539
No, Grandpa.

00:20:45.579 --> 00:20:46.599
Listen to me.

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.039
This Grandpa Fan,

00:20:48.039 --> 00:20:49.240
was originally just an

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.480
ordinary laid-off worker.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:52.880
Yi Zhoufan.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:54.559
He,

00:20:54.619 --> 00:20:57.180
after comparing nearly a hundred retirement communities,

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:57.900
finally

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:58.940
chose us,

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:01.700
Bavaria International Retirement Community.

00:21:02.259 --> 00:21:02.900
And,

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:03.960
after coming here,

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.140
he attended our featured Senior University.

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.000
In less than a year,

00:21:08.059 --> 00:21:09.619
he could read English newspapers,

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.140
communicate in English.

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:11.819
Hello.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:12.460
Hello.

00:21:13.019 --> 00:21:13.640
Even,

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:15.319
he goes to the university to teach classes when free.

00:21:15.599 --> 00:21:16.220
This is...

00:21:16.319 --> 00:21:17.180
Really?

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.519
Of course it's true.

00:21:18.579 --> 00:21:20.059
Grandpa, if you don't believe it,

00:21:20.059 --> 00:21:21.420
ask our Grandpa Fan yourself.

00:21:22.279 --> 00:21:23.000
Old brother,

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.720
I heard you often go to the university to lecture?

00:21:25.819 --> 00:21:26.279
Yes.

00:21:27.059 --> 00:21:27.539
Mainly to

00:21:27.539 --> 00:21:29.000
guide my graduate class.

00:21:29.579 --> 00:21:30.700
It really is true.

00:21:30.819 --> 00:21:31.819
That's amazing.

00:21:32.059 --> 00:21:33.380
Let me tell everyone,

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:34.339
the Senior University

00:21:34.339 --> 00:21:36.319
is our Bavaria's feature.

00:21:36.319 --> 00:21:37.299
Here with us,

00:21:37.339 --> 00:21:38.720
there's only what you can't imagine,

00:21:38.779 --> 00:21:40.039
nothing we can't do.

00:21:40.119 --> 00:21:41.299
If you learn well,

00:21:41.339 --> 00:21:43.200
you can really go study abroad in Bavaria.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.319
At our age,

00:21:45.779 --> 00:21:47.759
do they still accept us?

00:21:47.799 --> 00:21:49.140
Of course they do.

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:50.619
Grandma, let me tell you,

00:21:50.819 --> 00:21:51.859
University of Bremen,

00:21:52.099 --> 00:21:54.380
the oldest graduate was ninety-six.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.039
I see you have at least twenty years left.

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:58.259
Twenty years,

00:21:58.319 --> 00:22:00.960
you could go from primary school to post-doc.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.480
Makes sense.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:03.880
Then I

00:22:04.079 --> 00:22:05.599
will settle here.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.480
I

00:22:07.539 --> 00:22:09.900
want to go to university.

00:22:11.339 --> 00:22:13.539
Our Bavaria International Retirement Community,

00:22:13.599 --> 00:22:14.660
another one of our features

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:17.299
is the German multi-generational living model.

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:19.660
Young people and elderly people live together.

00:22:19.859 --> 00:22:21.880
Young people can save on living costs,

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:23.140
elderly people can keep up with

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:24.519
the pace of social life.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.079
For example, this Grandma,

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.319
she,

00:22:29.319 --> 00:22:30.079
after comparing

00:22:30.079 --> 00:22:31.900
nearly a hundred nursing institutions,

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.460
finally chose us.

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:35.839
Look, everyone,

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:37.740
she's over eighty years old.

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:38.720
She looks so young!

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.319
Eighty.

00:22:41.859 --> 00:22:43.000
You can't tell at all

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.079
You look like...

00:22:44.259 --> 00:22:45.960
You're just over sixty

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:47.799
You see, my family's youngsters live with me

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:49.400
But they never include me in anything

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.619
Isn't this Little Cai?

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:54.140
No way you're eighty

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:54.779
You...

00:22:54.779 --> 00:22:55.559
Do you know each other?

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:58.839
Do you remember me?

00:23:00.859 --> 00:23:01.680
You are...

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.920
I'm Wang Qiang

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.400
Wang Qiang

00:23:05.519 --> 00:23:06.539
Which Wang Qiang?

00:23:07.619 --> 00:23:10.140
You were the matchmaker for me and my wife

00:23:10.359 --> 00:23:11.339
Do you remember now?

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:13.279
No

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.000
I...

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.019
I've matchmade over twenty Wang Qiangs

00:23:16.019 --> 00:23:17.240
How am I supposed to remember?

00:23:17.279 --> 00:23:17.720
Say...

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.000
Your wife...

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:20.259
Is she doing well?

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.720
Doing well? Hardly

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.920
We fought our whole lives

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.799
She carelessly passed away last year

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:27.140
You mean she...

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.380
Unfortunately passed away?

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.339
No, it was carelessly

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:30.519
She didn't watch where she was going

00:23:30.519 --> 00:23:32.519
Slipped into a ditch and got washed away

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.700
That really was careless

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:35.539
Come

00:23:35.819 --> 00:23:37.059
It's no problem

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.319
As long as you...

00:23:38.319 --> 00:23:39.819
Move in here with us

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:40.740
I guarantee...

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:43.099
I'll find you someone who doesn't fight right away

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:45.039
That's great!

00:23:45.039 --> 00:23:46.559
How about introducing one to me too?

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.740
Even though mine hasn't been washed away yet

00:23:49.019 --> 00:23:49.779
Sure

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:50.579
Shoo!

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:51.819
You old rascal

00:23:57.839 --> 00:23:58.819
I'm exhausted

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:01.839
After a whole day of this...

00:24:02.819 --> 00:24:04.579
Every time a group came, I did a set

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:07.940
I did over a hundred push-ups today

00:24:10.059 --> 00:24:10.900
Same here

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:12.599
My old back is killing me

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.839
Played piano all day, can't lift my arms

00:24:16.259 --> 00:24:18.420
I sat and read books all day

00:24:18.779 --> 00:24:19.400
That's tiring too

00:24:19.539 --> 00:24:20.559
It tires the brain

00:24:21.519 --> 00:24:22.059
My...

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.700
Why can't I stop shaking?

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:25.220
Dinner is served!

00:24:25.339 --> 00:24:26.779
Grandpas and Grandmas, time to eat

00:24:26.779 --> 00:24:27.779
Let's go eat

00:24:29.279 --> 00:24:30.039
I'm not eating

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.160
If I eat, I'll have to do push-ups tomorrow

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:34.839
Right

00:24:35.359 --> 00:24:36.799
No appetite, I can't eat

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.079
It's free!

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.480
Actually, Willow New Town is still better

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:45.460
Right?

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.900
No need to fake things

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:49.539
go for some German concept

00:24:49.599 --> 00:24:50.759
or a Swiss model

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:52.940
Breaking news

00:24:53.839 --> 00:24:55.460
Alps International Nursing Home...

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:56.759
Due to false advertising...

00:24:56.819 --> 00:24:58.059
Has been penalized

00:24:59.000 --> 00:24:59.380
This...

00:25:00.339 --> 00:25:01.700
Alps International...

00:25:03.559 --> 00:25:04.220
Yusheng!

00:25:05.019 --> 00:25:05.779
Yusheng!

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.000
Quick!

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:07.799
Go quickly and...

00:25:07.799 --> 00:25:08.700
Take the video down

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:09.380
Quick, take down the video!

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:09.779
Take down the video!

00:25:09.779 --> 00:25:10.480
Hurry!

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.279
I'm on it right now

00:25:15.819 --> 00:25:17.160
I take full responsibility for this

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:17.940
I...

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:18.619
I shouldn't have

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.240
during their cutthroat competition

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.240
just gone with the flow

00:25:21.579 --> 00:25:22.380
Uncles and Aunties...

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:23.940
I've let you all down

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:26.660
It also taught us students a lesson

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.559
We can't cut corners in what we do

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:30.420
Director

00:25:31.279 --> 00:25:32.059
Chang

00:25:32.519 --> 00:25:33.680
Just call me Little Chang

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.440
Are you...

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:38.019
coming back?

00:25:38.519 --> 00:25:39.220
Can we?

00:25:40.279 --> 00:25:41.180
Welcome home
