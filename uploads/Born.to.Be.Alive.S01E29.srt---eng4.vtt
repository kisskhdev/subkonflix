[Born to Be Alive]

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.229
[Episode 29]

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:44.570
Didn't you say

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.520
you'd finish the search last year?

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.820
I'm just afraid that
if I finish searching this year...

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:54.590
I won't know

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.420
what to do with myself next year.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.640
Five stages of grief.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.510
When people experience grief,

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.590
they go through five stages.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.460
Denial,

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.180
anger,

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.180
bargaining,

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:23.470
de...

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.620
De...

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:26.670
Depression.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.720
Acceptance.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.320
First comes

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.860
denial.

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:34.590
Then anger.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.500
Then bargaining begins.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.840
Then

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.020
comes depression.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.329
Finally, with no choice,

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:43.400
you accept it.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.130
Of course, some people

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:47.800
will cycle between

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.000
certain stages.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.710
And, of course,

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.370
there are also people like Han

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.210
who get stuck in a certain stage

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.190
and need a long time

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.200
to move on.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.150
Han,

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.870
Bai Ji said

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.460
this is aged baijiu.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.640
You're wasting it by drinking like that...

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.030
People like you,

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.890
who've already gone through
all five stages,

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.150
wouldn't understand!

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.080
Bai,

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.930
actually...

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.060
you haven't gone through
all the stages either.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:18.500
I know.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.550
Cheers.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.160
Seriously, this won't work,

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.310
that won't work—

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.410
only booze works.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.370
Drink up. Drink.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.120
Good liquor or bad liquor...

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.500
I really can't tell the difference.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.620
Dongzhiba always said
alcohol tasted awful.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.180
So every time I drink a new one,

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.600
I want him to try it too...

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.160
and ask him if it's any good.

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.160
And... and He.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.000
The gunman who killed him

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.870
still hasn't been caught.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.150
I thought

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.840
once the Forestry Police was established

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.850
and the Mountain Patrol was disbanded,

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.690
I'd be the first to go.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.420
Now the Captain

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.360
and the Deputy Captain

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:26.650
are both gone.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:38.620
Bai.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:41.880
I just caused a scene

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:42.840
at the coal mine,

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.190
and you arrested me

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.500
like I was your enemy.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.130
Tell me,

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:53.820
are you still my friend or not?

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.840
Wipe it off yourself with your clothes.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.880
Where are you wiping?

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.020
You drunk or what?

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:05.340
Come here. Come on.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.470
I'll wipe it for you.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.590
Shao,

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.250
you're a piece of work.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.000
It's so hard for Bai Ju
to raise the child alone.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.380
What kind of father

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.550
are you?

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.100
If we'd known you two wouldn't work out,

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.630
why did we all

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.770
bother setting you up?

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:25.540
Alright.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.630
Here's the thing.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.190
I'm...

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.760
getting a promotion soon.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.250
After that, I'll

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.420
spend more time

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.450
with the kid.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.159
Next year, I'll take Zhuling

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:41.610
to the provincial capital for school.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:42.700
Bai Ju will go too.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.420
Really?

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.830
That depends on his behavior.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.230
You're all my witnesses.

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:50.060
Help me keep an eye on him.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.870
Heard that?

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.620
Good.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.230
Good.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.630
You guys just move on.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:06.280
With us here,

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.440
we'll hold the fort.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.660
Just move on!

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:11.980
Go without worry!

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.720
Crying again?

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.210
Han, give it a rest.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.420
And you.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.400
Look at you!

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:21.690
What's wrong with me?

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:22.680
You know what's wrong with you!

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.450
I'm just minding my own business,

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:24.480
running my supermarket.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.430
If we're talking about
environmental protection,

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:26.560
I'm the most eco-friendly one here.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.060
I even volunteer for it.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.120
You're the worst friend!

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:34.950
You won't even drink with us!

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:35.900
Drink it.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.180
Han, Han!

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.860
Han!

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.810
Ever since Sangba

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.270
had heart surgery,

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.540
his wife hasn't let him drink.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.050
He has to be careful.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.010
I think you're the worst friend.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.100
Shut up, you!

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.690
You're the one who benefits the most!

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:49.720
What did I do?

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.600
What did you do?

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.190
You've got money.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:53.830
You're the richest one here.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:54.720
Big shot.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.370
Driving that big truck!

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.659
Alright, alright!

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.320
Then come herd the yaks for me,

00:06:59.320 --> 00:06:59.820
okay?

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.540
I'm not going to work for you!

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.170
I won't work for anyone!

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:07.370
I'm just a loser.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.250
I can't do anything.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.800
All I've got is a foul mouth.

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.070
I'll rip this foul mouth of mine off!

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.510
Alright, alright!

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.160
I'll help you rip it off.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.780
You can't do it yourself.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.410
I'll help you.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.920
I'll rip yours first!

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.090
They're fighting.

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:29.660
Rip it!

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:30.420
What a fight!

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.300
Rip!

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:32.390
Look at this fight.

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:58.420
This is reporter Shao Yunfei,

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.160
reporting live from the scene.

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:30.070
She's asleep?

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:31.690
Yeah.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.700
Well, I'll be off then.

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:39.890
Tomorrow at 8 AM,

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.090
I'll come pick you up.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.409
Take that suitcase

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:44.480
to the car first.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:45.120
Okay.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.170
It's been a long time

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:55.650
since I tucked her in

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:56.820
like this.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:58.220
I thought...

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:03.460
Thank you.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.360
See you tomorrow.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.840
See you tomorrow.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:31.630
Chun.

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:34.770
Got time tonight to come home?

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.630
You're leaving?

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:45.880
I just got Zhuling to sleep.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.470
Then I... I'll...

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:00.320
Shao Yunfei.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:03.670
You and Bai Ju

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.600
have been divorced for many years.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.490
Even though you're Zhuling's father,

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:09.420
we are two families now, after all.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.160
Our family doesn't do this

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.250
"divorced but still hanging around" thing.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:12.790
Chun,

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.600
I...

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:16.650
I'll always treat you

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:17.680
as family.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.800
That will never change.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:20.530
Shao Yunfei,

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.630
I'm going to be blunt today.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:23.750
We all know

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.770
you still want to
get back together with Ju.

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:26.930
But ask yourself honestly,

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:28.010
have you ever really been a good husband

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:28.940
or a good father?

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:29.980
Chun,

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:30.930
this time, I...

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:32.590
We're not that close anymore.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.120
When you two first started dating,

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.020
I asked you

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:37.910
about your plans for the future.

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:38.930
You said you didn't dare

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:40.340
to think that far ahead yet.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.120
Yes, yes.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:42.470
I was young then.

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:42.870
But

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:44.000
I've thought it all through

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:44.690
very clearly now.

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:46.220
You don't need to answer me.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.040
Because the past few years

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.610
have already given me the answer.

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:54.020
You come from a good background.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.750
It's still considered good
by today's standards.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:57.940
You're from an educated family

00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.160
and have a job in the provincial capital.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.510
If it weren't for the Mountain Patrol,

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:01.740
you, Bai Ju, and our family

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:02.700
would've been from two different worlds.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:03.410
We wouldn't have

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:04.270
crossed paths.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:05.790
Our family really
reached above our station.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.020
Chun, you... no...

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:08.410
Bai Chun, don't say that.

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:10.670
But our family doesn't owe you anything.

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:13.200
Bai Ju has her hang-ups,
and she can be stubborn.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.150
But when you met her,

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:15.610
she was already like that.

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:17.460
All these years,

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:18.960
she's been raising the kid by herself,

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:19.550
while you've been running

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:21.320
all over the country chasing news stories.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.640
When Zhuling had a fever,

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.100
she was so worried

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.250
she called me in the middle of the night.

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:25.860
I rushed back from the mine overnight

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:26.290
and stayed at the hospital

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:27.530
all night with them.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.320
Every time

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:29.740
they

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:31.010
needed you the most,

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:32.090
you weren't there.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.010
Yes.

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:36.450
That's why...

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:38.890
I want to do my best

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:40.220
to make it up to them now.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:42.510
I'll devote all my time

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:43.530
to making it up to them.

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:44.990
You are Zhuling's father.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.290
Anything you do to make it up to her

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:47.360
could never be too much.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.500
But as for Bai Ju,

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:50.100
I advise you

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.100
to give up on getting back together.

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:53.890
As the eldest brother of the Bai family,

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:55.290
I won't accept you again.

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:01.050
Bai Chun,

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:04.130
you might have misunderstood me.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.170
I love Bai Ju deeply.

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:07.020
I always have.

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:09.090
The divorce back then

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:09.990
wasn't my idea.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.020
You don't need to explain to me.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:11.960
Yeah, when a man explains too much,

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:12.820
it's pathetic.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.090
But I think in a relationship,

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:14.650
feeling indebted to each other

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.050
isn't really a bad thing.

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:17.770
As long as both partners are willing,

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:18.240
others

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:19.150
actually don't have the right

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:20.610
to judge or point fingers.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:23.190
What do you mean by that?

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:24.460
You know what I mean.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.250
Dad.

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:40.120
You promised

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.980
you'd ride the drop tower with me!

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.770
Your mom will ride with you.

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:45.860
How can you go back on your word?

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.150
We had a deal!

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.270
The deal was
that your mom would ride with you.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.220
You'll ride with me.

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:51.020
Your mom will.

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:51.800
You!

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:52.690
Your mother...

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.360
Hey, language.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.020
How old

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:57.130
are you two?

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:01.670
Boring adult.

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.260
Let's ignore her.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:04.290
Watch out.

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:04.890
Here we go.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.260
You even prepared disposable slippers?

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:10.660
Hello?

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.090
I even prepared fruit

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:13.800
and forks.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.570
There's a blanket in the back too.

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:16.090
Dad,

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:17.180
you're the best.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:18.860
It's just

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.010
that I don't really like these fruits.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.490
Can I ask you for a favor?

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:26.770
How about you sit in the back?

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:28.600
You see,

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:30.280
big shots and such

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:31.900
all sit in the back.

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.820
Only secretaries and assistants

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.220
take the passenger seat.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.150
Dad,

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:36.320
these fruits

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.080
weren't actually for me, were they?

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.340
Of course they were.

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:41.220
Look at the bag of snacks in the back.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.420
Those are all for you.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:43.870
Okay?

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.800
I'll reluctantly

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:47.790
play along with you.

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:48.970
You're so good. Come here.

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:51.080
Please get in the car, baby.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:51.880
Sit tight.

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:53.110
I'm closing the door.

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:56.190
All set. We can go now.

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:09.510
What's wrong?

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.410
Han found a body.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:16.380
We...

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:19.950
might have found the Captain.

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:26.510
I found the body!

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:27.410
Why won't you let us in?

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:28.570
We're processing the scene.

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:29.890
Please cooperate with us!

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:30.570
We're cooperating!

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:31.740
Just let us go in and take a look!

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:32.030
Yeah!

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:32.790
We're familiar with
the situation back then!

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:33.220
We can help!

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:33.530
I said,

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:34.460
the crime scene is under investigation!

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:35.120
Please cooperate with us

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:35.920
and step back!

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.200
Bai, you're finally here.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:40.600
Bai.

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:41.890
Tell them to let us in!

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:42.630
Yeah, Bai.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:43.630
Wait outside.

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:44.430
I found the body.

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:45.410
Let us in.

Bai.

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:47.100
Step back!

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:48.680
Step back, all of you!

the Chief is out of town

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:50.460
but is rushing back.

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.250
He asked us to have you come

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:51.860
and assist with the investigation

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:53.460
as someone who was involved.

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:30.160
You're here.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:36.700
How is it?

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:32.090
Zhuling is asleep?

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:33.460
Yeah.

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:36.020
She didn't fuss. She was good.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:38.770
Thanks.

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:52.750
Bai Ju.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.040
We found him.

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:13.770
That knife...

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.400
He showed it off to us.

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:24.590
I recognized it immediately.

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:29.530
It's still Dolma's.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.500
Tashi had someone make
a new sheath

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:32.960
with a leather strap for it

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.580
and insisted on giving it to me.

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:35.580
This is nice.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.120
You should've given me something
like this.

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:39.050
What do the words carved on it

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:39.790
mean?

"Gang-ri bzhin."

"As steadfast as a snow-capped mountain."

We've reached some

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.090
preliminary conclusions.

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:04.310
The deceased is male.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.180
Based on the morphological features

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:07.250
of the pubic symphysis

00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:08.720
and cranial suture closure,

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:09.600

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:11.380
the age of the deceased

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:12.440
to be approximately

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.750
between 40 and 45 years old.

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:14.590
The deceased measured

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:16.660
approximately 1.85 meters in height.

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:17.980
Due to individual variations,

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:18.640
there may be a small margin

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.410
of error in the height measurement.

On the left frontal side of the skull,

there is a typical

firearm wound.

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:25.970
The bullet entry hole is circular

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:38.190
About 15 years ago.

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:40.380
Trace elements from the soil

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.260
have already seeped into the bones.

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:44.090
By analyzing these elements,

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:46.260
combined with the overall weathering
of the bones,

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:47.980
we can infer a timeframe.

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:48.750
However, in dry

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:49.840
and cold environments,

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.250
bone changes occur more slowly,

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.250
so the estimated time of death

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:54.450
may appear shorter than it actually is.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.640
What's the possible margin of error?

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:57.890
Two to three years.

00:20:58.640 --> 00:20:59.240
In other words,

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.590
the time of death could be

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:02.380
15 to 18 years ago.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:02.950
Yes.

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:04.000
Okay.

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:05.600
Doesn't that

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:06.650
[Xie Yang, Captain of
the Criminal Investigation Detachment,]

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:06.770
line up with Duojie's disappearance

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:07.470
[Tianduo Municipal Public Security Bureau]

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:08.130
perfectly?

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:17.090
What about the forensic analysis?

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:18.440
Most of the clothing on the remains

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:19.660
has decomposed.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:21.000
At the scene, we recovered

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:21.530
a bullet,

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:22.770
caliber 7.62 mm.

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:24.180
The lab is currently

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:25.740
testing other physical evidence

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:26.780
that was retrieved.

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:27.320
Okay.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.350
Everyone, as you all know,

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:32.680
these skeletal remains

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:33.980
are related to

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.430
a missing person case

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:36.460
from 17 years ago.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:38.660
Our top priority right now

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:39.640
is to confirm

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:41.090
the identity of the body.

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:42.880
Get the DNA extraction done immediately.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:43.560
Also,

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:45.030
run DNA comparisons against the database

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:46.920
for missing persons

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:48.500
and fugitives

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:50.380
at the same time.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.160
Don't limit

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:52.180
the investigation

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:53.250
to just this one case.

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:53.980
Understood.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:54.640
Everyone,

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.380
given the special nature

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:57.240
of this case,

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:58.670
the Municipal Bureau has decided

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:00.270
to form a special task force.

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:02.130
We will mobilize the entire bureau

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:03.990
to thoroughly investigate this!

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.590
Xie Yang, after the meeting,

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:07.920
come to my office.

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:09.060
Submit

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:10.460
a personnel list for the task force

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:12.160
and assign tasks as soon as possible.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:12.690
Yes, sir.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:16.070
Chief.

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:20.110
I request to join the task force.

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:21.630
Don't even think about it.

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:23.840
You're with the Public Security Brigade.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:24.680
Meddling in such a high-level

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.200
criminal case—

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.400
does that make sense?

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.380
I was personally involved in

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:28.780
what happened back then.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.790
I have both the qualifications

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:30.790
and the responsibility to assist.

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:31.380
Chief.

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:33.190
Besides,

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:34.510
our brigade reported this case.

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:35.640
Han Xuechao has been investigating it

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:36.590
for 17 years.

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:38.620
I owe everyone an explanation.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.240
I understand

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.240
how you feel.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.330
Duojie was my former superior too.

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:43.640
But according to recusal regulations,

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:44.200
you cannot participate

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.130
in this case.

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:46.380
Don't you know that?

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Recuse from what?

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.790
The identity of the remains

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:51.140
hasn't even been confirmed yet.

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:52.990
Who am I supposed to recuse myself from?

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:53.610
Don't

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.640
split hairs here.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:56.800
You know the regulations.

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.040
Go back and do your job properly.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.300
Our brigade's duties—

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:01.700
cracking down on gambling, prostitution,
and drugs,

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:02.900
covering security for large events,

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:03.960
conducting public venue inspections,

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.570
and managing canine control.

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:06.810
Captain Xiao can handle all of those

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:07.440
with the team.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.700
They don't need me.

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:12.140
What's with your attitude?

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:13.970
Is this how you

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.200
treat your work?

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:17.460
If I had known,

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:18.140
I wouldn't have

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.530
transferred you to the Municipal Bureau.

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:20.330
I should've left you in the county

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:22.380
managing household registrations.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:23.370
That's not what I mean.

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:24.110
I mean...

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.130
compared to those routine duties,

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:28.400
Captain Duojie's case

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.730
needs me more right now.

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:31.230
See?

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.580
That's exactly the problem.

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:40.920
"Captain Duojie."

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:44.500
Bai,

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:46.450
I trust

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:47.870
your professionalism,

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.680
but I'm not sure

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:52.240
how much personal emotion
you'll bring into this case.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:52.710
When it

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:53.900
comes to this case,

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:56.210
you can't be both a police officer

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:57.610
and a member of the Mountain Patrol.

00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:58.810
I'm a police officer.

00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:01.120
I know that better than anyone.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:02.790
Chief,

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:04.580
please rest assured.

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:06.900
Chief, you...

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:08.910
Wait outside for a moment.

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:09.720
Okay.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.050
Chief.

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.180
I've waited so many years.

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:19.220
This is the day I've been waiting for.

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:20.200
I recognize that knife.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.200
I was involved.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:22.960
I can definitely help

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.400
with the investigation.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.840
Didn't I tell you to wait?

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:29.390
Mayor Lin.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:30.470
Mayor Lin.

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:31.780
Shi,

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:33.560
I picked someone up for you.

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:39.990
Chief Shi Long.

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:44.000
You're back.

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:49.460
Ju,

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:51.700
how have you been?

00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:57.380
Ju, take a photo

00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:58.140
for me.

00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:59.450
Okay.

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:15.590
That's right.

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:18.930
This is the knife.

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:24.400
"Gang-ri bzhin."

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:28.100
When I carved it,

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:29.120
I thought Dad

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.250
was that kind of man.

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:38.640
Actually...

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:41.630
I was prepared for this.

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:45.360
If Dad were still alive,

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:47.850
he wouldn't have abandoned us

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:49.510
and disappeared for 17 years.

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:53.680
Does Cairen

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:54.610
know about this?

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:57.700
When I came,

00:25:58.330 --> 00:25:59.060
I told her

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:03.020
there were some documents
regarding the pasture that needed signing.

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:06.510
Let's wait until the case is closed.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:07.880
After that,

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:09.500
I'll find a chance

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:10.900
to break it to her gently.

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.540
Actually, since Dad went missing,

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:15.380
Mom's health

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:16.600
has been poor.

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:19.890
It's worrying to have her go to

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:21.650
such a high altitude.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.510
I brought Dad's clothes.

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:30.320
I don't know

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:31.460
if you can still extract

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.330
the DNA you need.

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:36.440
But we have to try.

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:39.600
Have these been washed?

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:41.640
Spotless.

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:43.740
Mom said back then,

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:45.640
no matter how far Dad went,

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:46.640
the yak dung at home

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:47.970
must always be burning,

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.040
his clothes must always be clean,

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.030
and the butter lamp

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:52.490
must always be lit for him.

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:53.890
Otherwise...

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:56.530
Dad would be angry when he came back.

00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:58.610
Can we still contact

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:00.220
his other relatives?

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:02.640
All

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:03.720
his blood relatives

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:04.790
have passed away.

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:07.550
I really wish

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:09.810
I were his biological child.

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:21.780
Chief.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.260
Please let me join the task force.

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:27.310
We'll talk about this

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:28.330
later.

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.330
Since Mayor Lin,

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:29.760
Captain Xie,

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.020
and Tashi are all here,

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:32.530
I promise you—

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:33.830
I won't

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:36.290
let my personal emotions
influence my work.

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:38.290
Before Duojie went missing,

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:39.850
I had the most contact with him,

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:40.310
and I'm also familiar with

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:42.240
his social connections back then.

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:43.090
I can provide more assistance

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:44.460
to the investigation.

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:46.310
It'll only benefit the case.

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:52.140
The case is special.

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:53.460
We do need someone

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:55.140
who understands what happened back then

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:56.140
on the task force.

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:57.290
Besides,

00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:59.520
a cross-departmental task force

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:00.420
can integrate resources

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:01.400
and expertise

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:02.550
from all sides.

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:05.140
I think it's okay.

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:07.090
Chief.

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:09.380
I agree with Mayor Lin.

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.330
Regarding what happened back then,

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:12.000
the task force

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:12.640
intends to interview

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:13.840
relevant witnesses.

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:15.960
Having Bai Ju on the case

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:17.520
will help.

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:23.420
Don't get emotional.

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:26.140
If you violate any rules or discipline,

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:28.050
go straight back to
the Public Security Brigade.

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:28.580
Yes, sir.

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:30.510
Chief,

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:32.030
I now request

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:33.350
the transfer

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:34.920
of all relevant case files

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:37.680
from
the Mazhi County Public Security Bureau.

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:48.920
Lin!

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:50.140
Look.

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:51.940
Jianshe bought this for me.

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:52.870
It's quite nice.

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:55.510
Just a bit loose around the waist.

00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:57.460
That kid...

00:28:58.510 --> 00:28:59.780
He doesn't even know

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:00.860
his mother's size.

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:04.490
It's good enough.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:05.930
Our Jianshe

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.570
is thoughtful enough.

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:10.260
The watch he bought you—

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:11.790
I haven't seen you wear it once.

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:12.660
Can't bear to?

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.860
The brand's too fancy.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:16.530
That's true.

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:18.880
Next time,

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:19.750
let him buy you

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:20.750
a cheaper one.

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:21.570
Then you can wear it out.

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:22.500
If people ask,

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:22.920
just say,

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:23.720
"My son bought this for me."

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.470
Tashi came to Tianduo today.

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:31.460
Duojie's Tashi?

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:37.990
Tashi...

00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:39.930
must be over 30 by now, right?

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:41.060
Has he changed much?

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:45.240
He's quieter

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:47.600
and more steady.

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:51.350
Not like Duojie.

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:54.540
He's more like Cairen.

00:29:58.380 --> 00:29:59.070
Invite the kid over

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:00.330
for dinner next time.

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:02.130
Haven't seen him in years.

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:09.760
At least now...

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:13.090
we can get the truth about the case.

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:16.850
What?

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.510
All these years,

00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:21.010
even if you never said it,

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.200
I know.

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:26.640
Neither of us believes

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.960
Duojie would run away
to escape punishment.

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:29.760
Now,

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:31.790
at least we can clear his name.

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:35.950
Can he be considered a martyr?

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:37.790
He contributed to

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:39.250
the establishment of the reserve.

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:40.400
The police

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.850
have to

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.540
find the killer first, right?

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:44.830
The body's identity

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:45.770
hasn't even been confirmed yet.

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:46.250
Can you stop

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:47.830
jumping to conclusions?

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:51.310
How am I jumping to conclusions?

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.800
You're using that official tone with me
at home?

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:04.130
Do you know

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.050
you reek of cigarettes when you get home?

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:07.770
You quit smoking years ago.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:09.850
These past few days,

00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:11.200
you even

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:12.890
sigh in your sleep.

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:16.230
Deep down,

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:17.680
you already have the answer.

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:18.170
I just

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:19.270
said it out loud.

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:45.280
Chairman,

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:46.740
you wanted to see me?

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:47.450
Sit.

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:49.220
Have some tea first.

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:00.860
When it comes to Pu'er,

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:02.270
the older, the better.

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:03.490
I just got this.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.250
Over the last few days,

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:20.580
I visited a few pastures

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:22.600
and finalized all the contracts.

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:23.570
I haven't had a chance

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:24.700
to report to you yet.

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:27.860
No rush.

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:30.590
All these years,

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:33.240
I've always

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.520
been confident in your work.

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:38.900
Yaohui,

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:41.190
what year did you come back?

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:44.590
1999.

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:46.010
Right.

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:50.130
The second year
after Xinhai was established.

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:52.750
Back then,

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:54.310
Xinhai only had one mine.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:58.650
In 2000,

00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:00.130
things picked up speed,

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.140
and we opened a few more mines.

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:03.440
I remember

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:06.060
you were still in charge of blasting
back then.

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:07.910
You showed a lot of potential.

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:08.870
In 2008,

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:11.300
you'd already become deputy mine manager.

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:13.140
In 2008,

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:14.890
how many mines did we have?

00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:16.720
Three.

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:20.920
Then later on, the managers

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.250
of the subsequent mines

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.420
must all be your apprentices, right?

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:25.890
Yes.

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:31.810
Come to think of it,

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.640
it's been 16 years

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.530
since you came back.

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:36.810
All these years,

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:38.270
you've contributed a lot.

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:39.870
You've done well.

00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:42.780
Still, I have to thank you, Chairman,

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:44.840
for the promotions and recognition.

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:48.560
Promotions and recognition

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:50.280
don't just fall from the sky.

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:53.070
What comes later

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:55.670
is built on what came before.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.230
You've never let me down,

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:03.460
right?

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:07.740
You're my boss.

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:10.219
I can't betray your trust.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.060
Good.

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:18.360
That's good.

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:21.070
Come on, drink your tea.

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:57.010
I've come and gone

00:35:58.110 --> 00:35:58.830
on this road

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:00.260
countless times.

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:03.800
I never thought Dad

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.060
was buried so close by.

00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:07.540
Maybe this was

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:08.700
the Captain's wish.

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:10.820
Like a gatekeeper,

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:12.270
watching over Mazhi.

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:16.710
Until we find the killer...

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.050
this isn't over.

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:23.990
Life and death are
like the snow on the mountains.

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:25.520
Some melt early, some late.

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:27.820
But in the end,

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:30.330
it all melts into streams and flows down.

00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:32.170
That is our karma.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.690
What do you mean by that?

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:36.340
The Captain died mysteriously.

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:37.340
Is this his karma?

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:38.500
Han,

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:39.830
don't twist

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:40.800
Zhacuo's words.

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:42.860
Finding the killer

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:44.280
is easier said than done.

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:47.350
But so many years have passed.

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:48.360
In this vast sea of people,

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.620
where do we even start?

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:51.750
Just finding the body

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:53.080
took more than a decade.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.050
In Bolamula...

00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:00.420
the Mountain Patrol never stopped

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:02.220
just because the road was rough.

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:06.040
On the contrary,

00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:08.610
we were best at

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:09.800
digging mud,

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:12.280
slamming the gas,

00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:15.430
and pushing the car together.

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:18.920
But sometimes,
even after digging for ages,

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:20.250
we still couldn't move.

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:23.350
Once, we were stuck for three days.

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:28.230
Yeah.

00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:31.630
That time, we used up all the alcohol

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:32.840
rubbing our legs.

00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:35.190
For the first time, Han cried

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:36.520
without having a drink.

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:41.450
I used to think

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.080
the Captain was very arbitrary.

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:46.690
Later, I realized

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:49.420
he was fully aware of

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:50.750
his own arbitrariness.

00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:53.750
But what he wanted more

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:57.720
was to eliminate difficulties one by one.

00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:04.440
We really had

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:06.340
so many troubles

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:07.450
back then.

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.150
But we can't

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:14.960
just leave a stuck truck

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:15.900
sitting there.

00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:20.850
Then go investigate.

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:22.920
Ju.

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:25.990
Please go investigate.

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:28.160
Find the truth for Dad.

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:55.760
When I said it's hard to investigate,

00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:56.400
I didn't mean

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.200
to stop her from investigating.

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:01.260
I support her fully.

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:04.610
I just feel for her,

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:06.320
you know?

00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:10.550
I'll pass.

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:15.260
So, you got dumped again?

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:17.700
What do you mean by "again"?

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:18.510
True.

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:20.410
There is no "again"

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:21.030
because you've

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:22.030
never gotten back together
in the first place.

00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:23.090
Get lost, get lost.

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.280
Sir, your water.

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:26.560
It's fine.

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:28.010
Brother-in-law.

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:29.570
As long as I

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:31.780
don't have a new brother-in-law,

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.050
you'll always

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:34.450
be my real brother-in-law.

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:35.120
No way.

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:36.530
Bai Ji, listen...

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:40.050
you've got to keep an eye on
your sister for me.

00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:40.900
If anything happens,

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:42.360
report to me immediately.

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:44.350
What could happen to her?

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:45.130
Not to mention she's now

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:46.130
on the task force.

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:47.440
Remember before?

00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:48.960
Mom forced her to go on blind dates.

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:49.630
How did that turn out?

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:51.070
Do I even need to say it?

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:52.590
Right?

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:53.440
Yeah, true.

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:55.510
Bai Ji,

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:57.150
answer me honestly.

00:39:57.170 --> 00:39:58.370
Do you think that all these years,

00:39:58.370 --> 00:39:59.140
I've been

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:00.360
a good husband?

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:05.690
Don't ask me.

00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:07.390
Ask yourself.

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:09.660
In any relationship,

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:11.070
as long as you have

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:12.400
a clear conscience,

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:13.360
that's enough.

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:14.420
What counts as a "good husband"?

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:16.110
It's all just for show.

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:19.610
Bro,

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:22.110
you are absolutely right.

00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:22.780
Yeah.

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:25.030
Bai Chun can't compare to you at all!

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:27.230
Not even close!

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:30.100
Your store

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:31.390
doesn't have a single customer,

00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:32.310
and you're glued to your phone.

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:33.440
What are you even busy with?

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:33.960
Stop it, stop it.

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:34.880
Come on, drink with me.

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:35.610
It's important business.

00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:36.090
Forget it.

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:37.230
I'm not drinking today.

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:38.210
You don't know.

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:39.530
The restaurant branch I opened

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:40.570
near the mining area

00:40:40.570 --> 00:40:41.570
is doing really well.

00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:42.630
It's packed every day.

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:43.990
We can barely keep up with
the ingredients,

00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:45.720
so I have to make them prep more.

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:46.780
Aren't those small mines

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:48.610
supposed to be suspended
for rectification?

00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:49.500
How could they just stop?

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:50.020
If they stopped just like that,

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:50.690
how would the workers

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:51.670
get by?

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:52.730
Work is still

00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:53.860
in full swing there.

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:06.440
Captain Bai, aren't you busy?

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:08.710
No, I'm not busy today.

00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:25.280
Captain Bai,

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:26.360
you've been

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:28.050
staring at me here for half an hour.

00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:30.450
You're making it impossible for me
to work.

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:32.730
It's been a whole day.

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:34.390
Are the results still not out?

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:36.650
The DNA testing technology

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.650
was just introduced to our bureau.

00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:40.580
The procedures are quite complex.

00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:42.100
Be patient.

00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:44.840
How long will it take?

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:47.940
At least another two or three days.

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:49.630
We've already expedited it

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:50.510
for you.

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:52.500
Besides, the clothes were washed,

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:54.030
and it's been so many years,

00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:56.500
so extracting DNA from them won't be easy.

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.100
I understand, I understand.

00:41:58.690 --> 00:41:59.150
Come in.

00:41:59.150 --> 00:41:59.950
Director Xia.

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:01.690
Some of the text's been recovered.

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:02.190
I've sent it over.

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:02.900
Please take a look.

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:03.570
I'll check it right away.

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:04.000
Okay.

00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:07.750
What text?

00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:11.760
I'll show you.

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:12.980
I'll just take a look.

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:14.960
It's a scrap of paper

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.760
we found in the victim's pants pocket.

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:17.820
It's been too long,

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.420
so it's heavily corroded.

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.000
The document examination unit

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.070
is restoring it.

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:23.550
Zhiyuan Freight.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:25.240
Zhiyuan...

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:26.960
Xia Jie,

00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:28.480
what kind of paper is this?

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.340
Is it a receipt?

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:31.900
The paper is torn into several pieces.

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:33.830
We can't piece together a complete one.

00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:34.360
There are two more pieces

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:35.530
soaking in solvent.

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:36.190
We have to finish processing them

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:37.250
before we can tell.

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:38.960
Okay.

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:43.730
If there's any update,

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:44.520
let me know.

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:45.460
Okay.

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:46.900
I'll be going then.

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:52.120
She's finally gone.

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:03.830
All you do is eat.

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:04.800
We have you on the task force

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:05.850
to investigate the case.

00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:06.810
I haven't eaten yet.

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:07.610
One last bite.

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:08.380
Hurry up!

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:09.040
Look through the files!
