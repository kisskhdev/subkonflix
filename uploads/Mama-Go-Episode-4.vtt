WEBVTT

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.520
From today on

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:55.679
You and I are not who we used to be

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:57.359
Legally speaking

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.679
You are my mom

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:00.439
But morally speaking

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.679
I am your brother

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.400
The parent who does all the housework

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:05.599
You

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.200
Are just a

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.120
Student who only thinks about exams

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.159
These here

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.359
Are the things you need to do next

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.680
I'll check on you randomly

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.519
Chinese, Math, English

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.319
Politics, History, Geography

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:20.920
No favoring any subject

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.519
I'm a science student

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.439
Good

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.799
You check this list

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.079
Sweeping, mopping, once a day

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.760
Laundry, cleaning the toilet

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.120
At least once every three days

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.120
Deep cleaning, once a week

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.719
Three meals a day must be nutritious

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.079
And no overspending

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.959
Also

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.079
The little brats on my balcony

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:50.519
Not a single one can die

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.840
I will check them every day

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.640
Before I get into college

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.800
We two will live on these savings

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.039
If you act like before again

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.240
Okay, okay, stop nagging

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.240
You're really acting the part

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.960
Take it. Put it away

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:16.159
You're really... like a TV drama

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.000
Watch less TV dramas

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:19.919
You should focus on your studies

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:21.360
I'm going to sleep. You sleep early too

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:55.439
Wait

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:58.479
Handing the family finances to Xiaocan

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.199
Is it really okay?

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.360
Xiaocan

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:12.319
Are you asleep?

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.280
Mom thought about it

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.479
About that card, Mom thinks it's better to

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.400
Trust my son

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:28.240
Such a big thing like treating the illness

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:29.879
He handled it pretty well

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.759
My son has grown up

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.759
He can be the pillar of the family

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.639
No

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.400
That little brat lied to me about Belgium

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.039
If I leave it alone

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:43.439
He'll cause even bigger trouble

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.520
Absolutely not

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.639
He lied to me

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:53.199
That was because he was afraid I wouldn't agree

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:58.319
But I can't let my son support me

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:00.400
If word gets out

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.439
What kind of mom would I be?

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.080
Xiaocan said

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.000
After improving my education

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.240
I can earn a lot more money a month

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:16.199
I can't just, now that I have a chance to restart

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:17.959
Settle for earning three thousand a month

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.480
Study

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.639
I still have to study

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.639
Although I managed to bluff my way through last time

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.439
right now, the family

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:40.120
doesn't have any savings left at all

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:43.000
Plus this month's living expenses

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.079
and the money needed for Mom's studies

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.720
If I continue to go to school

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.319
how am I supposed to support this family?

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.079
Mom

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.160
it's the first day of school today

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.839
Time to get up, up

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.079
I knew you wouldn't be able to get up

00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:07.879
That was close, that was close

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.439
And you call yourself a parent acting like this

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:10.560
Sit down and eat, quickly

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.519
Leave as soon as you're done

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.480
Tomorrow I... I'll set ten alarms

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:15.439
I'll definitely get up on time

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:16.839
I was careless today

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:18.360
It won't happen again, sorry

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:21.160
Hurry up, you're going to be late

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.519
Slow down

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.480
Can you make it? Hurry up

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:26.240
We'll make it

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.040
Lift those legs up

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.040
Run, run!

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:39.000
This time it's really not a dream

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:40.160
Enjoy it properly

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:41.160
Go to school properly

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.079
Don't you have classes?

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.000
Why are you still here?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.759
You should hurry and go

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:46.120
Don't get confused about who's the boss again

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.160
Which one of us is the parent right now?

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.360
Fine, fine, fine, you're the parent

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:51.160
Hurry up and go, hurry and go

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.839
Behave yourself, listen to the teacher

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.800
Study hard

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.800
Don't think about anything unrelated to studying

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.160
I know, hurry up and go, go

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.480
No puppy love

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.199
Students

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:11.199
What you see is our Joy of Learning School

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:13.199
This is a school with a long history

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:15.160
and a strong faculty

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:18.399
with many modern teaching facilities

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.399
In a little while

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:21.240
what we're going to show everyone is

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:22.920
our main teaching building

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.839
It can accommodate fifty classrooms

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:25.720
Wei Mingtian

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.040
There is also good news

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:28.800
which is that today we have invited

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.920
student Wei Mingtian

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.240
as a student representative

00:06:32.519 --> 00:06:33.319
to say hello to everyone

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.959
Student Wei Mingtian's expression

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:44.680
is still very expressive

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.480
Wow, so impressive

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:48.839
Hello, teacher

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.079
It's her

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:01.000
It's time for class now

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:02.439
We're still livestreaming here

00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:06.199
Won't they delay the class like this?

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:07.839
Then I'll go to class first

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:08.600
Goodbye, teacher

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.399
Goodbye, student

00:07:20.079 --> 00:07:22.000
We'll try our best to guarantee his attendance, okay?

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.480
That's right, that's right

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.160
You go about your business

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:23.720
Good luck

00:07:24.079 --> 00:07:24.639
See you later

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:26.720
Brother Maizi

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.600
When can I go to class?

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.920
It seems there's an exam in a bit

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.000
Why are you still here?

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:32.959
Hurry, hurry

00:07:32.959 --> 00:07:33.800
Hurry and go change your clothes

00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:34.920
Take the exam as soon as class is over

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.920
You have to work after the exam

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.360
Don't catch a cold, you kid

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:42.560
Hello, Old Zhang

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.120
Tell President Li

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:46.120
that we'll definitely attend the commercial performance

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:47.959
Don't worry, we can make time

00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:50.120
This kid just came from the countryside

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.519
You... you let him attend school for a few days

00:07:51.519 --> 00:07:52.240
It's no problem

00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:55.600
He's just a kid, once he's made a few thousand

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.240
he won't have the heart to study anymore

00:07:58.879 --> 00:07:59.319
Don't worry

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:03.800
Are you done changing?

00:08:56.919 --> 00:08:57.480
It's Wei Mingtian

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.320
He looks even more handsome up close

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.759
He's in the same class as us

00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:01.120
He looks even more handsome up close

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.799
He's in the same class as us?

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:06.759
It's her again

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.240
Her grades must be really good, right?

00:09:25.639 --> 00:09:26.200
Hello, students.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.480
Let me introduce myself to everyone.

00:09:28.879 --> 00:09:30.840
I am the head teacher for this training class.

00:09:31.039 --> 00:09:32.000
My name is Cheng Lexian.

00:09:32.679 --> 00:09:34.120
For the next year,

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.919
I will be spending it with all of you.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.759
Today is the first class.

00:09:37.919 --> 00:09:39.480
We won't start the lesson just yet.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.159
We'll do a placement test.

00:09:45.159 --> 00:09:45.679
Teacher,

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.840
can I take a leave of absence?

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.320
A leave of absence can only be processed in the first week of the semester.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.519
Besides,

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.960
you've been skipping class for so long already.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.279
Yes,

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.200
but my mom got sick really suddenly.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.039
I don't know how she got pancreatic cancer.

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:01.399
Could you please make an exception?

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:01.840
Sure.

00:10:02.919 --> 00:10:03.600
Why not?

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:04.919
It's understandable.

00:10:05.679 --> 00:10:06.360
I'll handle this for you.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:07.879
Thank you, Teacher.

00:10:08.279 --> 00:10:09.120
Then... go... go ahead.

00:10:09.519 --> 00:10:10.120
Okay.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:23.679
Kong Xiaocan.

00:10:31.919 --> 00:10:32.759
Is Auntie feeling any better?

00:10:36.759 --> 00:10:37.759
Have you calmed down?

00:10:41.559 --> 00:10:41.879
So,

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.559
what are you actually thinking?

00:10:48.279 --> 00:10:49.200
This necklace,

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.000
cost over two thousand back then, right?

00:10:52.679 --> 00:10:54.600
I remember this pair of shoes was fifteen hundred.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.519
That's enough to feed the family for a month.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:10:59.840
Kong Xiaocan.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:00.840
What are you thinking about?

00:11:03.039 --> 00:11:03.799
Xu... Xu Rui.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:06.960
Well,

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.000
is it possible that...

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:11.919
when the two of us...

00:11:14.159 --> 00:11:15.159
were dating...

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.879
the money I spent back then, could you slightly...

00:11:19.639 --> 00:11:20.039
a little...

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:26.679
It doesn't have to be money.

00:11:26.679 --> 00:11:28.519
Like, for instance, the necklace,

00:11:29.399 --> 00:11:30.840
I wonder if you still have the receipt.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:45.679
Bro

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.360
Are you crazy?

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.120
She could definitely toss me three meters.

00:11:53.679 --> 00:11:54.559
Oh my god, this...

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:57.639
About this...

00:11:58.279 --> 00:11:59.600
That was really uncool of you.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.679
Dating is about mutual affection.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.039
There's no rule that says once you break up,

00:12:03.039 --> 00:12:04.240
you ask for the money back.

00:12:04.559 --> 00:12:06.559
I know, I know.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:07.840
It's just that back then, my brain...

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.559
...just went blank.

00:12:10.759 --> 00:12:11.600
I'll be honest with you.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.759
Right now, our family has, at most,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.919
only a thousand yuan.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.600
Does... does Godmother know?

00:12:19.159 --> 00:12:20.159
I haven't told anyone.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:20.919
No one knows.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.240
I spent it all treating my mom.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.840
Now I still have to support my...

00:12:26.159 --> 00:12:26.639
cousin.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.360
If I had any other way, I...

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.360
A thousand, a thousand.

00:12:37.039 --> 00:12:37.519
Don't worry.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.000
I won't let you and cousin suffer.

00:12:43.399 --> 00:12:44.639
My red envelope money growing up...

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.039
...is all saved with my parents.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.320
They always said,

00:12:47.679 --> 00:12:48.919
they'd give it to me when I came of age.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.559
By my calculations,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:52.960
it should be close to a hundred grand.

00:12:54.559 --> 00:12:55.159
Just wait.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:56.919
Your buddy is about to get rich overnight.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:58.519
I'll take care of you.

00:12:59.279 --> 00:12:59.679
Bro.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.399
If you really have the money,

00:13:01.759 --> 00:13:02.639
consider it a loan from me.

00:13:02.639 --> 00:13:03.399
I'll definitely pay you back.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:10.600
Hello? Mom.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:11.759
I need to tell you something.

00:13:12.399 --> 00:13:13.799
I really need my red envelope money right now.

00:13:17.759 --> 00:13:18.159
It's gone?

00:13:26.679 --> 00:13:27.200
What?

00:13:27.639 --> 00:13:28.279
Where's my money?

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.039
Where's my 83,650?

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.240
What do you mean it went to Grandma's new house?

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.200
Wait.

00:13:35.519 --> 00:13:36.799
How could you use my money?

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.840
From a philosophical perspective,

00:13:39.279 --> 00:13:40.840
when an apple falls from a tree,

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.960
it no longer belongs to the tree,

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.639
but belongs to the earth.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:45.759
By the same logic,

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.399
when you give your money away,

00:13:47.519 --> 00:13:48.519
it is no longer your money,

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.519
but belongs to the person who received it.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:52.679
Mom...

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.639
Can't rely on my bro.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.559
Better just find a steady job.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.679
Base salary is four thousand a month.

00:14:07.919 --> 00:14:08.720
Food delivery.

00:14:14.759 --> 00:14:16.279
Running around like that is too tiring.

00:14:16.279 --> 00:14:17.960
Is there a job where I can just stand still?

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.960
Handing out flyers at a fixed spot.

00:14:26.679 --> 00:14:27.639
Maybe that could work.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.399
No way, I'd definitely get heat rash.

00:14:33.399 --> 00:14:33.840
No.

00:14:35.799 --> 00:14:37.600
I need to find a job in the shade.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.879
Sell beef pies like Aunt Zhang?

00:14:48.159 --> 00:14:49.639
With my zero cooking skills,

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:50.279
I'd better forget it.

00:14:51.279 --> 00:14:53.279
Plus, selling snacks requires a permit.

00:14:53.279 --> 00:14:55.480
And upfront costs. I don't have money.

00:15:02.559 --> 00:15:03.840
Hiring fitness coaches.

00:15:05.399 --> 00:15:06.960
Paid daily.

00:15:21.279 --> 00:15:21.879
Hello, handsome.

00:15:22.399 --> 00:15:22.960
Hello, hello.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:23.279
Hello.

00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:24.600
Is this your first time at our gym?

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:25.279
Yes.

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:26.320
Our gym here...

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.360
...has a constant temperature and humidity fresh air system.

00:15:28.679 --> 00:15:29.639
And our coaches...

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:30.320
...are extremely professional.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:30.919
Okay, I wanted to...

00:15:30.919 --> 00:15:32.519
Look, they all specialize in specific areas.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.360
She teaches Pilates.

00:15:34.799 --> 00:15:36.240
She teaches Yoga.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.200
She teaches Kettlebells.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.039
They're all you.

00:15:39.639 --> 00:15:41.039
Sometimes I do get a bit overwhelmed.

00:15:41.039 --> 00:15:43.759
No, I'd like to speak to your manager.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:44.720
That would be yours truly.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.559
That's also you.

00:15:45.559 --> 00:15:47.200
So you've come to the right person today.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.159
I can even give you an extra discount.

00:15:49.679 --> 00:15:50.360
Take a look around.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:50.960
I wanted to...

00:15:51.279 --> 00:15:52.879
Handsome, here, have some water.

00:15:53.159 --> 00:15:54.240
No, no need, really.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.360
Have some water. Don't be polite. Why be polite?

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.879
I... I wanted to ask about the salary here.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.000
It's just...

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:01.480
You're here to apply for a job?

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:02.919
Yes.

00:16:03.159 --> 00:16:03.480
Yes.

00:16:03.799 --> 00:16:04.960
Mainly because you're too busy here.

00:16:13.039 --> 00:16:14.480
The test results have been graded.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.360
The grades are a complete mess.

00:16:22.759 --> 00:16:25.000
You are the worst batch I've ever taught.

00:16:27.399 --> 00:16:28.159
That saying...

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.279
...from my homeroom teacher when I was little...

00:16:30.519 --> 00:16:32.480
...to every one of Kong Xiaocan's teachers...

00:16:32.799 --> 00:16:33.960
...they say it every year.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.000
All students...

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.039
...pack up your things.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.639
Stand at the very back.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.519
We're going to arrange the seating today.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.559
Such a handsome guy.

00:16:48.679 --> 00:16:49.960
I really want to sit next to him.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:50.600
Me too.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.399
The students whose names I call next...

00:16:53.559 --> 00:16:54.919
...come to the front to get your test paper.

00:16:55.279 --> 00:16:55.960
Dong Xuefan.

00:16:58.559 --> 00:16:59.240
You did well.

00:17:00.039 --> 00:17:00.759
You got first place.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.360
Here, you sit right here.

00:17:03.519 --> 00:17:04.440
Li Yinling.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.759
Here, take your paper. Sit over there.

00:17:08.519 --> 00:17:09.000
Gao Nan.

00:17:15.759 --> 00:17:16.839
Kong Guifang, Wei Mingtian.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:24.920
You two sit right here

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:26.880
Right under my nose

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.000
Sitting in the front is good

00:17:29.359 --> 00:17:30.440
You can hear clearly from the front

00:17:30.839 --> 00:17:32.640
You usually have to score high to sit here

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.359
Isn't this a dream come true?

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.279
You two can still smile?

00:17:39.599 --> 00:17:41.119
One is dead last, the other is second to last

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.200
Class, regarding our seating arrangements

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.200
They aren't fixed

00:17:45.359 --> 00:17:46.359
We'll rotate every week

00:17:46.519 --> 00:17:48.240
But you two stay put

00:17:48.759 --> 00:17:50.200
You sit right here under my nose

00:17:52.359 --> 00:17:52.920
Teacher

00:17:53.759 --> 00:17:55.079
Who's dead last, me or her?

00:17:55.279 --> 00:17:56.839
Now you're getting competitive?

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.279
You two are neck and neck

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.680
Alright, let me explain the questions

00:18:02.279 --> 00:18:03.440
Look at the first page of the exam

00:18:03.599 --> 00:18:04.839
First big question, part one

00:18:07.319 --> 00:18:09.000
Do you want to work here?

00:18:09.599 --> 00:18:10.039
Can I?

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.640
Of course I do. Yes

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:12.799
Do you know how to chat?

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.240
Let me teach you

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.039
Why do people walk into a gym?

00:18:24.079 --> 00:18:25.160
Because of fear

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.880
They ate too much, they fear getting fat

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.200
Everyone pursues beauty

00:18:30.599 --> 00:18:31.920
So they walk into the gym

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.359
Wanting to become a better version of themselves

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:34.960
So, what about our fitness coaches?

00:18:35.119 --> 00:18:37.160
We must provide enough emotional value

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.079
Make them believe

00:18:38.119 --> 00:18:40.400
That they can become that better self

00:18:40.759 --> 00:18:41.200
Right

00:18:41.799 --> 00:18:43.799
So what kind of art is fitness?

00:18:44.359 --> 00:18:45.000
Is it...

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:45.440
Physical?

00:18:46.559 --> 00:18:48.480
It's an art of language

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.400
As the saying goes

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.440
As long as the coach praises well

00:18:53.119 --> 00:18:54.640
You won't be short of students

00:18:55.599 --> 00:18:56.319
For example

00:18:58.039 --> 00:18:59.519
"Your muscle engagement is getting better!"

00:19:00.279 --> 00:19:01.599
"Keep your shoulders down, shoulders down"

00:19:02.359 --> 00:19:04.279
"Look, isn't that jawline popping out?"

00:19:04.599 --> 00:19:05.519
"And that swan neck!"

00:19:05.799 --> 00:19:06.599
Really? Sis, don't say that...

00:19:06.799 --> 00:19:07.680
"You're like a whole new person these past few days"

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.920
Isn't that lying with your eyes wide open?

00:19:10.079 --> 00:19:10.680
Also

00:19:11.519 --> 00:19:14.119
Fitness requires perseverance

00:19:14.759 --> 00:19:16.319
You must remember to tell the students

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.640
Don't buy per-visit passes. Monthly passes are useless

00:19:18.799 --> 00:19:19.839
And a waste of money

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.200
Encourage them to get a quarterly pass

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.799
A six-month pass, an annual pass

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:24.880
You have to tell the student

00:19:25.119 --> 00:19:27.319
"You're just one step away from being a goddess"

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.480
"In six months, you'll be Pamela"

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.559
"In a year, you'll be a Kardashian"

00:19:33.759 --> 00:19:34.359
Just like that

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.079
"If you keep training like this..."

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.319
"In six months, you'll be Pamela"

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.559
"In a year, you'll be the Chinese Kardashian"

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:41.480
Really?

00:19:42.359 --> 00:19:43.319
Then I'll renew for another year

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.079
Good

00:19:45.319 --> 00:19:46.880
The last point is very important

00:19:47.279 --> 00:19:49.759
You can't let students reach their goals too fast

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:50.839
If they all end up like me

00:19:50.839 --> 00:19:51.559
And become coaches

00:19:51.559 --> 00:19:52.240
Who will buy lessons?

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.440
You have to make the journey from start to finish

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.039
A constant cycle of hesitation

00:19:57.039 --> 00:19:58.880
Drag out the process

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.079
You have to tell them

00:20:00.759 --> 00:20:01.920
"Just one more rep"

00:20:02.119 --> 00:20:02.920
"Don't get too tired"

00:20:04.599 --> 00:20:05.759
"Just one more rep"

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.319
"Don't get too tired"

00:20:10.599 --> 00:20:12.400
"We need to balance work and rest"

00:20:12.839 --> 00:20:14.160
"Look how great your form is today"

00:20:15.119 --> 00:20:15.640
Renew the card

00:20:16.839 --> 00:20:17.359
Okay

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:19.759
Do you get it?

00:20:22.559 --> 00:20:23.240
Got it, Sis

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:23.880
But

00:20:24.519 --> 00:20:26.240
My physique really isn't much...

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:27.119
Doesn't matter

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.200
I'll have him teach you later

00:20:29.359 --> 00:20:30.559
Two days of training and you'll get it

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:31.119
But

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.079
Sorry, I probably...

00:20:33.519 --> 00:20:35.160
Sis, isn't this just a scam?

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:37.799
Your pay for today

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.359
Can I start?

00:20:44.039 --> 00:20:45.400
Sis, tell me those points again

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.079
I'll take some notes

00:21:03.839 --> 00:21:04.519
It's not broken.

00:21:05.119 --> 00:21:06.240
Help yourself.

00:21:17.799 --> 00:21:18.519
Need help?

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:22.960
You have to remember at all times,

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.079
you have a celebrity persona now.

00:21:25.079 --> 00:21:26.200
Maintain the persona.

00:21:29.559 --> 00:21:30.480
I'm not carrying it upstairs.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:31.960
I'm taking it downstairs to throw away.

00:21:33.039 --> 00:21:33.880
Isn't that even easier?

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:34.519
I'll help you.

00:21:35.519 --> 00:21:36.039
You're welcome.

00:21:47.079 --> 00:21:47.440
Mom.

00:21:48.279 --> 00:21:48.960
Wash your hands. Time to eat.

00:21:54.799 --> 00:21:56.079
Eat? What's with the act?

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.160
Oh my god.

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.799
Are you going to school or the gym?

00:22:07.799 --> 00:22:08.400
Training your back?

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.599
Packing so much stuff.

00:22:09.599 --> 00:22:10.240
Let me, let me, let me.

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:10.720
Wait a second.

00:22:11.279 --> 00:22:12.680
Aren't these all my error notebooks?

00:22:13.559 --> 00:22:15.440
These... these are from when you were in school...

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.720
My twelve years of accumulation.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.400
Schools provide them now. Why take these...

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:23.400
Wait.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:25.480
My dear mother.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:26.480
Do you feel that...

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:27.640
studying...

00:22:28.119 --> 00:22:29.119
is a bit stressful?

00:22:29.519 --> 00:22:30.519
Found out studying isn't that simple?

00:22:30.519 --> 00:22:31.640
That you can't keep up?

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:32.720
Not at all.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:33.880
It's pretty simple.

00:22:34.599 --> 00:22:35.039
Is it?

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.160
You had an exam, right?

00:22:36.319 --> 00:22:36.880
How was it?

00:22:38.279 --> 00:22:38.799
Pretty good.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:39.359
Really?

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:40.400
Then let me see the paper.

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:40.920
What's the score?

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:41.880
Pretty good? I'll sign it for you.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.000
If you did well, I have to sign it.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:43.400
I'm the parent.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.200
Let's eat, let's eat. I'm hungry.

00:22:44.279 --> 00:22:45.319
You know studying is hard now.

00:22:45.359 --> 00:22:46.079
Ordering takeout again.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:47.519
I'm telling you.

00:22:47.519 --> 00:22:48.799
Starting tomorrow, we have to cook.

00:22:48.799 --> 00:22:49.759
No more takeout.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.960
It's all junk food.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.359
It's expensive and we can't finish it.

00:22:52.359 --> 00:22:53.000
Such a waste.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:54.920
Today is different.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:56.759
Today is special. Let's celebrate.

00:22:56.759 --> 00:22:57.720
I found a part-time job.

00:22:58.319 --> 00:22:58.880
Part-time job?

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:00.440
What kind of job?

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.640
How much does it pay? What do you do?

00:23:02.519 --> 00:23:03.400
Don't worry about it.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.559
Anyway...

00:23:06.799 --> 00:23:07.519
take this and splurge.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:09.839
You just study hard.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:10.960
Make progress every day.

00:23:11.079 --> 00:23:11.880
Don't worry about anything else.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.440
A job is a job.

00:23:13.599 --> 00:23:14.480
Studying is the priority.

00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:15.839
Studying comes first.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.319
For you right now, studying is the most important thing.

00:23:17.319 --> 00:23:19.039
I'm the parent. You're the cousin now.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:20.720
Who are you calling cousin?

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.119
You... you...

00:23:22.119 --> 00:23:23.680
Mom, you're getting more and more childish.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.200
Take these old bad habits of yours...

00:23:25.279 --> 00:23:26.279
rein them in and change them.

00:23:26.279 --> 00:23:28.359
Think about what your identity is now, right?

00:23:28.359 --> 00:23:29.640
You have no respect for elders.

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:32.759
I'm going to check your paper.

00:24:01.519 --> 00:24:02.799
Let's look at the first question on the test paper

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.599
You chose A for this one too

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:05.680
I also chose A

00:24:06.359 --> 00:24:07.279
The answer must be A

00:24:07.759 --> 00:24:08.799
I calculated it three times

00:24:09.119 --> 00:24:09.759
It's definitely A

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:10.960
The answer to question one is B

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.319
I shouldn't have to explain such a simple point

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:15.799
Do a few more

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:16.680
Watch your breathing

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.359
Coach, come here

00:24:19.559 --> 00:24:19.960
Coming

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.440
Exhale

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.480
Engage your glutes

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:25.920
Question two is A

00:24:26.839 --> 00:24:27.799
I chose C for this one

00:24:28.599 --> 00:24:29.079
It's okay

00:24:29.839 --> 00:24:30.960
One of us has to be right

00:24:31.799 --> 00:24:32.839
Question two is actually B

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.920
Anyone with a brain should know this

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.359
I won't explain this one, moving on

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.039
Do you know how to use the washing machine

00:24:42.359 --> 00:24:43.119
Don't break it

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:44.519
I don't know how

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:48.240
Breathe

00:24:49.599 --> 00:24:50.599
Lower your center of gravity

00:24:51.079 --> 00:24:51.599
One more

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:52.599
One more

00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:59.599
Help me

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:24.319
Keep breathing

00:25:24.319 --> 00:25:24.880
Use your core

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:25.480
Control your arms

00:25:25.519 --> 00:25:25.920
Okay

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.759
I can't hold on much longer

00:25:27.759 --> 00:25:28.839
You must persist, it's the last set

00:25:28.839 --> 00:25:29.400
Here, let me help you

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.480
No, I can't do it, help me, help me

00:25:30.839 --> 00:25:31.599
Lift it up, no

00:25:31.599 --> 00:25:32.799
Lift... I can't lift it

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:33.759
Don't, don't, don't

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:56.640
Mom

00:25:57.559 --> 00:25:58.000
Mom

00:25:59.599 --> 00:26:00.960
There's something wrong with this egg

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:02.480
Mom

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:09.039
Mom

00:26:09.559 --> 00:26:09.880
Mom

00:26:10.599 --> 00:26:11.440
There's a problem with the pot

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:12.519
What is this

00:26:12.839 --> 00:26:13.519
I don't know

00:26:13.519 --> 00:26:15.440
Is it the pot or the egg that's the problem

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.680
You've burnt it all

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.200
Don't eat it then, you might get poisoned

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.759
I'll make you some instant noodles

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:20.839
Or order takeout

00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:21.680
I'm running late

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:22.799
I'm not eating, I'm not eating

00:26:24.079 --> 00:26:25.359
I haven't even shown my skills yet

00:26:26.039 --> 00:26:26.799
It's too late

00:26:27.279 --> 00:26:28.680
Remember to clean up the kitchen

00:26:28.759 --> 00:26:30.400
I think it's definitely the egg's fault

00:26:30.599 --> 00:26:31.200
Going, going, going

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.160
Remember to eat something yourself

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:32.759
Clothes, clothes

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.759
You're pretty happy not doing housework

00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:38.279
Yeah, pretty happy

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:38.759
Right

00:26:38.759 --> 00:26:39.480
Going, going, going

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:40.200
Wait a second

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.759
Trash, trash

00:26:42.759 --> 00:26:44.519
You don't notice chores at all now

00:26:46.119 --> 00:26:47.480
Wait, why throw this away

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:48.680
I can still wear this

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.400
I can wear it again

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.480
What did the ground rules say

00:26:50.599 --> 00:26:51.200
How old are you now

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:51.880
What kind of clothes are you wearing

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:52.839
I'm nipping this in the bud

00:26:52.839 --> 00:26:53.640
You're not allowed to wear it again, go, go

00:26:54.279 --> 00:26:55.759
You're a really grumpy parent

00:26:55.759 --> 00:26:57.200
Remember to eat something on the way

00:26:57.519 --> 00:26:58.680
Watch your health, be good

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.880
How could it burn

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:29.720
Sister Xiong

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.599
Didn't we say the wages were...

00:27:32.599 --> 00:27:33.039
What about it?

00:27:34.599 --> 00:27:35.359
Paid daily?

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.000
Kong Xiaocan

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.839
What did I hire you to do?

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.559
I'm training seriously.

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.319
You're serious? Do I need you to train?

00:27:43.319 --> 00:27:44.160
Didn't I say at the beginning...

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.799
I said, what do we give the clients?

00:27:45.799 --> 00:27:47.680
An uplift in emotional value.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.759
It's all about companionship.

00:27:48.759 --> 00:27:49.799
I accompanied... I did.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.640
I've been watching you these past two days.

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:52.519
A male client...

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.400
He was training over there.

00:27:54.519 --> 00:27:55.519
And you choked him.

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:56.920
And another male client...

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.039
He was running fine on the treadmill.

00:27:58.119 --> 00:27:58.880
You flung him off.

00:27:59.079 --> 00:27:59.799
That was the same person.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.319
Oh my god, that guy...

00:28:01.319 --> 00:28:02.240
That guy is so miserable.

00:28:03.119 --> 00:28:04.759
Finally, we got a female client.

00:28:04.839 --> 00:28:05.319
Pretty good.

00:28:05.519 --> 00:28:07.480
She got a bit tired from training here.

00:28:07.799 --> 00:28:08.720
Looking for a shoulder.

00:28:09.119 --> 00:28:10.680
It was your time to shine.

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.920
You should've offered your shoulder.

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.000
You should've moved it up there.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:13.799
Why did you dodge?

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.559
You threw her right into the mirror.

00:28:15.559 --> 00:28:16.480
You smashed my mirror to pieces.

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.880
Enough, stop wandering around in this room.

00:28:19.319 --> 00:28:20.799
You've scared away all my clients.

00:28:20.839 --> 00:28:22.720
Hurry up. How about this, go downstairs and hand out flyers.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.440
Get some new clients. Go.

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:27.200
What are you doing?

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:28.759
What are you doing?

00:28:28.759 --> 00:28:30.359
This isn't your lane.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:31.400
This...

00:28:31.799 --> 00:28:32.680
...is your lane.

00:28:32.799 --> 00:28:33.279
Pay attention.

00:28:33.519 --> 00:28:34.920
Your eyes need to be seductive.

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:35.759
Seductive.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.119
Keep that smile on.

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.759
Put away those pitiful biceps.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:39.519
There's nothing there.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.559
Handsome, want a fish?

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:45.720
Is this sea bass?

00:28:46.079 --> 00:28:46.480
Yes.

00:28:46.759 --> 00:28:47.359
How much is it?

00:28:47.599 --> 00:28:48.400
Twenty-five a jin.

00:28:49.839 --> 00:28:50.599
That's too expensive, forget it.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:51.880
You're a student.

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.160
Eating fish is good for the brain.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.240
Look how fresh this fish is.

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:56.920
Then... then I'll take one.

00:28:57.519 --> 00:28:58.119
How about a big one?

00:28:58.119 --> 00:28:59.359
No, no, a small one. It's for one person.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.240
A big guy like you can't finish one fish?

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.400
Big... big guys don't deserve to eat it.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.880
It's for a little girl, a small one is fine.

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:06.200
Alright, alright.

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.839
I'll clean it up nicely for you.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.519
Xiaocan, you eat first.

00:29:11.119 --> 00:29:12.720
Finish the fish yourself.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.359
Studying uses the brain, you need the nutrition.

00:29:16.319 --> 00:29:17.880
Mom had rice noodles with Aunt Niu this afternoon.

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.039
Mom isn't hungry.

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.000
Why has it been so many days...

00:29:27.079 --> 00:29:28.480
...and there's no progress at all?

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.200
This can still be used.

00:30:11.839 --> 00:30:13.000
Is this guy a pervert?

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:14.160
A stalker.

00:30:48.319 --> 00:30:48.839
Isn't that...

00:30:49.039 --> 00:30:50.440
Screw you!

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:52.400
Xiaocan, what's wrong with him?

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.680
Stalking you! He's a pervert!

00:30:53.799 --> 00:30:54.559
Stalking me?

00:30:54.759 --> 00:30:55.200
Beat him!

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:56.480
Have you no shame?

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:56.960
Misunderstanding!

00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:57.759
Call the police!

00:30:58.039 --> 00:30:58.559
You call the police!

00:30:58.559 --> 00:30:59.400
Misunderstanding! Misunderstanding!

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:00.200
Who are you? Stop hitting me!

00:31:00.279 --> 00:31:01.440
It's a misunderstanding! Misunderstanding!

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:01.960
Call the police!

00:31:02.039 --> 00:31:02.960
Gui Fang, stop hitting! Who is this?

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:03.680
Who is it?

00:31:06.279 --> 00:31:07.000
It's me, Gui Fang.

00:31:08.279 --> 00:31:08.920
Wei Mingtian.

00:31:10.079 --> 00:31:10.559
Who?

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.319
My cram school classmate.

00:31:13.799 --> 00:31:14.839
I went to the cram school...

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:15.680
Xiaocan, Xiaocan.

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.440
He really is my cram school classmate.

00:31:20.039 --> 00:31:21.000
Then why did he follow you home?

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.359
Isn't that still stalking?

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:25.000
Yeah!

00:31:25.279 --> 00:31:26.319
Why did you follow me home?

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:27.079
I...

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.079
I live right here.

00:31:31.519 --> 00:31:32.400
Bullshit.

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.519
Is there really such a coincidence?

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:38.680
It... it really is a coincidence.

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.799
Look, this really is my home.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:41.559
It... it really is.

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.559
Come in, come in. Don't stand at the door.

00:31:42.559 --> 00:31:43.039
What a coincidence.

00:31:43.599 --> 00:31:44.240
Should we take off...

00:31:44.839 --> 00:31:45.480
Probably not necessary.

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:48.720
Your place is quite...

00:31:49.519 --> 00:31:49.920
Quite...

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:50.960
Simple.

00:31:51.039 --> 00:31:51.599
Quite desolate.

00:31:51.599 --> 00:31:52.200
I think...

00:31:52.799 --> 00:31:53.799
This is already very nice.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.079
Yeah, quite austere.

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.640
I'm really sorry about earlier.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:58.880
Right, right. I was also... I was also a bit...

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.079
I didn't know who it was.

00:32:00.079 --> 00:32:01.200
I was too heavy-handed.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.160
Really sorry. It's okay, it's okay.

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:02.799
It doesn't matter.

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:03.599
You're really okay?

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.160
Didn't we meet in the neighborhood last time?

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.319
You... you wanted to bring it back?

00:32:08.319 --> 00:32:09.599
And I helped you take it down.

00:32:09.599 --> 00:32:10.640
How did you... just pick it back up?

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.519
Right, right. That's the one.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.960
Actually, I wanted to retrieve it that day.

00:32:14.359 --> 00:32:15.359
Then I actually made things worse.

00:32:15.359 --> 00:32:16.599
I even gave it a kick back then.

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:17.440
I'm sorry.

00:32:21.119 --> 00:32:21.799
Is this you?

00:32:22.319 --> 00:32:23.079
This... me...

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.000
Isn't this our home?

00:32:24.119 --> 00:32:24.720
This... I...

00:32:24.839 --> 00:32:26.319
Is this classmate of yours seriously a bit...

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.279
Is this yours?

00:32:27.599 --> 00:32:28.319
What do you mean?

00:32:28.759 --> 00:32:29.680
No, this...

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.240
I think it's still pretty good.

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.160
Wash it and it's still usable.

00:32:32.359 --> 00:32:33.440
You think you can wear it or something?

00:32:34.039 --> 00:32:35.480
Alter it a bit and it can be an apron.

00:32:36.279 --> 00:32:37.079
Or a curtain.

00:32:37.279 --> 00:32:38.920
Look, my place is missing one just like this.

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:40.359
No...

00:32:42.039 --> 00:32:42.480
Oh my god.

00:32:42.799 --> 00:32:43.640
You... give this to me.

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:44.200
Don't waste it.

00:32:44.319 --> 00:32:45.799
I'll give you a new one later.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.920
You're so thrifty and domestic.

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:48.759
That's amazing, really amazing.

00:32:48.839 --> 00:32:50.880
By the way, come over to our place for a meal later.

00:32:51.279 --> 00:32:52.599
Look, your place doesn't really look like

00:32:52.599 --> 00:32:53.559
it's set up for cooking.

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.200
Eating... forget it, forget it.

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.079
We'll pass on the meal.

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.480
Brother Maizi will get angry if he finds out.

00:33:00.279 --> 00:33:01.200
Doesn't he look familiar to you?

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.200
I said he looked familiar. You...

00:33:03.319 --> 00:33:04.440
Are you...

00:33:06.519 --> 00:33:07.960
- I've been on TV. - The one from Peace No.3 Primary School?

00:33:08.599 --> 00:33:09.200
No, sorry.

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:10.960
I thought... my elementary school classmate.

00:33:11.759 --> 00:33:12.519
You... you've been on TV?

00:33:13.279 --> 00:33:13.680
Yeah.

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:15.440
A star!

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.319
I wouldn't call myself a star.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.039
I just appeared on TV, that's all.

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:22.119
As you can see...

00:33:22.119 --> 00:33:23.720
Our farmer friends are very enthusiastic.

00:33:23.839 --> 00:33:26.200
My home is in a very remote mountain valley.

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.559
There was only one school there.

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.759
I studied there until junior high.

00:33:31.279 --> 00:33:32.359
And didn't go to school after that.

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:33.759
Where do they buy potatoes?

00:33:34.359 --> 00:33:34.759
Brother.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:35.880
Do you know where they buy potatoes?

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:36.559
I'm not sure either.

00:33:36.559 --> 00:33:37.559
Ask someone else.

00:33:38.359 --> 00:33:39.440
Is the potato collection here?

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:40.640
Where do they buy potatoes?

00:33:40.799 --> 00:33:41.160
Brother.

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.240
Where do they buy potatoes?

00:33:42.319 --> 00:33:42.920
And now...

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.400
With the development of technology...

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.039
My dad sent me to sell the harvest.

00:33:46.519 --> 00:33:48.559
I ran into a bunch of people livestreaming there.

00:33:49.039 --> 00:33:49.680
And I ended up on TV.

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:50.599
Do you know where they buy potatoes?

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:51.680
Young man, you're quite handsome.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.920
Let me interview you. Come here, come.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.359
Are you also a farmer participating in our

00:33:55.359 --> 00:33:56.599
public welfare support program this time?

00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.039
Look at our camera and speak.

00:33:59.519 --> 00:34:01.079
Can you share with our audience

00:34:01.079 --> 00:34:02.640
what agricultural products you brought?

00:34:03.039 --> 00:34:05.000
I brought my family's potatoes.

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:07.720
So what's special about your family's potatoes?

00:34:09.119 --> 00:34:10.840
My family's potatoes have red skin.

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:13.280
You've never eaten such delicious potatoes.

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:14.679
The smaller they are, the tastier.

00:34:15.079 --> 00:34:15.760
Milky flavor.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.360
Dogs eat them and won't even eat poop.

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:19.960
Young man, you're very humorous, very humorous.

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:21.000
You make me want to eat them.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:22.320
I'll get you two to taste.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:22.840
No need, no need.

00:34:27.559 --> 00:34:28.360
Potatoes, potatoes

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:29.480
Our family's potatoes

00:34:29.559 --> 00:34:30.519
Are su-su-super tender

00:34:30.519 --> 00:34:32.199
Dogs eat 'em and won't even eat shit

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:33.960
Young man, you're very humorous

00:34:34.039 --> 00:34:34.480
Yes

00:34:34.599 --> 00:34:35.079
Yes

00:34:35.079 --> 00:34:36.079
May I ask what you brought

00:34:36.079 --> 00:34:36.880
To share with everyone

00:34:37.559 --> 00:34:38.760
I am a little puppy

00:34:39.039 --> 00:34:39.880
Little puppy

00:34:40.039 --> 00:34:40.880
Little puppy

00:34:41.039 --> 00:34:42.079
Where do they buy potatoes?

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.320
Where do they buy potatoes?

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:44.440
I am a little puppy

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:45.639
A special little puppy

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:46.760
A rustic little puppy

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:48.440
Dogs eat 'em and won't even eat shit

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:49.719
Won't even eat shit

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.000
Little puppy

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:51.840
Won't even eat shit

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:53.719
I am a little puppy

00:34:54.599 --> 00:34:55.880
Young man, you're very humorous

00:34:56.039 --> 00:34:56.760
Won't even eat shit

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:57.519
Even I want to eat them

00:34:57.519 --> 00:34:58.440
I'll get you two to try

00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:58.920
No need, no need

00:34:59.039 --> 00:35:00.440
And then it seems like

00:35:01.119 --> 00:35:02.159
I got famous

00:35:05.119 --> 00:35:06.119
You don't need to be nervous.

00:35:06.199 --> 00:35:07.320
Brother Maizi isn't here either.

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.880
Just make yourself at home here.

00:35:10.679 --> 00:35:12.760
A big star like you...

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.559
You surely make a lot of money.

00:35:14.559 --> 00:35:15.800
Why do you live in our old neighborhood?

00:35:16.119 --> 00:35:16.639
No, no.

00:35:17.079 --> 00:35:17.880
I'm not a star.

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:20.960
Well, I guess I sort of am.

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.199
Anyway, it's just Brother Maizi...

00:35:23.639 --> 00:35:25.239
I do whatever he tells me to do.

00:35:26.039 --> 00:35:26.840
You're too modest.

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:29.039
I'm so happy to be neighbors with a star.

00:35:29.039 --> 00:35:30.519
I never would have imagined it. And...

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.840
You're not like those stars on TV. So...

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:34.559
Those ones are so pretentious.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.639
I hear they all act like divas.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.400
Can't act well and can't sing either.

00:35:39.239 --> 00:35:41.320
But you... you look really nice.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:42.320
Not like the others.

00:35:43.119 --> 00:35:44.480
Do... do you want to go to college too?

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:45.360
Yes.

00:35:45.719 --> 00:35:46.840
My biggest dream is...

00:35:47.039 --> 00:35:47.719
To get into college.

00:35:48.119 --> 00:35:48.679
Me too.

00:35:49.559 --> 00:35:50.159
Comrade-in-arms.

00:35:51.079 --> 00:35:51.599
Good comrade-in-arms.

00:35:52.079 --> 00:35:53.280
You guys chat. I'll go cook.

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:55.800
No matter what you do, you have to study hard.

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.599
But studying is just too hard.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:35:59.199
Gui Fang.

00:35:59.599 --> 00:36:00.760
Did you understand the questions you got wrong today?

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:01.519
I understood.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:02.639
Wait until I finish cooking.

00:36:02.639 --> 00:36:03.400
I'll explain them to you in a bit.

00:36:03.519 --> 00:36:04.119
Thanks, Gui Fang.

00:36:05.239 --> 00:36:05.639
Do you...

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.119
Have a girlfriend?

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.079
You probably can't say.

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.119
Kong Xiaocan, look.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:12.559
Do you even know how to shop?

00:36:13.719 --> 00:36:14.599
You bought such a small one.

00:36:14.719 --> 00:36:15.280
How are we supposed to eat this?

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.320
I didn't know that.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:18.800
I originally bought it for just one person.

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.480
For one person?

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.239
I'm not eating?

00:36:21.559 --> 00:36:22.719
Sometimes when you talk, you really... you don't...

00:36:23.519 --> 00:36:24.760
Don't be disrespectful to me.

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:26.000
Who are you calling disrespectful?

00:36:26.079 --> 00:36:26.760
God, you tell us.

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.079
Who looks older, me or my cousin?

00:36:31.199 --> 00:36:31.559
Young...

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.320
Brother Xiaocan does... seem a bit old-looking.

00:36:36.039 --> 00:36:37.239
Hurry up and go cook, Cousin.

00:36:37.639 --> 00:36:38.719
I need to chat with the star.

00:36:38.719 --> 00:36:39.599
Their professional skills...

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:40.840
I really don't like them.

00:36:41.119 --> 00:36:41.599
You must really...

00:36:41.599 --> 00:36:42.079
Xiaocan.

00:36:42.079 --> 00:36:42.920
Kong Xiaocan, open the door!

00:36:43.079 --> 00:36:43.599
Open the door!

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:46.360
Why are you here?

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:47.599
To deliver hairy crabs.

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:48.559
Is your cousin home?

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:49.159
Cousin!

00:36:49.599 --> 00:36:50.000
Cousin!

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:50.880
She's not here, not here, not here.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:51.480
Cousin! Go, go, go.

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:52.480
Leave the hairy crabs, you get out.

00:36:52.599 --> 00:36:53.840
That's no way to treat a guest.

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:54.840
Cousin!

00:36:55.519 --> 00:36:56.559
Do you like hairy crabs?

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:58.280
Stop calling me Cousin.

00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.440
It's really awkward.

00:37:01.559 --> 00:37:02.199
How about...

00:37:03.039 --> 00:37:03.960
I'll call you Fangfang.

00:37:07.639 --> 00:37:08.760
Then just call her cousin.

00:37:09.599 --> 00:37:10.239
Whatever you say.

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:11.800
Here, Cousin, let me help you.

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:12.440
No need, no need, no need.

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:13.920
You just go sit outside.

00:37:14.119 --> 00:37:14.719
I'll do it myself.

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.519
Living together with Xiaocan...

00:37:17.639 --> 00:37:18.559
must be really hard on you.

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:19.239
He...

00:37:19.239 --> 00:37:20.920
was spoiled rotten by my Godmother.

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.000
He can't do anything.

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.159
Things like cooking,

00:37:23.159 --> 00:37:24.239
Cousin has to do it herself.

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:24.840
Let me help you.

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:25.400
No need, really.

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:26.320
You... you go outside.

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.000
I don't need your help.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:27.639
How can I do that?

00:37:27.639 --> 00:37:28.719
Go, get out right now.

00:37:28.719 --> 00:37:29.440
I'll just wash this for you.

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:30.119
This really doesn't need washing.

00:37:30.119 --> 00:37:31.000
I'll do it, I'll do it.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:31.920
Out, out, out, get out.

00:37:32.639 --> 00:37:33.519
I'm helping out here.

00:37:33.519 --> 00:37:34.679
You're lucky we're letting you eat here.

00:37:34.679 --> 00:37:35.920
Can you stop being a nuisance here?

00:37:36.159 --> 00:37:36.559
This...

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.079
Let me introduce you.

00:37:38.559 --> 00:37:39.199
This is...

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.039
Does he look familiar?

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:46.360
That...

00:37:47.039 --> 00:37:47.880
The one from Peace No.3 Primary School.

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:48.480
No.

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:49.840
He is actually...

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:51.960
Think about it yourself.

00:37:52.519 --> 00:37:53.599
This is... what's-his-name.

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:54.280
It doesn't matter.

00:37:54.559 --> 00:37:55.119
I'll introduce myself.

00:37:56.079 --> 00:37:56.440
Hello.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.320
I'm his most important friend.

00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.000
My name is Li Wai.

00:38:00.039 --> 00:38:00.679
Wei Mingtian.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.599
Although not as handsome as me,

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.679
he looks decent enough.

00:38:09.159 --> 00:38:10.039
Could he be a love rival?

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.079
Why does he keep staring at me?

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:13.960
It's just too weird.

00:38:15.079 --> 00:38:16.480
Is there something wrong with his brain?

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:25.760
Mom.

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.079
That kid Li Wai,

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:30.599
seems like he wants to be my stepdad.

00:38:32.159 --> 00:38:33.119
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.039
I watched him grow up.

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.599
You need to remember that yourself.

00:38:38.079 --> 00:38:39.639
Don't ruin my reputation in my old age,

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.119
and make things awkward for me.

00:38:42.199 --> 00:38:43.000
Are you done yet?

00:38:43.119 --> 00:38:43.559
Behave yourself.

00:38:43.559 --> 00:38:44.559
Bring me the steamer.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:52.440
Open it.

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:57.639
You should head back early.

00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:58.960
Your mom must be waiting anxiously.

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:01.360
I'll bring some good food again tomorrow.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:02.840
Thanks for your hospitality.

00:39:03.119 --> 00:39:03.800
We'll get going then.

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:04.199
Okay.

00:39:04.239 --> 00:39:04.800
Go, go, go.

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:05.440
Text me when you get home.

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:06.920
Okay. Bye-bye. Get some rest.

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.199
Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

00:39:10.039 --> 00:39:10.400
Let's go.

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:11.360
Bye, Brother Li Wai.

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:12.760
Bye-bye.

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:13.880
Let's say bye downstairs. Let's go.

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.039
I'm leaving now.

00:39:15.519 --> 00:39:16.000
Going home first.

00:39:16.159 --> 00:39:17.000
Let's go, home.

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:23.079
You live here?

00:39:24.119 --> 00:39:24.840
Yeah, I live right here.

00:39:26.599 --> 00:39:27.119
Mingtian.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.360
Didn't we say we'd review those wrong answers?

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.239
Remember to come over in a bit.

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:31.719
Then I'll find you in a bit.

00:39:31.719 --> 00:39:32.079
Okay.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:32.639
Wait,

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:34.599
you haven't left yet?

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:36.559
Text me when you get home.

00:39:36.639 --> 00:39:37.119
Okay, hurry back.

00:39:37.599 --> 00:39:38.000
Um...

00:39:47.239 --> 00:39:47.679
Bro.

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:48.199
Bro.

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.360
Cousin is too dangerous right now.

00:39:49.679 --> 00:39:51.360
For her safety and my future happiness,

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:52.480
I'm staying at your place today.

00:39:52.679 --> 00:39:53.880
It's more dangerous for you here. Go back.

00:39:54.119 --> 00:39:54.440
No, no, no.

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:54.639
Get lost.

00:39:54.639 --> 00:39:55.000
Bro.

00:39:55.119 --> 00:39:55.360
Get lost.

00:39:55.519 --> 00:39:56.519
I want to ask you one last question.

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.800
Is there any place for rent nearby?

00:39:59.000 --> 00:39:59.519
There are places for sale.

00:39:59.679 --> 00:40:00.280
Go on. Go back.

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:01.159
Give it up. Give up.

00:40:01.239 --> 00:40:01.960
Go, go, go.

00:40:03.239 --> 00:40:03.599
Come back.

00:40:04.519 --> 00:40:05.639
I knew you'd take me in.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:06.519
The trash. Thanks.

00:40:11.159 --> 00:40:12.000
You took a leave of absence?
