WEBVTT

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.620
Where should we go next?

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.010
Than used to flirt with me
back in school.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.840
Just accept his feelings,
what are you waiting for?

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.740
We just started flirting,
let's take it slow for now.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.130
Nene, close your eyes.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.460
Saranghae.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.610
Now that I'm courting you again,
do I have a chance?

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.030
If you're not gonna tell the truth,
don't call it an explanation.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.840
This song is meant
for someone special.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.210
But I haven’t had the chance yet.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.270
Today, may I ask for permission?

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:58.800
Excuse me.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.750
Hello, Meya. Where are you?

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.190
Hello, this is from
Ramkhamhaeng Hospital 2.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:42.800
Mom.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.010
Are you okay, Mom?
Is anything hurting?

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.000
I'm fine,
I just fainted from dizziness.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.690
When the hospital called,
I was really worried.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.030
I think I’ll be able to
go home tomorrow.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.829
How about you?
How was the play at school?

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.230
I wanted you to watch it.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.540
I'll send you the pictures.
Lots of parents who took them.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.870
Next time,
I won’t miss it, I promise.

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:09.550
Let’s pinky promise.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.950
The other hand?

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.690
Okay.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.260
Are you tired?
Should I have him take you home?

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.560
No, I will stay here.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.940
But she needs to rest, Mawin.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.710
No, no, no, I'll stay here.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.460
I can sleep right here.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.950
Come here, scoot over.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.340
Should I stay with you?

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.350
It's okay, you can go home.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.570
Okay.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.920
Then you stay here with your mom.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.700
His clothes are in the car.
I’ll grab them for you.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.110
I’ll come pick him up
tomorrow afternoon.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.310
Thank you.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.140
Goodbye.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.440
Goodbye.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.220
Goodbye.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:49.750
Goodbye.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.930
So, how was it? Did you have fun?

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.410
- Yes, it was fun.
- What role did you play?

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:07.620
This place.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:16.870
This place again?

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:17.990
Why?

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:19.500
Isn't it good?

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.140
It’s good.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.900
If we're sure a restaurant is good,

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.990
why take a chance with
a different one?

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.750
Or do you want me
to keep switching?

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.450
Sure, that's fine.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.150
That's true.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.820
Good stuff, great flavors.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.470
If it's tasty,

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.500
no need to change.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.080
You go order first.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.130
Do you know what I want to eat?

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.030
I need to use the restroom.

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.220
Hello.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.250
I'll have one of these,
and one of these.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.520
And two pineapple juices, please.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.890
Hey, Pond!

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.600
- Hi, Toon.
- Are you here alone?

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.560
Who are you with?

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.190
Oh, I'm with Ek.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.830
- Max.
- Oh.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.200
He's Max.
So are you here alone or not?

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.250
Never mind, I won't ask.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.570
This mall likes to keep
things a secret.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.210
- Right.
- Huh?

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.090
You're being sneaky, Mr. Tiger.

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.270
Let's sit at that table
over there, Ek.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:07.180
Max.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.120
Let’s sit over there, Max.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:15.230
Pond probably doesn’t want us
to see who he’s with.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.470
Don't forget next week,
there's a meeting about the new product.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:23.850
Oh, okay.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:31.910
Let's go.

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:46.150
Let’s change restaurant.
See you at the car.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.250
About the expenses…

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.480
It's fine, I have insurance.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:21.920
Okay, let's go.
We can head back now.

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:29.150
Are you okay?

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.060
You’ve been silent since yesterday.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.260
Grandpa, Grandma,
have you seen this picture?

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:49.620
- Let me see.
- Wow!

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:51.330
Do I look pretty?

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:54.720
Of course, Last time you were
a model in an ad.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.160
Now you’re Snow White. Wow.

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:02.030
It's a shame
I couldn't see you on stage.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:05.850
I missed seeing
your beautiful dress on stage.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:08.990
A lot of people
complimented the dress.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:09.720
Really?

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.090
Was the person wearing it pretty?

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:13.780
- Yes, she was pretty too.
- Wow.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.170
Come here, give me a kiss.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.130
Look at this picture.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.540
- Wow, it’s amazing!
- There’s a picture of Mawin too.

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:29.940
And there’s a couple picture too.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.060
Couple picture? Let me see.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:34.480
What’s on your mind, Than?

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:43.320
I don’t know if what I’m about
to do is wrong, Dad.

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:45.820
What’s going on, son?

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.590
If I want to start fresh
with someone,

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.450
but I don’t know if he's already
with someone else,

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.020
what should I do?

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:57.780
Is this about Uncle Kin?

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.980
Water, Uncle.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:20.870
Thank you.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.230
Can I stay another night, please?

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:28.280
Sure, but will you sleep
in your room or in mine?

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:29.700
In your room.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.840
I’ll move my things to your room.

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:40.710
Thanks a lot for taking care of us
like we’re your own family.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.890
No problem,
I don’t have anyone either.

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:46.180
My parents are far away.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:48.750
Having Mawin around
really helps with the loneliness.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.350
So no one is courting you?

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:57.970
People might think
Mawin is your child,

00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:59.150
so they’re too shy to approach.

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.580
I’m still not sure

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:04.570
if I believe in needing
someone else in my life.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.340
Why? Afraid of starting over?

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:10.640
Something like that, I guess.

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:14.900
Sometimes pain just reminds us

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:17.440
how to love better next time.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.130
And what if...

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.520
what if it’s starting over
with the same person?

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:56.900
What’s wrong?

00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.160
You've been quiet the whole way.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:04.430
You barely ate dinner.

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:06.270
Wasn’t it good?

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.110
It was good.

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:13.460
I just feel like some of the dishes

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.390
weren’t right for me.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.730
Are you upset because
we changed restaurant?

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:28.070
I just didn’t want to explain
everything to Too.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:30.770
I understand.

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:34.330
Some people are meant to stay
where no one can see them.

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:39.210
I just didn’t think
I’d be one of those people.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.440
Uncle Than.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:59.860
What are you doing?

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.740
Grandpa and Grandma
asked you to eat dinner.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.670
I’m looking at old pictures.

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:07.850
Here.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:10.550
This is me when he was born.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.270
This is Dad Sun.

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:15.130
How is it? Cute, right?

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:17.850
Here, this is Nene.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.120
This is me in high school.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:28.690
Did you know
Mawin's dad since school?

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.150
Yes, I did.

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.430
This is Uncle Kin in university.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.090
He's two or three years older
than me.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.880
Why are there so many
couple pictures?

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.920
Were you dating?

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:42.530
Such a tease!

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:49.500
Wait, this is the photographer
who took my pictures?

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:51.730
Yeah, you're right.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.290
Pond still looks the same, huh?

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.020
Wow, Dad Sun looks so cool!

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:05.070
Between Dad and Pond,
who’s the better photographer?

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:07.070
Dad Sun for sure.

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:11.040
Let me see.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:14.390
Look, I told you to
bring him to eat.

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:16.170
Both of you disappeared!

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.080
Hurry up!

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:19.550
Grandpa’s waiting. Go eat!

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:20.590
I’ll follow you soon.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.390
Are you hungry?

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.270
Go, run to Grandpa!

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:44.340
Excuse me.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:57.950
You’re not staying for dinner?

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.240
It’s okay,
I have some work to clear up.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.590
Your mom still needs to rest,
don’t be too naughty, okay?

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:06.910
Okay.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.960
I’ll head out now.
Call me if you need anything.

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:13.510
Thanks a lot.

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:15.220
Take care of yourself too.

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:19.950
And if Mawin and I are keeping you
stuck in the past,

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.000
we're ready to move out.

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:26.710
Let’s go, we should eat.

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:28.440
Then we can shower.

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:31.590
Can you read me
a story tonight, Mom?

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:34.980
Of course! How many stories
do you want me to tell?

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.920
- Two.
- Two? Really?

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:39.460
How about just one?

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:40.600
Okay.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:00.830
Nene, eat more, sweetie.

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:04.520
Look at the picture with Mawin.
He’s way taller!

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:07.090
Aren’t you the same age?

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:09.410
Were they born in the same year?

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:11.600
Yes, they're in the same grade.

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:13.840
I think Mawin was born
just a few months later.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:14.650
Really?

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.120
Being small is cute.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.140
A girl should be delicate, huh?

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:21.560
Grandma.

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:25.170
Whether big or small, girl or boy,

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:27.820
she needs to eat and stay strong.
She's still growing.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:29.360
Eat a lot, dear.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.470
Mawin's dad is tall, too.

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:34.130
Your dad is tall, too.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.120
Tomorrow is the 5th year
your dad passed away.

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:40.820
Let’s wake up early and offer alms.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.050
Okay, that way Dad Sun
will be happy up there.

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:49.050
I’ve already prepared it.

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:54.350
Than, what about Akin?

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:56.310
Are you going for it
or backing off?

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.820
Are you going to date him?

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.350
I support it!

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.950
What about Mawin's mom?
Is she still around?

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.280
Should I investigate for you?

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:18.790
If you love someone,
you have to be sure first

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:20.369
that no one is waiting
for him at home.

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:27.140
Love isn’t wrong.

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:31.140
It’s wrong if you love
the wrong person,

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.830
at the wrong time,
or against moral standards.

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:37.030
Like when I met your Mom,
she already had a boyfriend.

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:39.140
- Really?
- Yep.

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:42.990
But I didn’t think of stealing her
or doing anything to break them up.

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:46.220
So what did you do?

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:49.180
I stayed in the role of a friend.

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:51.430
A well-meaning person.

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:58.100
I believe that true love starts by
not trying to steal someone away.

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:02.030
It should begin when they’re free,

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:05.060
and you’re there beside them.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:09.420
If you want your love to last,

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.670
the beginning must be pure.

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:19.560
And do you love Grandpa?

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:21.730
I do.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:27.320
So why did you choose him?

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:28.040
I'm handsome.

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:29.670
Very handsome.

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:30.970
Yes.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.210
The reason I love him.

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.870
is because he didn’t try
to be the perfect man,

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:41.000
but he tried to stay by my side

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:43.850
through every day
that wasn’t perfect.

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:46.310
He didn’t rush to win my heart,

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:48.620
but waited for the day I was ready.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.160
And he always stayed there.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:54.490
Thank you.

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:57.010
Than.

00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.850
Don’t let your feelings lead you

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:04.060
to hurt someone else’s family
without realizing it, okay?

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:06.510
Yes, Dad.

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:14.810
Wow, that was so insightful.

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:16.520
Do you know what it is?

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:21.000
- You're quiet.
- Do you know?

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.110
- Do you know?
- She does. She knows.

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:27.360
- Eat a lot so you can grow big.
- Still not finished.

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:30.860
When you take a picture with Mawin,
you have to be taller than him.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.810
- Yes, Nene.
- No, I won't accept that.

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:50.030
It's never locked.

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:09.300
Why lock the door today?

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.380
Just wanted to try it

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:14.100
to see how it feels

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.920
if I have to shower alone.

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:53.300
Some people are meant to stay
where no one can see them.

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:55.830
I just don’t think
I’m one of those people.

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.420
Ready for the meeting?

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.600
Today, we have
Indy and Pond online.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:52.970
For the clients, we have Mr.Don,
Mind, and the marketing team.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.920
Let’s go ahead and get started.

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:57.230
The others will join
as they log in.

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:58.020
- Okay.
- Alright.

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:01.800
AJ, let’s not have any problems
like last time, okay?

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:04.080
I’ve checked.
The issue was the internet.

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:06.380
This time, it’s all good.

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:14.750
Oh, what’s that sound?

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:17.810
Oh, sorry. I forgot to mute my mic.

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:20.840
When the mics are close,
it makes that sound.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.530
Oh, sorry. That was mine.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:31.970
Oh, okay.

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:33.780
Hello, Mr.Don.

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:35.500
Is everyone ready?

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:38.770
We’re still waiting for Pond.
I’ll call him to get online.

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:41.970
Please wait a moment.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.970
Pond is the only one missing.
I’m calling him now.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:08.700
Yes?

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:14.240
Okay, if everyone’s ready,
let’s start the meeting.

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:17.890
Pond, did you get
the reference I sent?

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:20.060
Is there anything
you’d like to add?

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:21.120
Just follow that, please.

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:21.880
Okay.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:25.580
Mr.Don, when would you like to
schedule the first round of review?

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:29.920
Here comes the sound again.

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:31.360
Who hasn’t muted their mic?

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:33.070
I’ve muted mine.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.320
Why is the sound still here?

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:39.530
Sorry about that.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.560
It’s probably because my mic
and Don’s are too close.

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:00.110
Okay...

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:04.210
Before the end of the month.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:08.180
Let’s end the meeting for today.

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:10.100
Thank you, everyone.

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:11.860
Goodbye.

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:13.010
Goodbye.

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:19.860
How did Pond get
into Mr.Don’s room?

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:25.060
Pond might have just gone
to a meeting at his office.

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:26.750
But that’s not an office.

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.580
It’s like a room in a condo.

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:31.840
Or maybe Pond went to
fix something for him.

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:34.020
Fix what? Air conditioner?

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:36.100
No, I saw the other day...

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:39.090
AJ, don’t gossip about clients.

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:41.680
Didn’t you learn that from him?
Don’t you remember?

00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:45.160
But honestly, Fai,
I want to know about this too.

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:46.060
Bro.

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:48.570
Never mind, if it’s something
we shouldn’t know,

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:50.350
let’s not try to find out.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.900
If they’re not uncomfortable
keeping it a secret,

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:56.370
we shouldn’t feel uncomfortable
pretending we don’t know anything.

00:24:56.860 --> 00:25:00.050
Have you ever heard?
A secret never hurts anyone,

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:02.260
except the person
who has to keep it.

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:06.660
What makes it tiring is not
keeping it a secret,

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.100
but pretending that
it doesn’t exist.

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:11.610
It sounds easy to understand.

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:13.950
But I don’t get it at all.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:15.990
Bro, do you understand?

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:34.900
Why did you do that?

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:39.250
I don’t want to hide anymore.

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:43.700
We agreed on this, didn’t we?
I thought we talked about it.

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:45.440
If people know about us,

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.610
it won’t be good for you.
It won’t look professional.

00:25:57.450 --> 00:25:58.320
And they might think

00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:02.390
that I like your work
and had you take photos for me

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:06.060
it’s not because of your skill
but something personal.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.950
And they could think
all sorts of things.

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:17.770
Who would think that?

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:20.690
If you mean Beyond Perfect,

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:24.160
they saw my work, they trust me.

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:27.100
They won’t question
why I got this or that job.

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:29.150
Because I’m a skilled photographer.

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.980
And I’m confident that
every job you choose me for,

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:34.850
it’s because I’m good,
and I’m good enough.

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:40.250
And I believe that
you’re professional enough

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:43.960
not to choose me because
of our personal relationship.

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:54.330
Or maybe you’re still not sure

00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:58.480
if you really want me in your life.

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:12.460
I’m just not ready.

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:24.060
Not ready to accept it
or not ready to reveal it

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.180
that actually you and I
might not really be suited.

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:30.040
- But..
- It’s okay.

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:36.870
I understand.

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:46.130
But I can't stay in the shadows,

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:48.310
in your secret

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.030
any longer.

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:38.920
Mawin, can I ask you something?

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.090
Sure, what do you want to ask?

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:45.390
But you have to promise me first
that you won’t tell anyone.

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:47.670
Okay, what is it?

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:52.380
Where is Mawin’s mom?

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.870
Why haven’t I seen her?

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.040
My mom has a coffee shop
far from here.

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:00.760
Far from the condo.

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:04.390
On weekends,
I go visit her at the cafe.

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:07.090
She makes delicious pastries.
She makes them herself.

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.440
I’ll bring some to you next time.

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.800
Hmm, but why...

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:16.400
Why don’t your parents live together?

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.300
Your parents don’t
live together either.

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:22.700
I only see Uncle Than,
Grandpa, and Grandma.

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:24.220
Where are your parents?

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.170
My parents? Oh...

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:32.620
My dad is in heaven, far away.

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:37.930
But he passed away
before I was born.

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:39.870
Oh...

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:44.070
Where did your parents meet?

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:45.610
I don’t know either.

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:47.590
Maybe at the cafe.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:49.970
But...

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:57.460
Your dad knew Uncle Than when
he was still in his school uniform.

00:29:58.340 --> 00:29:59.300
And so?

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:03.050
It means he came before your mom.

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:04.770
What’s wrong with that?

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:08.120
I want Uncle Than
to date Uncle Kin.

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.430
I want that too, sure.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:18.410
But your dad already has your mom.
He can’t have another one.

00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:19.940
Did you forget?

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:22.670
Just let him have two partners.

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:27.050
No, he can only have one. No, no!

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:30.180
- Yes, yes, yes.
- No, no, no!

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:32.590
What are you two talking about?

00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:39.440
Why are you doing that
zipper-mouth gesture?

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:45.660
Oh, I see, you’re playing
the “forbidden word” game?

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:50.500
Can I play too? Please?
Let me join.

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:52.180
Let’s go, we should head back.

00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:53.980
Do you have homework today?

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.070
Yes, I do.

00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:57.550
- Dad.
- Yes?

00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:00.950
I want to know if it’s okay
to have more than one partner.

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:04.530
Is that your homework, Mawin?
Why are you asking that?

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:08.640
Nene said a person
can only have one partner.

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:11.830
But I think it’s okay
to have more than one.

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:16.140
Why are you two talking about this?
Or is it...

00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:20.250
Oh, it's just a curious age.
You know, kids being kids.

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:22.240
Right?

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:24.990
Let's go. Time to head home.

00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:28.630
You can finish your homework,
and after that, we’ll go swimming.

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:32.150
Who wants to go swimming?

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:33.150
Raise your hands.

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:35.960
You want to go? Okay, let's go!

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.890
- Let’s go. Time to head back.
- You're all messy now.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.150
Be careful on the stairs.

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.540
Nene, what did you tell him?

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:49.300
Troublemaker.

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:08.670
Hey, what’s up with you?
You used to be strong,

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:10.240
now you're like a sad dog.

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:16.100
I don’t know if it hurts

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.070
because I’m hidden

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:23.780
or does it hurt because
I allowed myself to be hidden?

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:28.400
What kind of love needs
to be hidden like this?

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:36.020
Damn, how can you and him
still call it love?

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:52.380
Thanks for making me realize that
I’m just a shadow of the relationship.

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:53.380
I’m not the real one.

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:18.000
(The world thinks we’re not
right for each other.)

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:22.090
(If we date someone different,
what if the world thinks we’re not suited?)

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:24.760
(What should we do if the world thinks
we’re not right for each other?)

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:02.840
(Just go our separate ways because
we deal with what others think.)

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:04.800
(The world always makes people
who are suited for us.

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:06.070
(If you still love them,
don’t let go.)

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:08.100
(Differences aren’t a problem
if you’re sure about your feelings.)

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:10.670
(You don’t love him,
you love yourself.)

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.570
(If you loved him enough,
this question wouldn’t even exist.)

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:14.400
(It’s a pity,
shouldn’t you try to fix things?)

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.900
(If both of you are uncomfortable,
just separate easily.)

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.630
(Is it the world or you
who says you’re not suited?)

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:22.270
(Put your ego down.)

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:40.630
I think you’ve had enough.

00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:43.699
Even if you drink,
you still won’t forget about him.

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:46.260
You’ll just forget what
you’re supposed to do next.

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:48.920
Or is it my fault?

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:53.870
Is it my fault for being this way?

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:17.660
Are you okay?

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:21.520
Why did you drink so much?

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:25.070
You’re here in this bar?

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:28.340
It’s not really fitting for you.

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:31.480
But maybe it’s safer

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:33.710
because no one will see you.

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:36.000
People around here

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:38.350
are just like me.

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:41.270
I’m sorry.

00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:44.600
Maybe I didn’t care enough
about you.

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:48.810
But it’s not that
I don’t feel anything.

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:53.890
I understand.

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:57.170
But look at your situation and mine.

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:01.560
Even from Mars, anyone would know
that we’re not suited for each other.

00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:07.030
The hidden corners you’ve given me

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.730
have now become
where I can’t breathe.

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:15.110
Let’s go talk in the room.

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:20.210
In the room?

00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:24.200
I guess I only matter to you
when I’m in the room.

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:29.060
There’s also a room behind the bar.

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:33.450
Do you want to try?
Change the mood a bit.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:35.850
I assure you no one will know.

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:38.020
You’ve drunk too much.

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:43.790
If you feel something for me,

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:46.590
you wouldn’t have to hide me.

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:54.440
I’m tired of being hidden.

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:56.370
You should go.

00:37:15.730 --> 00:37:16.690
I’ve left the keycard here.

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:19.900
You can come whenever you want.

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:24.840
But please come.

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:34.240
The person who’s right
for you isn’t me.

00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:00.310
I think you need to change.

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:03.870
If you don’t want to be
just a shadow,

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:08.410
you’ll have to be brave enough
to make him stand by you openly.

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:02.210
The light in my room went out.

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:05.170
Yes, it's really hot too.

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:07.900
But my room doesn't go out.

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:09.540
It should’ve gone out
for the whole floor.

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:10.920
I called the building management.

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:13.250
They said it’s probably
the electrical box in my room.

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:14.930
They’ll send someone
to check tomorrow.

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:19.850
Uncle Than and I wanted to ask you

00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:24.130
to let us stay the night here.

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:25.840
Yes.

00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:28.590
We can sleep on the couch

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:31.430
because we can sleep anywhere.

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:39.570
Go.

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.660
Nene and I can sleep here.

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.060
Comfortable, right, Nene?

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:55.710
- Yes.
- It’s fine.

00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:57.850
I’ll have Mawin sleep in my room.

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:01.090
You sleep here,
Nene will sleep in his room.

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:03.010
The bed is small,
you probably can’t sleep.

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:08.340
Hello, Uncle.

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:09.870
Hello, Nene.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.020
Nene and I will stay here
for the night.

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:17.150
Yes, the power’s out in our room
and it’s really hot.

00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:17.940
Sure.

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:20.990
You go grab you things
and sleep in my room.

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:22.640
Okay.

00:40:23.330 --> 00:40:25.810
Nene, put the pillow and blanket
in the room.

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:27.740
Then help Mawin with his things.

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:32.010
Let's go.

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:50.230
I've never seen your mom stay here.

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:53.650
My mom? She’s only been here twice.

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:57.450
Sometimes she comes to drop by,
sometimes just to visit.

00:40:58.090 --> 00:41:00.430
But she’s never stayed the night.

00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:07.670
And your dad has ever stayed
at your mom’s house?

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:12.420
Never. My dad only drops by
and then leaves.

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:14.110
Nene, why do you ask?

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:17.100
Uncle Than asked me…

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:22.540
Uh… I just said it casually.

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:25.560
Have you ever met your mom?

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:30.460
We’re talking on the phone.

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:32.020
And also via video call.

00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:34.630
She said she would come visit too.

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:37.100
But I don’t know when she’ll come.

00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:45.510
There aren’t any family photos
in your room.

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:49.400
Why?

00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:52.670
Usually, there’d be pictures of
parents and children on the wall

00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:54.590
or on a table, something like that.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:00.010
I meant to ask last time
I stayed here.

00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:04.320
There you go.

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:09.230
I’m going to sleep now.

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:13.150
Thank you, Uncle.

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:15.150
- Good night.
- Yes, good night.

00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:18.240
Good night, Uncle.

00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:19.790
Good night, Nene.

00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:31.630
I’ll sleep first.

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:35.330
Good night.

00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:36.990
Kin.

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:41.490
- Hello, Mr. Don.
- Hello.

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:44.630
Hello.

00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:49.150
Please, come in.

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:00.770
Shall we get started?

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:01.890
Yes.

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:04.410
Mind will explain the details
of the new product.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.240
One moment, please.

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:13.000
Oh, cosmetics?

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:15.040
Mind, this is the wrong file.

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:20.530
Ah, just a moment.

00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:23.400
Let me help you.

00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:26.590
Ah, this one.

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:28.270
Thank you.

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:33.780
Okay.

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.110
The product is a mattress.

00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:40.520
- It has innovation from Japan.
- From Japan.

00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:44.340
The company has been
established for 459 years.

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:46.230
- 459 years, wow.
- Yes.

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:49.900
It helps improve sleep efficiency

00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:51.930
especially for people who exercise.

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:54.430
It’s suitable for those
who like to work out.

00:44:54.830 --> 00:44:57.470
It should help with
weight distribution, right?

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:00.820
- Yes, it’s good.
- Maybe we could target runners.

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:02.870
- Okay, I’ll look into that.
- Yes.

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:06.140
Okay, we accept the brief.

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:09.870
And Beyond Perfect needs
no more than a week.

00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:12.380
The product’s character is
quite clear.

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:14.330
I think we can do
a lot of fun stuff.

00:45:14.530 --> 00:45:18.260
For the still photography,
we’ll use Pond as usual.

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:20.490
I don’t mind.

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:23.110
But if he’s taking this job,

00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:24.860
he should attend the meeting.

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:28.370
He’s probably busy.

00:45:28.370 --> 00:45:30.570
I called this morning,
and he didn’t pick up either.

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:31.560
- Right.
- Yes.

00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:35.430
Might be good to have
another photographer as backup.

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:37.640
I’m not attached to
any particular person.

00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:41.590
As long as the work
comes out perfect, I’m fine.

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:42.990
Got it.

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:46.820
- I’ll look for a backup.
- I’ll check on photographers too.

00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:47.700
Sure, bro.

00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:53.920
Sorry for being late.

00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:55.940
My alarm didn’t go off.

00:45:56.970 --> 00:45:58.090
We've already finished.

00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:00.940
You definitely won’t pass.

00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:14.930
Thank you.

00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:17.550
- I'll see you off.
- You go, Fai.

00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:19.170
I'll see him off.

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:26.880
So embarrassing.

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:28.820
Don’t be late again.

00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:30.610
- Don’t do this again.
- Yeah.

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:48.530
How can I get over breakup
in one day.

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:53.530
You can’t fix the past in a day,

00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:56.210
but you can download
a dating app in a minute.

00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:06.500
How can I get over a breakup fast?

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:11.960
Move on, dress up, go outside,
find someone who sees you.

00:47:59.170 --> 00:47:59.890
Ouch.

00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:01.990
Stressful.

00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:07.370
Good thing the first branch is
still making revenue.

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:10.990
Otherwise, it’d be even more stressful.

00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:15.880
Oh, right, bro.

00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:18.300
Bro.

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:20.980
Is it possible

00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:23.050
that a husband and wife

00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:25.550
have never stayed overnight
in the same condo?

00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:29.250
Or never stayed overnight
at each other’s house?

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:31.330
Are they living completely separately?

00:48:32.370 --> 00:48:33.380
Just raising the child together?

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:36.710
Yeah, like couples who are divorced.

00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:44.840
Kin and Mawin's mom
might be divorced.

00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:47.830
But they’re still doing
their roles as parents.

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:49.160
Could be possible.

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:55.290
Mawin’s mom has never stayed
overnight at his condo even once.

00:48:55.790 --> 00:48:58.100
He has never stayed
at her house either.

00:48:59.250 --> 00:49:01.580
I think I heard him
alking on the phone…

00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:04.290
It does sound a bit strange.

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:07.050
Strange how, bro?

00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:13.460
Don’t worry.
He is like my kid anyway.

00:49:14.770 --> 00:49:16.470
I’ll send you the clip
from the shoot later.

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:45.380
Have you been waiting long?

00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:47.960
Half an hour.

00:49:50.610 --> 00:49:51.900
You should’ve said “not long.”

00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:54.020
No need to be that blunt
with everyone.

00:49:54.730 --> 00:49:57.050
This guy might not
handle it like I do.

00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:03.910
Shall we order?

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:23.740
I’ll have the burrata
with cherry tomatoes, please.

00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:28.290
And for the main course,
grilled sea bass with asparagus purée.

00:50:31.330 --> 00:50:32.120
I’ll have this one.

00:50:33.070 --> 00:50:35.330
For the main, lobster risotto.

00:50:35.850 --> 00:50:38.720
But no onions,
and no olive oil, please.

00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:41.550
And could the chef use a stock
without any animal products?

00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:43.120
Plant-based, please.

00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:46.510
And for the cheese,
switch to organic Parmesan.

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:49.550
Wow, that’s a lot of requests.

00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:51.830
The chef should come out
and smack him.

00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:56.080
But he seems perfect for you,
you’re just as picky.

00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:57.980
A perfect match.

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:04.070
Sparkling water,
medium cold, no ice.

00:51:04.450 --> 00:51:06.350
And absolutely no lemon, please.

00:51:06.370 --> 00:51:08.220
Last time you gave me lemon in it.

00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:12.850
Hmm, your glass isn’t suitable.

00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:15.870
If he drinks that,
his throat will feel irritated.

00:51:16.330 --> 00:51:19.360
If you’re dating him,
you’ll need a new fridge.

00:51:29.830 --> 00:51:31.470
What kind of business do you do?

00:51:32.050 --> 00:51:33.990
Oh, I…

00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:38.840
Wait a moment, please.

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:54.470
I might not be someone
from your world

00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:56.720
if you’re looking for
someone “suitable.”

00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:00.990
All I have is simplicity
and sincerity.

00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:03.410
And that might not be enough.

00:52:09.690 --> 00:52:10.660
Never had a boyfriend?

00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:12.070
Hmm.

00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:17.220
- Maybe it’s your personality.
- Hey.

00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:44.360
If your world is full of
perfection and suitability,

00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:50.320
let me be a simple person
who loves you

00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:52.780
and always has you in my world.

00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:55.110
Is that okay?

00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:01.390
Dad, Uncle Than and Nene.

00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:03.910
The power’s out again?

00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:05.630
No.

00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:09.380
Uncle and I bought
some ice cream for you.

00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:12.270
We just went out to eat.

00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:14.290
We passed this shopม I remembered

00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:16.740
you used to buy it
when we were still...

00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:17.860
Thank you.

00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:25.830
This one’s for you, Marwin.
I remember you like this flavor.

00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:28.110
Thank you, Nene.

00:54:28.510 --> 00:54:29.520
Thanks, Nene.

00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:35.520
I don’t mean to interfere
between anyone, bro.

00:54:36.450 --> 00:54:37.330
I just want to know...

00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:39.050
- You and his mom...
- Marwin.

00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:41.370
- You’re sleepy now, right?
- Yes.

00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:46.310
We’ll talk about it later.

00:54:47.410 --> 00:54:49.640
Say good night to
Uncle Than and Nene.

00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:51.950
Good night, Nene.
Good night, Uncle.

00:54:52.170 --> 00:54:53.170
Good night, Mawin.

00:54:53.550 --> 00:54:54.560
Sweet dreams.

00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:06.480
Nene said Uncle is going to
flirt with you.

00:55:07.010 --> 00:55:10.180
So she asked me to help.
Do you like him, Dad?

00:55:11.290 --> 00:55:12.600
You should go to sleep now.

00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:14.740
Your mom will pick you up
tomorrow evening.

00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:16.700
- Really?
- Really.

00:55:18.130 --> 00:55:19.440
Let’s go, champ.

00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:25.470
It’s okay. Let’s try again. Go.

00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:49.120
Have you eaten yet?

00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:52.350
I made spaghetti for you.
Come eat with me.

00:55:56.260 --> 00:55:57.310
I’m starving.

00:56:09.110 --> 00:56:10.490
What are you hungry for?

00:56:13.350 --> 00:56:14.430
What’s there to eat?

00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:18.480
Then come take a look yourself.

00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:42.170
Switching from
photographer to model?

00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:35.210
Don’t let “what if,” “but,” or “wait”

00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:37.430
become obstacles in your life.

00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:40.010
If the past makes you hesitate,

00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:41.640
leave it behind.

00:57:41.970 --> 00:57:44.700
Oh, are you going off to
war or something?

00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:45.580
Are you ready?

00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:48.140
If you’re ready, let’s do this.

00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:51.710
One, two, three. Good.

00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:53.630
I want you to meet someone.

00:57:54.130 --> 00:57:55.130
Hello.

00:57:55.340 --> 00:58:00.440
Let's start over
our relationship again, Kin.
