WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000


00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.423
P'Fah’s pretty good at this too, huh.

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:18.571
Today, I actually met him.

00:00:19.207 --> 00:00:19.880
Who was it?

00:00:20.493 --> 00:00:21.531
The person from the letter.

00:00:24.248 --> 00:00:25.985
Nice to meet you.

00:00:26.462 --> 00:00:27.896
The one from the letter.

00:00:28.208 --> 00:00:29.768
Nice to love you.

00:00:31.595 --> 00:00:33.060
Dad, Mom.

00:00:33.245 --> 00:00:34.411
We are dating.

00:00:34.957 --> 00:00:36.198
It feels impossible.

00:00:36.792 --> 00:00:38.028
But today, I got my answer.

00:01:03.608 --> 00:01:05.250
I’m here to submit my resignation documents.

00:01:18.103 --> 00:01:19.810
So how did it go? Was everything settled?

00:01:22.798 --> 00:01:24.568
I thought you would burst into tears.

00:01:26.757 --> 00:01:27.915
I'm grown up now.

00:01:28.863 --> 00:01:29.808
Maybe it’s because

00:01:30.063 --> 00:01:31.807
there’s something I like waiting ahead.

00:01:32.128 --> 00:01:33.727
And if I submit my scores and get accepted here again,

00:01:34.091 --> 00:01:35.308
I’ll get to see my friends,

00:01:36.177 --> 00:01:36.906
and also

00:01:37.557 --> 00:01:38.894
stay with you.

00:01:39.435 --> 00:01:40.882
That already makes me happy enough.

00:01:43.031 --> 00:01:44.232
You really have grown up.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.351
Then should we head back now?

00:01:50.188 --> 00:01:53.320
Oh right, I should tell those two first.

00:01:56.606 --> 00:01:59.570
I submitted my resignation today.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.760
I won’t let you leave.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.753
Don’t be clingy. You don’t have to miss me too much,
because I’m submitting my portfolio here anyway.

00:02:08.286 --> 00:02:10.313
Then you should call me your senior.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.460
I order you, junior Phoon—ten push-ups! Execute!

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.126
Yeah, when the semester starts, you’ll definitely see me.

00:02:18.497 --> 00:02:20.816
Phoon, do you want to stop anywhere?

00:02:22.617 --> 00:02:24.565
Can we stop by the dorm first? I want to get my clothes.

00:02:27.017 --> 00:02:30.035
Phoon, would you like to move in with me?

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.005
You mean your condo?

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.188
Yes.

00:02:38.807 --> 00:02:42.810
Please. Even staying with you for a short while makes me really happy.

00:02:42.971 --> 00:02:44.834
If we could stay together all the time, it would be amazing.

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:46.666
Please.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.366
You won’t get bored of me, right?

00:02:50.631 --> 00:02:54.802
No way. That way, you won’t have to go back and forth between our rooms anymore.

00:02:58.798 --> 00:03:00.005
Then P'Fah has to help me move.

00:03:00.423 --> 00:03:04.684
I helped you move in—why wouldn’t I help you move out?

00:03:17.074 --> 00:03:20.105
Looks like there are way more cameras than when you moved in.

00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:27.318
P'Fah.

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:29.057
Yes?

00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:30.240
About Fun…

00:03:31.017 --> 00:03:33.589
I didn’t tell Uncle and Auntie directly,

00:03:33.651 --> 00:03:36.362
so I don’t really feel at ease.

00:03:41.265 --> 00:03:42.370
Don’t overthink it.

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:44.934
I believe my parents will understand.

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:54.728
Let’s go back and tell Dad and Mom together later.

00:04:06.662 --> 00:04:09.577
So this is the gift you think your mom sent you?

00:04:10.713 --> 00:04:11.860
What does it say inside?

00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:14.450
“To: Ren.”

00:04:14.862 --> 00:04:18.318
Let me guess—Ren is your old name?

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:21.499
Who sent it?

00:04:21.583 --> 00:04:22.631
Your mom?

00:04:23.973 --> 00:04:24.882
I wish it were.

00:04:26.728 --> 00:04:29.857
If you think your mom sent it, do you want to see her?

00:04:30.173 --> 00:04:31.112
I do.

00:04:33.623 --> 00:04:36.293
Why, can it transform or something?

00:04:38.413 --> 00:04:40.376
A limited-edition robot.

00:04:40.765 --> 00:04:42.902
Produced in early 2008 in Japan.

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:45.722
Whoa, how do you know that?

00:04:46.157 --> 00:04:47.139
I used to collect them.

00:04:48.431 --> 00:04:49.400
I think that’s it.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.717
The name’s Ren.

00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:55.814
Sounds Japanese. Or is your mom Japanese?

00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:01.361
P'Fah.

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:06.085
You said you’d take me anywhere I want to go.

00:05:06.828 --> 00:05:08.520
Now I know where I want to go.

00:07:00.225 --> 00:07:02.330
P'Fah, can we head back now?

00:07:03.573 --> 00:07:06.053
Why? You just got here.

00:07:07.232 --> 00:07:10.023
I didn’t think it would be this cold.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.666
How is it?

00:07:25.351 --> 00:07:26.444
Is it warmer?

00:07:34.994 --> 00:07:35.645
Come on.

00:07:36.478 --> 00:07:37.297
Let’s go.

00:07:54.794 --> 00:07:55.543
P'Fah.

00:08:27.447 --> 00:08:28.509
Careful, little one.

00:08:29.272 --> 00:08:30.678
Slow down, little one.

00:08:31.549 --> 00:08:33.274
P'Fah, look over here. It’s so beautiful.

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:35.770
It really is.

00:08:36.392 --> 00:08:37.191
Thank you.

00:08:42.654 --> 00:08:44.570
You look like one of those wobble dolls.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:03.651
P'Fah, want a photo? I’ll take it for you.

00:09:04.568 --> 00:09:05.786
Right here.

00:09:47.266 --> 00:09:48.401
Thank you.

00:09:50.663 --> 00:09:54.028
Let's eat...right?

00:09:54.565 --> 00:09:55.573
Yes.

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.845
Phoon.

00:11:14.343 --> 00:11:16.152
Then let P'Fah take one of you this time.

00:11:23.948 --> 00:11:25.491
But I think

00:11:26.617 --> 00:11:28.327
it still feels like something’s missing.

00:11:28.973 --> 00:11:30.367
What is it?

00:11:31.025 --> 00:11:32.801
Like, for example…

00:11:36.611 --> 00:11:37.696
Something like this.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.305
Mom’s calling.

00:11:44.973 --> 00:11:45.897
Hi, Mom.

00:11:45.915 --> 00:11:48.992
- How was it, kids? Did you have fun on the trip?
- I did.

00:11:50.586 --> 00:11:51.619
What about you, Fah?

00:11:52.885 --> 00:11:55.014
If Phoon had fun, then I did too.

00:11:55.241 --> 00:11:58.499
That’s good then. Mom and Dad won’t bother you anymore.

00:11:58.954 --> 00:12:00.488
Yes, Mom. See you later.

00:12:01.103 --> 00:12:01.610
Goodbye.

00:12:07.877 --> 00:12:08.543
Phoon.

00:12:09.962 --> 00:12:11.075
About your mom—

00:12:12.752 --> 00:12:14.521
Honestly, I’m not really sure either.

00:12:14.994 --> 00:12:17.780
Whether the things that were sent were really from her.

00:12:18.822 --> 00:12:19.823
But still—

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.926
Deep down, I hope they were from her.

00:12:26.946 --> 00:12:28.650
Coming to Japan, I already knew.

00:12:29.377 --> 00:12:30.699
That I wouldn’t get to see her.

00:12:33.506 --> 00:12:37.510
At least, just being able to breathe a little closer to her is enough for me.

00:12:37.908 --> 00:12:39.874
That’s true.

00:12:59.549 --> 00:13:00.374
How is it?

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:03.100
Do you usually like taking photos?

00:13:05.272 --> 00:13:07.586
I hardly ever even touch a camera.

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:11.562
You don’t like it?

00:13:13.294 --> 00:13:14.035
Just kidding.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.873
- Really?
- Let’s go take photos over there instead.

00:13:19.875 --> 00:13:22.736
Hey, Phoon. Phoon!

00:13:27.539 --> 00:13:28.675
Help me with something.

00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:30.800
What is it?

00:13:32.586 --> 00:13:34.241
Help me look for Phoon’s mom.

00:13:34.854 --> 00:13:35.804
His real mom.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.553
Do you think I’m a private detective or something?

00:13:39.727 --> 00:13:42.262
Are you going to write this term’s lab report yourself?

00:13:43.406 --> 00:13:45.486
Fine, I’m a private detective. I’ll find her for you.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.366
But you have to help me write the report.

00:13:48.983 --> 00:13:50.522
Yeah, I’ll help.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:52.422
Deal.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:01.433
- I’ll hang up now.
- Hey, wait.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.520
It’s—

00:14:08.705 --> 00:14:09.764
Isn’t it strange?

00:14:11.598 --> 00:14:12.597
It’s not strange.

00:14:13.502 --> 00:14:14.705
It’s very cute.

00:14:18.291 --> 00:14:19.102
Really?

00:14:23.705 --> 00:14:24.585
Really.

00:14:28.105 --> 00:14:29.011
Very cute.

00:14:40.745 --> 00:14:42.146
Good boy.

00:14:48.934 --> 00:14:52.687
At first, I thought I’d wait a little longer.

00:14:55.041 --> 00:14:59.065
But now, I can’t wait anymore.

00:15:24.905 --> 00:15:26.281
You’re mine, okay?

00:15:42.548 --> 00:15:47.204
But I have already been yours for a long time, haven’t I?

00:15:49.109 --> 00:15:51.037
I’ll take that as your answer.

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:03.880
Is that okay?

00:17:05.629 --> 00:17:09.457
If it’s P'Fah, then I’m okay with anything.

00:17:10.259 --> 00:17:11.816
I love you, Phoon.

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:14.486
I love you too.

00:17:49.545 --> 00:17:51.582
You’re up early, P'Fah.

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:57.154
You’re the one who woke up late.

00:17:58.857 --> 00:17:59.764
Really?

00:18:01.814 --> 00:18:03.312
Are you okay?

00:18:05.634 --> 00:18:06.992
Okay about what?

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.288
Well—

00:18:09.791 --> 00:18:11.247
Last night—

00:18:13.251 --> 00:18:14.607
I don’t know.

00:18:18.069 --> 00:18:19.349
I’m sorry.

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:23.269
Forget it. I won’t say anything.

00:18:23.482 --> 00:18:25.508
Hey, how can you not say it?

00:18:25.797 --> 00:18:27.524
I were the one who did it.

00:18:29.502 --> 00:18:30.697
Next time—

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:33.038
I’ll be gentler, I promise.

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:34.891
Promise.

00:18:37.482 --> 00:18:39.108
Are you okay?

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.517
Why wouldn’t I be?

00:18:43.937 --> 00:18:47.242
I was afraid you wouldn’t like it.

00:18:49.207 --> 00:18:50.259
Oh.

00:18:51.751 --> 00:18:53.650
Should I prove it to you one more time?

00:18:54.213 --> 00:18:55.410
That I do like it?

00:19:14.007 --> 00:19:14.933
Is it not good?

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:19.088
I don’t want to go back.

00:19:20.579 --> 00:19:22.591
But earlier you said you wanted to go home.

00:19:23.007 --> 00:19:28.205
At first, I wasn’t used to the cold weather,
but now I’m getting used to it.

00:19:29.783 --> 00:19:33.000
Then if you don’t want to go back yet, should we stay another week?

00:19:34.757 --> 00:19:36.345
You need to hurry back to classes.

00:19:36.977 --> 00:19:40.349
And I need to go back and prepare for exams.

00:19:41.346 --> 00:19:42.888
Let’s come back together next time.

00:19:43.878 --> 00:19:44.608
Really?

00:19:45.847 --> 00:19:46.903
Everywhere we want to go?

00:19:48.008 --> 00:19:49.066
Of course.

00:20:02.007 --> 00:20:02.657
Phoon.

00:20:03.965 --> 00:20:05.911
Can I post this photo on Instagram?

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.179
There are so many nice photos. Why did you choose this one?

00:20:09.694 --> 00:20:11.127
Because you look cute in this one.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:12.743
Okay?

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:40.091
Do you want it?

00:20:40.337 --> 00:20:41.671
I want to give it to my friends.

00:21:30.151 --> 00:21:33.992
- Souvenirs from Japan.
- Hey, which one’s mine?

00:21:34.226 --> 00:21:36.259
- This one.
- Pink's mine.

00:21:36.567 --> 00:21:38.678
Pink's yours?
Hey, that’s cute.

00:21:39.117 --> 00:21:41.400
- Thanks.
- Hey, there’s a cat too.

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:42.811
Thanks, Maew.

00:21:44.017 --> 00:21:44.823
It’s pretty cute.

00:21:45.866 --> 00:21:48.922
So how was going to Japan with P'Fah?

00:21:49.168 --> 00:21:52.268
Super sweet, right?

00:21:52.288 --> 00:21:54.985
- What the hell are you talking about?
- You’re going to hurt me again, look.

00:21:55.054 --> 00:21:57.373
- See? You’re blushing.
- I was just curious.

00:21:57.414 --> 00:22:00.428
It was fun, honestly. Even if it was only for a short time.

00:22:00.853 --> 00:22:03.866
Come on, you can go more often.

00:22:04.164 --> 00:22:07.725
Yeah, it really does sound fun. I’ve never been to Japan before—I wanna go too.

00:22:07.859 --> 00:22:08.977
Then why are you telling us?

00:22:09.124 --> 00:22:13.192
All you need is one call, and P'Jo will book the ticket for you.

00:22:14.068 --> 00:22:15.143
That’s nice.

00:22:16.851 --> 00:22:19.487
I just like it when everyone talks about partners.

00:22:19.885 --> 00:22:23.265
I can really feel how warm the atmosphere is.

00:22:24.118 --> 00:22:27.085
What about you? Don’t you have anyone?

00:22:29.724 --> 00:22:30.565
Nope.

00:22:30.986 --> 00:22:33.176
But it’d be nice if someone were there to take care of you.

00:22:33.631 --> 00:22:36.214
- I already have someone important to take care of.
- Hey!

00:22:36.487 --> 00:22:37.370
Who is it?

00:22:37.733 --> 00:22:39.268
Should I tell you?

00:22:39.911 --> 00:22:41.493
Of course, Dao. I wanna know.

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:43.432
Show us. What do they look like? Got a picture?

00:22:55.653 --> 00:22:56.345
Uh…

00:22:57.014 --> 00:22:58.377
Why are you showing me a cat?

00:22:59.192 --> 00:23:01.965
This is my important one.

00:23:02.714 --> 00:23:04.620
Oh.

00:23:05.327 --> 00:23:07.478
- Cute.
- Pretty cute.

00:23:08.204 --> 00:23:11.840
Hurry up and eat, then get to campus. You guys will be late.

00:23:11.856 --> 00:23:15.385
I’m going back to study too.
I’m almost at the score submission exams.

00:23:15.705 --> 00:23:17.588
Don’t forget about me once you leave.

00:23:17.714 --> 00:23:21.823
- Don’t ditch us. Come back too.
- What nonsense are you talking about?

00:23:29.269 --> 00:23:30.127
Fah.

00:23:30.269 --> 00:23:33.300
- Can you check this for me? Is it right?
- Sure.

00:23:38.081 --> 00:23:39.262
Mm, yeah, that’s correct.

00:23:39.943 --> 00:23:41.571
Okay, thanks.

00:23:42.368 --> 00:23:45.654
Hey, that picture you posted on IG—your real boyfriend?

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.591
Yeah. Why?

00:23:47.709 --> 00:23:50.583
- What faculty is he in?
- He’s about to enter Photo.

00:23:51.297 --> 00:23:52.552
Oh.

00:23:53.254 --> 00:23:54.600
- I’ll secretly stalk him.
- Huh?

00:23:55.241 --> 00:23:57.354
Just kidding. You’re pretty possessive, huh.

00:24:03.549 --> 00:24:07.939
Hey Hill, did anyone ever have a crush on Phoon back when he was studying veterinary medicine?

00:24:08.465 --> 00:24:09.682
Yeah, definitely.

00:24:09.995 --> 00:24:11.189
Ter said there were a lot, too.

00:24:11.411 --> 00:24:12.914
Upperclassmen and classmates alike.

00:24:13.251 --> 00:24:14.176
That many?

00:24:14.598 --> 00:24:16.309
Once he enters Photo, there’ll probably be even more.

00:24:16.514 --> 00:24:17.466
Watch out.

00:24:19.777 --> 00:24:22.380
Fah, people are crushing on your boyfriend.

00:24:22.608 --> 00:24:24.262
Don’t you feel anything at all?

00:24:25.574 --> 00:24:28.531
So what if they like him? Phoon only likes me, right?

00:24:33.374 --> 00:24:35.832
I think Hill and Jo are getting annoying now.

00:24:36.234 --> 00:24:38.368
But you’re really the most one.

00:24:41.503 --> 00:24:42.417
You better go back to sleep.

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:57.060
What are you doing, my little one?

00:24:58.106 --> 00:25:00.100
I’m studying.

00:25:02.786 --> 00:25:05.810
Don’t forget to eat. I already sent food over.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.953
So cute. Noted.

00:25:22.272 --> 00:25:25.936
I’m finishing late today. Sorry about that.

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:34.193
Why apologize? You’re focusing on your studies. Don’t worry about me.

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:41.650
Alright. Good luck with your studying too.
I’ll be back soon.

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:01.757
You’re back already?

00:26:02.911 --> 00:26:03.650
Phoon.

00:26:04.194 --> 00:26:05.614
If you’re sleepy, go sleep properly on the bed.

00:26:05.958 --> 00:26:07.520
Sleeping here will give you a headache.

00:26:09.733 --> 00:26:11.234
I can’t get up.

00:26:33.924 --> 00:26:35.983
Are you going to keep studying, P'Fah?

00:26:36.576 --> 00:26:37.213
Yeah.

00:26:38.029 --> 00:26:40.158
You’ve been pushing yourself a lot lately.

00:26:40.628 --> 00:26:42.619
My grades weren’t great last term.

00:26:43.173 --> 00:26:44.580
I want to make up for it this term.

00:26:45.275 --> 00:26:46.281
You can do it.

00:26:47.038 --> 00:26:48.010
Thanks.

00:26:48.657 --> 00:26:50.970
Can I get some encouragement in another way?

00:27:02.282 --> 00:27:02.802
Again.

00:27:06.105 --> 00:27:06.826
Again.

00:27:07.275 --> 00:27:08.139
That’s enough.

00:27:15.362 --> 00:27:16.225
You’ve got this.

00:27:17.145 --> 00:27:17.857
Okay.

00:27:18.314 --> 00:27:19.429
I won’t bother you anymore.

00:27:19.751 --> 00:27:20.475
Good night.

00:27:44.526 --> 00:27:46.860
You little bastard—how dare you not answer my call?

00:27:47.093 --> 00:27:49.693
Don’t think I don’t know that Phrae went to see you.

00:27:49.846 --> 00:27:52.400
- What nonsense are you spouting?
- Uncle.

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:55.746
Tonfah? Why are you…

00:27:55.856 --> 00:27:58.528
Phoon’s asleep. Is there something you’re calling about?

00:27:58.893 --> 00:28:00.917
- Uh…
- If not, I’ll hang up.

00:28:01.131 --> 00:28:02.811
Wait—don’t hang up yet.

00:28:13.102 --> 00:28:13.834
What is it, Kong?

00:28:14.128 --> 00:28:17.945
I heard there’s an investor in Chiang Mai interested in partnering with us.

00:28:18.404 --> 00:28:19.453
They want to talk details first.

00:28:19.908 --> 00:28:21.093
An investor?

00:28:21.571 --> 00:28:22.081
Yeah.

00:28:22.497 --> 00:28:23.364
A big one.

00:28:24.234 --> 00:28:25.325
That’s good.

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:26.869
Then I’ll book the tickets and we’ll go right away.

00:28:27.939 --> 00:28:28.607
Kong.

00:28:29.327 --> 00:28:32.059
What about Phrae—the thing I told you to handle? How’s that going?

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.586
Enough already, Rit.

00:28:34.309 --> 00:28:35.548
Just let Phrae go.

00:28:35.813 --> 00:28:38.865
Shut up. Even if you’re my friend,

00:28:39.117 --> 00:28:41.097
I can still kick you out of this company.

00:28:41.426 --> 00:28:44.647
You’re the one who kept backing that kid until he get spoiled.

00:28:50.013 --> 00:28:52.149
Did you head out early today?

00:28:53.048 --> 00:28:54.481
I had a small errand.

00:28:54.949 --> 00:28:56.281
Once I’m done,

00:28:56.591 --> 00:28:58.041
I’ll hurry back to you, my little one.

00:29:01.312 --> 00:29:03.053
I hope you have a great day today.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:06.700
You too.

00:29:17.197 --> 00:29:19.063
Please have a seat and wait for a moment.

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.700
Hello, Uncle. It’s been a long time.

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:14.549
Tonfah, right? I almost didn’t recognize you.

00:30:14.757 --> 00:30:15.727
How did you end up here?

00:30:16.411 --> 00:30:18.188
The person who contacted you about the investment—

00:30:18.831 --> 00:30:19.865
that was me.

00:30:20.282 --> 00:30:21.583
Don’t tell me…

00:30:21.702 --> 00:30:23.106
the one who’s going to invest with me

00:30:23.303 --> 00:30:24.293
is you, Tonfah?

00:30:26.521 --> 00:30:28.333
But there’s something else I want to talk about more.

00:30:29.041 --> 00:30:29.922
What is it?

00:30:30.357 --> 00:30:31.585
Let me get straight to the point.

00:30:32.962 --> 00:30:34.894
Could you stop interfering with Phoon?

00:30:39.829 --> 00:30:41.137
What did that kid say to you?

00:30:42.054 --> 00:30:44.625
Phoon has never once spoken badly about you.

00:30:45.241 --> 00:30:46.986
Phoon has endured enough already.

00:30:47.755 --> 00:30:49.290
Could you please let him go?

00:30:49.724 --> 00:30:51.885
I never forced that kid to stay with me.

00:30:52.361 --> 00:30:53.921
He just can’t live on his own.

00:30:54.108 --> 00:30:55.345
That’s why he needs me.

00:30:55.854 --> 00:30:57.423
But now Phoon can manage on his own.

00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.453
He doesn’t need you anymore.

00:31:03.797 --> 00:31:05.125
So this means

00:31:05.645 --> 00:31:07.890
that kid has successfully fooled you, hasn’t he?

00:31:10.906 --> 00:31:12.459
How disappointing.

00:31:12.785 --> 00:31:13.684
In the end,

00:31:14.023 --> 00:31:15.611
you’re not that smart after all.

00:31:19.514 --> 00:31:22.238
If you think Typhoon owes you money,

00:31:22.998 --> 00:31:24.674
just tell me the amount.

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:26.700
Money is one thing,

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:28.588
but that kid—

00:31:28.951 --> 00:31:30.207
he ruined my life.

00:31:30.367 --> 00:31:32.278
He made Phrae file for divorce from me.

00:31:44.554 --> 00:31:45.463
Hello, Jo.

00:31:45.736 --> 00:31:46.551
I need your help with something.

00:31:54.939 --> 00:31:56.468
Are you trying to use this to threaten me?

00:31:56.619 --> 00:31:57.980
Consider this a warning.

00:31:58.826 --> 00:32:01.659
I hope you know what you should do.

00:32:08.191 --> 00:32:10.202
I’ll make you realize how wrong you are.

00:32:10.921 --> 00:32:12.536
You brat.

00:32:19.521 --> 00:32:22.357
Oh, P’Fah, what are you doing here so early?

00:32:22.758 --> 00:32:23.642
Where’s Jo?

00:32:24.068 --> 00:32:25.155
P’Jo isn’t awake yet.

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:28.662
Are you heading to class now?

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:31.868
Yes, I have to go to class now, P’Fah. I’m off.

00:32:38.714 --> 00:32:39.360
Jo.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.333
- Jo.
- North?

00:32:44.028 --> 00:32:47.388
- It’s me.
- Why are you calling yourself “me” with me?

00:32:47.967 --> 00:32:48.874
It’s me.

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:52.340
Hey, how did you get here?

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:54.863
Where did North go?

00:32:55.325 --> 00:32:58.075
North already went to class. He just opened the door for me.

00:32:58.982 --> 00:33:02.228
Why didn’t you wake me up properly? If I accidentally carry you to the bed?

00:33:02.373 --> 00:33:04.014
It’d be too awkward to even look at each other.

00:33:04.194 --> 00:33:06.149
Good thing it’s me and not Arthit.

00:33:06.545 --> 00:33:09.354
Yeah, he’d totally want to be my wife even more.

00:33:09.625 --> 00:33:10.442
Come on, get up.

00:33:14.397 --> 00:33:15.760
What’s up with you?

00:33:18.983 --> 00:33:20.708
So how did it go? Did you talk to him?

00:33:21.256 --> 00:33:22.317
I just warned him.

00:33:24.367 --> 00:33:25.768
Did it work?

00:33:26.303 --> 00:33:27.007
I don’t know.

00:33:28.188 --> 00:33:29.400
Have you talked to him yet?

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:31.373
If Phoon doesn’t want us involved,

00:33:32.567 --> 00:33:33.617
then we’re really meddling.

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:34.610
And

00:33:34.868 --> 00:33:36.429
if in the end Phoon chooses his father,

00:33:37.619 --> 00:33:38.829
and breaks up with you, what will you do?

00:33:41.411 --> 00:33:43.625
Hey, I’m just saying hypothetically.

00:33:44.565 --> 00:33:46.167
What you did might actually work.

00:33:49.527 --> 00:33:50.468
Oh, by the way—

00:33:51.371 --> 00:33:52.986
how’s the thing you asked me to look into?

00:33:53.434 --> 00:33:56.109
Relax. I already sent someone to check it out.

00:33:57.308 --> 00:33:58.466
No progress at all?

00:33:59.059 --> 00:34:01.100
They’re still gathering information.

00:34:01.776 --> 00:34:02.234
But—

00:34:03.232 --> 00:34:04.776
what you said was

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:06.964
Phoon’s mother is probably Japanese, right?

00:34:07.562 --> 00:34:08.080
Yeah.

00:34:09.595 --> 00:34:10.629
Phoon is probably right.

00:34:28.691 --> 00:34:29.671
You’re back already?

00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:31.680
I’m back.

00:34:32.306 --> 00:34:33.377
What are you doing?

00:34:34.386 --> 00:34:36.797
I’m trying to write some Japanese.

00:34:37.404 --> 00:34:38.711
Japanese?

00:34:39.509 --> 00:34:41.533
Just in case I get to talk to my mom.

00:34:41.955 --> 00:34:46.214
Oh, you’re amazing. P’Fah has a reward for a good kid.

00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:47.031
Hm?

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:53.253
Phoon, do you remember telling me to ask Jo to look into your mom?

00:34:54.937 --> 00:34:57.254
Right now, it seems your mom really is in Japan.

00:34:57.872 --> 00:35:01.068
But we still haven’t found her yet. They’re continuing the search.

00:35:02.122 --> 00:35:03.801
- Really?
- Really.

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:05.884
Thank you, P’Fah.

00:35:32.114 --> 00:35:32.854
Phoon.

00:35:34.691 --> 00:35:35.979
Actually…

00:35:36.542 --> 00:35:38.601
today I met your father.

00:35:39.602 --> 00:35:41.097
Your dad called last night.

00:35:47.687 --> 00:35:49.675
I’m sorry I didn’t tell you beforehand, Phoon.

00:35:50.518 --> 00:35:51.568
I just thought that

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:54.173
you didn’t really want to talk about your dad.

00:35:54.527 --> 00:35:56.500
So I didn’t dare to ask you properly.

00:35:57.262 --> 00:35:58.838
I’m worried about you, Phoon.

00:36:00.588 --> 00:36:01.871
It’s not like that.

00:36:02.597 --> 00:36:03.906
I just…

00:36:04.611 --> 00:36:07.703
don’t know how to start telling you about it.

00:36:08.808 --> 00:36:10.917
I haven’t contacted my dad for a long time.

00:36:12.066 --> 00:36:13.472
I think…

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.160
it’s probably better to cut ties like this.

00:36:17.414 --> 00:36:19.494
The time you distanced yourself from me…

00:36:21.127 --> 00:36:22.557
was it because of your dad?

00:36:31.374 --> 00:36:32.448
If…

00:36:32.714 --> 00:36:34.773
your dad asked you to stop seeing me again,

00:36:35.724 --> 00:36:37.053
would you agree to it?

00:36:37.868 --> 00:36:39.149
Did my dad say that?

00:36:39.789 --> 00:36:40.731
No.

00:36:41.217 --> 00:36:42.640
I was just asking, just in case.

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:45.040
Actually…

00:36:45.699 --> 00:36:47.659
my dad didn’t want me involved with you from the start.

00:36:48.247 --> 00:36:50.068
But if he asks me to stop now…

00:36:53.771 --> 00:36:54.866
I won’t do it.

00:37:00.868 --> 00:37:02.237
That’s more than enough

00:37:02.266 --> 00:37:03.171
for me, Phoon.

00:37:04.085 --> 00:37:05.822
You don’t have to worry about anything anymore.

00:37:06.511 --> 00:37:08.097
Everything will be sorted out.

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:10.880
Trust me, little one.

00:37:27.566 --> 00:37:30.493
In the end, Phoon chose me.

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:34.066
Chose what?

00:37:35.753 --> 00:37:38.000
He said he wouldn’t break up with me.

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:40.900
What?

00:37:48.909 --> 00:37:52.139
I’m sorry. I haven’t really had much time for you lately.

00:37:52.429 --> 00:37:53.737
You’re overthinking again, P'Fah.

00:37:54.296 --> 00:37:55.048
It’s okay.

00:37:55.311 --> 00:37:57.360
I’ll let Ter and North to come.

00:37:57.845 --> 00:37:59.115
You should focus on studying too.

00:37:59.514 --> 00:38:00.654
I’ll read and wait for you.

00:38:01.087 --> 00:38:01.758
Okay.

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:03.527
Call me if anything comes up.

00:38:17.626 --> 00:38:21.260
I’m at the café in front of the campus. Hurry over after class. I’m lonely.

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:24.746
I’m lonely too. You ditched me.

00:38:25.033 --> 00:38:27.646
You’re still sulking?

00:38:28.786 --> 00:38:33.246
Go study properly. Read your books, you dropout kid.

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:35.506
I’ve still got a long way to go.

00:38:37.413 --> 00:38:39.753
Study hard, Dao.

00:38:40.026 --> 00:38:41.720
Miss you, Maew.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.966
I’m almost done. You have to treat me a green tea frappe.

00:38:46.486 --> 00:38:47.706
Alright.

00:39:03.875 --> 00:39:05.139
Yes, Aunt Phrae.

00:39:05.533 --> 00:39:09.526
He even threatened me, saying he’d take Fai to live with him.

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:14.873
I’m sorry for dumping all this on you.
I don’t have anyone else to listen to me.

00:39:15.718 --> 00:39:19.050
Other than listening, there’s not much I can do.

00:39:19.486 --> 00:39:22.666
Don’t say that. You’ve helped me so much already.

00:39:23.494 --> 00:39:26.177
I’ll try talking to my partner.

00:39:26.622 --> 00:39:28.000
Maybe he can help somehow.

00:39:28.086 --> 00:39:34.166
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Just having you listen already means a lot.

00:39:35.063 --> 00:39:38.011
I want to help. Fai is my younger sibling.

00:39:50.817 --> 00:39:54.017
What did you tell Tonfah for him to treat me like this?

00:39:54.265 --> 00:39:55.100
Treat you how?

00:39:55.367 --> 00:39:58.514
How? You ungrateful bastard.

00:39:58.856 --> 00:40:01.474
This whole thing with Phrae is because of you, isn’t it?

00:40:01.648 --> 00:40:04.724
You already took Thorfun. Still not satisfied?

00:40:04.921 --> 00:40:08.091
What you’re doing is making me lose my wife and kids.

00:40:08.604 --> 00:40:11.546
You bastard. How far are you going to ruin my life?

00:40:12.183 --> 00:40:14.466
I never should’ve let that woman give birth to you.

00:40:14.873 --> 00:40:16.373
Then why did you let me be born?

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:19.350
If you never loved me or cared at all.

00:40:19.726 --> 00:40:21.070
Did I ask to be born?

00:40:24.271 --> 00:40:25.503
If I could choose…

00:40:26.013 --> 00:40:28.059
do you think I’d choose you as my father?

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.619
I can’t choose that.

00:40:30.962 --> 00:40:32.668
You’re the one who had the choice.

00:40:33.471 --> 00:40:36.228
I’m the result of your actions.

00:40:36.533 --> 00:40:37.937
Take some responsibility.

00:40:38.151 --> 00:40:40.477
I told that woman to get rid of you.

00:40:40.911 --> 00:40:42.434
I never chose you.

00:40:42.811 --> 00:40:45.037
I never wanted you to be born.

00:40:45.826 --> 00:40:46.835
That woman…

00:40:47.071 --> 00:40:48.807
she was stupid and stubborn.

00:40:49.297 --> 00:40:50.656
She chose to keep you.

00:40:50.965 --> 00:40:52.737
And in the end, she abandoned you anyway.

00:40:53.023 --> 00:40:55.241
No one even knows where she is now.

00:40:55.755 --> 00:40:58.241
And you think Aunt Phrae left you because of me?

00:40:59.097 --> 00:41:00.463
She wanted to raise Fai on her own.

00:41:01.294 --> 00:41:03.554
Because you’re too messed up to be a father.

00:41:03.903 --> 00:41:06.762
So messed up she didn’t even want you touching her daughter.

00:41:07.031 --> 00:41:08.071
Big mouth.

00:41:08.626 --> 00:41:10.106
You’re asking for it.

00:41:10.611 --> 00:41:11.678
Hey, North!

00:41:12.669 --> 00:41:15.422
- North, that’s enough.
- This bastard deserves it!

00:41:16.641 --> 00:41:18.025
That’s enough!

00:41:18.465 --> 00:41:20.020
You little shit just punched me!

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:21.648
I’ll remember this.

00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:23.345
Keep an eye on your friend.

00:41:23.628 --> 00:41:28.506
- Serves you right, asshole! Who the hell are you?
- Calm down, North.

00:41:29.453 --> 00:41:31.037
Huh? Your dad?

00:41:31.361 --> 00:41:33.327
That guy earlier was your dad?

00:41:33.622 --> 00:41:34.314
Yeah.

00:41:34.718 --> 00:41:37.220
I saw him about to hit you, so I hit him first.

00:41:38.303 --> 00:41:41.770
Damn it, I’ve never punched a friend’s dad in my life.

00:41:42.674 --> 00:41:45.330
It’s fine. You were just trying to help me.

00:41:45.924 --> 00:41:48.925
What kind of father beats his kid like he’s trying to kill him?

00:41:51.231 --> 00:41:53.734
- Does it hurt?
- Hell yes, it does.

00:41:53.921 --> 00:41:54.668
Sorry.

00:41:56.518 --> 00:41:58.202
What am I gonna tell P'Jo?

00:41:59.845 --> 00:42:01.482
Say I’m allergic to chili?

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:03.574
Think he’ll believe it?

00:42:04.051 --> 00:42:05.920
Or maybe I drank some wine,

00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:07.103
and got a little dizzy.

00:42:08.041 --> 00:42:08.850
Ow.

00:42:10.026 --> 00:42:11.471
Will P'Jo believe me?

00:42:14.308 --> 00:42:14.930
Hey.

00:42:17.244 --> 00:42:17.882
North.

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:19.592
They said you got beaten up?

00:42:19.681 --> 00:42:20.755
Are you okay?

00:42:35.226 --> 00:42:35.998
Does it hurt?

00:42:39.641 --> 00:42:40.392
Fah.

00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:41.684
Come talk to me for a second.

00:42:43.192 --> 00:42:43.637
Okay.

00:42:44.863 --> 00:42:46.675
Hill, stay with them for now.

00:42:59.451 --> 00:43:01.121
I really thought talking nicely would get through to him.

00:43:01.638 --> 00:43:03.442
If you don’t do anything, I’ll handle it myself.

00:43:03.773 --> 00:43:04.405
Calm down first.

00:43:04.765 --> 00:43:06.154
How the hell am I supposed to calm down?

00:43:06.865 --> 00:43:08.198
Then calm down for me, at least.

00:43:11.025 --> 00:43:12.564
I’ve got to do something about this.

00:43:15.034 --> 00:43:16.752
What do you mean, the account’s been frozen?

00:43:17.395 --> 00:43:19.665
Are you crazy? How is that even possible? Did you check properly?

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.034
Turn yourself in, Rit.

00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:24.240
What did you say? How dare you talk to me like that?

00:43:26.995 --> 00:43:27.848
Tonfah.

00:43:29.001 --> 00:43:30.091
But how could he do this?

00:43:30.191 --> 00:43:32.371
I already cleaned everything up.

00:43:35.278 --> 00:43:36.388
Captain, Sergeant.

00:43:36.982 --> 00:43:38.554
What are you arresting me for, officer?

00:43:38.915 --> 00:43:42.508
Officer, wait—let go first. Let’s sit down and talk.

00:43:42.588 --> 00:43:43.737
You can’t just arrest me like this.

00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:50.680
It has sent shockwaves through the business world.
A prominent businessman and former senior executive of a leading real estate company

00:43:50.753 --> 00:43:54.093
was arrested by police in his hotel room while preparing to flee.

00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:57.760
He is now a suspect in embezzlement and money laundering cases.

00:43:57.909 --> 00:43:59.960
Was that you and P'Jo doing?

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:09.622
At first, I thought he wouldn’t bother you anymore.

00:44:13.284 --> 00:44:14.659
But then he did this.

00:44:18.358 --> 00:44:19.324
Honestly,

00:44:19.619 --> 00:44:21.613
I’ve been worried about your dad for a while now.

00:44:22.496 --> 00:44:24.487
So I asked Jo to look into it a bit.

00:44:25.182 --> 00:44:27.831
That’s how we found evidence of embezzlement and money laundering.

00:44:28.724 --> 00:44:29.496
At first,

00:44:30.234 --> 00:44:32.525
I only meant to use it to scare him into leaving you alone.

00:44:33.385 --> 00:44:35.128
But since he chose to do this,

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.121
I had to do the right thing.

00:44:41.623 --> 00:44:42.897
Are you mad at me, Phoon?

00:44:45.878 --> 00:44:47.411
Why would I be mad at you?

00:44:49.954 --> 00:44:52.151
That’s exactly what he deserved.

00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:54.760
Mr. Ritchai admitted to authorities

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:57.840
that he was involved in illegal money transfers,

00:44:58.446 --> 00:45:04.100
including businesses under his management that may be linked to gray-area operations in neighboring countries.

00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:08.426
Authorities are currently reviewing financial records spanning several years.

00:45:08.646 --> 00:45:09.780
Back then,

00:45:10.484 --> 00:45:12.808
he was so proud of his image.

00:45:13.179 --> 00:45:16.675
Now he has to hide even his face.

00:45:18.136 --> 00:45:19.601
I cared about him so much,

00:45:20.714 --> 00:45:22.717
did everything he wanted me to be,

00:45:24.017 --> 00:45:25.736
hoping he’d love me back.

00:45:27.717 --> 00:45:28.626
But he never did.

00:45:30.909 --> 00:45:31.964
In the end,

00:45:32.765 --> 00:45:33.979
I was left all alone.

00:45:38.388 --> 00:45:39.703
Why would you say that?

00:45:40.411 --> 00:45:41.494
You’ve got me.

00:45:42.534 --> 00:45:43.826
You still have me.

00:45:44.468 --> 00:45:46.900
Don’t think you have to be alone anymore.

00:45:47.591 --> 00:45:49.155
Or I’ll get sad, you know.

00:45:51.906 --> 00:45:52.859
I’m sorry.

00:45:54.517 --> 00:45:55.733
You will always have me.

00:46:25.902 --> 00:46:26.645
Where did you go?

00:46:27.228 --> 00:46:28.554
I went to grab something downstairs.

00:46:29.219 --> 00:46:30.388
Jo sent it over.

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:33.680
Good news.

00:46:36.682 --> 00:46:37.360
What is it?

00:46:55.748 --> 00:46:56.565
Mom.

00:47:13.035 --> 00:47:13.948
P'Fah.

00:47:15.115 --> 00:47:15.645
Yeah?

00:47:16.149 --> 00:47:17.842
Mom must’ve had me when she wasn’t ready at all.

00:47:18.588 --> 00:47:19.733
Are you going to see her?

00:47:20.374 --> 00:47:23.120
I think you should. She must miss you a lot.

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:27.040
Maybe she doesn’t want to see me.

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:29.457
That’s why she never replied to my letters.

00:47:30.232 --> 00:47:31.496
Why do you think that?

00:47:32.179 --> 00:47:34.884
Maybe I’m just not used to being happy.

00:47:36.397 --> 00:47:39.450
I’m really sorry.

00:47:39.731 --> 00:47:41.884
Mom loves you.
