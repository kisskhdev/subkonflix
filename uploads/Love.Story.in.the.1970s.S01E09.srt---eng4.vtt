=Love Story in the 1970s=

=Episode 9=

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.130
Don't just stare at me.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.220
We're on the same side here.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:57.460
Are we?

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:02.626
(Fei Family Tai Chi Manual)

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.020
You were bought off

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.940
a long time ago.

00:02:07.648 --> 00:02:08.650
And all this stuff, too.

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:09.520
What are they for?

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.810
Trying to buy me off?

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.410
Our family may not be well-off,

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.340
but I'm not that shallow.

00:02:14.404 --> 00:02:15.590
I'm not selling my daughter.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.650
Mom, please don't be mad.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.410
I asked him to buy these.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.650
It's not his fault.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.060
Mrs. Fei,

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.810
I've been thinking

00:02:24.026 --> 00:02:25.130
about why you won't agree

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.460
to let Fei Ni marry me.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.740
I'm not as qualified as Ye Feng,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.600
but a marriage is more than

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.220
just about material life.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.650
We should be spiritually in sync.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.310
And in that regard,

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.570
no one can compare to me.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.370
Don't give me that flowery talk.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.340
I don't understand it.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.210
All I know is,

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.060
my daughter

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.690
will not trade her future

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.530
for one unit.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.940
Ni, be honest with me.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.970
Are you in such a rush
to marry Fang Muyang

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.650
because Jiangcheng No. 1 Textile Factory

00:02:56.804 --> 00:02:58.410
promised to allocate him
a unit?

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.540
How can you say that about Ni?

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.970
She's not that kind of person.

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:03.810
I am.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.020
I'm marrying Fang Muyang
for the unit.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.940
But...

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:11.810
You're doing this,

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.370
so your brother and Lin Mei
can get married sooner.

00:03:14.915 --> 00:03:16.640
You want to free up a place for them,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.800
don't you?

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:23.530
No.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:35.740
Not entirely.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.540
If I hadn't asked Lin Mei,

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.340
I wouldn't have known
you were marrying him for a unit.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.310
Ni,

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.710
I know you
and your brother are close.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.650
I know you care about him.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.530
But you can't

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.740
throw your whole life away for him.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.420
I won't agree to this.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.650
Not in a million years.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.780
Mom.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.880
I am not

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.020
doing this just for my brother.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.970
I have my own reasons.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.340
If it were only about

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.570
making room for him,

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.260
I could marry Ye Feng.

00:04:20.404 --> 00:04:22.250
I just don't want to live feeling small.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.626
That's why I chose Fang Muyang.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.450
Ye Feng is a good man,

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.250
but we're not suited for each other.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.250
I don't want to spend my life

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.620
always feeling inferior

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.060
around his family.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.370
I know about that.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.620
Ye Feng doesn't
want Ni to go to college.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.250
Fine, even if it's not Ye Feng,

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.940
can't you find someone
with similar prospects?

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.060
Fang Muyang is...

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.710
All things aside,

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.710
other than that "hero" title of his,

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:02.810
what does he really have?

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.010
No matter how rich a man is,

00:05:05.182 --> 00:05:06.270
it still belongs to them,

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.330
not me.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.660
They can take it back anytime.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.500
And honestly,

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.130
I think Fang Muyang is the right one.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.920
He's no worse than anyone else.

00:05:16.715 --> 00:05:18.540
When he was sent down
to the countryside,

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.250
he was recommended for college.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:21.680
He didn't hesitate

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.860
to save a life.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.760
Why shouldn't

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.740
I marry a man like that?

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.250
The girl

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:41.550
makes a good point.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.550
All dressed up today?

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:59.370
What's the occasion?

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.540
We're registering our marriage.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.093
I'll bring you wedding candies later.

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.860
I understand.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.810
Thank you.

00:06:18.804 --> 00:06:19.760
What did they say?

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.400
The hospital said

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.260
Fang Muyang

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.010
left early this morning all dressed up.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.920
Did you tell him we're waiting
here to go to the subdistrict office

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.560
(Modesty helps one improve)
to register?

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.271
(Pride makes one fall behind)
I told him.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:34.110
See?

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:36.130
We've been waiting for over an hour.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.540
I told you Fang Muyang isn't
someone you should marry.

00:06:38.604 --> 00:06:40.450
There's no telling
what's going on in his head.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.250
He seems perfectly fine,

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.450
but when it really matters,

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.740
who knows when he might lose it.

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:47.520
If you ask me,

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.460
maybe he had an episode
and wandered off.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:50.840
Let's go home.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.030
Let's wait a little longer.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.370
Wait for what?

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:55.540
If Fang Muyang

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.060
doesn't explain himself today,

00:06:57.093 --> 00:06:58.493
you are not to see him again.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.460
And you,

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.280
making your mother upset in this heat.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:08.830
Well...

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.780
Fei Ni, marriage is a serious matter.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:22.880
You need to think it through.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:24.980
If it doesn't feel right,

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.180
it's not too late to stop.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.980
There's no need to rush this.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.130
Your brother wouldn't agree otherwise.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.740
Maybe we should head back first.

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:38.810
Your parents could be upset.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:40.770
Lin Mei.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:46.920
You're hiding something.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:48.450
I'm not.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:52.860
My brother is back?

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.540
I didn't know.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:57.380
Did you

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:58.890
tell him that Fang Muyang and I

00:07:58.890 --> 00:07:59.740
are getting married?

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.420
I didn't.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:02.860
Did my brother go to see him?

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:03.620
Tell me.

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:07.770
He said

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.210
he went to talk to Fang Muyang.

00:08:13.893 --> 00:08:16.560
Heilongjiang Production
and Construction Corps, 29th Regiment,

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.626
Agriculture Unit 2, Squad 3,
educated youth Fei Ting

00:08:18.693 --> 00:08:20.940
salutes Comrade Fang Muyang,
hero of lifesaving.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:22.830
Brother-in-law.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.740
How do I shake your hand if I'm tied up?

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:28.980
Comrade Fang Muyang,

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.950
since you're indisposed,
no need for formalities.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.140
At least untie me first.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:32.720
Stop.

00:08:33.204 --> 00:08:33.900
Hold your horses.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:35.380
Who's your brother-in-law?

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:36.300
Fine.

00:08:36.826 --> 00:08:38.660
I'll call you what Fei Ni calls you.
Brother.

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:39.410
Totally not!

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:43.440
Brother.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:44.610
Brother!

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.330
No, no. Comrade Fei Ting.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:47.020
Comrade Fei Ting.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:48.050
This is between us.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:48.670
This is totally

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:49.210
unnecessary.

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:50.120
I'm asking you now.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.360
Answer honestly.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:52.140
All right.

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:54.260
Are you really stupid
or just pretending?

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:55.180
I'm really stupid.

00:08:55.271 --> 00:08:56.730
Then you shouldn't marry my sister.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.020
She can't marry a fool.

00:08:58.582 --> 00:08:59.760
Then I'm not stupid.

00:08:59.782 --> 00:09:01.060
That's even worse.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:02.260
That makes you a liar.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.130
Brother.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:04.780
Fei Ting.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:06.260
What are you doing?

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.730
Fei Ting, didn't you say

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:08.970
you just wanted to talk?

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:10.140
Why are you holding a knife?

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.420
I'm just trying to scare him.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:13.530
Why are you all here?

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.848
I told you not to say anything.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:15.920
This is between you two.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:16.850
Work it out yourselves.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.260
Either way, I'm the bad guy.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.020
Why did you tie him up?

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.520
Ni, are you really
going to marry a fool?

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:24.670
He's not a fool.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:25.750
He's a hero.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.520
Even if he is,
he's not marrying my sister.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.620
I know you're doing this
for Lin Mei and me.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.850
I told you, it's not because of you.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:33.380
Why won't you believe me?

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:49.870
Brother.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:52.880
I know you're worried about me.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:54.260
But you know me.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.210
I'm very practical.

00:09:56.448 --> 00:09:58.260
If this were about
freeing up a room for you,

00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.850
why would I marry him?

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:01.570
I could find someone
with better prospects.

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.730
That's what I told him too.

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:05.850
But he wouldn't believe me.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.140
He insisted on coming back.

00:10:09.293 --> 00:10:10.730
But he's not right in the head.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:12.060
His heart is pure.

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:14.260
That makes him better than many men.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.060
Brother,

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.570
ask Lin Mei.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:21.420
Does she like you

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:24.570
because of your prospects?

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.660
If you ever treat Ni badly,

00:10:50.648 --> 00:10:52.380
I'll tie you up
and throw you in the river.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:54.850
Don't worry.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.610
I never would.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:06.540
Lin Mei...

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:10.660
Let's go register the marriage.

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:13.660
Wait at home for us.

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:15.020
Come on, let's go.

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:26.300
(People's Photo Studio)

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:29.210
All right, you two.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:30.720
Stand a little closer.

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.450
Miss, move toward the center.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:34.770
That's it.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:36.850
A bit closer to your husband.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:40.170
Good. Relax.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.150
Sir, loosen up a little.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.540
That's right.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.390
You're newlyweds. Look happy.

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:46.950
Miss, smile.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:48.620
Smile.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:49.810
Good, good.

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:51.970
Sir, give me a smile too.

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.210
Three, two, one.

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:58.260
(Wedding Commemoration 1975)

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.260
Today is a joyous day.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.660
From now on, we're one family.

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:06.780
I only have one request.

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:09.850
Treat Ni well for the rest of your life.

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:11.330
Yes, yes.

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:14.980
I wish you both
a prosperous life together

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:16.190
and lasting happiness.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.880
Thank you, Dad.
Thank you, Mom.

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:19.780
Don't worry.

00:12:19.915 --> 00:12:21.420
From now on,
I only listen to Fei Ni.

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:27.420
Fei Ni.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:29.060
I...

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:34.570
I don't even know what to say.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:36.940
We don't need to say anything.

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:41.060
I wish you happiness.

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:43.940
I wish us happiness.

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.850
Yes, yes.
Wishing you both happiness.

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:46.540
All right.

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.490
Come on, let's eat.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:51.330
Brother.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:54.060
Fang Muyang and I
have talked it over.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:56.060
Once the unit is assigned,
we'll move out.

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.020
You and Lin Mei should hurry, too.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.850
We're not in a rush.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.380
You're not, but I am.

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.660
No, I am. I'm in a rush.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:06.420
How could I not be?

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.690
- Good. You should be.
- I am.

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:10.060
Let's make it happen fast.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:14.780
Cheers!

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.160
Cheers!

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:21.660
Dig in.

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:23.420
Come on, dig in. Eat.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:24.660
It's a wonderful day.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.090
Let me perform something.

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:27.570
All right.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.090
The moment I see the princess
steal the command arrow,

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:31.940
my heart fills with joy.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:37.810
I stand at the palace gates
and call for the guards.

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:43.660
Fang,

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:45.610
you can even fix electronics?

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:47.810
Mom, I learned a bit before.

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:50.060
Impressive.

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:51.020
Have some water.

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:54.180
It's getting late.

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:55.260
Fei Ting,

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:56.500
stop busying yourself.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:57.460
Take Lin Mei home.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:58.180
It's late.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:58.970
Okay, Mom.

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.760
Lin Mei, stop working.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:01.570
I've got it.

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:02.960
Head back. It's too late.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.440
Don't make your parents worry.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:05.130
Come here.

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:05.940
Here, here.

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:10.720
Brother, don't just leave her
at the building entrance.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.380
Say hello to her parents.

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:13.210
I know.

00:14:14.271 --> 00:14:15.360
Take it slow on the way.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.382
It's dark. Ride carefully.

00:14:16.382 --> 00:14:17.020
We're heading out.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:17.380
All right.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.060
Don't worry, Mom.

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:19.140
We've got everything.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:19.970
Stay safe.

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:21.210
Here, Ni.

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:24.060
Tonight,

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.660
you and Fang Muyang can
sleep in our bed.

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.420
What about you two?

00:14:28.982 --> 00:14:29.937
We'll be fine.

00:14:29.937 --> 00:14:31.970
Your mom and I will stay
at your second aunt's place.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:33.020
No need, Mom, Dad.

00:14:33.071 --> 00:14:34.420
I got the letter of introduction.

00:14:34.648 --> 00:14:36.610
Fei Ni and I will stay
at the guesthouse tonight.

00:14:37.537 --> 00:14:38.430
Is that all right?

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:40.210
Fang really thought this through.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:44.850
Ni,

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:46.180
come inside with Mom.

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.350
I need to tell you something.

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:48.280
Go have some water.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:49.060
Sit a bit longer.

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:52.030
Listen.

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:54.610
Why does it sound a bit fuzzy?

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:55.420
Let me hear.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:56.700
Here, listen.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:58.810
Ni,

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:01.660
well,

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.570
today is your big day with Fang.

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:10.020
Do you understand the procedures?

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:13.140
What procedures?

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:16.380
We already got
our marriage certificate.

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.180
That's the state's procedure.

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.260
I mean the procedure
between you two.

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:29.380
Well,

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:32.610
as a newlywed couple,

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.450
on your wedding night,

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:36.540
first comes unity,

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:37.850
then comes tension.

00:15:38.448 --> 00:15:39.310
You should follow

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:40.970
a gradual approach,

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:43.810
stay modest and cautious,

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:46.530
and avoid arrogance or impatience.

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:49.850
Mom,

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.060
what are you talking about?

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.600
I'm sharing my experience with you.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:59.180
Fang isn't very worldly.

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:01.850
There are some things
you'll have to guide him through.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:02.850
Ni,

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:03.490
don't be shy.

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:05.260
- Mom!
- You're husband and wife now.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:06.580
Please stop.

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:09.730
This is embarrassing for me too.

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:11.810
If I don't tell you now,

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:14.048
who are you going to ask
once you get to the guesthouse?

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:14.620
Listen.

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:16.420
You need to be mindful of Fang's health.

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:17.920
I've heard that

00:16:18.115 --> 00:16:19.893
if someone has issues with their mind,

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.060
it might affect other areas too.

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:24.660
Mom, I'm leaving.

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:28.090
I made myself clear, right?

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:32.900
(Jiangcheng No. 2 Guesthouse)

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:38.320
So?

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.330
I prepared all this in advance.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:49.380
Why is there

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:51.380
only one bed?

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:46.230
Fang Muyang.

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:54.620
What?

00:17:55.604 --> 00:17:56.804
I'm going to wash up.

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:57.940
Together?

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:04.140
I already washed at home.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:11.530
Wait for me.

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:35.620
Comrade Fang Muyang.

00:18:37.982 --> 00:18:38.960
Please, have a seat.

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:56.100
Given our rather special relationship,

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:58.490
I've drafted a written agreement.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:59.630
Take a look.

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:01.040
If you agree,

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.010
just sign your name.

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:06.420
Marriage Agreement.

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:08.970
(Marriage Agreement)
Comrade Fei Ni and Comrade Fang Muyang

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:10.340
have reached an agreement

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:12.180
on their post-marital life,

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:13.690
based on equality and consent,

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:15.730
after friendly consultation,

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:17.620
and both parties shall abide by it.

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.340
The two parties shall be
husband and wife in name only.

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:37.100
They shall neither enjoy

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:40.490
nor fulfill any obligations
of a real marital relationship.

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.580
(Fang Muyang)

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.420
You'd better keep that safe.

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:15.420
Of course.

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:17.250
I'll guard this carefully.

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:23.690
Fei Ni,

00:20:25.715 --> 00:20:27.404
there's something I want to tell you.

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:30.420
My memory has come back.

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:33.620
Your memory is back?

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:36.190
When did that happen?

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:37.671
Why are you only telling me now?

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.210
I didn't tell you because

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:40.770
you once said
that once I got better,

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:43.420
you wouldn't look after me anymore.

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:48.140
But now we're married.

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:50.580
So I'm not afraid anymore.

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:56.160
Fei Ni,

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:00.010
thank you.

00:21:03.315 --> 00:21:05.100
Thank you for letting me
into your family.

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:25.620
This is for self-defense.

00:21:26.471 --> 00:21:27.770
I know you don't trust me yet.

00:21:36.004 --> 00:21:37.690
You take the bed.
I'll sleep on the floor.

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:39.420
The floor's too hard.

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.100
Feeling sorry for me?

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:44.660
Or we could squeeze in together.

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:45.290
No.

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:47.960
Comrade Fang Muyang,
you'll just have to make do.

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.550
All right.

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:09.380
(Jiangcheng No. 2 Guesthouse)

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:10.830
Are you asleep, Fang Muyang?

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:12.070
No.

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:24.770
It feels like I'm dreaming.

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:31.050
When we were kids,
I had bad luck whenever I ran into you.

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.690
But now it's you

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:37.870
who's brought me this good fortune.

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:41.080
I hope that

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:43.560
only good fortune

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:45.940
awaits us from now on.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:51.770
Fang Muyang,

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.620
have you ever thought about

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.690
how we'd set up our home?

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:00.660
No.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.210
I've imagined it so many times.

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:09.140
If this room were our home,

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:10.660
I'd put

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:12.820
a small desk

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:14.100
right over here,

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:16.900
and a big bookshelf beside it.

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:18.900
What about you?

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:22.010
Then I'd put

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:26.290
a square dining table over here,

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:28.770
and then

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.140
a sofa here.

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:33.160
A sofa here?

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:35.760
Wouldn't that take up too much space?

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:38.290
But I like the table.

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:39.010
I really do.

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:43.140
Then, I'd put

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.100
a sewing machine

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:47.100
right here.

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:49.420
I'd add

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:51.210
a chest of drawers,

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:54.380
and two long benches.

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:55.940
Wait, wait.

00:23:57.690 --> 00:24:00.770
At this rate,
the room's going to be packed.

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:07.340
We haven't even placed the bed yet.

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:08.210
That's right.

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:10.420
We didn't plan for the bed.

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:11.940
So where are we sleeping?

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:13.380
We can't hang from the wall.

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:14.900
Then, let's start over.

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:22.290
All right,
we'll begin with two single beds.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.580
If we buy two single beds
right after getting married,

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:28.690
won't people get suspicious?

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:30.140
Then what should we do?

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:38.010
We should get

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:42.180
a double bed that can be taken apart.

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:46.290
During the day,
we put it together as one big bed.

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:48.770
At night,
we split it into two small ones.

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:52.010
That's actually a great idea.

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:57.420
I'll still put
a sewing machine over here,

00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:00.380
and this will still be my little desk.

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.180
I'll give up the bookshelf.

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:06.420
I want to put an easel here.

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:07.140
An easel?

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:08.580
Yes, for painting.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:13.690
When did you get up here?

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:16.180
Just now.

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:19.340
Get down.

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:23.010
Get down.

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:26.620
Hurry up and get down.

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:29.560
All right, it's settled then.

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:31.050
(Jiangcheng)

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:31.940
Please don't push.

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:33.115
Board in an orderly manner.

00:25:33.137 --> 00:25:33.760
Watch your step.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.026
Submit the return-to-city report

00:25:35.026 --> 00:25:35.990
as soon as you get there.

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.770
Got it?

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:37.730
Got it.

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:39.140
You've repeated that a lot.

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:40.820
Now you're getting impatient?

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:42.400
Everyone, stay safe.

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:43.620
I'm telling you,

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:45.820
if you delay it again,

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:48.820
I won't wait for you.

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:50.580
Everyone, hold your children's hands.

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:51.220
Lin Mei.

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:53.900
I was wrong before.

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.380
I shouldn't have
said those things to you.

00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:59.100
I was just afraid of holding you back.

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:04.450
Weren't you afraid I'd get upset

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:05.620
and leave with someone else?

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:06.380
Of course I was.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:08.490
I kept dreaming
you married someone else.

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:09.010
I even...

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:09.940
You even what?

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:12.140
I...

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:15.250
I was so upset
that I plowed a few extra acres.

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:23.010
I knew it.

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:24.915
Nothing good
ever comes out of your mouth.

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:26.650
How did I

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:28.290
ever fall for you?

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:30.730
Guess I'm just lucky.

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:32.210
But don't worry.

00:26:32.293 --> 00:26:34.180
I'll do everything I can
to come back early.

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:36.140
As soon as I'm back, I'll propose.

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:37.420
It's a promise.

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:38.730
Yes.

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:44.490
I'm heading off.

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:46.530
Here, take this.

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:53.820
Go on.

00:26:54.182 --> 00:26:55.115
You should head back.

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:56.660
Take care of yourself.

00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:57.620
Wait for me.

00:26:58.970 --> 00:26:59.380
Go on.

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:01.340
Eat well and get some rest.

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:02.050
Yes.

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:03.580
Stay safe!

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:14.820
(Jiangcheng)

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:21.660
(Jiangcheng No. 1 Textile Factory)

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:23.182
(Marriage Certificate)
All right.

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:24.490
Wonderful!

00:27:24.737 --> 00:27:27.250
On behalf of Jiangcheng
No. 1 Textile Factory, congratulations!

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:30.180
May you learn from each other

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:31.420
and make progress together.

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:33.380
Thank you, Ms. Xu.

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:34.180
You're welcome.

00:27:34.582 --> 00:27:36.290
If there's nothing else, you may go.

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:47.970
Ms. Xu,

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:51.730
you didn't assign me housing before

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:52.970
because I was single

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:54.940
and married employees had priority.

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:55.970
But as you can see,

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:58.490
I'm married now.

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:00.420
Fei Ni is also a factory employee.

00:28:00.582 --> 00:28:02.493
We qualify for housing now, don't we?

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:06.210
I did say that.

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:08.180
As a cadre,

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:10.210
I stand by my word.

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:12.420
But in this round of allocations,

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:14.420
there aren't many new dorm units.

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.380
Most are vacant older ones

00:28:17.426 --> 00:28:18.420
with average conditions.

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:20.900
When the next batch
of new units is completed,

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:23.770
I'll assign you a new place.

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:24.770
No need, Ms. Xu.

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:26.290
We're not picky.

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:28.260
You told me to show some consideration.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.250
We can give up

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:30.940
the next batch to others.

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:32.530
We'll take an older unit.

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:33.390
That's right.

00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:34.690
Comrade Fang Muyang.

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:37.770
- Please understand our difficulties.
- Ms. Xu,

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:40.090
we've already been very understanding.

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:41.600
Fei Ni and I even

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.480
had to spend
our wedding night in a guesthouse.

00:28:47.226 --> 00:28:47.900
How about this?

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:50.620
We'll live in the guesthouse.

00:28:51.271 --> 00:28:52.770
Will the factory reimburse the cost?

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:54.820
Are you joking?

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:56.040
On what grounds

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.010
should the factory cover that expense?

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:00.580
Ms. Xu,

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:02.530
I heard that

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:04.290
on this round of housing allocations,

00:29:05.004 --> 00:29:06.100
Feng Lin is on the list.

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:11.180
The housing list was decided

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:14.010
collectively by the leadership.

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:15.940
Any objections?

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:18.770
If I remember correctly,

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:21.340
you said housing should prioritize

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:22.620
employees with families.

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:24.380
But Feng Lin is single.

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:26.770
Why does she qualify
for a unit?

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:28.580
Feng Lin is a university graduate.

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:30.070
She's a key talent

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:32.180
that we are cultivating.

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:33.820
Of course, she qualifies.

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:35.182
I wanted to go to college, too.

00:29:35.226 --> 00:29:36.410
You refused to recommend me.

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:38.180
Fei Ni,

00:29:38.604 --> 00:29:40.400
marrying a hero doesn't
give you the right

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.730
to speak to me like this.

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:43.680
But I'm stating facts.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.770
The fact is,

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:46.560
no matter who you are

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:48.210
or what contributions you've made,

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:50.140
you cannot cause trouble
for the organization!

00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:51.490
Fang Muyang is a hero.

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:52.940
- And we're married now.
- Fei Ni.

00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:54.730
Enough.

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:03.790
Ms. Xu, sorry to trouble you.

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:05.970
Let's go.

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:19.100
You shouldn't have stopped me just now.

00:30:19.271 --> 00:30:20.960
You saw the way Xu Hongqi was acting.

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:22.820
Arguing with her was pointless.

00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:25.710
But we can't just let it go.

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:27.470
We're already married.

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:29.190
Why can't we be assigned a place?

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.420
Where are you going?

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:33.970
To see the Party secretary.

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:35.580
There must be a way to argue our case.

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:37.380
Xu Hongqi is the director.

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:39.250
A complaint against her

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:40.620
won't end well for you.

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:42.640
What if you lose your job?

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:55.080
Fei Ni.

00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:20.010
Fang Muyang.

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:22.300
I feel like

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:25.900
no matter how hard I try,

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:28.620
I can't live the life I want.

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:40.180
Whether it's going to college

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:42.490
or getting assigned housing,

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.580
maybe I shouldn't
even hope for those things.

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:07.770
Don't rush.

00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:10.340
I'll find a way

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:12.970
to get your unit back.

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:16.680
What way?

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:18.180
Trust me.

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:22.140
But right now,

00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:24.490
there's a more pressing matter.

00:32:26.337 --> 00:32:27.100
Come with me.

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:33.640
Coming.

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:34.770
Coming.

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:36.420
What a feast today.

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:37.420
Of course.

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:41.180
Today marks
the 30th wedding anniversary

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:43.620
of Comrade Wu Baoying
and Comrade Fei Mingde.

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:45.770
We had to make it special.

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:48.380
Honey...

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:54.900
Thank you for taking care
of me for all these 30 years.

00:32:55.382 --> 00:32:57.115
From the bottom of my heart, thank you

00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:00.340
for giving me such wonderful children
over these past years.

00:33:01.248 --> 00:33:02.380
You've worked so hard.

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:04.690
You too.

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:10.010
Mom, Dad, we're back.

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:17.448
Have some.

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:21.580
You can stay here as long as you like.

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:23.730
Why did you go and buy new shoes?

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:25.290
Mom,

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:27.140
it's a small gesture
from Fang Muyang.

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.790
Exactly.
It's from the young man's heart.

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:33.100
Come on, eat.

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:34.660
Mom,

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:37.100
as long as the factory
hasn't finalized the list,

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:38.340
we still have hope.

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:40.880
This is your home.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:41.940
What are you saying?

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:42.940
You can move back in,

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:44.848
so your dad and I won't miss you
so badly.

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:45.690
Exactly.

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:51.050
What about Lin Mei and my brother?

00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:52.730
Don't worry about your brother.

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:54.420
You've done all you can.

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:56.450
He's a grown man.

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:57.970
If he can't find a wife,

00:33:57.970 --> 00:33:59.210
that's on him.

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:03.770
This is all Xu Hongqi's fault.

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:06.420
How can she go back on her word?

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:11.170
Don't make it worse.

00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:12.260
Ni,

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.010
you and Fang shouldn't
get too worked up.

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:15.780
Xu Hongqi is still a leader,

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:16.340
after all.

00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:18.160
If anything comes up,

00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:20.040
don't confront her head-on.

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:22.220
Let's take it one step at a time.

00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:24.530
Tonight, you two just get some rest.

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:27.450
You're newlyweds.

00:34:27.450 --> 00:34:28.330
Stay happy.

00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:31.900
Your mom's right.

00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:34.400
Don't worry.

00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:36.610
They may have cannons,

00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:38.530
but we've got millet and rifles.

00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:40.650
We'll fight with guerrilla tactics
and street battles.

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:42.380
Victory shall be ours eventually.

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:43.780
Right?

00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:46.530
Trust me.

00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:51.130
Wrap up what's left.

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:54.530
We can't waste food.

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:56.780
Let's carry on our fine traditions.

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.170
Finish it all properly.

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:02.440
Feel this.

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:04.610
It's all freshly stuffed cotton.

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:08.420
Look at
the double-happiness character.

00:35:08.970 --> 00:35:11.740
I searched for a long time
for this fabric.

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:14.420
Do you like it?

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:15.700
I do.

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:18.610
Settle in and stay here.

00:35:18.737 --> 00:35:20.715
Stop worrying
about your brother and Lin Mei.

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:24.820
Get some rest.

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:26.300
Come on, Fang.

00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:27.293
- Get in here.
- Mom.

00:35:27.337 --> 00:35:28.226
Don't just stand there.

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:29.700
The bed's a bit small,

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:30.610
but you two can rest.

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:32.300
I'll go help your dad clean up.

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:35.220
Mom's right.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:36.300
The bed is a bit small.

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:37.970
Why don't we squeeze in?

00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:38.900
In your dreams.

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:40.160
You're sleeping on the floor.

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:42.820
Then I'll

00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:43.970
lie down for a bit first.

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:09.220
Honey,

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:12.610
I wanted to have a proper
celebration with you,

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:13.780
but it didn't work out.

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:15.090
I'll make it up to you next year.

00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:17.700
Who says it didn't work out?

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:19.970
The day's not over yet.

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:23.260
Here.

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:26.740
Come on.

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:28.610
Then let me wish you

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:31.700
a long life.

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:34.740
Then, you have to live long, too.

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:35.820
- Come on.
- Cheers.

00:36:40.804 --> 00:36:42.160
Give it to me. I'll drink with you.

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:45.620
Another sip, one more.

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:48.880
Slow down.

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:50.410
It's gone again.

00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:51.420
I'll top it up for you.

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:08.080
Still worried about the unit?

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:18.130
It's just that

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:20.450
I already told Lin Mei.

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:23.220
She's bound to be disappointed.

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:25.650
And my parents.

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:28.010
They don't say it,

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:30.380
but they must be anxious.

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:32.940
And

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:37.170
I feel like I've let you down.

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:39.420
I suggested we get married.

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:41.260
Now the unit's gone.

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:42.670
In the future,

00:37:43.582 --> 00:37:45.337
you'll even be considered twice married.

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:49.610
I don't regret it.

00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:58.740
You said earlier today

00:37:59.050 --> 00:38:00.860
that you had a way
to get the unit back.

00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:02.380
What way?

00:38:05.093 --> 00:38:06.300
Are you afraid of losing face?

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:08.570
Of course I am.

00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:10.740
What if losing face

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:12.450
means getting the unit back?

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:14.820
Then, I'll have no fear.

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:24.780
Let's go get the unit back now.

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:27.340
Right now?

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:28.420
How?

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:31.530
Guerrilla tactics.

00:38:55.340 --> 00:39:00.420
(Jiangcheng No. 1 Textile Factory)

00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:58.900
Should we think this through?

00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:01.090
This is Ms. Xu's office.

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:03.340
Do you still want the unit?

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:07.130
Give me a hand.

00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:30.960
What am I even doing?

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:35.450
I'm lying in an office with a man.

00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:38.820
You said you weren't
afraid of losing face.

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:43.820
Are you sure

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:45.760
this will get your unit back?

00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:49.520
It's our unit.

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:53.530
If the factory won't give it to us,

00:40:54.115 --> 00:40:55.310
I'll sleep here until they do.

00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:57.490
That's right.

00:40:57.970 --> 00:40:59.271
I'll stay and sleep with you.

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:04.490
I mean,

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:05.900
I'll stay here with you.

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:08.780
I mean,

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:10.582
you sleep here,
and I'll sleep here, too.

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:22.450
If Ms. Xu scolds you
tomorrow morning,

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:24.810
just put all the blame on me.

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:27.010
She already thinks I'm a patient,

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:28.720
that my mind works on and off.

00:41:29.804 --> 00:41:31.337
Say you were worried about me,

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:33.300
that you had to stick by me.

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:35.260
Whatever I do,

00:41:35.315 --> 00:41:36.260
you just follow along.

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:38.520
Got it?

00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:48.170
What?

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:50.810
Turn around.

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:52.900
Turn around.

00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:58.420
Hey!

00:41:58.420 --> 00:41:59.820
Don't grab the blanket.

00:42:10.182 --> 00:42:11.040
What are you doing?

00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:12.240
Why are you moving?

00:42:12.693 --> 00:42:13.900
Taking my clothes off.

00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:15.050
You...

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:16.610
Why?

00:42:16.737 --> 00:42:18.040
We can't do things halfway.

00:42:18.382 --> 00:42:19.737
I've got an undershirt on.

00:42:20.804 --> 00:42:21.915
I'll take mine off, too.

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:22.970
No.

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:25.915
I've got an undershirt on.

00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:27.140
Still no.

00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:29.050
No one takes advantage of my wife.

00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:30.720
I'm not your wife.

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:32.260
Still no.

00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:43.930
Morning, Ms. Xu.

00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:45.000

Morning.

You...

00:42:58.530 --> 00:42:59.180
You two...

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:01.260
What are you doing?

00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:07.220
Morning.

00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:08.940
Ms. Xu.

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:11.740
Fei Ni!

00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:12.970
You...

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:14.740
This is utterly outrageous!
