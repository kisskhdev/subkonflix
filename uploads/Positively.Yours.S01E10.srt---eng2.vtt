[Episode 10]
So I can't lie to deny her.

00:00:49.172 --> 00:00:52.872
It's okay if you doubt me and criticize me.

00:00:52.872 --> 00:00:57.138
But please refrain from excessive criticism

00:00:58.138 --> 00:01:00.905

00:01:00.905 --> 00:01:03.238
I sincerely request this.

00:01:21.445 --> 00:01:24.869
According to him, they are actually in love.

00:01:44.338 --> 00:01:46.638
Why did you do that?

00:01:46.638 --> 00:01:48.705
I told you to hide it.

00:01:49.472 --> 00:01:50.572
I'm sorry.

00:01:50.572 --> 00:01:53.638
But even if I went back,

00:01:53.638 --> 00:01:56.405
I probably would do the same.

00:01:56.405 --> 00:02:00.572

and our Yeol Mu never happened.

I knew it wouldn't be easy when I started,

00:02:44.872 --> 00:02:47.905
so rather than regretting that choice,

00:02:47.905 --> 00:02:50.805
I want to do my best in whatever I can do.

00:02:50.805 --> 00:02:52.272
Thanks for worrying about me.

I thought you were impressive,

00:03:22.238 --> 00:03:24.205

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:28.538

Is that so?

00:03:29.538 --> 00:03:31.072
It seems that stubborn Hui Won

00:03:31.072 --> 00:03:34.872

who could bear all that.

I will take the criticism.

00:04:11.805 --> 00:04:13.238
Even as a man, I admit it.

00:04:13.238 --> 00:04:14.405
I was really surprised.

00:04:14.405 --> 00:04:16.038
Instead of an explanation,
he actually confessed.

00:04:16.038 --> 00:04:17.405
As expected of the President.

00:04:17.405 --> 00:04:19.438
The video views totally exploded too.

00:04:19.438 --> 00:04:22.272
When I checked this morning,
the public opinion seems to have swung,

00:04:22.272 --> 00:04:23.938
and the stock has recovered a lot.

00:04:23.938 --> 00:04:27.438
Honestly, isn't this basically
like proposing,

00:04:27.438 --> 00:04:30.005
saying 'I love you'
in front of the whole country?

00:04:30.005 --> 00:04:31.538
When will I ever get a proposal like that?

- Again?
- Again?

00:04:35.572 --> 00:04:37.205
Wasn't this supposed
to be true love this time?

00:04:37.205 --> 00:04:38.538
It wasn't true love.

00:04:38.538 --> 00:04:40.338
It was triple love, triple love.

00:04:40.338 --> 00:04:43.605
I thought he was a caring,
warm-hearted person.

00:04:43.605 --> 00:04:46.738
But he was taking care of his ex
and even his ex-ex.

00:04:46.738 --> 00:04:48.072
Oh, Manager Jang.

00:04:49.405 --> 00:04:51.238

yesterday's press conference?

I want to be his number one fan.

00:04:52.838 --> 00:04:55.372
Ah, I had some business yesterday, so...

00:04:55.372 --> 00:04:58.117
The President must have
been really impressive.

00:04:58.117 --> 00:05:01.772
Who on earth is the woman
the President is seeing?

00:05:01.772 --> 00:05:02.872
I'm jealous.

00:05:02.872 --> 00:05:05.005
She must have saved
the country in her past life.

00:05:05.005 --> 00:05:06.538
Just the country?

00:05:06.538 --> 00:05:07.938
She probably saved the whole world.

00:05:07.938 --> 00:05:11.038
I think that person must be
just as impressive as the President.

00:05:11.038 --> 00:05:12.438
Se Hyeon, do you know something?

00:05:12.438 --> 00:05:13.805
You talk like you've met her.

00:05:13.805 --> 00:05:15.738
Oh, come on, do you
have to see someone to know?

00:05:15.738 --> 00:05:17.957
Just the look in the President's eyes,
the tremor in his voice

00:05:17.957 --> 00:05:19.005
when he talks about her.

00:05:19.005 --> 00:05:21.272
It tells you everything.

00:05:23.705 --> 00:05:25.772
The President being impressive is one thing,

00:05:25.772 --> 00:05:27.772
but we also have to work impressively.

Yes.

It's not over yet.

00:06:09.505 --> 00:06:10.905
The real beginning starts now.

00:06:10.905 --> 00:06:14.205
Even if public opinion has turned,
it wasn't an action worthy of praise.

00:06:14.205 --> 00:06:15.638
It was a risky move.

00:06:15.638 --> 00:06:18.005
The stock price hasn't
fully recovered yet either.

00:06:18.005 --> 00:06:19.205
I know.

I will take responsibility
until the damages are fully restored.

You'll need to pay even more
attention going forward.

00:06:24.572 --> 00:06:27.638
Still, it falls far short of
the qualifications of a true entrepreneur.

But in terms of making the company
approachable to the public,

00:06:31.505 --> 00:06:33.105
it wasn't a bad choice.

00:12:28.638 --> 00:12:29.705
Thank you.

00:12:29.705 --> 00:12:31.372
Can I drink this instead?

00:12:31.372 --> 00:12:32.538
- Sure.
- I'll enjoy it.

00:12:32.538 --> 00:12:34.172
Hello.

00:12:34.172 --> 00:12:35.172
- Yes.
- Hi.

00:12:35.172 --> 00:12:36.338
Assistant Manager Choi, hair roller.

00:12:36.338 --> 00:12:38.172
- Want to borrow it?
- No, It's fine.

00:12:38.172 --> 00:12:39.872
- Tak Soo.
- Yes.

00:12:42.238 --> 00:12:45.538
Make sure to eat lunch while working.

00:12:45.538 --> 00:12:49.505
Working hard is good,
but think about me sometimes too.

00:12:55.705 --> 00:12:57.572
Thank you.

00:13:11.705 --> 00:13:14.405
But is it really this hard
to go on a date once?

00:13:14.405 --> 00:13:16.205
There isn't much time left
to submit the contest.

00:13:16.205 --> 00:13:17.205
Please bear with me for a few days.

00:13:17.205 --> 00:13:19.705
I know you're more ambitious than anyone.

00:13:19.705 --> 00:13:23.605
But I'm worried you might
get sick from overworking.

00:13:23.605 --> 00:13:26.438
I didn't plan to push this far.

00:13:26.438 --> 00:13:29.338
But as I prepared, I became ambitious.

00:13:29.338 --> 00:13:31.405
After giving up studying in Germany,

00:13:31.405 --> 00:13:33.438
I wondered when I'd get
another chance like this.

00:13:33.438 --> 00:13:35.272
I thought maybe this contest

00:13:35.272 --> 00:13:37.105
could be that chance.

00:13:37.105 --> 00:13:41.138
A brand bearing my name, the next Try Beer.

00:13:41.138 --> 00:13:43.429
Just thinking about it makes me excited.

00:13:43.429 --> 00:13:46.905
Oh, it's not like I'm asking
for special treatment for no reason.

00:13:46.905 --> 00:13:49.438
Don't misunderstand.

00:13:49.438 --> 00:13:52.205
I was planning to step out of judging anyway.

00:13:52.205 --> 00:13:54.472
If our relationship gets out later,

00:13:54.472 --> 00:13:56.872
it could cause unnecessary gossip.

00:13:56.872 --> 00:14:00.572
So for this contest, just do everything
you want to do without holding back.

00:14:00.572 --> 00:14:02.272
Okay.

00:14:04.038 --> 00:14:07.205
Oh, and by the way,
are you free this weekend?

00:14:07.205 --> 00:14:11.365
My parents suggested
we have a casual meal together.

00:14:11.365 --> 00:14:12.772
Oh.

00:14:12.772 --> 00:14:14.805
If you feel pressured, you can decline.

00:14:14.805 --> 00:14:16.905
We can do it another time
when we have the chance.

00:14:16.905 --> 00:14:18.105
Sounds good.

00:14:18.105 --> 00:14:19.638
They'd probably be curious.

00:14:19.638 --> 00:14:20.838
Please set it up.

00:14:20.838 --> 00:14:23.172
I'll properly introduce myself to them.

00:14:27.872 --> 00:14:29.705
Is this too conservative?

00:14:29.705 --> 00:14:32.005
Or maybe too drab?

00:14:32.005 --> 00:14:33.672
Then this one...

00:14:33.672 --> 00:14:36.105
Hey, Jang Hui Won.

00:14:36.105 --> 00:14:37.372
I knew you'd be like this.

00:14:37.372 --> 00:14:39.505
You still haven't picked your outfit?

00:14:40.405 --> 00:14:41.438
Look.

00:14:41.438 --> 00:14:44.438
Is this better? Or this one?

00:14:44.438 --> 00:14:47.238
I guess I should skip tight clothes
now that my belly's showing more, right?

00:14:47.238 --> 00:14:51.238
You're wearing this
to meet your future in-laws?

00:14:51.238 --> 00:14:53.338
I must have been out of my mind then.

00:14:53.338 --> 00:14:56.261
Why did I agree to go?

00:14:56.261 --> 00:14:58.538
Look at this one.

00:14:58.538 --> 00:15:01.372
How about this dress?

00:15:02.672 --> 00:15:04.738
- Stylish, right?
- Not at all.

00:15:04.738 --> 00:15:05.772
Absolutely not.

00:15:05.772 --> 00:15:08.438
Take that off and follow me.

00:15:10.872 --> 00:15:13.672
Hey, wait!

00:15:18.138 --> 00:15:19.272
Hello, Director.

00:15:19.272 --> 00:15:20.305
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:15:20.305 --> 00:15:23.738
Today, my friend must
look elegant yet graceful,

00:15:23.738 --> 00:15:25.405
clear yet vivid,

00:15:25.405 --> 00:15:26.661
and finally with a touch of lovely,
juicy charm.

00:15:26.661 --> 00:15:28.869
You know what I mean, right?

00:15:29.872 --> 00:15:31.172
Isn't that too much?

00:15:31.172 --> 00:15:35.605
Do you know how many couples
got married after just one touch from her?

00:15:35.605 --> 00:15:38.905
Please start. I'm counting on you.

00:15:58.438 --> 00:16:01.305
Carry my bag. I'm so nervous.

00:16:26.738 --> 00:16:28.305
You've waited long, haven't you?

00:16:28.305 --> 00:16:30.005
Shall we go?

00:16:31.872 --> 00:16:32.972
Why?

00:16:32.972 --> 00:16:35.638
Is it too much after all?

00:16:36.338 --> 00:16:37.638
You look so beautiful.

00:16:37.638 --> 00:16:39.638
You've always been this beautiful.

00:16:39.638 --> 00:16:43.438
But if you keep getting prettier every day,
how am I supposed to handle it?

00:16:43.438 --> 00:16:44.572
Ah, you're exaggerating.

00:16:44.572 --> 00:16:46.505
I don't know. Let's hurry.

00:16:46.505 --> 00:16:48.738
No, not exaggeration.
I'm speaking from the heart.

00:16:48.738 --> 00:16:51.105
Hurry up. They're waiting.

00:16:51.105 --> 00:16:52.605
But aren't you nervous at all?

00:16:52.605 --> 00:16:55.538
I'm nervous. I'm shaking like crazy. Come on.

00:16:55.538 --> 00:16:57.605
Why are you so nervous?

00:16:59.505 --> 00:17:02.205
Was the trip here difficult?

00:17:02.205 --> 00:17:03.472
And are you feeling okay physically?

00:17:03.472 --> 00:17:05.272
Yes, I'm fine.

00:17:05.272 --> 00:17:07.338
Thank you for your concern.

00:17:07.338 --> 00:17:10.705
I felt a bit uneasy
sending you off like that last time.

00:17:10.705 --> 00:17:14.205
Please take it as meddling
from parents who lost a child.

00:17:14.205 --> 00:17:15.405
Not at all.

00:17:15.405 --> 00:17:16.772
I completely understand.

00:17:16.772 --> 00:17:17.772
What do you mean, last time?

00:17:17.772 --> 00:17:19.905
Father, have you met Hui Won before?

00:17:19.905 --> 00:17:23.338
Only she and I know about this secret.

00:17:23.338 --> 00:17:25.505
You don't need to know.

00:17:25.505 --> 00:17:28.205
How can that be? You didn't even tell me.

00:17:28.205 --> 00:17:32.938
Anyway, since you're pregnant,
shouldn't you take a break from work?

00:17:32.938 --> 00:17:35.505
- Pardon?
- Hui Won is exceptionally capable.

00:17:35.505 --> 00:17:36.738
So she has a lot on her plate.

00:17:36.738 --> 00:17:39.238
Did I ask you?

00:17:39.238 --> 00:17:43.772
I'm worried it might be hard
since she's carrying a child.

00:17:43.772 --> 00:17:46.305
Does the company know about the pregnancy?

00:17:46.305 --> 00:17:47.805
We want to take it slow on that.

00:17:47.805 --> 00:17:49.605
They don't know yet.

00:17:49.605 --> 00:17:50.605
Why not?

00:17:50.605 --> 00:17:53.472
Is there some reason you can't reveal it?

00:17:53.472 --> 00:17:56.138
Does she need a reason?

00:17:56.138 --> 00:17:59.005
It's probably because
their relationship is still a secret.

00:17:59.005 --> 00:18:01.972
I'm just asking because I'm curious.

00:18:01.972 --> 00:18:05.238
Because I know nothing about this young lady.

00:18:06.072 --> 00:18:09.505
Given the nature of our work, pregnant
employees often get reduced workloads.

00:18:09.505 --> 00:18:11.805
Or get removed from projects.

00:18:11.805 --> 00:18:13.505
Even when stepping back,

00:18:13.505 --> 00:18:15.972
I want to wrap things up as much as possible.

00:18:15.972 --> 00:18:19.005
This is all out of consideration
for the team.

00:18:24.105 --> 00:18:25.805
I'm sorry.

00:18:26.605 --> 00:18:29.572
Excuse me, it's a bit chilly in here.

00:18:29.572 --> 00:18:31.505
Could you raise the temperature?

00:18:31.505 --> 00:18:33.638
Yes, one moment.

00:18:39.813 --> 00:18:41.572
Um, here.

00:18:41.572 --> 00:18:43.438
Alright.

00:18:43.438 --> 00:18:45.038
Thank you.

00:18:45.038 --> 00:18:46.538
I was a bit cold.

00:18:46.538 --> 00:18:48.938
Actually, I was cold too.

00:18:48.938 --> 00:18:52.738
Thanks to you, it feels
so warm and comfortable.

00:18:52.738 --> 00:18:53.738
Okay, let's dig in.

00:18:53.738 --> 00:18:56.972
Yes, I'll enjoy it.

00:19:00.872 --> 00:19:02.172
Was it tiring today?

00:19:02.172 --> 00:19:04.705
It was fun. They were both really nice.

00:19:04.705 --> 00:19:07.905
I apologize for my mom
being irritable earlier.

00:19:07.905 --> 00:19:09.738
She's not normally like that, but today...

00:19:09.738 --> 00:19:13.005
It's because she cares about you so much.

00:19:13.005 --> 00:19:16.338
She wants her son to be with a good woman.
That's why she acts that way.

00:19:16.338 --> 00:19:18.738
Where else can I find a woman as good as you?

00:19:18.738 --> 00:19:21.405
And my mom too...

00:19:21.405 --> 00:19:23.872
I'm jealous. Your family seems so warm.

00:19:23.872 --> 00:19:26.272
Your family is nice,

00:19:26.272 --> 00:19:27.512
but I don't have a father,

00:19:27.512 --> 00:19:29.538
and my relationship with my mom is strained.

00:19:29.538 --> 00:19:31.405
Of course, she wouldn't like me.

00:19:31.405 --> 00:19:33.005
Not like you? Who wouldn't?

00:19:33.005 --> 00:19:34.472
My mom would never think that way.

00:19:34.472 --> 00:19:35.505
Don't misunderstand that.

00:19:35.505 --> 00:19:38.772
Besides, in this day and age,
divorce happens,

00:19:38.772 --> 00:19:40.172
and mothers and daughters argue sometimes.

00:19:40.172 --> 00:19:44.572
If anyone says anything about that,
bring them to me. I'll teach them a lesson.

00:19:48.838 --> 00:19:49.972
And

00:19:49.972 --> 00:19:53.238
your mother must have
acted out of deep affection.

00:19:53.238 --> 00:19:56.072
She really cares about you.

00:19:56.072 --> 00:19:58.205
It's just a different way of showing it.

00:19:58.205 --> 00:20:00.238
How do you know that, President?

00:20:00.238 --> 00:20:02.138
My mom isn't like that at all, okay?

00:20:02.138 --> 00:20:04.138
What if I'm right about this?

00:20:07.272 --> 00:20:11.172
I'm sorry to visit unannounced,
but I felt it was the right thing to do.

00:20:11.172 --> 00:20:13.638
With all the commotion online,

00:20:13.638 --> 00:20:15.738
it's impossible to ignore.

00:20:15.738 --> 00:20:18.972
I sincerely apologize for causing concern.

00:20:18.972 --> 00:20:19.972
I saw it well.

00:20:19.972 --> 00:20:21.772
Thank you

00:20:23.272 --> 00:20:26.205
for keeping your word back then.

00:20:26.205 --> 00:20:28.872
I hope Hui Won

00:20:28.872 --> 00:20:30.638
doesn't live

00:20:31.905 --> 00:20:34.305
like I did.

00:20:37.672 --> 00:20:39.372
So

00:20:40.205 --> 00:20:42.438
keep that promise.

00:20:43.205 --> 00:20:45.805
I'll be watching for now.

00:20:50.038 --> 00:20:51.905
Okay.

00:21:07.838 --> 00:21:11.305
Your mother must have
acted out of deep affection.

00:21:11.305 --> 00:21:14.138
She really cares about you.

00:21:23.438 --> 00:21:25.541
[Mom]

00:21:31.005 --> 00:21:32.165
[Mom]

00:21:42.505 --> 00:21:45.405
How was your meeting with
your future daughter-in-law?

00:21:47.605 --> 00:21:50.138
What a shame. Invite me
to the formal meeting too.

00:21:50.138 --> 00:21:52.105
We're family after all.

00:21:53.072 --> 00:21:56.072
What brings you here unannounced?

00:21:57.105 --> 00:21:58.672
I believe the time has come.

00:21:58.672 --> 00:22:01.872
You remember what I said before, right?

00:22:01.872 --> 00:22:03.605
Give me Taehan Liquor.

00:22:03.605 --> 00:22:04.972
It was supposed to be Han Jun's anyway.

00:22:04.972 --> 00:22:06.005
What if I say no?

00:22:06.005 --> 00:22:10.272
You'll see for yourself why you
have no choice but to say yes.

00:22:10.272 --> 00:22:14.438
Well, it probably wasn't
that important a matter.

00:22:14.438 --> 00:22:16.105
Then I'll tell you again.

00:22:16.105 --> 00:22:19.405
Co-President of Taehan Liquor.

00:22:19.405 --> 00:22:21.405
Let's start from there.

00:22:21.405 --> 00:22:23.838
The murderer who killed
his brother for power.

00:22:23.838 --> 00:22:27.672
Du Jun has been through so much
because of this, you know.

00:22:27.672 --> 00:22:28.738
But what can I do?

00:22:28.738 --> 00:22:30.738
The next heir of Taehan Group

00:22:30.738 --> 00:22:35.472
abused drugs, even psychiatric medication.

00:22:36.738 --> 00:22:38.938
What should I do next?

00:22:38.938 --> 00:22:41.105
Knock it off!

00:22:42.338 --> 00:22:45.405
Once again, you only think of your son.

00:22:45.405 --> 00:22:49.272
The trauma from back then
can't repeat itself, right?

00:23:26.172 --> 00:23:27.438
What now, again?

00:23:27.438 --> 00:23:28.472
What brings you here?

00:23:28.472 --> 00:23:30.338
I guess you haven't heard yet.

00:23:30.338 --> 00:23:34.105
I'm here as the representative
of Taehan Liquor.

00:23:34.105 --> 00:23:35.838
What did you say?

00:23:43.338 --> 00:23:47.272
As of today, we're co-presidents.

00:23:49.405 --> 00:23:50.505
Let's get along well.

00:23:50.505 --> 00:23:52.305
What does that mean?

00:23:52.305 --> 00:23:54.238
Co-presidents?

00:23:55.872 --> 00:23:58.972
The board discussed your dismissal.

00:23:58.972 --> 00:24:00.805
Who would entrust a company

00:24:00.805 --> 00:24:03.038
to someone relying on drugs to manage it?

00:24:03.038 --> 00:24:07.405
They claimed your press conference outburst
was due to unmedicated mood swings.

00:24:07.405 --> 00:24:11.105
That medication was properly
prescribed. Who would...

00:24:11.105 --> 00:24:13.672
Try saying that in front of the board.
Who would believe such a thing?

00:24:13.672 --> 00:24:17.238
I think the time for focusing
on the truth has passed.

00:24:17.238 --> 00:24:19.705
The board thinks that recently,

00:24:19.705 --> 00:24:21.138
your actions are not

00:24:21.138 --> 00:24:24.838
those of a company owner.

00:24:25.472 --> 00:24:29.472
So I'll be joining you for a while.

00:24:29.472 --> 00:24:32.638
I'll attend all meetings and schedules
going forward. Be aware.

00:24:32.638 --> 00:24:34.372
Then who decided this?

00:24:34.372 --> 00:24:36.638
- If the Chairman knew...
- It was the Chairman's decision.

00:24:36.638 --> 00:24:39.238
You hadn't heard yet?

00:24:39.238 --> 00:24:42.672
The communication between
father and son is really...

00:24:42.672 --> 00:24:44.405
Go ask him for the details.

00:24:44.405 --> 00:24:45.829
So,

00:24:45.829 --> 00:24:48.805
where should I sit?

00:24:57.838 --> 00:24:58.872
Unbelievable!

00:24:58.872 --> 00:25:01.038
Big news! Big news!

00:25:01.038 --> 00:25:04.472
We have a new co-president at our company!

00:25:04.472 --> 00:25:05.638
Then what about President Kang Du Jun?

00:25:05.638 --> 00:25:08.138
Rumor has it he's been
on psychiatric medication,

00:25:08.138 --> 00:25:09.438
quite a lot of it.

00:25:09.438 --> 00:25:10.872
The President? Is it fake news?

00:25:10.872 --> 00:25:16.372
No, because of the trauma, they say
daily life is impossible without medication.

00:25:16.372 --> 00:25:20.338
It hasn't even been long since the scandal
explanation, and now a drug controversy too.

00:25:20.338 --> 00:25:21.805
This might be quite troublesome.

00:25:21.805 --> 00:25:22.838
Right?

00:25:22.838 --> 00:25:25.172
So what will happen to President now?

00:25:25.172 --> 00:25:26.438
Is he getting kicked out?

00:25:26.438 --> 00:25:27.972
Huh?

00:25:27.972 --> 00:25:29.172
That's ridiculous.

00:25:29.172 --> 00:25:30.638
That can't be true.

00:25:30.638 --> 00:25:32.805
How would you know
whether it makes sense or not?

00:25:32.805 --> 00:25:36.438
Like last time, do you know
anything about this?

00:25:36.438 --> 00:25:39.172
- That's not it.
- It's not even verified information yet.

00:25:39.172 --> 00:25:40.305
Let's not jump to conclusions.

00:25:40.305 --> 00:25:42.638
The rumors could be distorted,
like with the previous scandal.

00:25:42.638 --> 00:25:45.838
Let's just trust him and wait.

00:25:45.838 --> 00:25:48.038
Yeah, our president would never.

00:25:48.038 --> 00:25:51.005
Oh, no way.

00:25:51.005 --> 00:25:54.005
Hey, tell them not to spread weird rumors.

00:25:54.005 --> 00:25:55.205
We have enough to worry about already.

00:25:55.205 --> 00:25:58.238
Anyway, this needs to be precise.

00:25:58.238 --> 00:26:00.672
After that day, whenever someone
touched my hand, even slightly,

00:26:00.672 --> 00:26:02.738
my body would freeze automatically.

00:26:02.738 --> 00:26:05.172
Is it because of his hands?

00:26:15.305 --> 00:26:16.485
[Market share trends by sales channel]

00:26:19.572 --> 00:26:22.192
[Risk flag for sales share trends by channel]
Convenience store channel share dropped

00:26:22.192 --> 00:26:24.338
from 23% last year to 19% this year.

00:26:24.338 --> 00:26:27.838
A four percent drop
is pretty serious, isn't it?

00:26:27.838 --> 00:26:31.372
Instead, big mart share rose by 3.8%.

00:26:31.372 --> 00:26:32.738
The margin here is much higher.

00:26:32.738 --> 00:26:36.872
For export volumes here,
the Southeast Asia margin rate is 12%.

00:26:36.872 --> 00:26:38.538
After shipping costs,
is there any profit left?

00:26:38.538 --> 00:26:42.772
You may not get it yet, but Southeast Asia
prioritizes market share capture.

00:26:42.772 --> 00:26:44.905
How long will you focus
solely on market share?

00:26:44.905 --> 00:26:47.138
Last month's
sales fulfillment rate was halved.

00:26:47.138 --> 00:26:49.172
When you ran the hotel, President Han,

00:26:49.172 --> 00:26:53.438
even if you lowered margins off-season,
wasn't room occupancy your priority?

00:26:53.438 --> 00:26:54.938
The liquor industry is no different.

00:26:54.938 --> 00:26:58.305
Shouldn't we consider
the entire industry is in a recession?

00:27:02.405 --> 00:27:04.138
Interesting.

00:27:05.105 --> 00:27:08.238
Speaking of which,
there's an ongoing in-house contest.

00:27:08.238 --> 00:27:09.305
How's that progressing?

00:27:09.305 --> 00:27:10.538
Ah, yes.

00:27:10.538 --> 00:27:11.605
Following Try Beer,

00:27:11.605 --> 00:27:14.038
we decided to actively incorporate
ideas from all employees

00:27:14.038 --> 00:27:16.472
to create the next flagship beer
for Taehan Liquor.

00:27:16.472 --> 00:27:18.272
And we're actually awarding cash prizes.

00:27:18.272 --> 00:27:20.101
[Finding the Next Try Beer]
We're even considering launching

00:27:20.101 --> 00:27:21.438
the first-place winner's idea as a product,

00:27:21.438 --> 00:27:23.845
so I hear the employees
are preparing diligently.

00:27:23.845 --> 00:27:26.272
[Award details]
Well, the prize money seems stingy for that.

00:27:26.272 --> 00:27:28.272
We should triple the prize money

00:27:28.272 --> 00:27:30.905
and most importantly, instead of
keeping this internal,

00:27:30.905 --> 00:27:32.772
we need to promote it widely,

00:27:32.772 --> 00:27:35.472
so consumers can get excited too.

00:27:35.472 --> 00:27:38.838
When the winning product launches,
let everyone try it themselves.

00:27:38.838 --> 00:27:40.572
What do you think?

00:27:46.638 --> 00:27:48.872
What's this? Domestic hop ale beer?

00:27:48.872 --> 00:27:51.772
[Domestic hop ale beer]
Yes, that's our team's new product.

00:27:51.772 --> 00:27:52.838
Domestic hops?

00:27:52.838 --> 00:27:53.938
Interesting.

00:27:53.938 --> 00:27:55.138
What's the production cost?

00:27:55.138 --> 00:27:58.438
- Well, the cost...
- It's still in testing phase.

00:27:59.472 --> 00:28:01.405
That makes cost control even more critical.

00:28:01.405 --> 00:28:05.105
Without cost management,
even the best idea is useless.

00:28:05.105 --> 00:28:06.805
Let's call the person in charge.

00:28:06.805 --> 00:28:09.005
- Pardon?
- Why do we need the person in charge here?

00:28:09.005 --> 00:28:11.472
If you're curious, ask me.

00:28:11.472 --> 00:28:12.472
Why?

00:28:12.472 --> 00:28:15.972
Is there a reason I can't call them directly?

00:28:28.772 --> 00:28:30.372
The concept is refreshing from the start.

00:28:30.372 --> 00:28:32.205
And it has market potential.

00:28:33.605 --> 00:28:34.638
Thank you.

00:28:34.638 --> 00:28:37.772
I'm curious about the proper way
to drink and appreciate it.

00:28:37.772 --> 00:28:39.605
Can you demonstrate it?

00:28:39.605 --> 00:28:43.138
From pouring into the glass to tasting.

00:28:43.972 --> 00:28:47.138
Why must it be done during the meeting?

00:28:47.138 --> 00:28:48.872
Ask me after the meeting is over.

00:28:48.872 --> 00:28:49.872
It'll be quick,

00:28:49.872 --> 00:28:52.138
and the person in charge is already here.

00:29:08.672 --> 00:29:10.338
I'm inexperienced in this,

00:29:10.338 --> 00:29:15.205
so I wanted to see how to pour
and taste it properly to enjoy the flavor.

00:29:15.205 --> 00:29:17.238
If she directly handled the product,

00:29:17.238 --> 00:29:19.538
it must be different, right?

00:29:33.338 --> 00:29:35.138
I apologize.

00:29:36.572 --> 00:29:37.572
Actually, I'm currently...

00:29:37.572 --> 00:29:39.405
Are you joking right now?

00:29:40.405 --> 00:29:42.949
Manager Jang, didn't you know the prototype
had quality issues

00:29:42.949 --> 00:29:45.072
so we scrapped the entire batch?

00:29:45.872 --> 00:29:48.905
I'm sorry, but I received a late report
that the hop farm had financial issues,

00:29:48.905 --> 00:29:51.605
which affected the prototype quality.

00:29:51.605 --> 00:29:55.338
I'll report to you as soon as
the redeveloped prototype is ready.

00:29:55.338 --> 00:29:57.805
It's my fault. I sincerely apologize.

00:29:57.805 --> 00:29:59.505
I'm sorry.

00:30:14.038 --> 00:30:16.805
So you are really pregnant?

00:30:16.805 --> 00:30:20.105
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you earlier.

00:30:20.105 --> 00:30:23.805
But I did my utmost
not to affect the project.

00:30:23.805 --> 00:30:25.805
I never neglected my duties

00:30:25.805 --> 00:30:27.938
due to pregnancy, not even once.

00:30:28.938 --> 00:30:30.305
So?

00:30:30.305 --> 00:30:33.105
I'll step down if I must.

00:30:33.105 --> 00:30:36.138
I'll prepare the handover.

00:30:40.572 --> 00:30:42.638
You're the one in charge, aren't you?

00:30:43.738 --> 00:30:44.738
Pardon?

00:30:44.738 --> 00:30:47.238
So you have to take responsibility
until the very end.

00:30:47.238 --> 00:30:49.005
Keep going as far as you can.

00:30:49.005 --> 00:30:51.305
Whether it's tasting or condition issues,

00:30:51.305 --> 00:30:53.072
get help from the team.

00:30:53.072 --> 00:30:54.338
Just because you're pregnant
doesn't mean you can't work.

00:30:54.338 --> 00:30:56.005
Don't be stubborn,

00:30:56.005 --> 00:30:58.405
trying to do everything alone.

00:31:06.172 --> 00:31:07.438
Team Leader.

00:31:07.438 --> 00:31:09.705
Why did you help me earlier?

00:31:09.705 --> 00:31:12.472
You don't even like me, Team Leader.

00:31:12.472 --> 00:31:14.205
Do I not?

00:31:15.738 --> 00:31:18.038
Well, you're my junior at work.

00:31:18.038 --> 00:31:19.738
What?

00:31:19.738 --> 00:31:22.672
I'm the only one who can scold you.

00:31:24.005 --> 00:31:26.372
- Team Leader.
- Get out.

00:31:39.405 --> 00:31:43.172
I explicitly told you not to mess with her.

00:31:45.872 --> 00:31:49.472
I've tolerated you this far out of respect
for my brother, but I have my limits.

00:31:49.472 --> 00:31:53.172
Do you think I came here just for you?

00:31:53.172 --> 00:31:55.005
What do you mean by that?

00:31:55.005 --> 00:31:57.405
Manager Jang is quite capable, you know.

00:31:57.405 --> 00:32:02.005
It's a shame that such talent
is overshadowed by you.

00:32:02.938 --> 00:32:05.438
Please just stay still.

00:32:05.438 --> 00:32:07.172
If you'd just stay put,

00:32:07.172 --> 00:32:10.405
I plan to give opportunities
to the capable Manager Jang to shine.

00:32:10.405 --> 00:32:12.838
But if you try to do something,

00:32:12.838 --> 00:32:15.738
I'll bet everything to block
Manager Jang's path.

00:32:15.738 --> 00:32:17.838
I'll do it if I decide to.

00:32:17.838 --> 00:32:19.005
You know that, right?

00:32:19.005 --> 00:32:20.205
Then give it your best shot.

00:32:20.205 --> 00:32:21.905
I'll also do whatever it takes this time

00:32:21.905 --> 00:32:25.105
to stop you, no matter what.

00:32:34.105 --> 00:32:35.805
Father!

00:32:35.805 --> 00:32:37.372
What on earth is going on?

00:32:37.372 --> 00:32:39.205
Did something happen with Jeong Eum?

00:32:39.205 --> 00:32:41.738
Looks like Moo Young and she
are really set on playing this game.

00:32:41.738 --> 00:32:44.005
They've swayed
the entire board to their side,

00:32:44.005 --> 00:32:46.605
so there was nothing I could do immediately.

00:32:46.605 --> 00:32:49.905
We don't need executives who only
care about their own interests.

00:32:49.905 --> 00:32:50.938
We should just take them all down at once.

00:32:50.938 --> 00:32:54.138
You know better than anyone
that's not the point.

00:32:54.138 --> 00:32:55.738
To overcome this situation,

00:32:55.738 --> 00:32:58.338
you must conquer it yourself.

00:32:58.338 --> 00:33:00.038
Otherwise that trauma

00:33:00.038 --> 00:33:03.905
will trip you up at another critical moment.

Yes.

00:34:00.705 --> 00:34:03.438
Nothing. You were really
startled earlier, weren't you?

00:34:03.438 --> 00:34:04.705
I should have stopped it beforehand.

00:34:04.705 --> 00:34:07.172
Is this the time to worry about me?

00:34:08.672 --> 00:34:12.572
I know exactly what kind of person she is.

00:34:12.572 --> 00:34:13.972
Will you really be okay?

00:34:13.972 --> 00:34:15.805
Co-presidents? Seriously?

00:34:15.805 --> 00:34:18.505
I'm already preparing countermeasures.

00:34:18.505 --> 00:34:22.138
I won't just sit back and take it this time,
so don't worry too much.

00:34:22.138 --> 00:34:23.138
I'll help too.

00:34:23.138 --> 00:34:24.272
Just tell me what to do.

00:34:24.272 --> 00:34:25.638
Leave this to me.

00:34:25.638 --> 00:34:28.338
Hui Won, just stay by my side as you are now.

00:34:28.338 --> 00:34:30.572
That's enough for me.

00:35:21.705 --> 00:35:22.738
Mom.

00:35:22.738 --> 00:35:24.305
It's the board's decision.

00:35:24.305 --> 00:35:25.738
Is there any reason to refuse?

00:35:25.738 --> 00:35:26.738
That makes no sense.

00:35:26.738 --> 00:35:28.538
Uncle isn't taking weird drugs or anything.

00:35:28.538 --> 00:35:30.405
Why is the company pushing him like this?

00:35:30.405 --> 00:35:32.238
Are you really going as far as
proposing his dismissal?

00:35:32.238 --> 00:35:34.172
It was your dad's anyway.

00:35:34.172 --> 00:35:38.705
He would've passed Taehan Liquor to you.

00:35:38.705 --> 00:35:40.472
So it was you, Mom.

00:35:41.405 --> 00:35:42.772
You were behind it all.

00:35:42.772 --> 00:35:45.272
If you feel wronged,
participate in the voting.

00:35:45.272 --> 00:35:46.938
If you want to use your voting rights.

00:35:46.938 --> 00:35:48.905
How could you? You know
about my relationship with Uncle.

00:35:48.905 --> 00:35:51.772
Your uncle is the one
who made you lose your father.

00:35:51.772 --> 00:35:55.438
He's the one who destroyed our family.

00:35:55.438 --> 00:35:59.072
You think he'll still look out for you
once he has his own real family?

00:35:59.072 --> 00:36:00.072
Make your choice.

00:36:00.072 --> 00:36:01.705
Me or your uncle?

00:36:01.705 --> 00:36:02.872
That's ridiculous.

00:36:02.872 --> 00:36:05.905
What do I even have left?

00:36:05.905 --> 00:36:07.672
For me,

00:36:09.372 --> 00:36:11.605
you're all I've got now.

00:36:29.238 --> 00:36:30.572
In other words,

00:36:30.572 --> 00:36:33.905
since the drug scandal involving
President Kang Du Jun has erupted,

00:36:33.905 --> 00:36:37.505
our board has concluded
saving the situation is no longer possible.

00:36:37.505 --> 00:36:38.772
I can't accept this.

00:36:38.772 --> 00:36:40.705
Using someone's private
medical records like this?

00:36:40.705 --> 00:36:43.305
The President's health
isn't a private matter.

00:36:43.305 --> 00:36:45.305
It directly impacts the company's management.

00:36:45.305 --> 00:36:49.205
I even doubt whether the decisions
made so far were based on sound judgment.

00:36:49.205 --> 00:36:52.772
I've performed my duties with a sound mind,
and my track record proves it.

00:36:52.772 --> 00:36:55.572
Would someone like that
commit such impulsive acts?

00:36:55.572 --> 00:36:59.672
You can't even manage a simple
handshake at official events.

00:36:59.672 --> 00:37:04.172
Isn't the fact that you haven't
overcome that handshake trauma

00:37:04.172 --> 00:37:06.672
already a sign of insufficient
leadership qualities?

00:37:06.672 --> 00:37:08.605
For a businessperson,
a handshake signifies trust.

00:37:08.605 --> 00:37:11.972
Is it acceptable to fail
to build even that much trust?

00:37:11.972 --> 00:37:13.989
That's true.

00:37:13.989 --> 00:37:17.138
Makes sense, he can't even do that.

00:37:17.138 --> 00:37:21.305
Why not step down voluntarily at this point?

00:37:21.305 --> 00:37:25.905
Rumors are widespread that you hold
the position by bloodline, not merit.

00:37:25.905 --> 00:37:28.772
At least do it
if there's any conscience left.

00:37:28.772 --> 00:37:30.438
Let's just start voting right now.

00:37:30.438 --> 00:37:32.672
Exactly. What's the point of delaying?

00:37:32.672 --> 00:37:34.172
The result will be the same anyway.

00:37:34.172 --> 00:37:38.341
- Fine.
- Let's vote right now.

00:37:38.341 --> 00:37:40.505
- Let's vote.
- Come on.

00:37:40.505 --> 00:37:43.372
Well, if that's how everyone feels,

00:37:43.372 --> 00:37:44.672
we'll proceed with the vote now...

00:37:44.672 --> 00:37:48.905
Board matters must be notified
at least a week in advance.

00:37:48.905 --> 00:37:51.938
I surely mentioned it
on the day I came to work.

00:37:51.938 --> 00:37:54.538
That your dismissal would soon
be discussed at the board meeting.

00:37:54.538 --> 00:37:57.638
Is a casual remark in the office
considered legal notice?

00:37:58.372 --> 00:38:00.838
Decisions made by a board meeting
with stakeholders directly involved

00:38:00.838 --> 00:38:02.772
may have legal issues.

00:38:02.772 --> 00:38:04.638
If you insist on voting today,

00:38:04.638 --> 00:38:08.172
I will hold every single person
here accountable.

00:38:08.172 --> 00:38:09.637
Do you

00:38:09.637 --> 00:38:11.838
still wish to proceed?

00:38:16.705 --> 00:38:19.772
So what exactly are you trying to say?

00:38:19.772 --> 00:38:21.738
Give me two weeks.

00:38:21.738 --> 00:38:25.538
I'm asking for the chance to explain myself
through proper procedures.

00:38:25.538 --> 00:38:27.493
It's not too late

00:38:27.493 --> 00:38:29.938
to vote then.

00:38:41.938 --> 00:38:45.738
Does he really think he can get
anything done in two weeks?

00:38:45.738 --> 00:38:47.072
Not a chance.

00:38:47.072 --> 00:38:50.172
What's in it for you joining forces with her?

00:38:51.738 --> 00:38:53.072
What's this all of a sudden?

00:38:53.072 --> 00:38:57.672
Do you really think she will
stand with you until the end?

00:38:57.672 --> 00:38:59.572
Don't even think about provoking me.

00:38:59.572 --> 00:39:01.072
It's a waste of time anyway.

00:39:01.072 --> 00:39:04.472
The incident fifteen years ago,
you remember it, right?

00:39:06.538 --> 00:39:09.838
Those of you who helped turn me
into a murderer back then.

00:39:09.838 --> 00:39:15.372
The journalists you were close with then
are now all department heads or deputy heads.

00:39:15.372 --> 00:39:18.772
It's all in the past.
What can you possibly do?

00:39:18.772 --> 00:39:22.605
True. Unfortunately, there's no
evidence for that case.

00:39:22.605 --> 00:39:24.505
Then how about this?

00:39:24.505 --> 00:39:28.772
You've been manipulating the financial
statements little by little for 11 years.

00:39:28.772 --> 00:39:33.338
Do you really think I don't know
where all that slush fund money went?

00:39:35.838 --> 00:39:38.305
Fortunately, I haven't told Father yet.

00:39:38.305 --> 00:39:40.305
But he'll find out soon enough.

00:39:40.305 --> 00:39:42.072
Wait a minute.

00:39:42.072 --> 00:39:44.305
Let me think for a moment...

00:39:44.305 --> 00:39:46.538
I'm giving you an opportunity right now.

00:39:46.538 --> 00:39:49.138
Cut ties with her and persuade the board.

00:39:49.138 --> 00:39:51.905

you are finished too.

00:39:51.905 --> 00:39:53.938
You understand that, right?

00:39:58.638 --> 00:40:00.338
No, wait...

00:40:08.038 --> 00:40:10.172
So, how was it?

00:40:10.172 --> 00:40:11.938
Did it hit the mark?

00:40:11.938 --> 00:40:13.405
Seems like he roughly understood.

00:40:13.405 --> 00:40:15.005
So what are you going to do now?

00:40:15.005 --> 00:40:16.972
I'm going to stick with the plan.

00:40:16.972 --> 00:40:19.672
I've thrown out the bait,
so something will bite.

00:40:19.672 --> 00:40:21.372
When are you going to reveal the evidence?

What about the rest?

00:42:19.338 --> 00:42:21.338
Assistant Manager Choi!
Skipping me just like that?

00:42:21.338 --> 00:42:23.372
I'll go. Everyone else
is okay with it, right?

00:42:23.372 --> 00:42:25.605
Ah, I have plans today.

00:42:25.605 --> 00:42:27.072
- I'm sorry.
- Come on.

00:42:27.072 --> 00:42:28.472
Ah, why?

00:42:28.472 --> 00:42:31.305
I've been pushing myself too hard
lately, so I'm not feeling well.

00:42:31.305 --> 00:42:32.305
Ah, really?

00:42:32.305 --> 00:42:36.338
When your condition is off,
one shot of soju will wipe the fatigue.

00:42:36.338 --> 00:42:38.672
Why are you pressuring
someone who's unwell to drink?

00:42:38.672 --> 00:42:40.472
I didn't force it, but I'm just disappointed.

00:42:40.472 --> 00:42:43.205
I know, she must be the most disappointed.

00:42:43.205 --> 00:42:45.272
Why are you feeling
disappointed on her behalf?

00:42:45.272 --> 00:42:49.838
If anyone in our team forces alcohol,
you'll get a serious scolding from me.

00:42:49.838 --> 00:42:50.838
Got it?

00:42:50.838 --> 00:42:52.638
Yes.

00:42:52.638 --> 00:42:54.272
What's gotten into Team Leader?

00:42:54.272 --> 00:42:56.938
Taking Manager Jang's side completely?

00:42:56.938 --> 00:42:57.972
Exactly.

00:42:57.972 --> 00:42:59.405
When did I ever force anyone?

00:42:59.405 --> 00:43:01.972
The leader does the forcing daily!

00:43:01.972 --> 00:43:03.705
I can hear everything.

00:43:04.638 --> 00:43:05.638
What should we eat?

00:43:05.638 --> 00:43:06.705
Let's have pork belly.

00:43:06.705 --> 00:43:07.705
I know a place.

00:43:07.705 --> 00:43:10.572
There's a great spot nearby.
It's newly opened, and it's amazing.

00:43:10.572 --> 00:43:12.305
Nice.

00:43:21.405 --> 00:43:23.572
Doors closing.

00:43:25.172 --> 00:43:27.838
By the way, I apologize for last time.

00:43:27.838 --> 00:43:30.472
I momentarily forgot you were pregnant.

00:43:30.472 --> 00:43:31.472
It's okay.

00:43:31.472 --> 00:43:33.138
You're not happy I came, are you?

00:43:33.138 --> 00:43:37.305
You wonder if I'm scheming again
around him, right?

00:43:38.805 --> 00:43:41.605
I can't say I don't.

00:43:41.605 --> 00:43:45.072
I'm not someone who mixes
personal feelings into work.

00:43:45.072 --> 00:43:48.938
When I look at you,
it's like seeing my old self.

00:43:48.938 --> 00:43:51.372
That's why I feel more invested, perhaps.

00:43:51.372 --> 00:43:55.138
Especially after reviewing
the projects you handled recently.

00:43:55.138 --> 00:43:57.738
Honestly, I see you in a new light.

00:43:59.338 --> 00:44:02.838
I want to properly support you going forward.

00:44:02.838 --> 00:44:05.305
- What do you mean?
- Just tell me what you want.

00:44:05.305 --> 00:44:07.872
I can support you with anything.

00:44:07.872 --> 00:44:10.138
Your dream.

00:44:11.038 --> 00:44:13.338
I can make it come true.

00:44:13.338 --> 00:44:16.272
No, you don't need to do that.

00:44:17.172 --> 00:44:19.705
I've done well

00:44:20.838 --> 00:44:23.338
on my own so far.

00:44:23.338 --> 00:44:25.338
And my dream

00:44:26.438 --> 00:44:30.705
wouldn't mean anything
if someone forced it to happen.

00:44:32.517 --> 00:44:33.541
Doors opening.

00:44:33.541 --> 00:44:37.238
Thank you for the offer, though.

00:44:37.238 --> 00:44:38.972
Then...

00:44:44.305 --> 00:44:47.238
Is it true our company president
went to yours?

00:44:47.238 --> 00:44:50.038
But didn't you say she is
your president's sister-in-law?

00:44:50.038 --> 00:44:52.972
What is this? It's not even
a sibling rivalry. Is it a family feud?

00:44:52.972 --> 00:44:54.705
It just made the company atmosphere awkward.

00:44:54.705 --> 00:44:56.838
Ugh, this is making me dizzy.

00:44:56.838 --> 00:44:57.925
So where are you now?

00:44:57.925 --> 00:44:59.405
Me? On my way home.

00:44:59.405 --> 00:45:00.472
Huh? Let's get food.

00:45:00.472 --> 00:45:01.572
I'm heading home now too.

00:45:01.572 --> 00:45:03.905
Now? I want to rest a bit today.

00:45:03.905 --> 00:45:04.938
Huh?

00:45:04.938 --> 00:45:06.838
Min Uk is probably waiting by now.

00:45:06.838 --> 00:45:08.538
Huh?

00:45:26.905 --> 00:45:28.638
- Well...
- Well...

00:45:29.272 --> 00:45:31.105
- You go first.
- No.

00:45:31.105 --> 00:45:32.805
You go first.

00:45:32.805 --> 00:45:35.105
Mine's not a big deal.

00:45:36.772 --> 00:45:39.872
How's the President doing lately?

00:45:39.872 --> 00:45:42.905
Strange rumors are going around the company.

00:45:44.205 --> 00:45:49.538
I heard before he was suffering
from something like insomnia.

00:45:49.538 --> 00:45:51.372
It seems he's still

00:45:51.372 --> 00:45:53.605
being misunderstood because of it.

00:45:53.605 --> 00:45:55.472
But I'm not sure.

00:45:55.472 --> 00:45:59.172
He doesn't tell me the details.

00:45:59.872 --> 00:46:02.472
I guess he's worried you might worry.

00:46:05.572 --> 00:46:09.205
I can guess what's troubling him,

00:46:09.205 --> 00:46:12.305
but I can't solve it for him right now.

00:46:13.138 --> 00:46:16.805
That makes me feel a bit sorry and sad.

00:46:22.505 --> 00:46:25.738
Yeah, this is exactly Jang Hui Won.

00:46:25.738 --> 00:46:30.205
You stand up for others' problems
like they're your own.

00:46:35.638 --> 00:46:38.672
That's always been your admirable quality.

00:46:38.672 --> 00:46:43.172
But I think I was too focused on myself.

00:46:43.172 --> 00:46:44.305
Sorry.

00:46:44.305 --> 00:46:46.705
- Hey.
- So don't worry about it.

00:46:46.705 --> 00:46:51.305
With our bond this strong,
no storm can shake us, right?

00:46:51.972 --> 00:46:53.701
Still,

00:46:53.701 --> 00:46:54.872
tell me if you need help.

00:46:54.872 --> 00:46:57.272
I'll always be on your side.

00:46:58.572 --> 00:47:00.305
Okay.

00:47:01.205 --> 00:47:03.872
Let's go. Mi Ran must be waiting.

00:47:03.872 --> 00:47:05.572
Yeah.

00:47:08.472 --> 00:47:11.372
Are you available for a quick call?

00:47:14.272 --> 00:47:15.305
The dismissal proposal?

00:47:15.305 --> 00:47:17.938
Yes, Du Jun told me not to tell you.

00:47:17.938 --> 00:47:21.338
But I felt you needed to know, Ms. Hui Won.

00:47:21.338 --> 00:47:22.372
Ah.

00:47:22.372 --> 00:47:25.072
Since you're the most important
person to Du Jun right now.

00:47:25.072 --> 00:47:26.872
If you're by his side,

00:47:26.872 --> 00:47:32.438
he might feel comfortable
enough to unburden himself.

00:47:48.272 --> 00:47:49.338
What happened?

00:47:49.338 --> 00:47:51.472
What's going on with the President?

00:47:51.472 --> 00:47:53.838
There seems to be internal complications.

00:47:53.838 --> 00:47:56.638
I want to help the President,

00:47:56.638 --> 00:47:57.672
but I don't know how.

00:47:57.672 --> 00:47:58.772
I heard at the company

00:47:58.772 --> 00:48:01.338
that the President can't shake hands.

00:48:01.338 --> 00:48:02.605
Could it be because of that?

00:48:02.605 --> 00:48:03.605
Shake hands?

00:48:03.605 --> 00:48:06.213
Oh, a psychological issue?

00:48:06.949 --> 00:48:10.438
How about therapy together?

00:48:10.438 --> 00:48:13.805
He already goes to therapy, I believe.

00:48:13.805 --> 00:48:15.938
But I don't mean anything fancy.

00:48:15.938 --> 00:48:18.538
Just having a drink with you guys,
talking over my worries,

00:48:18.538 --> 00:48:20.172
and maybe trashing some people a bit

00:48:20.172 --> 00:48:21.772
can make me feel so much better.

00:48:21.772 --> 00:48:22.772
Hey, who knows?

00:48:22.772 --> 00:48:26.938
If he just spills his thoughts
over a drink with you...

00:48:26.938 --> 00:48:28.972
Oh, right, you can't drink.

00:48:28.972 --> 00:48:30.972
What a shame.

00:48:32.372 --> 00:48:34.638
Spill his thoughts?

00:48:36.338 --> 00:48:39.305
I think I should go see him.

00:48:39.305 --> 00:48:40.338
Huh? What?

00:48:40.338 --> 00:48:41.772
What about dessert?

00:48:41.772 --> 00:48:43.538
Sorry, today you guys go without me.

00:48:43.538 --> 00:48:44.838
I'll contact you later.

00:48:44.838 --> 00:48:46.105
Uh, well...

00:48:46.105 --> 00:48:50.072
Then we'll just have dessert ourselves.

00:48:54.738 --> 00:48:56.872
Let's just eat this and go.

00:48:56.872 --> 00:48:57.905
Huh?

00:48:57.905 --> 00:48:59.872
Didn't you say we were
going for dessert earlier?

00:48:59.872 --> 00:49:00.938
No.

00:49:00.938 --> 00:49:03.472
I'll just head home early to rest.

00:49:09.472 --> 00:49:12.972
About himself, therapy?

00:49:17.605 --> 00:49:20.572
[Trauma Treatment]

00:49:20.572 --> 00:49:22.272
[Group Counseling]

00:49:22.272 --> 00:49:25.925
[Group Therapy]

00:49:27.005 --> 00:49:29.638
Do I even have the right to do this?

00:49:31.238 --> 00:49:34.405
I haven't solved my own issues yet.

00:49:55.472 --> 00:49:57.138
President.

00:49:57.138 --> 00:49:59.472
What brings you here, Hui Won?

00:50:01.238 --> 00:50:03.972
What a liar.

00:50:03.972 --> 00:50:05.738
- What?
- You didn't mention the dismissal proposal.

00:50:05.738 --> 00:50:07.372
Didn't tell me what's troubling you.

00:50:07.372 --> 00:50:10.538
And never once asked for my help.

00:50:10.538 --> 00:50:12.105
After giving me all that lecture,

00:50:12.105 --> 00:50:13.572
you keep doing this yourself?

00:50:13.572 --> 00:50:14.572
I feel hurt.

00:50:14.572 --> 00:50:17.305
But how did you...

00:50:17.305 --> 00:50:20.938
- That Secretary Go.
- Don't you dare blame Secretary Go.

00:50:23.005 --> 00:50:24.472
It's just

00:50:24.472 --> 00:50:28.538
this is my problem to solve.

00:50:30.438 --> 00:50:32.605
You seem to think things

00:50:32.605 --> 00:50:36.738
only have meaning if solved immediately.

00:50:36.738 --> 00:50:38.972
But sometimes,

00:50:38.972 --> 00:50:44.172
just sharing worries has meaning too.

00:50:44.172 --> 00:50:46.605
When I developed the new product,

00:50:46.605 --> 00:50:51.005
I tried crafting recipes
and hop blends alone,

00:50:51.005 --> 00:50:55.972
but my first attempts were always disasters.

00:50:55.972 --> 00:51:00.005
Then when we taste-tested
with the team and talked it out,

00:51:00.005 --> 00:51:03.505
I started seeing solutions.

00:51:03.505 --> 00:51:07.005
Not that we found any grand solution,

00:51:07.005 --> 00:51:08.772
but

00:51:08.772 --> 00:51:13.272
sharing made the path clearer.

00:51:22.338 --> 00:51:24.438
So I want to ask,

00:51:24.438 --> 00:51:27.738
are you free the day after tomorrow?

00:51:27.738 --> 00:51:30.605
I need you, President.

00:51:41.905 --> 00:51:43.905
Would this be okay?

00:51:45.338 --> 00:51:50.005
Since you talked about Mom last time,
I couldn't call her first.

00:51:50.005 --> 00:51:51.938
Just thinking about her,

00:51:51.938 --> 00:51:56.105
I feel lost on where to begin.

00:51:56.972 --> 00:51:59.638
But if you're with me,

00:51:59.638 --> 00:52:03.138
I think I'll find courage.

00:52:03.138 --> 00:52:04.138
Well done.

00:52:04.138 --> 00:52:06.438
Don't worry, I'll stick right by you.

00:52:06.438 --> 00:52:08.138
Let's go.

00:52:15.238 --> 00:52:19.738
It's been four years
since my daughter has been a shut-in.

00:52:19.738 --> 00:52:22.005
I was even kneeling at the door.

00:52:22.005 --> 00:52:25.072
- I've hated my father my whole life.
- But she wouldn't come out.

00:52:25.072 --> 00:52:26.505
- Because he hit me a lot.
- Let alone see me.

00:52:26.505 --> 00:52:28.505
- When I was a sophomore in college...
- When I look at her...

00:52:28.505 --> 00:52:30.138
It's all my fault.

00:52:30.138 --> 00:52:31.138
If only he had said that one thing...

00:52:31.138 --> 00:52:33.638
I want to see Ju Won's face.

00:52:33.638 --> 00:52:35.838
- I wouldn't have to resent him like this.
- I want to hold her hand just once.

00:52:35.838 --> 00:52:37.872
Let's give him some time.

00:52:37.872 --> 00:52:41.372
Is there anyone else?

00:52:54.805 --> 00:52:58.105
Yes, would you like to share?

00:53:00.172 --> 00:53:02.038
I...

00:53:07.838 --> 00:53:12.838
I have a difficult relationship with my mom.

00:53:13.605 --> 00:53:15.405
My mom always

00:53:15.405 --> 00:53:20.238
thought I ruined her life.

00:53:20.938 --> 00:53:22.538
So she constantly said

00:53:22.538 --> 00:53:24.933
that it's

00:53:24.933 --> 00:53:27.305
all my fault.

00:53:27.305 --> 00:53:30.638
My life got completely ruined because of you.

00:53:30.638 --> 00:53:33.238
If it weren't for you, I...

00:53:33.238 --> 00:53:34.905
If it weren't for you...

00:53:34.905 --> 00:53:37.138
Giving birth to you was
a mistake from the start.

00:53:37.138 --> 00:53:39.905
My life has been a mess
ever since then. Satisfied?

00:53:39.905 --> 00:53:41.105
You bad girl.

00:53:41.105 --> 00:53:43.372
How can you only think
about yourself until the very end?

00:53:43.372 --> 00:53:46.872
You should never have been born.

00:53:46.872 --> 00:53:48.605
But now,

00:53:50.272 --> 00:53:53.872
I'm about to become a mom.

00:53:53.872 --> 00:53:55.272
Oh my, congratulations!

00:53:55.272 --> 00:53:57.505
Everyone, let's give her a round of applause.

00:53:57.505 --> 00:54:00.138
Congratulations, really.

00:54:07.805 --> 00:54:11.005
I always

00:54:11.005 --> 00:54:15.738
gave up and avoided dealing with my mom.

00:54:15.738 --> 00:54:18.905
So when I realized I'm becoming a mom,

00:54:18.905 --> 00:54:21.438
I was really scared at first.

00:54:21.438 --> 00:54:23.338
Afraid I might say

00:54:23.338 --> 00:54:24.472
to my child,

00:54:24.472 --> 00:54:27.638
'it's all your fault,'

00:54:27.638 --> 00:54:30.338
like my mom did.

00:54:30.338 --> 00:54:34.972
But after meeting my baby's dad,

00:54:34.972 --> 00:54:40.505
who promised to care for
and protect me consistently,

00:54:40.505 --> 00:54:43.905
I felt this inexplicable confidence.

00:54:44.938 --> 00:54:47.405
Thanks to him,

00:54:47.405 --> 00:54:49.638
I want to understand

00:54:50.305 --> 00:54:52.838
my mom better.

00:54:58.672 --> 00:55:03.905
Because I want to give
this child proper love.

00:55:03.905 --> 00:55:07.105
To do that, I need to first...

your relationship with your mom, right?

Yes.

You did great, really.
It couldn't have been easy.

you calmly shared your story
in front of all those people, right?

I don't think everything will be
resolved with this one attempt.

00:56:20.905 --> 00:56:24.805
I'm just trying to
think of it as the first step.

Shall we go then?

00:56:27.705 --> 00:56:29.438
Yes.

Don't let go. Don't give up, please!
