Eons ago,

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.470
there was one ancient sword

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.190
called Skysplitter,

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.800
or the Chosen's Sword.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.800
[Young Ye Zhixin]
The strongest sword

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.000
[Jinxuan]
can only be wielded by the ruler

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.800
chosen by the Heavenly God.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.840
They said

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.150
once the Skysplitter appeared,

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.470
the world would undergo a great transformation.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.800
After Emperor Xiao Yi of Beili

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.870
restored peace to the world with Skysplitter,

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.520
the sword has become

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.750
the symbol of a ruling dynasty and heaven's mandate.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.080
Once Skysplitter is unsheathed,

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.120
its aura can tear the world asunder.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.240
It is the very definition of the Chosen's Sword.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.470
For centuries,

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.080
it was slumbering inside a hidden pavilion of Tianqi City.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.280
Until that elusive crown prince returned to Tianqi.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.240
His imperial blood and Earthsundering Blade Technique roused the sword.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.560
Even though Skysplitter already has an owner,

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.280
it is nonetheless a blade of feud,

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.960
destined to create more conflicts.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.630

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:12.550
When did the door close?

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:13.360
No idea.

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:13.720
I...

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.080
Why can't I open this door?

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:16.270
Calm down.

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:17.360
At this moment,

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:18.120
we must

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:19.000
find a way out.

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:20.390
Right.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.000
Find a way out.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:21.910
Find a way out.

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:42.030
It's just two snowmen.

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:42.720
What's so

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:43.480
scary about them?

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:44.200
San.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:45.790
Go ahead and examine them.

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:49.390
Now!

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:50.750
Hurry up.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:03.480
San!

00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:04.600
San, are you okay?

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.110
Stay here.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:05.550
San.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:06.270
San.

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:07.200
San.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.070
Something's wrong with these snowmen.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.880
How did they attack?

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.000
Si!

00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:19.640
Look at him.
