DRAWING TECHNIQUE

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.280
L.P.N.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.160
You possessed kid. You ghost-seer.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.080
-Boo!
-Possessed kid. Boo!

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.400
-Boo! You ghost-seer.
-Possessed kid.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.000
-Possessed kid, boo!
-You possessed kid, boo!

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.400
Take this. Consecrated rice!

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.400
Go away, evil spirit. Yah!

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.440
-You possessed kid.
-Possessed kid.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.720
Stop!

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.640
Ow!

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.600
POSTMODERN ARCHITECTURE

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.720
Wake up, Ms. Kluayhom.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.800
Ugh. Why are you waking me up, Sompaen?

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.520
Huh? Still going back to sleep?

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.400
Get up, sis. Hurry. Wake up. You're late.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.440
Five more minutes.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.000
-No. Open your eyes.
-Ugh…

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.880
-Open your eyes.
-Five minutes. Really.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.520
I just went to bed at 4 a.m.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.720
You fall asleep while working
your whole life. And what is this?

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.400
-Ow…
-Hey.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.120
Why would you redesign this?
If they told you to remove it, just do it.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.680
It's so messy.
Not pretty at all. Remove it.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.160
There's a crying sound.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.600
Crying sound? Ah!

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.800
Oh, sorry, sorry. I was just joking.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.920
Actually, it looks nice like this.
It's cute.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.480
Hey, are you messing with me again?

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.760
-No.
-See? You always do this.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.800
That's why things get messy.
I'm done talking. Go downstairs now.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.760
Mom made toast.
If it gets cold, she'll complain.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.880
Hurry.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.080
-You nag like Mom.
-You're always teasing me.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.520
Fine, I'm getting up.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.800
Ugh.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.160
Mm.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.600
If I can't fight for it today,
we'll probably have to remove it.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.560
I'm coming.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.120
Oh?

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.520
Enjoy your breakfast.
I'll go check on the kids.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.600
Hello, hello.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.640
Mom, why does theirs
look better than mine?

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.920
Jealous of little kids, are you?

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.280
You're a grown-up now.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.120
-I'll help, Mom.
-It's okay, dear.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.640
Hey. Som told me you stayed up late again.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.600
A little, Mom.
I had to revise a design for a client.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.240
I don't want them to remove
the rose arbor. It's so beautiful.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.520
-Hey.
-Hm?

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.480
Don't go telling people
about bad omens again, alright?

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.720
FRESH VEGETABLES

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.640
You won't make any money today.
Your stall will be ruined.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.280
You foul-mouthed brat!

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.640
Are you cursing me? Get out!

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.760
You…

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.760
If you're going to run,
go that way. It'll be safer.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.840
-Huh? Still taking?
-Uh…

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.320
Kluay.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.280
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Let's go.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.240
-Kluay, go.
-Teach your kid some manners.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.680
Come on. Let's go.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.360
You won't pay your debt
and you still dare open your stall?!

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.080
Well, what’s it gonna be?

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.920
Pretending to cry?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.520
Too late to beg me now! Well?!

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.320
Mom.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.040
Can I share some snacks
with Cartoon and Fifa?

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:16.920
Sure.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.200
Why are you looking at me like that, Mom?

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.480
Okay, okay. I promise I'll zip my mouth
completely shut. I won't say a word.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.840
So, Kluay what?

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.240
Kluay loves everyone.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.640
But Kluay won't get involved in this.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.800
Mm.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.920
Very good. Go on. Hurry. Good luck, dear.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.400
-Thank you. Can I have a hug?
-Yeah.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.800
Even though we're not related by blood,
Mama Toi has always loved me.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.640
-Please take care of this for me.
-Alright.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.640
-This is Ban Saeng Wan Mai, my home.
-Hello, kids.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.560
Mama Toi took me in
when I was little and adopted me.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.680
You need a ride, Ms. Kluayhom?

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.360
This is Som,
Mama Toi's biological daughter,

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.240
born not long after I was adopted.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.600
Such a jealous kid, Sompaen.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.360
Ugh.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.120
I'm in a hurry.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.360
I'm coming now.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.840
That dream again?

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.120
Ugh.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.880
I only slept a bit.
Why does it feel so long?

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.640
Mr. Warat. Mr. Warat.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.200
Here you are.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.760
Is something wrong?

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.040
Do you know how worried I was?
I called and you didn't answer.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:30.160
That was the fastest drive from Bangkok
to Hua Hin in my life. It was dangerous.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:31.800
Mr. Arnon.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.919
I had the same dream again.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.840
You dreamed of that woman again?

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.240
It's happening a lot

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.640
ever since I came back to Thailand.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.960
I don't know why. When I was in the US,

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.440
I never dreamed like this.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.560
It's not strange to dream frequently.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.600
You saw that woman
in the rose arbor house.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.600
I'm planning to find time
to go take a look

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.680
after finishing my father's matters,

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.640
before heading back.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.360
Mr. Warat, it's too late.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.880
Mrs. Wanee ordered the demolition
of the rose arbor house today.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:10.840
Huh?

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.720
Why didn't I know?

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.960
I didn't know either.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:19.080
I had to find out myself.
She didn't let outsiders know at all.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.960
Hey, but I'm not an outsider.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.600
Where are you going?

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.560
Grandma has no right
to demolish that house.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:38.480
This was the only way
to lure Warat back from Hua Hin,

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.360
because he loves his father's
rose arbor house so much.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:47.960
With the utmost respect, ma'am. So,
we wouldn't need to order the demolition?

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:52.200
Once Mr. Warat returns to Bangkok,
you'll have me stop the work, correct?

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.560
No.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.880
Because either way,

00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:00.400
I've already decided
to demolish that rose arbor house.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.960
Back then, Wichan was ill.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.920
But now…

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.560
Let Kluay continue her work,
just speed it up.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:25.560
By the time Warat returns,
Kluay will have finished everything.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.040
Yes, ma'am.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.360
Thank you very much, Supol.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:37.360
But the order I received was to remove
the rose arbor, not the whole house.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.640
The order just came today.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.200
Oh, but still, Mr. Supol,

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.800
I've already planted trees
all over the area.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:50.880
If you want the house demolished, I'll
need time to move the trees out first.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.920
I don't think it can be finished today.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.480
I don't know whether you can or can't.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.520
My job is to receive orders
and inform you.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.040
Mr. Supol, just a moment…

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.880
Oh? Ugh.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.520
Everyone.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.200
Stop giving orders right now.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.960
Get out. All of you, get out!

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.120
Get out.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.360
All of you, get out. Go!

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.680
Who are you?

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.840
Who are you?
How dare you demolish my house?

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.080
Your house? That's ridiculous.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.920
Or are you Mr. Supol's contractor?

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.880
-Can you give me some time?
-Get out.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.120
Hey, why are you chasing my team away?

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.320
-Can you wait? Let me finish my work.
-Shut up.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.320
Get out.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.800
What is wrong with you?

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.040
You didn't listen,
so this is how it has to be. Go.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.840
Help me…

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.320
-What's wrong with you?
-You…

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.480
Wow. So dramatic, huh?

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.880
You…

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.080
You need to make merit.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.760
Are you crazy?

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.760
-Uh…
-Do you want to take meds? Go.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.320
Help me…

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.480
Ugh, please let me go.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.880
Are you okay?

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.640
-Uh…
-Should we take you to a doctor?

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.960
Please… please leave.
I promise I'll handle it.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:18.840
Hey.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:22.960
Hey.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.960
Apply some pressure,
so the blood circulates.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.400
Once she wakes up, go tell Mr. Warat.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.080
Are you sure
we don't need to take her to a doctor?

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.840
Mm. She'll be able to get up in a bit.
It's just heat exhaustion.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.760
Good. I'm too lazy to explain.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.400
I didn't do anything to her.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.680
I shouldn't have let you
drive back from Hua Hin alone.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.400
Now look what happened.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.960
That girl talked weird,

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.920
and she looked like she'd seen a ghost.

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.720
And she even told me to go make merit.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.440
I think you two match well.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.600
One has weird dreams.
The other talks weird.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:10.960
You think that's funny?

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.240
Where's Kluay?

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.840
Are you the one
who had a problem with my sister?

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.400
With the utmost respect,

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:27.480
your sister is over there.
If you want to take her home, please do.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.640
Seriously, both sisters.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.760
Who did Grandma bring in to work?

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.680
Who? Because you refused to come help me.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.080
So I had to get someone else
to do it instead.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.560
Kluay is working for me.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.600
I won't let you demolish
the rose arbor house.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:14:59.960
It's okay, dear.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.520
Think of it as she trusts you,
that's why she came to ask for your help.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.240
But I don't know
if I can stay and help her, Mom.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.600
I've never felt this drained before.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:17.440
Can't you tell her that you can't help?
That you can't handle it anymore?

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.320
I wonder about that myself.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.400
I thought this new job
wouldn't have any problems.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.040
But nope.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:28.200
But I think what's scarier is Mr. Warat,
the chairwoman's grandson.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.360
He looks so good, but his attitude…

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.080
Don't say that about him.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.800
I went too far with him too.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.800
And you need to watch your manners, Som.

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.640
Isn't he going to run Vanich Mall?

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:49.200
I'm in PR, Mom.
I don't deal directly with him.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.400
But even if I have to see him,
don't worry.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:56.040
At work, they call me
"Som the Die-hard PR."

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.720
This is nothing. Easy.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.680
Come on, Kluay.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.920
Let's go sleep. Get up.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.400
-Kluay, relax.
-Ugh, you're heavy.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:12.080
Alright, sweetheart?
Tomorrow I'll go consult Grandpa for you.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:16.520
Right, Grandpa could meditate
and see who that woman is.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.720
Hey, hey.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.440
Grandpa doesn't have psychic sight.
He's just a devout man.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.280
-Ah.
-Thank you, Mom.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:28.320
But tomorrow, I think I'm going to resign.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.000
-Again?
-Oh?

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.400
How long do you have to keep running away?

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.400
I don't know.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:45.640
What?

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.480
Don't… Don't tell me.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:03.240
-Mom…
-Mm.

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:09.040
Well, I won't…

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:11.599
I won't resign then.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.359
Come here.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.720
Oh my goodness.

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.520
Grandma.

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.400
Why are you so startled?

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.920
It's you.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.560
If you wanted to come to pray.
Why didn't you sit next to me?

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.680
Standing there quietly scared me.

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.640
I'm not here to pray.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.520
I'm here to talk to you

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.880
about Mom.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:00.520
If you have something to say,
why not talk outside?

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.120
Let's talk here, Grandma.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.880
I believe you won't lie to me
in front of the Buddha.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.960
Rat, can you speak nicely to me?

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.880
Grandma, I don't have much time left.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.840
Do you even hear what you're saying?
Why are you cursing yourself like that?

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.000
Don't let me hear that again, Rat.

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:19.400
Grandma, you're the one being negative.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:23.320
I mean I don't have much time left.
I have to go back to the States.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.280
I want to ask you about Mom one last time.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.840
Then I won't bother you again
for the rest of my life. Okay?

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.720
Warat, what's wrong, dear?

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.320
I had the same dream again.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.480
It's okay, it's okay.
Come sleep with me then.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.600
No. I want to know who that woman is.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:45.920
You must have the answer.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.720
I'll say the same thing.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.800
I have never known
the woman in your dream.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.760
So she's not my mother.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.240
That's funny.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.040
You can't even recognize
your own daughter-in-law?

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:03.600
Enough, Rat. I don't understand
why you're doing this.

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:07.400
How many times
have you pressured me like this?

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.320
Then just tell me.
I just want to know who my mom is.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.400
Stop shouting at me right now, Rat.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.520
Huh.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.920
When I was a kid, you told me

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.760
"You're too young.
You wouldn't understand."

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.000
And now what?

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.640
Am I old enough yet?

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.440
You're still cruel.

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.520
My dad is gone,

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.600
and you're still cruel
and won't say a word about my mom.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.520
Arnon, I've decided.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.880
I'm not going back to America yet.

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.960
I won't resign yet.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.920
This isn't the first time
I've faced something like this, Mom.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.240
Yesterday, I just lost it a little,

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:16.160
so I acted rashly and wanted to quit
and just be done with it.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.120
But I think that isn't right, Mom.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.200
It's good that you realized that, dear.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.840
But you still have to
take care of your heart too.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.560
If you can't handle it, don't force it.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:33.200
I'll endure it. And I'll do this job
until the contract is fulfilled.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:36.760
So, this job will be my last one.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.720
What do you mean?

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.920
It'll be the last job I take
working for other people.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.880
I've caused too much damage to others.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:48.280
After this, I'll open my own plant store.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:52.560
You've wanted to open one
for a long time, haven't you?

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.040
Yes.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.520
Agreed. I'll give one more vote.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:00.920
This time, if there are any bad omens
that stop me from working again,

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.160
it'll be my own store. If there's damage,
it's on me, no trouble for anyone else.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.720
But ideally, let there be no more trouble.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.720
I feel bad for you, Kluay.
You didn't sleep again last night, right?

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.960
So you're not demolishing
this house anymore, right?

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:34.520
Correct.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:41.400
If you're not demolishing it,
why are you throwing things away?

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.240
With the utmost respect,

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.320
these are all Madam's orders.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.560
But the items are still in good condition.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:52.760
Um, I think we should sell them
and donate the money to the poor.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.600
I really can't respond on Madam's behalf.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.920
But let me summarize the scope
of work you're responsible for.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.040
You need to redo the entire landscape,

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.160
flowers, trees,
and also remove this rose arbor.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.720
With the utmost respect,
these are all orders from Madam.

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.160
Remove the rose arbor too?

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.120
Yes.

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.360
Alright.

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.480
Such a shame. It's so beautiful.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.480
Uh… wait.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.320
Huh?

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:32.640
Hm?

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.600
Help me…

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:46.720
Uh…

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.160
Can I take a photo real quick?

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:54.920
Thank you.

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.320
Aw.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:22.960
Investigate everything the way I told you,
then meet me at the office.

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.400
It's good that you're here.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.720
I was just wanting to see you.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.520
I came to see you too.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.240
To see me?

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.560
Aren't you fully recovered?

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.840
Oh, no, I'm fine now.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:59.200
But your grandmother has ordered we stop
the demolition of the rose arbor house.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.360
That's how it should be.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.760
That house will not be demolished

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.560
even if Grandma hadn't ordered it.

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:10.840
But there's something I want you
to go see. Please hurry.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.920
Why should I listen to you?

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:20.280
Oh, okay. I used the wrong words.
Let me rephrase it.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.320
May I invite you to go
to the rose arbor house?

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.600
Don't be sarcastic.

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.680
If you have something to say, say it here.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:30.280
I'll only go to that house when I want to.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:34.400
Yesterday, I saw a woman's spirit
standing beside you.

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.480
The same story again.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:45.560
At first, I thought she was a vengeful
spirit, so I told you to make merit.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:47.600
But…

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.520
-But…
-But what?

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.800
Today,

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:58.480
I saw that woman in a framed picture
at the rose arbor house.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:04.080
She was wearing a white dress,
like a wedding gown,

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.400
standing next to a man.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.320
I've seen that man's face
in the news before.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.920
He's Mr. Wichan, your father.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.440
I think you should hurry and go see it,

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.520
before it gets thrown out. Alright?

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:25.920
Don't tell me

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.600
you talked to my grandmother
about my dreams.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:32.640
Dreams?

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.360
You know I dream
about the woman in that photo,

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:39.720
and now you're making up ghost stories,
vengeful spirit and all that, right?

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:45.760
You must've been hurt a lot
to never trust anyone.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:50.800
Never mind.
At least I've done what I should do.

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.600
And honestly,

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.640
I've never spoken to your grandmother
about anything other than work.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.360
Oh.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:09.240
If you won't go, that's up to you.
I've said my part.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:25.400
This year's policy
hasn't changed much from last year.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.240
Really? But other malls have been
scrambling to adapt to the economy.

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.400
Our mall is independent.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.760
Chairwoman Wanee prefers it this way.

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.200
No stress, no care.

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:40.960
Profits are low, but if the character of
this historic mall remains, that's enough.

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:41.920
That's nice.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.760
I'm a huge fan of Vanich Mall myself.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:49.360
I love it. That fountain over there
looks just like what I saw as a kid.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:53.600
Chairwoman Wanee got the idea from a mall
in London when she was studying there.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:58.240
When she came back to take over the
family business, she did what she liked.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.840
You really know your stuff, Ms. Som.

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.280
Just as I heard.

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.120
Die-hard PR, right?

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:10.000
I hope you'll have enough information
to update our website.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.520
If you need anything else,
you can call me anytime.

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:13.600
Sure. With pleasure.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.760
-Yes, let's continue over there.
-Sure.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.040
Where are you going?

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.720
Oh, you're done with the restroom?

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:34.200
Not yet. The line's long.
I'll go to another floor.

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.240
Then go ahead. Upstairs, right?

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.400
I knew it.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:41.080
No wonder you easily agreed
to come to the mall with me.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.080
Turns out you wanted to see Som,
Kluay's little sister.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:48.400
I had no idea she worked here too.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.800
If you're not going to the restroom,
let's go home.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.400
Why?

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.200
Have you still not moved on from her?

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.440
Be honest,

00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:58.960
what's so good

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.360
about that murderer?

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:04.440
Kluay isn't a murderer.
She didn't kill anyone.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:08.360
You know that very well.
So why do you keep calling her that?

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:10.560
It's been years already.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.400
No matter how many years pass,
I'll still call her that

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.520
if you don't stop being interested in her.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:19.800
Hello, Det.

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:25.480
Oh, Ameena, you came too?

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.080
Wow, you two.

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.280
You've been together for so long.

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.280
Hard to believe you lasted.

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.040
Move.

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:38.720
What's the rush?

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:42.360
I ran all this way to see you.
Please update me on your life first.

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:44.920
May I ask,

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.480
has karma caught up with you yet

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.360
for spreading rumors
that my sister is a murderer?

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.200
Uh, let's talk later, Som.

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.240
Please send my regards to Kluay.

00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.320
Det.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:00.040
Keep your regards to yourself

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:02.960
or give them all to Ameena.

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:07.320
Fake words belong with fake people.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:12.640
They say
a rotten Jack may have as rotten a Jill.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.120
I never thought
I'd see it with my own eyes.

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.960
You're the rotten one, Som.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.680
What?
Ameena, you low-minded so-called elite.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.640
Oh.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.800
How did we end up running into each other?

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.480
A secret reunion without inviting me?

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:27.920
Sin.

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.080
Why are you here?

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:42.240
What are you doing here, you murderer?!

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.280
-Sin. Sin.
-Huh?!

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:45.800
Why are you here?!

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.880
What evidence do you have to accuse her?

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.960
My sister didn't kill your sister.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:51.800
-Don't talk nonsense.
-She didn't kill her?

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.800
-Sin…
-You killed my sister!

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.000
Let me go!

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.560
I'm the one who'll put your sister
in prison! You murderer!

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:02.280
With a top engineer like you around,

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.160
my department's work
becomes a lot easier too.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.720
It's not that big a deal.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.040
I think you should hurry and go see it,

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:39.400
before it gets thrown out. Alright?

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.680
I saw you in my dream.

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.200
What's your name?

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.360
I should have believed you.

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.040
Startled much?

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.160
You sure you're okay?

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:15.280
Hey, why do you always
have to be so blunt with me?

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.600
Can't you talk nicely to me even once?

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.520
This house isn't being demolished now.
What did I ever do to you?

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:24.440
Look. It's already this late
and I still haven't gone home.

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:29.040
Uh, about that picture,
where did you hide it?

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.360
If you're trying to pick a fight,

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.360
I'm begging you, please stop.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:37.320
I'm tired. I just want to go home.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.800
Wait, wait.

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:44.200
Uh, where was the last place
you saw that picture?

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.440
When a worker carried it out
to throw it away.

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.080
Huh? Throw away?

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.000
Yes. I already warned you.

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:50.960
Who ordered it?

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:52.320
Who do you think?

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:55.280
This is too much.

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.200
It's locked.

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.920
Don't tell me we're stuck in here.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.920
-Hey.
-Huh?

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.080
Your phone.

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:12.720
Call someone to help.

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.600
Uh… it's outside.

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.920
What kind of day is this for me?

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.560
Someone, help!

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.360
Traffic jam?

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.480
Traffic jams are nothing, Mom.

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:45.720
What I ran into was way worse.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.560
I won't waste time guessing.

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:53.600
You can fight with
even an ant crossing your path.

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:55.040
If you want to talk, just talk.

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:58.800
-Mom, don't tease me. I'm already upset.
-Heh.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:02.640
Mom, today,
I ran into Jirasin at the office.

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:07.320
Jirasin? Lakkana's brother?

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:12.640
I knew he worked at Vanich Mall,
but at the Chiang Mai branch.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:16.120
I don't know why he suddenly transferred
to the same branch as me.

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.560
What is this?

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:23.320
Both of my daughters
facing work problems at the same time?

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:27.200
I'm not afraid of him, Mom.
If he messes with me, that's one thing.

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:32.400
But if he messes with Kluay again,
I won't let it slide like three years ago.

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:34.040
Hey.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:36.360
Do you think he moved here on purpose

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:40.480
because he knows Kluay works
with Mrs. Wanee at the Vanich mansion?

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:42.480
That's possible.

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:46.480
All those times Kluay kept losing her job,
it was because of Jirasin.

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:50.520
He kept spreading rumors.
That's why she couldn't stay anywhere.

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:55.400
Oh no. What if this time
he tries to destroy Kluay again?

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:58.840
No way, Mom.
He'll have to deal with me first.

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.680
Take it easy, will you?

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.720
You're tiny. What can you even do to him?

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:08.120
I think we should tell Kluay first.

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:11.480
But you two sisters' schedules
rarely match.

00:34:12.199 --> 00:34:14.760
Or should I tell her for you?

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.360
No need. I'll talk to her myself.

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:20.159
But why hasn't Kluay
finished work and come home yet?

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.360
Hey, come sit down.
No one's coming even if you call.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:44.560
Wait a bit longer, it'll be morning soon.
The crew should come by then.

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:47.400
Wait alone if you want. Are you crazy?

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:53.360
Has anyone close to you
ever told you how exhausting it is

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.560
to go against the world all the time?

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:02.760
It's so hot.

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:05.200
So many mosquitoes too.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:19.600
Hey.

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:24.640
You know,
I couldn't sleep at all last night.

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:26.320
You want me

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.800
to ask why, right? Okay.

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:31.320
Why?

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.720
Ms. Mysterious,

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:38.880
the one I saw when I was with you,

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:40.920
she followed me to my house.

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.000
You really expect me to believe

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.120
that you can see ghosts?

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.920
I think it'd be better if you called her
"her," you know.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.200
Or if you apologize to her right now,
it's not too late.

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:14.200
If you don't believe me, why are you
looking around? She's not here.

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:18.600
Uh, that woman really went to your house?

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.560
Why would I lie to you?

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:23.560
But I get it.

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:28.640
No matter what I say, you won't
believe me. That's fine. I'm used to it.

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:31.160
How long have you been
seeing these things?

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.840
Since I can remember.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:38.560
-You ghost-seer! Possessed kid!
-Boo!

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.880
-Possessed kid! You ghost-seer!
-Boo!

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:54.840
Why are you staring at me?

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.160
No, I'm not staring.

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:03.840
You're looking right at me.

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.480
I'm not.

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:08.240
I'm looking at something else.

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:25.520
So, you said you've been dreaming
about her since you were a kid. Really?

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.720
I dreamed of her before

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.000
I ever saw the photo of her
with my father.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:36.760
At first, I thought she was my mother.

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:40.040
But then I thought maybe not.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.440
Uh…

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:53.000
Do you want to know

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:55.680
whether she was or not?

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.880
Why would you ask that?

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:02.440
She's right next to you now.
Do you want me to ask her?

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:05.720
Seriously?

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.400
Yeah.

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:09.400
-Be serious.
-I'm serious.

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:10.520
Left

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.120
or right?

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:31.120
Uh…

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.240
You can't see her,

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.720
but I can see her clearly…

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.720
That woman has to be
connected to me somehow.

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:48.440
That's why we need her help.

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:51.200
Ms. Mysterious really wants us to help.
