{\an8}UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

00:00:54.617 --> 00:00:57.829
Stop interfering and go back
to where you belong, Hong Keum-bo.

00:00:57.912 --> 00:00:59.205
You did it all on purpose, didn't you?

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.332
You intentionally put me on the task force

00:01:01.416 --> 00:01:02.750
and took those documents.

00:01:02.834 --> 00:01:04.460
It's what you wanted.

00:01:06.337 --> 00:01:08.923
Wait. We're on a tight schedule.

00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:10.717
Don't we need a clerical assistant
for menial tasks

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.636
like coffee runs, copies,
and lunch delivery?

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.097
Please help out as much as you can.

00:01:20.143 --> 00:01:20.977
DETAILS OF OUTSTANDING LIABILITIES

00:01:30.612 --> 00:01:33.114
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

00:01:33.197 --> 00:01:34.824
I've gotten in touch with
an overseas investment firm

00:01:34.908 --> 00:01:36.701
that can provide short-term funding.

00:01:36.784 --> 00:01:38.620
It's called DK Ventures,

00:01:38.703 --> 00:01:40.413
and they'll be in Seoul for due diligence.

00:01:40.496 --> 00:01:44.000
What if they try to assert their leverage
to strong-arm us?

00:01:44.083 --> 00:01:45.376
There's no need for concern.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.670
I believe this is where my role comes in.

00:01:47.754 --> 00:01:50.381
I'll handle the negotiations
to ensure the terms are favorable for us.

00:01:52.133 --> 00:01:54.844
All right. Excellent.

00:01:54.928 --> 00:01:55.845
Come in.

00:02:02.185 --> 00:02:03.603
President Shin.

00:02:03.686 --> 00:02:08.233
Let Ms. Song know
once the investor confirms their flight.

00:02:09.234 --> 00:02:12.487
We must show our special guests
the warmest hospitality.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.446
Yes, sir.

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:15.365
I'll let her know as soon as possible.

00:02:15.448 --> 00:02:16.282
Good.

00:02:28.544 --> 00:02:29.671
Ms. Song.

00:02:30.171 --> 00:02:33.341
Do you know why I chose to appoint

00:02:33.424 --> 00:02:36.135
Shin Jung-woo as the president of Hanmin?

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.099
He reached out first back then.

00:02:42.392 --> 00:02:45.353
I remember he sent his condolences
when President Kang passed away.

00:02:45.436 --> 00:02:47.063
Condolences were just an excuse.

00:02:47.605 --> 00:02:49.649
That's how he asserted his presence to me.

00:02:51.943 --> 00:02:54.278
I was also like that when I was younger.

00:02:54.904 --> 00:02:57.573
Shin has agreed to introduce us
to an investor,

00:02:57.657 --> 00:02:59.325
so we must take advantage of that.

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.870
Sir, are you also considering
President Shin

00:03:02.954 --> 00:03:05.999
as a potential son-in-law,
as Madam Choi does?

00:03:06.082 --> 00:03:08.334
We'll have to see
if he's got what it takes.

00:03:10.128 --> 00:03:11.129
Right.

00:03:11.754 --> 00:03:15.258
About the hidden Swiss bank account
under Nora's name…

00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:19.971
Are you certain she and her mother
are still in the dark about it?

00:03:20.054 --> 00:03:23.516
You and I are the only ones
who know about that account.

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:24.517
All right.

00:03:25.977 --> 00:03:28.855
It's time I bring Nora into my house.

00:03:29.897 --> 00:03:31.566
A storm is coming,

00:03:32.984 --> 00:03:35.361
so let us fortify the granary first.

00:03:35.445 --> 00:03:36.279
All right?

00:03:42.285 --> 00:03:44.495
{\an8}FOR LEASE

00:03:47.623 --> 00:03:50.960
{\an8}Jeez, what is happening
to this country's economy?

00:03:51.836 --> 00:03:52.754
{\an8}CLOSING NOTICE

00:03:52.837 --> 00:03:55.340
{\an8}- Two orders of noodles for you.
- Thank you.

00:03:58.593 --> 00:04:01.512
{\an8}I told you to go easy on Yehppee
and coax him,

00:04:01.596 --> 00:04:02.847
{\an8}not finish him off.

00:04:04.223 --> 00:04:06.768
{\an8}Then should I have helped them
with the hidden slush fund

00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:08.728
{\an8}and shamelessly looted
the taxpayers' money?

00:04:08.811 --> 00:04:11.230
{\an8}Bang Jin-mok wasn't wrong, you know.

00:04:11.314 --> 00:04:13.900
{\an8}Even if the IMF crisis makes
Hanmin falter now,

00:04:13.983 --> 00:04:16.277
{\an8}Chairman Kang won't be affected
in the slightest.

00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:19.655
{\an8}Only the innocent employees
will suffer the hit and fallout.

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.616
I think Shin Jung-woo
was onto our investigation

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:23.076
and sabotaged it on purpose.

00:04:24.452 --> 00:04:26.162
He knew exactly what he was doing

00:04:26.245 --> 00:04:29.415
when he put me on that task force
and took the document I prepared.

00:04:29.916 --> 00:04:32.126
It's still too early
to jump to conclusions.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.669
If he wanted to score major points,

00:04:33.753 --> 00:04:36.422
he would've simply handed you over
to Chairman Kang.

00:04:37.131 --> 00:04:38.216
Who knows?

00:04:38.299 --> 00:04:41.886
Shin Jung-woo might be helping you out
without you knowing,

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:43.262
just like he did in the past.

00:04:43.346 --> 00:04:44.680
What do you mean?

00:04:44.764 --> 00:04:46.099
When did he ever help me?

00:04:46.766 --> 00:04:48.184
{\an8}Firing her for whistleblowing alone…

00:04:48.267 --> 00:04:49.102
{\an8}9 YEARS AGO, 1988

00:04:49.185 --> 00:04:50.561
…would be enough to send a warning

00:04:50.645 --> 00:04:52.730
not just to Hong Keum-bo,
but to the whole office.

00:04:52.814 --> 00:04:56.442
And if she leaks those files she has?
What then?

00:04:56.526 --> 00:04:57.693
That won't happen,

00:04:57.777 --> 00:04:59.195
and I'll take responsibility
if it ever does.

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:01.823
Even now, the company needs people
to do the work.

00:05:02.865 --> 00:05:04.283
I'll take over…

00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:06.452
the work Mr. Yun was doing.

00:05:07.703 --> 00:05:09.747
Please just drop the lawsuit
against Hong Keum-bo.

00:05:12.625 --> 00:05:14.085
Back then,

00:05:14.168 --> 00:05:17.171
Shin Jung-woo ran around
as if his life depended on it

00:05:17.255 --> 00:05:19.549
to stop your old firm
from pursuing a retaliatory lawsuit.

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:23.094
Why the hell didn't you tell me sooner?

00:05:25.221 --> 00:05:26.180
That scared me.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.349
Don't get mad at me.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.105
What if you had known sooner?
Would that have changed anything?

00:05:37.024 --> 00:05:38.985
I guess deep down you still have

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:41.612
at least a spoonful of hope left for him.

00:05:43.197 --> 00:05:44.323
Hope, my ass.

00:05:44.407 --> 00:05:46.242
Why would he bother to help me?

00:05:46.325 --> 00:05:48.077
He's about to marry into the Kang family.

00:05:48.161 --> 00:05:49.662
You think he'd walk away
from that opportunity?

00:05:51.164 --> 00:05:52.331
Damn it.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.041
You have a point.

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:59.005
Anyway, all signs point to us
ending the operation.

00:05:59.672 --> 00:06:00.506
Let's wrap it up.

00:06:08.264 --> 00:06:09.557
I mean,

00:06:10.141 --> 00:06:12.101
you went undercover to expose

00:06:12.185 --> 00:06:15.271
corruption within Hanmin's ownership
and management.

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:20.234
The livelihoods of its employees
aren't our responsibility.

00:06:21.068 --> 00:06:23.738
Besides, we're barely
keeping our heads above water as it is.

00:06:23.821 --> 00:06:26.032
They're talking about
financial reform laws and whatnot

00:06:26.115 --> 00:06:28.576
and even possibly disbanding the FSS.

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:30.745
Talk of restructuring
has everyone feeling uneasy,

00:06:31.245 --> 00:06:33.915
so you'll return to the office
by December 8th at the latest.

00:06:37.627 --> 00:06:38.544
You pay for that.

00:06:52.975 --> 00:06:57.980
Amid the worst economic crisis in history,
stock prices have hit a ten-year low.

00:06:58.564 --> 00:06:59.732
Banks and securities firms

00:06:59.815 --> 00:07:03.611
are being hit by waves of withdrawals
and intense client backlash.

00:07:04.153 --> 00:07:07.240
Clients hoping to withdraw their funds
have been gathering in droves

00:07:07.323 --> 00:07:09.742
at these financial institutions,
even before business hours.

00:07:15.248 --> 00:07:17.542
CRIMINAL COMPLAINT:
FRAUD

00:07:19.961 --> 00:07:21.671
{\an8}DEFENDANT: KIM MI-SOOK

00:07:21.754 --> 00:07:25.216
{\an8}THE COMPLAINANT SEEKS DAMAGES
FOR FINANCIAL LOSSES…

00:07:34.809 --> 00:07:35.851
Did you hear?

00:07:35.935 --> 00:07:37.186
The branch manager's playing dumb again.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.063
Even the head office made it clear

00:07:39.146 --> 00:07:41.774
that the employees are responsible
for the funds they sold.

00:07:41.857 --> 00:07:44.402
At our branch,
Kim Mi-sook is in the most trouble.

00:07:44.485 --> 00:07:46.279
I hear she even received
a criminal complaint.

00:07:46.362 --> 00:07:47.863
How could she possibly
compensate them all?

00:07:47.947 --> 00:07:48.823
She's done for.

00:07:48.906 --> 00:07:51.325
At least she's a single woman
without kids.

00:07:51.409 --> 00:07:53.536
You know those debts can be passed down.

00:07:55.413 --> 00:07:56.372
I know, right?

00:08:18.894 --> 00:08:19.979
I knew it.

00:08:20.062 --> 00:08:21.731
I clearly have an eye for these things.

00:08:22.231 --> 00:08:24.609
Let's accentuate that waist a bit more.

00:08:28.821 --> 00:08:31.782
Mom, I just snuck out briefly
during my lunch break.

00:08:32.992 --> 00:08:34.702
I told you earlier, right?

00:08:34.785 --> 00:08:36.704
My daughter's being trained as an heiress.

00:08:37.747 --> 00:08:40.082
We should start bride lessons soon too.

00:08:40.666 --> 00:08:41.542
Oh, right.

00:08:41.626 --> 00:08:44.211
Nora, let's move you into Dad's place
as soon as possible.

00:08:44.795 --> 00:08:48.341
Your dad gave a special order
for you to move in.

00:08:49.675 --> 00:08:51.218
Albert has been living it up

00:08:51.302 --> 00:08:54.138
in your dad's palace of a house
all this time,

00:08:55.097 --> 00:08:58.601
while you've been crammed into
that shoebox with three others.

00:08:59.185 --> 00:09:00.394
It upsets me so much.

00:09:01.646 --> 00:09:02.938
There are five of us, not four.

00:09:03.689 --> 00:09:05.441
What? Five?

00:09:05.524 --> 00:09:06.859
What? It's nothing.

00:09:08.611 --> 00:09:10.571
I think we should
lower the shoulders a bit.

00:09:11.864 --> 00:09:12.865
It's so pretty.

00:09:12.948 --> 00:09:13.949
This side too.

00:09:21.332 --> 00:09:22.958
Hong Jang-mi is actually Hong Keum-bo,

00:09:23.501 --> 00:09:25.211
and Hong Keum-bo works for the FSS.

00:09:25.961 --> 00:09:29.465
The FSS was in charge of
investigating Hanmin's slush fund,

00:09:29.548 --> 00:09:32.551
so did Hong Keum-bo lie her way in here
to dig into the slush fund?

00:09:33.344 --> 00:09:34.387
Is that why…

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:36.347
Where did you get that notebook from?

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:38.265
You took it from the president's office.

00:09:38.349 --> 00:09:40.226
Did you take it knowing about the raid?

00:09:40.309 --> 00:09:41.435
Who told you to?

00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:42.478
Hold on.

00:09:42.978 --> 00:09:45.231
She even knew
the ledger was in the president's office.

00:09:46.315 --> 00:09:47.525
Hong Jang-mi, that crazy brat!

00:09:58.744 --> 00:10:00.287
Jang-mi, how did you know…

00:10:00.996 --> 00:10:03.541
I mean, Ms. Hong,
how did you know about the ledger?

00:10:03.624 --> 00:10:06.836
Because President Kang
had offered it to me as evidence.

00:10:08.045 --> 00:10:09.755
You knew my President Kang?

00:10:10.339 --> 00:10:11.340
Wait.

00:10:12.216 --> 00:10:15.553
But I thought he had that ledger
because he was managing the slush fund.

00:10:17.012 --> 00:10:20.558
You call him your President Kang,
yet know nothing about him.

00:10:22.143 --> 00:10:24.478
So you had no shame
about wanting to steal that money

00:10:24.562 --> 00:10:27.106
because you thought
he was managing the slush fund?

00:10:27.189 --> 00:10:28.023
Hey!

00:10:28.107 --> 00:10:29.775
Anyone would think that.

00:10:29.859 --> 00:10:32.653
Even though he showed me
nothing but respect and kindness,

00:10:32.737 --> 00:10:34.363
he was still the son of a rich chairman.

00:10:34.447 --> 00:10:36.198
He and I came from different worlds.

00:10:36.282 --> 00:10:40.244
President Kang Myeong-hwi
wished to set Hanmin on the right path,

00:10:40.953 --> 00:10:43.956
although he never even got a chance
to stand up to Chairman Kang.

00:10:47.585 --> 00:10:48.794
We met a few times

00:10:48.878 --> 00:10:50.337
to discuss the slush fund probe.

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:04.685
Let's meet up

00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:06.854
at our spot tonight.

00:11:08.314 --> 00:11:09.148
All right.

00:11:15.821 --> 00:11:16.697
Could it be

00:11:17.364 --> 00:11:20.242
that the woman he met
the night before his accident

00:11:21.243 --> 00:11:23.579
was you, Hong Keum-bo?

00:11:23.662 --> 00:11:24.955
How do you know about that?

00:11:27.625 --> 00:11:29.293
Ms. Song knows about it too.

00:11:31.545 --> 00:11:32.755
Could she be suspecting you?

00:11:32.838 --> 00:11:35.216
She did ask me
for your personnel file back then.

00:11:35.299 --> 00:11:37.426
If she knew,
she would've done something by now.

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:38.344
Don't worry.

00:11:40.888 --> 00:11:42.056
Anyway,

00:11:42.139 --> 00:11:44.266
I'm quitting
in the first week of December.

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:45.893
So let's just play dumb until then.

00:11:46.685 --> 00:11:49.021
We'll part ways then and live our lives.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.483
I'll treat you as Queen Bee
until my last day.

00:11:53.901 --> 00:11:56.028
You're only saying that
because it'd hurt you if I dug any deeper.

00:11:57.321 --> 00:11:58.489
That's bold coming from you,

00:11:58.572 --> 00:12:00.491
Ms. Go Bok-hee, the habitual embezzler.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.786
You should be grateful
I'm letting you off the hook.

00:12:03.869 --> 00:12:05.496
I'm not an embezzler!

00:12:05.579 --> 00:12:09.041
Strictly speaking, I've never been
caught or arrested for such crimes.

00:12:09.124 --> 00:12:10.042
Why?

00:12:10.125 --> 00:12:11.752
Because I only went after dirty money.

00:12:11.835 --> 00:12:13.003
You must be so proud.

00:12:14.463 --> 00:12:16.173
Just leave right now.

00:12:16.257 --> 00:12:17.591
I'm done worrying about you.

00:12:17.675 --> 00:12:18.509
Jeez!

00:12:21.845 --> 00:12:24.390
Either express concern or snap at me.

00:12:24.473 --> 00:12:25.849
Choose a lane, will you?

00:12:27.726 --> 00:12:29.228
CRIMINAL COMPLAINT

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:35.234
EPISODE 9: TWO LETTERS

00:12:46.704 --> 00:12:47.746
Who is it?

00:12:49.331 --> 00:12:50.165
Who's there?

00:12:56.297 --> 00:12:58.299
Ms. Kim, why are you at my house?

00:12:58.882 --> 00:12:59.717
Sir.

00:13:02.886 --> 00:13:06.432
The New Korea Fund clients
filed criminal complaints against me.

00:13:07.141 --> 00:13:08.142
You know what happened.

00:13:08.225 --> 00:13:10.519
The head office promoted it
as their flagship product,

00:13:10.603 --> 00:13:13.814
and you kept pushing for us
to raise our sales figures as well.

00:13:13.897 --> 00:13:14.940
Ms. Kim.

00:13:15.024 --> 00:13:16.066
Were you doing volunteer work?

00:13:18.193 --> 00:13:19.028
Pardon?

00:13:19.111 --> 00:13:21.697
The company can't help you
with personal lawsuits.

00:13:22.489 --> 00:13:23.616
Did you do it for the company's sake?

00:13:24.199 --> 00:13:25.743
You did it all for yourself,

00:13:25.826 --> 00:13:27.244
so don't blame me now.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.122
If you feel wronged,
you should pursue legal action.

00:13:30.914 --> 00:13:31.915
Sir.

00:13:32.499 --> 00:13:33.584
Please help me.

00:13:33.667 --> 00:13:35.461
Damn it, stop being such a pain!

00:13:36.462 --> 00:13:38.339
Listen, Ms. Kim.

00:13:38.422 --> 00:13:41.300
Consult a lawyer if you feel so wronged.

00:13:41.884 --> 00:13:43.052
Damn it.

00:14:21.298 --> 00:14:23.384
Welcome home, Auntie.

00:14:24.301 --> 00:14:26.095
Bom, why are you out here alone?

00:14:26.178 --> 00:14:27.680
I'm waiting for Mommy.

00:14:32.017 --> 00:14:32.851
I see.

00:14:34.979 --> 00:14:36.188
Should we page her?

00:14:36.689 --> 00:14:37.523
Yes!

00:14:40.401 --> 00:14:41.652
Let's see here.

00:14:45.698 --> 00:14:48.492
When you're done recording,
press the star or pound button…

00:14:48.575 --> 00:14:49.994
Press "8282."

00:14:50.077 --> 00:14:52.246
8-2-8-2.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:56.500
We just told her to hurry home.

00:15:03.173 --> 00:15:05.592
Once your mom gets home,
you have to go sleep in the room.

00:15:57.436 --> 00:15:59.271
Things must be hectic
at the branch right now.

00:15:59.354 --> 00:16:00.898
It must be tough on you as well.

00:16:08.489 --> 00:16:10.074
I should've known better.

00:16:11.158 --> 00:16:13.327
I put in all that effort for nothing.

00:17:34.199 --> 00:17:35.242
I'm going back to work.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.203
I can't put this off anymore.

00:17:48.922 --> 00:17:49.923
See you.

00:18:11.028 --> 00:18:16.909
SEOUL CITY DORMITORY
FOR SINGLE FEMALE WORKERS

00:18:37.346 --> 00:18:39.973
Even after securing
financial support from the IMF,

00:18:40.057 --> 00:18:42.559
the foreign exchange crisis
shows no sign of easing.

00:18:42.643 --> 00:18:44.561
As uncertainty over the outcome grows,

00:18:44.645 --> 00:18:47.356
{\an8}the anxiety of the people
only continues to deepen.

00:18:47.439 --> 00:18:49.107
{\an8}HEONDAE INN

00:20:31.126 --> 00:20:36.757
{\an8}TO MS. HONG JANG-MI
TO CHAIRMAN KANG PIL-BEOM

00:20:45.223 --> 00:20:47.726
Please process my resignation
as soon as possible.

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:54.983
{\an8}LETTER OF RESIGNATION

00:21:03.492 --> 00:21:06.203
EMERGENCY CONTACTS
MAGANG BRANCH: 3554-2988

00:21:10.999 --> 00:21:12.167
Is this the Magang Branch?

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:15.629
I'm not a client,
but Ms. Kim Mi-sook's roommate.

00:21:17.672 --> 00:21:19.633
She didn't show up to work today?

00:21:25.639 --> 00:21:26.598
Hello?

00:21:26.681 --> 00:21:27.891
Is this Ms. Hong Jang-mi?

00:21:28.392 --> 00:21:29.726
Do you know a Ms. Kim Mi-sook?

00:21:31.186 --> 00:21:32.145
Who's calling?

00:21:35.232 --> 00:21:38.110
Ms. Kim attempted to take her own life,

00:21:38.193 --> 00:21:41.113
and she left behind a suicide note
addressed to you at the scene.

00:21:53.166 --> 00:21:55.710
She left two suicide notes,
one addressed to you

00:21:55.794 --> 00:21:58.422
and one addressed to
Chairman Kang of Hanmin.

00:21:59.172 --> 00:22:02.759
She left behind a letter
for Chairman Kang Pil-beom?

00:22:04.177 --> 00:22:05.178
What did it say?

00:22:05.262 --> 00:22:07.764
It sounds like she felt wronged
by all the pressure at work.

00:22:07.848 --> 00:22:10.475
Since the IMF crisis began,
a lot of laid-off workers

00:22:11.268 --> 00:22:12.310
have fallen into such incidents.

00:22:12.394 --> 00:22:14.604
Since the investigation is still ongoing,

00:22:14.688 --> 00:22:16.898
we had to review the contents
of the suicide notes.

00:22:37.627 --> 00:22:39.504
TO MS. HONG JANG-MI

00:22:51.057 --> 00:22:54.352
I thought long and hard about
who to ask for such a difficult favor,

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:57.898
and the only person
I could think of was you, Jang-mi.

00:22:59.983 --> 00:23:01.568
{\an8}Nine years ago,

00:23:01.651 --> 00:23:04.988
{\an8}when I was still a high school senior,
I started my first job

00:23:05.071 --> 00:23:07.032
at Cheongsan Accounting Firm.

00:23:07.115 --> 00:23:08.200
Ms. Kim, get us some coffee.

00:23:08.992 --> 00:23:09.826
Yes, sir.

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:11.786
I was thrilled to work
at such a big company,

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:13.663
but I felt
just as much pressure to do well.

00:23:14.247 --> 00:23:16.166
I found myself constantly on edge at work.

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:18.168
One day, those nerves got so bad

00:23:18.251 --> 00:23:20.420
that I spilled coffee
on an accountant's documents.

00:23:20.503 --> 00:23:21.338
I'm so sorry!

00:23:32.474 --> 00:23:34.100
I'm terribly sorry.

00:23:34.184 --> 00:23:35.310
You should apologize

00:23:35.393 --> 00:23:37.646
for interrupting my work,
not for spilling coffee.

00:23:37.729 --> 00:23:39.898
I wonder if you remember telling me that.

00:23:40.398 --> 00:23:42.192
Way to call her out.

00:23:43.193 --> 00:23:44.027
You can go.

00:23:51.076 --> 00:23:54.120
To this day, I vividly remember
how you told off my boss,

00:23:54.204 --> 00:23:57.165
who was harassing me
in the emergency stairwell.

00:23:57.666 --> 00:23:59.793
Sir, why did you ask to see me?

00:23:59.876 --> 00:24:02.295
You're free this weekend, right?

00:24:05.048 --> 00:24:06.591
Sir, as I told you last time,

00:24:06.675 --> 00:24:08.551
I'm not looking to date anyone
at the moment.

00:24:10.595 --> 00:24:11.471
Hey.

00:24:11.972 --> 00:24:15.058
Being young is nothing special.
Stop playing hard to get already.

00:24:15.141 --> 00:24:19.271
Besides, I know you're just working here
to snag yourself a decent man.

00:24:19.854 --> 00:24:22.357
- That's not true.
- Don't lie to me. Listen, Ms. Kim--

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.901
- Please don't do this.
- It's just dinner.

00:24:24.985 --> 00:24:25.986
Let me treat you to--

00:24:26.069 --> 00:24:28.363
What the…

00:24:29.739 --> 00:24:30.740
What the hell?

00:24:30.824 --> 00:24:32.450
Come on now, you know me.

00:24:32.534 --> 00:24:34.286
I'm Hong Keum-bo,
the one who calls people out.

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:38.123
Are you crazy?
Is that any way to treat your senior?

00:24:38.206 --> 00:24:40.292
If you're a senior, act your damn age.

00:24:40.375 --> 00:24:42.043
You just sent out
your wedding invitations.

00:24:42.127 --> 00:24:44.963
No decent human being would hit on
a high school girl 12 years his junior.

00:24:45.839 --> 00:24:47.882
If you ever bother her again,

00:24:47.966 --> 00:24:50.885
I will do everything in my power
to end you…

00:24:52.178 --> 00:24:54.889
both physically and socially.

00:24:54.973 --> 00:24:57.475
I can't believe this. Damn it.

00:24:59.352 --> 00:25:00.395
Are you okay?

00:25:04.024 --> 00:25:04.941
Why are you crying?

00:25:05.734 --> 00:25:07.360
Because I'm so embarrassed.

00:25:23.835 --> 00:25:26.546
She reported Hanmin for accounting fraud,

00:25:27.047 --> 00:25:29.382
but their countersuit ruined her.

00:25:29.466 --> 00:25:31.801
- How naive.
- Seriously.

00:25:33.553 --> 00:25:35.013
Wait, my wallet.

00:25:37.766 --> 00:25:39.809
I left my wallet in the office.

00:25:41.811 --> 00:25:44.356
It's past 2 p.m., so you
no longer have access to the office.

00:25:44.439 --> 00:25:45.607
Please follow the company rules.

00:25:46.483 --> 00:25:50.070
You can't ask me to follow the rules
when I don't even work here anymore.

00:25:50.153 --> 00:25:51.071
You can't go back.

00:25:51.988 --> 00:25:53.114
I said you can't!

00:26:03.583 --> 00:26:05.001
Nine years have passed,

00:26:05.085 --> 00:26:07.629
but I never stopped looking up to you.

00:26:07.712 --> 00:26:09.839
You left your wallet behind.

00:26:12.509 --> 00:26:13.385
Thank you.

00:26:15.387 --> 00:26:17.389
I couldn't be of any help to you

00:26:17.472 --> 00:26:19.808
when you were
wrongfully forced to leave the company.

00:26:19.891 --> 00:26:21.434
But this time,

00:26:21.518 --> 00:26:23.353
I was determined to protect you.

00:26:25.021 --> 00:26:25.855
Hello.

00:26:27.023 --> 00:26:27.899
Room 301?

00:26:28.733 --> 00:26:30.402
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:26:32.737 --> 00:26:33.863
I'm Room 301 too.

00:26:34.364 --> 00:26:36.324
On the day we moved into the dorms,

00:26:36.408 --> 00:26:38.326
you had a different name,

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:40.787
but I still recognized you.

00:26:42.664 --> 00:26:44.332
I was sure you had your reasons.

00:26:45.083 --> 00:26:46.835
I didn't want to interfere.

00:26:48.378 --> 00:26:51.131
Bom, do you enjoy
living with the aunties and me?

00:26:51.214 --> 00:26:52.507
Yes, I do!

00:26:54.759 --> 00:26:57.595
Bom, who's your favorite auntie?

00:26:58.596 --> 00:26:59.722
Auntie Jang-mi.

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:07.480
I like that auntie too.

00:27:10.316 --> 00:27:14.154
Thank you for welcoming Bom into your life
and taking such good care of her.

00:27:15.321 --> 00:27:16.739
One morning,

00:27:16.823 --> 00:27:20.577
Bom showed off the dollhouse
she made with you.

00:27:21.202 --> 00:27:23.955
She held up five fingers
and proudly said to me,

00:27:25.206 --> 00:27:27.834
"We are a family of five."

00:27:30.962 --> 00:27:34.716
I worked hard because I wanted to find
a place for Bom and me.

00:27:35.216 --> 00:27:37.844
I can't burden her with my debt.

00:27:39.637 --> 00:27:40.889
After I'm gone,

00:27:41.473 --> 00:27:44.100
please help her renounce her inheritance.

00:27:45.685 --> 00:27:49.814
And please tell her
that her mommy loves her very much.

00:27:52.775 --> 00:27:55.695
I hope the letter I wrote to the chairman
finds its way to him,

00:27:55.778 --> 00:27:59.032
and that he's able to rectify
the situation with the clients.

00:28:02.452 --> 00:28:05.622
Please forgive me
for making such difficult requests.

00:28:06.414 --> 00:28:07.957
But still,

00:28:08.541 --> 00:28:10.168
I'm glad I got to meet you again,

00:28:10.251 --> 00:28:11.211
Keum-bo.

00:28:25.266 --> 00:28:26.643
Mi-sook.

00:28:27.852 --> 00:28:29.270
She's still unconscious.

00:28:30.647 --> 00:28:32.023
Mi-sook…

00:28:34.359 --> 00:28:36.444
She's still unconscious. Leave her alone!

00:28:37.111 --> 00:28:39.239
Why are you yelling at me?

00:28:41.449 --> 00:28:42.617
Why am I yelling at you?

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:44.369
Mi-sook sold those funds

00:28:44.452 --> 00:28:46.704
because the head office
pressured her for sales, no?

00:28:48.206 --> 00:28:49.415
Excuse me.

00:28:49.999 --> 00:28:51.209
Can you three keep it down?

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:53.127
Sorry.

00:28:54.045 --> 00:28:56.005
That has nothing to do with Eun-joo.

00:28:56.631 --> 00:28:58.132
It most certainly does.

00:28:58.216 --> 00:28:59.717
You tell her, Kang Nora.

00:29:05.765 --> 00:29:06.724
Kang Nora?

00:29:07.892 --> 00:29:09.477
You knew, Queen Bee?

00:29:09.561 --> 00:29:10.937
Of course I did.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:14.148
I only catered to you
because of your lofty title.

00:29:14.232 --> 00:29:16.818
Mi-sook ended up like this
because of your father's orders,

00:29:16.901 --> 00:29:18.403
yet you think you're blameless?

00:29:23.575 --> 00:29:24.742
Hold on.

00:29:24.826 --> 00:29:26.494
You're Chairman Kang Pil-beom's
only daughter,

00:29:26.578 --> 00:29:27.787
Kang Nora?

00:29:29.581 --> 00:29:31.457
The three of you need to leave.

00:29:32.375 --> 00:29:33.209
Come on.

00:29:37.046 --> 00:29:40.008
Are you really Kang Nora?

00:29:40.967 --> 00:29:42.468
But I wasn't trying to hide it.

00:29:42.552 --> 00:29:44.304
You never asked who my dad was.

00:29:44.387 --> 00:29:46.264
Why are you in the company and the dorms?

00:29:46.347 --> 00:29:48.683
My dad said if I survived
the probationary period,

00:29:48.766 --> 00:29:50.894
I could have my brother's company shares.

00:29:52.478 --> 00:29:53.313
His shares?

00:29:53.396 --> 00:29:56.357
But Eun-joo really is my name,
from when I was younger.

00:29:56.441 --> 00:29:58.359
Don't get mad, Jang-mi.

00:29:58.443 --> 00:30:00.361
She's ten whole years older than you.

00:30:00.445 --> 00:30:02.697
She's even older than me. She's 35!

00:30:03.531 --> 00:30:04.991
Hey, why bring that up now?

00:30:05.074 --> 00:30:06.284
Oh my god.

00:30:06.367 --> 00:30:08.453
Hong Jang-mi, you're 35?

00:30:08.536 --> 00:30:09.954
She's not Hong Jang-mi, she's Hong…

00:30:10.914 --> 00:30:12.916
Sis, you should just come clean now too.

00:30:12.999 --> 00:30:14.292
About what?

00:30:14.375 --> 00:30:15.835
And why are you calling me that?

00:30:15.919 --> 00:30:18.546
I don't recall ever having
an embezzler as a younger sister.

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:20.131
"Embezzler"?

00:30:20.214 --> 00:30:21.799
I told you I'm not an embezzler!

00:30:21.883 --> 00:30:24.552
What about you?
Are you proud of lying your way in?

00:30:24.636 --> 00:30:27.680
If you think about it,
you're the biggest liar here.

00:30:27.764 --> 00:30:29.641
Your name, age, job, and even education!

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:32.644
I saw your graduation photo
at your parents' restaurant,

00:30:32.727 --> 00:30:33.853
proudly hanging on the wall.

00:30:34.729 --> 00:30:35.730
When I told you

00:30:36.272 --> 00:30:38.983
that it wasn't too late
for you to go to college,

00:30:39.609 --> 00:30:42.445
how pathetic I must've seemed
while you laughed at me inside!

00:30:42.528 --> 00:30:43.655
I did not.

00:30:47.408 --> 00:30:48.242
For now,

00:30:49.327 --> 00:30:51.204
you two should go back
and take care of Bom.

00:30:52.455 --> 00:30:54.457
I'll stay with Mi-sook tonight.

00:31:07.303 --> 00:31:09.138
DISCUSSION BOARD

00:31:09.222 --> 00:31:11.432
SALES PRESSURE AT HANMIN
LEAD TO THE TRAGEDY OF MS. K AT HANMIN

00:31:11.516 --> 00:31:12.558
PRESSURED TO SELL THE FUND…

00:31:12.642 --> 00:31:14.185
AFTER CRIMINAL COMPLAINTS WERE FILED…

00:31:14.268 --> 00:31:16.020
VIEW COUNT

00:31:16.104 --> 00:31:17.814
HANMIN MAGANG BRANCH
FEMALE EMPLOYEE K ATTEMPTS SUICIDE

00:31:17.897 --> 00:31:19.107
2 SUICIDE NOTES FOUND

00:31:20.858 --> 00:31:22.443
{\an8}HANMIN MAGANG BRANCH
FEMALE EMPLOYEE K ATTEMPTS SUICIDE

00:31:22.527 --> 00:31:24.070
Damn it!

00:31:25.154 --> 00:31:26.531
A suicide attempt?

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:31.411
The article seems to have been written
by a police-beat reporter

00:31:31.494 --> 00:31:34.122
who managed to overhear
details of the case at the station.

00:31:34.205 --> 00:31:36.124
Must we allow Hanmin

00:31:36.708 --> 00:31:39.002
to be mentioned
in such a disgraceful manner?

00:31:39.085 --> 00:31:40.545
What's this suicide note about?

00:31:40.628 --> 00:31:44.298
She left one addressed to you, sir,

00:31:44.382 --> 00:31:48.052
and one addressed to Hong Jang-mi,
her dormitory roommate.

00:31:49.679 --> 00:31:51.764
The officer in charge of the investigation

00:31:51.848 --> 00:31:53.057
delivered this yesterday.

00:31:53.891 --> 00:31:54.976
Let's see.

00:32:04.318 --> 00:32:07.655
I am Kim Mi-sook,
an employee at Hanmin's Magang Branch.

00:32:08.698 --> 00:32:11.659
The head office sent a directive
that raised the sales targets,

00:32:12.243 --> 00:32:14.537
and the branch
reported our sales every week.

00:32:15.121 --> 00:32:17.040
Everyone including myself at the branch

00:32:17.123 --> 00:32:20.543
worked hard to meet the sales target
set by the head office.

00:32:21.961 --> 00:32:24.088
So why is it
that only the branch employees

00:32:24.172 --> 00:32:26.382
must bear the backlash from the clients?

00:32:27.383 --> 00:32:28.217
Sir.

00:32:28.801 --> 00:32:30.678
- Your employees deserve better.
- "Your employees

00:32:30.762 --> 00:32:33.806
deserve better."

00:32:35.058 --> 00:32:38.853
"I hope the company takes the initiative

00:32:38.936 --> 00:32:41.814
to resolve this matter."

00:32:43.775 --> 00:32:44.609
Goddamn it.

00:32:51.449 --> 00:32:54.368
That extreme decision was hers alone.

00:32:55.161 --> 00:32:57.038
It has nothing to do with the company.

00:32:58.289 --> 00:33:01.751
Mr. Oh, take care of the press.

00:33:01.834 --> 00:33:03.127
Yes, sir.

00:33:03.211 --> 00:33:04.629
I want you to make sure

00:33:04.712 --> 00:33:07.465
they don't bring up our company
or the New Korea Fund.

00:33:08.132 --> 00:33:10.802
And make it clear
that if they keep writing such articles,

00:33:10.885 --> 00:33:14.180
they can forget about us
buying any more ad space.

00:33:14.263 --> 00:33:16.307
Yes, sir. I'll take care of it.

00:33:16.933 --> 00:33:19.185
Also, Ms. Song,

00:33:19.268 --> 00:33:23.022
instruct the branch managers
to shred all related official documents.

00:33:23.106 --> 00:33:25.900
And this roommate
she left that other suicide note for,

00:33:25.983 --> 00:33:29.278
make sure
she keeps her mouth shut as well.

00:33:29.779 --> 00:33:32.490
We must avoid
setting a dangerous precedent.

00:33:33.074 --> 00:33:35.076
If we console them out of pity,

00:33:35.827 --> 00:33:38.246
they'll only cling on and drag us down.

00:33:39.205 --> 00:33:40.289
Yes, sir.

00:33:41.958 --> 00:33:44.710
Besides, we must ensure
that our future partner,

00:33:45.253 --> 00:33:47.421
DK Ventures,

00:33:47.505 --> 00:33:50.007
forms a positive first impression of us.

00:33:50.716 --> 00:33:53.594
We can't let such unpleasant news
be our introduction.

00:33:54.178 --> 00:33:55.763
Don't you agree, President Shin?

00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:58.975
I don't anticipate any substantial impact.

00:33:59.058 --> 00:34:00.143
All right then.

00:34:02.019 --> 00:34:03.729
My goodness.

00:34:10.528 --> 00:34:14.031
I saw on Yeouido Pirates
that Ms. K from Magang Branch

00:34:14.115 --> 00:34:15.950
even left a suicide note
for her roommates.

00:34:17.368 --> 00:34:18.619
Have you heard anything from Ms. Hong?

00:34:18.703 --> 00:34:19.871
I haven't.

00:34:19.954 --> 00:34:20.830
I haven't either.

00:34:22.748 --> 00:34:23.791
Why not?

00:34:25.501 --> 00:34:26.544
How about this?

00:34:26.627 --> 00:34:28.546
I'll call her to a conference room
and ask her.

00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:31.215
- She came to work today.
- You're just asking for a beating.

00:34:31.716 --> 00:34:33.009
I'll bet 10,000 won on a face slap.

00:34:33.092 --> 00:34:35.720
She might use a fist, not an open hand.

00:34:35.803 --> 00:34:37.346
- A mighty punch.
- Why you…

00:34:38.472 --> 00:34:41.350
I mean, you're all curious, aren't you?

00:34:41.434 --> 00:34:43.936
You're a general manager, so act like one.

00:34:44.729 --> 00:34:47.231
Did you hear anything
about how the company will respond?

00:34:47.315 --> 00:34:49.650
I'm sure they'll clamp down on all fronts.

00:34:49.734 --> 00:34:50.610
Quietly, that is.

00:35:00.328 --> 00:35:01.162
Hong Jang-mi.

00:35:01.871 --> 00:35:03.664
Are you going to see Ms. Song too?

00:35:04.916 --> 00:35:06.500
I'm sure it'll be about Mi-sook.

00:35:11.214 --> 00:35:13.591
I hear you're roommates
with Ms. Kim Mi-sook.

00:35:15.593 --> 00:35:16.719
Yes, that's right.

00:35:17.929 --> 00:35:19.972
Did you write that post
on Yeouido Pirates, Ms. Go?

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:21.724
No, ma'am.

00:35:21.807 --> 00:35:23.684
I would never, ma'am.

00:35:25.436 --> 00:35:26.395
Was it you, Ms. Hong?

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:30.733
It wasn't you.

00:35:30.816 --> 00:35:33.402
Did you call us in
to find out who leaked it?

00:35:34.528 --> 00:35:36.113
Kim Mi-sook is an orphan.

00:35:36.197 --> 00:35:39.951
If anyone were to leak it,
it would be the suicide note recipient

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:43.079
or her roommate in the dorms.

00:35:43.996 --> 00:35:46.666
Hong Jang-mi,
she wrote you a note, didn't she?

00:35:48.167 --> 00:35:49.710
Ms. Kim Mi-sook's suicide attempt

00:35:49.794 --> 00:35:52.255
is undeniably the result
of work-related stress.

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:55.591
Shouldn't you ask about
how she's doing first?

00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:58.386
How can the head office, the branch,

00:35:58.469 --> 00:36:01.013
and even the OW Club
that the victim admired,

00:36:01.097 --> 00:36:03.599
all just erase her
and pretend as if nothing happened

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:05.810
to prioritize damage control?

00:36:06.435 --> 00:36:07.853
If, in any case, she'd died--

00:36:07.937 --> 00:36:09.230
But she didn't die.

00:36:11.524 --> 00:36:13.401
What's with this fuss
when she's still alive?

00:36:16.696 --> 00:36:18.322
Just hand over the suicide note.

00:36:30.126 --> 00:36:33.254
Those are the criminal complaints
filed against Hanmin's Ms. Kim Mi-sook

00:36:33.337 --> 00:36:36.882
that demand compensatory damages
for the New Korea Funds she sold.

00:36:37.758 --> 00:36:39.760
Will the company deal with the lawsuits?

00:36:39.844 --> 00:36:41.929
Otherwise, at least help
with her hospital bills.

00:36:43.889 --> 00:36:45.474
You have some nerve.

00:36:45.558 --> 00:36:48.477
Let me apologize on her behalf, ma'am.
I'll have a talk with her.

00:36:48.561 --> 00:36:50.354
She's just in a state of shock right now.

00:36:58.112 --> 00:37:00.031
{\an8}HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

00:37:17.465 --> 00:37:18.799
Hey, Ms. Hong.

00:37:19.425 --> 00:37:23.054
You're roommates with Kim Mi-sook
from the Magang Branch, right?

00:37:24.013 --> 00:37:24.847
Yes.

00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:25.765
Come on.

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:27.892
I heard she left

00:37:28.559 --> 00:37:30.311
a suicide note for the roommates.

00:37:30.394 --> 00:37:32.396
Did you read it? What did it say?

00:37:33.022 --> 00:37:36.442
I heard she addressed the complaints
about the company to the chairman.

00:37:37.693 --> 00:37:39.528
She must've written
something else to her friends.

00:37:39.612 --> 00:37:41.072
What's it to you?

00:37:41.155 --> 00:37:42.448
I'm just curious.

00:37:44.658 --> 00:37:47.328
- Let us in on the gossip.
- Mr. Cha.

00:37:47.411 --> 00:37:49.455
What's wrong with you?

00:37:49.538 --> 00:37:50.831
If the job was killing her,

00:37:51.499 --> 00:37:52.792
she could've just quit.

00:37:52.875 --> 00:37:54.668
Why attempt suicide?

00:37:58.214 --> 00:37:59.215
Asshole!

00:38:08.057 --> 00:38:09.392
What? "Asshole"?

00:38:09.475 --> 00:38:10.393
Come here.

00:38:11.102 --> 00:38:12.478
I can't believe this.

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:16.482
There's big trouble. Come out now!

00:38:18.192 --> 00:38:19.360
What did you say?

00:38:20.236 --> 00:38:21.737
Unbelievable.

00:38:22.988 --> 00:38:24.573
- "Asshole"?
- Yes! Asshole!

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:27.993
Do I look like a peer to you?

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:31.247
If we were peers,
you wouldn't be standing.

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:33.082
You'd already be crushed under my feet!

00:38:33.165 --> 00:38:34.750
Goddamn.

00:38:35.835 --> 00:38:38.129
Can you believe this?

00:38:39.004 --> 00:38:40.172
Listen.

00:38:40.256 --> 00:38:41.424
You and I?

00:38:42.383 --> 00:38:44.510
When it comes to rank, age, and gender,

00:38:44.593 --> 00:38:47.263
you're nowhere near my level
in any respect!

00:38:48.764 --> 00:38:51.267
Why you little… You damn brat!

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:00.359
Asshole.

00:39:00.443 --> 00:39:01.360
What?

00:39:01.444 --> 00:39:02.945
When someone younger criticizes you,

00:39:03.028 --> 00:39:06.782
that should be a sign to reflect
on the poor choices you've made.

00:39:08.701 --> 00:39:10.035
Ms. Hong, please try to calm down.

00:39:10.119 --> 00:39:11.704
Don't touch me!

00:39:14.915 --> 00:39:17.585
If you ever run that mouth
about Mi-sook again,

00:39:19.462 --> 00:39:20.754
I will end you.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.091
Damn it.

00:39:26.093 --> 00:39:28.095
Damn it. Come here.

00:39:28.179 --> 00:39:29.555
Hey, Hong Jang-mi!

00:39:30.848 --> 00:39:32.391
- Why that little…
- Unbelievable.

00:39:32.475 --> 00:39:33.350
Ms. Hong!

00:39:35.686 --> 00:39:36.687
Go.

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:39.064
Hey!

00:39:40.733 --> 00:39:42.318
Hong Jang-mi!

00:39:42.401 --> 00:39:43.986
Your days are numbered here!

00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:45.112
Stop it.

00:39:45.196 --> 00:39:46.655
I'll make sure of it!

00:39:49.575 --> 00:39:51.827
- You're so loud.
- You went too far.

00:39:52.328 --> 00:39:54.371
What are you staring at? Damn it.

00:39:55.247 --> 00:39:56.540
It hurts.

00:39:56.624 --> 00:39:57.458
Get back to work!

00:39:57.541 --> 00:40:00.211
He's so goddamn embarrassing.

00:40:00.961 --> 00:40:02.254
Where did Mr. So go?

00:40:02.338 --> 00:40:04.381
He's probably upset
because he's menopausal.

00:40:08.636 --> 00:40:09.678
It's okay.

00:40:09.762 --> 00:40:11.889
Take the next three days off,
starting today.

00:40:14.433 --> 00:40:15.518
You'll leave immediately.

00:40:18.062 --> 00:40:19.146
I apologize for causing…

00:40:20.606 --> 00:40:21.607
such a commotion.

00:40:22.608 --> 00:40:23.567
Thank you…

00:40:24.985 --> 00:40:25.819
for holding back.

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:31.242
If you had actually hit him…

00:40:32.326 --> 00:40:33.452
Right, you did.

00:40:34.203 --> 00:40:35.871
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

00:40:35.955 --> 00:40:39.542
I might not look it,
but I'm still a division manager.

00:40:45.089 --> 00:40:46.632
{\an8}LETTER OF RESIGNATION

00:40:48.175 --> 00:40:49.510
It's my resignation letter.

00:41:05.025 --> 00:41:07.570
Why are you following me?
Go and look after Bom.

00:41:08.112 --> 00:41:09.280
I have something to ask you.

00:41:09.363 --> 00:41:12.074
When did you find out that I was Nora?

00:41:12.157 --> 00:41:13.617
Since you joined the company.

00:41:13.701 --> 00:41:16.161
Ms. Song ordered me to monitor you.

00:41:16.245 --> 00:41:17.371
Ms. Song did?

00:41:18.122 --> 00:41:19.999
And you agreed to do it, Queen Bee?

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.001
It was an order.

00:41:22.084 --> 00:41:24.753
Besides, why am I still "Queen Bee"?

00:41:24.837 --> 00:41:25.838
Hong Jang-mi…

00:41:25.921 --> 00:41:27.131
No, Hong Keum…

00:41:27.715 --> 00:41:29.758
Whatever her name is, she's Queen Bee now.

00:41:30.384 --> 00:41:31.260
Nora.

00:41:43.355 --> 00:41:44.648
Ms. Go, right?

00:41:45.858 --> 00:41:47.776
I've heard a lot about you from Ms. Song.

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:49.361
Yes, ma'am.

00:41:50.404 --> 00:41:51.864
Nora, let's go home now.

00:41:52.865 --> 00:41:53.699
Home?

00:41:53.782 --> 00:41:54.825
But this is my home.

00:41:54.908 --> 00:41:56.118
What are you talking about?

00:41:56.201 --> 00:41:58.037
I told you earlier.

00:41:58.120 --> 00:41:59.455
You're moving into Dad's place.

00:42:00.039 --> 00:42:01.582
I can't today.

00:42:03.167 --> 00:42:05.878
Someone is waiting for me inside.

00:42:05.961 --> 00:42:09.089
We can have the housekeeper come by
to pick up your stuff.

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:10.799
Wait, no.

00:42:10.883 --> 00:42:13.052
You can pack Nora's stuff
and send it over, right?

00:42:14.845 --> 00:42:16.263
Sure, ma'am.

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:18.015
Thank you.

00:42:18.098 --> 00:42:19.099
Let's go.

00:42:19.642 --> 00:42:21.185
It's so cold today.

00:42:25.064 --> 00:42:25.898
Go on.

00:42:34.948 --> 00:42:35.866
Damn it.

00:42:46.835 --> 00:42:48.337
Why does she have so many clothes?

00:42:54.426 --> 00:42:56.345
Those are Auntie Eun-joo's.

00:42:57.096 --> 00:42:59.640
She went home. She's not coming back.

00:42:59.723 --> 00:43:01.141
Then,

00:43:01.642 --> 00:43:04.186
did Auntie Jang-mi go home too?

00:43:07.564 --> 00:43:08.440
No.

00:43:08.524 --> 00:43:10.484
She's with your mom.

00:43:19.284 --> 00:43:22.371
Starting tonight,
you can sleep with me in the big room.

00:43:25.708 --> 00:43:28.293
Where's Mommy?

00:43:57.865 --> 00:43:58.991
Bom.

00:44:17.342 --> 00:44:18.927
Why did you bring her here?

00:44:19.011 --> 00:44:20.220
What did you tell her?

00:44:20.304 --> 00:44:21.638
I told her it was an accident.

00:44:22.181 --> 00:44:24.475
She deserves to know where her mom is.

00:44:25.476 --> 00:44:28.437
We can't just leave her alone
in the dorms for the night.

00:44:29.146 --> 00:44:30.647
Why would she be alone? Where's Nora?

00:44:30.731 --> 00:44:32.441
She left with her mom earlier.

00:44:32.524 --> 00:44:34.443
She left for good.

00:44:37.654 --> 00:44:39.114
I've thought about it all day.

00:44:40.032 --> 00:44:42.576
Let me see the rest of Mi-sook's letter.

00:44:42.659 --> 00:44:43.994
I need to read it for myself.

00:45:29.206 --> 00:45:32.251
Have you ever prayed for someone
other than yourself?

00:45:34.503 --> 00:45:37.256
I didn't recognize her when we met again,

00:45:38.966 --> 00:45:42.052
and I'm still not sure
I know what kind of person Mi-sook is.

00:45:46.098 --> 00:45:46.932
But…

00:45:50.102 --> 00:45:51.103
I do remember…

00:45:53.855 --> 00:45:57.067
that she prayed for me, for us.

00:45:58.443 --> 00:46:00.821
Why couldn't she just think about herself?

00:46:05.993 --> 00:46:06.868
If…

00:46:09.204 --> 00:46:10.831
If I had told her

00:46:12.249 --> 00:46:14.459
that it wasn't her fault that night,

00:46:15.919 --> 00:46:17.462
would she have been okay now?

00:46:22.384 --> 00:46:24.553
You thought you got away with it
because you were clever, huh?

00:46:25.387 --> 00:46:26.597
We let you get away with it.

00:46:27.222 --> 00:46:29.016
I let you get away with it,
and so did Mi-sook.

00:46:30.601 --> 00:46:33.228
I let you because I felt bad
that Go Bok-cheol attacked you,

00:46:34.563 --> 00:46:37.482
but Mi-sook let you because
she's just too nice for her own good!

00:46:39.735 --> 00:46:41.737
Poor Mi-sook…

00:46:52.539 --> 00:46:53.373
Bom.

00:46:57.169 --> 00:46:58.003
Bom…

00:46:59.921 --> 00:47:01.506
What are we going to do?

00:47:06.928 --> 00:47:07.763
Bom…

00:47:13.977 --> 00:47:17.189
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

00:47:20.442 --> 00:47:21.360
Hey.

00:47:25.113 --> 00:47:26.239
Thank you for making the trip.

00:47:26.323 --> 00:47:27.574
I'm exhausted.

00:47:27.658 --> 00:47:29.743
Did you enjoy the meal we prepared?

00:47:29.826 --> 00:47:31.662
- It was delicious.
- I'm glad.

00:47:31.745 --> 00:47:33.580
Nice to meet you. I'm Oh Deok-gyu.

00:47:33.664 --> 00:47:35.791
- Yes, hello. I'm--
- Let's talk inside.

00:47:36.625 --> 00:47:37.542
Sure.

00:47:43.924 --> 00:47:45.342
{\an8}It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:47:45.425 --> 00:47:47.511
I'm D.K. Lee of DK Ventures.

00:47:48.762 --> 00:47:50.597
I am Kang Pil-beom.

00:47:52.891 --> 00:47:54.685
Please take a seat.

00:47:55.769 --> 00:47:56.853
Let's sit.

00:47:59.856 --> 00:48:03.068
Should we get right to it then?

00:48:03.151 --> 00:48:04.111
Sir.

00:48:04.194 --> 00:48:07.489
DK Ventures wishes to dispatch
an investment due diligence team here

00:48:07.572 --> 00:48:09.950
to the head office next week.

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:12.494
Before that,
I'd like to sort out a few things first.

00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:17.416
We heard Hanmin is in urgent need of
300 billion won in operating funds.

00:48:17.999 --> 00:48:21.920
Based on the financial statements,
some members of our board are concerned

00:48:22.754 --> 00:48:24.506
about Hanmin's management soundness.

00:48:25.465 --> 00:48:28.301
So we'd like management control
along with a portion of the equity.

00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:32.472
Management control as well?

00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:35.016
It'll benefit both parties.

00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:36.351
That's not what worries me.

00:48:36.435 --> 00:48:39.563
My concern is that you'll be asking
for the whole company next.

00:48:40.772 --> 00:48:45.110
How about using
the head office building as collateral?

00:48:45.193 --> 00:48:48.780
Our company does hold
a considerable amount of real estate,

00:48:48.864 --> 00:48:50.323
both in land and buildings.

00:48:50.824 --> 00:48:52.743
Having a mortgage against our real estate

00:48:53.577 --> 00:48:55.662
could negatively affect
the company's public image.

00:49:02.461 --> 00:49:04.755
My goodness…

00:49:07.174 --> 00:49:12.262
What if Hanmin issues bonds
that DK Ventures could purchase directly?

00:49:14.389 --> 00:49:15.891
If public funds are reinjected,

00:49:15.974 --> 00:49:17.809
maintaining a domestically owned image

00:49:17.893 --> 00:49:20.771
while avoiding the appearance
of overseas backing

00:49:20.854 --> 00:49:22.439
could work in our favor.

00:49:26.526 --> 00:49:28.445
Would you consider that?

00:49:28.528 --> 00:49:31.573
I believe DK Ventures' payout

00:49:32.157 --> 00:49:34.618
would certainly be ensured with that idea.

00:49:36.286 --> 00:49:37.454
Okay.

00:49:37.537 --> 00:49:38.663
It's not a bad deal.

00:49:39.748 --> 00:49:40.874
And one more thing.

00:49:40.957 --> 00:49:44.419
An organization must be lightweight
for efficient management,

00:49:45.128 --> 00:49:48.840
but Hanmin is weighed down
by too much dead weight at the moment.

00:49:51.551 --> 00:49:54.221
We'd like to request
aggressive cuts in labor costs.

00:49:55.305 --> 00:49:56.181
You know,

00:49:56.932 --> 00:49:57.849
a diet.

00:50:00.977 --> 00:50:04.147
Cutting costs
will help balance our profit and loss.

00:50:06.107 --> 00:50:08.109
Yes. I understand.

00:50:09.277 --> 00:50:12.864
After all, a good presentation
goes a long way.

00:50:17.244 --> 00:50:18.954
I knew Chairman Kang would say that.

00:50:19.496 --> 00:50:21.248
He's stingy with his own,

00:50:21.832 --> 00:50:24.167
but happy to rack up debt
with other people's money.

00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:28.797
He'll issue short-term bonds
with a one-year maturity,

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:31.508
then ask to extend the repayment period
by another year or two.

00:50:32.092 --> 00:50:35.136
In the meantime,
we'll quietly accumulate more bonds.

00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:37.889
And if Hanmin goes bankrupt on its own?
That's a win for us.

00:50:38.807 --> 00:50:39.641
What if,

00:50:40.767 --> 00:50:42.143
in the worst-case scenario,

00:50:42.978 --> 00:50:45.230
Hanmin Investment & Securities
goes bankrupt?

00:50:45.313 --> 00:50:47.190
We can file
for a court-mediated debt workout

00:50:47.274 --> 00:50:49.526
and request an extension
of the repayment period.

00:50:49.609 --> 00:50:52.195
Meanwhile, your management control
would be protected.

00:50:53.613 --> 00:50:54.739
If he continues to hold out,

00:50:54.823 --> 00:50:58.368
we'll take over Hanmin
with a surprise court receivership filing

00:50:58.451 --> 00:51:00.412
and spruce it up to sell it.

00:51:00.996 --> 00:51:04.249
Then all of Yeouido
will be in the palm of our hands.

00:51:08.378 --> 00:51:11.673
The 15th presidential election
is coming up.

00:51:12.883 --> 00:51:15.468
They say the nation is in crisis,

00:51:15.552 --> 00:51:19.973
but whoever becomes the next president
will have to stimulate the economy.

00:51:20.056 --> 00:51:23.226
The IMF crisis
will last four years at most.

00:51:23.727 --> 00:51:25.645
Even if all the other companies crumble,

00:51:25.729 --> 00:51:28.899
we just need to hold out until then.

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:32.986
At the end of the day,
they would never dare

00:51:33.069 --> 00:51:36.239
to go after Hanmin
with just 300 billion won.

00:51:37.532 --> 00:51:38.575
That's right.

00:51:40.577 --> 00:51:41.953
All right then.

00:51:45.707 --> 00:51:46.750
Restructuring?

00:51:46.833 --> 00:51:49.920
Dad, there are only four of us
in Risk Management, including me.

00:51:50.003 --> 00:51:51.713
It makes it that much easier.

00:51:51.796 --> 00:51:53.340
Save yourself and Bang Jin-mok,

00:51:53.965 --> 00:51:55.592
and get rid of the other two.

00:51:55.675 --> 00:51:57.719
I can't do that. I don't want to.

00:51:57.802 --> 00:51:59.471
You know, I realized today

00:51:59.554 --> 00:52:02.641
that we need to be closer
to President Shin.

00:52:02.724 --> 00:52:04.476
As opinion leaders of this company,

00:52:04.559 --> 00:52:06.353
we need to expand our global network.

00:52:06.436 --> 00:52:08.229
Knock yourself out being global.

00:52:09.064 --> 00:52:10.273
I don't want to.

00:52:10.857 --> 00:52:11.816
You punk.

00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:14.819
This is important stuff,
so at least pretend to listen.

00:52:14.903 --> 00:52:15.737
Hey!

00:52:24.663 --> 00:52:26.289
A 40% staff reduction?

00:52:26.957 --> 00:52:29.542
The president summoned
all the general managers

00:52:29.626 --> 00:52:32.587
and told us we had to
reduce our teams by 40 percent.

00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:36.257
That overseas investor
who's lending the money

00:52:36.341 --> 00:52:38.093
is strongly demanding it,

00:52:38.718 --> 00:52:40.053
so there's no other choice.

00:52:40.637 --> 00:52:42.681
Was that why Big Al was called in?

00:52:42.764 --> 00:52:43.932
Probably.

00:52:44.015 --> 00:52:47.602
I heard the division heads
have to decide and submit a layoff list.

00:52:49.062 --> 00:52:52.482
And I guess Ms. Hong
may have heard about it sooner.

00:52:53.525 --> 00:52:55.110
She already handed in her resignation.

00:52:55.902 --> 00:52:57.737
That's the best news I've heard all day.

00:52:57.821 --> 00:52:59.072
You're a general manager, so--

00:52:59.155 --> 00:53:00.699
Right, so act like one?

00:53:00.782 --> 00:53:01.616
Yeah.

00:53:16.965 --> 00:53:18.675
{\an8}GENERAL MANAGER CHA JUNG-IL

WORKFORCE REDUCTION LIST: TRADING DIVISION

00:54:29.162 --> 00:54:31.956
An employee with 25 years of service
came to say farewell,

00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:33.792
and they have him waiting for three hours?

00:55:30.431 --> 00:55:31.599
The chairman said

00:55:32.642 --> 00:55:35.186
there is no need for you
to submit your resignation letter.

00:55:35.979 --> 00:55:39.107
Today will be
your last day of work, Mr. So.

00:55:41.234 --> 00:55:45.738
There's something I'd like to say
to the chairman before I go.

00:55:46.322 --> 00:55:47.365
You should just go.

00:55:48.867 --> 00:55:49.701
You know how he is.

00:56:38.208 --> 00:56:39.709
Mr. Cha,

00:56:40.251 --> 00:56:43.504
why don't you finish up
Trading's restructuring list

00:56:43.588 --> 00:56:44.923
for me as well?

00:56:46.841 --> 00:56:47.675
Yes, sir.

00:56:47.759 --> 00:56:49.677
I'll see to it immediately
and report back.

00:56:49.761 --> 00:56:50.678
All right.

TO BE CONSOLIDATED WITH TRADING DIVISION

00:57:27.966 --> 00:57:29.551
Risk Management is being dissolved?

00:57:30.176 --> 00:57:31.177
Then where do I go?

00:57:31.261 --> 00:57:32.470
ALBERT OH
LEE YONG-GI

00:57:32.554 --> 00:57:34.639
Big Al, you're the head of Trading now.

00:57:34.722 --> 00:57:36.057
What am I supposed to do there?

00:57:37.016 --> 00:57:37.850
No clue.

00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:39.852
What am I supposed to do in IT?

00:57:39.936 --> 00:57:42.355
Why am I not on the layoff list?

00:57:43.731 --> 00:57:46.442
"Pending reassignment
for all entry-level female employees"?

00:57:51.239 --> 00:57:52.574
BANG JIN-MOK

00:58:03.167 --> 00:58:06.588
ENDURE, EVEN SUFFERING CAN BE BEAUTIFUL.
WHEN HARDSHIP STRIKES, TRY SMILING.

00:58:06.671 --> 00:58:10.049
Are you certain about letting go of
Mr. Bang Jin-mok and Mr. So Gyeong-dong

00:58:10.133 --> 00:58:11.384
at this time?

00:58:11.467 --> 00:58:13.845
It would've been another headache

00:58:13.928 --> 00:58:15.597
if they'd refused to leave.

00:58:16.389 --> 00:58:18.725
We might as well cut them loose now.

00:58:19.475 --> 00:58:22.145
There will always be
younger and smarter new hires.

00:58:32.488 --> 00:58:34.365
How could they get rid of Risk Management

00:58:34.449 --> 00:58:36.367
when we're in the middle of
the IMF crisis?

00:58:37.368 --> 00:58:40.079
And why is Mr. Bang on the layoff list?

00:58:40.163 --> 00:58:41.247
I told you I was quitting.

00:58:42.206 --> 00:58:44.000
Mr. Bang made me.

00:58:44.083 --> 00:58:47.003
He made me write my name down
because I'll never get fired,

00:58:47.086 --> 00:58:50.673
and then his own name
since the company's wanted him long gone.

00:58:51.257 --> 00:58:52.342
Then three would survive.

00:58:55.178 --> 00:58:58.181
I've been wanting to leave Hanmin
for a while now.

00:58:58.681 --> 00:59:00.141
If I get forced out,

00:59:01.809 --> 00:59:03.394
it'd only leave regrets, right?

00:59:04.312 --> 00:59:06.648
Then for your farewell party,

00:59:06.731 --> 00:59:08.107
we should go to your favorite--

00:59:08.191 --> 00:59:09.025
Forget it.

00:59:10.443 --> 00:59:11.986
Let me go home sober for once.

00:59:22.955 --> 00:59:24.624
I didn't want to put
your name down anyway.

00:59:26.209 --> 00:59:27.877
We still have work to do.

00:59:38.054 --> 00:59:43.893
{\an8}HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

00:59:46.646 --> 00:59:49.273
Gosh, Yeouido…

00:59:54.153 --> 00:59:56.447
What a nasty, unbearable place it's been.

00:59:59.534 --> 01:00:00.368
What are you doing?

01:00:01.911 --> 01:00:03.621
All right. Jeez.

01:00:04.288 --> 01:00:05.164
It's okay.

01:00:07.083 --> 01:00:07.917
It's…

01:00:08.876 --> 01:00:11.170
All right now.

01:00:12.505 --> 01:00:13.423
You did well.

01:00:14.173 --> 01:00:15.007
Good work.

01:00:19.762 --> 01:00:21.097
Let's part ways here.

01:00:21.681 --> 01:00:22.515
That's it.

01:00:23.057 --> 01:00:24.726
At least say a few parting words.

01:00:36.237 --> 01:00:37.238
Good luck.

01:00:42.368 --> 01:00:43.244
Show respect to your senior.

01:00:45.163 --> 01:00:46.289
Senior?

01:00:51.919 --> 01:00:52.795
I'm off.

01:00:55.214 --> 01:00:56.048
Get home safe.

01:01:29.874 --> 01:01:30.833
Watch the steps.

01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:36.839
Watch the steps.

01:01:40.843 --> 01:01:42.845
Are they moving out of the dorms?

01:01:43.346 --> 01:01:44.847
They've been laid off,

01:01:45.723 --> 01:01:47.892
so they can no longer stay
in the workers' dormitory.

01:01:49.101 --> 01:01:51.646
Many of them go back home
to the countryside.

01:02:32.103 --> 01:02:33.479
Bom, wake up.

01:02:35.481 --> 01:02:38.276
Let's get changed
and sleep with me in the big room.

Yehppee!

01:03:55.436 --> 01:03:56.896
Yehppee and I

01:03:56.979 --> 01:03:59.398
are getting the ledger together
for whistleblowing purposes.

01:03:59.982 --> 01:04:01.359
You can pick up the slush fund ledger

01:04:01.442 --> 01:04:05.196
at the president's office
on the 12th floor in Hanmin's head office.

- This can't be.

01:04:09.951 --> 01:04:11.994
I'll find Yehppee within three months

01:04:12.078 --> 01:04:14.580
and retrieve the slush fund ledger.

01:04:14.664 --> 01:04:15.581
What?

01:04:15.665 --> 01:04:17.875
You already know, Yehppee.

01:04:17.959 --> 01:04:20.461
You have a copy
of the slush fund ledger, don't you?

01:04:21.045 --> 01:04:21.879
No.

01:04:22.838 --> 01:04:23.839
Where's that notebook?

01:04:23.923 --> 01:04:25.132
The notebook with the sticker.

01:04:25.841 --> 01:04:27.426
Sir, have you seen a notebook this big?

01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:29.762
There's a dog sticker
in the bottom-right corner.

01:04:29.845 --> 01:04:31.597
I burned it all up already.

01:04:32.723 --> 01:04:34.016
See? It's all gone.

01:04:38.521 --> 01:04:40.106
Yehppee!

01:05:10.928 --> 01:05:12.847
That's an obscene amount of money.

01:05:13.639 --> 01:05:15.391
It's three times what we estimated.

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:25.735
Director Yun, I found it.

01:05:26.402 --> 01:05:27.570
The slush fund ledger.

01:05:40.833 --> 01:05:41.959
Pardon me.

01:05:43.461 --> 01:05:44.837
It's all right.

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:46.797
Oh no.

01:05:46.881 --> 01:05:48.257
I hope it's okay.

01:05:48.924 --> 01:05:49.925
It should be fine.

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:52.803
It's fine. You can go.

01:05:52.887 --> 01:05:53.721
Bye.

01:06:01.896 --> 01:06:04.440
The higher-ups have no desire
to investigate the slush fund.

01:06:05.649 --> 01:06:06.567
They're adamant.

01:06:07.818 --> 01:06:09.779
With the economy in crisis,

01:06:09.862 --> 01:06:12.239
they can't afford to go after
the executives' corruption.

01:06:12.323 --> 01:06:15.701
That's just an excuse
because they're scared.

01:06:16.994 --> 01:06:19.121
If it's a national and corporate crisis,

01:06:19.789 --> 01:06:21.791
the decision-makers
should take responsibility.

01:06:21.874 --> 01:06:25.586
Why are the loyal, hard-working people
losing their jobs and suffering for it?

01:06:36.097 --> 01:06:36.972
Damn it.

01:07:15.469 --> 01:07:16.679
I wanted to see

01:07:17.221 --> 01:07:20.307
if you were someone
who could be entrusted with a life…

01:07:21.475 --> 01:07:23.727
for myself.

01:07:23.811 --> 01:07:25.688
I'm talking about Hanmin's.

01:07:27.189 --> 01:07:30.401
If we go bankrupt, thousands
of employees will be out on the streets.

01:07:30.484 --> 01:07:31.986
Is that the justice you seek?

01:07:32.069 --> 01:07:34.864
Why haven't you gotten anywhere,
while I've come this far?

01:07:34.947 --> 01:07:38.033
I want to do well with this
so I can get a permanent spot next year.

01:07:38.117 --> 01:07:39.994
Here's a pick-me-up treat for you.

01:07:40.077 --> 01:07:42.663
I am Kim Mi-sook
from Hanmin's Magang Branch.

01:07:56.635 --> 01:07:58.721
KIM MI-SOOK
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

01:08:09.732 --> 01:08:12.234
{\an8}MOYUN HOSPITAL

01:08:24.788 --> 01:08:25.956
Let's talk outside.

01:08:26.999 --> 01:08:27.875
Your outfit…

01:08:28.751 --> 01:08:29.585
Are you going somewhere?

01:08:30.544 --> 01:08:33.047
Today's the day I return to the FSS.

01:08:42.514 --> 01:08:44.016
You saw the ledger, so you know.

01:08:44.558 --> 01:08:46.268
It's well over 300 billion won.

01:08:46.810 --> 01:08:49.396
If Chairman Kang had used that slush fund,

01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:52.441
the foreign funding from DK Ventures

01:08:52.524 --> 01:08:54.235
and the restructuring
could've been avoided.

01:08:54.318 --> 01:08:56.153
Yes, exactly.

01:08:56.237 --> 01:08:58.280
I know you think I'm just some vile thief,

01:08:58.364 --> 01:09:01.825
but compared to Chairman Kang,
I'm just a petty crook scraping by.

01:09:02.409 --> 01:09:03.911
You know what's more infuriating?

01:09:03.994 --> 01:09:06.664
Even if this country and Hanmin go under,

01:09:06.747 --> 01:09:08.791
Chairman Kang's family
will remain unscathed.

01:09:10.501 --> 01:09:13.712
The ledger being burned
was the will of the heavens,

01:09:13.796 --> 01:09:16.423
so goodbye to you too, Ms. Hong Keum-bo.

01:09:17.841 --> 01:09:18.842
What if it didn't burn?

01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:28.852
By the will of the heavens,
it ended up in my hands.

01:09:31.772 --> 01:09:33.107
Not a chance, Queen Bee.

01:09:35.025 --> 01:09:37.194
You'll be laden with honors
if you return with that.

01:09:37.861 --> 01:09:38.988
No.

01:09:39.071 --> 01:09:40.239
I'm going to steal it all.

01:09:41.407 --> 01:09:42.324
Are you in?

01:10:26.952 --> 01:10:28.787
{\an8}UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

01:10:30.039 --> 01:10:32.207
{\an8}- Goodbye now.
- This country's economy is in peril.

01:10:32.291 --> 01:10:34.835
{\an8}Nobody cares about
a chairman embezzling money.

01:10:34.918 --> 01:10:36.712
{\an8}They're not going to pursue it!

01:10:36.795 --> 01:10:39.298
{\an8}I'm thinking about securing a position
for Ms. Kang at the company.

01:10:40.174 --> 01:10:41.383
{\an8}The lowest score on the written exam?

01:10:41.467 --> 01:10:42.843
{\an8}It's you? Ma'am?

01:10:42.926 --> 01:10:45.012
{\an8}Director Yun told you to return
on December 8th.

01:10:45.095 --> 01:10:46.805
{\an8}Why are you still here?

01:10:47.723 --> 01:10:50.017
{\an8}She's just being stubborn right now!

01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:51.894
{\an8}Steal 300 billion won and then what?

01:10:51.977 --> 01:10:53.437
{\an8}I'm not done yet.

01:10:54.188 --> 01:10:55.189
{\an8}Is it just me,

01:10:55.689 --> 01:10:58.275
{\an8}or do you seem
particularly interested in Hong Jang-mi?

01:10:59.526 --> 01:11:04.531
