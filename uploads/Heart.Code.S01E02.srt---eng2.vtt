I became a police.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:13.505
To uphold justice.

00:00:14.385 --> 00:00:15.465
Knowing that

00:00:15.575 --> 00:00:17.785
it’s a deadly risk to get close.

00:00:17.914 --> 00:00:19.025
But I’m not afraid.

00:00:19.145 --> 00:00:20.825
I will unmask him.

00:00:20.905 --> 00:00:23.105
And I will make him pay for what he did.

00:00:23.692 --> 00:00:25.145
Special training session.

00:00:25.618 --> 00:00:26.997
I want you to join it.

00:00:27.378 --> 00:00:28.545
What kind of VIP is this?

00:00:28.652 --> 00:00:31.305
The training is for important people only.

00:00:32.135 --> 00:00:33.705
I want to be sure.

00:00:33.778 --> 00:00:35.594
That you’ll be somewhere safe.

00:01:20.628 --> 00:01:21.865
Oh, shit.

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.705
I'm here.

00:03:20.012 --> 00:03:21.665
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:03:21.803 --> 00:03:23.185
So sorry.

00:03:23.354 --> 00:03:23.905
Ah.

00:03:23.985 --> 00:03:25.505
I'm Bhavika Ratchanon.

00:03:25.588 --> 00:03:26.865
You can sign right here.

00:03:29.268 --> 00:03:29.865
Hey.

00:03:30.185 --> 00:03:30.985
Do you know each other?

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.280
She’s the bakery owner you’re so obsessed with.

00:03:35.345 --> 00:03:35.981
Huh?

00:03:37.071 --> 00:03:37.705
So.

00:03:37.797 --> 00:03:39.145
How did she become a police?

00:03:40.461 --> 00:03:41.385
Right?

00:03:44.665 --> 00:03:45.785
Everything's set.

00:03:47.391 --> 00:03:50.425
Since we are well past our departure time.

00:03:51.225 --> 00:03:53.905
I'd like to ask all trainees.

00:03:54.191 --> 00:03:55.225
To board the bus.

00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:57.065
And be seated properly.

00:03:57.631 --> 00:03:59.305
Within three minutes.

00:04:00.818 --> 00:04:01.785
Hey, Tarn.

00:04:01.865 --> 00:04:03.305
I'll be splitting off with the medical team.

00:04:03.345 --> 00:04:05.083
-Okay, see you.
-Ok, see you.

00:04:08.252 --> 00:04:09.225
What is this?

00:04:10.221 --> 00:04:11.505
A survival kit?

00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:12.357
Yes.

00:04:13.157 --> 00:04:14.065
Cool.

00:04:14.455 --> 00:04:15.305
Thank you.

00:04:15.612 --> 00:04:16.545
As for that bag.

00:04:16.585 --> 00:04:18.065
And your car.

00:04:28.905 --> 00:04:29.505
Oh.

00:04:29.612 --> 00:04:30.265
You.

00:04:30.991 --> 00:04:33.465
Just leave your bag here and
call someone from home to pick it up.

00:04:33.803 --> 00:04:34.985
Oh, I definitely can't do that.

00:04:35.065 --> 00:04:36.225
Everything in here is essential.

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:37.545
You two over there.

00:04:38.886 --> 00:04:39.985
If you aren't ready to train,

00:04:40.609 --> 00:04:41.945
you are free to leave.

00:04:42.621 --> 00:04:43.545
We're ready.

00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:45.425
We're definitely going to get it.

00:04:50.357 --> 00:04:51.505
Excuse me, you.

00:04:51.901 --> 00:04:53.545
Want to sit together?

00:04:53.643 --> 00:04:54.865
This is not a tour group.

00:04:56.369 --> 00:04:59.425
You have no right to choose your seats as you please.

00:05:11.274 --> 00:05:12.185
Oh.

00:05:25.914 --> 00:05:28.025
You are two hours behind schedule.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.785
It's not just about the time.

00:05:31.932 --> 00:05:33.785
It's about order.

00:05:34.468 --> 00:05:35.425
And discipline.

00:05:35.785 --> 00:05:37.825
If you can’t even be on time.

00:05:38.178 --> 00:05:39.865
Then the first thing we’re going to do.

00:05:46.271 --> 00:05:47.105
Everyone!

00:05:47.612 --> 00:05:49.265
Get into push-up position!

00:05:49.606 --> 00:05:50.505
Ready!

00:05:52.006 --> 00:05:53.265
20 reps!

00:05:53.606 --> 00:05:55.585
-20 reps.
-Huh?

00:05:55.932 --> 00:05:57.065
021

00:05:57.298 --> 00:05:58.305
Step out front.

00:05:59.354 --> 00:06:00.385
Me?

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:01.505
Step out!

00:06:13.465 --> 00:06:14.585
What are your doubts?

00:06:15.594 --> 00:06:17.345
Uh, well...

00:06:18.609 --> 00:06:19.545
The ground...

00:06:19.643 --> 00:06:20.785
It's hot.

00:06:20.915 --> 00:06:21.981
The ground is hot?

00:06:22.043 --> 00:06:22.545
Yes.

00:06:23.298 --> 00:06:24.105
So what?

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:25.545
A police career.

00:06:25.612 --> 00:06:27.265
You think we only work in air-conditioned rooms?

00:06:28.135 --> 00:06:29.505
-No, sir.
-Silence!

00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:31.265
I am the instructor.

00:06:31.741 --> 00:06:33.025
You are the trainee.

00:06:33.637 --> 00:06:35.025
Unless I give you permission.

00:06:35.926 --> 00:06:37.105
Do not talk back.

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:38.043
Understood?

00:06:40.148 --> 00:06:41.908
-Understood!
-Understood.

00:06:45.809 --> 00:06:47.083
In real life.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.465
If someone important to you

00:06:50.012 --> 00:06:51.440
was in danger.

00:06:52.271 --> 00:06:53.265
What would you do?

00:06:54.105 --> 00:06:55.305
Would you just let them die?

00:06:56.394 --> 00:06:57.385
Or would you find a way to save them?

00:07:06.148 --> 00:07:06.825
Everyone!

00:07:07.618 --> 00:07:08.825
Get into push-up position!

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.105
Ready.

00:07:10.326 --> 00:07:11.465
30 reps.

00:07:11.625 --> 00:07:12.945
30 reps.

00:07:13.741 --> 00:07:14.785
Wait a second.

00:07:14.917 --> 00:07:15.985
Didn't you just say...

00:07:16.191 --> 00:07:16.985
20

00:07:17.625 --> 00:07:19.185
Didn't you?

00:07:19.255 --> 00:07:20.505
Did I give you permission to speak?

00:07:23.698 --> 00:07:25.505
The count will increase every time

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:26.911
you speak

00:07:27.101 --> 00:07:28.425
without permission.

00:07:28.972 --> 00:07:29.985
Show doubt,

00:07:30.818 --> 00:07:31.945
or ask questions.

00:07:32.683 --> 00:07:34.465
Especially for inappropriate

00:07:34.972 --> 00:07:36.065
and improper conduct.

00:07:37.705 --> 00:07:39.145
Anyone else have any questions?

00:07:41.071 --> 00:07:42.535
Anyone else have any questions?

00:07:44.326 --> 00:07:45.265
No, sir.

00:07:47.514 --> 00:07:48.785
Get into push-up position!

00:07:49.175 --> 00:07:50.065
Ready.

00:07:50.849 --> 00:07:52.305
30 reps.

00:07:52.449 --> 00:07:53.834
30 reps.

00:07:54.265 --> 00:07:54.945
Execute!

00:08:00.705 --> 00:08:01.665
One.

00:08:02.461 --> 00:08:03.425
Two.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.545
Three.

00:08:05.089 --> 00:08:05.985
Four.

00:08:06.461 --> 00:08:07.385
Five.

00:08:07.698 --> 00:08:08.505
Six.

00:08:09.034 --> 00:08:09.905
Seven.

00:08:10.277 --> 00:08:11.225
Eight.

00:08:11.655 --> 00:08:12.425
Nine.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.665
Ten.

00:08:14.658 --> 00:08:15.625
Everyone!

00:08:16.283 --> 00:08:17.945
Line up in three rows!

00:08:19.865 --> 00:08:23.425
-Where? Wait for me.
-Form a line!

00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:24.545
-Hey.
-Hey.

00:08:25.206 --> 00:08:26.745
Form a line!

00:08:27.071 --> 00:08:28.065
Hey.

00:08:31.157 --> 00:08:33.185
There will be no orientation today.

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:35.705
No lunch break either.

00:08:35.791 --> 00:08:37.345
Our time is limited,

00:08:38.197 --> 00:08:41.345
and I don’t want it to
interfere with other training days.

00:08:42.068 --> 00:08:43.585
Now, go inside and change your clothes.

00:08:44.474 --> 00:08:46.025
Take care of your personal business.

00:08:46.437 --> 00:08:47.905
Leave all personal belongings

00:08:48.511 --> 00:08:49.905
in the hall.

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:52.025
Do you all understand?

00:08:52.246 --> 00:08:53.185
Understood!

00:08:53.557 --> 00:08:54.945
Do you all understand?

00:08:55.034 --> 00:08:55.834
Understood!

00:08:56.065 --> 00:08:57.225
Understood.

00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:59.145
You have five minutes.

00:08:59.311 --> 00:09:00.406
Dismissed!

00:09:03.145 --> 00:09:04.385
-Hey.
-Hey.

00:09:10.025 --> 00:09:11.425
Oh no, oh no!

00:09:14.591 --> 00:09:15.458
Geez.

00:09:55.169 --> 00:09:56.332
Hold still.

00:11:01.311 --> 00:11:02.265
Ten.

00:11:02.843 --> 00:11:03.785
Nine.

00:11:04.437 --> 00:11:05.305
Eight.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.425
Seven.

00:11:09.483 --> 00:11:10.425
Six.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.065
Five.

00:11:13.717 --> 00:11:14.585
Four.

00:11:15.655 --> 00:11:16.545
Three.

00:11:17.606 --> 00:11:18.505
Two.

00:11:19.538 --> 00:11:20.385
One.

00:11:24.745 --> 00:11:26.074
Form a line.

00:11:30.018 --> 00:11:30.825
Stay still.

00:11:34.252 --> 00:11:35.385
Before we begin the training,

00:11:36.929 --> 00:11:38.505
I want to remind everyone

00:11:39.003 --> 00:11:40.065
of the rules and regulations

00:11:40.148 --> 00:11:41.825
that were briefed during the journey.

00:11:42.621 --> 00:11:43.905
I expect everyone

00:11:44.172 --> 00:11:45.225
to uphold

00:11:45.825 --> 00:11:47.305
and strictly follow these rules.

00:11:48.898 --> 00:11:49.785
While we are here,

00:11:52.123 --> 00:11:53.825
we will only address each other by number.

00:11:56.455 --> 00:11:57.985
New Prison Near Me.

00:12:19.415 --> 00:12:20.345
021

00:12:21.354 --> 00:12:22.265
step forward.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.425
step forward!

00:12:34.425 --> 00:12:35.305
About face.

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:39.585
About face!

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.625
Are you saying this place is a prison?

00:13:01.914 --> 00:13:02.825
Yes.

00:13:06.831 --> 00:13:07.825
Anyone else?

00:13:09.292 --> 00:13:11.040
Think this place is a prison?

00:13:24.289 --> 00:13:25.665
Mark my words, 021.

00:13:27.705 --> 00:13:28.825
One rotten fish

00:13:30.191 --> 00:13:31.385
will make the whole canal stink.

00:13:34.289 --> 00:13:36.385
It means if one person fails,

00:13:38.061 --> 00:13:40.145
everyone pays the price.

00:13:46.129 --> 00:13:46.945
Everyone!

00:13:47.914 --> 00:13:48.745
Get down!

00:13:53.169 --> 00:13:53.905
Up.

00:13:58.061 --> 00:13:59.465
Ten more reps.

00:14:00.031 --> 00:14:00.825
Execute!

00:14:05.237 --> 00:14:05.905
Up.

00:14:12.338 --> 00:14:13.225
Down.

00:14:18.609 --> 00:14:19.785
Up.

00:14:26.523 --> 00:14:27.585
Down.

00:14:31.778 --> 00:14:32.785
Up.

00:14:38.025 --> 00:14:38.905
Down.

00:15:02.461 --> 00:15:03.425
This is not a prison.

00:15:06.326 --> 00:15:07.545
But if you

00:15:08.305 --> 00:15:09.505
lack discipline,

00:15:10.265 --> 00:15:11.625
I will make this place.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.105
Far worse than any prison.

00:15:14.634 --> 00:15:15.465
Understand?

00:15:18.818 --> 00:15:19.825
Understand.

00:15:28.738 --> 00:15:29.865
Sprinting start! To the classroom building!

00:15:31.105 --> 00:15:33.335
Catch the slowest one

00:15:35.532 --> 00:15:36.385
Exceute!

00:15:43.643 --> 00:15:46.145
Instructor, please train my daughter well.

00:15:46.855 --> 00:15:47.905
No favoritism.

00:15:48.098 --> 00:15:49.025
No special treatment.

00:15:50.037 --> 00:15:51.065
Wrong is wrong.

00:15:51.963 --> 00:15:53.649
Fill in whatever she lacks.

00:15:54.665 --> 00:15:56.720
I want my daughter to be a survivor.

00:15:57.323 --> 00:15:58.603
And to be able to stand on her own

00:16:00.388 --> 00:16:01.341
Yes, sir.

00:16:03.926 --> 00:16:07.945
The second thing we’re going to
discuss is the VIP Context profile.

00:16:08.049 --> 00:16:08.825
Or

00:16:08.923 --> 00:16:10.948
Identifying who the individual is.

00:16:12.098 --> 00:16:13.286
Excuse me.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.326
Who exactly is the
individual requiring protection?

00:16:30.394 --> 00:16:35.185
They must have a position, a role,
or a background that makes them a target.

00:16:35.329 --> 00:16:39.545
What kind of situation are they in?
Such as a politician, a famous businessperson,

00:16:39.631 --> 00:16:41.465
or attending an important ceremony?

00:16:41.514 --> 00:16:42.265
Okay?

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.985
So, who exactly is the person needing protection?

00:16:46.425 --> 00:16:47.538
Some people

00:16:47.594 --> 00:16:49.194
don't even hold any important positions.

00:16:49.858 --> 00:16:51.692
May I please go sit with my friend?

00:16:53.175 --> 00:16:54.289
Please do.

00:16:56.277 --> 00:16:58.625
Whether they are in politics, business,

00:16:58.726 --> 00:17:00.385
Or attending major ceremonies.

00:17:00.461 --> 00:17:04.585
Because there’s a clear
schedule, they can pinpoint exactly

00:17:04.769 --> 00:17:09.065
where the target will be, what time
the person we’re protecting will take the stage.

00:17:09.212 --> 00:17:13.025
And how long they will be
speaking. Therefore, it makes

00:17:13.071 --> 00:17:14.545
them an easy target for an attack.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.665
Now, let's look at the types of individuals.

00:17:16.763 --> 00:17:19.188
First, of course, are members of the Royal Family.

00:17:19.791 --> 00:17:21.825
-And National Leaders.
-Thank you.

00:17:22.381 --> 00:17:23.865
Heads of diplomatic organizations,

00:17:24.006 --> 00:17:25.225
public figures,

00:17:25.465 --> 00:17:26.505
and

00:17:26.677 --> 00:17:27.865
key witnesses.

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:32.905
-Or high-risk targets.
-These are.

00:17:33.563 --> 00:17:35.425
Are they training us to be Navy SEALs?

00:17:36.031 --> 00:17:37.265
Why does it have to be

00:17:37.452 --> 00:17:38.985
this incredibly difficult and exhausting?

00:17:39.089 --> 00:17:40.865
It involves security,

00:17:40.945 --> 00:17:41.985
national stability,

00:17:42.277 --> 00:17:44.265
and even the image of this organization.

00:17:46.886 --> 00:17:47.825
So...

00:17:48.061 --> 00:17:50.548
What exactly is this training anyway?

00:17:56.394 --> 00:17:58.369
VIP Protection.

00:17:59.477 --> 00:18:00.705
What kind of VIP is this?

00:18:00.763 --> 00:18:03.440
It's a specialized training program for VIPs only.

00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:05.274
It’s not organized very often, sweetie.

00:18:17.397 --> 00:18:18.418
Dad.

00:18:27.772 --> 00:18:29.077
Keep it down.

00:18:29.169 --> 00:18:30.671
We’re going to get scolded again.

00:18:43.871 --> 00:18:45.265
Please don't worry, sir.

00:18:45.514 --> 00:18:46.505
Doctor Anya

00:18:46.545 --> 00:18:48.185
is considered one of our finest doctors.

00:18:48.326 --> 00:18:49.914
-Thank you, sir.
-Yes.

00:18:50.825 --> 00:18:52.385
There’s something I’d like to ask you, sir.

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:52.905
Yes?

00:18:53.729 --> 00:18:56.074
Has anything unusual happened lately?

00:18:57.065 --> 00:18:58.240
Unusual in what way?

00:18:58.923 --> 00:19:03.594
Like someone tailing you, or more
strangers appearing around you than usual?

00:19:03.938 --> 00:19:04.945
Umm.

00:19:06.092 --> 00:19:07.185
Not that I'm aware of.

00:19:08.554 --> 00:19:09.385
Um...

00:19:09.563 --> 00:19:11.065
What exactly are you trying to warn me about?

00:19:11.151 --> 00:19:12.065
Or.

00:19:12.228 --> 00:19:13.425
Have you found out something?

00:19:15.212 --> 00:19:16.865
We should probably talk somewhere else.

00:19:17.151 --> 00:19:18.425
This place isn't private enough.

00:19:20.775 --> 00:19:21.545
Sounds good.

00:19:21.809 --> 00:19:23.545
I have a meeting at the Ministry today.

00:19:23.821 --> 00:19:25.785
I'll call you once I'm finished.

00:19:25.865 --> 00:19:26.265
Understood.

00:19:26.486 --> 00:19:27.825
Yes, sir.

00:19:54.757 --> 00:19:57.665
The Director has been shot!
I need one nurse to assist, now!

00:19:58.203 --> 00:20:01.305
-Director shot, front of hospital. Need backup now!
-Copy. Need med kit.

00:20:14.905 --> 00:20:15.505
Hmph.

00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:17.185
How incredibly outrageous.

00:20:18.123 --> 00:20:19.674
Right in the middle of a hospital.

00:20:20.148 --> 00:20:22.160
Right in front of a
high-ranking police officer, too.

00:20:22.726 --> 00:20:24.437
They really have no fear at all.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.581
You should be careful too, Mr. Phakphoom.

00:20:38.412 --> 00:20:40.966
As someone who has worked with you before,

00:20:42.258 --> 00:20:44.061
I am truly concerned.

00:20:44.461 --> 00:20:45.686
Thank you.

00:20:47.009 --> 00:20:49.489
I'm keeping my guard up at all times these days.

00:20:51.341 --> 00:20:52.225
That's good.

00:20:53.274 --> 00:20:53.905
By the way

00:20:54.997 --> 00:20:56.948
Your daughter makes such delicious cakes.

00:20:58.369 --> 00:21:00.369
Why did you let her become a police officer?

00:21:07.661 --> 00:21:10.037
This is the list of individuals at high risk, sir.

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:15.194
Is Director Dilok on the list too?

00:21:15.366 --> 00:21:16.375
Yes, sir.

00:21:16.541 --> 00:21:18.545
Director Dilok was the one
who signed off on the building.

00:21:18.591 --> 00:21:22.172
Constructed by Minister Burin's nominee company.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.345
Left, left.

00:21:26.443 --> 00:21:27.905
Left, right, left.

00:21:27.969 --> 00:21:29.354
-Left, left
-Left, right.

00:21:29.428 --> 00:21:31.145
Left, right, left.

00:21:31.231 --> 00:21:32.985
Left, left.

00:21:33.046 --> 00:21:34.705
Left, right, left.

00:21:43.575 --> 00:21:44.865
Left, left.

00:21:44.905 --> 00:21:46.385
-Left, right, left.
-Careful, careful.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.012
Line, stop!

00:21:48.117 --> 00:21:48.945
Tired.

00:22:01.212 --> 00:22:02.145
You again?

00:22:02.215 --> 00:22:02.905
021

00:22:05.305 --> 00:22:06.185
What is this?

00:22:06.585 --> 00:22:08.560
So weak and so useless.

00:22:09.391 --> 00:22:10.954
You can't even handle a simple run.

00:22:11.612 --> 00:22:12.775
What are you even doing here?

00:22:13.268 --> 00:22:14.145
Did you come here to train.

00:22:14.443 --> 00:22:15.938
Or did you just come here to be looked down upon?

00:22:21.858 --> 00:22:23.225
And what if I told you...

00:22:23.532 --> 00:22:25.225
That I never wanted to be here in the first place?

00:22:25.255 --> 00:22:26.305
Then why are you here?

00:22:27.415 --> 00:22:29.345
It doesn’t matter whether you want to be here or not.

00:22:29.661 --> 00:22:31.514
You are here now. So, what is your purpose?

00:22:33.003 --> 00:22:34.465
If you can't handle it.

00:22:34.945 --> 00:22:36.265
You can go home right now.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.237
Everyone else has to sit
around and wait for you like this.

00:22:46.215 --> 00:22:47.865
So, if I’m just slower than the others.

00:22:48.369 --> 00:22:50.006
Weaker than the others

00:22:50.541 --> 00:22:53.705
or just hungry because
I skipped lunch, and that's such a huge mistake.

00:22:54.123 --> 00:22:55.745
Then I guess I really don't belong here.

00:22:55.785 --> 00:22:56.625
Yes, it is a mistake.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:57.889
We are police.

00:22:57.988 --> 00:22:59.391
The people rely on us.

00:22:59.538 --> 00:23:00.825
If you can't even handle this.

00:23:01.065 --> 00:23:03.034
Then just go home. Go!

00:23:06.031 --> 00:23:07.446
Is there anyone else who can't take it?

00:23:08.615 --> 00:23:09.505
If you can't handle it.

00:23:09.606 --> 00:23:11.735
you can leave with 021 right now.

00:23:52.166 --> 00:23:53.265
You.

00:23:59.397 --> 00:24:00.225
You.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:06.865
You.

00:24:08.437 --> 00:24:09.311
You.

00:24:10.751 --> 00:24:11.772
Are you okay?

00:24:13.025 --> 00:24:14.025
Take a deep breath first.

00:24:14.123 --> 00:24:15.649
Just breathe. Stay calm.

00:24:37.305 --> 00:24:38.305
You.

00:25:04.369 --> 00:25:06.265
She's been asleep for three hours now.

00:25:06.548 --> 00:25:08.185
Shouldn't we take her to the hospital?

00:25:09.175 --> 00:25:10.385
Tarn.

00:25:10.738 --> 00:25:12.745
Look, I'm a doctor, okay?

00:25:13.046 --> 00:25:15.265
I can definitely assess a patient's condition.

00:25:15.631 --> 00:25:18.338
She's just stressed, exhausted, and
hasn't eaten anything since this morning.

00:25:18.954 --> 00:25:19.825
Hey.

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:20.985
It's fine.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.065
Hey.

00:25:29.803 --> 00:25:30.705
She’s awake.

00:25:37.145 --> 00:25:38.185
How are you feeling?

00:25:38.492 --> 00:25:41.114
Do you have a headache or feel like vomiting?

00:25:41.988 --> 00:25:43.265
I'm hungry.

00:25:44.375 --> 00:25:45.545
Are you thirsty?

00:25:50.991 --> 00:25:51.905
Let's get you up first.

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:00.665
Have some water.

00:26:22.572 --> 00:26:24.425
I'm hungry for food.

00:26:24.831 --> 00:26:25.465
Oh.

00:26:52.665 --> 00:26:54.314
Can I borrow your phone, please?

00:26:56.695 --> 00:26:58.385
I'm going to call my dad to come pick me up.

00:27:03.705 --> 00:27:04.665
Hey, Noey.

00:27:07.852 --> 00:27:08.705
Yeah.

00:27:11.175 --> 00:27:13.594
Get up. Step outside for a moment.

00:27:15.526 --> 00:27:16.825
Can't I stay?

00:27:26.825 --> 00:27:29.348
You said you didn't want to be here from the start.

00:27:30.228 --> 00:27:31.760
So, if you decide to leave.

00:27:31.914 --> 00:27:33.434
I understand.

00:27:35.126 --> 00:27:36.945
But it's only the first day.

00:27:37.581 --> 00:27:40.000
Don't you want to stay and
fight just a little longer?

00:27:42.621 --> 00:27:43.705
Stay and prove.

00:27:43.785 --> 00:27:46.012
Show the people who think you've already given up

00:27:46.314 --> 00:27:49.040
that you aren't as weak as they thought.

00:27:53.711 --> 00:27:55.345
But the truth is...

00:27:56.258 --> 00:27:58.394
I am as weak as they think I am.

00:28:04.517 --> 00:28:07.105
Anyone who has the guts
to speak to an instructor like that.

00:28:07.169 --> 00:28:08.997
Is not a weak person at all.

00:28:09.446 --> 00:28:12.068
A weak body can be trained.

00:28:12.326 --> 00:28:14.425
But a heart as strong as yours.

00:28:15.046 --> 00:28:17.218
Is something not everyone has.

00:28:20.745 --> 00:28:21.926
Thank you.

00:28:22.941 --> 00:28:24.597
For not seeing me as a burden.

00:28:32.578 --> 00:28:33.305
Hey.

00:28:34.055 --> 00:28:36.541
Nobody is good at this from day one.

00:28:37.317 --> 00:28:39.194
When I was at the police academy.

00:28:40.203 --> 00:28:41.778
I was even worse than you.

00:28:42.375 --> 00:28:44.880
I even cried and begged to go home.

00:28:47.132 --> 00:28:49.618
I don't know who forced you to come here.

00:28:50.443 --> 00:28:51.920
but I believe.

00:28:52.283 --> 00:28:54.145
They definitely mean well.

00:28:55.434 --> 00:28:57.612
Because if you can make it through these seven days.

00:28:59.046 --> 00:29:00.806
You’ll gain both experience

00:29:01.046 --> 00:29:02.865
and discover a strength

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.163
you never knew you had.

00:29:10.658 --> 00:29:12.305
The instructor asked me to tell you.

00:29:12.492 --> 00:29:14.388
You can stay the night here if you want.

00:29:15.194 --> 00:29:17.391
I'll grab your things and bring them over for you.

00:29:18.345 --> 00:29:19.385
And...

00:29:20.055 --> 00:29:22.898
You can make your final decision tomorrow.

00:29:36.757 --> 00:29:39.969
The trainees for the Executive Protection Course.

00:29:40.105 --> 00:29:41.625
Have a total strength of

00:29:42.111 --> 00:29:43.545
21 personnel.

00:29:43.729 --> 00:29:45.311
20 are present.

00:29:46.166 --> 00:29:47.163
Missing.

00:29:47.735 --> 00:29:49.040
I hope...

00:29:49.871 --> 00:29:52.545
I'll see you at the morning workout.

00:29:54.788 --> 00:29:55.705
See you.

00:30:03.729 --> 00:30:05.741
I'm here.

00:30:17.505 --> 00:30:19.778
I'm here.

00:30:40.837 --> 00:30:42.332
Permission to join the formation.

00:30:55.569 --> 00:30:58.265
Trainees of the Executive Protection Course,

00:30:58.505 --> 00:30:59.905
Total strength,

00:30:59.957 --> 00:31:01.225
21 personnel.

00:31:01.323 --> 00:31:02.145
All present.

00:31:02.301 --> 00:31:03.505
21 present.

00:31:03.594 --> 00:31:05.261
Ready for training.

00:31:07.145 --> 00:31:08.105
Take your position!

00:31:11.255 --> 00:31:12.480
All trainees.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:13.505
Right.

00:31:13.674 --> 00:31:14.385
Face!

00:31:18.738 --> 00:31:20.265
Forward, run!

00:31:32.068 --> 00:31:33.265
Sprint to the classroom building!

00:31:34.388 --> 00:31:36.486
Catch the slowest runner!

00:31:39.637 --> 00:31:41.169
30 reps.

00:31:41.926 --> 00:31:42.705
One.

00:31:43.046 --> 00:31:43.988
Two.

00:31:44.123 --> 00:31:45.025
Three.

00:31:45.421 --> 00:31:46.305
One.

00:31:53.452 --> 00:31:54.683
Sprint to the classroom building!

00:31:55.588 --> 00:31:57.397
The last two.

00:32:02.695 --> 00:32:04.345
30 jumps, now!

00:32:05.471 --> 00:32:06.385
One.

00:32:06.634 --> 00:32:07.674
Two.

00:32:08.271 --> 00:32:09.145
Three.

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:10.745
Four.

00:32:15.649 --> 00:32:16.695
One.

00:32:17.409 --> 00:32:18.517
Two.

00:32:18.855 --> 00:32:19.865
Three.

00:32:20.535 --> 00:32:21.920
Sprint to the classroom building!

00:32:22.923 --> 00:32:24.345
The last one.

00:32:24.991 --> 00:32:26.818
Five more minutes.

00:32:42.548 --> 00:32:44.105
Yay!

00:32:55.711 --> 00:32:56.621
One.

00:32:56.941 --> 00:32:57.745
Two.

00:32:58.191 --> 00:32:59.065
Three.

00:32:59.428 --> 00:33:00.265
One.

00:33:08.905 --> 00:33:09.705
Everyone.

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:10.585
Sit.

00:33:18.271 --> 00:33:19.145
021

00:33:22.394 --> 00:33:23.225
Step out.

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:38.625
Steady!

00:33:40.105 --> 00:33:41.145
Push-up position.

00:33:44.018 --> 00:33:44.945
Ready.

00:34:03.914 --> 00:34:05.101
Stand up!

00:34:11.261 --> 00:34:12.455
Return to your position.

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.517
Thank you.

00:34:24.252 --> 00:34:25.754
Shift formation!

00:34:26.388 --> 00:34:27.797
Two steps!

00:34:28.209 --> 00:34:29.366
Three steps!

00:34:43.397 --> 00:34:46.929
I assume you've all had some
experience in hand-to-hand combat.

00:34:47.649 --> 00:34:48.634
But today.

00:34:49.372 --> 00:34:51.345
We won't be practicing how to strike,

00:34:51.477 --> 00:34:52.431
how to parry,

00:34:53.298 --> 00:34:55.089
or how to use brute force alone.

00:34:55.378 --> 00:34:56.945
Because in a real-life situation,

00:34:57.243 --> 00:34:58.954
the enemy is often armed.

00:34:59.434 --> 00:35:00.665
Whether it’s a wooden stick,

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.185
a knife,

00:35:03.169 --> 00:35:04.486
or even a firearm.

00:35:05.748 --> 00:35:07.397
Therefore, today’s training

00:35:07.932 --> 00:35:09.908
will simulate a real-life situation.

00:35:11.095 --> 00:35:13.237
I need one volunteer.

00:35:18.911 --> 00:35:20.123
001

00:35:20.351 --> 00:35:21.345
Please step forward.

00:35:23.231 --> 00:35:24.172
Instructor.

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.665
Move one.

00:35:38.658 --> 00:35:39.834
Move two.

00:35:46.892 --> 00:35:48.012
Move three.

00:35:53.114 --> 00:35:54.129
001

00:35:54.357 --> 00:35:55.366
Back to your position.

00:35:57.021 --> 00:35:58.145
Everyone,

00:35:58.314 --> 00:35:59.409
Please pair up.

00:35:59.852 --> 00:36:01.815
And break off for practice.

00:36:03.471 --> 00:36:05.452
Since we have 21 people,

00:36:06.314 --> 00:36:08.695
the last person without a partner,

00:36:09.458 --> 00:36:11.612
will pair up with the assistant instructor.

00:36:22.849 --> 00:36:23.815
You.

00:36:24.283 --> 00:36:25.772
Do you want to pair up?

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.465
I've already got a partner.

00:36:35.083 --> 00:36:35.985
Want to be partners?

00:36:43.625 --> 00:36:44.517
Go.

00:37:04.117 --> 00:37:05.052
Okay.

00:37:05.465 --> 00:37:06.425
I'll go first.

00:37:09.729 --> 00:37:10.985
Hold it up.

00:37:17.341 --> 00:37:18.591
Ready?

00:37:30.086 --> 00:37:32.338
-Ouch!
-You.

00:37:33.452 --> 00:37:34.658
Are you hurt?

00:37:35.741 --> 00:37:36.695
Sorry.

00:37:37.311 --> 00:37:38.225
Okay.

00:37:40.314 --> 00:37:41.397
Again.

00:37:42.228 --> 00:37:43.268
Stand up.

00:37:44.652 --> 00:37:45.791
Now, your turn.

00:37:45.988 --> 00:37:47.665
It's nothing.

00:37:58.123 --> 00:38:00.031
Grab the wrist with your left arm.

00:38:01.009 --> 00:38:02.246
Step in with your right leg

00:38:04.345 --> 00:38:05.745
Lock the waist and throw.

00:38:05.834 --> 00:38:06.465
Go.

00:38:13.021 --> 00:38:14.265
Again.

00:38:15.274 --> 00:38:16.849
How did I do it?

00:38:17.957 --> 00:38:18.945
Use your hips

00:38:18.997 --> 00:38:19.985
to drive the throw.

00:38:20.615 --> 00:38:21.505
Like this.

00:38:23.132 --> 00:38:24.025
Ready?

00:38:30.554 --> 00:38:31.345
Yes.

00:38:33.754 --> 00:38:34.585
Okay.

00:38:44.985 --> 00:38:46.898
Whoa! I did it!

00:38:48.849 --> 00:38:49.828
Whoa.

00:38:50.634 --> 00:38:51.735
Good job!

00:39:09.071 --> 00:39:10.560
This is the room.

00:39:14.874 --> 00:39:15.938
Wait a moment.

00:39:15.975 --> 00:39:16.585
This...

00:39:16.714 --> 00:39:17.825
Do I really have to sleep

00:39:17.905 --> 00:39:19.665
in this room all alone?

00:39:19.994 --> 00:39:20.745
Yes.

00:39:20.806 --> 00:39:23.825
The room assignments were all settled last night.

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:26.732
Or else, someone would have
to volunteer to move in with you.

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:36.545
I'll sleep here to keep you company.

00:39:42.966 --> 00:39:44.388
Thank you.

00:39:45.163 --> 00:39:46.465
You can pick your bed first.

00:39:46.941 --> 00:39:47.665
Oh.

00:39:47.754 --> 00:39:49.105
You can choose first.

00:39:49.637 --> 00:39:51.545
Whichever bed you pick,

00:39:51.581 --> 00:39:53.305
I'll just take the one right next to yours.

00:39:55.372 --> 00:39:57.225
Then, I'll take this one.

00:39:58.628 --> 00:39:59.145
Alright.

00:39:59.255 --> 00:40:00.621
I'll take this one then.

00:40:04.092 --> 00:40:06.105
We each get our own locker.

00:40:06.474 --> 00:40:09.748
Usually, the instructors
even check inside the lockers.

00:40:10.098 --> 00:40:12.061
No unnecessary items allowed.

00:40:12.548 --> 00:40:13.809
But since...

00:40:14.345 --> 00:40:15.865
This is a special training program.

00:40:15.932 --> 00:40:17.225
They're being a bit lenient.

00:40:19.391 --> 00:40:20.548
Oh.

00:40:21.058 --> 00:40:22.545
It looks like you're heading to the Maldives!

00:40:23.963 --> 00:40:26.065
Looks like you've been scammed into this training.

00:40:28.381 --> 00:40:29.825
Something like that.

00:40:44.265 --> 00:40:45.465
Ms. tarn.

00:40:47.545 --> 00:40:48.945
Ms. 007

00:40:49.655 --> 00:40:52.025
I forgot to bring my charger.

00:40:52.172 --> 00:40:55.009
Mind if I use yours after you?

00:40:56.498 --> 00:40:57.345
Sure.

00:41:08.468 --> 00:41:09.425
I...

00:41:09.612 --> 00:41:11.505
I really like your passcode.

00:41:11.846 --> 00:41:13.145
007

00:41:13.465 --> 00:41:15.025
It’s just like my favorite movie.

00:41:15.163 --> 00:41:16.865
I've seen all the sequels.

00:41:18.431 --> 00:41:19.741
I like it too.

00:41:20.148 --> 00:41:22.806
I can't believe you're into action movies.

00:41:25.477 --> 00:41:27.015
And what about me?

00:41:27.938 --> 00:41:29.505
What kind of movies do you think I like?

00:41:31.551 --> 00:41:32.665
Well...

00:41:32.972 --> 00:41:34.345
Probably comedies.

00:41:34.874 --> 00:41:36.705
A pretty but goofy kind of heroine.

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:39.225
Wait.

00:41:40.449 --> 00:41:42.305
Are you saying I'm goofy?

00:41:44.554 --> 00:41:45.425
No.

00:41:45.545 --> 00:41:46.585
No.

00:41:47.058 --> 00:41:47.785
I mean.

00:41:48.689 --> 00:41:49.425
Well...

00:41:49.489 --> 00:41:50.905
You're not that goofy,

00:41:55.274 --> 00:41:56.625
But,

00:41:56.978 --> 00:41:57.985
You are beautiful.

00:42:14.461 --> 00:42:16.145
It feels a bit strange.

00:42:17.145 --> 00:42:18.935
Being called beautiful

00:42:20.068 --> 00:42:21.618
by someone as beautiful as you

00:42:43.385 --> 00:42:44.695
Oh.

00:42:45.366 --> 00:42:47.305
The bed and pillow are so hard.

00:42:47.397 --> 00:42:48.905
How am I supposed to sleep?

00:42:48.997 --> 00:42:50.794
I always have trouble falling asleep.

00:42:52.197 --> 00:42:53.914
It’s only for a few more nights.

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.585
Bear with it for a bit.

00:42:55.846 --> 00:42:58.738
If you could survive
the training, you can survive this.

00:43:00.443 --> 00:43:01.505
Tell you what.

00:43:01.649 --> 00:43:03.625
If you can’t sleep, I’ve got a secret trick.

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:23.825
Hard to sleep? Yeah, right.

00:43:39.637 --> 00:43:40.800
Hello.

00:43:43.465 --> 00:43:44.425
Oh.

00:44:02.572 --> 00:44:05.021
Are you mad at me? She isn't picking up.

00:44:05.415 --> 00:44:07.643
Maybe she is just chatting with friends.

00:44:08.757 --> 00:44:10.825
Or just exhausted and already fast asleep.

00:44:13.711 --> 00:44:14.714
You can leave now.

00:44:14.843 --> 00:44:15.585
Yes, sir.

00:44:15.797 --> 00:44:18.185
I will come to pick you up
at 6:30 tomorrow morning, sir.

00:44:18.258 --> 00:44:18.985
Umm.

00:44:33.046 --> 00:44:34.529
Don't be mad at me.

00:44:36.511 --> 00:44:37.545
021

00:44:37.618 --> 00:44:38.465
Wake up.

00:44:41.105 --> 00:44:43.105
021 wake up.

00:44:48.757 --> 00:44:50.505
We are on guard duty tonight.

00:44:50.566 --> 00:44:52.468
You fell asleep before me, so I didn't tell you.

00:44:53.446 --> 00:44:54.529
You.

00:44:54.695 --> 00:44:56.381
Umm.

00:45:05.385 --> 00:45:07.237
Aren’t you sleepy, Ms. Tarn?

00:45:09.212 --> 00:45:10.265
Don't use names, please.

00:45:10.308 --> 00:45:11.145
It's against the rules.

00:45:15.926 --> 00:45:17.065
At this hour?

00:45:17.138 --> 00:45:18.625
Who’s going to hear us?

00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:24.185
Since it's a rule.

00:45:24.289 --> 00:45:26.825
Even if no one knows, you still shouldn't break it.

00:45:28.074 --> 00:45:28.945
You are

00:45:29.077 --> 00:45:30.465
just as strict as my father.

00:45:31.077 --> 00:45:32.345
My dad,

00:45:32.548 --> 00:45:34.225
He's a perfectionist with everything.

00:45:34.314 --> 00:45:37.329
Strict with work, strict with
every detail, and strict with everyone.

00:45:37.988 --> 00:45:39.105
Except for me.

00:45:39.711 --> 00:45:41.341
He totally spoils me.

00:45:41.957 --> 00:45:43.025
So...

00:45:43.058 --> 00:45:45.145
Why did you suddenly decide to become a cop?

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:50.283
Two months ago, I still saw you at the cake shop.

00:45:51.483 --> 00:45:52.385
Umm.

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:55.465
Actually, I graduated with a degree in languages.

00:45:55.766 --> 00:45:57.105
But I've always loved baking cakes.

00:45:57.858 --> 00:46:00.529
When I came back, my dad opened a cake shop for me.

00:46:00.745 --> 00:46:01.865
But...

00:46:02.105 --> 00:46:03.785
Something happened.

00:46:03.865 --> 00:46:05.425
That forced me to become a police.

00:46:10.258 --> 00:46:11.434
What about you?

00:46:12.911 --> 00:46:14.505
Why did you become a police.

00:46:18.092 --> 00:46:19.505
I don't really know.

00:46:20.025 --> 00:46:21.705
Why I ended up in this profession.

00:46:23.052 --> 00:46:24.305
Even though.

00:46:24.449 --> 00:46:26.185
It's a job that I should have...

00:46:30.911 --> 00:46:31.945
Never mind.

00:46:33.698 --> 00:46:35.225
I just hope that...

00:46:35.612 --> 00:46:37.345
I can save at least one good person.

00:46:37.545 --> 00:46:38.945
To ensure that justice is served.

00:46:40.221 --> 00:46:42.105
And to bring the bad guys

00:46:42.295 --> 00:46:43.545
to justice.

00:46:45.052 --> 00:46:47.465
That's more than enough to make being a cop worth it.

00:46:48.597 --> 00:46:49.465
How was that?

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:51.385
Was my answer too idealistic?

00:46:54.849 --> 00:46:56.985
Your ideals are so firm.

00:47:00.074 --> 00:47:01.985
I think if my father ever met you.

00:47:02.166 --> 00:47:04.025
He would really like you.

00:47:04.111 --> 00:47:06.345
Hey! What are you doing?

00:47:07.046 --> 00:47:08.145
It’s wrong.

00:47:09.195 --> 00:47:10.831
-It’s against the rules.
-I’m so sore.

00:47:11.403 --> 00:47:12.625
I’m exhausted.

00:48:39.058 --> 00:48:40.305
You should get some sleep.

00:48:40.646 --> 00:48:42.065
We have target practice tomorrow.

00:48:42.123 --> 00:48:44.745
You have to stand for hours.
Your legs are going to be so stiff.

00:48:56.388 --> 00:48:57.065
Hey.

00:48:57.852 --> 00:48:59.760
I haven't even showered yet.

00:49:00.708 --> 00:49:02.837
I feel so sticky.

00:49:03.348 --> 00:49:04.545
Absolutely not.

00:49:04.997 --> 00:49:06.065
It's against the rules.

00:49:07.065 --> 00:49:08.345
Please.

00:49:08.751 --> 00:49:10.625
Can I please go take a shower first?

00:49:10.745 --> 00:49:11.705
Please?

00:49:11.994 --> 00:49:13.145
I can't stand it anymore.

00:49:13.225 --> 00:49:14.785
I feel so dirty.

00:49:14.849 --> 00:49:15.785
Please.

00:49:23.901 --> 00:49:26.065
Showers are forbidden here
between 11 PM and midnight.

00:49:26.252 --> 00:49:27.905
Don't use the shower head.

00:49:27.945 --> 00:49:29.065
Use the water from the tub instead.

00:49:29.105 --> 00:49:30.345
And be as quiet as possible.

00:49:31.625 --> 00:49:32.185
Got it.

00:49:39.637 --> 00:49:41.145
I'll go wait outside.

00:50:03.265 --> 00:50:03.905
You.

00:50:04.092 --> 00:50:04.745
Hey.

00:50:06.603 --> 00:50:07.225
Huh?

00:50:10.055 --> 00:50:12.785
You’re supposed to use the bowl
to pour water over yourself, not soak in it.

00:50:15.815 --> 00:50:16.705
Sorry.

00:50:17.003 --> 00:50:18.305
I thought it was like

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:19.345
an onsen.

00:50:19.698 --> 00:50:22.705
I'm used to bathtubs or rain showers.

00:50:25.009 --> 00:50:26.105
Here’s the water dipper.

00:50:27.901 --> 00:50:29.661
Scoop and pour it like this.

00:50:32.861 --> 00:50:34.061
Got it.

00:50:35.981 --> 00:50:37.305
I'll go wait outside.

00:50:40.708 --> 00:50:41.745
Wait.

00:50:43.815 --> 00:50:45.025
Don't go too far.

00:50:45.495 --> 00:50:46.425
I'm scared.

00:51:38.225 --> 00:51:38.985
Hey.

00:51:39.505 --> 00:51:40.385
Someone’s coming.

00:51:41.625 --> 00:51:42.385
Who is it?

00:51:43.145 --> 00:51:44.065
-Where.
-Go.

00:51:44.705 --> 00:51:45.545
Hurry.

00:52:59.505 --> 00:53:01.185
Are you coming out on your own?

00:53:01.865 --> 00:53:04.025
Or I'll break it down and double your penalty.

00:53:21.345 --> 00:53:22.265
Hello, mom.

00:53:26.865 --> 00:53:27.385
Ah.

00:53:27.505 --> 00:53:28.345
Yes.

00:53:30.225 --> 00:53:30.905
Yes.

00:53:53.265 --> 00:53:54.065
Why...

00:53:55.514 --> 00:53:57.643
Your heart is beating so fast.

00:54:59.692 --> 00:55:02.345
Since we're here in the gym alone together.

00:55:02.455 --> 00:55:04.865
Let's make good use of our free time.

00:55:05.138 --> 00:55:06.505
Who broke the rules last night?

00:55:09.101 --> 00:55:10.865
Do you guys actually believe that?

00:55:10.972 --> 00:55:12.665
That someone as strict as her would break the rules?

00:55:13.501 --> 00:55:15.225
If it wasn't her, then who else could it be?

00:55:16.585 --> 00:55:19.185
My son just came back from abroad earlier this year.

00:55:19.526 --> 00:55:22.145
I'd like him to get to know your daughter.

00:55:22.332 --> 00:55:23.905
If the two of them like each other.

00:55:23.975 --> 00:55:25.145
That would be wonderful.

00:55:26.074 --> 00:55:28.338
Why is 007 in such a state?

00:55:30.675 --> 00:55:32.675
