00:12:11.891 --> 00:12:14.397
She's never actually said
something was pretty before.

00:12:15.061 --> 00:12:17.104
Come to think of it,

00:12:17.104 --> 00:12:19.677
we always bought things
because we were short on something,

00:12:19.677 --> 00:12:20.890
or...

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.368
because we needed them.

00:12:23.368 --> 00:12:25.530
So...

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:28.324
this is the first thing
that's really her taste.

00:12:28.324 --> 00:12:30.993
That's why I really want to get it for her.

00:12:30.993 --> 00:12:32.913
It's just... money's kind of tight.

00:12:33.663 --> 00:12:34.872
Oh, right.

00:12:34.872 --> 00:12:36.786
Do you happen to have a Pimang ID?

00:12:39.001 --> 00:12:41.001
Not exactly happy to see you...

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:45.741
Okay, done.

00:12:48.728 --> 00:12:49.845
So heavy.

00:12:49.845 --> 00:12:51.550
You live alone, right?

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:52.848
Why is your place so nicely decorated?

00:12:52.848 --> 00:12:54.439
Because my space matters to me.

00:12:54.439 --> 00:12:55.688
You know, I'm "street-trained."

00:12:55.688 --> 00:12:57.937
If you wanna protect your precious space,

00:12:57.937 --> 00:12:59.914
start with this.

00:12:59.914 --> 00:13:02.191
Didn't I tell you to stop snapping
whenever your feelings get bad?

00:13:02.191 --> 00:13:04.392
I couldn't help it.

00:13:05.778 --> 00:13:07.071
Boss.

00:13:07.071 --> 00:13:08.489
Any chance you could spot me
an interest-free loan?

00:13:08.489 --> 00:13:10.032
My studio's been in the red for four months,

00:13:10.032 --> 00:13:11.382
and I even gave up my place.

00:13:11.382 --> 00:13:12.482
What are you worried about?

00:13:12.482 --> 00:13:14.870
Sell just one thing here and you'll be fine.

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:16.914
I'll make sure it sells.

00:13:16.914 --> 00:13:17.915
How about this one?

00:13:17.915 --> 00:13:20.167
- Looks brand new.
- Nope.

00:13:20.167 --> 00:13:21.294
Then what about this?

00:13:21.294 --> 00:13:22.920
The miniature furniture set looks fancy.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.964
This isn't just furniture.

00:13:24.964 --> 00:13:26.424
Charles. Elizabeth.

Alice.

00:13:27.461 --> 00:13:29.693
They're my furniture babies.

00:13:29.693 --> 00:13:31.298
Oh.

00:13:31.298 --> 00:13:32.930
- What about this?
- Are you insane?

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:34.265
That's my heart.

00:13:34.265 --> 00:13:36.245
Then we should definitely sell it.

00:13:39.521 --> 00:13:41.814
This one looks kind of old.

00:13:41.814 --> 00:13:44.347
Hey, stop it. Put that back.

00:13:45.943 --> 00:13:47.862
You have an older brother?

00:13:47.862 --> 00:13:49.348
What?

00:13:52.617 --> 00:13:53.684
I'm an only child.

00:13:53.684 --> 00:13:56.139
And that wouldn't sell for much anyway.

00:13:57.538 --> 00:13:58.664
Then...

00:13:58.664 --> 00:14:01.132
this is the only option, right?

00:14:01.132 --> 00:14:03.792
We should sell something
that actually brings in money.

00:14:04.837 --> 00:14:07.323
Like this... Straight-on shot. One-to-one.

00:14:08.215 --> 00:14:09.388

That light just popped up.

Thank you, Se Yeon.

00:14:16.098 --> 00:14:18.559
I figured you'd have it in your neighborhood.

00:14:18.559 --> 00:14:20.377
That's how the Pimang app works.

00:14:20.377 --> 00:14:22.403
Listings vary a lot by area.

00:14:22.403 --> 00:14:24.823
Perfect! Let's reach out right now.

See?

00:14:28.312 --> 00:14:29.463
They replied right away.

00:14:29.463 --> 00:14:31.364
Told you I'm good.

00:14:31.364 --> 00:14:33.783
Wow, this woman's basically a freebie fairy.

00:14:33.783 --> 00:14:35.951
She doesn't buy, she doesn't sell.

00:14:35.951 --> 00:14:37.370
She just gives stuff away.

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:39.080
Well, not a bad vibe.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.373
I think we'll get along.

00:14:40.373 --> 00:14:42.208
People like her usually don't haggle much.

00:14:42.208 --> 00:14:43.282
Easy, clean deal.

00:14:43.282 --> 00:14:45.002
We should knock off about a hundred.

00:14:45.002 --> 00:14:46.207
Ten percent is standard.

00:14:46.207 --> 00:14:47.817
Most people smile and negotiate.

00:14:47.817 --> 00:14:49.590
But this was listed at a million.

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:51.550
You think they'll come down a hundred?

- Yes.

00:14:54.942 --> 00:14:56.280
Then I'd like to buy it.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:59.247
- No haggling, okay?
- I only do clean deals.

00:14:59.247 --> 00:15:01.514
Can we meet today?

00:15:01.514 --> 00:15:02.744
What time and where?

00:15:02.744 --> 00:15:04.577
Near Seongsu Station, at four.

00:15:04.577 --> 00:15:06.783
- Does that work?
- Okay.

00:15:09.568 --> 00:15:11.115
This time,

00:15:11.115 --> 00:15:14.323
I'm really gonna use every trick I've got.

My baby...

00:15:16.784 --> 00:15:19.245
Your Dad's gonna ask all the right questions

00:15:19.245 --> 00:15:21.095
and make sure

00:15:21.747 --> 00:15:25.207
the place you're going to is really worth it.

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:03.363
Pimang?

00:16:03.363 --> 00:16:05.416
Oh, yeah. You should be "CoolDealOnly," right?

00:16:05.416 --> 00:16:06.586
You're "TakeItAll"?

00:16:06.586 --> 00:16:08.072
Right.

00:16:14.345 --> 00:16:16.577
This is Rorman, right?

00:16:16.577 --> 00:16:19.054
It is, just like in the photos,
and it's in great condition.

00:16:19.054 --> 00:16:21.307
I take really good care of my stuff,

00:16:21.307 --> 00:16:23.087
so there's barely any wear.

00:16:25.561 --> 00:16:28.419
But you know, I only do clean deals.

00:16:28.419 --> 00:16:29.471

[Round 1: Lowballing Tactic]

Any chance there's room to negotiate?

00:16:35.738 --> 00:16:37.907
You said you've had it for a year.

00:16:37.907 --> 00:16:39.909
That makes it used, doesn't it?

00:16:39.909 --> 00:16:41.007
Used?

00:16:41.007 --> 00:16:43.649
Watch your words. My baby can hear you.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.373
I've taken meticulous care of it.

00:16:46.373 --> 00:16:49.096
At this point, it's practically vintage.

I really need to buy this.

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:57.802
My sister raised me from the time I was nine.

00:16:57.802 --> 00:16:59.240
Seriously?

00:16:59.853 --> 00:17:02.088
Is it a gift for her?

00:17:03.098 --> 00:17:04.099
Yes.

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:06.496
A wedding gift.

00:17:07.459 --> 00:17:08.751
Yeah,

00:17:08.751 --> 00:17:10.356
I've heard your sob story well.

00:17:10.356 --> 00:17:12.024
What? A sob story?

00:17:12.024 --> 00:17:13.150
It's all true.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:14.318
True or not,

00:17:14.318 --> 00:17:16.320
I'm not interested in your family history.

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.322
I grew up an orphan,

00:17:18.322 --> 00:17:21.688
so that kind of sentiment doesn't move me.

A fake?

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.794
Did you just call my baby a knockoff?

00:17:31.794 --> 00:17:35.214
It's wrapped up so tight I can't even see it.

00:17:35.214 --> 00:17:37.414
Why don't you unwrap it a bit?

00:17:38.717 --> 00:17:39.748
Go ahead.

00:17:39.748 --> 00:17:42.550

What a nightmare.

00:18:06.039 --> 00:18:08.027
She even brought a power cord.

00:18:08.637 --> 00:18:10.499
It's beautiful.

- Could you take a picture?
- With me?

00:18:12.126 --> 00:18:13.419
No. Just take my picture.

00:18:13.419 --> 00:18:15.654
She's seriously unhinged.

00:18:15.654 --> 00:18:17.767
Let's just take it and get her out of here.

Gosh, does she think she's in the photo?

00:51:01.134 --> 00:51:02.469
Hey.

00:51:02.469 --> 00:51:04.037
Hey, hey!

00:51:11.937 --> 00:51:13.939
Sun Tae Hyung...

00:51:13.939 --> 00:51:15.984
Why the hell are you here,

00:51:15.984 --> 00:51:18.944
letting yourself end up like this?

00:51:18.944 --> 00:51:20.112
Hey.

00:51:20.112 --> 00:51:22.447
Why isn't your aunt here yet?

00:51:22.447 --> 00:51:23.740
When she shows up,

00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:25.185
I'm charging her for everything.

00:51:25.185 --> 00:51:27.870
From making me chief mourner
to all this hand washing.

00:51:29.032 --> 00:51:31.305
What? You smiling?

00:51:31.305 --> 00:51:32.581
This is not the time to smile.

00:51:32.581 --> 00:51:34.330
Read the room.

00:51:38.491 --> 00:51:41.143
Why is she taking so long?

00:51:41.143 --> 00:51:42.217
What's that?

00:51:42.217 --> 00:51:44.261
Why did he put the baby there?

00:51:44.261 --> 00:51:45.679
Oh my, look at that baby.

00:51:45.679 --> 00:51:46.930
What is that?

00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:48.498
Is that a baby?

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:02.120
What's that?

00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:05.194
I sprained a ligament,
so I have to be in a cast for two weeks.

00:52:11.209 --> 00:52:12.789
Gosh...

00:52:12.789 --> 00:52:14.291
Wasn't that from the bathroom?

00:52:14.291 --> 00:52:15.584
Why did you...

00:52:15.584 --> 00:52:17.990
Why did you just leave the baby with me?

00:52:20.923 --> 00:52:22.449
Come on. Let's go.

00:52:26.975 --> 00:52:28.639
Just leave him.

00:52:28.639 --> 00:52:30.206
I'll do it.

00:53:00.101 --> 00:53:01.560
Hyun Jin.

00:53:19.594 --> 00:53:20.720
Why aren't you eating?

00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:22.261
Go on, eat.

00:53:25.195 --> 00:53:27.128
This is really hard on you, isn't it?

00:53:31.868 --> 00:53:33.394
Yeah.

00:53:34.413 --> 00:53:35.872
Still...

00:53:35.872 --> 00:53:39.543
it's a little easier not having to stand
as chief mourner alone.

00:53:39.543 --> 00:53:41.169
Is that the in-law you mentioned before?

00:53:41.169 --> 00:53:43.040
- The Pimang guy?
- Yeah.

00:53:46.091 --> 00:53:47.951
Has he been helping a lot?

00:53:48.552 --> 00:53:49.594
Yeah.

00:53:49.594 --> 00:53:51.304
When I got back from the hospital,

00:53:51.304 --> 00:53:55.017
he'd already picked out
the burial clothes and the urn.

00:53:55.017 --> 00:53:57.310
He even chose my sister's coffin.

00:53:57.310 --> 00:53:59.563
I don't really know any of this stuff.

00:53:59.563 --> 00:54:01.756
I guess that's a relief, right?

00:54:01.756 --> 00:54:02.808
Oh, right.

00:54:02.808 --> 00:54:04.818
Why is your arm hurt all of a sudden?

00:54:04.818 --> 00:54:06.445
That too...

00:54:06.445 --> 00:54:08.321
because of him.

00:54:08.321 --> 00:54:11.324
I got a cast as soon as
I came to the funeral hall,

00:54:11.324 --> 00:54:12.981
my arm hurts,

00:54:14.174 --> 00:54:16.212
my head's all over the place.

00:54:16.212 --> 00:54:17.992
None of this feels real.

00:54:20.459 --> 00:54:23.153
You're not okay at all.

00:54:24.376 --> 00:54:25.777
It's just...

00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:29.784
I can't believe my sister is

00:54:30.635 --> 00:54:32.488
in that memorial photo.

00:54:34.014 --> 00:54:37.434
It feels like if I went home right now,

00:54:37.434 --> 00:54:38.924
she'd be there.

00:54:40.437 --> 00:54:42.213
Maybe that's why.

00:54:42.856 --> 00:54:44.749
It just doesn't feel real.

00:56:19.828 --> 00:56:21.104
As you know,

00:56:21.104 --> 00:56:23.957
Woo Joo currently has no legal guardian.

00:56:23.957 --> 00:56:27.622
If neither of you is willing to take him in,

00:56:27.622 --> 00:56:29.928
he'll be placed in a care facility.

00:56:30.655 --> 00:56:31.907
Since

00:56:31.907 --> 00:56:35.810
you're both his closest relatives,

00:56:35.810 --> 00:56:39.084
we need to decide which of you will raise him.

00:56:40.932 --> 00:56:43.602
So now you're asking me this too?

00:56:43.602 --> 00:56:45.979
I just spent three days deciding
whether to serve thirty portions of yukgaejang,

00:56:45.979 --> 00:56:48.162
whether the burial clothes
should be hemp or a cotton blend,

00:56:48.162 --> 00:56:50.460
even the shape of the coffin handles

00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:52.235
and the thank-you gifts for mourners.

00:56:52.235 --> 00:56:53.653
I answered all of that.

00:56:53.653 --> 00:56:55.313
But why are you asking me about a kid?

00:56:55.313 --> 00:56:57.715
I only met him for the first time here.

00:56:59.910 --> 00:57:02.704
I'm not someone
who can take responsibility for anyone.

00:57:02.704 --> 00:57:05.917
And I'm done being involved with Sun Woo Jin.

00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:35.808
I'll raise him.

00:57:35.808 --> 00:57:37.762
I'll take care of Woo Joo.

00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:06.226
This is the last thing I'll do.

00:58:06.226 --> 00:58:08.319
Let's not see each other again.

00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:11.243
I don't expect we'll ever be involved again.

00:58:12.018 --> 00:58:13.441
Take care.

00:58:13.441 --> 00:58:15.321
And raise the kid well.

00:58:16.194 --> 00:58:18.214
I hope you recover soon.

00:58:19.364 --> 00:58:21.030
Hey, little one.

00:58:21.638 --> 00:58:23.748
Let's never see each other again.

00:58:27.539 --> 00:58:29.912
Here. This is my last gift.

00:58:45.274 --> 00:58:46.933
Woo Joo,

00:58:46.933 --> 00:58:48.659
Let's go home.

00:59:30.619 --> 00:59:33.304
I'm going to live well with Woo Joo.

00:59:33.304 --> 00:59:35.037
Let's eat.

00:59:36.486 --> 00:59:38.133
What is this place...

00:59:38.133 --> 00:59:40.083
How are you supposed to do this
all on your own?

00:59:40.083 --> 00:59:41.941
I'm going to pass, no matter what,

00:59:41.941 --> 00:59:44.377
and raise Woo Joo without him lacking anything.

00:59:45.816 --> 00:59:46.880
Please help!

00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:48.217
I'm going to give up Woo Joo.

00:59:48.217 --> 00:59:49.744
Daddy?

00:59:49.744 --> 00:59:50.768
Take him. Now.

00:59:50.768 --> 00:59:52.047
I'm done. We're cut off.

00:59:52.047 --> 00:59:53.588
You don't get to decide that on your own.

00:59:53.588 --> 00:59:55.084
We...

00:59:56.063 --> 00:59:58.303
We've already crossed that line.
