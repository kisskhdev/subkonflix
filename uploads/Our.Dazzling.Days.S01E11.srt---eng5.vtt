Wait, what about the snowman and this...

Can we give him the snacks?

Sirs...

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:33.510
Just leave.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:35.270
Did they hear it clearly inside?

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:36.120
Go back now.

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:37.200
Hurry and leave.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.030
-Take care.
-Be careful.

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:49.070
They're just kids.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:53.750
Tie that tape recorder tight.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.080
Take it slow on your way.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.080
Yes, sirs.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:58.510
-Press... Turn it on.
-Sirs, goodbye.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:08:58.870
Ride slowly.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:08:59.730
Sirs, goodbye.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.390

-Hurry, let's go.
-It's on again!

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:03.840

Go back home.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:20.320
Let's go play it in the back.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.760
Put it here, here.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:22.870
Let's put it in the middle.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:23.510
Yeah.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.400

Xiaodan, you've got to try this.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.240
My husband cooked these pig trotters
especially for you.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.080
Okay. Thank you, Mrs. Tong.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:47.670
Let me try.

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:49.480
Eat a trotter,
and you'll grab success in Shanghai.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.210
-Here.
-Yes.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:50.870
Grab success.

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:51.410
Lei.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.930
It's so good. Mr. Xia is a great cook.

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:53.440
Hurry.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:54.140
Come on.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:54.970
Let me serve you some.

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:55.720
Thank you, madam.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.650
Look at Xiaodan.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.080
We watched her grow up.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:58.910
Now that she's leaving,

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:00.970
I don't know when we'll see her again.

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:02.270
What are you saying?

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.640
Isn't your Lei going to Shanghai, too?

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:05.440
They will

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.630
keep in touch anyway.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:07.240
Yes, yes.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.320
Just knowing

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:12.270
we have old friends like you in Shanghai

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.670
makes us feel much more at ease.

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:14.150
Yes.

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:15.110
You know,

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.040
well, all these years,

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.440
we've been preparing for this day.

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:20.770
But now that it's come,

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:24.270
I feel so empty inside.

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:25.730
-I'm a bit sad to let go.
-He's feeling melancholy.

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.910
Come on. You have to let go,
even if you're reluctant to,

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:28.720
as a parent.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.270
Yes, yes.

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:30.030
What do we want?

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.120
It's all for the children.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.000
-Exactly.
-Yeah.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.440
Excellent! In the future,

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.270
you two should study hard, right?

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:36.320
Get into a good workplace

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.960
-No...
-and have a bright future.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.270
They'll be great entrepreneurs!

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:40.080
Right?

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.480
Isn't that what you think, too?

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:43.910
Yes.

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:45.890
I've been looking forward to this day.

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:47.050
You may not know.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.030
A couple of days ago,

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:48.870
his plant held

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:51.320
a farewell party for Yan.

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:53.390
Everything was fine at first,

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:56.030
but Zhuang Dalin
insisted on calling Yan a deserter

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:57.080
and talking nonsense.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.440
I didn't even want to listen.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.840
Later, Yan didn't say a word
in his defense.

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:02.240
Once the transfer order came,

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.080
he walked around the plant

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.320
for a whole day

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:06.720
without even coming back for dinner.
(Shanghai dialect)

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.320
What?

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:08.680
What do you mean?

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:10.670
He didn't come back for dinner.

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:11.210
Geez.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.120
It's okay.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.440
How disheartening.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.720
Yeah.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:19.340
We've been here for most of our lives.

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:21.320
How could we not have feelings
for this place?

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:21.780
Indeed.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.360
Why are we going through

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.270
the trouble of moving back

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:25.480
at our age?

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:27.240
It's for our daughter.

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:28.550
For the kid.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.440
You should just ignore... ignore them.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:31.870
Right.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:33.510
Chief Engineer Yan
has put his heart and soul

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:35.720
into the plant all these years.

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.270
-Everyone knows that.
-We all know.

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:38.790
Exactly.

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:41.480
It's understandable
that you're planning for your child.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.010
Isn't it?

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.580
Let's forget about it.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:45.150
Lei,

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:48.380
you're going to Shanghai soon, right?

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:50.590
My wife and I will be in Shanghai.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:51.510
We'll be there.

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:54.360
Well, just see our home as your home.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.640
Come over whenever you're free.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.510
My wife will cook whatever you want.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:12:59.020
Do you hear me?

00:12:59.020 --> 00:12:59.450
Okay.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.870
I'd like to thank you, Chief Engineer Yan,
on behalf of Xia Lei.

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:03.360
Cheers, Mr. Yan.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:03.720
Cheers.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.780
Let's have a drink.

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:06.160
Chief Engineer Yan.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.460
Shanghai is your home,

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.910
but East Chemical Plant is also your home.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:09.390
Yes.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.840
Come back whenever you miss us.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.380
I will always have

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:15.640
a hearty family meal

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:16.720
ready for you.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:19.120
Come on, let's drink together.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:19.840
Together!

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:20.910
You two...

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.440
-Good luck at school.
-Today's kids are so nice.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:22.960
Really.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.680
Wish you all the best.

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:27.040
Xiaoman,

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:30.030
while writing this letter to you,

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.370
I couldn't help wondering

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:34.630
what you are doing right now.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:36.870
The other day,

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:39.800
Xia Lei and I
tried every possible means to visit you,

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.120
but we failed.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.300
Looking at the high walls,

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.200
I felt so sad thinking

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:47.550
that you were trapped inside

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:49.440
because of me.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.910
On August 20th,

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.910
Xia Lei and I played "Really Love You"

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:56.120
outside the walls.

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:58.440
I wonder if you heard it.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.040
When the song played,

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:03.270
I remembered how you looked

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:04.800
singing this song on stage.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:07.200
You were so dazzling and handsome.

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:10.320
It also brought back
many amazing memories.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.960
Six months will go by quickly.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.400
Take good care of yourself in there.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.000
Hope when I see you again,

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.840
you'll still be that shining,
high-spirited Zhang Xiaoman.

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:27.630
I'm leaving our plant today

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:29.560
for the school in Shanghai.

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:31.660
I got
into the Architectural Design program

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.060
at Tongzhou University.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.440
The thought of unfamiliar university life

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:38.560
makes me both curious and nervous.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.920
But I know that wherever my ship sails,

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:43.940
my first mate will never leave,

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:47.200
so I am full of courage
for the unknown ahead.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:48.600
Xiaoman,

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.620
I look forward to seeing you again

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.370
and exploring our future together.

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:59.720
We share the cold waves, the wind,
the thunder, and the lightning.

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:04.550
We share the mist,
the drifting clouds, and the rainbow.

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:07.920
We could be temporarily apart,

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:11.360
yet bound together for life.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.040
From Xiaodan.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:26.530
[East Integrated Chemical Plant]

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.220
Do you like this color?

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.580

All right.
Now that you know where we live,

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:30.270
feel free to come visit us
whenever you want.

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:31.730
Got it. Thank you, Mr. Yan.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.640
I'll definitely visit you
whenever I have time.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:34.030
Good.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:37.110
Mom, let me help you.

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:38.930
Don't bother. You guys chat.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:41.830
Guoqing,

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:44.790
you are very welcome to visit our home.

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.410
Xiaodan just arrived in Shanghai,

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:48.960
and she doesn't have many friends here.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.650
Please

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.370
take good care of her, okay?

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.530
Don't worry, ma'am.

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:54.680
If she needs help in the future,

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:55.720
I'll do my best as long as it's

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:56.510
within my capabilities.

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:57.270
Okay, great.

00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:59.910
Sweetie, say thank you to Guoqing.

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.080
Is it really necessary?

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:04.690
Aren't my dad and his dad old classmates?

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.590
Senior Chen and I are classmates, too.

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:08.770
We're just continuing that friendship.

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:09.570
That's right.

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:10.330
She's right.

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:12.770
Sweetie, you do have a way with words.

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:15.100
Come on, help me peel some apples.

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:20.680
Guoqing.

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.400
I have a question for you.

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:25.670
Do you have a girlfriend?

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.020
I don't have a girlfriend now.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.120
Oh, no girlfriend?

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:31.960
You're so outstanding, Guoqing.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:35.160
You must pick carefully
when finding a girlfriend.

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:36.680
You and Xiaodan are

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.240
in the same school.

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:40.050
-You can help each other.
-Alright, enough.

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:40.700
Look at you.

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:42.940
You're embarrassing the kid.

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.310
[Shanghai Tongzhou University]

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:44.350
That's nothing.

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:49.640
Back in high school,
I always dreamed of skipping class.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:50.720
Now it's great.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.400
I'm not used

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.000
to the sharp drop in classes.

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:55.630
Then you can sit in on classes
at other schools.

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.280
Won't the teachers mind?

00:23:58.030 --> 00:23:59.720
We'll take classes together.

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:01.200
Several classes are combined,

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.930
and nobody knows anybody else.

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:05.840
Then that's a good idea.

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:08.400
I'll look up classes
at the School of Arts later.

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.850
Actually, small classes are nice too.

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:10.720
Because teachers

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.120
really welcome other students sitting in.

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:16.180
Meng Ge, long time no see!

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:18.360
You've grown taller again?

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:18.920
What?

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:21.240
Let me introduce you.

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.550
This is my high school classmate, Meng Ge.

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:25.030
This is my senior, Chen Guoqing.

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:25.480
Hello.

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.240
Hello.

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:28.240
Since your friend is here for you,

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.370
I'll leave you to it.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.910
If you need any help at school,
just come to me.

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:33.200
Okay. Thank you, Senior Chen.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.270
I'm off. Bye-bye.

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:34.880
Bye-bye.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:35.760
Bye-bye, miss.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:38.680
Look.

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.300
-Wait.
-Look at the library.

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:41.110
What's wrong?

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:42.240
Is he pursuing you?

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:45.400
What? No way.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.550
His dad and my dad are old classmates.

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:49.010
They've known each other.

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:49.900
Really?

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:52.400
Can we drop it?

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.760
Let's talk about you.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.930
Where did you get into?

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:56.880
Shanghai Huadong?

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.400
So you don't even remember.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.400
Huadong University
of Finance and Economics.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:24:59.960
Right.

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:01.840
Xia Lei is at Shanghai Huigong.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:02.830
Your schools are so close.

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:03.890
Haven't you met up?

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:05.360
I didn't even know that.

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:07.970
So you still care about me,

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.430
coming all this way just to see me.

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:12.530
You bet.

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:15.040
Alright. I'll treat you at the cafeteria.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:22.680
Here we go.

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:24.950
This is yours.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:27.960
Honestly, I

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:30.590
really wanted to treat you
to my hometown dishes.

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:31.880
But what are these?

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:35.280
Another day of missing Mr. Xia's cooking.

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:37.870
By the way,

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:41.600
why did you decide
to apply to a school in Shanghai?

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.060
I wanted to study finance.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.740
You never mentioned that in high school.

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:49.270
I thought you would
either go back to Beijing

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:50.000
or go abroad.

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:52.720
I didn't expect you to come to Shanghai
to study finance

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.070
and deal with math.

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:57.030
Just hearing the word "math"
gives me a headache.

00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:59.350
I think interpersonal relationships
give me a bigger headache.

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:00.480
Social etiquette

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:03.110
always makes me feel rather bewildered.

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:05.020
I think numbers are clear-cut.

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:06.320
Dealing with numbers is

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.850
actually quite rewarding.

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:13.270
I always knew you had a clear head,

00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:15.750
but I didn't expect it to be this clear.

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:17.810
You've got it all figured out as well.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.550
Back in high school,
given those recitation contests

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:22.480
and the hosting competitions
you participated in,

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.480
I thought you

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:25.810
didn't take your studies seriously.

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:29.110
But you ended up
in Tongzhou's architecture program.

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:33.350
Actually, when I set my goal,

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.720
I also didn't have much confidence.

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:37.830
Then, after what happened to Xiaoman,

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:39.890
I studied like crazy for a few months.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.070
My additional art test scores were
pretty good.

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:45.270
Guess I had a bit of luck on my side.

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.170
Is Xiaoman getting released soon?

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:55.750
October 18th.

00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:59.240
[One month later]

00:26:59.240 --> 00:26:59.800
Honey.

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:02.790
I've prepped all the ingredients.

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:04.120
I'm leaving this to you.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.350
I have to... I've got to go now.

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:06.200
Leave the soup alone.

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:06.590
I see.

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:07.240
I'll finish it when I'm back.

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.270
I need... I need

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:09.440
to add the egg drop on top.

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.720
You've got everything else done?

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:11.980
Just the egg drop left.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.000
Who is it?

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:23.240
Ding?

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:24.810
Yan!

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:27.920
Is today the day to pick up Xiaoman?

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.270
Yes. I'm

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.720
just about to go get him.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:32.920
Don't get me started.

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:33.930
Xiaodan

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.400
insisted on taking a train ride
that lasts dozens of hours,

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.030
saying that she wanted to go back
and pick him up herself.

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:40.720
Her mom and I spent ages
persuading her not to.

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.610
Yeah, they're close.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.000
Actually, I also think

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:50.350
there's really no need for that.

00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:51.080
The reason is

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:55.240
that if Xiaodan and Xia Lei
do well in class in Shanghai

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:57.170
and focus on their studies, I guess

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.000
Xiaoman will be quite happy.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.830
Xiaodan just got here.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.070
I think it'll take her some time

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:06.790
to adapt to this new environment,

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:08.240
whether it's life

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.900
or the academic environment.

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.200
Sometimes I'm worried, too.

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.400
I'm afraid Xiaoman might distract her.

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.030
So what?

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:21.750
Your kid is a treasure,

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:22.950
but is ours any worse?

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.440
Don't... Don't get mad.

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:26.160
That's not what I meant.

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:30.690
Let's analyze
the reality objectively, right?

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.270
Xiaodan has made it out, after all.

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:36.500
There's no way
I'll let her go back to the mountains.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.400
As for what's between the two kids,

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.240
we adults are well aware of it.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.660
Tell me yourself.
Do you think they have a future together?

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:46.030
Your kid is 18 now,
even if she's unsettled!

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:48.160
Let the kids solve their own problems.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.110
What's with the shouting? What's going on?

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:52.590
What?

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:54.920
Like our kid is shameless or something...

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:57.990
Who was it?

00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:00.390
Go out for a bit.
I have something to handle.

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.550
Zhang Xiaoman, come out with me.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.400
I'm off.

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:23.440
Bye.

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:29.790
Officer.

00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:32.470
Xiaoman,

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.200
after you leave,

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:35.780
I won't get a taste of honey.

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:44.790
You keep it.

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:45.860
Take it.

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:47.120
Really?

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:48.950
Keep growing it here.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:50.980
It looks quite festive

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:52.860
in the room.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.590
Remember to water it.

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.720
Don't... Don't water it too much, though.

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.850
Overwatering will kill it instantly.

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:03.440
Do you hear me?

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:04.240
Yeah, I got it.

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.790
Listen, if you kill it,

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.500
I'll deal with you.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:08.850
Are you coming back?

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.620
Won't you get out eventually?

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.370
You're in your teens.

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:15.430
Don't cause trouble when you get out.

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.400
Don't worry.

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:18.100
Let's go, Zhang Xiaoman.

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:18.580
Okay.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.170
I'm leaving.

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:21.550
Behave yourself.

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.300
Alright, I'm taking my leave.

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:26.510
Get out. Don't look back.

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:28.400
Thank you, Officer.

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:28.830
Okay.

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:32.500
Off you go.

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:34.780
Thank you.

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:44.590
Mr. Ding.

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:50.400
I was planning

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.600
to use some mugwort
to sweep away your bad luck.

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.640
But my wife said juvenile detention

00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:58.360
doesn't count as jailing,

00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:59.370
so let's skip it.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.090
You've lost weight.

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:07.810
Being thin is fine.

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.930
You've grown taller again.

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:12.550
Come on, let's go. Get in the car.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:13.640
Let's go home.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:14.920
I'll get you cleaned up first.

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:15.890
You have a car now?

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:16.610
Let's go.

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:19.390
Excuse me.

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:20.620
Sorry to trouble you, sir.

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:21.750
Please take us back.

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:22.490
Thank you.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.240
Come on.

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:27.830
Get in.

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:30.100
Watch your leg.

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:31.400
You sit in the front?

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:31.990
Yeah.

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:46.500
Xiaoman is back.

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:47.240
Yeah, he's back.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:47.680
Okay.

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:51.920
Why are you following behind me?

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:52.780
Are you my tail?

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:54.350
You are educated.

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:55.720
You aren't... You are good people.

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:56.400
Hold your head up.

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.460
Walk in front of me.

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:04.920
Mr. Ding!

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.350
Xiaoman!

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.130
You're back.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:07.640
Yeah.

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:09.420
Father and son are here.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:10.240
Your ticket.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:10.920
Give us one key.

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:11.550
I'm not bathing.

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:12.160
Take it.

00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:13.450
Go ahead.

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.790
Say hello. This is...

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:15.920
Mr. Li and Mr. Zhang.

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:16.970
Mr. Li, Mr. Zhang.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.750
The water is great today.

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:19.660
Go in and wash up.

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:20.080
Go ahead.

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:20.970
He's a good kid.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:21.400
Go on.

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:22.420
-Good boy.
-Go in.

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:26.250
Washing up?

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.840
Mr. Ding.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:27.920
What number? 4.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.030
Four is here, this way.

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:29.590
Don't just talk.

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:31.200
When have you ever treated me to a drink?

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.110
I promise I'll treat you this time.

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:33.370
Do something for real.

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:36.820
Gosh, I dropped it.

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:38.170
Here is the soap

00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:39.100
and the shampoo.

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:41.760
Take them off.

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:44.240
Take the clothes off and throw them away.

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.300
Let's start fresh.

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:46.900
I brought you a new set.

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:00.890
Put on the slippers.

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:01.350
Come on.

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:03.780
Take off

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:05.390
a-and throw away your socks.

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:06.650
Give them to me.

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:08.140
Throw away the socks, too?

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:09.240
Why would you keep them?

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:10.970
No need. T-Throw them all away.

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.920
We have new ones.

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.070
Go ahead.

00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:17.240
Take this basket with you.

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.000
Change into this when you come out.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.400
C-Change into this later!

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.300
Oh, my...
Have you never taken a shower before?

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:22.830
Go.

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:27.240
Get in! I'll wait for you.

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:28.370
I'm not washing. Go.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.500
Clean yourself up!

00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:57.960
Mr. Ding.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:03.820
I'm g-going to my grandma's place
to take a look.

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:07.420
As you should.

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:09.020
Go ahead. I'll wait for you.

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:10.090
Are you staying here?

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:11.000
You go ahead.

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:39.710
Where are the bowls and chopsticks?
Hurry up.

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:40.630
Coming.

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:43.989
Here you are.

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:45.690
Enjoy the food.

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:48.770
You've lost weight.

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:50.360
Haven't you?

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:51.840
The kid's lost weight.

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:53.670
But he looks energetic.

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.760
That's good.

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:56.550
Eat up.

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:59.020
Ding made these meat dishes just for you.

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:01.550
Eat whatever you like. Have plenty.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:02.630
Um...

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:04.630
Mr. Ding, Mrs. Ding.

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.840
I've caused trouble for everyone
because of this case.

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:11.670
I'm sorry.

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:13.610
What is this kid talking about?

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:14.970
What did I just tell you?

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:16.150
Don't be afraid of falling.

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:17.800
Get back up, and you're still a man.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:18.550
Exactly.

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.030
It wasn't a huge mistake.

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:21.760
What? Well, you're also wrong about it.

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:22.760
How am I wrong?

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:24.040
A mistake is a mistake.

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:25.730
The part that wasn't wrong is separate.

00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:26.550
You have to tell them apart.

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:28.010
His intentions were good.

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:29.830
Yes, right. Good intentions.

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.590
You were doing it
for our plant's safety, weren't you?

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:34.450
Your heart was in the right place.

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:36.000
Come on, eat up.

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:37.110
Dig in.

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:39.140
Eat to your heart's content.

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.540
I just remembered something.

00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:42.710
On my way back,

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:44.150
I ran into Xia Lei's mother.

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:45.030
She said

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:47.490
Xia Lei and Xiaodan are going to call you.

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.960
When?

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:50.850
She said after dinner.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:51.790
Around 8.

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:53.910
Let's eat. Hurry up.

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:56.420
I'll wait here then. Perfect timing.

00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:57.790
Just wait.

00:35:58.880 --> 00:35:59.630
Eat more.

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:01.100
Look at him.

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:02.440
He got so happy

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:04.320
as soon as he heard about the call.

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:04.970
Happy?

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.840
How can you tell that he's happy?

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:08.480
You're always talking nonsense.

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:09.340
Isn't he happy?

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:10.030
He looks happy to me.

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:10.830
Are you happy?

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:11.960
Even I'm happy.

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.160
Do... Do you want a drink?

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:15.670
Come on, hurry up!

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:16.630
It's almost 8:30.

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:17.760
Where have you been?

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:19.940
Class ran late tonight.

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:21.910
The teacher didn't let us go.

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:24.390
Wait, how many cards do you have?

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:26.000
Let me see.

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:27.260
I have two of 30.

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:29.480
There's 20 yuan left on this card.

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.590
I only called home once this month,

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:32.990
just to save it for today.

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:34.670
Brilliant. Look.

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:37.230
I haven't used this one of 50
and these two of 30.

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:38.420
We can talk all night.

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:39.010
Good.

00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:39.800
Perfect.

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:40.880
Hurry.

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.800
Well, call Mr. Ding.

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:46.360
My mom said
they're all at his place today.

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:47.390
Okay.

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:04.360
It can't go through.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:05.880
Why?

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.110
Let me try.

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:10.290
Is the phone malfunctioning?

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.800
Why does it have to malfunction now?

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:16.880
Do you remember those comrades of mine?

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:17.480
I do.

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.360
Those same few guys.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:20.590
Gu Yonghua.

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:22.160
Cao Li.

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.720
Ma Leizi.

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:23.280
Ma Leizi.

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:29.550
It's really not working.

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.010
It won't go through?

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:34.760
What should we do then?

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:39.760
Well, can you believe that?

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:41.480
Getting married is

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:43.030
a serious matter.

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:44.710
What's going on?

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:47.450
What's the date today?

00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:49.230
Xiaoman was supposed to be released today.

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:51.230
Yeah. Then why aren't they
answering the phone?

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:52.670
Well, I mean, you shouldn't

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:54.330
take feelings too seriously.

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:55.910
How can you not take them seriously?

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:56.670
Xiaoman, Xiaoman.

00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:57.930
Do you think I'm right?

00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:59.220
You're right.

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:00.230
-Right about what?
-Yes.

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:01.760
People need to be faithful, don't they?

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:02.880
Is Master Ding right?

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.480
Master Ding is wrong.

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.000
See?

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:05.550
One minute you say I'm right,

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:06.480
the next you say I'm wrong.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.360
Are you even listening?

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.420
Are you listening?

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:11.060
What are you talking about?

00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:12.440
I know, boy.

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:13.800
He's spacing out.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.250
Y-You're waiting
for their call, aren't you?

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:16.560
Well, w-weren't they
supposed to call at 8?

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:17.000
Yes.

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:18.230
It's already 8... 8:30 now.

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.830
It's fine.

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.510
Maybe they're having

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:22.450
extra classes.

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:24.490
Just like Mr. Ding working overtime.

00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:26.440
Stop blabbering. Cut it out... I...

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:27.480
I go to work to earn money.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:28.440
Do they make money at school?

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:29.480
It's not the case of working overtime.

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:30.150
Well, they love studying.

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:31.000
Cut it out if you don't get it.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.750
So how do you know
the class didn't run late?

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:34.880
There's a time difference
between Shanghai and here.

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:35.480
That's it.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:36.340
Really?

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:37.880
-I need to use the bathroom.
-There's time difference?

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:39.670
We are thousands of miles apart.

00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:40.670
Maybe he's right.

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.790
Maybe there's a time difference,

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:44.190
like half an hour or what.

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:45.800
Just wait a bit longer.

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:46.860
Drink some of this.

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.480
And eat Mr. Ding's pancake.

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:49.930
Is the phone s-still in the inner room?

00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:50.410
Yeah.

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:52.000
I... I'll call Xia Lei.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.000
Go ahead and call.

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.230
It's right by the bed.

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:55.160
Call and ask him.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.570
Why didn't you call?

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:21.070
I'm going for a walk with Mr. Ding.

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:22.170
I'll go down and check.

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:23.510
-He's been gone for a while.
-Is it cold outside?

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:24.310
No. It's fine.

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:32.360
Xiaoman.

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:34.990
I have a question for you.

00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:36.520
You're 18 this year, right?

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:38.230
Technically speaking,

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:40.230
you can drink now. Have some.

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.970
Mr. Ding, why did you unplug the phone?

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:48.590
What... What?

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:50.320
I don't know.

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:51.470
What happened?

00:39:55.070 --> 00:39:56.070
Mr. Ding, I know.

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:59.070
y-you must've done this for my own good.

00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:00.710
But I want

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:01.510
to know why.

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:14.940
Boy, I won't keep it from you anymore.

00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:18.100
I scolded Yan today.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:19.800
What did he do?

00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:21.070
Why did you scold him?

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:22.150
What e-else

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:23.230
does he need to do

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:24.290
for me to scold him?

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:25.930
Only a child needs coaxing.

00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:28.000
I just scolded him casually. So what?

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:34.630
Like you're throwing yourself at him!

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:36.590
Are we so thick-skinned?

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:47.220
Mr. Ding.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.280
Well,

00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:52.670
Xiaodan

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.940
and the others
all went to Shanghai for college.

00:40:57.070 --> 00:40:59.330
Do they think I'm not good enough for her?

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:03.030
You wimp.

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.250
Truly hopeless.

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:07.000
Look at yourself.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:07.880
Go look in the mirror anytime.

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:08.320
Look at you.

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:09.510
W-With this height,

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:11.000
standing here like a solid rock,

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.600
and your looks, you still...

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:22.070
No matter how things go

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.710
between you and Xiaodan...

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:25.710
I-I don't know...

00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:27.110
But I-I don't care.

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:29.190
But in my heart,

00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:32.200
you are the best.

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:33.840
No one beats you.

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:36.110
Bar none.

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:37.180
Top notch.

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.180
Do you understand?

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:43.720
If you do, let's go drink.

00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:44.360
Let's go.

00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:45.480
Let's go home.

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:46.980
Why are you holding me?

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:48.170
I'm... I'm fine.

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:49.040
Let's go.

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:50.760
Let's go for a drink.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000
You're an 18-year-old man now...

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:56.410
It's no big deal.

00:41:58.510 --> 00:41:59.170
Be careful.

00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:00.290
You mind the step.

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.880
He...

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:03.450
Did anything happen to him?

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:06.230
Could something have happened again?

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:07.630
So he was not released today?

00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:08.430
No, no way.

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:11.090
How about this?

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:12.840
I'll call home tomorrow.

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:14.070
I'll ask them

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.890
to bring Xiaoman to my place on Sunday.

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:17.800
We can call again then.

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:20.070
Okay. He should be fine, right?

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:21.960
Don't worry.

00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:26.390
There's something
called probability theory.

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:27.400
For example,

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.070
we encounter certain things in a day.

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:31.180
Like what?

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:33.480
One person

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:34.920
might meet

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:37.280
another person twice in a day.

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:39.400
These are all low-probability events,

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:40.710
so you don't need to worry.

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:41.710
Alright.

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:44.440
I thought I could

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:46.070
hear Xiaoman's voice today.

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:50.650
Go back and hit the sack.

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.580
You go back early, too.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.530
Keep yours. Don't lose them.

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:00.260
Of course.

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:02.440
Let's call him next time. I'm off.

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:03.100
Goodnight.

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:03.840
Goodnight.
