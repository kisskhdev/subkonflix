[Duang, did you head out yet?]

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.080
Please excuse me.

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:24.880
Have you ever fallen in love
at first sight?

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.860
I didn't believe it was real.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.800
I thought it was just a quote
everyone uses.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.120
How could a single glance
change someone's life?

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.720
But now it's happening to me,

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.039
without any warning.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.560
It feels like I'm under a spell,

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.600
like I was pushed into a deep hole,

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.320
knowing... (Support Admin Watch on

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.360
I might not be able to climb back out.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.320
Even so,

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.160
if it's for him,

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.259
I'm willing to make myself
ready in every way

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.800
just to love him.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.200
Damn, he's so cute!

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.120
Hey,

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.520
you see that bush?

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.600
That one.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.160
Yo, Jamie.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.040
Hey, Pae.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.280
Hey,

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.920
you can't say hi
to your friends, can you?

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.280
That's not nice.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.720
That's not nice.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.240
Exactly. That's not very nice.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.600
Fine.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.360
Get this, you jerks!

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.120
What jerks?

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.320
Did you mean jerk chicken?

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.000
Or beef jerky?

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.760
- Give it back.
- Nope.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.640
Hey, Pae.

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.200
Give it to me!

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.680
I bet it's Avenjerks.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.520
Avenjerks.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.440
- The hell are you talking about?
- Oh...

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.000
The Avengers, you know?

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.000
The Avengers...

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.600
Like this.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.560
Shit!

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.680
That's freaking genius!

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.760
Don't make that joke again.
It didn't land.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.520
My bag!

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.400
Hey, stop!

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.840
Stop!

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.280
You'd better watch out.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.840
Freedom comes at a high price,

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.840
but it's a price
I'm willing to pay, sir.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.520
That's right, Captain!

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.760
Let's go!

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.160
Why are you just standing there?

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.720
Please move.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.200
Hey, Qin.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.360
Have you eaten yet?

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.200
I have.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.640
Wait, so I'm the only one
who hasn't eaten yet?

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.640
You came unprepared, Tong.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.680
Come on, man.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.240
Last semester, we would eat together
at that cafeteria over there.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.520
We still have half an hour
before class.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:13.720
Stop rambling already.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.000
If you want us to go with you,
just say so.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.720
So...

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.440
go to the cafeteria with me, okay?

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.360
I'll let Qin decide.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:23.840
What?

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.800
Come on, you coming or not?

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.560
Fine, I am.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.320
Great.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.960
That's my bros. You're my BFFs.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Let's go.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.920
Gotcha.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.920
Captain and his spider sidekick, huh?

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:46.960
You'd better get that.

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:48.120
What did you say?

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:51.159
"Freedom comes at a high price."

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.080
How much?

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.120
I'll wire you the money, professor.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:57.310
That's not funny.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.800
Do your work.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Jeez.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.880
Assholes.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.480
Hey,

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.760
Freshy Night is tonight.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.640
I'm definitely going.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.200
I didn't ask.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.760
Well, I'll go anyway.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.840
You know, Freshy Night is basically
where all the warriors gather.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.000
Sorry.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.320
This semester just began,
and you've already been to battles.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.560
Seriously, how many people now?

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.440
Warriors don't keep score, you know.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.280
They call it experience.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.440
Hey, warrior.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.560
I just ran into this guy,

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.360
and he's so damn cute.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.320
Who is he?

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.240
His name is Qin.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.280
He's from the College of Music.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.000
Okay.

00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:55.159
And?

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.680
That's all I know.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.280
Come on.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.400
That's all you know,

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.840
and you kept me waiting, huh?

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.960
At least I know something.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.520
But hey,

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.880
if he's a freshman,

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.000
he's gotta go to Freshy Night tonight
no matter what.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.760
So what time does it start?

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:14.920
6 P.M.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:15.960
I'm coming.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:16.760
You?

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.680
Fine.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.280
What does that mean?

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.640
Fine, I'm coming, too.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.480
It's battle time.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.680
- Yay!
- Yay!

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.360
Wow, let's battle.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.520
Damn it.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.039
What's your problem?

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.320
Why aren't you working?

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:36.960
How many times do I have to tell you?

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.880
I've walked around the room,
and you still haven't drawn a thing.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.000
No work done, no battle for you.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:43.840
You're staying here
polishing your sword.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.240
Get to work.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.600
Go make a podcast or something
if you wanna talk so much.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:12.960
Whoa...

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.840
This is incredible.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.640
This isn't fun.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:43.840
I'm out.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.720
What? What do you mean?

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.000
It hasn't even started yet.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:47.840
Right.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.480
You were craning your neck
like a total giraffe.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.360
Did you see anything?

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.280
Come on,

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:54.920
he's definitely not coming.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.120
I'd rather leave.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.360
Oh, come on.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.960
♫We might have walked past, unaware,♫

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.640
♫On days you had someone else there♫

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:46.480

♫Not knowing you were standing there♫

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:52.760
Is that your Qin?

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.680
Yeah.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.480
Damn, he's so fine.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.080
Shut it. I wanna listen to him.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:57.920
Duang,

00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.840
your expectations
are way too high, man.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.520
Hey, look at your plane.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.160
- Now bark at it.
- Come on, bark.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:03.960
Bark at the plane.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.080
Or you can howl.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.960
Go away.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:11.920
Please excuse me.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:16.360

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.960
I still can't believe
Qin actually agreed to go on stage.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.840
With the way they talked to him...

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.560
He was basically forced.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.440
Aw, he was forced to come.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:29.720
I heard that, too.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:38.920

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.440
Hey,

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.280
you're this close to the stage?

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.680
Guys, this is the guy
I've been looking for.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:54.960
A jazz major. Freshman.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Oh, so you know him now?

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.680
If that's all you know,
then I know him, too.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.840
They literally announced it.
Everyone here knows him.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.720
And so do I.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.680
"Please give it up for our singer,

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:08.120
Qin, a first-year jazz major."

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.080
I like him.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.160
- What?
- What?

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:18.720
Hey.

There's another one.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.760
But this is the last room.

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.400
If he's not here, I'll be so bummed.

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:01.720
He's in there.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:02.880
Wait, for real?

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.360
- Oh...
- Shit.

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.560
Is everything okay?

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:10.800
Where's the restroom?

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:12.880
- The restroom?
- Yes.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:13.920
Over there.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.400
- Oh, let's go.
- Okay.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:16.400
Come on.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.240
Hey,

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.320
cut through this room.
It's much faster.

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.120
It's...

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.680
It's okay.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:25.800
No, it's fine.

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:27.060
Or...

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.200
are you actually here for someone?

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.800
We can go through your room.

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.080
We can do that.

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.200
Please. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:39.680
It's nothing.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:40.880
Come on.

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:01.680
Hey, Qin,

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.880
are those guys...

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.920
the ones that have been
tailing you all day?

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:08.320
More fans of yours?

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.560
Damn, this time they even followed you
to the practice room.

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:13.360
Let's just practice.

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.520
Hey, Duang.

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:32.240
How could you even ask,
"Where's the restroom?"

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:33.640
I learned that from dramas.

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.240
It's your fault.

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.760
We almost got screwed because of you.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:38.800
Right.

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.640
What do you think Qin will feel?

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.320
What will he think of me?

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.880
- I don't know, man.
- Yeah.

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.120
Don't overthink it.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.960
You're not that outstanding anyway.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:47.880
I know.

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.680
But I accidentally
liked one of his pics last night.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:54.800
You idiot!

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.600
Hey, calm down.

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.280
Think about it.
He might not even know

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:02.120
unless Duang accidentally liked
one of the older pics.

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:04.520
Not just the older one.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.360
I literally liked the first picture.

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.360
Oh, jeez.

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.360
You're so unique, man.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.840
Uniquely stupid.

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.080
Let's go before we all get caught.

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.120
You have three piles of cards
to pick from.

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:20.800
Pick the one that feels right to you,

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:24.400
and the cards will reveal
how they feel about you.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000
Pile one...

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:30.160
This pile tells you
about someone close to you.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.960
From the cards,
this person seems to have fair skin

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.800
and may have ancestry
from a country north of Thailand,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000
like China

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.080
or Korea.

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:43.200
Most importantly,
they'll do something that impresses you,

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.000
making you totally obsessed with them.

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:48.960
That's right.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.760
He sang.

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.480
He sang for me!

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.880
I feel like
you already know them a little now.

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:59.640
He likes Hainanese chicken with no skin,
extra liver, and no cucumber.

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.400
He loves Americano.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:02.440
Yes, I know him.

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:07.320
Meeting them
has made them notice your presence.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.760
They'll think
you're someone they can rely on

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:13.080
because you'll help them
with something in their life.

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.320
Help with something?

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:18.040
You'll start seeing them more often,

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:22.320
and you'll start to feel
that they're the one.

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.640
So accurate.

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.840
Qin's the one.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.240
That's absolutely correct.

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.960
- Right, and the person you met
- This is legit!

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.120
is very much an artist at heart.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:31.920
But wait,

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.320
you need to approach them slowly

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:34.760
and put in a bit more effort

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:39.440
because destiny also goes by
another name: the timing of life.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Yes!

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.080
Yes!!

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.600
"Approach them slowly."

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.240
Just you wait.

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:08.560
Guys...

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.600
Hey, guys.

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.200
I had my fortune read,

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.680
and the fortune teller said

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.640
Qin's the one for me.

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.200
How do you know she's right?

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:21.360
I checked the comments.

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:22.640
Everyone says she's always right.

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:23.960
Where did you read those comments?

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.280
MaeGaiTod on YouTube.

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:26.840
What's wrong?

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.480
Are you gonna say
she's accurate or not?

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.000
Tell me she is.

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.080
Say it!

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:33.600
Yeah. Yeah, she is.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.960
Who fed him confidence pills?

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.520
- Right.
- He's way too full of himself.

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.080
Hey, I'm not.

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.200
Wouldn't everyone commenting
be full of themselves, too, then?

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.400
They're just hyping themselves up.

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.280
Yeah, I agree.

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:46.920
Did you pick from three or five piles?

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:47.720
Three.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:48.960
Did you check
the results for all piles?

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:49.880
No.

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.040
I believe she's right.

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:52.160
Just shut it.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.600
I believe in my timing.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:58.880
Wait.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.720
How do you even know some videos
have three piles and some have five?

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:04.600
Right.

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.080
What?

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.880
- Mr. Jettana...
- What? I have no idea.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.680
Hey, did you finish the assignment?

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.800
You're sus.

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:15.920
Who's sus?

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:16.960
Both of you.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.560
You have three piles of cards
to pick from.

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.520
- Pick the one that feels right to you,
- Pae...

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:23.560
and the cards...

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:26.360
Huh?

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:27.760
- Gotcha.
- What?

00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:29.520
I got you.

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:30.680
- I need to pee.
- Pae...

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:32.640
- Where are you going?
- Pae.

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:35.160
- What were you watching?
- Hey, Pae.

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:52.560
Qin.

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:54.680
Qin!

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:55.760
Hey, Qin.

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:59.840
"They've noticed your presence."

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.880
"They think
you're someone they can rely on."

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:17.520
"They'll ask for your help."

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.920
When exactly?

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:42.200
Help me.

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.480
Someone's following me.

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.800
You're asking for my help?

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:57.600
Are you fucking dreaming?

00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.320
I'm not.

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:00.240
What did you say?

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:02.120
I'm being followed. Help me.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.320
What? You're being followed?

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.160
Yeah, are you gonna help or not?

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:07.520
Yes, I am.

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:09.920
Hey, Qin.

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.199
Qin.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.400
Why are you following Qin?

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:28.120
If there's anything
you want to say to him,

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.159
you can say it to me instead.

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.960
Okay. I'm not gonna follow him now.

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:41.159
Anyway, what's your name?

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:43.239
It's Duang.

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:49.610
You're pretty good-looking.

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:50.520
Thank you.

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:51.199
Hey!

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.480
Careful with the compliments.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000
I know I'm good-looking,

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:59.320
and if you're trying to flirt with Qin,

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.120
deal with me first.

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:03.480
Just you and me, alright?

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:08.640
Oh, hey...

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:24.000
So, babe, did you find Qin?

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.160
Yeah, but I lost him.

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:27.720
Ran into that guy instead.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:28.600
His name is Duang.

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:31.960
And how was he?

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Good-looking?

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.720
Yeah, and he's kinda funny.

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.600
That's great. Take him as well.

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:40.800
That way, we've got a full pair.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.400
The senior came looking for me again.

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:46.480
I don't wanna perform anymore.

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:50.600
So...where did that senior go?

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.040
Lost you already?

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:54.320
I had that guy
who keeps following me block him.

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.800
That fan is still following you around?

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:01.480
I said to him,
"Why are you following Qin?"

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:03.120
You know, isn't that cool?

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:05.920
So cool.

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.440
"You too can become a hero."

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.040
And then?

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:13.320
Nothing happened.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:14.840
He suddenly asked for my name.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.920
It felt sketchy,
like he was trying to sell me something.

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.320
So I told him my name
and rushed over to you guys.

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:21.920
Wait, so you
only talked to Qin that much?

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.160
That was four whole sentences.

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.880
Four sentences, dude.

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.560
That's longer than a chant.

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:32.320
Don't disrespect me like that.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.680
It reminded me of that fortune teller.

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.120
Remember what I told you?

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:36.480
She was right.

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:38.240
She said Qin would ask me for help,

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:40.840
and then he actually did.

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:43.480
And I was so close to him, like...

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:45.960
face-to-face close.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.760
Close enough to make a finger heart.

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:48.720
Cut it out.

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.040
You're exaggerating.

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:51.200
I'm not.

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:53.080
I'm sure
the rest of the results are right, too.

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:56.000
How am I supposed
to confess to Qin now?

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.440
My heart's already all his.

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.640
Just confess already.

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:03.440
If you like him so much,
then just tell him.

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:04.800
I can't do that.

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:05.680
I'm serious about this.

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:07.960
Come on, just say it.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.240
You're a born lover.

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.480
You totally got this.

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:13.720
Even though
the assignment's due today,

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:16.000
you're here thinking about him
instead of submitting anything.

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.000
That's harsh.

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.520
I'm being real, though.

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:20.640
So go on, just confess.

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:22.560
You don't understand.

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:24.480
Qin's super popular, you know.

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:26.200
People always come on to him.

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.680
"You don't understand.

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.480
Qin's super popular, you know.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:34.360
I bet people always come on to him."

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:35.680
You think only you know that?

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:37.320
If you wanna confess,
just do it already.

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.440
Don't play games.

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:43.720
What?

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:47.280
Here's what you do.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.880
Just tell him straight up
that you don't want to perform anymore.

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.640
Then he'll stop bugging you like this.

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.600
Yeah, I'll tell him.

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:02.480
Hey, guys.

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.160
Wanna go to the Loy Krathong Festival?

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:10.440
Yeah, I can go.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.160
Qin, what about you?

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:18.360
I don't want to. It's hot.

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.160
You don't need to stay too long.

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:21.400
No, I don't wanna go.

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:24.120
But there's a lot of stuff there.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:25.680
Desserts and all that.

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:27.440
You can just go with me.

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:30.520
No, but...

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.680
Didn't you say
you were craving desserts?

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:35.480
Bua loy, foi thong,

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.920
custard bread, and things like that.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:39.840
Doesn't that sound tempting?

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:50.920
Hey,

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:54.120
- What?
- you asked me how to confess, right?

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.680
Yeah, what should I do?

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.360
Friends gotta have each other's backs.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:01.080
I've got a plan
for your confession, buddy.

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:04.960
Buddy...

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:08.320
- Buddy...
- That's what friends are for.

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:31.920
- There he is.
- Where?

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:33.400
- Where is he?
- Let's go.

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:42.080
Who are you looking for?

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:44.840
The one I'm meeting.
Her name's Cherry.

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.400
Oh... (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:49.240
So that's why
you wanted to come to this festival?

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.400
No wonder you were so eager to come.

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:53.880
So, have you seen her?

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.960
I'll try texting her
to ask where she is.

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:00.960
[Where are you?]

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.360
[I can see you now]

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.520
[You can only bring one friend]

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:14.800
[I want that one next to you]

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:17.440
We'll be right back.

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:18.680
- Let's go, Qin.
- Oh...

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:22.360
No, not that one.

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:23.960
[No, not that one]

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.160
Where are you going?

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:28.320
[No, not that one]

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:38.640
Who is he calling?

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:43.880
You talk to him.

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.080
Hi, Cherry.

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.120
Where are you now?

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.520
I can see you from here.

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:59.400
But don't bring that friend with you.

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:03.840
Yes.

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.920
My friend likes that friend of yours.

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:09.000
Okay, I'll see you.

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:10.880
Okay.

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.320
Alright.

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:15.240
What now?

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.400
We'll be right back, Qin.

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:17.880
- Just stroll around for now.
- What?

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:18.920
Come on, Kim.

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.600
Where are we going? What about Qin?

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:21.600
What?

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.240
Go now. Win Qin's heart.

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:37.960
- Come on.
- What?

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:39.400
You're sending me alone?

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:42.160
Dude, nobody confesses as a group.

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:43.200
Are you nuts?

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:44.000
Exactly.

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:46.080
Just stay here
until you're ready, then.

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:47.800
Jamie and I
will buy you some time. Bye.

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:49.200
Come on, Jamie.

00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:57.960
Qin...

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:17.480
[Where are you?]

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:24.040
Let's go back to Qin.

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:25.200
Give me a moment.

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.200
No, I'm done.

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:28.440
She's ditching you for sure.

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.200
Let's go.

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.560
Keep them busy. I'll let Duang know.

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:32.680
Alright. Got it.

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:36.000
[Where are you?
I can't find you]

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:37.800
Kim,

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:39.200
I think she's coming.

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.800
- Check this out.
- What?

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.080
Qin, can I take a picture with you?

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:48.200
Can I get a picture?

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:49.880
Please excuse me.

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:51.040
Sorry. I'm in a hurry.

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:53.640
Hey!

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:06.560
Uh...

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:08.680
I was calling him.

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.430
- Oh...
- Oh...

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:12.150
Not us.

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:13.800
Not me.

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:17.120
Well...

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:18.560
I...

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:22.360
My buddy likes you.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:23.920
Your buddy?

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:33.720
My name is 'Buddy.'

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:40.400
I'm sick of it.

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:41.680
Another one like this.

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:43.760
Hey, hold on. Calm down.

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:45.760
I'm Duang. Give me a chance.

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:48.160
So is your name 'Buddy' or 'Duang'?

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:50.040
It's Duang.

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:54.520
Would you mind

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.320
if I floated my krathong with you?

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:03.160
Just say what you want.

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:06.000
Can I try to win your heart?

00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:10.040
No, I'm going to win your heart.

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:11.280
I'm not asking for your permission.

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:12.640
I just want to let you know.

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:19.520
Then tell me,
why do you want to win my heart?

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:20.280
You've got fair skin!

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:20.880
What?

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:22.520
Stop it, or you'll ruin his chance.

00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:25.240
Amazing.

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:30.200
I was trying to say
you have perfect skin.

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:33.360
You've got beautiful eyes,

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:34.930
a stunning nose,

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:37.280
pretty lips,

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000
and even...

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:41.680
perfect legs.

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:57.880
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say that.
The truth is I like you...

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:04.320
because you sing so beautifully.

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:14.120
You're incredibly charming,
you know that?

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:18.440
I feel like I've been enchanted

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:19.800
all because of your voice.

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:04.360
Good luck with that, then.

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:30.440
- Don't die just yet.
- It's just the beginning.

00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:33.480
Yay!

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:35.080
This is so embarrassing.

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:36.160
- Hey!
- Hey!

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:05.600
I've got it!

00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:07.040
My plans to make Qin mine.

00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:09.440
But there's only a thin line
between pursuing and stalking.

00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:11.320
Why are you
so madly in love with him?

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:13.400
Typically, a dog barks
at a plane, right?

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:14.320
But suddenly,

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:15.880
the plane opens the door
and lets the dog in.

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:17.040
He gave me the chance himself.

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:18.160
I've gotta do my best.

00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:20.120
If he gets uncomfortable,
then you're a stalker.

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.180
With how he's pursuing you,

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:22.080
are you uncomfortable?

00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:24.280
Do you know that
you're causing people trouble?

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:25.680
But I want to help.

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:26.760
You can, by leaving it to me.

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.720
It's too early for me to give up.

00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:31.360
Prepare to be mine!

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:37.800
♫I'll keep on flirting,
don't try to avoid me♫

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:42.600
♫'Cause I won't stop
till you fall for me♫

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:47.160
♫I'll keep on flirting,
I won't stop, I guarantee♫

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:53.600
