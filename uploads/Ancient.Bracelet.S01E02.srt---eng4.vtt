=Ancient Bracelet=

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.380
=Episode 2=

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.660
=I'm Her Husband=

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.660
Your status doesn't give you

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.320
the right to trample lives!

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.560
Sharp-tongued.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.470
Since you are of no use,

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.000
you may go to hell.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.200
Why are you here?

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.070
You saved me just now?

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.950
Thank you.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.920
(The Frost Seal shifted to her.)

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.920
What? It hurts!

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.510
(So I can feel what's happening to her.)

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.200
She's mine now.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.760
Let me go!

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.840
How dare you do this
before the Grand Princess?

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.120
We'll lose our lives for this!

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.590
(Why would the ruler save that healer?)

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.310
(Has the ruler's heart stirred for her?)

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.950
Put me down.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.920
You think I'm a toy boy.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.920
Aren't you?

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:11.750
The Fengwu Bracelet.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.800
How did it end up with you?

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.560
The Grand Princess promised
to trade it with me.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.150
The Grand Princess

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.310
doesn't keep her word at all.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.910
You know about this?

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.960
This bracelet.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.240
I truly need it.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.840
Could you lend it to me?

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.750
We can make a deal.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.680
Fine.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.750
Then let's do it again.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.400
Again?

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.120
Why bite me?

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.080
Not working.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.120
What about this?

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.520
What are you doing?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.400
We are strangers.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.870
Why do you keep toying with me?

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.120
I...

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.840
I actually shed tears.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.200
Absurd.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.680
(Without the Frost Seal,)

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.190
(my power will weaken,)

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.240
(and the Curse will strike more often.)

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.120
(Yet even recreating the scene
changed nothing.)

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:35.550
(Could it be)

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.190
(that I must kill her?)

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.420
(Everlasting Joy)

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.150
(I went through countless trials)

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.520
(to find this millennium spirit herb.)

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.090
(Yan Che, future chief)
(If I offer it to wed Zhaoli,)

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.750
(she'll be happy, right?)

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.280
(Yan Che,)

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.400
(Ming Yuan)
(I need to borrow your body)

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.960
(to deal with Ying Du)

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.710
(and reclaim all that was once mine.)

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.360
(Ying Du,)

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.480
(I'm here.)

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.040
I should never have helped that toy boy.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.190
Not only was my good deed unrewarded,

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.190
but I even offended the Grand Princess.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.680
(Wuyue tribe)
A loss-making business.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.110
She deserves it.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.070
Wu Zhaoli made a potion
without permission.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.070
She must answer to the tribe's laws.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.920
Zhaoli acted under orders.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.680
Even if there was fault,

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.430
it wasn't hers alone.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.600
Stop trying to excuse her.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.270
Since she's not present,

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.390
as the chief,

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.510
(Chief)
I'll punish you.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.430
Blame yourself for lacking discipline.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:05.510
Grandmother!

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:06.470
Zhaoli.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.640
Zhaoli.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.110
Grandmother, are you alright?

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.430
Zhaoli, why are you back?

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.270
Go now.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.600
I'm responsible for it,

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.040
but my grandmother is not.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.270
Since when do we face shared punishment?

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:22.720
Uncle.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.360
Wu Zhaoli is truly reckless.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.810
(Wu Luoluo, Yan Che's sister)
We answer to the royals.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.830
If the potion she gave
to the Grand Princess

00:05:28.841 --> 00:05:29.270
goes wrong,

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.870
no one can shoulder that burden.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.840
Wu Luoluo,

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.950
stop stirring up trouble here

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.800
by speaking of things
that haven't happened.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.110
What?

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:38.750
Are you hoping the tribe

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.190
will face some misfortune?

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:41.950
Have you not heard

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.830
of shared glory and losses?

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.160
How dare you smear her?

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:48.800
Haven't you learned any remorse?

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.310
Zhaoli.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.320
Zhaoli!

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.040
(Just a few lashes hurt this much.)

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:58.830
(If she dies,)

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.630
(will I feel the same pain?)

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.220
(I'll let her live for a few more days.)

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.040
(I can kill her after she heals.)

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.310
Do you admit your fault?

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.270
I did nothing wrong.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.390
Do you feel any regret?

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.560
It's you.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.950
Why have you come again?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.840
Because it hurts.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.520
Uncle.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:36.720
Zhaoli actually brought

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.720
a strange man back!

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.310
How reckless!

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.040
How dare an outsider trespass here!

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.960
Guards!

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.120
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.750
Seize this outsider.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:46.590
Chief,

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.390
my mistake has nothing to do with him.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.360
I don't care why you've come.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:53.830
Matters of the Wuyue tribe

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.480
are none of your concern.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.560
Leave now.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:58.360
(Struggling to protect yourself,)

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.120
(you're still trying to protect me?)

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.870
I'm no outsider.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.400
Honey.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.160
You're the one from my dreams?

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.510
I am her

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.560
husband.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:19.150
What?

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:21.310
Zhaoli is married?

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.060
What is going on?

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.650
What should Yan Che do when he's back?

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:25.900
He's been saying since childhood
that he'd marry Zhaoli.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.260
You belong to the Grand Princess.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.830
Do you even realize what you're saying

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:30.240
could get us all killed?

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.320
Whether you're Zhaoli's secret lover

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.140
or her husband,

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.440
Zhaoli must face the punishment

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:37.680
for her mistake.

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.040
This is the Puluo Token.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.830
From this day on,

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:51.190
anyone who dares harm her

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.270
will be standing against me.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.750
Zhaoli found herself a royal backer.

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:57.070
That's a powerful support.

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:58.510
Indeed.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:07.510
Put me down!

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:08.630
I can walk on my own.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:12.030
It's here.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.600
Put me down already.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.310
We've arrived.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.750
With such grievous wounds,

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:30.360
why would you still shield me?

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:34.540
I just don't want to drag
the innocent into this.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.510
We've met so many times.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:47.000
What's your name?

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.560
Ying Du.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:51.110
Ying Du?

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:56.630
Ying Du,

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:58.030
though I don't know

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:59.390
the purpose of your visit,

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.150
you just saved my life,

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.630
and I truly thank you for that.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.360
However,

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:11.150
you're the Grand Princess's toy boy.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:13.600
Sneaking out could cost you your life.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.300
If you wish to stay safe,

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:16.960
you should leave at once.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:18.110
