-Sir.
-Sir.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.125
-Sir, are you okay?
-Sir.

00:00:14.875 --> 00:00:16.541
-Sir…
-Why is he bleeding so much?

00:00:18.416 --> 00:00:19.416
Do you want to…

00:00:20.083 --> 00:00:21.916
Sir, are you okay? Sir.

00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:47.250
Hello, everyone.

00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.875
I'm Witch Baba.

00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.250
Today is October 5th.

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:54.541
Last time, I predicted that someone
would be stabbed to death.

00:00:54.625 --> 00:00:56.833
And it came true.

00:00:56.916 --> 00:00:59.791
We're still going to draw
the next prediction today.

00:00:59.875 --> 00:01:01.666
Weather Rada upright.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.041
London Big Ben reversed.

00:01:04.125 --> 00:01:06.500
Alien reversed.

00:01:07.125 --> 00:01:07.958
In the future,

00:01:08.041 --> 00:01:10.750
someone will fall from a footbridge
and die.

00:01:10.833 --> 00:01:12.208
-Take off your mask!
-Again?

00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:14.125
Are the cops asleep?

00:01:14.208 --> 00:01:16.166
-Tag the police!
-Enough already.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.750
-Jeez!
-Fall from a footbridge?

00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:18.666
Which one?

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.916
-Another death…
-Scary.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.833
-Predict one, then.
-Cyber police?

00:01:21.916 --> 00:01:24.250
-High-Tech Crime.
-Witch Baba is Yeh Pin-hsuan.

00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:25.625
Yeh Pin-hsuan.

00:01:25.708 --> 00:01:27.375
-Yeh Pin-hsuan?
-Killer.

00:01:27.458 --> 00:01:28.541
-Dox her.
-Boost this.

00:01:28.625 --> 00:01:31.666

-Which one is it?

00:03:07.458 --> 00:03:08.458
-This one…
-Come out!

00:03:08.541 --> 00:03:09.625
Aren't you a baker?

00:03:09.708 --> 00:03:11.041
Hey, they make cakes.

00:03:11.125 --> 00:03:12.583
Where's the strawberry sauce?

00:03:12.666 --> 00:03:14.750
-Give her some--
-Extra topping for her.

00:03:14.833 --> 00:03:15.958
-Eat this!
-Fuck!

00:03:16.041 --> 00:03:18.125
-Extra topping for her!
-Fuck, come out!

00:03:18.208 --> 00:03:19.458
Killer!

00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:21.500
-Someone's coming.
-What the hell?

WHAT TO DO ON SATURDAY

TREAT YOU TO A CREAM CAKE!

00:03:52.791 --> 00:03:54.541
I think he looks like a birthday boy.

00:03:55.041 --> 00:03:56.500
Hey, buddy…

00:03:56.583 --> 00:03:57.708
Happy birthday!

00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.416
Hey, come on. Blow out the candles!

00:04:03.291 --> 00:04:04.625
Your glasses are cool.

00:04:08.875 --> 00:04:09.708
Here.

00:04:19.833 --> 00:04:22.083
LIN O-YU

00:04:38.375 --> 00:04:40.125
-Hello?
-Hello, Ting-yu.

00:04:40.208 --> 00:04:41.583
How are you doing?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.333
I'm still alive.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.708
I saw Yeh Pin-hsuan
on "What To Do on Saturday."

00:04:49.791 --> 00:04:50.625
So?

00:04:50.708 --> 00:04:51.708
I'll send it to you.

00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:53.875
WAN-WAN

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.458
I ordered a cake from Sweet Spot
a few days ago.

00:04:59.041 --> 00:05:01.083
And Lin Po-lun delivered it.

00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:02.625
So?

00:05:02.708 --> 00:05:04.041
Why should I care?

00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:05.750
No, listen.

00:05:05.833 --> 00:05:08.833
Yeh Pin-hsuan appeared
in Lin Po-lun's channel.

00:05:08.916 --> 00:05:11.625
Lin Po-lun delivered a cake
for Yeh Pin-hsuan.

00:05:11.708 --> 00:05:13.791
There must be a connection here.

00:05:13.875 --> 00:05:15.416
They must've been a couple.

00:05:16.083 --> 00:05:19.541
Then they're a psycho couple
who love and kill each other.

00:05:20.041 --> 00:05:22.500
What does this have to do with me?

00:05:22.583 --> 00:05:24.458
I find it very strange, too.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.875
What's so strange about it?

00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.416
That means the killer…

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.500
It's just random killing.

00:05:41.375 --> 00:05:43.916
We suspect that she killed Lin Po-lun.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.083
But we don't have a motive.

00:05:47.666 --> 00:05:50.791
But I'm sure that Liu Yen-hua
was killed by a man.

00:05:51.541 --> 00:05:54.583
But she was at both crime scenes

00:05:55.166 --> 00:05:56.333
and in RS E-Sports.

00:05:57.291 --> 00:05:58.291
Fuck.

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:00.875
Shit. That's not good.

00:06:08.083 --> 00:06:09.791
The killer isn't killing randomly

00:06:10.416 --> 00:06:12.291
What? Hello?

Your change is 101 NTD…

00:08:12.375 --> 00:08:13.708
Where have you been?

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:15.583
I went shopping.

00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.250
What did you buy?

00:08:18.333 --> 00:08:19.458
Let's just go home.

00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:21.500
-What did you buy?
-Let's go home, okay?

00:08:21.583 --> 00:08:23.250
-Let me see.
-Don't…

00:08:29.041 --> 00:08:30.750
Hoping to kill someone?

00:08:30.833 --> 00:08:32.000
No.

00:08:32.083 --> 00:08:33.541
-Let's talk at home.
-What?

00:08:33.625 --> 00:08:34.916
No.

00:08:38.458 --> 00:08:39.791
What?

00:08:39.875 --> 00:08:41.708
I'm sorry…

Seal off all footbridges in Taipei City,
and find Yeh Pin-hsuan!

00:09:52.125 --> 00:09:54.916
But sir, there are 79 footbridges.
Where do we start--

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.625
Call all precincts for backup and support.

00:09:57.708 --> 00:09:59.208
Okay, High-Tech Crime Unit.

00:09:59.291 --> 00:10:02.041
Get every camera feed
around the footbridges.

00:10:02.125 --> 00:10:04.208
What? They found a body?

00:10:05.375 --> 00:10:07.625
-Intersection of Keelung and Xinyi.
-Let's go.

00:10:08.541 --> 00:10:10.083
Hurry…

00:10:10.166 --> 00:10:11.500
High-Tech Crime Unit, go!

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.625
Quick…

00:10:15.708 --> 00:10:17.666
-Li Hsin-ping, hurry up!
-Yes.

00:10:21.791 --> 00:10:22.625
Li Hsin-ping.

00:10:23.375 --> 00:10:24.416
You're not going.

00:10:47.291 --> 00:10:48.416
Did they have enemies?

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.041
-No, you can't do that.
-Did you call the cops?

00:10:51.125 --> 00:10:53.000
Did you call the cops to handle this?

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.833
Really? That's awful.

00:10:55.916 --> 00:10:57.625
Excuse me. Coming through.

00:10:57.708 --> 00:10:59.250
Who the heck did this?

00:10:59.333 --> 00:11:00.875
What a bunch of assholes.

00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.666
They sprayed my door like this.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:04.458
-It's not coming off.
-Excuse me.

00:11:04.541 --> 00:11:06.000
Do you know who lives here?

00:11:06.083 --> 00:11:07.083
Know them?

00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:08.875
I'm the landlady.

00:11:09.375 --> 00:11:10.458
I saw the news, and--

00:11:10.541 --> 00:11:12.000
Please open the door for me.

00:11:12.083 --> 00:11:13.833
-Police investigation.
-What?

00:11:13.916 --> 00:11:15.458
You're a police officer?

00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:17.083
Even the police are here…

00:11:17.833 --> 00:11:19.125
I don't know what to do.

-Alright.
-Kao Pi!

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.666
Less than ten minutes
after Witch Baba uploaded the video,

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:54.458
the fifth victim appeared.

00:13:54.541 --> 00:13:57.083
His identity has reportedly been revealed

00:13:57.166 --> 00:13:59.166
as the famous influencer Kao Pi.

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:01.333
There's a new theory online

00:14:01.416 --> 00:14:03.416
saying the so-called Witch Baba

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.041
is just a copycat killer.

00:14:05.125 --> 00:14:07.166
The real killer is still at large.

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:09.208
And according to insider sources,

00:14:09.291 --> 00:14:11.916
Yeh Pin-hsuan committed suicide
early this morning.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.916
She was declared dead at the hospital.

00:14:17.125 --> 00:14:18.708
Yes, sir. I know.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.958
Okay, got it. Okay.

00:14:25.875 --> 00:14:27.583
No problem. I'll take care of it.

00:14:28.125 --> 00:14:29.166
Okay, got it.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:30.333
Thank you, sir.

00:14:33.208 --> 00:14:34.291
Sir.

00:14:36.541 --> 00:14:38.416
The CID is taking over the case.

00:14:40.083 --> 00:14:44.041
It's now a serial murder case.
The division head's in charge.

00:14:44.791 --> 00:14:47.791
The High-Tech Crime Unit
will handle the precinct's role.

00:14:47.875 --> 00:14:48.750
Yes, sir.

00:14:50.666 --> 00:14:51.750
Not your concern

00:14:51.833 --> 00:14:53.000
What are you doing now?

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.333
I'm informing my colleagues
of the situation.

00:14:56.416 --> 00:14:57.833
How many more have to die?

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.333
-What?
-Did you leak Yeh Pin-hsuan's info?

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:04.083
What?

00:15:05.166 --> 00:15:07.375
You got her exposed online.

00:15:07.458 --> 00:15:09.041
You got her brand boycotted.

00:15:09.541 --> 00:15:11.666
You got her cyberbullied.

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:13.416
She died because of you.

00:15:14.166 --> 00:15:15.000
Officer.

00:15:15.083 --> 00:15:17.083
Now they're punishing everyone involved.

00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:19.291
I'll get screwed for this,
so will Mr. Jen!

00:15:19.375 --> 00:15:21.125
And you'll be off the unit.

00:15:21.208 --> 00:15:23.333
You're benched
until the ruling comes down.

00:15:23.416 --> 00:15:24.458
Sir.

00:15:25.458 --> 00:15:28.458
-She isn't involved in this.
-Of course! This is all on you!

00:15:31.541 --> 00:15:32.666
-Fuck!
-What?

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:34.083
Shit!

00:15:34.166 --> 00:15:35.750
Your video is on the internet.

00:15:35.833 --> 00:15:37.041
-Get his face…
-I can't…

00:15:40.583 --> 00:15:42.875
Fuck! Hurry, get past him. Quick!

00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.041
Go faster! You suck.

00:15:45.541 --> 00:15:48.166
-Get him.
-Get his face! Aim for his tires.

00:15:49.375 --> 00:15:50.416
What the heck?

00:15:50.916 --> 00:15:52.208
Don't let it hit me…

00:15:53.041 --> 00:15:55.166
-YOU THINK THAT'S FUN?
-THE TRUTH IS OUT!

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:57.708
WEI YEN, WA TSAI,
KAO PI, TING-YU ARE LINKED

00:15:57.791 --> 00:15:59.000
THE KILLER WANTS REVENGE

00:15:59.083 --> 00:16:01.916
-WITCH BABA TARGETED THEM
-SO TING-YU'S NEXT?

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.916
-TING-YU, WANNA EXPLAIN?
-SAY SOMETHING

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.208
Hurry up! It hit me!

00:16:05.291 --> 00:16:06.958
She's targeted you since day one.

00:16:07.041 --> 00:16:08.625
Why didn't you tell the police?

00:16:09.208 --> 00:16:12.708
-Get his head!
-Shit! He's lighting the big one.

00:16:12.791 --> 00:16:15.166
No. These two things aren't related.

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:17.500
How long have you been hiding this for?

00:16:18.125 --> 00:16:20.208
I wasn't hiding anything, I just…

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:33.291
You're now a major person of interest.

00:16:33.375 --> 00:16:35.208
Please cooperate with the police.

00:16:37.916 --> 00:16:39.291
Get him back to the hospital.

00:16:59.583 --> 00:17:00.416
Hey.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.083
Are you okay?

00:17:12.375 --> 00:17:13.458
Are you okay?

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:17.625
Define "okay"?

00:17:18.125 --> 00:17:19.416
How can you even smile?

00:17:25.458 --> 00:17:29.166
None of this would've happened
if you hadn't made such a huge mess.

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:30.083
I had no idea.

00:17:30.166 --> 00:17:32.583
How could I have known
it would end up like this?

00:17:32.666 --> 00:17:34.416
Tell me, were there any casualties?

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:35.708
No.

00:17:35.791 --> 00:17:36.708
No?

00:17:38.833 --> 00:17:39.791
I don't think so.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.708
It looked fine to me back then.

00:17:44.791 --> 00:17:45.875
"Looked"?

00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:48.791
It was serious.

00:17:48.875 --> 00:17:50.708
Why didn't you call an ambulance?

00:17:50.791 --> 00:17:52.250
Why didn't you tell Mr. Jen?

00:17:52.333 --> 00:17:54.958
-I didn't think they were related.
-They are related.

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:58.625
If you'd told the police,
we would've solved it by now.

00:17:59.416 --> 00:18:01.833
Kao Pi died because of you.
So did Wa Tsai.

00:18:01.916 --> 00:18:03.000
Yeh Pin-hsuan…

00:18:11.166 --> 00:18:12.000
Hey.

00:18:12.541 --> 00:18:13.916
Hey, come on.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.208
Why are you doing this?

00:18:15.291 --> 00:18:17.500
Yeh Pin-hsuan didn't die because of you.

00:18:19.625 --> 00:18:21.166
They all died because of me.

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:23.458
"They"?

00:18:23.541 --> 00:18:24.458
Who are they?

00:18:26.208 --> 00:18:27.333
None of your business.

00:18:28.208 --> 00:18:29.458
Wait.

00:18:29.541 --> 00:18:30.375
Look.

00:18:32.208 --> 00:18:34.083
I'm being threatened online.

00:18:34.166 --> 00:18:35.791
Of course it's my business.

00:18:35.875 --> 00:18:37.666
I could die any minute.

00:18:44.625 --> 00:18:47.250
My friend has been missing for five days.

00:18:47.333 --> 00:18:49.666
I need you to find her now, please.

00:18:51.208 --> 00:18:54.208
We don't have a search warrant.
Do you want to get sued?

00:18:56.833 --> 00:18:59.000
Then why not request a search warrant?

00:18:59.083 --> 00:19:01.000
If it's that easy, you do it

00:19:03.541 --> 00:19:05.416
Sir, I'm requesting a search warrant.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:06.500
Not again.

00:19:07.083 --> 00:19:09.500
I suspect his girlfriend is in his place.

00:19:09.583 --> 00:19:11.083
Didn't you go to his place?

00:19:11.166 --> 00:19:12.958
Did you see his girlfriend?

00:19:13.625 --> 00:19:14.958
I didn't see her.

00:19:15.041 --> 00:19:17.333
I couldn't go in without a search warrant.

00:19:17.416 --> 00:19:18.666
When we got there,

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:20.875
his dog kept barking at one of the doors--

00:19:20.958 --> 00:19:22.875
This is because of a dog?

00:19:23.708 --> 00:19:25.125
CASE REPORTING PROCEDURE

00:19:25.208 --> 00:19:26.041
Not by the book.

00:19:36.333 --> 00:19:38.458
CHEN WEI-JOU

00:19:46.166 --> 00:19:48.083
WHAT? WHAT HAPPENED?

00:19:50.166 --> 00:19:52.458
SINGLE

00:19:58.333 --> 00:20:01.666
Mr. Kao, this is a Taipei District Court
search warrant. Open up.

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:08.583
Stop!

00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:10.500
Come here.

00:20:26.375 --> 00:20:27.458
Fuck! Let go of me!

00:20:32.125 --> 00:20:33.791
I later found out

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:37.500
she tried to leave her boyfriend,
so he locked her up.

00:20:40.208 --> 00:20:42.791
She had already been held hostage
for two weeks.

00:20:44.541 --> 00:20:46.458
In the end, she chose to die.

00:20:50.083 --> 00:20:51.291
I've always wondered,

00:20:51.375 --> 00:20:54.416
if I had gone in just a little sooner…

00:20:56.291 --> 00:20:57.791
would she…

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.291
have lived?

00:21:00.375 --> 00:21:01.458
POLICE EXAM

00:21:02.083 --> 00:21:05.166
That's when I decided
to get into the High-Tech Crime Unit.

00:21:06.541 --> 00:21:09.250
I wanted a faster, more efficient way

00:21:09.333 --> 00:21:11.750
to help desperate people.

00:21:16.541 --> 00:21:18.458
Even now, I still worry…

00:21:20.625 --> 00:21:21.708
That I'm useless.

00:21:23.375 --> 00:21:25.416
Whether it was then or now,

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.083
no matter which unit I'm in…

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.750
I can't change anything.

00:21:45.458 --> 00:21:46.708
Why are you following me?

00:21:46.791 --> 00:21:48.666
Your boss said to get me to the hospital.

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:51.625
-I'm a major person of interest.
-Then take a cab.

00:21:53.375 --> 00:21:54.416
Hey.

00:21:55.166 --> 00:21:56.791
I'm already injured!

00:21:57.333 --> 00:21:59.208
What do you want? You're so annoying.

00:21:59.791 --> 00:22:01.833
I just think you became a cop

00:22:02.791 --> 00:22:04.833
because someone needs your help.

00:22:06.916 --> 00:22:08.291
I can't help anyone.

00:22:08.375 --> 00:22:09.875
You can help me.

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:13.666
Witch Baba is behind all this.

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:16.333
If I don't find out who she is,

00:22:16.416 --> 00:22:18.583
I'll never forgive myself.

00:22:19.208 --> 00:22:20.958
I won't be able to die in peace.

00:22:21.041 --> 00:22:22.250
Why should I care?

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:23.583
Hey.

00:22:24.125 --> 00:22:27.625
You want to be a cop
just like I want to be an influencer.

00:22:27.708 --> 00:22:28.750
There's a reason.

00:22:34.125 --> 00:22:35.250
Give me a hand.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.750
I wanted to be an influencer
to get my dad's attention.

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:53.583
When I was little,
my dad owed gambling debts

00:22:54.208 --> 00:22:55.416
and then he left.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:56.958
I barely ever saw him.

00:22:57.666 --> 00:22:59.166
He said he'd come back.

00:23:00.083 --> 00:23:01.416
It was all bullshit.

00:23:03.041 --> 00:23:04.583
I worked hard making videos,

00:23:04.666 --> 00:23:06.041
acting like an idiot,

00:23:06.125 --> 00:23:07.250
trying to get famous.

00:23:08.416 --> 00:23:10.583
I just hoped that one day,
if I did make it,

00:23:10.666 --> 00:23:12.333
he could see me online.

00:23:13.583 --> 00:23:15.583
But right when I hit 500k subscribers,

00:23:15.666 --> 00:23:17.375
my grandma told me he passed away.

00:23:18.583 --> 00:23:20.333
I lost all motivation.

00:23:22.416 --> 00:23:23.583
But at that time,

00:23:24.333 --> 00:23:25.833
one of my fans told me

00:23:26.416 --> 00:23:29.541
that when her mom died,
my videos helped her through it.

00:23:30.125 --> 00:23:31.541
It was my videos

00:23:32.125 --> 00:23:34.416
that helped her through the toughest time.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.791
I don't know how that became this.

00:23:41.083 --> 00:23:44.166
But I think there must be something
that only we can do.

00:23:46.416 --> 00:23:48.166
We haven't caught the killer yet.

00:23:48.958 --> 00:23:50.250
Pull yourself together.

00:23:57.875 --> 00:23:58.916
It's not that easy.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.291
Yeh Pin-hsuan was a Witch Baba copycat.

00:24:08.333 --> 00:24:09.833
Maybe Yeh Pin-hsuan…

00:24:10.333 --> 00:24:12.083
Maybe Witch Baba contacted her.

00:24:12.875 --> 00:24:14.833
Witch Baba contacted Wa Tsai.

00:24:18.666 --> 00:24:19.708
Wait.

00:24:20.583 --> 00:24:23.250
Chen Chia-jen knows all this.
Didn't he tell you?

00:24:26.333 --> 00:24:27.958
They don't tell me anything.

00:24:29.083 --> 00:24:30.000
Hey.

00:24:30.083 --> 00:24:31.000
Hey.

00:24:33.291 --> 00:24:34.833
Where are you going now?

00:24:34.916 --> 00:24:37.583
-Back to the High-Tech Crime Unit.
-You're going back?

00:24:38.458 --> 00:24:41.666
I joined the unit
so I couldn't hide behind procedure.

00:25:05.083 --> 00:25:11.250
OPEN

00:26:09.333 --> 00:26:10.166
Hey, sir.

00:26:12.375 --> 00:26:14.291
-Can I help you?
-I want to ask…

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:16.333
What is it?

00:26:16.416 --> 00:26:18.000
Do you sell these here?

00:26:19.833 --> 00:26:22.916
Lots of people are buying them.
They're all sold out now.

00:26:23.458 --> 00:26:24.375
-Really?
-All gone.

00:26:25.333 --> 00:26:26.583
Also…

00:26:26.666 --> 00:26:28.291
Well… This one…

00:26:28.958 --> 00:26:31.250
Wait, this girl…

00:26:32.083 --> 00:26:33.416
Do you know her?

00:26:35.083 --> 00:26:36.500
Do I know her?

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.500
She comes here often.

00:26:38.583 --> 00:26:39.458
To buy what?

00:26:40.083 --> 00:26:42.125
She bought the cards you're looking for.

00:26:42.708 --> 00:26:44.750
And this mask.

00:27:03.291 --> 00:27:04.166
Yu-chieh.

00:27:34.458 --> 00:27:35.458
Yu-chieh.

00:27:42.541 --> 00:27:43.458
Yu-chieh.

00:27:45.041 --> 00:27:46.750
Guess what place I got today?

00:27:54.125 --> 00:27:55.041
You're home.

00:27:55.708 --> 00:27:56.791
Dinner's ready.

00:30:56.791 --> 00:30:59.583
The unit must've seized
Yeh Pin-hsuan's phone.

00:30:59.666 --> 00:31:00.708
We're on our own.

00:31:01.541 --> 00:31:02.375
How?

00:31:02.916 --> 00:31:04.375
Hop on and I'll explain.

00:31:11.291 --> 00:31:12.333
-Hey.
-Ready? Yes?

00:31:12.416 --> 00:31:13.916
Can your High-Tech Crime Unit

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.333
restore deleted videos from the phone?

00:31:18.625 --> 00:31:19.708
Piece of cake.

00:31:25.458 --> 00:31:28.083
EVIDENCE ROOM

00:31:35.958 --> 00:31:37.000
Hey, good job.

00:31:37.083 --> 00:31:38.375
OFFICER SHEN WEI-HAO

00:31:38.958 --> 00:31:40.000
What are those?

00:31:40.083 --> 00:31:40.916
Evidence.

00:31:41.416 --> 00:31:43.125
-Evidence? What evidence?
-Yeah.

00:31:43.208 --> 00:31:45.708
I seized them
from an illegal balloon vendor.

00:31:47.083 --> 00:31:48.250
Why?

00:31:49.583 --> 00:31:51.166
I couldn't stand by and watch.

00:31:53.708 --> 00:31:54.916
Gosh, I dropped it.

00:31:56.666 --> 00:31:57.958
Jeez, come on.

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:01.750
-It's heavy. Can you carry it?
-Can't you see I'm on duty?

00:32:01.833 --> 00:32:03.958
-Just take it to the second floor.
-Hey.

00:32:04.041 --> 00:32:05.583
-Thanks.
-Come back.

00:32:05.666 --> 00:32:06.708
Thanks.

00:32:08.916 --> 00:32:10.083
Shit.

00:32:12.291 --> 00:32:13.291
So annoying.

00:32:13.375 --> 00:32:16.708
MAINTAIN PUBLIC ORDER,
PROTECT SOCIETY, PREVENT ALL HARM

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:33.791
Why aren't you in the hospital?

00:32:34.916 --> 00:32:37.875
I'm here to return Officer Li's keys.

00:32:37.958 --> 00:32:39.250
I borrowed her scooter.

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:41.583
Give them to me.

00:32:41.666 --> 00:32:44.375
-I'll just put them here.
-I said, give them to me.

00:32:56.875 --> 00:32:58.291
These are Li Hsin-ping's keys?

00:32:59.375 --> 00:33:00.541
I was surprised, too.

00:33:01.833 --> 00:33:03.750
Hey, didn't I tell you to call me?

00:33:03.833 --> 00:33:05.083
I don't have your number.

00:33:05.166 --> 00:33:06.416
You can call and ask me.

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:08.083
-Literally, how?
-A-Li.

00:33:09.541 --> 00:33:10.666
Are these your keys?

00:33:14.083 --> 00:33:16.000
Yes, they're mine.

00:33:19.708 --> 00:33:20.833
Aren't you leaving?

00:33:21.916 --> 00:33:22.833
Great job, everyone.

00:33:22.916 --> 00:33:24.708
-I forgot my balloons?
-Keep it up.

00:33:25.458 --> 00:33:27.083
A-Li, thanks for your hard work.

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:30.791
Mr. Li.

00:33:39.083 --> 00:33:42.708
EVIDENCE ROOM

00:35:42.583 --> 00:35:43.666
What are you doing?

00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:44.833
Sir.

00:35:47.666 --> 00:35:50.916
-Are you stealing evidence?
-No, I'm submitting evidence.

00:35:52.541 --> 00:35:54.625
Why did you hide behind the cabinet?

00:35:55.458 --> 00:35:58.291
Because this just fell back there.
I was picking it up.

00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:00.583
What is that?

00:36:02.416 --> 00:36:03.583
I don't know.

00:36:04.125 --> 00:36:04.958
Hand it over.

00:36:12.125 --> 00:36:13.625
What were you doing in here?

00:36:14.958 --> 00:36:16.708
I came to submit evidence.

00:36:18.666 --> 00:36:20.208
You're hiding something.

00:36:20.291 --> 00:36:21.208
Leave now!

00:36:21.916 --> 00:36:22.750
Yes, sir.

00:36:24.791 --> 00:36:25.708
Li Hsin-ping.

00:36:30.875 --> 00:36:32.875
Don't forget which unit you're in.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:34.958
High-Tech Crime.

00:36:37.791 --> 00:36:38.625
I'm sorry.

00:36:49.958 --> 00:36:51.916
Hey, Ting-yu.

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:54.500
Catch.

00:37:08.708 --> 00:37:10.458
-Shit.
-Hey.

00:37:11.833 --> 00:37:13.500
-Give me the phone.
-Hey.

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:16.375
-What?
-Do you know the password?

00:37:16.458 --> 00:37:18.500
Password? Easy. Take this.

00:37:21.791 --> 00:37:22.625
What's that?

00:37:22.708 --> 00:37:24.416
A decoder.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:27.958
Wow.

00:38:33.208 --> 00:38:35.708
She deleted her Instagram and Facebook.

00:38:38.833 --> 00:38:40.458
She was probably bombarded.

00:38:41.291 --> 00:38:42.916
Let's check her call history.

00:38:58.875 --> 00:39:00.458

CALLING

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.208
Amy Hostel, hello.

00:39:31.291 --> 00:39:33.041
For Chinese service, please dial 1.

00:39:33.666 --> 00:39:34.500
Hostel?

00:39:35.375 --> 00:39:36.708
Why did a hostel call?

00:39:39.958 --> 00:39:42.083
BULGARIAN INTO CHINESE (TRADITIONAL)

00:39:45.791 --> 00:39:47.208
Amy Hostel.

00:40:20.416 --> 00:40:22.541
Hi, I'm Li Hsin-ping,
High-Tech Crime Unit.

00:40:22.625 --> 00:40:24.708
I'm requesting this week's guest records.

00:40:25.291 --> 00:40:27.041
Sure. Let me get the manager.

00:40:27.125 --> 00:40:28.416
Okay, please hurry.

00:40:30.208 --> 00:40:33.208
Hi, sir. A police officer
is requesting the guest records.

00:40:37.291 --> 00:40:38.125
Alright.

00:40:50.541 --> 00:40:51.708
Witch Baba?

00:40:55.666 --> 00:40:56.916
Hey, fuck! It's her!

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.458
Hey…

00:41:01.083 --> 00:41:02.166
Hey.

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:06.875
-Stop!
-Why the hell are you running?

00:41:07.666 --> 00:41:08.666
Hey!

00:41:09.333 --> 00:41:10.166
Hey.

00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:11.958
Where are you running to?

00:41:17.666 --> 00:41:19.083
Go the other way.

00:41:19.166 --> 00:41:20.000
What?

00:41:21.375 --> 00:41:22.875
Which way is that?

00:41:38.041 --> 00:41:39.375
Stop right there!

00:41:43.125 --> 00:41:44.458
Hey, stop!

00:41:45.041 --> 00:41:45.916
Don't go!

00:41:49.166 --> 00:41:50.416
Stop running!

00:41:51.875 --> 00:41:52.916
Who are you?

00:41:53.541 --> 00:41:54.625
Who the hell are you?

00:41:58.250 --> 00:41:59.583
Where is my daughter?

00:42:00.583 --> 00:42:02.041
Where is my daughter?

00:42:02.125 --> 00:42:03.500
I don't know…

00:42:03.583 --> 00:42:05.458
-Tell me where she is!
-I don't know.

00:42:05.541 --> 00:42:07.666
I don't know, I'm sorry…

00:42:09.666 --> 00:42:10.666
Where is she?

00:42:12.541 --> 00:42:14.375
I'm asking where Yu-chieh is!

00:42:19.791 --> 00:42:21.416
Please save Yu-chieh.

00:42:23.166 --> 00:42:24.666
Can you save Yu-chieh?

00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:26.000
I'm begging you.

00:42:26.083 --> 00:42:28.041
Please save Yu-chieh.

00:42:28.708 --> 00:42:29.791
Please.

00:42:47.833 --> 00:42:49.791
This is all we had last time, right?

00:42:51.333 --> 00:42:52.541
There was a candle, too.

00:42:53.125 --> 00:42:55.083
Yes, you're right.

00:42:58.041 --> 00:42:58.875
Thank you.

00:43:01.833 --> 00:43:03.458
I think that's it.

00:43:09.458 --> 00:43:10.750
Don't be nervous.

00:43:10.833 --> 00:43:12.291
I'm not nervous.

00:43:12.375 --> 00:43:14.208
You look stiff. Loosen up a little.

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:15.916
-Fine.
-You got this.

00:43:19.916 --> 00:43:22.500
Don't be nervous.
If you mess up, I can edit it out.

00:43:22.583 --> 00:43:23.791
No, I'm not.

00:43:25.708 --> 00:43:27.208
Ready… Action.

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:31.166
Hello, everyone. I'm Witch Baba.
Today is February 15th.

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:33.833
The fire I predicted actually happened.

00:43:33.916 --> 00:43:36.958
-Be extra careful with heaters at home.
-Hey, cut.

00:43:37.583 --> 00:43:39.458
-What?
-You forgot your mask.

00:43:39.541 --> 00:43:41.041
Right, I totally forgot.

00:43:41.125 --> 00:43:43.458
Hold the front, I'll pull it to the back.

00:43:43.541 --> 00:43:44.375
Thank you.

00:43:45.166 --> 00:43:46.875
-What?
-Wait, it hurts…

00:43:46.958 --> 00:43:47.958
You pulled my hair.

00:43:48.041 --> 00:43:49.625
I didn't. Put it on yourself.

00:43:49.708 --> 00:43:51.666
-You did. You wear it.
-No. You wear it.

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:53.541
-Come here…
-Why should I wear it?

00:43:53.625 --> 00:43:55.125
-Quick…
-I'm not the one talking…

00:43:55.208 --> 00:43:56.458
No!

00:43:56.541 --> 00:43:58.916
-Hurry.
-You wear it. I'm not wearing it.

00:44:02.666 --> 00:44:04.875
So someone kidnapped your friend

00:44:04.958 --> 00:44:06.708
and forced you to make predictions.

00:44:10.041 --> 00:44:11.541
And you went along with it?

00:44:11.625 --> 00:44:13.208
Why didn't you call the police?

00:44:13.708 --> 00:44:15.416
I didn't know people would die.

00:44:15.916 --> 00:44:17.791
And I don't even know who he is.

00:44:17.875 --> 00:44:19.083
-If Yu-chieh--
-Shit.

00:44:19.166 --> 00:44:22.833
You've been in contact with him
for so long, but you don't know who he is?

00:44:22.916 --> 00:44:24.875
Do you know who he is, then?

00:44:25.416 --> 00:44:27.500
I'm not the one who caused his accident.

00:44:30.666 --> 00:44:31.750
That's not the point.

00:44:32.375 --> 00:44:33.958
Why did he go to you, then?

00:44:35.208 --> 00:44:37.208
Because you upload videos at a net cafe?

00:44:38.583 --> 00:44:40.875
Why did you do it there
in the first place?

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:44.833
-Who did you mess with?
-I honestly don't know.

00:44:45.916 --> 00:44:47.583
Stop playing the victim.

00:44:47.666 --> 00:44:49.416
Why did you call Yeh Pin-hsuan?

00:44:52.583 --> 00:44:54.875
I thought she was the killer.

00:44:54.958 --> 00:44:57.750
I just wanted to tell her to stop killing.

00:45:05.833 --> 00:45:07.416
What about the car crash video?

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:10.291
How did you obtain that video?

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.125
If it was because of that car crash,

00:45:17.625 --> 00:45:19.250
I think I know why.

00:45:23.333 --> 00:45:25.500
Witch Baba's predictions are all fake.

00:45:25.583 --> 00:45:27.041
But a year ago,

00:45:27.125 --> 00:45:29.708
Witch Baba predicted a car accident.

00:45:31.708 --> 00:45:33.541
Intercontinental Missile upright.

00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:35.916
Statue of Liberty reversed.

00:45:36.666 --> 00:45:39.000
The Great Fire of London upright.

00:45:39.958 --> 00:45:41.458
Next,

00:45:41.541 --> 00:45:43.708
there will be a car crash.

00:45:44.541 --> 00:45:47.041
That's the car crash in your video.

00:45:52.791 --> 00:45:54.500
FATAL CAR CRASH
MOTHER &amp; DAUGHTER DEAD
