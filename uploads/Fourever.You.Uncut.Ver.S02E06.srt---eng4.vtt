WEBVTT

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.980
Aren’t you mad at him for not talking to you directly?

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.360
I’m actually glad it was Phoon.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.620
Why is P'Fah so kind?

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.680
He even remembered that I’m afraid of the dark.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.500
Here you go, cocoa for someone special.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.680
Someone special?

00:00:28.976 --> 00:00:30.272
Seriously, what are you guys doing?

00:00:30.592 --> 00:00:31.226
Disguising.

00:00:31.824 --> 00:00:34.938
I just wanted to know how I’d feel if I got to meet you.

00:00:35.184 --> 00:00:37.936
And I found out that it feels really good.

00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:45.744
Wait.

00:00:46.544 --> 00:00:49.957
I really like how soft your lips are when I kiss you.

00:01:16.944 --> 00:01:18.240
Yes, P'Fah.

00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:21.440
Are you free to talk, Phoon?

00:01:23.856 --> 00:01:24.922
Yes, I am.

00:01:25.525 --> 00:01:26.890
Is there something you need, P'Fah?

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.880
I wanted to ask if you’re going home this break.

00:01:34.837 --> 00:01:36.592
I probably won’t.

00:01:38.202 --> 00:01:40.357
So you’ll be alone, Phoon?

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.912
I think so.

00:01:43.285 --> 00:01:44.933
I was alone last break too.

00:01:45.664 --> 00:01:52.266
Then how about spending the break with me?
My parents said they want to see you. It’s been a while.

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:54.640
At your place, P'Fah?

00:01:55.216 --> 00:01:58.160
Yes. Or do you want to go somewhere else?

00:02:04.117 --> 00:02:06.005
Can I let you know again later?

00:02:07.936 --> 00:02:08.768
Sure.

00:02:10.933 --> 00:02:11.792
Phoon.

00:02:12.288 --> 00:02:12.965
Yes?

00:02:13.813 --> 00:02:15.573
Was today a good day for you?

00:02:25.776 --> 00:02:26.736
It was.

00:02:27.568 --> 00:02:28.741
A very good day.

00:02:31.472 --> 00:02:32.666
What about you, P'Fah?

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.605
Very good as well.

00:04:43.173 --> 00:04:44.460
Hurry up, damn it.

00:04:44.741 --> 00:04:48.661
Of all days to be late, you had to be late on exam day.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.026
You complain so much.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.192
Why are you so late?

00:05:12.805 --> 00:05:13.600
I overslept.

00:05:38.592 --> 00:05:39.781
Who’s gonna pass?

00:05:45.205 --> 00:05:47.776
It’s like everything I studied got returned to the professor already.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.509
I couldn’t do any of it.

00:05:50.245 --> 00:05:52.373
Do you think anyone will pass?

00:05:52.624 --> 00:05:56.197
Even with P'Hill tutoring me, I still couldn’t do it.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.280
Are you complaining about the exam or showing off your boyfriend?

00:06:03.461 --> 00:06:05.594
So how are you getting home? Want me to take you?

00:06:06.213 --> 00:06:08.997
You go on ahead. I think I’ll stop by P'Gib’s cafe.

00:06:10.032 --> 00:06:12.965
Wow, great. Just leave me behind.

00:06:13.493 --> 00:06:16.533
I’ll be all alone and lonely like this.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.460
You? Lonely?

00:06:19.376 --> 00:06:21.568
I see you changing girls you talk to all the time.

00:06:23.045 --> 00:06:25.381
That reminds me, I should go see my sweetheart too.

00:06:26.896 --> 00:06:28.053
- See you!
- There he is.

00:06:28.112 --> 00:06:29.781
Friends never even get to see your face.

00:06:29.925 --> 00:06:31.050
See you.

00:06:35.552 --> 00:06:36.517
So, how was it?

00:06:36.997 --> 00:06:37.989
You went to see him?

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:40.522
How was it? Tell us, Maew.

00:06:42.896 --> 00:06:44.938
Well, uh—

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.704
- I’ll tell you all at once later.
- Oh?

00:06:48.938 --> 00:06:49.930
You sure?

00:06:50.853 --> 00:06:52.314
Come on, this needs details.

00:06:55.861 --> 00:06:59.434
So? Come on, Maew. Tell us.

00:07:00.101 --> 00:07:02.544
Damn it, North. You’re quick about stuff like this.

00:07:02.693 --> 00:07:04.570
If you told me like that. It means you tell to Daotok too.

00:07:04.698 --> 00:07:06.517
I know it. You went and pushed him, didn’t you?

00:07:06.912 --> 00:07:09.584
- North was the one who dragged me out.
- See?.

00:07:09.866 --> 00:07:11.013
I knew it.

00:07:11.829 --> 00:07:13.002
You never help me.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.424
You’re such a nosy.

00:07:15.642 --> 00:07:16.650
Whatever.

00:07:16.773 --> 00:07:17.941
Let’s talk about this instead.

00:07:18.186 --> 00:07:20.512
So, how was it? Your first time meeting—

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:23.160
Stop. Don’t say it.

00:07:25.802 --> 00:07:29.952
P'Fah isn’t bad at all, you know.

00:07:30.394 --> 00:07:31.749
Aha.

00:07:35.461 --> 00:07:37.610
Ugh, stop making that face already.

00:07:38.181 --> 00:07:39.397
What face?

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:40.218
The face like that.

00:07:42.624 --> 00:07:45.296
- Your face is way less bad than mine?
- Of course.

00:07:45.754 --> 00:07:46.762
Here. A mirror.

00:07:51.658 --> 00:07:53.189
Damn it, Dao. When are you ever free?

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:58.848
- Hey, when are you going to have time to work? You never submit club work.
- What are you nagging about, Ter?

00:08:00.394 --> 00:08:01.189
P'Fah.

00:08:02.042 --> 00:08:03.296
Hi, P'Fah.

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:04.778
What a coincidence.

00:08:05.248 --> 00:08:05.845
Yeah.

00:08:06.224 --> 00:08:07.370
Such a coincidence.

00:08:11.498 --> 00:08:13.264
We haven’t seen each other in a long time, P'Fah.

00:08:13.674 --> 00:08:15.893
Didn’t we just see each other yesterday?

00:08:22.149 --> 00:08:23.936
You’re here to get drinks at P'Gib’s cafe again?

00:08:30.037 --> 00:08:33.642
Oh, uh… the peach tea at P'Gib’s cafe is really good.

00:08:35.274 --> 00:08:39.029
Are you heading home already? Want me to take you?

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:42.837
That’d be great.

00:08:43.717 --> 00:08:46.512
North’s going to see P'Jo anyway, and I was planning to see P'Hill.

00:08:46.821 --> 00:08:48.602
Daotok, don’t you have work this evening?

00:08:48.666 --> 00:08:50.460
- Yeah.
- Busy again.

00:08:50.672 --> 00:08:51.424
Everyone’s busy.

00:08:51.562 --> 00:08:54.602
Man, Phoon has to go home alone. I’m worried about him.

00:08:54.794 --> 00:08:58.352
True, but if P'Fah takes him home, that’s a relief.

00:08:59.285 --> 00:09:00.762
- Right?
- Yeah.

00:09:00.821 --> 00:09:01.493
Exactly.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.192
Then please, go ahead.

00:09:04.277 --> 00:09:06.357
Yeah, if you go home with P'Fah, that’s reassuring.

00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:23.189
Bye, P'Fah.

00:09:23.264 --> 00:09:25.557
Bye. Please take care of him for us, P'Fah.

00:09:25.952 --> 00:09:26.816
Of course.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.880
So, have you decided whether you’ll come with me during the break?

00:09:52.229 --> 00:09:52.880
Uh…

00:09:53.184 --> 00:09:54.837
Is your place far, P'Fah?

00:09:55.648 --> 00:09:56.906
Not far from the university.

00:09:57.248 --> 00:09:58.805
Just a short drive.

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:07.840
But if you don’t want to go, that’s okay.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.952
Don’t overthink it.

00:10:10.645 --> 00:10:12.842
My parents would understand.

00:10:13.104 --> 00:10:14.309
Uh…

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:15.904
That’s not it, really.

00:10:21.674 --> 00:10:23.050
I’ll go.

00:10:23.717 --> 00:10:25.834
I was just thinking about uncle and aunt anyway.

00:10:27.178 --> 00:10:30.416
That’s great. My parents will be really happy.

00:10:37.072 --> 00:10:39.109
Oh, by the way, how were the exams?

00:10:40.309 --> 00:10:42.250
They were good.

00:10:42.789 --> 00:10:44.053
Mm.

00:10:44.837 --> 00:10:46.725
And how about transferring?

00:10:46.938 --> 00:10:48.672
About I tutoring you like I said.

00:10:48.933 --> 00:10:50.192
I really meant it.

00:10:50.394 --> 00:10:52.720
That wouldn’t be a burden for you, right?

00:10:53.424 --> 00:10:55.914
Of course not. Are you free tonight?

00:10:56.304 --> 00:10:57.776
I’ll tutor you.

00:10:58.298 --> 00:10:59.290
Huh?

00:11:02.048 --> 00:11:03.834
Would that really be okay?

00:11:04.165 --> 00:11:05.152
Of course.

00:11:05.296 --> 00:11:06.460
I’ll call you later.

00:11:07.589 --> 00:11:10.565
Oh, a call?

00:11:12.746 --> 00:11:13.605
Why?

00:11:14.336 --> 00:11:16.460
Or do you want me to tutor you in your room?

00:11:16.789 --> 00:11:19.098
Ah— a call would be better.

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:21.136
Okay.

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:25.738
I’ve got a light exam tomorrow.

00:11:26.234 --> 00:11:28.746
So I should be free tonight.

00:11:30.837 --> 00:11:31.637
Alright.

00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:09.802
Thanks for taking me home.

00:12:12.768 --> 00:12:16.026
I’ll call you tonight.

00:12:17.413 --> 00:12:18.368
Okay.

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:32.656
Hello.

00:13:33.781 --> 00:13:34.810
Hello.

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:36.965
Ready?

00:13:37.765 --> 00:13:38.602
I’m ready.

00:13:40.144 --> 00:13:42.266
Then let’s get started.

00:13:43.413 --> 00:13:45.237
You still have your high school textbooks, right?

00:13:47.114 --> 00:13:48.026
I do.

00:13:48.277 --> 00:13:49.013
Okay.

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:03.301
Phoon.

00:14:04.314 --> 00:14:04.741
Yes?

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:06.789
Today…

00:14:07.296 --> 00:14:08.656
I went to see him.

00:14:12.618 --> 00:14:13.370
Uh…

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:15.077
Who?

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.168
The person from the letters.

00:14:19.514 --> 00:14:20.640
Oh.

00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:24.757
Are you okay?

00:14:28.869 --> 00:14:30.149
I’m fine.

00:14:30.976 --> 00:14:31.909
And…

00:14:33.178 --> 00:14:34.170
How was it?

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.760
I was really happy he agreed to meet me.

00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:41.984
But…

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:43.818
He cried.

00:14:45.434 --> 00:14:47.157
I really didn’t want him to cry.

00:14:48.752 --> 00:14:52.858
If I asked him not to cry anymore… would that be okay?

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.605
I was really scared.

00:15:08.512 --> 00:15:09.552
What were you scared of?

00:15:10.816 --> 00:15:12.693
That he’d overthink things.

00:15:13.296 --> 00:15:14.826
Because of everything that happened.

00:15:15.392 --> 00:15:16.928
It was all intentional.

00:15:17.514 --> 00:15:19.541
I don’t want him to think I wasn’t serious.

00:15:28.581 --> 00:15:29.045
Oh.

00:15:29.632 --> 00:15:32.000
Sorry, I got off topic.

00:15:32.368 --> 00:15:33.440
Shall we continue studying?

00:15:34.272 --> 00:15:36.165
Uh, sure.

00:15:36.922 --> 00:15:38.133
Mm.

00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:53.584
Done.

00:15:54.538 --> 00:15:55.797
You did great.

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:59.000
Shall we stop here for today?

00:15:59.232 --> 00:16:00.565
I’ll tutor you again later.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.460
Okay. Sure.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.181
Alright. Go get some rest.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.520
Good night.

00:16:12.149 --> 00:16:13.258
Good night.

00:16:42.954 --> 00:16:46.384
Holy shit, dude. P'Fah posted a photo of you.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.460
Damn, look at his face.

00:18:08.672 --> 00:18:09.418
Huh?

00:18:10.128 --> 00:18:11.434
Didn’t expect that.

00:18:12.106 --> 00:18:13.610
- Why is he like that?
- Yeah.

00:18:14.058 --> 00:18:17.157
Seriously, I thought you’d be grinning ear to ear after seeing P'Fah’s IG story.

00:18:17.301 --> 00:18:19.072
What’s with that sour face? Like a cat’s butt.

00:18:20.272 --> 00:18:21.738
Cheer up, now!

00:18:22.224 --> 00:18:23.584
Is something wrong?

00:18:24.992 --> 00:18:26.277
Do you think…

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.584
If P'Fah finds out I’m the person from the letters,

00:18:30.298 --> 00:18:31.600
Would he be disappointed?

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:33.648
Ugh.

00:18:37.258 --> 00:18:39.040
Doesn’t P'Fah seem to like you though?

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:39.834
Mm.

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:43.434
P'Fah is kind to everyone.

00:18:43.856 --> 00:18:47.008
Maybe he really likes the person in the letter.

00:18:47.456 --> 00:18:50.229
But with me, he probably just sees me as a little brother.

00:18:50.576 --> 00:18:53.434
Come on, what kind of little brother gets posted on IG Story like that?

00:18:54.794 --> 00:18:58.460
"Study hard, alright, my good boy."

00:18:58.565 --> 00:19:00.768
Wow, what kind of “little brother” is that?

00:19:01.114 --> 00:19:02.709
Definitely not just bros.

00:19:03.749 --> 00:19:05.381
I think so too—it’s not like bros.

00:19:05.797 --> 00:19:06.650
I mean…

00:19:06.965 --> 00:19:09.482
What if I’m just his option or something?

00:19:11.018 --> 00:19:15.621
It’s hard to say, you know.
Maybe because we know Maew is the person in the letter.

00:19:15.925 --> 00:19:19.114
So it doesn’t really feel that strange to us.

00:19:28.122 --> 00:19:29.824
Why are you kids looking so stressed?

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:33.349
- Eat some snacks first.
- Oh, that’s too kind of you, P'Gib.

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.650
Wow, and that’s you being considerate?

00:19:37.232 --> 00:19:38.698
You jerk.

00:19:38.794 --> 00:19:40.245
Hey, what?

00:19:40.656 --> 00:19:43.850
What if it’s poisoned?

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:48.677
Oh come on, this is to celebrate finishing exams.

00:19:49.344 --> 00:19:51.952
Once it’s break, we won’t see each other for days.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.288
Yeah.

00:19:54.826 --> 00:19:56.709
So during the break,

00:19:56.938 --> 00:19:58.460
how are you going to talk to Fah?

00:20:01.088 --> 00:20:02.373
I honestly don’t know.

00:20:03.125 --> 00:20:03.877
Huh.

00:20:05.429 --> 00:20:06.880
Hmm.

00:20:07.349 --> 00:20:10.688
Have you tried reading Fah’s letter yet?

00:20:18.069 --> 00:20:19.461
Ugh, you’re so damn nosy.

00:20:20.869 --> 00:20:21.722
Just like you.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:22.858
You're worse than me.

00:20:23.882 --> 00:20:26.144
If it’s not too much trouble,

00:20:26.768 --> 00:20:28.970
may I see you again?

00:20:29.173 --> 00:20:31.290
There’s something important I want to talk to you about.

00:20:32.138 --> 00:20:33.898
After the last exam day.

00:20:34.229 --> 00:20:36.416
I’ll be waiting at the park.

00:20:40.816 --> 00:20:42.112
What should I do, guys?

00:20:43.098 --> 00:20:44.304
Do about what?

00:20:44.378 --> 00:20:48.026
- He said he’ll wait at the park, just go see him.
- Yeah.

00:20:51.925 --> 00:20:52.954
What’s wrong, Phoon?

00:20:53.482 --> 00:20:55.477
This is your chance—go for it.

00:20:55.754 --> 00:20:58.874
If it’s break, how are you two supposed to keep talking through letters anyway?

00:21:00.144 --> 00:21:01.098
Just go.

00:22:06.981 --> 00:22:07.930
Thank you very much.

00:22:09.077 --> 00:22:10.176
Thank you for coming.

00:22:21.146 --> 00:22:22.272
You forgot this the other day.

00:22:46.677 --> 00:22:48.778
You said you had something important to talk to me about.

00:22:49.056 --> 00:22:49.696
Yes.

00:22:50.261 --> 00:22:51.706
I haven’t felt at ease at all.

00:22:51.957 --> 00:22:52.997
So I wanted to apologize

00:22:53.226 --> 00:22:54.512
for overstepping my bounds.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.413
It’s really okay.

00:23:18.314 --> 00:23:19.200
Thank you.

00:23:41.861 --> 00:23:43.061
Shall we take a walk?

00:24:12.752 --> 00:24:13.984
It’s really beautiful here.

00:24:18.997 --> 00:24:20.460
It’s even nicer in the evening.

00:24:24.762 --> 00:24:26.021
Next time,

00:24:26.746 --> 00:24:27.866
would you like to come here with me again?

00:24:37.104 --> 00:24:37.941
You…

00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:39.856
don’t want to come with me?

00:24:52.981 --> 00:24:53.712
Will you come?

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:18.085
About what I said I wanted to talk to you about—
you might be wondering why I kissed you.

00:25:20.565 --> 00:25:21.962
The answer is,

00:25:22.298 --> 00:25:23.600
simply because I wanted to kiss you.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:26.954
Not just yesterday.

00:25:28.021 --> 00:25:29.152
Right now as well.

00:25:32.293 --> 00:25:33.834
I want to cherish you,

00:25:35.061 --> 00:25:36.522
not only in letters.

00:25:41.013 --> 00:25:42.826
I want to hear you call my name,

00:25:43.424 --> 00:25:44.784
and tell me you love me.

00:25:48.112 --> 00:25:50.460
Not just cheering me on from afar.

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.344
I want to hold you,

00:25:58.362 --> 00:25:59.813
and take the best care of you

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.460
as much as a man possibly can.

00:26:07.813 --> 00:26:08.880
I love you.

00:26:23.818 --> 00:26:25.546
For the rest of my life from now on.

00:26:47.872 --> 00:26:50.080
Please be my boyfriend.

00:27:26.874 --> 00:27:30.224
If you find out who I really am, you won’t be disappointed, right?

00:27:30.736 --> 00:27:31.765
There’s no way.

00:27:32.021 --> 00:27:33.285
Just being you is enough.

00:27:33.616 --> 00:27:34.864
No one could be better than this.

00:27:40.368 --> 00:27:41.493
I’m sorry.

00:27:42.042 --> 00:27:43.978
I’m sorry for trying to pull you out of your safe zone.

00:27:45.242 --> 00:27:48.762
But from now on, may I be your safe zone too?

00:27:54.768 --> 00:27:56.266
This might be too fast.

00:27:58.389 --> 00:27:59.898
So how about this?

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.634
I’ll count from one to ten.

00:28:03.594 --> 00:28:05.386
The question I asked just now—

00:28:06.266 --> 00:28:07.776
if you’re not ready,

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:09.861
you can just walk away.

00:28:10.613 --> 00:28:12.261
And we’ll go back to where we were before,

00:28:13.205 --> 00:28:14.650
the place where you feel comfortable.

00:28:15.125 --> 00:28:16.661
No matter how long it takes, I’ll wait.

00:28:19.056 --> 00:28:20.725
But if you say yes,

00:28:22.101 --> 00:28:23.872
could you please turn back around?

00:28:29.552 --> 00:28:30.460
Ten.

00:28:32.314 --> 00:28:33.248
Nine.

00:28:34.394 --> 00:28:35.530
Eight.

00:28:36.981 --> 00:28:37.722
Seven.

00:28:38.869 --> 00:28:39.696
Six.

00:28:43.029 --> 00:28:44.042
Five.

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:50.341
Four.

00:28:56.885 --> 00:28:57.754
Three.

00:29:03.157 --> 00:29:04.128
Two.

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:15.237
One.

00:29:35.722 --> 00:29:36.624
Yes.

00:30:06.954 --> 00:30:08.256
Nice to finally meet you.

00:30:09.072 --> 00:30:10.410
The person from the letters.

00:30:11.152 --> 00:30:12.074
Likewise.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.960
As the person from the letters.

00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:19.968
It’s my first time hearing your voice.

00:30:20.629 --> 00:30:22.357
Would you like to introduce yourself?

00:30:29.877 --> 00:30:30.901
Typhoon.

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:33.333
And you?

00:30:34.261 --> 00:30:35.578
Tonfah.

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.253
Nice to love you.

00:30:43.824 --> 00:30:46.405
Nice to love you too.

00:31:03.114 --> 00:31:03.760
Phoon.

00:31:05.456 --> 00:31:08.037
P'Fah is cheating. I didn’t even have time to prepare.

00:31:09.248 --> 00:31:11.024
Can I post it on Instagram and tag you?

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:13.706
Would that be okay?

00:31:14.064 --> 00:31:16.901
Hey, we’re dating now. Can’t we post a couple photo?

00:31:19.429 --> 00:31:20.725
Alright.

00:31:23.493 --> 00:31:24.400
Oh.

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:28.128
You have my Instagram too, P'Fah?

00:31:29.296 --> 00:31:31.893
Yeah. I check it pretty often.

00:31:33.077 --> 00:31:33.856
Phoon.

00:31:34.213 --> 00:31:36.677
Wait a sec. You’ll get lost.

00:31:38.506 --> 00:31:39.653
I won’t get lost.

00:31:40.341 --> 00:31:41.056
Really?

00:31:41.866 --> 00:31:43.632
Then I’m not necessary anymore?

00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:48.362
Uh—no. That’s not what I meant.

00:31:51.658 --> 00:31:52.460
And this—

00:31:53.002 --> 00:31:53.850
how did you get here?

00:31:55.146 --> 00:31:56.357
Well—

00:31:57.024 --> 00:31:57.957
I called a ride.

00:32:00.309 --> 00:32:01.296
Then—

00:32:02.266 --> 00:32:03.610
want to go back with me?

00:32:05.082 --> 00:32:07.946
You mean you will take me back to my dorm?

00:32:11.408 --> 00:32:12.602
Right?

00:32:13.946 --> 00:32:15.690
Can’t you stay over at my place?

00:32:15.909 --> 00:32:17.413
We’re dating now.

00:32:19.296 --> 00:32:22.256
So what if we are?

00:32:24.074 --> 00:32:26.460
Then we should spend time together.

00:32:26.938 --> 00:32:28.090
What are you thinking, Phoon?

00:32:28.986 --> 00:32:29.626
Hmm?

00:32:30.666 --> 00:32:31.152
Hmm?

00:32:33.328 --> 00:32:35.168
I’m not thinking about anything.

00:32:36.325 --> 00:32:37.594
- Let’s go.
- Hey.

00:32:38.106 --> 00:32:39.386
You’re really not coming?

00:32:39.664 --> 00:32:42.048
- No.
- My bed’s really comfy.

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:44.165
Phoon, wait for me.

00:33:11.829 --> 00:33:14.218
I thought I’d never come back here again.

00:33:14.944 --> 00:33:16.352
You had to come back.

00:33:16.693 --> 00:33:18.149
No matter where you go,

00:33:18.394 --> 00:33:19.962
you have to come back to P'Fah.

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:25.546
By the way—

00:33:26.794 --> 00:33:28.460
why did you turn back?

00:33:30.042 --> 00:33:31.349
I thought—

00:33:32.282 --> 00:33:33.712
you were going to walk away.

00:33:35.365 --> 00:33:36.346
No.

00:33:37.514 --> 00:33:38.954
I’ve always been right here.

00:33:40.698 --> 00:33:42.010
I made a promise to myself

00:33:42.602 --> 00:33:44.277
from the day I left this place.

00:33:45.605 --> 00:33:47.002
that I wouldn’t go anywhere.

00:33:47.632 --> 00:33:49.344
If you turned around,

00:33:50.261 --> 00:33:51.648
I’d always be right here.

00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.944
Come on, good boy.

00:33:59.333 --> 00:34:01.754
Why did you say back then that I annoyed you?

00:34:05.882 --> 00:34:07.722
Where are you going?

00:34:10.410 --> 00:34:12.112
P'Fah, let go.

00:34:12.602 --> 00:34:13.541
I won’t.

00:34:14.032 --> 00:34:17.536
So I can know whether you lied to me or not.

00:34:20.597 --> 00:34:21.909
I didn’t lie.

00:34:23.093 --> 00:34:24.160
Really?

00:34:25.792 --> 00:34:28.069
Bad kid need to be punished.

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:29.034
Uh—

00:34:29.605 --> 00:34:31.301
I can’t tell you yet.

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:32.460
About—

00:34:32.757 --> 00:34:34.357
why I had to do that.

00:34:39.162 --> 00:34:40.730
So you have a reason but can’t say it?

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:43.605
I’m sorry.

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:47.109
Then it’s okay.

00:34:48.624 --> 00:34:49.552
I think—

00:34:51.402 --> 00:34:52.976
we should change your apology

00:34:53.904 --> 00:34:55.557
into something else.

00:34:59.797 --> 00:35:01.104
P'Fah is going to—

00:35:02.208 --> 00:35:02.922
let—

00:35:03.194 --> 00:35:06.192
change the apology into what?

00:35:48.624 --> 00:35:50.005
What are you doing, P'Fah?

00:35:50.768 --> 00:35:51.978
Let’s save it for later.

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:54.245
I know you’re not ready yet.

00:36:00.074 --> 00:36:01.418
Don’t go yet.

00:36:02.026 --> 00:36:04.181
If you’re a good boy, you should stay like this for now.

00:36:07.557 --> 00:36:08.314
Okay.

00:36:12.106 --> 00:36:12.960
You smell nice.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.288
That tickles.

00:36:21.162 --> 00:36:21.898
Phoon.

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.685
Don’t you have anything you want to ask me?

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:36.144
Aren’t you surprised, P'Fah, that the person from the letters was Phoon?

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:43.477
Honestly—

00:36:44.106 --> 00:36:46.176
I already knew it was you, Phoon.

00:36:46.544 --> 00:36:47.098
Huh?

00:36:47.968 --> 00:36:49.754
How did you know? When?

00:36:50.069 --> 00:36:51.173
On my birthday.

00:36:52.037 --> 00:36:53.738
When you wrote that birthday message.

00:36:54.288 --> 00:36:56.618
The handwriting on the card and in the letters—

00:36:57.562 --> 00:36:58.460
it’s the same.

00:37:01.402 --> 00:37:02.384
Oh.

00:37:03.584 --> 00:37:05.488
So I messed up, huh?

00:37:07.797 --> 00:37:11.034
Then when you let me read the letters, that means—

00:37:11.173 --> 00:37:13.669
You wrote them yourself and read them yourself.

00:37:14.352 --> 00:37:15.962
I even thought—

00:37:16.325 --> 00:37:17.504
how cute it was.

00:37:18.165 --> 00:37:20.336
P'Fah, why did you have to tease me like that?

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:22.208
Well, why are you so good at being cute?

00:37:23.488 --> 00:37:24.544
I don’t know.

00:37:25.274 --> 00:37:26.074
I.

00:37:27.072 --> 00:37:28.336
I should go take a shower.

00:37:29.888 --> 00:37:31.525
Do you always run away when you’re shy?

00:37:47.392 --> 00:37:48.394
What are you doing?

00:37:50.922 --> 00:37:52.656
I’m looking at these photos.

00:37:54.138 --> 00:37:56.256
So many people sent you things.

00:37:56.698 --> 00:38:00.394
But why did you choose to reply to this letter?

00:38:02.224 --> 00:38:03.760
Because this letter—

00:38:04.288 --> 00:38:06.069
it was thoughtful,

00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:09.349
sincere, and caring.

00:38:11.728 --> 00:38:13.674
And it didn’t expect anything in return.

00:38:14.698 --> 00:38:17.216
It felt like you just wanted me to know you liked me.

00:38:19.002 --> 00:38:19.909
Also—

00:38:21.024 --> 00:38:22.928
there was someone in it who’s my type.

00:38:26.208 --> 00:38:28.261
Someone who’s your type?

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:32.805
You really are my type, Phoon.

00:38:38.848 --> 00:38:40.357
I really like you too, P'Fah.

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:43.514
I always have.

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.621
Where are you running off to?

00:39:02.757 --> 00:39:04.842
I’m sleepy.

00:39:06.016 --> 00:39:07.354
Stay and talk to me first.

00:39:16.234 --> 00:39:18.314
I can’t believe this is real.

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:21.957
Tomorrow—

00:39:22.517 --> 00:39:24.272
you won’t disappear, right?

00:39:26.213 --> 00:39:27.328
No way.

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:29.669
You too.

00:39:32.021 --> 00:39:33.722
You won’t disappear again, right?

00:39:35.541 --> 00:39:36.698
I won’t go anywhere.

00:39:37.568 --> 00:39:40.741
Then tonight we’ll have to hold each other tight.

00:39:41.173 --> 00:39:43.733
So no kid sneaks away from me in my sleep again.

00:39:45.194 --> 00:39:46.992
I told you—I’m not going anywhere.

00:39:49.477 --> 00:39:50.293
Okay.

00:39:50.581 --> 00:39:51.733
I believe you.

00:39:52.565 --> 00:39:54.746
So, shall we sleep?

00:40:06.528 --> 00:40:07.445
Phoon.

00:40:10.186 --> 00:40:11.738
Can we turn off the lights?

00:40:16.874 --> 00:40:17.781
Sure.

00:40:19.696 --> 00:40:20.890
You’re not scared anymore?

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.757
With you here, I’m not scared.

00:40:26.592 --> 00:40:27.338
Good job.

00:40:50.954 --> 00:40:51.882
Good night.

00:40:55.568 --> 00:40:56.460
Good night.

00:41:42.864 --> 00:41:46.773
Good morning, P'Fah.
I saw there was food in the kitchen, so I thought I’d—

00:42:08.917 --> 00:42:12.330
I told you I wouldn’t disappear on you.

00:42:13.205 --> 00:42:15.104
I’m sorry.

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:18.074
I woke up and couldn’t find you, so I panicked.

00:42:19.797 --> 00:42:22.026
I just wanted to make breakfast for you.

00:42:24.522 --> 00:42:25.594
This is—

00:42:25.792 --> 00:42:28.405
the sandwich and milk you used to send all the time.

00:42:30.218 --> 00:42:31.820
But it seems—

00:42:32.405 --> 00:42:34.698
P'Arthit gets to eat them more often.

00:42:34.917 --> 00:42:36.378
That’s true.

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:39.642
My hands are full.

00:42:40.101 --> 00:42:41.514
Can you feed me?

00:42:56.992 --> 00:42:59.381
Mmm, it’s really good.

00:43:04.912 --> 00:43:05.546
Oh—

00:43:06.768 --> 00:43:10.341
I already told my parents I’d bring you to visit.

00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:14.821
Won’t Uncle and Aunt be suspicious?

00:43:15.088 --> 00:43:15.600
About—

00:43:15.936 --> 00:43:17.621
why I suddenly came to see them?

00:43:18.256 --> 00:43:19.136
No.

00:43:19.386 --> 00:43:21.850
Ever since I told them you study here,

00:43:22.341 --> 00:43:24.528
they’ve wanted you to visit many times.

00:43:26.768 --> 00:43:27.877
Actually,

00:43:28.416 --> 00:43:30.032
I should’ve made time to visit more often.

00:43:30.602 --> 00:43:33.173
Back then, Uncle and Aunt were kind to me—and Fun too…

00:43:41.392 --> 00:43:44.229
I’ll go get more milk.

00:43:46.352 --> 00:43:49.925
- Do you want anything else, P'Fah?
- No, I’m good.

00:44:51.450 --> 00:44:52.826
You’re here already, dear?

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:57.296
Phoon, it’s been so long since I last saw you.

00:44:58.352 --> 00:44:59.712
- Hello, Auntie.
- Hello.

00:45:00.053 --> 00:45:01.514
How have you been? Are you doing well?

00:45:01.909 --> 00:45:04.768
- I’m doing well. And you?
- I’m well too.

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.280
I heard you’re studying at the same place as Fah, right?

00:45:07.514 --> 00:45:08.352
Yes.

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:12.976
Why don’t you come visit us more? We miss you so much.

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.384
I haven’t talked to Rit in ages either.

00:45:17.008 --> 00:45:21.738
Uh—sorry.

00:45:22.122 --> 00:45:23.365
I’m just teasing you.

00:45:23.685 --> 00:45:25.664
I know you’ve been busy with your studies.

00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:29.642
And you’re living far from home now, right?

00:45:30.373 --> 00:45:32.122
Let’s go inside first, dear. Come on.

00:45:49.509 --> 00:45:51.498
Uh, and how is uncle?

00:45:51.738 --> 00:45:55.829
He’s in the hospital, dear. But he said he’d hurry back so we can have dinner together.

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.978
He’s still working just as hard as ever, isn’t he?

00:45:58.309 --> 00:46:00.304
It can’t really be helped.

00:46:05.493 --> 00:46:09.674
Ma’am, a client is calling. They’re waiting on the line now.

00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:13.872
See? I didn’t even finish speaking.

00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:16.229
Alright then, I’ll step out to take the call for a moment.

00:46:16.736 --> 00:46:18.224
Fah, help watch him for me, okay?

00:46:18.688 --> 00:46:19.530
Yes, Mom.

00:46:24.069 --> 00:46:26.282
Your mom hasn’t changed at all, has she?

00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:28.037
That’s true.

00:47:01.850 --> 00:47:03.173
This is P'Fah’s room.

00:47:04.794 --> 00:47:06.288
It’s even bigger than the old house.

00:47:08.869 --> 00:47:09.893
Mm.

00:47:11.013 --> 00:47:13.306
But without the neighborhood kids coming over to play…

00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:14.762
it feels a bit lonely.

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:27.493
You still haven’t made up for letting go of P'Fah’s hand, you know.

00:47:29.098 --> 00:47:30.682
This is your house.

00:47:31.072 --> 00:47:33.632
- We can’t hold hands.
- Why not?

00:47:35.125 --> 00:47:35.466
Well—

00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:38.576
What if someone sees us?

00:47:39.989 --> 00:47:41.514
Phoon, you don’t want others to know?

00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:42.154
Hmm?

00:47:44.101 --> 00:47:46.704
I’m worried uncle and aunt might see us and not be okay with it.

00:47:56.736 --> 00:47:57.616
I’m sorry.

00:48:03.584 --> 00:48:05.285
Phoon won’t let go of my hand.

00:48:05.648 --> 00:48:07.909
I’ll tell Mom and Dad that we’re dating.

00:48:10.602 --> 00:48:13.530
- But—
- We really are dating.

00:48:16.154 --> 00:48:16.810
Okay?

00:48:19.722 --> 00:48:20.378
Okay.

00:48:31.706 --> 00:48:32.917
That’s a relief.

00:48:39.077 --> 00:48:41.344
Typhoon, it’s been so long. How have you been?

00:48:42.405 --> 00:48:43.328
I’m doing well.

00:48:44.154 --> 00:48:45.845
And what about Rit? Is he doing well?

00:48:51.562 --> 00:48:52.746
Dad is…

00:48:54.042 --> 00:48:54.981
doing well.

00:48:56.549 --> 00:48:59.178
Last time he said he’d come visit, but he never did.

00:49:08.101 --> 00:49:09.669
- Phoon, dear.
- Yes?

00:49:11.504 --> 00:49:15.130
Eat a lot, okay? We haven’t seen each other in ages.

00:49:15.397 --> 00:49:18.080
How are you still this small? I really can’t accept that.

00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:18.986
Yes.

00:49:19.797 --> 00:49:20.778
Fah.

00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:21.770
Yes?

00:49:21.861 --> 00:49:24.848
I heard that Hill and Johan already have lovers. Is that true?

00:49:26.037 --> 00:49:26.992
Yes, Mom.

00:49:27.445 --> 00:49:28.330
And what about you, Fah?

00:49:28.677 --> 00:49:31.114
Aren’t you going to find me a daughter-in-law?

00:49:35.226 --> 00:49:36.949
Our son has been too busy studying.

00:49:37.104 --> 00:49:38.320
Oh, Dad.

00:49:38.533 --> 00:49:40.460
Shouldn’t he at least have someone to talk to?

00:49:41.450 --> 00:49:43.664
Or should you finish your studies first?

00:49:44.170 --> 00:49:44.858
What do you think, son?

00:50:08.133 --> 00:50:09.760
Dad. Mom.

00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:14.261
Phoon and I are dating.

00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:31.360
Really?

00:50:49.706 --> 00:50:53.808
Oh my, when I said I wanted a daughter-in-law,

00:50:54.261 --> 00:50:57.717
I didn’t expect it to happen this fast.

00:50:59.317 --> 00:51:00.460
Dad, are you okay with it?

00:51:03.509 --> 00:51:04.304
Of course.

00:51:05.610 --> 00:51:07.306
I’m not that old-fashioned.

00:51:09.104 --> 00:51:11.397
It’s even better that it’s someone we already know.

00:51:12.154 --> 00:51:13.776
That way, we don’t have to worry.

00:51:13.824 --> 00:51:15.365
about Fah meeting the wrong person.

00:51:19.408 --> 00:51:20.661
Thank you.

00:51:21.877 --> 00:51:23.557
How long have you two been together?

00:51:26.613 --> 00:51:29.504
Not very long.

00:51:30.757 --> 00:51:33.888
This is such good news. We should celebrate.

00:51:33.957 --> 00:51:35.098
We definitely should celebrate.

00:51:35.264 --> 00:51:35.893
Yes.

00:51:36.005 --> 00:51:36.602
Phoon.

00:51:37.285 --> 00:51:39.733
- Do you want anything else to eat?
- I’m fine, thank you.

00:51:40.266 --> 00:51:41.306
Here, eat up.

00:51:42.229 --> 00:51:43.333
Should we order from this restaurant again?

00:51:43.536 --> 00:51:44.460
Sure, Dad.

00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:47.989
Eat plenty, okay?

00:52:04.090 --> 00:52:05.098
What are you watching?

00:52:06.394 --> 00:52:07.578
Easter and North.

00:52:07.936 --> 00:52:09.205
They sent photos showing off their trip abroad.

00:52:09.834 --> 00:52:10.906
Mm.

00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:16.650
Phoon, do you want to go too?

00:52:18.048 --> 00:52:18.460
Hmm?

00:52:23.792 --> 00:52:26.112
If I want to go, can I just go like that?

00:52:29.546 --> 00:52:32.336
If you want to go, P'Fah will take you.

00:52:35.322 --> 00:52:36.965
Don’t spoil me too much.

00:52:37.552 --> 00:52:38.997
Or I’ll become a spoiled kid.

00:52:39.541 --> 00:52:40.709
Mm.

00:52:41.856 --> 00:52:43.856
I always spoils my boyfriend anyway.

00:52:45.637 --> 00:52:46.778
Mm.

00:52:48.672 --> 00:52:50.090
Let me think about it first.

00:52:50.554 --> 00:52:53.450
But right now, I don’t really want to go anywhere.

00:52:54.208 --> 00:52:55.680
What about P'Fah’s room?

00:52:56.325 --> 00:52:57.072
Do you want to go?

00:53:00.192 --> 00:53:01.168
Just kidding.

00:53:02.789 --> 00:53:03.546
By the way—

00:53:05.232 --> 00:53:06.608
Do you feel better now?

00:53:07.434 --> 00:53:09.424
My parents didn’t seem upset at all.

00:53:09.898 --> 00:53:11.258
They even looked happy.

00:53:12.325 --> 00:53:13.578
They’re still just as kind as ever.

00:53:21.205 --> 00:53:22.757
Was today a good day for Phoon?

00:53:26.197 --> 00:53:26.677
Yes.

00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:29.866
So, was today a good day for P'Fah?

00:53:31.610 --> 00:53:32.874
With Phoon here and all.

00:53:33.562 --> 00:53:35.200
Then of course it has to be a good day.

00:54:43.664 --> 00:54:45.141
P'Fah.

00:54:55.728 --> 00:54:57.600
I'm starting to lose my patience now.

00:55:01.728 --> 00:55:03.829
But I will wait until Phoon is ready.

00:55:11.077 --> 00:55:12.080
Is that okay?

00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:35.056
Phoon.

00:55:37.269 --> 00:55:37.856
Yes.

00:55:38.917 --> 00:55:40.405
You’re not alone anymore, you know.

00:55:43.338 --> 00:55:45.669
Those heavy things you’ve been carrying—

00:55:47.386 --> 00:55:48.730
you can share them with me.

00:55:57.568 --> 00:55:58.613
Do you understand?

00:55:59.317 --> 00:55:59.872
Hmm?

00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:01.333
Do you understand?

00:56:01.701 --> 00:56:02.266
Yes.

00:56:05.728 --> 00:56:07.098
About what you asked me to look into, Khun Tonfah,

00:56:07.285 --> 00:56:08.928
I have some updates to report.

00:56:09.898 --> 00:56:10.597
Go on.

00:56:11.413 --> 00:56:13.930
Thorfun passed away three to four years ago.

00:56:27.962 --> 00:56:29.573
Oh, you’re up early, Phoon.

00:56:30.922 --> 00:56:31.882
Come, sit here.

00:56:36.768 --> 00:56:37.733
Is Fah still asleep?

00:56:38.730 --> 00:56:41.914
Oh, he’s awake already. He’s taking a shower.

00:56:46.778 --> 00:56:47.216
Yes.

00:56:48.512 --> 00:56:50.032
- Go ahead, dear.
- Thank you.

00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:54.896
And what about Fun? Is she doing well?

00:56:57.573 --> 00:57:00.325
That’s right, it’s been a long time since we last saw her.

00:57:08.090 --> 00:57:10.901
- Good morning.
- Good morning, dear.

00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:17.029
- How are you?
- We’re doing fine.

00:57:17.973 --> 00:57:20.896
We’ll probably head to Phuket.

00:57:44.149 --> 00:57:46.789
Goodbye.

00:57:50.864 --> 00:57:51.962
Come visit often, okay?

00:57:52.272 --> 00:57:53.130
I will.

00:57:53.989 --> 00:57:54.928
Drive safely.

00:57:55.045 --> 00:57:55.749
Yes, Dad.

00:57:57.354 --> 00:57:58.309
We’re heading off now.

00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:01.520
- Goodbye, Mom and Dad.
- Take good care of each other.

00:58:20.288 --> 00:58:21.098
That’s sweet.

00:58:29.253 --> 00:58:30.368
Is there anywhere you want to stop by, Phoon?

00:58:38.389 --> 00:58:39.717
The temple in the village.

00:59:08.944 --> 00:59:09.408
Um…

00:59:11.445 --> 00:59:15.253
Aren’t you going to ask why we came back to Phuket?

00:59:15.930 --> 00:59:17.322
Is it strange that I didn’t ask?

00:59:19.136 --> 00:59:19.850
It is.

00:59:20.885 --> 00:59:23.765
At least you should ask.

00:59:29.216 --> 00:59:31.114
P'Fah must be angry with me for sure.

00:59:32.810 --> 00:59:33.882
Why would I be?

00:59:37.605 --> 00:59:39.386
It’s okay if you’re angry at me.

00:59:40.170 --> 00:59:41.338
I’ll apologize.

00:59:41.749 --> 00:59:42.640
But…

00:59:44.784 --> 00:59:47.482
Can we not break up?

00:59:48.794 --> 00:59:49.498
Phoon.

00:59:50.277 --> 00:59:53.056
We just started dating. Why are you talking about breaking up?

00:59:54.165 --> 00:59:55.232
That’s not good at all.

00:59:55.504 --> 00:59:56.880
Should I punish you for that?

00:59:58.282 --> 00:59:59.514
I’m serious.

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:01.509
We’re not breaking up.

01:00:03.002 --> 01:00:05.205
Yes. No way.

01:00:09.066 --> 01:00:10.597
It took so long just to meet you.

01:00:10.954 --> 01:00:12.240
P'Fah won’t let go that easily.

01:00:18.389 --> 01:00:18.944
Let’s go.

01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:01.765
P'Fah.

01:01:02.213 --> 01:01:03.648
I’m sorry.

01:01:05.173 --> 01:01:06.933
About everything—

01:01:08.213 --> 01:01:09.370
I lied to you.

01:01:18.197 --> 01:01:18.949
Phoon.

01:01:20.256 --> 01:01:21.189
It’s okay.

01:01:21.733 --> 01:01:23.157
I already knew.

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.032
I’ve known for a long time.

01:01:29.013 --> 01:01:32.352
I was just waiting for you to be ready to tell me yourself.

01:01:36.896 --> 01:01:38.234
You’re not angry with me?

01:01:39.626 --> 01:01:40.842
I understand you.

01:02:00.997 --> 01:02:01.690
Fun.

01:02:02.357 --> 01:02:04.965
I’m sorry I never came to see you.

01:02:07.146 --> 01:02:08.880
You don’t have to worry about Phoon anymore.

01:02:10.213 --> 01:02:11.269
From now on,

01:02:11.717 --> 01:02:13.088
I’ll take care of him myself.

01:02:23.088 --> 01:02:24.133
Don’t cry.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:57.840
Fun.

01:03:06.512 --> 01:03:09.477
I probably don’t have anything to worry about anymore.

01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:12.400
It’s really time for me to go now.

01:03:18.304 --> 01:03:19.840
Can’t you stay?

01:03:27.994 --> 01:03:30.240
Thank you for everything.

01:03:33.466 --> 01:03:34.000
Mm.

01:03:35.024 --> 01:03:36.460
I love you, Fun.

01:03:40.106 --> 01:03:41.424
I love you too, Phoon.

01:04:06.357 --> 01:04:07.429
Are you okay?

01:04:20.794 --> 01:04:22.138
I can feel Fun.

01:04:28.277 --> 01:04:29.605
Even though it hurts,

01:04:29.861 --> 01:04:30.602
and I miss her,

01:04:33.024 --> 01:04:34.704
every time I feel her,

01:04:36.544 --> 01:04:38.336
it’s such a good feeling.

01:04:41.269 --> 01:04:42.368
But this time,

01:04:49.322 --> 01:04:50.357
she came to say goodbye.

01:04:53.818 --> 01:04:55.466
Because she has nothing to worry about anymore, right?

01:04:59.962 --> 01:05:01.189
I understand.

01:05:02.912 --> 01:05:04.570
I want Fun to rest peacefully.

01:05:05.877 --> 01:05:07.018
She doesn’t have to worry about me anymore.

01:05:09.253 --> 01:05:10.677
But when I think about it again…

01:05:11.376 --> 01:05:12.460
I thought we might never see each other again.

01:05:16.208 --> 01:05:17.013
It’s just…

01:05:18.389 --> 01:05:20.080
a bit heartbreaking.

01:05:27.141 --> 01:05:28.576
Phoon, listen to me.

01:05:29.930 --> 01:05:31.274
Fun hasn’t gone anywhere.

01:05:32.544 --> 01:05:33.376
Because Fun

01:05:34.837 --> 01:05:36.896
will always live on in the memories of both of us.

01:05:41.530 --> 01:05:42.298
That’s true.

01:06:14.624 --> 01:06:17.642
I never thought I’d get to watch the sunset with you like this.

01:06:19.733 --> 01:06:20.565
Why not?

01:06:25.568 --> 01:06:26.976
It just felt impossible.

01:06:27.498 --> 01:06:29.077
Huh? Why’s that?

01:06:31.770 --> 01:06:32.981
Back then,

01:06:33.312 --> 01:06:35.066
whenever I looked at the sky,

01:06:36.778 --> 01:06:38.400
I’d always ask myself

01:06:39.861 --> 01:06:41.765
whether P'Fah was looking at the same sky.

01:06:44.869 --> 01:06:46.256
But today, I got my answer.

01:06:47.786 --> 01:06:49.178
That we’re looking at the same sky.

01:06:54.149 --> 01:06:56.016
Then that means we’re looking at the sky together.

01:08:09.018 --> 01:08:12.026
Phoon, would you like to move in with me?

01:08:12.730 --> 01:08:15.173
- Please?
- Don’t overthink it.

01:08:15.456 --> 01:08:17.584
P'Fah believes your parents will understand.

01:08:18.069 --> 01:08:19.845
I heard there’s an investor in Chiang Mai

01:08:20.037 --> 01:08:21.872
who’s interested in partnering with us.

01:08:22.288 --> 01:08:23.669
They want to discuss the details first.

01:08:25.477 --> 01:08:27.520
You ungrateful brat, a complete waste of everything I’ve given you.

01:08:27.802 --> 01:08:30.106
I should never have let that woman give birth to you.

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:32.800
This is the result of your own actions—take some responsibility for it.

01:08:32.906 --> 01:08:35.274
Don’t think you have to face everything alone anymore.

01:08:35.616 --> 01:08:37.136
Phoon, you’ll always have me.
