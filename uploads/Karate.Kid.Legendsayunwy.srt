01:26:13,794 --> 01:26:15,670
Hey, Johnny, you gotta try
this pizza from New York.

1569
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:18,673
- It's the best I've ever had.
- Why would you ship pizza from New York?

1570
01:26:18,674 --> 01:26:20,466
Everybody knows
the best pizza's in Encino.

1571
01:26:20,467 --> 01:26:22,511
No, there's no comparison. I'm telling ya.

1572
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:25,805
- Wait, dude, that's it.
- What?

1573
01:26:25,806 --> 01:26:28,016
- Our new business idea.
- What are you talking about?

1574
01:26:28,017 --> 01:26:30,977
We open our own pizza place.
We call it Miyagi-Dough.

1575
01:26:30,978 --> 01:26:32,145
Uh, no, no, no, no, no.

1576
01:26:32,146 --> 01:26:35,148
No, get it? Like Miyagi-Do,
but dough, like pizza dough.

1577
01:26:35,149 --> 01:26:37,442
Y-Yeah, yeah, I get it.
It's disrespectful.

1578
01:26:37,443 --> 01:26:39,277
- To pizza?
- To Mr. Miyagi.

1579
01:26:39,278 --> 01:26:40,612
Mr. Miyagi didn't like pizza?

1580
01:26:40,613 --> 01:26:43,115
Yeah, Johnny, you know what?
I'm gonna heat the pizza.

1581
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:46,118
Miyagi-Dough.

1582

Pepperoni's your best defense.

Miyagi-Dough.

1584
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:52,917
Slice first, slice hard, no anchovies.

1585
01:26:53,876 --> 01:26:55,878
This is a billion-dollar idea, LaRusso.

1586
01:26:56,754 --> 01:26:59,005
- Miyagi-Dough. Miyagi-Dough.
