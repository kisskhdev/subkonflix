[Episode 21]

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.750
Let go of me.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:33.430
Shut up.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.000
Lei Lingze?

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.910
Weigui?

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.470
How come you're here?

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.630
I saw people following us,

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.470
so I thought

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:45.520
I could lure them away.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.560
And...

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.470
And I ended up getting caught.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.150
Enough chatting.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.710
Tell me where the Skysplitter is.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.080
Otherwise,

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.150
you'll suffer more

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.430
in the hands

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:58.960
of my sect elders.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.400
The Lingfeng Sect

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.120
prided itself on being a righteous sect.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.630
Yet you are hunting us down

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.560
and going to extreme lengths to get the Skysplitter.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.430
You will be punished soon.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.120
You have the Skysplitter.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.000
You deserve death for stirring unrest in the world.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.800
If you tell me where it is,

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.870
I might spare you.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.910
What do you think?

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.430
I don't know where the Skysplitter is.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.310
What about you?

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.910
I don't know either.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.280
Where is the Skysplitter?

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.310
Where is the Skysplitter?

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:45.800
I do not know.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.910
Lei Lingze!

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.280
You two sure are stubborn.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.360
Let's see who's tougher.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.430
Is it you

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.590
or his neck?

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:11.800
Where is the Skysplitter?

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.520
You're so useless.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:14.800
You can't save Hua Xiaohua

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.960
or Lei Lingze.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:16.480
No.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.870
Kill them all

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.950
and save Lei Lingze.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.430
No.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.240
I can't do that.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:22.950
Too scared?

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.920
Let's go.

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:16.750
We finally got rid of them.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:20.510
Now that

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.430
we are everyone's target,

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.190
they won't let us go easily.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.870
We now

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.600
need to retrieve the Skysplitter

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.160
and return to Lei's Stronghold.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:31.190
My master

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.560
will protect us.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.360
The Skysplitter.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.680
No.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.270
I'm too emotional.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.040
The calming chant cannot suppress it.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.680
If I stay...

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.070
Yes.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.800
The Skysplitter.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:12.750
Once you retrieve the Skysplitter,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.750
we'll leave.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.750
We'll take a boat.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.160
They definitely won't find out.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.560
You unsheathed

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.830
the Skysplitter

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.720
and buried it under Xiaohua's

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.040
tombstone.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.600
You didn't move it, did you?

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.680
Yes.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:30.310
I didn't.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:32.390
I bet

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.630
those simpletons could never imagine

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.510
that we'd hide the sword in Xiaohua's grave.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:45.920
You're not Lei Lingze.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.830
Weigui, what are you doing?

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.920
I am Lei Lingze.

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:56.480
You're not him.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:58.750
Your eyes

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.560
are different from his.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.310
Come out.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:07.510
Ye Zhixin.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.310
You're too smart for your own good.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.720
How boring.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.600
Where is Lei Lingze?

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:28.560
Give me the Skysplitter

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:30.240
and I'll tell you.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.720
I want to make sure Lei Lingze is safe

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.750
before I give it to you.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.310
I see you don't understand your current situation.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.510
I have the bigger negotiation power here.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.070
Give me the sword

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.310
and you'll see him.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:54.680
You don't

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.950
have Lei Lingze.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.070
Are you sure you want to take the risk

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.240
of losing his life?

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:02.830
Weigui!

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.070
- Are you all right? - Are you all right?

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:09.830
Stop!

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:11.240
- Stop! - Hand over the Skysplitter!

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:11.800
Stop!

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.870
- Stop! - Stop!

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:13.800
Stop!

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.240
If you come any further,

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.190
I'll fight you!

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.360
Where are they?

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:26.160
Is this a trick

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.120
to lure me away?

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:29.800
Weigui!

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:38.870
Gentlemen,

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.000
she

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:42.840
is the Sect Leader of Tianwaitian.

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:44.910
Do not let her deceive you.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.630
She poisoned

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:48.480
my good friend.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.080
She stirred up

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:52.240
countless conflicts

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.390
so that we would fight among ourselves for the Skysplitter.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:57.150
Then, she'd swoop in to reap the benefits.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.080
So what?

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.080
She told us where the Skysplitter was.

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:06.910
She is our ally.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.390
Only the strong

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:09.870
can wield the Skysplitter.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.240
You'd better

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:14.030
hand it over right now.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:15.440
Otherwise,

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.480
we're going to fight you.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:20.120
You're crazy.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.150
All of you went crazy

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.000
for the Skysplitter.

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:41.320
You finally figured out

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.480
how to unsheathe it.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.550
I have a technique

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:57.270
taught by the Sword Deity, Li Hanyi,

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:59.720
and my master, Lei Wujie.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:03.870
Its name is Summer Snow.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:04.960
Take it!

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:16.870
I expected a powerful technique.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.150
In reality, it was just some cold wind.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.630
I fear

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:22.000
the Lei's Stronghold

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:24.080
is never going to have a proper heir.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.030
Lei Lingze!

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.440
I will not allow anyone

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.480
to hurt my friend again.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:21.630
Sect Leader.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.240
Weigui ran away with Lei Lingze.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.360
What do we do?

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.480
If 30 men couldn't do it,

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.240
we'll send in 300 men.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:36.550
They will be exhausted one day.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.440
It's only a matter of time

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:40.480
before we capture them.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:41.840
I understand.

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:46.440
After I use the Lingfeng Sect

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.910
to find Weigui and Lei Lingze,

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:51.120
that sect

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.440
will no longer be of use to me.

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:02.200
No.

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:04.320
No.

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:09.150
Stop killing!

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.120
Weigui.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.360
Weigui, you're finally awake.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:19.270
Weigui.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:20.790
Weigui.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:21.870
Weigui.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:25.790
It seems like

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.150
the inner demon has consumed your mind.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.720
I need to help you as soon as possible.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:35.870
The corridor.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.510
The Corridor Keeper must have a way.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:39.720
I'll bring you to him.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:40.720
Come.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:45.220
[Corridor]

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:55.000
Why can't I open it now?

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:58.480
Sir!

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:01.080
I came to seek your help!

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.550
Please open the door!

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:10.200
Sir!

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.550
Please save Weigui.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.270
He is now consumed by his inner demon.

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:16.120
He has lost his sanity.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:20.630
If I can't open it,

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.080
I'll just smash it.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:24.630
You

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:27.120
are still this reckless.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:27.840
Sir,

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:29.750
please save Weigui.

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:31.320
Help him dispel his inner demon

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.360
and bring him back.

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:36.600
Inner demons represent one's inner struggle.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.030
An outsider cannot intervene.

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:40.600
Mr. Lei,

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:42.550
all I can say

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.030
is that only he can save himself

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.240
from his inner demon.

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:49.270
Sir,

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:51.200
if I bring Weigui

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.240
to the source of his inner demon,

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:54.790
will he come back?

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.720
You can try.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.240
Revisiting the trauma can suppress the inner demon temporarily.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.870
Only when you face it,

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.200
can you get rid of it completely.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.240
Thank you, Sir.

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:13.910
Let's go.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.390
We're both injured, and you're

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:25.630
consumed by your inner demon.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:26.790
If we

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:29.150
run into those who want the Skysplitter on the way,

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.750
the consequences will be dire.

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.240
We must make some preparations.
