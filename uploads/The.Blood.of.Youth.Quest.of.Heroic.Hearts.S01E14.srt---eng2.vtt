Lei Lingze.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.720
It's best if you stay here.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.720
Do you all think.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.800
I'm a fool?

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.920
I'm not a fool.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.080
I believe in the way

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.200
of heroism.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.000
And heroism

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.360
is about helping the weak.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.960
The heroism you speak of

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.240
is nothing more than
hot-headed recklessness.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.440
To be a hero,

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.200
one must learn to protect oneself.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.576
So, standing here idly as someone dies

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.000
is what you think a hero should do?

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.680
Unlike you, I'm not someone cold-blooded

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.080

lure me here?

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.120

Do I have the Skysplitter?

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.240
I know your friend has it,
