WEBVTT

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.420
Don't drop crumbs on the tablet.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.130
It's hard to wipe off the grease stains.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:34.820
Got it.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.070
I told you to stop eating.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.910
I have something to say.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.670
What is it?

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.030
Before you started dating me,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.930
did you spend Christmas here alone

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.870
or

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.100
with someone else?

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.680
Why bring up the past?

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.840
Don't ask about things
that have nothing to do with you.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.900
As your boyfriend,
I can't ask that?

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.280
I told you to stop eating.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.680
I'm not going to.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.539
You know I don't eat things like this.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.700
It tastes bad.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.350
It's delicious.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.220
No, it's not. What's good about this?

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.200
Have one more.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.480
No.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.280
Just one more.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.220
Wait.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.480
I have an idea.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:12.520
Look here.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.290
You look so funny.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.790
Let me see.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.300
Isn't it a good photo?

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.650
What are you doing?

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.440
Only you look good in this photo.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.470
What do you mean?

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.230
I'm going to delete it.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.100
Why?

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.660
I look so ugly in it.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.910
Wait.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.170
I'm going to delete it.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.230
Merry Christmas!

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.790
Who is he?

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.400
Why are you here?

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:02.750
It's Christmas.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.920
I'm here to celebrate with you.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.520
I didn't ask you to come.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:11.560
Wow.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.560
Look at that face.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.230
Hey.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.530
You're so cold.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:16.420
Hello.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.680
You're Haejun, right?

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.680
Jaehun told me a lot about you.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.570
You're cuter than I expected.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.120
Can I come in?

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.680
As if you ever asked for my permission.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.579
One should drink mulled wine
in winter.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.740
I know there are a lot of good wines here,

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.220
but I picked this myself—

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.750
it has a different meaning.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:41.680
But

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.329
isn't this wine really expensive?

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:44.450
He's rich.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.250
Oh, right!

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.230
I forgot something in my car.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.220
Hey.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.810
Go get it.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.230
The car is parked at the door.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.360
Go get it.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.240
Are you crazy?

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.040
You go.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.110
You go.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.650
Let me get that.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.430
Go get it.
Your friend wants you to get it.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.350
Just once.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.860
Okay?

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.610
Don't do anything stupid.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.130
You're Haejun, right?

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.420
I'm Kang Soohyung.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.920
Jaehun and I

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.920
have been friends since childhood.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.840
It's not easy for you

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.840
to be here today.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:01.780
Hyung!

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.260
It really suits you.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:16.480
Let's wear it together.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.240
I bought it for Christmas.

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.340
The size is just right too.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.040
Why do you like clothes like this?

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.230
What do you mean?

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.100
I've fulfilled your request.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:15.640
It's my turn now.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:17.910
No.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.720
Why not?

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.930
You said you'd listen to me.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.080
Why not?

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.500
Huh?

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.090
I've fulfilled all your requirements.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.310
Jaehun

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.080
has high self-esteem.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:51.850
He didn't tell you

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.630
about his past, right?

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.690
Don't you want to know

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.990
how he became a sadist?

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:05.320
When Jaehun was a kid,

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.200
he suffered severe
abuse from his family.

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.130
His father pushed him into the water

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.510
to stop him from crying.

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.530
In order to erase that memory,

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.430
he decided to be the one
in control of others.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.020
Aren't you going to have dinner
before you leave?

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.300
Look at his face.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.660
He was clearly telling me to leave.

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:34.600
Remember

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.909
what I just said.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.900
Be careful,

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:40.930
kid.

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:33.870
Don't move.

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:36.920
This is perfect.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.550
Shall I take off my clothes too?

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:43.250
No.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.800
This is perfect.

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.730
Weird.

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:10.630
What's wrong?

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.850
I can draw you.

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:16.710
But I can't draw

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.520
the emotions in your eyes.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:21.860
It feels like

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:24.970
it's covered in fog.

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:41.930
Stop drawing.

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.100
You need to experience it yourself
to draw it well.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.330
Lean forward.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:29.700
Can you see the emotions

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:30.700
in my eyes?

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:38.910
They're burning.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:43.950
What about the fog?

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:47.540
It's gone.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.270
Now, my name

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:02.250
is on your body.

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:12.680
Oh no, my painting.

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:17.780
It's just a painting.

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:21.350
I have to submit this to the professor.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.500
I drew you so well too.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.030
Don't worry. You have plenty of time.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:27.860
No matter how much you draw,

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.660
I'll be by your side.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.930
No matter how much you draw,

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:39.600
I'll be by your side.

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:02.490
What now?

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:09.310
Got it.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.450
I'll be right there.

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:16.160
I'll be right back.

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:17.590
Go take a shower.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:51.270
If it's nothing important,

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:52.580
I'm leaving.

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:56.140
I don't know if this is important,

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:58.650
but you'll be interested.

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:01.830
Have a seat.

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:14.100
Did I

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:16.040
disturb you?

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:21.210
No.

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:24.380
As long as there is someone,

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:26.310
I can have fun anytime.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:28.480
How nice, to have

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.340
a long-term bed partner.

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:32.870
You're one to talk.

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:35.360
People queue up for you.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.280
Well, they have to be to my taste.

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:44.080
So what is it?

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:47.140
I went to Gyeonggi today,

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.100
so I dropped by your house.

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:53.930
Your housekeeper has gotten old.

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.100
But

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:58.070
he still remembers you.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:00.990
He said he found this

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:03.240
when he was cleaning your room.

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:45.880
How should I search?

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.420
[Han Jaehun]

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.300
[Han Jaehun]

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:01.550
I can't find anything
when I search his name.

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.470
Why is nothing coming up?

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:38.320
I went to Gyeonggi today,

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.220
so I dropped by your house.

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:45.010
Your housekeeper has gotten old.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.400
He sewed and cleaned it himself,

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:57.350
and kept it until now.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.120
He thought you might come back someday.

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:04.460
This is...

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:08.770
The housekeeper said

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:11.300
he mended all the broken parts

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:12.740
on it.

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:15.570
He cleaned it regularly every month too.

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:17.310
He thought

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.310
you might come back someday.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.230
Has my mom been well

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:48.510
since then?

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.370
From what I heard,

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.660
she moved abroad alone.

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:01.470
But she passed away.

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:07.680
But...

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:10.220
I heard that she lived

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:11.820
quite a free life since then.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:26.680
Got it.

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:29.040
Thank you so much.

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:32.370
If you want to thank me,

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:34.650
you should show some appreciation.

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:37.340
What do you want?

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.820
For example,

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.160
introduce me

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.420
to that kid in your house.

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.020
Don't touch him.

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:57.520
Okay, okay.

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:01.550
I don't have those thoughts for now.

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:04.980
I'll tell you when I do.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:14.500
Bye.

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:27.010
Oops, I got him good.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.990
Kim Haejun,

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:32.290
what are you going to do now?

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:33.370
Mom.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:37.860
Dad and I...

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:39.800
No.

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:43.380
Am I that much like

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.840
that person?

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:53.380
Is that why you never came back?

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:02.680
Jaehun-hyung!

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:04.920
Are you in there?

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:08.350
Are you okay?

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:11.320
I smell smoke.

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:13.710
I'm fine, Haejun.

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:15.740
Go to sleep.

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:25.480
Okay.

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:31.120
Let me

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:34.740
warm you up.

00:26:58.030 --> 00:26:58.830
Do you like it?

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:49.980
