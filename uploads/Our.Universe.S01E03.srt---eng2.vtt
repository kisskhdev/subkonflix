That clip has over a thousand views
on the internal board,

00:21:58.973 --> 00:22:00.725
and my team talks about it
every time we're at the cafeteria,

00:22:00.725 --> 00:22:03.227
wondering which team the new hire is from.

00:22:03.227 --> 00:22:04.457

They say the boiler repair is expensive.

what the problem is.

00:23:45.079 --> 00:23:48.332
It's the motor. The motor.

00:23:48.332 --> 00:23:49.876
- The motor?
- The motor.

I don't think that's it.

Are you sure you actually know
how to fix this?

00:23:54.556 --> 00:23:58.093
Hey, my nickname's MacGyver.

00:23:58.093 --> 00:24:00.386
I've got a long education behind me.
I know this stuff.

00:24:00.386 --> 00:24:01.721
I've got connections too.

00:24:01.721 --> 00:24:05.314
The police chief is my buddy.

00:24:05.314 --> 00:24:07.554
Got it?

00:24:08.227 --> 00:24:10.354
Then why are you home?

00:24:10.354 --> 00:24:13.957
It's a weekday. Everyone's at work.

00:24:16.561 --> 00:24:17.720
Then what about you?

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.163
You look perfectly fine.

00:24:19.163 --> 00:24:21.821
Why are you home at this hour?

00:24:23.466 --> 00:24:25.418
I'm...

00:24:26.454 --> 00:24:27.872
On parental leave.

00:24:27.872 --> 00:24:29.332
- Parental leave?
- Yeah.

00:24:29.332 --> 00:24:31.740
- For Woo Joo?
- Yes.

00:24:34.212 --> 00:24:36.745
Now that I think about it, who are you exactly?

00:24:36.745 --> 00:24:38.132
I know Woo Joo,

00:24:38.132 --> 00:24:40.320
but I've never seen you.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.178
I've seen the lady of this house a few times,

00:24:42.178 --> 00:24:44.964
but I've never seen you.

00:37:55.015 --> 00:37:56.435
Does this make any sense?

00:37:56.435 --> 00:37:57.828
I don't know.

00:37:57.828 --> 00:37:59.266
Sun Tae Hyung, where did you...

00:37:59.266 --> 00:38:00.994
Where did he go, Woo Joo?

00:38:00.994 --> 00:38:03.757
- Woo Joo.
- Peekaboo.

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:19.643
I knew you'd show up.

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.589
That one million you mentioned before,

00:38:22.589 --> 00:38:23.989
it's getting transferred today, right?

00:38:23.989 --> 00:38:25.124
Of course.

00:38:25.124 --> 00:38:27.857
As soon as we're done.

00:38:27.857 --> 00:38:30.054
It's the first time in ten years

00:38:30.054 --> 00:38:31.840
a place was chosen this fast.

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:34.090
It's all thanks to you.

00:38:35.185 --> 00:38:37.685
Now today,

00:38:37.685 --> 00:38:39.685
there's just one thing you need to remember.

00:38:39.685 --> 00:38:40.721
What is it?

00:38:40.721 --> 00:38:42.268
Never...

00:38:42.268 --> 00:38:44.455
Show off.

00:38:44.455 --> 00:38:46.175
Just because you've done this work before,

00:38:46.175 --> 00:38:47.376
don't touch anything.

00:38:47.376 --> 00:38:49.016
Amy Choo hates that the most.

00:38:49.016 --> 00:38:50.333
No opinions. No ego.

00:38:50.333 --> 00:38:52.152
Just say "yes, yes, got it."

00:38:52.152 --> 00:38:53.565
Got it?

00:38:53.565 --> 00:38:55.456
Yes, yes, got it.

00:38:55.456 --> 00:38:56.592
Okay.

00:38:56.592 --> 00:38:58.672
Just get through it without messing up.

00:38:58.672 --> 00:38:59.872
Please.

00:38:59.872 --> 00:39:01.536
I'm begging you.

00:39:01.536 --> 00:39:03.468
I'm going in.

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:08.311
- Let's skip this one entirely.
- Okay.

00:39:08.311 --> 00:39:10.891
Could you look at the camera, please?

00:39:14.716 --> 00:39:16.196
Let's get some light on the face.

00:39:16.196 --> 00:39:18.678
Please move the reflector slightly to the left.

00:39:18.678 --> 00:39:20.013
Is this position okay?

00:39:20.013 --> 00:39:22.340
Yes, one moment.

00:39:32.359 --> 00:39:34.899
Turn your head slightly to the left.

00:39:34.899 --> 00:39:36.471
Should we adjust the key light a bit?

00:39:36.471 --> 00:39:37.519
Sorry?

00:39:37.519 --> 00:39:39.632
Oh yes, yes.

00:39:41.442 --> 00:39:43.934
A little more to the right.

00:39:54.923 --> 00:39:56.842
Hello, guys.

00:39:56.842 --> 00:39:59.489
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:39:59.489 --> 00:40:00.799
How's the lighting setup?

00:40:00.799 --> 00:40:01.930
All set.

00:40:01.930 --> 00:40:04.865
Key light is locked in.

00:40:04.865 --> 00:40:06.691
Who are you?

00:40:06.691 --> 00:40:08.810
Just a day hire.

00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:10.377
I don't use assistants. Leave.

00:40:10.377 --> 00:40:11.476
No.

00:40:11.476 --> 00:40:13.882
I need to make that million.

00:40:15.459 --> 00:40:18.216
- Hey...
- I can't do this!

00:40:18.216 --> 00:40:20.816
I'm not shooting!

00:40:20.816 --> 00:40:22.909
Are you trying to screw me over?

00:40:22.909 --> 00:40:25.121
Or push me even further down?

00:40:25.121 --> 00:40:26.830
I already got branded as the affair girl,

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:28.795
lost every ad deal I had.

00:40:28.795 --> 00:40:30.906
Are you insane?

00:40:30.906 --> 00:40:32.182
I can't do this.

00:40:32.182 --> 00:40:34.635
Change the shoot concept!

00:40:35.735 --> 00:40:38.045
Then get out.

00:40:38.045 --> 00:40:41.708
I don't work with people
who don't trust my camera.

00:40:47.213 --> 00:40:50.770
I don't care if you had an affair or not.

00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:54.434
I don't care what's real or fake
in your private life.

00:40:54.434 --> 00:40:55.847
But when you came to me,

00:40:55.847 --> 00:40:59.656
you were asking me
to show who you are right now.

00:40:59.656 --> 00:41:01.683
You don't have to trust me.

00:41:01.683 --> 00:41:04.830
But you do have to trust my camera.

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:06.222
From this moment on,

00:41:06.222 --> 00:41:09.207
I'm using my camera to change

00:41:09.207 --> 00:41:12.127
how people see you.

00:41:12.127 --> 00:41:14.033
So, what now?

00:41:14.669 --> 00:41:17.148
The choice is yours.

00:41:22.969 --> 00:41:24.888
Chin, just a little.

00:41:24.888 --> 00:41:26.531
Camera.

00:41:29.226 --> 00:41:31.061
Good.

00:41:52.645 --> 00:41:53.856
What are you doing?

00:41:53.856 --> 00:41:56.515
After five, the natural light drops off.

00:41:56.515 --> 00:41:59.635
But then the neon signs spill inward instead.

00:41:59.635 --> 00:42:01.758
It gives the subject a strong back tone,

00:42:01.758 --> 00:42:05.191
which works really well for evening shots.

00:42:05.191 --> 00:42:09.535
You are going for high contrast, right?

00:42:09.535 --> 00:42:10.782
Like...

00:42:10.782 --> 00:42:14.289
the 2018 Tesser cover shoot.

00:42:15.407 --> 00:42:16.683
So...

00:42:16.683 --> 00:42:19.943
you adjusted things without my direction?

00:42:21.287 --> 00:42:23.322
I know you hate it...

00:42:23.322 --> 00:42:25.569
- when people overstep on set.
- And?

00:42:25.569 --> 00:42:28.060
I'm just a one-day temp.

00:42:28.778 --> 00:42:31.698
So I do not have to play it safe.

00:42:31.698 --> 00:42:35.394
I will just pull the edge and drop the key.

00:42:35.394 --> 00:42:38.817
You like it a little rough in color anyway.

00:42:39.629 --> 00:42:41.494
So...

00:42:41.494 --> 00:42:43.987
Can I keep going?

00:42:47.095 --> 00:42:49.695
The launch date for our new product
has been finalized.

00:42:49.695 --> 00:42:53.052
As you all know, the domestic HMR market
is already saturated.

00:42:53.052 --> 00:42:55.813
Without clear differentiation,
it will be hard to gain market share.

00:42:55.813 --> 00:42:58.574
So we need detailed strategies
by distribution channel...

00:42:58.574 --> 00:42:59.655
Oh.

00:42:59.655 --> 00:43:01.427
Manager, does that mean

00:43:01.427 --> 00:43:04.154
we are reconsidering overseas expansion?

00:43:04.154 --> 00:43:05.674
Yes.

00:43:05.674 --> 00:43:07.627
Since this is our first launch,

00:43:07.627 --> 00:43:10.410
I think we should focus on
building brand awareness.

00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:11.453
Right.

00:43:11.453 --> 00:43:13.954
Securing a strong domestic response
does come first...

00:43:13.954 --> 00:43:15.621
But still,

00:43:15.621 --> 00:43:17.694
is this not an opportunity?

00:43:17.694 --> 00:43:19.669
Based on the materials you put together,

00:43:19.669 --> 00:43:21.455
the timing looks right.

00:43:21.455 --> 00:43:25.575
We should not miss this opportunity this time.

00:43:29.152 --> 00:43:31.972
Thank you.

00:43:48.519 --> 00:43:50.439
Amy Choo?

00:43:50.439 --> 00:43:52.464
You really worked as her assistant?

00:43:52.464 --> 00:43:55.045
- So you're her first assistant ever.
- Don't get carried away.

00:43:55.045 --> 00:43:56.465
It was just a one-day gig.

00:43:56.465 --> 00:43:58.666
She used to be your role model, right?

00:43:58.666 --> 00:44:01.022
How does this happen right after you quit?

00:44:01.022 --> 00:44:03.421
Well, I tried it once. That is enough for me.

00:44:03.421 --> 00:44:05.127
You said you were done with photography.

00:44:05.127 --> 00:44:07.361
But you still went to the shoot. Why?

00:44:07.361 --> 00:44:08.652
Nothing.

00:44:08.652 --> 00:44:11.151
Just a one-night dream.

00:44:11.151 --> 00:44:12.414
You know me.

00:44:12.414 --> 00:44:14.415
I choose reality over dreams.

00:44:14.415 --> 00:44:15.655
Either way,

00:44:15.655 --> 00:44:18.261
mission accomplished.

00:44:18.261 --> 00:44:20.605
Starting tomorrow, we finally get hot water.

00:44:20.605 --> 00:44:23.051
Hot water?

00:44:23.051 --> 00:44:25.193
There are things I can't fully explain.

00:44:25.193 --> 00:44:26.686
That is what parenting is like.

00:44:26.686 --> 00:44:29.276
It is always full of variables.

00:44:29.276 --> 00:44:31.578
Come on, kid. Let's go.

00:44:48.074 --> 00:44:50.153
Ms. Woo Hyun Jin.

00:44:51.628 --> 00:44:53.781
Let's call it a day.

00:44:54.864 --> 00:44:56.914
Yes.

00:45:06.296 --> 00:45:08.249
Floor 1.

00:45:15.847 --> 00:45:18.149
Cancel Floor 1.

00:45:20.282 --> 00:45:22.408
I'll give you a ride.

00:45:29.214 --> 00:45:31.655
- Here is one million won in cash.
- Yeah.

00:45:31.655 --> 00:45:33.551
You should have hot water from now on.

00:45:33.551 --> 00:45:35.937
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:38.286
Thank you. Bye.

00:45:38.286 --> 00:45:40.201
Bye.

00:45:48.964 --> 00:45:50.983
Why does housework pile up like this

00:45:50.983 --> 00:45:54.571
just from taking one day off?

00:45:59.683 --> 00:46:01.525
Wait...

00:46:04.113 --> 00:46:06.146
Hey, kid.

00:46:07.911 --> 00:46:09.925
Hey.

00:46:11.372 --> 00:46:13.652
All of this?

00:46:23.677 --> 00:46:26.382
I'm not waiting for you anymore.

00:46:26.382 --> 00:46:28.452
This time,

00:46:28.452 --> 00:46:30.839
I'm the one leaving you behind.

00:47:01.285 --> 00:47:03.915
When did you move here?

00:47:05.064 --> 00:47:07.181
Well...

00:47:08.774 --> 00:47:11.907
It's been a while.

00:47:11.907 --> 00:47:13.942
When was it?

00:47:15.773 --> 00:47:18.907
It's really been a long time, hasn't it?

00:47:20.888 --> 00:47:22.979
About seven years?

00:47:22.979 --> 00:47:25.439
Since we went our separate ways...

00:47:31.395 --> 00:47:33.482
Yeah.

00:47:34.242 --> 00:47:37.577
We haven't seen each other once since then.

00:47:37.577 --> 00:47:38.952
I never thought

00:47:38.952 --> 00:47:42.012
I'd run into you like this.

00:47:43.119 --> 00:47:45.121
Yeah.

00:47:45.121 --> 00:47:48.793
I didn't expect to see you again on my team.

00:47:50.032 --> 00:47:52.492
I thought you'd completely forgotten about me.

00:47:52.492 --> 00:47:54.530
You never even acknowledged me at work.

00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:57.497
So that bothered you?

00:48:01.857 --> 00:48:03.367
No.

00:48:03.367 --> 00:48:05.392
That's not what I mean.

00:48:05.392 --> 00:48:07.283
Anyway...

00:48:07.949 --> 00:48:10.652
Let's do well from here on out.

00:48:23.742 --> 00:48:25.662
I lied to him again.

00:48:25.662 --> 00:48:28.024
Back then or now,

00:48:28.024 --> 00:48:30.564
you're always the same, Woo Hyun Jin.

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:44.626
Woo Hyun Jin.

00:48:44.626 --> 00:48:46.484
I...

00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:53.607
You can take that.

00:48:53.607 --> 00:48:56.313
Bad timing...

00:48:57.992 --> 00:49:00.498
Just a second.

00:49:16.384 --> 00:49:18.384
Yoon Seong.

00:49:19.090 --> 00:49:22.436
I told you earlier I had something to say.

00:49:23.534 --> 00:49:25.741
Actually...

00:49:27.933 --> 00:49:30.579
I'm leaving soon for a language program.

00:49:33.229 --> 00:49:35.239
So...

00:49:38.155 --> 00:49:41.335
I don't think we can see each other anymore.

00:50:11.478 --> 00:50:14.804
Leave it. I'll clean it up later.

00:50:17.744 --> 00:50:20.242
Did you get caught in the rain?

00:50:20.859 --> 00:50:22.623
Didn't you have an umbrella?

00:50:22.623 --> 00:50:24.334
What happened to you?

00:50:24.334 --> 00:50:26.169
What's going on with this place?

00:50:26.169 --> 00:50:28.315
Well...

00:50:29.078 --> 00:50:32.010
I had stuff going on today too.

00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:34.082
I had an appointment.

00:50:34.082 --> 00:50:35.309
An appointment?

00:50:35.309 --> 00:50:37.793
So you went out today?

00:50:37.793 --> 00:50:38.949
Then what about Woo Joo?

00:50:38.949 --> 00:50:41.838
I left the baby somewhere safe,
just for a bit...

00:50:41.838 --> 00:50:43.953
Hey, in-law.

00:50:43.953 --> 00:50:46.003
Isn't this against what we agreed on?

00:50:46.003 --> 00:50:47.344
Agreed on what?

00:50:47.344 --> 00:50:48.526
Yes.

00:50:48.526 --> 00:50:50.752
You said you'd keep the place clean.

00:50:50.752 --> 00:50:52.638
That was the deal.

00:50:52.638 --> 00:50:54.185
And if you take him out like today,

00:50:54.185 --> 00:50:56.728
- you're supposed to tell me.
- Tell you?

00:50:56.728 --> 00:50:59.943
Do you even know why I went out today?

00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:05.838
I did something I never do,
because of this place.

00:51:05.838 --> 00:51:09.173
I picked up a camera
for the first time in three years.

00:51:09.173 --> 00:51:10.246
A camera?

00:51:10.246 --> 00:51:11.910
Okay, listen.

00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:13.328
When I moved in here,

00:51:13.328 --> 00:51:16.110
I set one condition, right?

00:51:16.110 --> 00:51:18.515
That no one goes into my space.

00:51:18.515 --> 00:51:22.342
But today the kid went into my room
and my camera...

00:51:23.361 --> 00:51:25.361
No.

00:51:25.361 --> 00:51:27.676
Let's stop.

00:51:27.676 --> 00:51:29.256
Ever since I started living with you,

00:51:29.256 --> 00:51:31.050
everything keeps going wrong.

00:51:31.050 --> 00:51:33.867
Because of me?

00:51:33.867 --> 00:51:35.943
I'm the one who's getting labeled at work

00:51:35.943 --> 00:51:37.129
because of you.

00:51:37.129 --> 00:51:39.282
I've been sick for days,
and today I didn't even get to shower.

00:51:39.282 --> 00:51:40.362
So...

00:51:40.362 --> 00:51:43.044
That's why I took a side job.

00:51:43.044 --> 00:51:45.487
The baby looks like a mess.
The place looks like a mess.

00:51:45.487 --> 00:51:48.073
- And you look like a mess too.
- Mess?

00:51:48.073 --> 00:51:49.627
Did you just call me a mess?

00:51:49.627 --> 00:51:52.460
You really just said that to me...

00:51:55.370 --> 00:51:57.301
Yes, you're right.

00:51:57.301 --> 00:52:00.977
I look terrible, don't I?

00:52:00.977 --> 00:52:03.766
I know I'm a mess.

00:52:03.766 --> 00:52:06.048
Hey, that's not...

00:52:06.048 --> 00:52:07.175
what I meant.

00:52:07.175 --> 00:52:09.093
I didn't even get to shower,

00:52:09.093 --> 00:52:11.214
so I looked like a total mess
in front of him today.

00:52:11.214 --> 00:52:13.773
I know I looked awful.

00:52:13.773 --> 00:52:14.849
"Him?"

00:52:14.849 --> 00:52:16.980
And I got completely soaked in the rain.

00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:18.353
So go inside and shower.

00:52:18.353 --> 00:52:19.639
The water's freezing.

00:52:19.639 --> 00:52:21.657
Cold showers are brutal, you know.

00:52:21.657 --> 00:52:23.059
It's fixed.

00:52:23.059 --> 00:52:26.485
I called a repair guy today. You can wash.

00:52:27.339 --> 00:52:29.465
Really?

00:52:56.659 --> 00:52:58.212
Why are you drinking beer

00:52:58.212 --> 00:53:00.619
without any food?

00:53:03.582 --> 00:53:05.542
Want one?

00:53:10.045 --> 00:53:14.085
Honestly, I'm in the mood for soju today,

00:53:14.085 --> 00:53:16.579
but we didn't have any.

00:53:20.707 --> 00:53:23.420
Hold on.

00:53:30.359 --> 00:53:32.152
No soju, but instead,

00:53:32.152 --> 00:53:36.169
Château de Lyon Elegance Sauvignon...

00:53:36.169 --> 00:53:38.978
It's the budget version.

00:53:39.841 --> 00:53:42.644
Wine just feels right

00:53:42.644 --> 00:53:45.077
on a rainy day.

00:53:45.077 --> 00:53:47.830
Wait, we don't have wine glasses?

00:53:49.085 --> 00:53:51.398
Thanks.

00:54:02.826 --> 00:54:04.380
Actually,

00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:07.293
I kind of wanted a drink today too.

00:54:11.878 --> 00:54:14.281
You know what?

00:54:14.281 --> 00:54:18.021
I usually love rainy days.

00:54:20.307 --> 00:54:23.542
Why do you like rainy days?

00:54:23.542 --> 00:54:25.979
Your shoes get soaked.

00:54:25.979 --> 00:54:28.440
Your clothes get soaked.

00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:31.432
It just puts you in a bad mood.

00:54:31.432 --> 00:54:32.934
Exactly.

00:54:32.934 --> 00:54:35.725
I was in a bad mood today too.

00:54:35.725 --> 00:54:38.338
I got completely soaked, and...

00:54:39.431 --> 00:54:42.125
maybe it's because I lied.

00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:44.230
But

00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:46.215
thanks to the boiler you fixed,

00:54:46.215 --> 00:54:48.763
I took a warm bath,

00:54:48.763 --> 00:54:51.254
and it helped calm me down.

00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:56.552
But where did you get the money?

00:54:56.552 --> 00:54:58.930
You said you didn't have any.

00:54:58.930 --> 00:55:00.743
Hey, in-law.

00:55:00.743 --> 00:55:02.174
I do own a house, you know.

00:55:02.174 --> 00:55:03.553
And today,

00:55:03.553 --> 00:55:04.976
I...

00:55:04.976 --> 00:55:07.832
I fixed it with what I made
from a one-day part-time job.

00:55:09.147 --> 00:55:11.672
But still...

00:55:11.672 --> 00:55:14.727
I don't really have money right now.

00:55:15.807 --> 00:55:19.073
Can I pay you back
in five monthly installments?

00:55:20.116 --> 00:55:21.589
Fine.

00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:23.878
I'll be moving out soon anyway.

00:55:23.878 --> 00:55:25.484
Do you want to keep seeing me

00:55:25.484 --> 00:55:27.465
for five more months?

00:55:27.465 --> 00:55:30.436
Let's just live like this for now

00:55:30.436 --> 00:55:32.981
and not get any more involved.

00:55:32.981 --> 00:55:35.780
That's what I want.

00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:36.878
Living with you,

00:55:36.878 --> 00:55:38.644
everything keeps going wrong for me too.

00:55:38.644 --> 00:55:39.887
I want it to stop.

00:55:39.887 --> 00:55:41.754
I feel the same way.

00:55:41.754 --> 00:55:44.232
Things get even more messed up because of you.

00:55:44.232 --> 00:55:46.269
Let's stop getting involved.

00:55:46.269 --> 00:55:49.219
Let's keep clear boundaries.

00:55:49.219 --> 00:55:52.392
Let's get through
the rest of the time peacefully.

00:56:36.394 --> 00:56:38.986
My head...

00:57:01.230 --> 00:57:04.074
Too bright...

00:57:09.143 --> 00:57:11.705
Why are you here?

00:57:11.705 --> 00:57:15.118
Why are you sleeping in my arms?

00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:21.700
What? You slept with him?

00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:25.046
What did you do to me?

00:58:26.059 --> 00:58:27.110
Wait,

00:58:27.110 --> 00:58:30.387
does he look like a man to you
now that you slept with him?

00:58:30.387 --> 00:58:32.284
Do you think she's beautiful?

00:58:32.284 --> 00:58:34.028
Are you really okay with this?

00:58:34.028 --> 00:58:35.428
What's wrong with you?

00:58:35.428 --> 00:58:37.441
How about writing the initial proposal?

00:58:37.441 --> 00:58:38.498
Yeah, sir.

00:58:38.498 --> 00:58:40.258
Just until this project is over.

00:58:40.258 --> 00:58:42.419
Please take care of Woo Joo a little longer.

00:58:42.419 --> 00:58:44.565
Why did that manager walk you home?

00:58:44.565 --> 00:58:46.175
I wanted to spend the night with you.

00:58:46.175 --> 00:58:48.777
It was driving me crazy the whole time.
