Haejun, what are you doing?

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.540
Nothing much.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.270
I'm painting.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.930
We haven't seen each other for days.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.430
Don't you miss me?

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.610
I do.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.080
But we just met two days ago.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.270
Come on.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.680
I miss you even when I don't see you
only for a day.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.010
All I think about is you—

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.960
I can't do anything else.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.960
Well,

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.050
shall we meet tomorrow?

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.720
I need to go get my report card.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.670
I don't want to go alone.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.930
Your report card?

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.050
What should I do?

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.430
Something came up
and I need to go somewhere.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.570
So suddenly?

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.430
Where are you going?

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.430
Did something happen?

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.180
It's nothing serious.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.960
I have to go now,

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.080
to meet an old friend.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.010
I'll be away...

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.700
for about a week—

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.680
it might be even longer.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:32.759
Then...

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.090
you'll be away for Christmas too?

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.810
Got it.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.280
Take care.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.670
What was I expecting?

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.800
Christmas is just around the corner.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.680

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.100
Hello, Professor.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.440
You came in last in this final exam.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.800
This'll affect your graduation.
Your mom will be worried too.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.130
There will be online classes in winter,
so sign up for those.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.480
Okay, thank you.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.240
I'll study hard.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.140
If you say useless things like that again,

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.140
I'll only give you iced Americano.

You didn't expect me to come, did you?

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:06.730
Are you at home alone?

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:07.530
Soyu.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.680
Why are you here?

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.700
Can't I just come?

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.710
Or is there someone at home?

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.190
No, that's not it.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.930
That's great then, if you're alone.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.930
I missed you so much today.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.720
You didn't reply to my messages,

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.120
and I was worried you weren't home.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.910
So I kept having bad thoughts.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.680
Ta-da!

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.960
How is it? Not bad, right?

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.200
When I put this on, I was thinking

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.490
if you would say I look pretty in it.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:44.590
It's pretty.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:46.350
But...

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.800
aren't you cold?

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.930
No.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:51.530
It's fine.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.350

This is a gift.

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.430
I bought it with the money
I earned from my part-time job.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.830
I just don't want you
to receive this from others.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:14.410
I can't take it.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.070
Please just take it.

Don't feel burdened.

My birthday is in a few days,

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.220

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.220
So I wanted to ask you this:

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.060
Haejun,

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.800
can you spend this Christmas with me?

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.330
You don't have to answer me right away.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:45.060
I just

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.110
hope you can understand how sincere

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.260

Contact me.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:54.970
It's fine if it's short

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.530
or a rejection—

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.360
no, it's not fine—

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.540

It's my first time

You haven't been on many trips?

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.450
From elementary school to college,

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.050
I stayed in the same area.

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:29.660
but my mom got sick,
and I couldn't leave.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:36.030
You're not disappointed that
you're going on a trip with me, right?

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:36.830
Of course not.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.570
I'm glad I'm going with you.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:41.550
So...

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:46.640
To a place

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:49.230
where no one knows us.

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:31.790
I want to spend Christmas together
with him in a house like this too.

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:36.780
Why are you spacing out?

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:40.420
Do you like it?

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.960
Are we going to spend Christmas here?

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.160
Just the two of us?

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:46.540
Yes.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:47.770
Why?

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:49.310
You don't like it?

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:50.810
No.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.380
It just doesn't feel real.

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:58.260
This is the resort

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.080
my mom left me.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.160
I have someone
to take care of it regularly.

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:06.860
Whenever I want to be alone,
I'd come here.

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:11.970
Your mother

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.460
must be a warm person.

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:22.420
Close your eyes.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.840

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:38.480
Isn't it pretty?

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:40.530
What is...

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:41.500
this?

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:43.950
An ankle cuff.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.150
Isn't it pretty?

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:48.030
Is it a gift?

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:49.480
Yes.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:53.900
Wait.

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:05.490
After putting this on,

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:07.480
no matter where you are,

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.120
or where you go,

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.520
I will know.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.740
Isn't it weird?

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:17.920
Not at all.

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.180
I think it's sexy.

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:23.190
But...

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.100
it'll be inconvenient when I go out.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:29.270
Go out?

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.780
Where do you want to go?

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.930
No, that's not what I meant.

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.880
Wherever you go,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.150
or whoever you meet,

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:07.750
you must stay in my line of sight,

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:10.310
got it?

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:12.110
Yes.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.910
Good boy.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.700
Hello, Professor.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:43.500
Yes, I got the documents.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:46.360
Yes, I'll study hard.

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:49.940
Yes, I'll study hard.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:51.790
Yes.

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:58.940
Your school is still reaching out to you
even though it's vacation?

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:00.570
Actually,

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:05.069
there's something I didn't tell you.

00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:08.730
My grades were not good,

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:13.490
so I have to attend online classes
during winter vacation.

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:24.550
So you're a problematic student.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:25.849
That's not true.

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:28.329
Hand.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:32.090
Come with me.

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:37.070
Where are we going?

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:53.890
Did your mother like painting too?

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.240
This is the studio I prepared for you.

00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:59.240
I thought you might need it.

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:01.360
Paint whatever you want.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.590
It's great!

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.250
The paint is new and the frame is new too.

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.190
You must have prepared it
for a long time.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:10.330
How is it?

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:12.070
Do you like it?

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:14.920
It feels like a dream.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.030
Does me being nice to you

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.870
feel that unreal?

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:22.670
It's just...

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.590
difficult to believe.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:29.560
Even so,

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.280
it's important

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:34.800
that I appear in your dream, right?

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:36.050
Even so,

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.950
you should appear
a lot in my real life too.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:44.030
I need a few more plaster statues.

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:46.740
Plaster statues?

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:50.960
You have me.

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:53.770
Why do you need plaster statues?

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:54.570
Do...

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:57.100
Do you still think I'm not good enough?

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:58.520
No.

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:02.090
If I paint you, I'll be shy.

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:03.850
And you're so busy.

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:07.910
Come here.

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:14.570
Don't feel burdened.

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:18.990
I don't do things like this
to ask for anything in return.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:21.470
Still...

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:25.570
I don't know how to repay you.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.950
There's no need.

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:32.200
I only want

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.700
you to listen to me.

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:36.470
Understand?

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:56.190
Yes.

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:57.660
Hey, Han Jaehun.

00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:59.490
Don't you miss me?

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:02.890
We met not long ago. What's up?

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:06.980
Must there be a reason for me to call you?

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.230
I'm in Seoul.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.480
I'm going to stay here for a while.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.550
You're not...

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:16.080
asking me to help you
look for a place to stay, right?

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.090
That's nothing difficult.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.200
Why don't we just live together?

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:21.600
Just kidding.

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:24.370
Do you want to grab a drink?

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:25.370
Where are you?

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.080
Same old place.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:29.540
I heard there are many new faces.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.250
Let's meet today.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.340
Okay, I'll be right there.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:47.470
Are you

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:48.400
going out?

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:49.870
Who are you meeting?

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.060
I'm just meeting a friend.

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:55.410
When are you coming back?

00:20:58.810 --> 00:20:59.880
It's a secret.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.120
It won't be late.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.880
There's food in the fridge
if you're hungry.

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:07.850
Okay.

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:11.890
Don't eat bread with jam.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.210
You've gained weight.

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:14.360
Got it.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:16.690
I'm heading off.

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.990
Give me a kiss.

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:21.940
No need.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:22.670
I'm leaving.

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:25.040
Go ahead. Come home early.

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:32.940
[Minwoo]

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:40.400
Minwoo, it's me.

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:41.940
I'm back in Korea.

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.920
Aren't you with Jaehun?

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:48.310
I thought you were already together.

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:52.700
Okay, I'll stop teasing you.

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:55.640
I'm meeting Jaehun today.

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:58.220
I'll get some information for you.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:21:59.850
Okay.

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:06.960
Han Jaehun.

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:09.630
I hope you're just as you were before.

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:35.700
Jaehun's size

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.540
is similar to mine.

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:46.560
Putting them together like this feels like
we are living together—it's nice.

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:55.330
But...

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.570
Jaehun has friends?

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.960
What kind of person would they be?

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:25.880
Do you have to get married?

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:27.860
Okay.

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:30.530
Okay, got it.

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:33.210
Of course I support you.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.500
I'll call you later.

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:40.400
You're here.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.460
Here.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:52.760
I can do it myself.

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:02.770
Why didn't you bring
your partner today?

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:04.050
Are you abstaining

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:06.290
or becoming a monk?

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:09.740
Will someone who is becoming a monk

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:10.890
come drink with you?

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:21.950
You

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:24.720
look different from before.

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:26.820
How so?

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:32.030
Well, how do I put this?

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.400
You look more alive than before.

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:36.970
People change.

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.370
I didn't expect you
to be saying things like that.

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:46.250
Was I that cold before?

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:47.120
No.

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:50.190
You're just more boring than in the past.

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:56.820
Speaking of,

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:01.050
you were overseas for a long time—
why come back so suddenly?

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:02.580
Would you believe me if I say

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:03.510
it's to see you?

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.130
Aren't you afraid that
I'll poison that alcohol?

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.320
If you wanted to poison me,
you'd have done so long ago.

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:21.930
Why wait till now?

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:23.920
You really know me.

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:28.060
I've been busy.

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:30.180
I don't have time to play with you.

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:31.440
What are you busy with?

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.210
Picking your next partner?

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:39.300
I'm in a relationship.

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:41.690
With that fiancee?

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:43.030
No.

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:46.300
There's someone I like.

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.200
We are seriously dating.

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:52.160
You?

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:52.990
Dating?

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:55.650
My gosh.

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:58.390
I didn't expect you to become like this.

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:02.030
I told you people change.

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:08.470
Here.

00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:10.450
Cheers to your great love.

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:24.170
Love

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:25.630
is really a magical thing.

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:27.930
You look much better than before.

00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:30.090
What kind of person are they?

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:36.600
They're a cute

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:38.590
person.

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:13.200
When is Jaehun coming back?

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:21.880
Haejun!

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.290
Hyung.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.820
Why did you drink so much?

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.050
Are you Haejun?

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:31.940
What are you doing?

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:32.700
I missed you.

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:35.260
Why are you still up?

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:38.810
You missed me?

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:40.490
My baby.

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:43.830
Yes, I didn't sleep.

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:45.600
Why did you drink so much?

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:46.860
Did something happen?

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.530
You're wearing the bell I gave you.

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:56.280
Let me touch it.

00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:58.100
Hyung!

00:27:58.420 --> 00:27:59.380
Are you okay?

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.690
Get up and get changed.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:03.820
Get up.

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:06.470
Why are you so heavy?

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:07.270
Gosh.

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:20.090
I'm exhausted.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:22.570
Let me

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:24.340
get him changed first.

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:29.420
Kim Haejun.

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:33.200
Kiss me, okay?

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:35.880
It's uncomfortable to sleep in this.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.340
Get changed into something clean
and sleep.

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:42.760
Haejun.

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.830
Don't leave me, okay?

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:47.750
Don't leave me.

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:49.380
I won't allow you to leave me!

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:51.950
You can't leave me.

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:54.240
I won't abandon you.

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:56.140
I'm not going anywhere.

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:29.550
Kim Haejun!

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:12.420
No! No!

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:18.050
No!

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:22.790
All right.

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:25.020
No, I have to go.

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:27.310
Haejun is waiting for me.

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:27.990
I have to go.

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:31.070
I'll take you home. Let's go together.

00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:32.150
Not there.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:33.740
Let's go there.

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:45.720
He's changed

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:47.770
a lot more than I expected.

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:09.750
Yes, sir.

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:11.980
Don't worry.

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:15.050
I'll take care of your fiance.

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:18.630
I'll make him cut ties with that guy.

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:20.880
In that case,

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.870
he'll go back to Seoul naturally.

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:25.720
You two

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:27.800
will have a perfect new year.

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.200
Yes.

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:40.510
Kim Haejun, right?

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.800
Seems like my days
won't be boring anymore.
