00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.320
Do you want to shower first?
The bathroom's over there.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:22.950
Did you bring a towel with you?

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.230
Thank you.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.760
Did your parents ask about
you staying over?

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.210
They didn't ask.
I said I'm staying at my partner's.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.370
Mom said hurry up
and make it official already.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.580
That's not true.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.070
Just kidding.
I said I'm staying at your place.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.890
They trust you.
They like you after meeting you.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.440
"From only playing basketball
and ignoring school,

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.930
Akin helped him with his studies."

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.330
That's what having
a good partner means.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.440
My dad didn't say that. I did.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.650
My parents trust you a lot.

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:23.260
I'm trustworthy.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.539
But can you be trusted?

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.660
Hmm, I'm not so sure about that.

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:33.170
Go take a shower.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.710
Don't undress here.
Do it in the bathroom.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.979
Come on.

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.050
I'll undress right here.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.630
We're close, aren't we?

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:11.960
Why didn't you close
the door properly?

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.410
If you want it closed, come do it.
I want to show off.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.840
Basketball muscles are solid.
Want to check?

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.010
No.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.470
- 'Kin.
- Hm?

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.500
Can you grab me a towel?

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.230
Why didn't you bring one in?

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.990
Come on, please get it for me.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.610
Here.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.700
Hey, Than.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.210
Thank you.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.650
People can be so cold-hearted.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.320
Letting a poor kid like me
sleep on the floor.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.980
Or you take the bed
and I sleep on the floor?

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.220
Why don't we just sleep together?

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.070
I'm your partner, you know.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.210
Partner my ass.
Don't talk nonsense.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.860
Ow, the floor is really hard.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.940
Stop whining.
Staying over is already a big step.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.870
We've been together
almost three months.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.040
Together? Don't push it.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.190
See? You're so mean.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.300
No pity for a young student athlete.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.600
You won't let me sleep comfortably.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.570
Next time, just go home.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.280
It's okay. This is fine for now.

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.490
At least it's our first night
sleeping close.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.490
Come on, sleep. You talk too much.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.630
- Good night.
- Good night.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.430
Turn this way.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.950
Why?

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.320
Can I hold your hand?

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.090
Satisfied now?

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.320
You silly kid.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.130
Than.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.550
I gave you my first kiss.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.130
A promise this 10th grader
will love you sincerely.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.350
Can I trust that?

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.480
Or should I do it again?

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.060
Enough. I believe you.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.670
You took my first kiss.
Take responsibility.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.570
Was that really your first kiss?

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.940
You've never kissed anyone?

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:50.030
Really?

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.860
Answer me first.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.570
I'll remember it. August 8th.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.520
Our first kiss together.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:24.960
If I still have a chance,

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.650
I won't let love be a secret again.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.720
Nut said the gym may close soon.

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.040
Who are you going to battle?

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.330
If you're ready, let's go.

00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:37.600
One, two, three.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.260
No matter what we face,

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.320
please don't let go of
my hand again.

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.250
Mawin is my brother's son.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.670
That's enough, Akin.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.540
Stop using Mawin as a stand-in.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.090
- Let's go.
- Wait, Meya.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:52.780
Meya!

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:35.750
Teasing me this early?

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:37.780
I thought you wouldn't wake up.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:39.659
Why wouldn't I?

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:42.780
Because last night...

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:47.340
Don't underestimate me.
I'm still strong.

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:50.700
Were you happy last night?

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.820
Yes, I was.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:09:01.270
So my skills haven't dropped,
after we didn't...

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:04.520
Than.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.520
And you? Were you happy?

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.770
I was very happy.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.770
Worth the long wait.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.490
How did no one come
into your life for years?

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.090
Who said no one did?
There were many.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.640
I wasn't interested.
I waited for you.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.890
- Really?
- Really.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.150
Then what did you do?

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:42.410
What do you mean?

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.270
Well...

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.730
Oh.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.150
- I had some help.
- Help?

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.600
Like friends with benefits?

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:56.740
No.

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:03.930
Than.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.130
I didn't want anyone
to replace you.

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:11.010
I just had to deal with
myself somehow.

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:21.100
Kin.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.060
Hm?

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.240
You're not leaving again, right?

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.720
Can you promise me?

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:31.960
I'm afraid you'll disappear again.

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:34.050
I promise, Than.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.130
I won't walk out of your life again.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.670
No matter what happens,

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:45.500
I'll stay right here.

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:49.460
I'll stay by your side.
I won't go anywhere.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:59.950
Don't disappear, run away,
go silent, or see others.

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:03.090
And don't love anyone but me.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.860
I allow you just one thing.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:06.810
What is it?

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:09.940
I allow you to grow old before me.

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:20.640
When we were kids,
I said I'd grow up fast.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:22.400
So I could ask you
to be my partner.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.960
Now I'm grown and I have you
back as my partner.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.970
If I age past you,
I wouldn't know how.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.270
So you can grow old first.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.070
Even if you're old and wrinkled,

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:43.940
with crow's feet, gray hair,
or bad hearing,

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.560
I'll still love you.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.440
And I'll say I love you every day.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.140
You promise?

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:55.340
I mean it.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.100
I love you.

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:04.720
I love you too.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:21.070
When couples wake up,
what do they do in the morning?

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.820
They shower, wash up,
then go to work.

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.050
So they can build a future together.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:29.690
No.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:35.130
This is what people in love do.

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:37.670
Hey, Than. Than!

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:43.070
Than, that's enough.
I'm going to shower.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.340
Just a moment.

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:46.600
Hey, Than!

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.290
- Just a moment isn't real.
- Fine, stay still then.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:53.520
This trainer will
take care of his trainee.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.440
Hey, Than!

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:57.760
Than!

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.500
Than! Than!

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:35.900
Anything I can help with?

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:38.770
Just sit back.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.670
Let me show my skills.

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:45.280
Two sunny-side-up eggs,
not fully cooked.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.540
Or three,
to make up for lost energy.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:10.390
Thank you.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.850
Our first breakfast together
in five years.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.940
Getting ready to be
a full-time househusband.

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:42.630
Is your condo rented?

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.450
Yes. Did you buy or rent yours?

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:47.640
Bought it.

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:50.940
Paid off yet? I can help pay.

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:54.240
So this can be our place.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:58.110
No need.
Aren't you the househusband?

00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:59.930
Pay it all yourself.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:04.260
Sure. I'll marry in
and be the family head.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.110
You're really over the top.

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:15.350
May I break the yolk?

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:21.020
Sweet-looking basketball kid,

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:23.180
since when did you get so sly?

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:27.190
I should handle this early.

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:28.990
Before it gets worse.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.490
Why is my boyfriend so rough?

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:42.340
Just eat. Be good.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:31.370
Are you full, Mawin?

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:32.780
Yes, I am.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.860
Why are you mad at
Uncle Kin and Uncle Than?

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:44.380
If I ask you to live
with me and study here,

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.110
what would you say?

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:49.830
Whatever you want. I love you.

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:52.800
Uncle Kin says I should listen to you.

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:55.800
No one loves us like parents do.

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:01.940
Do you still want to have a dad?

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:05.550
Uncle Kin is my dad.

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:07.750
When I'm not with you,

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:10.160
I let him be my dad.

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:14.170
I call him Daddy Kin when we go out.

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:15.790
I love him.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:21.180
I mean, do you still
want to see your real dad?

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:39.690
Drop me here.

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.430
- Catch them.
- What?

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.340
Don't think we didn't notice.

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:49.500
Two breakfast plates,
two coffee cups.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:52.580
And a status saying you're taken.

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:53.810
What's going on?

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.040
They came out of
the car together too.

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:58.740
They even kissed
before getting out. I saw it.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.570
Don't laugh. You're a suspect too.

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.060
Suspect of what, AJ?

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:05.930
Indy and I investigated for ages.
You can't escape.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:10.130
Too said there will be
no work or meetings today

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:12.020
until Beyond Perfect knows the truth.

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:12.610
Exactly.

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:15.630
This isn't the time to hide
the truth anymore, Than.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:19.260
It's past hiding
two people's happiness.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.330
It's not shameful to love someone.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.300
We should proudly say

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:28.960
they are the one who makes us happy.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:32.020
Take those two for questioning.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.590
Go. Now.

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:36.640
- What is this?
- What's going on?

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.380
Let me ask directly.

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:43.890
What is your relationship right now?

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.490
- Well, before we...
- We used to be a couple.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.070
And now we're together again.

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:56.050
Oh really, Than?

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:58.740
Can you give details?

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.940
When did you two start dating?

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.730
Oh, AJ.

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:08.310
- Great question since you're here.
- Nice.

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:11.430
Than, answer him.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:16.260
Back in grade 10,
I was playing basketball.

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:20.450
The ball hit him as he walked by.

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:24.450
Oh wow, such a classic plot.

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:27.960
What were you doing at his school?

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:28.550
Well...

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:30.740
I had just passed my university exam.

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:33.170
So I visited my old teachers
with friends.

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:36.850
So you were from the same school.

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:40.210
Yes, but we didn't
know each other then.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:41.810
- Oh?
- And then?

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:45.070
So you fell in love
from a ball to the head?

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:47.180
You're easy, man.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:51.210
No, he fell for me first.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:54.170
Really, Than?

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:58.040
Kin, don't tell me the kid flirted.

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:03.080
Or you couldn't resist
that high school charm?

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:05.820
Something like that.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:13.670
I admit it.
Than was my love at first sight.

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:17.070
I never believed in it before

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.010
until I met him.

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:22.670
Not just because he looks good,

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:26.010
but because he is truly himself.

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:29.740
Honest, pure, sincere.

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:34.080
Than's charm isn't just his looks.

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:39.180
It's in every word and every action.

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:44.440
I feel so lucky to
meet someone like him.

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:49.200
Someone I don't need reasons to love.

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:55.440
If it's not him,
I won't love anyone else.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.640
Sweeter than a sugar substitute ad.

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:02.710
True. Oops.

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:03.700
Hey, what's wrong?

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:07.520
I don't know if I'm cringing
or just jealous.

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:11.760
What do you like about him, Than?

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:12.240
Well...

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:16.180
Back then,
I didn't really know what love was.

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:19.760
I thought he was handsome,
a huggable senior.

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:24.620
Whenever he looked at me,
I wanted to be good for him.

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:28.270
I felt his care and kindness.

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.540
I wanted him to look at me
like that every day.

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:33.790
Before I knew it,

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:37.630
I grew up with those feelings.

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:41.340
It was my first love,
still lasting today.

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.890
Was Than your first love too?

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:55.840
My gosh,
which novel did this come from?

00:21:56.330 --> 00:22:00.730
It's so real some people
might not understand.

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:02.080
This isn't a novel.

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:04.080
It's a dream many people have.

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:07.080
And it came true for Than and Akin.

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:11.010
So how did you get back together?

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:15.790
There was a misunderstanding
in Than's first year.

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.600
I thought he cheated
and got a girl pregnant.

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:21.830
Whoa, that's intense.

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.690
I didn't know about it at all.

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:26.780
So you broke up just like that?

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:29.980
You just believed it?

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:34.920
See, Kin?
Even AJ knows you were way too...

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:36.720
There was more before that.

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:39.180
Than stayed over at a friend's dorm.

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.310
They took a photo lying
on the same bed.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:46.490
There were condoms
and other stuff by the bed.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:48.290
But it wasn't what Kin thought.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.200
Those things were my friend's.

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:52.500
Just normal stuff guys keep around.

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.020
But that wasn't all.

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:57.520
Than also worked at
a female friend's place.

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.980
After that,
there was a mark on his neck.

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:05.570
All the bad coincidences
hit me at once.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.580
An ant bit my neck.

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.600
But it looked like
a hickey from a girl.

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.520
It really looked convincing.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:19.210
That's why couples
need to trust each other.

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:23.880
But many who trusted still got hurt.

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:25.210
- Right, Fai?
- Exactly, Fai.

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:26.680
It all built up.

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.800
Then the pregnancy rumor
happened too.

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:30.770
So all trust was gone.

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.630
I thought Than really did it.

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:35.810
So he left me without a word.

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:39.450
Leaving me in doubt
for four or five years.

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:40.760
But it's okay now.

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:44.090
In the end, we met again
at Nene and Mawin's school.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.540
And here, in this building.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:51.000
So the call to investigate Mawin
and Akin was about this?

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:53.870
I thought Mawin was Than's child.

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.820
So I helped his mom take care of him.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.620
Then who is Mawin's dad?

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.410
Sun. He's my older brother.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.950
- Oh.
- Your brother.

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:07.520
I'll tell you the details
another time.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.060
I want to hear about your first kiss.

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:13.890
You two broke up for years.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.770
- Didn't either of you...
- AJ!

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:20.140
Enough. That's inappropriate.
You can't ask that.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.600
So how was the first kiss?

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:26.640
So to sum it up,

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:30.640
You two are back together
and officially dating, right?

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:33.760
Yes.

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:41.650
Should I ask this?
So, are you getting married?

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:49.850
We still have
a few things to sort out.

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:51.130
Oh, okay.

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.480
What else is there?

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:54.830
Hey, enough.

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:08.960
What are you doing?

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.210
I've seen you focused
on that notebook.

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:16.390
Can you help me fill in
my family tree?

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:20.320
Uncle Kin isn't my real dad.

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:23.320
Should I write that I have no father?

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.720
Or can I still write his name?

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.240
My grandparents are in heaven.

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.370
So I'll write they're in heaven too.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.430
Do I have grandparents on dad's side?

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:54.560
My friends fill many boxes.

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:57.440
But having just you is enough for me.

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.520
I'll write your name really big.

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.250
Filling the whole page
like everyone else.

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:29.490
Oh, you're leaving, Than?

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:31.420
Yes. Is there anything?

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:36.950
It's nothing. We'll talk later.

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.690
After you're done with love stuff.

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:41.620
I need help deciding something.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.710
You decide. No need to wait for me.

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:46.610
I'll go with your call. I'm off.

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:55.860
Once you're free from romance,

00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:59.080
come help carry this failure, Than.

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:13.430
Hello, Uncle Than, Uncle Kin.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.730
Oh, Nut. Closing alone again?

00:27:58.510 --> 00:27:59.160
Yes.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.690
Has it not improved at all?

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:06.670
Just as you can see.

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:10.710
So what do we do next?

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:22.280
We may have to close this branch.

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:25.900
And refocus on the first branch
that's still doing well.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.270
Than doesn't know
we have to close this place yet.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.550
He's deep in love these days.

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:40.650
When we hit a dead end,

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:44.630
sometimes we have to
take another path

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:46.980
that lets us keep going.

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:51.360
A dead end.

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:56.930
I forgot about that.

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.660
I only thought that
if I tried hard enough,

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:04.930
one day,

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:09.720
I'd find a way to reach him.

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:16.390
Even though there were
signs all along

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.870
that no matter how I walked,

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:27.630
I'd end up at a dead end anyway.

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.280
I think I understand you.

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:44.950
The reason I opened this branch

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:51.130
was so Than could fully take charge.

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:56.190
I planned to support him
from a distance.

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:02.990
I wanted him to have
a place to stand.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:07.160
But he stood with
someone else, not you.

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:12.810
It's okay.

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.680
Just being able to
care for him is enough.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:22.340
You wanted him to see
what you did for him, but he didn't.

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:26.400
I think he did see it.

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.970
He saw that I'm only fit
to be a big brother.

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:42.780
Not everyone we love
has to love us back.

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:48.660
Not everything we do with
our whole heart has to be ours.

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:03.690
That's just how it is.

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:08.150
So when do you have to move out?

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:12.170
Probably within this month.

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:56.450
Hello, Uncle.

00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:57.510
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:31:57.530 --> 00:32:00.610
Oh, I wondered who it was.
Why didn't you tell us first?

00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:02.650
Oh, did Mawin come too?

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:03.700
Mawin.

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:07.370
Someone wants to meet you.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:13.130
Oh, who's that? She's very pretty.

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:21.390
This is Meya, Mawin's mother.

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.070
Hello.

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:42.090
I didn't know that...

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:47.710
Sun left us before
Nene was even born.

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:53.770
I know I shouldn't even
be sitting here.

00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:57.110
I'm not fit to be involved
with anyone.

00:32:57.830 --> 00:33:01.520
What happened between Sun and me
was just youthful emotions.

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:07.450
I may not have started
the way everyone hoped

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:11.150
but your child is my grandchild.

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:16.140
Life isn't always neat and orderly.

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:19.370
Sometimes it starts unintentionally.

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:23.260
But in the end, it might turn into
the best gift of all.

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:25.920
Like Mawin.

00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:30.180
Come here, come to Grandpa.
Let me give you a big hug.

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:33.880
Oh my, wow.
It's like I got tackled.

00:33:38.770 --> 00:33:44.060
Nene, are you happy?
Mawin is your little brother now.

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:46.770
What little brother?
He’s bigger than me!

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:51.970
Mawin is Daddy Sun’s child too.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:55.070
Then you aren't Mawin’s dad?

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:03.980
This is so confusing.
Suddenly Mawin is my brother.

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:09.199
Then that means you have to share
your snacks with me all the time?

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:13.040
Oolder siblings have to take care of
and sacrifice for their younger ones.

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:16.190
- That sounds like forcing her.
- Totally forcing her.

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:17.179
Alright.

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:19.290
- Alright, Nene.
- Come to Grandma.

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:24.980
My legs are completely numb.

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:31.060
Children really are the best bond
for every family.

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:40.280
Give your brother lots of snacks.

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:43.940
Take good care of him, understand?

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:47.719
Please come in.

00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:57.510
It feels like everything
is finally settling down.

00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:02.250
Even though I once thought
this day would never come.

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:16.640
Bougainvillea grows well
in harsh, dry conditions.

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:21.180
It withstands sun and rain,
even when the soil isn’t good.

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:24.480
Yet it can still bloom beautifully.

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:29.190
It’s a symbol of strength, patience,

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:32.240
and beauty born from not giving up.

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.430
It’s not easy for it to bloom.

00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:39.730
But once it does,
it can bloom all year round.

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.360
It’s kind of like our love.

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:53.310
We went through so many things
to finally reach today.

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:58.520
Do you think we’re grown enough now?

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:06.790
We really owe it to our patience.

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:12.290
In the end, it turned out beautiful,
just like this bougainvillea.

00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:18.210
- Kin.
- Hmm?

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:20.150
Stay here tonight.

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:22.760
Stay? I didn’t bring anything.

00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:26.000
You don’t need to.
Everything’s already here.

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:28.720
You can wear my clothes.

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:33.870
Please… stay here tonight.

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:35.820
Tomorrow’s a day off anyway.

00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:39.290
Please?

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.450
- You know what this is?
- I know.

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.500
- Betel leaves?
- Betel leaves.

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:21.520
- Than, give me a fish.
- Can you eat it?

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:23.090
- One whole fish, Dad?
- Yeah, one whole fish.

00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:24.400
It’s Mawin’s favorite.

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:26.860
- Careful.
- A big bowl.

00:37:26.890 --> 00:37:30.160
Here you go. Eat a lot
so you’ll grow as big as Mawin.

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:03.380
Have you tried it yet?

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.850
If you scoop it and it splashes...

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:07.160
Mawin, say goodbye to everyone.

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.210
Bye, Grandpa and Grandma.

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:13.090
Bye, Uncle Kin and Uncle Than.

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:14.210
Bye...

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:19.150
You are younger,
so you should tell me too.

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:22.430
Bye, Nene.

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:26.790
Good boy, little brother.
Grow up fast.

00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:31.520
- Wow.
- Hey, you grow up fast too.

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:34.420
Look at your brother,
he’s so much bigger than you.

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:36.170
Yeah, shorty.

00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:41.760
Pack your clothes and
stay here next week, Mawin.

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:45.200
How about staying with
Grandpa and Grandma for a week?

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:46.030
Okay.

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:50.880
I’ll prepare a room and lots of toys.

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:52.740
So we can play all day.

00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:56.330
Alright, let’s go.

00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:59.100
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:00.260
Have a safe trip.

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:10.090
- I have something to show you.
- What is it?

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:11.950
What are you two whispering about?

00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:13.940
Tell me too.

00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:15.570
They're leaving.

00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:17.860
Dad.

00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:19.280
Yes?

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:25.010
How steady must one be
to take care of someone?

00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:35.690
Than, don’t you have
any other clothes?

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:45.530
Enough.

00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:49.050
Do you usually sleep
dressed like this?

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:52.610
No, I got it ready for you.

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:55.830
Just wear it.
You’ll take it off anyway.

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:58.570
Take off what?
You bought it, you wear it.

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:01.770
Then want to swap?

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:03.790
I can wear yours.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:04.830
It’s fine.

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:10.180
Hey, what are you doing?

00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:12.160
We’re swapping, right?

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.640
If you won’t take it off,
I’ll help you.

00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:21.020
Your parents will wake up.

00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:23.850
Then don’t be loud.

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.060
Than.

00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:29.960
Don’t be loud, and don’t resist.

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:00.870
Than.

00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:02.650
Yes?

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.880
Did you lock the front door?

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:06.660
I did, Dad.

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:07.610
Good.

00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:16.360
That’s enough.

00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:33.890
- Never been here, right?
- I think so.

00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:36.140
- Feels like an old beach.
- How do people live here?

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:37.700
- Hmm.
- Where did Nene go?

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:40.300
She’s probably drawing in that room.

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:42.650
What about Akin?

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:46.420
He’s still asleep. He looked
comfortable, so I didn’t wake him.

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:47.460
Oh.

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:52.900
Huh? these don’t look alike at all.

00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:58.230
Dad, Mom.

00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:02.750
You wake up to each other
every day for 30 years.

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:04.250
Don’t you ever get bored?

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:07.560
Oh my, why ask that?

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:09.130
Yeah.

00:43:11.830 --> 00:43:13.090
I just want to know.

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:15.830
Hmm...

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:18.990
- Sometimes I do.
- What?

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:24.410
But if I had no him and had to
get bored with someone else,

00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:26.160
I’d rather not.

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:31.040
Saying I’m never bored
wouldn’t be true.

00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:36.610
But even when I am,
I still want to see him every day.

00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:39.900
This is the first time
I’ve heard this.

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:40.940
Really?

00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:45.600
Enduring love, you see,

00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:48.310
isn’t about never getting bored.

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:51.300
It’s about choosing to stay together.

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:56.820
Even if you wake up
to a day with nothing exciting at all,

00:43:56.850 --> 00:44:00.000
you still want to wake up
and see the same familiar face.

00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:04.170
Don’t act all cute.

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:07.260
I just found out you used to
get bored of me.

00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:10.190
That’s life.

00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:12.070
Let’s keep looking at this.

00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:14.580
I want to be like you.

00:44:15.250 --> 00:44:17.470
I want to wake up
and see Kin every day.

00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:21.650
But I’m not sure how well
I can take care of him.

00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:27.930
You can.

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:36.860
I’m off.

00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:41.600
What now?

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:46.940
I’m off.

00:44:56.260 --> 00:45:00.900
The brand aims to lead
Asia’s full-service EV industry.

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:04.120
Their product is electric golf carts.

00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:07.290
They’re the first to
contact us directly.

00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:09.670
- Yes.
- Great, great.

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:16.270
- Been waiting long?
- Not at all.

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:17.640
You must be tired today.

00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:19.530
So much. Meetings all day.

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:21.460
- Let me help.
- Thanks.

00:45:21.490 --> 00:45:22.290
The bag too.

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.480
It’s okay. Let’s eat. I’m starving.

00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:25.150
Let’s go.

00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:57.620
- Hello, bro.
- Yeah.

00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:29.020
What are you reading?

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:32.760
I’m reviewing client info
for tomorrow’s pitch.

00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:34.790
Dry my hair for me.

00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:37.760
Why don’t you do it yourself?

00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:40.270
Who usually dries it for you?

00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:42.980
Well, I have you now.

00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:45.330
I can do it myself,

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:49.480
but having my boyfriend do it
feels like a life mission.

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:53.190
People with partners want to
be taken care of.

00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:57.170
They want affection,
to stick together all the time.

00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:11.940
You’re not going back to your room?

00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:16.750
When my lease ends,
I’ll move in with you.

00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:20.560
Nene can stay too.
We’ll all be together.

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:25.080
Morning and evening,
we can take turns picking them up.

00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:27.710
I’ve planned everything already.

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:50.420
Let me flick this clingy head once.

00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:54.370
All done. Go get changed
and get some sleep.

00:47:57.940 --> 00:47:59.100
Who said I’m sleeping?

00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:04.200
Hurry, put your clothes on.

00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:06.840
Why? I’ll just take them off again.

00:48:08.970 --> 00:48:10.020
Not tonight.

00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:11.680
Why not?

00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:13.730
Recovery.

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:15.230
Recovery from what?

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:17.580
Well, Than...

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:21.950
Okay then, tonight,

00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:28.480
I’ll play a clueless high schooler
who knows nothing in bed.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.380
Should a college senior teach him?

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:37.930
Hey, don’t you ever get tired?

00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:39.640
No, I don't.

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:40.850
Please?

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:43.950
I’ll be as gentle as possible.

00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:47.090
Can I trust that?

00:48:58.290 --> 00:48:59.560
Is this gentle enough?

00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:21.490
my heart is yours, the only one.

00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:24.470
It’s always been, it’ll always stay,

00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:29.880
I’d never turn my love away.

00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:34.510
And meeting you again today,

00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:39.110
I realize, though years have flown,

00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:45.820
My heart’s still yours,
you’re still my own.

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:51.060
It’s been so long since last we met,

00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:54.920
yet you’re the same I can’t forget.

00:49:56.440 --> 00:50:03.250
Just like the days we used to share,
those memories linger everywhere.

00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:07.400
Tell me, love, are you doing fine,

00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:11.490
When I no longer walk beside your line?

00:50:12.290 --> 00:50:15.580
I hope you miss me after all,

00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:23.100
the way my heart
still hears your call.

00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:29.410
I hope you miss me after all,

00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:45.420
the way my heart
still hears your call.

00:51:13.710 --> 00:51:16.580
Wake up, sweetheart.
You’ll be late for work.

00:51:17.490 --> 00:51:19.180
A bit longer?

00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:21.790
What longer?

00:51:22.690 --> 00:51:26.330
Than, can I sleep a little more?

00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:34.420
Can you even work like this?

00:51:39.210 --> 00:51:42.480
I said recovery,
but you wouldn’t listen.

00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:46.380
Did you like it though?

00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:52.790
Come on.

00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:55.330
Get up now, sweetheart.

00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:58.310
I’ll get dressed and make breakfast.

00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:09.310
Come on, get up.

00:52:10.450 --> 00:52:12.000
If not, I’ll go for round two.

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:14.670
Go on. Can you handle it?

00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:21.290
Are you challenging the system?

00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:25.350
I just want to see if you can.

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:30.210
Just kidding. Go shower.

00:53:11.490 --> 00:53:13.110
I thought I came early.

00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:15.760
Why are you always here first?

00:53:17.830 --> 00:53:21.880
Try being more serious.
Maybe you’ll come earlier.

00:53:24.130 --> 00:53:26.440
Why so serious this morning?

00:53:29.310 --> 00:53:32.560
We have to move out by month’s end.

00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:40.680
Some equipment will be
sold secondhand.

00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:45.920
The newer machines will go
to the first branch.

00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:48.700
And replace the old ones there.

00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:55.670
Why so fast? This month?

00:53:57.140 --> 00:54:00.090
It’s not fast.
I’ve stalled for months.

00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:05.180
Sorry. I really can’t hold on anymore.

00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:10.000
I think it’s still possible.

00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:14.440
Small losses could be covered
by the other branch.

00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:17.010
We’ve covered it for months.

00:54:18.970 --> 00:54:20.110
But it won’t survive.

00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:26.510
The location’s good,
but locals’ lifestyles differ.

00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:28.410
Not what we expected.

00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:42.070
Shouldn’t we fight a bit more?

00:54:43.350 --> 00:54:45.210
We already have regulars.

00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:49.300
If we tweak the plan,
it could still work.

00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:53.040
I’m afraid it’ll be wasted effort.

00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:56.040
And you don’t have time
for this place.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.460
Better put our full effort into
the first branch.

00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:05.920
Then find a new spot
if we want to try again.

00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:11.650
Are you saying I didn’t try
hard enough here?

00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:13.980
And with Akin?

00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:18.130
How much do you give him?

00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:22.500
Think of him from
waking till sleeping.

00:55:23.330 --> 00:55:25.670
Even dream of him.

00:55:27.330 --> 00:55:30.480
Do things for him
without being asked.

00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:34.570
And here, this fitness center...

00:55:36.350 --> 00:55:38.680
Have you ever loved it like that?

00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:48.100
I’m not blaming you.

00:55:50.330 --> 00:55:55.020
People have different
focuses at each life stage.

00:55:56.350 --> 00:56:00.330
You may want stability
in love and your heart.

00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:02.250
That’s not strange.

00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:07.190
It’s normal not to
focus here as much.

00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:12.280
So what are you focused on now?

00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:19.980
Part of it is life stability.

00:56:22.170 --> 00:56:24.250
And the other thing
I’ve never stopped focusing on

00:56:25.770 --> 00:56:26.490
is you.

00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:30.000
I kept trying to
make this gym succeed

00:56:31.290 --> 00:56:33.150
because I wanted you
to be proud of himself,

00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:35.670
to feel secure in life.

00:56:36.730 --> 00:56:38.220
And honestly, without shame...

00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:44.510
deep down, I also wanted you
to see that I’m the one

00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:48.790
who helped make
your life better bit by bit.

00:56:49.110 --> 00:56:51.910
I’ve always seen it.
It’s not that I didn’t.

00:56:53.210 --> 00:56:55.050
– But I...
– Yeah, yeah.

00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:58.520
Hey, forget it.

00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:02.970
No one gets everything
they want in life.

00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:06.520
There has to be disappointment.

00:57:08.970 --> 00:57:10.130
Business is the same.

00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:19.310
But you’ve never made me feel
like I lost anything

00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:22.920
from loving you

00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:28.470
even if it’s only as your brother.

00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:35.940
Just being able to love is
already worth it.

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:48.350
I’m sorry that I can only
give you this much.

00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:54.010
And thank you for always
taking care of me

00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:56.240
in every way.

00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:00.510
And I’m still willing to
help you going forward.

00:58:08.050 --> 00:58:11.970
Don’t overthink it.
We still have another branch.

00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:16.800
And we still have to give it
our all to make it better.

00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:22.060
Come on, let’s push forward
with the first branch.

00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:26.250
And wait for the chance
to open a new one later.

00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:29.170
Alright.

00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:31.940
Our product is a luxury vehicle

00:58:32.210 --> 00:58:34.270
but we want to present it
in a contrasting way

00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:36.950
by switching the background
to a more minimalist style.

00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:40.240
These are all ideas proposed
by Beyond Perfect.

00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:42.220
– Sounds good.
– Yeah.

00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:44.060
– It’ll work, bro.
– Yeah.

00:58:47.740 --> 00:58:50.910
I’m not sure minimalism
is still trending.

00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:54.340
I want something more vibrant,

00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:57.680
bold colors, big fonts,
instantly memorable.

00:58:58.090 --> 00:59:00.900
And the model, I want someone sexy.

00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:04.190
A strong figure,
something eye-catching.

00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:07.370
As for clothes,
load them with brand names.

00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:10.350
Show that our car is luxurious.

00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:11.670
Okay.

00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:16.130
And one more thing,
I checked the budget handled before.

00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:17.790
I think it was way over the top.

00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:21.930
I’m going to cut the budget in half.

00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:34.370
The previous person you mentioned,
you mean Mr. Don?

00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:39.850
Yes, my experience may not match his

00:59:40.250 --> 00:59:43.830
but I’ve handled quite
a few major projects too.

00:59:44.550 --> 00:59:48.700
Beyond Perfect may need to adjust
our working direction together.

00:59:52.830 --> 00:59:56.610
If you have time, look at
the projects Mr. Don handled.

00:59:57.920 --> 00:59:58.930
Then you’ll understand

00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:02.600
why people in the industry
regret his departure so much.

01:00:05.530 --> 01:00:06.540
That impressive?

01:00:07.410 --> 01:00:11.620
Alright then, if I have time,

01:00:12.370 --> 01:00:14.670
I’ll study his past work.

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:20.170
But for this project,
please revise it for me

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:23.070
because I’m the one still here

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.130
and managing this project.

01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:27.290
Yes.

01:00:27.810 --> 01:00:30.430
Mind, set a meeting within this week.

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:35.630
And list other interesting
production houses for me.

01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:41.170
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:00:42.090 --> 01:00:43.890
- See you, Mind.
- Bye.

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:50.370
Ugh.

01:00:51.450 --> 01:00:53.980
Seeing this client
makes me miss Mr. Don.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:54.490
Yeah.

01:00:54.510 --> 01:00:57.920
That guy was perfect.
Super talented.

01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:00.630
He could silence
the whole meeting room

01:01:00.830 --> 01:01:02.210
because everyone wanted to listen.

01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:04.690
This guy can too

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:06.690
but from awkwardness.

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:09.150
True.

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:12.850
Ugh, he rejected
everything we proposed.

01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:15.130
Yes, Mom.

01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:18.380
- One moment, please.
- Sure, Akin.

01:01:20.670 --> 01:01:23.550
- Did you write that down?
- I did.

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.230
Everything needs fixing.

01:01:29.410 --> 01:01:31.750
What did the doctor say, Mom?

01:01:36.510 --> 01:01:39.470
If it takes that long,
what about work here?

01:01:41.570 --> 01:01:44.120
Okay, I’ll arrange things quickly.

01:01:44.250 --> 01:01:45.780
I’ll go as soon as I can.

01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:49.520
Please tell Dad
I’ll come see him soon.

01:01:50.690 --> 01:01:51.700
I love you both.

01:02:17.830 --> 01:02:18.540
- Than.
- Kin.

01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:21.210
You go first.

01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:23.090
No, you first.

01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:25.280
You go. What is it?

01:02:27.830 --> 01:02:31.520
The second gym branch
might have to close.

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:34.310
Probably by the end of this month.

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:38.060
I thought it was still manageable.

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:41.130
I thought so too.

01:02:41.610 --> 01:02:45.580
But after seeing the numbers,
it won’t work.

01:02:46.650 --> 01:02:49.200
We’ll focus on branch one first.

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:51.350
Then think about expanding again.

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:54.490
Is there anything
you want my help with?

01:02:55.650 --> 01:02:56.840
No need to.

01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:00.650
Don’t worry.
The first branch is doing fine.

01:03:01.210 --> 01:03:02.610
I can still cover
your condo payments.

01:03:04.090 --> 01:03:07.380
It’s okay, Than.
I was just joking about that.

01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:16.130
I’m afraid you won’t trust me
to take care of you.

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.800
I want stability in life
as soon as possible.

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:26.710
I never wanted you
to take care of me.

01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:29.930
I just want you in my life.

01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:44.920
But if there’s something
that makes you wait,
