00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.380
(Wuyue tribe · Spring, Year 6 of Yuanqi)

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.350
Zhaoli, we've shared a bed.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.920
What should you call me then?

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.590
Honey.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.150
(I'm about to see his face.)

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.790
(Don't wake up.)

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.150
(In the dream,
I seem to like him very much.)

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.020
(Wu Zhaoli, a healer)
(I called him honey.)

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.480
(I've had this dream so many times.)

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.070
(Yet his face is always hidden.)

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.640
(Who is he, really?)

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.900
If I could obtain

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.790
the Fengwu Bracelet
that reveals the past,

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.120
I could learn who he is.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.120
Wu Zhaoli.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.950
The Grand Princess has sent
for medicine.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:30.790
I'm coming.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.000
Dry this separately.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.940
Alright.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:38.790
Mind the heat.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.310
- Relax.
- This looks about right.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.320
Alright.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.710
What are you waiting for?

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.540
Milord, this is the medicine
for the Grand Princess.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.480
Please take a look.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.870
I have prepared all of it.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.750
This was secretly crafted

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.280
at the Grand Princess's request.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.500
(Li Hucong, attendant
of the Grand Princess)

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.120
As per our agreement,

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.630
when may I borrow

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.360
the Fengwu Bracelet for a while?

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.040
The Grand Princess has said it.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.800
You may borrow the Bracelet.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.310
But you must fetch it yourself.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.800
What are you doing?

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.550
- Let go!
- What are you doing?

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.190
That's not what you said before.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.030
Let go of Zhaoli!

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.493
Grandmother! Grandmother!

00:02:26.504 --> 00:02:28.510
(Zhaoli's grandmother)
Zhaoli! What are you doing?

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.830
- Don't move!
- Don't hurt her!

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.650
I'll go with you.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.900
- Zhaoli!
- I'll go with you.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.120
- Zhaoli!
- Grandmother!

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.440
- What's going on?
- Grandmother!

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.440
Where are you taking her?

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.830
Did Zhaoli anger the Grand Princess?

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:37.830
- Zhaoli!
- Grandmother!

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.800
Grandmother, I'm fine.
Don't worry about me.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.470
- Zhaoli!
- I'll be back soon.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.310
Release her!

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.150
- Grandmother, I'll be back soon.
- Zhaoli!

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.520
You...

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.800
Let me go!

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.840
Why have you brought me here?

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.460
The Princess has given the order.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.910
The Bracelet is a rare treasure.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.630
If you wish to borrow it,

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.360
it depends on whether you can consummate
the union tonight.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.870
Consummate the union?

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.870
The Grand Princess

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.420
is forcing someone into consummation?

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.710
How utterly absurd.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:17.710
Let go!

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.920
Let go of me!

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.840
You have only four hours.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.680
Don't go!

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.470
Could it be that the Grand Princess

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.030
is unable to bear children

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.400
and wants me to consummate
with her toy boy?

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.360
Absolutely not!

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.900
He's clearly
under the influence of a drug.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.800
I must get out.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:14.750
Open the door!

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.560
Help!

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.480
Let me out of here!

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.680
Open the door.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:22.590
So noisy.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.190
Milord, please spare my life.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.360
I've been poisoned.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.190
Please, don't hurt me.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.680
Once I get out of here,

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.950
I'll surely repay your kindness.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.870
Did Ye Li send you?

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.630
You're the one from my dreams?

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:47.680
I'm not.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.680
Is it you?

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.190
Let me take a look at you.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.360
If you dare defy the order,

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.530
don't blame the Grand Princess
for flaying you alive.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.140
(Everlasting Joy)

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.030
Your Highness.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.100
Each time the Frostbite Curse flares up,

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.850
the ruler would rather endure the pain

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.680
than touch the women you sent in.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.170
This time, I fear it will be the same.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.170
This time, it's different.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:25.560
(Ye Li, Grand Princess)

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.040
That healer has a rare constitution.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.630
With the love potion,

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.920
she can surely ease his Frostbite Curse.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.430
Watch closely.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.750
You are not him.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.040
Not him.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.430
Let go of me.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.120
You shameless rogue!

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.750
If you don't wish to suffer,

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:54.430
then stay still.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.190
What are you trying to do?

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.320
Helping you finish your task.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.860
(Everlasting Joy)

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.680
You... you bit me!

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.160
You can detoxify the love poison?

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.120
How did you manage that?

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.040
Put away your curiosity.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.800
Leave at once.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.240
I'm not one to owe favors to anyone.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.630
Since you saved my life,

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.430
I'll return the favor.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.390
Then we'll be even.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.080
What is this?

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.920
A feign-death pill.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.830
My secret prescription.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:13.390
Judging by your looks,

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.750
you must be
the Grand Princess's toy boy.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:17.760
Her toy boy?

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.950
Rather than stay under her twisted hand,

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:21.070
enduring torment,

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:25.000
why not live freely on your own?

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.140
Once you leave the Palace,

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.750
find an honest way to make a living.

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:34.600
Guards, come!

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.070
The toy boy is dead!

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:37.920
Take me to the Grand Princess at once!

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:54.480
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.360
As you ordered,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.800
I had the consummation with that man.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.040
Please honor your promise

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.510
by lending the Bracelet

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.160
to me.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:07.750
I let you consummate with him

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.680
to ease his suffering.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.120
But you ended up

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.000
making him faint.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:14.030
Guards!

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.920
Take her life in punishment.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.160
Wait! Wait!

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.560
Your Highness,

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.070
you're clearly the ones at fault.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.040
I did exactly as you asked.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.870
Why am I the one to be executed?

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:29.920
Besides,

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.160
as the Grand Princess,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.030
how could you...

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.660
(Ying Du, ruler of Puluo State)

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.360
(Why the sudden whip marks?)

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:51.960
(Why is my power)

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.510
(unable to heal even a wound?)

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:09.840
(She shares a spiritual link with me.)

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:16.120
(So foolish)

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.320
(to have someone pull your hair.)

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.030
How could you

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:27.080
lash me just like this?

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.200
Your status doesn't give you
the right to trample lives!

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.600
Sharp-tongued.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.550
Since you are of no use,

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.960
you may go to hell.
