WEBVTT

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:35.451


00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.850
Yes?

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.590
Where are you?

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.200
In my friend's room.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.520
It's late, why aren't you back
in your room?

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.680
I already told you I was working
on a project in my friend's room.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.850
But you didn't mention
staying over.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.970
It got late,
so I decided to stay here.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.890
Is there something wrong?

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.340
Are there a lot of people there?

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.700
There are about 3 or 4 of us.

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.740
Why?

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.900
Send me your location,
I'll pick you up.

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.180
It's really late,
and I'm super tired.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.180
You can stay here, don't worry.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.780
The project is done,
come back to your room.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.440
Okay, up to you.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.180
I'll wait for your call
when you arrive.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.980
What's up?
Is your boyfriend calling you?

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.430
Yeah.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.910
This is Nut, the owner of
the fitness center in our building.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.360
Are you going to
follow me everywhere?

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.780
Who said I'm following you?

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.570
First love is hard to forget.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.450
How do you know that?

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.620
Just a feeling.

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.490
Nice to meet you,
our valued customer.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.070
Don, my name is Donlaphat.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:54.160
Are you single?

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:57.650
Continue?

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.850
Hey.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.340
I miss you so much.
I don’t want to let you go.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.300
Morning, my love.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.089
Good morning.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.410
Give me a kiss.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.620
Huh?

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.730
It’s a morning kiss.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.860
Wash your face
and brush your teeth first?

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.159
No, I want a kiss first.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.440
You’re so naughty.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.350
Here’s a bonus.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.890
If you're awake,
please leave the room.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.520
I hope this doesn’t happen again.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.550
There are security cameras.
Don’t do anything stupid.

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:41.120
Oh, you’re watching? Naughty.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.180
How about two hundred thousand?

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.110
Take this lump of cash.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.820
Can you move it?

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:06.940
What time is it?

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:12.240
You can check.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.620
Hey, it’s late.
We have a 10 a.m. meeting.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.510
It's Saturday. What meeting?

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.420
Wake up, we’re late.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:27.500
Let's sleep a bit more,
it's too late now.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:29.650
No.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.039
Mind, inform
the Beyond Perfect team.

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:41.500
I’m rescheduling
the meeting to 1 p.m.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.520
No more questions.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.620
Yes, Mind.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.320
You’re moving
the meeting to 1 p.m.?

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:28.520
Oh, okay. I’ll let the team know.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.350
Okay, thank you.

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:37.080
Don's secretary called and said
the meeting is moved to 1 p.m.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.070
Mr. Don rescheduled?
How is that possible?

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:42.680
He set the meeting himself.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:43.550
Exactly.

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:47.780
Someone as punctual as him
is always on time.

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:50.820
Must be some emergency.

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:55.830
I woke up early for nothing.

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.510
Hungover too.

00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:59.550
- If I had known...
- AJ.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:00.950
No complaints.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.650
We don’t gossip about clients,
even behind their back.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.990
Alright, let's break for now.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.420
We'll regroup at 12:30.

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:10.930
I brought noodles, let’s eat.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.280
- Sounds good, thanks!
- Thanks!

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:13.660
Eat something hot.

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.150
I’ll take a nap first.

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.960
- Not approved.
- Oh, fine, I’ll just work.

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.750
How is it possible for him
to reschedule?

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.200
When is the meeting moved to,
our valued client?

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:10.850
1 p.m. sharp.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:15.570
It's only just past 10 a.m.
So we don’t need to rush now.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:17.440
Do you have a toothbrush?

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:26.770
There’s a spare toothbrush.

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:30.150
Looks like someone
stays over often.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.030
Were you okay last night?

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:36.560
What do you mean?

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:40.510
I mean...

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.700
If you're taking a shower,
the towels there are clean.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.120
All of them.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:56.730
Are you going there together
or separately?

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:02.170
Let’s go together, save energy,
reduce global warming.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.070
Hurry up, then.

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:06.610
We should leave here by noon.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.020
Got it, boss.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:14.370
Are you showering now?

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.820
No, you go first.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.470
Can I use this bathtub?

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:25.590
Feel free.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.070
How do I turn on the water?
Can you show me?

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.930
Left is hot, right is cold.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.700
Can you show me?
I can’t turn it on.

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:49.740
What are you shy?
You saw it last night.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:06.500
What about that bubbly thing?
Do you have any?

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.850
Bath bomb, it's in the drawer.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.480
Where? I don’t see any.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.100
Let’s shower together.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:23.090
No, I prefer showering alone.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:25.620
Scared?

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:28.970
Scared of what?

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:33.870
We still have time.

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:40.090
You weren’t acting
like this last night.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:41.540
Don’t start.

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:44.820
Let’s shower together.

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:14.430
Do people stay over often?

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:17.560
You're the first.

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:23.150
Should I believe that?

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.600
Up to you.

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:31.810
Aren’t you lonely?

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:35.720
Not really.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:39.780
Don’t you have a boyfriend?

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:43.320
I don’t like commitment.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:48.740
You just go with the flow?

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:50.960
No commitment?

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:53.040
Something like that.

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:08.310
What does this mean?

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.410
Don't give up.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:19.520
That's a nice meaning.

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:24.970
We still have time, right?

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.130
Can you handle one more?

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.440
Don’t talk too much,
we’re wasting time.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.850
It’s a holiday, but why are there
so few people here?

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.510
Maybe the lifestyle around here is
different from the other branch.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:51.440
A mosquito.

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:55.560
Look, it's so quiet
we’re swatting mosquitoes.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.950
Here’s another mosquito.

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:03.010
- Another one here.
- Oh my.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:04.760
- Another mosquito.
- Oh.

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:07.730
Hey, there’s another one.
So many mosquitoes.

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:09.890
Is there a mosquito in your shirt?

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:12.510
- Let me see.
- No mosquitoes in my shirt.

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:15.370
- There’s a big one.
- It's not a mosquito.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.100
- Hurry, let me see.
- No, not in my shirt.

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.080
Hello.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:24.320
All set.

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:26.050
You’re so cute.

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:30.150
We’re brothers.

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:34.920
Really, we are brothers.

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:37.570
Yes, I confirm.

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:42.000
But if you don’t believe me,
I can kiss his cheek to prove it.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:42.790
Come on.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:45.260
- No, don't do it.
- Just a quick kiss.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:48.040
- No.
- She won't believe us.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.410
- No.
- Nut.

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.230
Please come to the cardio zone.

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:52.330
Okay.

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.700
I’ll be back, brother.

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:01.860
Oh, Nut.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.290
Have you arrived?

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:18.560
Will you be here first?

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:22.220
Okay, please wait.
I’ll go pick up Nene.

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:34.260
You can go up first, I’ll follow.

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.220
Why? Are you afraid
people will get suspicious?

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:40.110
No.

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:44.220
Then let’s go together.
Save energy, save the planet!

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:08.030
Be careful with it,
you’re ruining the brand.

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:12.180
- I'm sorry.
- Sure.

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:13.920
- It might take a bit, though.
- That’s fine.

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:18.180
- Are you here for me?
- No.

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:25.350
You have a company today?

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.200
That’s true.

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:35.200
Usually, Beyond Perfect never misses
when it comes to customer privacy.

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:39.520
It’s strange, no one checked
the lift for me twice.

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.670
I think we should head to
the meeting room now.

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:43.970
Okay.

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:48.630
Oops, okay, let’s go.

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:53.870
- Hi, Pond.
- Hi, how are you?

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:55.310
Hello, hello!

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:00.400
Did you change your style today?

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:02.980
Why?

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:06.580
It looks a bit different, like...

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:10.070
Yeah, but this looks cool.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.580
This shirt looks familiar.

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:16.320
I think I’ve seen
someone wear it before.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:20.630
It’s not a limited edition shirt.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.620
Anyone with money can wear it.

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.110
- Please sit, Mr. Don.
- Please.

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:31.400
I apologize for the sudden
reschedule of the meeting.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.000
I had an urgent matter.

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:37.410
Pond.

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.260
Yes, sorry about that.

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:43.500
Shall we start now?

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:46.730
- Sure, let’s go, Akin.
- Okay.

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:48.320
Here you go, Mr. Don.

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.550
Here are the models,
please take a look.

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.510
- We’ve already filtered these?
- Yes.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.710
They’ve all got experience,
easy to work with.

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.260
What do you think? Are they okay?

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.310
I’m fine with the idea
you’ve presented.

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:06.310
But models...

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:12.570
The kids you’ve presented
all have similar faces.

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:15.730
This one has worked in milk ads.

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:18.180
This one did baby soap ads.

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:20.980
This one worked in condo ads.

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:24.220
This one, my team has worked with
on many brands already.

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:28.120
But she's not charming,
she looks too old for her age.

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:34.700
Can you find any fresh faces,
not overused, for this shoot?

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:35.730
Yes, of course.

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:38.810
It’s always the same kids in ads.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.680
But these kids are easy
to work with.

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:43.250
They know the job,
and their parents are easygoing.

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.390
I’ve checked all these kids.

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:48.330
None of them have worked
with ice cream before.

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:50.710
Did I not make myself clear?

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:53.250
I said I want new faces.

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:54.570
Is that possible?

00:22:55.900 --> 00:23:00.010
You like fresh faces, no repeats.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.370
Abilities up to par, right?

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:07.290
Sure, that's fine, Mr. Don.

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.880
I’ll have my team find more models.

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:11.090
- Alright.
- Alright.

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:12.500
Is Tuesday good, Kin?

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.670
For the new faces you want,

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:17.840
what qualities should they have
to please you?

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:19.630
Pond.

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:22.410
I just want to know.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:25.430
What’s his taste when
it comes to selection?

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:32.270
He likes new faces,
constantly changing.

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:34.530
It’s sad for those who
have already passed...

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:37.190
His eyes.

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:38.600
They’re no longer wanted.

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:44.100
If they’ve already passed my eyes,

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:45.790
I’ve seen them.

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:47.240
I’ve gotten used to it.

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.020
It’s no longer exciting.

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:51.620
Okay, Mr. Don.

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.070
Once used, just discard it.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:58.280
Okay, let's see

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:02.650
if your team can come up
with new ones.

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:03.930
- Alright?
- Alright.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.240
- Absolutely, Mr. Don.
- We’ll find new ones.

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:07.350
I’ll step out to take
a call for a moment.

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:09.520
Go ahead.

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:12.140
I’ll step out for a quick smoke.

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:13.600
Pond.

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:17.240
I’ll go to the accounting.

00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:18.740
- I’ll be back.
- Alright, Akin.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.000
I’ll just...

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:22.090
Stay and look for models.

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:23.600
I'll do it now.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:26.370
Take your time, Mind.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:30.670
Come in.

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:32.920
- Meeting over?
- Not yet.

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:33.940
Just a break.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.300
Are there any missing documents
for this job?

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:41.380
Oh, I’m checking.
Could you check them, please?

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:48.480
- Come in.
- Hello.

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:50.280
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.420
Hello, Uncle.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.310
Hello.

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:55.780
What are you here for?

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:58.300
- Do you want to know?
- Of course.

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:01.750
I’m happy you still want to
know about me.

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:04.110
Don’t get ahead of yourself.
I mean...

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:07.990
This place isn’t for just anyone
to come and go freely.

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:11.710
Who said I’m an outsider?

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:15.260
Oh, they don’t know yet that

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:17.950
you and I used to be...

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:21.800
What do you mean?

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:24.650
We are neighbors, right?

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:31.350
Please make the payment by cheque,
according to the company attached.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.050
Okay, will do.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:37.920
I’ll let you know
once the cheque is ready.

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.490
Thank you.

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:43.210
Don’t forget to walk
the treadmill after work.

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:44.870
For your KPI.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.880
We’re near the evaluation deadline.

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:48.600
Got it.

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.820
Let’s go, Nene.
Our business is done.

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:54.510
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:58.510
- Goodbye. See you next time.
- Goodbye.

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:02.260
Oh, I almost forgot.

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:04.650
I still have one more thing to do.

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:05.300
What else?

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:06.810
It’s about us.

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:10.960
I’m not clear yet,
let’s find a good time to talk.

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:14.330
I’ll leave now.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:15.710
Okay.

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:20.980
What was that about?

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:23.650
I won't tell you.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.780
- Come on, I wants to know.
- No.

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:28.430
Let’s go.

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:31.870
- We’re leaving now. Goodbye!
- Goodbye.

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:32.540
Let’s go.

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:37.750
I won't tell you.

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:51.200
You said you were going to
use the phone.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:53.960
It finished it.

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.100
That was fast.

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:00.180
I need to ask you something.

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:01.840
What is it?

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:04.520
I want you to keep what happened
last night a secret.

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:07.340
What kind of secret
are we talking about?

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:09.470
Should it be top secret?

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:10.940
I don't want anyone to know.

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:14.740
Are you embarrassed
about last night?

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.980
Eating in secret,
not revealing in public.

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:19.940
That’s an old expression.

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:25.600
Let’s just say...

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:30.090
What happened between us
should stay between us.

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:30.880
Okay.

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:34.730
I’m not the type to broadcast
who I’ve slept with.

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:36.070
Good.

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:39.640
You’ve made your request.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.090
Now I have a request.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:42.340
What is it?

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:47.620
The lease on my apartment
is expiring soon,

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:49.500
and the rent is going up.

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:54.010
Your condo... No, aparment.

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:56.100
No, it's not.

00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:57.630
Your penthhouse...

00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:58.830
Why?

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:01.830
I saw you living alone,

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:03.700
and your place is huge.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.920
I want to stay with you
for a while.

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:08.650
Don’t you have friends?

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.840
I do, but I don’t want to
bother them.

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:15.490
But you’d bother me?

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.690
It's fine,
if it’s too much trouble,

00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:20.160
I understand.

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:23.620
I’ll help with your request.

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.130
But if you refuse my request,

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:29.770
I’m not sure when I’m drunk,

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.140
I might accidentally tell someone.

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:33.600
Are you trying to blackmail me?

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:36.320
Isn't that a bit harsh?

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:40.390
I’m just negotiating
the terms of your request.

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:46.290
If you promise to keep
our secret...

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:49.940
If anyone hears it from me,
I’ll move out immediately.

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:51.120
Deal.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:56.090
Good. This is easy. I like it.

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:57.760
No fuss.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:00.540
How long will you stay?

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:04.350
Just for a while.

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:08.420
My wallet’s been
a bit tight lately.

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:10.440
Money always seems
to find a way out.

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:14.350
When I find a new place,

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:16.790
I’ll move out.

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:21.700
Thanks, my valued client

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:24.280
for letting me stay.

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:37.550
One who hasn't worked before.

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:42.680
- Akhin
- Yes?

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:45.440
Mawin, Mawin.

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:47.080
Mawin what?

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:49.480
Let’s show Mawin to Mr.Don first.

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.680
I don't think he’s suitable.
Mawin is shy and not outspoken.

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:54.180
We might waste our time.

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:56.950
- Oh, Akin.
- Yes?

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:58.930
Just try it first.
Let’s present him.

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:02.150
It’s better not to.
Mawin is too shy.

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:04.680
I’ll ask modeling
for more suggestions.

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:06.990
He said both boys
and girls are fine.

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.810
It shouldn't be that difficult.
We still have time.

00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:10.930
Gosh

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:13.940
Look for cute kids,

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:15.770
never worked before.

00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:18.010
Where can we find them?

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:25.100
How’s it going?

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:28.880
Grandpa and Grandma
brought some sausage.

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:30.390
Oh, really?

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:32.520
I know. You don't like it.

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:33.680
Why?

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.140
I will eat it all by herself.

00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:38.430
Nene, share some with me.

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:44.080
- I'll eat it.
- You’ll get fat.

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:49.230
I think I’ve found a new kid
who’s perfect for this product.

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.470
Oh, who is it?

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:53.770
Mind, show it on the screen.

00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:59.170
Oh, Than.

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.680
Oh, is she his daughter?

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:03.110
She’s so cute.

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:04.900
- His niece.
- Oh, really?

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:06.420
You know her, Akin?

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:10.860
Than is a partner of the gym here.

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:12.980
We go there regularly.

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:15.520
Then please take care of
this for me.

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:18.520
Than is so sweet.
There shouldn’t be any problems.

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:19.430
That’s good.

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:23.480
But if there are other kids,
feel free to present them.

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:25.200
- Okay.
- Yes, sure.

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:27.110
We’ll wrap this up quickly.

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:28.990
Thank you all.

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:30.600
Thank you, Mr. Don.

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:32.990
- Thank you.
- I’ll have Fai send you off.

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:34.810
- Sure.
- Fai, please send him off.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:48.960
Hello, Uncle.

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:53.210
Huh? Whose voice is that?

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:55.140
Where are you?
I can hear your voice.

00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:56.600
I’m here.

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:58.790
Oh, here you are.

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:00.760
Why are you here
with your uncle today?

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:03.600
Grandpa and Grandma
just dropped me off.

00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:06.690
Tonight, he will take me shopping.

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:07.950
Oh wow!

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:09.900
I heard there's some
school activity.

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:11.330
She needs to buy a few things.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.800
So it’s yout duty as
a “temporary dad.”

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:17.300
I'm a great uncle.

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:20.970
Let him finish his work here.

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:24.520
How about we go get
some snacks downstairs?

00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:28.700
Good idea!
I just saw a new snack shop open.

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:32.860
Oh, in that case,
let’s go right now!

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:34.190
Come with brother.

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.310
Oh, brother?

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:38.940
What? So I don’t look old?

00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:40.960
We're the same age!

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:43.290
- Same age?
- Yeah.

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:46.580
Let’s go, Nene. Go, go, go!

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:52.360
Same age?

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:04.240
AJ.

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.600
What I want you to do is go in.

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:11.260
Get Nene to be the model for us.

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:16.080
Inform him about the dates,
times, and location clearly.

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:18.300
And ask him about the payment.

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:19.730
- Are you listening?
- Yes.

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:22.050
Right, Nene is Than’s niece.

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:24.460
Oh, but don’t mention me.

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:25.510
Mention Too instead.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.780
But you asked me to do this,
not Too.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.490
Just say it,
he'll be more respectful.

00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:33.340
Got it. I’ll handle it.

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:34.270
Go.

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:45.700
Did you stop by here
just to see me?

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:48.380
No, I was just passing by.

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:49.810
I’ll go now.

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:53.210
See you later, Kin.

00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.210
Oh, AJ.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.720
What are you doing here?
Aren’t you working?

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.330
Is Than here?

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.460
Oh, here he comes.

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:11.940
If you need something,
tell Kin to talk to me.

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:15.150
Okay?

00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:30.110
- Bro.
- How’s it going, AJ?

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:32.600
I didn’t even say anything yet.

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:35.909
Than demanded you to talk to him
if you needed anything.

00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:38.710
I already told you to mention Too.

00:34:38.929 --> 00:34:40.650
I didn’t even get to speak.

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:43.659
Or do you want me to try again?

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:44.960
No, I’ll take care of it myself.

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:05.260
Are you sending Morse code?

00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:10.150
Anything we can do for you?

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:13.000
Want to burn
some calories with cardio?

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:15.250
Or maybe build muscle
with bodyweight exercises?

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:17.280
- Or maybe we can...
- Let’s cut to the point.

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:19.610
What’s the matter?
You look serious.

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:22.640
- Well, we're hoping that...
- Who’s “we?”

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:26.650
- I mean, I would like to...
- Long hair, short hair?

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:28.230
Haircut? Curly hair?

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:30.380
- I mean, my team...
- Which team?

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:31.300
Stop joking around.

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:34.570
I’m not joking.
If I were, it’d be like this...

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.870
I'd be like this.

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:43.380
Sorry, let’s get to the point.

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:47.540
I am hoping to get
Nene to model for me.

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:49.540
I want her to do
a commercial shoot for ice cream.

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:52.320
It’s not going to be free though,
we have payment for her.

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:53.850
- Actually...
- Okay.

00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.960
Sure.

00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:56.300
Huh?

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:04.820
Just tell me what you need.

00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:07.310
You know, I’ll do anything for you.

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:10.050
Alright, I say yes.

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:13.190
You’re not going to
ask for details?

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.840
No need.

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:18.110
Whatever you offer me,
it’s always a good deal.

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:21.030
In this world,
aside from my parents,

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:26.350
you're always there for me,
doing things for me.

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:28.310
Stop bringing up
the same old thing.

00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:32.200
I just think it’s an opportunity.

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:35.210
But even if I agree,

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:37.670
we still need to ask Nene
if she’s okay with it.

00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:39.810
We teach her to think for herself.

00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:41.560
And to make decisions on her own.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.740
No pressure,
just a discussion with reason.

00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:47.220
Then, could you talk to her for me?

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:49.210
You go talk to her yourself.

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:51.580
You have to pick up
your kid anyway.

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:53.910
Alright.

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:59.040
Let’s pick up Nene and Mavin
from school together.

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.240
Good. Imagine this...

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:06.990
When we walk into
the school together,

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:09.280
to pick up our kids,

00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:13.600
anyone will think
we're such a warm family.

00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:15.420
They’ll probably envy us!

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:16.170
Wake up.

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:18.150
Stop daydreaming.

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:21.180
Your hand.
You're taking the chance.

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:29.180
What time are you leaving?

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.290
Can we leave at around 2:30 p.m.?

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:33.710
Okay.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.090
Take my car.

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:36.960
Fine.

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:54.410
Why is my uncle here
with your dad today?

00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:57.570
That's true.

00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.420
Oh, I get it now.

00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:04.400
Your dad works in the same building
as my uncle's gym.

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:08.560
We saw your dad the other day.

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.250
- Hi there!
- Hi!

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:21.470
- Hello!
- Hi there!

00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:25.120
What did you two learn today?

00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:29.970
We learned counting and drawing.

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:32.160
The teacher had us
plant some vegetables.

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:33.910
Did you enjoy it, Mavin?

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:34.780
It was fun!

00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:39.610
Nene, Mavin's dad has something
he wants you to help with.

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:42.790
What is it?

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:46.590
Well, I want you to be a model

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:48.520
for ice cream ads for me.

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:49.870
Would you like to help me out?

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:51.200
I'd love to!

00:38:51.450 --> 00:38:53.920
But being an ice cream model...

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:56.050
Will I really get to
eat the ice cream?

00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.180
Of course!

00:38:57.540 --> 00:38:59.300
I’ll pay you for your work too.

00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:03.030
Then can I take a cut
as your manager?

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:05.700
- How much?
- 50.

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:07.120
50 percent?

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:08.310
50 baht.

00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:09.770
Wow, Nene.

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:11.660
At this rate, I'll get rich!

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:14.560
Can I come to watch too?

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:19.060
Sure, but the set will be crowded,
and you'll wait for a long time.

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:20.620
We’ll be shooting nearly all day.

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:23.430
It’s fine. I can stay.

00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:25.500
I want to see Nene become a star.

00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:27.530
And I want to watch you work too.

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:32.360
Great! She will have a friend
and won’t get bored.

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.500
Your mouth is all messy.
Oh, it’s too good!

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:58.080
Akin sent a message saying

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:01.070
Nene has agreed to model for us.

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:03.570
Oh, that's great!

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:06.270
See? Akin is always reliable.

00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:07.700
He never lets us down.

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:09.650
Then inform Mr. Don.

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:12.250
Sure, I’ll call his secretary.

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:16.170
Alright, the model issue is settled.

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:17.790
So let's hurry and finish the work.

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:19.720
Make sure there are
no problems or mistakes.

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:21.880
Mr. Don's work must be perfect.

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:24.480
- Because we are…
- Beyond Perfect.

00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:27.190
House of Perfection

00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:29.110
- Yes.
- Very good.

00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:30.340
Oh, and one more thing.

00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:32.670
Don’t forget
your health assessment.

00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:35.560
Don’t just work.
Find some time to go to the gym.

00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:37.490
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:50.690
Do you want me to help carry that?

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:53.180
No, it’s fine.

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:04.760
Can I ask you something?
Who is Mavin’s mom?

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.590
I want to know
when you stopped loving me

00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:15.200
and started loving someone else?

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:20.820
Can you tell me?

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:24.060
Why don’t I know anything?

00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:35.260
I never stop loving you.

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:43.850
Can you please tell me?

00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:47.230
Please help me
understand everything.

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:50.730
I’m really confused right now.

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.100
I don’t know how I should feel

00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:55.330
about we meeting again.

00:41:56.290 --> 00:41:57.530
And your son.

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:06.440
Something is probably
better not to know.

00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:27.600
Hello, Pond. Hello!

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.010
First shoot, good luck, Nene!

00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:35.910
Oh, hey!

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:39.170
Oh, Than!

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:41.220
Wow, it’s been a long time!

00:42:41.350 --> 00:42:42.950
- How’ve you been?
- It’s okay.

00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:46.440
This is your daughter?
She’s all grown up now!

00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:48.260
This is Sun’s daughter.

00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:50.520
Sun’s daughter?

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:53.230
Say hi to Uncle Pond.

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:55.410
- Hi!
- Hi, Uncle Pond!

00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:57.800
He is a friend of your dad.

00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:01.210
I used to work with your dad
when we were still in school.

00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:04.880
Oh, so what brings you here?

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:06.300
I’m an advertising photographer.

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:08.750
Sometimes I shoot fashion too.

00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:10.460
I’m here for a shoot
with this agency.

00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:13.510
Wow, that’s such a coincidence!

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:15.840
I’m also bringing her
for this shoot.

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:17.460
Really?

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:20.760
Hello, Nene. Than!

00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:22.940
- Hello.
- Alright, let’s get you dressed.

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:23.980
Okay, let’s go.

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:25.710
- See you.
- See you, brother.

00:43:26.490 --> 00:43:28.020
Okay, ready, start shooting.

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:31.520
If you need anything,
just let me know.

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:34.010
One, two...

00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:36.090
Like this.

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:38.590
Turn the logo, please.

00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:41.110
This one is cute. So cute.

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:43.310
So cute, Nene.

00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:45.840
Why are you so cute?

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:47.990
This is her first job, you know.

00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:49.410
- Really?
- Yes, it is.

00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:51.580
She’s perfect for the product.

00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:54.520
Okay, this one is good.

00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:56.340
One more time, please.
Just put it at the head again.

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:02.730
They want it removed.
They want a white color.

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:03.610
Okay, got it.

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:08.120
The jar over there,
please close it.

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:10.030
Show the flavor, please.

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:12.080
It’s her first job.
Her very first job.

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:14.510
- Really? Wow.
- Yes, make her look brighter.

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:23.910
Coffee and water.

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:24.970
Thank you.

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:30.780
Nene, change the pose, please.
Let's do it like this.

00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:34.080
Okay.

00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:36.000
Ken, let’s add a stop.

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:37.320
Got it.

00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:45.950
Okay, Nene,
you can take a break now.

00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:57.960
Are you tired?

00:44:58.510 --> 00:45:01.570
- Not at all.
- Great job. You’re amazing.

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:02.970
You’re awesome, Nene.

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:05.920
You really got to eat ice cream.
Was it good?

00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:09.100
Of course. If it’s from the client,
it has to be delicious.

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:10.340
My uncle said so.

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:12.820
That’s how it should be.

00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:14.930
Thank you.

00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:16.280
Thank you.

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:25.610
Great job, Nene.

00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:27.540
Wow, so professional.

00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:28.430
This one is good.

00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:30.950
- Thank you, Than.
- I think this one is good too.

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:33.640
This one’s good.

00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:36.590
This set looks great
in every photo.

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.210
What do you think?

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:46.440
I feel like it’s missing something.

00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:53.450
- Akin.
- Yes?

00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:01.850
I need your opinion.
I think something is missing,

00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:03.620
but I still can’t figure it out.

00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:06.830
Is it the hairstyle or the outfit?

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:08.930
Or...

00:46:13.530 --> 00:46:14.540
I got it now.

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:17.860
I want that boy to take pictures
with Nene too.

00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:20.330
Make it look like they’re inviting
friends to eat together.

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:22.610
The solo shots of Nene...

00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:24.490
I think it’s all good.

00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:27.460
But let’s add a girl and boy
duo to the set.

00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:30.330
And Pond...

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:32.720
It would be nice if we could get
a solo shot of the boy.

00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:36.250
I think there are some pieces
that the client needs.

00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:37.550
I have no problem with that.

00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:41.840
I’ll need to ask for permission
from his father first.

00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:43.480
He's the son of Akin.

00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:46.100
Yes, he's my son.

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:47.600
That’s good.

00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:49.970
Shouldn't be a problem?

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.810
And what about the costumes?

00:46:54.830 --> 00:46:56.420
Oh, don’t worry, Akin.

00:46:57.130 --> 00:46:59.400
- We can take care of that.
- We can do that right away.

00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:01.470
- Fai.
- Yes?

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:03.470
Costumes.

00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:05.090
Find the costumes.

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:11.650
Thank you so much, Meya.

00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:13.590
Mawin wants to shoot too.

00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:15.680
But I said I need to
ask his mom first.

00:47:17.590 --> 00:47:21.180
Don’t worry.
Mawin is like my own child.

00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:24.270
I’ll send you the video
from the shoot later.

00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:26.920
Okay.

00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:34.750
The snacks are here.

00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:36.670
Oh wow.

00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:38.320
Hello, Nut.

00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:42.780
Are you here to cheer for
Nene or Than?

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:44.630
Uh...

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:47.970
Here you are.

00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:50.270
This is for you.

00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:51.390
Thank you.

00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:53.480
What about mine?

00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:58.050
How could I forget, My good girl?

00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:02.220
Here you go, this cocoa drink.

00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:03.540
Thank you.

00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:05.950
Did you have fun today?

00:48:06.310 --> 00:48:08.660
Yes, it was really fun.

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:15.210
Nene, honey,
you still have two sets left.

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:17.740
The first one is with Mawin.

00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:20.310
Then the next one is solo,
then it'll be done.

00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:21.340
Okay.

00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:24.280
Send someone to check on Mawin.

00:48:24.590 --> 00:48:27.280
Is he done yet?
If he is, we’re ready to shoot.

00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.800
Let’s continue.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.170
- Great job, Mawin.
- Great job.

00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:48.760
Okay, your set is done, Mawin.
You can change and head home.

00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:50.900
Nene will change for her last set.

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:52.260
Let’s change your dress.

00:48:54.810 --> 00:48:58.070
Mawin, how about we race?

00:48:58.330 --> 00:49:00.660
Whoever gets to
the dressing room first wins.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:01.850
Sure.

00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:03.840
One, two, three.

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:05.620
Ouch!

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:07.110
- Hey!
- Oh no!

00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:08.290
- Hey!
- Oh!

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:12.180
Mawin, don't move just yet.
Let me check.

00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:13.940
It hurts, Uncle.

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:16.800
Mawin, how are you?

00:49:17.810 --> 00:49:21.190
He might hit his head on the pole,
and use his arm to break the fall.

00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:25.010
Let’s do some first aid
before we take him to the hospital.

00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:29.240
The first aid kit is here.

00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:30.700
Hold on.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.430
Call the van to take
Mawin to the hospital.

00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:36.660
Tell him to wait outside.

00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:38.090
Okay.

00:49:39.690 --> 00:49:40.700
Ouch, it hurts.

00:49:46.210 --> 00:49:47.360
Does this hurt here?

00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:48.680
Yes, it hurts.

00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:50.480
Yes, it hurts.

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:20.430
Hey, Than!

00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:28.210
Than, does it hurt?

00:50:29.110 --> 00:50:29.850
Just a little bit.

00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:31.540
Are you okay?

00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:34.390
Getting sympathy
from your boyfriend?

00:50:35.170 --> 00:50:36.670
Stop teasing me.

00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:39.740
- Hey, go!
- Sit and rest for now.

00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:45.770
Blow on it, so it heals.

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:47.360
How old are you?

00:50:47.730 --> 00:50:48.300
Ouch.

00:50:59.310 --> 00:51:00.050
Is it better now?

00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:00.860
Oops!

00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:04.680
It’s totally healed!

00:51:05.550 --> 00:51:06.900
You’re exaggerating!

00:51:10.090 --> 00:51:10.930
Thank you.

00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:15.820
Hey, let’s resume, guys!

00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:19.830
- Come on.
- Go, go, go!

00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:32.230
Play carefully,
or you’ll fall again.

00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:44.720
Hello.

00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:46.470
It’s Meya.

00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:48.390
I just wanted to tell you...

00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:50.520
I'm pregnant.

00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:51.980
Pregnant?

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:55.350
Hold on a second. Who is this?

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.890
- It’s Meya, we met at...
- Actually...

00:51:58.450 --> 00:51:59.770
I’m not the owner of this phone.

00:52:00.330 --> 00:52:02.080
He is unavailable to take the call.

00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:04.750
Please have him call me back.

00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:05.760
Okay.

00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:32.000
Sorry, it’s Akin,
We were talking just now.

00:52:33.790 --> 00:52:35.060
I have something I want to discuss.

00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:37.020
Is it convenient
for you to meet me?

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:05.780
The baby in is his son.

00:53:17.050 --> 00:53:19.060
Excuse me, where is
the finance department?

00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:22.110
Mawin, does anywhere else hurt?

00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:24.230
What happened to your neck?

00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:25.650
It’s just an ant bite.

00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:27.110
The matters of the heart
comes first?

00:53:28.410 --> 00:53:30.780
And where does work rank?

00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:34.220
Don’t just chase after him
and let your life fall apart.

00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:37.650
Why doesn’t Mawin have
your last name?

00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:40.970
Or he is not really your son?

00:53:41.850 --> 00:53:43.570
- Why did you poke me?
- One more, please.

00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:44.530
No.
