00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:35.451

00:00:50.855 --> 00:00:52.175
Are you sure

00:00:54.435 --> 00:00:56.155
that you

00:00:57.585 --> 00:00:58.665
want all the memories back?

00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:19.745
I want the truth

00:01:35.405 --> 00:01:36.655
I know this song.

00:01:47.225 --> 00:01:48.225
I can remember now!

00:01:50.135 --> 00:01:51.215
I can remember now!

00:01:58.825 --> 00:01:59.825
Tankhun!

00:02:00.125 --> 00:02:01.125
Tankhun!

00:02:01.505 --> 00:02:02.515
Tankhun!

00:02:03.335 --> 00:02:04.335
Tankhun!

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:37.735
Have you ever had the same dream repeatedly?

00:03:41.815 --> 00:03:43.515
A dream about someone

00:03:46.075 --> 00:03:47.175
who was your first love.

00:03:53.175 --> 00:03:56.495
I met him in winter, the warmest winter.

00:04:17.135 --> 00:04:18.135
Tankhun!

00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:22.875
A nightmare again?

00:04:27.385 --> 00:04:28.645
Did I wake you up, Grandma?

00:04:30.495 --> 00:04:32.235
Don’t forget to visit the doctor today.

00:04:53.125 --> 00:04:55.735
If dreams arise from the subconscious mind,

00:04:56.125 --> 00:04:59.615
my dreams would be far too mysterious
beyond anticipation.

00:05:00.875 --> 00:05:03.895
Because I lost my memories 10 years ago.

00:05:04.375 --> 00:05:05.375
Botpleng!

00:05:06.735 --> 00:05:07.845
Botpleng!

00:05:09.275 --> 00:05:10.275
Botpleng!

00:05:33.715 --> 00:05:35.135
What happened, Mom?

00:05:50.745 --> 00:05:51.945
“Recurring dreams”.

00:05:52.575 --> 00:05:54.391
A condition of having the same dreams repeatedly.

00:05:54.415 --> 00:05:55.955
It can arise from many causes.

00:05:56.525 --> 00:05:58.335
Maybe because of stress,

00:05:58.755 --> 00:06:01.135
unresolved past trauma,

00:06:02.085 --> 00:06:04.035
or if you think

00:06:04.065 --> 00:06:06.775
it was your real memory that was lost

00:06:06.805 --> 00:06:08.475
then that’s also possible.

00:06:08.875 --> 00:06:12.095
Then… what do I do, Doctor?

00:06:15.785 --> 00:06:18.465
The human brain is complex.

00:06:19.465 --> 00:06:24.745
But there’s one thing that links well
with the brain’s functioning.

00:06:25.305 --> 00:06:28.505
That is us working together
to find the triggering factor.

00:06:30.935 --> 00:06:32.935
Can you tell me—

00:06:33.215 --> 00:06:35.305
Before you had this dream,

00:06:35.985 --> 00:06:37.485
what were you doing

00:06:38.215 --> 00:06:40.215
or what did you encounter?

00:06:40.835 --> 00:06:41.835
Yes.

00:06:42.125 --> 00:06:44.585
Something triggered my memory.

00:06:49.835 --> 00:06:52.535
7 DAYS AGO

00:07:00.905 --> 00:07:01.665
Boss!

00:07:01.685 --> 00:07:02.515
Boss!

00:07:02.545 --> 00:07:03.975
We’re getting sued again!

00:07:04.015 --> 00:07:04.435
Fight back.

00:07:04.455 --> 00:07:06.435
Say it’s the freedom of the press.

00:07:07.565 --> 00:07:09.375
Hey, I think this picture’s too sensitive.

00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:10.395
Take that down.

00:07:11.735 --> 00:07:13.475
O, don’t forget to sensor this time.

00:07:13.695 --> 00:07:14.365
Got it, Boss!

00:07:14.395 --> 00:07:15.575
I won’t miss it this time.

00:07:18.815 --> 00:07:20.055
I found the word “gosh!”.

00:07:20.095 --> 00:07:22.195
Paragraph 3,
you put your emotions in it again.

00:07:22.225 --> 00:07:23.295
Fix it now.

00:07:23.575 --> 00:07:25.475
Oh! But I feel so involved!

00:07:25.735 --> 00:07:27.325
You’re a journalist

00:07:27.345 --> 00:07:28.345
not just some people on the internet!

00:07:28.365 --> 00:07:30.345
Leave the commenting part to the netizens!

00:07:35.385 --> 00:07:37.105
You’re all worked up
right from the morning.

00:07:38.083 --> 00:07:40.085
Just how it goes during quarter transitions.

00:07:41.499 --> 00:07:42.499
By the way.

00:07:42.835 --> 00:07:44.475
Why did you ask me to come in?

00:07:44.859 --> 00:07:46.715
Are you not okay with
the headline I proposed?

00:07:46.747 --> 00:07:47.635
No.

00:07:47.665 --> 00:07:49.083
I was throwing away some old printing plates

00:07:49.107 --> 00:07:50.707
and found a parcel I forgot to give you.

00:07:51.425 --> 00:07:52.425
A parcel?

00:07:53.865 --> 00:07:54.865
Here.

00:07:55.375 --> 00:07:57.055
So I won’t forget to give it to you again.

00:07:58.885 --> 00:08:00.605
I never have anything shipped here, though.

00:08:01.175 --> 00:08:02.635
It was addressed to you.

00:08:02.659 --> 00:08:04.347
If it’s not yours, then whose could it be?

00:08:04.975 --> 00:08:05.975
Here you go.

00:08:06.195 --> 00:08:07.731
If you’re curious, then open it up.

00:08:07.763 --> 00:08:08.995
I’m also curious.

00:08:39.985 --> 00:08:42.115
Mom wants me to learn the violin

00:08:42.147 --> 00:08:43.627
so that I can be good at it like dad.

00:08:44.745 --> 00:08:45.563
Mom probably wants to hear

00:08:45.595 --> 00:08:47.095
the sound of Dad’s violin again.

00:08:48.095 --> 00:08:49.667
But I can’t even remember

00:08:50.135 --> 00:08:51.347
what it sounded like.

00:08:59.765 --> 00:09:02.067
I’ve heard “Canon in D”
so many times before.

00:09:03.225 --> 00:09:04.979
But no one could play it the way he did.

00:09:35.975 --> 00:09:37.331
I saw him

00:09:37.675 --> 00:09:39.531
after following the sound of the violin

00:09:39.555 --> 00:09:41.155
all the way to that tree.

00:09:52.265 --> 00:09:53.265
Uh…

00:09:54.405 --> 00:09:55.405
Hi.

00:09:56.875 --> 00:09:58.675
He said his name was “Tankhun”.

00:09:59.245 --> 00:10:02.475
We met in winter when we were 17.

00:10:04.225 --> 00:10:07.291
Tan made me enjoy the violin
for the first time.

00:10:07.935 --> 00:10:10.099
Just like getting to know love
for the first time.

00:10:10.805 --> 00:10:13.259
Did you forget to tell me anything, Pleng?

00:10:17.855 --> 00:10:18.855
No.

00:10:20.255 --> 00:10:21.691
These days, I’ve probably been…

00:10:22.295 --> 00:10:24.083
too obsessed with work.

00:10:24.535 --> 00:10:26.075
So my head’s chaotic.

00:10:26.585 --> 00:10:27.603
Then

00:10:28.135 --> 00:10:30.531
I’ll give you some stress-relieving pills.

00:10:30.935 --> 00:10:31.935
Yes.

00:10:32.185 --> 00:10:36.163
If anything else is disturbing you mentally
in addition to what you told me,

00:10:36.187 --> 00:10:37.691
then you have to let me know.

00:10:38.015 --> 00:10:39.455
So that we can work it out together.

00:10:40.295 --> 00:10:42.563
Your mom will probably be happy about it.

00:11:47.155 --> 00:11:48.155
Mom.

00:11:50.095 --> 00:11:52.651
What happened between Tankhun and me?

00:11:55.235 --> 00:11:57.443
Why didn’t you tell me anything about it?

00:12:14.345 --> 00:12:15.691
If you don’t believe it

00:12:16.055 --> 00:12:18.335
then why didn’t you tell
your grandma and doctor about it?

00:12:20.505 --> 00:12:22.107
Because if it’s not true,

00:12:23.145 --> 00:12:24.619
then what does the sender want?

00:12:24.865 --> 00:12:26.339
To work you up.

00:12:26.865 --> 00:12:28.635
You’re having a wild dream.

00:12:29.265 --> 00:12:29.739
Let’s see.

00:12:29.763 --> 00:12:31.735
Let me see what’s freaking written there

00:12:31.763 --> 00:12:33.123
that even make you dream about it?

00:12:34.165 --> 00:12:36.107
You’re sticking your nose
even in your friend’s business?

00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:36.747
Damn you.

00:12:36.883 --> 00:12:37.691
What?

00:12:37.723 --> 00:12:39.083
I’m being generous.

00:12:39.375 --> 00:12:41.291
Maybe I can help you find more clues.

00:12:41.331 --> 00:12:42.691
If you want to stick your nose in

00:12:42.723 --> 00:12:44.083
then just say so.

00:12:45.055 --> 00:12:46.455
So are you going to let me do that?

00:12:47.125 --> 00:12:48.211
No, I’m not.

00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:52.235
My detective skills are just as good as yours.

00:12:52.575 --> 00:12:53.739
I already sent an email.

00:12:55.225 --> 00:12:56.225
An email?

00:12:56.735 --> 00:12:57.675
What email?

00:12:57.707 --> 00:12:58.715
Whose email?

00:12:59.139 --> 00:13:01.135
His email is there in the diary.

00:13:01.505 --> 00:13:02.987
The lover I can’t remember.

00:13:04.735 --> 00:13:05.851
Did he reply?

00:13:19.365 --> 00:13:22.005
(Hi, Tankhun. Sorry I’ve been missing.)
Are you back now, Botpleng?

00:13:22.035 --> 00:13:23.331
Can we meet?

00:13:25.455 --> 00:13:26.455
Yes.

00:13:28.225 --> 00:13:29.627
Are you out of your mind?

00:13:29.643 --> 00:13:31.739
You don’t even know him.

00:13:31.771 --> 00:13:33.059
You can’t even remember him.

00:13:33.705 --> 00:13:36.603
Also, you don’t even believe it’s true.

00:13:38.605 --> 00:13:39.691
Then check this out.

00:13:42.865 --> 00:13:43.865
Look.

00:13:44.645 --> 00:13:46.883
Then tell me this is not my handwriting.

00:13:49.605 --> 00:13:50.627
So what?

00:13:51.025 --> 00:13:52.667
It’s been 10 years.

00:13:52.683 --> 00:13:54.723
Who in their right mind would have
sent this to you?

00:13:54.995 --> 00:13:56.579
It might be Tankhun.

00:14:02.435 --> 00:14:04.187
Alright, I get it.

00:14:04.775 --> 00:14:07.179
I’m meeting him out in the open.

00:14:07.603 --> 00:14:09.763
(Do you want me to put off my meeting
and go with you?)

00:14:10.535 --> 00:14:13.415
Damn, do you want the revenue department
to call you in for another year?

00:14:13.755 --> 00:14:15.243
(You’re really–)

00:14:15.575 --> 00:14:16.867
I’m hanging up.

00:14:17.095 --> 00:14:19.055
There’s not going to be any signals from here on.

00:14:19.095 --> 00:14:20.283
(You remember?)

00:14:22.015 --> 00:14:23.015
Yeah.

00:14:23.725 --> 00:14:24.875
Of course, I do.

00:14:26.979 --> 00:14:28.587
It feels like coming home.

00:14:30.443 --> 00:14:32.403
I’ve never been here again.

00:14:33.095 --> 00:14:35.363
Since the accident 10 years ago.

00:14:36.115 --> 00:14:38.475
But among all the memories I’ve lost,

00:14:39.055 --> 00:14:40.571
I feel like

00:14:40.595 --> 00:14:42.683
there’s a hint of memory about this place.

00:14:46.895 --> 00:14:48.555
I feel familiar.

00:14:48.935 --> 00:14:50.179
Yearning.

00:14:51.963 --> 00:14:55.299
As if Canon in D is playing in my head all the time.

00:15:11.675 --> 00:15:12.675
Tankhun.

00:15:35.795 --> 00:15:36.795
Tankhun.

00:15:40.015 --> 00:15:41.339
Is that you?

00:15:46.845 --> 00:15:48.075
Where are you?

00:16:20.955 --> 00:16:21.955
Shit!

00:16:35.059 --> 00:16:36.083
I’m Tankhun.

00:16:36.615 --> 00:16:37.763
Your lover.

00:16:44.495 --> 00:16:46.019
I’ve been waiting for you for so long.

00:16:52.745 --> 00:16:53.955
Are you the murderer?

00:16:56.265 --> 00:16:57.555
What do you think?

00:17:08.705 --> 00:17:09.915
Turn yourself in.

00:17:10.575 --> 00:17:11.655
You can’t get away with it.

00:17:11.875 --> 00:17:13.307
I’m not the murderer.

00:17:14.175 --> 00:17:15.899
I’m also the one who called the police.

00:17:16.375 --> 00:17:17.779
They’re just as late as you are.

00:17:20.695 --> 00:17:22.059
Thai people’s time, I guess.

00:17:32.163 --> 00:17:33.163
Yes.

00:17:33.747 --> 00:17:35.745
Everything’s according to the manual.

00:17:35.965 --> 00:17:38.515
I’ll have to interrogate everyone involved.

00:17:39.935 --> 00:17:40.935
Inspector.

00:17:43.095 --> 00:17:44.095
Yes.

00:17:48.285 --> 00:17:49.771
What have we got, Lt. Nim?

00:17:50.555 --> 00:17:52.883
He’s the one who watches over the house
of the Thayadon family.

00:17:52.907 --> 00:17:54.315
The family of Mr. Botpleng,

00:17:54.339 --> 00:17:55.819
the one who discovered the dead body.

00:18:00.445 --> 00:18:01.445
Nice.

00:18:02.095 --> 00:18:03.811
So we won’t have to do much interrogation.

00:18:29.205 --> 00:18:30.891
Do you know the deceased?

00:18:35.295 --> 00:18:36.587
I don’t know him personally.

00:18:38.105 --> 00:18:40.515
I only know that my grandma
hired someone to watch over the house.

00:18:40.539 --> 00:18:42.267
Then why did he send you a parcel?

00:18:42.735 --> 00:18:43.735
What did you say?

00:18:43.965 --> 00:18:45.315
2 weeks ago,

00:18:46.115 --> 00:18:47.667
a boy from another country,

00:18:47.683 --> 00:18:49.315
with no friends

00:18:49.355 --> 00:18:51.011
and no social life,

00:18:51.455 --> 00:18:54.075
sent a parcel to Mr. Botpleng Thayadon.

00:18:54.655 --> 00:18:56.083
Someone who doesn’t even know him.

00:19:06.459 --> 00:19:07.627
What did he send you?

00:19:09.145 --> 00:19:10.145
Well.

00:19:10.425 --> 00:19:12.091
He sent me a diary.

00:19:12.935 --> 00:19:14.547
But I’ve just found out from you

00:19:14.579 --> 00:19:16.131
that he was the sender.

00:19:18.015 --> 00:19:19.251
How did you feel

00:19:19.275 --> 00:19:20.379
when you saw the diary?

00:19:21.305 --> 00:19:22.305
Pardon?

00:19:22.575 --> 00:19:24.059
Were you happy?

00:19:24.083 --> 00:19:25.219
Sad?

00:19:25.785 --> 00:19:27.945
Or did you feel like you were pressured
or blackmailed?

00:19:30.945 --> 00:19:32.483
Are you suspecting me, officer?

00:19:35.725 --> 00:19:36.539
The thing is,

00:19:36.563 --> 00:19:38.691
I’m searching for the likelihood here.

00:19:40.185 --> 00:19:42.595
The deceased just sent you a parcel.

00:19:43.065 --> 00:19:44.659
Then a week later,

00:19:44.699 --> 00:19:46.867
you turned out to be the one
who found his body.

00:19:49.025 --> 00:19:50.505
Isn’t that too much of a coincidence?

00:19:53.615 --> 00:19:55.655
I’m here because I have an appointment
with someone.

00:19:56.723 --> 00:19:58.725
How can I make him ask me to come here?

00:19:59.535 --> 00:20:02.483
If you want evidence, I have it.

00:20:03.165 --> 00:20:04.419
Then who asked you to come?

00:20:10.435 --> 00:20:11.435
Lover.

00:20:16.855 --> 00:20:18.003
Tankhun.

00:20:20.135 --> 00:20:21.235
My lover.

00:20:25.135 --> 00:20:27.459
Tankhun is your lover?

00:20:31.055 --> 00:20:32.171
I don’t know.

00:20:42.735 --> 00:20:43.835
I can’t remember.

00:20:45.825 --> 00:20:47.307
His body language is normal.

00:20:47.355 --> 00:20:49.027
Open and not hiding anything.

00:20:49.043 --> 00:20:50.499
Slightly nervous

00:20:51.695 --> 00:20:53.187
but still at a normal level.

00:20:58.035 --> 00:20:59.739
Are you sure he’s not lying?

00:21:00.205 --> 00:21:01.205
For sure?

00:21:01.455 --> 00:21:02.455
For sure.

00:21:02.785 --> 00:21:05.305
Coming from the only body language
decipherer of the department.

00:21:10.185 --> 00:21:11.435
The same goes for me.

00:21:12.125 --> 00:21:13.267
I’m not lying.

00:21:14.531 --> 00:21:15.531
You knew?

00:21:15.695 --> 00:21:17.187
You’re reading my body language.

00:21:18.515 --> 00:21:19.891
I’m just trying it out.

00:21:21.975 --> 00:21:23.859
He can’t remember you

00:21:23.899 --> 00:21:25.539
but you can remember him.

00:21:25.995 --> 00:21:28.267
Maybe you want to protect him

00:21:28.575 --> 00:21:29.675
due to personal reasons.

00:21:34.045 --> 00:21:35.045
That’s right.

00:21:37.475 --> 00:21:38.475
Yeah.

00:21:39.265 --> 00:21:40.483
What you said is right.

00:21:40.775 --> 00:21:42.243
I have reasons to do that.

00:21:42.855 --> 00:21:44.115
But what about Botpleng?

00:21:44.139 --> 00:21:46.139
What could be the reasons
for him to kill that man?

00:21:47.705 --> 00:21:49.611
You can try to figure out the reasons.

00:21:50.045 --> 00:21:51.707
But you can’t detain Botpleng like that.

00:21:52.255 --> 00:21:53.707
Not just his family,

00:21:54.495 --> 00:21:55.495
even for me,

00:21:56.095 --> 00:21:57.255
I don’t find that acceptable.

00:22:02.763 --> 00:22:06.459
(Murder with dismemberment of the body.)

00:22:09.147 --> 00:22:10.307
Oh, hey.

00:22:10.323 --> 00:22:11.571
How are you doing?

00:22:13.775 --> 00:22:14.775
I’m okay.

00:22:14.825 --> 00:22:17.491
By the way, I got a new headline.

00:22:17.515 --> 00:22:19.299
I’ll draft it up and send it to you.

00:22:21.571 --> 00:22:23.575
You still have the guts for that right now?

00:22:23.875 --> 00:22:26.523
Well, I’m an early Gen Z

00:22:26.555 --> 00:22:27.955
who has inherited some Gen Y’s DNA.

00:22:29.865 --> 00:22:30.865
By the way,

00:22:31.055 --> 00:22:33.675
what about the thing I’ve asked you?

00:22:34.215 --> 00:22:35.363
Don’t worry.

00:22:35.395 --> 00:22:37.723
They didn’t want your grandma
to know anyway.

00:22:37.755 --> 00:22:40.427
They didn’t even want to interrogate you at first.

00:22:40.451 --> 00:22:43.331
But the police officer who’s in charge
of the case wouldn’t let it slide.

00:22:44.095 --> 00:22:45.095
Thanks.

00:22:45.485 --> 00:22:47.643
It’s so nice having you as my friend.

00:22:48.085 --> 00:22:49.211
How nice.

00:22:49.755 --> 00:22:51.683
Instead of worrying about your case,

00:22:52.163 --> 00:22:54.523
you’re more worried about
your grandma finding out about it.

00:22:55.825 --> 00:22:59.963
Actually, you should just let her know.

00:23:00.003 --> 00:23:01.307
So you can go home today.

00:23:02.495 --> 00:23:03.715
You know full well.

00:23:03.755 --> 00:23:04.859
If my grandma knows about this,

00:23:04.883 --> 00:23:06.483
do you think I’d get to come here today?

00:23:07.225 --> 00:23:09.875
Also, if they want to interrogate,
then go ahead.

00:23:09.907 --> 00:23:10.907
I’m chill about it.

00:23:11.275 --> 00:23:12.139
I didn’t do anything wrong

00:23:12.155 --> 00:23:13.507
and I also got a job done.

00:23:13.531 --> 00:23:14.531
Here.

00:23:14.565 --> 00:23:15.979
Alright, whatever.

00:23:16.419 --> 00:23:17.419
By the way.

00:23:17.805 --> 00:23:19.275
When can you go home?

00:23:20.611 --> 00:23:21.611
No idea.

00:23:24.255 --> 00:23:25.851
You may go home now.

00:23:26.515 --> 00:23:29.291
Uh, what about Tankhun?

00:23:35.795 --> 00:23:37.795
Then you can just go home with me.

00:23:37.835 --> 00:23:39.707
Leave your car here and pick it up later.

00:23:40.565 --> 00:23:41.565
You can head back first.

00:23:55.635 --> 00:23:56.955
You don’t look like

00:23:56.995 --> 00:23:58.907
someone who has just been interrogated.

00:23:58.931 --> 00:24:00.699
You’re no longer a suspect.

00:24:01.265 --> 00:24:03.027
The police didn’t find the weapon

00:24:03.067 --> 00:24:04.379
nor any linking witness.

00:24:04.675 --> 00:24:06.843
The initial hypothesis is that

00:24:07.185 --> 00:24:08.545
everything was just a coincidence.

00:24:13.565 --> 00:24:14.723
Let me ask you for real.

00:24:15.985 --> 00:24:17.251
Who really are you?

00:24:24.485 --> 00:24:26.155
I’m a criminologist

00:24:26.195 --> 00:24:28.867
who works at the
Criminal Investigation Department.

00:24:30.655 --> 00:24:32.867
Do you cooperate with
the local police station, too?

00:24:34.625 --> 00:24:36.299
I knew Inspector Dao

00:24:36.323 --> 00:24:37.883
when she was taking a course in the UK.

00:24:39.405 --> 00:24:41.219
Because you know Inspector Dao,

00:24:41.855 --> 00:24:43.307
so you don’t get interrogated?

00:24:43.347 --> 00:24:45.099
So I was the first to be interrogated.

00:24:45.139 --> 00:24:48.291
I’m also your only witness

00:24:48.339 --> 00:24:50.475
proving that you came according
to my appointment.

00:24:51.655 --> 00:24:52.667
One more thing.

00:24:55.995 --> 00:24:59.331
You can’t remember me, but I can.

00:24:59.975 --> 00:25:02.915
I can remember who Botpleng’s first love is.

00:25:06.845 --> 00:25:08.747
Who Botpleng’s first love is.

00:25:08.771 --> 00:25:10.307
Who Botpleng’s first love is.

00:25:10.815 --> 00:25:12.427
Who Botpleng’s first love is.

00:25:13.875 --> 00:25:14.875
Are you okay?

00:25:16.555 --> 00:25:17.555
Hey!

00:25:17.775 --> 00:25:18.775
Botpleng!

00:25:20.215 --> 00:25:21.051
I’m fine.

00:25:21.091 --> 00:25:22.091
I’m okay.

00:25:23.475 --> 00:25:25.587
Don’t overlook your symptoms

00:25:25.619 --> 00:25:27.011
even if it’s something minor.

00:25:30.015 --> 00:25:31.291
I’m really alright.

00:25:31.935 --> 00:25:33.299
This is not the first time.

00:25:34.535 --> 00:25:35.535
It’s migraine.

00:25:48.645 --> 00:25:49.995
I’ll get going, please excuse me.

00:25:50.035 --> 00:25:51.067
I’ll see you.

00:25:58.575 --> 00:26:00.211
I wasn’t being your witness

00:26:00.251 --> 00:26:01.531
for you to head back to Bangkok.

00:26:01.855 --> 00:26:04.323
I’ve waited for you for 10 years, Botpleng.

00:26:18.075 --> 00:26:21.011
Did the caretaker clean this house at all?

00:26:28.045 --> 00:26:29.187
He just passed away.

00:26:29.455 --> 00:26:30.531
He won’t come to see you.

00:26:31.085 --> 00:26:32.115
Who knows?

00:26:37.015 --> 00:26:38.219
It’s filled with dust.

00:26:38.695 --> 00:26:39.699
You can’t stay here.

00:26:39.965 --> 00:26:41.125
Let’s go to my house instead.

00:26:41.625 --> 00:26:43.043
I lost my memories,

00:26:43.415 --> 00:26:44.415
but I’m not stupid.

00:26:45.785 --> 00:26:48.307
Don’t act as if you can always seduce me.

00:26:48.355 --> 00:26:49.947
How can I ever seduce you?

00:26:50.845 --> 00:26:51.845
If I wanted to,

00:26:53.105 --> 00:26:54.505
then I could just do it right here.

00:26:55.655 --> 00:26:56.867
Also,

00:26:57.675 --> 00:26:58.883
our houses are not far apart.

00:27:00.225 --> 00:27:01.225
Not far?

00:27:02.575 --> 00:27:03.667
How close?

00:27:11.665 --> 00:27:12.931
Do you want to be reminded?

00:27:52.755 --> 00:27:53.755
Does it feel familiar?

00:27:57.885 --> 00:27:59.115
Have I ever been here before?

00:28:00.145 --> 00:28:01.145
No.

00:28:03.235 --> 00:28:04.235
Finding faults?

00:28:05.545 --> 00:28:06.825
What is there for me to do that?

00:28:08.985 --> 00:28:10.083
I don’t know.

00:28:10.735 --> 00:28:13.035
You could think I’m faking my memory loss.

00:28:13.695 --> 00:28:15.347
If you faked your memory loss,

00:28:18.465 --> 00:28:20.065
you wouldn’t have met up with me, Pleng.

00:28:21.575 --> 00:28:22.899
You wouldn’t have come here.

00:28:26.895 --> 00:28:28.171
You wouldn’t be here.

00:28:46.275 --> 00:28:47.355
You know what?

00:28:47.375 --> 00:28:49.699
They say “a lot can happen in a day”,

00:28:49.723 --> 00:28:51.403
and I only understand what it means today.

00:28:55.055 --> 00:28:56.299
It’s unbelievable.

00:29:01.815 --> 00:29:02.815
Do you

00:29:05.235 --> 00:29:06.579
believe in coincidences?

00:29:11.715 --> 00:29:12.715
Maybe?

00:29:13.765 --> 00:29:14.765
Believe it or not,

00:29:15.065 --> 00:29:16.907
ever since I became a journalist,

00:29:17.331 --> 00:29:19.699
the damn real life is full of coincidences

00:29:19.715 --> 00:29:20.915
even more than in soap operas.

00:29:23.575 --> 00:29:25.099
Did young master Botpleng

00:29:26.715 --> 00:29:27.715
just say “damn”?

00:29:34.735 --> 00:29:35.735
Do I

00:29:36.775 --> 00:29:38.435
not say that normally?

00:29:40.299 --> 00:29:42.867
Not a single swear word.

00:29:48.175 --> 00:29:49.979
It’s been 10 years.

00:29:50.495 --> 00:29:52.323
Things can change.

00:29:53.055 --> 00:29:55.907
Also, I lost my memories.

00:29:56.675 --> 00:29:58.419
I can’t remember my life back then.

00:30:02.735 --> 00:30:03.779
People

00:30:07.025 --> 00:30:08.651
can really forget about their lives?

00:30:18.939 --> 00:30:20.483
Is this your goal?

00:30:22.915 --> 00:30:23.915
Yes.

00:30:27.705 --> 00:30:30.387
I want Pleng’s memories to return.

00:30:31.775 --> 00:30:32.775
Why?

00:30:33.745 --> 00:30:35.243
What if I say

00:30:42.385 --> 00:30:44.051
because I want back that Botpleng

00:30:46.363 --> 00:30:47.835
who was Tankhun’s?

00:30:51.685 --> 00:30:52.899
What would you say?

00:31:14.575 --> 00:31:15.683
I haven’t forgotten.

00:31:18.105 --> 00:31:19.715
The first time we touched.

00:31:37.095 --> 00:31:38.131
The first time

00:31:40.435 --> 00:31:42.091
I taught you how to play the violin.

00:32:01.745 --> 00:32:03.075
I can’t remember.

00:32:04.985 --> 00:32:06.225
Go with the flow of your heart.

00:32:10.065 --> 00:32:11.587
I’ll never hurt you.

00:32:56.055 --> 00:32:57.595
I saw him

00:32:57.619 --> 00:32:59.483
after following the sound of the violin

00:32:59.507 --> 00:33:01.091
all the way to that tree.

00:33:14.285 --> 00:33:15.285
Uh…

00:33:16.059 --> 00:33:17.131
Hi.

00:33:22.815 --> 00:33:24.355
He said his name was Tankhun.

00:33:26.735 --> 00:33:30.003
We met in winter when we were 17.

00:33:48.095 --> 00:33:51.099
Tan made me enjoy the violin
for the first time.

00:33:53.971 --> 00:33:55.975
Just like getting to know love
for the first time.

00:34:47.315 --> 00:34:48.739
I really can’t remember.

00:34:52.355 --> 00:34:53.355
I’m sorry.

00:34:54.695 --> 00:34:55.771
It’s totally fine.

00:35:03.355 --> 00:35:06.347
I can’t even remember myself.

00:35:07.305 --> 00:35:08.843
So how can I remember him?

00:35:10.765 --> 00:35:12.443
If I were to remember myself,

00:35:13.145 --> 00:35:14.915
will I be able to remember him?

00:35:16.735 --> 00:35:19.035
Why do I want to be able
to remember this badly?

00:35:20.505 --> 00:35:22.579
On Christmas of 2025,

00:35:23.135 --> 00:35:26.259
the christmas songs could be heard
from the village’s office.

00:35:26.685 --> 00:35:30.347
I felt familiar with every melody I heard.

00:35:45.335 --> 00:35:46.931
But in that moment,

00:35:46.955 --> 00:35:51.043
I felt like I’ve actually become Botpleng

00:35:51.895 --> 00:35:53.651
when I’m in his embrace.

00:35:58.675 --> 00:36:00.675
He was the final melody

00:36:02.843 --> 00:36:04.845
that completed me.

00:36:11.635 --> 00:36:13.635
What was your first kiss like?

00:36:14.285 --> 00:36:15.707
I lost my memories.

00:36:17.465 --> 00:36:18.963
Something felt familiar.

00:36:19.815 --> 00:36:21.387
While some didn’t.

00:36:28.005 --> 00:36:30.531
I know I’ve kissed him before.

00:36:33.135 --> 00:36:34.963
But this kiss,

00:36:34.995 --> 00:36:37.659
made me feel like it’s my first kiss.

00:36:41.025 --> 00:36:42.683
Nothing felt familiar

00:36:43.455 --> 00:36:45.691
but my instinct tells me to keep going.

00:36:57.215 --> 00:36:59.707
I used to think Tankhun isn’t dangerous.

00:37:00.495 --> 00:37:01.907
I was probably wrong.

00:37:35.015 --> 00:37:37.683
That Christmas night was the coldest night
in winter.

00:37:37.731 --> 00:37:39.685
Yet, I was all hot.

00:37:41.395 --> 00:37:43.667
As if a steam was coming from him and me.

00:37:44.525 --> 00:37:46.091
We made it up together.

00:37:48.095 --> 00:37:49.315
He kissed me.

00:37:49.975 --> 00:37:51.211
We kissed.

00:37:51.755 --> 00:37:54.075
We could never get enough.

00:37:55.363 --> 00:37:57.683
We learned about each other’s bodies.

00:37:58.565 --> 00:38:03.307
The feeling of touching his skin
felt entirely different from mine.

00:38:05.085 --> 00:38:07.603
So did when he touched me.

00:38:08.695 --> 00:38:11.507
Our bodies moved like the melody
of a love song.

00:38:11.547 --> 00:38:14.011
Moving along the notes beautifully.

00:38:14.765 --> 00:38:17.059
Just like the melody of Canon in D.

00:38:18.425 --> 00:38:21.435
He touched all the parts
I never let anyone touch.

00:38:22.331 --> 00:38:23.987
We were each other’s first love

00:38:24.025 --> 00:38:26.187
and each other’s first time.

00:38:26.219 --> 00:38:28.895
But he was the last melody

00:38:28.923 --> 00:38:30.895
that completed me.

00:38:39.255 --> 00:38:40.255
Sorry.

00:38:47.175 --> 00:38:48.175
Yeah?

00:38:48.375 --> 00:38:51.171
(The police found another dead body
died in the same way.)

00:39:01.115 --> 00:39:03.115
Alright, I’ll be right there.

00:39:08.725 --> 00:39:09.995
Where are you going?

00:39:11.525 --> 00:39:13.565
The police found a dead body
not far away from here.

00:39:14.955 --> 00:39:15.955
When?

00:39:16.335 --> 00:39:17.491
An hour ago.

00:39:17.531 --> 00:39:18.531
I’m heading there to see.

00:39:18.935 --> 00:39:20.315
Are you a criminal journalist?

00:39:22.835 --> 00:39:24.323
Is your agency trying to report this

00:39:24.363 --> 00:39:26.483
before the others do?

00:39:28.531 --> 00:39:32.211
Can you tell that much
from my body language?

00:39:36.099 --> 00:39:38.095
If you’re not ready to keep going with me

00:39:38.825 --> 00:39:39.825
then just say so.

00:39:40.555 --> 00:39:42.107
I’ll leave.

00:39:43.555 --> 00:39:44.923
But I want you to have some rest.

00:39:45.535 --> 00:39:47.451
Even if you go to the crime scene now,

00:39:47.491 --> 00:39:48.931
you wouldn’t get anything out of it.

00:39:49.659 --> 00:39:51.655
The police need time to collect the information

00:39:51.683 --> 00:39:52.883
and do a deep investigation.

00:39:53.905 --> 00:39:55.307
You can just keep it short.

00:40:00.205 --> 00:40:01.307
I’m worried about you.

00:40:26.735 --> 00:40:27.571
Hello?

00:40:27.595 --> 00:40:28.595
(Dude.)

00:40:29.085 --> 00:40:29.883
Send me your location.

00:40:29.907 --> 00:40:30.907
I’m going to pick you up.

00:40:31.895 --> 00:40:34.875
I think we should go tomorrow.

00:40:35.331 --> 00:40:36.907
Let the police do their job for now.

00:40:39.415 --> 00:40:40.859
You’ve never been this way before.

00:40:41.265 --> 00:40:42.265
What’s keeping you up?

00:40:44.895 --> 00:40:46.227
I’m at Tankhun’s house.

00:40:49.185 --> 00:40:50.515
Are you hooked on him now?

00:40:51.415 --> 00:40:53.203
Why so quick on the spark?

00:40:53.805 --> 00:40:55.155
Keep it down.

00:40:55.735 --> 00:40:56.907
You should keep it down.

00:40:57.475 --> 00:40:59.227
You know this is weird,

00:40:59.267 --> 00:41:00.587
so you should be careful.

00:41:01.375 --> 00:41:02.955
(Don’t trust Tankhun.)

00:41:03.655 --> 00:41:05.171
(Hurry up and come back already.)

00:41:05.203 --> 00:41:06.203
Understood?

00:41:06.715 --> 00:41:07.419
Yeah.

00:41:07.435 --> 00:41:08.435
I understand everything.

00:41:08.615 --> 00:41:10.243
But I can’t leave just yet.

00:41:10.563 --> 00:41:12.565
I need to find out more about him.

00:41:12.835 --> 00:41:14.515
So you’re going to ditch your job?

00:41:17.035 --> 00:41:19.035
Don’t say that to me, Mile.

00:41:21.135 --> 00:41:22.939
You know full well.

00:41:23.347 --> 00:41:25.345
You have local reporters here.

00:41:25.379 --> 00:41:27.075
And the fact that you’re calling me

00:41:27.115 --> 00:41:28.579
is not just because of work, right?

00:41:28.971 --> 00:41:30.975
You just don’t want me to be here.

00:41:54.725 --> 00:41:58.075
Tankhun has a scar on his left wrist, a long line.

00:41:58.115 --> 00:41:59.547
I want to help Botpleng.

00:41:59.563 --> 00:42:01.531
I’m confident that he’s not the culprit.

00:42:01.587 --> 00:42:03.043
Isn’t it too much of a coincidence

00:42:03.075 --> 00:42:05.707
that you encounter Tankhun and the dead body at the same time?

00:42:05.723 --> 00:42:07.347
Then he’s trying to use you as a witness.

00:42:07.371 --> 00:42:09.099
What do I have for him to use me?

00:42:09.123 --> 00:42:11.139
And now he’s the only one who protects me

00:42:11.163 --> 00:42:12.923
and helps me trace my memories back.

00:42:12.947 --> 00:42:15.555
I’m going to prove to you that this Tankhun

00:42:15.587 --> 00:42:16.475
is not the real one.

00:42:16.515 --> 00:42:19.931
The autopsy result revealed that both cases died in the same manner.

00:42:19.963 --> 00:42:21.935
That is strangling with garrote knots.

00:42:21.955 --> 00:42:24.659
No one can ever hurt you. I’ll protect you.
